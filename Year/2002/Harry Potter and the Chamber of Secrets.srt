1
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,309
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:19,021
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,358
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon...
- Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:26,820
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,328
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,459
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,419
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:47,091
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:51,220
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:56,517
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,352
Not one...

12
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,229
...all summer.

13
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:03,649
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:08,362
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,032
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,326
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:17,037
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:19,706
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:23,210
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,713
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

21
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,799
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

22
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:32,678
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:36,765
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:38,851
Excellent.

25
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,232
And you?

26
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:50,195
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

27
00:02:50,362 --> 00:02:52,072
Too right, you will.

28
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,743
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

29
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,455
...and you will not mess it up.

30
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:15,429
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

31
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:23,228
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

32
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,314
Not to be rude or anything...

33
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:29,443
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

34
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,112
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

35
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,407
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

36
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:40,412
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

37
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,376
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

38
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,134
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

39
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,470
Offend Dobby?

40
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,972
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

41
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:04,937
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

42
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,482
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

43
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,068
No, I haven't.

44
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:13,987
That was an awful thing to say.

45
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:18,117
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

46
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:19,660
Dobby, please, stop.

47
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,792
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

48
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,257
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

49
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:35,717
Are you all right?

50
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:39,346
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

51
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,724
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

52
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:46,854
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

53
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,023
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

54
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,735
If they ever knew Dobby was here...

55
00:04:54,361 --> 00:05:00,159
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

56
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,619
Harry Potter must not go back...

57
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:07,499
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

58
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:12,838
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

59
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:16,341
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

60
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,678
Can't say.

61
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:25,851
- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. I...

62
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:30,564
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.

63
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:34,777
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole...

64
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:39,948
Give me the lamp.

65
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:44,078
Dobby, stop!

66
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:49,249
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.

67
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,462
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just...

68
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:56,381
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

69
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,383
Sorry.

70
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:04,014
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

71
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:07,976
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,897
See why I've got to go back?

73
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:15,818
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

74
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:20,614
- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

75
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,700
Well, I expect they've been...

76
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:28,539
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

77
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:32,084
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

78
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:36,463
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

79
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,300
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

80
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:45,889
- Give me those. Now.
- No!

81
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:01,488
Dobby, get back here.

82
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,995
Dobby, please, no.

83
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:12,332
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

84
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,127
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

85
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:21,383
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

86
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,555
It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

87
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,682
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water."

88
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,852
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it."

89
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:47,701
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

90
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:52,206
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

91
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:06,386
You're never going back to that school.

92
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:11,600
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

93
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,897
Hiya, Harry.

94
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:04,445
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

95
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,490
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

96
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:16,915
You better stand back.

97
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:19,460
Let's go.

98
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:26,133
- What was that?
- What was it?

99
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,637
Potter!

100
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,473
Dad, what's going on?

101
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:36,769
Go. Go. Go.

102
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:37,978
Dad, hurry up.

103
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,024
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.

104
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,819
Petunia, he's escaping!

105
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,531
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!

106
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,825
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!

107
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,995
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

108
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,789
- Get off!
- Drive!

109
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,832
- Right.
- Right!

110
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,667
No! No! No! No!

111
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:06,840
Dad!

112
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,476
Damn.

113
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:25,484
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

114
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,595
Come on.

115
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:58,225
Okay, come on.

116
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,270
Okay, come on.

117
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:13,574
- Think it'd be all right if we had some?
- Yeah, Mum will never know.

118
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,469
It's not much, but it's home.

119
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:35,929
I think it's brilliant.

120
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,434
Where have you been?

121
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,896
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

122
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:47,649
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

123
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:50,819
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

124
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:54,031
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

125
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:57,242
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

126
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:02,164
Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

127
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:04,458
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

128
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:08,378
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

129
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:12,132
That's it. There we go.

130
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:16,136
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

131
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,388
Hello.

132
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:24,103
What did I do?

133
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:28,857
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

134
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,652
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.

135
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:36,365
- What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
- Raids?

136
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:40,494
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

137
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:43,997
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

138
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,375
Well, now.

139
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:49,503
And who are you?

140
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:53,841
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

141
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:57,136
Good Lord. Are you really?

142
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:02,015
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

143
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,684
This morning.

144
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:09,064
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

145
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:12,693
Did you really? How did it go?

146
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,698
I mean... That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

147
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:22,870
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

148
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,166
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

149
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:34,506
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

150
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:43,056
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

151
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,602
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.

152
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,232
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

153
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,444
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

154
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:57,571
- No.
- This lot won't come cheap.

155
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:02,076
- The spell books alone are expensive.
- We'll manage.

156
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:07,039
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

157
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,666
Right.

158
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,960
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

159
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:15,089
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

160
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,298
Floo powder?

161
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:20,761
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

162
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:23,263
In you go.

163
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:25,307
That's it.

164
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:30,521
Diagon Alley.

165
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:40,072
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

166
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:43,033
Come on.

167
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,412
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

168
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:49,998
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

169
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:54,002
That's it, very good.

170
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:58,507
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

171
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:02,719
Diagonally.

172
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:11,603
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

173
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,855
I thought he did.

174
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:44,154
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...

175
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:48,826
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

176
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:51,703
- No. Please...
- Harry?

177
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,955
Hagrid!

178
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:56,125
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

179
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:07,177
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

180
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:11,348
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

181
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:13,767
I was lost, I...

182
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:16,895
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

183
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:22,192
Me? I was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

184
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,279
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

185
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,870
Harry. Hagrid.

186
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:34,496
Hello, Hermione.

187
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:37,499
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

188
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,753
What did you do to your glasses?

189
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,797
Oculus Reparo.

190
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:50,012
I definitely need to remember that one.

191
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:53,891
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

192
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:55,517
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

193
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,686
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

194
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:09,531
Harry.

195
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:12,910
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

196
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:15,913
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

197
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,373
Here he is.

198
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:24,004
Mum fancies him.

199
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:27,424
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

200
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:31,053
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

201
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:38,102
It can't be. Harry Potter?

202
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:41,522
Harry Potter!

203
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,898
Excuse me, madam.

204
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,737
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.

205
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:52,074
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

206
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:55,661
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

207
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:59,915
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

208
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,296
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

209
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:11,301
...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

210
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:15,973
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

211
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:22,062
...with my entire collected works...

212
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,857
...free of charge.

213
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:29,278
Now, ladies?

214
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:32,614
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

215
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:36,285
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

216
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:48,088
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

217
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:52,760
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

218
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:55,095
Leave him alone.

219
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:58,766
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

220
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:02,978
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

221
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:04,605
Mr. Potter.

222
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:11,028
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

223
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:13,405
Forgive me.

224
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,825
Your scar is legend.

225
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:19,620
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

226
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:22,122
Voldemort killed my parents.

227
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,669
He was nothing more than a murderer.

228
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:31,632
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

229
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,634
Or very foolish.

230
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:37,596
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

231
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:42,476
And you must be Miss Granger.

232
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:49,608
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

233
00:20:54,238 --> 00:20:57,699
Muggles, aren't they?

234
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:05,749
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

235
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:10,504
...tatty, secondhand book.

236
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:14,049
You must be the Weasleys.

237
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,510
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

238
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:20,389
- Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
- Lucius.

239
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:25,269
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

240
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:27,771
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

241
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:31,108
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

242
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:36,655
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

243
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:38,907
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

244
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:44,204
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

245
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:46,248
Clearly.

246
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:52,045
Associating with Muggles.

247
00:21:56,258 --> 00:22:00,846
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

248
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:06,935
I'll see you at work.

249
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:13,442
See you at school.

250
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:23,952
- 10:58, come on.
- The train will be leaving any moment.

251
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,414
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

252
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,630
Okay.

253
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,429
After you, dear.

254
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:47,810
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

255
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:51,188
Let's go.

256
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,288
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.

257
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:11,708
Lost control of the trolley.

258
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:15,379
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.

259
00:23:15,546 --> 00:23:18,924
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

260
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,221
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.

261
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:27,766
Harry, if we can't get through...

262
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,728
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

263
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:35,149
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

264
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:37,526
The car.

265
00:23:49,037 --> 00:23:51,206
Ron, I should tell you...

266
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:55,169
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

267
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:56,420
Right.

268
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:57,755
Okay.

269
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:18,358
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

270
00:24:18,817 --> 00:24:21,945
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

271
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,405
Okay.

272
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,376
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

273
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,212
We can't be far behind.

274
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:42,925
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.

275
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,469
Hold on.

276
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:13,956
Harry!

277
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,419
Hold on!

278
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:24,258
Take my hand!

279
00:25:28,512 --> 00:25:29,763
Hold on!

280
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,517
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

281
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:49,408
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.

282
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:07,342
Welcome home.

283
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:24,693
Up! Up!

284
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,821
It's not working!

285
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:34,328
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

286
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:39,708
Stop! Stop! Stop!

287
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:07,444
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.

288
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:12,074
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

289
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:49,653
Come on, go! Fast!

290
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:26,815
Scabbers, you're okay.

291
00:28:28,317 --> 00:28:30,360
The car!

292
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:47,669
Dad's gonna kill me.

293
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,555
See you, Hedwig.

294
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,226
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

295
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:05,354
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 93/4...

296
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:08,774
...we almost get killed by a tree...

297
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:12,486
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

298
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:19,034
Well, take a good look, lads.

299
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:23,122
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

300
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:29,420
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

301
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:35,884
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

302
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:39,096
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

303
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:43,642
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

304
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:47,229
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

305
00:29:47,396 --> 00:29:50,566
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

306
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:54,570
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.

307
00:29:54,737 --> 00:29:55,904
Silence.

308
00:29:57,906 --> 00:30:04,288
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

309
00:30:04,455 --> 00:30:08,250
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

310
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:11,670
- As it is...
- They are not.

311
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:17,926
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

312
00:30:18,302 --> 00:30:19,803
Headmaster...

313
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,767
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

314
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:28,854
- As such...
- I am well aware of our bylaws...

315
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:31,899
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

316
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:35,486
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

317
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:40,657
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

318
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:43,285
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

319
00:30:43,452 --> 00:30:45,913
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

320
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,290
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

321
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:52,961
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

322
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:58,133
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

323
00:30:58,675 --> 00:31:03,305
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

324
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:30,165
Morning, everyone.

325
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:33,377
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

326
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:37,840
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

327
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:40,843
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

328
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:45,013
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

329
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,015
Yes, Miss Granger?

330
00:31:47,182 --> 00:31:49,518
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

331
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:54,690
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

332
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:59,862
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

333
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:02,865
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

334
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:05,701
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

335
00:32:05,868 --> 00:32:07,786
...their cries won't kill you yet.

336
00:32:07,953 --> 00:32:11,749
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

337
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:13,417
...for auditory protection.

338
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:18,046
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

339
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:21,008
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

340
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:24,178
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

341
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:27,347
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

342
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:33,520
Got it? And...

343
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:35,856
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

344
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:40,736
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

345
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:47,576
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

346
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:52,039
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

347
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:55,959
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

348
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:59,713
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

349
00:33:14,645 --> 00:33:18,440
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

350
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:21,151
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

351
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:35,916
Say it. I'm doomed.

352
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,669
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.

353
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:43,632
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

354
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,426
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

355
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:47,803
Ron, is that your owl?

356
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:05,195
Bloody bird's a menace.

357
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:10,909
Oh, no.

358
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:14,538
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

359
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:21,253
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

360
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:30,304
Ronald Weasley!

361
00:34:32,931 --> 00:34:39,021
How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!

362
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:41,899
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...

363
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:44,443
...and it's entirely your fault!

364
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:48,781
If you put another toe out of line...

365
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:52,201
...we'll bring you straight home!

366
00:34:52,993 --> 00:34:56,497
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.

367
00:34:56,663 --> 00:35:00,375
Your father and I are so proud.

368
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:25,067
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

369
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:26,777
Me.

370
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:29,488
Gilderoy Lockhart...

371
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:32,950
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

372
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:36,453
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

373
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,540
...and five times winner...

374
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:45,754
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

375
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,631
But I don't talk about that.

376
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:52,344
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

377
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:58,934
Now, be warned.

378
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:01,270
It is my job to arm you...

379
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:06,775
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

380
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:11,196
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

381
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:15,409
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

382
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:18,495
I must ask you not to scream.

383
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:21,248
It might provoke them.

384
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,253
Cornish pixies?

385
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,465
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

386
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:32,384
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

387
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:36,722
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

388
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:39,808
Let's see what you make of them.

389
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:47,399
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

390
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:07,294
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!

391
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,091
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

392
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:16,929
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

393
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:41,203
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

394
00:37:42,955 --> 00:37:45,124
What do we do now?

395
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,085
Immobulus!

396
00:37:57,594 --> 00:37:59,847
Why is it always me?

397
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:08,897
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

398
00:38:09,064 --> 00:38:12,735
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

399
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:16,196
What...? I don't believe it.

400
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:21,702
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

401
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:26,248
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

402
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,877
I smell trouble.

403
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:34,006
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

404
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:37,676
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

405
00:38:37,843 --> 00:38:40,512
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

406
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:47,102
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

407
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:50,064
And that's not all
that's new this year.

408
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:54,318
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?

409
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:56,570
A gift from Draco's father.

410
00:38:56,737 --> 00:39:00,491
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

411
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:03,660
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

412
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:06,747
They got in on pure talent.

413
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:13,837
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

414
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,802
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

415
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:29,228
You okay, Ron?

416
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:34,024
Say something.

417
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,785
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.

418
00:39:45,702 --> 00:39:47,746
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

419
00:39:47,913 --> 00:39:50,040
He'll know what to do.

420
00:39:58,924 --> 00:40:02,302
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

421
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:09,643
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

422
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,480
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

423
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:19,403
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

424
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:24,032
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

425
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:30,205
He called me a Mudblood.

426
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:33,041
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

427
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:37,963
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.

428
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,384
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

429
00:40:42,885 --> 00:40:47,014
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

430
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:52,978
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

431
00:40:53,145 --> 00:40:57,816
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

432
00:40:57,983 --> 00:40:59,610
That's horrible.

433
00:41:02,613 --> 00:41:03,947
It's disgusting.

434
00:41:04,114 --> 00:41:07,618
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

435
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:11,163
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

436
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:15,876
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

437
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:18,253
Come here.

438
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:25,844
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

439
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:36,647
Harry, Harry, Harry.

440
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:39,066
Can you possibly imagine...

441
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:42,444
...a better way to serve detention...

442
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,781
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

443
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:47,366
Not really.

444
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:53,914
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

445
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,999
Remember that.

446
00:41:59,753 --> 00:42:01,922
Come.

447
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:04,216
Come...

448
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:08,345
...to me.

449
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,184
- What?
- Sorry?

450
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:18,397
That voice.

451
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:20,107
Voice?

452
00:42:23,652 --> 00:42:28,282
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

453
00:42:28,907 --> 00:42:32,494
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

454
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:36,749
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

455
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,419
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

456
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:47,926
Spooky.

457
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:53,098
Blood.

458
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:56,810
I smell blood.

459
00:42:56,977 --> 00:43:00,064
Let me rip you.

460
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,817
Let me kill you.

461
00:43:05,652 --> 00:43:07,112
Kill!

462
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,364
Kill!

463
00:43:10,074 --> 00:43:11,992
- Kill!
- Harry!

464
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,661
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

465
00:43:14,828 --> 00:43:18,248
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

466
00:43:18,415 --> 00:43:22,377
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just...

467
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:24,755
It's time.

468
00:43:24,922 --> 00:43:28,133
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

469
00:43:29,093 --> 00:43:33,055
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!

470
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:00,707
Strange.

471
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:05,712
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.

472
00:44:09,842 --> 00:44:11,885
What's that?

473
00:44:15,347 --> 00:44:19,893
"The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."

474
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,312
It's written in blood.

475
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:27,401
Oh, no.

476
00:44:32,114 --> 00:44:34,408
It's Filch's cat.

477
00:44:34,908 --> 00:44:37,202
It's Mrs. Norris.

478
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,971
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

479
00:44:57,473 --> 00:44:59,850
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

480
00:45:00,017 --> 00:45:05,189
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

481
00:45:06,648 --> 00:45:08,484
Potter?

482
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,778
What are you...?

483
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:16,408
Mrs. Norris?

484
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:22,081
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

485
00:45:22,456 --> 00:45:23,749
I'll kill you.

486
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:28,921
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!

487
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:32,466
Argus, I...

488
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:39,098
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

489
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:41,809
Everyone except...

490
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:44,812
...you three.

491
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:49,691
Ravenclaws, follow me.

492
00:45:51,568 --> 00:45:55,447
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

493
00:45:55,614 --> 00:45:58,450
Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

494
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:01,829
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

495
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:06,792
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.

496
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:09,753
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

497
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,631
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

498
00:46:12,798 --> 00:46:16,885
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

499
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:21,515
- Rubbish.
- If I might, headmaster?

500
00:46:21,974 --> 00:46:26,770
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

501
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:29,189
However...

502
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:32,484
...the circumstances are suspicious.

503
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:37,281
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

504
00:46:37,448 --> 00:46:39,700
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

505
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:43,287
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

506
00:46:43,454 --> 00:46:46,749
That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

507
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:49,668
We'd just found him when he said...

508
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,758
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

509
00:46:57,134 --> 00:47:01,138
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

510
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:09,021
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
- My cat has been Petrified.

511
00:47:09,855 --> 00:47:15,694
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

512
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:21,408
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

513
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:25,996
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

514
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,040
And in the meantime...

515
00:47:28,582 --> 00:47:32,586
...I strongly recommend caution...

516
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:35,255
...to all.

517
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:49,728
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

518
00:47:49,895 --> 00:47:52,648
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

519
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:57,528
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

520
00:47:57,694 --> 00:48:00,948
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

521
00:48:01,115 --> 00:48:02,574
Are you mad?

522
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:08,247
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

523
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:12,709
She's right, you know.

524
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:19,383
Could I have your attention,
please?

525
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:25,431
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

526
00:48:25,597 --> 00:48:27,975
...into water goblets.

527
00:48:28,892 --> 00:48:30,561
Like so.

528
00:48:30,728 --> 00:48:35,649
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

529
00:48:39,194 --> 00:48:43,115
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

530
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:48,662
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto."

531
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:54,334
Vera Verto!

532
00:49:00,466 --> 00:49:03,135
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.

533
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,638
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

534
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:11,018
...I was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

535
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:18,442
Very well.

536
00:49:19,943 --> 00:49:21,945
You all know, of course...

537
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:25,991
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

538
00:49:26,158 --> 00:49:30,579
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

539
00:49:30,746 --> 00:49:34,500
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

540
00:49:34,666 --> 00:49:40,297
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

541
00:49:40,964 --> 00:49:46,970
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

542
00:49:47,137 --> 00:49:50,182
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

543
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:53,352
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

544
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:56,688
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

545
00:49:56,855 --> 00:50:01,443
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

546
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,737
In other words, pure-bloods.

547
00:50:04,113 --> 00:50:09,451
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

548
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:12,538
Now, according to legend...

549
00:50:12,704 --> 00:50:16,417
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

550
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:20,254
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

551
00:50:20,421 --> 00:50:24,842
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

552
00:50:25,008 --> 00:50:29,138
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

553
00:50:29,304 --> 00:50:31,682
The Heir alone...

554
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:34,518
...would be able to open the Chamber...

555
00:50:34,685 --> 00:50:39,440
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

556
00:50:39,606 --> 00:50:42,985
...purge the school
of all those who...

557
00:50:43,152 --> 00:50:48,157
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

558
00:50:48,782 --> 00:50:50,909
Muggle-borns.

559
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:55,581
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

560
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:59,209
No such chamber has been found.

561
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:04,465
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

562
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:07,885
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

563
00:51:08,052 --> 00:51:11,638
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

564
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:15,893
It is said to be the home...

565
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,686
...of a monster.

566
00:51:23,442 --> 00:51:27,112
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

567
00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:31,492
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

568
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:35,496
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means...

569
00:51:35,662 --> 00:51:39,625
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

570
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:44,171
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

571
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:47,007
- If you're talking about Malfoy...
- Of course. You heard him.

572
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:48,884
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

573
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:51,678
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

574
00:51:51,845 --> 00:51:55,015
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

575
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:57,976
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

576
00:51:58,143 --> 00:52:01,563
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

577
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:06,193
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

578
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,195
Mind you, it would be difficult.

579
00:52:08,362 --> 00:52:11,407
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

580
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:16,036
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

581
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:25,337
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

582
00:52:25,504 --> 00:52:28,215
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

583
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:32,636
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

584
00:52:32,803 --> 00:52:36,598
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

585
00:52:36,765 --> 00:52:40,144
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

586
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:44,189
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

587
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:47,443
- How long will it take to make?
- A month.

588
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:49,278
A month?

589
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:53,282
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

590
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:56,660
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

591
00:52:56,827 --> 00:52:58,746
I know.

592
00:52:58,912 --> 00:53:01,749
But it's the only plan we've got.

593
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:54,134
Another goal for Slytherin!

594
00:53:55,552 --> 00:53:58,847
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

595
00:54:00,015 --> 00:54:01,600
Yeah!

596
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,644
Yeah!

597
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:30,212
All right there, Scarhead?

598
00:54:36,343 --> 00:54:38,846
Watch yourself, Harry!

599
00:54:39,221 --> 00:54:41,014
Wood, look out!

600
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:57,531
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

601
00:54:57,698 --> 00:54:59,450
That's been tampered with, that has.

602
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:01,535
I'll stop it.

603
00:55:01,702 --> 00:55:06,290
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

604
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:33,942
Training for the ballet, Potter?

605
00:56:04,932 --> 00:56:07,142
You'll never catch me, Potter.

606
00:57:37,941 --> 00:57:39,026
Let's go.

607
00:57:39,193 --> 00:57:44,406
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!

608
00:57:50,704 --> 00:57:52,748
Finite Incantatem!

609
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:01,173
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

610
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,425
No. I think my arm is broken.

611
00:58:03,592 --> 00:58:07,388
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

612
00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:10,516
- Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

613
00:58:10,682 --> 00:58:14,228
This won't hurt a bit.

614
00:58:20,317 --> 00:58:23,320
Brackium Emendo!

615
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:34,456
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

616
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,875
...but the point is...

617
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:42,381
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

618
00:58:42,548 --> 00:58:45,217
Broken? There's no bones left.

619
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:48,887
Much more flexible, though.

620
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:55,269
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

621
00:58:55,436 --> 00:58:57,396
Should have been brought
straight to me.

622
00:58:57,563 --> 00:59:00,107
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...

623
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:01,775
You will be able to, won't you?

624
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:05,070
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

625
00:59:05,696 --> 00:59:10,367
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

626
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:16,290
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

627
00:59:22,921 --> 00:59:24,673
Kill.

628
00:59:25,507 --> 00:59:27,051
Kill.

629
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:35,642
Time to kill.

630
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:42,816
Hello.

631
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:45,652
Dobby?

632
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:48,155
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

633
00:59:48,614 --> 00:59:52,326
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

634
00:59:52,493 --> 00:59:57,122
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

635
00:59:57,414 --> 01:00:00,376
Indeed. Yes, sir.

636
01:00:01,377 --> 01:00:06,423
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.

637
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:09,259
Harry Potter must go home.

638
01:00:09,426 --> 01:00:13,013
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see...

639
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,558
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

640
01:00:16,725 --> 01:00:20,312
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

641
01:00:20,479 --> 01:00:24,108
Dobby had to iron his hands.

642
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:30,906
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.

643
01:00:33,534 --> 01:00:35,536
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

644
01:00:35,702 --> 01:00:38,747
Dobby gets them five times a day
at home.

645
01:00:38,914 --> 01:00:41,709
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

646
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,879
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

647
01:00:46,046 --> 01:00:49,383
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

648
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:52,678
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

649
01:00:52,845 --> 01:00:56,557
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

650
01:00:56,724 --> 01:01:02,146
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

651
01:01:11,488 --> 01:01:14,116
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

652
01:01:14,283 --> 01:01:19,413
This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

653
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:24,710
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

654
01:01:26,837 --> 01:01:28,213
Listen.

655
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,923
Listen!

656
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,802
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

657
01:01:34,428 --> 01:01:36,889
Harry Potter must not stay here...

658
01:01:37,056 --> 01:01:41,602
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

659
01:01:41,769 --> 01:01:45,230
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

660
01:01:45,397 --> 01:01:47,399
I shouldn't have said that.

661
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:54,281
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!

662
01:01:54,448 --> 01:01:56,116
Stop it, Dobby!

663
01:01:57,785 --> 01:02:01,622
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

664
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:07,002
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

665
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:10,089
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

666
01:02:21,934 --> 01:02:23,018
Put him here.

667
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:30,526
- What happened?
- There's been another attack.

668
01:02:30,692 --> 01:02:36,490
I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

669
01:02:37,282 --> 01:02:41,995
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

670
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:52,840
What can this mean, Albus?

671
01:02:53,006 --> 01:02:54,967
It means...

672
01:02:55,342 --> 01:02:58,095
...that our students
are in great danger.

673
01:02:58,262 --> 01:03:01,682
- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.

674
01:03:01,932 --> 01:03:05,728
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

675
01:03:06,061 --> 01:03:09,022
It is as we feared, Minerva.

676
01:03:09,273 --> 01:03:13,819
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

677
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:20,784
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

678
01:03:20,951 --> 01:03:23,704
Of course.
Don't you see?

679
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:26,874
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

680
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:30,085
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.

681
01:03:30,252 --> 01:03:33,422
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

682
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:37,551
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

683
01:03:37,718 --> 01:03:41,680
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

684
01:03:42,556 --> 01:03:45,225
No. No one ever comes in here.

685
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,604
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.

686
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:50,731
Who?

687
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:52,900
Moaning Myrtle.

688
01:03:53,192 --> 01:03:56,528
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.

689
01:04:02,451 --> 01:04:04,828
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

690
01:04:04,995 --> 01:04:08,040
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

691
01:04:08,207 --> 01:04:11,585
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

692
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:20,928
She's a little sensitive.

693
01:04:25,432 --> 01:04:27,393
Gather round!

694
01:04:27,726 --> 01:04:32,731
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

695
01:04:32,898 --> 01:04:36,026
Can you all hear me?

696
01:04:36,693 --> 01:04:38,028
Excellent.

697
01:04:38,529 --> 01:04:42,241
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

698
01:04:42,408 --> 01:04:47,079
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

699
01:04:47,246 --> 01:04:51,917
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

700
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:54,712
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.

701
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,590
For full details,
see my published works.

702
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:06,432
Let me introduce my assistant...

703
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:09,226
...Professor Snape.

704
01:05:12,563 --> 01:05:15,357
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

705
01:05:15,524 --> 01:05:17,568
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

706
01:05:17,735 --> 01:05:22,656
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

707
01:05:38,297 --> 01:05:39,923
One.

708
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:41,133
Two.

709
01:05:41,925 --> 01:05:44,970
- Three!
- Expelliarmus!

710
01:05:53,562 --> 01:05:56,231
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?

711
01:05:56,398 --> 01:05:59,359
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

712
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:04,073
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
obvious what you were about to do.

713
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:07,493
If I had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

714
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:11,121
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

715
01:06:11,288 --> 01:06:15,793
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

716
01:06:17,544 --> 01:06:19,963
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

717
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:25,469
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

718
01:06:25,636 --> 01:06:29,139
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

719
01:06:29,556 --> 01:06:33,268
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

720
01:06:33,435 --> 01:06:37,523
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?

721
01:06:38,774 --> 01:06:41,276
Malfoy, perhaps?

722
01:06:48,784 --> 01:06:51,286
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.

723
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:01,255
Wands at the ready.

724
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,842
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.

725
01:07:15,269 --> 01:07:16,979
On the count of three...

726
01:07:17,146 --> 01:07:21,483
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

727
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:25,195
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

728
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:29,533
- Two.
- Everte Statum!

729
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,422
Rictusempra!

730
01:07:54,391 --> 01:07:56,185
I said disarm only.

731
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:58,353
Serpensortia!

732
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:09,823
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.

733
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:15,412
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!

734
01:08:57,955 --> 01:09:00,624
Vipera Evanesca.

735
01:09:07,339 --> 01:09:09,717
What are you playing at?

736
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,190
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

737
01:09:25,357 --> 01:09:27,609
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.

738
01:09:27,776 --> 01:09:33,115
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

739
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:37,244
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.

740
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:41,165
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.

741
01:09:41,665 --> 01:09:43,375
This is bad.

742
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:47,296
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin...

743
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:50,924
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.

744
01:09:51,091 --> 01:09:54,970
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

745
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:58,015
I spoke a different language?

746
01:09:59,099 --> 01:10:01,477
But I didn't realize...

747
01:10:01,643 --> 01:10:04,438
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

748
01:10:04,605 --> 01:10:08,609
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

749
01:10:08,776 --> 01:10:10,486
Harry, listen to me.

750
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:13,781
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

751
01:10:13,947 --> 01:10:18,452
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

752
01:10:18,702 --> 01:10:19,745
Exactly.

753
01:10:19,912 --> 01:10:23,290
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

754
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:25,459
But I'm not.

755
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,130
I can't be.

756
01:10:31,256 --> 01:10:33,300
He lived a thousand years ago.

757
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:36,678
For all we know, you could be.

758
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:09,169
I'll see you back in the common room.

759
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:29,857
I want blood.

760
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:37,740
They all must die.

761
01:11:38,323 --> 01:11:40,325
Kill.

762
01:11:40,993 --> 01:11:43,078
Kill.

763
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,165
Kill.

764
01:11:46,498 --> 01:11:50,544
Time to kill.

765
01:12:24,745 --> 01:12:26,663
Caught in the act.

766
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,791
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

767
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,794
Mark my words.

768
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,215
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...

769
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,910
Professor...

770
01:13:05,077 --> 01:13:06,453
...I swear I didn't.

771
01:13:06,662 --> 01:13:09,873
This is out of my hands, Potter.

772
01:13:19,508 --> 01:13:22,177
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

773
01:13:31,103 --> 01:13:33,689
Sherbet Lemon.

774
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:09,767
Professor Dumbledore?

775
01:14:26,241 --> 01:14:28,952
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

776
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:36,377
I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

777
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:42,007
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

778
01:14:42,174 --> 01:14:45,719
But I stand by what I said last year.

779
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:49,264
You would have done well in Slytherin.

780
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:50,766
You're wrong.

781
01:15:20,045 --> 01:15:21,463
Harry?

782
01:15:21,839 --> 01:15:24,091
Professor.

783
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:28,053
Your bird...
There was nothing I could do.

784
01:15:28,637 --> 01:15:31,974
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.

785
01:15:32,808 --> 01:15:35,144
He's been looking dreadful for days.

786
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:37,312
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

787
01:15:39,231 --> 01:15:42,484
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

788
01:15:42,651 --> 01:15:45,988
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

789
01:15:46,155 --> 01:15:48,282
...and then they are...

790
01:15:48,449 --> 01:15:51,493
...reborn from the ashes.

791
01:15:59,877 --> 01:16:02,504
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

792
01:16:02,963 --> 01:16:06,842
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

793
01:16:07,009 --> 01:16:09,845
Their tears have healing powers.

794
01:16:12,473 --> 01:16:15,517
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

795
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:18,645
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

796
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:22,691
I'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

797
01:16:24,151 --> 01:16:26,028
Relax.

798
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:28,739
I do not believe...

799
01:16:28,906 --> 01:16:32,409
...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

800
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:38,749
Right. Well, I'll...

801
01:16:38,957 --> 01:16:42,044
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

802
01:16:45,756 --> 01:16:49,385
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.

803
01:16:49,593 --> 01:16:52,054
I do not think it was you.

804
01:16:53,138 --> 01:16:54,932
But I must ask you...

805
01:16:55,516 --> 01:16:59,561
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

806
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:07,945
No, sir.

807
01:17:08,153 --> 01:17:09,613
Nothing.

808
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:14,785
Very well, then.

809
01:17:14,993 --> 01:17:16,787
Off you go.

810
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:58,245
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

811
01:17:58,454 --> 01:18:00,164
Crabbe and Goyle.

812
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:03,083
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

813
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:06,462
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

814
01:18:06,837 --> 01:18:09,506
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.

815
01:18:09,715 --> 01:18:12,259
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

816
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:15,220
Simple, but powerful.

817
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:17,556
Now, once they're asleep...

818
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:20,934
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

819
01:18:21,143 --> 01:18:23,020
...and put on their uniforms.

820
01:18:23,187 --> 01:18:26,440
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.

821
01:18:26,648 --> 01:18:29,777
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

822
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:32,112
I got this off her robes.

823
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,907
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

824
01:18:35,115 --> 01:18:37,785
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

825
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:52,299
Ron, maybe I should do it.

826
01:18:52,508 --> 01:18:54,510
Yeah. Right.

827
01:18:56,762 --> 01:18:58,555
Wingardium Leviosa.

828
01:19:08,732 --> 01:19:10,359
Cool.

829
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:35,300
How thick could you get?

830
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:37,428
Come on, let's get them.

831
01:19:40,139 --> 01:19:44,101
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

832
01:19:52,317 --> 01:19:54,278
Add the hairs.

833
01:19:58,824 --> 01:20:00,534
Essence of Crabbe.

834
01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:02,619
Cheers.

835
01:20:11,336 --> 01:20:13,714
I think I'm gonna be sick.

836
01:20:16,675 --> 01:20:18,469
Me too.

837
01:21:03,389 --> 01:21:05,099
Harry?

838
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:07,142
Ron.

839
01:21:07,893 --> 01:21:10,020
Bloody hell!

840
01:21:10,854 --> 01:21:13,107
We still sound like ourselves.

841
01:21:13,315 --> 01:21:15,025
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

842
01:21:16,235 --> 01:21:18,487
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

843
01:21:18,862 --> 01:21:21,323
- But where's Hermione?
- I...

844
01:21:21,532 --> 01:21:24,535
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

845
01:21:24,702 --> 01:21:26,412
Hermione, are you okay?

846
01:21:26,578 --> 01:21:29,415
Just go. You're wasting time.

847
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,127
Come on.

848
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:39,967
I think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

849
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:45,431
Excuse me.

850
01:21:47,266 --> 01:21:49,143
What are you doing d...?

851
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:51,395
I mean, what are you doing down here?

852
01:21:53,355 --> 01:21:56,024
I happen to be a school prefect.

853
01:21:56,233 --> 01:22:00,696
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

854
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,073
What are your names again?

855
01:22:03,282 --> 01:22:07,244
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?

856
01:22:07,453 --> 01:22:10,456
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

857
01:22:11,999 --> 01:22:14,251
Why are you wearing glasses?

858
01:22:15,127 --> 01:22:17,963
- Reading.
- Reading?

859
01:22:19,131 --> 01:22:21,383
I didn't know you could read.

860
01:22:24,303 --> 01:22:26,346
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

861
01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:28,557
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

862
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:39,359
Well, sit down.

863
01:22:42,196 --> 01:22:45,991
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

864
01:22:46,241 --> 01:22:50,037
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

865
01:22:50,913 --> 01:22:53,165
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

866
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:57,127
Stomachache.

867
01:22:59,171 --> 01:23:03,967
I'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

868
01:23:04,176 --> 01:23:06,595
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

869
01:23:06,929 --> 01:23:09,264
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

870
01:23:09,473 --> 01:23:13,227
...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

871
01:23:20,776 --> 01:23:21,902
What?

872
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:25,739
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

873
01:23:25,948 --> 01:23:28,325
Well? Do you?

874
01:23:28,909 --> 01:23:30,744
Harry Potter?

875
01:23:37,334 --> 01:23:38,711
Good one, Goyle.

876
01:23:38,919 --> 01:23:40,462
You're absolutely right.

877
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:42,923
Saint Potter.

878
01:23:43,966 --> 01:23:46,719
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

879
01:23:50,514 --> 01:23:53,100
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

880
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:56,937
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

881
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:00,441
How many times do I have to tell you?

882
01:24:01,483 --> 01:24:03,277
Is this yours?

883
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:10,117
But my father did say this:

884
01:24:10,534 --> 01:24:13,454
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

885
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:18,000
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

886
01:24:18,292 --> 01:24:22,921
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

887
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:27,426
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

888
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:29,803
As for me...

889
01:24:30,012 --> 01:24:32,139
...I hope it's Granger.

890
01:24:32,347 --> 01:24:34,516
What's the matter with you two?

891
01:24:34,725 --> 01:24:37,186
You're acting very odd.

892
01:24:37,394 --> 01:24:39,563
It's his stomachache.

893
01:24:39,772 --> 01:24:41,815
Calm down.

894
01:24:46,028 --> 01:24:47,988
Scar.

895
01:24:51,617 --> 01:24:52,993
Hair.

896
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:01,543
Hey! Where are you going?

897
01:25:04,588 --> 01:25:05,839
That was close.

898
01:25:06,048 --> 01:25:08,425
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

899
01:25:08,634 --> 01:25:10,469
Go away.

900
01:25:11,011 --> 01:25:14,848
Wait till you see. It's awful.

901
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,560
Hermione?

902
01:25:18,769 --> 01:25:20,396
Are you okay?

903
01:25:22,439 --> 01:25:24,233
Do you remember me telling you...

904
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,528
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

905
01:25:27,736 --> 01:25:31,865
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

906
01:25:34,243 --> 01:25:35,786
Look at my face.

907
01:25:36,912 --> 01:25:39,331
Look at your tail.

908
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:47,381
Have you spoken to Hermione?

909
01:25:47,548 --> 01:25:50,050
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

910
01:25:50,259 --> 01:25:53,095
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

911
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:59,560
What's this?

912
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,232
Yuck!

913
01:26:05,441 --> 01:26:08,193
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

914
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:28,589
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?

915
01:26:29,006 --> 01:26:33,052
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

916
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:36,847
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

917
01:26:37,097 --> 01:26:39,933
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

918
01:26:40,142 --> 01:26:42,519
I mean, it'll just go
right through you.

919
01:26:43,604 --> 01:26:47,983
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

920
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:50,736
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

921
01:26:50,944 --> 01:26:54,406
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

922
01:26:54,948 --> 01:26:59,328
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.

923
01:26:59,703 --> 01:27:03,916
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

924
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:07,795
...and it fell through the top
of my head.

925
01:27:37,991 --> 01:27:40,452
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

926
01:28:10,357 --> 01:28:12,651
My name...

927
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:15,779
...is Harry...

928
01:28:17,406 --> 01:28:19,491
...Potter.

929
01:28:32,755 --> 01:28:37,885
Do you know anything...

930
01:28:38,761 --> 01:28:45,392
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

931
01:28:55,569 --> 01:28:57,446
Can you...

932
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:00,991
...tell me?

933
01:30:03,303 --> 01:30:06,682
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

934
01:30:10,185 --> 01:30:12,479
Are you Tom Riddle?

935
01:30:12,688 --> 01:30:14,481
Hello, can you hear me?

936
01:30:35,044 --> 01:30:36,754
Riddle!

937
01:30:37,379 --> 01:30:38,922
Come.

938
01:30:39,089 --> 01:30:41,050
Professor Dumbledore.

939
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,387
Dumbledore?

940
01:30:46,722 --> 01:30:50,184
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

941
01:30:50,392 --> 01:30:53,687
Yes, professor. I suppose I...

942
01:30:53,896 --> 01:30:56,023
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

943
01:30:56,648 --> 01:30:59,568
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

944
01:30:59,735 --> 01:31:02,571
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.

945
01:31:02,738 --> 01:31:05,574
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

946
01:31:05,741 --> 01:31:08,243
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

947
01:31:09,078 --> 01:31:11,997
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

948
01:31:12,164 --> 01:31:16,627
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...

949
01:31:18,921 --> 01:31:21,006
Is there something...

950
01:31:21,965 --> 01:31:23,926
...you wish to tell me?

951
01:31:25,177 --> 01:31:27,679
No, sir. Nothing.

952
01:31:34,478 --> 01:31:37,481
Very well, then. Off you go.

953
01:31:37,689 --> 01:31:39,566
Good night, sir.

954
01:32:15,686 --> 01:32:18,605
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.

955
01:32:18,939 --> 01:32:23,235
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone...

956
01:32:23,444 --> 01:32:25,696
You can't. You don't understand.

957
01:32:25,946 --> 01:32:29,033
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

958
01:32:29,241 --> 01:32:32,161
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

959
01:32:32,411 --> 01:32:35,497
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

960
01:32:35,873 --> 01:32:38,000
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

961
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:39,835
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

962
01:32:40,002 --> 01:32:41,962
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

963
01:32:42,129 --> 01:32:43,756
Cistem Aperio!

964
01:32:50,721 --> 01:32:53,015
Arania Exumai!

965
01:32:53,932 --> 01:32:55,392
Aragog!

966
01:32:55,559 --> 01:32:56,769
Aragog!

967
01:32:57,352 --> 01:32:58,729
I can't let you go.

968
01:32:59,271 --> 01:33:02,524
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

969
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:06,987
Hagrid!

970
01:33:37,017 --> 01:33:41,146
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

971
01:33:41,313 --> 01:33:44,233
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

972
01:33:44,441 --> 01:33:48,487
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

973
01:33:48,696 --> 01:33:52,157
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

974
01:33:52,491 --> 01:33:56,412
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

975
01:33:56,662 --> 01:33:59,331
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

976
01:33:59,498 --> 01:34:03,293
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

977
01:34:03,502 --> 01:34:06,672
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

978
01:34:07,005 --> 01:34:08,006
No.

979
01:34:12,553 --> 01:34:14,179
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

980
01:34:14,638 --> 01:34:19,143
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

981
01:34:19,351 --> 01:34:22,980
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

982
01:34:23,188 --> 01:34:26,650
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them...

983
01:34:26,859 --> 01:34:30,112
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

984
01:34:31,613 --> 01:34:34,450
In the meantime, though, you three...

985
01:34:34,658 --> 01:34:37,828
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

986
01:34:45,711 --> 01:34:47,588
Hello, Neville.

987
01:34:48,714 --> 01:34:51,175
Harry, I don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

988
01:34:51,592 --> 01:34:53,302
Come on!

989
01:35:15,866 --> 01:35:19,828
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

990
01:35:20,037 --> 01:35:22,247
Unless it wasn't a student.

991
01:35:22,456 --> 01:35:25,834
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

992
01:35:26,043 --> 01:35:27,419
And they found it.

993
01:35:28,212 --> 01:35:30,672
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

994
01:35:32,299 --> 01:35:33,550
All right, listen up.

995
01:35:33,759 --> 01:35:36,678
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

996
01:35:36,845 --> 01:35:38,722
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

997
01:35:38,889 --> 01:35:41,892
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

998
01:35:42,059 --> 01:35:45,521
...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.

999
01:35:46,772 --> 01:35:48,315
Professor McGonagall.

1000
01:35:48,482 --> 01:35:51,485
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.

1001
01:35:51,694 --> 01:35:56,615
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1002
01:35:56,824 --> 01:35:59,493
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1003
01:35:59,868 --> 01:36:02,371
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1004
01:36:04,498 --> 01:36:08,043
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1005
01:36:16,468 --> 01:36:17,636
Hermione!

1006
01:36:17,845 --> 01:36:19,638
She was found near the library...

1007
01:36:20,889 --> 01:36:22,891
...along with this.

1008
01:36:24,393 --> 01:36:27,229
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1009
01:36:27,396 --> 01:36:28,856
No.

1010
01:36:43,078 --> 01:36:45,372
Could I have your attention, please?

1011
01:36:45,581 --> 01:36:51,170
Because of recent events, these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:

1012
01:36:51,545 --> 01:36:56,633
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1013
01:36:56,842 --> 01:37:00,888
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1014
01:37:01,096 --> 01:37:04,099
No exceptions."

1015
01:37:04,767 --> 01:37:06,769
I should tell you this:

1016
01:37:06,977 --> 01:37:11,106
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1017
01:37:11,648 --> 01:37:14,818
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1018
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:29,249
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him...

1019
01:37:29,458 --> 01:37:31,710
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1020
01:37:31,919 --> 01:37:35,089
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1021
01:37:35,255 --> 01:37:36,465
But you heard McGonagall.

1022
01:37:36,673 --> 01:37:39,927
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1023
01:37:40,427 --> 01:37:42,846
I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1024
01:37:56,527 --> 01:37:58,237
Who's there?

1025
01:38:02,032 --> 01:38:03,575
Hello?

1026
01:38:04,243 --> 01:38:05,786
Hello?

1027
01:38:06,954 --> 01:38:11,250
- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting...

1028
01:38:11,417 --> 01:38:15,254
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.

1029
01:38:18,048 --> 01:38:20,300
Hagrid, are you okay?

1030
01:38:20,509 --> 01:38:23,345
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1031
01:38:24,346 --> 01:38:26,056
Did you hear about Hermione?

1032
01:38:26,557 --> 01:38:30,185
Yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1033
01:38:30,561 --> 01:38:34,189
Look, we have to ask you something.

1034
01:38:35,899 --> 01:38:39,361
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1035
01:38:41,739 --> 01:38:43,991
What you had to understand
about that is...

1036
01:38:45,701 --> 01:38:47,244
Quick, under the cloak.

1037
01:38:47,953 --> 01:38:51,040
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1038
01:38:57,463 --> 01:39:00,549
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.

1039
01:39:00,716 --> 01:39:03,093
I wonder, could we...?

1040
01:39:03,302 --> 01:39:05,763
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1041
01:39:05,971 --> 01:39:07,347
That's Dad's boss.

1042
01:39:07,514 --> 01:39:11,060
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1043
01:39:11,268 --> 01:39:15,647
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1044
01:39:15,814 --> 01:39:19,026
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1045
01:39:19,234 --> 01:39:22,404
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never...

1046
01:39:22,654 --> 01:39:24,448
You know I never, professor.

1047
01:39:24,615 --> 01:39:27,701
I want it understood, Cornelius...

1048
01:39:27,868 --> 01:39:29,661
...that Hagrid...

1049
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:32,122
...has my full confidence.

1050
01:39:32,331 --> 01:39:36,085
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1051
01:39:36,293 --> 01:39:38,796
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?

1052
01:39:39,004 --> 01:39:41,256
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1053
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:45,302
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1054
01:39:45,969 --> 01:39:47,846
Already here, Fudge?

1055
01:39:48,055 --> 01:39:49,348
Good.

1056
01:39:50,307 --> 01:39:53,060
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1057
01:39:53,727 --> 01:39:55,270
Believe me...

1058
01:39:55,562 --> 01:39:59,775
...I take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your...

1059
01:40:01,652 --> 01:40:03,821
You call this a house?

1060
01:40:04,947 --> 01:40:05,948
No.

1061
01:40:06,156 --> 01:40:09,993
I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1062
01:40:10,202 --> 01:40:14,248
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1063
01:40:14,832 --> 01:40:19,545
The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1064
01:40:21,213 --> 01:40:24,133
This is an order of suspension.

1065
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:33,016
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1066
01:40:36,937 --> 01:40:41,150
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1067
01:40:41,859 --> 01:40:44,153
Well, what, with all these attacks...

1068
01:40:44,361 --> 01:40:47,114
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1069
01:40:47,322 --> 01:40:51,869
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1070
01:40:52,036 --> 01:40:54,204
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1071
01:40:54,538 --> 01:40:57,041
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1072
01:40:57,249 --> 01:40:59,668
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1073
01:40:59,877 --> 01:41:01,503
You think so?

1074
01:41:01,712 --> 01:41:04,173
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1075
01:41:05,549 --> 01:41:08,302
If the governors desire my removal...

1076
01:41:08,469 --> 01:41:12,139
...I will, of course, step aside.

1077
01:41:13,766 --> 01:41:15,976
However...

1078
01:41:16,685 --> 01:41:21,231
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1079
01:41:21,398 --> 01:41:23,233
...to those who...

1080
01:41:23,442 --> 01:41:25,736
...ask for it.

1081
01:41:32,576 --> 01:41:34,870
Admirable sentiments.

1082
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:36,872
Shall we?

1083
01:41:49,009 --> 01:41:50,552
Fudge.

1084
01:41:52,262 --> 01:41:54,056
Come, Hagrid.

1085
01:41:55,224 --> 01:41:56,767
Well?

1086
01:41:57,434 --> 01:41:58,477
If...

1087
01:41:58,936 --> 01:42:01,438
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1088
01:42:01,647 --> 01:42:06,485
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1089
01:42:06,694 --> 01:42:09,238
Yep. That would lead them right.

1090
01:42:09,446 --> 01:42:11,365
That's all I have to say.

1091
01:42:13,117 --> 01:42:16,829
And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1092
01:42:20,249 --> 01:42:22,209
Good boy.

1093
01:42:28,382 --> 01:42:30,467
Hagrid's right.

1094
01:42:30,676 --> 01:42:33,595
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1095
01:42:33,804 --> 01:42:35,431
Look.

1096
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,313
Come on.

1097
01:42:47,026 --> 01:42:49,028
Come on, Fang.

1098
01:43:07,337 --> 01:43:08,714
Come on.

1099
01:43:08,881 --> 01:43:10,132
What?

1100
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:13,594
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."

1101
01:43:13,802 --> 01:43:16,388
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1102
01:43:18,474 --> 01:43:22,936
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?

1103
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:01,433
Harry, I don't like this.

1104
01:44:06,563 --> 01:44:09,733
- Harry, I don't like this at all.
- Shush!

1105
01:44:21,286 --> 01:44:23,789
Can we go back now?

1106
01:44:23,997 --> 01:44:25,708
Come on.

1107
01:45:15,466 --> 01:45:18,218
Who is it?

1108
01:45:18,886 --> 01:45:19,970
Don't panic.

1109
01:45:20,345 --> 01:45:21,805
Hagrid?

1110
01:45:22,264 --> 01:45:23,807
Is that you?

1111
01:45:24,433 --> 01:45:26,310
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1112
01:45:44,453 --> 01:45:47,623
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1113
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:49,541
Yes.

1114
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:53,504
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1115
01:45:53,712 --> 01:45:56,799
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1116
01:45:57,466 --> 01:45:59,259
They think it's Hagrid.

1117
01:45:59,468 --> 01:46:03,055
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1118
01:46:03,305 --> 01:46:05,599
That's a lie.

1119
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:09,019
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1120
01:46:09,645 --> 01:46:12,481
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.

1121
01:46:12,690 --> 01:46:15,693
The monster was born in the castle.

1122
01:46:15,943 --> 01:46:21,198
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1123
01:46:21,865 --> 01:46:23,492
Harry.

1124
01:46:25,411 --> 01:46:29,957
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1125
01:46:30,165 --> 01:46:33,168
We do not speak of it.

1126
01:46:33,502 --> 01:46:39,007
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1127
01:46:39,216 --> 01:46:41,009
But have you seen it?

1128
01:46:41,677 --> 01:46:47,474
I never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1129
01:46:47,683 --> 01:46:50,811
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1130
01:46:51,019 --> 01:46:55,482
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1131
01:46:55,691 --> 01:46:57,651
- Harry!
- What?

1132
01:47:10,539 --> 01:47:13,542
Well, thank you.

1133
01:47:14,501 --> 01:47:16,628
We'll just go.

1134
01:47:17,129 --> 01:47:18,839
Go?

1135
01:47:19,089 --> 01:47:20,883
I think not.

1136
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:26,472
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1137
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,058
But I cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1138
01:47:29,266 --> 01:47:33,562
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1139
01:47:33,771 --> 01:47:37,524
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1140
01:47:37,733 --> 01:47:39,526
Can we panic now?

1141
01:47:50,287 --> 01:47:52,164
Know any spells?

1142
01:47:52,373 --> 01:47:55,542
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1143
01:47:55,709 --> 01:47:58,462
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1144
01:48:11,975 --> 01:48:13,227
Let's go!

1145
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:20,442
Arania Exumai!

1146
01:48:25,781 --> 01:48:27,074
Go!

1147
01:48:45,092 --> 01:48:47,136
Glad we're out of there.

1148
01:48:54,143 --> 01:48:56,437
Arania Exumai!

1149
01:49:02,192 --> 01:49:05,904
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.

1150
01:49:16,874 --> 01:49:19,001
Get us out of here.

1151
01:49:19,543 --> 01:49:21,170
Now!

1152
01:49:23,297 --> 01:49:27,509
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1153
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:31,513
Come on! Go!

1154
01:49:49,073 --> 01:49:51,075
Get us in the air.

1155
01:49:52,201 --> 01:49:53,660
The flying gear's jammed!

1156
01:49:57,748 --> 01:50:01,502
- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!

1157
01:50:30,864 --> 01:50:33,784
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1158
01:50:33,951 --> 01:50:38,247
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.

1159
01:50:52,302 --> 01:50:55,472
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1160
01:50:55,681 --> 01:51:00,310
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.

1161
01:51:00,477 --> 01:51:03,814
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1162
01:51:04,064 --> 01:51:06,025
He was innocent.

1163
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:23,959
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1164
01:51:24,543 --> 01:51:26,795
We need you.

1165
01:51:27,755 --> 01:51:29,798
Now more than ever.

1166
01:51:46,774 --> 01:51:50,152
- What's that?
- Ron...

1167
01:51:51,028 --> 01:51:55,491
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1168
01:51:56,033 --> 01:51:57,242
Come on.

1169
01:51:57,951 --> 01:52:00,871
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1170
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:05,709
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1171
01:52:05,876 --> 01:52:09,630
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1172
01:52:09,838 --> 01:52:12,841
Spiders flee before it."
Ron, this is it.

1173
01:52:13,008 --> 01:52:15,761
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1174
01:52:15,969 --> 01:52:19,848
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

1175
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:25,479
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1176
01:52:36,156 --> 01:52:39,076
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1177
01:52:41,036 --> 01:52:43,580
Not directly, at least.

1178
01:52:44,873 --> 01:52:47,042
Colin saw it through his camera.

1179
01:52:47,251 --> 01:52:51,296
Justin... Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1180
01:52:51,463 --> 01:52:55,426
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1181
01:52:55,634 --> 01:52:58,721
And Hermione had the mirror.

1182
01:52:58,929 --> 01:53:02,266
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1183
01:53:02,474 --> 01:53:03,726
And Mrs. Norris?

1184
01:53:03,934 --> 01:53:07,396
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1185
01:53:08,981 --> 01:53:10,858
The water.

1186
01:53:11,316 --> 01:53:16,905
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1187
01:53:23,037 --> 01:53:24,913
"Spiders flee before it."

1188
01:53:25,122 --> 01:53:28,834
- It all fits.
- How's a basilisk been getting around?

1189
01:53:29,043 --> 01:53:31,879
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1190
01:53:32,046 --> 01:53:37,718
- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

1191
01:53:37,885 --> 01:53:42,097
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1192
01:53:42,306 --> 01:53:46,518
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1193
01:53:47,227 --> 01:53:48,520
Moaning Myrtle.

1194
01:53:49,521 --> 01:53:53,567
All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.

1195
01:53:53,734 --> 01:53:57,112
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.

1196
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:07,998
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1197
01:54:08,165 --> 01:54:10,334
Our worst fear has been realized.

1198
01:54:10,542 --> 01:54:15,089
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1199
01:54:16,173 --> 01:54:21,845
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1200
01:54:24,223 --> 01:54:26,642
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?

1201
01:54:26,850 --> 01:54:31,146
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1202
01:54:31,355 --> 01:54:34,274
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...

1203
01:54:34,483 --> 01:54:39,029
...that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1204
01:54:40,364 --> 01:54:45,869
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1205
01:54:46,036 --> 01:54:51,166
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.

1206
01:54:51,375 --> 01:54:54,545
I'll just be in my office getting...

1207
01:54:55,421 --> 01:54:57,381
Getting ready.

1208
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:03,470
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1209
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:05,472
Ginny Weasley.

1210
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:19,987
"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."

1211
01:55:24,033 --> 01:55:25,826
Ginny.

1212
01:55:27,911 --> 01:55:31,373
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1213
01:55:31,582 --> 01:55:34,251
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1214
01:55:35,627 --> 01:55:38,172
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1215
01:55:39,965 --> 01:55:41,925
Are you going somewhere?

1216
01:55:42,092 --> 01:55:45,179
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1217
01:55:45,387 --> 01:55:48,557
- What about my sister?
- Well...

1218
01:55:48,932 --> 01:55:52,394
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

1219
01:55:52,603 --> 01:55:56,565
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1220
01:55:56,774 --> 01:55:59,777
I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description...

1221
01:55:59,943 --> 01:56:01,070
You're running away?

1222
01:56:01,278 --> 01:56:04,031
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.

1223
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:06,742
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, use your common sense.

1224
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:11,330
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.

1225
01:56:11,955 --> 01:56:13,499
You're a fraud.

1226
01:56:13,707 --> 01:56:16,460
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1227
01:56:16,668 --> 01:56:18,629
Is there anything you can do?

1228
01:56:18,796 --> 01:56:23,467
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1229
01:56:23,675 --> 01:56:26,136
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1230
01:56:26,345 --> 01:56:29,431
I'd never have sold another book.

1231
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:35,312
In fact, I'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1232
01:56:35,854 --> 01:56:38,607
Don't even think about it.

1233
01:56:49,493 --> 01:56:50,953
Who's there?

1234
01:56:53,372 --> 01:56:55,374
Hello, Harry.

1235
01:56:56,333 --> 01:57:01,463
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.

1236
01:57:03,882 --> 01:57:06,301
It was dreadful.

1237
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:10,139
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1238
01:57:10,347 --> 01:57:14,393
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1239
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:19,440
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.

1240
01:57:19,648 --> 01:57:25,946
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- I don't know. I was distraught!

1241
01:57:27,281 --> 01:57:30,659
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1242
01:57:30,868 --> 01:57:37,166
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1243
01:57:38,375 --> 01:57:43,172
...I died.
- Just like that? How?

1244
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:47,843
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1245
01:57:48,052 --> 01:57:51,847
...over there by that sink.

1246
01:58:16,997 --> 01:58:18,999
This is it.

1247
01:58:19,917 --> 01:58:24,713
This is it, Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1248
01:58:26,757 --> 01:58:31,553
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1249
01:59:23,147 --> 01:59:27,192
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...

1250
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:29,611
There's no need for me to stay.

1251
01:59:30,279 --> 01:59:32,156
Yes, there is.

1252
01:59:33,991 --> 01:59:37,077
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?

1253
01:59:37,244 --> 01:59:38,537
Better you than us.

1254
01:59:39,788 --> 01:59:42,708
But... Obviously, yes.

1255
01:59:47,004 --> 01:59:49,673
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1256
01:59:56,513 --> 01:59:59,767
It's really quite filthy down here.

1257
02:00:00,225 --> 02:00:04,772
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?

1258
02:00:05,189 --> 02:00:10,069
If you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1259
02:00:12,654 --> 02:00:14,615
Thanks, Myrtle.

1260
02:00:43,727 --> 02:00:48,857
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1261
02:00:49,858 --> 02:00:51,485
Go on.

1262
02:00:55,239 --> 02:00:56,532
This way.

1263
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:08,794
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.

1264
02:01:09,002 --> 02:01:12,631
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.

1265
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:18,595
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1266
02:01:20,556 --> 02:01:23,475
Heart of a lion, this one.

1267
02:01:27,229 --> 02:01:31,859
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1268
02:01:33,819 --> 02:01:39,241
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.

1269
02:01:39,616 --> 02:01:43,078
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1270
02:01:43,287 --> 02:01:46,290
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1271
02:01:47,124 --> 02:01:48,584
So...

1272
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:52,004
You first, Mr. Potter.

1273
02:01:52,296 --> 02:01:55,466
Say goodbye to your memories.

1274
02:01:57,509 --> 02:01:59,470
Obliviate!

1275
02:02:33,379 --> 02:02:36,465
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1276
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:41,970
Hello.

1277
02:02:42,679 --> 02:02:44,473
Who are you?

1278
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:48,560
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?

1279
02:02:48,727 --> 02:02:51,563
And who am I?

1280
02:02:53,357 --> 02:02:57,653
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1281
02:02:58,028 --> 02:03:02,491
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1282
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:04,785
Do you live here?

1283
02:03:05,536 --> 02:03:07,996
- No.
- Really?

1284
02:03:12,626 --> 02:03:14,420
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...

1285
02:03:14,586 --> 02:03:17,506
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1286
02:03:17,715 --> 02:03:21,343
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.

1287
02:04:54,603 --> 02:04:58,440
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1288
02:04:58,982 --> 02:05:01,026
Please wake up.

1289
02:05:01,318 --> 02:05:03,445
She won't wake.

1290
02:05:08,951 --> 02:05:13,247
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1291
02:05:13,455 --> 02:05:16,792
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.

1292
02:05:17,835 --> 02:05:20,087
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...

1293
02:05:20,295 --> 02:05:22,631
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1294
02:05:25,342 --> 02:05:30,514
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1295
02:05:30,723 --> 02:05:33,100
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1296
02:05:33,308 --> 02:05:35,853
It won't come until it's called.

1297
02:05:38,689 --> 02:05:41,525
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.

1298
02:05:42,568 --> 02:05:45,946
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

1299
02:05:46,155 --> 02:05:50,200
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.

1300
02:05:51,535 --> 02:05:55,998
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1301
02:05:56,206 --> 02:05:58,500
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1302
02:05:58,709 --> 02:06:01,879
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1303
02:06:02,087 --> 02:06:04,506
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1304
02:06:04,715 --> 02:06:07,968
- But why?
- Because I told her to.

1305
02:06:08,177 --> 02:06:13,098
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1306
02:06:13,307 --> 02:06:16,643
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1307
02:06:17,186 --> 02:06:19,646
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1308
02:06:19,855 --> 02:06:22,191
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1309
02:06:22,399 --> 02:06:26,695
And then who should find it but you?

1310
02:06:26,904 --> 02:06:29,990
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.

1311
02:06:30,616 --> 02:06:32,659
And why did you want to meet me?

1312
02:06:33,077 --> 02:06:36,413
I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.

1313
02:06:36,622 --> 02:06:39,875
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1314
02:06:40,084 --> 02:06:43,253
...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.

1315
02:06:44,171 --> 02:06:48,717
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.

1316
02:06:48,926 --> 02:06:52,179
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1317
02:06:52,388 --> 02:06:54,515
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1318
02:06:54,723 --> 02:06:58,143
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1319
02:06:58,352 --> 02:07:01,605
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...

1320
02:07:01,814 --> 02:07:03,607
...so I decided to leave behind
a diary...

1321
02:07:03,816 --> 02:07:05,901
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1322
02:07:06,110 --> 02:07:08,779
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...

1323
02:07:08,946 --> 02:07:11,782
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1324
02:07:11,949 --> 02:07:14,159
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1325
02:07:14,368 --> 02:07:17,287
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1326
02:07:17,496 --> 02:07:20,249
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1327
02:07:20,624 --> 02:07:25,838
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1328
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:30,884
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1329
02:07:32,386 --> 02:07:35,931
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1330
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:38,809
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1331
02:07:39,143 --> 02:07:42,062
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1332
02:07:42,271 --> 02:07:44,606
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1333
02:07:44,815 --> 02:07:48,944
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1334
02:07:49,153 --> 02:07:55,617
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1335
02:08:16,055 --> 02:08:19,475
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1336
02:08:22,686 --> 02:08:26,231
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...

1337
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:30,903
...I was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1338
02:08:31,111 --> 02:08:35,240
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere...

1339
02:08:35,449 --> 02:08:39,661
...would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1340
02:08:39,828 --> 02:08:42,956
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1341
02:08:43,165 --> 02:08:46,502
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1342
02:08:46,752 --> 02:08:51,757
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1343
02:08:58,180 --> 02:08:59,181
Fawkes?

1344
02:09:15,489 --> 02:09:19,034
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1345
02:09:19,243 --> 02:09:22,871
A songbird and an old hat.

1346
02:09:36,218 --> 02:09:40,764
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1347
02:09:40,931 --> 02:09:44,893
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1348
02:09:58,282 --> 02:10:02,578
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.

1349
02:10:32,816 --> 02:10:34,360
No!

1350
02:10:34,818 --> 02:10:39,281
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1351
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:24,553
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1352
02:12:24,762 --> 02:12:29,641
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1353
02:12:29,850 --> 02:12:32,519
Lord Voldemort will return...

1354
02:12:32,895 --> 02:12:37,107
...very much alive.

1355
02:12:37,816 --> 02:12:39,193
Ginny?

1356
02:14:55,579 --> 02:14:57,122
Remarkable, isn't it...

1357
02:14:57,331 --> 02:15:01,293
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1358
02:15:01,502 --> 02:15:04,171
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1359
02:15:04,505 --> 02:15:08,550
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1360
02:15:13,555 --> 02:15:17,184
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1361
02:15:17,393 --> 02:15:22,398
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1362
02:15:25,275 --> 02:15:27,069
What are you doing?

1363
02:15:29,947 --> 02:15:32,032
Stop. No!

1364
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:34,303
It was me.
But I swear, I didn't mean to.

1365
02:16:34,511 --> 02:16:37,973
Riddle made me, and...

1366
02:16:38,515 --> 02:16:41,185
Harry, you're hurt.

1367
02:16:41,518 --> 02:16:42,978
Don't worry.

1368
02:16:43,187 --> 02:16:46,815
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1369
02:16:47,024 --> 02:16:50,277
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1370
02:17:02,414 --> 02:17:04,500
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1371
02:17:05,667 --> 02:17:08,045
I just wasn't quick enough.

1372
02:17:28,899 --> 02:17:30,609
Of course.

1373
02:17:30,901 --> 02:17:33,737
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1374
02:17:35,364 --> 02:17:37,157
Thanks.

1375
02:17:38,909 --> 02:17:40,994
It's all right, Ginny.

1376
02:17:42,162 --> 02:17:44,331
It's over.

1377
02:17:45,374 --> 02:17:47,876
It's just a memory.

1378
02:17:50,796 --> 02:17:56,135
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1379
02:18:07,438 --> 02:18:10,107
You both realize, of course...

1380
02:18:10,274 --> 02:18:15,779
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1381
02:18:16,405 --> 02:18:17,406
Yes, sir.

1382
02:18:17,614 --> 02:18:20,784
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1383
02:18:20,993 --> 02:18:22,161
Yes, sir.

1384
02:18:22,369 --> 02:18:25,122
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1385
02:18:26,665 --> 02:18:28,917
...that you both receive...

1386
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:33,505
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1387
02:18:35,632 --> 02:18:37,426
Thanks, sir.

1388
02:18:38,052 --> 02:18:40,304
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1389
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:44,641
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1390
02:18:45,809 --> 02:18:50,522
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1391
02:18:55,527 --> 02:18:59,823
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1392
02:19:00,491 --> 02:19:03,952
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1393
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:09,416
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1394
02:19:11,835 --> 02:19:13,379
And...

1395
02:19:13,962 --> 02:19:15,339
...second...

1396
02:19:15,547 --> 02:19:20,302
...I sense that something
is troubling you.

1397
02:19:20,552 --> 02:19:23,013
Am I right, Harry?

1398
02:19:24,890 --> 02:19:26,600
It's just...

1399
02:19:27,810 --> 02:19:32,481
You see, sir, I couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain...

1400
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:38,362
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1401
02:19:38,904 --> 02:19:40,072
I see.

1402
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:46,036
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1403
02:19:46,537 --> 02:19:52,042
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1404
02:19:53,252 --> 02:19:56,004
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...

1405
02:19:56,380 --> 02:20:00,175
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1406
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:03,303
...the night he gave you that scar.

1407
02:20:03,512 --> 02:20:07,349
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1408
02:20:09,309 --> 02:20:11,979
Not intentionally...

1409
02:20:12,896 --> 02:20:14,773
...but yes.

1410
02:20:16,734 --> 02:20:20,070
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

1411
02:20:20,237 --> 02:20:25,034
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1412
02:20:25,242 --> 02:20:28,078
Determination, resourcefulness...

1413
02:20:28,245 --> 02:20:32,207
...and if I may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1414
02:20:32,958 --> 02:20:36,920
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1415
02:20:37,796 --> 02:20:41,425
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1416
02:20:41,633 --> 02:20:43,677
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1417
02:20:43,886 --> 02:20:47,723
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1418
02:20:48,057 --> 02:20:50,142
It is our choices.

1419
02:20:53,854 --> 02:20:57,232
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1420
02:20:57,441 --> 02:21:02,279
...then I suggest
you look more closely at this.

1421
02:21:03,322 --> 02:21:04,948
Be careful.

1422
02:21:10,662 --> 02:21:13,332
Godric Gryffindor.

1423
02:21:13,499 --> 02:21:17,544
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1424
02:21:26,470 --> 02:21:27,846
Dobby.

1425
02:21:29,139 --> 02:21:33,519
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1426
02:21:35,688 --> 02:21:38,982
I'll deal with you later.

1427
02:21:44,863 --> 02:21:46,490
Out of my way, Potter.

1428
02:21:46,657 --> 02:21:50,202
So it's true. You have returned.

1429
02:21:50,911 --> 02:21:53,664
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1430
02:21:53,872 --> 02:21:58,001
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1431
02:21:58,877 --> 02:22:02,923
- Ridiculous.
- Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1432
02:22:03,132 --> 02:22:06,760
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1433
02:22:06,969 --> 02:22:09,805
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1434
02:22:10,264 --> 02:22:13,684
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?

1435
02:22:13,892 --> 02:22:17,646
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1436
02:22:17,855 --> 02:22:20,691
...the welfare of this school...

1437
02:22:20,858 --> 02:22:25,154
...and, of course, its students.

1438
02:22:29,199 --> 02:22:33,412
The culprit has been identified,
I presume?

1439
02:22:33,787 --> 02:22:35,330
Yes.

1440
02:22:36,915 --> 02:22:38,709
And?

1441
02:22:39,918 --> 02:22:41,920
Who was it?

1442
02:22:48,385 --> 02:22:50,888
Voldemort.

1443
02:22:52,097 --> 02:22:57,519
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1444
02:22:58,103 --> 02:23:01,690
...by means of this.

1445
02:23:04,401 --> 02:23:05,944
I see.

1446
02:23:07,404 --> 02:23:11,617
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1447
02:23:11,950 --> 02:23:15,579
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1448
02:23:15,788 --> 02:23:19,041
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1449
02:23:19,375 --> 02:23:23,253
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1450
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:25,506
...severe.

1451
02:23:26,965 --> 02:23:29,718
Well, let us hope...

1452
02:23:29,927 --> 02:23:35,432
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1453
02:23:36,225 --> 02:23:39,937
Don't worry. I will be.

1454
02:23:48,737 --> 02:23:50,739
Dumbledore.

1455
02:23:51,907 --> 02:23:55,411
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1456
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:17,182
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

1457
02:24:23,605 --> 02:24:25,149
Mr. Malfoy.

1458
02:24:25,357 --> 02:24:27,526
Mr. Malfoy!

1459
02:24:28,027 --> 02:24:30,154
I have something of yours.

1460
02:24:31,864 --> 02:24:34,783
Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1461
02:24:34,992 --> 02:24:36,535
I think you do, sir.

1462
02:24:36,702 --> 02:24:39,788
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1463
02:24:39,997 --> 02:24:41,373
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1464
02:24:42,124 --> 02:24:44,626
You do, do you?

1465
02:24:52,009 --> 02:24:55,095
Why don't you prove it?

1466
02:25:01,352 --> 02:25:03,479
Come, Dobby.

1467
02:25:04,813 --> 02:25:06,815
Open it.

1468
02:25:10,361 --> 02:25:11,904
Dobby.

1469
02:25:12,071 --> 02:25:15,199
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1470
02:25:15,532 --> 02:25:17,576
What? I didn't give...

1471
02:25:17,785 --> 02:25:21,455
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1472
02:25:21,663 --> 02:25:24,666
Dobby is free.

1473
02:25:31,256 --> 02:25:34,968
You lost me my servant!

1474
02:25:41,975 --> 02:25:45,938
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1475
02:25:58,117 --> 02:26:01,787
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1476
02:26:01,995 --> 02:26:05,165
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1477
02:26:05,332 --> 02:26:10,504
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1478
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:22,099
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1479
02:26:22,516 --> 02:26:26,729
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1480
02:26:28,731 --> 02:26:31,150
Never try to save my life again.

1481
02:26:37,322 --> 02:26:40,325
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1482
02:26:40,617 --> 02:26:42,953
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

1483
02:26:43,162 --> 02:26:46,081
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1484
02:26:47,458 --> 02:26:49,626
Hello.

1485
02:26:51,378 --> 02:26:56,008
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1486
02:26:59,261 --> 02:27:02,556
Harry. It's Hermione.

1487
02:27:29,416 --> 02:27:33,087
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

1488
02:27:33,295 --> 02:27:35,839
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1489
02:27:36,048 --> 02:27:38,258
We had loads of help from you.

1490
02:27:38,467 --> 02:27:41,637
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

1491
02:27:43,514 --> 02:27:46,433
Could I have your attention, please?

1492
02:27:50,646 --> 02:27:53,107
Before we begin the feast...

1493
02:27:53,315 --> 02:27:59,530
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1494
02:27:59,738 --> 02:28:03,867
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1495
02:28:04,034 --> 02:28:06,704
...to all who had been Petrified.

1496
02:28:17,214 --> 02:28:20,217
Also, in light of the recent events...

1497
02:28:20,384 --> 02:28:22,511
...as a school treat...

1498
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:26,640
...all exams have been canceled.

1499
02:28:29,351 --> 02:28:30,894
Oh, no.

1500
02:28:47,870 --> 02:28:49,872
Sorry I'm late.

1501
02:28:55,961 --> 02:29:00,341
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1502
02:29:00,716 --> 02:29:03,969
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1503
02:29:19,777 --> 02:29:25,783
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...

1504
02:29:25,991 --> 02:29:28,911
...and Hermione, of course...

1505
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:33,665
...I would still be you-know-where...

1506
02:29:33,874 --> 02:29:37,419
...so I'd just like to say thanks.

1507
02:29:46,845 --> 02:29:49,765
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
