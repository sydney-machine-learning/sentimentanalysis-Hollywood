1
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,496
Towels.

2
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,062
Lord Miraz?

3
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,560
You have a son.

4
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,535
The heavens have blessed us.

5
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,543
You know your orders.

6
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,084
General Glozelle?

7
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,220
Yes, my lord.

8
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,053
Five more minutes.

9
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,995
Won't be watching
the stars tonight, my prince.

10
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,055
Come. We must hurry.

11
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,433
- Professor, what's going on?
- Your aunt has given birth...

12
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,971
...to a son.

13
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,644
Come.

14
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,527
You must make for the woods.

15
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,967
- The woods?
- They won't follow you there.

16
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,735
It has taken me
many years to find this.

17
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,938
Do not use it except
at your greatest need.

18
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,210
Will I ever see you again?

19
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,275
I dearly hope so, my prince.

20
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:17,187
There is so much more
I meant to tell you.

21
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,920
Everything you know
is about to change.

22
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,053
Close the drawbridge!

23
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,163
Now, go.

24
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,166
- Halt!
- Halt!

25
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,287
A son! A son!

26
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:55,920
Lady Prunaprismia has this night
given Lord Miraz a son!

27
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,874
Which of you superstitious old women
wants to spend the night in a cell?

28
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,708
He's seen us.

29
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,400
Take care of him.

30
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,066
No!

31
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,442
- Mind yourself, love.
- I'm sorry.

32
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,248
Watch where you're going!

33
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,981
Wait for me!

34
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,726
You go to Saint Finbar's?

35
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:58,998
That's right.

36
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,439
I go to Hendon House.
Across the road.

37
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,043
I've seen you...

38
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,080
...sitting by yourself.

39
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:14,212
Yes, well, I prefer to be left alone.

40
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,157
Me, too.

41
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,287
What's your name?

42
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,693
- Phyllis.
- Susan!

43
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,025
You'd better come quickly.

44
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,430
Paper here!

45
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,170
Get your daily paper!

46
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,039
Edmund!

47
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,576
Go on! Kick him in the face!

48
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,162
Stop it. Break it up.
That's enough. Come on.

49
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,368
That's it. Get up.

50
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,733
Act your age!

51
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,448
- You're welcome.
- I had it sorted.

52
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,579
What was it this time?

53
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,150
- He bumped me.
- So you hit him?

54
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:04,663
No. After he bumped me,
they tried to make me apologize.

55
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,460
- That's when I hit him.
- Really?

56
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,660
- Is it that hard just to walk away?
- I shouldn't have to.

57
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,899
I mean, don't you ever get tired
of being treated like a kid?

58
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,530
We are kids.

59
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,472
Well, I wasn't always.

60
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,572
It's been a year.

61
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,073
How long does he expect us to wait?

62
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,777
I think it's time to accept
that we live here.

63
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,286
It's no use pretending any different.

64
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,591
Oh, no.

65
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,457
- Pretend you're talking to me.
- We are talking to you.

66
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,524
- Quiet, Lu.
- Something pinched me!

67
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,126
- Stop pulling!
- Not touching you.

68
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,469
Look, would all of you just...
What is that?

69
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,906
- It feels like magic.
- Everyone hold hands.

70
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,967
- I'm not holding your hand!
- Just...

71
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,478
Shame you're not as quick as me, Ed!

72
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,879
Last one in's a rotten egg.

73
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,075
Watch out!

74
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,413
Here it comes!

75
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,423
Wait a minute!

76
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,896
Come on, Susan. Hurry up!

77
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,501
Come on, it's lovely.

78
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,105
Edmund.

79
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,709
Ed? Ed!

80
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,879
- What is it?
- Where do you suppose we are?

81
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,820
Well, where do you think?

82
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,757
Well, I don't remember
any ruins in Narnia.

83
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,775
Wonder who lived here.

84
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,514
I think we did.

85
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,423
Hey, that's mine.

86
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,935
- From my chess set.
- Which chess set?

87
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,439
I didn't exactly have a solid gold
chess set in Finchley, did I?

88
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,479
Can't be.

89
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,819
- Don't you see?
- What?

90
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,056
Imagine walls.

91
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,690
And columns, there.

92
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,636
And a glass roof.

93
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,604
Cair Paravel.

94
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,510
Wait. Wait, my lord.
It is not what you think.

95
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,851
Then what is it?

96
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,753
We're not exactly sure.

97
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,030
Impossible.

98
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,978
I warned this council when it
put its trust in Lord Miraz...

99
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,571
...there would be consequences.
- No.

100
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,516
We can't accuse
the Lord Protector without proof.

101
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:02,680
How long are we going
to hide behind that excuse?

102
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,952
Until every chair
in this chamber is empty?

103
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,226
Lords of the council,
my apologies for being late.

104
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,027
I wasn't aware we were in session.

105
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,191
No doubt you were otherwise occupied.

106
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,396
My lord?

107
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,303
Ever since the death
of Caspian the ninth,

108
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,779
you've behaved
as if you were king.

109
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:33,046
Now it seems that from behind his walls
even Prince Caspian has gone missing.

110
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,045
My deepest condolences, Lord Miraz.

111
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,754
Imagine, losing your nephew,

112
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,261
the rightful heir to the throne,

113
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,890
on the very night your wife
has blessed you with a son.

114
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,668
Thank you, Lord Sopespian.

115
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,069
Your compassion is a boon
in this troubled time.

116
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,837
I trust you can tell us how such
a tragedy could have occurred.

117
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,810
That is the most
disturbing news of all.

118
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:16,256
Our beloved Caspian was abducted...

119
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,724
...by Narnians.

120
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,759
You go too far, Miraz.

121
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:29,501
Expect us to stand by while you blame
such a blatant crime on fairy tales?

122
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,477
What?

123
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:44,389
We forget, my lords,
Narnia was once a savage land.

124
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,717
Fierce creatures roamed free.

125
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:52,758
Much of our forefathers' blood was shed

126
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,392
to exterminate this vermin.

127
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,740
Or so we thought.

128
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,807
But while we've been bickering
amongst ourselves...

129
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:14,149
...they've been breeding
like cockroaches under a rock!

130
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,917
Growing stronger. Watching us.

131
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,953
Waiting to strike!

132
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:31,436
And you wonder why we don't like you.

133
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,534
Well, I intend to strike back.

134
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,413
Even if I have to cut down
the entire forest,

135
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,474
I assure you,
I will find Prince Caspian

136
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:50,716
and finish what our ancestors began.

137
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,840
- Catapults.
- What?

138
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:16,308
This didn't just happen.
Cair Paravel was attacked.

139
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,056
Don't suppose you have
any matches, do you?

140
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,399
No, but...

141
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,993
...would this help?

142
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,904
You might have mentioned that
a bit sooner.

143
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,815
I can't believe it.
It's all still here.

144
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,892
I was so tall.

145
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,993
Well, you were older then.

146
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,871
As opposed to hundreds of years
later... when you're younger.

147
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,186
- What is it?
- My horn.

148
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,716
I must've left it on my saddle
the day we went back.

149
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,808
When Aslan bares his teeth,
winter meets its death.

150
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,286
When he shakes his mane...

151
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,887
...we shall have spring again.

152
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:24,235
Everyone we knew...
Mr. Tumnus and the Beavers...

153
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,234
...they're all gone.

154
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:38,038
I think it's time we found out
what's going on.

155
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,124
He won't stop staring.

156
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,164
So don't look.

157
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,175
Here's far enough.

158
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:20,819
Drop him!

159
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,225
Crows and crockery!

160
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,596
"Drop him"!

161
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,700
That's the best
you can come up with?

162
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,871
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

163
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,848
They were doing fine
drowning me without your help.

164
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,646
Maybe we should have let them.

165
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,814
Why were they trying
to kill you, anyway?

166
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,425
They're Telmarines.
That's what they do.

167
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:30,690
Telmarines? In Narnia?

168
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,891
Where have you been
for the last few hundred years?

169
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,527
It's a bit of a long story.

170
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,912
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

171
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,242
You're it?

172
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:55,253
You're the kings and queens of old?

173
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,081
High King Peter, the Magnificent.

174
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,325
You probably could've
left off the last bit.

175
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:05,396
Probably.

176
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,796
You might be surprised.

177
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,771
You don't want to do that, boy.

178
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,864
Not me. Him.

179
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,653
Edmund!

180
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,525
You all right?

181
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,441
Beards and bedsteads!

182
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:02,351
Maybe that horn worked after all.

183
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,484
What horn?

184
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:27,143
This bread is so stale.

185
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,670
I'll just get him some soup.
He should be coming around soon.

186
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,013
I don't think
I hit him hard enough.

187
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,780
Nikabrik, he's just a boy.

188
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:39,256
He's a Telmarine, not some lost puppy.
You said you were gonna get rid of him.

189
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,816
No. I said I'd take care of him.

190
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:46,228
We can't kill him now.
I just bandaged his head.

191
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:49,233
It would be like murdering a guest.

192
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,667
How do you think his friends
are treating their guest?

193
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:55,298
Trumpkin knew what he was doing.
It's not the boy's fault.

194
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,211
Stop! Stop!

195
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:04,006
Hold it. No, no!

196
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:07,109
I told you we should have killed him
when we had the chance.

197
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,451
- You know why we can't.
- If we're taking a vote, I'm with him.

198
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,616
We can't let him go. He's seen us.

199
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,249
That's enough, Nikabrik!

200
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,487
Or do I have to sit on your head again?

201
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,826
And you. Look what you made me do.

202
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,166
I spent half the morning on that soup.

203
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,366
What are you?

204
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,738
You know, it's funny
that you would ask that.

205
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,243
You think people would know
a badger when they saw one.

206
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,836
No. No, I mean...

207
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,613
...you're Narnians.
You're supposed to be extinct.

208
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,943
Sorry to disappoint you.

209
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,691
Here you go. Still hot.

210
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,252
Since when did we open a boarding house
for Telmarine soldiers?

211
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:53,593
I'm not a soldier.

212
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:58,331
I am Prince Caspian. The tenth.

213
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,465
What are you doing here?

214
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,199
Running away.

215
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,109
My uncle has always wanted my throne.

216
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,411
I suppose I have only lived this long

217
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,117
because he did not have
an heir of his own.

218
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:27,090
- Well, that changes things.
- Yeah.

219
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,430
Means we don't have
to kill you ourselves.

220
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,799
You're right.

221
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,033
- Where are you going?
- My uncle won't stop until I am dead.

222
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,704
But you can't leave.
You're meant to save us.

223
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:44,314
Don't you know what this is?

224
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,170
You have quite a library, doctor.

225
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:21,118
Is there anything particular
you seek, my lord?

226
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,678
I think I've already found
what I'm looking for...

227
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,556
...in one of my soldiers!

228
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,476
What do you know
of Queen Susan's horn?

229
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,879
It was said to be magic.

230
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,614
Magic?

231
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:01,751
The Narnians believed it could summon
their kings and queens of old.

232
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:05,895
At least, such was the superstition.

233
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:13,036
And what does Caspian
know of this superstition?

234
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:18,270
My lord, you forbade me
from mentioning the old tales.

235
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,406
So I did.

236
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:34,219
I will say this. If Caspian
does know of the Deep Magic,

237
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,626
my lord would have
good reason to be nervous.

238
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,342
First our prince...

239
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,772
...now his tutor.

240
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,045
If the members of Miraz's
own house are not safe,

241
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,451
- are any of us?
- Lord Sopespian!

242
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,491
Those are dangerous words,
Lord Sopespian.

243
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,323
But these are
dangerous times, general.

244
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:14,389
One should choose his words
as carefully as he chooses his friends.

245
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,535
How long until the bridge is finished?

246
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,065
- Construction continues on schedule.
- That's not good enough.

247
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,442
I need my army across that river now.

248
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:31,641
May I suggest you contribute
some of your own men?

249
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,912
I've only so many at my disposal.

250
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,455
A fact you'd be wise to remember.

251
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,182
Go to Beruna.

252
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:45,593
Take as many troops as you need.
We must get to Caspian before they do.

253
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,229
"They," my lord?

254
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,064
It's time you learned your history.

255
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,360
They're so still.

256
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,137
They're trees. What'd you expect?

257
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,970
They used to dance.

258
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,071
Wasn't long after you left
that the Telmarines invaded.

259
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,010
Those who survived
retreated to the woods.

260
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,554
And the trees,

261
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:48,286
they retreated so deep into themselves
that they haven't been heard from since.

262
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,387
I don't understand.
How could Aslan have let this happen?

263
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,761
Aslan?

264
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:57,128
Thought he abandoned us
when you lot did.

265
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,233
We didn't mean to leave, you know.

266
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,977
Makes no difference now, does it?

267
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,480
Get us to the Narnians...

268
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,583
...and it will.

269
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,450
Hello, there.

270
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:59,430
It's all right. We're friends.

271
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,337
Don't move, Your Majesty.

272
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,347
Stay away from her!

273
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,084
Shoot, Susan! Shoot!

274
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,930
- Why wouldn't he stop?
- I suspect he was hungry.

275
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:55,946
Thanks.

276
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:00,649
He was wild.

277
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,454
I don't think he could talk at all.

278
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,360
Get treated like
a dumb animal long enough,

279
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,367
that's what you become.

280
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,904
You may find Narnia a more savage place
than you remember.

281
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,087
I can hear you.

282
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:42,060
I just think we should wait
for the kings and queens.

283
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:47,066
Fine! Go then! See if the others
will be as understanding!

284
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,628
Or maybe I'll come with you.

285
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,335
I want to see you
explain things to the minotaurs.

286
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,138
Minotaurs?

287
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,707
They're real?

288
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,271
And very bad-tempered.

289
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,683
- Yeah, not to mention big.
- Huge.

290
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,922
What about centaurs?
Do they still exist?

291
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:08,960
Well, the centaurs will
probably fight on your side.

292
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:12,087
But there's no telling
what the others will do.

293
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,556
What about Aslan?

294
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,563
How do you know so much about us?

295
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:26,338
- Stories.
- Wait a minute.

296
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,073
Your father told you
stories about Narnia?

297
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,575
No, my professor, he...

298
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:34,944
Listen, I'm sorry.

299
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,820
These are not the kind of questions
you should be asking.

300
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,589
- What is it?
- Human.

301
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:46,324
- Him?
- No. Them.

302
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,063
- There they are!
- Run!

303
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:05,982
Now!

304
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,654
- Oh, no.
- Wait. I'll go.

305
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,199
Take it. Go!
It's more important than I am.

306
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:01,405
Get him out of here.

307
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,178
Where are you?

308
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:33,002
Choose your last words
carefully, Telmarine.

309
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,700
You are a mouse.

310
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,305
I was hoping for something
a little more original.

311
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,743
Pick up your sword.

312
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,547
No, thanks.

313
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,884
Pick it up! I will not fight
an unarmed man.

314
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,013
Which is why I might live longer

315
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,923
if I choose not to cross blades
with you, noble mouse.

316
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:58,520
I said I would not fight you.
I didn't say I'd let you live!

317
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,258
Reepicheep!

318
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,458
- Stay your blade!
- Trufflehunter?

319
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:06,595
I trust you have a very good reason
for this untimely interruption.

320
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:10,107
- He doesn't. Go ahead.
- He's the one who blew the horn.

321
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,170
- What?
- Then let him bring it forward.

322
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:21,615
This is the reason we have gathered.

323
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:28,587
I don't remember this way.

324
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,891
That's the problem with girls.
You can't carry a map in your heads.

325
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:35,091
That's because our heads
have something in them.

326
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,761
I wish he'd just listen
to the D.L.F. in the first place.

327
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:41,965
- D.L. F?
- Dear Little Friend.

328
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,704
Oh, that's not at all
patronizing, is it?

329
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,009
I'm not lost.

330
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,175
No.

331
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,312
You're just going the wrong way.

332
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,856
You last saw Caspian
at the Shuddering Woods,

333
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,893
and the quickest way there
is to cross at the river Rush.

334
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,328
But unless I'm mistaken,
there's no crossing in these parts.

335
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,423
That explains it, then.
You're mistaken.

336
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:36,159
You see, over time, water erodes
the earth's soil, carving deeper...

337
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,888
Oh, shut up.

338
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:41,193
- Is there a way down?
- Yeah, falling.

339
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,201
Well, we weren't lost.

340
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:47,432
There's a ford near Beruna.
How do you feel about swimming?

341
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,530
I'd rather that than walking.

342
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,275
Aslan?

343
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,711
It's Aslan!
It's Aslan over there!

344
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,246
Don't you see? He's right...

345
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:03,649
...there.

346
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,685
Do you see him now?

347
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:09,757
I'm not crazy.

348
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,591
He was there.
He wanted us to follow him.

349
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,669
I'm sure there are any number
of lions in this wood.

350
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,796
- Just like that bear.
- I think I know Aslan when I see him.

351
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,701
Look, I'm not about
to jump off a cliff

352
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,938
after someone who doesn't exist.

353
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,412
The last time I didn't believe Lucy

354
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,915
I ended up looking pretty stupid.

355
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:40,654
Why wouldn't I have seen him?

356
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,057
Maybe you weren't looking.

357
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,358
I'm sorry, Lu.

358
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:14,651
Kill him!

359
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:16,421
- Telmarine!
- Liar!

360
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:18,822
Murderer!

361
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,127
All this horn proves is they've stolen
yet another thing from us!

362
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,101
- I didn't steal anything.
- Didn't steal anything?

363
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,002
Shall we list the things
the Telmarines have taken?

364
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,699
- Our homes!
- Our land!

365
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,072
- Our freedom!
- Our lives!

366
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,303
You stole Narnia!

367
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:36,677
You would hold me accountable
for all the crimes of my people?

368
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:38,147
Accountable...

369
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,607
...and punishable.

370
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:44,119
That is rich coming from you, dwarf.

371
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:48,249
Have you forgotten it was your people
who fought alongside the White Witch?

372
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:52,126
And I'd gladly do it again,
if it would rid us of these barbarians.

373
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,688
Then it's lucky that it is not
in your power to bring her back.

374
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,259
Or are you suggesting that we ask
this boy to go against Aslan now?

375
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:07,237
Some of you may have forgotten,
but we badgers remember well,

376
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:12,010
that Narnia was never right
except when a Son of Adam was king.

377
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:15,018
He's a Telmarine!
Why would we want him as our king?

378
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:16,951
Because I can help you.

379
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,819
- It's a trick!
- At least hear him out!

380
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:23,486
Beyond these woods, I'm a prince.

381
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:27,160
The Telmarine throne
is rightfully mine!

382
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:31,497
Help me claim it,
and I can bring peace between us.

383
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:36,773
It is true. The time is ripe.

384
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,207
I watch the skies,

385
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:44,874
for it is mine to watch
as it is yours to remember, badger.

386
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:51,478
Tarva, the lord of victory,
and Alambil, the lady of peace,

387
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:54,582
have come together
in the high heavens.

388
00:44:55,827 --> 00:45:00,321
And now here,
a Son of Adam has come forth...

389
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,634
...to offer us back our freedom.

390
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,865
Is this possible? Do you really
think there could be peace?

391
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:10,601
Do you? I mean, really?

392
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:15,771
Two days ago, I didn't believe
in the existence of talking animals...

393
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:18,611
...or dwarves... or centaurs.

394
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,415
Yet here you are
in strength and numbers

395
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:26,548
that we Telmarines
could never have imagined.

396
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:31,993
Whether this horn is magic or not,
it brought us together.

397
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,798
And together,

398
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:37,562
we have a chance
to take back what is ours.

399
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:44,105
If you will lead us,
then my sons and I...

400
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,005
...offer you our swords.

401
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,723
And we offer you our lives,
unreservedly.

402
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:07,160
Miraz's army will not
be far behind us, sire.

403
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:12,259
If we are to be ready for them, we need
to hurry to find soldiers and weapons.

404
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,601
I'm sure they will be here soon.

405
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:32,112
These ones!
And these ones!

406
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,386
Timber!

407
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:40,690
- Get back!
- Watch your back!

408
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:43,590
Look out!

409
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,994
- Steady, steady!
- Timber!

410
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:08,517
Perhaps this wasn't the best way
to come after all.

411
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,884
So where exactly
do you think you saw Aslan?

412
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,588
I wish you'd all stop trying
to sound like grown-ups.

413
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,928
I don't think I saw him,
I did see him.

414
00:47:49,635 --> 00:47:51,796
I am a grown-up.

415
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,798
It was right over...

416
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,601
Lucy!

417
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,974
...here.

418
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:55,322
Lucy, are you awake?

419
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,399
Why do you think I didn't see Aslan?

420
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,571
You believe me?

421
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,582
Well, we got across the gorge.

422
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,311
I don't know.

423
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,748
Maybe you didn't really want to.

424
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:29,431
You always knew we'd be
coming back here, didn't you?

425
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:31,797
I hoped so.

426
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:40,734
I finally just got used
to the idea of being in England.

427
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,211
But you're happy
to be here, aren't you?

428
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:47,243
While it lasts.

429
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,172
Lucy.

430
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,281
Lucy.

431
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,917
Aslan!

432
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,766
I've missed you so much!

433
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,902
- You've grown.
- Every year you grow...

434
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,004
...so shall I.

435
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:37,183
Where have you been?
Why haven't you come to help us?

436
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:41,415
Things never happen
the same way twice, dear one.

437
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,265
Susan! Wake up!

438
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:57,267
Certainly, Lu.
Whatever you like.

439
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:21,626
Wake up.

440
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,415
Aslan?

441
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:19,689
No, stop!

442
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,813
Prince Caspian?

443
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:46,509
Yes? And who are you?

444
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,574
Peter!

445
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,659
- High King Peter.
- I believe you called.

446
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:05,190
Well, yes, but...
I thought you'd be older.

447
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:08,833
If you like, we could
come back in a few years...

448
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:12,869
No. No, that's all right.
You're just...

449
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:15,878
You're not exactly what I expected.

450
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,209
Neither are you.

451
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:24,485
A common enemy unites
even the oldest of foes.

452
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:28,821
We have anxiously awaited
your return, my liege.

453
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,190
Our hearts and swords
are at your service.

454
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,058
Oh, my gosh, he is so cute.

455
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,531
- Who said that?
- Sorry.

456
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:41,435
Your Majesty, with the greatest respect,

457
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,997
I do believe "courageous,"
"courteous," or "chivalrous"

458
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,270
might more befit a knight of Narnia.

459
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,507
Well, at least we know some of you
can handle a blade.

460
00:55:50,582 --> 00:55:53,608
Yes, indeed. And I have
recently put it to good use,

461
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,742
securing weapons for your army, sire.

462
00:55:55,819 --> 00:56:00,085
Good. Because we're going
to need every sword we can get.

463
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:03,649
Well, then, you will probably
be wanting yours back.

464
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:26,239
How much did they take?

465
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,784
Enough weapons and armor
for two regiments.

466
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:32,219
But... there's more.

467
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38,652
"You were right to fear the woods."

468
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:43,393
- "X"?
- Caspian. The tenth.

469
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:47,164
I apologize, my lord.
The blame is mine.

470
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,795
I know.

471
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:51,974
Tell me, general...

472
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,408
...how many men did you lose?

473
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:59,142
- None, my lord.
- None?

474
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:04,381
They came like ghosts,
in the dead of night. We never saw them.

475
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:09,056
Then how do you explain your injuries?

476
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:20,432
I asked...

477
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:22,768
...how many men were killed

478
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,606
during this bloody Narnian attack?

479
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:32,378
Of which you were a fortunate survivor.

480
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:36,843
General...

481
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,551
...how many?

482
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:56,172
Three.

483
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:07,179
I apologize, Lord Sopespian.

484
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:13,145
Caspian is not a victim
of this savage uprising.

485
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,781
He is the instigator.

486
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,127
It seems Narnia is in need
of a new king.

487
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,602
Well, it's good you have troops,

488
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:38,375
but we need some fortifications.
Somewhere to train.

489
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:45,615
So? What are they like?

490
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:50,888
Malcontents, complainers,
stubborn as mules in the morning.

491
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,895
So you like them, then.

492
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,995
Well enough.

493
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:19,214
It may not be what you are used to,
but it is defensible.

494
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,149
Peter. You may want to see this.

495
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,660
It's us.

496
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,098
What is this place?

497
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,136
You don't know?

498
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,940
He must know what he's doing.

499
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,983
I think it's up to us now.

500
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:10,452
It's only a matter of time.

501
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,456
Miraz's men and war machines
are on their way.

502
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:18,351
That means those same men
aren't protecting his castle.

503
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,157
What do you propose we do,
Your Majesty?

504
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,858
- We need to get ready for it.
- To start planning for...

505
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:31,204
Our only hope is to strike them
before they strike us.

506
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,071
Crazy. No one has taken that castle.

507
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:36,670
- There's always a first time.
- We'll have the element of surprise.

508
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:39,647
- But we have the advantage here!
- If we dig in,

509
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:42,617
we could probably
hold them off indefinitely.

510
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:47,356
I, for one, feel safer underground.

511
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:50,552
Look. I appreciate
what you've done here,

512
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:53,187
but this isn't a fortress. It's a tomb.

513
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:54,821
Yes. And if they're smart,

514
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:57,765
the Telmarines will just wait
and starve us out.

515
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:01,702
- We could collect nuts!
- Yes! And throw them at the Telmarines.

516
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,898
Shut up!

517
01:04:03,974 --> 01:04:05,942
I think you know where I stand, sire.

518
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:14,615
If I get your troops in,
can you handle the guards?

519
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:22,186
Or die trying, my liege.

520
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:26,161
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Sorry?

521
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,899
You're all acting like
there's only two options.

522
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,492
Dying here, or dying there.

523
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:37,370
- I'm not sure you've been listening.
- No, you're not listening.

524
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,705
Or have you forgotten who really
defeated the White Witch, Peter?

525
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,977
I think we've waited
for Aslan long enough.

526
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:41,839
Professor?

527
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,641
- I have to find him.
- You don't have time.

528
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:12,613
- You need to get the gate open.
- You wouldn't be here without him.

529
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:14,115
And neither would I.

530
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:20,018
You and I can deal with Miraz.

531
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,250
And I can still get
to the gate in time.

532
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,909
Yes, I'm a mouse.

533
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,870
We were expecting someone,
you know, taller.

534
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:17,572
- You're one to talk.
- Is that supposed to be irony?

535
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,113
Five more minutes?

536
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,952
What are you doing here?

537
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:37,329
I didn't help you escape
just so you could break back in.

538
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,895
You have to get out

539
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,437
before Miraz learns you're here.

540
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:44,336
He's going to learn soon enough.

541
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:46,968
We are giving him your cell.

542
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:52,306
Don't underestimate Miraz
as your father did.

543
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,941
What are you talking about?

544
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,118
I'm sorry.

545
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,809
Thank goodness you're safe.

546
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:22,174
Get up.

547
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,346
- Caspian?
- Stay where you are.

548
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:32,946
- What are you doing?
- I should think it's obvious, dear.

549
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:37,049
You know, some families might
consider this inappropriate behavior.

550
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,321
That doesn't seem to have stopped you!

551
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,556
But you are not like me, are you?

552
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:47,233
It's sad. The first time
you've shown any backbone...

553
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,736
...and it's such a waste.

554
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,807
Put the sword down, Caspian.

555
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:59,771
- I don't want to do this.
- We don't want you to either.

556
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,514
This used to be a private room.

557
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:09,854
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be in the gatehouse!

558
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,052
No!

559
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:14,928
Tonight for once, I want the truth.

560
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:18,430
Did you kill my father?

561
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:24,902
Now we get to it.

562
01:12:25,743 --> 01:12:28,109
You said your brother died in his sleep.

563
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,111
That was more or less true.

564
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:33,342
Caspian, this won't
make things any better.

565
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:36,442
We Telmarines would have
nothing had we not taken it.

566
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,749
Your father knew that
as well as anyone.

567
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,213
How could you?

568
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,781
For the same reason
you will pull that trigger.

569
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:46,962
- For our son.
- Stop!

570
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,862
- Stay right there.
- You need to make a choice, dear.

571
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,264
Do you want our child to be king?

572
01:12:52,335 --> 01:12:55,304
Or do you want him
to be like Caspian here?

573
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:01,034
- Fatherless!
- No!

574
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,078
Caspian!

575
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,372
What's that supposed to mean?

576
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:40,941
- We're under attack!
- Sound the alarm!

577
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:43,952
Men! Grab your bows!

578
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:51,519
- Peter!
- Our troops are just outside! Come on!

579
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:57,697
Now, Ed! Now!

580
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,235
- Signal the troops!
- I'm a bit busy, Pete!

581
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:26,224
Peter! It's too late.
We have to call it off while we can.

582
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,092
No, I can still do this!

583
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,160
Help me!

584
01:14:48,718 --> 01:14:52,210
Exactly who are you
doing this for, Peter?

585
01:14:57,393 --> 01:14:58,621
Come on!

586
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:10,134
Charge!

587
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,613
We're under attack!

588
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,817
Attack! Attack!

589
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,602
For Narnia!

590
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:27,377
Archers!

591
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:30,652
Pick a target!

592
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,213
Take aim!

593
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:43,821
Ed!

594
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,823
Get that gate closed.

595
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:42,882
Fall back!

596
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,153
We need to retreat! Now!

597
01:18:53,696 --> 01:18:55,857
Go! Get her out of here!

598
01:18:56,632 --> 01:18:59,226
Back to the gate! Go!

599
01:19:04,874 --> 01:19:08,401
- Caspian!
- I'll find him!

600
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:12,538
Go! Get out! Go!
Get out! Retreat!

601
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:19,215
Follow me!

602
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:55,286
Give the order.

603
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,393
My men are still down there.

604
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,692
Draw back!
Get out! Retreat!

605
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:07,693
Now!

606
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,267
Fire!

607
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:38,961
Run for your life!
Save yourself!

608
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:55,114
Peter! The bridge!

609
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,933
Leave us! Go, brothers!

610
01:21:14,003 --> 01:21:17,063
In the name of Aslan!

611
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:17,196
What happened?

612
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:18,995
Ask him.

613
01:22:19,635 --> 01:22:22,126
- Peter.
- Me?

614
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:24,832
You could've called it off.
There was still time.

615
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:26,568
No, there wasn't, thanks to you.

616
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:29,475
If you kept to the plan,
those soldiers might be alive.

617
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:32,343
If you'd stayed here like I suggested,
they definitely would be!

618
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:36,350
- You called us, remember?
- My first mistake.

619
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:39,785
No. Your first mistake was thinking
you could lead these people.

620
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,450
I am not the one who abandoned Narnia.

621
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:50,965
You invaded Narnia. You have no more
right to lead it than Miraz does.

622
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:52,762
You, him, your father...

623
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:56,162
Narnia's better off
without the lot of you.

624
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,404
Stop it!

625
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:42,175
What are you all standing around for?

626
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,045
Telmarines will be here soon enough.

627
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:53,453
Thank you...
my dear little friend.

628
01:23:59,168 --> 01:24:03,764
- Well done, lads.
- Move it faster, mate. Too slow!

629
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:16,143
Beruna pledges its troops.

630
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:20,120
Galma pledges its troops.

631
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:23,090
Tashbaan pledges its troops.

632
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:26,821
Ettinsmoor pledges its troops.

633
01:24:56,458 --> 01:25:00,519
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

634
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:29,081
Are you so glad
of that magic horn now, boy?

635
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:34,457
Your kings and queens have failed us.

636
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:39,866
Your army's half dead. And those
that aren't will be soon enough.

637
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:43,896
What do you want?
Congratulations?

638
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:49,106
You want your uncle's blood.
So do we.

639
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:54,179
You want his throne?
We can get it for you.

640
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:15,903
You tried one ancient power.
It failed.

641
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:19,099
But there is a power greater still.

642
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:23,944
One that kept even Aslan at bay
for near a hundred years.

643
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,157
Who's there?

644
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:42,821
I am hunger.

645
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,732
I am thirst.

646
01:26:49,271 --> 01:26:52,069
I can fast a hundred years...

647
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,766
...and not die.

648
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:58,441
I can lie a hundred nights
on the ice...

649
01:26:59,114 --> 01:27:00,979
...and not freeze.

650
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:06,950
I can drink a river of blood
and not burst.

651
01:27:07,788 --> 01:27:11,986
Show me... your enemies!

652
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:17,259
What you hate, so will we.

653
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:20,062
No one hates better than us.

654
01:27:23,804 --> 01:27:28,264
And you can...
guarantee Miraz's death?

655
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:31,176
And more.

656
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:45,917
Let the circle be drawn.

657
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,226
Wait.

658
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,562
This isn't what I wanted.

659
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:11,269
One drop of Adam's blood
and you free me.

660
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:13,576
Then I am yours, my king.

661
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:15,815
No!

662
01:29:37,773 --> 01:29:39,104
Stop!

663
01:30:20,348 --> 01:30:23,044
Come on! Come.

664
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,586
Get away from him!

665
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,491
Peter, dear.

666
01:30:33,228 --> 01:30:34,889
I've missed you.

667
01:30:37,232 --> 01:30:38,494
Come.

668
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:40,897
Just one drop.

669
01:30:43,138 --> 01:30:45,834
You know you can't do this alone.

670
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:19,706
I know. You had it sorted.

671
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:10,614
Why did you never tell me
about my father?

672
01:32:13,295 --> 01:32:18,198
My mother was a Black Dwarf
from the Northern Mountains.

673
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,968
I risked my life all these years

674
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:26,701
so that one day...

675
01:32:26,775 --> 01:32:30,802
...you might be a better king
than those before you.

676
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:35,779
Then I have failed you.

677
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:44,222
Everything I told you,
everything I didn't,

678
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:48,194
it was only because I believe in you.

679
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:54,224
You have a chance to become the most
noble contradiction in history.

680
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:00,872
The Telmarine who saved Narnia.

681
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,531
You're lucky, you know.

682
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:31,338
What do you mean?

683
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,806
To have seen him.

684
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:41,176
I wish he'd just given me
some sort of proof.

685
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:47,284
Maybe we're the ones who need
to prove ourselves to him.

686
01:33:52,227 --> 01:33:55,162
Pete. You'd better come quickly.

687
01:34:58,126 --> 01:35:01,789
Cakes and kettledrums.
That's your next big plan?

688
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:07,397
Sending a little girl into the darkest
parts of the forest? Alone!

689
01:35:07,469 --> 01:35:11,405
- It's our only chance.
- And she won't be alone.

690
01:35:13,475 --> 01:35:17,275
Haven't enough of us died already?

691
01:35:17,345 --> 01:35:21,748
Nikabrik was my friend too.
But he lost hope.

692
01:35:22,517 --> 01:35:25,509
Queen Lucy hasn't.
And neither have I.

693
01:35:26,621 --> 01:35:28,054
For Aslan.

694
01:35:28,657 --> 01:35:30,181
For Aslan!

695
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:38,725
- Then I'm going with you.
- No. We need you here.

696
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,735
We have to hold them off
until Lucy and Susan get back.

697
01:35:42,805 --> 01:35:44,363
If I may...

698
01:35:49,043 --> 01:35:53,173
Miraz may be a tyrant
and a murderer...

699
01:35:54,949 --> 01:35:59,716
...but as king, he is
subject to the traditions...

700
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:03,655
...and expectations of his people.

701
01:36:03,725 --> 01:36:07,491
There is one in particular
that may buy us some time.

702
01:36:15,837 --> 01:36:18,499
Perhaps they intend to surrender.

703
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,039
No.

704
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,010
They are much too noble for that.

705
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:31,808
"I, Peter, by the gift of Aslan,
by election and by conquest,

706
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:37,051
High King of Narnia, Lord of Cair
Paravel and emperor of the Lone Islands,

707
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:40,253
in order to prevent
the abominable effusion of blood,

708
01:36:40,328 --> 01:36:44,924
do hereby challenge the usurper Miraz to
single combat upon the field of battle.

709
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:50,130
The fight shall be to the death.
The reward shall be total surrender."

710
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:55,473
- Tell me, Prince Edmund...
- King.

711
01:36:56,544 --> 01:37:00,776
- Pardon me?
- It's King Edmund, actually.

712
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:03,510
Just "King," though.
Peter's the high king.

713
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:06,419
I know, it's confusing.

714
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:11,890
Why would we risk such a proposal

715
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:15,361
when our armies could
wipe you out by nightfall?

716
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:19,366
Haven't you already
underestimated our numbers?

717
01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:25,062
I mean, only a week ago
Narnians were extinct.

718
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,334
And so you will be again.

719
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:29,672
Well, then you should have
little to fear.

720
01:37:31,579 --> 01:37:33,672
This is not a question of bravery.

721
01:37:33,749 --> 01:37:37,412
So you're bravely refusing
to fight a swordsman half your age?

722
01:37:39,487 --> 01:37:42,650
I didn't say I refused.

723
01:37:42,724 --> 01:37:45,192
You shall have our support,
Your Majesty.

724
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:47,057
Whatever your decision.

725
01:37:47,128 --> 01:37:52,122
Sire, our military advantage alone
provides the perfect excuse to avoid

726
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,226
- what might otherwise be...
- I'm not avoiding anything!

727
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:58,498
I was merely pointing out

728
01:37:58,573 --> 01:38:01,406
that my lord is well
within his rights to refuse.

729
01:38:01,476 --> 01:38:04,001
His Majesty would never refuse.

730
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:07,809
He relishes the chance
to show the people

731
01:38:07,881 --> 01:38:10,145
the courage of their new king.

732
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:16,414
You.

733
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:24,957
You should hope your brother's sword
is sharper than his pen.

734
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:34,074
Destrier has always served me well.
You are in good hands.

735
01:38:34,142 --> 01:38:35,803
Or hooves.

736
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:44,713
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

737
01:38:48,823 --> 01:38:50,347
Look.

738
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:54,826
Maybe it is time you had this back.

739
01:38:57,365 --> 01:39:01,825
Why don't you hold on to it.
You might need to call me again.

740
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:12,972
- You might need to call me again?
- Oh, shut up.

741
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:02,061
If it should appear
to be going poorly...

742
01:40:06,902 --> 01:40:09,029
Understood, Your Majesty.

743
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:26,715
I hope you won't be too disappointed
when I survive.

744
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:59,812
There is still time to surrender.

745
01:41:02,156 --> 01:41:04,090
Well, feel free.

746
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:06,626
How many more must die for the throne?

747
01:41:07,629 --> 01:41:09,187
Just one.

748
01:41:34,655 --> 01:41:37,317
- Ride!
- They've seen us!

749
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,469
- Take the reins.
- What are you doing?

750
01:41:54,543 --> 01:41:59,242
I'm sorry, Lucy. But it looks as if
you'll be going alone after all.

751
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:18,781
Are you sure you don't need that horn?

752
01:44:35,002 --> 01:44:38,597
Does His Highness need a respite?

753
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:40,299
Five minutes?

754
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:42,802
Three!

755
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,025
Lucy?

756
01:45:04,098 --> 01:45:07,465
She got through... with a little help.

757
01:45:07,534 --> 01:45:10,503
- Thanks.
- Well, you were busy.

758
01:45:10,571 --> 01:45:15,235
I assume you won't let things
get that close again!

759
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:23,507
You better get up there.
Just in case.

760
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:26,017
I don't expect the Telmarines
will keep their word.

761
01:45:30,859 --> 01:45:33,327
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

762
01:45:33,394 --> 01:45:34,952
Be careful.

763
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:37,796
Keep smiling.

764
01:45:50,444 --> 01:45:52,469
How does he look to you?

765
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,480
Young.

766
01:45:57,184 --> 01:46:01,553
But His Majesty's doing
extremely well... for his age.

767
01:46:09,897 --> 01:46:11,421
I think it's dislocated.

768
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:19,470
What do you think happens
back home if you die here?

769
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:26,569
You know you've always been there,
and I never really...

770
01:46:29,751 --> 01:46:31,013
Save it for later.

771
01:48:20,294 --> 01:48:21,693
Respite!

772
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:26,697
Respite.

773
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,866
Now's not the time for chivalry, Peter!

774
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:32,437
Show no mercy!

775
01:48:52,492 --> 01:48:54,983
Look out!

776
01:49:20,955 --> 01:49:23,355
What's the matter, boy?

777
01:49:24,491 --> 01:49:26,652
Too cowardly to take a life?

778
01:49:30,696 --> 01:49:32,789
It's not mine to take.

779
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:17,668
Perhaps I was wrong.

780
01:50:17,743 --> 01:50:23,204
Maybe you do have the makings
of a Telmarine king after all.

781
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:38,855
Not one like you.

782
01:50:48,175 --> 01:50:51,110
Keep your life.

783
01:50:51,178 --> 01:50:54,670
But I am giving the Narnians
back their kingdom.

784
01:51:25,746 --> 01:51:27,008
My king.

785
01:51:30,283 --> 01:51:34,583
I'll deal with you when this is over.

786
01:51:35,455 --> 01:51:38,424
It is over.

787
01:51:52,973 --> 01:51:57,239
Treachery! They shot him!

788
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:59,710
They murdered our king!

789
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:02,538
Be ready!

790
01:52:04,351 --> 01:52:05,511
Peter!

791
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:13,888
Go!

792
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:24,264
To arms, Telmar!

793
01:52:24,337 --> 01:52:26,100
To arms!

794
01:52:30,277 --> 01:52:31,266
Loose!

795
01:52:56,836 --> 01:52:58,303
Cavalry!

796
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:04,074
Attack!

797
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,858
Archers to the ready!

798
01:53:46,653 --> 01:53:48,416
Narnians!

799
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:51,753
Charge!

800
01:54:13,046 --> 01:54:16,209
One, two...

801
01:54:16,283 --> 01:54:18,751
Three, four...

802
01:54:18,818 --> 01:54:21,651
Five, six...

803
01:54:24,024 --> 01:54:25,457
Take your aim!

804
01:54:27,193 --> 01:54:28,626
Stay with them!

805
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:34,027
Eight, nine...

806
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:36,159
Get ready!

807
01:54:37,771 --> 01:54:39,432
Now!

808
01:55:01,628 --> 01:55:04,461
Stop! Back! Back!

809
01:55:06,067 --> 01:55:08,729
Hold it now! Hold it!

810
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:12,929
Now!

811
01:55:28,656 --> 01:55:31,557
Charge!

812
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:45,568
Charge!

813
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:14,361
You're a mouse.

814
01:56:14,434 --> 01:56:16,800
You people have no imagination.

815
01:56:47,434 --> 01:56:49,265
Loose! Loose!

816
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:58,868
Lucy?

817
01:57:07,753 --> 01:57:09,311
Back to the How!

818
01:57:14,594 --> 01:57:16,084
Cut off their escape!

819
01:57:16,162 --> 01:57:17,493
Loose!

820
01:57:19,265 --> 01:57:21,256
Loose!

821
01:57:28,441 --> 01:57:31,842
Brace yourselves!

822
01:57:33,113 --> 01:57:34,671
Back to the How!

823
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:24,157
Crush them all.

824
01:59:35,034 --> 01:59:36,092
Aslan!

825
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:48,978
I knew it was you.
The whole time, I knew it.

826
01:59:49,048 --> 01:59:51,278
But the others didn't believe me.

827
01:59:51,351 --> 01:59:53,819
And why would that stop you
from coming to me?

828
01:59:56,656 --> 01:59:59,523
I'm sorry. I was too scared
to come alone.

829
02:00:01,427 --> 02:00:03,486
Why wouldn't you show yourself?

830
02:00:03,562 --> 02:00:06,793
Why couldn't you come roaring in
and save us like last time?

831
02:00:06,865 --> 02:00:10,460
Things never happen
the same way twice, dear one.

832
02:00:15,474 --> 02:00:20,605
If I'd have come earlier, would everyone
who died... could I have stopped that?

833
02:00:22,649 --> 02:00:25,709
We can never know
what would have happened, Lucy.

834
02:00:25,785 --> 02:00:30,085
But what will happen
is another matter entirely.

835
02:00:30,156 --> 02:00:32,624
- You mean you'll help?
- Of course.

836
02:00:32,692 --> 02:00:36,321
- As will you.
- Oh, I wish I was braver.

837
02:00:36,396 --> 02:00:39,297
If you were any braver,
you'd be a lioness.

838
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:44,393
Now, I think your friends
have slept long enough, don't you?

839
02:01:16,336 --> 02:01:18,429
Come on!

840
02:02:22,201 --> 02:02:23,532
Lucy.

841
02:02:49,862 --> 02:02:52,194
For Aslan!

842
02:02:57,637 --> 02:03:00,504
We can defeat them
if we draw them to the river.

843
02:03:00,573 --> 02:03:03,565
We must regroup. To Beruna!

844
02:03:03,643 --> 02:03:05,668
To the bridge!

845
02:04:03,603 --> 02:04:05,332
Charge!

846
02:04:33,432 --> 02:04:36,333
What is happening?

847
02:04:36,402 --> 02:04:39,371
- The river!
- Retreat!

848
02:04:39,438 --> 02:04:41,429
Back! Back!

849
02:05:43,535 --> 02:05:45,127
Come on.

850
02:06:13,734 --> 02:06:16,134
Assemble on that bank!

851
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:19,667
You will not be harmed!

852
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:23,672
Surrender your weapons!

853
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:26,842
Take off the armor!

854
02:06:43,829 --> 02:06:47,424
Rise, kings and queens of Narnia.

855
02:06:51,037 --> 02:06:52,334
All of you.

856
02:06:57,942 --> 02:06:59,876
I do not think I am ready.

857
02:06:59,945 --> 02:07:03,244
It's for that very reason
I know you are.

858
02:07:51,598 --> 02:07:54,328
Thank you, Your Majesty.

859
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:56,561
Thank you.

860
02:07:58,638 --> 02:08:03,598
Hail, Aslan!
It is a great honor to be in...

861
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:10,276
I'm completely out of countenance.

862
02:08:10,349 --> 02:08:14,217
I must crave your indulgence
for appearing in this unseemly fashion.

863
02:08:16,088 --> 02:08:18,147
Perhaps a drop more?

864
02:08:18,224 --> 02:08:21,284
- I don't think it does that.
- You could have a go.

865
02:08:22,661 --> 02:08:24,390
It becomes you well, small one.

866
02:08:24,462 --> 02:08:27,295
All the same, great king,

867
02:08:27,366 --> 02:08:32,827
I regret that I must withdraw, for a
tail is the honor and glory of a mouse.

868
02:08:32,904 --> 02:08:36,396
Perhaps you think too much
of your honor, friend.

869
02:08:36,475 --> 02:08:41,344
Well, it's not just the honor.
It's also great for balance.

870
02:08:41,413 --> 02:08:44,974
And climbing.
And grabbing things.

871
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:48,417
May it please Your High Majesty,
we will not bear the shame

872
02:08:48,487 --> 02:08:51,479
of wearing an honor denied to our chief.

873
02:08:51,556 --> 02:08:54,457
Not for the sake of your dignity,

874
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:57,290
but for the love of your people.

875
02:09:03,335 --> 02:09:07,829
Look! Thank you, my liege.
I will treasure it always.

876
02:09:07,908 --> 02:09:12,641
From this day forward it will serve
as a great reminder of my huge humility.

877
02:09:14,679 --> 02:09:18,740
Now, where is this dear little friend
you've told me so much about?

878
02:09:38,905 --> 02:09:40,998
Do you see him now?

879
02:10:45,905 --> 02:10:48,874
Because you have snuck in...

880
02:10:48,942 --> 02:10:52,036
I'm sorry, but their future
in that world shall be good.

881
02:10:53,012 --> 02:10:55,071
Your Majesty?

882
02:11:04,757 --> 02:11:08,215
We are ready.
Everyone has assembled.

883
02:11:17,569 --> 02:11:21,972
Narnia belongs to the Narnians,
just as it does to man.

884
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:26,306
Any Telmarines who want to stay
and live in peace are welcome to.

885
02:11:26,378 --> 02:11:28,744
But for any of you who wish,

886
02:11:28,814 --> 02:11:32,443
Aslan will return you
to the home of our forefathers.

887
02:11:32,518 --> 02:11:35,544
It's been generations
since we left Telmar.

888
02:11:35,621 --> 02:11:38,021
We're not referring to Telmar.

889
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:40,786
Your ancestors were seafaring brigands.

890
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:43,555
Pirates run aground on an island.

891
02:11:43,629 --> 02:11:48,760
There they found a cave, a rare chasm
that brought them here from their world.

892
02:11:48,835 --> 02:11:51,599
The same world as our kings and queens.

893
02:11:54,139 --> 02:11:56,573
It is to that island I can return you.

894
02:11:56,641 --> 02:12:00,668
It is a good place for any
who wish to make a new start.

895
02:12:02,781 --> 02:12:03,907
I will go.

896
02:12:06,218 --> 02:12:07,810
I will accept the offer.

897
02:12:15,694 --> 02:12:17,355
So will we.

898
02:12:21,699 --> 02:12:27,535
Because you have spoken first,
your future in that world shall be good.

899
02:13:10,282 --> 02:13:12,409
- Where did they go?
- They killed them.

900
02:13:12,484 --> 02:13:16,215
How do we know he is not
leading us to our death?

901
02:13:16,288 --> 02:13:19,849
Sire. If my example
can be of any service,

902
02:13:19,925 --> 02:13:22,723
I will take 11 mice through
with no delay.

903
02:13:29,835 --> 02:13:33,771
- We'll go.
- We will?

904
02:13:33,839 --> 02:13:37,036
Come on. Our time's up.

905
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:40,444
After all...

906
02:13:41,847 --> 02:13:44,441
...we're not really
needed here anymore.

907
02:13:48,854 --> 02:13:51,322
I will look after it until you return.

908
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:53,415
I'm afraid that's just it.

909
02:13:55,427 --> 02:13:57,190
We're not coming back.

910
02:14:00,365 --> 02:14:01,354
We're not?

911
02:14:02,234 --> 02:14:03,531
You two are.

912
02:14:04,769 --> 02:14:08,432
At least, I think he means you two.

913
02:14:09,374 --> 02:14:11,342
But why?

914
02:14:11,410 --> 02:14:14,675
- Did they do something wrong?
- Quite the opposite, dear one.

915
02:14:14,747 --> 02:14:16,715
But all things have their time.

916
02:14:16,783 --> 02:14:20,241
Your brother and sister have learned
what they can from this world.

917
02:14:20,319 --> 02:14:22,947
Now it's time for them
to live in their own.

918
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:26,992
It's all right, Lu.

919
02:14:28,494 --> 02:14:31,361
It's not how I thought it would be...

920
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:33,830
...but it's all right.

921
02:14:33,899 --> 02:14:37,596
One day you'll see, too.
Come on.

922
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:13,895
I'm glad I came back.

923
02:15:15,307 --> 02:15:17,366
I wish we had more time together.

924
02:15:19,845 --> 02:15:22,211
It would never have worked, anyway.

925
02:15:22,281 --> 02:15:23,976
Why not?

926
02:15:24,049 --> 02:15:26,677
I am 1,300 years older than you.

927
02:15:47,239 --> 02:15:50,402
I'm sure when I'm older I'll understand.

928
02:15:51,443 --> 02:15:54,378
I'm older and don't think
I want to understand.

929
02:17:11,957 --> 02:17:14,448
Aren't you coming, Phyllis?

930
02:17:24,770 --> 02:17:27,568
You don't think there's
any way we can get back?

931
02:17:29,241 --> 02:17:31,007
I've left my
new torch in Narnia.

932
