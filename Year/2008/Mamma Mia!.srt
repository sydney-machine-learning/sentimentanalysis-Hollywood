00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,317
<i>I have a dream</i>

2
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,312
<i>A song to sing</i>

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,391
<i>To help me cope</i>

4
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,438
<i>With anything</i>

5
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,197
<i>If you see the wonder</i>

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,671
<i>Of a fairy tale</i>

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,593
<i>You can take the future</i>

8
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,512
Even if you fail.

9
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,148
Sam Carmichael.

10
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,639
Bill Anderson.

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,239
Harry Bright.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,007
Gentlemen,
I have to go.

13
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,113
Thank you very much. Take care.

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,073
Morning, Rodney.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,194
Taxi!

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,509
JFK, please, as quick as you can.

17
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,599
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

18
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,357
I missed you. Oh, no...

19
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,793
- We're...
- We're...

20
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,791
Sophie, Ali, Lisa!
We're the greatest, bestest mates!

21
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,869
- I'm tough.
- I'm tall.

22
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,791
- I'm tiny.
- And we're gonna rock this place.

23
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,633
- Sophie, it's beautiful.
- I want one.

24
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,948
He did well, didn't he?

25
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,758
I'm getting married tomorrow.

26
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,989
I'm so glad you're here,

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,631
because I have a secret
and I can't tell anybody else.

28
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,474
- Sophie, you're knocked up?
- No! No! No!

29
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,676
I've invited my dad to my wedding.

30
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,392
You are joking!

31
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,029
- You found him at last?
- No! No, no, no, no, no, not exactly.

32
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,555
Okay. You know what my mom always said
when I asked about my father.

33
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,631
It was a summer romance,

34
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,837
and he'd gone long before she realised
that she was expecting me.

35
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,957
And I'd always kind of accepted that
that's all I'd ever know.

36
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,874
Well, I was ransacking some old trunks
and I found this.

37
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,153
It's the diary she kept
the year she was pregnant with me.

38
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,549
Sophie!

39
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,553
"July 17th. What a night!"

40
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,756
- I don't know if I want to hear this!
- I do!

41
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,274
"Sam rowed me over to the little island."

42
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,794
That's here. That's Kalokairi.

43
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,190
"We danced on the beach,
and we kissed on the beach,

44
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,840
"and dot, dot, dot."

45
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,955
What?

46
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,316
"Dot, dot, dot."
That's what they did in the olden days.

47
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,470
Stop it!

48
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,512
"Sam's the one. I know he is.

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,955
"I've never felt like this before."

50
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,669
<i>Honey, honey</i>

51
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,196
<i>How he thrills me</i>
<i>Honey, honey</i>

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,235
<i>Honey, honey</i>

53
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,915
<i>Nearly kills me</i>
<i>Honey, honey</i>

54
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,437
<i>I've heard about him before</i>

55
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,751
<i>I wanted to know some more</i>

56
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,956
<i>And now I know what they mean</i>

57
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,873
<i>He's a love machine</i>

58
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,678
<i>Oh, he makes me dizzy</i>

59
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,870
<i>Honey, honey</i>
<i>Let me feel it</i>

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,279
<i>Honey, honey</i>

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,516
<i>Honey, honey</i>
<i>Don't conceal it</i>

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,919
<i>Honey, honey</i>

63
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,792
<i>The way that you kiss good night</i>

64
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,632
<i>The way that you kiss me good night</i>

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,119
<i>The way that you hold me tight</i>

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,918
<i>The way that you're holding me tight</i>

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,991
<i>I feel like I wanna sing</i>

68
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,913
<i>When you do your thing</i>

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,879
- So this guy Sam's your father!
- The plot thickens.

70
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,509
"All this time, Sam's been telling me
he loves me,

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,397
"and now he's announced
that he's engaged,

72
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,869
"so he's gone home to get married,

73
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,518
"and I'm never going to see him again."

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,794
Poor Donna.

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,589
"August 4th. What a night!

76
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,992
"Bill rented a motorboat,
and I took him over to the little island."

77
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,548
- Bill? Sophie, wait.
- Hang on.

78
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,552
"Though I'm still obsessed with Sam,

79
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,200
"Bill's so wild. He's such a funny guy.

80
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,032
"One thing led to another,

81
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,189
"and dot, dot, dot."

82
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,994
"August 11th.
Harry turned up, out of the blue,

83
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,799
"so I said I'd show him the island.

84
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,917
"He's so sweet and understanding,
I couldn't help it and

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,513
- "dot, dot, dot!"
- Dot, dot, dot!

86
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,876
- Oh, my God!
- Here come the bridesmaids.

87
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,349
Donna!

88
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,193
Look at you!

89
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,635
God! Stop growing!

90
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,590
- You sound like you're having fun already.
- Oh, we are.

91
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,272
I used to have fun.

92
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,679
Oh, we know!

93
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,390
<i>Honey, honey</i>
<i>Touch me, baby</i>

94
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,277
<i>Honey, honey</i>

95
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,831
<i>Honey, honey</i>
<i>Hold me, baby</i>

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,239
<i>Honey, honey</i>

97
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,916
<i>You look like a movie star</i>

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,356
<i>But I love just who you are</i>

99
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,431
<i>And, honey, to say the least</i>

100
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,954
<i>You're a doggone beast</i>

101
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,835
Bugger!

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,397
My sentiments exactly.

103
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,239
So, who is your dad?

104
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,231
- Sam, Bill or Harry?
- I don't know.

105
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,436
But which one did you invite?

106
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,277
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

107
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,395
- Do they know?
- What would you write to a total stranger?

108
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,278
"Please come to my wedding,
you might be my father"? No.

109
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,796
They think that Mom sent the invites,
and with what's in here,

110
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,791
no surprise they said yes!

111
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,397
<i>Honey, honey</i>
<i>How you thrill me</i>

112
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,833
<i>Honey, honey</i>

113
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,957
<i>Honey, honey</i>
<i>Nearly kill me</i>

114
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,393
<i>Honey, honey</i>

115
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,077
<i>I'd heard about you before</i>

116
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,753
<i>I wanted to know some more</i>

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,718
<i>And now I'm about to see</i>

118
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,430
<i>What you mean to me</i>

119
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,516
I'm trying to get to Kalokairi.
When's the next ferry?

120
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,713
- What?
- Monday.

121
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,638
- Bollocks!
- Yeah, my sentiments exactly.

122
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,599
Bride or groom?

123
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,913
Bride, although I've actually never met her.

124
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,473
Ahoy, there.

125
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,109
You guys need a ride to Kalokairi?

126
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,789
Excuse me, coming through.
I have a senior citizen with me. Thank you.

127
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
My mother needs a perch.

128
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,351
Mother? We're the same age.

129
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,238
Yeah. Well, parts of us are.

130
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,554
Sailor.

131
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,588
No.

132
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,832
Oh, he has your book!

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,433
Oh...

134
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,198
Stavros, Stavros.

135
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,669
Stavros.

136
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,038
It's just a fish.

137
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,074
You are so clever.

138
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,469
We're going to look fabulous tomorrow.

139
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,950
I want the perfect wedding,
and I want my father to give me away.

140
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,996
Better be a wide aisle.

141
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,799
I will know my father as soon as I see him.

142
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,550
Sky! Come here, gorgeous.

143
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,392
Put me down.
I'm getting married tomorrow.

144
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,754
Please be careful.

145
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,751
So?
- There are pins in the dresses.

146
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,432
What do you think?

147
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,439
Oh, yes!

148
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,112
"Oh, yes." If you had your way,

149
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,919
it'd be a three-minute wedding
in jeans and T-shirts,

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,638
washed down with a bottle of beer.

151
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,836
You make me sound so unromantic!

152
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,717
I just thought we should save
our money for travelling.

153
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,552
Well, we're not going anywhere yet.

154
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,473
Anyway, please leave. We're very, very busy.

155
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,437
I'm just getting some props for tonight.

156
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,555
Ooh!

157
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,915
For his bachelor party.

158
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,190
Why haven't you told him
you've invited your dads?

159
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,430
Because he would say that
I'd have to tell my mom.

160
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,511
Donna's absolutely gonna kill you
when she finds out.

161
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,398
By the time she finds out, it'll be too late.

162
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,393
I feel like there's a part of me missing,

163
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,757
and when I meet my dad,

164
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,598
everything will fall into place.

165
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,396
More open!
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

166
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,799
That's good.

167
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,875
That's it.

168
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,638
Come on, Cleopatra.

169
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,949
My shoe!

170
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,033
Will you look at what the tide washed in?

171
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,076
- For one night.
- And one night only.

172
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,837
- Donna and the Dynamos!
- Donna and the Dynamos!

173
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,351
Look at you!

174
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,590
- You baby!
- Look at you!

175
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,954
You look fantastic!

176
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,189
You look like an old hippie!

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,998
She looks fab.

178
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,230
These are new, though.
Where did you get these?

179
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,470
Husband number three!

180
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,916
- Dynamos! Dynamite!
- Dynamos! Dynamite!

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,797
Sleep all day and...

182
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,552
All night!

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,150
So, any men at this wedding?

184
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,595
Gorgeous Greeks of independent means?

185
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,797
Here we go! Husband number four!

186
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,509
- No! Not for me, for her!
- He's coming!

187
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,875
For her, now that her book is a bestseller,

188
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,396
and she's got the whole world
stuffing, what,

189
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,268
mushrooms? Various vegetables?

190
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,157
It's time to find Mr Right!

191
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,152
Oh, please. Boring!

192
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,073
Great couple of role models
you two are for Sophie!

193
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,038
A serial bride and a little hermit over here!

194
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,388
That's me! I'm a lone wolf!

195
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,312
So, when are the lovebirds
flying the nest?

196
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,437
Oh, God! Who knows?

197
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,957
You know, I do not know what is going on
in that child's head sometimes.

198
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,508
She wants a big white wedding, and

199
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,433
she and Sky are making
all kinds of plans for the hotel.

200
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,511
Sometimes I think they'll never leave.

201
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,955
Yeah, but do you really want her to?

202
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,315
Well, I want what's best for her.

203
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,509
Of course not!

204
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,797
Sky! Come meet my backup girls.

205
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,677
Backup girls, my ass!
- Backup girls, my ass!

206
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,557
He's the leading man at tomorrow's shindig.

207
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,198
- The lucky man.
- Hello.

208
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,669
- You must be Rosie.
- I am.

209
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,637
- How are you?
- Very well.

210
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,392
And you must be Tanya.

211
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,236
- I've heard so much about you.
- All bad, I hope.

212
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,673
- Yes.
- And all true.

213
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,954
Donna... Here, let me get them.

214
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,397
I know who you are.
You're Bill Anderson, aren't you?

215
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,916
<i>- Bloke in a Boat in Botswana.</i>
- Yes, I am.

216
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,037
You know, your books are a godsend
on dull business trips.

217
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,839
Now, I may look like I'm pondering
my securities, but in reality,

218
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,357
I'm trekking across
some remote corner of the planet.

219
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,317
You should try it for real sometime.

220
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,312
No, certainly, I'll never be
the spontaneous adventurer.

221
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,473
- You're a close friend of Donna's?
- No, I haven't heard from her for 20 years.

222
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,120
- Really?
- And then this invite, out of the blue.

223
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,872
You know, that's a coincidence,
neither had I.

224
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,394
- Going about!
- You got it!

225
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,554
Right. Wait...
I've got it. Fine. Fine.

226
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,994
You should have brought
the iron lung.

227
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,475
Why did I wear stilettos?

228
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,231
- Oxygen.
- Oh, my God!

229
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,995
- Auntie Rosie!
- Hey, hey!

230
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,232
- Look at Sophie. She's gotten so beautiful!
- I know.

231
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,629
Come here to me.

232
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,713
Sophie Sheridan, you get more gorgeous
every time I see you. You do.

233
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,634
- I bet you don't remember me.
- Not with all that plastic surgery.

234
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,869
Of course I do, Auntie Tanya.
You haven't changed at all.

235
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,195
- I'm so happy for you.
- Look at my baby,

236
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,840
her whole life ahead of her.

237
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,948
Oh, please, I'm getting married.
I'm not joining a convent!

238
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,951
- She's feisty. I love that.
- Yeah.

239
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,235
She's a chip off the old block.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,037
If she were more like me,
she wouldn't be getting married at 20.

241
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,712
Or married at all.

242
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,797
I meant to get the laundry down
before you came.

243
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,869
Tanya's going home!

244
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,793
And you'd think with all this
new technology,

245
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,713
they would figure out a machine
that would make the beds.

246
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,950
And if they did,
you'd be going along behind it,

247
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,314
making them again.

248
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,958
I know you, Mom.

249
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,874
But I am good at modern...
Tell them about the Internets.

250
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,996
- He's gonna put me on the line.
- Online.

251
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,399
I'm designing a website.

252
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,473
I just think this place has so much potential,
and no one knows we're here.

253
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,758
So, if I market it really, really well, then,
hopefully, people will come flooding in.

254
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,594
We just want this to be
the ultimate romantic destination.

255
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,955
This was once supposed to be
the site of Aphrodite's fountain,

256
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,429
you know, the goddess of love.
And if you drank the water,

257
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,114
you were supposed to find true love
and perfect happiness.

258
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,998
- I'll have a glass of that.
- Yeah, I'll have a bucket.

259
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,877
<i>Aphrodite's spa?</i>

260
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,349
Well, I thought you didn't want
boatloads of tourists.

261
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,391
Oh, no, not boatloads, no.

262
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,756
But, you know, a few more would be nice.

263
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,868
Okay, now, the thing about the toilet,

264
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,829
if it doesn't flush right away, just go
and come back in a while, and it should...

265
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,349
Nothing works around here, except for me.

266
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,513
I've been running this hotel for 15 years,
and I have never had a day off.

267
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,794
Oh, my God! Sorry.

268
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,469
<i>I work all night</i>
<i>I work all day</i>

269
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,677
<i>To pay the bills I have to pay</i>

270
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,113
<i>Ain't it sad?</i>

271
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,998
<i>And still there never seems to be</i>

272
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,389
<i>A single penny left for me</i>

273
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,515
Don't sit down there.

274
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,635
<i>That's too bad</i>

275
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,039
It's broken.

276
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,079
<i>In my dreams</i>
<i>I have a plan</i>

277
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,436
<i>If I got me a wealthy man</i>

278
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,112
<i>I wouldn't have to work at all</i>

279
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,035
<i>I'd fool around and have a ball</i>

280
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,195
<i>Money, money, money</i>

281
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,111
<i>Must be funny</i>

282
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,111
<i>In a rich man's world</i>

283
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,755
<i>Money, money, money</i>

284
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,637
<i>Always sunny</i>

285
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,836
<i>In a rich man's world</i>

286
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,629
<i>All the things I could do</i>

287
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,917
<i>If I had a little money</i>

288
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,831
<i>It's a rich man's world</i>

289
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,557
<i>It's a rich man's world</i>

290
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,517
<i>A man like that is hard to find</i>

291
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,558
<i>But I can't get him off my mind</i>

292
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,312
<i>Ain't it sad?</i>

293
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,071
<i>And if he happens to be free</i>

294
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,390
<i>I bet he wouldn't fancy me</i>

295
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,678
<i>That's too bad</i>

296
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,992
<i>So I must leave</i>
<i>I have to go</i>

297
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,231
<i>To Las Vegas or Monaco</i>

298
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,117
<i>And win a fortune in a game</i>

299
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,751
<i>My life will never be the same</i>

300
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,275

<i>It's a rich man's world</i>

What's going on?

320
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,639
Do you feel it?

321
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,518
The earth moved, darling.
We're falling apart here.

322
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,592
Don't think about it, come on.
Let's go have fun.

323
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,910
Tanya's packed for a world tour.

324
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,957
Oh, Donna. Donna!

325
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,630
Does she wear it or floss with it?

326
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,869
Floss you.

327
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,029
Is it edible, Tanya?

328
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,155
Listen to this.

329
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,515
"The world's most luxurious moisturiser

330
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,194
"contains flakes of 24-carat gold

331
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,316
"and extracts of donkey testicle."

332
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,799
You're just jealous.

333
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,996
At a thousand dollars a dollop.

334
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,593
Tell you, that's the price you have to pay

335
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,035
if you wanna drink before 11:00
in the morning.

336
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,156
- And we do.
- We do.

337
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,149
Hi.

338
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,475
May I help you?

339
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,471
Sure, we're here for the wedding.

340
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,152
- I'm Bill Anderson.
- Huh?

341
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,511
I'm Bright, Harry Bright.

342
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,159
Sam Carmichael.

343
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,398
You are expecting us?

344
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,351
Oh, my God. Yes!

345
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,116
You're not Donna's daughter?

346
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,990
I thought you looked familiar.

347
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,588
Sofia.

348
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,274
- It's Sophie.
- Well, Sofia is the Greek.

349
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,994
Well, I'm named after a Sofia.

350
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,232
I used to have a great-aunt
living on the mainland named Sofia.

351
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,111
Would you mind if we see our rooms
before we see your mother?

352
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,235
Sure.

353
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,709
It's just that I'd quite like to freshen up
before the big reunion.

354
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,156
No! No! I mean, yes,

355
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,753
but come this way.

356
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,909
Come on!

357
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,799
Oh, my God!

358
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,713
I got a crack in my courtyard.
I gotta go fix it.

359
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,791
- Hey, listen, Donna? Donna.
- I'm serious. Move.

360
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,875
Sit down!

361
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,279
- She won't let me go!
- I know...

362
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,874
I know you're going to make
a fortune with web's...

363
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,394
- "With web's..."
- With Sky's site.

364
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,959
I know you're gonna make a fortune with

365
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,270
- Sky's website, but...
- It's good.

366
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,157
Are you gonna be okay until then?

367
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,595
I think Tanya is offering to pawn her bling.

368
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,989
- No, seriously, Donna...
- Oh, my God.

369
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,230
- Do you need a loan?
- No, sweet.

370
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,790
Oh, God, I'm just whining, you know me.

371
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,030
I don't need to be taken care of.

372
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,634
Yeah, but are you being taken care of?

373
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
- What do you mean?
- Are you getting any?

374
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,709
Oh, you mean...

375
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,678
Down, boy, down, boy.
No, it takes too much energy.

376
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,672
Yeah. Just more plumbing
to be maintained, isn't it?

377
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,988
Yeah.

378
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,834
Oh, God, I'm so glad
that whole part of my life is over.

379
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,433
You know, seriously.

380
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,830
I do not miss it at all.

381
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,714
Then it's just right here. Good.

382
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,310
Where's Donna? Hey! Okay.

383
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,719
Up you go.

384
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,029
Hmm.

385
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,917
You know,

386
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,072
I don't want to seem ungrateful
for the scenic tour,

387
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,639
but might I be shown my room now?

388
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,917
Well, don't hold your breath, Harry,
but I think this is your room.

389
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,433
Can we see Donna now?

390
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,272
I sent the invites.

391
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,711
My mom doesn't know anything.

392
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,272
Well, she's done so much for me,
and she's always talking about you guys

393
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,237
and the good old days, and

394
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,635
I thought, what an amazing surprise for her

395
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,154
that you are all gonna be at my wedding.

396
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,516
Hang on, Sophie.

397
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,353
I can't be here.

398
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,558
The last time I saw your mother,

399
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,437
she said she never wanted to see me again.

400
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,433
That was years ago.
Please, it would mean a lot to me.

401
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,590
- Why?
- Listen, I can see that you've been

402
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,715
to a great deal of trouble.

403
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,109
Might I suggest that we all reconvene
on your boat?

404
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,553
- Good idea.
- Nope.

405
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,230
- Why?
- It's an adventure, Harry.

406
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,992
- It's good for you.
- Oh, I see.

407
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,118
Okay, when I sent the invites,
it was a long shot that you'd even reply.

408
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,112
And now you've come all this way
for a wedding.

409
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,359
Surely there must have been
some special reason for you to be here.

410
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,392
Like some siren call, maybe?

411
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,872
You're a little minx, you know that?
You're just like your mother.

412
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,394
I'm glad my boys haven't met you.
They'd never recover.

413
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,357
- You have sons?
- Yes, two.

414
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,550
And someday, I'd like to bring them here.

415
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,312
Like you used to bring my mother?

416
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,759
- No.
- It's Donna.

417
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,434
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Listen, listen, she can't know.

418
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,873
I'm going to go. Please stay.

419
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,794
Promise me that you'll not tell anybody
that I invited you.

420
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,313
Okay? Promise?

421
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,516
- You got it, baby.
- It's a promise.

422
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,114
- I might regret it, but okay.
- Okay.

423
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,390
There wouldn't, by any chance,
happen to be a trouser press

424
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,799
on the island, would there?

425
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,638
Harry?

426
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,629
Bill?

427
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,311
<i>I was cheated by you</i>

428
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,277
<i>And I think you know when</i>

429
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,996
<i>So I made up my mind</i>

430
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,877
<i>It must come to an end</i>

431
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,517
<i>Look at me now</i>

432
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,953
<i>Will I ever learn?</i>

433
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,031
<i>I don't know how</i>

434
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,237
<i>But I suddenly lose control</i>

435
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,074
<i>There's a fire within my soul</i>

436
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,436
<i>Just one look and</i>
<i>I can hear a bell ring</i>

437
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,592
<i>One more look and</i>
<i>I forget everything</i>

438
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,231
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Here I go again</i>

439
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,676
<i>My, my</i>
<i>How can I resist you?</i>

440
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,991
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Does it show again?</i>

441
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,311
<i>My, my</i>
<i>Just how much I've missed you</i>

442
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,710
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

443
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,076
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

444
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,277
<i>Why, why</i>
<i>did I ever let you go?</i>

445
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,557
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Now I really know</i>

446
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,677
<i>My, my</i>
<i>I should not have let you go</i>

447
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,116
<i>I was angry and sad</i>

448
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,191
<i>When I knew we were through</i>

449
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,750
<i>I can't count all the times</i>

450
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,558
<i>I have cried over you</i>

451
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,670
<i>Look at me now</i>
<i>Will I ever learn?</i>

452
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,751
<i>I don't know how</i>

453
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,116
<i>But I suddenly lose control</i>

454
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,875
<i>There's a fire within my soul</i>

455
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,191
<i>Just one look and</i>
<i>I can hear a bell ring</i>

456
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,556
<i>One more look and</i>
<i>I forget everything</i>

457
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,991
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Here I go again</i>

458
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,356
<i>My, my</i>
<i>How can I resist you?</i>

459
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,750
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Does it show again?</i>

460
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,116
<i>My, my</i>
<i>Just how much I've missed you</i>

461
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,510
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

462
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,831
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

463
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,992
<i>Why, why</i>
<i>did I ever let you go?</i>

464
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,516
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Now I really know</i>

465
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,229
<i>My, my</i>
<i>I should not have let you go</i>

466
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,833
You always knew how to make an entrance.

467
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,559
I'd better be dreaming.
You'd better not be here.

468
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,993
You want me to pinch you, Donna?

469
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,756
No! You keep your hands to yourself,
Bill Anderson.

470
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,195
You probably don't recognise me, do you?

471
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,834
Harry! It is you!

472
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,519
I probably changed a bit,
but you certainly haven't.

473
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,152
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

474
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,798
I'm writing a travel piece.

475
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,757
I'm here on
a spontaneous holiday.

476
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:03,183
Okay. What is this?

477
00:28:03,273 --> 00:28:06,982
It's one of those serendipitous moments
in life when three complete strangers

478
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:08,904
share a common thought.

479
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,461
Strangers?

480
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:15,942
- You don't know each other?
- That's generally the definition.

481
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,986
Okay, good, but who... Why are you here?

482
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,268
Who said that you could
stay up in my old goat-house?

483
00:28:21,353 --> 00:28:22,832
- Didn't catch the name.
- Greek lady.

484
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:24,585
- Well, she spoke Greek.
- Yeah.

485
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:26,743
Or maybe she said we couldn't
stay in the old goat-house.

486
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,744
- Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek.
- There you go.

487
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,301
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
You can't stay here because

488
00:28:31,393 --> 00:28:34,226
I'm closed and I'm full.

489
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,988
And I'm busy, I'm really...
I have a wedding, my...

490
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:39,426
Local girl's getting married...

491
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:40,741
Donna. Donna, don't worry about us.

492
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,232
Bill here is used to roughing it.

493
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:44,747
- And Harry here...
- I'm spontaneous.

494
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,152
- Spontaneous.
- Ah.

495
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:49,911
What about you?

496
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:52,109
Just wanted to see the island.

497
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:54,709
You know what it meant to me.

498
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:59,865
Okay, I'm gonna arrange for a boat

499
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:03,309
to take you all back to the mainland.

500
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:05,304
- I have a boat, Donna.
- You have a boat?

501
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:06,667
Good, get on it,

502
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:07,902
and anchors away.

503
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:09,904
- Hey, Donna...
- Away, away.

504
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,231
It's good to see you.

505
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:22,191
Now, baby, this should
tickle your taste buds.

506
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:25,345
Down, big fella.
I'm old enough to be your mother.

507
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:26,986
Grandmother.

508
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:28,548
Where's Sophie?

509
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:31,631
- I think she went down to the beach.
- What's up?

510
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:41,422
Donna?

511
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,669
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

512
00:29:52,913 --> 00:29:54,312
Talk to her.

513
00:29:56,393 --> 00:30:00,147
<i>Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong</i>

514
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:05,830
Oh, me.

515
00:30:06,753 --> 00:30:11,144
<i>I have never seen such sorrow</i>

516
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:18,072
<i>In your eyes</i>

517
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:23,109
<i>And the wedding is tomorrow</i>

518
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:29,871
<i>How I hate to see you like this</i>

519
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:34,504
<i>There is no way you can deny it</i>

520
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:38,552
<i>I can see</i>

521
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,988
<i>That you're oh, so sad</i>

522
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,984
<i>So quiet</i>

523
00:30:48,695 --> 00:30:53,723
<i>I'm a shoulder you can cry on</i>

524
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:59,250
<i>Your best friend</i>

525
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:03,648
<i>I'm the one you must rely on</i>

526
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:08,372
<i>You were always sure of yourself</i>

527
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,448
<i>Now I see you've broken a feather</i>

528
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:23,731
<i>I hope we can patch it up</i>

529
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:25,447
<i>Together</i>

530
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:32,448
<i>Chiquitita, you and I know</i>

531
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:34,571
<i>How the heartaches come and they go</i>

532
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:38,204
<i>And the scars, they're leaving</i>

533
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:41,446
<i>You'll be dancing once again</i>

534
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:44,174
<i>And the pain will end</i>

535
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:48,009
<i>You will have no time for grieving</i>

536
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:55,013
<i>Chiquitita, you and I cry</i>

537
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:57,211
<i>But the sun is still in the sky</i>

538
00:31:57,295 --> 00:32:00,844
<i>And shining above you</i>

539
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:04,007
<i>Let me hear you sing once more</i>

540
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:06,734
<i>Like you did before</i>

541
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:10,649
<i>Sing a new song, Chiquitita</i>

542
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:15,255
<i>Try once more</i>

543
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:17,644
<i>Like I did before</i>

544
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:20,287
<i>Sing a new song</i>

545
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:24,046
- It's her dad.
- Whose dad?

546
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:26,414
Sophie's dad.

547
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:32,213
Remember how I said it was Sam?
Sam the architect,

548
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:33,808
who had to go home to get married?

549
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:37,046
I'm not sure that it was him,

550
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:41,526
because there were two other guys
around the same time.

551
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:45,772
Donna Sheridan. You shady lady.

552
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:47,174
Why didn't you tell us?

553
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:50,691
Well, I never knew that
I would ever, ever have to.

554
00:32:50,775 --> 00:32:53,767
I never imagined I'd see all three of them

555
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:55,413
in my old goat-house

556
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,963
the day before my daughter's wedding!

557
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:00,809
- The old goat-house?
- The old goat-house?

558
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:06,133
No! No! Wait!

559
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,724
Shoot!

560
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:11,095
Rosie! Tanya!

561
00:33:11,415 --> 00:33:13,645
Wait a minute! Don't let them hear you!

562
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:17,525
- There's no one here.
- Are you sure?

563
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:19,014
Of course I'm sure!

564
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:21,563
Do you think
I would forget my daughter's dads?

565
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:24,453
They were all here. Sam Carmichael,

566
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,413
Bill Anderson and Harry "Head Banger."

567
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:28,723
Harry "Head Banger."

568
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:30,487
They must've gone
back to their boat.

569
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,135
I hope they run aground and drown.

570
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:34,853
What are they doing here?

571
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:36,527
It's like some hideous trick of fate.

572
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:48,733
It's very Greek.

573
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:54,370
- Do they know about Sophie?
- What are they, psychic?

574
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,525
No! I've never told a soul.

575
00:33:56,615 --> 00:33:59,925
Oh, Donna,
keeping it to yourself all these years.

576
00:34:00,015 --> 00:34:02,165
It doesn't matter about me.

577
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:07,568
The only thing that matters
is that Sophie never finds out.

578
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:09,805
Well, maybe she would be cool with it.

579
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:11,374
"Cool with it"?

580
00:34:14,415 --> 00:34:16,531
You don't know my daughter.
This would be like a bombshell.

581
00:34:16,615 --> 00:34:18,207
Donna, they've gone!

582
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:20,013
I don't know that.

583
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:23,724
I don't know where they are.
I don't know why they're here.

584
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:25,931
And I have brought this all on myself

585
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:29,007
because I was a stupid, reckless little slut!

586
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:31,404
Whoa!

587
00:34:31,495 --> 00:34:33,804
Don't you sound like your mother?

588
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:36,764
- I do not!
- Yes, you so do!

589
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:39,653
- Oh, my God, I do not.
- You do, it's Catholic guilt!

590
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:41,293
You've been living like a nun.

591
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,684
Yeah, whatever happened to our Donna?

592
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:45,811
Life and soul of the party,

593
00:34:45,895 --> 00:34:48,534
- <i>el</i> rock chick <i>supremo?</i>
- Yeah, come on.

594
00:34:49,615 --> 00:34:53,164
- I grew up.
- Well, then, grow back down again.

595
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:55,132
- Screw them if they can't take a joke.
- Screw them if they can't take a joke.

596
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:58,490
<i>You can dance</i>

597
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:00,805

602
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:22,492
<i>Friday night and the lights are low</i>

603
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:28,167
<i>Looking out for a place to go</i>

604
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:30,765
<i>Where they play the right music</i>

605
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:32,493
<i>Getting in the swing</i>

606
00:35:32,575 --> 00:35:35,487
<i>You come to look for a king</i>

607
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:41,967
<i>Anybody could be that guy</i>

608
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:46,885
<i>Night is young</i>
<i>and the music's high</i>

609
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:50,888
<i>With a bit of rock music</i>
<i>Everything is fine</i>

610
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,371

623
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:50,570
<i>You're a teaser</i>
<i>You turn them on</i>

624
00:36:51,495 --> 00:36:56,011
<i>Leave them burning</i>
<i>And then you're gone</i>

625
00:36:56,095 --> 00:37:00,008

Wait, wait. Wait!
- Hey, don't leave.

647
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,607
- Whoa, Sophie.
- Sophie!

648
00:38:56,055 --> 00:38:58,523
We're gonna sail around the island.
You wanna come?

649
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:00,810
You promised you'd come to my wedding.

650
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:04,052
Yes, well, your mother ejected us
from the goat-house.

651
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:06,126
She thought we'd better get out of her hair.

652
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:08,524
Donna freaked out when she saw us.

653
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:10,924
- What's all that about?
- No.

654
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:14,847
She's just not even thinking straight.
She's so stressed about the wedding.

655
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:18,211
You know, but she's got no idea
that you're her lovely surprise.

656
00:39:18,295 --> 00:39:20,172
- She'll be so happy tomorrow.
- You think so?

657
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:21,244
Mmm-hmm.

658
00:39:22,295 --> 00:39:26,049
- You took Mom's guitar!
- No, no. I borrowed it. Look.

659
00:39:27,215 --> 00:39:28,489
No, where is it?

660
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:29,974
D.S.

661
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:31,044
Donna Sheridan.

662
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,329
And H.B.

663
00:39:33,295 --> 00:39:34,284
Head Banger.

664
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:36,328
- Head Banger?
- Head Banger?

665
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,851
I bought her this. It cost me ten quid
plus my Johnny Rotten T-shirt.

666
00:39:42,055 --> 00:39:43,807
Your mother knew quite a rebel.

667
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:46,648
I was studying in Paris when I met her.

668
00:39:48,295 --> 00:39:51,571
I hopped on a train
and followed her to Greece,

669
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,647
quite spontaneously.

670
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,487
<i>I can still recall</i>

671
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:02,524
<i>Our last summer</i>

672
00:40:02,615 --> 00:40:04,446
<i>I still see it all</i>

673
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,650
<i>Walks along the Seine</i>

674
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:12,044
<i>Laughing in the rain</i>

675
00:40:12,135 --> 00:40:14,444
<i>Our last summer</i>

676
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:16,924
<i>Memories that remain</i>

677
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,008
<i>We made our way along the river</i>

678
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:24,007
<i>And we sat down in the grass</i>

679
00:40:24,095 --> 00:40:26,563
<i>By the Eiffel Tower</i>

680
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:30,609
<i>I was so happy we had met</i>

681
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:35,488
<i>It was the age of no regret</i>

682
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:37,886
<i>Oh, yes</i>

683
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:42,933
<i>Those crazy years, that was the time</i>

684
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:45,974
<i>Of the flower power</i>

685
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:52,010
<i>But underneath we had a fear of flying</i>

686
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:53,926
<i>Of growing old</i>

687
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:56,326
<i>A fear of slowly dying</i>

688
00:40:56,735 --> 00:40:59,090
<i>We took a chance</i>

689
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:04,295
<i>Like we were dancing our last dance</i>

690
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:06,931
<i>I can still recall</i>

691
00:41:07,015 --> 00:41:09,575
<i>Our last summer</i>

692
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:12,089
<i>I still see it all</i>

693
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:18,613
<i>In the tourist jam</i>
<i>round the Notre Dame</i>

694
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:23,533
<i>Our last summer</i>
<i>Walking hand in hand</i>

695
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:26,444

707
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:12,968
- Sophie!
- Please, I have to go,

708
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:15,489
- but please come tomorrow, okay?
- Absolutely.

709
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:17,526
- We'll be there.
- It's a promise.

Where've you been?

716
00:42:42,215 --> 00:42:44,968
People have been arriving all afternoon.
No one's seen you.

717
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:47,569
I'm sorry, I was around the island, I just...

718
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:49,725
I just lost track of time.

719
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,935
- Where're you going?
- It's my stag do.

720
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,526
My last night of freedom.

721
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:01,446
Which is how some people might see it,
but for me,

722
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:05,012
it's the last night before
the greatest adventure of my life.

723
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:09,250
You know how I said I wanted
to find my father?

724
00:43:09,335 --> 00:43:11,610
Soph, we've been over this a million times.

725
00:43:11,695 --> 00:43:13,890
You don't need a father, you have a family.

726
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:15,613
And you'll never leave me, right?

727
00:43:15,695 --> 00:43:19,324
Are you kidding?
You have turned my world upside down.

728
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:23,809
<i>I wasn't jealous before we met</i>

729
00:43:24,575 --> 00:43:29,171
<i>Now every man that</i>
<i>I see is a potential threat</i>

730
00:43:31,495 --> 00:43:34,931
<i>And I'm possessive</i>
<i>It isn't nice</i>

731
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:39,566
<i>You've heard me saying</i>
<i>that smoking was my only vice</i>

732
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:43,849
<i>But now it isn't true</i>

733
00:43:45,095 --> 00:43:47,211
<i>Now everything is new</i>

734
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:51,971
<i>And all I've learned has overturned</i>

735
00:43:52,055 --> 00:43:55,934
<i>I beg of you</i>

736
00:43:57,495 --> 00:44:03,604
<i>Don't go wasting your emotion</i>

737
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:10,007
<i>Lay all your love on me</i>

738
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:14,169
<i>It was like shooting a sitting duck</i>

739
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:19,167
<i>A little small talk, a smile</i>
<i>and, baby, I was stuck</i>

740
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:25,126
<i>I still don't know what you've done with me</i>

741
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:29,693
<i>A grown-up woman</i>
<i>should never fall so easily</i>

742
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,813
<i>I feel a kind of fear</i>

743
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:38,566
<i>When I don't have you near</i>

744
00:44:38,815 --> 00:44:42,251
<i>Unsatisfied, I skip my pride</i>

745
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:46,453
<i>I beg you, dear</i>

746
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:53,691
<i>Don't go wasting your emotion</i>

747
00:44:54,615 --> 00:45:00,406
<i>Lay all your love on me</i>

748
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:08,174

<i>Excuse me! Hello.</i>

805
00:48:59,575 --> 00:49:02,965
<i>This is a hen party. Women only!</i>

806

<i>- Thank you.</i>
- Okay.

807
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:08,884
Why are they here, then,

808
00:49:08,975 --> 00:49:11,284
if it's not to ruin Sophie's wedding?

809
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,253
But I thought you weren't so keen
on this wedding.

810
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:16,366
I don't want them spoiling it.

811
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:18,491
They have no right to turn up like this.

812
00:49:18,575 --> 00:49:21,135
What have they ever done
for their daughter?

813
00:49:21,215 --> 00:49:23,285
Donna, Donna, they didn't know she existed.

814
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:25,286
Well, they didn't need to know, did they?

815
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,650
I've done a great job with Soph,
all by myself,

816
00:49:27,735 --> 00:49:30,807
and I won't be muscled out
by an ejaculation!

817
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,966
<i>Is there a man out there?</i>

818
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:42,013
<i>Someone to hear my prayer?</i>

819
00:49:42,775 --> 00:49:46,290
<i>Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!</i>
<i>A man after midnight</i>

820
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:49,845
<i>Won't somebody help me</i>
<i>Chase the shadows away</i>

821
00:49:50,535 --> 00:49:53,493
<i>Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!</i>
<i>A man after midnight</i>

822
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:54,974
- Hi.
- Hi.

823
00:49:56,255 --> 00:49:58,974
I think I should explain to Donna
that I come in peace.

824
00:49:59,055 --> 00:50:02,491
Oh, no, really. You should wait
until she has a few drinks in her first.

825
00:50:02,575 --> 00:50:04,486
- Really.
- Good idea. Good idea.

826
00:50:05,615 --> 00:50:07,287
What you drew on the boat...

827
00:50:08,615 --> 00:50:10,970
This is good. This is really good.

828
00:50:11,135 --> 00:50:14,093
Why don't you pursue this?
You have a real talent here.

829
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:17,167
I have enough to do here.

830
00:50:17,255 --> 00:50:19,166
Is that really your dream?

831
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:21,167
Running the villa with Donna?

832
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:23,246
She just can't do it by herself.

833
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:27,368
Do you know,

834
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:30,970
I drew this whole place up
on the back of a menu one night.

835
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,887
I always dreamt I'd come back here.

836
00:50:32,975 --> 00:50:34,408
What kept you?

837
00:50:34,935 --> 00:50:36,891
What's your mother said about me?

838
00:50:36,975 --> 00:50:39,728
- She never mentioned you.
- Sophie?

839
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:43,413
What am I doing here?

840
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,447
Some air in here.

841
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:51,763
Somebody up there has got it in for me.

842
00:50:51,935 --> 00:50:53,050
I bet it's my mother.

843
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:54,966
Oh,
and wasn't she a ray of sunshine.

844
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:57,046
I'm gonna go get them out of here.

845
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:01,933
You go in there guns loaded,
there's gonna be questions.

846
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,926
- Help me out of these boots.
- Come on, then.

847
00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:06,449
All that fricking yoga's
made my feet bigger.

848
00:51:06,535 --> 00:51:09,208
Now, listen.
Listen, what we're gonna do is,

849
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,686
we'll get them plastered tonight,

850
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:16,087
and then tomorrow,
Tanya and I will take them fishing.

851
00:51:16,455 --> 00:51:18,810
Fishing? Oh, please.

852
00:51:19,255 --> 00:51:21,849
What do you suggest
we do with three men?

853
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:25,207
Well, then, now, that takes me back.

854
00:51:26,455 --> 00:51:27,808
<i>Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!</i>

855
00:51:27,895 --> 00:51:30,011
<i>A man after midnight</i>

856
00:51:30,095 --> 00:51:33,690
<i>Take me through the darkness</i>
<i>To the break of the day</i>

857
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,293
- Hello.
- You okay?

858
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:42,967
I'm fine.

859
00:51:45,455 --> 00:51:47,923
Fancy Donna having a grown-up daughter!

860
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:52,733
- Do you have any children, Harry?
- Well, I have the dogs, Lucy and Kipper.

861
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:55,204
That's the extent of my relationships.

862
00:51:55,295 --> 00:51:58,605
I'd have loved a daughter.
I'd have spoiled her rotten.

863
00:52:01,415 --> 00:52:03,929
- Is your father here?
- I don't know.

864
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,646
I don't know who my father is.

865
00:52:10,135 --> 00:52:11,932
<i>Is there a man out there?</i>

866
00:52:13,655 --> 00:52:16,123
<i>Someone to hear my prayer?</i>

867
00:52:17,495 --> 00:52:19,133
This is fantastic!

868
00:52:20,935 --> 00:52:24,086
How on earth did Donna get money
to buy this place?

869
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:28,054
She was left some money by the old lady
she looked after when I was little.

870
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:32,006
- Sofia, that I'm named after.
- My great-aunt Sofia?

871
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:33,569
I guess.

872
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:37,168
I always heard her money was left to family.

873
00:52:44,055 --> 00:52:46,125
- How old are you?
- I'm 20.

874
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:51,765
Will you excuse me a minute?

875
00:52:54,935 --> 00:52:56,163
I'm sorry.

876
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:00,524
Bill!

877
00:53:02,175 --> 00:53:03,494
Bill, wait.

878
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:06,730
Why did your great-aunt
leave my mother money?

879
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:08,248
I don't know!

880
00:53:08,335 --> 00:53:10,849
All my life, there's been
this huge unanswered question,

881
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:13,244
and I don't want any more secrecy!

882
00:53:13,335 --> 00:53:16,168
What do you want from me?
- Bill, please!

883
00:53:20,415 --> 00:53:22,053
Are you my father?

884
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,249
Yes. I think so.

885
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,924
Yes.

886
00:53:30,295 --> 00:53:31,933
You know what comes next?

887
00:53:32,135 --> 00:53:36,253
Oh, you're not going to tell me
that you have a twin sister, are you?

888
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:39,532
Will you give me away tomorrow?

889
00:53:39,935 --> 00:53:42,972
- Give you away?
- No! Our secret until the wedding.

890
00:53:45,935 --> 00:53:47,084
Cute.

891
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:52,924
Oh, God.

892
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,164
Okay.

893
00:54:18,215 --> 00:54:20,285
<i>People everywhere</i>

894
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:23,333
<i>A sense of expectation hanging in the air</i>

895
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,526
<i>Giving out a spark</i>

896
00:54:27,615 --> 00:54:30,527

Sophie, come here.

912
00:55:16,255 --> 00:55:17,927
I know why I'm here.

913
00:55:18,175 --> 00:55:21,565
Why didn't Donna tell me?
How long have you known I'm your father?

914
00:55:22,095 --> 00:55:25,167
What? Not long at all.

915
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:29,250
Sam, listen to me.
My mom doesn't know that I know.

916
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:31,806
So can we wait until after my wedding?

917
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,965
- Who's giving you away tomorrow?
- Nobody.

918
00:55:34,055 --> 00:55:35,408
Wrong. I am.

919
00:55:35,655 --> 00:55:37,373

Now, that's why you sent me the invite.

933
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:09,213
You wanted your old dad
to walk you down the aisle.

- Soph!

Stand back, everybody.
- Give her some space.

950
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,054
Soph...
- Baby!

951
00:56:57,815 --> 00:57:00,727
Come on, Mother, rise and shine.

952
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:02,248
I was tossing and turning all night.

953
00:57:03,455 --> 00:57:06,492
Those three guys are still loose
on this island.

954
00:57:06,575 --> 00:57:07,610
We got to do something.

955
00:57:07,695 --> 00:57:10,846
Donna! Donna! Donna! Donna.
It's all under control.

956
00:57:11,135 --> 00:57:14,730
I have been tossing and turning all night.
I've got three dads coming to my wedding,

957
00:57:14,815 --> 00:57:17,283
and I have to tell two of them
they're surplus. Only, which two?

958
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,649
It's all under control.

959
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,566
I'm taking Bill and Sam fishing...

960
00:57:20,655 --> 00:57:22,771
We're each gonna go off.
We're gonna grab a man,

961
00:57:22,855 --> 00:57:25,085
interrogate him, swap notes and decide.

962
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,689
And Harry's talked Tanya into water sports.

963
00:57:29,055 --> 00:57:31,933
Oh, God.
Nurse, donkey testicles, quickly!

964
00:57:54,695 --> 00:57:57,209
- No, after you. Please.
- No. No. Go ahead.

965
00:57:57,535 --> 00:57:59,491
No, no, no, no, you first.

966
00:58:00,735 --> 00:58:03,647
- I want to get something off my chest.
- Me, too.

967
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:13,768
Last night,
I discovered something wonderful.

968
00:58:14,335 --> 00:58:17,532
It was a wake-up call,
a way to look at myself and

969
00:58:17,815 --> 00:58:20,045
what I really want out of life.

970
00:58:21,935 --> 00:58:25,086
Last night? You didn't know?

971
00:58:26,615 --> 00:58:29,175
You didn't even suspect that you were...

972
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,486
Well, no. Of course not.
That's always been a secret.

973
00:58:34,935 --> 00:58:37,210
And now we... Say it out loud.

974
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:40,571
No! No! No! It's absolutely hush-hush.
I mean, for now.

975
00:58:41,095 --> 00:58:43,245
All will be revealed tonight.

976
00:58:43,935 --> 00:58:46,654
Talking of revelations, last night...

977
00:58:48,335 --> 00:58:51,771
You and the little lady?
I think I know what's going on.

978
00:58:53,455 --> 00:58:55,252
- No, you don't. You don't.
- It's obvious.

979
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:58,293
I saw it from the moment
you clapped eyes on each other.

980
00:58:59,175 --> 00:59:00,574
You're kidding.

981
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,971
I'm gonna level with you, Harry.

982
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:06,245
I don't think I can do this.

983
00:59:06,535 --> 00:59:08,605
Well, she's a wonderful girl,

984
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:11,650
but can I take her on in my life?

985
00:59:11,895 --> 00:59:14,489
Bill, where's your spontaneity?

986
00:59:15,175 --> 00:59:16,813
It's this...

987
00:59:17,735 --> 00:59:21,444
- This family, you know?
- You don't have to marry her.

988
00:59:22,295 --> 00:59:23,284
What?

989
00:59:24,855 --> 00:59:27,767
Hey, right in time for breakfast.

990
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,528
We're serving up the works here.

991
00:59:30,615 --> 00:59:33,846
- Think you just did.
- Sunny-side up! Lox or ham?

992
00:59:34,175 --> 00:59:35,574
I'll just...

993
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:39,607
I'm just gonna...

994
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:44,093
What a mess!

995
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,013
- Hey!
- What?

996
00:59:49,095 --> 00:59:51,450
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

997
00:59:51,535 --> 00:59:53,491
- Sophie.
- What?

998
00:59:55,495 --> 00:59:58,726
Last night, you and Sky... What's wrong?

999
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,614
Tell me. Tell me what's wrong.

1000
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:10,813
- I don't know what to do.
- You know what to do.

1001
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,570
You don't have to do anything.

1002
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,369
Not too late, I can still call off the wedding.
Everybody will understand.

1003
01:00:22,455 --> 01:00:24,571
Call... Call off the wedding?

1004
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,891
- Isn't that what you want?
- No.

1005
01:00:27,615 --> 01:00:28,650
No.

1006
01:00:29,855 --> 01:00:31,766
No, that's what you want.

1007
01:00:32,255 --> 01:00:33,529
- No!
- Yes! God!

1008
01:00:33,615 --> 01:00:34,604
Sophie!

1009
01:00:34,695 --> 01:00:37,163
You just... You have no idea.

1010
01:00:37,255 --> 01:00:38,370
You never had a wedding.

1011
01:00:38,455 --> 01:00:40,207
You never did
the marriage-and-babies thing.

1012
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:41,523
You just did the baby thing.

1013
01:00:41,615 --> 01:00:43,446
- Well, good for you.
- You know, I don't know why

1014
01:00:43,535 --> 01:00:47,050
- you're going off on me now! I really don't!
- Because I...

1015
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:50,488
- God! I love Sky, and I want to be with him!
- Good! Great.

1016
01:00:50,575 --> 01:00:54,693
And I don't want my children growing up
not knowing who their father is.

1017
01:00:54,775 --> 01:00:56,891
Because it's just... It's crap!

1018
01:00:57,255 --> 01:01:00,088
Voulez-vous

1019
01:01:01,255 --> 01:01:04,088

- Stop, you're terrible.

1020
01:01:04,175 --> 01:01:06,006
Come on, man. What are you talking about?

1021
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:10,054
Okay, okay, Sophie's gonna have
an absolutely beautiful wedding, right?

1022
01:01:10,655 --> 01:01:12,566
You're supposed to be helping me.

1023
01:01:12,655 --> 01:01:15,010
You guys... He's got to get ready.

1024
01:01:23,095 --> 01:01:25,245
I see you kept my bagpipes.

1025
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:30,967
They're supposed to ward off
unwanted visitors.

1026
01:01:32,695 --> 01:01:35,414
Well, you don't need bagpipes to do that.

1027
01:01:36,415 --> 01:01:38,565
What are you doing here, Sam?

1028
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:40,925
This is our dream, remember?

1029
01:01:42,215 --> 01:01:45,525
- Villa on the island?
- Yeah. Well, this is my reality.

1030
01:01:46,015 --> 01:01:48,893
Hard work and a crippling mortgage. Shoot!

1031
01:01:50,095 --> 01:01:53,405
And a hotel that's crumbling around me.

1032
01:01:53,495 --> 01:01:57,454
- Look, I'll help... Let me have a look at this...
- No, that's all right, I can

1033
01:01:57,535 --> 01:01:59,446
deal my own disasters.

1034
01:01:59,535 --> 01:02:02,572
Why didn't you tell me
it was Sophie getting married?

1035
01:02:02,655 --> 01:02:04,088
Well, I didn't think
it was any of your business.

1036
01:02:04,175 --> 01:02:06,166
Why is she getting married?
Settling down on the island?

1037
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,213
I mean, if it was up to me,
I'd be telling her to go get a life.

1038
01:02:09,295 --> 01:02:10,967
- Yeah.
- She's a bright kid.

1039
01:02:11,055 --> 01:02:12,886
I know. I know.

1040
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:16,014
But, you know, my daughter
has a mind of her own.

1041
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:20,453
Oh, yeah. I see that. I see that.

1042
01:02:21,895 --> 01:02:23,806
- But she's so young.
- I know.

1043
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,166
I mean, does she know
what she really wants?

1044
01:02:26,255 --> 01:02:29,213
You see, I think part of her
just wants to let you know

1045
01:02:29,295 --> 01:02:32,731
that she isn't going to leave you
alone here, on your own.

1046
01:02:34,975 --> 01:02:37,091
- What do you mean?
- Donna, look.

1047
01:02:37,175 --> 01:02:40,611
I have two grown children.
I know something about letting go.

1048
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,487
If Sophie felt you were okay on your own,

1049
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:44,884
would she want something different
for herself?

1050
01:02:44,975 --> 01:02:46,966
Okay, here's the thing.

1051
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:49,967
I love being on my own. I really do.

1052
01:02:50,055 --> 01:02:52,011
You know, every morning,
I get up and I thank God

1053
01:02:52,095 --> 01:02:54,484
that I don't have some middle-aged,
menopausal man

1054
01:02:54,575 --> 01:02:56,133
telling me how to run my life.

1055
01:02:56,215 --> 01:02:58,809
You know, I'm free and I'm single.

1056
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:02,370
And it's great.

1057
01:03:03,535 --> 01:03:07,687
<i>Where are those happy days?</i>
<i>They seem so hard to find</i>

1058
01:03:09,095 --> 01:03:12,974
<i>I try to reach for you</i>
<i>But you have closed your mind</i>

1059
01:03:14,815 --> 01:03:17,693
<i>What ever happened to our love?</i>

1060
01:03:18,655 --> 01:03:21,044
<i>I wish I understood</i>

1061
01:03:22,495 --> 01:03:26,886
<i>It used to be so nice</i>
<i>It used to be so good</i>

1062
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:33,291
<i>So when you're near me, darling</i>
<i>Can't you hear me?</i>

1063
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,694
<i>SOS</i>

1064
01:03:37,535 --> 01:03:40,732
<i>The love you gave me</i>
<i>Nothing else can save me</i>

1065
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:42,043
<i>SOS</i>

1066
01:03:44,055 --> 01:03:48,606
<i>When you're gone</i>
<i>How can I even try to go on?</i>

1067
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:56,125
<i>When you're gone, though I try</i>
<i>How can I carry on?</i>

1068
01:03:59,815 --> 01:04:04,445
<i>You seem so far away</i>
<i>though you are standing near</i>

1069
01:04:05,415 --> 01:04:10,125
<i>You made me feel alive</i>
<i>but something died, I fear</i>

1070
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:14,451
<i>I really tried to make it out</i>

1071
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:17,886
<i>I wish I understood</i>

1072
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:23,290
<i>What happened to our love?</i>
<i>It used to be so good</i>

1073
01:04:25,735 --> 01:04:29,011
<i>So when you're near me, darling</i>
<i>Can't you hear me?</i>

1074
01:04:29,095 --> 01:04:30,369
<i>SOS</i>

1075
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:36,445
<i>And the love you gave me</i>
<i>Nothing else can save me</i>

1076
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:37,729
<i>SOS</i>

1077
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,367
<i>- When you're gone</i>
<i>- When you're gone</i>

1078
01:04:41,455 --> 01:04:44,891
<i>- How can I even try to go on?</i>
<i>- How can I even try to go on?</i>

1079
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:48,972
<i>- When you're gone</i>
<i>- When you're gone</i>

1080
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:52,730
<i>- Though I try how can I carry on?</i>
<i>- Though I try how can I carry on?</i>

1081
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:17,811
Donna must be tearing her hair out,
doing this wedding on her own.

1082
01:05:17,895 --> 01:05:20,534
What would the father of the bride
normally do?

1083
01:05:20,615 --> 01:05:24,767
Pay. Though my dad
drew the line at my third.

1084
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:27,893
I see. Excuse me.

1085
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:30,204
Harry?

1086
01:05:33,015 --> 01:05:34,130
Harry!

1087
01:05:34,855 --> 01:05:39,212
Tanya! Let's pick up
where we left off last night.

1088
01:05:39,695 --> 01:05:41,811
Last night never happened.

1089
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:44,250
I've drawn a veil over last night.

1090
01:05:44,895 --> 01:05:47,409
Oh, my God. Look at the time.
I've got work to do.

1091
01:05:47,495 --> 01:05:49,929
- Work?
- A little repair and renovation.

1092
01:05:50,015 --> 01:05:53,610
Come on.
You don't mess with a masterpiece.

1093
01:05:53,695 --> 01:05:56,573
Oh, ignore him, Tanya,
he's all mouth and no trousers.

1094
01:05:56,655 --> 01:05:58,850
Tanya can't ignore the chemistry
between us.

1095
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:02,325
Little boys who play with fire
get their fingers burned.

1096
01:06:08,575 --> 01:06:11,612
<i>You're so hot, teasing me</i>

1097
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:16,930
<i>So you're blue</i>
<i>Well, I can't take a chance on a kid like you</i>

1098
01:06:18,455 --> 01:06:20,411
<i>It's something I couldn't do</i>

1099
01:06:23,295 --> 01:06:26,651
<i>There's that look in your eyes</i>

1100
01:06:26,855 --> 01:06:31,531
<i>I can read in your face</i>
<i>that your feelings are driving you wild</i>

1101
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,971
<i>Oh, but, boy, you're only a child</i>

1102
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:41,004
<i>Well, I can dance with you, honey</i>
<i>If you think it's funny</i>

1103
01:06:41,095 --> 01:06:43,655
<i>But does your mother know</i>
<i>that you're out?</i>

1104
01:06:44,255 --> 01:06:48,009
<i>And I can chat with you, baby</i>
<i>Flirt a little, maybe</i>

1105
01:06:48,095 --> 01:06:50,484
<i>Does your mother know</i>
<i>that you're out?</i>

1106
01:06:51,335 --> 01:06:54,691
<i>- Take it easy</i>
<i>- Take it easy. Better slow down, boy</i>

1107
01:06:54,775 --> 01:06:58,165
<i>That's no way to go</i>
<i>Does your mother know?</i>

1108
01:06:58,255 --> 01:07:01,565
<i>- Take it easy</i>
<i>- Take it easy. Try to cool it, boy</i>

1109
01:07:01,655 --> 01:07:05,011
<i>Play it nice and slow</i>
<i>Does your mother know?</i>

1110
01:07:11,455 --> 01:07:13,093
Come on, boy.

1111
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:22,053
<i>I can see what you want</i>

1112
01:07:22,695 --> 01:07:27,325
<i>But you seem pretty young</i>
<i>To be searching for that kind of fun</i>

1113
01:07:28,935 --> 01:07:30,846
<i>So maybe I'm not the one</i>

1114
01:07:33,615 --> 01:07:36,925
<i>Now you're so cute</i>
<i>I like your style</i>

1115
01:07:37,295 --> 01:07:42,813
<i>And I know what you mean</i>
<i>When you give me a flash of that smile</i>

1116
01:07:43,335 --> 01:07:45,895
<i>But, boy, you're only a child</i>

1117
01:07:47,775 --> 01:07:51,654
<i>Well, I can dance with you, honey</i>
<i>If you think it's funny</i>

1118
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:54,044
<i>Does your mother know</i>
<i>that you're out?</i>

1119
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:58,444
<i>And I can chat with you, baby</i>
<i>Flirt a little, maybe</i>

1120
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,930
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1121
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:05,409
<i>Well, I can dance with you, honey</i>
<i>If you think it's funny</i>

1122
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:07,804
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1123
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:12,283
<i>And I can chat with you, baby</i>
<i>Flirt a little, maybe</i>

1124
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:14,684
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1125
01:08:15,735 --> 01:08:18,533
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1126
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:21,291
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1127
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:25,004
<i>Does your mother know?</i>
<i>Does your mother know that you're out?</i>

1128
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:32,134
Boy down! Boy down!

1129
01:08:32,215 --> 01:08:35,252
Yo, girls. We done good.

1130
01:08:36,815 --> 01:08:38,533
Yes, any colour. Doesn't matter.

1131
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:41,652
There's no plan,
God knows there's no plan.

1132
01:08:41,735 --> 01:08:43,691
- It looks great, though.
<i>- Ella,</i> Donna, where would you like this?

1133
01:08:43,775 --> 01:08:46,608
Carlos, get the meat out of the heat.

1134
01:08:46,695 --> 01:08:50,688
Put a cover on that thing. That's beautiful.
And tell... lone, help him get the...

1135
01:08:50,775 --> 01:08:53,608
- Harry, what are you doing here?
- Hello.

1136
01:08:53,695 --> 01:08:55,526
I just wanted to give you this.

1137
01:08:55,615 --> 01:08:57,333
I don't mean here, here.

1138
01:08:57,415 --> 01:09:01,408
- I mean, why are you on this island?
- I realised...

1139
01:09:01,495 --> 01:09:03,929
What is this?

1140
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:07,371
Now, I realised you'll have had to
tighten your belt a bit over the years,

1141
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,411
bringing up Sophie on your own,

1142
01:09:09,495 --> 01:09:12,771
and I just wanted to make
a small contribution to the wedding.

1143
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:19,807
- I can't accept this. I can't...
- No. No.

1144
01:09:20,175 --> 01:09:21,494
- Harry, I can't.
- No. No.

1145
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:24,453
- Harry? I can't...
- No, you'll have to catch me first.

1146
01:09:25,935 --> 01:09:28,324
- Sky.
- What's the matter?

1147
01:09:28,535 --> 01:09:30,969
- You have to help me.
- Why, what's happened?

1148
01:09:31,495 --> 01:09:32,484
Baby?

1149
01:09:33,695 --> 01:09:34,844
Sophie!

1150
01:09:35,695 --> 01:09:36,764
Soph.

1151
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:41,089
I've done something completely insane.

1152
01:09:41,775 --> 01:09:44,528
All my dads are here for our wedding,
and they all think they're giving me away.

1153
01:09:44,615 --> 01:09:46,048
All your what?

1154
01:09:47,415 --> 01:09:51,408
I read Mom's diary,
and I have three possible fathers.

1155
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:54,691
But how are they here now?

1156
01:09:55,015 --> 01:09:56,528
I invited them.

1157
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:00,206
I thought that I would know my dad
right away,

1158
01:10:00,295 --> 01:10:01,887
but I didn't. I just...

1159
01:10:01,975 --> 01:10:04,443
I have no idea.
And now, my mom is gonna kill me,

1160
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:06,765
- and they're gonna hate me, and you...
- Hold on. Hold on.

1161
01:10:06,855 --> 01:10:08,891
You invited these guys
and you didn't tell me?

1162
01:10:08,975 --> 01:10:11,569
No, I thought you would try to stop me.

1163
01:10:12,855 --> 01:10:14,971
- I know I messed up.
- Sophie?

1164
01:10:16,455 --> 01:10:18,810
Is that what this whole
big white wedding is about?

1165
01:10:18,895 --> 01:10:21,568
- You finding your dad?
- No. No!

1166
01:10:21,655 --> 01:10:24,010
I wanted to take a boat to the mainland
with a couple of witnesses.

1167
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:26,848
And you insisted on this sodding circus
so you could play Happy Families.

1168
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:30,132
It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted
to get married knowing who I am.

1169
01:10:30,215 --> 01:10:32,968
That doesn't come from finding your father,

1170
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:35,644
that comes from finding yourself.

1171
01:10:36,855 --> 01:10:39,972
And the irony is,
I was travelling to find myself.

1172
01:10:41,295 --> 01:10:43,650
I put everything on hold for you.

1173
01:10:45,895 --> 01:10:48,284
Because I loved you
and I wanted what you wanted.

1174
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:49,728
Now, I don't know.

1175
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:51,569
You don't know if you love me?

1176
01:10:51,655 --> 01:10:54,613
Of course I love you.
I just wish you'd told me.

1177
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:57,967
Is everything okay?

1178
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:00,811
- Sophie, what's wrong?
- Not now, Sam.

1179
01:11:00,895 --> 01:11:02,408
Yes, yes, yes, now.

1180
01:11:02,495 --> 01:11:04,486
Because I'm supposed to be
giving you away.

1181
01:11:04,575 --> 01:11:06,566
And how can I when I know
you're not really gonna be happy?

1182
01:11:06,655 --> 01:11:09,692
I've heard all this from my mother, and
I think she knows me better than you do.

1183
01:11:09,775 --> 01:11:12,494
I know. But I've done the big white wedding,
and believe me,

1184
01:11:12,575 --> 01:11:16,124
- it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."
- That is you. That's not me.

1185
01:11:16,215 --> 01:11:18,888
Okay? I love Sky more than anything
in the world. And I...

1186
01:11:20,095 --> 01:11:22,893
Did you feel that way
before you got married?

1187
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:25,690
No.

1188
01:11:41,655 --> 01:11:44,852
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
getting dressed?

1189
01:11:44,935 --> 01:11:47,927
Where's Ali and Lisa?
I thought they were going to help you.

1190
01:11:48,015 --> 01:11:49,573
Will you help me?

1191
01:11:50,695 --> 01:11:51,684
Mmm-hmm.

1192
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:57,689
Wait. It's okay, it's okay.

1193
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,493
We have time.

1194
01:12:03,295 --> 01:12:06,207
<i>Schoolbag in hand</i>

1195
01:12:06,295 --> 01:12:10,846
<i>She leaves home in the early morning</i>

1196
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:12,812
<i>Waving goodbye</i>

1197
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:18,208
<i>With an absent-minded smile</i>

1198
01:12:18,295 --> 01:12:20,934
<i>I watch her go</i>

1199
01:12:21,015 --> 01:12:25,213
<i>With a surge of that well-known sadness</i>

1200
01:12:25,295 --> 01:12:30,494
<i>And I have to sit down for a while</i>

1201
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:34,451
<i>The feeling that I'm losing her</i>

1202
01:12:34,535 --> 01:12:37,686
<i>Forever</i>

1203
01:12:37,775 --> 01:12:43,645
<i>And without really entering her world</i>

1204
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:48,934
<i>I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter</i>

1205
01:12:49,055 --> 01:12:53,412
<i>That funny little girl</i>

1206
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,811
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1207
01:12:56,895 --> 01:13:01,332
<i>I try to capture every minute</i>

1208
01:13:01,415 --> 01:13:06,694
<i>The feeling in it</i>
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1209
01:13:06,775 --> 01:13:09,573
<i>Do I really see what's in her mind?</i>

1210
01:13:09,655 --> 01:13:14,445
<i>Each time I think I'm close to knowing</i>

1211
01:13:14,535 --> 01:13:16,571
<i>She keeps on growing</i>

1212
01:13:16,655 --> 01:13:22,332
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1213
01:13:22,415 --> 01:13:25,134
<i>Sleep in our eyes</i>

1214
01:13:25,215 --> 01:13:29,731
<i>Her and me at the breakfast table</i>

1215
01:13:29,815 --> 01:13:31,646
<i>Barely awake</i>

1216
01:13:31,735 --> 01:13:37,128
<i>I let precious time go by</i>

1217
01:13:37,215 --> 01:13:43,734
<i>Then when she's gone</i>
<i>There's that odd melancholy feeling</i>

1218
01:13:43,815 --> 01:13:50,209
<i>And a sense of guilt I can't deny</i>

1219
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:56,609
<i>What happened to</i>
<i>those wonderful adventures</i>

1220
01:13:56,695 --> 01:14:01,007
<i>The places I had planned for us to go</i>

1221
01:14:01,095 --> 01:14:02,892
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1222
01:14:02,975 --> 01:14:05,853
<i>Well, some of that we did</i>

1223
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:08,403
<i>But most we didn't</i>

1224
01:14:08,495 --> 01:14:12,408
<i>And why, I just don't know</i>

1225
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:15,294
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1226
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:20,324
<i>I try to capture every minute</i>

1227
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:25,728
<i>The feeling in it</i>
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1228
01:14:25,815 --> 01:14:28,534
<i>Do I really see what's in her mind?</i>

1229
01:14:28,615 --> 01:14:33,484
<i>Each time I think I'm close to knowing</i>

1230
01:14:33,575 --> 01:14:35,531
<i>She keeps on growing</i>

1231
01:14:35,615 --> 01:14:40,769
<i>Slipping through my fingers all the time</i>

1232
01:14:48,695 --> 01:14:50,731
Do you think I'm letting you down?

1233
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,449
Why would you even think that?

1234
01:14:55,535 --> 01:14:58,333
Well, because of what you've done.

1235
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:01,373
I mean, the Dynamos, raising a kid,

1236
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,685
and running a business all on your own.

1237
01:15:03,815 --> 01:15:06,773
Well, honey, I didn't have a choice.

1238
01:15:06,855 --> 01:15:09,415
I couldn't go home, you know.

1239
01:15:11,135 --> 01:15:16,129
When I got pregnant, my mother told me
not to bother coming back.

1240
01:15:18,535 --> 01:15:21,095
And I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1241
01:15:21,175 --> 01:15:23,484
My God, look at what we've had.

1242
01:15:28,095 --> 01:15:29,892
Will you give me away?

1243
01:15:39,415 --> 01:15:40,404
Yeah.

1244
01:15:44,175 --> 01:15:45,927
<i>Sometimes I wish</i>

1245
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:51,135
<i>That I could freeze the picture</i>

1246
01:15:51,215 --> 01:15:55,174
<i>And save it from the funny tricks of time</i>

1247
01:15:55,335 --> 01:16:00,045
<i>Slipping through my fingers</i>

1248
01:16:30,815 --> 01:16:33,568
<i>Schoolbag in hand</i>

1249
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:38,331
<i>She leaves home in the early morning</i>

1250
01:16:38,415 --> 01:16:40,451
<i>Waving goodbye</i>

1251
01:16:40,535 --> 01:16:46,883
<i>With an absent-minded smile</i>

1252
01:16:53,055 --> 01:16:54,044
Donna!

1253
01:16:54,895 --> 01:16:57,648
Donna. I need to talk to you about
who's giving Sophie away.

1254
01:16:57,735 --> 01:16:59,646
- That would be me.
- But...

1255
01:16:59,735 --> 01:17:02,329
- What about her dad?
- Her dad isn't here.

1256
01:17:02,415 --> 01:17:06,044
It's what she wants.
She told me she wants her father here.

1257
01:17:06,215 --> 01:17:10,367
- What if her father wants that, too?
- What? Sam, don't do this now.

1258
01:17:10,455 --> 01:17:13,492
I can't hear this now!

1259
01:17:13,575 --> 01:17:17,045
Donna, listen to me. This is about us.

1260
01:17:18,215 --> 01:17:19,807
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>

1261
01:17:21,615 --> 01:17:23,810
<i>About things we've gone through</i>

1262
01:17:25,095 --> 01:17:26,926
<i>Though it's hurting me</i>

1263
01:17:28,535 --> 01:17:30,685
<i>Now it's history</i>

1264
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:35,333
<i>I've played all my cards</i>

1265
01:17:36,295 --> 01:17:39,890
<i>And that's what you've done, too</i>

1266
01:17:39,975 --> 01:17:43,092
<i>Nothing more to say</i>

1267
01:17:43,175 --> 01:17:45,814
<i>No more ace to play</i>

1268
01:17:47,175 --> 01:17:50,850
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1269
01:17:50,935 --> 01:17:54,484
<i>The loser standing small</i>

1270
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:58,284
<i>Beside the victory</i>

1271
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:02,334
<i>That's her destiny</i>

1272
01:18:02,415 --> 01:18:05,930
<i>I was in your arms</i>

1273
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:09,325
<i>Thinking I belonged there</i>

1274
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:12,771
<i>I figured it made sense</i>

1275
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:15,653
<i>Building me a fence</i>

1276
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:20,610
<i>Building me a home</i>

1277
01:18:20,735 --> 01:18:24,284
<i>Thinking I'd be strong there</i>

1278
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,366
<i>But I was a fool</i>

1279
01:18:27,575 --> 01:18:31,409
<i>Playing by the rules</i>

1280
01:18:31,495 --> 01:18:35,090
<i>The gods may throw the dice</i>

1281
01:18:35,175 --> 01:18:38,770
<i>Their minds as cold as ice</i>

1282
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:42,450
<i>And someone way down here</i>

1283
01:18:42,535 --> 01:18:46,130
<i>Loses someone dear</i>

1284
01:18:46,215 --> 01:18:49,730
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1285
01:18:49,815 --> 01:18:53,364
<i>The loser has to fall</i>

1286
01:18:53,455 --> 01:18:57,084
<i>It's simple and it's plain</i>

1287
01:18:57,175 --> 01:19:01,009
<i>Why should I complain?</i>

1288
01:19:01,095 --> 01:19:04,690
<i>But tell me does she kiss</i>

1289
01:19:04,775 --> 01:19:08,211
<i>Like I used to kiss you?</i>

1290
01:19:08,295 --> 01:19:11,810
<i>Does it feel the same</i>

1291
01:19:11,895 --> 01:19:15,604
<i>When she calls your name?</i>

1292
01:19:15,695 --> 01:19:19,483
<i>Somewhere deep inside</i>

1293
01:19:19,575 --> 01:19:22,806
<i>You must know I miss you</i>

1294
01:19:22,895 --> 01:19:24,647
<i>But what can I say?</i>

1295
01:19:26,255 --> 01:19:29,884
<i>Rules must be obeyed</i>

1296
01:19:29,975 --> 01:19:33,604
<i>The judges will decide</i>

1297
01:19:33,695 --> 01:19:37,324
<i>The likes of me abide</i>

1298
01:19:37,415 --> 01:19:41,090
<i>Spectators at the show</i>

1299
01:19:41,175 --> 01:19:44,611
<i>Always staying low</i>

1300
01:19:44,695 --> 01:19:48,210
<i>The game is on again</i>

1301
01:19:48,295 --> 01:19:51,890
<i>A lover or a friend</i>

1302
01:19:51,975 --> 01:19:55,570
<i>A big thing or a small</i>

1303
01:19:55,655 --> 01:19:59,933
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1304
01:20:01,415 --> 01:20:03,326
<i>I don't wanna talk</i>

1305
01:20:04,935 --> 01:20:07,403
<i>'Cause it makes me feel sad</i>

1306
01:20:08,655 --> 01:20:10,850
<i>And I understand</i>

1307
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:14,245
<i>You've come to shake my hand</i>

1308
01:20:15,975 --> 01:20:19,650
<i>I apologise</i>

1309
01:20:19,735 --> 01:20:23,171
<i>If it makes you feel bad</i>

1310
01:20:23,255 --> 01:20:25,769
<i>Seeing me so tense</i>

1311
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:29,970
<i>No self-confidence, but you see</i>

1312
01:20:30,055 --> 01:20:33,809
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1313
01:20:37,255 --> 01:20:43,649
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1314
01:20:44,935 --> 01:20:47,972
<i>The game is on again</i>

1315
01:20:48,055 --> 01:20:51,650
<i>A lover or a friend</i>

1316
01:20:51,735 --> 01:20:55,205
<i>A big thing or a small</i>

1317
01:20:55,295 --> 01:21:00,210
<i>The winner takes it all</i>

1318
01:21:00,615 --> 01:21:06,451
<i>So the winner takes it all</i>

1319
01:21:07,695 --> 01:21:13,691
<i>And the loser has to fall</i>

1320
01:21:14,975 --> 01:21:21,210
<i>So the winner takes it all</i>

1321
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:27,807
<i>And the loser has to fall</i>

1322
01:21:27,895 --> 01:21:29,408
Donna!

1323
01:21:30,535 --> 01:21:34,289
<i>The winner takes it</i>

1324
01:21:36,255 --> 01:21:41,887
<i>All</i>

1325
01:21:58,015 --> 01:22:00,609
Donna, there you are.

1326
01:22:00,935 --> 01:22:02,846
- It's okay.
- They're my best shoes.

1327
01:22:02,935 --> 01:22:05,244
Panic over! Here she is.
- She's here.

1328
01:22:05,335 --> 01:22:08,327
- Oh, don't worry.
- Oh, God.

1329
01:22:55,175 --> 01:22:56,290
I love you.

1330
01:23:01,855 --> 01:23:04,050
Welcome to Sophie and Sky,

1331
01:23:04,135 --> 01:23:07,684
and to all your friends
who have gathered together this evening.

1332
01:23:07,935 --> 01:23:11,974
And welcome, especially, to Donna,
who represents your family.

1333
01:23:12,055 --> 01:23:13,966
We are all here together in this

1334
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:17,252
- glorious...
- And welcome to...

1335
01:23:17,335 --> 01:23:18,688
To

1336
01:23:18,775 --> 01:23:20,094
Sophie's dad.

1337
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:24,725
- I have to tell you. He is here.
- I know. I invited him.

1338
01:23:26,855 --> 01:23:29,130
You couldn't have.
I don't know which one it is.

1339
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:33,414
Oh, my God.

1340
01:23:34,415 --> 01:23:37,327
- That's why they're all here!
- I'm sorry. Sorry. I just...

1341
01:23:37,415 --> 01:23:40,805
Please, please forgive me!
Please forgive me. Please.

1342
01:23:40,895 --> 01:23:42,533
I don't know.

1343
01:23:45,255 --> 01:23:47,564
- Can you forgive me?
- What?

1344
01:23:48,455 --> 01:23:51,891
I don't care if you slept with
hundreds of men.

1345
01:23:53,415 --> 01:23:56,612
You're my mom, and I love you so much.

1346
01:23:58,535 --> 01:24:00,127
Oh, Soph.

1347
01:24:03,015 --> 01:24:06,087
And I haven't slept with hundreds of men.

1348
01:24:09,735 --> 01:24:12,727
Am I getting this right?

1349
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:17,650
Sophie may be mine,
but she may be Bill's or Harry's?

1350
01:24:17,735 --> 01:24:21,250
Yeah, yeah. That's right.
And don't get all self-righteous with me,

1351
01:24:21,335 --> 01:24:23,929
because you have
no one but yourself to blame.

1352
01:24:24,015 --> 01:24:28,008
Yeah, if you hadn't just dumped my mother
and gone off and married somebody else...

1353
01:24:28,095 --> 01:24:32,486
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
I had to go home. I was engaged.

1354
01:24:32,575 --> 01:24:35,806
But I told Lorraine I couldn't marry her,
and I came right back.

1355
01:24:39,215 --> 01:24:41,171
You... You...

1356
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:44,685
- Why didn't you call me?
- Because I was crazy enough

1357
01:24:44,775 --> 01:24:46,288
to think that you would be waiting for me.

1358
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:49,811
Only when I arrived, they told me
you were off with some other guy.

1359
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:56,573
So, Lorraine called me an idiot
and married me to prove it.

1360
01:24:56,695 --> 01:24:58,651
Sorry, can I just... Might I just butt in?

1361
01:24:58,735 --> 01:25:00,612
Oh, Harry, don't... It's all right.
You don't have to.

1362
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:05,325
No, no, I just wanted to say it's great
to have even a third of Sophie.

1363
01:25:05,415 --> 01:25:08,452
I never thought I'd get
even that much of a child.

1364
01:25:08,655 --> 01:25:11,488
Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved.

1365
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:15,526
Well, actually, you were
the last girl I ever loved.

1366
01:25:17,015 --> 01:25:20,132
Now, this gives me an excuse
to come here much more often.

1367
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,093
We can find out if you want,

1368
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:25,246
but I'm with Harry.

1369
01:25:26,135 --> 01:25:29,764
- Being a third of your dad is great by me.
- By me, too.

1370
01:25:29,855 --> 01:25:31,208
I'll take a third.

1371
01:25:31,295 --> 01:25:35,652
Typical, isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad,
and then three come along at once.

1372
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:40,450
Dearly beloved...

1373
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:46,167
You know, I have no clue which one of you
is my dad, but I don't mind.

1374
01:25:46,815 --> 01:25:49,568
Now, I know what I really want.

1375
01:25:49,655 --> 01:25:51,247
Sky, let's just not get married yet.

1376
01:25:51,335 --> 01:25:53,132
- What?
- What?

1377
01:25:54,455 --> 01:25:56,446
You never wanted this anyway.

1378
01:25:56,535 --> 01:26:01,165
I know that. Let's just get off this island
and just see the world. Okay? All right?

1379
01:26:01,255 --> 01:26:02,608
I love you.

1380
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:12,487
Donna, do I take it the wedding
is cancelled?

1381
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:15,649
I'm not entirely sure
what's happening right now.

1382
01:26:15,735 --> 01:26:17,214
Hang on.

1383
01:26:19,695 --> 01:26:21,606
Why waste a good wedding?

1384
01:26:23,655 --> 01:26:25,486
How about it, Sheridan?

1385
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:30,048
You're going to need someone
to boss around on this island of yours.

1386
01:26:30,855 --> 01:26:35,326
Are you nuts? I am not a bigamist.

1387
01:26:35,415 --> 01:26:40,284
Neither am I. I'm a divorced man
who's loved you for 21 years,

1388
01:26:41,575 --> 01:26:44,169
and ever since the day
I set foot on this island,

1389
01:26:44,255 --> 01:26:47,292
I've been trying to tell you
how much I love you.

1390
01:26:54,895 --> 01:26:59,173
Come on, Donna.
It's only the rest of your life.

1391
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:07,169
<i>I can't conceal it</i>
<i>Don't you see?</i>

1392
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:09,849
<i>Can't you feel it?</i>

1393
01:27:11,455 --> 01:27:13,252
<i>Say I do</i>

1394
01:27:13,335 --> 01:27:14,324
Oh, yeah.

1395
01:27:14,415 --> 01:27:19,125
<i>I do, I do, I do, I do, I do</i>

1396
01:27:20,815 --> 01:27:23,693
<i>Donna, please show it</i>

1397
01:27:23,775 --> 01:27:28,246
<i>You love me</i>
<i>And you know it</i>

1398
01:27:28,335 --> 01:27:30,803
<i>Say I do</i>

1399
01:27:32,775 --> 01:27:34,174
<i>I do</i>

1400
01:27:34,815 --> 01:27:37,727
I do, I do,

1401
01:27:37,815 --> 01:27:41,046
I do, I do.

1402
01:27:47,055 --> 01:27:51,492
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1403
01:27:59,695 --> 01:28:01,208
I'm so happy!

1404
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:26,525
<i>Here's to us</i>
<i>One more toast</i>

1405
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:30,967
<i>And then we'll pay the bill</i>

1406
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:34,491
<i>Deep inside both of us</i>

1407
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:38,568
<i>Could feel the autumn chill</i>

1408
01:28:38,975 --> 01:28:42,331
<i>Birds of passage</i>
<i>You and me</i>

1409
01:28:42,415 --> 01:28:45,725
<i>We fly instinctively</i>

1410
01:28:46,815 --> 01:28:49,852
<i>When the summer's over</i>

1411
01:28:49,935 --> 01:28:53,644
<i>And the dark clouds hide the sun</i>

1412
01:28:54,855 --> 01:28:58,325
<i>Neither you nor I'm to blame</i>

1413
01:28:58,415 --> 01:29:01,851
<i>When all is said and done</i>

1414
01:29:08,895 --> 01:29:12,171
<i>In our lives</i>
<i>We have walked</i>

1415
01:29:12,255 --> 01:29:15,213
<i>Some strange and lonely treks</i>

1416
01:29:15,295 --> 01:29:16,444
Yeah.

1417
01:29:16,535 --> 01:29:18,446
<i>Slightly worn</i>

1418
01:29:18,535 --> 01:29:20,253
<i>but dignified</i>

1419
01:29:20,335 --> 01:29:23,247
<i>And not too old for sex</i>

1420
01:29:23,335 --> 01:29:24,654
Yeah!

1421
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:28,171
<i>Clear-headed and open-eyed</i>

1422
01:29:28,255 --> 01:29:31,486
<i>With nothing left untried</i>

1423
01:29:32,495 --> 01:29:36,534
<i>Standing calmly at the crossroads</i>

1424
01:29:36,615 --> 01:29:39,413
<i>No desire to run</i>

1425
01:29:40,535 --> 01:29:44,050
<i>There's no hurry any more</i>

1426
01:29:44,135 --> 01:29:47,411
<i>When all is said and done</i>

1427
01:29:48,575 --> 01:29:52,284
<i>Standing calmly at the crossroads</i>

1428
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:55,048
<i>No desire to run</i>

1429
01:29:56,495 --> 01:29:59,726
<i>There's no hurry any more</i>

1430
01:29:59,815 --> 01:30:03,933
<i>When all is said</i>

1431
01:30:04,015 --> 01:30:06,529
<i>And done</i>

1432
01:30:13,415 --> 01:30:18,933
That's not for me. I'm a writer. Lone wolf.

1433
01:30:25,135 --> 01:30:27,444
<i>If you change your mind</i>

1434
01:30:31,935 --> 01:30:33,891
<i>I'm the first in line</i>

1435
01:30:36,095 --> 01:30:39,292
<i>Honey, I'm still free</i>

1436
01:30:42,255 --> 01:30:44,723
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1437
01:30:44,815 --> 01:30:46,009
Sorry.

1438
01:30:48,255 --> 01:30:51,611
<i>If you need me, let me know</i>

1439
01:30:51,695 --> 01:30:54,163
<i>I'm gonna be around</i>

1440
01:30:54,255 --> 01:30:56,928
<i>If you got no place to go</i>

1441
01:30:57,055 --> 01:30:58,932
<i>If you're feeling down</i>

1442
01:30:59,015 --> 01:31:00,050
Speech!

1443
01:31:01,735 --> 01:31:03,771
I'm gonna make a speech, everybody.

1444
01:31:03,855 --> 01:31:05,129
Yeah, get ready.

1445
01:31:09,135 --> 01:31:13,367
<i>If you're all alone</i>
<i>When the pretty birds have flown</i>

1446
01:31:13,455 --> 01:31:17,687
<i>Honey, I'm still free</i>
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1447
01:31:17,775 --> 01:31:21,768
<i>Gonna do my very best</i>
<i>And it ain't no lie</i>

1448
01:31:21,855 --> 01:31:26,292
<i>If you put me to the test</i>
<i>If you let me try</i>

1449
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:29,685
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1450
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,168
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1451
01:31:32,255 --> 01:31:33,244
Go, Bill.

1452
01:31:35,135 --> 01:31:37,091
<i>We can go dancing</i>

1453
01:31:37,455 --> 01:31:41,368
<i>- We can go walking</i>
<i>- As long as we're together</i>

1454
01:31:43,815 --> 01:31:46,010
<i>Listen to some music</i>

1455
01:31:46,095 --> 01:31:47,847
<i>Maybe just talking</i>

1456
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:50,290
<i>You'd get to know me better</i>

1457
01:31:51,175 --> 01:31:54,645
<i>'Cause you know I've got</i>
<i>So much that I wanna do</i>

1458
01:31:54,735 --> 01:31:56,453
<i>When I dream I'm alone with you</i>

1459
01:31:56,535 --> 01:31:59,254
<i>It's magic</i>

1460
01:31:59,335 --> 01:32:02,964
<i>- You want me to leave it there</i>
<i>- Afraid of a love affair</i>

1461
01:32:03,055 --> 01:32:07,253
<i>But I think you know</i>

1462
01:32:07,335 --> 01:32:10,532
<i>That I can't let go</i>

1463
01:32:10,655 --> 01:32:14,807
<i>If you're all alone</i>
<i>When the pretty birds have flown</i>

1464
01:32:14,895 --> 01:32:18,808
<i>Honey, I'm still free</i>
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1465
01:32:18,895 --> 01:32:22,968
<i>Gonna do my very best</i>
<i>And it ain't no lie</i>

1466
01:32:23,215 --> 01:32:24,568
<i>If you put me to the test</i>

1467
01:32:25,735 --> 01:32:30,013
<i>If you let me try</i>
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1468
01:32:32,095 --> 01:32:35,451
<i>Take a chance on me</i>

1469
01:32:54,015 --> 01:32:58,486
It's Aphrodite!

1470
01:33:03,615 --> 01:33:06,493
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Here I go again</i>

1471
01:33:06,575 --> 01:33:10,045
<i>My, my</i>
<i>How can I resist you?</i>

1472
01:33:10,135 --> 01:33:13,525
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Does it show again?</i>

1473
01:33:13,695 --> 01:33:16,971
<i>My, my</i>
<i>Just how much I've missed you?</i>

1474
01:33:17,055 --> 01:33:20,252
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

1475
01:33:20,335 --> 01:33:23,645
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

1476
01:33:23,735 --> 01:33:26,533
<i>Why, why</i>
<i>did I ever let you go?</i>

1477
01:33:26,615 --> 01:33:30,290
<i>Mamma mia</i>
<i>Now I really know</i>

1478
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:34,448
<i>My, my</i>
<i>I should not have let you go</i>

1479
01:33:40,095 --> 01:33:43,405
<i>I have a dream</i>

1480
01:33:44,695 --> 01:33:47,334
<i>A song to sing</i>

1481
01:33:49,135 --> 01:33:53,686
<i>To help me cope</i>

1482
01:33:53,775 --> 01:33:56,608
<i>With anything</i>

1483
01:33:58,895 --> 01:34:02,524
<i>If you see the wonder</i>

1484
01:34:03,375 --> 01:34:06,526
<i>Of a fairy tale</i>

1485
01:34:07,935 --> 01:34:11,132
<i>You can take the future</i>

1486
01:34:12,575 --> 01:34:15,965
<i>Even if you fail</i>

1487
01:34:17,055 --> 01:34:21,446
<i>I believe in angels</i>

1488
01:34:21,535 --> 01:34:26,165
<i>Something good in everything I see</i>

1489
01:34:26,255 --> 01:34:29,372
<i>I believe in angels</i>

1490
01:34:30,695 --> 01:34:34,654
<i>When I know the time is right for me</i>

1491
01:34:34,775 --> 01:34:38,814
<i>I'll cross the stream</i>

1492
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:43,766
<i>I have a dream</i>

1493
01:34:43,855 --> 01:34:48,406
<i>I'll cross the stream</i>

1494
01:34:48,495 --> 01:34:54,650
<i>I have a dream</i>

1495
01:35:10,215 --> 01:35:12,490
<i>You can dance</i>

1496
01:35:12,575 --> 01:35:14,805
<i>You can jive</i>

1497
01:35:14,895 --> 01:35:18,012
<i>Having the time of your life</i>

1498
01:35:19,455 --> 01:35:21,730
<i>See that girl</i>

1499
01:35:21,815 --> 01:35:23,407
<i>Watch that scene</i>

1500
01:35:23,495 --> 01:35:26,134
<i>Dig in the dancing queen</i>

1501
01:35:33,295 --> 01:35:35,684
<i>Friday night and the lights are low</i>

1502
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:40,454
<i>Looking out for a place to go</i>

1503
01:35:42,495 --> 01:35:44,770
<i>Where they play the right music</i>

1504
01:35:44,855 --> 01:35:46,368
<i>Getting in the swing</i>

1505
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:49,094
<i>You come to look for a king</i>

1506
01:35:51,735 --> 01:35:55,694
<i>Anybody could be that guy</i>

1507
01:35:56,375 --> 01:36:00,846
<i>Night is young</i>
<i>and the music's high</i>

1508
01:36:00,935 --> 01:36:04,769
<i>With a bit of rock music</i>
<i>Everything is fine</i>

1509
01:36:04,855 --> 01:36:08,894
<i>You're in the mood for a dance</i>

1510
01:36:08,975 --> 01:36:13,491
<i>And when you get the chance</i>

1511
01:36:13,575 --> 01:36:16,885
<i>You are the dancing queen</i>

1512
01:36:16,975 --> 01:36:22,413
<i>Young and sweet</i>
<i>Only seventeen</i>

1513
01:36:23,935 --> 01:36:26,210
<i>Dancing queen</i>

1514
01:36:26,295 --> 01:36:30,254
<i>Feel the beat</i>
<i>from the tambourine</i>

1515
01:36:30,335 --> 01:36:32,166
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1516
01:36:33,175 --> 01:36:35,405
<i>You can dance</i>

1517
01:36:35,495 --> 01:36:37,725
<i>You can jive</i>

1518
01:36:37,815 --> 01:36:41,171
<i>Having the time of your life</i>

1519
01:36:42,335 --> 01:36:44,769
<i>See that girl</i>

1520
01:36:46,935 --> 01:36:49,688
<i>Watch that scene</i>

1521
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:54,889
<i>Dig in the dancing queen</i>

1522
01:37:02,175 --> 01:37:04,848
- Bye.
- Bye.

1523
01:37:07,135 --> 01:37:08,204
You want another one?

1524
01:37:08,855 --> 01:37:11,574
Do you want another one?

1525
01:37:11,655 --> 01:37:14,044
Do you want another one?

1526
01:37:14,135 --> 01:37:15,693
- Let's give it to them!
- You want another one?

1527
01:37:15,775 --> 01:37:16,810
Let's rip it up!

1528
01:37:22,455 --> 01:37:28,690
<i>My, my, at Waterloo</i>
<i>Napoleon did surrender</i>

1529
01:37:28,775 --> 01:37:33,326
<i>Oh, yeah</i>
<i>And I have met my destiny</i>

1530
01:37:33,415 --> 01:37:35,883
<i>In quite a similar way</i>

1531
01:37:36,655 --> 01:37:39,727
<i>The history book on the shelf</i>

1532
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:44,246
<i>Is always repeating itself</i>

1533
01:37:44,815 --> 01:37:49,172
<i>Waterloo</i>
<i>I was defeated, you won the war</i>

1534
01:37:51,095 --> 01:37:55,088
<i>Waterloo</i>
<i>Promise to love you for ever more</i>

1535
01:37:57,335 --> 01:38:01,374
<i>Waterloo</i>
<i>Couldn't escape if I wanted to</i>

1536
01:38:03,615 --> 01:38:07,688
<i>Waterloo</i>
<i>Knowing my fate is to be with you</i>

1537
01:38:09,855 --> 01:38:13,928
<i>Waterloo</i>
<i>Finally facing my Waterloo</i>

1538
01:38:15,895 --> 01:38:18,932
<i>And how could I ever refuse</i>

1539
01:38:19,015 --> 01:38:22,182
<i>I feel like
I win when I lose</i>

1540
01:38:22,455 --> 01:38:26,812
<i>Waterloo</i>
<i>I was defeated, you won the war</i>

1541
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:32,768
<i>Waterloo</i>
