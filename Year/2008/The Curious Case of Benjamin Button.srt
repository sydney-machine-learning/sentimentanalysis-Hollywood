1
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,030
...and I'll tell you what,
the storm system's still moving west.

2
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,120
What are you looking at, Caroline?

3
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,750
The wind, Mom.

4
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,250
They say the hurricane is coming.

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,050
I'm on a boat.

6
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,470
I'm drifting.

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,100
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

8
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,310
Make anything easier?

9
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,690
Oh, sugar...

10
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,480
There's nothing left to do.

11
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,610
Is what it is.

12
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,070
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

13
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,160
My mouth's full of cotton.

14
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,830
There, there, Miss Daisy.

15
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,670
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

16
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,380
Do you want any more
medication, Mother?

17
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,470
Doctor said you could have
as much as you want.

18
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,850
No need for anybody to suffer.

19
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,740
A friend told me
that she never had the chance

20
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,160
to say goodbye to her mother.

21
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,620
- I wanted to...
- It's okay.

22
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,250
I wanted to tell you
how much I'm gonna miss you so...

23
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,840
Mom.

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,590
Oh, Caroline.

25
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,890
Are you afraid?

26
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,720
I'm curious.

27
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,100
What comes next?

28
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,400
They built the train station in 1918.

29
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,200
My father was there the day it opened.

30
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,580
He said they had

31
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,790
a tuba band playing.

32
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,630
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

33
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,050
to build that glorious clock.

34
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,470
His name was...

35
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,190
Mr. Gateau.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,730
Mr. Cake.

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,450
He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish

38
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,780
and they had a son.

39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,830
Mr. Gateau was, from birth,
absolutely blind.

40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,340
When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.

41
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,640
And they prayed God would
keep him out of harm's way.

42
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,310
For months,
he did nothing but work on that clock.

43
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,810
One day,

44
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,110
a letter came.

45
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,080
And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,

46
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,290
went up, alone, to bed.

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,750
And their son came home.

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,720
They buried him in the family plot,

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
where he would be with them
when their time came.

50
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,850
Mr. Cake worked on his clock,

51
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,320
laboring to finish.

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,530
It was a morning to remember.

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,990
Papa said
there were people everywhere.

54
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,000
Even Teddy Roosevelt came.

55
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,600
It's running backwards!

56
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,980
I made it that way

57
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,440
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war

58
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,900
might stand and come home again.

59
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,240
Home to farm,

60
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,580
work,

61
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,830
have children.

62
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,590
To live long, full lives.

63
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,470
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

64
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,690
I'm sorry if I've offended anybody.

65
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,520
I hope you enjoy my clock.

66
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,280
Mr. Cake was never seen again.

67
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,080
Some say he died of a broken heart.

68
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,120
Some say he went to sea.

69
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,380
Excuse me.

70
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,050
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

71
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,430
Sure.

72
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,900
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

73
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,110
You couldn't disappoint me.

74
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,450
Well, I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

75
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,450
Find my dark suitcase.

76
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,710
There's a diary.

77
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,960
This?

78
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,590
Could you read it to me?

79
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,390
Is this what you want to do?

80
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,390
I tried to read it
a hundred different times.

81
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,350
Mom, it's not exactly...

82
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,860
It's just the sound of your voice, darling.

83
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,690
Okay.

84
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
It's dated April 4th, 1985.

85
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,290
And it says New Orleans.

86
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,120
"This is my last will and testament.

87
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,420
"I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money, really.

88
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,050
"I will go out of this world the same way
I came in, alone and with nothing.

89
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,590
"All I have is my story,

90
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,100
"and I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

91
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,060
"My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button."

92
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,560
And I was born under
unusual circumstances.

93
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,730
The First World War had ended,

94
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,320
and I've been told it was
an especially good night to be born.

95
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,110
Thank God it's over!

96
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,030
We won the war!

97
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,760
The Great War is over!

98
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,020
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,440
Thomas,

100
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,110
I'm afraid she's going to die.

101
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,400
What?

102
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,200
That's enough.
All of you, get away from her.

103
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,500
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

104
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,870
Thomas.

105
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,960
Promise me he has a place.

106
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,500
Yeah.

107
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,880
She gave her life for me.

108
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,890
And for that, I am forever grateful.

109
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,900
Mr. Button.

110
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,410
Thomas!

111
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,790
Thomas.

112
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,960
Thomas? Where are you going?

113
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,910
Hey! What are you doing there?

114
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,200
What do you have there?

115
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,180
- Come on, Queenie.
- Now, Mr. Weathers!

116
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,640
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

117
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,020
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

118
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,980
The air is sweet.

119
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,490
You look very handsome tonight,
Miss Queenie.

120
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,950
Handsome as I've ever seen.

121
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,620
The brown matches your eyes.

122
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,080
Oh, hush!

123
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,670
Let's see here.
You ain't no slouch yourself.

124
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,060
Hambert's back in town.

125
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,940
He came home legless, but he's home.

126
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,560
I know you were sweet on him one time.

127
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,940
Sweeter than I should've been.

128
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,940
Miss Simone messed herself.

129
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,280
Oh, sweet Jesus.

130
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,910
She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

131
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,070
- I'll be right there, Miss Jameson!
- Now, Queenie, now come on.

132
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,740
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

133
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,080
It's awful nice out here.

134
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,420
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

135
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,540
You're so bad.

136
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,130
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

137
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,720
Oh, the Lord done something here.

138
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,310
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

139
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,940
We best leave that for the police.

140
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,560
Poor baby.

141
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,730
I'll go.

142
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,070
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it.
Come on, baby.

143
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,160
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

144
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,200
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

145
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,410
Okay. No, go, I'll be back.

146
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,540
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed
herself all over again!

147
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,500
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

148
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,670
And mind your own business,
Mrs. Duprey.

149
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,590
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

150
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,260
Somebody stole my necklace.

151
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,300
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

152
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,600
Go on back upstairs, hear?

153
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,440
You are as ugly as an old pot

154
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,190
but you're still a child of God.

155
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,650
Queenie, Apple,
she won't take a bath without you!

156
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,240
Mercy.

157
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I'll be right there!

158
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,290
Okay. You just wait right here
for me now, okay?

159
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,250
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

160
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,170
- Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
- They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

161
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,590
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

162
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,300
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

163
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,390
Your heart is strong.

164
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,480
You just want to avoid
any undue stimulation.

165
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,190
I trust you ladies
will help me out with that?

166
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,440
I have something.
Could you come downstairs?

167
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,830
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

168
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm not sure if he can hear.
His bones indicate severe arthritis.

169
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,210
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

170
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,880
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities, not of a newborn,

171
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,630
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

172
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
He's dying?

173
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,100
His body is failing him
before his life's begun.

174
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,890
Where'd he come from?

175
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,350
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

176
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,360
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

177
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,990
There are places for unwanted babies
like these, Queenie.

178
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,290
No room for another mouth to feed here.

179
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,910
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

180
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,790
thinks this place is
a large nuisance as it is.

181
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,090
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

182
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,760
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

183
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,890
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

184
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,020
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

185
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,520
Y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.

186
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,320
We're gonna have us a visitor

187
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,530
that's gonna be staying with us
for a little while.

188
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,370
My sister had a child
and she couldn't see right by it, so...

189
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,370
He's known as...

190
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,880
Benjamin.

191
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,710
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

192
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,880
I had 10 children.

193
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,340
There's not a baby I can't care for.
Let me see him.

194
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,180
God in Heaven.
He looks just like my ex-husband.

195
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,640
Look, he's prematurely old.

196
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,690
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more
time on this earth.

197
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,150
Join the club.

198
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,740
He's smiling!

199
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,160
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

200
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,300
Are you right out of your mind?

201
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,970
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

202
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,310
but this ain't yours to keep.

203
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,690
It may not even be humankind.

204
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,240
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

205
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,780
Please.

206
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,720
You never know what's coming for you.

207
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,110
It seemed I had found a home.

208
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,320
Is any of this true?

209
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,820
You have such a lovely voice.

210
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,040
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.

211
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,870
That clock just kept going,

212
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,090
year after year after year.

213
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,260
But I didn't know I was a child.

214
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,850
Same old crap every day.

215
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,520
I thought I was like everyone else there.

216
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,690
An old man in the twilight of his life.

217
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,150
Could you make him stop that?

218
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,190
Stop banging that fork.
It's used for eating, not for playing with.

219
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,150
And use your napkin, please,
Mr. Benjamin.

220
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,780
Queenie!

221
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,170
Hey, boy.

222
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,850
Always had a healthy curiosity.

223
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,480
What was up the street?
Or around the next corner?

224
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,650
Go get him!

225
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,440
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

226
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,900
Stay put, child.

227
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
I loved her very much.

228
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,660
She was my mother.

229
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,750
Mama.

230
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,330
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

231
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,800
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

232
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,090
But we're all going the same way.

233
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,100
Just taking different roads to get there,
that's all.

234
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,680
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

235
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,110
Mama? How much longer I got?

236
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,900
Just be thankful
for what you're given, hear?

237
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,110
You're already here longer
than you're supposed to.

238
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,910
Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone.

239
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,300
I didn't mind.

240
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,930
I would listen to the house breathing.

241
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,180
All those people sleeping.

242
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,850
I felt safe.

243
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,290
It was a place of great routine.

244
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,290
Every morning at 5:30,
no matter the weather,

245
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,500
General Winslow, U. S. Army, Retired,
would raise the flag.

246
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,300
Mrs. Sybil Wagner,
once an opera singer of some note,

247
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,060
well, she sang Wagner.

248
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,280
All right, baby, come on.

249
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,240
We got to put some life
into these old sticks for you.

250
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,660
Get you walking so you can help me out
around here. Come on now, hear?

251
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,580
No matter the season,
supper was served promptly at 5:30.

252
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:44,010
Molasses.

253
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,510
I learned to read when I was five.

254
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,970
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

255
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,810
He brung home every play
for me to read.

256
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,770
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

257
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,320
"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

258
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,820
"Even like a man
new haled from the rack,

259
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,620
"So fare my limbs
with long imprisonment.

260
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,000
"And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

261
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,580
"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer."

262
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,550
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

263
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,300
The actor my grandfather worked for
was John Wilkes Booth.

264
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,640
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

265
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,060
You never know what's coming for you.

266
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,360
On Saturday nights,
Mama would make me go to church.

267
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,530
Benjamin!

268
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,210
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

269
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,380
What can I do for you, sister?

270
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,680
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

271
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,530
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

272
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,740
so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

273
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,240
Out, damnable affliction!

274
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,490
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

275
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,740
Hallelujah!

276
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,330
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

277
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,170
And what's this old man's irrediction?

278
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,250
He's got the Devil on his back,

279
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,670
trying to ride him into the grave
before his time.

280
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,390
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes!

281
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,350
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

282
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,930
How old are you?

283
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,560
Seven. But I look a lot older.

284
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,150
God bless you.

285
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,190
He's seven.

286
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,950
Now, this is a man
with optimism in his heart.

287
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,740
- All right.
- Belief in his soul!

288
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,820
- Yes!
- Yes!

289
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,740
We are all children in the eyes of God!

290
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,120
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

291
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,120
We are gonna get you out of that chair.

292
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,250
- And we're gonna have you walk.
- Amen.

293
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,710
It's all right.

294
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,840
In the name of God's glory...

295
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,130
Rise up!

296
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,010
Come on.

297
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,600
Come on. Walk.

298
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,140
Come on, son. Come on.

299
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,980
- Come on with it, son. Come on.
- Come on.

300
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,440
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

301
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,320
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

302
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,240
He's gonna see that you walk
from faith...

303
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,320
- Hallelujah!
...and divine inspiration alone!

304
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,570
- Yes.
- Hey, Ben!

305
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,990
- Go, son!
- Now walk.

306
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,330
- Yes.
- Come on.

307
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,080
Don't touch him.

308
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,210
Rise up, old man.

309
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,840
Rise up like Lazarus.

310
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,090
I said, rise up!

311
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,090
Hallelujah!

312
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,470
Yes.

313
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,140
Come on.

314
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,220
Say hallelujah.

315
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,730
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

316
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,650
Walk.

317
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,520
Walk on. Yes.

318
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,400
That's right, Benjamin.

319
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,740
Now when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.

320
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,910
But you know the saying, the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.

321
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,040
Glory in the highest!

322
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,290
Sweet Jesus!

323
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,540
- No!
- No!

324
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,340
There were so many birthdays.

325
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,970
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...

326
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,680
So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.

327
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,810
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

328
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,480
And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.

329
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,690
You always knew
when someone left us.

330
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,320
There was a silence in the house.

331
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,630
It was a wonderful place to grow up.

332
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:38,220
I was with people who had shed
all the inconsequences of earlier life.

333
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,010
Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath,

334
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,470
the light at the end of a day.

335
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,860
For everyone that died, someone would
come to take their place.

336
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,190
I've been married five times.

337
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,410
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

338
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,570
Oh, goodness gracious.

339
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,120
We escaped across the river.

340
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,620
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

341
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,910
Oh, my God.

342
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,880
My second wife steps on cobra
and dies.

343
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,170
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

344
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,300
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

345
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,510
- The next summer I'm captured...
- He's a Pygmy.

346
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,470
...with three others
by the Baschiele tribe.

347
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:28,470
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer
to a very strange American man.

348
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,080
I hear you're not so old
as you're looking.

349
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,410
You just fooling everybody.

350
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,000
What's the matter?
Did you get Madjembe?

351
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,500
What's Madjembe?

352
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,920
Worms.

353
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,590
I don't think I have worms.

354
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,760
This is just how I am.

355
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,720
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

356
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,180
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

357
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,390
I found the medication
under your pillow.

358
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,690
I'm not supposed to. It's dangerous.

359
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,520
Who said that? Come on, little man.

360
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,480
Hello, children.

361
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,250
Hold, please.

362
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,210
Then I'm in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

363
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,630
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

364
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,970
Look.

365
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,640
What's it like living in a cage?

366
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,220
It stinks.

367
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,140
But the monkeys.

368
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,980
They do some tricks there.

369
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,900
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

370
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,490
She is orangutan.

371
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,410
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

372
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,660
in my cage, with my teeth.

373
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,630
So then what'd you do?

374
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:27,590
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

375
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,090
You were all alone?

376
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,470
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

377
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,020
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

378
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,900
But I'll tell you a little secret.

379
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,280
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,

380
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,400
white people,
they're just as alone as we are.

381
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,160
But they're scared shitless.

382
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,000
I think about the river I grew up on.

383
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,380
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

384
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,010
Come, I have an appointment.

385
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,970
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

386
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,390
Always ready. Always ready.

387
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,310
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

388
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,400
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

389
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,480
You can find your own way home,
can't you?

390
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,320
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

391
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,910
Hey! Hey!

392
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,770
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

393
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,520
I mean, you take my breath away,
you know that?

394
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,520
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

395
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,780
It had been the best day of my life.

396
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,410
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

397
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,040
They say it'll reach us in a few hours,

398
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,040
so I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

399
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,620
They say there's nothing to worry about
here in the hospital.

400
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,210
Nurses'll be right here if you need them.
Are you okay?

401
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,090
- Yeah, I'm okay reading.
- I shouldn't be more than an hour.

402
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,140
Was there just company?

403
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,100
It was just Dorothy leaving.

404
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,680
Go on, Caroline.

405
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,900
"On Sundays, the families would come
and visit."

406
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,230
It was Thanksgiving, 1930.

407
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,320
I met the person
who changed my life forever.

408
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,460
Well, Benjamin.

409
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,170
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

410
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,210
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

411
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,590
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow.

412
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,050
What elixir have you been drinking?

413
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,510
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Grandma! Look at me!

414
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,270
That was really something.

415
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,270
Come on over here, you.

416
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,190
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

417
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,980
This is Mr...

418
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,780
I'm afraid, Benjamin,
I don't rightly know your last name.

419
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,530
Benjamin's fine.

420
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,490
I never forgot her blue eyes.

421
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,580
Good people, supper is served.

422
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:48,790
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

423
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,380
Amen.

424
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,710
- Amen!
- Amen!

425
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,970
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

426
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,140
Why do you say that?

427
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,350
They're in the pheasant family,
can't hardly fly.

428
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,980
It's sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

429
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,270
I love birds that can't fly.

430
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,400
They are so delicious.

431
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,990
- That's terrible.
- I have something to tell y'all

432
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,280
while we're giving thanks
for God's blessings.

433
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,320
I had a miracle happen.

434
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,450
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

435
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,460
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

436
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,080
Thanks. Thank you.

437
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,590
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

438
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,510
That's what my mama said
when I was gonna have a baby brother,

439
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,930
but he didn't live long,

440
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,470
'cause he didn't breathe right.

441
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:48,350
"In the afternoon, when he had got
his beautiful hind legs

442
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,070
"just as Big God Nqong had promised.

443
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,110
"You can see that it is 5:00,

444
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:59,200
"because Big God Nqong's
clock says so."

445
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,120
Isn't that something?

446
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,040
Again, read it again.

447
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,450
Oh, read it again, please.

448
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,870
All right.
But afterwards, you must go to bed.

449
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,630
I promise.

450
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,460
"Old Man Kangaroo."

451
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,430
Are you sleeping?

452
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,430
Who's that?

453
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,140
It's me, Daisy.

454
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,640
Oh, hi!

455
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,730
'Kay, come on.

456
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,620
Where are we going?

457
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,580
Come on. Under here.

458
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,550
Here, you light it.

459
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,760
I'm not supposed to play with matches.

460
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,140
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

461
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,150
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.

462
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,690
Okay.

463
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,150
I saw my mama kissing another man.

464
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,620
Her face was red from it.

465
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,370
Your turn.

466
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,960
I'm not as old as I look.

467
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,670
I thought so.

468
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,050
You don't seem like an old person.

469
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,880
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

470
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,260
Are you sick?

471
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,970
Well, I heard Mama
and Tizzy whispering.

472
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,270
They said I was gonna die soon,
but maybe not.

473
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,070
You're odd.

474
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,690
You're different
than anybody I've ever met.

475
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,030
- May I?
- Okay.

476
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,670
What are you doing under there?

477
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,210
You come right out here
and get back up to bed!

478
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,090
It's after midnight!

479
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,300
You are not to be playing together.

480
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,930
Yes, ma'am.

481
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,180
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

482
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,270
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

483
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,770
And you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

484
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,120
You are a different child.

485
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,000
A man-child.

486
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,590
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

487
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,060
What's wrong with me, Mama?

488
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,770
Come here.

489
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,150
God hasn't said yet, baby.

490
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:25,110
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

491
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,990
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

492
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,880
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

493
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,140
Once when I was repairing
a leak on the roof.

494
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,480
Once I was just crossing
the road to get the mail.

495
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,790
I never forgot her...

496
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,410
"...blue eyes."

497
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,460
Mom?

498
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,340
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

499
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,050
Not many people experience that.

500
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,300
Want me to go on?

501
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,310
He crosses something out.

502
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,690
When that baby came,
things were different.

503
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,150
Your mama gone away
And your daddy gonna stay

504
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,070
Didn't leave nobody but the baby

505
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,110
Babies were born, people died.

506
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,870
A lot of folks been through
that old house.

507
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,040
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going away.

508
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,420
Going?

509
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,460
Where?

510
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,130
I haven't figured that out yet,

511
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,670
but I'll send you a postcard
when I get there.

512
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,550
What about your friend, the tall lady?

513
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,050
We are not friends anymore.

514
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,430
That's what happens
with tall people sometimes.

515
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,310
Well, goodbye.

516
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,370
Spent a lot of time by myself that year.

517
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,960
Hello?

518
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,500
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

519
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,420
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

520
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,550
Can you please show her up
to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

521
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,010
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

522
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,100
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

523
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,140
She won't be a bother much longer.

524
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,940
Well, all right,
long as she stays from up underfoot.

525
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,230
Right this way, ma'am.

526
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,480
As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.

527
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,740
Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.

528
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,530
Maybe it was Maple.

529
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,950
It's funny how sometimes
the people we remember the least

530
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,620
make the greatest impression on us.

531
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,540
I do remember she wore diamonds.

532
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,420
And she always dressed in fine
clothing, as if she was going out.

533
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,130
Although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her.

534
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,180
She taught me to play the piano.

535
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,180
It's not about how well you play.

536
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,770
It's how you feel
about what you're playing.

537
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,190
Try this.

538
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,790
You can't help putting yourself
in the music.

539
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
There were many changes.

540
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,060
Some you could see,
some you couldn't.

541
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,020
Hair had started growing
in all sorts of places,

542
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
along with other things.

543
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,570
I felt pretty good, considering.

544
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,280
Darling, the pain.

545
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,910
All right, Mom, I'll get the nurse.

546
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,200
Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane,

547
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,210
a slow hurricane,
with maximum sustained winds of...

548
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,170
Not doing too good?

549
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,300
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

550
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,670
I'm gonna ride it out.

551
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,680
There.
That should make things much easier.

552
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,310
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

553
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:07,890
My father waited four hours for
my brother to get here from Boger City.

554
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,980
Couldn't go without him.

555
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,190
- She seems like a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

556
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,530
I haven't had as much time with her
as I would've...

557
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,530
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

558
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,910
Sure.

559
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,090
"Queenie would let me go
with Mr. Daws..."

560
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:43,010
...to Poverty Point to watch the boats
go up and down the river.

561
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,060
These were hard times.

562
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,810
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

563
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,150
Once when I was in the field,
just tending to my cows.

564
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,950
My fourth hand didn't show up.

565
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,670
Anybody want to make $2
for a day's work 'round here?

566
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,250
What's the matter?

567
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,130
Nobody wants to do an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay?

568
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,800
He never pays.

569
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,550
- Nobody wants a job?
- I do.

570
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,020
You got your sea legs about you,
old man?

571
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,520
I think.

572
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,900
Well, that's good enough for me.

573
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,490
Get your ass on board.
We'll sure as hell find out.

574
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,620
I was as happy as I could be.

575
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,950
I need a volunteer!

576
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,410
I would do anything.

577
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,960
Yes, Captain!

578
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,370
Scrape off all this bird shit!

579
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,790
Right away, sir.

580
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:01,090
And I was actually gonna be paid
for something I would've done for free.

581
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,090
His name was Captain Mike Clark.

582
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,020
He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.

583
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,770
Get moving, then.

584
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,230
Come here.

585
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,400
Can you still get it up?

586
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,740
I do every morning.

587
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,820
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

588
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,740
I guess.

589
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,000
When was the last time
you had a woman?

590
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,420
- Never.
- Never?

591
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,010
Not that I know of, sir.

592
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,260
Wait a minute, now.

593
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,180
You mean to say you've been
on this earth however many years

594
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,600
and you've never had a woman?

595
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,320
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

596
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,030
Never?

597
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,900
No.

598
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:10,620
Well, then, by Jesus,
you are coming with me.

599
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,210
What did your father do?

600
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,380
I never met my father.

601
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,430
You lucky bastard.

602
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,970
All fathers want to do is hold you down.

603
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,980
Out on my father's boat,
workin' the two-a-day,

604
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,730
this little, fat bastard.

605
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,570
"Tug Irish," they called him.

606
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:45,030
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve
and tell him,

607
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,620
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life
on a goddamn tugboat."

608
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,700
You know what I'm saying?

609
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,750
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life on a tugboat.

610
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,170
Absolutely! Damn right!

611
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,550
So you know
what my father says to me?

612
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,800
He says,
"Who the hell do you think you are?

613
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,680
"What the hell do you think you can do?"

614
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,640
So I tell him.

615
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,480
"Well, if you're asking,

616
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,770
"I want to be an artist."

617
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,230
He laughs.

618
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:28,740
"An artist? God meant for you
to work a tugboat, just like me.

619
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,450
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do."

620
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,830
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

621
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,040
A tattoo artist!

622
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,250
I put on every one of these myself.

623
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,590
You have to skin me alive
to take my art away from me now.

624
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,890
When I'm dead,
I'm gonna send him my arm.

625
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,560
That one.

626
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,520
Don't let anyone tell you different.

627
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,230
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

628
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,440
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

629
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,360
But you're a tugboat captain.

630
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,660
Captain Mike?

631
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,540
We're ready for you and your friend.

632
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:21,290
Let's go, old timer, eh?
Break your cherry.

633
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,210
- Hello, my lovelies!
- Hey, Captain.

634
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,300
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

635
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,550
- Hi.
- Hi.

636
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,720
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

637
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,930
How are you tonight, grandpa?

638
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,730
It was a night to remember.

639
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,110
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I've got to rest.

640
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,490
Again.

641
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,120
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

642
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,370
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

643
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:01,160
It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.

644
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,620
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

645
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,960
Things money can buy you.

646
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,310
It's nasty out.

647
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:28,650
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

648
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,700
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.

649
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,500
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

650
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,290
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

651
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,670
It's a pleasure to know you.

652
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,430
Would you like to stop somewhere
and have a drink?

653
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,930
All right.

654
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,510
Evening, Mr. Button.

655
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,020
What'll it be, sir?

656
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,780
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Sazerac for the both of us.

657
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,240
With whiskey, not brandy.

658
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,820
You don't drink, do you?

659
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,530
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

660
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,700
I've never been to a brothel, either.

661
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,580
Well, it's an experience.

662
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,790
It certainly is.
There's a time for everything.

663
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,330
- True enough.
- Your drinks.

664
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,220
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands.
Is that painful?

665
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,140
Well, I was born
with some form of disease.

666
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,800
What kind of disease?

667
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,680
I was born old.

668
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,890
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

669
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,560
There's nothing wrong with old age.

670
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,450
My wife passed away many years ago.

671
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:02,700
I'm so, so sorry.

672
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,040
She died in childbirth.

673
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,090
- To children.
- To mothers.

674
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,180
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

675
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,430
Buttons. Button's Buttons.
There isn't a button that we don't make.

676
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,980
Our biggest competition
is B. F. Goodrich

677
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,810
and his infernal zippers.

678
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,690
Would you gentlemen like
anything else?

679
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,860
One for the road, Benjamin?

680
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,780
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

681
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,530
So, what line of work do you do?

682
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,410
I'm a tugboat man.

683
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,630
I enjoyed talking to you.

684
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,260
I enjoyed drinking with you.

685
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,220
Benjamin?

686
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,760
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

687
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:08,310
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

688
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,600
Good night, Benjamin.

689
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,690
Drive on.

690
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,700
Where have you been?

691
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:24,830
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to some music.

692
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,790
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

693
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,880
Growing up's a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.

694
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,170
One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.

695
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,430
She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.

696
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,220
Benjamin! Come on!

697
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:44,970
Okay.

698
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,770
I loved those weekends
when she'd come

699
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,680
and spend the night
with her grandmother.

700
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,240
Daisy. Daisy.

701
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,570
You want to see something?

702
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:10,540
You gotta keep it a secret,
so get dressed. I'll meet you out back.

703
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,420
Come on.

704
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,340
- Can you swim?
- I can do anything you can do.

705
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,050
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

706
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,530
Is he okay?

707
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,070
Captain?

708
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,240
Captain Mike?

709
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,660
Morning, Captain. Can you take us out?

710
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,120
Do you know what day it is?

711
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:55,500
Sunday?

712
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,750
Do you know what that means?

713
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,460
Means I was very drunk last night.

714
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,340
Well, you're drunk every night.

715
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,100
- Is that a girl?
- Close friend.

716
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,890
I want to show her the river.

717
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:14,310
You're not supposed to go joyriding
with civilians.

718
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,610
I could lose my license.

719
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,910
What are you waiting for?

720
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,190
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck.

721
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,780
She's flying now, huh?

722
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,950
Ahoy, sailor!

723
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:14,830
I wish we could go with them.

724
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,130
Did you say something, Mom?

725
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,850
It's getting really bad.

726
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,680
Can you hear me, Mom?

727
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:41,980
Time just seeped out of me.

728
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,530
"Things were changing quickly."

729
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,740
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

730
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,250
What if I told you
that I wasn't getting older,

731
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:02,630
but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

732
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:06,630
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

733
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,590
to have to see everybody you love
die before you do.

734
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,590
It's an awful responsibility.

735
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,260
I'd never thought about life or death
that way before.

736
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:20,980
Benjamin, we're meant
to lose the people we love.

737
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,820
How else would we know
how important they are to us?

738
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,410
And one fall day, a familiar visitor
came knocking on our door.

739
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,910
You want to go with me
to the drugstore?

740
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,420
She taught me how to play the piano.

741
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,800
- Amen.
- Amen.

742
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,090
And she taught me
what it meant to miss somebody.

743
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,100
Let's go.

744
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,020
I had gone to a brothel.

745
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,440
I'd had my first drink.

746
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,030
Said goodbye to one friend
and buried another.

747
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:14,410
In 1936, when I was coming to the end
of the 17th year of my life,

748
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,370
I packed my bag, said goodbye.

749
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,790
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

750
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:24,380
I knew, life being what it was,
I'd probably never see them again.

751
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,210
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

752
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,800
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

753
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,220
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

754
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,640
I want you to say your prayers
every night, hear?

755
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,570
Be safe, hear?

756
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,330
Benjamin!

757
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,090
- Where you going?
- To sea.

758
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,550
I'll send you a postcard.

759
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,300
From everywhere.

760
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,010
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

761
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,400
Can you imagine?

762
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:42,910
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

763
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,460
Every place he worked.

764
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,880
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

765
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,550
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

766
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:00,050
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

767
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,310
Captain Mike had contracted
for three years

768
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:06,730
with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.

769
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:10,690
The old ship had been refitted with
a diesel engine and a new sea winch.

770
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,690
We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.

771
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,200
We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me.

772
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,660
Cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.

773
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,160
The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,

774
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,500
who got along fine at sea
but, for some reason,

775
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,670
once they were on dry land
couldn't stand the sight of each other.

776
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,340
You know, one in every
eight boats never returns.

777
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,550
There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.

778
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,510
All hands lost at sea.

779
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,840
From Belvedere, South Dakota.

780
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,060
And Pleasant Curtis
from Asheville, Notch.

781
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,350
Never said a word to anyone,
except himself.

782
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,360
I wrote him constantly.

783
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,990
I told him I had been invited to
audition in New York City

784
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,200
for the School of American Ballet.

785
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,700
Please stay.

786
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,950
Thank you. Thank you.

787
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,210
You can stay.

788
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:13,790
But I was relegated to the corps.

789
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,460
Another dancing gypsy.

790
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,300
Benjamin!

791
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:25,390
How is it when you showed up

792
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:29,390
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

793
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,690
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

794
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,610
or you sprouted?

795
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,280
What's your secret?

796
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,280
Well, Captain,

797
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,870
you do drink a lot.

798
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,920
We stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name, The Winter Palace.

799
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,800
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

800
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,380
The hummingbird
is not just another bird.

801
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:05,850
Its heart rate's 1,200 beats per minute.

802
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,310
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

803
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:15,230
If you was to stop their wings
from beating,

804
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,690
it would be dead
in less than 10 seconds.

805
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,360
This is no ordinary bird.

806
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,160
This is a frickin' miracle.

807
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:32,210
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

808
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,080
and you know what they saw?

809
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,380
Their wingtips are doing that.

810
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,260
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

811
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,810
Infinity.

812
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,230
Infinity!

813
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,650
Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,

814
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:02,780
the languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common.

815
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,070
They were drunk every single night.

816
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,700
Three, please.

817
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,410
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

818
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,790
Thank you very much. Good evening.

819
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:14,580
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.

820
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:18,000
She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.

821
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:20,920
But she was pretty as any picture to me.

822
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,260
What are you looking at?

823
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:29,010
If you must know,
we have a longstanding agreement

824
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,470
never to go to bed sober.

825
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,970
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

826
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,140
Her husband was Walter Abbott.

827
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:39,150
He was Chief Minister of
the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,

828
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,860
and he was a spy.

829
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,860
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

830
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,990
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

831
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:53,540
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

832
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:57,250
I'm not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet.

833
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,800
They were long days there.

834
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,310
And even longer nights.

835
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,060
One particular night,
I was having trouble sleeping.

836
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,020
I'm sorry.

837
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,650
I couldn't sleep.

838
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,000
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

839
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,760
Oh, no. Thank you.

840
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,170
Milk? Honey?

841
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,710
A bit of honey, please.

842
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,010
I hope you like flies in your honey.

843
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:30,800
Oh, perhaps not.

844
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:49,900
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.

845
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,070
Steep?

846
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:53,530
Soak.

847
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:57,450
I don't know, I mean,
there's a proper way of making tea.

848
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,790
Well, where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

849
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:03,000
Well, quite right.

850
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,300
- Now, you're a seaman.
- A sailor.

851
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:17,140
I hope you won't think me impolite,
but I have to ask,

852
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,350
aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

853
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,890
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

854
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,990
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

855
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,290
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

856
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,710
Something's been keeping me up.

857
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,130
My father, in his 80s,

858
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:48,500
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep,

859
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:52,300
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps.

860
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:55,800
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

861
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,850
- Did he?
- Did he what?

862
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:00,640
Die in his sleep?

863
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,900
He died sitting in his favorite chair

864
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,650
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless.

865
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,230
He must have known something.

866
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:21,040
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 14 months.

867
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,460
- Good God.
- We were supposed to go to Peking

868
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:28,040
but it never seemed to work out.

869
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,210
Have you been in the Far East?

870
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,510
No. I've never been anywhere, really.

871
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:36,050
I mean, outside of harbors.

872
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,800
And where is it that you're from?

873
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,430
New Orleans. Louisiana.

874
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,230
I didn't know there was another.

875
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:51,570
And she told me about all the places
she had been, and what she had seen.

876
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:56,070
And we talked till just before the dawn.

877
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:58,570
I'm just a lush, myself.

878
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:03,620
And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.

879
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,380
But every night,
we'd meet again in that lobby.

880
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,600
A hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place.

881
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:27,390
A mouse running, and stopping.

882
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:30,900
A radiator hissing.

883
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,780
A curtain blowing.

884
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:40,910
There's something peaceful,
even comforting

885
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,240
knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds

886
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,580
where nothing can harm them.

887
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:52,630
Elizabeth and I would lose track
of the night

888
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:55,340
until just before daybreak.

889
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,720
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

890
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,350
Beg pardon?

891
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:06,270
Well, married women don't customarily
sit around

892
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:08,390
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

893
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,060
I wouldn't know what a married woman
does or doesn't do.

894
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,280
Good night.

895
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,910
Murmansk.

896
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:28,580
"I've met somebody,
and I've fallen in love."

897
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:29,910
Mom?

898
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,300
That was over 60 years ago.

899
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:38,590
Did you love him, Mother?

900
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:41,470
What does a girl know about love?

901
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,290
Well...

902
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,550
- I'm not dressed.
- Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

903
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,890
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

904
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:31,020
'cause they're really
completely ordinary,

905
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:36,110
but the caviar and the vodka

906
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:40,780
are sublime and plentiful.

907
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:45,870
So.

908
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,460
Savor it.

909
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,540
And don't eat it all at once,

910
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,750
because that way,
there's nothing left to enjoy.

911
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:05,760
And now, take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

912
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:23,490
You haven't been with many women,
have you?

913
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,320
Not on Sundays.

914
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,240
And you've never had caviar before,
have you?

915
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,000
No, ma'am.

916
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,500
When I was 19,

917
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:46,760
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

918
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,180
Really?

919
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,850
But the current that day
was so strong that,

920
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:56,060
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

921
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,270
I was in the water for 32 hours.

922
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:04,070
And when I was two miles from Calais,

923
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:06,950
it started to rain.

924
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,570
That's it! Steady on!

925
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,740
When I couldn't go any further,

926
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:15,790
I stopped.

927
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,790
I just stopped.

928
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:24,260
And everybody asked me,
would I try again?

929
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,840
For why wouldn't I?

930
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,470
But I never did.

931
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:37,140
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

932
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,320
Your hands are so coarse.

933
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:56,200
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

934
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,510
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.

935
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,640
It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.

936
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,600
It's something you never forget.

937
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:30,110
I think you make me feel younger.

938
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,780
You make me feel years younger, too.

939
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:34,490
I wish I was.

940
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,620
So many things I'd change.

941
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:40,620
I'd undo all my mistakes.

942
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,460
What mistakes?

943
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,960
I kept waiting, you know?

944
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:53,090
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

945
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:56,100
Do something.

946
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,890
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

947
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,850
Wasted time.

948
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:11,570
If we're going to have an affair,

949
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,120
you're never to look at me
during the day.

950
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:18,700
And we're always to part before sunrise.

951
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:22,000
And we will never say "I love you."

952
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,420
Those are the rules.

953
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,170
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

954
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:32,220
Oh, you! You're frozen.

955
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:35,550
What an idiot, I'm standing here
in this fur. How thoughtless of me.

956
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:12,010
She was the first woman
that ever loved me.

957
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:16,220
You want me to skip some?

958
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:22,100
No, I'm glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

959
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:28,230
"I couldn't wait to see her again."

960
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,450
We saw each other every night.

961
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,330
We always used the same room.

962
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:51,670
But each time seemed new
and different.

963
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,510
Come here.

964
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,350
Elizabeth.

965
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,140
Good night.

966
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:10,480
Until one night.

967
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:53,320
Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,

968
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,530
a date which will live in infamy...

969
01:14:56,610 --> 01:15:00,780
It's a meeting, a policy meeting
regarding your future,

970
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,280
possibly beyond.

971
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,250
There's been a change of plan, lads.

972
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:10,040
As you may or may not know,

973
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,750
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

974
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,670
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked
each of us to do our part.

975
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:21,260
The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.

976
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,970
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

977
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,850
Anybody doesn't want to go to war,
now is the time to say so.

978
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,150
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

979
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,410
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

980
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:43,530
My wife's doing poorly.

981
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:46,370
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.

982
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,920
You're free to make your way home
any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

983
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:59,300
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

984
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:03,470
Food poisoning's one of the leading
causes of death at sea.

985
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:05,930
Right after
inadequate safety equipment.

986
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:08,680
I can cook, Captain.
Been doing it all my life.

987
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:13,190
I don't know.
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

988
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,230
What the hell?

989
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,690
I'll take any man wants to kick the shite
out of the Japs and the Huns.

990
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:24,870
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

991
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:33,500
She had left a note.

992
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,630
She wrote,
"It was nice to have met you."

993
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,010
And that was it.

994
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:46,260
It wasn't the war any of us expected.

995
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:50,020
We would just tow crippled ships,
scraps of metal, really.

996
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,600
If there was a war, we didn't see it.

997
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,570
There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.

998
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,860
But most of all, he loved America.

999
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,860
There is no other country in the world.

1000
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:06,070
When you spell America...

1001
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,330
His name was Dennis Smith,
and he was a full-blooded Cherokee.

1002
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:13,540
His family had been Americans
for over 500 years.

1003
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:18,170
These pacifists.
They say they won't fight on conscience.

1004
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:21,880
Now, where would be
if everybody decided to act

1005
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,970
- according to their conscience?
- Keep it down, would you, Chief?

1006
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,700
Hey. I've been watching you.

1007
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,530
You seem trustworthy.

1008
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:52,410
If something happens to me,

1009
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:59,040
could you see that this gets to my wife?

1010
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:03,710
He'd given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.

1011
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:08,890
I want my family to know
I was thinking about them.

1012
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,480
All hands on deck!

1013
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:20,770
Get your asses up here,
you lazy bastards!

1014
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,300
The war had finally found us.

1015
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,470
All stop!

1016
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,180
Pleasant, man that light.

1017
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:05,230
A transport carrying 1,300 men
had been split by a torpedo.

1018
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:09,910
We were first to arrive at the scene.

1019
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:13,580
- Cut the engines!
- All stop!

1020
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,620
We were the only sound.

1021
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:35,970
Fellas!

1022
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,030
Sub!

1023
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:54,620
We sure as hell
can't outrun them fuckers.

1024
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:58,660
Battle stations!

1025
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:09,550
Thank you, Chief.

1026
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,930
What?

1027
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,730
Is that the last one?

1028
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,570
Captain!

1029
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:08,830
They shot the hell out of my painting!

1030
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:11,960
Give me your other hand.

1031
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,340
You'll be all right, Captain.

1032
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:22,720
They got a nice spot in Heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

1033
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:27,310
You can be as mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1034
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:33,980
You could swear, curse the Fates.

1035
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,410
But when it comes to the end,

1036
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:42,370
you have to let go.

1037
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:50,580
Captain?

1038
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,730
Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men
died that day.

1039
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:20,280
I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee,
Dennis Smith.

1040
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,450
John Grimm, who was right,
he was gonna die there.

1041
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:28,660
I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money.

1042
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:32,540
I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,

1043
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:37,340
and to Mike Clark,
captain of the tugboat Chelsea.

1044
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,260
I said goodbye to all the other men
who had dreams of their own,

1045
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:46,930
all the men
who wanted to be insurance salesmen

1046
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,980
or doctors or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

1047
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,860
This don't get fixed.

1048
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:58,030
Out here, death didn't seem natural.

1049
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,210
I'd never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.

1050
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,340
Before or since.

1051
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:33,440
And in May of 1945,
when I was 26 years old,

1052
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,650
I came home.

1053
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,190
I'm ready! I'm ready!

1054
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,650
I'm coming!

1055
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:44,200
- I'm ready!
- All right, I'm coming, Miss Alfalina.

1056
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,820
- Queenie?
- Yes?

1057
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:57,590
Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home!
Oh, Lord, you came back!

1058
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,420
- Let me look at you.
- Who's that, Mama?

1059
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:03,760
- Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
- I didn't know he was my brother.

1060
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,550
There's a shitload of things
you don't know, child.

1061
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,800
Get on out there and finish sweeping.

1062
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:09,100
Come here, wash your hands,
help me with the table. Go on, now.

1063
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:13,100
Turn around.
You look like you've been born again.

1064
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:15,440
Younger than the springtime.

1065
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,190
I think that preacher laid hands on you
gave you a second life.

1066
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,950
I knew it that moment I saw you,
you were special.

1067
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:24,910
I tell you what, my knees are sore,

1068
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:27,530
'cause I've been on them every night
asking the Lord,

1069
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:31,370
I said,
"God, just bring him home safely."

1070
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,960
Remember what I told you?

1071
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,710
"You never know
what's coming for you?"

1072
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,710
That's right. Sit down.

1073
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:43,220
Well, you learn anything
worth repeating?

1074
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:49,560
- I sure saw some things.
- Oh, you seen some pain.

1075
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:53,810
- Some joy, too?
- Sure. Sure, I did.

1076
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:58,060
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
Look at you.

1077
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:01,690
- Where's Tizzy?
- Oh, baby.

1078
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:07,990
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep
one night last April.

1079
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:11,580
- Mama, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you worry about that, baby.

1080
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:15,960
Yeah, well, it's only
one or two of them left now.

1081
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,500
They all just about new.

1082
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:21,500
Guess they're waiting their turn
like everybody else, huh?

1083
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:24,340
I'm so glad you're back home with me!

1084
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:27,590
Now, we're gonna have to find you
a wife and a new job! That's right.

1085
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,600
Come on in here,
help me with this table.

1086
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,350
Benjamin.

1087
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:37,560
You're wasting your time, baby.
She's stone deaf.

1088
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:41,690
Oh, and you'll be staying in
what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room.

1089
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:44,740
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

1090
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,450
It's a funny thing about coming home.

1091
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:55,910
Looks the same,
smells the same, feels the same.

1092
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,460
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

1093
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:07,510
Once when I was sitting in my truck,
just minding my own business.

1094
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:16,810
You realize what's changed is you.

1095
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:23,520
And late one morning,
not long after I'd been back...

1096
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,280
Thank you.

1097
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,420
Hey.

1098
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:56,850
- Excuse me, is Queenie here?
- Daisy?

1099
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,230
- It's me, Benjamin.
- Benjamin?

1100
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:09,950
Oh, my God!

1101
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:15,160
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

1102
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:20,120
How are you?
It's been such a long time.

1103
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:22,960
There's so much I want to know.
When did you get back?

1104
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,460
Well, I got back a few weeks ago.

1105
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:28,550
I spoke to Queenie, she said you were
in the war, somewhere at sea.

1106
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:32,380
- We were so, so worried about you.
- Oh, I'm okay.

1107
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:36,390
Well, look at you. You're so lovely.

1108
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:39,930
You stopped writing.

1109
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:47,150
"When I had left, she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

1110
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,650
"She was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen."

1111
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,070
Beautiful.

1112
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,070
"The most beautiful."

1113
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,620
- You remember Grandma Fuller?
- Why, sure I do.

1114
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:02,790
- She passed.
- I heard that. I'm sorry.

1115
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:07,500
I just can't believe we're both here.
Must be fate.

1116
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:09,550
No, no, what do they call it?

1117
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:11,050
Kismet.

1118
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:13,050
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic?

1119
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:14,180
I don't believe I...

1120
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:17,140
He says
that everything is predetermined,

1121
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,600
but I like to think of it as fate.

1122
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:27,020
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

1123
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:30,730
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

1124
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:32,990
Now, I can see
the Empire State Building

1125
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:34,860
if I stand on my bed.

1126
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,950
What about you?
Where have you been?

1127
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:40,660
Tell me everything. Last time you wrote,
you said you'd been to Russia.

1128
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:44,920
I've always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

1129
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,790
- Twice as cold.
- My goodness.

1130
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:53,090
We always said you were different.
But I think you really are.

1131
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:58,720
You wrote that you met somebody.
Did it work out?

1132
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,890
It ran its course.

1133
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,310
Hey, do you remember this?

1134
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,910
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1135
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:20,120
"at 5:00 in the afternoon."

1136
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:24,160
Would you like to have dinner?

1137
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:34,550
Did I tell you
that I danced for Balanchine?

1138
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:39,760
Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.

1139
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:46,020
You know, in a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.

1140
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:48,940
And he just...
He just put it right into the production.

1141
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:52,520
I mean, can you imagine that?
Like in a... In a classical ballet?

1142
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:55,860
You know, a dancer,
intentionally falling.

1143
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:59,610
There's a whole new word
for dance now. It's called "abstract."

1144
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,030
No, he's not the only one, though.

1145
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,040
There's Lincoln Kirstein
and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...

1146
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,620
Oh, there's Agnes de Mille.

1147
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:09,790
She's just torn up all those conventions,

1148
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,880
you know,
all that straight-up-and-down stuff.

1149
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,170
It's not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.

1150
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:17,970
As she told me
about this big new world,

1151
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:20,590
names that didn't mean a thing to me,

1152
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,760
I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.

1153
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:25,100
It's new and it's modern
and it's American.

1154
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:28,350
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

1155
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,600
Oh, my God.
I've just been talking and talking.

1156
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:35,190
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.
I didn't know you smoked.

1157
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,860
I'm old enough.

1158
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,740
I'm old enough for a lot of things.

1159
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:48,080
In New York, we stay up all night,

1160
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:52,170
watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

1161
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,800
There's always something to do.

1162
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,610
I have to go back tomorrow.

1163
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,900
- So soon.
- Wish I could stay.

1164
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:27,870
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

1165
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:31,500
I can imagine
dancing completely naked.

1166
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:35,170
Have you read D. H. Lawrence?

1167
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,380
- Well...
- His books were banned.

1168
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:41,010
The words are like making love.

1169
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:30,140
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

1170
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:39,110
Sex is a part of it.

1171
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:46,410
You know,
a lot of the dancers are lesbians.

1172
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:51,660
There was one woman
who wanted to sleep with me.

1173
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,960
- Does that upset you?
- Which part?

1174
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:05,510
Somebody wanting to sleep with me.

1175
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:07,180
You're a desirable woman.

1176
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:11,010
I would think most of them
would want to sleep with you.

1177
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,220
Let's go back to the house.

1178
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:16,560
Or we could get a room somewhere.

1179
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,730
- We could lay down your jacket.
- I don't know, Daisy.

1180
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:28,200
It's not that I wouldn't like to or anything.
I think I'll just disappoint you.

1181
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,200
Oh, Benjamin, I've been with older men.

1182
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:35,000
You're going back to New York
in the morning.

1183
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:37,420
You should be with your friends.

1184
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,920
- You're only young once.
- Oh, I'm old enough.

1185
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,630
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1186
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,310
We could go hear some music.

1187
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:04,280
Our lives are defined by opportunities.

1188
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:07,110
Even the ones we miss.

1189
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:11,620
You look so handsome
and so distinguished.

1190
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:13,870
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow right on by.

1191
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:18,580
- Oh, that's great.
- I'll stay under the blankets with Mother.

1192
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:22,790
She says nothing... Benjamin?

1193
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:25,760
"Things were becoming different..."

1194
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,050
...for me.

1195
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:30,720
My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.

1196
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,600
My sense of smell was keener.
My hearing, more acute.

1197
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,350
I could walk further and faster.

1198
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:43,230
While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger, all alone.

1199
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,490
Come in.

1200
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:50,200
Benjamin.

1201
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:54,410
- Do you remember me?
- Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

1202
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,660
- What happened to you?
- Darn foot. Got infected, so...

1203
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:01,580
Welcome home, my friend.

1204
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:07,380
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1205
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,720
Creature of habit.

1206
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,930
You still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

1207
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:12,760
Not for a long time.

1208
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,430
Interesting times, though.

1209
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:20,980
We went from making 40,000
to nearly half a million buttons a day.

1210
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,100
We employed 10 times
the number of people.

1211
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:25,690
We were operating around the clock.

1212
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,650
Damn shame.

1213
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:35,700
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1214
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:39,790
You know,

1215
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:45,380
I'm sick.
I don't know how much longer I have.

1216
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:48,340
- I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.
- No...

1217
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,800
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1218
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:58,310
I hope you don't mind,
but, whenever possible,

1219
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:00,390
I'd enjoy your company.

1220
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,020
I'll certainly do what I can.

1221
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:09,230
Benjamin, do you know anything
about buttons?

1222
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:17,450
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1223
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:22,710
My grandfather was a tailor,
and he had a small shop in Richmond.

1224
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:25,210
After the Civil War,
he moved to New Orleans,

1225
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:30,340
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1226
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:35,340
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

1227
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:38,680
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1228
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:45,230
That's very, very interesting.

1229
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:51,280
You sure have done well for yourself.

1230
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:56,280
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button?

1231
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:01,830
Benjamin? You're my son.

1232
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:12,010
I'm so sorry I never told you before.

1233
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:17,550
You were born
the night the Great War ended.

1234
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:23,140
Your mother died giving birth to you.

1235
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,850
I thought you were a monster.

1236
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,690
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

1237
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:42,580
I should never have abandoned you.

1238
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:48,040
My mother?

1239
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:52,340
At the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1240
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:55,880
When I was a boy,
I'd love to wake up before anyone else,

1241
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:59,010
run down to that lake
and watch the day begin.

1242
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:03,310
It was as if I was the only one alive.

1243
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,850
I fell in love the first time I saw her.

1244
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:11,020
Your mother's name
was Caroline Murphy.

1245
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:14,530
She worked
in your grandfather's kitchen.

1246
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:19,490
She's from Dublin.

1247
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:24,540
In 1903, Caroline and all her brothers
and sisters came to live here,

1248
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:26,200
in New Orleans.

1249
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:31,170
I'd find excuses
to go down to that kitchen

1250
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:34,130
just so I could look at her.

1251
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:44,220
April 25th, 1918.
Happiest day of my life.

1252
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:47,230
The day I married your mother.

1253
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:51,100
Why didn't you just tell me?

1254
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:54,820
I plan on leaving everything I have
to you.

1255
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,780
- I have to go.
- Where?

1256
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,240
Home.

1257
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:03,240
And what does he think, anyway?

1258
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:04,660
He thinks he can just show up

1259
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:06,620
and everything's
supposed to be fine and dandy.

1260
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:09,330
Everybody's just supposed to be friends.

1261
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,330
Well, he got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1262
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:15,840
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming.

1263
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,010
He left us $18 that night you was found.

1264
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:20,930
Eighteen ratty dollars

1265
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:22,760
- and a filthy diaper.
- Good night, Mama.

1266
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:25,300
Good night, baby.

1267
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:42,950
Did I ever tell you
I was struck by lightning seven times?

1268
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,780
Once, I was walking my dog
down the road.

1269
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:55,630
I'm blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear,

1270
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:01,470
get twitches and shakes out of nowhere,
always losing my line of thought.

1271
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:04,720
But you know what?

1272
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:08,430
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1273
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:15,730
Storm's coming.

1274
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:45,890
May I help you, sir?
Up the stairs, first bedroom.

1275
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:47,050
Thank you.

1276
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,200
Wake up.

1277
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,570
Let's get you dressed.

1278
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,650
Now that's something.

1279
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,280
Thank you.

1280
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:46,380
You can be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1281
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,930
You can swear and curse the Fates.

1282
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:52,720
But when it comes to the end,

1283
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:55,680
you have to let go.

1284
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:20,290
Well, it sure is a beautiful service.

1285
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:24,960
He'll be buried
right next to your mother.

1286
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:28,050
You're my mother.

1287
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,140
My baby.

1288
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,850
Now, I'd never seen New York.

1289
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:11,440
- Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daisy's.
- Right this way.

1290
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:17,820
- Daisy has company. Daisy! Daisy!
- Yes!

1291
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:21,490
- We need the wardrobe.
- Is somebody looking for me?

1292
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,290
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1293
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:31,380
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd come visit.

1294
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:34,920
Spend some time with you, if I could.

1295
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:40,930
Oh, well, I wish you would've called.
You took me by surprise.

1296
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:46,440
- You can just throw them out.
- No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1297
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:51,860
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1298
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:56,700
Thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

1299
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:04,080
I better get changed.
A group of us are going to a party.

1300
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:07,420
- Would you want to come?
- Someone told me about a restaurant

1301
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,790
I thought you might enjoy.

1302
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,420
I made a reservation, just in case.

1303
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:14,510
Just, all the dancers go out
after the show. You're...

1304
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:18,430
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed. All right?

1305
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:26,980
She choreographs
for the Ballets Russes.

1306
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:28,390
She's divine.

1307
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:30,860
You were breathtaking.

1308
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:37,820
Sweetie.

1309
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:41,870
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1310
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:44,870
- This is Benjamin.
- Who?

1311
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:48,210
- I told you about him.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing?

1312
01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:51,790
- I'll go get you a drink.
- All right. Thanks.

1313
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:02,640
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1314
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:04,680
Or something like that?

1315
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:07,600
Something like that.

1316
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:09,480
Hey, excuse me.

1317
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:33,080
Come on.

1318
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,480
Hey!

1319
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,940
Now, I had no idea you were coming.

1320
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:01,530
Lord, Benjamin.

1321
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:07,990
What did you expect?
What, you want me to drop everything?

1322
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,040
Now, this is my life.

1323
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:12,620
Babe! You going downtown?

1324
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:20,670
Come on. You'll have a good time.

1325
01:49:21,510 --> 01:49:23,050
There's lots of musicians,
interesting people.

1326
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:26,050
You don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

1327
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:28,560
I should've called.

1328
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,480
I thought I'd come here

1329
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:34,310
and sweep you off your feet
or something.

1330
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:40,320
- Daisy! Come on! Let's go.
- Be right there.

1331
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:43,490
Seems nice.

1332
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:46,450
Do you love him?

1333
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:50,950
I think so.

1334
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,750
I'm happy for you.

1335
01:49:56,670 --> 01:49:58,790
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1336
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:02,510
Okay.

1337
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:06,300
I enjoyed the show!

1338
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:18,440
He came to tell me his father had died.

1339
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:26,110
- You couldn't have known.
- I was 23. I... I just didn't care.

1340
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:30,030
What did you do next?

1341
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:37,080
Some photographs, I think,
in the front of my bag.

1342
01:50:39,170 --> 01:50:43,300
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1343
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,130
For five years, I...

1344
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:51,680
I danced everywhere.

1345
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:56,640
London, Vienna, Prague.

1346
01:50:57,230 --> 01:50:59,100
I've never seen these.

1347
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,530
Mom.

1348
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:07,490
You never talked about your dancing.

1349
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:09,620
Well, I was the only American

1350
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:14,660
to be invited to dance
with the Bolshoi, sugar.

1351
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:18,540
It was glorious.

1352
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,720
But Benjamin was never far
from my thoughts.

1353
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:33,430
And I'd find myself saying...

1354
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,350
Good night, Benjamin.

1355
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:40,980
- "Good night, Daisy."
- He said that?

1356
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:44,270
"Life wasn't all that complicated.

1357
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:47,950
"If you want, you might say
I was looking for something."

1358
01:51:57,410 --> 01:52:00,420
Benjamin?
Mrs. La Tourneau just passed.

1359
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,470
- Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?
- That'd be me.

1360
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:14,720
Thank you.

1361
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,920
Miss Daisy Fuller.

1362
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,840
- Just a minute. Please have a seat.
- Sure.

1363
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:57,720
Sometimes we're on a collision course
and we just don't know it.

1364
01:52:58,270 --> 01:53:02,810
Whether it's by accident or by design,
there's not a thing we can do about it.

1365
01:53:05,610 --> 01:53:08,690
A woman in Paris was on her way
to go shopping.

1366
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:13,780
But she had forgotten her coat,
went back to get it.

1367
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:16,070
When she had gotten her coat,
the phone had rung.

1368
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:19,200
So she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.

1369
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:22,460
While the woman was on the phone,

1370
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:26,750
Daisy was rehearsing for a performance
at the Paris Opera House.

1371
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:29,630
And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,

1372
01:53:29,710 --> 01:53:32,050
had gone outside to get a taxi.

1373
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:38,850
Now, a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,

1374
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:41,680
and had stopped to get a cup of coffee.

1375
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,310
And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.

1376
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:51,320
And this cab driver,
who dropped off the earlier fare

1377
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,400
and had stopped
to get the cup of coffee,

1378
01:53:53,490 --> 01:53:55,200
he picked up the lady
who was going shopping

1379
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,030
and had missed getting the earlier cab.

1380
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:01,370
The taxi had to stop
for a man crossing the street,

1381
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:04,290
who had left for work five minutes later
than he normally did

1382
01:54:04,370 --> 01:54:06,920
because he forgot to set his alarm.

1383
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:10,960
While that man, late for work,
was crossing the street,

1384
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:14,510
Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.

1385
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:16,340
And while Daisy was showering,

1386
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:20,060
the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package

1387
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:21,270
which hadn't been wrapped yet,

1388
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:23,180
because the girl
who was supposed to wrap it

1389
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:26,900
had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.

1390
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,730
When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,

1391
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:32,480
was blocked by a delivery truck.

1392
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:35,320
All the while,
Daisy was getting dressed.

1393
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:40,200
The delivery truck pulled away,
and the taxi was able to move

1394
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,370
while Daisy, the last to be dressed,

1395
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:46,040
waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.

1396
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:49,380
While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,

1397
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:53,380
Daisy and her friend
came out the back of the theater.

1398
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:56,880
And if only one thing
had happened differently,

1399
01:54:56,970 --> 01:54:59,050
if that shoelace hadn't broken

1400
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:01,680
or that delivery truck
had moved moments earlier

1401
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,640
or that package
had been wrapped and ready

1402
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:06,480
because the girl hadn't broken up
with her boyfriend,

1403
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,230
or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier

1404
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,530
or that taxi driver hadn't stopped
for a cup of coffee

1405
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:17,650
or that woman had remembered
her coat and got into an earlier cab,

1406
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:20,870
Daisy and her friend
would have crossed the street

1407
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:23,410
and the taxi would have driven by.

1408
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:36,210
But, life being what it is,

1409
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:39,300
a series of intersecting lives
and incidents

1410
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:41,180
out of anyone's control,

1411
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:44,770
that taxi did not go by,

1412
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:47,680
and that driver was
momentarily distracted.

1413
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:49,690
Daisy!

1414
01:55:49,850 --> 01:55:51,100
And that taxi hit Daisy.

1415
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:52,940
Daisy! Help!

1416
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:58,070
And her leg was crushed.

1417
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:06,660
Daisy?

1418
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:13,500
- Who told you?
- Your friend wired me.

1419
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:18,630
Very kind of you to come all this way
to see that I was all right.

1420
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:22,220
You'd do the same for me.

1421
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:25,350
My God.

1422
01:56:27,430 --> 01:56:30,940
Look at you. You're perfect.

1423
01:56:33,730 --> 01:56:38,280
I wish you hadn't come here.
I don't want you to see me like this.

1424
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:46,990
Her leg had been broken in five places.

1425
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:50,250
And with therapy and time,
she might walk again.

1426
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:53,670
But she'd never dance.

1427
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:57,710
I'm gonna take you home with me.

1428
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:00,590
- I want to look after you.
- I'm not going back to New Orleans.

1429
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,880
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1430
01:57:03,470 --> 01:57:06,430
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1431
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:11,850
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

1432
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:15,730
Tried to tell you that in New York.
You don't listen.

1433
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:19,190
You might change your mind.

1434
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:22,280
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1435
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:27,530
Just stay out of my life.

1436
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:53,640
I was awfully cruel.

1437
01:57:54,690 --> 01:58:00,150
He didn't understand.
I couldn't have him see me like that.

1438
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:04,200
"I didn't leave right away.

1439
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:10,160
"I stayed in Paris for a while
to look out for her."

1440
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:15,580
I never knew that.

1441
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,050
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse?

1442
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:31,850
I taught myself to walk again.

1443
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:37,480
I took the train to Lourdes.

1444
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:44,400
Let's take a look. That's normal.
Pulse rate is slowing.

1445
01:58:44,490 --> 01:58:46,490
She is gonna struggle to breathe.

1446
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:48,820
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

1447
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:07,880
All right, he says, "I went back home."
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

1448
01:59:08,090 --> 01:59:11,850
"I listened to the sound of the house."
I read that already.

1449
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:13,850
He...

1450
01:59:14,770 --> 01:59:18,060
He spilt something on it,
so it's hard to read, Mom.

1451
01:59:19,190 --> 01:59:21,980
Something about sailing,
does that make sense?

1452
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:26,070
I learned to sail an old boat
of my father's from the lake house.

1453
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:37,250
I can't lie.

1454
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:40,170
I did enjoy the company
of a woman or two.

1455
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:50,050
Or maybe three.

1456
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:30,800
Don't know why you bother, Sam,
just gonna be there again tomorrow.

1457
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:36,310
Mama.

1458
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:43,650
And in the spring of 1962,

1459
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:49,030
she came back.

1460
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:12,050
- You want to know where I've been?
- No.

1461
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:18,930
How come you didn't write or nothing?
Just disappearing like that.

1462
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:21,600
It was something I needed to do
for myself.

1463
02:01:21,690 --> 02:01:25,440
Yeah, well, I never took you
to be the selfish type.

1464
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:28,020
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1465
02:01:29,150 --> 02:01:31,240
I'm usually not wrong about people.

1466
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:33,860
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

1467
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:36,490
Y'all have fun.

1468
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:43,580
- You haven't said two words.
- I don't want to ruin it.

1469
02:02:13,740 --> 02:02:16,070
- Sleep with me?
- Absolutely.

1470
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:56,280
I asked her to come away with me.

1471
02:02:58,490 --> 02:03:01,620
We sailed into the Gulf
along the Florida Keys.

1472
02:03:42,950 --> 02:03:47,330
I am so glad we didn't find one another
when I was 26.

1473
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:51,750
- Why do you say that?
- I was so young.

1474
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,630
And you were so old.

1475
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:57,220
It happened
when it was supposed to happen.

1476
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:00,470
I will enjoy each and every moment
I have with you.

1477
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:08,100
I bet I can stay out here longer than you.

1478
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:09,810
I bet you can't.

1479
02:04:12,650 --> 02:04:15,190
Barely a line or a crease.

1480
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:18,740
Every day I have more wrinkles.
It's not fair.

1481
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:24,160
I love your wrinkles. Both of them.

1482
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:32,170
What's it like growing younger?

1483
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:39,220
I can't really say.
I'm always looking out my own eyes.

1484
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:48,020
Will you still love me
when my skin grows old and saggy?

1485
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:52,600
Will you still love me when I have acne?
When I wet the bed?

1486
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:56,770
When I'm afraid
of what's under the stairs?

1487
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:05,330
What?

1488
02:05:11,330 --> 02:05:15,340
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1489
02:05:17,710 --> 02:05:19,760
And what a shame that is.

1490
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,390
Some things last.

1491
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:30,890
- Good night, Daisy.
- Good night, Benjamin.

1492
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,370
Mom?

1493
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:54,670
- When did you meet Dad?
- Some time after that.

1494
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:02,550
- Did you tell him about this Benjamin?
- He knew enough, darling.

1495
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:23,650
Mama?

1496
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:32,120
Queenie?

1497
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:36,580
Hello?

1498
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,630
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1499
02:06:40,710 --> 02:06:45,930
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.
I'm so sorry.

1500
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:18,000
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1501
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:19,920
Our deepest condolences.

1502
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:28,090
We buried her
beside her beloved Mr. Weathers.

1503
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:38,560
And so we might have memories
of our own,

1504
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:40,610
we sold my father's house
on Esplanade.

1505
02:07:40,690 --> 02:07:43,320
It is a wonderful old place, darling.

1506
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:46,820
I think we are going to be
so happy here.

1507
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:49,820
Oh, what a long family history you have.

1508
02:07:49,910 --> 02:07:51,910
They come with the house.

1509
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:57,410
- Come on.
- You have to see the master suite.

1510
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:01,170
We bought ourselves a duplex.

1511
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:05,250
I loved that house.

1512
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,680
It smelled like firewood.

1513
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:14,010
Don't... Don't stop, darling.

1514
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:17,480
"It was one of the happiest times
of my life."

1515
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:20,100
We didn't have a stick of furniture.

1516
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:23,650
We would have picnics
in the living room.

1517
02:08:27,110 --> 02:08:31,110
We ate when we felt like it.
Stayed up all night when we wanted.

1518
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:34,530
We vowed never to fall into routine,

1519
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:37,500
to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.

1520
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:39,620
We lived on that mattress.

1521
02:09:15,330 --> 02:09:18,830
Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.

1522
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:23,170
We lived four blocks from a public pool.

1523
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:04,330
You know, you might've got
a few more years out of it,

1524
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:08,540
but you chose to do
something so special and unique

1525
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:13,720
that there was only
a short window of time you could do it.

1526
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:18,010
So, even if nothing ever happened,

1527
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:21,220
you'd still be right here
where you are now.

1528
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:23,560
I just don't like getting old.

1529
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:27,650
They put too much chlorine in here.

1530
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:12,780
I promise you I'll never lose myself
to self-pity again.

1531
02:11:17,110 --> 02:11:20,200
And I think right there and then

1532
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:24,290
she realized
none of us is perfect forever.

1533
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:29,880
She found peace.

1534
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:34,670
She opened a studio
and taught young girls how to dance.

1535
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:37,880
And tendu.

1536
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:43,060
Come back the other way.
And spot, spot, spot. Excellent.

1537
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:47,180
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Good night.

1538
02:12:12,670 --> 02:12:15,300
You certainly are beautiful to watch.

1539
02:12:17,090 --> 02:12:19,510
Dancing's all about the line.

1540
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:23,680
The line of your body.

1541
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:29,350
Sooner or later, you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1542
02:12:35,230 --> 02:12:41,200
I figure, you were born in 1918,
49 years ago.

1543
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:42,820
I'm 43.

1544
02:12:44,990 --> 02:12:47,540
We are almost the same age.

1545
02:12:50,830 --> 02:12:55,040
- We're meeting in the middle.
- We finally caught up with each other.

1546
02:12:56,210 --> 02:12:57,340
Wait.

1547
02:12:58,670 --> 02:13:01,340
I want to remember us
just as we are now.

1548
02:13:12,190 --> 02:13:13,690
I'm pregnant.

1549
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:35,040
You know, I swear the nurse slipped
and said it was a boy.

1550
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:52,020
But I think it's a girl.

1551
02:13:57,320 --> 02:14:00,900
- I know you're afraid.
- I'm not hiding it.

1552
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:02,110
Okay.

1553
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:12,040
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1554
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:14,580
Then I will love it all the more.

1555
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:21,550
Okay. How can I be a father
when I'm heading in the other direction?

1556
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:25,510
It's not fair to a child.
I don't want to be anybody's burden.

1557
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:28,470
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1558
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:31,970
I am gonna make this work.

1559
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:37,560
I want this, and I want it with you.

1560
02:14:37,650 --> 02:14:41,070
I want you to have everything you want,
all of it.

1561
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:44,360
I'm just not sure how to reconcile this.

1562
02:14:44,450 --> 02:14:46,530
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1563
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:48,200
Here you go.

1564
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:51,740
You'll be a father for as long as you can.

1565
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:54,620
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1566
02:14:54,710 --> 02:14:57,330
Loving you is worth everything to me.

1567
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:03,510
I have to go pee.

1568
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:19,810
The oldest woman
to ever swim the English Channel

1569
02:15:19,900 --> 02:15:21,650
arrived here today in Calais...

1570
02:15:21,730 --> 02:15:24,240
- Keep it.
...having made the swim in 34 hours,

1571
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:26,530
22 minutes and 14 seconds.

1572
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:31,450
The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,

1573
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:33,330
exhausted but happy.

1574
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:36,960
Miss Abbott, how would you sum up,
in words, this achievement?

1575
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:38,670
I suppose...

1576
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:41,790
Anything's possible.

1577
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:46,970
- All right?
- Yes. Thank you.

1578
02:15:47,050 --> 02:15:48,050
- You ready?
- Thank you very much.

1579
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:50,090
Thank you. Thank you all.

1580
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:52,180
- Yeah.
- You're very kind.

1581
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:03,270
In the spring, on a day like any other...

1582
02:16:04,030 --> 02:16:06,030
I'll be back in an hour!

1583
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:12,240
Honey?

1584
02:16:14,290 --> 02:16:16,330
Go and call an ambulance!

1585
02:16:19,250 --> 02:16:20,920
The baby's coming.

1586
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:22,790
Operator, I need an ambulance.

1587
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:25,340
- The baby's coming!
- 2714 Napoleon.

1588
02:16:32,550 --> 02:16:35,260
There you go. Keep breathing.

1589
02:16:36,140 --> 02:16:38,560
Deep breaths. Push.

1590
02:16:48,450 --> 02:16:49,860
There we go.

1591
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:09,630
Everyone's fine.
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

1592
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:17,720
Honey?

1593
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:23,310
She gave birth to a five pound,
four ounce baby girl.

1594
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:41,410
Did you count the toes?

1595
02:17:45,710 --> 02:17:47,250
She's perfect.

1596
02:17:47,670 --> 02:17:50,970
"And we named her
for my mother, Caroline."

1597
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:56,850
This Benjamin was my father?

1598
02:17:58,350 --> 02:18:00,520
And this is how you tell me?

1599
02:18:06,060 --> 02:18:07,440
Excuse me.

1600
02:18:17,910 --> 02:18:20,660
...because all the ingredients are there
for a major storm,

1601
02:18:20,750 --> 02:18:23,330
possibly even up to a Category 5.

1602
02:18:30,050 --> 02:18:33,760
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1603
02:18:37,010 --> 02:18:39,010
Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit,

1604
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:41,220
but we have to go with the guidance
that we have,

1605
02:18:41,310 --> 02:18:45,060
incorporate that information
and then pass it along to you.

1606
02:18:51,900 --> 02:18:56,740
"You grew as the doctor had promised,
normal and healthy."

1607
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:08,540
You're gonna have to find a real father
for her.

1608
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:13,460
What are you talking about?

1609
02:19:13,550 --> 02:19:16,840
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1610
02:19:16,930 --> 02:19:19,760
She'll learn to accept
whatever happens. She loves you.

1611
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:22,600
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1612
02:19:26,730 --> 02:19:28,020
- Is it me?
- Of course not.

1613
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,110
- Is my age beginning to bother you?
- Of course not.

1614
02:19:30,190 --> 02:19:34,230
- Is that what you're telling me?
- You can't raise the both of us.

1615
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:47,790
It was your first birthday.
We had a party for you.

1616
02:19:48,540 --> 02:19:50,380
The house was filled with children.

1617
02:19:50,460 --> 02:19:52,420
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

1618
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:56,170
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

1619
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:32,580
I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain,

1620
02:20:32,670 --> 02:20:35,420
I sold Button's Buttons,

1621
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:40,050
I sold my father's sailboat,
put it all into a savings account.

1622
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:45,510
And so that you
and your mother might have a life,

1623
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:50,690
I left,
before you could ever remember me.

1624
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:42,570
"I left with just the clothes on my back."

1625
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:48,580
I don't want to read this now.
Can you just tell me where he went?

1626
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:52,290
I don't really know.

1627
02:22:03,550 --> 02:22:08,510
It's for me. 1970. I was two.
"Happy Birthday.

1628
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:14,140
"I wish
I could have kissed you good night."

1629
02:22:19,230 --> 02:22:20,980
They're all for me.

1630
02:22:21,990 --> 02:22:26,990
Five. "I wish I could have taken you
to your first day of school."

1631
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:37,380
Six. "I wish I could have been there
to teach you to play piano."

1632
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,760
1981, 13.

1633
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:47,180
"I wish I could have told you
not to chase some boy.

1634
02:22:48,470 --> 02:22:52,140
"I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart.

1635
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:59,440
"I wish I could have been your father.
Nothing I ever did will replace that."

1636
02:23:06,910 --> 02:23:09,450
I guess he went to India.

1637
02:23:09,530 --> 02:23:11,990
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,

1638
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:13,910
- "or, in my case, too early..."
...or, in my case, too early,

1639
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:17,170
to be whoever you want to be.

1640
02:23:21,170 --> 02:23:23,880
There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.

1641
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:31,260
You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.

1642
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:37,310
We can make the best or the worst of it.

1643
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:39,730
And I hope you make the best of it.

1644
02:23:42,820 --> 02:23:45,530
I hope you see things that startle you.

1645
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:51,200
I hope you feel things
you never felt before.

1646
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:57,210
I hope you meet people
with a different point of view.

1647
02:23:58,330 --> 02:24:01,040
I hope you live a life you're proud of.

1648
02:24:04,050 --> 02:24:09,090
And if you find that you're not,
I hope you have the strength

1649
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:12,390
- to start all over again.
- "...start all over again."

1650
02:24:13,930 --> 02:24:17,680
He had been gone a long time.

1651
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:21,560
I'll see you next Thursday.

1652
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:27,900
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Oh, good night, sweetheart.

1653
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:47,760
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1654
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:52,260
Can I help you?

1655
02:24:53,810 --> 02:24:56,260
Are you here to pick somebody up?

1656
02:25:06,610 --> 02:25:08,490
Why did you come back?

1657
02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:13,490
Mom?

1658
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:16,240
You ready yet?

1659
02:25:19,210 --> 02:25:20,330
Mom, what's wrong?

1660
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:24,000
I was just hearing a very sad story
about a mutual friend

1661
02:25:24,090 --> 02:25:26,800
who I hadn't seen for a very long time.

1662
02:25:28,050 --> 02:25:30,800
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1663
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:33,640
You knew him
when you were just a baby.

1664
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:37,310
- Hi.
- Hi.

1665
02:25:39,230 --> 02:25:41,140
Hey.

1666
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:47,940
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done.
- Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

1667
02:25:48,030 --> 02:25:52,990
Benjamin Button,
this is my husband, Robert.

1668
02:25:53,070 --> 02:25:55,490
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.

1669
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:06,630
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

1670
02:26:06,710 --> 02:26:08,550
- We'll be in the car, darling.
- All right.

1671
02:26:08,630 --> 02:26:09,800
Bye.

1672
02:26:10,510 --> 02:26:12,300
I'm just locking up.

1673
02:26:17,010 --> 02:26:18,140
Wow.

1674
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:23,520
She's beautiful. Like her mother.

1675
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:27,610
- Does she dance?
- Not very well.

1676
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:29,610
I guess that'd be
from my side of things.

1677
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:31,690
She's a dear, sweet girl.

1678
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:37,240
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at 12?

1679
02:26:37,410 --> 02:26:41,700
A lot of her reminds me of you.

1680
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:46,540
My husband, he's a widower, or was...
Was a widower.

1681
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:50,840
He's an incredibly kind, just bright,
adventurous man.

1682
02:26:53,970 --> 02:26:56,720
- He's been a terrific father.
- Good.

1683
02:27:01,390 --> 02:27:05,310
- You are so much younger.
- Only on the outside.

1684
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:08,940
You were right.

1685
02:27:10,690 --> 02:27:14,070
I couldn't have been raising both of you.

1686
02:27:14,150 --> 02:27:15,950
I'm not that strong.

1687
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:22,200
So, where are you staying?

1688
02:27:24,830 --> 02:27:25,830
What are you gonna do?

1689
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:29,750
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel
on the Avenue.

1690
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:33,380
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1691
02:27:33,460 --> 02:27:34,670
But...

1692
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:42,810
They're waiting.

1693
02:28:24,930 --> 02:28:28,230
I remember that. That was him?

1694
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:32,060
The hurricane has changed directions.

1695
02:28:32,150 --> 02:28:33,980
It's going to make landfall
sometime soon.

1696
02:28:34,070 --> 02:28:35,820
- Am I supposed to do something?
- Arrangements are being made

1697
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:37,150
to move people, but it's up to you.

1698
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:39,110
No. No, we're... We're staying.

1699
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:41,870
I'll let you know if anything changes.

1700
02:28:43,870 --> 02:28:48,250
"That night, while I was sitting
and wondering why I came back at all,

1701
02:28:48,330 --> 02:28:50,670
"there was a knock at the door."

1702
02:28:54,300 --> 02:28:55,550
Come in.

1703
02:29:09,850 --> 02:29:11,520
Are you all right?

1704
02:29:14,610 --> 02:29:18,740
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1705
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:29,290
Nothing lasts.

1706
02:29:32,710 --> 02:29:35,090
I have never stopped loving you.

1707
02:29:41,050 --> 02:29:43,800
Oh, but, Benjamin,
I'm an old woman now.

1708
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:56,650
Some things you never forget.

1709
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:18,000
...so few people even know

1710
02:30:18,090 --> 02:30:19,800
that you were ever in jail
in the first place.

1711
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:22,090
I'll tell you, I am sick about it, too,

1712
02:30:22,170 --> 02:30:24,760
because, please,
if they're not gonna give you an award

1713
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:26,930
like "Man of the Year,"
at least what they could do

1714
02:30:27,010 --> 02:30:29,680
is stop having you listed
as an ex-convict

1715
02:30:29,770 --> 02:30:32,310
which I think is, again, so unfair.

1716
02:30:45,070 --> 02:30:46,910
Good night, Benjamin.

1717
02:30:48,410 --> 02:30:50,120
Good night, Daisy.

1718
02:30:53,290 --> 02:30:57,540
And as I knew I would,
I watched her go.

1719
02:31:00,250 --> 02:31:02,590
That's the last thing he wrote.

1720
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:08,300
Sometime after your father passed,

1721
02:31:08,390 --> 02:31:11,260
there was a call.

1722
02:31:14,310 --> 02:31:15,480
Hello.

1723
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:18,100
Yes, speaking.

1724
02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:23,900
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1725
02:31:33,700 --> 02:31:35,620
It's the corner house.

1726
02:31:57,770 --> 02:31:59,190
Come on in.

1727
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:06,780
- I'm Daisy Fuller.
- I'm David Hernandez,

1728
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:10,620
with the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

1729
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:13,370
He was living in a condemned building.

1730
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:17,460
The police found this with him.

1731
02:32:17,540 --> 02:32:20,500
This address.
It's got your name in it a lot.

1732
02:32:21,670 --> 02:32:24,300
He's in very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1733
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:28,470
He doesn't seem to know who
or where he is. He's very confused.

1734
02:32:28,550 --> 02:32:32,140
I was telling Mr. Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1735
02:32:32,220 --> 02:32:36,060
If he needs a place to stay,
it's all right, he can stay here.

1736
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:06,800
Benjamin?

1737
02:33:10,630 --> 02:33:12,470
You play beautifully.

1738
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:17,810
He doesn't seem to like to be touched.

1739
02:33:17,890 --> 02:33:19,560
He goes in and out
of states of recognition.

1740
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:21,310
The doctors say,
if they didn't know any better,

1741
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:23,860
he has the beginnings of dementia.

1742
02:33:25,610 --> 02:33:27,400
Do you remember me?

1743
02:33:30,530 --> 02:33:31,910
I'm Daisy.

1744
02:33:34,450 --> 02:33:35,950
I'm Benjamin.

1745
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:44,330
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1746
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:51,420
Would you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1747
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:56,800
Do I know you?

1748
02:34:01,730 --> 02:34:03,390
- I want some breakfast.
- And every day,

1749
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:07,440
I would stop by to make sure
that he was comfortable.

1750
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:10,190
- No, I didn't.
- You just finished eating.

1751
02:34:10,280 --> 02:34:12,610
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing!

1752
02:34:12,700 --> 02:34:15,450
You're all fucking liars!

1753
02:34:15,530 --> 02:34:18,490
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1754
02:34:19,790 --> 02:34:23,410
Now, why don't we see

1755
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:26,920
if we can't find something else
for you to do?

1756
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:30,260
I have a feeling
there's a lot of things I can't remember.

1757
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:32,260
Well, like what, sugar?

1758
02:34:33,510 --> 02:34:37,510
It's like there's this whole life I had,

1759
02:34:38,970 --> 02:34:41,390
and I can't remember what it was.

1760
02:34:44,190 --> 02:34:45,520
It's okay.

1761
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:49,110
It's okay to forget things.

1762
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:54,900
Many times, he would simply forget
who or where he was.

1763
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:56,910
There he is, he's up there on the roof.

1764
02:34:56,990 --> 02:34:58,700
It wasn't easy.

1765
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:01,040
- Benjamin!
- I can see everything!

1766
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:02,910
- I can see the big river!
- That's right,

1767
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,750
you can see everything, sweetheart.

1768
02:35:04,830 --> 02:35:06,830
I can see the graveyard
where Mama's buried,

1769
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:10,300
- and all those other people.
- I want you to come down!

1770
02:35:10,380 --> 02:35:14,170
- What if I could fly?
- I knew a man who could fly.

1771
02:35:15,130 --> 02:35:18,140
You come down
and I'll tell you all about him.

1772
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:23,310
Somebody go up there.

1773
02:35:29,900 --> 02:35:32,860
He was five when I moved in.

1774
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:37,450
Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.

1775
02:35:43,410 --> 02:35:47,370
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1776
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:49,920
"at 5:00 in the afternoon

1777
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,500
"when he had got
his beautiful hind legs."

1778
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:56,010
The days passed.

1779
02:35:56,090 --> 02:36:00,390
And I watched as he forgot how to walk

1780
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:08,060
- and how to talk.
- What's my name?

1781
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:09,850
I'm Daisy.

1782
02:36:10,980 --> 02:36:12,770
Can you say "Daisy"?

1783
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:19,610
In 2002, they put up a new clock
in that train station.

1784
02:36:26,460 --> 02:36:30,250
And in the spring of 2003,

1785
02:36:34,590 --> 02:36:36,300
he looked at me

1786
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:43,850
and I knew that he knew who I was.

1787
02:36:47,350 --> 02:36:53,190
And then he closed his eyes
as if to go to sleep.

1788
02:37:25,720 --> 02:37:29,930
- I wish I'd known him.
- Now you do.

1789
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:38,190
Mom, I think I should go see
what's going on.

1790
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:47,290
Good night, Benjamin.

1791
02:38:09,640 --> 02:38:12,020
We're expecting flash flooding
after the levee break.

1792
02:38:12,100 --> 02:38:14,400
It occurred in the Ninth Ward.

1793
02:38:17,400 --> 02:38:20,230
Some people are born to sit by a river.

1794
02:38:21,740 --> 02:38:23,740
Some get struck by lightning.

1795
02:38:25,570 --> 02:38:27,740
Some have an ear for music.

1796
02:38:29,290 --> 02:38:30,950
Some are artists.

1797
02:38:32,250 --> 02:38:33,620
Some swim.

1798
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:36,710
Some know buttons.

1799
02:38:38,460 --> 02:38:39,880
Some know Shakespeare.

1800
02:38:41,010 --> 02:38:42,800
Some are mothers.

1801
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:47,000
And some people dance.
