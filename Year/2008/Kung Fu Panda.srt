1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,138
Legend tells of a legendary warrior...

2
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,368
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,072
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

4
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:03,624
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

5
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,223
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

6
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,463
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

7
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,835
Enough talk. Let's fight!

8
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,339
Shashabooey!

9
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,141
He was so deadly in fact,

10
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,909
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

11
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,177
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

12
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,015
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

13
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,255
There is no charge for awesomeness.

14
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,952
Or attractiveness.

15
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,289
Kablooey!

16
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,091
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

17
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,031
They were no match for his bodacity!

18
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:58,210
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

19
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,781
Even the most heroic heroes in China,

20
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,085
the Furious Five,

21
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,092
bowed in respect
to this great master.

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,991
We should hang out.

23
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,188
Agreed.

24
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,193
But hanging out would have to wait.

25
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:19,705
Because when you're facing
the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain,

26
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,570
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

27
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,401
Po! Get up!

28
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,240
You'll be later for work!

29
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,574
What?

30
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,351
Po! Get up!

31
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:55,162
Po. What are you doing up there?

32
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,503
Nothing.

33
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,777
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

34
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,521
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

35
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,958
Coming!

36
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,497
Sorry, Dad.

37
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,406
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

38
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,841
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

39
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,402
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

40
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,708
About what?

41
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,374
What were you dreaming about?

42
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,974
What was I?

43
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,810
I was dreaming about...

44
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:44,845
...noodles.

45
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,988
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

46
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,622
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

47
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,166
Careful! That soup is sharp.

48
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,701
Oh, happy day!

49
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,670
My son, finally having the noodle dream!

50
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,067
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

51
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,009
This is a sign, Po.

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,877
A sign of what?

53
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:13,578
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

54
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,917
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

55
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,120
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

56
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,686
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father...

57
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,426
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.

58
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,196
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,568
No, it was the dream.

60
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,200
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

61
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,178
But, Dad, didn't you ever want
to do something else?

62
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,111
Something besides noodles?

63
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,116
Actually, when I was young and crazy,

64
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:49,245
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

65
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,448
Why didn't you?

66
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,286
Because it was a stupid dream.

67
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,495
Can you imagine me making tofu?

68
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,992
Tofu.

69
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,466
No! We all have our place in this world.

70
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,095
Mine is here, and yours is...

71
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,399
I know, is here.

72
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,600
No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12

73
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,735
Service with a smile.

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,340
Well done, students...
if you were trying to disappoint me.

75
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,574
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

76
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,549
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis...

77
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,448
- Master Shifu.
- What?!

78
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,953
It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.

79
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,302
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

80
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:21,079
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

81
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,274
So, nothing's wrong?

82
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,977
Well, I didn't say that.

83
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,699
You were saying?

84
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,865
I have had a vision.

85
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,671
Tai Lung will return.

86
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,176
That is impossible! He is in prison.

87
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,016
Nothing is impossible.

88
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:03,878
Zeng!

89
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,288
Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them

90
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,692
to double the guards, double
their weapons, double everything!

91
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,662
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

92
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,198
Yes, Master Shifu!

93
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:20,199
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

94
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,266
We must do something! We can't let him
march on the valley, take his revenge!

95
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,332
He'll...

96
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,709
Your mind is like this water,
my friend.

97
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,216
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

98
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,382
But if you allow it to settle...

99
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,449
...the answer becomes clear.

100
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,556
The Dragon Scroll.

101
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,987
It is time.

102
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:49,797
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

103
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:54,602
To become the Dragon Warrior?

104
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,141
I don't know.

105
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,903
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

106
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,837
Watch it!

107
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,404
Sorry. Suck it up!

108
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,581
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

109
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,642
What?

110
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,021
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

111
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:18,689
Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of
the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

112
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,824
We've waited 1,000 years for this!
Take the bowl!

113
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:26,031
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history! Just go!

114
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,096
Po! Where are you going?

115
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,340
To the Jade Palace.

116
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,708
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

117
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,341
The whole valley will be there,
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

118
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,816
Selling noodles?

119
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,922
But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...

120
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,118
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

121
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:55,525
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

122
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,296
That's my boy!

123
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,633
I told you that dream was a sign.

124
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,641
Yeah. Glad I had it.

125
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,246
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

126
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,840
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

127
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,116
Come on. Come on!

128
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,053
Almost there.

129
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,283
What?

130
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,020
No! Oh, no!

131
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,924
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

132
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,863
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

133
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,479
It is an historic day.

134
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,311
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

135
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:22,252
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

136
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,312
Are your students ready?

137
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,153
Yes, Master Oogway.

138
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,055
Know this, old friend.

139
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,462
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley...

140
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,160
...but also to you.

141
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:39,972
Let the tournament begin!

142
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,635
Let the tournament begin!

143
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,452
Yeah.

144
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,186
No, no, wait!

145
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,591
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

146
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,890
Yes!

147
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,265
Hey! Open the door!

148
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,264
Let me in!

149
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,900
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

150
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,673
it is my great honor
to present to you... Tigress!

151
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,910
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

152
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,315
The Furious Five!

153
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,565
Yeah, the Furious Five!

154
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,199
Warriors, prepare!

155
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,830
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

156
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,237
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

157
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,300
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

158
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,739
Look at that.

159
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,806
Hey! Get out of the way!

160
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,351
And finally Master Tigress!

161
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:40,191
And believe me, citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

162
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,521
I know!

163
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:46,691
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

164
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,548
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.

165
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,713
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

166
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,319
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

167
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,457
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

168
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,223
Yeah.

169
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,775
Po!

170
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,786
What are you doing?!

171
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,414
What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!

172
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,424
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

173
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,858
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

174
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,759
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, Dad.

175
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,100
I love kung fu!

176
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:21,124
Come on, son. Let's get back to work.

177
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,128
OK.

178
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,966
Come back!

179
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,993
What's going on?

180
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,426
Where?

181
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,494
What are you pointing?

182
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,231
OK. Sorry.

183
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,777
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

184
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,779
How interesting.

185
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,146
Master, are you pointing at me?

186
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,242
- Him.
- Who?

187
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,449
- You.
- Me?

188
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:30,018
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

189
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,695
- What?
- What?!

190
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,459
- What?!
- What?!

191
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,936
Stop, wait! Who told you to?

192
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,950
Master Oogway, wait.

193
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:01,288
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

194
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:05,058
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

195
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,563
That was just an accident!

196
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,396
There are no accidents.

197
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,280
Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

198
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,686
No. If the panda
has not quit by morning

199
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,088
then I will have failed you.

200
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,107
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message...

201
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,443
...from Master Shifu.

202
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,278
What?!

203
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,685
"Double the guard?!"

204
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,553
"Extra precautions?!"

205
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,956
"Your prison may not be adequate?!"

206
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,521
You doubt my prison security?!

207
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,465
Absolutely not.

208
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,663
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

209
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:23,367
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

210
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,137
Escape from Chorh-Gom prison
is impossible!

211
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,318
Impressive, isn't it?

212
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,084
It's very impressive.

213
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,646
It's very impressive.

214
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,386
One way in, one way out.

215
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,556
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

216
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,156
Yes, except that prisoner...

217
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,928
...is Tai Lung.

218
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,735
Take us down.

219
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,611
What are you doing?

220
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,426
Oh, my.

221
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,758
Behold Tai Lung.

222
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,496
I'm just gonna wait right here.

223
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:31,873
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

224
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,208
Crossbows! At the ready!

225
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,076
Crossbows?

226
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,708
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

227
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:43,278
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.

228
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,016
Don't get him mad.

229
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,891
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

230
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,092
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

231
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm good. I've seen enough.

232
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,472
I'll tell Shifu he
has nothing to worry about.

233
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,769
No, he doesn't.

234
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,072
I'll tell him that.

235
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,010
Can we please go now?

236
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,498
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

237
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,021
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

238
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,171
Wait a second!

239
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,842
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

240
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,118
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

241
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,522
Look at this place.

242
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,130
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage!

243
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,061
The Sword of Heroes!

244
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,400
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking.

245
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,136
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

246
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,975
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

247
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,812
No!

248
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,921
The legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

249
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,156
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

250
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,659
Hello.

251
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,066
Have you finished sight-seeing?

252
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,229
Sorry, I should have come to you first.

253
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,273
My patience is wearing thin.

254
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,174
Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

255
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,610
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

256
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,703
How's it going?

257
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,214
How do you get 5,000...
Master Shifu!

258
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,582
Someone... broke that.

259
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,020
But I'll fix it. Do you have some...

260
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,185
...glue?

261
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,184
A splinter.

262
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,255
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

263
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,460
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

264
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:14,266
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will
never be the Dragon Warrior until...

265
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,274
...you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

266
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,912
So, how does this work?

267
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,881
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or?

268
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:30,245
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

269
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,222
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

270
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,317
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

271
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,455
And that is impossible
if that one is someone like you.

272
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,555
Someone like me?

273
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:45,296
Yes, look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

274
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,838
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

275
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,739
And this ridiculous belly.

276
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,074
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

277
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,307
Now, wait a minute.
That's uncalled for.

278
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,906
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

279
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,882
Listen, Oogway said I was...

280
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,615
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

281
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,419
Oh, you know this hold?

282
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,153
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

283
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,991
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

284
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,526
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

285
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,468
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

286
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,665
OK, OK, take it easy.

287
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,174
Now listen closely, panda.

288
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,370
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

289
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:32,349
I promise you, you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

290
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,645
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

291
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,450
Good.

292
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,456
I can't wait to get started.

293
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,328
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

294
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,930
What?

295
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,971
- Now?
- Yes, now.

296
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,338
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

297
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,968
Oh, OK, well...

298
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:37,037
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

299
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,879
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

300
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,785
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

301
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:44,913
What level is that?

302
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,448
Well, I'm not a master, but...

303
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,291
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.

304
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:55,459
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

305
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,298
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

306
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:03,466
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

307
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,873
But if you insist...

308
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,707
The Furious Five!

309
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,045
You're bigger than your action figures.
Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.

310
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,880
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

311
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,125
Are they gonna watch, or should I wait
till they get back to work?

312
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,184
Hit it.

313
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,926
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

314
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,766
So my kung fu might not be
as good as... later on.

315
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:33,964
Just hit it.

316
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,932
All right.

317
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:40,309
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

318
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,404
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

319
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,677
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

320
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,742
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

321
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,617
You've only seen praying mantis.

322
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,623
Or monkey style.

323
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,623
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

324
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,060
Would you hit it!

325
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,290
All right. All right.

326
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,098
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

327
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,104
How's that?

328
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,378
That hurts.

329
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,557
This will be easier than I thought.

330
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,123
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

331
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,265
Those are hard!

332
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,074
My tenders.

333
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,865
How did I do?

334
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,739
There is now a level zero.

335
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:17,909
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

336
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,207
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

337
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,610
What was Master Oogway thinking?

338
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,979
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

339
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,541
He is so mighty!

340
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:32,454
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

341
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,357
When he walks, the very ground shakes!

342
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,627
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

343
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,724
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

344
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,201
Or even see his toes.

345
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,721
OK.

346
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,164
Great.

347
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,613
Hi. You're up.

348
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,088
I am now.

349
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,656
I was just...

350
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,625
Some day, huh?

351
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:47,097
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

352
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,934
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day, so...

353
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,005
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

354
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,542
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

355
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:02,444
It's just...
Man, I'm such a big fan!

356
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,210
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

357
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,775
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

358
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,888
Sorry about that.

359
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,449
Look, you don't belong here.

360
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,064
I know. I know. You're right.

361
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,623
I don't have... I just...

362
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,226
My whole life I dreamed of...

363
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:30,172
No, I meant you don't belong here.
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

364
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,602
Property of Crane.

365
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,543
OK. Right, right.

366
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,138
So, you want to get to sleep.

367
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,013
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

368
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,212
We got big things tomorrow.

369
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:46,485
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

370
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,488
What was that?

371
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,996
I didn't say anything.

372
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,225
OK. All right. Good night.

373
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,494
Sleep well.

374
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,169
That seemed a little awkward.

375
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,632
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

376
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,406
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

377
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,777
This is your room.

378
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,147
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

379
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,584
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have

380
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:19,282
any respect for who we are
and what we do,

381
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,785
you will be gone by morning.

382
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,859
Big fan!

383
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,108
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

384
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:47,146
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

385
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:52,155
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

386
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:56,216
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

387
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,895
So why are you so upset?

388
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,563
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

389
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,269
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

390
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,435
Probably.

391
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,208
And the Five! Man, you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

392
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,271
Totally.

393
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,410
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

394
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,456
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

395
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:30,085
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

396
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,096
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

397
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:38,100
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

398
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,433
Quit, don't quit.

399
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,535
Noodles, don't noodles.

400
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:52,276
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

401
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,215
There's a saying:

402
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,719
Yesterday is history,

403
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,255
tomorrow is a mystery,

404
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,418
but today is a gift.

405
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:05,291
That is why it is called the present.

406
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,659
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?!

407
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,220
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

408
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,600
Fire crossbows!

409
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,006
Fire!

410
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,670
Fire!

411
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,017
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

412
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,923
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!

413
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,119
Bring it up!

414
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,354
Wait! Bring it back!

415
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:37,144
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

416
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,120
We're dead. So very, very dead.

417
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,885
Not yet we're not. Now!

418
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,272
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

419
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,532
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

420
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,636
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

421
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,731
Fly back there and tell them...

422
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:14,539
...the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

423
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,048
Good morning, Master!

424
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,154
Panda!

425
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,218
Panda!

426
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,791
Wake up!

427
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,563
He's quit.

428
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:45,634
What do we do now, with the panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

429
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,804
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

430
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,508
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

431
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,541
What are you doing here?!

432
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,477
Hi! Good morning, Master!

433
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,453
I thought I'd warm up a little.

434
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,581
You're stuck.

435
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,026
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

436
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,828
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

437
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,834
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

438
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,437
Maybe on three. One, two...

439
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,700
...three.

440
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,137
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

441
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,146
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

442
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:27,514
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

443
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,952
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility!

444
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,788
And years longer to apply it in combat!

445
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,726
Put that down!

446
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:50,297
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

447
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,309
Yeah! Excellent.

448
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,305
Let's get started.

449
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,480
- Are you ready?
- I was born re...

450
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,444
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

451
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,821
That was awesome! Let's go again!

452
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,120
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

453
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,520
Your next opponent will be me.

454
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,353
All right! Yeah, let's go!

455
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,920
Step forth.

456
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,455
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness...

457
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,398
...and make him suffer for it.

458
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,800
Oh, yeah!

459
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,237
To take his strength
and use it against him...

460
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,798
...until he finally falls...

461
00:37:58,909 --> 00:37:59,898
...or quits.

462
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,935
A real warrior never quits.

463
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:05,210
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

464
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,790
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

465
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,194
But he will.

466
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,562
He's not going to quit, is he?

467
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,397
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

468
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,341
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

469
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,442
Trust me, it will.

470
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,148
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

471
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,884
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

472
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:48,947
Sure you were.

473
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:53,087
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

474
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,254
I'm over here.

475
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,801
Maybe you should look at this again.

476
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,303
Oh, OK.

477
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,099
Stop it. Stop!

478
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,213
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

479
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:14,211
...but if I didn't know better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

480
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,556
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

481
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,161
...but he wasn't always like that.

482
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,559
According to legend,

483
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:30,157
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

484
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,168
- No!
- Yes.

485
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,498
But that was before.

486
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,562
Before what?

487
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,970
Before Tai Lung.

488
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,634
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

489
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,702
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

490
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,714
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

491
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:50,243
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

492
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:54,485
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

493
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,685
He wasn't just a student.

494
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,864
Shifu found him as a cub...

495
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,438
...and he raised him as his son.

496
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,868
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

497
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,243
...Shifu trained him.

498
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:21,444
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

499
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,883
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

500
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,217
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

501
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:33,593
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

502
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,628
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

503
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,129
He tried to take the scroll by force.

504
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:46,802
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

505
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,337
But how could he?

506
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:08,659
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

507
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,169
Or since.

508
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,517
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

509
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,817
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

510
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,915
And he's stuck with you.

511
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,860
A big fat panda
who treats it like a joke.

512
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:40,752
That is it!

513
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,959
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

514
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,871
And may have also stopped his heart.

515
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,101
Inner peace.

516
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,370
Inner peace.

517
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,046
Inner...

518
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,554
Inner peace.

519
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:13,054
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?!

520
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,562
Inner...

521
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,231
Oh, Zeng.

522
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,900
Excellent.

523
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,910
I could use some good news right now.

524
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,051
Master! Master!

525
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,987
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

526
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,425
Shifu.

527
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,896
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

528
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,628
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

529
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:55,103
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

530
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,304
That is bad news...

531
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:03,710
...if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

532
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:08,047
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

533
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:11,417
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

534
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,786
There are no accidents.

535
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:18,153
Yes, I know. You've said that already.

536
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:22,426
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

537
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:23,591
Thrice.

538
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,294
My old friend,

539
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,965
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

540
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,601
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

541
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,042
Illusion?

542
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,104
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

543
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,208
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

544
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,550
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

545
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,147
But there are things we can control.

546
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:51,319
I can control when the fruit will fall.

547
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,091
And I can control...

548
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,156
...where to plant the seed.

549
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,761
That is no illusion, Master.

550
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,396
Yes.

551
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,874
But no matter what you do

552
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,878
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

553
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:13,815
You may wish for an apple or an orange,
but you will get a peach.

554
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,513
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

555
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,250
Maybe it can.

556
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,122
If you are willing to guide it.

557
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,058
To nurture it.

558
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,528
To believe in it.

559
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,065
But how? How?

560
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,101
I need your help, Master.

561
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,865
No, you just need to believe.

562
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,870
Promise me, Shifu.

563
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:41,171
Promise me you will believe.

564
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:44,806
I will try.

565
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,139
Good.

566
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,378
My time has come.

567
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,959
You must continue
your journey without me.

568
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,757
What are you? Wait!

569
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,162
Master!

570
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,559
You can't leave me!

571
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,967
You must believe.

572
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,502
Master!

573
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,604
Yeah, so I'm like,
"Fine, you may be a wolf,

574
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,613
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

575
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,779
...but you're a lousy tipper."

576
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,785
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

577
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,951
I mean, I didn't actually say that...

578
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,756
...but I thought it...

579
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,587
...in my mind.

580
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:05,719
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

581
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,457
Order up! Hope you like it.

582
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,598
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

583
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,970
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

584
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,441
What do you mean? This is amazing!

585
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,446
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

586
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,414
Tigress, you've got to try this.

587
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:29,111
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months

588
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:33,987
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf
and the energy of the universe.

589
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,261
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

590
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:44,323
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

591
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,833
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

592
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:58,638
Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you
lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

593
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:03,319
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

594
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,220
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday...

595
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,190
...you will have ears like mine.

596
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,192
That's good.

597
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:15,196
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

598
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,658
It's Shifu!

599
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,566
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

600
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,963
Master Shifu!

601
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,704
You think this is funny?

602
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,747
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

603
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:33,112
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

604
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,549
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

605
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,851
And I was saying
you got no sense of humor.

606
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,223
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

607
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,127
What? You're serious? And I have to?

608
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,968
Master Oogway will stop him,
like he did before.

609
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,559
Oogway cannot!

610
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,470
Not anymore.

611
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,670
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

612
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,370
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

613
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:05,040
Master, let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

614
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:08,676
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

615
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,344
It is his!

616
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,546
Where'd he go?

617
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,195
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

618
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,824
Watch me.

619
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,528
Come on.

620
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:31,438
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

621
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,500
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

622
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,577
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

623
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,641
From the beginning,
you've tried to get rid of me.

624
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,050
Yes! I was.

625
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:49,252
But now I ask you to trust in your
master as I have come to trust in mine.

626
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:54,058
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

627
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:58,465
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew
I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.

628
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,593
Yeah, I stayed.

629
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:04,403
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

630
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:08,877
or said I smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

631
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,177
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

632
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,484
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me...

633
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,881
...could make me... not me...

634
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,323
...it was you.

635
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,528
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

636
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,187
But I can change you!

637
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,791
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

638
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:34,860
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

639
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:38,339
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here, how are you...

640
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:42,674
...gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

641
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:45,971
How?

642
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:48,606
How?

643
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,850
- How?!
- I don't know!

644
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,456
I don't know.

645
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,270
That's what I thought.

646
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:53,075
This is what you trained me for.

647
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,212
Tigress!

648
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,259
Don't try and stop me.

649
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,524
We're not trying to stop you.

650
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:12,590
What?

651
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,534
We're coming with you!

652
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,238
What? I eat when I'm upset, OK?

653
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,847
No need to explain.

654
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:38,081
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides
his almond cookies on the top shelf.

655
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,704
Don't tell Monkey.

656
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,940
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

657
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,006
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

658
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,847
I don't know. I guess that...

659
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,485
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

660
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,456
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

661
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,824
And you have done a perfect spilt.

662
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:20,863
No, this? This is just...

663
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:22,929
...an accident.

664
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,230
There are no accidents.

665
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,365
Come with me.

666
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,818
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

667
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,616
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

668
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,000
You dragged me...

669
00:53:58,101 --> 00:53:59,796
...all the way out here...

670
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,167
...for a bath?

671
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,139
Panda...

672
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:09,838
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

673
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,105
The Pool of...

674
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:14,776
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

675
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,046
...of harmony and focus.

676
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,645
This is the birthplace...

677
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:20,985
...of kung fu.

678
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,235
Do you want to learn kung fu?

679
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,296
Yeah!

680
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,640
Then I am your master!

681
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,474
OK!

682
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:45,906
Don't cry.

683
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,313
OK.

684
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,047
When you focus on kung fu,

685
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,252
when you concentrate...

686
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,827
...you stink.

687
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,762
Perhaps that is my fault.

688
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:04,288
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

689
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,461
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

690
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:08,834
...is with this.

691
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,669
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

692
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,633
Good.

693
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,406
When you have been trained, you may eat.

694
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,007
Let us begin.

695
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,811
After you, panda.

696
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,855
Just like that?

697
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:36,585
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

698
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:41,153
I vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

699
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,161
Enjoy.

700
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,172
Hey!

701
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,369
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

702
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,179
Hey!

703
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,421
You are free to eat.

704
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,388
- Am I?!
- Are you?!

705
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,300
I'm not hungry.

706
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,109
Master.

707
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,543
Cut it!

708
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,562
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

709
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:33,625
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

710
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,898
You think I'm a fool?

711
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:39,601
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

712
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,941
I heard how he fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

713
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:47,449
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

714
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:53,114
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

715
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:56,283
Finally, a worthy opponent.

716
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,850
Our battle will be legendary!

717
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,543
We've got this. Help her.

718
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,163
Monkey!

719
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,073
Go!

720
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,338
What was I thinking?!

721
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:00,780
Mantis!

722
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,462
Now!

723
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,674
Shifu taught you well.

724
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,582
But he didn't teach you everything.

725
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,177
You have done well, panda.

726
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,952
Done well? Done well?

727
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,323
I've done awesome!

728
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:16,226
The mark of a true hero is humility.

729
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,995
But, yes, you have done...

730
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:20,933
...awesome.

731
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:31,510
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

732
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:35,017
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
But their eyes are open.

733
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,075
We were no match for his nerve attach.

734
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,383
He's gotten stronger.

735
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,753
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

736
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:43,948
He's too fast!

737
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,584
Sorry, Po.

738
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,221
I thought we could stop him.

739
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,129
He could have killed you.

740
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,258
Why didn't he?

741
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:56,738
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

742
01:02:56,839 --> 01:03:01,139
It might. I mean, a little.

743
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,405
I'm pretty scared.

744
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,968
You can defeat him, panda!

745
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:06,981
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

746
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:10,041
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

747
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,486
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

748
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:21,319
You really believe I'm ready?

749
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,058
You are...

750
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,429
...Po.

751
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:16,943
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

752
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,953
It is yours.

753
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,956
Wait. What happens when I read it?

754
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:26,051
Legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

755
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,358
Really? That's cool.

756
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:31,264
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

757
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:34,235
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

758
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,337
Can I punch through walls?

759
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,771
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

760
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,035
- Will I?
- Focus.

761
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,842
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

762
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,812
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

763
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,076
Read it and become...

764
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:48,878
...the Dragon Warrior.

765
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,224
It's impossible to open.

766
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:01,425
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.

767
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,293
Thank you.

768
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,768
I probably loosened it up
for you though.

769
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,595
OK, here goes.

770
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:24,279
- It's blank.
- What?!

771
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,948
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

772
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:36,530
Blank. I don't...

773
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,793
I don't understand.

774
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,798
OK. So, like...

775
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:46,103
...Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

776
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,769
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

777
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:52,905
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

778
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:57,112
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

779
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,849
But who will stop Tai Lung?

780
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:02,413
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

781
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,152
No.

782
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,989
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

783
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,466
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

784
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,231
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

785
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,771
for everyone to escape.

786
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,273
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

787
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:22,175
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

788
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,238
Listen to me, all of you.

789
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,841
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

790
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,910
I am very proud
to have been your master.

791
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:55,074
We've got to get them out safely.

792
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,476
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

793
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,072
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

794
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,880
Crane, light the way.

795
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:24,963
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

796
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,081
Hey, Dad.

797
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,981
Po!

798
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,985
Good to have you back, son.

799
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:48,953
Good to be back.

800
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:50,658
Let's go, Po.

801
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:56,002
So for our next shop,
it's time to face it...

802
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,764
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

803
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,202
...no longer slices.

804
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:05,714
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

805
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:08,944
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

806
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,446
You like that?

807
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:22,189
Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

808
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,290
It just wasn't meant to be.

809
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,262
Po, forget everything else.

810
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,535
Your destiny still awaits.

811
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:38,376
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

812
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,745
I don't know, Dad.

813
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:44,809
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

814
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,282
Po...

815
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:53,795
...I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

816
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,922
...a long time ago.

817
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:57,727
OK.

818
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:03,231
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

819
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:10,605
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

820
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:11,668
...nothing.

821
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,583
You heard me. Nothing!

822
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,119
There is no secret ingredient!

823
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:21,247
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

824
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,190
You don't add some kind of special
sauce or something?

825
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:28,663
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just believe it's special.

826
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,832
There is no secret ingredient.

827
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,231
I have come home, Master.

828
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:10,568
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

829
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:14,575
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

830
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:17,737
So where is this Po?

831
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:20,409
Did I scare him off?

832
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,814
This battle is between you and me.

833
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,656
So, that is how it's going to be.

834
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,748
That is how it must be.

835
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:48,468
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

836
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,910
Obeying your master is not weakness!

837
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,778
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

838
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:56,010
You always knew.

839
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:01,022
But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?

840
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,682
What did you do?!

841
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:08,355
Nothing!

842
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,263
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

843
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,301
Not your fault?!

844
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:15,428
Who filled my head with dreams?!

845
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,734
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

846
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:20,536
Who denied me my destiny?!

847
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,379
It was never my decision to make!

848
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,157
It is now.

849
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,999
Give me the scroll!

850
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,298
I would rather die.

851
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,549
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

852
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:45,216
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

853
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,685
Tell me!

854
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:49,959
Tell me!

855
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:03,642
I have...
I have always been proud of you.

856
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:08,113
From the first moment, I've been...

857
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,481
...proud of you.

858
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,918
And it was my pride...

859
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:15,013
...that blinded me.

860
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:18,651
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming...

861
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,925
...what I...

862
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,988
...was turning you into.

863
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,768
I'm...

864
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:27,824
I'm sorry.

865
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:39,075
I don't want your apology.

866
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,672
I want my scroll!

867
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:45,117
What?!

868
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,415
Where is it?!

869
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:52,019
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

870
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:56,290
You will never see
that scroll, Tai Lung.

871
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:57,696
Never.

872
01:13:58,634 --> 01:13:59,623
Never.

873
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:07,872
Stairs.

874
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:12,109
Who are you?

875
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:17,209
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

876
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,553
You?

877
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,492
Him? He's a panda.

878
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,428
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

879
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,431
Don't tempt me.

880
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:34,526
No. I'm gonna use this.

881
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,230
You want it? Come and get it.

882
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,270
Finally!

883
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,701
That scroll is mine!

884
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:01,479
Lightning!

885
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:38,683
The scroll has given him power!

886
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,886
No!

887
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:21,302
Finally! Oh, yes.

888
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:26,239
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

889
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,570
It's nothing!

890
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:37,143
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

891
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,943
What?

892
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,985
There is no secret ingredient.

893
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:46,755
It's just you.

894
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:57,596
Stop it!

895
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,436
I'm gonna pee.

896
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,636
Don't.

897
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,372
Don't! Don't!

898
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:13,443
You...

899
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,745
...can't defeat me.

900
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:21,416
You...

901
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,555
...you're just a big...

902
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:26,218
...fat...

903
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,283
...panda!

904
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:31,391
I'm not a big fat panda.

905
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,764
I'm the big fat panda.

906
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,470
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

907
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:38,972
Oh, you know this hold?

908
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,999
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

909
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,773
Nope.

910
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:47,041
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

911
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:08,797
Look!

912
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:11,931
The Dragon Warrior.

913
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:44,270
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

914
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,433
Yes!

915
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,268
Thanks, Dad.

916
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:00,953
Hey, guys.

917
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,025
Master.

918
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:08,528
Master.

919
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,196
Master?

920
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,735
Master Shifu!

921
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,147
Master!

922
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,310
Shifu, are you OK?!

923
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:35,087
Po.

924
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:37,090
You're alive.

925
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:38,386
Or we're both dead.

926
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,396
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

927
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:43,590
You did?

928
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:53,603
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

929
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:57,167
You are the Dragon Warrior.

930
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,381
You have brought peace...

931
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:03,212
...to this valley...

932
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,480
...and...

933
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,180
...and to me.

934
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,517
Thank you.

935
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:13,589
Thank you, Po.

936
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:16,256
Thank you. Thank you.

937
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:26,764
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

938
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:29,571
I'm not dying, you idiot!

939
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:31,612
Dragon Warrior...

940
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:37,716
...I am simply at peace. Finally.

941
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,390
So, I should stop talking?

942
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:45,719
If you can.

943
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,404
Want to get something to eat?

944
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,175
Yeah.

945
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:18,591
Everybody is kung fu fighting

946
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,760
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

947
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:27,098
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

948
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:31,761
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

949
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:37,936
Everybody is kung fu fighting

950
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:42,445
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

951
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:46,784
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

952
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:51,115
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

953
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:55,156
You are a natural

954
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,460
Why is that so hard to see?

955
01:23:57,565 --> 01:24:01,695
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me

956
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:05,832
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know

957
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:09,809
But sometimes you've got to go
And be your own hero

958
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,813
Everybody is kung fu fighting

959
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:17,379
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

960
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,821

961
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:26,155
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

962
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:32,129
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

963
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:36,296
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

964
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:40,171
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

965
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:44,610
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

966
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:47,807
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

967
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:52,143
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

968
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:56,482

It's the book of your life

You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

971
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:11,595
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

972
