1
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,234
We come in peace
for cats and mice everywhere.

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,640
Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

3
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,952
<i>Itchy... Itchy...</i>

4
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,634
Boring!

5
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,831
Dad, we can't see the movie.

6
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,828
I can't believe we're paying to see
something we get on TV for free.

7
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,635
If you ask me, everybody in this
theater is a giant sucker.

8
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,191
Especially you.

9
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,470
<i>Movie on the big screen!</i>

10
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,636
Excuse me.
My heinie is dipping.

11
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,636
All right, well,
thanks a lot for coming.

12
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,149
We've been playing
for three and a half hours.

13
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,512
Now we'd like just a minute of your time
to say something about the environment.

14
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,275
- You suck!
- Shut up and play!

15
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,835
- Preachy!
- We're not being preachy.

16
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,079
But the pollution in your lake,
it's dissolving our barge.

17
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,191
I thought they touched
on a vital issue.

18
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,277
I beg to differ.

19
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,196
Gentlemen, it's been an honor
playing with you tonight.

20
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,072
For the latest rock band
to die in our town...

21
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,236
...Lord, hear our prayer.

22
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,949
Lord, hear our prayer.

23
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,039
I hate being late.

24
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,309
Well, I hate going.

25
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,476
Why can't I worship the Lord
in my own way...

26
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,398
...by praying like hell
on my deathbed?

27
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,238
Homer, they can hear you inside.

28
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,560
Relax. Those pious morons are too busy
talking to their phony-baloney God.

29
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,273
How you doing? Peace be with you.
Praise Jebus.

30
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,475
Today I'd like to try something
a little different.

31
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,830
I'm going to call on one of you!

32
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,789
Now, the word of God
dwells within everyone.

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,232
I want you to let that word out.
Let your spirit...

34
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,789
What is it, Ned?

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,355
The good Lord is telling me
to confess to something.

36
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,471
Gay, gay, gay.

37
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,672
An immodest sense of pride
in our community.

38
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,628
Somebody else?

39
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,868
Let the Lord's light
shine upon you.

40
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,909
Feel the spirit.

41
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,198
Let it out!

42
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,551
Horrible, horrible things
are going to happen!

43
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,949
And they're gonna happen to you!
And you! And you! And you.

44
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,513
Whoa, Nelly!

45
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,758
People of Springfield,
heed this warning:

46
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,109
Twisted tail!

47
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,514
A thousand eyes!

48
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,870
Trapped forever!

49
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,795
Dad, do something!

50
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,718
This book doesn't have any answers!

51
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,309
Beware! Beware! Time is short!

52
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,154
Believe me! Believe me!

53
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,796
Thanks for listening.

54
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,952
Okay, who wants waffles?

55
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,229
I do, I do, I do!

56
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,873
Wait a minute. 
What about Grampa?

57
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,593
- I want syrup!
- I want strawberries!

58
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,392
Something happened to that man.

59
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,071
I'll tell you what happened to him.
A certain someone had a senior moment.

60
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,877
But that's okay, because we love him
and we got a free rug out of it.

61
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,429
What is the point of going to church
every Sunday...

62
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,713
...when if someone we love has a genuine
religious experience, we ignore it?

63
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,638
Right, Grampa?

64
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,910
I want bananas on my waffles.

65
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,758
I rest my case.

66
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,155
I'm not dropping this.

67
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,994
Wait a minute. I'm still in the car.

68
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,031
Oh, right.

69
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,958
"Take out hornets' nest. "

70
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,276
Check. "Fix sinkhole. "

71
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,959
Check.

72
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,878
"Re-shingle roof"?

73
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,715
Steady.

74
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,674
Steady.

75
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,553
Why, you little...!

76
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,912
I'll teach you to laugh
at something that's funny!

77
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,998
You know, we are on the roof.
We could have some fun.

78
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,958
What kind of fun?

79
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,479
How about a dare contest?

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,719
That sounds fun. I dare you to...

81
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,399
...climb the TV antenna!

82
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,710
- Piece of cake.
- Earthquake!

83
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,031
Aftershock!

84
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,760
Homer, I don't mean
to be a Nervous Pervis...

85
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,635
...but if he falls, couldn't that
make your boy a paraplege-arino?

86
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,314
Shut up, Flanders.

87
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,114
- Yeah, shut up, Flanders.
- Well said, boy.

88
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,956
Steady. Steady.

89
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,229
Steady...

90
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,789
Hello. Sorry to bother you
on a Sunday...

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,835
...but I'm sure you're as worried about
the pollution in Lake Springfield as I am.

92
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,033
Lake Springfield has higher levels
of mercury than ev...

93
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,670
Why, it's the little girl
who saved my cat.

94
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,233
Lake Springfield is...

95
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,472
Come on over, Lisa.

96
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,433
You can canvass me
as long as you want.

97
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,029
Milhouse, you don't care
about the environment.

98
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,800
Hey. I am very passionate
about the planet.

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,228
Say global warming is a myth.

100
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,716
It's a myth! Further study is needed!

101
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,912
That's for selling out your beliefs.

102
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,959
Oh, poor Milhouse.

103
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,711
Dream coming true.

104
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,309
Are you aware that a leaky faucet
can waste over...?

105
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,919
Two thousand gallons a year.

106
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,714
- Turning off lights can save...
- Enough energy to power Pittsburgh.

107
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,990
And if we kept our thermostats
at 68 in winter...

108
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,192
We'd be free from our dependency
on foreign oil in 17 years.

109
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,833
I'm Colin.

110
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,598
I haven't seen you at school.

111
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,597
Moved from Ireland.
My dad's a musician.

112
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,313
- Is he...?
- He's not Bono.

113
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,796
- I just thought, because you're Irish and...
- He's not Bono.

114
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,355
Do you play?

115
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,516
Just piano, guitar, trumpet,
drums and bass.

116
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,993
<i>He's pure gold.
For once in your life, be cool.</i>

117
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,192
So is your name as pretty
as your face?

118
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,752
You okay there?

119
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,519
<i>Twisted tail! A thousand eyes!
Trapped forever!</i>

120
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,632
What could that be?

121
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,035
I believe it's the sound
the Green Lantern made...

122
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,152
...when Sinestro threw him
into a vat of acid.

123
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,437
Yeah. Thanks for coming over.

124
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,710
Thanks for giving me
your pregnancy pants.

125
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,200
Never known comfort like this.

126
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,833
Why did I suggest this?

127
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,590
All right, boy,
time for the ultimate dare.

128
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,031
I dare you to skateboard
to Krusty Burger and back...

129
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,992
...naked.

130
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,032
- How naked?
- Fourth base.

131
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,355
Girls might see my doodle.

132
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,315
Oh, I see. Then I hereby
declare you chicken for life.

133
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,308
Every morning, you'll wake up to
"Good morning, chicken. "

134
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,238
At your wedding, I'll sing:

135
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,837
I like men now.

136
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,073
Don't look where I'm pointing!

137
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,757
Stop in the name of
American squeamishness!

138
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,873
Boys, before we eat, don't forget
to thank the Lord for this bountiful...

139
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,035
Penis?!

140
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,117
- Bountiful penis.
- Bountiful penis.

141
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,389
Amen.

142
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,315
Listen, kid, nobody likes wearing clothes
in public, but, you know, it's the law.

143
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,272
Lunchtime!

144
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,198
You can't just leave me out here.

145
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,676
Don't worry, we found
a friend for you to play with.

146
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,878
Nelson, honey, where have you been?

147
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,759
- Dad!
- What seems to be the problem, officers?

148
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,712
Tell him you dared me to do it.

149
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,471
If that's true, then you should be
taking the rap here, not your son.

150
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,151
And what happens to me
if it's my fault?

151
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,033
You'll have to attend
a one-hour parenting class.

152
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,708
It was all his idea!
He's out of control, I tell you!

153
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,069
I'm at my wits' end.

154
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,352
It's so...

155
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,597
See you in court, kid.

156
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,836
Okay, son, let's get some lunch.

157
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,632
Did you at least bring my clothes?

158
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,678
Shirt, socks, everything you need.

159
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,350
- You didn't bring my pants.
- Who am I, Tommy Bahama?

160
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,272
This is the worst day of my life.

161
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,392
The worst day of your life so far.

162
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,394
- Say, Bart?
- What do you want, Flanders?

163
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,194
If you need pants,
I carry an extra pair.

164
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,994
You know how boys are,
always praying through the knees.

165
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,350
Why are you helping me?
I'm not your kid.

166
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,348
We're neighbors. I'm sure your father
would do the same for my boys.

167
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,913
Thank you.

168
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,554
- Hey, what's with you?
- You really wanna know?

169
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,034
Of course I do.

170
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,595
What kind of a father
wouldn't care about...?

171
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,949
A pig wearing a hat!

172
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,235
Action.

173
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,197
Hey, hey! It's your old pal Krusty,
for my new pork sandwich, the Klogger.

174
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,110
If you can find a greasier sandwich,
you're in Mexico!

175
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,270
And we're clear.

176
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,277
Perfect. Cut, print, kill the pig.

177
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,232
What...?! You can't kill him
if he's wearing people clothes!

178
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,635
You're coming home with me.

179
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,954
"A thousand eyes. "
What could that be?

180
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,749
I'm pretty sure
a thousand is a number.

181
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,511
Hey, Marge. Isn't it great being married
to someone who's recklessly impulsive?

182
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,631
Actually, it's aged me horribly.

183
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,638
Then say hello
to the newest Simpson.

184
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,873
Homer!

185
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,951
I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

186
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,116
Please, get rid of that pig.

187
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,075
Oh, you're gonna love him.
Look, he does an impression of you.

188
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,596
You nailed her.

189
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,598
He also does me.

190
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,675
You smiled. I'm off the hook.

191
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,271
Oh, you have so many looks.

192
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,438
So that's what snug is.

193
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,790
Who's a good pig?

194
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,550
Who's a good pig?

195
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,076
Rough day, huh, son?

196
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,513
You don't know what rough is, sister.

197
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,678
Bart, you know, whenever my boys
bake up a batch of frownies...

198
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,154
...I take them fishing.

199
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,430
Does your dad ever take you fishing?

200
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,916
Dad, it's not fair to use a bug zapper
to catch the fish.

201
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,476
If you love fish like I do,
you want them to die with dignity.

202
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,399
I think I have a nibble.

203
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,235
I think fishing might be
more fun with you.

204
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,113
Oh, great. Now, how about
I fix you some cocoa?

205
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,117
No way. Cocoa's for wusses.

206
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,073
Well, sir, if you change your mind,
it's on the windowsill.

207
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,959
Oh, my God.

208
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,598
Oh, wait. I didn't tell you the best part.
He loves the environment.

209
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,191
Oh, wait! I still didn't tell you
the best part. He's got an Irish brogue.

210
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,868
No, no, wait!
I still didn't tell you the best part.

211
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,798
He's not imaginary!

212
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,911
Oh, honey, that's great.

213
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,829
But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

214
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,191
Because nothing means more
than for a man to...

215
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,073
How did the pig tracks
get on the ceiling?

216
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,350
<i>Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig</i>

217
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,915
<i>Does whatever a Spider-Pig does</i>

218
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,270
<i>Can he swing from a web?</i>

219
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,436
<i>No, he can't, he's a pig</i>

220
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,349
<i>Look out
He is the Spider-Pig</i>

221
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,559
Are we having fun yet?

222
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,432
We are now. You've got a bite.

223
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,870
Whoa, mama!

224
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,678
Oh, no, my good pole!

225
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,758
You're not strangling me.

226
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,269
What the...?
Strangling's only good for...

227
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,518
Well, it's not good for anything.

228
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,676
The only time you should
lay hands on a boy...

229
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,632
...is to give him
a good pat on the back.

230
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,671
Hey, what the hell are you...?

231
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,072
One more time.

232
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,390
Honey, I'm home.

233
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,711
We are at the tipping point, people.

234
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,638
If we don't do something now...

235
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,670
I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Isn't he dreamy?

236
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,949
Agreed.

237
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,593
Okay, so here's the bottom line:

238
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,791
If we don't change our ways
right now...

239
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,629
...pollution in Lake Springfield
will be at this level.

240
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,794
That's not so bad.

241
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,753
No, the lift is stuck.

242
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,835
Am I getting through to anyone?

243
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,474
Hell, yeah.
We need a new one of those things.

244
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,875
All in favor of a new scissor lift,
say "aye. "

245
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,752
- Aye.
- No!

246
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,793
This lake is just one piece of trash
away from a toxic nightmare.

247
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,353
But I knew you wouldn't listen.

248
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,189
So I took the liberty of pouring water
from the lake in all your drinking glasses.

249
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,111
This is why we should hate kids.

250
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,719
This is serious, people.

251
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,118
No more dumping in the lake.
I hereby declare a state of emergency.

252
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,594
Code black.

253
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,275
Black? That's the worst color there is.

254
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,119
- No offense there, Carl.
- I get it all the time.

255
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,029
Sorry, sorry. No dumping in the lake.

256
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,837
Fine. I will put my yard trimmings
in a car compactor.

257
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,030
Chief, I think there was
a dead body in there.

258
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,357
I thought that too,
until he said "yard trimmings. "

259
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,198
You gotta learn to listen, Lou.

260
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,552
Let us now make sure
this barrier is completely idiot-proof.

261
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,671
- Cletus.
- Yessum?

262
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,836
Try to dump something in the lake.

263
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,678
Okay.

264
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,039
I can't. I simply can't.

265
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,753
- Brilliant.
- Very effective.

266
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,788
Don't get any ideas.

267
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,915
Maybe we should kiss,
just to break the tension.

268
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,951
What's going on here?

269
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,195
Nothing. Nothing.

270
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,630
I'm not sure that pig
should be in the house.

271
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,674
And by the way,
what are you doing with his leavings?

272
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,509
Don't worry.
I've devised a most elegant solution.

273
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,033
It's leaking.

274
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,630
It's not leaking, it's overflowing.

275
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,628
He filled up the whole silo
in just two days?

276
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,795
Well, I helped.

277
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,074
Homer, stop! Stop. I know it's easy
for your mind to wander...

278
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,833
...but I want you to
really concentrate on me.

279
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,636
I can't escape the feeling that this
is the crisis Grampa warned us about.

280
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,877
You have to dispose
of that waste properly.

281
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,317
Okay, Marge. I will.

282
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,351
You can take Spider-Pig with you.

283
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,757
He's not Spider-Pig anymore,
he's Harry Plopper.

284
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,915
Hello.

285
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,439
Homer, you gotta get over here.

286
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,110
Health inspector shut down the doughnut
store, they're giving out free doughnuts!

287
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,153
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I just got one thing I gotta do first.

288
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,670
Well, you better hurry.
They're going fast.

289
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,391
Whoa, that was close.

290
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,268
<i>Evil!</i>

291
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,836
Drive, drive, drive!

292
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,838
Oh, right.

293
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,437
Look at that. You can see
the four states that border Springfield:

294
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,155
Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

295
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,635
Oh, yeah.

296
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,037
And if you look real close,
you can almost...

297
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,636
Well, this certainly seems odd...

298
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,389
...but who am I to question
the work of the Almighty?

299
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,513
We thank you, Lord,
for this mighty fine intelligent design.

300
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,517
Good job.

301
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,316
Jabbity, jabbity, jab, jab, jab!

302
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,590
Hey! Jab one more eye
and it's a federal crime.

303
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,439
- Who are you?
- Environmental Protection Agency.

304
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,352
Russ Cargill, head of the EPA,
here to see the president.

305
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,829
Mr. President.

306
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,389
<i>Ja, that is me.</i>

307
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,115
Pollution in Springfield
has reached crisis levels.

308
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,959
I hate this job. Everything's "crisis" this
and "end of the world" that.

309
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,879
Nobody opens with a joke.
I miss Danny De Vito.

310
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,595
You want a joke, huh?
Stop me if you've heard this one.

311
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,638
Look at those angry eyes
and giant teeth.

312
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,717
It's like Christmas
at the Kennedy compound.

313
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,873
You know, sir, when you
made me head of the EPA...

314
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,311
...you appointed one of
the most successful men in America...

315
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,590
...to the least successful agency
in government.

316
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,631
And why did I take the job?

317
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,434
Because I'm a rich man
who wanted to give something back.

318
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,119
Not the money, but something.

319
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,313
So here is our chance to
kick some ass for Mother Earth.

320
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,114
- I'm listening.
- Well, I've narrowed your choices down...

321
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,197
...to five unthinkable options.

322
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,913
Each will cause untold misery...

323
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,553
I pick number three.

324
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,273
You don't wanna read them first?

325
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,950
I was elected to lead, not to read.
Number three!

326
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,393
We're being sealed in a dome!

327
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,278
What do I do?
I don't know what to do!

328
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,516
If I stay, I'm trapped.
If I leave, I'm alone.

329
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,312
Oh, God. In, out, in, out!

330
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,555
I never saw Venice.

331
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,159
"Trapped forever. "

332
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,590
It's all come true.

333
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,236
That crazy old man in church
was right.

334
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,989
Dome!

335
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,758
All right, men, open fire.

336
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,592
Who's hurt? Raise your hands.

337
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,475
Without the attitude.

338
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,148
People, people.
I have an important announcement.

339
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,438
I have just perfected
an acid-firing super-drill...

340
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,473
...which can cut through anything.
- Hey, that's cool.

341
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,795
It's right there.

342
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,549
Just outside of the dome.

343
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,556
What ruthless madmen
could have done this to us?

344
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,273
<i>The United States government.</i>

345
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,075
<i>My name is Russ Cargill
and I'm head of the EPA.</i>

346
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,475
The what?

347
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,035
<i>- Environmental Protection Agency.
- Come again?</i>

348
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,470
<i>Look, I'm a man on a big TV.
Just listen.</i>

349
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,149
<i>- Springfield has become...
- Springfield!</i>

350
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,755
<i>- the most polluted city
in the history of the planet.</i>

351
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,234
Drama queen!

352
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,438
<i>To keep your poisons
from spreading...</i>

353
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,631
<i>...your government has sealed you
in this dome.</i>

354
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,998
<i>It's the last thing we wanted to do.</i>

355
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,634
<i>I own the company that makes
the dome, but that's beside the point.</i>

356
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,478
You mean we're trapped like rats?

357
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,629
<i>No, rats can't be trapped this easily.
You're trapped like carrots.</i>

358
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,952
Wait. We couldn't be more polluted.
Everyone stopped dumping in the lake.

359
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,230
<i>Apparently someone
didn't get the message.</i>

360
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,957
Act natural.

361
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,516
Hey, buddy, sooner or later,
people are gonna discover this.

362
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,349
<i>Don't worry about that. We found
a way to take you off the map.</i>

363
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,070
<i>Coming up on your right:</i>

364
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,838
<i>Nothing.</i>

365
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,072
This is Kent Brockman,
reporting to you on a crisis so serious...

366
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,236
...it has its own name
and theme music.

367
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,356
The dome has put an end
to life as we know it.

368
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,475
The town is running low on supplies of
everything from gasoline to Botox.

369
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,557
Moment, please.

370
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,757
Now, as always, we end our news
on "The Lighter Side. "

371
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,236
It's the time of year when
the swallows return to Springfield.

372
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,149
I think the thing I miss most
is a simple summer breeze.

373
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,478
Maggie?

374
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,116
<i>We've got dome wax, dome polish,
dome freshener, all your dome needs...</i>

375
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,555
<i>...at Dome Depot,
located at the 105 and the dome.</i>

376
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,830
<i>Dome Depot!</i>

377
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,951
Maggie got out! Maggie got out!

378
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,995
Maggie was right there,
just outside the dome.

379
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,350
Marge, she's right here.

380
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,513
This dome can play tricks on you.
You just have to keep calm and...

381
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,869
Oh, my God.

382
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,551
I'm out of the dome.
Fresh air! Freedom!

383
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,038
I'll write you. Lead good lives!

384
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,237
<i>Good evening, 
this is Kent Brockman.</i>

385
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,034
<i>Efforts to find out
whose selfish crime...</i>

386
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,470
<i>...caused our entrapment
have been fruitless.</i>

387
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,475
<i>Until moments ago!</i>

388
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,875
<i>A shocking discovery has been made
here at Lake Springfield.</i>

389
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,915
That could be anybody's pig-crap silo.

390
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,349
Homer, it was you.

391
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,120
You single-handedly killed this town.

392
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,470
I know. It's weird.

393
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,956
<i>Just a reminder, this station does not
endorse vigilante justice.</i>

394
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,674
<i>Unless it gets results. Which it will.</i>

395
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,319
You didn't listen to me
after I warned you.

396
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,910
Don't worry,
nobody watches this stupid show.

397
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,236
What's that ominous glow
in the distance?

398
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,315
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

399
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,396
Marge, look. Those idiots
don't even know where we live.

400
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,432
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

401
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,439
<i>We want Homer! We want Homer!</i>

402
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,313
You monster. You monster!

403
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,875
Did you see the news?

404
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,911
Honey, come on,
we have bigger problems.

405
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,270
But I'm so angry.

406
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,790
You're a woman.
You can hold on to it forever.

407
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,548
Okay.

408
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,994
Homer, you have to go out there,
face that mob...

409
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,395
...and apologize for what you did.

410
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,717
I would, but I'm afraid if I open the door,
they'll take all of you.

411
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,831
No, we won't. 
We just want Homer!

412
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,156
Well, maybe not you,
but they'll kill Grampa.

413
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,998
I'm part of the mob!

414
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,477
Teeny! Take out the baby.

415
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,996
Here, let me get that for you.

416
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,034
Stay back. I got a chain saw.

417
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,875
Bart!

418
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,479
Crawl across. Hurry.

419
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,875
But if they see you helping us,
they'll kill you.

420
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,594
I'm sure your father would
do the same for...

421
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,075
Point taken. 
Now, hustle your bustles.

422
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,919
Archers.

423
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,988
I'm using a red arrow
so I know who I kill.

424
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,273
No, Plopper.
If you push that, Daddy will die.

425
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,233
Hey, my luck's beginning to turn.

426
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,398
Wait! 
There's something I have to get.

427
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,758
- What'd you get?
- Our wedding video.

428
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,310
- We have a wedding video?
- Torch his gas tank!

429
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,157
We lost them.

430
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,673
Up here.

431
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,995
Get them! Get them!

432
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,914
Little help?

433
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,954
You know, the word "apology"...

434
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:43,632
...is tossed around a lot these days,
but when it comes from in here...

435
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,479
Mom, what are we gonna do?

436
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,874
Maggie, not now.

437
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,635
We'll play later.

438
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,272
The sinkhole. Follow me, kids!

439
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,471
- Geronimo!
- Sacajawea!

440
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,068
So long, losers!

441
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,072
The top of his head is still showing.
Claw at it!

442
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,394
Well, they're China's problem now.

443
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,075
Colin!

444
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,676
I can't hear you!

445
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,232
I never thought my life would have an
absolutely perfect moment, but this is...

446
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,796
Lisa's got a boyfriend
that she'll never see again!

447
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,758
perfect.

448
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,509
- What do we do?
- Now we run.

449
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,798
I'm afraid we lost them, sir.

450
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,274
Damn it!

451
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,278
Well, then, you find them
and you get them back in the dome.

452
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,833
And so nobody else gets out...

453
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,600
...I want roving death squads
around the perimeter 24/7.

454
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,028
I want 10,000 tough guys...

455
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,312
...and I want 10,000 soft guys
to make the tough guys look tougher.

456
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,592
And here's how I want them arranged:
Tough, tough, soft, tough...

457
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,590
...soft, soft, tough, tough,
soft, soft, tough, soft.

458
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,998
Sir, I'm afraid you've
gone mad with power.

459
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,034
Of course. Ever try going mad without
power? It's boring. No one listens to you.

460
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,158
- Bart, are you drinking whiskey?
- I'm troubled.

461
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,510
- Bart.
- I promise, I'll stop tomorrow.

462
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,029
You'll stop right now.

463
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,559
You come back here, little man.

464
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,638
I miss Flanders. There, I said it!

465
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,957
- Where's your father?
- He went out.

466
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,515
Let's quickly rebuild our lives
while he's gone.

467
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,278
Hey, guys?

468
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,154
What's the secret knock, again?

469
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,230
Look, I know I screwed up. This is big.

470
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,715
It's huge! We're homeless!

471
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,911
Our friends wanna kill us!

472
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,429
Before we can even stay
in the same room with you...

473
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,995
...I need to know what was
going through your mind...

474
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,395
...when you didn't listen to me...

475
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,956
...and dumped that silo in the lake.

476
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,355
Homer!

477
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,030
I don't know what to tell you, Marge.
I don't think about things.

478
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,276
I respect people who do...

479
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,759
...but I just try to make the days not hurt
until I get to crawl in next to you again.

480
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,469
I mean, oh.

481
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,674
Look, I'm really sorry.
But I'm more than just sorry...

482
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,632
...I'm prepared with a solution.

483
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,239
I've always been afraid I'd screw up our
lives so badly we'd need a backup plan.

484
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,953
And that plan is right here!

485
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,995
No.

486
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,235
Nope.

487
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,998
Bingo.

488
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,794
Bear with me.

489
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,635
Alaska?

490
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,628
Alaska. A place where you can't be
too fat or too drunk.

491
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,432
Where no one says things like:

492
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,871
"Let's see your high school
equivalency certificate. "

493
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,118
I don't know, Homie.

494
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,639
I'm not saying it right.

495
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,389
Look, the thing is,
I can't start a new life alone.

496
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,239
And I've really come to like you guys.

497
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,468
I just don't see it.

498
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,869
Marge, in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

499
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,230
"I need you to do this with me. "

500
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,956
And there's only one answer
when somebody says that.

501
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,351
Okay, Homie, I'm with you.

502
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,152
Thank you, my sweetheart.

503
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,432
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

504
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,792
You just bought
another load of crap...

505
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,912
...from the world's fattest
fertilizer salesman.

506
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,509
You'll pay for ruining
this golden family moment!

507
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,675
Homer!

508
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,031
How are we supposed to get to Alaska
without any money?

509
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,518
All right, son. If you don't believe in me,
believe in America.

510
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,996
America. Where any man can make
quick money with no questions asked.

511
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,471
Step right up and win my truck!

512
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,831
All you have to do is conquer
the Ball of Death.

513
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,359
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

514
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,314
Just ride the motorcycle
all the way around just one time.

515
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,511
Three tries for $ 10.

516
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,872
- Marge, how much money do we have?
- Ten dollars.

517
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,679
That counts as a try.

518
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,472
That's two.

519
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,869
And that's three.

520
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,719
Here's what I'll do,
because I like seeing you hurt yourself:

521
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,319
I'll give you one on the house.

522
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,272
- You're the best.
- Dad!

523
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,995
When you get to the top,
don't slow down, speed up!

524
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,033
- But that's when it's the scariest.
- Just do it!

525
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,113
Yes!

526
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,957
Yay, Dad!

527
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,836
I'll take that truck now.

528
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,789
Oh, man. My wives are gonna kill me.

529
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,350
Next stop, Alaska!

530
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,831
<i>Day 37 under the dome.</i>

531
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,749
<i>We are facing intermittent
power failures which...</i>

532
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,877
Okay, very funny.
I'm gonna turn the lights off again.

533
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,038
When they come back on,
I want all my booze back the way it was.

534
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,478
Yeah, okay. Okay.

535
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,714
I'm very proud of you, Bart.
Over 24 hours sober.

536
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,115
- You are, aren't you?
- I'll prove it.

537
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,515
We're giving your father another chance,
and we owe it to him to...

538
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,279
- Oh, my God.
- Can I help you?

539
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,153
We need diapers.

540
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,476
- Okay.
- No. No, we don't. We don't.

541
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,511
- Ladies' razorblades.
- Right.

542
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,554
No! No. No, we don't.
I forgot, we're European.

543
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,433
Just give us beef jerky.

544
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,279
Lots and lots of beef jerky.

545
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,233
That's right. That's what we need.
That's all we came in for.

546
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,714
Sure.

547
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,036
Oh, my God. There they are!

548
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,594
So you want some of my electricity,
do you?

549
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,991
Well, for once,
the rich white man is in control.

550
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,236
I have two buttons behind this desk.

551
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,877
One will supply your town with power,
the other releases the hounds.

552
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,754
Reach me. Make me your brother.

553
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,070
The hospital's generator
is about to give out.

554
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,474
Lives will be lost.

555
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,270
"Lives lost. " Go on.

556
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,472
We got a convict we were gonna
fry tomorrow, but now we can't.

557
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,955
Tempting. Tempting.

558
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,798
Look, all our reasons mean nothing.

559
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,549
Just look into your heart
and you'll find the answer.

560
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,599
- First door on the right.
- Thank you.

561
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,955
What...? This isn't the way
I pictured Alaska at all!

562
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,559
Oh, that's better.

563
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,432
Homer!

564
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,319
Well, at least my poster
didn't get torn.

565
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,112
Welcome to Alaska. Here's $ 1000.

566
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,788
Well, it's about time! But why?

567
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,877
We pay every resident $ 1000...

568
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,878
...to allow oil companies to ravage
our state's natural beauty.

569
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,071
I'm home!

570
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,077
Oh, thanks.

571
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,558
What are you doing, Bart?

572
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,159
Just passing the time.

573
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,676
My boy loves Alaska so much,
he's applauding it.

574
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,235
- Lisa, why aren't you clapping?
- But, Dad...

575
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,839
Clap for Alaska!

576
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,518
Well, Marge, we're separated
from the kids by a wall of snow.

577
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,315
All my dreams are coming true.

578
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,712
We're going to need more birds.

579
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,078
Day 93 under the dome.

580
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,475
With necessities growing
dangerously low...

581
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,513
...who knows what spark will set off
this powder keg?

582
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,996
<i>- Let's discuss Tuesdays with Morrie.
- Again?</i>

583
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,760
If we don't get a new book,
I'm going to puke.

584
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,475
You're the five people
I'm going to meet in hell!

585
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,271
We're out of coffee!

586
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,437
I can't take another minute
in this dome!

587
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,637
Take that.

588
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,399
Oh, no! Blowback!

589
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,192
Look what they're doing to our dome.

590
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,714
You know what that is, sir?

591
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,558
- A crack?
- Exactly.

592
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,797
People got out of the dome before,
they're gonna get out again.

593
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,719
When they do, there's gonna be
hearings, investigations...

594
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,515
I'll have to go back to
making family comedies.

595
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,396
Don't worry,
I have a solution for you, sir.

596
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,034
In fact, I have five solutions.

597
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,595
You don't have to read them.
You'll have deniability.

598
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,518
I'll take care of it. You know nothing.

599
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,397
No. I need to know
what I'm approving.

600
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,354
Absolutely. But on the other hand,
knowing things is overrated.

601
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,790
Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is.

602
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,197
It takes real leadership to pick
something you're clueless about.

603
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,719
- Okay, I pick three.
- Try again.

604
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,638
- One. Five?
- Go higher. Too high.

605
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,909
- Three?
- You said three.

606
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,838
- Six? Two?
- There is no six. Double it.

607
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,314
- Four!
- As you wish, sir.

608
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,870
<i>Are you tired of
the same old Grand Canyon?</i>

609
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,833
Here we are, kids, the Grand Canyon.

610
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,192
It's so old and boring.
I want a new one. Now!

611
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,436
Hello. I'm Tom Hanks.

612
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,835
The U.S. government
has lost its credibility...

613
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,632
...so it's borrowing some of mine.

614
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,159
Tousle my hair, Mr. Hanks.

615
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,237
Sure thing, son.

616
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,878
Now, I'm pleased to tell you all
about the New Grand Canyon.

617
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,435
<i>This weekend. East of Shelbyville
and south of Capitol City.</i>

618
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,433
That's where Springfield is!

619
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,915
It's nowhere near where
anything is or ever was.

620
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,235
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

621
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,318
If you're going to pick a government
to trust, why not this one?

622
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,795
Did you see that?

623
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,594
Yes, they're going
to destroy Springfield.

624
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,472
But we're going to stop them.

625
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,353
Homie, get your clothes on. Homie?

626
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,755
I'm happy here. Screw Springfield!

627
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,072
I can't believe you'd say
something so selfish.

628
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,317
Marge, those people chased us
with pitchforks and torches.

629
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,795
Torches! At 4 in the afternoon!

630
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,673
<i>- It was 7 at night.
- It was during Access Hollywood.</i>

631
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,632
Which is on at 4 and 7.

632
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,511
Dad, how can you turn your back
on everyone who loved us?

633
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,438
Flanders helped
when we were in trouble.

634
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,596
Who cares what he did?
He's not your father.

635
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,915
I wish he was.

636
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,031
You don't mean that.
You worship me.

637
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,470
Oh, yeah?
Look what I did to your picture.

638
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,075
Look at it.

639
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,072
How-dilly-doo-dilly.
How-dilly-doo-dilly.

640
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,679
Why, you little...!

641
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,119
I'll strangle-angle you!

642
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,548
Diddily-diddily.

643
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,990
Bart, stop it! Leave this to me.

644
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,952
Homer...

645
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,870
...in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

646
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,038
"I need you to do this with me. "

647
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,989
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

648
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,315
Homer Simpson!

649
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,999
We're saving Springfield!

650
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,270
Listen to me, all of you.
We are staying.

651
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,959
We have a great life in Alaska...

652
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,277
...and we're never going
back to America again.

653
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,357
I have spoken!

654
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,109
Well, I guess I've let her
worry about me long enough.

655
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,234
Marge? Kids?

656
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,837
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>

657
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,359
<i>Homer...</i>

658
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,437
<i>...I've always stood up for you.</i>

659
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,632
<i>When people point out your flaws...</i>

660
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,558
<i>...I always say:</i>

661
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,629
<i>"Well, sometimes you have to
stand back to appreciate a work of art. "</i>

662
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,273
Way back.

663
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,597
<i>Lately, what's keeping us together...</i>

664
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,873
<i>...is my ability to overlook
everything you do.</i>

665
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,675
<i>And I overlook these things
because...</i>

666
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,194
Because?

667
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,230
<i>Well, that's the thing.</i>

668
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,513
<i>I just don't know how to finish
that sentence anymore.</i>

669
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,909
<i>So I'm leaving with the kids
to help Springfield...</i>

670
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,634
<i>...and we're never coming back.</i>

671
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,115
<i>And to prove to myself
that this is the end...</i>

672
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,029
<i>...I taped this over our wedding video.</i>

673
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,316
<i>Goodbye, Homie.</i>

674
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,799
<i>I love you.</i>

675
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,555
Marge? Kids?

676
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,593
- So, Mom, what's our plan?
- What are you doing up there?

677
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,438
Looking through people's luggage.

678
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,438
I'm the mascot of an evil corporation.

679
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,996
Get down from there.
We have to keep a low profile...

680
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,113
...till we get to Seattle to tell the world
of the plot to destroy Springfield.

681
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,709
I don't know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

682
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,038
Oh, Lisa, it's not like the government
is listening to everybody's conversation.

683
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,270
<i>Hi, I'm calling about
your Meat Lover's pizza.</i>

684
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,472
<i>I like meat, but I don't know
if I'm ready to love again.</i>

685
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,797
<i>- You hang up first.
- No, you hang up first.</i>

686
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,274
<i>Okay.</i>

687
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,232
<i>She hung up on me!</i>

688
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,592
<i>But we're fugitives. We should
just lay low till we get to Seattle.</i>

689
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,592
Hey, everybody, I found one!

690
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,509
The government actually found
someone we're looking for!

691
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,472
Yeah, baby, yeah!

692
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,354
Homer Simpson...

693
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,958
...do you know why you are here?

694
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,914
Because my family cares more about
other people than they do about me.

695
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,395
Drink this liquid.

696
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,193
More, please.

697
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,951
Now we will cleanse your spirit...

698
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,232
...by the ancient Inuit art
of throat singing.

699
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,476
Throat singing?

700
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,113
How long are we doing this?

701
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,917
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

702
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,229
What's an epiphany?

703
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,352
Sudden realization of great truth.

704
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,515
Okay.

705
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,916
<i>Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig</i>

706
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,351
<i>Does whatever a Spider-Pig does</i>

707
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,629
<i>Look out!</i>

708
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,868
<i>He's a Spider-Pig</i>

709
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,396
Unless you have an epiphany...

710
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,354
...you will spend the remainder
of your days alone.

711
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,548
Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

712
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,550
Bananas are an excellent source
of potassium.

713
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,193
Americans will never embrace soccer?

714
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,038
More than two shakes
and it's playing with yourself?

715
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,676
Hey, what are you doing?

716
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,676
Oh, do whatever you want to me.
I don't care about myself anymore.

717
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,675
<i>Because...?</i>

718
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,478
Because other people
are just as important as me.

719
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,799
Without them, I'm nothing.

720
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,751
In order to save myself...

721
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,394
...I have to save Springfield!

722
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,353
That's it! Isn't it?

723
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,238
That was the most
incredible experience of my life.

724
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,434
And now to find my family,
save my town and drop 10 pounds!

725
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,432
Thank you, boob lady.

726
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,832
This is it, kids. Seattle.

727
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,918
Russ Cargill! Do you think he saw us?

728
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,999
Yes, I did.

729
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,392
Run! Run!

730
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,552
Run! Run!

731
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,758
Run! Run!

732
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,317
Jump! Jump!

733
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,431
Land! Land!

734
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,757
Rest! Rest!

735
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,759
Run! Run!

736
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,311
Now, I know we've had a rough day...

737
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,353
...but I'm sure we can put all that
behind us and...

738
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,912
That's my whipping arm!

739
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,435
Why does everything I whip leave me?

740
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,679
Must keep going. Must keep going.

741
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,668
No, I can't. I can't keep going.

742
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,871
Yes, you can.

743
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,798
No, I can't!

744
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,592
Oh, shut up!

745
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,313
You shut up.

746
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,272
No, you. No, you.

747
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,153
No, you. Oh, real mature.

748
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,555
How could you say that?

749
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,671
Oh, what's the point?

750
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,110
It's hopeless.

751
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,196
Don't give up, Homer.
You are closer than you think.

752
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,958
But which way do I go?

753
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,878
Much obliged.

754
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,676
Ten-hut!

755
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,790
Lisa! Knock off that racket.

756
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,955
Lisa!

757
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,635
They captured my family.
What do I do? What do I do?

758
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,273
There's something strange
about that "sop" sign.

759
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,716
- Did you hear something?
- Probably just a moth.

760
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,273
I hope it's okay.

761
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,870
Look, we can't keep stopping at
every "sop," "yeld" or "one vay" sign.

762
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,229
Just move on.

763
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,712
Let us out! Let us out!

764
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,990
Stop that.
You'll scratch your shackles.

765
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,156
I hope I do.

766
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,272
Oh, way to go, Bart.

767
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,799
You stink.

768
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,595
No, you stink.

769
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,912
Springfield.

770
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,470
I can't believe it,
but it got even crappier.

771
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,119
Oh, man.

772
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,475
Oh, hi, Midge.

773
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,671
Moe, what happened?

774
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,158
With the town sealed off from the rest of
the world, things got a little nutty here.

775
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,679
Why are you dressed like that?

776
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,112
Well, I don't like to brag,
but I am now the emperor of Springfield.

777
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,594
No, you're not!

778
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,995
Yes, I am!

779
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,628
Okay. Hail, emperor.

780
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,796
<i>Attention, Springfield.</i>

781
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,239
<i>Your government realized that putting you
inside this dome was a terrible mistake.</i>

782
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,637
<i>Therefore, we're commencing with
Operation Soaring Eagle.</i>

783
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,759
<i>Which involves killing you all.</i>

784
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,468
<i>As I speak, we're lowering a small
but powerful bomb into your midst.</i>

785
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,908
Despite everything, I miss your father.

786
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,712
Me too.

787
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,480
His big, fat ass could shield us all.

788
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,835
Ten-hut!

789
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,710
At ease. I'm General Marriott Suites...

790
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,195
...and I have an urgent note
from the president.

791
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,675
It says to release
this town immediately.

792
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,394
Why is it written on a leaf?

793
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,875
Perfect.

794
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,995
Now Homer Simpson's gonna show
he has cojones!

795
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,677
Mom, I've gotta go find Colin.

796
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,953
Not now, sweetie.
Doomsday is family time.

797
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,037
Hey. If one of us distracts Cargill,
the rest of us can climb up that thing.

798
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,869
Who'd be dumb enough to stay behind
while we escape with our lives?

799
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,630
My time to shine.

800
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,232
Hey, Mr. Big TV Man, lookie here!

801
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,073
<i>What do you want?</i>

802
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,272
Look what I can do with my thumb.

803
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,951
You wanna know how I do it?

804
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,355
<i>Four generations of inbreeding?</i>

805
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,958
I can smell fresh air.

806
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,836
I can hear birds.

807
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,235
I taste freedom.

808
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,476
Excuse me!
Watch out! Coming through!

809
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,479
<i>I was tricked by an idiot.</i>

810
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:42,073
Hey, I know how you feel.
I was beat in tic-tac-toe by a chicken.

811
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,679
<i>Goodbye.</i>

812
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,634
Homer do good?

813
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,750
Actually, you doomed us all. Again.
Nice knowing you, Homer.

814
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,279
But I...

815
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,754
I can't do anything right.

816
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,710
Get out of here!

817
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,508
I've spent my entire life doing nothing
but collecting comic books.

818
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,280
And now there's only time to say:

819
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,232
Life well spent!

820
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,556
Okay, boys. When you meet Jesus,
be sure to call him Mr. Christ.

821
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,478
Will Buddha be there too?

822
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,715
No.

823
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,758
- Hey, Flanders.
- Bart.

824
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,828
How good to see you.
And how terrible you're here.

825
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,678
Thanks.

826
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,158
Listen. I was just wondering if...

827
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,396
...before I died...

828
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,309
...I could pretend I had a father who...

829
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,873
...cared for me.

830
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,639
Come here, son.

831
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,991
There's always room for one more
in the Flanders clan.

832
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,751
Come on, bomb-disarming robot.
You're our last hope.

833
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,272
<i>Red wire. Blue wire.
Black is usually the ground.</i>

834
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,038
<i>So much pressure.</i>

835
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,354
<i>Pressure!</i>

836
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,192
He'd been talking about it,
but I didn't take him seriously.

837
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,155
Marge.

838
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,510
Marge! Marge!

839
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,517
Oh, no, the "epipha-tree"!

840
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,349
Hey, I tried my best.
What am I supposed to do?

841
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,677
But how am I
supposed to get up there?

842
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,080
Here. Buy yourself something nice.

843
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,114
Homer? What the hell
are you doing now?

844
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,072
Risking my life to save people I hate...

845
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,794
...for reasons I don't quite understand.
Gotta go!

846
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,111
But first, one stop.

847
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,314
Bart? Son?

848
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,431
You think you could find it
in your heart...

849
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,154
...to give your foolish old man
one more chance?

850
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,193
Oh, I don't know.

851
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,834
It seems to me, son,
that your father's saying that...

852
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,157
...he wants to spend
his last minute with you.

853
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,591
No. I can't do it.

854
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,788
I want a father who's the same
in the morning as he is at night.

855
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,228
What's that word?

856
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,668
- Consistency.
- Consistency.

857
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,279
Thanks, losers.

858
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,549
Sorry, Homer.

859
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,235
I'll let you hold the bomb.

860
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,953
The man knows me.

861
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,470
I wish Homer was my father.

862
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,513
And I wish you didn't have
the devil's curly hair.

863
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,035
I've been taking your crap all my life!

864
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,956
This feels good. No wonder you do it.

865
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,912
Okay, you've only got one shot
to throw that bomb through the hole.

866
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,350
Dad, in case I miss...

867
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,120
...I'm sorry I said I wished
you weren't my father.

868
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:33,357
I don't blame you, son.
I wasn't much of a father.

869
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,120
Maybe it starts with the way
my dad raised me.

870
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,518
Yes. It's clear to me. It's just been
one long, unbroken cycle of...

871
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,280
Somebody throw the goddamn bomb!

872
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,511
What? What's going on?

873
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,268
We did it, boy!

874
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,073
Dad?

875
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,913
It's amazing no one was hurt.

876
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,433
Bye, everybody.

877
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,831
Now, that was
a great father-son activity.

878
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,235
Hello, Homer.

879
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,589
So we meet at last, whoever you are.

880
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,712
There's two things they don't teach you
at Harvard Business School.

881
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,514
How to cope with defeat,
and how to handle a shotgun.

882
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,109
I'm going to do both right now.

883
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,390
Wait! If you kill my dad...

884
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,750
...you'll never know
where the treasure is buried.

885
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,949
What treasure?

886
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,873
The Treasure of Imawiener.

887
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,115
I'm a wiener?

888
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,915
Classic.

889
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,190
Well, always leave them laughing.

890
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,753
Goodbye, sir.

891
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:16,231
Maggie! What a great little accident
you turned out to be.

892
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,753
Colin? Colin!

893
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,873
Lisa? Colin's dead.

894
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,436
But his last words were:

895
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:34,033
"Milhouse, take care of Lisa.
Hold her hand. "

896
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,075
I got her all warmed up for you.

897
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,475
Colin. Hi.

898
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,716
- Hey, you wanna go...?
- Clean up the lake?

899
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,480
Well, I was gonna say
get some ice cream, but okay.

900
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,118
I like ice cream.

901
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,156
Kind of sweaty. Sorry.

902
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,868
Boy! You survived! How?

903
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,832
I did things no dog should do.

904
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,917
They will haunt me forever.

905
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,475
I love you too.

906
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:37,274
Best kiss of my life.

907
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,119
Best kiss of your life so far.

908
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,069
Steady.

909
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,150
Steady.

910
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,470
Steady.

911
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,033
Dad?

912
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,592
Thanks, boy.

913
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,155
Steady.

914
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,878
They've taken everything, sir.

915
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,915
Smithers, I don't believe in suicide...

916
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,510
...but if you'd like to try it,
it might cheer me up to watch.

917
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,914
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

918
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,873
If you see me in person,
please, leave me be.

919
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:03,029
<i>#Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig#</i>

920
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:07,189
<i>#Does whatever a Spider-Pig does#</i>

921
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,513
<i>#Can he swing from a web?#</i>

922
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,871
<i>#No, he can't, he's a pig#</i>

923
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,308
<i>#Look out!#</i>

924
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,389
<i>#He is a Spider-Pig#</i>

925
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,308
<i>#Look out!#</i>

926
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,513
<i>#He is a Spider-Pig#</i>

927
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:59,908
Come on, Dad, let's go. I've been holding
it since they put the dome over the town.

928
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,078
You can wait. A lot of people
worked really hard on this film...

929
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,239
...and all they ask is for you
to memorize their names.

930
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,749
Well, I wanna make sure
no animals were harmed...

931
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,793
...during the filming of this movie.

932
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,355
Okay.

933
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,395
Floor popcorn.

934
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,119
Wait, wait, wait! It looks like
Maggie has something to say.

935
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,993
Oh, my God. Her first word.

936
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,551
Sequel?

937
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,551
<i>Springfield doesn't have an anthem</i>

938
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,514
<i>We thought we had one
But we don't</i>

939
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:11,395
<i>We paid a short guy to write it</i>

940
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,229
<i>But we never saw him again</i>

941
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,069
<i>The tune we stole from the French</i>

942
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,511
<i>There's a few things they do well</i>

943
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:26,599
<i>Like making love, wine and cheese</i>

944
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,588
<i>Like Roqueforts, Camemberts and Bries</i>

945
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,429
<i>Springfield, we're going to die</i>

946
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:39,191
<i>Springfield, I'm scared, goodbye</i>

947
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:50,993
Assistant manager
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

948
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,036
Four years of film school for this?
