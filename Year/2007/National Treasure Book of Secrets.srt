1
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,643
He's in the other room.

2
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,248
- Are you Thomas Gates?
- Yes.

3
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,123
We got something
that we'd like you to take a look at.

4
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,486
I hear you're quite good
with puzzles and riddles.

5
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,363
- It's a coded message.
- It's a Playfair cipher.

6
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,366
- Playfair cipher?
- Can you decode it?

7
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,929
Cipher's impossible to decode
without the key.

8
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:52,171
- What do you mean by "a key"?
- A keyword or phrase.

9
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,612
I believe what you need is right there.

10
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,673
It'll take some time.

11
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,746
Go on. I'll take your diary.
I'll meet up with you later.

12
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,858
Whoa.

13
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,443
... calculate the distance
and you're sure to hit the mark

14
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,780
in about most things
as well as shootin'.

15
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,657
...ready to pour out all over you
like apple sass over roast pork.

16
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,966
I'll take care not to
give up my hold on poor De Boots

17
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,601
till I am quite sure of the American.

18
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,436
Ah, that's my own girl.

19
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,407
Augusta, dear, to your room.

20
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:04,848
... to turn you inside out, old
gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap.

21
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,525
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

22
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,707
Temples.

23
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,576
Gold.

24
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,117
CÃ­bola? This is a treasure map.

25
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,949
KGC? You're Knights of the
Golden Circle. You're a traitor.

26
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,051
You're all traitors.

27
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,831
- President Lincoln's been shot!
- Everybody, out! All of you!

28
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,835
Killer's on the loose!

29
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:03,332
I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish
deciphering that code now.

30
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,280
- Dad!
- The war is over.

31
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,647
No!

32
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,522
- No!
- No!

33
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,595
You're wrong about that.

34
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,301
The war has only just begun!

35
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,478
Charles.
The debt that all men... men pay.

36
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,344
The debt that all men p...

37
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,708
Dad! No, please!

38
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,054
Come back. It's not fair.

39
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,324
Help! Somebody help, please!

40
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,823
So recapping:

41
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,928
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,

42
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,133
operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.

43
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,770
Had Thomas not burned the legendary
missing pages from the Booth diary,

44
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,781
the killers may have found
a vast treasure of gold,

45
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,784
and the Union may well have
lost the Civil War.

46
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,218
Thank you.

47
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,455
I'd like
to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.

48
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,516
Thank you.

49
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:34,863
And say what a wonderful addition Thomas
Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.

50
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:35,923
Thank you.

51
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,401
Thank you, Dr. Nichols.
I only wish my grandfather

52
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,703
had been here to see this wonderful day.

53
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,300
Excuse me.
I have a question I'd like to ask.

54
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,176
What do you think happened
to that Booth diary page

55
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,148
- that was pulled out of the fire?
- We may never know.

56
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,650
Perhaps.

57
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,379
Perhaps not.

58
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,222
You see, I have one of those
great-great-granddaddies, like you,

59
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:04,092
way up in my family tree,
name of Silas Wilkinson.

60
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,088
He used to tell a story
about the night Lincoln was shot.

61
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,129
As Silas tells it,

62
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,435
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.

63
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,301
It was Thomas who called the meeting.

64
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,278
A meeting to plan
the assassination of Lincoln.

65
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,837
- How absurd.
- That's a lie!

66
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,084
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you...

67
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,280
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

68
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:37,057
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.

69
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,660
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.

70
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,933
<i>He shouted, "Sic semper tyrannis"
after he shot Lincoln.</i>

71
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,533
- "Thus always to..."
- "Thus always to tyrants." We know.

72
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,237
<i>- "Surratt, copiae"?
- Military supplies.</i>

73
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,646
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

74
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,617
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.

75
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:08,655
<i>- "Thomas Gates, artifex."
- "Designer"</i>

76
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:12,095
- or "mastermind."
- I know what it means.

77
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,429
He must have,
uh, planned the assassination.

78
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,494
- I see.
- Could mean mastermind of anything.

79
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,200
You see that?
Burned out right there.

80
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,878
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

81
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,744
- May I, Mr?
- Wilkinson.

82
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,512
I'll see if this new page
matches the Booth diary.

83
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,748
This is an outrage.
You're calling my grandfather a liar.

84
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,383
With respect, now you're calling
my great-great-granddaddy a liar.

85
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,656
Yes, sir, I am. This isn't
some garbage from a history book.

86
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,094
My grandfather
told me this story himself.

87
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,600
- I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

88
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,471
We'll test this thoroughly,
Patrick, to authenticate it.

89
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,517
It can't be.

90
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,718
Maps to presidents' houses.

91
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,290
Keys to locks that don't exist.

92
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,485
What's the point?
What am I looking for?

93
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,028
Proof, proof, proof.

94
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,866
What proof?

95
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,148
Oh, wow. Is this a book
about the Templar treasure?

96
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:52,755
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.

97
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:57,326
Conspiracy theories, urban legends
and other myths that are true.

98
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,861
- So the author's here signing copies?
- I'm the author.

99
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,335
- You are?
- Yeah. See, uh...

100
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,105
There's a picture of me right there.

101
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,905
I think it's a pretty good picture.

102
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,281
I thought that guy,
Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.

103
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:17,220
Well, yes, Ben did,
but I am the co-finder.

104
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,350
- Oh, I've never heard of you.
- Oh!

105
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,128
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?

106
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,030
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Do you own a red Ferrari?

107
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,268
- Yes, I do.
- Well, it's being towed.

108
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,538
Hm?

109
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,917
Wait! Wait! That's my car!

110
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,092
Where's the Ferrari?

111
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,494
- IRS impounded it.
- The IRS?

112
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,166
Funny story.
My accountant set up a corporation

113
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,436
on an island that didn't exist

114
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,536
and assured me
that that's how rich people do it.

115
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,244
Then I got audited and slapped
with a huge fine plus interest.

116
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,211
Wanna know what taxes
are on five million dollars?

117
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,587
Six million dollars.

118
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,453
But enough about me.

119
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,893
What's new with you?

120
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,832
Well, my girlfriend kicked me out,
I'm living with my dad,

121
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,029
- my family killed President Lincoln.
- All right.

122
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,940
I need your help.

123
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,234
I can't believe
you have to break into your own house.

124
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,008
I need to get Abigail's ID.
She has access to the Booth diary page.

125
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,208
Why don't you ask Abigail for her help?

126
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,684
She changed the alarm code, Riley.
She's not going to talk to me.

127
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,812
All right.

128
00:10:55,888 --> 00:11:00,348
We have 30 seconds after
the alert starts to disable the alarm.

129
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,827
Go.

130
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:12,627
I'll probably regret asking this, but
what happened with you and Abigail?

131
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,471
I don't know. I don't know.
She started using the word "so" a lot.

132
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,941
"So?"

133
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,070
Yeah, like,
"So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter."

134
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:25,049
"So, you seem to always know what's
best." "So, I guess I'm invisible."

135
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,881
Now I've moved out,
we're dividing furniture...

136
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,750
Oh.

137
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:34,350
Women. Can't live with them, especially
if they change the alarm codes.

138
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,455
You did that in 25 seconds.

139
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,020
That's why I tell people to get a dog.

140
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,596
- Got it.
- All right, let's go.

141
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,701
That's not Abigail's car.

142
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,748
She was on a date.

143
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,308
Isn't that that guy?
The White House guy?

144
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,116
The White House Easter Egg Roll
is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...

145
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,145
He's weird!

146
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,886
What happens if kids
don't find all the eggs?

147
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,690
Wow. You work in a museum,
and you live in one.

148
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,025
Pretty much.

149
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,623
What clever repartee.
She must like him.

150
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,726
All right, let me give you
a tour of the house.

151
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,328
- OK.
- That's actually kind of...

152
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,135
Oh, Abigail.

153
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,940
- What are you doing here?
- I just needed to get some things.

154
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,412
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.

155
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,706
How did you get in, Ben?

156
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,320
Riley! Come out here!

157
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,384
What?

158
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:47,595
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...

159
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,692
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance?

160
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,796
- No, I haven't read it yet.
- Mm.

161
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,867
I know you.
You're the White House curator.

162
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:01,504
- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

163
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,247
What?

164
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,909
Um, maybe I should go.

165
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,614
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

166
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,917
I... I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

167
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,254
You do?

168
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,191
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.

169
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,358
- Awkward.
- Oh, great.

170
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,562
- Good night.
- Good night.

171
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,837
I cannot believe you broke in.

172
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,501
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.

173
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,271
Hand it over, Ben.

174
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,905
I need to see
the Booth diary page.

175
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,781
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

176
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,652
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

177
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,021
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

178
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,287
It could have been erased or faded.

179
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,819
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.

180
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,889
Not up to me.
It's not my department.

181
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,492
That department reports
to your department.

182
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,867
Come on. One look under infrared.

183
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,896
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

184
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,043
Both of them?

185
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,151
We've been looking
at this page for hours.

186
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,813
There's nothing there.

187
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:22,093
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

188
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,595
In a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

189
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,962
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

190
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,197
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud"?

191
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,295
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

192
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:39,310
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

193
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,041
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

194
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,778
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

195
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,650
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

196
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:54,489
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And I
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

197
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,625
- Ben.
- What?

198
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,096
Look at this.

199
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,858
- See that?
- Oh.

200
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:08,703
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge."

201
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,906
It's nothing.

202
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,646
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

203
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,147
The letters are backwards.

204
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,209
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.

205
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,585
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

206
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:29,424
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

207
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:33,898
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

208
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,196
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.

209
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,566
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.

210
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,401
- All right.
- Uh, can I get a printout of this?

211
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,374
There's a billion words
in the English language.

212
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,503
Got to be a logical...
Let's start from the beginning.

213
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,137
A. Aardvark.

214
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,207
Don't want to rain on your parade here,
but I don't think this is gonna stop

215
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,244
Dr. Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

216
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:02,124
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?

217
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,156
What if he isn't innocent?

218
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,503
Sir? Looks like our old friend
Ben Gates is in the news again.

219
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,705
What did he find now? Atlantis?

220
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,476
A guy came forward
with a missing Booth diary page.

221
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,609
That's not the best part.
Listen to this.

222
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,778
"On the page are the names
of the conspirators

223
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,881
in the Lincoln assassination, as well
as a previously unknown conspirator,

224
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,587
Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said
to be the great-great-grandfather

225
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,256
of treasure hunter
Benjamin Franklin Gates."

226
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,233
- Thought my relatives were bad.
- What do we know about this Wilkinson?

227
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,500
- Sir?
- Guy claims he had this page

228
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,906
for 140 years then just suddenly
comes forward with it?

229
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,244
- Why?
- We'll find out.

230
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:55,814
Better.

231
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:56,610
Better.

232
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,780
Bacon.

233
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,649
- Keep going.
- That's stupid.

234
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,920
- How's he doing?
- Keep working.

235
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,530
<i>We're grateful
to the Wilkinson family</i>

236
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,297
<i>for coming forth with the page.</i>

237
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,239
<i>On the page is a name of a previously
unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.</i>

238
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,835
- Nichols has bought into it. See?
- Would you stop watching that.

239
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,345
It's on the Internet!

240
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,619
<i>- No stopping it now.
- Gates may have been the architect...</i>

241
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,284
- They have no understanding.
- You know the truth.

242
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,656
That's all that matters.
You heard the story from Grandpa.

243
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:46,096
The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.

244
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,996
We have a story. We have nothing.

245
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,594
For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.

246
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,730
- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

247
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,034
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates

248
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:02,705
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. history.

249
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,342
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

250
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,518
You and I both know he burned the page

251
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,078
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.

252
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,953
That's what we're going to prove.

253
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,516
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.

254
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,961
You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.

255
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,727
Let's hear the story again
from Grandpa Charles.

256
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,362
Grandpa heard his father say,
"Treasure map."

257
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,499
- Then there was a commotion.
- Got all that. Anything after that?

258
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:34,137
Anything he said,
something he did? Anything at all?

259
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,038
- Wait a minute.
- What?

260
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,313
He took his son's hand.

261
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:46,483
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,

262
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,427
- "The debt that all men pay."
- "The debt that all men pay"?

263
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,624
The debt that Thomas paid.

264
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,031
That's five letters.

265
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,625
Oh!

266
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,862
Try "Death."

267
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,667
- What?
- It's the keycode.

268
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,570
The debt that all men pay is death.

269
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,370
All right.

270
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,282
L-A-B-O-U-L...

271
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,920
It's Lab-ool...

272
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:20,186
Lab-ahl... La...

273
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,419
It's gibberish.

274
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,723
- Laboulaye!
- Laboulaye!

275
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,423
- What is that?
- It's a who. Ãdouard Laboulaye.

276
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,522
Where's the phone?

277
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,295
I don't know.
Can't find anything in this mess.

278
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:34,362
- Temporary till I find a new place.
- Find the old one. I like her.

279
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,638
- Hi.
- Dr. Chase.

280
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,871
- Abigail, please.
- Abigail.

281
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,244
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

282
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,879
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

283
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,754
Of course. I was actually going
to call you about the diary page.

284
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,054
- Any news?
- Well...

285
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:59,461
We actually found some
latent letter fragments on it.

286
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,091
Take a look.

287
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,669
Random letters. A cipher?

288
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,365
- Maybe.
- Gates seen this?

289
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,499
He's the one that discovered it.

290
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,111
- I'm sorry.
- Not a problem.

291
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,210
- I need one minute.
- Please, take your time.

292
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,478
Hey. What?

293
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,020
We cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye."

294
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,817
<i>The cipher spells "Laboulaye."</i>

295
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,917
So? Laboulaye was well-known
in France. It could be nothing.

296
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,691
Or maybe there was a treasure map
like Thomas Gates said there was,

297
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,995
and Laboulaye had it.
We only got a partial on the next word.

298
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,229
L-A-D, lad... ladder...

299
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,964
- L-A-D.
- Aladdin! Aladdin?

300
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,438
- Lady!
- Thank you, Abigail!

301
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,542
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know
what Laboulaye was planning

302
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,240
<i>right around the time
Lincoln was assassinated?</i>

303
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,441
OK, Ben, I've got to go.

304
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,984
There's a map or a clue to a map
on the Statue...

305
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,482
- She hung up.
- She took your call. That was good.

306
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,251
- Dr. Gates?
- Yes.

307
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:05,496
Sounds like he cracked the cipher.
I couldn't help but overhear.

308
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,624
Laboulaye? As in Ãdouard Laboulaye?

309
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,294
He seems to believe so, yes.

310
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,770
Man who had the idea
for the Statue of Liberty.

311
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,070
You're saying there's a treasure map
in the Statue of Liberty?

312
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:21,044
Laboulaye was a Mason.
They built clues into everything.

313
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,978
Did you learn that from my book?

314
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,646
- Have an interest in history?
- Fascinated by it.

315
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,189
Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from

316
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,556
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

317
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,825
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

318
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:45,063
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

319
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,300
So the only question is,
which Statue of Liberty?

320
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,465
Exactly.

321
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,840
Is there more than one?

322
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,469
There are three, actually, Riley.

323
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:59,984
One is in New York,
one in the Luxembourg Garden.

324
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,553
But he only referred to one
as his "lady."

325
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,884
But he only referred to one
as his "lady."

326
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,435
This is like, impossible,
what you're doing.

327
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,134
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

328
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:28,236
Laboulaye had to leave a clue
somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.

329
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,146
Let me get there.
It's not as easy as it looks.

330
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,616
No. Believe me, I understand.

331
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,381
Excuse me, officer. May I help you?

332
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,725
Ah, American, eh?

333
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,351
Of course you see no problem

334
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,660
in disturbing everyone's
pleasant morning

335
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,099
- with your buzzing there.
- Hey!

336
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:54,468
You know how much our constitution was
influenced by your man, Montesquieu?

337
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,268
- You know Montesquieu?
- Got it.

338
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,874
Montesquieu, yeah. "A government
should be set up so that..."

339
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,041
"...no man need
be afraid of another."

340
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,346
- That's very good.
- Thank you.

341
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,178
- I'm astonished.
- I got it, I got it.

342
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,321
- I hope you read French.
- May I?

343
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,627
He's a cop.

344
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:23,464
Um..."Across the sea
these twins stand determined..."

345
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,003
- Resolute.
- "Resolute," yeah.

346
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,972
"...to preserve what we are looking for.

347
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,942
- Uh... Laboulaye, 1876."
- Six.

348
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,538
- It's a clue.
- "These twins stand resolute."

349
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,544
Let's see. Resolute twins.

350
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,552
Resolute.

351
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,154
Resolute. And then twins.

352
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:51,862
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes
between France and Thailand?

353
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,499
<i>That's ridiculous.
HMS Resolute.</i>

354
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,895
A British ship that got lost
in the Arctic in the 1800s.

355
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:05,943
It was salvaged by American whalers, and
then Congress sent it back to England.

356
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,468
When the ship was finally retired,

357
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:13,507
Queen Victoria had two desks
made from its timbers.

358
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,985
VoilÃ . Resolute twins.

359
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:20,388
- And where are those desks now?
- The closest one is in London.

360
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,757
How fast can we get
to Buckingham Palace?

361
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,388
Don't know. Why don't you ask
your new best friend?

362
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,490
He's going to call you a cab.

363
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,092
OK?

364
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,832
- Nice helicopter. Is that yours?
- Yes, actually. It is.

365
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:39,002
- OK, so you get the ticket.
- Great.

366
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:43,073
Mitch Wilkinson studied history
at Virginia Military Institute.

367
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,016
Graduated 1978. Ran a private security
company which had contracts in Iraq

368
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,883
during the invasion,
and in the Congo in the late '90s.

369
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:54,221
These are trained mercenaries as well as
being black-market antiquities dealers.

370
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,823
So why does a black market
antiquities dealer...

371
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,160
...give up a rare Civil War artifact?

372
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:06,466
Something he could sell to a private
collector for a good deal of money?

373
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,869
So the queen's office is here.

374
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,030
The elevator shaft gets you close,

375
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,939
but the only direct access
is through security.

376
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,467
- That should be exciting.
- We got to get you in that room.

377
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,547
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- Ben.</i>

378
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,176
It's Patrick Gates' phone.
He's calling Ben.

379
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,310
Give me that.

380
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,054
The house was broken into
last night. I was attacked.

381
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,647
Call the police. I'm coming home.

382
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,556
- What?
- What good would that do?

383
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,721
<i>They didn't take anything.
And besides, I'm fine.</i>

384
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:42,255
OK. We're in London.
We're going to Buckingham Palace.

385
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,497
<i>We have an appointment
with the curator tomorrow afternoon.</i>

386
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,800
<i>- Son, just be careful. Goodbye.
- Bye.</i>

387
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,737
Someone else is after the treasure.

388
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,208
Of course someone else
is after the treasure.

389
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,145
- It's the axiom of treasure hunting.
- We have to hurry and see that desk.

390
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,409
We don't want to miss that appointment.

391
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,679
- Hi. Ben Gates.
- See security. They'll let you in.

392
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:20,827
Wow.

393
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,657
OK. It's teatime, chaps.

394
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,740
Looking for the curator's office.
Which way was it again?

395
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,283
Follow the stairs round,
then turn first left.

396
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,978
Thank you so much.

397
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,155
- Ben.
- Abigail.

398
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,456
- What's she doing here?
- What're you doing?

399
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,623
Your dad called me.
Said your next clue was here.

400
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,633
<i>- She's really there?
- Ben...</i>

401
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,168
<i>- Drop her. Lose her.
- I want to help.</i>

402
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,999
That's very nice,
but it's a bad time right now.

403
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,769
- A bad time, right now?
- It's a bad time.

404
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:35,472
OK, I just flew all the way
to London to offer my help...

405
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,947
<i>- Remember the plan.
- You don't need it?</i>

406
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,778
You're the one making a scene.

407
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:43,287
- I... I'm not making a scene right now.
- We want to make a scene.

408
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,983
Well then, fine! If that's what
you want, let's have it out now!

409
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:51,258
<i>- So subtle.
- Let me guess? It's the wrong time.</i>

410
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,196
It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again!

411
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,200
Wrong about us,
wrong about Thomas Gates,

412
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,862
wrong that you'd like
the Queen Anne chair!

413
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,962
You're wrong to assume
I'd like the chair.

414
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:05,908
You see? Everybody, listen to this.
This is more interesting than that.

415
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:09,469
She thinks that even when I'm right,
I'm wrong! Isn't that right?

416
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,415
Abigail, just because
I answer a question quickly

417
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,850
doesn't make it wrong.

418
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,616
Not if the answer's something
we need to figure out as a couple.

419
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,385
- That's what couples do!
- Sir.

420
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,449
You and your missis, take it outside.

421
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:26,588
Now look what you've done. You've
brought the little bobbies down on us!

422
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,633
You take the missis outside.
I'm staying right here.

423
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,235
- Ben!
- Whee!

424
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,032
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Hello.

425
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,573
- Been drinking, have we?
- Just a nip.

426
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,667
Popped down to the pub for a pint!
Bit of all right!

427
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,712
Going to arrest a man for that?

428
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,216
Going to detain a blighter
for enjoying his whiskey?

429
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,875
- Enough.
- Bangers and mash.

430
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,578
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.

431
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:49,677
- Sir!
- Haggis!

432
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:53,622
- That's it! Dismount the banister!
- I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!

433
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,784
Here they are, standing in a row!

434
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,920
Small ones, big ones,
some as big as your head!

435
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,488
That was brilliant.

436
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,934
- What's wrong with being right?
- Nothing. You should try it sometime.

437
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:09,064
- You're saying that I'm never right?
- I did not say that.

438
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,267
Hoo! So I'm wrong again.

439
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,443
- Now, see, there you are correct.
- Capital. Topper.

440
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:18,744
Your mother told me about you.

441
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:24,279
- In here, please.
- Why don't you just make a list

442
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,518
of what's OK for me
to say or not write something...

443
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,491
- What's right or wrong...
- You two, stay.

444
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,530
- Right?
- No! No, no, man.

445
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,862
- Don't leave me in here!
- That's great. Wow.

446
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,900
What is going on?

447
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,905
I'm sorry for getting you roped
into this, but you were excellent.

448
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,067
- Thank you. So were you.
- When did you figure out

449
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,873
- it was a fake argument?
- When'd you figure out I was

450
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,608
- arguing during the fake argument?
- The middle.

451
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,617
Where "I assume I'm right."
Get us out. Which I don't get.

452
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,620
If I'm right, after I assume I'm right,
then I'm correct.

453
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,122
When you get to a conclusion
without asking,

454
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:02,216
and you happen to be right,
you got lucky.

455
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,319
I get lucky a lot.

456
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,924
So where does that leave me, Ben?

457
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,229
You guys are so great together.

458
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,201
- Want to know why I'm here?
- Uh-huh.

459
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,640
Think there may be a clue on
the Resolute desk in the queen's study.

460
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:20,876
Does that help?

461
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:25,405
Don't understand why it's difficult for
you to include others in your decisions.

462
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:29,010
Just because you may know
what my answer is going to be

463
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,647
doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.

464
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,124
<i>Door number one, opening.</i>

465
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,288
OK. Let me try this out.

466
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,459
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?

467
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,297
Yes. Thank you.

468
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,997
Ridiculous. You're staying.

469
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,005
- It's too dangerous.
- I am so coming.

470
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,633
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.

471
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,642
- You're not coming.
- Call security.

472
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,238
<i>You should be near
a service elevator.</i>

473
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,544
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?

474
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,612
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

475
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,214
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.

476
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,892
- No.
- Don't let her go.

477
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,394
Abigail...

478
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,488
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!

479
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,429
Hold this.

480
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,906
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

481
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,035
Yeah.

482
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,814
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.

483
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,678
So?

484
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,519
So I think it smells kind of pretty.

485
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,523
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

486
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,267
Let's go.

487
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,900
<i>OK, now turn left.</i>

488
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,505
<i>- Dead end.
- I mean right. Go right.</i>

489
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,918
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.

490
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,260
Go, go.

491
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,631
That's it.

492
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,230
The Resolute desk.

493
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,704
We're looking for...

494
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:35,609
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

495
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,482
Hey, look at this.

496
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:48,687
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."
- Hold on one second.

497
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,920
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

498
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,092
<i>He made Chinese puzzle boxes.</i>

499
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,533
- Oh...
- What?

500
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:12,207
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

501
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,810
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

502
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:17,846
What about a year?

503
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:22,655
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1819.

504
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,558
So you go one...

505
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:28,487
Eight.

506
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,562
One.

507
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,767
Nine.

508
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:45,309
- Any luck?
- OK... 1876 was on the inscription

509
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,715
<i>on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.</i>

510
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,241
One.

511
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,817
Eight.

512
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,122
Seven.

513
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,230
Six.

514
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,950
Uh-oh.

515
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,756
New rules.

516
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,896
These markings, like Incan or Aztec.

517
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,198
I have never seen any symbols like this.

518
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:44,640
I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

519
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,108
What do you think it means?

520
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,704
I doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

521
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,510
Uh-oh.

522
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,882
<i>Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there.</i>

523
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:05,758
- Oi! Where are my detainees?
- OK, let's make some noise.

524
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,767
The fire alarm's gone off.

525
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,895
Uh-oh. God save the queen.

526
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,873
<i>All units, go to action zebra.</i>

527
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,034
- What's going on?
- Haven't the foggiest.

528
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,207
Someone or something is causing this.

529
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,548
- Check your primary stations.
- This doesn't make any sense.

530
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,884
Find the source terminal
and check public areas four and eight.

531
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,868
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. Keep moving.

532
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,572
Keep walking until you're
on the other side of the fountain.

533
00:36:55,646 --> 00:37:00,982
- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
- I got them. They're at the main gate.

534
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,966
- Oi! Sparkle. Come on.
- OK. Here we go.

535
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,597
I'm a little bit allergic.

536
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,835
- Riley.
- Thank you. OK.

537
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,243
- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Sit! Sorry!

538
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,876
Thanks for waiting for me.
Can I see the thing?

539
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,784
Daniel, hold it.

540
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,620
What is that?

541
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,386
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all I got was this wood?

542
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,122
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.

543
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,425
It's an incredible discovery.

544
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,501
- Wilkinson.
- Stop them. Go, go, go!

545
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,066
- He's the one after the treasure.
- I'll drive.

546
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,837
We're in England.

547
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,217
It's a gun! Get down!

548
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,787
- We're trapped!
- Hang on! Keep your heads down.

549
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,331
Hey, who are you?

550
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,448
Sorry.

551
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,690
- Hey!
- Oi!

552
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,166
- Ben, they're getting closer.
- What is their problem?

553
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,441
Whoa!

554
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,070
- Go left! Go left!
- Hold on.

555
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,450
Turn, turn!

556
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,445
Watch out!

557
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,189
Everybody OK?

558
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,530
- Come on, come on.
- Danny, I want them stopped.

559
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,270
Look out!

560
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,035
Ah!

561
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:52,782
Ah!

562
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,310
Go. Go, go, go, go!

563
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,473
Did you see where he went?

564
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,220
- What is that? Someone's phone.
- It's him.

565
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:31,523
- Have his number in your speed dial?
- Oh, shu...

566
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,790
This has to end
before someone gets hurt.

567
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,890
Give me what you got at Buckingham,
it won't be necessary.

568
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,264
Tell that to my father.

569
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,064
Moron!

570
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,632
Why are they standing
in the middle of the street?

571
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,881
- Where are these people going?
- Why's everyone running?

572
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,621
- He's right there! Go!
- Move!

573
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,091
Get out of the way!

574
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,462
- Did I just run over a man's foot?
- Watch the people!

575
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,733
Go! Go! Faster!

576
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,219
- Right over there.
- I got them.

577
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,355
- They're still behind us.
- This phone have a camera?

578
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,919
- No. No, it's broken.
- All right. Give me the plank.

579
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,126
Hang on.
We're going to run a red light.

580
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,364
Ah! Ah!

581
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,806
Hack into the London Police database
and get a picture from that traffic cam.

582
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,546
- Okey-dokey.
- You can't do it?

583
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,454
No, I can. I just don't like
that you assume that I can.

584
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,084
Why, thank you, Riley.

585
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,308
Get it!

586
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,681
Stop! Stop!

587
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,574
- He's got it.
- What is it?

588
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:01,145
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

589
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,045
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

590
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,284
- Abigail!
- Hey, Patrick.

591
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,450
Nice to see you two together again.

592
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,723
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.

593
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:23,255
Oh, I was hoping to get some
of these boxes out of the house.

594
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:36,437
I can't read the whole thing,
but I can tell you that

595
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,005
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

596
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:43,485
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.

597
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:50,257
I can identify one symbol.

598
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,388
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?

599
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,432
Sacred calendrical? I don't know.

600
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,459
That symbol is CÃ­bola.

601
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,395
That's CÃ­bola.

602
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,805
The City of Gold.

603
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:05,670
The City of Gold.

604
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,673
"In 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

605
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,615
There were only four survivors.

606
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:19,679
One was a slave named EstebÃ¡n
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

607
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,590
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

608
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,560
a city built from solid gold.

609
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,591
Later, when EstebÃ¡n tried to find
the city again, he never could.

610
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:36,300
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

611
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,200
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

612
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:45,715
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it."

613
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:56,088
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

614
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,294
My God.

615
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,821
I'm going to go talk to her.

616
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,102
- You're coming with me.
- No!

617
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:11,437
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.

618
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,873
There are several others.

619
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:15,275
For ancient Native American?
No one better.

620
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:18,337
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

621
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,612
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

622
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,515
That long?

623
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:28,952
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

624
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,722
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

625
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,230
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.

626
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,700
- Who?
- His mom.

627
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,802
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

628
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:49,642
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognize me.

629
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:51,880
I hate her!

630
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,408
We're in the right place.

631
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,718
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

632
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,623
- Hi, Mom.
- Benjamin!

633
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,857
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

634
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,919
Hi.

635
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,155
Oh.

636
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:15,361
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

637
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,304
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.

638
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,241
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

639
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,302
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

640
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,349
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

641
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:30,546
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

642
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,715
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

643
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,988
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

644
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,427
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into

645
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:43,557
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

646
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,727
You thought it had secret stitching.

647
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,237
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

648
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,672
- Six phony green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

649
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,968
I need you to take a look at this.

650
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,672
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.

651
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:02,274
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.

652
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,079
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

653
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,319
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

654
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,652
Yes, of course you were.

655
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,831
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

656
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,699
Mom, this is actually very important.

657
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,107
All right. What have we got here?

658
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:30,542
This... this glyph here,
that means "bird." And that means...

659
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,612
Uh, "noble bird."

660
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,885
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand

661
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,223
and give you passage
to the sacred temple."

662
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,097
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for CÃ­bola, don't you?

663
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,503
Well, that is exactly what it is.

664
00:47:56,573 --> 00:48:00,703
No, this glyph doesn't mean "CÃ­bola."
It means "the center of the world."

665
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,679
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

666
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,446
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

667
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,315
- Mom...
- I was trying to get course credit.

668
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,914
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

669
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,152
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

670
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,524
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

671
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:23,498
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

672
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:27,797
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

673
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:32,703
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

674
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,106
I'm sorry.

675
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,380
Not that I'm surprised.

676
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,940
At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

677
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,917
What?

678
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,753
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

679
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,485
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

680
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,064
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

681
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,623
So where is it?

682
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:02,330
Inscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute."

683
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,899
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

684
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:09,503
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

685
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,479
President's desk?

686
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,878
The president. What president?

687
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,886
- Our president?
- Unfortunately, yes.

688
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,478
But that means...

689
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,886
Wait, so we have to...

690
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,351
The White House?

691
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:27,221
The Oval Office... to be exact.

692
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,630
Why would I overreact to that?

693
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:40,140
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

694
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,268
Thank you.

695
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,208
It's early, pre-Columbian.

696
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,550
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

697
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,920
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

698
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,790
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

699
00:49:57,861 --> 00:49:59,260
Where are we to find them?

700
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:03,330
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

701
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,389
What do you mean?

702
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:08,696
These glyphs here... they're cut off.

703
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,942
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

704
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,877
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

705
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:19,615
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

706
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,878
Look at this. Look.

707
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,817
Small door on the front of the desk.

708
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:27,345
FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

709
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,325
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.

710
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:33,595
This could work.

711
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:37,394
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

712
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:39,929
I think you're right.

713
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:46,467
<i>We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.</i>

714
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:50,639
<i>Face painting continues at 2:00
near the south fountain.</i>

715
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:55,676
- That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

716
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,880
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.

717
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,616
Yeah, I love it.

718
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,357
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

719
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,796
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

720
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:11,026
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

721
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:14,537
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

722
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,970
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with

723
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,009
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

724
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,205
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

725
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,681
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

726
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,277
when attending the theater. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

727
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:33,322
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

728
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,553
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

729
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:39,595
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

730
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,791
What is going on
with the education in America?

731
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,836
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!

732
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,371
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

733
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,999
...with Gates.
- Connor.

734
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,134
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.

735
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,707
Aren't you going to ask him?

736
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,273
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

737
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:04,479
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.

738
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:09,687
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.

739
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:12,887
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

740
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,831
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...

741
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,030
- I can do that.
- Really?

742
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,092
You see?

743
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,069
- You can?
- Yeah.

744
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,440
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

745
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,172
Connor rocks.

746
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,872
Well... here we are.

747
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,315
- Mm.
- Wow.

748
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:40,018
Empire furnishings
and crenelated molding. Love it.

749
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,921
Hm.

750
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,893
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

751
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,953
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

752
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:49,157
Oh. Sorry.

753
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:55,430
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.

754
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,166
Might recognize it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

755
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,836
playing underneath
while his father was working.

756
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,778
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

757
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,748
But many people don't know

758
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:10,274
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

759
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,378
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?

760
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,719
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

761
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,726
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

762
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,261
And Ford, of course.

763
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,830
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.

764
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,923
- No.
- Yes.

765
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,730
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

766
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,437
Oh! I... I did, yes.

767
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,772
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

768
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:37,643
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

769
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,649
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.

770
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,082
- Yes.
- Excellent point,

771
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,450
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

772
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:47,752
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here

773
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,155
and check it out?

774
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,861
I'll check over here.

775
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,398
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

776
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:14,450
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

777
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,186
Oh, no.

778
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:33,366
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

779
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,403
Connor!

780
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:44,641
- You found it.
- I did.

781
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,548
Thank you so much!

782
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,460
Uh...

783
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,094
You're just the best. Mm.

784
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,228
Mm!

785
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,140
Mm!

786
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,206
Mm!

787
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,044
Thank you.

788
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:25,455
OK.

789
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:26,285
OK.

790
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,122
- Empty.
- Someone must've taken it.

791
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,789
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

792
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,991
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

793
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:40,559
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The presidential seal.

794
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,537
It's not the presidential seal.

795
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:46,268
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

796
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,244
- I'm not sure what this is.
- What do we do?

797
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,904
Did none of you read my book?

798
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:55,080
The eagle clutching the scroll.

799
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,249
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

800
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,447
But it's not something I could tell you.

801
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:04,459
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.

802
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:14,464
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.

803
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,095
Chapter 13.

804
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:25,176
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book."

805
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:29,412
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

806
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:32,887
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

807
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:36,690
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

808
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,197
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

809
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,994
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

810
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:50,028
And the coup de grÃ¢ce... Area 51.

811
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:53,234
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.

812
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:56,244
Is it, Abigail? Is it?

813
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,474
It's just totally...

814
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,809
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

815
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:04,650
Hm. 'Cause last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

816
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,884
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.

817
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:10,516
Same symbol.

818
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,994
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of Information Act.

819
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,792
The eagle and the scroll,

820
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:20,131
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

821
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:23,001
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

822
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:25,973
is now in the President's Secret Book?

823
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,677
Ben.

824
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,439
If it was you trying to convince me...

825
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:36,944
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.

826
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,387
The eagle with the scroll?

827
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,162
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

828
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:51,098
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

829
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,759
You bought Riley's book.

830
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:56,237
Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

831
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,774
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

832
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,275
Does the president have a secret book?

833
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,446
Do you like ducks?

834
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,116
There is a book.

835
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,455
Why are you telling me out here?

836
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:21,096
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

837
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,428
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.

838
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,903
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

839
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,565
The book is passed
from president to president,

840
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,904
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

841
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,001
You're the FBI.
Can't you get it for me?

842
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:38,639
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

843
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,081
Well, you never know.

844
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,182
All I need is a few minutes with him.

845
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,852
A few minutes? Really?

846
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,154
Even if you were married
to the president,

847
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,490
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

848
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,554
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...

849
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,930
How do you expect
to get the president alone?

850
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,128
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

851
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,963
People used to say,
"The United States are."

852
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:10,343
<u>Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States is."</u>

853
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:16,743
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

854
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,980
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

855
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,546
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

856
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:23,954
With his life.

857
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:29,421
So how am I gonna get him alone?

858
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:34,398
I'm gonna kidnap him.

859
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:39,031
I'm gonna kidnap
the president of the United States.

860
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,805
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.

861
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:48,112
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.

862
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,175
Are you out of your mind?

863
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,313
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

864
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,789
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

865
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:58,828
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

866
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:00,022
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

867
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,291
- What?
- I'm in.

868
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,229
Sir, we have to move the party.

869
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:08,201
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel

870
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,762
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.

871
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,298
<i>- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the Washington Gazette.</i>

872
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:18,473
They want a quote on, "Is the president
being insensitive to minority issues?"

873
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:21,676
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

874
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,413
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.

875
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:28,184
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

876
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:33,285
- I... There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.

877
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:36,127
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.

878
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,463
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

879
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:41,901
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

880
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:46,135
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

881
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:49,406
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

882
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,674
Book it before someone else does.

883
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,980
And let me say
what an honor it is to be here

884
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:01,386
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr. President.

885
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,713
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

886
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,452
Are you aware that you are
in a restricted area?

887
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,051
Yeah, but this is
where the fish are, son.

888
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:42,564
That may be, but I'm gonna
need to have you move upriver.

889
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,770
Are you aware that according
to article one, section 25

890
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,435
of the Maryland constitution,
I'm allowed to fish in public water?

891
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:59,379
Are you aware I have the right to detain
you for the next 48 hours without cause?

892
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:04,520
I am going to go back where
I came from just as fast as possible.

893
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:15,625
Maybe one day I'll wear this thing
to a party I was actually invited to.

894
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,309
Twenty hundred time check. Station 11.

895
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,937
<i>- All clear. Perimeter secure.
- Hey.</i>

896
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:34,346
You didn't happen to see
a cute brunette wandering around?

897
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,511
- Went to get a drink, she disappeared.
- No, sir.

898
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,744
I've got no game tonight.

899
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:50,658
Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello.

900
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:54,760
Prime Minister, it's a delight
to have you back in the States.

901
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:58,967
Spread the word, contribution limits
not enforced on the president's birth...

902
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,633
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

903
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:04,407
- Ben Gates. The Templar treasure?
- Oh, right, Ben Gates. Yeah.

904
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,745
- We won't keep you.
- Thanks so much. Always a pleasure.

905
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:12,151
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
for me to be invited here tonight, sir.

906
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:16,089
Yeah, you must have
the Secret Service hopping about now.

907
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,490
Sir?

908
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,619
Considering your discovered lineage.

909
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:22,220
- Oh, yeah. Oh, that...
- Carry on.

910
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,495
I beg your pardon, sir,
but I know what a huge admirer you are

911
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:29,561
of George Washington. I thought
you might want to take a look at this.

912
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,197
Have a look at that.

913
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,869
This is a map of Mount Vernon
drawn by George Washington himself.

914
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:37,811
Mr. President,
that is exactly what it is.

915
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,646
- Architectural history major, Yale.
- I did not know that.

916
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,514
It belonged to my great uncle.

917
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,713
Got it from the granddaughter
of a slave, Charlotte.

918
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:49,087
- Happy birthday.
- Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.

919
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,719
Charlotte, who lived here
and worked here at Mount Vernon.

920
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:56,162
- Yeah.
- And we're standing right here, sir.

921
01:03:56,232 --> 01:04:00,498
This line is an underground tunnel,
an escape route that was never found.

922
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:04,232
I wonder...
I wonder if it's still there.

923
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,402
Well...

924
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:11,173
- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.

925
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,472
Are we allowed to do that?

926
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,251
I mean, I know you're allowed
to do that. You're the president.

927
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,582
Can I come with you?

928
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,885
- You guys are just everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

929
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,484
- Give my friend your flashlight.
- Thank you.

930
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,360
According to this map, it should be...

931
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:34,426
It's one... two. In here.

932
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,130
Yeah, should be in here.

933
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:39,169
- May I?
- Absolutely.

934
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,732
All right.

935
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:47,549
You know, Craig,
I appreciate you doing your job,

936
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,608
but I have no enemies down here.

937
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:53,445
In the cellar. In this tiny little room.

938
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:56,224
I'll just wait here, then.

939
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:08,693
Over here.

940
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:15,976
- That's the mark of George Washington.
- Only it's slightly different.

941
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:19,606
- How?
- These axes, the angle's off.

942
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:26,385
For it to correspond with the ones on
the map, it should form a perfect V.

943
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,789
OK, what else?

944
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,630
The arrowhead...

945
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:40,898
...is sideways.

946
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,703
We're all right.
Don't worry.

947
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,415
Look at that.

948
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,209
Come on.

949
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,450
Mr. President?

950
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,590
We have a breach
in zone nine! There's...

951
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:17,002
- Inform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One!
- Perimeter detail, lock down all exits!

952
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:20,642
- Gates, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.

953
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:24,441
I need to ask you a question,
which I know you can't answer

954
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,311
- unless we're alone.
- Two coming in!

955
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:31,576
I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar,
I want a jackhammer, now!

956
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,113
Tom, alert the vice president.

957
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,919
Mr. President, sometime between 1880,

958
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,089
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office,

959
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:46,658
and now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.

960
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:50,502
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.

961
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:55,340
A treasure map to CÃ­bola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.

962
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,743
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?

963
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,214
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.

964
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:05,516
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.

965
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,112
You've been in my desk too?

966
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:10,249
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...

967
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:13,118
...in the President's Book, sir.

968
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:18,124
The book known only to our presidents.

969
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,726
It contains all of our nation's secrets.

970
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,272
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

971
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:35,215
I saw the seal in the desk, sir.
I know the map exists.

972
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:39,277
You're not going to tell me
how to get out of here

973
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:42,722
- unless you get what you want.
- The way out is that direction,

974
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,623
and I'll show you.

975
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,752
You don't negotiate very well, do you?

976
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,025
No, sir.

977
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:50,825
Mr. President!

978
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,595
Where are my sledgehammers?

979
01:07:58,474 --> 01:07:59,736
I don't get you, Gates.

980
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,639
You do all this,
you're willing to go to prison,

981
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,009
just to clear your ancestor's name.

982
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:08,148
The way out is just down those stairs.

983
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:12,320
Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.

984
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,886
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion

985
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,552
to his country to stop the KGC.

986
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:22,427
When someone dies for their country,
I believe they should be honored.

987
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,363
"Last full measure of devotion"?

988
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:27,901
Lincoln is my favorite president, sir.
No offense.

989
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:32,471
None taken. He's my favorite too.

990
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,473
Sir, I know the book exists,
and my question is,

991
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:40,913
"Will you agree to let me see it?"

992
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,246
Even if something like that
really did exist,

993
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,221
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?

994
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,688
Because it will probably lead us

995
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:53,854
to the discovery of the greatest
Native American treasure of all time.

996
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:57,489
A huge piece of culture lost.

997
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,660
You can give that history
back to its descendants.

998
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:04,901
And because you're the president
of the United States, sir.

999
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:09,843
Whether by innate character, or the oath
you took to defend the Constitution,

1000
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,813
or the weight of history
that falls upon you.

1001
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,417
I believe you
to be an honorable man, sir.

1002
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:20,820
People don't believe that stuff anymore.

1003
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,349
They want to believe it.

1004
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:51,384
Nearest highway is that direction.
You'll understand if we part ways here.

1005
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,758
- Gates.
- Sir?

1006
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:01,887
The following conversation
never happened.

1007
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:04,732
The book exists.

1008
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,335
- Where is it?
- Where else do you keep a book?

1009
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,235
In the Library of Congress.

1010
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:15,672
X, Y, two, three, four,
seven, eight, six.

1011
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,035
Thank you, sir.

1012
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:22,916
You'll also need to know
three, seven, nine, four.

1013
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:24,282
Got it.

1014
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:28,983
- And, Gates...
- Sir?

1015
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:34,360
Two hundred people know you held me
against my will. I can't tell them why.

1016
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,762
Unless you find what you're looking for,

1017
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,630
you'll be charged
with kidnapping the president.

1018
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:44,071
- You know what that means.
- Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.

1019
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:51,606
- I want you to do something for me.
- It would be a privilege, sir.

1020
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:56,508
Page 47. Just have a look at that.

1021
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,952
Riley, meet me at the
Library of Congress in 20 minutes.

1022
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:06,650
OK.

1023
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:14,925
Sadusky.

1024
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,475
The president's been what?

1025
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:20,442
The president's been what?

1026
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:23,834
Gates.

1027
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,442
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1028
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,923
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1029
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:37,618
- Hey.
- Hey.

1030
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,392
We're close.

1031
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:52,963
- Where do we start?
- XY is the book classification code.

1032
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:56,534
Stands for special collections,
which means very special books.

1033
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:59,581
- Where are they?
- This way. We'll sneak in.

1034
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:23,527
This will be good.

1035
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,966
Here we go. XA... XM...

1036
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,418
Look. Do you have a code?

1037
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,552
Three-seven-nine-four.

1038
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,594
What did the president say
the number was?

1039
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,860
Two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1040
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:01,967
Two-three-six-seven...

1041
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:05,104
X-Y-two-three-three,
two-three-seven-eight... Here.

1042
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,841
Two-three-four-seven-nine-one.

1043
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,815
- Two-three-four-seven-nine...
- Seventy-six, 78...

1044
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,182
It's not there.

1045
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,784
Maybe someone checked it out.

1046
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:21,590
- Why send us here if there's no book?
- He probably wanted us to get caught.

1047
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,396
Here.

1048
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,824
- What is that?
- It's a six-dial combination lock.

1049
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:55,796
The location is the combination.

1050
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:58,929
The location is the combination.

1051
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,052
Yes. I was right.

1052
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,353
Well done, Mr. Poole.

1053
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,121
Eagle and the scroll.

1054
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,434
- Area 51!
- Shh!

1055
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:49,073
- Kennedy assassination.
- Shh! We don't have time.

1056
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,176
Yeah, it's true.

1057
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,851
Here. Wait.

1058
01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:01,089
"April 1865. Queen Victoria
sends Pike two coded missives.

1059
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:05,633
The first is received.
Contains information regarding

1060
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:09,103
New World treasure. The City of Gold."

1061
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:13,072
Wait. The queen
wanted to help the Confederacy?

1062
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:16,770
- A divided America'd have been weaker.
- Needed cotton from the South.

1063
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:20,008
"The second missive was thought
to contain a Playfair cipher

1064
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:24,018
suggesting contact with Laboulaye,
who'll hide clues before his death."

1065
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:27,817
The cipher written into the Booth
diary page that Thomas tried to burn.

1066
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,188
- The one we have.
- Exactly. "1880.

1067
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:35,157
Resolute desk arrives in Washington,
sent by queen to President Hayes."

1068
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,188
Look at that.

1069
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:43,233
Missing plank from the White House. Wow.

1070
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,767
Here's the final entry
by President Coolidge.

1071
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:51,904
"1924. I found a plank
in secret desk compartment.

1072
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:55,677
Plank photographed and then destroyed.

1073
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:58,549
Borglum commissioned
to destroy landmarks

1074
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,747
in sacred Black Hills mountains."

1075
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:06,987
Borglum. Mount Rushmore?

1076
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:12,657
He carved Mount Rushmore
to erase the map's landmarks

1077
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,202
in order to protect the City of Gold.

1078
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,866
Mount Rushmore was a cover-up.

1079
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:21,705
What is it?

1080
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:26,679
There's my tax dollars at work,
coming to arrest me.

1081
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,376
Not coming for you,
they're for me. Go to the car.

1082
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,351
- No!
- Go! I'll meet up with you.

1083
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,909
This way.

1084
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:44,163
So Gates abducts the president,
lets him go

1085
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,223
and heads to the Library of Congress?

1086
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,929
- Why?
- Maybe he wants to check out a book.

1087
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,915
This way.

1088
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,280
<i>All agents...</i>

1089
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,825
- Dad.
- Ben.

1090
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:50,160
Get out of there.
I had to move the car.

1091
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,632
FBI, Secret Service all over the place.

1092
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:55,465
Calm down. I sent a picture
of the plank to your cell.

1093
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:57,471
- You can do that?
- Yes, I can do that.

1094
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,199
<i>Did you get it?</i>

1095
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,339
<i>- I got it.
- Look.</i>

1096
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:07,106
<i>- Take it to Mom for translation.
- Why me?</i>

1097
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,241
He say his mom
could translate the plank?

1098
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,217
Find out who she is.

1099
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:25,161
- How are we going to find Ben?
- I don't know.

1100
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,133
- Hold it! Who are you?
- We work here.

1101
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,397
- IDs.
- Here. We were told to evacuate.

1102
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:31,166
I don't know what's going on.

1103
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:33,833
- My car's parked...
- One second I'm reading...

1104
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:37,401
- Special section for...
...a book, then we're rushed out...

1105
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,037
- Go ahead.
- OK. Thank you.

1106
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:42,208
- Thank you for your help, officer.
- Best of luck.

1107
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,516
Have a good night.

1108
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:52,355
Hey, go
to the northeast sectors...

1109
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,162
Start the car.

1110
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:01,395
Put it in gear.

1111
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,339
- Uh-oh.
- What's the problem?

1112
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,533
It's clear. Let's go!

1113
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,439
We're going to jail.

1114
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:13,309
I want to run a check...

1115
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:17,515
Get in! Hang on!

1116
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:20,349
Mercedes SUV...

1117
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,982
- He's in! Go!
- Hang on!

1118
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:24,685
Whoa!

1119
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,053
OK. We can do this.

1120
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,393
Close the barricade, lock it down!

1121
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,561
<i>Lock it down!</i>

1122
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,104
- Drive, drive, drive!
- OK.

1123
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,938
I don't think so!

1124
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:45,874
Whoa, whoa!

1125
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:52,650
Go, go, go, go, go!

1126
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:54,985
Let's go! Let's go!

1127
01:19:57,559 --> 01:20:00,050
That did not turn out
the way it was supposed to!

1128
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:02,790
- How'd they find us so quick?
- I'll tell you how.

1129
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,527
- The president is a tattletale!
- Sadusky. He was there.

1130
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,933
He knows more about the book
than I thought.

1131
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,105
How'd the president
feel about being kidnapped?

1132
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,697
How'd the president
feel about being kidnapped?

1133
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:13,366
He was OK.

1134
01:20:19,783 --> 01:20:22,718
- Dr. Appleton.
- This office is closed. I'm sorry.

1135
01:20:22,786 --> 01:20:25,254
I do apologize
for the lateness of the hour.

1136
01:20:26,623 --> 01:20:28,818
My name is Mitch Wilkinson.

1137
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:32,521
I've got something I want you
to take a look at. Just take a minute.

1138
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:42,601
- You're a treasure hunter.
- No, ma'am.

1139
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:45,436
I'm just a man trying
to make his mark on history.

1140
01:20:45,976 --> 01:20:47,307
Can you help me?

1141
01:20:48,712 --> 01:20:52,978
Um... No, I don't know that language.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1142
01:20:53,083 --> 01:20:55,608
Oh, excuse me.

1143
01:20:58,755 --> 01:20:59,847
Yes.

1144
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:02,925
Got it.

1145
01:21:03,527 --> 01:21:07,293
Your ex-husband's on his way up.
He wants the translation.

1146
01:21:08,732 --> 01:21:13,897
Tell him anything but the truth.
Get rid of him. His life depends on it.

1147
01:21:23,547 --> 01:21:25,105
Emily?

1148
01:21:37,828 --> 01:21:40,058
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

1149
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:45,397
and I'm not comfortable either,
but we need you to translate something.

1150
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:51,402
- Ben sent me. He needs your help.
- Yes, of course.

1151
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:54,700
If it's for Ben, of course. What is it?

1152
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:58,111
Oh. Uh...

1153
01:21:58,181 --> 01:22:00,945
It's in the cell phone.
I'm not sure how to...

1154
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:03,008
- Give it to me.
...bring it out.

1155
01:22:10,894 --> 01:22:13,294
We know it leads to Mount Rushmore.

1156
01:22:17,367 --> 01:22:20,564
Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass."

1157
01:22:20,637 --> 01:22:25,267
That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.

1158
01:22:25,976 --> 01:22:26,965
Right.

1159
01:22:30,247 --> 01:22:34,650
"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird."

1160
01:22:39,222 --> 01:22:40,280
That's it?

1161
01:22:47,898 --> 01:22:52,232
Did it ever occur to you?
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1162
01:22:53,436 --> 01:22:57,372
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?

1163
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:04,011
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,

1164
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,413
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.

1165
01:23:07,484 --> 01:23:09,475
Certainly wasn't going to be you.

1166
01:23:10,353 --> 01:23:14,813
Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?

1167
01:23:17,427 --> 01:23:18,985
No, of course not.

1168
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:21,293
So just go away.

1169
01:23:35,378 --> 01:23:36,868
Lousy tequila.

1170
01:23:41,451 --> 01:23:43,681
Don't feel bad. You did good.

1171
01:23:43,753 --> 01:23:45,812
Patrick believed every word you said.

1172
01:23:45,889 --> 01:23:49,450
Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.

1173
01:23:49,526 --> 01:23:51,357
You don't know Benjamin.

1174
01:23:51,428 --> 01:23:54,989
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.

1175
01:23:58,635 --> 01:24:03,504
A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?

1176
01:24:03,573 --> 01:24:07,839
Seems the dear old queen
was partial to the Confederate cause.

1177
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:11,480
This has been handed down
by my family for 140 years.

1178
01:24:12,315 --> 01:24:16,615
Contains a vital piece of information.
The final clue, as it were.

1179
01:24:16,686 --> 01:24:22,556
This piece of information is worthless
without your translation of the planks.

1180
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,823
It's ironic, isn't it?

1181
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:30,662
This all began with the burning
of pages, and now it ends

1182
01:24:30,734 --> 01:24:34,261
with the burning of this,
the final clue.

1183
01:24:35,105 --> 01:24:36,834
Making me the only one...

1184
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:38,742
...who can find CÃ­bola.

1185
01:24:38,742 --> 01:24:39,538
...who can find CÃ­bola.

1186
01:24:41,811 --> 01:24:42,869
Get your coat.

1187
01:24:55,759 --> 01:24:58,751
Her translation on the second half
of the planks says

1188
01:24:58,828 --> 01:25:02,389
- we need to find an island of stone.
- Ben would have found it by now.

1189
01:25:02,799 --> 01:25:04,061
I don't think so.

1190
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:13,706
How do I get to, um, this...

1191
01:25:15,578 --> 01:25:16,806
Hello, Mitch.

1192
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:19,539
Mom...

1193
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:22,483
- Wait for me.
- No way. You're too slow.

1194
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:25,811
I knew you'd figure out
the message I gave your father.

1195
01:25:26,222 --> 01:25:29,191
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

1196
01:25:29,259 --> 01:25:32,990
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.

1197
01:25:33,063 --> 01:25:37,329
I kidnapped the president. The FBI
is on their way right now to arrest me,

1198
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,425
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

1199
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:41,629
They'll find us both and arrest us both.

1200
01:25:41,705 --> 01:25:44,435
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?

1201
01:25:44,674 --> 01:25:47,575
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.

1202
01:25:47,644 --> 01:25:50,010
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.

1203
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,947
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.

1204
01:25:56,019 --> 01:25:57,486
I'm afraid he's burned it.

1205
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:05,489
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?

1206
01:26:06,129 --> 01:26:09,462
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,

1207
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:12,763
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.

1208
01:26:12,836 --> 01:26:14,736
- What?
- I'm going with you.

1209
01:26:14,804 --> 01:26:18,570
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,

1210
01:26:18,641 --> 01:26:19,903
it's going to be me.

1211
01:26:19,976 --> 01:26:23,070
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.

1212
01:26:23,146 --> 01:26:24,807
What makes you think I'd agree?

1213
01:26:25,715 --> 01:26:30,243
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.

1214
01:26:34,824 --> 01:26:37,054
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

1215
01:26:39,963 --> 01:26:43,831
But believe me... I don't need the guns.

1216
01:26:48,772 --> 01:26:52,572
- Which president? The president?
- I thought it best not to tell you.

1217
01:27:05,889 --> 01:27:09,552
I still don't see anything
that looks like a noble bird.

1218
01:27:11,494 --> 01:27:13,462
All right. Let's have it.

1219
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:17,967
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?

1220
01:27:18,034 --> 01:27:23,336
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain."

1221
01:27:23,406 --> 01:27:24,998
Figure that one out.

1222
01:27:25,074 --> 01:27:28,703
So we come back when it's raining?

1223
01:27:30,713 --> 01:27:34,547
"Cloudless." Could simply mean the sun.

1224
01:27:35,218 --> 01:27:38,210
You need a sunny day... and rain.

1225
01:27:39,589 --> 01:27:40,578
We need water.

1226
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:42,484
Water.

1227
01:27:53,136 --> 01:27:54,262
Abigail.

1228
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:58,874
Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.

1229
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:00,170
Em? Water?

1230
01:28:00,243 --> 01:28:04,339
- What's this in my hand? Are you blind?
- Good, good, good.

1231
01:28:16,392 --> 01:28:19,623
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?

1232
01:28:29,272 --> 01:28:30,739
That's it.

1233
01:28:30,807 --> 01:28:35,403
Oh! That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!

1234
01:28:37,614 --> 01:28:38,740
Look at this!

1235
01:28:40,283 --> 01:28:41,341
It's an eagle.

1236
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:45,947
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.

1237
01:28:46,389 --> 01:28:49,187
- "The noble bird..."
- "Will give you passage."

1238
01:28:49,259 --> 01:28:52,751
- Uh-huh. Now what?
- We need to join hands,

1239
01:28:52,862 --> 01:28:57,731
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.

1240
01:28:58,868 --> 01:29:02,395
- It indicates direction...
- Somehow that bird...

1241
01:29:02,472 --> 01:29:06,306
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...

1242
01:29:06,376 --> 01:29:10,608
You can stand around guessing for a
while, or I can give you the next clue.

1243
01:29:11,881 --> 01:29:14,782
"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior."

1244
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:18,651
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.

1245
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,255
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.

1246
01:29:26,329 --> 01:29:29,025
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!

1247
01:29:29,098 --> 01:29:30,656
It's a horrible trap.

1248
01:29:30,733 --> 01:29:34,362
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?

1249
01:29:35,705 --> 01:29:37,070
I'll do it, Ben.

1250
01:29:37,707 --> 01:29:38,696
It's OK.

1251
01:29:43,246 --> 01:29:45,111
Surrender your hand.

1252
01:30:02,131 --> 01:30:05,225
- I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist.
- You!

1253
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:10,928
It, uh... feels like a latch.

1254
01:30:20,283 --> 01:30:21,477
Look at this.

1255
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:36,159
All right, good. Let's go.

1256
01:30:56,552 --> 01:30:58,144
Oh!

1257
01:31:02,492 --> 01:31:03,959
Ben, look at this.

1258
01:31:04,861 --> 01:31:07,022
Oh, that's beautiful!

1259
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,860
- Patrick. Patrick!
- Ben, what is that?

1260
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:16,928
Appears to be a counterweight
to hold the door open.

1261
01:31:17,006 --> 01:31:19,099
What is that sound?

1262
01:31:19,175 --> 01:31:20,506
Fascinating.

1263
01:31:24,147 --> 01:31:26,342
Ah!

1264
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:27,474
Ben!

1265
01:31:37,927 --> 01:31:39,224
Sorry.

1266
01:31:39,295 --> 01:31:40,887
- You OK?
- No.

1267
01:31:41,364 --> 01:31:42,353
Get up.

1268
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,189
It's locked.

1269
01:31:45,268 --> 01:31:50,035
- Patrick, what have you done?
- Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.

1270
01:31:50,106 --> 01:31:52,074
Only one way out of here now.

1271
01:31:54,143 --> 01:31:55,371
Forward.

1272
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:03,052
Oh!

1273
01:32:07,924 --> 01:32:10,358
Never seen so many relics.

1274
01:32:10,426 --> 01:32:12,519
So beautifully preserved.

1275
01:32:15,865 --> 01:32:18,527
Looks like we're going
to be moving some rocks.

1276
01:32:18,601 --> 01:32:22,037
- There's a tunnel back in through here.
- Guys, look at this.

1277
01:32:25,074 --> 01:32:26,598
It's a little golden man.

1278
01:32:29,212 --> 01:32:34,047
Look. It's got a tiny little torso.
Look at that. It looks like...

1279
01:32:47,196 --> 01:32:48,993
- Ben!
- Ben!

1280
01:32:54,737 --> 01:32:58,002
Move back! Move back!
All of you! Other side!

1281
01:33:00,943 --> 01:33:02,069
Back up! Back up!

1282
01:33:02,912 --> 01:33:04,072
Ah!

1283
01:33:08,451 --> 01:33:10,419
Riley, move forward! Move forward!

1284
01:33:11,554 --> 01:33:13,021
No, back up, back up.

1285
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:17,250
- What you want me to do?
- Stop! Stop!

1286
01:33:20,963 --> 01:33:24,660
We have to balance our weight
to even this thing out.

1287
01:33:27,837 --> 01:33:29,896
- We'll find 'em.
- What are we gonna do?

1288
01:33:29,972 --> 01:33:32,702
Figure something out.
Tell you what we're going to do.

1289
01:33:32,775 --> 01:33:35,141
- No, I'll tell you.
- No. I'll tell you!

1290
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:38,044
No, I'll tell you!
There's that passageway.

1291
01:33:38,114 --> 01:33:42,380
You go, pull those stones out,
because that leads somewhere.

1292
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:44,578
That is a good idea.

1293
01:33:48,124 --> 01:33:51,252
There's nothing.
Just a big old black hole.

1294
01:33:55,164 --> 01:33:57,632
Ben, look!
There's a ladder.

1295
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:01,761
- I mean, what's left of a ladder.
- Toss me the light.

1296
01:34:04,273 --> 01:34:08,175
Riley. Move slowly to that corner.
No! Wait. Just...

1297
01:34:08,244 --> 01:34:11,372
- As I move to this corner.
- OK.

1298
01:34:13,549 --> 01:34:15,016
One step at a time. Good.

1299
01:34:19,388 --> 01:34:22,516
If we can raise this corner,
I think I'll reach it.

1300
01:34:26,095 --> 01:34:28,325
- Stop! Red light!
- You're not helping!

1301
01:34:28,397 --> 01:34:30,456
I can get up there just as easy as you.

1302
01:34:32,702 --> 01:34:33,691
Just stop.

1303
01:34:35,171 --> 01:34:37,332
- Guys!
- It's three against one here.

1304
01:34:37,406 --> 01:34:41,069
I ain't going last, and if I'm not
going last, I might as well go first.

1305
01:34:42,445 --> 01:34:43,434
Look!

1306
01:34:46,315 --> 01:34:47,907
What's it gonna be?

1307
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,123
We'll do this your way.

1308
01:35:13,175 --> 01:35:17,043
The rest of us, on my count of three,
all move together.

1309
01:35:17,113 --> 01:35:18,603
One step at a time.

1310
01:35:19,448 --> 01:35:22,474
One, two, three.

1311
01:35:41,804 --> 01:35:43,431
- You ready?
- Go.

1312
01:35:55,051 --> 01:35:56,040
Ah!

1313
01:36:17,306 --> 01:36:19,297
Mitch, what do you see?

1314
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:22,167
Is there a way out?

1315
01:36:23,779 --> 01:36:25,303
What's up there, Mitch?

1316
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:38,319
Em?

1317
01:36:38,394 --> 01:36:43,832
- Are you all right?
- Just promise me he's gonna be OK.

1318
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:49,563
All right.

1319
01:36:51,374 --> 01:36:52,500
Let's go.

1320
01:36:53,509 --> 01:36:55,977
Mitch! Come on!

1321
01:36:56,746 --> 01:36:59,442
- I've been doing the math here, and...
- I know.

1322
01:36:59,882 --> 01:37:02,316
We're gonna have to leave
one person behind.

1323
01:37:02,385 --> 01:37:04,512
Promise you'll
come back for me.

1324
01:37:04,587 --> 01:37:06,316
I can do the math too.

1325
01:37:07,723 --> 01:37:10,385
- That makes you next.
- I'll go last.

1326
01:37:12,094 --> 01:37:16,588
"No, we'll figure something else out."
"We need you there. Please, Riley."

1327
01:37:18,334 --> 01:37:19,494
I'm just kidding. Go.

1328
01:37:20,002 --> 01:37:21,560
OK...

1329
01:37:50,499 --> 01:37:55,163
- One... two... three!
- Go!

1330
01:38:00,309 --> 01:38:01,674
Oh!

1331
01:38:02,311 --> 01:38:04,404
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1332
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,038
Uh!

1333
01:38:09,985 --> 01:38:11,009
I can't get it.

1334
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,051
Just go! Go now! Go!

1335
01:38:22,565 --> 01:38:24,430
- All right, ready?
- Now!

1336
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,695
Ah!

1337
01:38:26,769 --> 01:38:28,532
Riley! Hang on!

1338
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:36,068
OK. Mitch, the idol.
OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here!

1339
01:38:36,145 --> 01:38:38,841
We can roll it over
to offset your weight!

1340
01:38:38,914 --> 01:38:40,279
Then roll it!

1341
01:38:43,586 --> 01:38:44,575
Here it comes!

1342
01:38:53,429 --> 01:38:54,828
Come on, Ben!

1343
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,429
Here! Give me your hand!

1344
01:39:01,837 --> 01:39:03,327
Ben!

1345
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:05,598
Thanks, Riley.

1346
01:39:08,878 --> 01:39:10,743
Why couldn't a girl see me do that?

1347
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:18,550
- You all right?
- You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.

1348
01:39:20,856 --> 01:39:23,051
So... forward.

1349
01:39:26,595 --> 01:39:29,758
What is this?

1350
01:39:29,832 --> 01:39:32,630
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1351
01:39:34,203 --> 01:39:35,431
Oh!

1352
01:39:40,176 --> 01:39:42,007
Put your light over there.

1353
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,447
What are you doing?

1354
01:40:12,508 --> 01:40:14,976
I can't see anything!
Is this it?

1355
01:40:20,482 --> 01:40:21,471
It's oil!

1356
01:41:00,589 --> 01:41:03,990
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!

1357
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,127
We have to turn back!

1358
01:41:15,738 --> 01:41:17,069
OK.

1359
01:41:19,675 --> 01:41:22,667
No. No, Patrick, this is crazy.

1360
01:41:25,547 --> 01:41:26,536
OK.

1361
01:41:31,687 --> 01:41:32,915
I got it!

1362
01:41:35,124 --> 01:41:37,684
I got you! I got you!

1363
01:42:06,588 --> 01:42:08,146
There's no forward!

1364
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,355
It's not forward, it's down!

1365
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:18,858
All this water has to go out somewhere.
Otherwise, it'd be filled up.

1366
01:42:29,244 --> 01:42:31,235
Help me turn this wheel!

1367
01:43:04,513 --> 01:43:06,378
The water's going down.

1368
01:43:56,498 --> 01:43:58,193
It is... Em.

1369
01:43:59,301 --> 01:44:01,292
Em. Em.

1370
01:44:07,509 --> 01:44:09,340
Ben! Hey!

1371
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:13,711
Dad! We found it!

1372
01:44:14,082 --> 01:44:17,643
- Thomas was right!
- No, you were right!

1373
01:44:23,025 --> 01:44:26,290
Sorry I smeared your
great-great granddaddy's good name.

1374
01:44:26,361 --> 01:44:28,921
Seemed like the only way
to get you in on the hunt.

1375
01:44:28,997 --> 01:44:33,764
But this was a chance for the Wilkinson
family to make its mark on history,

1376
01:44:33,836 --> 01:44:37,772
to find the City of Gold,
to be remembered.

1377
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:11,903
What happened to you?
Your father was worried sick about you.

1378
01:45:11,974 --> 01:45:14,340
She was frantic. She was frantic.

1379
01:45:15,344 --> 01:45:18,745
Dad, coming through,
did you happen to see?

1380
01:45:18,814 --> 01:45:22,750
Stop it. Coming through, did you see
any branches that could lead out?

1381
01:45:22,818 --> 01:45:26,811
No, it's all blocked. You can't even
get back to the big, round stone door.

1382
01:45:27,322 --> 01:45:28,846
Where's your mother going?

1383
01:45:31,593 --> 01:45:34,790
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
Have a look at this.

1384
01:45:34,863 --> 01:45:35,955
- What?
- Look.

1385
01:45:36,031 --> 01:45:38,431
This is gonna unlock
the Olmec language.

1386
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:42,129
It's gonna give us incredible
insight into pre-Columbian history.

1387
01:45:42,204 --> 01:45:44,035
Oh!

1388
01:45:44,106 --> 01:45:45,869
Em?

1389
01:45:45,941 --> 01:45:48,535
- You happy?
- Oh, yeah.

1390
01:45:49,511 --> 01:45:52,503
- Ben! Look at this! Look!
- Oh, yeah.

1391
01:45:53,048 --> 01:45:55,881
That's where they slit the throat,
cut the heart out.

1392
01:46:13,302 --> 01:46:16,294
- What was that?
- Listen.

1393
01:46:36,325 --> 01:46:38,088
Ah!

1394
01:46:42,431 --> 01:46:46,094
I tried to find a way out.
All those portals are blocked off!

1395
01:46:46,168 --> 01:46:49,626
I'm telling you, all this water
goes out somewhere. We'll find it.

1396
01:46:57,145 --> 01:46:59,045
Ben, there's a current!

1397
01:46:59,481 --> 01:47:02,541
Follow it!
There's got to be a central drain!

1398
01:47:02,618 --> 01:47:04,711
It's under us. Right here!

1399
01:47:13,962 --> 01:47:14,951
Come on!

1400
01:47:16,398 --> 01:47:18,389
Let's go! Get in there!

1401
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,533
The water's rising too fast!

1402
01:47:27,609 --> 01:47:30,339
Let's get that door open
so we don't all drown!

1403
01:47:47,062 --> 01:47:50,225
Ben, it slopes down!
It's a drainage tunnel.

1404
01:47:50,799 --> 01:47:53,063
It fills with water
when you open the door!

1405
01:47:53,168 --> 01:47:56,296
We need to find something
to stick under it to keep it open!

1406
01:47:56,338 --> 01:47:59,364
No, if it's open,
this tunnel will stay flooded.

1407
01:47:59,441 --> 01:48:02,137
We've got to get to the other side
and close the door.

1408
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:03,939
Patrick, Emily, go!

1409
01:48:09,317 --> 01:48:10,375
- No.
- No!

1410
01:48:11,953 --> 01:48:12,942
No!

1411
01:48:13,021 --> 01:48:15,785
Mitch, we got to be
on the other side of that door!

1412
01:48:16,324 --> 01:48:18,121
Nobody leaves unless I say so.

1413
01:48:19,594 --> 01:48:22,188
That door is not gonna stay open
by itself.

1414
01:48:22,264 --> 01:48:24,494
We both know what has to happen here.

1415
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,401
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.

1416
01:48:30,372 --> 01:48:31,464
I vote Mitch.

1417
01:48:32,541 --> 01:48:34,475
This isn't a democracy.

1418
01:48:39,114 --> 01:48:43,073
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!

1419
01:48:44,019 --> 01:48:46,510
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!

1420
01:48:46,588 --> 01:48:49,318
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.

1421
01:48:49,391 --> 01:48:53,657
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,

1422
01:48:53,762 --> 01:48:56,162
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!

1423
01:48:56,198 --> 01:49:00,100
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!

1424
01:49:02,003 --> 01:49:05,495
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.

1425
01:49:09,544 --> 01:49:12,172
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

1426
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:15,138
Abigail.

1427
01:49:19,254 --> 01:49:22,985
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.

1428
01:49:32,334 --> 01:49:33,596
- No!
- Let's go!

1429
01:49:34,102 --> 01:49:38,061
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.

1430
01:49:38,807 --> 01:49:40,434
Please, come on.

1431
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,604
Push, Ben!

1432
01:49:47,282 --> 01:49:49,216
The current's too strong!

1433
01:49:52,454 --> 01:49:54,649
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!

1434
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:11,628
Ah!

1435
01:50:17,712 --> 01:50:18,872
Mom!

1436
01:50:19,447 --> 01:50:21,677
Hang on!

1437
01:50:24,519 --> 01:50:25,781
Hold your breath!

1438
01:50:35,564 --> 01:50:37,395
Ah!

1439
01:50:37,465 --> 01:50:39,194
We got to get Ben out of there!

1440
01:50:42,237 --> 01:50:46,537
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,

1441
01:50:46,608 --> 01:50:49,543
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!

1442
01:50:49,611 --> 01:50:53,741
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!

1443
01:50:53,849 --> 01:50:56,374
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!

1444
01:50:56,418 --> 01:50:57,783
I'll get you out!

1445
01:50:57,853 --> 01:51:02,222
I found the City of Gold! I found it!

1446
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:04,281
And no one will ever know?

1447
01:51:04,359 --> 01:51:08,591
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!

1448
01:51:08,663 --> 01:51:12,224
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!

1449
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:15,463
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!

1450
01:51:16,304 --> 01:51:19,762
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!

1451
01:51:21,276 --> 01:51:23,403
Mitch!

1452
01:51:32,554 --> 01:51:33,612
Ah!

1453
01:52:03,885 --> 01:52:05,011
Thank you.

1454
01:52:22,537 --> 01:52:26,496
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
- Oh, hi.

1455
01:52:32,747 --> 01:52:35,307
Sir! It's for you.

1456
01:52:36,618 --> 01:52:37,607
Sadusky.

1457
01:52:38,553 --> 01:52:41,351
- I have my proof.
- Ben!

1458
01:52:41,756 --> 01:52:45,624
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?

1459
01:52:45,694 --> 01:52:49,357
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.

1460
01:52:49,431 --> 01:52:52,229
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.

1461
01:53:12,721 --> 01:53:15,315
Stop. Stop it.

1462
01:53:16,424 --> 01:53:18,756
- Mr. President?
- Craig, give us a minute.

1463
01:53:18,827 --> 01:53:22,593
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.

1464
01:53:22,664 --> 01:53:25,428
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,

1465
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:29,061
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.

1466
01:53:29,404 --> 01:53:30,598
Yes, sir.

1467
01:53:32,807 --> 01:53:34,570
- Gates.
- Sir.

1468
01:53:35,643 --> 01:53:40,205
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,

1469
01:53:40,281 --> 01:53:43,808
you have brought honor
to your country and your family.

1470
01:53:45,353 --> 01:53:48,288
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.

1471
01:53:48,823 --> 01:53:51,485
- Thank you.
- Craig.

1472
01:53:52,827 --> 01:53:57,093
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

1473
01:53:58,666 --> 01:53:59,655
Tomorrow?

1474
01:54:07,876 --> 01:54:09,138
Thank you, sir.

1475
01:54:10,111 --> 01:54:12,579
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates

1476
01:54:12,647 --> 01:54:14,740
will get credit for this discovery.

1477
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:24,256
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

1478
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:28,994
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.

1479
01:54:30,598 --> 01:54:33,590
Ben, I am curious
about that favor I asked you.

1480
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:37,570
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?

1481
01:54:37,639 --> 01:54:39,834
I believe I can help with that, sir.

1482
01:54:39,908 --> 01:54:43,105
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.

1483
01:54:46,781 --> 01:54:50,410
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?

1484
01:54:53,655 --> 01:54:54,781
What book?

1485
01:54:56,357 --> 01:55:00,418
Be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?

1486
01:55:00,495 --> 01:55:02,759
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?

1487
01:55:02,831 --> 01:55:04,196
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?

1488
01:55:04,265 --> 01:55:07,325
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?

1489
01:55:07,402 --> 01:55:10,701
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.

1490
01:55:14,676 --> 01:55:16,109
Excuse me.

1491
01:55:16,177 --> 01:55:20,079
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?

1492
01:55:20,148 --> 01:55:23,982
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.

1493
01:55:24,052 --> 01:55:28,489
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognize you from your book.

1494
01:55:29,157 --> 01:55:31,148
Will you sign it?

1495
01:55:31,226 --> 01:55:32,215
OK.

1496
01:55:41,469 --> 01:55:42,458
Thank you.

1497
01:55:43,805 --> 01:55:47,036
So, um, the tea tables...

1498
01:55:48,042 --> 01:55:51,773
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.

1499
01:55:52,747 --> 01:55:54,681
I was going to say
you can keep them.

1500
01:55:55,550 --> 01:55:59,680
And maybe you could...

1501
01:55:59,754 --> 01:56:02,052
...come and move back in with me.

1502
01:56:03,224 --> 01:56:06,022
- No. You used the word "so."
- So?

1503
01:56:06,094 --> 01:56:08,528
So, when you say "so,"
it means you're angry.

1504
01:56:08,596 --> 01:56:12,555
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.

1505
01:56:12,634 --> 01:56:14,966
It's sort of like a puzzle.

1506
01:56:16,504 --> 01:56:20,167
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1507
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:23,904
So...

1508
01:57:10,692 --> 01:57:12,319
I love this car.

1509
01:58:19,557 --> 01:58:20,557
