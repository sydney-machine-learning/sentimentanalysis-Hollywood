1
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,978
England

2
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,975
-I finished my play.
-Well done.

3
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,101
Have you seen Mummy?

4
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,020
Well, she'll be in the drawing room, I expect.

5
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,440
I hope you're not gonna be getting under
our feet today, Miss Briony.

6
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:31,026
We got a dinner for 10 to prepare.

7
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,875
-Hello, pal, I hear you're putting on a play.
-Who told you?

8
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,377
Jungle drums.

9
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,674
-Will you come and see it?
-I'm not sure that would be quite...

10
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,925
Why don't you let me read it?

11
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,427
You used to make me those beautiful
bound copies of all your stories.

12
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,805
-I've kept them all.
-I still want you to come.

13
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,850
-Let's see.
-I have to go now.

14
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,606
Mummy, I need you!

15
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,949
Stupendous. It's stupendous, darling.
Your first play.

16
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,701
Do you think so?
Do you think Leon will like it?

17
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,078
Well, of course he will.

18
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,873
The Trials of Arabella, by Briony Tallis.

19
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,260
Cee.
-Yes?

20
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,055
What do you think it would feel like
to be someone else?

21
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,308
Cooler, I should hope.

22
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,060
-I'm worried about the play.
-I'm sure it's a masterpiece.

23
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,063
But we only have the afternoon to rehearse.
What if the twins can't act?

24
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,816
You have to be nice to them.
I wonder how'd you feel if your mother

25
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,820
had run off with Mr What's-his-name
who reads the news on the wireless?

26
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,324
Perhaps I should have written Leon a story.

27
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,702
If you write a story, you only have to
say the word "castle," and you could see

28
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,622
the towers and the woods
and the village below, but...

29
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,625
In a play, it's...

30
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,878
It all depends on other people.

31
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,172
-Cee.
-Yes?

32
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,134
Why don't you talk to Robbie any more?

33
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,513
I do.
We just move in different circles, that's all.

34
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:38,111
-Do we have to do a play?
-Why do we have to?

35
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,114
-It's to celebrate my brother Leon's visit.
I hate plays.

36
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,534
So do l.
-How can you hate plays?

37
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,787
-It's just showing off.
-You'll be in this play or you'll get a clout.

38
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,915
-And I'll tell the parents.
You're not allowed to clout us.

39
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,710
We're guests in this house. And what did
the parents say we were to make ourselves?

40
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,504
-Well, Pierrot?
-Amenable.

41
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,464
-Jackson?
-Amenable.

42
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,258
Amenable, that's right.

43
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,720
Now, Briony, what's your play about?

44
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,766
Well, it's about how

45
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,103
love is all very well,
but you have to be sensible.

46
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,230
-I suppose you're going to be Arabella.
-Well, not necessarily.

47
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,816
-In that case, do you mind if I play her?
Lola was in the school play.

48
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,112
Do say yes. It'd be the first decent thing
to happen to me in months.

49
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,865
Well, yes, all right.

50
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,159
I suppose we should start by reading it.

51
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,329
If you're going to be Arabella, then I'll be
the director, thank you very much.

52
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,581
Sorry.

53
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,669
I'm going to do the prologue.

54
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,423
"Prologue.

55
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,260
"This is the tale of spontaneous Arabella,

56
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,096
"who ran away with an extrinsic fellow.

57
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,765
"It grieved her parents to see their firstborn

58
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,851
"evanesce from her home
to go to Eastbourne."

59
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,103
Yes?

60
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,651
-Nothing. Just thought I'd watch.
Rehearsals are private, I'm afraid.

61
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,862
You can see the play this evening.

62
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,199
-I'll have to work then.
-Well, I'm sorry, Danny.

63
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,160
Can we go for a swim now?
Yes, yes, yes!

64
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:12,414
-No, I don't really think there's time!
Cecilia will let us.

65
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,501
I'm sure a half-hour break
would do us all good.

66
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,794
Cecilia? Cecilia!

67
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,672
Cecilia!

68
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:32,221
Cecilia! Cecilia, Cecilia.
Please, can we go for a swim, Cecilia?

69
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,724
Yes, I don't see why not.
Don't go out of your depth!

70
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,386
Can you do me
one of your Bolshevik roll-ups?

71
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,645
Beautiful day.
-I suppose so. Too hot for me.

72
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,608
-Are you enjoying your book?
-No, not really.

73
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,775
It gets better.

74
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,445
I prefer Fielding any day.

75
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,950
Much more passionate.

76
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,425
-Leon's coming down today, did you know?
-I heard a rumour.

77
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,470
He's bringing a friend with him.
It's Paul Marshall, the chocolate millionaire.

78
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,181
-Are the flowers for him?
-Why shouldn't they be?

79
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,475
Leon says he's very charming.

80
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,480
The Old Man telephoned last night.
He says you're planning on being a doctor.

81
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,774
-I'm thinking about it, yes.
-Another six years of student life.

82
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,984
-How else do you become a doctor?
-You could get a fellowship, now,

83
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,653
-couldn't you? With your First?
-I don't want to teach.

84
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,241
I said I'd pay your father back.

85
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,163
That's not what I meant at all.

86
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,340
-Let me help with that.
-No, I'm all right, thanks.

87
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,676
-Take the flowers. Take the flowers.
-I'm all right. I'm all right.

88
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,558
Oh, you idiot.

89
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,395
Do you realise that's probably
the most valuable thing we own?

90
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,438
Not any more, it isn't.

91
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,483
Careful!

92
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,730
I'm...

93
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,189
Hello, Robbie!

94
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,613
No need to encourage him.

95
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,042
Cee?

96
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,047
Mother?

97
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,969
-Where is everyone, Danny?
-I don't know, sir.

98
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,472
Sir.
Gasping for a drink.

99
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,352
-Will you have one?
Rather.

100
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,979
-Whisky?
-Please.

101
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,319
-Leon!
-Here she is.

102
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:07,282
Oh, I've missed you.
I've been going completely doolally up here.

103
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,911
-This is my sister, Cecilia. Paul Marshall.
-I've heard an awful lot about you.

104
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,247
-Likewise.
Where are we putting him?

105
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,667
In the blue room. Mother's lying down,
she's got one of her migraines.

106
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,169
I'm not surprised, with this heat.

107
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,174
It's the big room next to the nursery.

108
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,014
Is the Old Man staying in town?

109
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,767
Looks like it.
Some sort of rush on at the Ministry.

110
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,787
So aren't we doing the play?
No.

111
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,790
Why not?
-Don't ask me.

112
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,544
I don't like it here.

113
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,755
There's always a problem
when a new brand comes about.

114
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,757
The remarketing, the re-packaging,
the re-shaping.

115
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,969
Even the re-flavouring in some cases,
or whole new technology.

116
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,472
I think our main challenge is whether or not
to launch the new Amo Bar.

117
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:16,268
The Army Amo. Do you see? Pass the Amo?

118
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,146
My source at the Ministry is very reliable,

119
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,648
I used to clean his shoes at Harrow,
informs me we have a good chance

120
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,692
of including it
in the standard issue ration pack.

121
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,653
Which means that I'd have to open
at least three more factories.

122
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,031
More if they bring in conscription,
which I say is bound to happen

123
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,616
if Herr Hitler doesn't pipe down.

124
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,868
He's about as likely to do that as buy shares

125
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,287
in Marks and Spencer's,
wouldn't you agree?

126
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,373
-This isn't very good.
-I make a cocktail with crushed ice,

127
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:42,127
rum and melted dark chocolate.
It's absolutely scrumptious.

128
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,970
Guess who we met on the way in?
-Robbie.

129
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:55,140
-I told him to join us tonight.
-Oh, Leon, you didn't.

130
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,104
So, Robbie, the housekeeper's son,
whose father did a bunk 20 years ago,

131
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,900
gets a scholarship to the local grammar,
the Old Man puts him through Cambridge,

132
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:09,363
goes up at the same time as Cee, and
for three years she hardly speaks to him.

133
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,490
Wouldn't let him within a mile
of her Roedean chums.

134
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,450
Anyone got a cigarette?

135
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,286
I don't know what the hell he's doing
these days, messing about in flower beds.

136
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,539
As a matter of fact, he's planning on doing
a medical degree.

137
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,291
And the Old Man said yes to that?

138
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,006
Look, I really think you should go down
to the lodge and ask him not to come.

139
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,801
Why? Has something happened
between you?

140
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,387
For God's sake.

141
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,751
-When can we go home?
Soon.

142
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,087
We can't go home. It's a divorce.

143
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,718
-How dare you say that?
-Well, it's true!

144
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:16,305
You will never, ever use that word
again! Do you understand?

145
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:20,893
-Now what are we going to do?
-I'm always asking myself that.

146
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:24,938
My name is Paul Marshall.
You must be the cousins from the north.

147
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,191
-What are your names?
-Pierrot.

148
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,568
-Jackson.
-What marvellous names.

149
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,904
Do you know our parents?

150
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,405
Well, I've read
about them in the paper.

151
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:38,035
-What exactly have you read about them?
-Oh, you know. The usual sort of nonsense.

152
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,997
I'll thank you not to talk about this
in front of the children.

153
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,545
Your parents
are absolutely wonderful people,

154
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:52,925
that's quite clear, and they love you
and think about you all the time.

155
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,552
Jolly nice slacks.

156
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,263
We went to see a show
and I got them at Liberty's.

157
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:01,642
-What was the show?
-Hamlet.

158
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,187
Ah, yes. "To be or not to be."

159
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,944
I like your shoes.

160
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:19,576
Duckers in the Turl. They make
a wooden thing, shaped like your foot.

161
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,662
Keep it forever.

162
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,790
I'm starving. When's dinner?

163
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,877
Well, I might be able to help you there,
if you can guess what I do for a living.

164
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,547
-You've got a chocolate factory.
-Everyone knows that.

165
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,466
Then it wasn't a guess, was it?

166
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,512
There'll be one of these in every kit bag
of every soldier in the British Army.

167
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,722
Sugar casing, so it won't melt.

168
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,933
Why should they get free sweets?

169
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,518
'Cause they'll be fighting for their country.

170
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,937
Our daddy says
there isn't going to be a war.

171
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,189
Your daddy is wrong.

172
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:54,778
-Calling it the Army Amo.
-Amo, amas, amat.

173
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,989
Top marks.

174
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:01,618
It's boring how everything ends in "o."
"Polo" and "Aero."

175
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,329
-And "Oxo" and "Brillo".
-Sounds as if you don't want it.

176
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,541
Then I shall just have to give it
to your sister.

177
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,136
Bite it.

178
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,056
You have to bite it.

179
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:35,152
The Princess was well aware
of his remorseless wickedness.

180
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,864
But that made it no easier to overcome
the voluminous love she felt

181
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:42,117
in her heart for Sir Romulus.
The Princess knew instinctively

182
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,244
that the one with red hair
was not to be trusted.

183
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,748
As his young ward dived again
and again to the depths of the lake,

184
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:52,044
in search of the enchanted chalice,
Sir Romulus twirled his luxuriant moustache.

185
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:56,715
Sir Romulus rode with his two companions,
northwards, drawing ever closer

186
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,050
to an effulgent sea.

187
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,345
So heroic in manner,
he appeared so valiant in word

188
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,848
no one could ever guess at the darkness

189
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,518
lurking in the black heart
of Sir Romulus Turnbull.

190
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,521
He was the most dangerous man
in the world.

191
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,282
"Dear Cecilia, I thought I should write
to apologise for my clumsy

192
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,243
"and inconsiderate behaviour."

193
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,001
"Forgive me if I seem strange but I'm..."

194
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,591
Dear Cecilia, you'd be forgiven
for thinking me mad,

195
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,467
the way I acted this afternoon.

196
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:31,597
The truth is I feel rather lightheaded
and foolish in your presence, Cee,

197
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,016
and I don't think I can blame the heat.

198
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,269
"Will you forgive me?

199
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,607
"Robbie."

200
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,626
Off out then?

201
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,295
Yes, Leon's asked me
to join them for dinner.

202
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:07,841
So that's why I've been polishing
silver all afternoon.

203
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:11,136
I'll think of you when I see my face
in the spoon.

204
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:19,394
You're not a bit like your father.
Not in any way.

205
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:22,314
That's because I'm all yours. I'll be late.

206
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,860
Your shirts are hanging upstairs.

207
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,449
-Son.
-Yes?

208
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,535
Nothing.

209
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:29,131
Briony! Is that you?

210
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:53,697
Are you all right?

211
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,703
Do you think you could do me a favour?

212
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,624
Could you run ahead
and give this to Cee? I...

213
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:08,420
-Feel a bit of a fool handing it over myself.
-All right.

214
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:35,405
Briony.

215
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:04,184
Briony!

216
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:26,915
-I suppose he's what you might call eligible.
-Rather.

217
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:29,168
He certainly seems to think
he's the cat's pyjamas.

218
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:32,588
Which is odd, considering he has pubic hair
growing out of his ears.

219
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:36,133
I should imagine he'd give you
a lot of very noisy, boneheaded sons.

220
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,594
-He's quite a good egg, actually.
-You say that about everyone.

221
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:42,472
-Leon!
-Rummy, if it ain't my little sis!

222
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:45,559
I wrote you a play, Leon.
I wanted to do a play for you.

223
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,436
-The Trials Of Arabella.
-Well, there's still time.

224
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,104
-Doesn't have to be this evening.
-No, it's impossible.

225
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:50,606
Briony.
Tell you what. I'm good at voices,

226
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,524
you're even better,
so we'll read it out after dinner.

227
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,527
-Briony, did you read this letter?
-Yes, let's. That's a wonderful idea.

228
00:28:55,611 --> 00:29:00,032
-Briony!
-Here we are. My choc-tail.

229
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,409
I insist you try it.

230
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,245
Wasn't there an envelope?

231
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,383
Do you mind if I come in?

232
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,429
I've had the most appalling evening.

233
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,517
The twins have been torturing me. Look.

234
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,935
How awful.

235
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,397
Chinese burns.

236
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,943
That's right.

237
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:41,114
They want to go home.
They think it's me that's keeping them here.

238
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,330
Lola.

239
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,418
Can I tell you something?
Something really terrible.

240
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:54,795
Yes, please.

241
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:58,757
What's the worst word
you can possibly imagine?

242
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:11,603
-He's a sex maniac!
-That's right.

243
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:13,188
-What's Cecilia going to do?
-I don't know.

244
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:15,858
-You ought to call the police.
-Do you think so?

245
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,652
He said he thought about it all day long.

246
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,904
All you have to do is show them the letter.

247
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,782
-You won't tell anyone, will you, promise?
-I promise.

248
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:27,077
Good. If he found out,
there's no knowing what he might do.

249
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,370
You're right.

250
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:33,917
You better tidy your face.
I've still got to change.

251
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,839
Thanks, Briony. You're a real brick.

252
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:01,440
Cecilia!

253
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,127
-It was a mistake.
-Briony read it.

254
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:24,671
My God, I'm so sorry.
It was the wrong version.

255
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,048
Yes.

256
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:31,970
-It was never meant to be read.
-No.

257
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:08,841
What was in the version
I was meant to read?

258
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,884
I don't know. It was more formal. Less...

259
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:12,594
-Anatomical?
-Yes.

260
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:23,438
It's been there for weeks,
and then this morning by the fountain...

261
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,617
I've never done anything like that before.

262
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:38,912
And I was so angry with you,
and with myself.

263
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:45,252
I thought if you went away to medical
school, then I'd be happy, but...

264
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:48,922
I don't know how I could have been
so ignorant about myself, so...

265
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:54,386
So stupid.

266
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,937
You do know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

267
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:09,443
You knew before I did.

268
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,946
Why are you crying?

269
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,116
Don't you know?

270
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:18,368
Yes, I know exactly.

271
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:03,765
Robbie.

272
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,809
Cecilia.

273
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:08,854
I love you.

274
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:12,774
I love you.

275
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,609
Someone's come in.

276
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,529
Cecilia!

277
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:44,533
People were sitting out
having dinner on the pavement.

278
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:49,037
It was always the view of my parents
that hot weather encouraged loose morals.

279
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,498
In high summer, my sister and l
were never allowed out of the house.

280
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:55,294
They thought the villagers would be
unnecessarily provoked.

281
00:38:57,212 --> 00:39:01,091
What do you say, Cee? Does the hot weather
make you behave badly?

282
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:05,846
-Good heavens, you're blushing.
-It's just hot in here, that's all.

283
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,515
Lola, wipe that lipstick off.
You're far too young.

284
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:12,311
What about you, Briony?
What sins have you committed today?

285
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:16,481
-I've done nothing wrong.
Have you seen the twins recently?

286
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:19,276
They didn't look very happy
last time I saw them, poor little chaps.

287
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,738
You know nothing about it.
-Briony. I can't imagine what's got into you.

288
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:25,365
-I've never known you to be so rude.
Well, they're not poor little chaps.

289
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,576
-Just look what they did to Lola.
-What are you talking about?

290
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:30,871
Jackson and Pierrot
bruised her arm. Gave her Chinese burns.

291
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,873
I'm afraid she's quite right.
I had to pull them off her.

292
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:35,292
How I got my war wound.

293
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,793
The twins did that, Lola?

294
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,754
Yes, it all turned
into a bit of a wrestle,

295
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:41,173
I'm afraid. Still, no harm done, eh, Lola?

296
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:42,925
Would you go and find these boys,
please, Briony?

297
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,718
Tell them dinner's ready,
and where are their manners?

298
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,720
-Why do I have to go?
-Briony, you'll do as you're told,

299
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:49,306
or you'll go straight to your room.

300
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:19,920
It's a letter!
-Give it to me!

301
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,588
They've run away.
Who has?

302
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,006
The twins.

303
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:28,929
"We are going to run away because Lola
is so horrid to us and we want to go home.

304
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:32,140
-"Also, there wasn't a play."
-Don't worry.

305
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:34,476
We'll send out some search parties.
They can't have gone far.

306
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,603
Cee, you come with me.

307
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:43,485
Pierrot!

308
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,404
Jackson!

309
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:47,739
Boys!

310
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,033
Jackson!

311
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:53,328
Pierrot!

312
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:35,430
Lola? Are you all right?

313
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:38,851
I'm sorry. I didn't... I'm sorry.

314
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:41,019
Who was it?

315
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:44,606
I saw him.

316
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:46,733
I saw him.

317
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,028
-It was him, wasn't it?
-Yes, it was him.

318
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:51,697
Lola, who was it?

319
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:57,286
It was Robbie, wasn't it? Robbie?

320
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,748
-You saw him?
-Like you said, he's a sex maniac.

321
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:04,585
And you don't even know
what happened before dinner.

322
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,253
I caught him attacking my sister
in the library.

323
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,547
I don't know what he'd have done
if I hadn't come in.

324
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,092
-You actually saw him?
-Of course I did. Plain as day.

325
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:18,223
He pushed me to the ground.
And then he put his hands over my eyes.

326
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:24,479
-I couldn't actually... I never actually...
-Listen. I've known him

327
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:26,773
my whole life, and I saw him.

328
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:29,943
Because I couldn't say for sure.

329
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,489
Well, I can. And I will.

330
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:41,872
Call the police.
And she'll be needing a doctor, as well.

331
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:57,095
-It's all right, dear. It's all right now.
Is Robbie back yet?

332
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:59,389
I haven't seen him.

333
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,642
I know who it was.

334
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:07,564
-You saw him, then?
-Yes, I saw him.

335
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:10,692
-Just as you see me?
-I know it was him.

336
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:14,154
You know it was him? Or you saw him?

337
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:18,992
-Yes, I did, I saw him.
-With your own eyes?

338
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:23,789
Yes. I saw him, I saw him with my own eyes.

339
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:29,336
Well done, darling.

340
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:24,433
My brother and I found the two of them
down by the lake.

341
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,643
You didn't see anyone else?

342
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:33,567
I wouldn't necessarily believe everything
Briony tells you. She's rather fanciful.

343
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:44,912
When they went looking,
I went up to my dad's.

344
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:47,623
-I did, honest.
Why was that?

345
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,667
To tell him all about it.

346
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:56,256
-I know I shouldn't have opened it.
No, you should not.

347
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:00,719
But at least you've done the right thing now.

348
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,010
Sir, there is someone coming.

349
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:13,083
-Time you went to bed.
-But...

350
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:14,293
Now.

351
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:28,367
Cecilia!

352
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,270
You liars! You liars! Liars! Liars!

353
00:49:36,185 --> 00:49:38,353
Northern France
Four years later

354
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:47,362
I says to him, I says, "You can sit
down there, twiddling your thumbs,

355
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:49,531
"waiting to get your head blown off,
if you want to.

356
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:50,782
"I'm off out of it."

357
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:04,421
Bonsoir monsieur. Bonsoir?
Let me do this.

358
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:21,063
What's his game?

359
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:23,440
-He says he's got something for us.
-Fucking hell!

360
00:50:24,775 --> 00:50:26,985
Wait! We have food for you

361
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,237
Bread, sugar

362
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,404
And wine!

363
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,458
What are you doing here?

364
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:51,260
When the retreat started, Panzers attacked,

365
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:54,429
and I was separated from my unit

366
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:57,099
So it's true, the English are retreating

367
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:02,604
We'll be gone at first light

368
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:07,025
We fought all those years,
lost all those dead,

369
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:09,987
now the Germans are in France again

370
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:14,950
We will come back

371
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,787
we will throw them out

372
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:23,417
I promise you

373
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:26,461
Good luck

374
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:32,843
Come on, then.

375
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:36,930
How come a toff like you, talks French
and everything, ends up a private?

376
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:40,642
Not eligible for officers' training
if you join direct from prison.

377
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:44,062
-You're pulling my tit.
-No, I'm not.

378
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:49,109
They gave me a choice.
Stay in prison or join the Army.

379
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:53,322
And for the record,
the last thing I am is a toff.

380
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:14,343
Six months earlier

381
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,038
I'm sorry I'm late, I got lost.

382
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:44,915
-Hello.
-Hello.

383
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:57,219
-Should we sit down?
-Yes, of course.

384
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:15,487
-I'm sorry, I can't remember, l...
-Two. Thank you.

385
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:51,940
Where are you living?

386
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:55,944
Tiny flat in Balham. It's ghastly.

387
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:59,323
-The landlady's rude and horribly nosy.
-You look the same.

388
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:01,909
-Apart from the uniform, of course.
-Yes, I'm sorry. I've got to go back

389
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:05,120
-to the hospital in half an hour.
-Oh, God, that...

390
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:27,893
-Sorry.
-No.

391
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:34,608
Have you been in touch with your family?

392
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:36,735
No, I told you I wouldn't.

393
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:40,614
Leon waited outside the hospital last week,
I just pushed past him.

394
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:43,450
Cee, you don't owe me anything.

395
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:48,205
Robbie, didn't you read my letters?

396
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:50,833
Had I been allowed to visit you,
had they let me every day,

397
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:53,418
-I would have been there every day.
-Yes, but...

398
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:57,089
If all we have rests on a few moments

399
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:59,758
in a library three and a half years ago,
then I'm not sure,

400
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:02,970
-I don't know if...
-Robbie, look at me.

401
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,767
Look at me.

402
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:11,228
Come back.

403
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:16,150
Come back to me.

404
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:32,166
Dearest Cecilia.

405
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:36,003
Dearest Cecilia.

406
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,386
Cecilia.

407
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:01,987
A friend of mine has a cottage by the coast.

408
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,406
Said we can borrow it
when you're next on leave.

409
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,618
White clapboard
with blue-painted window frames.

410
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:12,789
-I hope this bus never comes.
-Here.

411
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,794
Something to think of while you're away.

412
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:41,360
I love you.

413
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:14,286
Some poor sod's gonna catch a packet.

414
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:27,090
My darling. Briony found
my address somehow, and sent a letter.

415
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,053
The first surprise was
she didn't go up to Cambridge.

416
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:33,931
She's doing nurse's training
at my old hospital.

417
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,935
I think she may be doing this
as some kind of penance.

418
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:42,731
She says she's beginning to get the full
grasp of what she did, and what it meant.

419
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:45,359
She wants to come and talk to me.

420
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:51,448
I love you. I'll wait for you. Come back.

421
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:53,951
Come back to me.

422
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:57,704
Come back. Come back to me.

423
00:58:58,747 --> 00:59:01,917
Come back. Come back to me.

424
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:07,339
So where we going, guv?

425
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,314
Fucking hate those boots!

426
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:27,192
I hate them worse
than all the fucking Germans put together!

427
00:59:27,276 --> 00:59:30,445
You'll have a job getting back to England
in your socks.

428
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,963
Come on, pal,
you should be getting dressed.

429
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:14,216
-If I fell in, would you save me?
-Of course.

430
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:27,938
Briony!

431
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:54,381
Thank you.

432
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,141
Thank you! Thank you, thank you!

433
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:06,977
That's an incredibly bloody
stupid thing to do.

434
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:08,479
I wanted you to save me.
-Don't you know

435
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:10,230
how easily you could have drowned?

436
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:13,400
-You saved me.
-Stupid child!

437
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:17,321
You could have killed us both.
Is that your idea of a joke?

438
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:21,783
I want to thank you for saving my life.

439
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:25,579
I will be eternally grateful to you.

440
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:39,968
The story can resume.

441
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:44,806
Our story can resume. I will simply resume.

442
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:47,893
Jerry, come and have a go at us
in fucking South End.

443
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:52,981
Or better still, Trafalgar Square.
No one speaks the fucking lingo out here.

444
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:55,984
You can't say, "Pass the biscuit," or
"Where's me hand grenade?"

445
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:59,613
They just shrug. Because they hate us, too.
I mean, that's the point.

446
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:03,116
We fight in France
and the French fucking hate us.

447
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,370
Make me Home Secretary,
I'll sort this out in a fucking minute.

448
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:08,956
We got India and Africa, right?

449
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,417
Jerry can have France and Belgium
and wherever else they want.

450
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:16,380
Who's fucking ever been to Poland?
It's all about room, empire.

451
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:19,550
They want more empire,
give 'em this shithole, we keep ours,

452
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:22,761
and it's "Bob's your uncle"
and "Fanny's your fucking aunt"!

453
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:24,429
Think about it.

454
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:37,651
Dearest Cecilia.
The story can resume.

455
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:43,240
The one I had been planning
on that evening walk.

456
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:47,536
I can become again the man
who once crossed the Surrey park

457
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:52,166
at dusk in my best suit,
swaggering on the promise of life.

458
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:56,879
The man who, with the clarity of passion,
made love to you in the library.

459
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:03,343
The story can resume.

460
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:10,100
I will return,

461
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:13,020
find you, love you,

462
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:16,607
marry you. And live without shame.

463
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:35,918
You can smell the sea.

464
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:09,284
Fuck me.

465
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:15,499
-It's like something out of the Bible.
Jesus Christ.

466
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:19,878
Come on, get everybody
to clean this mess up now.

467
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:22,881
We've just arrived, sir. Can you
tell us what we're supposed to be doing?

468
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:25,259
Nothing. Just wait.
Where are the ships?

469
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:28,011
A few made it in yesterday,
Luftwaffe blew them to buggery.

470
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:30,889
Lost 3,000 men
when they sank the Lancastria.

471
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:34,434
High command, in its infinite wisdom,
is denying us air cover.

472
01:05:34,518 --> 01:05:36,395
A disgrace, a fucking disaster.

473
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:39,148
No, look, the thing is, you see,
I'm expected back, you see.

474
01:05:39,231 --> 01:05:42,985
There's over 300,000 men on this beach,
Private. You'll have to wait your turn.

475
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:47,447
Just be grateful you're not wounded.
I've orders to leave the wounded behind.

476
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:52,911
No, no, no, leave it, guv! Never trust a sailor
on dry land. You're best off out of it.

477
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:08,719
That's not right.

478
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,495
Christ.

479
01:06:41,877 --> 01:06:43,754
Can you hear me, laddies?

480
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,173
I'm coming home!

481
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:49,444
Take from our souls
the strain and stress

482
01:07:49,528 --> 01:07:53,866
And let our ordered lives confess

483
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:58,120
The beauty of Thy peace

484
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:03,125
The beauty of Thy peace

485
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:08,213
Breathe through the heats of our desire

486
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:12,593
Thy coolness and Thy balm

487
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:17,097
Let sense be numb, let flesh retire

488
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:21,518
Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire

489
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:25,856
O still, small voice of calm

490
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:57,596
Guv'nor.

491
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:03,852
I have to get something to drink.

492
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:06,480
You need one. You're grey.

493
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:09,399
He's gone all grey, can you see?

494
01:09:25,415 --> 01:09:27,167
There. Come on.

495
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:31,046
All I want's a cup of tea now.

496
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:50,816
What the fuck you doing?

497
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:21,472
I'm coming home!
Laddie, I'm coming home!

498
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:30,814
Fuck 'em all! Fuck 'em all!
The long and the short and the tall

499
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:35,736
Fuck all the Sergeants and WO1s
Fuck all the corporals

500
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:37,362
and their bastard sons

501
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:43,744
'Cause we're saying goodbye to them all
As back to their billets they crawl

502
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:47,247
You'll get no promotion
this side of the ocean

503
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:51,084
So cheer up, my lads
Fuck 'em all!

504
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:02,698
Mike!

505
01:12:09,454 --> 01:12:10,914
Mike!

506
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:14,626
Hold up, guv.

507
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:24,344
Wait here.

508
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,386
Why don't you sit down?

509
01:13:15,103 --> 01:13:17,022
It's so hot in here.

510
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:19,483
Take off your boots.

511
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:42,506
I have to get back. I promised her.

512
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:44,800
To put things right.

513
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:49,138
And she loves me. She's waiting for me.

514
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:54,393
Oi!

515
01:13:57,729 --> 01:13:58,897
Wait, wait, wait.

516
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:03,152
Hey, what have you done with your boots?

517
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:08,407
-Look, you're sure you're feeling all right?
-Never better.

518
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:12,536
Now I'm wondering whether the beach
really is the best place for dinner.

519
01:14:14,204 --> 01:14:19,251
-I'm not sure, I don't recognise it.
-Dunno.

520
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:21,545
-This'll do, down here.
-No.

521
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:25,257
-No, no, it's further on.
-What is?

522
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,551
This place I know, an old cottage
with white clapboards

523
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:30,220
and blue-painted window frames.

524
01:14:32,097 --> 01:14:36,143
Aw, yes.
That's right, that's where we're going.

525
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:40,397
-It's close to here.
-We're there. This is it.

526
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:05,631
Here we are, guv. Down here.

527
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:45,087
That's all right, guv. That's right.

528
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:51,677
Get your head down. Get your head down.
There you go.

529
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:10,112
Tuck yourself in. Keep yourself warm.

530
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:21,999
Chew on a bit of this. But quiet like,
or they'll all be wanting some.

531
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:27,713
Try and get some sleep.

532
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,806
Find you.

533
01:18:02,141 --> 01:18:03,392
Love you.

534
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:05,686
Marry you.

535
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,397
And live without shame.

536
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:44,850
I love you. Come back. Come back to me.

537
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:53,192
Bit too much noise, guv'nor.
-What?

538
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,821
-What noise?
-You keep shouting.

539
01:18:57,905 --> 01:19:00,824
-Some of the lads are getting a bit peeved.
-What?

540
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:17,633
-Christ. You look a bit rough.
-Thing is, I've decided to stay on for a bit.

541
01:19:18,759 --> 01:19:22,054
I'm meeting someone,
and I'm always keeping her waiting.

542
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:25,724
Now, listen. Listen to me, guv'nor.

543
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:30,604
I went out for a Jimmy Riddle just now.
Guess what I saw!

544
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:34,399
They're getting themselves sorted out
down on the beach.

545
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:39,488
The boats are back, and a geezer from
the Buffs is marching us down at 7:00.

546
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:43,784
We're away. We're off home, mate.

547
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:50,082
So get some more sleep, and no more
of your bleeding shouting.

548
01:19:50,165 --> 01:19:54,378
-All right?
-I won't say a word.

549
01:19:57,214 --> 01:20:00,050
Wake me before 7:00, would you?
Thanks so much.

550
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:07,432
You won't hear another word
from me. Promise.

551
01:20:12,146 --> 01:20:15,774
London
Three weeks earlier

552
01:20:57,274 --> 01:20:59,902
Bed castors should be lined up
and pointing inwards.

553
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:03,197
I found three yesterday that weren't.
You know who you are.

554
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,616
Which of you were responsible
for putting away the blankets today?

555
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,743
I was, Sister.
-I don't suppose you can tell us

556
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:09,286
-what you did wrong?
-No, Sister.

557
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:11,163
Labels are folded to the inside,
are they not?

558
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:12,664
-Yes, Sister.
-Do them again.

559
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:17,085
Nurse Tallis, I'll see you in my office.
The rest of you are excused.

560
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:33,185
-ls this job at all important to you, Tallis?
-Very important, Sister.

561
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:35,479
Yesterday, you were seconded
to men's surgical.

562
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:38,565
When your patient came round from his
anaesthetic, it seems the first thing he did

563
01:21:38,649 --> 01:21:41,109
was to ask for Briony.
Who might Briony be?

564
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:44,363
-Well, me, Sister.
-There is no Briony.

565
01:21:44,446 --> 01:21:47,908
You are Tallis. Nurse Tallis.
Is that understood?

566
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:49,159
Yes, Sister.

567
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:00,796
There is no Briony.

568
01:22:05,008 --> 01:22:08,595
This is the BBC
Home Service. Here is the news.

569
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:12,141
The BEF, with their French allies,
are fighting a desperate battle

570
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:14,560
in the northern zone of the Western Front.

571
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:19,064
The Allied Forces have not lost
cohesion, and their morale is high.

572
01:22:19,148 --> 01:22:22,025
The RAF continues to give all the support
in its power

573
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:25,362
to the Allied armies in northeastern
France and Belgium. Railways, roads,

574
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:29,283
bridges and enemy troops have been
continuously attacked, yesterday...

575
01:22:46,592 --> 01:22:49,887
Thanks. I never could make the scissors
work with my left hand.

576
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:52,097
Mummy always did it for me.

577
01:22:53,474 --> 01:22:55,267
There, you're done.

578
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:00,856
Bother!

579
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:08,363
Night-night, Ponty.

580
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:11,575
Good night, Tallis.

581
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:29,218
Don't panic! It's only me.

582
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:33,013
Fiona, I almost jumped out of my skin.

583
01:23:33,806 --> 01:23:36,809
So this is where you duck to after lights out.

584
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:41,104
I thought you might be in the middle
of some tempestuous romance.

585
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,191
Don't you freeze to death up here?

586
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,237
I love London.

587
01:23:49,947 --> 01:23:52,324
Do you think all of this will be
bombed and just disappear?

588
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:53,492
No.

589
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:56,703
I don't know.

590
01:23:57,621 --> 01:23:59,915
Do you write about Sister Drummond?

591
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:03,126
-Do you write about me?
-Sometimes.

592
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:07,840
-Can I look?
-I'd rather you didn't. It's private.

593
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:12,302
I don't see any point in writing a story
if you're not going to let anyone read it.

594
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:14,847
-It's not ready yet. It's unfinished.
-What's it about?

595
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:24,481
-It's complicated.
-Yes?

596
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:25,774
It's just...

597
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:33,198
It's about a young girl, a young and
foolish girl, who sees something from

598
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:37,828
her bedroom window which she doesn't
understand, but she thinks she does.

599
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:43,625
I probably won't ever finish it.

600
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:47,421
I look at you, Tallis,
and you're so mysterious.

601
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:50,507
I've never been mysterious.

602
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:55,012
-Do you know what I decided tonight?
-What?

603
01:24:57,473 --> 01:25:01,059
I could never marry a man
who wasn't in the Royal Navy.

604
01:25:10,736 --> 01:25:13,530
Here we are. Cecilia Tallis.

605
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:16,200
I think this is her address.

606
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:19,411
Thank you.

607
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:32,174
Dear Cecilia. Please don't
throw this away without reading it.

608
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,803
As you'll have seen from the
notepaper, I'm here at St Thomas'

609
01:25:35,886 --> 01:25:38,138
doing my nurses' training.

610
01:25:38,222 --> 01:25:40,724
I decided not to take up
my place at Cambridge.

611
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:42,184
Oh, God.

612
01:25:43,852 --> 01:25:47,648
I decided I wanted to make myself useful.
Do something practical.

613
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,445
It says in the newspaper
the Army are making strategic withdrawals.

614
01:25:53,529 --> 01:25:54,613
Yes, I saw that.

615
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:56,740
It's a euphemism for retreat.

616
01:25:58,075 --> 01:26:01,787
No matter how hard I work,
no matter how long the hours,

617
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:05,165
I can't escape from what I did

618
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:08,293
and what it meant,

619
01:26:08,377 --> 01:26:12,089
the full extent of which
I am only now beginning to grasp.

620
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:22,015
Cee, please write and tell me we can meet.

621
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:25,602
Your sister, Briony.

622
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:30,816
So do you?
-Do I what?

623
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:35,529
Have a secret fiancé in France.
That's what everyone thinks.

624
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:36,655
No, of course not.

625
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:39,324
Imagine not knowing if he'd ever come back.

626
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:41,577
I've never been in love.

627
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:45,038
What, never? Not even a crush?

628
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:49,168
Oh, I had a crush once, when I was 10 or 11.

629
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:54,715
I jumped into a river to see
if he'd save me from drowning.

630
01:26:54,798 --> 01:26:58,302
-Now you're teasing me.
-Oh, no. And he did save me.

631
01:27:01,305 --> 01:27:04,975
But as soon as I told him I loved him,
the feeling sort of disappeared.

632
01:27:05,058 --> 01:27:06,643
Something's happened.

633
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,608
Outside, quickly.

634
01:27:56,777 --> 01:27:58,028
Robbie.

635
01:28:02,074 --> 01:28:03,158
Excuse me.

636
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:56,295
Nurse Tallis, you speak a little French,
if I remember rightly.

637
01:28:56,378 --> 01:28:57,629
Only school French, Sister.

638
01:28:57,713 --> 01:29:02,050
There's a soldier in Bed 13. Go and sit
with him for a minute. Hold his hand.

639
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:03,260
Off you go.

640
01:29:57,231 --> 01:29:58,732
Here you are at last

641
01:29:59,608 --> 01:30:01,235
Sister sent me

642
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:03,570
for a little chat

643
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:08,659
I remember your sister

644
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:11,703
she was always so nice

645
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:14,998
what's she doing now?

646
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:20,212
She is a nurse as well

647
01:30:21,255 --> 01:30:24,383
Did she finally marry that man
she was so in love with?

648
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,468
I've forgotten his name

649
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:27,636
Robbie?

650
01:30:29,388 --> 01:30:30,889
She will soon I hope

651
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:32,933
Robbie

652
01:30:33,559 --> 01:30:35,394
yes that's right

653
01:30:37,688 --> 01:30:38,772
And you?

654
01:30:39,106 --> 01:30:40,649
What is your name?

655
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:43,902
Luc.

656
01:30:45,404 --> 01:30:46,822
Luc Cornet.

657
01:30:49,032 --> 01:30:50,284
And you?

658
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:51,451
Tallis.

659
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:53,912
Tallis.

660
01:30:55,747 --> 01:30:57,666
That's pretty

661
01:31:02,588 --> 01:31:05,215
I remember you now

662
01:31:07,176 --> 01:31:09,303
the English girl

663
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:13,307
You remember your first visit to Millau?

664
01:31:14,641 --> 01:31:17,186
I was working by the ovens with my father.

665
01:31:18,187 --> 01:31:20,355
I heard your accent

666
01:31:24,485 --> 01:31:27,237
Can you do me a little favour Tallis?

667
01:31:29,156 --> 01:31:31,825
These bandages are so tight,

668
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:35,287
can you loosen them a bit, please?

669
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:37,831
Of course

670
01:31:45,714 --> 01:31:48,050
You remember my younger sister, Anne?

671
01:31:50,469 --> 01:31:53,514
She still plays that little Debussy piece

672
01:31:55,265 --> 01:31:56,683
do you remember?

673
01:31:59,061 --> 01:32:02,147
She looks so serious when she plays

674
01:32:03,273 --> 01:32:05,150
And our croissants,

675
01:32:05,776 --> 01:32:07,611
what did you think of them?

676
01:32:15,244 --> 01:32:17,412
The most delicious in Millau

677
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:18,872
Yes.

678
01:32:19,081 --> 01:32:21,208
it's the quality of the butter

679
01:32:22,918 --> 01:32:23,961
Yes

680
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:29,925
Is that why you came every day?

681
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:32,970
Because you know,

682
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:38,392
my mother is very fond of you

683
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:40,811
in her opinion,

684
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:44,064
we should get married in the summer

685
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:45,899
Oh yes?

686
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:47,651
Yes

687
01:32:55,617 --> 01:32:57,995
I hope that's more comfortable

688
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:03,959
Do you love me?

689
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:06,044
Yes

690
01:33:14,428 --> 01:33:16,889
Can you stay a while?

691
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:21,435
I'm frightened

692
01:33:30,777 --> 01:33:32,404
-Tallis.
-Briony.

693
01:33:34,156 --> 01:33:35,949
Je m'appelle Briony.

694
01:33:47,795 --> 01:33:49,880
Stand up, Nurse Tallis.

695
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:57,596
Now go and wash the blood off your face.

696
01:34:59,449 --> 01:35:04,413
The Navy has earned our
undying gratitude. The Army is undefeated.

697
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:08,250
Courage has brought them through
unconquered, their spirit unbowed.

698
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:10,419
This is the epic of Dunkirk.

699
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:14,756
A name that will live forever
in the annals of warfare.

700
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:20,721
In the course of a comprehensive tour,

701
01:35:20,804 --> 01:35:24,558
Queen Elizabeth is seen here visiting
a chocolate factory in the north of England.

702
01:35:24,641 --> 01:35:26,977
The confectionary magnate
and friend of the British Army,

703
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:31,315
Mr Paul Marshall, gave the Queen a tour
of the Army Amo factory

704
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:35,777
with his lovely,
soon-to-be-wed fiancée, Miss Lola Quincey.

705
01:35:35,861 --> 01:35:38,614
What a mouthwatering couple they are.

706
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:42,284
Keep the Amo coming.
Our boys have a sweet tooth.

707
01:36:09,895 --> 01:36:15,859
Secondly, for a remedy against sin,
and to avoid fornication,

708
01:36:15,943 --> 01:36:19,822
that such persons
as have not the gift of continence,

709
01:36:19,905 --> 01:36:25,494
might marry and keep themselves
undefiled members of Christ's body.

710
01:36:26,328 --> 01:36:31,542
Thirdly, it was ordained,
for the mutual society, help and comfort,

711
01:36:31,625 --> 01:36:35,170
that the one ought to have the other.

712
01:36:35,254 --> 01:36:36,380
I saw him.

713
01:36:36,463 --> 01:36:40,384
Therefore, if any man can show
any just cause

714
01:36:40,467 --> 01:36:43,428
why they may not be
lawfully joined together...

715
01:36:43,595 --> 01:36:44,638
I know it was him.

716
01:36:44,888 --> 01:36:50,352
...Iet him now speak
or forever hold his peace.

717
01:36:56,942 --> 01:36:59,653
I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.

718
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:43,780
Let the nursey through.

719
01:37:43,864 --> 01:37:46,366
They're going down to the country today.
Never been out of London before.

720
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:47,659
I hope they get a nice family.

721
01:37:47,743 --> 01:37:49,995
They don't know what they're in for
with this lot.

722
01:37:50,078 --> 01:37:51,163
Come on.

723
01:38:09,264 --> 01:38:12,351
I'm looking for Miss Tallis. Cecilia Tallis.

724
01:38:13,769 --> 01:38:14,853
Is she in?

725
01:38:20,984 --> 01:38:23,487
Tallis! Door!

726
01:38:31,286 --> 01:38:33,539
I tried writing. You wouldn't answer.

727
01:38:38,544 --> 01:38:40,420
I have to talk to you.

728
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:07,447
-So you're a ward sister now?
-Yes.

729
01:39:20,836 --> 01:39:21,920
Thanks.

730
01:39:31,305 --> 01:39:33,348
I want to go in front of a judge
and change my evidence, Cee.

731
01:39:33,432 --> 01:39:35,142
Don't call me that.

732
01:39:40,772 --> 01:39:42,774
Please don't call me that.

733
01:39:45,736 --> 01:39:48,113
I know what I did was terrible.
I don't expect you to forgive me.

734
01:39:48,197 --> 01:39:50,240
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

735
01:39:52,367 --> 01:39:54,912
You're an unreliable witness.
They'll never reopen the case.

736
01:39:54,995 --> 01:39:56,747
Well, at least
I could tell everyone else what I did.

737
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:59,249
I can go home and explain
to Mummy and Daddy and Leon...

738
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:01,585
-So what's stopping you?
-Well, I wanted to see you first.

739
01:40:01,668 --> 01:40:03,879
They don't want to hear any more about it.

740
01:40:03,962 --> 01:40:07,174
That unpleasantness is all tidied away
in the past, thank you very much.

741
01:40:07,257 --> 01:40:08,383
But...

742
01:40:16,391 --> 01:40:18,644
I'll be late. Better get moving.

743
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:23,524
Excuse me.

744
01:40:29,905 --> 01:40:31,782
He sleeps so deeply.

745
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:35,387
-What is she doing here?
-She wanted to speak to me.

746
01:41:35,471 --> 01:41:37,347
Oh, yes, what about?

747
01:41:37,431 --> 01:41:38,807
The terrible thing I did.

748
01:41:38,891 --> 01:41:40,392
Robbie. Darling.

749
01:41:44,396 --> 01:41:46,398
I'll be quite honest with you.

750
01:41:46,482 --> 01:41:47,941
I'm torn between breaking your neck here

751
01:41:48,025 --> 01:41:51,028
and taking you
and throwing you down the stairs.

752
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:52,237
Oh, God.

753
01:41:52,321 --> 01:41:56,408
Do you have any idea what it's like in jail?
Of course, you don't.

754
01:41:56,783 --> 01:41:59,369
Tell me, did it give you pleasure
to think of me inside?

755
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:01,288
-No.
-But you did nothing about it.

756
01:42:01,371 --> 01:42:03,081
-No.
-Do you think I assaulted your cousin?

757
01:42:03,165 --> 01:42:04,249
-No.
-Did you think it then?

758
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:05,417
Yes. But yes and no.

759
01:42:05,501 --> 01:42:07,419
-And what's made you so certain now?
-Growing up.

760
01:42:07,503 --> 01:42:09,046
-Growing up?
-I was 13.

761
01:42:09,129 --> 01:42:12,299
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

762
01:42:12,382 --> 01:42:13,801
What are you, 18?

763
01:42:13,884 --> 01:42:16,762
Do you have to be 18 before
you can bring yourself to own up to a lie?

764
01:42:16,845 --> 01:42:20,933
There are soldiers of 18, old enough
to be left to die by the side of the road,

765
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:22,434
-did you know that?
-Yes.

766
01:42:22,518 --> 01:42:24,812
Five years ago,
you didn't care about telling the truth.

767
01:42:24,895 --> 01:42:28,232
You, all your family, you just assumed
that for all my education,

768
01:42:28,315 --> 01:42:31,443
I was still little better than a servant.
Still not to be trusted!

769
01:42:31,527 --> 01:42:34,571
Thanks to you, they were able to close ranks
and throw me to the fucking wolves!

770
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:37,658
-Robbie! Look at me, look at me.
-Don't!

771
01:42:37,741 --> 01:42:41,370
Come back. Come back.

772
01:42:43,914 --> 01:42:46,166
Come back to me.

773
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:11,275
Briony.

774
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,862
There isn't much time.

775
01:43:16,113 --> 01:43:19,867
Robbie has to report for duty at 6:00,
and he's got a train to catch.

776
01:43:21,535 --> 01:43:22,870
So sit down.

777
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:31,545
There are some things
you're going to do for us.

778
01:43:48,353 --> 01:43:50,105
You'll go to your parents
as soon as you can,

779
01:43:50,189 --> 01:43:51,565
and you'll tell them everything
they need to know

780
01:43:51,648 --> 01:43:54,693
to be convinced
that the evidence you gave was false.

781
01:43:54,776 --> 01:43:56,445
You'll meet with a solicitor,
make a statement,

782
01:43:56,528 --> 01:43:58,697
have it signed, witnessed,
send copies to us. Is that clear?

783
01:43:58,780 --> 01:43:59,907
Yes.

784
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:02,826
You'll write a detailed letter to me
explaining everything that happened

785
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:04,912
leading up to you saying
you saw me by the lake.

786
01:44:04,995 --> 01:44:06,246
Try to include whatever you can remember

787
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:08,123
of what Danny Hardman was doing
that night.

788
01:44:08,207 --> 01:44:09,458
-Hardman?
-Yes.

789
01:44:12,669 --> 01:44:14,338
It wasn't Danny Hardman.

790
01:44:15,214 --> 01:44:17,216
It was Leon's friend, Marshall.

791
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:19,134
I don't believe you.

792
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:22,471
He's married Lola.
I've just come from their wedding.

793
01:44:28,477 --> 01:44:31,146
Lola won't be able to testify
against him now.

794
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:34,983
He's immune.

795
01:44:50,749 --> 01:44:55,504
I'm very, very sorry for the terrible distress
that I have caused.

796
01:44:57,506 --> 01:44:59,758
I am very, very sorry.

797
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,302
Just do as we've asked of you.

798
01:45:02,678 --> 01:45:07,141
Write it all down, just the truth, no rhymes.
No embellishments, no adjectives.

799
01:45:08,892 --> 01:45:10,644
And then leave us be.

800
01:45:12,563 --> 01:45:13,981
I will, I promise.

801
01:46:16,794 --> 01:46:19,004
I'm sorry.
Could we stop for a moment?

802
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:22,007
Of course. Is something the matter?

803
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:25,344
I just need a couple of minutes by myself.

804
01:46:27,721 --> 01:46:29,556
...minutes by myself.

805
01:46:30,974 --> 01:46:36,355
Briony Tallis, your new novel,
your twenty-first, is called Atonement. It's...

806
01:46:38,232 --> 01:46:39,316
Briony?

807
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:46,740
I'm sorry. Could we stop for a moment?

808
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:26,155
Briony Tallis, I'd like to talk now
about your new novel, Atonement,

809
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:29,825
which comes out in a few days
to coincide with your birthday.

810
01:47:30,409 --> 01:47:34,830
-It's your twenty-first novel...
-It's my last novel.

811
01:47:36,373 --> 01:47:38,959
Oh, really? Are you retiring?

812
01:47:40,169 --> 01:47:41,503
I'm dying.

813
01:47:43,714 --> 01:47:47,926
My doctor tells me
I have something called vascular dementia,

814
01:47:49,553 --> 01:47:52,639
which is essentially
a continuous series of tiny strokes.

815
01:47:52,723 --> 01:47:58,353
Your brain closes down, gradually
you lose words, you lose your memory,

816
01:47:58,437 --> 01:48:01,482
which for a writer is pretty much the point.

817
01:48:04,318 --> 01:48:08,947
So that's why I could finally write the book,
I think. I had to.

818
01:48:09,781 --> 01:48:12,117
And why, of course, it's my last novel.

819
01:48:15,329 --> 01:48:16,872
Strangely enough,

820
01:48:21,752 --> 01:48:26,089
it would be just as accurate
to call it my first novel.

821
01:48:27,257 --> 01:48:32,471
I wrote several drafts as far back as my time
at St Thomas' Hospital during the War.

822
01:48:33,263 --> 01:48:35,766
I just couldn't ever find the way to do it.

823
01:48:36,558 --> 01:48:39,019
Because the novel is autobiographical,
is that right?

824
01:48:39,102 --> 01:48:42,606
Yes, entirely. I haven't changed any names,
including my own.

825
01:48:42,689 --> 01:48:44,525
And was that the problem?

826
01:48:45,859 --> 01:48:46,985
No.

827
01:48:47,861 --> 01:48:52,616
I had, for a very long time,
decided to tell the absolute truth.

828
01:48:54,117 --> 01:48:56,286
No rhymes, no embellishments.

829
01:49:05,295 --> 01:49:06,630
And I think...

830
01:49:09,675 --> 01:49:12,302
You've read the book,
you'll understand why.

831
01:49:14,304 --> 01:49:18,559
I got first-hand accounts of all the events
I didn't personally witness,

832
01:49:19,184 --> 01:49:24,148
the conditions in prison,
the evacuation to Dunkirk, everything.

833
01:49:25,649 --> 01:49:28,861
But the effect of all this honesty
was rather pitiless.

834
01:49:28,944 --> 01:49:35,033
You see, I couldn't any longer imagine
what purpose would be served by it.

835
01:49:36,535 --> 01:49:39,121
By what? Sorry. Served by honesty?

836
01:49:39,204 --> 01:49:40,330
By honesty.

837
01:49:41,707 --> 01:49:43,041
Or reality.

838
01:49:48,505 --> 01:49:50,382
Because, in fact,

839
01:49:51,717 --> 01:49:56,430
I was too much of a coward
to go and see my sister in June, 1940.

840
01:49:58,223 --> 01:50:00,017
I never made that journey to Balham.

841
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,768
Do you have any idea
what it's like in jail?

842
01:50:01,852 --> 01:50:03,896
So the scene in which
I confess to them is imagined.

843
01:50:03,979 --> 01:50:05,105
He sleeps so deeply.

844
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:06,231
Invented.

845
01:50:06,315 --> 01:50:09,234
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

846
01:50:09,318 --> 01:50:11,778
And, in fact,
could never have happened.

847
01:50:11,862 --> 01:50:12,946
Because

848
01:50:15,365 --> 01:50:20,287
Robbie Turner died of septicaemia
at Bray-Dunes

849
01:50:21,413 --> 01:50:23,749
on June the first, 1940,

850
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:26,877
the last day of the evacuation.

851
01:50:31,757 --> 01:50:32,966
Cheerio, pal.

852
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:10,838
And I was never able to put things right
with my sister, Cecilia,

853
01:51:12,589 --> 01:51:17,177
because she was killed
on the 15th of October, 1940,

854
01:51:17,511 --> 01:51:21,849
by the bomb that destroyed the gas
and water mains above Balham tube station.

855
01:51:58,594 --> 01:51:59,678
So...

856
01:52:02,222 --> 01:52:05,934
My sister and Robbie were never able
to have the time together

857
01:52:07,519 --> 01:52:11,648
they both so longed for, and deserved.

858
01:52:13,442 --> 01:52:16,320
And which, ever since, I've...

859
01:52:21,408 --> 01:52:25,662
Ever since I've always felt I prevented.

860
01:52:32,252 --> 01:52:35,380
But what sense of hope,

861
01:52:36,965 --> 01:52:41,428
or satisfaction, could a reader derive
from an ending like that?

862
01:52:42,262 --> 01:52:48,811
So, in the book, I wanted to give Robbie
and Cecilia what they lost out on in life.

863
01:52:50,187 --> 01:52:55,442
I'd like to think
this isn't weakness or evasion,

864
01:52:58,070 --> 01:53:00,197
but a final act of kindness.

865
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:08,747
I gave them their happiness.

866
01:59:59,316 --> 02:00:00,359
