1
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:57,375
<i>Before time began, there was the Cube.</i>

2
00:00:57,914 --> 00:01:00,041
<i>We know not where it comes from,</i>

3
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:06,386
<i>only that it holds the power</i>
<i>to create worlds and fill them with life.</i>

4
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,984
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

5
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,561
<i>For a time, we lived in harmony,</i>

6
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:19,226
<i>but like all great power,</i>
<i>some wanted it for good, others for evil.</i>

7
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:22,467
<i>And so began the war,</i>

8
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:27,600
<i>a war that ravaged our planet</i>
<i>until it was consumed by death,</i>

9
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:32,843
<i>and the Cube was lost</i>
<i>to the far reaches of space.</i>

10
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:39,250
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,</i>
<i>hoping to find it and rebuild our home,</i>

11
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:43,850
<i>searching every star, every world.</i>

12
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:50,333
<i>And just when all hope seemed lost,</i>
<i>message of a new discovery drew us</i>

13
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:54,870
<i>to an unknown planet called Earth.</i>

14
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:04,145
<i>But we were already too late.</i>

15
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,685
Oh, God, five months of this.

16
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:22,287
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

17
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,424
A plate of mama's alligators <i>étouffée.</i>

18
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,695
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets

19
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:29,966
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

20
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:33,372
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.

21
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:34,534
I understand.

22
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,411
English, please. English.

23
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,213
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,515
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.

25
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,553
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

26
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,688
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

27
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,461
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.

28
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:02,528
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:05,670
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.

30
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,265
- He's adorable.
- That's too...

31
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:08,344
Shut up!

32
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:29,265
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

33
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,259
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.

34
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:33,460
Hey, hey!

35
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:37,768
Watch this crossover, baby.

36
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:41,037
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.

37
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,039
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?

38
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:46,411
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:49,110
- Water?
- Thank you.

40
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:50,785
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:02,261
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

42
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:11,496
<i>Unidentified aircraft, you are</i>
<i>in restricted US military airspace.</i>

43
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:14,406
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.

44
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:20,343
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.

45
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,283
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.

46
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:32,927
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.

47
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:36,157
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

48
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:39,467
Copy the bogie.

49
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,129
<i>Tail 4500 X-ray.</i>

50
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,706
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.

51
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:46,638
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.

52
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:48,802
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.

53
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:50,880
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:55,481
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you</i>
<i>to US SOCCENT airbase.</i>

55
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,917
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.

56
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,155
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

57
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,158
- My ladies!
<i>- Look.</i>

58
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,263
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.

59
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:15,496
<i>Look at those cheeks.</i>
<i>I just wanna chew on them.</i>

60
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,329
<i>Baby, we made a good-looking kid.</i>

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,567
I know that people say that all the time,

62
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:22,042
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.

63
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:23,908
She has your laugh.

64
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:26,607
<i>- She laughed?</i>
- Her first one, yeah.

65
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:29,651
<i>You sure she didn't just fart?</i>

66
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:31,549
No, she's a lady.

67
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:34,145
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

68
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:38,560
4500 X. Something's not right.

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,295
<i>Bogie's on the deck.</i>

70
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:48,532
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

71
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,904
It's coming from the chopper.

72
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,572
<i>- Will?</i>
- Sarah?

73
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:58,081
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

74
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:58,513
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

75
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:04,212
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.

76
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:11,288
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

77
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:17,655
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

78
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:29,509
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

79
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:37,745
My God.

80
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:58,033
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!

81
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:28,234
Go! Move! Move!

82
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:36,873
It's going after the files!

83
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:38,344
Cut the hard lines!

84
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,382
I need a key! It's locked!

85
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,912
Move! Move!

86
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:51,625
Here, come here! Come here!

87
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:08,671
Here, hide in here!

88
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:10,876
Oh, my God. Okay.

89
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:13,537
No!

90
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:16,318
Oh!

91
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:28,126
What the...

92
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:38,837
Epps, let's go!

93
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:01,293
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

94
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:04,030
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

95
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,327
Watch.

96
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:06,435
Okay.

97
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,132
For my family...

98
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:13,675
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.

99
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:17,946
Okay.

100
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,073
So, for my family genealogy report,

101
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:24,312
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,

102
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:27,656
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

103
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,148
Very famous explorer.

104
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:35,686
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

105
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:42,994
<i>In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors</i>
<i>straight into the Arctic Shelf.</i>

106
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,104
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

107
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:53,613
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

108
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:58,546
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

109
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:01,054
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

110
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,254
So that's the story, right?

111
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,555
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

112
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:08,493
used by 19th-century seamen.

113
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,800
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.

114
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,198
It's all for sale, by the way.

115
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:18,001
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.

116
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,573
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

117
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:23,406
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.

118
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:25,743
Are you going to sell me his liver?

119
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:28,442
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.

120
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:29,643
I don't think your grandfather would be

121
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:30,980
particularly proud of what you're doing.

122
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:34,318
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.

123
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:36,482
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.

124
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:37,923
Cold hard cash works, too.

125
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:40,325
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

126
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:41,760
- Sam!
- Sorry.

127
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:43,693
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,

128
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:48,634
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

129
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:49,898
drawing these strange symbols

130
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:52,474
and babbling on about
some giant ice man

131
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,236
that he thought he'd discovered.

132
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:58,177
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.

133
00:10:58,281 --> 00:11:00,579
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

134
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:03,015
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

135
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,679
Okay. Pretty good, right?

136
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:10,024
I'd say a solid B-.

137
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:12,716
A B-?

138
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:14,853
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap

139
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:16,124
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...

140
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:17,460
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?

141
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,899
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?

142
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:21,560
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.

143
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:24,299
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.

144
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:26,170
And a man's promise to that boy.

145
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:29,108
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

146
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:31,475
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."

147
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,708
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

148
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:37,877
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.

149
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:42,781
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

150
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:45,523
Yes! Yes, yes.

151
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:48,030
So?

152
00:11:48,364 --> 00:11:49,331
A-. It's an A, though.

153
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:51,195
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

154
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,995
- So I'm good?
- You're good.

155
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:57,000
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...

156
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,331
Yeah, a little surprise.

157
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:03,971
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

158
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:06,437
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?

159
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:09,484
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.

160
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:14,849
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.

161
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:16,424
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you

162
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:19,187
a Porsche for your first car?

163
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,490
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.

164
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:25,089
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

165
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:29,705
- Manny!
- What?

166
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,267
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

167
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,467
He's having a heat stroke again.

168
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:34,634
Scaring white folks.

169
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:36,644
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.

170
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:40,074
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,

171
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:41,740
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

172
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:44,216
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.

173
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,787
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

174
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:47,219
- You ever see <i>40-Year-Old Virgin?</i>
- Yeah.

175
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:50,417
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.

176
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:52,289
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

177
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:54,590
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

178
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:55,959
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.

179
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:57,123
Gentlemen.

180
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,000
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.

181
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:03,196
How can I help you?

182
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:06,069
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.

183
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:09,069
- You come to see me?
- I had to.

184
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:13,547
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

185
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,015
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.

186
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:20,980
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.

187
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:25,090
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.

188
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:27,122
The car'll pick the driver.

189
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:30,027
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

190
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:33,033
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

191
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:37,663
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

192
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:42,434
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

193
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,604
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

194
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:52,243
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.

195
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:53,787
This ain't bad.

196
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:57,116
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:58,557
It got racing...

198
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:01,060
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?

199
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:02,926
I don't know nothing about this car.

200
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:04,260
- Manny!
- What?

201
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:06,960
What is this? This car! Check it out!

202
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:09,560
I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's <i>loco!</i>

203
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:12,163
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!

204
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:13,798
Feels good.

205
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,373
- How much?
- Well,

206
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:23,343
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,

207
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,249
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

208
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:29,415
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.

209
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:30,549
It's custom faded?

210
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:33,423
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

211
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,327
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

212
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:38,324
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

213
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:39,992
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.

214
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:43,299
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

215
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:46,568
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

216
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:48,802
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.

217
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:51,505
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

218
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,639
This is a classic engine right here.

219
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:56,081
I sold a car the other day...

220
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,553
Gee. Holy cow.

221
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:01,088
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?

222
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,956
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

223
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,721
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers

224
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:08,956
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

225
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:10,999
<i>... greater than man...</i>

226
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,194
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.

227
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:32,420
$4,000.

228
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,226
Steve.

229
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:48,235
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

230
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,831
They're so young.

231
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:54,068
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.

232
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:56,440
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.

233
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:59,912
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

234
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,013
I am so underdressed.

235
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:06,110
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.

236
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,651
Please be seated.

237
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,688
I'm John Keller.

238
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:16,060
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.

239
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,333
<i>At 1900 local time yesterday,</i>

240
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:22,632
<i>the SOCCENT Forward Operations</i>
<i>Base in Qatar was attacked.</i>

241
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:26,103
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

242
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:29,808
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.

243
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,039
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,

244
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:35,583
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,

245
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:39,552
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

246
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:42,958
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

247
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:47,051
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.

248
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:56,330
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

249
00:16:57,806 --> 00:17:00,900
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it

250
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,477
and intercept further communications,

251
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,376
but we need your help
to find out who did this.

252
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:09,679
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.

253
00:17:10,152 --> 00:17:12,382
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

254
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,082
The President has dispatched
battle groups

255
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,354
<i>to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.</i>
<i>This is as real as it's ever gonna get.</i>

256
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:21,088
<i>Now I'm gonna leave you</i>
<i>to your officer-in-charge.</i>

257
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:24,097
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.

258
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,723
Good luck to us all.

259
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:38,613
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.

260
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:44,312
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.

261
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:45,544
Zero bids.

262
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:49,320
Great. Broke.

263
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:51,791
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?

264
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:55,093
No. Premature.

265
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:56,528
Good. What's up?

266
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:59,465
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.

267
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:02,964
It's like clockwork.

268
00:18:03,072 --> 00:18:04,664
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,

269
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:07,833
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?

270
00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:10,241
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

271
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:14,442
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.

272
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,744
This one is wobbly.

273
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:19,947
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?

274
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,181
- Sam...
- What?

275
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,850
I do not like footprints on my grass.

276
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,154
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.

277
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:27,956
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?

278
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:30,190
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,

279
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,392
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.

280
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:34,594
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?

281
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:36,864
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.

282
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:38,530
That's his bling.

283
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:40,841
I want you home at 11:00!

284
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:42,808
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!

285
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:45,038
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

286
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,375
Seat belt on!

287
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:56,348
Wow. You are so cheap.

288
00:18:57,626 --> 00:19:00,459
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.

289
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:10,863
<i>At this time, we can't confirm</i>
<i>whether there were any survivors.</i>

290
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:12,374
Oh, my God.

291
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:14,305
<i>Our bases worldwide are, as of now,</i>
<i>at DEFCON Delta,</i>

292
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,537
<i>our highest readiness level.</i>

293
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:19,575
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system

294
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:22,047
that we have not come across before.

295
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:25,186
<i>But our prayers are with the families</i>
<i>of the brave men and women...</i>

296
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,116
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

297
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:30,949
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.

298
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:33,922
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton

299
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:37,123
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.

300
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,529
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields

301
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:41,796
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

302
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:43,201
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?

303
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,464
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

304
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:48,543
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

305
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:52,607
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.

306
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:55,212
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers

307
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:56,909
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

308
00:19:57,086 --> 00:20:01,386
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

309
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,354
It looked right at me.

310
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:08,360
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.

311
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:09,897
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.

312
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:11,329
<i>My radio's fried.</i>

313
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:14,428
<i>- I got no communication with aerial.</i>
<i>- Hey, Mahfouz.</i>

314
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:17,505
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.

315
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:19,130
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.

316
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:20,902
All right, let's hit it.

317
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,678
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

318
00:20:26,782 --> 00:20:30,650
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.

319
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:33,580
Oh, my God.

320
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:37,219
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?

321
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:38,884
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.

322
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:39,961
Okay.

323
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,630
Hey, guys, check it out.

324
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:48,103
Oh, hi.

325
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:52,299
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

326
00:20:57,446 --> 00:20:59,505
So, what are you guys doing here?

327
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,115
We're here to climb this tree.

328
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,716
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

329
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,287
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.

330
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:09,357
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?

331
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:12,223
Let's go call your mom.

332
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:16,229
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.

333
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:19,027
I was researching a book I was writing.

334
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:20,431
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

335
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:22,902
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

336
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:28,035
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

337
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:30,373
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.

338
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:33,642
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,

339
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:36,309
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.

340
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:38,112
That's funny.

341
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:40,914
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

342
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,989
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.

343
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:48,153
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...

344
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,857
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.

345
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,994
What are you doing?

346
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:55,160
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.

347
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,704
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.

348
00:21:57,806 --> 00:22:01,071
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

349
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:04,145
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.

350
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:07,238
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

351
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:11,584
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

352
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:14,189
Okay.

353
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:17,090
You'll call me.

354
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:26,399
<i>Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?</i>

355
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,991
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?

356
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:30,003
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?

357
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:32,733
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.

358
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:34,468
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

359
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:35,838
You got to be understanding
here, all right?

360
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:37,343
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.

361
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:39,073
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.

362
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:40,978
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.

363
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,414
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?

364
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:43,711
Bros before hos.

365
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:45,582
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?

366
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:46,676
You can't do this to me.

367
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,881
You got to get out of my car right now.

368
00:22:52,728 --> 00:22:56,164
<i>Who's gonna come around</i>
<i>when you break?</i>

369
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:59,132
Mikaela! It's Sam.

370
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:00,258
Witwicky.

371
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:02,930
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.

372
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:04,005
You sure?

373
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:05,869
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.

374
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:09,432
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.

375
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,673
There you go.

376
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,787
So...

377
00:23:23,692 --> 00:23:26,058
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

378
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:30,124
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

379
00:23:30,232 --> 00:23:32,257
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.

380
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:37,600
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.

381
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:40,698
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,

382
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:44,336
for tight abs and really big arms.

383
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:46,007
Big arms?

384
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:50,747
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.

385
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:53,343
Like, I just put in that light there.

386
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:57,881
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

387
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:00,762
Yeah.

388
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,400
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?

389
00:24:07,502 --> 00:24:09,333
Oh, no, no.

390
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:11,338
We've been in the same school
since first grade.

391
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,737
- Really?
- Yeah.

392
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:14,472
Yeah, a long time.

393
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:16,476
Well, do we have any classes together?

394
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:18,136
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?

395
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:21,738
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

396
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,112
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.

397
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:26,654
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.

398
00:24:26,755 --> 00:24:28,416
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...

399
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:30,218
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.

400
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:32,759
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.

401
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:36,760
No, no, no. No. Come on.

402
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:40,567
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.

403
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:44,130
<i>When I get that feeling</i>
<i>I want sexual healing</i>

404
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:46,969
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...

405
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:48,770
<i>Sexual healing</i>

406
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:51,107
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...

407
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:54,182
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

408
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:56,682
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

409
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:58,480
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.

410
00:24:58,587 --> 00:24:59,918
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.

411
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:02,353
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.

412
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:05,517
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.

413
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:07,121
<i>I feel good</i>

414
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:08,628
Just pop the hood.

415
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:12,260
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

416
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:15,931
Whoa, nice headers.

417
00:25:16,037 --> 00:25:17,595
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.

418
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:20,106
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

419
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,436
Double-pump?

420
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:24,239
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.

421
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:28,009
I like to go faster.

422
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:32,050
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.

423
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:34,983
Yeah? How'd you know that?

424
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:40,117
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.

425
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:43,664
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

426
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:45,960
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

427
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:47,056
Oh, my God.

428
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:48,727
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

429
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:51,863
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.

430
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:54,601
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

431
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:57,576
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.

432
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,237
I prefer it, actually.

433
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:02,213
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

434
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:04,512
- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.

435
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:08,055
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

436
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:12,918
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.

437
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:14,689
Good luck with your car.

438
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:18,156
All right.

439
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:20,200
Walking's healthy, right?

440
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:23,564
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

441
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:26,236
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.

442
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:29,174
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.

443
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:33,745
<i>Baby come back</i>
<i>any kind of fool could see</i>

444
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:35,109
Hey!

445
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:40,146
<i>There was something</i>
<i>in everything about you</i>

446
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:44,348
<i>Baby come back</i>
<i>you can blame it all on me</i>

447
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:45,790
Hey!

448
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:50,057
Wait a second!

449
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:53,690
<i>I was wrong</i>
<i>and I just can't live without you</i>

450
00:26:55,303 --> 00:26:56,861
There it is.

451
00:26:57,506 --> 00:27:01,340
I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.

452
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,074
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?

453
00:27:07,315 --> 00:27:10,375
I think you're... No, no, no.

454
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:15,085
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.

455
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:18,025
Okay.

456
00:27:19,027 --> 00:27:19,994
Yeah.

457
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:22,620
All right, I'll see you at school.

458
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:23,789
All right.

459
00:27:29,704 --> 00:27:31,171
That's stupid.

460
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:32,530
That was a stupid line.

461
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:35,439
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.

462
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:39,211
Oh, God.

463
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:42,207
Oh, my God. I love my car.

464
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:58,757
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.

465
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:02,530
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

466
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:06,403
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?

467
00:28:06,942 --> 00:28:09,103
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.

468
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:14,612
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

469
00:28:14,716 --> 00:28:16,775
<i>We will hunt down this enemy.</i>
<i>And when we do,</i>

470
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:19,080
<i>we'll know just what to do with them.</i>

471
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:21,783
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:40,199
<i>Apparently, there are</i>
<i>very few survivors.</i>

473
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:41,502
Yes, Mr. President?

474
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,545
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?

475
00:28:56,691 --> 00:29:00,752
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

476
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:27,088
Shoot.

477
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:42,793
Gross.

478
00:30:09,998 --> 00:30:11,659
Do you hear that?

479
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:16,194
Are you getting this?

480
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:18,832
I think they're hacking
the network again.

481
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:37,183
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

482
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:39,123
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

483
00:30:39,227 --> 00:30:41,218
- Yes, you should.
- So I am.

484
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,638
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!

485
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:56,267
We need a senior analyst.

486
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:58,242
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

487
00:30:58,346 --> 00:31:00,871
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus

488
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:04,179
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

489
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:05,809
Code Red. We have a breach.

490
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,650
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.

491
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:11,521
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

492
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:17,530
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?

493
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:20,760
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?

494
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:23,565
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.

495
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:27,664
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

496
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,094
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.

497
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:53,666
What the...

498
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,540
<i>Shots fired in the underdeck.</i>
<i>Repeat, shots fired.</i>

499
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:04,476
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency descent.</i>

500
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:24,555
I want our President in that bunker.

501
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:28,693
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.

502
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:31,897
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.

503
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:33,132
Air Force One is on the ground.

504
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:39,867
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

505
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,266
That's my car!

506
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:45,042
No!

507
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:48,273
No, no, no, no.

508
00:33:55,823 --> 00:33:57,916
Dad, call the cops!

509
00:33:59,694 --> 00:34:02,822
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?

510
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:06,662
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!

511
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:10,226
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.

512
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:13,136
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?

513
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:15,903
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!

514
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:50,101
Oh, my God.

515
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:07,926
My name is Sam Witwicky.

516
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:11,965
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?

517
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,796
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

518
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:17,268
and if you find <i>Busty Beauties</i>
under my bed, it wasn't mine.

519
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:19,363
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...

520
00:35:19,474 --> 00:35:22,102
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

521
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,178
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

522
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:37,984
No! No! No! No!

523
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:42,894
Oh, my God.

524
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:45,989
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!

525
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,292
Oh, my God.

526
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:55,304
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!

527
00:35:58,212 --> 00:35:59,577
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

528
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,013
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!

529
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:07,253
Listen, listen, listen.

530
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:08,686
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!

531
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,348
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.

532
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,518
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.

533
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:17,192
Put your head on the hood.

534
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:33,208
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,

535
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:35,839
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

536
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,577
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.

537
00:36:37,685 --> 00:36:40,813
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.

538
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,550
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

539
00:36:43,658 --> 00:36:45,649
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,

540
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,285
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.

541
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:49,454
It's become the system.

542
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:52,727
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.

543
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,426
The only countries
with this kind of capability

544
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:56,833
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

545
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:59,873
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.

546
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:02,204
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?

547
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,141
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

548
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:07,373
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

549
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:10,512
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,

550
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:13,246
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

551
00:37:13,354 --> 00:37:16,016
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

552
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:17,853
would take 20 years to do that.

553
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:20,427
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery

554
00:37:20,528 --> 00:37:22,860
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

555
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:26,456
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?

556
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:29,934
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.

557
00:37:30,037 --> 00:37:32,301
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers

558
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:34,601
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

559
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:37,041
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

560
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:39,636
What about an organism?
A living organism?

561
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:42,147
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

562
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,913
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.

563
00:37:46,387 --> 00:37:48,947
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

564
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:51,388
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,

565
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:53,983
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter

566
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:58,031
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?

567
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:06,940
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.

568
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:10,208
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.

569
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,441
Wow. That's really neat.

570
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:15,676
Okay, chiefie.

571
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,847
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

572
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:20,752
What are you rolling?

573
00:38:20,855 --> 00:38:23,187
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?

574
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:25,657
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?

575
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,258
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

576
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:33,125
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?

577
00:38:33,234 --> 00:38:36,863
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

578
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:42,103
What was that?

579
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:46,941
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

580
00:38:48,115 --> 00:38:51,573
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.

581
00:38:51,686 --> 00:38:54,883
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

582
00:38:56,257 --> 00:38:57,519
Are you on drugs?

583
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,330
Let's hope this telephone line works.

584
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:13,339
Hey, heads up!

585
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:17,070
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

586
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:23,984
What the heck was that?

587
00:39:28,656 --> 00:39:30,988
English, dude. English.

588
00:39:37,398 --> 00:39:38,524
Whoa!

589
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,690
Watch out!

590
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:49,442
- Open fire!
- Contact! Contact!

591
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:50,601
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

592
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:52,838
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

593
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:03,352
Get up! Get up! Come on!

594
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:12,261
Go! Move it!

595
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:26,672
Take cover!

596
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,041
Fig! Cover the rear!

597
00:40:31,686 --> 00:40:36,589
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

598
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:39,717
Come on! Give me a mag!

599
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:42,553
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?

600
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:43,755
Papa!

601
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:46,628
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

602
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:49,100
- Telephone, telephone, yes!
- Telephone!

603
00:40:49,203 --> 00:40:50,795
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

604
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:52,167
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.

605
00:40:52,273 --> 00:40:53,240
Fire!

606
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:57,035
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?

607
00:40:57,144 --> 00:40:59,635
It's an emergency Pentagon...

608
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,642
I don't have a credit card!

609
00:41:04,118 --> 00:41:07,849
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.

610
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:10,651
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.

611
00:41:10,758 --> 00:41:15,058
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!

612
00:41:16,397 --> 00:41:17,694
Ammo!

613
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:20,427
I need a credit card!

614
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:25,167
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!

615
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,536
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

616
00:41:28,642 --> 00:41:32,840
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

617
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:35,842
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

618
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,941
Okay, it's Visa.

619
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:39,447
Also, sir, have you heard about

620
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:41,646
our premium plus
world-service gold package?

621
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:46,887
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!

622
00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:51,159
Give me a status.

623
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:54,126
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

624
00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:55,930
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.

625
00:41:56,036 --> 00:41:57,003
Survivors?

626
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:02,502

to the nearest AWACS.

630

Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...

631
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:19,352
Predator ETA two minutes.

632
00:42:28,135 --> 00:42:30,069
Hey! Make way!

633
00:42:34,942 --> 00:42:37,001
- What is that?
- I don't know.

634
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:43,978

and we need it now.

659
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:51,736
- Fig? Fig?
- Oh, God!

660
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:54,510
- God damn it!
- Get a medic!

661
00:44:54,615 --> 00:44:55,707
Get a medic!

662
00:44:55,883 --> 00:44:56,907
- I'm sorry.
- Black Hawk...

663
00:44:57,017 --> 00:44:58,211
We'll get a medic. Just hold on.
He's got a pulse.

664
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,184
We need a medevac. One man down.
Patient care category urgent.

665
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:07,621
Bring them home.

666
00:45:09,029 --> 00:45:11,395
<i>You get those men stateside right now.</i>

667
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:13,594
<i>I want them debriefed in 10 hours.</i>

668
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:23,742
There's only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.

669
00:45:34,188 --> 00:45:36,884
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!

670
00:45:39,994 --> 00:45:41,689
I am sorry to bother you.

671
00:45:41,996 --> 00:45:43,623
- Maggie?
- Listen, I need your help.

672
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:47,724
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.

673
00:45:47,835 --> 00:45:49,496
- Listen to me.
- Glen! Who is it?

674
00:45:49,603 --> 00:45:51,730
Shut up, Grandma!

675
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,273
- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?

676
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,468
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

677
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:03,973
- What level are you on, man?
- Six.

678
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,482
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!

679
00:46:13,093 --> 00:46:15,926
Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?

680
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,861
Yeah. Get low.

681
00:46:18,198 --> 00:46:22,134
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

682
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:24,067
Hey. I need a moment.

683
00:46:25,072 --> 00:46:26,403
- Please.
- Sorry.

684
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:28,566
Hey, man, save my game.

685
00:46:28,676 --> 00:46:30,541
How classified?

686
00:46:31,879 --> 00:46:35,940
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.

687
00:46:36,216 --> 00:46:38,184
Yes! One quick peek.

688
00:46:38,986 --> 00:46:42,149
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

689
00:46:42,256 --> 00:46:44,781
- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

690
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:46,450
The rangers are en route
with the imager,

691
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,460
but we also have a security issue.

692
00:46:48,562 --> 00:46:50,826
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy

693
00:46:50,931 --> 00:46:52,592
of the network intrusion signal.

694
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:58,901
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?

695
00:46:59,006 --> 00:47:01,338
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency

696
00:47:01,442 --> 00:47:03,000
in less than a minute.

697
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,305
- No way.
- Yeah.

698
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,217
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.

699
00:47:17,357 --> 00:47:18,915
"Project Iceman"?

700
00:47:19,026 --> 00:47:22,427
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?

701
00:47:23,964 --> 00:47:26,296
Are you playing
those video games again?

702
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,491
Cops! Cops!

703
00:47:28,602 --> 00:47:31,298
FBI! Clear right!

704
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:35,234
Lock it down! Lock it down!

705
00:47:36,944 --> 00:47:37,911
Cops!

706
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:39,338
Lock it down.

707
00:47:39,446 --> 00:47:42,938
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

708
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:47,612
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!

709
00:47:47,721 --> 00:47:49,348
Especially police!

710
00:47:49,957 --> 00:47:52,721
<i>It was an awesome spectacle here</i>
<i>an hour ago</i>

711
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:56,694
<i>when over 40 C-17 s lifted off</i>
<i>of this very base.</i>

712
00:47:57,331 --> 00:47:59,356
<i>We're not told where they're going.</i>

713
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:00,455
Morning, Mo.

714
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:02,865
<i>The government has been very quiet</i>
<i>about what's going on but in our...</i>

715
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,597
- Mojo. Mojo.
<i>- They were headed directly</i>

716
00:48:04,705 --> 00:48:06,229
<i>towards North Korea.</i>

717
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,207
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?

718
00:48:12,813 --> 00:48:14,576
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

719
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:17,707
- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?

720
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:20,719
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.

721
00:48:28,595 --> 00:48:29,619
Stop!

722
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:31,459
No, no, no, no, no, no.

723
00:48:37,971 --> 00:48:39,097
Oh, my God!

724
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:40,907
Sam?

725
00:48:44,011 --> 00:48:44,978
Hi.

726
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:48,544
That was... That was really awesome.

727
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:50,742
- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?

728
00:48:50,851 --> 00:48:52,842
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.

729
00:48:52,953 --> 00:48:54,818
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.

730
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:57,152
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

731
00:49:30,057 --> 00:49:31,615
Oh, great. Cops.

732
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:37,924
Officer!

733
00:49:39,566 --> 00:49:41,329
Listen!

734
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:43,837
Oh, that hurt.

735
00:49:46,573 --> 00:49:48,063
Listen to me!

736
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:51,042
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!

737
00:49:51,144 --> 00:49:54,807
I've been... I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?

738
00:49:54,915 --> 00:49:57,509
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!

739
00:49:57,618 --> 00:50:04,080
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

740
00:50:04,424 --> 00:50:08,884
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

741
00:50:10,197 --> 00:50:14,065
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

742
00:50:18,238 --> 00:50:21,002
Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?

743
00:50:23,343 --> 00:50:24,742
Okay.

744
00:50:30,284 --> 00:50:31,751
Oh, God, no! No!

745
00:50:33,687 --> 00:50:39,125
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

746
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:43,925
It's a bad dream.

747
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:47,562
Are you username LadiesMan217?

748
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:48,828
I don't know what you're talking about!

749
00:50:48,936 --> 00:50:51,302
Are you username LadiesMan217?

750
00:50:51,405 --> 00:50:52,531
Yeah.

751
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:55,073
Where is eBay item 21153?

752
00:50:55,175 --> 00:50:56,870
Where are the glasses?

753
00:51:08,455 --> 00:51:09,717
Get back!

754
00:51:10,624 --> 00:51:11,591
Stop!

755
00:51:14,728 --> 00:51:15,695
God!

756
00:51:16,596 --> 00:51:18,359
What is your problem, Sam?

757
00:51:18,465 --> 00:51:20,456
Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!

758
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:25,004
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

759
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:33,703
Sam, what is that thing?

760
00:51:33,814 --> 00:51:35,179
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.

761
00:51:35,282 --> 00:51:37,375
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.

762
00:51:37,484 --> 00:51:41,853
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

763
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:54,798
Go, go, go, go!

764
00:51:59,406 --> 00:52:01,203
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

765
00:52:01,308 --> 00:52:02,866
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

766
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:05,274
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

767
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:07,311
Oh, my God! No!

768
00:52:07,414 --> 00:52:08,711
We're gonna die!

769
00:52:14,755 --> 00:52:16,120
Oh, my God!

770
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,666
We're locked in.

771
00:52:37,177 --> 00:52:40,613
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?

772
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,612
Okay.

773
00:52:49,222 --> 00:52:50,655
Time to start.

774
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:56,318
He's got me! Oh, God!

775
00:54:02,863 --> 00:54:04,728
He's going to kill me!

776
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:09,529
No. No, no, no!

777
00:54:24,117 --> 00:54:25,311
Get off!

778
00:54:39,966 --> 00:54:40,990
Kill it! Kill it!

779
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:42,659
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

780
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:51,477
Not so tough without a head, are you?

781
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:58,883
Here, come on.

782
00:55:13,733 --> 00:55:15,200
What is it?

783
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:18,036
It's a robot.

784
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:20,736
But like a...

785
00:55:20,874 --> 00:55:24,366
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.

786
00:55:25,745 --> 00:55:27,178
It's probably Japanese.

787
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,680
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

788
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:32,979
What are you doing?

789
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,783
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.

790
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:39,188
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

791
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:42,693
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.

792
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:47,227
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?

793
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:49,825
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

794
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:53,468
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.

795
00:55:53,974 --> 00:55:56,135
- Can you talk?
<i>- XM Satellite Radio...</i>

796
00:55:56,243 --> 00:55:59,804
<i>Digital cable brings you...</i>
<i>... Columbia Broadcasting System...</i>

797
00:55:59,913 --> 00:56:01,676
So you... You talk through the radio?

798
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:04,682
<i>Thank you, you're beautiful.</i>
<i>You're wonderful, you're wonderful.</i>

799
00:56:04,784 --> 00:56:06,775
So, what was that last night?
What was that?

800
00:56:06,886 --> 00:56:08,353
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain...</i>

801
00:56:08,455 --> 00:56:10,514
<i>Throughout the inanimate vastness</i>
<i>of space...</i>

802
00:56:10,624 --> 00:56:12,592
<i>Angels will rain down</i>
<i>like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!</i>

803
00:56:12,692 --> 00:56:14,819
Visitors from heaven? What...

804
00:56:14,928 --> 00:56:17,055
What are you,
like, an alien or something?

805
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:25,360
<i>Any more questions you want to ask?</i>

806
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:28,200
He wants us to get in the car.

807
00:56:29,242 --> 00:56:30,709
And go where?

808
00:56:31,711 --> 00:56:33,474
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,

809
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:36,673
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?

810
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:07,875
This car's a pretty good driver.

811
00:57:07,981 --> 00:57:09,141
I know.

812
00:57:11,818 --> 00:57:13,786
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

813
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,081
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.

814
00:57:16,189 --> 00:57:17,247
Yeah.

815
00:57:18,692 --> 00:57:20,159
You're right.

816
00:57:21,695 --> 00:57:24,664
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?

817
00:57:25,832 --> 00:57:29,598
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.

818
00:57:31,671 --> 00:57:33,070
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?

819
00:57:33,173 --> 00:57:34,731
- Yeah.
- Okay.

820
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,201
There, see? That's better.

821
00:57:39,512 --> 00:57:40,911
- Okay.
- Okay.

822
00:57:44,617 --> 00:57:47,984
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.

823
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,022
Thank you.

824
00:57:51,091 --> 00:57:53,218
You know what I don't understand?

825
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:56,386
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,

826
00:57:56,496 --> 00:57:59,090
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

827
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:01,830
Whoa! Whoa!

828
00:58:01,935 --> 00:58:04,699
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?

829
00:58:04,804 --> 00:58:05,862
Move it, you moron!

830
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:07,997
Great, now... See?

831
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:10,535
Fantastic.

832
00:58:10,643 --> 00:58:12,508
Now you pissed him off.

833
00:58:12,812 --> 00:58:14,279
That car is sensitive.

834
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:16,576
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

835
00:58:29,729 --> 00:58:30,821
What?

836
00:59:34,594 --> 00:59:35,959
This is you...

837
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,000
Oh, my God!

838
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:51,938
Come on, let's go.

839
00:59:56,850 --> 01:00:00,047
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!

840
01:00:00,153 --> 01:00:03,611
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than <i>Armageddon.</i> I swear to God!

841
01:00:03,756 --> 01:00:05,951
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

842
01:00:19,939 --> 01:00:21,566
Whoa! Sweet!

843
01:00:21,674 --> 01:00:23,801
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,

844
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,172
'cause he is so boned!

845
01:00:29,082 --> 01:00:30,413
What is that?

846
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,542
There's something in the tree, dude.

847
01:00:32,652 --> 01:00:34,779
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!

848
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:36,219
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?

849
01:01:11,624 --> 01:01:14,115
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

850
01:01:15,395 --> 01:01:18,728
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

851
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:21,322
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

852
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:58,058
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

853
01:02:59,232 --> 01:03:00,700
They know your name.

854
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:00,995
They know your name.

855
01:03:01,934 --> 01:03:02,901
Yeah.

856
01:03:03,002 --> 01:03:05,436
My name is Optimus Prime.

857
01:03:05,538 --> 01:03:09,599
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

858
01:03:09,709 --> 01:03:13,076
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.

859
01:03:13,279 --> 01:03:18,546
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

860
01:03:18,651 --> 01:03:22,178
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

861
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:24,620
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?

862
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:28,319
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

863
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:32,297
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

864
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:36,760
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.

865
01:03:36,869 --> 01:03:40,100
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

866
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,501
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

867
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:47,739
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.

868
01:03:50,149 --> 01:03:53,482
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.

869
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,381
Bumblebee, right?

870
01:03:55,488 --> 01:03:57,183
<i>Check on the rep</i>
<i>Yep, second to none</i>

871
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,656
So you're my guardian, huh?

872
01:03:59,759 --> 01:04:04,958
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.

873
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,167
Why are you here?

874
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:16,503
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.

875
01:04:16,843 --> 01:04:18,276
Mega-what?

876
01:04:27,854 --> 01:04:33,451
<i>Our planet was once a powerful empire,</i>
<i>peaceful and just,</i>

877
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:39,362
<i>until we were betrayed by Megatron,</i>
<i>leader of the Decepticons.</i>

878
01:04:40,466 --> 01:04:43,731
<i>All who defied them were destroyed.</i>

879
01:04:43,836 --> 01:04:49,934
<i>Our war finally consumed the planet,</i>
<i>and the All Spark was lost to the stars.</i>

880
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:56,906
<i>Megatron followed it to Earth,</i>
<i>where Captain Witwicky found him.</i>

881
01:04:58,084 --> 01:04:59,779
My grandfather.

882
01:04:59,886 --> 01:05:04,084
<i>It was an accident</i>
<i>that intertwined our fates.</i>

883
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:08,851
Come back!

884
01:05:11,397 --> 01:05:13,957
I think the dogs have found something.

885
01:05:15,034 --> 01:05:16,797
The ice is cracking!

886
01:05:26,179 --> 01:05:29,205
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

887
01:05:29,949 --> 01:05:31,940
I'm all right, lads!

888
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,747
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

889
01:05:43,129 --> 01:05:48,226
<i>Megatron crash-landed</i>
<i>before he could retrieve the Cube.</i>

890
01:05:51,804 --> 01:05:55,262
Men! We've made a discovery!

891
01:05:55,374 --> 01:05:59,777
<i>He accidentally activated</i>
<i>his navigation system.</i>

892
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:19,195
<i>The coordinates to the Cube's location</i>
<i>on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.</i>

893
01:06:19,298 --> 01:06:21,323
How'd you know about his glasses?

894
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:23,664
- EBay.
- EBay.

895
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:26,932
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

896
01:06:27,073 --> 01:06:32,875
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.

897
01:06:32,979 --> 01:06:36,380
And the human race
will be extinguished.

898
01:06:36,482 --> 01:06:41,943
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.

899
01:06:45,157 --> 01:06:48,126
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.

900
01:06:52,064 --> 01:06:55,500
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.

901
01:06:55,601 --> 01:06:57,592
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.

902
01:06:57,703 --> 01:06:58,965
Melted right through.

903
01:06:59,071 --> 01:07:02,268
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

904
01:07:02,408 --> 01:07:04,603
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

905
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,905
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.

906
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,305
- Heads up!
- Oh!

907
01:07:10,049 --> 01:07:12,711
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

908
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,850
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.

909
01:07:16,956 --> 01:07:18,287
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.

910
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:20,655
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.

911
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,227
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.

912
01:07:27,454 --> 01:07:29,149
You want that piece?

913
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:32,555
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.

914
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,719
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.

915
01:07:34,828 --> 01:07:38,161
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.

916
01:07:38,265 --> 01:07:40,825
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

917
01:07:40,934 --> 01:07:43,402
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

918
01:07:43,504 --> 01:07:47,338
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?

919
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:48,601
It's me and you.

920
01:07:48,709 --> 01:07:51,542
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

921
01:08:05,592 --> 01:08:08,618
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?

922
01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:10,356
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,

923
01:08:10,464 --> 01:08:12,455
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.

924
01:08:12,566 --> 01:08:13,533
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.

925
01:08:13,634 --> 01:08:15,864
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!

926
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:20,668
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

927
01:08:20,774 --> 01:08:21,741
Okay, so what?

928
01:08:21,842 --> 01:08:23,935
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.

929
01:08:24,044 --> 01:08:25,739
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

930
01:08:25,846 --> 01:08:26,813
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!

931
01:08:26,914 --> 01:08:30,748
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

932
01:08:33,053 --> 01:08:35,146
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.

933
01:08:35,255 --> 01:08:36,847
See? So can I go home now?

934
01:08:36,957 --> 01:08:39,187
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.

935
01:08:39,293 --> 01:08:42,990
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?

936
01:08:43,097 --> 01:08:45,429
It was something about
someone named Witwicky

937
01:08:45,532 --> 01:08:49,127
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.

938
01:08:49,236 --> 01:08:50,965
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

939
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,369
before you go to war
with the wrong country!

940
01:08:53,474 --> 01:08:56,307
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky</i>
<i>ended up right behind...</i>

941
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,002
- What did he say?
- What?

942
01:08:58,112 --> 01:08:59,579
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

943
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,240
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.

944
01:09:02,349 --> 01:09:03,748
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

945
01:09:09,123 --> 01:09:10,954
<i>Still no official word as to</i>
<i>what happened. You can see...</i>

946
01:09:11,058 --> 01:09:12,252
<i>- Yeah!</i>
- Call Sam.

947
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:13,917
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.

948
01:09:14,027 --> 01:09:15,324
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

949
01:09:15,429 --> 01:09:17,954
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.

950
01:09:18,065 --> 01:09:19,692
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?

951
01:09:24,972 --> 01:09:26,405
I need you to stay here, all right?

952
01:09:26,507 --> 01:09:27,667
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.

953
01:09:27,775 --> 01:09:28,742
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.

954
01:09:28,842 --> 01:09:29,831
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

955
01:09:29,943 --> 01:09:30,910
Five minutes, all right?

956
01:09:31,612 --> 01:09:34,581
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

957
01:09:34,681 --> 01:09:36,649
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.

958
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,377
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?

959
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:40,783
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.

960
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:44,551
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.

961
01:09:44,658 --> 01:09:46,216
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?

962
01:09:46,326 --> 01:09:49,193
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

963
01:09:49,296 --> 01:09:51,856
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

964
01:09:51,965 --> 01:09:53,057
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

965
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:54,634
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

966
01:09:54,735 --> 01:09:56,202
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

967
01:09:56,303 --> 01:09:57,668
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...

968
01:09:57,771 --> 01:09:58,999
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

969
01:09:59,106 --> 01:10:01,006
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill

970
01:10:01,108 --> 01:10:04,976
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.

971
01:10:05,078 --> 01:10:07,444
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.

972
01:10:07,548 --> 01:10:08,515
The...

973
01:10:10,484 --> 01:10:12,952
I love you. God, I love you

974
01:10:13,053 --> 01:10:14,782
just so much right now.

975
01:10:14,888 --> 01:10:16,321
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.

976
01:10:16,423 --> 01:10:17,947
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?

977
01:10:18,058 --> 01:10:19,889
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,

978
01:10:19,993 --> 01:10:21,358
because you're such a swell guy.

979
01:10:21,462 --> 01:10:22,588
One more thing, huh?

980
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:25,756
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!

981
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,960
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

982
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:31,366
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.

983
01:10:31,472 --> 01:10:34,339
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

984
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:36,875
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...

985
01:10:36,977 --> 01:10:38,945
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?

986
01:10:39,046 --> 01:10:41,879
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

987
01:10:45,152 --> 01:10:47,143
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?

988
01:10:47,254 --> 01:10:51,247
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!

989
01:10:52,559 --> 01:10:54,925
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

990
01:10:55,529 --> 01:10:58,054
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

991
01:10:58,165 --> 01:11:00,929
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

992
01:11:01,034 --> 01:11:03,832
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...

993
01:11:03,937 --> 01:11:06,906
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.

994
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,201
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?

995
01:11:08,308 --> 01:11:10,469
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

996
01:11:10,577 --> 01:11:13,774
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

997
01:11:13,881 --> 01:11:16,577
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

998
01:11:18,085 --> 01:11:22,249
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!

999
01:11:22,356 --> 01:11:23,846
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.

1000
01:11:23,957 --> 01:11:25,515
That's all it is.

1001
01:11:25,626 --> 01:11:28,424
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.

1002
01:11:29,463 --> 01:11:30,828
Okay, okay.

1003
01:11:32,032 --> 01:11:34,660
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.

1004
01:11:37,871 --> 01:11:39,429
Autobots, recon.

1005
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:43,969
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1006
01:11:44,077 --> 01:11:45,840
Got some ice on his nose.

1007
01:11:45,946 --> 01:11:48,380
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1008
01:11:48,482 --> 01:11:49,847
You did not.

1009
01:11:51,118 --> 01:11:53,245
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

1010
01:11:53,987 --> 01:11:56,547
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1011
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:00,252
Come on, come on.

1012
01:12:05,065 --> 01:12:08,159
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.

1013
01:12:08,268 --> 01:12:10,862
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1014
01:12:10,971 --> 01:12:12,632
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.

1015
01:12:12,739 --> 01:12:14,730
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

1016
01:12:16,109 --> 01:12:18,100
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

1017
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:19,235
My glasses were in the bag.

1018
01:12:19,346 --> 01:12:21,177
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1019
01:12:21,281 --> 01:12:22,839
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1020
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:24,008
So what I think you should do is
you should...

1021
01:12:24,117 --> 01:12:26,312
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1022
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:29,355
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

1023
01:12:29,456 --> 01:12:31,890
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...

1024
01:12:31,992 --> 01:12:33,425
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...

1025
01:12:33,527 --> 01:12:34,494
- You just told me to look...
- I know,

1026
01:12:34,595 --> 01:12:35,960
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1027
01:12:36,063 --> 01:12:38,759
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1028
01:12:38,865 --> 01:12:40,799
I'm already stressed out enough.

1029
01:12:40,901 --> 01:12:42,391
Okay. What now?

1030
01:12:44,805 --> 01:12:48,241
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1031
01:12:48,342 --> 01:12:52,301
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1032
01:12:52,412 --> 01:12:53,401
Oh, God. Oh!

1033
01:12:53,513 --> 01:12:57,643
<i>Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed</i>
<i>right here and now it's gone.</i>

1034
01:12:57,751 --> 01:13:00,049
<i>My moped's under there, man!</i>
<i>Who's gonna pay for that?</i>

1035
01:13:01,521 --> 01:13:03,250
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1036
01:13:03,357 --> 01:13:06,292
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...

1037
01:13:06,393 --> 01:13:07,985
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1038
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,153
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.

1039
01:13:09,262 --> 01:13:10,490
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1040
01:13:10,597 --> 01:13:12,588
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1041
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:14,166
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1042
01:13:14,267 --> 01:13:15,825
We must have the glasses.

1043
01:13:15,936 --> 01:13:17,494
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.

1044
01:13:17,604 --> 01:13:19,834
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

1045
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,032
Keep searching.

1046
01:13:21,141 --> 01:13:22,802
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1047
01:13:22,909 --> 01:13:24,137
Ten minutes. Okay?

1048
01:13:24,244 --> 01:13:26,007
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.

1049
01:13:26,113 --> 01:13:28,104
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1050
01:13:28,215 --> 01:13:29,239
Calm down, calm down.

1051
01:13:29,349 --> 01:13:31,044
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.

1052
01:13:31,151 --> 01:13:33,813
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1053
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,785
Good? Good? Okay.

1054
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:37,049
- Move!
- Get away!

1055
01:13:37,157 --> 01:13:38,852
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?

1056
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:40,859
He wants us to be quiet.

1057
01:13:44,698 --> 01:13:48,498
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!

1058
01:13:48,602 --> 01:13:49,302
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1059
01:13:49,302 --> 01:13:52,465
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!

1060
01:13:52,572 --> 01:13:54,403
How did you get over there so fast?

1061
01:13:55,475 --> 01:13:57,238
Wow! That was tingly!

1062
01:13:57,878 --> 01:14:00,745
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.

1063
01:14:05,619 --> 01:14:07,610
- Sam?
- Sammy?

1064
01:14:10,023 --> 01:14:12,719
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1065
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,289
- Sam?
- That's weird.

1066
01:14:15,429 --> 01:14:17,124
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.

1067
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,790
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1068
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:20,958
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.

1069
01:14:21,068 --> 01:14:22,968
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1070
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,230
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?

1071
01:14:24,337 --> 01:14:25,395
How come the door's locked?

1072
01:14:25,505 --> 01:14:29,134
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!

1073
01:14:29,242 --> 01:14:30,436
You know he'll start counting

1074
01:14:30,544 --> 01:14:31,943
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...

1075
01:14:32,045 --> 01:14:33,034
Oh, dear.

1076
01:14:33,146 --> 01:14:34,875
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!

1077
01:14:35,015 --> 01:14:36,380
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.

1078
01:14:36,483 --> 01:14:37,450
- Oh, my.
- Two.

1079
01:14:37,551 --> 01:14:39,610
- He's counting.
- Stand back.

1080
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,783
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?

1081
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:46,882
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1082
01:14:46,993 --> 01:14:48,585
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1083
01:14:48,695 --> 01:14:50,925
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...

1084
01:14:51,031 --> 01:14:52,896
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?

1085
01:14:52,999 --> 01:14:54,796
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1086
01:14:54,901 --> 01:14:56,391
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.

1087
01:14:56,503 --> 01:14:57,765
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.

1088
01:14:57,871 --> 01:14:59,896
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1089
01:15:00,006 --> 01:15:01,371
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.

1090
01:15:01,508 --> 01:15:02,497
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.

1091
01:15:02,609 --> 01:15:03,974
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.

1092
01:15:04,077 --> 01:15:05,544
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.

1093
01:15:05,645 --> 01:15:07,078
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1094
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,546
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1095
01:15:09,649 --> 01:15:14,109
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?

1096
01:15:15,989 --> 01:15:17,047
- Judy.
- Was I...

1097
01:15:17,157 --> 01:15:18,124
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?

1098
01:15:18,225 --> 01:15:19,556
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!

1099
01:15:19,659 --> 01:15:20,683
That's not something for you
to bring up.

1100
01:15:20,794 --> 01:15:22,318
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.

1101
01:15:22,429 --> 01:15:25,262
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1102
01:15:25,365 --> 01:15:28,994
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1103
01:15:29,102 --> 01:15:31,093
- Happy time?
...my special alone time...

1104
01:15:31,204 --> 01:15:32,171
- Stop.
- Mom.

1105
01:15:32,272 --> 01:15:33,261
- Judy, stop.
...with myself.

1106
01:15:33,373 --> 01:15:34,397
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.

1107
01:15:34,508 --> 01:15:36,806
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.

1108
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,935
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1109
01:15:39,045 --> 01:15:40,808
Oh, parents.

1110
01:15:41,715 --> 01:15:44,513
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1111
01:15:45,652 --> 01:15:49,213
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1112
01:15:49,322 --> 01:15:51,591
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1113
01:15:51,591 --> 01:15:51,955
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!

1114
01:15:52,058 --> 01:15:53,047
Oh, I hate these.

1115
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,422
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.

1116
01:15:54,528 --> 01:15:55,552
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?

1117
01:15:55,662 --> 01:15:57,186
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.

1118
01:15:57,297 --> 01:15:58,628
Can't you take safety seriously?

1119
01:15:58,732 --> 01:16:01,997
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1120
01:16:02,102 --> 01:16:05,003
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.

1121
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:13,602
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!

1122
01:16:13,713 --> 01:16:16,204
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!

1123
01:16:16,316 --> 01:16:18,546
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1124
01:16:18,652 --> 01:16:20,347
Trashed. Gone.

1125
01:16:20,654 --> 01:16:22,121
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.

1126
01:16:22,222 --> 01:16:24,247
The parents are very irritating.

1127
01:16:24,357 --> 01:16:26,052
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?

1128
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,889
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.

1129
01:16:28,995 --> 01:16:30,189
What is with you?

1130
01:16:30,297 --> 01:16:33,630
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1131
01:16:33,733 --> 01:16:35,394
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.

1132
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:37,902
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...

1133
01:16:38,004 --> 01:16:39,801
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1134
01:16:40,574 --> 01:16:42,838
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1135
01:16:44,311 --> 01:16:47,041
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1136
01:16:47,147 --> 01:16:50,014
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.

1137
01:16:50,116 --> 01:16:53,176
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...

1138
01:16:53,286 --> 01:16:54,776
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?

1139
01:16:54,888 --> 01:16:56,048
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1140
01:17:13,406 --> 01:17:16,739
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1141
01:17:16,843 --> 01:17:18,834
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.

1142
01:17:18,945 --> 01:17:19,912
I want you to distract my parents

1143
01:17:20,013 --> 01:17:22,311
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?

1144
01:17:28,255 --> 01:17:30,815
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1145
01:17:30,924 --> 01:17:32,949
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1146
01:17:33,059 --> 01:17:35,186
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1147
01:17:35,295 --> 01:17:37,820
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1148
01:17:37,931 --> 01:17:39,057
It's Witwicky.

1149
01:17:39,165 --> 01:17:42,396
May I enter the premises, sir?

1150
01:17:42,502 --> 01:17:45,437
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1151
01:17:45,538 --> 01:17:46,505
What the heck is going on here?

1152
01:17:46,606 --> 01:17:48,733
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.

1153
01:17:48,842 --> 01:17:51,106
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.

1154
01:17:51,211 --> 01:17:52,644
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?

1155
01:17:52,746 --> 01:17:53,804
That's right. National security.

1156
01:17:53,914 --> 01:17:55,506
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1157
01:17:55,615 --> 01:17:57,981
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!

1158
01:17:58,084 --> 01:17:59,881
Could you stay off the grass?

1159
01:17:59,986 --> 01:18:01,419
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.

1160
01:18:01,521 --> 01:18:03,148
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!

1161
01:18:03,256 --> 01:18:06,487
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!

1162
01:18:06,593 --> 01:18:08,060
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1163
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:09,492
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1164
01:18:09,596 --> 01:18:10,927
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden

1165
01:18:11,031 --> 01:18:13,192
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1166
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,326
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1167
01:18:16,436 --> 01:18:18,495
- No!
- What is this?

1168
01:18:18,605 --> 01:18:21,335
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?

1169
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:22,908
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.

1170
01:18:23,009 --> 01:18:24,237
Whoa, way out of line.

1171
01:18:24,344 --> 01:18:28,371
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1172
01:18:28,481 --> 01:18:30,381
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1173
01:18:30,483 --> 01:18:31,541
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1174
01:18:31,651 --> 01:18:32,845
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1175
01:18:32,953 --> 01:18:35,148
because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1176
01:18:35,255 --> 01:18:37,951
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,

1177
01:18:38,058 --> 01:18:42,017
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.

1178
01:18:42,128 --> 01:18:44,358
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1179
01:18:44,464 --> 01:18:47,024
I think direct contact.

1180
01:18:52,472 --> 01:18:54,030
- Son?
- Yeah.

1181
01:18:55,108 --> 01:18:58,009
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?

1182
01:19:03,783 --> 01:19:05,250
Fourteen rads.

1183
01:19:06,853 --> 01:19:08,320
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1184
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,955
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1185
01:19:11,057 --> 01:19:12,752
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!

1186
01:19:12,859 --> 01:19:14,383
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1187
01:19:14,494 --> 01:19:16,359
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1188
01:19:20,633 --> 01:19:21,793
So,

1189
01:19:23,236 --> 01:19:26,694
LadiesMan217.

1190
01:19:26,806 --> 01:19:30,242
That is your eBay username, right?

1191
01:19:30,343 --> 01:19:32,675
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.

1192
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:33,746
What do you make of this?

1193
01:19:33,847 --> 01:19:36,407
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?</i>
<i>And my...</i>

1194
01:19:36,516 --> 01:19:37,642
Is that you?

1195
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:39,946
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1196
01:19:40,053 --> 01:19:44,888
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.

1197
01:19:46,226 --> 01:19:48,558
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?

1198
01:19:48,661 --> 01:19:53,121
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...

1199
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:55,360
- Really?
...from me, from my home,

1200
01:19:55,468 --> 01:19:58,437
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!

1201
01:19:58,538 --> 01:20:00,267
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

1202
01:20:00,373 --> 01:20:03,809
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.

1203
01:20:06,946 --> 01:20:08,538
That's funny. That is so funny.

1204
01:20:08,648 --> 01:20:11,139
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?

1205
01:20:12,318 --> 01:20:15,082
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, <i>E. T.?</i> No.

1206
01:20:15,188 --> 01:20:16,678
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.

1207
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:17,916
You see this?

1208
01:20:18,024 --> 01:20:20,618
This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1209
01:20:20,727 --> 01:20:23,491
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1210
01:20:23,596 --> 01:20:24,824
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.

1211
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:27,331
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.

1212
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:30,494
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1213
01:20:30,603 --> 01:20:32,696
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.

1214
01:20:32,806 --> 01:20:34,205
What? Parole?

1215
01:20:34,307 --> 01:20:37,640
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1216
01:20:37,744 --> 01:20:39,735
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?

1217
01:20:39,846 --> 01:20:41,575
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1218
01:20:41,681 --> 01:20:42,773
You stole cars?

1219
01:20:42,882 --> 01:20:44,577
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,

1220
01:20:44,684 --> 01:20:46,481
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1221
01:20:46,586 --> 01:20:48,884
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!

1222
01:20:48,988 --> 01:20:51,616
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1223
01:20:52,759 --> 01:20:57,389
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.

1224
01:20:57,497 --> 01:20:59,795
It is time to talk!

1225
01:21:06,539 --> 01:21:07,972
Big! It's big!

1226
01:21:12,712 --> 01:21:14,680
Go, go, go, go!

1227
01:21:15,115 --> 01:21:17,743
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!

1228
01:21:17,851 --> 01:21:19,284
All right! All right!

1229
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:36,165
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1230
01:21:36,269 --> 01:21:42,799
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1231
01:21:45,044 --> 01:21:48,810
Taking the children was a bad move.

1232
01:21:48,915 --> 01:21:52,316
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1233
01:21:55,922 --> 01:21:57,651
Freeze!

1234
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,690
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!

1235
01:21:59,792 --> 01:22:00,850
Whoa!

1236
01:22:02,295 --> 01:22:03,353
Whoa!

1237
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:15,471
Hi, there.

1238
01:22:15,775 --> 01:22:20,508
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1239
01:22:21,214 --> 01:22:26,151
Look, there are
S-Seven protocols, okay?

1240
01:22:26,753 --> 01:22:28,050
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you

1241
01:22:28,154 --> 01:22:30,384
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.

1242
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:33,084
- Get out of the car.
- All right.

1243
01:22:33,726 --> 01:22:34,852
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!

1244
01:22:34,961 --> 01:22:36,451
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1245
01:22:36,563 --> 01:22:39,930
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?

1246
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:43,525
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1247
01:22:43,636 --> 01:22:45,160
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?

1248
01:22:45,271 --> 01:22:46,260
How you doing?

1249
01:22:46,372 --> 01:22:48,101
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?

1250
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:50,369
- Yeah.
- This is real.

1251
01:22:50,476 --> 01:22:53,639
Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?

1252
01:22:53,746 --> 01:22:57,512
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1253
01:22:58,117 --> 01:23:02,281
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1254
01:23:03,856 --> 01:23:05,517
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1255
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:08,492
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1256
01:23:08,595 --> 01:23:11,086
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!

1257
01:23:11,197 --> 01:23:13,427
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1258
01:23:13,533 --> 01:23:15,524
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?

1259
01:23:15,635 --> 01:23:17,500
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1260
01:23:17,604 --> 01:23:19,333
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1261
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:22,272
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.

1262
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:25,572
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1263
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:31,817
Hey!

1264
01:23:31,918 --> 01:23:34,853
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1265
01:23:34,954 --> 01:23:37,013
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1266
01:23:38,358 --> 01:23:41,657
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

1267
01:23:41,761 --> 01:23:44,457
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

1268
01:23:45,698 --> 01:23:47,529
For threatening my dad.

1269
01:23:50,603 --> 01:23:56,508
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.

1270
01:23:58,278 --> 01:23:59,939
You're a criminal.

1271
01:24:00,613 --> 01:24:03,411
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1272
01:24:04,884 --> 01:24:07,717
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.

1273
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:08,809
All right.

1274
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:11,014
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1275
01:24:13,059 --> 01:24:14,959
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.

1276
01:24:15,094 --> 01:24:17,255
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1277
01:24:17,363 --> 01:24:18,625
- Enjoy.
- Okay?

1278
01:24:18,731 --> 01:24:23,168
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.

1279
01:24:29,709 --> 01:24:31,643
Optimus! Incoming!

1280
01:24:39,352 --> 01:24:40,580
Roll out.

1281
01:24:47,493 --> 01:24:50,826
<i>Okay, I'm picking up rad readings</i>
<i>under that bridge right down there.</i>

1282
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:57,101
<i>Okay, I'm getting really good rad</i>
<i>readings. Forty-two and higher.</i>

1283
01:24:57,203 --> 01:24:58,534
Up you get.

1284
01:25:03,242 --> 01:25:05,210
<i>Okay, we're dropping in.</i>

1285
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:11,842
<i>Really strong readings right down</i>
<i>below us. There he is.</i>

1286
01:25:11,951 --> 01:25:14,112
<i>Ship one and two, come on in.</i>

1287
01:25:15,188 --> 01:25:17,816
<i>That's it, right there.</i>
<i>Mark him, mark him.</i>

1288
01:25:17,924 --> 01:25:21,189
<i>Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.</i>
<i>Right off the nose.</i>

1289
01:25:21,728 --> 01:25:23,286
<i>I got it. 12:00.</i>

1290
01:25:27,367 --> 01:25:28,800
<i>Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.</i>

1291
01:25:31,771 --> 01:25:33,966
<i>Got him going down the street.</i>

1292
01:25:37,577 --> 01:25:42,139
<i>Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.</i>
<i>Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?</i>

1293
01:25:42,482 --> 01:25:44,643
<i>Okay, I lost him. I lost him.</i>

1294
01:25:45,218 --> 01:25:47,209
<i>Okay, we're coming around.</i>

1295
01:26:09,909 --> 01:26:11,433
Easy, you two.

1296
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:24,051
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1297
01:26:24,724 --> 01:26:27,716
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!

1298
01:26:28,961 --> 01:26:31,020
- Hold on!
- No!

1299
01:26:34,734 --> 01:26:35,962
Sam!

1300
01:26:41,574 --> 01:26:44,702
<i>All right, we've got him pinned.</i>
<i>We've got him pinned in the river.</i>

1301
01:26:44,811 --> 01:26:46,073
<i>I'm in for the shot.</i>

1302
01:26:46,179 --> 01:26:47,612
Stop! Stop!

1303
01:26:48,815 --> 01:26:50,612
Wait! No!

1304
01:26:53,986 --> 01:26:56,580
<i>- Take the shot, get him.</i>
<i>- Take the shot.</i>

1305
01:26:57,156 --> 01:26:58,350
No!

1306
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,533
No! Stop!

1307
01:27:17,143 --> 01:27:18,440
Stop!

1308
01:27:19,045 --> 01:27:22,481
<i>Get down on the ground! Get down!</i>
<i>Get down!</i>

1309
01:27:23,483 --> 01:27:24,814
What? Okay.

1310
01:27:26,686 --> 01:27:28,847
Look, he's not fighting back!

1311
01:27:29,455 --> 01:27:31,650
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1312
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:39,588
Stop hurting him!

1313
01:27:49,008 --> 01:27:50,703
Don't let him move!

1314
01:27:51,444 --> 01:27:53,002
I got him here!

1315
01:28:16,202 --> 01:28:17,260
No!

1316
01:28:21,274 --> 01:28:23,071
Happy to see me again?

1317
01:28:24,577 --> 01:28:27,307
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.

1318
01:28:33,185 --> 01:28:36,245
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1319
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:46,694
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1320
01:28:49,535 --> 01:28:50,934
Optimus,

1321
01:28:53,272 --> 01:28:55,740
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?

1322
01:28:55,841 --> 01:28:59,538
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1323
01:28:59,645 --> 01:29:02,443
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.

1324
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:16,826
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations

1325
01:29:16,929 --> 01:29:18,055
in the western Pacific.

1326
01:29:18,164 --> 01:29:20,359
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1327
01:29:20,466 --> 01:29:23,230
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.

1328
01:29:27,573 --> 01:29:30,440
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles

1329
01:29:30,543 --> 01:29:31,874
of cruise missile range.

1330
01:29:31,978 --> 01:29:35,505
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1331
01:29:35,615 --> 01:29:37,583
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?

1332
01:29:39,986 --> 01:29:45,049
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.

1333
01:29:45,157 --> 01:29:48,354
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.

1334
01:29:51,497 --> 01:29:53,988
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.

1335
01:29:57,637 --> 01:30:00,299
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1336
01:30:00,406 --> 01:30:02,806
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!

1337
01:30:02,908 --> 01:30:04,569
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1338
01:30:04,677 --> 01:30:07,111
- General?
- I'll take a seat.

1339
01:30:08,147 --> 01:30:09,114
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1340
01:30:09,215 --> 01:30:12,207
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.

1341
01:30:12,318 --> 01:30:13,410
The blackout's global.

1342
01:30:13,519 --> 01:30:16,352
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.

1343
01:30:16,455 --> 01:30:20,983
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?

1344
01:30:26,932 --> 01:30:31,232
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.

1345
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:35,605
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1346
01:30:38,678 --> 01:30:40,236
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1347
01:30:40,346 --> 01:30:42,439
you won't understand right away.

1348
01:30:42,548 --> 01:30:45,881
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government

1349
01:30:45,985 --> 01:30:49,386
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.

1350
01:30:50,256 --> 01:30:54,352
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1351
01:30:55,461 --> 01:30:59,727
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.

1352
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:02,599
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1353
01:31:03,202 --> 01:31:05,727
This was classified above top secret.

1354
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,348
<i>EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.</i>

1355
01:31:23,456 --> 01:31:26,084
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1356
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:29,452
This is the image from Mars.

1357
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:33,060
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1358
01:31:33,165 --> 01:31:34,928
from the base attack.

1359
01:31:35,701 --> 01:31:38,795
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,

1360
01:31:39,672 --> 01:31:42,436
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1361
01:31:42,842 --> 01:31:45,504
Are we talking about an invasion?

1362
01:31:45,611 --> 01:31:48,705
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1363
01:31:48,814 --> 01:31:52,147
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.

1364
01:31:52,251 --> 01:31:53,980
That's why the virus shut us down,

1365
01:31:54,086 --> 01:31:57,385
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,

1366
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:01,984
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.

1367
01:32:05,865 --> 01:32:08,197
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.

1368
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:11,701
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.

1369
01:32:11,804 --> 01:32:15,137
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!

1370
01:32:15,241 --> 01:32:18,210
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.

1371
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:31,685
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!

1372
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:32,758
Let's go!

1373
01:32:37,797 --> 01:32:39,287
She's in here.

1374
01:32:39,665 --> 01:32:41,326
What's going on?

1375
01:32:41,867 --> 01:32:43,698
You're coming with me.

1376
01:32:44,136 --> 01:32:46,832
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?

1377
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,171
Who's this?

1378
01:32:49,942 --> 01:32:53,036
- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.

1379
01:33:04,323 --> 01:33:06,814
- So...
- What'd they get you for?

1380
01:33:07,893 --> 01:33:12,159
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.

1381
01:33:12,264 --> 01:33:13,231
Wow.

1382
01:33:13,899 --> 01:33:15,025
Who knew?

1383
01:33:31,817 --> 01:33:33,717
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1384
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:47,260
Please, let this work.

1385
01:33:48,667 --> 01:33:50,567
Fire it up, Optimus.

1386
01:33:51,537 --> 01:33:53,027
The code.

1387
01:33:53,138 --> 01:33:58,542
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1388
01:34:00,346 --> 01:34:04,146
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.

1389
01:34:05,317 --> 01:34:07,080
They must know it's here, as well.

1390
01:34:07,186 --> 01:34:08,517
What about Bumblebee?

1391
01:34:08,621 --> 01:34:12,682
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!

1392
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:16,784
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.

1393
01:34:16,896 --> 01:34:21,128
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.

1394
01:34:21,233 --> 01:34:24,168
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?

1395
01:34:25,571 --> 01:34:28,938
<i>They're a primitive and violent race.</i>

1396
01:34:31,277 --> 01:34:33,268
Were we so different?

1397
01:34:34,179 --> 01:34:38,548
<i>They're a young species.</i>
<i>They have much to learn.</i>

1398
01:34:38,651 --> 01:34:41,449
<i>But I've seen goodness in them.</i>

1399
01:34:41,553 --> 01:34:45,717
<i>Freedom is the right of</i>
<i>all sentient beings.</i>

1400
01:34:45,824 --> 01:34:50,056
<i>You all know there's only one way</i>
<i>to end this war.</i>

1401
01:34:50,162 --> 01:34:52,858
<i>We must destroy the Cube.</i>

1402
01:34:53,666 --> 01:34:58,228
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1403
01:34:58,337 --> 01:34:59,668
That's suicide.

1404
01:34:59,772 --> 01:35:03,572
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.

1405
01:35:03,676 --> 01:35:08,136
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.

1406
01:35:08,247 --> 01:35:11,546
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.

1407
01:35:13,018 --> 01:35:15,714
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1408
01:35:15,821 --> 01:35:19,621
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!

1409
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:34,833
Team attention! Present arms!

1410
01:35:35,507 --> 01:35:39,739
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.

1411
01:35:39,845 --> 01:35:41,540
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?

1412
01:35:41,647 --> 01:35:43,774
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.

1413
01:35:43,882 --> 01:35:45,144
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.

1414
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:48,344
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1415
01:35:49,855 --> 01:35:51,083
Hey, kid.

1416
01:35:52,157 --> 01:35:54,819
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1417
01:35:55,361 --> 01:35:56,453
You must be hungry?

1418
01:35:56,562 --> 01:35:58,553
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

1419
01:35:58,664 --> 01:36:00,291
Where's my car?

1420
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:03,960
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1421
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:06,165
People can die here.

1422
01:36:06,538 --> 01:36:09,234
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.

1423
01:36:09,341 --> 01:36:10,535
Okay.

1424
01:36:10,642 --> 01:36:14,373
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.

1425
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:19,179
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1426
01:36:20,819 --> 01:36:23,788
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

1427
01:36:23,889 --> 01:36:25,186
Thank you.

1428
01:36:26,658 --> 01:36:28,387
The man's an extortionist.

1429
01:36:30,129 --> 01:36:31,460
All right, here's the situation.

1430
01:36:31,563 --> 01:36:33,963
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1431
01:36:34,066 --> 01:36:35,158
NBEs?

1432
01:36:35,267 --> 01:36:38,862
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1433
01:36:38,971 --> 01:36:42,600
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

1434
01:36:51,784 --> 01:36:52,351
Dear God. What is this?

1435
01:36:52,351 --> 01:36:53,613
Dear God. What is this?

1436
01:36:55,187 --> 01:36:58,452
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,

1437
01:36:58,557 --> 01:37:01,993
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.

1438
01:37:02,094 --> 01:37:06,087
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1439
01:37:06,198 --> 01:37:09,463
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.

1440
01:37:09,568 --> 01:37:11,968
We call him NBE One.

1441
01:37:12,071 --> 01:37:14,437
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,

1442
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,940
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

1443
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:20,041
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1444
01:37:20,145 --> 01:37:23,478
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1445
01:37:23,582 --> 01:37:27,040
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries

1446
01:37:27,152 --> 01:37:28,585
in the history of mankind.

1447
01:37:28,687 --> 01:37:31,622
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

1448
01:37:31,723 --> 01:37:38,561
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1449
01:37:38,664 --> 01:37:42,464
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1450
01:37:43,035 --> 01:37:45,663
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1451
01:37:45,771 --> 01:37:48,137
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

1452
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:52,233
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1453
01:37:52,344 --> 01:37:54,209
Well, you got one now.

1454
01:37:55,147 --> 01:37:57,547
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.

1455
01:37:57,649 --> 01:37:59,173
All Spark? What is that?

1456
01:37:59,284 --> 01:38:01,844
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1457
01:38:01,954 --> 01:38:06,721
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,

1458
01:38:06,825 --> 01:38:09,259
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube

1459
01:38:09,361 --> 01:38:12,455
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

1460
01:38:12,564 --> 01:38:14,088
That's their plan.

1461
01:38:14,199 --> 01:38:16,599
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.

1462
01:38:18,937 --> 01:38:21,201
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1463
01:38:22,641 --> 01:38:23,767
Follow me.

1464
01:38:27,412 --> 01:38:29,903
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1465
01:38:38,857 --> 01:38:42,418
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

1466
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:46,957
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1467
01:38:47,799 --> 01:38:51,667
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1468
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:53,294
as well as NBE One.

1469
01:38:53,405 --> 01:38:55,965
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.

1470
01:38:56,074 --> 01:38:58,440
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1471
01:38:58,544 --> 01:39:01,877
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone

1472
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:05,575
or any alien species on the outside.

1473
01:39:44,389 --> 01:39:48,189
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1474
01:39:48,827 --> 01:39:51,318
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1475
01:39:55,901 --> 01:39:58,768
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

1476
01:40:04,676 --> 01:40:06,337
Oh, wow.

1477
01:40:06,445 --> 01:40:08,470
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?

1478
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,774
Oh, no, man.

1479
01:40:09,915 --> 01:40:14,375
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1480
01:40:14,486 --> 01:40:17,421
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.

1481
01:40:18,957 --> 01:40:21,983
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1482
01:40:22,094 --> 01:40:23,527
I got a phone.

1483
01:40:26,732 --> 01:40:29,326
Nokias are real nasty.

1484
01:40:29,434 --> 01:40:33,871
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1485
01:40:34,673 --> 01:40:36,800
Nokia's from Finland.

1486
01:40:36,908 --> 01:40:41,470
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.

1487
01:40:44,249 --> 01:40:49,812
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.

1488
01:41:03,502 --> 01:41:06,801
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!

1489
01:41:06,905 --> 01:41:10,568
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1490
01:41:21,586 --> 01:41:23,451
He's breaking the box.

1491
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,566
Go! Go! Go!

1492
01:41:42,674 --> 01:41:43,766
Move!

1493
01:41:52,317 --> 01:41:54,945
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1494
01:41:55,721 --> 01:41:57,052
Banachek. What's going on?

1495
01:41:57,155 --> 01:41:58,986
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

1496
01:41:59,091 --> 01:42:00,149
- What?
<i>...and the backup generator</i>

1497
01:42:00,258 --> 01:42:02,226
<i>- is just not gonna cut it.</i>
- Do you have an arms room?

1498
01:42:08,633 --> 01:42:10,396
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1499
01:42:10,502 --> 01:42:11,901
I'll bring security to the...

1500
01:42:12,003 --> 01:42:14,528
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!

1501
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:16,231
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!

1502
01:42:16,341 --> 01:42:17,706
Let's go!

1503
01:42:17,809 --> 01:42:19,572
They're popping our generators!

1504
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:32,955
Megatron melting!

1505
01:42:33,592 --> 01:42:36,652
<i>16502. We're losing pressure.</i>

1506
01:42:36,762 --> 01:42:38,957
Stand by! Set!

1507
01:42:39,064 --> 01:42:41,123
<i>We're losing pressure!</i>

1508
01:42:41,233 --> 01:42:44,669
<i>The cryogenic system is failing!</i>
<i>We're losing NBE One!</i>

1509
01:42:49,408 --> 01:42:52,104
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!

1510
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:56,203
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1511
01:43:01,753 --> 01:43:04,381
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.

1512
01:43:04,489 --> 01:43:05,513
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.

1513
01:43:05,624 --> 01:43:07,558
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.

1514
01:43:07,659 --> 01:43:09,388
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!

1515
01:43:09,494 --> 01:43:10,756
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1516
01:43:10,862 --> 01:43:12,227
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?

1517
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:14,321
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.

1518
01:43:14,433 --> 01:43:16,162
Take him to his car!

1519
01:43:17,903 --> 01:43:19,097
Drop it.

1520
01:43:20,872 --> 01:43:22,533
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1521
01:43:23,809 --> 01:43:25,800
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1522
01:43:26,311 --> 01:43:28,040
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1523
01:43:28,146 --> 01:43:29,170
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1524
01:43:29,281 --> 01:43:31,476
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.

1525
01:43:31,583 --> 01:43:32,743
S-Seven don't exist.

1526
01:43:32,851 --> 01:43:34,614
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1527
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:37,984
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1528
01:43:40,592 --> 01:43:42,219
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

1529
01:43:42,327 --> 01:43:46,388
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.

1530
01:43:50,902 --> 01:43:52,870
All right. Okay.

1531
01:43:52,971 --> 01:43:57,601
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1532
01:44:01,046 --> 01:44:02,308
No, no!

1533
01:44:03,281 --> 01:44:05,943
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1534
01:44:06,051 --> 01:44:09,612
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!

1535
01:44:10,822 --> 01:44:12,221
Are you okay?

1536
01:44:14,092 --> 01:44:16,185
They didn't hurt you, right?

1537
01:44:24,936 --> 01:44:28,736
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.

1538
01:44:31,142 --> 01:44:33,235
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?

1539
01:44:33,345 --> 01:44:35,575
They're not gonna hurt you.

1540
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:39,207
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.

1541
01:44:39,317 --> 01:44:42,582
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.

1542
01:44:42,687 --> 01:44:44,177
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1543
01:45:06,244 --> 01:45:09,736
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.

1544
01:45:29,868 --> 01:45:31,199
Oh, my God.

1545
01:45:36,007 --> 01:45:37,406
<i>Message from Starfleet, Captain.</i>

1546
01:45:37,509 --> 01:45:38,908
<i>Let's get to it.</i>

1547
01:45:39,010 --> 01:45:42,036
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1548
01:45:42,147 --> 01:45:43,546
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1549
01:45:43,648 --> 01:45:44,945
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here

1550
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:46,449
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.

1551
01:45:46,551 --> 01:45:47,518
Good! Right.

1552
01:45:47,619 --> 01:45:50,349
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.

1553
01:45:50,455 --> 01:45:52,514
This place must have some kind
of radio link!

1554
01:45:52,624 --> 01:45:54,489
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.

1555
01:45:54,593 --> 01:45:57,187
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!

1556
01:45:57,295 --> 01:45:58,728
In the alien archive, sir!

1557
01:45:58,830 --> 01:46:00,821
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.

1558
01:46:00,932 --> 01:46:02,456
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!

1559
01:46:02,567 --> 01:46:05,001
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1560
01:46:05,103 --> 01:46:06,866
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1561
01:46:06,972 --> 01:46:08,599
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,

1562
01:46:08,707 --> 01:46:10,675
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1563
01:46:10,775 --> 01:46:12,299
Affirmative!

1564
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:16,244
<i>Warning! NBE One</i>
<i>cryo-containment failing.</i>

1565
01:46:17,248 --> 01:46:19,113
Check that backup system!

1566
01:46:19,217 --> 01:46:23,381
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1567
01:46:23,488 --> 01:46:24,978
Come on! Get out of here!

1568
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:26,614
Heads up! Look out!

1569
01:46:27,626 --> 01:46:30,026
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!

1570
01:46:30,128 --> 01:46:33,564
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!

1571
01:46:43,274 --> 01:46:46,334
I am Megatron!

1572
01:47:05,163 --> 01:47:06,562
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1573
01:47:06,665 --> 01:47:07,654
Well, put the seat belt on.

1574
01:47:07,766 --> 01:47:08,926
Pour it on him!

1575
01:47:22,681 --> 01:47:24,672
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1576
01:47:24,783 --> 01:47:27,183
Where is the Cube?

1577
01:47:27,285 --> 01:47:29,344
The humans have taken it.

1578
01:47:32,724 --> 01:47:36,592
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

1579
01:47:37,028 --> 01:47:38,495
Come on, Mags!

1580
01:47:39,597 --> 01:47:41,087
Over here, sir!

1581
01:47:43,435 --> 01:47:45,494
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1582
01:47:45,603 --> 01:47:48,037
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.

1583
01:47:49,941 --> 01:47:53,399
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?

1584
01:47:54,446 --> 01:47:55,435
Mikes?

1585
01:47:55,547 --> 01:47:56,809
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.

1586
01:47:56,915 --> 01:47:58,473
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1587
01:47:58,583 --> 01:48:00,107
Let's find them.

1588
01:48:00,218 --> 01:48:01,685
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?

1589
01:48:01,786 --> 01:48:03,947
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.

1590
01:48:04,055 --> 01:48:07,115
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?

1591
01:48:07,225 --> 01:48:08,522
- Glen?
- Huh?

1592
01:48:08,626 --> 01:48:12,118
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?

1593
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:13,219
What good is that?

1594
01:48:13,331 --> 01:48:15,731
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!

1595
01:48:15,834 --> 01:48:19,395
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.

1596
01:48:19,504 --> 01:48:21,335
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1597
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:34,642
There's Optimus.

1598
01:48:52,604 --> 01:48:54,071
Almost done.

1599
01:48:55,907 --> 01:48:57,807
What the hell was that?

1600
01:49:00,879 --> 01:49:02,574
Barricade the door!

1601
01:49:05,316 --> 01:49:07,682
- Get something.
- Watch out!

1602
01:49:07,786 --> 01:49:09,879
Six, five, four, six, three.

1603
01:49:14,559 --> 01:49:16,925
Here! Put some rounds in!

1604
01:49:19,798 --> 01:49:21,231
Master search.

1605
01:49:22,133 --> 01:49:24,124
I got it! We're transmitting!

1606
01:49:24,235 --> 01:49:25,361
Send exactly what I say!

1607
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:29,600
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1608
01:49:29,707 --> 01:49:33,734
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1609
01:49:33,845 --> 01:49:35,369
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1610
01:49:37,081 --> 01:49:38,105
What was that?

1611
01:49:38,216 --> 01:49:41,049
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...

1612
01:49:43,221 --> 01:49:45,416
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.

1613
01:50:10,148 --> 01:50:12,116
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

1614
01:50:12,217 --> 01:50:15,653
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.

1615
01:50:36,875 --> 01:50:37,864
Oh, my God.

1616
01:51:06,437 --> 01:51:07,768
Cool, Mom!

1617
01:51:33,665 --> 01:51:35,656
This is so not good.

1618
01:51:54,152 --> 01:51:56,017
He's behind the pillar!

1619
01:52:01,893 --> 01:52:04,987
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!

1620
01:52:08,132 --> 01:52:10,464
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1621
01:52:14,339 --> 01:52:16,307
Sucker, burn!

1622
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,411
Oh, shit!

1623
01:52:23,748 --> 01:52:25,773
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1624
01:52:26,985 --> 01:52:29,010
<i>Raptors, let's scramble,</i>
<i>scramble, scramble.</i>

1625
01:52:30,221 --> 01:52:32,485
<i>Strike and Dark Star roll call.</i>

1626
01:52:34,826 --> 01:52:36,293
<i>Looking out the right side.</i>

1627
01:52:37,195 --> 01:52:39,356
<i>Push to Kill Box One Alpha...</i>

1628
01:52:46,938 --> 01:52:50,499
- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1629
01:52:50,608 --> 01:52:52,803
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1630
01:52:53,344 --> 01:52:55,539
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?

1631
01:52:55,646 --> 01:52:57,944
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1632
01:52:58,349 --> 01:53:01,341
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.

1633
01:53:01,452 --> 01:53:04,387
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.

1634
01:53:04,489 --> 01:53:07,185
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1635
01:53:07,792 --> 01:53:09,384
F-22 at 12:00.

1636
01:53:09,494 --> 01:53:12,190
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1637
01:53:12,296 --> 01:53:14,161
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1638
01:53:16,667 --> 01:53:19,067
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1639
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:20,997
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1640
01:53:22,273 --> 01:53:23,433
<i>We have you visual.</i>

1641
01:53:25,109 --> 01:53:26,440
<i>Green smoke is the mark.</i>

1642
01:53:26,544 --> 01:53:30,002
<i>Provide air cover and vector</i>
<i>Black Hawks for extraction.</i>

1643
01:53:34,652 --> 01:53:36,620
It's Starscream!

1644
01:53:37,088 --> 01:53:38,749
Please tell me you copy.

1645
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:41,388
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1646
01:53:45,196 --> 01:53:47,164
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1647
01:53:47,265 --> 01:53:50,428
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

1648
01:53:50,535 --> 01:53:51,763
Incoming!

1649
01:54:16,861 --> 01:54:18,658
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1650
01:54:18,763 --> 01:54:20,230
Clear the area!

1651
01:54:26,037 --> 01:54:27,561
Oh, my God.

1652
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:31,306
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1653
01:54:31,742 --> 01:54:33,073
Your legs.

1654
01:54:34,645 --> 01:54:38,274
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?

1655
01:54:39,817 --> 01:54:42,251
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1656
01:54:43,821 --> 01:54:45,015
Ratchet!

1657
01:54:46,891 --> 01:54:48,358
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?

1658
01:54:48,459 --> 01:54:50,393
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!

1659
01:54:50,495 --> 01:54:52,861
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.

1660
01:54:52,964 --> 01:54:55,125
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1661
01:54:55,233 --> 01:54:58,031
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.

1662
01:54:59,303 --> 01:55:00,327
Come on!

1663
01:55:00,438 --> 01:55:02,565
<i>Army Black Hawk inbound</i>
<i>to your location. Over.</i>

1664
01:55:04,342 --> 01:55:06,469
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1665
01:55:06,577 --> 01:55:08,909
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1666
01:55:27,131 --> 01:55:28,564
Move out! Let's go!

1667
01:55:35,006 --> 01:55:36,701
Let's go! Move!

1668
01:55:43,314 --> 01:55:44,975
I'm not gonna leave you.

1669
01:56:24,088 --> 01:56:26,113
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1670
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:33,954
Oh, my God!

1671
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:48,444
Concentrate your fire!

1672
01:56:59,357 --> 01:57:00,551
Come on. Come on.

1673
01:57:03,127 --> 01:57:04,822
Megatron!

1674
01:57:09,533 --> 01:57:13,196
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1675
01:57:17,475 --> 01:57:19,067
Fall back!

1676
01:57:25,082 --> 01:57:27,277
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!

1677
01:57:27,385 --> 01:57:29,410
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1678
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,784
We need air cover down here now!

1679
01:57:37,795 --> 01:57:39,194
Sam, help me with this.

1680
01:57:43,367 --> 01:57:47,701
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.

1681
01:57:47,805 --> 01:57:49,898
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?

1682
01:57:50,007 --> 01:57:52,305
No! I want two!

1683
01:57:53,878 --> 01:57:55,277
What's going on?

1684
01:57:57,081 --> 01:57:59,709
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1685
01:58:00,584 --> 01:58:02,848
Oh, these things just don't die.

1686
01:58:06,424 --> 01:58:07,914
Oh, we're so dead.

1687
01:58:08,025 --> 01:58:10,357
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!

1688
01:58:10,661 --> 01:58:11,650
Where's the Cube?

1689
01:58:11,762 --> 01:58:12,729
- Right there.
- Okay.

1690
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:13,819
And take that and wrap it around

1691
01:58:13,931 --> 01:58:14,898
the base and then put it
around his neck.

1692
01:58:14,999 --> 01:58:17,661
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1693
01:58:19,103 --> 01:58:20,570
That building.

1694
01:58:24,342 --> 01:58:26,139
- Okay.
- What?

1695
01:58:26,243 --> 01:58:29,212
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.

1696
01:58:29,313 --> 01:58:31,577
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.

1697
01:58:31,682 --> 01:58:33,877
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.

1698
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:35,918
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!

1699
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:40,423
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1700
01:58:40,524 --> 01:58:42,754
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,

1701
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:44,919
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1702
01:58:45,062 --> 01:58:46,552
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

1703
01:58:46,664 --> 01:58:47,824
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving

1704
01:58:47,932 --> 01:58:50,628
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1705
01:58:52,103 --> 01:58:53,161
Army Black Hawk requested.

1706
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:55,795
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.

1707
01:58:55,906 --> 01:58:58,431
<i>Headed to rooftop marked by flare.</i>

1708
01:58:58,542 --> 01:59:01,636
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.

1709
01:59:03,247 --> 01:59:06,580
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!

1710
01:59:10,554 --> 01:59:14,684
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

1711
01:59:17,928 --> 01:59:20,556
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1712
01:59:20,664 --> 01:59:23,895
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!

1713
01:59:26,637 --> 01:59:28,730
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!

1714
01:59:35,179 --> 01:59:36,476
Watch out!

1715
01:59:42,086 --> 01:59:45,112
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

1716
01:59:45,222 --> 01:59:46,883
Get out of here now!

1717
02:00:14,752 --> 02:00:15,719
Megatron!

1718
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:16,987
Prime.

1719
02:00:42,947 --> 02:00:45,006
Humans don't deserve to live.

1720
02:00:45,115 --> 02:00:47,777
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1721
02:00:48,219 --> 02:00:50,585
Then you will die with them!

1722
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:58,660
Join them in extinction!

1723
02:01:17,882 --> 02:01:19,543
Keep moving, Sam!

1724
02:01:20,551 --> 02:01:21,916
Don't stop!

1725
02:01:37,935 --> 02:01:38,924
No!

1726
02:01:54,151 --> 02:01:56,244
Sam, get to the building!

1727
02:02:04,161 --> 02:02:06,288
Give me that Cube, boy!

1728
02:02:18,943 --> 02:02:21,036
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1729
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:45,857
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

1730
02:02:51,175 --> 02:02:54,303
I smell you, boy!

1731
02:03:06,523 --> 02:03:07,683
Maggot!

1732
02:03:26,710 --> 02:03:28,302
Oh, no!

1733
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:54,701
I'll drive! You shoot!

1734
02:04:15,659 --> 02:04:16,956
This isn't going well!

1735
02:04:17,061 --> 02:04:18,460
Shoot! Shoot!

1736
02:05:04,308 --> 02:05:05,536
Nice shot.

1737
02:05:05,642 --> 02:05:09,100
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!

1738
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:20,648
Hey!

1739
02:05:24,128 --> 02:05:27,564
Hey! I'm over here!

1740
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:41,605
We've got the boy.

1741
02:05:46,216 --> 02:05:47,649
Watch out!

1742
02:05:48,018 --> 02:05:49,212
Missile!

1743
02:05:59,696 --> 02:06:01,129
Hang on, Sam!

1744
02:06:09,873 --> 02:06:11,204
No! No!

1745
02:06:16,914 --> 02:06:21,942
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

1746
02:06:35,499 --> 02:06:36,966
Where do I go?

1747
02:06:38,302 --> 02:06:42,261
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.

1748
02:06:43,574 --> 02:06:45,201
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1749
02:06:49,379 --> 02:06:51,813
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1750
02:06:51,949 --> 02:06:54,747
Oh, so unwise.

1751
02:07:06,697 --> 02:07:08,187
I got you, boy.

1752
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,797
Hold on to the Cube!

1753
02:07:31,488 --> 02:07:34,355
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.

1754
02:07:39,363 --> 02:07:40,387
Sam?

1755
02:07:44,668 --> 02:07:47,899
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1756
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:50,106
No sacrifice,

1757
02:07:51,475 --> 02:07:54,535
- no victory.
- If I cannot defeat Megatron,

1758
02:07:54,878 --> 02:07:57,369
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1759
02:07:57,781 --> 02:08:00,978
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1760
02:08:01,451 --> 02:08:02,918
Get behind me.

1761
02:08:04,621 --> 02:08:07,181
It's you and me, Megatron.

1762
02:08:07,291 --> 02:08:10,226
No, it's just me, Prime.

1763
02:08:12,663 --> 02:08:17,794
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1764
02:08:23,206 --> 02:08:28,041
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!

1765
02:08:47,197 --> 02:08:49,597
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1766
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:52,168
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.

1767
02:08:52,269 --> 02:08:53,293
Hey.

1768
02:08:54,504 --> 02:08:56,665
Bring the rain. All right?

1769
02:08:57,074 --> 02:08:59,065
All right, let's kill these things.

1770
02:09:01,044 --> 02:09:02,602
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.

1771
02:09:02,713 --> 02:09:04,704
Armor's weak under the chest.

1772
02:09:14,791 --> 02:09:16,349
Target marked. Still waiting.

1773
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:18,485
<i>Time on target, 20 seconds.</i>

1774
02:09:25,435 --> 02:09:27,528
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1775
02:09:32,776 --> 02:09:34,209
Move out!

1776
02:09:37,447 --> 02:09:38,675
Incoming!

1777
02:09:47,224 --> 02:09:49,317
<i>Weapons armed. Status green.</i>

1778
02:10:07,978 --> 02:10:09,809
Run! Move!

1779
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:18,844
<i>Second wave's on approach.</i>

1780
02:10:22,359 --> 02:10:23,951
<i>What is that? Break off!</i>

1781
02:10:24,061 --> 02:10:26,529
<i>- Copy.</i>
<i>- It's either a massive amount of...</i>

1782
02:10:35,272 --> 02:10:37,433
<i>Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!</i>

1783
02:10:41,511 --> 02:10:43,604
<i>Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.</i>

1784
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:45,277
Take him out!

1785
02:10:59,496 --> 02:11:00,827
Two's down!

1786
02:11:10,273 --> 02:11:12,207
I'll kill you!

1787
02:11:12,309 --> 02:11:15,073
Mine! All Spark!

1788
02:11:16,046 --> 02:11:18,913
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1789
02:11:19,616 --> 02:11:20,640
Sam!

1790
02:11:21,518 --> 02:11:22,712
No, Sam!

1791
02:11:48,545 --> 02:11:49,705
Hold up.

1792
02:11:52,816 --> 02:11:55,785
You left me no choice, brother.

1793
02:12:05,395 --> 02:12:08,262
Sam, I owe you my life.

1794
02:12:09,399 --> 02:12:11,128
We are in your debt.

1795
02:12:30,654 --> 02:12:33,054
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1796
02:12:33,924 --> 02:12:35,221
Jazz.

1797
02:12:38,428 --> 02:12:40,623
We lost a great comrade

1798
02:12:41,965 --> 02:12:43,830
but gained new ones.

1799
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:46,398
Thank you, all of you.

1800
02:12:46,736 --> 02:12:49,102
You honor us with your bravery.

1801
02:12:50,140 --> 02:12:52,108
Permission to speak, sir?

1802
02:12:52,609 --> 02:12:55,476
Permission granted, old friend.

1803
02:12:55,579 --> 02:12:57,046
You speak now?

1804
02:12:57,981 --> 02:13:00,074
I wish to stay with the boy.

1805
02:13:00,951 --> 02:13:02,782
If that is his choice.

1806
02:13:07,724 --> 02:13:08,748
Yes.

1807
02:13:29,412 --> 02:13:34,145
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated

1808
02:13:34,684 --> 02:13:37,710
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.

1809
02:13:38,355 --> 02:13:41,654
<i>The Laurentian Abyss is</i>
<i>seven miles below sea level,</i>

1810
02:13:41,758 --> 02:13:43,851
<i>deepest place on our planet.</i>

1811
02:13:44,094 --> 02:13:47,621
<i>The massive depth and pressure there,</i>
<i>coupled with subfreezing temperatures,</i>

1812
02:13:47,731 --> 02:13:49,926
<i>would crush and entomb them,</i>

1813
02:13:51,735 --> 02:13:53,464
<i>leaving no evidence.</i>

1814
02:14:00,110 --> 02:14:04,513
<i>With the All Spark gone,</i>
<i>we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

1815
02:14:06,249 --> 02:14:08,843
<i>And fate has yielded its reward,</i>

1816
02:14:10,387 --> 02:14:13,288
<i>a new world to call home.</i>

1817
02:14:19,562 --> 02:14:23,760
<i>We live among its people now,</i>
<i>hiding in plain sight,</i>

1818
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:26,664
<i>but watching over them in secret,</i>

1819
02:14:26,903 --> 02:14:29,463
<i>waiting, protecting.</i>

1820
02:14:30,874 --> 02:14:33,900
<i>I have witnessed</i>
<i>their capacity for courage.</i>

1821
02:14:34,511 --> 02:14:37,503
<i>And though we are worlds apart,</i>

1822
02:14:37,614 --> 02:14:42,551
<i>like us, there's more to them</i>
<i>than meets the eye.</i>

1823
02:14:44,087 --> 02:14:46,578
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

1824
02:14:46,990 --> 02:14:50,357
<i>and I send this message</i>
<i>to any surviving Autobots</i>

1825
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:53,452
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

1826
02:14:54,497 --> 02:14:56,226
<i>We are here.</i>

1827
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,825
<i>We are waiting.</i>

1828
02:15:18,121 --> 02:15:23,149
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?

1829
02:15:26,162 --> 02:15:31,657
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien

1830
02:15:32,268 --> 02:15:34,168
- infestation...
- Yeah.

1831
02:15:34,537 --> 02:15:36,971
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.

1832
02:15:37,073 --> 02:15:38,734
The government would let us know.

1833
02:15:38,908 --> 02:15:40,500
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.

1834
02:15:40,610 --> 02:15:43,044
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,

1835
02:15:43,146 --> 02:15:44,773
because there's no secrets.

1836
02:15:44,881 --> 02:15:46,974
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1837
02:15:57,026 --> 02:16:00,325
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.
