1
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,996
<i>This is Samantha...</i>

2
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,358
<i>...my mother's pet goose.</i>

3
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,826
<i>Mama loves her...</i>

4
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:41,296
<i>...just like one of the family.</i>

5
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:43,835
<i>But I hate that bird.</i>

6
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:45,432
<i>And she hates me.</i>

7
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,871
<i>She's mean and sneaky.</i>

8
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:50,170
<i>And full of tricks.</i>

9
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,110
<i>It seems every First Day morning...</i>

10
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:55,379
<i>...when we're ready to go to Meeting...</i>

11
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:58,085
<i>...and I got on
my best Sunday clothes...</i>

12
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:24,105
Samantha!

13
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:14,553
Thee old hisser!

14
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:17,062
I'll blow thee up with a cannon!

15
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,267
Some day I'll drown thee,
thee old squawker!

16
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:26,133
Little Jess!
What is thee saying, child?

17
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,643
Samantha tried to bite my legs off.

18
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:31,005
Next time, I'll throw her down the well.

19
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,173
Here, Samantha.

20
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,044
See, Little Jess?

21
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,811
Speak to her kindly.
She'll not bite thee.

22
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,144
She's a pure pet, Samantha is.

23
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,550
She's a snake on stilts!

24
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:45,925
I'll put her on the chopping block
and chop her head off.

25
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:47,323
Hush, hush!

26
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:49,496
Let's have no more talk of killing.

27
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:54,427
Run upstairs now and fetch thy brother
and sister. We'll be late for Meeting.

28
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:10,586
Blackberry pie?

29
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:12,744
Yes, blackberry pie.

30
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,253
No need to stick thy finger in it
to find out. No dilly-dallying!

31
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,688
Go fetch Mattie and Josh.

32
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,221
Well...

33
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,297
...perhaps.

34
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,464
Well!

35
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:35,333
This afternoon?

36
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:42,640
All right!

37
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,982
What's thee talking to thyself for?

38
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:51,387
I'm not talking to myself.

39
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:53,458
Who's thee talking to then?

40
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,425
I don't see nobody.

41
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:57,691
Thee knows what happens
to eavesdroppers?

42
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:00,961
Their ears get long as a hound dog's!

43
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:04,772
Mama says to hurry.

44
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,770
I am, but I have to finish
my toilet-tee.

45
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:09,102
What's a toilet-tee?

46
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:12,313
Thee wouldn't know about it
because thee doesn't wash.

47
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,016
Please leave my boudoir.

48
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,919
"Please leave my boudoir. "

49
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:20,819
Does thee...

50
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,386
Does thee think I'm pretty?

51
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,931
Thee's not ugly.

52
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:40,072
I guess thee's pretty...

53
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,538
...for a girl.

54
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,004
Well, thank thee!

55
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:46,738
Thee's welcome.

56
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:00,759
Powie! I got Jeff Davis!

57
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,023
Powie! I got old Stonewall Jackson!

58
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:05,826
Powie! I got old Little Jess Birdwell!

59
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:09,805
Meet the real Stonewall Jackson...

60
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:12,167
...and thee won't feel so feisty.
Get up.

61
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:15,308
What would thee do
if thee met Old Stonewall?

62
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:17,445
Mama said not to talk about the war.

63
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,478
Mama said for thee to hurry up.

64
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:22,548
She's the preacher.
Meeting can't start till she's there.

65
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:27,018
And anyway, Caleb Cope and me
are riding our horses to Meeting.

66
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:34,285
Thee old long arms!

67
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:36,460
Look! Pa's warming up Red Rover.

68
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,963
Where?

69
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:04,982
How a horse can look so fast
and move so slow beats me.

70
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,699
Thee can hitch him up, Enoch.

71
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:16,097
You got him nice and warm this morning.

72
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:21,403
Whoa, Mildred!

73
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:22,474
Hello there.

74
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:26,509
Guess I'm lost.
Must have got on the wrong road.

75
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:30,548
My! Quite a looker, that horse.

76
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:31,947
He's a looker, all right.

77
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:35,682
Maybe you can help me. I'm trying
to find that Methodist church.

78
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,655
Thy first turn's at the crossroads.
Bear right for three miles.

79
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,658
Is thee preaching there this morning?

80
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,489
- Who's preaching there?
- Thee?

81
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,634
- Who?
- Thee.

82
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:46,802
Me?

83
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:51,369
That's a dandy!
Son, I'm not a man of the cloth.

84
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:52,872
I sell organs.

85
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:56,637
Now, what in thunderation is all this
thee-ing and thou-ing about?

86
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,507
Bible talk to honor the Sabbath?

87
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:01,611
No, we talk that way weekdays too.

88
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,212
Excuse me, but it sounds mighty queer.

89
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:05,947
Who's "we"?

90
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:07,623
Quakers.

91
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:10,691
Quakers! Have you folks
got a church around here?

92
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:14,385
Yes, we call it a Meeting House.
It's just beyond the Methodist Church.

93
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:17,860
Hast thou an organ in thine
Meeting House, friend?

94
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:20,031
We don't hold with music playing.

95
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:21,667
What, no organ?

96
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:25,140
Dear me! Why, a church
without an organ...

97
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:27,536
...is like a tree without a bird.

98
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:30,176
Wait till I talk
to that minister of yours.

99
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,780
He'll never be content
until he buys an organ.

100
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,345
I wish thee luck with the preacher.

101
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:40,045
That's three miles over, take
the main road, turn right. I got it.

102
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,314
Thank you.

103
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:42,786
Thee.

104
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,152
Get up!

105
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,788
Now look, Mildred...

106
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:49,258
...there is a horse!

107
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,495
- I'm going by Caleb's, Pa.
- All right, son.

108
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:59,405
Red Rover, that man
paid thee a compliment.

109
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:02,203
If he only knew.

110
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,216
Listen, Red, just don't slow down...

111
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,149
...when thee hears Sam Jordan
coming behind us...

112
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:16,755
...and, by sugar, we'll stay
out in front today.

113
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:20,588
- Thee say something, Jess?
- I was just soothing Red Rover.

114
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:24,626
If thee talked as much to the Almighty
as thee does to that horse...

115
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,167
...thee might stand more squarely
in the light.

116
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,698
Sounds like thy sermon's
already begun, Eliza.

117
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:33,740
Why, Jess!
I thought thee liked my preaching.

118
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,172
Now, Eliza, thee has the prettiest
pulpit voice I ever heard.

119
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,315
And thee says the truest words.

120
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:42,882
Especially during Silent Meeting?

121
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:48,453
And this morning,
thee looks like a girl.

122
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,188
Where's Little Jess? Mattie!

123
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:54,225
I'm coming, Mama.

124
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:01,764
Made the stockade in the nick of time.

125
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,811
- Goodbye, folks.
- Goodbye, Enoch.

126
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:16,212
Good luck, Mr. Birdwell.

127
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:19,582
Why does Enoch wish thee good luck
every First Day morning?

128
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,782
I guess it's because he...
He wishes me luck!

129
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:25,881
Hey, Papa, look!

130
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,290
It's thy friend, Sam Jordon, Jess.

131
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:34,862
No need to look. I can feel him.

132
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,395
Gard's with him!

133
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:43,095
Mattie, Little Jess, stop craning
thy necks at the Jordans.

134
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:45,063
It isn't seemly.

135
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,708
Yes, Mama.

136
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,545
Sure are a-coming.

137
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:59,113
Thee's not urging thy horse?

138
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:02,815
Not urging. Just encouraging a mite.

139
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:30,047
Come on, Red Rover!

140
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:31,686
Sit down!

141
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:45,400
Come on, Prince!

142
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:47,365
Come on, lazybones!

143
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,775
Come on, Prince! Good boy!

144
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:04,147
What's gotten into thee?

145
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,665
Morning, Mattie.

146
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,501
Morning, Eliza.
Good morning, Jess.

147
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:37,078
- Come on, Papa!
- Come on, Prince!

148
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:43,154
Come back, come back!

149
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:44,391
Mama!

150
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:46,859
Little Jess, let go!

151
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:49,260
Come on, Prince!

152
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,592
Gard winked at Mattie.

153
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,764
He did not!

154
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,232
I saw him.

155
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:02,963
Gard wouldn't do such a vulgar thing!

156
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:17,319
I hope nobody saw us.

157
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:20,089
Me too.

158
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:26,388
I want to come to Meeting with nothing
in my heart but peace and love.

159
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,476
Thee gives me a pain.

160
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:38,561
<i>One eternal day</i>

161
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:42,696
<i>There, God the Son
Forever reigns</i>

162
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,835
<i>And scatters night away</i>

163
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:49,370
<i>Filled with delight
My raptured soul</i>

164
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:52,771
<i>Would here no longer stay</i>

165
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:56,072
<i>Though Jordan's waves around me roll</i>

166
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,078
<i>Fearless I'd launch away</i>

167
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:28,004
Last week...

168
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:31,139
...I had my 80th birthday.

169
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:35,384
<i>And I'd like to bear witness
to Proverbs.</i>

170
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:38,187
First chapter...

171
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,289
...33rd verse.

172
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:44,260
"Who so harkeneth unto Me...

173
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,294
...shall dwell safely...

174
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:50,832
...and shall be quiet
from fear of evil. "

175
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:54,631
Amen, Emma. Amen.

176
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:12,550
I ask the prayers of everyone here
to help me be less worldly...

177
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:15,452
...less concerned about my appearance...

178
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:17,251
...to mind my tongue...

179
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:20,953
...and especially have the strength
not to wear earrings.

180
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:27,232
I've never spoken in Meeting before...

181
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:31,101
...but I feel so happy this morning
I'd like to share my happiness...

182
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:33,139
...with everyone in the whole world.

183
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,341
And to thank our Heavenly Father.

184
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:49,587
God is love!

185
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,604
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.

186
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,346
Won't thee come in, friend?

187
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:17,309
Thank you.

188
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,976
You're the minister of this meeting?

189
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,613
I am. One of them.

190
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:39,994
My name is Major Harvey.

191
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:43,140
- Won't thee sit down, friend?
- Thank you, no.

192
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:49,145
I've had the duty placed upon me of
speaking to you Quakers about the war.

193
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,806
It is a matter much on our minds...

194
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:53,416
...and in our prayers.

195
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:55,552
But your men don't fight in it.

196
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,688
Some have.

197
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:00,090
But you do not encourage them.

198
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,585
We do not encourage them.

199
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:07,559
Ma'am, the Union has endured
two years of bloody civil war.

200
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:11,836
Thousands have given their lives in
battle to free our country from slavery.

201
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:15,938
We are opposed to slavery.

202
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:21,712
But we do not believe it right
to kill one man to free another.

203
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:28,348
Ma'am, it's not going to be a question
of fighting for freedom or a principle...

204
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:32,284
...but of protecting our own towns,
our own homes, from attack.

205
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:45,093
Would you men stand by while others
die to protect you?

206
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:59,974
You look like a boy who could give a
good account of himself.

207
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,885
I've been tempted to fight.

208
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:05,489
I guess the Good Lord knows why.

209
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,325
I mean, sometimes I get the
sinful wish to get into a scrap.

210
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:15,090
So I got to watch myself
closer than most people.

211
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,868
So I'll just stay away from the war.

212
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:21,597
Because if I ever got into it,
I'd be a goner.

213
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:28,309
And you, son?

214
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:32,743
Are you ready to put up with looting
and killing without lifting a finger?

215
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,249
Are you afraid to fight?

216
00:24:39,457 --> 00:24:40,948
I don't know.

217
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,598
Here, at last, is an honest answer.

218
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:48,995
I don't wish to offend...

219
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:53,000
...but how many of you are hiding
behind your church to save your skins?

220
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:57,669
Is it right to let others fight for you?

221
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:01,277
To protect your lives and your property?

222
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,683
Why don't you speak up?

223
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:07,985
I'll speak up.

224
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:14,425
Nothing could ever induce me
to bear arms against my fellow man.

225
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:15,794
Burn my house!

226
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:19,257
Destroy my crops! Attack my family!

227
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:22,626
And I declare to all...

228
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,499
...especially to thee, Josh Birdwell,
wavering in thy convictions...

229
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,836
...nothing can move me to violence!

230
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,543
Nothing!

231
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:41,909
It seems Friend Purdy has already
been moved to considerable violence.

232
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:46,556
I misdoubt any of us here
could say with surety...

233
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,988
...what we would do in case of attack.

234
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:55,700
I have my doubts as to the strength
of thy convictions too.

235
00:25:57,136 --> 00:25:59,296
I have my own doubts.

236
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:05,205
I've often asked myself...

237
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:09,505
...what I would do if I saw
my family endangered...

238
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:13,143
...my wife and children threatened.

239
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:19,390
If the test comes, all I can say is...

240
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:22,889
...I hope and pray I can be an
instrument of the Lord.

241
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:26,359
That test is coming.

242
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,398
It may well be so, friend.

243
00:26:31,237 --> 00:26:34,604
Let us pray that the will of God
be revealed to us...

244
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:38,971
...and we be given the strength
and grace to follow His will.

245
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:51,155
Lord...

246
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:55,792
...let Thy children partake of Thy love
and the love of all men...

247
00:26:55,995 --> 00:27:00,227
...rendering not evil for evil,
nor violence for violence done.

248
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,564
Let swords be changed into
ploughshares...

249
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,364
...and spears into pruning hooks...

250
00:27:07,672 --> 00:27:11,131
...and children of peace
learn war no more...

251
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,608
...forever.

252
00:28:38,831 --> 00:28:41,926
Eliza, what does thee like about
that shifty-eyed bird?

253
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:43,931
Why, Jess!

254
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:47,633
She marches along so lordly-like.

255
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,210
Marched real lordly through two pecks
of young strawberries this morning.

256
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:09,694
- Hello, Gard.
- Hello, Josh.

257
00:29:09,895 --> 00:29:11,920
- You home on leave?
- Got a week's furlough.

258
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,760
Hello, Little Jess, Mrs. Birdwell.

259
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,059
Hello, Mr. Birdwell.

260
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,305
I came over to apologize about
that little brush last Sunday.

261
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:25,499
It wasn't my idea.

262
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:26,837
We know that.

263
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:31,244
Jess is going to get a nice slow horse
that doesn't have any racing ideas.

264
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:35,719
Did thee shoot any rebs?

265
00:29:37,223 --> 00:29:38,883
What are they like?

266
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:41,287
They're just people like us.

267
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:43,225
But did thee shoot any?

268
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:45,125
Let's have no more talk of war...

269
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:46,628
...and killing.

270
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:48,124
I'm sorry, ma'am.

271
00:29:48,335 --> 00:29:50,666
- Come in and set.
- Thank you.

272
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:53,437
You folks going to the fair?

273
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:56,139
I used to like the fair...

274
00:29:56,743 --> 00:29:59,040
...but it's come to be
no place for us.

275
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:00,871
They've got some fine exhibits.

276
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:03,675
Needlework, livestock, poultry.

277
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:05,281
And geese.

278
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:09,114
Eliza, it might be just the place
to pick us up a nice slow horse.

279
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:13,917
Thee go, Jess. The fair's come to have
so many sideshows, freaks, dancing...

280
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:16,789
Dancing?
What does thee know about dancing?

281
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:19,055
She knows a thing or two.

282
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:21,324
Did Mama ever dance?

283
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:24,092
That was 20 years ago.

284
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:26,100
Twenty years exactly, come October.

285
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:27,465
I was courting her.

286
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:29,107
But did Mama dance?

287
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:31,007
No, child.

288
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:35,473
She was tempted to lift a foot,
but she married me instead.

289
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:38,084
Did thee propose then and there?

290
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:40,215
Dinner's ready.
Stay and eat with us?

291
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,853
Thank you, ma'am.
I'd be pleased to.

292
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:44,822
What about the fair?

293
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:47,457
- Come on, Josh, Jess.
- Can we go, Papa?

294
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,096
There's no point in putting temptation
in the children's paths.

295
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:52,264
We'd resist it.

296
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:54,831
We'd resist it as well as thee did.

297
00:30:55,034 --> 00:30:56,195
Why can't we go?

298
00:30:56,402 --> 00:31:00,862
She'll never let us go.
Mama's so straight-laced!

299
00:31:04,544 --> 00:31:07,307
Maybe I can loosen up a few laces.

300
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:49,178
Isn't it ghastly, ladies and gentlemen?

301
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:50,856
Isn't it horrible?

302
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:53,617
This shining blade,
with the razor-edged blade...

303
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:56,386
...will pass through his mouth,
through his throat...

304
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:58,587
...into his very vitals!

305
00:31:59,532 --> 00:32:01,193
And here we have Flame-o...

306
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:03,199
...the Human Volcano!

307
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,266
Do not deprive your children
of this educational act.

308
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,603
Let's get away from here.

309
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:12,902
- I promised Caleb I'd meet him.
- Mattie, look at the quilting with me.

310
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:18,043
Thee wants to see quilts, Josh wants to
meet Caleb, and I want to see livestock.

311
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:19,479
Let's meet...

312
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:22,754
...over here by the harvesting machine
in one hour.

313
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,585
Thee stay with me.

314
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,223
Oh, Josh.

315
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:31,363
There's a rock exhibit I think
thee and Caleb might find edifying.

316
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:33,825
- Rocks?
- Come along.

317
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:36,062
I'm hungry. I want some candy.

318
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,837
Thee's had thy breakfast. Come along.

319
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:41,031
I'm thirsty.

320
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:45,876
You shoot that squirrel down
three times, you get a beautiful prize.

321
00:32:46,513 --> 00:32:47,571
It's a hit!

322
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:48,913
How's that?

323
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:49,979
Got him.

324
00:32:50,183 --> 00:32:51,241
Howdy, Mr. Birdwell.

325
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:54,147
Say, you're an old squirrel-shooter.
I'll treat you.

326
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:58,190
Give that man a rifle.
Another marksman here.

327
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:00,655
That squirrel sits so still
he makes me nervous.

328
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:02,795
Never mind the comments, just hit...

329
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:05,456
He did hit the squirrel!

330
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,099
Where's Mattie?

331
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:10,235
They're over by the quilting booth.

332
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:11,801
See you later.

333
00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:12,835
Thanks, Gard.

334
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,007
Folks, the man's about to shoot...

335
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,305
He hit it again!

336
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:34,451
Thee wait right here.

337
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,196
You won yourself one of these
beautiful prizes here.

338
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,027
One of these beautiful pri...

339
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:18,568
One of these beautiful prizes.
Them prizes was made and manufactured...

340
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:21,536
...by Pierre of Paris, France.
You heard of him?

341
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:26,541
I ain't either. The man's having a
hard time to make up his mind here.

342
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:28,806
For Eliza?

343
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:30,312
- No, thanks.
- Wait!

344
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:33,485
You won it fair and square.
I insist you take them, friend.

345
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:36,553
There! Pair of garters
for your wife to wear!

346
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:38,724
Or your sweetheart!

347
00:34:40,627 --> 00:34:42,755
Just as soon as you get out of mourning.

348
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,321
Come on.
I want to show you something.

349
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:54,039
How about a demonstration?

350
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,731
I'd just be delighted.

351
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:58,173
Delighted. Step right in, gentlemen.

352
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:00,370
Nothing would please me more.

353
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:02,609
Low bridge.

354
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:14,188
Well, Mr. Birdwell, come right in.

355
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:17,852
Gentlemen, welcome to my organatorium.
Just make yourself at home.

356
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:20,966
A temple of temptations,
full of instruments of the devil.

357
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:25,298
Gentlemen, I'd like you to take
a look at this magnificent instrument.

358
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:27,097
Now, isn't that a beauty?

359
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:30,970
Just as smooth as silk,
and as fine as frog's hair.

360
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:42,949
I'll pay two to one if you guess
the shell which contains the pea.

361
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:45,983
Take your chin off the board.
You'll tip it.

362
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:48,627
As you see, there's nothing here,
nothing here.

363
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:51,263
The pea's there,
and I put the shell over it.

364
00:35:51,464 --> 00:35:53,763
Now, we move the shells.
Watch very closely.

365
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,601
Now where is the elusive little pea?

366
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:18,749
Boy...

367
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:21,018
...will you go away?

368
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:26,162
Forty-eight reeds,
plus the tuba miraballis.

369
00:36:26,366 --> 00:36:27,959
How many stops?

370
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:30,367
So you know organs!

371
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:33,199
It has eight stops
and this vox humana.

372
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:36,000
Cries like a baby, sighs like a woman.

373
00:36:36,676 --> 00:36:40,010
I'm partial to music, but I'm a Quaker
and they're against music.

374
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:41,112
The Quaker!

375
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:44,216
Why, certainly I remember distinctly.

376
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:47,045
Thee, thy, thou...
Of course.

377
00:36:47,254 --> 00:36:50,587
But I want you to know, sir,
I honor your prejudices...

378
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,780
...convictions.

379
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:53,357
Boys, let me tell you...

380
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,121
...there are two kinds of music just the
same as there are two kinds of women:

381
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,731
The uplifting kind and the...

382
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:00,922
Now, here.

383
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,194
You take the banjo. Now, there.

384
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:06,837
There is an instrument that stirs up
a man's worst passions.

385
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:30,855
Speech!

386
00:37:31,064 --> 00:37:32,793
Speech, ma'am!

387
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:44,370
Thank thee kindly.

388
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:47,179
Watch very closely. We go again.

389
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,547
<i>Beware of the owl
Who's waiting to howl</i>

390
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:56,382
<i>Especially beware of the crow</i>

391
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:01,921
<i>Of the...</i>

392
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,595
<i>...crow</i>

393
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:13,471
Oh, fellows!

394
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:15,301
By George! That was wonderful!

395
00:38:16,243 --> 00:38:18,404
This is that rare silver process.

396
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:21,878
You see the fine workmanship of
Professor Grady. He is the foremost...

397
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:24,640
Now where is the little pea?

398
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,828
Thank you, madam. Thank you!
Everything's back to normal now.

399
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:02,384
Now, just a minute.
Place your fingers there. That's it.

400
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:03,954
Now pump.

401
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:08,427
Wonderful!

402
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:11,531
Why, Friend Birdwell,
you've got a real touch.

403
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:14,133
A real, natural-born touch.

404
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:18,930
Ice-cold lemonade here!

405
00:39:20,674 --> 00:39:22,301
Who'll have a cold drink?

406
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:04,380
Has thee forgotten thyself?

407
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:06,315
I'm to blame.

408
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,511
Mattie didn't want to dance.
I made her.

409
00:40:08,722 --> 00:40:10,519
Let's look for thy father.

410
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:13,090
It's my last day of furlough.

411
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:17,593
I mean, I was hoping that Mattie
could stay with me for a while.

412
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:22,735
Gardiner, thy duties as a soldier
and Mattie's as a Quaker lie far apart.

413
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:25,166
God bless thee, Gard.

414
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:26,566
Come along.

415
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:29,540
Goodbye.

416
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:41,583
That's a mighty fine fight.
A mighty fine fight!

417
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:42,777
Here's your coat.

418
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:46,091
All right, men. Now's your chance
to get the Billy Goat.

419
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:48,888
Who'd like to give me a silver dollar?
Is there one man...

420
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:51,497
Caleb Cope!
He can throw the Billy Goat!

421
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,188
- Which one is that?
- There.

422
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:54,891
You mean the Quaker man here?

423
00:40:55,102 --> 00:40:57,070
Come on in here, Quaker man!

424
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:04,575
Thee shouldn't fight.

425
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:07,975
This ain't fighting.
This is just friendly wrestling.

426
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:09,239
Go get him, Quaker!

427
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,056
All right, gentlemen!

428
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:29,432
May the best man win.

429
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,296
Let's go!

430
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,361
- Did I hurt you?
- What's wrong with you?

431
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:40,507
You didn't hurt me. Let's go.

432
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:42,172
No, thanks.

433
00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:44,810
Come on. Let's go.
What's the matter with you?

434
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,449
The Quaker boy quit!

435
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,982
- Why didn't you kiss him?
- Quitter!

436
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,078
Quitter!

437
00:42:58,894 --> 00:43:00,724
Hold on. I want to talk to you.

438
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:03,624
Leave him alone.
It's against his principle to fight.

439
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,665
Losing a bet's against my principles.
I think you're in with the boss.

440
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:09,393
- No, sir.
- So why'd you stop?

441
00:43:09,604 --> 00:43:12,266
- He's a Quaker.
- Shut up! Who wants to hear you?

442
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,735
- Let them alone! These boys believe...
- I know.

443
00:43:15,943 --> 00:43:18,002
They believe in loving their neighbor.

444
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:20,807
I'm their neighbor.
Do you still love me?

445
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,573
I feel sorry for thee, friend.

446
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:24,442
Thee feels sorry for me?

447
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:27,780
Don't let him talk to you that way.
Milk sop!

448
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:32,456
If thee wants to hit
someone, friend, hit me.

449
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,360
It'll be a pleasure.

450
00:43:35,263 --> 00:43:36,787
I'll take a whack at him.

451
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:38,261
You want to fight?

452
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:42,601
You aren't showing me nothing.
What's the matter, Quaker boy?

453
00:43:42,805 --> 00:43:45,864
- What's the trouble, friend?
- Another friend!

454
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:49,909
Thee needs cooling off.

455
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:52,343
My hat!

456
00:43:53,447 --> 00:43:55,938
- Let me up!
- Thee not thirsty, friend?

457
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:08,193
Is thee having an altercation?

458
00:44:11,867 --> 00:44:13,993
Okay, let's break it up.
Come on.

459
00:44:20,108 --> 00:44:21,074
Fighting!

460
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:23,209
Dancing! Gambling!

461
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:25,140
Wrestling! And...

462
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,181
- Sleeve-holders.
- Sleeve-holders?

463
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:30,350
I never saw sleeve-holders like that.

464
00:44:30,552 --> 00:44:31,984
They're from...

465
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,185
...Pierre, in Paris.

466
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,726
Listen, thee dirty...

467
00:44:43,865 --> 00:44:46,528
But Mama, he took my hat.

468
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:13,186
It'll be a pretty day. Be hot
the other side of the Ohio though.

469
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:15,857
I wish thee didn't have to
make this trip.

470
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,462
It's too close to the war to be safe.

471
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:21,293
Now, Eliza, I have to
see my customers...

472
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,230
...this time of the year.

473
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:28,872
Leave Josh at home then.
He's so young to be exposed to danger.

474
00:45:29,077 --> 00:45:31,739
Thee can't keep him tied
to thy apron strings.

475
00:45:31,947 --> 00:45:33,778
This trip will be good for him.

476
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:38,711
Horse is hitched, bags stowed away,
we're off! Let's go!

477
00:45:40,022 --> 00:45:41,852
Is thee so anxious to leave home?

478
00:45:42,057 --> 00:45:43,683
I want to see Ohio.

479
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,123
I'll miss thee.

480
00:45:54,236 --> 00:45:55,863
Come on, Pa!

481
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:06,513
Take good care of Josh.

482
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,279
God bless and keep thee.

483
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,765
Jess, see if thee can't
get rid of that horse.

484
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,078
- Afternoon.
- Howdy!

485
00:47:44,346 --> 00:47:45,540
Man of the house around?

486
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:49,182
Ain't no man in this house
since Pa died.

487
00:47:54,322 --> 00:47:56,381
And Mrs. Hudsp...

488
00:47:57,225 --> 00:47:58,123
Hudspeth?

489
00:47:58,326 --> 00:47:59,554
Ma's here.

490
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,164
Couple of men to see you!

491
00:48:07,402 --> 00:48:08,233
Men!

492
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:14,465
Men?

493
00:48:23,585 --> 00:48:24,745
Ma's coming!

494
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:28,686
Hi!

495
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:32,253
Hello.

496
00:49:04,926 --> 00:49:06,952
- Mrs. Hudspeth?
- That's me.

497
00:49:07,162 --> 00:49:10,359
I'm Jess Birdwell. I have
first-class nursery stock for sale.

498
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:12,830
- What kind?
- Everything in orchard fruits.

499
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:17,664
If thee likes apple trees, there's
Maiden's Blush, Ramblos and Winesaps.

500
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:22,411
In the berry line, there's
raspberries, gooseberries and the like.

501
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:25,146
- This your boy?
- This is Joshua.

502
00:49:25,347 --> 00:49:26,678
Meet my girls.

503
00:49:26,883 --> 00:49:30,216
This is Opal, Ruby,
she's my baby, and Pearl.

504
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:32,145
Gems, every one of them!

505
00:49:32,354 --> 00:49:34,152
Girls, meet Joshua.

506
00:49:36,925 --> 00:49:38,086
Back!

507
00:49:39,128 --> 00:49:41,119
Don't overdo it, girls.

508
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:44,322
Come in the house.
Let's talk business in comfort.

509
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:50,399
Sit down, son.

510
00:49:50,605 --> 00:49:52,436
They won't bite you.

511
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:04,876
Menfolks are so scarce here, the girls
get carried away at the sight of one.

512
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:08,419
But I keep telling them, "Easy does it. "

513
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:10,350
Ain't that right?

514
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:14,187
As a Quaker, I've always been
against violence, Mrs. Hudspeth.

515
00:50:14,496 --> 00:50:15,964
A Quaker, huh?

516
00:50:16,198 --> 00:50:19,031
I guessed as much
from the way you talk.

517
00:50:19,302 --> 00:50:21,428
All that thee-ing and thy-ing.

518
00:50:21,637 --> 00:50:25,436
If I put my mind to it, I can say
you or yours if it suits thee.

519
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:26,938
No, sir.

520
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:30,044
"Pleased to meet thee.
Are these thy daughters?"

521
00:50:30,246 --> 00:50:32,237
Prettiest talk I ever heard.

522
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:35,440
Makes me feel kind of romantic.

523
00:50:35,684 --> 00:50:36,674
Come sit down.

524
00:50:37,386 --> 00:50:39,649
Let's talk business back here.

525
00:50:40,356 --> 00:50:42,017
You been on the road long?

526
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:45,259
About ten days.
Heading home tomorrow.

527
00:50:50,299 --> 00:50:51,561
See any rebel raiders?

528
00:50:51,968 --> 00:50:54,129
Everything peaceful all the way.

529
00:50:54,336 --> 00:50:55,361
I hope you're right.

530
00:50:55,938 --> 00:50:59,271
What if them ruffians come thieving
with nobody on the farm...

531
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:00,965
...but four defenseless women?

532
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:05,042
I shudder to think of it.

533
00:51:05,881 --> 00:51:08,907
Now, about that nursery stock...

534
00:51:09,118 --> 00:51:10,584
First look at my south 40...

535
00:51:10,786 --> 00:51:14,085
...and tell me what orchard stock
would be best there. Opal!

536
00:51:17,426 --> 00:51:19,394
Go hitch up Lady.

537
00:51:19,594 --> 00:51:21,425
We'll drive my mare.

538
00:51:21,631 --> 00:51:23,690
Give your animal a rest.

539
00:51:27,603 --> 00:51:29,400
We can bed you down for the night.

540
00:51:30,706 --> 00:51:32,799
That's very kind.

541
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:35,571
- But...
- Oh, now, no buts!

542
00:51:35,778 --> 00:51:38,302
Glad to have some men around
for a change.

543
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:39,742
Ruby.

544
00:51:40,483 --> 00:51:42,951
Go lay out some clean bedding,
will you?

545
00:51:43,152 --> 00:51:44,414
All right, Ma.

546
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,212
Get going.

547
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:51,190
Pearl, take care of Josh
while we're gone.

548
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,762
Now, you just set right back here.

549
00:52:04,674 --> 00:52:06,801
I don't want to be a bother.

550
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,701
You ain't no bother.

551
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,508
Sure is a nice place thee has here.

552
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:15,974
Want a smoke?

553
00:52:16,185 --> 00:52:17,743
I don't smoke.

554
00:52:19,088 --> 00:52:20,055
Want a drink?

555
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:21,780
I don't drink either.

556
00:52:21,991 --> 00:52:23,253
Thee have one.

557
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:25,359
Not unless you do.

558
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:10,671
Is this a Narragansett Pacer?

559
00:53:11,674 --> 00:53:13,403
You know that breed?

560
00:53:14,176 --> 00:53:16,338
Thee's a favored woman.

561
00:53:16,545 --> 00:53:18,775
That mare ain't got
but one real fault.

562
00:53:19,248 --> 00:53:21,307
She won't be passed.

563
00:53:22,685 --> 00:53:25,483
- Won't be passed?
- No, sir!

564
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:27,447
What's the fault in that?

565
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,054
I've got three marriageable daughters.

566
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:33,817
A man ain't got any heart for courting
a girl he can't catch up with...

567
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:35,622
...let alone pass.

568
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:42,832
It shouldn't be hard to find
a horse willing to be passed.

569
00:53:43,572 --> 00:53:45,370
Hello, Abigail!

570
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:48,309
That's old Whiskey Pete.

571
00:53:48,512 --> 00:53:51,743
He ain't drawed a sober breath
in 30 years.

572
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:02,151
Fool's always trying to race somebody.

573
00:54:09,398 --> 00:54:10,990
Old drunk!

574
00:54:15,138 --> 00:54:18,266
Why don't thee let her out?
Don't fight her. Let her go!

575
00:54:18,474 --> 00:54:23,275
I'm going to learn this consarned mare
she's got to be passed!

576
00:54:27,116 --> 00:54:27,947
Put my hat on!

577
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,481
Pull it down!

578
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:31,813
Not that far!

579
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,118
What are you doing?

580
00:54:39,328 --> 00:54:40,694
It's all right.

581
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,254
Easy, Lady. Easy.

582
00:55:09,092 --> 00:55:13,153
Sorry, I kind of overreached myself,
grabbing the reins thataway.

583
00:55:14,531 --> 00:55:16,226
Don't apologize.

584
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,560
For a man, it's suitable to beat
another man in a race on a public road.

585
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:29,070
Do you ever think about getting
thy girls a horse a mite more...

586
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,802
...maidenly-acting?

587
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,042
I've thought of it.

588
00:55:35,151 --> 00:55:37,345
You've got a stylish animal.

589
00:55:38,054 --> 00:55:39,953
Red Rover's a looker, all right.

590
00:55:40,156 --> 00:55:42,147
Got racing notions?

591
00:55:43,092 --> 00:55:45,561
Not that he can't pick up
his heels a bit.

592
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:48,560
But racing's a thing
he's got no stomach for.

593
00:55:49,299 --> 00:55:51,824
You wouldn't consider a trade, I reckon.

594
00:55:54,703 --> 00:55:55,693
I don't know.

595
00:55:55,905 --> 00:55:59,034
A strong-minded animal like this
can be a plaguey nuisance.

596
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:03,143
A forceful man like yourself
could learn her better in no time.

597
00:56:03,346 --> 00:56:05,246
If you's a mind to.

598
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:09,881
Seems a likely exchange.

599
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:11,986
Then let's shake on it.

600
00:56:13,189 --> 00:56:14,554
Don't leave it hanging.

601
00:56:30,774 --> 00:56:34,709
<i>A handsome young drummer
Came by in the spring</i>

602
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:37,445
<i>With beautiful laces</i>

603
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:39,911
<i>In cases</i>

604
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:43,176
<i>I'm sorry, she said</i>

605
00:56:43,386 --> 00:56:46,719
<i>I can't buy anything</i>

606
00:56:46,922 --> 00:56:50,984
<i>'Tis love that I need</i>

607
00:56:51,227 --> 00:56:54,059
<i>More than laces</i>

608
00:56:56,266 --> 00:57:00,225
<i>Won't you marry me</i>

609
00:57:00,904 --> 00:57:02,166
<i>Marry me</i>

610
00:57:02,606 --> 00:57:05,370
<i>Up to the altar please carry me</i>

611
00:57:05,575 --> 00:57:09,341
<i>Give me combs for my curls
Made of silver and pearls</i>

612
00:57:09,545 --> 00:57:12,515
<i>And a two-penny bridal bouquet</i>

613
00:57:12,716 --> 00:57:14,411
<i>Say</i>

614
00:57:14,784 --> 00:57:15,910
<i>Hurry up</i>

615
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:17,686
<i>Hurry up</i>

616
00:57:17,887 --> 00:57:20,651
<i>Hitch that old horse to the surrey up</i>

617
00:57:20,857 --> 00:57:24,384
<i>And I'll vow to be true
To no one but you</i>

618
00:57:24,594 --> 00:57:28,587
<i>So marry me, marry me, do</i>

619
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:35,061
<i>Dear Lady,
The handsome young drummer replied</i>

620
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:39,799
<i>The whole situation's bewildering</i>

621
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,639
<i>Last winter the cough</i>

622
00:57:43,847 --> 00:57:47,614
<i>Carried off my poor bride</i>

623
00:57:47,817 --> 00:57:52,186
<i>If you want to take care</i>

624
00:57:52,922 --> 00:57:56,517
<i>Of six children</i>

625
00:57:57,994 --> 00:58:01,054
<i>Come and marry me</i>

626
00:58:01,297 --> 00:58:02,559
<i>Marry me</i>

627
00:58:02,766 --> 00:58:05,200
<i>Pack your valises and marry me</i>

628
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:26,383
They're coming!

629
00:58:32,962 --> 00:58:34,055
They're coming!

630
00:58:53,516 --> 00:58:55,746
I'm glad to have thee home.

631
00:58:58,088 --> 00:59:00,318
- Thee'll break my ribs!
- I'll get the bags.

632
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:03,416
I'm glad thee's back.
I've missed thee.

633
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:04,718
I've missed thee.

634
00:59:04,929 --> 00:59:06,419
Come, thee must be hungry.

635
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:09,291
- Where's Mattie?
- She'll be back soon.

636
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:14,069
Where'd thee get this horse?

637
00:59:15,205 --> 00:59:16,968
Thee kept thy word.

638
00:59:17,174 --> 00:59:19,734
Thee got rid of Red Rover.

639
00:59:21,544 --> 00:59:23,172
Glad to see you.

640
00:59:25,683 --> 00:59:27,172
Is this horse well?

641
00:59:27,383 --> 00:59:29,374
There's nothing to fear on that score.

642
00:59:29,587 --> 00:59:32,521
She's not much to look at.
But if thee doesn't mind that...

643
00:59:32,723 --> 00:59:33,711
Mind!

644
00:59:33,924 --> 00:59:36,824
This is the very horse
I've been praying for.

645
00:59:37,026 --> 00:59:41,326
A good, plain animal that won't fill
every man on the pike with racing ideas.

646
00:59:41,531 --> 00:59:44,864
Lady'll discourage racing ideas,
I promise thee.

647
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:46,763
Come in.
Thee must be starved.

648
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:49,165
We haven't had a good meal
since we left.

649
00:59:49,372 --> 00:59:50,772
I'll be in in a minute.

650
00:59:51,107 --> 00:59:53,041
I'll help thee unhitch, Enoch.

651
01:00:01,085 --> 01:00:02,745
This looks like the place.

652
01:00:04,455 --> 01:00:05,443
Hello, there!

653
01:00:05,656 --> 01:00:08,819
Good evening.
Certainly is good to see you again.

654
01:00:10,294 --> 01:00:11,225
Here we are.

655
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:14,727
Good evening.

656
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:17,765
You know, it is certainly
a pleasure to see you.

657
01:00:18,768 --> 01:00:20,634
This is a joy I've been waiting for.

658
01:00:20,837 --> 01:00:21,896
I offer you...

659
01:00:22,105 --> 01:00:25,564
...my salutations, my felicitations
and my congratulations.

660
01:00:26,075 --> 01:00:27,441
What for?

661
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:29,408
Why, ma'am, this organ.

662
01:00:29,613 --> 01:00:31,581
The world's finest!

663
01:00:31,815 --> 01:00:35,308
You've got a treat coming to you.
Just hold your breath.

664
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,952
Now look at that.
Isn't that a beauty?

665
01:00:39,522 --> 01:00:43,550
Genuine walnut. Not an inch of
unornamented wood in the entire cabinet.

666
01:00:44,528 --> 01:00:47,520
Good evening, Brother Birdwell!
Hello, there.

667
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:51,757
There must be some mistake.
This gentleman says thee's mixed up...

668
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:53,334
...with this musical instrument.

669
01:00:53,537 --> 01:00:57,666
"Mixed" is scarcely the word for it.
It's gone beyond courting to marriage.

670
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:59,433
Your husband...

671
01:00:59,643 --> 01:01:03,943
Thy husband is now the proud
and lucky owner of a Payson and Clarke.

672
01:01:04,747 --> 01:01:09,685
This organ. This substitute on earth
for choiring angels.

673
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:13,415
Father Birdwell, why keep
the lady in suspense?

674
01:01:13,624 --> 01:01:16,525
You just give me a hand
and we'll get it inside.

675
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,294
We must step delicately.
My wife is a Quaker minister.

676
01:01:20,497 --> 01:01:23,988
You may know all about
Quaker ministers, but I know women.

677
01:01:24,201 --> 01:01:27,226
What a woman wants is a good,
firm hand and a strong voice.

678
01:01:27,438 --> 01:01:28,871
Not Eliza.

679
01:01:32,408 --> 01:01:34,434
Wait until you hear your husband...

680
01:01:34,645 --> 01:01:36,704
...when he seats himself
at this console.

681
01:01:36,913 --> 01:01:39,439
You know, you are married to an artist.

682
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,042
I forbid thee to have this instrument!

683
01:01:43,988 --> 01:01:45,478
"Forbid"?

684
01:01:47,224 --> 01:01:50,193
For thy own sake, I forbid.

685
01:01:51,595 --> 01:01:53,256
When thee asks...

686
01:01:53,464 --> 01:01:54,987
...or suggests...

687
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:57,099
...I'm like putty in thy hands.

688
01:01:57,301 --> 01:02:00,134
But when thee forbids,
thee is barking up the wrong tree.

689
01:02:02,373 --> 01:02:04,898
- Come on, Quigley.
- I don't know what's come over thee.

690
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:09,876
Bringing a thing like this here.
And me a recorded minister!

691
01:02:12,383 --> 01:02:15,511
Thee order that instrument back
to where it came from.

692
01:02:17,655 --> 01:02:19,748
I bought it and I'm going to keep it.

693
01:02:25,963 --> 01:02:28,193
I don't know what's come over thee.

694
01:02:28,399 --> 01:02:29,457
I'm warning thee...

695
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:33,159
...if thee takes that instrument
into the house, I go out.

696
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:37,204
Make thy choice. Thee can have
that instrument or thy wife.

697
01:02:37,408 --> 01:02:39,638
But both thee cannot have!

698
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:46,039
Come on, help me get it in.

699
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,789
Will thee please fetch my shawl...

700
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:53,854
...and my Bible?

701
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,592
What does thee plan to do?

702
01:02:56,794 --> 01:02:57,988
If that...

703
01:02:58,195 --> 01:02:59,822
...thing goes into the house...

704
01:03:00,264 --> 01:03:02,096
...I go to the barn!

705
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:03,693
The barn?

706
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:05,869
Did thee have something to say to me?

707
01:03:14,678 --> 01:03:16,373
Well, Jess!

708
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:24,487
Come on, Quigley!

709
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:28,146
Will thee see if there
is anything thy mother needs?

710
01:04:32,156 --> 01:04:33,418
Stop it!

711
01:04:36,727 --> 01:04:39,355
Will thee please stop playing?

712
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:40,757
Go sit over there.

713
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:42,057
Why?

714
01:04:42,266 --> 01:04:44,200
I don't know why. Just sit.

715
01:04:56,547 --> 01:04:58,037
Evening, Jess.

716
01:04:58,249 --> 01:04:59,806
Come in, Sam.

717
01:05:01,453 --> 01:05:03,113
Just felt like visiting.

718
01:05:05,055 --> 01:05:07,023
- Evening, children.
- Evening, Mr. Jordan.

719
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:09,456
I heard you had a new horse.

720
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,253
Like to get a look at it.

721
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:14,162
It's kind of late.

722
01:05:14,365 --> 01:05:16,525
Is this horse an early sleeper?

723
01:05:19,404 --> 01:05:20,928
Oh well, anytime.

724
01:05:21,138 --> 01:05:22,969
- How're you?
- Fine, thank thee.

725
01:05:23,908 --> 01:05:24,965
Fine.

726
01:05:25,709 --> 01:05:27,109
How's Eliza?

727
01:05:28,112 --> 01:05:29,842
Mama's fine.

728
01:05:30,047 --> 01:05:31,811
How does thee know?

729
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:34,108
She away from home?

730
01:05:34,552 --> 01:05:36,383
Thee might say so.

731
01:05:37,689 --> 01:05:39,020
Church work?

732
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:41,685
Thee could call it that.

733
01:05:51,002 --> 01:05:52,696
Mother needs another comforter.

734
01:05:52,904 --> 01:05:55,600
That oat straw goes
right through her blanket.

735
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:00,902
Hello, Mr. Jordan.

736
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:02,878
Hello, Josh.

737
01:06:10,722 --> 01:06:11,620
Straw?

738
01:06:11,823 --> 01:06:13,154
Blanket?

739
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:15,585
Thee may as well know it.

740
01:06:15,793 --> 01:06:18,125
Eliza has taken up
residence in the barn.

741
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:20,297
The barn?

742
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:23,762
We had a slight difference of opinion.

743
01:06:36,781 --> 01:06:39,909
Papa bought this
and Mama won't stay in the house...

744
01:06:40,752 --> 01:06:42,219
...with it.

745
01:06:47,192 --> 01:06:48,819
Excuse me.

746
01:06:56,234 --> 01:06:59,931
I feel kind of responsible for this.
Let me take care of it for you.

747
01:07:00,171 --> 01:07:03,004
Thanks very much.
I think I can take care of it myself.

748
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:05,142
Anything you say.

749
01:07:08,413 --> 01:07:09,710
Good night, children.

750
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,780
Goodnight, Sam.

751
01:07:16,988 --> 01:07:18,922
Goodnight, Jess.

752
01:07:25,597 --> 01:07:26,928
Good night, everybody.

753
01:07:27,131 --> 01:07:29,190
Upstairs to bed, all of thee.

754
01:08:31,129 --> 01:08:32,619
May I come in?

755
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:41,435
Evening's cooling off a bit,
isn't it?

756
01:08:43,941 --> 01:08:46,000
I find it very pleasant.

757
01:08:48,046 --> 01:08:49,537
So do I.

758
01:09:35,059 --> 01:09:38,119
And thee promises to put the organ
up in the attic right away?

759
01:09:38,329 --> 01:09:40,194
Best place in the world for it.

760
01:09:40,432 --> 01:09:42,797
The best place is back
at the organ factory.

761
01:09:43,001 --> 01:09:44,298
Second best.

762
01:09:44,635 --> 01:09:46,500
And no playing on First Day.

763
01:09:46,704 --> 01:09:49,298
- Or when visitors are here.
- Never.

764
01:09:55,012 --> 01:09:56,843
Let's go back there sometime.

765
01:09:57,048 --> 01:09:58,106
Soon.

766
01:10:07,225 --> 01:10:08,658
It's Sam Jordon!

767
01:10:30,349 --> 01:10:31,679
Morning, Sam!

768
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,510
What's thee doing around so early?

769
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,450
What do you mean "early"? It's 6:30.

770
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:45,486
Where's Eliza? Still in the barn?

771
01:10:46,365 --> 01:10:47,662
The barn?

772
01:10:51,102 --> 01:10:53,401
You're getting rid of the organ.

773
01:11:02,915 --> 01:11:05,543
Well, how'd you bring her around?

774
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:09,515
Reasoned with her.

775
01:11:10,656 --> 01:11:12,021
Just reasoned with her.

776
01:11:17,595 --> 01:11:18,585
Want to see my new mare?

777
01:11:19,497 --> 01:11:22,331
That's what I come over for.

778
01:11:30,709 --> 01:11:32,574
Here she is.

779
01:11:36,415 --> 01:11:37,848
Over here.

780
01:11:43,722 --> 01:11:44,916
What does thee think of her?

781
01:12:04,142 --> 01:12:05,166
"Reasoned" with her?

782
01:12:06,011 --> 01:12:08,445
"Just reasoned with her. "

783
01:12:16,989 --> 01:12:17,819
Look her over.

784
01:12:27,566 --> 01:12:29,831
You traded Red Rover for this?

785
01:12:30,869 --> 01:12:32,530
I got a little to boot.

786
01:12:32,738 --> 01:12:35,673
A little? For this crow bait?

787
01:12:35,908 --> 01:12:37,773
The mare's name is Lady.

788
01:12:38,243 --> 01:12:39,540
Lady!

789
01:12:45,817 --> 01:12:47,216
What's so funny?

790
01:12:47,419 --> 01:12:48,852
Excuse me.

791
01:12:49,054 --> 01:12:52,046
It's just the rift between
the name and the looks.

792
01:12:52,257 --> 01:12:54,589
What is she? Half buffalo?

793
01:12:55,294 --> 01:12:57,888
She's half Narragansett Pacer.

794
01:12:58,096 --> 01:12:59,586
Which half?

795
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:08,906
I never laid eyes on a beast
of such dimensions!

796
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:23,813
What's this? Why aren't we
taking the surrey?

797
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:27,620
Enoch says the surrey's
missing a hub nut.

798
01:13:27,827 --> 01:13:29,259
Hub nut?

799
01:13:30,762 --> 01:13:31,592
Lost?

800
01:13:33,832 --> 01:13:36,893
I didn't say "lost", ma'am.
It's just missing.

801
01:13:37,869 --> 01:13:39,666
There's no room for the children.

802
01:13:39,871 --> 01:13:41,668
That's right. They must stay home.

803
01:13:41,907 --> 01:13:44,035
They can have their Meeting
in the parlor.

804
01:13:44,242 --> 01:13:45,607
Thee too.

805
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:47,711
I suppose thee's right.

806
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:51,883
No nonsense!

807
01:13:59,592 --> 01:14:01,183
Thank thee.

808
01:14:24,784 --> 01:14:26,718
Wouldn't surprise me a bit.

809
01:14:32,392 --> 01:14:33,551
God speed.

810
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:37,562
What does he mean, "God speed"?

811
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:43,526
He means good luck.

812
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:46,104
With this rickety rig we'll need it.

813
01:15:11,997 --> 01:15:13,430
Something wrong?

814
01:15:14,867 --> 01:15:17,392
I don't know.
I thought I better take a look.

815
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:55,474
- What is it?
- Nothing that I could see.

816
01:16:05,818 --> 01:16:06,648
Come on!

817
01:16:23,136 --> 01:16:24,831
Here comes Sam.

818
01:16:26,105 --> 01:16:30,371
I wonder how a man church-bound
can have his mind so set on speed.

819
01:16:30,576 --> 01:16:31,838
I don't.

820
01:16:51,864 --> 01:16:53,297
Slow down!

821
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:59,203
Now, Prince!

822
01:17:29,468 --> 01:17:30,765
Come on, Prince!

823
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:33,302
Giddap, boy!
What's the matter with you?

824
01:17:34,774 --> 01:17:36,207
Easy, Lady.

825
01:17:36,409 --> 01:17:37,933
Easy.

826
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,845
Come on, Prince!

827
01:17:46,853 --> 01:17:48,548
Can't thee slow her down?

828
01:17:48,754 --> 01:17:50,346
I'm trying to.

829
01:19:41,267 --> 01:19:43,065
Look at this.

830
01:19:44,603 --> 01:19:47,766
Josh, you ain't forgot
that cow's going to calf tonight?

831
01:19:47,974 --> 01:19:49,771
Call me when it's time.

832
01:19:51,511 --> 01:19:53,137
Look at this one.

833
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:02,743
Hello, Mr. Birdwell.

834
01:20:02,956 --> 01:20:04,547
Gard, come in.

835
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:07,652
- Back from the war?
- Yes. It's good to see you.

836
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:09,895
How are you?

837
01:20:10,197 --> 01:20:11,185
Thee wounded?

838
01:20:11,398 --> 01:20:13,058
Good evening, Mrs. Birdwell.

839
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,594
Thee's wounded.

840
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,993
- It's nothing.
- Was it a cannon?

841
01:20:17,204 --> 01:20:20,138
No, Little Jess.
It was just a rebel bullet.

842
01:20:20,673 --> 01:20:22,732
Did it bleed a lot?
Did thee win a medal?

843
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:25,571
That'll do, Little Jess.
Won't thee sit down?

844
01:20:25,845 --> 01:20:27,040
Thank you.

845
01:20:27,313 --> 01:20:30,181
Thee didn't say a word
about it in thy letter.

846
01:20:30,483 --> 01:20:31,576
Letter?

847
01:20:31,784 --> 01:20:33,844
I didn't want to worry you.

848
01:20:34,887 --> 01:20:37,413
- When did thee get home?
- This afternoon.

849
01:20:37,758 --> 01:20:40,783
I heard about
that little race this morning.

850
01:20:41,661 --> 01:20:42,786
Was Sam surprised?

851
01:20:42,996 --> 01:20:45,089
Surprised? He was overcome.

852
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:47,756
The Elders!

853
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:50,629
The Ministry and Oversight Committee
from our church.

854
01:20:50,937 --> 01:20:52,802
Paying us a call.

855
01:20:57,944 --> 01:20:59,172
Go on up to bed.

856
01:20:59,379 --> 01:21:00,971
Do as I say.

857
01:21:08,355 --> 01:21:09,481
Wait.

858
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:18,120
Good evening, Griffith.

859
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:20,322
Friend Cope, Amos, come in.

860
01:21:24,603 --> 01:21:25,968
Good evening, Friend Cope.

861
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,504
Griffith.

862
01:21:28,275 --> 01:21:31,540
Good evening, Amos.
Won't thee sit down?

863
01:22:01,475 --> 01:22:02,669
Natives.

864
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:08,007
Very educational.

865
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:14,087
So I started over the wall...

866
01:22:14,287 --> 01:22:16,949
...and the next thing I knew,
I was flat on my back.

867
01:22:17,324 --> 01:22:19,258
What does it feel like...

868
01:22:19,459 --> 01:22:21,120
...getting shot?

869
01:22:21,628 --> 01:22:23,358
Being kicked by a mule.

870
01:22:25,866 --> 01:22:27,697
Did thee kill anybody?

871
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:33,001
I did a lot of shooting.

872
01:22:33,874 --> 01:22:35,899
Thee won't go back now thee's wounded?

873
01:22:36,109 --> 01:22:37,337
Not right away.

874
01:22:37,611 --> 01:22:39,738
With the reb cavalry heading this way...

875
01:22:40,046 --> 01:22:42,514
...I'm assigned to organize
the home guard.

876
01:22:42,782 --> 01:22:44,875
Would they let me in the home guard?

877
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,117
Well, they need men.

878
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,982
Gard doesn't want to talk about the war.

879
01:22:50,223 --> 01:22:51,815
Does thee, Gard?

880
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:53,353
No, Mattie.

881
01:22:54,161 --> 01:22:56,095
If I went to Vernon...

882
01:23:02,969 --> 01:23:04,994
We'll talk tomorrow.

883
01:23:07,407 --> 01:23:08,669
All right.

884
01:23:16,183 --> 01:23:18,117
We've got an organ!

885
01:23:18,318 --> 01:23:19,808
An organ?

886
01:23:20,353 --> 01:23:21,980
In your house?

887
01:23:22,222 --> 01:23:23,917
What'd your mother say about that?

888
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,354
She made us put it up in the attic.

889
01:23:27,093 --> 01:23:29,527
And what of thy son,
Friend Birdwell?

890
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:32,823
Has thee give him proper guidance?

891
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:38,271
With the help of God, our children
must make their own choices.

892
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:42,135
So before we talk any more
of war or blame...

893
01:23:42,342 --> 01:23:45,607
...shall we seek wisdom
and strength in prayer?

894
01:23:47,215 --> 01:23:48,806
Let us pray.

895
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,562
Watch thy head.

896
01:24:21,615 --> 01:24:23,583
Must be the wind coming up.

897
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:27,318
Could be.
Today's acted like a weather breeder.

898
01:24:41,067 --> 01:24:44,332
Friend, thee's got
a squeaky door upstairs.

899
01:24:54,648 --> 01:24:57,208
My house needs attention.

900
01:24:57,418 --> 01:24:59,545
And my soul needs repair!

901
01:24:59,919 --> 01:25:02,285
Friends, let us lift
our hearts in prayer.

902
01:25:02,489 --> 01:25:04,855
Father in heaven,
Creator of all good things...

903
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:08,084
...Author of harmony from birdsong
to thunder roll...

904
01:25:08,295 --> 01:25:10,287
...restore harmony in our lives.

905
01:25:10,498 --> 01:25:11,556
Amen.

906
01:25:11,766 --> 01:25:13,926
Amen to that.

907
01:25:15,201 --> 01:25:18,398
Behold thy servant who has
strayed from righteousness.

908
01:25:18,605 --> 01:25:22,042
Behold thy unworthy creature
whose head was turned by...

909
01:25:22,243 --> 01:25:23,301
...the ways of the flesh.

910
01:25:23,511 --> 01:25:28,414
Forgive him for racing on First Day
and forgetting that the road to glory...

911
01:25:28,616 --> 01:25:30,379
...is a slow road.

912
01:25:32,018 --> 01:25:34,680
- And let not my sins
rest upon my children.

913
01:25:34,889 --> 01:25:36,549
Above all, spare my wife, Eliza.

914
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:39,282
And I pray that she shall find,
in her kind...

915
01:25:39,493 --> 01:25:43,930
...and loving heart, the grace and mercy
to forgive me my grievous shortcomings.

916
01:25:44,331 --> 01:25:45,492
In the name of Adam...

917
01:25:45,699 --> 01:25:47,895
...who ate the forbidden fruit,
of Abraham...

918
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:52,300
...whose sin was jealousy, in the name
of Moses, who lost the Promised Land...

919
01:25:52,506 --> 01:25:54,133
...in the name of David who...

920
01:25:54,342 --> 01:25:55,308
...of David who...

921
01:25:56,143 --> 01:25:58,111
...hankered after
that which was forbidden...

922
01:25:58,312 --> 01:26:01,577
...in the name of Jeptha,
Jeremiah, Obediah...

923
01:26:02,216 --> 01:26:03,114
...Jonah...

924
01:26:03,517 --> 01:26:04,643
...Micah...

925
01:26:04,852 --> 01:26:07,082
...Habakkuk and Malachi...

926
01:26:07,888 --> 01:26:09,445
...and Malachi...

927
01:26:31,112 --> 01:26:34,946
Thee has been an instrument
of the Lord this night.

928
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:38,846
Thy prayer carried me so near
to heaven's gates...

929
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,585
...I thought I heard the choiring
of angel voices...

930
01:26:42,923 --> 01:26:45,653
...and the playing of heavenly harps.

931
01:26:46,627 --> 01:26:50,063
Thy prayer has answered our questions.

932
01:26:51,799 --> 01:26:54,359
Thy flesh may be weak, Jess Birdwell...

933
01:26:54,634 --> 01:26:58,230
...but thy spirit is as strong
as thy voice.

934
01:26:58,839 --> 01:26:59,669
Amen.

935
01:27:00,207 --> 01:27:01,799
Amen to that.

936
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:11,583
Thank thee for paying us
this call, Friend.

937
01:27:34,742 --> 01:27:36,642
I'll play the melody up here.

938
01:27:37,111 --> 01:27:38,772
- Ready?
- All right.

939
01:27:44,953 --> 01:27:46,783
Sounds like a duet.

940
01:27:47,321 --> 01:27:48,686
Duet?

941
01:27:51,959 --> 01:27:53,325
Gard?

942
01:27:56,397 --> 01:27:57,694
Leave them be.

943
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:27,149
Mighty quiet up there.

944
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:43,339
What does thee suppose they're...

945
01:28:45,343 --> 01:28:46,503
...doing?

946
01:28:48,814 --> 01:28:50,440
Silent prayer?

947
01:28:53,518 --> 01:28:54,815
Like this?

948
01:29:07,365 --> 01:29:08,696
What's thee doing?

949
01:29:09,468 --> 01:29:11,765
Has thee forgotten we have company?

950
01:29:13,705 --> 01:29:16,230
Don't thee care what people think?

951
01:29:17,243 --> 01:29:19,211
It's all my fault.

952
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:27,149
I think we ought to go to bed
and let the young folks have the parlor.

953
01:29:28,453 --> 01:29:29,546
Good night, children.

954
01:29:29,754 --> 01:29:31,654
Good night, Mrs. Birdwell.

955
01:29:33,191 --> 01:29:35,716
Goodnight, Mattie. Goodnight, Gard.

956
01:30:03,756 --> 01:30:06,088
Thee ever see anything prettier, Enoch?

957
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:07,418
No.

958
01:30:07,627 --> 01:30:10,095
Except for a little human baby.

959
01:30:13,064 --> 01:30:14,498
Does thee have any children?

960
01:30:17,737 --> 01:30:19,705
Leastwise I did.

961
01:30:20,138 --> 01:30:22,106
I don't know where they are now.

962
01:30:25,044 --> 01:30:26,601
Let's get him up.

963
01:30:32,551 --> 01:30:34,815
It sure wanted to live, didn't it?

964
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:36,750
He'll live now, all right.

965
01:30:46,032 --> 01:30:48,159
Wonder what it feels like to die.

966
01:30:53,672 --> 01:30:55,971
Just stopping breathing, I reckon.

967
01:31:01,614 --> 01:31:03,138
Just going to sleep.

968
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:05,481
I reckon.

969
01:32:11,784 --> 01:32:13,877
I got orders to report
to the home guard.

970
01:32:14,086 --> 01:32:15,883
I came to say goodbye.

971
01:32:16,422 --> 01:32:17,514
Could I see Mattie?

972
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:22,052
She and Little Jess
are down by the swing.

973
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:24,690
Thank you, ma'am.

974
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:34,601
Dance?

975
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:36,334
No, I couldn't.

976
01:32:38,277 --> 01:32:40,677
Oh, well, if you insist.

977
01:32:44,116 --> 01:32:45,344
What?

978
01:32:47,686 --> 01:32:49,313
Thee's doing it again.

979
01:32:49,555 --> 01:32:51,819
Talking to thyself.

980
01:32:52,024 --> 01:32:53,787
I'm not talking to myself.

981
01:32:54,126 --> 01:32:55,821
Is thee talking to Gard Jordon?

982
01:32:57,897 --> 01:33:00,128
He's so brave.

983
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:02,391
Heck!

984
01:33:02,635 --> 01:33:04,762
If he's so "brave"...

985
01:33:05,337 --> 01:33:07,169
...why didn't he win some medals?

986
01:33:08,107 --> 01:33:11,406
Who cares about medals anyway?

987
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:15,043
Gard has a proud and learned face.

988
01:33:15,247 --> 01:33:17,147
A face to remember.

989
01:33:17,349 --> 01:33:19,544
His eyes are the color...

990
01:33:19,752 --> 01:33:20,742
...of the sky...

991
01:33:20,953 --> 01:33:22,683
...in the summer.

992
01:33:23,455 --> 01:33:25,650
It pleasures me just to see him walk.

993
01:33:25,859 --> 01:33:29,090
He walks just like anybody else.

994
01:33:36,468 --> 01:33:38,096
Hello, little Jess.

995
01:33:42,676 --> 01:33:45,873
How'd you like to have
the bullet they took out of my arm?

996
01:33:48,681 --> 01:33:50,774
It's wrong to take bribes.

997
01:33:50,984 --> 01:33:53,315
It's not a bribe. It's a gift.

998
01:33:55,187 --> 01:33:57,178
Thanks. You want a polliwog?

999
01:33:57,389 --> 01:33:58,287
No, thanks.

1000
01:33:58,490 --> 01:33:59,980
Go on, now. Scoot!

1001
01:34:02,729 --> 01:34:04,491
I'm going because I want to.

1002
01:34:07,066 --> 01:34:11,026
- Come on out. I want to talk to you.
- I can't. I'm barefooted.

1003
01:34:11,237 --> 01:34:12,499
What's wrong with that?

1004
01:34:13,172 --> 01:34:15,698
I'm too big a girl
to run around barefooted.

1005
01:34:15,908 --> 01:34:18,604
It mortifies me,
thee seeing me so unlady-like.

1006
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:23,471
Look, I'll shut my eyes...

1007
01:34:23,682 --> 01:34:25,616
...and I'll pretend you have shoes on.

1008
01:34:26,419 --> 01:34:27,646
Come on.

1009
01:34:28,187 --> 01:34:29,712
Or I'll wade in!

1010
01:34:31,323 --> 01:34:34,588
I've got to talk to you.
Come on out, please.

1011
01:34:36,196 --> 01:34:37,753
I'm really nice, you know.

1012
01:34:37,963 --> 01:34:41,160
I've got a nice walk.
And eyes the color of the sky.

1013
01:34:43,535 --> 01:34:45,025
Thee heard?

1014
01:34:45,671 --> 01:34:47,036
Thee heard!

1015
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:50,573
Thee eavesdropped!
Thee thinks I set my cap for thee!

1016
01:34:50,776 --> 01:34:52,607
No, wait! Wait! Please wait!

1017
01:34:52,811 --> 01:34:54,370
I was only joking.

1018
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,308
I never want to see thee again!

1019
01:34:56,515 --> 01:34:58,143
Mattie, wait!

1020
01:35:13,265 --> 01:35:14,824
Good evening, Mr. Birdwell.

1021
01:35:16,568 --> 01:35:18,230
Getting ready to leave us again?

1022
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:21,497
Yes, sir. And I'm reporting
to the home guard tonight.

1023
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:24,400
I came to say goodbye.

1024
01:35:36,089 --> 01:35:38,751
Come on down.
This is no way to treat a guest.

1025
01:35:39,526 --> 01:35:42,791
Would thee please ask him to excuse me?

1026
01:35:47,599 --> 01:35:49,396
I hurt her feelings.

1027
01:35:49,803 --> 01:35:51,794
It's the last thing I wanted to do.

1028
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:55,068
I know how that is.

1029
01:35:55,542 --> 01:35:57,066
I was clumsy.

1030
01:35:57,677 --> 01:36:01,875
With women it's hard
not to be sometimes.

1031
01:36:11,457 --> 01:36:12,550
The rebs are coming!

1032
01:36:13,325 --> 01:36:17,558
Morgan's Raiders have crossed the Ohio.
1500 horsemen burning and pillaging.

1033
01:36:18,098 --> 01:36:22,262
They're 30 miles from Vernon.
This time tomorrow they'll be here!

1034
01:36:22,502 --> 01:36:24,402
No need to shout.

1035
01:36:24,604 --> 01:36:27,470
- Did thee see their patrols?
- No, but I saw what they've done.

1036
01:36:27,674 --> 01:36:31,110
Barns burned, houses looted.
Go towards Vernon and see for thyself.

1037
01:36:31,311 --> 01:36:32,141
Did you see the militia?

1038
01:36:32,345 --> 01:36:36,748
They want every man who can carry a gun.
They figure to make a stand at Vernon.

1039
01:36:37,283 --> 01:36:41,151
Papa, our farm is going to be
overrun for sure!

1040
01:36:41,354 --> 01:36:45,085
That's probably true.
You're on the south side of the river.

1041
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:48,749
You better take your family into the
woods tomorrow till the rebs have gone.

1042
01:36:54,901 --> 01:36:58,234
This is our home.
This is where we'll stay.

1043
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:02,238
Mr. Birdwell, the Raiders don't draw
a line between soldiers and civilians.

1044
01:37:02,442 --> 01:37:06,344
They're the toughest Confederate troops,
and there's no telling what they'll do.

1045
01:37:07,247 --> 01:37:10,648
If they're going to come they're
going to come, like fire or flood.

1046
01:37:10,917 --> 01:37:13,477
If it's the Lord's will,
there's nothing we can do.

1047
01:37:15,422 --> 01:37:17,515
There's something I can do.

1048
01:37:25,732 --> 01:37:27,427
Have you got an extra gun?

1049
01:37:28,768 --> 01:37:30,258
Why, sure, Enoch.

1050
01:37:32,539 --> 01:37:34,666
I hate to cross you like this.

1051
01:37:35,642 --> 01:37:37,234
Don't seem grateful.

1052
01:37:37,777 --> 01:37:39,836
You folks have been mighty kind to me.

1053
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:42,740
But you see, sir,
a runaway slave like me...

1054
01:37:42,949 --> 01:37:45,247
...I wouldn't stand a chance
with those men.

1055
01:37:45,452 --> 01:37:47,147
So if they're going to catch me...

1056
01:37:47,353 --> 01:37:49,481
...I'm going down fighting.

1057
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:55,357
Thee's free.

1058
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:56,993
Free to choose.

1059
01:37:58,264 --> 01:37:59,856
So am I.

1060
01:38:03,604 --> 01:38:04,797
Thee can saddle up Tommy.

1061
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:06,502
Thank you.

1062
01:38:09,443 --> 01:38:10,966
I'll go with thee.

1063
01:38:11,445 --> 01:38:13,503
Without asking us, son?

1064
01:38:14,615 --> 01:38:16,275
There's no need to go now.

1065
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:17,743
Morning's soon enough.

1066
01:38:18,051 --> 01:38:19,518
I'll be in Vernon.

1067
01:38:19,787 --> 01:38:21,310
I'll meet thee there.

1068
01:38:23,923 --> 01:38:26,256
Better talk it over with your folks.

1069
01:38:28,829 --> 01:38:30,489
Tell Mattie goodbye.

1070
01:38:31,097 --> 01:38:35,625
Tell her when I get back, I hope to say
better what I was trying to tell her.

1071
01:38:39,773 --> 01:38:41,501
God bless thee.

1072
01:39:36,796 --> 01:39:38,093
It's true.

1073
01:39:38,298 --> 01:39:41,426
It's true.
Everything thee heard is true!

1074
01:39:41,835 --> 01:39:43,859
Thy walk does pleasure me.

1075
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:45,901
Thy eyes are like summer.

1076
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:49,309
Thee does have a proud, learned face.

1077
01:39:50,177 --> 01:39:51,666
My sweet.

1078
01:39:52,112 --> 01:39:55,012
My dear, sweet, precious girl.

1079
01:39:58,184 --> 01:39:59,777
I love you.

1080
01:40:01,155 --> 01:40:04,181
I love thee. I do love thee!

1081
01:40:09,162 --> 01:40:11,062
Martha True Birdwell...

1082
01:40:11,365 --> 01:40:12,922
...when I come back...

1083
01:40:13,133 --> 01:40:14,691
...will you marry me?

1084
01:40:15,568 --> 01:40:18,504
Will you be my wedded wife
forever and ever?

1085
01:40:20,807 --> 01:40:22,638
Gardiner Jordan...

1086
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:26,673
...I will be thy wedded wife
forever and ever.

1087
01:41:08,289 --> 01:41:09,984
Sit down.

1088
01:41:10,224 --> 01:41:12,590
Thee'll feel better after thee eats.

1089
01:41:12,793 --> 01:41:14,259
I'm not hungry.

1090
01:41:15,396 --> 01:41:17,421
Might make thee a little calmer.

1091
01:41:18,765 --> 01:41:21,393
And a little more courteous
to thy mother.

1092
01:41:22,303 --> 01:41:23,736
Calm?

1093
01:41:24,138 --> 01:41:28,199
Thee asks me to be calm when the whole
of Vernon's getting ready to fight.

1094
01:41:28,409 --> 01:41:31,344
And Morgan's men may
break in here at any minute.

1095
01:41:34,081 --> 01:41:37,380
Father, thee knows we must fight.

1096
01:41:40,988 --> 01:41:43,456
If thee has a sword
in thy heart, son...

1097
01:41:43,657 --> 01:41:45,682
...thee must pull it out and use it.

1098
01:41:45,993 --> 01:41:50,259
But there's no sword in my heart.
No man is my enemy.

1099
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:54,627
Any man who kills innocent people
is my enemy.

1100
01:41:55,402 --> 01:41:57,700
My mortal enemy.

1101
01:42:01,909 --> 01:42:05,401
Thee's seen bad things today.
Thee's upset.

1102
01:42:07,414 --> 01:42:10,872
We've got more than we need here.
It's high time we shared it.

1103
01:42:11,618 --> 01:42:15,520
If thee gives all thee's got to
the enemy, thy friends will go hungry.

1104
01:42:15,723 --> 01:42:17,520
What's good about that?

1105
01:42:21,462 --> 01:42:25,364
Thee wants to go out and fight,
give thy life for what thee believes.

1106
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,267
Any of us here I'm sure
is ready to do that.

1107
01:42:29,536 --> 01:42:32,403
But that's not what
thee'll be asked to do.

1108
01:42:33,807 --> 01:42:36,173
What thee'll be asked to do now...

1109
01:42:37,244 --> 01:42:38,677
...is to kill.

1110
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,341
I know that.

1111
01:42:42,383 --> 01:42:44,544
I'll kill if I have to.

1112
01:42:45,586 --> 01:42:47,713
Thou shalt not kill.

1113
01:42:48,956 --> 01:42:51,288
Mother, I hate fighting.

1114
01:42:51,792 --> 01:42:53,692
I don't want to die.

1115
01:42:53,894 --> 01:42:57,193
I don't know if I could
kill anyone if I tried.

1116
01:42:57,998 --> 01:43:02,458
But I have to try
so long as other people have to.

1117
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:13,769
No, Eliza.

1118
01:43:14,214 --> 01:43:16,079
Don't let him go.

1119
01:43:22,356 --> 01:43:24,881
Don't thee care
about his living or dying?

1120
01:43:25,659 --> 01:43:27,753
I'm just his father...

1121
01:43:27,995 --> 01:43:29,827
...not his conscience.

1122
01:43:31,099 --> 01:43:35,194
A man's life ain't worth beans except
he lives up to his own conscience.

1123
01:43:35,637 --> 01:43:38,298
I've got to give Josh that chance.

1124
01:44:13,373 --> 01:44:15,102
Forever...

1125
01:44:15,309 --> 01:44:17,174
...and forever...

1126
01:44:17,512 --> 01:44:19,480
...and forever.

1127
01:44:45,306 --> 01:44:49,800
Tucking thee in again. How many times
does thee think I've done that?

1128
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:51,603
I don't know.

1129
01:44:54,849 --> 01:44:57,477
I understand thy being carried away.

1130
01:44:57,885 --> 01:44:59,945
But our ways are ways of peace.

1131
01:45:00,154 --> 01:45:02,246
And thee loves peaceful ways.

1132
01:45:02,524 --> 01:45:03,717
I do.

1133
01:45:04,358 --> 01:45:08,295
If thee turns thy back on everything
I've taught thee and prayed for...

1134
01:45:08,662 --> 01:45:10,255
...thee turns thy back on me.

1135
01:45:10,465 --> 01:45:11,954
No, Mother, not on thee.

1136
01:45:12,166 --> 01:45:13,758
Yes, son.

1137
01:45:13,967 --> 01:45:15,094
On me.

1138
01:45:16,237 --> 01:45:18,397
But I have to do what's right.

1139
01:45:18,907 --> 01:45:20,373
Thee will, son.

1140
01:45:20,575 --> 01:45:22,770
God will give thee the strength.

1141
01:45:30,385 --> 01:45:33,786
Dear God in heaven,
watch over Joshua.

1142
01:45:34,555 --> 01:45:37,183
Make him a witness
for the peace on earth...

1143
01:45:37,392 --> 01:45:39,655
...for which Thy Son died.

1144
01:45:41,563 --> 01:45:43,758
In His name do I ask it.

1145
01:45:45,033 --> 01:45:46,523
Amen.

1146
01:45:58,947 --> 01:46:02,439
Before thee sleeps,
promise me thee'll pray.

1147
01:46:03,584 --> 01:46:04,983
I promise.

1148
01:46:10,724 --> 01:46:12,352
Good night, son.

1149
01:46:12,593 --> 01:46:14,721
I have faith in thee.

1150
01:48:00,234 --> 01:48:01,702
Thee promised...

1151
01:48:03,171 --> 01:48:04,433
...to pray.

1152
01:48:06,507 --> 01:48:08,031
I prayed.

1153
01:48:29,197 --> 01:48:30,562
Goodbye, Father.

1154
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:39,229
Goodbye, son.

1155
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:40,965
God bless thee.

1156
01:49:04,933 --> 01:49:06,365
My boy!

1157
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:16,701
God keep thee.

1158
01:49:51,813 --> 01:49:53,441
Company, halt!

1159
01:49:56,552 --> 01:50:00,146
This is the only shallow spot.
They have to cross here.

1160
01:50:04,193 --> 01:50:05,955
All right, men. Dismount!

1161
01:50:07,161 --> 01:50:09,494
Come on, then. Hurry!

1162
01:50:13,268 --> 01:50:14,291
Spread out!

1163
01:50:14,503 --> 01:50:16,094
Find cover!

1164
01:50:43,432 --> 01:50:46,094
Get those horses out of sight! Fast!

1165
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:01,110
Jam a log between those trees!

1166
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:04,913
Get something solid in front of you.
That won't stop a bullet.

1167
01:51:32,547 --> 01:51:35,277
You hold your gun that tight,
by the time the rebs get here...

1168
01:51:35,484 --> 01:51:37,349
...your trigger finger will be numb.

1169
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:56,701
Who gave that rebel yell?

1170
01:51:58,907 --> 01:51:59,874
I did, sir.

1171
01:52:06,481 --> 01:52:08,176
Do it again and I'll shoot you!

1172
01:52:09,351 --> 01:52:11,945
And the same goes for
any other man here!

1173
01:52:50,859 --> 01:52:52,417
Chopping wood?

1174
01:52:55,931 --> 01:52:57,728
We burn wood every winter, Purdy.

1175
01:52:58,367 --> 01:53:00,927
Pretty soon thee'll have no house
to burn wood in.

1176
01:53:01,136 --> 01:53:03,604
Some of Morgan's thieving men
burnt my barn...

1177
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:07,102
...stole my horses
and cleaned out my smokehouse.

1178
01:53:07,342 --> 01:53:09,367
I'm sorry to hear that.

1179
01:53:10,078 --> 01:53:12,274
Thee is welcome to anything I've got.

1180
01:53:12,481 --> 01:53:15,211
No, thanks. If thee wants to help...

1181
01:53:15,485 --> 01:53:17,315
...pick up a gun and fight...

1182
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,385
...the same as I'm doing.

1183
01:53:21,156 --> 01:53:23,090
I'm not ready to do that.

1184
01:53:24,426 --> 01:53:27,657
What does thee aim to do?
Sit here and turn the other cheek?

1185
01:53:28,363 --> 01:53:30,228
That's what I aim to do...

1186
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,230
...if I can.

1187
01:53:32,902 --> 01:53:36,962
Thee's got to face the fact that wartime
calls for another kind of thinking.

1188
01:53:37,172 --> 01:53:40,266
Your thinking may have changed,
but you haven't.

1189
01:53:40,475 --> 01:53:43,377
Last week, you told my son
he'd go to hell for fighting.

1190
01:53:43,578 --> 01:53:45,341
This week you tell Jess to fight.

1191
01:53:45,948 --> 01:53:49,111
Whatever's right for Purdy's got
to be right for everybody else?

1192
01:53:49,317 --> 01:53:51,718
If you're so hell-bent to fight,
get going!

1193
01:53:55,057 --> 01:53:59,858
If it's peace thee wants, Jess Birdwell,
thee won't get it chopping wood.

1194
01:54:11,306 --> 01:54:12,968
Did they hurt thy place?

1195
01:54:13,175 --> 01:54:14,699
No, Jess.

1196
01:54:14,911 --> 01:54:18,677
Just thought I'd ride toward the river,
see how the boys are getting on.

1197
01:54:20,449 --> 01:54:23,317
One more man at the fort
won't make a hoot of difference.

1198
01:54:23,518 --> 01:54:27,614
If there's any fighting to be done,
I'll do it for both of us.

1199
01:54:29,524 --> 01:54:33,153
I'd like to see someone hold out
for a better way of settling things.

1200
01:55:41,264 --> 01:55:42,697
They're coming!

1201
01:57:14,423 --> 01:57:15,913
What was that all about?

1202
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:17,352
Get down.

1203
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:19,790
You'll find out sooner than you think.

1204
01:58:33,703 --> 01:58:34,568
Fire!

1205
02:00:01,424 --> 02:00:02,652
It's Lady!

1206
02:00:05,996 --> 02:00:07,520
Look, Papa!

1207
02:00:20,776 --> 02:00:22,335
Is Josh hurt?

1208
02:00:38,661 --> 02:00:40,720
Bring Lady to the house.

1209
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:21,927
Jess, no!

1210
02:02:01,211 --> 02:02:04,408
Little Jess, thee's the man
on the place now.

1211
02:02:07,851 --> 02:02:10,445
IKill a Johnny Reb for me.

1212
02:02:13,723 --> 02:02:16,385
Never talk that way
about a man's life.

1213
02:03:10,948 --> 02:03:12,710
Mama, look!

1214
02:03:26,497 --> 02:03:28,088
They're rebs, they're rebs!

1215
02:03:56,493 --> 02:03:57,892
Gentlemen!

1216
02:03:58,495 --> 02:03:59,519
Gentlemen!

1217
02:04:01,064 --> 02:04:02,589
Would thee like some food?

1218
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:05,699
There's meat in the
smokehouse by the barn.

1219
02:04:05,903 --> 02:04:08,063
Right. Stevens, get those chickens!

1220
02:04:08,271 --> 02:04:09,739
I'll get all them chickens.

1221
02:04:09,973 --> 02:04:13,466
Fresh vegetables and fruit and more meat
are in the spring house there.

1222
02:04:14,077 --> 02:04:16,273
Buster, Clem, go get it.

1223
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:17,447
You bet, boss.

1224
02:04:17,681 --> 02:04:21,948
Cooked food's in the kitchen. If thee
and thy men will please follow me.

1225
02:04:25,823 --> 02:04:27,380
Yes, ma'am!

1226
02:04:28,725 --> 02:04:29,818
Take these horses!

1227
02:05:06,363 --> 02:05:07,830
Boys, give me a hand.

1228
02:05:09,399 --> 02:05:10,867
Roast goose tonight.

1229
02:05:11,068 --> 02:05:12,433
Go get him, Buster.

1230
02:05:19,977 --> 02:05:21,671
Peach pie!

1231
02:05:24,415 --> 02:05:26,746
It's rattlesnake pie.

1232
02:05:27,118 --> 02:05:29,678
Best rattlesnake pie I ever tasted.

1233
02:05:40,698 --> 02:05:42,666
Stop it! Let her go!

1234
02:05:44,234 --> 02:05:45,395
Let her go!

1235
02:05:45,602 --> 02:05:48,470
Stop it! Let her go!
Let her go! Stop!

1236
02:05:55,112 --> 02:05:56,442
Samantha's a pet!

1237
02:05:56,647 --> 02:05:58,012
She's a pure pet!

1238
02:05:59,115 --> 02:06:01,380
I wish I'd knowed that sooner.

1239
02:06:11,128 --> 02:06:12,959
Much obliged, ma'am.

1240
02:06:18,536 --> 02:06:20,026
Thank you very kindly, lady.

1241
02:06:20,237 --> 02:06:21,829
Feel much better.

1242
02:06:22,305 --> 02:06:23,533
Mount up!

1243
02:06:25,075 --> 02:06:28,272
Boys, there's enough food here
to feed us for a whole week!

1244
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:39,385
Thanks for the chickens!

1245
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,468
I raised my hand in anger.

1246
02:06:52,703 --> 02:06:53,795
I struck.

1247
02:06:54,004 --> 02:06:56,165
What a whacking!

1248
02:06:58,776 --> 02:07:01,005
If thy father ever knew...

1249
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:04,045
Thee must never tell him.

1250
02:07:04,248 --> 02:07:05,510
Never!

1251
02:07:38,849 --> 02:07:40,680
Whoa, Black Prince.

1252
02:08:32,269 --> 02:08:33,897
Sam, what happ...?

1253
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:36,606
Reb Bushwhacker.

1254
02:08:36,807 --> 02:08:38,035
He took...

1255
02:08:39,176 --> 02:08:40,700
...Black Prince.

1256
02:08:41,178 --> 02:08:42,577
I found him.

1257
02:08:44,916 --> 02:08:46,439
Head for war...

1258
02:08:46,650 --> 02:08:49,642
...and get mixed up with horse thieves.

1259
02:08:51,655 --> 02:08:54,089
I was training Black Prince...

1260
02:08:55,626 --> 02:08:56,888
...to beat you.

1261
02:08:59,897 --> 02:09:01,797
Thee can beat me, Sam.

1262
02:09:02,766 --> 02:09:05,234
Thee can beat me any day in the week.

1263
02:09:07,204 --> 02:09:09,229
You finally admit it.

1264
02:09:15,446 --> 02:09:17,711
Tell him when you see him.

1265
02:09:21,251 --> 02:09:22,741
I'll tell him.

1266
02:09:31,495 --> 02:09:32,860
I'll tell him.

1267
02:11:23,207 --> 02:11:24,470
Now, go on.

1268
02:11:35,253 --> 02:11:36,618
Go on, git!

1269
02:11:36,820 --> 02:11:38,448
I'll not harm thee.

1270
02:13:21,125 --> 02:13:22,650
Thank God I found thee.

1271
02:13:29,034 --> 02:13:31,025
He's not very old.

1272
02:13:39,445 --> 02:13:41,105
I killed him.

1273
02:13:42,247 --> 02:13:44,580
Thee did what thee had to do.

1274
02:13:44,983 --> 02:13:47,008
I must get thee home.

1275
02:14:43,842 --> 02:14:47,141
I heard thee playing on the Lord's Day...

1276
02:14:49,014 --> 02:14:50,537
Let me look at thee.

1277
02:14:57,021 --> 02:14:58,614
Stand still.

1278
02:14:58,824 --> 02:15:01,018
Let me see if thee
is in order for Meeting.

1279
02:15:01,226 --> 02:15:03,717
Stay on the porch and keep clean!

1280
02:15:05,731 --> 02:15:07,790
I don't need any help, thank thee.

1281
02:15:08,934 --> 02:15:11,630
But it pleasures me to help thee, son.

1282
02:15:13,237 --> 02:15:15,102
Do I pass inspection?

1283
02:15:17,276 --> 02:15:19,573
Yes, Jess. Thee'll pass.

1284
02:15:20,746 --> 02:15:22,303
My Bible.

1285
02:15:26,684 --> 02:15:29,346
Come on, Samantha. Come on, pet.

1286
02:15:36,729 --> 02:15:38,594
What's come over that bird?

1287
02:15:38,797 --> 02:15:41,823
Little Jess has stopped
being mean to her, that's all.

1288
02:15:43,534 --> 02:15:44,729
That's all, huh?

1289
02:15:44,936 --> 02:15:47,633
Samantha's the one that was mean.
Till that reb...

1290
02:15:48,374 --> 02:15:50,034
Thee's not my boss!

1291
02:15:50,242 --> 02:15:51,834
Hush up, thee!

1292
02:15:53,078 --> 02:15:54,943
A reb grabbed Saman...

1293
02:15:55,481 --> 02:15:57,141
And he was wringing her neck...

1294
02:16:00,552 --> 02:16:03,543
Mama whacked him over the head
with a broom until he let...

1295
02:16:03,756 --> 02:16:05,587
Until he let her go.

1296
02:16:08,861 --> 02:16:10,657
Mama? Whacked a reb?

1297
02:16:10,863 --> 02:16:12,125
She sure did!

1298
02:16:12,331 --> 02:16:13,992
With that broom.

1299
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:24,008
By sugar, that's news!

1300
02:16:30,783 --> 02:16:32,876
Looks like thee needs a new broom.

1301
02:16:33,085 --> 02:16:34,074
Why, Jess?

1302
02:16:34,286 --> 02:16:36,311
This one's seen lots of service.

1303
02:16:39,792 --> 02:16:42,259
I tried to stop him.

1304
02:16:44,163 --> 02:16:46,290
She shook it out of me.

1305
02:16:51,904 --> 02:16:53,633
Come on, veterans.

1306
02:17:09,688 --> 02:17:11,212
Good morning, Enoch.
