1
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:53,722
End of song, beginning of story.

2
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:10,064
Man, dig that crazy rehearsal hall.

3
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:13,568
What a powerful pile of rock.
I can't go in there.

4
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:17,570
- Why can't you go in there?
- I ain't got my library card.

5
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,900
Dig you.

6
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:23,411
- Are you the musicians?
- That's what the man said.

7
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:27,246
- What name shall I say?
- Tell Dex old Satchelmouth.

8
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,336
Will you please follow me,
Mr. Satchelmouth?

9
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:35,581
Wipe your feet, boys. Something
tells me we've got a long walk ahead.

10
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,593
Hey, pops! How's the chops?
Good to see you, boy!

11
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:47,260
Hey, fellas!
How's everything?

12
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:50,309
You've been all over
Europe since I saw you.

13
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:51,763
- Did you go to Sweden?
- Yes.

14
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,268
<i>- Skol.</i>
- I was the <i>skol-</i> est cat ever.

15
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:58,395
I bet you were. Here it is, fellas.
Just lay it out here.

16
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:01,244
I never thought you lived
in a big house.

17
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,530
Shows what happens when your
grandfather's a robber baron.

18
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,454
- You can play football in here.
- But can you rehearse?

19
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:12,291
- Is the chandelier tied tight?
- If it swings, put a mute in your horn.

20
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:15,037
Pardon me.
The ladies are waiting in the library.

21
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:16,675
Vamp a little, will you?

22
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,301
- Okay, Dex.
- All right.

23
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:21,044
Ladies?

24
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,467
- Dexter.
- Hello, Ruth.

25
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,096
Thanks for letting the
musicians rehearse here.

26
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:27,474
- Tickled to death.
- You saved the festival.

27
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,187
As long as I can save you.

28
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:30,553
- Hello, Helen.
- Save us?

29
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,935
You know you might lose
your billing in the blue book?

30
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,818
Jazz is considered very unchic.

31
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:37,529
Oh, I'm sure we'll love it.

32
00:05:37,697 --> 00:05:39,357
Let us know if we can help.

33
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,525
I will. Thanks a lot for coming by.

34
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:43,528
- Thank you.
- We'll keep in touch.

35
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:45,945
- You bet. Bye.
- Bye.

36
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:51,324
- Hello?
- Hello, Dexter?

37
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:54,539
- This is Caroline.
- Hello, beautiful.

38
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,173
Any time now.

39
00:06:03,181 --> 00:06:05,090
Where's Tracy?
I've been yelling for her.

40
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,555
You don't yell, Caroline.
You call a person.

41
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:09,803
You yell if you're in pain.

42
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:13,430
Well, this wedding gives me a pain.

43
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,765
I think Tracy was awful
mean to divorce Dexter.

44
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,142
Can I have this?

45
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:21,939
Oh, and take those presents
over to the other table.

46
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:25,367
Mother, Tracy's sort of hard, isn't she?

47
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:29,036
Not hard. None of my children are
that, I hope. The goblets too.

48
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:32,207
Tracy's just exceptionally
strong-minded.

49
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:35,662
And very wonderful always.

50
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,881
I wish something would
happen around here.

51
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,671
Nothing definitely ever happens here.

52
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:44,216
Out of the way, angel.
You'll get stepped on.

53
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:47,888
So far, I've received 24 nut dishes
and 16 silver ice picks.

54
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:51,759
That should give you an idea of what
people think of your next husband.

55
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:57,228
Mother, don't you think Caroline's old
enough to go to a good military school?

56
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:00,646
- What's this?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

57
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:03,395
- It stinks.
- Don't say stinks, darling.

58
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:09,245
If absolutely necessary, "smells,"
but only if absolutely necessary.

59
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,700
If you put this picture in my
wedding presents once more...

60
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,161
...I'm going to personally
chain you to your bed.

61
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,793
Why, what is it, dear?

62
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:23,757
- He was handsome.
- Don't talk of him as if he were dead.

63
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:25,506
Well, he is dead to me.

64
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,760
And if that picture turns up once more,
it's going right in the ashcan.

65
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,179
Well, look at this.

66
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:34,057
- Wow. Jewels.
- From Father.

67
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,510
Isn't it pretty?

68
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,766
His girlfriend probably turned it down.

69
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:41,145
- That's not fair to your father.
- How can you defend him?

70
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,945
A common chorus girl.

71
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:46,483
She's not a chorus girl.
She's quite a talented ballet dancer.

72
00:07:47,618 --> 00:07:51,283
Isn't it stinking of Tracy
not to invite Father to the wedding?

73
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:54,456
Yes, Caroline. Just between us,
it's good and stinking.

74
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,954
Me too.

75
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:59,496
Oh, darling, why don't you
face facts squarely as I did?

76
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:03,966
We might face the fact that neither
of us has been a great success as a wife.

77
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:07,967
We both took the only stand a woman
could take and keep her self-respect.

78
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,799
- Yes, dear.
- The Hammonds.

79
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:13,473
And now I have my self-respect
and no husband.

80
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:16,811
- Oh, we're both better off. Believe me.
- Yes, dear.

81
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:19,057
- And we're both happier.
- Yes, dear.

82
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,187
- Oh, isn't George an angel?
- Yes, George is an angel.

83
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:25,481
- Now, is he handsome, or is he not?
- George is handsome.

84
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:28,527
Golly Moses, I'm a lucky girl.

85
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:35,363
Tracy, that's your song.
Dexter must be home.

86
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,415
Mother, has Dexter come back?

87
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:41,286
Well, we knew Dexter was giving
his house over to this festival.

88
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:43,338
I suppose he might have come back.

89
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:46,508
He's back. No one but Dexter
would play that song.

90
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:50,260
That wretched, cheap, vulgar song.

91
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:55,224
That beautiful, wonderful song
he wrote especially for her.

92
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:57,720
That's gratitude.

93
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:26,789
He's gonna get nowhere
with that kind of music.

94
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:29,755
Good for the feet,
nothing for the heart.

95
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,547
Hello, Sam.

96
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,550
I'd like to talk to you privately.

97
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:38,141
Well, now, I consider that
right neighborly.

98
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:41,774
You lost a little weight,
haven't you, Sam?

99
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,728
Oh, no, you're slipping.
That used to scare me.

100
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:46,978
The withering glance of the goddess.

101
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:50,903
I just want to know what you are
doing here the day before my wedding.

102
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:53,696
Business. I've become a
distinguished composer...

103
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,901
Oh, distinguished.

104
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:57,914
They needed help here,
so I heeded the call of duty.

105
00:09:58,082 --> 00:09:59,742
Don't pretend with me, Dexter.

106
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:03,785
You deliberately planned this
festival to conflict with my wedding.

107
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:06,917
It's a shabby, vindictive gesture.

108
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:11,303
Harsh words. Well, let's be honest.
I'll admit it. I'm still in love with you.

109
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,922
I don't want you to get married.
You can still be a wonderful woman.

110
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:19,144
- I haven't the same high hopes for you.
- I don't wanna be a wonderful woman.

111
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:22,763
Isn't it enough you almost spoiled my life
without spoiling my wedding?

112
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,309
- I didn't try to spoil your life, Sam.
- And stop calling me Sam.

113
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:29,440
I know you didn't try to spoil mine,
but you called the shots.

114
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:32,187
You were dictating the fellow
you wanted me to be.

115
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,486
With your background
and taste and intelligence...

116
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:39,611
...you could have become a
serious composer, or a diplomat...

117
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,460
...or anything you wanted to be.

118
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:47,039
And what have you become?
A jukebox hero?

119
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,587
Well, is that bad?

120
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,709
Dexter, be satisfied and let me alone.

121
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:56,379
Go away. Go away and stay away.

122
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:58,431
I tried to. I even wanted to.

123
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:02,930
But I guess I'm just a weak character.
I'm still in love with you.

124
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:11,319
Dexter?

125
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,481
Oh, hello, honey.

126
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:18,323
- I don't think your sister likes me.
- I do.

127
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:20,535
Thanks, sweetie.

128
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:23,458
What do you suppose
she sees in George anyway?

129
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:27,671
I don't know. Tracy just
likes character, I guess.

130
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,674
I don't think George
has so much character.

131
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:35,005
Now, I hate to admit it, but I think
she's made a pretty good choice.

132
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:39,047
I expect some day to see George Kittredge
president of Redfern Coal.

133
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:43,388
That's not hard.
Father's president of Redfern Coal.

134
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:45,021
Let's be fair now, honey.

135
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:49,057
Takes a lot of character to start at
the bottom and work your way up.

136
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:51,773
If you start at the bottom
of a coal mine...

137
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:54,188
...and worked your way to the top...

138
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,322
...you'd still only be on the ground.

139
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:59,363
Little one, you've brought
up an interesting point.

140
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:03,369
Why does he always have to walk
like he owned the world?

141
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:06,080
And the way he stiffs the air?

142
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:08,079
Like he was looking for breakfast.

143
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:11,753
For a minute there, I thought
you were George Kittredge himself.

144
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:14,083
No, you're Caroline.

145
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,635
Hi.

146
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,268
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hello, handsome.

147
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:26,897
- Did you miss me?
- Miserably.

148
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:29,104
- You happy now?
- Ecstatic.

149
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,813
Didn't expect to find
you coming from the garden.

150
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:36,399
Dexter's back. He's turned his
house over to those musicians.

151
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:39,575
Yes, I know.
The posters are all over town.

152
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:43,991
George? You don't really
mind him, do you?

153
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:46,241
Dexter? Well, how do you mean?

154
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,952
Well, I mean, the fact of him.

155
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:52,086
I still don't understand, dear.

156
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:55,043
You know, that he was...

157
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:59,050
Well, my lord and master.

158
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:01,713
No one has ever been
your lord and master.

159
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:03,469
Until now.

160
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:09,892
Poor Dexter is the sort of man whose
inheritance robbed him of his heritage.

161
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:13,565
He never earned you, so how could
he be expected to appreciate you?

162
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:17,187
- George, you're so good for me.
- I hope so.

163
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,400
Dexter?

164
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,651
Are you ever gonna
get married again?

165
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:25,991
Sure I am. But I'm waiting
for you to grow up.

166
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:29,250
- Dexter, for you I'll hurry.
- Yes, you're gonna have to.

167
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:33,547
I wouldn't have acted the way Tracy did
when you published your song about her.

168
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:37,664
- I wish you'd write a song about me.
- Would you like that? Really?

169
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:41,378
Well, we ought to be able
to whip something up here.

170
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:14,065
Dexter, that was beautiful.
I consider us engaged.

171
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:54,302
Right song, but the wrong girl.

172
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:05,822
Hello? Oh, hello,
Willie, I'm glad you called.

173
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:09,610
Cousin Martha just phoned.
She wants me to give you lunch.

174
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:12,278
She wants you out of the house.

175
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:13,867
Well, where are you?

176
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:18,205
I'm in the office
of the editor of <i>SPY</i> magazine.

177
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:23,041
No, no, no.
Spy. It rhymes with lie.

178
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:31,303
Right. Now, he wants to send a couple
of reporters up to cover Tracy's wedding.

179
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:33,634
Now, don't explode, my dear.

180
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:38,520
I have just read an article right
here on the editor's desk...

181
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:41,894
...about your husband and that dancer.

182
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,651
You know.

183
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,697
But it's blackmail.
Beside, Tracy would never allow it.

184
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:53,162
Now, if you will allow
a reporter and a photographer...

185
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,703
...into your home to
cover Tracy's wedding...

186
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,291
...I have the editor's word
as a gentleman...

187
00:16:59,462 --> 00:17:04,338
...that he will withhold
the article on your husband.

188
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:08,091
All right, Willie,
I suppose we have no choice.

189
00:17:08,513 --> 00:17:11,348
Tracy'll hit the ceiling.

190
00:17:11,516 --> 00:17:13,307
Goodbye.

191
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:15,759
Mother!

192
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:20,769
George came early. I'll tell Edward
to set another place for lunch.

193
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:23,563
- I'm pooped.
- No, dear, you're enervated.

194
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:25,361
I'm pooped too.

195
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,649
There is one thing
I want understood right now.

196
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:32,739
No member of my family is to
invite Dexter-Haven into this house...

197
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:35,617
...until after I am married and gone.

198
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,910
I will not have my wedding
spoiled by intruders.

199
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:40,828
- Tracy.
- Yes?

200
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:45,381
I'm afraid we'll have to endure
a couple of intruders.

201
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:48,586
I've just talked to Uncle Willie.

202
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:52,426
Uncle Willie's an evil old man.
Did he invite a couple painted ladies?

203
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:56,050
Please, Caroline. Run along, dear.

204
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:57,935
And roll down your trousers.

205
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:02,148
Your Uncle Willie wants us to
have a photographer and reporter...

206
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:05,935
...from <i>SPY</i> magazine cover your wedding.

207
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:10,193
Is he out of his mind?

208
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:14,827
Intimate pictures of my wedding
in that barbershop magazine?

209
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:16,704
He can't be serious.

210
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:19,411
He's quite serious.
If we don't allow them...

211
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:23,628
...this magazine will publish a rather
unsavory article about your father.

212
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:26,833
Good. I couldn't be happier.
It serves him right.

213
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:28,383
You mustn't be vindictive.

214
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:31,587
As Uncle Willie points out,
you'll only make George suffer.

215
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:34,966
You owe it to him to suppress
this if you possibly can.

216
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:40,811
And I'm to be examined, undressed and
generally humiliated at 15 cents a copy?

217
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,815
- No.
- Have some compassion, Tracy.

218
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:48,645
But this is intolerable. The idea
of letting Father off scot-free.

219
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:53,699
No, I won't do it. And in
our house, watching every move.

220
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:57,616
Why, jotting down notes on how we sit
and talk and eat and move...

221
00:18:57,788 --> 00:19:00,326
...just to save Father's face, no.

222
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,243
- Tracy...
- No!

223
00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:04,790
For me, please?

224
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:08,712
Mother, I really think you're
sorry you ever let Father go.

225
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:12,501
For George and for me, Tracy.

226
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:19,556
Oh, all right.
I can't stand seeing you hurt.

227
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:22,225
Thank you, dear.

228
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:31,647
All right. Let them send their spies.

229
00:19:31,823 --> 00:19:34,111
- I'll give them a story.
- Now, Tracy.

230
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:40,119
I'll give them a slant on Newport home
life that will stand their hair on end.

231
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:44,619
Tracy, promise me you'll behave
like a lady in front of these creatures.

232
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:46,538
I promise.

233
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:11,687
Looks like the sort of place
where treaties are signed.

234
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:13,025
Or wars declared.

235
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:15,771
Maybe we should have gone
to the service entrance.

236
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,108
Maybe this is the service entrance.

237
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:22,948
I don't understand how the Lords ever
got talked into letting us come down here.

238
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:24,748
It's publicity, they love it.

239
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:27,539
It's a wonder they didn't roll
out the red carpet.

240
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:32,006
- Mike, I don't like this assignment.
- Neither do I, Liz, but I like to eat.

241
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:37,176
How do you do?
I think we're expected.

242
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:40,431
Mike Connor and Miss Imbrie.
We're from <i>SPY</i> magazine.

243
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,677
I'll tell Mrs. Lord you're here.
Please wait in the south parlor.

244
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:52,689
- "The south parlor."
- But of course.

245
00:20:56,991 --> 00:21:00,609
The family will be here
directly to welcome you.

246
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:03,612
I wonder what with.

247
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:07,950
- The south parlor.
- That's right.

248
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:12,248
Would you have four footmen
bring me a large ashtray, please?

249
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:17,583
Mike, be careful what you say.
We may be wired for sound.

250
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:20,383
They couldn't pay me to
live in a joint like this.

251
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:23,261
You know, they won't.

252
00:21:23,768 --> 00:21:26,852
I'd have more respect for this
dame if she'd throw us out.

253
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:29,477
Don't make snap judgments.

254
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:32,270
You were wrong about me,
remember?

255
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,603
Yeah.

256
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:38,364
Hey, Liz.

257
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:41,149
Look at that loot that they collected.

258
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:45,159
Wow. They must run a hockshop
on the side.

259
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:51,625
What's the matter?

260
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:54,169
The joint's full of spies.

261
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,498
That ought to make us feel at home.

262
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:59,167
Move over.

263
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:01,968
Thank you.

264
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:05,974
Look at this, Liz. All the comforts.

265
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:11,600
Lousy with phones. South parlor,
sunroom, terrace, pool, stables. Stables?

266
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:14,609
I always knew horses could talk.

267
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:17,606
Mike, don't!

268
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:22,324
- Yes?
<i>- This is the voice of doom.</i>

269
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:24,367
What?

270
00:22:25,371 --> 00:22:29,120
This is to tell you your days are numbered.

271
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:33,702
Hello? Oh, dear.

272
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,999
One of the servants has been
at the sherry again.

273
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:41,215
Look, Huckleberry, you'll get us tossed
out of here before we get a story.

274
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:42,881
Stop worrying.

275
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:46,092
You just watch the old master
put them through the loops.

276
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:48,639
I'll watch, professor.

277
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:52,022
I assume these are
the Seth Lord ancestors.

278
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,309
There certainly can be no
other reason for hanging them.

279
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:57,941
Can't say they look very bright.

280
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,152
Inbreeding. Always produces idiots.

281
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:02,778
Here. Open this.

282
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:16,921
How do you do? I believe you're
the lady and gentleman from the press.

283
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:18,714
I am Caroline Lord.

284
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:24,168
Well, I'm Elizabeth Imbrie
and this is Mr. Macaulay Connor.

285
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,182
I spoke French before I spoke English.

286
00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:35,683
My early childhood was spent in Paris,
where my father worked in a bank.

287
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:37,732
The House of Morgan.

288
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:40,773
- You don't say.
- Yes, I do say.

289
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:46,034
Can you play the piano?
I can.

290
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:51,243
I shall play and sing
at the same time.

291
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:40,122
How do you do?
I'm Tracy Lord.

292
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,040
You must be... Oh, of course, you are.

293
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:48,173
I adore strangers.

294
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:51,432
Do sit down, please.

295
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:52,799
That sister of yours...

296
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:57,639
Isn't she a dear? And so talented. But
we're afraid she has a homicidal streak.

297
00:24:57,815 --> 00:25:01,101
- Did you get lost finding us?
- No. We had good directions.

298
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:03,733
I hope you don't mind
our being here.

299
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:06,146
Oh, but I'm delighted.
We have so much cake.

300
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:09,241
- What is your name, dear?
- No, thank you.

301
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,984
I'm so sensitive to names.

302
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:14,701
My name is Elizabeth Imbrie.

303
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:17,579
Elizabeth Imbrie.

304
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:23,292
It sounds like a medieval saint who
was burned to death. And you?

305
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:25,008
I'm Mike Connor.

306
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:29,637
Michael. What a lovely musical name.
Now, you mustn't be ashamed of it.

307
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:31,383
I'm not. Mike is for Macaulay.

308
00:25:31,557 --> 00:25:33,882
And what's the Macaulay for?

309
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,393
My father taught English history.
My friends call me Mike.

310
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:40,315
Of whom you have many, I'm sure.

311
00:25:40,483 --> 00:25:43,353
English history has
always fascinated me.

312
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:46,943
Cromwell and Robin Hood.

313
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:49,570
And Jack the Ripper. Where did he teach?

314
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:53,692
- Your father, I mean.
- South Bend, Indiana.

315
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:57,999
South Bend. It sounds
like dancing, doesn't it?

316
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,623
You must have had a most
happy childhood there.

317
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:02,955
- It was screams.
- I'm so glad.

318
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:05,130
- I didn't mean it that way.
- Sorry.

319
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:07,209
It's a natural mistake.

320
00:26:07,385 --> 00:26:10,551
- Are you the photographer or the...?
- I take pictures.

321
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:15,882
Great art. Did you bring your Brownie?
You must be sort of a writer, Mr. Connor.

322
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,183
- Sort of, yes.
- Have I read your novels?

323
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:19,385
I doubt it.

324
00:26:19,564 --> 00:26:21,852
- I haven't written any.
- But you must.

325
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:25,725
Why, Mozart composed at 13.
You must be at least 30.

326
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:29,901
Time is flying. Where were you born,
Miss Imbrie?

327
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:32,743
- Duluth.
- Duluth.

328
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,697
- That's west of here, isn't it?
- Sort of.

329
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:38,327
But we occasionally get
the eastern breezes.

330
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:42,034
- Are you two going together?
- Now, look, Miss Lord.

331
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:46,505
- That's an odd question, I must say.
- I don't see why. I think it's fascinating.

332
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,465
Like birds in spring. It's...

333
00:26:48,634 --> 00:26:52,928
Well, it's the sort of intimate detail you
like to write about, isn't it, Mr. Connor?

334
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:56,015
But if you'd rather not have
your privacy invaded...

335
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:59,138
...I will certainly respect your wishes.
Please.

336
00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:02,811
If you'll excuse me, I'll see
what's keeping Mama.

337
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:05,520
Mama is so eager to see you.

338
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:07,271
Mama?

339
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:14,783
You know, professor, I think you
dropped a loop.

340
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:20,325
- She can't be for real.
- Who was doing the interviewing?

341
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,494
- Do you think she was born that way?
- No. Takes years.

342
00:27:26,797 --> 00:27:28,956
I know we're being taken for a ride.

343
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:32,051
Well, if we are, let's enjoy the scenery.

344
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,129
I'm scared. I wanna go home.

345
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:38,172
Mama. Mama, this is
Miss Imbrie of Duluth...

346
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:42,479
...and the young man she goes with at
<i>SPY</i> magazine, Mr. Mike Macaulay Connor.

347
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:45,648
- He's the son of an English teacher.
- How do you do?

348
00:27:45,817 --> 00:27:47,643
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Not at all.

349
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:50,654
- We enjoyed the floor show.
- You must mean Caroline.

350
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:53,732
Well, then, you've met us all,
haven't you?

351
00:27:53,832 --> 00:27:54,939
Except Mr. Lord.

352
00:27:56,452 --> 00:27:58,659
Look at the pretty way she does her hair.

353
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,747
- It's lovely. Is it lacquered?
- No.

354
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:07,159
- Will Mr. Lord be here for the wedding?
- We're about to have lunch. Join us.

355
00:28:07,338 --> 00:28:10,339
- Thank you.
- Good. I'll tell Edward.

356
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:15,134
We wondered about Mr. Lord
because I was hoping to be able to get...

357
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:18,839
- We wondered about Mr. Lord...
- We usually have box lunches on the lawn.

358
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,342
But today it's sit-down.
Come to the garden.

359
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,975
- Do you like your sherry dry or sweet?
- Scotch on the rocks.

360
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:29,642
George, Mr. Connor of <i>SPY</i> magazine.
He's going to cover our wedding.

361
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:30,898
How do you do?

362
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,941
- And Miss Imbrie of Duluth.
- How do you do?

363
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:37,531
Splendid. I'm a great admirer
of your magazine, Mr. Connor.

364
00:28:37,702 --> 00:28:39,410
Really? Why?

365
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:43,623
It has its finger on the pulse of the public
and its ear to the ground.

366
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,033
That's a vulnerable position,
don't you think?

367
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,286
I asked Edward to set two extra places.

368
00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:51,214
Make it three. Hello, sweetheart!

369
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:54,923
- Who he?
- This is Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor...

370
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:57,170
...from <i>SPY</i> magazine.
<i>- SPY?</i>

371
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,051
Your tastes have changed a little,
haven't they, Sam?

372
00:29:00,224 --> 00:29:02,217
- Sam?
- Her middle name's Samantha.

373
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,267
- She hates it. Hi.
- Hi.

374
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:09,229
Isn't it time for your milk
and arsenic, darling?

375
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:14,026
Are you the same Dexter-Haven
that wrote a song called "Samantha"?

376
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:17,482
And unless I'm mistaken,
weren't you once married to Miss Lord?

377
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:20,825
- Guilty on both counts.
- I remember. Two years ago.

378
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:23,153
Elopement, headlines,
divorce, headlines...

379
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:26,865
...and now you're back for the wedding?
- I'm here for this jazz festival...

380
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:29,748
...but I expect to pitch a little rice
on the side.

381
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:32,079
Mr. Haven has become
quite famous since our divorce.

382
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:36,752
Undoubtedly you know of his
piano concerto "Choo Choo Mama."

383
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:38,671
Yes, I know it very well.

384
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:41,135
Tell me, how did you
and Mr. Kittredge meet?

385
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:43,264
Heaven brought them together.

386
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:45,806
My father took me to inspect
one of his mines...

387
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:48,220
...and Mr. Kittredge was there
to guide us.

388
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:51,315
- How romantic.
- Yes, they met in a hole in the ground.

389
00:29:51,484 --> 00:29:54,900
We're all very friendly.
It's the only civilized way to behave.

390
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:58,938
Could I have a picture of the bride
between her first and second husband?

391
00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:00,776
Really, I don't... Darling...

392
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:02,825
Is something like this thrilling?

393
00:30:02,995 --> 00:30:05,569
May the two gentlemen
look at each other?

394
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,245
You don't look as well
as the last time I saw you.

395
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:09,876
Ready?

396
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:15,172
You've got a lot on your mind.
But it's too late to back out, old boy.

397
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:18,378
- They grew up together.
- Miss Lord...

398
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:21,803
...would you look at your first husband
in this one, please?

399
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:30,142
You don't look old enough
to marry anybody. You never did.

400
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:31,857
Ready?

401
00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:35,313
- One more, please.
- Naturally.

402
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:38,772
She needs trouble to mature, Kittredge.
Give her a lot of it.

403
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:43,112
- I'm afraid she can't count on me for that.
- That's a pity. I gave her plenty.

404
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:44,317
Ready?

405
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:47,330
Mr. Kittredge, could you smile?
You're the groom, you know.

406
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,326
- There. Thank you.
- Good.

407
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:53,543
Miss Lord, please lift your chin.

408
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,503
I thought I was sticking it out.

409
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:04,555
Say, that's some rock you got there, Sam.
Did you mine that yourself, George?

410
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:07,346
Father sent her a diamond necklace.

411
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:11,302
Yes, when will I be able to get a picture
of the family united with Mr. Lord?

412
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:16,189
- My husband loathes publicity.
- He will be here a little later, won't he?

413
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:19,982
Papa!

414
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:24,650
Papa. It's Papa!

415
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:28,611
- Oh, capital, it's Papa!
- Dear Papa, you came at last.

416
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:31,541
Papa? Have you by any chance
slipped a cog?

417
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:34,282
Uncle Willie, for the time being,
you have to be Father.

418
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:36,917
- Why?
- I shall explain later.

419
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:40,090
- Look, it's Papa!
- It's Papa!

420
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,967
- It's Papa.
- Yes.

421
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:44,710
Tell Edward to set another place for lunch.

422
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:47,427
- You're looking clever today, Papa.
- Thank you.

423
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,016
- Papa, this is Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor.
- They're from <i>SPY.</i>

424
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:55,896
Spy? Yes, of course, the magazine.
I believe I know your editor.

425
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:58,772
- Dreadful fellow.
- He's wretched.

426
00:31:59,362 --> 00:32:03,229
Papa, these two charming people
were beginning to doubt your existence.

427
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:05,032
Well, imagine that.

428
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,865
Father of the bride.
We'll use it to head the article.

429
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:10,616
I'm afraid you got my bad side.

430
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:15,119
- I'm sure you have no bad side, Mr. Lord.
- I like her.

431
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:17,453
Now, I'll have a drink, if I may.

432
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:25,506
How clumsy of me. I could die.

433
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:28,799
- I'll bet it's ruined.
- I'd like a piece of your bet.

434
00:32:28,975 --> 00:32:31,430
- Is it broken?
- Probably.

435
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:33,928
- Whatever will you do?
- I carry a spare.

436
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:37,059
- Luncheon is served.
- Thank you, Edward.

437
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:40,187
Shall we go in?
We're all famished, I'm sure.

438
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:41,986
- Bring your drinks.
- Sweetie.

439
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:44,942
- I haven't got a drink.
- Have some schnapps, Pops.

440
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:47,903
When you look at this wonderful family...

441
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:50,236
...do you wonder what you've done
to deserve it?

442
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:51,955
I do indeed, my boy.

443
00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:54,792
Every morning I look into the mirror
and I say to myself:

444
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:58,079
"Seth Lord, what in the world
have you done to deserve this?"

445
00:32:58,254 --> 00:33:02,382
- And what have you done?
- I beg your pardon? Oh, not a thing.

446
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:05,631
It's a fine place you have.
Build it yourself?

447
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:08,472
Of course. Brick by brick.

448
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:11,006
Quite an undertaking, you know. L...

449
00:33:11,184 --> 00:33:14,802
And it would appear that each brick
is about to fall upon me.

450
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:17,185
- Tracy, your Uncle Willie is here.
- My what?

451
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:19,396
Aren't you gonna greet Uncle Willie?

452
00:33:20,985 --> 00:33:22,812
Uncle Willie!

453
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:26,614
Uncle Willie!

454
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,485
- Father, what are you doing here?
- I have a right to be here.

455
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:33,579
- You're Uncle Willie, understand?
- No. I don't.

456
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:36,286
- I'll explain later.
- Look, everybody...

457
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:39,787
...isn't it nice of Uncle Willie
to surprise us?

458
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:44,209
Miss Imbrie, Mr. Connor,
this is my Uncle Willie.

459
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:51,175
Were you, by any chance,
playing footsie with me at lunch?

460
00:33:51,724 --> 00:33:53,633
From where I sat?

461
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:56,093
I didn't think your reach was that good.

462
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:00,054
Seth Lord has a roving eye. And foot.

463
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:06,729
- Elegant junk.
- It's shiny.

464
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:11,367
Would I trade places with Miss Tracy Lord
for all her wealth and beauty?

465
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:16,162
- Just ask me.
- All right, I will.

466
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:19,950
Would you trade places with Miss Tracy
Lord for all of her wealth and beauty?

467
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:22,963
You know, I can't help thinking about it.

468
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:48,358
Cold?

469
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:53,780
And what little mission of mischief
brings you out of the bushes?

470
00:36:53,948 --> 00:36:55,941
A wedding present.

471
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:58,524
Wouldn't it have been simpler
to have it sent over?

472
00:36:58,703 --> 00:37:00,114
Oh, no.

473
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:04,039
Whoever brought it could never say
what I want to say.

474
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,502
Well?

475
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:11,459
Lovely and unrelenting.

476
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,139
- You said you had something to say.
- I'd hoped you'd changed a little, Tracy...

477
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:19,883
...maybe softened some.

478
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:23,391
Well, not for my sake entirely,
but for yours.

479
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:27,724
- You'd stand a better chance at happiness.
- Thank you. I'll manage.

480
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:30,734
Oh, yeah. I bet you will.
You'll manage all right.

481
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:32,610
You'll manage George too.

482
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:37,072
But heaven help him if he shows
any signs of weakness or rebellion.

483
00:37:37,241 --> 00:37:40,741
I see you haven't changed either, Dexter.

484
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:43,745
I tried hard to figure it out.

485
00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:46,916
Your father hurt you deeply
when he hurt your mother.

486
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:50,204
- Please.
- So you started demanding perfection.

487
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:55,300
Nobody was gonna hurt you.
You felt I tricked you.

488
00:37:56,469 --> 00:38:00,253
I didn't know you wanted a husband
who'd be high priest to a virgin goddess.

489
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:03,800
- Stop using those foul words.
- It's a real pity too, Tracy.

490
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:08,722
You'd be a wonderful woman
if you'd just let your tiara slip a little.

491
00:38:08,898 --> 00:38:12,433
But you'll never be a wonderful woman,
or even a wonderful human being...

492
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,228
...until you learn to have
some regard for human frailty.

493
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:20,776
There's a lot more of you goddesses
around than people realize.

494
00:38:21,077 --> 00:38:24,909
- Is that all you have to say?
- No.

495
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:29,410
Those first weeks we spent together
were the most wonderful I've ever known.

496
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:35,430
Good luck, Sam, and good sailing.

497
00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:47,679
Hey skipper, when do we eat?

498
00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:51,433
Now.

499
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:55,932
- Well, you've been at it long enough.
- It's the bride's prerogative.

500
00:39:56,106 --> 00:39:58,776
I don't like you out of my sight so long.

501
00:39:58,942 --> 00:40:01,149
That's nice.

502
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:03,854
I'll have that fixed in the morning.

503
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,525
First course.

504
00:40:06,158 --> 00:40:08,281
You'll never be able to follow it.

505
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:11,075
Second course.

506
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:14,366
- What is it?
- Tomato juice.

507
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:16,748
It's brilliant.
What did you do?

508
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:20,751
- Opened the can and poured it out.
- It's so piquant.

509
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:23,168
Good.

510
00:40:23,342 --> 00:40:27,505
- Invented by the Earl of Sandwich?
- With something special added.

511
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:34,765
- You hussy!
- You said you'd eat anything.

512
00:40:34,937 --> 00:40:36,894
It's for you.

513
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:22,051
Tracy?

514
00:43:23,313 --> 00:43:25,105
Tracy?

515
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:28,568
Hey.

516
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:30,903
You all right?

517
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:36,693
- Yes. L... I was just...
- I know. Half asleep.

518
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:40,072
Say, aren't you a pretty big girl
to be playing with boats?

519
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:44,576
It's a model of the <i>True Love.</i>
A wedding present from Dexter.

520
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:49,873
We spent our honeymoon on her.
Oh my, she was yare.

521
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:52,586
Yare? What's yare?

522
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:57,303
Sleek, quick to the helm,
everything a boat should be.

523
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:01,508
It seems hardly in good taste
as a wedding present.

524
00:44:01,685 --> 00:44:06,513
George, the true love
never really existed with Dexter.

525
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,813
I want you to know that.

526
00:44:11,403 --> 00:44:13,111
I do know.

527
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,853
That's the wonderful thing about you.

528
00:44:16,492 --> 00:44:19,243
You're untouched by this
foolish first marriage.

529
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,787
There's a beautiful purity about you...

530
00:44:22,956 --> 00:44:26,325
...like a statue to be worshipped.

531
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:29,917
But I don't want to be worshipped.
I want to be loved.

532
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:34,667
That goes without saying. But I also want
you up on a pedestal where you belong.

533
00:44:34,843 --> 00:44:37,085
Where I can look up and adore you.

534
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:45,098
Never mind.

535
00:44:48,857 --> 00:44:51,479
Tracy, aren't you going in, dear?

536
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:55,863
- I've changed my mind.
- Mr. Lord...

537
00:44:57,533 --> 00:45:00,902
...I haven't had a chance to thank you yet
for coming back for the wedding.

538
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:03,533
It was very decent of you
and we both appreciate it.

539
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:06,872
Well, thank you, George.
I felt my wife would not object.

540
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:11,170
George, we moved your things
to make room for those magazine people.

541
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:14,541
- You don't mind, do you?
- Anything you do is all right with me.

542
00:45:14,716 --> 00:45:17,670
We're having cocktails here
before going to Uncle Willie's.

543
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:19,754
I'd better dash off and change.

544
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,804
I'll see you later, Tracy.

545
00:45:21,974 --> 00:45:23,516
Excuse me.

546
00:45:27,563 --> 00:45:30,517
I have a feeling George
is going to take that ring tomorrow...

547
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:33,016
...and go right through center with it.

548
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:35,861
That's very amusing.

549
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:39,612
Almost as amusing as the sight of you
with your arm around Mother.

550
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:43,735
Well, I find it most unamusing
to be passed off as your Uncle Willie.

551
00:45:43,912 --> 00:45:47,577
And do take that tone out of your voice.
It is most unattractive.

552
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:49,789
Oh, really?

553
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,456
And your dancer friend, how does she
speak to you, dulcet and intoxicating?

554
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:57,917
Heady enough to make you
forget family responsibilities?

555
00:45:58,093 --> 00:46:01,794
- Stop it instantly!
- Mother, I can't help it. It's sickening.

556
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:06,184
A magnificent right he's got to come back
in his best head-of-the-family manner...

557
00:46:06,351 --> 00:46:09,471
...and start taking charge
as if he'd done nothing at all.

558
00:46:09,646 --> 00:46:11,639
Well, it's not really your affair.

559
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:13,607
If it concerns anyone...

560
00:46:13,776 --> 00:46:16,445
Actually, I don't know who it
concerns except your father.

561
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:20,941
That is very wise of you, Margaret.
What most wives don't seem to realize...

562
00:46:21,116 --> 00:46:24,781
...is that a husband's philandering,
even as innocuous as my own...

563
00:46:24,953 --> 00:46:27,195
...has nothing whatever to do with them.

564
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:31,659
And pray, just what has it
to do with, then?

565
00:46:31,835 --> 00:46:34,326
A reluctance to grow old, I think.

566
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:38,087
I suppose the best mainstay a man can
have as he gets along in years...

567
00:46:38,258 --> 00:46:39,290
...is a daughter.

568
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,294
The right kind of daughter,
one who's full of warmth and affection...

569
00:46:43,472 --> 00:46:47,256
...a kind of foolish, unquestioning,
uncritical affection.

570
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:51,218
None of which I've got, of course.
I'm a cold goddess.

571
00:46:51,396 --> 00:46:54,848
If your vanity thinks
in terms of goddesses.

572
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:56,899
You have a good mind, Tracy.

573
00:46:57,069 --> 00:47:00,901
You have a pretty face, a fine,
disciplined body that does what you tell it.

574
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:05,865
You have everything it takes to make
a lovely woman, except the one essential:

575
00:47:06,036 --> 00:47:08,159
An understanding heart.

576
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:12,162
Without it, you might just as well
be made of bronze.

577
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,626
That's an awful thing to say to anyone.

578
00:47:17,798 --> 00:47:20,834
- It's an awful thing to have to say.
- Seth, that's too much.

579
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:23,500
I'm afraid it isn't enough.

580
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,348
Darling, your father doesn't mean that.

581
00:47:26,515 --> 00:47:29,006
Neither one of you means it.

582
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:33,345
Both of you seem to forget
that in striking out at each other...

583
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:36,060
...you hurt others besides yourself.

584
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,831
What's the matter with everyone
all of a sudden?

585
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,025
Get in.

586
00:48:38,086 --> 00:48:40,957
Are you learning anything
about the idle rich?

587
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:43,290
Yeah, they drive too fast.

588
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:45,919
Where we headed anyway?

589
00:48:46,094 --> 00:48:49,594
- The graveyard.
- I'm not ready.

590
00:48:49,765 --> 00:48:54,510
I thought I'd show you the playground
of the rich, the graveyard of wealth.

591
00:48:54,686 --> 00:48:56,596
Well, for that I'm ready.

592
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:05,154
Beautiful, isn't it?

593
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:07,562
The grass needs cutting.

594
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:10,322
It's been boarded up for 15 years.

595
00:49:10,494 --> 00:49:13,697
- Why?
- The high cost of being rich.

596
00:49:13,872 --> 00:49:17,407
Most of the homes here are closed up
or sold for taxes.

597
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:19,956
Why don't you write about that?

598
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,791
You've got a chip on your shoulder
about me. Why?

599
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,639
Because you came here
with your mind already made up.

600
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:33,676
The time to make up your mind
about people is never.

601
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:36,555
- I had an opinion.
- Unfavorable and unfair.

602
00:49:36,728 --> 00:49:40,940
Really? What exactly do you do
around here that's so worthwhile?

603
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:43,895
Do you consider what you do worthwhile?

604
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:47,438
Making a living off people's
personal lives and misfortunes?

605
00:49:47,614 --> 00:49:50,948
- I cannot pick and choose.
- You could be anything you wanted to be.

606
00:49:51,118 --> 00:49:54,534
But you'll never be a first-class writer
or human being...

607
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:59,331
...until you learn to have some
compassion or regard for human...

608
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:01,992
- You were saying?
- Nothing.

609
00:50:02,254 --> 00:50:05,255
This is the second time you've
taken me for a ride. I don't like it.

610
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:08,674
- Really?
- Really, Miss Tracy Samantha.

611
00:50:08,844 --> 00:50:13,055
Samantha. What a lovely, musical name.

612
00:50:13,265 --> 00:50:16,100
Reminds me of an Indian cure
for snakebite.

613
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:22,141
- What's it stand for? The name, I mean.
- It stands for no nonsense.

614
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:24,647
What do you do beside collect husbands?

615
00:50:24,818 --> 00:50:29,065
- I mind my own business.
- This happens to be my business.

616
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:33,569
For instance, how old are you,
Miss Lord? 26?

617
00:50:33,744 --> 00:50:35,404
No children?

618
00:50:35,746 --> 00:50:39,660
Time is flying.
What do you do in your spare time?

619
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:43,534
I sometimes endure arrogant reporters.

620
00:50:43,712 --> 00:50:45,705
Arrogant, indeed.

621
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:48,170
Shall we keep this
on an impersonal basis?

622
00:50:48,342 --> 00:50:52,470
- Shall we continue with the full tour?
- Gladly, Miss Lord.

623
00:50:52,638 --> 00:50:54,880
But without the full treatment.

624
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,738
- Another show place, Mr. Connor.
- Yeah, that's quite a shack.

625
00:51:10,906 --> 00:51:13,362
- Who owns that?
- My Uncle Willie.

626
00:51:13,534 --> 00:51:16,321
It's being turned into a boys' school
next year.

627
00:51:16,495 --> 00:51:20,540
He wanted to sell it for taxes. When he
couldn't, he decided to give it away.

628
00:51:20,707 --> 00:51:23,245
It was cheaper. Would you like to see it?

629
00:51:23,418 --> 00:51:24,663
Sure.

630
00:51:26,004 --> 00:51:28,709
- Good afternoon, Lawrence.
- I didn't hear you ring.

631
00:51:28,882 --> 00:51:31,041
We barged in. Is Uncle Willie around?

632
00:51:31,218 --> 00:51:34,468
- No, he hasn't returned from lunch yet.
- That's right. I forgot.

633
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:37,924
- We'll be at the bar, if you don't mind.
- Not at all, Miss Tracy.

634
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,638
- Good afternoon, John.
- Good afternoon, Miss Tracy.

635
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:44,678
- Your Uncle Willie's getting kicked out?
- They're getting ready for a party.

636
00:51:44,857 --> 00:51:47,478
- A last fling?
- Sort of. It's my bachelor party.

637
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,608
- Hello, Tommy.
- Good afternoon.

638
00:51:49,778 --> 00:51:52,448
- Girls only?
- We're democratic. We're allowing men.

639
00:51:52,614 --> 00:51:56,149
The only bachelor parties I attended
were with girls who came out of cakes.

640
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:58,485
Please, Mr. Connor. This is Newport.

641
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,291
This is a bar?

642
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,789
Uncle Willie's the kind of man who
doesn't like to go far when he's thirsty.

643
00:52:08,964 --> 00:52:11,633
I'm gonna have to buddy it up
with Uncle Willie.

644
00:52:19,308 --> 00:52:21,680
I had a bed that did that once.

645
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:26,145
Are you getting an interesting story on us,
Mr. Connor?

646
00:52:27,983 --> 00:52:30,141
Why can't you break down
and call me Mike?

647
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:35,657
I couldn't possibly break down.
I was raised on a pedestal. Would you?

648
00:52:36,074 --> 00:52:40,119
I sense something's bothering you
and I'm getting clobbered for it.

649
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:42,030
You're a darned attractive girl.

650
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:44,993
But instead of an orchid on your shoulder,
you're wearing a chip.

651
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:48,500
You think I'm attractive? A high priestess?

652
00:52:49,087 --> 00:52:50,961
You're awful tough to figure.

653
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:54,796
When you write your story about us,
compare me to one of these homes...

654
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:59,844
...boarded up, a thing of the past,
a relic to be sold for taxes.

655
00:53:00,015 --> 00:53:02,886
Miss Lord, you've got rocks in your head.

656
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,354
No. The truth is that I don't
fit into the landscape either.

657
00:53:07,523 --> 00:53:11,271
- The house has been boarded up too long.
- There's an answer for that too.

658
00:53:11,443 --> 00:53:14,113
Tear the boards down.
Throw open the windows...

659
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:16,521
...and let the wind blow through.

660
00:53:16,698 --> 00:53:18,691
That's better.

661
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:30,390
What goes on here?

662
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,719
There's a dark horse in this race
and my boy's running a slow third.

663
00:56:35,898 --> 00:56:40,192
What we need is a little
change-of-pace music, Junior.

664
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:51,837
Now we're getting warm.

665
01:00:01,103 --> 01:00:02,930
That's quite a brawl.

666
01:00:03,105 --> 01:00:06,106
Yes. One of the prettiest sights
in this pretty world...

667
01:00:06,275 --> 01:00:10,486
...is the sight of the privileged class
enjoying its privileges.

668
01:00:11,071 --> 01:00:14,191
They're really not a bad bunch
when you get to know them.

669
01:00:14,366 --> 01:00:19,111
- You getting to know them?
- Slowly.

670
01:00:19,288 --> 01:00:24,115
"With the rich and mighty, it takes a little
patience." That's an old Spanish proverb.

671
01:00:24,293 --> 01:00:26,962
Yes. Well, I come
from a long line of Swedes.

672
01:00:27,129 --> 01:00:28,920
We have an old saying too:

673
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:32,126
"When the cat's away,
why should the mouse act like a rat?"

674
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:35,005
Liz! Liz, I've been looking for you.

675
01:00:35,179 --> 01:00:38,963
Really? Well, I've been right here
all the time, Mr. Lord.

676
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:44,384
- I beg your pardon? Oh, no, call me Seth.
- Seth.

677
01:00:44,563 --> 01:00:48,643
Your daughter doesn't resemble you.
In fact, there's an amazing difference.

678
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:54,156
Well, naturally. She's a girl, you know,
and I'm a wicked old man.

679
01:00:55,657 --> 01:00:57,697
Willie!

680
01:00:57,868 --> 01:00:59,777
Dexter's looking for you.

681
01:00:59,953 --> 01:01:01,863
Mrs. Lord, you called him Willie.

682
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:05,574
Miss Imbrie, there's a misunderstanding
which I'd like to clear up.

683
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:09,001
- In the first place, I'm Seth Lord.
- Yes. Yes.

684
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:12,255
- Well, that makes you...
- Available.

685
01:01:12,424 --> 01:01:14,168
- I don't get it.
- Don't go away.

686
01:01:14,343 --> 01:01:15,967
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, dear.

687
01:01:16,136 --> 01:01:19,173
You are here in exchange
for repressing an article about me.

688
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:22,017
However, you should know
that I'll sue your editor...

689
01:01:22,184 --> 01:01:25,968
...if anything derogatory
to any of us is published. Okay?

690
01:01:26,146 --> 01:01:31,141
- I hope you do.
- Mr. Lord, Mrs. Lord, you must know...

691
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:33,891
...that Mike and I weren't told
anything about this.

692
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:36,692
- Why, of course.
- Mother!

693
01:01:37,908 --> 01:01:40,197
Mother, I'm so glad to see you.

694
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:42,445
- Mike.
- Hello, Mr. Kittredge.

695
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:44,448
Hello, Father.

696
01:01:44,623 --> 01:01:47,541
- Miss Imbrie, you having a wonderful time?
- Wonderful.

697
01:01:47,709 --> 01:01:51,659
- Mike, are you having a wonderful time?
- It's a gasser.

698
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:55,373
Isn't that wonderful? George?

699
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:59,343
- Shall we dance?
- We were.

700
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,050
Goodbye.

701
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:07,136
George?

702
01:02:07,312 --> 01:02:09,768
Are you having a wonderful time?

703
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:13,391
- Isn't it a beautiful party?
- Yes, a very nice party.

704
01:02:13,569 --> 01:02:16,018
Wouldn't you like to sit down, dear?

705
01:02:16,118 --> 01:02:19,197
Here? Don't be silly. We'll get stepped on.

706
01:02:19,366 --> 01:02:23,945
I thought perhaps you were tired.
I see that Dexter's here.

707
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:27,572
Everybody's here.
Everybody's having a wonderful time.

708
01:02:27,749 --> 01:02:29,457
That's nice, isn't it, George?

709
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:31,952
Yes, it's very nice, Tracy, very nice.

710
01:02:32,129 --> 01:02:33,920
Very nice.

711
01:02:39,553 --> 01:02:43,254
Thank you very much.
That was splendid. Very nice indeed.

712
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:48,509
We are honored in Newport to have
visiting us several famous orchestras...

713
01:02:48,687 --> 01:02:52,637
...for the jazz festival tomorrow night.

714
01:02:52,816 --> 01:02:55,770
Among them,
the greatest of them all...

715
01:02:55,944 --> 01:03:01,365
...Mr. Louis Armstrong. Yeah.

716
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:06,279
We also have with us one of the sponsors
of the festival, Mr. Dexter-Haven.

717
01:03:06,455 --> 01:03:10,951
- So I'll ask Dexter to explain.
- Thank you.

718
01:03:13,212 --> 01:03:18,798
Dear gentle folk of Newport...
Or maybe I should say, "hats and cats"?

719
01:03:18,967 --> 01:03:21,174
I want you to lend an ear because...

720
01:03:21,345 --> 01:03:26,552
Well, I want you to hear
some really shimmering sharps and flats.

721
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:34,554
- Look here, I want to dance with Tracy.
- Do you, Uncle Willie? That's nice.

722
01:07:34,723 --> 01:07:36,846
You two can dance the rest of your life.

723
01:07:37,017 --> 01:07:40,137
- Let's the three of us dance together.
- No, no, no, my dear.

724
01:07:40,312 --> 01:07:43,479
That just isn't done, you know.

725
01:07:43,982 --> 01:07:48,063
- Are you having a wonderful time?
- I most certainly am.

726
01:07:48,237 --> 01:07:50,562
You know,
you're my very favorite uncle.

727
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:53,740
I'd be highly complimented
if it weren't for the fact...

728
01:07:53,909 --> 01:07:56,317
...that I'm the only uncle you have.

729
01:07:56,495 --> 01:08:02,829
I think that's sad. You're the only uncle
I have in the whole world.

730
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,760
- May I?
- May you what?

731
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:23,304
- Dance with the bride.
- You may dance with the bride.

732
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:28,640
- Are you coming to my wedding, Dexter?
- No.

733
01:08:28,819 --> 01:08:32,769
- What's the matter, don't like weddings?
- Depends on who's getting married.

734
01:08:32,948 --> 01:08:35,949
- It's gonna be a nice wedding.
- I'm sure it will.

735
01:08:36,118 --> 01:08:40,412
That's a very cute song you sang.
Why don't you write cute songs like that?

736
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:45,124
- I wrote that one.
- Well, I still like it.

737
01:08:45,294 --> 01:08:49,042
- You're really floating tonight, aren't you?
- Really floating, aren't I?

738
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:52,630
I'm sensational, everybody said so.

739
01:08:54,136 --> 01:08:56,259
It got dark all of a sudden.

740
01:08:57,306 --> 01:09:00,141
- Very dark.
- It's too dark.

741
01:09:01,935 --> 01:09:05,221
Since I won't be at the wedding,
don't I get to kiss the bride?

742
01:09:05,397 --> 01:09:09,976
Everybody kisses the bride. I want
everybody to be happy, even you, Dexter.

743
01:09:10,152 --> 01:09:12,560
You may kiss the bride.

744
01:09:12,821 --> 01:09:16,771
Oh, Sam, all the happiness in the world.

745
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:19,409
Oh, Dex.

746
01:09:21,497 --> 01:09:23,157
Tracy!

747
01:09:26,168 --> 01:09:28,955
- Hello, George.
- Just kissing the bride.

748
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:30,707
You know, the old custom.

749
01:09:30,881 --> 01:09:33,633
Yes, just kissing the bride.
It's a very old custom.

750
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:37,668
You're not fooling anybody, Dexter.
The wedding is tomorrow...

751
01:09:37,846 --> 01:09:41,678
...and you're not gonna block it.
Come on, dear.

752
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,973
- Are we gonna dance, George?
- No, dear.

753
01:09:44,144 --> 01:09:47,015
- What are we going to do?
- I think you ought to lie down.

754
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:50,309
But I feel fine. I'm sensational.

755
01:10:13,423 --> 01:10:15,215
Behave yourself.

756
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:32,644
You're sensational, all right.

757
01:10:35,946 --> 01:10:40,026
Now, I want you to lie down and rest.
I'll see that you're not disturbed.

758
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:44,779
- George, lie down with me.
- Tracy!

759
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:52,927
You'll find it under Harvard Classics.

760
01:11:53,107 --> 01:11:56,855
Give Darwin a little nudge there.

761
01:12:03,951 --> 01:12:08,696
I thought I'd pour a little champagne.
It's a great leveler.

762
01:12:08,872 --> 01:12:11,328
- It makes you my equal.
- I wouldn't say that.

763
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,335
Well, it almost makes you my equal.

764
01:12:15,003 --> 01:12:17,245
C.K. Dexter-Haven...

765
01:12:17,422 --> 01:12:20,459
...didn't you once know
a girl named Tracy Samantha Lord?

766
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:24,501
- Sounds familiar.
- No, you didn't.

767
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,385
If you had known her,
you'd never let her get away.

768
01:12:27,558 --> 01:12:29,515
- You got hiccups.
- Excuse.

769
01:12:29,685 --> 01:12:31,559
It's all right.

770
01:12:32,688 --> 01:12:35,060
Tracy's no ordinary woman.

771
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:37,355
So I understand.

772
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,685
You are still in love with her.

773
01:12:40,863 --> 01:12:45,359
- Don't deny it, buddy.
- I wasn't going to.

774
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,407
- Does she know this?
- Yeah, she knows it.

775
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:54,163
- No, that ain't the way I get it.
- What's that?

776
01:14:14,498 --> 01:14:15,826
I'm gonna have a drink.

777
01:14:15,999 --> 01:14:17,957
I may have some bubbly myself.

778
01:14:18,127 --> 01:14:20,962
- I'm gonna dance.
- Don't get hurt.

779
01:16:53,449 --> 01:16:54,824
Hands up!

780
01:16:55,284 --> 01:16:57,276
I hate you.

781
01:16:57,453 --> 01:17:00,786
- Where do you think you're going?
- Someplace and dance.

782
01:17:00,956 --> 01:17:02,415
But they're dancing in there.

783
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:08,123
I know, but George is frowning at me.
I can't dance when anyone frowns at me.

784
01:17:09,339 --> 01:17:11,747
We'll go over the wall.

785
01:17:14,052 --> 01:17:17,386
- Whose car shall we use?
- Anyone's.

786
01:17:17,556 --> 01:17:21,091
- Let's use the blue one.
- No, that's mine.

787
01:17:22,853 --> 01:17:28,013
- Hello, George. Where's Tracy?
- Powdering her nose.

788
01:17:38,076 --> 01:17:42,655
- Hello.
- Hello. You look fine.

789
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:48,667
I feel fine.
Do you hear a telephone ringing?

790
01:17:48,837 --> 01:17:53,665
It's my bedroom telephone.
It's probably George.

791
01:17:53,842 --> 01:17:58,303
- You can't marry him.
- No? Well, I'm going to.

792
01:17:58,472 --> 01:18:02,683
- He's not in your class.
- Snob.

793
01:18:02,851 --> 01:18:06,719
George comes from the so-called
"lower class," Dexter from the upper.

794
01:18:06,897 --> 01:18:10,017
Well, I'll take the lower every time.

795
01:18:10,192 --> 01:18:13,395
Sure, as long as you can't get
a drawing room.

796
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,112
- You're insulting.
- I'm sorry.

797
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,238
- Don't apologize.
- Who's apologizing?

798
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:18,439
You are.

799
01:18:18,617 --> 01:18:22,864
If you don't think I'll marry George,
you come around tomorrow morning.

800
01:18:23,038 --> 01:18:26,372
It's already tomorrow morning.

801
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:29,626
So it is.
Oh, let's not quarrel, Mike.

802
01:18:29,795 --> 01:18:35,418
- What you need is another drink.
- That's right.

803
01:18:42,766 --> 01:18:44,177
I can't find Liz.

804
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:47,352
I just saw someone wander out
into the garden. Alone.

805
01:18:47,521 --> 01:18:50,972
Oh, you don't tell me.
The little vixen.

806
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:53,189
Ollie ollie oxen free.

807
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:58,651
- Uncle Willie giving you a little trouble?
- He's gonna end up a juvenile delinquent.

808
01:18:58,824 --> 01:19:01,611
- Have you seen Mike anywhere?
- No.

809
01:19:01,785 --> 01:19:04,407
No? That's funny.
He disappeared over an hour ago.

810
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,611
Where's Tracy?

811
01:19:05,789 --> 01:19:08,411
This party's turning into
a game of hide-and-seek.

812
01:19:08,584 --> 01:19:10,410
- She's disappeared.
- Phone her at home.

813
01:19:10,586 --> 01:19:13,587
- I did. There was no answer.
- Try again.

814
01:19:13,755 --> 01:19:15,795
All right, I will.

815
01:19:17,092 --> 01:19:20,876
Well, since Mike's disappeared too,
I may as well go home.

816
01:19:21,054 --> 01:19:24,922
How about me taking you home?
Then everybody'd come look for us.

817
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,185
That's the nicest thing I've heard tonight.

818
01:19:39,782 --> 01:19:44,942
You know, the strangest thing.
I keep thinking I hear bells.

819
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,611
That's the champagne for you.

820
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:50,790
They're now putting bells in the bubbles.

821
01:19:52,127 --> 01:19:54,832
You're quite a fellow.

822
01:19:55,005 --> 01:19:57,294
That's what they say.

823
01:19:57,716 --> 01:20:02,212
- Let's go for a swim in the moonlight.
- But you wanted to dance.

824
01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:06,681
- Tonight I want to do everything.
- Rumba.

825
01:22:21,026 --> 01:22:25,071
Oh, Tracy, Tracy.
Darling, you're lit from within.

826
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:27,112
Bright, so bright.

827
01:22:27,282 --> 01:22:32,739
- I don't seem made of bronze, then?
- No, you're made of flesh and blood.

828
01:22:32,913 --> 01:22:36,911
- That's the blank, unholy surprise of it all.
- Oh, Mike, keep talking.

829
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:40,251
- All of a sudden I've got the shakes.
- Yeah, me too.

830
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:44,370
- What is it?
- It couldn't be love, could it?

831
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:46,791
Oh, no, no, no, it mustn't.

832
01:22:46,969 --> 01:22:51,298
- Why? Would it be inconvenient?
- Terribly.

833
01:22:51,473 --> 01:22:56,100
Oh, Tracy. You're tremendous!

834
01:22:56,854 --> 01:23:00,305
That's funny, because I feel very small.

835
01:23:00,482 --> 01:23:03,602
Put me in your pocket, Mike.

836
01:23:13,745 --> 01:23:19,535
Golly. Golly Moses.
We're out of our minds.

837
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:21,501
And into our hearts, though.

838
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:24,126
What are we going to do?

839
01:23:24,298 --> 01:23:28,545
I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna go into the water.

840
01:23:35,517 --> 01:23:38,471
Liz, you're in love
with Connor, aren't you?

841
01:23:38,645 --> 01:23:40,555
People ask the darndest questions.

842
01:23:40,731 --> 01:23:43,056
Why don't you marry him?

843
01:23:43,233 --> 01:23:46,020
I didn't hear you.

844
01:23:46,195 --> 01:23:49,860
I'm going to bed.
Thank you, Mr. C.K. Dexter-Haven.

845
01:23:50,032 --> 01:23:53,697
I said, why don't you marry him?

846
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:58,700
I think he's still got a lot to learn.
I don't wanna get in his way for a while.

847
01:23:58,874 --> 01:24:01,745
Suppose some other dame
comes along in the meantime?

848
01:24:01,919 --> 01:24:09,167
I'd scratch her eyes out. Unless she
were marrying someone else the next day.

849
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:10,718
You're quite a gal, Liz.

850
01:24:10,886 --> 01:24:13,555
Oh, I don't know.
I take nice pictures, though.

851
01:24:13,722 --> 01:24:15,762
- Night.
- Night.

852
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:22,094
- Oh, it's you, Mr. Haven.
- Hey, Mac.

853
01:24:22,272 --> 01:24:24,977
There's so much loot for the wedding,
I keep checking.

854
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:28,851
I won't take anything. I'm not
getting married this time, you know.

855
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:32,730
- I wish it were, sir. Good night.
- Good night.

856
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:43,497
- That you, Haven?
- Oh, yeah.

857
01:24:43,669 --> 01:24:47,916
- What are you doing here?
- I just brought Liz home. Why?

858
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:50,082
I still haven't found Tracy.

859
01:24:50,259 --> 01:24:55,086
Well, she's asleep, I should say.
She's getting married tomorrow.

860
01:24:55,514 --> 01:24:59,346
Don't be funny. I telephoned her.
Her phone didn't answer.

861
01:24:59,518 --> 01:25:04,310
When we were married, that phone would
always ring and she'd never bat an eye.

862
01:25:04,481 --> 01:25:06,557
She's a very remarkable girl.
I recall...

863
01:25:06,733 --> 01:25:11,277
I prefer not to discuss Tracy
with you, if you don't mind.

864
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:16,693
You've got a very big day tomorrow.
Let me walk you to the gatehouse.

865
01:25:16,869 --> 01:25:20,119
- That sounds like Tracy.
- No, that's the night watchman.

866
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:24,832
- It's a woman's voice.
- Well, he's a lyric tenor, you see.

867
01:25:28,547 --> 01:25:29,958
That's right.

868
01:25:30,507 --> 01:25:34,291
- George, honestly, I think you should go.
- Beautiful.

869
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:38,004
Okay, but you're never gonna understand.

870
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:43,057
That's nice. That's nice.

871
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:51,733
You can sing for me anytime, Tracy.

872
01:25:51,904 --> 01:25:54,477
- Take me upstairs, Mike.
- Tracy!

873
01:25:54,656 --> 01:25:58,737
Oh, hello, Georgie Porgie.

874
01:25:59,495 --> 01:26:01,986
She sprained her ankle?

875
01:26:03,665 --> 01:26:06,501
Not wounded, sire, but dead.

876
01:26:06,668 --> 01:26:12,504
She dove in the pool. And when she
hit the water, the wine hit her.

877
01:26:12,674 --> 01:26:15,794
- You expect me to believe that, Connor?
- I don't give a...

878
01:26:15,969 --> 01:26:19,219
It's right up at the top of the stairs.
Second door to the right.

879
01:26:19,389 --> 01:26:22,225
- Fairies are at the bottom of my garden.
- I know.

880
01:26:22,392 --> 01:26:25,477
- They're all ringing little bells.
- Congratulations.

881
01:26:29,733 --> 01:26:34,810
I wouldn't go jumping at conclusions.
This isn't all that meets the eye here.

882
01:26:34,988 --> 01:26:37,859
Tracy, of all people.

883
01:26:38,033 --> 01:26:39,942
Yes, Tracy, of all people.

884
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:41,945
But you don't believe...

885
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:44,694
The implications aren't exactly
what they seem.

886
01:26:44,873 --> 01:26:48,741
- I suppose you think it's innocent.
- I'm sure the intention was innocent.

887
01:26:48,919 --> 01:26:51,291
You don't know women
as well as I thought you did.

888
01:26:51,463 --> 01:26:53,171
How could she do this to me?

889
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:57,420
In the morning, Tracy won't
remember a thing that happened tonight.

890
01:26:57,594 --> 01:27:03,383
- I think you ought to forget about it too.
- Oh, you and your sophisticated ideas!

891
01:27:03,559 --> 01:27:06,429
It all comes from having things
too easy all your life.

892
01:27:06,645 --> 01:27:09,017
Oh, yes, it's terrible, isn't it?

893
01:27:10,607 --> 01:27:15,186
- If you fellas will listen to me...
- You filthy...

894
01:27:15,737 --> 01:27:21,776
I'm sorry, but she isn't your wife yet,
and she was mine, you know.

895
01:27:24,246 --> 01:27:25,740
You okay, Connor?

896
01:27:25,914 --> 01:27:29,579
I thought I'd better hit you before he did.
He's in much better shape.

897
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:30,866
You'll do.

898
01:27:31,044 --> 01:27:35,422
Say, pal, just what did
happen here tonight?

899
01:27:35,591 --> 01:27:37,749
Well, see, I...

900
01:27:48,854 --> 01:27:52,554
Well, I guess we're really gonna
have a wedding after all.

901
01:27:52,733 --> 01:27:56,398
For a while last night,
it seemed to be touch-and-go.

902
01:27:58,071 --> 01:28:02,864
Shouldn't you be out front taking pictures
of the guests as they arrive?

903
01:28:03,035 --> 01:28:04,612
Am I in your way?

904
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,864
I haven't noticed.

905
01:28:08,248 --> 01:28:12,709
Look, Mike. If I ever am in your way,
don't honk.

906
01:28:12,878 --> 01:28:14,538
Just run over me.

907
01:28:15,214 --> 01:28:17,586
You're quite a girl, Liz.

908
01:28:18,592 --> 01:28:22,969
That's the second time in the last
24 hours that a man has said that to me.

909
01:28:23,138 --> 01:28:27,800
I guess I must be getting either booky,
hippy or toothy.

910
01:28:28,393 --> 01:28:30,719
I'll get my Brownie and go to work.

911
01:28:47,913 --> 01:28:50,486
Shut up, you fool!

912
01:28:55,546 --> 01:28:56,791
Good morning, sir.

913
01:28:56,964 --> 01:29:01,839
Don't scream at the top of your lungs.
I had champagne last night.

914
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,125
Sorry, sir.

915
01:29:04,012 --> 01:29:08,840
- Could I get you anything, sir?
- You might give me a glass of that water.

916
01:29:09,017 --> 01:29:11,508
And a new head, if you've got one.

917
01:29:11,687 --> 01:29:13,229
What's going on here anyway?

918
01:29:13,397 --> 01:29:16,932
I expected to find the police
and at least two hacked-up bodies.

919
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:18,437
The police, sir?

920
01:29:19,653 --> 01:29:21,480
Has anything happened to Caroline?

921
01:29:21,864 --> 01:29:23,572
Good morning, Willie.

922
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:25,650
- Good morning.
- Don't get up, dear.

923
01:29:25,826 --> 01:29:26,941
Thank you. Thank you.

924
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:29,111
What is the matter with Caroline?

925
01:29:29,288 --> 01:29:33,748
She's been telephoning all morning,
urging me to get here before the wedding.

926
01:29:33,917 --> 01:29:37,037
She's been screaming that
it's a matter of life and death.

927
01:29:37,212 --> 01:29:39,335
I don't know what's the matter with her.

928
01:29:39,506 --> 01:29:43,255
She dashed in this morning,
screaming that Tracy can't marry George.

929
01:29:43,427 --> 01:29:45,466
That she must marry that newspaperman.

930
01:29:45,637 --> 01:29:48,472
- You don't say! Why?
- Yes, why?

931
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,677
What's Caroline's reason?
Hi, Willie. Sweetheart.

932
01:29:51,852 --> 01:29:54,521
- Can I have a little jam?
- Yes, dear. I don't know.

933
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:58,187
Caroline must've had a nightmare
about something she thought she saw.

934
01:29:58,358 --> 01:30:01,395
I'll have to keep her in her room
until after the wedding.

935
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:05,899
- It must've been a bad dream.
- It must've been a whizzer.

936
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:08,317
Uncle Willie, may I tell you something?

937
01:30:08,494 --> 01:30:11,032
This morning
you look like a tree full of owls.

938
01:30:11,622 --> 01:30:17,577
This is the sort of day that history
teaches us is better spent in bed.

939
01:30:17,753 --> 01:30:19,413
Hello, everybody!

940
01:30:19,588 --> 01:30:22,838
Isn't it a fine day, though?
Is everybody fine?

941
01:30:23,008 --> 01:30:24,633
That's fine.

942
01:30:27,304 --> 01:30:31,005
Oh, good morning, Uncle Willie.
Where is everybody?

943
01:30:33,435 --> 01:30:38,774
- Do you like my dress?
- Oh, yes, it's quite beautiful, my dear.

944
01:30:38,941 --> 01:30:40,768
It's awfully heavy.

945
01:30:41,443 --> 01:30:44,278
I can't seem to get my eyes open.

946
01:30:44,446 --> 01:30:47,020
Oh, Dexter! What are you doing here?

947
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:48,942
Caroline called me to come over.

948
01:30:49,118 --> 01:30:51,739
She's been telephoning
everybody in the county.

949
01:30:51,912 --> 01:30:56,241
- Now, go home! Please do!
- Oh, no, not until we get those eyes open.

950
01:30:56,416 --> 01:30:58,789
And how do you feel otherwise?

951
01:30:59,711 --> 01:31:03,840
Oh, I don't know
what's the matter with me. L...

952
01:31:04,007 --> 01:31:07,756
I don't seem to remember last night at all.

953
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:11,760
- I must've had too much sun yesterday.
- Yes, the sun will do it every time.

954
01:31:11,932 --> 01:31:14,423
You left the party
and came right home to bed.

955
01:31:14,601 --> 01:31:19,062
I did? Thank you.
It's nice to have things accounted for.

956
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:21,639
Only, I wonder what this might be?

957
01:31:21,817 --> 01:31:24,272
It appears to be
a gentleman's wristwatch.

958
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:26,188
But whose? I nearly stepped on it.

959
01:31:26,363 --> 01:31:28,439
- Getting out of bed?
- Yes, why?

960
01:31:28,615 --> 01:31:30,323
Oh, nothing.

961
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:38,949
There's another mystery.
I think I was robbed last night.

962
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:40,157
Oh, really?

963
01:31:40,335 --> 01:31:44,914
Yes. My engagement ring and earrings
and bracelets are missing everywhere.

964
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:48,174
Somebody's houseguest
from New York, no doubt.

965
01:31:48,343 --> 01:31:53,005
- Nobody's here from New York.
- I have a few little baubles here.

966
01:31:53,182 --> 01:31:57,310
- Where did you find them?
- Don't tell me you don't remember.

967
01:31:57,478 --> 01:32:00,348
- Did I give them to you?
- I just stumbled across them.

968
01:32:00,522 --> 01:32:03,808
Sam, if you're gonna drink champagne,
you ought to take a swim.

969
01:32:03,984 --> 01:32:07,519
Nothing like a swim, you know,
to open the eyes.

970
01:32:11,241 --> 01:32:12,570
Now they're open.

971
01:32:12,743 --> 01:32:16,443
What do you say we slip into the pantry
and have a little toddy for the body?

972
01:32:16,622 --> 01:32:18,365
Medicinal.

973
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:25,419
If it gets dull around here, have Caroline
tell you about her dream. It's a dilly.

974
01:33:00,999 --> 01:33:02,375
Morning.

975
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:08,542
You... You all right?

976
01:33:08,715 --> 01:33:12,049
Me? Of course.
Why shouldn't I be?

977
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:16,169
- You put away a gang of wine last night.
- I had a simply wonderful evening.

978
01:33:16,348 --> 01:33:19,966
- I hope you enjoyed it too.
- Oh, yes, I sure did. Indeed I did.

979
01:33:20,144 --> 01:33:22,432
Especially the last part of it.

980
01:33:23,188 --> 01:33:26,023
Why especially the last?

981
01:33:26,358 --> 01:33:28,481
You're asking me?

982
01:33:28,652 --> 01:33:33,777
Oh, you mean the swim?
We did swim and so forth, didn't we?

983
01:33:33,949 --> 01:33:36,784
Yeah, we swam and so forth.

984
01:33:37,911 --> 01:33:41,956
- What can I say, darling?
- Oh, not anything. Don't say anything.

985
01:33:42,124 --> 01:33:44,163
And especially not darling.

986
01:33:45,043 --> 01:33:47,713
You mean you're going through with it?
The wedding?

987
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,290
Why shouldn't I?

988
01:33:49,465 --> 01:33:51,920
No regrets about last night?

989
01:33:52,092 --> 01:33:54,464
Why should I have?

990
01:33:55,804 --> 01:33:58,591
That's the stuff, Tracy.
You're wonderful!

991
01:33:58,765 --> 01:34:00,723
No, Mike,
you don't know what I mean.

992
01:34:00,893 --> 01:34:04,641
I'm asking you. Tell me the reason
why I shouldn't have.

993
01:34:04,813 --> 01:34:09,356
No, don't. Just tell me what time it is.

994
01:34:09,526 --> 01:34:13,441
I'd love to,
but I seem to have lost my watch.

995
01:34:14,823 --> 01:34:19,569
You don't know how extremely sorry I am
to hear you say that.

996
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:23,449
Oh, there it is.

997
01:34:23,665 --> 01:34:26,583
I ought to give you a reward.
Where'd you find it?

998
01:34:27,586 --> 01:34:31,002
Let's just say I stumbled over it.

999
01:34:32,007 --> 01:34:33,122
Hey, Mike.

1000
01:34:33,926 --> 01:34:37,010
How are you this bright
and festive morning?

1001
01:34:37,179 --> 01:34:40,595
- That for me?
- No, it's for Tracy. Would you like one?

1002
01:34:40,766 --> 01:34:43,435
I'd sell my grandmother for a drink.

1003
01:34:43,602 --> 01:34:45,180
Uncle Willie's in the pantry...

1004
01:34:45,354 --> 01:34:48,687
...doing weird and wonderful things
with various healing waters.

1005
01:34:48,857 --> 01:34:51,527
- Can I ask for two?
- Go till you run out of grandmothers.

1006
01:34:51,693 --> 01:34:53,401
I'll be drinking a long time.

1007
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:55,644
Doctor's orders, Sam.

1008
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:58,610
- What is it?
- Just the juice of a few fresh flowers.

1009
01:34:58,784 --> 01:35:01,820
- It's called a stinger. Removes the sting.
- Don't say that.

1010
01:35:01,995 --> 01:35:03,371
Why not?

1011
01:35:03,539 --> 01:35:07,038
Nothing can. Nothing ever will.

1012
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,202
I've done the most terrible thing to you.

1013
01:35:10,379 --> 01:35:13,380
Oh, I doubt that. I doubt that very much.

1014
01:35:13,966 --> 01:35:18,426
I've always been so hard
on people who weren't perfect.

1015
01:35:19,179 --> 01:35:21,931
- What am I going to do?
- Well, why to me, darling?

1016
01:35:22,099 --> 01:35:24,554
I don't see
where I figure in this anymore.

1017
01:35:24,726 --> 01:35:27,846
Aren't you confusing me
with a fella named George Kittredge?

1018
01:35:28,021 --> 01:35:30,726
George! I've got to tell him!

1019
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:35,941
- He knows. He was here too.
- Good grief, why didn't you sell tickets?

1020
01:35:36,905 --> 01:35:38,649
You better finish your drink.

1021
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:44,370
What did George say last night?

1022
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:49,877
Well, he was a little shaken,
but I guess he'll rally.

1023
01:35:51,128 --> 01:35:54,544
Oh, I'm such an unholy mess of a girl.

1024
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:59,175
Oh, now, come on.
That's not even good conversation.

1025
01:35:59,344 --> 01:36:01,171
How'd you like my wedding present?

1026
01:36:01,346 --> 01:36:04,881
I'm not used to having
my gifts go unacknowledged.

1027
01:36:05,058 --> 01:36:08,558
Oh, it was beautiful and sweet.

1028
01:36:08,812 --> 01:36:14,055
- She was quite a boat, the <i>True Love.</i>
- Was and is.

1029
01:36:14,443 --> 01:36:16,685
Boy, she was yare.

1030
01:36:17,154 --> 01:36:18,814
But I wasn't, was I?

1031
01:36:18,989 --> 01:36:22,488
No, you were.
You were very good at the bright work.

1032
01:36:23,285 --> 01:36:25,610
I can still see you out there on the deck.

1033
01:36:25,788 --> 01:36:29,073
Down on your knees
with your little cake of polish.

1034
01:36:29,249 --> 01:36:31,206
I made her shine.

1035
01:36:32,002 --> 01:36:34,789
- Where is she now?
- She's in the yards being gone over.

1036
01:36:34,963 --> 01:36:38,463
I thought I'd sell her to this fella,
Rufe Watries, at Oyster Bay.

1037
01:36:38,634 --> 01:36:39,962
- For money?
- Why not?

1038
01:36:40,135 --> 01:36:43,800
- To that fat old rum pot?
- I'm gonna design another.

1039
01:36:43,972 --> 01:36:47,472
Thought I'd call it the <i>True Love II.</i>
What do you think?

1040
01:36:47,643 --> 01:36:51,343
I'll tell you what you could call her:
The <i>Easy Virtue.</i>

1041
01:36:51,522 --> 01:36:53,645
Oh, now, come on, Sam.

1042
01:36:53,816 --> 01:36:56,982
I won't have you thinking such things
about yourself. Cut it out.

1043
01:36:57,152 --> 01:36:58,315
But it's true.

1044
01:36:58,487 --> 01:37:01,571
A little slip now and then
is good for people.

1045
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:03,649
Especially if they learn something.

1046
01:37:04,827 --> 01:37:07,448
On, I don't know anything anymore.

1047
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:10,824
Now, that sounds hopeful.
That's just fine.

1048
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:14,038
Well, there's one
consoling thought, Dexter.

1049
01:37:14,211 --> 01:37:19,087
- You're well rid of me.
- No, nobody can say that but me.

1050
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:26,546
I hope we're not interrupting anything.
As if we didn't know we were.

1051
01:37:26,849 --> 01:37:30,467
Tracy, Liz and I think we're gonna
resign from <i>SPY</i> magazine.

1052
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:32,601
We're not turning in the story.

1053
01:37:32,771 --> 01:37:35,262
We're gonna burn it
to keep warm this winter.

1054
01:37:35,441 --> 01:37:40,648
- You can have it as a wedding present.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you both.

1055
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:46,160
You're dear and sweet,
and I don't deserve your kindness.

1056
01:37:46,326 --> 01:37:49,493
- Easy come, easy go.
- Oh, but you'll stay for the wedding?

1057
01:37:49,663 --> 01:37:53,198
Oh, well, l...
Oh, here comes the groom!

1058
01:37:57,546 --> 01:37:59,585
Why, it's George.

1059
01:38:02,926 --> 01:38:06,295
Tracy, please get rid
of these people. I want to talk to you.

1060
01:38:06,472 --> 01:38:08,588
There's no need for them to go.

1061
01:38:08,688 --> 01:38:11,553
Everybody seems to
know about last night.

1062
01:38:11,894 --> 01:38:15,594
- Just collecting expressions.
- It's a lovely day for a wedding.

1063
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:17,300
It rained for us.

1064
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,641
I'm not sure yet that
there'll be a wedding.

1065
01:38:19,818 --> 01:38:24,065
I've been up all night. I cannot decide
what is the best thing to do.

1066
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:34,572
I'm entitled to a full explanation
before I'm asked to make a decision.

1067
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:37,953
Unfortunately, George,
I have no explanation.

1068
01:38:38,128 --> 01:38:41,544
I wish for your sake,
as well as mine, I had.

1069
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:45,416
- You'll grant I have the right to be angry.
- You certainly have.

1070
01:38:45,594 --> 01:38:48,761
- On the very eve of your wedding.
- I told you I agreed.

1071
01:38:48,931 --> 01:38:50,591
Better hurry up and decide.

1072
01:38:50,766 --> 01:38:53,518
- The guests are all settled.
- This doesn't concern you.

1073
01:38:53,685 --> 01:38:56,473
- Nor you.
- No, don't go. Please stay.

1074
01:38:56,647 --> 01:38:59,102
- On the eve of your wedding.
- You've said that.

1075
01:38:59,274 --> 01:39:01,148
You keep out of this. And you too.

1076
01:39:01,318 --> 01:39:06,110
Mr. Kittredge, it might interest you
to know that our so-called affair...

1077
01:39:06,281 --> 01:39:09,485
...consisted of exactly two kisses
and one rather late swim.

1078
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:13,788
All of which I enjoyed and the memory of
which I wouldn't part with for anything.

1079
01:39:13,956 --> 01:39:15,414
It's no use, Mike.

1080
01:39:15,582 --> 01:39:19,247
After which I accompanied her to her
room, deposited her on the bed...

1081
01:39:19,419 --> 01:39:23,168
...and returned to you two on the porch,
which you will doubtless remember.

1082
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:26,839
You mean to say
that was all there was to it?

1083
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:28,173
I do.

1084
01:39:32,391 --> 01:39:37,136
Why? Was I so unattractive, so distant...

1085
01:39:37,312 --> 01:39:39,388
...so forbidding or cold or something?

1086
01:39:39,565 --> 01:39:43,147
- Well, this is fine talk, Tracy.
- I'm asking a question.

1087
01:39:43,318 --> 01:39:45,441
You were extremely attractive, Tracy.

1088
01:39:45,612 --> 01:39:48,732
And as for distant and forbidding,
on the contrary.

1089
01:39:48,907 --> 01:39:52,775
However, you were a little worse,
or the better, for the wine.

1090
01:39:52,953 --> 01:39:55,195
And there are rules
about things like that.

1091
01:39:55,706 --> 01:39:57,912
Oh, thank you, Mike.

1092
01:40:00,502 --> 01:40:05,248
- Oh, I think men are wonderful.
- The little dears.

1093
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:09,085
Well, this is a fine time to be telling me.

1094
01:40:09,261 --> 01:40:11,088
Why? Where's the difference?

1095
01:40:11,263 --> 01:40:16,850
If my wonderful, beautiful, marvelous
virtue is still intact, it's no thanks to me.

1096
01:40:17,019 --> 01:40:19,973
It's purely by courtesy of the gentleman
from South Bend.

1097
01:40:20,147 --> 01:40:23,017
Local papers, please copy.

1098
01:40:23,275 --> 01:40:27,189
Well, since nothing really happened...

1099
01:40:27,362 --> 01:40:30,814
...perhaps we just better
drop the whole subject.

1100
01:40:32,201 --> 01:40:38,535
George, I don't want you to marry me
because you think I'm now worthy of you.

1101
01:40:38,707 --> 01:40:45,160
It would've meant much more if you had
married me because I was unworthy.

1102
01:40:45,339 --> 01:40:50,380
- But a man expects his wife to...
- I know, to behave herself. Naturally.

1103
01:40:50,552 --> 01:40:52,675
To behave herself naturally.

1104
01:40:52,846 --> 01:40:55,598
Well, what's done is done.

1105
01:40:56,809 --> 01:40:59,050
We can't turn back the clock.

1106
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:02,180
Oh, I wished I'd have said that.

1107
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:07,350
You're at liberty to leave at any time.
I don't relish having you at my wedding.

1108
01:41:07,528 --> 01:41:10,979
Is there going to be a wedding, George?

1109
01:41:11,824 --> 01:41:13,650
Yes, Tracy.

1110
01:41:13,909 --> 01:41:19,828
In spite of the circumstances, I'm big
enough to overlook a single indiscretion.

1111
01:41:21,166 --> 01:41:25,959
No, you're too good for me, George.

1112
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:31,124
I couldn't bear a perfect man.
I'd make you most unhappy.

1113
01:41:31,301 --> 01:41:33,093
Most.

1114
01:41:33,762 --> 01:41:35,802
I know I'd try my best to.

1115
01:41:37,057 --> 01:41:39,050
She would too.

1116
01:41:40,018 --> 01:41:43,138
All right, if that's the way you feel.

1117
01:41:43,313 --> 01:41:44,428
That's that.

1118
01:41:44,606 --> 01:41:47,856
I have never begged in my life.

1119
01:41:55,159 --> 01:41:58,362
I've got a feeling you had more to do
with this than anyone.

1120
01:41:58,537 --> 01:42:01,408
- I hope you're right.
- You and your whole rotten class.

1121
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:03,989
- Oh, class my...
- Grandmother!

1122
01:42:12,301 --> 01:42:15,420
Well, there goes George.

1123
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:18,427
- Oh, my sainted aunt!
- You're on.

1124
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:20,390
- What am I gonna do?
- Say a few words.

1125
01:42:20,559 --> 01:42:22,598
- Put your hat on.
- Put it on.

1126
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:25,521
You'll think of something.
You're gonna look lovely.

1127
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:33,021
- What am I gonna do? What'll I say?
- Your father will make an announcement.

1128
01:42:33,197 --> 01:42:36,198
- Anything special you want me to say?
- Oh, thank you. No.

1129
01:42:36,366 --> 01:42:40,411
- I got myself into it, I'll get myself out.
- As you wish.

1130
01:42:42,748 --> 01:42:44,456
Go, go!

1131
01:42:46,293 --> 01:42:48,286
Hello, everybody.

1132
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:53,414
I just want to say that...

1133
01:42:53,592 --> 01:42:57,542
Oh, will you stop that racket, please?
Thank you.

1134
01:42:59,431 --> 01:43:01,424
Good morning.

1135
01:43:04,478 --> 01:43:07,016
I'd like to say...

1136
01:43:08,899 --> 01:43:11,900
Well, there's been a little hitch.

1137
01:43:12,402 --> 01:43:17,029
I've made a terrible fool of myself,
which isn't at all unusual.

1138
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:19,868
Well, my fiancé that was...

1139
01:43:20,035 --> 01:43:25,575
Well, he thinks we ought to
call it a day, and I quite agree with him.

1140
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:29,206
- Help me.
- Tell them two years ago I did you...

1141
01:43:29,378 --> 01:43:31,620
...out of a wedding
by eloping in Maryland.

1142
01:43:31,797 --> 01:43:36,459
Two years ago I did you out of a wedding
in this house by eloping to Maryland.

1143
01:43:36,635 --> 01:43:39,043
I hope to make it up now
by going through with it.

1144
01:43:39,221 --> 01:43:43,088
But I hope to make it up now
by going through with it...

1145
01:43:45,727 --> 01:43:50,105
As originally
and most beautifully planned.

1146
01:43:50,274 --> 01:43:54,402
- So if you'll just keep your seats.
- So if you'll just keep your lovely seats.

1147
01:43:54,570 --> 01:43:55,815
- That's all.
- That's all.

1148
01:43:56,864 --> 01:44:00,992
- Oh, Dexter, are you sure?
- No, but I'll risk it if you will.

1149
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:05,074
- You're not just doing it to save my face?
- It's such a nice face.

1150
01:44:05,247 --> 01:44:08,331
- Come on, Dexter, we've no time to lose.
- See you in a minute.

1151
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:10,992
Oh, Father, I'm so glad you came back.

1152
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:13,743
- I'm glad you're here.
- Thank you, Tracy.

1153
01:44:13,922 --> 01:44:17,671
And I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry,
I've been a disappointment to you.

1154
01:44:17,843 --> 01:44:20,678
I never said that, darling, and I never will.

1155
01:44:20,846 --> 01:44:22,305
I love you, Father.

1156
01:44:22,473 --> 01:44:25,046
And I love you, my daughter.

1157
01:44:25,225 --> 01:44:27,099
Help me off the pedestal.

1158
01:44:27,269 --> 01:44:32,429
Watch out for that first step.
It's quite a tumble.

1159
01:44:49,958 --> 01:44:52,247
Pretty contagious idea, isn't it?

1160
01:44:53,295 --> 01:44:57,245
Well, I must confess
I'm not exactly immune.

1161
01:44:57,508 --> 01:45:01,920
Liz, I know I'm not
destiny's dream man...

1162
01:45:03,222 --> 01:45:04,550
...but I thought maybe...

1163
01:45:04,723 --> 01:45:09,468
Oh, Mike, I think I better grab you
before somebody else does.

1164
01:45:09,645 --> 01:45:12,515
You're liable to get in trouble
one of these days.

1165
01:45:14,650 --> 01:45:17,057
Come on, we'll develop this later.

1166
01:46:09,033 --> 01:46:11,287
End of story.
