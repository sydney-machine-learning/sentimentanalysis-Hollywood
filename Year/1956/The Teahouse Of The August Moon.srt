00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,909
Tutti-frutti.

3
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,573
Most generous gift
from American sergeant.

4
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:36,779
Lovely ladies, kind gentlemen,
pleased to introduce myself.

5
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,116
Sakini by name,
interpreter by profession.

6
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,422
Education by the ancient dictionary.

7
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:49,534
Okinawan by whim of gods.

8
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:55,474
History of Okinawa reveal
distinguished record of conquerors.

9
00:02:55,642 --> 00:03:01,877
We have honor to be subjugated
in 14th century by Chinese pirates.

10
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,881
In 16th century, by English missionary.

11
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,986
In 18th century, by Japanese warlords.

12
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:12,215
And in 20th century,
by American Marine.

13
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,690
Okinawa very fortunate.

14
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,195
Culture brought to us.
Not have to leave home for it.

15
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,425
And we learn many thing.

16
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:28,063
Most important, that rest of world
not like Okinawa.

17
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:33,076
World filled with delightful variation.
Example:

18
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,477
In Okinawa, no locks on doors.

19
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,413
Bad manners not to trust neighbors.

20
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:43,488
In America, lock and key big industry.

21
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:48,423
Conclusion: Bad manners, good business.

22
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,554
Another example:

23
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,930
In Okinawa, wash self in public bath
with nude lady quite proper...

24
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:01,130
...but a picture of nude lady
in private home quite improper.

25
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:05,937
In America, statue of nude lady in park
win prize...

26
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:11,607
...but nude lady in flesh in park
win a penalty.

27
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,308
Conclusion:

28
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,946
Pornography, question of geography.

29
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:23,123
But Okinawa most eager
to be educated by conquerors.

30
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,764
Not easy to learn.

31
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,390
Sometimes very painful.

32
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,697
But pain make man think.

33
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,131
Thought make man wise.

34
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,904
And wisdom make life endurable.

35
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,445
So now...

36
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:48,849
Now we going to tell you little story
to demonstrate splendid example...

37
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:53,755
...of benevolent assimilation of democracy
by Okinawa.

38
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,986
Boss by name of Colonel Purdy III.

39
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:03,365
Number three after name indicate
he is son of a son of a son.

40
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,431
Colonel Purdy put up many sign.

41
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,167
This exceedingly civilized.

42
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,676
Make it very easy for uncivilized
to know what not to do.

43
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,610
Here laundry of officer...

44
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,480
...not to fraternize with laundry
of enlisted man.

45
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,220
This gentleman,
honorable Sergeant Gregovich...

46
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:35,891
...assistant to Colonel Purdy,
but not a son of a son of son.

47
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,368
You know what he's doing? Explanation:

48
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,101
Colonel Purdy great student of history.

49
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,711
So every month, wife of Colonel Purdy...

50
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,575
...send him magazine
called <i>Adventure Magazine.</i>

51
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,446
Cover have picture of pirate
with a black patch over eye.

52
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,053
Everyone try to steal magazine.

53
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,020
So colonel hide under desk
so he can read first...

54
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,717
...but the sergeant always find.

55
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,897
He's a smart mouse.

56
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:27,352
This gentleman,
exalted boss Colonel Purdy III.

57
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,715
Colonel very wise man.

58
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,121
Every morning look up at the sky
and make a prophecy.

59
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,221
It's not gonna rain today.

60
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,060
And you know what? Not... Not rain.

61
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,763
Of course it not rain this time of year
in whole history of Okinawa...

62
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,066
...but the colonel not make mistake.

63
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:57,114
Explanation: Army teach colonel French
for invasion of Europe...

64
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,911
...then send to Okinawa instead.

65
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:05,752
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

66
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,790
Where's my 8th pair of shorts?

67
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,521
Now colonel gonna yell loud for Sakini.

68
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,497
So I hide. I pretend
to be asleep here. So...

69
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,067
Sakini.

70
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,002
Sakini? Sakini?

71
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,971
Sakini!

72
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,413
Sakini!

73
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,539
- Sakini.
- Oh, good morning, boss.

74
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,014
You sure surprised me, boss.

75
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,952
I want you to tell me why my laundry comes
back every week with one piece missing.

76
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,092
- Gets lost, boss.
- I know it gets lost.

77
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,591
What I wanna find out
is how it gets lost.

78
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,627
Oh, very simple, boss.

79
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,561
Family take laundry
to wash in the stream...

80
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:52,193
...and while friends exchange greetings,
laundry exchange places.

81
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,772
We run down hill fast as dickens
to catch laundry, boss.

82
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,809
- Well?
- Not run fast enough.

83
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,646
No wonder you people were subjugated
by the Japanese.

84
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,682
If you're not sleeping,
you're running away from work.

85
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,114
Where's your get-up-and-go?

86
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,781
Guess get-up-and-go went, boss.

87
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,950
Well, get up and go down to the officers'
quarters and see if Captain Fisby's arrived.

88
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,925
If he has, tell him to report to me
at once. Hurry.

89
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,088
- Sakini.
- Yes, boss?

90
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,326
You are a civilian employee in the pay
of the United States Army...

91
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,300
...and should dress accordingly.
- Yeah.

92
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,336
Pull your socks up.

93
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,540
Very sorry, boss. Very sorry.

94
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,874
- Socks up. Anything more, boss?
- That'll be all.

95
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,541
Is that as fast as you can walk?

96
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:43,246
No, no, boss, but to walk any faster,
socks fall down.

97
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,423
- Good morning, sir.
- At ease.

98
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,793
I'm gonna get rid of that interpreter.
He doesn't set a good example.

99
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,403
Colonel, sir, we gotta have someone around
who speaks the language.

100
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,240
You're quite right, sergeant, quite right.

101
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,398
It isn't often I make a mistake.
When I do...

102
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,067
- It's a beaut?
- I wasn't going to say that.

103
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,180
- I was gonna say, "By George, I admit it."
- I'm sorry, sir.

104
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,748
Now, we've got a new officer
reporting this morning.

105
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,251
He's been transferred to us
from Psychological Warfare.

106
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,582
I don't suppose you happen to know
who they are.

107
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,749
Aren't they something at the rear
of the rear echelon?

108
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,521
They're just the cream
of the Army's geniuses.

109
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,130
They're just the brains
behind the fighting heart.

110
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,268
Every man Jack of them has a mind
like a steel trap.

111
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,596
We're lucky to be getting
one of their officers.

112
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,831
- I'll watch my step, sir.
- While we're waiting for Captain Fisby...

113
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,339
...I'd like you to make a note
of new signs I want.

114
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,445
The painter hasn't finished the ones
you ordered yesterday, sir.

115
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,707
There's only one answer to that:
Put on another sign painter.

116
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,111
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:50,119
Now, I noticed the men were dancing with
each other in the canteen the other night.

118
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,417
Yes, sir. "No dancing allowed."

119
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,585
I didn't say that, Gregovich.
I don't object to the men dancing.

120
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,493
I want them to enjoy themselves. It doesn't
set a good example for the natives...

121
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,328
...to see noncoms
dancing with enlisted men.

122
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,299
So have a sign posted saying:

123
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,339
"Sergeants are forbidden
to dance with privates."

124
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,610
You might as well take that memo
to the sign painter.

125
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,212
Yes, sir.

126
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,428
- Sakini here, boss.
- Don't ever put your finger on an officer.

127
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,967
- Oh, not all right, boss?
- No.

128
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,833
If you want to announce
your presence, knock.

129
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,101
Can't you natives ever learn anything
about custom?

130
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,607
What do you think you're doing?

131
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,046
Oh, not know, boss. Do what you ask.

132
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,483
Everything in this country
conspires to annoy me.

133
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,055
Well, where is Captain Fisby?

134
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:03,127
Oh, he come now, boss. I run ahead.
Socks fall down.

135
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,628
Captain Fisby reporting, sir.

136
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,065
Welcome to Team 147.

137
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,035
- I can't tell you how glad I am to have you.
- Thank you, sir.

138
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,606
Frankly, we're so desperate
for officer personnel...

139
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:20,576
...I'd be glad to see you
even if you had two heads.

140
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,771
That'll be all, Sakini.
You can wait outside.

141
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,781
- Okay.
- Sit down, captain, sit down.

142
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:30,979
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Oh, sorry, boss. I sit by door, boss.

143
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,387
- May as well be comfortable here.
- Yes.

144
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,685
Not sleep.

145
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,889
Have you unpacked?

146
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,623
Oh, yes, sir. I unpacked
as soon as I got in last night.

147
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,734
Well, that's too bad
because you'll have to pack again.

148
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,132
I am sending you to Tobiki at once.

149
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,568
We need a man of your caliber
up there right away.

150
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,332
- Well, thank you.
- I am informed...

151
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,376
...that you requested this transfer
from Psychological Warfare to my outfit.

152
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,571
- May I say that I am honored.
- Yeah.

153
00:11:55,748 --> 00:12:00,708
Well, in all fairness, sir, I think I should
tell you that I was requested to request it.

154
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,720
Oh, may I ask why?

155
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,720
Well, you see, sir...

156
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:10,157
...it seems that my... My propaganda
to undermine the enemy's morale...

157
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,298
...undermined the staff's morale instead.

158
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,299
How did you get into Psychological Warfare
in the first place?

159
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,597
- I was requested to request a transfer.
- From what?

160
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:23,105
- The Paymaster General's office.
- What was your duty there?

161
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:29,872
Well, I had charge
of the payroll-computation machine.

162
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,813
Well, until...

163
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,148
- Until what?
- Well...

164
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,887
You know, machines have always been
my mortal enemy, colonel.

165
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,892
I don't believe that they're inanimate.
They're not inanimate.

166
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,589
- They're full of malice and ill will.
- I asked you what happened, captain.

167
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,358
Yes. Yes, sir.

168
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,129
Well, this machine... This... You know,
the payroll-computation machine?

169
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,169
It made a mistake, it seems...

170
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,366
...of a quarter of a million dollars
in the payroll.

171
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:02,378
And unfortunately, the men were paid
before the mistake was discovered.

172
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:07,349
- What did they do to you?
- Oh, they gave me a job licking envelopes.

173
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,318
- And then you asked for a transfer.
- No.

174
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,821
I developed an allergy to glue.

175
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,987
How many outfits in this man's Army
have you been in, captain?

176
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,860
- Let's see, how many are there now, sir?
- Never mind.

177
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:24,127
I admit disappointment, but not defeat.

178
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,466
I thought you were given to me
in recognition of my work here.

179
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,167
Frankly, I expect to be made
a general soon.

180
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:35,040
And I want that star
for my wife's crown.

181
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,775
- Naturally, that's very hush-hush.
- Oh, yes, naturally.

182
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,818
Do you know something, sir?
Do you know something?

183
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,684
I just think that perhaps I just wasn't
cut out to be a soldier, that's all.

184
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:50,420
Captain, none of us was cut out
to be a soldier, but we do the job.

185
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,123
We adjust, we adapt,
we roll with a punch...

186
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,030
...and bring victory home in our teeth.

187
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,363
Do you know what I was
before the war?

188
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,405
A football coach?

189
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,168
I was the Purdy Paper Box Company
of Pottawatomie.

190
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,870
What did I know about foreigners?

191
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,881
But my job is to teach these natives
the meaning of democracy.

192
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,316
And they're gonna learn democracy
if I have to shoot every one of them.

193
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,517
- Yes, sir.
- What did you do before the war?

194
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,889
Oh, I was an associate professor
at Muncie.

195
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,054
- What'd you teach?
- The humanities.

196
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,792
Captain, you're finally getting a job
you're qualified by training to handle:

197
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,529
- Teaching these natives to act human.
- I don't think the humanities are that.

198
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,969
If you can teach one thing,
you can teach another.

199
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,337
This is plan B. Washington has drawn up
full instructions...

200
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,809
...pertaining to the welfare and recovery
of these native villages.

201
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:46,008
- Consider it your Bible, captain.
- Yes, sir. I'll study it very carefully.

202
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,278
There might be some questions
I'd like to ask.

203
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,547
Washington has anticipated
all your questions.

204
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,317
- Yes, but I was thinking...
- You don't even have to think.

205
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,484
This document relieves you
of that responsibility.

206
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,296
- How is your Japanese?
- Oh, not so very good.

207
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,492
- No, no. Not good, sir.
- Oh, I can see you'll need an interpreter.

208
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,261
Well, I... No, no... Sir...

209
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,371
- I've got just the man for you.
- Colonel?

210
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,767
- Colonel?
- Sakini!

211
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,876
- I could study the language, you know.
- No need, we won the war.

212
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,103
Sakini present, boss.
Socks up, not sleeping.

213
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,908
Sakini, this is Captain Fisby.

214
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,380
- We meet before, boss, you forget.
- Yeah, we met.

215
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,576
I'm assigning you to Captain Fisby.

216
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,416
He's gonna take charge of a village
at the top of Okinawa.

217
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,026
- A village called Tobiki.
- Tobiki, boss.

218
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,629
Very nice place, boss,
but not at top of Okinawa, at bottom.

219
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,630
Don't tell me where the villages
under my command are located.

220
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,598
- I happen to give a course in map reading.
- Very sorry, boss.

221
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,170
But happen to be born in Tobiki.
It's at the bottom.

222
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,775
Then it's time you learned
where you were born.

223
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,810
Oh, very sorry, boss,
but the map upside down.

224
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,310
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

225
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,711
Why doesn't the army learn
how to draw a map properly?

226
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,374
That'll be all, Sakini.

227
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,680
Find Sergeant Gregovich and have him
assign a jeep to Captain Fisby.

228
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,881
Load supplies and the captain's gear.
You'll be leaving at once.

229
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,122
I mention you in prayer to gods, boss.
I wait for you in jeep, captain.

230
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,967
I sometimes think we occupation teams
have it tougher than combat troops.

231
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,265
- Oh, now, I wouldn't say that, sir.
- They have it rough for a while.

232
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,569
But we have the killing daily grind
with no glory in it.

233
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,405
Yes, sir, I know what you mean, sir.

234
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,345
Life itself is a battlefield
with its own obscure heroes.

235
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,418
- I consider that poetry, captain.
- Oh, no, no, that's prose, colonel.

236
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,887
And it isn't mine, you know.
It's Victor Hugo.

237
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:37,188
Yes, Victor Hugo.
How I loved <i>Tale of Two Cities.</i>

238
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,696
Isn't that Dickens?
Isn't that Dickens, sir?

239
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,835
Well, to get back to Tobiki.
Your first job when you get there...

240
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,200
...will be to establish a municipal
government and to build a school.

241
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,001
Plan B calls for the schoolhouse
to be pentagon-shaped.

242
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,143
- Penta...?
- When the schoolhouse is built...

243
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,109
...you will organize a Ladies League
for Democratic Action.

244
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,770
Captain...

245
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,043
...this is a chance for you
to make a name for yourself.

246
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,948
Yes, sir, I feel that I personally...

247
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,454
...have delayed victory at least a year,
and I want to vindicate myself.

248
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,421
That's the kind of talk I like to hear.

249
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,652
- Thank you.
- Well, I won't detain you then.

250
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,796
- Yes, sir.
- My only order to you is...

251
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,864
...put that village on the map.

252
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,255
Yes, sir.

253
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,834
Send me a bimonthly progress report
in triplicate.

254
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,971
- Yes, sir.
- Don't duplicate your work.

255
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,367
No, sir. No, sir.

256
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,976
And remember that the eyes of Washington
are on our occupation teams...

257
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,271
...and the eyes of the world
are on Washington.

258
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,438
- Yes, sir. I'll keep the eyes in mind, sir.
- Goodbye, captain.

259
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,517
Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir.

260
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,118
Everything all set? We go Tobiki now?

261
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,156
Listen, I gotta get my gear
packed first.

262
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,727
All finished, boss.
I have many cousin work for Army.

263
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,365
- Where's our jeep?
- Right over there, boss.

264
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,338
- What's she doing up there?
- Oh, she nice old lady, boss.

265
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,104
She hear we go to Tobiki village,
so she think she go along to visit grandson.

266
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,447
She does? Well...

267
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,379
Well, you tell her I'm very sorry...

268
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,952
...but, you see,
this is against regulations.

269
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,681
Oh, she not fall off, boss.
She tied on good.

270
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,586
Yes. Well, you untie her, Sakini.

271
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,353
Just get up there and untie her
and tell her to get down.

272
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,929
You see, she's going to have to find
some other way to visit her grandson.

273
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,590
Boss, her grandson mayor
of Tobiki village.

274
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,737
You gonna make him lose face
you kick old grandma off jeep.

275
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,202
- You say she's the mayor's grandmother?
- Yes.

276
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,038
Well, all right. You see...
She's tied on all right, I guess, huh?

277
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,181
- So I guess we can take her.
- Sure.

278
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:41,411
- Now, look, is all this stuff here mine?
- No, most of the stuff belong to old lady.

279
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,714
She gonna stay three or four months...

280
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:49,259
...so she bring her cooking pots and bed
and a present for friend and...

281
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,089
Well, I don't... I don't... All right.

282
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,290
Look, if you see any low branches coming,
you just... You know, you yell out.

283
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,799
And... Get in there, Sakini.

284
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,337
You get in there, and give me directions
while I drive. You wanna get in?

285
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,772
No, no, can't go yet.
Old lady daughter not here, boss.

286
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,468
Wait a minute,
maybe I didn't hear you right. You say...

287
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,739
You don't mean the daughter
is coming with us.

288
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,351
Well, old lady very old, boss.
Who gonna take care of her on the trip?

289
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,249
Oh, here she come now, boss.
Right on dot.

290
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,855
I don't... Listen...

291
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,661
Will you just wait a minute?
Now, wait a minute, will you mind?

292
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,194
Tell her... Miss...

293
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,959
Sakini, will you tell her that there's no room
for anything more on this jeep.

294
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,534
Old lady must take clothes
to show friends, boss...

295
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,070
...because you make her lose face
if people think she only got one dress.

296
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,731
Miss, will you please come back?
Ask her to come back.

297
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,538
There's no room for any more bundles
on this jeep.

298
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:44,876
No, she not go get bundles, boss,
she go get children.

299
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,143
- Sakini. Sakini.
- What?

300
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,345
Look, these things
are always happening to me.

301
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,047
And I've gotta put a stop to them
someplace.

302
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:57,218
Daughter not go without children,
and old lady not go without daughter.

303
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:01,560
And if old lady not go,
mayor of Tobiki be mad with you, boss.

304
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,134
Will you wait just a minute please?

305
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,566
Don't get up on there.
Not on the hood of the...

306
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,905
Just a minute. Son. Son.
Please don't... Son.

307
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,379
Sakini, for Pete's sakes, how does
she expect me to see how to drive?

308
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,643
Oh, old lady got very good eyesight,
boss.

309
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,980
She gonna sit up there
and tell us when to turn.

310
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,487
You'll have to move over here, son,
because I...

311
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,285
Son, will you please stop...?
If you're gonna...

312
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,950
What?

313
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,128
What? What?

314
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,596
- Oh, he... He going to get goat, boss.
- Goat?

315
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,361
- You can't leave goat behind, boss.
- Just a minute!

316
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:43,474
Hold it, everybody. Now, we're gonna see
who is going to lose face right now.

317
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,134
And we're gonna see because no goat
is going to ride on this jeep.

318
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,906
- Oh, you not like goat, boss?
- No. No. No.

319
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,519
Yes, I like... I mean, I don't know... It's not
a question of whether I like the goat.

320
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:58,554
It's... I'm just sure that the colonel,
he wouldn't like it.

321
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,659
Oh, well, the children not go
without goat, boss.

322
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,691
- Mother not go without children.
- Yeah.

323
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,195
- Old lady not go without daughter.
- I know, I know.

324
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,594
And if old lady not go:

325
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,533
- Mayor of Tobiki be mad at you.
- Mayor of Tobiki will be mad at you. I know.

326
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,764
- Oh, no, no, please.
- Everyone here, boss.

327
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,138
- Goat unmarried lady goat. No children.
- No, you'll have to get down.

328
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,939
You'll never get it
off the ground, captain.

329
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,777
- Sakini, come on, we gotta get started.
- You get in, boss.

330
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,682
And no one else going, boss.
No one else is going.

331
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,619
- Wait a minute.
- Hey, you got another customer.

332
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,785
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Oh, no.

333
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,261
- Sakini! Wait. Please wait.
- What?

334
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,730
Now, who in the blazes is he?

335
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,359
Who in the blazes is he, boss?
Never see before.

336
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,871
Ask him what he's doing sitting here,
please.

337
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,074
He say he see people
going on a trip, boss.

338
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,409
- He think he like to go along too.
- No, please...

339
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:03,543
He does? Well, you tell him for me
that he's gotta get off right now.

340
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,349
Come on.

341
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,987
No, no. What?

342
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,789
Oh, he say why you not take him, boss?

343
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,294
- You take goat.
- Oh, no.

344
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,592
He say maybe you think
he not as good as goat.

345
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:20,227
Tell him for me, Sakini,
that the eyes of Washington are on...

346
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,966
The world is on Washington,
and the eyes of Washington are on me.

347
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,975
Will you just... Folks, please,
I would love to take you.

348
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,476
Folks, if this was my jeep...

349
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,343
...or if this wasn't against regulations,
I'd be only too...

350
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,006
- Captain Fisby.
- Yes, sir.

351
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,914
What do you think you're doing?

352
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,887
Well, it's hard to explain, sir. No, just...

353
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,454
What are they saying?

354
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,891
They say tell fat old man to shut up
so we can get started.

355
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,528
Which one of you men made that noise?

356
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,146
Just a second. Where are you going?
Hey, Captain Fisby. Sakini.

357
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,977
Come back here. You hear me?

358
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:37,972
No, just a minute please.
Just a minute. Which road?

359
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,585
Just a minute please, just a minute.
What did she say?

360
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,453
Old lady say, boss,
that she want to go to Awasi, boss...

361
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,393
...because she got sister she not see
in 22 half years.

362
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,158
We're on duty, Sakini,
we're not on a tour of the island.

363
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:59,531
Now, would you please just ask her for me,
which is the road to Tobiki?

364
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,269
- That way.
- This way?

365
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,138
All right, that's all I asked you.

366
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,423
All right. All right.

367
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:27,554
- Well, so this is Tobiki.
- Tobiki, no. This Awasi, boss.

368
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:31,224
I distinctly asked this lady
to tell me the way to Tobiki.

369
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,928
Well, old lady make mistake, boss.
Very sorry.

370
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,768
- Well, you know, we can't go...
- Oh, sorry, boss, but she not very smart.

371
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,535
Yeah.

372
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,350
All right, which road?

373
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,254
No, no, don't ask her. I don't trust her.

374
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:02,330
- All right. What are they saying?
- Children want to go to Yatoda, boss.

375
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,661
I suppose they've got some
cousins that they want to visit there.

376
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,271
No, ocean at Yatoda, boss.

377
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,702
Children never see ocean.

378
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,402
Our orders are to proceed
directly to Tobiki.

379
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,273
Now, which road?

380
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,681
There.

381
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,983
There. Over here, huh?

382
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,984
All right.

383
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,572
- Boss...
- No, don't tell me, this is Yatoda.

384
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,508
- How you know, boss?
- Well, I recognize the ocean.

385
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,433
Where is this? Whose uncle
or cousin lives here?

386
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,132
This Tobiki, boss.

387
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,338
- Sakini!
- I don't believe it.

388
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,572
I don't believe it.

389
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,154
Now, according to plan B...

390
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,922
...my first job here is to
hold a public meeting, Sakini.

391
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,657
You see, I want to make
certain that they understand...

392
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,063
...that I come as their friend.
- Sure.

393
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:48,035
That we intend to lift the yoke
of oppression from their shoulders.

394
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,834
They'll like that, boss.
That their favorite speech.

395
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,909
What do you mean,
their favorite speech?

396
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,706
When Japanese come,
they say same thing.

397
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,280
- Then take everything.
- No, no, no.

398
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,611
No, you don't understand.
We don't come to take anything from them.

399
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,720
We've come here
to give them something.

400
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,015
That's all right, boss. We not mind.

401
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,024
After eight centuries, we get used to it.

402
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,661
Now when friends come...

403
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,161
...we hide everything quick as dickens.

404
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,601
So I'm go tell people
you make your speech, boss.

405
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,829
So socks up, boss.

406
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,076
Everyone here eager to meet you, boss.

407
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,682
Might as well get started.

408
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,215
- Citizens of...
- Up here, boss.

409
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,875
- They'll see you.
- Thank you.

410
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,454
Citizens of Tobiki...

411
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,294
- Citizens of Tobiki village...
- Sorry, boss.

412
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,433
- Can't begin lecture yet.
- What seems to be the trouble?

413
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,864
- Not good manners, boss.
- Why?

414
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,164
Because people bring you gifts.
You must accept gifts first.

415
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,206
No, Sakini, wait a minute,
you got it all wrong.

416
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,708
I'm here to bring gifts
from my government to them.

417
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,745
No, very rude.
Make people feel poor, boss.

418
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,849
I don't want to do that. Get up, Sakini.

419
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,314
Tell them I'll accept gifts,
but in the name...

420
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,387
...of the United States
occupation forces.

421
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,987
All right?

422
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,357
Here Mr. Hokaida, boss.
He give you very nice gift.

423
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,896
Oh, thank you very, very much.
What is it?

424
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,261
That's a very splendid
cricket cage, boss.

425
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,064
- What do you use a cricket cage for?
- You keep your crickets in there.

426
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,332
No, there isn't. There's no cricket inside.

427
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,772
No, you gotta get
your own cricket, boss.

428
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,809
- No one gonna get for you.
- Oh, I see.

429
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,038
I got it, yeah. Thank you.
Thank him for me.

430
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,480
Tell him I'll keep
my eye open for a cricket.

431
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,085
Yeah. What do you keep a
cricket in a cage for?

432
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,087
So fortune smile on you, boss.
A cricket very good luck.

433
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,782
- Oh, that's nice.
- Boss, here Mr. Omura.

434
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,757
He give you chopstick.

435
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,424
- What did he say?
- He say hope that only food...

436
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,694
...of gods touch your lips.
- No, that's... That's very nice.

437
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,861
That's one of the
nicest things I've heard.

438
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:37,007
- Boss, Mr. Seiko.
- Yes?

439
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,043
Thank you.

440
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:47,049
That's wooden sandal, boss,
very comfortable for tired feet.

441
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,277
He say may you walk in prosperity.

442
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:54,153
You tell him that I will walk in the
cool meadow of pleasant memories.

443
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,855
- What's the matter? Is that all right?
- Oh, boss, that's very pretty, boss.

444
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:04,463
Thank you. That's all right.
Thank you very much.

445
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,297
- And, boss, here Miss Higa Jiga.
- Hi.

446
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,938
She unmarried lady, boss.

447
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,630
She give you three eggs.

448
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,605
Isn't that nice?

449
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,609
Yes... No, tell her that I'll have
these eggs for breakfast.

450
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,371
You tell her.

451
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,575
Yeah, yeah.

452
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,842
Chicken and the eggs, huh?

453
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,044
She hope you gonna enjoy
your turtle egg, boss.

454
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,486
- Turtle eggs? Oh, my.
- Yes.

455
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,222
Oh, you very big success, boss.
They sure like you already.

456
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,626
Oh, I'm... Yes. Turtle eggs?

457
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,358
- This Mr. Oshira, boss.
- Hold these for me, Sakini.

458
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:37,796
I'm getting a bit too much.

459
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,870
He give you a very nice
lacquered cup, boss.

460
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,438
He make that cup hisself.

461
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,598
No, he didn't.
Well, you thank him for me...

462
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:48,769
...and tell him that I'll be forever indebted
to him for his very lovely gift.

463
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,881
You are most welcome, captain.

464
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,340
Hey, you speak English.

465
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,545
Sure, boss, Mr. Oshira teach me
English when I'm a little boy in Tobiki.

466
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,953
- How do you like...?
- In my youth, I work in Manila.

467
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,685
How is Mr. McKinley?

468
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,853
Oh, you mean President McKinley?

469
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,793
Well, I'm afraid somebody shot him.

470
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,491
- I am sorry.
- Well, it was a long time ago, you know.

471
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,028
Yes, a long time.

472
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,134
May August moon fill your cup.

473
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,036
Why an August moon, sir?

474
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:24,114
All moons good, but August
moon little older, little wiser.

475
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:28,013
Is it...? Sakini said that you
made this cup all by yourself.

476
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,019
- Oh, yes.
- You know that this is a lost art, Sakini.

477
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:35,250
This is an industry we could start
right here, right now in Tobiki.

478
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,122
- Think you could mass-produce these?
- Mass-produce?

479
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,129
Yes, you know, set up machines,
turn them out by the gross.

480
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,264
I take pride in making
one cup at a time, captain.

481
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,463
How many do you think
you could turn out in, oh, say, one day?

482
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:54,911
If I work hard,
maybe one or two a week.

483
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,543
Fine, that's good,
you make as many as you can.

484
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,512
We'll send them up
to the Post Exchange.

485
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,845
And sell them as fast
as you can turn them out.

486
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,453
I shall do my best.

487
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,586
Fine. We're in business. Now, Mr. Hokaida,
you make those cricket cages...

488
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,091
...and the getas, fine,
we can sell a lot of those.

489
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,354
And the chopsticks, great.
A lot of those.

490
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,398
And I saw some straw hats.
See those straw hats? Make a lot of those.

491
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,865
We're going into
the souvenir business, folks.

492
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,265
We gonna make money, boss?

493
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,668
Make enough of these,
I'll guarantee recovery...

494
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,308
...of Tobiki village. You tell them that.

495
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,980
Oh, boss, you very big success.
They sure like you already, boss.

496
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,710
And they say they will make
everything fast as dickens.

497
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,286
Sakini, ask them to postpone
any more gifts for now.

498
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,719
I wanna tell them
what we're going to do for them.

499
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,017
Okay.

500
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,589
What?

501
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:49,555
Okay. They say okay, boss. They got
no more presents for you anyhow.

502
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,294
It's important that I tell them
about the schoolhouse...

503
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,529
...that we'll build for their children.

504
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:58,733
Now, according to plan B, I believe it says
the direct approach is the most effective.

505
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,572
- So you ready?
- Oh, all set, boss.

506
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,646
Do you want to be ignorant?

507
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,542
- What? What was that?
- They say yes, boss.

508
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,587
Yes? You mean they
want to be ignorant?

509
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,089
Oh, no, boss. Oh, in Japanese, boss,
yes mean no.

510
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,023
They say, "Yes, we not
want to be ignorant."

511
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,630
Oh, I see.

512
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,665
Do you want your children
to be ignorant?

513
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,366
Now, what was that?

514
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,734
They say no, boss.

515
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,375
No? Wait a minute now.

516
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,443
Sakini, no, they do? Or no, they don't?

517
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,911
Yes, boss. They not want
no ignorant children.

518
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,743
Right. Now...

519
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:44,479
...there's gonna be a daily issue
of rice for everybody here.

520
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,856
Yes, yes. And we're gonna build
a fine new schoolhouse...

521
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,997
...for your children.

522
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,098
Wait. Pentagon-shaped.

523
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,165
Pentagon.

524
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,571
Pentagon.

525
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,100
She say, "What is a pentagon?"
Boss, they never hear before.

526
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,143
They've never heard of the Pentagon?

527
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,577
- No, boss.
- They certainly do need a school here.

528
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,876
Pentagon. Everybody knows
what the Pentagon is.

529
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,453
The P... It's...

530
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,955
Well, it really means
five-sided, you know, Sakini.

531
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,423
- Five-sided?
- Yes, it has five si...

532
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:41,702
They say... Boss, they say there are no
children in Tobiki got the five sides.

533
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,870
No, no, the school.

534
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:47,108
The school has five sides,
not the children. I mean, not in re...

535
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,845
No, you see, it's like a building
in Washington, folks.

536
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,218
And everybody is gonna
learn about democracy.

537
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:02,021
They say, "What is a democracy?" boss.
They know what rice is.

538
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,863
Yes, all right. Democracy is a
system of self-determination.

539
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:09,234
It's the... It's the right
to make the wrong choice.

540
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,008
Wait a minute, we're not
getting through to them.

541
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,408
Let me explain it this way.

542
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:21,518
Suppose I'm back home and I don't like
the way that Uncle Sam is treating me.

543
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,415
Well, do you know what I can do?

544
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:27,456
I can write to the president himself,
and I can tell him so.

545
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:37,233
They say, "But do you send
that letter?" boss.

546
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,802
- Let's get on with the lecture now.
- Okay.

547
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,269
Now we'll show you
how democracy really operates.

548
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,102
We'll hold an election.
We're gonna organize this village.

549
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,642
- Is the mayor here?
- Here's the mayor. White coat.

550
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,838
We'll have to get him a new coat.
We wouldn't want a new mayor.

551
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,210
Keep the mayor.
Very hard to find a white coat.

552
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,545
We got the mayor.
Now we need a chief of police.

553
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,486
And a chief of agriculture. Now who'd
make a good chief of agriculture here?

554
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,660
They say they like Mr. Seiko.
He the best man for the job.

555
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,062
- He's an experienced farmer?
- He artist, boss.

556
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,532
- What?
- He artist. He draw lovely picture...

557
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,364
...of golden wheat, butterfly...

558
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,474
Sakini, just because he draws
a very nice picture of wheat...

559
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,770
...that doesn't make him
an experienced wheat farmer.

560
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,176
Wheat not grow here anyhow,
just sweet potatoes.

561
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:29,616
All right. Well, if he's their choice. Fine.
Now, we're gonna have to have...

562
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:34,120
- What did he say?
- He want a white coat like mayor, boss.

563
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,989
You said that we can't get... That's all right.
If we don't get a white coat...

564
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:43,099
You know what we'll do? We'll get him
a helmet, and have written on the helmet:

565
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,132
"Chief of agriculture."

566
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,298
Now... Right, fine.
Now, we need a chief of police.

567
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,000
Now, who'd make a good chief
of police?

568
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,313
Hokaida, boss. They say they like
Mr. Hokaida. He champion wrestler.

569
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,474
- They afraid of him.
- Yeah.

570
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,142
- That's all right.
- Strong, boss.

571
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,779
Yes, indeed. All right, Fine.
Now we gotta... What?

572
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,482
- What'd he say?
- He want a helmet.

573
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,685
Oh, fine, sure, we'll requisition
a helmet for him too.

574
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,796
All right? Fine. Now for the ladies.

575
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,557
Now, we're gonna organize...

576
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,200
...a... I know what it is...

577
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,734
...it's a Ladies League
for Democratic Action...

578
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,236
...and we're gonna have to
have a league president.

579
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,306
Now, who'd make
a good league president...

580
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,909
...for the Ladies League
for Democratic Action?

581
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,342
The ladies like that.
They never vote before.

582
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,071
Fine.

583
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:38,352
Higa Jiga. They say they want Higa Jiga.
She gonna make a classy president.

584
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,417
I'm sure.

585
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,385
What?

586
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,258
Yes, I know. No, never mind.
I understand.

587
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,331
Tell her I'll get her a helmet too.
Yeah, all right, fine.

588
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,799
Yes, fine, all right. Fine. Now, now.

589
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,528
I've been talking a long time.

590
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:59,404
Folks, I'll bet you there are questions
you'd like to ask me. Ask them, Sakini.

591
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,741
Oh, she say, "What time it is?" boss.

592
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,285
Time? It's quarter to 5. Why?

593
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,856
Oh, they got to go then, boss.
They not want to miss sunset.

594
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,723
Every afternoon they like to go sit
in the pine grove and sip tea...

595
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,363
...watch the sun go down.

596
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:24,126
Isn't that nice. All right, Sakini,
you thank them all for me and tell them...

597
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:28,466
...they can go to the pine grove and
sip tea and watch the sun go down.

598
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,968
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

599
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,738
Thank you very much.

600
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:37,938
Thank you.

601
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,618
How do you think we did?

602
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,455
Oh, they cooperate, boss.
Future look very rosy.

603
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,324
I wonder where I can find a cricket.

604
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,965
Well, maybe have cricket
in your house now, not know.

605
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,930
- I'll take these.
- Okay.

606
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,161
- Thanks, Sakini.
- Sure.

607
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,671
- I'll be right here you want me, boss.
- Right.

608
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,117
Yes?

609
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,583
- You busy, boss?
- No. What is it, Sakini?

610
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:54,623
Boss, Mr. Sumata leave
a present for you.

611
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,260
Put it on the shelf where it
will be out of the way.

612
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,419
Not able to, boss, the present get mad.

613
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,189
What?

614
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,703
- Who's she?
- Souvenir.

615
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,601
What...? What are you talking about?

616
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,799
This the present from Mr. Sumata, boss.

617
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,412
Introducing Lotus Blossom,
geisha girl first-class.

618
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,912
America-san, Captain Fisby.

619
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,750
She say she very happy
to belong to handsome captain.

620
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,589
- She say she gonna serve you well.
- She's not gonna serve me at all.

621
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,494
I want you to get your friend. I want
you to tell him I'm returning his gift.

622
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,101
- Impossible to do, boss.
- Why?

623
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,898
Mr. Sumata go to mountain, visit cousin.

624
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:46,668
He leave present for you and
wish you very best success in Tobiki.

625
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,469
What? What did she say?

626
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,444
She said she want know where
you want her to stay, boss.

627
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:55,881
I d... I don't care where she stays,
but she can't stay here.

628
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:59,489
Where she go, boss?
She got no home now.

629
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,453
- Look... Wait a minute.
- She want to put your kimono on for you.

630
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,087
- She trained to please you.
- I know what she's trained to do.

631
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,564
And I don't need any translation there.

632
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,193
Now, you get my stuff
out of the supply shack...

633
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:18,603
...and you... You know,
and we'll put her up over there.

634
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:22,308
Not very democratic, boss.
You make her lose face.

635
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,643
- She think she bad geisha girl.
- I've got a bit of face to save.

636
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:31,277
Now, don't give me any of that
Oriental hanky-panky business, you know.

637
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,987
All right, what...? What's she saying?

638
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,461
Oh, she say for me
to go home to grandpa, boss.

639
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,691
She first-class geisha girl.

640
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,961
She know her business.

641
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,603
- Good night, boss.
- Sakini?

642
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,676
This is all a big mistake. You kn...

643
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,070
S... Sakini.

644
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,082
- Me.
- Me.

645
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,776
- Me, no.
- Me, no.

646
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,016
No, this is not a kimono.
This is a bathrobe...

647
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,216
...and I don't want to put it on, you see?

648
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,724
Sakini!

649
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,958
This is against regulations.

650
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,059
Hello!

651
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,937
You don't have to shout. I can hear you.

652
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,804
- This is Colonel Purdy.
- Yes, sir.

653
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,140
<i>Just thought I'd check up on you.</i>
<i>How are things going?</i>

654
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,679
<i>Anything I can do for you?</i>

655
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,976
I can't think of a thing, sir.

656
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,787
<i>I realize it's bound to get</i>
<i>lonely for you down there.</i>

657
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,821
<i>So you know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do, my boy?</i>

658
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,960
- Now, what are you gonna do?
- <i>I'll tell you.</i>

659
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,689
<i>I'm gonna send you some of</i>
<i>my old</i> Adventure <i>magazines.</i>

660
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,493
No, I don't want them.

661
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,636
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir, very much.

662
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:56,739
I would like something to read, sir.

663
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,171
<i>How are you getting</i>
<i>along with the natives?</i>

664
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,004
Well, it's an age-old problem, sir.

665
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:05,308
It's a question... Or a struggle to see
who's going to lose face.

666
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,813
<i>I understand.</i>

667
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:11,751
As Mrs. Purdy says, "East is East, and
West is West and there can be no twain."

668
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,016
<i>But you are making progress?</i>

669
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:17,183
Well, nothing that I'd like
to put on paper, sir.

670
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:20,524
<i>Well, send in a detailed progress report.</i>

671
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,690
Well, if that's what
you'd like me to do, sir. Yes, sir.

672
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:28,702
<i>You'll find that these people lack</i>
<i>the capacity for sustained endeavor.</i>

673
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,840
<i>Don't hesitate to build a fire under them.</i>

674
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,636
I don't think that that
will be necessary, sir.

675
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:37,474
<i>Don't forget, the eyes of</i>
<i>Washington are on you, Fisby.</i>

676
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,775
Oh, I hope not, sir.

677
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:45,420
<i>It just occurred to me. Have you given</i>
<i>any thought to physical education?</i>

678
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,989
Well, I don't think that...

679
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,854
You know, sir, that was a
masterpiece of timeliness, sir.

680
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,326
<i>Thank you, my boy.</i>

681
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,626
<i>Could you use a deck of cards?</i>

682
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:00,102
Sir, I...

683
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,432
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

684
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,872
<i>Fisby, you're getting weak.</i>

685
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,069
No. No.

686
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,375
Well, be good, my boy.

687
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,176
Keep up the good fight.

688
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,909
Bye-bye.

689
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:22,519
No.

690
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,854
No, wait.

691
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,545
Sakini!

692
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,722
Sakini!

693
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,661
Good morning, good morning, listen...

694
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,893
...do you know where Sakini lives?

695
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,833
Good morning.
Do you know where S...?

696
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,806
Do you know where my chief of police...?
Do you know...?

697
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:13,966
Do you know where my chief
of police is? My chief of agricul...

698
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,449
Sakini!

699
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,478
Oh, boss. Say, where you been?
Been looking all over for you.

700
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,385
Where have you been?
Now, where's my chief of agriculture?

701
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,685
There's not a man
working this morning, Sakini.

702
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,657
Look around for yourself. Not a man...

703
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,560
Wait a second, boss. Lotus Blossom
leave all her things at Awasi, boss.

704
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:39,533
She got no way to come here, boss,
so everyone take a wheelbarrow...

705
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,568
...and go help bring Lotus Blossom.

706
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,573
Do you mean to tell me that she has
so much stuff, it takes my entire staff...

707
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,473
...to move this woman...?
This girl to my village?

708
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,842
No, boss, but chief of police
not trust chief of agriculture...

709
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,483
- No.
...and Mr. Mayor not trust Mr. Oshira...

710
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,848
...so all got to go, boss.
- Oh, I see.

711
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,123
Mr. Oshira? That old man?

712
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,453
He old, boss, but he not dead.

713
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:08,223
Well, that's a fine way for a... That's a
great way for officials to act. That's...

714
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,696
As soon as they get back,
I want to see them.

715
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,426
Okay, boss.

716
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,479
- What's going on?
- I don't know, boss.

717
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,750
- What's the trouble?
- Don't know, boss.

718
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:19,823
You know what they say?

719
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,261
They say they got
discrimination here, boss.

720
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,629
Discrimination? Where? Where?

721
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,269
Boss. Hey, boss, she gonna tell.

722
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,771
- Lookit...
- She gonna show you, boss.

723
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,143
- She gonna show you. They'll wait...
- All right.

724
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,847
They're waiting for the rice, boss.

725
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,425
- Yes?
- At the rice place.

726
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,530
Lotus Blossom come along.

727
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,330
- That's Lotus Blossom?
- That's Lotus Blossom.

728
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:09,376
Ration clerk come out there.

729
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,587
All right, all right. Listen... No.

730
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:22,986
I wish you wouldn't use...

731
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,823
No, boss. She still use it.
She the ration clerk.

732
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,028
He invite her in.

733
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:33,861
Wait.

734
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,437
Look, wait a minute! Look.

735
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,871
This is what undermines
the democratic ideal.

736
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:43,843
You tell her that I intend to do
something about it. You tell her.

737
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,714
No. Wait a minute. Wait.

738
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,946
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

739
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:55,216
Just... Now, wait a minute,
I'm gonna see right now...

740
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,792
...we'll have to get rid
of this disrupting factor...

741
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,293
...in our recovery program.

742
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,430
- McEvoy at Awasi, please.
- What you gonna do, boss?

743
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,094
This village isn't big enough
for plan B and a geisha.

744
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,934
Tobiki never have a geisha girl before.
We like very much.

745
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,600
She's got to go, she's... No.

746
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:19,374
Major McEvoy?
This is Captain Fisby at Tobiki.

747
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,914
Just a moment.

748
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:26,454
I have a request, sir, from one of my people
to transfer to your village.

749
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:30,684
It's... Yes, sir. It's a female citizen, sir.

750
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:32,884
Her job?

751
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:36,590
Boss, please, do not make her go.
Not democratic, boss.

752
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,497
Yes, as a matter of fact.

753
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:44,936
Yes, her name is Lotus Blossom, major.
How did you know?

754
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:48,976
No, no, sir. No, sir, I am not trying
to put anything over on you, sir.

755
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,638
It's... Major...

756
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,677
Oh, you did?

757
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,412
Oh, you did?

758
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,589
Oh, he know Lotus Blossom, boss?

759
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:08,663
Yes, you know something?

760
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:12,427
As a matter of fact,
Lotus Blossom was at Awasi.

761
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,866
Nearly wrecked his plan for recovery.

762
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,006
"Ah, so." Don't give me that, "Ah, so."

763
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:21,235
Listen. Do you know that she has been
booted out of every village...

764
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,402
...by every commander on the island?

765
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:28,244
- Oh, poor little Lotus Blossom.
- Oh, poor little Lotus Blossom.

766
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,445
Now I know why Mr. Sumata, or whatever
his name is just... off he goes, disappears.

767
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:33,987
I know why. I know.

768
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:37,183
The major gave him 100 yen
to get that girl out of that village.

769
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,625
Well, by golly, she's not gonna cause
any dissension here. No.

770
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,430
Ladies. Ladies. Ladies.

771
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,096
Close the door. Close the door. Wait.

772
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,732
Ladies. Ladies. Ladies. Hey, ladies.

773
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:57,505
Just a minute, please.
All right, just one minute.

774
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,342
Please, just...

775
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:00,983
What is it you want, ma'am?

776
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,451
She say she waiting
for some democratic action, boss.

777
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,215
And if she don't get it, boss...

778
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,723
...she gonna write this Uncle Sammy
you talk about.

779
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,657
Wait, no, we don't want to do that.

780
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,162
We don't want letters going to
Washington about any trouble around here.

781
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,734
The discrimination,
which all these lovely ladies have been...

782
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,894
...worried about.
We're gonna take care...

783
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,302
We'll take care of it,
it'll be taken care of.

784
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,549
Oh, no, she say please
not eliminate discrimination, boss.

785
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,652
Just give her some.

786
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,754
Now, what does she mean by that?

787
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:42,551
She say Lotus Blossom
unfair competition.

788
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,091
Oh, well, granted.

789
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:47,458
And she say you promise
that everyone gonna be equal, boss.

790
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,997
And I intend to keep my word.

791
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,998
But she say she can't be equal, boss...

792
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,627
...unless she have everything
Lotus Blossom have.

793
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:58,831
What Lotus Blossom has
the government doesn't issue.

794
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,775
All right, all right.

795
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,741
Yes, just a minute now.
What is this?

796
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:12,252
She say she want you to get her
and the Ladies League the following items:

797
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:17,382
A, red stuff to put on lips like geisha girl.
B, stuff that smell very nice.

798
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,859
What do you think
the Post Exchange would think...

799
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,897
...if I put in a requisition for lipstick?
This is ridiculous.

800
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,027
This, I can't do.

801
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,571
- Now what?
- Oh, she say...

802
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,868
...she think she gonna have to write
this Uncle Sam after all, boss.

803
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,841
No, you don't...

804
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,412
Wait a minute.
Ladies, wait a minute, please.

805
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,743
Ladies, ladies,
please, will you come back?

806
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,441
You, ladies, just come back here.

807
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,087
Look, no, just one. Look, sit down.

808
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,847
You, sit down. Come on. Here now.

809
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,820
There's a nice girl. Sit down.

810
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,823
The rest of you... Don't... Please don't.

811
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,758
Now, will you explain...?
Sakini, listen very carefully.

812
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,898
Will you...? Oh, my.

813
00:53:56,066 --> 00:54:01,299
Just explain to her that I will phone
the Post Exchange at Awasi...

814
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,372
...and I will see if I can't get some...

815
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,135
I'll get some talcum powder,
and some shaving lotion.

816
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,538
You know, tell her.

817
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,174
Yeah. All right?

818
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,915
Yeah?

819
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,215
Yeah, it's all right. Yes?

820
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,959
What now? What did she say?

821
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,093
Oh, she say one more thing, boss.

822
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:31,098
She say she want you to get Lotus Blossom
to teach all the ladies...

...to be geisha girl.

825
00:54:34,655 --> 00:54:38,489
No. No. No.

826
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:41,822
No. No.

827
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:16,155
Fisby<i>- san!</i>

828
00:56:21,228 --> 00:56:25,324
Oh, boss, look who's here.
Lotus Blossom come to see you.

829
00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:28,662
All right, now.
Where have you been all day?

830
00:56:28,836 --> 00:56:30,827
Oh, don't bother to tell me. I know.

831
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:33,098
You've been out, upsetting the agri...

832
00:56:33,274 --> 00:56:36,175
Oh, no, upsetting
the agricultural horsecart?

833
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,946
Oh, she say sun burst through clouds
now that you smile on her, boss.

834
00:56:43,117 --> 00:56:44,482
I'm not smiling.

835
00:56:47,788 --> 00:56:50,188
- Oh, boss, you know what she give you?
- The works.

836
00:56:50,357 --> 00:56:54,657
No, when lady give a gentleman
chrysanthemum bud in Okinawa...

837
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:57,263
...that mean that her heart
ready to unfold.

838
00:56:57,431 --> 00:57:00,491
Well, this is one bud
that's not going to bloom.

839
00:57:04,305 --> 00:57:05,863
Now, what's this?

840
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,304
She want to know
if you want some <i>tsukemono,</i> boss.

841
00:57:08,476 --> 00:57:10,501
- No.
- «i»Tsukemono</i> good to eat between meals.

842
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:13,704
No, no, no.

843
00:57:17,284 --> 00:57:19,252
Will you...?
Will you, please...? Will you...?

844
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,752
Tell her to leave my feet alone.

845
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:24,853
What?

846
00:57:27,628 --> 00:57:28,993
She very worried about you.

847
00:57:29,163 --> 00:57:31,961
Now, when you go out in hot sun,
you must wear <i>kasa</i> on head.

848
00:57:32,132 --> 00:57:36,501
Well, you know something, you tell her to
stop worrying about my head and my feet...

849
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,867
...and one thing very important,
she's just got to stop...

850
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,134
...interfering with my recovery program.

851
00:57:44,812 --> 00:57:48,873
- Do you want some tea, boss?
- No, I don't. No, no, no.

852
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:53,716
- Oh, you want to hear some music, boss?
- No. No, I don't...

853
00:57:55,256 --> 00:57:57,156
She say you jealous, boss.

854
00:58:01,529 --> 00:58:04,896
- You want to tell her your trouble, boss?
- Tell her my...? What?

855
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,158
What do I want
to tell her my troubles for?

856
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:09,495
Oh, she geisha girl, boss,
that's her business.

857
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:12,161
Yeah, some business. Some business.

858
00:58:15,009 --> 00:58:17,000
Oh, she very sad, boss.

859
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:20,010
She want to help you because she...

860
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,307
She say you best boss she ever have.

861
00:58:22,483 --> 00:58:27,386
You not take money from her.
You not make her work.

862
00:58:28,889 --> 00:58:31,915
Do you mean to tell me
that the men who owned her...

863
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:35,493
...hired her out and then...?
And they took money from her?

864
00:58:35,663 --> 00:58:37,028
Oh, sure, boss.

865
00:58:37,197 --> 00:58:38,892
Oh, well, now, really. I mean...

866
00:58:39,066 --> 00:58:42,866
You know, where I come from,
the men who do that sort of thing...

867
00:58:43,037 --> 00:58:45,938
Oh, you got the geisha business
in America too, boss?

868
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,666
No, but... Well, I mean...

869
00:58:48,842 --> 00:58:54,007
Look, will you please explain to her
I have no intention of making her work...

870
00:58:54,181 --> 00:58:57,514
...and I'm certainly not going
to take any money away from her.

871
00:58:57,685 --> 00:58:59,880
- I mean, that's...
- Why not, boss?

872
00:59:00,054 --> 00:59:03,046
She pay dues to geisha guild.
She member in good standing.

873
00:59:03,223 --> 00:59:06,852
This is really... I mean this is
the most immoral thing I've ever heard of.

874
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:09,086
No, I mean, I don't say, Sakini...

875
00:59:09,263 --> 00:59:12,596
...that where I come from
we don't have...

876
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:19,530
Well, you know. But, I mean,
by golly, we don't have unions.

877
00:59:19,707 --> 00:59:22,073
And we don't set rates
and we don't collect dues.

878
00:59:22,242 --> 00:59:24,107
No, no, boss, no.

879
00:59:24,278 --> 00:59:26,610
- Geisha girl not do what you think.
- Wait a minute.

880
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,338
Everybody knows what they do.

881
00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:30,983
Oh, no, everybody wrong, boss.

882
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,244
What do they pay her for?

883
00:59:34,588 --> 00:59:37,648
Well, very hard to explain, boss.

884
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:41,189
Poor man like to feel rich.

885
00:59:41,362 --> 00:59:44,388
Rich man like to feel wise.

886
00:59:44,565 --> 00:59:45,930
Sad man like to feel happy.

887
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,763
So all go to geisha house
and tell trouble to geisha girl.

888
00:59:49,937 --> 00:59:53,464
Now, she listen very politely.

889
00:59:53,641 --> 00:59:57,042
She say, "Oh, that's too bad, boss."

890
00:59:57,211 --> 00:59:58,542
She very pretty.

891
00:59:58,712 --> 01:00:03,706
She make tea, and she sing,
and she dance, boss.

892
01:00:03,884 --> 01:00:06,717
Pretty soon, troubles go away, boss.

893
01:00:06,887 --> 01:00:10,220
So that not worth something, boss?

894
01:00:14,728 --> 01:00:19,324
Sakini, I apologize to you,
I really apologize.

895
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,095
I'm very glad you cleared things up.

896
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:27,138
That's kind of...
That kind of puts a new light on things.

897
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:34,041
She say... She say why you smile
at her all of a sudden, boss?

898
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,512
You mad or something?

899
01:00:36,684 --> 01:00:39,517
Sakini, will you ask her...

900
01:00:39,687 --> 01:00:43,623
...if she'd be kind enough
to give geisha lessons...

901
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:47,488
...to the Ladies League
for Democratic Action?

902
01:01:15,055 --> 01:01:16,579
Boss.

903
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,588
Oh, boss.

904
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,398
They all come to see you, boss.

905
01:01:25,566 --> 01:01:26,794
Oh, what can I do for them?

906
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:31,165
Oh, they have a meeting in democratic
fashion and majority agree on resolution.

907
01:01:31,338 --> 01:01:33,829
They want you to build them a <i>chaya.</i>

908
01:01:34,007 --> 01:01:35,872
A what?

909
01:01:36,043 --> 01:01:37,806
- A teahouse, boss.
- A teahouse?

910
01:01:37,978 --> 01:01:41,243
Sure, now that Tobiki got
the geisha girl like big city, boss...

911
01:01:41,415 --> 01:01:43,781
...they want a teahouse like big city too.

912
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:47,352
They say you give Ladies League
what they want, boss.

913
01:01:47,521 --> 01:01:50,149
I can't build a teahouse.
I have no authority to do that.

914
01:01:50,324 --> 01:01:53,782
You say rule of majority is law, boss.
You gonna break the law?

915
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,519
No, I'm not going to break...

916
01:02:01,335 --> 01:02:04,099
Well, look, they're going
to have a school, you see.

917
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:05,863
Now, that's enough.

918
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:09,600
Oh, school. Well, majority too old
to go to school, boss.

919
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:11,642
They want to have <i>chaya,</i> a teahouse.

920
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:15,145
We haven't got the materials
to build a teahouse.

921
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:22,512
- What did she say?
- Oh, she say yesterday...

922
01:02:22,689 --> 01:02:26,853
...big Army truck come and leave lovely
lumber and beautiful paint, boss.

923
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:30,019
That's right. It's for the schoolhouse.
It just can't be done.

924
01:02:30,197 --> 01:02:32,131
- Oh, okay.
- No, it just can't.

925
01:02:36,537 --> 01:02:42,134
They say you very mean to them, boss,
after present... They give you everything.

926
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:45,938
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, folks.
I'm really very sorry.

927
01:02:46,246 --> 01:02:52,082
Oh, they very sorry too, boss,
because Tobiki like to be proud, boss.

928
01:02:52,252 --> 01:02:53,810
Teahouse give them a face.

929
01:02:54,922 --> 01:02:58,688
It's going to be a fine school. Five sides.

930
01:02:58,892 --> 01:03:02,089
- May I speak, captain-san?
- Yes, of course, Mr. Oshira.

931
01:03:02,262 --> 01:03:06,494
There are lovely teahouses
in the big cities...

932
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:11,798
...but the men of Tobiki
have never been inside them.

933
01:03:11,972 --> 01:03:14,133
We are too poor.

934
01:03:14,308 --> 01:03:20,770
All of my life I have dreamed
of visiting a teahouse...

935
01:03:20,948 --> 01:03:27,353
...where paper lanterns cast a light
in the lotus pond...

936
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:33,891
...and the bamboo bells hanging in the pines
tinkle as the breezes brush them.

937
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:39,422
But this picture is only in my heart.

938
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,761
I may never see it.

939
01:03:41,935 --> 01:03:46,565
I am an old man, sir. I shall die soon.

940
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:51,309
It is evil for the soul
to depart this world...

941
01:03:51,478 --> 01:03:54,504
...laden with envy or regret.

942
01:03:55,115 --> 01:03:58,642
Give us our teahouse, sir.

943
01:03:58,819 --> 01:04:01,185
Free my soul for death.

944
01:04:08,629 --> 01:04:11,223
Well, we haven't any carpenters.

945
01:04:12,966 --> 01:04:15,867
Daiku-san! Daiku-san!

946
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:25,202
Oh, boss, what you think?

947
01:04:25,379 --> 01:04:30,908
Mr. Sumata and the papa-san
just come down from mountain right now.

948
01:04:34,922 --> 01:04:37,914
All right, all right, I haven't got a chance.

949
01:04:38,425 --> 01:04:42,156
I guess Uncle Sam is going
into the teahouse business.

950
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:50,770
Captain Fisby.

951
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:55,535
Uncle Sam.

952
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,891
Thank you.

953
01:05:18,065 --> 01:05:19,293
Captain Fisby.

954
01:05:19,466 --> 01:05:21,934
<i>Hello. This is Colonel Purdy.</i>

955
01:05:22,102 --> 01:05:23,660
Yes, sir. How are you, colonel?

956
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:26,503
I want to talk to you
about your progress report.

957
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:29,506
There's nothing about the schoolhouse.
Did you get the lumber?

958
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,941
Yes, sir. As a matter of fact,
we're using it out there now, sir.

959
01:05:33,113 --> 01:05:36,139
But, colonel, I think we're gonna
have to have some more.

960
01:05:36,316 --> 01:05:39,774
<i>I sent ample according to specifications.</i>
<i>How big a structure you building?</i>

961
01:05:39,953 --> 01:05:43,354
Well, sir, we have to consider expansion,
you know, population increase.

962
01:05:43,557 --> 01:05:45,252
We don't need to consider expansion.

963
01:05:45,425 --> 01:05:47,950
Our troops will be out
of there by the next generation.

964
01:05:48,128 --> 01:05:52,656
Which brings me to another point. What's
this about six kids being born last week?

965
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,926
Well, it's the only thing
to fill the progress report with, sir.

966
01:05:56,136 --> 01:05:58,195
Then you've failed
at your indoctrination.

967
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:01,307
Don't you know births are entered
under population increases?

968
01:06:01,475 --> 01:06:03,033
They're not considered progress.

969
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:07,340
No, not children, sir. Kids. Goats.

970
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:11,547
Something's wrong with this connection.
It sounded just as if you said "goats."

971
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,883
You see, I'm trying to increase
the livestock down here.

972
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:19,151
Goats? Look, Fisby, suppose some
congressman flew in to inspect our team.

973
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:21,817
How would I explain
such a report about goats?

974
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:24,361
<i>The population</i>
<i>of civilians alone concerns us.</i>

975
01:06:24,531 --> 01:06:28,934
<i>I want to know exactly what progress</i>
<i>you've made as outlined in plan B.</i>

976
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:33,004
- Well, sir, I'm getting along with the people.
- «i»In other words, nothing.</i>

977
01:06:33,306 --> 01:06:36,639
Listen, Fisby, do you know what
Major McEvoy has accomplished in Awasi?

978
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:38,641
- «i»No, sir.</i>
- Then I'll tell you.

979
01:06:38,812 --> 01:06:41,781
His fourth graders know
the alphabet through M.

980
01:06:41,948 --> 01:06:45,884
His whole village can sing
"God Bless America" in English.

981
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:47,880
I wish I could say the same.

982
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:51,751
Well, see that you do. I don't want
any rotten apples in my barrel.

983
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:54,917
I want to know exactly what
you've accomplished in five weeks.

984
01:06:55,529 --> 01:06:57,622
Well, sir...
Well, we have started an industry.

985
01:06:57,798 --> 01:07:00,699
Matter of fact, we're sending
our first shipment out this week.

986
01:07:00,867 --> 01:07:03,427
- Now, we're making getas. We're...
- Wait a minute.

987
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,195
What in thunder is a geta?

988
01:07:05,405 --> 01:07:07,635
No, it isn't a geta, sir. It's plural. Getas.

989
01:07:07,808 --> 01:07:10,538
Getas, you know, you have to have two.

990
01:07:10,744 --> 01:07:12,905
- Are you breeding some other animal?
- «i»No, no.</i>

991
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,378
You see, you wear them on your feet.

992
01:07:15,549 --> 01:07:19,747
And they're very good for
the metatarsal muscles, colonel.

993
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,253
And now, I have another group.
They're out there making cricket cages.

994
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:27,849
Captain Fisby,
what kind of cages did you say?

995
01:07:28,028 --> 01:07:29,620
<i>Cricket cages, colonel.</i>

996
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,889
You know, the cricket.
The black bug that...

997
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:35,432
<i>It rubs its hind legs together.</i>

998
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,195
I think we can sell just thousands
of those cages.

999
01:07:38,371 --> 01:07:42,102
- Of course, we don't supply the cricket.
- Naturally, not.

1000
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:45,904
Captain Fisby,
have you taken your salt pills?

1001
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,513
Oh, yes, sir. Every day
at <i>chaya</i> in the pine grove.

1002
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,978
Have you been going out in the sun
without your hat?

1003
01:07:53,186 --> 01:07:56,383
You see, I wear a <i>kasa,</i> sir. It's a...

1004
01:07:56,556 --> 01:07:59,423
The wind blows through the straw.

1005
01:07:59,626 --> 01:08:02,117
<i>It kind of ventilates the brain.</i>

1006
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:06,789
I see. I see. That'll be all, captain.

1007
01:08:09,402 --> 01:08:11,529
- Gregovich.
- Yes, sir?

1008
01:08:11,705 --> 01:08:14,401
- Who's the psychiatrist over at Awasi?
- Captain McLean?

1009
01:08:14,574 --> 01:08:15,905
Yes. Get him on the phone.

1010
01:08:16,076 --> 01:08:19,011
My man at Tobiki has gone
completely off his rocker.

1011
01:08:25,952 --> 01:08:27,317
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1012
01:08:27,487 --> 01:08:29,148
Good morning.

1013
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:42,867
- Hello?
- Good morning.

1014
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,697
Good morning.

1015
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:16,727
Thank you. Thank you.

1016
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:29,274
Excuse me.

1017
01:09:29,449 --> 01:09:31,041
I'll see you. Bye.

1018
01:09:38,191 --> 01:09:39,556
Well, who are you?

1019
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:42,189
- You startled me.
- I'm Captain Fisby.

1020
01:09:42,362 --> 01:09:44,296
Can I do something for you?

1021
01:09:45,632 --> 01:09:49,932
- Oh, well, I'm Captain McLean.
- How do you do, captain?

1022
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,469
There was nobody here, so I came in.

1023
01:09:52,639 --> 01:09:55,699
Medical Corps. I see it. See?

1024
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:58,844
- What are you doing down here in Tobiki?
- I'm on leave.

1025
01:09:59,012 --> 01:10:00,912
Just thought I'd spend it down here...

1026
01:10:01,081 --> 01:10:04,915
...making some ethnological studies
of the natives.

1027
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:07,280
- If you have no objection.
- I don't have any.

1028
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:09,115
That's in your way. I'll take it.

1029
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,257
I was just examining that.

1030
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:13,858
- That's my cricket cage.
- Oh, you like crickets?

1031
01:10:14,027 --> 01:10:16,325
I haven't found one,
but I have the cage.

1032
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:18,726
Matter of fact, I've got two.
Would you like one?

1033
01:10:18,898 --> 01:10:21,696
Oh, no, no, no, thank you.
It's all right.

1034
01:10:21,868 --> 01:10:24,268
- What happened to your uniform?
- Oh, it's around.

1035
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:28,339
I find getas and a kimono much more
comfortable in this climate.

1036
01:10:28,508 --> 01:10:30,339
But isn't that a bathrobe?

1037
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:34,469
Well, it passes for a kimono.
Why don't you take your shoes off, captain?

1038
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:37,082
- Oh, no, thank you. Thank you, no.
- No?

1039
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:40,686
- I'll just keep them on.
- All right, fine. No objection, of course.

1040
01:10:40,854 --> 01:10:43,322
Sit down, sit down.
In my good chair, my good chair.

1041
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,118
- Thank you.
- Well...

1042
01:10:47,761 --> 01:10:49,353
No?

1043
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:02,106
May I ask,
what are you building down the road?

1044
01:11:03,543 --> 01:11:05,067
Oh, that's my <i>chaya.</i>

1045
01:11:05,245 --> 01:11:07,543
Gonna be something
to write home about, Mac.

1046
01:11:07,714 --> 01:11:10,012
- A <i>chaya?</i>
- See, if you have a geisha...

1047
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:13,516
...you gotta have a <i>chaya,</i> you know.

1048
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:15,154
How have you felt lately, Fisby?

1049
01:11:15,322 --> 01:11:17,813
Mac, I'll tell you something,
I've never felt better.

1050
01:11:17,991 --> 01:11:22,189
I feel reckless and happy
and carefree, and... Well...

1051
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,922
And it all happened the moment
I decided not to build...

1052
01:11:25,098 --> 01:11:27,123
...that pentagon-shaped schoolhouse.
- What?

1053
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,564
The good colonel, he ordered me...
He ordered me...

1054
01:11:29,736 --> 01:11:32,000
...to build a pentagon-shaped
schoolhouse here.

1055
01:11:32,172 --> 01:11:33,571
The natives wanted a teahouse.

1056
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,140
Would you believe
one of them gave me a geisha girl?

1057
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:40,006
So I decided that I was going
to give them what they want.

1058
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,580
I guess it sounds kind of crazy,
doesn't it?

1059
01:11:42,749 --> 01:11:46,014
Well, yes and no.

1060
01:11:46,186 --> 01:11:47,915
You know, these are wonderful people.

1061
01:11:48,088 --> 01:11:51,057
Wonderful people
with a... A strange sense of beauty.

1062
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,283
Hard-working when there's a purpose.

1063
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:54,757
You know what they're doing?

1064
01:11:54,928 --> 01:11:57,761
They're making cricket cages
and lacquerware and chopsticks...

1065
01:11:57,931 --> 01:11:59,398
...to sell as souvenirs.

1066
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:02,831
Don't let anybody ever, ever tell you
that these people are lazy.

1067
01:12:03,002 --> 01:12:07,336
- That's... Oh, I see.
- No, you don't. You don't.

1068
01:12:07,507 --> 01:12:09,338
- Oh, I see.
- No, you don't, no, no.

1069
01:12:09,509 --> 01:12:10,976
You will when you study them.

1070
01:12:11,144 --> 01:12:12,839
- You're building a teahouse.
- Yes.

1071
01:12:13,012 --> 01:12:15,173
And next, I'm gonna go out
and test that soil.

1072
01:12:15,348 --> 01:12:17,816
See if it won't grow something
besides sweet potatoes.

1073
01:12:17,984 --> 01:12:19,508
I'll send for some nitrate...

1074
01:12:19,686 --> 01:12:22,154
...some DDT and chemicals...
- Chemicals?

1075
01:12:22,322 --> 01:12:23,789
Yes.

1076
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,783
- You want to poison these people?
- What? No.

1077
01:12:27,961 --> 01:12:30,156
- Look, captain...
- What? What?

1078
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:31,957
I'm sorry.

1079
01:12:32,132 --> 01:12:35,067
You just touched on a subject
that's very close to my heart.

1080
01:12:35,235 --> 01:12:36,702
- Gardening.
- Yes?

1081
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:40,838
I've been on the point
of giving up my career...

1082
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:43,373
...just so I could set up
an experimental farm...

1083
01:12:43,543 --> 01:12:47,172
...somewhere where I could raise
vegetables organically, nature's way.

1084
01:12:47,347 --> 01:12:50,510
No poisons, no chemicals.

1085
01:12:50,683 --> 01:12:52,878
Let me tell you something, captain.

1086
01:12:53,052 --> 01:12:55,520
Chemicals will kill all your earthworms.

1087
01:12:55,688 --> 01:12:59,556
- And earthworms aerate your soil.
- They do?

1088
01:12:59,726 --> 01:13:01,990
Do you know that the earthworm
leaves castings...

1089
01:13:02,162 --> 01:13:04,426
...eight times its own weight every day?

1090
01:13:04,597 --> 01:13:05,825
That much?

1091
01:13:05,999 --> 01:13:07,830
Organic gar... It's the only thing.

1092
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:12,335
Compost. Manure. But no chemicals.

1093
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:14,837
- You know a lot about this, I can tell.
- Well...

1094
01:13:15,008 --> 01:13:16,066
- Well, I...
- You do.

1095
01:13:16,242 --> 01:13:19,439
I subscribed to all the farm journals
for years, you know.

1096
01:13:19,612 --> 01:13:23,104
Mac, listen to me,
I've got the... I've got the greatest idea.

1097
01:13:23,283 --> 01:13:27,151
While you're here, you could really do us
a big favor. A big service, mind you.

1098
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,220
You could sort of take over supervision.

1099
01:13:29,389 --> 01:13:33,519
Establish a kind of a... What do you call it?
An experimental station.

1100
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:36,561
Well...

1101
01:13:39,032 --> 01:13:42,331
- Oh, I haven't got the time.
- Take time, man. Take time.

1102
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:44,766
This is a chance
to put your theories into facts.

1103
01:13:44,938 --> 01:13:47,600
These are not theories.
These are proved facts.

1104
01:13:47,774 --> 01:13:50,265
Just tell us how to go about it.
That's all, Mac.

1105
01:13:50,443 --> 01:13:53,037
- Is your soil acid or alkaline?
- Oh, golly, I don't know.

1106
01:13:53,213 --> 01:13:56,011
- That's the first thing to find out.
- You're the man we need.

1107
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:59,015
- You're a genius.
- I'll want plenty of manure.

1108
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:03,315
- You'll get it.
- And I want to set this program up scientif...

1109
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:07,585
- What's the matter? What is it?
- I wish I had my books, my seed...

1110
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,285
Oh, I've got a stack
of seed catalogs that high.

1111
01:14:10,797 --> 01:14:12,697
- You have?
- Oh, man, and I...

1112
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:15,699
Well, let's sit down here. Sit down.
You know what you can do?

1113
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:18,770
You can write a list of those seeds,
catalogs, and books.

1114
01:14:18,938 --> 01:14:21,429
- And get airstrip to fly them in.
- Can you do that?

1115
01:14:21,608 --> 01:14:24,441
Can I do it? Sit down. Can I do it?
Of course, I can do it.

1116
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:27,580
- Make the list...
- Every spring I've made lists of seeds.

1117
01:14:27,747 --> 01:14:30,045
I never had any soil to put them in.

1118
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,013
Now I can actually germinate.

1119
01:14:32,185 --> 01:14:34,551
Make the list right now
and we'll get started.

1120
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:37,053
- Corn: golden bantam.
- Yes.

1121
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,622
- And Country Gentleman.
- Right.

1122
01:14:38,791 --> 01:14:40,122
- Hybrid.
- I got to check...

1123
01:14:40,293 --> 01:14:41,590
- Hybrid.
- Hybrid? Yes.

1124
01:14:41,761 --> 01:14:43,854
Gotta check with
my Department of Agriculture.

1125
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:45,520
I'll be back this afternoon...

1126
01:14:45,698 --> 01:14:48,531
...because you and I...
We'll have tea in the pine grove, Mac.

1127
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:51,932
We have tea in the pine grove
every afternoon when the sun goes down.

1128
01:14:52,105 --> 01:14:54,596
Cucumbers: Early Green Prolific.

1129
01:14:55,441 --> 01:14:57,375
And radishes.

1130
01:14:57,544 --> 01:14:59,535
Crimson giant.

1131
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:02,409
Crimson giant.

1132
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:07,412
- There's no answer, sir.
- What do you mean, no answer?

1133
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:11,648
Well, keep trying, I'm not the kind of a man
to take no answer for an answer.

1134
01:15:14,193 --> 01:15:16,661
Tomatoes: <i>Ponderosa Earlyiana.</i>

1135
01:15:16,829 --> 01:15:18,228
Watermelon:

1136
01:15:18,398 --> 01:15:21,299
All American Gold Medal.

1137
01:15:23,336 --> 01:15:25,099
Hello.

1138
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:28,297
- Who is this?
- «i»This is Captain McLean.</i>

1139
01:15:28,474 --> 01:15:30,772
This is Colonel Purdy.

1140
01:15:30,944 --> 01:15:34,141
- Can you talk?
- «i»Why not?</i>

1141
01:15:34,747 --> 01:15:37,978
I'm anxious to hear your report
on you-know-who.

1142
01:15:38,151 --> 01:15:40,051
<i>On who?</i>

1143
01:15:40,219 --> 01:15:42,710
Captain Fisby.
The man I sent you down to examine.

1144
01:15:45,391 --> 01:15:49,293
Well, colonel, looks like
I'll have to be down here several weeks.

1145
01:15:49,662 --> 01:15:50,890
Several weeks?

1146
01:15:51,064 --> 01:15:53,794
- «i»Well, Rome wasn't built in a day.</i>
- What?

1147
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:56,595
I said, Rome wasn't built in a day.

1148
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:58,134
<i>Well, you're the doctor.</i>

1149
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:00,329
Thank you,
but I expect to work miracles.

1150
01:16:00,907 --> 01:16:05,310
Splendid. Is there anything I can send?
Some old <i>Adventure</i> magazines or anything?

1151
01:16:05,712 --> 01:16:09,478
Say, colonel,
there are a couple of books I'd like.

1152
01:16:10,116 --> 01:16:12,346
I don't think you could get them.

1153
01:16:12,518 --> 01:16:13,883
<i>You name them.</i>

1154
01:16:14,053 --> 01:16:17,022
Well, one is the
<i>Principles of Pea Production...</i>

1155
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:23,827
<i>...and the other one,</i>
<i>the</i> Do's and Don'ts of Cabbage Culture.

1156
01:16:23,997 --> 01:16:25,259
<i>Oh, and, colonel...</i>

1157
01:16:25,898 --> 01:16:28,332
...think you could lay your hands
on a soil-test kit?

1158
01:16:29,035 --> 01:16:31,868
- A what?
- «i»A soil-test kit.</i>

1159
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:34,531
I wanna test the soil here,
see if it's sour.

1160
01:16:35,742 --> 01:16:37,073
Sour, did you say?

1161
01:16:37,243 --> 01:16:40,508
Well, yeah, if soil is sour,
your seeds won't germinate.

1162
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:47,846
And, oh, I'd love to lay my hands
on some bees.

1163
01:16:49,255 --> 01:16:50,984
Something's wrong
with the connection.

1164
01:16:51,157 --> 01:16:53,455
And I'm gonna have
to take some time out.

1165
01:16:53,626 --> 01:16:56,026
I gotta build up this soil,
you know, with manure.

1166
01:16:57,263 --> 01:16:59,697
- Did you say manure?
- «i»Yeah.</i>

1167
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:01,595
Nature's way.

1168
01:17:01,768 --> 01:17:05,568
Oh, I've lost faith in chemicals.
You kill all your worms.

1169
01:17:05,738 --> 01:17:07,729
Oh, let me tell you, colonel...

1170
01:17:07,907 --> 01:17:10,375
...when you kill a worm,
you're killing a friend.

1171
01:17:19,252 --> 01:17:20,549
Hello?

1172
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:23,584
- Gregovich.
- Yes, sir?

1173
01:17:23,756 --> 01:17:26,782
- Where's plan B?
- What did you want, sir?

1174
01:17:26,959 --> 01:17:30,258
I wanna see who I send
to analyze an analyst.

1175
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:37,059
That's hot water.

1176
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:39,500
- Hot water.
- Hot water.

1177
01:17:39,672 --> 01:17:41,697
That's it.

1178
01:17:46,946 --> 01:17:48,538
Hey. Hey.

1179
01:17:48,715 --> 01:17:50,444
Mac, Mac, come on, over here.

1180
01:17:50,616 --> 01:17:52,675
- Over here.
- I got a list of seeds here.

1181
01:17:52,852 --> 01:17:57,585
Put some more hot water in the pot
because we have a guest here.

1182
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:00,351
This is Lotus Blossom.

1183
01:18:00,526 --> 01:18:03,791
- How do you do?
- That's the geisha girl I told you about.

1184
01:18:04,864 --> 01:18:07,424
- She can't speak English.
- She doesn't need to.

1185
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,228
No? Oh, hey. The seeds. You sit...

1186
01:18:10,403 --> 01:18:12,803
- Sit down here, will you?
- Thank you, I'd like that.

1187
01:18:12,972 --> 01:18:16,169
Have some of this. You know something?
That's real jasmine tea.

1188
01:18:16,342 --> 01:18:17,604
- Really?
- Here's a pillow.

1189
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:19,972
- Thank you.
- Take off your shoes.

1190
01:18:22,248 --> 01:18:25,342
- Now, about those seeds...
- No.

1191
01:18:25,518 --> 01:18:28,078
Now we're gonna sit here
and watch the sun go down.

1192
01:18:28,254 --> 01:18:31,485
And we're gonna contemplate
the end of the day.

1193
01:19:37,293 --> 01:19:39,193
Look, captain, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1194
01:19:39,895 --> 01:19:42,887
Could you let me have
a couple of boys to help me in the fields?

1195
01:19:43,065 --> 01:19:45,863
Darn Japanese beetles
are eating up all my Chinese peas.

1196
01:19:46,035 --> 01:19:49,300
All right, I'll get Sakini to get
a couple boys to help you, all right?

1197
01:19:49,471 --> 01:19:51,962
- Oh, good, thanks.
- Alrighty. Now, Mac?

1198
01:19:52,141 --> 01:19:54,837
Sit down, Mac, and listen for a while.

1199
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:57,501
Lotus Blossom, will you sing again
for my friend Mac?

1200
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,706
- Thank you.
- Mac, but quiet, huh?

1201
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:02,282
All right.

1202
01:20:02,451 --> 01:20:04,544
Here we go.

1203
01:20:20,002 --> 01:20:21,697
Boss?

1204
01:20:21,871 --> 01:20:25,500
Very sorry to interrupt lovely song, boss,
but emergency out here.

1205
01:20:25,674 --> 01:20:27,073
What's the matter?

1206
01:20:27,243 --> 01:20:28,642
Everyone come back, boss.

1207
01:20:29,211 --> 01:20:32,237
All right. We better go see
how they made out with the souvenirs.

1208
01:20:33,883 --> 01:20:37,046
Yeah, put it up here so we can use this.

1209
01:20:37,686 --> 01:20:38,948
All right.

1210
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:42,090
All right? Come on, let's go.

1211
01:20:45,027 --> 01:20:47,552
What's this?
Now what's happened here?

1212
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,857
All the souvenirs come back, boss.

1213
01:20:50,032 --> 01:20:52,364
What do you mean?
You mean to say they didn't sell?

1214
01:20:52,534 --> 01:20:55,799
No, the soldiers who look
at the straw hats say:

1215
01:20:55,971 --> 01:20:57,939
"What you think we are? Hayseed?"

1216
01:20:58,107 --> 01:21:00,541
Mr. Oshira, look,
you were at Yatoda, what happened?

1217
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:02,370
The Navy always spends money.

1218
01:21:02,544 --> 01:21:04,739
Sailor said, "How much you want?"

1219
01:21:04,914 --> 01:21:07,712
- I said, "25 yen."
- That's good.

1220
01:21:07,883 --> 01:21:10,283
They say, "Oh, too much.

1221
01:21:10,452 --> 01:21:14,081
Can get better in five-and-ten-cent store.

1222
01:21:14,256 --> 01:21:16,986
- Give you one nickel."
- Didn't you tell them, Mr. Oshira...

1223
01:21:17,159 --> 01:21:19,787
...that every one of those cups
is handmade?

1224
01:21:19,962 --> 01:21:22,556
They say, not care.

1225
01:21:22,731 --> 01:21:25,928
They say at home, have big machine...

1226
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:29,730
...make ten cups every minute.

1227
01:21:30,205 --> 01:21:35,142
They say, "Take nickel or jump in lake."

1228
01:21:35,411 --> 01:21:36,639
How do you like that?

1229
01:21:36,812 --> 01:21:38,712
Boss, you gonna stop work
on the teahouse?

1230
01:21:38,881 --> 01:21:41,008
No, we're not going to stop work on...

1231
01:21:41,183 --> 01:21:44,209
They're gonna get that teahouse
if they don't get anything else.

1232
01:21:44,386 --> 01:21:48,015
By golly, you can tell them that I'm very
proud of that work that they've done.

1233
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:53,287
I'm so proud. And you can tell them too,
Sakini, that I'm very proud of them.

1234
01:21:53,462 --> 01:21:55,430
No, I am, I really am.

1235
01:21:55,597 --> 01:21:58,566
And I don't understand this.
No, no, no, I don't understand this.

1236
01:21:58,734 --> 01:21:59,962
I don't understand this.

1237
01:22:00,135 --> 01:22:04,401
Boss, they sure wish they could make some
money to spend in the teahouse, boss.

1238
01:22:04,573 --> 01:22:07,565
Because they not like
to go poor like beggar.

1239
01:22:07,743 --> 01:22:09,404
I know, I know.

1240
01:22:13,749 --> 01:22:17,742
See, he say, boss, it not your fault
no one buy souvenir.

1241
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:23,783
Well, they going home
to get drunk now, boss.

1242
01:22:23,959 --> 01:22:27,690
You know, I don't blame them, Sakini.
If I could find something to drink...

1243
01:22:27,863 --> 01:22:29,626
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, folks.

1244
01:22:29,798 --> 01:22:31,425
What are they gonna get drunk on?

1245
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,397
Oh, they got nothing but brandy, boss.

1246
01:22:33,569 --> 01:22:36,003
- Nothing but brandy?
- Nothing but brandy?

1247
01:22:36,171 --> 01:22:38,503
How are you gonna manage
to get brandy?

1248
01:22:38,674 --> 01:22:41,768
Oh, we make a very fine brandy, boss,
from sweet potatoes.

1249
01:22:41,944 --> 01:22:43,571
Been making for generations.

1250
01:22:43,746 --> 01:22:46,010
You make brandy yourself?

1251
01:22:46,181 --> 01:22:49,548
Yeah, sure, boss.
You want to taste some?

1252
01:22:52,855 --> 01:22:56,018
- Here you are, boss.
- Mac, Mac, my dear friend, Mac.

1253
01:22:56,191 --> 01:23:00,150
If this stuff is only halfway good, we're...
Oh, man, we're really in business.

1254
01:23:00,329 --> 01:23:02,388
This is one thing our men...
They'll buy this.

1255
01:23:02,564 --> 01:23:06,056
It may not be any good. You know,
some things even our troops won't drink.

1256
01:23:06,235 --> 01:23:07,862
- Well.
- Take a sip, boss.

1257
01:23:08,037 --> 01:23:10,164
I wanna smell it.

1258
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:15,374
- Obviously it has a kick.
- Yeah.

1259
01:23:15,544 --> 01:23:17,307
How old is this stuff, Sakini?

1260
01:23:19,948 --> 01:23:22,348
- Seven years?
- No, seven days, boss.

1261
01:23:22,518 --> 01:23:25,510
Oh, no, no, I mean, it wouldn't
smell like that in seven days.

1262
01:23:25,687 --> 01:23:27,086
They make it last week, boss.

1263
01:23:27,256 --> 01:23:29,724
Here, you try it, will you, Mac?
You're a medical man.

1264
01:23:29,892 --> 01:23:31,587
- You give it a try.
- What?

1265
01:23:33,929 --> 01:23:35,487
- You first.
- No, you're my guest.

1266
01:23:35,664 --> 01:23:37,859
I waive the honor.

1267
01:23:38,367 --> 01:23:40,767
You know, anybody ever die
or go blind from this?

1268
01:23:40,936 --> 01:23:43,404
We not dead. We not blind.

1269
01:23:43,572 --> 01:23:47,508
- Of course not. You see? Come on, Mac.
- They've worked up an immunity.

1270
01:23:47,676 --> 01:23:51,043
You see, I don't wanna kill one of
my own countrymen, you know?

1271
01:23:51,213 --> 01:23:54,239
There must be some way to test this,
isn't there, without me...?

1272
01:23:54,416 --> 01:23:55,883
There isn't, huh?

1273
01:23:56,051 --> 01:23:58,042
Well.

1274
01:24:01,657 --> 01:24:04,023
Sakini, get me Elsa Maxwell.

1275
01:24:04,193 --> 01:24:07,060
- One goat coming up, boss.
- Elsa Maxwell. That's who we need.

1276
01:24:07,229 --> 01:24:10,027
That's Higa Jiga's goat, you know?
We'll test it on her, see?

1277
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:12,861
Well, what are you gonna prove?
Goats have hardy stomachs.

1278
01:24:13,035 --> 01:24:15,663
No, look, if this brandy...

1279
01:24:15,838 --> 01:24:19,706
If this passes the goat test,
we're really in business, you know?

1280
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:23,811
You know why? No Marine will ever admit
that his stomach is weaker than a goat's.

1281
01:24:23,979 --> 01:24:26,607
Hey, boss, you gonna make
a guinea pig of goat?

1282
01:24:26,782 --> 01:24:29,683
Yeah, give me something to put it in.
Anything at all will do.

1283
01:24:29,852 --> 01:24:33,413
- Helmet?
- That's fine. That's fine. That's just fine.

1284
01:24:34,556 --> 01:24:37,650
- Oh, Elsa Maxwell very lucky goat, boss.
- Easy, easy.

1285
01:24:37,826 --> 01:24:39,088
Hold her head, Sakini.

1286
01:24:39,261 --> 01:24:42,628
All right, doctor,
proceed in the name of science.

1287
01:24:43,966 --> 01:24:46,093
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1288
01:24:46,268 --> 01:24:50,136
We're either gonna have an industry
or goat meat for dinner.

1289
01:24:51,173 --> 01:24:53,698
- What are you doing?
- Oh, not too much.

1290
01:24:56,912 --> 01:24:59,278
She likes that.

1291
01:24:59,448 --> 01:25:01,575
Hey. Hey.

1292
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,274
She all right? All right?

1293
01:25:03,452 --> 01:25:05,352
What do you think, doc?

1294
01:25:05,521 --> 01:25:08,854
It doesn't seem to affect her.
Reflexes okay.

1295
01:25:09,024 --> 01:25:12,460
Well, here goes.

1296
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:32,276
Hey.

1297
01:25:32,814 --> 01:25:34,042
Where you going, boss?

1298
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:38,414
I'm about to form the cooperative
brewing company of Tobiki.

1299
01:25:58,473 --> 01:26:00,270
Officers' Club at Awasi, please.

1300
01:26:00,442 --> 01:26:03,002
- We gonna make brandy, boss?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

1301
01:26:03,178 --> 01:26:05,942
Officers' Club at Awasi?
Captain Fisby speaking at Tobiki.

1302
01:26:06,114 --> 01:26:07,877
Yeah, oh, major? Major, this is Fisby.

1303
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:10,041
Yeah, you know,
when I was with your unit...

1304
01:26:10,219 --> 01:26:13,188
...we had a hard time
keeping a supply of liquor at the club?

1305
01:26:13,355 --> 01:26:17,189
You remember? Yeah, well, major,
I think I have stumbled on to something...

1306
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:19,156
...that might be of interest to you.

1307
01:26:19,528 --> 01:26:24,556
Yes, as you know, Tobiki
is the heart of the brandy industry.

1308
01:26:24,733 --> 01:26:27,258
<i>Brandy! Did you say brandy?</i>

1309
01:26:27,436 --> 01:26:28,994
Yes, brandy.

1310
01:26:29,171 --> 01:26:31,537
Look up the word sweet potato
in my dictionary.

1311
01:26:31,707 --> 01:26:35,575
See if there's a fancier word
for sweet potato.

1312
01:26:35,744 --> 01:26:38,110
Oh, I'm here, major, yes, here I am.

1313
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:42,273
Yeah, now, look, major, I might be able
to supply some of that brandy to you...

1314
01:26:42,451 --> 01:26:46,717
...that is, of course, if you're willing to pay
the price and you keep the source secret.

1315
01:26:46,888 --> 01:26:48,185
Yes.

1316
01:26:48,357 --> 01:26:50,552
Oh, they've been making
it here for generations.

1317
01:26:50,726 --> 01:26:54,856
Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, I'm sure
you've never tasted anything quite like it.

1318
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:56,429
Hold on a minute, major.

1319
01:26:56,598 --> 01:27:01,695
The Haitian name for sweet potato
is B-A-T-A-T-A, <i>batata.</i>

1320
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:07,866
Major, you've heard of
Seven Star Batata, haven't you?

1321
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:11,577
Oh, well, they make it here
in Tobiki. Yes.

1322
01:27:11,747 --> 01:27:13,772
Seven Star got him, I think.

1323
01:27:13,949 --> 01:27:17,043
Brandy eight- or ten-day-old, better.
Nine- or ten-day-old.

1324
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:22,953
Major, we also have Eight Star Batata,
and we have Ten Star.

1325
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:26,492
Of course, the Ten Star. Mind you,
that comes a bit more expensive. Yes?

1326
01:27:26,662 --> 01:27:29,130
That will run you...

1327
01:27:29,998 --> 01:27:33,627
...100-occupation yen a gallon.

1328
01:27:33,802 --> 01:27:35,099
Delivered.

1329
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:36,635
Yes.

1330
01:27:36,805 --> 01:27:39,467
What? How many?

1331
01:27:39,641 --> 01:27:41,541
Five gallons. Yes.

1332
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,735
Five gallons will be delivered
in one week.

1333
01:27:43,912 --> 01:27:48,008
It'll be delivered by
our Department of Agriculture.

1334
01:27:48,183 --> 01:27:51,516
Yeah, right. You're welcome, sir. Right.

1335
01:27:55,557 --> 01:27:58,355
All right. All right, let's...

1336
01:27:59,161 --> 01:28:00,389
Hello?

1337
01:28:00,562 --> 01:28:02,359
News kind of gets around fast, huh?

1338
01:28:02,531 --> 01:28:04,362
Hello?

1339
01:28:04,966 --> 01:28:09,300
GHQ.H... GHQ PX?

1340
01:28:09,471 --> 01:28:11,439
Yes. Yes.

1341
01:28:13,108 --> 01:28:14,905
- Thirty gallons?
- No.

1342
01:28:15,077 --> 01:28:16,738
COD?

1343
01:28:16,912 --> 01:28:18,345
Yes. Right.

1344
01:28:18,513 --> 01:28:19,741
It'll be there.

1345
01:28:19,915 --> 01:28:23,612
- Right. Thank you.
- Thirty gallons.

1346
01:28:26,188 --> 01:28:27,416
Let's go to work, huh?

1347
01:28:27,589 --> 01:28:30,820
I don't have to tell you.
Let's go to work.

1348
01:28:30,992 --> 01:28:32,857
Wait!

1349
01:28:33,028 --> 01:28:34,757
Wait.

1350
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:36,830
Wait.

1351
01:28:46,641 --> 01:28:49,303
I've got my cricket.

1352
01:29:07,863 --> 01:29:10,093
Put a label on that one.

1353
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:15,533
Seiko. Seiko, 15O more gallons
to the Naval Officers' Club, Big Koza.

1354
01:29:15,704 --> 01:29:18,002
COD. Take it away.

1355
01:29:18,173 --> 01:29:20,573
Yatoda!

1356
01:29:30,152 --> 01:29:32,177
Hey, Sakini, what are they doing here?

1357
01:29:33,522 --> 01:29:36,218
We're diverting water for a lotus pond.

1358
01:29:36,391 --> 01:29:38,052
Can't have a teahouse
without a pond.

1359
01:29:38,226 --> 01:29:39,716
Yeah, where's your goldfish?

1360
01:29:39,895 --> 01:29:43,228
You have a lotus pond,
you gotta have goldfish.

1361
01:29:48,437 --> 01:29:49,927
Hey, boss.

1362
01:29:50,105 --> 01:29:54,974
Everyone send me to bring you
to teahouse opening, boss.

1363
01:29:56,244 --> 01:29:57,836
Mac, look. Isn't that something?

1364
01:29:58,013 --> 01:29:59,947
This first-class, boss.

1365
01:30:00,415 --> 01:30:03,009
Hey, boy, that's really something, Sakini.

1366
01:30:03,185 --> 01:30:04,914
How about that?

1367
01:30:05,086 --> 01:30:06,678
- Well, come on, let's go.
- Lead on.

1368
01:30:06,855 --> 01:30:08,447
Okay.

1369
01:30:55,971 --> 01:30:58,496
Take shoes off, boss.

1370
01:31:13,522 --> 01:31:14,819
Thank you.

1371
01:31:14,990 --> 01:31:16,924
Good evening.

1372
01:31:18,126 --> 01:31:21,823
Boss, you sit here.
Lotus Blossom gonna dance in your honor.

1373
01:31:21,997 --> 01:31:24,557
Hey, Mac, you hear that?
She's gonna dance.

1374
01:31:24,733 --> 01:31:27,293
Come on. Sit down, Mac, you farmer.
This is in my honor.

1375
01:31:27,469 --> 01:31:32,031
How can I stall Purdy
so I can stay down here?

1376
01:31:32,207 --> 01:31:34,607
I'll have a relapse for you.

1377
01:35:38,419 --> 01:35:41,081
Chrysanthemum bud
in full bloom now, boss.

1378
01:35:41,256 --> 01:35:45,420
And now, happy birthday.

1379
01:35:45,593 --> 01:35:46,855
Very good.

1380
01:35:47,028 --> 01:35:49,292
Well, I'll be.

1381
01:35:50,565 --> 01:35:53,728
- How did you know?
- I gave you away.

1382
01:35:55,069 --> 01:35:59,301
Boss, now everyone like
to show appreciation, boss.

1383
01:36:03,645 --> 01:36:05,579
Happy birthday.

1384
01:36:05,747 --> 01:36:08,614
How very lovely you are.

1385
01:36:13,388 --> 01:36:15,720
And a happy, happy to you.

1386
01:36:17,659 --> 01:36:18,887
Yeah.

1387
01:36:30,638 --> 01:36:32,833
Oh, boss, you know what you do?

1388
01:36:33,107 --> 01:36:35,007
It called for flowers, sort of, you know?

1389
01:36:35,176 --> 01:36:37,144
That mean you give your heart to her.

1390
01:36:37,312 --> 01:36:40,145
Well, I do. We all do, huh?

1391
01:36:40,315 --> 01:36:42,010
Wasn't it beautiful, Mac?

1392
01:36:42,183 --> 01:36:45,311
She can dance
in my <i>cha ya</i> any day.

1393
01:36:51,526 --> 01:36:53,551
Pardon me, sir.

1394
01:36:56,664 --> 01:36:59,861
- Are you sure this is Tobiki village?
- According to the map, sir.

1395
01:37:00,034 --> 01:37:02,832
- The place seems deserted.
- There was a light over there.

1396
01:37:03,004 --> 01:37:04,995
Come on.

1397
01:37:08,076 --> 01:37:11,341
What? What is this?
Sakini, what do they want?

1398
01:37:11,512 --> 01:37:16,074
- They want you and doctor to sing song.
- Sing? No.

1399
01:37:16,251 --> 01:37:18,378
All right, come on, come on, Mac.

1400
01:37:18,553 --> 01:37:20,783
Come on, we're gonna sing something.

1401
01:37:20,955 --> 01:37:23,082
How about
"Deep in the Heart of Texas"?

1402
01:37:23,258 --> 01:37:25,488
Why not? There aren't any
Texans here are there?

1403
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:28,823
We're gonna have some fun now.
Sakini, look. You know, I want...

1404
01:37:28,997 --> 01:37:32,956
They're gonna help. When we clap and sing
"Deep in the Heart of Texas," they join.

1405
01:37:33,134 --> 01:37:36,103
Oh, I know that song.
Very nice, boss. We demonstrate.

1406
01:37:36,271 --> 01:37:38,296
- What is it?
- Stars at night.

1407
01:37:47,982 --> 01:37:50,212
- Deep in the heart of Texas.
- Deep in the heart...

1408
01:37:50,385 --> 01:37:54,151
Deep in the heart of Texas.

1409
01:37:54,322 --> 01:37:55,687
Then we clap four times.

1410
01:37:58,126 --> 01:38:00,060
Hey, we're all ready. Hey, we're ready.

1411
01:38:00,228 --> 01:38:03,220
All right. You ready on the left?
Ready on the right. Here we go.

1412
01:38:22,317 --> 01:38:23,614
Yes, sir.

1413
01:38:36,764 --> 01:38:38,356
Captain Fisby!

1414
01:38:43,204 --> 01:38:44,762
What in the name...?

1415
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,566
What?

1416
01:38:47,075 --> 01:38:49,543
I see you, Fisby.

1417
01:38:49,744 --> 01:38:51,871
Fisby, I see you.

1418
01:38:53,748 --> 01:38:56,444
Where are you?
Where are you? Where are you?

1419
01:38:56,617 --> 01:39:00,383
Fisby. Fisby.
Come out here. Come out of here.

1420
01:39:01,856 --> 01:39:03,221
Come out of here.

1421
01:39:07,862 --> 01:39:09,420
Sit down!

1422
01:39:09,597 --> 01:39:13,363
How many lectures have you delivered
to the village children on democratic theory?

1423
01:39:13,534 --> 01:39:16,230
- Well, now, let me see, sir.
- Four, five?

1424
01:39:16,404 --> 01:39:17,894
No, no, no, it wasn't that many.

1425
01:39:18,072 --> 01:39:19,300
- Three?
- No.

1426
01:39:19,474 --> 01:39:20,907
Two?

1427
01:39:21,075 --> 01:39:22,303
No, no.

1428
01:39:22,477 --> 01:39:25,310
You've only delivered one lecture?

1429
01:39:26,014 --> 01:39:27,641
None, sir.

1430
01:39:27,815 --> 01:39:30,249
Don't tell me you haven't delivered
a single lecture?

1431
01:39:30,418 --> 01:39:33,012
Yes, sir, I've not delivered no lecture.

1432
01:39:33,187 --> 01:39:34,518
Any lecture.

1433
01:39:34,689 --> 01:39:36,953
Have you organized a League
for Democratic Action?

1434
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:39,787
Yes, sir, I did that. I sure did.
I sure did that, sir.

1435
01:39:39,961 --> 01:39:42,953
How many lectures on democratic theory
did you give them?

1436
01:39:45,733 --> 01:39:47,997
- None, sir.
- You can't mean none.

1437
01:39:48,169 --> 01:39:51,627
- You must mean one or two.
- No, just none.

1438
01:39:51,806 --> 01:39:53,831
- I refuse to believe it.
- I'm very glad, sir.

1439
01:39:54,008 --> 01:39:56,806
- Sir, I must go.
- Where?

1440
01:39:56,978 --> 01:39:59,845
My seedlings are wilting.
I have to transplant them.

1441
01:40:00,014 --> 01:40:05,384
Captain, you'll pack your gear
and transplant yourself to your unit at once.

1442
01:40:05,553 --> 01:40:07,418
Yes, sir.

1443
01:40:08,122 --> 01:40:09,987
They'll die.

1444
01:40:10,591 --> 01:40:12,650
This is murder.

1445
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:19,823
Please, take care of my beans.

1446
01:40:22,403 --> 01:40:25,964
Now, is the schoolhouse finished?

1447
01:40:26,274 --> 01:40:27,536
No, sir.

1448
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:29,801
Why isn't it finished?

1449
01:40:30,078 --> 01:40:33,309
Well, we haven't started.

1450
01:40:33,481 --> 01:40:35,915
What did you do with the lumber I sent?

1451
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:38,618
We built a teahouse.

1452
01:40:39,087 --> 01:40:41,612
I don't suppose
you have any aspirin here?

1453
01:40:43,424 --> 01:40:45,051
I... No, I don't think so.

1454
01:40:45,226 --> 01:40:46,818
What in the name of occupation...

1455
01:40:46,994 --> 01:40:49,087
...do you mean by saying
you built a teahouse?

1456
01:40:49,263 --> 01:40:53,791
Lotus Blossom, she had to have a place
to teach the League geisha lessons, sir.

1457
01:40:53,968 --> 01:40:57,404
- Fisby!
- Yes? Yes, sir? What?

1458
01:41:00,875 --> 01:41:02,672
How could you sink
to such depths, man?

1459
01:41:02,844 --> 01:41:06,905
Well, I was only giving in to
what the majority wanted, colonel.

1460
01:41:07,115 --> 01:41:10,778
I don't doubt that statement, not at all.

1461
01:41:10,952 --> 01:41:16,891
It's a sad thing it took a war to convince me
that most of the human race is degenerate.

1462
01:41:17,191 --> 01:41:19,455
I thank my stars I come from a country...

1463
01:41:19,627 --> 01:41:22,118
...where the air is clean,
where the wind is fresh...

1464
01:41:22,296 --> 01:41:23,729
Oh, for heaven's sakes, sir.

1465
01:41:23,898 --> 01:41:26,867
Nothing goes on in a teahouse
that your mother couldn't watch.

1466
01:41:27,034 --> 01:41:30,060
You be careful how you use
my mother's name, Fisby!

1467
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:32,297
My mother, then, sir.

1468
01:41:32,473 --> 01:41:34,805
Sir, there's nothing immoral
about our teahouse.

1469
01:41:35,076 --> 01:41:38,671
Answer me this, what is bringing all that
occupation money to this village?

1470
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:45,549
- Well, answer it.
- No, no, no. It's nothing, nothing.

1471
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:48,211
- It might be for me. Answer it.
- It's not, you see...

1472
01:41:48,389 --> 01:41:51,756
- You see, this phone, it rings all day.
- Then I'll answer it.

1473
01:41:51,993 --> 01:41:53,756
Hello?

1474
01:41:55,329 --> 01:41:57,263
What do you want?

1475
01:41:57,932 --> 01:41:59,695
Who is this?

1476
01:42:00,401 --> 01:42:02,665
Commander Myers,
you must have a wrong connection.

1477
01:42:02,837 --> 01:42:05,237
This is not a brewery.

1478
01:42:06,507 --> 01:42:08,202
Yes.

1479
01:42:08,609 --> 01:42:10,236
Yes.

1480
01:42:11,412 --> 01:42:15,576
Yes. Oh, I see.

1481
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,014
I see.

1482
01:42:20,321 --> 01:42:21,652
I see.

1483
01:42:25,726 --> 01:42:27,091
Well...

1484
01:42:30,698 --> 01:42:32,962
There was nothing else
that we could make...

1485
01:42:33,134 --> 01:42:35,796
...that anybody would want to buy.

1486
01:42:37,338 --> 01:42:39,033
Brandy.

1487
01:42:40,308 --> 01:42:42,868
This ends my Army career.

1488
01:42:43,511 --> 01:42:47,140
And I promised Mrs. Purdy
I'd come out a general.

1489
01:42:48,449 --> 01:42:52,283
You've broken
a fine woman's heart, Fisby.

1490
01:42:53,321 --> 01:42:55,881
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

1491
01:42:56,057 --> 01:42:58,992
You've sullied the reputation
of your nation and all the tears...

1492
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:01,788
All right. Shall I kill myself?

1493
01:43:01,963 --> 01:43:04,193
Oh, don't minimize this.

1494
01:43:04,365 --> 01:43:07,493
You don't know the enemy's genius
for propaganda.

1495
01:43:07,902 --> 01:43:12,305
Well, what have you done with
all the money you've made so dishonestly?

1496
01:43:12,473 --> 01:43:14,668
I banked it in Seattle.

1497
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:18,606
That's despicable.

1498
01:43:18,846 --> 01:43:22,282
Making a personal fortune off the labor
of these ignorant people.

1499
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:25,942
I haven't touched a cent
of this money, colonel.

1500
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:29,612
Now, it's banked in the name
of the Tobiki Cooperative Company.

1501
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:33,920
See, everybody in the village,
they're all partners, don't you see?

1502
01:43:34,095 --> 01:43:35,562
You know, share and share alike.

1503
01:43:35,730 --> 01:43:37,994
That's communism!

1504
01:43:38,165 --> 01:43:39,860
It is?

1505
01:43:41,936 --> 01:43:44,837
I'll be lucky to get out
of this war a private.

1506
01:43:48,442 --> 01:43:49,909
- Captain Fisby...
- Yes, sir.

1507
01:43:50,077 --> 01:43:52,170
...you will consider yourself under arrest.

1508
01:43:52,346 --> 01:43:55,008
You'll proceed to HQ at once
to await court-martial.

1509
01:43:55,182 --> 01:43:58,948
I intend to wipe this stain
from our country's honor.

1510
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,088
- Gregovich!
- You called, sir?

1511
01:44:01,255 --> 01:44:03,086
I did.

1512
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:06,986
Yes, sir.

1513
01:44:08,562 --> 01:44:11,497
We have business to attend to here
before going to Awasi.

1514
01:44:11,666 --> 01:44:13,566
Yes, sir. I'm glad to hear it.

1515
01:44:13,734 --> 01:44:17,431
Captain, may I congratulate you
on what you've done for this village?

1516
01:44:17,605 --> 01:44:20,335
- It's a dream.
- Thank you, very much, sarg...

1517
01:44:20,508 --> 01:44:22,601
It's an alcoholic dream!

1518
01:44:22,777 --> 01:44:24,802
It's one vast distillery.

1519
01:44:24,979 --> 01:44:28,278
Take a detail and some axes
and smash every still in this village.

1520
01:44:28,449 --> 01:44:30,280
Destroy them?

1521
01:44:30,651 --> 01:44:32,346
Beyond repair.

1522
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:35,080
Take another detail
and rip down that teahouse.

1523
01:44:35,256 --> 01:44:38,089
- But, colonel.
- Pile the lumber beside the road.

1524
01:44:38,259 --> 01:44:40,989
That's an order. Do you understand?

1525
01:44:42,129 --> 01:44:43,721
Yes, sir.

1526
01:45:03,284 --> 01:45:04,512
I know.

1527
01:46:34,008 --> 01:46:36,568
Hot water.

1528
01:47:20,154 --> 01:47:21,746
Boss. Sorry, boss.

1529
01:47:21,922 --> 01:47:23,446
Jeep all loaded now.

1530
01:47:25,593 --> 01:47:27,618
I'll be along in a minute, Sakini.

1531
01:47:28,229 --> 01:47:30,220
You going to take
Lotus Blossom with you?

1532
01:47:31,732 --> 01:47:33,597
Sakini.

1533
01:47:42,977 --> 01:47:48,643
Ask her for me if there's anything
that I can do for her before I go.

1534
01:47:48,816 --> 01:47:50,477
Ask her.

1535
01:48:00,594 --> 01:48:02,528
What did she say, Sakini?

1536
01:48:02,696 --> 01:48:05,164
She say she want to marry you, boss.

1537
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,597
Now, why...?
Why would she want to marry me?

1538
01:48:11,305 --> 01:48:14,570
She say you nicest man
she ever seen, boss.

1539
01:48:15,009 --> 01:48:16,237
Oh, no, no, no.

1540
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:19,402
No. You tell her for me that I'm clumsy.

1541
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,707
I got...

1542
01:48:22,249 --> 01:48:25,275
I got a talent for destruction.

1543
01:48:25,452 --> 01:48:26,976
I'd only disillusion her...

1544
01:48:27,154 --> 01:48:30,681
...just the same way
I disillusioned all her people.

1545
01:48:38,232 --> 01:48:41,690
She say she like to go
to America, boss...

1546
01:48:41,869 --> 01:48:45,965
...where everyone happy, sit around
and sip tea while machine do work.

1547
01:48:46,373 --> 01:48:48,500
Tell her I'll never forget her.

1548
01:48:48,842 --> 01:48:51,367
I'll never forget this village...

1549
01:48:51,545 --> 01:48:54,946
...and on the other side of the world
in the autumn of my life...

1550
01:48:55,115 --> 01:48:58,016
...when an august moon
rises in the east...

1551
01:48:58,185 --> 01:49:00,949
...I'll remember what was beautiful...

1552
01:49:01,655 --> 01:49:05,022
...and what I was wise enough
to leave beautiful.

1553
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:33,283
She say, boss, she never forget you.

1554
01:49:33,687 --> 01:49:38,317
She like you to know that she gonna
make up a long song-story about you...

1555
01:49:38,492 --> 01:49:40,790
...to sing in the teahouse.

1556
01:49:41,195 --> 01:49:44,790
And she say maybe in 100 years
from now...

1557
01:49:44,965 --> 01:49:47,934
...you gonna be famous
all over Okinawa.

1558
01:49:50,371 --> 01:49:53,238
I'd like that. I'd like that.

1559
01:50:15,529 --> 01:50:18,760
Oh, he sure want to push
her wheelbarrow for her, boss.

1560
01:50:21,635 --> 01:50:25,969
She say okay, but not to think
that she's his property.

1561
01:50:31,545 --> 01:50:34,446
He very happy fellow, boss.

1562
01:50:55,502 --> 01:50:59,131
She going now, boss,
but you still her boss...

1563
01:50:59,306 --> 01:51:03,367
...so she say she not go
till you drop fan from face.

1564
01:51:55,829 --> 01:51:59,424
I've written a full report of this whole affair
to your commanding officer.

1565
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,591
I'm only glad you don't belong
to my outfit.

1566
01:52:01,769 --> 01:52:03,760
I won't tolerate rotten apples
in my barrel.

1567
01:52:05,739 --> 01:52:07,263
Hello.

1568
01:52:08,776 --> 01:52:10,300
Who?

1569
01:52:11,645 --> 01:52:13,169
What?

1570
01:52:14,181 --> 01:52:15,671
When?

1571
01:52:24,158 --> 01:52:26,991
Sit down, captain. Sit down. Sit down.

1572
01:52:27,895 --> 01:52:29,886
Make yourself comfortable.

1573
01:52:30,764 --> 01:52:32,891
Sit down. Give me your hat.

1574
01:52:33,066 --> 01:52:35,398
Have some of these <i>tsukemonos.</i>

1575
01:52:38,705 --> 01:52:41,902
Take your shoes off. I'll be right back.

1576
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:53,886
- Going now, boss?
- Yeah, I guess so, Sakini.

1577
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,624
Hey, boss, since you
not take Lotus Blossom...

1578
01:53:02,796 --> 01:53:05,230
...maybe you take me.

1579
01:53:05,866 --> 01:53:07,697
No, Sakini, no.

1580
01:53:07,868 --> 01:53:10,860
I work for you
for half price, boss.

1581
01:53:11,305 --> 01:53:15,173
Major McEvoy is coming down here
to take charge...

1582
01:53:16,343 --> 01:53:19,107
...and, well, he's going to
need your help, you know.

1583
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:22,476
You very hard man
to bargain with, boss.

1584
01:53:22,649 --> 01:53:25,641
Okay, you want,
I work just for rice ration.

1585
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:28,248
No.

1586
01:53:29,056 --> 01:53:31,422
You mean you gonna make me
work for nothing, boss?

1587
01:53:32,726 --> 01:53:36,492
I mean, yes, you're not going to
work for me at all, Sakini.

1588
01:53:36,663 --> 01:53:40,463
- No, you belong here.
- Okay, boss.

1589
01:53:45,372 --> 01:53:49,468
Boss, you know what I think gonna happen
when American leave Okinawa?

1590
01:53:49,643 --> 01:53:50,974
No, what?

1591
01:53:51,144 --> 01:53:53,135
I think we gonna have to use...

1592
01:53:53,313 --> 01:53:57,249
...a pentagon-shaped schoolhouse
for teahouse.

1593
01:54:02,756 --> 01:54:04,917
So long, Sakini.

1594
01:54:05,893 --> 01:54:07,588
You're a rare rascal.

1595
01:54:08,195 --> 01:54:10,322
So long, boss.

1596
01:54:11,465 --> 01:54:13,092
Say, you know, I'm gonna miss you.

1597
01:54:15,736 --> 01:54:18,705
- Hey, boss.
- Yes?

1598
01:54:19,239 --> 01:54:22,174
You not failure.

1599
01:54:26,413 --> 01:54:28,847
I'll tell you something, Sakini.

1600
01:54:29,082 --> 01:54:33,576
You know, I used to worry a lot
about not being a big success.

1601
01:54:33,954 --> 01:54:37,082
I think I felt an awful lot
like you people felt...

1602
01:54:37,257 --> 01:54:39,384
...always being conquered.

1603
01:54:39,793 --> 01:54:42,990
Well, you know,
now I'm not sure who's the conquered...

1604
01:54:44,131 --> 01:54:46,099
...and who's the conqueror.

1605
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:51,831
I've learned in Tobiki,
the wisdom of gracious acceptance.

1606
01:54:52,072 --> 01:54:54,836
See, I don't want to be a world leader.

1607
01:54:55,242 --> 01:54:58,609
I've made peace with myself
somewhere between my ambitions...

1608
01:54:58,779 --> 01:55:00,371
...and my limitations.

1609
01:55:01,114 --> 01:55:03,344
That's good, boss.

1610
01:55:05,452 --> 01:55:08,444
Well, it's a step backward
in the right direction.

1611
01:55:12,426 --> 01:55:13,825
Take care.

1612
01:55:14,361 --> 01:55:16,556
Socks up, boss.

1613
01:55:26,306 --> 01:55:27,933
Sakini! Sakini!

1614
01:55:28,442 --> 01:55:30,740
Sakini. Sakini.

1615
01:55:30,911 --> 01:55:32,139
Where's Captain Fisby?

1616
01:55:32,879 --> 01:55:34,312
Right over here, boss.
This way.

1617
01:55:34,481 --> 01:55:36,642
- Fisby.
- No, no, over here.

1618
01:55:36,817 --> 01:55:40,719
Fisby. Fisby.
Fisby, come back here at once.

1619
01:55:40,887 --> 01:55:42,548
I'm not in shape.
Too much paperwork.

1620
01:55:42,723 --> 01:55:44,850
- You called, sir?
- I've been looking for you.

1621
01:55:45,025 --> 01:55:48,188
You can't leave. You've got to stay here.
You've got to help me.

1622
01:55:48,362 --> 01:55:49,829
I don't understand, colonel.

1623
01:55:49,997 --> 01:55:52,329
We've got to pull this village
back together again.

1624
01:55:52,499 --> 01:55:54,524
The lid has blown off of everything.

1625
01:55:54,701 --> 01:55:56,931
- Where's Gregovich?
- Well, he... He's out there.

1626
01:55:57,104 --> 01:55:59,504
- They're breaking up the rest of the stills.
- Oh, no.

1627
01:55:59,673 --> 01:56:02,471
- Why? What's the matter?
- I radioed the report to Washington.

1628
01:56:02,642 --> 01:56:04,371
Some fool senator misunderstood.

1629
01:56:04,544 --> 01:56:07,672
He's using this village as an example
of American get-up-and-go...

1630
01:56:07,848 --> 01:56:10,510
...in the recovery program.
We're all over the newspapers.

1631
01:56:10,684 --> 01:56:13,209
- That's wonderful, colonel.
- It's not wonderful.

1632
01:56:13,387 --> 01:56:16,447
A congressional committee
is flying over here to study our methods.

1633
01:56:16,623 --> 01:56:19,820
They're bringing photographers
for a magazine spread. Tonight, Fisby.

1634
01:56:19,993 --> 01:56:22,461
- Oh, that's bad, that's bad.
- Gregovich!

1635
01:56:22,629 --> 01:56:25,393
Maybe there's a way we could stall them.
Maybe we could...

1636
01:56:25,565 --> 01:56:27,590
Maybe we could
quarantine the place.

1637
01:56:27,768 --> 01:56:31,329
You can't quarantine a congressman.
They've got immunity or something.

1638
01:56:31,571 --> 01:56:33,402
- Fisby?
- Yeah.

1639
01:56:33,573 --> 01:56:34,699
- Help me.
- Yes, sir.

1640
01:56:34,875 --> 01:56:37,139
I don't ask it for my sake.

1641
01:56:38,512 --> 01:56:40,912
I ask it for Mrs. Purdy.

1642
01:56:42,849 --> 01:56:45,147
I could be a brigadier yet.

1643
01:56:46,286 --> 01:56:47,685
Gregovich?

1644
01:56:57,264 --> 01:57:00,290
Gregovich! Gregovich.

1645
01:57:02,035 --> 01:57:03,764
- Gregovich.
- Did you call, sir?

1646
01:57:03,937 --> 01:57:05,962
Come here, come here, Gregovich.

1647
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:08,970
You haven't destroyed all the stills,
have you?

1648
01:57:09,142 --> 01:57:11,007
No. No, of course you haven't.

1649
01:57:11,178 --> 01:57:13,339
Oh, yes, I have.

1650
01:57:13,747 --> 01:57:16,307
I carried orders out to the letter.

1651
01:57:16,483 --> 01:57:19,941
Why can't somebody
disobey orders once in a while?

1652
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:23,146
What's happened to
the American spirit of rebellion?

1653
01:57:28,428 --> 01:57:31,192
- Sunstroke?
- Potato brandy, sir.

1654
01:57:33,033 --> 01:57:34,660
Sergeant, wake up.

1655
01:57:35,102 --> 01:57:36,592
Do you hear me? That's an order.

1656
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:39,898
- Colonel, I'm afraid he's passed out.
- It's desertion.

1657
01:57:40,073 --> 01:57:42,200
I need every man.
Gregovich, get to your feet.

1658
01:57:42,375 --> 01:57:45,003
Come on, sergeant.
Come on, sergeant.

1659
01:57:45,178 --> 01:57:46,372
Gregovich.

1660
01:57:46,546 --> 01:57:49,413
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Sorry, sir.

1661
01:57:49,583 --> 01:57:52,575
- Stop weaving.
- You're weaving, sir.

1662
01:57:52,752 --> 01:57:54,777
I'm standing perfectly still.

1663
01:57:54,955 --> 01:57:56,820
You smell like a brewery.

1664
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:59,390
Well, I fell in a vat.

1665
01:57:59,559 --> 01:58:01,993
- You got drunk?
- No, sir.

1666
01:58:02,162 --> 01:58:03,925
I fell in a vat.

1667
01:58:04,097 --> 01:58:08,261
Naturally, I had to open my mouth
to yell for help.

1668
01:58:08,535 --> 01:58:12,335
- Go to the office and sober up at once.
- Yes, sir.

1669
01:58:14,307 --> 01:58:17,105
Oh, sergeant. Sergeant.

1670
01:58:17,277 --> 01:58:18,835
- Fisby.
- Yes, sir?

1671
01:58:19,012 --> 01:58:21,947
- I think I'm going to need you. Stand by.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1672
01:58:24,818 --> 01:58:26,376
No.

1673
01:58:37,364 --> 01:58:40,197
I'm a sinking ship...

1674
01:58:41,434 --> 01:58:44,403
...scuttled by my own men.

1675
01:58:45,138 --> 01:58:46,435
I know.

1676
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:49,502
- Colonel Purdy.
- Don't bother me.

1677
01:58:49,676 --> 01:58:51,371
Stills not all destroyed.

1678
01:58:51,545 --> 01:58:53,604
I haven't got time.

1679
01:58:55,015 --> 01:58:56,539
What did you say?

1680
01:58:56,716 --> 01:58:58,308
We not born yesterday.

1681
01:58:58,485 --> 01:59:01,784
We get the sergeant drunk.
Give him water barrel to break.

1682
01:59:01,955 --> 01:59:03,513
Sakini...

1683
01:59:05,458 --> 01:59:06,948
...my friend.

1684
01:59:07,127 --> 01:59:09,220
You're not saying this
to make me feel better?

1685
01:59:09,396 --> 01:59:12,263
No. Stills as good as ever, boss.

1686
01:59:12,432 --> 01:59:14,297
Production not cease yet.

1687
01:59:14,467 --> 01:59:16,492
Sakini, you really are a rascal.

1688
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:19,605
No, he's really an American.

1689
01:59:19,773 --> 01:59:21,331
He's got get-up-and-go.

1690
01:59:21,508 --> 01:59:24,807
Sakini, if you could get
the people in the village to work together...

1691
01:59:24,978 --> 01:59:27,913
...how long do you think it'd take them
to rebuild the teahouse?

1692
01:59:28,081 --> 01:59:30,777
We not destroy, boss.
We just take away and hide.

1693
01:59:30,951 --> 01:59:32,782
Look, come here.

1694
01:59:37,424 --> 01:59:41,656
Now we going to show you
Okinawan get-up-and-go.

1695
02:00:35,482 --> 02:00:37,382
Be right back.

1696
02:01:28,568 --> 02:01:32,436
It's a land of mystery of the Orient.

1697
02:01:32,605 --> 02:01:35,267
It's... It's beautiful.

1698
02:01:35,442 --> 02:01:37,000
Simply beautiful.

1699
02:01:37,177 --> 02:01:38,508
There's only one thing wrong.

1700
02:01:38,678 --> 02:01:42,239
It needs a sign to tell people what it is.

1701
02:01:42,415 --> 02:01:47,011
And we ought to put another sign up over
there naming this Grace Purdy Avenue...

1702
02:01:47,187 --> 02:01:48,586
...and another sign...

1703
02:01:48,755 --> 02:01:51,349
Sir, how about a nice cup of tea?

1704
02:01:51,691 --> 02:01:54,592
- All right? Come on, colonel.
- All right.

1705
02:01:55,995 --> 02:01:59,726
- Twenty Star for the colonel, Sakini.
- Okay, boss.

1706
02:02:11,211 --> 02:02:13,441
Little story now concluded...

1707
02:02:13,613 --> 02:02:16,548
...but history of world unfinished.

1708
02:02:16,716 --> 02:02:21,619
Lovely ladies, kind gentlemen,
go home to ponder.

1709
02:02:21,788 --> 02:02:25,781
What was true at beginning
remains true.

1710
02:02:25,959 --> 02:02:30,555
Pain make man think,
thought make man wise...

1711
02:02:30,730 --> 02:02:33,824
...and wisdom make life endurable.

1712
02:02:34,901 --> 02:02:39,895
So may august moon
bring gentle sleep.

1713
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:42,430
Sayonara.
