1
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,933
<i>There was a demon
that lived in the air.</i>

2
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,221
<i>They said whoever
challenged him would die.</i>

3
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,723
<i>Their controls would freeze up.</i>

4
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,401
<i>Their planes would buffet wildly...</i>

5
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,396
<i>...and they would disintegrate.</i>

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,904
<i>The demon lived
at Mach 1 on the meter...</i>

7
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,748
<i>750 miles an hour...</i>

8
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,247
<i>...where the air could no longer
move out of the way.</i>

9
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:22,668
<i>He lived behind a barrier through
which they said no man could ever pass.</i>

10
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,093
<i>They called it the sound barrier.</i>

11
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,518
<i>Then they built a small plane...</i>

12
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,347
<i>...the X-1, to try and break
the sound barrier.</i>

13
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,603
<i>And men came to the high desert
of California to ride it.</i>

14
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,942
<i>They were called test pilots...</i>

15
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,238
<i>...and no one knew their names.</i>

16
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,048
<i>Okay, uh,
Whiskey Kilo 28, prepare to drop.</i>

17
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,808
<i>Roger, Control.
This is Whiskey Kilo 28...</i>

18
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,265
...lowering and launching now.

19
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,742
<i>Mach 0.92.</i>

20
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
<i>Point nine-three.</i>

21
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,836
<i>Point nine-four.</i>

22
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,414
<i>Hit a mild buffet there.</i>

23
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,839
<i>Mach 0.95.</i>

24
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,136
<i>Point nine-six.</i>

25
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,728
<i>Point nine-seven.</i>

26
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,859
<i>Point nine-eight.</i>

27
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,864
<i>Point nine-nine.</i>

28
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,201
<i>Whiskey Kilo 28, do you want
to declare an emergency?</i>

29
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,950
<i>Negative.
Whiskey Kilo 28 is not declar--</i>

30
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,181
No.

31
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,849
Go away.

32
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,906
No.

33
00:03:55,652 --> 00:04:01,705
<i>Lord, guard
and guide the men who ï¬‚y</i>

34
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,789
<i>Through the great spaces</i>

35
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,209
<i>In the sky</i>

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,050
<i>Be with them always</i>

37
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,348
<i>In the air</i>

38
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,262
<i>In darkening storms</i>

39
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:26,355
<i>Or sunlight fair</i>

40
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,518
<i>Oh, hear us</i>

41
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:34,533
<i>When we lift our prayer</i>

42
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:40,164
<i>For those in peril</i>

43
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:44,828
<i>In the air</i>

44
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:54,546
<i>Amen</i>

45
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,293
- Hey, Pancho?
- Hmm?

46
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,833
I was looking at the
pictures on your wall.

47
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,801
How come a fancy pilot...

48
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,134
...like Slick there doesn't
have his picture up there?

49
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,057
What do you have to do
to get your picture up there?

50
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,218
You have to die.

51
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,812
Well, Yeager, you old bastard.

52
00:07:55,642 --> 00:08:00,318
Don't just stand in the doorway
like some lonesome sheepherder.

53
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,653
Get your ass over here
and have a drink.

54
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,485
I got you something.

55
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,244
Mm.

56
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,909
Come here.

57
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,165
Look, Slick.

58
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,671
You could be the first.

59
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,004
The man who breaks the sound
barrier will be on top.

60
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,009
You'd be the one they remembered.

61
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,838
You're the best civilian pilot around.

62
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,348
Afternoon.

63
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,849
You get that helmet?

64
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,560
- Yeah.
- You're our first choice.

65
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,512
It might work.

66
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,519
I'll look like the Galloping Ghost.

67
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,901
Some people say the sound
barrier can't be broke.

68
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,237
An engineer will tell you
it's an absolute...

69
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,194
...like the firmness of the earth.

70
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,157
The sound barrier is a farm
you can buy in the sky.

71
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,697
The controls will freeze up.
You can't budge the stick.

72
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,458
Anybody tries to break it will auger in.

73
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,209
Well now, maybe it can't be broke.

74
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,711
Then again...

75
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,544
...maybe it can.

76
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,717
Maybe it can only be broke
for a specified sum.

77
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,889
How much?

78
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,437
One hundred and fifty thousand.

79
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,194
Come on, Slick, give us a break.

80
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,736
Non-negotiable, as usual.

81
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,825
What do we do now?

82
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,743
That guy in the corner.
Yeager is his name.

83
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,373
Some kind of a war hero.

84
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,503
Shot down five Germans in one day.

85
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,090
He's a natural-born
stick and rudder man.

86
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,422
As press liaison man
for the Air Force, I think--

87
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,929
Any problems with him?

88
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,131
- Only one.
- What's that?

89
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,058
Holding him back.

90
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,015
Major.

91
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,604
- Yeager.
- Sir.

92
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,362
We were just talking to, uh,
Slick about the sound barrier.

93
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,568
That right?

94
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,449
The X-1 is ready to have a go at it.

95
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,283
The X-1's got the answer
to go beyond Mach 1.

96
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,455
If there is any beyond.

97
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,126
So, what do you think?

98
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,623
Half these engineers
never been off the ground.

99
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,710
They might say the sound
barrier's a brick wall.

100
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,254
It'll rip your ears off
if you try to go through it.

101
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,641
I don't believe
the damn thing even exists.

102
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,390
A drink for Mr. Yeager.

103
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,138
No thanks, I got one.

104
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,182
You want to have a go at it?

105
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,147
I might.

106
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:48,323
But, uh, since, as you say, this sound
barrier doesn't really exist...

107
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,362
...how much--

108
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,617
How much you got?

109
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,746
Just joking. The Air Force
is paying me already. Right?

110
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,366
Why, sure, Yeager, but--

111
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,910
So when do we go?

112
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,837
Tomorrow morning?

113
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,588
I'll be there.

114
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,758
See you there.

115
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,343
How much are you paying him?

116
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,725
I think it's $283.

117
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,926
A week?

118
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,520
A month.

119
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,600
Well, that's not bad. Not bad.

120
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,780
First fellow to
break the sound barrier...

121
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,532
...gets a free steak
with all the trimmings.

122
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,863
I'll have mine medium rare, please.

123
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,628
Honey, you ever been caught
on the desert alone?

124
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,797
I never have.

125
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,218
I don't think I ever will.

126
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,724
Never met the man who
could catch me out there.

127
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,309
I'm half jackrabbit.

128
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,571
Forget it, flyboy.

129
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,775
You'd never catch me.

130
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,156
I believe I will.

131
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,330
Can't be done.

132
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,760
Could I ask you something?

133
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,936
Forget it, sweetie.

134
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,267
She's his wife.

135
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,325
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

136
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,865
Yeah. Come on. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

137
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,536
Come on, come on, come on. Yeah. Go on.

138
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,255
- Come on.
- Glennis! I'm gonna get you!

139
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,420
I'm gonna get you.

140
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,880
Come on back here!

141
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,591
Glennis!

142
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,098
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
Run, run, run. Go on.

143
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,806
Can't hide from me, girl!

144
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,601
Hey! Ha-ha-ha.

145
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,484
Come on, come on.

146
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:35,399
Come on, tsk, tsk. Hyah, hyah.
Come on, come on, come on. Go.

147
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,453
I'm gonna get you now, girl.

148
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,475
Oh. Oh.

149
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,766
Oh, no.

150
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,045
Morning, tiger.

151
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,634
What have you two been up to?

152
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,384
Where's Ridley?

153
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,560
Over there waiting on you.

154
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,477
Ridley.

155
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,726
Can I talk to you?

156
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,145
Morning.

157
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,239
I got a little problem.

158
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,912
A horse threw me last night
and I dinged up my goddamn ribs.

159
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,117
How bad you dent them?

160
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,249
I feel like I broke a couple
of the sons of bitches.

161
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,583
I won't be able to lean over
to shut the door. Got any ideas?

162
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,419
- Your left side okay?
- Yeah.

163
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:20,087
If these guys find out, they'll use
somebody else to fly this thing.

164
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,424
<i>- I'll try to fix you a handle.
- Thanks.</i>

165
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,555
Mr. Russell?

166
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,099
Can you help me out?
It's an emergency.

167
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,609
I need to borrow your broom handle.
Just hold this right here.

168
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,955
I think that'll work.

169
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,783
Thank you, sir.

170
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,139
Punch a hole in the sky.

171
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,968
I'll be right back.

172
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,310
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

173
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,895
How are you feeling?

174
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,484
Oh, just about right.

175
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,644
Mrs. Yeager.

176
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,383
There she is, all bridled,
saddled and ready to go.

177
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,882
You got any Beemans?

178
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,554
Yeah, I got a stick.

179
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,677
Loan me some.
I'll pay you back later.

180
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,056
Fair enough.

181
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,738
Hey, look.

182
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,071
Whang this in the handle
with your good arm.

183
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,736
Okay, thanks buddy.

184
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,612
Pre-drop checklist complete.

185
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,872
Ten, nine...

186
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,455
<i>...eight, seven, six...</i>

187
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:24,248
<i>...five, four, three, two...</i>

188
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,460
...one

189
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,749
Drop!

190
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,589
<i>There you go.</i>

191
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,145
<i>Put your spurs to her, Chuck.</i>

192
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,332
All right, here we go. Mach 0.91.

193
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,067
<i>Point nine-two.</i>

194
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,607
Point nine-three.

195
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,913
Hit a mild buffet there.

196
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,790
Just the usual instability.

197
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,499
<i>Ridley, make a note here,
would you...</i>

198
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,835
...if you got nothing better to do.
Elevator effectiveness regained.

199
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,263
Point nine-five.

200
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,601
Point nine-six.

201
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,399
More buffeting.

202
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,030
More commotion.

203
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,407
Getting wobbly, here.

204
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,155
Point nine-eight.

205
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,908
She's getting real active.

206
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,384
Point nine-nine.

207
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,980
What's that sound?

208
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,979
Oh, God.

209
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,322
He bought the farm.

210
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,323
We're back to square one.

211
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,989
Wait.

212
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,375
Ridley, make another note.

213
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,632
Must be something wrong
with the Mach meter.

214
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,048
Jumped plumb off the scale.

215
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,091
Gone screwy on me.

216
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,431
<i>You bust it, we'll fix it.</i>

217
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,516
<i>Personally, I think you're seeing things.</i>

218
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,895
Could be. I'm still going
upstairs like a bat out of hell.

219
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,742
We did it!

220
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:44,747
We finally broke the sound barrier.
We did it!

221
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,450
I want to place a long-distance
call to Los Angeles.

222
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,907
- Who are you calling?
- The press.

223
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,828
This is big news.
The sound barrier's been broken.

224
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,837
- No, sir. No press.
- What?

225
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,998
No word of this goes out.

226
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,420
This is big news.
We need coverage of this.

227
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,680
Sorry, no press.

228
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,886
Those are orders. National security.

229
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,767
But the war's over.

230
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,430
Look, pal, maybe they
don't want someone to know.

231
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,973
Who?

232
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,649
The Russians, maybe.

233
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,980
But they're our allies.

234
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:01,191
Well, anyway, someone figured it out
that way, and that's the way it is.

235
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,992
Chuck, you're our man!

236
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,487
You're the fastest man alive!

237
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,622
You'll ï¬‚y more planes for us.

238
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,325
We want you to fly all our planes!

239
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,499
What you been doing, hedgehopping?

240
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:59,382
Word will get out. Maybe not
to the press or the general public.

241
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,753
But soon, every fighterjock, rocket
ace, and rat-racer in the country...

242
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:08,766
...will be headed this way, wanting
to push the outside of the envelope...

243
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:12,262
...and get to the top of the pyramid.

244
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,661
<i>I got a rocket in my pocket
And a roll in my walk</i>

245
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,458
<i>So, baby, don't fuss me
With that north 40 talk</i>

246
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,965
Edwards Air Force Base.
This is the place to be.

247
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,387
They're going faster, farther
and higher than anywhere else.

248
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,633
Hey. Hey. Down.

249
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,094
I'll tell you something else too.

250
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:59,229
We'll climb right up that ladder
just like we did at Langley.

251
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,606
We?

252
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,445
You mean you.

253
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,106
Hon, we're a team!

254
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,116
I move up, you move up.
Right to the top of the pyramid.

255
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,285
Slow down, Gordo.

256
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,325
Come on now, you're scaring the girls.

257
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,129
You're scaring the girls. You are!

258
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,963
Come on, Trudy.
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

259
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,926
Huh?

260
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,137
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

261
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,356
You're looking at him, baby.

262
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,484
Come on, cheer up.

263
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,984
Hey, have I ever let you down?

264
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,854
Gordo.

265
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,146
God.

266
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,851
Oh, hear us

267
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:52,990
<i>When we lift our prayer</i>

268
00:28:53,690 --> 00:29:00,699
<i>For those in peril</i>

269
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,869
<i>In the air</i>

270
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,106
Hi there, pops.

271
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,461
Deke, that's 62 men in the last...

272
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,091
...36 weeks.

273
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,170
You know what that averages?

274
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,345
Is that Gus Grissom...

275
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,268
...from Langley Field?

276
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,852
What is an ace like you
doing in a place like this?

277
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,141
Well, if it ain't Hot Dog.

278
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:14,438
- Gordo Cooper, right?
- Yeah.

279
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,700
Gordo thinks he's one of those
hot-dog pilots you hear about.

280
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,865
You got a short memory.

281
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:25,574
I am not one of them hot-dog pilots.
I am the Hot Dog Man himself.

282
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:30,212
I guess you're too shy to tell this
guy howl used to wax your tail.

283
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,924
Wax my tail?

284
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,379
Yeah.

285
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,258
Hot Dog, you were just in my shadow.

286
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,881
That's where you'll always be.

287
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,592
What are you two rookies going to have?

288
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,601
Rookies?

289
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,223
Now hold on, sis.

290
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:54,191
You are looking at a whole
new ballgame here now.

291
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,857
Soon you'll even immortalize us...

292
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,867
...by putting our pictures
up there on your wall.

293
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,751
Did I say something wrong?

294
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,292
We got two categories
of pilots around here.

295
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,626
Your prime pilots
that get all the hot planes.

296
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:22,264
And your pudknockers who dream
about getting the hot planes.

297
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,719
Now what are you two
pudknockers going to have?

298
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,641
Scotch.

299
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,442
You know what happened!
The machine broke.

300
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,193
Not the machine, it's the man.

301
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:42,405
He was dead before he went up.
Don't talk about it here.

302
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,469
Good one. Now fire it in here.

303
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,393
Look at old Yeager.

304
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,681
On top of the pyramid
for five goddamn years.

305
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,560
Every time somebody goes faster,
he just goes up again.

306
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,189
He stays the fastest man alive.

307
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,824
You know...

308
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,034
...sometimes...

309
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,834
...all it takes is just the sound
of a truck starting.

310
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,541
I think:

311
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,797
"That's the crash truck."

312
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,513
Anyway, I'm really glad we could talk.

313
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,436
I thought only I had nightmares.

314
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,269
Yeah, me too.

315
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,728
Nobody ever wants to talk
about anything around here.

316
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,022
Everybody's always trying to...

317
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,235
..."maintain an even strain."

318
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:12,617
Well, you marry a fighter jock
and you marry the military.

319
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,244
I'll tell you one thing.

320
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,755
The military owes me for all this.

321
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,758
One day I expect the military
to make good.

322
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,929
Well, it sure ain't
your average dull life.

323
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,886
I went East for a reunion...

324
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,897
...and my friends talked about
their husbands' work.

325
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,398
How dog-eat-dog and cutthroat it was...

326
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,609
...on Madison Avenue, places like that.

327
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,573
Cutthroat?

328
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,077
I wondered how they would have felt...

329
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,626
...if, when their husband
went to make a deal...

330
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,415
...there was a one in four chance
he wouldn't come out of the meeting.

331
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,514
I'm going home to my folks
in San Diego.

332
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,935
What did Gordo say?

333
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,806
He "maintained an even strain."

334
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,653
Look at them.

335
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,612
You'd think they were
talking about sports.

336
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,954
BETTY
Men...

337
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,671
Sometimes they're just such assholes.

338
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,596
Sometimes they sure are
handy assholes, though.

339
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,643
Yeah, sometimes...

340
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,776
Sometimes.

341
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,152
Hey, honey.

342
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,653
You want a hot dog?

343
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,158
I'm leaving, Gordo.

344
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,832
You guys ready for hot dogs.
The buns ready.

345
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,999
Look at that.

346
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,173
Yeah, that's the D-558 Phase 2.

347
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:30,966
Scott Crossfield.

348
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,928
It sure as hell is. Jesus.

349
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,183
He scorched that one, didn't he?

350
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,893
He's pushing the
outside of the envelope.

351
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,438
He must be going for a record.

352
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,197
He's shooting
for Mach 2.

353
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:56,538
<i>On the 50th anniversary
of the Wright brothers' historic ï¬‚ight...</i>

354
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:01,376
<i>...another historic flight takes place,
as Scott Crossfield streaks...</i>

355
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,253
<i>...across the skies over
the California desen'.</i>

356
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,086
Mach 2.

357
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,216
<i>Almost 1500 miles per hour...</i>

358
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,715
<i>...and a new world's record.</i>

359
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,514
<i>It's a field day for the press.</i>

360
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,892
<i>Congratulations from
a previous record holder...</i>

361
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,897
<i>...as he shakes the hand of the
fastest man alive, Scott Crossfield.</i>

362
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:25,355
<i>And there's a comradeship of speed.</i>

363
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,488
To Scott Crossfield,
the fastest man alive.

364
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,459
Compliments
of Pancho's, Scotty.

365
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,305
The real test wasn't Mach 2.

366
00:36:55,463 --> 00:37:00,594
I guess that demon lives out
at about 2.3 on your Mach meter.

367
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,559
<i>But Mach 2 was the magic number.</i>

368
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:08,603
Like 60 homers, like batting .400,
like the four-minute mile.

369
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,021
The press likes a nice round number.

370
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,441
After that, they don't care,
until the next magic number.

371
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,328
You need more than speed records.
You need coverage.

372
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,954
Coverage?

373
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:23,708
You mean them root weevils
that crawl around popping off cameras?

374
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,040
Those root weevils write history.

375
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:30,082
Let them write the history,
and let the pilots fly the planes.

376
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,673
Pilots.

377
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,245
You know what makes
your rocket ships go up?

378
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,873
The aerodynamics would take
so long to explain to you that--

379
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,286
Funding.
That's what makes them go up.

380
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,454
I'll tell you something.

381
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,715
And you guys too.

382
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,717
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

383
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,221
Whoever gets the funding,
gets the technology.

384
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,632
Whoever gets the technology
stays on top.

385
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,222
Flyboy, let's dance.

386
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,852
I'll drink to that.

387
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:33,900
<i>When an old friend I happened to see</i>

388
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:40,244
<i>I introduced her to my loved one</i>

389
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:44,497
<i>And while they were dancin'</i>

390
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:50,208
<i>My friend stole my sweetheart from me</i>

391
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,211
<i>I remember the night</i>

392
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,597
He'll be going after
Crossfield soon, won't he?

393
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,682
No, he won't. He'll be going after
that demon that lives in the thin air.

394
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:14,190
<i>Yes, I lost my little darlin'</i>

395
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,528
<i>The night they were playing</i>

396
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,945
<i>The beautiful Tennessee waltz</i>

397
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,636
You got any Beemans?

398
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,431
Even before you hit Mach 2,
she'll be unforgiving on you.

399
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,608
Wring her out a little bit this time.

400
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,861
- You got any gum?
- Yeah, I got me a stick.

401
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,943
Loan me some.
I'll pay you back later.

402
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,691
- Fair enough.
- Thank you.

403
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,837
Okay, drop her.

404
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,298
All right, here we go again.

405
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,091
Three, two, one, drop.

406
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,687
Number 3 coming on.

407
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,698
Got seven seconds
on 150 right now.

408
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,973
<i>I've got you in sight.</i>

409
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,103
<i>Going out of sight...</i>

410
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,730
...now.

411
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,489
<i>Mach 1.</i>

412
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:34,992
Number 4.

413
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,416
Here goes Mach 2.

414
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,168
<i>Two-point-one.</i>

415
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,836
<i>Sorry, Scotty.</i>

416
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,631
<i>Hey, Chuck, you got her now, buddy.</i>

417
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,470
You can ease it back.

418
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,927
<i>Bring it on in.</i>

419
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,596
I'm pushing the envelope.

420
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,515
See where that demon lives.

421
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,203
Come in, Chuck.

422
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,712
<i>Say again. Do you read?</i>

423
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,798
<i>Damn! He's uncorked it.</i>

424
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,925
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

425
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,093
<i>Alert all ground crews.</i>

426
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,350
<i>Talk to me!</i>

427
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,817
<i>Come in!</i>

428
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,199
<i>Can you read me?</i>

429
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,459
I'm fighting bad here.

430
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,340
I'm down to 25,000 over Tehachapi.

431
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,228
I don't know if I can make it
back to base or not.

432
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,690
What happened?

433
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,647
Think I bust the canopy with my head.

434
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,478
<i>I'm getting okay now.</i>

435
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,033
We sure chased that old demon this time.

436
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,153
<i>That's as fast as a man can go.</i>

437
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,873
What's next, Ridley?

438
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,907
It's called Sputnik.

439
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,916
We know. Sit down.

440
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,916
And as I was saying...

441
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:33,217
...whoever controls
the high ground of space...

442
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,431
...will control the world.

443
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:40,436
The Roman Empire controlled
the world because it could build roads.

444
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,442
Later, the British Empire was
dominant because it had ships.

445
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,938
In the air stage, we were powerful
because we had the airplane.

446
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,951
Now the communists have established
a foothold in outer space.

447
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,955
Soon they'll have space platforms
to drop nuclear bombs on us...

448
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,783
...like rocks from a highway overpass.

449
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,953
How the hell did they get ahead of us?

450
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,746
We're ready.

451
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,674
Is there a loose plug there?

452
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,475
Here it is. I'll get it.

453
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,603
Senator Johnson's right.
This is Armageddon.

454
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,598
The decisive battle
between good and evil.

455
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,476
It's a struggle for survival.

456
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,944
- There you go.
- Thank you.

457
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:36,234
This footage was assembled from sources
operating under deep cover at, uh, great risk.

458
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,447
Very great.

459
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:41,865
We're fortunate this material
did not perish with a couple of men.

460
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,749
This is secret footage...

461
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:49,085
...of the Korabl rocket and the German
scientists they captured after the war.

462
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,500
Was it their German scientists
got them up first?

463
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,379
No. No it was not, senator.

464
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,217
Our Germans are better than theirs.

465
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,976
That's Titov on the right
and Gagarin on the left.

466
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,808
No, Titov's on the
left, Gagarin's on the right.

467
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,017
They bear a great
resemblance to each other.

468
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:13,988
If the Soviets ever do put a man
up there, it will be one of these two.

469
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,524
Most likely, the one on the left.

470
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,491
Isn't that their chief designer?

471
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,326
We know very little about him.

472
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,827
Let us see him again.

473
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,036
They've developed a program
of stupendous dimensions...

474
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,045
...and he is the genius behind it.

475
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,544
I, for one, do not
intend to go to sleep...

476
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,304
...by the light of a Communist moon.

477
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,097
Get that moron off of there!

478
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,896
Drapes, please.

479
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,025
We could have orbited
a satellite a year ago...

480
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,060
...if we had been allowed.

481
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:57,027
Now we must get something up there
quick and dirty, any way at all.

482
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,406
Well, what?

483
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,785
By combining our available rockets...

484
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:05,414
...the Redstone, the Atlas...
I agree that we could launch a pod.

485
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,246
A Dot?

486
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:08,500
A pod.

487
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,085
A capsule. Now, we will be
in full control of this pod.

488
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:18,219
It will go up like a cannonball,
and come down like a cannonball...

489
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,089
...splashing down in the ocean...

490
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,593
...with a parachute to spare
the life of the specimen inside.

491
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:26,970
Spaceman?

492
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,604
Specimen.

493
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:33,647
Well, what kind of "specimen"?

494
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,895
A tough one.

495
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,898
Responsive to orders.

496
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,617
I had in mind a "jimp."

497
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,621
Jimp? Well, what the hell is a jimp?

498
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,410
A chimp. A chimpanzee, senator.
An ape.

499
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:54,248
The first American in space
is not going to be a chimpanzee.

500
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,126
Who would you put into space,
Mr. President?

501
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:02,297
We have film of some people
we think are strong candidates.

502
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,636
We'd like to run it
and stimulate some thinking.

503
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,517
- May we?
- Okay.

504
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:10,930
These are people we felt would
be excellent in the splashdown.

505
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,981
We like the one on the right.

506
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,983
No, on the left.

507
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:21,195
These people are experienced
with machinery and have their own helmets.

508
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,692
Is that a factor?

509
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:27,159
As you'll see, they're quite
comfortable in conditions of flame.

510
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,201
Now, uh, this is, uh, personnel...

511
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:34,496
...who have very
well-developed equilibrium.

512
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,211
- Good middle ear.
- Also very nice people.

513
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,716
Very easy to work with.

514
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,502
With some work, they could be
very responsive to orders.

515
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:44,593
This is my first choice.
The man with the hood.

516
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:49,511
Since he works without eyesight,
his other senses are sharpened.

517
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,897
In space there'll be little need
for eyeballing at any rate.

518
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,558
The cannonball effect you mentioned...

519
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,353
We're thinking about...

520
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,275
...putting a couple into orbit.
Adds emotional stability.

521
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,495
This individual has many plus factors.

522
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,663
Ease with flames, comfort at heights...

523
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:13,702
...and, uh, agility in the splashdown.
Also, he is available on the 15th.

524
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,462
No. No, no.

525
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,714
I want test pilots.

526
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,425
No, you can't deal with them.

527
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,679
I'm sure we can do better
with another type of man...

528
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,464
...any other type of man.

529
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,726
A more manageable type.
it will only complicate things.

530
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,388
With a man we must guarantee
a safe return.

531
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:36,524
Mr. President, I think
you'd be wise to reconsider.

532
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:37,979
No, Lyndon.

533
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,229
Test pilots?
We'll be heading for some air bases.

534
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,821
Not just some air bases.
There's only one place to go.

535
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,364
I was there once before
and I hoped I'd never have to go back.

536
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:56,753
It's a god-forsaken spot on the roof
of the high desert in California.

537
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,756
A prehistoric throwback
of an airfield called Edwards.

538
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,714
They've got a weird mad-monk squadron.

539
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,504
They live in rat shacks,
terrible conditions.

540
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,265
Corrugated tin, bare bones, low rent.

541
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,886
This is where they hang out.

542
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,271
Pancho's Happy Bottom Riding Club.

543
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,898
It's called Happy Bottom Riding Club?

544
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,892
How'd it get a name like that?

545
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,186
Ask Pancho.

546
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,572
- Lock up?
- Yeah.

547
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,776
We're meeting the liaison officer.
They are expecting us.

548
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,411
Who's "they"?

549
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:31,825
The best--

550
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,327
Give me that.

551
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,413
The best test pilots in the world.

552
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,913
They got some kind of brotherhood.

553
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,253
They think they got the right stuff.

554
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,588
What stuff? Heroism, bravery?

555
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,591
There any snakes around here?

556
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,297
Yeah. In the bushes.

557
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:53,809
Heroism and bravery are part of it.
But, uh, there's more to it.

558
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:55,515
What do they say it means?

559
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,932
They don't say anything.
They don't talk about it.

560
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,309
They don't talk to outsiders?

561
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,945
To each other.
To outsiders they say even less.

562
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:10,489
Anyway, they're all here,
including the, uh, ace of aces himself.

563
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,369
Who's that?

564
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,946
Yeager.

565
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,823
Never heard of him.

566
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,882
These must be our gentlemen
from Washington...

567
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,430
...scouting for astronauts.

568
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,762
Welcome to Edwards.

569
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,680
Scouting for lab rabbits, more likely.

570
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,733
I didn't hear you.

571
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,146
I said "lab rabbits."

572
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,323
What's that mean?

573
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,485
It means you don't need
honest-to-God pilots.

574
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,865
You need a lab rabbit
to curl up in your capsule...

575
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,040
...with its heart beating...

576
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,122
...and wire up the kazoo.

577
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,747
I don't hold with it.

578
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,415
I don't either.

579
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:11,175
You want a pilot to be
a ballistic missile, then splash down.

580
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,472
Possibly get lost at sea.

581
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:16,510
There's some things you can't change.

582
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,895
Some peckerwood's
got to take the beast up.

583
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,682
And some peckerwood's
got to land it.

584
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,690
And that peckerwood
is called a pilot.

585
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,688
You're mighty right.

586
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,532
The boys smell panic in your program.

587
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,027
That's one thing they don't respond to.

588
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:39,032
Now maybe if we talk privately
to Yeager and some of the other boys--

589
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:43,665
Anybody goes up in the damn
thing's gonna be Spam in a can.

590
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,592
Yeager doesn't fit the profile.

591
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:51,798
Yeager doesn't fit?

592
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,056
He didn't go to college.
We're only taking college personnel.

593
00:52:56,423 --> 00:53:01,054
Forget about Walker and Crossfield
and the other civilian pilots too.

594
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:06,726
The security clearance just takes
too long with those people.

595
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:10,947
Besides, they seem
a little too independent.

596
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,577
You mean for this space race
you don't want our best pilots?

597
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,742
I didn't say that.

598
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,583
We want the best pilots
that we can get.

599
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,039
Hey.

600
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,087
Y'all want some whiskey?

601
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,082
No, thanks, Fred.
Just a little coffee.

602
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,551
- I'd like a Coca-Cola.
- Coke?

603
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,428
Mm-hm. In a clean glass.

604
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:39,092
There's an old saying:
â€œNever refuse a combat assignment."

605
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:45,974
Well, uh, there sure is a long line
of shit-hot rocket aces around here.

606
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,275
Hey, Hot Dog, what the hell's
â€œastronaut" mean anyway?

607
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,492
Star voyager.

608
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,124
Star voyager Gus Grissom.

609
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,504
I like the sound of that.

610
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:10,798
<i>Now your name is?</i>

611
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,125
<i>My name, JosÃ© Jimenez.</i>

612
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,680
Who are we gonna get
to take on the Russians?

613
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,639
Have you seen this Jose Jimenez?
He's a crack-up.

614
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,641
<i>I am the chief astronaut
of the United States interplan-</i>

615
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,649
<i>My name, JosÃ© Jimenez.</i>

616
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,529
<i>I see you have your
space equipment with you.</i>

617
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,657
<i>Is that the crash helmet?</i>

618
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,659
<i>Oh, I hope not-</i>

619
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,122
Get that guy off.

620
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,629
The country's already laughing at us.

621
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,089
<i>Eddie Hodges.</i>

622
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,671
This is the show I wanted you to see.

623
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,552
Who, that kid?

624
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,594
<i>And his partner...</i>

625
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:03,134
<i>...winner of five
Distinguished Flying Crosses...</i>

626
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,851
<i>...and holder of the coast-to-coast,
nonstop, supersonic ï¬‚ight record...</i>

627
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,057
<i>...from the U.S. Marine Corps...</i>

628
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,852
<i>-...Major John Glenn!
- That guy.</i>

629
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:14,569
Okay. Okay.

630
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,568
<i>Can you tell us what's that song?</i>

631
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,324
â€œStraighten Up and Fly Right."

632
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,708
<i>It's "Straighten Up and Fly Right."</i>

633
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,921
He's not dumb.

634
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:48,812
<i>Major, Eddie here has a little
problem with his girlfriend.</i>

635
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,601
<i>Did you ever have a problem
like that when you were 10?</i>

636
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,609
<i>Yes, I did, Bob.</i>

637
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,400
<i>I liked a girl in my class, but...</i>

638
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,403
<i>...other guys liked her
and she didn't pay attention.</i>

639
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,611
<i>But I kept after her, Eddie.</i>

640
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,409
<i>Did you finally get her to notice you?</i>

641
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:10,493
<i>Yes, I did. In fact, I finally
got her to marry me.</i>

642
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,749
They love the guy.

643
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,967
Mm-hm.

644
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,772
<i>Delta Charlie
9, you are clear to land...</i>

645
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,482
...at 180 degrees.

646
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,774
JosÃ© Jimenez on approach.

647
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,117
<i>Say again.</i>

648
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:47,120
My name, JosÃ© Jimenez.

649
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:52,035
<i>Yeah, Shepard, I forgot.
You are clear at 180 degrees.</i>

650
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,750
<i>Some boys here want to talk to you
about being an astronaut.</i>

651
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:59,543
They want to make me an astronaut?
Oh, I hope not.

652
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,308
Are you sure the Navy's got good pilots?

653
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,187
The Navy calls them aviators.
They say they're better than pilots.

654
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,039
I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.

655
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:39,127
- What?
- I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.

656
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,541
Just who we came to see.

657
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,718
Well, it's a pleasure.

658
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,883
You've heard about our project.

659
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,725
We're going up against the Russians.
It's got the highest--

660
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,229
Priority.

661
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,016
It's a hazardous...

662
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:00,520
...undertaking.
It's extremely hazardous.

663
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:06,529
It's so hazardous that if, uh,
you decide not to volunteer...

664
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,156
...it will not be held against you.

665
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,662
Sounds dangerous.

666
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,664
- It is. Very.
- It's very dangerous.

667
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,245
Count me in.

668
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,044
There's nothing to worry about.
Absolutely nothing.

669
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,083
Mm. Ugh.

670
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:31,346
Why are you doing this to me?

671
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,808
I'm afraid there's no simple
way to explain that to you.

672
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,898
It's nothing to worry about.

673
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,921
Thank you, Number 21.

674
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,795
Hmm?

675
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,599
Number 22, please.

676
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,431
You're gonna love it.

677
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,396
Please, sit right there.
Put your arm right up here.

678
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,609
Excuse me, you John Glenn?

679
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,281
Yes.

680
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,287
- Scott Carpenter.
- Hi.

681
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:37,450
I recognize you from those TV shows.
I like them.

682
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,451
I had a good time doing them.

683
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,830
I guess we're, um, both here
for the same reason.

684
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,293
Yeah.

685
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,709
You know what they've got planned?

686
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,173
- Uh, no. Let me check it out.
- Okay.

687
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,963
What have you got scheduled?

688
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:54,638
We're not really free
to reveal all the testing.

689
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:03,817
<i>I don't get this. Sending us
down here disguised as civilians.</i>

690
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,398
Come on, Gus, cut it out.
What the hell...?

691
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,360
This entire operation's
supposed to be hush-hush.

692
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:15,158
We got top secret orders to blend in
with the patients. So shut up.

693
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,582
Might be Russian agents here.

694
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:26,131
They don't look very
Russian to me, Gus.

695
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,877
All we got here is your
local gentry, and, uh...

696
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:34,385
...then you got Navy and
Marine pilots over here.

697
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,092
None of these guys is up
to Air Force standards.

698
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:42,389
I hear they got some 50-some guys
trying out for seven spots.

699
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,981
After they pick us three,
there's only gonna be four spots.

700
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:49,022
Sounds right to me. Where do we go next?

701
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:50,648
You go in that door.

702
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,653
Who are you?

703
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:07,126
My name, JosÃ© Jimenez.

704
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,134
You talking to us, buddy?

705
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,931
All Air Force pilots go in that door.

706
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,846
When they all go in...

707
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,928
...they all look the same.

708
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,644
But when they all come out...

709
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,275
...they all look different.

710
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,231
How's that?

711
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,944
Fellow, I said how's that?

712
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:39,496
When they all come out,
they all look scared.

713
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,461
<i>Buenos dias, yourself.</i>

714
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,972
Oh, there you are. Come this way.

715
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:05,105
That guy didn't fool me a bit.

716
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:06,769
That Mexican guy?

717
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:10,068
That guy's Navy all the way.
There's another swabbo.

718
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,651
I'll open the box a little
so you can see.

719
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,565
Don't put your fingers in there.

720
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,611
This thing will bite them off.
It's vicious.

721
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,829
Swabbo sense of humor.

722
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:30,122
Let's see what there is
to be scared about back here.

723
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:38,138
The ball must be maintained
in the position between these two lines.

724
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,007
You may begin now.

725
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,643
The record is 91 seconds.

726
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:13,976
Ha!

727
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:18,947
Ninety-three seconds.
Read it and weep.

728
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,683
Terrific, Scott. Darn good!

729
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,345
You were probably just
getting warmed up.

730
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:51,980
Next time I doubt I'll win.

731
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,184
I don't know about that.

732
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,148
It's Archie and Jughead.

733
01:06:55,678 --> 01:07:02,687
Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out!
Please. Please. Let me out.

734
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,696
Let me out. Let me out.

735
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,611
Let me out, please. Let me out.

736
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,334
Two-nine.

737
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:25,592
Gus, I got this
whole thing figured out.

738
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,714
The drill here--

739
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,800
Number three.

740
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:35,310
The drill here is to see who can
drill the brains out of Nurse Murch.

741
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,600
Nineteen.

742
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:42,818
You're nuts. She thinks we're
all just miserable pudknockers.

743
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:47,815
This is one fighterjock
who is not a miserable pudknocker.

744
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:51,986
She's a woman, susceptible
to charms like all of the rest.

745
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,949
Hi, doc.

746
01:07:58,116 --> 01:07:59,709
You want what in there?

747
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,369
Sperm.

748
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,455
What for?

749
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,966
Sperm motility factors.

750
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:14,592
Yeah, but, uh, nurse, uh,
how am I, uh, supposed to, uh...

751
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:20,348
The best results seem to be
obtained through fantasization...

752
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:24,734
...accompanied by masturbation,
followed by ejaculation.

753
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,562
Mm.

754
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:29,856
That sounds easy enough.

755
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,151
I'll tell you what.

756
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:38,160
If I get stuck, you mind coming in
and helping me out a little bit?

757
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:47,461
Please return it to the lab.

758
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,342
Um...

759
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,378
Yeah.

760
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:59,269
Oh, God.

761
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,405
Hey, cut out the humming in there.

762
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,720
Great.

763
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,060
Okay, knock it off in there.

764
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,735
Okay, Glenn, I know that's you.

765
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:57,077
Just knock it off, because I'm
trying to concentrate in here.

766
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,323
That was quick.

767
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,576
There's plenty more of that.

768
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,112
You want to see me again?

769
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,660
I'd like to meet your wife.

770
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,456
Uh, my wife?

771
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,666
You're married, aren't you?

772
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:53,299
Uh, yeah, sure, I'm married all right.

773
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,047
Happily?

774
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:59,005
Yeah. A real stable relationship too.

775
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,890
I'd like to meet your wife.

776
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:05,808
You'd like to meet my wife.

777
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,229
Tomorrow.

778
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,728
Tomorrow?

779
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,143
Um...

780
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,526
Tomorrow's no good.

781
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,278
Tomorrow.

782
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,704
<i>Good golly, Miss Molly</i>

783
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,749
I need you, Trudy.

784
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:37,169
I'm talking about a whole
new ball game.

785
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,337
Fresh start.

786
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,641
This astronaut thing is the best way
for us to move up that ladder.

787
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,727
If we play our cards right,
we go to the top.

788
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,482
We? You mean you.

789
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,227
I mean we.

790
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,063
We're a team.

791
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,947
Have I ever let you down?

792
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,329
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

793
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,621
Trudy.

794
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,877
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

795
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,877
Huh?

796
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,300
Huh?

797
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:24,090
You're looking at him.

798
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:37,646
I know. I know, I know.

799
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:56,131
You're all set. I told her you were
stable, well-adjusted, attentive.

800
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:59,088
- I lied.
- Attagirl.

801
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,547
What'd she say?

802
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:04,260
She laughed.
She knows you too well, Gordo.

803
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:09,602
Let's face it. Some women
just have a problem with men.

804
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,762
Yeah, I know.

805
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,987
<i>At secret
locations across America...</i>

806
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:23,241
<i>...56 of our greatest pilots
are at this moment...</i>

807
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,447
<i>...vying to be one of the first men...</i>

808
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,450
<i>...to go into space.
These are the most...</i>

809
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,201
<i>...up-to-date tests imaginable...</i>

810
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:33,789
<i>...and the most rigorous physical
testing ever done on humans.</i>

811
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:41,794
<i>They're being subjected to every stress
our doctors and engineers can invent.</i>

812
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:49,767
<i>These men are preparing themselves
for the ordeal of capsule life.</i>

813
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,224
<i>They will be guiding a new machine...</i>

814
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:54,809
<i>...through a hostile environment.</i>

815
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:58,651
<i>They will be faced with emergencies
no man can foresee.</i>

816
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:01,437
<i>Many are called,
but few will be chosen.</i>

817
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:07,694
<i>These are men who will have to
face any danger for their country.</i>

818
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:14,834
<i>No individual will have ever been
so adequately prepared for an event.</i>

819
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:19,706
<i>Each man knows that whoever
survives this competition...</i>

820
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:24,469
<i>...is destined to become
a legend in his own time.</i>

821
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,349
Here, hold this.

822
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,859
And hold this like this.

823
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:44,731
When the clamp is released,
the balloon inside you deï¬‚ates.

824
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,023
Where's the john?

825
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:50,362
Two floors up. Gonzales will take
you there, but wait here with him.

826
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,787
Gonzales.

827
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:58,244
How's it going, Gonzales?

828
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,250
- Gonzales?
- Hmm.

829
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,028
Faster!

830
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,457
Jesus.

831
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,506
Good day, commander.

832
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,963
You prick.

833
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:52,632
As you were.

834
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,811
Push the button.

835
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:00,143
Let's go. Just hold on to this.

836
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,354
Come on, come on, come on.

837
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:05,645
Jesus. Hurry up.

838
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,775
No, no, no.

839
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,597
You know, Mr. Shepard...

840
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,885
...me and my friends think your
JosÃ© Jimenez imitation...

841
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:42,353
...is A-okay. But what you're
doing with it is b-a-d.

842
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,984
You're right, you're absolutely right.

843
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:48,316
Open. Open.

844
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:55,828
Tell me something, Mr. Gonzales.

845
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:59,456
You ever have any
explosions doing this?

846
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,868
All the time. It's a mess.

847
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,661
Mm.

848
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,998
Tell me something else, Mr. Gonzales.

849
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:10,172
How am I doing?

850
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:14,176
I think you're gonna make it.
I think you're gonna be an astronaut.

851
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,151
Ladies and gentlemen...

852
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,323
After a long...

853
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:44,536
...and unprecedented
series of evaluations...

854
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:48,923
...which told our medical scientists...

855
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:54,838
...of their superb adaptability
to their upcoming flight...

856
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,549
...it is my pleasure
to introduce to you...

857
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,435
...seven Americans...

858
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,226
...gentlemen all.

859
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,559
Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom!

860
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,573
Leroy G. Cooper!

861
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,577
Donald K. Slayton!

862
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,198
John H. Glenn, Junior!

863
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,247
Malcom S. Carpenter!

864
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:29,956
Alan B. Shepard, Junior!

865
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:33,801
Walter M. Schirra, Junior!

866
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:39,261
America's Mercury astronauts!

867
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:54,605
Holy shit.

868
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:58,109
Smile, Gus. We're heroes.

869
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,488
Yeager ought to see this.

870
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:06,000
<i>Seven rookies being installed
as the hottest fliers...</i>

871
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,913
...and they haven't done a thing
but show up for a press conference.

872
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:22,551
<i>Following distribution of
the kits, those of you who have p.m. deadlines...</i>

873
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,810
<i>...better dash to your phones.</i>

874
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:28,514
<i>Now we'll have some questions
from the press, please.</i>

875
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:34,816
<i>I'd like to know
whether your wives and children...</i>

876
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,272
<i>...had anything to say.</i>

877
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,778
Mr. Slayton?

878
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:44,156
Ahem. Uh... Uh...

879
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:46,323
Mine think it's fine.

880
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:52,545
Thank you.
Mr. Schirra?

881
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,170
They're all for it.

882
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:14,311
I don't think any of us
could do something like this...

883
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:17,355
...if we didn't have pretty good
backing at home.

884
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:28,074
My wife's attitude has been the same
as it's been all through my flying.

885
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:32,203
If it's what I want to do,
she's behind it.

886
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:35,206
And, by golly,
my kids are too, 100 percent.

887
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,724
I don't believe this.

888
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,594
But look at them out there.
They're eating it up.

889
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:49,808
Uh-huh.

890
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:55,726
I believe you are placed on earth...

891
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,230
...more or less
with a fifty-fifty proposition.

892
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,116
This is what I still believe.

893
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,746
We're placed here with certain
talents and capabilities...

894
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:11,621
...and it's up to us
to use those talents as best we can.

895
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:16,918
And if we use our talents properly...

896
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,798
...I think there is a power
greater than us that will place...

897
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,634
<i>...the opportunity in our way.</i>

898
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:33,640
When I think of
Orville and Wilbur Wright...

899
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:36,275
...standing on a hill at Kitty Hawk...

900
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:41,151
...tossing a coin to see which one
would take the first airplane flight...

901
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:45,197
...and then I think of us today...

902
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,783
...I thank God I live in a country...

903
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:55,752
...where the best and finest
in a man can be brought out.

904
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,964
I mean it. Thank you.

905
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:12,303
I'd like to, uh, second some of the
things Mr. Glenn has said here.

906
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:18,317
I think that we are all very,
very fortunate...

907
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:21,813
...that we have been, uh,
should we say, "blessed"...

908
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:24,815
...with the talents
for something like this.

909
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:29,445
And I think that we would be
most remiss in our duty indeed...

910
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:33,661
<i>...if we did not volunteer
for something as important as this is...</i>

911
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:35,201
...to our country...

912
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:38,337
...and to the world
in general right now.

913
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,342
One of our Air Force boys.

914
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,005
Don't you agree, Deke?

915
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:51,341
I absolutely agree with Gordo.

916
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,220
But we're not saying anything new.

917
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,230
We're just saying the same things...

918
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:01,735
...that need to be said again
and again with fierce conviction.

919
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:12,656
Can you tell us if any of you
go to church regularly?

920
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,698
Yes.

921
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:20,122
As far as church goes,
I attend regularly.

922
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:26,343
Uh, which one of you will be
the first into space?

923
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,275
The best will be first.

924
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,586
Share it, brother.

925
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,302
Fucking A, Bubba.

926
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,925
<i>This is for America's Life magazine.</i>

927
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:16,761
Ah, that's it. That's it.

928
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:18,770
Mrs. Grissom. Mrs. Grissom.

929
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,398
Good, good, good.

930
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:26,313
These are the greatest pilots
in America.

931
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:29,106
How much do they make?

932
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:32,109
Seven, $8000 a year?

933
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,161
Hmm.

934
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:35,821
With this one deal...

935
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:40,960
...I'm giving them $500,000
split seven ways over three years.

936
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,332
How's that sound?

937
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:49,882
Now I want them all to meet my people
who will write their true stories.

938
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,468
<i>These stories will appear
in Life under their own by-lines.</i>

939
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,219
For example...

940
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:58,135
"...by Betty Grissom..."

941
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,478
...or, "by...

942
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,639
"...Virgil I. Grissom."

943
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,392
Gus.

944
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:10,105
- What was that?
- Gus.

945
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,367
Nobody calls me by that other name.

946
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:19,749
Gus? An astronaut named Gus?

947
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:24,999
- What's your middle name?
- lvan.

948
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:26,876
Ivan.

949
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,752
Maybe...

950
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:34,471
..."Gus" isn't so bad.

951
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,673
Might be something there.

952
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:42,559
All right, you can be Gus.

953
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:48,857
I bet for all that money
they could call you Virgil.

954
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:51,488
They sure could me.

955
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:59,405
Well, what's with her?

956
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:02,199
She seems snobby.

957
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,206
I don't get it.

958
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:08,539
I get it. She's Mrs. Clean Marine.

959
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,553
I'm going to the Cape tomorrow.

960
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:29,567
I wish to heck it wasn't
off-limits to wives.

961
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,569
There's so much work to do, anyway.
More tests...

962
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,574
...training...

963
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,068
"studying-

964
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:48,750
What about after?

965
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:55,252
After hours I'll run.
I'm going to get up to five miles a day.

966
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:58,464
There's a beautiful, long beach there.

967
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:00,598
It's called Cocoa Beach.

968
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,594
You can run forever.

969
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:09,316
Scott Carpenter will run with me.
He's a good guy.

970
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,475
Hmm.

971
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,565
He's real philosophical.

972
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,616
What about...?

973
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:24,991
The others want to get the job done
and keep the Mickey Mouse to a minimum.

974
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:29,494
They're good men.

975
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:32,498
Good men.

976
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:36,297
They'll give 100 percent
when the time comes.

977
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,305
Guess they think I'm kind of a...

978
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:48,013
...gung-ho type-

979
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,649
Eddie Attaboy.

980
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:54,816
Harry Hairshirt.

981
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,025
What, you agree?

982
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,287
You agree?

983
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:05,743
My own wife.

984
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:09,417
Do you think I'm a Dudley Doright?

985
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:14,006
Do you? Yeah?

986
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:15,541
That's me, I guess.

987
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,335
A lonely beacon of restraint...

988
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:22,047
and self-sacrifice
in a squall of car-crazies.

989
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:39,690
It's important to America
to get a man up there first.

990
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:46,618
I plan to be the first man
to ride the rocket.

991
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,818
<i>Nine, eight...</i>

992
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:23,656
<i>...seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one, ignition.</i>

993
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:46,693
Four, three, two, one, zero.

994
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,505
<i>What is the most
important thing in rocket travel?</i>

995
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:44,587
<i>To me the most important thing...</i>

996
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,677
<i>...is the blast-off.</i>

997
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:50,214
<i>I always take a blast before I take off.</i>

998
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,266
<i>Otherwise I wouldn't go near it.</i>

999
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,188
He loves Ed Sullivan.

1000
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:06,321
Ed Sullivan? Oh, yeah. Heh.

1001
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:16,578
<i>I only have eyes</i>

1002
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:22,539
<i>For you</i>

1003
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:34,433
<i>You are here
And so am I</i>

1004
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:37,310
Four down, three to go.

1005
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:47,989
<i>But they all disappear</i>

1006
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:51,991
<i>From view</i>

1007
01:32:56,821 --> 01:33:03,249
<i>And I only have eyes</i>

1008
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:11,421
<i>For you</i>

1009
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:19,102
I don't want this program
put in a bad light.

1010
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:25,689
We have the opportunity of a lifetime
and I won't stand by and let...

1011
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,444
...other people compromise
the whole darned thing!

1012
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:31,482
This could lead to
something very unfortunate.

1013
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:33,316
What's ticking you off?

1014
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:35,986
I'm talking about playing around.

1015
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:38,496
I'm talking about the young girls...

1016
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,123
...the cookies.

1017
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:43,785
About keeping our pants zipped
and our wicks dry.

1018
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:46,421
Mr. Glenn, you are way out of line.

1019
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:49,840
I advise you
not to try to foist your moral views...

1020
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:52,047
...on anyone else in this group.

1021
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:54,838
Each man here has
volunteered to do a job...

1022
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:57,177
...devoting long hours of training...

1023
01:33:57,507 --> 01:34:00,727
...and doing things above and beyond
the call of duty...

1024
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,307
...such as morale tours--

1025
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,189
Such as bringing girls up to your room?

1026
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,643
And forgoing any orderly family life.

1027
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,900
As long as a man uses good sense...

1028
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:13,906
...what he does with his wick
is his own business!

1029
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,781
I'm from Life magazine.
I'm not with these people.

1030
01:34:17,944 --> 01:34:20,663
You can't go in.
They're discussing science.

1031
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:26,915
John's right.

1032
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:28,671
We're public figures.

1033
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:31,549
Whether we deserve it or not,
people look up to us.

1034
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:34,177
We have a tremendous responsibility.

1035
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,679
You can't tell a pilot what to do
when not flying.

1036
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,437
Wait a minute. You got it all wrong.

1037
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:48,476
<i>The issue here ain't pussy.
The issue here is monkey.</i>

1038
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:53,447
- What?
- Us. We are the monkey.

1039
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:57,658
Gus is saying that
we're missing the point.

1040
01:34:57,817 --> 01:34:59,285
Gus is saying...

1041
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:02,368
...we heard they want
to send a monkey up first.

1042
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:05,625
They're sending a monkey up
to do a man's work.

1043
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,581
Gus is saying...

1044
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:11,669
...they're trying to send a man up
to do a monkey's work.

1045
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:15,335
Us. A bunch of
college-trained chimpanzees.

1046
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,003
Gus is saying...

1047
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:21,016
...we've got to change things.
He's saying that we are pilots.

1048
01:35:21,174 --> 01:35:24,974
We know more about what we need
to fly than anybody else.

1049
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:27,855
What we have to do is
alter the experiment.

1050
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:31,985
It comes down to who is going
to control this thing from here on.

1051
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:36,990
Gus is saying
we've got to stick together.

1052
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,468
These tests were designed...

1053
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:49,683
...to decondition, to desensitize...

1054
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:51,689
...to adapt out fears.

1055
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:56,854
Since we have developed
a fully automated vehicle...

1056
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:59,655
...all we seek from the occupants...

1057
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:02,363
...of the capsule is data.

1058
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:03,989
The so-called...

1059
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:08,573
...astronaut would merely be
a redundant component.

1060
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:16,422
The chimps are capable of many
of the same tasks as men.

1061
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:19,209
And they are much more cooperative.

1062
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:27,634
They are being put through every phase
of the astronaut training.

1063
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,020
For us, the question still remains:

1064
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:33,307
Which one will be first?

1065
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:35,225
The man or...

1066
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:36,483
...the monkey?

1067
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:38,940
We shall see.

1068
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:12,645
Take it easy with that.

1069
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:21,984
Uh, where are you putting the window?

1070
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:24,490
Window? There is no window.

1071
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:26,151
No window?

1072
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:28,285
What about the hatch?

1073
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:30,454
- The hatch?
- Yeah, the hatch.

1074
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:33,287
We need a hatch with explosive bolts
we can open ourselves.

1075
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:38,171
There's something you don't understand.
This is the final form of the capsule.

1076
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:39,672
No hatch.

1077
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:43,051
What if the automatic controls went out?

1078
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:46,258
With backups, checks,
this would not happen.

1079
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,970
I said, what would happen if it did?

1080
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:52,928
- The pilot would have to fly it back.
- This is the way it is.

1081
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:57,315
I wonder how the press
will feel about this.

1082
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:01,398
The press? What does the press
have to say about this?

1083
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:06,067
Do you know what makes
this bird go up?

1084
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:08,451
Funding makes this bird go up.

1085
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:12,997
That's right.
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

1086
01:39:13,489 --> 01:39:15,912
And, uh, the press over there...

1087
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,501
They all want to see Buck Rogers.

1088
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:28,714
And that's us. Buck Rogers.

1089
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:32,934
Those fellows over there
have been making us out...

1090
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:36,687
...as the seven finest and bravest
pilots in all America.

1091
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:39,725
If the story would
come out in the press...

1092
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:43,228
...that we can't fly as pilots...

1093
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:44,771
We want a window.

1094
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:50,243
There could, maybe, be...

1095
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:53,530
...in future capsules a window...

1096
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:56,328
...here.

1097
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:59,494
No, that's where the hatch
with explosive bolts goes.

1098
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,913
The hatch with the explosive--

1099
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:08,591
There could be a hatch
with explosive bolts on the capsule.

1100
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:11,051
That is a spacecraft, sir.

1101
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:14,384
We do not refer to it as a capsule.

1102
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:17,887
Spacecraft.

1103
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:25,062
A hatch with explosive
bolts on the spacecraft.

1104
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:31,652
And there will be pitch and yaw
thrusters to enable the occupant--

1105
01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:33,535
The pilot.

1106
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,288
Astronaut-pilot.

1107
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:40,706
The astronaut...

1108
01:40:42,078 --> 01:40:43,125
...pilot...

1109
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:45,839
...to have some--

1110
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:48,088
To have...

1111
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:53,965
...control...

1112
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:57,310
...of the re-entry procedures.

1113
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:03,603
We appreciate it.

1114
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:07,858
You wouldn't mind if we had the press
to take a few photos of us, would you?

1115
01:41:09,105 --> 01:41:10,527
Good idea, John.

1116
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:14,986
Look, Glenn's waving us in.
What's your problem, huh?

1117
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:44,520
Which one of you is
going to be the first one...

1118
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:46,980
...to be launched into space?

1119
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:49,479
Smile. Okay, that's it.

1120
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:23,888
Here he is.

1121
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:26,937
Captain Ham.

1122
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:31,608
Grinning like a possum
eating a sweet potato.

1123
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,696
Does he look like he'd put
doo-doo in the capsule?

1124
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:40,409
Ham in a can.

1125
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:14,397
<i>Off we go in a wild blue yonder</i>

1126
01:43:14,563 --> 01:43:17,191
<i>Climbing high into the sun</i>

1127
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:22,413
<i>Here they come
Zooming to meet our thunder</i>

1128
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:26,121
<i>At 'em boys
Give 'er the gun</i>

1129
01:44:11,871 --> 01:44:13,498
They've got a man up there.
It's Gagarin.

1130
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,086
We know. Sit down.

1131
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:52,119
All right, give them a break.

1132
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:00,761
Is it true you were ready to go
and the flight was canceled?

1133
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,968
Could we have beaten the Russians?

1134
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:06,430
Why didn't we send a man up
instead of a monkey?

1135
01:45:08,093 --> 01:45:09,766
I think we ought to be...

1136
01:45:10,095 --> 01:45:13,269
...forthright, gracious,
and magnanimous and say...

1137
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:16,068
...the Russians beat the pants off us.

1138
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,229
No sense in kidding ourselves.

1139
01:45:18,395 --> 01:45:21,194
The space age has begun,
and there's plenty of work.

1140
01:45:21,357 --> 01:45:24,406
Who will be the second man in space?

1141
01:45:24,777 --> 01:45:28,122
You mean who will be the first
free man into space?

1142
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:31,621
We know it'll be Glenn.
Just tell us when.

1143
01:45:31,784 --> 01:45:32,910
That's a secret.

1144
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:37,631
I'm tired of being forthright,
gracious, and magnanimous.

1145
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:40,797
I'm tired of stupid questions
from the press.

1146
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:44,968
I'm tired of smocks, of engineers
telling us what we can't do...

1147
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:48,634
...of people saying we are not pilots.
I'm tired of monkeys.

1148
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:52,479
Most of all, I'm tired
of being second to those...

1149
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:55,937
Those darned Russians. It's time we--

1150
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,477
Got someone up there.

1151
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:00,817
Fucking A, Bubba.

1152
01:46:01,146 --> 01:46:02,193
Exactly.

1153
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:04,279
Let's get this
thing on the road.

1154
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:05,909
I'm tired of messing around.

1155
01:46:07,236 --> 01:46:10,490
We'll just tell them we're ready.
We're ready to go.

1156
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:51,535
<i>In these three weeks
since Gagarin's surprise ï¬‚ight...</i>

1157
01:46:51,697 --> 01:46:54,371
<i>...one wretched event
has followed another.</i>

1158
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:57,662
<i>People have begun to say
our rockets always blow up...</i>

1159
01:46:57,828 --> 01:47:02,174
<i>...our boys always botch it.
Some say this is not the time to try...</i>

1160
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:05,963
<i>...desperate deeds to beat the Soviets.
The question really is:</i>

1161
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:10,016
<i>Are we actually ready
to launch a man into space?</i>

1162
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:13,724
And yet out here sits a rocket,
waiting in the night.

1163
01:47:14,053 --> 01:47:17,398
Soon, one American astronaut
will climb atop that rocket...

1164
01:47:17,723 --> 01:47:21,227
...in the greatest death-defying
stunt ever broadcast.

1165
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:27,316
The identity of America's
first astronaut...

1166
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:31,829
...was not revealed until the final
moment, and everyone has asked:

1167
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:34,577
Which one will be first?

1168
01:49:06,331 --> 01:49:07,378
Not very funny, John.

1169
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:09,919
No?

1170
01:49:10,669 --> 01:49:12,671
But I do appreciate it, John.

1171
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:14,719
I surely do.

1172
01:49:29,354 --> 01:49:32,233
Dear Lord, please don't let me fuck up.

1173
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:35,744
I didn't quite copy that.
Say again, please.

1174
01:49:37,863 --> 01:49:39,831
I said, everything's A-okay.

1175
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:43,039
Well, that's what I thought you said.

1176
01:49:43,869 --> 01:49:46,713
He said everything is A-okay.

1177
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:51,135
He says everything is A-okay.
And there you have it.

1178
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,389
<i>All stations...</i>

1179
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:04,140
Roger. Auto retro-jettison switch.

1180
01:50:06,558 --> 01:50:09,027

01:50:09,186 --> 01:50:10,278
<i>Roger.</i>

<i>Landing-bag switch, auto.</i>

<i>Roger. Landing-bag switch, auto.</i>

1185
01:50:21,406 --> 01:50:24,876
<i>This is it, ladies.
This is for Life magazine.</i>

1186
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:30,500
Louise. My God,
they're after the diaper-service man.

1187
01:50:33,919 --> 01:50:36,763
Stop that, stop it.
Will you quite pushing me? Stop it.

1188
01:50:38,298 --> 01:50:40,426
We don't have a diaper-service man.

1189
01:50:40,926 --> 01:50:42,724
Get back from the door. I don't know.

1190
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:46,144
- Oh, my Lord.
- Oh, Louise, your lawn!

1191
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:49,313
Leave those diapers alone. Come on.

1192
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,566
Shut that door!

1193
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:53,905
Why are they here?

1194
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:55,616
What do they want?

1195
01:50:55,774 --> 01:50:58,402
We are here at the house
of Louise Shepard...

1196
01:50:58,569 --> 01:51:01,664
...wife of Al Shepard,
who is about to go into space.

1197
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:07,578
Yes.

1198
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:10,122
<i>Wanted to keep you
informed, Mrs. Shepard.</i>

1199
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:14,460
<i>Everything's A-okay. Nothing
to worry about. Just some delays.</i>

1200
01:51:14,793 --> 01:51:17,012
What kind of delays?

1201
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:19,799
There's another hold from NASA,
another delay.

1202
01:51:20,132 --> 01:51:23,136
And Alan Shepard sits
there patiently waiting.

1203
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:26,563
What can be going through
a man's mind at this moment?

1204
01:51:31,476 --> 01:51:33,228
Gordo.

1205
01:51:35,647 --> 01:51:37,069
I have to urinate.

1206
01:51:37,232 --> 01:51:38,358
Urinate?

1207
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:43,284
Urinate? No.
We did not think of that.

1208
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:45,324
This is only a 15-minute flight.

1209
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:47,830
The man's been up there for hours.

1210
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,662
Could he do it in his suit?

1211
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:52,377
That's dangerous.
To introduce liquid...

1212
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:56,419
...into the pure oxygen of the capsule
and the pressure suit...

1213
01:51:56,585 --> 01:51:59,680
...might cause a short circuit.
it could start a fire.

1214
01:52:00,005 --> 01:52:01,598
No. Tell him he cannot.

1215
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:10,232
Listen, they promise we'll
stop at the next gas station.

1216
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:14,361
<i>Request that you remain
in a holding pattern till then.</i>

1217
01:52:25,906 --> 01:52:27,783
You sure you just want a little smidgen?

1218
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,827
- About a half a cup.
- Nothing in it?

1219
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:32,997
- That's fine.
- All right.

1220
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:38,003
Alan had four cups of coffee
before he went to work today.

1221
01:52:45,133 --> 01:52:47,727
All this waiting is driving me crazy.

1222
01:52:51,265 --> 01:52:52,892
I had a little accident.

1223
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:14,334
Request permission to relieve bladder.

1224
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:18,959
<i>Gordo?</i>

1225
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:24,097
<i>Gordo?</i>

1226
01:53:24,256 --> 01:53:27,100
Look, the man has got to go.

1227
01:53:28,593 --> 01:53:32,097
It's either that or we get the
lug wrench and pry him out.

1228
01:53:33,432 --> 01:53:35,605
Do it in the suit.

1229
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:42,358
JosÃ©, permission granted...

1230
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:45,285
<i>...to wet your diapers anytime, son.</i>

1231
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:49,156
Mm.

1232
01:53:56,955 --> 01:53:59,003
Freon flow jumping from...

1233
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:00,634
...30 to 45.

1234
01:54:00,876 --> 01:54:02,628
Left lower chest sensor.

1235
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:09,267
No shortcut. Moving up back.

1236
01:54:13,638 --> 01:54:16,608
Well, I'm a wetback now.

1237
01:54:19,102 --> 01:54:21,025
It is questionable if we can proceed.

1238
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:25,614
I'm cooler than you are.
Fix your problems and light this candle.

1239
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:28,655
He's right. Let's light this candle.

1240
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:30,864
He surely is. Light the candle.

1241
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,454
Yes. Resume the countdown.

1242
01:54:36,161 --> 01:54:38,414
All systems go.

1243
01:54:42,292 --> 01:54:43,464
<i>T minus 10 seconds...</i>

1244
01:54:43,627 --> 01:54:47,382
<i>...nine, eight, seven...</i>

1245
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:53,020
<i>...six, five, four, three, two...</i>

1246
01:54:53,178 --> 01:54:55,146
...one. Ignition.

1247
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:06,233
<i>You're on your way, JosÃ©.</i>

1248
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:09,028
We have liftoff,
and the clock is operating.

1249
01:55:18,203 --> 01:55:20,205
<i>I think we'll be able to talk...</i>

1250
01:55:20,372 --> 01:55:23,171
<i>...to one of the wives,
if not to Louise Shepard herself.</i>

1251
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:48,070
Mm.

1252
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:51,532
<i>He has re-entered
the earth's atmosphere...</i>

1253
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:53,948
<i>...and the G-forces should be
building up.</i>

1254
01:55:54,114 --> 01:55:56,412
Louise, he's coming down.

1255
01:55:58,285 --> 01:56:00,583
We almost missed this.

1256
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:06,422
Eight.

1257
01:56:07,752 --> 01:56:09,254
That's nine.

1258
01:56:10,255 --> 01:56:11,757
I'm okay.

1259
01:56:12,799 --> 01:56:19,808
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

1260
01:56:22,392 --> 01:56:24,190
I'm okay.

1261
01:57:02,682 --> 01:57:05,811
<i>The vice president,
who is chairman of our Space Council...</i>

1262
01:57:06,144 --> 01:57:11,401
<i>...and who bears responsibilities in this field,
and the members of the House and Senate...</i>

1263
01:57:11,566 --> 01:57:15,662
<i>...and the Space Committee
who are with us today...</i>

1264
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:18,664
<i>...this decoration,
which is going from the ground up.</i>

1265
01:57:42,514 --> 01:57:44,892
<i>Louise. What was Jackie like?</i>

1266
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:50,196
<i>Very nice.
We talked about all kinds of things.</i>

1267
01:57:50,522 --> 01:57:54,527
<i>My Gus goes up next. I can't wait
to talk to Jackie after that.</i>

1268
01:57:54,859 --> 01:57:58,033
<i>You'll love her. She's so nice.
We talked about the kids.</i>

1269
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:15,464
- Oh, Alan, hi.
- Mr. Shepard.

1270
01:58:17,048 --> 01:58:19,221
Mr. Shepard, sign here.

1271
01:58:21,386 --> 01:58:23,559
Oh, Gus.

1272
01:58:23,722 --> 01:58:25,724
I never realized...

1273
01:58:26,391 --> 01:58:31,067
...a gruff, mean son of a bitch
like you could be so popular.

1274
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:35,109
How'd you get to go up there before me?

1275
01:58:35,275 --> 01:58:37,403
Even before Mr. Clean, the Marine.

1276
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:41,247
Charm, Hot Dog. Pure charm.

1277
01:58:41,573 --> 01:58:42,916
Watch this.

1278
01:58:44,909 --> 01:58:46,536
Hey, sis, how are you doing?

1279
01:58:46,703 --> 01:58:48,546
So-so. How are you doing?

1280
01:58:48,705 --> 01:58:50,127
I ain't doing anymore.

1281
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:52,918
Thing's dragging in the mud,
and I can't get it up.

1282
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:57,264
That's pure charm.

1283
01:58:59,883 --> 01:59:01,806
How'd you like one of these?

1284
01:59:02,427 --> 01:59:04,850
I can get one of those
from a dime store.

1285
01:59:05,013 --> 01:59:07,607
Not one that's been in outer space.

1286
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:10,439
I'm taking these up with me tomorrow.

1287
01:59:11,436 --> 01:59:14,781
Would you like a souvenir
after I get written in history?

1288
01:59:15,106 --> 01:59:18,451
Well, I might,
if it's been in outer space.

1289
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,783
See you after outer space.

1290
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:23,456
All right.

1291
01:59:29,245 --> 01:59:31,964
Hey, Hot Dog. Listen.

1292
01:59:32,123 --> 01:59:34,467
You got to look to the future.

1293
01:59:35,126 --> 01:59:38,130
Folks have a taste for things
that have been there.

1294
01:59:39,255 --> 01:59:40,598
Right.

1295
01:59:40,799 --> 01:59:45,475
I'll give you one of these dimes
I'm taking up so you can play with it...

1296
01:59:46,805 --> 01:59:49,149
...and dream about outer space.

1297
01:59:51,643 --> 01:59:55,113
Why don't you just make sure
you don't screw the pooch?

1298
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:01,240
Oh, God, look at this.

1299
02:00:09,953 --> 02:00:11,170
Go get them,
Deke.

1300
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:25,514
<i>Grissom
has just reached the apex of his ï¬‚ight.</i>

1301
02:00:32,225 --> 02:00:35,149
<i>He will be re-entering
the atmosphere now.</i>

1302
02:01:16,352 --> 02:01:21,199
<i>Liberty Bell 7, Liberty Bell 7,
this is Hunt Club 1. Over.</i>

1303
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:24,699
<i>We're in orbit around the capsule.</i>

1304
02:01:27,822 --> 02:01:30,200
Are you ready to come in and hook on?

1305
02:01:31,534 --> 02:01:34,162
<i>Roger. This is Hunt Club 1</i>

1306
02:01:34,329 --> 02:01:36,878
<i>...waiting for your okay
to come in and hook on.</i>

1307
02:01:42,378 --> 02:01:47,054
Roger. I've unplugged my suit,
so I'm kind of warm now.

1308
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,394
<i>Hunt Club 1. Roger.</i>

1309
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,063
One, Roger.

1310
02:01:52,388 --> 02:01:55,392
<i>Roger. Blow the hatch after we hook on.</i>

1311
02:01:56,476 --> 02:01:59,571
<i>All right, get ready.
Another 15 feet to the right.</i>

1312
02:02:03,399 --> 02:02:05,743
If you're ready for me
to blow the hatch...

1313
02:02:06,736 --> 02:02:08,738
...I'll take my helmet off.

1314
02:02:10,406 --> 02:02:12,374
<i>Say again, Liberty Bell.</i>

1315
02:02:12,575 --> 02:02:14,418
<i>Waiting for your okay to hook on.</i>

1316
02:02:18,581 --> 02:02:20,254
Who designed this?

1317
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:24,087
<i>Say again, Liberty Bell.
We can't hear you.</i>

1318
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:25,922
I can't get it off.

1319
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:31,269
<i>Liberty Bell, say again.</i>

1320
02:02:32,345 --> 02:02:33,892
<i>Waiting for your okay.</i>

1321
02:02:40,937 --> 02:02:41,984
What happened?

1322
02:02:45,275 --> 02:02:48,654
<i>It's all right. He's okay.
Go for the capsule.</i>

1323
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:50,447
Help, I'm sinking!

1324
02:02:51,781 --> 02:02:54,034
He can float in that suit.

1325
02:02:58,705 --> 02:03:00,673
We need the data in the capsule.

1326
02:03:00,832 --> 02:03:02,755
Throw down a line!

1327
02:03:13,011 --> 02:03:15,389
Help! Throw down the line!

1328
02:03:18,766 --> 02:03:20,393
Hey, I'm sinking!

1329
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,358
Forget the fucking capsule!

1330
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:28,994
<i>MAN 2
We can't pull it. It's full of water.</i>

1331
02:03:29,986 --> 02:03:32,660
Hey! Help me over here!

1332
02:03:38,578 --> 02:03:39,625
We've lost it.

1333
02:03:39,787 --> 02:03:41,414
Blow the cable.

1334
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:47,178
Come back here!

1335
02:03:58,348 --> 02:04:00,191
Throw a line down.

1336
02:04:57,573 --> 02:04:59,075
I didn't do anything.

1337
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:01,912
I was just lying there.

1338
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:04,255
It just blew.

1339
02:05:07,917 --> 02:05:10,011
The hatch just blew.

1340
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:25,356
it must have been a
technical malfunction.

1341
02:05:26,769 --> 02:05:29,113
The capsule was rocking around a bit.

1342
02:05:29,439 --> 02:05:33,785
There were no loose items. I don't
see how I could have hit the button.

1343
02:05:35,278 --> 02:05:39,624
I was just lying there,
flat on my back, and it just blew.

1344
02:05:40,825 --> 02:05:42,998
Thank you, Mr. Grissom.

1345
02:05:52,628 --> 02:05:54,972
Well, what do you think?

1346
02:05:58,301 --> 02:06:02,147
Explosive hatches have been
on jet fighters for 10 years.

1347
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:05,146
The things have been
wrung inside out...

1348
02:06:05,475 --> 02:06:09,651
...subjected to trial by heat,
by water, by shaking, pounding.

1349
02:06:10,313 --> 02:06:14,989
We even drop them from a height
of 100 feet onto concrete...

1350
02:06:16,152 --> 02:06:19,827
...and not one of them
has ever "just blown."

1351
02:07:32,103 --> 02:07:34,447
Are we going to the White House?

1352
02:07:36,899 --> 02:07:38,901
Isn't the president coming?

1353
02:07:40,236 --> 02:07:43,410
- Gus.
- Uh...

1354
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:47,084
No ticker-tape parade in New York?

1355
02:07:47,994 --> 02:07:49,416
Uh-uh.

1356
02:07:49,579 --> 02:07:52,082
Not even one in Mitchell, Indiana?

1357
02:07:53,249 --> 02:07:54,671
Nope.

1358
02:07:57,753 --> 02:08:00,723
- No Jackie?
- Mm-mm.

1359
02:08:08,598 --> 02:08:11,602
By order of the president
of the United States...

1360
02:08:12,435 --> 02:08:15,109
...the Distinguished Service Medal...

1361
02:08:15,771 --> 02:08:19,776
...is awarded to
Captain Virgil I. Grissom...

1362
02:08:21,611 --> 02:08:26,287
...who distinguished himself by valor
above and beyond the call of duty.

1363
02:08:27,617 --> 02:08:32,123
These actions reflect great
credit upon himself...

1364
02:08:32,788 --> 02:08:34,631
...the Air Force...

1365
02:08:35,458 --> 02:08:38,462
...and the United States of America.

1366
02:08:42,632 --> 02:08:44,305
Yo, Gus!

1367
02:08:44,467 --> 02:08:46,595
Attaboy, Gus.

1368
02:08:51,474 --> 02:08:52,817
You proud, boys?

1369
02:09:03,486 --> 02:09:07,161
Hey, look.
They filled up the refrigerator.

1370
02:09:09,659 --> 02:09:11,002
Pretty good, huh?

1371
02:09:12,328 --> 02:09:15,673
Pretty good. A full refrigerator!

1372
02:09:17,166 --> 02:09:20,010
I can see this afternoon
shaping up just great.

1373
02:09:20,503 --> 02:09:23,347
And the rest of the day. Tomorrow too.

1374
02:09:23,673 --> 02:09:26,347
What do they want me to do in here?

1375
02:09:26,676 --> 02:09:28,019
Cook?

1376
02:09:29,011 --> 02:09:31,855
Then risk my life and my kids'...

1377
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:35,685
...by crossing that highway
to the worst beach in Florida.

1378
02:09:36,519 --> 02:09:40,023
Oh, Gus, I wanted to eat
in the White House.

1379
02:09:40,523 --> 02:09:43,367
I wanted to talk to Jackie about...

1380
02:09:44,527 --> 02:09:45,870
...things.

1381
02:09:47,363 --> 02:09:51,368
Well, look, I've got to go
to the Holiday Inn for some...

1382
02:09:51,742 --> 02:09:53,039
...beer call with the guys.

1383
02:09:53,828 --> 02:09:55,876
No!

1384
02:09:58,374 --> 02:10:01,218
All those years of test flying...

1385
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:06,387
...and all those times I waited
and all those times you weren't there.

1386
02:10:07,717 --> 02:10:09,719
The military promised...

1387
02:10:10,052 --> 02:10:14,728
...and now they are welshing
on that damn compact.

1388
02:10:15,224 --> 02:10:18,068
Look, I am finally
Mrs. Honorable Astronaut.

1389
02:10:18,394 --> 02:10:20,738
But they are treating me like I'm...

1390
02:10:22,398 --> 02:10:24,901
...Honorable Mrs. Squirming
Hatch Blower.

1391
02:10:25,234 --> 02:10:27,077
I didn't do anything wrong!

1392
02:10:27,403 --> 02:10:32,079
The hatch just blew! It was a glitch!
It was a technical malfunction!

1393
02:10:32,408 --> 02:10:34,752
Why in hell won't anyone believe me?

1394
02:10:41,584 --> 02:10:43,586
I know that.

1395
02:10:46,756 --> 02:10:48,258
Oh.

1396
02:10:48,758 --> 02:10:51,602
Gus, I mean are these the goodies?

1397
02:10:53,095 --> 02:10:57,942
Is this how the military pays off? Huh?

1398
02:11:00,936 --> 02:11:03,780
Oh, Gus, they owe you.

1399
02:11:06,609 --> 02:11:08,452
But they owe me too.

1400
02:11:09,779 --> 02:11:11,622
They owe me.

1401
02:11:12,114 --> 02:11:14,788
They owe me. They owe me so much.

1402
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:27,922
Oh, no.

1403
02:11:56,826 --> 02:11:58,248
I love you.

1404
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:06,511
We are here with Virgil I. Grissom
and his lovely wife Betty.

1405
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:09,638
Uh, Gus has just come back
from outer space.

1406
02:12:09,797 --> 02:12:12,346
How do you feel about this trip?

1407
02:12:12,842 --> 02:12:14,515
I'm so proud of him.

1408
02:12:14,844 --> 02:12:16,391
I think he was wonderful.

1409
02:12:16,554 --> 02:12:18,852
<i>Uh, we're all proud of Gus Grissom.</i>

1410
02:12:19,014 --> 02:12:22,188
<i>Gus, do you feel the trip
was a success?</i>

1411
02:12:22,518 --> 02:12:24,270
<i>It was A-okay.</i>

1412
02:12:26,689 --> 02:12:30,193
My God. He lost his capsule
but he's keeping his story.

1413
02:12:30,359 --> 02:12:32,612
<i>To recap yesterday's events...</i>

1414
02:12:32,778 --> 02:12:35,577
<i>...here we see America's
newest hero, Gus Grissom.</i>

1415
02:12:35,739 --> 02:12:38,868
<i>He is shouting to save
the capsule first.</i>

1416
02:12:39,743 --> 02:12:42,542
To pull all that in flight test,
it's all over for him.

1417
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:47,384
He screwed the pooch.
Plain and simple.

1418
02:12:47,543 --> 02:12:51,218
Sometimes you get a pooch
that can't be screwed.

1419
02:12:53,048 --> 02:12:56,052
The president's got his own problems
with the Bay of Pigs.

1420
02:12:56,218 --> 02:12:58,437
He doesn't want the Astronauts' image
tarnished.

1421
02:12:58,596 --> 02:13:01,395
Nothing these guys do is going
to be called failure.

1422
02:13:01,557 --> 02:13:03,230
<i>These Astronauts are our Davids.</i>

1423
02:13:03,392 --> 02:13:07,613
The public knows they're just
doing what monkeys have done.

1424
02:13:08,397 --> 02:13:10,115
Monkeys?

1425
02:13:11,233 --> 02:13:14,908
You think a monkey knows he's sitting
on a rocket that might explode?

1426
02:13:16,947 --> 02:13:18,574
These astronauts know that.

1427
02:13:20,284 --> 02:13:21,831
I'll tell you something.

1428
02:13:22,912 --> 02:13:25,836
It takes a special man to volunteer
for a suicide mission.

1429
02:13:25,998 --> 02:13:27,841
Especially when it's on TV.

1430
02:13:32,087 --> 02:13:34,089
Old Gus, he did all right.

1431
02:13:34,423 --> 02:13:36,175
<i>Though the capsule was lost...</i>

1432
02:13:36,342 --> 02:13:39,141
<i>...our new hero,
Astronaut Gus Grissom, was saved.</i>

1433
02:13:39,595 --> 02:13:43,941
<i>Now President Kennedy has started
an even more ambitious space program.</i>

1434
02:13:44,266 --> 02:13:46,314
<i>Those who came before us...</i>

1435
02:13:46,477 --> 02:13:48,445
...made certain this country...

1436
02:13:48,604 --> 02:13:52,609
...rode the first waves
of the Industrial Revolution...

1437
02:13:53,275 --> 02:13:58,031
...the first waves of modern invention,
and the first wave of nuclear power.

1438
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:01,284
<i>And this generation does not intend...</i>

1439
02:14:01,951 --> 02:14:03,453
<i>...to founder in the backwash...</i>

1440
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:08,291
<i>...of the coming age of space.
We mean to be a part of it.</i>

1441
02:14:08,457 --> 02:14:09,800
<i>We mean to lead it.</i>

1442
02:16:07,451 --> 02:16:10,045
You know, I always hated flying.

1443
02:16:12,581 --> 02:16:17,428
When I met you, you were already
a pilot, so I never had a complaint.

1444
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:21,265
When you went up in those
planes, me and the kids...

1445
02:16:26,595 --> 02:16:30,600
We never had any insurance
except a couple months' pay.

1446
02:16:32,434 --> 02:16:35,608
I always hated all that
talk about insurance.

1447
02:16:36,939 --> 02:16:40,443
The government spends all
kinds of time and money...

1448
02:16:40,651 --> 02:16:43,325
...teaching pilots how to be fearless.

1449
02:16:45,948 --> 02:16:49,293
But they don't spend a penny
teaching you how to be...

1450
02:16:49,952 --> 02:16:52,455
...the fearless wife of a test pilot.

1451
02:16:57,459 --> 02:16:59,302
But I guess I liked it.

1452
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:07,978
I guess I liked the kind
of man who could...

1453
02:17:09,304 --> 02:17:11,648
...push the outside of the envelope.

1454
02:17:14,309 --> 02:17:15,652
Flyboy.

1455
02:17:18,814 --> 02:17:23,490
But I never could stand a man who
was one of those, um, "remember-whens."

1456
02:17:24,236 --> 02:17:28,833
Those bitter guys that just sit around
thinking about old times.

1457
02:17:35,164 --> 02:17:37,166
If I ever see that happen...

1458
02:17:41,003 --> 02:17:43,176
...I'm going right out the front door.

1459
02:17:47,676 --> 02:17:49,519
And you'll never catch me.

1460
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:54,354
I'm a fearless man,
but I'm scared to death of you.

1461
02:17:54,683 --> 02:17:56,356
No, you're not.

1462
02:17:57,269 --> 02:17:59,192
But you ought to be.

1463
02:18:21,585 --> 02:18:22,882
What is it?

1464
02:18:24,087 --> 02:18:25,634
<i>The Russians have sent Titov up.</i>

1465
02:18:26,381 --> 02:18:27,724
Titov's up.

1466
02:18:28,217 --> 02:18:30,595
<i>- How long?
- A day.</i>

1467
02:18:30,761 --> 02:18:32,889
A day? A whole day'?

1468
02:18:33,222 --> 02:18:35,725
<i>He's orbiting over
our country right now.</i>

1469
02:18:36,391 --> 02:18:38,894
<i>We need a man in orbit
or it's all over.</i>

1470
02:18:39,228 --> 02:18:42,482
<i>We're scrapping the Redstone
and going with the Atlas.</i>

1471
02:18:42,648 --> 02:18:46,619
You know we haven't had
too much luck with that rocket.

1472
02:18:47,402 --> 02:18:50,451
We can't take
all the precautions we'd like.

1473
02:18:50,614 --> 02:18:52,616
<i>- It'll be dangerous.
- We're ready.</i>

1474
02:18:52,783 --> 02:18:54,535
I said it'll be dangerous.

1475
02:18:54,701 --> 02:18:57,124
I said we're ready. One hundred percent.

1476
02:18:57,287 --> 02:18:59,335
<i>Thank you, John.</i>

1477
02:19:11,134 --> 02:19:15,389
Inside this trim, modest
suburban home is Annie Glenn...

1478
02:19:15,597 --> 02:19:17,816
<i>...wife of astronaut John Glenn...</i>

1479
02:19:18,141 --> 02:19:22,521
<i>...sharing the anxiety and pride
of the world at this tense moment...</i>

1480
02:19:22,688 --> 02:19:26,693
<i>...but in a private and crucial way
that only she can understand.</i>

1481
02:19:33,490 --> 02:19:36,835
The vice president
would like to see Mrs. Glenn.

1482
02:19:37,327 --> 02:19:38,874
He's asking for you again.

1483
02:19:40,163 --> 02:19:41,881
Tell them no.

1484
02:19:42,499 --> 02:19:44,501
I'm sorry, she says no.

1485
02:19:44,751 --> 02:19:48,426
This is very important.
The vice president must see her.

1486
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:50,223
No.

1487
02:19:51,466 --> 02:19:53,434
<i>After the mission's success...</i>

1488
02:19:53,635 --> 02:19:55,387
<i>...the vice president...</i>

1489
02:19:55,554 --> 02:19:57,807
<i>...will speak with Annie Glenn.</i>

1490
02:19:57,973 --> 02:20:01,648
<i>Meanwhile, John Glenn
waits for the weather to clear...</i>

1491
02:20:01,810 --> 02:20:04,734
<i>...so he can undertake
this historic mission.</i>

1492
02:20:04,897 --> 02:20:06,865
You know what the Russians want?

1493
02:20:08,483 --> 02:20:09,530
No, sir.

1494
02:20:09,693 --> 02:20:12,196
They want our peckers in their pockets.

1495
02:20:15,657 --> 02:20:18,706
- She still says no.
- No?

1496
02:20:18,869 --> 02:20:22,715
Didn't you tell her
I'll bring in ABC-TV...

1497
02:20:22,873 --> 02:20:26,548
...NBC-TV, CBS-TV?

1498
02:20:26,710 --> 02:20:31,056
Her words, and mine,
will be heard by millions.

1499
02:20:40,223 --> 02:20:41,440
Where are they going?

1500
02:20:44,186 --> 02:20:46,154
The flight's been canceled.

1501
02:20:46,313 --> 02:20:48,031
Canceled?

1502
02:20:50,067 --> 02:20:51,740
That's perfect.

1503
02:20:52,069 --> 02:20:56,745
I will go in and console
her on nationwide TV.

1504
02:20:57,074 --> 02:20:59,543
I'll pay her a sympathy call.

1505
02:21:00,077 --> 02:21:01,704
Yes, sir.

1506
02:21:27,771 --> 02:21:32,652
The vice president would like to
make a sympathy call if he could.

1507
02:21:32,818 --> 02:21:35,446
- No.
- No.

1508
02:21:35,612 --> 02:21:38,491
- No? What do you mean no?
- I mean no.

1509
02:21:38,657 --> 02:21:40,751
What do you mean no?

1510
02:21:40,909 --> 02:21:43,128
Get NASA on the line.

1511
02:21:43,286 --> 02:21:47,712
I'm going to lean on NASA.
I'm going right to the top.

1512
02:21:47,874 --> 02:21:49,547
- Right away.
- To the top.

1513
02:21:49,751 --> 02:21:54,131
Damn right.
They better tell her to play ball.

1514
02:21:58,927 --> 02:22:00,850
Hey, guys.

1515
02:22:02,305 --> 02:22:04,182
There's a problem with your wife.

1516
02:22:04,349 --> 02:22:06,067
- Is it serious?
- We think it is.

1517
02:22:06,268 --> 02:22:08,145
There's a phone hook-up,
we've got her on.

1518
02:22:15,944 --> 02:22:17,321
Annie?

1519
02:22:17,487 --> 02:22:21,367
It's me. Are you all right?
What's wrong?

1520
02:22:21,533 --> 02:22:23,331
Johnson...

1521
02:22:25,495 --> 02:22:27,168
<i>...wants me...</i>

1522
02:22:31,001 --> 02:22:33,504
...on TV.

1523
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:34,842
The vice president?

1524
02:22:35,005 --> 02:22:38,680
Tell her to let him in with the networks.
It's coverage.

1525
02:22:43,346 --> 02:22:46,350
It's important, John. It means a lot.

1526
02:22:49,519 --> 02:22:51,146
Annie.

1527
02:22:52,689 --> 02:22:54,157
Listen to me.

1528
02:22:54,316 --> 02:22:56,284
<i>Are you listening?</i>

1529
02:22:56,443 --> 02:22:58,946
If you don't want the vice president...

1530
02:22:59,112 --> 02:23:02,787
...or the networks, or anyone else
in our house, that's it.

1531
02:23:02,949 --> 02:23:05,702
As far as I'm concerned,
they are not coming in.

1532
02:23:05,869 --> 02:23:11,046
And I will back you up 100 percent,
and you tell them that. Okay?

1533
02:23:11,208 --> 02:23:15,714
I don't want Johnson or the others
to even put a toe in our house.

1534
02:23:20,842 --> 02:23:21,843
Okay.

1535
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:26,732
You tell them that astronaut
John Glenn told you to say that.

1536
02:23:29,726 --> 02:23:32,229
<i>- All right?
- Yes.</i>

1537
02:23:35,065 --> 02:23:36,908
I'll talk to you soon.

1538
02:23:42,405 --> 02:23:43,907
You can't do that.

1539
02:23:44,157 --> 02:23:46,034
The vice president's
head of the program!

1540
02:23:46,201 --> 02:23:47,919
You must think of the program!

1541
02:23:48,078 --> 02:23:49,295
You are out of line!

1542
02:23:49,454 --> 02:23:51,502
- I'm out of line?
- Yes, sir!

1543
02:23:52,582 --> 02:23:54,255
I run the show here.

1544
02:23:54,501 --> 02:23:56,094
- We'll see about that!
- Yeah?

1545
02:23:56,253 --> 02:23:59,097
And I'm thinking of changing
the order of flight assignments!

1546
02:23:59,256 --> 02:24:00,428
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

1547
02:24:00,590 --> 02:24:02,388
- Who will you get?
- Who am I gonna get?

1548
02:24:02,551 --> 02:24:04,269
You heard what he said.

1549
02:24:09,891 --> 02:24:11,518
Take it easy, fellows.

1550
02:24:11,935 --> 02:24:13,778
Step aside.

1551
02:24:25,448 --> 02:24:26,791
Pilots.

1552
02:24:30,287 --> 02:24:32,289
Pansies! Cows!

1553
02:24:34,958 --> 02:24:36,460
Gladiolas!

1554
02:24:36,793 --> 02:24:41,139
Isn't there anybody who can
deal with a housewife?

1555
02:24:50,932 --> 02:24:56,063
<i>Oh, you'll come
a-waltzing, Matilda, with me</i>

1556
02:24:56,229 --> 02:25:03,238
<i>And he sang as he watched
And waited till his billy boil</i>

1557
02:25:06,823 --> 02:25:09,167
I thought Hank Williams
wrote "Waltzing Matilda. "

1558
02:25:09,492 --> 02:25:11,460
We don't know who wrote it.

1559
02:25:11,661 --> 02:25:14,665
- It's Australian, right?
- Yep.

1560
02:25:16,541 --> 02:25:20,171
- Good day, mate.
- Hi.

1561
02:25:22,172 --> 02:25:23,845
Who are you guys?

1562
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:28,853
We're Aborigines.

1563
02:25:29,471 --> 02:25:31,690
Aborigines, eh?

1564
02:25:32,474 --> 02:25:34,147
Hi.

1565
02:25:34,309 --> 02:25:35,356
Who are you?

1566
02:25:35,852 --> 02:25:40,733
Me? I'm an astronaut.

1567
02:25:41,274 --> 02:25:43,652
- Astronaut.
- Yeah.

1568
02:25:44,527 --> 02:25:47,246
Well, what do you do here, astronaut?

1569
02:25:47,405 --> 02:25:52,036
I'm here because a buddy
of mine is getting ready to...

1570
02:25:52,702 --> 02:25:55,706
...fly overhead. Up in outer space.

1571
02:25:55,872 --> 02:25:58,876
And I'll be talking to him
on that dish.

1572
02:25:59,376 --> 02:26:01,629
- Fly over?
- Yeah.

1573
02:26:01,795 --> 02:26:03,217
You blokes do that too?

1574
02:26:03,672 --> 02:26:05,970
Heh. You do that yourself?

1575
02:26:06,132 --> 02:26:08,976
Not me, mate.

1576
02:26:09,135 --> 02:26:10,307
See that old bloke there?

1577
02:26:12,514 --> 02:26:13,561
He know.

1578
02:26:13,723 --> 02:26:15,225
He know the moon.

1579
02:26:16,059 --> 02:26:17,652
He know the star.

1580
02:26:18,395 --> 02:26:20,568
And he know the Milky Way.

1581
02:26:21,523 --> 02:26:22,695
He'll give you a hand.

1582
02:26:24,067 --> 02:26:25,239
He know.

1583
02:26:29,406 --> 02:26:32,250
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

1584
02:27:02,188 --> 02:27:04,941
<i>Stand by for final ten-second count.</i>

1585
02:28:06,503 --> 02:28:08,380
The clock is operating.

1586
02:28:09,172 --> 02:28:11,015
<i>We're under way.</i>

1587
02:28:16,346 --> 02:28:20,192
<i>Good Lord,
ride all the way. God speed, John Glenn.</i>

1588
02:29:34,924 --> 02:29:37,518
Zero G, and I feel fine.

1589
02:29:39,095 --> 02:29:41,598
<i>The capsule is turning around.</i>

1590
02:29:42,557 --> 02:29:44,651
<i>Oh!</i>

1591
02:29:45,101 --> 02:29:47,320
The view is tremendous.

1592
02:29:47,479 --> 02:29:51,609
I can see clear back,
a big cloud pattern, towards the Cape.

1593
02:29:51,941 --> 02:29:53,784
It's a beautiful sight!

1594
02:29:53,943 --> 02:29:58,790
Roger, Friendship 7.
You have a go, at least seven orbits.

1595
02:30:03,119 --> 02:30:08,467
<i>Roger, Al. Understand, go at least seven orbits.</i>

1596
02:30:34,317 --> 02:30:38,288
Speed is 17,500 miles per hour...

1597
02:30:45,828 --> 02:30:48,172
...and we're moving into night.

1598
02:31:08,935 --> 02:31:10,937
Full moon rising.

1599
02:31:15,024 --> 02:31:16,901
I can almost touch it.

1600
02:31:32,375 --> 02:31:35,219
Friendship 7, come in.
Do you read?

1601
02:31:36,087 --> 02:31:37,464
Hello, Friendship 7?

1602
02:31:39,048 --> 02:31:40,891
Friendship 7, come in please.

1603
02:31:41,217 --> 02:31:42,890
This sure was a short day.

1604
02:31:43,219 --> 02:31:44,892
Say again, please.

1605
02:31:45,388 --> 02:31:48,392
That was the shortest day
I've run into.

1606
02:31:48,558 --> 02:31:50,731
<i>Kind of passes rapidly, huh?</i>

1607
02:31:51,477 --> 02:31:53,150
Yes, sir.

1608
02:31:54,647 --> 02:31:56,024
I can see lights...

1609
02:31:56,190 --> 02:31:58,158
...down there in Australia.

1610
02:31:58,693 --> 02:31:59,865
Where are they from?

1611
02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:05,246
All of Perth and Rockingham
have turned their lights on for you.

1612
02:32:05,408 --> 02:32:07,206
And a few other lights...

1613
02:32:07,368 --> 02:32:09,291
...are turned on too.

1614
02:32:14,626 --> 02:32:18,130
They show up very well.
Thank everybody...

1615
02:32:18,296 --> 02:32:20,390
...for turning them on, will you?

1616
02:32:20,590 --> 02:32:23,434
<i>We sure will, John.
We sure will.</i>

1617
02:32:40,276 --> 02:32:42,278
Heading towards daybreak.

1618
02:33:21,651 --> 02:33:23,824
Lot of cloud coverage today.

1619
02:33:31,661 --> 02:33:33,504
It's beautiful.

1620
02:33:48,469 --> 02:33:49,891
Possibly it's the heat shield.

1621
02:33:50,847 --> 02:33:52,144
It's loose.

1622
02:33:54,767 --> 02:33:55,984
If it comes off--

1623
02:33:56,144 --> 02:33:57,737
He'll burn up.

1624
02:33:59,772 --> 02:34:02,321
He'll fry if he tries to re-enter.

1625
02:34:17,039 --> 02:34:18,757
<i>Muchea, this is Cape.</i>

1626
02:34:19,709 --> 02:34:21,552
<i>We're showing some trouble.</i>

1627
02:34:21,878 --> 02:34:24,848
<i>We've got a warning light.
Possibly a loose heat shield.</i>

1628
02:34:25,006 --> 02:34:26,849
<i>Check your status lights.</i>

1629
02:34:46,611 --> 02:34:48,284
He's coming.

1630
02:34:49,739 --> 02:34:51,741
John, can you hear me?

1631
02:34:53,826 --> 02:34:55,453
<i>Friendship 7, come in, please.</i>

1632
02:34:56,162 --> 02:34:57,835
Try something. Anything.

1633
02:34:58,039 --> 02:34:59,712
<i>Friendship 7, come in.</i>

1634
02:35:34,116 --> 02:35:37,837
This is Friendship 7. Do you read me?

1635
02:35:39,455 --> 02:35:40,957
<i>Wait a second.</i>

1636
02:35:42,625 --> 02:35:44,969
I see something strange out here.

1637
02:35:45,294 --> 02:35:48,468
Oh, my goodness,
what the heck is that?

1638
02:35:49,465 --> 02:35:52,844
<i>Sparks and needles of some kind
all over the sky.</i>

1639
02:35:53,010 --> 02:35:56,264
<i>Hey, let me tell you
what I'm in up here.</i>

1640
02:35:56,430 --> 02:35:58,979
I'm in a mass of very
small particles...

1641
02:35:59,308 --> 02:36:02,152
...that are brilliantly lit up.
They're luminescent.

1642
02:36:02,645 --> 02:36:04,647
I never saw anything like it.

1643
02:36:05,523 --> 02:36:07,400
A shower of them coming by now.

1644
02:36:07,650 --> 02:36:10,699
They're bright yellow.
They swirl around the capsule...

1645
02:36:10,862 --> 02:36:13,331
...and they're brilliantly lighted.

1646
02:36:14,490 --> 02:36:17,334
Do you think they could be alive?

1647
02:36:19,537 --> 02:36:22,711
<i>It sounds ridiculous,
but they look like fireï¬‚ies.</i>

1648
02:36:23,082 --> 02:36:25,505
<i>Heh, heh. Whoa.</i>

1649
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:29,840
Whoa. Maybe some Air Force
experiment went amuck.

1650
02:36:30,006 --> 02:36:32,100
Could our astronomers
have been wrong?

1651
02:36:32,258 --> 02:36:36,013
<i>Hello, Cap Com, do you read me?
This is miraculous.</i>

1652
02:36:36,762 --> 02:36:40,016
Could it be those fireï¬‚ies,
or whatever they are?

1653
02:36:40,182 --> 02:36:42,276
Of course not. Fireï¬‚ies?

1654
02:36:42,435 --> 02:36:44,654
<i>Hello, Cap Com?</i>

1655
02:36:44,937 --> 02:36:47,031
Roger, Friendship 7.

1656
02:36:48,190 --> 02:36:51,194
Will you correlate
the actions of the particles...

1657
02:36:51,527 --> 02:36:53,529
...with that of your control jets?

1658
02:36:54,822 --> 02:36:56,870
Uh, negative.

1659
02:36:57,533 --> 02:37:01,163
I do not think they were
coming from my control jets.

1660
02:37:02,204 --> 02:37:06,960
<i>Listen, I'm gonna try to get
some pictures of these little guys.</i>

1661
02:37:07,168 --> 02:37:09,045
<i>Sounds like a good idea.</i>

1662
02:37:09,211 --> 02:37:12,215
You guys probably think I'm nuts.

1663
02:37:13,049 --> 02:37:14,847
They're very beautiful.

1664
02:37:15,009 --> 02:37:17,478
<i>Like fireï¬‚ies on a summer night.</i>

1665
02:37:17,678 --> 02:37:21,308
They just dance around. Ha-ha-ha.

1666
02:37:56,759 --> 02:37:58,136
Get out of here.

1667
02:38:01,097 --> 02:38:03,270
Get out of here, you gadgets.

1668
02:38:05,768 --> 02:38:08,271
Heading into daybreak now.
Another day.

1669
02:38:08,771 --> 02:38:12,742
Leaving the fireflies behind.
I have no idea what they were.

1670
02:38:13,943 --> 02:38:16,662
This is Friendship 7. Do you read me?

1671
02:38:16,821 --> 02:38:19,449
<i>That was some night.
That was really exciting.</i>

1672
02:38:19,615 --> 02:38:21,083
He's going into his third orbit.

1673
02:38:21,242 --> 02:38:24,291
How much longer are you going
to keep him in the dark?

1674
02:38:24,954 --> 02:38:26,046
What do we tell him?

1675
02:38:26,247 --> 02:38:29,126
He's a pilot.
Tell him the condition of his craft.

1676
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:37,053
<i>Glenn is in his third orbit...</i>

1677
02:38:37,258 --> 02:38:39,727
<i>...and the ï¬‚ight is going
pretty much as planned.</i>

1678
02:38:39,885 --> 02:38:41,057
<i>No human individual...</i>

1679
02:38:41,303 --> 02:38:44,477
<i>...has ever been so well-prepared.</i>

1680
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:48,235
<i>So far the key word on this
textbook flight is "operational. "</i>

1681
02:38:48,394 --> 02:38:50,271
<i>Everything is A-okay.</i>

1682
02:38:51,939 --> 02:38:54,909
<i>We haven't been lucky
with the Atlas rocket.</i>

1683
02:38:55,067 --> 02:38:58,822
<i>Some say we haven't taken all
the safety precautions we 'd like to.</i>

1684
02:38:58,988 --> 02:39:00,035
<i>Is this true ?</i>

1685
02:39:00,197 --> 02:39:02,120
<i>No, it's absolutely not true.</i>

1686
02:39:02,408 --> 02:39:05,036
The only critical point
is the re-entry.

1687
02:39:05,202 --> 02:39:08,126
If the capsule is not
at the correct angle...

1688
02:39:08,456 --> 02:39:12,177
...with the blunt end and heat
shield down, it will burn up.

1689
02:39:12,334 --> 02:39:14,382
There is only one hope.

1690
02:39:14,545 --> 02:39:19,927
Leave the retro-rocket package,
which covers the heat shield, on.

1691
02:39:20,092 --> 02:39:25,724
The straps may be strong enough
to hold the heat shield in place.

1692
02:39:25,890 --> 02:39:27,483
But if this fails...

1693
02:39:29,143 --> 02:39:32,818
<i>John, you're
going to ï¬‚y-by-wire for re-entry.</i>

1694
02:39:32,980 --> 02:39:37,156
<i>We recommend you do the best
you can to keep a zero angle. Over.</i>

1695
02:39:37,651 --> 02:39:39,653
Re-entry only three orbits?

1696
02:39:39,987 --> 02:39:41,534
<i>That is correct.</i>

1697
02:39:41,697 --> 02:39:43,825
<i>Do you have a reason for this?</i>

1698
02:39:44,158 --> 02:39:47,879
Uh, not at this time.
This is the judgment of Cape Flight.

1699
02:39:49,872 --> 02:39:51,340
Roger.

1700
02:39:51,499 --> 02:39:55,549
Uh, do you have a time for
going to jettison retro? Over.

1701
02:39:57,505 --> 02:40:00,679
<i>We are not sure
your landing bag is deployed.</i>

1702
02:40:01,008 --> 02:40:05,229
<i>We feel it is possible to re-enter
with the retro-package on.</i>

1703
02:40:05,387 --> 02:40:08,732
We see no difficulty
with that type of re-entry.

1704
02:40:08,891 --> 02:40:10,359
<i>Do you read?</i>

1705
02:40:11,185 --> 02:40:12,687
Roger.

1706
02:40:13,854 --> 02:40:15,356
Understand.

1707
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:20,411
<i>I'll line up as carefully
as I can in a minute.</i>

1708
02:40:21,195 --> 02:40:25,871
<i>See if scanners will pick it up
and correct retro-fire attitude.</i>

1709
02:40:26,534 --> 02:40:32,041
Uh, if not, I'll correct it myself.
Over.

1710
02:40:32,206 --> 02:40:33,958
<i>Roger, Friendship 7.</i>

1711
02:40:42,550 --> 02:40:44,393
<i>We're lined up.</i>

1712
02:40:45,386 --> 02:40:46,729
<i>Here we go.</i>

1713
02:41:25,426 --> 02:41:27,099
What's that sound?

1714
02:41:27,428 --> 02:41:29,055
Humming. It's him.

1715
02:41:29,221 --> 02:41:31,599
It's all right. He does that.

1716
02:42:39,917 --> 02:42:41,089
- John?
- He can't hear you.

1717
02:42:41,252 --> 02:42:44,176
He's in the ionization blackout.

1718
02:42:44,838 --> 02:42:48,012
No communications are possible
for a few minutes.

1719
02:42:50,678 --> 02:42:52,180
Then we'll know.

1720
02:43:01,689 --> 02:43:04,863
Friendship 7, this is Cape.
Do you read?

1721
02:43:11,699 --> 02:43:14,543
<i>This is Cape. Do you read?</i>

1722
02:43:18,372 --> 02:43:22,468
Friendship 7, this is Cape.
Do you read?

1723
02:43:22,626 --> 02:43:26,221
<i>Automatic systems
are not functioning. He's in fly-by-wire-</i>

1724
02:44:29,276 --> 02:44:30,949
Finally showed up.

1725
02:44:31,111 --> 02:44:34,240
The one with the big engine.

1726
02:44:35,282 --> 02:44:38,957
Boy, if we'd only had
one of those a few years back.

1727
02:44:39,620 --> 02:44:44,296
The bad news is the entire program's
probably going to be scrapped.

1728
02:44:45,876 --> 02:44:49,130
The astronaut boys in Houston
have got the only ticket.

1729
02:44:49,963 --> 02:44:53,467
Barring, of course,
some unforeseen event.

1730
02:45:15,322 --> 02:45:18,041
The Russians set a new record
of 114,000 feet...

1731
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:20,168
...going straight off the ground.

1732
02:45:20,494 --> 02:45:23,498
Nobody cares about that
kind of record anymore.

1733
02:45:23,997 --> 02:45:27,501
All they want now
is capsules up in outer space.

1734
02:45:30,003 --> 02:45:34,850
I get a feeling this plane might be
able to beat that Russian record.

1735
02:45:37,344 --> 02:45:39,062
You might be right.

1736
02:46:26,894 --> 02:46:28,896
And here they come.

1737
02:46:38,739 --> 02:46:41,367
Looky here what I brought you.

1738
02:46:52,044 --> 02:46:54,763
Mr. and Mrs. John Glenn.

1739
02:46:59,259 --> 02:47:02,559
Alan Shepard.

1740
02:47:05,307 --> 02:47:07,275
Gus Grissom.

1741
02:47:09,978 --> 02:47:13,403
Scott Carpenter.

1742
02:47:14,525 --> 02:47:17,199
Deke Slayton.

1743
02:47:19,071 --> 02:47:21,699
Wally Schirra.

1744
02:47:22,366 --> 02:47:24,710
Mrs. Gordon Cooper.

1745
02:47:24,868 --> 02:47:26,461
Smile, hon.

1746
02:47:27,329 --> 02:47:29,331
My fellow citizens...

1747
02:47:32,125 --> 02:47:37,723
...America's Mercury Astronauts.

1748
02:47:47,891 --> 02:47:49,393
Welcome to Houston...

1749
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:51,107
...your new home.

1750
02:47:51,311 --> 02:47:56,408
Your neighbors here and I, we'd like
to give you this little barbecue...

1751
02:47:58,652 --> 02:48:00,746
...Texas style!

1752
02:48:43,697 --> 02:48:48,669
Since you're relocating here, to show
our appreciation for all you've done...

1753
02:48:48,869 --> 02:48:51,292
...Mr. Sharp is contributing the land...

1754
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:53,253
...the contractors, the homes...

1755
02:48:53,415 --> 02:48:56,385
...and department stores,
the furnishings.

1756
02:48:56,752 --> 02:48:58,379
- Oh.
- That's wonderful.

1757
02:48:58,545 --> 02:49:00,422
- Which one are you?
- Shepard.

1758
02:49:01,173 --> 02:49:03,517
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1759
02:49:03,675 --> 02:49:05,973
Which one's Glenn?
I want to meet him.

1760
02:49:07,554 --> 02:49:09,101
He's over there.

1761
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:10,687
Excuse me.

1762
02:49:12,225 --> 02:49:14,102
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1763
02:49:18,398 --> 02:49:22,073
I'm going to the moon,
I swear to God, I'm on my way.

1764
02:49:22,611 --> 02:49:24,409
I mean it.

1765
02:49:25,447 --> 02:49:28,291
Hi, little gal.
Damned glad to meet you too.

1766
02:49:28,450 --> 02:49:32,125
I heard an awful lot of good things
about you gals.

1767
02:49:32,621 --> 02:49:34,623
John Glenn.

1768
02:49:36,166 --> 02:49:37,213
Howdy.

1769
02:49:37,376 --> 02:49:38,844
Oh, yeah. I wanna meet you too.

1770
02:49:39,002 --> 02:49:41,471
Ha-ha-ha.
- Whoa. Sorry, little lady.

1771
02:49:41,630 --> 02:49:46,101
We got it. Steak. All the trimmings.

1772
02:49:47,928 --> 02:49:49,771
Just like Pancho's.

1773
02:49:52,599 --> 02:49:54,772
Steak tastes about the same...

1774
02:49:55,602 --> 02:49:58,606
...only there's a lot more
trimmings now, Gus.

1775
02:50:00,941 --> 02:50:02,943
You know, it's funny.

1776
02:50:03,610 --> 02:50:08,616
Here I am, I got $25,000
a year for a magazine contract...

1777
02:50:08,949 --> 02:50:13,625
...got a free house with all
the furnishings, got me a Corvette...

1778
02:50:14,454 --> 02:50:18,129
...got a free lunch from one end
of America to the other...

1779
02:50:18,959 --> 02:50:21,303
...and I ain't even been up there yet.

1780
02:50:23,547 --> 02:50:24,844
I noticed that.

1781
02:50:25,006 --> 02:50:28,180
You noticed I hadn't been up there yet?

1782
02:50:30,971 --> 02:50:33,770
They're saving the best for last.

1783
02:50:35,642 --> 02:50:38,646
Yeah, I guess so, Hot Dog. I guess so.

1784
02:50:40,814 --> 02:50:43,158
Just watch you don't screw the pooch.

1785
02:50:48,905 --> 02:50:50,157
Uh-oh.

1786
02:50:52,617 --> 02:50:54,711
Mr. Cooper.

1787
02:51:02,836 --> 02:51:07,512
We're talking to Gordon Cooper.
He will be the next to orbit the Earth.

1788
02:51:09,718 --> 02:51:14,519
Since you're the last of the original
seven and the least well known...

1789
02:51:14,681 --> 02:51:19,027
...could you begin by telling us,
who was the best pilot you ever saw?

1790
02:51:20,020 --> 02:51:22,523
Who's the best pilot I ever saw?

1791
02:51:30,197 --> 02:51:32,700
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

1792
02:51:37,037 --> 02:51:38,380
I'll tell you.

1793
02:51:38,872 --> 02:51:43,719
I've seen a lot of them, and most
of them were pictures on a wall--

1794
02:51:43,877 --> 02:51:44,924
Excuse me--

1795
02:51:45,086 --> 02:51:49,557
I said, pictures on a wall,
back at some place that...

1796
02:51:51,384 --> 02:51:53,557
...doesn't even exist anymore.

1797
02:51:56,640 --> 02:51:57,983
Some of them are...

1798
02:51:58,141 --> 02:52:00,064
...right here in this room.

1799
02:52:01,728 --> 02:52:03,730
And some of them are...

1800
02:52:04,397 --> 02:52:08,573
...they're still out there somewhere,
doing what they always do.

1801
02:52:08,902 --> 02:52:12,076
Going up in a hurtling
piece of machinery...

1802
02:52:12,405 --> 02:52:14,749
...putting their hides
out on the line...

1803
02:52:15,575 --> 02:52:17,748
...hanging it out over the edge...

1804
02:52:18,078 --> 02:52:21,753
...pushing back the outside
of that envelope and hauling it back.

1805
02:52:24,084 --> 02:52:25,757
But there was...

1806
02:52:26,253 --> 02:52:30,759
...one pilot I once saw who I think, uh,
truly did have the right--

1807
02:52:31,091 --> 02:52:33,970
How close did you ever come
to not hauling it back?

1808
02:52:39,266 --> 02:52:41,439
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

1809
02:52:42,102 --> 02:52:44,605
Well, uh, you're looking at him.

1810
02:52:59,119 --> 02:53:00,120
Hey, Ridley?

1811
02:53:01,371 --> 02:53:02,623
Yeah?

1812
02:53:02,789 --> 02:53:04,211
You got any Beemans?

1813
02:53:05,792 --> 02:53:07,715
I might have me a stick.

1814
02:53:07,878 --> 02:53:10,256
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

1815
02:53:12,132 --> 02:53:13,634
Fair enough.

1816
02:53:14,801 --> 02:53:17,805
Think I see a plane over here
with my name on it.

1817
02:53:20,307 --> 02:53:21,980
Now you're talking.

1818
02:53:36,489 --> 02:53:37,991
Hey, what's that?

1819
02:53:38,491 --> 02:53:40,164
Anyone got clearance?

1820
02:53:44,164 --> 02:53:46,417
What kind of a plane is that?

1821
02:53:52,672 --> 02:53:54,925
Aircraft on ramp, did
you file a ï¬‚ight plan?

1822
02:53:56,509 --> 02:53:59,228
<i>Did you file a ï¬‚ight plan?</i>

1823
02:54:00,013 --> 02:54:04,063
I'm taking her up to wring her out a bit.
Any objections?

1824
02:54:04,225 --> 02:54:05,351
It's Yeager.

1825
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:09,147
No objections.

1826
02:54:09,314 --> 02:54:11,737
<i>You are clear to taxi.</i>

1827
02:54:12,859 --> 02:54:15,237
He must have clearance. Right?

1828
02:54:15,403 --> 02:54:17,451
Yeah. Sure, he must.

1829
02:54:18,114 --> 02:54:19,957
It's here someplace.

1830
02:56:24,824 --> 02:56:26,952
Now, in honor of...

1831
02:56:27,327 --> 02:56:31,298
...these, the greatest pilots
in the history of mankind...

1832
02:56:31,456 --> 02:56:36,178
...it gives me great pleasure,
great pride, to present to you...

1833
02:56:36,336 --> 02:56:39,135
...Miss Sally Rand.

1834
02:59:31,052 --> 02:59:33,146
Stretch it. Stretch it.

1835
02:59:33,304 --> 02:59:35,432
You can do it.

1836
02:59:37,016 --> 02:59:40,361
Just a little bit more,
104,000, here you go.

1837
02:59:45,817 --> 02:59:47,535
Christ Almighty.

1838
03:03:07,101 --> 03:03:08,774
Sir, over there.

1839
03:03:11,272 --> 03:03:12,740
Is that a man?

1840
03:03:15,735 --> 03:03:18,409
Yeah, you're damn right it is.

1841
03:04:09,830 --> 03:04:11,298
Uh, Gordo.

1842
03:04:16,504 --> 03:04:17,551
Gordo!

1843
03:04:18,005 --> 03:04:19,427
Ah.

1844
03:04:22,635 --> 03:04:24,262
Uh-huh?

1845
03:04:24,595 --> 03:04:27,314
We, uh, hate to disturb
you, buddy, but...

1846
03:04:27,682 --> 03:04:29,309
...we've got a launch.

1847
03:04:30,434 --> 03:04:31,481
Uh-huh.

1848
03:04:32,603 --> 03:04:36,324
There's millions of people watching,
and we thought maybe, uh...

1849
03:04:36,899 --> 03:04:39,618
Yep. Well, no sweat. Let's go.

1850
03:04:40,444 --> 03:04:44,415
I'm ready when you are,
John, 100 percent.

1851
03:04:45,866 --> 03:04:47,709
Okay.

1852
03:04:48,828 --> 03:04:51,832
Tminus 10, nine...

1853
03:04:52,832 --> 03:04:57,383
<i>...eight, seven, six, five...</i>

1854
03:04:57,545 --> 03:05:03,973
<i>...four, three, two, one.</i>

1855
03:05:33,998 --> 03:05:35,921
Go.

1856
03:05:43,382 --> 03:05:46,010
Go, Hot Dog, go!

1857
03:05:50,389 --> 03:05:53,017
"Up we go into the wild blue yonder."

1858
03:05:53,684 --> 03:05:57,188
Thirty seconds and fuel
is go, oxygen is go...

1859
03:05:57,521 --> 03:06:01,401
...cabin pressure on the top peg.
Altimeter is working.

1860
03:06:02,526 --> 03:06:04,528
Have a good ride, buddy. Go.

1861
03:06:09,116 --> 03:06:11,619
The sun is coming through the window.

1862
03:06:13,704 --> 03:06:16,423
Oh, Lord, what a heavenly light.

1863
03:06:29,595 --> 03:06:31,563
<i>The Mercury program was over.</i>

1864
03:06:32,431 --> 03:06:34,650
<i>Four years later...</i>

1865
03:06:34,809 --> 03:06:38,734
<i>...Gus Grissom was killed along with
astronauts White and Chaffee...</i>

1866
03:06:38,938 --> 03:06:41,612
<i>...when fire swept through
their Apollo capsule.</i>

1867
03:06:42,733 --> 03:06:46,954
<i>But on that glorious day
in May, 1963...</i>

1868
03:06:47,238 --> 03:06:52,620
<i>...Gordo Cooper went higher,
farther, and faster...</i>

1869
03:06:52,785 --> 03:06:57,086
<i>...than any other American. Twenty-two
complete orbits around the world.</i>

1870
03:06:57,456 --> 03:07:00,756
<i>He was the last American
ever to go into space alone.</i>

1871
03:07:01,085 --> 03:07:03,087
<i>And for a brief moment...</i>

1872
03:07:03,462 --> 03:07:09,765
<i>...Gordo Cooper became the greatest
pilot anyone had ever seen.</i>
