1
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:25,036
<i>Look at the water.</i>

2
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,787
<i>- What's this?
- Towel.</i>

3
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:31,085
<i>- What kind of towel?
- Super towel.</i>

4
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,673
<i>What does the super towel get
the super boy? Super clean, right?</i>

5
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:36,718
<i>Super boy.</i>

6
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:40,678
<i>That's super boy.
Super, super clean.</i>

7
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,969
<i>Super wet.</i>

8
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,113
<i>Who's this?</i>

9
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,594
<i>Jeremiah.</i>

10
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:52,354
<i>He's a Jeremiah.</i>

11
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:54,319
It's Jeremiah versus Moby Dick.

12
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:57,656
<i>Jeremiah was a bullfrog</i>

13
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,899
<i>Was a good friend of mine</i>

14
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:05,580
<i>Never understood a
single word he said</i>

15
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:09,534
<i>But I helped him drink his wine</i>

16
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:13,416
<i>Singing joy to the world</i>

17
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,880
<i>All the boys and girls now</i>

18
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:21,129
<i>Joy to the fishes
In the deep blue sea</i>

19
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,181
<i>Joy to you and me</i>

20
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,138
- Yes, this is Dr. Cooper.
- What's that?

21
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:29,099
Superman. Super nothing.

22
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,894
That's super nothing!

23
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:35,189
That's right, super boy is not
getting out of this tub...

24
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,189
until he's as clean as a whistle.

25
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:40,492
And super mom is going
to be very happy.

26
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:43,200
I can't move that far.

27
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:45,327
Come here. Come here. Head on down.

28
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,455
Down onto the end.

29
00:05:58,384 --> 00:05:59,746
Come on.

30
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:04,045
Right on down there.
There's a spot.

31
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,175
- Harold.
- Sam.

32
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:15,469
Christ.

33
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:19,931
- Here, I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

34
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,932
Let me put it in here.

35
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,810
You can drive this to the cemetery.

36
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,527
Oh, Christ.

37
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,197
Were you here?

38
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,407
What? No, Alex was staying
down here at the summer house.

39
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,113
Sarah and I were up at the
Richmond place with the kids.

40
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,993
- Well, you're looking fit.
- So are you.

41
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,264
Listen...

42
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:04,604
I want you to sit with Chloe.

43
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,269
I've got to be up there, and it's a
little tricky with Alex's folks.

44
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,809
I understand.

45
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,323
Who's Chloe?

46
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,907
It's Alex's girlfriend.

47
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,626
I'll take care of her.

48
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,961
Chloe, this is Michael.

49
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:34,459
This is Chloe.

50
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,726
Do you want to sit up with us?

51
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:55,073
I'm going to sit here by
myself for a while, okay?

52
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:29,233
Sometimes...

53
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,528
it is hard for us to believe...

54
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:34,779
that the good Lord had a plan.

55
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,314
This is one of those times.

56
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:42,822
I didn't know Alex
Marshall personally.

57
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:46,207
But after speaking
with his loved ones...

58
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,452
I feel that I do.

59
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:54,672
A brilliant physics student at
the University of Michigan...

60
00:08:55,227 --> 00:09:00,219
who paradoxically chose to
turn his back on science...

61
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,382
and taste of life
through a seemingly...

62
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:06,728
random series of occupations.

63
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:31,784
When a man like Alex...

64
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,796
chooses to leave us, there is
something wrong in this world.

65
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:37,960
I'm a pallbearer.

66
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,755
This is not Alex.

67
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:47,141
This is the empty
shell of his body.

68
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,770
Alex is spirit now.

69
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:56,728
But why are we left with this?

70
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,358
It makes me angry.

71
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:03,661
And I don't know what
to do with my anger.

72
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,662
Are not the satisfactions
of being a good man...

73
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,791
among our common men...

74
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:15,129
great enough to sustain us anymore?

75
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:20,459
Where did Alex's hope go?

76
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:25,016
Maybe that is the
small resolution...

77
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,936
we can take from here today.

78
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:31,147
To try to...

79
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,855
regain that hope...

80
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,022
that must have eluded Alex.

81
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:15,766
I did know Alex.

82
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:23,072
And I loved him.

83
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:32,996
See here today all those
people that Alex loved.

84
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:41,129
Not all of us have been able to see
each other much these last years.

85
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:46,886
But neither time nor distance...

86
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:50,556
could break the bonds that we feel.

87
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:57,893
Alex drew us together
from the beginning.

88
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:01,399
Now he brings us together again.

89
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,443
I don't know...

90
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,868
why this happened.

91
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,450
But I do know...

92
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,204
that there was always
something about Alex...

93
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,211
that was too good for this world.

94
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:33,222
I only hope...

95
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:37,931
that wherever he is now...

96
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:53,495
Burial...

97
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:57,326
will be at Westglade Memorial Park.

98
00:12:57,886 --> 00:12:59,664
There will be a reception...

99
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:03,540
at the home of Harold
and Sarah Cooper...

100
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,840
immediately following.

101
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:08,589
And now...

102
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:14,059
Karen Bowles, an old
college friend of Alex's...

103
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:18,350
will play one of
Alex's favourite songs.

104
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,076
Nicholas, this is Richard.

105
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,039
Pleasure to meet you.

106
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:02,080
I just met Meg earlier.
Just before the...

107
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,830
Can I go over there?

108
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,423
Sam Weber, this is Richard.

109
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:12,170
Really enjoy your TV show.
My boys and I watch it all the time.

110
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:16,547
Thank you. Well, we'll
see you out there.

111
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,248
What is this?

112
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:26,083
It's pretty strong stuff.

113
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:30,881
I feel terrible.

114
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:36,921
Last time I spoke with
Alex, we had a fight.

115
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:39,551
I yelled at him.

116
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:43,389
That's probably why
he killed himself.

117
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:54,146
What was the argument about?

118
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,780
I told him he was wasting his life.

119
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,258
You all right?

120
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:20,803
Yeah.

121
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:24,800
I'm a little disappointed, though.
I wanted to ride up there.

122
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:30,441
I've always wanted
to ride in a limo.

123
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:37,357
I do half my work in limos.

124
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,276
Are you a chauffeur?

125
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:41,275
No, a journalist.

126
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,741
<i>I write for People magazine.</i>

127
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:51,249
I can't believe you're still
mad about that thing.

128
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:53,171
This isn't the time. Just drop it.

129
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:58,210
I will if you will. Today most of all
we should remember we're friends.

130
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,261
And you're an actor?

131
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,770
Nothing like you described.
Not at all.

132
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,399
Not one of those people looks
like I thought they would.

133
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:25,487
I can't believe these are the people
you've talked about all these years.

134
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:30,499
I'd love to hear the way
you describe me to them.

135
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:56,412
Amazing tradition. They throw you a
party on the one day you can't come.

136
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,545
So how long were they together?

137
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,299
Four months.

138
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,180
Can't believe it.

139
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:16,305
His funeral and she's stoned.

140
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,523
Karen and I are staying here tonight.
We fly back to Detroit in the morning.

141
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:24,778
Are you staying?

142
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,240
I have to fly out
to Dallas tonight.

143
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:30,614
I'm interviewing a 14-year-old
blind baton twirler.

144
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,492
Where do you get those stories?

145
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:39,417
It's just good
investigative journalism.

146
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:41,210
- How's your life?
- Great.

147
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:43,044
- Yours?
- Not so great.

148
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,256
We're telling the truth.

149
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:48,346
You heard about my divorce.

150
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,300
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

151
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:52,685
Are you J.T. Lancer?

152
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,511
No, no, that's the
character I play.

153
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:56,852
I'm Sam Weber.

154
00:20:57,157 --> 00:21:00,311
Can I have your autograph,
whoever you are?

155
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:03,186
You think it's time we should
be thinking about Alex?

156
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:04,478
I'll give you a buck.

157
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:06,566
Okay, you're on.

158
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:15,953
You'd never get a crowd
this big at my funeral.

159
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:19,911
Come on. I'll come,
and I'll bring a date.

160
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,753
I know this is hard for you,
but it's all beautiful.

161
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:28,511
We put on a great funeral here.

162
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:30,258
Maybe I'll have mine here too.

163
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:34,015
We give first preference to people
who kill themselves in our bathroom.

164
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:40,145
That was a terrible thing to say.

165
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:43,067
I don't know why I said that.

166
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:48,063
That's why I don't smoke anymore.
Dope makes me stupid.

167
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,819
You talking about me?

168
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:52,444
Here's the guy who did this to me.

169
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:54,988
I no longer know how to
handle myself stoned.

170
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,870
You don't have to handle
yourself with us.

171
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:01,002
Will you marry me?

172
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,799
Both of you?

173
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:12,682
That shit they got about your
marriage wasn't from me.

174
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:15,568
I didn't know they were doing a
story, or why you don't believe me.

175
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,429
- Let's drop it!
- Say you believe me.

176
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:19,764
I believe you.
I always believe you.

177
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:23,730
Honest to God, I know it's crap.
That's why I'm getting out.

178
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:26,435
Yeah? What're you going to do?

179
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,815
I'm opening a club.

180
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,444
No shit!

181
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:34,159
Like Elaine's, but hipper.
Elaine's is dead.

182
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:38,327
You got the money?

183
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,990
Almost, almost.

184
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:42,289
Well, let me know.

185
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:43,744
What do you mean?

186
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,881
I might be interested.

187
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:49,172
Really?

188
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:53,970
So you and Alex were staying here?

189
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:56,258
We have a room downstairs.

190
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:57,674
Well, we did.

191
00:22:57,736 --> 00:22:59,181
I do.

192
00:23:00,364 --> 00:23:02,106
I found him.

193
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:03,774
God, it must have been awful.

194
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:06,274
It was. It was a real mess.

195
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,565
What will you do now?

196
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:10,526
We cleaned it up.

197
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:16,078
Are you going to stay here?

198
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:18,245
Yeah, till Sarah kicks me out.

199
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:20,871
I'm sure she'd never do that.

200
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:27,001
That's right, if I may.
That's why I'm calling, Jim.

201
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:31,089
That way, I can have a piece for
you this week and next week...

202
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:34,091
Give me a break.
I'll fly to Dallas on Monday.

203
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:36,921
She won't regain her
eyesight over the weekend.

204
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:40,262
I know, but I think I've got
something good right here.

205
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,555
I don't know. It's
about everything.

206
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:45,430
Suicide, despair, where
did our hope go...

207
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,981
Lost hope. That's it, lost hope.

208
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:50,904
You think everything's boring.

209
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:54,448
You wouldn't say that if it
was the "Lost Hope Diet."

210
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:00,700
Michael's office called.

211
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:02,997
He doesn't have to be
in Dallas till Monday.

212
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:04,669
He asked to stay the weekend.

213
00:24:04,762 --> 00:24:07,120
Harold, you didn't.

214
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:10,298
What could I say? He knows
that Sam is staying...

215
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,377
and Karen, Richard and Meg.

216
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:14,469
Meg's not staying.

217
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:17,345
Well, actually...

218
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:21,639
Where will we put them?

219
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,112
We'll make room.

220
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,689
Hi, guys.

221
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:29,652
- Hey, Nick.
- How you doing?

222
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,394
Good.

223
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:35,115
Advertising's all right.

224
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:38,243
A lot of bullshit with
clients and stuff.

225
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:40,121
But it's all right.

226
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:42,199
It's a decent living.

227
00:24:42,508 --> 00:24:45,543
Not as much as we spend, of course.

228
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:48,837
Just kidding. It's exactly
as much as we spend.

229
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:53,466
What have you got, an oil leak?
Can I give you a hand?

230
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:01,183
I think I got it.

231
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:08,190
I feel like I have never
been alone in my own house.

232
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:13,272
Never. Either Richard is there,
or the boys or the housekeeper.

233
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:16,489
Remember those lab rats who went
crazy when deprived of privacy?

234
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,693
They're living with you too?

235
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:22,195
- Should we push the beds together?
- Why?

236
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:24,744
Okay. How about further apart?

237
00:25:25,676 --> 00:25:28,793
In January we open in Greensboro.

238
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:32,130
And in April, our second
store in Charleston.

239
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:34,002
How many is that now?

240
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:36,424
Twenty-seven and twenty-eight.

241
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,221
Better watch out. Some big
monster will buy you.

242
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:42,051
We've had offers.

243
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,474
Who would've thought we'd
both make so much bread?

244
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:49,600
Two revolutionaries.

245
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:54,352
Good thing it's not
important to us.

246
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:59,981
Fuck them if they
can't take a joke.

247
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:07,490
Chloe. Hi, you there?

248
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:14,422
I just wanted to...

249
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:16,671
make sure you're okay.

250
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:19,008
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good.

251
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,550
Thanks, Michael.

252
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:35,869
Come along?

253
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:37,590
Are you kidding?

254
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:24,173
So I'm in the Philadelphia
Public Defender's office.

255
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:28,048
<i>My clients were the scum of
the earth. Extreme repulsivos.</i>

256
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,717
One of them got
caught in the house.

257
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,430
He and his friends beat up the
husband, rape the wife...

258
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:37,517
then tried to blow the place up.
When I ask what happened, he says:

259
00:28:37,576 --> 00:28:39,056
"I was in Montreal at the time."

260
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,653
Who'd you think your clients would be?
Grumpy and Sneezy?

261
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:44,739
Huey and Bobby.

262
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:47,443
I don't know. I just
didn't think they'd be...

263
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:48,824
so guilty.

264
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:52,279
And then?

265
00:28:52,674 --> 00:28:53,954
Then I left.

266
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:58,159
A law school friend is at a firm
in Atlanta doing real estate law.

267
00:28:58,263 --> 00:28:59,708
I went to see them.

268
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,249
The offices were very clean...

269
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:04,549
and the clients were
only raping the land...

270
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:07,680
and then of course
there was the money.

271
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,591
<i>El greedo strikes again.</i>

272
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:12,090
Sarah has that robe.

273
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:14,221
Not this weekend she doesn't.

274
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,472
I always jump her
when she wears it.

275
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:18,890
Harold, don't you
have any other music?

276
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:20,147
Like, from this century?

277
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:22,193
There is no other
music in my house.

278
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:25,731
There's been a lot of terrific
music in the last 10 years.

279
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:26,940
Like what?

280
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,447
How about you, Michael?
Tell us about bigtime journalism.

281
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:35,155
Where I work we have
only one editorial rule:

282
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:39,284
No writing longer than an average
person can read during an average crap.

283
00:29:40,931 --> 00:29:43,088
I'm tired of having my
work read in the can.

284
00:29:43,142 --> 00:29:45,215
People read Dostoyevsky in the can.

285
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:47,046
But they can't finish it.

286
00:29:48,897 --> 00:29:51,671
This certainly is a familiar scene.

287
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:56,050
I'm feeling very guilty about it.

288
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:59,309
I'm happy to be here, but
I'm sick about the reason.

289
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:01,692
I'm going to bed.

290
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:04,454
I'm sorry. We could talk
about something else.

291
00:30:04,455 --> 00:30:07,525
That's okay. I'm exhausted.
Good night, everyone.

292
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:09,153
I'll be up in a minute.

293
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:10,868
Good night, Sarah.

294
00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:13,652
Harold, I'm sorry.

295
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:16,495
We all feel that way.

296
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:19,750
I forget what this is like.

297
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:22,622
In L.A., I don't know who to trust.

298
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:25,248
I feel like everybody
wants something from me.

299
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,377
I know that sounds
terrible, but it's true.

300
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:30,423
Tell me about it.
It's a cold world out there.

301
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:33,432
Sometimes I think I'm
getting frosty myself.

302
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:36,099
I don't know what
people think about me.

303
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:39,846
I don't know why they like me,
or even if they do like me.

304
00:30:40,449 --> 00:30:42,558
You don't have that problem here.

305
00:30:45,496 --> 00:30:46,976
You know I don't like you.

306
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:50,153
Me either.

307
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:51,815
Ditto.

308
00:30:51,877 --> 00:30:53,619
So relax.

309
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:57,330
Assholes.

310
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,818
I was just coming down.

311
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:27,184
Don't.

312
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,327
What are we doing?

313
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:44,367
I didn't get to talk to you before.
You got me stoned too quick.

314
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:46,165
But I'm okay now.

315
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:48,541
I'm just drunk and therefore brave.

316
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,801
I've always been a
cowardly drunk myself.

317
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:55,178
I bought the land three years ago.

318
00:31:55,232 --> 00:32:00,141
He and Chloe were working on it. There's
an old house they were fixing up.

319
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:04,312
It's really pretty. I can take you
out there tomorrow if you want.

320
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:09,274
That's what I don't get. It's
one of the things I don't get.

321
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,771
He was really involved in that.

322
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:14,108
It seemed to really
mean something to him.

323
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:18,496
I went with him three weeks
ago to buy a table saw.

324
00:32:19,423 --> 00:32:21,580
Why does he do a thing like that?

325
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,537
I should've known.

326
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,503
- How could you know?
- Nobody knew.

327
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:31,046
I can't even believe it now.

328
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:33,508
I don't care. I should've known.

329
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:37,297
All I want is a little warmth.

330
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:44,970
What?

331
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:51,648
Sweetheart?

332
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:02,705
Did I ever tell you...

333
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:05,623
what happened to me in Vietnam?

334
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:20,719
It's a fucking bat, and I
think it touched my hair!

335
00:33:20,818 --> 00:33:23,094
I hate them! They're
like rats with wings.

336
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:24,729
No, pigeons are rats with wings.

337
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,313
- They're harmless. They eat mosquitoes.
- I'm going to wash my hair and puke.

338
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,939
- Puke first, of course.
- Stand aside!

339
00:33:33,997 --> 00:33:36,273
That's cashmere! Give me that.

340
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:42,490
I'll be right bat.

341
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:48,789
Where'd it go?

342
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:52,961
Listen for it.

343
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:55,875
It makes weird sound. Kind of:

344
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:02,391
It's quiet in here.

345
00:34:04,236 --> 00:34:05,895
It's too quiet.

346
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:11,807
Shit!

347
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:13,392
Look out, Nick!

348
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,188
Behind you. Here, let me open this.

349
00:34:17,249 --> 00:34:18,564
Maybe it'll split.

350
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:22,573
All right!

351
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:26,531
Okay, now we got a fair fight.

352
00:34:49,573 --> 00:34:52,560
<i>Keep your mouth shut.
I'll do the talking.</i>

353
00:34:52,618 --> 00:34:54,691
<i>You can't go in there.</i>

354
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:58,657
<i>I told you never to walk
in here without knocking.</i>

355
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:00,070
What's this?

356
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,356
I'm not sure.

357
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,823
What's it about?

358
00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:04,495
I don't know.

359
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,207
Who's that?

360
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:15,875
I think the guy in the hat
did something terrible.

361
00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:21,168
<i>- Who wants to be next?
- Like what?</i>

362
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:23,881
You're so analytical.

363
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:27,014
Sometimes you just
have to let art...

364
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:28,853
flow over you.

365
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:34,358
I'm hungry. I had this
really dirty dream.

366
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:36,276
Was it about Karen?

367
00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:39,695
- Why do you say that?
- Why should anything have changed?

368
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,115
You're the one she always wanted.

369
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:46,359
In the old days, I wasn't emotionally
equipped to satisfy her.

370
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:48,947
Now the equipment
doesn't work at all.

371
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:53,081
Why do we have to talk about that?

372
00:35:54,513 --> 00:35:56,622
Come on in the kitchen with me.

373
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:05,389
I think she found what she
was looking for in Richard.

374
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:09,341
Be careful what you
want, young lady...

375
00:36:09,778 --> 00:36:12,101
or you will surely get it.

376
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:21,029
What're you doing up?
Why didn't you come in?

377
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:22,721
I didn't realize
anybody else was up.

378
00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:27,069
I've been thinking about
your friend Alex.

379
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:29,162
Did you ever meet him?

380
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,908
Karen's told me some.
I'm imagining mostly.

381
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:36,670
I never sleep through the night.
Insomnia. Karen doesn't know.

382
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:39,792
I might have something
that can help.

383
00:36:40,934 --> 00:36:42,332
No, thanks.

384
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:44,256
I don't mind it.

385
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:49,590
Sometimes when my family's asleep,
I sit downstairs and it's so quiet.

386
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:53,476
I hate not being able to sleep,
but I don't mind the time alone.

387
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,351
Sometimes I think the thing about
kids is their instant priorities.

388
00:36:59,411 --> 00:37:02,529
You know you must protect
and provide for them...

389
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:07,117
and sometimes it means your life
isn't exactly how you want it to be.

390
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:10,830
There's some...

391
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:13,999
asshole at work you
have to kowtow to...

392
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:18,586
and sometimes you do things
you never thought you'd do.

393
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:21,627
But you try to
minimize that stuff...

394
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:24,209
and be the best person you can be.

395
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:30,468
But you set your priorities.
And that's the way life is.

396
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:33,385
I wonder if your
friend Alex knew that.

397
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:37,557
One thing's for sure:
he couldn't live with it.

398
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:44,028
I know I shouldn't talk.
You guys knew him.

399
00:37:44,623 --> 00:37:46,483
But the thing is...

400
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:50,077
nobody said it was going to be fun.

401
00:37:51,547 --> 00:37:53,823
At least nobody said it to me.

402
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:11,550
You can't run in those shoes.
I'll get you some good shoes.

403
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:18,846
I'm about to tell you something
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

404
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,192
Then maybe you shouldn't.

405
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:24,361
I already told Alex.

406
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:26,564
Look what happened to him.

407
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:36,325
In a few months, a very
large corporation...

408
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:40,533
a conglomerate, is going to
buy my very small company.

409
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:44,705
Anyone who has our stock
will triple their money.

410
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:50,131
That's how Alex could
afford to buy the land.

411
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:55,100
I was thinking you could
use the information...

412
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:57,428
to get into another line of work.

413
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,019
You never learn, do you?

414
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:05,485
By telling you, I've violated
about 16 regulations...

415
00:39:05,496 --> 00:39:07,819
of the Securities
Exchange Commission.

416
00:39:07,873 --> 00:39:09,982
So please don't repeat it.

417
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:11,617
Repeat what?

418
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:21,042
I loved Alex.

419
00:39:23,722 --> 00:39:26,211
What happened between
him and Sarah...

420
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:28,506
hurt, I can't deny that.

421
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:31,212
But that was five years ago.

422
00:39:32,022 --> 00:39:33,551
We all got over it.

423
00:39:36,193 --> 00:39:38,718
I think they felt as bad as I did.

424
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:43,941
You know...

425
00:39:45,703 --> 00:39:48,738
they only slept
together a few times.

426
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:55,192
But in a way, their affair had
been going on since Ann Arbor.

427
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:58,786
She didn't marry Alex.

428
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:07,501
You'll explain everything?

429
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,175
I'll explain to them.

430
00:40:09,393 --> 00:40:11,253
Have a safe trip.

431
00:40:29,288 --> 00:40:33,355
That's the trouble with these. You
must watch them every minute.

432
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:41,915
Did I miss Karen and Richard?

433
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:43,365
Nope.

434
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:46,290
Just Richard. Karen's
staying the weekend.

435
00:40:46,388 --> 00:40:47,619
But not Richard?

436
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,040
Went back to be with the kids.

437
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,170
That's interesting.

438
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:56,088
How did Richard feel about it?

439
00:40:56,607 --> 00:41:00,674
If you sleep this late, you'll
miss a few mini-dramas.

440
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:04,014
I just hope you'll wake
me for anything ugly.

441
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:10,518
How do actors learn all those lines?
How do you remember them?

442
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:13,946
My wife used to run them with
me, but now my maid does.

443
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,648
- Your maid?
- That's how she learned English.

444
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,326
Sarah says to make three
of those milks nonfat.

445
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:21,998
Sure you don't mind this?

446
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:24,918
I'll never remember that. Will you?

447
00:41:25,094 --> 00:41:26,574
I don't know.

448
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:30,120
If we'd gotten married,
we'd go shopping like this.

449
00:41:30,307 --> 00:41:34,090
No, if we'd gotten married,
I'd be doing this alone.

450
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:40,964
No, I did not say that, Molly.
I said we'll see.

451
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:45,558
I don't have to explain
it, young lady.

452
00:41:47,032 --> 00:41:51,182
I want you to do it because
I said so. Understand?

453
00:41:55,124 --> 00:41:57,862
When you're a mother
you can be mean.

454
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:04,406
All right, you can do that.
Tell Carmelina I said it's okay.

455
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:07,876
I love you, sweetheart.
Daddy will call you later.

456
00:42:09,138 --> 00:42:12,255
Sometimes I don't believe
what I hear myself saying.

457
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:30,058
<i>So you came back from Vietnam...</i>

458
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,684
<i>a changed man.</i>

459
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,237
<i>Well, why don't you
just tell everybody?</i>

460
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,489
<i>Then, in 1972...</i>

461
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:40,900
<i>you returned to the
University of Michigan...</i>

462
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:43,195
<i>to enter the doctoral
program in psychology.</i>

463
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:47,287
<i>But you couldn't seem to
finish that dissertation.</i>

464
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:52,045
<i>I could have. I chose not to.</i>

465
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:55,382
<i>I'm not hung up on
this completion thing.</i>

466
00:42:55,434 --> 00:42:58,386
<i>Then you had many jobs,
all of which you quit.</i>

467
00:42:58,437 --> 00:43:02,220
<i>What are you getting at?
I was evolving.</i>

468
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:04,597
I'm still evolving.

469
00:43:05,736 --> 00:43:09,020
But your real fame came as
a radio psychologist...

470
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:11,479
on KSFO in San Francisco.

471
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:15,858
I wouldn't call it fame exactly.
I had a small...

472
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:18,319
deeply disturbed following.

473
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,033
What are you doing...

474
00:43:21,877 --> 00:43:23,026
now?

475
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:27,367
Or I should say, what have
you evolved into now?

476
00:43:29,968 --> 00:43:32,126
Oh, I'm in sales.

477
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:34,331
What are you selling?

478
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:38,049
I don't have to answer that.

479
00:43:39,311 --> 00:43:40,922
We're leaving. Have you seen Chloe?

480
00:43:40,979 --> 00:43:43,172
We're on the air here.

481
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,881
Sorry.

482
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:49,180
Sorry, pal. Got to go.

483
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:50,980
Just answer that last question.

484
00:43:50,989 --> 00:43:53,396
I said, "I've got to go."

485
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:08,214
So what happened to your partner?

486
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:10,704
He wasn't my partner.
He had the idea for the club.

487
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:13,788
He's out of it now.
We weren't conducive.

488
00:44:13,846 --> 00:44:17,379
We got together and hypered
each other into a frenzy.

489
00:44:17,808 --> 00:44:20,499
His wife left for a younger
woman, he couldn't make love.

490
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:23,845
He was hospitalized for
being such a nerd.

491
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:27,141
So he's out of it?

492
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:30,642
Yeah, he's out. It's just
me, looking for investors.

493
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:35,724
Alex and I made love the night
before he died. It was fantastic.

494
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:41,773
He went out with a
bang, not a whimper.

495
00:44:45,002 --> 00:44:47,278
They're either married or gay.

496
00:44:47,337 --> 00:44:50,906
If they're not gay, they've broken
up with the most wonderful woman...

497
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:54,701
or they've broken up with
a bitch who looks like me.

498
00:44:55,137 --> 00:44:59,500
They're in transition from a monogamous
relationship and need space.

499
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,836
Or they're tired of
space, but can't commit.

500
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:05,544
Or they want to commit but
are afraid to get close.

501
00:45:05,647 --> 00:45:08,884
They want to get close and
you don't want them near.

502
00:45:08,984 --> 00:45:10,762
Can't be that bad.

503
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:12,306
You don't know.

504
00:45:12,696 --> 00:45:15,814
I've been out there
dating for 20 years.

505
00:45:15,866 --> 00:45:19,684
I know in the first 15 seconds
if there's a chance in the world.

506
00:45:19,745 --> 00:45:21,819
At least you're giving
them a fair shot.

507
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:25,488
Easy for you to say. Married
to Harold, the perfect man.

508
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,743
Sometimes I think I don't
want a man anymore.

509
00:45:29,797 --> 00:45:32,914
So here I sit on my
ticking biological clock.

510
00:45:32,966 --> 00:45:38,291
The only thing I've known my entire
life is that I want to have a child.

511
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:42,964
Don't remind me. It was the
right thing to do at the time.

512
00:45:43,102 --> 00:45:45,175
So what do you do?

513
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:50,593
I'm going to have a baby.

514
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:53,717
What?

515
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,490
She was young when
Robin and I divorced.

516
00:46:13,757 --> 00:46:16,033
Now she has a new father.

517
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:22,288
Sometimes I think it's confusing
to her when I'm around.

518
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:24,175
I don't know.

519
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:33,757
- I don't need it.
- God knows I don't.

520
00:46:38,449 --> 00:46:42,100
- We should think of the others.
- Don't want to be selfish.

521
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:47,697
I know Sarah and Meg would want
some of this Fudge Royale.

522
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,408
They have no self-control.

523
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:51,908
And the Cherry Nugget too, I think.

524
00:46:58,677 --> 00:47:00,455
I don't know.

525
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:03,371
Maybe I don't want to
give her the time.

526
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:06,922
Could I be that big an asshole?

527
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:12,547
That's what's great about the
outdoors: It's one giant toilet.

528
00:47:12,649 --> 00:47:15,685
Maybe you should put a spot
like this in your club.

529
00:47:15,778 --> 00:47:17,970
It will be big. You should
take it more seriously.

530
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,269
You'd have your own table
waiting at all times.

531
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:24,646
I'm considering it. I've
always wanted my own table.

532
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,770
Now, I'd have a chair too, right?

533
00:47:30,459 --> 00:47:34,028
Remember senior year we were all going
to buy that land near Saginaw?

534
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:35,912
What happened with that?

535
00:47:36,006 --> 00:47:37,998
We didn't have any money.

536
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:41,958
That's when property was a crime.

537
00:47:44,056 --> 00:47:46,545
You know, it's raining.

538
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,425
It's nice, isn't it?

539
00:47:48,894 --> 00:47:50,292
Nice.

540
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:53,005
You're not afraid
of snakes, are you?

541
00:47:54,525 --> 00:47:56,551
You're a doctor. Doctors
know everything.

542
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,637
Be supportive for a
minute and shut up.

543
00:47:58,737 --> 00:48:02,805
I've been taking my temperature
and I know I'm ovulating.

544
00:48:02,866 --> 00:48:05,818
The ground is ready. I need
someone to plant the seed.

545
00:48:05,911 --> 00:48:08,567
Who's going to be the lucky farmer?

546
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:12,904
These are the best guys I know.
My favourite men in the world.

547
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:16,985
Unfortunately, I found out
Nick is no longer a candidate.

548
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:21,038
Michael's a possibility, but I
think as a fallback position.

549
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:22,497
So to speak.

550
00:48:22,594 --> 00:48:24,372
So that leaves Sam.

551
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:28,005
- Harold's not good enough for you?
- Are you kidding? I'd love it.

552
00:48:28,058 --> 00:48:29,918
But I couldn't ask that of you.

553
00:48:30,018 --> 00:48:31,962
Anyway, Harold's got enough kids.

554
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,174
That's very considerate.
Too bad Richard left.

555
00:48:37,735 --> 00:48:42,395
Have you and Sam discussed it, or
are you planning a surprise attack?

556
00:48:42,448 --> 00:48:44,391
Why should he have
a problem with it?

557
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,604
There won't be obligations.
I love him as a friend.

558
00:48:47,661 --> 00:48:50,732
I assume he loves me.
He'd do anything for me.

559
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:54,281
Somehow I feel it isn't
quite this simple.

560
00:48:54,418 --> 00:48:57,323
For one thing, it doesn't
always happen the first time.

561
00:48:57,421 --> 00:49:00,373
That's not what they
told us in high school.

562
00:49:00,674 --> 00:49:04,658
This is great. This
is really great.

563
00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:15,803
Alex loved this place.

564
00:49:17,816 --> 00:49:21,468
I can understand it. It's terrific.

565
00:49:32,498 --> 00:49:34,322
You remind me of Alex.

566
00:49:42,591 --> 00:49:44,166
I ain't him.

567
00:49:45,177 --> 00:49:47,286
<i>Nobody thinks they're a bad person.</i>

568
00:49:47,388 --> 00:49:50,209
<i>I don't claim people think
they do the right thing.</i>

569
00:49:50,265 --> 00:49:53,716
<i>They may know they do dishonest
or manipulative things...</i>

570
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:55,796
<i>but think there's a
good reason for it.</i>

571
00:49:56,355 --> 00:49:59,010
<i>They think it'll turn
out for the best.</i>

572
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:03,133
<i>If it turns out best for them,
it is by definition what's best.</i>

573
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:06,106
<i>You also come up against
a question of style.</i>

574
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:09,263
<i>My style may be too direct.</i>

575
00:50:09,368 --> 00:50:12,522
<i>Perhaps given my style
I seem more nakedly...</i>

576
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:15,449
<i>opportunistic or jerky or...</i>

577
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:17,820
<i>What was the other thing?</i>

578
00:50:17,876 --> 00:50:19,405
<i>- Manipulative?
- Whatever.</i>

579
00:50:19,461 --> 00:50:22,117
<i>All that's happening is I'm
trying to get what I want.</i>

580
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:25,207
<i>Which is what we all do, but
their styles are so warm...</i>

581
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:28,792
<i>you don't realize they're
trying to get what they want.</i>

582
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:32,207
<i>So my transparent efforts are
more honest and admirable.</i>

583
00:50:32,307 --> 00:50:35,544
<i>Why does this sound like a
massive rationalization?</i>

584
00:50:35,644 --> 00:50:38,335
<i>Don't knock rationalization.
Where would we be without it?</i>

585
00:50:38,397 --> 00:50:41,717
<i>I don't know anyone who can go a day
without 2 or 3 rationalizations.</i>

586
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:43,345
<i>They're more important than sex.</i>

587
00:50:43,402 --> 00:50:45,559
<i>Nothing's more important than sex!</i>

588
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:48,392
<i>Ever gone a week without
a rationalization?</i>

589
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:51,187
What's your shoe size?

590
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:53,193
Six and a half.

591
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:57,151
Still the best way to
determine if it's ready.

592
00:50:57,666 --> 00:50:59,834
- Meg, what's your shoe size?
- Who wants to know?

593
00:50:59,835 --> 00:51:01,066
What, it's about a six and a half?

594
00:51:01,128 --> 00:51:03,404
It used to be, but now it's seven.

595
00:51:03,505 --> 00:51:05,965
- Your feet grow as you get older.
- I wish everything did.

596
00:51:05,966 --> 00:51:08,408
How much longer?
Everything's getting cold.

597
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,497
After 12 years you haven't
learned to make anything else?

598
00:51:11,555 --> 00:51:14,044
- I've improved on it.
- Now it's edible?

599
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:17,792
- The meal is ready. Let's go.
- J.T. Lancer!

600
00:51:17,853 --> 00:51:21,054
Let's go watch this
incredible show!

601
00:51:21,106 --> 00:51:22,587
Oh, my God!

602
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:25,725
Come on, Sam.

603
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:28,604
Jesus.

604
00:51:31,366 --> 00:51:34,437
Look at that hunk of man, kids.

605
00:51:34,912 --> 00:51:36,939
He's so handsome.

606
00:51:36,997 --> 00:51:38,442
Jesus!

607
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:41,822
Look out!

608
00:51:42,503 --> 00:51:44,161
You forgot your Dramamine.

609
00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:48,366
- Turn that off.
- No, it's great!

610
00:51:48,425 --> 00:51:50,084
Does the suit come
with the machete?

611
00:51:50,094 --> 00:51:52,002
You're dashing. Dashing!

612
00:51:52,513 --> 00:51:54,705
Why are you doing this to me?

613
00:51:54,723 --> 00:51:56,299
You look great!

614
00:51:57,601 --> 00:51:59,082
There she is.

615
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:01,842
I interviewed this girl.

616
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:03,840
Where is this?
I'm going to Hollywood.

617
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:06,467
"I want a Margarita now!"

618
00:52:10,197 --> 00:52:12,639
Kids, don't try that at home.
That's a warning.

619
00:52:12,783 --> 00:52:14,774
Watch out for that stick shift!

620
00:52:15,744 --> 00:52:17,853
- Two at once?
- He's done a lot of pec work.

621
00:52:18,163 --> 00:52:20,155
My favourite part!

622
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:23,070
Here it is.

623
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,953
- Say, baby, let's eat.
- Come on, big guy!

624
00:52:30,008 --> 00:52:33,328
- The pasta's ruined now.
- You get money when that airs?

625
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:38,084
One thing I do want is a Cosmic
Invaders game for my trailer...

626
00:52:38,142 --> 00:52:40,059
so Nick and I can
watch it and kick back.

627
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,467
- What? I don't want to hear this.
- What do you mean?

628
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:45,675
Video games? You relax
with video games?

629
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:48,515
Don't knock video games.

630
00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:54,014
I let you guys out of sight and
you develop moronic interests.

631
00:52:54,116 --> 00:52:55,514
Don't knock morons.

632
00:52:57,369 --> 00:53:00,191
Would you prefer we
got into heavy drugs?

633
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:01,520
That might be better.

634
00:53:01,623 --> 00:53:03,531
No offense, Nick.

635
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:07,492
He should be here.

636
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,034
I feel like we should've
had a chair for Alex.

637
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:15,002
Of course, we don't
have enough food.

638
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:18,337
This is all so familiar.

639
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:21,835
I love you all so much. That
sounds gross, doesn't it?

640
00:53:21,894 --> 00:53:23,967
No, it doesn't.

641
00:53:24,563 --> 00:53:28,346
I feel I was at my best
when I was with you people.

642
00:53:33,155 --> 00:53:35,015
I know what you mean.

643
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:39,818
When I lost touch
with this group...

644
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,527
I lost my idea of what I should be.

645
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:46,446
Maybe that's what happened to Alex.

646
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:49,406
We expected something of each
other then. We needed that.

647
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:50,742
Not me.

648
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:53,791
Getting away from you people was the
best thing to ever happen to me.

649
00:53:53,842 --> 00:53:57,957
I mean, how much sex, fun,
friendship can one man take?

650
00:53:58,013 --> 00:54:00,122
Had to get out in the
world, get dirty.

651
00:54:00,224 --> 00:54:01,834
No, I think Sam is right.

652
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:04,001
There was something in me then...

653
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:06,623
that made me want to go to
Harlem and teach ghetto kids.

654
00:54:06,688 --> 00:54:10,589
I was going to help the scum, as I
so compassionately call them now.

655
00:54:10,901 --> 00:54:12,299
Some of them are scum.

656
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:14,435
Some of us are scum.

657
00:54:14,863 --> 00:54:19,441
So what's the thrust here?
We were great then and we're shit now?

658
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,188
I don't buy that.

659
00:54:21,245 --> 00:54:23,852
That's not what we're saying.

660
00:54:24,456 --> 00:54:25,901
I don't know.

661
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:28,775
I'd hate to think
it was all just...

662
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:30,281
fashion.

663
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,361
What?

664
00:54:32,423 --> 00:54:33,821
Our commitment.

665
00:54:33,924 --> 00:54:36,117
It wasn't. We accomplished things.

666
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:39,419
- All evidence to the contrary.
- You're just taking a position.

667
00:54:39,471 --> 00:54:42,672
Sometimes I think I've
put that time down...

668
00:54:42,683 --> 00:54:45,456
just so I can live
with how I am now.

669
00:54:46,145 --> 00:54:48,586
Help me with these bleeding hearts.

670
00:54:49,064 --> 00:54:51,091
I know what Alex would say.

671
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,595
What?

672
00:54:54,236 --> 00:54:55,895
What's for dessert?

673
00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:09,363
I'm not cynical about dessert.

674
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,837
- Want to load the dishwasher?
- I'd be thrilled.

675
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,863
I think I've just been
too slow to realize...

676
00:56:32,918 --> 00:56:35,787
that people our age with
histories like ours...

677
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:38,410
having gone through
the same stuff...

678
00:56:38,507 --> 00:56:42,491
could be dishonest, unprincipled,
backstabbing sleazeballs.

679
00:56:42,594 --> 00:56:44,668
Could have told you
that a long time ago.

680
00:56:44,722 --> 00:56:48,789
I was prejudiced in their favour.
I thought because they look like us...

681
00:56:48,851 --> 00:56:51,506
and talked like us
they would think like us.

682
00:56:54,648 --> 00:56:59,177
I know that Richard will
always be faithful to me.

683
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:01,895
That's nice.

684
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,974
A little trust.

685
00:57:04,575 --> 00:57:06,483
Fear of herpes.

686
00:57:15,753 --> 00:57:17,744
It's not right.

687
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:21,163
Alex is still warm.

688
00:57:21,925 --> 00:57:23,999
Can't blame Chloe. She's a kid.

689
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:26,702
Michael hasn't changed.

690
00:57:27,848 --> 00:57:29,211
Wait.

691
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:30,497
What?

692
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,461
Ever meet Michael's
girlfriend, Annie?

693
00:57:35,564 --> 00:57:37,306
She's great.

694
00:57:37,357 --> 00:57:41,721
She teaches the fourth grade.
Still teaching in Harlem.

695
00:57:43,572 --> 00:57:45,266
It's not right.

696
00:57:49,036 --> 00:57:51,110
I can't keep my eyes open.

697
00:57:51,163 --> 00:57:53,569
I don't want to go
to bed, but I must.

698
00:57:53,624 --> 00:57:55,448
- You really don't want to?
- I must.

699
00:57:55,501 --> 00:57:57,159
But you don't...

700
00:57:58,587 --> 00:58:00,281
want to?

701
00:58:02,466 --> 00:58:04,457
Come with me.

702
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:12,581
What?

703
00:58:14,144 --> 00:58:15,922
You want me to what?

704
00:58:17,523 --> 00:58:20,724
Come on, Sam. Don't
make me say it again.

705
00:58:39,044 --> 00:58:41,735
You've given me a massive headache.

706
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:45,743
You're not going to use
that old excuse, are you?

707
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:48,954
You've got good genes.

708
00:58:59,064 --> 00:59:00,842
Where'd Chloe go?

709
00:59:00,899 --> 00:59:03,057
She's coming right back.

710
00:59:04,445 --> 00:59:06,684
No, I'm not in the mood.

711
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,103
Wait a minute. What
is that, a lude?

712
00:59:09,158 --> 00:59:10,768
You want it?

713
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:15,356
Do you take a half?

714
00:59:15,456 --> 00:59:17,648
Full stomach, I'd take a whole.

715
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:19,735
Right, I'm sure you would.

716
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,113
<i>What the hell. L'Chaim!</i>

717
00:59:36,393 --> 00:59:39,547
There's a shift in your
perceptions of the world.

718
00:59:39,605 --> 00:59:42,889
Forever you're responsible
for another living thing.

719
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:47,262
It's wonderful.

720
00:59:47,362 --> 00:59:49,769
But it's a huge commitment.

721
00:59:50,574 --> 00:59:52,352
A commitment that has
nothing to do...

722
00:59:52,368 --> 00:59:55,983
with legal names and
legal obligations.

723
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:00,865
I'm sorry, Meg.

724
01:00:01,043 --> 01:00:03,948
I'd love to help you but I can't.

725
01:00:04,004 --> 01:00:05,829
You know, you're something.

726
01:00:05,923 --> 01:00:07,914
I love you.

727
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:10,782
- Really, I can't.
- I accept that!

728
01:00:10,844 --> 01:00:14,994
I mean, I really love you.
You're a nice person.

729
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:18,755
Really?

730
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:26,677
So you want to fuck?

731
01:00:27,653 --> 01:00:29,395
Just kidding!

732
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:38,986
Then one day I was driving home.

733
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:42,151
They were running a tape
of one of my shows.

734
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:45,612
I heard myself talking to
someone who had called up.

735
01:00:45,671 --> 01:00:48,623
Someone in real pain.

736
01:00:48,841 --> 01:00:52,955
I listened for about 45 seconds.
And I'm talking...

737
01:00:53,053 --> 01:00:56,254
like I know them and understand...

738
01:00:56,306 --> 01:01:00,967
and have something useful
to say about their lives.

739
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:04,720
The worst part was
they believed me.

740
01:01:04,815 --> 01:01:06,806
I quit the next day.

741
01:01:16,618 --> 01:01:18,194
You helped me.

742
01:01:20,914 --> 01:01:24,199
I was 15 and my family
was living in Oakland.

743
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:27,571
And I used to listen
to you every night.

744
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:30,698
One night I called you up.

745
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:34,246
I was upset and thought
something was wrong with me.

746
01:01:34,344 --> 01:01:37,166
- Like I was a pervert.
- What did I say?

747
01:01:37,806 --> 01:01:40,165
That I'd be okay if I
did my homework...

748
01:01:40,225 --> 01:01:42,798
and went to bed at
a reasonable hour.

749
01:01:44,897 --> 01:01:47,635
You were right. It was okay.

750
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:49,095
You helped.

751
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:53,012
I don't want to discuss this now.

752
01:01:53,072 --> 01:01:56,272
Why? You have more people to
tell about the stock thing?

753
01:01:56,325 --> 01:01:58,149
It's really a charming side of you.

754
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,112
Remind me to get more
cocaine tomorrow.

755
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:05,692
If you tell everyone about the stock
deal, it will blow up in your face.

756
01:02:05,751 --> 01:02:07,778
Who will you tell next? Michael?

757
01:02:07,836 --> 01:02:11,370
He came down here to find investors
for that moronic club of his.

758
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:14,708
- He came down for Alex's funeral.
- Maybe.

759
01:02:16,178 --> 01:02:19,498
You are in no condition
to discuss this now.

760
01:02:19,807 --> 01:02:21,880
You can't change people's lives!

761
01:02:21,975 --> 01:02:25,758
Who do you think you are,
John Beresford Tipton?

762
01:02:26,355 --> 01:02:28,097
I'm going to sleep.

763
01:02:30,943 --> 01:02:34,097
How can you go to sleep?
I'm not even tired.

764
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:07,800
Some say suicide is the ultimate
act of self-absorption.

765
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:10,806
Alex didn't commit suicide.
It was an accident.

766
01:03:10,899 --> 01:03:14,883
That's right, he was shaving.
Alex had hairy wrists.

767
01:03:16,405 --> 01:03:19,060
Masturbation's the ultimate
act of self-absorption.

768
01:03:19,158 --> 01:03:20,935
You jerk off?

769
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:23,193
Does a bear have fleas?

770
01:03:23,245 --> 01:03:25,603
No, does a bear shit in the woods?

771
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:26,985
Does a bear jerk off?

772
01:03:27,082 --> 01:03:29,489
I shit in the woods,
but I can't jerk off.

773
01:03:29,585 --> 01:03:31,346
We're trying to avoid
dealing with Alex.

774
01:03:31,378 --> 01:03:33,618
Every time it comes up,
someone changes the subject.

775
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:35,538
It's a dead subject.

776
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:37,997
I get real tired of these jokes.

777
01:03:38,052 --> 01:03:40,956
What are we afraid of?
To show our emotions?

778
01:03:41,013 --> 01:03:43,336
Are we mad at him for
leaving no explanations?

779
01:03:43,432 --> 01:03:47,167
I could say something funny
about that. But I won't.

780
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:49,503
Great, they got here early.

781
01:03:55,444 --> 01:03:56,844
Thanks, Toby. I appreciate it.

782
01:03:56,904 --> 01:04:00,140
Yes, sir, Mr. Cooper.
It was my pleasure.

783
01:04:02,743 --> 01:04:05,979
Yes, sir, Mr. Cooper. Sir.

784
01:04:06,038 --> 01:04:08,480
Give me a break, that's my name.

785
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:10,449
Mr. Weber.

786
01:05:12,521 --> 01:05:14,678
So you just fell asleep?

787
01:05:14,773 --> 01:05:17,180
That's what I just said, didn't I?

788
01:05:17,276 --> 01:05:19,385
About five times.

789
01:05:19,903 --> 01:05:23,519
I didn't know him in the
biblical sense. Is that clear?

790
01:05:23,574 --> 01:05:25,019
I don't know why you're touchy.

791
01:05:25,075 --> 01:05:27,315
I don't know why you're curious.

792
01:05:30,456 --> 01:05:32,150
These feel great.

793
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:36,071
I'm never taking these off.
I will sleep in them.

794
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:39,205
Which doesn't mean he'll
have sex with them.

795
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:43,369
Is there any salt
and pepper, please?

796
01:05:55,022 --> 01:05:59,220
What do you think about this
latest brainstorm of Michael's?

797
01:06:02,446 --> 01:06:06,311
I'm not sure I want to be part
owner of a jet-set greasy spoon.

798
01:06:07,868 --> 01:06:10,476
Think we could stall
him for a while?

799
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:15,654
What is that?

800
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:18,198
Nick wanted to take a
look at the property.

801
01:06:18,253 --> 01:06:21,324
He'll be back before
the game starts.

802
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:28,415
Thanks.

803
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:00,118
Are we the first ones up?

804
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:10,004
You remember. Alex used
to call me Sam the Sham.

805
01:07:10,055 --> 01:07:11,666
Don't say that. It was real.

806
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:16,336
I stood with thousands of people
listening to you. You moved them.

807
01:07:16,395 --> 01:07:19,264
Now I reach millions
of people every week.

808
01:07:19,314 --> 01:07:21,174
Hell, it's just garbage.

809
01:07:21,275 --> 01:07:23,681
That's not true. You
entertain people.

810
01:07:23,777 --> 01:07:26,184
God knows, we need that now.

811
01:07:26,739 --> 01:07:27,769
I try.

812
01:07:27,823 --> 01:07:31,724
I try once every show to put
something of value in there.

813
01:07:31,785 --> 01:07:33,563
- But I don't know.
- You do.

814
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:34,686
I can see it.

815
01:07:35,664 --> 01:07:38,735
I feel my kids have gotten
something from J.T. Lancer.

816
01:07:38,751 --> 01:07:39,982
Really?

817
01:07:42,337 --> 01:07:43,700
Kids.

818
01:07:44,715 --> 01:07:47,038
There you go. You've
done something.

819
01:07:47,134 --> 01:07:50,584
You and Richard have built
something for yourselves.

820
01:07:52,056 --> 01:07:54,544
You know the secret of Richard?

821
01:07:56,727 --> 01:07:58,718
Remember my father?

822
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:02,837
I didn't want that to happen to me.

823
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:06,303
Richard looked like all that had
been missing in my childhood.

824
01:08:06,445 --> 01:08:09,848
A man like that could build a
stable environment for children.

825
01:08:09,907 --> 01:08:11,435
And he did.

826
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:13,732
It's just that now...

827
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,779
What?

828
01:08:21,877 --> 01:08:23,737
Well, you know.

829
01:08:25,172 --> 01:08:26,285
Tell me.

830
01:08:28,092 --> 01:08:30,830
Well, it's not like talking to you.

831
01:08:32,888 --> 01:08:35,413
All my life, deep inside...

832
01:08:35,891 --> 01:08:38,926
I felt there was something
I wanted to express...

833
01:08:38,977 --> 01:08:42,297
but always felt, I
don't know, stymied.

834
01:08:43,774 --> 01:08:47,259
I'm proud of what I did. I'm doing
a good job of raising my sons.

835
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:52,098
If it meant giving up my
writing, that's the way it goes.

836
01:08:53,784 --> 01:08:56,819
- You don't remember my writing.
- Sure I do.

837
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:59,822
It's just poems and short stories.

838
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:03,359
I didn't show it to many people.

839
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:07,908
Why talk about it?
I made my decision.

840
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:10,039
My children come first.

841
01:09:10,968 --> 01:09:14,204
It's just that now it
leaves kind of a...

842
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,587
I don't know, a space.

843
01:09:18,559 --> 01:09:20,882
And all of Richard's...

844
01:09:20,936 --> 01:09:25,264
country clubs and home
improvements and business deals...

845
01:09:26,316 --> 01:09:29,007
are pretty superficial stuff.

846
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:33,563
I'm not complaining.
Well, maybe I am.

847
01:09:33,991 --> 01:09:35,305
Sorry.

848
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:37,730
It's just...

849
01:09:37,786 --> 01:09:39,445
being with you...

850
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:42,780
opens me up somehow.

851
01:09:45,002 --> 01:09:46,530
Forgive me?

852
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:02,301
<i>Hail to the conquering heroes.
Come on, the game's starting!</i>

853
01:10:02,352 --> 01:10:04,675
You don't want to
miss any of the Blue.

854
01:10:04,772 --> 01:10:06,549
Yes, you do, all right.

855
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,591
<i>And you were ready to write
this one off at 10-0.</i>

856
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:14,559
<i>- I didn't say anything about that.
- I saw that smile.</i>

857
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:17,600
That pass, I can't believe it.

858
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:19,064
Go, go, go!

859
01:10:27,002 --> 01:10:28,447
A flag? What?

860
01:10:29,254 --> 01:10:31,079
What are they calling that?

861
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:32,612
- What is that?
- Clipping.

862
01:10:32,716 --> 01:10:34,292
That was a clean hit.

863
01:10:34,343 --> 01:10:37,295
- He clipped him.
- What are you talking about?!

864
01:10:37,388 --> 01:10:40,542
<i>Clipping. Called against Michigan.</i>

865
01:10:42,851 --> 01:10:44,925
Sorry, Chloe.

866
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:48,421
Come on, Blue, you're not supposed
to fold till the fourth quarter.

867
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:50,888
Don't heckle Bo. He's
got enough pressure.

868
01:10:51,777 --> 01:10:55,144
Where is Nick? I can't
believe he's missing this.

869
01:10:55,739 --> 01:10:58,691
Teach them the basics, Bo.
Ugliest helmets in the world.

870
01:11:02,955 --> 01:11:04,946
I don't know.

871
01:11:05,457 --> 01:11:09,737
Sometimes I wonder if I was
sick of being a good girl.

872
01:11:10,045 --> 01:11:12,950
I could be counted on
to do the right thing.

873
01:11:13,048 --> 01:11:15,573
It's a disgusting curse.

874
01:11:15,676 --> 01:11:18,793
Probably thought Alex could
touch that part of me...

875
01:11:18,887 --> 01:11:21,839
that was unpredictable and magic.

876
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:24,256
The part I was always afraid of.

877
01:11:24,393 --> 01:11:26,835
Who knows if it's even there?

878
01:11:27,896 --> 01:11:30,469
When it was over, everything
went back to how it was before.

879
01:11:30,566 --> 01:11:33,517
That's what we all agreed.
That's what we all said.

880
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:38,515
I was sorry everyone knew, but that
was as much my fault as anything.

881
01:11:38,615 --> 01:11:40,393
Of course...

882
01:11:40,492 --> 01:11:43,100
things weren't really the same.

883
01:11:43,746 --> 01:11:46,234
Alex withdrew from me then.

884
01:11:46,665 --> 01:11:49,154
I was probably different with him.

885
01:11:49,585 --> 01:11:52,276
We never wanted Harold
to think that...

886
01:11:53,797 --> 01:11:55,326
You can imagine.

887
01:11:57,634 --> 01:12:02,710
So we finally consummated
this ancient lurking passion.

888
01:12:02,931 --> 01:12:06,465
All it had done was put up
a wall in our friendship.

889
01:12:11,857 --> 01:12:13,136
What?

890
01:12:13,192 --> 01:12:15,016
He's not passing!

891
01:12:17,571 --> 01:12:20,855
Nobody in the area.
Who was he passing to?

892
01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:23,438
I'm sure you're happy.
He threw it right to you!

893
01:12:23,535 --> 01:12:25,016
Idiot!

894
01:12:26,038 --> 01:12:30,366
They're flying up a new quarterback
from Texas or something.

895
01:12:32,127 --> 01:12:33,987
What? I didn't throw the ball.

896
01:12:34,046 --> 01:12:36,285
So what am I, chopped liver?

897
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:38,579
- What are you talking about?
- You know.

898
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:40,873
- No, I don't.
- You know.

899
01:12:42,638 --> 01:12:44,415
You asked Sam.

900
01:12:44,515 --> 01:12:46,458
What is this, published somewhere?

901
01:12:46,517 --> 01:12:49,208
You know we can do it.
We've done it.

902
01:12:49,853 --> 01:12:53,257
Remember the march on Washington?
Armies of the night?

903
01:12:53,315 --> 01:12:55,057
I remember.

904
01:12:55,901 --> 01:12:57,726
I thought you'd be grateful.

905
01:12:57,778 --> 01:13:01,014
- You're sweeping me off my feet.
- I thought you wanted a kid.

906
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,679
Thank you, Michael.

907
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:06,318
This is a big decision.

908
01:13:06,412 --> 01:13:09,019
I'll get back to you
in the third quarter.

909
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:10,091
Look at this! This could be us!
The next generation.

910
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:12,460
It could be. Think about it.

911
01:14:12,519 --> 01:14:13,882
Think!

912
01:14:32,289 --> 01:14:33,734
Shit.

913
01:14:40,672 --> 01:14:42,450
- How you doing, Harold?
- Not bad.

914
01:14:42,508 --> 01:14:45,163
This guy claims to be
a guest. That true?

915
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,623
Depends. What'd he do?

916
01:14:46,678 --> 01:14:49,120
- For one, he ran a red light.
- No, I didn't.

917
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:52,501
- He became verbally abusive.
- You got etiquette laws here?

918
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:54,218
25 bucks he's hitting me for!

919
01:14:54,269 --> 01:14:59,345
He could be one of them Yankee
drug dealers we sometimes get...

920
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:01,433
passing through on
their way to Florida.

921
01:15:01,527 --> 01:15:04,300
This is my lawyer.
I don't have to take this.

922
01:15:04,363 --> 01:15:06,639
It's true, officer. Do
you have probable cause?

923
01:15:06,865 --> 01:15:09,354
Excuse me, aren't you J.T. Lancer?

924
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,771
Yes, sir, Officer.

925
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:16,239
I'll be. What's that
make you, Perry Mason?

926
01:15:17,042 --> 01:15:19,864
You know, Pete. He does
look suspicious to me too.

927
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:23,079
Let's take him out back and
kick the shit out of him.

928
01:15:23,549 --> 01:15:26,536
Must be quick. The second
half of the game's starting.

929
01:15:32,683 --> 01:15:35,504
I'd be willing to drop
this whole thing...

930
01:15:35,602 --> 01:15:38,128
if you could persuade
Mr. Lancer into showing us...

931
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:41,003
how he hops into
that sports car on TV.

932
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:43,760
I'd really appreciate it.

933
01:15:43,861 --> 01:15:46,599
I watch that show every week
and I've always wondered.

934
01:15:46,864 --> 01:15:50,018
Myself, I always have to
open the damn car door.

935
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,936
You have a hard top.

936
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:53,982
Don't do it.

937
01:16:00,044 --> 01:16:01,702
Go for it.

938
01:16:15,059 --> 01:16:16,504
I don't believe this.

939
01:16:21,482 --> 01:16:23,010
Damn it!

940
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:28,806
It's not that bad, guys!

941
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:30,689
Don't talk. Don't try to talk.

942
01:16:30,783 --> 01:16:32,525
Make sure you keep his arm up.

943
01:16:32,576 --> 01:16:34,852
Am I going to need a tetanus shot?

944
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:39,531
- You won't amputate, will you?
- I got to see.

945
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:40,987
What about my career?

946
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:44,613
I am sorry. I thought
they could do that stuff.

947
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,903
It's not your fault.

948
01:16:46,715 --> 01:16:49,453
- Enjoy that second half, now.
- Will do.

949
01:16:52,471 --> 01:16:55,921
Since when did you get
so friendly with cops?

950
01:17:02,356 --> 01:17:04,465
You know, you're fucking stupid.

951
01:17:05,776 --> 01:17:07,221
Stupid!

952
01:17:07,653 --> 01:17:11,352
That cop has twice kept this
house from being ripped off.

953
01:17:11,448 --> 01:17:13,641
Happens to be a hell of a guy.

954
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,735
And you...

955
01:17:18,872 --> 01:17:20,982
Come on, what is it?

956
01:17:27,297 --> 01:17:29,075
What is it with you?

957
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,498
Is jail another experience to try?
See what it's like?

958
01:17:38,475 --> 01:17:40,335
You know, I live here.

959
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:44,921
This place means something
to me. I'm dug in.

960
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:47,633
I don't need this shit.

961
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:01,147
You know, I really can do it.

962
01:18:01,206 --> 01:18:04,407
It's these damn running shoes.
They practically kill me.

963
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,154
We know you can.

964
01:18:06,587 --> 01:18:09,538
Being a private eye
is dangerous work.

965
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:14,122
I got to get back
to the game, coach.

966
01:18:14,636 --> 01:18:16,035
Walk.

967
01:18:17,973 --> 01:18:20,379
We're deep in the third quarter.

968
01:18:21,226 --> 01:18:23,502
Just testing. A little joke.

969
01:18:26,523 --> 01:18:30,591
Michael has graciously agreed
to act as stud for me.

970
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:32,846
A repeat performance.

971
01:18:32,905 --> 01:18:34,932
He didn't say that, did he?

972
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:37,681
Well, it's almost that romantic.

973
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:39,977
What are you going to do?

974
01:18:44,249 --> 01:18:48,068
I can't do it with him. Too
much history, it's not right.

975
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:52,492
I can't believe this. I'm just
deciding this as we speak.

976
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,039
It's not going to
happen this weekend.

977
01:18:57,304 --> 01:19:00,920
Maybe it's a sign from God
that I should reconsider.

978
01:19:01,058 --> 01:19:03,167
Too bad I'm an atheist.

979
01:19:07,523 --> 01:19:09,680
- Like what?
- Say anything.

980
01:19:09,942 --> 01:19:12,099
Tell us about your past.

981
01:19:12,236 --> 01:19:14,808
- I lived with Alex.
- Before that.

982
01:19:14,905 --> 01:19:16,480
Before that.

983
01:19:16,573 --> 01:19:17,936
Randy.

984
01:19:21,161 --> 01:19:25,655
I don't like talking about my
past as much as you guys do.

985
01:19:27,543 --> 01:19:29,534
Okay, I'll buy that.

986
01:19:30,629 --> 01:19:34,530
Can you tell us
something about Alex?

987
01:19:36,093 --> 01:19:38,001
Well, he was cute.

988
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:45,046
He said we made a good couple because I
had no expectations and he had too many.

989
01:19:49,106 --> 01:19:51,714
<i>He believed in reincarnation.</i>

990
01:19:54,236 --> 01:19:56,345
<i>He never ate meat.</i>

991
01:19:56,405 --> 01:20:00,899
<i>He said he was afraid he would
come back someday as a steak.</i>

992
01:20:04,538 --> 01:20:08,818
<i>He said he should have accepted
that Rutledge fellowship.</i>

993
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,578
<i>What's the matter, Nick?</i>

994
01:20:21,805 --> 01:20:24,675
Two, three, four.

995
01:20:45,287 --> 01:20:50,612
The biggest mistake I made was not
trying harder to steal you from Nick.

996
01:20:50,834 --> 01:20:53,442
You know I always
wanted you to try.

997
01:20:55,923 --> 01:20:57,617
I never got that feeling.

998
01:20:57,716 --> 01:21:00,123
I guess you weren't
paying attention.

999
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,418
It's a little late now, isn't it?

1000
01:21:06,809 --> 01:21:08,088
Is it?

1001
01:21:09,895 --> 01:21:11,554
What are you saying?

1002
01:21:11,605 --> 01:21:12,920
I think you know.

1003
01:21:13,524 --> 01:21:15,965
I think you've known
this whole weekend.

1004
01:21:16,235 --> 01:21:18,427
Wait, you mean you and Richard...?

1005
01:21:18,612 --> 01:21:21,599
See? You've always
been able to read me.

1006
01:21:21,782 --> 01:21:24,473
You know my life with
Richard isn't working.

1007
01:21:25,077 --> 01:21:28,064
Well, I knew you two
weren't exactly...

1008
01:21:28,122 --> 01:21:29,484
But I didn't think-

1009
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,364
I'm going to leave him.

1010
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:34,739
Let's get the Wonton
Express rolling.

1011
01:21:35,295 --> 01:21:37,155
You want to come along?

1012
01:21:37,214 --> 01:21:38,908
No, you go ahead.

1013
01:21:40,884 --> 01:21:42,662
I'll be right here.

1014
01:21:44,513 --> 01:21:46,836
Just climb in there regular, okay?

1015
01:22:07,286 --> 01:22:09,028
Listen to those guys.

1016
01:22:09,079 --> 01:22:10,655
Goddamn!

1017
01:22:11,957 --> 01:22:14,565
Remember the night
we saw them in Cobo?

1018
01:22:16,795 --> 01:22:18,537
No, you probably don't.

1019
01:22:18,922 --> 01:22:21,660
You were hallucinating
pretty bad that night.

1020
01:22:25,471 --> 01:22:27,710
We didn't even have any drugs.

1021
01:22:28,515 --> 01:22:32,499
Have you noticed anything
unusual about this weekend?

1022
01:22:32,644 --> 01:22:34,588
Other than Alex dying?

1023
01:22:34,688 --> 01:22:38,138
I've been getting some
pretty weird propositions.

1024
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:42,722
I don't think I could live
down here all the time.

1025
01:22:45,741 --> 01:22:48,858
Last year I went to Hawaii
with my friend Reena.

1026
01:22:48,911 --> 01:22:53,025
We ate at a Chinese restaurant.
When they brought the fortune cookies...

1027
01:22:53,082 --> 01:22:55,191
hers said, "You'll never
amount to anything."

1028
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,909
I don't believe it.

1029
01:23:02,132 --> 01:23:04,574
"Friendship is the
bread of life..."

1030
01:23:04,635 --> 01:23:06,792
Wait a minute!
"...but money is the honey."

1031
01:23:06,929 --> 01:23:08,540
It doesn't say that.

1032
01:23:08,597 --> 01:23:10,671
- You're kidding.
- That's great!

1033
01:23:10,766 --> 01:23:13,539
Even fortune cookies
are getting cynical!

1034
01:23:13,602 --> 01:23:15,047
Cynical? It's pragmatic.

1035
01:23:15,104 --> 01:23:17,343
I think it's touching.

1036
01:24:00,983 --> 01:24:04,516
There's nothing I'd rather do
right now than make love to you.

1037
01:24:08,574 --> 01:24:10,149
When it's over...

1038
01:24:10,242 --> 01:24:12,233
come into my life.

1039
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:16,818
You and your kids come out
to L.A., move into my house.

1040
01:24:17,124 --> 01:24:20,989
There's plenty of room.
It's lovely, it's great.

1041
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,538
I can't do that.

1042
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:28,701
It has to do with Robin.

1043
01:24:29,011 --> 01:24:33,078
No, it's not that. My
marriage is completely over.

1044
01:24:33,432 --> 01:24:37,843
When Robin and I broke up,
I had a million good reasons.

1045
01:24:37,895 --> 01:24:41,962
A million things that were
wrong with her, wrong with us.

1046
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:44,764
When I think back on it now...

1047
01:24:45,069 --> 01:24:49,562
and see my daughter with her new
father, I realize what broke us up.

1048
01:24:49,656 --> 01:24:52,976
What really did it, and I
hate to admit it, even now.

1049
01:24:53,786 --> 01:24:56,025
What did it was...

1050
01:24:58,123 --> 01:24:59,568
boredom.

1051
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:02,318
I couldn't stick with it.

1052
01:25:05,631 --> 01:25:08,536
I'd hate to see you
make that same mistake.

1053
01:25:11,887 --> 01:25:14,376
You're a much better
person than that.

1054
01:25:15,599 --> 01:25:17,922
Don't give me that shit!

1055
01:25:18,143 --> 01:25:21,261
For 15 years, you've acted like
I'm the one you really wanted.

1056
01:25:21,313 --> 01:25:23,221
You made sure everyone knew.

1057
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:25,632
And now I come down here-

1058
01:25:36,036 --> 01:25:38,145
Don't be mad at him, honey.

1059
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:42,401
Well, it's called an anus.

1060
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:47,538
I'm sure it is boring to hear it
20 times, but just ignore him.

1061
01:25:48,048 --> 01:25:49,624
All right.

1062
01:25:50,342 --> 01:25:52,334
Yes. Just a minute.

1063
01:25:52,386 --> 01:25:53,997
She's right here.

1064
01:25:54,638 --> 01:25:56,297
No, just hold on.

1065
01:26:00,185 --> 01:26:03,386
Hello, muffin. How are you?

1066
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:06,137
You got it? Great!

1067
01:26:06,191 --> 01:26:07,720
You did?

1068
01:26:07,776 --> 01:26:13,101
When I saw it, I said I have one friend
in the world who'd appreciate it.

1069
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,682
That's going to be
our little secret.

1070
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:24,195
As soon as your mommy
and daddy say you can.

1071
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:26,740
When do you get off from school?

1072
01:26:38,557 --> 01:26:40,714
So what would that have meant?

1073
01:26:40,809 --> 01:26:44,046
What do you mean? It
would've told us something.

1074
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:45,710
What are you talking about?

1075
01:26:45,814 --> 01:26:48,422
Meg is pissed off because
Alex didn't leave a note.

1076
01:26:48,525 --> 01:26:51,395
- Could he summed it up in a note?
- Maybe a long note.

1077
01:26:51,779 --> 01:26:55,063
I can sum up people's
lives in 32 paragraphs.

1078
01:26:55,115 --> 01:26:58,352
I did a rock band in a page and
a half and they had 2 drummers.

1079
01:26:59,161 --> 01:27:01,567
Do you think this is funny?

1080
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:06,617
One of our best friends kills
himself and we don't know why.

1081
01:27:07,211 --> 01:27:11,574
No one knows why anyone does anything.
Why did I choose these socks today?

1082
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:15,868
There's a great equation:
Your socks, Alex's death.

1083
01:27:16,887 --> 01:27:18,665
They're pretty sad socks.

1084
01:27:18,764 --> 01:27:22,048
I believe that everybody
does everything to get laid.

1085
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:23,843
Who said that? Freud?

1086
01:27:23,894 --> 01:27:25,292
No, I did.

1087
01:27:26,063 --> 01:27:30,130
All I'm saying is how could we
let Alex slip away like that?

1088
01:27:30,192 --> 01:27:32,432
Maybe he let us slip away.
I never heard from him.

1089
01:27:32,528 --> 01:27:35,563
- Did he hear from you?
- I tried. He resisted.

1090
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:37,054
It's true.

1091
01:27:37,116 --> 01:27:40,566
We saw him a lot.
But he didn't tell us much.

1092
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:42,320
Not me anyway.

1093
01:27:42,413 --> 01:27:44,522
I can't speak for Sarah.

1094
01:27:44,707 --> 01:27:47,658
I knew he was unhappy.
That doesn't tell you much.

1095
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:50,573
I had no idea how bad it was.

1096
01:27:50,754 --> 01:27:53,243
I think he wanted to
cut off from us...

1097
01:27:53,298 --> 01:27:55,787
because he was so unhappy
with where he was at.

1098
01:27:56,093 --> 01:27:58,701
Is that true, Chloe?
Did you feel that?

1099
01:27:58,929 --> 01:28:02,249
I don't know. We had
some good times.

1100
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:07,877
I haven't met many happy people
in my life. How do they act?

1101
01:28:08,605 --> 01:28:10,632
I'm sitting here and I realize...

1102
01:28:11,191 --> 01:28:13,847
I don't know what he
did for the last 5 years.

1103
01:28:14,653 --> 01:28:17,344
I remember he left that
caseworker job in Boston.

1104
01:28:17,448 --> 01:28:19,771
That was, what, '78 or so?

1105
01:28:20,242 --> 01:28:22,731
I don't know why he was doing that.

1106
01:28:22,786 --> 01:28:26,651
He was a scientific genius.
Why was he doing welfare work?

1107
01:28:26,707 --> 01:28:28,667
Then the construction job.
What was that for?

1108
01:28:28,959 --> 01:28:30,737
He didn't know what to do.

1109
01:28:31,253 --> 01:28:32,995
I can relate to that.

1110
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:37,451
If you'd been in touch with him,
you could've saved his life?

1111
01:28:37,676 --> 01:28:41,625
You have that effect on people?
Keep them all jolly, do you?

1112
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:45,416
Wise up, folks. We're
alone out there.

1113
01:28:45,476 --> 01:28:48,546
And tomorrow we're
going out there again.

1114
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:53,134
<i>It was straight of him not to cook
up a Reader's Digest condensation...</i>

1115
01:28:53,192 --> 01:28:55,717
of his screwed up life
for our entertainment.

1116
01:28:55,819 --> 01:29:00,099
I am sick of people selling
their psyches for attention.

1117
01:29:00,199 --> 01:29:02,107
He was classier than that.

1118
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:05,028
It was a real classy act
he pulled in the bathtub.

1119
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:09,817
For some people it isn't a question
of why kill yourself, but why not.

1120
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:15,364
Give me a break. Spare us the
tragic existential pose.

1121
01:29:15,422 --> 01:29:17,698
Didn't mean to get into your area.

1122
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:21,078
Come on now, guys. We're
all friends here.

1123
01:29:21,887 --> 01:29:23,332
This is a well-known dynamic.

1124
01:29:23,389 --> 01:29:25,139
I've seen it a million times.
Some people...

1125
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:29,208
ease the pain of separation by
denigrating their relationship.

1126
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:32,468
You're so deep.

1127
01:29:33,607 --> 01:29:35,716
I think Michael's right.

1128
01:29:35,776 --> 01:29:39,096
I feel shitty about 10
different ways tonight.

1129
01:29:39,154 --> 01:29:40,932
I don't want to let any of this go.

1130
01:29:41,156 --> 01:29:45,650
That's healthy. The only way to avoid
pain is to pretend you don't care.

1131
01:29:45,703 --> 01:29:47,942
I know. I've left more
places than you'll ever go.

1132
01:29:47,996 --> 01:29:49,739
Give him your pose line, Sam.

1133
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:52,446
There's the existential man for you.
You're one tough cookie.

1134
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:53,899
I could say you're one...

1135
01:29:54,002 --> 01:29:57,821
cold, manipulative guy
and it wouldn't bother you.

1136
01:29:58,215 --> 01:30:00,040
I'm deeply hurt.

1137
01:30:00,259 --> 01:30:02,119
At least our last
night will be fun.

1138
01:30:02,177 --> 01:30:04,287
Please don't do this, guys.

1139
01:30:05,097 --> 01:30:09,591
This is happening because we miss him.
And we're really hurting.

1140
01:30:10,894 --> 01:30:12,968
That's a crock of shit!

1141
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:16,341
We're afraid just the
opposite is true.

1142
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,676
Alex died for most of
us a long time ago.

1143
01:30:19,987 --> 01:30:22,393
I think you're a crock of shit.

1144
01:30:22,823 --> 01:30:24,850
Don't speak for me or anybody else.

1145
01:30:24,908 --> 01:30:27,267
You hate your life.
That's your problem.

1146
01:30:27,453 --> 01:30:29,610
- Don't tell us how we feel, okay?
- That's it.

1147
01:30:29,663 --> 01:30:32,947
That's all I'm saying. If I
hate my life, it's my problem.

1148
01:30:34,084 --> 01:30:38,234
Too bad you weren't around to
comfort Alex as compassionately.

1149
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:42,413
We go back a long way.

1150
01:30:42,509 --> 01:30:45,117
I won't piss that away because
you're higher than a kite.

1151
01:30:45,179 --> 01:30:48,048
A long time ago we knew each
other for a short period.

1152
01:30:48,098 --> 01:30:51,169
You don't know anything about me.

1153
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:54,585
It was easy then. No one had
a cushier berth than we did.

1154
01:30:54,646 --> 01:30:56,673
It's not surprising our
friendship could survive that.

1155
01:30:56,732 --> 01:30:59,505
It's only here in the
world that it gets tough.

1156
01:31:00,986 --> 01:31:02,597
I don't care what you say.

1157
01:31:04,073 --> 01:31:06,977
I know I loved you and
everybody else here.

1158
01:31:07,034 --> 01:31:09,939
And I'll go on believing
that till I kick.

1159
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,201
What's wrong with you?
What's happened to you?

1160
01:31:35,104 --> 01:31:36,418
Wait!

1161
01:31:41,944 --> 01:31:45,762
I believe you can help
other people. I really do.

1162
01:31:45,823 --> 01:31:47,137
Sorry about that.

1163
01:31:47,241 --> 01:31:48,721
I do too.

1164
01:31:49,159 --> 01:31:52,146
Not that you can save
them, probably not.

1165
01:31:52,246 --> 01:31:54,355
But you can do what you can do.

1166
01:31:54,415 --> 01:31:56,441
That's how I feel.

1167
01:31:58,961 --> 01:32:01,866
So lay into me now.
Really let me have it.

1168
01:32:01,922 --> 01:32:04,993
I was just trying to keep
the conversation lively.

1169
01:32:06,969 --> 01:32:10,585
So you'll continue to
love me no matter what?

1170
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,499
Just don't cross me.

1171
01:32:14,059 --> 01:32:16,252
Could you help me
in here for a sec?

1172
01:32:21,525 --> 01:32:24,809
Well, I think I've had enough.

1173
01:32:54,433 --> 01:32:56,922
I love you very much.

1174
01:33:00,355 --> 01:33:01,931
I'm yours.

1175
01:33:02,524 --> 01:33:05,262
I want you to do something for me.

1176
01:33:05,903 --> 01:33:07,182
Anything.

1177
01:33:07,738 --> 01:33:10,061
I'd marry you, if you want.

1178
01:33:10,157 --> 01:33:11,816
No, wait. I did that.

1179
01:33:12,242 --> 01:33:13,985
Yes, you did.

1180
01:33:14,036 --> 01:33:15,695
Thank God.

1181
01:33:17,915 --> 01:33:19,657
It's about Meg.

1182
01:33:46,151 --> 01:33:47,632
Where to?

1183
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,849
You know, I don't do anything.

1184
01:34:04,294 --> 01:34:05,490
It's me.

1185
01:34:05,546 --> 01:34:08,034
Come on in. Nobody else will.

1186
01:35:07,024 --> 01:35:10,178
This bed has always been
lucky for Sarah and me.

1187
01:35:13,489 --> 01:35:16,014
I got to try and relax.

1188
01:35:19,036 --> 01:35:21,442
I think I just forgot how to do it.

1189
01:35:39,807 --> 01:35:41,038
What, what?

1190
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:43,838
It's not going to come out right.

1191
01:35:43,977 --> 01:35:45,257
Try me.

1192
01:35:49,441 --> 01:35:53,556
I feel like I got a great
break on a used car.

1193
01:36:12,214 --> 01:36:13,908
I remember this.

1194
01:36:15,759 --> 01:36:18,035
I remember when he got this.

1195
01:37:09,855 --> 01:37:12,261
<i>I must tell you...</i>

1196
01:37:12,775 --> 01:37:16,011
<i>I'm picking up vibrations
here at the house.</i>

1197
01:37:16,111 --> 01:37:19,763
<i>I'm almost certain there's
sex going on around here.</i>

1198
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:24,770
<i>Have I ever told you how
beautiful your eyes are?</i>

1199
01:37:28,332 --> 01:37:29,812
<i>My head.</i>

1200
01:37:33,712 --> 01:37:35,193
<i>Your feet.</i>

1201
01:37:37,091 --> 01:37:38,701
<i>Tell me about the club.</i>

1202
01:37:38,759 --> 01:37:41,248
<i>Fuck the club. I couldn't
deal with the hours.</i>

1203
01:37:41,303 --> 01:37:43,543
<i>It'd be nothing but aggravation.</i>

1204
01:37:43,847 --> 01:37:46,669
<i>Let's say it becomes successful.
I become a star.</i>

1205
01:37:46,767 --> 01:37:51,012
<i>People magazine sends a
nasty schmuck like me...</i>

1206
01:37:51,063 --> 01:37:52,805
<i>to do interviews. Big deal.</i>

1207
01:37:52,856 --> 01:37:55,630
<i>Nope. I'm going back to my novel.</i>

1208
01:37:56,151 --> 01:37:57,596
<i>I'll write about this weekend.</i>

1209
01:37:57,694 --> 01:38:00,017
<i>What were you going to
write about before?</i>

1210
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:03,149
<i>Last weekend.</i>

1211
01:39:07,473 --> 01:39:09,879
If Richard and I bring
the boys to L.A...

1212
01:39:09,975 --> 01:39:13,211
maybe you could get
us in to see a studio.

1213
01:39:13,604 --> 01:39:15,179
Yeah, sure.

1214
01:39:15,272 --> 01:39:16,966
Absolutely.

1215
01:39:17,274 --> 01:39:18,849
No problem.

1216
01:39:19,777 --> 01:39:21,139
Good.

1217
01:39:22,571 --> 01:39:24,479
Richard would like that.

1218
01:39:36,543 --> 01:39:38,403
I'm the worst about writing.

1219
01:39:38,462 --> 01:39:42,197
But I promise I will, from
now on, answer your letters.

1220
01:39:42,257 --> 01:39:44,913
- Great.
- Good morning, youngsters.

1221
01:39:45,844 --> 01:39:49,081
So how did everybody
sleep last night?

1222
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:51,379
Did anybody sleep last night?

1223
01:39:53,352 --> 01:39:55,924
I know I did. All
alone in my airplane.

1224
01:39:55,979 --> 01:39:59,216
No co-pilot. I slept like a baby.
Even wet the bed.

1225
01:39:59,525 --> 01:40:01,598
Drink your coffee, Michael.

1226
01:40:03,570 --> 01:40:06,724
I'll come see you whether
you like it or not.

1227
01:40:07,658 --> 01:40:09,138
Well, good morning.

1228
01:40:10,619 --> 01:40:12,064
Good morning.

1229
01:40:13,163 --> 01:40:14,739
How you doing?

1230
01:40:15,874 --> 01:40:18,233
Don't have to be in
such a good mood.

1231
01:40:21,505 --> 01:40:24,326
Look what I found in Alex's papers.

1232
01:40:26,927 --> 01:40:29,618
I will be in Detroit
sometime on this deal...

1233
01:40:29,722 --> 01:40:31,998
and I'm just dying
to meet your boys.

1234
01:40:32,057 --> 01:40:33,288
I'd love it.

1235
01:40:33,392 --> 01:40:36,047
- You're all welcome in New York.
- Great!

1236
01:40:36,103 --> 01:40:38,876
Not in my apartment, you understand.
But in the city.

1237
01:40:38,939 --> 01:40:42,057
I'll accompany you anywhere,
even to Elaine's.

1238
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:43,549
Thought Elaine's was dead.

1239
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:46,218
That's why I can get you guys in.

1240
01:40:46,947 --> 01:40:48,096
What's that?

1241
01:40:48,157 --> 01:40:51,975
The column I wrote about Alex when
he turned down the fellowship.

1242
01:40:53,203 --> 01:40:55,562
This is not bad. Good, clean style.

1243
01:40:55,622 --> 01:40:59,322
Lean, economical, the right touch
of ideological fanaticism.

1244
01:40:59,543 --> 01:41:02,151
I remember Alex was
angry about that.

1245
01:41:02,254 --> 01:41:03,948
What do you mean?
I made him famous.

1246
01:41:04,048 --> 01:41:05,991
Think he saved it
because he hated it?

1247
01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:08,207
He also saved his induction notice.

1248
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:11,662
I'm collecting addresses.
Do you have one?

1249
01:41:11,722 --> 01:41:14,164
Or should I copy down
your license plate?

1250
01:41:16,685 --> 01:41:19,174
You can reach Nick
here for a while.

1251
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:24,180
Nick and Chloe will stay here and
do some work at the old house.

1252
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:40,031
I guess there's a certain
symmetry to that.

1253
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:46,074
What's the flight schedule here?
Is there any way...

1254
01:41:46,173 --> 01:41:48,330
to coordinate the
airport transport?

1255
01:41:48,384 --> 01:41:49,912
I'll be glad to drive somebody.

1256
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:52,748
Great, if we can take Harold's car.

1257
01:41:53,055 --> 01:41:54,417
Get Harold to drive it.

1258
01:41:54,473 --> 01:41:56,381
You're no fun.

1259
01:41:56,725 --> 01:42:00,045
That won't be necessary.
We took a secret vote.

1260
01:42:00,145 --> 01:42:02,304
We're not leaving.
We're never leaving.
