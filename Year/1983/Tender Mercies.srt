All right, but there's no drinkin'
while you're workin' here.

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,860

Wish I had time to stay out here in
the yard and enjoy it a little bit.

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,980
Why don't you?
Oh, I can't, honey.

58
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,940
I've got a million things
to do today.

59
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,700
I'll help ya.
Oh, I know you will.

60
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,460
Yes?

61
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,460
If you still need help the next
couple of days, I'd like to work on.

62
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,100
All right. I can give you your room and
your meals and two dollars an hour.

63
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,780
Thank you.

64
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,940
Find out what ya got to say

65
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,820
we first got this letter from a
very nice lady and her husband...

66
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,620
Who moved here to Texas,
and they like it.

67
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,060
And they liked the program. And they
said the only thing they didn't...

68
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,820
mister, what's your name?

69
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,140
Mac.

70
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,340
Don't throw stones at me, son.

71
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,580
- How was school?
- All right.

72
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,660
You learn anything?

73
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,580
Not much.

74
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,900
What are you doin' down here?

75
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,060
- Thinking.
- About what?

76
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,260
Things.

77
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,580
Good things or bad things?

78
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,620
Some of both.

79
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,180
You never knew
my daddy, did ya?

80
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,220
I never did.

81
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,780
Think you would have liked him
if you'd known him?

82
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,300
Sure. What do you think?
I guess.

83
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,980
I'll learn to love again

84
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,220
somehow

85
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,660
I'll even learn
to play the fool again

86
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,180
no, I'll never even learn

87
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,060
to say good-bye

88
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,220
to the woman that I've known

89
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,300
for so long

90
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,620
we have heard the joyful sound

91
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,220
Jesus saves, Jesus saves

92
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,540
spread the tidings all around

93
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,100
Jesus saves, Jesus saves

94
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,500
bear the news to every land

95
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,900
climb the steeps
and cross the waves

96
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,940
onward 'tis our lord's command

97
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,340
Jesus saves, Jesus saves

98
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,700
sing, ye islands of the sea

99
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,540
echo back, ye ocean caves

100
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,820
earth shall keep her jubilee

101
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,580
Jesus saves, Jesus saves

102
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,820
shout salvation full and free

103
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,980
highest hills and deepest caves

104
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,340
this our song of victory

105
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,220
Jesus saves, Jesus saves

106
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,180
good to see you, sir.

107
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,400
- Very nice.
- See you at the midweek service.

108
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,320
- Well, hi, Sonny. How are you doin'?
- Hi.

109
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,340
Hi, reverend.
I want you to meet Mac sledge.

110
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,600
- He works for me down at the motel.
- How are you, sir?

111
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,860
How do you do, Mr. sledge? Sonny
tells me he wants to be baptized.

112
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,220
I know that makes
you proud, rosa Lee.

113
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,860
- Yes, it does.
- You were baptized in this church, weren't you?

114
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,660
- Yes, sir, I was.
- And where were you baptized, Mr. sledge?

115
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,780
I haven't been baptized.

116
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,380
- Well, we'll have to work on you then.
- Yes, sir.

117
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,980
So long, Sonny. See you later.

118
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,740
Turn off the TV, Sonny, and get to bed.
You got school tomorrow.

119
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,140
- Can I talk with you all a little bit first?
- No, sir.

120
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

121
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,580
Good night.

122
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,900
Good little fella.

123
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,060
Yeah. He's growin' up so fast, he'll
be gone before I even know it.

124
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,380
- You have any other family?
- No.

125
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,620
I was the only kid my mom and daddy had...
had me kind of late in life.

126
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,300
My daddy's been dead... He died
two years after my husband was killed,

127
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,460
and mama died a year
and a half ago last spring.

128
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,340
My mama and daddy are dead too.

129
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,580
But I have a brother
out in California someplace.

130
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,100
We... lost track of each other.

131
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,500
- I have a daughter.
- You do?

132
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,660
Yeah, she's seven or eight
years older than your boy.

133
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,020
- Well, where is she?
- With her mama. Me and her mama are divorced.

134
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,540
We didn't get along
too well. I reckon I...

135
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,300
would you all stop talkin'?
I can't get to sleep.

136
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,980
I haven't had a drink
in two months.

137
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,780
- I think that drinkin's behind.
- Do you?

138
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
I'm glad. I don't think
it gets ya anywhere.

139
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,300
You ever thought
about marryin' again?

140
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,500
Yeah. I have.

141
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,860
Have you?

142
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,500
I thought about it lately.

143
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,580
I guess it's no secret how I feel about ya.
A blind man could see that.

144
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,940
Would you think
about marryin' me?

145
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,900
Yeah. I will.

146
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,900
Hey!

147
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,420
Your dad's dead.
I know he's dead.

148
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,260
He got killed in some dumb war.

149
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,540
- I know that. He got killed in Vietnam.
- What was his name?

150
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,780
Carl Herbert wadsworth. I was named after him.
I'm Carl Herbert wadsworth, Jr.

151
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,660
Well, how come everybody
calls you Sonny?

152
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,740
I don't know. They just do.

153
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,500
That man your mama's
married to now ain't your daddy.

154
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,780
I know that, dummy. I know what he is.
He's my stepdaddy.

155
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,980
Is he still a drunk?

156
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,940
- Hi. How was school?
- Okay.

157
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,580
Did my daddy go to the same
school I go to?

158
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,140
- Yes.
- Do I look like my daddy?

159
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,180
- Comin' with us, Mac?
- You go on. I'll wait here.

160
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,620
Here it is.

161
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,980
I couldn't put down the day he
died because the army didn't know.

162
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Was there a big crowd
at his funeral?

163
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,700
Yeah, there was.

164
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,100
- Did I go?
- No.

165
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,060
Why not?

166
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,780
'Cause you were too little.

167
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,180
Did people cry at the funeral?

168
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,140
- Yes, they did.
- Did you?

169
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,060
Yes, I did.

170
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,220
Morning.

171
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,980
Wanna fill it up?

172
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,100
- Mr. sledge.
- Yes, sir.

173
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,300
Are you Mac sledge, the singer?

174
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,620
I mean...

175
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,180
I was a singer, I mean.
I mean, I am Mac sledge.

176
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,680
You were married
to Dixie Scott, weren't ya?

177
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,740
- I got nothin' to say about that.
- She never married again, did she?

178
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,380
Are you remarried?

179
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,180
Is that your boy?

180
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,340
That's not your boy, is it?

181
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,660
Mr. sledge, it took me
quite a while to track you down.

182
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,260
I'd really appreciate
an interview.

183
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,620
I got nothin' to say
to anybody.

184
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,460
Well, are you doin'
any singing anymore?

185
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,180
Writin' any songs these days?

186
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,420
Somebody said that... I heard your new
wife is singing at the baptist church.

187
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,900
Say, I guess your daughter
by your first wife...

188
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,340
Has gotta be
goin' on 18 by now?

189
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,860
Hey, I'm gonna do a story,
Mr. sledge.

190
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,940
You ought to talk to me
to make sure I get it right.

191
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,420
You got two minutes? Won't ya
sit down and talk to me?

192
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,580
No, sir. Sonny.

193
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,700
K.O.K.E. Fm and am
in Austin, Texas.

194
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,180
People 'round here
know who you are?

195
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,380
Your ex-wife is singin' over in Austin in the
next couple of nights. Did you know that?

196
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,700
You gonna go over and see her?

197
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,240
Maybe your daughter'll be along. Maybe
she'll come over here and see you.

198
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,940
Does she know where ya are?

199
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,820
Well, Dixie told me
a lot about you.

200
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,860
Don't you wanna tell me
a few things about her?

201
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,340
She said alcohol...
alcohol is what licked ya.

202
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,740
You still drink?

203
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,660
- They say you were a rich man once.
- Who said?

204
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,140
Kids at school said
they had it in the paper.

205
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,220
I don't know if I was what you call
rich, but I had a few dollars.

206
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,380
How'd you get it?

207
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,980
- Writin' songs.
- And how do you get money for that?

208
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,060
Hell, if people are crazy enough
to pay for it, they do it.

209
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,020
- What happened to your money?
- I lost it.

210
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,180
- How?
- How?

211
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,140
Too much applejack.

212
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,060
You think you'll ever
be rich again?

213
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
Well, I tell you what, Sonny.

214
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,940
I don't lay awake nights
worryin' about it. Now, look.

215
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,880
There's a d, right? D as in dog.
Now watch me. I'll call 'em out.

216
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,820
I've decided to leave G.

217
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,700
Here forever not really.

218
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,340
Let me know if you're stayin'
behind that's a seven.

219
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,340
Otherwise, I'll be gone
in the mornin'

220
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,780
D as in dog.

221
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,100
Let me know
if you're staying behind

222
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,860
now you can play a covered
chord or a rhythm chord.

223
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,940
Let me know that's G.

224
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,620
If you always will want me

225
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,020
or if you'll wander

226
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,780
into another's arms

227
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,740
A or a seven.

228
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,540
G. Let me know what
you decide dear

229
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,420
then let me rest A.

230
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,620
My head for a while

231
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,820
I've decided

232
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,860
to leave here forever

233
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,060
D as in dog.

234
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,340
Let me know

235
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,380
if you're comin'

236
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
along

237
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,300
otherwise, I'll be gone

238
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,900
in the mornin' D.

239
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,940
Let me know

240
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,380
if you're stayin' behind

241
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,780
- hi.
- Hi.

242
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,620
- What can I get ya?
- About five dollars worth, please.

243
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,100
- Oh, excuse me. Is this where Mac sledge stays?
- Yeah.

244
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,740
- Is he here?
- Yes.

245
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,020
- Well, could we talk to him?
- What about?

246
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:53,860
- We just wanna meet him.
- We're admirers of his.

247
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,260
See, we saw the story in
the newspaper this mornin'...

248
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,500
And... Well, we got a band.

249
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,140
We'd just like to say hello
and pay our respects.

250
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,340
Yeah, we got all his records. We
grew up on his music. He's great.

251
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,540
That's five dollars.

252
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,260
- Pay up.
- I bought the beer.

253
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,960
I paid for the gas last time.
It's his turn.

254
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,900
- It's your turn, man.
- Pay up.

255
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,940
Well, could we see him?

256
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,260
- I'll ask.
- Great. - All right.

257
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,580
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, sir. - Howdy.

258
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,420
- I was tellin' this pretty lady here...
- This is my wife rosa Lee.

259
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,900
Pleased to know you, ma'am.
Ma'am.

260
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,700
We were sayin' we got a band,
you know, and...

261
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,820
- you five boys?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm the manager.
And I play the guitar.

263
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
And bertie's on bass,
Steve's on the fiddle.

264
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,220
And Henry plays the steel,
and Jake's drums.

265
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,380
Who does your vocals?

266
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,980
Well,
we all take turns on that.

267
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,340
See, you've been
a real inspiration to us all.

268
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,380
That's most gratifyin' to hear.

269
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,540
When you gonna start
singin' again, sir?

270
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,600
I'm not gonna start singin'
again, son. I've lost it.

271
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,100
You don't miss singin'?

272
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,340
No. Oh, I miss some things,
but I don't miss a lot of it.

273
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,060
So maybe we'll come
listen to ya some night.

274
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,580
Hey, we sure would like that.

275
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,220
Hey, we... we wonder
if you have any advice for us.

276
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,140
No, I don't really. Just, you know,
sing it the way you feel it.

277
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,620
Pleased to know you.
Nice to meet you.

278
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,620

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,740
She never thinks about you.
She's happy.

344
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,640
Lady, you're not tellin' me
what to do. You never have.

345
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,820
Harry, get him out of here.
I do not want him around.

346
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,900
Who the hell does she think she is?
She starts yellin' at me.

347
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,740
He is jealous of me because I am successful and he's not.
It's the way it's always been.

348
00:28:48,741 --> 00:28:49,774
Bullshit.

349
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,040
Bullshit! Make sure he
doesn't see sue Anne, okay?

350
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:53,714
All right.

351
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
Just make sure he does not
see sue Anne. You understand?

352
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,140
- All right. Settle down.
- Okay?

353
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,260
Settle down! How could... what...

354
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,180
I... you know, sometimes...

355
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,100
Jesus Christ.

356
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,060
You're home early.

357
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,820
Concert must not
have been very long.

358
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,500
- It was the regular time. I left early.
- Why?

359
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,380
- I didn't care for it.
- Why not?

360
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
Sonny in bed?

361
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,140
What you been doin'?

362
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,180
Not much.

363
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,500
You watch your TV?

364
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,380
Nope.

365
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,300
Then why are you so quiet?
Are you mad about somethin'?

366
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,900
My God, woman.
Don't tell me you're jealous.

367
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,780
Rosa Lee,
are you jealous of Dixie Scott?

368
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,140
- Maybe I am.
- Why?

369
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,100
'Cause, you know.

370
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,460
No, I don't know.

371
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,940
Well, because she's rich and famous,
and you used to be married to her.

372
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,100
My God, don't be jealous of her, rosa Lee.
She's poison to me.

373
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,540
- She's absolutely poison to me.
- Then why did you go listen to her sing?

374
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,780
Someday I'll tell you.
Why can't you tell me now?

375
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,860
- Because I can't.
- Why not?

376
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,780
- Because I can't.
- Why?

377
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,000
Because I can't. Goddamn it,
don't you understand English?

378
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,540
I understand English, and
you don't have to yell at me.

379
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,020
You'll wake up Sonny.

380
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,500
Look, Mac.

381
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,020
If you went hopin' to see your
daughter, I could understand that.

382
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,380
I mean, you could come right out
and tell me that.

383
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,860
I'd be lyin' if I told you
that was the reason.

384
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,780
Why? Didn't you want
to see her?

385
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,380
Of course I did. I tried to, but
Dixie saw me and pitched a fit.

386
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,420
How long's it been
since you saw her?

387
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,140
Since before the divorce...

388
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,180
seven, eight years.

389
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,300
Sorry.

390
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,700
Mac, Dixie told me to bring that
back to you myself...

391
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,020
tell ya it ain't no good.

392
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,480
She told me even if it was good,
she wouldn't sing it,

393
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,500
and she don't wanna have
nothin' to do with you.

394
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,740
I don't want anything
to do with her either.

395
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,620
I just wrote this song. I thought it was a
good song for her. I guess I was wrong.

396
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,160
- Now did you get a look at it?
- Yeah. I looked at it.

397
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,180
Well, what do you think?

398
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,740
I don't think
it's no good either.

399
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,700
It's a different game now.

400
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,220
Well, that's fine.

401
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,620
Ma'am.

402
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,140
I don't give a goddamn about any of this
no more, so what in hell is wrong with me?

403
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,020
I guess it's about sue Anne
bein' grown up and all.

404
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,580
No, no, no. It's gotta be hard on
you not bein' able to see her.

405
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,980
I love you, you know?

406
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,580
Every night
when I say my prayers...

407
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,260
And I thank the lord for his blessings
and his tender mercies to me,

408
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,540
you and Sonny head the list.

409
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,580
Thank you.

410
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,180
Would you... would you sing
the song you wrote to me?

411
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,500
- Well, it's no good.
- Well, I sure would like to hear it.

412
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,500
All right,
but it's kind of corny.

413
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,140
I don't care.
Well, you asked for it.

414
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,700
Let me get your guitar for you.

415
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,300
All right.

416
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,860
Let's see now.

417
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,180
Baby, you're the only dream

418
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,420
I've ever had that's come true

419
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,580
there's so much more
to reach for

420
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,540
thanks to you

421
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,060
all that I have is...

422
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,980
got no voice.

423
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,940
You know I don't like a song.
I never have, and I never will.

424
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,180
- Mac.
- Hey, don't feel sorry for me, rosa Lee.

425
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,380
I'm not dead, you know.
I don't feel sorry for you.

426
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,820
Mac.

427
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,900
Then he gets what he came after

428
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,620
you're gonna wake up all alone

429
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,060
- what do you want?
- I don't know.

430
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,020
You want a beer? You want food?

431
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,500
- You want a drink?
- I don't know yet. When I do, I'll let you know.

432
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,220
Pass the sugar, please.

433
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,260
Thank you.

434
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,660
I'm not strong mind not
playing that damn music?

435
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,140
Hell, yes, I mind.
Like I used to be

436
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,820
no, let me bring him back

437
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,300
what's wrong with him?
I don't know.

438
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,300
Get over, you redneck bastard!

439
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,180
- What are you doing, you dumb son of a bitch?
- Are you crazy?

440
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,380
- Hi.
- Hi. Is Mr. sledge around?

441
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,380
No, he's not here right now.

442
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,940
Tell you the truth, I don't know where he is,
and I'm not real sure when he's coming back.

443
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,300
Oh, well, I just wanted to
holler at him if he was here.

444
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,140
We're playin' at a dance
around here this Saturday night,

445
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,620
and I was wonderin' if we could
leave one of our posters with you.

446
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,140
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

447
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,580
Well, I'll be seein' ya.

448
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,940
Sometimes

449
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,060
some things are hard to break

450
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,180
with me

451
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,540
it's reality

452
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,340
and though someone
will take my place

453
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,460
I'll go on

454
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,700
lovin' you

455
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,260
through eternity

456
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,660
but, oh, it hurts

457
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,580
so much to face

458
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,140
reality

459
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,900
I wonder where Mac is.

460
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,340
I don't know, Sonny.

461
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,460
He's older than you are.
He's 15 years older than you.

462
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,660
That's no secret.
Everybody knows that.

463
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,380
I didn't know it
till they told me at school.

464
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,280
Well, I would have told you
if you'd asked me.

465
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,500
- Was my daddy older than you?
- Two years.

466
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,500
Let's see...

467
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,700
I got married when I was 16,
and I had you when I was 17.

468
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,820
And I was a widow at 18.

469
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,220
Then how come he went
to Vietnam?

470
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,100
He got drafted. He didn't know I was gonna
have you till after the army got him.

471
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,240
Boy at school says his daddy told him all
they learned in Vietnam was to take dope.

472
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,140
- Do you think that's right?
- I don't know, Sonny. I hope not.

473
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,980
- You think my daddy took drugs?
- No, I don't think so.

474
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,420
The kids at school take drugs.

475
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,740
I don't wanna hear of you takin' 'em.
If you do, I'll have your hide.

476
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,060
- What are you so mad about?
- Never mind that. You just listen to me about them drugs.

477
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,300
Where are you goin'?

478
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,440
I don't know.
I don't wanna stay around you.

479
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,780
All right. Look, Sonny.
I'm sorry.

480
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,340
Come over here with me.
Come here.

481
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,220
Look. I...
I didn't mean to yell at ya.

482
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,660
I'm just a little nervous
tonight, okay?

483
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,020
What song is that?

484
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,740
That's somethin' Mac wrote.

485
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,100
I wish he'd come on home.

486
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,380
Where do you think he is?

487
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,820
I don't know, Sonny.
Your guess is as good as mine.

488
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,980
- Fur.
- Very good.

489
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
Come on. Alpaca?

490
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,220
- Alpac...
- Is he here?

491
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,940
- No.
- Why'd you turn off the TV?

492
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,540
Because I was sick of it.

493
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,860
- You goin' to bed?
- Yes.

494
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,420
- When?
- Soon. Go to sleep!

495
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,420
Show me thy way, o lord,
and teach me thy path.

496
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,300
Lead me in thy truth
and teach me,

497
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,180
for thou are the God of my...

498
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,380
salvation, on thee
do I wait all the day.

499
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,380
Mac?

500
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,260
That you?

501
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,900
I'm not drunk. I bought a bottle,
but I poured it all out.

502
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,020
And I'm not drunk.

503
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,820
- Have anything to eat?
- No.

504
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,020
- Are you hungry?
- I guess so.

505
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,260
Let me get you something.

506
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,780
What do you want to eat? I made some soup.
Want me to heat it up?

507
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,220
- A little soup will do me.
- Okay.

508
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,500
I rode by here
six or seven times.

509
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,460
I could see y'all
sittin' here watchin' TV.

510
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,020
- See me ride by?
- No.

511
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,500
I rode all over town tonight. Started twice for San antone.
Turned around and came back.

512
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,860
Started for Austin;
Started for Dallas.

513
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,380
And I turned around, came back.

514
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,880
You remember that song you took
over to that guy in Austin?

515
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,540
Yeah.

516
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,100
Remember those boys who had that
band who came down here to see you?

517
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,660
Well, two of them came by today,
and they left off a poster.

518
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,340
And I asked them if they could read
music, and one of them could, so...

519
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,780
I asked him to teach me
that song you wrote, as I...

520
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,300
I thought I'd try to surprise you
by singin' it when you came home.

521
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,740
I think it's
a real pretty song, Mac.

522
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,620
Well, and he did too.

523
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:29,140
And he thought... well he'd
like for his band to sing it.

524
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,340
I said I didn't know.
I'd have to ask you.

525
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,620
I did say I would ask, but I
said you probably wouldn't care.

526
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,620
It's an old song.
It wouldn't make any difference.

527
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,780
Oh, it's no old song, rosa Lee.
I only wrote it last week.

528
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,580
That's why I got upset when
Harry said he didn't like it.

529
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,020
I been writin 'em all along.
I... I even got more in here.

530
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,660
You say the boy liked the song?

531
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,020
He said he did.

532
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,940
I sure liked it.

533
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,400
What are the names
of some of your other songs?

534
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,620
Well, one is called
"the romance is over,"

535
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,420
and one is called "God can
forgive me, why can't you?"

536
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,580
Did you learn the song?

537
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,140
Not well enough to sing it.
Can't read music.

538
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,140
How did you learn
to read music, Mac?

539
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,580
I had an auntie that taught me.

540
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,620
She had an old,
half-busted piano,

541
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,100
and she sat me down at that piano one
summer when I came in from the fields.

542
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,380
She taught me.

543
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,460
I've been missin' my music.

544
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,400
It may not be any good anymore, but
that don't keep me from missin' it.

545
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,620
- When did you get home?
- He got in just a minute ago.

546
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,620
- You said you were going to wake me up.
- I forgot.

547
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,500
- Good night.
- Good night.

548
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,220
I don't care if you give that
song to those kids to play.

549
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,660
- All right.
- Come on. Try it with me.

550
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:16,020
Baby, you're the only dream
I've ever had that's come true

551
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,900
come on.

552
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,740
If you just hold
the ladder, baby

553
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,020
I'll climb to the top

554
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,220
- sing it.
- I can't.

555
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,140
Why?

556
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,820
Come here.

557
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,820
Come over here.

558
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,260
You just walked
right outta here.

559
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,460
Drinkin' Canada dry

560
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:00,540
since my woman said bye

561
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,420
yes, I'm up here in the cold
and I want to get home

562
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,020
but I'll settle for a high

563
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,220
and as each double goes down

564
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,260
I toast another lonely town

565
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,180
this bottle's all I can see
till she comes back with me

566
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,020
drinkin' Canada dry

567
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,980
I call on
all the radio stations...

568
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,300
And try to get 'em
to play our records.

569
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,980
I've gotten to know some
of those boys pretty well.

570
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,400
I was tellin' 'em about this song...
the ladder song you let us play.

571
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,980
- Yeah.
- They...

572
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,100
they said we ought to try to talk
you into lettin' us record it.

573
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,180
Hi.

574
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,500
Course, they thought
the best idea would be...

575
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,340
To try to get you to give us
another song too.

576
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,820
- And then... then these friends of mine said...
- I do have another song.

577
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,060
Come by the house, and
I'll let you listen to it.

578
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,780
- Okay. Yeah.
- Thanks.

579
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,700
- How you doin'?
- Mornin'.

580
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,620
- What'll you have?
- Bag of feed.

581
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,940
- Okay.
- See...

582
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,540
we've been at this now for four years,
and everybody's married but me.

583
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,820
Jake's got a little girl too.

584
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,340
We still gotta travel all over
the state to get engagements.

585
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,800
Yeah, we didn't clear but a
hundred bucks last week.

586
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,600
We showed up at the golead the other night,
and they had another band a-pickin'.

587
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,340
How many recordings you make?

588
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,900
Three. But I haven't exactly told
you the truth about that, though.

589
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,720
- They broke even on all our records, but...
- yeah?

590
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,340
Even so, they're not gonna
record us with our own songs.

591
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,220
Yeah, it's a...
it's a dirty business.

592
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,400
Maybe it's the best thing that
can happen to you for now.

593
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,620
World isn't gonna come
to an end, I'll tell ya.

594
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,060
Yeah, I guess, but like I said,

595
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,620
we heard last week they'd record
us if we used two of your songs.

596
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,360
I gave you my permission.
I told you that.

597
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,180
Yeah, but...

598
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,460
it's not just your songs.
They want you to sing 'em.

599
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,940
- Who does?
- The record company.

600
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,260
What record company?
It's called the aztec.

601
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,300
Never heard of it.

602
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,340
How do you make it
on a hundred a week?

603
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,700
We all got other jobs.

604
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,900
Jake's in construction.
I'm a substitute teacher.

605
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,540
I don't know.

606
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,300
- Thank you.
- You bet.

607
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,220
Let me think about it.

608
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,100
Sure mean a lot to us.
You understand that.

609
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,860
It'd be a real incentive
for us all.

610
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,900
I'll tell you what.

611
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,060
I ain't promisin' nothin',
you understand.

612
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,260
I'll give it a try.

613
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,180
If I don't like the way it sounds,
we'll just back away from it.

614
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,860
- Okay.
- Give me a couple days to think it over.

615
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,340
Thank you.

616
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,780
Hey, mister,

617
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,140
were you really Mac sledge?

618
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,900
Yes, ma'am. I guess I was.

619
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,020
See that cloud

620
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,660
there in the sky

621
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,940
so lonely

622
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,260
drifting by

623
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,300
well, that's the way

624
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,900
she's adrift

625
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,780
from me

626
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,820
keep all my pride

627
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,420
to myself

628
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,860
I know

629
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,660
there's someone else

630
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,100
but, oh, it hurts

631
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,540
so much to feel

632
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,860
reality

633
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,180
- how you doin'?
- Hi, Mac.You got a visitor.

634
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,300
- Where?
- Living room.

635
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,340
Yeah?

636
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,820
Do you recognize me?

637
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,860
- Yes, I do.
- How did you recognize me?

638
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,060
I just did.

639
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,820
Y'all excuse us, please?

640
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,580
You've changed. You don't look
like your pictures anymore.

641
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,060
Don't I?

642
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,900
Well, God knows when the last
picture of me was taken.

643
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,980
It don't make a whole lot of difference,
but I did try to get in touch with you.

644
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,700
I wrote a few letters.

645
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,140
- Did you ever get 'em?
- No.

646
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,920
Well, your mama didn't have
to give 'em to you.

647
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,780
Courts gave her
complete jurisdiction.

648
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,700
Quite rightly,
I guess, considering...

649
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,660
My state at the time.

650
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,500
I told mama I was comin' here.

651
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,220
She told me she'd have me
arrested if I did.

652
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,540
And Harry reminded her that I'm 18
now, and I don't have to mind anybody.

653
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,140
Mama says you tried
to kill her once.

654
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,300
I did.

655
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,780
Why'd you try to kill her?

656
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,100
Well, she got me mad some way.

657
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,100
I was drunk. I don't know.

658
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,460
One of those things.

659
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,420
Someone told mama the other night you were
the best country singer they ever heard.

660
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,740
Mama threw a glass of whiskey
right in her face.

661
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,180
She said they were just
sayin' that to spite her.

662
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,980
You think you ever will
sing again?

663
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,780
Oh, I think about it
once in a while.

664
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,460
Sometimes I think I'd like
to earn a little money to...

665
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,780
Make things a little easier
around here...

666
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,180
Or to help out
if you ever needed anything.

667
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,780
I don't need any money.

668
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,760
Mama set up a trust fund out of all
the royalties she ever earned...

669
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,500
Singin' the songs
that you wrote.

670
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,820
I can buy myself
anything I want.

671
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,940
Anything I got
has come from your music.

672
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,420
Well, I'm happy for that.

673
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,260
But it wasn't just my music. It was your mama
singin' it too. You mustn't forget that.

674
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,380
- I know.
- Yeah.

675
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,260
You have some supper with us?

676
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,380
Well, thank you, no, I can't.
I have a date tonight.

677
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,060
Plays in mama's band.

678
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,780
We have to sneak around,
'cause mama don't like him.

679
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,180
Would you like to meet him?
He'd like to meet you.

680
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,400
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

681
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,560
I really wouldn't want your mama to think
we was gangin' up on her behind her back.

682
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,140
I could tell her
I was bringin' him here.

683
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,020
Well, all right, then.

684
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,300
- How about tomorrow afternoon?
- Fine.

685
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,820
- 2:00?
- Anytime. I'll be here.

686
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,700
You know, you haven't spoken my
name once since I've been here.

687
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,700
Don't you know my name?

688
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,740
Sure, I know your name.

689
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,660
I just kinda been figurin' out to
myself what I ought to call you.

690
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,540
When you were a little girl,

691
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,500
I used to call you "sister."

692
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,340
I started to call you that
this time, when I saw you,

693
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,280
but I didn't know if it would
mean anything to you or not,

694
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:29,220
or if you'd remember
me doin' that.

695
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,740
There was a song you used to sing
to me when I was little, I think.

696
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,940
It was somethin' about a dove.

697
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,220
Mama said she never heard
you sing it to me, but...

698
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,540
I think it went
somethin' about a...

699
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,620
"on the wings
of a snow-white dove,

700
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,860
he sends
his somethin'-somethin' love."

701
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,460
I don't remember that. I don't.

702
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,340
So who else had a good
science project besides you?

703
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,780
Cy Henderson.

704
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,860
Cy did? What'd he do?

705
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,420
He made this gigantic picture
of the world...

706
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,500
And he showed the crust
and the...

707
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,700
the core of the earth,
and you could open it up.

708
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,820
When Jesus went down

709
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,820
to the waters that day

710
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,140
he was baptized

711
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,020
in the usual way

712
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,300
when it was done

713
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,180
God blessed his soul

714
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,980
he sent him his love

715
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,020
on the wings of a dove

716
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:26,140
on the wings
of a snow-white dove

717
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:31,500
he sends his pure sweet love

718
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,580
a sign from above

719
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,100

She left a note.

731
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,180
Dixie found it this morning
in a hotel.

732
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,940
Sue Anne's eloped.

733
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,660
- Shit.
- Her mama's gone crazy.

734
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,900
Doctor's got her
pretty well doped up,

735
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,020
but it looks like we're gonna
have to cancel that show.

736
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,340
I don't know what she expects.
She spoiled that kid rotten.

737
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,560
I try to tell her a lot of people have
been married at 18. Some of 'em got kids.

738
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,860
Dixie was married at 18, but
I guess you know about that.

739
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,100
I guess so. Yeah.

740
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,820
What's the boy like
she's marryin'?

741
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,900
No boy.

742
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,740
Thirty years old. Been
married three times already.

743
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,620
Look, if you see her,

744
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,540
if you hear from her,

745
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,460
ask her to please
call her mama.

746
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,900
All right. I will.

747
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,020
I shouldn't have said
what I did about your music.

748
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:31,740
- It's all right.
- I can't promise ya nothin', Mac,

749
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,780
but I'll take the song
with me to Nashville.

750
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,180
I'll show it to whoever I can.

751
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,500
What's the $500 for?

752
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,660
It's earnest money. It's good faith money.
I owe you that.

753
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,980
No way, Harry. No, sir.

754
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,860
- Come on, Mac.
- No, sir.

755
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,900
You don't owe me anything.

756
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,980
Besides, I've got... Other
plans for the song right now.

757
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,620
You got other songs, Mac?

758
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,500
Yeah, I do.

759
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,220
- You gonna show 'em to me?
- No.

760
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:16,000
- Come on, for Christ sake!
- No, goddamn it, Harry. Don't you understand English?

761
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,340
- I don't want to show 'em to you.
- Why?

762
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,260
Because I don't want to,
so stop buggin' me.

763
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,220
You can't get sore at me
for askin' you that.

764
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,340
Change the subject, Harry. This
is my business, for Christ sake!

765
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,460
Look, you want to do somethin' with your
music, you know how to get ahold of me.

766
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,660
All right.

767
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,100
- You were 16 when you got married?
- Yeah.

768
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,100
Dixie was, what, 18
when I married her,

769
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,660
and I was 17 when I
married the first time.

770
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,080
You never told me
you were married before Dixie.

771
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,860
No?

772
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,220
I thought I told you
everything about me.

773
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,340
Oh, well, you didn't
tell me that.

774
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,580
Well...

775
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,220
I was tryin' to get
started in the business.

776
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,180
I was singin' in any honky-tonk bar
that would let me through the door.

777
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,580
And I wandered from town
to town, city to city,

778
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,020
lookin' for places to sing.

779
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,920
Findin' any kind of work I could
in a day to keep me alive...

780
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,940
So I could sing
and play at night.

781
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,460
Finally, Lois...

782
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,020
my first wife's name...

783
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,420
couldn't stand it;
She went home.

784
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,540
And I went back six months
later lookin' for her,

785
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,540
and I found her
livin' with another man.

786
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,620
Said she wanted a divorce,
so, hell, I gave it to her.

787
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,380
Swore I'd never marry again.

788
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,300
And when I met Dixie,
it changed my mind.

789
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,560
I was makin' a few records by then,
and she was singin' when I met her,

790
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,580
and she said she'd give it up
when she got married,

791
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:13,420
but then she recorded a song of
mine, and she done well with it...

792
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,820
And said she wanted to sing for five
years and get it out of her system.

793
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,020
Never happened. Never did.

794
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,380
Never did.

795
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,980
When at last

796
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,300
I kneel on the shore

797
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,260
and the fearful breakers wall

798
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,340
which span the peaceful lands

799
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:48,140
the valley of the blessed

800
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:52,140
then I hear him saying to me

801
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,180
then I

802
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,860
will finally see

803
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:14,380
upon your profession of faith
in our lord Jesus Christ,

804
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,380
I baptize you in the name
of the father...

805
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:20,580
And of the son
and of the holy spirit.

806
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,500
Upon your profession of faith
in our lord Jesus Christ,

807
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,140
I baptize you in the name
of the father...

808
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,980
And of the son
and of the holy spirit.

809
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,180
Amen. Amen.

810
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,500
Well, we done it, Mac.
We're baptized.

811
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,420
Yeah, we are.

812
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,180
Everybody said I was gonna feel
like a changed person.

813
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:34,060
I guess I do feel a little different,
but I don't feel a whole lot different.

814
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:35,700
Do you?

815
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,620
Not yet.

816
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,500
You don't look any different.

817
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,620

01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,260
Hey, Mac, that sounds great, okay?

866
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,340
- Real good, Mac.
- Thank you.

867
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,180
- That was wonderful.
- Thank you. I was a little nervous.

868
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,340
- Were you?
- Yeah, a little bit.

869
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,940
- Couldn't tell, could you?
- No, ma'am.

870
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,660
- It was all right?
- I thought it was great. - I liked it too.

871
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,120
- Mind if your mom and I dance?
- No, sir.

872
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,500
Come on. Let's go.

873
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,900
- Is that your daddy?
- No, that's my step-daddy.

874
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,940
My mama says he was
a famous singer.

875
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,100
- I guess so. Where's your mama?
- Over there.

876
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,020
- Shit.
- Is that your daddy with her?

877
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,900
No, that's a friend of hers.
My mom and dad were divorced.

878
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,980
Were your mom and dad
ever divorced?

879
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,900
No, he died in Vietnam.

880
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,220
- Did he get shot?
- I guess so.

881
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,100
- Don't you know?
- No.

882
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,140
I don't know how he died.

883
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,860
- Didn't you ever ask?
- No.

884
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,940
Come on. Let's dance,
will ya? Come on!

885
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:18,940
- I hope that man's never my step-daddy.
- Why? Don't you like him?

886
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,780
No. Do you like
your step-daddy?

887
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,460
Yes, I do.

888
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:31,100
- Better than your own daddy?
- I never knew my own daddy.

889
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,740
I know mine, and he's
not so much either.

890
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,300
- Hi.
- Is my daddy here?

891
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:54,160
No, he's in town.
He'll be back in a little while.

892
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:57,780
I wonder if he could cash
a check for me.

893
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,500
- How much?
- It's just a hundred dollars.

894
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,660
Oh, I don't know.

895
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,180
- Well, the check is good.
- I'm sure. I just don't have that much in the drawer.

896
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,300
I just have 25.

897
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,300
Oh, well, that'll help.

898
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:25,780
I appreciate it.

899
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:34,420
You been back long?

900
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,740
Well, we been back
a couple days.

901
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,580
You guys plannin'
to stay around here?

902
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:43,020
I don't know. We may stay.
We may move on.

903
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,380
My husband has to find work.

904
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:48,220
Mama stopped my trust
fund out of spite.

905
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,140
We met some musicians
in Austin the other night...

906
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,500
That said my daddy
just made a new record.

907
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,380
- Oh, he did.
- How did it go?

908
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:02,060
Pretty good, I think.
He seemed pleased.

909
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,780
Hey, are you a singer too?

910
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,820
I sing with the choir...
you know,

911
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,740
down at the church.

912
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,540
I thought about bein' a singer.

913
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:19,060
But I don't think I have any
voice, to tell you the truth.

914
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,540
I guess I was just goin' on
about singin' to devil mama.

915
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,380
My daddy's quit drinkin',
they tell me.

916
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,580
Yes, he has.

917
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,540
How'd he quit?

918
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,740
I don't know. He just quit.

919
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,260
Well, did you ask him to quit?

920
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,500
No.

921
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:44,020
He was working here, and I told him
he couldn't drink while he worked.

922
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,620
Sometimes he used to go off
and load up,

923
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,900
but gradually he even
stopped that.

924
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,340
My husband drinks.
Most musicians do, you know.

925
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,740
He says he'll quit
soon as he gets work, but...

926
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,900
sue Anne, do you have
a place to stay?

927
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:05,060
Yeah, we're stayin' at the
Jeff Davis hotel in Austin.

928
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,980
Well, if you need a place tomorrow
night, you're welcome here.

929
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,140
Thank you.

930
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:36,100
Has anybody in the orchestra
heard from them?

931
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:45,220
I give the marriage a month.
How long do you give it?

932
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,260
I don't know, Dixie.

933
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,540
- Don't you at least have an opinion?
- No. Not about that.

934
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:58,820
You know what's
just come to me?

935
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,860
I can't imagine.

936
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,340
- You can't imagine?
- No.

937
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,100
Mac is lyin' to you.

938
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,780
- What's he lyin' to me about?
- To spite me.

939
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,480
He knows where they are, and he's
just not gonna tell us out of spite.

940
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,460
He's tryin' to get back at us 'cause I
wouldn't sing that old song of his.

941
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:40,380
- Howdy there. How you doin'?
- Great. Here it is.

942
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,980
We just heard it.
We're real proud of it.

943
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,200
The record company says
it's gonna dorealgood.

944
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,900
Even Jake likes it.
Not much pleases old Jake.

945
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:52,480
- I'm glad you boys are pleased.
- We'll have to get a record player so we can listen to it.

946
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:55,580
- What, y'all don't even have a record player?
- We have a radio and a TV.

947
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,880
Y'all come over to my house right
now, and I'll play it for you.

948
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,140
- All right.
- I'd love to hear it.

949
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,460
We'll see y'all over at the house.

950
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:05,080
Better start listenin' to the radio too,
because they're givin' it some play.

951
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,540
- You bet.
- Get in there.

952
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,140
See y'all later.
See ya in a bit.

953
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,060
- Bye. So long.
- Bye.

954
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,220
Hello?

955
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,660
That was Harry silver.

956
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:30,920
They got a wire this mornin'
that my daughter was killed...

957
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,820
In an automobile accident
somewhere...

958
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,260
In northern Louisiana.

959
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,860
I didn't catch
the name of the town.

960
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,900
A little child

961
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,340
boy or girl

962
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:04,140
will dream at night

963
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,020
in their own dream world

964
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,020
and as they play

965
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:13,300
they pretend that they

966
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:16,300
believe

967
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:21,020
well, I'm no child

968
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,020
but times it's true

969
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:26,500
I pretend

970
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,220
I'm not losing you

971
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,300
because it hurts

972
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,100
so much to face

973
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,140
reality

974
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,660
Dixie's not doing well at all.

975
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,100
What about sue Anne's husband?

976
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:57,180
Well, he's gonna live. In the hospital.
He was drunk.

977
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,700
It was all his fault.

978
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:06,100
Dixie wanted a closed casket
on account of the accident.

979
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:09,140
I thought it would be easier
on her, on everybody...

980
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:12,020
If we left this down
at the funeral parlor, but...

981
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,060
She wanted it brought
back home.

982
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:41,380
Little sister.

983
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,060
Dixie?

984
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,140
Dixie, Mac is here.

985
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,820
- Where is he?
- He's right here.

986
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,860
Hello, Dixie.

987
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,860
Hi, Mac.

988
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,380
Mac,

989
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,740
why has God done this to me?

990
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,060
Why has God done this to me?

991
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,420
Oh, you know, I did everything
I could to stop her. I...

992
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:49,020
I begged and I pleaded and...

993
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,140
I gave her everything
in the world she ever wanted.

994
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,420
I had nothin'
when I was her age.

995
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,500
Do you remember?

996
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:09,420
Yeah.

997
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,820
I gave her everything
money could buy.

998
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:30,180
That was our little girl, Mac.

999
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,140
No, see, I want to see
my little girl.

1000
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,020
I brought her back here to be with me.
Just let me out!

1001
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,740
I want to be with my little girl!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!

1002
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,740
- No! No!
- Be still. Be still.

1003
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,860
Mac?

1004
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,780
You okay?

1005
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:23,180
I was almost killed once
in a car accident.

1006
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:25,300
I was drunk...

1007
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:28,220
And I ran off the side of the road
and I turned over four times.

1008
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:32,720
And they took me out of that
car for dead, but I lived.

1009
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:38,460
And I prayed last night
to know why...

1010
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,300
I lived and she died, but I
got no answer to my prayers.

1011
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,740
I still don't know why
she died and I lived.

1012
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,880
I don't know the answer to nothin'...
not a blessed thing.

1013
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,000
I don't know why I wandered out
to this part of Texas drunk...

1014
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,740
And you took me in and pitied me
and helped me to straighten out,

1015
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,020
marry me.

1016
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:09,300
Why? Why did that happen? Is
there a reason that happened?

1017
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,620
And Sonny's daddy died
in a war...

1018
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,660
my daughter killed in an
automobile accident. Why?

1019
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,140
You see,
I don't trust happiness.

1020
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,460
I never did. I never will.

1021
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,220
- Where's Mac?
- He's outside.

1022
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,700
He got you something.
It's in your room.

1023
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,260
How did my daddy die?

1024
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:58,180
- I don't know, Sonny.
- Was he killed in battle?

1025
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:00,540
Honey, I just don't know.

1026
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:03,140
Didn't you ever ask anybody?

1027
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:06,020
Yes, I asked someone.

1028
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:09,200
And they couldn't tell me anything
except that he'd been found dead.

1029
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:12,900
See, he was alone
when they found him,

1030
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,780
and they couldn't be sure
how long he'd been there...

1031
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:20,100
Or if he'd been in a battle, which battle,
because there were three in the area that week.

1032
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,340
It could have been
in any of 'em, they said.

1033
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,720
Or he could have been out walking,
they said, and a sniper got him.

1034
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:34,180
Where would he be walking to?

1035
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,740
They didn't have
any more idea than I did.

1036
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,820
He was just a boy.

1037
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,740
But he was a good boy.

1038
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,040
I think he would have been
a fine man.

1039
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,940
I think you would have been
proud of him.

1040
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:51,260
I know he would have been
proud of you.

1041
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:23,820
Thanks for the football, Mac.

1042
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:25,740
You're welcome, Sonny.

1043
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:36,580
Good!

1044
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:41,060
Hey!

1045
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,860
I'm gonna send the ball.

1046
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:57,420
Come on. Throw it to me!

1047
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,740
Go on!

1048
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,580
Come on.

1049
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,540
With tender hands

1050
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:22,540
you gathered up the pieces

1051
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,660
of my life

1052
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:32,340
lying in your loving arms

1053
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:37,740
never felt so right!

1054
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,980
The hard-luck road

1055
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,140
behind me

1056
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:49,540
is reflected in your eyes

1057
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,420
and the glory
of the bright lights

1058
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,700
can't compare to this feelin'

1059
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:57,780
when you smile

1060
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:04,180
you're the good things
I threw away

1061
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:09,460
comin' back to me every day

1062
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:15,180
you're the best
it could ever be

1063
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:19,460
you are what love means to me

1064
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:31,820
I've been around
and seen it all

1065
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:35,060
from the bottom to the top

1066
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,460
and honey

1067
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:43,180
I can tell you now

1068
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,460
I'm thankful for what I've got

1069
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,540
these prison walls

1070
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,260
inside me

1071
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:58,340
never let this poor soul free

1072
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,460
till the power
of your true love

1073
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:06,060
broke them down
just in time to rescue me

1074
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:12,780
you're the song
I could never write

1075
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,540
you're the magic
in my heart tonight

1076
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:23,900
when the morning sun
comes shining through

1077
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:28,540
I'll still be holding you

1078
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:34,860
you're the good things
I threw away

1079
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,780
comin' back to me every day

1080
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:45,860
you're the best
it could ever be

1081
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,780
you are what love means to me

1082
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:15,980
you're the good things
I threw away

1083
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:21,220
comin' back to me every day

1084
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:25,740
you're the best
it could ever be

1085
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:29,580
you are what love means to me

1086
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,900
you're the best
it could ever be

1087
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:40,660
you are what love means to me
