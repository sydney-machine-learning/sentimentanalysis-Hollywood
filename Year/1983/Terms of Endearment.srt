1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,950
Let me go, just for a minute.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're going to stare that baby
into a coma.

3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,950
Stop exaggerating.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not good to keep checking
and imagining terrible things.

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,000
- I know, I know.
- Here it starts. Here we go.

6
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,000
Rudyard...
Rudyard, she's not breathing.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Honey, she's sleeping.
The baby's sleeping.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No...

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
- Rudyard, it's crib death.
- It's sleep!

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,000
- She's asleep, honey.
- Maybe.

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,000
Come on!

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Emma.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, good.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's better.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, thank you.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thanks. Emma?

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He was one of the most dependable men
that ever worked for me.

18
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,000
- I know. Thank you.
- He was a good man.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm real sorry about your daddy.
Take care of your momma.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Emma? Emma, wake up, please.

21
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,950
- Wake up.
- What's wrong?

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was tense and I was wondering
how you were feeling.

23
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,000
- Would you like to sleep in my bed?
- No, thank you.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Would you like to sleep
in my bed again?

25
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes!

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What are we going to do
with this hair?

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hey, Emma!

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Patsy, hurry up!
You're going to miss him.

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, that's what they were looking at!

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,950
- Good night, honey.
- Where's Momma?

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,950
That old fart's trying
to get in her pants.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
- What if the astronaut shows up?
- Oh, they're everywhere in Houston!

33
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,000
- Say hi to Race.
- OK. Love ya. Astronauts!

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,950
So?

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
- We better get going.
- I'll say goodbye. Want to go with?

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,950
No. I don't think I'm up to it today.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sure would be nice
to have a mother somebody liked.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why don't you accept the fact that
you have certain biological needs?

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
- Because I don't.
- Mom! I'm going now.

40
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,000
Excuse me.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Can you believe it?
He wants to take me to Tahiti.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know why you treat these men
like this. They have feelings too.

43
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,950
- Has the astronaut moved in yet?
- Who?

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Patsy teaching you coy lessons?
Breedlove. Has he moved in?

45
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,025
- Put your socks up!
- Say goodbye to Patsy.

46
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:14,000
- Be home by eleven.
- Say goodbye to Patsy.

47
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,000
- Goodbye, Patsy!
- Thank you.

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In this day and age, anything goes!

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I feel really foolish getting stoned
to hear Mary Martin.

50
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,950
See, Patsy...

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is not Mary Martin,
this is Ethel Merman.

52
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is the last time
we're gonna be like this.

53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I just plain refuse
to get into that kind of thinking.

54
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,950
It should not stop.

55
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,500
I mean, we're gonna be best friends.

56
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,000
Our babies will be best friends.

57
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,000
We'll all be best friends.

58
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, God!

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
- Just a minute.
- Open the door.

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Emma, open the door.

61
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,000
Just a minute.

62
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
- I need to talk to you!
- All right.

63
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm getting married. What the hell?

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
- Meet me in my room?
- Yes.

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
- What do you think she wants?
- Maybe to tell you how to have sex.

66
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,000
What?! No. She only knows
how to avoid it.

67
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't believe you said that.

68
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it, I swear.

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What have you been doing, Emma?

70
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,000
Nothing.

71
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,950
What is it, Momma?

72
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I really want to get some sleep so
I look halfway decent for tomorrow.

73
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,950
Come on. What is it?

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Would you want me to be silent
about something for your own good?

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes, ma'am, I would!

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
OK, come on.

77
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come on.

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,950
I've been in here all night.

79
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I've been trying to decide what...
what wedding gift to get you.

80
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I thought of that Renoir
that my mother gave me.

81
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,950
But I couldn't reach a conclusion.

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Then I came to grips with the reason
why I couldn't think of a gift.

83
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, Momma, it's all right.
I need dishes, a rotisserie...

84
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,000
A car... a house...

85
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm totally convinced
if you marry Flap Horton tomorrow,

86
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,525
it will be a mistake
of such gigantic proportions,

87
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:14,000
it will ruin your life
and make wretched your destiny.

88
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why are you doing this to me?

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are not special enough
to overcome a bad marriage.

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,950
Use your brains.

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,950
Flap is limited.
He hasn't got any imagination.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Even at this age, all he wants
is a secure teaching job.

93
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,950
Mother...

94
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,950
I'm marrying Flap Horton tomorrow.

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,950
I thank God
Flap's getting me out of here.

96
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If this is your attitude,
don't come to my wedding.

97
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's right.

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,950
No, I think you're right.

99
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The hypocrisy was bothering me, too.

100
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
My own mother's
not coming to my wedding.

101
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,500
Listen to her. She's going crazy.

102
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,950
I'll give her until noon tomorrow.

103
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,950
Emma, your mother
boycotted your wedding,

104
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
she hates your husband
and only holds you in medium esteem.

105
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Medium esteem.

106
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That is so cute. That is so cute.

107
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Wouldn't it have been strange
to marry a person who didn't read?

108
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There's millions of interesting
people who never pick up a book.

109
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Flap, I feel so totally good about
us. I hope I get pregnant tonight.

110
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,000
That would be nice.

111
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I love the way you look.

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're so nice.

113
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I... You're my sweet-assed gal.

114
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Here comes the bride!

115
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Wait, Flap. Where did you learn
how to do that?

116
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That is the strangest
music to make love to.

117
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,000
I know.

118
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Leave me alone. I'm happy.
I don't want to talk to you.

119
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,025
No. Did you see the tablecloth
Rosie gave me?

120
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:09,000
It's beautiful.
It's got red flowers on it.

121
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,950
She made it. No, not yet.

122
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,950
Home-made omelettes.
Just ordered 'em. Kinda Tex-Mex.

123
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No. That was the worst thing
you've ever done to me, Mother!

124
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,950
Well, I think you owe my husband
an apology.

125
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Until you apologise,
I'm not listening to your gossip.

126
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No. Well, he's right here.

127
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Hold on.

128
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes. Yes.

129
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,950
Hello, Mrs Greenway.

130
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, ma'am, I am not
enjoying your predicament.

131
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,950
Momma, be nice!

132
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
As a matter of fact,
I don't need or desire an apology.

133
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
All I want is for you to understand
and appreciate my position,

134
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,000
to respect our marriage,

135
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and to wait another 15 minutes
before you call in the morning.

136
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes, I guess I've said my piece.

137
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,950
OK, I'll put her on.

138
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He's so great!
I'll talk to you later.

139
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,500
I don't care about the neighbourhood.

140
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,000
Can't you stay a little while longer?

141
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I thought we were having
a real good time, didn't you?

142
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,950
Listen, don't go yet.

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
One more minute.
I've got something to show you.

144
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,000
No, really.

145
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
- Thanks.
- Good night.

146
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
- I bought you something.
- What?

147
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
A tie.

148
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,950
You didn't buy this for me.

149
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You were worried about
how I'd look to your mother.

150
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,000
Stop being a Quisling
where she is concerned.

151
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,000
Whenever I get happy,
you turn perverse.

152
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
- Buying this tie made you happy?!
- Yes! Yes!

153
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I wish you could understand,
cos you really don't.

154
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,000
It made me very happy,
buying this tie.

155
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,000
I went to two or three places.

156
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Then describing your jacket, knowing
it would match what you're wearing,

157
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,000
which, by the way, it certainly does.

158
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,000
I mean, it was fun!

159
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It was a goddamn Mardi Gras and
you're too dumb to understand that!

160
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,950
I'm sorry. I'm being terrible.

161
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Going to your mother's,
it makes me a little irrational.

162
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,950
Can I help?

163
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,950
Yes. Thank you, Flap.

164
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Take this candle. I need another one.

165
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,000
- In the kitchen?
- Yes.

166
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,000
That looks great.

167
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Who's that short gentleman?

168
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Not that it's any of your business...
Just leave it at that.

169
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What are you looking at?
She isn't there any more.

170
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,950
She'll be back.

171
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm Edward Johnson, Aurora's friend.

172
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,950
Pleased to meet you. Vernon Dahlart.

173
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
God, isn't she something?
Here she comes.

174
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,950
I met her two weeks ago at church.

175
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You might say she's God's gift
to Vernon Dahlart.

176
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Then you like her?

177
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh, no. Does it show?

178
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Good food.

179
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, this is what I used to serve
when I lived in Boston.

180
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,950
Vernon, you haven't said a word.

181
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Is that right? I feel like
I haven't stopped talking.

182
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,000
I guess because
I've been thinking about you so much.

183
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,000
Can I suggest how to handle me?

184
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,950
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,950
Don't worship me
until I've earned it.

186
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate
any advice you can give me.

187
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,000
Don't talk
with your mouth full, Vernon.

188
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,950
I wouldn't do that.

189
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I just did it to make you laugh.

190
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What's wrong with you?

191
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I got some good news.

192
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,950
What's that?

193
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,950
I'm unofficially pregnant.

194
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We haven't gotten the tests back yet,
but you know me, I'm never late.

195
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,950
Well...

196
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't understand.

197
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If you're not happy for me,
I'll get so mad if you're not happy.

198
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why should I be happy
about being a grandmother?

199
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Does this mean you won't be
knitting any booties?

200
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Flap...

201
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Every time you get more than
two drinks in you, you confront me.

202
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,950
And I won't have it.

203
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I won't have it,
not in this house. Excuse me.

204
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,950
Do you need some help?

205
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
No. I'll be fine
just as soon as I stretch my legs.

206
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,950
Oh, God.

207
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Mr Breedlove.

208
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You're bleeding.

209
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah.

210
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's OK.

211
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Come on in.

212
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,950
No, thank you.

213
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What are you afraid of?

214
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,000
Afraid?

215
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Well...

216
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Why not...?

217
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Why not come on in?

218
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Because you're much older
than the boys I date,

219
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,950
cos you're drunk,

220
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and because when I went to see
an astronaut give a lecture,

221
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,950
I didn't expect him
to prowl after us all night.

222
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I didn't expect some silly flirt
who had to keep his jacket open

223
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,000
because his belly's getting too big.

224
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I expected a hero.

225
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, OK, Doris, don't come in.

226
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't want you in my house.

227
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Lee Anne, would you like to come in?

228
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,000
You better tend to that cut.

229
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Tommy, show me your belly.
Come on. Come on!

230
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
- How can you dress him like that?
- He's adorable. Look at him.

231
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, great, Tommy.

232
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's Vernon. So tell him I'm...

233
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,000
- Out?
- No. Tell him I'm resting.

234
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,500
Hello?

235
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,000
Hi, Flap.

236
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Where? No. Tell me now.
I want to know now.

237
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,950
Oh, Flap, you did not
expect I'd be happy.

238
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Let's be honest with each other
before we start pretending.

239
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Look, Mom's staring at me right now,

240
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
so can I talk about it later to you?

241
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,950
Yeah.

242
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
All right.

243
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,000
Bye.

244
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,950
How long you going to
keep this a secret?

245
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The only school that would accept
his associate professorship

246
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
is in Des Moines.

247
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
He can't even do the simple things,
like fail locally.

248
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's gonna be all right, Momma.

249
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,950
It's Des Moines.

250
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
- Say, "Bye-bye, house".
- Bye-bye, house.

251
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Be careful going down these steps.
Don't break your leg.

252
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Come here.

253
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Come here. Come here.

254
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Stay sweet, honey.

255
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,950
Rosie...

256
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's enough, Rosie.
They have to get started.

257
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Tell Momma to drive you home when
you work late. Have some fun, Rosie.

258
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,000
Don't act so brave. I know you'll go
crazy without me to nag.

259
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,000
Be good to her or else we'll get you.

260
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I mean it.

261
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Bye, Flap. Have a good drive.

262
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
OK, fingers and toes in.
Take Momma's purse.

263
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Momma, that's the first time
I stopped hugging first.

264
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I like that.

265
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Get yourself a decent
maternity dress.

266
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,000
You had to get one in, didn't you?

267
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Will you tell her, Patsy?
She keeps thinking it's me.

268
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Tom... Are you gonna be good
to your mother and take care of her?

269
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Bye, Mrs Greenway.

270
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,950
Goodbye.

271
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Write as soon as you get there,
so I'll have your address, OK?

272
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,000
You shape up, Patsy.

273
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,950
Dropped my gum.

274
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We'll get you another piece,
sweetheart.

275
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The phone bill will be enormous,
you know that?

276
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'll miss you, Momma.

277
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
- Can we go now?
- Yeah. Pull away slow.

278
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Honey, I think it will be good for us
to be away from your...

279
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,950
Our families.

280
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
- I miss Houston.
- You don't know how lucky you are.

281
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,500
Everybody wants to go to Des Moines.

282
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,950
People come from all over the world

283
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
to get one look at Des Moines
before they die.

284
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,000
Some people say
it's the best city in Iowa.

285
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I know you're teasing me.
Texas is the best!

286
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,950
Well, I think
you should stop worrying.

287
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
We're gonna see
some terrific new things. We are.

288
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Would you please, if you will,
hold it down over there?

289
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,950
Sorry, I can't hear you.

290
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Hold it down! Have some respect
for other people's feelings!

291
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,950
Come over a little closer.

292
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Hey, you in the bush,
I can't hear you!

293
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,950
Sorry, but I just took a sauna.

294
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's hard not to yell when you hit
that cold water.

295
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You're not gonna ignore me
when I speak directly to you?

296
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,950
I'm not ignoring you.
What am I supposed to say?

297
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
OK, It's hard not to yell
when you hit that cold water.

298
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,000
Hey, come here.

299
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Come here?

300
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What is your name?

301
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,000
- Aurora?
- Yes.

302
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,950
You want a shock?

303
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
No, not especially. What?

304
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Well... We're going to have
this dinner at...

305
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,950
a NASA dinner at the White House.

306
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You know, some cosmonauts
and all of us, and...

307
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,025
I didn't know who I could take.

308
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:30,950
Cos all the people I flew with,

309
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
well, their wives are giving me
bitch bites all over my back

310
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,950
if I showed up
with my regular girls.

311
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I didn't know anybody old enough,
so I thought,

312
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,000
"Well, I'll ask
my next-door neighbour. "

313
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,950
Well, anyway,
they cancelled the dinner,

314
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
but I was really thinking
about asking you out.

315
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Seriously. Ain't that a shocker?

316
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yes.

317
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Imagine you having a date with
someone where it wasn't a felony.

318
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
What would you have said
if I'd asked you?

319
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Seriously.

320
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I would have said I'd like to see
the White House.

321
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,000
So you would have come?

322
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What the hell. You want to have
dinner out some time?

323
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,950
- No, thank you.
- What about lunch?

324
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You ladies, you like
to have lunch a lot, don't you?

325
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:40,000
You know, there's something
about your manner.

326
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,000
It's like you're trying
to toy with me.

327
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,950
That's right, Aurora.
I'm playing with you.

328
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
- This is exactly...
- Do you want to play, Aurora?

329
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You wanna go to lunch,

330
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,000
we'll have lunch.

331
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,950
If you want to have lunch
in some restaurant

332
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
to improve the atmosphere in this
neighbourhood, I wouldn't say no.

333
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Come here.
We're too far apart to talk.

334
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Now... Aurora.

335
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Since you've agreed,

336
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,950
why don't we just
forget about the rest?

337
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I mean, I know how you feel.
There were countdowns...

338
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,950
when I had my doubts.

339
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I said to myself,
"You agreed to do it.

340
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,525
"You're strapped in...

341
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,950
"and you're in the hands

342
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
"of something bigger
and more powerful than yourself.

343
00:30:53,050 --> 00:31:01,000
"So why not just lay back
and enjoy the ride?"

344
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm not going.
There is something wrong with you.

345
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh, God, I'm such a shit.

346
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
- Wait! That must be it.
- Right there? Oh, God!

347
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, Flap, it's great.
Is that it, really?

348
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
- I think that's it.
- Oh, it's great. Isn't that sweet?

349
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
- Oh, that was a bump.
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
- What is that?
- Shall we go see the house?

351
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,000
You stay here.
I'll come round and get you.

352
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,000
Come on. Let's get this off.

353
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Come on.

354
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Come on.

355
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
- Sweetheart, did you hurt yourself?
- Nope, not yet.

356
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,000
Do you like it? Do you like it?

357
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, it's great. Flap, it's great!

358
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,000
Oh, my God.

359
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Leave the mattress here.
We can sleep here.

360
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm really tired.

361
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You ever made love in Iowa?

362
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You know what? Tommy's room
is on the other side of the hall,

363
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,950
so we can get noisy.

364
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Good. You get to make your little
high-pitched squeak.

365
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Stop it! What about you?
What about you?

366
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,000
"Here I come. Here I come again!

367
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,000
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"

368
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Here I come again.

369
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,000
Yes.

370
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yes.

371
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

372
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,000
You just made me wet.

373
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
How can you do that with your voice,
just like that?

374
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,950
You just make your voice like that.

375
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Oh, God, if Tommy can't hear us,
we can't hear Tommy!

376
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
- He's fine, mother!
- Don't get pissy, I'll be back!

377
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I have papers to grade.
This isn't love, it's selfishness.

378
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,000
It's been a week since
we've been together.

379
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,950
We've never gone a whole week, Flap.

380
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
- Sure, we've gone a week.
- Only in the real pregnant months.

381
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You're always getting home so late,
Flap. Oh, forget it. Forget it!

382
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Do me a favour. Don't make me feel
silly, I won't make you feel guilty.

383
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Fair enough. I have to hurry.

384
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Be a good boy.

385
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,950
Emma?

386
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I love that you came back. You're
saving our lives by doing this.

387
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,000
I love that you came back, Flap,
I love it!

388
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,950
Tommy, breakfast will be in a minute.

389
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Let's hurry.
I've got to grade those papers.

390
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,000
I'll give everybody a B!

391
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,525
Come on! Wait!

392
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:23,000
Come on, come on!

393
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,950
Hello? Hi, Mother.
Could we talk later?

394
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I've got to get the boys off and it's
not a good time to be on the phone.

395
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,500
Don't be so inconsiderate.
I'm all set to have a good talk.

396
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,000
You've got almost an hour
to get the boys off. What's wrong?

397
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,000
- Nothing.
- Stop here. Tell me what it is.

398
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
OK, Mother. I need some money.
I need you to loan me some money.

399
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,000
I really need it, so will you?

400
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Oh, Mother, please don't be quiet.
You know that was hard for me to ask.

401
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,950
You can say no,
but please don't be quiet.

402
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I was just thinking.

403
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,950
Thinking what?

404
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
How much I hate to part with money.

405
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,950
I wouldn't have asked if...

406
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Don't yell, but I really think
that I may be pregnant again.

407
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,950
Oh! No!

408
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, no! And you're going
to have it, I suppose?

409
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yes, of course.
What's happening to you, anyway?

410
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,950
Don't act like that's so terrible.

411
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Bright young women
are having simple abortions.

412
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,000
"Simple"?

413
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,500
Then they get wonderful jobs.
You can have it in Colorado.

414
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:31,000
I don't know why I tell you anything.
I seem to like you less.

415
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You know why? I am the only person
who tells you the truth.

416
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,950
Go get dressed.

417
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
How will your life get better if you
keep having children with that man?

418
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,000
What miracle is going to come along
to rescue you?

419
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Leave me alone. I need the money.
Give me the painting to sell.

420
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,950
No! That's your security.

421
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I will not have you
using that for rent!

422
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,950
Let's not do this. All right?

423
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
All right? I'll talk to you later.

424
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,000
All right?

425
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,950
All right. If it would mean that...

426
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
No, don't give me the money.
It'd make you crazy.

427
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,950
Yes, it would.

428
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We'll talk later. You call me
tonight, if you want, all right?

429
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Goodbye.

430
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,950
Daddy just got home.

431
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Hey, no kidding?
Is it tough being a genius?

432
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,000
Boy!

433
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Great news. I know what my topic is.
I have it all figured out.

434
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
What's wrong?

435
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,950
Where have you been all night, Flap?

436
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm sorry. I fell asleep on
that big sofa at the library again.

437
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't know what's wrong with me.

438
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm on to you.

439
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm not doing anything.

440
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,950
Oh, yes, you are.

441
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We go through this stage
every time...

442
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,000
Don't change the subject.

443
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,525
What's the subject?

444
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,950
That I'm on to you.

445
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You wouldn't try to look so innocent
unless you were guilty.

446
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,000
You'll have to take my word for it.
You have no other choice.

447
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Excuse me.

448
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Emma, you... always get
a little paranoid

449
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,000
in your first few months, OK?

450
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,000
Just...

451
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,950
If you are doing something

452
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and you're trying to make me feel
crazy because I'm pregnant,

453
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,950
then you may have sunk so low
that you'll never recover.

454
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You may have just panicked, Flap,
and trying to save yourself,

455
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,950
you've thrown out
your character and principles.

456
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
The only way to redeem yourself, and
be the man God intended you to be,

457
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,000
is to admit anything you
might have been doing last night.

458
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Cos if you don't do that,
if you don't do that right now,

459
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,950
you are a lost man.

460
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
A shell, a bag of shit dust.

461
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
You've got to tell me.
For us, honey. Come on.

462
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Hello?

463
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Hello, Aurora.

464
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,950
How are you?

465
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,500
Yes, she is. She's right here.

466
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,000
Nice to hear your voice again.

467
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Why don't you get a job
if you're worried about money?

468
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,950
What about the baby?

469
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,950
It's a great day
when you get tenure!

470
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
All tenure means is
we won't have enough money forever!

471
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,950
Why don't you ask your mother?

472
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
- That's convenient for you!
- Go ahead! Call her!

473
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Why should today be any different?

474
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,950
Get on the phone, Emma!
Get on the phone!

475
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,950
- Why don't you call?
- Yeah, I'll call Aurora, right

476
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Get on the phone! Get on the phone!
Get on the phone, Emma!

477
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:49,000
Get on the phone!
Get on the damn phone!

478
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
- Mommy said to wait right here.
- Stay if you want.

479
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
What are you guys doing here? I told
you to wait in front of the house.

480
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,950
Answer me, Tommy.

481
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I didn't want people
to think we lived there.

482
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,000
What?

483
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I didn't want people
to think we lived there.

484
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Cut it out.

485
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
OK. You're allowed to say
one mean thing to me a year.

486
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,025
That'll do till you're ten.

487
00:42:29,075 --> 00:42:30,950
You're driving Daddy away.

488
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
OK, Tommy. Stand up and follow me.
Don't make me hit you on the street.

489
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,000
Hurry up.

490
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I said hurry. Come on!

491
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Forty-four dollars.

492
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Twenty, thirty...

493
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Let's see. That's $38.40...

494
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You don't have enough money?

495
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't have any cheques. I guess
I'll have to put some things back.

496
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:23,000
Can I have the register key?
She doesn't have enough money!

497
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's no big thing.
I brought the wrong purse.

498
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,000
Here, take this.

499
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
43.75.

500
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
41.35.

501
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
- You said I could have something!
- I won't give her real food.

502
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,000
- Give her this.
- No way!

503
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:51,025
- 40.35.
- Mom!

504
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:54,000
All right. Here.

505
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,000
40.55.

506
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
40.75. We're going
in the wrong direction.

507
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,025
Why do you have to be so damn nasty?

508
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,537
It's not going to help anything.

509
00:44:09,587 --> 00:44:12,000
We're both people, you know?

510
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,950
40.75.

511
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I don't need it.

512
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,950
Mrs Horton, I'm Sam Burns
from the bank.

513
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I turned you down on the second
on your house.

514
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,000
Oh, of course.
I remember who you are.

515
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,950
Can I help you make up
the difference?

516
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Thanks. I'd appreciate it.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

517
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,950
You're a very rude young woman.

518
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I know Douglas and I doubt he'd want
you treating customers so badly.

519
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,000
I don't think
I was treating her badly.

520
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,000
Then you must be from New York.

521
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
- Be careful, Teddy!
- What?

522
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,000
Be careful!

523
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
- Where's your car?
- Right here.

524
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That was worst time ever. I didn't
know I could get cheered up so fast.

525
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,025
- No problem.
- Come on, Mom.

526
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:18,000
- Wait by the car.
- Come on!

527
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,950
- Wait there.
- No!

528
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,950
- Wait by the car, honey.
- But...

529
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Wait over by the car, honey!
Over by the car!

530
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,000
Now! Now!

531
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Now!

532
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Nice boys.

533
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You're great with them, too. Really.

534
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I think all three of us
are going through a stage.

535
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,000
- Hey, thanks again.
- Oh, no thanks required.

536
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,000
I've had a lovely time.

537
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,950
Me, too.

538
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,950
I'll get the money back to you.

539
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, don't bother yourself.
Just drop it in the mail.

540
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,950
- To the bank?
- Sure.

541
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
You could even use
a cheque-by-mail envelope.

542
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:07,000
Or... you could come in.
Whichever.

543
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,000
Maybe I'll come in some time.

544
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Well, that'd be fine.

545
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
- Hey, can I help you with that?
- No, thanks. I'm used to this.

546
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
"And so, another birthday
for a gal named Aurora Greenway

547
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:36,525
"Even though 50,
she still takes my breath away

548
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:41,000
"Mere mortals just gaze
as she lights up their sky

549
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,000
"A heavenly object, a siren's cry"

550
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
You're the best. Happy birthday.

551
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Thank you, Edward.

552
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,950
Thank you.

553
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Do you want one, Vernon?

554
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,000
Would you like a kiss?

555
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
You're not lying about your age,
are you?

556
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,950
Of course not.

557
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,950
I thought you were 52.
She's really 52.

558
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Come on, how do you expect
to fool a family doctor?

559
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,950
- It seems to me she said her age.
- Thank you.

560
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
The number doesn't matter,
but the effort to conceal it does.

561
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,000
- Why does he keep talking?
- Dr Ratcher...

562
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,000
I'm trying to do some good here!

563
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
- The way to adjust to old age...
- Doctor...

564
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I think you're confused,
being recently widowed and all.

565
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You OK?

566
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Let's give her some privacy.

567
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah? The door's open.

568
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Just a minute.

569
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Well, hello.

570
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Hi.

571
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I was curious if you still wanted
to take me to lunch.

572
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,950
I wasn't aware that we...

573
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
A few years back,
you invited me to lunch.

574
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,950
A few years back?

575
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I wondered if the invitation
still exists. Would you like to?

576
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,950
Do lunch.

577
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
- Not dinner, remember. It was lunch.
- Why not? No.

578
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,000
Good.

579
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
When?

580
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Tomorrow?

581
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
All right. All right.

582
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Good.

583
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Twelve thirty?

584
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,000
Twelve.

585
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Good.

586
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Thank you.

587
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Thanks.

588
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
If you mind the open air,
I could get the top.

589
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,950
No. Don't worry.

590
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Grown women are prepared
for life's little emergencies.

591
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,950
Us going out together...
Not bad, huh?

592
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Do you think...? Do you think
you could possibly put the top up?

593
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,000
The top's at home in the garage.

594
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Hello, there. How are you?

595
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
How are you, Ali?
It's nice to see you.

596
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Fred, that we met at that bar.
He asked me out.

597
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,950
- Oh, God.
- We went to the Cadillac Bar.

598
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's a fun place if you're with
the right people, but I wasn't.

599
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Well... I'm starving!

600
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
No hidden meaning in that remark.

601
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Well... Would you like an oyster?

602
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
No.

603
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
- Thank you.
- It's good.

604
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,950
I think that is extremely rude,

605
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
noticing other women
when you're with me.

606
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,950
I...

607
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,950
think we're going
to have to get drunk.

608
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I don't get drunk,
and I don't care for escorts who do.

609
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,950
You got me into this.

610
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You're just gonna have to trust me
about this one thing.

611
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:10,000
You need a lot of drinks.

612
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,950
To break the ice?

613
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
To kill the bug that you have
up your ass.

614
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,950
May I get you something?

615
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yes, I think I will have some
bourbon, preferably Wild Turkey.

616
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,950
Yes?

617
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,950
You're not fun, by any chance,
are you?

618
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I don't really think we should think
about that right now.

619
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Impatient boys
sometimes miss dessert.

620
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
We both got here at the same time!

621
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Hi, Sam. How are you?
It's nice to see you.

622
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's always so nice to see you.
I can hardly believe it.

623
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,000
You, too.

624
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,950
What I didn't expect
was there to be moments

625
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
where I'd forget to be scared
someone would see us together.

626
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,950
Sam, you don't have to be scared.

627
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,500
I mean, contemplating sin
is all we've done, it's OK.

628
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,000
Oh. I'm glad that you've been
contemplating it, too.

629
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,950
I didn't know that.

630
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Well, all these lunches,
all this hand holding?

631
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm not going back to the bank
this afternoon.

632
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,000
I have to go out
and inspect a new house.

633
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's pretty far out,
and, well... it's empty.

634
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,950
- I gotta pick up my kids at five.
- Oh, OK.

635
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Well, I understand.
Look, don't give it a thought.

636
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Emma, I haven't made love
to a woman...

637
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
in almost three years.

638
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
How come?

639
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
My wife has a disc problem.

640
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And she can't take having...

641
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,000
any weight on her.

642
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Sam, I hope you don't mind me
asking you this, but...

643
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:38,000
have you ever thought of
your wife getting on top?

644
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh, she wouldn't do that.

645
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,950
She may surprise you.

646
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
No, I don't think so.
It would be so unlike her.

647
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,000
- Did you ask?
- About 600 times.

648
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,950
What are you thinking?

649
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,950
Tell me, do you prefer Texas to Iowa?

650
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
- What were you really thinking?
- Really, that's what I was thinking.

651
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I don't know, there seems to be
an absence of wildness, you know?

652
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,950
Even in the people!

653
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Well, we're farmers and we talk poor,
because the farmer aspect is

654
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,525
"don't let anybody know
you have anything"

655
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:32,950
and "don't call attention
to yourself".

656
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
My wife says... Well, I guess
we shouldn't talk about Dottie.

657
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Wind in the hair! Lead in the pencil!

658
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:50,000
Feet controlling the universe!

659
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:52,000
Breedlove at the helm!

660
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Just keep pumping that throttle!

661
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Keep giving it that gas!

662
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I see the Gulf of Mexico below me!

663
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm not enjoying this!

664
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,525
Give it a chance.

665
00:57:09,575 --> 00:57:11,787
I am going to stop!

666
00:57:11,837 --> 00:57:14,000
Fly me to the moon!

667
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,950
How are you?
It's not my fault, but I'm sorry.

668
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
If you wanted to get me on my back,
you just had to ask me.

669
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,950
My hand!

670
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,950
Get it out of there!

671
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
- I can't! I swear!
- Get it out!

672
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,950
- I swear to God!
- Out!

673
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
We were having such a good time
and you had to go do this!

674
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:13,000
Please, anything!
Bend down! Bend down!

675
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
- Why did you have to get drunk?
- I am not drunk... any more!

676
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:25,000
The pain sobered me up.

677
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Emma, this is terrible to ask -
are you thinking about your husband?

678
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,950
- I was a little.
- We can go back.

679
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,950
No, Sam. Stop it.
Look, I want to do this.

680
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm glad I don't know whether
Flap's been with someone else.

681
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:03,000
I'd hate to think I was doing this
just to get even.

682
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Oh, just... Look... Great! Fine.

683
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Great!

684
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You're parked in my driveway!
You're breaking the law!

685
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Thank you!

686
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,950
Would you like to come in?

687
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,950
I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.

688
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Everything would have been just fine
if you hadn't gotten drunk.

689
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:43,000
I just didn't want you to think
I was like one of your other girls.

690
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Not much danger in that unless you
curtsy on my face real soon.

691
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,950
Garrett!

692
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
What makes you so insistent
on shocking and insulting me?

693
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I mean, I really hate that
way of talking. You must know that.

694
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Why do you do it?

695
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,950
I'll tell you, Aurora.

696
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I don't know what it is
about you, but...

697
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
you do bring out the devil in me.

698
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,950
Where are you?

699
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
In the laundry room
so nobody could hear.

700
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:29,000
Sam, I can't hear you, either.

701
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Wait a minute.
We're getting a quieter cycle.

702
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,950
- OK.
- Can you hear me now?

703
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,950
- Yeah.
- Good. Is it bad to call?

704
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
No, I'm in the market
for a little sweet talk.

705
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,000
- Mom, I have to go!
- Just a minute.

706
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,000
- What?
- Really!

707
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Hurry up.

708
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,950
- What is it?
- Just how absolutely good I feel.

709
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And even though I'm scared,
and we've committed adultery,

710
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,950
no matter what happens,

711
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I'm just so grateful
to God or the devil

712
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:10,000
for... letting me
feel this way again.

713
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,950
I'm so glad you told me that.

714
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
- Don't flush!
- You told me always to!

715
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,950
Not this time.

716
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
- Emma, is it OK? Can you talk?
- No, it's all right.

717
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:24,000
- Can I hold Melanie?
- Yes.

718
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,950
- Honey, is everything OK?
- What?

719
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
- Is everything OK?
- Everything's fine.

720
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:33,950
Oh, yeah. Everything's fine.

721
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,000
An emergency call from Mrs Aurora
Greenway in Houston for Emma Horton.

722
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,950
- Oh, no!
- She does that when the line's busy.

723
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
- Will you release?
- Of course. We were just talking.

724
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:50,000
Talk to you later, Sam. Bye.

725
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,950
Hi. How'd it go?

726
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,950
The astronaut is impossible.

727
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,500
An arrogant, self-centred,
and, yes, somewhat entertaining man

728
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:05,275
who has realised his ambition,
and is at last a spoiled child.

729
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:09,662
- A match made in heaven.
- Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you?

730
01:02:09,712 --> 01:02:14,000
I don't think he wants to have
anything more to do with me.

731
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:17,000
- Oh, why?
- I don't wanna go into it.

732
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,950
- Cos you wouldn't go to bed?
- On a first date, Emma?

733
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
It's hardly a first date.
You've lived next door for 15 years.

734
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
- Why not say the real reason?
- What do you mean?

735
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,000
It's been that long
since you've done it.

736
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,000
Shut up! I mean it! Shut up!

737
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:37,525
Oh, it's just me.

738
01:02:37,575 --> 01:02:38,950
- No.
- Call him!

739
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,500
- No! I'm hanging up.
- OK, I'm sorry.

740
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,000
- I'm hanging up.
- Call him now! So long.

741
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
- Hello?
- Hello, Garrett.

742
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,000
Yes?

743
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,950
Well, I was just sitting
here realising...

744
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
realising that
I had never shown you my Renoir.

745
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,950
What are you talking about?

746
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,950
I'm inviting you to come over
and look at my Renoir.

747
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
- You're inviting me to bed.
- It happens to be in my bedroom.

748
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:15,000
Is the Renoir under the covers?

749
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,500
Don't cackle, Garrett.

750
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:21,950
Do you want to see it?

751
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Do I want to come to your bedroom?

752
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,950
- Let me think.
- Do you?

753
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Just give me a minute.
It's a tough one.

754
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I guess... I don't know.

755
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Yeah, OK. I guess so, sure, why not?

756
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,950
I'll see you in a bit.

757
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
If I don't answer the bell,
the back door's open.

758
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:59,000
The back door's open.

759
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
My God. He ran it.

760
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Hi.

761
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I was doing laps when you called.

762
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Lucky for us, I only did eight.

763
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
This is it.

764
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
This is the Renoir.

765
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I like it.

766
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I like the painting.

767
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I like everything in here.

768
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,950
Relax, baby...

769
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Now, just who do you
think you're talking to like this?

770
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:58,000
Don't you realise
I'm a grandmother?

771
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It's not flattering
to look too surprised.

772
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I'll just be a minute.

773
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,950
I like the lights on.

774
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Then go home and turn them on.

775
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:47,000
Oh. I'm sorry.

776
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Come on.

777
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,950
Dad. Come on, wake up, Dad.

778
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
- What? What?
- Melanie's sick.

779
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
- What?
- Melanie's sick.

780
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
- The baby's sick.
- The baby's sick?

781
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,950
Are you coming, Flap?

782
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
- What do you think's wrong?
- I have to look first.

783
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Come on, Dad.

784
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,950
Thank you.

785
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
You can go to bed.
She's gonna be all right, she is.

786
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:07,000
- I can't sleep.
- Go to bed, I'll be there soon.

787
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,950
We're making this a drama.

788
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It's not going to qualify
as high drama.

789
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:14,000
It's OK, it's OK.

790
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Thanks.

791
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I'm sure it's the croup.

792
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Remember, Tommy had it twice?

793
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Guess you were in the library.

794
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
God, that's the worst
sound in the world.

795
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
How long do you keep her in here?

796
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
- Why? Are you going back to bed?
- I just asked how long.

797
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,950
Well, I don't know.

798
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Until her throat clears or I lose
20 pounds, whichever comes first.

799
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:00,000
I don't know, I don't know.
About 20 minutes, I guess.

800
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I've been offered a job.

801
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
What?
Why didn't you say something?

802
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I wanted to think about it.

803
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
It's head of the English department
at Kearney State College.

804
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,000
About the same money.

805
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:23,000
Oh. Where is it?

806
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:25,000
Nebraska.

807
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,950
I really don't want to move.

808
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I love the school,
the paediatricians...

809
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:37,000
It's the head of the department.

810
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
We'll talk about it, all right?
I like it here, Flap.

811
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Head of the department, that's...
That's great.

812
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Bye.

813
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,950
Come on, Teddy.

814
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Don't kiss the baby,
she may still be sick.

815
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:01,000
Have a good day at school.

816
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,950
Oh, you don't know the night I had!

817
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,500
Melanie decided to get the croup at
3 am and I haven't gotten any sleep.

818
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:22,000
He may be kidding, but Flap says
we're going to some Nebraska college.

819
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:28,000
I'm not sure, but I think
Sam is becoming someone that I need.

820
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,000
I'm lying here next to the astronaut.

821
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:33,000
Are you really?

822
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,950
How was it?

823
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
- I'll speak to you later.
- Oh, I feel so good for you.

824
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:43,000
I do. You call me
as soon as you can.

825
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:45,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

826
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Mel...

827
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
OK, Mel.

828
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I just want to make this clear,
you know.

829
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:01,000
I see other women.

830
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I didn't think we were engaged.

831
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:07,025
- OK, OK.
- Your ego, really!

832
01:12:07,075 --> 01:12:09,950
OK. Let's stay in tonight.

833
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,950
- You're saving a fortune on me.
- I'll cook.

834
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It's been three weeks,
and you haven't even seen my house.

835
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:20,000
My best instincts
had me avoiding it.

836
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
What are you thinking?

837
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I'll tell you what.

838
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,950
I think this is really sad,

839
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
that you feel that you need
all this stuff to impress girls with.

840
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Need it?

841
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Sometimes it isn't enough.

842
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,500
There's nothing wrong
with using your assets.

843
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:59,950
I think it turns your profession
into a sex trap.

844
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,500
Oh, come on. Everybody uses
whatever they have. I earned it!

845
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:09,000
There's 106 astronauts in the
whole world and I'm one of them!

846
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,025
It's a big part of me.

847
01:13:11,075 --> 01:13:12,950
I'm sorry. I didn't...

848
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I didn't mean to trip
on such a deeply felt principle.

849
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Do you want to know what bothers me?

850
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
None of us ever got together
in one room, locked all the doors,

851
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,950
and compared notes
on the experience.

852
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I think we had to pretend
it wasn't the fun that it was.

853
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,950
You do sense the speed.

854
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I remember looking out
the window of the spacecraft...

855
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I sound like somebody with a big
belly telling their Korea stories.

856
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:07,950
Anyway, once I'm
looking out the window.

857
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I see a piece of the spacecraft,
and it's whistling along the ground.

858
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:15,000
It doesn't make a sound.

859
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,000
The only sound you hear,
the only noise in the entire world,

860
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:24,000
is your heart beating.

861
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,950
It's indescribable.

862
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Maybe they can think of a better way
of saying it, but that was it.

863
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
That was my moment,
the one that doesn't go away.

864
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You know what I mean?

865
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Yes.

866
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,950
Hey...

867
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
This is my moment.

868
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
No, don't get nervous, Garrett.

869
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Flap?

870
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Anybody?

871
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
You don't think it's love
because we're having fun.

872
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:48,000
Love can be fun.
Would you stop making faces?

873
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,950
That's wonderful.

874
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,950
What we have here is
a typical grad-school girl crush.

875
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Would you please, please, please
stop telling me this is a crush?

876
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,950
The fun with getting involved
with someone unavailable

877
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and slightly older is sometimes you
get to hear what's really going on.

878
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:14,000
- Flap, you are such a...
- Incredible asshole!

879
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Excuse me.

880
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
- Excuse me.
- Watch it, buddy!

881
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Emma!

882
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
God damn it, Emma, you'll ruin us!

883
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
- Cos you're a spectacle!
- I am not!

884
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Stop jiggling her, she'll throw up.

885
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:43,950
Your timing was perfect.

886
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
You caught us before we did anything.

887
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:50,000
I'm taking the kids to Houston.

888
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,950
Give me the baby.

889
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,950
You don't know what I did,

890
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
just like I don't know what you do
on your afternoon drives.

891
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:05,000
Professor Horton,
can we talk about my grade?

892
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:08,950
You ought to be happy I'm going.

893
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
If I stayed here,
I'd make life hell for you.

894
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,950
Don't follow me.

895
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Excuse me. Excuse me.

896
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Excuse me! Excuse me!

897
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
It's them. It's them!

898
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
- Garrett, come meet Emma.
- No, you don't need outsiders.

899
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:49,000
- You're no outsider!
- I'll see them later.

900
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:50,950
Em, Em, this is Garrett.

901
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Oh! Pleasure to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

902
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:58,000
Your mother's been looking
forward to this, too.

903
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
So, go ahead.

904
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,500
- Anything wrong, Garrett?
- No.

905
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:11,000
It was very nice to have met you.

906
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:13,525
Must be nice to be home.

907
01:18:13,575 --> 01:18:16,000
Oh, it's great. It's great.

908
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,950
I'll be over later.

909
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
They're tired,
and will get to sleep early,

910
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:25,000
and I'd like to get to bed early.

911
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:29,000
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!

912
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:29,950
Bye-bye.

913
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,950
Come on out. All right.
This one likes to squeeze.

914
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Teddy likes to squeeze, Tommy likes
a squeeze. You both get a squeeze.

915
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
The baby. Where's the baby?

916
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Oh, there is my baby.
Look at the baby!

917
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,950
I think she looks a little like you.

918
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
A little? Gee, it's like
looking in the mirror.

919
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
She loved the ride.
She hardly cried at all.

920
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
- Bring in the suitcases.
- OK.

921
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
- Mom...
- Well, I talk to you every day.

922
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,950
- Mother, you look great.
- You look terrible.

923
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Nobody wants a girl
who's washed-out and tired-looking.

924
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,950
I just drove about 1,000 miles.

925
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Besides, all the men
love me the way I am, Mother.

926
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It's like you, when you finally take
one small step away from Flap,

927
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:40,000
it's with a married,
unavailable, older lowan, hmm?

928
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Tell me about the astronaut.

929
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:45,950
We have to talk about it.

930
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Are you going to sleep now,
or are we gonna talk?

931
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
How's the astronaut, Mother?

932
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Really?

933
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Oh, really?

934
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,950
Yes!

935
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
He has a name, though.

936
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:19,000
You really like him.

937
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,950
Yeah.

938
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Well, it's just so...

939
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,950
It's so strange that relatively...

940
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Relatively late in life,
I've found that sex is so...

941
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
so... so...

942
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,950
so...

943
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
.. so fan-fucking-tastic!

944
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Anyway, that's what he calls it.

945
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
A moth to flame.

946
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
This affair is going to kill me.

947
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
No. Maybe not. Why do you say that?

948
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,950
Come on, Mom.

949
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I never thought
I'd start to need him.

950
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
You're so lucky you have a pool.

951
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Come on, stand there. Stand there!

952
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,950
- OK.
- OK.

953
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Let's talk about Los Angeles.
Do you miss it?

954
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
It was so interesting
dating Jews after the divorce.

955
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,500
They are so lively.

956
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:02,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

957
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,950
In Los Angeles, they were so anxious

958
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,500
to show they understood
your secret thoughts.

959
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:11,775
- Patsy!
- And I was just glad I had some.

960
01:22:11,825 --> 01:22:15,000
Honey, there's
a telephone call for you.

961
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Hello.

962
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Oh, hi, Flap. How are you?

963
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I'm fine.

964
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
- I look older, like everyone else.
- She does not.

965
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Flap, you sound the same and I'm not
sure that's such a good thing.

966
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Yeah, she's right here.

967
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
No, we have other things
to talk about besides you.

968
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Hello?

969
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I'm fine.

970
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
What's up? Feeling contrite?

971
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
You don't seem to understand.
I saw you together.

972
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
What?

973
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
You know, Flap, I can't believe
you're doing this to us.

974
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,950
Well, I think you're spiteful,

975
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
and I don't know
when the hell that happened.

976
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
No! Goodbye. I'll... Goodbye.

977
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Flap accepted the job at Kearney,
Nebraska. We're moving in a week.

978
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,950
I don't know why you don't leave him.

979
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Honestly, I don't know, either.
He's cute.

980
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I've been packing for us all week.

981
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Sure remembers her daddy.

982
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,950
So, are you gonna stay mad?

983
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I think being uprooted without my
consent is worth a pout, don't you?

984
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,950
Come on.

985
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
- Head of the department.
- I know.

986
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:36,000
Here.

987
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
- Aurora?
- Garrett! I'm back here.

988
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Well, hello, stranger.

989
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
What's it been, about two days?

990
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Your family still around?

991
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
No, they left.

992
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
What?

993
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
You probably know
what I'm going to say.

994
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Oh, maybe not. I hope not.

995
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,950
Well...

996
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,950
You're some kind of woman,
but I'm the wrong kind of man,

997
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,000
and it doesn't look like my shot
at being the right kind is...

998
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:46,000
as good as I was hoping for.

999
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You don't even know how much
you'll miss me.

1000
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I don't want to blow smoke
up your ass.

1001
01:25:56,050 --> 01:26:00,000
Oh! What a relief.

1002
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It's just that I'm starting
to feel an obligation here.

1003
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:09,000
It makes it rough,
especially living next door.

1004
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I'm starting to think
I gotta watch what I'm doing...

1005
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I... I am gonna miss you...

1006
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
and I do feel bad.

1007
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
You're lucky.

1008
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I feel humiliated.

1009
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,950
Can I have a picture of you?

1010
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Yeah, but the only one I have
has Flap in it.

1011
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I don't mind.

1012
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Come here, give me a kiss.

1013
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
When you finish,
I need this kind of type.

1014
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:16,000
Hello, Emma. Hi, baby.

1015
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
She wanted her daddy
to see her dressed up.

1016
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,950
He'll be here any minute.

1017
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
- I'll talk to you later.
- OK.

1018
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Excuse me.

1019
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Miss?

1020
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Miss?

1021
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Don't make me run after you,
I have a toddler here!

1022
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Are you the reason
that we came to Nebraska?

1023
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I think that Flap should talk to you.

1024
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
We discussed that.

1025
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,950
I don't want to say anything
until he does, except that

1026
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I don't think there's an emotion
you're having I couldn't... validate.

1027
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,950
Tell you what.

1028
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
If you see Flap,
tell him his wife and his baby

1029
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
went to get their flu shots,
all right?

1030
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:52,000
Why don't you do that?

1031
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Just hold still.

1032
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,950
That's a good girl.

1033
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
OK? You're all finished.
It's all over.

1034
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
If it makes you feel any better,
Mommy's getting a shot, too.

1035
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
- Can I give her a pop?
- Sure.

1036
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:15,000
- Here.
- There you go.

1037
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Are they gonna tell me
if my husband calls?

1038
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,950
You have a lump in your armpit.

1039
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
- How long has it been there?
- I don't know.

1040
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:29,000
Melanie, stop kicking the cabinet!

1041
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,950
There's two of them.
It's not very big, though.

1042
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I have to be out of town next week
but you shouldn't wait.

1043
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:37,950
They should come out.

1044
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,950
Come out? Should I be scared?

1045
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:47,000
If you're scared, you'll be happier
when it turns out to be nothing.

1046
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:51,000
Dr Butch, Mom should get a pop, too,
for her shot.

1047
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
- Right. Here, Mom.
- Thanks, Mel.

1048
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,950
Well, I know what it is.

1049
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
You don't keep yourself up
so your sweat glands are clogged.

1050
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,950
- It's a cyst.
- So I shouldn't worry?

1051
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
It's a cyst,
right where your oil glands are.

1052
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,000
You never knew how to eat right
and you've never learned how to wash.

1053
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:14,000
You're right. Thanks.
Talk to Melanie.

1054
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:14,950
- Say hi.
- Hi.

1055
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Hello, how are you?
I sent you a blouse.

1056
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:19,950
- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

1057
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,000
OK. Say good...
Say goodbye to your mother.

1058
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,950
What's her name?

1059
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,950
Janice. What did the doctor say?

1060
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I told you, Flap. It's scary
that he wants to do it so fast.

1061
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:44,950
Janice... with her little folder.

1062
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
"I can't say anything until he does.
We've discussed it, Flap and I."

1063
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:52,525
I mean, really, Flap!
"Validate my feelings. " Your taste!

1064
01:31:52,575 --> 01:31:56,287
What the doctor said,
feeling good when it turns out...

1065
01:31:56,337 --> 01:32:00,000
No! Forget it, I won't make you
feel better, I'm too mad.

1066
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:01,000
Dinner!

1067
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Dear, you have a malignancy.

1068
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
- Say it again?
- Malignancy.

1069
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,500
Rosie... our girl is in trouble.

1070
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,950
She has a cyst that's malignant.

1071
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
They're taking her to a hospital
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

1072
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,950
We'll release her in a few days.

1073
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
We do more and more
on an outpatient basis.

1074
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
We shouldn't need to take her back,
unless the illness escalates.

1075
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:01,000
But you're not telling me anything.

1076
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:04,000
What are you confused about?

1077
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:05,950
How is she?

1078
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I tell people to hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.

1079
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
And they let you get away with that?

1080
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Look, you're wrong to see everything
as so desperate and serious.

1081
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And it won't do your daughter any
good to get those signals, either.

1082
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
What's wrong now?

1083
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I'm so frustrated with that doctor.
But it boils down to this.

1084
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:39,525
You're getting out and
you don't have to stay here again.

1085
01:33:39,575 --> 01:33:43,787
Unless the illness spreads.
I really don't feel sick.

1086
01:33:43,837 --> 01:33:48,000
Hey, Emma. Come to New York
for a visit. My treat.

1087
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Great. We'll have to see.
Look at these letters from the kids.

1088
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:56,000
Teddy says he couldn't sleep,
but Melanie slept fine.

1089
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,500
Tommy thinks there's nothing
to be concerned about...

1090
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:04,000
Hey, I mean it! You have
time before you see the doctor.

1091
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:07,000
Come see New York for a few days.

1092
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
It's not a bad idea,
a vacation by yourself.

1093
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:12,950
Rosie and I are here with the kids.

1094
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,950
- Take advantage of your freedom.
- I know you wanna go.

1095
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:22,000
This isn't like taking those kids
to Disneyland right before the end?

1096
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:23,000
Stop!

1097
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Patsy, I'm kidding!

1098
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,950
Do you feel funny
about leaving the kids?

1099
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I'm not leaving them,
I'm entrusting them to their father.

1100
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Oh, I thought as long as your mother
and Rosie are in town...

1101
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:46,000
Not them. You.

1102
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,950
- Emma, look! Look! Look!
- Are we there yet?

1103
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,950
- Oh, God! I can't believe I'm here!
- Isn't it beautiful?

1104
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I want you to meet some of my
friends. Not friends like you and I.

1105
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,950
- Hi.
- Hi.

1106
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,950
Emma, this is Lizbeth.

1107
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,950
- Hi, Elizabeth.
- Hi. It's Lizbeth.

1108
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
- Isn't that what I said?
- You said "Elizabeth". It's Lizbeth.

1109
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:27,000
- Oh, two names? Liz Beth?
- No, one. Lizbeth.

1110
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:29,000
- Lizbeth?
- Never mind.

1111
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
- And this is Jane.
- Thank heavens!

1112
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,500
Here, that's Melanie.

1113
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:39,950
Oh! Look at that!

1114
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Teddy's the younger one,
Tommy's the older one.

1115
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
- The little girl's incredible.
- Don't think she doesn't know it.

1116
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:52,525
Oh, Patsy's got a real thing
going with her. The boys, too.

1117
01:35:52,575 --> 01:35:56,000
Are you waiting till she's in school
before working again?

1118
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Oh, I never really work.

1119
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Well. That's OK.

1120
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,000
Thanks.

1121
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Great.

1122
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,950
When did she find out?

1123
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
- About a month ago.
- There.

1124
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,950
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1125
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
It was a great honour meeting you,
have a wonderful time.

1126
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:28,950
Thank you.

1127
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Those beautiful children are lucky
to have you for a mommy.

1128
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:35,000
Y'all go ahead, take the first cab.

1129
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:37,525
- Sure?
- Yeah. That's fine.

1130
01:36:37,575 --> 01:36:40,000
- Bye-bye, Patsy.
- See you.

1131
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,000
Bye, darling.

1132
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,000
- You told them, didn't you?
- Yeah, you don't mind, do you?

1133
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:51,000
Of course not.

1134
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Emma, come on. They're jerks.
They don't know anything.

1135
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:58,950
- Why do they act like that?
- Emma, talk to me!

1136
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
It's not you. I don't care.
I don't mind them knowing.

1137
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:11,000
In less than two hours, two of them
told me that they'd had abortions.

1138
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:12,950
Three of them told me
they were divorced.

1139
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,950
One hasn't talked to her mother
in four years.

1140
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
And the one that has little Natalie
in a boarding school

1141
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:22,000
because she has to travel
for her job?

1142
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,950
Hell, Patsy!

1143
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Oh, the one with the yeast disease
that thought she had vaginal herpes?

1144
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:32,950
If that's fit conversation for lunch,

1145
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
what's so god-awful terrible
about my little tumours?

1146
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Yeah, of course, but...
what do you want me to do?

1147
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:45,000
I want you to tell them
it ain't so tragic!

1148
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
People do get better.

1149
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Tell them it's OK
to talk about the cancer!

1150
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Patsy tells us you have cancer.

1151
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,950
We should talk later.

1152
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I'm a nutritionist,
and my husband's with Ticketron.

1153
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,950
Thanks, Patsy.

1154
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
- Hello.
- Flap? Have you heard anything?

1155
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:22,000
No. Emma hasn't
called you either, then, huh?

1156
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:24,525
No. How are the children?

1157
01:38:24,575 --> 01:38:26,950
I wish I were so carefree.

1158
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Yes, well, they don't have
anything to feel ashamed about.

1159
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:35,000
You know something? You always
lose your manners around me.

1160
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:36,950
Stop it, Flap.
Let me know if you hear.

1161
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
If you talk to Emma,
don't sound so frightened.

1162
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:42,000
I don't sound... frightened!

1163
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Daddy.

1164
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Hi, Mother. They're having this party
for me so I can't talk very long.

1165
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
But I think I'm coming home
a few days early.

1166
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Not really.

1167
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,950
It's about time
they gave us this room.

1168
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,950
Mother, I can't believe you did this.
It's great.

1169
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Careful! These are worth more
than you'll make in your lifetime.

1170
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:23,000
I grew up with it, you can take it
for a couple of minutes.

1171
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
This is fine. Thank you so much.

1172
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Thank you.

1173
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,950
Oh, they're wonderful!

1174
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
They look good next to each other.

1175
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Help me with this, Melanie.
Gorgeous isn't everything.

1176
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:53,000
This one, this one... two more.

1177
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
The response to the drugs we tried...

1178
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,950
isn't what we hoped.

1179
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:10,000
There are investigatory drugs
which we are willing to utilise.

1180
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:12,950
However, if you become incapacitated,

1181
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
or it becomes unreasonable for you
to handle your affairs for a time,

1182
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:22,000
it might be wise
to make some decisions now.

1183
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Any questions?

1184
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
No.

1185
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,950
I know what you're saying.

1186
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I have to figure out
what to do with my kids.

1187
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Excuse me. It's after ten.
Give my daughter the pain shot.

1188
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:06,950
Mrs Greenway, I was going to.

1189
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
- Good. Go ahead.
- Just a few minutes.

1190
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:10,950
Please. It's after ten.

1191
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,950
I don't see why
she has to have this pain?

1192
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
- Ma'am, It's not my patient.
- It's time! Do something!

1193
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:20,000
All she has to do is
hold on until ten!

1194
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,950
And it's past ten!
My daughter's in pain!

1195
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
- Give her the shot!
- Are you going to behave?

1196
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:30,000
GIVE MY DAUGHTER THE SHOT!

1197
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1198
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Can I have 222, please?

1199
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
- Let's get her!
- I'm pushing Grandma in!

1200
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Don't you dare! I mean it.

1201
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Come on.

1202
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
- Say, "Hi, Granny. "
- Hi, Granny.

1203
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:23,000
Aurora?

1204
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Well...

1205
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Who would have expected you
to be a nice guy?

1206
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Who?

1207
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
It's good to see you.

1208
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Take care of yourself. I'll call you.

1209
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I'm real glad I came.

1210
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,500
Your coming meant a lot to Emma.

1211
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:48,950
It meant a lot to me, Garrett.

1212
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,950
I'll be at the hospital all the time,
I'll call you.

1213
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
No, if there's someone there, I'll
hear that funny sound in your voice.

1214
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:59,000
I don't care.
Who cares? I don't care.

1215
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:01,000
I'm glad you came, I love you.

1216
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Garrett!

1217
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Garrett!

1218
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:25,000
Come here.

1219
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:29,950
I was curious.

1220
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Do you have any reaction
to my telling you I love you?

1221
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I was just inches
from a clean getaway.

1222
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:41,000
Well, you're stuck, so face it.

1223
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Well, I don't know what else to say
except my stock answer.

1224
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:50,000
Which is?

1225
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I love you, too, kid.

1226
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Goodbye.

1227
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,950
At the airport,
we were standing there

1228
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
in front of the door hugging
and kissing, and saying goodbye.

1229
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:33,950
- And you know what?
- What?

1230
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I got up the nerve
to tell him I loved him.

1231
01:45:38,050 --> 01:45:40,525
You know what his reaction was?

1232
01:45:40,575 --> 01:45:43,000
I don't give a shit, Mom, I'm sick.

1233
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Not everything is about you,
I've got a lot to figure out.

1234
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
- I just don't wanna fight any more.
- What do you mean? When do we fight?

1235
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
When do we fight? You amaze me.

1236
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:05,000
I always think of us as fighting.

1237
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:06,950
That's from your end.

1238
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
That's cos you're
never satisfied with me.

1239
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,950
- Have you seen her yet today?
- Yes.

1240
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I've been with her most of
last night and today, as usual.

1241
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I haven't, uh...
really talked to the kids yet.

1242
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,950
I'm not sure how much they realise,

1243
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
but they know
something bad's happening.

1244
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:30,950
Flap...

1245
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Patsy wants to raise Melanie

1246
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:34,950
and maybe the boys.

1247
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I think they should be with me,
don't you?

1248
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
What can you be thinking about?

1249
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Raising three children,
working full time and chasing women

1250
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,950
requires a lot more energy
than you have.

1251
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
You know, one of the
nicest qualities about you

1252
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:52,950
is that you recognise
your weaknesses.

1253
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Don't lose that quality
when you need it the most.

1254
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
You have no right,
nor any invitation,

1255
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,000
to discuss where
or how my children live.

1256
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
From what the doctor says,
it's time that we have the talk now.

1257
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Do you know how much I hate
the idea of losing you?

1258
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,950
Yes.

1259
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Well, nobody...
Nobody seems to know that except you.

1260
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I... Well...

1261
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:52,000
What?

1262
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I'm thinking about my identity,
and not having one any more.

1263
01:48:57,050 --> 01:48:59,950
Who am I, if I'm not the man
who's failing Emma?

1264
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,950
- You didn't fail me, Flap.
- I don't wanna discuss it.

1265
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I feel like I'm sucking after
forgiveness, which I probably am.

1266
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
You were no more terrible than I was.

1267
01:49:11,050 --> 01:49:13,000
Except for the cheating.

1268
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
You're right. Let's not do this.

1269
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,950
Look, we had problems.

1270
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,000
It was never over
whether we loved each other.

1271
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,950
Oh, God! That tie!

1272
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,950
I can't believe you wore that!

1273
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
The mess it must've been finding it.

1274
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
The house still isn't in one piece.
It was in the last box I looked in.

1275
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:43,000
I'll bet.

1276
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,950
God, you're easy to please.

1277
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I don't know why
I couldn't do more of it.

1278
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
I'm so glad we're talking, I just am.

1279
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
It just means so much to me that
we can still feel like this, so much.

1280
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:01,000
I swear...

1281
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Listen, I am getting tired.

1282
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Just tell me, hon,
you really want to raise 'em?

1283
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I never thought I was the sort of man
who'd give up his kids.

1284
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:31,000
It's a lot of work.

1285
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
As hard as you think it is,
you end up wishing it were that easy.

1286
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,950
Where do you want them?

1287
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I don't want them
to end up with Janice.

1288
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Well, she's not so bad.

1289
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I really don't think
they should be with you, honey.

1290
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Well...

1291
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
To tell you the honest truth...

1292
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I'd probably screw it up.

1293
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I'll really miss them.

1294
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Well, maybe we should let
Patsy take them.

1295
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,500
It'd be easy for me to work
research summers in New York.

1296
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:35,000
No. Patsy really only wants Melanie.
Mother should have them.

1297
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,950
You can see them any time you want.

1298
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
You'll decide things
for them and everything.

1299
01:51:42,050 --> 01:51:44,000
She can make that very difficult.

1300
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:46,000
She won't.

1301
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Well, I guess they should be
with your mother.

1302
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I probably have that coming.

1303
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Flap, will you bring
the boys by tomorrow?

1304
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I've got that one waiting for me.
I gotta do it.

1305
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

1306
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Come on, Pats, I gotta get ready.

1307
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:41,000
Patsy. Make-up!

1308
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Is it terrible to say
I can't stand seeing your mother

1309
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:49,950
get her hands on that little girl?

1310
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I'd just love to raise
that little girl.

1311
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,950
Look, I'd let you,

1312
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
but Teddy couldn't spare her.

1313
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,950
I can't stall any more, all right?

1314
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
You go out there
and send the boys in.

1315
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:12,000
Well, do I get to say something ever?

1316
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:13,000
No.

1317
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
We don't have to do that, right?
Come here.

1318
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
You'll be fine. You will.

1319
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
It's just this...

1320
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
You're my touchstone, Emma.

1321
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
The boys.

1322
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,950
Hi. Come on.

1323
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I love you. I miss you.
God, I want you to come home.

1324
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,950
Close the door.

1325
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
God, you both look so gigantic to me.

1326
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I guess I look pretty bad to you.

1327
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:44,000
Not so bad.

1328
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
You both have beautiful eyes
and your hair's too long.

1329
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I don't care about the back
but keep your bangs cut, OK?

1330
01:54:55,050 --> 01:54:58,000
- It's too long.
- That's a matter of opinion.

1331
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:01,000
Just keep it short, all right?

1332
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:03,000
Are you getting well?

1333
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:07,950
Look up.

1334
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I'm sorry about this
but I can't help it.

1335
01:55:11,050 --> 01:55:14,000
I can't talk too long
or I'll get real upset.

1336
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,950
I want you to make a lot of friends.

1337
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And be real nice to the girls cos
they'll be important to you, I swear.

1338
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
We're not afraid of girls,
what makes you think that?

1339
01:55:29,050 --> 01:55:31,950
- Well, you may be later on.
- I doubt it.

1340
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
- Why don't you shut up? Shut up!
- You shut up.

1341
01:55:35,050 --> 01:55:38,000
Teddy, give me a kiss, come on.

1342
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Tommy, you be sweet. Be sweet.

1343
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And stop trying to pretend
like you hate me. It's silly.

1344
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,950
I like you.

1345
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
- Then listen especially close.
- What?

1346
01:55:56,050 --> 01:55:58,000
- Listen real hard?
- I said what.

1347
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I know you like me. I know it.

1348
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
For the last year or two,
you've pretended like you hate me.

1349
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
But I love you very much,
as much as I love anybody,

1350
01:56:15,050 --> 01:56:16,950
as much as I love myself.

1351
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:22,000
And in a few years when I haven't
been around to irritate you,

1352
01:56:22,050 --> 01:56:23,950
you're gonna remember.

1353
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,000
You'll remember when I bought the
baseball glove when we were broke

1354
01:56:29,050 --> 01:56:31,000
or when I read you those stories,

1355
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
or when I let you goof off instead
of mowing the lawn, lots of things.

1356
01:56:36,050 --> 01:56:39,950
You're gonna realise
that you love me,

1357
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
and maybe you'll feel badly because
you never told me, but don't.

1358
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I know that you love me.

1359
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
- So don't do that to yourself, OK?
- OK!

1360
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
- OK?
- I said OK.

1361
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
OK, you two should run along.

1362
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:06,000
Take care.

1363
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Give me a kiss.

1364
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I was so scared,
but I think it went well, don't you?

1365
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Yeah?

1366
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Tommy, if you need to talk,
your dad will listen.

1367
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
He's a very smart man, you know.

1368
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Just say, "Dad, I'm confused.
I need to have a talk. "

1369
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,000
You know, I met this boy back in
River Oaks where I live.

1370
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:55,000
He said the Cub Scouts in Houston
are the best ever.

1371
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,000
We were never scouts, our mother
was too lazy to check it out.

1372
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
No! Stop!

1373
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Come on! Stop it!

1374
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:07,950
No!

1375
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Listen to me! Listen. It's OK, Tom.

1376
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
It's OK. Now...
Hey! Stop it!

1377
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I'm sorry, but I just can't have you
criticising your mother around me.

1378
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Mr Horton. Mr Horton?

1379
01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:35,000
She's gone.

1380
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Oh, God, I'm so stupid. So stupid...

1381
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:05,950
Somehow I thought...

1382
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Somehow I thought
when she finally went,

1383
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:12,000
that it would be a relief.

1384
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Oh, my sweet, little darling!

1385
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Oh, dear. There's nothing harder.
There's nothing...

1386
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Do you want some cake?

1387
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
- Why are you standing over here?
- I don't know.

1388
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
You wanna come over and sit with me?

1389
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Everything's gonna be
all right, Tommy.

1390
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:33,000
There's fantastic
dance schools in Houston.

1391
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,000
- Tap?
- Tap, ballet, aerobics...

1392
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,950
Anything you want.

1393
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,950
Come over here and see your dad.

1394
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,000
He really knows a pretty girl,
doesn't he?

1395
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,950
She's too old for him.

1396
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Are you eating a wet bunny? Here.
Better go on over to Dad and eat it.

1397
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Hi, Vern. How are you doing here?

1398
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Hi.

1399
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
I understand you're a swimmer.

1400
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,950
Me, too.

1401
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
But you're an astronaut, right?

1402
02:02:43,050 --> 02:02:46,000
I'm an astronaut and a swimmer.

1403
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Pretty good-looking suit, there.

1404
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
A little closer. A little closer.

1405
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
A little closer.

1406
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Do you want to see my pool?

1407
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I don't know if the time is right.
You know, funeral and everything.

1408
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,950
Oh, I think it is. Come on.

1409
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I'll show you the internationally
infamous... uh... Breedlove crawl.

1410
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Just a little stroke
I picked up out in space.
