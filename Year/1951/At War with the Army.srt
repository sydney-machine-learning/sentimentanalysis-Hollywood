1
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:37,798
War. Total war.
A struggle for survival.

2
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,510
In this era of force and destruction...

3
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,971
...historians will argue. What
was the most influential factor.

4
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:49,119
What was the most deadly instrument?
The most deadly weapon?

5
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:54,659
Was it the overwhelming manpower?
Was it the blistering fire of the rockets?

6
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,575
Was it the thundering mail from heaven?
The bombs, the blockbusters?

7
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,260
Was it the lightning like descension
of the silent parachute?

8
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:20,960
Was it the whithering stutter of the
light machine-gun?

9
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:23,450
Or the spectacle from the
commanding troops?

10
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:31,086
Or is it the prival juggernaut
the Patton tank?

11
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:33,772
Was it the flame-thrower?

12
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:41,097
Or was it the screaming anger of faster
than sound, quicker than this: B-2 rocket?

13
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:46,328
No! It was none of these things.
The most effective, the most deadly...

14
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:49,294
The most terrifying
weapon of all time was.

15
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:52,946
Yes, you're right.
The sergeant's whistle.

16
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,767
All right you guys, now I'm gonna
tell you something.

17
00:02:56,773 --> 00:03:02,078
Well, the Colonel is coming, see? And
as usual the Colonel ain't very happy.

18
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,965
And I ain't very happy either.
Look at this joint.

19
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:09,671
It looks like Coney
Island on a Monday morning.

20
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:12,214
- Hi Sarge, what's the action?
- Have you seen Corwin?

21
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,956
Yeah, I seen him, but
I couldn't take him

22
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:16,385
so I sent him over to
the mess hall. He's on KP.

23
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:18,799
- Okay, take them away.
- Right Sarge.

24
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:23,611
All right my friends. I want
you to fall out, spread out,

25
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:27,753
and pick up everything that
ain't growing or nailed down.

26
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:59,362
Alright let's go.
Can I have some food?

27
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,433
Come on, come on.
Well, let's have it.

28
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:04,205
- What are they gripping about?
- Well, they've got to eat them.

29
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,953
Well, I've got to cook them.

30
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:06,865
Let's get out of here, it's the Sarge.

31
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,468
- What do you think you're
cooking around here?
- Beans?

32
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:20,351
Oh shut up!

33
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,283
You've been getting away with
murder, and it's got to stop.

34
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:24,041
You understand?
Shut up!

35
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:26,685
Just because we were friends
before and used to work together,

36
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:27,879
I've been covering up for you.

37
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:30,666
That's gotta stop too. Do you
understand? Shut up!

38
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:33,228
Now get your pack and
everything that goes with it.

39
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,400
I want to see you down front
in exactly 5 minutes. Understand?

40
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:37,371
Shut up!

41
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,395
You're going to go
on a long, long journey

42
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:41,299
and you may not be back
this way, you understand?

43
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,442
Shut up!

44
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,388
Get to packing, everything goes
with it, be down there in 5 minutes.
Understand. Shut up!

45
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,547
Going on a long, long trip, you may
not be back this way. Shut up!

46
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,198
Shut up!
Shut up!

47
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:01,243
He's going to under AR 605-300...

48
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:05,225
before the CO can get him on
a 104 and 107 article loophole.

49
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:08,976
Now the record goes on
a WVAGO form 20 and 24.

50
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,295
He could be eligible for a 615-360.

51
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:14,050
Section 7, paragraph 49.

52
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,786
Oh sure, I get it.

53
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:28,333
Sure and an MR19-2, his profile
is 24.4.4.4D.

54
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:31,723
Oh brother, I ain't in the army,
I'm back in the numbers racket.

55
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,174
Here's your mail Corporal.

56
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:37,681
Well, guess I'll take another crack at
that bandit. Do you think it will work?

57
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:40,020
It should. There was a guy in
here a while ago who fixed it.

58
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:41,508
Bout time.

59
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,974
How do you like that? Now you
don't even get the nickel back.

60
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:55,066
Crazy army. I asked
for a transfer again

61
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,393
and they throw me right out
of the Italian headquarters.

62
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:02,282
Shaughnessy, how many times do I have
to tell you, this ain't a day room.

63
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:03,540
Alright, sir.

64
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:06,126
- Got a cigarette?
- Yeah, here.

65
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,764
- Tell Sergeant McVey I want
to see him right away.
- Right!

66
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:10,440
- Is Miller in?
- Yeah.

67
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,678
Hey Miller, what do you think
we've got here? Midgets?

68
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,090
Captain, what about this
training film tomorrow morning?

69
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:28,300
Oh yes... that begins at 7 o'clock.

70
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:32,620
Now the theater's 2 blocks away so I
think we'd better fall out at 6:35.

71
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,217
They'll want us in front of
the battlelion headquarters.

72
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:36,157
Not later than 6:25.

73
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:39,127
In that case Davenport, have the
men lined up and ready to go

74
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,556
- at... 6:15.
- Roger.

75
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:43,415
I'll take care of that, sir.
Right away!

76
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:47,182
Oh, Lieutenant.
One more thing.

77
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:49,716
Make sure...

78
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,377
Look what they gave Miller to issue
to every man in the company.

79
00:09:58,378 --> 00:09:59,674
Bullet proof underwear!

80
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,077
- You know what that means, don't you?
- Sure. South Pacific.

81
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,521
Sgt Puccinelli.
As you were.

82
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:15,481
Now Sergeant, we have a special
movie tomorrow morning and

83
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,248
I want the men to be in uniform and

84
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,076
- ready to fall out at 10 minutes past 6.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:24,080
Oh,er, just one more thing, Sergeant.

86
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:28,086
Just to make sure, you better have
the men fall out at 5 minutes past 6.

87
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,287
Yes, sir.

88
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:41,263
Hey Sarge, that guy is lost again.

89
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:44,281
Well, you'd better find him.
- Right Sarge.

90
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:51,340
Hey, you see them lights?
You see that sign?

91
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:53,393
Let's be turning them off.

92
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,808
Sergeant McVey, we've got
to see the work, don't we?

93
00:10:56,843 --> 00:11:01,307
Yeah, what if Colonel Davis comes?
He don't like lights on in the daytime.

94
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,308
Another thing McVey, the company
has an early formation tomorrow and

95
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,202
you'd better have those men
fall out at 5 minutes before 6.

96
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:11,984
- 5 minutes before 6 huh?
- Yeah.

97
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:15,451
I tell you, I've got some names here
that are cock-a-may-mes.

98
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:21,023
Rodowsky, Smellywesh...
Keselioshmiasch.

99
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:24,483
Let me pull them out early,
say about 5:45 huh?

100
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,766
- Okay.
- Right Sarge.

101
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:32,506
Some day this guy is going
to blow his brains out.

102
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:34,674
If you ask me, he's already done it.

103
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,780
Yes sir. Yes Captain.

104
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:11,533
Yes sir!

105
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,298
See the first Sergeant in the other
room.

106
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:56,210
Go around the outside.
Through that door.

107
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,275
That door.

108
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,807
I said that door.

109
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:04,345
- Got a cigarette?
- No, I quit. Can't afford it.

110
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:12,269
There you are.
Where've you been?

111
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,327
Fine looking specimen you are.
Get over there.

112
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:18,048
Look at you!
Look at this!

113
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:21,278
Fix the helmet. Now get out
on the parade grounds.

114
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,936
Ten times round.
Double time. Understand?

115
00:14:23,955 --> 00:14:26,901
Then come back here. I've got
plans for you.

116
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:31,249
Go on, get the lead out of your bucket.

117
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:33,763
Wait a minute. Come here.

118
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,732
Got a cigarette?

119
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:56,055
- I've been arguing with him again.
- Oh yeah?

120
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,031
I don't dig this army at all.
I want overseas...

121
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:02,938
I stay here. The guys don't want
to stay here, get overseas.

122
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:06,334
- You forget, there's a war on.
- Yeah, but what do we get to do about it?

123
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:08,716
When I was a civilian, we had
something going every minute.

124
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:10,657
Singing, dancing, working in nightclubs.

125
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:12,982
I join the army, I sit on my hands.

126
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:17,880
I'm hungry. Think I'll
inspect the mess hall.

127
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,934
- Hi ya Sarge. Been waiting up for me?
- How come you're late Edwards?

128
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:25,363
I was drunk.

129
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:28,420
I don't blame you. With a kisser
like that, I'd be loaded all the time.

130
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,646
Why thank you.

131
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:31,516
You're welcome, now go to
your barracks Edwards,

132
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:33,450
get into your fatigues
and report back here.

133
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,188
And if you have any social engagements,

134
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:37,296
call your secretary
and have her cancel them.

135
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,102
Sergeant's real brave today.

136
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:46,600
I get any mail?

137
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,410
Sure took you a long time to sober up.

138
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:53,301
Took me a long time to get drunk.

139
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,168
My new girl had a date with
another Joe last night.

140
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,309
What's the matter, losing your appeal?

141
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,221
Does that look like
I'm losing my appeal?

142
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,401
Wow! Very tasty.

143
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:17,703
Hello.

144
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,414
Hello.

145
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:22,821
- Is Sergeant Puccinelli in?
- No, he's out.

146
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:24,563
What did you want
to see him about?

147
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:27,317
It's of a rather personal nature.

148
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,890
Oh, would you like to leave a message?

149
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:33,374
Yes, just tell him Nelly was here.

150
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:35,344
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

151
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,899
On second thought, do you mind
if I sit here and wait for a while.

152
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:43,903
- No no, go right ahead.
- Thanks.

153
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,859
Clark, do you have that field...

154
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:51,194
manual?

155
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:13,913
I want four copies of this Clark.
It's to go to the adjutant.

156
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:17,875
- But sir, I did this yesterday.
- Oh you did?

157
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:18,783
Yes sir.

158
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:23,815
So you did.
Well, I want one more copy.

159
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,951
Yes, sir.

160
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:28,070
You know, it takes a fantastic
amount of paperwork to administer

161
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:31,259
even a little tank company,
such as we have here.

162
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,947
Are you ready Ernie?

163
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:36,738
Not yet dear.
I'll be right with you.

164
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:39,527
I've decided we can do
without another copy of this.

165
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:46,238
- That's our commanding officer.
- Which one?

166
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:51,762
Who in the company is
that girl married to?

167
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:54,932
I don't know dear.
Shall we call the detectives?

168
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,192
Now darling, don't get testy.

169
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:59,841
I just happen to know that
she's the tidiest little girl,

170
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:02,330
she works on the post,
she has a calcium deficiency,

171
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:03,830
and she's expecting.

172
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,944
Expecting?

173
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:07,622
Yes, and don't ask me
what she's expecting.

174
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:10,933
Where in the world did you uncover
all of this, Mrs. Sherlock Holmes?

175
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:12,317
At the clinic yesterday.

176
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,086
I was there for my cold shot and
one of the nurses told me about her.

177
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:20,786
Say, I just remembered, there's
been a mix-up in the OD roster.

178
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:24,025
- I know.
- I may get it.

179
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:27,811
No you won't. Lt. Terray is stuck
as officer of the day.

180
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:29,387
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

181
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:33,990
Sally Pearson told me, that the
adjutant's wife told her, that the
adjutant said so at noon.

182
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:37,320
Oh well, if Sally said so, that settles it.

183
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:45,799
How are you getting along with
Colonel Davis?

184
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:49,423
Well, that depends. How are you
getting along with Mrs. Davis?

185
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:52,791
That woman! She's
so rank-conscience.

186
00:18:53,936 --> 00:18:55,494
How soon will you be ready to leave?

187
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,345
Why don't you go to the club and
wait. I have a lot of papers to sign.

188
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:03,076
- Can't someone else sign those?
- I'm the only one.

189
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:06,784
The United States Army has high
regard for my signature.

190
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:09,252
I wish The First National Bank did.

191
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:20,330
Where'd you get these clothes
Sergeant?

192
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,978
Quarter master sir.

193
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,414
And why didn't you get a shipping
ticket when you got the clothes?

194
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,266
I don't know sir.

195
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:33,268
Maybe they weren't paying
attention when I drew the issue?

196
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:37,308
Then this is stolen goods.

197
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:39,065
No sir.

198
00:19:39,163 --> 00:19:41,860
I think I'll have to have a
look at army regulations.

199
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:44,058
But Lt. Davenport, don't you trust me?

200
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:47,535
This is no way to run a business.
Carry on.

201
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:01,465
He's going to tell me
how to run a business.

202
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:04,368
He used to be a soda-jerk.
He just ran out of soda.

203
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:08,700
- I got to see the First Sergeant.
- Hi ya kid. I see you're still wearing
your old hat.

204
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:10,704
You leave me alone.
I got troubles.

205
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:12,039
In the army?
You got troubles?

206
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,502
Yeah, and I gotta see the First
Sergeant right away! It's important.

207
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,413
Take it easy...

208
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,854
Don't tell me how to take it.
I got to get a three-day pass.

209
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:22,905
Last guy in the army that got a
three-day pass, was Sergeant York.

210
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:25,665
Yeah, well I don't care. I got to see
my wife. It's an emergency.

211
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:28,514
I've had emergencies,
but could I get a pass?

212
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:30,263
Bet you were never having a baby.

213
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:33,101
Kid, I've never even
had my appendix out.

214
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:36,621
- Corwin!
- Yes sir.

215
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,372
- Did you do those penalty tours?
- Yes Corporal.

216
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:41,002
- Did you report to the drill Sergeant?
- Yes Corporal.

217
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:43,291
- Did you report to the mess Sergeant?
- Yes Corporal.

218
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,218
Okay.

219
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:48,014
Boy, if I ever get overseas, the first
thing I'm gonna do is surrender.

220
00:20:48,124 --> 00:20:50,135
Concentration camps have got to
be better than this.

221
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:55,350
What crummy coffee. Why I
wouldn't wash my...

222
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:57,198
Hey! It's here, the shipping order.

223
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,614
- Came while you were out.
- Now watch me get out of this hole.

224
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:01,763
- Hey Sarge, I wanna...
- What do you want?

225
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:03,414
Nothing. I just thought that maybe I...

226
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:05,461
Get out of my way.
Can't you see I'm busy?

227
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:10,548
Captain Caldwell, I've just seen the
shipping orders and I have just the
man for you sir.

228
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,525
Good. Who is he?

229
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:13,519
Me!
First Sergeant Victor Puccinelli.

230
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:15,359
Don't be foolish Sergeant.

231
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:20,255
This call is only for Privates and
PFC's. You'd better make up your
mind, you're staying here.

232
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,010
- I've seen army...
- I won't argue that point.

233
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,113
Now, about this shipment. We can't
be expected to cripple ourselves, so...

234
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:29,907
...don't send anyone who is useful.

235
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:32,643
How about that kid who never
does anything right?

236
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:34,761
- You mean Corwin?
- That's the one.

237
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,324
He's right out here now sir.

238
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,789
Maybe Eisenhower can do
something with him.

239
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:40,877
Yes sir.

240
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,282
Corwin!

241
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:47,474
- I want to see you.
- I've been wanting to see you too Vic.

242
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:48,400
I wanted to know if I...

243
00:21:48,497 --> 00:21:50,798
Get you hands off my desk and call
me Sergeant.

244
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,655
- Can't you stand up?
- Yes Sergeant.

245
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:57,240
I just wanted to know if I could get a
three-day pass.

246
00:21:58,024 --> 00:21:59,152
What'd you say?

247
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:01,293
I want to know if I can get a three-
day pass?

248
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,965
Did you get permission from your
platoon Sergeant to come in here?

249
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:05,158
No, Sergeant, but I...

250
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,937
How many times must I tell you that
in the army you must go through channels.

251
00:22:08,138 --> 00:22:11,177
I know, but this is an emergency and
if I go through the section leader and

252
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:14,078
the platoon sergeant and you
and the CO and everybody else,

253
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,545
...my kid will be old enough
to be drafted himself.

254
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:18,482
Very funny.

255
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:21,249
I can't be giving you a three-day
pass every week.

256
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:22,682
You just came off one.

257
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,963
That's not true. I haven't been on
one in a long time.

258
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:27,802
And if my wife forgets what I look
like, you'll be responsible.

259
00:22:27,837 --> 00:22:31,609
You should get that lucky. We'll see
about it when the time comes.

260
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,163
- You heard me.
- Yes Sergeant.

261
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:35,893
Aren't we going to rehearse
our act for the show?

262
00:22:35,894 --> 00:22:37,194
Oh get going.

263
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,991
Wait a minute.
Come here.

264
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:42,845
How come you didn't shave today?

265
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:46,398
No one said I was suppose to. I didn't
shave yesterday and nobody said nothing.

266
00:22:46,676 --> 00:22:48,380
Get out of here.

267
00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:52,797
You always didn't use
to treat me like this.

268
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,626
Oh stop mumbling.

269
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:56,848
You always didn't use to treat me
like this, that's what I said, so there so.

270
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:59,452
- Are you going to start that again?
- Yes, I am.

271
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:01,059
You're suppose to be my friend.

272
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,598
We lived on the same block, in the
same city.

273
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,180
And you know what you
promised my mother.

274
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:07,872
Stop hitting my desk. And what
did I promise your mother?

275
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:09,644
That no one would
harm a hair on my head.

276
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,729
You mean both heads.

277
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:12,712
Ho, ho! That's rich!

278
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:15,401
Oh quiet pea-head. Just because
we were friends before...

279
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:16,789
Friends before is right.

280
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,563
Anything to do with now.

281
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,592
I have a responsibility
and you're part of it.

282
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,216
I'm warning you,
you're driving me crazy.

283
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:23,940
That's no drive, that's a short putt.

284
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:27,116
Ah what do you want?
Special privileges?

285
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,889
No, I just want to remember you
as the best man at my wedding.

286
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,042
You're not kidding.

287
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,364
And we were buddies, and we wrote songs,
and we sang and we danced together.

288
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,446
And you still owe me 8 dollars and
75 cents, from before the war.

289
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:40,102
And we was friends and family.
We was just like brother and sister.

290
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,813
And what happens? Along comes a
crummy little war and clip-clap,

291
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:44,625
you turn into a Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Clyde.

292
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:46,137
What is it with you anyhow?

293
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:50,380
- Alright... alright...
- Alright... alright... Big man!

294
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:52,950
Couple of stinking stripes. Big deal!

295
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:56,658
- Go home and wash your face.
- Go home and wash your face.

296
00:23:56,891 --> 00:24:00,110
Big deal. Look at him,
General Delivery.

297
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:02,230
Get out of here.

298
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:06,363
What's the matter with Einstein?

299
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:08,008
He thinks I bombed Pearl Harbour.

300
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:10,937
When Edwards comes back, tell
him he's being shipped out.

301
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:12,984
Say, there was a
Millie here looking for you.

302
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:13,843
Millie?

303
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,196
Wonder what she wants?
Oh, what's the date?

304
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:18,679
- 29th.
- That's it!

305
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,590
Tomorrow is the
anniversary of our first alert.

306
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,602
Alert?
This office has never been alerted.

307
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:25,138
I know.
I just used it as a gag.

308
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:28,047
You know the first time I saw Nelly,
she looked real good to me.

309
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:29,994
- But all I got was ice-cubes.
- So?

310
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:33,446
- So I told her we were being alerted.
- So?

311
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:34,994
So she let me kiss her.

312
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:36,410
So?

313
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:39,314
- So, I took her out a few more times.
- So?

314
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:42,369
- So, she let me kiss her a few more times.
- What's wrong with that?

315
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,126
Nothing, expect one day she started to talk
and I found out how dumb she was.

316
00:24:46,664 --> 00:24:48,876
You know that dame is
really 60 cents short.

317
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,531
Not only that.
She got on a getting-married kick.

318
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,963
What is it with these dames?
They all want to get married?

319
00:24:55,106 --> 00:24:57,122
I know a lot of nice people that
aren't married.

320
00:24:57,157 --> 00:24:59,110
Then one night I took her out...

321
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:06,276
Yes sir! Yes sir! Right sir!

322
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,428
After you tell Edwards he's being
shipped out, send him in to see Miller...

323
00:25:10,432 --> 00:25:13,104
- and have his supply record checked out.
- Right.

324
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:34,663
Hello! You're that cute Corporal that
was here when I came before, aren't you?

325
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,502
Yes, but the Sergeant Puccinelli
still isn't in.

326
00:25:38,077 --> 00:25:42,912
I don't suppose you know if he's going
to stay in camp tonight or tomorrow night?

327
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:45,508
No you see, we never know when
we're going to be alerted.

328
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:47,086
I know.

329
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:51,038
Ours is not the reason why.
Ours but to do or die.

330
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,517
That's cute.

331
00:25:53,032 --> 00:25:55,532
Look, why don't you write him a note.

332
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:59,796
Write him? Well, you do it.

333
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:05,164
Just say: I'll be back at 6:45
when I get off from work.

334
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:07,691
And put down it's important.

335
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:11,994
And if I don't see him,
there might be trouble.

336
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:18,072
Okay. If I see him. You know, he's
not the easiest guy in the world to locate.

337
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:20,073
Don't I know it.

338
00:26:20,265 --> 00:26:25,582
Well, I have to get back to the PX.
We're terribly busy today, we're closed.

339
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,667
Closed for inventory.

340
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:31,484
Good-bye.

341
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:36,610
Well, they did it again.

342
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,338
The adjutant just stuck me with
Officer of the Day.

343
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:41,468
- I know.
- You know?

344
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:44,546
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
- My wife just told me.

345
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:47,504
Did she also mention when the war
would be over?

346
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,993
She doesn't tell me
everything she knows.

347
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:58,959
- Clark?
- It's okay. She's gone.

348
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:01,650
What did Millie have to say?

349
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:04,014
She left you a note.
She said she'd be back 6:45.

350
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:06,290
Come in.

351
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:07,581
No.

352
00:27:07,698 --> 00:27:10,212
- But Sergeant!
- You got permission to come in here?

353
00:27:11,343 --> 00:27:13,153
- No.
- Well get out.

354
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:16,096
They think all I have to do
around here is hand out passes.

355
00:27:16,097 --> 00:27:17,302
What was I talking about?

356
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:20,530
Millie. She said if she doesn't see
you tonight, there's going to be trouble.

357
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,231
I'd better catch the first bus into town.

358
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,704
Hey Corporal.
Would you know where I can...?

359
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:27,764
Hey! Douse them lights.
The Colonel's coming.

360
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:31,299
The offices too.

361
00:27:35,123 --> 00:27:37,857
Hey! Oh, I'm sorry sir,
but the Colonel is coming

362
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,906
and you know how he feels
about lights burning in the daytime.

363
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:42,430
- And you know how I feel about it.
- Yes, I do sir.

364
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:53,033
- All clear.
- Okay, turn them on.

365
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:55,863
Hey, where's Corwin?

366
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:58,227
He's been running in and out
of here all day long,

367
00:27:58,228 --> 00:28:00,253
and if it keeps up, we're going
to have to put in a revolving door.

368
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:02,346
Well, has he got
permission to skip training?

369
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,494
No and you'd better find him and
we'll send him to the CO.

370
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:05,531
Right Sarge!

371
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:07,670
And another thing. Edwards and
these guys are shipping overseas.

372
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:09,843
Come in.

373
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:11,399
Come in.

374
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:14,694
- Get out of here.
- Come back here.

375
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,129
You need to be explaining why you
haven't been in no classes this afternoon.

376
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:22,889
- I've been looking all over for you McVey.
- Oh, you've been looking for me huh?

377
00:28:22,924 --> 00:28:25,084
Yeah, can I have permission to see
the first Sergeant?

378
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:25,840
No!

379
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:28,920
- But I gotta see him.
- You don't gotta see nobody!

380
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:31,819
I've got a message for the first
Sergeant from battalion headquarters.

381
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:33,989
- Why didn't you say so?
- He didn't allow me.

382
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:35,212
Corwin, will you never learn?

383
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:39,600
You know, before you take off on
detail, you gotta tell your platoon Sergeant.

384
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,547
All right!
What's the message?

385
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:50,676
It says you gotta report to the dispensary
in the morning for a physical examination.

386
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,321
Physical!?
Let me see that.

387
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:54,695
My application for ** went through.

388
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:56,088
Hey Sarge, you need me for anything?

389
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:58,044
No, take two weeks off.

390
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:04,508
Wait a minute Sarge. Form 38 is
filled out in case of discharge.

391
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,036
- Discharge? What does that mean?
- Oh he's right Sergeant.

392
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:13,774
According to paragraph 8, article
40-100, 24 hours prior to discharge
of an enlisted man,

393
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:19,554
for reasons other than physical disability,
he must be examined and form 38 filled out.

394
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:21,972
They can't do this to me.

395
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:23,733
- Sergeant!
- What?

396
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,237
When you get home,
will you call my mother?

397
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,735
Oh, get out of here.

398
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:30,338
I'll refuse. I'll go in and tap his head
with a 4x4.

399
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:34,300
Captain Corwin, can you tell me
about this? They want to discharge me.

400
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:35,900
Me ** for that crazy.

401
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:38,501
- Now Sarge.
- Go ahead and read it for yourself.

402
00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:43,300
Sergeant Puccinelli, Nelly will be...

403
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:44,313
No, no, no

404
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:54,028
WDA... Form 30...

405
00:29:55,264 --> 00:30:00,241
Oh calm yourself Sergeant. Your application
for warrant-officer has come through.

406
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:03,674
You're being discharged to accept
the appointment as warrant-officer.

407
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:05,589
Me an officer?
Well, that's worse.

408
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,458
- Sergeant.
- Yes sir?

409
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,535
Will you make out tomorrow's
morning report and send it to battalion.

410
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,765
Morning report tonight?

411
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:16,537
Yes, from now on, they want it in
the night before.

412
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:24,456
- It's a discharge, so I can
become a warrant-officer.
- Congratulations!

413
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:28,040
Hey what's this deal about me
shipping out?

414
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:31,059
There's no deal. You're just on a movement.
You'll be leaving in a couple of days.

415
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:34,320
Look Sarge. How about crossing
my name off that list?

416
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:36,938
You know, I've got a new girl in
town and we're pretty serious.

417
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:39,489
- That's right, touching.
- Listen, I've got to see my girl.

418
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:42,231
I've seen the girls you go with.
You'll do better where you are going.

419
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:44,410
Yeah?
Well, I've seen your type too.

420
00:30:44,412 --> 00:30:46,927
Why don't you drop down to
Rialto theater sometime?

421
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:48,796
- Rial?
- Yeah, the new red-headed usher.

422
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,383
- Helen?
- That's right.

423
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,320
Well I'm a dirty, low-down, no-good...

424
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:54,535
You win that argument.
Go ahead, start another one.

425
00:30:54,634 --> 00:30:56,873
You're cutting in on me.
I go with Helen.

426
00:30:56,908 --> 00:31:00,046
- You went with Helen.
- Now I see why I'm on shipment.

427
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:01,138
You're pulling your rank on me.

428
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:05,324
Don't do it Sarge. 96 article of war.
Sock him and the Captain will bust you.

429
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,279
Put this on the bulletin board.

430
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:16,685
Sgt. Puccinilli, Millie will be here at 6:45 pm.
Must see you or there might be trouble.

431
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:21,267
You can take off wise guy and start
packing. I've got work to do.

432
00:31:22,387 --> 00:31:24,802
- This ain't no poolroom.
- No?

433
00:31:24,837 --> 00:31:28,489
- I could have sworn I just saw an eight-ball.
- Get out of here.

434
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:04,771
- And what do you think you're doing?
- I'm singing.

435
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:05,989
You call this singing?

436
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:09,202
- Didn't you like it a little?
- I didn't even like it a lot.

437
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:11,980
You have to admit,
my voice is different.

438
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,606
Come on Sarge, let's hear you sing it.

439
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:16,791
I can't. I've got some work to do
and besides, I've got a date in town.

440
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,735
Come on Sergeant!

441
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:21,047
Okay. One chord.

442
00:34:24,954 --> 00:34:28,234
All right boys. Come on.
Let's get going. Come on.

443
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,461
- How long before Miller gets here?
- About 20 minutes.

444
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,569
I'd like to find the joker that spread
the rumor around that I'm already a
warrant-officer.

445
00:34:41,604 --> 00:34:42,082
Why?

446
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:46,020
Every time I walk into the barracks
some nitwit say out: Attention!

447
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,207
I walked in while McVey was shaving,

448
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,178
he snapped to attention
and nearly cut his throat.

449
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,908
Sgt McVey cut his throat?

450
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,954
Nah, he just nicked a little
but he bled like a stuck pig.

451
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:58,102
Okay you lucky people.
You can go to town now.

452
00:34:58,103 --> 00:34:59,617
I'm ready to take over.

453
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,177
Take that junk into the Captain's office.

454
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:03,022
And take that with you!

455
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,035
Hey Corwin, give me
a hand with this, will you?

456
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:11,616
Well I guess that wraps things up, Clark.
Go on, get home to the little woman.

457
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:13,937
Thanks Sarge!
See you in the morning.

458
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:16,365
I'll be back in a minute.

459
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:19,492
Hey Corwin. Don't forget you
have to polish up outside too.

460
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:24,276
Listen Shaughnessy. Some dame
might drop in here asking for me,

461
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:25,993
so tell her I'm out running
the obstacle course.

462
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:27,216
Okay, Sarge.

463
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:34,858
You know Shaughnessy, I kind of
wish McVey would cut this throat.

464
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:36,801
How could he blow his whistle?

465
00:35:38,742 --> 00:35:42,266
You know, some people tell you when
you get in the army, you get used to it.

466
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:45,384
But they don't say how long it takes,
and I ain't getting any younger.

467
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:48,000
- You know something Corwin?
- Hey Corporal!

468
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:52,217
Come on.
Let's be giving me the pass.

469
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:53,930
So what are your plans
for the night, Sarge?

470
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:56,052
Oh, I guess I'll get me
a couple of beers...

471
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:58,230
- So, going to wet your whistle eh?
- You bet.

472
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:02,691
Come on, let's be hurrying.

473
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:10,558
Hey, there's something you missed.

474
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:13,967
Let's be getting on the ball.

475
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:17,511
Yeah, but nobody can see up there
Sergeant.

476
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,955
That don't make no difference!

477
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:23,327
It's awful sloppy around here.

478
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,308
You gotta be neat.

479
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:28,850
You gotta be tidy.

480
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,051
Cause if we ain't,
somebody's gonna get it.

481
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,730
This army ain't just a place
to have fun you know.

482
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,547
Well, if anybody asks for me,
I'm painting the town.

483
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:46,736
And when I'm painting the town...

484
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,521
...I'm painting the town.

485
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,316
Big man.

486
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,869
Gotta be neat.

487
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,487
Gotta be tidy.

488
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:10,603
Here's something you missed.

489
00:37:12,294 --> 00:37:14,767
Let's be getting on the ball.

490
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,445
Yeah, but Sergeant,
nobody can see that.

491
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,274
That don't make no difference!

492
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:27,361
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be out painting the town.

493
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,184
And when I paint the town...

494
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,448
...I'm painting the town.

495
00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:37,678
Take it easy son.

496
00:37:37,775 --> 00:37:39,720
Why does that McVey
have to be in the army for?

497
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:41,374
Why couldn't he be in the navy?

498
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:43,696
I can't sleep in the afternoon
on account of that guy.

499
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:44,969
Why don't you take a poke at him?

500
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:47,267
Me take a poke at Sergeant McVey?

501
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,447
You know what they'd do to me?

502
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:51,070
What can they do to you? There's
nothing lower than what you are now.

503
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,479
Look, in the regulations, it says that
you can challenge anybody in the army.

504
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:57,540
If you think they're taking advantage of
you, ask them to put the gloves on with you.

505
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:01,200
You mean I could sock Sergeant McVey
in the nose and nobody would say nothing?

506
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,321
Sure.

507
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:05,646
- What if he hit me first?
- But you don't let him.

508
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,294
You see it's a matter of science lad.
Come here, I'll show you.

509
00:38:10,977 --> 00:38:12,185
Strike a pose.

510
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:16,025
Now you see first
you gotta take a style.

511
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:18,222
John L. Sullivan.

512
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,456
No, that's not for you.

513
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:24,581
Wait a minute.
The Jack Dempsey crouch.

514
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:27,720
That's better. You're a killer!

515
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:31,046
Get low! Lower. Lower!

516
00:38:36,588 --> 00:38:38,195
Hey I got it. Come here.

517
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:41,522
Toni Cassaneri. That's it.

518
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:44,389
He was a ballet dancer.

519
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:05,614
Oh no. Look, you gotta have
rhythm. Watch.

520
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:31,034
Corwin. Come here.

521
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,215
- What are you doing?
- I'm training.

522
00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:35,039
For what?

523
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,139
I'm going to put the gloves
on with Sergeant McVey.

524
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,091
McVey?

525
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:39,414
Yeah, I'm going to jab his head off.

526
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,921
Where do you want the body sent?

527
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:43,794
- Send it to McVey's parents.
- Your body!

528
00:39:44,102 --> 00:39:46,113
Go on, get in and finish
the rest of your work.

529
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:53,692
- Vic.
- No!

530
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,676
Can't I just talk to you for a minute?

531
00:39:56,886 --> 00:39:58,535
All right.
What do you want now?

532
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,068
- Remember that song we wrote together?
- Yeah, what about it?

533
00:40:01,078 --> 00:40:02,988
Well, we got a telegram from the
music publisher and he...

534
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:05,671
...wants us to put the song on a
record and send it to him right away.

535
00:40:05,743 --> 00:40:07,022
Go ahead and make a record of it.

536
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,879
No, I want you should record it.

537
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:10,186
Get Bing Crosby.

538
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:12,449
I like you better.

539
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:15,402
Oh you don't have to fight McVey.
You're punchy already.

540
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,579
Why? Just cause I like you better?

541
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:20,719
At least you could do, is show a
little consideration for me.

542
00:40:21,272 --> 00:40:24,293
Sure, I know you're a sergeant and
I'm only a private.

543
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,191
At least you could do,
is be a little friendly.

544
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,695
All right. I love you, I'm your friend.
What do you want me to do?

545
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:31,186
If you never ever give me
a pass again, I don't care.

546
00:40:31,187 --> 00:40:32,904
Just take this song into town tonight.

547
00:40:32,993 --> 00:40:34,806
You know that place where you put
a quarter in the machine...

548
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:37,649
...instead of writing home to your
mother, you send your voice on a record.

549
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:45,652
- Here's a quarter.
- But I got a date.

550
00:40:45,995 --> 00:40:48,393
So what? Take your date to the
recording booth with you.

551
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:51,575
Might be a little warm,
might be a little fun.

552
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:53,654
All right. I'll record it.

553
00:40:54,473 --> 00:40:55,497
Millie!

554
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,753
I'll be seeing you.

555
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:02,338
Come in.

556
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,597
Oh hello.

557
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:09,330
Hello.
Is Sergeant Puccinelli in?

558
00:41:09,365 --> 00:41:13,927
- Oh no, he out on a bizzwhack.
- Oh that's a shame. How'd it happen?

559
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,551
Say, haven't I seen
you someplace before?

560
00:41:17,896 --> 00:41:23,138
You might have seen me at the PX.
Number 10. I used to sell beer.

561
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:26,428
But I asked to be transferred
to the candy counter.

562
00:41:26,453 --> 00:41:28,132
What happened?
Did you get hungry?

563
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,375
- Good evening Corporal.
- Oh hi.

564
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,470
Aren't you going to introduce us?

565
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:35,375
Private Edwards meet a friend.
Friend, meet Private Edwards.

566
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:36,876
Your name's Millie, isn't it?

567
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,507
Millie doesn't look it, but she just
switched from beer to candy.

568
00:41:39,937 --> 00:41:42,239
Would you like to take
your break now Corporal?

569
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:43,687
Definitely.

570
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,705
Glad to have met you.

571
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:48,290
Oh thank you. If you want
anything, just ring for the bellboy.

572
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:50,907
He's nice, isn't he?

573
00:41:52,028 --> 00:41:57,399
- Do you think Cutie will be here tonight?
- Cutie? You mean Puccinelli?

574
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,535
No, I don't think he can make it.

575
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,280
But anything you want to tell
him, why you can tell me.

576
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,313
What's your name?

577
00:42:07,314 --> 00:42:10,536
The charge of quarters was
so crazy when he introduced us...

578
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:14,289
...all that I remember is that
you're a friend of his.

579
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:19,406
U.S. That's cute.
Monogrammed blankets.

580
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:25,953
My name is Caldwell.
Private Ernie Caldwell.

581
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:29,245
I was just thinking that if you're not
doing anything tomorrow night...

582
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:30,620
Oh tomorrow night.

583
00:42:32,192 --> 00:42:33,101
Hello.

584
00:42:34,127 --> 00:42:36,442
Don't you know enough to knock
before you come into a room?

585
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,189
Gee whizz. I was just down at the PX

586
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,427
and I thought that Corporal
Shaughnessy would like some ice-cream.

587
00:42:40,448 --> 00:42:42,601
Set it on the desk.
I'll see that he gets it.

588
00:42:48,888 --> 00:42:50,698
The spoon's inside.

589
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:03,391
We'll keep this between the two of us.

590
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,302
You don't got to worry about me.
I'm no snitcher.

591
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,162
Got a cigarette?

592
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:41,027
Corporal I've got to get into town
right away. Can I have a pass?

593
00:43:41,045 --> 00:43:42,348
Are you nuts?
You're restricted.

594
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:44,501
But the fellas forgot the music.
I've got to have a pass.

595
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:45,489
Nothing doing.

596
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:47,040
Corporal it's a matter
of life and death.

597
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:48,090
Nothing doing.

598
00:45:34,074 --> 00:45:36,894
Can you sing Melancholy Baby?

599
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:39,795
- No!
- That's okay, I'm glad.

600
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,797
I hate that Melancholy Baby.

601
00:46:04,913 --> 00:46:06,455
I beg your pardon, did you see...

602
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:10,987
I beg your pardon.
Oh never mind.

603
00:46:13,697 --> 00:46:18,006
Hey Charlie.
What was that?

604
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:20,296
I don't know Sarge.

605
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:22,122
Excuse me.

606
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:25,652
I beg your pardon.

607
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,888
Did you see what I saw?

608
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:29,903
Yeah.

609
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:48,485
Here's a light.

610
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:50,926
What'll you have?

611
00:46:51,656 --> 00:46:53,170
Creme de cassis.

612
00:46:54,534 --> 00:46:56,753
Creme de cassis.

613
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:28,885
Excuse me little lady.
How about a little drink?

614
00:47:28,986 --> 00:47:30,150
Please!

615
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:35,374
- Hey, can you sing Melancholy Baby?
- Bartender!

616
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,063
All right Romeo.

617
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:41,533
I'm just buying a little drink
for Melancholy Baby.

618
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,787
You've had enough Sarge.

619
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:49,429
I ain't going to stop drinking,
until she starts looking good to me.

620
00:47:58,059 --> 00:48:00,931
You're the first dame I ever met...

621
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:05,698
...who didn't remind of any
other dame I ever met.

622
00:48:06,937 --> 00:48:08,530
Bartender, How much
do I owe you?

623
00:48:08,536 --> 00:48:09,695
A half a buck.

624
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,461
- Thank you.
- Thank you! You've been very nice.

625
00:48:18,606 --> 00:48:22,673
- What were you saying?
- How about singing a little song?

626
00:48:23,077 --> 00:48:26,210
A little song for soldier?
Would you like ah...

627
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:29,544
creeve dian song? Or a...

628
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:33,614
goblin song?
Or possibly you'd like a...

629
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:36,559
lap low bin zin zin song?
Hmm?

630
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:40,106
Oh I'm awfully sorry.

631
00:48:44,648 --> 00:48:46,398
- Will you play this please?
- Oh sure.

632
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:47,999
Thank you.

633
00:50:53,128 --> 00:50:54,331
It's me Alvin.

634
00:50:54,332 --> 00:50:57,400
Alvin? What on earth are you
doing in that outfit? Are you nuts?

635
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,885
- Me nuts?
- You guys ran off and forgot the music.

636
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:00,808
What if you get caught?

637
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:02,766
Never mind. Get Puch in
that recording booth.

638
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:04,586
We got to have those records
the first thing in the morning.

639
00:51:04,621 --> 00:51:05,723
He's over there.

640
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:11,733
- Now as I was saying.
- Yes Vic?

641
00:51:12,323 --> 00:51:16,560
Helen, you look so wonderful tonight.
Could I interest you in a slightly used kiss?

642
00:51:16,961 --> 00:51:18,066
Hey Sarge.

643
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:20,024
Now what do you guys want?

644
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:22,043
We have to go back to camp.
We forgot the music.

645
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,446
Well don't bother me.
Give it to Sam at the piano.

646
00:51:24,783 --> 00:51:25,993
Okay Sarge.

647
00:51:30,426 --> 00:51:33,516
- What's the matter Vic?
- Oh nothing. Just one of those things.

648
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,046
Come on. What is it?

649
00:51:36,244 --> 00:51:38,451
- I didn't want to tell you but...
- But what?

650
00:51:38,886 --> 00:51:40,826
- We're being alerted.
- Alerted?

651
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:43,209
But Vic.

652
00:51:44,387 --> 00:51:46,421
Well what am I going
to do when you're gone?

653
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:48,839
Why Helen, are you going
to miss me that much?

654
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:50,827
Well, sure Vic.

655
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:55,036
This might sound a little hokey,
but I wrote a song and...

656
00:51:55,303 --> 00:51:57,619
I'd like to make a record
of it, just for you.

657
00:51:58,331 --> 00:52:00,692
Oh Vic. That's nice.

658
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,524
Would you mind stepping into
the booth while I record it?

659
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,162
I'd love to.

660
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:49,149
All right Corwin. What are you doing?
Are you going to make this your life's work?

661
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:50,214
What do you want from me?

662
00:54:50,215 --> 00:54:52,764
Why don't you worry about what you are
doing and I'll worry about what I'm doing...

663
00:54:52,781 --> 00:54:54,447
I never made this
stuff before in my life.

664
00:54:54,448 --> 00:54:56,437
When those guys are ready,
boy I'll give it all.

665
00:54:57,605 --> 00:54:59,701
Worry about what your doing,
let me worry about what I'm doing,

666
00:54:59,702 --> 00:55:01,516
I've never done anything
like this before in my whole life.

667
00:55:01,577 --> 00:55:02,962
Who are you?

668
00:55:13,365 --> 00:55:15,615
Good boy Corwin, good boy.

669
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:17,986
Now come on. Let's go down
to the little old dispensary.

670
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,030
What? The where?

671
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,305
The little old dispensary.

672
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:23,643
We're going to take the little old arm, and
we're going to roll up the little old sleeve...

673
00:55:23,706 --> 00:55:27,110
then we'll get the little old needle
and give you a little old shot...

674
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:29,490
and it aint' going to hurt
a little old bit. Come on.

675
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:32,876
- You sure it ain't going to hurt?
- No it won't hurt you a bit. Come on.

676
00:55:33,168 --> 00:55:34,780
Good boy, go ahead.

677
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:41,358
Believe me, when I tell you, son. You
won't even feel the little old needle.

678
00:55:41,393 --> 00:55:42,919
I won't feel the little old needle?

679
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:46,346
- No, won't even hurt you a little bit?
- Won't even hurt me a little bit?

680
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,293
No.

681
00:55:47,438 --> 00:55:50,164
- Is it a square needle?
- Round needle.

682
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,177
Next.

683
00:56:12,259 --> 00:56:13,347
Corwin!

684
00:56:15,874 --> 00:56:17,286
Now just relax.

685
00:56:20,414 --> 00:56:21,626
Roll up your sleeve.

686
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:23,879
Think of something pleasant.

687
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:26,525
You're eating ice-cream.

688
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,303
You're dancing with a beautiful,
beautiful girl.

689
00:56:29,784 --> 00:56:32,279
You're sleeping in a white dreamy bed.

690
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:40,201
I didn't get to the last part.

691
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:44,733
Now that didn't hurt a bit, did it?
How do you feel?

692
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:48,507
Feel good? Okay.
Come on, let's go.

693
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,624
Corwin!

694
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:55,952
Come in.

695
00:57:06,879 --> 00:57:09,793
- Does this finish up your malaria shots?
- Yes Corporal.

696
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:13,282
- And me too.
- Here take this note into the mess sergeant.

697
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,536
How do you feel?

698
00:57:15,537 --> 00:57:16,610
How do you think I feel?

699
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:18,856
What do you think I am in there?
A pin cushion.

700
00:57:19,863 --> 00:57:21,984
- You said it wouldn't hurt me.
- You'll live.

701
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,883
That's what I'm afraid of.

702
00:57:26,178 --> 00:57:27,392
- Good-morning Corporal.
- Good-morning Captain.

703
00:57:28,837 --> 00:57:30,049
As you were.

704
00:57:33,023 --> 00:57:37,499
Puccinelli, I talked to Colonel
Davies and he is going to put you
on that overseas movement.

705
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:38,482
That's swell Captain.

706
00:57:38,772 --> 00:57:41,951
Corporal Clark tell you about the army
woman that was in army room yesterday?

707
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:43,463
Yes sir.

708
00:57:43,475 --> 00:57:46,500
She's having trouble locating some
man in the company.

709
00:57:46,882 --> 00:57:48,496
And I want you to find the man.

710
00:57:48,825 --> 00:57:51,449
Yes sir. I'll try, but it won't be easy.

711
00:57:51,484 --> 00:57:53,609
She could make things nasty, if she
got to the Colonel.

712
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,574
- Will you take care of it?
- I'll do my best sir.

713
00:57:56,667 --> 00:58:00,038
Good! As soon as you find the
man, I want to see him.

714
00:58:00,111 --> 00:58:01,120
Yes sir.

715
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:06,654
How do you like that? Now I'm in
charge of domestic relations.

716
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:10,238
Even that little old alert gag I pulled
on Millie just to kiss her a few times...

717
00:58:10,339 --> 00:58:11,684
You know that could develop a taste.

718
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:13,916
Douse them lights. The
Colonel is coming by.

719
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:30,004
Sgt Puccinelli, I'd like to see your
copy of the master training schedule.

720
00:58:30,898 --> 00:58:34,513
- It's supposed to be posted
on the bulletin board
- Yes sir.

721
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:37,371
Corporal Clark, show the Colonel
where we posted the schedule.

722
00:58:38,608 --> 00:58:39,458
What was that?

723
00:58:39,459 --> 00:58:41,199
Ah, he said it's right over here, sir.

724
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,484
- It's here sir.
- I can't see it.

725
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:48,776
It's, it's... I'm sure I put it here.

726
00:58:48,811 --> 00:58:51,035
Well it doesn't seem to be here now.

727
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:53,423
I think it's in the other room Colonel.

728
00:58:56,569 --> 00:58:58,821
- What was that?
- I think it's in the other room.

729
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:00,367
Colonel.

730
00:59:22,082 --> 00:59:24,103
- Good morning Colonel.
- Good morning Caldwell

731
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,976
We can't seem to find a copy of that
master training schedule.

732
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:29,631
It should be posted in
every orderly room.

733
00:59:29,684 --> 00:59:31,114
It's probably there sir.

734
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:35,809
- No it isn't on that board.
- I can't understand why it isn't up.

735
00:59:41,902 --> 00:59:42,913
Here it is.

736
00:59:48,245 --> 00:59:50,793
I hope it looks better than your
orderly room.

737
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:53,969
Sergeant Puccinelli.

738
01:00:00,258 --> 01:00:01,655
Open that door!

739
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:33,335
I hope someday to see a copy of
that master training schedule.

740
01:00:33,465 --> 01:00:35,954
We found it sir.
It was posted under SOP.

741
01:00:37,382 --> 01:00:41,639
Ah yes. Well no wonder I didn't
see it. It's too dark in here.

742
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:44,047
Turn on those lights.

743
01:00:53,304 --> 01:00:54,317
Here's the envelope from battalion.

744
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:59,024
- So you're really going to ship me out?
- That's right.

745
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:03,228
Well "Cutie". I had a nice little
talk last night with Millie and...

746
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:04,006
And?

747
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:06,754
And I'll give you the rest of the day
to get my name off that list.

748
01:01:06,785 --> 01:01:09,381
Don't threaten me.
Get out!

749
01:01:11,355 --> 01:01:12,636
Wait a minute.

750
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:13,953
It's a pleasure.

751
01:01:13,988 --> 01:01:16,526
Here's a telegram for Corwin.
Give it to him in the mess hall.

752
01:01:18,198 --> 01:01:19,439
Sergeant Puccinelli.

753
01:01:19,615 --> 01:01:22,002
Colonel Davies is going to inspect
the supply room.

754
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:24,530
- And following that, the mess hall.
- Yes sir.

755
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:28,142
- Hey Miller!
- Yeah?

756
01:01:28,622 --> 01:01:31,510
- The Colonel is going to
inspect in a minute.
- Oh no Sarge!

757
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,944
Ditch this for me.

758
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:37,464
- Where am I going to hide this?
- A long one for Louie.

759
01:01:37,957 --> 01:01:41,193
It's all right.
We're part of the charges.

760
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:44,854
Captain, what's gotten
into this company?

761
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:48,286
- Well a few things have gone wrong sir.
- A few things?

762
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,941
Captain I have never...

763
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:55,928
- What was that?
- Sounds like the mess hall.

764
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,128
Mess hall?

765
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:01,538
- Signal's over.
- What's the meaning of this?

766
01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:07,113
Sergeant Puccinelli,
what's going on here?

767
01:02:08,211 --> 01:02:11,144
What's that whistle?
Is it a fire? What is it?

768
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:15,233
It's a baby. Vic look!
It's a little baby!

769
01:02:15,268 --> 01:02:16,378
Look! We got it.

770
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:18,740
Look when we first married,
we didn't think we'd have any,

771
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:20,829
and now we got a little... COLONEL!

772
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:27,631
Colonel said this is the most
outrageous company he's ever seen.

773
01:02:28,013 --> 01:02:29,761
And he's cancelled you off
that shipping order.

774
01:02:29,882 --> 01:02:32,441
- You mean I can't go overseas?
- That's right.

775
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:34,313
Here it is in writing.

776
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:41,455
I'm sorry sir.
Yes sir.

777
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:45,532
How do you like that?

778
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:47,879
Five years in this man's army.

779
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,114
Five years and the day
before I go on shipment...

780
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,827
I get caught in this filthy machinery.

781
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:56,147
- What's the first class this afternoon?
- Calisthenics.

782
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:59,768
Oh fine, that's all I need. There's got
to be an easier way to make a living.

783
01:03:07,615 --> 01:03:10,980
I'm afraid this little number will
keep us busy for a week.

784
01:03:11,292 --> 01:03:13,827
- Oh good afternoon Mrs. Caldwell.
- Good afternoon.

785
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:15,287
How soon will you be ready?

786
01:03:15,361 --> 01:03:18,748
Well, well, well. All dressed up
to go places, I see.

787
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:22,753
I'm afraid for once in my life,
I have a surprise for you.

788
01:03:23,069 --> 01:03:24,080
Really?

789
01:03:24,146 --> 01:03:26,362
It seems that without consulting you...

790
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:29,307
the Colonel has given B-company
officers a special problem

791
01:03:29,308 --> 01:03:31,958
which will undoubtedly
take all night to do.

792
01:03:32,137 --> 01:03:33,722
What kind of problem?

793
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:37,986
We have to identify a number of
South Pacific islands by their topography.

794
01:03:39,379 --> 01:03:41,810
Sally said you wouldn't get
that till tomorrow.

795
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:45,319
Then you must have done
something to anger Sally, because
she gave it to us today.

796
01:03:45,946 --> 01:03:47,882
Well I'll tell her a thing or two...

797
01:03:48,054 --> 01:03:50,150
I might have come out
without the answers.

798
01:03:51,823 --> 01:03:53,610
The answers?

799
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:57,081
Yes, I have them right here,
some place.

800
01:03:59,062 --> 01:04:00,370
Here you are.

801
01:04:02,369 --> 01:04:05,996
Munich, Strasburg,
these aren't the answers.

802
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,110
Oh, that's C-company.

803
01:04:09,716 --> 01:04:11,029
Here's yours.

804
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:15,509
Ero, Colsoe, Tagora... I...

805
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:19,995
If I thought there was another
woman like Dorothy on this earth...

806
01:04:20,095 --> 01:04:21,809
I'd tell you to get married at once.

807
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,584
Honey, this is wonderful.

808
01:04:23,617 --> 01:04:25,873
I'm certainly glad you appreciate me.

809
01:04:26,204 --> 01:04:29,020
Well, I've got a few things
to pick up at the PX.

810
01:04:29,021 --> 01:04:32,263
And I'll be back to pick
you up in exactly 20 minutes.

811
01:04:36,307 --> 01:04:38,754
I'd better give this to Captain
Starner in C-company.

812
01:04:40,702 --> 01:04:42,257
At ease men.

813
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:51,375
That McVey. Can you imagine that?
He wants another good-conduct ribbon.

814
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:52,575
How does he lose so many?

815
01:04:52,615 --> 01:04:56,341
I don't know. He gets plastered and
deal them out like fraternity pins.

816
01:04:56,584 --> 01:04:59,179
Hey, the Colonel is checking
calisthenics.

817
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,176
- I beg your pardon sir.
- Yes, what is it?

818
01:05:08,211 --> 01:05:10,418
The Colonel is checking orderly rooms...

819
01:05:24,598 --> 01:05:27,226
- Sergeant Miller on duty sir.
- Where is Sergeant Puccinelli?

820
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:30,512
With the company, taking calisthenics
sir. Shall I get him for you sir?

821
01:05:30,547 --> 01:05:31,724
No.

822
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,410
No, the exercise will be good for him.

823
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:35,124
Yes sir.

824
01:05:35,334 --> 01:05:36,578
- Miller...
- Yes sir?

825
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:41,084
At ease. What's the name of that
Sergeant, the one with the whistle?

826
01:05:41,264 --> 01:05:42,831
Oh you mean McVey sir.

827
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:45,935
I want you to find McVey immediately.

828
01:05:45,936 --> 01:05:50,315
Tell him to get this entire outfit on the
obstacle course in 10 minutes. Understand?

829
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,263
Yes sir!

830
01:06:29,488 --> 01:06:30,690
Hey Corwin.

831
01:06:43,257 --> 01:06:45,690
Come on let's go.
Head's down.

832
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:49,040
Alright you guys, keep it moving.
Now let's go.

833
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:52,451
I want to hear them helmets.
Keep the file on. Keep moving.

834
01:07:09,031 --> 01:07:12,416
All right, come on. Come out fresh,
keep them moving.

835
01:07:17,211 --> 01:07:21,194
Hey Corwin, come out. You're beginning
to fall back. Let's get out of there.

836
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:28,422
All right come on, keep crawling.

837
01:07:29,172 --> 01:07:31,633
All right let's go. Come on.
Stay with it.

838
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:35,521
Come on. Wing it away.
Keep it moving.

839
01:07:35,522 --> 01:07:39,694
Cross back there like a man. Come on
let's go. You're holding it up there!

840
01:07:41,084 --> 01:07:45,424
Come on Corwin, let's go. You're holding
up the detail. All the guys are waiting.

841
01:07:45,459 --> 01:07:47,773
On this side Corwin, are you crazy?

842
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,411
On this side! Stay here now!

843
01:07:51,162 --> 01:07:52,653
Come on, you can do it.

844
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,593
Corwin! That ain't regulation.

845
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:06,836
Taken like a bird.

846
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:12,601
Corwin!

847
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,716
- Yes Sarge?
- You've got to stop this clowning.

848
01:08:25,678 --> 01:08:27,781
All right you guys, keep it down low.

849
01:08:39,695 --> 01:08:40,997
Hey! Corwin!

850
01:08:41,626 --> 01:08:43,235
What happened to Corwin?

851
01:08:47,148 --> 01:08:48,454
Hey Corwin!

852
01:08:50,605 --> 01:08:52,521
Hey hey Corwin!

853
01:08:54,619 --> 01:08:55,926
This way.

854
01:09:02,078 --> 01:09:05,480
Alright, let's go. Come on. You're
holding it up. Look alive there.

855
01:09:09,155 --> 01:09:11,658
All right you guys.
Come on now, come on now.

856
01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:26,955
Keep it rolling. What are you doing
up there? Mailing letters?

857
01:09:31,779 --> 01:09:33,281
Oh Corwin...

858
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:37,823
Corwin?
Hey Corwin you all right?

859
01:09:38,295 --> 01:09:40,409
Water! Get some water!
Hurry up!

860
01:09:41,032 --> 01:09:42,832
Here you are Sarge.
What do I do with it?

861
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:44,257
Let him have it.

862
01:09:53,466 --> 01:09:55,293
Wait a second.
Now take it easy.

863
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:57,786
Come on. You all right Corwin?

864
01:11:53,274 --> 01:11:56,625
Well I'm glad to see that they finally
fixed that soft drink machine.

865
01:11:57,028 --> 01:12:00,745
Well, I think I'll go in there and take
care of that supply sergeant now.

866
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:06,506
You know, he turns the same articles
in for salvage over and over again.

867
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:09,864
You'd think he was going to
open up an army and navy store.

868
01:12:13,693 --> 01:12:14,857
As you were.

869
01:12:16,154 --> 01:12:18,043
- Sergeant Miller?
- Yes Sergeant?

870
01:12:20,396 --> 01:12:23,276
- Hey where's Sergeant Puccinelli?
- I don't know.

871
01:12:23,612 --> 01:12:25,271
Boy he's sure in trouble again.

872
01:12:25,427 --> 01:12:28,871
The Colonel's after him, the Captain's
after him and Millie's after him.

873
01:12:28,936 --> 01:12:31,923
I wouldn't trade places with him
with 14 points.

874
01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:47,724
I see that you took care of that
supply situation to your satisfaction.

875
01:12:47,759 --> 01:12:48,566
Yes sir!

876
01:12:49,401 --> 01:12:52,243
I don't think we'll have anymore
trouble with Sergeant Miller.

877
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:55,169
I have to get on to my next plan.

878
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:12,601
Boy that was close! The Colonel
almost had me that time.

879
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:17,604
- Got a cigarette.
- Yeah, sure Sarge. Here, roll your own.

880
01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:19,055
That'll be all Sergeant Miller.

881
01:13:23,837 --> 01:13:25,632
What's Miller featuring today?

882
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:40,548
- 40 medium?
- Natch.

883
01:13:51,996 --> 01:13:52,847
Yes sir?

884
01:13:53,182 --> 01:13:55,914
Have you made any progress
finding out about that girl?

885
01:13:57,324 --> 01:13:58,189
What girl?

886
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:00,286
The one who was in
the orderly room yesterday.

887
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:03,124
Oh yes sir. I have a hunch sir.

888
01:14:03,677 --> 01:14:05,428
I want to see that man
as soon as possible.

889
01:14:05,619 --> 01:14:06,743
Yes sir.

890
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,693
- Hey where's Corwin?
- He's in the rec hall rehearsing.

891
01:14:16,777 --> 01:14:19,355
Rehearsing for what?
How to become a mental case?

892
01:15:42,923 --> 01:15:44,523
- Okay, come on, let's go.
- Where?

893
01:15:44,744 --> 01:15:47,664
- To see Captain Caldwell.
- What'd I do now?

894
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:50,346
You'll find out and I'm delivering
you C.O.D. Come on.

895
01:15:50,347 --> 01:15:51,420
What about the number?

896
01:15:51,429 --> 01:15:53,809
- What number?
- You promised Pokey you'd do it.

897
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,954
Well tell him to get with it, but hurry up.

898
01:15:57,273 --> 01:15:58,504
All right, go ahead, ask him.

899
01:15:58,513 --> 01:16:01,724
But watch how you ask him. In a
nice way. Use a little diplomacy.

900
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:05,044
You say: Pokey, will you play a song
for Vic and I, we're going to dance.

901
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:06,115
Cause you and me Alvin.

902
01:16:06,116 --> 01:16:09,948
We're going to be together a long, long
time. You and me, we're friends right?

903
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:10,918
So ask Pokey.

904
01:16:10,919 --> 01:16:14,508
Go ahead ask him and I'll wait too.
Cause I have nothing else to say. Go ahead.

905
01:16:14,621 --> 01:16:18,473
You say: Pokey, play some music for Vic
and I. Go ahead. What are you waiting for?

906
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:19,714
- Don't make...
- Alright!

907
01:16:20,872 --> 01:16:22,749
I forgot what I was
going to ask him now.

908
01:16:23,898 --> 01:16:27,700
Oh yeah! Pokey, will you play this dance
song so that Vic and I can do this together?

909
01:16:28,265 --> 01:16:30,177
- Sure.
- Thanks a heap.

910
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,198
- Old song and dance?
- Old song and dance?

911
01:17:34,503 --> 01:17:36,740
No, the whole band, they should
play it together.

912
01:17:41,971 --> 01:17:43,111
What are you waiting for?

913
01:17:43,304 --> 01:17:46,059
Look buster, I don't do it unless
the Sergeant tells me.

914
01:17:48,082 --> 01:17:49,092
Okay folks.

915
01:18:12,657 --> 01:18:14,591
All right folks, let's quiet down now.

916
01:18:14,952 --> 01:18:19,678
We'd like to present First Sergeant
Victor Puccinelli and Private First
Class, Alvin Corwin.

917
01:18:19,765 --> 01:18:22,344
Doing their impression of
two great personalities.

918
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:39,018
Well, top of the morning to you fellow.

919
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,620
How are you me boy?

920
01:18:44,705 --> 01:18:48,791
I just thought I'd stop over now son,
and let you know that...

921
01:18:49,896 --> 01:18:52,974
I don't knock the idea of you leaving
in St. Dominique's charge.

922
01:18:53,009 --> 01:18:55,747
Well I kind of hate to see you
leave the place too padre.

923
01:18:57,169 --> 01:19:00,829
I was just wondering if I might ask
a wee bit of a favor now son.

924
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:02,014
Well, go right ahead.

925
01:19:03,732 --> 01:19:06,498
I would love you to sing one
of me old Irish lullabies.

926
01:19:06,499 --> 01:19:08,337
Just once now, before you go.

927
01:19:08,956 --> 01:19:11,488
Now which little Irish lullaby
you thinking about?

928
01:19:12,786 --> 01:19:15,095
The one you did that night
I was so sick in bed son.

929
01:19:15,096 --> 01:19:16,988
You remember that
one, now don't you lad?

930
01:19:17,288 --> 01:19:21,394
Well, couldn't rightly do it for you
tonight Padre, for I got to have
music behind me, you know that.

931
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:27,065
But I've got a music box with me.
Won't you try now son?

932
01:19:27,257 --> 01:19:31,620
- It should be a pleasure to do it for you.
- Just open it wide open.

933
01:20:47,054 --> 01:20:49,101
Sir, would you still like to see
the man I spoke to you about?

934
01:20:49,102 --> 01:20:50,467
The one that caused all the trouble.

935
01:20:50,482 --> 01:20:52,116
- Definitely!
- Yes sir.

936
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:53,477
Corwin...

937
01:20:54,028 --> 01:20:55,326
Come here.

938
01:21:05,139 --> 01:21:08,097
Private First Class Corwin
reporting sir, as ordered.

939
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:08,977
At ease.

940
01:21:09,981 --> 01:21:11,078
Corwin...

941
01:21:11,382 --> 01:21:12,434
What's your first name?

942
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:14,112
- Alvin.
- Alvin?

943
01:21:14,142 --> 01:21:14,942
Yes sir.

944
01:21:15,055 --> 01:21:20,159
Alvin, bringing children into the
world is a solemn matter.

945
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:23,937
Solemn sir? I didn't
think it was so solemn.

946
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,002
That's the trouble.

947
01:21:25,692 --> 01:21:28,343
Sometimes we don't realize
it until it's too late.

948
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:31,683
Now, what do you intend
to do about this matter?

949
01:21:31,907 --> 01:21:33,716
Nothing sir. Everything's
been done already.

950
01:21:33,751 --> 01:21:35,491
That's the wrong attitude entirely.

951
01:21:36,327 --> 01:21:39,364
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No sir. I'm very proud.

952
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:40,807
Proud?

953
01:21:40,828 --> 01:21:43,648
Yes sir. We wanted a baby,
so we got a baby.

954
01:21:43,672 --> 01:21:45,758
- You wanted a baby?
- Yes sir.

955
01:21:46,283 --> 01:21:50,535
But don't you understand? You can't
let this baby grow up without a name.

956
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:52,606
I know.
We'll think of a name for it.

957
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:53,929
That's not what I mean.

958
01:21:54,611 --> 01:21:57,716
Now Corwin, listen to me closely.

959
01:21:58,262 --> 01:22:00,484
Do you have any
love for this woman?

960
01:22:00,933 --> 01:22:04,850
- Yes sir. I love her very much.
- Then my job should be simple.

961
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:07,315
I'm going to give you a three-day
pass,

962
01:22:07,316 --> 01:22:09,835
so that you can go to this
girl and do right by her.

963
01:22:09,957 --> 01:22:10,854
Oh thank you sir.

964
01:22:10,889 --> 01:22:14,441
But understand, this pass is
only to give this baby a name.

965
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,027
Three-day pass to think of a
name...

966
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:19,207
I know sir, we'll name it after you.

967
01:22:19,242 --> 01:22:20,560
That's not necessary.

968
01:22:21,192 --> 01:22:23,813
But I'll tell you this:
when the baby is born,

969
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:25,794
I'll see to it that you get
an emergency furlough.

970
01:22:26,081 --> 01:22:28,176
- Sir but I...
- No buts about it!

971
01:22:28,244 --> 01:22:33,137
- That'll be all. Get into class A uniform.
- Yes sir.

972
01:22:38,923 --> 01:22:41,987
Puccinelli. I've decided to give
Corwin a three-day pass.

973
01:22:42,022 --> 01:22:44,307
Pass? But Captain,
after what he did?

974
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:47,390
Well I have to give him a pass,
so he can get married.

975
01:22:48,018 --> 01:22:49,754
Get married? What for?

976
01:22:50,082 --> 01:22:54,138
Puccinelli. Is this or is this not
the man who is in trouble?

977
01:22:54,173 --> 01:22:56,780
Yes sir, yes sir!
He's in trouble all right, sir.

978
01:22:56,781 --> 01:22:59,322
What he means is, that the
baby's already been born.

979
01:22:59,951 --> 01:23:01,956
- Is that right Corwin?
- Ah, yes sir.

980
01:23:01,991 --> 01:23:03,795
Yes ma'am, yes sergeant.

981
01:23:03,998 --> 01:23:05,969
Well, that's different.
Give me that pass.

982
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:09,313
- Oh but Captain!
- We'll give you an emergency furlough.

983
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:12,014
Oh thank you.

984
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,531
But get this Corwin, you'd better
bring back a marriage certificate.

985
01:23:15,566 --> 01:23:17,425
Oh that's easy. I got
one in the barracks.

986
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:21,199
He doesn't mean his own sir. One of
the boys has one tacked up on the wall.

987
01:23:22,203 --> 01:23:23,947
Corwin, you'd better get ready to go.

988
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:25,999
Yes Sergeant.

989
01:23:34,024 --> 01:23:35,185
Well I'm off to battalion.

990
01:23:35,186 --> 01:23:36,917
Sir, you want me to type up
these furlough papers?

991
01:23:36,952 --> 01:23:39,408
No, I'll have it done at headquarters.
I want to push it right through.

992
01:23:43,742 --> 01:23:45,767
Clark, don't leave me here alone.

993
01:23:45,925 --> 01:23:49,373
- Cutie!
- Millie, what a surprise to see you here.

994
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:52,803
Well, I've been trying
so hard to see you.

995
01:23:52,838 --> 01:23:54,061
Millie, come here.

996
01:23:55,017 --> 01:23:57,114
Now tell me the truth.
Are you going to have...

997
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,279
Yes Vic.

998
01:23:58,610 --> 01:23:59,856
Where did you hear?

999
01:23:59,873 --> 01:24:02,497
Where did I hear? Well it's
practically a coast to coast hook-up.

1000
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:05,940
Look honey. Step into the
Captain's office, just for a minute.

1001
01:24:05,942 --> 01:24:08,535
No! There's too much traffic in there.

1002
01:24:08,766 --> 01:24:09,868
Please Millie.

1003
01:24:11,234 --> 01:24:12,206
Come in.

1004
01:24:14,505 --> 01:24:18,275
Victor Puccinelli. I have a few
questions to ask you.

1005
01:24:18,276 --> 01:24:19,158
Helen, listen.

1006
01:24:19,162 --> 01:24:22,135
And the first one has to do
with Jack Edwards.

1007
01:24:22,155 --> 01:24:23,553
Oh if that's all that's bothering you.

1008
01:24:23,744 --> 01:24:26,063
- Listen Cutie.
- Please Millie.

1009
01:24:27,405 --> 01:24:28,506
Who was that girl?

1010
01:24:29,078 --> 01:24:30,984
Mrs. Caldwell, the Captain's wife.

1011
01:24:31,688 --> 01:24:33,581
If you send Jack Edwards
out of this camp,

1012
01:24:33,582 --> 01:24:35,844
you can consider our
relationship at an end.

1013
01:24:35,962 --> 01:24:37,663
Oh you wouldn't do that,
would you honey?

1014
01:24:38,121 --> 01:24:39,348
On the contrary.

1015
01:24:39,349 --> 01:24:41,340
I'm not sure I'm in love
with either one of you, but...

1016
01:24:41,341 --> 01:24:43,353
Well, I want to be fair to you both.

1017
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:45,574
- Now look...
- Good afternoon Sergeant.

1018
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:48,693
Captain Caldwell, Miss Palmer, I'd
like to have you meet her.

1019
01:24:49,089 --> 01:24:50,639
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1020
01:24:52,275 --> 01:24:54,636
Captain, I think you are wanted
down at battalion headquarters.

1021
01:24:58,103 --> 01:24:59,400
Can I help you?

1022
01:25:00,603 --> 01:25:01,439
Lt. Davenport!

1023
01:25:02,429 --> 01:25:05,211
Now wait a minute.
Don't mix me up in this.

1024
01:25:06,422 --> 01:25:08,621
- Maybe I'd better leave.
- No! One moment.

1025
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:11,115
You've made a startling recovery,
haven't you?

1026
01:25:12,516 --> 01:25:14,708
I don't know what you're talking about.

1027
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,847
- Sergeant Puccinelli.
- Yes sir.

1028
01:25:17,452 --> 01:25:19,445
Now there he is.
Corwin, come in here.

1029
01:25:19,606 --> 01:25:20,728
Sit down young lady.

1030
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:22,367
Can you explain...

1031
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:24,226
First Class Corwin reporting
as ordered sir.

1032
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:28,573
Can you kindly explain why this
young lady is sitting here
completely recovered...

1033
01:25:29,645 --> 01:25:30,447
...and you're about

1034
01:25:32,124 --> 01:25:33,922
and you're about to start an
emergency furlough?

1035
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:35,781
Recovered sir? What was wrong
with her?

1036
01:25:36,223 --> 01:25:37,621
Don't try to be funny.

1037
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:40,367
I don't understand Captain. I never
saw that woman before last night.

1038
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:43,157
You never saw her before last night?

1039
01:25:43,261 --> 01:25:43,999
No!

1040
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,384
Then why do you think
you're getting this furlough?

1041
01:25:45,419 --> 01:25:46,662
Cause my wife had a baby.

1042
01:25:47,985 --> 01:25:50,289
Your wife had a baby.

1043
01:25:50,331 --> 01:25:53,083
Yes sir.
Here's a telegram I got.

1044
01:25:56,388 --> 01:25:58,482
Well, I think I get this now.

1045
01:25:59,132 --> 01:26:02,574
- Do you know him?
- No, but he's cute.

1046
01:26:03,729 --> 01:26:06,321
- Here's your furlough. Take it and get out.
- Thank you Captain. Yes sir.

1047
01:26:07,686 --> 01:26:11,082
- And give my love to the baby.
- Yes sir, I will sir. Thank you
Captain. Good-bye.

1048
01:26:18,217 --> 01:26:19,417
Now young lady...

1049
01:26:20,182 --> 01:26:22,262
Where is everybody?
Sergeant Puccinelli.

1050
01:26:22,497 --> 01:26:23,198
Yes sir.

1051
01:26:23,318 --> 01:26:26,030
Do you realize that this whole mess is
still up in the air? Corwin wasn't the man.

1052
01:26:26,646 --> 01:26:27,676
He wasn't sir?

1053
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:30,076
I can't understand your attitude lately.

1054
01:26:30,163 --> 01:26:32,048
I guess I'll have to take
care of this myself.

1055
01:26:32,068 --> 01:26:34,553
Get me the company roster with
the physical descriptions of the men.

1056
01:26:34,588 --> 01:26:35,534
Yes sir.

1057
01:26:58,686 --> 01:27:04,993
Well, I suppose we should introduce
ourselves. I'm Helen Palmer and this is ah...

1058
01:27:05,225 --> 01:27:06,910
Captain Caldwell's wife.

1059
01:27:08,226 --> 01:27:10,063
And, who are you?

1060
01:27:11,635 --> 01:27:13,146
I'm not quite sure.

1061
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:15,354
The Captain would like to see you.

1062
01:27:15,472 --> 01:27:19,083
- You.
- Me? Oh, but I was just in there.

1063
01:27:22,852 --> 01:27:25,930
Ernie Caldwell!
What's the meaning of this?

1064
01:27:25,965 --> 01:27:27,583
She was introduced to me as your wife.

1065
01:27:27,665 --> 01:27:28,618
Now wait a minute.

1066
01:27:28,678 --> 01:27:31,523
What do you mean when you said
you had just been in here?

1067
01:27:31,857 --> 01:27:35,473
I was just in here.
I was here last night too.

1068
01:27:36,095 --> 01:27:39,746
The desk was here, there was a
chair there and over there...

1069
01:27:39,781 --> 01:27:42,764
Now darling, this is an army matter.
It's not your affair.

1070
01:27:43,515 --> 01:27:44,968
Now young lady, what's the
meaning of this.

1071
01:27:44,986 --> 01:27:46,691
- Captain, I can...
- Sergeant Puccinelli.

1072
01:27:46,753 --> 01:27:48,143
Ernie Caldwell!

1073
01:27:48,144 --> 01:27:50,240
Can't you stay outside
until this is settled?

1074
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:52,086
If there's anything going on,
I want to know about it.

1075
01:27:52,121 --> 01:27:55,072
Then let's both get outside
and I'll try to explain.

1076
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:57,624
- I don't understand...
- But Captain.

1077
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,917
Oh come on Millie,
let's get out of here.

1078
01:27:59,952 --> 01:28:01,980
But I still don't understand.

1079
01:28:02,716 --> 01:28:05,170
Why is everybody picking on me?

1080
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:08,895
Hi ya Cutie! Well honey,
what are you doing here?

1081
01:28:08,903 --> 01:28:12,822
Well I was worried. I came over here to
ask Vic about you going on that shipment.

1082
01:28:12,857 --> 01:28:15,367
Oh don't worry.
Cutie will see that I don't go.

1083
01:28:15,676 --> 01:28:18,178
Come on, why don't you give up?
You can't win.

1084
01:28:18,213 --> 01:28:19,579
Puccinelli, we have something
that must be settled.

1085
01:28:19,614 --> 01:28:20,949
Now just a minute, sir.

1086
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:23,856
For 5 years this army has been
deciding things for me to do...

1087
01:28:23,922 --> 01:28:25,430
But I'm in the driver's seat this time.

1088
01:28:25,431 --> 01:28:27,740
I don't want to be a warrant-officer.
I want to go overseas.

1089
01:28:27,931 --> 01:28:30,094
I want to get away from everything.
Away from all this.

1090
01:28:30,095 --> 01:28:32,776
You can't dodge the issue that easily.
Besides you're not a private.

1091
01:28:32,811 --> 01:28:35,483
That sir is something else I'm
deciding. I'm busting myself.

1092
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:38,482
- You can't do that.
- I can't, but you can do it for me.
Watch.

1093
01:28:39,734 --> 01:28:42,192
- Oh honey.
- Ernie!

1094
01:28:42,227 --> 01:28:43,787
- What did you call him?
- Ernie.

1095
01:28:43,822 --> 01:28:45,957
- Did he say he was Ernie Caldwell?
- Yes.

1096
01:28:45,992 --> 01:28:47,802
- Then there is something...
- Ladies, please!

1097
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:50,041
Now if you'll just wait dear.

1098
01:28:52,341 --> 01:28:53,833
Is he the man you have been going
steady with?

1099
01:28:53,890 --> 01:28:57,384
- Oh no, I only met him last night.
- Last night?

1100
01:28:57,719 --> 01:29:00,677
Oh I think this whole thing is silly.
Let's get out of here.

1101
01:29:01,016 --> 01:29:04,081
Now then Miss. You must have
gone out with another in this company?

1102
01:29:04,116 --> 01:29:04,893
Present sir!

1103
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:10,026
So it's you Puccinelli. Well, I'm going
to give you exactly what you asked for.

1104
01:29:10,068 --> 01:29:12,157
You'll be reduced to private and
shipped overseas.

1105
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,054
Thank you sir.

1106
01:29:13,089 --> 01:29:17,049
And don't think this relieves you of
your responsibilities to this woman
you are married to.

1107
01:29:17,265 --> 01:29:19,320
- Married to me?
- Now don't deny it.

1108
01:29:19,355 --> 01:29:23,714
Oh but he isn't. I'm already
married, to someone else.

1109
01:29:23,749 --> 01:29:28,650
John Slager. Has been since a
week after I broke up with Vic.

1110
01:29:28,685 --> 01:29:30,402
Well what have you been
looking for me for?

1111
01:29:30,485 --> 01:29:33,652
Because I want to tell
you not to come to

1112
01:29:33,658 --> 01:29:36,764
see me tonight, like you
promised 4 months ago.

1113
01:29:36,799 --> 01:29:41,100
Before John and I were married.
You won't come, will you?

1114
01:29:41,135 --> 01:29:42,574
Holy Toledo, no!

1115
01:29:43,332 --> 01:29:47,564
I'm so glad. My husband
might not understand...

1116
01:29:47,796 --> 01:29:51,824
...he's not very bright and I don't
want to cause any trouble.

1117
01:29:52,351 --> 01:29:56,389
Oh well, goodbye and thanks so much.

1118
01:29:57,695 --> 01:30:00,678
- Don't think that this will clear you.
- We're still busting you.

1119
01:30:00,713 --> 01:30:03,566
Okay, so I'm busted. For once I've
beaten the army.

1120
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:05,760
While all these other guys are
rotting here in the states...

1121
01:30:05,795 --> 01:30:09,011
I'll be on the other side and the army
had nothing to do with it. I did it all myself.

1122
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:12,158
- What the devil is that?
- I don't know sir.

1123
01:30:12,325 --> 01:30:13,630
It sounds like a special call.

1124
01:30:13,634 --> 01:30:15,624
Captain Caldwell.
Did you hear the news?

1125
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:18,154
All movements, transfers
and furloughs have been cancelled.

1126
01:30:18,189 --> 01:30:19,713
- Movements cancelled.
- Sure.

1127
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:21,120
The whole outfit is going overseas.

1128
01:30:21,155 --> 01:30:23,980
- But darling, why didn't you?
- Sally never told me.

1129
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:28,190
Ernie Caldwell. Step into my office.

1130
01:30:28,225 --> 01:30:30,602
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1131
01:30:32,565 --> 01:30:33,828
Let go of me.

1132
01:30:33,863 --> 01:30:36,971
Sarge, I just caught this man
trying to sneak off the boat.

1133
01:30:37,006 --> 01:30:38,962
Don't bother me, I'm out of business.

1134
01:30:38,997 --> 01:30:41,997
Sneak off the boat nothing. I've got
a furlough. I've got to see my baby.

1135
01:30:42,032 --> 01:30:44,113
- Nobody's all got no furlough.
- I have!

1136
01:30:44,148 --> 01:30:45,464
- No you ain't.
- I have!

1137
01:30:46,057 --> 01:30:46,854
QUIET!

1138
01:30:46,855 --> 01:30:49,212
- All furloughs is cancelled.
- Cancelled!?

1139
01:30:49,247 --> 01:30:51,590
That's right, the whole
division is going overseas.

1140
01:30:51,691 --> 01:30:53,831
- Overseas?
- Come on. Let's be going.

1141
01:30:55,077 --> 01:30:56,130
Wait a minute.

1142
01:30:56,931 --> 01:30:59,571
- You too.
- Me too?

1143
01:30:59,606 --> 01:31:01,376
That's right Private Puccinelli.

1144
01:31:01,377 --> 01:31:04,560
Join your buddy. Come on.
Let's be getting on the ball.

1145
01:31:08,637 --> 01:31:10,959
- Pick it up.
- Pick what up?

1146
01:31:10,994 --> 01:31:12,060
The suitcase.

1147
01:31:12,671 --> 01:31:14,780
Private Puccinelli.

1148
01:31:21,981 --> 01:31:22,979
