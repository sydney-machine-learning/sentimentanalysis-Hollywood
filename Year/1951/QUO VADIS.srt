1
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,787
<i>This is the Appian</i> Way...

2
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,164
<i>...the most famous road
that leads to Rome...</i>

3
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,750
<i>...as all roads lead to Rome.</i>

4
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,712
<i>On this road march
her conquering legions.</i>

5
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,381
<i>Imperial Rome is the center
of the empire...</i>

6
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,802
<i>...and undisputed master
of the world.</i>

7
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,889
<i>But with this power
inevitably comes corruption.</i>

8
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,974
<i>No man is sure of his life.</i>

9
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,519
<i>The individual
is at the mercy of the state.</i>

10
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,104
<i>Murder replaces justice.</i>

11
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:17,109
<i>Rulers of conquered nations surrender
their helpless subjects to bondage.</i>

12
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,196
<i>High and low alike
become Roman slaves...</i>

13
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,906
...Roman hostages.

14
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:26,786
<i>There is no escape
from the whip and the sword.</i>

15
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,789
<i>That any force on earth
can shake the foundations...</i>

16
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,375
<i>...of this pyramid
of power and corruption...</i>

17
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:37,213
...of <i>human misery and slavery,
seems inconceivable.</i>

18
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,634
<i>But 30 years before this day,</i>
a <i>miracle occurred.</i>

19
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:47,056
<i>On a Roman cross in Judea,
a man died to make men free.</i>

20
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:51,143
<i>To spread the gospel
of love and redemption.</i>

21
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:55,147
<i>Soon that humble cross is destined
to replace the proud eagles...</i>

22
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:59,277
<i>...that now top
the victorious Roman standards.</i>

23
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:04,156
<i>This is the story
of that immortal conflict.</i>

24
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:08,369
<i>In this, the early summer
in the year 64 A.D...</i>

25
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:12,331
<i>...in the reign of the Antichrist
known to history as the Emperor Nero...</i>

26
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:16,460
<i>...the victorious 14th Legion
is on its way back to Rome...</i>

27
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:20,423
<i>...under the command
of one Marcus Vinicius.</i>

28
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:26,178
We can see Rome
from the top of the hill.

29
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,830
Well, there it stands. Rome.

30
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,877
Three years
is a long time, eh, Fabius?

31
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,504
Yes, Marcus, a long time.

32
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,216
Drusilla and the children.
Tonight I sleep at home.

33
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,845
Man of the family
to the bitter end.

34
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,056
It's not sleep
I'll be looking for.

35
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,809
It seems we've been given an escort.

36
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,062
The least they could do.

37
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,400
Hail, Marcus Vinicius...

38
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:25,196
...in the name of the divine Nero,
prince emperor and supreme pontiff.

39
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:26,405
Hail.

40
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,699
Captain Flavius,
Praetorian Guard, salutes you.

41
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,305
The news
of your brilliant victories...

42
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,869
...has preceded you
to Rome, commander.

43
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:33,594
We're rather anxious
to be there ourselves, captain.

44
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:34,337
Lead us in.

45
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,332
I'm sorry, commander.
I have orders.

46
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,334
Imperial orders.

47
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,508
By the body of...

48
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,927
A fine welcome
after a three-year campaign.

49
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:51,013
We're ordered to pull up and camp here
until notified to enter.

50
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,598
What for? How many days' wait?

51
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,275
I know nothing
but the orders, commander.

52
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,936
Rome loves her brave warriors.

53
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,396
Give that man 10 lashes.

54
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,773
Fall out!

55
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,526
And double it
for any more complaints.

56
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,362
Make camp here. Out of the way.

57
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,948
- Where to, Marcus?
- To the palace, where else?

58
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,116
Out of the way!

59
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,900
Commander Marcus Vinicius.
I request an audience with the emperor.

60
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:41,730
An immediate one.

61
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,150
I will report
immediately, commander.

62
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,112
Commander, sir,
if I might presume, sir...

63
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,157
...there's been much discussion
of your unsurpassed victories.

64
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,493
- Did you fight the Britons with a mass...
- We fought with our bowels.

65
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,329
- Try it sometime.
- Yes, commander.

66
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,714
Yes, well, now you have it
as I composed it.

67
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:09,008
Now, from the beginning.

68
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:14,555
<i>O lambent flames</i>

69
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:19,143
<i>O force divine</i>

70
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,354
<i>O omnivorous powers, hail</i>

71
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,774
"Omnivorous."

72
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,192
Omnipotent.

73
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,027
O omnipot... Yes.

74
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:32,364
<i>O omnipotent power, hail</i>

75
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,784
Seneca, don't you think
omnipotent is better?

76
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,160
Far better, Divinity.

77
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,163
There's no conviction
in your voice.

78
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,415
You disturb me.

79
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,171
Petronius, you're my arbiter
of elegance. Which is it?

80
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,299
I find omnipotent
most feeble, Divinity.

81
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,550
In fact, puerile.

82
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:55,304
Puerile? Feeble?

83
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:59,225
Omnivorous has your pure,
inspired imagery in it.

84
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,519
It is vivid, comprehensive.

85
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:05,022
A genius, Divinity,
should hold to his first thoughts...

86
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,941
...on any subject.

87
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,903
Petronius. Dear Petronius.

88
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,572
What would I do
without your clear insight into...

89
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,493
You clumsy toad!

90
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,539
Isn't the inner agony of my creating
enough without you carving me to bits?

91
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:22,915
Take her away.

92
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:25,918
Oh, where was I? What now?

93
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:29,213
Commander Marcus Vinicius.
He wishes an immediate audience.

94
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,631
Marcus, here?

95
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,424
Vinicius? Who is Marcus Vinicius?

96
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,302
My nephew, Divinity. Just returned
with his legions from Britain.

97
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,180
Oh, yes. Bid him enter.

98
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:41,559
There seems to be a disregard
for orders here.

99
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,145
You sent word to Vinicius
to remain outside the city.

100
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,565
So I did.
That's true, Tigellinus.

101
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,441
Does this nephew
of yours consider...

102
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,069
...that his conquests
give him a right to override my...

103
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:56,115
I cannot believe that he entered with
his army, Divinity, knowing Marcus as I do.

104
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:59,118
Doubtless he has merely come
to make obeisance and pay homage...

105
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:02,371
...to his emperor
and his god in private.

106
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,168
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

107
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,880
I fear that a natural humility
often blinds me.

108
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,590
Yes.

109
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,634
Hail Nero, emperor.

110
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:19,221
Commander, hail. Come forward.

111
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:24,685
Your proud uncle has been explaining
the impetuosity of your devotion to me.

112
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,771
It's a joy to be such an inspiration
to my commanders.

113
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,566
My loyalty and my life
always, Caesar.

114
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,401
My men have been away
a long time.

115
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,612
They have fought and died
for their emperor.

116
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,740
They have gladly accepted weeks
of forced marches to reach home.

117
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:40,659
They're anxious to see
their families, their women.

118
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,745
Just as you said, Petronius.

119
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:45,331
Such loyalty, such devotion.

120
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,875
You see Caesar, the delay in my men
reaching their homes...

121
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,668
...it's a question of morale.

122
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,545
Didn't you explain in...

123
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,298
Maybe good Tigellinus
left the reason out of his orders.

124
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:57,300
- An oversight, perhaps...
- Reasons are not given in imperial orders.

125
00:11:57,305 --> 00:12:00,137
Oh, Tigellinus, how boorish.

126
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,223
How ungrateful.

127
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,516
We desire that you wait
until you are joined...

128
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,770
...by the legions
coming from Africa and Asia...

129
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,688
...which I understand should
be a matter of hours.

130
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,606
Tomorrow you will enter
Rome in triumph.

131
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:14,026
More and more the people
need diversion these...

132
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:18,155
Or rather, shall we say
that this too is a question of morale?

133
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,032
They demand a spectacle.

134
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,702
A look at heroes.
Bear with me in this, dear commander.

135
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,123
- It is now clear to me, emperor.
- Divinity, may I retire with my nephew?

136
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,750
We have much to talk over.

137
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:30,960
Naturally.

138
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,213
I shall expect you at the feast
after the triumph, Vinicius.

139
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,882
We shall try to make it diverting.

140
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,885
An added honor, emperor.

141
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,725
Now, again.

142
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,187
No arms missing? No legs?

143
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,649
No. I picked up a good healthy slash
in the side here.

144
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:56,610
- You seem to be faring well, uncle.
- Oh, indestructible.

145
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,389
You're gonna spend
some time with me now...

146
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:00,179
...before rushing out
to your estates in Sicily?

147
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,491
I intend a full month's
relaxation in Rome.

148
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,703
And as I remember,
your house is the best place for it.

149
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,581
Marcus, I've recently purchased
several new delectable slaves.

150
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,042
There's one from Spain.
Skin like cream.

151
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,796
Hair with the sheen
of a young raven. She's yours.

152
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,881
I might stay two months.

153
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,051
Now, tonight I've arranged for you
to stay at Plautius' country place.

154
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,261
It's near your camp.

155
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,763
Aulus Plautius,
the old retired general?

156
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,223
That's a gloomy outlook.

157
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,601
I know. And his wife's not young either,
besides being virtuous.

158
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,645
Still, it's better quarters
than a tent...

159
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,525
Body of Bacchus,
I've been listening to that since noon.

160
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,903
He seems in rare voice.

161
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,409
Tell me, is it true what
I heard while I was gone?

162
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:44,474
That he murdered
his wife and mother?

163
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,037
My dear boy, you must learn
the language of privileged government.

164
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:51,206
Let us rather say that poor Agrippina
and Octavia were removed...

165
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,791
...for the good of the empire.

166
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,960
The new wife, Poppaea,
sounds interesting.

167
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,462
A harlot for an empress.

168
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:00,174
My dear commander,
what a proletarian observation.

169
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:03,927
You must realize that a woman
has no past when she mates with a god.

170
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,097
Well, he's our emperor.

171
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,059
There are some in the senate
who are not so pleased with him.

172
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,561
They would like to replace Nero
with General Galba.

173
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:13,979
I know nothing of politics.

174
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,357
Just as long as there's money
to pay the army...

175
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,609
...Rome will stand forever,
that I'm sure of.

176
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,421
I bid you welcome, Marcus Vinicius.

177
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,631
I salute the general.

178
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:43,926
We traveled the splendid roads
you built in Britain and Gaul.

179
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:45,803
My wife, the Lady Pomponia.

180
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,180
Our house is honored
to have you as guest, commander.

181
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,432
My tribune, Fabius Nerva.

182
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,143
These young men must wish
to wash and change.

183
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,854
The baths are ready.
Will you show them, my dear?

184
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,147
This way, commander.

185
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,817
Dinner is at the 9th hour.

186
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,491
You're expecting other guests
this evening, general?

187
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,285
We're not intruding
on any festivities, I hope.

188
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,872
Oh, no.
We live a quiet life here.

189
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:26,218
"Oh, no.
We live a quiet life here."

190
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,305
Here we are, transforming ourselves
into sweet-smelling flowers...

191
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,974
...only to bloom in a hay field.

192
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,184
You know, Marcus,
Drusilla last sent word...

193
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,062
...that the oldest boy
is almost as tall as she is now.

194
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,606
When I left,
I carried him around on my shoulder.

195
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,401
That little slave from Spain
Petronius told me about...

196
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,153
...I'll let her sit on mine.

197
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,827
Speaking of things that grow,
cast your eye on this one.

198
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,205
For your bath.

199
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,417
Stand up, fellow.

200
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,464
Body of... What a prospect.

201
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,717
Tell me, what's going on in the arena
these days? Is Croton still champion?

202
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,343
I do not know.

203
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,222
You mean general Plautius never thought
of having you trained as a gladiator?

204
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,391
He'd win enough gold
to fill your sandals.

205
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,186
I do not fight.

206
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,770
You don't fight?

207
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,940
Why, with one arm strapped,
you could kill 50 Nubians an hour.

208
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:25,027
I'll speak to your master about you.
I can make you a champion.

209
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,404
It is a sin to kill.

210
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,368
Half-witted.

211
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,580
Grew so fast,
his brain hit the top of the stable.

212
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,114
"Behold, she stands
with her gown hung loose.

213
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,326
Framed is her face
in golden tresses...

214
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,954
...reflecting the milk-white beauty
of her shoulders.

215
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:21,792
So it was that Venus stood before Mars,
welcoming her lover."

216
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:26,672
Nothing do I see
that is not perfection.

217
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,384
You're in service
to this household, I take it?

218
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,718
Very much so.

219
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,096
- Your name?
- Lygia.

220
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:37,808
Lygia. Lygia, you're a windfall.

221
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:41,520
I shall sacrifice a dozen white doves
to Venus to commemorate our meeting.

222
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,190
Your sacrifice
will be in vain, commander.

223
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,611
By the gods, the old general
must know a good slave market.

224
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,198
Not only beauty,
but spirit as well.

225
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,994
There are no slaves
in this household.

226
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,038
The old general, as you call him...

227
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,834
...well, I have the honor
and the joy to be his daughter.

228
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,462
I crave your pardon.

229
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,550
Three years in the field
have dulled my perceptions.

230
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,887
Truly, I'm sorry, Lygia.
Will you forgive me?

231
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,015
You've done nothing
to ask forgiveness for.

232
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,101
See, for a long time,
the only women I've seen or known...

233
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,229
...have been poor, dull barbarians,
very uninspiring.

234
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,480
Barbarians?

235
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,692
I've heard the women of Britain and Gaul
are most beautiful.

236
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,319
Lygia, I'm forced to tell you...

237
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,322
...that the women of Britain
cover themselves with deer fat.

238
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,533
I'd say that was an understandable
desire to be warm.

239
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,454
The warmth is not transferable,
I assure you. Only in its aroma.

240
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,707
And as for the women of Gaul...

241
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:47,502
...well, their hair is like
the frazzled ends of rope.

242
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,965
Not a soft, red-gold crown
with stars in it.

243
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,594
And their palm was the hide
of a wild boar.

244
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,930
- Not like this soft...
- At least that proves they are diligent.

245
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,224
Yes, at building mud huts.

246
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,827
But not in bringing
a man's thoughts to life.

247
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,605
I'm not sorry at all.

248
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,276
- Sorry?
- That Petronius arranged my stay here.

249
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,949
If things go as fate surely meant,
the man should be decorated.

250
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:24,122
If you will excuse me,
I must decorate the table.

251
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,467
And so you see, sir,
you can understand my problem.

252
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,052
We were outnumbered at least...

253
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,846
- Well, wouldn't you say three to one?
- Easily.

254
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:44,643
I drew up the spearmen in a formation
much like the Macedonian phalanx.

255
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,728
Let me tell you,
your barbarous Briton...

256
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,147
...is as worthy an opponent
as I've ever engaged.

257
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,380
They impaled themselves
on the spearheads like meat to the spit.

258
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:55,070
We were standing
ankle deep in their blood.

259
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,657
Can you understand the strategy, Lygia?
Can you see it?

260
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,911
I can only see the awful necessity
of defending one's home.

261
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,329
Defending?

262
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,832
They were in revolt against Rome.

263
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,835
But as I say, I credit courage.

264
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:14,516
A general's daughter can surely understand
it gives no pleasure to overcome weaklings.

265
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,634
The battle loses its zest.

266
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,011
Right, general?

267
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:24,766
- I find I've outgrown that zest.
- Don't be modest, general.

268
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:29,271
Look here, you don't seem to be excited
by the glorious exploits of your legions.

269
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,523
That's an odd attitude
for a woman of Rome.

270
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,276
I am not a Roman,
I am a Lygian.

271
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:37,028
A Lygian? I thought...

272
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,448
She's our adopted daughter.

273
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:43,034
Oh, I see. Lygian, Lygia.

274
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:46,705
She was named Callina,
but she prefers to be called Lygia.

275
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:50,625
As a child, she was taken prisoner
during my campaign in Lygia.

276
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,962
- A slave, then.
- Oh, no, no. Her father was king of Lygia.

277
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,047
She was assigned to me
as a hostage.

278
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,246
We've tried to erase
the wrong done her...

279
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,619
...with the love
we have for her.

280
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,556
You should envy me
such love, commander.

281
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,727
Lygia, I envy the roof
that covers you.

282
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,021
This one or any future.

283
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,360
May a traveler interrupt
with his greetings?

284
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,489
- Paul.
- Paul, you're here.

285
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:24,159
- We've been counting the days.
- Pomponia. Lygia, dear.

286
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:28,079
One need not pray that peace be with
this house. It's written in your faces.

287
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,873
Paul, our two guests.

288
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,168
Tribune Fabius Nerva
and Commander Marcus Vinicius.

289
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,754
You must have seen their army
camped along the road.

290
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:36,963
Ah, yes.

291
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,219
- Gentlemen, our friend Paul of Tarsus.
- Our very dear friend.

292
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,597
- You mustn't let me interrupt your meal.
- We've done with it.

293
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,391
Come, let's sit in here.

294
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,103
Commander?

295
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:57,651
You must be tired, Paul.
Will you have food? A cup of wine?

296
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,445
No, thank you, my dear.
I supped along the way.

297
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,490
And the rigors of travel
always fall away rapidly here.

298
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:06,570
I take it, like us, you've just returned
from a journey of some sort.

299
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,287
Oh, yes. Antioch, Corinth.

300
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,418
- You're Greek.
- No, I'm a Jew.

301
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,964
A citizen of Rome,
though I was born in Tarsus.

302
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,550
Oh, yes, Tarsus.
North of Palestine.

303
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,973
That's correct.

304
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,804
Well, you come from a troublesome
part of the world, aren't you?

305
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,265
Much unrest
down there in the past.

306
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,560
- You're a merchant of some sort?
- No, I'm a rabbi.

307
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:36,022
Well, I'm just a heavy-skulled soldier.
What in the name of all Jupiter is a rabbi?

308
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,777
- I...
- Paul is a teacher.

309
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,739
Oh, what do you teach?

310
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,366
He teaches...

311
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:49,494
- He teaches philosophy.
- Yes.

312
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,248
Yes, I suppose you'd call it that.

313
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,668
Did you know that all this time,
I've been teaching you philosophy?

314
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,795
I don't know a great deal
about philosophy...

315
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,841
...and lovely women shouldn't have
the time to think that deeply.

316
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,469
As for me, Lygia, would you ever think
that I was fond of flowers?

317
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,513
I should like to see the garden.

318
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,474
You have the evening tour
of the camp to make, commander.

319
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:14,185
You must see
to the disposition of the men.

320
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,314
Will you excuse me?

321
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:25,155
I shall be back early.
In time for the flowers, I hope.

322
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,960
Now, tell us the things
we've been waiting to hear.

323
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,047
- Did you see Peter?
- Yes, how is our big fisherman?

324
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,341
I missed him all along the way.

325
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,302
Wherever I went,
Peter had been there before me.

326
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,180
At Antioch,
they said he'd gone on to Jerusalem.

327
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:53,224
Others said that he'd set out
for Persia and the East.

328
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,353
Finally, in Corinth,
I learned he was on his way here...

329
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,688
...and that he would come
to us any day now.

330
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:02,108
Peter? In Rome? Magnificent.

331
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,985
All of us.

332
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:08,829
To be able to speak with a man
who talked with Christ, our Lord.

333
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:11,618
I saw results of seeds
Peter has planted.

334
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,454
Green shoots are sprouting.
There will be a good harvest.

335
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:18,083
Everywhere, strangers approached
and drew the sign of the fish before me.

336
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,086
And we spoke
of the great work ahead.

337
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,880
The work is difficult
and dangerous now, Paul.

338
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:27,050
Ever since you were tried here,
even though you were acquitted...

339
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,386
...Christians
are under constant suspicion.

340
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,764
I noticed you seemed worried
in the presence of your two guests.

341
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,892
Believe me,
I would have exercised caution.

342
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,522
Though at times, I admit the desire
to cry the message aloud.

343
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:46,111
But I suppose tactics must be applied
even in the spreading of love and faith.

344
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,905
Be patient, Paul.
Your time will come.

345
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:53,243
Those two vital young men, for instance.
They are Rome.

346
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,372
If we could teach them,
we could teach the world.

347
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,585
Marcus Vinicius?

348
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,755
You are asking for miracles.

349
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,632
I am.

350
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,468
I am, indeed.

351
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:49,174
There is still nothing I see
that is not perfection.

352
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:54,846
However, if you're thinking of me,
as you undoubtedly were...

353
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,474
...do I look
that much like a fish?

354
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,105
It wasn't anything to do with you.

355
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,862
You're too lovely
to be a lonely artist, Lygia.

356
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,531
But then, I did ask you
to wait up for me.

357
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:17,827
- It was merely that I couldn't sleep.
- Nor can I.

358
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,955
I'll tell you what, Lygia.
The night's still young.

359
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,276
And this place is unworthy
of our first meeting.

360
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:25,680
Let's go into the city
to Petronius' house.

361
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,421
There will be gaiety there
you've never dreamed of.

362
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:30,340
Dancers, musicians, singers.
The best in Rome.

363
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,885
My uncle's house was built
by the goddess of love herself.

364
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,679
No. No, it's too late, I...

365
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,556
I mean, it's impossible.

366
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,893
Well, we could plan it
more discreetly, perhaps.

367
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,355
What about tomorrow?
You'll come see my triumph, won't you?

368
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:46,730
And tomorrow night,
at the palace...

369
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,316
...there will be a feast
to tempt all the gods.

370
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:52,362
No. No, I don't wish
to watch your triumph.

371
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,864
I must go in now.
Good night, commander.

372
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,574
Tell me.

373
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,743
- What is it?
- What?

374
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,496
What is it you see
that you don't like?

375
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:06,376
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't attracted
by what I see, Marcus Vinicius.

376
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:10,338
- Well, then...
- It's what I hear I don't like.

377
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,676
You see, a man's fame
always brings him fresh enemies.

378
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,640
Who has been telling you
stories about me?

379
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:19,413
You have,
from your own lips.

380
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,517
Ugly stories
of conquests and bloodshed.

381
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,602
Conquest? But what's conquest?

382
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,730
It's the only method of uniting
and civilizing the world under one power.

383
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,899
- I Have to spill a little blood to do it.
- No.

384
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,278
There's a gentler
and more powerful way of doing that.

385
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,530
Without bloodshed and war.

386
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:40,034
Without slaves and captives bound in chains
to your triumphal chariots, commander.

387
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,613
There will always
have to be slaves.

388
00:27:41,638 --> 00:27:42,598
Who will do the work?

389
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,082
Paul speaks of a world
where there would be no slaves.

390
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,709
That beggar-faced philosopher...

391
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:51,379
...shouldn't be stuffing your
luscious little head with such nonsense.

392
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:55,884
How could I expect you
to understand?

393
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,428
I wish you were a slave,
as I first thought.

394
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:01,472
I'd offer a price for you.
A king's ransom for a king's daughter.

395
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,350
And taken me to your estates in Sicily
with all the others?

396
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,977
On a special ship.

397
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,563
What a way for a conqueror
to win a woman.

398
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,108
To buy her like
an unresisting beast.

399
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:15,820
What false security you must have
in your heart and soul.

400
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:19,282
In your manhood, Marcus Vinicius.

401
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:22,911
What hidden scorn
you must have for yourself.

402
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,748
You're forgetting
you're a hostage of Rome, aren't you?

403
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:33,338
Here, you, hostage,
come back here.

404
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:36,090
- No, commander.
- Out of my way.

405
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,508
I guard her, commander.

406
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:40,220
By whose orders? Who are you?

407
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:44,057
I am Ursus.
I guarded the king, her father.

408
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,475
I guard her now.

409
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,357
Guard her well,
my gray-haired colossus.

410
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,442
Guard her well.

411
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,371
Romance seems
to have been short-lived.

412
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:12,085
There's always a weapon
to bring down a flighty dove, my friend.

413
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:20,385
And please, dear Lord,
forgive me my anger and my spite.

414
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,013
I do not know what came over me.

415
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:27,892
It was temptation, perhaps.

416
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:32,063
A selfish desire that
this man might see Your light.

417
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,983
For my sake rather than for his.

418
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,030
And yet I pray that one day,
he shall feel the joy of Your love.

419
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,742
I pray with all my heart.

420
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,037
Captain, what's the delay here?

421
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,414
The emperor has not yet
appeared on the balcony.

422
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:34,292
You will hear
the trumpets, commander.

423
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,434
Gods of Rome.

424
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,478
Mighty.

425
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,438
Eternal.

426
00:30:55,605 --> 00:31:01,319
Beneath whose auspices,
Rome rules the world.

427
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,071
Hear us.

428
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,281
We worship you.

429
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,158
- We worship you!
- We worship you!

430
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,577
Venus...

431
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,329
...goddess of love.

432
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,956
- We worship you!
- We worship you!

433
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:17,668
Mars, god of war.

434
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,462
- We worship you!
- We worship you!

435
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:23,257
Juno, goddess of heaven.

436
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,593
- We worship!
- We worship!

437
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,222
Jupiter, father of the gods.

438
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,641
- We worship!
- We worship!

439
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:35,728
And Nero, his divine son.

440
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:47,865
They are impatient, Divinity.
They hunger to see you.

441
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:50,785
They're impatient?
What about my patience?

442
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:54,539
 A triumph to divert them?
Who diverts me?

443
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:58,876
I slave, I agonize for them.
I have no privacy.

444
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:02,540
You are the sun in their heavens.
Does the sun have privacy?

445
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:06,884
The sun has the night.
They expect me to shine daily. Hourly!

446
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:09,220
And for whom? For the people!

447
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:12,598
For that foul-smelling rabble!

448
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,809
It's so hot today.

449
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:18,521
This heat of Rome oppresses me.
It stifles me.

450
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,336
They demand too much!

451
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:23,866
I tell you, this mob,
this mob tortures me!

452
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,028
I hate it second
only to Rome itself!

453
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:31,075
The foul breath of that mob
floats in my house!

454
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,411
In my garden!

455
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,080
I wish...

456
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,373
Oh, I wish...

457
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,626
Your wish, Caesar.
Tell me, that I may execute it.

458
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:45,423
I wish it had but a single throat,
that mob, that I might cut it.

459
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,925
It could be done
if your wish were a command.

460
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:50,178
A typical butcher's solution.

461
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:53,900
Tigellinus would deprive you
of the one thing an artist must have:

462
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,388
- His audience.
- But they irk me, those people!

463
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:57,518
They irk me!

464
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,896
Do I live for them
or do they live for me?

465
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:04,233
Unfortunately, Caesar, as a ruler,
you must have subjects to rule.

466
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,611
Sheer population
is a necessary evil.

467
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,447
It is easy for Petronius to talk,
but the burden is on you.

468
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:14,035
On the only shoulders in the world
strong enough to bear it.

469
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,455
That's true, isn't it, Petronius?

470
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,958
It's lonely to be an emperor.

471
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,211
It is lonelier still
to be a genius.

472
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:28,723
You're the only one who understands
the complications of my tortured nature.

473
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,552
Is that not a theme
for a poem, Petronius?

474
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,138
It is a theme
for an epic, Divinity.

475
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,517
But to write it,
you must suffer it.

476
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,772
Yes.

477
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,151
Where is Poppaea?
Where is my empress?

478
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,862
Here, lord.
Always at your side.

479
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,989
Come. Petronius, you were right.

480
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:57,328
I must feel it, know it, live it.

481
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:59,580
Come, Petronius, attend me closely.

482
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,875
Attend me closely in my ordeal.

483
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:26,023
Hail Nero, son of Jupiter!

484
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,359
Look at him, my darling,
the emperor.

485
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:31,612
- Wife killer. Mother killer.
- Quiet, woman, you'll have us all...

486
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,365
Everybody knows it. He's a beast.

487
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,367
Quiet.

488
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,953
No man is a beast.

489
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,372
Look at him and know
that he is but sick.

490
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:45,960
Sick in heart and spirit,
in his soul.

491
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:51,632
You were right, Petronius.
How they love me.

492
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,968
How, indeed.

493
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:41,050
Remember, thou art only a man.

494
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:59,844
Remember, thou art only a man.

495
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,842
Marcus Vinicius.

496
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:42,928
Isn't he the one
who came to see Nero yesterday?

497
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,723
An arrogant man.
He bears watching.

498
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:50,060
From what I hear, he might bear
watching at much closer range.

499
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,938
Poppaea,
what are you muttering about?

500
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,940
Come closer.

501
00:37:55,566 --> 00:38:01,405
Look, they march as they fight.
Strong, brave, relentless.

502
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:04,033
Our unconquerable children.

503
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,036
We must take them to our breast.

504
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:09,580
Yes, my lord.

505
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,299
Well.

506
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,593
The hero at last.

507
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,805
You know, Marcus, usually one
is rather embarrassed by one's relatives...

508
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,473
...but today I was proud of you.

509
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,517
Hot work in that sun.
A hippodrome.

510
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:32,353
The emperor
positively adores you.

511
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,980
He called you his brave,
relentless child.

512
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:40,621
If you play your hand well, you can have
a military governorship. Egypt, perhaps.

513
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,367
Sit down.
Relax before you take your bath.

514
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,994
Oh, very well.

515
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:52,248
And taste this.
Straight from the vines of Olympus.

516
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:56,126
Your Sicilian vintages
will pale to nothing.

517
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:01,298
- Well?
- What's the law regarding hostages?

518
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:02,967
Hostages?

519
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,135
Yes, can they be bought,
reassigned, what?

520
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,637
Well...

521
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:09,932
I take it this hostage is female.

522
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,810
Head to toe, hip to hip.
What's the law?

523
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:15,855
When you see what I have for you,
you'll think of nothing else.

524
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,064
Now, this is the...

525
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,150
Ah, here she is.

526
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,237
Bring her here.

527
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:29,489
Your exquisite wildflower
from the hills of Spain, Marcus.

528
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:33,038
- What's her name? I've forgotten.
- You called me Eunice, my lord.

529
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,290
Silence!

530
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,083
Oh, yes.

531
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,168
Eunice.

532
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:40,838
Lift your chin, Eunice.

533
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:46,385
Did you ever see such skin, Marcus?

534
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:49,138
Turn around, slowly.

535
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,184
Flawless proportions.

536
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,187
Fold your arms
behind your head.

537
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,944
Makes one wish one
were a sculptor.

538
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:05,529
Lovely.

539
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:08,449
Enough of my collector's enthusiasm.
She's the commander's now.

540
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,367
Take her to his apartment.

541
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:12,202
I won't go.

542
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,038
What did you say?

543
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,623
Don't give me away, my lord.

544
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,709
Whip me, beat me,
but don't send me from here.

545
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:21,170
Don't send me from you, my lord.

546
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:23,297
You can stay here, girl.
I don't want you.

547
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:24,757
You don't want her?

548
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:28,344
And I refused an offer from Seneca
of six Arabian stallions.

549
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,055
Keep her, Petronius.
She's yours.

550
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,474
Well, by the body of Juno!

551
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:36,560
Nevertheless, give her five lashes
for impertinence.

552
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,354
You won't give me away, then, lord?

553
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,230
That depends on your future conduct.

554
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,983
Oh, yes.
Yes, my good lord.

555
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,529
Ply the lash carefully, now.

556
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:48,906
Don't damage her skin.

557
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:50,908
No, master.

558
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:55,454
Tell me, now,
can one purchase a hostage?

559
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:58,165
Where is this precious gem?

560
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,751
At Plautius' place.
You should see her.

561
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:03,045
A fiery young Lygian.
She throws flames at you.

562
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:05,005
A Lygian?

563
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:08,759
Yes, I do recall a child
assigned to him.

564
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,886
It was some years ago,
I'd forgotten.

565
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,888
How can I get my hands on her?

566
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:16,308
Hostages are wards of the state.
She belongs to Nero.

567
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:18,519
Perfect.
He would give me Egypt?

568
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:21,605
He can keep Egypt and give me Lygia.
We'll go to the palace.

569
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:26,276
Plautius may not be
in accord with this.

570
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,153
Well, she will be.

571
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,031
They've sentimentalized her
into an adopted daughter.

572
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,951
Philosophers, teachers, fools.

573
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:36,662
This one wasn't born to think,
she was born to feel.

574
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:42,426
But, Marcus, with Plautius regarding her
as his daughter, I mean, is this ethical?

575
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:44,586
After all, he was a general
of the empire.

576
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,964
I'll have her
if I have to abduct her.

577
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,509
I sense a certain frustration.

578
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:53,804
Is your little barbarian
entirely in sympathy with your plan?

579
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:56,724
She'll be cooing like a pigeon
in the right circumstances.

580
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:00,019
I wish I had your confidence.

581
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:04,352
I've never been able to discover
an honest warmth in any woman.

582
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:31,216
Oh, my dear, beautiful lord.

583
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,218
I love you so.

584
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:37,014
Please, how can I let you know?

585
00:42:54,031 --> 00:42:55,032
Open!

586
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,700
Open in the name of the emperor!

587
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,334
I have an order from the emperor.

588
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:07,044
- Yes?
- For the hostage, Lygia.

589
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:09,252
My orders are to take her
to the women's quarters...

590
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:10,464
...in the imperial palace.

591
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:11,673
She's not a slave.

592
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,050
She is our daughter.

593
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:15,886
My orders are to take her at once.

594
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,249
Wait here.

595
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,601
You are the hostage, Lygia?

596
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,062
Yes.

597
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,232
Welcome to Nero's house of women.

598
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,526
My name is Acte,
I am in charge here.

599
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:14,862
May I ask why I am here?

600
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:17,990
I would say you have attracted
the attention of the emperor.

601
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:20,033
And you have been commanded
to the feast.

602
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,827
But the emperor
has never seen me.

603
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:23,750
There must be some other reason.

604
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:27,964
Nero ordered you brought here,
just as I was brought here seven years ago.

605
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,086
He loved me then,
more than he knew.

606
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:34,131
Prepare the bath, oil of lilies.

607
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:37,759
Bring me the beaded cloth
from Persia, mostly blues, I think.

608
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:41,054
And, yes, the strand of fine gold
at the waist.

609
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,686
I am not honored by this.

610
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:51,231
You were brought up in the home
of Plautius' wife, Pomponia, weren't you?

611
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:53,442
Yes. Yes, do you know them?

612
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:54,818
I know of them.

613
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:58,155
- Lygia, child, listen to me.
- Yes, yes, yes, chatter, chatter, chatter.

614
00:44:58,322 --> 00:45:00,532
You'd think each one
had the hair of a queen.

615
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:04,161
Well, this one has
possibilities at least.

616
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:07,998
What were you going to tell me?

617
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:12,127
Simply that you are
the chosen guest of Nero.

618
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,755
You are in the hands
of the master of the world.

619
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:19,551
You will have to consider that
your good fortune and your fate.

620
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,110
The hostage, Lygia.

621
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,447
Aren't you coming?

622
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:43,158
The emperor did not ask me.

623
00:46:17,985 --> 00:46:20,279
She needed a poet, not a soldier,
to describe her.

624
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,906
Everything's there but the smile.

625
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,659
I leave that to you.

626
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,078
Petronius is quite right.

627
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:29,579
I wish I were a poet.

628
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:33,750
But I had you escorted here
in great honor.

629
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:36,044
I deserve a smile for that.

630
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,005
It was gracious of you.

631
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:42,467
Ten big, strong Praetorian Guards
to support my eagerness to come.

632
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,219
Well said, Lygia.

633
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:48,515
But you know a caravan of rare
merchandise is always well-guarded.

634
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:50,058
And you belong here, Lygia.

635
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,312
A king's daughter
in a royal palace.

636
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:56,606
That's something you should have
a natural appetite for.

637
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:00,777
I can tell you, you have other
natural appetites too.

638
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:03,530
Hasn't old Dull-Beard,
your philosopher friend, Paul...

639
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:05,657
...told you about those?

640
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:09,286
Or has he lived
in a cave all his life?

641
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:12,380
You should have seen my triumph today.
It was quite a display.

642
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,924
I looked for you, but then, I imagine
they had you chained to a peach tree.

643
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:21,548
Here. The panacea for all reticence.

644
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:25,969
You're right.

645
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:28,638
Your mouth has its own sweetness.

646
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,141
I know I'll find it so.

647
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:33,477
Don't look so frightened, Lygia.

648
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:36,310
I'm no heartless,
unfeeling machine of war.

649
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:39,483
I won't rush upon you
like a boulder from a catapult.

650
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:42,527
You've only to relax, smile at me a little,
and before you know it...

651
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,363
I can think of nothing...

652
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:46,745
...pray for nothing
but that this is over soon...

653
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,984
...so that you can send me
home again.

654
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,911
Home?

655
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:52,662
Yes.

656
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:04,132
Hail Nero!

657
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,511
Hail Nero!

658
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,641
Hail Nero!

659
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:22,984
Have you ever seen your emperor
and your god this close before?

660
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:28,740
No, I have never seen Nero
this close before.

661
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,184
Same faces.

662
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,395
Same noses.

663
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:00,730
All green.

664
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:04,734
Just for variety, Divine Lord,
try a ruby.

665
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,299
Is that the hostage
I brought for Vinicius?

666
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:29,968
Oh, yes. Yes, Divinity.

667
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:32,830
- Vinicius has an eye.
- She's exquisite.

668
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:34,389
You are generous, lord.

669
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:36,808
Perhaps you've overlooked
something for yourself.

670
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:38,435
Yes.

671
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:40,645
What do you think, Petronius?

672
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:42,355
Put a dress on an olive stump...

673
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:45,275
...and my poor, untutored nephew
would call it beautiful.

674
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:47,694
I know your incomparable
judgment, Divinity.

675
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:50,614
And I'll wager you've already decided,
even from here...

676
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,950
...that she is too narrow
in the hips.

677
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:57,621
Yes, yes, that's exactly
what I think.

678
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:00,123
Dear Poppaea,
one woman should never judge another.

679
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,990
She hasn't the glands for it.

680
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:05,045
Isn't that witty, Petronius?

681
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:07,589
Among the gods,
your humor is unique.

682
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:10,342
Dear Petronius.

683
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:12,302
Oh, yes.

684
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:14,638
Too narrow in the hips.

685
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:25,232
Sing for us, Divinity.
Sing for us.

686
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,195
Sing for us. Sing for us.

687
00:50:30,362 --> 00:50:33,657
I had almost come
to a tragic decision.

688
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:37,452
I had decided
not to sing for you tonight.

689
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,162
We beseech thee.

690
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:41,122
My throat hurts.

691
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:44,876
And when one has been given a divine gift,
one should not jeopardize it.

692
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:48,129
But I am not
the only one afflicted.

693
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:50,715
My empress has a headache.

694
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:53,176
And the only thing
which will bring her relief...

695
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:54,719
...is the sound of my voice.

696
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:59,140
You promised to sing,
or I would not be here.

697
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:01,142
I'm totally unprepared.

698
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:05,897
So I must compose as I sing.

699
00:51:08,906 --> 00:51:13,472
<i>O lambent flame</i>

700
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:18,464
<i>O force divine</i>

701
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:22,470
<i>O omnivorous power hail</i>

702
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:26,046
<i>None is the swifter
To bring destruction</i>

703
00:51:26,881 --> 00:51:29,902
<i>Yet, carefree as a child</i>

704
00:51:30,014 --> 00:51:33,602
<i>Thou with wild breezes playing</i>

705
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:39,603
<i>The old Troy
Shall be no more because of thee</i>

706
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:43,981
<i>Thou harvester that strips
The soil for men</i>

707
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:48,351
<i>To sow new crops</i>

708
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:54,008
<i>O lambent flame</i>

709
00:51:54,355 --> 00:52:00,459
<i>O force divine</i>

710
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:10,675
<i>O omnivorous power hail</i>

711
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:11,880
Bravo!

712
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,303
You must be content with that.

713
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,597
My throat.

714
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:38,239
Watch Croton.
He's killed over 300 opponents.

715
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,701
He could twist the head off your Ursus
before he knew what touched him.

716
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:46,257
Orpheus at this moment must be as yellow
with envy as our poet Lucan.

717
00:52:46,299 --> 00:52:48,927
I am as a candle next to the sun.

718
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,629
And you, Petronius,
what do you say?

719
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:57,847
I say that your verses are common
and fit only for the fire they celebrate.

720
00:52:58,677 --> 00:53:00,428
Farewell, Petronius.

721
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,780
What defect do you find in them?

722
00:53:02,806 --> 00:53:06,309
Well, your verses would be worthy of Ovid,
of Virgil, even of Homer.

723
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:07,977
But they are not worthy of you.

724
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:10,563
The conflagration you describe
does not blaze enough.

725
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,274
It is not all-consuming.

726
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:17,237
Had Lucan here written these verses,
I should acknowledge him a genius.

727
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:21,741
But you can create a work
such as the world has never known.

728
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:24,953
Therefore, I say this to your eyes.

729
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,247
Take greater pains.

730
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:31,126
The gods have given me a certain talent,
but they've given me something greater.

731
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:32,794
A true judge and friend.

732
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:36,464
I thought it sufficient to equal Homer.
You have opened my eyes.

733
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:39,676
Then all men, born and unborn,
are my debtors.

734
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:40,927
You're right.

735
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:43,930
My conflagration
does not burn enough.

736
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:47,517
And do you know why?

737
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,896
I've never seen a burning city.

738
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:57,444
You said one must suffer
an experience to re-create it.

739
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:00,280
A sculptor has his model.
I had no model.

740
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:03,366
To burn a city
in order to create an epic.

741
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:06,661
That's carrying the principle
of art for art's sake too far.

742
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:10,665
Soon the spring will be over.

743
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:13,334
The summer heat will begin.

744
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,297
What stenches
will arise from Rome?

745
00:54:20,175 --> 00:54:23,219
I shall move the court to Antium.

746
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,243
You did not observe
Croton's masterful stroke.

747
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:48,912
I was not the only one.

748
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:51,706
Vinicius has hardly
taken his eyes from her.

749
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:54,042
She must be truly exciting.

750
00:54:54,209 --> 00:54:57,170
I must see this for myself.

751
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,345
But it was a fair match.
It could have been one or the other.

752
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:08,723
You seemed pleased
with my gift, commander.

753
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,643
Is it enough,
in the light of your service?

754
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:14,270
Or isn't it?

755
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:16,397
Do you know, lovely one?

756
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:17,607
Has he told you?

757
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:20,401
No, Caesar,
I thought it should come from you.

758
00:55:20,944 --> 00:55:23,780
Know then, Lygia,
that I have given you to Marcus Vinicius...

759
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:25,955
...as a reward
for his devotion to me and...

760
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:27,995
...his brilliant service
on the battlefield.

761
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:31,454
Henceforth, your guardian
is no longer General Plautius.

762
00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:34,958
You belong to the household
of Vinicius.

763
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,862
On closer inspection...

764
00:55:41,052 --> 00:55:43,007
...I find it a fair reward.

765
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:46,024
Perhaps... excessive.

766
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:49,931
Except, of course,
as you so wisely observed, Divinity.

767
00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:51,808
Oh, yes.

768
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:56,312
Too narrow in the hips.

769
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,231
Let us go and greet my guests.

770
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:04,320
Now you know, Lygia.

771
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:08,032
And there were moments
when I thought I could love you.

772
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:11,500
Make use of your beauty, live it with me.
Love as you were made to love.

773
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:15,331
What difference does it make
whether I love, now that you own me?

774
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,792
You have but to give the word,
the command.

775
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:19,900
The small, empty command.

776
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:22,463
Yes, I own you.
You realize that, don't you?

777
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,060
And you realize I can
take you to my house...

778
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:25,662
...and have you flogged
until you bleed to love me?

779
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:28,136
Take me, then.
Take me to your house, anything.

780
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:31,097
Take me and you'll hear nothing from me
but a prayer for you.

781
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:32,682
- Lygia.
- Commander Vinicius.

782
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:36,352
The empress requests
your presence at once.

783
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:38,187
Very well.

784
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:40,612
Here.

785
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:43,884
Take this girl to the house
of Gaius Petronius.

786
00:56:44,027 --> 00:56:46,361
Put her in charge of Anaxander,
master of slaves there.

787
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:47,571
Yes, commander.

788
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,408
Tears have but one use, Lygia.

789
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,785
As a prelude to joy.

790
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:55,371
Remember that while you wait for me.

791
00:57:10,178 --> 00:57:13,389
You seem to have been having difficulty
in proving your ownership.

792
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,392
A young mare often enjoys
fighting the bit, empress.

793
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,772
I've always found conflict
between man and woman a waste of time.

794
00:57:20,939 --> 00:57:23,399
It consumes so much...

795
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:25,193
So much vitality.

796
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:27,654
Well said, empress.

797
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:29,906
I am not your empress.

798
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:32,951
I'm a priestess of Amon,
and you are the serpent.

799
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,994
Therefore,
poison is in your mouth.

800
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:40,013
And I have a taste
for poison, Marcus.

801
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:43,711
To change to a serpent,
that might take time.

802
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:49,008
I can bring that about.

803
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:52,887
Those are Commander Vinicius' orders.

804
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:11,364
Here. Oh, how clumsy of me.

805
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:15,711
You see, I know your symbol,
even though I'm not yet one of you.

806
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:18,037
Have courage, child.

807
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:20,707
Come along.

808
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:24,176
Bear in mind, your fate is determined
by the greatest power in this world.

809
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:26,713
His will be done.

810
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:29,192
Aulus, my dear,
you must get some sleep.

811
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:31,569
I'll call you as soon
as Ursus sends word.

812
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:34,363
We should be hearing from Ursus soon
no matter what happened.

813
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,503
Good morning.

814
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:55,093
You're right, perhaps we'd better
ignore the formalities.

815
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,678
Will you tell Lygia
I have come for her?

816
00:59:57,845 --> 01:00:00,389
We've not seen Lygia
since she was taken from us.

817
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:02,975
Bring Lygia here at once.

818
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:05,019
I tell you,
we don't know where she is.

819
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:09,649
- You're lying, general.
- I do not lie.

820
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:13,820
On my oath as a Roman officer,
so that you can understand, I do not lie.

821
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:15,905
You may search the house
if you wish.

822
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,741
You refuse to say anything more?

823
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,787
Only this: that you've violated
our hospitality...

824
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:24,664
...in the cruelest way a man could.

825
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:26,415
Hospitality?

826
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:29,001
You're overlooking
our law of hostages, aren't you?

827
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:31,921
The emperor assigned Lygia to my care.
She's my property.

828
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:34,173
You're overlooking
what's happening to Rome.

829
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,675
To the world, Vinicius.

830
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:39,220
It's such laws as this
that will tumble its foundations.

831
01:00:39,387 --> 01:00:43,933
Your emperor, your god, Nero,
bathed in his own infamy.

832
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,573
- Aulus, my dear, please.
- I understand your concern.

833
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:51,566
I hope I shall continue to forget
what I just heard, general.

834
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,442
Marcus.

835
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:56,737
My dear young Marcus.

836
01:00:56,904 --> 01:01:02,375
I want to call you that because
for all of your rank, you could be my son.

837
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:04,704
A woman of my years
is not unaware of things.

838
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:08,291
Lygia's eyes were drawn to you.
I saw that.

839
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:11,460
And they would not have been
if deep down inside of you...

840
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:14,589
...you were this cold,
this relentless.

841
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:19,719
Look in your heart, Marcus, and recognize
the truth of you that should be.

842
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:38,154
Well, as long as you return
empty-handed...

843
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:40,615
...sit down and fill
your obviously empty stomach.

844
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:43,242
They claim to know nothing of her.
Plautius is lying.

845
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,996
Forget the whole undignified whim
and come with me to Antium.

846
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:50,499
Something is strange
about Plautius and that household.

847
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,169
By the gods,
they don't even talk like Romans.

848
01:01:53,336 --> 01:01:56,672
And their friend,
a fellow from Tarsus named Paul.

849
01:01:56,839 --> 01:01:59,592
Paul, you say? Of Tarsus?

850
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:03,179
Yes, he's some fool philosopher
I met there.

851
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:06,474
Paul of Tarsus.

852
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:10,144
My poor Marcus.

853
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:12,813
This is drama for the ages.

854
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:16,025
You picked the cherished egg
in a nest of Christians.

855
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:20,112
She's a Christian,
and Christians have spirited her away.

856
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:23,532
Christians. Are they the ones
who worship some dead carpenter?

857
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:24,700
Yes, that's right.

858
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:28,162
A rebel against the state,
a Jew called Christ.

859
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:30,206
Crucified in Palestine,
as I remember.

860
01:02:30,623 --> 01:02:31,791
The sect is a secret one.

861
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,710
Consists of Jews,
Greeks, and many others...

862
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:38,297
...who meet in secret and spread
their superstitions among the Romans.

863
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:40,841
They are a constant worry
to Nero and the senate.

864
01:02:41,008 --> 01:02:42,773
Tigellinus is always
collecting a group of them...

865
01:02:42,815 --> 01:02:44,035
...from here and there
for questioning...

866
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:45,938
Well, this calls for
a detachment of Praetorians.

867
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:48,237
I'll simply tell Tigellinus
to start to search for them.

868
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:49,809
Now, wait.

869
01:02:49,976 --> 01:02:53,813
My dear boy,
that not only lacks dignity, but...

870
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,216
...these Christians
are known to be resourceful.

871
01:02:56,228 --> 01:03:00,569
An open display of force will only bury
your little hostage deeper in the nest.

872
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,030
What do you suggest?
That I join the scurvy group?

873
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:07,451
Listen, I know of a Greek,
a man called Chilo.

874
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:11,914
He's a self-styled soothsayer,
astrologer, and diviner of mysteries.

875
01:03:12,081 --> 01:03:17,131
I've no doubt he'd show the way
to your escaped Lygia before nightfall.

876
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:20,423
- Anaxander?
- Yes, master?

877
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:22,717
You know the house of Chilo?

878
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:26,178
- Yes, master.
- My nephew has urgent business there.

879
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:27,680
- Escort him.
- Yes, master.

880
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:32,768
Well, your advice has certain merit.
I'll give your Greek a chance.

881
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:36,105
- If you find her, bring her to Antium.
- I'll send you word.

882
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:46,900
You have heard, Eunice?
ls not love a madness?

883
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:52,038
Do not ask me, lord.
I am among the mad.

884
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:53,956
You love someone?

885
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,628
It was once prophesied
by an old woman...

886
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:03,215
...that both pain
and happiness would visit me.

887
01:04:03,382 --> 01:04:05,801
That's a safe prophesy
about any human.

888
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:10,806
She spoke a rhyme, in which she said
my true fate was hidden.

889
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,975
Well?

890
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:19,899
<i>Anon shall Venus rise
From out the violet Roman sea</i>

891
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:26,238
<i>And bear two lovers in her arms
Towards eternity</i>

892
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:30,618
Whom do you love? Anaxander?

893
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,039
Mirmillon?

894
01:04:36,165 --> 01:04:38,200
Oh, your beloved
is not of this house?

895
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,338
He is, my lord.

896
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:53,953
What if I said that today you should go
with me to the violet Roman sea?

897
01:04:55,935 --> 01:05:01,315
I'd swoon with happiness.
Only you haven't said it, my lord.

898
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:03,945
Then go ready yourself for Antium.

899
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:12,462
- You haven't yet swooned.
- I have no time, my lord.

900
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:15,247
I have no time.

901
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:18,256
I have no time!

902
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:23,212
Yes, yes.

903
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:27,383
Hearing all this, I vow you've come
to the right man, Marcus Vinicius.

904
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,968
Speak. Can you find this girl?

905
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:32,721
Patience, lord. I must first verify
if she is truly of this Christian breed.

906
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:36,475
- My lord, do you read Greek?
- Passably.

907
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:39,270
Look here, then.
What does that say?

908
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:45,520
- "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior."
- Exactly.

909
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:49,029
So it's the name of their dead god.
I've seen no such symbols.

910
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:51,900
Ah, but observe
the first letters of each word.

911
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:53,993
What do they spell?

912
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,747
I-C-T-H-U-S. Icthus.

913
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:01,667
The Greek word for fish.

914
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:07,882
Have you seen the symbol
of a fish in all this?

915
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:10,593
Fish. Why should I have seen a...

916
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:16,265
- She once drew one.
- Their sign of recognition.

917
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:21,103
Fish are caught with a bait
and Christians with a fish.

918
01:06:21,105 --> 01:06:21,951
How do I find her?

919
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:23,662
Where are the gatherings
of these Christians?

920
01:06:23,701 --> 01:06:25,770
They practice foul rites at night...

921
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:28,194
...in certain caves
and old ruins outside the city.

922
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,197
- Is there a gathering tonight?
- Possibly, lord.

923
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:34,575
But it is most dangerous.
There are hundreds of them.

924
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:37,794
Very well, I'll hire Croton the gladiator
to protect you. Does that suit?

925
01:06:37,836 --> 01:06:40,539
Croton? Why, yes, lord.

926
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,416
We'll meet you here at sundown.

927
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:46,670
But, my lord,
I shall need... other arms.

928
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:50,216
A small weapon
in advance, perhaps?

929
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,890
<i>Jesus Lord, sweet Jesus</i>

930
01:06:57,682 --> 01:07:00,200
- Kyrie eleison.
- Kyrie eleison.

931
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:07,400
<i>On us thy children</i>

932
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,121
- Christe eleison.
- Christe eleison.

933
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:14,283
<i>Have mercy, Lord</i>

934
01:07:14,374 --> 01:07:17,201
<i>Holy savior...</i>

935
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:23,014
You see how they gather, lord?
In stealth, like thieves and murderers.

936
01:07:25,756 --> 01:07:32,106
<i>Shed thy light on our darkness</i>

937
01:07:32,107 --> 01:07:33,301
<i>Shed thy light...</i>

938
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:37,304
- That's the man I met at her house.
- Yes, she's here, without a doubt, lord.

939
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:44,171
I baptize thee in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost.

940
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:48,274
- What's he doing now?
- They call it baptism.

941
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,777
An evil bath of black water.

942
01:07:57,366 --> 01:08:01,245
I know there are some here
who still hold back in doubt.

943
01:08:01,412 --> 01:08:03,664
A few who have not accepted baptism.

944
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,875
Our Lord Jesus understood that...

945
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:10,921
...and he welcomed questions,
as the right of free men.

946
01:08:11,547 --> 01:08:15,764
But at last, there is one among us tonight
for whom we have long waited.

947
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:19,972
Who was there when the people
gathered about Christ and questioned him.

948
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:22,808
Who heard the answers
from his own lips.

949
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:27,286
A man who saw the face of Jesus
and touched his hand.

950
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:32,151
He comes from Jerusalem.
The fisherman, Simon, called Peter.

951
01:08:32,318 --> 01:08:34,403
The first apostle of our Lord.

952
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:51,754
Unworthy though I am,
Jesus said to me:

953
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,008
"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock
I will build my church."

954
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:57,885
He has guided my feet to Rome...

955
01:08:58,052 --> 01:09:02,222
...so that together we can begin
to build his church here.

956
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:05,809
I give thanks for the faith you have in him
whom you have never seen...

957
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:09,938
...but whose voice you have heard
and answered in your hearts.

958
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:13,150
I heard his voice
by the Sea of Galilee.

959
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:15,110
My brothers and I were fishermen.

960
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:19,031
All the night through we had been fishing
and had caught nothing.

961
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,909
We were cold and very tired.

962
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:26,038
<i>As our boat was coming into the shore,
I heard someone call my name.</i>

963
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:29,208
<i>I looked up
and a man stood there.</i>

964
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:34,213
<i>At the sight of him, the cold and weariness
left me and my heart grew light.</i>

965
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:37,049
<i>I answered, "Yes, friend?"</i>

966
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:39,760
<i>And he called and asked
that he might come into our boat...</i>

967
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,923
<i>...so that he could speak better
to the people who were...</i>

968
01:09:41,948 --> 01:09:44,242
<i>...pressing
around him on shore.</i>

969
01:09:44,973 --> 01:09:46,600
<i>We bade him enter.</i>

970
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:51,355
He spoke to the people
about the Kingdom of Heaven at hand.

971
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:57,950
And suddenly, my heart leapt in my breast
and I knew that he was the Christ to come.

972
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,864
When he had finished,
he said to me:

973
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:03,992
"Go out into deep waters
and let down your nets."

974
01:10:04,493 --> 01:10:08,080
In a moment, the nets were full
as if by a miracle.

975
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,666
He looked at my wonderment and said:

976
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:16,588
"Do not be afraid. From henceforth,
you shall be a fisher of men."

977
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:19,591
He told me to follow him,
and I did.

978
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:22,678
I and my brothers, James and John.

979
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:26,223
Throughout the length and breadth
of the land, we followed him.

980
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:30,769
Others joined us until
besides himself, we were 12.

981
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:35,190
To the hungry and thirsty,
he gave food and drink.

982
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:41,703
To those who were sick and worn and weary,
he gave hope and peace.

983
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:45,576
Who but the Son of God
could have brought such gifts to man?

984
01:10:45,743 --> 01:10:49,246
Who but the Son of God could have
commanded the storm to be calm?

985
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:52,958
Who but he could have raised
Lazarus of Bethany from the dead...

986
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:56,044
...and given peace
to the heart of Mary Magdalene?

987
01:10:56,879 --> 01:11:01,655
And yet, I...
I lived to deny this man.

988
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:07,556
He himself foretold that I would
on the night of our last supper.

989
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:13,796
<i>"Lord," I had said, "I am willing
to follow you both to prison and to death."</i>

990
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,063
<i>But he answered:</i>

991
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:19,151
<i>"Peter, this night,
before the cock crows...</i>

992
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:21,737
<i>...thou shalt deny me thrice."</i>

993
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:24,615
<i>And I did.</i>

994
01:11:24,782 --> 01:11:27,910
Three times outside
the house of his judges.

995
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,746
When they accused me
of being with him, I said:

996
01:11:30,913 --> 01:11:32,915
"I know not the man."

997
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:37,002
With a curse for the weakness
of my body in the face of death.

998
01:11:37,628 --> 01:11:43,217
Then they weighed him down
with a cross and scourged him.

999
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,677
And at a place called Calvary...

1000
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:50,390
...they crucified him,
with a crown of thorns upon his head.

1001
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:54,353
But even in the midst
of his suffering, Jesus said:

1002
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,649
"Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do."

1003
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,943
Only the Son of God
could have forgiven them...

1004
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:04,279
...as he forgave me
for my denial of him.

1005
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,992
But he who raised the dead
could not be conquered by death.

1006
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:13,038
The room in which we later sat,
in silence and in sorrow...

1007
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:18,460
...was <i>filled suddenly with</i> a <i>great light
and the risen Lord stood before us.</i>

1008
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:21,839
<i>We saw his hands that the nails
had pierced and his wounded side...</i>

1009
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:25,220
<i>...and we knew indeed
that he was the Lord.</i>

1010
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,471
<i>And we heard his voice say,
"Peace be unto you."</i>

1011
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:34,518
<i>And he commanded us to preach
to all men his holy word.</i>

1012
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:39,147
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

1013
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:43,110
Blessed are they who mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

1014
01:12:43,277 --> 01:12:45,946
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

1015
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:50,826
Blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst after righteousness...

1016
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:52,411
...for they shall be filled.

1017
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:56,498
Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

1018
01:12:56,665 --> 01:13:01,670
Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.

1019
01:13:01,754 --> 01:13:03,969
Blessed are
the peacemakers...

1020
01:13:03,988 --> 01:13:07,778
...for they shall be called
the children of God.

1021
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:12,848
But beyond these things, Jesus asks us
to obey the commandments...

1022
01:13:13,015 --> 01:13:15,893
...which God gave
to the prophet Moses.

1023
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:20,188
Obey those who govern you
and the laws by which they govern you.

1024
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:22,858
Even though, under them,
you suffer cruelties...

1025
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:26,445
...and witness maliciousness
beyond your mind's dimensions...

1026
01:13:26,612 --> 01:13:29,281
...make no threat
of violence in return.

1027
01:13:30,157 --> 01:13:33,159
And in the words of Jesus,
I further say to you...

1028
01:13:33,786 --> 01:13:36,619
...whosoever shall smite thee
upon thy right cheek...

1029
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,911
...turn to him the other also.

1030
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:41,710
Love thy neighbor as thyself.

1031
01:13:41,877 --> 01:13:44,627
Whatsoever you would
that men should do to you...

1032
01:13:44,803 --> 01:13:47,549
...do ye even so to them.

1033
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:51,053
Love your enemies.
Bless them that curse you.

1034
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:52,888
Do good to them that hate you...

1035
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:56,850
...and pray for them that despitefully
use you and persecute you.

1036
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:59,019
Oh, believe in him.

1037
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:04,191
Endure all things in his name,
so that you may dwell in blessedness...

1038
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:08,654
...even from everlasting
to everlasting.

1039
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,323
Amen.

1040
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:13,073
- Amen.
- Amen.

1041
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:26,724
Endure all things in his name,
that you may dwell in blessedness.

1042
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:35,639
If I smite him on one cheek, the old rat
will have no chance to turn the other.

1043
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:37,523
I don't know.

1044
01:14:38,318 --> 01:14:40,876
The old rat
has courage of sorts.

1045
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:43,981
Will you both come to our house
tomorrow to see Peter and Paul?

1046
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:46,400
We must bide our time,
we may be watched.

1047
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:50,278
Good night, Father.
Good night, Mother.

1048
01:14:56,618 --> 01:14:59,621
There. There she is.

1049
01:15:12,968 --> 01:15:16,805
- Well, commander?
- Come along.

1050
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:41,802
That giant looks as though he had
the strength of a Cretan bull.

1051
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,887
- Do you think you can down him?
- I'll squeeze the seeds out of him.

1052
01:15:48,003 --> 01:15:51,423
Wait. We're being followed.

1053
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:54,301
- I don't hear anyone.
- Three times I have heard.

1054
01:15:54,468 --> 01:15:56,803
They stop when we do.
Go on to the house.

1055
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,638
- But what will...
- Go to the house.

1056
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,947
Go no further, commander.

1057
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:20,118
- Step aside.
- My lord, you haven't paid me.

1058
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:42,033
It's only a small cut in the scalp,
but they always bleed the most.

1059
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,952
Hot water.

1060
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:48,707
I'll get some ointment.

1061
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:52,377
Look. Did you do that too, Ursus?

1062
01:17:52,544 --> 01:17:54,462
No, dear. That's an old scar.

1063
01:17:54,629 --> 01:17:56,131
A scar? What from?

1064
01:17:56,298 --> 01:17:58,300
Probably some battle wound.

1065
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:01,094
That's right. He's one of Nero's
best generals, isn't he?

1066
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:03,840
Here. Come, Nazarius,
it's time you were asleep.

1067
01:18:03,847 --> 01:18:06,725
- But, Mother, did you see the big sword...
- Yes, dear.

1068
01:18:06,892 --> 01:18:10,103
- Wash the wound thoroughly first, Lygia.
- Yes.

1069
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:24,219
Come, Ursus.

1070
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:39,901
Ursus wishes to speak to you.

1071
01:19:42,154 --> 01:19:43,241
Yes?

1072
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:46,271
I want to ask
the commander's forgiveness.

1073
01:19:46,574 --> 01:19:48,076
I killed his friend.

1074
01:19:49,286 --> 01:19:50,954
You killed Croton?

1075
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:54,165
Good man. I told you you'd be a champion.
Kill the old Greek too?

1076
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:55,667
The other man disappeared.

1077
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,752
I'll wager he did, and fast.

1078
01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:59,921
Please say you'll forgive him.

1079
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:02,340
For what?
Croton faced his chances.

1080
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:04,759
Killing was his profession.

1081
01:20:04,926 --> 01:20:06,803
Of all the gods,
why didn't you kill me?

1082
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:09,347
In our faith, it is a sin to kill.

1083
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:13,351
I seem to remember.

1084
01:20:19,566 --> 01:20:21,004
He should have killed me.

1085
01:20:22,249 --> 01:20:23,789
You should
have had him kill me.

1086
01:20:23,884 --> 01:20:27,254
But instead, you bring me in
and patch me up, all of you who hate me.

1087
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:32,787
You've defeated me, Lygia.

1088
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:34,539
Go on home. Stop hiding.

1089
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:38,084
I won't come pursuing you
about the countryside any longer.

1090
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:40,628
You're free and rid of me, Lygia.

1091
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,468
You could look happier about it.

1092
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,430
Well, so be it.

1093
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:54,476
Marcus.

1094
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:57,687
Oh, Marcus,
you know I don't hate you.

1095
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:01,524
Lygia.

1096
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:06,071
- Oh, Marcus, Marcus.
- The sweetness of you.

1097
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:08,073
Oh, this is the beauty,
I knew it.

1098
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:11,334
I should have known it had to happen
when I watched you leave the gathering.

1099
01:21:14,162 --> 01:21:16,164
- You were there?
- Yes.

1100
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:20,222
I should have known what I really wished.
You with me always as my wife.

1101
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:22,545
Will you do that, Lygia?

1102
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:26,549
Will you give me the greatest triumph
a man ever had? Be my wife?

1103
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:29,761
Oh, yes, Marcus.

1104
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,475
Come now, gather what you need.
Let's be gone from this plummy den.

1105
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:37,102
- Hurry.
- Yes, Marcus, I'll hurry.

1106
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:39,979
We'll go to Antium.
Petronius will outdo himself.

1107
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:43,566
A ceremony and wedding feast
such as never has been seen.

1108
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:46,569
And even that
will be lost moments.

1109
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:55,161
Marcus, Paul will be here soon.

1110
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:59,832
I would like so much to ask his blessing
and perhaps let him say the words over us.

1111
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:02,353
What words?
You've heard enough of his words.

1112
01:22:02,358 --> 01:22:04,656
They've deafened your ears
to everything life has to tell you.

1113
01:22:04,693 --> 01:22:07,048
But you heard
Peter and Paul speak.

1114
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:09,384
Did you hear anything
that was ugly or wrong?

1115
01:22:09,551 --> 01:22:12,220
I heard a childish old man
speak in riddles.

1116
01:22:12,222 --> 01:22:13,515
Believe as they do
and you'll think a...

1117
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:17,231
...cow is a bull
and a bull is an ox and an ox is a goat.

1118
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,812
Oh, Marcus, dear.

1119
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:24,232
I thought, having heard,
you might begin to know...

1120
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:25,900
...to understand why.

1121
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:27,777
Here, now.

1122
01:22:27,944 --> 01:22:31,239
Is this the symbol
of your god, your Christ?

1123
01:22:31,406 --> 01:22:33,700
The cross on which he was crucified.

1124
01:22:33,867 --> 01:22:37,162
I'm willing to accept your god,
if it makes you happier.

1125
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:39,372
I don't demand it.

1126
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:43,084
In our gardens in Sicily, we'll put up
a big cross, higher than the roof.

1127
01:22:43,086 --> 01:22:44,999
More than that,
I'll put up a special pedestal...

1128
01:22:44,999 --> 01:22:46,879
...and crown it with a figure
of your Christ...

1129
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,673
...carved from the finest marble.

1130
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,759
Of course you'll have to have Peter
tell the sculptor what he looks like.

1131
01:22:51,926 --> 01:22:54,179
- Marcus, listen to me...
- Why not? It's no trouble.

1132
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:58,433
There's such an army of gods these days
we can always find room for another.

1133
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:06,107
I'm not asking it as a condition
of our having one another.

1134
01:23:06,274 --> 01:23:08,100
I just hope and pray
that one day...

1135
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:11,196
...the image of Christ
will appear in your heart.

1136
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,198
My heart is only for you.

1137
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,033
There won't be room for him there.

1138
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,910
There will be.

1139
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:20,955
I always carry him
in mine with you.

1140
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,919
Well, take him out
if he means that much, Lygia.

1141
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:28,630
- Do you hear me? Get rid of him.
- Well.

1142
01:23:29,297 --> 01:23:31,299
I'm glad to see you
on your feet again.

1143
01:23:31,466 --> 01:23:34,886
Last night and this morning,
you had us quite concerned.

1144
01:23:35,053 --> 01:23:36,304
Paul.

1145
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:39,641
Marcus has just asked me
to be his wife.

1146
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:43,019
I'm sure that this
has brought her great joy, Marcus.

1147
01:23:43,186 --> 01:23:46,147
You could see, Paul,
that I loved him.

1148
01:23:46,481 --> 01:23:49,025
I was just trying
to explain to him that...

1149
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:52,529
Well, that there
are other things. I mean...

1150
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,739
- I understand.
- I don't.

1151
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:57,825
I offered to accept the symbols
of her god into my house.

1152
01:23:57,992 --> 01:23:59,452
I don't ask her to accept mine.

1153
01:23:59,619 --> 01:24:02,500
What more can I do or say to prove
that I'm not an enemy of her god?

1154
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:04,415
Marcus.

1155
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:08,628
For some of us it takes months,
years of thought...

1156
01:24:08,795 --> 01:24:11,714
...of contemplation,
 of looking back on our lives...

1157
01:24:11,923 --> 01:24:14,045
...on the course of mankind
and suddenly realizing...

1158
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,094
Tell me what more I should do.

1159
01:24:16,261 --> 01:24:18,805
Well, you own slaves, do you not?

1160
01:24:18,972 --> 01:24:20,682
Hundreds. Good ones too. Why?

1161
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:23,059
Jesus wishes
no man to be in bondage.

1162
01:24:23,685 --> 01:24:25,019
You should set them free.

1163
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:27,564
Set them free?
But they're mine, I own them.

1164
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,441
But you can't buy
human beings, Marcus.

1165
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:33,027
Faith in Christ is based on love.

1166
01:24:33,194 --> 01:24:35,488
He asks all people
to love one another.

1167
01:24:35,655 --> 01:24:38,167
Yes, so I heard
your old fisherman say.

1168
01:24:38,715 --> 01:24:40,409
You want me to love
the whole human race?

1169
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:43,079
You want me to love Parthians,
Egyptians, Persians...

1170
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:45,446
...and all the rest who wanna put
a blade through my ribs?

1171
01:24:45,488 --> 01:24:47,791
Has it occurred to you
to put down your sword...

1172
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,877
...and renounce war
against these people?

1173
01:24:49,882 --> 01:24:52,625
Has it occurred to you,
that you might conquer them with love?

1174
01:24:52,677 --> 01:24:56,305
Yes. Yes, you tame a pack
of wolves with a feather.

1175
01:24:56,551 --> 01:24:58,970
It's occurred to me
you've a whining beggar for god.

1176
01:24:59,137 --> 01:25:02,849
A cringing god for slaves, aliens,
and outcasts like yourself.

1177
01:25:03,057 --> 01:25:04,934
But that's not Lygia.

1178
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:08,813
Let's be gone from this idiocy of words.
Get your cloak, Lygia.

1179
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:11,782
- Marcus, dear, a moment more.
- We've lost too much time as it is.

1180
01:25:12,067 --> 01:25:14,493
You're going to be the wife
of Commander Marcus Vinicius...

1181
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:17,176
...not the miserable slave
of some crucified carpenter.

1182
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:19,883
Oh, Marcus,
try to understand my faith,

1183
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,626
my beliefs,
my very deep beliefs.

1184
01:25:22,744 --> 01:25:25,288
Don't force me to choose.

1185
01:25:25,455 --> 01:25:28,082
You mean,
between me and your Christ?

1186
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:29,959
Yes, choose.

1187
01:25:29,961 --> 01:25:32,098
Because I'd no more
share you with your Christ...

1188
01:25:32,103 --> 01:25:33,393
...than I would
with any other man.

1189
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:35,340
But, Marcus, don't you see?

1190
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:39,979
Unless you try to understand, what we feel
for each other will destroy itself.

1191
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:42,138
Destroy us.

1192
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:46,601
My son, your love for Lygia,
great and beautiful as you feel it...

1193
01:25:46,768 --> 01:25:49,350
...is small compared
with your love for all mankind.

1194
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:52,940
What sort of love is it that acknowledges
a force greater than itself?

1195
01:25:53,107 --> 01:25:56,027
What runs in your veins, philosopher,
blood or water?

1196
01:25:56,194 --> 01:25:58,613
What sort of poison
are you spreading?

1197
01:25:59,781 --> 01:26:01,741
Are you coming with me, Lygia?

1198
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:07,747
Lygia.

1199
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:11,417
No, my dear.

1200
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:16,881
Twice today, I've been a fool.

1201
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:18,800
But I'll not go back on my word.

1202
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:22,887
You can go your way.
I'll not disclose what I've seen or heard.

1203
01:26:23,054 --> 01:26:25,640
Something is hidden
behind your meek words, philosopher.

1204
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:29,394
Yours and your fanatical fisherman's.
They strike at Rome and Roman law.

1205
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:33,910
I warn you, if ever Roman rule
is threatened, you'll feel my sword.

1206
01:26:47,954 --> 01:26:52,000
I almost...
I wanted to go with him, Paul.

1207
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,668
Lygia.

1208
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:57,088
Even our Lord knew temptation.

1209
01:26:57,255 --> 01:27:01,050
Your strength too will prevail
and be rewarded in this.

1210
01:27:01,217 --> 01:27:02,969
I know that.

1211
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:43,426
Yes, yes.

1212
01:27:43,593 --> 01:27:47,783
These will be the imperial gardens,
where the cattle market now stands?

1213
01:27:47,825 --> 01:27:49,154
Yes, Divinity.

1214
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:51,684
Each palace rising
out of its own lake...

1215
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:54,896
...surfaced with water fowl
of the rarest plumage.

1216
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:58,816
No longer will the stench of pig and oxen
rise up the slopes of the Palatine.

1217
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:02,278
No. It shall be landscaped
with Damascene roses.

1218
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:07,413
Oh, Phaon, you are an architect
who could have laid the plans of Olympus.

1219
01:28:09,577 --> 01:28:11,996
- My lord, I have brought food.
- Take it away.

1220
01:28:12,163 --> 01:28:15,041
- Yes, it comes to life...
- You've not eaten since morning, my lord.

1221
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:17,585
Be gone with it, all of you!

1222
01:28:18,419 --> 01:28:20,421
You irritate me!

1223
01:28:22,173 --> 01:28:24,175
Why do you stare at me, Acte?

1224
01:28:24,592 --> 01:28:26,219
My lord...

1225
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:28,971
...I can only say whe...

1226
01:28:30,431 --> 01:28:33,270
When all this sets
with the final sun...

1227
01:28:34,784 --> 01:28:36,670
...remember
the look of Acte.

1228
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:38,397
Why should I remember you?

1229
01:28:38,564 --> 01:28:40,399
No one loves you as I love you.

1230
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:42,068
I command you to stop loving me!

1231
01:28:42,235 --> 01:28:44,070
I cannot, lord.

1232
01:28:44,779 --> 01:28:46,572
Forgive me.

1233
01:28:48,825 --> 01:28:51,953
For years, she has been
a thorn in my flesh.

1234
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:54,080
Now that thorn will be removed.

1235
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:59,877
Henceforth, you are banished
from Rome and from my sight.

1236
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:02,880
One day, Nero, you will need me.

1237
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:07,343
And I will come to you.

1238
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:13,516
Is it not disgusting
when common bovine solicitude...

1239
01:29:13,683 --> 01:29:16,936
...replaces the fire
in a woman's body?

1240
01:29:18,312 --> 01:29:21,858
Ah, but what pulsating purity
there is in fire.

1241
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,444
My new Rome shall spring
from the loins of fire.

1242
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:29,365
A twisting, writhing,
breathing flame.

1243
01:29:32,577 --> 01:29:35,121
What do you think Petronius
will say to this?

1244
01:29:35,288 --> 01:29:37,011
You doubt his approval, my lord?

1245
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:39,379
I too remember
his strange look at the feast...

1246
01:29:39,404 --> 01:29:41,125
...when the thought
first came to you.

1247
01:29:41,294 --> 01:29:43,963
- I should be careful lest...
- No, no.

1248
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:47,216
Petronius appreciates my genius
even more than you, dear Phaon.

1249
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:49,969
It's just that he may not
fully understand the method...

1250
01:29:49,969 --> 01:29:52,286
...the means I must
use to bring this...

1251
01:29:52,311 --> 01:29:54,908
...greatest of
my accomplishments into being.

1252
01:29:57,018 --> 01:30:00,354
He seems to be
well-occupied at the moment.

1253
01:30:00,897 --> 01:30:03,252
When I have news
of Tigellinus coming,

1254
01:30:03,277 --> 01:30:05,449
I shall summon him
with the others.

1255
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:10,014
This must be disclosed to him
with intelligence.

1256
01:30:10,907 --> 01:30:14,493
With... With sincerity.

1257
01:30:18,289 --> 01:30:19,332
Yes.

1258
01:30:20,374 --> 01:30:22,043
There you are.

1259
01:30:24,003 --> 01:30:25,050
Marcus.

1260
01:30:28,049 --> 01:30:29,800
Well, it's your game.

1261
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:32,219
Only two games you've won
in three weeks, Marcus.

1262
01:30:32,386 --> 01:30:33,512
Does the play bore you?

1263
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,139
I fear I have met my superior.

1264
01:30:35,556 --> 01:30:37,892
I fear you might have met
something else.

1265
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:39,560
Other than a glare of distaste...

1266
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:42,897
...I've been given no details
concerning your sudden renunciation...

1267
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:44,774
...of your little
Christian hostage.

1268
01:30:44,941 --> 01:30:47,610
Your well-bred curiosity
now breaks its bounds, eh?

1269
01:30:48,402 --> 01:30:50,196
It shatters me.

1270
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,282
Well, uncle,
it happened quite simply.

1271
01:30:53,449 --> 01:30:57,086
Your valiant Greek led me to Lygia
and a swarming hive of idiots.

1272
01:30:57,745 --> 01:30:59,648
Their black honey choked
my mouth and I said...

1273
01:30:59,673 --> 01:31:01,624
...strange words
I never thought I would utter.

1274
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:04,543
And but for their mammoth stupidity
I should have been broken in half...

1275
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:07,000
...and dropped piecemeal
into the sewers.

1276
01:31:07,254 --> 01:31:09,715
- Fascinated?
- In a way.

1277
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:11,258
Yes?

1278
01:31:11,425 --> 01:31:14,595
The empress requests your presence
in her pavilion, commander.

1279
01:31:14,762 --> 01:31:16,097
At once.

1280
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:21,394
I leave you to your fascination.

1281
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,854
I have been summoned to mine.

1282
01:31:27,608 --> 01:31:30,277
None of this bodes well.

1283
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:32,738
My lord, wouldn't the emperor
be angry if he should...

1284
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:36,242
Poppaea's indulgences
merely stimulate him to his own.

1285
01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:38,744
But I sense a fresh
preoccupation in Nero.

1286
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:41,330
For some time now,
he has avoided me.

1287
01:31:41,497 --> 01:31:42,707
My lord is troubled?

1288
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:44,667
A doubled guard and yesterday...

1289
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:48,462
...Tigellinus and a squadron
of his butchers left for Rome.

1290
01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:51,507
I feel a strange
and heavy breeze.

1291
01:31:51,674 --> 01:31:53,801
Oh, my dear lord.

1292
01:31:54,802 --> 01:31:58,639
Even your little song
is sad with its note of death.

1293
01:31:58,806 --> 01:32:00,641
It is just words.

1294
01:32:00,808 --> 01:32:02,852
And I sing it joyfully.

1295
01:32:03,019 --> 01:32:08,295
Because love such as I feel
cannot ever die.

1296
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:17,491
As always,
your entrance is proud and aloof.

1297
01:32:17,658 --> 01:32:21,328
I come proudly, as fast as my hands
and knees will carry me.

1298
01:32:21,495 --> 01:32:24,498
And as always,
sardonic and unassailable.

1299
01:32:24,665 --> 01:32:26,167
Unassailable?

1300
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:30,935
I've never been so readily, so happily,
so expertly vanquished in my life.

1301
01:32:31,005 --> 01:32:34,800
I believe everything
except the word "vanquished."

1302
01:32:36,343 --> 01:32:39,346
I should like
to vanquish you, Marcus.

1303
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:42,933
Like the spider who eats her mate
when he is no longer a necessity?

1304
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,187
Something like that.

1305
01:32:47,354 --> 01:32:50,024
I heard today you're planning
to leave for Sicily.

1306
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:52,359
I must. Three years away,
there's much to look after.

1307
01:32:52,526 --> 01:32:55,362
Will you sail from here
or will you go via Rome?

1308
01:32:57,073 --> 01:33:00,034
Rome? That's rather
an indirect route, isn't it?

1309
01:33:00,201 --> 01:33:01,952
Then I shall be direct.

1310
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:04,789
I know about your little
Christian hostage vanishing.

1311
01:33:05,206 --> 01:33:08,250
I've eyes and ears
in the Praetorian Guard.

1312
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:10,795
And an arm or two
to fit your waist, no doubt?

1313
01:33:12,213 --> 01:33:13,714
Possibly.

1314
01:33:14,465 --> 01:33:16,050
Did you find her, Marcus?

1315
01:33:17,218 --> 01:33:18,344
Naturally.

1316
01:33:18,511 --> 01:33:21,722
Only to find myself a fool
and sever her chains, I might add.

1317
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:24,350
You severed them thoroughly?

1318
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:27,186
Thoroughly.

1319
01:33:27,645 --> 01:33:29,480
I'm glad.

1320
01:33:31,148 --> 01:33:32,775
Marcus.

1321
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,242
Because you know
how I consoled myself...

1322
01:33:38,267 --> 01:33:40,164
...when you vanished
from the feast that night.

1323
01:33:40,206 --> 01:33:41,617
Spare me names, dear empress.

1324
01:33:41,784 --> 01:33:44,578
I consoled myself
with the thought of your death.

1325
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:46,205
I fondled your bodiless head...

1326
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:49,750
...running my fingers through your hair,
making you smile and frown.

1327
01:33:50,876 --> 01:33:52,211
May I ask what stopped you?

1328
01:33:52,586 --> 01:33:56,612
It is foolish to kill those you hate,
because once dead they are beyond pain.

1329
01:33:57,258 --> 01:33:59,343
And I hated you, Marcus.

1330
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,846
I welcome your
change of heart, at least.

1331
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:05,872
But if ever she bewitches you again,
I shall know.

1332
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:08,701
And since I have
no hatred for her...

1333
01:34:09,085 --> 01:34:11,942
...I do not care
whether she feels pain.

1334
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:19,613
You'd never turn
the other cheek to me, would you?

1335
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:23,826
I don't know what you mean.

1336
01:34:26,162 --> 01:34:28,956
But my mouth is here.

1337
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:35,379
Where is Petronius?
Have you summoned him?

1338
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:37,423
- Have you called Petronius?
- Yes, Caesar.

1339
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:39,592
Well, summon him again!
Tell him I...

1340
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:41,969
As ever, I'm impatient for you.

1341
01:34:42,136 --> 01:34:43,470
I have missed you, Divinity.

1342
01:34:43,637 --> 01:34:46,640
Dear Petronius, you must forgive me
if I seem to have slighted you of late.

1343
01:34:46,807 --> 01:34:50,603
I have been steeped in my genius
beyond all description.

1344
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:53,647
I sense a fresh inspiration.

1345
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:56,317
Your senses shall leap to it.

1346
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:07,494
Attend me. Attend me, all.

1347
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,859
My lack of consideration for you
during the past few days...

1348
01:35:17,213 --> 01:35:21,517
...in keeping you from my presence,
forces me to impress upon you once again...

1349
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:25,012
...the tribulations
of the true artist.

1350
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:29,608
When I play and sing, I have visions
of things I never dreamed existed.

1351
01:35:29,934 --> 01:35:32,228
The world is mine.

1352
01:35:33,187 --> 01:35:35,022
And mine to end.

1353
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:37,650
Music opens up new worlds for me.

1354
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:40,277
Draws back the veil
from new delights.

1355
01:35:40,444 --> 01:35:42,363
I can see Olympus...

1356
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:46,200
...and a breeze blows on me
from beyond the Earth.

1357
01:35:47,117 --> 01:35:48,619
And in those moments...

1358
01:35:48,786 --> 01:35:54,527
...I, a god,
feel as diminutive as dust.

1359
01:36:00,214 --> 01:36:01,840
This is a day for sincerity.

1360
01:36:02,007 --> 01:36:04,510
Let me open my soul to you.

1361
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:07,179
You think I do not know
that there are...

1362
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:10,897
...people in Rome
who call me a matricide, a wife killer?

1363
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:13,686
Hold me a monster?

1364
01:36:13,852 --> 01:36:15,396
Tyrant?

1365
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:19,316
But there is something
they do not realize.

1366
01:36:19,733 --> 01:36:24,126
A man's acts may be cruel
while he himself is not cruel.

1367
01:36:25,906 --> 01:36:28,575
For there are moments,
my dear Petronius...

1368
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:33,497
...when music caresses my soul.

1369
01:36:33,664 --> 01:36:37,584
I feel as gentle
as a child in a cradle.

1370
01:36:40,379 --> 01:36:41,422
Believe me?

1371
01:36:41,588 --> 01:36:44,049
All men should know you
as we do, Divinity.

1372
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:47,511
Only then would they be able
to appreciate you.

1373
01:36:49,179 --> 01:36:51,098
Yet there are those
who say that I am mad.

1374
01:36:51,265 --> 01:36:53,058
I'm only seeking.

1375
01:36:53,225 --> 01:36:56,854
The flatness and misery
of common life depress me.

1376
01:36:57,021 --> 01:37:01,293
I seek because I must exceed
the stature of man in both good and evil.

1377
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:06,461
I seek because I must be greater than man,
for only then will I be the supreme artist.

1378
01:37:13,245 --> 01:37:14,398
Do you know...

1379
01:37:15,428 --> 01:37:18,093
...why I condemned
both my wife...

1380
01:37:19,126 --> 01:37:20,477
...and my mother...

1381
01:37:21,505 --> 01:37:22,848
...to death?

1382
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,820
I did it in order to lay
at the gates of an unknown world...

1383
01:37:29,136 --> 01:37:32,973
...the greatest sacrifice
a man can put there.

1384
01:37:34,058 --> 01:37:37,478
Now, I thought, doors will open...

1385
01:37:37,644 --> 01:37:41,231
...beyond which I shall catch
a glimpse of the unknown.

1386
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:45,152
Let it be wonderful.

1387
01:37:48,405 --> 01:37:50,741
Or let it be awful.

1388
01:37:52,201 --> 01:37:55,579
So long as it is uncommon.

1389
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:01,210
So now...

1390
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:05,381
...behold, dear Petronius.

1391
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:15,766
My new Rome.

1392
01:38:17,017 --> 01:38:19,269
It shall rise
in gleaming white beauty.

1393
01:38:19,436 --> 01:38:22,856
Master gem of the world's crown.

1394
01:38:23,023 --> 01:38:24,441
Shall have a new name.

1395
01:38:24,608 --> 01:38:27,194
Neropolis. City of Nero.

1396
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,363
- Magnificent! Hail, Divinity!
- You have outdone yourself.

1397
01:38:29,405 --> 01:38:31,360
Something the world
has never seen.

1398
01:38:31,365 --> 01:38:35,669
But what of the Rome
that has stood for a thousand years?

1399
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:39,415
After all, Divinity,
the old Rome, our Rome...

1400
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:43,502
...dirty and magnificent,
but still our beloved Rome...

1401
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:45,796
...it still stands.

1402
01:38:48,257 --> 01:38:49,800
Does it?

1403
01:38:51,885 --> 01:38:54,054
It still stands.

1404
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:56,515
We never thought of that, did we?

1405
01:38:57,599 --> 01:38:58,809
Or does it, Tigellinus?

1406
01:38:58,976 --> 01:39:02,479
Rome is a sea of flames!
It burns from rim to rim!

1407
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:05,274
You hear that? That is my epic!

1408
01:39:05,441 --> 01:39:10,028
To change the face of the world!
To demolish and create, and create anew!

1409
01:39:10,195 --> 01:39:11,864
Now, to your chariots, all of you.

1410
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:13,991
You shall come with me
to the funeral pyre.

1411
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:16,994
This very night you shall hear
my dirge over burning Rome.

1412
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:20,664
Its flames shall carry me
higher than the gods.

1413
01:39:21,123 --> 01:39:24,080
- All of Rome is burning?
- All but the Palatine area, naturally.

1414
01:39:24,084 --> 01:39:26,503
- What of the section across the river?
- A creeping inferno.

1415
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:29,923
- Thousands of roofs going up like tinder.
- Marcus!

1416
01:39:37,264 --> 01:39:38,765
Stop, Vinicius! Hold him!

1417
01:39:51,487 --> 01:39:55,073
Now, indeed,
Nero has his place in history.

1418
01:42:54,419 --> 01:42:56,630
Look, there's one
of Nero's soldiers!

1419
01:42:56,797 --> 01:42:59,091
He burned Rome!

1420
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:12,187
The people
in this house here...

1421
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:13,973
...the girl with the giant,
have you seen them?

1422
01:43:14,053 --> 01:43:17,573
They left.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

1423
01:43:18,819 --> 01:43:21,905
Mama! Mama!

1424
01:43:22,072 --> 01:43:23,782
Mama!

1425
01:43:23,949 --> 01:43:26,743
Mama! Mama!

1426
01:44:01,445 --> 01:44:05,282
Here, go on! Take care of her!

1427
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:17,419
The sewers!
The sewers lead to the river!

1428
01:44:17,586 --> 01:44:19,546
Into the sewers!

1429
01:45:32,118 --> 01:45:33,620
Lygia.

1430
01:45:33,787 --> 01:45:35,372
Marcus.

1431
01:45:47,467 --> 01:45:48,510
Lygia.

1432
01:45:48,677 --> 01:45:51,304
Oh, Marcus.
Marcus, I prayed to see you.

1433
01:45:52,389 --> 01:45:55,892
Marcus, Miriam is dead,
in the fire.

1434
01:45:56,059 --> 01:45:57,811
- She...
- My mother.

1435
01:45:57,978 --> 01:46:00,105
A wall fell on her.

1436
01:46:00,272 --> 01:46:02,440
We'll get you out of this, son.

1437
01:46:03,316 --> 01:46:05,569
The Praetorians
are holding the bridge.

1438
01:46:15,829 --> 01:46:17,622
Open up!

1439
01:46:18,331 --> 01:46:19,833
- Who's in command here?
- I am!

1440
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,001
Open this barricade!

1441
01:46:21,167 --> 01:46:24,311
Imperial orders! We're to keep them
from entering the Palatine area!

1442
01:46:24,713 --> 01:46:26,339
Break ranks!
Let them through!

1443
01:46:26,506 --> 01:46:27,883
Hold your line there!

1444
01:46:28,049 --> 01:46:30,733
I'm in charge here, commander,
and by the...

1445
01:46:31,845 --> 01:46:33,493
Break ranks, I say!

1446
01:47:15,764 --> 01:47:19,559
Petronius,
look what I've created!

1447
01:47:21,394 --> 01:47:25,273
Tigellinus,
my robe of grief.

1448
01:47:25,899 --> 01:47:28,652
Terpnos, lyre.

1449
01:47:32,113 --> 01:47:34,282
History will judge
my song, Petronius.

1450
01:47:34,449 --> 01:47:36,785
Will it be great enough
to match the occasion?

1451
01:47:36,952 --> 01:47:39,621
I'm seized with the sudden fear
that it will not be great enough.

1452
01:47:39,788 --> 01:47:43,917
You will be worthy of the spectacle,
as the spectacle is worthy of you.

1453
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,461
You encourage me, Petronius.

1454
01:47:46,628 --> 01:47:50,311
But I'm aware that I must compete
with those who sang of the burning of Troy.

1455
01:47:50,423 --> 01:47:53,176
My song must be greater,
just as Rome is greater than Troy.

1456
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:57,931
<i>Silence, ye spheres
Be still, ye hurtling stars</i>

1457
01:47:58,098 --> 01:48:01,768
<i>Open wide-vaulted skies above me</i>

1458
01:48:01,935 --> 01:48:04,938
<i>Now, at last, lo,
I see Olympus</i>

1459
01:48:05,105 --> 01:48:08,233
<i>And a light from its summit
Doth illumine me</i>

1460
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:11,611
<i>I am one with the gods, immortal</i>

1461
01:48:11,778 --> 01:48:15,991
<i>I am Nero
The artist who creates with fire</i>

1462
01:48:16,157 --> 01:48:19,953
<i>That the dreams of my life
May come true</i>

1463
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:22,122
<i>To the flames now
I give the past</i>

1464
01:48:22,288 --> 01:48:26,042
<i>To the flames and soil</i>

1465
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:30,213
<i>Take thou this Rome</i>

1466
01:48:30,839 --> 01:48:36,011
<i>Oh, receive her now, ye flames</i>

1467
01:48:36,177 --> 01:48:40,015
<i>Consume her as would a furnace</i>

1468
01:48:40,181 --> 01:48:43,768
<i>Burn on, O ancient Rome</i>

1469
01:48:43,935 --> 01:48:47,689
<i>Burn on, burn on</i>

1470
01:49:03,038 --> 01:49:05,373
The mob from burned areas.

1471
01:49:06,499 --> 01:49:07,959
They want to survive.

1472
01:49:08,126 --> 01:49:09,627
Who asked them to survive?

1473
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:15,008
Tigellinus.

1474
01:49:15,175 --> 01:49:19,054
The palace is fully guarded, Majesty.
They will never pass my Praetorians.

1475
01:49:23,808 --> 01:49:26,186
The night is chilly.

1476
01:49:26,352 --> 01:49:28,354
Let us withdraw.

1477
01:49:31,649 --> 01:49:35,800
Is it possible that human beings
can produce such a sound?

1478
01:49:35,987 --> 01:49:39,282
Yes, when they've been driven too far.

1479
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:52,003
- Death to Nero!
- Death to the incendiary!

1480
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:53,463
They'll break through.

1481
01:49:53,630 --> 01:49:55,882
Summon all the detachments
from the barracks!

1482
01:49:56,341 --> 01:49:58,968
Death to the incendiary!

1483
01:50:05,642 --> 01:50:08,103
They're shouting something.
What are they shouting?

1484
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:10,605
They have given you
a new title, Divinity.

1485
01:50:10,772 --> 01:50:12,857
"Incendiary."

1486
01:50:14,067 --> 01:50:16,484
I've sent for reinforcements.
I hope they arrive in time.

1487
01:50:16,486 --> 01:50:18,786
I would speak to the mob, Caesar.
Make them some promises.

1488
01:50:18,828 --> 01:50:20,532
I do not ask favors,
I confer them.

1489
01:50:20,538 --> 01:50:22,248
You go.
Speak to them in my name.

1490
01:50:22,492 --> 01:50:25,350
Not until other detachments arrive,
then I'll speak to them with steel.

1491
01:50:25,411 --> 01:50:26,746
They'd stone me to death now.

1492
01:50:26,913 --> 01:50:29,415
In what better cause
could you die?

1493
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:32,836
This was your architect's dream.
Go and tell them, Phaon.

1494
01:50:33,002 --> 01:50:34,045
This is all for them.

1495
01:50:34,212 --> 01:50:36,005
How can we admit that, Divinity?

1496
01:50:36,172 --> 01:50:37,924
You're right,
we must never admit it.

1497
01:50:38,091 --> 01:50:41,094
How can I expect that mob
to share my vision?

1498
01:50:41,302 --> 01:50:42,762
Seneca, what do you advise?

1499
01:50:42,929 --> 01:50:46,069
The mob is a wild animal,
and with an animal you cannot reason.

1500
01:50:49,394 --> 01:50:51,938
I'm surrounded by eunuchs.

1501
01:50:54,315 --> 01:50:56,317
Why do you stand aloof?
You're my counselor.

1502
01:50:56,484 --> 01:50:57,652
Why don't you counsel me?

1503
01:50:57,819 --> 01:51:00,738
Let them enter,
we shall all die.

1504
01:51:00,905 --> 01:51:04,492
All except you. You, of course,
being a god, are immortal.

1505
01:51:04,659 --> 01:51:08,079
Your levity is ill-timed, Petronius.
They'll destroy you also.

1506
01:51:08,246 --> 01:51:11,166
I do not share your passion
for self-preservation.

1507
01:51:11,332 --> 01:51:14,919
I love Rome,
and I am not eager to survive it.

1508
01:51:15,044 --> 01:51:16,882
Petronius, you're not like
these other people.

1509
01:51:16,921 --> 01:51:18,631
They think
that you're their friend.

1510
01:51:18,798 --> 01:51:20,967
Speak to them, make promises.

1511
01:51:21,134 --> 01:51:24,053
Grain, oil, wine.

1512
01:51:26,973 --> 01:51:29,559
They will take them, Nero,
without your permission.

1513
01:51:29,726 --> 01:51:31,644
Insatiable and thankless mob.

1514
01:51:31,811 --> 01:51:33,479
- What do they want?
- Justice.

1515
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:36,581
No mob ever wants justice.
They want vengeance.

1516
01:51:40,653 --> 01:51:42,488
A victim.

1517
01:51:56,502 --> 01:51:59,839
Tigellinus,
it was you who burnt Rome.

1518
01:52:00,006 --> 01:52:01,674
At your command, Nero.

1519
01:52:01,841 --> 01:52:03,843
Tigellinus, do you love me?

1520
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:06,679
- You know it, lord.
- Then prove it.

1521
01:52:06,846 --> 01:52:11,517
Go to the mob, bare your breast
to them and your guilt.

1522
01:52:11,851 --> 01:52:13,186
I would do so gladly, Nero...

1523
01:52:13,353 --> 01:52:16,940
...but I am head of the Praetorian Guard
and the Praetorians love me.

1524
01:52:17,106 --> 01:52:19,442
If I die,
they may turn against you.

1525
01:52:19,609 --> 01:52:21,819
I cannot subject you
to that danger.

1526
01:52:21,986 --> 01:52:24,489
Are you threatening me, Tigellinus?

1527
01:52:24,656 --> 01:52:28,368
Do you hear him threaten me
with the Praetorian Guard?

1528
01:52:30,286 --> 01:52:33,248
You're all willing
to desert me. I know it.

1529
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:35,750
I feel it.

1530
01:52:35,917 --> 01:52:38,211
Nero, my beloved, you were right.

1531
01:52:38,378 --> 01:52:41,464
Give the people what they want.
Give them blood and vengeance.

1532
01:52:41,631 --> 01:52:44,217
Not one victim,
but a hundred, a thousand.

1533
01:52:44,384 --> 01:52:46,177
Victims? What victims?

1534
01:52:46,344 --> 01:52:49,264
A group who worship one
they say is higher than you.

1535
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:51,808
They are the enemies
of the human race, and of you.

1536
01:52:52,475 --> 01:52:53,726
Who are these people?

1537
01:52:53,893 --> 01:52:56,187
They despise our temples
and our gods...

1538
01:52:56,354 --> 01:52:59,857
...and prophesy that the end of the world
shall be caused by fire.

1539
01:53:00,024 --> 01:53:02,819
Well, then,
make their prophesy come true.

1540
01:53:02,986 --> 01:53:04,362
Let it end for them.

1541
01:53:05,238 --> 01:53:06,239
Who are they?

1542
01:53:06,406 --> 01:53:08,157
They call themselves Christians.

1543
01:53:08,324 --> 01:53:09,867
Christians?

1544
01:53:10,034 --> 01:53:11,536
Yes, I've heard of them.

1545
01:53:11,703 --> 01:53:14,914
The empress speaks rightly, Caesar.
The people hate these Christians.

1546
01:53:15,081 --> 01:53:17,166
They are the enemies of Rome
and of the state.

1547
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:20,336
The people want vengeance, Nero.
Let them have it.

1548
01:53:20,503 --> 01:53:22,088
The people suspect you.

1549
01:53:22,255 --> 01:53:25,341
Let their suspicion turn
in this more beneficial direction.

1550
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:27,893
- Surely, my lord, you shall not...
- They should pay, Caesar.

1551
01:53:27,927 --> 01:53:29,679
They must pay.

1552
01:53:29,846 --> 01:53:31,306
Do you hear?

1553
01:53:31,472 --> 01:53:35,059
The Christians are plotting
to destroy me.

1554
01:53:36,561 --> 01:53:40,106
You have often reminded us, Nero,
of the judgment of history.

1555
01:53:40,273 --> 01:53:42,775
What will its verdict be
if you punish the innocent...

1556
01:53:42,942 --> 01:53:44,902
...and betray your own greatness?

1557
01:53:45,069 --> 01:53:47,196
Let future ages,
looking back at this time...

1558
01:53:47,363 --> 01:53:50,116
...regard Nero
with wonder and amazement.

1559
01:53:50,283 --> 01:53:53,536
Let history say,
"Nero, the ruler of the world.

1560
01:53:53,703 --> 01:53:58,849
Nero, a god, burned Rome
because he was as powerful as Jupiter.

1561
01:53:59,125 --> 01:54:03,783
He loved poetry so much
that he sacrificed Rome for a song."

1562
01:54:05,048 --> 01:54:08,217
History need not say
that the burning of Rome was good...

1563
01:54:08,384 --> 01:54:10,970
...but it must say
that it was colossal, uncommon.

1564
01:54:11,137 --> 01:54:14,807
I cannot listen to any veiled suggestion
that my emperor is a coward.

1565
01:54:14,974 --> 01:54:16,476
That is amusing.

1566
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:19,520
You, who were too cowardly
to risk your life for him yourself.

1567
01:54:19,687 --> 01:54:22,774
Petronius is right.
You refused to die for me.

1568
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:25,485
He wants to preserve your enemies.
I want to kill them.

1569
01:54:25,651 --> 01:54:28,446
- Why do you defend these people?
- I'll tell you why, my lord.

1570
01:54:28,613 --> 01:54:31,866
Because his nephew, Vinicius,
loves a Christian girl, Lygia.

1571
01:54:32,033 --> 01:54:34,777
And it may be Petronius
is himself a Christian.

1572
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:38,831
Petronius, are you a Christian?

1573
01:54:39,248 --> 01:54:41,000
I am not.

1574
01:54:41,167 --> 01:54:45,004
I have heard that the Christians
teach you to love your neighbor.

1575
01:54:45,505 --> 01:54:48,549
And as I see what men are...

1576
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:51,594
...I cannot, for the life of me,
love my fellow man.

1577
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:56,557
He does not love you, gentlemen.

1578
01:54:58,518 --> 01:55:00,728
A tablet, Phaon.

1579
01:55:00,895 --> 01:55:03,481
The people shall have
their vengeance.

1580
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:11,045
"I hereby proclaim that the guilt
of the burning of our beloved city...

1581
01:55:11,322 --> 01:55:16,119
...rests with the foul sect
which calls itself Christian.

1582
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:22,542
They have spread the lie
that it was Nero who burnt Rome.

1583
01:55:24,252 --> 01:55:27,463
I will exterminate
these criminals...

1584
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:32,343
...in a manner matching
the enormity of their crime.

1585
01:55:34,804 --> 01:55:37,849
Their punishment
will be a warning.

1586
01:55:40,435 --> 01:55:43,855
A spectacle of terror...

1587
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:47,483
...to all evil men...

1588
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:52,405
...everywhere and forever...

1589
01:55:53,281 --> 01:55:58,161
...who would harm you
or harm Rome...

1590
01:55:58,619 --> 01:56:00,096
...or harm...

1591
01:56:02,311 --> 01:56:04,101
...your emperor...

1592
01:56:07,044 --> 01:56:08,921
...who loves you."

1593
01:56:16,095 --> 01:56:19,265
Pause, Nero,
before you sign this decree.

1594
01:56:19,807 --> 01:56:23,311
Rome has given the world
justice and order.

1595
01:56:23,478 --> 01:56:26,397
Sign that, and Roman justice
will receive a blow...

1596
01:56:26,564 --> 01:56:28,566
...from which
it may never recover.

1597
01:56:28,733 --> 01:56:31,360
Condemn these Christians
and you make martyrs of them...

1598
01:56:31,527 --> 01:56:33,196
...and insure their immortality.

1599
01:56:33,696 --> 01:56:38,087
Condemn them,
and in the eyes of history...

1600
01:56:38,868 --> 01:56:40,536
...you condemn yourself.

1601
01:56:43,289 --> 01:56:46,888
When I have finished
with these Christians, Petronius...

1602
01:56:47,502 --> 01:56:53,304
...history will not be sure
that they ever existed.

1603
01:57:02,433 --> 01:57:04,185
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a sailor.

1604
01:57:04,352 --> 01:57:06,521
Nothing burns at sea.
There's too much water.

1605
01:57:06,687 --> 01:57:10,107
Nero can burn the whole ocean.

1606
01:57:12,235 --> 01:57:14,028
Marcus.

1607
01:57:18,324 --> 01:57:20,535
Did you rest well?

1608
01:57:20,701 --> 01:57:23,996
I was impatient to see the sunrise,
and here you are.

1609
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:27,875
You should have slept longer.

1610
01:57:28,042 --> 01:57:31,921
Your journey from Antium
and last night must have...

1611
01:57:32,088 --> 01:57:35,299
I've been asleep too long
in many ways, Lygia.

1612
01:57:35,466 --> 01:57:38,886
I must return to the city at once,
meet with Nerva and the others.

1613
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,849
Yes, Rome and what it stands for.

1614
01:57:44,016 --> 01:57:45,977
Something must be done
about this maniac.

1615
01:57:46,143 --> 01:57:49,063
There must be an answer to this,
quickly, decisive.

1616
01:57:50,398 --> 01:57:52,275
You do know the answer.

1617
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:54,902
You do understand.

1618
01:57:56,237 --> 01:57:59,699
There can be no turning
the other cheek now, Lygia.

1619
01:58:00,449 --> 01:58:03,578
If I have not returned
by nightfall, I'll send word.

1620
01:58:11,544 --> 01:58:13,713
Marcus Vinicius?

1621
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,383
We have not met,
but I have heard of you.

1622
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:20,344
You must realize how grateful we are
for what you have done.

1623
01:58:20,511 --> 01:58:22,722
For your concern for Lygia.

1624
01:58:22,888 --> 01:58:25,558
My only concern is for Lygia.

1625
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:32,857
Hold yourself straight, youngster.

1626
01:58:33,441 --> 01:58:35,526
A man must be a soldier.

1627
01:58:45,870 --> 01:58:47,371
I don't want to be a soldier.

1628
01:58:48,122 --> 01:58:50,166
Let's talk about our journey.

1629
01:58:50,333 --> 01:58:53,127
We'll be meeting
Paul in Greece, you know.

1630
01:58:53,294 --> 01:58:54,378
That's good.

1631
01:58:54,545 --> 01:58:57,923
You will like Greece, Nazarius.
You'll help me to fish for men there.

1632
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:01,844
And I think we'll have time
to fish for fish too.

1633
01:59:02,011 --> 01:59:03,429
Are we leaving soon?

1634
01:59:03,596 --> 01:59:07,224
As soon as we eat.
We shall be starting within the hour.

1635
01:59:08,434 --> 01:59:09,746
I'm glad...

1636
01:59:10,817 --> 01:59:13,034
...because
I don't like it here anymore.

1637
01:59:16,067 --> 01:59:18,361
Yes, indeed.

1638
01:59:18,527 --> 01:59:21,197
We shall be fishermen together.

1639
01:59:51,936 --> 01:59:55,523
Please, my lord,
do not trouble yourself so.

1640
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:58,651
It is a moment for thought, Eunice.

1641
01:59:59,026 --> 02:00:03,114
Yesterday, I could have gone to the mob
and told them that Nero burned Rome.

1642
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,908
I could've offered them
a new emperor in General Galba...

1643
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:09,100
...and so set my seal
upon the times.

1644
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:13,249
But I did not.

1645
02:00:14,333 --> 02:00:16,001
Do you know why, Eunice?

1646
02:00:16,335 --> 02:00:18,671
I know nothing
of these things, my lord.

1647
02:00:19,130 --> 02:00:21,882
Because I love Nero, perhaps?

1648
02:00:22,341 --> 02:00:25,261
He fills me with loathing.

1649
02:00:25,886 --> 02:00:29,388
No, because out of force
of long habit...

1650
02:00:29,390 --> 02:00:32,351
...I've become content
only to be an amused cynic...

1651
02:00:32,518 --> 02:00:36,281
...a selfish onlooker,
leaving others to shape the world.

1652
02:00:40,985 --> 02:00:42,319
Marcus.

1653
02:00:42,486 --> 02:00:44,530
Gods be praised.
I was worried about you.

1654
02:00:44,697 --> 02:00:47,533
You know Nerva, here.
My third in command, Justin Scipio.

1655
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:50,453
We meet in
a ghastly hour, gentlemen.

1656
02:00:50,619 --> 02:00:52,329
We've made our decision.

1657
02:00:52,496 --> 02:00:55,374
The time has come
for Galba to replace Nero.

1658
02:00:55,374 --> 02:00:57,376
Justin is taking this message
to him and tasked me...

1659
02:00:57,380 --> 02:01:00,049
...asking him to come
with his legions in all haste.

1660
02:01:00,379 --> 02:01:04,368
Your signature added to these
will make Galba confident of his reception.

1661
02:01:05,134 --> 02:01:07,261
I know you will give it.

1662
02:01:13,601 --> 02:01:16,395
I sign it with humility.

1663
02:01:21,859 --> 02:01:23,527
On your way.

1664
02:01:25,613 --> 02:01:27,239
You took a risk in coming here.

1665
02:01:27,406 --> 02:01:29,784
You're a marked man.
You scorned Poppaea.

1666
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:32,161
She has death in her eye
for you and your Lygia.

1667
02:01:32,328 --> 02:01:33,621
I'll chance that.

1668
02:01:33,788 --> 02:01:36,499
Take Lygia and leave Rome
as quickly as possible.

1669
02:01:36,665 --> 02:01:39,752
At least you'll be spared
Nero's final horror.

1670
02:01:39,919 --> 02:01:43,255
He is about to extinguish
his conflagration in a sea of blood.

1671
02:01:44,048 --> 02:01:45,257
Whose blood?

1672
02:01:45,424 --> 02:01:47,843
Did you not hear his orators
at the street corners?

1673
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:51,639
Already the people are being given
the story, along with grain and wine...

1674
02:01:51,806 --> 02:01:55,768
...that it was the Christians
and not Nero who set fire to Rome.

1675
02:01:55,935 --> 02:01:58,646
- They won't believe such a lie.
- But they are believing it.

1676
02:01:58,813 --> 02:02:02,441
People will believe any lie
if it is fantastic enough.

1677
02:02:03,901 --> 02:02:06,028
I'll meet you
at your house by midday.

1678
02:02:06,195 --> 02:02:08,280
We will keep you informed.

1679
02:02:15,538 --> 02:02:17,873
Farewell, Marcus.

1680
02:02:18,582 --> 02:02:20,084
Farewell.

1681
02:02:20,751 --> 02:02:22,503
Farewell?

1682
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:24,296
What do you mean, my lord?

1683
02:02:24,463 --> 02:02:28,980
My dear, this morning Nero sent
to inquire after my health.

1684
02:02:29,218 --> 02:02:32,346
A Praetorian officer
brought his solicitude.

1685
02:02:32,513 --> 02:02:34,849
It is easy to see
that he means to amuse himself...

1686
02:02:35,015 --> 02:02:37,142
...by making a sport
of my extermination.

1687
02:02:37,309 --> 02:02:40,020
- But then you must...
- No, no, my dear.

1688
02:02:40,187 --> 02:02:42,857
I have the means
to disappoint him.

1689
02:02:43,315 --> 02:02:45,693
Send Anaxander to me.

1690
02:02:47,486 --> 02:02:51,156
I will give him the names
of those few I love.

1691
02:02:52,366 --> 02:02:55,127
He will go and ask them
to dine with us tonight.

1692
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:01,307
General Plautius,
his family, where are they?

1693
02:03:01,311 --> 02:03:04,027
You're late if you want them.
Nero already imprisoned them.

1694
02:03:04,169 --> 02:03:06,714
The Praetorians came
and collected the whole scurvy lot.

1695
02:03:06,881 --> 02:03:10,551
Me, raising my children
right by the house of dirty Christians.

1696
02:03:10,718 --> 02:03:13,721
Burn the city, will they?

1697
02:03:16,348 --> 02:03:18,350
Put them in Number 4.

1698
02:03:22,855 --> 02:03:25,524
Have you the family
of General Plautius here?

1699
02:03:26,567 --> 02:03:29,570
I do not know, commander.
See if we have them.

1700
02:03:29,737 --> 02:03:31,739
Have an order
for their immediate release.

1701
02:03:31,906 --> 02:03:33,574
A signed order? By whom?

1702
02:03:33,741 --> 02:03:37,703
I do not accept questions, Praetorian.
I transmit orders.

1703
02:03:42,124 --> 02:03:44,877
A seasoned campaigner
trapped by love.

1704
02:03:45,044 --> 02:03:47,212
We've been expecting you.

1705
02:03:47,379 --> 02:03:50,382
As soldiers, we've always hoped
to die a quick and noble death...

1706
02:03:50,549 --> 02:03:51,634
...haven't we, Vinicius?

1707
02:03:51,967 --> 02:03:54,887
But Nero has in mind for you
something more leisurely...

1708
02:03:55,054 --> 02:03:57,306
...and certainly ignoble.

1709
02:03:57,890 --> 02:03:59,808
Put him with his Christian friends.

1710
02:04:13,113 --> 02:04:14,949
Marcus?

1711
02:04:18,452 --> 02:04:21,413
Oh, why did they take you?
This is none of your doing.

1712
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:24,083
I carry my share of the blame.

1713
02:04:26,085 --> 02:04:29,380
We knew they were looking for you,
but we had no way to send warning.

1714
02:04:29,546 --> 02:04:31,674
This is a sad reward
for your friendship.

1715
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,093
Marcus,
I once accused you bitterly.

1716
02:04:34,259 --> 02:04:35,928
I'm proved wrong.

1717
02:04:36,095 --> 02:04:38,681
It's no triumph for me
to find you here.

1718
02:04:38,847 --> 02:04:40,099
General Plautius, I...

1719
02:04:49,984 --> 02:04:51,402
The lions!

1720
02:04:51,568 --> 02:04:53,445
It is the lions!

1721
02:04:53,612 --> 02:04:55,739
No, no, please, God!

1722
02:04:55,906 --> 02:04:57,574
No, I can't stand...

1723
02:04:57,741 --> 02:04:59,868
No, dear, no.

1724
02:05:00,035 --> 02:05:03,660
We must be strong in Him,
in each other.

1725
02:05:03,664 --> 02:05:04,707
Where is he, then?

1726
02:05:04,873 --> 02:05:08,085
If he is so all-powerful as you say,
why do we find ourselves here?

1727
02:05:08,252 --> 02:05:09,962
My friend, stand firm.

1728
02:05:10,129 --> 02:05:13,716
My two babies and all of our children
to be sold into slavery.

1729
02:05:13,882 --> 02:05:16,301
Is that what
the redeemer promised us?

1730
02:05:16,468 --> 02:05:18,488
Only by strength in faith...

1731
02:05:19,188 --> 02:05:21,664
...will we be able
to endure the ordeal.

1732
02:05:22,099 --> 02:05:25,853
I thank God
Peter and Paul were spared.

1733
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:30,733
But I miss their spirit
and their courage.

1734
02:05:57,509 --> 02:05:59,053
I think it's going to rain.

1735
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:02,014
We'd better look for a place
to take shelter.

1736
02:06:02,389 --> 02:06:04,808
Peter, don't you think so?

1737
02:06:05,476 --> 02:06:08,353
What troubles you?
You've hardly said anything all morning.

1738
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,689
Oh, I'm sorry, Nazarius.

1739
02:06:10,856 --> 02:06:11,899
Are you very tired?

1740
02:06:12,066 --> 02:06:14,068
Oh, my mind
is as heavy as my body.

1741
02:06:14,234 --> 02:06:17,321
There is something wrong,
with our people, perhaps.

1742
02:06:17,488 --> 02:06:18,530
I do not know.

1743
02:06:18,697 --> 02:06:21,867
It is at such times
I need our Lord's counsel.

1744
02:06:22,034 --> 02:06:24,328
There is within me a decision
that I cannot find.

1745
02:06:24,495 --> 02:06:27,414
If only he would speak to me, I...

1746
02:06:29,041 --> 02:06:33,462
Look, those treetops there,
they do not bend with the wind.

1747
02:06:33,629 --> 02:06:35,839
Yes, that is so.

1748
02:06:37,382 --> 02:06:41,512
And that sudden brightness coming,
do you see it, Nazarius?

1749
02:06:43,847 --> 02:06:46,308
It is the light of the Lord.

1750
02:06:46,475 --> 02:06:48,560
I have seen it.

1751
02:06:50,896 --> 02:06:53,565
Christ Jesus, you are here.

1752
02:06:53,982 --> 02:06:56,568
What is wrong, O Lord?

1753
02:06:56,985 --> 02:06:58,904
What should I do?

1754
02:06:59,071 --> 02:07:01,323
I am weary.

1755
02:07:01,490 --> 02:07:04,076
How should I follow thee now?

1756
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:07,800
Quo vadis, Domine?

1757
02:07:08,747 --> 02:07:11,030
Whither goest thou, Lord?

1758
02:07:14,753 --> 02:07:17,725
My people in Rome...

1759
02:07:18,778 --> 02:07:20,433
...have need of thee.

1760
02:07:23,971 --> 02:07:25,430
What did you say, Nazarius?

1761
02:07:28,058 --> 02:07:31,506
My people in Rome
have need of thee.

1762
02:07:32,354 --> 02:07:34,731
If thou desert my people...

1763
02:07:34,898 --> 02:07:38,635
...I shall go to Rome
to be crucified a second time.

1764
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:44,199
Nazarius, blessed child, speak on.

1765
02:07:44,366 --> 02:07:45,701
Speak.

1766
02:07:45,868 --> 02:07:47,995
Oh, Peter, you've stumbled. Here.

1767
02:07:48,162 --> 02:07:50,831
The words you said,
say them again.

1768
02:07:50,998 --> 02:07:52,499
I didn't say anything.

1769
02:07:52,666 --> 02:07:55,544
You said,
"If thou desert my people...

1770
02:07:55,711 --> 02:07:58,714
...I shall go to Rome
to be crucified a second time."

1771
02:07:59,423 --> 02:08:01,133
But I said nothing.

1772
02:08:04,636 --> 02:08:06,138
Yes.

1773
02:08:07,639 --> 02:08:10,642
He has again spoken to me.

1774
02:08:11,852 --> 02:08:13,270
Come, Nazarius.

1775
02:08:13,437 --> 02:08:14,479
Where are you going?

1776
02:08:14,646 --> 02:08:16,315
To Rome.

1777
02:08:34,041 --> 02:08:37,628
I have invited you
here tonight, my friends...

1778
02:08:37,794 --> 02:08:41,006
...you who have been steadfast
through the years.

1779
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:44,860
That you have come proves
not only your recklessness...

1780
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:46,511
...but your devotion.

1781
02:08:46,678 --> 02:08:48,597
You pay us too much respect.

1782
02:08:48,764 --> 02:08:52,142
We know you have the wit
to bring yourself into his favor again.

1783
02:08:53,227 --> 02:08:54,561
No.

1784
02:08:54,728 --> 02:08:56,980
Tigellinus has won.

1785
02:08:57,147 --> 02:08:59,149
Nero, our master...

1786
02:08:59,316 --> 02:09:02,152
...is at the moment anticipating
how he will make me suffer.

1787
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:05,280
But I shall deprive him
of that pleasure.

1788
02:09:05,989 --> 02:09:09,159
This is an evening of farewells.

1789
02:09:10,077 --> 02:09:11,703
Where will you go, my lord?

1790
02:09:11,870 --> 02:09:12,913
Your lord?

1791
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:16,458
You've called me that for long enough.
My name is Gaius.

1792
02:09:17,292 --> 02:09:20,879
And you've worn this emblem
of slavery for far too long.

1793
02:09:22,756 --> 02:09:24,675
Henceforth, you are legally free.

1794
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:31,607
And this villa, with its treasures,
its slaves, its gardens, will be yours.

1795
02:09:32,015 --> 02:09:33,558
Why do you say this?

1796
02:09:33,725 --> 02:09:38,441
Because this evening,
with its warmth and feeling...

1797
02:09:39,314 --> 02:09:42,401
...this evening is my signature.

1798
02:09:42,567 --> 02:09:44,903
The last flourish.

1799
02:09:47,072 --> 02:09:49,574
Tell the physician to come in.

1800
02:09:52,744 --> 02:09:55,247
It is not enough to live well.

1801
02:09:55,414 --> 02:09:56,748
One must die well.

1802
02:10:04,381 --> 02:10:06,091
No, my lord.

1803
02:10:06,258 --> 02:10:08,427
No! Please don't let him!

1804
02:10:13,265 --> 02:10:15,644
I understand
the Christians say that...

1805
02:10:15,913 --> 02:10:18,849
...death is but a transition
to a better life.

1806
02:10:20,105 --> 02:10:21,940
It will be interesting to discover.

1807
02:10:22,107 --> 02:10:23,746
Oh, my lord.

1808
02:10:24,067 --> 02:10:26,778
My dear, no tears before our guests.

1809
02:10:27,112 --> 02:10:28,447
Petronius...

1810
02:10:29,156 --> 02:10:31,173
If the Christians are right...

1811
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:34,310
...this will be
but a brief parting.

1812
02:10:34,453 --> 02:10:37,873
We can't... We can't part.

1813
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:39,151
Eunice!

1814
02:10:40,625 --> 02:10:42,461
Did you think
I could live without you?

1815
02:10:42,627 --> 02:10:44,671
No, no. Bind her wrist.

1816
02:10:45,130 --> 02:10:50,093
For the first time, Gaius,
I disobey you.

1817
02:10:51,595 --> 02:10:52,989
What have I done...

1818
02:10:53,602 --> 02:10:57,668
...that forever I should hear
the sweet thunder of your heart?

1819
02:10:58,852 --> 02:11:00,771
You have given me your love.

1820
02:11:17,287 --> 02:11:21,288
Now, my friends, I wish to write
a letter to our emperor.

1821
02:11:22,167 --> 02:11:23,794
Scribe?

1822
02:11:24,503 --> 02:11:26,630
Will you permit me?

1823
02:11:26,797 --> 02:11:29,508
Let us hear it, Petronius.

1824
02:11:31,051 --> 02:11:34,221
"To Nero, emperor of Rome...

1825
02:11:34,388 --> 02:11:39,101
...master of the world,
divine pontiff.

1826
02:11:40,477 --> 02:11:43,980
I know that my death
will be a disappointment to you...

1827
02:11:44,147 --> 02:11:48,712
...since you wished to render me
this service yourself.

1828
02:11:50,862 --> 02:11:55,584
To be born in your reign
is a miscalculation...

1829
02:11:56,368 --> 02:12:00,205
...but to die in it is a joy.

1830
02:12:00,372 --> 02:12:04,876
I can forgive you for murdering
your wife and your mother...

1831
02:12:05,043 --> 02:12:07,210
...for burning
our beloved Rome...

1832
02:12:08,099 --> 02:12:10,560
...for befouling
our fair country with...

1833
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:14,600
...the stench of your crimes.

1834
02:12:16,054 --> 02:12:18,890
But one thing I cannot forgive...

1835
02:12:19,558 --> 02:12:23,395
...the boredom of having
to listen to your verses...

1836
02:12:23,895 --> 02:12:29,580
...your second-rate songs,
your mediocre performances.

1837
02:12:30,527 --> 02:12:34,072
Adhere to your special gifts, Nero.

1838
02:12:34,239 --> 02:12:38,618
Murder and arson,
betrayal and terror.

1839
02:12:38,910 --> 02:12:41,872
Mutilate your subjects,
if you must.

1840
02:12:42,038 --> 02:12:44,580
But with my last breath,
I beg you...

1841
02:12:45,413 --> 02:12:48,457
...do not mutilate the arts.

1842
02:12:49,421 --> 02:12:54,053
Farewell,
but compose no more music.

1843
02:12:55,260 --> 02:12:57,888
Brutalize the people...

1844
02:12:58,597 --> 02:13:02,267
...but do not bore them...

1845
02:13:02,767 --> 02:13:08,028
...as you have bored
to death your friend...

1846
02:13:09,941 --> 02:13:12,527
...the late Gaius Petronius."

1847
02:13:20,285 --> 02:13:25,457
Seneca, I entrust to you
the delivery of this letter.

1848
02:13:25,624 --> 02:13:27,250
I will deliver it.

1849
02:13:49,981 --> 02:13:52,692
Farewell, Petronius.

1850
02:13:52,859 --> 02:13:57,364
With you perishes
the best of our Roman world.

1851
02:14:00,116 --> 02:14:01,743
Petronius?

1852
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:03,620
Dead?

1853
02:14:05,622 --> 02:14:07,791
By his own hand?

1854
02:14:09,084 --> 02:14:12,796
- I don't believe it.
- I witnessed it, Divinity.

1855
02:14:15,173 --> 02:14:18,635
I shall never
forgive him for this! Never!

1856
02:14:18,802 --> 02:14:21,429
Without my permission?

1857
02:14:21,596 --> 02:14:23,598
It's rebellion.

1858
02:14:24,182 --> 02:14:26,351
It's blasphemy.

1859
02:14:26,518 --> 02:14:28,812
He left you a message of farewell.

1860
02:14:31,356 --> 02:14:33,608
Then he did think of me.

1861
02:14:34,442 --> 02:14:37,362
His last thoughts were of me.

1862
02:14:38,989 --> 02:14:41,825
How I loved you, Petronius.

1863
02:14:42,158 --> 02:14:44,744
You were my one friend.

1864
02:14:44,911 --> 02:14:47,539
You alone understood my soul.

1865
02:14:48,748 --> 02:14:51,710
Tigellinus, the weeping vase.

1866
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:56,840
Who will listen to my songs now?

1867
02:14:57,841 --> 02:15:02,786
Who will appreciate
the true value of my verses?

1868
02:15:05,473 --> 02:15:08,393
I weep for you, Petronius.

1869
02:15:11,021 --> 02:15:13,356
One tear for you.

1870
02:15:16,234 --> 02:15:17,694
One for me.

1871
02:15:20,905 --> 02:15:23,825
Seal up these fruits
of my sorrow...

1872
02:15:23,992 --> 02:15:29,704
...so that posterity may know
how Nero grieved for his dearest friend...

1873
02:15:30,373 --> 02:15:33,627
...and truest critic.

1874
02:15:37,672 --> 02:15:41,134
And now for his tender words.

1875
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:05,909
Destroy!

1876
02:16:06,076 --> 02:16:09,287
Destroy his house,
every stone to dust!

1877
02:16:09,454 --> 02:16:10,955
Burn his books!

1878
02:16:11,122 --> 02:16:12,999
Slaughter his animals!

1879
02:16:13,166 --> 02:16:16,586
Kill his servants!
Male, female, eunuch, every one of them!

1880
02:16:16,753 --> 02:16:18,922
Beat his memory into the ground!

1881
02:16:48,576 --> 02:16:49,703
Where is the emperor?

1882
02:16:49,869 --> 02:16:51,830
Let Nero start the games.

1883
02:16:51,996 --> 02:16:53,748
The lions are getting hungry.

1884
02:16:55,125 --> 02:16:57,335
Bring on those house burners!

1885
02:16:57,502 --> 02:16:59,170
They're crying for blood.

1886
02:16:59,337 --> 02:17:01,381
I doubt if we can chance
anything today.

1887
02:17:01,548 --> 02:17:03,675
Nothing will change
the temper of this mob.

1888
02:17:03,842 --> 02:17:05,719
Have you heard any news
of the commander?

1889
02:17:05,885 --> 02:17:07,679
Only that he's been taken.
That's all.

1890
02:17:42,422 --> 02:17:45,842
O holy gods of Rome...

1891
02:17:46,009 --> 02:17:52,195
...in the name of Nero,
emperor and supreme pontiff...

1892
02:17:52,474 --> 02:17:55,769
...we beseech you
to receive in sacrifice...

1893
02:17:55,935 --> 02:17:59,397
...the lives of those
who sought to destroy...

1894
02:17:59,564 --> 02:18:03,568
...this sacred and eternal city.

1895
02:19:42,917 --> 02:19:44,586
Have strength as he did.

1896
02:19:44,752 --> 02:19:46,421
It will not be long.

1897
02:19:46,588 --> 02:19:50,008
Oh, dear Lord Jesus, help them.

1898
02:19:50,174 --> 02:19:51,342
Help them.

1899
02:20:00,018 --> 02:20:01,019
Don't.

1900
02:20:01,185 --> 02:20:03,438
Don't torture yourself.

1901
02:20:04,689 --> 02:20:07,734
I'll be as close to her as I can.

1902
02:20:19,287 --> 02:20:21,915
You may give the signal, Divinity.

1903
02:20:24,250 --> 02:20:27,045
Peace to the martyrs!

1904
02:20:27,462 --> 02:20:28,504
Peter.

1905
02:20:28,713 --> 02:20:31,507
Peace, peace to them.

1906
02:20:31,674 --> 02:20:33,676
Take thy children, Lord.

1907
02:20:34,052 --> 02:20:36,930
Numb their wounds,
soften their pain.

1908
02:20:37,096 --> 02:20:39,307
Give them strength, O savior.

1909
02:20:39,474 --> 02:20:40,725
Seize that man.

1910
02:20:40,892 --> 02:20:46,161
Blessed are you, my children,
who die in the name of Jesus.

1911
02:20:46,230 --> 02:20:48,566
I say to you that this day...

1912
02:20:48,733 --> 02:20:51,611
...you shall be with him
in paradise.

1913
02:20:51,778 --> 02:20:57,450
Here, where Nero rules today,
Christ shall rule forever!

1914
02:21:00,244 --> 02:21:01,579
Who is that man?

1915
02:21:01,746 --> 02:21:04,457
I think he is their leader,
a man called Peter.

1916
02:21:04,624 --> 02:21:07,001
He escaped us before.

1917
02:21:07,168 --> 02:21:10,713
But he said Christ would replace me.
What sort of...

1918
02:21:10,932 --> 02:21:15,176
<i>By the light of the dawn on a glorious...</i>

1919
02:21:15,259 --> 02:21:17,771
- They're singing.
- <i>...day</i>

1920
02:21:17,803 --> 02:21:26,403
<i>In his triumph
The Son of God arose.</i>

1921
02:21:26,617 --> 02:21:34,781
<i>And the trumpet of angels will greet him</i>

1922
02:21:34,913 --> 02:21:43,749
<i>Christ is King! Christ is King!
Hallelujah!</i>

1923
02:21:43,997 --> 02:21:50,586
<i>Lift your eyes and your hearts 
To the Glory on high</i>

1924
02:21:50,628 --> 02:21:52,964
These dogs have effrontery
even in death.

1925
02:21:53,131 --> 02:21:55,091
- The lions will sing louder, I think.
- <i>To the Lord...</i>

1926
02:21:55,099 --> 02:22:00,598
<i>...who arose on a Paschal Day</i>

1927
02:22:01,445 --> 02:22:09,366
<i>He shall reign
He shall reign erernal</i>

1928
02:23:26,766 --> 02:23:29,977
Oh, Peter, could our Lord
at least not have saved you?

1929
02:23:30,144 --> 02:23:33,448
Oh, Peter,
why did you come back?

1930
02:23:35,066 --> 02:23:37,568
It was the Lord's will.

1931
02:23:38,027 --> 02:23:39,237
Nazarius is safe.

1932
02:23:39,403 --> 02:23:41,864
Some good people sheltered him
outside the city.

1933
02:23:43,498 --> 02:23:52,004
<i>By the light of the dawn
On a glorious day</i>

1934
02:23:52,257 --> 02:24:00,299
<i>In his triumph 
The son of God arose</i>

1935
02:24:00,341 --> 02:24:05,234
Yes, sing to him as he now
opens his arms to you.

1936
02:24:05,596 --> 02:24:09,235
Sing to the welcome
of Christ, our Lord.

1937
02:24:09,277 --> 02:24:15,689
<i>Christ is King! Christ is King!
Hallelujah!</i>

1938
02:24:15,731 --> 02:24:18,776
More singing.
Why aren't they afraid?

1939
02:24:18,943 --> 02:24:20,444
They irritate me.

1940
02:24:20,611 --> 02:24:24,323
They should have been tortured first,
their insolence destroyed.

1941
02:24:24,699 --> 02:24:27,076
What of Marcus Vinicius
and the girl Lygia?

1942
02:24:27,243 --> 02:24:30,037
- Shall we bring them after these?
- Yes.

1943
02:24:30,204 --> 02:24:32,290
Alone, with one lion.

1944
02:24:32,456 --> 02:24:34,625
- The hungriest.
- Not yet, my lord.

1945
02:24:34,792 --> 02:24:38,796
I should like Vinicius
and his little flower held in reserve.

1946
02:24:38,963 --> 02:24:41,340
I am planning
something most unusual.

1947
02:24:41,507 --> 02:24:42,884
A surprise for you.

1948
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:45,219
What is it, Poppaea? Tell me.

1949
02:24:45,386 --> 02:24:47,680
It will not be a surprise, then.

1950
02:24:47,847 --> 02:24:49,640
Please, Poppaea.

1951
02:24:49,807 --> 02:24:54,774
My lord, have I ever disappointed you
in conceiving new delights?

1952
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:57,190
New thrills?

1953
02:24:58,524 --> 02:25:00,109
True.

1954
02:25:00,359 --> 02:25:01,944
You haven't.

1955
02:25:17,001 --> 02:25:18,419
Singing.

1956
02:25:18,586 --> 02:25:20,504
How can they?

1957
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:23,132
It's beyond understanding.

1958
02:25:24,008 --> 02:25:27,220
Don't have the arena
cleared at the end of the day.

1959
02:25:27,386 --> 02:25:29,847
I'm most curious.

1960
02:25:44,362 --> 02:25:46,864
No face on this one at all.

1961
02:25:48,324 --> 02:25:51,494
Oh, look,
there's another one smiling.

1962
02:25:52,245 --> 02:25:54,038
It's monstrous of them
to die smiling.

1963
02:25:54,205 --> 02:25:55,873
It's inhuman.

1964
02:25:56,374 --> 02:25:58,459
Yet they look no different
from other people.

1965
02:25:58,626 --> 02:26:01,212
The man, Peter,
he put an evil spell on them.

1966
02:26:01,379 --> 02:26:02,838
Yes.

1967
02:26:03,005 --> 02:26:04,548
The man, Peter.

1968
02:26:04,715 --> 02:26:07,718
Something singular
must be done with him.

1969
02:26:25,236 --> 02:26:26,821
Marcus.

1970
02:26:27,905 --> 02:26:29,532
Yes?

1971
02:26:30,408 --> 02:26:34,328
"Nothing do I see
that is not perfection."

1972
02:26:36,747 --> 02:26:42,005
That night you said it, even though
you were most predatory about it...

1973
02:26:43,087 --> 02:26:46,590
...even then,
my heart must have told me:

1974
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:50,469
"That is the man you will love."

1975
02:26:51,762 --> 02:26:55,602
Only, then, you wouldn't let me hear
my heart talking, Marcus.

1976
02:26:57,518 --> 02:27:00,313
I said a great deal, I remember.

1977
02:27:01,397 --> 02:27:04,275
All of it loud and empty.

1978
02:27:07,153 --> 02:27:10,865
I would so love
to have given you a son.

1979
02:27:13,034 --> 02:27:14,452
Lygia.

1980
02:27:15,369 --> 02:27:17,288
Oh, Marcus.

1981
02:27:17,705 --> 02:27:21,177
No matter what,
I want to be your wife now.

1982
02:27:22,001 --> 02:27:25,336
- Peter will say the words over us.
- Lygia, you know I...

1983
02:27:25,338 --> 02:27:28,799
I want it to be that way
before they take us...

1984
02:27:28,966 --> 02:27:33,269
...so that it will be that way
when we are together again.

1985
02:27:38,059 --> 02:27:41,854
You would never wish me
to pretend, would you?

1986
02:27:42,021 --> 02:27:43,856
Pretend?

1987
02:27:44,023 --> 02:27:46,942
That I feel myself Christian.

1988
02:27:47,818 --> 02:27:51,280
It's still strange, new.

1989
02:27:51,447 --> 02:27:53,574
Something I can't quite...

1990
02:27:54,116 --> 02:27:55,743
I mean...

1991
02:27:59,205 --> 02:28:02,416
Yes, it's proven good...

1992
02:28:02,583 --> 02:28:05,044
...full of courage, right here.

1993
02:28:06,003 --> 02:28:10,152
But there are many things
I cannot believe, understand.

1994
02:28:11,384 --> 02:28:14,303
Christ is within you, Marcus.

1995
02:28:14,804 --> 02:28:18,474
You feel him more strongly
than you know.

1996
02:28:20,893 --> 02:28:22,436
Come.

1997
02:28:31,028 --> 02:28:32,696
Peter.

1998
02:28:37,201 --> 02:28:41,327
Before I die,
I want to marry Marcus.

1999
02:28:44,917 --> 02:28:47,586
This is a holy thing, my son.

2000
02:28:49,547 --> 02:28:51,715
It concerns Lygia.

2001
02:28:52,049 --> 02:28:54,176
I look upon it as holy.

2002
02:28:57,847 --> 02:28:59,515
Marcus.

2003
02:29:00,474 --> 02:29:02,059
Lygia.

2004
02:29:02,935 --> 02:29:07,323
May he who blessed
the marriage at Cana bless you also.

2005
02:29:08,399 --> 02:29:11,402
Love one another
from this moment forward...

2006
02:29:11,569 --> 02:29:15,281
...as man and wife
in his holy name.

2007
02:29:15,781 --> 02:29:20,961
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

2008
02:29:21,328 --> 02:29:23,747
In this life and the next...

2009
02:29:23,914 --> 02:29:26,459
...now and forevermore.

2010
02:29:32,298 --> 02:29:34,008
Marcus.

2011
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:36,719
My husband.

2012
02:29:54,111 --> 02:29:55,654
Here he is, Your Majesty.

2013
02:29:55,821 --> 02:29:57,156
He meets with your approval?

2014
02:29:57,323 --> 02:29:58,365
Very much so.

2015
02:29:59,950 --> 02:30:01,827
It will be
like a fresco from Crete.

2016
02:30:01,994 --> 02:30:04,705
The maiden sacrificed
to the Minotaur.

2017
02:30:04,872 --> 02:30:07,541
It will be a spectacle
worthy of the eyes of the emperor.

2018
02:30:07,708 --> 02:30:09,251
Superb conception.

2019
02:30:12,213 --> 02:30:15,174
You seem sad and restless,
my little black friend.

2020
02:30:15,341 --> 02:30:16,675
But do not grieve.

2021
02:30:16,842 --> 02:30:20,133
I promise you a rare playmate
for your lonely horns...

2022
02:30:20,137 --> 02:30:22,181
...to fondle and caress.

2023
02:30:26,810 --> 02:30:28,771
You are the man Peter?

2024
02:30:28,938 --> 02:30:31,732
I am Simon, called Peter.

2025
02:30:33,776 --> 02:30:37,154
"The man called Peter has been heard
to preach rebellion and blasphemy...

2026
02:30:37,321 --> 02:30:39,823
...against the rule
and the divinity of the emperor.

2027
02:30:39,990 --> 02:30:43,160
It is accordingly decreed
that he be taken to Vatican Hill...

2028
02:30:43,327 --> 02:30:46,205
...where it has been confessed
he made his first preachment...

2029
02:30:46,372 --> 02:30:49,625
...to be crucified and left there
as a warning to all and any...

2030
02:30:49,792 --> 02:30:53,379
...who henceforth
wish to call themselves Christians."

2031
02:30:55,881 --> 02:30:58,562
To die as our Lord died...

2032
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:01,911
...is more than I deserve.

2033
02:31:03,472 --> 02:31:05,015
We can change that.

2034
02:31:33,711 --> 02:31:37,506
You'll notice, Divinity,
they've stopped singing.

2035
02:31:38,882 --> 02:31:40,342
They have, haven't they?

2036
02:31:52,396 --> 02:31:53,856
I seem to know that man.

2037
02:31:54,023 --> 02:31:55,065
General Plautius.

2038
02:31:55,232 --> 02:31:57,401
He conquered Parthia
and the north countries...

2039
02:31:57,568 --> 02:31:58,611
...when you were a boy.

2040
02:31:58,777 --> 02:32:02,126
Rome made him famous,
and he repaid her with treason.

2041
02:32:02,489 --> 02:32:03,866
What a dramatic reversal.

2042
02:32:04,033 --> 02:32:06,410
Now he faces his first defeat.

2043
02:32:06,577 --> 02:32:08,495
I shall write a poem.

2044
02:32:11,457 --> 02:32:12,916
People of Rome.

2045
02:32:13,876 --> 02:32:17,004
I am Aulus Plautius...

2046
02:32:17,421 --> 02:32:20,007
...once general of your armies.

2047
02:32:20,716 --> 02:32:23,344
Rome is ruled by a monster...

2048
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:27,284
...who tells you
the Christians burned Rome.

2049
02:32:28,015 --> 02:32:30,351
But he lies!

2050
02:32:31,018 --> 02:32:34,021
You lie, Nero.
You are the incendiary.

2051
02:32:35,189 --> 02:32:38,484
Nero kills Christians
to deceive you.

2052
02:32:38,651 --> 02:32:40,736
He alone is guilty.

2053
02:32:40,903 --> 02:32:44,329
I swear it by my death
and by my...

2054
02:32:51,455 --> 02:32:53,582
I begin to envy Petronius.

2055
02:32:53,749 --> 02:32:56,460
I have envied him long since.

2056
02:32:56,627 --> 02:32:59,630
I tell you, this is a horrible blot
on Roman justice.

2057
02:33:00,255 --> 02:33:02,633
The mob isn't as happy as it was.

2058
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:04,468
Have you noticed?

2059
02:33:27,739 --> 02:33:30,161
<i>Heaven's Son</i>

2060
02:33:33,252 --> 02:33:36,327
<i>Eternal Lord</i>

2061
02:33:36,689 --> 02:33:40,883
<i>Who reigns above
</i>

2062
02:33:41,591 --> 02:33:49,981
<i>We pray to thee
As night goes on</i>

2063
02:33:50,775 --> 02:33:54,810
<i>O shield us</i>

2064
02:33:54,852 --> 02:33:58,871
- They are singing.
- <i>With thy fatherly love</i>

2065
02:34:01,113 --> 02:34:09,712
<i>Securely sheltered
From all fear</i>

2066
02:34:10,621 --> 02:34:20,628
<i>Thy grace abounding
Let us rest</i>

2067
02:34:22,963 --> 02:34:25,174
He said something to Nero.

2068
02:34:25,340 --> 02:34:27,718
I could not hear the words.

2069
02:34:30,012 --> 02:34:33,223
Nero's looking at a man
that knows how to die.

2070
02:35:05,297 --> 02:35:06,882
Take him.

2071
02:35:14,598 --> 02:35:16,350
Commander?

2072
02:35:18,101 --> 02:35:20,187
They're not parting us.

2073
02:35:25,400 --> 02:35:27,236
Prepare her.

2074
02:35:40,707 --> 02:35:43,460
Here, my lord,
is our honored guest.

2075
02:35:43,627 --> 02:35:44,711
Vinicius?

2076
02:35:44,878 --> 02:35:48,303
- Why is he not in the arena?
- He will be, very much so.

2077
02:35:48,465 --> 02:35:49,800
In spirit.

2078
02:35:56,598 --> 02:35:58,475
It's a giant.

2079
02:36:01,144 --> 02:36:02,604
It's Hercules himself.

2080
02:36:02,771 --> 02:36:05,774
He has guarded
the Lygian girl from birth.

2081
02:36:05,941 --> 02:36:08,026
Now let us see him
guard her from death.

2082
02:36:08,193 --> 02:36:09,653
But what is the contest?

2083
02:36:31,341 --> 02:36:32,384
Look.

2084
02:36:32,551 --> 02:36:34,678
They've brought Marcus here
to face this.

2085
02:36:34,845 --> 02:36:36,388
By the...

2086
02:36:56,366 --> 02:36:58,785
Do not fret, Vinicius.

2087
02:36:58,952 --> 02:37:00,996
Remember,
I said I did not hate her.

2088
02:37:01,496 --> 02:37:03,206
I wish her no pain.

2089
02:37:03,373 --> 02:37:05,751
Lasting pain, that is.

2090
02:37:06,293 --> 02:37:08,545
I am devastated dear Petronius
is not here...

2091
02:37:08,712 --> 02:37:11,924
...to witness
our pleasure, Vinicius.

2092
02:37:12,090 --> 02:37:15,135
"Sing no more," he said.

2093
02:37:15,886 --> 02:37:19,264
<i>Upon these lilies I heap now</i>

2094
02:37:19,431 --> 02:37:23,226
<i>Red roses upon red</i>

2095
02:37:23,393 --> 02:37:26,647
<i>A blood-red tide shall surge</i>

2096
02:37:26,813 --> 02:37:32,450
<i>Upon her milk-white flesh</i>

2097
02:37:46,583 --> 02:37:49,211
Like your uncle,
you do have a certain amount of taste.

2098
02:37:49,378 --> 02:37:52,214
But I still think that
she's too narrow in the hips.

2099
02:37:52,381 --> 02:37:54,925
These people
know how to die, Nero.

2100
02:37:55,092 --> 02:37:57,010
In death,
you will squeal like a hog.

2101
02:37:57,594 --> 02:37:58,929
Give him the sword! Let him...

2102
02:37:59,096 --> 02:38:00,806
No, stay!

2103
02:38:01,098 --> 02:38:05,024
My lord, would you deprive him
of his final pleasure?

2104
02:38:23,954 --> 02:38:26,123
Superb, Poppaea. Magnificent.

2105
02:39:35,776 --> 02:39:37,194
A fair contest.

2106
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:39,821
Nero's justice is proverbial.

2107
02:39:56,421 --> 02:39:59,341
If the bull kills the giant,
so much for the girl.

2108
02:39:59,841 --> 02:40:03,599
But if our Hercules should be cruel enough
to destroy the poor animal...

2109
02:40:04,012 --> 02:40:07,919
...I shall have
to spare her life for Vinicius.

2110
02:40:08,391 --> 02:40:10,560
To breed more Christians.

2111
02:41:08,702 --> 02:41:09,953
Christ.

2112
02:41:10,120 --> 02:41:12,455
Christ, give him strength.

2113
02:41:48,074 --> 02:41:49,576
Seize him!

2114
02:42:01,838 --> 02:42:04,424
- Burner of Rome!
- Thumbs up!

2115
02:42:04,591 --> 02:42:06,343
- Burner of Rome!
- Thumbs up!

2116
02:42:27,697 --> 02:42:30,992
Ready up there?
First line, follow me.

2117
02:42:59,896 --> 02:43:02,065
Citizens of Rome.

2118
02:43:02,524 --> 02:43:04,401
I am Marcus Vinicius...

2119
02:43:04,567 --> 02:43:06,903
...commander of your 14th Legion.

2120
02:43:07,070 --> 02:43:09,030
This man who burned Rome...

2121
02:43:09,447 --> 02:43:11,741
...who killed innocents
for his own crime...

2122
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:14,619
...the rule of this madman is ended.

2123
02:43:14,786 --> 02:43:17,247
Rome is yours again.

2124
02:43:17,455 --> 02:43:20,834
Tonight, General Galba
marches from the north.

2125
02:43:21,001 --> 02:43:23,253
Your army has risen.

2126
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:25,422
Hail Galba!

2127
02:43:25,839 --> 02:43:28,675
<i>Galba, new emperor of Rome!</i>

2128
02:43:40,895 --> 02:43:42,105
A sword from Plautius.

2129
02:44:57,555 --> 02:45:00,266
Where are the Praetorian Guard?

2130
02:45:00,809 --> 02:45:03,353
Dead or in revolt.

2131
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:06,272
Dead, all dead.

2132
02:45:06,439 --> 02:45:10,583
My dear mother.
Octavia, the wife I loved.

2133
02:45:11,611 --> 02:45:15,365
My friend Petronius, all dead.

2134
02:45:15,532 --> 02:45:17,033
Dead.

2135
02:45:26,459 --> 02:45:28,545
You alone are left.

2136
02:45:30,213 --> 02:45:32,799
Kill the Christians, you said.

2137
02:45:33,341 --> 02:45:34,968
It was you.

2138
02:45:35,135 --> 02:45:37,971
It was you who turned my people...

2139
02:45:39,264 --> 02:45:40,890
...my faithful subjects...

2140
02:45:42,434 --> 02:45:44,602
...against me.

2141
02:45:53,486 --> 02:45:58,060
You are my evil genius.

2142
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:38,907
What are you doing here?

2143
02:46:39,073 --> 02:46:41,284
I banished you!
I didn't recall you!

2144
02:46:42,577 --> 02:46:44,742
I told you that
when you needed me...

2145
02:46:45,629 --> 02:46:46,897
...I would come to you.

2146
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:49,459
You defied me! Begone!

2147
02:46:59,260 --> 02:47:02,430
Acte, what will they do to me?

2148
02:47:02,597 --> 02:47:04,057
They will kill you.

2149
02:47:04,224 --> 02:47:06,142
They won't get in.

2150
02:47:43,304 --> 02:47:45,890
You've lived like a monster.

2151
02:47:46,266 --> 02:47:50,642
Now die like an emperor,
by your own hand.

2152
02:47:51,604 --> 02:47:53,273
I didn't wish to be a monster.

2153
02:47:53,731 --> 02:47:55,108
The gods willed it.

2154
02:47:55,275 --> 02:47:57,652
Now, or they will find you here.

2155
02:48:01,447 --> 02:48:05,615
Is this, then, the end of Nero?

2156
02:48:05,868 --> 02:48:07,036
Yes, my lord.

2157
02:48:07,203 --> 02:48:11,267
To be lord of the earth
and my own executioner.

2158
02:48:11,457 --> 02:48:13,376
Quickly.

2159
02:48:13,543 --> 02:48:17,300
Oh, how dull, how tasteless life
will be for them without me.

2160
02:48:17,797 --> 02:48:19,549
How can they face such a world?

2161
02:48:19,716 --> 02:48:21,426
How can they endure it?

2162
02:48:21,593 --> 02:48:23,761
Now, my lord.

2163
02:48:31,477 --> 02:48:33,688
Help me, Acte.

2164
02:49:00,798 --> 02:49:02,550
Hail Galba! Hail!

2165
02:49:02,717 --> 02:49:04,677
Hail Galba!

2166
02:49:04,844 --> 02:49:06,888
Hail Galba!

2167
02:49:07,055 --> 02:49:10,058
Hail Galba!

2168
02:49:13,728 --> 02:49:15,271
Hail Galba!

2169
02:49:15,438 --> 02:49:17,065
Hail!

2170
02:49:18,900 --> 02:49:21,277
Hail Galba!

2171
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:27,950
Galba has a task ahead of him.

2172
02:49:28,117 --> 02:49:30,878
Rebuild Rome
and bring back Roman justice.

2173
02:49:31,287 --> 02:49:35,458
I fear the glory that was Rome
will never fully be reached again, Marcus.

2174
02:49:36,501 --> 02:49:41,255
Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome.
What follows?

2175
02:49:41,839 --> 02:49:44,300
A more permanent world, I hope.

2176
02:49:44,676 --> 02:49:46,511
Or a more permanent faith.

2177
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:51,307
One is not possible
without the other.

2178
02:50:02,276 --> 02:50:04,153
What is it, commander?

2179
02:50:04,821 --> 02:50:08,074
It was right in this very spot
that Peter and I turned back to Rome.

2180
02:50:12,829 --> 02:50:15,498
It was here the Lord spoke to him.

2181
02:50:17,709 --> 02:50:20,169
It's a blessed spot.

2182
02:50:55,037 --> 02:51:01,080
<i>I am the Way,
the Truth and the Life.</i>
