1
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,840
''Keep my sister away from me

2
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,640
''Me and you, us never part''

3
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,680
Celie! Nettie!
Come back to the house now.

4
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,440
Girls, your mama got supper.

5
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,760
Celie, you got the ugliest smile
this side of Creation.

6
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,200
Ain't you done yet?

7
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
A girl!

8
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,800
l want it.

9
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,200
You better not tell nobody but God.

10
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,120
lt'd kill your mama.

11
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,720
Dear God...

12
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,120
...I'm fourteen years old.

13
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,160
I've always been a good girl.

14
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,680
Maybe you can give me a sign.

15
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,120
Let me know what's happening to me.

16
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,800
One day, my daddy come and say,
''You gonna do what your mama wouldn't. ''

17
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,440
Now, I got two children by my daddy.

18
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,720
A baby boy called Adam,
he took while I was sleeping...

19
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,960
...and a baby girl called Olivia...

20
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,760
...that he took right out of my arms.

21
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
Then my mama died...

22
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
...cursing and screaming...

23
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
...because her heart been broke.

24
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,080
Dear God, he act like
he can't stand me no more.

25
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,600
I don't think he kilt my baby boy.

26
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,680
I heard he sold it
to a preacher and his wife.

27
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,000
I keep hoping he'll find somebody to marry.

28
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,800
I seen him looking at my little sister.

29
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,320
She's scared.

30
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,160
But I say, ''I'll take care ofyou,
with God's help. ''

31
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,360
Dear God, he come home with a girl
from around the town called Gray.

32
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,000
She be almost my age,
but they getting married now.

33
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,960
My little sister, Nettie, has got
a man always looking at her.

34
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,760
His wife dead. She was killed by
her boyfriend, coming home from church.

35
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,000
He got three children.

36
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,160
He seen Nettie in church.

37
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,080
Now every Sunday evening,
here come Mister.

38
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,120
l want to marry your Nettie.

39
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,720
l got to have somebody right now.

40
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,040
l got nobody to watch over my young'uns.

41
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,840
They be fighting and bleeding
and throwing up on the floor...

42
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
...while l got a farm to run.

43
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,400
l'll take right good care of your Nettie.

44
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,080
l can't let you have Nettie.

45
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,840
She too young.

46
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,960
But l tell you what.
l can let you have Celie.

47
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,520
She oldest and should marry first.

48
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,200
She ain't fresh, but l expect you know that.

49
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,440
She's spoiled...twice.

50
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,120
Celie is ugly...

51
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,600
...but she works hard, and she can learn.

52
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,240
And God fixed her.

53
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,360
You can do what you like.
She won't make you feed or clothe it.

54
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,480
But Nettie, you flat out can't have.
Not now, not never.

55
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,560
Well, l ain't never looked
at the other one before.

56
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,120
Let me see her again.

57
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,000
Celie, Mister want another look at you.

58
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,440
Move up. He won't bite.

59
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
Turn around.

60
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,520
What you doing that for?

61
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,080
Your sister's thinking about marriage.

62
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,360
Why y'all standing out here waiting?

63
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,680
This here's your new mammy.

64
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,440
She ain't my mammy.

65
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,480
I don't cry.

66
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,440
I laid there thinking about Nettie,
while he on top of me.

67
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,000
Wonder if she's safe.

68
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,800
Then I think about
that pretty woman in the picture.

69
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,640
I know what he doing to me,
he done to her.

70
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,520
And maybe she like it.

71
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,960
Jesus!

72
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,960
Harpo, didn't l tell you to clean my saddle?

73
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,880
l did do it, Pa.

74
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,600
Look at the mold on the side.

75
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,440
Look at the dirt on it.
This don't look like it's clean.

76
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,120
The new mule, Joey, had it.
l couldn't get it from him.

77
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,120
He was biting and kicking on it.

78
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,680
When's the last time
their hair was combed?

79
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,800
Not since their mammy did it.

80
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,000
l'll have to shave it off.

81
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,200
No! lt's bad luck to cut a woman's hair.

82
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,280
This'll take all day.

83
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,840
Shut up!

84
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,240
l can't. lt hurts her.

85
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,360
Don't talk back to me.

86
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,320
You do what l tell you.

87
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,200
Dear God, I seen my baby girl.

88
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,440
I know it was her.

89
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,000
She lookedjust like me and my daddy.

90
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,720
Like more us than us is ourself.

91
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,040
My little girl looks like
she fretting over something.

92
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,280
She got my eyes,just like they is today.

93
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,800
Like everything I see, she's seeing.

94
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,720
That's real pretty.

95
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,920
l'm making me and my
little girl a new dress.

96
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,160
Her daddy will be so pleased.

97
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,920
Who her daddy?

98
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,360

99
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,240
Mr. Samuel...who he?

100
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,680

101
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,000

108
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,520
I think she mine.

109
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,600
My heart say she mine.

110
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,840
But I don't know she mine.

111
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,040
If she my baby, her name Olivia.

112
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,080
I stitch ''Olivia''
on all the seat of her diapers.

113
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,880
I stitch a lot of little flowers
and stars, too.

114
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,040
He took all the diapers when he took her.

115
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,400
What's her name?

116
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,280
Pauline.

117
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,440
But l calls her Olivia.

118
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,960
Whys you call her Olivia
when that ain't her name?

119
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,160
Don't she look like an Olivia to you?

120
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,360
Just look at those eyes.

121
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,560
Only somebody old would
have eyes like that.

122
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,640
So l call her Ole Livia.

123
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,400
Nice talking to you.

124
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,640
My husband's waiting.

125
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,280
You gonna buy anything or not, gal?

126
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,320
Give these to Mr. Johnson.

127
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,400

128
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
l just couldn't keep him off me.
Could l stay here with you?

129
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,680
Can Nettie stay with us for a spell?

130
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,400
Sure. She be kin now.

131
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,720
What happened with you and Pa?

132
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
l just couldn't keep him off me.

133
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,480
He'd try everything. You know how he is.

134
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,720
l ain't never going back there!

135
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,400
You hear what l say? l'd die first Celie.

136
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,120
Don't let them run over you.
Show them who's got the upper hand.

137
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,480
They got it.

138
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,960
You got to fight, Celie. You got to.

139
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,520
l don't know how to fight.

140
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,040
All l know how to do is stay alive.

141
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
You sure look pretty today, Nettie.

142
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,840
Celie, my boy be needing his supper.

143

''And you smell so good

''...before you can say, 'Amen.'''

155
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,760
You're gonna have to leave here soon...

156
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,600
...before he makes his move on you.

157
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,200
What would l do if l couldn't talk to you?

158
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,560
We could write.

159
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,360
-Can you read good?
-l can't say that l do.

160
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,760
l'll go to school for both of us.

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,000
Nice visiting.

301
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,400
You stay right here, Harpo.

302

At least somebody here know

Do you take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?

Forsaking all others for him alone...

...you will perform unto him
all duties owed a husband...

315
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,360

317
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,640
You may now salute the bride.

318
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,800
Amen!

319
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,520

320
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,040
l been needing so many curtains,
but l ain't had time.

321
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,440
You children go on home!

322
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,560
Harpo, come on down.

Busy making a racket.
Now come on down here!

325
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,640
Damn, l'll come down
when l'm good and ready!

326
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,880
Child, we're going to get you a little milk.

327
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,080
A little milk for the baby, yes, indeed.

328
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,160
Here. Go to your daddy.

329
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,160
What should l do with it?

330
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,720
Feed her, then fix up the mess you done.

331
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,760
l can smell the rain coming.

332
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,480
Miss Celie, we got ourselves some new
curtains l want to put in the bedroom.

333
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,160
What you looking at?

334
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,320
lt's gonna rain on your head!

335
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,720
You ever hit her?

336
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,600
No, sir.

337
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,800
How do you expect her to mind?

338
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,360
Wives is like children.

339
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,240
You have to let them know
who got the upper hand.

340
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,240
Nothing can do it better
than a good beating.

341
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,400
Sofia thinks too much of herself.

342
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,080
Needs to be taken down a peg or two.

343
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,280
Got a new baby and it cry all night long.

344
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,320
Kept him up so he said
he wasn't going to work.

345
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,680
She got all upset but l said,
leave the man alone.

346
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,320
Sometimes a man just needs
to be left alone.

347
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,760
l want some food!

348
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,120
Pie's in the pantry. Women need
to be left alone sometimes, too.

349
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,240
l tell Harpo, when l'm fussing,
''leave me alone! ''

350
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,800
Get it for me!

351
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,760
What's the matter with you?

352
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,160
That's my own baby crying.

353
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,200
Make yourself useful.

354
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,240
What should l do about Sofia?

355
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,120
Beat her.

356
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,800
You told Harpo to beat me!

357
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,400
lt was that mule, Old Joey.
Old Joey, the mule.

358
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,080
l was plowing the north field
and the mule went crazy.

359
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,760
He started kicking.
Busted my eye and my lip.

360
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,640
All my life l had to fight.

361
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,480
l had to fight my daddy,
l had to fight my uncles.

362
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,720
l had to fight my brothers.

363
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,080
Girl child ain't safe in a family of mens.

364
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,440
But l never thought l had
to fight in my own house!

365
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,600
l loves Harpo.

366
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,160
God knows l do.

367
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,480
But l'll kill him dead
before l let him beat me!

368
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,560
That's a hoof print.

369
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,240
lt's a fist print.

370
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,040
No, sir. Ain't no fist touched my face.

371
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,080
You want a dead son-in-law, Miss Celie?

372
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,120
You keep on advising him like you're doing.

373
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,400
This life be over soon.
Heaven lasts always.

374
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,560
You should bash Mister's head open
and think about Heaven later.

375
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,120
Sofia beat on Harpo.

376
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,680
Then Harpo beat on Sofia.

377
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,560
And then, Sofia beat on Harpo some more.

378
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,080
In between the beatings,
the children keep coming.

379
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,000
And then one day,
Sofia can't take it no more.

380
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,120
Good riddance!

381
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,960
Nettie.

382
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,360
l brung you some fresh-baked cookies,
made in my stove!

383
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,480
Have a fine day, Mr. Huntley!
And keep the plate!

384
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,520
Anything come for me?

385
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,880
Dear God, today was a peculiar day.

386
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,200
I was sitting on the porch
reading to the kids...

387
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,240
...when suddenly, something struck me.

388
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,120
I got up and looked at the sky.

389
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,000
It was dark and there
wasn't nothing moving.

390
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,240
I got down off the porch...

391
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,920
...to see what was coming.
It felt like twister weather.

392
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,080
I didn't see nothing.
But I know something's there.

393
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,400
Yes, indeed, Lord.
I know something's coming.

394
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,280
Who that, Pa? Who this?

395
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,200
Pa, who this?

396
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,480
The woman that should have been
your mammy.

397
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,680
Shug Avery?

398
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,680
Give me a hand and get her in the house.

399
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,240
Celie! Help me get her in the house.

400
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,800
Celie! Get here!

401
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,400
This Shug Avery, a friend of the family.
Fix up the spare room.

402
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,000
I can't move.

403
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,360
I can't move! I need to see her eyes.

404
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,040
I feel that once I see her eyes,
my feet can let go...

405
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,080
...of where they're stuck.

406
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,000
You sure is ugly!

407
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,440
Turn loose my goddamn hand!

408
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,480
What's the matter with you? You crazy?

409
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,840
l don't need no weak little boy...

410
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,360
...can't say no to his daddy, hanging on me!

411
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,560
l need me a man! You hear!

412
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,120
A man!

413
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,480
And l don't want to smell
no goddamn stinking pipe, Albert!

414
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,000
Get that thing to make me
something to eat.

415
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,720
No, l'll make it myself.

416
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,760
Albert?

417
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,040
Shit!

418
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,880
Eggs. Skillet. Why are the pots up here?

419
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,680
Nobody can get to them.

420
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,480
Butter, butter, butter.

421
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,040
lt's in the cooler, on the shelf.

422
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,680
Butter? Butter!

423
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,400
ln the cooler, on the shelf.

424
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,920
Albert.

425
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,000
How do you work this stove?

426
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,040
Ain't hot enough.

427
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,800
Can't even keep a stove
burning good all day.

428
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,320
She can't even keep her oven hot!

429
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,640
You're useless sometimes!

430
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,040
Wood. Wood.

431
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,240
Did you ever cook on this?

432
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,960
lt still ain't hot enough!

433
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,480
l'll get it hot.
l'll show you how to make it...hot.

434
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,440
Baby, look what l brought you.

435
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,480
Have l got a surprise for you.
This'll make you all well.

436
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,040
This looks burnt, but the eggs
are the way you like them.

437
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,400
Are you trying to kill me?

438
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,120
Now, baby, don't be that way!

439
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,800
l told you, l don't want nothing!

440
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Ijust stand back, and wait to see
what the wall will look like.

441
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,520
See what kind of colors
Shug'll put on there now.

442
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,960
What you staring at?
Never seen a naked woman before?

443
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,520
You got any children?

444
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,160
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,520
''Yes, ma'am''? l ain't that old.

446
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,920
Two.

447
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,840
Where they at?

448
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,920
l don't know.

449
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,640
Who are you?

450
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,360
Celie, ma'am.

451
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,720
You ain't well.

452
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,040
Mind your own business. l feel fine.
Just had to eat.

453
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,240
Now, put some more bubbling oil
in this tub.

454
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,920
You got kids?

455
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,840
Yeah.

456
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,840
They with my ma and pa.

457
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,840
Never knowed a child to come out right
unless there's a man around.

458
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,920
Children...

459
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,640
...got to have a pa.

460
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,920
Your pa love you?

461
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,560
My pa loved me.

462
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,600
My pa still loves me...

463
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,680
...except he don't know it.

464
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,120
He don't know it.

465
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,440
Hey, boy! Here, boy!

466
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,720
Nobody here to greet your pa?

467
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,000
Sure ain't nobody in the fields.

468
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,720
Just couldn't rest till you got her
in your house, could you?

469
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,880
Cool drink?

470
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,440
Take your hat?

471
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,240
What is it with this Shug Avery?

472
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,120
She black as tar...

473
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,040
...nappy-headed....

474
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,040
She got legs like baseball bats.

475
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,720
Her own daddy won't have
nothing to do with her.

476
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,760
Old Mister talking trash about Shug.

477
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,880
Folks don't like nobody
being too proud or too free.

478
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,000
She's no more than a jook-joint Jezebel.

479
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,200
She ain't even clean.

480
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,360
l hear she's got
that nasty women's disease.

481
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,680
You ain't got it in you to understand.

482
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,400
l love Shug Avery.

483
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,120
Always have, always will.

484
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,160
Should've married her when l had a chance.

485
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,920
And throwed your life away. And a right
smart amount of my money with it.

486
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,000
l hear all her children's
got different daddies.

487
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,120
lt's all too trifling and confused.

488
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,440
All Shug's children got the same daddy.
l can vouch--

489
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,360
You can vouch for nothing!

490
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,120
Shug Avery done set the population
of Hartwell County a new high.

491
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,080
You just one of the roosters, boy.

492
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,480
You has my sympathy.

493
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,400
Ain't many women's allow their
husband's whore to lay up in their house.

494
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,360
Hand Pa his hat.

495
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,920
Next time, I'll put a little Shug Avery pee
in his glass...

496
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,000
...and see how he like that.

497
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,000
I ain't heard so much racket
since before Sofia left.

498
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,800
Every evening after he leave the field...

499
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,480
...he knocking down and piling things up.

500
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,280
Sometime his friend, Swain,
come by to help.

501
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,960
Harpo!

502
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,560
Two of them worked long way past supper.

503
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,240
Mister have to call and tell them
to shut up the racket.

504
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,400
What you doing?

505
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,280
Building a jook joint!

506
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,920
Way back here?

507
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,520
Jook joint's supposed to
be way back in the woods.

508
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,680
You never seen this before.

509
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,440
l know what a cow looks like.

510
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,760
You ain't never seen a cow like this.

511
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,960
Ready...one...two...three!

512
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,520
Welcome to Harpo's! l'm Harpo.

513
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,680
Girl, l'd drink your bath water!

514
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,000
Oh, sugar dumpling, let me taste some!

515
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,280
You can catch a fish without a hook, girl.

516
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,880
Looks like Albert brought his maid.

517
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,040
Last time l saw that kind of hat
was at my mama's funeral.

518
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,720
There are only two kinds of children
in this world...

519
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,120
...God's children and Satan's!

520
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,000
Babylon ain't no far-off place in the desert.

521
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,640
lt's right here! Just a few
hundred yards from this holy place.

522
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,200
The song l'm about to sing...

523
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,040
...is called ''Miss Celie's Blues.''

524
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,520
Because she scratched it out
of my head when l was ailing.

525
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,760
''Sister

526
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,840
''You've been on my mind

527
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,360
''Oh, Sister

l used to live here.

553
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,960
This used to be my living room.
That was my kitchen.

554
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,920
Harpo run the doors and
windows from the creek to here.

01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,560
This is scandalous!
A woman with children in a jook joint!

567
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,760
A woman need to have a little fun, Harpo.

A woman need to be at home.

569

l don't fight my woman's battles.

570
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,560
My job is to love her and take her
where she want to go. Right?

571
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,320
Let's dance.

572
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,040
First time l ever been knocked out
without a punch.

573
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,200
Be nice now.

574
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,040

Fine with me.

579
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,360
You ain't going nowhere.
This is my jook joint.

580
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,280
You said it's our jook joint!

581
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,760
Can't a man dance with his wife?

582
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,840
Not if she left him.

583
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,440
Good night.

584
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,080

01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,400
Time to go.

587
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,440
Oh, shit!

588
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,840
This is my place!

589
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,720

01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,680
What about me?

591
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,000
Come on, l don't want to come in after you.

592
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,920
Lord have mercy! Firemen ain't
gonna get it, somebody call the law!

593
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,400
You can light a fire without a match.

594
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:45,320
You can catch a fish without a hook.
You can make a blind man see.

595
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,920
Now do your shimmy.

596
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,480
Shake your shimmy, girl!
Come on! Show me your stuff!

597
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,760
Miss Celie, why you always
covering up your smile?

598
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,440
Show me some teeth.

599
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,000
Show me that pretty smile.

600
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,800
Oh, girl, you need...

601
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,040
...a smiling lesson.

602
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,880
''Made him stout. Wasn't satisfied
till he made him a snout.

603
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,440
''Made him a snout as long as a rail.

604
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,760
''Wasn't satisfied till he made him a tail.
Made him a tail....''

605
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,160
You see, Miss Celie,

606
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,560

September. Yeah, September be a
good time to go off in the world.

608
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,640
What's the matter?

609
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,560
He beat me when you ain't here.

610
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,320
Who do?

611
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,160
Albert?

612
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,880
Mister.

613
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,840
Why he do that?

614
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,920
He beat me for not being you.

615
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,160

You still love him?

l got what you call a passion for him.

619
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,920
lf l was ever going to have a husband,
he'd been it. But he weak.

620
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,000
Tell me the truth.

621
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,880
Do you mind if Albert sleep with me?

622
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,960
You like sleeping with him?

623
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:38,040
l have to confess, l love it. Don't you?

624
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,760
No, most time l pretend l ain't even there.

625
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,960
He don't know the difference.

626
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,720
He don't never ask me how l feel.

627
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,120
He never ask me about myself.

628
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,160
He just climb on top of me
and do his business.

629
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,720
''Do his business''?

630
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,640
You sound like...

631
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,840
...he going to the toilet on you.

632
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,560
That's what it feel like.

637
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,200

Oh, Miss Celie, that was just

The way you'd make your voice
rise and fall when you turned a phrase.

657
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:58,060
The way you looked in your blue suit.
Girls cutting their eyes at you.

658
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:59,820
Something to see.

659
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,740
You'd smile at us and say:

660
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,300
''Ladies...

661
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:11,460

01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:15,100
Don't touch me! Leave me alone!
Don't touch me!

706
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,500
Who do you think you are! You fat nigger!

707
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:27,100
God, dear God! Sheriff, help me!

708
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,820
Howdy, Mayor.

709
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,260
How are you?

710
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,540
Fine.

711
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:59,740
-How's the missus?
-She's doing real well.

712
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:03,940
Let's see what we have here.

713
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,420
l'm driving!

714
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:17,900
l'm driving.

715
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,420
Look, l'm driving!

716
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,500
lsn't that fun!

717
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,500
Dear God...

718
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,500
...after many years,
they let Sofia out ofjail...

719
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,620
...just to put her in the next.

720
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:47,100
She ended up being
Miss Millie's maid after all.

721
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:52,260
Mayor bought Miss Millie a car,
and she had Sofia teach her how to drive.

722
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:55,460
Poor Sofia, stuck with Miss Millie...

723
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,580
...for the rest of her life.

724
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:59,300
We went past the store.

725
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,980
l've got it. Top of the 'H'. Here we go.

726
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,540
That was exciting, wasn't it?

727
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:17,060
Yes, ma'am, l reckon it was.

728
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,860
Let's do the shopping!

729
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:26,380
l need apples, raisins,
cinnamon, currants, lemons...

730
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,380
...crackers, sugar, oranges,
nutmeg, flour, salt, pepper...

731
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,700
...cloves, eggs, and some candy
for the children.

732
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:48,700
l've been wondering about us starting
a fund for the poor colored children....

733
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,020
Sofia's been teaching me how to drive.

734
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:07,540
Have you ever thought
about going to Mars?

735
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:09,580
l wonder what it's like.

736
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:12,820
They call it the red planet.
Does it look red?

737
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:27,700
How do, Mr. Peters?
Look at me, l'm driving.

738
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,580
Sofia, l'm gonna drive you home tomorrow.

739
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:48,660
Did you hear what l said?
l'm gonna drive you home.

740
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,100
Home?

741
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,860
Yes, home.

742
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:55,740
You haven't seen your children in a while.

743
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:02,060
No, l ain't seen them in about eight years.

744
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,460
That's a shame.

745
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:11,100
Tomorrow's Christmas!
You can stay all day!

746
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,780
You can stay all day!

747
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:20,500
l will drive myself back.

748
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,660
Thank you.

749
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,780
That's your mama.

750
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:13,940
That's her.

751
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:21,620
Go on.

752
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,300
Hi, my name is Emma.

753
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,460
l'm very pleased to meet you.

754
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:30,100
l'll pick you up at 5:00.

755
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:00,860
Oh, Miss Sofia, it's so good
to have you home.

756
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:34,980
Why're you crying?

757
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:39,460
'Cause l don't know y'all no more.

758
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:00,780
l can do it. l can put this thing in reverse.

759
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,020
l can make it go the right way.

760
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,300
She can't get it out of reverse.

761
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:48,460
You get away from me! Don't touch me!

762
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,620
Don't you know who l am?

763
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:55,020
l've always been good to you people!

764
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:57,460
Calm down.

765
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:00,140
l am Miss Millie! l'm the mayor's wife!

766
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,620
l've always been good to you people!

767
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,380
l've always gone
out of my way for coloreds!

768
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:09,140
Miss Millie, what's the matter?

769
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:12,300
Those boys...

770
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:14,700
...tried to attack me.

771
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:16,780
No such a thing.

772
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:21,980
How could you leave me alone for so long?

773
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:28,940
What am l gonna do about the car?

774
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:34,220
Jack will drive you home, Miss Millie.

775
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:40,260
l can't ride in a car with
some strange colored man.

776
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:46,740
l'll ask my sister Odessa to squeeze in.

777
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,820
That way l have more time
with my children.

778
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:58,740
l don't know her either.

779
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,420

01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,180

This here's my wedding present.

791
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:51,300
l want Albert to learn how to drive it.

792

You had her your way. l had her mine.

But we had her!

l'll get my mail. l'm expecting
an agreement from Memphis.

800
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:46,380
You ought to wait for Mister.

801
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:49,660
lf l was to wait for Albert,
l'd wait till Christmas.

Well, let's toast it at somebody.

Trees and trees and more trees
on top of that.

they look like they were built.

879
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:33,500
And vines and ferns
and animals and noises...

880
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:37,500
...that make you wonder
what is lurking behind the shadows...

881
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:39,420
...of every bush.

882
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:47,500
We're up at 5:00...

883
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:51,700
...for a breakfast of millet,
porridge and fruit, then morning classes.

884
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:55,100
We teach the children English,
reading, writing...

885
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:59,260
...history, geography,
arithmetic and Bible stories.

886
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:07,620
The older children are
used to going to mission school.

887
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,340
The smaller ones are not.

888
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:13,500
Their mothers drag them here
screaming and kicking.

889
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:17,340
They're all boys. Olivia's the only girl.

890
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:31,300
There is a little African girl called Tashi.

891
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:33,500
She plays with Olivia.

892
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:36,420
''Why can't Tashi come to school?''
She asked me.

893
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:40,260
I told her the Olinka don't believe
in educating girls.

894
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:42,420
She said, quick as a flash:

895
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:46,300
''Like white people at home
who don't want black people to learn. ''

896
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:49,060
She is sharp, Celie.

897
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:52,380
When Tashi can get away
from her chores...

898
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,140
...she and Olivia hide in my hut.

899
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:58,660
To Olivia right now, Tashi alone is Africa....

900
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:03,580
Everything she learns, she shares
with Tashi. Sound familiar?

901
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:22,980
At first, there was the faintest
sound of movement in the forest.

902
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:27,900
A kind of low humming.
Then chopping and the sound of dragging.

903
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:30,980
Then the scent. Some days there's smoke.

904
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:34,340
Now, after two months
during which I or the children...

905
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:36,380
...or Corrine has been sick...

906
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:39,700
...all we hear is chopping
and scraping and dragging.

907
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:42,300
Every day we smell smoke.

908
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:46,820
Today a boy in my afternoon
class burst out as he entered:

909
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,380
''The road approaches!''

910
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:01,420
Dear Celie, the white man
is building a road.

911
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:04,500
It reached the cassava
fields nine months ago.

912
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:09,260
The morning after the road was done,
as far as Olinka was concerned...

913
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:13,100
...what should we discover,
but that the road builders were back.

914
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:18,220
They have instructions to continue
the road for another 30 miles...

915
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:23,180
...and continue it right
through the village of Olinka.

916
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:40,300
The road builders didn't deviate
an inch from the head man's plan.

917
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:43,020
Every hut that lay in the road's path...

918
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:44,740
...was leveled.

919
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:48,300
Celie, our church, our school...

920
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:50,660
...my hut...

921
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:53,260
...all went down in a matter of hours.

922
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:05,380
But the worst is yet to be told.

923
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:10,020
Sweet Corrine...died from fever and grief.

924
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:14,340
We buried her in the Olinka way.

925
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:19,940
But Celie, my dear sweet sister...

926
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:25,060
...we'll all be coming home once we work
something out with U.S. Immigration.

927
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:28,940
They don't know if we're American,
African, or missionary.

928
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:31,340
Just pray for us, Celie.

929
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:34,220
Watch for me in the sunset.

930
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:42,060
What's with you?
l was calling you for an hour!

931
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:44,980
Now get my shave
and don't keep me waiting!

932
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:51,820
-Where's Celie?
-Home fixing to shave Mister.

933
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:23,060
You got a fever? l didn't come here
for you to take all day to shave me.

934
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:26,380
Get the molasses out of your ass!

935
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:03,940
The longer l'm married to you,
the slower and dumber you get.

936
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:08,180
Your ass as slow as l ever seen it before.

937
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:37,660
Celie! Ain't that razor sharpened yet?

938
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:41,500
Get out here and do me right now!
Get out here!

939
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:48,100
All right.

940
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:30,620
Put your head back.

941
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:47,900
Cut my neck and l'll get you by the ears.

942
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:04,060
That razor looks dull to me, Miss Celie.

943
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:14,900
Damn women.

944
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:38,980
How you feeling, Miss Sofia?

945
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:41,220
Confused.

946
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:43,460
Ain't you glad to be home?

947
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:46,300
Maybe.

948
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:58,780
-Now come the time for me to tell you.
-What?

949
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:02,980
lt's time for us to go.

950
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:06,980
You're such good people. Salt of the earth.

951
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:08,860
lt's time to move on.

952
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:10,980
-Celie is coming with us.
-What?

953
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:15,420
Celie is coming to Memphis with us.

954
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:17,700
Over my dead body!

955
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:20,420
You satisfied? That's what you want?

956
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:23,140
Now what's wrong with you?

957
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,980
You a lowdown, dirty dog,
that's what's wrong.

958
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:30,980
lt's time for me to get away from you...

959
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:32,740
...and enter Creation.

960
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:35,460
Your dead body be
the welcome mat l need.

961
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:38,340
You can't talk to my boy that way.

962
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:39,860
Your boy.

963
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:43,900
lf he hadn't been your boy
he might have been a halfway decent man.

964
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:45,580
Say what?

965
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:48,260
You took my sister Nettie away from me.

966
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:54,340
You knew she was the only person
in the world who loved me.

967
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:01,540
But Nettie and my kids
are coming home soon.

968
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:05,860
And when we get together,
we're going to whip your ass.

969
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:12,100
Nettie and your kids?
Woman, you talking crazy.

970
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:16,860
l got children.
My children are living in Africa.

971
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:21,580
Africa! Learning different languages.

972
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:24,620
Fresh air, plenty of exercise.

973
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:29,380
They'll turn out better
than these fools you never tried to raise.

974
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:32,140
-Hold on here!
-No ''hold on'', Harpo.

975
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:37,100
lf you hadn't tried to rule over Sofia,
white folks wouldn't have got her.

976
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:39,820
-That's a lie!
-And a little truth in it.

977
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:46,180
Y'all was rotten kids.
You was. You was rotten kids!

978
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:51,340
Made my life here hell.

979
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:55,980
Your daddy ain't nothing
but some dead horseshit.

980
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,300
Shut up!

981
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:04,900
lt's bad luck for a woman
to laugh at a man!

982
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:26,060
My God, the dead has arisen.

983
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:34,060
l had enough bad luck to keep me
laughing the rest of my life.

984
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:40,300
Sitting in that jail,
l near about done rot to death.

985
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:44,940
l know what it like, Miss Celie.

986
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:47,540
Want to go somewhere and can't.

987
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:53,900
l know what it like to want to
sing and have it beat out of you.

988
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:57,740
l want to thank you, Miss Celie...

989
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:00,820
...for everything you done for me.

990
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:05,580
l remember the day
l was in the store with Miss Millie.

991
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:10,860
l was feeling real down.
l was feeling mighty bad.

992
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:14,380
And when l see'd you...

993
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,900
...l knowed there is a god.

994
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:23,660
l knowed there is a god, and one day
l was going to get to come home.

995
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:27,940
You won't get a penny of my money.
Not one thin dime!

996
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:31,220
Did l ever ask you for anything?

997
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:34,100
Not even for your sorry-ass hand
in marriage!

998
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:36,340
l never asked you for nothing!

999
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:42,100
Old Sofia home now. Sofia home.

1000
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,740
Things are going to change around here.

1001
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:46,420
l'm going with Shug.

1002
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:48,820
You going where?

1003
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:50,860
With Miss Celie and Shug.

1004
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:53,180
l'm fixing to sing.

1005
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:56,940
Too much racket going on in this house.
Pass me the peas.

1006
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:58,660
Listen, Squeak--

1007
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:00,900
-My name ain't Squeak.
-What?

1008
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:04,580
My name is Mary Agnes.

1009
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:05,860
Mary what?

1010
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,740
Mary Agnes.

1011
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:09,700
l thought it was Squeak.

1012
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:13,940
Who cares?
Boy, you going to let this nappy-head gal...

1013
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:17,460
...cuss you out?
You're at the head of your own table...

1014
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:19,180
...and you acting like a waiter!

1015
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:23,420
Hush, you old fool!
Always meddling in somebody's business.

1016
01:58:25,660 --> 01:58:29,660
She'll be back. Shug got talent.
She can sing.

1017
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:35,260
She got spunk and can talk to anybody.
She can stand up and be noticed.

1018
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:36,900
What you got?

1019
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:40,380
You're ugly. You're skinny.
You're shaped funny.

1020
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:43,180
You're too scared to open
your mouth to people.

1021
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:45,980
All you fit to do is be Shug's maid.

1022
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:47,340
Albert, no.

1023
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:52,180
Take out her slop jar, maybe cook her food.
You ain't even that good a cook.

1024
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:55,740
She's a lot better
than that first wife of yours.

1025
01:58:56,020 --> 01:58:59,180
This house ain't been cleaned good
since my first wife died.

1026
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:01,500
Nobody's crazy enough to marry you.

1027
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:05,180
So what will you do?
Hire yourself to farm?

1028
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:08,500
Maybe someone will let you work
on their railroad.

1029
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,740
Maybe sweep out the caboose.

1030
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:17,020
Any more letters come?

1031
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:21,940
Could be. Could be not. Who's to say?

1032
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:28,220
l curse you! Until you do right by me...

1033
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:30,420
...everything you think about...

1034
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:31,700
...will crumble!

1035
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:33,020
Don't do it.

1036
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:37,020
Don't trade places
with what l been through.

1037
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:42,980
Come on, Miss Celie. Let's go into the car.

1038
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:45,060
He ain't worth it.

1039
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:46,980
He ain't worth it.

1040
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,740
Who you think you is?

1041
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:53,500
You can't curse nobody. Look at you!

1042
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:58,460
You're black, you're poor, you're ugly,
you're a woman! You're nothing!

1043
01:59:58,940 --> 02:00:03,620
Until you do right by me,
everything you even think about will fail!

1044
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:10,140
lt's been a pleasure meeting all of you.
Good-bye.

1045
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:12,540
l came back just in time.

1046
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:15,820
We need some stability around here,
that's for sure.

1047
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:18,420
l should have locked you up!

1048
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:20,180
Just let you out to work!

1049
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:23,300
The jail you planned for me
is the one you'll rot in.

1050
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:25,380
Celie, get in the car.

1051
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:35,620
Everything you done to me...

1052
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:39,580
...is already done to you.

1053
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:56,580
l'm poor...black.

1054
02:00:57,860 --> 02:00:59,940
l may even be ugly.

1055
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,820
But dear God, l'm here!

1056
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:05,020
l'm here!

1057
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:09,420
But you'll be back!

1058
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:13,060
What are you going to do? You'll be back!

1059
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:30,540
Boy, what's the matter with you?

1060
02:04:32,980 --> 02:04:35,380
This house is a wreck!

1061
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:37,980
Been drinking.

1062
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:40,460
You want some supper?

1063
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:47,020
l hear you been spending more time
at Harpo's and less in the fields.

1064
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:52,620
l guess l just raised you wrong.

1065
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:54,540
How's that, Pa?

1066
02:04:56,980 --> 02:05:00,980
The fields overgrown,
the animals ain't tended to...

1067
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:03,220
...this house is a wreck.

1068
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:06,540
And what you doing about it? Nothing.

1069
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:10,540
Just sitting here drinking, ruining your life.

1070
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:12,940
My life's already ruined.

1071
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:16,780
This house is dead.
There's no Shug, no children...

1072
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:19,980
...no laughter and no life. Just me.

1073
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:23,860
l ain't heard such nonsense in all my life.

1074
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:28,180
Now listen to me.
l know just what you need.

1075
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:32,500
We need you a woman.

1076
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:36,820
Nice little girl clean the house,
iron your shirts--

1077
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:38,020
'Bye, Pa.

1078
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:43,260
You listen to what l say.

1079
02:05:46,580 --> 02:05:50,260
Get yourself a young girl.
Heed your daddy's advice.

1080
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:52,700
Get these chickens in the coop...

1081
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:55,740
...before they lay eggs all over the place.

1082
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:04,340
lt's time to go now. Time to go home.

1083
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:06,340
You know l don't want to dance.

1084
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:08,740
l move good for an old man.

1085
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:12,260
Come on, time to go. Time to go now.
Come on!

1086
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:17,260
l got some Tennessee tobacco
...cured with whiskey.

1087
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:19,740
You know l don't smoke.

1088
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:22,740
Time to go!

1089
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:24,980
That's right. Time to go now.

1090
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:27,420
Time to go.

1091
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:50,580
Time to go.

1092
02:06:58,780 --> 02:07:00,380
Time to go!

1093
02:07:05,980 --> 02:07:07,900
lt sure is nice...

1094
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:14,780
...to see you two together again.

1095
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:32,860
Maybe you should see him home.

1096
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:34,620
He'll be just fine.

1097
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:39,100
Just fine.

1098
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:13,060
Dear God, after all these years...

1099
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:16,380
...the man I knew as my pa is dead.

1100
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:23,940
But then, Nettie write
that my real daddy lynched.

1101
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:28,860
My mama marry this dead man
two years after my real daddy dead.

1102
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:32,380
My children, not my sister and brother.

1103
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:35,140
Pa, not Pa.

1104
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:38,340
You his wife?

1105
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:40,900
Yes, ma'am.

1106
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:44,100
How'd he die?

1107
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:51,300
On top of me.

1108
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:11,980
lt's all yours now.

1109
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:16,900
Yeah, but l still don't understand how.

1110
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:21,900
Your real daddy owned this land
and the house and the store.

1111
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:24,100
He left it to your mama.

1112
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:28,420
When your mama died,
it passed on to you and your sister Nettie.

1113
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:30,980
He left me the money, though.

1114
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:35,900
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we got a train to catch.

1115
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:16,300
l never figured l'd wear pants.
Not of all the things Miss Celie made.

1116
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:18,060
What do you think?

1117
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:21,420
Sofia, Sofia. That sure is a pretty name.

1118
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:26,220
How can a pair of pants
that fits Sofia fit me?

1119
02:10:26,700 --> 02:10:29,420
You're just going to have to try them on.

1120
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:31,820
lt's just like my sign say:

1121
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:34,540
''One size fits all.''

1122
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:37,300
Try them on and you'll see.

1123
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:38,900
Sure enough?

1124
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:41,620
Close that curtain.

1125
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:44,780
l don't want you showing Emma
all your business.

1126
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:46,940
He hasn't changed a lick.

1127
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:51,540
l got this fabric from Washington.
l wanted to make you a pair of pants.

1128
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:04,620
Miss Celie, you is a miracle!

1129
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:07,500
Where will you wear them britches?

1130
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:08,860
Nowhere.

1131
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:21,300
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

1132
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:24,140
Me and Shug, I smile.

1133
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:26,660
But us still longing.

1134
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:29,220
More than anything, God love admiration.

1135
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:30,780
You saying God is vain?

1136
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:35,020
No, not vain.
Just wanting to share a good thing.

1137
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:40,300
l think it pisses God off
if you walk by the color purple...

1138
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:42,100
...in a field...

1139
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:44,100
...and you don't notice it.

1140
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:50,380
Are you saying it just want to be loved
like it say in the Bible?

1141
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:54,420
Yeah, Celie. Everything want to be loved.

1142
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:58,260
Us sing and dance and holler...

1143
02:11:59,380 --> 02:12:01,780
...just trying to be loved.

1144
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:05,140
Look at them trees.

1145
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:09,780
Ever notice how trees do everything
to get attention that we do...

1146
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:11,580
...except walk.

1147
02:12:15,580 --> 02:12:19,140
Oh, Miss Celie, l feels like singing!

1148
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:35,100
''Sister

1149
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:37,820

1152
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:44,820
''So, Sister

1153
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:48,500
''I'm keeping my eye on you

1154
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:54,060
''I bet you think I don't know nothing''

1155
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:57,660
All of us been prodigal children
one time or another!

1156
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:01,940
And it's possible for the Lord
to drive you home.

1157
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:04,860
And He can drive you home to Truth.

1158
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:08,540
He can fix it for you if you trust Him.

1159
02:13:09,460 --> 02:13:12,220
Let's sing ''God ls Trying
To Tell You Something.''

1160
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:14,820
Sing ''God ls Trying
To Tell You Something.''

1161
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:28,500
''So let me tell you something''
