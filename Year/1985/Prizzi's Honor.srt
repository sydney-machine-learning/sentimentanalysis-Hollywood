1
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:48,685
Angelo!
My oldest, dearest friend.

2
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:50,555
Your son!

3
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:54,173
He lost his mother,
but he's got another father.

4
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:56,894
I'm his father now, with you.

5
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,360
I'll be as one with you,
protecting his future.

6
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:08,771
We're honoured,
Don Padrone.

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,871
Raise the first finger
of your right hand.

8
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:38,749
This drop of blood symbolizes
your birth into our family.

9
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:43,733
We're one,
until death.

10
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:46,475
We'll protect you...

11
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:50,634
so much you protect
Prizzi's honour.

12
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:55,182
- Do you swear it?
- Yeah.

13
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:03,452
Now that you have sealed a truly
Christian marriage...

14
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:06,795
give these wedding rings to each
other saying after me:

15
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:11,918
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

16
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,859
take and wear this ring...

17
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:17,434
as a sign of my love...

18
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:19,509
and fidelity.

19
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:26,013
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

20
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:28,935
take and wear this ring...

21
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:31,104
as a sign of my love...

22
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,981
and fidelity.

23
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:37,152
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

24
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:43,186
Hey, you know that girl up there...

25
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,601
blonde, lavender gloves?

26
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:49,747
Look pal
I'd like to help you but...

27
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,751
I gotta take shots of the notables,
the bishops...

28
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:54,801
Mr. Partanna,
what can I do for you?

29
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:58,055
I want shots of that girl up there
in the lavender gloves.

30
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,820
You got it,
my pleasure.

31
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,831
Take care of yourselves.

32
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,540
Don't tell me that
was Charley Partanna.

33
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:11,606
- Himself.
- Holy shit.

34
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:33,772
Hey, give me a ride over
to the reception, will ya'?

35
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:37,267
There's over half a dozen veal
steaks on the Prizzi meat counter.

36
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:40,633
You got it Charley, jump in.

37
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:21,876
Ok, quiet down!
Quiet down!

38
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,260
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother Eduardo and I...

39
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:31,549
would like to introduce you to a man
who needs no introduction:

40
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:34,354
Our father
your dear friend...

41
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:37,566
a legend to his people:

42
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:40,777
Don Corrado Prizzi.

43
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:58,753
My father welcomes all of you
to this great family occasion...

44
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,965
and he says that you should
all have a great time.

45
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:03,234
He offers his toast of love...

46
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,594
to the happiness of the bride
and groom...

47
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:08,875
and he wishes them
many children.

48
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,977
Thanks to you all.

49
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:06,322
Excuse me would you care
to dance?

50
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:08,831
Yes.

51
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,022
Some spread, huh?

52
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:42,317
Haven't I seen you
before?

53
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:44,987
I'm sure I'd remember.

54
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,074
I mean...

55
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:50,815
maybe's you were at the marry
mountain with the bride...

56
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:53,829
I could never miss you.

57
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:55,695
And you are?

58
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,584
Charley Partanna,
pleased to meet you.

59
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:01,170
Miss, Miss!
Telephone lady!

60
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,630
- Telephone?
- I'll be right back.

61
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:25,569
Hello, Aunt Amalia!

62
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:29,682
Maerose!

63
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,453
Pop actually invited me
to my own sisters wedding.

64
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:36,497
Imagine that.

65
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:39,010
He must be getting soft in his old age.

66
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:41,627
Cara, let me look at ya'.

67
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:46,423
So Aunt Amalia
what do you think?

68
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,747
Such a one.

69
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,511
Always making
a show of yourself.

70
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:54,265
Come on Aunt Amalia,
I got a reputation to live up to.

71
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:56,209
I'm the family scandal.

72
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,978
Everybody be disappointed
if I stopped.

73
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:02,924
Have you paid your respects
to your father yet?

74
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:13,357
- Do I have to?
- Sure you have to.

75
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,162
Come on, lets' go together.

76
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:23,863
Hello Pappa!

77
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:26,285
Dominic! Dominic!

78
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,155
She came to pay you her respects.

79
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:29,749
Speak to her!

80
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,478
Then how come she ain't
dressed right...

81
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:34,348
If she's so respectful?

82
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,847
How come she show's up
at a family wedding...

83
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:39,853
dressed like a Badonna Dialo?

84
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:44,774
Don't worry Aunt Amalia,
he'll get his one day.

85
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:48,267
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

86
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:32,646
Where's the lady
you took to the telephone?

87
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,284
Where's the lady
you took to the telephone?

88
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,411
How should I know mister?

89
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,163
Who told you to go get her?

90
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,613
Some old guy, I don't know.

91
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,210
An old guy.

92
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:45,628
Ok.
Here.

93
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:48,214
Watch out for them conolli's.

94
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,014
Thanks mister.

95
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:54,637
Hello Charley.

96
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:57,014
- Hi Maerose.
- Hi.

97
00:16:57,191 --> 00:17:00,684
- How are you Mae?
- Fine Charley, and you?

98
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,954
Fine too.

99
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:08,470
So how's the decorating
business?

100
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,320
Oh, it's just great Charley,
we're always busy.

101
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,239
Everything is art deco now.

102
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:14,374
Art who?

103
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:17,786
You know art deco,
after art nouveau.

104
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:20,080
It's a style it's not a person.

105
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:24,219
Like all that art stuff.

106
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:32,966
God!
Damn!

107
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,749
What's the matter Mae?

108
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:41,017
I should have known to stay away.

109
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:42,561
What happened?

110
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:48,066
I went to say hello to my father,
and he called me a whore.

111
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,195
Maerose, I'm sorry.

112
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,490
Listen Mae what you gotta do
is forget about your father.

113
00:17:58,689 --> 00:18:00,075
Forget about the alignment.

114
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:01,997
They never gonna take you back
anyway.

115
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:04,416
So screw them.
They don't deserve you.

116
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:10,213
Especially that fucking Dominic.

117
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,034
Mae, you are still beautiful.

118
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:19,288
Why don't you find yourself someone
who has nothing to do with the family?

119
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:22,792
Settle down,
couple of kids.

120
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:24,411
A life.

121
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,507
Practice your meatballs.

122
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:33,675
Sure Charley.
Thanks a lot.

123
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:36,473
You're a big help.

124
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,658
Are you the guy
who took the pictures?

125
00:18:57,758 --> 00:18:58,755
Yeah.

126
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:01,508
- So when do I get to see them?
- They're in the lab, Mr. Partanna.

127
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,789
I'll make sure I get them to you
as soon as they're out.

128
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,074
About noon tomorrow.

129
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:07,869
- Ok, meanwhile give me her name.
- Her name?

130
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:13,301
- Yeah her name, for Christ's sake.
- Mr. Partanna I didn't get no name.

131
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,262
I thought you knew her.

132
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:16,763
Oh for Christ's sake's!

133
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:38,286
- Hello.
- Mae.

134
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:42,866
She ain't here.
You wanna leave a message?

135
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:46,377
- Who is this?
- This is the girl.

136
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,422
Ask her, this is very important.

137
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:52,738
Ask her if she knows a woman
at the wedding...

138
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,639
who wore a lavender dress.

139
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,257
- You got it?
- I got it.

140
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,924
Make sure she calls me.
You hear?

141
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,186
Now what's your name?
I'm gonna send you ten bucks.

142
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:09,447
Ten bucks?
Miss Peaches.

143
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:11,348
Ok, Peaches.

144
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:14,598
You tell Miss Prizzi
she has to call me...

145
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,741
no matter how late, tonight.

146
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:19,786
- Ok.
- Peaches thank you.

147
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:20,921
Bye, bye.

148
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:42,517
Hey Partanna!

149
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:45,728
Gallagher!
Homicide!

150
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,108
What's up?

151
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:51,568
Somebody tagged Sally
Turbino this afternoon.

152
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:53,246
Yeah?

153
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:54,947
Who dunnit?

154
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:57,449
Where were you between
two and five today?

155
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:00,402
I was at the wedding.

156
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,713
Corrado Prizzi's
granddaughter's wedding.

157
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:08,043
They're all gonna turn out
to be at the wedding.

158
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:11,077
Come on!
We're taking you in!

159
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,971
You couldn't be cleaner?

160
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,730
- Who made the hit bob?
- We did.

161
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:32,563
We did? How come we did?
I don't know nothing about it.

162
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:41,546
Well that's the best way in it.

163
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:43,078
Who hit him?

164
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,991
I don't tell.
It was a specialist job.

165
00:21:46,144 --> 00:21:47,555
How come?

166
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:50,958
Dominic told me to set it up so
he couldn't have nothing to do with it.

167
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:53,172
We was all at the wedding.

168
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,341
- Mae?
- Charley?

169
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:10,119
Did you have any luck?

170
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,764
What kind of a message was that?

171
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:16,190
Who can remember
a girl in a lavender dress?

172
00:22:16,496 --> 00:22:19,225
I was wearing a pink and black
dress.

173
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:23,736
So you don't know
who she is...

174
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:28,532
the woman in the lavender dress?

175
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,442
Oh, go suck your head!

176
00:22:42,098 --> 00:22:43,096
Yeah?

177
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:46,204
Mr. Partanna please.
It's Irene Walker calling.

178
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:47,478
What?

179
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:50,129
- Is this Charley Partanna?
- Yeah, yeah.

180
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:53,440
I hope you don't mind
my calling so late.

181
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:57,228
I wanted to apologise for running
out the way I did this afternoon.

182
00:22:57,572 --> 00:23:00,856
This is you?
Irene walker?

183
00:23:02,243 --> 00:23:06,010
I recognise the voice,
but I didn't get your name before.

184
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:09,934
I just wanted to explain.
I hope you don't think I'm rude.

185
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:14,496
Rude? Oh, no, no.
You could never be rude.

186
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:18,114
So listen um.
Well...

187
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:22,379
Why don't we get together later,
for like a late dinner?

188
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:24,454
When you mean tonight?

189
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,592
I could pick you up in half an hour.

190
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,552
I live in California.

191
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,470
California?

192
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:33,307
Yeah, that's where I live.
I had to come home.

193
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:40,194
How about lunch tomorrow?

194
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:42,316
Alright.

195
00:23:42,743 --> 00:23:46,486
How about the bar
at the Bell Age hotel?

196
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:51,354
That would be tremendous.
What time?

197
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,911
- About two?
- Great.

198
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:22,273
I was scared I was never
gonna see you again.

199
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,896
Dos zumos de piña
con BacardÍ.

200
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:37,538
What was that you said?

201
00:24:37,716 --> 00:24:40,583
I ordered us a drink
something I think you'll like.

202
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,412
Say it again.

203
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:46,422
Zumo de piña
con Bacardi.

204
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:49,592
What is it some Puerto Rican
or something?

205
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:53,972
Yes, I guess it could be.
Pineapple juice with rum.

206
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,474
I had it in Cuba.

207
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:59,852
What were you doing in Cuba?

208
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:02,451
I was on my honeymoon.

209
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:08,766
I didn't know you was married.

210
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:11,403
My husband left me 4 years ago.

211
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,929
I don't know where he's.
I don't wanna know.

212
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,744
He left you!

213
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,414
Crazy huh!

214
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,002
I could find him for you.

215
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:26,504
Let him stay lost!

216
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:33,304
Well you might wanna
get married again someday.

217
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,540
Maybe...

218
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:38,260
but until that happens...

219
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:40,811
I don't wanna know about him.

220
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:45,925
What about you?
Are you married?

221
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:51,566
Once I was almost married.

222
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,325
Mae rose was her name.

223
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:57,244
We grew up together.

224
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:02,666
One night we had a big fight...

225
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:05,127
because I was dancing too much
with another girl.

226
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,294
I suppose I did it on purpose...

227
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:10,145
because I wanted
to make her jealous.

228
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:14,836
So she flew off to Mexico
with the guy.

229
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,644
Shacks up in a hotel...

230
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:20,632
Father sends some goons down there
to clobber the guy.

231
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:27,347
Brings her back to the States and
don't let her back into his house.

232
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:29,981
That was 4 years ago.

233
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:31,728
That's it?

234
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,112
Yeah, she can't even go
to Brooklyn any more.

235
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:37,326
Only unless it's a special occasion...

236
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:39,914
weddings, funerals,
stuff like that.

237
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:42,499
We're still friends.

238
00:26:44,114 --> 00:26:45,214
She's in decorating.

239
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:48,253
She did my apartment,
real nice job she did too.

240
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,425
That's some family you got.

241
00:26:53,187 --> 00:26:56,179
Anyway...
I like you coat.

242
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:02,133
Do you?
A coat like this...

243
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,647
stand out in New York,
you know.

244
00:27:05,782 --> 00:27:08,775
My father always says
it's better...

245
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:12,474
to stand out because
of how serious you are...

246
00:27:12,627 --> 00:27:16,825
instead of clothes, cars
or diamond rings...

247
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,893
For men that is.

248
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:22,372
What am I doing all
the talking here for?

249
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,083
How come I met you
at a Prizzi's wedding...

250
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:26,669
and you ain't no wop?

251
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:30,133
The Bishop who married them
wasn't Italian.

252
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,923
No he's a Polak.

253
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:34,509
So am I.

254
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,591
Walker is a Polak name?

255
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,176
No, it was Walkervisks.

256
00:27:39,562 --> 00:27:40,584
I shortened it.

257
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:43,531
My maiden name was
Irene Walkervisks.

258
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:46,990
Either way...

259
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:51,063
you're sure one
beautiful woman to me.

260
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,028
I guess I thought that Walker sounded
more like a tax consultant should.

261
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,596
You're a tax
consultant?

262
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,398
What do you do
when you consult?

263
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,661
I save people money.

264
00:28:04,797 --> 00:28:07,330
Show them the angles.
There are a lot of angles.

265
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:09,499
This L. A corporation...

266
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:12,085
had a guy kidnapped
in the Middle East...

267
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:15,961
so I told them they ran some money
that was tax deductible staff loss.

268
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:18,592
- Things like that.
- Terrific.

269
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:22,559
Shall we...

270
00:28:23,774 --> 00:28:26,763
- ...go?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

271
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:29,144
We'll take my car.

272
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:34,191
- What kind of a car is this?
- An Excaliber.

273
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:36,891
Japanese make them in England
for the Arabian market.

274
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:38,624
Great California car.

275
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:44,117
It's a great anyplace car.
Jesus it must cost though huh?

276
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:48,288
Well it wasn't free but
think what'll cost in two years.

277
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:51,409
- Like to eat outside?
- Yeah.

278
00:28:58,142 --> 00:29:01,343
Irene I gotta say it.

279
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:03,429
I can't sleep.

280
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,596
I'm a grown man middle aged
maybe...

281
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:09,435
but no...

282
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:13,186
nobody in my life has ever
affected me anything...

283
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:17,224
like the way that
you make me feel.

284
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,990
I love you.

285
00:29:25,624 --> 00:29:28,955
That's it.
That's everything.

286
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:32,583
I love you.

287
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:37,380
I think I'm in love with you
too Charley.

288
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,991
No it ain't in love.

289
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,075
In love is temporary.

290
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:43,793
Then you move on
to the next in love.

291
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:47,306
Everybody is always falling
in and out of love.

292
00:29:47,606 --> 00:29:50,058
I notice.
I remember everything...

293
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:52,937
I read about it in magazines.

294
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:56,847
When you're just in love
it's just...

295
00:29:57,953 --> 00:29:59,527
Wait a minute.

296
00:30:00,997 --> 00:30:03,579
A hormonal secretion...

297
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:05,908
which changes the senses smells.

298
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:09,078
So as to affect someone
in a certain way.

299
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:13,751
That's what in love is.
Who needs it.

300
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,270
Love.
I mean, I love you

301
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:24,427
I think that's sounds
like I'm hedging, but...

302
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:28,724
I don't know how to say it
because I've never said it before.

303
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:32,603
All my life I've had
to protect myself and...

304
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:36,899
you can't protect yourself from
anything when you love somebody.

305
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:40,778
I love you Charley.

306
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,116
What's that they're playing?

307
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:50,245
That's "Noche de Ronda."

308
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:53,123
I'm never gonna
forget it.

309
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:57,323
I'm never gonna forget
this dress.

310
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:02,049
I'm never gonna forget anything
about today.

311
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:05,969
Wherever we go
whatever it is...

312
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:08,472
whenever they play this song...

313
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,310
this is gonna be our song.

314
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:51,532
Irene!

315
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:58,119
Everything being equal...

316
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:00,694
would you marry me?

317
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:04,128
Everything being equal...

318
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,366
I'd marry you tonight

319
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,731
Oh, yeah!

320
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:45,088
Have a cigar!

321
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,533
My favourites.
From Mexico.

322
00:32:53,381 --> 00:32:55,414
Smell delicious!

323
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,918
Charley come in.
You know Cyril, don't you?

324
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:00,753
Hello Charley nice to see ya'.

325
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:03,483
- Wanna cigar Charley?
- No, thanks.

326
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:05,927
Sit down!

327
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:10,054
Now Cyril,
you tell him...

328
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,934
what happened at the big casino
with those dirty bastards.

329
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:18,938
I've been President of the Prizzi's
casinos in Vegas for 20 years...

330
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:22,108
and I have never seen
a scam like this before.

331
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,599
I've got 14 phony I.O.U.

332
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,343
They come to $722.085.

333
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:35,009
Now when the collectors go to
pick up the money...

334
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:37,238
the player that signed the I.O. U
is dead...

335
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,764
from some bad cold or something
before he signed the paper.

336
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:43,510
Or else he was someplace else and
he wasn't in Vegas to sign it.

337
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:46,691
Every piece of paper is counter-signed,
that's house rules...

338
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:49,287
by Louis Paul,
the acting manager...

339
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,249
and the man in the cage,
Marxie Heller.

340
00:33:51,372 --> 00:33:53,240
They had to be working together.

341
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:54,805
I don't get it.

342
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:59,037
Louis takes paper to the cage
all he gets back is chips.

343
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:01,456
- That's house rules too.
- Yeah.

344
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:03,792
Now the big boss tells me
there's a woman in it.

345
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:06,044
He says that he twice saw Louis...

346
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,878
bring two big racks of $1.000
plates to this woman.

347
00:34:09,123 --> 00:34:12,759
She went to cashiers window but
he didn't think anything of it.

348
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:16,818
So where's Louis and Heller?

349
00:34:17,094 --> 00:34:18,723
Louis caught it.
A bullet in the head.

350
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:21,263
Heller is hauled up in L. A
He's got a wife out there.

351
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:23,937
They found Louis laid out
in the front seat of his car...

352
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:26,398
in the parking lot of Leone's bar
way out on the street.

353
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:32,518
I knew Louis when he was a helper
on an ice truck 30 years ago.

354
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:34,781
We taught him his trade.

355
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:38,160
He wasn't smart enough to figure
a scam like this.

356
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:41,437
So I guess the first thing to do...

357
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,832
is to find Marxie Heller.

358
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:45,750
I remember him now.

359
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,451
He always wore
a silver toupe on the job.

360
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:52,883
He had dark brown bags under his eyes
as if he had coffee grounds in 'em.

361
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,467
That's him.

362
00:34:54,712 --> 00:34:58,084
He was good with figures, steady.
But he got T.B.

363
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,077
Charley...

364
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:03,756
Louis Palo was thief
but he was ours.

365
00:35:04,124 --> 00:35:07,834
Heller must have iced him
So you ice Heller.

366
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:16,407
Ok.

367
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,450
What do you want my friend?

368
00:36:29,263 --> 00:36:31,072
The Prizzis sent me.

369
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,824
Where is your wife Mr. Heller?

370
00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:38,794
She's at the supermarket.

371
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,423
And just who are you?

372
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:44,758
Charley Partanna.

373
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:49,068
Where's the money Marxie?

374
00:36:49,406 --> 00:36:52,195
Straight arrow Charley.

375
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:55,269
The old American hood.

376
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,679
I don't know what
you're talking about.

377
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:02,957
Get up onto your feet!
Come on!

378
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:07,310
Put your hands up!

379
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,658
I think you broke my wrist.

380
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:23,344
You won't need it.

381
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:24,831
Come on!

382
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:37,048
I'm home, dear!

383
00:38:39,102 --> 00:38:41,984
Marxie's not here, Mrs. Heller.

384
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:57,932
Charley!

385
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:03,322
What are you doing here?

386
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,576
Why didn't you call first?
You always call first!

387
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:11,432
Charley!

388
00:39:16,381 --> 00:39:18,590
Marxie Heller's wife?

389
00:39:22,637 --> 00:39:25,120
You married to Marxie Heller?

390
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:32,264
- Where's the money?
- Money?

391
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,138
No bullshit.

392
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:37,767
Your husband killed Louis Palo
for the money, where is it?

393
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:41,845
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've knocked me for whoop here.

394
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:43,523
- Where Is Marxie?
- Dead.

395
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:45,661
In the trunk of his car.

396
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:47,685
Stop this cheap bullshit!

397
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:50,046
Where's the money
that your husband and Louis Palo...

398
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,376
scammed from the Prizzi's
in Las Vegas?

399
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,588
Maybe I...

400
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,748
I do know something about it.

401
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:04,118
He had a bag with him.
I'll show you.

402
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,301
It could be in here.

403
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:13,303
It's the only place I know
it could be.

404
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,604
You sure?

405
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,856
I'm sure.

406
00:40:35,294 --> 00:40:39,375
I got $360.000 here.
Half.

407
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:40,835
Half?

408
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:43,250
Don't keep telling me
what I just said.

409
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:45,507
Where is the rest of the money?

410
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,380
I didn't even know
the money was there.

411
00:40:48,557 --> 00:40:50,300
How could I know
it was short?

412
00:40:51,087 --> 00:40:53,136
When Marxie came home
three nights ago...

413
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:55,563
after being away from
me for five years...

414
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:58,353
he threw that bag in the closet.
That's all I know.

415
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:02,338
Did you ask him why he came back
to you after five years?

416
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,772
Charley please try and understand.

417
00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:10,069
I was glad when Marxie
showed up because...

418
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:14,282
it gave me a chance to
ask him for the divorce.

419
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:16,492
You wanna know what I remember?

420
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:18,867
I remember you coming in that door
and saying...

421
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:19,964
"I'm home dear".

422
00:41:20,064 --> 00:41:22,530
Is that the way you ask for a divorce
these days...

423
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:25,209
Mrs. Heller?

424
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,754
Charley, I could see
how sick he was.

425
00:41:28,797 --> 00:41:33,150
I didn't need to ask him.
He only had a few weeks left.

426
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:38,514
Oh, Marxie.

427
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:44,395
In all the years I knew
Marxie Heller...

428
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:48,316
he never yelled at me
or hit me...

429
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:50,318
or stole my money.

430
00:41:51,955 --> 00:41:53,696
He was my friend.

431
00:41:55,531 --> 00:41:56,447
If it wasn't for him.

432
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:59,946
I'd probably still be earning
my living on my back...

433
00:42:00,422 --> 00:42:03,248
with half of your pals
in Chicago.

434
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:07,242
It was his idea to study
book keeping and...

435
00:42:08,472 --> 00:42:10,768
he got me a job
on the main wire too.

436
00:42:10,983 --> 00:42:13,558
Then he talked them into
making me a courier.

437
00:42:13,936 --> 00:42:15,466
He told me to study tax laws...

438
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,820
while I was flying back and forth
to Switzerland.

439
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:24,009
He was always there for me,
like nobody else in my life.

440
00:42:24,656 --> 00:42:25,844
And I loved him.

441
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,472
Not like I love you,
But I loved him.

442
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:34,443
And that's the Gods honest truth.
And If you don't believe me,

443
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:36,991
why don't you just kill me
and get over with?

444
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:47,319
I can't.

445
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:55,050
I can't change the way
I feel about you.

446
00:42:55,622 --> 00:42:57,052
I look at you...

447
00:42:58,657 --> 00:43:00,895
and I see what I wanna see.

448
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,306
That's what love is.

449
00:43:05,406 --> 00:43:08,376
If you were anybody else
I'd blow you away.

450
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,985
But I can't.

451
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,278
I have to believe this.

452
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,495
Well how'd it go out there?

453
00:43:27,177 --> 00:43:28,177
Okay.

454
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:32,626
I brought back 360.000 dollars.

455
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:34,466
How come only half?

456
00:43:35,386 --> 00:43:38,666
I talked to Heller
he won't say nothing.

457
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:44,430
So I pay him off with a bing.
Then the wife comes home.

458
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:46,482
We talk.

459
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,772
No problem.

460
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:51,399
She's brings me the money
which she thinks is there...

461
00:43:51,535 --> 00:43:54,444
cause he brought a satchel home
with him when he came.

462
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,737
I count.

463
00:43:55,873 --> 00:43:57,736
It's only half.

464
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:00,158
You worked her over?

465
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,410
No, she was scared.

466
00:44:02,546 --> 00:44:05,695
She knew I'd tapped her husband.
I think she was telling the truth.

467
00:44:06,964 --> 00:44:08,895
What happened to Louis split?

468
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,295
I don't know Dominic.

469
00:44:13,004 --> 00:44:16,836
Somebody has got
our 360.000 dollars.

470
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:20,766
Find it.

471
00:44:24,652 --> 00:44:25,652
Okay.

472
00:44:35,496 --> 00:44:38,818
When I close my eyes
and you're cooking, Charley...

473
00:44:39,646 --> 00:44:41,792
I think your mamma
is still with us.

474
00:44:42,037 --> 00:44:43,703
Thanks Poppa.

475
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,528
Pop...

476
00:44:48,651 --> 00:44:52,929
do you think Dominic believes
that I copped that other 360?

477
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:55,689
What the hell Charley.
The money had to go someplace.

478
00:44:55,895 --> 00:44:57,857
Dominic hates your guts anyway.

479
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:01,965
Yeah that's getting real bad.
He never lets up.

480
00:45:02,088 --> 00:45:05,074
He don't eat right.
He never eats like this.

481
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:09,293
He's got heartburn from
that place he eats at all the time.

482
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:13,040
They make garbage.
It's not like this.

483
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:18,212
Well the man can't hate me
cause he don't eat right Pop.

484
00:45:19,223 --> 00:45:20,483
Charley...

485
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:25,266
believe me, I know how
that mind of Dominics' works.

486
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:27,289
His life turned out miserable.

487
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,152
He has to blame someone.
Every time he sees you...

488
00:45:31,305 --> 00:45:35,856
he's reminded of the shame Maerose
put on you, on him, and on the whole family.

489
00:45:36,075 --> 00:45:37,315
You forgot.

490
00:45:37,805 --> 00:45:39,067
Not Dominic.

491
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:43,905
He probably worked it all around
so the whole mess is all your fault.

492
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:46,658
Get it out of your head,
out of your head.

493
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:50,318
Great dinner Charley!

494
00:45:50,896 --> 00:45:51,896
Now.

495
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:54,541
What's the occasion?

496
00:45:55,863 --> 00:45:58,653
I wanna show you a woman.

497
00:45:58,898 --> 00:46:02,117
The one that I went to California
to see about.

498
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:06,931
Isn't she beautiful?

499
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,383
I like her.

500
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:12,476
Kind of darker and
more round woman myself.

501
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,811
See you got a picture of me
with her.

502
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,041
- Pop what are you doing?
- Jesus Charley!

503
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:40,103
She was the one we brought in
to make the Turbino hit.

504
00:46:40,347 --> 00:46:42,339
She was a speciality hitter.

505
00:46:55,034 --> 00:46:57,763
Charley let me give you a hand
with the dishes.

506
00:46:57,946 --> 00:47:02,777
No, it's ok.
I'll just stack.

507
00:47:03,465 --> 00:47:06,030
The girl'll take care of that
in the morning.

508
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,166
Thanks.

509
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,462
Alright.

510
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,829
Then, I'll just head on home.

511
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,832
Getting late by my clock.

512
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,460
- Great dinner Charley.
- Thanks.

513
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:22,077
- Goodnight Pop.
- Night son.

514
00:47:23,086 --> 00:47:24,711
Thanks a lot.

515
00:48:09,563 --> 00:48:11,805
Maerose?
Charley.

516
00:48:11,941 --> 00:48:14,838
What is this?
It's 00:45 a.m.

517
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:17,592
It's the second time
you've called me in four years.

518
00:48:17,947 --> 00:48:18,947
Mae.

519
00:48:21,117 --> 00:48:22,775
Mae, listen.

520
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:25,235
I broke that vase.

521
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:27,371
What vase?

522
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:32,313
That special vase
that matches the rug.

523
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:35,931
The one you knocked your self out
trying to find.

524
00:48:36,382 --> 00:48:38,947
Charley what are you out
of your mind.

525
00:48:39,844 --> 00:48:42,586
- You alone?
- Course I'm alone.

526
00:48:45,098 --> 00:48:46,968
I gotta see ya'.

527
00:48:59,477 --> 00:49:01,355
What's with you?

528
00:49:02,757 --> 00:49:04,108
We gotta talk.

529
00:49:05,118 --> 00:49:09,280
You wanna talk out here
or you wanna sit down and talk?

530
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:11,584
Sure.

531
00:49:19,009 --> 00:49:21,876
Oh, this is a beautiful set up
you got here Mae.

532
00:49:22,012 --> 00:49:25,230
The colours are right.
That's what counts.

533
00:49:25,444 --> 00:49:29,553
Everybody sees shapes differently
but colours are forever.

534
00:49:29,859 --> 00:49:30,859
Yeah.

535
00:49:33,398 --> 00:49:35,378
Why'd you call, Charley?

536
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:40,621
We wasted a lot of time Mae.

537
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:42,920
Four years you call that
a lot of time?

538
00:49:43,073 --> 00:49:45,005
How come you didn't wait
till I was 50?

539
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:50,655
You could have been a fat wop
broad by the time you were 50.

540
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,411
You wanna do it Charley?
Is that what you want?

541
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:08,980
Whoah take it easy!
What the hell Mae!

542
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,640
Nobody took it slower than me
Charley.

543
00:50:14,064 --> 00:50:15,694
Four years.

544
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,517
Answer the question
do you wanna do it?

545
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:21,896
Well, yeah.

546
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:23,282
So...

547
00:50:24,742 --> 00:50:26,484
let's do it.

548
00:50:30,665 --> 00:50:32,158
With all the lights on?

549
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,572
Yeah right here on the oriental.

550
00:50:37,247 --> 00:50:39,393
With all the lights on.

551
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:44,329
Mamma Mia!

552
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:53,336
Thanks.

553
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:03,479
What's your problem Charley?

554
00:51:04,778 --> 00:51:07,566
It certainly isn't
your God damned face.

555
00:51:09,684 --> 00:51:12,332
How can I tell you
with all people?

556
00:51:13,455 --> 00:51:16,158
But I got nobody else I can talk to.

557
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,122
It's about a woman.

558
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:25,793
Go ahead.

559
00:51:26,576 --> 00:51:28,004
Tell me anyway.

560
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:32,801
How can I feel worse than
I used to feel before last night.

561
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:38,755
We grew up together.
We're the same people.

562
00:51:40,802 --> 00:51:44,271
What the hell Charley,
the calendar takes care of everything.

563
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:51,820
I met her in a church.

564
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:54,114
Just happened.

565
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,242
I knew she was the woman for me.

566
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:03,457
She'd organised a scam in Vegas.

567
00:52:04,777 --> 00:52:07,996
I go looking for the bad guy and
it turns out to be my woman.

568
00:52:08,149 --> 00:52:09,619
Can you imagine this?

569
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:11,757
Not only that.

570
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,956
Pop tells me...

571
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:17,846
she's the piece man
for the Turbino contract.

572
00:52:19,278 --> 00:52:20,505
But just the same.

573
00:52:20,689 --> 00:52:22,059
I love her Mae.

574
00:52:22,945 --> 00:52:24,214
I love her.

575
00:52:25,364 --> 00:52:26,364
Well.

576
00:52:27,464 --> 00:52:31,458
Can I live with this?
I gotta do something about.

577
00:52:31,558 --> 00:52:33,195
I gotta straighten it out.

578
00:52:33,622 --> 00:52:35,160
Then do.

579
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:39,022
Do what? Do I ice her?
Do I marry her?

580
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:40,870
Which one of these?

581
00:52:41,598 --> 00:52:43,407
Marry her Charley.

582
00:52:44,426 --> 00:52:46,626
Just because she's a thief
and a hitter...

583
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:49,670
doesn't mean she isn't a good
woman in all the other departments.

584
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:54,133
If she was some kind of fashion model
it wouldn't last more than 30 days.

585
00:52:54,686 --> 00:52:57,512
But you and she is in the same
line of business.

586
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,139
You're lucky you've found each other.
You know that Charley?

587
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:05,757
Yeah.
She's an American.

588
00:53:06,278 --> 00:53:09,357
She had a chance to make a buck
so she grabbed it.

589
00:53:10,493 --> 00:53:12,103
Marry her Charley...

590
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:16,155
and at least I'll be able
to get something out of it.

591
00:53:16,824 --> 00:53:19,617
I'll be able to go back
in the family.

592
00:53:22,496 --> 00:53:23,496
Yeah.

593
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,133
Thanks.

594
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:35,299
Shall we have them play
"Noche de Ronda"?

595
00:53:36,436 --> 00:53:37,434
Yeah.

596
00:53:37,534 --> 00:53:38,678
Would you ask them?

597
00:53:45,862 --> 00:53:47,882
I've been all shook up.

598
00:53:48,157 --> 00:53:49,157
Why?

599
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:52,276
I know everything.

600
00:53:53,412 --> 00:53:55,028
I know you made
the hit on Turbino...

601
00:53:55,164 --> 00:53:57,938
after the wedding reception
when we met.

602
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:02,036
I know you've been scamming us
with Louis and your husband.

603
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:10,048
I did the work on Turbino.

604
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:13,797
I had nothing to do with
what Marxie and his partner did.

605
00:54:14,976 --> 00:54:17,301
Louis Paulo was so suspicious...

606
00:54:17,498 --> 00:54:20,809
that he checked the car for bombs
every time he started it.

607
00:54:20,943 --> 00:54:22,970
But he would have let some
beautiful broad

608
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,959
walk over get in
and sit on his face.

609
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:31,447
No matter how you got it
in your head Charley, you're wrong.

610
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:34,620
I had nothing to do with it.
Nothing.

611
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,332
Charley.

612
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:44,995
Did you mean it that first night
when you asked me if I'd marry you?

613
00:54:47,091 --> 00:54:48,499
Charley?

614
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,680
Alright.

615
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:59,719
The Prizzi's are gonna have
to believe me cause I believe you.

616
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:05,417
So could we get married.

617
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,395
What you say we have one of those
pineapple drinks?

618
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,647
The honeymoon has already started.

619
00:55:10,782 --> 00:55:12,530
Kiss me Charley.

620
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:15,285
In public?

621
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:21,758
Pop?
Charley.

622
00:55:22,126 --> 00:55:23,201
I'm in L.A.

623
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,817
And that ain't all.
I'm gonna get married.

624
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:29,790
The same woman?
The contractor?

625
00:55:30,005 --> 00:55:32,427
Yeah, she's Polish...

626
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:34,972
but the family will get used
to that gradually.

627
00:55:35,217 --> 00:55:36,631
Yeah, when she walks in a room...

628
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:39,417
the rest of the women of family
are gonna have to shut up.

629
00:55:39,846 --> 00:55:41,383
But I know how you feel
about her Charley.

630
00:55:41,483 --> 00:55:44,322
I'd not try to stop nature.
Good luck, son.

631
00:55:44,537 --> 00:55:47,174
- Thanks Pop.
- Say. Listen.

632
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:50,603
The Don wants you here for
a big meeting tomorrow night.

633
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:54,746
Jesus, Pop what about
my honeymoon?

634
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:57,720
So you'll have it in Brooklyn.

635
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:00,039
Shit!

636
00:56:46,897 --> 00:56:50,545
So what do you say
we go for some confetti...

637
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,163
and maybe a couple of pictures?

638
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,795
Whatever you say honey.

639
00:56:56,554 --> 00:57:01,153
If only Marxie could see me now.

640
00:57:02,624 --> 00:57:03,790
What's so funny?

641
00:57:03,973 --> 00:57:07,039
Me marrying a Sicilian.

642
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:10,257
I can hear him.
He always used to say:

643
00:57:10,749 --> 00:57:13,416
"The Jews are bad enough
in this business...

644
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,850
but the Sicilians'd rather eat
their children than part with money.

645
00:57:17,003 --> 00:57:19,578
And they're very fond
of their children".

646
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:27,580
Marxie Heller is so fucking smart,
how come he's so fucking dead?

647
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:28,856
Next.

648
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:16,835
The man at the end of the table...

649
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:19,240
is Mr. Alvin Gomski.

650
00:58:19,424 --> 00:58:24,134
He's Treasurer of 18 Lodges Bank
in the United States...

651
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:27,804
of which we own 25%.

652
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:32,086
Now I asked Mr. Gomski
to come here today...

653
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:36,105
so you can hear from his own mouth
what has been happening.

654
00:58:37,022 --> 00:58:39,168
The bank president
Mr. Robert Finlay...

655
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,989
is stealing from the bank...

656
00:58:42,265 --> 00:58:44,353
mainly through crooked
foreign exchange deals.

657
00:58:44,697 --> 00:58:46,689
If he's allowed to continue...

658
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:48,857
the bank will go under
in less than a year.

659
00:58:49,224 --> 00:58:51,523
Thank you Mr. Gomski.

660
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:56,657
Harry go.
See Mr. Gomski to his car.

661
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:06,301
Robert Finlay's real name
is...

662
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:08,631
Rosario Filargi.

663
00:59:08,907 --> 00:59:13,757
Now anybody who changes his
name from Filargi to Finlay...

664
00:59:13,873 --> 00:59:15,926
is also stupid enough...

665
00:59:16,062 --> 00:59:20,343
to think that we wouldn't
protect our 25 percent.

666
00:59:20,864 --> 00:59:23,267
Tell them our plan Eduardo.

667
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:29,607
We are gonna kidnap Filargi.

668
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,618
He's covered with two and a half
million in kidnap insurance.

669
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,238
That's the tag on him
and we make the snatch.

670
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:39,136
We know the insurance company
is gonna pay cause...

671
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:42,938
as Charley has already pointed out,
that money is tax deductible

672
00:59:44,216 --> 00:59:46,463
We're also gonna leave a trail...

673
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:50,545
so that the Feds think Filargi
organised the whole thing.

674
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:53,840
Cheating the bank,
milking the insurance company.

675
00:59:56,428 --> 00:59:58,261
When the mierda hits the fan...

676
00:59:59,616 --> 01:00:01,733
we'll be able to buy another
good size chunk of the bank...

677
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,767
for about 10 cents on the dollar.

678
01:00:03,902 --> 01:00:05,727
We get control and interest.

679
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,687
Eventually...

680
01:00:09,181 --> 01:00:13,318
we stand to make
sixty seventy million dollars.

681
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:16,540
Thank you, Eduardo, my son.

682
01:00:18,134 --> 01:00:22,410
Some men suffer most
when you take their lives.

683
01:00:22,588 --> 01:00:25,461
Life is what is sweetest to them.

684
01:00:25,614 --> 01:00:29,793
For Filargi money is sweetest.

685
01:00:30,796 --> 01:00:36,284
We'll leave him with his life and
without money or anywhere to get it.

686
01:00:37,173 --> 01:00:40,085
Well done Don Corrado.
That's beautiful.

687
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:43,090
I almost feel sorry for the guy.

688
01:00:43,764 --> 01:00:45,328
Beautiful is right.

689
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,884
I like most beautiful things, Charley.

690
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:51,214
This one is very simple.

691
01:00:51,366 --> 01:00:53,150
We rely on you.

692
01:00:57,101 --> 01:00:58,603
How do you want me to handle it?

693
01:00:58,818 --> 01:01:01,826
Pick your own people.
We don't wanna know.

694
01:01:10,805 --> 01:01:15,128
Dominic my son stay with me
a moment.

695
01:01:20,892 --> 01:01:24,295
Maerose has written to me, Dominic.

696
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:29,437
The man she wronged
has married another woman.

697
01:01:30,089 --> 01:01:32,554
Now Maerose has suffered,
Dominic...

698
01:01:32,826 --> 01:01:37,325
as you have suffered during
the years of her disgrace.

699
01:01:38,748 --> 01:01:43,364
Now honour is protected,
I beg you...

700
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:45,536
on my knees...

701
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,852
show compassion.

702
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:53,451
Here.
Here read her letter.

703
01:01:55,383 --> 01:01:59,092
Look how the child loves you.

704
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:02,342
She wants to take care of you.

705
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,560
Send her to me Poppa.

706
01:02:10,804 --> 01:02:12,796
She's my daughter again.

707
01:02:13,594 --> 01:02:16,109
What we gotta do is take care
of the bodyguard...

708
01:02:16,245 --> 01:02:19,363
and get Filargi down to
our van in the basement.

709
01:02:19,498 --> 01:02:21,281
- Ok?
- Ok.

710
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:23,956
There's only three apartments
on the floor.

711
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:27,045
This one is Filargi's.
We get the other two.

712
01:02:27,145 --> 01:02:28,454
How are you gonna do that?

713
01:02:29,444 --> 01:02:32,265
One of them is empty,
this one we rent it.

714
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,836
The other one,
we send matinee theater tickets...

715
01:02:34,972 --> 01:02:38,257
and heavy duty lunch invitation
to the dame that lives there.

716
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:40,839
A limo picks her up
and brings her back.

717
01:02:40,939 --> 01:02:43,387
She thinks it's a prize
she's getting...

718
01:02:43,522 --> 01:02:47,057
for working at the public library
for sixty years.

719
01:02:47,193 --> 01:02:49,142
She'll go alright.

720
01:02:49,495 --> 01:02:53,542
Everyday Filargi's bodyguard
comes out first.

721
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:55,535
He goes to the elevator,
pushes the button.

722
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:57,803
When he gets there,
he puts it on hold.

723
01:02:57,995 --> 01:03:01,298
Then he goes back to the apartment
and knocks on the door.

724
01:03:01,421 --> 01:03:03,699
That's when Filargi comes out.

725
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:07,399
You know guys, you need a woman
on this stand.

726
01:03:08,472 --> 01:03:11,196
- A woman?
- Yeah.

727
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:14,390
A woman comes out of
the south apartment holding a baby.

728
01:03:14,596 --> 01:03:17,880
After Filargi's bodyguard gets him
out of his apartment.

729
01:03:18,016 --> 01:03:20,338
She smiles at them,
she goes gogo gaga at the baby.

730
01:03:20,438 --> 01:03:22,674
She tosses the little darling
at the bodyguard...

731
01:03:22,774 --> 01:03:24,175
who naturally tries to catch it.

732
01:03:24,275 --> 01:03:27,223
While he's doing that, she gets her
piece out and covers him.

733
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:30,914
You come out of the other apartment
and take Filargi down to the garage.

734
01:03:31,037 --> 01:03:34,595
She takes the bodyguard back into
Filargi's apartment and does the job.

735
01:03:35,033 --> 01:03:36,832
That's good.

736
01:03:37,285 --> 01:03:39,438
For Christ sake.

737
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,529
Where we gonna get a baby?

738
01:03:41,665 --> 01:03:44,557
Where we gonna find a broad
who would do something like this?

739
01:03:44,711 --> 01:03:47,243
Where?
Here, me.

740
01:03:47,501 --> 01:03:48,703
We get a fake baby.

741
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,164
Good thinking Irene.

742
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:52,437
You guys work it out.

743
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,877
I got a terrific dinner almost ready.
Just a couple of minutes.

744
01:03:57,526 --> 01:04:00,408
Pop, what's the matter with you?

745
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:03,964
I didn't get married so
my wife could go on working.

746
01:04:04,148 --> 01:04:06,080
Charley, she's right
and you know it.

747
01:04:06,295 --> 01:04:09,820
Throwing the baby.
Well that's strictly a masterpiece.

748
01:04:10,035 --> 01:04:14,143
The Prizzi's ever found out
I used my own wife on this job...

749
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:15,891
I couldn't hold my head up.

750
01:04:16,044 --> 01:04:20,949
I'd be the laughing stock of every
family in Brooklyn and New York.

751
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:22,850
Who's gonna know Charley?

752
01:04:23,034 --> 01:04:27,020
And what's that compared to sixty,
seventy million dollars.

753
01:04:32,538 --> 01:04:34,408
Gentlemen, dinner is served.

754
01:04:54,827 --> 01:04:58,260
- Maerose!
- Coming Poppa!

755
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,827
Jees Mae, you look awful!

756
01:05:51,177 --> 01:05:54,304
My beautiful daughter
has turned into an old woman.

757
01:05:56,481 --> 01:05:58,750
Charley Partanna did this to you.

758
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:02,889
He had a chance to become part
of the Prizzi family.

759
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:05,341
He had no use for you.

760
01:06:05,863 --> 01:06:09,930
Oh, he had a use for me Poppa.

761
01:06:11,657 --> 01:06:17,188
He came to my place in New York the night
before he married that woman in California.

762
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:21,067
And he forced himself on me.

763
01:06:21,869 --> 01:06:24,236
And he did it to me.

764
01:06:25,484 --> 01:06:28,427
- He did it to you?
- Yeah, Poppa.

765
01:06:28,642 --> 01:06:32,382
Screwed me three times, maybe four.
I can't remember.

766
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:35,237
You whore.
Shut your filthy mouth you here.

767
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:38,115
How can you say such things
to your own father.

768
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:42,990
He done that to you, Charley?

769
01:06:43,144 --> 01:06:45,592
- You sure?
- Am I sure, Poppa.

770
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:48,141
You should see the size of him.

771
01:06:48,294 --> 01:06:49,766
- You should.
- Shut up.

772
01:06:49,919 --> 01:06:52,188
How can you say such things
to your father?

773
01:06:52,525 --> 01:06:53,782
Where's your honour?

774
01:06:53,935 --> 01:06:58,687
Are you kidding Poppa?
I have no honour anymore.

775
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:36,121
Here Poppa.

776
01:08:12,973 --> 01:08:14,891
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

777
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:19,350
Do you mind?

778
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:31,894
Catch!

779
01:08:40,688 --> 01:08:42,589
I must have the wrong floor.

780
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:45,195
Oh my God!

781
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:58,225
No blood I think.

782
01:08:58,348 --> 01:09:00,586
Ok, come on!
Lets move them!

783
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,818
I had to hit her Charley,
she was looking straight at me.

784
01:09:13,002 --> 01:09:15,945
You done right, really.

785
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,838
I can't get over it.

786
01:09:34,923 --> 01:09:37,836
I mean what kind of creep
wouldn't catch a baby.

787
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:41,258
If it was real,
it could have been crippled for life.

788
01:09:42,005 --> 01:09:45,500
He wasn't
the bodyguard of the baby.

789
01:09:48,526 --> 01:09:51,540
When the Don gets what he wants
and when I ask him for some time...

790
01:09:51,693 --> 01:09:54,912
we're gonna go to the old country
have a real honeymoon.

791
01:09:55,074 --> 01:09:57,304
Maybe even a real baby.

792
01:09:57,427 --> 01:10:00,094
Oh, God Charley,
I love you.

793
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,892
What do you want?

794
01:10:22,045 --> 01:10:23,645
Come on!

795
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:37,375
- See you at dinner.
- Ok, dear.

796
01:11:12,294 --> 01:11:15,816
Recapping our top stories at this hour, there
are new developments in this mysterious...

797
01:11:15,924 --> 01:11:18,604
- Come on Charley.
- Shut up, I wanna hear this.

798
01:11:18,777 --> 01:11:21,024
Police have now identified
both victims.

799
01:11:21,197 --> 01:11:23,266
One of whom was
a police captains wife.

800
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:24,747
Shit!

801
01:11:25,173 --> 01:11:26,689
The man found with her
was the bodyguard...

802
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:28,911
of the bank President
Robert Finlay.

803
01:11:29,062 --> 01:11:30,775
Finlay's apartment is right
next door...

804
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:33,384
to the one where
the two bodies were found.

805
01:11:33,513 --> 01:11:35,004
Bank officers
reported him missing...

806
01:11:35,126 --> 01:11:37,597
when he didn't show up
at a meeting on Monday morning.

807
01:11:37,749 --> 01:11:40,449
Police now speculate
he has been kidnapped.

808
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:44,317
They also believe
that Victoria Calhain...

809
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:46,975
stumbled accidentally into
the scene of the crime...

810
01:11:47,256 --> 01:11:48,256
and the kidnappers...

811
01:11:48,358 --> 01:11:51,750
Look at this.
First she gotta push the wrong button.

812
01:11:51,858 --> 01:11:55,921
Then the broad turns out to be
a cops wife.

813
01:11:57,044 --> 01:11:58,420
Call's still waiting Charley.

814
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,242
Yeah?

815
01:12:12,342 --> 01:12:13,293
Hi, darling!

816
01:12:14,633 --> 01:12:16,704
Were you watching the TV just now?

817
01:12:16,804 --> 01:12:20,658
Yeah, a police captains wife.
I couldn't believe my luck.

818
01:12:20,846 --> 01:12:23,755
All hell is gonna break out
over this, Irene.

819
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:27,230
Cops don't like it much
when we hit one of their wives.

820
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:29,024
But it was an accident.

821
01:12:52,987 --> 01:12:54,305
Mr. Ciglione?

822
01:13:02,884 --> 01:13:04,421
Mr. Ciglione.

823
01:13:12,045 --> 01:13:15,503
Mrs. Prizzi would you like to
come to my office please?

824
01:13:15,693 --> 01:13:18,873
Mrs. Prizzi,
would you care for a drink?

825
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:21,380
I'll have a Babycham.

826
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:22,814
Babycham?

827
01:13:22,914 --> 01:13:25,377
You heard what the lady said.
A Babycham!

828
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:26,615
Okay!

829
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,418
Would you please sit down
Mrs. Prizzi?

830
01:13:29,677 --> 01:13:31,448
I think I got something for you.

831
01:13:31,918 --> 01:13:32,940
Capulla!

832
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:37,370
Come on!

833
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:39,984
Sit down over there.

834
01:13:50,572 --> 01:13:51,641
That the broad?

835
01:13:52,735 --> 01:13:53,757
Tell the lady.

836
01:13:54,591 --> 01:13:58,429
I was using this camper as
a trick room in the parking lot.

837
01:13:58,611 --> 01:14:02,276
As I lifted up my head from the job.
I saw this woman in hot pants...

838
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,044
running to the lights of the car where
Louis Paulo caught it in the head.

839
01:14:06,497 --> 01:14:09,133
She's in the car a couple minutes.

840
01:14:09,328 --> 01:14:12,067
Then she gets out
and goes to the trunk...

841
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:15,081
takes out a satchel
and then she fades.

842
01:14:15,724 --> 01:14:16,891
The same woman?

843
01:14:18,771 --> 01:14:20,694
Yeah it's the same one.

844
01:14:38,865 --> 01:14:41,545
Why don't you go on one
of those cruises, honey?

845
01:14:50,534 --> 01:14:54,834
You've reached the answering
machine for 5554375.

846
01:14:55,029 --> 01:14:56,828
Nobody can take your call
right now.

847
01:14:56,928 --> 01:14:58,508
Please leave a message
after the beep.

848
01:15:00,474 --> 01:15:05,617
Meet me on the promenade,
Brooklyn 7pm tomorrow.

849
01:15:05,811 --> 01:15:07,021
Full price.

850
01:15:07,432 --> 01:15:11,407
I'll be on a bench at the end
reading "Popular mechanics".

851
01:15:56,417 --> 01:15:58,318
Are you the contractor?

852
01:16:02,241 --> 01:16:03,526
How much?

853
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,859
It depends.

854
01:16:06,572 --> 01:16:08,971
Some hits are tricky.
Who is it?

855
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,950
A Brooklyn fellow,
Charley Partanna.

856
01:16:12,127 --> 01:16:13,573
Charley Partanna?

857
01:16:29,326 --> 01:16:32,718
Amalia told me that
you wanna thank me...

858
01:16:32,848 --> 01:16:35,592
for bringing you home?

859
01:16:35,786 --> 01:16:40,605
Well,
you are blood of my blood!

860
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,263
You're flesh of my flesh!

861
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,087
And as long as I'm able...

862
01:16:47,282 --> 01:16:49,896
I'm gonna think about
your well being.

863
01:16:50,069 --> 01:16:51,698
Thank you, grandfather.

864
01:16:52,338 --> 01:16:55,039
You have drawn me back
from purgatory.

865
01:16:57,762 --> 01:17:00,700
I wish you had been a son.

866
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:03,401
You are a true Prizzi.

867
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:06,491
Hey, you like to have a cookie?

868
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:13,427
It is I who must offer you a gift
grandfather.

869
01:17:13,989 --> 01:17:15,610
A gesture of my gratitude.

870
01:17:15,804 --> 01:17:19,089
I have always enjoyed gifts.

871
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:33,782
Who's this handsome lady?

872
01:17:34,409 --> 01:17:38,341
That is Charley Partanna's wife,
grandfather.

873
01:17:44,716 --> 01:17:45,716
Well?

874
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,105
My gift to you is not only
the pictures...

875
01:17:52,488 --> 01:17:54,437
but also what they mean.

876
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:58,397
Louis Palo was killed
in the parking lot in Las Vegas.

877
01:17:58,588 --> 01:17:59,539
I know.

878
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:01,656
I took these pictures there.

879
01:18:03,363 --> 01:18:06,453
There was a woman who had been
turning tricks in a camper...

880
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:08,139
in the parking lot.

881
01:18:08,592 --> 01:18:11,056
She told me she saw this woman...

882
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:12,664
get into a car with Palo.

883
01:18:13,173 --> 01:18:16,609
After a minute she got out,
went to the trunk...

884
01:18:16,887 --> 01:18:18,670
and took out a satchel.

885
01:18:20,516 --> 01:18:22,508
This woman?

886
01:18:22,659 --> 01:18:24,625
Yes, grandfather.

887
01:18:27,413 --> 01:18:29,033
She killed Palo...

888
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:33,506
and she stole 720.000
dollars from us.

889
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,720
She gave back half to save herself.

890
01:18:39,665 --> 01:18:42,344
What do you want me to do?

891
01:18:44,008 --> 01:18:45,369
She dishonoured us!

892
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,027
You're like me.

893
01:18:48,169 --> 01:18:50,495
We forgive nothing.

894
01:18:55,763 --> 01:19:00,171
What would that do
to Charley Partanna?

895
01:19:00,765 --> 01:19:03,844
She must pay
like anybody else.

896
01:19:04,102 --> 01:19:05,840
Oh. What you ask...

897
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:10,370
that would cause Charley
great pain.

898
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:13,935
What is that compared to
the honour of the Prizzi's?

899
01:19:14,302 --> 01:19:18,127
Charley is like my son.

900
01:19:18,602 --> 01:19:23,319
I pledged to be his second father
on the day that he was born.

901
01:19:24,242 --> 01:19:25,822
- Grandfather.
- Shut up.

902
01:19:28,779 --> 01:19:30,854
Have another cookie my dear.

903
01:19:41,398 --> 01:19:44,964
We're here to tell you what we're
telling all the families in this town.

904
01:19:45,227 --> 01:19:46,718
All contracts are off...

905
01:19:46,854 --> 01:19:49,304
until we get who ever killed
Captain Calhain's wife.

906
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:52,182
How do you mean Davey?

907
01:19:52,505 --> 01:19:56,812
It means nothing is happening.
We're coming down hard on you.

908
01:19:57,406 --> 01:19:59,804
A police captains' wife
has been murdered.

909
01:20:00,975 --> 01:20:02,661
You got narcotics right?

910
01:20:02,834 --> 01:20:04,281
Plus loan sharking.

911
01:20:04,519 --> 01:20:08,323
Plus horse books, football,
basketball and boxing.

912
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:11,757
Not to mention what you take out of
restaurants in the trucking business.

913
01:20:12,168 --> 01:20:14,285
Plus a couple of millions
in TV sets...

914
01:20:14,437 --> 01:20:16,727
that fall of the back of a truck
every week.

915
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,377
We're gonna put them all out of
business, as of now.

916
01:20:22,086 --> 01:20:24,003
It'll cost us hundreds of thousands...

917
01:20:24,103 --> 01:20:26,148
but that the way it's gonna be.

918
01:20:26,852 --> 01:20:30,300
I've been doing business with
the Police commissioners squad.

919
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,847
For over 40 years now.

920
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:34,143
We always went under one rule:

921
01:20:34,273 --> 01:20:36,174
You take our money,
you leave us alone.

922
01:20:37,822 --> 01:20:41,398
The more pressure you put on us
the more money you cost yourselves.

923
01:20:42,743 --> 01:20:43,939
There ain't a cop on the squad...

924
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:47,238
who's had to get by on straight
police pay for a long time.

925
01:20:47,832 --> 01:20:48,832
Yeah.

926
01:20:50,047 --> 01:20:53,958
Look Angelo, our people don't like
this any better than you do.

927
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:56,421
But this one's a
point of honour with us.

928
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,236
Do you understand that Angelo?

929
01:21:24,703 --> 01:21:27,299
You're a fine looking woman.

930
01:21:28,315 --> 01:21:31,145
Charley Partanna is a lucky man.

931
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:34,786
Thank you for coming.

932
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:39,702
What a surprise you gave us
with this sudden wedding.

933
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:43,354
Well, we just sort of swept
each other away.

934
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:47,308
I understand,
I was young once.

935
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:49,749
This...

936
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:54,430
marriage of yours
has troubled me.

937
01:21:56,151 --> 01:21:57,874
Why Don Corrado?

938
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,346
The people at Prizzi's place
in Vegas...

939
01:22:01,446 --> 01:22:03,571
have looked at pictures of you.

940
01:22:03,671 --> 01:22:07,079
They've told us that
you killed Louis Palo.

941
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:15,139
Now, under ordinary
circumstances...

942
01:22:15,376 --> 01:22:17,710
you would have to be punished...

943
01:22:17,991 --> 01:22:21,794
cause those who steal must pay.

944
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:25,511
You're the wife of my God son.

945
01:22:26,591 --> 01:22:31,993
I've searched to find some way
to show you clemency.

946
01:22:33,314 --> 01:22:34,651
What can I do?

947
01:22:35,018 --> 01:22:39,210
Well you got the other half of
the 720.000 dollars?

948
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:40,529
Yes.

949
01:22:41,349 --> 01:22:42,732
Was Charley in this with you?

950
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,840
No.

951
01:22:44,828 --> 01:22:47,831
He believed me when I told him
the half was Marxie's split.

952
01:22:48,026 --> 01:22:51,310
He didn't know that I had anything
to do with it or that I killed Louis.

953
01:22:51,483 --> 01:22:52,483
Good.

954
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:56,660
Now you have five days...

955
01:22:58,138 --> 01:23:03,108
to get the 360.000 together,
then you will give it back...

956
01:23:04,297 --> 01:23:06,890
together with
a 50 percent penalty...

957
01:23:07,019 --> 01:23:09,298
for what you have done to us.

958
01:23:10,282 --> 01:23:13,459
Will five days be enough time
for you?

959
01:23:13,938 --> 01:23:14,938
Five days?

960
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:18,642
Yeah, I can get it together
in five days.

961
01:23:27,953 --> 01:23:29,027
Irene?

962
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:30,615
Charley.

963
01:23:33,186 --> 01:23:34,893
How come you're in L. A?

964
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:37,577
I had business to attend to,
didn't you see my note?

965
01:23:38,243 --> 01:23:40,360
Can you get out here this weekend?

966
01:23:41,354 --> 01:23:43,018
I don't think so.

967
01:23:47,102 --> 01:23:48,202
Tell me.

968
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,494
Tell you what.

969
01:23:51,035 --> 01:23:52,634
Tell me I love you.

970
01:23:54,903 --> 01:23:56,012
I love you.

971
01:23:56,501 --> 01:23:59,699
Love you too, and it's real.

972
01:23:59,894 --> 01:24:03,221
May not be scientific, but it's real.

973
01:24:03,589 --> 01:24:04,886
Scientific?

974
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,734
I read it in a magazine.
According to a doctor...

975
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:11,713
everyone is trying to get...

976
01:24:11,821 --> 01:24:14,781
what they thought
they needed from their mothers...

977
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:16,366
but they didn't get it.

978
01:24:18,109 --> 01:24:20,620
I don't even remember my mother.

979
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:23,237
That's the amazing part.

980
01:24:23,511 --> 01:24:26,385
There's something in you
that knows anyways.

981
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:28,438
The magazine said so.

982
01:24:29,173 --> 01:24:31,225
That's what love is.

983
01:24:31,476 --> 01:24:35,050
When you find someone
who'll give you...

984
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:38,637
what you think you wanted
when you were a baby...

985
01:24:38,918 --> 01:24:40,193
but you didn't get it.

986
01:24:40,322 --> 01:24:42,116
A doctor wrote this.

987
01:24:42,872 --> 01:24:45,163
Charley forget doctors.

988
01:24:46,282 --> 01:24:49,419
Better yet,
lets play doctor.

989
01:24:51,472 --> 01:24:52,898
On the phone?

990
01:24:56,874 --> 01:25:01,347
Doctor Partanna
I have this itch...

991
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:03,090
Well?

992
01:25:55,842 --> 01:25:57,886
They're not kidding around
this time.

993
01:25:59,278 --> 01:26:00,889
It's gonna get worse.

994
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:04,528
They're gonna keep leaning on us...

995
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:07,229
until we give them whoever it was...

996
01:26:07,364 --> 01:26:08,677
that hit that Cops wife.

997
01:26:10,276 --> 01:26:12,091
All I know is that...

998
01:26:13,215 --> 01:26:14,555
the cops tell us...

999
01:26:14,749 --> 01:26:19,243
the guy who got snatched the day
they did the number on the cops wife...

1000
01:26:21,015 --> 01:26:25,706
was in big business
with the Prizzi family.

1001
01:26:29,615 --> 01:26:31,538
I wanna make this a short meet.

1002
01:26:32,122 --> 01:26:34,423
I wanna put it to a vote right now...

1003
01:26:35,946 --> 01:26:37,696
that Dominic Prizzi...

1004
01:26:39,252 --> 01:26:41,629
tells us what the hell
he's gonna do about it.

1005
01:26:42,796 --> 01:26:43,984
Alright?

1006
01:26:44,848 --> 01:26:46,226
Raise your hands.

1007
01:26:48,365 --> 01:26:50,294
Hold the hands.

1008
01:26:52,843 --> 01:26:55,236
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1009
01:26:56,798 --> 01:26:58,829
I am Dominic Prizzi.

1010
01:27:00,169 --> 01:27:04,555
When most of you people was walking
around with holes in your pants...

1011
01:27:04,901 --> 01:27:06,915
I was holding up gas stations.

1012
01:27:07,926 --> 01:27:10,497
We was the biggest family
in the country.

1013
01:27:11,707 --> 01:27:16,090
And now most of you have figured out
how to push broads...

1014
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:18,551
we're still the biggest.

1015
01:27:19,508 --> 01:27:22,576
We lose more when the cops
get in an uproar...

1016
01:27:22,749 --> 01:27:24,024
than any of you.

1017
01:27:24,609 --> 01:27:26,559
Now we don't like it...

1018
01:27:27,805 --> 01:27:31,349
but you ain't gonna tell us
how to run our business.

1019
01:27:33,812 --> 01:27:37,291
We ain't taking any shit
from any outsiders...

1020
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:39,582
about the family business...

1021
01:27:40,943 --> 01:27:49,067
especially from a scummy little pimp
like you, Señor Bocca.

1022
01:28:04,258 --> 01:28:07,175
I hope you like it!

1023
01:28:10,782 --> 01:28:12,147
Thank you.

1024
01:28:18,372 --> 01:28:22,560
Padrino, you never saw anything
like this here...

1025
01:28:23,618 --> 01:28:27,033
the broad pushes the wrong button
on the elevator.

1026
01:28:27,256 --> 01:28:29,993
The door drops just in the minute...

1027
01:28:30,144 --> 01:28:32,348
when the second man drops
the bodyguard.

1028
01:28:32,499 --> 01:28:34,420
The woman is standing there.

1029
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:36,886
She makes all three of us.

1030
01:28:37,858 --> 01:28:40,658
She had to go.

1031
01:28:40,978 --> 01:28:43,973
I'm sure you didn't act
without thinking.

1032
01:28:44,837 --> 01:28:48,122
That's why I called you here today.

1033
01:28:48,251 --> 01:28:49,721
You're a thinker.

1034
01:28:54,129 --> 01:28:56,817
Dominic is a sick man...

1035
01:28:58,204 --> 01:29:01,195
and the return of
his daughter brought him no ease.

1036
01:29:01,389 --> 01:29:03,240
He has got older.

1037
01:29:03,398 --> 01:29:05,776
I'm gonna move Dominic out
to Vegas...

1038
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:08,995
and make you boss.

1039
01:29:18,956 --> 01:29:21,441
I'm speechless Padrino.

1040
01:29:28,507 --> 01:29:29,825
This...

1041
01:29:30,214 --> 01:29:32,020
is an honour...

1042
01:29:34,254 --> 01:29:36,199
beyond my dreams.

1043
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:41,363
What could I do to show
my gratitude?

1044
01:29:41,839 --> 01:29:45,058
For the time being
this must be our secret.

1045
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:47,500
You must not even tell your father.

1046
01:29:52,427 --> 01:29:54,956
I don't understand Padrino.

1047
01:29:55,538 --> 01:30:00,271
We'll announce everything once
the Filargi thing is settled.

1048
01:30:00,476 --> 01:30:06,513
Then Dominic will move out
and you'll move in.

1049
01:30:29,376 --> 01:30:32,769
God, I missed you.

1050
01:30:34,022 --> 01:30:35,793
So I gathered.

1051
01:30:37,976 --> 01:30:39,575
What's been happening?

1052
01:30:42,557 --> 01:30:43,681
Plenty.

1053
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:47,388
Just had a meeting with the Don.

1054
01:30:48,997 --> 01:30:50,725
A private audience.

1055
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:52,460
Here.

1056
01:30:54,766 --> 01:30:56,939
He wants me to take over.

1057
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,498
He says that Dominic is sick.

1058
01:30:59,714 --> 01:31:01,569
They're gonna send him to Vegas.

1059
01:31:01,788 --> 01:31:03,164
I'm gonna be the boss.

1060
01:31:03,264 --> 01:31:05,094
Charley,
that's fantastic.

1061
01:31:05,397 --> 01:31:06,888
I don't know.

1062
01:31:07,514 --> 01:31:09,718
Sounds fishy to me.

1063
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:13,716
Number one...

1064
01:31:15,099 --> 01:31:18,059
should have been Dominic
told me...

1065
01:31:18,297 --> 01:31:19,615
instead of the Don.

1066
01:31:19,723 --> 01:31:22,575
Well maybe the Don hasn't broken
the news to Dominic yet?

1067
01:31:24,023 --> 01:31:26,140
Whether he has or he hasn't...

1068
01:31:26,551 --> 01:31:28,387
he would have told Pop.

1069
01:31:29,576 --> 01:31:34,071
He don't decide what Mass to go to
unless he talks to Pop.

1070
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:39,814
Big deal like this they'd go over
every angle fifteen times.

1071
01:31:39,914 --> 01:31:40,985
They didn't?

1072
01:31:41,179 --> 01:31:42,105
No.

1073
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:44,112
And worse than that.

1074
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:48,180
The Don says for me not to tell Pop.

1075
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:51,422
Wanna know what I think, Irene?

1076
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:52,660
What?

1077
01:31:56,824 --> 01:31:59,179
I think they're setting me up.

1078
01:32:05,878 --> 01:32:07,585
I think you're right Charley.

1079
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,983
I think they're after our scalps.

1080
01:32:10,394 --> 01:32:12,140
How do you know?

1081
01:32:13,224 --> 01:32:15,102
I gotta a couple of things to tell you.

1082
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,123
I went out to L. A on orders
of the Don.

1083
01:32:19,447 --> 01:32:21,567
He told me to bring back the money
I took from Louis Palo...

1084
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:23,445
plus 50 percent interest.

1085
01:32:24,006 --> 01:32:26,420
So you did ice Louis Palo.

1086
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:29,344
You swore to me that you didn't.
You lied to me.

1087
01:32:29,473 --> 01:32:31,201
I lied to you because
you wanted me to.

1088
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:33,579
I only told you what
you wanted to be true.

1089
01:32:33,687 --> 01:32:35,524
And I told the Don
it was all my doing.

1090
01:32:35,632 --> 01:32:38,246
Jesus Charley, I'm so sorry.

1091
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:45,204
What's the other thing you got to tell
me?

1092
01:32:45,571 --> 01:32:47,802
Dominic has put out
a contract on you.

1093
01:32:50,044 --> 01:32:51,881
What are you fucking nuts?

1094
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:54,344
No, Charley,
I'm the contractor.

1095
01:32:56,764 --> 01:32:59,983
Dominic hires my own wife
to clip me?

1096
01:33:00,437 --> 01:33:02,663
Charley he didn't know
I was your wife.

1097
01:33:02,814 --> 01:33:04,448
He just wanted the best.

1098
01:33:06,423 --> 01:33:07,423
Charley!

1099
01:33:07,753 --> 01:33:10,996
Honey,
let's go to Hong Kong tonight.

1100
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:13,186
What are you talking about?

1101
01:33:13,316 --> 01:33:15,714
Let's beat it while we still can.

1102
01:33:15,887 --> 01:33:16,715
Beat it?

1103
01:33:16,815 --> 01:33:19,560
Yeah, scram, split,
let's make a run for it.

1104
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:21,379
Look I know this guy in Hong Kong
who can give us...

1105
01:33:21,479 --> 01:33:23,940
new prints even new faces
in a few days.

1106
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,950
We can get out of this crazy world,
we can start fresh.

1107
01:33:27,123 --> 01:33:29,284
We can be together all the time.

1108
01:33:29,734 --> 01:33:30,661
Hong Kong?

1109
01:33:30,761 --> 01:33:32,352
Hong Kong, Brazil, South Africa.

1110
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:35,680
It doesn't matter.
What matters is us together.

1111
01:33:36,699 --> 01:33:40,758
Listen, I've been doing three four
hits a year for the last few years.

1112
01:33:40,866 --> 01:33:42,486
Most of them full pay.

1113
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:45,598
That many?

1114
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:49,487
Well it's not many if you consider
the size of the population.

1115
01:33:50,071 --> 01:33:53,665
The thing is
I got almost a million.

1116
01:33:53,895 --> 01:33:56,417
In a safe deposit box on the coast.

1117
01:33:56,553 --> 01:33:58,469
You must have at least
that much put away.

1118
01:33:58,569 --> 01:34:00,293
We can take all the money
and make a run for it.

1119
01:34:00,393 --> 01:34:02,208
We can go where we want,
do what we want...

1120
01:34:02,308 --> 01:34:04,259
we can be together
all the time.

1121
01:34:04,394 --> 01:34:07,011
Please Charley let's just go
before they get us.

1122
01:34:07,147 --> 01:34:09,561
They're not gonna get us.

1123
01:34:09,993 --> 01:34:12,089
Piss on the Prizzi's.

1124
01:34:12,486 --> 01:34:14,751
These people can't win all the time.

1125
01:34:14,851 --> 01:34:17,967
There has to be a way to beat them.
Bastards.

1126
01:34:22,785 --> 01:34:24,579
Let's call Pop.

1127
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:30,827
And the Don told you to keep
making you boss a secret from me?

1128
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:32,004
Yeah.

1129
01:34:33,135 --> 01:34:37,219
And he told you he's letting you off
for giving him back the money?

1130
01:34:37,386 --> 01:34:39,682
Plus fifty percent.

1131
01:34:40,461 --> 01:34:44,134
And Dominic gave you a fifty dollar
down payment to hit Charley?

1132
01:34:44,328 --> 01:34:46,640
Absolutely.
Brand new bills.

1133
01:34:58,093 --> 01:34:59,886
Oh, he's hot.

1134
01:35:00,409 --> 01:35:02,358
I ain't never seen him this hot.

1135
01:35:21,364 --> 01:35:24,965
It's just business, just business.

1136
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:27,343
What are we gonna do?

1137
01:35:27,478 --> 01:35:30,304
We have to take away the only thing
the Don wants,

1138
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,040
Filargi.

1139
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:36,602
You have to snatch Filargi again
This time from the Prizzi's.

1140
01:35:36,738 --> 01:35:39,104
How many people you got out there
holding him down?

1141
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,152
Two.

1142
01:35:40,252 --> 01:35:42,173
My people,
they do whatever I tell them.

1143
01:35:42,367 --> 01:35:43,293
Good.

1144
01:35:43,393 --> 01:35:47,574
Filargi is worth seventy million,
maybe more to the Prizzi's.

1145
01:35:47,957 --> 01:35:49,584
Including the bank.

1146
01:35:50,557 --> 01:35:53,160
So what are you next to
seventy million dollars?

1147
01:35:53,365 --> 01:35:54,365
Nothing.

1148
01:35:54,856 --> 01:35:56,499
They'll take whatever deal
you offer them.

1149
01:35:56,628 --> 01:35:57,988
Yeah, no choice right.

1150
01:35:58,134 --> 01:36:02,586
They know we can let Filargi
go and testify against them.

1151
01:36:02,805 --> 01:36:04,421
Or even worse...

1152
01:36:05,574 --> 01:36:06,532
you can try and go into...

1153
01:36:06,632 --> 01:36:08,873
the Governments
witness protection programme...

1154
01:36:08,973 --> 01:36:11,840
and testify against
the Don and Dominic.

1155
01:36:12,186 --> 01:36:15,701
To a jury the colds facts would be
you shot the Captains wife...

1156
01:36:15,801 --> 01:36:19,965
on orders from the Don and Dominic
after they hired you for 150 dollars.

1157
01:36:21,326 --> 01:36:24,359
You're very dangerous to the Prizzi's,
Irene.

1158
01:36:24,745 --> 01:36:25,745
Yeah.

1159
01:36:26,577 --> 01:36:30,282
It could turn out to be a good thing
Irene zipped the police captains wife.

1160
01:36:30,751 --> 01:36:32,692
It could solve all our problems.

1161
01:37:30,903 --> 01:37:34,966
We're here tonight to honour
my son.

1162
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,558
He's gonna leave us...

1163
01:37:37,991 --> 01:37:41,851
to live in a 935.000 dollar
house...

1164
01:37:41,951 --> 01:37:47,153
next to his own golf course
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1165
01:37:49,076 --> 01:37:53,866
And I said to him,
from you, from my heart...

1166
01:37:54,759 --> 01:37:56,577
God speed you!

1167
01:37:58,497 --> 01:38:00,701
God bless you Dominic!

1168
01:38:05,476 --> 01:38:07,421
And I want to present you...

1169
01:38:07,659 --> 01:38:12,888
with these tokens of esteem
from your entire family.

1170
01:38:13,752 --> 01:38:16,583
Some going away presents.

1171
01:38:22,503 --> 01:38:25,788
A complete set of
Stealing silver golf clubs.

1172
01:38:28,489 --> 01:38:31,535
That bag is made out of the hide
of an elephant.

1173
01:38:31,706 --> 01:38:34,073
It's the only one
in the United States.

1174
01:38:34,834 --> 01:38:39,246
And one thousand of your favourite
Mexican cigars.

1175
01:38:40,784 --> 01:38:45,646
We're gonna have a song in celebration
of this grand occasion...

1176
01:38:45,797 --> 01:38:49,124
the great Tenor
Tomas Innovarata.

1177
01:39:39,449 --> 01:39:40,755
Get moving.

1178
01:39:45,067 --> 01:39:48,316
Holy shit boss.
Somebody done the job on Fingo.

1179
01:40:39,544 --> 01:40:41,766
The Bocca's.

1180
01:40:42,652 --> 01:40:48,702
This killing of the Police captain's
wife is costing us all too much.

1181
01:40:56,728 --> 01:40:58,707
I got something to read to you.

1182
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:01,646
It's a letter.

1183
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:04,627
A letter?
Who from?

1184
01:41:06,594 --> 01:41:07,674
Charley.

1185
01:41:10,527 --> 01:41:11,715
You all set?

1186
01:41:16,036 --> 01:41:17,268
Dear Eduardo...

1187
01:41:17,808 --> 01:41:20,488
You're probably hot right now
cause we took Filargi.

1188
01:41:21,331 --> 01:41:23,275
But when you hear
the reason why...

1189
01:41:23,448 --> 01:41:26,581
you and the Don are gonna understand
there was no other way we could go.

1190
01:41:27,899 --> 01:41:31,335
Dominic put out a contract on me.

1191
01:41:35,977 --> 01:41:37,249
He's a fucking liar!

1192
01:41:37,395 --> 01:41:40,021
You wanna hear the letter,
listen don't talk.

1193
01:41:40,129 --> 01:41:42,571
There's a 130 million dollars here
maybe more.

1194
01:41:42,692 --> 01:41:44,689
We've gotta renegotiate it
before we get it back.

1195
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:47,886
Just shut up and listen.
Go on, sit down.

1196
01:41:48,614 --> 01:41:49,637
Go on.

1197
01:41:53,578 --> 01:41:55,817
Dominic will say
it's a lot of bullshit.

1198
01:41:58,798 --> 01:42:00,564
It so happens
he hired my own wife...

1199
01:42:00,664 --> 01:42:03,898
and gave her a down payment
of 50,000 dollars.

1200
01:42:04,395 --> 01:42:07,852
And my wife is sitting right next
to me and she's laughing like hell.

1201
01:42:08,911 --> 01:42:12,303
I personally think the Don found
Dominic on a doorstep...

1202
01:42:12,455 --> 01:42:15,841
because he's too dumb
to be a Prizzi.

1203
01:42:23,734 --> 01:42:27,451
The first thing I gotta have
before you get Filargi back...

1204
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:30,735
is that you deliver
Dominic to me...

1205
01:42:31,275 --> 01:42:33,803
where I tell you
and when I tell you.

1206
01:42:33,955 --> 01:42:37,239
This time no contract,
I'll kill him myself.

1207
01:42:37,433 --> 01:42:39,248
Listen to the letter will ya' Dominic?

1208
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,583
Come on.

1209
01:42:47,762 --> 01:42:50,074
For the main money
this is what I want.

1210
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:54,963
23,014 dollars for expenses.

1211
01:42:55,933 --> 01:42:58,175
Then 50 dollars for my helper.

1212
01:42:59,603 --> 01:43:02,103
Of course the 150 dollars
that was promised my wife...

1213
01:43:02,203 --> 01:43:04,854
as second man in the Filargi scam.

1214
01:43:05,956 --> 01:43:07,966
Charley's wife was the second man?

1215
01:43:08,138 --> 01:43:10,991
She was the only way
we could take out the bodyguard.

1216
01:43:11,698 --> 01:43:15,420
Then I want all the insurance coverage
on Filargi's kidnap policy...

1217
01:43:15,528 --> 01:43:16,528
which is two million five.

1218
01:43:16,662 --> 01:43:20,088
- My God he's a real businessman.
- That's my boy.

1219
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:23,415
We gotta make him an offer and
eventually we settle.

1220
01:43:23,912 --> 01:43:28,028
The way I see it, we get about
60 or 70 million dollars...

1221
01:43:28,133 --> 01:43:29,996
with about 5.9% sales costs...

1222
01:43:30,096 --> 01:43:32,814
if we give Charley everything he wants,
which we obviously won't.

1223
01:43:32,966 --> 01:43:36,214
And I am part of
the fucking sales cost.

1224
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:38,000
Dominic...

1225
01:43:38,389 --> 01:43:40,982
take some blood pressure medicine,
will ya?

1226
01:43:41,306 --> 01:43:43,262
Charley is just making a point.

1227
01:43:43,618 --> 01:43:45,431
Everything is negotiable.

1228
01:43:46,943 --> 01:43:48,726
We go over to Poppa's...

1229
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,527
we hash this thing out.

1230
01:43:53,083 --> 01:43:55,589
Come on!
Let's go!

1231
01:45:32,695 --> 01:45:35,072
- Somebody is dead?
- Yes,

1232
01:45:35,267 --> 01:45:37,363
Who?
Who's dead?

1233
01:45:38,443 --> 01:45:39,947
Poppa...

1234
01:45:41,576 --> 01:45:42,872
Dominic.

1235
01:45:48,024 --> 01:45:50,759
The Bocca's again.

1236
01:45:56,961 --> 01:45:59,161
Oh Dominic!

1237
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,465
He got old!

1238
01:46:07,586 --> 01:46:10,639
Maybe it was his daughter,
who knows.

1239
01:46:13,167 --> 01:46:15,889
I agreed to retire him...

1240
01:46:16,136 --> 01:46:19,152
and I gave his job to Charley.

1241
01:46:21,313 --> 01:46:24,317
I told him to keep this secret
a little while...

1242
01:46:25,094 --> 01:46:26,347
until...

1243
01:46:26,931 --> 01:46:29,848
Dominic's banquet.

1244
01:46:31,166 --> 01:46:33,521
Now Charley is all mixed up...

1245
01:46:33,629 --> 01:46:35,520
and we gotta get him back.

1246
01:46:36,049 --> 01:46:39,550
Only Charley can hold everything
together here.

1247
01:46:57,139 --> 01:46:58,543
How you doing Pop?

1248
01:46:58,954 --> 01:47:00,848
Fine, everything alright?

1249
01:47:01,099 --> 01:47:03,988
Yeah, everything's quiet out here.

1250
01:47:04,097 --> 01:47:05,501
That's better huh.

1251
01:47:07,489 --> 01:47:09,347
Sorry to drag you out here...

1252
01:47:09,455 --> 01:47:12,264
but I didn't want anyone
taking a pot shot at me.

1253
01:47:13,021 --> 01:47:15,715
When I told the Don about Dominic
putting out contract on you...

1254
01:47:15,815 --> 01:47:16,824
it knocked him out.

1255
01:47:16,932 --> 01:47:18,228
He couldn't believe it.

1256
01:47:18,898 --> 01:47:21,984
He told me with tears in his eyes
that he gotta straighten all this out.

1257
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:27,281
He wasn't setting me up?

1258
01:47:28,209 --> 01:47:29,227
He said...

1259
01:47:29,502 --> 01:47:33,037
and I've known him for fifty years,
so it's like looking through his heart.

1260
01:47:33,592 --> 01:47:36,422
He said:
"We need Charley".

1261
01:47:37,632 --> 01:47:39,469
Oh, he said that?

1262
01:47:40,744 --> 01:47:43,056
The Don and me
don't have much time left.

1263
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:44,979
The family has to keep going.

1264
01:47:45,393 --> 01:47:47,343
You're the only one that can run it.

1265
01:47:50,143 --> 01:47:51,805
Then everything is ok.

1266
01:47:51,941 --> 01:47:54,249
We don't have to hang on to Filargi.

1267
01:47:54,594 --> 01:47:56,852
The Don gave me his guarantee.

1268
01:47:59,305 --> 01:48:01,854
Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock,
you bring Filargi...

1269
01:48:01,954 --> 01:48:04,319
at 42nd Street library
and let him out.

1270
01:48:04,836 --> 01:48:08,229
I'll tip off the cops and the FBI.
They'll be in his hotel room.

1271
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:11,284
Ok Pop, want the paper?

1272
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:13,220
Na, read it from cover to cover.

1273
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,640
Jupiter was 6 at Vermont.

1274
01:48:15,748 --> 01:48:16,748
Ok.

1275
01:48:17,434 --> 01:48:20,481
By the way,
the insurance company paid off.

1276
01:48:21,764 --> 01:48:23,380
Take care of yourself Charley.

1277
01:48:37,237 --> 01:48:38,895
How are we gonna take Filargi in?

1278
01:48:40,231 --> 01:48:43,731
Pop's sending someone up on
the Palace to meet us.

1279
01:48:44,963 --> 01:48:48,377
We'll transfer him into the van
and I'll drive him into the city.

1280
01:48:48,528 --> 01:48:50,240
You stick with the plumber.

1281
01:48:50,375 --> 01:48:52,742
He'll drop you off at the apartment.

1282
01:48:54,621 --> 01:48:56,285
Tell me about the money Charley.

1283
01:48:58,727 --> 01:49:00,625
My end is 2,5 million...

1284
01:49:00,761 --> 01:49:02,583
plus I'm boss of the Prizzi's...

1285
01:49:02,683 --> 01:49:06,173
with heavy points in everything
the family does.

1286
01:49:08,234 --> 01:49:12,383
This time next week
we'll have all the money.

1287
01:49:12,564 --> 01:49:15,127
You mean to tell me you're gonna
turn over a hole ball of wax...

1288
01:49:15,235 --> 01:49:18,186
to some Sicilians who are gonna pay
you what they owe you next week.

1289
01:49:19,881 --> 01:49:21,739
Honey I'm the boss.
They need me.

1290
01:49:21,908 --> 01:49:24,569
I gotta believe Pop.

1291
01:49:24,669 --> 01:49:26,947
They're not gonna screw us over now.

1292
01:49:27,595 --> 01:49:29,739
Well maybe Pop is in there
looking after your interests...

1293
01:49:29,842 --> 01:49:32,651
but that doesn't necessarily mean
he's looking after mine.

1294
01:49:33,336 --> 01:49:36,000
There is a real pressure to turn over
the second man.

1295
01:49:37,405 --> 01:49:38,723
You're my wife.

1296
01:49:38,853 --> 01:49:40,917
I'm your Polak wife.

1297
01:49:41,402 --> 01:49:44,211
Irene will you shape up, jees.

1298
01:49:44,946 --> 01:49:50,305
Ok, I'll shape up as soon as I get
my 900 dollars.

1299
01:49:52,188 --> 01:49:54,173
What 900 dollars?

1300
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:56,996
The $720 from the Vegas scam...

1301
01:49:57,096 --> 01:49:59,726
plus the $180 that
Don made me pay as penalty.

1302
01:49:59,834 --> 01:50:03,189
That's 900 dollars.
I just want what's mine.

1303
01:50:04,804 --> 01:50:08,542
That's Prizzi money honey, not yours.
You stole.

1304
01:50:08,866 --> 01:50:11,113
The Prizzi's got theirs back
from the insurance company.

1305
01:50:11,243 --> 01:50:12,615
Now I just want it back.

1306
01:50:13,209 --> 01:50:16,202
That ain't gonna make no sense
to the Prizzi's, honey.

1307
01:50:16,731 --> 01:50:20,081
Remember the words of the late,
great Marxie Heller.

1308
01:50:20,426 --> 01:50:23,927
We'd rather eat our children
than part with money.

1309
01:50:24,638 --> 01:50:26,800
Remember those words, honey.

1310
01:50:27,643 --> 01:50:28,897
I am Charley, I am.

1311
01:50:29,783 --> 01:50:30,783
I am.

1312
01:50:40,608 --> 01:50:42,020
Mr Filargi...

1313
01:50:43,491 --> 01:50:45,988
you were born a poor kid
in Naples right?

1314
01:50:46,269 --> 01:50:47,557
Yeah that's right.

1315
01:50:48,662 --> 01:50:50,720
You remember the Camorra?

1316
01:50:52,903 --> 01:50:55,993
The Camorra was small,
we're very big.

1317
01:50:56,533 --> 01:50:58,910
There's no where's we can't go.

1318
01:50:59,673 --> 01:51:01,712
They could lock you
in a steel room...

1319
01:51:01,812 --> 01:51:04,010
in a submarine
at the bottom of the ocean.

1320
01:51:04,161 --> 01:51:05,867
And we'd still get to you.

1321
01:51:07,078 --> 01:51:09,217
The cops are gonna talk to you.

1322
01:51:10,146 --> 01:51:14,035
If you tell them anything about who
took you, or where they took you.

1323
01:51:14,143 --> 01:51:15,512
We're gonna kill you.

1324
01:51:16,088 --> 01:51:17,385
Capiche?

1325
01:51:17,942 --> 01:51:19,391
I understand.

1326
01:51:20,518 --> 01:51:21,518
Good.

1327
01:51:23,824 --> 01:51:26,440
You're free Mr. Filargi,
good luck.

1328
01:51:28,953 --> 01:51:29,953
Yeah.

1329
01:51:34,887 --> 01:51:37,233
I've forgotten the Prizzi's already.

1330
01:51:39,425 --> 01:51:41,758
I got a request to make...

1331
01:51:41,996 --> 01:51:43,789
or Irene has.

1332
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:47,031
What kind of request Charley?

1333
01:51:47,787 --> 01:51:49,818
She wants her money back.

1334
01:51:50,661 --> 01:51:52,260
What money?

1335
01:51:52,692 --> 01:51:56,084
The 540 she gave you for the Don.

1336
01:51:56,192 --> 01:51:59,557
Plus the 360.000 I took the night
I zipped Marxie Heller.

1337
01:51:59,693 --> 01:52:00,693
That money.

1338
01:52:01,529 --> 01:52:02,906
She's willing to forget about...

1339
01:52:03,006 --> 01:52:06,543
2,5 million for Filargi's insurance...

1340
01:52:06,737 --> 01:52:11,210
and the rest of what Dominic
owed her for the contract on me.

1341
01:52:13,414 --> 01:52:16,137
But she wants her 900 back.

1342
01:52:23,959 --> 01:52:25,817
With all the respect Charley...

1343
01:52:26,444 --> 01:52:28,043
your wife must be cracked.

1344
01:52:29,123 --> 01:52:31,506
Try and see it from
her point of view.

1345
01:52:31,997 --> 01:52:35,000
I mean you agreed to all that stuff
in the letter we sent...

1346
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:36,880
when we had Filargi.

1347
01:52:38,285 --> 01:52:40,489
You made a commitment, Pop.

1348
01:52:41,699 --> 01:52:44,808
And anyways,
it was Irene's move...

1349
01:52:44,908 --> 01:52:47,662
that got Filargi out
in the first place.

1350
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:50,018
We're gonna get the bank.

1351
01:52:50,428 --> 01:52:53,302
So, 900 doesn't seem
like so much money

1352
01:52:53,432 --> 01:52:56,046
Irene figures
she got it coming to her.

1353
01:52:58,704 --> 01:53:03,198
I glad that she's so foolish
and grasping.

1354
01:53:03,804 --> 01:53:06,829
Makes it a little easier
what we gotta do.

1355
01:53:10,913 --> 01:53:18,216
The family has decided that we've got
to give the second man to the cops.

1356
01:53:21,889 --> 01:53:24,115
Give Irene to the cops?

1357
01:53:24,612 --> 01:53:26,787
The family decided that...

1358
01:53:26,887 --> 01:53:30,209
we got one week to give up
the second man...

1359
01:53:30,598 --> 01:53:32,499
or we'll be at war.

1360
01:53:33,169 --> 01:53:37,080
War will cost us everything we got.

1361
01:53:37,253 --> 01:53:40,018
And that could mean the end
of the family.

1362
01:53:41,596 --> 01:53:43,540
Well Padrino.

1363
01:53:43,735 --> 01:53:46,155
You should never have married a
woman who wasn't in the environment.

1364
01:53:46,263 --> 01:53:47,516
That wasn't smart.

1365
01:53:47,733 --> 01:53:49,656
Might have been alright
if she was straight.

1366
01:53:49,828 --> 01:53:51,103
But she wasn't.

1367
01:53:56,095 --> 01:53:58,011
She gotta go.

1368
01:53:59,185 --> 01:54:02,210
And you gotta do the job on her,
Charley.

1369
01:54:02,318 --> 01:54:05,667
You're the only one who can get
close enough to do it.

1370
01:54:06,553 --> 01:54:08,282
Zip Irene?

1371
01:54:09,513 --> 01:54:11,090
Clip Irene?

1372
01:54:11,415 --> 01:54:13,684
If they take her alive
they're gonna make her talk.

1373
01:54:13,792 --> 01:54:15,520
And if she talks...

1374
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,372
she's gonna drag us all to jail...

1375
01:54:18,502 --> 01:54:20,209
maybe even to the chair.

1376
01:54:21,117 --> 01:54:24,272
Filargi will go free and
we'll never get the bank.

1377
01:54:24,401 --> 01:54:26,022
There's no choice here.

1378
01:54:30,344 --> 01:54:33,657
How is doing a number on Irene
gonna satisfy the cops...

1379
01:54:33,757 --> 01:54:35,832
about the broad that pushed
the wrong button?

1380
01:54:37,474 --> 01:54:40,375
Filargi will identify
your wife's body...

1381
01:54:40,499 --> 01:54:42,768
and there will be no-one
to question.

1382
01:54:43,568 --> 01:54:44,963
Everybody will get
what they want...

1383
01:54:45,099 --> 01:54:47,759
and we can all go back
to doing business.

1384
01:54:49,769 --> 01:54:51,670
But Padrino...

1385
01:54:52,686 --> 01:54:54,587
she's my wife.

1386
01:54:54,983 --> 01:54:56,618
I can't kill her.

1387
01:54:57,526 --> 01:54:59,102
Now, Charley...

1388
01:55:00,292 --> 01:55:05,240
you swore an oath of blood,
my blood and yours.

1389
01:55:05,348 --> 01:55:10,836
That you would always put the family
before anything else in your life.

1390
01:55:12,371 --> 01:55:14,028
I'm simply calling on you now...

1391
01:55:14,128 --> 01:55:17,427
to keep that sacred oath.

1392
01:55:19,372 --> 01:55:24,233
Irene is my family Padrino.
She's my wife.

1393
01:55:24,385 --> 01:55:28,080
She's a woman you've known
for only a few weeks.

1394
01:55:28,601 --> 01:55:30,154
She is your wife.

1395
01:55:30,543 --> 01:55:32,099
We are your life.

1396
01:55:32,272 --> 01:55:34,151
You're failing your oath...

1397
01:55:35,837 --> 01:55:39,575
when you covered up for her
in the Vegas scam.

1398
01:55:40,872 --> 01:55:45,431
A great sin
against your honour.

1399
01:55:46,828 --> 01:55:49,385
But this for this you must stone.

1400
01:55:49,748 --> 01:55:50,898
I need her.

1401
01:55:54,787 --> 01:55:56,278
Look at you's.

1402
01:55:59,001 --> 01:56:01,313
Pop, you've been alone
since Mamma died.

1403
01:56:03,841 --> 01:56:07,557
Padrino you've been alone
all my life.

1404
01:56:09,545 --> 01:56:13,197
Is that what you want for me,
to grow old like you?

1405
01:56:13,565 --> 01:56:18,513
With nothing but bodyguards and
money to keep me company?

1406
01:56:22,143 --> 01:56:24,606
Charley,
my beloved man.

1407
01:56:26,035 --> 01:56:28,452
You will be even more alone.

1408
01:56:29,538 --> 01:56:33,854
If you turn you back on us,
we are your blood.

1409
01:56:36,901 --> 01:56:40,034
Jees, I feel like I'm drowning
or something.

1410
01:56:41,871 --> 01:56:44,960
We covered up the Vegas scam
to protect her.

1411
01:56:45,177 --> 01:56:47,230
That's what I thought
we did for our women.

1412
01:56:47,338 --> 01:56:49,325
How can that be a sin
against honour?

1413
01:56:50,492 --> 01:56:53,510
She is a hitter and a thief.

1414
01:56:54,021 --> 01:56:56,263
You must give her to us.

1415
01:56:56,802 --> 01:56:58,390
What is your answer?

1416
01:57:32,628 --> 01:57:33,881
The family...

1417
01:57:34,551 --> 01:57:37,706
It's the only place I can be,
I know that.

1418
01:57:54,583 --> 01:57:58,276
It's business Charley, only business.

1419
01:58:20,057 --> 01:58:23,061
Irene?
Charley.

1420
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:25,120
Hello.

1421
01:58:25,805 --> 01:58:27,382
Everything is ok.

1422
01:58:27,685 --> 01:58:29,774
The Don's gonna give you
your money back.

1423
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:32,460
All 900 dollars, I got it right here.

1424
01:58:32,611 --> 01:58:34,445
The Don's giving money back?

1425
01:58:34,623 --> 01:58:35,623
Since when?

1426
01:58:35,744 --> 01:58:38,877
Yeah you could have knocked me
over.

1427
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:40,714
That ain't all.

1428
01:58:41,089 --> 01:58:44,841
He's gonna pay you every dime
for Filargi's stand...

1429
01:58:45,965 --> 01:58:47,751
and what Dominic set.

1430
01:58:48,429 --> 01:58:49,789
How about that?

1431
01:58:50,589 --> 01:58:51,755
Oh, Charley!

1432
01:58:53,333 --> 01:58:54,349
Well...

1433
01:58:55,581 --> 01:58:58,022
I'm glad
everything is settled.

1434
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:01,976
I just...

1435
01:59:02,279 --> 01:59:07,465
wanted you to know that
everything is a hundred percent ok.

1436
01:59:11,462 --> 01:59:16,065
Oh Marxie,
I should have listened.

1437
02:00:00,059 --> 02:00:04,769
After you take this stone out
of my shoe...

1438
02:00:05,525 --> 02:00:07,254
you call your father...

1439
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:10,533
and tell him where he can get her.

1440
02:00:10,846 --> 02:00:14,214
And then the wind will stop blowing.

1441
02:00:14,975 --> 02:00:18,231
Charley, you got 900,000 here.

1442
02:00:36,381 --> 02:00:40,198
What's the first flight out of L.A. To
Hong Kong in the morning?

1443
02:00:41,481 --> 02:00:45,068
Flight 009 at 10.45 am.

1444
02:00:45,305 --> 02:00:47,315
But we can get you to Hong Kong
tonight out of LA.

1445
02:00:47,445 --> 02:00:49,685
Oh no thank you I have to go
to the bank in the morning.

1446
02:00:49,785 --> 02:00:54,402
Reserve 009 then one seat, first class.
The name is Hilary Jackson.

1447
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:56,548
Mrs. Hilary Jackson.

1448
02:01:43,231 --> 02:01:44,431
Irene?

1449
02:01:55,445 --> 02:01:56,645
Irene?

1450
02:02:52,598 --> 02:02:53,798
Irene?

1451
02:02:55,342 --> 02:02:56,542
Irene?

1452
02:02:57,308 --> 02:02:59,059
Look who's here.

1453
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:07,766
Charley!
What a wonderful surprise!

1454
02:03:08,156 --> 02:03:10,475
Baby I got three whole days.

1455
02:03:10,611 --> 02:03:12,909
We can do anything you want.
You name it.

1456
02:03:15,783 --> 02:03:18,311
Baby we are gonna have a ball.

1457
02:03:51,587 --> 02:03:55,230
Jesus, what a beautiful song.

1458
02:03:57,292 --> 02:03:58,983
Why don't you go
and warm up the bed?

1459
02:03:59,119 --> 02:04:00,338
I'll be right there.

1460
02:04:02,706 --> 02:04:03,706
Yeah!

1461
02:06:04,913 --> 02:06:05,913
Mae?

1462
02:06:06,442 --> 02:06:07,442
Charley.

1463
02:06:07,782 --> 02:06:08,938
Charley, you know what?

1464
02:06:09,042 --> 02:06:12,773
My sister Theresa just got back
today from her honeymoon.

1465
02:06:13,964 --> 02:06:16,206
Where did they go?
Outer space?

1466
02:06:19,537 --> 02:06:21,222
What do you say...

1467
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:23,664
we go to dinner tonight?

1468
02:06:23,837 --> 02:06:24,982
Dinner?

1469
02:06:28,569 --> 02:06:29,736
What do you mean?

1470
02:06:29,930 --> 02:06:31,183
What do I mean?

1471
02:06:31,356 --> 02:06:34,224
I mean let's go some place
and get something to eat.

1472
02:06:34,490 --> 02:06:36,369
You, me and Irene?

1473
02:06:36,564 --> 02:06:37,564
No.

1474
02:06:38,854 --> 02:06:40,345
Just you and me.

1475
02:06:41,209 --> 02:06:42,744
What about Irene?

1476
02:06:44,602 --> 02:06:47,865
She had to go away.
She won't be back.

1477
02:06:51,430 --> 02:06:52,398
How about it?

1478
02:06:52,498 --> 02:06:53,699
How about?

1479
02:06:54,455 --> 02:06:58,020
Holy cow, Charley.
Just tell me where you want to meet.
