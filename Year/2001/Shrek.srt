1
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:49,782
Once upon a time there
was a lovely princess.

2
00:00:50,022 --> 00:00:53,941
But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort,

3
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:58,261
which could only be broken
by Love's first kiss.

4
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:04,581
She was locked away in a castle guarded
by a terrible fire breathing dragon.

5
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:11,661
Many brave knights had attempted to free her
from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.

6
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:18,420
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest
room of the tallest tower for her true love

7
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,460
and true love's first kiss.

8
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,820
Like that's ever going to happen.

9
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,460
What a loony.

10
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:51,618
Shrek

11
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:39,657
Beware

12
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:08,814
Stay out

13
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,331
I think he's in here.

14
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,571
All right. Lets get it!

15
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,451
Hold on. Do you know what
that thing can do to you?

16
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:37,811
Yeah. He'll groan into
your bones for his brains.

17
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,251
Well actually that would be a giant.

18
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,370
Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse.

19
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,610
They'll make a soup from
your freshly peeled skin.

20
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,370
They'll chew your livers,
squeeze the jelly from your eyes.

21
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,010
Actually, it's quite good on toast.

22
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:56,409
Back, back beast, back!

23
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,770
I warned you!

24
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,008
Right.

25
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:22,288
This is the part, where you run away.

26
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,648
Yeah!

27
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:32,927
And stay out.

28
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:39,047
Wanted. Fairytale creatures.

29
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:47,766
Right, this one is full. Take it away.

30
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,405
Give me that.

31
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:54,246
Your fine days are over. -25
pieces of silver for the witch.

32
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:59,326
Next. -Come on.

33
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:03,325
Sit down there! And be quiet!

34
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,645
This cage is so small.

35
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,045
You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never
be stubborn again. I can change.

36
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:09,524
Please, give me another chance.

37
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:11,444
Oh, shut up!

38
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:12,444
Next.

39
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:13,165
What do we got?

40
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:14,884
This little wooden puppet.

41
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:20,084
I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy.

42
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:22,364
Five shillings for the
possessed toy. Take it away.

43
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:24,323
No! Please, don't let them do it!

44
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:25,883
Next. What do you got?

45
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:29,043
Well, I've got a talking donkey!

46
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:30,083
Right.

47
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:33,203
Well that's good for ten
schillings, if you can prove it.

48
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:37,803
Oh, go ahead fella.

49
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:39,123
Well?

50
00:05:39,363 --> 00:05:41,522
He's just a li...,
just a little nervous.

51
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:44,122
He's really quite a chatterbox.

52
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:45,362
You boneheaded donkey!

53
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:46,762
That's it. I have heard enough. Guards!

54
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:49,682
No, no, he talks, he does!

55
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:52,282
I can talk. I love to talk.

56
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:55,921
I've talked to...

57
00:05:56,161 --> 00:06:01,801
Get her out of my
sight! -No, no, I swear!

58
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,881
Hey, I can fly. -He
can fly! -He can fly!

59
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,641
He can talk! -That's right, fool!

60
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,560
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey!

61
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,520
You might have seen house
fly, maybe even a superfly.

62
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,320
But I bet you ain't
never seen a donkey fly!

63
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:29,239
Seize him!

64
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:44,998
Get him! This way! Hurry!

65
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:50,958
You there. Ogre. -I.

66
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,677
By the order of lord Farquaad.

67
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:55,157
I am authorized to place
you both under arrest.

68
00:06:55,397 --> 00:07:01,157
And transport you to designated
resettlement facility.

69
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:02,797
Oh really?

70
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:07,677
You and what army?

71
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,276
Can I say something to you?

72
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:20,635
Listen, you were really, really
something, back there. Incredible.

73
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:23,716
Are you talking to...

74
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:26,035
...me?

75
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,435
Yes, I was talking to you.

76
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:30,123
Can I just tell you that you were really
great back there with those guards.

77
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,155
They thought that was all over there.

78
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:34,955
And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping
on over themselves like babes in the woods.

79
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,667
That really made me
feel good to see that.

80
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:37,914
Oh, that's great. Really.

81
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:39,154
Man, it's good to be free.

82
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:44,978
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

83
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:46,674
But I...

84
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:48,193
I don't have any friends.

85
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,714
And I'm not going out there by myself.

86
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:52,154
Hey wait a minute.
I have a great idea...

87
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:53,553
I'll stick with you.

88
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:54,874
You and me in green fighting machine.

89
00:07:55,113 --> 00:08:00,298
Together we'll scare the
spin if anybody crosses us.

90
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:04,112
Oh, a, that was really scary.

91
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:07,585
Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work,
your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause...

92
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:09,888
you definitively need
some tic-tac or something,

93
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,392
'cause your breath stinks!

94
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:14,072
Man you've? my note!

95
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:16,752
Just like the time...

96
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:18,272
...and then I ate some rotten berries.

97
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:20,512
Man I had some strong gases
leaking out of my but that day.

98
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:24,191
Why are you following me?

99
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:27,471
I'll tell you why.

100
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,591
'Cause I'm all alone,

101
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:33,551
there is no one here, beside me.

102
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:40,470
My problems have all gone.
There's no one to derive me.

103
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:45,270
But you got to have
free... -Stop singing!

104
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,950
Well, it's no wonder, you
don't have any friends.

105
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,661
Wow! Only a true friend
would be that truly honest.

106
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,190
Listen! Little donkey.

107
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:56,229
Take a look at me! What am I?

108
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,429
A...

109
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:00,309
...really tall?

110
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:05,669
No! I'm an Ogre. You know,
grab your torch and pitchforks.

111
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:08,829
Doesn't that bother you?

112
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,668
Nope.

113
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:12,868
Really? -Really really.

114
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:13,868
Oh?

115
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:16,028
Man, I like you. What's your name?

116
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:19,308
A..., Shrek.

117
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:20,908
Shrek?!

118
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:22,068
But do you know, what
I like about you, Shrek?

119
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,947
You've got that kind of: "I don't
care what nobody thinks of me" thing.

120
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:30,307
I like that, I respect that,
Shrek. You're all right.

121
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:32,107
Uh, look at that.

122
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,307
Who would wanna live
in a place like that?

123
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,667
That would be my home.

124
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:41,467
Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful.
You know you're quite a decorator.

125
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,026
It's amazing what you did
with such a modest budget.

126
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:50,226
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

127
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:54,746
I guess, you don't
entertain much, do you?

128
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,745
I like my privacy.

129
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:58,945
You know I do to. That's
another thing, we have in common.

130
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:02,145
Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face.
You try to give them a hint and they won't leave.

131
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:07,584
And then there's that big
occurred silence, you know?

132
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:10,825
Can I stay with you? -What?

133
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:13,344
Can I stay with you, please.

134
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:15,584
Of course! -Really?

135
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,064
No. -Please! I don't
want to go back there.

136
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:20,344
You don't how is like to
be concerned like a freak.

137
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,024
Well..., maybe you do. But that's
why we have to stick together!

138
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:25,263
You got to let me stay! Please! Please!

139
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:27,503
OK, OK.

140
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:29,983
- But one night only.
- Huh, thank you!

141
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:31,343
A, what are you do... No!

142
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,063
This is going to be fun. We can
stay up late, swap the manly stories.

143
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,382
And in the morning...

144
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,422
I'm making waffles.

145
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:40,342
Where do I sleep?

146
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,982
Outside!

147
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:46,782
Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know,
I don't know you and you don't know me...

148
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:50,382
...so I guess, outside is best for me.

149
00:10:50,621 --> 00:10:54,741
Here I go.

150
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:58,701
Good night.

151
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:02,461
I do like that half door. I'm
a donkey all alone outside.

152
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:07,461
Sit by myself outside, I guess.

153
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:15,300
I'm all alone, there's
no one here beside me.

154
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:20,615
- I thought, I told you to stay outside.
- I am outside.

155
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:28,215
Well James. This is far from the
farm, but what choice do we have?

156
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:31,655
It's not...

157
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:34,095
What a lovely bed. -Got you!

158
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:39,534
I found some cheese. Awful stuff.

159
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,734
- Is that you Gordon?
- How did you know?

160
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:47,766
Enough! What are you doing in my house?

161
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,653
Oh, no, no, no... Death
prods off the table!

162
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:56,094
Where would we supposed to
put her. The bed's taken.

163
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:57,933
What?

164
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:03,133
I live in a swamp. I've put up
signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre!

165
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:09,253
What do I have to do,
to get a little privacy?

166
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:16,411
Oh, no! No, no!

167
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:29,771
What are you doing in my swamp?

168
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,010
All right, get out of here. All
of you. Move it! Come on, let's go.

169
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,651
And hurry up, hurry up.

170
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,530
No, no, not there. Not there!

171
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,049
Hey don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.

172
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,809
Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What?

173
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,330
We were forced to come here. -By who?

174
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:59,849
Lord Farquaad. He?

175
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,489
All right.

176
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:08,728
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

177
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,888
Oh I do. I know where he is.

178
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:15,927
Does anyone else know where to find him?

179
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:18,608
- Anyone at all?
- Me. -Anyone?

180
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:22,488
Oh pick me, I know! Me, me.

181
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:24,968
Ok, fine.

182
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:29,887
Attention all fairy tale things!

183
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:33,766
Do not get comfortable. Your
welcome is officially warned up.

184
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:44,166
In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now
and get all off my land and back where you came from.

185
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:53,565
You. You're coming with me.

186
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:54,925
All right. That's what
I like to hear, man.

187
00:14:55,165 --> 00:15:00,765
Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off
on a world and big city adventure. I love it.

188
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:06,164
I'm on road again. Sing with
me Shrek! I'm on road again...

189
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:08,445
What did I say about singing?

190
00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:09,525
- Can I whistle?
- No.

191
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:14,644
- Well, can I hummer?
- All right.

192
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:46,762
That's enough. He's ready to talk.

193
00:15:56,721 --> 00:16:00,081
Run, run, run as fast as
you can, you can't catch me.

194
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:02,401
I'm the gingerbread man.

195
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,801
You monster.

196
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,560
I'm not a monster here. You are.

197
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,120
You and the rest of that fairytale
trash, poisoning my perfect world.

198
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,440
- Now tell me! Where are the others?
- Eat me.

199
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,040
I've tried to be fair to you, creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end!

200
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,879
- Tell me! Or I'll...
- No, no, not the buttons.

201
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,759
Not gumdrop buttons.

202
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,839
All right! Who's hiding them?

203
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,239
Ok, I'll tell you.

204
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:31,399
- Do you know the
muffin-man? -The muffin-man?

205
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,918
- The muffin-man. -Yes,
I know the muffin-man.

206
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:36,798
Who lives on Proully lane?

207
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,358
- Well, she's married to the
muffin-man. -The muffin-man!

208
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:44,598
- The muffin-man! -She's
married to the muffin-man.

209
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,718
My lord! We found it.

210
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:52,317
Well then, what are you
waiting for? Bring it in.

211
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,196
Magic mirror.

212
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:10,276
Don't tell him anything!

213
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:13,116
Evening.

214
00:17:13,356 --> 00:17:18,395
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not
the most perfect kingdom of them all?

215
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:21,555
Well, technically, you're not a king.

216
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:24,155
A..., felonious.

217
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:26,115
- You were saying.
- What I mean is a...

218
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:27,515
...you're not a king, yet.

219
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:32,315
But you can become one. All you
have to do, is marry a princess.

220
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:34,394
Go on.

221
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:37,474
So, just sit back and relax my lord,

222
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:42,354
because it's time for you to meet
today's eligible bachelorettes.

223
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,474
And here they are.

224
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:49,913
Bachelorette number one is a mentally
abused shading from a kingdom far, far away.

225
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:52,474
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.

226
00:17:52,713 --> 00:17:55,793
Her hobbies include cooking and
cleaning for two evil sisters.

227
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,833
Please welcome... Cinderella.

228
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:01,953
Bachelorette number two is a kemp
wearing girl from a land of fantasy.

229
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:04,913
Although she lives with seven
other man, she is not easy.

230
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:08,472
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and
find out what a live wife she is.

231
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,392
Come on. Give it up for... Show-white.

232
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:14,472
And last but certainly not least.

233
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:16,312
Bachelorette number three
is a fire-breathing?,

234
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:20,592
dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot
boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off.

235
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:24,351
She's a loaded pistol who likes Pina
Coladas and getting cut in the rain.

236
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:28,511
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.

237
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:32,710
So will it be, bachelorette number
one? Bachelorette number two?

238
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,991
Or bachelorette number three?

239
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:38,510
- Two...
- Three! -Two!

240
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,351
One. No, no, no.

241
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,590
Three. Pick number three my lord.

242
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,550
Ok, ok. Number three.

243
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:53,749
Lord Farquaad. You've
chosen... princess Fiona.

244
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:59,549
She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect.

245
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,749
All I have to do is just find someone...

246
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,469
But I probably should mention
little thing that happens at night...

247
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,148
- I'll do it!
- Yes, but after sunset...

248
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:07,828
Silence!

249
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:10,188
I will make this
princess Fiona my queen.

250
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:14,348
And Duloc will finally
have the perfect king!

251
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,707
Captain! Assemble your finest man.

252
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:22,347
We're going to have a tournament!

253
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,227
That's it, that's, right
there, that's Duloc.

254
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,827
I've told you I'll find it.

255
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:31,546
So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle.

256
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,626
Aha, that's the place.

257
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:38,986
Do you think maybe he's
compensating for something.

258
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:45,545
Hey, hey wait up Shrek!

259
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,385
- Hey, you!
- No, no!

260
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,226
Wait a second.

261
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:57,065
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just...

262
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:30,222
It's quiet.

263
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:34,463
Too quiet.

264
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:37,262
Where is everybody?

265
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:41,822
Hey look at this.

266
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:26,419
Wow!

267
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:31,978
- Let's do that again.
- No. no.

268
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:43,858
All right. You're going the
right way for smack bottom.

269
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:46,257
Sorry about that.

270
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:49,377
That champion should
have the honor, no, no...

271
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:58,497
...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely
princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon.

272
00:21:58,737 --> 00:22:05,696
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,
the first runner up will take his place.

273
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:08,137
And so on, and so forth.

274
00:22:08,376 --> 00:22:16,616
Some of you may die, but it's
a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

275
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:18,575
Applause.

276
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:24,335
Let the tournament begin.

277
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:29,335
What is that?

278
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:30,934
Ugh, it's hideous.

279
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:33,934
Oh, that's not very nice.

280
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:36,294
It's just a donkey.

281
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:37,774
Indeed.

282
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:42,894
Knights! New plan. The one, who kills
the Ogre, will be named champion.

283
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:44,974
How about him.

284
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:50,133
Oh, hey. Now, come on.

285
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,693
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

286
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:56,213
No?

287
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:59,172
All right then.

288
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:03,533
Come on.

289
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:36,051
Hey Shrek! Let me, let me!

290
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,610
The chair! Give him the chair!

291
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:12,648
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

292
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:16,888
I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel!

293
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:23,127
Shall I give the order sir?

294
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:26,767
No. I have a better idea.

295
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:31,687
People of Duloc. I
give you our champion!

296
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:33,767
What?

297
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,806
Congratulation, Ogre.

298
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:39,526
You've won the honor of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

299
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:42,286
Quest? I'm already on a quest.

300
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:44,086
A quest to get my swamp back!

301
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:47,086
- Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp!

302
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:50,605
Where you dumped those
fairytale creatures.

303
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:51,925
Indeed.

304
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:54,085
All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal.

305
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:58,405
Go on this quest for me and
I'll give you your swamp back.

306
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:00,844
Exactly the way it was?

307
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:03,244
Down to the last slime
covered toast tool.

308
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:07,604
- And the squatters?
- As good as gone.

309
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:13,924
What kind of quest?

310
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:14,683
Ok, let me get this straight!

311
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:19,044
We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess
just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp,

312
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:21,283
which you only don't have, 'cause he filled
it with full of freaks on the first place.

313
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:23,003
- Is that about right?
- You know what?

314
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:26,043
Maybe there is a good reason,
donkeys shouldn't talk.

315
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:29,043
I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you
just pull some old Ogre stuff on them?

316
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:34,170
You know,?. Grab his bones to make
you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick.

317
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:40,032
Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated
entire village and put their heads on plate.

318
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:44,321
Got a knife, cut open their
spleens and drink their fluids.

319
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:47,121
Does that sound good to you?

320
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:48,761
A, no, not really, no.

321
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:52,321
For your information, there is a
lot more to Ogres than people think.

322
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:54,841
- Example.
- Example?

323
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:59,201
OK, A-a-m, Ogres
are like onions.

324
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,841
- They stink?
- Yes, no.

325
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,201
- O, they make you cry.
- No.

326
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,632
Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they
get all brown and start? little wild hairs?

327
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,800
No! Layers! Onions have layers.

328
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,920
Ogres have layers. Onions have layers.

329
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,280
You get it? We both have layers.

330
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,679
O, you both have layers.

331
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:24,918
You know not everybody likes onions.

332
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:27,839
Cake! Everybody loves
cakes. Cakes have layers.

333
00:26:28,078 --> 00:26:31,518
I don't care what everyone likes.

334
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:35,878
Ogres are not like cakes.

335
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:39,238
You know what else
everyone likes? Paffe.

336
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:41,998
Have you ever met a person and you
say: "Hey, let's get some paffe" and

337
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:44,237
they say I don't like
paffe. Paffe is delicious.

338
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:48,598
No! You tensed, irritating,
miniature peace of barden.

339
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:51,317
Ogres are like onions. End of story.

340
00:26:51,557 --> 00:26:55,677
Bye, bye. See you lather.

341
00:26:58,357 --> 00:27:01,796
Paffe is maybe the most delicious
thing on the whole damn planet.

342
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,436
You know I think I've
preferred your humming.

343
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:06,916
Do you have a tissue or something,
'cause I'm making a mess.

344
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:11,275
Just the word paffe has
made me start slimying

345
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:50,073
Why, Shrek, did you do that?

346
00:27:50,313 --> 00:27:52,553
Man you got to warn somebody
before you just crack one off.

347
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:53,793
My mouth was opened and everything.

348
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:58,153
Believe me donkey, if
it was me, you'd be dead.

349
00:27:58,632 --> 00:28:01,553
It's brimstone. We
must be getting close.

350
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:04,072
Yeah, right, brimstone.

351
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:07,192
Don't be talking? brimstone. I
know what I smell and? no brimstone.

352
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:11,552
And they don't come of stone neither.

353
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,710
Sure it's big enough,
but look at the location.

354
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,349
Oh, Shrek, remember when you
said that Ogres have layers?

355
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,630
Oh, yeah.

356
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,910
Well, I have a confession to
make. Donkeys don't have layers.

357
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:46,150
We wear? sleeves.

358
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:48,429
Wait a second. Donkeys
don't have sleeves.

359
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:52,789
- You know what I mean.
- Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs.

360
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:57,269
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being
on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava!

361
00:28:57,304 --> 00:29:00,868
Come on donkey, I'm
right here beside you. Ok?

362
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:03,548
For emotional support.

363
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:07,908
We'll just hackle this thing together
one little baby step after time.

364
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,907
- Really?
- Really really.

365
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,083
Ok. That makes me feel so much better.

366
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:15,068
Just keep moving and don't look down.

367
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:19,427
Don't look down, don't look down.

368
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:25,867
Shrek! I'm looking down!

369
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:27,547
I can't do this. Just let
me off right now, please.

370
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:30,867
- But you're already half way.
- Yeah, but I know that half is safe.

371
00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:33,706
Ok, fine. I don't have
time for this. You go back.

372
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:38,066
Shrek, no, wait.

373
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:40,186
Don't do that!

374
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:43,306
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

375
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:47,145
- Oh. This?
- Yes, that!

376
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,585
Yes, yes. Do it. OK.

377
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:54,945
- No, Shrek!
- I'm doing it.

378
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:59,184
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna
die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.

379
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:05,624
That will do Donkey, that will do.

380
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:10,904
Cool.

381
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:13,495
So where is this fire breathing
pain in the neck anyway?

382
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:17,143
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her.

383
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:21,503
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.

384
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:40,262
- Are you afraid?
- No, but shhhhh.

385
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:44,981
Oh, good. Me neither.

386
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:49,341
Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid.
Here's a..., something responsible of the situation.

387
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:54,181
Not to mention dangerous situation.
And there's dragon that breathes fire.

388
00:30:54,901 --> 00:30:58,092
I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything,
but they're scare. You know what I mean.

389
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,260
I'm sure he's heavier than a cow...

390
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,660
Donkey. Two things. Ok?

391
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,139
Shut, up.

392
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,619
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

393
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:12,955
Stairs? I thought we were
looking for the princess.

394
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:17,219
The princess will be up the stairs in
the highest room in the tallest tower.

395
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:19,499
What makes you think she'll be there?

396
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:21,978
I read it in a book once.

397
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:25,858
Cool. You handle the dragon,
I'll handle the stairs.

398
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:28,498
Oh, I'll find those stairs.
I'll?. That's right.

399
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:32,858
Those stairs won't
know which way they go.

400
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,298
The drafting stairs,?

401
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:40,257
Don't mess with me. I'm the stair
master. I'm master of the stairs.

402
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:44,617
I wish I had a stair right here
right here now, I'd step all over it.

403
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:49,137
Well, at least we know
where the princess is.

404
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:53,497
- But where is the...
- Dragon!

405
00:32:07,296 --> 00:32:11,416
Donkey, look out!

406
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:23,176
Got you.

407
00:32:59,692 --> 00:33:02,772
Oh, what large teeth you have.

408
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:05,292
I mean, white sparkling teeth.

409
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:07,372
You probably hear this all
the time from your food, but

410
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,931
you must bleach yourself, because that
is one dashing smile you got there.

411
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:13,771
And do I detect the
hint of minty freshness?

412
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:16,571
And you know what else?

413
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:21,890
You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. I
mean 'course you're a girl dragon,

414
00:33:22,891 --> 00:33:27,011
'cause you're just ricking
the feminine beauty out.

415
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,250
What's the matter with you? Do
you have something in your eye?

416
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,690
Man, I'd really love to stay,
but you know I'm a asthmatic and

417
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,769
I don't know if we would worked out.
You'd be blowing smoke and stuff.

418
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,850
Shrek!

419
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:46,209
No, Shrek! Shrek!

420
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:18,407
- Wake up!
- What?

421
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:20,847
Are you princess Fiona?

422
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,766
I am.

423
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:25,447
Awaiting a knight so
bold as to rescue me.

424
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:27,606
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go.

425
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:29,727
But wait, sir knight.

426
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:31,806
This be our first meeting.

427
00:34:32,046 --> 00:34:35,365
Should not be wonderful,
romantic moment?

428
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,606
Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time.

429
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:41,957
Hey, what are you doing? You know,
you should sweep me out of my feet.

430
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:45,605
Out through the window and down
the rope by to your valued steed.

431
00:34:45,845 --> 00:34:47,725
You've had a lot of time
to plan this, haven't you?

432
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:52,085
Uh-um.

433
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:54,645
But we have to sing through this moment.

434
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,364
You can residing of a poem to me.

435
00:34:57,604 --> 00:35:01,724
A ballad, a sonnet, a
libretti. Or something.

436
00:35:02,204 --> 00:35:03,404
I don't think so.

437
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:07,763
Well, can I at least know
a name of my champion?

438
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:10,324
Shrek.

439
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:13,003
So, Shrek.

440
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:17,363
I pray that you take this favor
as a token of my gratitude.

441
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:23,203
Thanks.

442
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:28,563
- You didn't slay the dragon?
- It's not my job to do this. Now, come on!

443
00:35:28,882 --> 00:35:33,002
But this isn't right.?

444
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:35,242
That's what all the other knights did.

445
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:38,242
Yeah. Right before
they burst in the flame.

446
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:41,121
That's not the point.

447
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:43,601
Wait. Where are you
going? Exit is over there.

448
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,281
Well, I have to save my ass.

449
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,280
What kind of knight are you?

450
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:53,641
One of a kind.

451
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,040
...rush into a physical relationship.

452
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,359
I'm not that emotionally ready for
commitment of a this magnitude.

453
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,879
That was the word I was
looking for. Magnitude.

454
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,400
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.

455
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,239
Hey, what are you doing?

456
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:18,599
Ok, ok, let's just back up a little
and take this one step at the time.

457
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,991
I mean, we really should get to know each
other first, you know what am I saying.

458
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,159
As friends, maybe even as?

459
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:31,398
Hey don't do that. That's my
tail. That's ma personal tail.

460
00:36:31,638 --> 00:36:35,758
And you're going to tear it off...

461
00:36:38,717 --> 00:36:42,837
Oh, no. No!

462
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:12,435
- It talks?!
- Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick.

463
00:37:47,273 --> 00:37:50,913
Ok, you two. Head for the exit.

464
00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:55,232
I'll take care of the dragon.

465
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:03,151
Ruuuuun!

466
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:49,749
You did it. You rescued me.

467
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:54,108
Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a...

468
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:57,948
...a little unorthodox I admit, but

469
00:38:58,188 --> 00:39:04,226
by deed is great and by heart is
pure. I'm entirely in your debt.

470
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:10,267
And where would a brave knight
be without his noble steed.

471
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:12,987
I hope you heard that. She
called me a noble steed.

472
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:15,587
She thinks I'm a steed.

473
00:39:15,827 --> 00:39:19,947
The battle is won. You may remove
your helmet good sir knight.

474
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:23,546
- Aah, no.
- Why not?

475
00:39:23,787 --> 00:39:25,026
I have helmet hair.

476
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:28,034
Please. I wouldst look
upon the face of my rescuer.

477
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:30,626
Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust.

478
00:39:30,866 --> 00:39:33,066
But, how will you kiss me?

479
00:39:33,306 --> 00:39:37,425
What? That wasn't in a job description.

480
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:40,906
- Maybe it's a perk?
- No. It's destiny.

481
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,585
You must know how it goes.

482
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:49,862
A princess locked in a tower and besieged
by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight.

483
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:53,744
And then they share
true love's first kiss.

484
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:56,264
With Shrek? You think, wait...

485
00:39:56,504 --> 00:39:58,625
...you think Shrek is your true love?

486
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:02,984
Well, yes.

487
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:06,664
You think that Shrek is your true love.

488
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:08,783
What is so funny?

489
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:11,423
Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok?

490
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:15,063
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.

491
00:40:15,303 --> 00:40:17,183
Now, now remove your helmet.

492
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:19,615
Look. I really don't
think this is a good idea.

493
00:40:19,663 --> 00:40:21,463
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

494
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:22,623
- Take it off!
- No!

495
00:40:22,863 --> 00:40:26,463
- Now!
- Ok, easy.

496
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:30,822
As you command your highness.

497
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:43,261
You're an Ogre.

498
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:46,021
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

499
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:50,380
Well, yes, actually.

500
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:55,508
Oh no. This is all wrong. You're
not supposed to be an Ogre.

501
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,860
Princess, I was sent to rescue
you by lord Farquaad, ok?

502
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:02,819
He's the one, who wants to marry you.

503
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,220
Well, then why didn't
he come to rescue me?

504
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:08,619
Good question. You should ask
him that, when we get there.

505
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:11,739
But I have to be
rescued by my true love.

506
00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:14,699
Not by some Ogre and his pet.

507
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,538
Well so much for noble steed.

508
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:19,210
Look princess. You're not
making my job any easier.

509
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:22,419
Well I'm sorry, but your
job is not my problem.

510
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:27,641
You can tell lord Farquaad that
if he wants to rescue me properly,

511
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:29,977
I'll be waiting for him right here.

512
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:33,537
Hey, I'm no ones
messenger boy, all right?

513
00:41:33,778 --> 00:41:37,898
- I'm a delivery boy.
- You wouldn't dare.

514
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,617
- You coming donkey?
- Put me down!

515
00:41:39,857 --> 00:41:41,417
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

516
00:41:41,657 --> 00:41:44,537
Put me down or you will
suffer the consequences.

517
00:41:44,777 --> 00:41:48,936
This is not dignified. Put me down.

518
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:54,168
Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a
woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her,

519
00:41:54,217 --> 00:41:57,368
that way. Now, how you let her down
real easy, so her feelings aren't hurt?

520
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:00,111
But you don't get burned to a
crisp neither. How do you do this?

521
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:02,256
Just tell her, she's not your true love.

522
00:42:02,495 --> 00:42:05,535
Everyone knows it what
happens when you find...

523
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:10,087
Hey! The sooner we get
to Duloc, the better.

524
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:12,695
Oh, yeah. You gonna love it
there princess. It's beautiful.

525
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:16,406
And what of my groom to be,
lord Farquaad. What's he like?

526
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:19,214
Well, let me put it this way, princess.

527
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:23,614
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

528
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:28,533
Oh no, Shrek. There are
those who think little of him.

529
00:42:30,894 --> 00:42:33,294
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

530
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:37,845
You know, you're just jealous that you can never
measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad.

531
00:42:38,493 --> 00:42:44,627
Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd
like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow

532
00:42:44,989 --> 00:42:47,133
Tomorrow?

533
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:49,012
It will take that long?

534
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:53,372
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No. That would take longer.

535
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:54,492
We can keep going.

536
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:57,492
But there are robbers in the woods.

537
00:42:57,732 --> 00:43:00,604
Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is
definitely something that sounds good.

538
00:43:00,652 --> 00:43:04,412
Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than
anything we're gonna see in this forest.

539
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:08,771
I need to find somewhere to camp, now!

540
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:15,531
Hey, over here.

541
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:19,890
Shrek, we can do better than that. Now,
I don't think this is decent for princess.

542
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,130
No, no, it's perfect. It just
needs a few homey touches.

543
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:27,490
Homey touches? Like what?

544
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,490
A door.

545
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,929
Well, gentleman I'll
be d..., good night.

546
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,201
Do you want me to come in and read
you a bedtime story, 'cause I will...

547
00:43:34,249 --> 00:43:38,369
I said good night!

548
00:43:39,937 --> 00:43:42,409
Shrek! What are you doing?

549
00:43:42,649 --> 00:43:43,968
I just..., you know...

550
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:48,329
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.

551
00:43:52,648 --> 00:43:55,488
And that one, that's Throwback.

552
00:43:55,728 --> 00:43:59,048
The only Ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

553
00:43:59,288 --> 00:44:03,047
Right. Yeah.

554
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:04,727
Hey, can you tell my
future form these stars?

555
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:06,887
Well, the stars don't
tell the future, Donkey.

556
00:44:07,128 --> 00:44:09,608
They tell stories. Look.

557
00:44:09,751 --> 00:44:11,647
There's Blodna, the "Flatulent"

558
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:14,006
You can guess what he is famous for.

559
00:44:14,247 --> 00:44:15,647
All right. Now I know
you're making this up.

560
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:20,007
No. Look. There he is and there's the
group of hunters running away from his stag.

561
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:23,806
Man, there ain't nothing,
but a bunch of little dots.

562
00:44:24,046 --> 00:44:28,166
You know donkey, sometimes
things are more than they appear.

563
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:34,045
Forget it.

564
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:38,325
Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do
when we get our swamp back, anyway?

565
00:44:38,565 --> 00:44:42,205
- Our swamp?
- You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff.

566
00:44:42,445 --> 00:44:46,165
We? Donkey, there is
no we. There's no our.

567
00:44:46,404 --> 00:44:48,405
There's just me and my swamp.

568
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:52,764
And the first thing I'm gonna do, is
build a ten foot wall around my land.

569
00:44:54,204 --> 00:44:58,324
You cut me deep Shrek, you
cut me real deep just now.

570
00:44:58,684 --> 00:45:02,996
You know, what I think? I think this whole
wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.

571
00:45:03,924 --> 00:45:07,003
No, do you think?

572
00:45:07,243 --> 00:45:10,283
- Are you hiding something?
- Never mind Donkey.

573
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:13,443
Oh, this is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

574
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:16,763
No. This is one of those drop
it and leave it alone things.

575
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:20,402
- Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to talk about it?

576
00:45:20,643 --> 00:45:22,843
- Oh, Why you block? -I'm not
blocking. -Oh yes you are.

577
00:45:23,082 --> 00:45:26,242
- Donkey, I'm warning you.
- Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who?

578
00:45:26,482 --> 00:45:28,882
Everyone, ok?

579
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:33,242
- Oh, now we're getting somewhere.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

580
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,001
Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do
you got against the whole world anyway?

581
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:39,201
Look. I'm not the one
with the problem, ok?

582
00:45:39,442 --> 00:45:42,041
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

583
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:46,081
People take one look at me
and go: AAA... Help! Run!

584
00:45:46,224 --> 00:45:50,440
A big stupid ugly Ogre.

585
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,688
They judge me, before they even know me.

586
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:58,049
That's why I'm better off alone.

587
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:08,759
You know what? When we met, I didn't
think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

588
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,319
Yeah, I know.

589
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:17,399
So, a... Are there any donkeys up there?

590
00:46:17,638 --> 00:46:21,758
Well, there's a Cabby.
The small and annoying.

591
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:27,038
Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining
one, right there. That one, over there?

592
00:46:27,877 --> 00:46:32,038
That's the moon.

593
00:46:52,236 --> 00:46:56,356
Again. Show me again.

594
00:46:57,836 --> 00:47:01,956
Mirror, mirror, show her
to me. Show me the princess.

595
00:47:07,636 --> 00:47:11,754
Perfect.

596
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:16,630
Yeah. You know I like like
that. Oh come on baby...

597
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:20,790
- Donkey. Wake up.
- What? -Wake up.

598
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,830
Morning. How do you like your eggs?

599
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,477
- Good morning princess.
- What's all this about?

600
00:48:29,526 --> 00:48:34,509
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start
yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you.

601
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:39,429
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

602
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:42,869
Thanks.

603
00:48:43,108 --> 00:48:47,228
Well, eat up. We've got
a big day ahead of us.

604
00:48:52,188 --> 00:48:54,588
- Shrek!
- What? It's a compliment.

605
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:57,292
Better out than in I always say.

606
00:48:57,436 --> 00:49:00,908
But that's no way to behave
in front of a princess.

607
00:49:01,148 --> 00:49:04,628
- Thanks.
- She's as nasty as you are.

608
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:08,147
You know. You're not
exactly what I've expected.

609
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:12,507
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge
people before you get to know them.

610
00:49:18,563 --> 00:49:21,218
Princess!

611
00:49:21,746 --> 00:49:23,026
What are you doing?

612
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:31,222
?mon shery, for I am your saviour. And
I am rescuing you from this green... beast.

613
00:49:32,225 --> 00:49:35,305
Hey! That's my princess.
Go find your own.

614
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:39,665
Please, monster. Can't you
see I'm a little busy here?

615
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:43,945
Look, pal. I don't know
who you think you are.

616
00:49:44,185 --> 00:49:45,824
Oh, of course. How rude that was.

617
00:49:46,064 --> 00:49:50,184
Please, let me introduce
myself. Oh marry men!

618
00:50:35,822 --> 00:50:37,261
Man, that was annoying.

619
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,620
Oh, you little...

620
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:09,459
Shall we?

621
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,339
?all the forin?

622
00:51:13,578 --> 00:51:16,458
Whoa, hold on, now.
Where did that come from?

623
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:20,139
- What?
- That. Back there. That was amazing.

624
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:21,658
Where did you learn that?

625
00:51:21,898 --> 00:51:27,169
Well, when one lives alone one has to
learn these things in case there's a...

626
00:51:27,658 --> 00:51:28,937
There is an arrow in your butt.

627
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:31,658
What? Oh, would you look at that.

628
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:34,658
Oh, no... This is all
my fault. I'm so sorry.

629
00:51:34,897 --> 00:51:38,377
- What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt.
- Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt!

630
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:40,817
- Oh, no. Shrek's going to die.
- Donkey, I'm ok.

631
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:43,377
You can't do this to me Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.

632
00:51:43,616 --> 00:51:44,897
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head?.

633
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:48,016
- Does anyone know how to handle...
- Donkey! Calm down.

634
00:51:48,256 --> 00:51:52,376
If you want to help Shrek, run into woods
and find me a blue flower with red thorns.

635
00:51:52,616 --> 00:51:56,736
Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue
flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

636
00:51:56,896 --> 00:51:59,176
Don't die Shrek. And if you see a
long tunnel, stay away from the light!

637
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:03,215
- Donkey!
- Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

638
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:07,135
- What are the flowers for?
- For getting rid of the Donkey.

639
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,575
Now, you hold still and
I'll yank this thing out.

640
00:52:09,815 --> 00:52:13,494
- Hey! Easy with the yanking.
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

641
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:16,974
No, no. It's tender. What you're
doing here is the opposite...

642
00:52:17,214 --> 00:52:23,252
- Don't move. -Ok, look.
Time out. -Would you... Ok.

643
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:25,374
What do you propose we do?

644
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:27,614
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower,
red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

645
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:29,934
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't colorblind.

646
00:52:30,174 --> 00:52:32,013
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

647
00:52:32,254 --> 00:52:35,414
Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming!

648
00:52:37,413 --> 00:52:38,693
Not good.

649
00:52:38,933 --> 00:52:43,053
Ok, ok, I can lose
it. It's just about it.

650
00:52:47,692 --> 00:52:48,453
Nothing happened.

651
00:52:48,692 --> 00:52:50,292
We were just a...

652
00:52:50,532 --> 00:52:53,131
Look if you want to be alone,
all you had to do is ask, ok?

653
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:56,612
Oh, come on. That's the
last thing on my mind.

654
00:52:56,851 --> 00:53:00,971
The princess here was just... Au!

655
00:53:05,531 --> 00:53:09,651
Hey, what's that? Is that...

656
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:38,085
There it is, princess.

657
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:40,925
- Your future awaits you.
- That's Duloc?

658
00:54:41,165 --> 00:54:46,435
Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is
compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a

659
00:54:49,084 --> 00:54:50,724
I guess we better move on.

660
00:54:50,964 --> 00:54:55,083
Sure, but Shrek...

661
00:54:55,203 --> 00:54:56,684
- I'm worried about Donkey.
- What?

662
00:54:56,924 --> 00:55:00,244
I mean. Look at him.
He doesn't look so good.

663
00:55:00,483 --> 00:55:02,883
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.
- Well, that's what they always say.

664
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:06,843
And the next thing you
know you're on your back.

665
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:10,083
- Dead!
- You know she's right. You look awful.

666
00:55:10,323 --> 00:55:13,403
- Do you want to sit down?
- You know, I'll make you up some tea.

667
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:14,803
Well, I won't say nothing, but

668
00:55:15,043 --> 00:55:18,202
I've got this twinge in my neck. And if
I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see?

669
00:55:18,442 --> 00:55:21,282
- He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner.
- I'll get the firewood.

670
00:55:21,522 --> 00:55:27,560
Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't
feel my thumbs. I don't have any thumbs!

671
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:31,283
I think I need a hug.

672
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,840
This is good. This is really good.

673
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:45,280
- What is this?
- Wheat rat.

674
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:49,641
- Rotisserie style.
- No kidding.

675
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,079
- Oh, this is delicious.
- Well, they also great in stews.

676
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,440
Now, I don't mean to brag, but
I make a mean wheat rat stew.

677
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:05,639
I guess I'll be dining a little
different late tomorrow night.

678
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:09,678
Maybe you can come visit
me in the swamp sometime.

679
00:56:09,919 --> 00:56:12,038
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

680
00:56:12,278 --> 00:56:16,398
Swamp toast, soup fish,
eye tartar. You name it.

681
00:56:17,646 --> 00:56:20,040
I'd like that.

682
00:56:27,816 --> 00:56:34,717
- Ah..., princess?
- Yes, Shrek?

683
00:56:35,997 --> 00:56:39,477
I'm a... I was wondering.

684
00:56:39,716 --> 00:56:43,836
Are you... a...

685
00:56:44,597 --> 00:56:48,716
Are you gonna eat that?

686
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,035
Man, isn't this romantic.
Just look at that sunset.

687
00:56:56,276 --> 00:57:00,396
Sunset?! Oh, no. It's
late. It's very late.

688
00:57:01,035 --> 00:57:04,555
- What?
- Wait a minute. I see what's going on here.

689
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:06,435
You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you?

690
00:57:06,675 --> 00:57:10,795
Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm
terrified. You know I'll better go inside.

691
00:57:11,035 --> 00:57:13,435
But don't feel bad, princess. I
used to be afraid of the dark too.

692
00:57:13,675 --> 00:57:17,794
Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm
still afraid of the dark.

693
00:57:18,754 --> 00:57:22,874
- Good night.
- Good night.

694
00:57:25,635 --> 00:57:28,794
Ahh. Now I really see
what's going on here.

695
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:30,714
Oh, what are you talking about.

696
00:57:30,857 --> 00:57:32,993
Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look,
I'm an animal and I got instincts.

697
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:35,353
And I know that you two are digging
on each other. I can feel it.

698
00:57:35,593 --> 00:57:38,812
Oh, you're crazy. I'm just
bringing her back to Farquaad.

699
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:42,032
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake
up and smell the fairemones.

700
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:44,713
Just go in there and
tell her how you feel.

701
00:57:44,953 --> 00:57:49,112
There's nothing to tell. Besides, even
if I did tell her that... well you know.

702
00:57:50,472 --> 00:57:54,032
I'm not saying that
I do, 'cause I don't.

703
00:57:54,272 --> 00:57:56,752
She's a princess and I'm...

704
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,112
...an Ogre.

705
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:01,951
Yeah, an Ogre.

706
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:06,311
- Hey, where are you going?
- To get more firewood.

707
00:58:24,229 --> 00:58:28,349
Princess. Princess Fiona?

708
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:37,029
Princess, where are you?

709
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:44,349
Princess?

710
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:50,108
It's very spooky in here and
are we playing little games.

711
00:58:59,067 --> 00:59:01,667
- No, no.
- Help! Shrek! Shrek!

712
00:59:01,907 --> 00:59:03,507
- No. -Shrek!
- It's ok. It's ok.

713
00:59:03,747 --> 00:59:06,667
- What did you do with the princess?
- Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess.

714
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:11,026
- It's me, in this body.
- Oh my god. You ate the princess.

715
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:12,826
- Can you hear me?
- Donkey!

716
00:59:13,066 --> 00:59:16,106
Listen, keep breathing.
I'll get you out of there!

717
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:18,946
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

718
00:59:19,186 --> 00:59:23,306
This is me.

719
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:29,226
Princess? What happened to you?

720
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,945
You're a... different.

721
00:59:33,185 --> 00:59:35,113
- I'm ugly, ok?
- Yeah.

722
00:59:35,161 --> 00:59:38,265
Was it something that you ate? 'Cause
I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.

723
00:59:38,505 --> 00:59:43,584
- You are what you eat, I say.
- No. I've been this way as long as I can remember.

724
00:59:44,384 --> 00:59:46,704
What do you mean? Look, I've
never seen you like this before.

725
00:59:46,944 --> 00:59:51,064
It only happens when the sun goes down.

726
00:59:51,192 --> 00:59:58,860
By night one way, by day another. This shall be
the norm until you find true love's first kiss.

727
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:04,223
Then, take love's true form...

728
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:09,263
- Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.
- It's the spell.

729
01:00:10,702 --> 01:00:14,822
When I was a little girl,
a witch cast a spell on me.

730
01:00:15,062 --> 01:00:19,182
Every night I become this.
This horrible ugly beast.

731
01:00:23,742 --> 01:00:27,861
I was placed in a tower to await the
day when my true love would rescue me.

732
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:35,338
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow,
before the sun sets and he sees me, like this?

733
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:42,220
All right, all right. Calm down. Look,
it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.

734
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,460
Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly.
But you only look like this at night.

735
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,540
Shrek's ugly 24/7.

736
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:53,858
But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this
is not how a princess is meant to look.

737
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:59,019
Princess. How about if
you don't marry Farquaad?

738
01:00:59,259 --> 01:01:03,379
I have to. Only my true love's
kiss can brake the spell.

739
01:01:03,979 --> 01:01:07,298
But you know, you're kind of an Ogre.

740
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,618
And Shrek... Well you've
got a lot in common.

741
01:01:10,858 --> 01:01:12,258
Shrek?

742
01:01:12,499 --> 01:01:18,536
Princess, I... How is it going first
of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.

743
01:01:20,418 --> 01:01:23,978
I saw this flower and thought
of you because it's pretty.

744
01:01:24,217 --> 01:01:29,296
And, well, I don't really like it, but I
thought you may like it, because you're pretty.

745
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:34,097
But I like you anyway. A...

746
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:38,817
I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go.

747
01:01:44,776 --> 01:01:48,896
Who could ever love a piece so hideous and
ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together.

748
01:01:49,496 --> 01:01:55,534
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance
to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

749
01:01:58,176 --> 01:02:02,295
Don't you see, Donkey?
That's just how it has to be.

750
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,175
It's the only way to break the spell.

751
01:02:06,232 --> 01:02:08,094
Well, at least you've
got tell Shrek the truth.

752
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:11,015
No, no. You can't breathe the
word. No one must ever know.

753
01:02:11,254 --> 01:02:13,614
What's the point of being unable
to talk? You got to keep secrets.

754
01:02:13,854 --> 01:02:16,014
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

755
01:02:16,254 --> 01:02:19,740
All right, all right. I won't
tell him. But you should.

756
01:02:19,775 --> 01:02:22,493
You know, before this is over, I'm going
to need whole lot of serious therapies.

757
01:02:22,733 --> 01:02:26,853
Look at my eye twitching.

758
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:52,332
I tell him, I tell him not.

759
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:56,172
I tell him. I tell him not.

760
01:02:56,411 --> 01:02:57,931
I tell him!

761
01:02:58,171 --> 01:03:02,291
Shrek! Shrek! There's
something I want...

762
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:26,770
Shrek. Are you all right?

763
01:03:27,009 --> 01:03:29,569
Perfect. Never been better.

764
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:32,929
I... There's something
I have to tell you.

765
01:03:33,169 --> 01:03:36,808
You don't have to tell me anything,
princess. I heard enough last night.

766
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:39,769
- You've heard what I said?
- Every word.

767
01:03:40,008 --> 01:03:41,009
I thought you'd understand?

768
01:03:41,248 --> 01:03:46,327
Oh, I understand! Like you said,
who could love a hideous, ugly beast!

769
01:03:48,168 --> 01:03:52,287
- I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
- Yeah, well, it does.

770
01:03:53,847 --> 01:03:58,734
Ah, right on time. Princess. I
brought you a little something.

771
01:04:04,527 --> 01:04:08,646
What I missed? What I missed?

772
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:15,046
- Princess Fiona.
- As promised. Now hand it over.

773
01:04:15,646 --> 01:04:20,725
Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp.
Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go.

774
01:04:21,606 --> 01:04:24,525
Before I change my mind.

775
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:28,925
Forgive me princess for startling
you, but you startled me.

776
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,525
For I've never seen such
a radiant beauty before.

777
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:36,884
- I am lord Farquaad.
- Lord Farquaad?

778
01:04:38,404 --> 01:04:47,031
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for
I was just saying short... farewell.

779
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:51,604
Oh. That is so sweet. You don't have
to raise good manners on the Ogre.

780
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:56,683
- It's not like it has feelings.
- No. You're right. It doesn't.

781
01:04:58,524 --> 01:05:02,123
Princess Fiona, beautiful
fair flawless Fiona,

782
01:05:02,363 --> 01:05:08,401
I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be
the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

783
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:17,601
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

784
01:05:17,842 --> 01:05:21,162
Excellent! I'll start the
plans for tomorrow we wedd...

785
01:05:21,402 --> 01:05:25,122
No! I mean I... Why wait?

786
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:29,121
Let's get married today. Before sunset.

787
01:05:29,361 --> 01:05:32,761
Oh, anxious are we? You're
right. The sooner, the better.

788
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:35,417
There's so much to do.

789
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:40,160
There is the camera, the cake, the band,
the guests... Captain! Round up some guests.

790
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,480
Farewell Ogre.

791
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,720
Shrek, what are you doing?
You let her get away.

792
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,680
- Yeah, so what.
- Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know.

793
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,480
- I talked to her last night. She's...
- Yeah I know you talked to her last night.

794
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:57,839
You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are
such good friend, why didn't you follow her home?

795
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:01,679
- Shrek. I want to go with you.
- I told you, didn't I?

796
01:06:01,919 --> 01:06:06,997
You're not coming home with me. I live
alone. My swamp, me and nobody else!

797
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:13,796
Understand? Nobody! Especially useless,
pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

798
01:06:14,758 --> 01:06:18,878
- But. I thought...
- Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong.

799
01:06:21,318 --> 01:06:25,437
Shrek.

800
01:08:38,349 --> 01:08:40,548
Donkey?

801
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:41,628
What are you doing?

802
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:44,828
I was thinking of all the people, you
would recognize a wall when you see one.

803
01:08:45,068 --> 01:08:49,763
Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to
go around my swamp. Not through it.

804
01:08:49,868 --> 01:08:52,427
It is around your half. See? That's
your half and this is my half.

805
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:55,187
Oh, your half?

806
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:58,187
Yes, my half. I helped
rescue the princess.

807
01:08:58,427 --> 01:09:02,546
I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand
me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head

808
01:09:03,547 --> 01:09:05,746
- Back off!
- No. You back off!

809
01:09:05,986 --> 01:09:07,587
- This is my swamp.
- Our swamp.

810
01:09:07,826 --> 01:09:09,346
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go!

811
01:09:09,586 --> 01:09:11,346
- Stubborn jackass.
- Smelly Ogre.

812
01:09:11,586 --> 01:09:13,426
Fine!

813
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,746
Hey, hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you, yet.

814
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:20,105
- Well, I'm through with you!
- Well, you know. You were always me, me, me.

815
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:22,506
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn!

816
01:09:22,745 --> 01:09:26,265
So you just shut up and pay attention!

817
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:29,385
You are mean to me, you insult me, you
don't appreciate anything that I do!

818
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,744
You're always pushing me
around or pushing me away.

819
01:09:31,985 --> 01:09:36,105
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you
so bad, how come you came back?

820
01:09:36,225 --> 01:09:39,504
Because that's what friend
do. They forgive each other!

821
01:09:39,744 --> 01:09:45,262
Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. I
forgive you for stabbing me in the back!

822
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:51,983
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion
boy. You're afraid of your own feelings.

823
01:09:52,223 --> 01:09:55,303
- Go away.
- See? There you are, doing it again. Just like you did it to Fiona.

824
01:09:55,543 --> 01:09:57,703
And all she ever do, was
like you. Maybe even love you.

825
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:02,062
Love me? She said I was
ugly! A hideous creature.

826
01:10:02,183 --> 01:10:06,303
- I heard that you two were talking.
- She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about...

827
01:10:07,022 --> 01:10:10,342
...somebody else.

828
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:14,702
She wasn't talking about me? Well
then, who was she talking about?

829
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:18,701
No way, I'm not saying anything.
You won't listen to me, right? Right?

830
01:10:18,941 --> 01:10:21,141
- Donkey.
- No!

831
01:10:21,382 --> 01:10:25,502
Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right?

832
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:32,820
I'm sorry.

833
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:37,180
I guess I am just a
big stupid, ugly Ogre.

834
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:42,140
Can you forgive me?

835
01:10:42,228 --> 01:10:45,259
- Hey, that's the friends are for, right?
- Right.

836
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,820
- Friends?
- Friends.

837
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:53,180
So? What did Fiona said about me?

838
01:10:54,259 --> 01:10:56,859
Why are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her.

839
01:10:57,099 --> 01:11:00,459
The wedding! We'll
never make it in time!

840
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:02,619
Never fear! For where there
is a will, there is a way.

841
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:06,978
And I have I way.

842
01:11:09,618 --> 01:11:11,738
Donkey?

843
01:11:11,978 --> 01:11:17,057
- I guess this is just my act of magnetism.
- Oh, come here, you.

844
01:11:17,257 --> 01:11:20,097
All right. All right. Don't get
all started. No one likes kissass.

845
01:11:20,338 --> 01:11:22,057
All right, hop on. Hold on tight.

846
01:11:22,297 --> 01:11:26,417
I hadn't have a chance to
install seat belts, yet.

847
01:11:55,895 --> 01:12:05,768
People of Duloc. We gather here today to
bear witness to reunion of our new king...

848
01:12:05,934 --> 01:12:10,054
Excuse me. Could you just
skip ahead to "I do's"?

849
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:13,855
Go on.

850
01:12:16,016 --> 01:12:22,054
Go ahead and have some fun, if we
need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

851
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:25,613
Shrek, wait, wait a minute. You
want to do this right, don't you?

852
01:12:25,853 --> 01:12:28,853
- What are you talking about?
- It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for.

853
01:12:29,092 --> 01:12:31,292
The priest is going to say: "Speak
now or forever hold your peace".

854
01:12:31,533 --> 01:12:33,733
And that's where you say: "I object".

855
01:12:33,973 --> 01:12:36,972
- I don't have time for this.
- Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!

856
01:12:37,212 --> 01:12:38,372
Look, you love this woman, don't you?

857
01:12:38,612 --> 01:12:39,532
- Yes.
- You want to hold her!

858
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:41,812
- Yes. -Please
her! -Yes!

859
01:12:42,052 --> 01:12:45,052
Then you got to, got to
try a little tender love.

860
01:12:45,196 --> 01:12:49,411
- The chicks love that romantic crap.
- All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

861
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:51,859
We got to check it out.

862
01:12:51,907 --> 01:12:54,851
And as so by the power of these two...

863
01:12:55,091 --> 01:12:56,731
What do you see?

864
01:12:56,971 --> 01:13:01,091
- I now pronounce you...
- There they go!

865
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:06,850
- ... he all ready said it.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

866
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:09,570
I object!

867
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:11,290
Shrek?

868
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:15,650
Oh, now what does he want?

869
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:20,449
Hi, everyone. Having a
good time, aren't you?

870
01:13:20,689 --> 01:13:22,290
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

871
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:26,649
- What are you doing here?
- Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you.

872
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,969
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...

873
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:32,588
- Fiona! I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?

874
01:13:32,623 --> 01:13:35,968
Well it's a little late for
that. So if you'll excuse me.

875
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:38,609
- But you can't marry him!
- And why not?

876
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:42,933
Because, because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

877
01:13:42,968 --> 01:13:46,248
- Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
- He's not your true love.

878
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:51,854
- What do you know about true love?
- Well, I... I'm in...

879
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:55,087
Oh, this is precious.

880
01:13:55,327 --> 01:13:59,447
The Ogre has fallen in
love with the princess.

881
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:04,087
Laugh.

882
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:11,846
Shrek. Is this true?

883
01:14:12,085 --> 01:14:19,082
Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we
gonna kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me!

884
01:14:24,925 --> 01:14:29,045
By night one way, by day another.

885
01:14:30,013 --> 01:14:34,324
I wanted to show you before.

886
01:14:54,683 --> 01:14:58,803
Well. That explains a lot.

887
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:04,921
Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. I
order you to get them out of my sight.

888
01:15:05,683 --> 01:15:09,802
- Now! Get them! Get them, both!
- No!

889
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:15,002
This marriage is minding, and
that makes me king. See? See?

890
01:15:15,081 --> 01:15:16,362
- Shrek!
- No.

891
01:15:16,601 --> 01:15:20,721
- Don't just stand there, you dogs.
- Get out of my way.

892
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,081
No! Shrek!

893
01:15:31,321 --> 01:15:33,521
- And as for you my wife.
- Fiona!

894
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,880
I'll have you locked back in that
tower for the rest of your days!

895
01:15:38,761 --> 01:15:42,879
I will have order. I will
have potential. I will have...

896
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:52,239
All right, nobody move! I got a dragon
here and I'm not afraid to use it.

897
01:15:52,599 --> 01:15:56,719
I'm a donkey on the edge!

898
01:15:58,039 --> 01:16:02,159
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?

899
01:16:03,518 --> 01:16:06,718
Go ahead Shrek.

900
01:16:06,958 --> 01:16:11,078
- Fiona?
- Yes, Shrek?

901
01:16:11,398 --> 01:16:15,518
I love you.

902
01:16:15,797 --> 01:16:18,238
Really?

903
01:16:18,477 --> 01:16:21,757
Really, really.

904
01:16:21,997 --> 01:16:26,117
I love you too.

905
01:16:32,637 --> 01:16:36,756
A time for true love's first kiss...

906
01:17:09,994 --> 01:17:14,113
Fiona?

907
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:18,793
Fiona? Are you all right?

908
01:17:20,593 --> 01:17:24,393
Yes. But I don't understand.

909
01:17:24,633 --> 01:17:28,753
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

910
01:17:29,433 --> 01:17:33,553
But you are beautiful.

911
01:17:33,592 --> 01:17:37,712
I was hoping this
would be a happy ending.

912
01:18:21,654 --> 01:18:25,390
God bless us, everyone.

913
01:19:27,588 --> 01:19:31,884
The End.
