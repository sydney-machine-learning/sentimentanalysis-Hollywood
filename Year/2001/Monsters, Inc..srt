1
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,914
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.

2
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,000
Sleep tight, kiddo.

3
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,632
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>

4
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:14,553
<i>Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.</i>

5
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:18,849
<i>Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.</i>

6
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,976
All right, Mr Bile, is it?

7
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:23,645
Uh, my friends call me Phlegm.

8
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,107
Uh-huh. Mr Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

9
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,986
- I fell down?
- No, no, before that.

10
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:34,906
Can anyone tell me
Mr Bile's big mistake?

11
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,034
Anyone?

12
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,829
Let's take a look at the tape.
Here we go.

13
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:43,790
Uh, right...
buh, buh, buh, buh... Ah, there.

14
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:46,126
See? The door.
You left it wide open.

15
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,505
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake...

16
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:53,467
any employee can make because...

17
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,553
Um, it could let in a draught?

18
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,139
It could let in a child!

19
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:01,224
Oh, Mr Waternoose!

20
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:06,104
There's nothing more toxic or deadly
than a human child.

21
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:08,357
A single touch could kill you.

22
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:13,320
Leave a door open and a child
could walk right into this factory...

23
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,405
right into the monster world.

24
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,783
I won't go in a kid's room!
You can't make me!

25
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:21,870
You're going in there
because we need this.

26
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:31,838
Our city is counting on you
to collect those children's screams.

27
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:35,050
Without scream, we have no power.

28
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:39,554
Yes, it's dangerous work, and that's why
I need you to be at your best.

29
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:45,727
I need scarers who are confident,
tenacious, tough, intimidating.

30
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:48,814
I need scarers like... like...

31
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:51,108
James P. Sullivan.

32
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:58,031
Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's
now five after the hour of 6:00 a.m...

33
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,158
in the big monster city.

34
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:03,954
Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees,
which is good news for you reptiles...

35
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:08,083
and it looks like it's gonna be
a perfect day to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in...

36
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:12,671
or simply work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

37
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:15,299
Get up, Sulley!

38
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:19,219
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

39
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:22,139
Hey, less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy.

40
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,309
Feel the burn!
You call yourself a monster?

41
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,561
Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.
Oh, the kid's awake!

42
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:30,480
Okay, scary feet, scary feet, scary
feet, scary feet, scary... Kid's asleep!

43
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:34,192
Twins and a bunk bed!

44
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:38,447
Ooh, I thought I had you there.
Okay, Sulley, here we go.

45
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,117
You ready? Follow it.
Oh, it's over here. Oh, look over there.

46
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,536
Don't let the kid touch you!
Don't let it touch you!

47
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,040
<i>I don't know, but it's been said
I love scarin'kids in bed</i>

48
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:51,460
Come on, fight that plaque.
Fight that plaque.
Scary monsters don't have plaque.

49
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:55,672
118. Do you have 119?
Do I see 120?

50
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,342
- Oh, I don't believe it!
- I'm not even breaking a sweat.

51
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,678
Not you. Look!
The new commercial's on!

52
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,973
<i>The future is bright
at Monsters, Incorporated.</i>

53
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:07,559
<i>- I'm in this one! I'm in this one!
- We're part of your life.</i>

54
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:11,730
<i>We power your car. We warm your home.
We light your city.</i>

55
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:14,816
<i>- I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
- Hey, look! Betty!</i>

56
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,362
<i>Carefully matching every child
to their ideal monster...</i>

57
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,489
<i>to produce superior scream...</i>

58
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:23,533
<i>refined into clean,
dependable energy.</i>

59
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:28,038
<i>Every time you turn something on,
Monsters, Incorporated is there.</i>

60
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,708
<i>- I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
- We know the challenge.</i>

61
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:36,088
<i>The window of innocence is shrinking.
Human kids are harder to scare.</i>

62
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:38,799
<i>Of course, MI is prepared
for the future...</i>

63
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:42,678
<i>with the top scarers,
the best refineries...</i>

64
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:46,264
<i>and research
into new energy techniques.</i>

65
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:51,395
<i>- Okay, here I come.
- We're working for
a better tomorrow today!</i>

66
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,606
<i>We're Monsters, Incorporated!</i>

67
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,609
<i>We're MI, Monsters, Incorporated.</i>

68
00:06:57,693 --> 00:07:00,279
<i>We scare because we care.</i>

69
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,991
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, Mike.

70
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:06,493
I was on TV!

71
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:09,371
Ah, did you see me?
I'm a natural!

72
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:13,542
Hello? I know! Hey, wasn't I great?
Did the whole family see it?

73
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,920
It's your mom.
What can I say? The camera loves me.

74
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,436
I'm telling you, big daddy,
you're gonna be seeing this face
on TV a lot more often.

75
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,106
<i>Yeah?
Like on Monstropolis's Most Wanted?</i>

76
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,234
You've been jealous of my good looks
since the fourth grade, pal.

77
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:42,654
- Have a good day, sweetie.
- You too, hon.

78
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:45,741
- Ooh, okay, Sulley, hop on in.
- Nope. Uh-uh.

79
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:48,869
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going? What are you doing?
- Mikey, there's a scream shortage.

80
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:50,954
- We're walking.
- Walking?
- Yup.

81
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,416
- No. Hey, no, no. Come on.
- Come on.
- My baby, look... She needs to be driven.

82
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:56,835
Bye, baby! I... I'll call you!

83
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,088
Hey, genius, y-you wanna know
why I bought the car, huh?

84
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:03,675
- Not really.
- To drive it. You know,
like on the street...

85
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,136
with the honk-honk and the vroom-vroom
and no walking involved.

86
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,973
Give it a rest, will you, butterball?
Come on. You could use the exercise.

87
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,685
I could use the exercise? Look at you.
You-You-You have your own climate.

88
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,355
<i>How many tentacles jump the rope</i>

89
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:19,149
<i>- Morning, Mike! Morning, Sulley!
- One and two and three
- Hey, morning, kids!</i>

90
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:23,445
- Hey, kids.
- How you doin'?
- Bye, Mike! Bye, Sulley!

91
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:25,405
Hey!

92
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,789
Aw, nuts.

93
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:37,876
- Hey, hey, hey, fellas!
- Hey, Tony!
- Tony!

94
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,587
- Hey, hey! Tony!
- Tony!

95
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:44,007
I hear somebody's close to breaking
the all-time scare record.

96
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:48,011
Ah, just trying to make sure
there's enough scream to go around.

97
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,639
- Hey, on the house!
- Hey, thanks!

98
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,604
Oh, great.

99
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:00,941
Hey, Ted! Good morning!

100
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:05,821
See that, Mikey?
Ted's walking to work.

101
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:08,949
Big deal. Guy takes five steps
and he's there.

102
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:20,252
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

103
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:22,337
- Morning, Sulley.
- Morning, Ricky.

104
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:25,007
- Hey, it's the Sullster.
- See you on the scare floor, buddy.

105
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,677
- Hey, Marge. Hey, how was jury duty?
- Morning, Sulley!
- Hey!

106
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:32,973
- Hey, it's still leaning to the left.
- It is not!

107
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:36,727
- Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Mr Sullivan!

108
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,813
Guys, I told ya...
call me Sulley.

109
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:43,191
- I don't think so.
- We just wanted to
wish you good luck today.

110
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:46,653
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.

111
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,031
- Oh. Sorry.
- See you later, fellas.

112
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:51,325
- Go get 'em, Mr Sullivan.
- Quiet!

113
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:56,121
- You're making him lose his focus.
- Oh, no. Sorry!
- Shut up!

114
00:09:56,204 --> 00:10:00,000
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you.

115
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,045
Ms Fearmonger is on vacation.
Would you like her voice mail?

116
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:05,505
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo!

117
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:07,424
Googley Bear!

118
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:11,511
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Googley-woogley, you remembered!

119
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:15,849
- Hey, Sulley-wulley.
- Oh, hey, Celia-weelia.

120
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:18,143
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

121
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:21,271
So, uh, are we going
anywhere special tonight?

122
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:26,193
I-I just got us into a little place
called, um, Harryhausen's.

123
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:30,322
Harryhausen's? But it's impossible
to get a reservation there.

124
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:34,660
Not for Googley Bear. I will see you
at quittin' time and not a minute later.

125
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:37,704
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Think romantical thoughts.

126
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:39,790
<i>You and me</i>

127
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,627
<i>Me and you
Both of us together</i>

128
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:48,465
- You know, pal, she's the one.
That's it. She is the one.
- I'm happy for you.

129
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:51,176
Oh, and, uh, thanks for hooking me up
with those reservations.

130
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:54,012
Oh, no problem.
They're under the name "Googley Bear."

131
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:57,307
Oh, good ide...
You know, that wasn't very funny.

132
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,980
- What the...
- Wazowski!

133
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,361
What do you know? It scares
little kids and little monsters.

134
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:15,492
- I wasn't scared. I have allergies.
- Uh-huh, sure.
- Hey, Randall.

135
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:19,079
- Save it for the scare floor, will you?
- I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.

136
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:23,083
Gonna be doing some serious scaring,
putting up some big numbers.

137
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:27,713
Wow, Randall. That's great. That
should make it even more humiliating
when we break the record first.

138
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:34,136
Do you hear that?
It's the winds of change.

139
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:39,641
"You hear it? You hear
the winds of ch..." What a creep.

140
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:44,605
One of these days I am really
gonna let you teach that guy a lesson.

141
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,780
Chalooby baby.

142
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:58,535
Good morning, Roz,
my succulent little garden snail.

143
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,997
- And who would we be scaring today?
- Wazowski.

144
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,625
You didn't file
your paperwork last night.

145
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:09,921
Oh, that darn paperwork. Wouldn't
it be easier if it all just blew away?

146
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:13,967
Don't let it happen again.

147
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:17,471
Yes, well, I'll, uh,
I'll try to be less careless.

148
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:19,890
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

149
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,975
Always watching.

150
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:25,103
- Ooh, she's nuts.
- Always!

151
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:27,940
<i>All scare floors are now active.</i>

152
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:31,068
<i>Assistants,
please report to your stations.</i>

153
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:20,867
Okay, people,
Eastern Seaboard coming on-line.

154
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,869
We got scarers coming out!

155
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:39,720
Ooh, they're so awesome!

156
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:29,394
Hey, may the best monster win.

157
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:31,480
I plan to.

158
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:35,025
We are on in seven, six...

159
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:39,446
five, four, three, two...

160
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:48,538
You're the boss. You're the boss.
You're the big, hairy boss.

161
00:14:56,588 --> 00:15:00,509
Oh, I'm feelin' good today, Mikey!
Yeah!

162
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:04,888
Oh! That-a-boy, that-a-boy.
Another door comin' right up.

163
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:15,148
You're still behind, Randall.
You know, maybe I should realign
the scream intake valve...

164
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:17,442
- Just get me another door!
- A door! Yes! Door!

165
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,721
Well, Jerry,
what's the damage so far?

166
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:48,307
We may actually make
our quota today, sir.

167
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,934
First time in a month.

168
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,652
- What happened?
- The kid almost touched me.

169
00:16:00,736 --> 00:16:04,906
- She got this close to me.
- She wasn't scared of you?
She was only six!

170
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,577
I could have been dead!
I could have died!

171
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,079
Keep it together, man.

172
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:13,707
Hey, we got a dead door over here!

173
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,251
- We're coming! Look out!
- Coming! Back away!

174
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:18,337
Excuse us!

175
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:23,425
We've lost 58 doors this week, sir.

176
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:28,472
Oh, kids these days. They just
don't get scared like they used to.

177
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,557
Let 'er rip!

178
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,779
- Sir?
- What?

179
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:46,490
Look.

180
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:51,119
<i>Attention. We have a new scare leader...
Randall Boggs.</i>

181
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:54,498
Look at those numbers!

182
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:02,756
Slumber party.

183
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:07,844
<i>- Never mind.
- Hey, watch it!</i>

184
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:13,600
Well, James,
that was an impressive display.

185
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:16,061
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr Waternoose.

186
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:19,189
Of course, I did learn
from the best.

187
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:22,067
If I don't see a new door
at my station in five seconds...

188
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,821
I will personally
put you through the shredder!

189
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:30,284
Hey, Wazowski, nice job.
Those numbers are pretty sweet.

190
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,036
Are they? You know,
I hadn't even noticed.

191
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,789
- And, uh, how is Georgie doin'?
- He's doing great.

192
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:38,125
I love working
with that big guy.

193
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,377
Keep the doors comin', Charlie.
I'm on a roll today.

194
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,088
George and I are like brothers...

195
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:46,008
23-19! We have a 23-19!

196
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:55,517
<i>Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!
Red alert! Red alert!</i>

197
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,937
<i>George Sanderson,
please remain motionless.</i>

198
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:01,440
<i>- Prepare for decontamination.
- Get it off! Get it off!</i>

199
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:03,775
Duck and cover, people!

200
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:09,406
Oh, not the CD A!

201
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,124
- Move! Move! Move!
- Coming through, please. Step aside.

202
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,460
Clear the contaminated area.

203
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:25,464
- We have a 23-19 in progress.
- Keep the area clear.
- Coming through. Watch your step.

204
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:32,054
Stand back. Careful.

205
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:51,114
All clear. Situation is
niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.

206
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,492
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.

207
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,577
Okay.

208
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,381
Okay, people, take a break.

209
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:09,925
We gotta shut down for a half hour
and reset the system.

210
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:14,680
An entire scare floor out of commission.
What else can go wrong?

211
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:18,433
Oh, what a day.

212
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:22,521
We're just going through
a rough time, sir. Everyone knows
you're gonna get us through it.

213
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:26,066
Tell that
to the board of directors.

214
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:30,654
James, this company has been
in my family for three generations.

215
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,949
I would do anything
to keep it from going under.

216
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:36,451
- Well, so would I, sir.
- Well...

217
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:40,455
- Say, I could use
your help with something.
- Anything, sir.

218
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:45,669
You see, we've hired some new
scare recruits, and, frankly,
they're... they're, um, uh...

219
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,797
- Inexperienced?
- Oh, they stink!

220
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,218
I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow and,
uh, give them a demonstration...

221
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:56,346
show them what it takes
to be our top scarer, huh?

222
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,225
I'll start out with
the old Waternoose jump-and-growl.

223
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:04,813
Oh, yes, now, that's my boy!

224
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:16,283
Let's go, everybody. All doors
must be returned. No exceptions!

225
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,749
- Oh, yeah.
- I've never seen anything
like you today.

226
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:28,128
- You were on a roll, my man.
- Another day like this,
and that scare record's in the bag.

227
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:31,632
That's right, baby.

228
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:37,512
So get this. As if dinner
wasn't enough, I'm taking her to
a monster truck rally afterwards.

229
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:39,598
- Nice.
- What's on your agenda?

230
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:41,683
- I'm gonna head home
and work out some more.
- Again?

231
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:44,186
You know, there's more to life
than scaring.

232
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:46,271
Ooh.
Hey, can I borrow your odorant?

233
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:50,734
Yeah, I got, uh, Smelly Garbage
or Old Dumpster.

234
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,320
- You got, uh, Low Tide?
- No.
- How about Wet Dog?

235
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:55,405
Yep. Stink it up.

236
00:20:57,658 --> 00:21:00,702
You know, I am so romantic sometimes
I think I should just marry myself.

237
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:03,872
- Give me a break, Mike.
- What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.

238
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:07,584
Tonight is about me and Celia.

239
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:11,588
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.

240
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:15,592
'Cause I gotta tell you,
buddy, that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

241
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,678
Hello, Wazowski.

242
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:21,223
- Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?
- Well, as a matter of fact...

243
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:26,311
Then I'm sure you filed
your paperwork correctly for once.

244
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:30,857
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

245
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,360
Oh, no, my scare reports.
I left them on my desk.

246
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:37,155
And if I'm not at the restaurant
in five minutes, they're gonna give
our table away. What am I gonna tell...

247
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:40,075
- Schmoopsie-poo.
- Hey, Googley Bear. Want to get going?

248
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,411
- Uh, do I ever. It's just that...
- What?

249
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:44,913
- You know, it... There's a small...
- I don't understand.

250
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:47,916
- It's just that...
- I-It's just that I forgot about
some paperwork I was supposed to file.

251
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,086
Mike was reminding me.
Thanks, buddy.

252
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,213
I was? I mean, I was.
Yeah. I was.

253
00:21:53,297 --> 00:21:55,590
- Oh. Okay. Let's go, then.
- We're going.

254
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:58,927
On my desk, Sulley.
The pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing...

255
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:01,471
and the goldenrod ones go to Roz.

256
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,765
Leave the puce.

257
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:08,604
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.

258
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:12,941
No, the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing,
the goldenrod ones go to Roz...

259
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,527
Man, I have no idea what puce is.

260
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:20,574
Oh, that's puce.

261
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:29,333
Uh, hello! Anyone?

262
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,794
There's a door here.

263
00:22:51,355 --> 00:22:53,357
Hello. Hey.

264
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,693
Psst. Anybody scaring in here?

265
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:59,196
Hello. Yo.

266
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:52,976
Kitty!

267
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,812
No, no, stay back!

268
00:25:57,332 --> 00:25:59,334
Hold it, hold it.

269
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:12,639
Oh, Michael, I've had a lot of birthda...
Well, not a lot of birthdays.

270
00:26:12,723 --> 00:26:16,184
But this is the best birthday ever.

271
00:26:16,268 --> 00:26:18,395
What are you looking at?

272
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:22,649
Oh, I was just thinking about
the first time I laid eye on you,
how pretty you looked.

273
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:25,360
- Stop it.
- Your hair was shorter then.

274
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:29,948
- I'm thinking about getting it cut.
- No, no, I-I like it this length.

275
00:26:30,032 --> 00:26:32,034
I like everything about you.

276
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:35,996
Just the other day, someone asked me
who I thought the most beautiful
monster was in all of Monstropolis.

277
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,374
- Do you know what I said?
- What did you say?
- I said...

278
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,961
- Sulley?
- Sulley?
- No! No, no.

279
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:45,380
- That's not what I
was gonna say! I mean...
- Mike, you're not making sense.

280
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:47,633
- Sure, he's handsome,
I mean, for like a big, rugged...
- Hi, guys.

281
00:26:47,716 --> 00:26:49,926
What a coincidence
running into you here. Uh...

282
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,346
- I'm just gonna order something to go.
- Michael.
- Sulley.

283
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:55,265
- Uh, I wonder what's good here.
- Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.

284
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:58,602
- I went back to get your paperwork,
and there was a door.
- What?

285
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,732
- A door?
- Randall was in it.

286
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:07,027
Wait a minute. Randall? That cheater.
He's trying to boost his numbers.

287
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,112
- There's something else.
- What?

288
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:14,034
- What?
- Look in the bag.

289
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:16,286
What bag?

290
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:26,046
- They don't have anything I like here!
So take care, Celia!
- Excuse me, sir.

291
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:30,258
- Michael, what's going on?
- Celia, please try to understand.

292
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:32,928
- I have to do something!
- Michael!

293
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:36,807
- Oh, that's good.
- On three. One, two...

294
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:40,894
- A kid!
- Boo!

295
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,735
A kid!

296
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:52,281
There's a kid here!
A human kid!

297
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,743
Googley Bear!

298
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,669
Come on!

299
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,132
Let's get outta here!

300
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:12,759
<i>Please remain calm.
This is not a drill.</i>

301
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,390
78-35 in progress.
Please advise.

302
00:28:18,473 --> 00:28:22,019
- Michael? Michael!
- Celia!
- Please come with me.

303
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:24,813
- Stop pushing.
- Hey, get your hands
off my Schmoopsie-poo!

304
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:27,941
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.

305
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:31,069
Well, I don't think that date
could've gone any worse.

306
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:41,121
<i>If witnesses are to be believed, there
has been a child security breach...</i>

307
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:43,206
<i>for the first time
in monster history.</i>

308
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,002
<i>We can neither confirm nor deny the
presence of a human child here tonight.</i>

309
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:51,214
<i>Well, a kid flew right over me
and blasted a car with its laser vision.</i>

310
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:55,802
<i>I tried to run from it,
but it picked me up with its mind
powers and shook me like a doll.</i>

311
00:28:55,886 --> 00:28:58,096
<i>It's true!
I saw the whole thing!</i>

312
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,599
<i>It is my professional opinion...</i>

313
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:04,061
<i>that now is the time to panic.</i>

314
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:09,858
Oh, it's coming! It's coming!

315
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:13,028
Boo!

316
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,829
Come here, kid!

317
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:27,292
No, don't touch those,
you little...

318
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:30,212
Now, those were alphabetized.
It's okay. It's all right.

319
00:29:30,295 --> 00:29:33,423
As long as it doesn't come near us,
we're gonna be okay.

320
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:45,852
Oh, y-you like this? Fetch!

321
00:29:47,604 --> 00:29:50,649
Hey, hey, that's it!
No one touches little Mikey.

322
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:54,903
Mike, give her the bear.

323
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:59,449
Oh, no.

324
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:14,548
Make it stop, Sulley!
Make it stop!

325
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:18,010
Here, look. Here, see the bear?
Here. Ooh, nice bear.

326
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:20,345
Sulley!

327
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:23,307
Ooh, bear! Ooh!
Ooh, he's a happy bear!

328
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:27,519
And he's not crying, and neither
should you, or we'll be in trouble
'cause they're gonna find us.

329
00:30:27,603 --> 00:30:30,272
So please stop crying right now.

330
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:34,192
- Good. Good, Sulley.
Keep it up. You're doing great.
- I'm a happy bear, yeah.

331
00:30:35,986 --> 00:30:38,739
- Oh, she touched me! It touched me!
- Sulley, the bear!

332
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:40,907
The bear! Give me the...

333
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,545
What was that?

334
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:58,675
I have no idea, but it would be
really great if it didn't do it again.

335
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:21,990
How could I do this?
How could I be so stupid?

336
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:25,744
- This could destroy the company.
- The company?
Who cares about the company?

337
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:28,705
What about us?
That thing is a killing machine!

338
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:33,710
I bet it's just waiting for us
to fall asleep, and then wham!

339
00:31:33,794 --> 00:31:37,839
Oh, we're easy prey, my friend.
Easy prey. We're sitting targets.

340
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:40,050
Okay, look,
I think I have a plan here.

341
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:43,303
Using mainly spoons,
we dig a tunnel under the city...

342
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:45,889
and release it into the wild.

343
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,975
Spoons.

344
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:50,644
That's it. I'm out of ideas.
We're closed.

345
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,063
Hot air balloon? Too expensive.
Giant slingshot? Too conspicuous.

346
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:55,857
Enormous wooden horse? Too Greek.

347
00:31:58,026 --> 00:32:03,532
No plan. I can't think.
Can't think. Flatlining.

348
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:07,327
- Flatlining.
- Uh, Mike, I think she's getting tired.

349
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:11,206
Well, then why don't you find
someplace for it to sleep...

350
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,543
while I think of a plan!

351
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:19,506
Are you sleepy? You want to sleep?
Is that what you want?

352
00:32:34,104 --> 00:32:37,149
Okay. All right. I'm making
a nice little area for you to...

353
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:40,444
No. Hey, hey. That's my bed.
You're gonna get your germs all over it.

354
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,033
Fine. My chair's
more comfortable anyway.

355
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:49,828
What?

356
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,665
It's just a closet.
Will you go to sleep?

357
00:32:57,502 --> 00:33:00,130
Hey, that looks like Randall.

358
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:02,633
Randall's your monster.

359
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:05,344
You think he's gonna come
through the closet and scare you.

360
00:33:05,427 --> 00:33:09,056
Oh, boy. How do I explain this?
Uh, it's empty.

361
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:12,309
See?
No monster in here.

362
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:20,067
Well, now there is, but, uh,
l-I'm not gonna scare you.

363
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,361
I'm off duty.

364
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:31,119
Okay. How about I sit here
until you fall asleep?

365
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:36,875
Go ahead. Uh, go to sleep. Now.

366
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:39,252
Now. Go.

367
00:33:39,336 --> 00:33:42,714
Uh, you go...

368
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:44,800
to sleep.

369
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,920
Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy,
but I don't think that kid's dangerous.

370
00:34:22,004 --> 00:34:24,965
Really?
Well, in that case let's keep it.

371
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:27,676
- I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!
- Now, look.

372
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:30,012
- What if we just
put her back in her door?
- What?

373
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:33,140
Mike, think about it. If we send her
back, it's like it never happened.

374
00:34:33,223 --> 00:34:37,936
- Everything goes back to normal.
- Is that a joke? Tell me you're joking.

375
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,230
Sulley, I'd like to think
that given the circumstances...

376
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:43,692
I've been extremely forgiving up to now,
but that is a horrible idea.

377
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:47,321
What are we gonna do, march
right out into public with that thing?

378
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:49,906
Then we just waltz right up
to the factory, right?

379
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:54,745
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.

380
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:59,041
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights
and some chair fabric
are not gonna fool anyone.

381
00:34:59,124 --> 00:35:02,794
Just think about a few names,
will ya? Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman.

382
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:05,505
They all got one thing
in common, pal: Banishment.

383
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:08,258
- We could be next!
- Don't panic. We can do this.

384
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:10,469
- Hey, how you doin', Frank?
- Hey, guys.

385
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:13,722
Everything's going to be okay.

386
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:20,812
- Number One wants
this place dusted for prints.
- Careful with that.

387
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:24,441
- I got a good view from here.
- A little lower.

388
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:26,568
This was recovered at the scene.

389
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:28,654
- Don't panic. Don't panic.
- Don't tell me not to panic.

390
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:31,657
- Just keep it together. Stay cool.
- Everything is not okay. It's not okay.
- Boo!

391
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,077
- Could be contaminated.
- Gentlemen, safety is
our number-one concern.

392
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,163
- Now, if there's anything that...
- Boo.
- No, not now, not now, and...

393
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:41,541
Oh, hello, little one.
Where did you come from?

394
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,211
- Mr Waternoose!
- Ah, James, is this one yours?

395
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:48,215
Uh, actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's, uh, daughter, sir.

396
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:52,177
Yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh,
Bring An Obscure Relative To Work Day.

397
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:54,263
Must've missed the memo.

398
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:58,141
Well, listen, James, why don't you stop
by the simulator after lunch today...

399
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:01,270
and give us that scare demonstration
we talked about, huh?

400
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:03,814
- Yeah...
Oh! Oh, sir, uh, today might be...
- Excuse me, Mr Waternoose.

401
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:07,818
Yes, yes, I'm coming. All right, then.
I'll see you this afternoon, James.

402
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:10,946
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

403
00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:14,658
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, a scare demo. Well, that is great.
Why am I the last to know?

404
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:19,037
We can bring your cousin's sister's
daughter along. She'll be a big hit.

405
00:36:19,121 --> 00:36:21,832
Halt! Stop him!

406
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:23,959
Hold him down.

407
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:31,591
Come on. The coast is clear. Okay, all
we have to do is get rid of that thing.

408
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:33,677
So wait here while
I get its card key.

409
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,264
But she can't stay here.
This is the men's room.

410
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:40,434
That is the weirdest thing you have
ever said. It's fine. It's okay.

411
00:36:40,517 --> 00:36:44,229
Look, it loves it here.
It's dancing with joy.

412
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:46,315
I'll be right back
with its door key.

413
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:51,987
That's a cute little dance you've got.
That almost looks like you gotta...

414
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:09,254
Uh, are you done in there?

415
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:12,841
Sorry. Sorry.

416
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:29,858
Okay, you finished now, right?
Hello.

417
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,822
Boo!

418
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:47,501
Where did she go?

419
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:49,586
Did she disappear?

420
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,755
Did she turn invisible?

421
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:55,092
I just have no idea.

422
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:59,471
- Gotcha!
- Boo!

423
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,017
Hey, you're good.

424
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,235
Be relaxed, be relaxed,
be relaxed.

425
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:16,780
Roz, my tender, oozing blossom,
you're looking fabulous today.

426
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:20,242
Is that a new haircut? Come on, tell me.
It's a new haircut, isn't it?

427
00:38:20,325 --> 00:38:23,787
It's got to be a new haircut.
New make-up. You've had a lift, you've
had a tuck, you've had something.

428
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,957
Something has been inserted
in your skin that makes you look like...

429
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,672
Listen, I need a favour.
Randall was working late last night
out on the scare floor.

430
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:36,216
I really need the key
for the door he was using.

431
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,595
Well, isn't that nice?

432
00:38:39,678 --> 00:38:43,557
But guess what. You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

433
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,603
- He didn't... I... No p-paperwork?
- This office is now closed.

434
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:56,445
Ready or not, here I come.
I'm getting warmer. Any second now.

435
00:38:56,528 --> 00:38:59,072
Fee, fi, fo...

436
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:02,451
- What are you doing?
- I-I'm-I'm looking for the kid.

437
00:39:02,534 --> 00:39:05,495
- You lost it?
- No, no. She was just, uh...

438
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,291
Here she is...
Hey, what's the matter?

439
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:14,630
- Look, I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.
- All right. Carry on.

440
00:39:25,557 --> 00:39:28,435
Randall, thank goodness!
What are we gonna do about the child?

441
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:30,938
Will you... shh!

442
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:53,585
The front page! It's on the front page.
The child, the one you were after!

443
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:56,797
Will you be quiet? Don't you think
I'm aware of the situation?

444
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,091
I was up all night trying to find it.

445
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:04,930
I-I did a simple calculation, factoring
in the size of the sushi restaurant.
The child may have escaped!

446
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:08,517
Yeah, well, until we know
for sure, we're gonna act like
nothing happened, understand?

447
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,645
You just get the machine up and running.
I'll take care of the kid.

448
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:15,399
And when I find whoever let it out,
they're dead!

449
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:19,820
- Why are you still here?
Come on, go! Move! Now!
- Oh. Yes, go, go, go!

450
00:40:19,903 --> 00:40:22,364
Now, now, now, now!
I'm not here!

451
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:24,449
They're gone.

452
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:30,580
This is bad.
This is so very bad.

453
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:33,375
- What were they
talking about, a machine?
- Who cares?

454
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:36,837
Look, don't panic.
All we have to do is call
her door down and send her home.

455
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,425
You're right. You're right.
We're just two regular Joes on our way
to work. We will blend right in.

456
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:44,344
- Top of the mornin', fellas.
- Hey, what's shakin', bacon?

457
00:40:44,428 --> 00:40:46,638
Did you lose weight?
Or a limb?

458
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:50,559
- You have her card key, right?
- Of course I have her card key.
I told you I'd get her card key.

459
00:40:50,642 --> 00:40:54,104
I went and got her card key,
and now I have her card key.

460
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,357
Okay, here we go.

461
00:40:57,441 --> 00:41:02,070
Take care of yourself.
Try not to run through any more closets.

462
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:07,701
- Mike, that's not her door.
- What are you talking about?
Of course it's her door. It's her door.

463
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:10,203
- No, her door was white.
- No.
- And it had flowers on it.

464
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:14,583
No. It must have been dark last night,
because this is its door.

465
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:18,795
Hey, you hear that? Sounds like fun
in there. Okay, send me a postcard, kid.

466
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:24,551
That's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 "Mike
Wazowski, You Got Your Life Back" Lane.

467
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:27,804
Very good. Now, bon voyage.
Bye-bye! Come on!

468
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:31,642
Look at the stick. See the stick?
Go get the stick. Go fetch.

469
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:35,020
- Mike, this isn't Boo's door.
- Boo? What's Boo?

470
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:38,190
That's what I decided to call her.
Is there a problem?

471
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:40,275
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.

472
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:42,945
Once you name it,
you start getting attached to it.

473
00:41:43,028 --> 00:41:47,449
Now, put that thing back
where it came from, or so help me...

474
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,207
Oh, hey, we're rehearsing a-a scene for
the upcoming company play called, uh...

475
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,751
<i>Put That Thing Back Where It Came From,
Or So Help Me.</i>

476
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:02,839
<i>It's a musical. Yeah.
Put that thing back where it came from
or so help me</i>

477
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:05,634
<i>So help me, so help me
And cut!</i>

478
00:42:05,717 --> 00:42:09,513
We're still working on it. It's a work
in progress, but, hey, we need ushers.

479
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:12,140
Sulley, I've had enough.
Now say goodbye to...

480
00:42:12,224 --> 00:42:14,601
- Where'd it go? What'd you do with it?
- Where is she?

481
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:16,687
- I don't believe it.
She got away from you again?
- Boo!

482
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,231
Well, that is just... Wait a minute.

483
00:42:19,314 --> 00:42:24,236
The sun is coming up.
This is perfect. She's gone!

484
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,530
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going? Sulley, please.

485
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:29,032
Don't blow this, not when we're
so close to breaking the record!

486
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:31,702
Come on,
somebody else will find the kid.
It'll be their problem, not ours.

487
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:34,621
She's out of our hair!

488
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:37,791
- What are you two doing?
- They're rehearsing a play.

489
00:42:37,874 --> 00:42:42,254
<i>- She's out of our hair
- Can it, Wazowski.</i>

490
00:42:42,337 --> 00:42:45,215
So what do you think of that kid getting
out, Sullivan? Pretty crazy, huh?

491
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:47,134
Oh, yeah. Crazy.

492
00:42:47,217 --> 00:42:49,636
Word on the street is the kid's
been traced back to this factory.

493
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,264
- You haven't seen anything, have you?
- Uh, well, uh...

494
00:42:52,347 --> 00:42:54,349
No. No way.

495
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:58,353
But if it was an inside job,
uh, I-I'd put my money on Waxford.

496
00:42:58,437 --> 00:43:01,940
- Waxford?
- Yeah, the one on station six.
You know, he's got them shifty eyes.

497
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:04,651
- Hey, Waxford!
- Sulley!

498
00:43:04,735 --> 00:43:07,863
Michael Wazowski!

499
00:43:09,114 --> 00:43:13,243
Last night was one of the worst nights
of my entire life, bar none.

500
00:43:15,454 --> 00:43:18,248
- I thought you cared about me.
- Honey, please, Schmoopsie.

501
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:21,710
- I thought you liked sushi.
- Sushi? Sushi?

502
00:43:21,793 --> 00:43:25,380
- You think this is about sushi?
- Schmoopsie!

503
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:34,264
- Wazowski!
- Michael! Mi... Men!

504
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,685
Breathe. Keep breathing.

505
00:43:48,904 --> 00:43:51,990
- Where's the kid?
- Kid? What kid?

506
00:43:52,074 --> 00:43:55,410
- It's here in the factory, isn't it?
- You're not pinning this on me.

507
00:43:55,494 --> 00:43:58,080
It never would've gotten out
if you hadn't been cheating last night.

508
00:43:58,163 --> 00:44:00,165
Cheating?

509
00:44:00,248 --> 00:44:02,584
Cheating. Right.

510
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:06,213
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.

511
00:44:06,296 --> 00:44:10,092
What happens when the whistle blows
in five minutes?

512
00:44:10,175 --> 00:44:15,097
- Uh, I get a timeout?
- Everyone goes to lunch.

513
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,892
Which means
the scare floor will be...

514
00:44:20,477 --> 00:44:22,479
- Painted?
- Empty!

515
00:44:22,562 --> 00:44:26,233
It'll be empty, you idiot!
You see that clock?

516
00:44:26,316 --> 00:44:30,612
When the big hand is pointing up
and the little hand is pointing up...

517
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:33,240
the kid's door
will be in my station.

518
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:36,535
But when the big hand points down...

519
00:44:36,618 --> 00:44:38,704
the door will be gone.

520
00:44:38,787 --> 00:44:43,000
You have until then to put the kid back.
Get the picture?

521
00:44:54,803 --> 00:44:57,306
Boo! No!

522
00:44:57,389 --> 00:45:00,642
- Hey, you! Halt! He's the one.
- Uh...

523
00:45:00,726 --> 00:45:03,228
- The one from the commercial.
- Affirmative. That's him.

524
00:45:03,312 --> 00:45:06,481
- Can we get an autograph?
- Ohh! Oh, sure. No problem.

525
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:09,359
If you could make that out
to Stephanie, my daughter.

526
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:14,197
Yes. Let's see.
From your scary friend, best wishes.

527
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:18,535
So I said, "If you talk to me
like that again, we're through!"

528
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:22,706
- What'd she say?
- You know my mom.
She sent me to my room.

529
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:26,710
- See you guys later. Take it easy.
- Thanks a lot.
- Bottoms up.

530
00:45:42,851 --> 00:45:44,853
Boo!

531
00:45:49,024 --> 00:45:51,318
Hey.

532
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:54,738
Oh! Well, hello there.
What's your name?

533
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:56,615
Mike Wazowski!

534
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:39,032
Sulley! Oh! Sulley.

535
00:46:40,158 --> 00:46:42,828
Okay, Sulley, come on, come on.

536
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:45,747
- Hey, you guys seen Sulley anywhere?
- Nope. Sorry.

537
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:49,626
- Oh, Sulley!
- Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.

538
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:54,298
- 23-19! We have a 23-19!
- Halt!

539
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:57,384
- Oh, dear.
- Get him!

540
00:46:57,467 --> 00:47:00,345
Sulley! Sulley!

541
00:47:03,265 --> 00:47:05,559
Sulley! Oh! Great news, pal!

542
00:47:05,642 --> 00:47:09,938
I got us a way out of this mess,
but we gotta hurry. Where is it?

543
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:16,111
Sull, that's a cube of garbage.

544
00:47:16,194 --> 00:47:19,406
I-I can still hear her little voice.

545
00:47:19,489 --> 00:47:21,950
- Mike Wazowski!
- Hey, I can hear her too.

546
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:24,661
- Mike Wazowski!
- Mike Wazowski!
- How many kids you got in there?

547
00:47:24,745 --> 00:47:27,789
- Mike Wazowski!
- Mike Wazowski!

548
00:47:27,873 --> 00:47:29,875
- Kitty!
- Boo!

549
00:47:31,376 --> 00:47:35,339
Boo, are you all right?
I was so worried! I was...

550
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:38,717
Don't you ever run away
from me again, young lady.

551
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,470
Oh, but I'm so glad you're safe.

552
00:47:41,553 --> 00:47:45,349
Oh, my, what an affectionate father.

553
00:47:45,432 --> 00:47:47,768
Uh, actually, she's my, uh,
my cousin's sister's...

554
00:47:47,851 --> 00:47:50,938
- Okay, Sulley, that's enough. Let's go.
- Mike Wazowski!

555
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:53,065
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Step aside, kid. We're in a...

556
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:04,868
- Will you stop making Boo laugh!
- I didn't! Come on!

557
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:12,167
- I still don't understand.
You got Boo's door?
- I'll explain later. Run.

558
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,088
Okay, let's move, let's move, let's
move. Come on. Oh, please be there,
please be there, please be there.

559
00:48:16,171 --> 00:48:21,593
- There it is, just like Randall said.
- Randall? Wait a minute. Whoa. Hey.

560
00:48:21,677 --> 00:48:23,679
1-2-3-4, get the kid
back through the door.

561
00:48:23,762 --> 00:48:26,598
- Hey. Hey.
- We're gonna get our lives back.
The nightmare is over!

562
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:30,143
- Hey, it's okay, Boo.
- Hey, what's the matter?
Come on, it's time to move!

563
00:48:30,227 --> 00:48:33,188
Mike, what are you thinking?
We can't trust Randall. He's after Boo.

564
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:37,276
- Who cares? Let's go.
This is a limited-time offer.
- No, no. I don't like this.

565
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,821
Look, Sulley, you wanted her door,
and there it is. Now let's move.

566
00:48:41,947 --> 00:48:45,117
- No, Mike.
- You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up? Fine.

567
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,244
- He wants the door, I get the door.
He don't want the door.
- Mike, wait.

568
00:48:47,327 --> 00:48:49,496
He's a paranoid, delusional fur ball.

569
00:48:51,748 --> 00:48:53,750
Mike!

570
00:49:51,475 --> 00:49:54,311
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?

571
00:49:54,394 --> 00:49:56,396
Sulley? Sulley?

572
00:50:10,827 --> 00:50:13,372
Huh? Mike.

573
00:50:13,455 --> 00:50:15,540
Mike.

574
00:50:15,624 --> 00:50:18,877
Where are you?
Are you in there?

575
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:21,088
Where are you, buddy?

576
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:23,590
Mike, where are you?

577
00:50:34,476 --> 00:50:37,104
Boo, way to go!

578
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:46,613
It's okay.

579
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:07,050
Oh, Randall, did you take care
of that situation?

580
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:10,512
Yeah, of course I did. Let's get going.
We gotta make up for lost time.

581
00:51:10,596 --> 00:51:12,764
- You got the extra scream cans?
- Uh, right.

582
00:51:12,848 --> 00:51:17,019
- So to confirm, then, you did find the...
- Yes, I got the kid!

583
00:51:17,102 --> 00:51:19,688
Oh, huzzah! That's great news!

584
00:51:19,771 --> 00:51:23,025
- Not that I was concerned,
of course. I knew that...
- Just get over here and help me.

585
00:51:23,108 --> 00:51:26,862
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
While we're young here, Fungus.

586
00:51:29,948 --> 00:51:33,785
Kid needs to
take off a few pounds.

587
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,750
Wazowski! Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

588
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,961
Okay, first of all, it's cretin.
If you're gonna threaten me,
do it properly.

589
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:47,049
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me is gonna
help you cheat your way to the top.

590
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,888
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

591
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:56,975
Well, I did, right up until
you chuckled like that.

592
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:00,312
And, uh, now I'm thinkin'
I should just get out of here.

593
00:52:00,395 --> 00:52:04,274
I am about to revolutionize
the scaring industry, and when I do...

594
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:08,278
even the great James P. Sullivan
is gonna be working for me.

595
00:52:08,362 --> 00:52:11,490
Well, somebody's
certainly been a busy bee.

596
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:14,785
First I need to know where the kid is,
and you're gonna tell me.

597
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:16,870
- Yeah, I don't know anything.
- Uh-huh. Sure.

598
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:19,581
I-I don't. I mean, I don't.

599
00:52:19,665 --> 00:52:22,918
Uh-oh. What's that? Wait.

600
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:25,712
Come on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh! Oh, come on.

601
00:52:25,796 --> 00:52:27,923
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

602
00:52:28,006 --> 00:52:30,467
This thing is moving.

603
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,096
I don't like big moving things
that are moving towards me.

604
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:37,099
No, come on. Hey! Randall!

605
00:52:38,267 --> 00:52:41,103
Say hello
to the Scream Extractor.

606
00:52:41,186 --> 00:52:42,980
Hello.

607
00:52:43,063 --> 00:52:45,899
Come on. Where you going? We-We'll talk.
Come on, we'll have a latte.

608
00:52:45,983 --> 00:52:48,777
Come on! We can talk about this.

609
00:52:53,115 --> 00:52:57,035
What's that thing? What is that thing?
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no!

610
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,371
Oh! No, come on, guys!

611
00:53:00,998 --> 00:53:03,750
Help! Help! Help! Help!

612
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,926
Oh, for...
What did you do wrong this time?

613
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:16,597
- I-I don't know.
I calibrated the drive...
- Go check the machine!

614
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,266
Th-There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

615
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:22,269
Yeah, th-that's the problem
with these 32-50 units, boss.

616
00:53:22,352 --> 00:53:25,063
See, the old intake valve
is always the first thing to go.

617
00:53:25,147 --> 00:53:28,400
I-I told them this.

618
00:53:39,494 --> 00:53:41,496
Psst. Fungus. Fungus.

619
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,250
You like cars, huh?
'Cause I got a really nice car.

620
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:49,713
You let me go,
I'll give you a ride in the car.

621
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:52,090
- Please, Fungus?
- I'm sorry, Wazowski.

622
00:53:52,174 --> 00:53:56,219
But Randall said
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.

623
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,026
What happened?
Where's Wazowski?

624
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:16,782
Where is he?

625
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,790
- Come on.
- This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.

626
00:54:24,873 --> 00:54:28,585
- Careful with that.
Could be contaminated.
- We gotta get out of here now!

627
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:30,879
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.

628
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:34,132
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.
Goodbye, Mr Waternoose.

629
00:54:34,216 --> 00:54:36,885
- No, Mike. Wait.
- Hey, what are you doin'?

630
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:41,306
- Follow me. I have an idea.
- No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

631
00:54:41,473 --> 00:54:44,768
<i>- Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
- No, no, no, no, no.</i>

632
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:48,772
What was that? You're trying to
scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.

633
00:54:48,855 --> 00:54:54,152
I was going for a snake-slash-ninja
approach with a little hissing.

634
00:54:54,236 --> 00:54:56,530
Oh, how many times
do I have to tell you?

635
00:54:56,613 --> 00:55:00,951
It's all about presence,
about how you enter the room.

636
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:04,037
- Mr Waternoose!
- James. Perfect timing.

637
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:09,418
- No, no, no, sir, you don't understand.
- Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.
- What? No, no. I ca... I ca... Sir. Sir!

638
00:55:09,501 --> 00:55:11,545
- You have to listen to me.
- Pay attention, everyone.

639
00:55:11,628 --> 00:55:14,006
- You're about to see
the best in the business.
- Sir, I c...

640
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:16,883
- Reset the simulator.
- But, but, sir...

641
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:18,969
<i>- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.</i>

642
00:55:19,052 --> 00:55:20,470
<i>- Sleep tight, kiddo.
- Kitty!
- No, Boo. No, no!</i>

643
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:24,683
- Now, give us a big, loud roar.
- Mr Waternoose,
there's no time for this.

644
00:55:24,766 --> 00:55:27,436
- Come on, come on.
What are you waiting for? Roar!
- B-B-But, sir...

645
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:29,521
- Roar!
- Ohh.

646
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:43,702
- Well done. Well done, James.
- Boo?

647
00:55:43,785 --> 00:55:48,624
- All right, gentlemen.
- Right this way, everyone.
- I hope you've learned
a valuable lesson in scaring today.

648
00:55:52,294 --> 00:55:54,463
Boo?

649
00:55:57,507 --> 00:55:59,676
Boo?

650
00:56:03,972 --> 00:56:06,099
Boo, it's me.

651
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:12,856
- The child!
- Sir, she isn't toxic.
- What?
- I know it sounds crazy, but trust me.

652
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,026
- Sulley...
- Boo? No, no, no, no, it's okay.

653
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:18,403
I was just...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

654
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:23,617
No, don't be scared.
That wasn't real. It's just a...

655
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,911
I was just...

656
00:56:38,507 --> 00:56:42,636
- Boo.
- And he was gonna test it out
on that sweet little girl.

657
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:45,305
- Boo?
- Now that we have her,
he is trying to kill us.

658
00:56:45,389 --> 00:56:47,391
- This whole thing is Randall's fault.
- Randall?

659
00:56:47,474 --> 00:56:50,686
Yes, and we can take you
to his secret lab which is
right here in this factory.

660
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:55,691
How could this happen?
How could this happen?

661
00:56:55,774 --> 00:56:58,902
- Does anyone else know about this?
- No, sir.

662
00:56:58,986 --> 00:57:02,698
Good. This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

663
00:57:03,699 --> 00:57:06,118
Now, before we do anything else...

664
00:57:06,201 --> 00:57:09,371
let's take care of the child.

665
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:19,214
Oh, I never thought things would
come to this. Not in my factory.

666
00:57:19,298 --> 00:57:24,094
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up
in this, especially you, James.

667
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:29,433
But now we can set everything straight
again for the good of the company.

668
00:57:32,894 --> 00:57:37,190
- Uh, sir, that's not her door.
- I know, I know.

669
00:57:40,193 --> 00:57:41,987
It's yours.

670
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:47,951
No!

671
00:57:49,911 --> 00:57:52,331
Boo!

672
00:57:57,461 --> 00:58:01,632
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no!

673
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:07,721
It's too late! We're banished, genius.
We're in the human world!

674
00:58:07,804 --> 00:58:11,183
Oh, what a great idea,
going to your old pal Waternoose.

675
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:13,393
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!

676
00:58:13,477 --> 00:58:17,230
All you had to do was listen to me,
just once!

677
00:58:17,314 --> 00:58:20,150
But you didn't, did you?

678
00:58:20,233 --> 00:58:22,903
You're still not listening!

679
00:58:29,701 --> 00:58:31,703
Take that!

680
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:38,919
Welcome to the Himalayas!

681
00:58:42,297 --> 00:58:47,302
Abominable! Can you believe that?
Do I look abominable to you?

682
00:58:47,386 --> 00:58:53,058
Why can't they call me the Adorable
Snowman or, or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

683
00:58:53,141 --> 00:58:55,852
I'm a nice guy. Snow cone?

684
00:58:57,187 --> 00:58:59,606
No, no, no, don't worry.
It's lemon.

685
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:03,777
Uh, how 'bout you, big fella?
Snow cone?

686
00:59:05,362 --> 00:59:08,907
Did you see the way
she looked at me?

687
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:14,830
Ah, poor guy. I understand.
It ain't easy being banished.

688
00:59:14,913 --> 00:59:20,877
Uh, take my buddy Bigfoot.
When he was banished, he fashioned
an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.

689
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:24,590
Wore it on his head like a tiara.
Called himself King Itchy.

690
00:59:24,673 --> 00:59:28,302
It won't be so hard for you guys though,
you know. I mean, how lucky can you get?

691
00:59:28,385 --> 00:59:31,722
- Banished with your best friend.
- He is not my friend.

692
00:59:31,805 --> 00:59:35,642
Oh. I-I just assumed you were buddies,
you know, when I saw you out there
in the snow hugging and all, I...

693
00:59:35,726 --> 00:59:40,022
Look at that big jerk. Ruined my life,
and for what? A stupid kid!

694
00:59:40,105 --> 00:59:43,692
Because of you, I am now stuck
in this frozen wasteland!

695
00:59:43,775 --> 00:59:47,237
Wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland.

696
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:49,615
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?

697
00:59:49,698 --> 00:59:53,952
Oh, and wait till you see the local
village. Cutest thing in the world.

698
00:59:54,036 --> 00:59:56,330
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.

699
00:59:56,413 --> 00:59:58,915
- Wait. What did you say?
- Uh, yak's milk.

700
00:59:58,999 --> 01:00:01,126
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic...

701
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:03,587
but, you know, once you pick
the hairs out, it's very nutritious.

702
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,006
No, no, something about a village.
Where? Are there kids in it?

703
01:00:06,089 --> 01:00:09,718
Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks.

704
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:11,970
- Where is it?
- Ah, hey, hey!
It's at the bottom of the mountain.

705
01:00:12,054 --> 01:00:14,973
- Around a three-day hike.
- Oh! Three days?

706
01:00:15,057 --> 01:00:18,393
We need to get there now!

707
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:31,406
You want to go to the village?
Okay, rule number one out here.

708
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,951
Always... No.

709
01:00:34,034 --> 01:00:36,036
Never go out in a blizzard.

710
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:39,289
We need to get to Boo.

711
01:00:40,582 --> 01:00:43,460
Boo? What about us?

712
01:00:43,543 --> 01:00:46,546
Ever since that kid came in,
you've ignored everything I've said.

713
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,049
And now look where we are!

714
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:51,927
Oh, we were about to break
the record, Sulley.

715
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:54,513
- We would have had it made.
- None of that matters now.

716
01:00:56,098 --> 01:00:58,558
None of it matters?
W-W-Wait a second.

717
01:00:58,642 --> 01:01:00,686
None of it matters?

718
01:01:03,021 --> 01:01:06,191
Okay, that's, uh... No. Good. Great.

719
01:01:06,275 --> 01:01:08,568
So now the truth comes out,
doesn't it?

720
01:01:10,279 --> 01:01:13,073
Oh, would you look at that?
We're out of snow cones.

721
01:01:13,156 --> 01:01:16,785
Uh, let me just go outside
and make some more.

722
01:01:18,161 --> 01:01:22,040
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

723
01:01:22,124 --> 01:01:24,585
Does that matter, huh?

724
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:26,712
What about Celia?

725
01:01:26,795 --> 01:01:32,134
I am never... never gonna see her again.
Doesn't that matter?

726
01:01:37,723 --> 01:01:40,225
And what about me?

727
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:43,687
I'm your pal.
I'm-I'm-I'm your best friend.

728
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,231
Don't I matter?

729
01:01:48,483 --> 01:01:52,571
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

730
01:01:52,654 --> 01:01:57,159
I didn't mean for this to happen.
But Boo's in trouble.

731
01:01:57,242 --> 01:02:00,245
I think there might be a way to save her
if we can just get down to that...

732
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:03,081
We? Whoa, whoa, whoa. We?

733
01:02:03,165 --> 01:02:07,044
No, there's no "we" this time, pal.

734
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:10,881
I-If-If-If you want to go out there
and freeze to death...

735
01:02:10,964 --> 01:02:13,425
you be my guest...

736
01:02:13,508 --> 01:02:16,345
because you're on your own.

737
01:02:52,631 --> 01:02:55,217
Hey, I got more snow cones!

738
01:03:42,222 --> 01:03:45,183
Oh, come on now, George.
I know you can do this.

739
01:03:45,267 --> 01:03:48,687
I picked out an easy door for you
in Nepal.

740
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:50,772
Nice, quiet Nepal.

741
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:53,734
You know, you're right.
Here, take this.

742
01:03:53,817 --> 01:03:57,237
- Go get 'em, Georgie!
- Gangway! Look out! Comin' through!

743
01:03:57,321 --> 01:04:00,991
- Sorry, George.
- What the...
- Hey, you can't just...

744
01:04:01,074 --> 01:04:03,493
Twenty-three-nine...

745
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:10,667
- Out of the way!
- Hey!

746
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,545
Help!

747
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:18,050
Finally. I never should have
trusted you with this.

748
01:04:18,133 --> 01:04:20,802
Because of you,
I had to banish my top scarer.

749
01:04:20,886 --> 01:04:23,430
Ah, with this machine,
we won't need scarers.

750
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:25,557
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.

751
01:04:25,641 --> 01:04:28,602
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be.

752
01:04:42,741 --> 01:04:43,825
Kitty!

753
01:04:50,999 --> 01:04:53,835
- Kitty!
- Sullivan?

754
01:04:58,757 --> 01:05:01,218
- Kitty!
- Sorry, Boo.

755
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:03,845
Stop him!

756
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:06,348
Let's get you home.

757
01:05:09,142 --> 01:05:11,478
Finish him off!

758
01:05:17,985 --> 01:05:21,947
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do that, Sullivan!

759
01:05:34,334 --> 01:05:36,920
- Mike?
- Look, it's not that I don't
care about the kid.

760
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:40,173
- Mike, you don't understand.
- Yes, I do. I was just mad, that's all.

761
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:43,594
I needed some time to think. But
you shouldn't have left me out there.

762
01:05:45,387 --> 01:05:48,640
- I'm being attacked.
- No, I'm not attacking you.
I-I-I'm trying to be honest.

763
01:05:48,724 --> 01:05:51,310
Just hear me out.
Look, you and I are a team.

764
01:05:51,393 --> 01:05:53,729
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

765
01:05:53,812 --> 01:05:55,814
I-I-I know, kid.
He-He's too sensitive.

766
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,488
Come on, pal,
if you start crying I'm gonna cry
and I'll never get through this.

767
01:06:03,572 --> 01:06:06,908
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you,
but I am now.

768
01:06:06,992 --> 01:06:11,038
Hey, Sulley, I am baring my soul here.
The least you could do is pay attention.

769
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:18,003
Hey, look at that.
It's Randall. It's...

770
01:06:18,086 --> 01:06:20,881
- Oh.
- Come on!

771
01:06:20,964 --> 01:06:25,052
- Get up! There can't be any witnesses.
- There won't be.

772
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:30,182
- I'm glad you came back, Mike.
- Somebody's gotta take care you,
you big hair ball.

773
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:36,021
- Schmoopsie-poo, I really can't talk.
- Come on!

774
01:06:36,104 --> 01:06:39,733
Michael, if you don't tell me what's
going on right now, we are through!

775
01:06:39,816 --> 01:06:42,027
- Do you hear me? Through!
- Okay, here's the truth.

776
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,112
You know the kid that they're
looking for? Sulley let her in.

777
01:06:44,196 --> 01:06:46,531
We tried to send her back,
but Waternoose had this secret plot...

778
01:06:46,615 --> 01:06:48,992
and now Randall's right behind us,
and he's trying to kill us.

779
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:52,329
You expect me to believe
that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?

780
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:53,705
Mike Wazowski!

781
01:06:55,082 --> 01:06:59,419
- I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!
- Will you move it? Hey! Look out.

782
01:06:59,503 --> 01:07:01,296
Idiot!

783
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:04,174
- Look out.
Coming through here. Coming through.
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Make way. Move it!

784
01:07:04,258 --> 01:07:07,135
Hurry up. Hurry up.

785
01:07:07,219 --> 01:07:09,930
<i>- There they are!
- Attention, employees.</i>

786
01:07:10,013 --> 01:07:13,767
<i>Randall Boggs has just broken
the all-time scare record.</i>

787
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:17,604
Huh? No, I didn't.
Get out of my way! Let me go!

788
01:07:17,688 --> 01:07:20,816
Go get 'em, Googley Bear.

789
01:07:20,899 --> 01:07:24,653
- There it is!
- Get off my tail. Let me go!

790
01:07:28,573 --> 01:07:33,161
- Sulley, what are you doing?
- Grab on, Mike.
- Are you out of your mind?

791
01:07:42,963 --> 01:07:46,258
- Sulley, what are we doing?
- We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.

792
01:07:46,341 --> 01:07:49,845
What a plan.
Simple, yet insane!

793
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:05,861
- Whoa.
- Oh, boy.
- Hold on!

794
01:08:14,202 --> 01:08:15,996
- Wow!
- Don't look down!

795
01:08:32,846 --> 01:08:35,933
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

796
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:40,979
Oh, no!

797
01:08:43,857 --> 01:08:46,234
No!

798
01:08:46,318 --> 01:08:48,695
- Boo's door!
- There it is!

799
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:51,323
How are we supposed
to get to it now?

800
01:08:54,326 --> 01:08:58,497
Oh, it's a dead end, Sulley.
There he is.

801
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,874
- Make her laugh!
- What? Sulley!
- Just do it!

802
01:09:01,959 --> 01:09:03,794
Ow!

803
01:09:10,884 --> 01:09:13,095
- Get it open!
- Here he comes.

804
01:09:13,178 --> 01:09:15,264
Give me that kid!

805
01:09:19,768 --> 01:09:23,605
- Why couldn't we get banished here?
- Come on. We gotta find another door.

806
01:09:29,278 --> 01:09:31,029
Look! Boo's door!

807
01:09:35,617 --> 01:09:39,162
- There he is. Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Give me your hand.

808
01:09:45,002 --> 01:09:47,629
- Come on. It slides, it slides.
- Ooh, right, right, right.

809
01:09:51,675 --> 01:09:54,386
Jump! I'm right behind you.

810
01:09:58,473 --> 01:10:00,183
Come on!

811
01:10:01,852 --> 01:10:04,605
- Hurry up! Keep moving!
- Get inside!

812
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:08,275
That was weird.

813
01:10:08,358 --> 01:10:10,485
Mike? Ooh, sorry, buddy.

814
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:21,330
I hope that hurt, lizard boy.

815
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:29,129
Great job, buddy.
We lost him.

816
01:10:29,212 --> 01:10:31,006
Boo!

817
01:10:34,509 --> 01:10:36,261
Nice workin' with ya!

818
01:10:36,345 --> 01:10:40,557
- Get it open!
- I'm trying!
- Open the door!
- Come on! Get in here!

819
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:52,861
Boo!

820
01:10:55,072 --> 01:10:57,240
There they are!

821
01:11:00,494 --> 01:11:03,330
Sulley, what are you doing?
Sulley!

822
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:10,212
- Looks like we caught the express, pal!
- Do you see 'em?

823
01:11:10,295 --> 01:11:12,089
Straight ahead!

824
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:37,364
- Kitty!
- Boo!

825
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:47,124
Look at everybody's
favourite scarer now!

826
01:11:47,207 --> 01:11:50,627
You stupid, pathetic waste!

827
01:11:53,463 --> 01:11:58,468
You've been number one for too long,
Sullivan. Now your time is up!

828
01:11:58,552 --> 01:12:03,098
And don't worry,
I'll take good care of the kid.

829
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:05,767
No!

830
01:12:26,204 --> 01:12:29,416
She's not scared of you any more.

831
01:12:29,499 --> 01:12:32,961
Looks like you're out of a job.

832
01:12:33,045 --> 01:12:37,007
All right. Come on. Over the plate.
Let's see the old stuff here, pal. Come
on, now. Chuck 'im. Chuck 'im, baby.

833
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,509
- Hey, please, don't! Don't!
- Hum, baby, hum, baby. Here's the pitch.

834
01:12:39,593 --> 01:12:42,888
And he is out of here!

835
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:45,223
Mama, another gator
got in the house.

836
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:48,852
Another gator?
Give me that shovel! Come here!

837
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:51,730
Get it, Ma!
Get that gator!

838
01:12:52,856 --> 01:12:55,943
- Care to do the honours, Mikey?
- With pleasure.

839
01:13:05,827 --> 01:13:09,831
That's right, Boo.
You did it! You beat him.

840
01:13:09,915 --> 01:13:11,333
Come on.

841
01:13:14,044 --> 01:13:19,800
Okay, Boo, it's time to go home.
Take care of yourself
and be a good girl, okay?

842
01:13:19,883 --> 01:13:22,803
- Oh, no!
- The power's out. Make her laugh again.

843
01:13:22,886 --> 01:13:25,973
All right. I got a move here.
It'll bring down the house.

844
01:13:29,768 --> 01:13:35,274
- Oh, sorry. She didn't see that.
- What? What'd you do, forget to check
if her stupid hood was up? You big dope!

845
01:13:35,357 --> 01:13:38,485
Uncle Mike,
try not to yell in front of her.

846
01:13:38,568 --> 01:13:41,238
- You know we still need her to laugh.
- Right.

847
01:13:41,321 --> 01:13:44,074
Hey, Boo! Just kidding. Look!

848
01:13:44,157 --> 01:13:48,662
Funny, right, huh? See, with the...
These are the jokes, kid.

849
01:13:48,745 --> 01:13:52,124
- What's happening?
- Hold on!

850
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:55,252
When the door lands in the station,
cut the power.

851
01:13:55,335 --> 01:14:00,966
You'll have the child and the criminals
responsible for this whole mess.

852
01:14:01,049 --> 01:14:04,803
Great. A welcoming committee.
What are we gonna do?

853
01:14:16,815 --> 01:14:21,445
This is the CD A. Come out slowly
with the child in plain sight.

854
01:14:21,528 --> 01:14:25,907
Okay. Okay. You got us.
Here we are. Here's the kid.

855
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:30,203
I'm cooperating. But before you
take us away, I have one thing to say.

856
01:14:31,914 --> 01:14:33,874
- Catch!
- 23-19!
- 23-19!

857
01:14:33,957 --> 01:14:37,294
- We have a toxic projectile.
Isolate the contaminate.
- Halt!

858
01:14:37,377 --> 01:14:40,631
- After the suspect!
- Clear the area!
- Stop him!

859
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:47,137
- Come on.
- Don't let them get away.

860
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:51,683
What? Wait, wait! Come back!
He has the child!

861
01:14:56,271 --> 01:14:59,900
Sullivan? Sullivan!
Give me the child!

862
01:15:01,234 --> 01:15:03,278
Give her to me!

863
01:15:10,911 --> 01:15:15,332
Open this door! Open this door!

864
01:15:20,003 --> 01:15:24,049
Sullivan! Don't do it.

865
01:15:24,132 --> 01:15:27,970
- Come on.
- Don't go in that room!

866
01:15:30,681 --> 01:15:33,600
I think we stopped him, Boo.
You're safe now.

867
01:15:33,684 --> 01:15:36,728
You be a good girl, okay?

868
01:15:36,812 --> 01:15:39,106
This has gone far enough, James.

869
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:41,817
- She's home now.
Just leave her alone.
- I can't do that!

870
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,611
She's seen too much.
You both have.

871
01:15:44,695 --> 01:15:47,572
- It doesn't have to be this way.
- I have no choice!

872
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:51,994
- Times have changed.
Scaring isn't enough any more.
- But kidnapping children?

873
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:55,163
I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die!

874
01:15:55,247 --> 01:15:59,835
And I'll silence anyone
who gets in my way!

875
01:15:59,918 --> 01:16:02,629
<i>- No!
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetheart.</i>

876
01:16:02,713 --> 01:16:05,382
<i>- What? What? Wh-Wh-What is this?
- Good night, Mom. Good night, Mom.</i>

877
01:16:05,465 --> 01:16:08,927
<i>Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.</i>

878
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:12,139
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys...

879
01:16:12,222 --> 01:16:14,099
but I spotted several
big mistakes.

880
01:16:14,182 --> 01:16:16,810
- But... But...
But h-how did... h-how did...
- You know what?

881
01:16:16,893 --> 01:16:19,688
Let's watch my favourite part
again, shall we?

882
01:16:19,771 --> 01:16:22,899
<i>I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die!</i>

883
01:16:22,983 --> 01:16:26,903
<i>- What? What?
- I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die!</i>

884
01:16:26,987 --> 01:16:30,324
<i>I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die!</i>

885
01:16:30,407 --> 01:16:32,743
- I'll get him.
All right, come with us.
- Wh-What are you doing?

886
01:16:32,826 --> 01:16:36,914
Take your hands off me. You can't arrest
me. I hope you're happy, Sullivan.

887
01:16:36,997 --> 01:16:40,500
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!

888
01:16:40,584 --> 01:16:43,211
Where will everyone
get their scream now?

889
01:16:43,295 --> 01:16:48,550
The energy crisis will only
get worse because of you!

890
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:55,098
Stay where you are.
Number One wants to talk to you.

891
01:16:55,182 --> 01:16:56,975
Attention!

892
01:17:03,565 --> 01:17:06,401
- Hello, boys.
- Roz?

893
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:12,324
Two and a half years of undercover work
were almost wasted...

894
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:15,994
when you intercepted
that child, Mr Sullivan.

895
01:17:16,078 --> 01:17:19,539
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known...

896
01:17:19,623 --> 01:17:22,459
that this went
all the way up to Waternoose.

897
01:17:26,505 --> 01:17:29,549
Now, about the girl.

898
01:17:29,633 --> 01:17:32,761
I just want to send her home.

899
01:17:32,844 --> 01:17:36,348
Very good.
Bring me a door shredder.

900
01:17:36,431 --> 01:17:39,476
What? You mean...
You mean I can't see her again?

901
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:42,896
That's the way it has to be.

902
01:17:44,231 --> 01:17:47,067
I'll give you five minutes.

903
01:17:57,703 --> 01:18:00,831
- Well, so long, kid.
- Mike Wazowski!

904
01:18:00,914 --> 01:18:05,210
Yeah. Aw, Boo.
It's been fun.

905
01:18:08,005 --> 01:18:10,632
Go ahead. Go grow up.

906
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:34,406
Uh, B-Boo... Um, Boo?

907
01:18:34,489 --> 01:18:37,910
Oh, look at that.
Yeah, you know...

908
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:40,495
Oh, that's cute, yeah.

909
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:43,749
Uh, Boo, um...

910
01:18:43,832 --> 01:18:46,877
- Well, that's very nice.
- Kitty.

911
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,129
Come here, you.

912
01:18:56,595 --> 01:18:59,514
<i>Oh, he's a happy bear</i>

913
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:09,149
Nothing's coming out of your closet
to scare you any more, right?

914
01:19:09,232 --> 01:19:12,319
Yeah.

915
01:19:12,402 --> 01:19:14,905
Goodbye, Boo.

916
01:19:14,988 --> 01:19:17,366
Kitty.

917
01:19:17,449 --> 01:19:19,868
Kitty has to go.

918
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:01,410
Boo!

919
01:20:04,162 --> 01:20:06,873
Kitty?

920
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:18,760
None of this ever happened,
gentlemen.

921
01:20:18,844 --> 01:20:22,931
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

922
01:20:44,369 --> 01:20:47,122
Take him away.

923
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:51,585
I bet we get the rest of the day off.

924
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:54,546
You idiot! They're gonna
shut down the factory!

925
01:20:56,798 --> 01:21:00,761
I'm tellin' you, pal, when that wall
went up, you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.

926
01:21:00,844 --> 01:21:04,681
I hope we get a copy of that tape.
Hey, you all right?

927
01:21:04,765 --> 01:21:08,101
Come on, pal. Cheer up.
We did it. We got Boo home.

928
01:21:08,185 --> 01:21:13,106
Oh, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet and, gee, hundreds
of people will be out of work now.

929
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:15,984
Not to mention the angry mob
that'll come after us
when there's no more power.

930
01:21:16,068 --> 01:21:19,780
But hey, at least we had
some laughs, right?

931
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:24,910
Laughs.

932
01:21:44,471 --> 01:21:47,474
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello! Hello! Testing! Testing!

933
01:21:47,557 --> 01:21:50,435
Hey, good evening. How are you?
How are you? Nice to see you.

934
01:21:50,519 --> 01:21:53,730
I tell ya, it's great to be here
in your room. Where you from?

935
01:21:55,607 --> 01:21:58,443
Never mind. You're in kindergarten,
right? Oh, I love kindergarten.

936
01:21:58,527 --> 01:22:03,156
Best three years of my life.
Of my life.

937
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,826
But I love sports.
Dodge ball was the best. Oh, yeah.

938
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:10,831
I was the fastest one out there.
Of course, I was the ball. But I...

939
01:22:10,914 --> 01:22:12,916
I was the ball, see?

940
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,793
All right.

941
01:22:28,932 --> 01:22:33,061
Hey, thanks a lot.
I'll be here all week.
Remember to tip your waitresses.

942
01:22:37,649 --> 01:22:40,861
Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota
on the first kid of the day.

943
01:22:40,944 --> 01:22:43,989
Not bad, huh? You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing...

944
01:22:44,072 --> 01:22:46,408
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

945
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:51,830
Uh-huh. And the fact that laughter
is ten times more powerful than scream
had nothing to do with it.

946
01:22:51,914 --> 01:22:55,626
Oh, Googley Bear.
Come here, you.

947
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:58,420
- Schmoopsie-poo!
- Googley.

948
01:23:00,672 --> 01:23:04,468
Girls. Girls. Quit.
Stop, stop, stop.

949
01:23:04,551 --> 01:23:06,887
Michael, you're such a charmer.

950
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:09,389
- Hey, did you bring the magazine?
- They just delivered a whole box.

951
01:23:09,473 --> 01:23:13,393
Let me see it!
Sulley and I made the cover, right?

952
01:23:14,811 --> 01:23:18,857
- I don't believe it.
- Googley Bear.

953
01:23:18,941 --> 01:23:23,320
I'm on the cover of a magazine!

954
01:23:28,033 --> 01:23:30,535
Oh, this is great!

955
01:23:58,021 --> 01:24:00,482
- Hey, Sulley!
- Hey, uh, Mike. I was, uh, just...

956
01:24:00,565 --> 01:24:03,235
- Listen, if you got a minute, there's
something I wanna show you. Okay?
- B-B-But...

957
01:24:03,318 --> 01:24:07,990
- Close your eyes. Follow me.
- I-I-I...
- Come on. No peeking.

958
01:24:08,156 --> 01:24:11,201
- Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming.
Come on. Keep coming, keep coming.
- Mike!

959
01:24:11,285 --> 01:24:14,204
And follow the sultry sound
of my voice.

960
01:24:14,288 --> 01:24:17,874
Okay, stop. Open 'em.

961
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:21,420
- Ta-da!
- Mike!

962
01:24:22,546 --> 01:24:25,257
- Is that...
- Sorry it took so long, pal.

963
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,718
It was a lot of wood
to go through.

964
01:24:27,801 --> 01:24:31,305
You know, it only works
if you have every piece.

965
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:00,918
Boo?

966
01:25:01,001 --> 01:25:02,794
Kitty!

967
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:15,724
Speed. Marker.
And action.

968
01:25:15,807 --> 01:25:19,102
<i>If I were a rich man</i>

969
01:25:19,186 --> 01:25:21,396
<i>With a million or two</i>

970
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:26,026
<i>I'd live in a penthouse</i>

971
01:25:26,109 --> 01:25:28,946
<i>In a room with a view</i>

972
01:25:31,114 --> 01:25:35,035
<i>- And if I were handsome
- No way!
- It could happen.</i>

973
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:37,329
<i>'Cause dreams do come true.</i>

974
01:25:37,412 --> 01:25:39,122
Roll slate.

975
01:25:39,206 --> 01:25:43,126
<i>I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have you</i>

976
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:47,005
<i>Wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have</i>

977
01:25:47,089 --> 01:25:50,968
<i>Wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have</i>

978
01:25:51,051 --> 01:25:53,929
<i>Wouldn't have nothin'</i>

979
01:25:55,222 --> 01:25:57,224
Okay, cut.

980
01:25:59,101 --> 01:26:01,937
Okay, you're finished now, right?

981
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,022
- Hello.
- Hello.

982
01:26:07,317 --> 01:26:10,028
Come on, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.

983
01:26:10,112 --> 01:26:12,197
- Oh, sorry.
- See you later, fellas.

984
01:26:12,281 --> 01:26:16,159
- Go get 'em, Mr Solomon.
- You idiot! It's Sullivan, not Solomon.

985
01:26:16,243 --> 01:26:18,245
- What?
- You're messing up the scene.

986
01:26:18,328 --> 01:26:20,372
- Sorry.
- We're never gonna work
in Hollywood again.

987
01:26:20,455 --> 01:26:22,040
- Let me do it over.
- Shut up!

988
01:26:22,124 --> 01:26:24,543
- Keep rolling!
- You're making it worse!

989
01:26:24,626 --> 01:26:27,504
Duck and cover, people!

990
01:26:31,925 --> 01:26:34,219
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.

991
01:26:40,309 --> 01:26:42,311
Ta-da!

992
01:26:45,314 --> 01:26:47,691
Aw, Boo, it's been fun.

993
01:26:50,652 --> 01:26:53,238
Go ahead. Go throw up.

994
01:26:54,615 --> 01:26:58,076
- What? Wh-Wh...
What did I say? What? What?
- Cut.

995
01:26:59,661 --> 01:27:01,663
Hey, Ted, good morning!

996
01:27:03,457 --> 01:27:06,251
- Cut.
- Hey, how was that? Was I scary?

997
01:27:06,335 --> 01:27:08,545
- Do I get the part?
- Thank you.
- Can I do it again?

998
01:27:08,629 --> 01:27:10,631
- I can be taller.
- Next.

999
01:27:10,714 --> 01:27:12,925
And action.

1000
01:27:13,008 --> 01:27:15,969
Okay, let's move, let's move,
let's move. Come on!

1001
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,683
Can we get a little more wax
on the floor, please?

1002
01:27:21,767 --> 01:27:24,311
Wait a minute.
Randall? That cheater.

1003
01:27:24,394 --> 01:27:26,897
- He's trying to boost his numbers.
- There's something else.

1004
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:30,233
- What?
- Look-lay in the bag-bay.

1005
01:27:30,317 --> 01:27:33,612
- I think you mean
ook-lay in the ag-bay.
- What? Didn't I, uh...

1006
01:27:33,695 --> 01:27:38,951
Well, you know,
maybe you should just take a minute
and ead-ray your ipt-scray.

1007
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:41,578
You think he's gonna come
through the closet and scare you.

1008
01:27:41,662 --> 01:27:45,999
Oh, boy. How do I explain this?
Uh, it's empty. See?

1009
01:27:46,083 --> 01:27:48,085
Guess who!

1010
01:27:57,552 --> 01:27:59,554
Hey, what's the...

1011
01:28:00,973 --> 01:28:04,059
Okay, very funny.
Hey, I look good in a suit.

1012
01:28:04,142 --> 01:28:06,144
Marker.

1013
01:28:06,228 --> 01:28:08,689
Let her rip! Go!

1014
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:15,320
Shut it off! Shut it off!
Shut it off!

1015
01:28:18,991 --> 01:28:21,243
You're making it worse!

1016
01:28:22,578 --> 01:28:25,998
<i>But I must admit it</i>

1017
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:28,709
<i>Big guy, you always come through</i>

1018
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:35,757
<i>I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have you</i>

1019
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:41,680
<i>You and me together</i>

1020
01:28:41,763 --> 01:28:45,392
<i>That's how it always should be</i>

1021
01:28:45,475 --> 01:28:48,645
<i>One without the other</i>

1022
01:28:48,729 --> 01:28:51,648
<i>Don't mean nothin'to me</i>

1023
01:28:51,732 --> 01:28:54,693
<i>Nothin'to me</i>

1024
01:28:54,776 --> 01:28:57,321
Oh, hey!
We're rehearsing a, a scene...

1025
01:28:57,404 --> 01:28:59,823
for the upcoming company play
called...

1026
01:28:59,907 --> 01:29:03,368
<i>Put That Thing Back Where It Came From,
Or So Help Me.</i>

1027
01:29:03,452 --> 01:29:06,079
<i>It's a musical. Yeah.
Put that thing back where it came from</i>

1028
01:29:06,163 --> 01:29:07,831
<i>Or so help me</i>

1029
01:29:07,915 --> 01:29:10,250
<i>Get that thing away from me
you guys</i>

1030
01:29:10,334 --> 01:29:15,672
<i>Put that thing back where it came from
or I'll poke myself in the eye</i>

1031
01:29:15,756 --> 01:29:18,550
It's, uh, i-it's a work in progress.
I-It's gonna get better.

1032
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,807
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this year's company play...

1033
01:29:25,891 --> 01:29:29,102
starring, written
and directed by Mike...

1034
01:29:29,186 --> 01:29:32,940
- And produced.
- And produced by Mike Wazowski.

1035
01:29:37,653 --> 01:29:40,489
<i>Put that thing back where it came from
or so help me</i>

1036
01:29:40,572 --> 01:29:43,784
<i>So help me
So help me get by</i>

1037
01:29:43,867 --> 01:29:46,536
<i>Put that thing back where it came from
or so help me</i>

1038
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,790
<i>So help me
I just gotta cry</i>

1039
01:29:49,873 --> 01:29:52,793
Your seat is right over there, sir.

1040
01:29:52,876 --> 01:29:56,463
<i>- Boo!
- There's a child, there's a child
There's a human child</i>

1041
01:29:56,546 --> 01:29:59,591
<i>- Oh, no!
- Running around the restaurant
This is really wrong</i>

1042
01:29:59,675 --> 01:30:02,261
<i>What in heaven's name
will become of us</i>

1043
01:30:02,344 --> 01:30:05,305
<i>We who are living
in Monstropolis</i>

1044
01:30:08,433 --> 01:30:12,813
All right, Wazowski,
tell us where the kid is.

1045
01:30:12,896 --> 01:30:14,606
Boo!

1046
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:17,401
I will never talk. Never!

1047
01:30:19,987 --> 01:30:25,117
<i>She's out of our hair</i>

1048
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:30,289
<i>And just when I dare to care</i>

1049
01:30:30,372 --> 01:30:33,667
<i>She says, au contraire</i>

1050
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:39,089
<i>You're my pair of friends
I love you</i>

1051
01:30:40,549 --> 01:30:42,217
Keep it together, man.

1052
01:30:42,301 --> 01:30:46,096
<i>And so we put that kid back</i>

1053
01:30:46,179 --> 01:30:48,599
<i>Where she came from</i>

1054
01:30:48,682 --> 01:30:51,476
<i>And she helped us to find</i>

1055
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,187
<i>A better tomorrow</i>

1056
01:30:54,271 --> 01:30:58,483
<i>Today</i>

1057
01:30:58,567 --> 01:31:04,531
Thank you! What a night
for my mother to be in the audience,
ladies and gentlemen. My mom!

1058
01:31:06,491 --> 01:31:08,493
Thank you, Monstropolis!

1059
01:31:10,329 --> 01:31:13,790
<i>- I don't have to say it
- Aw, say it anyway.</i>

1060
01:31:13,874 --> 01:31:16,460
<i>'Cause we both know it's true</i>

1061
01:31:18,211 --> 01:31:22,090
<i>I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have</i>

1062
01:31:22,174 --> 01:31:26,094
<i>I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have</i>

1063
01:31:26,178 --> 01:31:30,307
<i>I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have you</i>

1064
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:34,811
<i>Wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have</i>

1065
01:31:34,895 --> 01:31:37,940
<i>You</i>

1066
01:31:38,023 --> 01:31:40,150
One more time!

1067
01:31:40,233 --> 01:31:42,486
It worked!

1068
01:31:42,569 --> 01:31:45,697
<i>- Don't have to say it
- I'm gonna anyway!</i>

1069
01:31:45,781 --> 01:31:50,160
<i>- 'Cause we both know it's true
- Let's take it home, big guy!</i>

1070
01:31:50,244 --> 01:31:54,122
<i>I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have</i>

1071
01:31:54,206 --> 01:31:58,001
<i>I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have</i>

1072
01:31:58,085 --> 01:32:02,089
<i>I wouldn't have nothin'
if I didn't have</i>

1073
01:32:02,172 --> 01:32:05,133
<i>- You
- You! You!</i>

1074
01:32:05,217 --> 01:32:09,680
<i>- A-E-l-O
- That means you. Yeah!</i>
