1
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,153
That makes all my actions
when I move through the world,

2
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,596
I do things better 'cause I can
see it all laid out like a map.

3
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,874
Have you ever looked
at a map?

4
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,296
Yes, if I'm not mistaken.
Do you know how to read a map?

5
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,576
Do you know how to read a map?
Yeah.

6
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,717
Your father's a perfectly good guy,
but it is a lot of stuff

7
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,519
that he just doesn't understand
about the world that I understand.

8
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,198
Listen, huh?
My dad...

9
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,635
I haven't asked you
a question, yet.

10
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,917
Listen. Shh, don't tell you mother.
Shut up, be quiet.

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,136
Shush, be quiet.
I haven't asked you the question, yet.

12
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,991
I haven't asked you anything.
Listen.

13
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,832
We got it.
Don't worry about it.

14
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,989
Listen.

15
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,718
If there was... If you could take
one guy to an island with you

16
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,950
and you knew you'd be safe
'cause he was the best man,

17
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,680
he was going to figure out
how to survive,

18
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,976
he was going
to make everything,

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,056
he was going to make the world
a good place on the island,

20
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,594
he was going
to keep you happy, he, he...

21
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,159
This is the best man
for the job.

22
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,595
No matter what, if it was
between me and your father,

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,113
who would you take?
My daddy.

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,760
I don't see...
Hang on a second.

25
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,751
Listen, I didn't think
you're wrong about that.

26
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,638
It's your choice to make, but I
want you to understand something.

27
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,278
There's a lot of...

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,430
Hey. What happened?
What is that?

29
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,551
You can't leave
your fish around like that.

30
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,474
I don't know why the hell
it keeps dripping.

31
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,676
All night long,
drip, drip, drip.

32
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,910
I've had the fucking thing
repaired ten times.

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,752
You need
a new stopper.

34
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,757
Is that it?

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,391
Well, your stopper, it's rotted around
the edges, so it's not making a seal,

36
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,074
The water is going to drip
through into the bowl.

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,676
I could bring you
a new one tomorrow,

38
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,435
or you might want to consider
replacing the whole apparatus.

39
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,476
What do you recommend?

40
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,039
I could replace
the stopper first.

41
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,759
If that doesn't work, I could
replace the whole apparatus.

42
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,593
You can't give me
a professional recommendation?

43
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,480
I don't know.
It's really up to you.

44
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,558
Tomorrow my sister-in-law's
coming over with the nephews.

45
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,111
I got to take the car in.
Um...

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,552
No, it's my sister Janine's
oldest daughter's Bat Mitzvah.

47
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,958
I'm looking forward
to being bored to death.

48
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,878
The girl doesn't want it,
her father doesn't want it.

49
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,554
And don't even ask me.

50
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,835
Seven hours in the car.

51
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,714
I could really
slit my throat.

52
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,752
But, oh, well,
the little girls are charming.

53
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,790
Lee, I am so sorry.

54
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,029
That's okay.

55
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,674
This is so gross.
That's all right.

56
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,116
No, tell him to come.

57
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,359
Okay, yeah.

58
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,994
But-But Cindy,
I have to tell you something.

59
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,117
I'm like in love
with my janitor.

60
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,031
Is that sick?

61
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,994
Have you ever had a sexual
fantasy about your handyman?

62
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,789
Well, it's awkward because he's
literally like cleaning the shit out

63
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,916
of my toilet bowl
right now.

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,878
And I don't think
I'm at my most alluring.

65
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,669
Yeah, maybe you're right.
It's not like I met him socially.

66
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,479
Okay, thank you, Cindy.

67
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,551
Okay, like 20 minutes.

68
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,232
Bye.

69
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,153
All right, all set.

70
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,840
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

71
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,638
Can I give you a tip?

72
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,870
You mean
like a suggestion?

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,993
No, I mean, like, a tip.
Oh, okay.

74
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,877
Thank you.

75
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,158
Yeah, good night.
Good night. Good bye.

76
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,114
I mean, how many times do we
have to fix these fucking pipes?

77
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,873
Every time I take a shower,
their entire apartment has a flood.

78
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,190
It's driving me insane.

79
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,080
Well, I'll get you a plumber
in here tomorrow,

80
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,536
but I'd say that we're going to have to
break through the tile and isolate the leak

81
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,936
because there's quite a lot
of water down there.

82
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,349
How do you know it's me?
Why is it automatically me?

83
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,635
Well, because it if was coming
from higher up,

84
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,872
you'd have water damage in your ceiling
or in your wall, and it's all dry.

85
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,439
Great.

86
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,312
Well, it might just be
the caulking.

87
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,913
This whole tub
needs to be re-caulked.

88
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,296
Have you taken a bath or shower
in the last couple of hours?

89
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,753
Yes.

90
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,558
Well, it might just be that.
Okay.

91
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,517
And how are you planning
to find that out?

92
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,160
Well, we could run the shower
and see if it drip downstairs.

93
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,071
Oh, you want me
to take a shower now?

94
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,559
No.

95
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,616
You want me to take a shower
right now while you stand there

96
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,473
watching to see if it drips
into the Friedrich's apartment?

97
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,910
I don't give a fuck
what you do, Mrs. Olsen.

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,116
I'm just trying to fix
the fucking leak.

99
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,070
I... I didn't like that.

100
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,389
How dare you talk
to me like that?

101
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,516
Get the fuck out
of my fucking house.

102
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,313
Okay. Get the fuck out
out of my fucking house

103
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,470
before I call the police.

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,672
All right. Did you hear me?
I said get out.

105
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,955
I can't.
You're blocking the doorway.

106
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,831
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

107
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,036
You can't talk
to the tenants like that.

108
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,112
Look, Lee, you do good work.
You're dependable

109
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,475
But I get these complaints
all the time.

110
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,030
You're rude, you're unfriendly,
you won't say good morning.

111
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,269
I mean, come on.

112
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,715
Mr. Emery,
I fix the plumbing.

113
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,791
I take out the garbage.
I paint their apartments.

114
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,190
I do electrical work, which we
both know is against the law.

115
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,477
I show up on time,
I'm working four buildings,

116
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,835
and you're getting
all the money.

117
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,309
So do whatever
you're going to do.

118
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,472
Would you be willing
to apologize to Mrs. Olsen?

119
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,437
For what?

120
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,312
All right, all right,
I'll talk to her.

121
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,056
Here you go.
Thanks.

122
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,798
How you doing?
Good.

123
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,599
How's things going, all right?
Yeah.

124
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,234
You see the game?
Yeah, I did.

125
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,152
You think they have a shot?
No.

126
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,470
Not one.

127
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,154
Dropped the first two, they're
going to lose the next three.

128
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,590
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

129
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,999
That's okay.
Did I get you?

130
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,991
Yes.
I got you.

131
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,031
It's okay.
Let me get you some napkins.

132
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,919
I'm okay. Hey, Lenny,
can I grab some napkins?

133
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,517
Thanks.

134
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,511
Thank you.
Here.

135
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,158
Thanks.

136
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,078
Well, now I spilled my beer
all over you, my name's Sharon.

137
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,789
Uh, that's okay.

138
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,552
And you are...

139
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,992

do you know me?

159
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,310
Uh... I don't think so.

160
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,833
No, I don't think so, either.

161
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,399

162
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,436
No, not yet.
No.

No.

164
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,590
So, what the fuck
you looking at me for?

165
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,154
Excuse me? I said what the fuck
are you looking at me for?

166
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,317
Hey, take a fucking walk... No, no,
no, don't apologize to this asshole.

167
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,675
We really weren't looking
at you, seriously.

168
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,830
Let me go.
I got to go take a hike.

169
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,593

a fucking hike.

175
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,000
Where do you think
he went left?

176
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,957
Other left he went.

177
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,473
Ten points,
San Antonio lead.

178
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,676
Isaiah Thomas
been so good this season.

179
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,796
Knocks down
that three pointer.

180
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,556
Hello, this is Lee.

181
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,550
Oh. Okay.

182
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,517
When did that happen?

183
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,358
Well, how's he doing now?

184
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,599
No, don't do that.

185
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,636
I'm going to come
up there right now.

186
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,030
I'll be up there
in a hour and a half.

187
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,309
Okay?

188
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,630
Thank you.
Bye.

189
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,915
Mr. Emery,
it's Lee again.

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,312
I contacted Jose, who says he can cover
for me till Friday night at least.

191
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,871
Uh, after that, Gene MacAdavey
will take over until I get back.

192
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,675
I wouldn't do anything with
Mr. and Mrs. Fredrick's ceiling

193
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,830
until you get
a real plumber in there.

194
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,195
But what
are you going to do?

195
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,477
I will let you know a soon
as I have more information.

196
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,835
I should be in Manchester
a week at least.

197
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,751
Thank you very much.
Bye.

198
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,679
Come on.

199
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,471
Go.

200
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,069
Hiya, Lee.

201
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,513
Is he dead?

202
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,151
I'm sorry, Lee. He passed
away about an hour ago.

203
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,759
Oh.

204
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,875
I'm so sorry.

205
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,518
Did you see him?

206
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,112
No, I mean, uh...
George brought him in.

207
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,591
We were looking at the boat this
morning, and the he just...

208
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,148
I don't know,
he just, like, fell over.

209
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,674
I thought he was
kidding me at first.

210
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,917
Then I called the ambulance,
and, uh...

211
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,798
That was it.

212
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,593
I'll just call Dr. Muller
and tell him that you're here.

213
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,269
Where's Dr. Betheny?
Oh, she's on maternity leave. Here he is.

214
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,358
Lee? I'm Dr. Muller.
We spoke on the phone.

215
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,953
Yeah. Hi.

216
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,110
I'm very, very sorry.

217
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,475
Thank you.

218
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,158
Hello, George.
Hiya, Jim.

219
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,396
How you holding up?
Oh...

220
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,674
Great, you know.

221
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,712
It's a very sad day.
Yeah.

222
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,438
Where's my brother?

223
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,159
He's downstairs.
You can see him if you want.

224
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,399
What happened to him?

225
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,675
Went into cardiac arrest.

226
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,548
You know his heart was very weak at
this point, and it just gave out.

227
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,518
I'm sorry you didn't get here in time,
but as I told you on the phone...

228
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,556
Aw, fuck this.

229
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Sorry.

230
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,355
That's okay, buddy.
That's perfectly all right.

231
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,510
Did anybody call my uncle?

232
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,631
His Uncle Donny.
Ah.

233
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,149
Yeah, my Aunt and Uncle...
No, Lee. Lee, no.

234
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,233
Donny got a job in Minnesota, like,
a while ago.

235
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,311
Minnesota?

236
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,279
He got a job in some outfit
in Minnetonka, Minnesota.

237
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,918
If you can believe that.

238
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
Joe didn't tell you
about that?

239
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,555
No.

240
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,473
I can call them
if you want, Lee.

241
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,039
Tell them
what happened.

242
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,636
Okay, thanks.
Oh, no problem.

243
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,551
And tell him
what happened.

244
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,200
Tell them
I'll call them tonight.

245
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,232
Talk about arrangements.

246
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,151
Somebody should call
my wife.

247
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,669
Your, uh...

248
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,595
Ex-wife.
You mean Randi?

249
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,910
Randi. Yes, I'm sorry.
I meant Randi.

250
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,911
I already thought of that.
I'll take care of it.

251
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,991
Okay, thank you.
No problem.

252
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,992
Can I see him now?
Sure.

253
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,073
Lee, I can wait up here, Lee,
if you need anything.

254
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,991
Okay.

255
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,559
Thanks.

256
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,516
Would you like a Kleenex?
Yeah. Thanks, yeah.

257
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,194
Can I get a couple Kleenex please?
Thanks, hun.

258
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,636
I'm sorry.
Oh, please.

259
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,838
How is Dr. Betheny?

260
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,434
Oh, she's doing very well.
She just had twin girls.

261
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,636
Ah, lrene told me that.
Yeah.

262
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,712
I'll call her this afternoon
and tell her what happened.

263
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,109
She was very good to him.

264
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,031
Yes, she was.

265
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,917
The disease is commonly referred
to as congestive heart failure.

266
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,035
Oh, my God.

267
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,388
Are you familiar with it?
No.

268
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,232
Then what are you saying
"Oh, my God" for?

269
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,355
Because what is it?

270
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,954
What she's trying
to explain, honey...

271
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,274
I'm sorry, Dr. Beth...

272
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,520
Betheny. Betheny, I'm sorry.
I can never get it right.

273
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,629
Not a problem.

274
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,314
So... you were saying.

275
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,473
It's a gradual deterioration
of the muscles of the heart.

276
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,596
It's usually associated
with older people,

277
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,712
but in rare cases it will occur
in a younger person.

278
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,836
Some people live up
to 50 or 60 years

279
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,478
with just
an occasional attack,

280
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,194
but most people
suffer periodic episodes,

281
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,918
like the one
you had on Monday.

282
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,080
Which mimic the symptoms of a heart attack
in which further weaken the muscle.

283
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,157
They can put you out of
commission for a week, two weeks,

284
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,736
and you'll need to be hospitalized
so that we can monitor your heart

285
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,832
because the risk of cardiac arrest
is elevated for a week or two.

286
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,035
Oh, my God.

287
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,310
But in between most people
feel perfectly healthy.

288
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,436
You can basically live
a normal life.

289
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,036
Wait, so what do you mean
some people live to be 50, 60 years?

290
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,553
I mean, you saying total?

291
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,200
Or you saying when they're
diagnosed with this, or what?

292
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,953
What are you saying?
Tell me the fucking truth.

293
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,314
Total.

294
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,710
For most people with the
particulars of your condition,

295
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,992
the average life expectancy
is five to ten years.

296
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,196
The statistics vary widely.

297
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,392
You're not a statistic,
you're just one person.

298
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,438
And we don't know what's
going to happen to you, yet.

299
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,789
But it's not
a good disease.

300
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,751
What is a good disease?

301
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,996
Poison lvy.
Athlete's foot.

302
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,195
It's a comedy routine.

303
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,719
Elise, please.
For Christ's sake.

304
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,876
Oh, my God, when am I going
to put one foot right?

305
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,315
How about a hint?
Elise.

306
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,158
Daddy.
What?

307
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,391
No, she's fine.

308
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,674
We're all upset.

309
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,080
We're all going to listen.

310
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,216
We're going to ask any of the
question we want to ask,

311
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,879
and then we're going to figure
out what to do together, right?

312
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,029
Sure.

313
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,759
So, you were saying Dr. Beth.

314
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,751
It's Dr. Bethany, Dad.
Try to get it right.

315
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,308
I do not see where the humor
lies in this situation.

316
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,039
Elise, you must calm down.
No.

317
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,118
No, no more,
I'm not going... no.

318
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,589
Elise, let me get you
a glass of water.

319
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,591
Daddy, forget it.

320
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,238
Forget it.
Forget it. Like you...

321
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,390
Everybody should be
just like you.

322
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,597
You know what? I'm tired
of being the bad guy here.

323
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,238
Who's in the fucking
hospital here?

324
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,595
Right, so I'll be
the bad guy,

325
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,280
and you be in the hospital
and explain the jokes to your son.

326
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,590
I'm going home.
You're going home?

327
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,875
- You're going home?
- Yes.

328
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,678
Let me get her back.
Fuck her.

329
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,633
You want to stop with that shit?
Come on with that stuff.

330
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,793
Thank you, Tony.

331
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,789
I have to get up to Manchester.
Nobody told Patrick right?

332
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,856
No, you had asked for us
to wait for you to get here.

333
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,632
Yes, thank you.

334
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,354
So, um...

335
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,759
What is the procedure now?

336
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,336
Well, now you have to make
arrangements with the funeral parlor,

337
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,476
and they pretty much
take care of everything.

338
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,680
I don't know
the name of one.

339
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,274
That's all right. We can help
you with that. Oh, yeah.

340
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,236
Then they'll just come
and pick him up? Yeah.

341
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,958
I can make
those calls, Lee.

342
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,719
Let me know if you need any help
with anything. Okay, thank you.

343
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,352
We've got to talk
about the boat

344
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,439
and the website
and all of that.

345
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,078
Sure.
I'm around.

346
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,639
I got to get up there
before school lets out so...

347
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,314
You just have to sign
for Joe's belongings.

348
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,799
Right this way.

349
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,753
Just got to sign
right here.

350
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,832
Where's Joe's belongings?

351
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,195
The plastic bag right here.

352
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,034
Give me a sec.

353
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,272
Where's Joe's belongings?

354
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,856
All right, all right,
that's good, hold.

355
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,838
Like that?
Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line.

356
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,896
If you get a strike,
it's going to slice it right open.

357
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,672
You know what happens then.
What?

358
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,797
Sharks will smell the blood
and they'll rip this boat apart.

359
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,950
No, they won't.
Yeah, they will.

360
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,599
Dad, will they?
Yes, sir.

361
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Shut up.

362
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,274
You know, I've seen a school of
sharks tear a boat to pieces

363
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,759
like it was made
of cardboard,

364
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,831
because some kid threw a
band-aid in the water.

365
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,428
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he did.

366
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,519
Oh, yeah.

367
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,794
No, you didn't.

368
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,518
Sometimes the only way
to keep them off

369
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,353
is to throw the kid directly
in the ocean to distract them.

370
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,034
Shut up. Sharks don't
even swim in schools.

371
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,032
Huh? He says sharks
don't swim in schools.

372
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,269
Smart kid.

373
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,759
Yeah, he is.

374
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,559
A really smart kid is exactly
the kind of quality meal

375
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,552
a humongous school of sharks is looking
for when they're circling a boat.

376
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,870
Uncle Lee,
shut up.

377
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,576
Hey, you got a strike.
Strike, strike, strike.

378
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,319
Ease up on the drag, ease up on your drag.
Watch your fucking thumb.

379
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,829
Hey, you got a strike now.
Don't hit me, catch your fish.

380
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,837
No swearing.
You got a strike.

381
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,275
I got him, we got him.
Drive the boat, mind your business.

382
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,918
You got to get
the hook in him.

383
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,638
Shut up.
Mind your business.

384
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,228
What kind of fish is it?
It's got to be a Great White.

385
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,754
It's got to be a Great White Patty.
Maybe a barracuda.

386
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,910
It's not a shark.

387
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,036
Come on, pull it up.
It's not a shark.

388
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,519
Stop talking...

389
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,470
How come that's
connected to those?

390
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,056
It's not, kid.
It just looks that way.

391
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,296
I'm trying
to teach you the islands.

392
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,676
That's the island the rich guy bought
so no one else will put a house on it.

393
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,672
That's how rich he is.
Baker lsland, Misery lsland.

394
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,399
Misery lsland is where me and
your aunt Randi got married.

395
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,518
Hello?
Yeah. Hi, honey.

396
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,555
Suzy, Daddy's home.

397
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,637
Hi, Suzy.
Daddy's home.

398
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,194
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, sweetheart.

399
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,073
Hug.

400
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,517
Oh, Jesus Christ,
you're breaking my neck.

401
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,115
Lee?

402
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,468
Yeah,
Hi, hon.

403
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,032
Hey.

404
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,314
Did you have a good time?

405
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,152
Yeah, really good.
Where's your mother?

406
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,589
They just left.
Oh, no.

407
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,517
Yeah, she's sad
to miss you, too.

408
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,716
There's always next time.
Did you get any sleep?

409
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,553
Oh, yeah. It's all rest
when my mother's here.

410
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,154
That's too bad.
Hi, Kary.

411
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,037
Hi, Daddy.

412
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,394
Dad...

413
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,754
I'm putting you down.
Relax.

414
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,592
I'm just giving you a kiss.

415
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,551
Honey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, Karen. Karen.

416
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,232
I almost dropped you
on your head.

417
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,038
I'm making
a hair salon.

418
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,833
Oh, yeah?
It's really good.

419
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,638
You want to cut my hair?

420
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,995
It's just for girls.
I'm sorry.

421
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,355
It's all right.
I understand, sweetheart.

422
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,398
May I watch TV
to get some ideas?

423
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,629
- No.
- Yeah.

424
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,639
Go ahead.

425
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,239
Get off.

426
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,638
How you feeling?

427
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,990
Better.
Yeah?

428
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,230
Yeah.
You sound better.

429
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,709
So, did you guys actually
use the fishing tackle?

430
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,995
Yeah, we really did.

431
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,755
Patty got a humongous bluefish.
Eighteen pounds.

432
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,671
Oh, yeah?
That's awesome.

433
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,800
I never seen anybody so happy
in my whole life. Aww.

434
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
It's nice in here.

435
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,350
You keep it nice.
What a homemaker. Fuck off.

436
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,998
All right.

437
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,640
Get away from me.
Stop it.

438
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,678
Mmm, don't.
Stop, please.

439
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,432
I'm sick.

440
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,953
Okay.

441
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,268
For real,
get off of me.

442
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,269
Hi, Stanny.

443
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,998
Oh, God.
Let him alone, please.

444
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,120
How come you're not crying?
I just got him settled.

445
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,936
Just got him settled?
What did you get him settled for?

446
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,440
Lee, don't pick him up. Oh, what
do you mean don't pick him up.

447
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,518
If he's not crying, leave well enough
alone. "Leave well enough alone."

448
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,216
That's what me and your Mummy should've
done instead of getting married.

449
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,233
Oh, shut up. Then you wouldn't be here.
Your sisters wouldn't be here.

450
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,676
I could watch the football game in my
own living room with peace and quiet.

451
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,672
You know what?
You go fuck yourself.

452
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,274
Oh, jeez, Louise.
Hey, kiddo.

453
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,432
Oh, my God, you're very handsome,
you know that?

454
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,431
See that?

455
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,511
I didn't make him cry.

456
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,749
Lay down.
Yeah.

457
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,233
He's not crying 'cause I
know how to handle him.

458
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,671
How is he?
How's Joe?

459
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,638
He's fine.
You know, he's all right.

460
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,756
He's doing all right.

461
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,832
And you didn't run out of beer?
You got through the day okay?

462
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,273
Oh, yeah.

463
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,590
We were very temperate.

464
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,558
I don't know why you guys bother
getting on the frigging boat.

465
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,835
What do you mean?
Because we love the sea.

466
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,434
Oh, yeah? How many beers
did you have on the sea?

467
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,471
Eight.
Eight?

468
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,154
Yep, eight
over a seven-hour period.

469
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,556
Which...
Well, I am well impressed.

470
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,789
...is...

471
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,632
1.1428572 beers an hour.

472
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,314
What, it's like you didn't even
have anything to drink at all.

473
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,675
Yeah, I told you
I was cutting down.

474
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,638
Oh, God, no. What do you
think you're going to do?

475
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,393
I guess I'm going
to take a shower.

476
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,232
Randi, I swear to God.

477
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,276
You should've seen
his face.

478
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,834
He was so happy.

479
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,878
It was like when we took the
girls on the Merry Go Round.

480
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,479
It was just pure happiness.

481
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,955
Oh.

482
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,395
Oh, come on, I'm sick.
I'm sick.

483
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,118
I'm really...

484
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,113
Really, babe,
deeply sick.

485
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,191
It actually makes it
hard to breathe.

486
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,910
He's not at school?
I thought school let out...

487
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,176
I'm pretty sure he would have...
What?

488
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,509
I'm sorry.
Paul, my phone is...

489
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,318
Sorry, say that again.
That's all right.

490
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,736
I'm pretty sure he would've left
for hockey practice by now.

491
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,432
He's on the hockey team?

492
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,590
Yeah, yeah.
He's doing real well, too.

493
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,750
Hey, how's Joe doing?
He going to be okay?

494
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
Yeah, he's fine.

495
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,717
Where's the practice?
Is it at the school?

496
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,796
No, they practice
at Gloucester.

497
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,279
They practice
in the Gloucester...

498
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,316
I'm sorry, it's not at the school?
No.

499
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,470
What?
Can you hear me?

500
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,949
The phone... That's all right.
Can you hear me?

501
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,871
Yeah.
It's at Gloucester, okay?

502
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,594
I understand. Yeah, we play
with the Rockport team.

503
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,632
But they're the league team. Okay,
I understand. Thank you, Paul.

504
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,536
Yeah, sure thing. Hey, give
Joe my regards, all right?

505
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,595
I will.

506
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,318
What's up?

507
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,834
Uh, Joe Chandler's
in the hospital again.

508
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,319
Oh, how awful.
Yeah.

509
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,079
Who was on the phone?
That was Lee Chandler.

510
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,192
Lee Chandler?
The very one.

511
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,152
Hey.

512
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,149
Hey, hey.
Knock it off.

513
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,117
Chandler.

514
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,428
Knock it off.

515
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,839
One more time
and you're out.

516
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,911
You understand that, Chandler?
One more time.

517
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,228
Aw, fuck me.

518
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,670
What's that?
Fuck my fucking ass.

519
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,616
All right, you are out.
Chandler, you're benched.

520
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,834
All right.

521
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,672
Ask me if I give a shit.

522
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,159
What's that?

523
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,358
Coach, that's his uncle.

524
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,919
His father
must be in the hospital.

525
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,877
Whose father?
Chandler's?

526
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,336
Yeah, he only comes around
when Mr. Chandler's in the hospital.

527
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,874
He's got congestive heart failure.
Patrick's dad.

528
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,439
So that's Lee Chandler?

529
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,874
The Lee Chandler, huh?

530
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,120
Yeah, but coach, you know
that story's bullshit, right?

531
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,559
Total bullshit, coach.

532
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,399
You guys want to watch
the language? Sorry.

533
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,392
All right mind, your own business
for a little while, huh?

534
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,869
Take a break.
Get a water.

535
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,516
All right, show's over.

536
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,118
Come on, let's go, let's go.

537
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,428
You all right, brother?

538
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,034
Take these sticks back,
would you?

539
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,515
Line it up again.

540
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,669
Come on, let's go.

541
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,394
I have to go to the hospital
and sign some more papers.

542
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,118
Do you want to see him?

543
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,112
I don't know.
Why?

544
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,758
What does he look like?

545
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,358
He looks like he's dead.

546
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,391
I mean, he doesn't look
like he's sleeping, or anything.

547
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,591
But he doesn't look
gross, either.

548
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,433
I don't know.

549
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,919
Well... you don't have to.

550
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,832
I wanted to see him.

551
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,758
Maybe you don't want that image
in your memory. I don't...

552
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,633
It's up to you.

553
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,195
What do you want to do?

554
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,679
Want me to take you home?

555
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,077
You want me
to decide for you?

556
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,868
Let's just go.

557
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,680
What the fuck are you doing?
I just said let's go inside.

558
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,936
No, you just said, "Let's just go",
and then you get out of the car...

559
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,474
Okay, I meant let's go inside.
What's your problem?

560
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,673
My problem is I could've ripped your fucking leg off.
Okay, I'm sorry I misused the English language.

561
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,119
I'm sorry, Uncle Lee.

562
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,316
I'm sorry, too.
I just got scared.

563
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,352
Yep. Okay.
Thank you.

564
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,598
Of course.

565
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,754
You got to hit
the bleeper.

566
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,871
I don't have a bleeper.

567
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,511
I'll do it.
There's a code.

568
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,679
Hey, is it okay if I invite
some of my friends over?

569
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,352
I told them
I would call them.

570
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,995
Go ahead. And can we get some pizza?
There's nothing to eat here.

571
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,399
Okay.

572
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,479
What kind would you like?

573
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,790
Any kind is fine.
Thank you.

574
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,638
At least he didn't suffer.

575
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,234
It's worse for the family,
but it's better for the person.

576
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,696
Well, he was a fucking great guy,
Patrick, I'll tell you that.

577
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,517
That's for sure.

578
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,034
You know, I remember
this one time he...

579
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,800
He took us all out in the
boat, like in sixth grade.

580
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,915
Yeah, I remember that.

581
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,592
And he made us wear
life preservers.

582
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,399
And I was like, you know,
"What's the difference, Mr. Chandler?

583
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,520
The boat sinks in this weather,
we're dead anyways."

584
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,360
Yeah, I remember that.
And then he was like...

585
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,193
"The life jacket's to make it easier
on the sharks when you go over."

586
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,191
Fucking smart ass,
I swear to God.

587
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,635
Yeah, he really liked
those shark jokes.

588
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,551
He was funny, man.

589
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,599
Yeah. He was gentle,
too, you know?

590
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,955
Like his son.

591
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,316
There's this former
starship captain, all right?

592
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,994
This former starship captain...
With the Star Trek again?

593
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,793
Will you shut the fuck up?
Fuck you. Star Trek sucks.

594
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,313
You fucking retard.

595
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,312
Star Trek is one of the classical
pillars of modern entertainment.

596
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,709
Tell me about Star Trek,
enlighten me, motherfucker.

597
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,496
I'll tell you this. How long
have I been friends with you?

598
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,476
How you doing, baby?
I'm okay.

599
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,296
Enough is enough, okay?
It just started.

600
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,117
How dare you?
Will you shut up?

601
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,358
Fuck Star Trek. Every sci-fi classic
film you like is based on Star Trek.

602
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,471
Star Trek is bullshit.
Star Trek is retarded.

603
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,516
Then Road Warrior,
Then the Matrix.

604
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,715
Retarded as shit.

605
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,920
I love Star Trek, all right?
How dare you.

606
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,309
Ask Patrick.
He loves them.

607
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,136
Patrick, what do you think
about Star Trek? Ask Patrick.

608
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,833
I can't believe we're talking
about Star Trek right now.

609
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,718
I like Star Trek.

610
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,074
Thank you.

611
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,796
Hey, Uncle Lee.

612
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,429
Is it okay if Silvie sleeps over?
Dad always let her.

613
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,670
Then what
are you asking me for?

614
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,639
No reason.

615
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,033
Thanks.

616
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,678
Uh, not that it would
come up or anything,

617
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,196
but her parents think she stays
downstairs when she stays over.

618
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,159
If it comes up for some reason, can you
just say she stayed in the downstairs room?

619
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,279
I don't even know them.
Yeah, you do.

620
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,920
It's the McGanns.
Frank and Pat McGann.

621
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,758
Oh, that's Silvie McGann?
Yeah.

622
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,439
Okay.
So...

623
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,638
Do you mind saying
she stayed downstairs?

624
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,399
Like, if they call
or something? Okay.

625
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,156
Am I supposed to tell you
to use a condom?

626
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,151
No, I...

627
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,476
Is that what Joe would say?

628
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,312
No.
I mean, yeah.

629
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,233
Yeah, we've had
"the discussion" and everything.

630
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,155
So...
Okay, good.

631
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,629
Yeah, just let me know
if we're making too much noise.

632
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,959
Okay.

633
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Uh...

634
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,272
Do you think I should call my
mom to tell her about Dad?

635
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,638
No, I wouldn't, Patty.

636
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,958
Yeah. I mean, uh, nobody
even knows where she is.

637
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,109
Yeah.

638
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,953
Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just
curious what you thought.

639
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,350
Anyway...
Good night, Uncle Lee.

640
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,953
Good night.

641
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,952
Shut up.

642
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,871
Hey, shut up, shut up.
Hey, Elise.

643
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,389
Shit.

644
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,879
Hey.

645
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,069
Come on.

646
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,152
Lee, you want to take Patty
upstairs and get him washed up?

647
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,799
Come on, kid.
Go on now.

648
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,996
Everything will be all right.
I'll be up in a minute.

649
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,435
Go on upstairs, Patty.
Everything will be okay.

650
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,909
I thought it was wonderful
that you dropped that ball.

651
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,832
Oh, shit.

652
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,319
Go on.

653
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,838
Shut the fuck up.

654
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,472
Beverly, Massachusetts.
Gallagher Funeral Home please.

655
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,549
Morning.

656
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,198
Hi.

657
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,872
Yes, hi, my name
is Lee Chandler.

658
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,158
My brother Joseph Chandler is
at the Beverly Hospital morgue.

659
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,233
I'm wondering who I need to talk
to about making arrangements.

660
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,034
Yeah, thank you.

661
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,078
Yes.

662
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,475
Yes, I just spoke...

663
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,790
Yes, my name
is Lee Chandler.

664
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,633
My brother's
at the Beverly Hospital morgue.

665
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,675
Yes.

666
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,075
Okay.

667
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,792
I understand.
I'm...

668
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,558
I'm calling to find out exactly what
I need to do to make arrangements

669
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,954
for the next step.

670
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,036
I see.
Okay, thank you.

671
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,797
Can I have a napkin?
Yes.

672
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,192
That's right. But what do you
I got to do to get his...

673
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,276
To get his body over to...

674
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,352
Excuse me, Mr. Chandler. I don't think
Patrick needs to be here for this.

675
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,749
No, I'm all right.

676
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,875
I don't understand.

677
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,316
So why is it more to drive
his body to Manchester?

678
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,392
You going to take the highway for seven
minutes, that's why it costs more?

679
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,119
What does it cost
if the hearse takes 127?

680
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,997
Jesus.
Like, that's his focus?

681
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,230
He's all right.

682
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,511
Thanks, Uncle Lee.
You're welcome.

683
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,550
Thanks, Mr. Chandler.
You're welcome.

684
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,194
So...

685
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,078
We're going to forget
about the language.

686
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,954
We're going to forget
about the fists.

687
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,271
But I want you take
a few days off of practice.

688
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,715
I don't want you
on the ice.

689
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,751
Well, to tell you
the honest truth, sir,

690
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,398
I could really use
the distraction.

691
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,040
The ice is not
a distraction.

692
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,675
When you're on the ice,
you got to be there.

693
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,079
Okay, so take a couple
days off and we'll talk.

694
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,190
Listen,

695
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,239
when I was your age,
I lost my dad, too.

696
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,389
So...

697
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,389
I know what
you're going through.

698
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,154
If you want
to come in and talk,

699
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,153
or you want somebody
to spill your guts to,

700
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,276
or throw the bull around,

701
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,351
the door's open.

702
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,554
You mind if I put
some music on? No.

703
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,958
You like these guys?

704
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,116
The lead guitar is weak, but
otherwise they're pretty good.

705
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,437
I don't know, they all
sound the same to me.

706
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,633
Where we going?

707
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,517
Got to go to the lawyer.

708
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,192
What for?

709
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,236
Read your father's will.

710
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,792
Do I have to be there?

711
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,633
I don't think so, but I think
you're supposed to be.

712
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,755
Who do you think
he left the boat to?

713
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,796
I'm sure
he left you everything.

714
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,476
I don't understand.

715
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,159
Which... part are you
having trouble with?

716
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,872
Well, I can't be
his guardian.

717
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,313
Well...

718
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,148
Uh...
I mean I can't.

719
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,869
Well, naturally I assumed that Joe
had discussed all this with you.

720
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,188
No.

721
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,999
He didn't.

722
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,393
No.

723
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,593
I-I...

724
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,591
Sorry, I have to say
I'm somewhat taken aback.

725
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,750
He can't live with me.
I live in one room.

726
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,070
Well, but Joe has provided
for Patrick's upkeep.

727
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,869
Food, cloths, etcetera. And the house
and the boat are owned outright.

728
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,554
I can't commute from Boston
every day until he turns 18.

729
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,870
I think the idea
was that you would relocate.

730
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,197
Relocate to where?
Here? Well, if you look...

731
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,909
As you can see, your brother worked
everything out extremely carefully.

732
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,873
But he can't...
He can't have meant that.

733
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,309
Uh, he's allowed
up to $5,000...

734
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,879
to pay
for moving expenses.

735
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,954
And there's a small amount
set aside for you to draw from

736
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,191
as personal income
while you settle in.

737
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,158
I mean, assuming
that you accept.

738
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,117
What about my Uncle Donny
and Aunt Teresa?

739
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,795
Joe didn't feel that Patrick really had
any special relationship or feeling.

740
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,393
I don't understand.

741
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,597
Now, as I think you know, they've
moved out to Wisconsin, I believe.

742
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,438
Minnesota.
Minnesota

743
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,393
Minnetonka, Minnesota.
That's right.

744
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,558
It was my impression that you'd spent
a lot of time here over the years.

745
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,636
I was just a backup.

746
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,598
I came up here to look after Patty,
yeah, if Joe was in the hospital

747
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,671
after my father
couldn't do it. We...

748
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,830
It was supposed
to be Donny.

749
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,158
I'm just a backup.

750
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,509
Well, I can just repeat
that I'm astonished

751
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,239
that Joe didn't run this by you,
thorough as he was.

752
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,834
Yeah, because he knew what I would
say if he would have asked.

753
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,109
Hey.

754
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,151
You want to keep it down,
you fucking morons?

755
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,310
My kids are sleeping.

756
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,432
I am so sorry.
I mean...

757
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,229
Lee, you want to get these fucking
pinheads out of my house please?

758
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,077
Yeah, I do.
I mean, I really do.

759
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,952
She can't talk
to us that way.

760
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,399
Yeah.

761
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,517
Hey.

762
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,551
I'm not fucking around.

763
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,232
It's 2:00
in the fucking morning.

764
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,040
Get these fucking assholes dressed
and get them the fuck out of here.

765
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,238
We're dressed.

766
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,039
She didn't mean it.
She'll apologize later.

767
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,073
They're already left.

768
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,789
Lee...

769
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,310
Thanks for hosting, kid.
Tell Randi we're sorry.

770
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,834
- Drink and drive.
- We're so sorry.

771
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,798
You see Jupiter?
Keep you eyes on the road.

772
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,671
Hey, Tommy.

773
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,518
Goodnight, Joe.

774
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,795
Sorry again.

775
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,349
Go ahead.
Shoot for it, you fucking idiot.

776
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,271
Look, there's the North Star
right there.

777
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,191
Right there.

778
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,354
It's due north.

779
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,791
I'll clean up
in the morning.

780
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,075
Did you see Jupiter,
you fucking asshole?

781
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,196
Come on.

782
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,834
Fuck you.
Come on.

783
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Lee...

784
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,516
Lee, nobody can appreciate
what you've been through.

785
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,669
If I can say that.

786
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,314
And if you really feel
like you can't take this on,

787
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,518
well, that's,
that's your right.

788
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,272
So who would get him?

789
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,353
Patrick, can I get you
a can of soda or anything?

790
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,839
No, thank you.

791
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,395
Well, I don't know what's
happening with Patrick's mother.

792
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,118
No. I'm not sure
where she is.

793
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,310
What kind condition she's in.
No.

794
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,433
We can't do that.

795
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,515
Oh, God!

796
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,116
My kids are in there!
My kids are in there!

797
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,349
Oh, God!

798
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,871
Look, Lee...

799
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,393
why don't you just...

800
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,631
Thank you, Wes.
I'll be in touch.

801
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,233
I'm-I'm here.

802
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,272
We were partying pretty hard.

803
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,112
There was beer.

804
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,796
And someone was passing around
a joint and there was cocaine.

805
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,519
Cocaine?
Yes.

806
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,352
Okay, go ahead.

807
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,913
Uh, anyway, our bedroom
is in the downstairs,

808
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,355
and the kids
sleep upstairs,

809
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,432
so Randi makes
everyone leave

810
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,511
around 2:00...

811
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,431
or three AM.

812
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,351
And then...

813
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,791
she goes back to bed.

814
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,474
So, I go upstairs
to check on the kids,

815
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,915
and it's fucking freezing
up stairs,

816
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,470
but I can't use the central heat
because it dries out Randi's sinuses,

817
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,471
and she gives her
really bad headaches.

818
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,348
So I go downstairs
and put a fire in the fireplace,

819
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,989
and I sit down to watch TV,
but there's no more beer.

820
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,558
I'm still jumping around
like a jackrabbit.

821
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,713
So I put a couple fire
logs in the fire and I...

822
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,634
Just to warm up the house
when I was gone.

823
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,439
And then... I am going
to the mini-mart,

824
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,954
but I'm too wasted
and I don't want to drive.

825
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,078
So I walk. It's about
20 minutes each way.

826
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,751
And about halfway there,

827
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:17,072
and I can't remember if I put
the screen on the fireplace.

828
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,032
I figure it's okay.

829
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,990
So I just keep going
to the store.

830
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,310
And, uh, that's it.

831
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,317
Log must've rolled out
onto the floor.

832
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,393
And the firemen said
they pulled Randi out.

833
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,278
She was passed out
downstairs.

834
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,998
And...

835
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,955
Then the furnace blew, and they
couldn't go back in again.

836
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,033
And that's all
I remember.

837
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,151
Okay, Lee.
That's all for now.

838
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,153
We'll call you if anything else
comes up we want to ask you about.

839
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,276
Assuming the forensics
bail you out,

840
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,636
which I'm assuming
they will...

841
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,028
So what?
That's it?

842
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,156
Look, Lee, you made
a horrible mistake.

843
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,913
Like a million
other people did last night.

844
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,314
Not going
to crucify you.

845
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,036
It's not a crime to forget to put
the screen on the fireplace.

846
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,671
So I can go?

847
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,992
Unless something else comes up we
don't know about already, yeah.

848
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,320
You got anyone to give you
a ride back home?

849
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,834
Is Joe here,
is your dad here?

850
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,714
Yeah.

851
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,953
Okay.

852
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,673
Please.

853
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,193
All right, let's go.

854
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,712
Bye.

855
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,496
Where are we going,
the orphanage?

856
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,636
Shut up.
What the hell did I do?

857
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,199
Just be quiet.

858
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,559
All right.
We got a lot to do.

859
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,536
What about the boat?
We got to talk to George about it.

860
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,136
There's no use hanging onto it if no one's
going to use it. I'm going to use it.

861
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,913
It's got to be maintained.
I'm maintaining it.

862
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,077
You can't maintain it by yourself.
Why not? It's my boat now, isn't it?

863
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,880
Because you're a minor. You can't
take it out alone. I'm the trustee.

864
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,110
So what does "trustee" mean?

865
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,873
I'm in charge of handling everything
for you until you turn 18.

866
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,976
Does that mean you're allowed to
sell it if I don't want you to?

867
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,594
I don't know.
But I'd definitely consider it.

868
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,636
No fucking way.

869
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,199
Don't be
so goddamn sure of yourself.

870
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,456
There's nobody to run it. You're 16
years old. I get my license this year.

871
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,616
Doesn't matter.
You're still a minor.

872
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,336
You can't run a commercial vessel by
yourself. It's a big fucking expense.

873
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,576
I'm the one who's going to manage
it, and I'm not going to be here.

874
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,376
Who gives a fuck where you are?
Patty, I swear to God,

875
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,776
I'm going to knock
your fucking block off.

876
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,030
Great parenting. What?
What did you say?

877
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,639
I said great parenting.
Fuck you.

878
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,915
Mind your fucking business,
fucking asshole.

879
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,833
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, it's okay.

880
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,309
I'm going to smash your fucking
face, you fucking asshole.

881
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,789
It's okay, it's okay.
Thank you, thank you. It's okay.

882
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,230
Uncle Lee, are you fundamentally unsound?
Fucking asshole.

883
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,311
Get in the fucking car.

884
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,216
I can't obey your orders
until you unlock the door.

885
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,071
Shut up.

886
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,035
It's not like the
motor's going to die tomorrow,

887
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,839
but Joe said it keeps breaking
down like a son of a bitch.

888
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,194
Yeah, but we...

889
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,669
We were going to take a
look at it this weekend.

890
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,557
Things are
a little bit up in the air.

891
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,433
No, I can take care of it as far as
general maintenance is concerned.

892
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,216
But that motor's going
to go at some point.

893
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,038
I'm taking care of it. There's
no allotment for a new motor.

894
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,200
Unless, George, you know
someone who wants to buy it.

895
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,518
Wait a second.
I'm not selling it.

896
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,352
We're going to be
in Boston anyway.

897
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,193
What? Since when are we
supposed to be in Boston?

898
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,555
Just take it easy.
Well, whatever you decide,

899
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,835
it's going to bleed you dry
just sitting here.

900
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,319
We don't know exactly
we're doing.

901
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,234
Well, you know, he can always stay with
us if he wants to come up weekends.

902
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,311
Do you want to be
his guardian?

903
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,392
Well... He doesn't want
to be my guardian.

904
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,313
We're trying to lose
some kids at this point.

905
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,560
We're just working out logistics.
That's pretty good.

906
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,513
Jesus Christ, you want to stop?
We've always got a sofa for him.

907
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,656
You know that, right? George,
that's all right. I know that.

908
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,798
He's welcome any time.
I know. Thank you.

909
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,835
Are you brain-damaged?
You can't just talk to people that.

910
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,016
You don't want to be my
guardian, that's fine with me.

911
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,758
It's not that.
It's just the logistics.

912
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,070
I just got to work it
all out, I swear. How?

913
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,400
By sending me to Wonkatonka,
Minnesota with Uncle Donny?

914
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,750
Minnetonka, Minnesota. Okay, Minnetonka,
Minnesota. Same difference.

915
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,758
What about my mother?

916
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,472
The judge would never
let that happen.

917
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,910
And anyway, no one knows
where she is. I do.

918
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,151
She's in Connecticut.
At least she was last year.

919
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,477
Since when do you know that?
Well, she emailed me last year.

920
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,034
So I emailed her back.
You know, email?

921
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,833
Did your father know you were in
touch with her? Are you kidding?

922
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,792
Could we walk?
I'm freezing.

923
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,552
All I know is...
I know, I know, I know.

924
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,393
She's a drunk, she's insane,
she let the dogs shit on the floor.

925
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,869
It's the last thing your father
ever would've wanted.

926
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,275
Suddenly you care
what he would've wanted?

927
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,753
Where to now?

928
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,718
The funeral parlor.
Great.

929
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,389
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are we going?

930
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,639
It's in Beverly.

931
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,433
There's no funeral homes
in Manchester? No.

932
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,436
The cemetery's here.

933
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,112
Let's just get this done.

934
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:01,433
Dude, what is with that guy and
the big Serious and Somber Act?

935
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,154
I don't know.

936
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,915
But seriously, does he not realize that
people know he does this every single day?

937
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,720
I don't know.

938
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,437
Why can't we bury him?

939
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,078
It's too cold.

940
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,296
The ground is too hard.
They'll bury him in the Spring.

941
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,992
So what do they do
with him until then?

942
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:20,908
They put him in a freezer.

943
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,950
Are you serious?

944
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,393
Yes.

945
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,152
That really freaks me out.

946
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,356
It doesn't matter.

947
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,594
Wait a minute.

948
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,909
I think I parked the car
the other way. Sorry.

949
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,200
What about one of those
mini-steam shovels?

950
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,552
What? I once saw one of those
mini-steam shovels one time

951
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,153
in a graveyard
in New Haven.

952
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,470
It dug a perfect little hole
in about two seconds.

953
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,400
I don't really know how
you would get a hold of one.

954
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,997
Or how much
it would cost.

955
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,911
Why can't we just look
into it?

956
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,990
Because you can't use heavy equipment
in the historic Rosedale Cemetery.

957
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,229
Why not?

958
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,920
Because there are very important
people who are buried there,

959
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,629
and their descendants don't want steam
shovels vibrating over their dead bodies.

960
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,995
Why can't we just bury him
someplace else?

961
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,275
'Cause that's the plot
that Joe bought.

962
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,631
Don't ask me why, but if you want
make some other arrangements,

963
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,216
you want to find
someplace else to bury him,

964
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,376
you want to talk
to the mortician,

965
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,616
and you want to call up Sacred
Heart and talk to Father Martin

966
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,376
and then find out how much that's going
to cost and make all those arrangements,

967
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,216
be my guest, otherwise,
let's just leave it, okay?

968
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,629
I'm just saying I don't like
him being in a freezer.

969
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,392
Yeah.

970
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,833
I don't like it, either,
but it isn't him 'cause he's gone.

971
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,831
It's just his body.

972
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,751
I'm just saying
it kind of freaks me out.

973
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,389
Oh, goddammit,
where did I park the car?

974
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,870
Yeah, I don't know, but I wish you'd figure
it out 'cause I'm freezing my ass off.

975
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,911
You don't have
a normal winter coat?

976
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,149
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

977
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,674
Why don't you wear gloves
with real fingers on them?

978
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:07,836
Oh, God, fuck. Oh, fuck, where'd
I park this motherfucking car?

979
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,719
Damn, it's cold.

980
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,456
Why? What's the matter
with your winter jacket?

981
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,311
Seriously, Patty?
Just turn the heat on.

982
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,556
It's on already.
Turn it up a little.

983
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,536
It's all the way up. It's blowing
fucking freezing air on me.

984
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,677
It takes a minute to warm up. What
year did you get this thing, 1928?

985
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,456
Where's the horse that goes with this
fucking car? Maybe he can breathe on us.

986
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,038
I swear to God...
I know.

987
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,296
Why don't we keep my dad in
here for the next three months?

988
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,240
You'd save a fucking fortune. Will you
shut the fuck up about the freezer?

989
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,616
You want me to have
a nervous breakdown

990
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,536
because there's undertakers and a funeral?
Who cares?

991
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,152
No, I don't.

992
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,835
Okay, It's getting warmer.
I got band practice.

993
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,320
Can you drive me home so I can get my stuff
and take me over to my girlfriend's house?

994
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,039
Sure.

995
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,136
Is this is the same girl
who was over at the house?

996
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,958
No, that was Silvie,
and this is Sandy.

997
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,480
And they don't know
about each other,

998
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,358
so, uh, please don't say
anything in case it comes up.

999
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,313
I won't.

1000
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,829
Do you actually have sex
with these girls?

1001
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,480
Well, we don't just play
computer games.

1002
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,835
With both of them?

1003
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:36,438
Well, with Sandy's mom here, it's sort of
uh, strictly just like basement business.

1004
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,875
What does that mean?

1005
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,991
It means
I'm working on it.

1006
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,670
♪ I got to run ♪

1007
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,992

1009
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,037

1010
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,634
Stop. Joel, man,
what are you doing?

1011
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,312
What did I do?

1012
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,675
You're way behind, man.
No, I'm not.

1013
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,478
You're a little behind.

1014
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,471
You got to stay
with the bass.

1015
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,869
Come on, man. Just stay with
me, all right? Let's go.

1016
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,712
All right. I'm sorry.
Yeah, come on.

1017
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,512
Come on, let's go.

1018
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,158
All right, guys,
let's go again.

1019
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,510
Otto, are you good?
Are you good, buddy?

1020
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,431
We are Stentorian.

1021
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,760
One, two, three.

1022
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,438
♪ I got to run ♪

1023
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,838

1026
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,836
Hi.
Are you Lee?

1027
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,076
I'm Jill, Sandy's mom.

1028
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,513
I think they're wrapping up.

1029
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,478
Do you want to come inside
and have a beer or something?

1030
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,434
No.

1031
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,478
That's all right.
Thank you.

1032
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,269
I wanted to offer my
condolences about Joe.

1033
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,238
He was a terrific guy.

1034
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,154
There's not too many like him.
He was a wonderful father.

1035
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,912
Thank you.

1036
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,513
I was... I was going to ask Patrick
if he wants to stay for supper,

1037
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,750
if that's okay with you.

1038
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,400
You want to join us?
I made way too much.

1039
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,833
Oh.

1040
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,795
Uh...

1041
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,235
That's all right. I'll just
come back and get him.

1042
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,550
What time
should I come back?

1043
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,994
Oh, I don't know.
Nine, nine thirty.

1044
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,753
They're going to do their
homework together. Supposedly.

1045
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,478
Ha, ha, ha.

1046
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,950
All right.
I'll come back at 9:30.

1047
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,112
Okay. Well, you change your
mind in the next ten minutes,

1048
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,474
we're right inside.

1049
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,879
Okay, thanks.

1050
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,676
Jesus Christ.
How do you unbuckle this?

1051
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,352
I'm scraping the skin
off my knuckles.

1052
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,998
Just take your hand out.

1053
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,115
Ow.

1054
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,256
Would you please just take
your hand out of my cunt?

1055
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,679
Okay, okay.

1056
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,278
Oh, we're taking
our pants off?

1057
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,033
I'm taking my pants off.
I don't know what you're doing.

1058
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,752
I'm taking my pants off.

1059
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,874
Come on.

1060
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,439
You got to take your shoe off first.
Jesus.

1061
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,112
I'm trying.

1062
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,998
Hey, kids?
Come on, have some dinner.

1063
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,320
Thanks, mom. We'll be right down.
Thanks, Jill.

1064
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,034
One second.
I just got to log off.

1065
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,997
Would you shut up?
She's not retarded.

1066
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,634
Why are you picking on me?
I'm not picking on you.

1067
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,228
You'll get me in trouble.
I'm not going to get in trouble.

1068
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,788
What are you trying to do?

1069
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,038
How's the math homework?

1070
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,475
It's good.
Very frustrating.

1071
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,788
Good.

1072
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,711
Yeah, those algorithms
are a bitch.

1073
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,993
This is really good, Jill.

1074
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,559
Thank you, Patrick.

1075
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,517
This is a homemade
Cabonara sauce?

1076
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,398
Jesus.
Shut up. No.

1077
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,277
You could've fooled me.

1078
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,759
Jesus.

1079
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,075
What? What?
You're such a kiss ass.

1080
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,160
Sandy.

1081
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,555
Because I appreciate
your mother's cooking?

1082
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,398
Good night.
Good night.

1083
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,816
Aren't you going to ask what happened?
I don't want to know.

1084
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,319
I guess not.

1085
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,189
Come on.

1086
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,238
Begeron closes, dinks and scores.

1087
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,757
Alex Dean.

1088
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:34,235
- Hello?
- Hello, Lee?

1089
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,470
It's Randi.

1090
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,634
Hello? Yeah, sorry, I'm here.
Hi, how are you?

1091
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,910
I'm okay.
How are you? Good.

1092
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,116
I was just calling...

1093
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,152
George told me about Joe. I just
wanted to call and say I'm sorry.

1094
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,753
I hope
you don't mind me calling.

1095
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,308
No, it's fine. Thank you, I don't mind.
How are you?

1096
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,789
Not so good right now.

1097
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,997
I guess we should've seen it coming,
but it's still hard to believe.

1098
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,308
Yeah.

1099
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,550
How's Patrick doing?
He's good.

1100
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,558
Beyond the obvious, obviously.
He's okay, he's fine.

1101
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,576
I mean, I don't know, you know
how kids are. It's hard to tell.

1102
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,875
He doesn't really open up
with me, but he seems fine.

1103
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,150
He's got a lot of friends, so.
Well, that's good.

1104
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,719
Good, yeah.

1105
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,519
So, I don't know
if you planned a service, yet,

1106
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,416
but I was also going to ask
you if you wouldn't mind,

1107
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,477
I'd like to be there,
if it's okay with you.

1108
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,876
Yeah, it's fine. I don't mind.
Okay, thank you.

1109
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,230
It would mean a lot to me.
You should come.

1110
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,436
I'll let you know
when it's going to be.

1111
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,112
Thank you.

1112
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,118
So, can I ask...

1113
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,999
How are you?

1114
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,271
I don't know.
How are you?

1115
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,351
I don't know.

1116
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,556
We're doing pretty well.

1117
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,760
I should probably tell you.
I'm going to be...

1118
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,831
Actually, I'm pregnant.

1119
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,279
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1120
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,555
You know,
like ready to pop.

1121
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,958
Oh, I didn't know that.

1122
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,710
I didn't know
if I should tell you, but...

1123
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,789
No, it's fine. Congratulations.
Thank you.

1124
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,713
You would probably deduce it
for yourself when you see me.

1125
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,313
Yeah.

1126
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,030
So I, you know, I just
wanted to say, you know...

1127
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,395
Actually, um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cut you off.

1128
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,913
I've just got to go...

1129
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,976
I just wanted to make sure it's okay
if me and Josh come to the funeral.

1130
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,992
It's totally okay.
Thank you, Lee.

1131
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,315
God bless.
Bye. So long.

1132
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,914
So, how you holding up?

1133
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,797
What's the matter?
No.

1134
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,269
I said how you holding up?
It's a stupid question.

1135
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,873
You get some food?

1136
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,837
Oh, I had some cheese.

1137
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,832
You had some cheese?
Asshole.

1138
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,616
I'll get you something.
I don't want anything.

1139
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,835
Hey, Janine.
Sure? Sure.

1140
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,751
Never mind.
What?

1141
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,840
Forget it.
Skip it.

1142
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,356
I can't hear a goddamn
word you're saying. What?

1143
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,670
Did Lee get food?
He didn't... What?

1144
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,830
Did Lee get food?
No.

1145
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,956
He doesn't want any.
We're good.

1146
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,519
Forget it.
He doesn't...

1147
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,670
We're fine.
He doesn't want any.

1148
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,231
Hey, is it okay
if I invite Silvie over?

1149
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,153
Uh, which one is she?

1150
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,318
She's the one
with the, uh, the brown hair.

1151
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,029
No.

1152
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,236
What do you mean, no?

1153
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,039
I don't like her. I don't want
her in the house right now.

1154
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,714
Why not? You don't even
have to talk to her.

1155
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,279
Sorry.

1156
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,874
Go to her house.
Call one of your friends.

1157
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,193
That's it.

1158
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,119
Would it be cool with your mom
if I came over there?

1159
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,951
I have no idea.

1160
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,158
Okay.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1161
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,390
Well, I can't stay there, either.

1162
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,873
Sorry about that.

1163
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,114
You going to stay in here?
Yeah, why not?

1164
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,949
I thought maybe you'd want
to stay in Dad's room. Hm?

1165
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,833
Why? You want me to?
No, it's just a better room.

1166
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,876
And he's not using it.

1167
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,793
Okay.
I'll stay in there.

1168
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,916
We're not going to be here
that much longer anyway.

1169
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,230
I'm not moving
to Boston, Uncle Lee.

1170
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,390
Well, I don't want to talk
about that right now.

1171
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,592
You said he left you money so you could
move. Yeah, but that doesn't mean...

1172
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,433
Anyway, what's in Boston?
You're a janitor.

1173
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,351
So what?
You could do that anywhere.

1174
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,880
There's plenty of toilets and
clogged-up drains all over town.

1175
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,816
I don't want to talk about it.
All my friends are here.

1176
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,956
I'm on the hockey team.
I'm on the basketball team.

1177
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,953
I got to maintain our boat now.
I work on George's boat two days a week.

1178
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,713
I got two girlfriends,
and I'm in a band.

1179
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,559
You're a janitor in Quincy. What the
hell do you care where you live?

1180
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,716
I got to go to sleep.
Good night.

1181
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,078
Where are you going
to stay tonight?

1182
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,593
I don't know.
A motel.

1183
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,716
What time
you going to call me?

1184
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,233
When I get to the motel.

1185
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,760
If I don't hear from you by 9:00,
I'm going to call the cops.

1186
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,109
You understand?
Yes, yes.

1187
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,070
Patrick, come say goodbye
to your Uncle Lee.

1188
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,077
That's okay. No, it's not.
Patrick.

1189
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,071
Coming.

1190
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,798
I'm going to see him.

1191
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,676
Bye, Uncle Lee.
So long.

1192
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,429
Patty? I think there's
something wrong with me.

1193
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,431
What do you mean, like what?
Are you sick?

1194
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,715
I don't know.

1195
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,193
I feel really weird.
I'm sick.

1196
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,788
I'm having a panic attack.
What do you mean?

1197
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,552
Hey.
I don't know.

1198
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,915
Can you get that shit
out of here please?

1199
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,190
Get rid of what?
I don't know. I don't know.

1200
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,271
The food?
I feel really weird.

1201
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,879
You want me
to get rid of the food?

1202
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,269
I don't know.
Patrick.

1203
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,073
Hey, do you want me to take you
to the hospital? I don't know.

1204
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,056
Do you want me to call your friends?
I don't know.

1205
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,957
What do you want me to do?
I don't know.

1206
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,988
Patty,
are you going to bed?

1207
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,354
Leave me alone.

1208
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,040
I don't think I should let you
keep the door shut. Just go away.

1209
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,997
I will.
Just open up the door.

1210
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,115
Fuck you.

1211
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,816
Jesus Christ. What's your problem?
I said open the door.

1212
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,056
Are you having a breakdown?
Should we take you to the hospital?

1213
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,833
No, no.
I'm just freaking out.

1214
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:22,754
Okay, fine. But I can't let you
freak out with the door closed.

1215
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:27,160
And if you're going to freak out every
time that you see a frozen chicken,

1216
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,576
I think we should go
to the hospital.

1217
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,919
I don't know
anything about this.

1218
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,959
I just don't like him
being in the freezer.

1219
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,474
You've expressed that
very clearly.

1220
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,080
I don't like it, either. But there's
nothing we can do about it.

1221
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,360
I'm not going to bother you. I'm going
to just sit here until you calm down.

1222
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,628
All right, I'm calmer now.
Would you please just go away?

1223
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,119
No.

1224
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,313
Cool.

1225
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,358
How much
are they paying you?

1226
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,232
Minimum wage
plus the room.

1227
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,193
All right.

1228
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,753
Let's go get
some furniture.

1229
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,637
I got furniture.

1230
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,480
No, you don't.

1231
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,909
This doesn't count
as furniture.

1232
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,991
This is not a room.

1233
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,720
Let's go get some furniture.
Get off my back.

1234
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,719
Patty.

1235
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,119
Come on, let's go.

1236
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,319
Let's go.

1237
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,478
There you go.

1238
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,074
All right.

1239
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,390
Better?

1240
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,754
Better.

1241
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,913
So listen.

1242
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,519
You can stay here
until your school lets out.

1243
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,073
That'll give me some time to set
things up in Boston better.

1244
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,720
Maybe you can do some stuff for
George in the summer if you want.

1245
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,194
And you don't get jerked out
of your life overnight.

1246
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,159
Okay?

1247
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,390
Are you asking
me or telling me?

1248
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,680
I'm telling you that's the best I can do. What
do you care whether it's okay with me or not?

1249
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:20,117
It's 45 minutes away. You can
come back here any time you want.

1250
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,719
It's an hour and a...
Is that a joke?

1251
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,576
It's an hour and a half at least.
No, it's not.

1252
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,352
An hour 15,
depending on traffic.

1253
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,776
You couldn't get from here to Quincy in half
an hour if you flew in a fucking spaceship.

1254
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,233
Okay, fuck it.

1255
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,511
I need lunch money.

1256
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,830
Hey, Patrick.
Hey, Patrick. Patrick.

1257
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,873
So, are you going
to Godspell?

1258
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,673
I'm thinking about it.
All right. Goodbye.

1259
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,190
Are those
your girlfriends, too?

1260
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,838
They wish.

1261
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,960
Doesn't George give you money
for working on his boat?

1262
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,792
Yeah, but I'm saving that.
For what?

1263
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,154
New motor.

1264
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:02,833
Are you going
to Godspell?

1265
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,239
Oh, come on.

1266
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,630
Oh, come on.

1267
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,269
Hello?

1268
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,237
Hello, Lee?

1269
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,152
Lee?

1270
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,148
Lee, is that you?

1271
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,310
Hello?

1272
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:17,113
What happened
to your hand?

1273
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,519
I cut it.

1274
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,034
Oh, for a minute there
I didn't know what happened.

1275
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,238
Is there some reason why you didn't
tell me my mom tried to call me?

1276
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,113
She wrote me
you hung up on her.

1277
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,473
She's in Essex.

1278
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,950
She wants me to come have
lunch and meet her fiancé.

1279
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,679
What did you think? She
couldn't get in touch with me?

1280
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,109
I hung up on her because I
didn't know what to say to her.

1281
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,680
And I didn't tell you because I
didn't know what to say to you.

1282
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,159
I'm sorry.

1283
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,310
You can't stop me
talking to her.

1284
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,436
I don't give a shit
what you do.

1285
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,040
No, but you won't let
my girlfriend stay over.

1286
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,588
You hate my mother so much you
won't even tell me she called.

1287
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,591
You'd rather drag me
to Quincy and ruin my life

1288
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,352
and let somebody else
be my guardian.

1289
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,318
There is nobody else.
I can live in Essex with my Mom.

1290
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,713
No, you can't.
She's not an alcoholic anymore.

1291
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,256
She wants me to stay with her,
then that solves all our problems.

1292
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:35,592
I can take the same bus to my same school
and keep all my friends and the boat,

1293
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:39,309
and you can go back to Boston and still
check in on me or whatever, if you want to.

1294
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,749
I can't do that.
Why not?

1295
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,638
Patty, I'm sorry
I hung up on her.

1296
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,199
I'll call her back.

1297
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,633
If she seems
semi-human to me,

1298
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,656
you can go and have lunch
with her and her fiancé.

1299
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:53,353
That's it. I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

1300
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,031
Okay, soon as we clear, open it
up and we'll see what we can do.

1301
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:09,439
Okay.

1302
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,357
Oh.
Lee?

1303
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,555
Hey.
Hey.

1304
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,640
What do you say?

1305
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,472
How are you?
Yeah, good. How are you?

1306
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,073
All right.
Yeah.

1307
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:32,237
I'm really sorry to hear about Joe.
Yeah, thanks.

1308
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,992
How's Patrick doing?
Good.

1309
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,310
Yeah? Good.
What's going on?

1310
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,000
You know, I'm back, I'm thinking
about staying through the summer.

1311
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,674
I was wondering if you had any work.
I could pick up some hours.

1312
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,760
Sure, sure.

1313
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,916
Walter's down in Boston, so...
Oh, he is?

1314
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,736
Yeah, he should be back tomorrow
if you want to come by.

1315
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,776
He's coming back up tomorrow?
Yeah, give him a call.

1316
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,155
Well, I will give him a call, yeah.
That's a good idea.

1317
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,992
Absolutely.
Okay, all right.

1318
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,672
Hey.
Yeah, all right.

1319
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,637
Good to see you.
Thanks, Jerry.

1320
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,637
I don't want to see him
in here again.

1321
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,718
So long, Patrick.

1322
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,557
How's the motor?

1323
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:19,916
George says the piston's going to go
right through the block any minute now.

1324
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,270
Unfortunately,
that's a problem.

1325
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,350
We can't afford to keep
the boat if we can't run it,

1326
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:28,280
and we can't run it
if it's got a broken motor.

1327
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,713
Let's take out a loan.

1328
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,313
And pay it back with what?

1329
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:34,233
We hire it out till we pay
the loan back, obviously.

1330
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:40,715
Unfortunately for you, I'm in charge
of your finances until you turn 21,

1331
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,110
and I'm not comfortable taking out
enormous loans on your behalf.

1332
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,434
I have band practice. Can you
drive me home to get my stuff,

1333
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,199
and then drive me over
to Sandy's house?

1334
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,792
Sure.

1335
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,096
Why don't you take
a Drivers' Ed course?

1336
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,953
Dad made me promise
not to drive till I was 17.

1337
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,275
Okay, we'll stick
with that then.

1338
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,990
Do you want
to stay for dinner?

1339
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,638
I think Sandy's mother
likes you.

1340
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:21,909
No, she doesn't.

1341
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,150
I happen to know
that she does.

1342
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,390
This could be good
for both of us.

1343
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,589
I'd really rather not.

1344
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:37,591
Well...

1345
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,776
can you at least just hang out
with her for half an hour

1346
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,315
so I can be alone with Sandy without her
mother knocking on the door every 20 seconds?

1347
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,515
Come on, man.

1348
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,192
All you got to do
is talk to her.

1349
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,896
Why can't you help me out
a little bit for once

1350
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:52,196
instead of dragging me to the lawyers
and the funeral parlor and the morgue?

1351
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,032
Anyway, she's really nice.

1352
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:58,876
♪ Tell me why ♪

1353
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,111
♪ Why ♪

1354
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:07,670
♪ Why do you need me ♪
♪ Why do you want me ♪

1355
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,433
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

1356
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,232
Otto. What?
I'm too slow?

1357
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,157
Too fast, man.
You're dragging.

1358
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,271
You're way too fast, man.
I'm too fast.

1359
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,936
Dude, you're like pulling out of
the fucking station ahead of me.

1360
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,757
Oh, my god, you guys.
Leave him alone.

1361
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,758
I'm like, are you serious about this
band, or what? Okay, all right.

1362
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,035
Just lay off him.
Get off my back.

1363
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,752
All right,
everybody just chill here.

1364
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,308
Let's just, um,
let's just go again.

1365
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,158
We are Stentorian.

1366
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,833
Patrick is one
of my favorite people.

1367
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,273
That's good.

1368
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,633
How's it going
up there, you guys?

1369
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,957
It's going fine.

1370
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:07,917
We're right in the middle
of something.

1371
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,912
We're just banging
out those compound fractions.

1372
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,511
At least we know
where they are, right?

1373
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,673
That's true.

1374
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,191
How many of those do you generally got
to go through before you pick a winner?

1375
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:28,716
I'd like to see you use one of these goddamn
things with all these interruptions.

1376
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:31,869
Oh, fuck. What happened?
Are you okay?

1377
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,155
I tripped over
your fucking doll house.

1378
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,958
Oh, my God,
did you break it?

1379
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,951
I don't know. I'm fine though,
by the way.

1380
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,759
Oh, my God. My grandmother gave me
that when I was five years old.

1381
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,976
It was literally her doll house
from when she was a little girl.

1382
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,479
What's it doing
on the fucking floor?

1383
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,790
It's a doll house.
That's where you play with it.

1384
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,518
Sandy, what is
going on up there?

1385
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,592
Nothing. Patrick just stubbed
his toe on Mummer's doll house.

1386
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:52,954
But it's okay.

1387
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:54,672
That doll house
belonged to my mother.

1388
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,320
If you're going
to smash it to pieces...

1389
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,119
Nobody is smashing it to pieces.
Don't worry Jill, I'm okay.

1390
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,031
My toe's going to be okay.

1391
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,993
Do you want to fuck me or not?
Yes.

1392
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:14,669
Could I get you
another beer, Lee?

1393
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:16,318
I'm good.

1394
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,118
Thank you.

1395
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:24,029
Would you excuse me, Lee,
one sec?

1396
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,314
Sure.

1397
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,513
Is it on?
Yes. It's a miracle.

1398
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,113
Okay, hurry up.

1399
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,470
One second please.
Get out of the way.

1400
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,437
I'm sorry.

1401
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,234
What's up?
I'm really sorry.

1402
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:59,356
I know
you're trying to work,

1403
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:01,550
but I can't sit down there
much longer.

1404
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,830
Why? What's the problem?
He won't talk.

1405
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,150
I've been trying to make
conversation for half an hour.

1406
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:10,393
I realize I'm not the most fascinating
person in the world, Oh, Mum.

1407
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,277
But it's very, very strained.

1408
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,789
What's going on?
She can't get your uncle to talk.

1409
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:16,949
He likes sports.

1410
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:20,629
I'm sorry to bust things up, but how much
longer do you think you're going to be?

1411
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,910
Could you maybe turn on a game?
I'm sorry.

1412
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,355
Shut up
Mommy, please.

1413
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,237
You were
a tremendous help.

1414
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,416
I didn't ask to sit down there.
You can't make small talk?

1415
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,816
Like every other
grown up in the world?

1416
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,960
You can't talk about boring
bullshit for half an hour?

1417
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,496
No. Hey, how about
those interest rates?

1418
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:37,876
I lost my Triple A card. Like
everybody else? No, sorry.

1419
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:44,190
You're a fucking asshole.

1420
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:05,397
Where did you say she lives? 'Cause
there are no houses there. None.

1421
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:07,280
What, does she live
in a fucking sleeping bag?

1422
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,435
119 Pigeon Hill Street.

1423
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,994
Pigeon Hill Street or Pigeon Hill Road?
Pigeon Hill Street.

1424
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:14,470
Pigeon Hill Street,
Pigeon Hill Court, Pigeon Hill Road.

1425
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,118
Street.
Pigeon Hill Street.

1426
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:17,719
This is Pigeon Hill Road.
Okay.

1427
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,536
You have no GPS whatsoever? No, I've
got a little fucking cartoon movie.

1428
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,120
You want me to punch it in for you?
No, I don't, I've got.

1429
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:25,792
Thank you.

1430
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:29,997
Okay, listen.

1431
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:31,712
Are you nervous?
Yeah, I'm nervous.

1432
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,469
What, are you a fucking genius?
Okay, skip it.

1433
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:39,674
I just want you to text me
if anything gets weird.

1434
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,550
Okay.
Thank you.

1435
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,678
Oh, my gosh.

1436
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:02,432
Is that my Patrick?

1437
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,834
Hi, Mom.

1438
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,875
Oh.
I'm so happy.

1439
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,672
Come in.

1440
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,557
Welcome to my home.

1441
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:18,189
Patrick, this is my fella.

1442
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,191
Jeffrey, this is Patrick.

1443
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:21,679
Great to finally
meet you, Patrick.

1444
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,193
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

1445
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:27,194
And this is Lee.
Hey.

1446
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:28,508
Welcome.

1447
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:31,512
Jeffrey.
Lee.

1448
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,199
Now, Lee, you sure
you can't stay for lunch?

1449
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,555
Uh, I'm positive.

1450
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,154
Thanks.

1451
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:50,513
Come.

1452
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,550
Uh, are you sure
I can't help with...

1453
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,392
No, thanks, honey.

1454
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,516
Your job is to relax.

1455
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:05,194
That is your number one
assignment, okay?

1456
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:08,636
Okay, all right. I'm really
going to apply myself.

1457
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,551
Oh, I was just joking.

1458
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,039
I know you were.
So was l.

1459
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,356
How we getting along?

1460
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,078
Great.
Great.

1461
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,877
You don't have to be
so polite, you know.

1462
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:27,757
I'm not being polite.

1463
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,594
Did you want to wash
your hands before we eat?

1464
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,159
Yes.

1465
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,593
For what we are about
to receive, let us give thanks.

1466
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,511
Amen.
Amen.

1467
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:51,470
You can say amen, Patrick.
Nobody's trying to recruit you.

1468
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,319
I did say amen.
Oh, you did? Okay.

1469
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:57,955
You don't have to. Yeah, I know.
I just said it really quietly.

1470
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,031
Oh, it's fine.

1471
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:02,918
Honey, look, I know I'm
going to be a shock to you

1472
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,638
in a lot of ways.

1473
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,199
I'm hoping
it's a good shock.

1474
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,032
Yeah.

1475
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:09,553
You need
anything else, Patrick?

1476
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:10,914
I hope everything's okay.

1477
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,797
Oh, yeah,
everything's great.

1478
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,757
You don't have
to be so formal.

1479
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:16,193
I'm not.

1480
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,197
I think your mother
wants you to feel that...

1481
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:22,950
I'm just saying that
this is your home, too.

1482
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,519
I want it to be.

1483
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,194
And... I know,

1484
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,875
I know, uh, things
are different for you and...

1485
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:34,594
I don't know.
That's okay.

1486
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,277
What are you studying
in school, Patrick?

1487
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:45,750
Oh, well,
the usual stuff.

1488
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,830
You know what?
I'm going to be right back

1489
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,876
Does anybody need anything
from the kitchen?

1490
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,116
No, thanks.
I'm good, no.

1491
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,558
Did you get
some string beans?

1492
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,557
Oh, no, not yet.
Thank you.

1493
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,879
Uh, let me um...

1494
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,271
Let me just see
what she's doing in there.

1495
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,798
So, what was she like?

1496
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,870
I don't know.
She was pretty nervous.

1497
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,632
Yeah?

1498
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,552
What was that guy like?

1499
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:40,870
He was very Christian.

1500
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,991
Uh, you know,
we're Christian, too, right?

1501
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:47,798
Yes, I know that.

1502
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:50,075
You are aware
that Catholics are Christians?

1503
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:52,230
Yes, I'm aware of that.

1504
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:58,154
Well, sounds like
she's doing better anyway.

1505
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:00,708
She's not drinking.

1506
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:03,035
She's not
in the psych ward.

1507
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,919
Wow.

1508
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,393
Wow what?

1509
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,913
You'll do anything
to get rid of me.

1510
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,116
What?
You heard me.

1511
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,598
That's not true.

1512
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,110
Dear Patrick, I'm
writing to thank you for today.

1513
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:33,952
Your visit meant the world
to your mom.

1514
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:36,833
We are both deeply grateful for the
love and trust that you've shown

1515
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,951
by offering to rejoin her life.

1516
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,496
But I feel it would be
unfair to your mom

1517
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:43,318
to rush her along the long
and challenging road ahead,

1518
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:46,198
and so I'm going to ask you
to write to me in future

1519
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,714
to arrange
any further visits.

1520
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,631
I hope you won't take
this as an intrusion...

1521
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:16,479
Where's your friends tonight?

1522
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:17,675
I don't know.

1523
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,958
Why don't you call
that girl Sandy,

1524
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,991
and see if she'll come over?
No, thanks.

1525
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:26,592
Nice try, though.

1526
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:51,551
Who are you going to shoot?
You or me?

1527
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,635
Do you know what these
things are worth? No.

1528
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,400
Want to try and sell them so you
can get a motor for the boat?

1529
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,955

I'll just pull around.

01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:32,913
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.

and I thought...

1585
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,996
Just been getting Patrick
settled in.

1586
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:01,275
It seems like
he's doing pretty good.

1587
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,713
Considering.

1588
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,597
I think he is.
Yeah.

1589
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:09,108
I guess
you don't know this, but l...

1590
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:11,520
I really kept in touch
with Joe.

1591
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:14,176
I knew that. It's been kind of
weird for me not seeing Patrick...

1592
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,031
Okay.
I didn't know.

1593
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:19,392
You can see him
if you want.

1594
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:21,391
Could we ever have lunch?

1595
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,959
You mean us?
You and me?

1596
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,149
Yeah.

1597
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:28,348
Um...

1598
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:30,032
Because I, uh...

1599
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:39,436
I said a lot
of terrible things to you.

1600
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:40,520
No.

1601
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,994
But l... I know you never...

1602
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,317
Maybe you don't want
to talk to me.

1603
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:51,436
It's not that.
Let me finish.

1604
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:54,509
However...

1605
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,631
my heart was broken.

1606
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:03,675
'Cause it's always
going to be broken.

1607
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:08,434
And I know yours
is broken, too.

1608
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,557
But I don't have
to carry...

1609
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:16,078
I said things that...

1610
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,400
I should fucking burn in hell
for what I said to you.

1611
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,238
No, no, no, no.
It was just...

1612
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,555
Randi, no.
I'm just sorry.

1613
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:26,591
I-I-I can't,
I can't...

1614
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,159
Lee, I love you.

1615
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:33,315
Maybe I shouldn't say that.
You can say that.

1616
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:34,440
I just...

1617
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:38,033
I'm sorry. I've got to go.
We couldn't have lunch?

1618
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,752
I'm really sorry.
I don't think so.

1619
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:43,560
I thank you for saying everything
that you said. You can't just die.

1620
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:47,394
I'm not, I'm not,
and I'm not, and I'm...

to tell you...

1624
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:55,056
I would want to talk
to you, Randi... But Lee...

1625
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:57,753
Please, I-I-I...

1626

I don't know what...

1628
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:06,839
I don't want to torture you.
You're not torturing me.

1629
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:10,435
I just want to tell you
that I was wrong.

1630
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,391
No, no.

1631
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:16,069
You don't understand.
There's nothing there.

1632
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:18,395
There's nothing there.
That's not true.

1633
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:21,034
That's not true. There's nothing there.
You don't understand.

1634
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,576
I don't know what to say.
I can understand.

1635
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,795
I know you understand.

1636
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:27,917

1644
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,233
He's Joey Chandler's brother.
Back off, back off.

1645
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,228

Get off.
You'll fucking kill him.

1651
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:42,913
Should he go

1652
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,831
I don't think so.
Nothing's broken.

1653

hit him with, a baseball bat?

1654

01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:53,436
He's with the kids.
I sent them out for burgers.

I'll give you some money.
Put that away. I got it.

1661
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,112

Oh, no, thanks, buddy.

Yes, honey.

1674

No, honey.
You're not burning.

1676

Uncle Lee,
what is that smell?

1677
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:41,594
I just burnt the sauce.
Everything's okay.

1678
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,199
Yeah.

1679
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:35,512
I got a job in Boston.
Starts in July.

1680
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:40,392
What is it?

1681
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:43,552
Custodian.
Handy man.

1682
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:46,757
But it's just two buildings
this time, so...

1683
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:52,678
And what uh, delightful Boston neighborhood
have you selected for us to live in?

1684
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:54,959
None.

1685
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:57,435
What do you mean?
You don't have to move to Boston.

1686
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,230
I'm going to be
in Charlestown.

1687
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:03,231
And George
is going to take you.

1688
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:07,998
What?

1689
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:11,597
I talked to him
last week.

1690
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:14,513
I explained
the situation to them.

1691
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:17,910
Georgie Junior's going to BU in the
fall, and Jimmy graduates next year.

1692
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,276
We can rent this house out
until you turn 18,

1693
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:23,430
and then you can come back
and stay if you want.

1694
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:26,592
When you turn 21, you're
allowed to sell it or keep it,

1695
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:28,398
or whatever
you want to do.

1696
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:32,473
We definitely have to hire out
the boat when the summer's over.

1697
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:36,354
Just like we talked about.

1698
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:38,829
And when you get
your license, we can...

1699
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,189
We can just figure that out
when it happens.

1700
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,431
I'm still the trustee,

1701
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:47,590
and all the financial stuff
that Joe set up for me

1702
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:49,875
is going to get transferred
over to George.

1703
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:53,077
Basically everything is staying the same,
except you don't have to move.

1704
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:01,712
And, but who's... Are they going
to be my guardians, or...

1705
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:03,358
They're going to adopt you.

1706
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:12,557
Anyway, that's just how
I set it up.

1707
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:16,116
You don't have to.
It's up to you.

1708
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:21,836
So you're just going to disappear?
No.

1709
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,275
No.

1710
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:26,794
I set it up this way
so you could stay here.

1711
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:29,800
And they're really glad
to have you.

1712
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:32,269
I know, I know.
I mean, they're great, but...

1713
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:38,834
Why can't you stay?

1714
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:40,512
Come on, Patty.

1715
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:52,750
I can't beat it.

1716
02:06:58,240 --> 02:07:00,117
I can't beat it.

1717
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:02,599
I'm sorry.

1718
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:02,919
What do you think?

1719
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,070
I think it'll be okay.

1720
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:07,390
Are you one
of Stan Chandler's boys?

1721
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:08,879
Yeah, I'm Lee.

1722
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:11,918
I used to play chess with
your father a long time ago.

1723
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,070
He was a excellent
chess player.

1724
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:15,354
That's him.

1725
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,192
He's not still living, is he?

1726
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:18,759
No.

1727
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:21,752
One of the sons passed away recently,
I heard.

1728
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:23,711
Uh, yeah, my brother Joe.

1729
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:26,195
Very personable man.

1730
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:31,639
My father
passed away in 1959.

1731
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:35,952
A young man.
He worked on a tuna boat.

1732
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,190
He get up one morning,

1733
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:41,556
some weather,
nothing dramatic,

1734
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,630
and he never returned.

1735
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:47,678
No signals, no maydays.

1736
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:50,991
No one ever found out
what happened to him.

1737
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:13,432
I'm going to get
some ice cream.

1738
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:15,829
Go ahead.

1739
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:17,319
Can I have some money?

1740
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:21,113
Yes.

1741
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:53,280
So, when am I supposed
to move in with Georgie?

1742
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,509
July.

1743
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,552
I don't even have
a place to live, yet.

1744
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:00,631
They don't give you
an apartment?

1745
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:03,188
Yeah, but I'm looking for one
with an extra room.

1746
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:06,509
Or room
for a pull-out sofa.

1747
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:08,352
What for?

1748
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:18,510
So you can come
visit sometime.

1749
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:24,672
Or if you're going to look at colleges
in Boston, you can stay overnight.

1750
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:26,432
I'm not going to college.

1751
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,949
Well, I'll have an extra room
for all my shit.

1752
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,714
Do we have to talk
about this now?

1753
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:37,119
No.

1754
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:50,159
Great throw.

1755
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:56,159
Just let it go.

1756
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:00,559
Heads up.
