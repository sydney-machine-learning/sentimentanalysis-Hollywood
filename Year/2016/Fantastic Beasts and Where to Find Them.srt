3
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,626
Dougal... you settle down now, please.

4
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,604
It won’t be long.

5
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,558
Next.

6
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:43,096
British, huh? -Yes.
-First trip to New York? -Yes.

7
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,719
Anything edible in there?
-No.

8
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,201
Livestock?

9
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,587
Must get that fixed... ahh, no.

10
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,721
Let me take a look.

11
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,683
Welcome to New York.
-Thank you.

12
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,640
Next!

13
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,690
And it was like a... like a
wind or like a... like a ghost...

14
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:41,237
but dark... and I saw its eyes.

15
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:43,810
Shinin’ white eyes...

16
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:52,548
A dark wind... with eyes.
-Like a dark mass,

17
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:55,819
and it dove down there, down underground.

18
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:58,850
Someone ought do something about it.

19
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:02,982
It's everywhere this thing.
It's out of control.

20
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:08,773
Hey, did you get anything?
-Dark wind, blah blah.

21
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:12,997
It’s some atmospheric hooey.
Or electrical.

22
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,933
Hey, you thirsty? -Nah, I’m on the
wagon. Promised Martha I’d lay off.

23
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,820
It's atmospheric.

24
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:07,865
This great city sparkles with
the jewels of man’s invention!

25
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,349
Movie theaters, automobiles,
the wireless, electric lights.

26
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:15,901
All dazzle and bewitch us!
-So sorry.

27
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:20,668
But where there is light
there is shadow, friend.

28
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:27,065
Something is stalking our city, wreaking
destruction and then disappearing without a trace.

29
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:32,622
Listen to me.
We have to fight, join us,

30
00:05:32,657 --> 00:05:36,933
the Second Salemers, in our fight!
-Excuse me, doll. -You hear me?

31
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:39,521
Just trying to get to the bank.
-We have to fight together...

32
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:44,032
Excuse me, trying... -Watch it!
-So sorry, my case.

33
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,144
No harm done.

34
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:51,702
Excuse me!
-You, friend!

35
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,597
What drew you to our meeting today?

36
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:01,093
Oh... I was just passing.
-Are you a seeker?

37
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,709
A seeker after truth?

38
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:06,951
I’m more of a chaser, really.

39
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:12,828
Hear my words and heed my warning.

40
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:16,283
And laugh if you dare.

41
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,155
Witches live among us!

42
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:25,381
We have to fight together for the sake
of our children, for the sake of tomorrow!

43
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:29,050
What do you say to that, friend?

44
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,640
Excuse me.

45
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:01,667
Can I help you, sir?

46
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,399
No, I was just... just... waiting.

47
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:20,181
Hi.

48
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:23,921
What brings you here?
-Same as you...

49
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:27,825
You’re here to get a loan
to open up a bakery? -Yes.

50
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,746
What are the odds of that?

51
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:36,681
Well, may the best man win, I guess.
-Excuse me.

52
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,482
Hey, mister... Hey, mister!

53
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:48,374
Hey, fella! -Mr. Kowalski,
Mr. Bingley will see you now.

54
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,749
Okay... Okay.

55
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:21,862
You are currently working
in a canning factory?

56
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:26,602
That’s the best I can
do... I only got back in ’24.

57
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:28,986
Got back?
-From Europe, sir.

58
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:32,559
Yeah... I was part of the
Expeditionary Forces there.

59
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,845
All right. -Mr. Kowalski. -You
gotta try the paczki. Okay?

60
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,548
It’s my grandmother’s
recipe, the orange zest... just...

61
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:18,720
Mr. Kowalski, what do you propose
to offer the bank as collateral?

62
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,527
Collateral?
-Collateral.

63
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:29,460
There are machines now that can
produce hundreds of doughnuts an hour...

64
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:32,228
I know, I know, but they’re
nothing like what I can do.

65
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:35,570
The bank must be
protected, Mr. Kowalski.

66
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:37,926
Good day to you.

67
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,490
Hey, Mr. English guy!
I think your egg is hatching.

68
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,282
What? What just happened?

69
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,244
But...

70
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:33,704
Excuse me...

71
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:43,371
I was... over there. I was... over there?

72
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:48,346
In you hop...
-Hello?

73
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:53,264
No. Everyone settle down. Stay.

74
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:57,836
Dougal, don’t make me come in there.
Don’t make me come down there.

75
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:05,348
Absolutely not!
Alohomora!

76
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,577
Oh, so you’re gonna steal the money, huh?

77
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:13,489
Petrificus Totalus!

78
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,116
Mr. Bingley!

79
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,617
Kowalski!

80
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,453
Really?

81
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:47,359
No... Look at that.
Look.

82
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:56,713
Oh no... No, no, no.
Don’t shoot. Don’t shoot!

83
00:11:57,443 --> 00:12:02,106
What? For the last time, you pilfering
pest... paws off what doesn’t belong to you.

84
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:06,427
I’m awfully sorry about all that.

85
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:11,306
What the hell was that?
-Nothing that need concern you.

86
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:16,042
Now unfortunately you have seen far
too much, so if you wouldn’t mind...

87
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:20,614
if you just stand there, this
will be over in a jiffy. -Sure, yeah.

88
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:24,327
Sorry...

89
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,832
Bugger.

90
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:48,478
Who are you?
-I’m sorry?

91
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,659
Who are you? -Newt Scamander. And you
are? -What’s that thing in your case?

92
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:56,318
That’s my Niffler.

93
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,241
You’ve got something on your... -Why in the name
of Deliverance Dane did you let that thing loose?

94
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:05,240
I didn’t mean to, he’s incorrigible, you
see, anything shiny, he’s all over the place.

95
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:08,865
You didn’t mean to? -No. -You could not have
chosen a worse time to let that creature loose!

96
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:11,772
We’re in the middle of a situation here!

97
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:16,475
I’m taking you in.
-You’re taking me where?

98
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:19,777
Magical Congress of the
United States of America.

99
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:24,552
So, you work for MACUSA?

100
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,705
What are you, some kind of investigator?

101
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,601
Can you please tell me you
took care of the No-Maj?

102
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:37,733
The what? -The No-Maj!
No-magic... the non-wizard!

103
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:42,780
Oh, sorry, we call them Muggles.
-You wiped his memory, right?

104
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:44,559
The No-Maj with the case?

105
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:52,107
That’s a Section 3A, Mr.
Scamander. I’m taking you in.

106
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,330
Come on.

107
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:09,311
Er... sorry, but I do have things to do,
actually. -Well, you’ll have to rearrange them!

108
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:14,327
What are you doing in New York anyway?
-I came to buy a birthday present.

109
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,522
Couldn’t you have done that in London?

110
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:19,000
No, there’s only one breeder
of Appaloosa Puffskeins

111
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,245
in the world and he lives in New York, so no.

112
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:24,827
I got a Section 3A.

113
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:31,309
By the way, we don’t allow the breeding
of magical creatures in New York.

114
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:33,949
We closed that guy down a year ago.

115
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,466
Hey, Goldstein.
-Hey, Red.

116
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:31,927
Major Investigation Department.
-I thought you was...

117
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:34,847
Major Investigation Department!
I got a Section 3A!

118
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:45,614
The International Confederation
is threatening to send a delegation.

119
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:49,763
They think this is related to
Grindelwald’s attacks in Europe.

120
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:54,517
I was there. This is a beast.

121
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:58,420
No human could do what this thing
is capable of, Madam President.

122
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:02,125
Whatever it is, one thing’s
clear, it must be stopped.

123
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,574
It’s terrorizing No-Majs and when
No-Majs are afraid, they attack.

124
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,726
This could mean exposure.
It could mean war.

125
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:21,232
I made your position here
quite clear, Miss Goldstein.

126
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:24,304
Yes, Madam President, but I...
-You are no longer an Auror.

127
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:32,025
No, Madam President, but...
-Goldstein.

128
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:37,017
There’s been a minor incident... -Well, this office
is currently concerned with very major incidents.

129
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,752
Get out.
-Yes, ma’am.

130
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:09,084
So, you got your wand permit? All
foreigners have to have them in New York.

131
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,954
I made a postal application weeks ago.

132
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:20,453
Scamander... And you were
just in Equatorial Guinea?

133
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:23,001
I’ve just completed a year in the field.

134
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:27,127
I’m writing a book about magical creatures.
-Like... an extermination guide?

135
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,579
No. A guide to help people understand why
we should be protecting these creatures

136
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:34,336
instead of killing them.
-Goldstein! Where is she?

137
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:37,288
Where is she? Goldstein!

138
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:40,354
Goldstein!

139
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,889
Did you just butt in on the
Investigative Team again?

140
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,157
Where’ve you been?
-What?

141
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:55,401
Where’d she pick you up?
-Me?

142
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,154
Have you been tracking them Second
Salemers again? -Of course not, sir.

143
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:07,683
Afternoon, Mr. Graves, sir!
-Afternoon, Abernathy.

144
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:12,933
Mr. Graves, sir, this is Mr. Scamander.
He has a crazy creature in that case

145
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:16,519
and it got out and caused
mayhem in a bank, sir.

146
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:18,808
Let’s see the little guy.

147
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,450
But, sir...

148
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:48,273
Tina...

149
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:10,031
I’m sorry, Grandma.

150
00:19:56,914 --> 00:20:00,786
My momma, your momma,
gonna catch a witch.

151
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:04,453
My momma, your momma,
flying on a switch.

152
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:08,806
My momma, your momma,
witches never cry.

153
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:12,778
My momma, your momma,
witches gonna die!

154
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,459
Witch number one, drown in
a river!

155
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,129
Witch number two,
gotta noose to give her!

156
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:40,072
Witch number three,
gonna watch her burn.

157
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:44,360
Witch number four, flogging
take a turn.

158
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:52,990
Collect your leaflets before
you get food, children.

159
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,701
Is it a witch’s mark, ma’am?

160
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:18,163
No. He’s okay.

161
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,516
I can’t believe you
didn’t obliviate that man!

162
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,097
If there’s an inquiry, I’m finished! -So why
would you be finished? I’m the one that’s...

163
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:39,621
I’m not supposed to go
near the Second Salemers!

164
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:47,614
What was that?

165
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,703
Er... moth, I think. Big moth.

166
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,697
Hey, quiet down. I’m trying to get a statement.
-I’m telling you it’s a gas explosion again.

167
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:03,389
I ain’t taking the kids back
up there until it’s safe. -Sorry, ma’am.

168
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:06,748
There ain’t no smell of gas.
-It wasn’t gas, Officer, I seen it!

169
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:12,549
It wuzza... a gigantic...
a huge hippopotto gas. Gas.

170
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:36,665
I don't know.

171
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:41,988
Mr. Scamander.

172
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:05,058
It was open?

173
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:08,680
Just a smidge... -That crazy
Niffler thing’s on the loose again?

174
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:14,021
It might be.
-Then look for it! Look!

175
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:18,929
His neck’s bleeding, he’s hurt!

176
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:21,197
Wake up, Mr. No-Maj.

177
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:31,042
Mercy Lewis, what is that?
-Nothing to worry about. That is a Murtlap.

178
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,880
What else have you got in there?

179
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:38,292
You!
-Hello.

180
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:42,193
Easy, Mr...
-Kowalski... Jacob.

181
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:45,132
You can’t obliviate him!
We need him as a witness.

182
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:48,710
I’m sorry, you’ve just yelled at me the length
of New York for not doing it in the first place.

183
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:52,595
He’s hurt! He looks ill!
-He’ll be fine. Murtlap bites aren’t serious.

184
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:00,736
I admit that is a slightly more
severe reaction than I’ve seen,

185
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:03,650
but if it was really serious,
he’d have...

186
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:06,382
What?

187
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:09,084
Well, the first symptom
would be flames out of

188
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:11,028
his anus...
-This is balled up!

189
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:13,882
It’ll last forty-eight hours at most!
I can keep him if you want me to.

190
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,449
Oh, keep him? We don’t
keep them! Mr. Scamander,

191
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,775
do you know anything about the wizarding community
in America? -I do know a few things, actually.

192
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:25,590
I know you have rather backwards laws
about relations with non-magic people.

193
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,262
That you’re not meant to befriend
them, that you can’t marry them,

194
00:24:29,297 --> 00:24:31,775
which seems mildly absurd to me.
-Who’s going to marry him?

195
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,494
You’re both coming with me.
-I don’t see why I need to come with you.

196
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:38,263
Help me!
-I’m dreaming, right?

197
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:41,891
Please. -Yeah, I’m tired,
I never went to the bank.

198
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,901
This is all just some big nightmare, right?
-For the both of us, Mr. Kowalski.

199
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:48,752
And so this is the newsroom.
Let's go.

200
00:25:49,252 --> 00:25:53,803
Hey, how are you? Make
way for the Barebones!

201
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:58,622
Now, they’re just putting the
papers to bed, as they say.

202
00:26:03,281 --> 00:26:05,894
Mr. Shaw, sir, he’s with the senator.

203
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:08,454
Never mind that, Barker,
I wanna see my father!

204
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:14,775
I’m so sorry, Mr. Shaw, but your son insisted.
-Father, you’re going to want to hear this.

205
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:19,955
I’ve got something huge!

206
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,883
Your brother and I are busy here,
Langdon. Working on his election campaign.

207
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:25,704
We don’t have time for this.

208
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:29,937
This is Mary Lou Barebone from
the New Salem Preservation Society,

209
00:26:29,972 --> 00:26:34,199
and she’s got a big story for you!
-Oh, she has, has she?

210
00:26:34,936 --> 00:26:36,844
There’s strange things
going on all over the city.

211
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,921
The people behind this,
they are not like you and me.

212
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:44,543
This is witchcraft, don’t you see.
-Langdon. -She doesn’t want any money.

213
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,441
Then either her story is worthless,
or she’s lying about the cost.

214
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:52,422
Nobody gives away anything valuable
for free, Langdon. -You are right, Mr. Shaw.

215
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:57,339
What we desire is infinitely more
valuable than money: It’s your influence.

216
00:26:57,457 --> 00:27:02,213
Millions of people read your newspapers and
they need to be made aware about this danger.

217
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:06,569
The crazy disturbances in the
subway, just look at the pictures!

218
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,792
I’d like you and your friends to leave.
-No, you’re missing a trick here.

219
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:14,499
Just look at the evidence.
-Really. -Langdon.

220
00:27:14,547 --> 00:27:16,795
Just listen to Father and go. And...

221
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:22,435
Take the freaks with you.
-This is Father’s office, not yours. -Okay.

222
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,149
And I’m sick of this every time I
walk in here... -That's it. Thank you.

223
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:33,147
We hope you’ll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.

224
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,462
We’re not difficult to find.

225
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:40,831
Until then, we thank you for your time.

226
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:54,134
Hey, boy.

227
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,983
You dropped something.

228
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:05,116
Here you go, freak. Why don’t you put
that in the trash where you all belong.

229
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:17,395
Take a right here.

230
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:31,352
Okay, before we go in... I’m not
supposed to have men on the premises.

231
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,540
In that case, Mr. Kowalski and I can easily
seek other accommodation. -Oh no, you don’t!

232
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,050
Watch your step.

233
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,603
That you, Tina?

234
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:49,995
Yes, Mrs. Esposito!
-Are you alone?

235
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:53,043
I’m always alone, Mrs. Esposito!

236
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:10,414
Teenie, you brought men home?

237
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:15,673
Gentlemen, this is my sister.

238
00:29:16,682 --> 00:29:19,640
You want to put something on, Queenie?
-Sure.

239
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:39,653
So, who are they?
-That’s Mr. Scamander.

240
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:43,337
He’s committed a serious infraction
of the National Statute of Secrecy.

241
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:45,852
He’s a criminal?
-Uh-huh.

242
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:50,952
And this is Mr. Kowalski, he’s a No-Maj.
-A No-Maj?

243
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:54,971
Teen, what are you up to?
-He’s sick, it’s a long story.

244
00:29:56,182 --> 00:30:00,012
Mr. Scamander has lost something,
I’m going to help him find it.

245
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:05,071
You need to sit down, honey.
Hey, he hasn’t eaten all day.

246
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:10,140
That’s rough, he didn’t get
the money he wanted for his bakery.

247
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,875
You bake, honey?

248
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:16,212
I love to cook.
-You’re a Legilimens?

249
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:21,922
Uh-huh, yeah. But I always have trouble
with your kind. Brits. It’s the accent.

250
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:25,566
You know how to read minds?
-Don’t worry, honey.

251
00:30:26,232 --> 00:30:29,898
Most guys think what you was
thinking, first time they see me.

252
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:33,880
Now, you need food.

253
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:51,588
Hot dog... again? -Don’t read my
mind! -Not a very wholesome lunch.

254
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,622
Hey, Mr. Scamander,

255
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:11,648
you prefer pie or strudel?

256
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:16,698
I really don’t have a preference.

257
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,717
You prefer strudel, huh, honey?

258
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:27,487
Strudel it is.

259
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,681
Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.

260
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,261
We’re not going to poison you.

261
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:34,365
You’re upset. It’s your mother again.

262
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,548
Somebody’s said something,
what did they say? Tell me.

263
00:32:39,236 --> 00:32:43,854
Do you think I’m a freak? -No, I
think you’re a very special young man

264
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:46,827
or I wouldn’t have asked
you to help me, now would I?

265
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,114
Have you any news?
-I’m still looking.

266
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,627
Mr. Graves, if I knew
whether it was a girl or boy...

267
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:05,744
My vision showed only
the child’s immense power.

268
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:08,604
He or she is no older than ten,

269
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:12,533
and I saw this child in close
proximity to your mother.

270
00:33:12,568 --> 00:33:14,912
She I saw so plainly.

271
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:18,538
That could be any one of hundreds.
-There is something else.

272
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:21,928
Something I haven’t told you.
I saw you beside me in New York.

273
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,719
You’re the one that gains this child’s trust.

274
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,496
You are the key, I saw this.

275
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:32,785
You want to join the wizarding world.

276
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:37,902
I want those things too,
Credence. I want them for you.

277
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:43,812
So find the child. Find the
child and we’ll all be free.

278
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,109
The job ain’t that glamorous. I
mean, I spend most days making coffee,

279
00:33:50,355 --> 00:33:53,834
unjinxing the john.
Tina’s the career girl.

280
00:33:56,148 --> 00:34:01,060
Nah. We’re orphans. Ma and Pa died
of dragon pox when we were kids.

281
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:07,322
You’re sweet. But we got each other!

282
00:34:09,374 --> 00:34:11,907
Could you stop reading
my mind for a second?

283
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:16,050
Don’t get me wrong,
I love it.

284
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:22,531
This meal, it’s insanely good!
This is what I do, I’m a cook.

285
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:26,933
And this is, like, the greatest
meal I have ever had in my life.

286
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:34,576
Oh, you slay me! I ain’t never really
talked to a No-Maj before.

287
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:38,019
Really?

288
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,053
I am not flirting!

289
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:55,141
I’m just saying, don’t go getting attached,
he’s going to have to be obliviated!

290
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:58,481
It’s nothing personal.

291
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:04,303
Hey, you okay, honey? -Miss Goldstein, I think
Mr. Kowalski could do with an early night.

292
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:08,071
And besides, you and I will need to be up
early tomorrow morning to find my Niffler, so...

293
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:12,577
What’s a Niffler?
-Don’t ask.

294
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:15,697
Okay, you guys can bunk in here.

295
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:35,293
I thought you might like a hot drink?

296
00:35:48,118 --> 00:35:50,758
Hey, Mr. Scamander...
Look, cocoa!

297
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:57,974
The toilet’s down the hall to the right.
-Thanks...

298
00:36:01,114 --> 00:36:02,814
Very much.

299
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:27,476
Come on.

300
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:44,794
For the love of...

301
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:02,114
Will you sit down?
-Good idea.

302
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,516
That’s definitely the Murtlap. You
must be particularly susceptible.

303
00:37:12,118 --> 00:37:16,153
See, you’re a Muggle. So our
physiologies are subtly different.

304
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:28,659
Stay still. Now that
should stop the sweating.

305
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,802
And one of those should sort the twitch.

306
00:37:37,784 --> 00:37:39,484
Take that.

307
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:47,076
Come on...

308
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:52,137
What you got there? -This
the locals call “Swooping Evil”,

309
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,478
not the friendliest of names.
It’s quite an agile fellow.

310
00:38:01,702 --> 00:38:03,735
I’ve been studying him. And
I am pretty sure his venom

311
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,896
could be quite useful if properly diluted.

312
00:38:06,672 --> 00:38:09,242
Just to remove bad memories, you know.

313
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,814
Probably shouldn’t let
him loose in here, though.

314
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,690
Come on.

315
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,227
Come on. Down you come.

316
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,457
Come on.

317
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:56,735
Oh, thank Paracelsus.

318
00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:01,061
If you’d have got out that could
have been quite catastrophic.

319
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:04,023
You see, he’s the real
reason I came to America.

320
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:10,164
To bring Frank home.

321
00:39:12,177 --> 00:39:15,624
No, sorry, stay there, he’s a
wee bit sensitive to strangers.

322
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:21,005
Here you are, here you are.
He was trafficked, you see.

323
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:24,405
I found him in Egypt, he was all chained up.

324
00:39:25,272 --> 00:39:28,183
Couldn’t leave him there,
had to bring him back.

325
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:30,634
I’m going to put you back where
you belong, aren’t I, Frank?

326
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:34,920
To the wilds of Arizona.

327
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:18,000
Here they come. -Here
who comes? -The Graphorns.

328
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:23,150
You’re all right. You’re all right.

329
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:27,265
Hello, hello!

330
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:32,257
So they’re the last
breeding pair in existence.

331
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:37,487
If I hadn’t managed to rescue them, that
could have been the end of Graphorns, forever.

332
00:40:43,536 --> 00:40:45,236
All right.

333
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:51,997
What, you rescue these creatures?
-Yes, that’s right.

334
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,433
Rescue, nurture, and protect them,

335
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:57,936
and I’m gently trying to educate
my fellow wizards about them.

336
00:40:57,973 --> 00:40:59,673
Come on.

337
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,451
Titus? Finn? Poppy, Marlow, Tom?

338
00:41:16,805 --> 00:41:19,680
He had a cold. He needed some body warmth.

339
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,431
Right, on you hop.

340
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:31,666
See, he has some attachment issues.
-Now, come on, Pickett.

341
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:37,004
Pickett. No, they’re not going
to bully you. Now, come on.

342
00:41:38,585 --> 00:41:40,285
Pickett!

343
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:44,982
All right. But that is exactly
why they accuse me of favoritism.

344
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,613
I wonder where Dougal’s gone.

345
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:54,309
All right, I’m coming, I’m
coming, Mum’s here. Mum’s here.

346
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:59,063
Hello, you, let me take a look at you.
-I know these guys.

347
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:05,960
Your Occamy.
-What do you mean? My Occamy?

348
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:08,706
Yes, do you want to...

349
00:42:10,383 --> 00:42:12,334
Yeah, sure. Okay.

350
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:24,154
Hey.
-No, sorry, don’t pet them.

351
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:29,286
They learn to defend themselves early. See, their
shells are made of silver so they’re incredibly valuable.

352
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:32,840
Okay. -Their nests tend to
get ransacked by hunters.

353
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,575
Thank you.

354
00:42:36,102 --> 00:42:38,632
Mr. Scamander?
-Call me Newt.

355
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:41,726
Newt, I don’t think I’m dreaming.

356
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:45,969
What gave it away?
-I ain’t got the brains to make this up.

357
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:52,694
Actually, would you mind throwing some of
those pellets in with the Mooncalves over there?

358
00:42:54,712 --> 00:42:56,412
Yeah, sure.
-Just over there...

359
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:04,702
Bugger, Niffler’s gone. Of
course he has, little bugger.

360
00:43:04,737 --> 00:43:07,804
Any chance to get his
hands on something shiny.

361
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:47,071
What did you do today, Jacob?

362
00:43:47,577 --> 00:43:53,371
I was inside a suitcase.
Hey. Hello, fellas. All right, all right.

363
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:56,967
Take it easy, take it easy.

364
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,134
Cutie. There it is.

365
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,136
Step back.
-Jeez...

366
00:44:56,683 --> 00:45:02,178
Step back. -What’s the matter
with this? -I said step away. -Yeah.

367
00:45:03,155 --> 00:45:07,618
What the hell is this thing?
-It’s an Obscurus.

368
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,873
I need to get going, find everyone
who’s escaped before they get hurt.

369
00:45:12,908 --> 00:45:17,551
Before they could get hurt? -Yes, Mr. Kowalski.
They’re currently in alien terrain,

370
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:20,287
surrounded by millions of the most
vicious creatures on the planet.

371
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,200
Humans.

372
00:45:25,758 --> 00:45:31,018
So where would you say that a medium-sized
creature that likes broad, open plains,

373
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:34,388
trees, water holes, that kind
of thing, where might she go?

374
00:45:34,423 --> 00:45:38,178
In New York City?
-Yes. -Plains?

375
00:45:39,057 --> 00:45:43,049
Central Park? -And where is that
exactly? -Where is Central Park?

376
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:50,768
Well, look, I would come and show you,

377
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:53,214
but don’t you think it’s
kind of a double cross?

378
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:55,837
The girls take us in,
they make us hot cocoa.

379
00:45:55,872 --> 00:45:59,600
You do realize that when they see you’ve stopped
sweating, they’ll obliviate you in a heartbeat.

380
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:03,445
What does “Bliviate” mean? -It’ll be like
you wake up and all memory of magic is gone.

381
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,822
I won’t remember any of this?
-No.

382
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:18,322
All right, yeah, okay, I’ll help you.

383
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:24,393
Come on, then.

384
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:43,689
Credence, where have you been?

385
00:46:47,024 --> 00:46:49,182
I was looking for a place
for tomorrow’s meeting.

386
00:46:52,873 --> 00:46:55,626
There’s a corner on
Thirty-Second Street that could...

387
00:47:03,257 --> 00:47:06,260
I’m sorry, Ma. I didn’t realize it was so late.

388
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:05,530
I was watching you at dinner. -Yeah.
-People like you, don’t they, Mr. Kowalski?

389
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,796
Well, I’m sure people like you too, huh?
-No, not really. I annoy people.

390
00:48:15,855 --> 00:48:17,717
Why did you decide to be a baker?

391
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:22,588
Well, because I’m dying
in that canning factory.

392
00:48:22,623 --> 00:48:28,416
Everyone there’s dying. It just crushes the
life outta you. You like canned food? -No.

393
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:34,209
Yeah. Me neither. That’s why I want to make pastries, you
know. It makes people happy. We’re going this way.

394
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:36,532
So did you get your loan?

395
00:48:37,752 --> 00:48:42,856
No, I ain’t got no collateral. Stayed in
the army too long, apparently, I don’t know.

396
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:47,539
You fought in the war? -Of course I fought in the war,
everyone fought in the war. You didn’t fight in the war?

397
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:50,959
I worked mostly with dragons,
Ukrainian Ironbellies,

398
00:48:51,206 --> 00:48:53,033
Eastern Front.

399
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:23,551
Finestra.

400
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:27,418
Accio!

401
00:50:46,689 --> 00:50:48,389
All right? Happy?

402
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,620
One down, two to go.

403
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:07,543
They went that way, Officer.
-Hands up!

404
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,220
What the hell is that?

405
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,360
Lion...

406
00:51:26,121 --> 00:51:30,500
You know, New York is considerably
more interesting than I’d expected.

407
00:51:47,364 --> 00:51:51,690
Put this on. -Why would I have
to wear something like this?

408
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,845
Because your skull is susceptible
to breakage under immense force.

409
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,338
But we made ’em cocoa.

410
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,520
Right.

411
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:29,949
Okay, if you just, pop this on.
-Okay.

412
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:32,952
Now, there’s absolutely
nothing for you to worry about.

413
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,174
Tell me, has anyone ever believed
you when you told them not to worry?

414
00:52:37,209 --> 00:52:40,788
My philosophy is that worrying
means you suffer twice.

415
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:48,692
She’s in season. She needs to mate.

416
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:56,831
Erumpent musk,
she is mad for it.

417
00:54:05,512 --> 00:54:07,212
Good girl...

418
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,770
Come on, into the case.

419
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,120
Oh, no.

420
00:54:58,066 --> 00:54:59,766
Repar...

421
00:55:02,185 --> 00:55:04,667
Merlin’s beard!

422
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,090
They’re exactly the same.

423
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:15,573
Same thing.
-Newt!

424
00:55:20,047 --> 00:55:21,747
No, no, no, don’t!

425
00:55:23,169 --> 00:55:24,869
I’m so sorry.

426
00:56:22,474 --> 00:56:24,174
Good show, Mr. Kowalski!

427
00:56:27,197 --> 00:56:28,897
Call me Jacob.

428
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,387
Two down, one to go.

429
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:46,885
In you hop.

430
00:57:02,705 --> 00:57:06,973
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight’s keynote speaker

431
00:57:08,093 --> 00:57:10,482
needs no introduction from me.

432
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,730
He’s been mentioned
as a future president.

433
00:57:14,736 --> 00:57:18,386
And if you don’t believe me,
just read his daddy’s newspapers.

434
00:57:22,074 --> 00:57:27,712
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the senator for New York, Henry Shaw!

435
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:37,348
Thank you. Thank you!

436
00:57:41,272 --> 00:57:42,972
Thank you.

437
00:58:07,337 --> 00:58:14,054
And it’s true we have made some progress,
but there is no reward for idleness.

438
00:58:14,927 --> 00:58:19,238
So just as the odious
saloons have been banished...

439
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:27,390
What's going on?

440
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:38,679
So now the pool halls, and
these private parlors...

441
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:53,304
What is that?

442
00:59:43,216 --> 00:59:47,522
Witches!

443
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:57,252
Our American friends have permitted
a breach of the Statute of Secrecy,

444
00:59:57,287 --> 01:00:00,516
that threatens to expose us all.

445
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:04,729
I will not be lectured by the man who let
Gellert Grindelwald slip through his fingers.

446
01:00:04,764 --> 01:00:07,963
Madam President, I’m so sorry to
interrupt, but this is critical.

447
01:00:22,237 --> 01:00:25,887
You’d better have an excellent excuse
for this intrusion, Miss Goldstein.

448
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:28,409
Yes, I do.

449
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:36,305
Ma’am. Yesterday a wizard
entered New York with a case.

450
01:00:37,029 --> 01:00:41,254
This case full of magical creatures,
and unfortunately, some have escaped.

451
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:43,592
He arrived yesterday?

452
01:00:44,736 --> 01:00:48,820
You have known for twenty-four
hours that an unregistered wizard

453
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:51,400
set magical beasts loose in New York

454
01:00:51,435 --> 01:00:54,497
and you see fit to tell us
only when a man has been killed?

455
01:00:56,458 --> 01:01:00,514
Who has been killed?
-Where is this man?

456
01:01:40,672 --> 01:01:42,372
Scamander?

457
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:47,972
Hello, Minister.
-Theseus Scamander? The war hero?

458
01:01:48,498 --> 01:01:52,603
No, this is his little brother.
And what are you doing in New York?

459
01:01:52,867 --> 01:01:55,885
I came to buy an Appaloosa
Puffskein, sir. -Right.

460
01:01:56,431 --> 01:01:58,131
What are you really doing here?

461
01:01:59,399 --> 01:02:01,850
Goldstein, and who is this?

462
01:02:02,696 --> 01:02:04,413
This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam President,

463
01:02:04,414 --> 01:02:07,234
he’s a No-Maj who got bitten by
one of Mr. Scamander’s creatures.

464
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,186
No-Maj?
-Obliviated?

465
01:02:14,466 --> 01:02:16,226
Merlin’s beard.

466
01:02:16,227 --> 01:02:20,217
You know which of your creatures
was responsible, Mr. Scamander?

467
01:02:25,477 --> 01:02:30,140
No creature did this.  Don’t pretend!

468
01:02:30,571 --> 01:02:33,105
You must know what that
was, look at the marks...

469
01:02:37,156 --> 01:02:38,856
That was an Obscurus.

470
01:02:41,713 --> 01:02:43,709
You go too far, Mr. Scamander.

471
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:47,681
There is no Obscurial in America.

472
01:02:50,424 --> 01:02:54,589
Impound that case, Graves!
-Wait. No. Give that back. -Arrest them!

473
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:01,415
Don’t hurt those creatures.

474
01:03:01,883 --> 01:03:05,436
Please, you don’t understand, nothing
in there is dangerous, nothing!

475
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,459
We’ll be the judges of that!
Take them to the cells!

476
01:03:09,815 --> 01:03:12,920
Don’t hurt those creatures, nothing
in there is dangerous!

477
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:17,674
Please, don’t hurt my creatures! They aren't
dangerous! Please, they are not dangerous!

478
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:20,181
They are not dangerous!

479
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,243
I am so sorry about your
creatures, Mr. Scamander.

480
01:03:31,152 --> 01:03:32,852
I truly am.

481
01:03:34,217 --> 01:03:38,773
Can someone please tell me what this
Obscurial—Obscurius thing is? Please?

482
01:03:41,132 --> 01:03:43,160
There hasn’t been one for centuries.

483
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,103
I met one in Sudan three months ago.

484
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:51,824
There used to be more of
them but they still exist.

485
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,687
Before wizards went underground,

486
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:01,367
when we were still
being hunted by Muggles,

487
01:04:02,829 --> 01:04:06,998
young wizards and witches sometimes
tried to suppress their magic

488
01:04:07,033 --> 01:04:08,733
to avoid persecution.

489
01:04:09,932 --> 01:04:13,047
Instead of learning to harness
or to control their powers,

490
01:04:14,676 --> 01:04:17,366
they developed what
was called an Obscurus.

491
01:04:20,548 --> 01:04:24,852
It’s an unstable, uncontrollable Dark
force that busts out and attacks...

492
01:04:28,191 --> 01:04:29,891
And then vanishes.

493
01:04:33,626 --> 01:04:36,335
Obscurials can’t
survive long, can they?

494
01:04:36,365 --> 01:04:40,092
There’s no documented case of any
Obscurial surviving past the age of ten.

495
01:04:42,102 --> 01:04:45,116
The one I met in Africa
was eight when she...

496
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:50,913
She was eight when she died.

497
01:04:54,575 --> 01:04:59,298
What are you telling me here, that
Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?

498
01:05:04,778 --> 01:05:08,190
My momma, your momma,
flying on a switch.

499
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,806
My momma, your momma,
witches never cry.

500
01:05:12,334 --> 01:05:15,214
My momma, your momma,
witches gonna die!

501
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:19,124
Witch number one, drown in
a river!

502
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:22,669
Witch number two,
gotta noose to give her!

503
01:05:22,704 --> 01:05:24,970
Hand out your leaflets!
-Witch number three...

504
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:29,992
I’ll know if you dump ’em. Tell
me if you see anything suspicious.

505
01:06:00,008 --> 01:06:04,586
It was good to make your acquaintance,
Jacob, and I hope you get your bakery.

506
01:06:15,863 --> 01:06:19,918
You’re an interesting man, Mr. Scamander.
-Mr. Graves...

507
01:06:28,558 --> 01:06:31,513
You were thrown out of Hogwarts
for endangering human life...

508
01:06:31,548 --> 01:06:33,595
That was an accident!
-With a beast.

509
01:06:34,337 --> 01:06:38,990
Yet one of your teachers argued
strongly against your expulsion.

510
01:06:40,768 --> 01:06:45,630
What makes Albus
Dumbledore so fond of you?

511
01:06:50,926 --> 01:06:52,626
I really couldn’t say.

512
01:06:52,684 --> 01:06:56,719
So setting a pack of dangerous
creatures loose here was...

513
01:06:59,452 --> 01:07:04,306
Was just another accident, is that right?
-Why would I do it deliberately?

514
01:07:04,341 --> 01:07:06,041
To expose wizardkind.

515
01:07:07,244 --> 01:07:11,137
To provoke war between the
magical and non-magical worlds.

516
01:07:11,172 --> 01:07:13,685
Mass slaughter for the
greater good, you mean?

517
01:07:16,316 --> 01:07:18,920
Yes. Quite.

518
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:23,948
I’m not one of Grindelwald’s
fanatics, Mr. Graves.

519
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:32,223
I wonder what you can tell
me about this, Mr. Scamander?

520
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,437
It’s an Obscurus.
But it’s not what you think.

521
01:07:49,501 --> 01:07:53,453
I managed to separate it from the
Sudanese girl as I tried to save her.

522
01:07:53,554 --> 01:07:55,757
Wanted to take it home, to study it.

523
01:07:55,792 --> 01:07:59,083
But it cannot survive outside that
box, it could not hurt anyone, Tina!

524
01:07:59,251 --> 01:08:00,951
So it’s useless without the host?

525
01:08:02,221 --> 01:08:05,765
"Useless?" "Useless?"

526
01:08:08,602 --> 01:08:14,874
That is a parasitical magical force that killed
a child. What on earth would you use it for?

527
01:08:21,695 --> 01:08:23,695
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.

528
01:08:23,896 --> 01:08:27,548
You brought this Obscurus into the city of New
York in the hope of causing mass disruption,

529
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:30,356
breaking the Statute of Secrecy
and revealing the magical world.

530
01:08:30,391 --> 01:08:33,640
You know that can’t hurt anyone, you know that!
-You are therefore guilty of a treasonous betrayal

531
01:08:33,675 --> 01:08:36,008
of your fellow wizards
and are sentenced to death.

532
01:08:36,014 --> 01:08:38,842
Miss Goldstein, who has
aided and abetted you...

533
01:08:38,877 --> 01:08:41,551
No, she’s done nothing of the kind.
-She receives the same sentence.

534
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:48,704
Just do it immediately. I will inform
President Picquery myself. -Tina.

535
01:08:50,312 --> 01:08:52,012
Please.

536
01:09:05,118 --> 01:09:07,081
Don’t do this, Bernadette, please...

537
01:09:08,942 --> 01:09:10,642
It don't hurt.

538
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:52,587
Tina...
-Momma... -Tina...

539
01:09:54,348 --> 01:09:59,120
Come on, pumpkin, time
for bed. Are you ready?

540
01:09:59,307 --> 01:10:01,552
Don’t that look good?

541
01:10:06,085 --> 01:10:07,785
You wanna get in? Huh?

542
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:19,628
Hey, Sam! -Hey, Queenie.
-They need you downstairs.

543
01:10:19,663 --> 01:10:22,593
I’ll obliviate this guy.
-You ain’t qualified.

544
01:10:24,106 --> 01:10:27,568
Hey, Sam, does Cecily
know you been seeing Ruby?

545
01:10:30,094 --> 01:10:33,837
How’d you... -Let me obliviate this guy
and she’ll never hear about it from me.

546
01:10:37,588 --> 01:10:41,487
What are you doin’? -Shh! Teen’s
in trouble, I’m trying to listen...

547
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:44,589
Jacob, where’s Newt’s case?
-I think that guy Graves took it.

548
01:10:45,577 --> 01:10:48,425
Okay, come on. -What? You’re
not gonna obliviate me?

549
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:52,529
Of course not, you’re one of us now!

550
01:11:20,904 --> 01:11:22,604
It’s okay.

551
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:34,050
Alohomora.

552
01:11:36,575 --> 01:11:38,275
Aberto...

553
01:11:38,776 --> 01:11:41,708
He would know a fancy
spell to lock his office.

554
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:47,218
Okay, let’s get the good stuff out of you.

555
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:08,864
Witch!

556
01:12:19,685 --> 01:12:24,489
It's just gonna eat me! -Don't panic!
-What do you suggest I do instead?

557
01:12:30,127 --> 01:12:31,827
Jump.

558
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:37,277
Are you crazy?
-Jump on him.

559
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:43,321
Tina, listen to me. I’ll catch you.

560
01:12:44,348 --> 01:12:46,048
Tina!

561
01:12:51,316 --> 01:12:53,016
I’ll catch you.

562
01:12:54,424 --> 01:12:57,298
I’ve got you, Tina. Go!

563
01:13:02,847 --> 01:13:04,547
Come on!

564
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,540
Coming through!
-Move!

565
01:13:22,978 --> 01:13:25,437
Leave his brains, come on!
Come on!

566
01:13:29,365 --> 01:13:33,507
What is that thing? -Swooping
Evil. -Well, I love it!

567
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,940
Get in.

568
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:01,791
Queenie!

569
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:08,101
Where you going?

570
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:11,937
I’m sick, Mr. Abernathy.

571
01:14:14,257 --> 01:14:15,957
Again?

572
01:14:17,361 --> 01:14:21,621
Well, what’ve you got there?
-Ladies’ things.

573
01:14:21,962 --> 01:14:24,205
You wanna take a look? I don’t mind.

574
01:14:24,387 --> 01:14:27,592
Good gravy, no! I...

575
01:14:28,912 --> 01:14:32,987
You get well now!
-Thanks.

576
01:14:46,669 --> 01:14:48,580
Credence. Have you found the child?

577
01:14:50,512 --> 01:14:54,423
I can’t.
-Show me.

578
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:09,618
Shh. My boy, the sooner we find this child, the sooner
you can put that pain in the past where it belongs.

579
01:15:12,276 --> 01:15:14,158
I want you to have this, Credence.

580
01:15:15,394 --> 01:15:18,866
I would trust very few with it.

581
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:22,421
Very few.

582
01:15:25,272 --> 01:15:26,972
But you...

583
01:15:28,976 --> 01:15:30,676
You’re different.

584
01:15:31,422 --> 01:15:36,122
When you find the child, touch this symbol
and I will know, and I will come to you.

585
01:15:38,468 --> 01:15:44,861
Do this and you will be
honored among wizards. Forever.

586
01:15:48,312 --> 01:15:50,210
The child is dying,
Credence.

587
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,800
Time is running out.

588
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:12,748
Your grandfather kept
pigeons? Mine bred owls.

589
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:17,238
I used to love feeding ’em.
-Graves always insisted

590
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:21,568
the disturbances were caused by a beast.
We need to catch all your creatures

591
01:16:21,569 --> 01:16:23,766
so he can’t keep using
them as a scapegoat.

592
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:26,882
There’s only one still
missing. Dougal, my Demiguise.

593
01:16:27,908 --> 01:16:31,770
Dougal?
-Slight problem is that...

594
01:16:31,805 --> 01:16:33,505
He’s invisible.

595
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,613
Invisible?
-Yes, most of the time... He does...

596
01:16:43,325 --> 01:16:46,138
How do you catch something that?
-With immense difficulty.

597
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:57,979
Gnarlak!
-Excuse me?

598
01:16:58,393 --> 01:17:01,873
Gnarlak, he was an informant
of mine when I was an Auror!

599
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:06,159
He used to trade in magical
creatures on the side.

600
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:09,111
He wouldn’t happen to have an
interest in paw prints, would he?

601
01:17:11,574 --> 01:17:14,064
He’s interested in anything he can sell.

602
01:18:09,516 --> 01:18:11,416
How do I get a drink in this joint?

603
01:18:13,124 --> 01:18:15,393
What? Ain’t you ever
seen a house-elf before?

604
01:18:16,033 --> 01:18:19,409
No, no, of course I have.
I love house-elves.

605
01:18:20,438 --> 01:18:22,138
My uncle’s a house-elf.

606
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:25,477
Yeah...

607
01:18:27,629 --> 01:18:30,665
Six shots of gigglewater
and a lobe blaster, please.

608
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:40,654
Are all No-Majs like you?

609
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:43,760
No, I’m the only one like me.

610
01:19:02,896 --> 01:19:04,768
I’ve arrested half of the people in here.

611
01:19:05,388 --> 01:19:08,315
You can tell me to mind my own
business, but I saw something

612
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:10,492
in that death potion back there.

613
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:15,893
I saw you hugging
that Second Salem boy.

614
01:19:15,928 --> 01:19:20,724
His name’s Credence.
His mother beats him.

615
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:26,510
She beats all those kids she adopted,
but she seems to hate him the most.

616
01:19:29,194 --> 01:19:31,334
And she was the No-Maj you attacked?

617
01:19:32,816 --> 01:19:34,971
That’s how I lost my job.

618
01:19:35,568 --> 01:19:38,484
I went for her in front of a
meeting of her crazy followers.

619
01:19:39,493 --> 01:19:42,673
They all had to be obliviated.
It was a big scandal.

620
01:19:43,221 --> 01:19:44,921
It’s him.

621
01:19:52,577 --> 01:19:54,423
So...

622
01:19:56,886 --> 01:19:59,357
You’re the guy with the
case full of monsters, huh?

623
01:20:00,089 --> 01:20:02,019
News travels fast.

624
01:20:03,205 --> 01:20:07,125
I was hoping you’d be able to tell
me if there have been any sightings.

625
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,060
Tracks. That sort of thing.

626
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:14,861
You’ve got a big price on
your head, Mr. Scamander.

627
01:20:16,273 --> 01:20:19,989
Why should I help you
instead of turnin’ you in?

628
01:20:20,371 --> 01:20:22,375
I take it I’ll have to
make it worth your while?

629
01:20:23,835 --> 01:20:25,989
Let’s consider it a cover charge.

630
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,740
MACUSA’s offerin’ more’n that.

631
01:20:37,994 --> 01:20:40,019
Lunascope?

632
01:20:41,933 --> 01:20:43,633
I got five.

633
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:53,349
Frozen Ashwinder egg!
-You see, now we’re...

634
01:20:55,636 --> 01:20:57,413
Wait a minute.

635
01:20:59,619 --> 01:21:02,999
That's Bow...
That’s a Bowtruckle, right?

636
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:07,571
No. -Come on.
They pick locks, am I right?

637
01:21:08,192 --> 01:21:12,846
You’re not having him.
-Well,

638
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:15,964
good luck gettin’ back alive,

639
01:21:15,999 --> 01:21:18,559
Mr. Scamander, what with the
whole of MACUSA on your back.

640
01:21:21,047 --> 01:21:22,747
All right.

641
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:33,117
Pickett...

642
01:21:44,547 --> 01:21:47,752
Somethin’ invisible’s been
wreakin’ havoc around Fifth Avenue.

643
01:21:48,618 --> 01:21:50,894
You may wanna check out
Macy’s department store.

644
01:21:50,935 --> 01:21:55,896
Might help with what you’re looking
for. -Dougal... One last thing.

645
01:21:56,554 --> 01:21:59,106
There’s a Mr. Graves
who works at MACUSA.

646
01:21:59,865 --> 01:22:02,070
I was wondering what you
knew of his background.

647
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:05,808
You ask a lot of
questions, Mr. Scamander.

648
01:22:07,874 --> 01:22:09,652
That can get you killed.

649
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:16,632
MACUSA are coming!
-You tipped them off!

650
01:22:24,257 --> 01:22:25,957
Sorry, Mr. Gnarlak...

651
01:22:28,905 --> 01:22:30,605
Reminds me of my foreman!

652
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:04,094
What are you doin’, Credence?

653
01:23:11,764 --> 01:23:16,052
Where’d you get this?
-Give it back, Credence. It’s just a toy!

654
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,500
What is this?

655
01:23:26,586 --> 01:23:28,286
Take it off!

656
01:23:53,092 --> 01:23:55,072
Ma...
-I am not your Ma!

657
01:23:57,808 --> 01:24:02,540
Your mother was a
wicked, unnatural woman!

658
01:24:04,209 --> 01:24:08,999
It was mine.
-Modesty...

659
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:23,059
What is this?

660
01:25:15,155 --> 01:25:16,867
So Demiguises are
fundamentally peaceful,

661
01:25:17,989 --> 01:25:20,759
but they can give a
nasty nip if provoked.

662
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:25,131
You two, head that way.

663
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:28,301
And try very hard not to be predictable.

664
01:25:33,286 --> 01:25:35,056
Was that the Demiguise?

665
01:25:35,057 --> 01:25:38,306
No, I think it might be the
reason that the Demiguise is here.

666
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:56,216
Its sight operates on probability,

667
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:59,438
so it can foresee the most
likely immediate future.

668
01:26:01,393 --> 01:26:05,968
So what’s it doing?
-It’s babysitting.

669
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:10,432
What did you just say?
-This is my fault.

670
01:26:12,014 --> 01:26:15,476
I thought I had them all,
but I must have miscounted.

671
01:26:20,616 --> 01:26:22,540
It was babysitting that?

672
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:38,462
Occamies are choranaptyxic.

673
01:26:38,908 --> 01:26:40,876
So they grow to fill available space.

674
01:26:45,815 --> 01:26:47,515
Mummy’s here.

675
01:27:08,528 --> 01:27:13,116
We need an insect, any
kind of insect and a teapot!

676
01:27:14,465 --> 01:27:16,698
Find a teapot!

677
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:41,322
I got it. I got it!

678
01:27:44,484 --> 01:27:46,184
Teapot!

679
01:27:58,843 --> 01:28:01,348
Roach in teapot...

680
01:28:56,269 --> 01:28:57,969
Choranaptyxic.

681
01:28:59,259 --> 01:29:02,013
They also shrink to
fit the available space.

682
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:10,543
Tell me the truth.

683
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:15,161
Was that everything that came out
of the case? -That’s everything.

684
01:29:16,253 --> 01:29:17,953
And that’s the truth.

685
01:29:21,605 --> 01:29:25,717
Here she comes.
-Happy to be home?

686
01:29:26,355 --> 01:29:31,020
Bet you’re exhausted, buddy. Come
on. There you go, that’s right.

687
01:29:57,569 --> 01:30:00,347
Right. I think we need to talk.

688
01:30:05,045 --> 01:30:06,944
I wouldn’t have let
him keep you, Pickett.

689
01:30:07,952 --> 01:30:10,466
Pick, I would rather chop off
my hand than get rid of you.

690
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:12,603
After everything you have
done for me, now come on.

691
01:30:14,539 --> 01:30:17,382
Pick, we’ve talked about
sulking before, haven’t we?

692
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:19,812
Pickett...

693
01:30:21,535 --> 01:30:24,595
Come on, give me a smile.
Pickett, give me a...

694
01:30:26,597 --> 01:30:29,791
All right. Now, that is beneath you.

695
01:30:37,704 --> 01:30:39,404
Newt.

696
01:30:41,023 --> 01:30:44,992
Who is she?
-That’s no one.

697
01:30:46,594 --> 01:30:51,335
Leta Lestrange? I’ve heard of that family.

698
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:56,729
Aren’t they kinda, you know?
-Please don’t read my mind.

699
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:12,885
Sorry, I asked you not to.
-I know, I’m sorry.

700
01:31:13,909 --> 01:31:15,609
I can’t help it.

701
01:31:16,706 --> 01:31:19,625
People are easiest to read when
they’re hurting. -I’m not hurting.

702
01:31:21,495 --> 01:31:23,488
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

703
01:31:32,669 --> 01:31:34,747
That was a real close
friendship you had at school.

704
01:31:37,807 --> 01:31:40,942
Neither of us really fitted in at school.

705
01:31:41,949 --> 01:31:44,762
So we became quite...
-You became real close.

706
01:31:46,191 --> 01:31:47,891
For years.

707
01:31:51,707 --> 01:31:56,538
She was a taker. You need a giver.

708
01:31:57,655 --> 01:32:01,677
What are you two talking about?
-Nothing.

709
01:32:02,126 --> 01:32:03,826
School.
-School.

710
01:32:04,242 --> 01:32:09,113
Did you say school? Is there a school?

711
01:32:09,114 --> 01:32:12,723
A wizardry school here? In America?

712
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:18,198
Of course, Ilvermorny! It’s only the
best wizard school in the whole world!

713
01:32:18,233 --> 01:32:21,177
I think you’ll find the best wizarding
school in the world is Hogwarts!

714
01:32:22,505 --> 01:32:24,205
Hogwash!

715
01:32:34,179 --> 01:32:35,879
Danger.

716
01:32:38,109 --> 01:32:39,809
He senses danger.

717
01:33:19,775 --> 01:33:22,416
The Obscurial was here?

718
01:33:23,232 --> 01:33:24,932
Where did she go?

719
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:31,080
Help me. Help me.

720
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:35,519
Didn’t you tell me
you had another sister?

721
01:33:37,879 --> 01:33:39,579
Please help me.

722
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:42,858
Where’s your other sister, Credence?
-Please, help me. -The little one?

723
01:33:42,893 --> 01:33:44,593
Where did she go?
-Please...

724
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:51,143
Your sister’s in grave danger.

725
01:33:52,588 --> 01:33:54,288
We need to find her.

726
01:34:03,225 --> 01:34:06,714
What is this place?
-Ma adopted Modesty out of here.

727
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:09,120
From a family of twelve.

728
01:34:09,826 --> 01:34:13,002
She misses her brothers and
sisters. She still talks about them.

729
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:17,033
Where is she?

730
01:34:18,832 --> 01:34:23,225
I don't know.
-You’re a Squib, Credence.

731
01:34:24,031 --> 01:34:26,871
I could smell it off
you the minute I met you.

732
01:34:27,997 --> 01:34:32,753
What?
-You have magical ancestry, but no power.

733
01:34:34,149 --> 01:34:37,562
But you said you could teach me.
-You’re unteachable.

734
01:34:37,597 --> 01:34:40,330
Your mother’s dead. That’s your reward.

735
01:34:41,966 --> 01:34:43,666
I’m done with you.

736
01:34:52,226 --> 01:34:53,926
Modesty?

737
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,320
Modesty.

738
01:35:08,276 --> 01:35:11,692
There’s no need to be afraid.

739
01:35:14,018 --> 01:35:16,052
I’m here with your brother, Credence.

740
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,140
Out you come, now.

741
01:35:58,574 --> 01:36:02,234
Credence, I owe you an apology.

742
01:36:03,818 --> 01:36:05,634
I trusted you.

743
01:36:08,617 --> 01:36:12,626
I thought you were my friend.
That you were different.

744
01:36:14,885 --> 01:36:17,902
You can control it, Credence.

745
01:36:23,984 --> 01:36:25,702
But I don’t think I want to, Mr. Graves.

746
01:36:50,214 --> 01:36:53,966
Jeez. Is that the Obscuriathing?

747
01:36:56,204 --> 01:36:59,141
That’s more powerful than any
Obscurial I have ever heard of.

748
01:37:02,987 --> 01:37:06,264
If I don’t come back,
look after my creatures.

749
01:37:07,265 --> 01:37:12,640
Everything that you
need to know is in there. -What?

750
01:37:12,991 --> 01:37:14,691
They’re not killing it.

751
01:37:17,434 --> 01:37:20,947
Newt! You heard him, look after them!

752
01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:25,744
Keep holda that, honey.
-No, no, no!

753
01:37:27,988 --> 01:37:32,374
I can’t take you. Please let go of me, Jacob!

754
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:38,546
You’re the one that said I was one
of youse, right? -It’s too dangerous.

755
01:38:09,663 --> 01:38:14,598
To survive so long, with
this inside you, Credence,

756
01:38:16,611 --> 01:38:20,879
is a miracle. You are a miracle.

757
01:38:21,799 --> 01:38:26,083
Come with me, think of what
we could achieve together.

758
01:38:41,055 --> 01:38:44,389
Newt! -It’s the Second Salem
boy. He’s the Obscurial.

759
01:38:44,424 --> 01:38:46,124
He’s not a child.

760
01:38:46,427 --> 01:38:50,842
His power must be so strong,
he’s somehow managed to survive.

761
01:38:54,933 --> 01:38:58,908
Newt! Save him.

762
01:39:05,929 --> 01:39:07,629
Mr. Graves.

763
01:39:20,255 --> 01:39:22,962
Tina. You’re always turning
up where you are least wanted.

764
01:39:35,171 --> 01:39:39,591
Contain this, or we are
exposed and it will mean war.

765
01:39:50,174 --> 01:39:54,146
Credence! Credence, I can help you.

766
01:41:33,207 --> 01:41:36,285
Bar the area. -Yes, sir.
-I don’t want anyone else down there!

767
01:41:48,948 --> 01:41:50,648
Credence...

768
01:41:52,897 --> 01:41:54,597
It’s Credence, isn’t it?

769
01:41:57,724 --> 01:42:00,031
I’m here to help you, Credence.

770
01:42:01,085 --> 01:42:02,801
I’m not here to hurt you.

771
01:42:23,354 --> 01:42:25,498
I’ve met someone just like you, Credence.

772
01:42:28,975 --> 01:42:30,720
A girl.

773
01:42:31,928 --> 01:42:34,508
A young girl who’d been imprisoned,

774
01:42:36,227 --> 01:42:41,592
she had been locked away and
she’d been punished for her magic.

775
01:42:58,663 --> 01:43:00,940
Credence...

776
01:43:03,068 --> 01:43:04,768
Can I come over to you?

777
01:43:08,287 --> 01:43:09,987
Can I come over?

778
01:43:39,527 --> 01:43:43,344
That thing killed my son.
I want justice!

779
01:43:44,257 --> 01:43:47,618
I’ll expose you for who you
are and what you’ve done.

780
01:44:11,605 --> 01:44:13,305
Look! Take... Take photos.

781
01:44:41,247 --> 01:44:42,947
Credence.

782
01:45:21,678 --> 01:45:23,378
Credence, no!

783
01:45:28,923 --> 01:45:32,977
Don’t do this.
Please.

784
01:45:33,638 --> 01:45:35,413
Keep talking, Tina.

785
01:45:37,052 --> 01:45:40,488
Keep talking to him, he’ll
listen to you. He’s listening.

786
01:45:43,775 --> 01:45:45,623
I know what that woman did to you.

787
01:45:50,204 --> 01:45:52,085
I know that you’ve suffered.

788
01:45:54,658 --> 01:45:56,695
You need to stop this now.

789
01:45:59,283 --> 01:46:01,477
Newt and I will protect you.

790
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:09,286
This man... He is using you.
-Don’t listen to her, Credence.

791
01:46:10,589 --> 01:46:12,289
I want you to be free.

792
01:46:14,038 --> 01:46:18,299
It’s all right.
-That’s it.

793
01:46:28,364 --> 01:46:30,488
Don’t, you’ll frighten him.
-Wands down!

794
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:35,889
Anyone harms him, they’ll
answer to me. Credence! -Credence...

795
01:46:38,074 --> 01:46:39,774
No. No!

796
01:47:14,302 --> 01:47:18,745
Credence...
You fools.

797
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:22,030
Do you realize what you’ve done?

798
01:47:22,388 --> 01:47:26,955
The Obscurial was killed on
my orders, Mr. Graves. -Yes.

799
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:30,779
And history will surely
note that, Madam President.

800
01:47:31,024 --> 01:47:33,409
What was done here tonight was not right!

801
01:47:33,444 --> 01:47:35,715
He was responsible for
the death of a No-Maj.

802
01:47:36,211 --> 01:47:38,235
He risked the exposure
of our community.

803
01:47:38,302 --> 01:47:40,562
He has broken one of
our most sacred laws.

804
01:47:40,563 --> 01:47:43,872
A law that has us scuttling
like rats in the gutter!

805
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:46,488
A law that demands that
we conceal our true nature!

806
01:47:46,523 --> 01:47:49,729
A law that directs those under
its dominion to cower in fear

807
01:47:49,764 --> 01:47:51,665
lest we risk discovery!

808
01:47:54,258 --> 01:47:56,264
I ask you, Madam President.

809
01:47:58,196 --> 01:48:00,050
I ask all of you...

810
01:48:01,858 --> 01:48:03,558
Who does this law protect?

811
01:48:06,002 --> 01:48:07,702
Us?

812
01:48:09,517 --> 01:48:11,217
Or them?

813
01:48:17,819 --> 01:48:19,519
I refuse to bow down any longer.

814
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:24,304
Aurors, I’d like you to
relieve Mr. Graves of his wand

815
01:48:24,339 --> 01:48:26,328
and escort him back to...

816
01:48:59,846 --> 01:49:01,546
Accio.

817
01:49:10,732 --> 01:49:12,432
Revelio.

818
01:49:36,824 --> 01:49:39,028
Do you think you can hold me?

819
01:49:41,281 --> 01:49:44,202
We’ll do our best, Mr. Grindelwald.

820
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,339
Will we die, just a little?

821
01:50:18,777 --> 01:50:21,814
I figured somebody oughta
keep an eye on this thing.

822
01:50:26,985 --> 01:50:29,722
Thank you. -We owe you
an apology, Mr. Scamander.

823
01:50:31,239 --> 01:50:33,465
But the magical community is exposed!

824
01:50:34,255 --> 01:50:37,051
We cannot obliviate an entire city.

825
01:50:42,543 --> 01:50:46,247
Actually, I think we can.

826
01:51:12,867 --> 01:51:15,487
I was intending to wait
until we got to Arizona,

827
01:51:18,825 --> 01:51:21,547
but it seems like now you
are our only hope, Frank.

828
01:51:40,989 --> 01:51:42,689
I’ll miss you too.

829
01:51:54,801 --> 01:51:56,501
You know what you’ve got to do.

830
01:54:23,982 --> 01:54:25,682
They won’t remember anything.

831
01:54:26,633 --> 01:54:29,742
That venom has incredibly
powerful obliviative properties.

832
01:54:32,622 --> 01:54:34,672
We owe you a great
debt, Mr. Scamander.

833
01:54:37,896 --> 01:54:41,004
Now, get that case out of New York.

834
01:54:42,161 --> 01:54:43,861
Yes, Madam President.

835
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:51,767
Is that No-Maj still here?

836
01:54:56,905 --> 01:55:00,131
Obliviate him. There can be no exceptions.

837
01:55:01,803 --> 01:55:05,824
I’m sorry, but even one witness.
You know the law.

838
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:12,125
I’ll let you say good-bye.

839
01:55:27,141 --> 01:55:28,841
This is for the best.

840
01:55:29,237 --> 01:55:34,355
Yeah, I was, I was never
even supposed to be here.

841
01:55:35,456 --> 01:55:40,288
I was never supposed to know any of this.

842
01:55:45,176 --> 01:55:48,052
Everybody knows Newt only
kept me around because...

843
01:55:50,945 --> 01:55:53,082
Newt, why did you keep me around?

844
01:55:55,494 --> 01:55:57,194
Because I like you.

845
01:55:59,079 --> 01:56:01,508
Because you’re my friend

846
01:56:02,374 --> 01:56:05,089
and I’ll never forget
how you helped me, Jacob.

847
01:56:09,527 --> 01:56:11,227
I’ll come with you.

848
01:56:12,153 --> 01:56:14,666
We’ll go somewhere, we’ll go anywhere.

849
01:56:16,199 --> 01:56:20,237
See, I ain’t never gonna find anyone like.

850
01:56:22,973 --> 01:56:27,027
There’s loads like me.
-No. No.

851
01:56:28,715 --> 01:56:30,415
There’s only one like you.

852
01:56:36,818 --> 01:56:38,518
I gotta go.

853
01:56:43,321 --> 01:56:47,691
Jacob!
-It’s okay. It’s okay.

854
01:56:49,676 --> 01:56:51,376
It’s okay.

855
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:57,350
It’s just like waking up, right?

856
01:59:01,004 --> 01:59:02,704
So sorry, sorry!

857
01:59:19,644 --> 01:59:23,511
Dear Mr. Kowalski, You are
wasted in a canning factory.

858
01:59:26,753 --> 01:59:30,238
Please take these Occamy eggshells
as collateral for your bakery.

859
01:59:30,542 --> 01:59:32,242
A well-wisher.

860
01:59:55,705 --> 01:59:57,840
It’s been...
-Hasn’t it?

861
02:00:02,431 --> 02:00:06,717
Listen, Newt, I wanted to thank you.

862
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:08,950
What on earth for?

863
02:00:09,484 --> 02:00:13,959
Well, you know, if you hadn’t said all
those nice things to Madam Picquery about me,

864
02:00:13,994 --> 02:00:16,493
I wouldn’t be back on the
investigative team now.

865
02:00:18,473 --> 02:00:22,282
Well, I can’t think of anyone that
I’d rather have investigating me.

866
02:00:24,603 --> 02:00:27,905
Try not to need
investigating for a bit. -I will.

867
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:30,156
Quiet life for me from now on.

868
02:00:30,824 --> 02:00:35,797
Back to the Ministry. Deliver my
manuscript. -I’ll look out for it.

869
02:00:36,139 --> 02:00:38,061
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

870
02:00:44,789 --> 02:00:46,941
Does Leta Lestrange like to read?

871
02:00:48,431 --> 02:00:53,144
Who?
-The girl whose picture you carry.

872
02:00:56,038 --> 02:01:02,106
I don’t really know what Leta likes
these days because people change.

873
02:01:02,733 --> 02:01:04,433
Yes.
-I’ve changed.

874
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:10,334
I think. Maybe a little.

875
02:01:20,570 --> 02:01:24,957
I’ll send you a copy of my book, if I may.
-I’d like that.

876
02:01:43,437 --> 02:01:47,144
I’m so sorry. How would you feel
if I gave you your copy in person?

877
02:01:50,636 --> 02:01:52,336
I’d like that.

878
02:01:55,355 --> 02:01:57,055
Very much.

879
02:03:14,221 --> 02:03:17,527
Where do you get your ideas from, Mr. Kowalski?
-I don’t know.

880
02:03:17,959 --> 02:03:22,053
I don't know.
They just come.

881
02:03:22,339 --> 02:03:25,069
Here you go. Don’t forget this. Enjoy.

882
02:03:26,150 --> 02:03:28,909
Hey, Henry, storage, all right?

883
02:03:29,595 --> 02:03:31,295
Thanks, pal.

884
02:03:57,155 --> 02:03:59,560
