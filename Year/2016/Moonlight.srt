00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,428
Look, man, I don't mean no disrespect

00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,015
You can't get nothing, man.
You know what time it is, bruh?

13
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,416
I keep looking out for you, man.

14
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,671

Most naturally.
Thank you.

00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,555
Thanks for the opportunity.

Huh?

48
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,536
You don't talk to strangers?

49
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,710
A'ight. It's cool.

00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,458

I'm 'bout to go
get something to eat.

53
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,053
You're welcome to join me
if you want.

54
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,226
It's okay if I take the front door?

55
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,063
Hmm?

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,173

You not gonna tell me

59
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,402
How 'bout where you live?

I gotta get you home,
li'l man.

61
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,965
Can't have you just runnin'

62
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,386
You understand?

63
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,681
Hmm?

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, my bad.

Oh, man, you know
I ain't gonna do you like that.

66
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,660
Hey, man, I apologize,

67
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,206
I'm just trying to get
you to say something.

68
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,783
Hey...

69
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,998
I apologize.

70
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,329
Hmm?

71
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,593
All right.

72
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,252
All right.

73
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,921
You all right now...

74
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,928

75
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,764
She gon' make you talk.

00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,435
I'll be right back.

77
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,360
- Teresa!
- Hey, baby.

78
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,707
- I found this little boy in a dope spot.
- Found a little boy in a what?

79
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,833
Wasn't no crackheads up in there.
He by himself.

80
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,173
He ain't talking though,

81
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,684
so why don't you see
if you can get him to say something?

82
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,925
Really?

83
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,924
Just go talk to him.
Just go talk to him.

84
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,095
I cannot believe you.

85
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,389
- Love you.
- Why would you do something like this?

86
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,266
You don't talk much,
but you damn sure can eat.

87
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,891
That's all right, baby.

88
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,314
You ain't got to talk
'til you get good and ready.

89
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,404
My name is Chiron.

90
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,610
People call me Little.

91
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,159
All right then, Little.

92
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,831
Well, Imma call you by your name, then.

93
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,833
Where you from, Chiron?

94
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,790
Liberty City.

95
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,835
You live with your mama?

96
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,633
Yes.

97
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,305
What about your daddy?

98
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,264
That's all right.

99
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,851
You want us
to take you home, then,

100
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,857
after you get finished
eating your food?

101
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,234
Yeah, you gotta tell us
where you live, bruh.

102
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,077
No...

103
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,657
Okay.

104
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,873
You can stay here tonight.

105
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,420
Teresa...

106
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,464
Would you like that?

107
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,511
Okay.

108
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,805
What happened?

109
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,134
Huh?

110
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,934
What happened, Chiron?

111
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,889
Why you didn't come home
like you supposed to? Huh?

112
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,268
And who is you?

113
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,943
Nobody.

114
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,609
I found him yesterday.

115
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,657
Found him in a hole on 15th.

116
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,862
Yeah. That one.

117
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,575
Some boys chased him in the cut.
He's scared more than anything.

118
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,786
He wouldn't tell me where
he lived 'til this morning.

119
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,622
Well, thanks for seeing to him.

120
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,128
He usually can
take care of hisself.

121
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,048
He good that way, but...

122
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,592
Little man.

123
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,741
You a real damn prize, Chiron.
You know that?

124
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,250
You got'sta come home

125
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,705
You hear?

126
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,636
That's all right, baby.

127
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,930
That's all right.

128
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,393
Mama just glad you're home.

129
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,111
Nuh-uh.

130
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,743
TV privileges revoked.

131
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,250
Find something for you to read.

132
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,371
- Where the ball at?
- I don't got the ball no more!

133
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,572
Hey, Little!

134
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,950
Wassup, man?

135
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,910
Hey, Kevin.

136
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,959
Why'd you leave?

137
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,460
I don't know.

138
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,884
Yeah, it get borin' after a while.

139
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,934
What? It's bleedin'?

140
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,318
- What?
- You funny, man.

141
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,239
Why you say that?

142
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,195
Just is, that's all.

143
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,334
<i>Why do you always let people
pick on you, man?</i>

144
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,002
<i>What you mean?</i>

145
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,125
You always letting them pick on you.

146
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,502
So? What I gotta do?

147
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,926
All you gotta do is show these niggas
you ain't soft.

148
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,923
- But I ain't soft.
- I know, I know.

149
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,555
But it don't mean nothing
if they don't know.

150
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,264
Come on. You want these fools
to pick on you every day?

151
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,889
See, Little?

152
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,767
I knew you wasn't soft.

153
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,848
Come on, man.

154
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,709
Give me your head.

155
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,381
Here, let your head
rest in my hand. Relax.

156
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,934
I got you, I promise.
I'm not gon' let you go.

157
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,058
Hey, man, I got you.

158
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,107
There you go.
Ten seconds.

159
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,943
Feel that right there?

160
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,731
You're in the middle
of the world, man.

161
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,192
That's good.

162
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,946
Do like this.

163
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,077
Look at you.

164
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,707
More athletic.

165
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,960
There you go...

166
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,711
Yeah.
I think you ready.

167
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,463
I think we got a swimmer.

168
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,512
You wanna try?
You ready to swim?

169
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,344
Go.

Yeah!

172
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,261
<i>Let me tell you
something, man.</i>

173
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,305
<i>There are black people
everywhere.</i>

174
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,096
<i>Remember that, okay?</i>

175
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,154
<i>No place you can go in the world
ain't got no black people.</i>

176
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,055
<i>We's the first on this planet.</i>

177
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,936
I been here a long time.

178
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,023
But I'm from Cuba.

179
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,655
Lot a black folks in Cuba,

180
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,574
you wouldn't know that
from being here, though.

181
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,332
I was a wild li'l shorty, man,
just like you.

182
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,878
Runnin' around with no shoes on
when the moon was out.

183
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,373
This one time...

184
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,091
I run by this old...
this old lady.

185
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,265
I was runnin', hollerin'...
cuttin' a fool, boy.

186
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,432
This old lady, she stopped me.

187
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,854
She said...

188
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,486
"Running around,
catching up all that light.

189
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,318
In moonlight...
black boys look blue.

190
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,244
You blue.

191
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,115
That's what I gon' call you.

192
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,868
Blue."

193
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,960
So your name Blue?

194
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,877
Nah.

195
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,436
At some point you gotta decide
for yourself who you gon' be.

196
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,520
Can't let nobody make
that decision for you.

197
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,245
How you like swimming, man?

198
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,703
Mm?

199
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,421
That much, huh?

200
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,296
Hey, hold up, hold up.

201
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,595
Pick one.

202
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,564
Aah...

203
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,605
Ha, ha. Good choice.

204
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,107
Put it in your pocket.

205
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,366
Hey.

206
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,956
Yo, hold up.
Whoa, whoa, hey...

207
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,675
Come on.

208
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,019
What's going on, Little Man?

209
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,598
Come on!

210
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,706
Man, y'alls the same
as mine.

211
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,534
At least mine don't look
like Freddy Krueger.

212
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,586
Yours ugly as hell.

213
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,005
Mine don't look like no peanut.

214
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,503
Telling you, mine does not
look like no peanut.

215
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,085
Who let his ass in?

216
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,809
Somebody with you?

217
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,185
Man, I swear it was locked.

218
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,060
Man, ain't no foul!
Ain't no foul!

219
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,303
- S'up?!
- Come on, man!

220
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,255
You're dead, baby!
Right in your face!

221
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,006
It's what I paid for.
It ain't what I bought.

222
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,838
Man, that's Grade A quality.
What else you want me to do?

223
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,174
Nigga, this shit look
more like Grade C.

224
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,650
Man, look.
I ain't goin' with that, man!

225
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,236
- I want my money back.
- What?! Ain't no refund, man.

226
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,479
Just stuff it, man.
Keep movin'. Come on.

227
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,560
Yo, what's up?
All right.

228
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,287
Thought you was on vacation
or some shit.

229
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,701
Come on, man, no vacation out here.
I know the work, you know that.

230
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,528
Going to Switzerland or some shit.

231
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,908
Switzerland, man.

232
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,366
Maybe Brazil, you know,
with two bad bitches.

233
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,746
How Peanut working out?

234
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,669
Peanut good, man.
I got him in check.

235
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,744
- He's staying in his place, you know.
- Good, man.

236
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,889
They basin'?

237
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,559
Hell no, you know
I ain't gonna let that go down.

238
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,654
Yo, nigga, you lettin' people

239
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,726

240
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,274
Come on, you know
I ain't gonna let that happen, man.

241
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,976
What the fuck, man?

242
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,996
Yo, nigga, What's up?

243
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,341
Hey, hey, hey, it's all good, man.

244
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,589
- Fuck you doing?

245
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,341

246
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,357
- It's all good...
- Get out the fucking car!

247
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,634
- Calm down, man.
- You shut the fuck up.

248
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,139
What's wrong with you?

249
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,685
Who the hell you think you is? Huh?

250
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,650
Bitch, get the fuck out of here.

251
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:13,367
What, so you gon' raise
my son now? Huh?

252
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,867
You gon' raise my son?

253
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,369
- Yeah... that's what I thought.
- You gon' raise him?!

254
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,922
You gon' keep sellin' me rocks? Huh?

255
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,696
Motherfucker.

256
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:59,451
Don't give me that "You gotta get it
from somewhere" shit, nigga.

257
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,328
I'm gettin' it from you.

258
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,999
But you gon' raise my son,
though, right?

259
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,455
Hmm?

260
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:13,127
- You ever see the way he walk, Juan?
- You watch your damn mouth.

261
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,929
You gon' tell him why the other boys
kick his ass all the time? Huh?

262
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,810
You gon' tell him?

263
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,109
You ain't shit.

264
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,360
Come on! Let's go!

265
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,463
The fuck y'all lookin' at?

266
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,714
Hey, Teresa.
Your boyfriend's here.

267
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,086
Boy.

268
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,797
You talking to me today?

269
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,297
Huh?

270
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,511
Okay. That's all right.

271
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,221
I don't wanna talk to you,
anyway.

272
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,521
You know she got
a crush on you, right?

273
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,530
You all right?

274
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,737
Mm?

275
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,285
You walk all the way here?

276
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,083
All right.

277
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,132
First things first.
You can't sit at my table like that.

278
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,136
You can't sit with your back
to the door, come on.

279
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,515
How you gon' know if somebody
creepin' up on you.

280
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,094
All right, see that?

281
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,020
Now you can see everything.

282
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,873
What's over there?

283
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,256
Saw your mom last night.

284
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,923
I hate her.

285
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,175
Hmm.

286
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,227
Yeah, I bet you do.

287
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,272
I hated my mom, too.

288
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,686
I miss her like hell now, though.

289
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,406
That's all I'm gon' say about that.

290
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,248
Thank you.

291
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,511
What's a faggot?

292
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,902
A faggot is...

293
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,119
a word used
to make gay people feel bad.

294
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,666
- Am I a faggot?
- No.

295
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,042
No.

296
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,919
You can be gay, but you gotta let nobody
call you no faggot.

297
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,510
I mean, unless...

298
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,019
How do I know?

299
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,189
You just do.

300
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,772
I think.

301
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,946
You'll know when you know.

302
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:32,825
Hey...

303
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,289
You ain't gotta know right now,
all right?

304
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,830
Not yet.

305
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,723
Do you sell drugs?

306
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,525
Yeah.

307
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,413
And my mama...

308
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,158
She do drugs, right?

309
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,914
Yeah.

310
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,805
Okay, deoxyribonucleic acid.

311
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,508
Long word, right?
All right, it's basically genes.

312
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,516
I know y'all don't know what that means,
but just hang with me for a second.

313
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,815
So it's basically this long...

314
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,359
Chiron, you need something?

315
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,857
Hey, yo, that nigga forgot
to change his tampon.

316
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,359
I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce.
He just having woman problems today.

317
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,609
Ain't that right, Little?

318
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,128
All right, Terrel,
that's enough.

319
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,630
Nah, can't be enough for Little.

320
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,782
- How much you need, Little?
- Don't call me that!

321
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,092
All right, Terrel, that's it.

322
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:45,371
Hey, what you gonna do, Chiron?
I fuck you up.

323
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,376
Hey, yo, Terrel! Out!

324
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,758
Come on, man.
What's wrong with you?

325
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:04,311
Where were we? So DNA,
it's basically this long molecule...

326
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,948
Imma be waitin'
for your ass, Little.

327
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,838
Come on, Chiron.

328
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,686
Chiron, what's up, man?

329
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,103
Damn, nigga.
You straight spaced, dawg.

330
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,311
Yo, school been out.
You ain't going home?

331
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:55,358
- Uh... What you doin' here?
- Detention, man.

332
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,534
Aimes caught me with this trick
in the stairway.

333
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,407
- Damn.
- Yeah.

334
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:02,581
- With who?
- Damn, you nosey, nigga.

335
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,916
- My bad...
- No, I'm playing, yo.

336
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,789
Look, I wanted
some quick head, you know,

337
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,873
but this chick all like, "Hit that shit,
Kevin. Hit it with that big dick."

338
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,083
Why she got to compliment a nigga for?

339
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,136
So I'm like, "A'ight, like, shit,
we can do this", you know?

340
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,771
So I started
banging her back out, dawg.

341
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,556
I'm talking
I'm banging her back out.

342
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,680
She went and made
all this fucking noise, though.

343
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,853
So Aimes come in,
acting like 5-0 and shit,

344
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,555
almost had my ass suspended, dawg.

345
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:27,948
I talked it out, though, you know.

346
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,117
I told him we was like childhood
sweethearts and all of that,

347
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,018
so I just got detention.
It's cool.

348
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,647
- Cool.
- That stay between us, a'ight?

349
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,530
- Yeah.
- I know you can keep a secret, dawg.

350
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,748
Real talk though, I gotta go, a'ight?
Before this fool change his mind.

351
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,208
All right, Kev.

352
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,665
See you, Black.

353
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,874
- Hey, Mama.
- Uh-uh. You cannot be here tonight.

354
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,210
I got company coming.

355
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,718
Find somewhere for you to be.

356
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,973
Find somewhere for you to be.

357
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,687
All right.

358
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:01,157
Water for me...
and a little gin for you.

359
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,785
Boy, please.

360
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,659
I know Juan used to give you that gin.

361
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,991
But we ain't doing that
up in here, shorty.

362
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,585
You don't think
my joke was funny?

363
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,253
What's wrong?

364
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:26,307
Nothing. I'm good.

365
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:30,762
No. I've seen good
and you ain't it.

366
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,935
Stop putting your head down
in my house. You know my rule.

367
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:39,191
It's all love
and all pride in this house.

368
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,738
You feel me?

369
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,037
I can't hear you.

370
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,864
- Do you feel me?
- Yeah.

371
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,201
- Okay.
- I feel you.

372
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,786
All right.

373
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,094
Thank you for this.

374
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,844
Boy, please, you know you can stay here
any time you need to.

375
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,722
Okay? Any time.

376
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,303
Yeah.

377
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,686
Thank you, Teresa.
I mean it.

378
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,982
Now, if you gon' stay here, though,

379
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,655
you gonna have to learn how to make
a bed better than this, boy.

380
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,238
- What?
- What you mean, "What"?

381
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,490
Give me that.
That ain't how you make up no bed.

382
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,748
You think you slick, too.

383
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,250
You know, do it all wrong so Teresa
can come over here and do it right.

384
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,625
Mm-hmm.

385
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:42,335
I know what you doing.
Oof, you and Juan.

386
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:47,259
Y'all two, thick as thieves.
Give me that.

387
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,738
All right.

388
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,651
Do you need anything else
from me, sweetheart?

389
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,239
- Uh, no, I'm good.
- Okay.

390
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,205
All right, I'm gonna
wake you up in the morning.

391
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,757
You good, Black?

392
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,864
Chiron!

393
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,042
- Hey! Hey, baby!
- Hey, Mama.

394
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,337
- Where'd you go last night?
- What?

395
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,248
Why?

396
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,299
Well, I'm yo' mama, ain't I?

397
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,131
Why you ain't just
come home later, boy?

398
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,056
You had me worried about you.

399
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,764
<i>I guess you getting grown.</i>

400
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,894
I can't be keeping up
with you all the time.

401
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:07,733
Anyway, baby, how Teresa doing?

402
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,235
I ain't seen her since the funeral.

403
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,076
Listen, Mama locked herself
out the door, yeah?

404
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,654
Can you come let her in?

405
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,369
Come on, baby.

406
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,746
Let me in, baby.

407
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,627
Baby, come on.

408
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,338
I thought you said...

409
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,803
Mama, I thought you...

410
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,726
Wait, Mama... Mama!

411
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,200
I need some money.

412
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:01,825
For what?

413
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:05,663
That's my business.
Don't you ask me no shit like that.

414
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,045
- I don't have no money...
- No, no. Don't lie to me, boy.

415
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,503
I'm your mama. That bitch over there
ain't no kin of you.

416
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,634
I'm your blood, remember?

417
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,216
Now I ain't feeling good.

418
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,301
I need something
to help me out.

419
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,888
Come on, baby.

420
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,185
Come on, baby.

421
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,817
Where am I supposed
to get money from?

422
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,237
What?

423
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,691
Teresa ain't give you nothing, huh?

424
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:38,119
Your li'l play-play mama ain't put
something in your hand?

425
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,330
Give me that damn money, Chiron.

426
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,079
Give me the damn money!
Give me the damn money!

427
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,252
I don't have no money!

428
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,501
- Mama, come on...
- Give me the damn money!

429
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,423
All right! All right!

430
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,876
Give me the damn money.

431
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,756
Here, man.

432
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,762
Yes. That is what I thought.

433
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,554
I know that bitch like a hooker
know her trick.

434
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,184
You my child, okay?

435
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:09,268
And tell that bitch
she better not forget it.

436
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,977
Go on to school.

437
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,275
Ain't you late?

438
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,871
So you can see how a lack
of white blood cells

439
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,703
can be dangerous
to the human body, right?

440
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,635
Okay, can anybody explain
what will happen to the body

441
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,838
if there's not enough
white blood cells?

442
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,721
Ain't nobody's leaving this classroom
until I get a response.

443
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,270
This is more important for you
than it is for me, trust me.

444
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,276
- [Terrell Hey, yo, Little!
- Fuck.

445
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,582
Where you going to so fast, huh?

446
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,950
- I'm going home.
- Huh?

447
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,699
Man, I told you. I'm going home!

448
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,246
You think we stupid?
You live over there, nigga.

449
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,199
Oh, no, he going to Teresa house.

450
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,080
Teresa?
That's Juan lady, ain't it?

451
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,503
Oh, yeah. She fine as hell.

452
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,580
- Juan been dead a minute, though.
- You right.

453
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,917
Hell, she give free head?
Or does she charge like Paula?

454
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,468
Hell, Paula getting cheap, though.

455
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,046
Talkin' like a rock
can get your rock sucked!

456
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,757
- Nigga, what was that?!
- Yo, what you doin', man?

457
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,092
Get off me, dawg.

458
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,768
Now I ain't with that gay shit,

459
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,530
but if you fuck with me, I'll give
your ass more than you can handle,

460
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,352

your crackhead-ass mama.

461
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,683
My nigga!

462
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,485
- Fuck y'all niggas!
- What'd you say?! Huh?

463
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,733
Say that shit again, dog, I swear.

464
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,817
Whatever, man.

465
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,246
A'ight, you better stay your ass right
there if you know what's good for you.

466
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,200
Yo, why your jeans so tight?

467
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,926
Yo, Pizzo, you see these nigga's jeans be?

468
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,887
I see them shits.
- Nigga nuts must be chokin'

469
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,209

470
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,632
- Real talk!
- A'ight, night, Little.

471
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,004
See your ass later.

472
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:59,229
<i>Metrorail closing in 15 minutes.</i>

473
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,277
You was waitin' for me?

474
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:49,115
Well, nice to see you too.

475
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:50,663
What you doing out here, man?

476
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,325
Nigga, what you doing out here?

477
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,831
This is my smoker habitat,
nigga.

478
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,294
Oh, what, you smoke out here too?

479
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,592
Something like that.

480
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,420
Tsk... nah, you don't smoke.

481
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:07,972
Why you pretending?

482
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,509
Trying to put on a show
for me, Black?

483
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,555
Why you always calling me that?

484
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,398
- What, Black?
- Yeah, Black.

485
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,606
That's my nickname for you.
You don't like it?

486
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,065
No, it's just...

487
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:29,277
What kind of dude goes around
giving other dudes nicknames?

488
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,946
The kind of dude
what just sat down

489
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,498
and is about to put you
onto this blunt, nigga.

490
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,920
Yeah. You like the water?

491
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,167
Well, I can introduce you
to some "fiyah."

492
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,906
Tsk, come on, nigga.
It ain't gonna bite you.

493
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,762
Oh, man...

494
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,516
Damn, I didn't know
you smoked like that.

495
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,442
My moms leaves
all types of shit around.

496
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,459
That breeze
feel good <i>as</i> hell man.

497
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,712
Yeah, it do.

498
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:14,428
Sometimes round the way, where we live,
you can catch that same breeze.

499
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,014
It just come through the hood

500
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,187
and it's like everything stop
for a second...

501
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,853
'cause everyone just wanna feel it.

502
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,147
Everything just gets quiet,
you know?

503
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,072
And it's like all you can hear
is your own heartbeat.

504
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,443
Right?

505
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,574
Yeah...

506
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,080
Feel so good, man.

507
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,703
So good...

508
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,751
Hell, shit make you wanna cry,
feel so good.

509
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:51,461
You cry?

510
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,471
Nah.

511
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,057
Makes me want to.

512
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,813
What you cry about?

513
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:11,148
Shit, I cry so much, sometimes I feel like
Imma just turn into drops.

514
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,199
You just roll out into the water, right?

515
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,592
Roll out into the water like all these
other motherfuckers around here

516
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,209
trying to drown they sorrows.

517
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:27,914
Why you say that?

518
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,882
I'm just listening to you, nigga.

519
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,004
Sound like something
you wanna do.

520
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,100
I wanna do a lot of things
that don't make sense.

521
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,685
I didn't say
it don't make sense.

522
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:54,107
But tell me, like... like what?

523
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,941
Like what "lot of things"?

524
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,535
Damn, dog!

525
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,204
You nosey.

526
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,867
Chiron cursing now, huh?

527
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,637
- You trying to get smart with me?
- Whatever, man.

528
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,165
Nah, you trying to get smart
with me, huh, Chiron?

529
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,876
Yeah, you trying to get smart
with me, huh?

530
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,090
I'm sorry...

531
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,011
What you gotta be sorry for?

532
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,686
You ain't never done nothing
like that before, huh?

533
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,909
Thanks for the ride, man.

534
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,908
No problem, Black.

535
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,288
I'll see you around.

536
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,169
Yeah...

537
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,463
See you around.

538
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,847
Come here, baby.

539
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:57,892
Come here.

540
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:03,155
You don't love me no more...

541
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,782
Hmm?

542
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,157
You don't love me no more...

543
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,283
You're my only.

544
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,836
I'm your only.

545
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,338
You're my only...

546
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,366
- Yo, what's up, Kev?
- Terrel, what's up man?

547
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,879
Hey, you know a nigga
don't see school no more.

548
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,450
Yo, I hear you, man.

549
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,167
Now the lunch used to be
the shit, though.

550
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,495
Nah, the food
wasn't never good.

551
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,546
Man, I ain't talkin'
'bout the food.

552
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,670
But that Friday pizza
was the shit.

553
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,047
Yeah, I feel you, a'ight.

554
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:10,131
Nah, but you remember in middle school,
that game we used to play?

555
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,181
"Knock down/stay down"?

556
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,102
Yeah, yo, my crazy ass
was the king of that shit.

557
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,350
Yeah, I remember. Yo!

558
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,227
You remember that white kid
you fucked up?

559
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,059
Cuban cat, right?
Mauricio or something?

560
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,770
Oh, yeah! Yo, you fucked
that kid's face up!

561
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:27,606
We was calling you Tyson
after that shit.

562
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,657
Yeah.

563
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,406
Yo, but, uh...

564
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,533
niggas don't do that shit no more.

565
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,990
I mean... you know...

566
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,915
What you sayin'?

567
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:44,294
I'm sayin' is,
if I point a nigga out...

568
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,420
is you gonna
knock his ass down?

569
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,715
That's the game, ain't it?

570
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,267
You dare me to swing on him
and if I do, it's on you.

571
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,936
A'ight. A'ight, Kev.

572
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,972
Let me see who ass
gettin' dropped today.

573
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:05,524
Don't be drinking none
of this gummy juice. Shit'll kill you.

574
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,278
Yo, Kev.

575
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,741
Hit that nigga.

576
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,661
Hit that nigga, Kev.

577
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,495
Yeah, hit his faggot ass!

578
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,667
- The fuck you waitin' on?
- Do it! Come on.

579
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,178
Let's go.

580
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:20,351
How you like that, Chiron?

581
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,685
Yo, I think
he want another one.

582
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,642
- Another one. Do it.
- Give it to him.

583
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,865
- Don't you get up, bruh.
- You stay down!

584
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,489
Yeah, if he get up,
knock his faggot ass back down.

585
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:39,162
- Chiron, stay down!
- He got up.

586
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:43,158
- Come on, man.
- Stay down.

587
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,663
Do it again.

588
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,209
- Do it!
- Do it! Move!

589
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,073
<i>Listen, son...</i>

590
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:24,416
If you don't press charges,

591
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:28,541
I can't stop this from happening.
Understand?

592
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,168
You don't even know.

593
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,879
- Oh, I don't?
- Nuh-uh.

594
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,677
You think all this just started, boy?

595
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,305
- I ain't no boy.
- The hell you ain't.

596
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,220
If you were a man,

597
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,523
there'd be four other knuckleheads
sittin' right next to you.

598
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,275
You don't even know.

599
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,199
Listen, son, listen.

600
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,781
Listen.

601
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:07,458
I'm not blaming you... I'm not.

602
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,747
<i>I know it's hard.</i>

603
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,377
<i>Believe me.</i>

604
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,802
<i>I'm not trying to disrespect
your struggle.</i>

605
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,216
<i>I just need you to know...</i>

606
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,981
All right, all right.
Stay focused.

607
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,236
Hey... Hey, Chiron!

608
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,665
Get the fuck off me, nigga!

609
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,051
Get the fuck off me!

610
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,318
Don't look at me!

611
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:37,262
- Hello, homie.
- Yo, what's good with you, B?

612
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,474
Vibing, vibing?

613
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,730
- What's good?
- You vibin'?

614
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,777
- I'm trying to.
- Trying to?

615
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,445
So where the hos at?

616
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,293
Nigga, you smiling and shit like you don't
know what the fuck I'm talking about.

617
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,739
Where the hos at, nigga?

618
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,197
I don't know. You tell me.

619
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,924
There's this bitch that stay
down the corner.

620
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,666
What's her name?

621
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,584
- Afrodesia.
- You making it up.

622
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,333
I don't believe you.

623
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,961
I ain't never seen you with no bitch,
I don't believe you.

624
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,963
- Her name Afrodesia.
- Her name Afrodesia? Where she at?

625
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,510
- She only come out at night.
- Okay.

626
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,554
- Yeah.
- Okay.

627
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,934
You short, Travis.

628
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:09,237
- Wait, what?
- Where the rest of the roll?

629
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,564
It's all there.

630
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,793
I mean, you might could think I'm trouble,
when I handed it to you it was all there.

631
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:19,038
It's a'ight. If it's all there,
then count that shit then, Trav.

632
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,075
Count it, if it's all there.

633
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,136
Move, you're in my spot.

634
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,641
Move.

635
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,104
Give me my fucking money, man.

636
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,400
You sayin' I'm a liar?

637
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,947
All right.

638
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,444
I ain't say that.

639
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,543
I told you to count what's off
and you said it wasn't.

640
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,820
That's you calling me a liar.

641
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,746
Nah, all I did was tell you that...

642
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:02,665
You... you did what?

643
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,834
Nah, I'm just fucking with you.

644
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,629
Huh?

645
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:18,965
Count good.

646
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,474
Did real good. Here.

647
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:29,076
Can't be on the corner if you can't take
a nigga just fuckin' with you,

648
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,728
- you feel me?
- Yeah.

649
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:01,429
<i>Chiron, this your mama.</i>

650
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:06,058
<i>I know it's late, but I...</i>

651
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:10,392
<i>I figured you ain't never
been one much for sleep.</i>

652
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:13,354
<i>Atlanta ain't but so big.</i>

653
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:16,531
<i>It seems to me you come see
your mama from time to time.</i>

654
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,573
<i>Hope you gettin' some rest, baby.</i>

655
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,077
<i>Hope you come by soon.</i>

656
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:47,805
Ma, it's late.
I'll be there tomorrow, I promise.

657
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,432
<i>Hello?</i>

658
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:56,772
<i>Hey, Black...
I mean, uh, Chiron.</i>

659
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:01,780
<i>What's up, man?
This, uh... this Kevin.</i>

660
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,411
<i>You there?</i>

661
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,584
Yeah.

662
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,753
<i>Long time, no see, right?</i>

663
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,877
<i>Man, I had to ask Teresa
for your number, and...</i>

664
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:22,255
Hold up, man. You...
you do remember me, right?

665
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,769
Yeah, I do.

666
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,314
Been a while.

667
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:33,892
Yeah. Yeah, it has, man.

668
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:38,237
So, uh, where you at now, man?

669
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:43,280
Georgia. Atlanta.

670
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:49,624
- I've been up here ever since...
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, man, that's what I heard.</i>

671
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,201
Yeah.

672
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:04,131
<i>Hey, man, I'm sorry
about all that...</i>

673
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:08,263
<i>All that... shit.
What went down... Chiron.</i>

674
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,310
<i>Real shit, dawg, I am.</i>

675
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,198
So, uh...

676
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,951
what you doin' up there, man?

677
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,742
<i>Not much. Just...</i>

678
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,082
<i>just trouble.</i>

679
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:35,666
Chiron and trouble
always found a way.

680
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,585
Yeah... somethin' like that.

681
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,593
- What about you?
<i>- Me?</i>

682
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,433
I'm a cook, man.

683
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,393
<i>Y... y... you a cook?</i>

684
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,145
Yeah, buddy.

685
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:59,360
Man, I got sent up for some stupid shit,

686
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,984
the same stupid shit
we always get sent up for.

687
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:06,113
They put me on the kitchen line, man,
and... kinda took to it.

688
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:11,281
<i>Anyway, man, I just...
I just thought about you, man, I...</i>

689
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:15,710
<i>We got this jukebox in here and, uh...
folks come by and play they songs,</i>

690
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,753
<i>that's the music we get in here,
and it's...</i>

691
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,707
This dude, man...

692
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,674
Just reminded me of you.

693
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,216
<i>So, uh...</i>

694
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,059
<i>Hey, man, if you ever come to town, man,
you come holla at me.</i>

695
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,432
I'll cook you somethin'.

696
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:42,187
Maybe...
Maybe play that song for you.

697
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:47,150
<i>All right, man, um...
You be easy, all right?</i>

698
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,105
How you been?

699
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:45,193
I'm all right.
I ain't sleepin'.

700
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,610
Why not?

701
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,190
- Right. If you knew, you'd...
- Bad dreamin'.

702
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,740
Still?

703
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,113
You ever thought about talking
about it with somebody?

704
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:03,377
Maybe not even a counselor,
maybe somebody like your mama?

705
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:08,799
Yeah...

706
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,423
Yeah, it sound funny to me too.

707
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,974
You talk to Teresa?

708
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:20,427
- Yeah.
- Mm.

709
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,888
How she doing?

710
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,648
Good.

711
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,270
"Good."

712
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,940
When you go home, Ma?

713
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,534
Home?

714
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,205
This is home. You know...

715
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:43,785
I mean, they allowing me to stay and work
as long as I like. I figure...

716
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:47,330
Might as well help other folks.

717
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,332
Keep myself out of trouble.

718
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,048
- That's good, Mama.
- Yeah.

719
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:02,053
Yeah, I think it is too.
I really do.

720
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,185
So, you still in them streets?

721
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,566
Didn't come all the way
the hell to Georgia

722
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,335
to have you fallin'
in the same shit, Chiron.

723
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,078
- Imma go. Imma go...
- No, no, no, no, you gon' listen!

724
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:22,452
To who, Ma? Huh?

725
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,284
To you?
Really, though?

726
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:28,913
Please...

727
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,464
please.

728
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:44,141
I messed up.

729
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,642
I fucked it all the way up.

730
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,150
I know that.

731
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:58,276
But yo' heart ain't gotta be black
like mine, baby.

732
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,208
I love you, Chiron.

733
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:09,579
I do.

734
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,424
I love you, baby.

735
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:18,679
I mean, you ain't gotta love me.

736
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:23,134
Lord knows I did not have love for you
when you needed it, I know that.

737
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,937
So you ain't gotta love me.

738
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:31,143
But you gon' know that I love you.

739
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,529
You hear?

740
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,908
You hear me, Chiron?

741
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,621
I hear you, Mama.

742
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:58,761
Here.

743
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,497
I'm sorry, baby.

744
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,256
I'm so sorry.

745
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,890
Come here, Mama.

746
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,178
Be right with you.

747
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,286
How y'all doin'?

748
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,293
Good? All right.
I'll take these.

749
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,317
I'll be right back
with your check.

750
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:13,508
Be right with you, boss,
just let me get this out the way.

751
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,157
All right...

752
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:34,486
All right, man,

753
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:35,913

01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:38,999
<i>Chiron?</i>

755
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:45,126
Damn man,

756
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,811
'Sup, Kev?

757
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:04,483
Damn, man, what...
What you doing down here?

758
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:06,185
I mean...

759
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:09,108
Hey! hey...

760
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,574
You here now, man,
that's all that matter.

761
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,700
There you go

762
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,749
You ain't... you ain't changed
one damn bit.

763
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:24,624
You still can't say more than three words
at a time, huh?

764
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,832
Said you was gon' cook for me.
I know how to say that.

765
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,299
Yeah, I did say that, didn't I?

766
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,550
Don't look like your ass
been missing no meals.

767
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,928
Yeah.

768
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,725
But I got you, man.
Sit down.

769
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,518
Sit down, man.
What you want?

770
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:45,103
You can order off the menu
if you want to, or...

771
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:49,028
Hey... I could just hit you
with that chef's special.

772
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,077
Yeah.

773
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,661

01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,498
One chef's special...

775
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,524
Chef's special.

776
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:20,068
Oh, so you Cuban now?

777
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:22,029
Only in the kitchen, <i>papi.</i>

778
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,994
Yo, sit down, man,

779
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:36,127
You want a drink?

01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,927
Nah, I don't drink.

781
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:04,034
Nigga, I ain't seen you in like a decade.

782
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,035
You gon' drink with me.

783
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,711
Boom.

784
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,805
Nah, bruh, nah, bruh...

785
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:25,929
Welcome back, bruh.

786
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,821
Damn, brother, I thought
you said you didn't drink.

787
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,153
Can't really taste it,
so I don't mess with it.

788
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,542
- I saw that. I saw that.
- What? What?

789
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,945
You don't wanna waste none of that,
do you? It tastes good.

790
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:03,505
Chill out, man.
It's straight, bruh.

791
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:04,840
- Say what?
- It's straight.

792
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,175
"It's straight."

793
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,681
Man, please, it's better
than Chef Boyardee, ain't it?

794
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,604
Chill out, bruh.
My Spaghetti-O's go hard, man.

795
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:17,319
Hey, eat your dinner, man.

796
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:20,902
Eat your dinner.

797
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:27,158
Got it, Mr. George?
I'll be back.

798
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:55,808
Hey, man, you...

799
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,355
Fine-ass Samantha.

800
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,821
Yeah, I remember her.

801
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,490
Yeah?

802
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:05,158
Check this out.

803
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,455
Kevin Jr.

804
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:18,039
Me and Samantha, man.

805
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:22,046
We had him young. Shit, too young.

806
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,923
Man, when I got locked up,
man, that shit was hard.

807
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:32,178
Wasn't no way I could go back the streets,
man. Not after this.

808
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,314
- Y'all still down?
- Me and Sam?

809
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:40,519
Nah. I mean, we...

810
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:44,197
We gotta be, you know,
'cause of li'l man, but...

811
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,274
Nah, not like that, man.

812
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,074
But what about you, bruh?

813
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,624
What about me?

814
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:57,669
Nigga... tell me somethin'.

815
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,292
I mean, what you doin'?

816
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:02,836
Who you doin'?

817
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:08,889
Man, come on now. I've been back there
in that kitchen, man,

818
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:10,807
and cooked for your ass
and everything, man.

819
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:14,807
Hey, these grandma rules, man.
You know the deal.

820
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,560
Your ass eat, your ass speak.

821
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:26,231
All right... straight up?

822
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:27,907
Yeah, nigga, straight up.

823
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:32,279
I'm trappin'.

824
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:39,040
- What?
- Yeah.

825
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:42,251
When they sent me to Atlanta,

826
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:45,334
put me straight into juvie
for beatin' the old boy.

827
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,215
Met this dude in there.

828
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:50,839
When I come out,
he put me on the block.

829
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,016
Did good at it and rose up.

830
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:56,511
It is what it is.

831
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:00,815
Bullshit, man.

832
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:03,519
That ain't what it is.

833
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,897
That ain't you, Chiron.

834
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,655
Nigga, you don't know me.

835
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,703
I don't know you?

836
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,183
There you are.

837
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:42,187
Twenty-four fifty.
Want the change?

838
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:44,560
- All right.
- Bye.

839
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:08,842
Why you got
them damn fronts, man?

840
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:00,223
Why'd you call me?

841
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:02,558
What?

842
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:06,687
Why did you call me?

843
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:12,822
I told you, man.

844
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:15,696
- Dude came in...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

845
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:25,627
He played this song, man...

846
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:41,054
This you?

847
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,223
You wasn't playin'
'bout them traps, huh?

848
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:05,953
Ride dirty, huh?

849
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:08,574
Something like that.

850
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:16,915
<i>So, how you be gettin' to work?</i>

851
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:20,965
Bus. Jitney.

852
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:25,340
Sometimes Samantha shoot me out there
when I got Li'l Kev.

853
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:31,104
I can't picture bein' in Miami
with no car.

854
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:34,479
- Man, it's real out here.
- Yeah, I bet.

855
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:39,688
Real hot, real slow,
and real busted.

856
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:42,149
Shot me like a duck out here, man.

857
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:44,825
This nigga said "a duck."

858
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:47,950
- Yeah, you on one. You on one.
- You know what I'm doin'.

859
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:50,123
Nah, I'm just tired, bruh.

860
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:53,956
Hey, man, bet on the ride, though.

861
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:56,083
- Yeah.
- Appreciate it.

862
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:57,960
Yeah, man.

863
01:37:58,039 --> 01:37:59,791
Can't have yo ass on no Jitney.

864
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:08,216
So, Chiron...

865
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:15,186
What... what you looking at me
like that for?

866
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:18,188
What, man? Come on,
you just drove down here?

867
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:23,736
Yeah.

868
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:30,368
Like you was just... you was just on one...
and you hit the highway?

869
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:36,419

01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:46,781

872
01:39:51,444 --> 01:39:54,118
- This the spot.

873
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:06,126
Come on in.
Get yourself at home.

874
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:17,972

877
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,793
Man, you a lightweight.

878
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:45,169
Nah, you was pouring that mug.
You was pouring it.

879
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:47,501
- "I can't taste this".
- Chill out, man.

880
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:48,880
We had like three bottles.

881
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:52,134
Yeah, three bottles. I'll make you
some green tea, man, come on.

882
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:54,011
I won't be drinking
that shit either, man.

883
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:56,434
- What do you drink?
- Water.

884
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:28,132

885
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:31,256

886
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:32,837
Yeah, nigga. You.

887
01:41:33,879 --> 01:41:37,224
I'm saying, man, them fronts.
That car.

888
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:39,890
Who is you, Chiron?

889
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:45,441
I'm me, man.
I ain't tryin' to be nothin' else.

890
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:48,315
Oh, okay.
So you hard now?

891
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:50,775
I ain't say that.

892
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:52,107
Well, then what?

893
01:41:55,610 --> 01:42:00,207
Hey, hey, hey, I ain't tryin'
to hem you up, man, it's just...

894
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:02,124
I ain't seen you in a minute and...

895
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:05,124
It's not what I expected.

896
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,256
Well, what did you expect?

897
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:19,342
You remember...

898
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:23,645
You remember the last time
I saw you?

899
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,488
For a long time,
tried not to remember.

900
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:36,196
Tried to forget all those times.

901
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:42,661
Yeah.

902
01:42:44,325 --> 01:42:48,375
When we got to Atlanta...
I started over.

903
01:42:49,372 --> 01:42:53,502
Built myself from the ground up.
Built myself hard.

904
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:01,388
What about you? You...

905
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:02,719
Me?

906
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:09,646
I wasn't never really worth shit.

907
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,562
Just kept on, man.

908
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:19,323
Never really did anything
I actually wanted to do.

909
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:23,865
It was all I could do was to do what folks
thought I should be doing.

910
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:26,708
I wasn't never really myself.

911
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:31,081
And now?

912
01:43:31,163 --> 01:43:32,540
Now?

913
01:43:35,418 --> 01:43:37,637
Now, man...

914
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:40,056
Now I got li'l Kev.

915
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:41,633
Got this job.

916
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,761
Another 18 months of probation.

917
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,729
That's some real shit, man.

918
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:52,276
Nah, man, it's a life.
You know?

919
01:43:53,269 --> 01:43:57,274
I ain't never had that before.
Like...

920
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:00,067
Like, I'm tired as hell right now, man,

921
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:03,075
and I ain't making no more
than shoe money, but...

922
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,661
I ain't got no worries, man.

923
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:09,290
Not them kind
what I had before.

924
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:12,171
That's that real shit.

925
01:44:13,622 --> 01:44:15,750
That's that Bob Marley shit, nigga.

926
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:36,153
You the only man
that's ever touched me.

927
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:46,656
You're the only one.

928
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:55,586
I haven't really
touched anyone since.
