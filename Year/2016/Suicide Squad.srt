1
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:39,986
Chow time!

2
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:41,116
It's time!

3
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:43,870
Floyd, step up to the door.
Dinner time.

4
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:50,158
Only my friends call me Floyd.

5
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,472
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

6
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:55,070
What's that?

7
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,339
That is called loaf.

8
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:56,961
A loaf!

9
00:00:57,373 --> 00:00:59,386
It's got a little bit of pasghetti in there.

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,971
Toenails.

11
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,633
Rat shit.

12
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:04,695
Everything a growing fella needs, like you.

13
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:09,343
- Come hear. Can I tell you something?
Can I tell a secret? - Yeah

14
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:11,324
One day ...

15
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:14,206
Somehow, Someway,
I'm gonna get outta here.

16
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:18,942
And I'm gonna rain down on you,
like the Holy Ghost.

17
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:22,662
Man, you just threatened a staff number.

18
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:23,575
Yeah?

19
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:24,926
Yeah, you have.

20
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:26,036
Do something.

21
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,293
Let's have some fun.

22
00:01:57,096 --> 00:01:58,651
Open a goddamn gate!

23
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:00,677
Come on guys. Don't waste my time.

24
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,453
Sector C! Pat attention!
Boss is on deck!

25
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:08,714
Open!

26
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:11,312
Bravo 14, Open perimeter fence.
Stay Back!

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,844
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

28
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:17,349
You gonna come down from there or what?

29
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:21,786
Look at you.

30
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,140
You know the rules, hotness.

31
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,715
You gotta keep off these bars.

32
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,556
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

33
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:32,885
Oh, my good.

34
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,292
You are really in bad shape upstairs, lady!

35
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:39,198
Can you come in here and tell me that?

36
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:41,726
Or are you too scared?

37
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,708
Come on, I'm bored.

38
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,560
I'm bored, play with me.

39
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:47,559
You put five of my guards in the hospital, honey.

40
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:49,580
No one's gonna play with you.

41
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:51,445
You sleep on the ground.

42
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:55,520
I sleep where I want, when I want, with who I want.

43
00:02:57,521 --> 00:02:58,922
Oh man. I love you.

44
00:02:58,923 --> 00:02:59,994
Alpha one ...

45
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:01,208
hit her<.i>

46
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:06,269
Come on man. You're 66 foot four.
She's a tiny little girl.

47
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:09,582
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

48
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:12,060
We got chocolate, strawberry or vanilla.

49
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,536
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

50
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,646
Spring break!

51
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:27,349
That is just a whole lot of pretty in a whole lot of crazy.

52
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:51,322
The world changed when Superman
flew across the sky.<.i>

53
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:54,301
And it changed again when he didn't.

54
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,518
Remember.

55
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,615
And that is why I'm here.<.i>

00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,014
Hello Amanda.

58
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,776
We lose a national hero ...

59
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,907
but you sit there looking like the cat that ate the canary.

60
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:35,436
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

61
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:37,621
It's taken some work.

62
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:41,086
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

63
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:44,539
There's rumors, Amanda ...

64
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,232
Some of them have abilities.

65
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,873
The rumors are right.

66
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,075
You know what a problem with a metahuman is?

67
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,429
The human part.

68
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,399
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.

69
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,376
The next Superman might not.

70
00:04:58,774 --> 00:04:59,998
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

71
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:01,960
I'm fighting fire with fire.

72
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:06,267
You are not going to pitch us that Task
Force X project of yours again, are you?

73
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:07,678
Yes

74
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,704
But this time, you're gonna listen.

75
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:14,807
Floyd Lawton, AKA Deadshot.

76
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,556
He is the most wanted hitman in the world.<.i>

77
00:05:37,307 --> 00:05:40,565
Let's say he has an elite clientele.

78
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,587
- What?
- Hey Angelo.

79
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:46,942
This is the exterminator you called for your rat problem.

80
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:49,331
My account's looking a little thin.

81
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:52,508
No one gets paid until what needs to get done,
gets done.<.i>

82
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:54,998
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, No honey.

83
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:59,247
Wow! Here is your boy right now.

84
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,217
With about 20 of his new best friends.

85
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:08,580
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

86
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:11,178
Listen. Stop being cute and do your job!

87
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,793
They're taking him outta the car now.

88
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:17,044
In about 30 seconds,
your window is gonna close forever.

89
00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:19,312
Okay, Okay, Okay. Relax.

90
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,880
There was an accounting error.

91
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:22,041
We sent it.

92
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:25,600
Now double it for being an dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.

93
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,586
- We're not the kind of people you play with.
- Did you threaten me?

94
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,257
This dude's gonna get a sore throat.
From all the singing he's about to do.

95
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:34,450
You son of a bitch.

96
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,039
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

97
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,103
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

98
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:04,428
His is an 11- year- old honor student in Gotham city.
His daughter.

99
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:06,887
So we watched her and waited.

100
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,714
You should talk to Mama more.

101
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:10,787
Yeah, yeah. I know

102
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:12,767
Mama stays in bed a lot.

103
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,089
Yeah. She's still going out at night?

104
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:18,177
Dad, it's okay, I can take care of her.

105
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:21,549
I know how to make pancakes now.

106
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:23,348
Hey babe, That's beautiful.

107
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,295
She's supposed to be taking care of you.
That's how that's supposed to work.

108
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,471
I want you to come and live with me.

109
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,979
All right? I came into some resources.
I'mma get us spot.

110
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,251
It's gonna be nice, all right?

111
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:41,534
Mama says I can't live with you because you kill people.

112
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:44,863
That's not true, That's a lie. She is lying to you.

113
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:46,195
Daddy ...

114
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:48,385
I know you do bad things.

115
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:51,458
Don't worry. I still love you.

116
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:56,003
Come on.

117
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:57,869
And you caught him?

118
00:07:57,987 --> 00:07:59,040
Not me.

119
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:02,249
I just gave an anonymous tip
the right guy in the Gotham city.

120
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,020
I'mma figure this out.

121
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,922
All right?

122
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:11,486
It's over, Headshot.

123
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:14,590
I do not want to do this
in front of your daughter.

124
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:26,157
- Daddy, please.
- Zoe, move!

125
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,022
Please daddy. Don't do it.

126
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:32,152
Please.

127
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:35,919
Don't do it.

128
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:47,237
All right.

129
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:57,017
Love you, daddy.

130
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,820
So now we have the man who never misses.

131
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,060
Where'd you put him?

132
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,091
Let's just say.
I put him in a hole and threw away the hole.

133
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,392
Harley Quinn.

134
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:17,439
Before she ran off and joined the circus ...

135
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,276
She was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.<.i>

136
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:22,631
A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.<.i>

137
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,533
She was assigned to The Clown himself.

138
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,307
Dr. Quinzel.

139
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,108
You know, I lived for these moments with you.

140
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:33,717
What do you get?

141
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,042
I got you a kitty.

142
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:37,097
So thoughtful.

143
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,857
She thought she was curing him ...<.i>

144
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,090
But, She was falling in love.<.i>

145
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,416
There is something you could do
for me ...

146
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,433
Doctor

147
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:46,777
Anything. I mean, yeah.

148
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:50,897
I need a machine gun.

149
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:53,397
A Machine gun?

150
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,196
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

151
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:11,511
Get off me!

152
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,599
What do we have here?

153
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:21,419
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me Mr.J?

154
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:22,551
What?

155
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,479
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya

156
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,172
I'm just gonna hurt ya ...

157
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:33,955
really, really bad.

158
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:35,847
You think so?

159
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,248
Well, I can take it.

160
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:48,775
They became the king and the queen of Gotham city.<.i>

161
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,236
And god help anyone who disrespected the queen.

162
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,626
- We finally meet.
- He ain't shake hands.

163
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,775
But sit down and have a drink.

164
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,315
Hey, J.

165
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,662
On behalf of everybody, welcome back.

166
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:09,483
I wanted to come by and
personally say thank you.

167
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,470
You're making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

168
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,930
Are you sweet talkin' me?

169
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:19,958
I love this guy.

170
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,411
He's so intense!

171
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:30,337
You're lucky man.

172
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:32,730
You got a bad bitch.

173
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,433
Oh, that she is.

174
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:40,167
The fire in my loins.

175
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,309
The itch in my pants.

176
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,704
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

177
00:11:58,203 --> 00:12:01,196
Oh, come to Daddy.

178
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,070
Puddin"!

179
00:12:04,452 --> 00:12:09,993
Listen! You are my gift to this handsome hunka hunka!

180
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:13,347
You belong to him now.

181
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,061
You're cute!

182
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:21,303
You want me?

183
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:24,657
I'm all yours.

184
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,854
I don't want no beef.

185
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,150
You don't want no beef?
You don't want ..

186
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:32,598
Why, what's wrong? (Dont't wanna beef?)
You don't like me?

187
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:34,412
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

188
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:35,740
This is your lady.

189
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:39,863
Look, are you enjoying yourself?

190
00:12:40,714 --> 00:12:41,790
No.

191
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,799
- That's your lady, Joker!
- That's right!

192
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:46,137
You, J!

193
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,675
And, That was just the beginning.<.i>

194
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,542
Come on, Puddin". Do it!

195
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:04,618
Oh ...

196
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:09,478
- We have got company.
- Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

197
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,380
She is crazier than him.<.i>

198
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:15,157
And more fearless.<.i>

199
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,707
Stupid Bat, You're ruining date night!

200
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,223
Puddin".

201
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:27,967
Puddin", I can't swimmmmm!

202
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,783
And the Bat got her, too.<.i>

203
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:09,038
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.<.i>

204
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,500
And then there's the Aussie.

205
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:26,086
Digger Harkness.

206
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:30,011
Or as the tabloids call him: Capitan Boomerang.<.i>

207
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:39,887
We're gonna be rich.

208
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,401
Yeah, you and me, mate.
Go and get the car.

209
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:46,269
He robbed every bank in Australia.at least once.<.i>

210
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:49,228
Then he came to America for a fresh target set.

211
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:53,332
Doesn't work well with others.

212
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,251
No honor among thieves, ha?

213
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:05,345
But he tangled with a metahuman and,
lived to tell about it.

214
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:09,070
And have you heard of the pyro kinetic homeboy?

215
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,104
How'd you catch him?

216
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:17,357
We did not. He surrendered.

217
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:21,927
Chato Santana. On the street they call him El Diablo.

218
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:24,879
This LA gangbanger thought
he was the king of the world ...<.i>

219
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:27,545
until he lost his queen.<.i>

220
00:15:29,315 --> 00:15:33,050
Gets jumped in prison riot and
incinerates half the yard.

221
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,345
The security video is incredible.

222
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:39,573
Oh, Jesus.

223
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:43,724
- What the hell is that?
- His name is Waylon Jones.

224
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,118
KC, dinner.

225
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:47,749
Open it up, B.

226
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:51,060
Evolution took a step backwards with this one.<.i>

227
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:53,402
Give me that, Smitty.

228
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:55,584
Where you at?

229
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:59,010
They call him Killer Croc.<.i>

230
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:03,092
He looked like a monster.<.i>

231
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,600
So they treated him like a monster.<.i>

232
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,183
Then he became a monster.<.i>

233
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,256
He was chased out of Gotham by the bat.

234
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:15,996
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

235
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:17,688
He never found it.

236
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,994
I saved the best for last.

237
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,358
- The witch.
- A witch?

238
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:33,781
I'm talking a flying, spell- casting,
making- shit- disappear witch.

239
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:36,963
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

240
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:41,518
Archaeologist doctor June Moone ...<.i>

241
00:16:42,762 --> 00:16:44,956
Wondered into the wrong cave.

242
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:55,730
June ...

243
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:00,841
She opened something she shouldn't have ...<.i>

244
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:15,616
releasing a metahuman more powerful
than any we've encountered.

245
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:18,204
The Enchantress.

246
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,751
She inhabits Dr.Moone's body now.<.i>

247
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,021
Where is this witch?

248
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:29,687
In my pocket.

249
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,086
Now tell him why she won't turn you into a frog.

250
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:34,833
Some say the witch has
a secret buried heart ...

251
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:37,517
and whoever finds it, can control the witch.<.i>

252
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,568
So we searched the cave where she turned up ...<.i>

253
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:41,334
and we found her heart.<.i>

254
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:46,166
That thing's her heart?

255
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,691
She is vulnerable without it.

256
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:51,102
You want to put our national security in the hands of ...

257
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:54,496
witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?

258
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:57,339
- Don't forget about the Joker's girlfriend.
- These are villains Amanda.

259
00:17:57,574 --> 00:17:59,423
What makes you think you can control them?

260
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:02,702
Because getting people to act
against their own self- interests ...

261
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,398
for the national security of the
U.S is what I do for a living.

262
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:10,736
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced ...

263
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:12,240
Colonel Rick Flag.<.i>

264
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,958
Help me.

265
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:40,498
I assigned him to watch Dr.Moone,
and just as I hoped ...<.i>

266
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:42,293
it got personal.<.i>

267
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,350
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

268
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:45,987
I have the witch's heart.

269
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:48,110
And Dr.Moone has his.

270
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:52,344
Now he'll follow my orders as Holy Writ.

271
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:57,395
In a world of flying men and monsters ...

272
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,263
this is the only way to protect our country.

273
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:09,747
What if Superman had decided to fly down,
rip off the roof of the White House ...

274
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:12,869
and grab the president of the US
right out of the Overall office?

275
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,936
Who would've stopped him?

276
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,329
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea ...

277
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:21,813
anthrax in our mail. We got fluoride in our water.

278
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,913
But what happens if
the next Superman ...

279
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:27,009
becomes a terrorist?

280
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,990
Amanda Waller has a plan.
Amanda?

281
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:33,936
I want to build a team of some very bad people
who I think can do some good.

282
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,658
Like fight a next war,
defeat the next Superman.

283
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,206
Not on my watch.

284
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:41,839
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

285
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:45,887
General, we run them covertly non- attributed.
Strictly need to know.

286
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:48,687
And if they get caught,
we throw them under [?]

287
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:53,228
The next war will be fought
with these meta humans. Ours or Theirs.

288
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:55,809
We're not the only ones kicking
up rocks looking for them.

289
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,107
You know we can't control these people.

290
00:20:04,184 --> 00:20:06,127
June, Be strong!

291
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,706
Dr.Moone.

292
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:34,629
Enchantress

293
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,850
Meet the Enchantress.

294
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:54,110
Everything we know about her,
is in your briefing packs.

295
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,962
She's walked this earth
for a very long time ...

296
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,407
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

297
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:02,108
This meeting is ... is now a magic show?

298
00:21:02,356 --> 00:21:05,373
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

299
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,680
Go get it, girl.

300
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,302
How about a little something from
the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

301
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:41,577
We've been chasing these plans for years.

302
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,847
Please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

303
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:48,021
Thank you. We'd like Dr.Moone back.

304
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:50,047
Enchantress.

305
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:02,137
Please, Please.

306
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:04,659
I'm sorry. I can' ... I can't do that again.
I can' ...

307
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,346
Flag, get her out of here.

308
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:10,111
I move to ...

309
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:15,894
authorize Amanda Waller to establish
"Task Force X" under the Argus program.

310
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:19,166
All right.

311
00:22:19,531 --> 00:22:21,809
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

312
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:36,243
Welcome to Belle Reve, special security barracks.
How you doing man?

313
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:38,377
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She is in charge.

314
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,486
Welcome, ma'am.
How are you?

315
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,665
I'm here to assist you in anyway.

316
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:44,551
Where are they?

317
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:04,548
Are you the Devil?

318
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,729
Maybe.

319
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:39,816
Ain't you scared?

320
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,110
Why'd they put you down here?

321
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,427
I asked.

322
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,271
You. Ese<.i>

323
00:23:56,398 --> 00:23:58,297
Hola, amigo.<.i>

324
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:02,159
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

325
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:15,605
What's up? Hey, you want some of this?<.i>

326
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,063
Then come down here.

327
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:19,413
That ain't me.

328
00:24:19,514 --> 00:24:20,515
That wasn't you?

329
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,496
Nah, they say it's me, but that ain't me.

330
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:23,824
That guy's gone.

331
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:25,324
He's dead.

332
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,856
And yet, here you are.

333
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:27,514
Ma'am.

334
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:28,987
Let me try to talk to him.

335
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:35,930
You wanna die in here buddy?

336
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,713
You got a real shot at
walking at the block again.

337
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,664
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.

338
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:42,988
A Women.

339
00:24:43,111 --> 00:24:44,199
Look, man ...

340
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,026
You ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

341
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:48,561
Ask what?

342
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,339
I'm a man. Okay?

343
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,574
I ain't no weapon.

344
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,726
I'mmna die in peace before
I raise my fists again.

345
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,047
I've caused enough harm.

346
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,475
All right, unlock him.

347
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:10,717
What?

348
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,899
You heard me.

349
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,183
You know what this man can do?

350
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,553
I'm here to find out.
Lose the restraints.

351
00:25:21,368 --> 00:25:22,805
OK.

352
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:25,070
What is this?

353
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:27,107
Cheerleading tryouts?

354
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:29,205
Let's go. Let's see what you can do.

355
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:31,215
They say you never missed a shot.

356
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:32,586
Prove it.

357
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:47,208
Now you got one in the chamber.

358
00:25:47,454 --> 00:25:48,991
What you gonna do with it?

359
00:25:50,224 --> 00:25:51,477
- Hhhh ... Hey
- Shit.

360
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,297
Give me the word, boss.
I'll drop him.

361
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:54,467
Everybody calm down.

362
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,493
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

363
00:25:56,494 --> 00:25:57,701
Tell them: "Put it down".

364
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:58,195
Stand down.

365
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:01,850
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

366
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:02,684
What's for dinner?

367
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,693
Ames, if this man shoots me ...

368
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:06,569
I want you to kill him ...

369
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:09,199
And I want you to go and clear my browser history.

370
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:11,591
See ...

371
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:14,380
the firing pin is filed down, right?

372
00:26:14,381 --> 00:26:15,956
Mag full of dummy rounds.

373
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:18,058
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

374
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:19,669
You're absolutely right.

375
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,558
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

376
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,162
Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.

377
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:27,642
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

378
00:26:27,857 --> 00:26:29,652
I've known you, like, nine months.

379
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:32,409
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was real cookie.

380
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,476
What?

381
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:42,692
Y'all Jokers must be crazy.

382
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,040
All right.
Now you know what you're buyin'.

383
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:36,066
Let me tell you the price. First ...

384
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:37,772
I want outta here.

385
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:41,097
Second, I want full custody of my daughter.

386
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,168
All right?
And her mom can have, like ...

387
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:46,292
supervised visits. But, her boyfriend can't come.

388
00:27:46,293 --> 00:27:47,798
Darnell can't come.

389
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,433
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

390
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:52,515
Third, y'all gonna pay for my
daughter's whole education.

391
00:27:52,536 --> 00:27:55,269
Best schools.
And then I want her to go to college.

392
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,083
Like Harvard. Or Yale.

393
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:59,001
- So Ivy league.
- Ivy league, yeah.

394
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:00,523
One of them big joints, you know?

395
00:28:00,793 --> 00:28:02,618
And if she can't cut it ...

396
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:06,463
and her grades start slipping, I need you to
white- people that thing. You know how y'all do.

397
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,072
- Oh yeah.
- You know, right? Ok.

398
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,658
Now that's my price.
But I'm concerned ...

399
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:12,705
'cause I don't see
nobody writing shit down.

400
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:15,649
You're in no position
to make any demands.

401
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,781
Oh. I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.

402
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:20,374
No, errand boy.

403
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,410
I'm talking to your boss.

404
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:25,842
That's my price, sweetie.

405
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:27,564
You know what it is.

406
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,315
You notice these are criminals?

407
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:37,364
They're psychotic antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

408
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:39,469
Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you ...

409
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:41,353
a team of pipe hitters who'll do
anything you can dream up.

410
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:43,701
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

411
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:46,397
In WW2, the US Navy made a deal with he mafia ...

412
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,319
to protect its ships on the waterfront.

413
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:49,618
This ain't WW2.

414
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,391
It's WW3.

415
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:53,226
What are you really up to?

416
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:56,165
It's a "need- to- know", and, all you
need to know is you work for me.

417
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:57,945
That can change with a phone call.

418
00:28:58,131 --> 00:28:59,419
I have friends, too. You know.

419
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:03,486
There you go. Call'em.

420
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,390
But without you minding
her, your lady friend stays

421
00:29:06,522 --> 00:29:09,362
here strapped to a board
in a drug- induced coma.

422
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,430
They warned me about you.

423
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:16,448
I didn't believe the stories.

424
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,512
Nobody does.

425
00:29:33,377 --> 00:29:34,742
Where is she?

426
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:37,800
It's complex. This is not just her.

427
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:39,640
Everybody's disappeared.

428
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,263
This new law,
where if you're a bad enough, bad guy

429
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:43,786
they stamp "Terrorist" on your jacket.

430
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:46,661
They send you to this swamp in Louisiana.

431
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,363
A black site.

432
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,270
That's where she is.

433
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,288
So what are we doni'?

434
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:56,354
Bring the car around.

435
00:29:56,973 --> 00:29:59,176
We're going for a drive.

436
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:21,444
Lester! Lester!
Hit me one more time!

437
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:23,549
Come on, Man

438
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:26,470
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10k.

439
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,492
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

440
00:30:35,657 --> 00:30:36,699
Good job, Man.

441
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:37,930
He's killin' it.

442
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:39,384
Come on Man. Why am I here?

443
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:41,440
All right! Yeah! I'm down.
I get it! All right?

444
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:44,565
I've had run of bad decks.
Not my fault.

445
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:45,547
All right?

446
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,401
Dude, this is real.

447
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:50,907
I had to stop these guys from burning down
your house with your kids in it.

448
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,815
But, you're lucky.

449
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,547
Maybe. Why do you think so?

450
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:05,460
You. Slick, what's up?

451
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,394
Griggs. You are ...?

452
00:31:08,688 --> 00:31:10,420
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

453
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:11,835
Can I go, man?

454
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:13,009
What the hell's going on, man?

455
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:14,410
This is crazy.

456
00:31:20,265 --> 00:31:23,098
All of that chitchat's gonna get you hurt.

457
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,368
My God!

458
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:46,419
I could tell you meant that.

459
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:47,582
Yeah.

460
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,313
You're gonna be my friend.

461
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:11,666
Enchantress.

462
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:25,766
- Log time of death. 16:20
- June?

463
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:30,416
- Let's get her down to the morgue.
- June?

464
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,737
June?

465
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:33,541
June.

466
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,224
June.

467
00:32:38,838 --> 00:32:40,257
What did you do?

468
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,069
OK.

469
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:14,819
Sister.

470
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:17,286
Brother.

471
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,675
Pus, it could be the routing number.

472
00:33:24,491 --> 00:33:25,786
Wanna go for drinks?

473
00:33:37,591 --> 00:33:41,138
Brother I have freed you.

474
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,855
Where are we?

475
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:47,713
The same world only much later

476
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,321
What happened?

477
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,548
The humans turned against us

478
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:59,151
But they worshipped us?

479
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,188
We were gods to them

480
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:05,657
Now they worship machines

481
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,354
So I will build a machine

482
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:13,404
That will destroy them all

483
00:34:14,145 --> 00:34:15,951
Build your strength

484
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:17,244
Feed on them

485
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:20,210
And wait for me to return.

486
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:25,372
Enchantress.

487
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,291
God damn it!

488
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,684
June! June!

489
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,580
June! I'm sorry.

490
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,147
She went somewhere.

491
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:53,373
If you have to choose between her or me ...

492
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:55,057
stop her.

493
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,323
Promise me you'll stop her.

494
00:35:01,154 --> 00:35:02,664
Even if it kills me.

495
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:30,429
Sir!

496
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:32,099
Sir, You okay?

497
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:33,439
Can you breathe?

498
00:35:33,604 --> 00:35:35,337
Did you take anything?

499
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:38,668
This is 21. Send medical to my location.

500
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:40,549
I'm a physician.

501
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:42,653
Roger. Bringing medical to your location.<.i>

502
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:45,016
No pulse. Starting compressions.

503
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:13,453
Sir

504
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:15,279
Midway city is under attack.

505
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:16,598
It's a non- human entity.

506
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:18,441
I think you know what to do, sir.

507
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:20,493
Activate Task Force X ...

508
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,519
and get Amanda Waller and her whole circus
on scene ASAP. (ASAP = as soon as possible)

509
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:24,032
Sir

510
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:28,365
We're gonna live with Task Force X. Pull'em.

511
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:35,651
Prisoners, get down on your knees. Now!

512
00:36:35,747 --> 00:36:37,598
Down on your knees! Hands in the air!
Turn around.

513
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:38,439
Hands up high!

514
00:36:38,536 --> 00:36:40,130
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

515
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,302
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

516
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,451
Do not fire that goddamn weapon!

517
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:49,190
Damn it!

518
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,483
Open the gate!

519
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,327
Everybody, line up for extraction.

520
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:56,205
Let's go! Let's move, move!

521
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:59,233
Yeah! Open the door! Let's go!

522
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,705
Hit him!

523
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:08,357
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

524
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:10,822
Where you at?

525
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,090
Is that the new guy?

526
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:24,883
What is that?

527
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:26,447
What is that?

528
00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:28,517
- Who are you?
- Standby. Arming device.

529
00:37:28,632 --> 00:37:29,675
Who are you? I don't know who you are.

530
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:30,535
Device armed.

531
00:37:30,536 --> 00:37:33,234
Hey ... I'm talking to you.
Hey ... I'm talking to you.

532
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:35,274
Injection Successful.

533
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:37,426
Location verified.

534
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:40,274
Anybody who touches me is dead.

535
00:37:40,576 --> 00:37:41,630
Anybody who ...

536
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:43,230
lady.

537
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:44,667
Injection Successful.

538
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:47,487
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

539
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,597
Next!

540
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:51,083
Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.

541
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:54,222
Come on.

542
00:37:55,454 --> 00:37:56,777
Shut up, and get it done.

543
00:38:00,518 --> 00:38:02,156
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

544
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:03,561
It's from Mr. J.

545
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:05,201
You gonna tell him I took care of you?

546
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:07,938
You're so screwed.

547
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,846
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

548
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:11,004
Get off me! Get off me!

549
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:12,453
Harley, what do you mean by that?

550
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:14,662
Harley!

551
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:23,631
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr.Van Criss.

552
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:26,762
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

553
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,258
Cool if I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.

554
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,551
Thank you. You're a good man.

555
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:46,501
Open up.

556
00:38:55,075 --> 00:38:57,258
Just please, do whatever they say.<.i>

557
00:38:57,956 --> 00:39:00,554
Do whatever they say. Just do it.<.i>

558
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,541
This look neat.

559
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,977
Light it up! Light it up! Light it up!

560
00:39:30,322 --> 00:39:31,906
He's right above us.

561
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,127
This is a mistake.
Rick, I can't do this.

562
00:39:34,128 --> 00:39:35,488
- I can't d ...
- Listen ... Listen

563
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,168
There is no other way.

564
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,451
Just get it done.

565
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:43,187
Just get it done.

566
00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:48,001
Enchantress.

567
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,124
Flag, talk to me.
What' going on down there?

568
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,248
Amanda, she is bolted.<.i>

569
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:54,698
Say it again?

570
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:56,230
She is bolted.

571
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:57,979
Shit!

572
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:04,569
Brother help me.

573
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:08,239
Before she kills me.

574
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,012
Where's your heart?

575
00:40:24,328 --> 00:40:26,259
I will take it back.

576
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,608
Untill then you will share your power.

577
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,656
Now help me build my weapon.

578
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:36,807
It's time to wipe them out.

579
00:40:59,697 --> 00:41:00,613
Go!

580
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,884
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

581
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:15,733
I thought this was contained!

582
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:22,822
Guys. I need all three of you follow me please.

583
00:41:24,786 --> 00:41:26,379
Anybody with blood.

584
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,362
This is the worst day of my life.

585
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,108
All evacuees must report
to a FEMA representative.<.i>

586
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,576
What's going on in that city?

587
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:43,640
Those assholes here yet?

588
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:45,882
Yeah. They're here.

589
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,753
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

590
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,600
What the hell, Flag?

591
00:41:57,044 --> 00:41:58,180
Unlock'em.

592
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,850
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

593
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:10,400
How do you do?

594
00:42:16,598 --> 00:42:17,329
Haaah?

595
00:42:17,939 --> 00:42:18,936
What was that?

596
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:21,192
I should kill everyone and escape?

597
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:25,821
Sorry. The voices.

598
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,814
I'm kidding. Jeez!

599
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:32,058
That's not what they really said.

600
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:33,783
What do we got here?

601
00:42:33,786 --> 00:42:36,693
12 pounds of shit in a 10- pound sack.

602
00:42:42,372 --> 00:42:44,273
Welcome to party, Capitan Boomerang.

603
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:50,612
Hey, hey, hey ... What's going on, man?

604
00:42:50,738 --> 00:42:51,893
Calm down.

605
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:54,151
Hey, one minute I'm playing Mahjong with me nanna ...

606
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:56,486
then this red streak hits me outta nowhere.

607
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,128
Shut up! You were caught robbing a diamond exchange.

608
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:00,603
I was not.

609
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:03,555
Here comes Slipknot ...

610
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:06,475
the man who climb anything. Wonderful.

611
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,257
Have a good time, scumbag.

612
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:11,807
Straighten up!

613
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:15,544
She had a mouth.

614
00:43:17,082 --> 00:43:17,809
Listen up!

615
00:43:18,448 --> 00:43:19,892
In your necks ...

616
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:23,908
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

617
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,507
As the size of a rice grain ...

618
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,661
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

619
00:43:28,432 --> 00:43:31,039
You disobey me, you die.

620
00:43:32,634 --> 00:43:35,187
You try to escape, you die.

621
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:39,775
You otherwise irritate or vex me, and guess what?

622
00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:41,452
You die.

623
00:43:41,783 --> 00:43:44,836
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

624
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,154
Lady, shut up!

625
00:43:47,185 --> 00:43:48,347
This is the deal.

626
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,494
You're going somewhere very bad ...

627
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:53,864
to do something that'll get you killed.

628
00:43:54,004 --> 00:43:55,396
But until that happens ...

629
00:43:56,743 --> 00:43:58,188
you're my problem.

630
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:02,099
So was that like a pep talk?

631
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:03,615
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

632
00:44:03,737 --> 00:44:05,545
There's your shit.

633
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:08,106
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

634
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,608
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

635
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,100
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

636
00:44:12,211 --> 00:44:14,460
He's like a gold standard. OK?

637
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:17,172
Triangle, bitch. Study
(Kind of strategy for effective attacking in basketball)

638
00:45:19,946 --> 00:45:21,008
What?

639
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:28,972
Won't fit anymore?

640
00:45:30,445 --> 00:45:32,170
Too much junk in the trunk?

641
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,289
Nah. Every time I put this on, somebody dies.

642
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:38,444
And?

643
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,090
I like putting it on.

644
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,001
Goody.

645
00:45:43,253 --> 00:45:46,472
Somethin' tells me a whole lotta
people are about to die.

646
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:47,911
Yeah. It's us.

647
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:49,461
We're being led to our deaths.

648
00:45:49,576 --> 00:45:50,806
Speak for yourself mate.

649
00:45:51,197 --> 00:45:53,347
Hey, what's that crop on your face?
Does it wash off?

650
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,978
Hey, if you like a girl, can you
light her cigarette with your pinkie?

651
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,687
Because that would be real classy.

652
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:02,345
Hey, y'all might wanna leave old boy alone.

653
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:04,624
He could torch this whole joint.

654
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:05,918
Ain't right, ese?

655
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,470
Ain't got nothing to worry about from me.

656
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:10,015
I'm cool, homie.

657
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,212
Behold the voice of god.

658
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,877
For those of you who
don't know me officially ...<.i>

659
00:46:16,977 --> 00:46:18,734
My Name is Amanda Waller.<.i>

660
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,967
There's an active terrorist event in Midway City.

661
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:27,667
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT- 1 and get them to safety.

662
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:29,085
I'm sorry.

663
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:33,693
For those of us who don't speak good guy,
what is HVT- 1?

664
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:35,864
The only person that matters in the city ...

665
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:37,817
the one person you can't kill.

666
00:46:38,613 --> 00:46:41,489
Complete the mission, you get
time off your prison sentence.

667
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,340
Fail the mission, you die.

668
00:46:43,473 --> 00:46:45,216
Anything happens to Colonel Flag ...<.i>

669
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,055
I'll kill every single one of you.

670
00:46:48,259 --> 00:46:49,837
Remember, I'm watching.<.i>

671
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:52,712
I see everything.

672
00:46:55,722 --> 00:46:57,339
There's your pep talk.

673
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,843
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

674
00:47:00,492 --> 00:47:01,777
So that's it?

675
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:04,848
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

676
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:07,227
I'll notify your next of kin.

677
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,092
Alpha, Bravo team, Mount up!

678
00:47:16,923 --> 00:47:18,017
Your' late.

679
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:19,483
I was busy.

680
00:47:30,837 --> 00:47:32,509
Please have mercy.

681
00:47:33,085 --> 00:47:34,844
Where was the mercy for my husband?

682
00:47:34,975 --> 00:47:36,942
I didn't kill him.

683
00:47:37,484 --> 00:47:39,048
But you watched.

684
00:47:39,782 --> 00:47:41,959
Criminals deserve no mercy.

685
00:47:44,879 --> 00:47:46,047
This is Katana.

686
00:47:46,176 --> 00:47:47,364
She's got my back.

687
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,569
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke ...

688
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,864
Just like mowing the lawn.

689
00:47:53,008 --> 00:47:55,228
I would advise not getting killed by her.

690
00:47:55,388 --> 00:47:58,527
Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

691
00:47:59,226 --> 00:48:01,609
Harley Quinn.
Nice to meet ya.

692
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,412
Love your perfume.

693
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,552
What is that? The stench of death?

694
00:48:07,978 --> 00:48:09,793
- Should I kill them?
- Easy cowgirl.

695
00:48:09,934 --> 00:48:12,251
Ain't that kind of mission.
Have a seat..

696
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,185
She seems nice.

697
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:30,027
I'm coming for you.

698
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:50,743
Look at that pretty lights!

699
00:48:51,768 --> 00:48:53,585
Are you guys seein' this?

700
00:48:55,321 --> 00:48:56,242
What happened?

701
00:48:58,138 --> 00:48:59,679
Terror attack.

702
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,316
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

703
00:49:03,387 --> 00:49:05,285
You know, usual shit.

704
00:49:05,386 --> 00:49:06,386
Right.

705
00:49:07,338 --> 00:49:09,161
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

706
00:49:10,298 --> 00:49:11,404
I don't know if they told you ...

707
00:49:11,536 --> 00:49:14,714
but I'm a hitman. I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

708
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:16,314
Anything for a dollar, right?

709
00:49:16,882 --> 00:49:19,637
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

710
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:21,452
I'm a soldier!

711
00:49:21,883 --> 00:49:24,727
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

712
00:49:24,856 --> 00:49:26,223
When the shooting starts ...

713
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:29,744
and it will,
you'll cut and run.

714
00:49:44,036 --> 00:49:45,294
Six- one is going down.

715
00:49:45,295 --> 00:49:47,617
Six- one is going down hard.

716
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:03,266
Stand by. Drop the ramp.

717
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,103
What a ride!

718
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:17,629
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.

719
00:50:35,225 --> 00:50:36,217
Mind games.

720
00:50:36,218 --> 00:50:39,188
What's that?
- All this bomb in the neck crap.

721
00:50:40,305 --> 00:50:41,422
That ain't real, mate

722
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:44,491
See. They're trying to trap us
with our own minds. Right?

723
00:50:44,613 --> 00:50:47,720
But you look around, we're free, brah.

724
00:50:47,915 --> 00:50:49,108
How do you know this?

725
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:51,190
Just trust me. I know, all right?
It's a con.

726
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:54,193
Now I'm going.
Because I got a life to live.

727
00:50:54,727 --> 00:50:56,528
Question is, are you coming?

728
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:02,761
Yeah! Smart!

729
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:25,712
Hold your fire.

730
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:29,936
Sorry. It's what I do.

731
00:51:41,703 --> 00:51:42,704
Damn it.

732
00:51:44,472 --> 00:51:46,073
Now that's a killer app!

733
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,417
Okay. You wanna keep playing ...

734
00:51:48,427 --> 00:51:51,016
the Hollywood Squares <.i>version of
"I'll Blow your freaking Head Off?"

735
00:51:51,338 --> 00:51:52,427
Are you next?

736
00:51:53,164 --> 00:51:54,298
You tripping, homie.

737
00:51:55,352 --> 00:51:56,553
You next, Deadshot?

738
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,881
You just threatened me?

739
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:02,335
Oh, yeah.

740
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:04,669
He just threatened me.

741
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:09,256
Move.

742
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:11,395
You got a boyfriend?

743
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,518
I'm gonna kill him.

744
00:52:16,773 --> 00:52:20,027
Well, you better make it quick
'cause he's gonna kill all of us one by one.

745
00:52:20,419 --> 00:52:23,162
I'm gonna drop him. The sword lady.
Five or seven of these SEALs.

746
00:52:23,163 --> 00:52:25,022
After that, I'm gonna need some help.
You down?

747
00:52:25,205 --> 00:52:27,607
Always. What about
the shit in our necks?

748
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:31,098
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

749
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,048
You're my friend, too.

750
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:40,285
Stay evil, doll face, Spread the word.

751
00:52:43,657 --> 00:52:46,584
I'm standing by for follow on tasking.<.i>

752
00:52:56,813 --> 00:52:58,923
C2, what is the operational load of the PLS?

753
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,795
Boss, we got people up here.

754
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:03,201
I'm on my way.

755
00:53:15,935 --> 00:53:16,906
Shit!

756
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,962
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.<.i>

757
00:53:19,088 --> 00:53:20,556
Flag. Get out of there.

758
00:53:20,832 --> 00:53:23,223
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.<.i>

759
00:53:23,427 --> 00:53:24,428
Copy that.

760
00:53:25,105 --> 00:53:26,434
We're diverting.

761
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,193
Bump out second two squad two blocks east.

762
00:53:29,299 --> 00:53:30,500
We'll pass through you ...

763
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:31,758
continue north.

764
00:53:32,177 --> 00:53:33,772
Take Bravo two blocks east.

765
00:53:33,776 --> 00:53:35,564
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

766
00:53:35,571 --> 00:53:36,572
Copy that.

767
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:47,140
Hey. I like these odds, mate.

768
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:48,495
You just say the word.

769
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:49,626
Yeah.

770
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:51,339
Come on.

771
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:52,711
Yeah.

772
00:53:53,216 --> 00:53:54,484
Hold that thought.

773
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,910
Rick, why do they look like that?

774
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:06,996
Just stay cool.

775
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:20,929
The hell are they?

776
00:54:21,673 --> 00:54:24,188
You cut run.
I'll blow your head off.

777
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,691
Hit'em!

778
00:55:33,899 --> 00:55:34,757
Hey.

779
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:01,702
Get off me!

780
00:56:05,785 --> 00:56:07,361
Get off me! Son of a ...

781
00:56:11,726 --> 00:56:12,727
Flag!

782
00:56:14,273 --> 00:56:15,439
- Good riddance
- Harley

783
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:16,460
He dies. We die.

784
00:56:29,273 --> 00:56:30,540
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

785
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:34,017
Backblast, clear!

786
00:57:23,085 --> 00:57:24,086
Pinky.

787
00:57:28,415 --> 00:57:30,780
That's how I cut and run.

788
00:57:38,349 --> 00:57:39,350
Hey.

789
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:40,830
Hey. Come on.

790
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,999
What? I saw it move.

791
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:46,710
See? It flinched.
I think.

792
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:49,617
Hey. You were some help. Princess.

793
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:51,516
It's better this way.

794
00:57:51,964 --> 00:57:52,965
Trust me.

795
00:57:53,357 --> 00:57:55,210
Oh, yeah you're the fire bloke. Eh?

796
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:55,706
Yeah, I was. Yeah.

797
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,381
Right. Yeah. Hey.

798
00:57:58,586 --> 00:57:59,654
Well. Look at here.

799
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,301
It's fire.

800
00:58:09,868 --> 00:58:11,073
Wants to explain this?

801
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:12,641
If I told you, would you believe me?

802
00:58:14,326 --> 00:58:16,065
- What are they?
- I don't know.

803
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:17,487
That's bullshit.

804
00:58:18,008 --> 00:58:20,518
This guy had a 3000$ watch.

805
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:23,233
Is that a Person?

806
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,246
It was.

807
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,071
Now it's not.

808
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,791
Hey, don't.

809
00:58:30,087 --> 00:58:31,423
What?

810
00:58:31,688 --> 00:58:33,292
We got a job to do.

811
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:37,153
Keep movin'.

812
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:41,884
Get your boys moving.

813
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,890
Let's go.

814
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:56,424
Waller, we are moving toward the objective.

815
00:58:56,548 --> 00:58:58,587
...Contacting Bravo. You got the visual?

816
00:58:58,628 --> 00:58:59,427
Stand by.

817
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:00,775
Anything on the squadron?

818
00:59:00,812 --> 00:59:01,670
No ma'am.

819
00:59:01,978 --> 00:59:04,503
Code7 I need your sensors
in those coordinates.

820
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:05,609
Flag, it's a negative.

821
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,650
[???], But we've lost them.

822
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:46,549
Seriously?

823
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:48,626
What the hell is wrong with you people?

824
00:59:49,146 --> 00:59:52,805
We're bad guys.
It's what we do.

825
01:00:11,563 --> 01:00:12,564
Take a knee.

826
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:20,071
Our body's at the top of that building.

827
01:00:20,765 --> 01:00:21,093
We get up there ...

828
01:00:21,347 --> 01:00:23,091
Pull them out of
the vault they're hiding in.

829
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,180
Helos extract us off the roof.

830
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,968
- It's miller times.
- Check

831
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:40,695
Waller?

832
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:44,350
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.<.i>

833
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:50,010
What do say we get this over with?

834
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:51,445
What the hell? Deadshot.

835
01:00:51,558 --> 01:00:52,834
Fall back.

836
01:00:58,636 --> 01:01:00,466
You mind if we tag along?

837
01:01:14,131 --> 01:01:16,079
Look like we have a spot of luck.eh?

838
01:01:16,984 --> 01:01:18,737
Be a walk in the park.

839
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:20,525
Easy peasy.

840
01:01:20,622 --> 01:01:22,766
Don't make me shoot you.

841
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:29,873
God damn it. Harley!

842
01:01:30,132 --> 01:01:31,483
Go! Go! Go! Go!

843
01:01:35,757 --> 01:01:38,081
I am coming to my lady ...

844
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:20,284
Hey, guys!

845
01:02:27,207 --> 01:02:28,571
Come on. Let's go.

846
01:02:37,982 --> 01:02:41,663
Ma'am. I got motion detectors
going off on the secure floors.

847
01:02:44,066 --> 01:02:44,904
Flag...

848
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,399
- They’re all around you.<.i>
- Hold

849
01:02:46,483 --> 01:02:48,694
Use extreme caution.

850
01:02:50,259 --> 01:02:51,604
I don’t like this, Flag.

851
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:54,931
I don’t like it either.

852
01:02:59,732 --> 01:03:00,697
Pussy.

853
01:03:00,698 --> 01:03:02,657
I will knock your ass out.

854
01:03:03,002 --> 01:03:05,257
I do not care that you're a girl.

855
01:03:54,943 --> 01:03:56,305
They're after Flag again.

856
01:03:57,591 --> 01:03:59,042
Get off me.

857
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:05,168
Circle up. Circle around him.

858
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,531
Let me fight!

859
01:04:11,532 --> 01:04:13,128
You die. We die.

860
01:04:16,161 --> 01:04:18,144
Clear! Everyone move out.

861
01:04:32,642 --> 01:04:34,396
- Where you been, homie?
- This ain’t my fight!

862
01:04:34,397 --> 01:04:37,181
You know what? You don’t stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!

863
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:38,484
Don't touch me, man!

864
01:04:38,485 --> 01:04:39,749
- Don’t touch you? What you gonna do?
- Don't touch me!

865
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,767
I’m touching you! I’m touching you!

866
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:43,701
- Do something. Do something!
- Don’t touch me!

867
01:04:43,853 --> 01:04:44,982
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see ...

868
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:46,719
- You wanna see something?
- Yes I wanna see something.

869
01:05:11,663 --> 01:05:13,551
I was just trying to get you there.

870
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,404
Phil Jackson. We good, right?

871
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:21,128
I knew you'd come through.

872
01:05:21,644 --> 01:05:23,212
That shit crazy.

873
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:34,478
Clear.

874
01:05:47,827 --> 01:05:50,439
I gotta work on my cardio.

875
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:01,028
Question.

876
01:06:03,912 --> 01:06:05,754
Would you die for me?

877
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:08,859
Yes.

878
01:06:09,077 --> 01:06:10,681
That's too easy.

879
01:06:11,669 --> 01:06:13,326
Would you ...?

880
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:17,037
Would you live for me?

881
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:21,904
Yes

882
01:06:22,902 --> 01:06:24,539
Careful.

883
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:29,831
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

884
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:31,910
Desire becomes surrender.

885
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,757
Surrender becomes power.

886
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:40,021
Do you want this?

887
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:42,074
I do.

888
01:06:42,075 --> 01:06:43,626
Say it.

889
01:06:43,772 --> 01:06:46,329
Say it. Say it.

890
01:06:46,471 --> 01:06:49,087
Pretty, pretty, pretty ...

891
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:50,257
Please.

892
01:06:51,453 --> 01:06:53,291
God, you're so ...

893
01:06:53,803 --> 01:06:54,804
Good.

894
01:08:02,183 --> 01:08:03,073
Relax.

895
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,081
Just me.

896
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:10,037
You ever been in love?

897
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:14,026
Nah. Never.

898
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,365
Bullshit.

899
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:19,270
You don't kill as many people as
I've killed and still sleep like a kitten

900
01:08:19,398 --> 01:08:21,199
If you feel shit like love.

901
01:08:23,549 --> 01:08:25,774
Another textbook sociopath.

902
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,639
Clear.

903
01:08:30,662 --> 01:08:31,958
Clear.

904
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:34,391
All right, secure the roof.

905
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:37,343
Sweep for shooters
so we can bring in our aviation assets.

906
01:08:37,545 --> 01:08:38,646
Going to the roof.

907
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:47,360
Wait here.

908
01:08:47,519 --> 01:08:48,520
Please.

909
01:08:48,723 --> 01:08:51,993
I don't wanna gave this dude
a heart attack okay?

910
01:08:52,338 --> 01:08:54,247
He's embarrassed of us.

911
01:08:54,277 --> 01:08:55,278
Hey, Flag.

912
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:59,422
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

913
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:08,077
You ready? Let's go.

914
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,424
You wouldn't have made it without them.

915
01:09:10,475 --> 01:09:13,457
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

916
01:09:13,561 --> 01:09:16,123
Admit it, rick. I was right.

917
01:09:16,255 --> 01:09:17,917
Yeah, I told you to get on the damn truck.

918
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:18,819
Why'd you say?

919
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:20,857
I was studying your girlfriend.

920
01:09:20,995 --> 01:09:22,458
She takes an average person ...

921
01:09:22,599 --> 01:09:25,903
A yoga mom an elderly retiree
and she turns them into a soldier

922
01:09:25,904 --> 01:09:28,095
Who can take a headshot and still fight.

923
01:09:28,595 --> 01:09:30,224
It's an instant army.

924
01:09:31,026 --> 01:09:32,427
How'd she do it. Flag?

925
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:34,247
How'd she game the system ...

926
01:09:34,248 --> 01:09:36,335
With you watching her every move?

927
01:09:39,364 --> 01:09:41,230
I'll accept the consequences

928
01:09:41,768 --> 01:09:43,343
I am your consequence.

929
01:09:43,383 --> 01:09:45,227
You might need to be careful.

930
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:47,997
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

931
01:09:48,088 --> 01:09:49,625
I can take care of myself.

932
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:51,642
- Shut it down, wipe the drivers.
- Yes, ma'am.

933
01:09:51,803 --> 01:09:53,040
Copy that.

934
01:09:53,762 --> 01:09:56,096
Hey, man I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped ...

935
01:09:56,136 --> 01:09:59,188
In your temple of
soldierly self- righteousness ...

936
01:09:59,357 --> 01:10:02,562
But a two- faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

937
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:04,573
Oh, says the guy who shoots people for money.

938
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:05,970
My cards is on the table, man.

939
01:10:05,977 --> 01:10:07,445
It got done. Didn't it?

940
01:10:13,149 --> 01:10:16,085
Damn. That is just ...

941
01:10:16,105 --> 01:10:18,592
A mean lady.

942
01:10:18,674 --> 01:10:20,075
Yeah. You get used to it.

943
01:10:22,048 --> 01:10:24,364
And I'm the bad guy?

944
01:10:28,044 --> 01:10:29,045
That's gangsta.

945
01:10:31,044 --> 01:10:31,943
What?

946
01:10:31,949 --> 01:10:33,651
They weren't cleared
for any of this any of it.

947
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:37,176
Hey. I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes, too.

948
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,854
No way.

949
01:10:58,697 --> 01:10:59,697
Let's go home.

950
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,661
Yeah. Let's go home.

951
01:11:02,857 --> 01:11:05,318
That sounds good.
You guys wanna go home?

952
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,631
Or you wanna go back to prison?

953
01:11:07,873 --> 01:11:09,698
I'm not going back to prison.

954
01:11:09,713 --> 01:11:10,754
What I'm saying is ...

955
01:11:11,079 --> 01:11:13,405
We kill the pair of 'em now
before they kill us.

956
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:14,961
I got this.

957
01:11:18,855 --> 01:11:20,522
You all made it this far.

958
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:25,036
Don't get high- spirited on me
and run a good thing.

959
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:42,386
I like her.

960
01:11:46,662 --> 01:11:47,287
Savior one- zero,

961
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:48,971
this is Ground Element.

962
01:11:52,383 --> 01:11:54,611
Savior one- zero,
how copy?

963
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:59,038
Savior one- zero, the LZ's clear.

964
01:12:04,598 --> 01:12:06,162
Boss, they're not talking to me.

965
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:09,548
Our bird's been jacked.

966
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:11,528
Light it up!

967
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,245
What? I got hickey or something?

968
01:12:40,252 --> 01:12:42,977
Professor, could you pick up the pace?

969
01:12:45,454 --> 01:12:47,153
Now!

970
01:12:54,641 --> 01:12:55,642
Harley!

971
01:12:58,775 --> 01:12:59,776
Hello, baby.

972
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:03,841
Kill her!

973
01:13:05,566 --> 01:13:07,657
Her nanite's disarmed!

974
01:13:09,817 --> 01:13:10,818
Come on, baby.

975
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:27,642
Deadshot ...

976
01:13:28,795 --> 01:13:30,597
Shoot that woman right now!

977
01:13:30,922 --> 01:13:32,765
She ain't do shit to me.

978
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:34,959
You're a hitman. Right?

979
01:13:35,095 --> 01:13:36,467
I got a contract.

980
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:38,031
Kill Harley Quinn.

981
01:13:38,095 --> 01:13:40,364
Do it your freedom
and your kid.

982
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,266
Now she dead.

983
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:24,728
I missed.

984
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:31,009
Good one, mate.

985
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:33,008
It's Waller.

986
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:37,141
Savior one- zero's been hijaked.
Shoot it down.

987
01:14:37,142 --> 01:14:38,989
Rager that ma'am.
Going hot.

988
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:47,863
Puddin'!

989
01:14:53,093 --> 01:14:55,243
You got all dressed up for me?

990
01:14:55,355 --> 01:14:57,655
You know I'd do anything for you.

991
01:14:57,819 --> 01:14:58,326
By the way ...

992
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:02,214
I've got some grape soda on ice,
and a bear skin rug waitin'.

993
01:15:02,222 --> 01:15:03,223
Yeah?

994
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:05,061
Boss, we got a problem.

995
01:15:10,533 --> 01:15:13,893
- This bird is baked.
- No.

996
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:17,772
Okay, honey. It’s me and you.

997
01:15:17,778 --> 01:15:19,107
Let’s do it.

998
01:15:45,648 --> 01:15:46,983
Target destroyed, ma’am

999
01:15:47,296 --> 01:15:49,611
Thank you.Now get me off this roof.

1000
01:15:50,428 --> 01:15:52,058
Yes, ma'am.We are inbound.

1001
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:57,731
The Joker and Harley Quinn are no more.

1002
01:16:02,832 --> 01:16:04,567
You couldn’t save her.

1003
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:10,109
Roger.I see ya.

1004
01:16:13,454 --> 01:16:14,692
Watch your step. Ma’am.

1005
01:16:16,728 --> 01:16:19,510
Stand by. I’ll send another helo!

1006
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,938
Waller's down.

1007
01:17:22,608 --> 01:17:23,609
It’s over.

1008
01:17:24,165 --> 01:17:27,434
Ops just confirmed.
She’s down. 1k west.

1009
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:31,764
Let’s go get her.

1010
01:17:37,289 --> 01:17:38,823
The mission’s not over.

1011
01:17:38,929 --> 01:17:42,205
Nah. It is for me.
We had a deal.

1012
01:17:42,344 --> 01:17:44,479
Without Waller, you got nothing.

1013
01:18:30,529 --> 01:18:32,998
Hey, guys. I’m back!

1014
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:37,166
I missed you all so much.

1015
01:18:37,822 --> 01:18:39,956
We're glad you could make it.

1016
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:56,233
Hey, craziness.

1017
01:19:15,675 --> 01:19:17,868
Bring me my sister’s heart.

1018
01:19:42,329 --> 01:19:46,116
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

1019
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:50,268
Now tell me how to
destroy your armies.

1020
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:52,619
Do your worst, bitch!

1021
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:22,106
So let me guess.

1022
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:26,398
We’re going to the swirling
wing of trash in the sky.

1023
01:20:26,826 --> 01:20:28,445
You know, 'cause why wouldn’t we?

1024
01:20:30,445 --> 01:20:32,960
When does this end, Flag?

1025
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,775
Load up.
We’re in for a fight.

1026
01:20:59,918 --> 01:21:03,105
You tell everybody everything.

1027
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:06,082
Or me and you are gonna go right now.

1028
01:21:12,278 --> 01:21:13,344
Three days ago,

1029
01:21:13,352 --> 01:21:16,338
a non- human entity appeared in the subway station.

1030
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:19,380
Waller, we’re almost there.

1031
01:21:19,478 --> 01:21:23,340
So Waller sent me and
a woman with incredibles abilities.

1032
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,298
Enchantress

1033
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:27,257
A witch.

1034
01:21:28,736 --> 01:21:30,267
See, nobody could get near this thing ...

1035
01:21:30,273 --> 01:21:32,230
but the witch could.

1036
01:21:34,267 --> 01:21:35,461
Bombs ready.

1037
01:21:35,572 --> 01:21:38,862
Set for two seconds. You just
press the button and drop it.

1038
01:21:42,683 --> 01:21:45,597
Needless to say the whole thing was a bad idea.

1039
01:21:45,606 --> 01:21:47,113
She bolted!

1040
01:21:47,829 --> 01:21:48,830
Shit!

1041
01:21:53,317 --> 01:21:54,863
Brother help me.

1042
01:21:56,432 --> 01:21:59,428
And that’s how she escaped from Waller.

1043
01:22:01,611 --> 01:22:03,212
So now you know.

1044
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:06,470
You can just kill me right now ...

1045
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:09,541
but I'm going to have a drink.

1046
01:22:09,588 --> 01:22:11,611
Hey! Deadshot, I need your help.

1047
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:14,413
No, sir. You need a miracle.

1048
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:52,227
Here’s to honor among thieves

1049
01:22:52,494 --> 01:22:53,495
I’m not a thief.

1050
01:22:55,944 --> 01:22:58,000
Oh.She’s not a thief.

1051
01:23:02,779 --> 01:23:04,848
Well, we almost pulled it off ...

1052
01:23:05,233 --> 01:23:08,546
Despite what everybody thought.

1053
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:12,557
Worst part of it is, they’re gonna
blame us for the whole thing.

1054
01:23:12,615 --> 01:23:14,914
And they can’t have people
knowing the truth.

1055
01:23:15,383 --> 01:23:17,053
We’re the patsies.

1056
01:23:17,187 --> 01:23:18,567
The cover-up.

1057
01:23:19,716 --> 01:23:23,168
Don’t forget, we’re the bad guys.

1058
01:23:26,493 --> 01:23:30,174
For about two sweet seconds ...

1059
01:23:30,573 --> 01:23:31,574
I had hope.

1060
01:23:32,734 --> 01:23:33,868
You had hope huh?

1061
01:23:36,129 --> 01:23:39,179
Hope don’t stop the wheel
from turning, my brother.

1062
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:40,681
You preaching?

1063
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,877
It’s coming back around for you.

1064
01:23:43,213 --> 01:23:45,911
How many people you killed, man?

1065
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:48,352
You don’t ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

1066
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:51,450
You ain’t ever whacked down no women.

1067
01:23:51,586 --> 01:23:53,255
No kids.

1068
01:23:54,584 --> 01:23:56,636
I don’t kill women and children.

1069
01:23:56,871 --> 01:23:57,872
I do.

1070
01:24:01,053 --> 01:24:03,588
See, I was born with the Devil’s gift.

1071
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:06,373
I kept it hidden most of my life, but ...

1072
01:24:07,317 --> 01:24:10,494
The older I got, the stronger I got.

1073
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:12,576
So I started using it.

1074
01:24:13,469 --> 01:24:15,447
For business, you know

1075
01:24:15,987 --> 01:24:17,747
The more power on the street I got ...

1076
01:24:17,748 --> 01:24:18,917
The more firepower I got.

1077
01:24:18,918 --> 01:24:20,259
Like that shit went hand in hand.

1078
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,547
You know? One was feeding the other.

1079
01:24:23,661 --> 01:24:25,999
Ain’t nobody tell me no.

1080
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:28,702
Except my old lady.

1081
01:24:31,221 --> 01:24:33,478
You know, she used to pray for me.

1082
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:34,999
You’re welcome.

1083
01:24:37,062 --> 01:24:38,863
Even when I didn’t want it.

1084
01:24:49,081 --> 01:24:51,530
God didn’t give me this.

1085
01:24:51,799 --> 01:24:54,266
Why should he take it away?

1086
01:24:55,024 --> 01:24:56,025
Hey.

1087
01:24:58,365 --> 01:24:59,372
This is our home.

1088
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:01,196
You put that back where you found it.

1089
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:03,099
I’m taking my kids to my Mom’s.

1090
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,125
You ain’t taking my kids nowhere!

1091
01:25:05,315 --> 01:25:09,083
See when I get mad, I lose
control you know, I just ...

1092
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,355
I don’t know what I do ...

1093
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:18,661
till it’s done.

1094
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:35,010
And the kids?

1095
01:25:38,525 --> 01:25:40,068
He killed them.

1096
01:25:44,053 --> 01:25:45,496
Didn’t you?

1097
01:25:53,669 --> 01:25:55,455
Own that shit.

1098
01:25:56,224 --> 01:25:57,225
Own it.

1099
01:25:57,391 --> 01:25:59,696
What’d you think was
gonna happen? Huh?

1100
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,820
Hey Harley, Come on.

1101
01:26:01,873 --> 01:26:03,729
What you were just ...

1102
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,026
Thinking you can have a happy family ...

1103
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:08,219
And coach little leagues
and make car payments?

1104
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:12,795
Normal’s a setting on the dryer.
People like us, we don’t get normal!

1105
01:26:12,796 --> 01:26:15,078
Why is it always a knife fight…

1106
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:17,480
every single time you open your mouth?

1107
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:23,110
You know, outside you’re amazing.

1108
01:26:24,435 --> 01:26:27,430
But inside, you’re ugly.

1109
01:26:27,431 --> 01:26:29,315
We all are.

1110
01:26:29,423 --> 01:26:31,862
We all are!

1111
01:26:31,883 --> 01:26:33,081
Except for him.

1112
01:26:34,635 --> 01:26:36,545
He’s ugly on the outside, too.

1113
01:26:36,551 --> 01:26:38,552
Not me, shorty.

1114
01:26:42,784 --> 01:26:44,656
I’m beautiful.

1115
01:26:44,957 --> 01:26:47,382
Yeah, you are.

1116
01:26:57,342 --> 01:26:58,878
We don’t want you here.

1117
01:27:06,329 --> 01:27:10,483
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1118
01:27:11,344 --> 01:27:12,345
Yeah.

1119
01:27:13,991 --> 01:27:16,973
I never been with a witch before.
What’s that like?

1120
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:24,142
Apparently that’s why the creatures
chase him all the time.

1121
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:26,420
‘Cause the witch is scared of him.

1122
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:28,809
The only woman I ever cared about ...

1123
01:27:28,811 --> 01:27:31,288
is trapped inside that monster.

1124
01:27:31,417 --> 01:27:36,192
If I don’t stop the witch, it’s over.
Everything is over.

1125
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:37,442
Everything.

1126
01:27:41,146 --> 01:27:42,347
You’re free to go.

1127
01:27:56,654 --> 01:27:59,724
Your daughter writes you everyday.

1128
01:28:02,552 --> 01:28:04,465
Every single day.

1129
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,054
You had these the whole time?

1130
01:28:23,558 --> 01:28:26,920
You had letters from my daughter the whole time?

1131
01:28:31,076 --> 01:28:32,611
I’m gonna get you there.

1132
01:28:33,586 --> 01:28:35,254
And you’re gonna end this.

1133
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:37,966
I’m gonna carry your ass if I have to.

1134
01:28:39,109 --> 01:28:42,699
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

1135
01:28:42,704 --> 01:28:45,457
Everybody’s gonna know what we did.

1136
01:28:45,702 --> 01:28:49,099
And my daughter is
gonna know that her daddy…

1137
01:28:49,345 --> 01:28:51,910
is not a piece of shit.

1138
01:29:00,681 --> 01:29:02,118
I'll come.

1139
01:29:05,895 --> 01:29:06,896
What?

1140
01:29:07,407 --> 01:29:09,344
You got something better to do?

1141
01:29:09,346 --> 01:29:10,347
Come on!

1142
01:29:12,683 --> 01:29:13,684
Pussies.

1143
01:29:49,445 --> 01:29:51,840
We think that thing's a weapon.

1144
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:52,888
Here. Lower.

1145
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:02,565
We gotta take out the big one.

1146
01:30:05,244 --> 01:30:09,016
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1147
01:30:09,876 --> 01:30:11,310
There’s a flooded tunnel ...

1148
01:30:11,315 --> 01:30:13,086
Leads right underneath that building.

1149
01:30:13,251 --> 01:30:17,790
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim underneath that things feet.

1150
01:30:17,797 --> 01:30:21,064
We get in its face and distract
the hell out of that son of a bitch.

1151
01:30:21,065 --> 01:30:22,544
So the swimmers can blow the bomb.

1152
01:30:24,133 --> 01:30:26,293
That’s how we take it out.

1153
01:30:36,482 --> 01:30:38,573
I’m going with ya.

1154
01:30:40,248 --> 01:30:41,249
We got this.

1155
01:30:41,713 --> 01:30:44,611
I’m not asking bro.

1156
01:30:47,272 --> 01:30:49,708
I live underground.

1157
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:52,473
Y’all are just tourist.

1158
01:31:10,065 --> 01:31:13,129
My dear husband if I die in battle.

1159
01:31:13,761 --> 01:31:16,693
We will be together.

1160
01:31:17,353 --> 01:31:20,341
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

1161
01:31:21,328 --> 01:31:23,754
His souls trapped inside of it.

1162
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:25,937
She talks to him.

1163
01:31:26,561 --> 01:31:27,562
Hey. Well ...

1164
01:31:28,094 --> 01:31:30,799
You know what they say
about the crazy ones.

1165
01:31:32,017 --> 01:31:33,018
Huh?

1166
01:31:40,624 --> 01:31:41,625
Let’s do this.

1167
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,320
You gonna fight with us?

1168
01:32:27,096 --> 01:32:28,631
What if I lose control?

1169
01:32:28,916 --> 01:32:30,985
Then maybe we’ll have a chance.

1170
01:32:43,854 --> 01:32:44,855
Duck in.

1171
01:32:57,323 --> 01:33:01,059
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff right?

1172
01:33:01,484 --> 01:33:02,485
Yeah why?

1173
01:33:03,221 --> 01:33:05,326
I’m off my meds.

1174
01:33:06,941 --> 01:33:08,610
That’s your old lady huh?

1175
01:33:08,935 --> 01:33:09,613
Yeah.

1176
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:11,844
Well, you need to handle this shit, alll right?

1177
01:33:11,845 --> 01:33:14,375
Get up there, smack on her ass,

1178
01:33:14,478 --> 01:33:16,035
tell her: "knock this shit off".

1179
01:33:16,057 --> 01:33:18,058
I do not think that’d be wise.

1180
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,126
I’m gonna draw out the big one.

1181
01:33:20,551 --> 01:33:23,233
My boys will detonate the bomb underneath him.

1182
01:33:27,114 --> 01:33:30,169
You know, we should
get a drink sometimes.

1183
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:32,740
I’ve been waiting for you all night.

1184
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:36,501
Step out of the shadows.

1185
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:39,258
I won’t bite.

1186
01:33:42,878 --> 01:33:44,480
What the hell? Grab her.

1187
01:33:46,467 --> 01:33:48,729
Why are you here?

1188
01:33:48,763 --> 01:33:51,769
Because the soldier led you?

1189
01:33:51,887 --> 01:33:53,690
And all for Waller?

1190
01:33:53,797 --> 01:33:56,826
Why do you serve those who cage you?

1191
01:33:56,889 --> 01:33:57,890
I am your ally.

1192
01:33:59,251 --> 01:34:02,022
And I know what you want.

1193
01:34:02,124 --> 01:34:05,153
Exactly what you want.

1194
01:34:46,664 --> 01:34:47,665
Baby. Baby.

1195
01:34:49,044 --> 01:34:52,340
Baby. It’s just a nightmare.

1196
01:34:52,966 --> 01:34:54,933
It’s just a bad dream.

1197
01:34:55,508 --> 01:34:56,509
I’m here.

1198
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:08,668
Miss me?

1199
01:35:15,855 --> 01:35:19,712
I’ll put the kids to sleep
and then we can kick in?

1200
01:35:20,918 --> 01:35:22,406
Yeah?

1201
01:35:24,376 --> 01:35:28,137
I can’t change what I did. And neither can you!

1202
01:35:28,138 --> 01:35:30,575
He married me.

1203
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:33,297
It’s not real.

1204
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:35,031
I killed the Bat.

1205
01:35:35,031 --> 01:35:36,812
No homie, you don’t want that.

1206
01:35:36,902 --> 01:35:38,759
What? I want that.

1207
01:35:38,785 --> 01:35:42,887
- She’s trying to play games with you man. It’s not real!
- He’s right.

1208
01:35:43,057 --> 01:35:44,513
It’s not real.

1209
01:35:46,898 --> 01:35:49,914
How long have you been able to see?

1210
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,959
My whole life.

1211
01:35:52,957 --> 01:35:54,892
You can’t have them.

1212
01:35:54,894 --> 01:35:56,450
These are my people right here.

1213
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:58,349
But it is our time.

1214
01:35:58,462 --> 01:36:01,175
The sun is setting and the magic rises.

1215
01:36:01,176 --> 01:36:03,578
The met humans are a sign of change.

1216
01:36:04,575 --> 01:36:05,576
Lady ...

1217
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:08,460
You are EVIL!

1218
01:36:09,127 --> 01:36:10,128
Brother.

1219
01:36:10,819 --> 01:36:12,153
Make them bow to me.

1220
01:36:13,079 --> 01:36:14,080
Oh wow!

1221
01:36:17,543 --> 01:36:18,544
Uh-oh!

1222
01:36:19,291 --> 01:36:20,292
Who's this?

1223
01:36:20,895 --> 01:36:22,288
It’s gonna be bad!

1224
01:36:22,289 --> 01:36:23,769
We should run.

1225
01:36:35,152 --> 01:36:37,116
GQ, come in. We’re in position.

1226
01:36:46,284 --> 01:36:48,742
We gotta get him in that corner
That’s where the bomb will be.

1227
01:36:48,747 --> 01:36:50,817
I'll do it! I'll get him there.

1228
01:37:04,529 --> 01:37:06,568
I lost one family.
I ain't gonaa lose one another.

1229
01:37:06,576 --> 01:37:07,799
Look, think it through ...

1230
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:09,011
I got this.

1231
01:37:09,497 --> 01:37:11,699
Let me show you what I really am.

1232
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:14,295
Over here!

1233
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:57,981
Go!

1234
01:38:12,044 --> 01:38:13,895
Rick, in position. Standing by.

1235
01:38:14,111 --> 01:38:16,020
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

1236
01:38:30,548 --> 01:38:32,282
Get him mate.
- Come on.

1237
01:38:33,629 --> 01:38:35,241
Yeah, do it.

1238
01:38:45,177 --> 01:38:47,410
Diablo, get clear
Get out of there!

1239
01:38:47,493 --> 01:38:48,958
Blow it!

1240
01:38:51,911 --> 01:38:53,278
Blow it.

1241
01:38:55,646 --> 01:38:56,647
Now GQ, now.

1242
01:38:56,984 --> 01:38:57,985
NO!

1243
01:38:59,779 --> 01:39:00,780
Everybody down!

1244
01:39:02,613 --> 01:39:04,644
Now you’re screwed.

1245
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,728
Brother!

1246
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:39,971
You next.

1247
01:39:41,914 --> 01:39:44,902
My spell is complete.

1248
01:39:45,037 --> 01:39:48,878
Once you and armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

1249
01:39:48,953 --> 01:39:52,759
And it would be mine to rule.

1250
01:40:07,673 --> 01:40:09,882
That was our main satellite uplink.

1251
01:40:14,627 --> 01:40:16,697
How did this witch even know how to target this thing?

1252
01:40:16,705 --> 01:40:18,725
It’s a secret facility.

1253
01:40:23,209 --> 01:40:24,944
You got a move here, Flag?

1254
01:40:25,078 --> 01:40:27,473
We gotta cut her heart out.

1255
01:40:58,305 --> 01:40:59,560
While we’re fighting ...

1256
01:40:59,562 --> 01:41:02,308
that thing is laying waste to the whole damn world.

1257
01:41:09,427 --> 01:41:10,428
Where is she?

1258
01:41:11,018 --> 01:41:12,018
I don’t know

1259
01:41:16,838 --> 01:41:17,839
Hey.

1260
01:41:24,492 --> 01:41:25,846
Look out look out!

1261
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:51,121
Sorry.

1262
01:41:56,977 --> 01:41:57,978
Flag!

1263
01:42:32,611 --> 01:42:34,282
Enough!

1264
01:42:37,523 --> 01:42:40,076
Of all who have faced me ...

1265
01:42:40,143 --> 01:42:42,916
you have earned mercy.

1266
01:42:42,995 --> 01:42:45,483
For the last time ...

1267
01:42:45,583 --> 01:42:47,395
join me ...

1268
01:42:47,507 --> 01:42:49,231
or die.

1269
01:42:50,903 --> 01:42:52,705
I’m not much of a joiner ...

1270
01:42:54,894 --> 01:42:57,239
but maybe we should.

1271
01:42:57,366 --> 01:42:58,831
Hey.

1272
01:42:58,832 --> 01:43:00,568
She’s trying to take over the world.

1273
01:43:00,569 --> 01:43:01,566
So?

1274
01:43:02,211 --> 01:43:04,492
What’s the world ever
done for us anyway?

1275
01:43:04,609 --> 01:43:05,836
It hates us.

1276
01:43:06,391 --> 01:43:08,441
Hey Harley!

1277
01:43:11,421 --> 01:43:13,288
Hey lady?

1278
01:43:15,766 --> 01:43:18,066
I lost my Puddin'.

1279
01:43:19,238 --> 01:43:21,518
But you can get him back, right?

1280
01:43:22,161 --> 01:43:24,398
I can, my dear.

1281
01:43:24,697 --> 01:43:27,766
Anything you want.

1282
01:43:30,462 --> 01:43:31,323
You promise?

1283
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,472
Yes. Child.

1284
01:43:35,095 --> 01:43:36,898
You need only Bow ...

1285
01:43:37,865 --> 01:43:41,857
and serve beneath my feet.

1286
01:43:46,409 --> 01:43:48,927
I like what you’re sellin' lady.

1287
01:43:49,677 --> 01:43:53,300
There’s only one teeny problem.

1288
01:43:54,421 --> 01:43:56,197
You messed with my friends.

1289
01:44:01,661 --> 01:44:03,996
Her heart’s out!
We can ends this.

1290
01:44:08,415 --> 01:44:09,416
Hey, Croc!

1291
01:44:13,047 --> 01:44:14,483
Harley!

1292
01:44:58,702 --> 01:45:01,226
Please Daddy, Don’t do it.

1293
01:45:02,345 --> 01:45:06,644
The only way for us to be together
is if you don’t pull the trigger.

1294
01:45:07,288 --> 01:45:09,034
Daddy I love you.

1295
01:45:09,872 --> 01:45:12,251
Please don’t do this.

1296
01:46:06,677 --> 01:46:08,099
That was a great shot man.

1297
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:10,505
Hey, I don’t do hugs. I’m not a hugger.

1298
01:46:10,506 --> 01:46:13,427
I’m not a hugger. All right?

1299
01:46:19,794 --> 01:46:22,495
Let me join my brother.

1300
01:46:23,406 --> 01:46:24,407
Katana, no!

1301
01:46:29,768 --> 01:46:30,769
Give me that.

1302
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,235
You bring June back.

1303
01:46:34,469 --> 01:46:35,608
You bring her back.

1304
01:46:35,736 --> 01:46:37,876
She's not coming back.

1305
01:46:38,105 --> 01:46:39,008
I'll crush this.

1306
01:46:39,135 --> 01:46:40,594
Do you hear me?

1307
01:46:40,736 --> 01:46:42,422
You bring June back or I'll crush this!

1308
01:46:42,584 --> 01:46:44,298
Go ahead.

1309
01:46:44,852 --> 01:46:47,066
You don't have the balls.

1310
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:41,187
Hey, Flag.

1311
01:47:50,707 --> 01:47:51,714
June!

1312
01:48:01,079 --> 01:48:02,858
She's gone.

1313
01:48:02,906 --> 01:48:04,498
I though killed you.

1314
01:48:04,658 --> 01:48:06,396
I thought I killed you.

1315
01:48:07,393 --> 01:48:12,699
Y'all don't mind.
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

1316
01:48:12,816 --> 01:48:15,266
Yeah, and I got some business
to handle back in Gotham.

1317
01:48:15,391 --> 01:48:16,845
I'm going to hotwire a car
Need a ride?

1318
01:48:16,874 --> 01:48:18,209
You are not driving.

1319
01:48:18,309 --> 01:48:19,310
Why not?

1320
01:48:22,197 --> 01:48:24,420
How are you not dead?

1321
01:48:24,811 --> 01:48:26,952
We just saved the world.

1322
01:48:27,468 --> 01:48:29,431
A "thank you" would be nice.

1323
01:48:29,779 --> 01:48:31,259
Thank you.

1324
01:48:31,829 --> 01:48:32,830
You're welcome.

1325
01:48:33,035 --> 01:48:35,037
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1326
01:48:35,292 --> 01:48:37,857
Ten years off you prison sentences.

1327
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:43,979
Nah. That's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1328
01:48:46,192 --> 01:48:47,689
That can be arranged.

1329
01:48:48,742 --> 01:48:50,500
Ant other requests?

1330
01:48:51,136 --> 01:48:53,006
An espresso machine.

1331
01:48:53,362 --> 01:48:55,251
BET.

1332
01:48:55,627 --> 01:48:58,521
Ten years off a triple life sentence?

1333
01:48:58,530 --> 01:49:00,435
Darling, I'm walking out of here
a free man..

1334
01:49:00,436 --> 01:49:02,443
Or we're to start having some real fun.

1335
01:49:02,444 --> 01:49:05,589
Why don't have some fun?

1336
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:17,306
You're trying to figure out this length.

1337
01:49:17,794 --> 01:49:19,162
That's the hypotenuse.

1338
01:49:19,603 --> 01:49:21,002
So you have to know this angle.

1339
01:49:21,242 --> 01:49:23,930
Okay. So, if you're up here ...

1340
01:49:23,955 --> 01:49:25,375
like an a building ...

1341
01:49:25,529 --> 01:49:28,809
And you shoot a man down here
an the street ...

1342
01:49:28,861 --> 01:49:31,155
That's how far the bullet actually goes?

1343
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:33,881
Yeah. That's ... that's right!

1344
01:49:34,092 --> 01:49:35,529
Tou are so smart, Right.

1345
01:49:35,533 --> 01:49:37,837
The hypotenuse, good one.

1346
01:49:38,957 --> 01:49:40,875
So that would make you
have to know the angle ...

1347
01:49:40,984 --> 01:49:43,415
Between the building and the sidewalk.

1348
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:45,147
You got to know that angle.

1349
01:49:45,148 --> 01:49:46,804
No, I mean, in real life ...

1350
01:49:46,805 --> 01:49:47,859
You have variables.

1351
01:49:47,921 --> 01:49:49,408
You know. You got rifling twist.

1352
01:49:49,409 --> 01:49:52,028
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1353
01:49:52,583 --> 01:49:56,546
Some shots you'll even have to take
the curvature of the earth in with the ...

1354
01:49:56,672 --> 01:49:58,085
It's time.

1355
01:49:59,357 --> 01:50:00,358
...Wind effect.

1356
01:50:02,144 --> 01:50:04,413
You know, there's a lot variables ...

1357
01:50:05,284 --> 01:50:06,984
In the street.

1358
01:50:10,530 --> 01:50:12,036
I gotta go.

1359
01:50:12,604 --> 01:50:13,938
Are you coming back?

1360
01:50:15,837 --> 01:50:16,837
Yeah.

1361
01:50:16,938 --> 01:50:19,571
I'm working it out. All right?

1362
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:24,443
You know, promised my friends
that i would just, you know, go ...

1363
01:50:24,444 --> 01:50:26,378
Without killing them all.

1364
01:50:26,462 --> 01:50:27,644
Bring in it.

1365
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:31,895
I love you. Daddy.

1366
01:50:34,754 --> 01:50:36,235
I love you.

1367
01:51:01,957 --> 01:51:04,741
Hey! Let me out!

1368
01:51:04,742 --> 01:51:06,667
Let me out of here right now!

1369
01:51:06,977 --> 01:51:10,154
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

1370
01:51:10,428 --> 01:51:14,077
Let me out of here. Darling, please.
Please, I'm begging you. Seriously.

1371
01:51:14,078 --> 01:51:17,411
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1372
01:51:17,521 --> 01:51:19,324
Come on!

1373
01:52:13,638 --> 01:52:15,481
Puddin"!

1374
01:52:17,607 --> 01:52:20,029
Let's go home.

1375
01:52:22,418 --> 01:52:25,784
Our channel ID: <font color="#ffff80">@SubElites</font>

1376

My E-mail address: <font color="#8080ff">aliakbar_1022@yahoo.com</font>
My Telegram ID: <font color="#0000ff">@Aliakbar99</font>

1377
01:52:33,668 --> 01:52:38,495
Listen, I can keep a secret, OK?
What do you want?

1378
01:52:38,496 --> 01:52:39,580
People have asked questions

1379
01:52:39,621 --> 01:52:40,990
about Midway City.

1380
01:52:41,118 --> 01:52:42,649
The kind of people can get the answers,

1381
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:45,849
And if they can get those answers, [?]

1382
01:52:46,152 --> 01:52:50,058
Consider yourself under my protection. If you deliver.

1383
01:53:06,638 --> 01:53:07,766
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1384
01:53:10,442 --> 01:53:11,753
It likes to make friends.

1385
01:53:13,805 --> 01:53:14,806
It's the difference between us

1386
01:53:14,848 --> 01:53:15,849
You believe in friendship.

1387
01:53:15,954 --> 01:53:17,035
I believe in the leverage.

1388
01:53:18,576 --> 01:53:19,577
Goodnight.

1389
01:53:19,696 --> 01:53:21,058
You look tired.

1390
01:53:21,652 --> 01:53:23,904
You should stop working at nights.

1391
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:28,754
You should shout it down,
or my friends and I will for you.
