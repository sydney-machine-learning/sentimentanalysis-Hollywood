2
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,640
Dad? It's me.

3
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,353
Dad?

4
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,279
There you are.

5
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,868
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

6
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,920
So, what happened?

7
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,755
Nothing.

8
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,383
- Oh, tell me.
- I just did. Nothing happened.

9
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,968
- Nothing happened?
- No.

10
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,719
I've just had her on the phone.

11
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,596
So? What does that prove?

12
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,473
You can't go on behaving like this.

13
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,892
It's my flat, isn't it?
This is incredible.

14
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,688
You burst in on me as if...
I've no idea who she is, this woman.

15
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,231
I never asked her for anything.

16
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,192
- She's here to help you.
- To help me do what?

17
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,696
I don't need her. I don't need anyone.

18
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,340
She told me
you'd called her a little bitch.

19
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,800
I don't know what else.

20
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,469
Maybe. I don't remember.

21
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,099
- She was in tears.
- Because I called her a little bitch?

22
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:47,311
No. She told me
that you'd threatened her physically.

23
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,229
Me?

24
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,064
Physically?

25
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,862
She has no idea
what she's talking about.

26
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,323
This woman is raving mad. Believe me.

27
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,033
Best if she does leave. Believe me.

28
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,160
Especially as...

29
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,620
As what?

30
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,542
I didn't wanna tell you this,
but since you must know,

31
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,669
I suspect she was...

32
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,339
- She...
- She was what?

33
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,841
- She was stealing from me.
- Angela?

34
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,636
What are you talking about?

35
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,846
I'm telling you, she stole my watch.

36
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,264
- Your watch?
- Yes. Yes.

37
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:28,435
- Isn't it more likely you just lost it?
- No. I already had my suspicions.

38
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,062
So I set a trap for her.

39
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,567
I left my watch somewhere in the open
to see if she'd pinch it or...

40
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,819
Where? Where did you leave it?

41
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,905
I don't know and I don't remember.

42
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,658
All I know is it's nowhere to be found.
I can't find it.

43
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,369
There's your proof.
That girl stole my watch. I know she did.

44
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,831
Yeah.

45
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,129
What's the matter?

46
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,135
I don't know what to do.

47
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,596
We have to talk, Dad.

48
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,349
That's what we're doing, isn't it?

49
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,434
No, I mean, seriously.

50
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,770
That's the third one you've...

51
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,607
I'm telling you,
I don't need her or anyone else.

52
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,901
I can manage very well on my own.

53
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,030
Wasn't easy to find her. This isn't easy.

54
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,993
She looked really good.
Lots of great qualities.

55
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,288
And now she doesn't want
to work here anymore.

56
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,623
You are not listening
to what I'm telling you.

57
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,376
That girl stole my watch.

58
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,046
I'm not going to live with a thief,
do you understand?

59
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,384
Have you looked under the bath?

60
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,721
- What?
- Under the bath by the pipes

61
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,056
- where you hide your valuables.
- How do you know that?

62
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,100
- Tell me the truth.
- I just know.

63
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,519
- Have you been looking in my hiding place?
- No.

64
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,564
Then how do you know
that's where I keep my valuables?

65
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,399
I found it by accident.

66
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,861
- You...
- Dad.

67
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,197
Dad!

68
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,490
Where are you going?

69
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,661
I haven't touched anything!

70
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,752
You found it, then?

71
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,379
- What?
- Your watch.

72
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,465
Oh, yes.

73
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,510
So you realize
Angela had nothing to do with it?

74
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,974
Only because I hid it,
luckily, just in time.

75
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,184
Otherwise I'd be sitting here,
talking to you

76
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,061
with no means of knowing what time it was.

77
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,565
It's five o'clock, if you're interested.

78
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,733
Myself, I am interested.

79
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,278
Pardon me for breathing.

80
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,284
- Have you had your pills?
- Yes.

81
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,121
Why do you look at me
as if something's wrong?

82
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,956
Everything is fine, Anne.

83
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,293
World is turning.

84
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,547
You've always been that way. A worrier.

85
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,675
Whereas your sister...

86
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,264
Where is she, by the way?
Have you heard from her?

87
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,393
I'm asking you a question.

88
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,778
I'm going to have to move, Dad.

89
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,282
I'm going to have to leave London.

90
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,118
Really?

91
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,036
Why?

92
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,747
We talked about this. Do you remember?

93
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,626
Is that why you're so keen
on this nurse living with me?

94
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,085
Obviously, it is.

95
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,379
The rats are leaving the ship.

96
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,725
I won't be here.

97
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:41,563
I won't be able to come here every day.
You need to understand that.

98
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:42,481
Yeah.

99
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,109
So you're leaving.

100
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,612
When? I mean, why?

101
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,074
I've met someone.

102
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,867
You?

103
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:54,868
Yes.

104
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,456
- You mean, a man?
- Yes.

105
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,499
Really?

106
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,544
You don't have to sound so surprised.

107
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,254
No, no, it's just that, I mean...

108
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,298
You have to admit that since...

109
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,177
- James?
- James.

110
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,597
There hasn't been a lot of...

111
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,143
- What does he do anyway?
- He lives in Paris.

112
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,604
So I'm going to go live there.

113
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,022
You in Paris?

114
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,401
You're not gonna do that, are you?

115
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,571
Wake up. They don't even speak English.

116
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,662
So, if I understand correctly,

117
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,248
you're leaving me.

118
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,207
Is that it?

119
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,460
You're abandoning me.

120
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,378
Dad.

121
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,677
What's going to become of me?

122
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,975
Obviously, this is very important to me,

123
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,852
otherwise I wouldn't be going.

124
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,105
I... I really love him.

125
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,735
And I can come back and see you often.

126
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,069
At the weekends.

127
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,532
But I can't leave you here
on your own. It's not possible.

128
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,701
That's why, if...

129
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,915
If you refuse to have a carer,
I'm going to have to...

130
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:23,832
To what?

131
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,001
To what?

132
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,715
You have to understand, Dad.

133
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,550
Anne?

134
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,428
You're going to have to what?

135
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,337
Anne?

136
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,966
Anne?

137
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,615
Is there anybody there?

138
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,142
Everything all right?

139
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:11,643
Who are you?

140
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,730
- Sorry?
- Who are you?

141
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:17,941
What are you doing here?

142
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,569
What are you doing in my flat?

143
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,949
Anthony, it's me, Paul.

144
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:26,867
Who?

145
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:28,952
What are you doing here?

146
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,372
I live here.

147
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,250
- You?
- Yes.

148
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,086
- You live here?
- Yes.

149
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,631
You live here in my flat?

150
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,675
Oh, that's the best yet.

151
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,345
What is this nonsense?

152
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:50,599
I'm gonna phone Anne.

153
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:54,937
Your daughter.

154
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,689
Yes, thank you. I know who Anne is.

155
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,234
Do you know Anne?
Are you a friend of hers?

156
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,611
I'm speaking to you!

157
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,531
Do you know Anne?

158
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,158
I'm her husband.

159
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,329
- Her husband?
- Yes.

160
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,165
Since when?

161
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,669
Coming up for ten years.

162
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,881
Ah, yes, yes.

163
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,050
Of course, yes, yes.

164
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,510
Obviously.

165
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,888
Ten years already? But I thought...

166
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,056
Aren't you...

167
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,642
- separated?
- Who?

168
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,520
- Anne and me?
- Yes, you aren't?

169
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,855
No.

170
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,314
Are you sure?

171
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,817
Yes, Anthony.

172
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,861
But this thing about France,

173
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,321
wasn't she supposed
to be going to Paris to...?

174
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,408
- Wasn't she...?
- Hello, darling. Yes, it's me.

175
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:53,036
No, it's just your father
isn't feeling very well.

176
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,621
I think he'd like to see you.

177
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,168
Fine. Don't be too long.

178
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,380
She's just doing some shopping.

179
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,423
She'll be...

180
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,217
- up in a minute.
- Oh, good.

181
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,261
She told me...

182
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,307
The other day she told me
she was going to go live in Paris.

183
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,600
- She told me.
- Paris?

184
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,352
- Yes.
- What was she going to do in Paris?

185
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,855
She met a Frenchman.

186
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,941
I don't think so, Anthony.

187
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,777
Yes, she did. She told me
the other day. I'm not an idiot.

188
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,782
She told me she was moving
to go and live with him. And...

189
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,285
I even remember telling her
it was a stupid idea

190
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,412
because they don't even speak English.

191
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,502
- You don't know about this?
- No.

192
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:43,879
What?

193
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,298
- Have I put my foot in it?
- Don't worry.

194
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,385
She hasn't mentioned it to me,
but I'm sure she's intending to.

195
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,388
- So you do know about the Frenchman?
- No.

196
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,723
Oops-a-daisy.

197
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,269
Never mind. Chin up!

198
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:03,649
They all end up leaving sooner or later.

199
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,192
I speak from experience.

200
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,529
Do you want something to drink
while we're waiting?

201
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,321
Glass of water? Fruit juice?

202
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,032
No, it's just, I was...

203
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,618
I was gonna say something.

204
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:23,961
Yeah. It's because of that girl,
that nurse.

205
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,546
- Laura?
- I've forgotten the name.

206
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,423
That girl your wife insists
on handing me over to.

207
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:31,885
You know about this.
As if I'm unable to manage on my own.

208
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:36,348
She told me, your wife told me
that I needed the help of this...

209
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,600
Even though I can manage
perfectly well on my own.

210
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:42,563
Even if she does have
to go abroad to Paris, your wife.

211
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:51,113
See, I don't understand
why she persists in...

212
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,908
Look at me. Just take a look at me.

213
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,371
- Paul.
- That's right, Paul.

214
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,249
Take a good look at me.
I can still manage on my own.

215
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,877
Don't you think?

216
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,046
I mean, I'm not completely...

217
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,050
You agree? Of course you agree.

218
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,178
But... her.

219
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:20,225
I don't know
where this stupid obsession comes from.

220
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,937
She's always been that way,
ever since she was little.

221
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,523
Thing is, she's not very bright.

222
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,443
You know, she's not very...

223
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:34,198
Not very intelligent.
She gets that from her mother.

224
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,201
I think she tries to do the best
she can for you, Anthony.

225
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,786
The best she can,
the best she can, yeah.

226
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,331
I never asked her for anything.

227
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,584
I don't know
what she's cooking up against me,

228
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,252
but she's cooking something up.

229
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:50,255
She's cooking something up,
that I do know.

230
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,300
I suspect she wants
to put me in a home for...

231
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,972
Yes, I've seen the signs.

232
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,435
But let me be absolutely clear.

233
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,355
I am not leaving my flat.

234
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,608
I am not leaving my flat!

235
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,697
- This isn't your flat, Anthony.
- Sorry?

236
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,617
If you remember, you moved here...

237
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,911
You moved to our place
while you were waiting...

238
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:21,828
For what?

239
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,997
For a new carer.

240
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,167
Because you quarreled
with the last one. With Angela.

241
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,210
Oh, did I?

242
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,921
That's why you're staying
in our place while you wait.

243
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,715
- So, James...
- Paul.

244
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,467
Right, Paul.

245
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,680
So you're telling me this is your place?

246
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,014
Yes.

247
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,351
Now I've heard everything.

248
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,480
- It's me.
- Ah, there she is.

249
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,068
What's happening?

250
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:57,072
Nothing much.
Your father seemed a bit confused.

251
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,365
Is something wrong?

252
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,203
What is this nonsense?

253
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,997
What are you talking about?

254
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,418
Where's Anne?

255
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:11,795
Sorry?

256
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,714
Anne. Where is she?

257
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,049
I'm here.

258
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,845
I just went down
to do some shopping. I'm back now.

259
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:25,893
Oh, I see.

260
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:33,400
What did you buy?

261
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,944
Chicken. Does that sound good?
Are you hungry?

262
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:37,529
Yes, why not?

263
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:41,783
Here, let me have it. I'll fix everything.

264
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:42,701
Thanks.

265
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,109
Paul said you weren't feeling very well.

266
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,363
I'm fine, thank you.

267
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,369
You look...

268
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,247
worried.

269
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,667
No, it's just...

270
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,629
Just what?

271
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,467
Hey.

272
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,555
Tell me.

273
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,184
I was making a cup of tea in the kitchen.

274
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,398
I was alone in the flat,
and suddenly I heard...

275
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:55,983
a noise.

276
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,152
Then I came in here
and there was your husband.

277
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,070
Who?

278
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,574
- Your husband.
- What husband?

279
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,492
Well, yours, my dear. Not mine.

280
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:06,577
James?

281
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,162
Your husband.

282
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,664
I'm not married, Dad.

283
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,082
I'm sorry?

284
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,336
I got divorced more than five years ago.

285
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,754
You remember.

286
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,134
- Well, then, who's he?
- Well, who?

287
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:28,223
Are you doing this on purpose?
Him who just left with the chicken.

288
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,643
- The chicken?
- You handed over a chicken a minute ago.

289
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,270
What are you on about?

290
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,397
Did you not hand over a chicken
to someone?

291
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,149
- The chicken!
- What chicken?

292
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,151
What are you talking about, Dad?

293
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,706
Well, he was here just now.

294
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,043
I think you're mistaken.
There's no one here.

295
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,962
- He's vanished.
- Who?

296
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,965
The man with the chicken?

297
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,258
Your husband!

298
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,511
Why are you smiling?

299
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,222
Nothing. I'm sorry. Sorry.

300
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,268
All this nonsense is driving me crazy.

301
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,461
What's the matter, Dad?

302
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,466
There's something funny going on.

303
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,428
Believe me,
there is something funny going on.

304
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,889
Come, sit down. Come on.

305
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,357
Now, don't worry.

306
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,569
Everything will sort itself out.

307
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:06,655
I don't know.

308
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,407
Yes, it will.

309
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,118
Don't worry.

310
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,289
Have you taken your medication?

311
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,083
What's that got to do with anything?

312
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,710
Let's give you your medication.

313
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,003
The evening dose.

314
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:23,046
Then you'll feel better.

315
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,050
It's been going on for some time.

316
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,387
Strange things going on around us.

317
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:31,930
Haven't you noticed?

318
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,187
There was this man claiming
this was not my flat.

319
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,066
A really unsympathetic-looking man.

320
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,985
A bit like your husband, only worse.

321
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:50,616
It's the best yet, don't you think?
In my flat. He told me.

322
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:57,831
But...

323
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:04,004
This is my flat.

324
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:05,589
Isn't it?

325
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,090
Anne?

326
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:10,802
Isn't it?

327
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,306
Tell me, Anne, this really is my flat.

328
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:17,267
Isn't it?

329
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:29,613
Thank you.

330
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:47,381
Yeah.

331
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,383
I know.

332
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,010
I know.

333
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,514
No. You can't imagine
how difficult it is sometimes.

334
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,516
The other day,
he didn't even recognize me.

335
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,434
I know.

336
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:01,603
Yeah.

337
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,355
Thank you.

338
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,693
As long as he likes her,
that's the main thing, isn't it?

339
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,362
And to know that he'll be happy.

340
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:12,698
Yeah.

341
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,619
No, that's a good idea. Yeah, absolutely.

342
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:18,662
Hope so.

343
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,248
She seemed nice on the phone.

344
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,546
Well, I'll let you know how it goes.

345
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,173
Yeah.

346
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,674
Okay.

347
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,218
Right, right.

348
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,263
Okay. Speak soon. Lots of love. Bye.

349
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,700
- Hello.
- Hello. I'm not too early, am I?

350
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,119
No, no, not at all. Come in.

351
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:00,370
- Come in.
- Thanks.

352
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,916
So come in.

353
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:05,709
- Thanks for coming around.
- That's okay.

354
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:10,339
My father's just in his room.
Would you like something to drink?

355
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,966
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Please make yourself comfortable.

356
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:14,468
I...

357
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,762
Yeah, so I was telling you,

358
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:20,098
- my father is upset by the whole idea...
- That's okay.

359
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:22,809
Yeah, so it can cause him to...

360
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,313
I think he's quite annoyed with me.

361
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:32,069
I'm just telling you this because
he is capable of reacting unexpectedly.

362
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,154
Has he lived on his own up till now?

363
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:37,616
Yes. He was in a flat not far from here.

364
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:38,909
Which worked.

365
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,453
And I was able to pop in on him
practically every day.

366
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,413
But we've had to come
to another arrangement.

367
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,041
- It wasn't viable anymore.
- I understand.

368
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:50,254
He's had several carers,
one after another.

369
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,924
He finds it difficult to get on with them.

370
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,092
He has his ways.

371
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,263
That's why I moved him in here with me.

372
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,724
But I'm finding it quite difficult
to manage on my own.

373
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:07,479
It's a bit much 'cause I have to work,
and that's why I need someone to help me.

374
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,440
- Did I hear the bell?
- Dad. Yes.

375
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,608
Ding-dong.

376
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,153
- I'd like you to meet Laura.
- How do you do, sir?

377
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:17,573
I explained to you
that Laura was going to come by today

378
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:18,824
so that you two could meet.

379
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,534
- Hello.
- Hello.

380
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,744
- I say, you're gorgeous.
- Thank you.

381
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:24,121
But I...

382
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,916
Haven't we met before?

383
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,585
No, I don't think so.

384
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:33,046
Are you sure? I have a distinct impression
that I've seen you before.

385
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,717
So Laura has come round to meet us

386
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,427
so she can get an idea of how you live

387
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,637
and to what extent
she might be able to help you.

388
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,849
I know, dear. I know that.
You've already told me a hundred times.

389
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:45,642
My daughter has...

390
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,687
a tendency to repeat herself.

391
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,772
But you know what it's like,
it's an age thing.

392
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,275
Would you like a drink?

393
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:54,776
You're very kind, but no, thanks.

394
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,320
An aperitif? Are you sure?

395
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:59,364
A little aperitif.
Time for an aperitif, no, no?

396
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,409
Just a moment, I'll be back.

397
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,913
He's going to find his watch.

398
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,959
- I must say, he's charming.
- Yeah. Not always.

399
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:25,015
Just as I thought, time for an aperitif!

400
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,601
I have two watches.
I've always had two.

401
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:30,062
One on my wrist and the other in my head.

402
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,563
It's always been that way.

403
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:35,025
- Now, what would you like, young lady?
- Dad.

404
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:38,946
I'm allowed to offer our guest a drink,
am I not? What will it be?

405
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,367
- What are you going to have?
- A small whiskey.

406
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,618
I'll have the same.

407
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,413
Splendid. Two small whiskies coming up.

408
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,624
Anne, please.

409
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,837
It's okay, Anne,
I'm not going to offer you a drink.

410
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,548
She never touches alcohol. Not a drop.

411
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:00,050
- It's true.
- Never. Not a drop, yeah.

412
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,345
That's why she seems so...

413
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,055
- So what?
- Sober.

414
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,517
Her mother was the same.
The soberest woman I've ever met.

415
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:12,646
Oh, dear.

416
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:14,231
Silly.

417
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,234
Whereas her little sister was
quite a different story.

418
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,527
You have two daughters?

419
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,696
Even though I hardly ever hear
from the other one.

420
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,031
All the same, she was always my favorite.

421
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,992
She was a painter. Look, there you are.

422
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,327
<i>The Pirouette.</i> Beautiful, isn't it?

423
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:28,495
Yes, it is.

424
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:29,830
Yes.

425
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:32,541
A dazzling girl.

426
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,544
I don't understand
why she never gets in touch. Never.

427
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:38,505
Your whiskey.

428
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,674
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

429
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,519
I'd give everything I own for a glass
of whiskey. Don't you agree?

430
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:54,938
Well, I don't own all that much, so...

431
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,191
Really? What do you do for a living?

432
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,778
I look after other people.

433
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:02,696
Other people?

434
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:06,533
Yeah, my job is to help people
who need help.

435
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,913
Sounds like those girls you're always
trying to dump off on me.

436
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,915
Must be a difficult job though, isn't it?

437
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,791
Spending all day with one of those...

438
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,752
I couldn't stand it. Am I right?

439
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,714
What about you?
What did you do for a living?

440
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,382
Oh, I was a dancer.

441
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:23,467
- Were you?
- Yes.

442
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,718
- Dad.
- What?

443
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,680
- You were an engineer.
- What do you know about it?

444
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,266
Yes, tap dancing was my specialty.

445
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,435
- Really?
- You seem surprised.

446
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,020
- A little bit.
- Why?

447
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,731
Don't you believe me,
or you find that difficult to imagine?

448
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,944
Of course. It's just...
I've always loved tap dancing.

449
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:45,197
You, really?
I'm still great at it. I'll show you.

450
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,287
Jolly good. Why are you laughing?

451
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,706
Sorry. Sorry.

452
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,792
I know who she reminds me of.

453
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:57,876
Who?

454
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,670
It's Lucy. Lucy, when she was younger.

455
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,588
- Lucy?
- Yeah, my other daughter.

456
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:04,007
That's right.
There is a resemblance, don't you think?

457
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,385
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yes.

458
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:08,929
Yes.

459
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,431
Her unbearable habit of laughing inanely.

460
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,021
I had you there, didn't I?

461
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,779
The situation is very simple.

462
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,865
I have lived in this flat...

463
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,200
for some time now.

464
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,619
I'm extremely attached to it.

465
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,749
I bought it more than 30 years ago.
Can you imagine? You weren't even born.

466
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,002
Yes, it's a big flat.

467
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,004
Very nice. It's very big.

468
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,465
And I've been very happy here.

469
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:51,805
Anyway,
my daughter is very interested in it.

470
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:53,098
What are you talking about?

471
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:57,811
You see, my daughter is of the opinion
that I cannot manage on my own.

472
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:00,731
So she's moved in with me,
ostensibly to help me,

473
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:05,777
with this man she met not long ago
just after her divorce.

474
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:06,820
Yeah.

475
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:10,199
Who has a very bad influence on her,
I have to tell you.

476
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:12,201
What are you talking about, Dad?

477
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:17,831
So now she would like to convince me
that I really cannot manage on my own.

478
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:22,252
And the next stage will be
to send me away. I don't know where.

479
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:26,381
It'll be a much more efficient way
of getting hold of my flat.

480
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:29,843
But it's not going to happen that way.

481
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:35,307
Sorry, dear. I may as well tell you now.

482
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,436
I'm not leaving this flat any time soon.

483
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:42,689
I'm going to outlive you.

484
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,275
Both of you.

485
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,693
I don't know about you...

486
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:48,946
but my daughter, yes.

487
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:53,200
In fact, I'm gonna make a point about it.

488
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:56,870
I'm going to inherit from her.
Not the other way around.

489
00:33:56,954 --> 00:34:00,582
And the day of her funeral,
I shall give a little speech.

490
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:04,545
To remind everyone how heartless
and manipulative she was.

491
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:06,046
I'm so sorry about this.

492
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:10,092
Why? She understands perfectly.
You're the one who doesn't.

493
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:13,053
See, I've been trying
to convince her for months

494
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:15,097
that I can manage very well on my own.

495
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,976
But... she refuses to listen.

496
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:23,938
I don't need any help from anyone.

497
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,734
And I'm not going to leave my flat.

498
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,946
All I want is for everyone to fuck off.

499
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,699
Having said that...

500
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,618
it's been a great pleasure.

501
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:38,911
Au revoir. Toodle-oo.

502
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,501
I'm really very sorry about this.

503
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,588
You weren't kidding
when you said he had his ways.

504
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,922
I'm really sorry.

505
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:54,636
Don't be.
That sort of reaction's quite normal.

506
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:58,307
It'll be all right.

507
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,100
Do you think?

508
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:07,191
Yeah.

509
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:01,722
Well?

510
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:03,765
What?

511
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,267
Did it go well?

512
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:08,103
Yeah.

513
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:11,315
I think so. She said
she was gonna start tomorrow.

514
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,150
- Here?
- Yeah.

515
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,067
Good.

516
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,987
Yeah. So we'll see
how the first day goes, and...

517
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:22,117
I was worried it wasn't gonna work,
but in the end, it was fine.

518
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,912
- He was charming.
- There you are, you see.

519
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:27,748
Yeah.

520
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,501
He really turned the charm on for her.
You should have seen him.

521
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:34,004
He told her he'd been a dancer.
A tap dancer.

522
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,048
- No.
- Yeah.

523
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:41,553
I don't know how to describe it to you.
She's going to be able to...

524
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:45,474
I think they're really
gonna get on well together.

525
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:49,645
And then he said
that she reminded him of Lucy.

526
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:51,980
Really?

527
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,234
How old is she?

528
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:57,444
Why, you interested?

529
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:10,290
What's the matter with you?

530
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:15,087
If it went well,
that's good news, isn't it?

531
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:17,005
Yes. Yeah.

532
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:18,715
So?

533
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:23,345
- What's the matter with you? Tell me.
- It's just...

534
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:25,222
What?

535
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,976
Just now, when I came back
with the chicken, he didn't recognize me.

536
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,479
It just did something to me.

537
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,525
I understand.

538
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,151
Finding it really hard.

539
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:41,238
Come, give me a hug.

540
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,495
I saw it in his eyes.
He didn't know who I was.

541
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:50,289
Like I was a stranger to him.

542
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:54,835
- You'll have to get used to it.
- I can't manage to.

543
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:58,005
I think you can.
I think you're managing really well.

544
00:38:59,047 --> 00:38:59,882
Come on.

545
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,221
Oh, Dad.

546
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:10,017
Hi. Dinner will be ready in five minutes.
Does that suit you?

547
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,728
Yes, dear. Suits me fine.

548
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,022
Suits me fine.

549
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:16,648
Hello.

550
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,027
Are you hungry?

551
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,363
Yes, yes. But...

552
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:26,742
We have guests this evening?

553
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:28,410
No, why?

554
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:31,121
Oh, nothing.

555
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:33,457
Nothing.

556
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,771
Everything all right?

557
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:58,857
You had a good day?

558
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,108
Yeah, very good.

559
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:02,277
Laura came by.

560
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:04,488
Didn't she, Dad?
Laura came by just now to see us.

561
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:06,490
- Who?
- Laura.

562
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,367
The young woman who came to see us.

563
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,580
Then we saw the doctor.

564
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,749
Has anyone seen my watch?
I seem to have lost it.

565
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:16,875
Again?

566
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:20,546
You've probably put it
in your cupboard. In your hiding place.

567
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:21,713
What cupboard?

568
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:25,092
I don't know what you're talking about.
I really don't know, Anne.

569
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:28,846
What cupboard? There's no cupboard.
There's no cupboard, is there?

570
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:31,640
Can we be more discreet?

571
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,141
Have you looked in your cupboard?

572
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:35,894
It's not there.
I must have lost it somewhere.

573
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:37,437
- Or it's been stolen.
- It hasn't.

574
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:38,730
What do you mean, it hasn't?

575
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:42,109
- It can't have flown away.
- You want me to go and have a look?

576
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,819
Very much so. It is a bother.

577
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:46,905
I am worried.
It's very worrying. I mean...

578
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:50,367
Losing all my things,
everyone's just helping themselves, and...

579
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,621
If this goes on much longer,
I'll be stark naked.

580
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:55,539
And...

581
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:59,710
I won't be able to tell
what time it is. Please.

582
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:00,794
Thank you.

583
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,081
Might you have the time?

584
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,460
Almost eight.

585
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,046
That's late.

586
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:47,716
Shouldn't we be sitting down for dinner?

587
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:50,511
Yes, in five minutes,
when the chicken's ready.

588
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,679
We're having chicken this evening?

589
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:54,848
It's the one Anne bought.

590
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:10,781
It's pretty.

591
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:12,991
Your watch, it's...

592
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:16,078
It's very pretty. It's...

593
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,580
Yeah. Is it yours?

594
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:23,001
I mean, is it yours?

595
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:24,586
Yes.

596
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,089
Might I see it?

597
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:30,217
So, apparently, it went very well today.

598
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,885
Oh, yes.

599
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,763
Very well. Very well.

600
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,767
Apparently, she looks like Lucy.

601
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:40,602
Really?

602
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,230
I don't know. I've never seen her.

603
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,357
No, it...

604
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,903
It went well. Anne seemed pleased.
You know, it's...

605
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:53,282
I don't really need...
It's mainly for Anne.

606
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:56,618
Might I have a look at it?
See your watch?

607
00:42:56,702 --> 00:43:00,789
You're right, you know,
it's important to her this works out.

608
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:01,874
Yeah.

609
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,960
She's been worried about you.

610
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:07,212
And it really upsets her

611
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:09,798
when you keep falling out with...

612
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:14,678
- What is it about my watch?
- Nothing.

613
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:17,014
I was just looking.

614
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,473
I want to check it's...

615
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:22,394
Check if it's... It's pretty. Very pretty.

616
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:25,314
Did you buy it?

617
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:26,315
Sorry?

618
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:29,526
Was it a present or did you buy it?

619
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,485
I bought it.

620
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,196
Why?

621
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:35,324
I don't suppose you kept the receipt?

622
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,492
What are you talking about?

623
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:40,495
- Your watch. It's...
- I was talking about Anne.

624
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:43,123
Anne?

625
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,918
Yes, Anne.

626
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:47,878
Yeah.

627
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:16,573
I don't know why we never really
got on well together.

628
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:20,536
Whereas her little sister...

629
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:23,705
That was another story.

630
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:28,794
Do you know her? She's marvelous.

631
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:30,671
Marvelous.

632
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:33,423
I haven't seen her for months.

633
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,011
I can't blame her, she's...

634
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:41,265
travelling around the world, I think.

635
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:43,267
She's a painter.

636
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:49,606
I'd be so happy
if she came to see me one day.

637
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:56,280
I'd take her in my arms
and we'd be glued to one another.

638
00:44:57,739 --> 00:44:59,950
For hours on end, like we used to be.

639
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,536
A long time ago, when she was little.

640
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,250
When she still used to call me:

641
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:10,335
"Little Daddy."

642
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:13,046
"Little Daddy."

643
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:14,548
Now, that's...

644
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,886
That's what she used to call me.

645
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:22,014
Nice, isn't it? "Little Daddy."

646
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:27,561
Can I ask you a question?

647
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,399
But I want an honest answer.

648
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,776
Nothing fancy.

649
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:37,362
Can you do that for me?

650
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:38,906
Yeah.

651
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:42,701
Well, then...

652
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:52,002
How long do you intend to hang around here
getting on everybody's tits?

653
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:03,764
What is it?

654
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,350
What have you done to your hair?

655
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:10,020
- Nothing. Why?
- You're looking good.

656
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,420
- You lost your keys?
- No.

657
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:51,687
Hello. My father has
an appointment with Dr. Sarai.

658
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,148
Dad, come here.

659
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:06,451
Okay, thank you.

660
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:08,495
So it's you who signs there.

661
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:11,665
I can fill in these.

662
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:14,543
Date of birth?

663
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:18,005
Friday, 31st of December, 1937.

664
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:20,048
- Friday?
- Yes.

665
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,427
You're living with your daughter
at the moment, is that right?

666
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,929
Yes. Until she goes to live in Paris.

667
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,557
No, Dad, why do you keep
going on about Paris?

668
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:31,393
- What?
- I'm staying in London.

669
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:36,273
You keep changing your mind.
How do you expect people to keep up?

670
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:38,317
Never been any question
of me living in Paris.

671
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,319
- Yes, there was. You told me.
- No, I didn't.

672
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:42,196
I'm sorry. You told me the other day.

673
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,907
Have you forgotten? She's forgotten.

674
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:48,744
You're suffering from memory loss.
I'd have a word with the doctor.

675
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:51,830
- In any event, I'm not going to Paris.
- That's good.

676
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:54,458
Paris. They don't even
speak English there.

677
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:13,227
I know how worrying these things can be,
and things can change very quickly.

678
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,939
So if you need anything at all,
give me a call. Any time.

679
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:19,149
Thank you. Thank you for your help.

680
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:52,766
Dad?

681
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:41,083
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

682
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:42,459
Thank you.

683
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,257
Hello. What's the matter?

684
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:50,300
What?

685
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:54,221
All right. I'll be up in a minute.

686
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:58,934
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

687
00:50:59,017 --> 00:50:59,852
Sorry.

688
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:06,191
What's happening?

689
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,279
Nothing much,
but I think he'd like to see you.

690
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:12,447
- Where is he?
- In his room.

691
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:14,700
- Let me have it.
- Thank you.

692
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:42,477
Here, let me.

693
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:45,230
What have you done?

694
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,292
What's the matter?

695
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:06,752
Nothing.

696
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:13,300
Okay. I'll get dinner ready.

697
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:15,385
Anne?

698
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:18,555
- What?
- Thank you for everything.

699
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:14,361
- We have to find another arrangement.
- Such as?

700
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:16,280
- Putting him in an institution.
- A home?

701
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:17,990
Yes, a nursing home.

702
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:20,033
It'd be better for him.

703
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:23,871
Why are you saying this now?
Tomorrow we've got this girl starting.

704
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,330
You're right.

705
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:28,667
We'll see. Maybe it'll work out
very well with this girl.

706
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,043
You seem to think she's good.

707
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,379
But, believe me, the doctor is right.

708
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:37,134
The moment will come when...
However good she is, he's ill, Anne.

709
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:39,011
He's ill.

710
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:44,224
Dad, what are you doing
standing out there? Come on.

711
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,562
Come on. Come and sit down.

712
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:51,023
Come on, Dad.

713
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:07,789
Okay.

714
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:21,929
- So it went well today?
- Yeah. Very well. Wouldn't you agree, Dad?

715
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:26,225
- What?
- You made her laugh a lot.

716
00:54:27,518 --> 00:54:29,478
- I did?
- Yes, she said you were charming.

717
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:32,105
That you had your ways,
but that you were charming.

718
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:34,775
She's coming tomorrow morning
to start working here.

719
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:39,279
- Would you like some more?
- I would. It's good chicken.

720
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:43,033
Don't you think? Where did you buy it?

721
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:44,326
Downstairs. Why?

722
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:47,287
No reason. It's good chicken.

723
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:49,039
Paul?

724
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:50,624
No, thanks.

725
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:55,963
So she's working full days,
is she? I mean...

726
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:57,589
Yeah, till six.

727
00:54:58,382 --> 00:54:59,883
- And then?
- What do you mean?

728
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:01,510
- After six?
- I'll be here.

729
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,641
You satisfied?

730
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:09,476
With what?

731
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,603
You have a daughter
who looks after you properly.

732
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:14,273
Don't you? You're lucky.

733
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,775
- You're lucky too.
- Oh, you think so?

734
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:25,617
- What's the matter with her?
- Anne?

735
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:28,328
She's tired.

736
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:30,664
Needs a bit of sun.

737
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:32,374
Aye.

738
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,919
You need to take care of her, old sport.

739
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,255
Why don't you go away somewhere?

740
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:41,842
Why?

741
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,971
Sometimes I wonder
if you're doing it deliberately.

742
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:48,140
What?

743
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,351
Nothing.

744
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:57,024
We had...

745
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:00,694
planned on going to Italy.

746
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:04,323
But we had to cancel at the last moment.

747
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:06,033
- Do you know why?
- No.

748
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,619
Because of your row with Angela.

749
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:11,663
We weren't able to go
and leave you on your own.

750
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:16,168
We had to cancel our holiday
and bring you here.

751
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:19,129
Now you're gonna stay here.

752
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,674
For good, if I understand correctly.

753
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:24,551
He's forgotten.

754
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:27,262
- It's amazing.
- Stop it.

755
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:30,224
- Stop what?
- You're being a bit...

756
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:32,392
- A bit what?
- Sarcastic.

757
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:35,103
No, I'm not.

758
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:38,899
I think I'm being very, very patient.
Very patient, believe me.

759
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:43,362
- Did you take the chicken away?
- Sorry, yes. Did you want some more?

760
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:45,864
- Is it in the kitchen?
- Yeah, I'll fetch you some more.

761
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:47,199
No, I'll get it.

762
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,841
- Why do you say things like that?
- What did I say?

763
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:07,427
I completely understand your feelings.

764
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:11,431
- No, you don't understand.
- I do. But what I don't understand is...

765
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:15,227
You do so much for him,

766
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,021
and I respect you for that.

767
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:21,525
I mean, you took the decision
to bring him here and...

768
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:24,069
You know, why not? But...

769
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:28,240
How can I put this?

770
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:31,618
I think you have to come up
with a different solution.

771
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:33,912
- He's totally lost it.
- Stop talking like that.

772
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:36,707
How do you want me to talk?
I'm telling the truth.

773
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:39,501
We have to come up
with a different arrangement.

774
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:42,212
- Such as?
- Put him in an institution.

775
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:45,757
- A home?
- Yes, a nursing home.

776
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:50,804
It'll be better for him.

777
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:55,225
Why are you saying this now?
Tomorrow we've got this girl starting.

778
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:56,768
Yes, you're right. We'll see.

779
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:58,812
Maybe it'll work out
very well with this girl.

780
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:00,147
You seem to think she's good.

781
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,858
But, believe me, the doctor's right, Anne.

782
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:07,487
The moment will come when...
However good she is, he's ill, Anne.

783
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:08,614
He's ill.

784
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,328
What are you doing standing out there?
Come and sit down.

785
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:17,497
Come on, Dad.

786
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,166
Dad, come in and sit down.

787
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:22,753
Dad.

788
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:58,473
<i>Please hold the line
while we try to connect you.</i>

789
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:01,476
<i>The number you are calling knows
you are waiting.</i>

790
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:13,572
<i>Please hold the line
while we try to connect you.</i>

791
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:16,116
<i>The number you are calling knows
you are waiting.</i>

792
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,460
<i>Dr. Sarai speaking.</i>

793
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:32,841
<i>Hello?</i>

794
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:37,262
<i>Hello?</i>

795
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:25,227
Dad?

796
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:27,312
Are you up already?

797
01:01:30,274 --> 01:01:31,441
Did you sleep well?

798
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:37,865
Anne, where are these from?

799
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,034
Shall I get you some tea
before she arrives?

800
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,588
- Where's the painting?
- What painting?

801
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:54,590
Lucy's.

802
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:58,927
You're mixing this up with your flat.
There's never been a painting there.

803
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:01,138
Come and have some breakfast.

804
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:05,684
Anne.

805
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:07,227
Look.

806
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:08,854
See.

807
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:14,693
Anne?

808
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,073
Here's your tea.

809
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:24,745
- What?
- Don't let it get cold.

810
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:28,665
- Where's Anne?
- She went out.

811
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:32,211
- Really? Already?
- Yeah.

812
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:37,758
She'll be back. At the end of the day.
I'll look for your medication.

813
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:38,884
- No, wait.
- I'll be back.

814
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,928
I'm just going to look
for your medication.

815
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:49,478
Oh, shit.

816
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:01,823
- What is the time?
- It's time for your medication.

817
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:04,535
It's best to take them now.
Then it's done. Don't you think?

818
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:08,914
This little blue one,
that's the one you like.

819
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:12,417
Your little blue pill.
Look, it's a pretty color, isn't it?

820
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:15,546
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

821
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:18,632
Are you a nun?

822
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:20,175
No.

823
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:23,512
Then why are you speaking to me
as if I'm retarded?

824
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:25,806
- Me?
- Yes.

825
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:28,141
- But I'm not.
- "Your little blue pill."

826
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:29,351
"Your little blue pill."

827
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:32,855
- Yeah.
- Sorry. I didn't mean...

828
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:34,606
It's really unpleasant.

829
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,818
You'll see when you get to my age,
which will happen sooner than you think.

830
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:39,528
I apologize.

831
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:41,655
It won't happen again.

832
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:46,410
Tell me...

833
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:50,122
have you noticed something?

834
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:51,707
What about?

835
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:55,627
- Well, you know, my flat.
- What about it?

836
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:57,838
Well, it's changed.

837
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:58,964
You think?

838
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:00,924
Yes.

839
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,635
Those chairs, for instance.

840
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:05,596
There, there.

841
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:09,850
- Who put them there?
- I don't know. Your daughter, I imagine.

842
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,935
Obviously my daughter, obviously.

843
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:17,566
All the same, it is extraordinary
not even to ask my opinion.

844
01:04:22,738 --> 01:04:25,449
I wanted to apologize if I was a little...

845
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:28,327
- the last time we met.
- No problem.

846
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,872
Your daughter warned me.
She told me you had your ways.

847
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:36,126
Yeah.

848
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:43,717
It is amazing how much you look like Lucy.

849
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:53,810
Anne told me what happened to her.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

850
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:57,022
- What?
- About her accident.

851
01:04:58,357 --> 01:04:59,358
What accident?

852
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:02,236
What?

853
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:04,738
What are you talking about?

854
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:07,783
Nothing.

855
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,957
Are you taking your medication?
Then we'll go get dressed.

856
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,291
- You see?
- What?

857
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:19,545
You're speaking to me
as if I were retarded.

858
01:05:19,628 --> 01:05:21,547
- No, I'm not.
- You are!

859
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:22,548
I'm not.

860
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:23,799
- Yeah.
- I...

861
01:05:23,882 --> 01:05:26,426
"And we'll get dressed."
"And your little blue pill."

862
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,555
Thing is, I'm very intelligent.
You need to bear that in mind.

863
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:31,431
Do you understand?

864
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:33,976
Yes, I'll bear that in mind.

865
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:37,396
Good. Thank you.

866
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:41,608
Yeah, it's true. I'm very intelligent.

867
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:44,862
Sometimes I even surprise myself.

868
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:50,617
I have a memory like an elephant.

869
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:57,165
- You know that animal?
- Yes, yes.

870
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:03,422
You've forgotten your pills.

871
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:05,424
What are they doing there?

872
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:09,136
- Shall I get you another glass of water?
- No, don't bother.

873
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:13,098
I'll swallow them with...
You'll see, that cup of tea.

874
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,601
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, positive. Look here.

875
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:18,979
You'll see. Are you watching?

876
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:21,565
- Yes.
- Watch carefully. Okay?

877
01:06:22,232 --> 01:06:23,525
I put them in my gob.

878
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,739
- Watch carefully.
- Yes, I'm watching.

879
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:29,823
Good.

880
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:31,658
Nice cup of tea.

881
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:33,660
Hey, presto.

882
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,001
Job is done.

883
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:42,544
- Bravo.
- Yeah.

884
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:44,713
You know...

885
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:49,760
I worked in a circus a bit
when I was young.

886
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:51,803
- Did you?
- Yes.

887
01:06:52,513 --> 01:06:56,683
- Would you like me to show you some magic?
- Why don't we get dressed first?

888
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:57,809
- Now?
- Yes.

889
01:06:57,893 --> 01:06:58,977
- No, not now.
- Yes!

890
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:00,145
- No.
- Yes.

891
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:01,772
Why? What's the point?

892
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:05,275
I'll only have to put
my pajamas back on again.

893
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,695
- Might as well save some time.
- I see what you mean.

894
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:12,866
But... if you stay in your pajamas,
we can't go out.

895
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:14,701
Where do you wanna go?

896
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:16,912
- Park.
- Oh, God.

897
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:19,331
- It's a nice day.
- Everything all right?

898
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:23,210
- Fine. We're going to get dressed.
- But...

899
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:26,380
Everything all right, Anthony?

900
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:28,340
Something the matter?

901
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:30,384
No, no.

902
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:34,555
I just wanted to have
a word with you, in fact.

903
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,765
- With me?
- Yes.

904
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:39,893
- I'll go pack up our things.
- No, don't go.

905
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:42,104
- I'll be back.
- Don't leave me on my own.

906
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:44,106
I'll be in the next room.
I'll be right back.

907
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:52,197
Can I ask you a question?

908
01:07:57,327 --> 01:07:58,287
Yeah.

909
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:01,498
But I want an honest answer.
Nothing fancy. Can you do that for me?

910
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:04,835
Yeah.

911
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:06,670
Well, then...

912
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:11,258
How much longer
do you intend to hang around

913
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:14,136
getting on everybody's tits?

914
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:17,973
- Who, me?
- Yes, you. I'd like to know your opinion.

915
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:22,227
I mean, do you intend
to go on ruining your daughter's life?

916
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,645
Or is it too much to hope
you might behave reasonably

917
01:08:25,104 --> 01:08:26,356
in the foreseeable future?

918
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:29,193
- What are you talking about?
- About you, Anthony.

919
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:31,653
About you. Your attitude.

920
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:33,822
Stop that. I won't allow this.

921
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:35,657
- Won't allow it?
- No.

922
01:08:35,741 --> 01:08:37,910
Suppose I do it again,
then what will you do?

923
01:08:37,993 --> 01:08:39,661
- I...
- Yeah?

924
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:41,997
You'll have to take me on, physically.

925
01:08:42,497 --> 01:08:44,291
Are you saying that to tempt me?

926
01:08:44,374 --> 01:08:47,294
See, me as well,
there's something I won't allow.

927
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:50,171
Getting on everybody's tits.
Past a certain age.

928
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:52,966
No, stop that. Stop that.

929
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:56,553
Yeah. I won't put up with that.
I find that totally inappropriate.

930
01:08:56,636 --> 01:08:58,430
Stop it. Stop it.

931
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:07,689
Dad, what's happened?
What's the matter with him?

932
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:09,566
Dad.

933
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:12,528
It's okay. Is it about your watch?

934
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:15,613
Is that the reason? I found it, look.

935
01:09:15,697 --> 01:09:17,950
It's okay. Oh, don't cry.

936
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:21,745
Don't cry.
You'll be all right now. It'll be okay.

937
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:23,705
You'll be all right.

938
01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:28,669
Let's eat our chicken, shall we?
You like chicken, don't you?

939
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:32,631
What time is it?

940
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:34,841
It's eight o'clock. Time to eat.

941
01:09:37,845 --> 01:09:39,595
Eight o'clock in the evening?

942
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,765
I thought it was morning.

943
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:47,104
I've only just got up.
Look, I'm still in my pajamas.

944
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:50,983
No, it's the evening,
and I've cooked you a chicken.

945
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:52,276
Oh, Dad.

946
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:54,027
It's okay. Come on.

947
01:09:54,111 --> 01:09:56,530
Come on, baby. Come on.

948
01:09:57,281 --> 01:09:58,991
Little Daddy, it's okay.

949
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:06,623
Little Daddy.

950
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:30,165
Dad?

951
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:34,002
Dad, are you asleep?

952
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:35,838
Anne?

953
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:38,257
Anne?

954
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:45,138
Dad, it's me.

955
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:48,976
Lucy?

956
01:12:15,711 --> 01:12:16,545
Dad?

957
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:43,280
Dad.

958
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:01,215
Lucy?

959
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:29,618
Dad.

960
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,164
Dad?

961
01:14:16,874 --> 01:14:17,958
Are you up already?

962
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:22,129
Shall I get you some tea
before she arrives?

963
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:39,563
Dad.

964
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:41,899
- Good morning.
- Sit down. It's ready.

965
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:43,567
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

966
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:46,695
You've got a visitor today.
Do you remember?

967
01:14:47,571 --> 01:14:48,530
Do you remember?

968
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:51,783
How could I forget?
You never stop talking about it.

969
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:53,619
She shouldn't be long.

970
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:56,371
- This early?
- Yeah.

971
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:00,501
- I dreamt about her last night.
- Laura?

972
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:02,211
Yes. Well, I think I did.

973
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:03,545
I could see her face.

974
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:05,172
You know, I...

975
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:08,342
She really reminded me of your sister.

976
01:15:10,093 --> 01:15:11,803
Yes, you said that yesterday.

977
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:14,681
Well, if you're happy, I'm happy.

978
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:16,517
She seems really nice.

979
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,227
- Sweet and efficient.
- Yeah.

980
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,395
I think she'll look after you well.

981
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:22,856
- I like her.
- Good.

982
01:15:25,776 --> 01:15:27,986
We should get you dressed
before she arrives.

983
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:31,865
- Who?
- Laura, your new carer, the one you like.

984
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,785
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.

985
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:36,370
Yes.

986
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:38,330
We'll get a jacket on you
before she arrives.

987
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:39,373
And trousers.

988
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:41,583
Yes.

989
01:15:42,543 --> 01:15:44,670
She said she really enjoyed
meeting you yesterday.

990
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:47,965
You did quite a little number on her.

991
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:49,466
- I did?
- Yes.

992
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,301
You convinced her
that you knew how to dance

993
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:53,136
and you were really good at tap dancing.

994
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,806
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

995
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:58,767
And what did she say?

996
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:01,603
She said she hoped you'd give her
a demonstration one day.

997
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:04,064
That's funny.

998
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:08,485
I didn't know I knew
how to tap-dance. Did you?

999
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:09,403
No.

1000
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:13,490
- Hidden talents.
- Apparently, yes.

1001
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:18,620
- Is that her?
- I expect so.

1002
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:20,664
But I'm not ready. I'm not even dressed.

1003
01:16:21,164 --> 01:16:24,084
- Never mind. You can get dressed later.
- No, wait. I'm not even...

1004
01:16:24,168 --> 01:16:25,752
- I must get dressed.
- It doesn't matter.

1005
01:16:25,836 --> 01:16:27,212
It does matter!

1006
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:30,424
- She's outside the door.
- Don't leave me alone. Look...

1007
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:32,384
What will she think of me?

1008
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:34,469
I've gotta be properly dressed.

1009
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:36,430
Why do you have
to make everything difficult?

1010
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:38,515
You can get dressed later.
Don't worry about it.

1011
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,058
- I'll be mortified!
- No, you won't.

1012
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:40,976
I will.

1013
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:45,564
- Laura, hello.
- Hello. I'm not too early, am I?

1014
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:48,233
No, no, not at all. Come in.
We're just in the kitchen.

1015
01:16:49,026 --> 01:16:51,028
- Here we are. About to get dressed.
- Hi.

1016
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:59,119
- Anne, who's this?
- Hello, Anthony.

1017
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:03,207
But, Anne, it's not her.

1018
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,124
Dad.

1019
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:07,044
Would you like something to drink,
some coffee or...?

1020
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:08,712
- No, thanks.
- Have you had breakfast?

1021
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,422
- I'm fine.
- I...

1022
01:17:10,506 --> 01:17:13,008
I don't want her. Where's the one I like?

1023
01:17:13,091 --> 01:17:15,344
What are you talking about?
Say hello to Laura.

1024
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:20,599
There's something
doesn't make sense about this.

1025
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:24,978
- It doesn't make sense.
- Remember me? We met yesterday.

1026
01:17:25,687 --> 01:17:28,690
We were just starting
to get to know one another.

1027
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:30,150
I said I'd come back,

1028
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:32,694
just to see how you do things here

1029
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:35,239
and see if I can help you.

1030
01:17:36,156 --> 01:17:37,324
Do you remember?

1031
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:05,060
Dad? Can I talk to you?

1032
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:13,277
How shall I put this?

1033
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:20,367
Do you remember the first time
you came to stay with me? It was just...

1034
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:23,954
It was a stopgap because you'd
fallen out with Angela and...

1035
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:28,834
I was wondering if it might be better...

1036
01:18:31,712 --> 01:18:33,881
What do you think of this room?
It's nice, isn't it?

1037
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:37,342
- You can see the park.
- Can you?

1038
01:18:43,557 --> 01:18:44,850
It's very nice.

1039
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:50,063
It's a bit like being in a hotel,
don't you think?

1040
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:51,815
All the residents say so.

1041
01:18:57,154 --> 01:19:00,199
I think you'd be better off here.

1042
01:19:02,284 --> 01:19:03,118
Where?

1043
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:05,370
Here.

1044
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:09,917
I think it'd be more reassuring
and nicer for you

1045
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,212
if we came to a joint decision
about you living here.

1046
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:15,714
What do you think?

1047
01:19:18,175 --> 01:19:21,345
Well, what about you?
What would you do? Where...?

1048
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:25,265
Where would you sleep? Which room?

1049
01:19:25,349 --> 01:19:28,519
Well, if you remember,
I'm gonna go and live in Paris.

1050
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:32,898
No, you're not.

1051
01:19:34,525 --> 01:19:35,651
I am. Remember?

1052
01:19:35,734 --> 01:19:37,778
I told you all about it. Remember?

1053
01:19:38,737 --> 01:19:39,738
But you said...

1054
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:42,533
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1055
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:47,037
But you told me...

1056
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,665
you were staying here with me.

1057
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:53,293
No, I have to go. It is important.

1058
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:55,003
I explained it all to you.

1059
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:57,673
I'll come back and see you,
occasional weekends.

1060
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:04,221
What about me?

1061
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:09,893
You're going to stay here in London.

1062
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:12,354
All on my own?

1063
01:20:14,273 --> 01:20:17,359
- What about your sister? Where is she?
- Oh, Dad.

1064
01:20:18,318 --> 01:20:20,529
If you only knew how much I miss her.

1065
01:20:22,114 --> 01:20:25,325
I do too. I miss her too, Dad.
We all miss her.

1066
01:22:58,061 --> 01:22:58,896
Anne?

1067
01:23:26,048 --> 01:23:26,965
Sleep well?

1068
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,510
What am I doing here?

1069
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:31,929
It's time.

1070
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:35,265
I didn't ask about the time.
I asked you what I was doing here.

1071
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:36,558
Where's Anne?

1072
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:39,019
I've brought you your medication.

1073
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:41,939
Why don't you just fuck off
with your medication?

1074
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:43,732
- Are you a nurse?
- Yeah.

1075
01:23:43,815 --> 01:23:46,610
Oh, you are. Oh, I see. That's it.

1076
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:48,403
You are a nurse.

1077
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:49,363
Yes.

1078
01:23:49,446 --> 01:23:52,533
That's what I was thinking.
You're the type. Typical nurse.

1079
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:54,451
So, what are you doing here?

1080
01:23:55,077 --> 01:23:57,704
- Sorry?
- What are you doing here?

1081
01:23:57,788 --> 01:23:59,122
I'm looking after you.

1082
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:02,876
You don't say, really? Looking after me?

1083
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,170
Well, first I've heard of it.

1084
01:24:06,797 --> 01:24:07,965
Since when?

1085
01:24:08,757 --> 01:24:10,008
Quite a few weeks now.

1086
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:11,969
Oh, a few weeks now?

1087
01:24:13,095 --> 01:24:14,221
Happy to hear it.

1088
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:18,308
Amazing. Nobody ever tells me
anything in this house.

1089
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:21,895
- I thought we were getting a new one.
- A new what?

1090
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:24,815
Nurse. A new nurse.

1091
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:28,193
The one who looks a bit like Lucy,
my other daughter.

1092
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:31,738
I met her the other day.
She came here, didn't she?

1093
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:33,699
Will you take your medication?

1094
01:24:34,283 --> 01:24:37,119
She was supposed to start this morning.

1095
01:24:37,202 --> 01:24:38,871
Laura. Wasn't she?

1096
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:41,874
I think you're mixing things up, Anthony.

1097
01:24:41,957 --> 01:24:44,459
The one who reminds me of Lucy.

1098
01:24:45,544 --> 01:24:46,920
- Right.
- Right.

1099
01:24:47,713 --> 01:24:49,590
Time to take our medication.

1100
01:24:50,674 --> 01:24:51,508
Yeah.

1101
01:24:52,134 --> 01:24:53,719
Not timed by the minute, is it?

1102
01:25:01,018 --> 01:25:01,935
Where is Anne?

1103
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:05,397
Your daughter isn't here, Anthony.

1104
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:09,902
- Where is she? Has she gone out?
- If you remember,

1105
01:25:10,569 --> 01:25:12,070
she lives in Paris.

1106
01:25:13,488 --> 01:25:14,990
No. Oh, no, no, no.

1107
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:19,369
She thought about going...

1108
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:21,872
but in the end, it didn't happen.

1109
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:25,751
She's been there several months now.

1110
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:28,670
My daughter, in Paris?

1111
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:31,256
No, no, no. They don't even speak English.

1112
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:32,174
Look.

1113
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:38,096
Yesterday, this postcard she sent you,
we read it together.

1114
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,224
Do you remember? Look.

1115
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:45,354
I tell you this every day.

1116
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:48,148
She lives in Paris
because she met a man called Paul

1117
01:25:48,232 --> 01:25:50,067
and that's who she's living with now.

1118
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:52,986
She comes to see you sometimes.

1119
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:54,821
- Anne?
- Yes.

1120
01:25:54,905 --> 01:25:56,907
Occasionally, she comes for the weekend.

1121
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:59,910
She comes here,
and you go for a walk in the park.

1122
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:04,039
And she tells you about her new life,
what she's up to.

1123
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:08,919
The other day she brought you coffee
'cause you like coffee.

1124
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:10,504
I detest coffee.

1125
01:26:11,255 --> 01:26:12,756
I only drink tea.

1126
01:26:15,634 --> 01:26:18,470
- Everything all right?
- Fine. We were just getting dressed.

1127
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,098
Everything all right?

1128
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:23,934
Yes.

1129
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:29,690
- There you go.
- Thank you. Have a nice day.

1130
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:31,483
See you later.

1131
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:38,282
Him, that one, who is he?

1132
01:26:38,782 --> 01:26:39,616
Who?

1133
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:43,787
Him, who just left.

1134
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:45,581
That's Bill.

1135
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:46,999
Bill?

1136
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:49,293
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

1137
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,253
Yes. Why?

1138
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:52,838
Oh, no reason. I just...

1139
01:26:53,839 --> 01:26:56,008
I just, I... How shall I put this?

1140
01:27:00,387 --> 01:27:01,763
What's he doing here?

1141
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:06,310
Here in my flat? Do I know him?

1142
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:10,272
He's Bill. You see him every day.

1143
01:27:11,815 --> 01:27:12,649
Do I?

1144
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:15,736
- And you...
- What?

1145
01:27:17,196 --> 01:27:18,572
Sorry to ask this, but...

1146
01:27:19,573 --> 01:27:21,033
I mean, you, who...?

1147
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:24,453
Who are you exactly?

1148
01:27:24,536 --> 01:27:25,662
I'm Catherine.

1149
01:27:26,538 --> 01:27:27,831
Catherine. That's right.

1150
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:30,542
Yes, yes, yes.

1151
01:27:31,084 --> 01:27:32,085
Catherine.

1152
01:27:33,045 --> 01:27:34,671
- And he's Bill.
- Yes.

1153
01:27:41,386 --> 01:27:42,513
What about me?

1154
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:47,684
Who...

1155
01:27:49,728 --> 01:27:51,396
exactly am I?

1156
01:27:52,856 --> 01:27:53,732
You?

1157
01:27:54,858 --> 01:27:55,817
You're Anthony.

1158
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,402
Anthony?

1159
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:58,904
Yes.

1160
01:28:00,572 --> 01:28:02,115
Anthony. It's a nice name.

1161
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:04,826
"Anthony," don't you think?

1162
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:08,413
It's a very nice name.

1163
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:11,959
My mother gave it to me, I imagine.

1164
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:14,711
- Do you know her?
- Who?

1165
01:28:15,838 --> 01:28:16,713
My mother.

1166
01:28:17,548 --> 01:28:18,841
- She...
- No.

1167
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:21,468
She had... She...

1168
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:25,931
She had such big eyes.

1169
01:28:28,141 --> 01:28:29,810
I can see her face now.

1170
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,438
She was... I hope she'll...

1171
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:36,900
come and see me sometime.

1172
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:39,069
Do you think? Mommy.

1173
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:44,366
You were saying she might come
occasionally at the weekend.

1174
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:45,450
Your daughter.

1175
01:28:48,203 --> 01:28:49,079
No.

1176
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:53,709
My mommy.

1177
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:03,635
I want my mommy.

1178
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:06,263
I want my mommy. I wanna get out of here.

1179
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:13,729
Have... Have someone come and fetch me.

1180
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:15,022
Now...

1181
01:29:15,105 --> 01:29:18,233
No, no. I want my mommy.
I want her to come and fetch me.

1182
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:20,444
I... I want to go home.

1183
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:22,404
What is it, Anthony?

1184
01:29:26,742 --> 01:29:27,743
What is it?

1185
01:29:31,205 --> 01:29:32,372
I feel as if I'm...

1186
01:29:32,998 --> 01:29:35,250
I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves.

1187
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:36,835
- Your leaves?
- Yeah.

1188
01:29:36,919 --> 01:29:38,253
What do you mean?

1189
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:42,049
The branches and the wind and the rain.

1190
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:48,680
I don't know what's happening anymore.

1191
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:51,517
Do you know what's happening?

1192
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:54,978
All this business about the flat.

1193
01:29:55,729 --> 01:30:01,193
I... I have nowhere
to put my head down anymore.

1194
01:30:05,614 --> 01:30:09,785
But I know my watch is on my wrist,
that I do know.

1195
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:12,162
For the journey.

1196
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:14,915
If not, I...

1197
01:30:18,043 --> 01:30:19,294
Don't know if I'll...

1198
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:22,381
be ready to...

1199
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:24,508
To...

1200
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:34,101
First...

1201
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:37,729
we'll get dressed, shall we?

1202
01:30:37,813 --> 01:30:38,730
Yes.

1203
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:40,607
We'll get dressed,

1204
01:30:41,233 --> 01:30:43,861
and then we'll go for a walk
in the park, shall we?

1205
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:44,820
Yes.

1206
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:46,363
Good.

1207
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:50,951
The trees and all the leaves.

1208
01:30:51,535 --> 01:30:54,663
Then we'll come back here,
and we'll have something to eat.

1209
01:30:54,746 --> 01:30:55,581
Yes.

1210
01:30:56,164 --> 01:30:58,792
And then you can have
your siesta, all right?

1211
01:30:58,876 --> 01:30:59,793
Yes.

1212
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:04,590
And then if you're feeling on good form,

1213
01:31:04,673 --> 01:31:07,176
we can go
for another little walk in the park.

1214
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:09,428
- Just the two of us.
- Yeah.

1215
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:11,346
Because it's such a lovely day.

1216
01:31:14,641 --> 01:31:16,143
It's sunny outside.

1217
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:22,024
And we have to go while it's sunny.

1218
01:31:22,107 --> 01:31:24,610
- We have to take that chance.
- Yeah.

1219
01:31:24,693 --> 01:31:27,571
'Cause it never lasts long
when the weather's this good, does it?

1220
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:28,655
No.

1221
01:31:29,406 --> 01:31:32,326
So... let's get dressed.

1222
01:31:32,409 --> 01:31:33,493
Is that all right?

1223
01:31:33,577 --> 01:31:34,912
No.

1224
01:31:34,995 --> 01:31:36,622
- Come on now.
- No.

1225
01:31:36,705 --> 01:31:38,081
Come on, baby.

1226
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:41,084
It's all right. Come on.

1227
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:43,045
