- Fuck her.
- Yeah. Fuck her.

26
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:37,507

- This is how business is done, man.

27
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,842
I mean, this is... well, it's
just a round of fucking golf.

28
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:41,244
You'd think we were
taking clients out

29
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:42,378
- to a strip club.
- Well... well...

30
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,846
Which we can't even do anymore.

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,182
PAUL: Exactly.
We can't even do that anymore

32
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:47,350
- since the Christmas party last year.
- Okay.

33
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:48,818
I think it's because
the golf club

34
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:49,886
doesn't let women play there.

35
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,721
- So?
- (snickers)

36
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:53,590
So it means we're having
client meetings without her.

37
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:57,627
Look, she should just focus
on closing her own shit

38
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,730
instead of whining about how
we're doing better than her.

some dignity, sweetheart?

43
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,206
You know, they put themselves
in danger, girls like that.

44
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,609
If she's not careful,
someone's gonna take advantage.

45
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,410
Especially the kind of guys
in this club.

(groans quietly)

47
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,348

58
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:37,433

60
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,941

Oh, my God,
you are so, so pretty.

353
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,695
But why are you wearing
all that makeup?

354
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,264
Do you mind me asking?

355
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:01,633
I never understood why women
wear so much makeup.

356
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,269
It's like, you guys are so much
more beautiful without it.

357
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,037
It's like, guys don't even like
that kind of stuff, you know?

358
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,039
It's just this
soul-sucking system

359
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,543
meant to oppress women,
and it's fucked up.

360
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:16,046
(Neil snorting)

361
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,382
(sniffing, exhales)

362
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:18,383
I want to see you.

363
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,051
- (sniffs) The real you.
- (thunder rumbling)

364
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:25,222
With all your freckles
and your imperfections.

365
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:29,627
(gags)

366
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:32,597
I don't feel good.

367
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,666
Could you get me
a glass of water?

368
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:37,100
Yeah. Sure.

369
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:43,373

(sighs):
Are you fucking kidding me?

373
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:54,619
Hey.

374
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:56,386
Hey, you.

375
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,023
Hey!

376
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,492
(chuckles):
Hey.

377
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:02,727
There you are.

378
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,261
You fell asleep.

379
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:13,337
(softly):
Good girl.

380
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,607
Feel better?

381
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,109
No.

382
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:20,644
You know, I, um...

383
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,113
I nearly didn't
come out tonight.

384
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:24,782
And I am so glad that I did.

385
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:27,084
I feel such a connection
to you.

386
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,119
Could you call me a cab?

387
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:31,321
You just got here.

388
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,524
- No, I need to go home.
- No.

389
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:35,459
Don't go.

390
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:37,261
Stay.

391
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:39,396
My God, you are so...

392
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,064
I need to go.

393
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,100
No, you don't want to go home.

00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,369

- Yeah?

♪ ♪

400
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:06,156
I said I need to go home.

401
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:08,158
Holy shit. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

402
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,326
What is this?

403
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,861
Are you some kind
of psycho or something?

404
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:12,329
Why do you say that?

405
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,164
- I just thought that you were...
- Drunk?

406
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:15,599
- Yeah.
- Really drunk?

407
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:16,700
Fuck.

408
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:17,801
Yeah.

409
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,236
Well, I'm not.

410
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,138
But that's good, isn't it?

411
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:23,340
- I think you should leave.
- Oh.

412
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:25,576
- Now you want me to leave?
- No.

413
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,312
I just... I'm really high.

414
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,314
Like, I'm really fucking high
right now.

415
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:31,848
I don't know what I'm doing.

416
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,284
(inhales sharply)
I think you should go.

417
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:37,254
But a second ago, you were
determined for me to stay.

418
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,289
You were pretty insistent,
actually.

419
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,491
I'm a nice guy.

420
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,393
Are you?

421
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,829
I thought we had
a connection, I guess.

422
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,331
A connection?

423
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,165
Okay.

424
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,101
What do I do for a living?

425
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,771
Sorry.
Maybe that one's too hard.

426
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,540
How old am I?

427
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:00,510
How long have I lived
in the city?

428
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:04,213
What are my hobbies?

429
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,685
What's my name?

430
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:12,389
All right.

431
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:15,291
All right, fuck,
I get your fucking point.

432
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:16,827
What do you want from me?

433
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,695
To say that I'm an asshole?

434
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:20,631
Fine, I'm a fucking asshole.

435
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:22,866
- Whoa.
- (thunder crashes)

436
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,901
Why are you so freaked out,
Neil?

437
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:26,369
You really need to calm down.

438
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:28,572
At least you didn't try
to have sex with me

439
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,806
while I was passed out.

440
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,340
You do get points for that.

441
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:33,810
A few guys, meh...
eh, they don't mind so much.

442
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:38,514
But you woke me up before
putting your fingers inside me.

443
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:40,651
- That was sweet.
- What are you trying to say?

444
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:43,252
That I'm, like,
a predator or something?

445
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,521
I don't know. Are you?

446
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,556
I am a nice guy.

447
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,191
You keep saying that.

448
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:50,861
You're not as rare as you think.

449
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:52,763
You know how I know?

450
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,330
No.

451
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:57,734
Because every week,
I go to a club,

452
00:19:57,768 --> 00:20:02,873
and every week, I act like
I'm too drunk to stand.

453
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:05,976
- And every...
- (grunts, shudders)

454
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,279
...fucking week,
a nice guy like you

455
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:13,416
comes over to see if I'm okay.

456
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,555
You want to fuck me still?

457
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,724
(whispers):
No, thank you, ma'am.

458
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:23,827
CASSANDRA:
Hmm.

459
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,728
No one ever does.

460
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:29,699
Careful next time
you go out, Neil.

461
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:32,601
Your novel sounds terrible,
by the way.

464
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:50,786
Night, Nina.

- (birds chirping outside)
- (clock ticking)

466
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:02,531
What's this?

467
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:08,270
Mom, what's this?

468
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,706
What do you mean?

469
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,576
This gift.

470
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:17,546
It's your birthday, Cassie.

471
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:21,784
Oh.

472
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,354
Yeah.

473
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:28,424
What kind of...

474
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,459
kind of person
forgets their 30th birthday?

475
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:33,028
Oh, sweetheart, come on.
Don't...

476
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:35,598
Don't, Stanley.
You know, please, don't.

477
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:37,500
CASSANDRA:
It was just a mistake, Mom.

478
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:39,068
You know I'm terrible
with dates.

479
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,836
It's not a big deal.

480
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,471
SUSAN:
Not a big deal?

481
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:44,573
Not a big deal?

482
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:48,377
You-you just forgot
your birthday.

483
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,346
You don't want to have a party?

484
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,348
You don't want to see
your friends?

485
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:54,083
You know I don't have
any friends, Mom.

486
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:56,919
Don't joke about it. Don't.

487
00:21:56,952 --> 00:22:00,556
Do you know how strange this is?

488
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:04,660
You, you're still living
here at home.

489
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,796
Working in that
stupid coffee shop

490
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,598
since you and Nina
dropped out of med school.

491
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,101
You're out all night long
doing God only knows what.

492
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,803
- STANLEY: Okay.
- SUSAN: And you...

493
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,905
You don't have any boyfriend.
You don't have any friends.

494
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:18,941
Mom, you should have saved
all that for my birthday card.

495
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:21,710
Why don't we just let the kid
celebrate however she wants?

496
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:24,479
- Okay?
- SUSAN: All my friends, they ask about you.

497
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,616
I-I-I don't know
what to tell them.

498
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,985
I-I don't know
what happened here.

499
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,822
I don't... (sobs)

(crying)

501
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,760
Why don't you just open
your present there, Cass?

502
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,094
Okay?

503
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Go ahead.

504
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,932
SUSAN:
Yeah.

505
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:56,278
Oh, I hope you like it.

506
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:02,517
Thank you.

508
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:09,158
- CASSANDRA: Yeah.
- That's direct.

509
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:11,659
A real kick in the cunt.

510
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,029
- Is it a nice suitcase, at least?
- Oh, yeah.

511
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:15,331
It's definitely the fanciest

512
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:18,133
"get the fuck out of our house"
metaphor I've received so far.

513
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,068
So, why don't you?

514
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:21,003
- What?
- Get the fuck out of their house.

515
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:24,472
- Just, I don't know, go on Zillow or...

<i>Single White Female</i> some girl.

00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,877
Get a basement room at some
weird guy's house, anything.

- I can't afford it, Gail.

519
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,413
Not on what you pay me.

520
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,149
Not even a weird guy's basement.

521
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:36,185
So take this other job, then.

522
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:37,186
Take any job.

523
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,454
Are you firing me?

524
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,456
Maybe I should.

525
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,791
Look, you're making
the assumption

526
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:45,493
that I want any of it.

527
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,661

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,899
and a job my mom could
brag about, I'd have done it.

530
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:54,035
It would take me ten minutes.
I don't want it.

531
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,837
I don't want it.

532
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:58,473
But you must want something.

533
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,708
- (door opens)
- RYAN: Hey.

534
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:03,145
- (Ryan clears throat)
- Oh. You.

535
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,914
- Hi.
- One coffee, hold the spit.

536
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:06,915
(Ryan chuckling)

537
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:09,484
She spat in my coffee last time.

538
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,553
I'm back because, um,

539
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:16,090
I think you gave me a...
a fake number the other day.

540
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,059
Mm, that doesn't sound like me.

541
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,193
I know.

542
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:21,230
So I spent a few hours composing

543
00:24:21,263 --> 00:24:23,798
a, like, very witty,
very romantic text,

544
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:28,069
and then I sent that text to
an oil rig worker called Red.

545
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,204
- Was he into it?
- Surprisingly into it.

546
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:33,541
It was, like,
immediately inappropriate.

547
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:36,077
But it's not gonna work out
'cause of the oil rig,

548
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,081
so I thought I'd try you again.

549
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:42,216
I just heard a phone ring
in the back.

550
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,619
- No, you didn't.
- I most definitely heard

551
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,521
a phone ring in the back.
(chuckles)

552
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:49,958
She has to take a few
imaginary calls a day.

(Gail laughing)

554
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,697
Um, look, if you're not
into this, totally get it.

555
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,733
I'm not really looking to date
anyone at the moment.

556
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,735
Right. Yeah.

557
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:01,936
Me, neither.

558
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,840
Would you... be interested
in a friendship

559
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:10,111
and I'm secretly pining for you
the whole time?

Everyone's horrible.

562
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:15,583
Okay, I went on a date
last month with a woman

563
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:16,851
who wanted to euthanize
the homeless.

564
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,586
You went on a date with my mom?

566
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:22,256

at med school.

567

568

569

and I can't stop thinking about
you spitting in my coffee.

570
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:31,032
So go to lunch with me
this weekend.

571
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,901
Please. If you don't like it,
we can have a safe word

572
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:37,005

no questions asked.

It was her, uh...
it was her grandfather's.

00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,848
No. It was... She got it
from the staff room,

595

but the worst part is
she looked me in the eye,

596

and then waved it at me.

Well, kids have passed

He got this hideous tattoo
of her name to propose.

00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,319
Amazingly, she said yes.

Yeah, I thought
he moved to London.

769
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,364
Yeah, he was there for years,

770
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,535
but he just moved back
to get married.

771
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,269
You see him a lot?

but he's in the group.

We actually
see each other at work,

774

anesthesiologist.

a feminist in college,

819
00:37:12,328 --> 00:37:13,630

to have a girlfriend

- who cares about something.
- (chuckles)

821

And, statistically,

822
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:18,435
feminists are more likely
to do anal.

823
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:19,970
That's a literal fact,
by the way.

824

00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:37,040
- Sorry.
- For your sake,

883
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:39,441
I was hoping you'd feel
different by now.

884
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:44,413
(sighs)

885
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:46,115
(slurring):
Look... look, don't be mad.

886
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:47,984
Just, I'll get the check,
all right?

887
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:49,953
It's my treat.

888
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,687
Hello?

889
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,989
(Madison sighs)

890
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:54,858
Are you okay, Madison?

891
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:58,161
My head is spinning.
I just feel...

892
00:39:58,194 --> 00:40:00,129
(gasps) Oh! Shit.

893
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:01,865
My God.

894
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,632
Sorry.

895
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:09,438
It really is so great
seeing you again.

896
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:12,441
You really haven't
changed at all.

897
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:14,978
That's great.

898
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:20,916
So?

899
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,686
She's over there.

900
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,023
Room 25.

901
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:29,758
Your money's in the envelope.

902
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,894
You sure about this?

903
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,896
I'm sure.

904
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,798
(door opens)

905
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:40,035
(door closes)

906
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:42,638
(cell phone vibrating)

907
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:46,675
(continues vibrating)

908
00:40:53,048 --> 00:40:54,449
(line beeps)

909
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:55,918
MADISON (recorded):
Cassie, hi.

910
00:40:55,951 --> 00:40:58,787
Um, wonderful to see you
for lunch yesterday.

911
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,789
Blast from the past.

912
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,157
Uh, hey.

913
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,059
I was pretty drunk.

914
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:05,961
I can't really, um...

915
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:09,932
Look, did you see me talking
to a guy, like, our age?

916
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:11,633
He seemed to know you.

917
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,102
Just trying to piece
some things together.

918
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:15,637
(line beeps)

919
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:17,940
Cassie, sorry.
Please call me back.

920
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:19,608
I-I'm freaking out a little.

921
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:21,810
I woke up in
one of the hotel rooms.

922
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:23,545
I-I think something
might have happened.

923
00:41:23,578 --> 00:41:25,480
I-I don't know.

924
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:34,690
♪ Uh-oh, I did it again ♪

925
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:38,827

and I can't pretend ♪

00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,197

927
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,200

00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:47,936

929
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:50,539
Your place, right?

930
00:41:50,572 --> 00:41:52,908
(music continues faintly
over stereo)

931
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,778
- See you tomorrow, bitches.
- Bye, Amber.

932
00:41:56,812 --> 00:41:58,714
- CASSANDRA: Excuse me.
- Bye.

933
00:41:58,747 --> 00:42:01,116
CASSANDRA:
Excuse me! Hi.

934
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:02,584
- Me?
- Yeah.

935
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:04,052
(chuckles):
Hi. Sorry.

936
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,187
What's up?

937
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,989
I'm so sorry,
but my-my phone has died,

938
00:42:07,022 --> 00:42:08,256
and I'm so late for work.

939
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,292
Do you live around here?
Do you know the area?

940
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:11,860
I guess. Why?

941
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,262
Would you tell me how to get
to the Castle Diner?

942
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:16,597
You know what?
I'm actually, like, really late.

943
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,266
Please. I'm supposed to be
shooting this music video,

944
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,667
- and I...
- Music video?

945
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:21,136
Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm
a makeup artist, and it's

946
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:23,772
my first time working with
these guys, and if I'm late,

947
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:25,874
- I may as well not...
- AMBER: Oh, my God.

948
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:26,875
Oh, my God.

949
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:28,243
Are you working for Wet Dreams?

950
00:42:28,276 --> 00:42:29,677
You didn't see that.

951
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,678
I know where
the Castle Diner is.

952
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:31,579
Don't worry about it.

953
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:32,513
- I'll ask someone else.
- No way. No way.

954
00:42:32,546 --> 00:42:35,150
Oh, my God, you're working
with Wet Dreams!

955
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:37,252
Oh, my God!
Are they there right now?

956
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:39,287
You need to calm down, please.

957
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:40,755
I can direct you. Please.

958
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,656
Sorry. No.

959
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,028
If I don't direct you,
how are you gonna find it?

960
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:47,295
I can't.

961
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:49,764
If you tell anyone
or you post about this,

962
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:51,665
I will never work again.

963
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,201
I swear I won't post anything.

964
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:54,336
I promise.

965
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:56,704
Take my phone.
Seriously, take it.

966
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,174
Ugh! God, okay.

967
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:00,275
Get in. Fine.

968
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:02,244
But you have to be
cool about this.

969
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:04,179
No. Of course I will.

970
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:06,881
(Amber squeals excitedly)

971
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:08,050
Whoa.

972
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,717
You really are a fan.

973
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,819
I'm obsessed.
I have a whole Insta

974
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:13,155
dedicated just to George's dog.

975
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:15,323
What a crazy coincidence.

976
00:43:15,357 --> 00:43:16,657
I know.

977
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,592
You know what?

978
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:20,594
This... this is fate.

979
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:24,099
Sure seems like it, huh?

980
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:25,866
(engine starts)

981
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,034
(lock clicks)

982
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:28,170
♪ Uh-oh. ♪

983
00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:30,571
♪ ♪

984
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,610
(phone rings)

985
00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:38,646
SECRETARY:
Yes?

986
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:44,051
Dean Walker is ready,
if you'd like to go on through.

987
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:55,830
- (door closes)
- Daisy.

988
00:43:55,863 --> 00:43:57,865
- That's me.
- Dean Walker.

989
00:43:57,898 --> 00:43:59,133
Please sit.

990
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:03,305
My assistant says that
you are interested

991
00:44:03,338 --> 00:44:05,272
in resuming med school.

992
00:44:05,306 --> 00:44:06,674
That's right.

993
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:08,410
May I ask what prompted
your desire

994
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:10,177
to get back to your studies?

995
00:44:10,211 --> 00:44:12,380
I guess...

996
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,949
I couldn't stop thinking
about my time here.

997
00:44:14,982 --> 00:44:17,118
Yeah.
It's an extraordinary place.

998
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:19,987
It's an unusual request.

999
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,390
Yes, but I left under
unusual circumstances.

1000
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:24,825
Oh.

1001
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:27,261
I left because of
what happened to Nina.

1002
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:28,362
Hmm.

1003
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:30,331
Nina Fisher.

1004
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:31,966
You don't remember her?

1005
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:36,203
Maybe you remember
Alexander Monroe?

1006
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:37,938
Oh, yes. Alexander Monroe.

1007
00:44:37,972 --> 00:44:41,008
He actually just came back
and gave a talk here.

1008
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,744
Oh, he's a...
he's a really nice guy.

1009
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:44,879
Really smart.

1010
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:46,714
- Are you a friend of his?
- No.

1011
00:44:46,747 --> 00:44:47,948
So, you don't remember

1012
00:44:47,982 --> 00:44:49,950
the accusations made
against Al Monroe?

1013
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:51,452
I don't.

1014
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:54,822
He took a girl, Nina Fisher,

1015
00:44:54,855 --> 00:44:58,826
the one you don't remember,
back to his room,

1016
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,162
where he had sex with her
repeatedly

1017
00:45:01,195 --> 00:45:02,429
and in front of his friends

1018
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:06,033
while she was too drunk to have
any idea what was going on.

1019
00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:08,402
She was covered in bruises
the next day.

1020
00:45:08,435 --> 00:45:11,405
Handprints,
I guess you could say.

1021
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,374
Was it reported?

1022
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:14,808
Yes.

1023
00:45:14,842 --> 00:45:16,844
Do you know who Nina spoke to?

1024
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:19,079
You.

1025
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:23,450
But you can't remember, so...

1026
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:25,718
You felt there wasn't
sufficient evidence.

1027
00:45:25,752 --> 00:45:27,021
You said it was too much

1028
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:30,124
of a "he said, she said"
situation.

1029
00:45:30,157 --> 00:45:31,258
Well...

1030
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:35,795
you know, we get accusations
like this all the time.

1031
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:37,198
One or two a week.

1032
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:39,866
I'm sorry I don't remember
your friend Nina,

1033
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,468
but I can assure you,
at that time,

1034
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:43,204
that I looked into it
thoroughly.

1035
00:45:43,237 --> 00:45:47,308
His friends were all
watching, laughing.

1036
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:48,808
It's so hard.

1037
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:50,777
But, you know, also,
if she was drinking

1038
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,846
and-and maybe couldn't
remember everything...

1039
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,949
So, she shouldn't
have been drunk?

1040
00:45:55,983 --> 00:45:58,385
- I'm not saying that. I...
- I'm sorry, I don't...

1041
00:45:58,419 --> 00:46:00,454
(chuckles): I don't mean
to sound critical, Dean Walker.

1042
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:02,855
I just want to be clear.

1043
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:05,092
None of us want to admit

1044
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,993
when we've made ourselves
vulnerable.

1045
00:46:07,026 --> 00:46:08,962
When we've made a bad choice.

1046
00:46:08,995 --> 00:46:11,098
And those choices,
those mistakes,

1047
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:15,102
can be so damaging
and really regrettable.

1048
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:19,506
- Regrettable?
- Yes.

1049
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,508
I mean, because
what would you have me do?

1050
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:23,410
Ruin a young man's life

1051
00:46:23,444 --> 00:46:26,079
every time we get
an accusation like this?

1052
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:28,948
So you're happy to take
the boy's word for it?

1053
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:31,117
I have to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

1054
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,951
Of course you do.

1055
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:34,787
Because innocent
until proven guilty.

1056
00:46:34,821 --> 00:46:37,291
No arguing with that.

1057
00:46:37,324 --> 00:46:39,393
No.

1058
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:41,295
Thank you for your time.

1059
00:46:42,296 --> 00:46:44,331

1448
01:08:33,866 --> 01:08:35,501
Thank you.

1449
01:08:35,534 --> 01:08:36,869
Sorry.

1450
01:08:36,902 --> 01:08:38,571
They're okay.

1451
01:08:38,604 --> 01:08:40,506
(crickets chirping)

1452
01:08:41,407 --> 01:08:43,242
- (gentle music playing)
- Cheese?

1453
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:44,376
RYAN:
Would love it.

1454
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,445
Yeah. Thank you.

1455
01:08:48,714 --> 01:08:50,583
- Bread?
- Ah, yep.

1456
01:08:50,616 --> 01:08:52,451
Okay.

1457
01:08:53,686 --> 01:08:56,154
Mm. Oh. Thank you.

1458
01:08:56,187 --> 01:08:57,856
What a home.
It's unbelievable.

1459
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:59,725
- So beautiful.
- Yeah, it's nice.

1460
01:08:59,758 --> 01:09:00,893
Susan works really hard.

1461
01:09:00,926 --> 01:09:03,127
- Yeah, it shows.
- Yeah.

1462
01:09:03,161 --> 01:09:05,598
Eat, eat, before it gets cold.

1463
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:06,732
This looks delicious.

1464
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:08,867
- Oh. (gasps) Oh.
- Thank you.

1465
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:10,603
I made the sauce.

1466
01:09:10,636 --> 01:09:12,638
RYAN:
The sauce is...

1467
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,341
Mm.

1468
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,510
The sauce is really good.

1469
01:09:19,645 --> 01:09:21,447
- Incredible.
- SUSAN: Mm.

1470
01:09:22,648 --> 01:09:25,484
Ryan, I hear you're a doctor.

1471
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:27,720
Your parents must be
very, very proud.

1472
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,724
Not really.
Uh, they wanted me to be a DJ.

1473
01:09:33,892 --> 01:09:35,628
(chuckles awkwardly)

1474
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:39,865
(laughing)

1475
01:09:39,898 --> 01:09:41,432
He's funny.

1476
01:09:41,466 --> 01:09:43,301
- (Stanley continues laughing)
- Yeah.

1477
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:44,536
STANLEY:
That's funny.

1478
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,905
You didn't say
he was funny, Cassie.

1479
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:49,507
- Dad.
- You didn't say I was...

1480
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:52,176
- You didn't say I was funny?
- No.

1481
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:54,178
I said you were boring but rich.

1482
01:09:54,212 --> 01:09:56,314
I am boring. Not that rich.

1483
01:09:56,347 --> 01:09:57,716
- (laughter)
- No? Well, in that case,

1484
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:58,917
thanks for stopping by, kid.

1485
01:09:58,951 --> 01:10:00,284
(laughter)

1486
01:10:00,318 --> 01:10:02,520
What kind of doctoring
do you do?

1487
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:04,857
Uh, pediatric, so...

1488
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,658
children.

1489
01:10:06,692 --> 01:10:08,226
What was your, uh...

1490
01:10:08,259 --> 01:10:10,729
What was that doctor's name?
Cassie's doctor.

1491
01:10:10,763 --> 01:10:13,197
- Gary?
- Um, no.

1492
01:10:13,231 --> 01:10:15,333
Dr. Katzen-something.

1493
01:10:15,366 --> 01:10:17,568
CASSANDRA:
Yeah. Dad, he was like 80.

1494
01:10:17,602 --> 01:10:18,904
Yeah, well...

1495
01:10:18,937 --> 01:10:20,773
You-you don't know
Dr. Katzen...?

1496
01:10:20,806 --> 01:10:21,907
No.

1497
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,408
SUSAN:
Now, I'm-I'm confused.

1498
01:10:23,441 --> 01:10:27,545
Are there different parts
of the body on a child?

1499
01:10:27,578 --> 01:10:29,848
No, it's pretty much
the same thing.

1500
01:10:29,882 --> 01:10:30,983
You're just...

1501
01:10:31,016 --> 01:10:33,251
You know, different-colored
Band-Aids and things.

1502
01:10:33,284 --> 01:10:36,254
It's not brain surgery.
(chuckles softly)

1503
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,655
- Well...
- (laughs)

1504
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:40,358
I get it. Yeah.

1505
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:41,826
- Oh.
- (chuckles)

1506
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:44,295
This sauce is
absolutely unbelievable.

1507
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:46,297
(laughing quietly)

1508
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,699
SUSAN:
Night, you two.

1509
01:10:47,732 --> 01:10:49,400
CASSANDRA:
Night.

1510
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:56,641
Thanks for
introducing us to Ryan.

1511
01:10:59,044 --> 01:11:00,812
I know it was hard.

1512
01:11:02,047 --> 01:11:04,482
You know, your mom, she's...

1513
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:10,354
(chuckles): Well, I mean,
we're both so glad that, uh...

1514
01:11:11,022 --> 01:11:12,490
Oh, my God, Dad.

1515
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:13,991
(chuckles):
He's not that nice.

1516
01:11:14,025 --> 01:11:16,260
(laughs):
Yeah.

1517
01:11:16,294 --> 01:11:19,297
Yeah, I must be tired.

1518
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:21,499
(sighs):
Okay.

1519
01:11:24,035 --> 01:11:28,740
Honey, Nina was like
a daughter to us.

1520
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:30,341
You know that.

1521
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:32,577
We really miss her.

1522
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:36,848
(sighs)
But, God, we have missed you.

1523
01:11:41,052 --> 01:11:43,020
See you tomorrow.

1524
01:11:43,054 --> 01:11:45,757
(sighs, chuckles)

1525
01:11:53,064 --> 01:11:55,800
RYAN: <i>Your mom...
oh, your mom is hot.</i>

1526
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,034
- Sorry.
- (laughing)

1527
01:11:57,068 --> 01:12:00,071
(chuckles):
Your mom is extremely hot.

1528
01:12:00,104 --> 01:12:02,339
Do you want her number?

1529
01:12:03,074 --> 01:12:04,976
- I could hook you up.
- Really?

1530
01:12:05,009 --> 01:12:06,376
Ooh.

1531
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:08,311
I think she likes you
more than I do.

1532
01:12:08,345 --> 01:12:10,548
Well, I hope that's not true.

1533
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:15,285
Can I... Mm.

1534
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:18,055
Can I tell you something?

1535
01:12:18,089 --> 01:12:19,857
Sure.

1536
01:12:22,392 --> 01:12:24,394
I think you're amazing. I...

1537
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:26,531
- Oh, no, Ryan.
- Just shut up, you stupid bitch.

1538
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:27,932
- Please don't.
- Shh. I...

1539
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:29,867
- Just take this, please.
- Mm-hmm.

1540
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:32,036
I think you're incredible. I...

1541
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:34,639
I'm... (sighs)

1542
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:38,408
I'm-I'm... I think
I'm falling in love with you.

1543
01:12:42,713 --> 01:12:45,716
I think I'm falling
in love with you, too.

1544
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:46,416
(softly):
Yes.

1545
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:47,919
- Oh, my God.
- Don't make...

1546
01:12:47,952 --> 01:12:49,519
- Oh, my.
- Don't make a thing of it.

1547
01:12:49,553 --> 01:12:51,421
- I'm gonna buy you a bicycle.
- No.

1548
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:53,691
- I want to buy you a bicycle.
- Ryan, be cool.

1549
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:55,392
I'm cool.

1550
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:58,129
- (whispers): I'm so cool.
- (laughing)

1551
01:12:58,162 --> 01:13:00,530
Oh, I'm the coolest.

1552
01:13:00,564 --> 01:13:02,900
(humming "Stars Are Blind")

1553
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:07,839
Cassie.

1554
01:13:07,872 --> 01:13:10,107
Shit.

1555
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:12,375
Madison,
what are you doing here?

1556
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:13,911
Sorry. I, um...

1557
01:13:13,945 --> 01:13:15,512
I tried calling.

1558
01:13:15,545 --> 01:13:18,049
I left messages
about, uh, that guy.

1559
01:13:18,082 --> 01:13:19,716
Your friend.

1560
01:13:19,749 --> 01:13:22,619
Um, I don't know if-if your
phone number wasn't working.

1561
01:13:22,652 --> 01:13:24,654
Maybe I had an old one.
I just... I mean...

1562
01:13:24,688 --> 01:13:27,524
I know it seems kind of crazy,
me waiting on your porch

1563
01:13:27,557 --> 01:13:29,559
like some kind of stalker
or something.

1564
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:31,494
Madison, I'm sorry.
I should've called you back.

1565
01:13:31,528 --> 01:13:34,865
Nothing happened with that guy.
Please believe me.

1566
01:13:34,898 --> 01:13:37,634
Are you sure? I...
But it seemed like...

1567
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,171
I know what it seemed like,
but it wasn't.

1568
01:13:40,204 --> 01:13:41,838
He didn't touch you.

1569
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,475
(sighs):
Oh, thank God.

1570
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:47,944
(sobs):
Oh.

1571
01:13:47,978 --> 01:13:49,579
(sniffles)

1572
01:13:49,613 --> 01:13:52,515
Oh, I was...
I was so worried that, um...

1573
01:13:52,549 --> 01:13:54,118
that I... that he and I, um...

1574
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:55,919
He just put you in bed.

1575
01:13:55,952 --> 01:13:58,688
Kept an eye on you
to make sure you were okay.

1576
01:13:58,722 --> 01:14:01,024
I'm really sorry
I didn't call you back.

1577
01:14:01,057 --> 01:14:02,993
It wasn't nice.

1578
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:04,494
Yeah, well...

1579
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,763
God. Look, there...

1580
01:14:06,796 --> 01:14:08,132
(sighs)

1581
01:14:08,165 --> 01:14:09,933
I need to show you something.

1582
01:14:09,966 --> 01:14:12,102
Okay.

1583
01:14:12,136 --> 01:14:14,404
Can we go inside?

1584
01:14:16,006 --> 01:14:17,974
Yeah.

1585
01:14:24,814 --> 01:14:27,717
Do you want a glass of water
or something?

1586
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:29,619
No, thank you.

1587
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:44,234
Oh.

1588
01:14:44,267 --> 01:14:48,571
After we had lunch and...

1589
01:14:48,605 --> 01:14:52,609
I got so drunk and woke up
in a hotel room with that guy,

1590
01:14:52,642 --> 01:14:55,979
um, I thought about it.

1591
01:14:56,012 --> 01:14:58,214
About what you said about Nina.

1592
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:01,551
And how we all
just acted like...

1593
01:15:06,723 --> 01:15:09,893
And I remembered something.

1594
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:11,594
What?

1595
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:16,533
What?

1596
01:15:18,068 --> 01:15:19,936
There was a tape.

1597
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:26,109
- What?
- A stupid video.

1598
01:15:26,142 --> 01:15:28,211
It just got sent around.

1599
01:15:28,244 --> 01:15:29,846
I got sent it.

1600
01:15:29,879 --> 01:15:31,815
Everyone did.
At the time, it was...

1601
01:15:32,682 --> 01:15:34,818
It was just gossip, you know?

1602
01:15:34,851 --> 01:15:36,618
Gossip?

1603
01:15:38,154 --> 01:15:42,759
So much stuff happened
back then, like, all the time.

1604
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:44,260
You know what it was like.

1605
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:46,196
It was just one blackout
after the next.

1606
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:49,099
I-I hoped I'd imagined it.

1607
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:50,934
But, um...

1608
01:15:53,937 --> 01:15:56,840
I always saved all my phones
for photos or whatever.

1609
01:15:56,873 --> 01:15:59,042
So, um...

1610
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,846
Here.

1611
01:16:02,879 --> 01:16:06,548
I don't know how we all could
have watched it and, um...

1612
01:16:08,918 --> 01:16:10,519
What?

1613
01:16:11,187 --> 01:16:13,589
Thought it was funny.

1614
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,229
You can have the phone, okay?

1615
01:16:19,262 --> 01:16:22,698
You don't have to watch it.
I really wouldn't watch it.

1616
01:16:22,731 --> 01:16:25,035
But, um, I don't know,
do whatever you want with it.

1617
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:27,803
Just leave me out of it.

1618
01:16:27,836 --> 01:16:29,671
And...

1619
01:16:29,705 --> 01:16:32,008
please, will you do me a favor?

1620
01:16:33,942 --> 01:16:35,111
Yeah.

Al Monroe's bachelor party is.

Think about this, please.
Please.

1715
01:21:00,441 --> 01:21:05,279
I cannot begin to tell you
how much I've thought about it.

1725

You got to forgive me.

1726
01:21:41,382 --> 01:21:44,452

1727
01:21:44,485 --> 01:21:46,320

1734
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:03,404
I don't know.

Yeah.

01:22:17,318 --> 01:22:20,254
Don't tell any of them
that I'm coming,

1742
01:22:20,287 --> 01:22:23,090
'cause I'll send the video
around just the same if you do.

Well, the doctor's here.

1757
01:24:27,814 --> 01:24:30,283
(others cheering,
whooping, laughing)

1758
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:41,227
- Stripper time, baby! Let's go!
- (cheering)

1759
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:44,130
- Let's go!
- Nurse, I'm feeling sick!

1760
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:45,665
(laughing):
Please take my temperature.

1761
01:24:45,698 --> 01:24:47,534
I told you guys no strippers.

1762
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:49,135
Anastasia's gonna lose her shit.

1763
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:50,336
(others groaning)

1764
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,272
All right, who ordered her?

1765
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:53,806
- Joe?
- Don't look at me.

1766
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,276
(chuckles)
No one's owning up?

1767
01:24:56,309 --> 01:24:58,111
All right, well, when Anastasia
finds out, it's your fucking

1768
01:24:58,144 --> 01:24:59,479
- funeral, you hear me?
- Get out of here.

1769
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:01,447
- (laughter)
- I take it you're the groom?

1770
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:03,149
Yeah.

1771
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:04,350
(men whooping)

1772
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,386
- Then sit the fuck down.
- (laughter, yelling)

1773
01:25:06,419 --> 01:25:07,820
Oh, shit!

1774
01:25:07,854 --> 01:25:09,689
Now.

1775
01:25:09,722 --> 01:25:12,825
I'm gonna need you all
to kneel down in front of me

1776
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:15,128
like the naughty boys you are.

1777
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:16,829
- MEN: Oh...
- JOE: Come on, come on.

Everybody here?

1780
01:25:20,733 --> 01:25:22,468
I don't want anyone to miss out.

1781
01:25:22,502 --> 01:25:25,438
Oh, yeah. All the patients
are accounted for, Nurse.

1782

No, it's okay.
I don't, uh, w-want to.

1799
01:26:18,891 --> 01:26:20,627
Look, I don't
have to do anything

1800
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,894
if you don't want me to,

1801
01:26:21,928 --> 01:26:25,263
but I only get paid
if I go upstairs with you.

1802
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,167
(sighs) Okay.

1803
01:26:29,201 --> 01:26:31,536
- Okay, you guys.
- (cheering)

1804
01:26:33,305 --> 01:26:35,908
JOE: I better see her crawling
out of here in the morning!

1805
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:37,877
She better not be able to walk!

1806
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:39,912
Leave some for us, man!

1807
01:26:39,946 --> 01:26:40,980
(door opens)

1808
01:26:41,014 --> 01:26:42,547
(men hollering,
dance music playing downstairs)

1809
01:26:42,581 --> 01:26:43,650
(door closes)

1810
01:26:43,683 --> 01:26:45,685
Uh, so what do I, uh...

1811
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:47,619
Get on the bed.

1812
01:26:47,653 --> 01:26:48,855
Okay.

1813
01:26:48,888 --> 01:26:50,322
I'm a little scared of you.

1814
01:26:50,355 --> 01:26:52,759
You don't need to be scared.
Get on the bed.

1815
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:55,928
(grunting):
All right.

1816
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:57,797
Oh! Uh, no, no, no. Sorry.

1817
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:58,865
I-I'm not sure about that.

1818
01:26:58,898 --> 01:27:01,600
It's for my safety.
When I give private dances,

1819
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:03,735
guys can get
a little handsy, so...

1820
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,637
Oh, right. Yeah, of course.

1821
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:08,507
(chuckling)

1822
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,543
You know, you don't...
you don't need to...

1823
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:12,812
I'm a gentleman.

1824
01:27:12,845 --> 01:27:14,613
- Are you? (laughs)
- Yeah.

1825
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,582
You might be surprised
to hear that gentlemen

1826
01:27:17,616 --> 01:27:18,951
are sometimes the worst.

1827
01:27:18,985 --> 01:27:20,552
Ow. Oh.

1828
01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:22,754
Sorry, can you, uh...
can you loosen these a little?

1829
01:27:22,788 --> 01:27:25,691
- You'll get used to it.
- Ooh.

1830
01:27:25,724 --> 01:27:27,526
(chuckles)

1831
01:27:27,559 --> 01:27:29,761
Look, I-I don't want to sound
like a pussy,

1832
01:27:29,795 --> 01:27:33,598
but y-you're not... you're not
gonna do anything, are you?

1833
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,835
It's just... I love my fiancée,

1834
01:27:36,868 --> 01:27:38,403
- and we're getting married.
- Aw.

1835
01:27:38,437 --> 01:27:40,405
- So I-I don't want any, uh...
- (chuckles)

1836
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:42,841
Hey, do I look like someone
who would make you

1837
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:44,976
do something
you don't want to do?

1838
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:47,679
- No.
- Exactly.

1839
01:27:47,713 --> 01:27:49,448
(chuckles, snorts)

1840
01:27:49,481 --> 01:27:51,616
Ay.

1841
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:53,618
So, what's your name?

1842
01:27:53,652 --> 01:27:54,653
Candy.

1843
01:27:55,887 --> 01:27:58,590
- I mean your real name.
- Nina.

1844
01:27:58,623 --> 01:28:00,225
Nina Fisher.

1845
01:28:01,993 --> 01:28:03,962
What did you say?

1846
01:28:03,995 --> 01:28:06,231
I said my name is Nina Fisher.

1847
01:28:07,065 --> 01:28:08,934
Can you let me go, please?

1848
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:10,302
I'm sorry, I can't.

1849
01:28:10,335 --> 01:28:11,803
Did one of the guys
put you up to this?

1850
01:28:11,837 --> 01:28:13,338
Was it Joe?

1851
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:15,807
Jesus Christ, that was dark,
even for him.

1852
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:16,975
I don't follow.

1853
01:28:17,008 --> 01:28:19,010
- You're not Nina Fisher.
- Why not?

1854
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:22,013
(sighs)
Because she's dead, okay?

1855
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,482
Must be another Nina Fisher.

1856
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:24,449
- A coincidence.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

1857
01:28:24,483 --> 01:28:26,351
Hey, can you let me
out of these, please?

1858
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:27,285
This isn't funny.

1859
01:28:27,319 --> 01:28:29,321
Why would I give you
a dead girl's name?

1860
01:28:29,354 --> 01:28:32,357
Hey, this is fucked up, okay?
Stop.

1861
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,826
But I'm not doing anything.

1862
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,293
Guys! Hey, Joe?

1863
01:28:36,328 --> 01:28:37,496
Br-Brandon, Chip.
Hey, guys.

1864
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:39,765
Can you get up here, please?

1865
01:28:41,466 --> 01:28:43,435
I don't think they can hear you.

1866
01:28:43,468 --> 01:28:46,905
And even if they could,
they're all passed out by now.

1867
01:28:46,938 --> 01:28:50,341
'Cause if there is one thing
I learned at Forrest,

1868
01:28:50,374 --> 01:28:54,411
it's how easy it is
to slip something into a drink.

1869
01:28:54,446 --> 01:28:56,882
You'd think they'd
remember that, especially Joe.

1870
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,316
♪ ♪

1871
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,652
Do I know you?

1872
01:29:00,685 --> 01:29:02,788
I'm not sure
you would remember me, Al.

1873
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:05,490
You were so popular.

1874
01:29:10,028 --> 01:29:12,063
You're Nina's friend.

1875
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:13,430
Fuck!

1876
01:29:13,464 --> 01:29:14,833
You're Nina's friend.

1877
01:29:14,866 --> 01:29:17,002
So you did notice me after all.

1878
01:29:17,035 --> 01:29:18,536
I'm surprised.

1879
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:20,504
I wasn't super fuckable
back then,

1880
01:29:20,538 --> 01:29:22,406
so I thought I kind of
slipped your attention.

1881
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:23,942
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... (sighs)
What do you want?

1882
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:25,610
Money?
You blackmailing me?

1883
01:29:25,644 --> 01:29:29,313
I want you to tell me
what you did.

1884
01:29:30,548 --> 01:29:33,417
Are y...
are you talking about...

1885
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,953
What do you think
I'm talking about?

1886
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:36,087
I didn't do anything!

1887
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,689
W-We were kids.

1888
01:29:37,722 --> 01:29:39,925
Oh, if I hear that
one more time.

1889
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,425
Look...
(stammers, sighs)

1890
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:42,861
Maybe she regretted it after,
okay?

1891
01:29:42,894 --> 01:29:45,596
- Oh, yeah, she regretted it.
- I didn't do anything!

1892
01:29:45,629 --> 01:29:46,832
- Wrong!
- What the fuck...

1893
01:29:46,865 --> 01:29:48,499
Look, I... (chuckles)

1894
01:29:48,532 --> 01:29:50,734
I don't know what
you want me to say, okay,

1895
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:52,670
b-b-but we-we did not...

1896
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:56,942
What?

1897
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:58,776
You know.

1898
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,445
No.

1899
01:30:01,478 --> 01:30:03,114
She could barely
hold her head up.

1900
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:04,950
She had no idea
what was going on.

1901
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,151
It was a fucking party.

1902
01:30:06,184 --> 01:30:08,053
I-I mean, yeah, look,
we were all drunk,

1903
01:30:08,086 --> 01:30:09,854
of course,
but-but-but she was into it.

1904
01:30:09,888 --> 01:30:13,357
Didn't look like she was
into it on the video.

1905
01:30:14,692 --> 01:30:15,961
What video?

1906
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:17,795
Oh, you don't remember?

1907
01:30:17,828 --> 01:30:19,663
Your friend Joe taped it.

1908
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:22,433
Let me tell you, that party
does not look so good

1909
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:24,468
in the cold light of day.

1910
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:29,007
Look, I'll-I'll give you
anything, okay?

1911
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,808
I mean, I'll-I'll do anything.

1912
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:32,010
Anything.

1913
01:30:32,043 --> 01:30:33,844
Aw. Don't cry.

1914
01:30:33,878 --> 01:30:35,613
Really, don't fucking cry.

1915
01:30:35,646 --> 01:30:37,581
Tell me what you did.

1916
01:30:37,615 --> 01:30:39,016
I didn't do anything wrong,
though!

1917
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:41,018
She dropped out.

1918
01:30:41,051 --> 01:30:43,888
Top of her class,
and she dropped out.

1919
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:45,756
I did, too, to take care of her.

1920
01:30:45,789 --> 01:30:47,691
- The two of us gone.
- (sobs softly)

1921
01:30:47,725 --> 01:30:49,927
You graduated
magna cum laude, though.

1922
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,629
Did you ever feel guilty,

1923
01:30:51,662 --> 01:30:53,497
or did you just feel relieved
that she'd gone?

1924
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,032
You know, I was affected
by it, too, okay?

1925
01:30:55,065 --> 01:30:56,467
I mean, it's every guy's
worst nightmare,

1926

worst nightmare is?

1928
01:31:03,941 --> 01:31:06,977
The thing is you thought
you'd gotten away with it

1929
01:31:07,011 --> 01:31:08,646
because everyone had forgotten.

1930
01:31:08,679 --> 01:31:11,148

- But I haven't.

1932

1933
01:31:17,254 --> 01:31:20,491
I wanted to be a doctor
my whole life.

1934
01:31:20,524 --> 01:31:23,193
But lately,
I've been feeling like...

1935
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:25,429
I might want to get
back into it.

- Please. Please stop. Hey.

1938
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,201
Nina was extraordinary.

1939
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:32,670
So smart.

I want you to know
what she was like, okay?

1946
01:31:43,047 --> 01:31:44,214
(crying):
Come on.

1947
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:45,683
She's just so difficult
to explain,

1948
01:31:45,716 --> 01:31:47,251
'cause she was just
so completely herself.

1949
01:31:47,284 --> 01:31:50,453
Even when she was
four years old.

1950
01:31:51,855 --> 01:31:55,259
She was fully formed
from day one.

1951
01:31:55,292 --> 01:31:59,129
Same face. Same walk.

1952
01:31:59,163 --> 01:32:01,098
And funny.

1953

1956

I couldn't believe
she wanted to be my friend.

1957
01:32:10,307 --> 01:32:13,277
She didn't give a fuck
what anyone else thought,

1958
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:17,147
apart from me,
'cause she was just...

1959
01:32:17,181 --> 01:32:19,582
Nina.

1960
01:32:22,052 --> 01:32:24,587
And then she wasn't.

1961
01:32:25,756 --> 01:32:28,292
Suddenly,
she was something else.

1962
01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:29,960
She was yours.

1963
01:32:29,994 --> 01:32:31,161
(whimpers, gasps)

1964
01:32:31,195 --> 01:32:34,564

when she was walking around.

1965
01:32:34,597 --> 01:32:36,566
- It was yours.

1967

All over her all the time.

1968
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:45,641
And it just...

1969
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:49,880
...squeezed her out.

1970
01:32:50,914 --> 01:32:52,648
(panting, sobbing)

1971
01:32:52,682 --> 01:32:55,319
So, when I heard
your name again...

1972
01:32:55,352 --> 01:32:59,622
your filthy fucking name...

1973
01:32:59,655 --> 01:33:04,328
I wondered, when was the last
time anyone had said hers?

1974
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:06,263
Or thought it, even?

1975
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:08,298

I've sterilized everything.

SUSAN:
<i>Can't you just</i>

2109
01:40:54,863 --> 01:40:58,332
do that thing where you track
her cell phone or something?

2110
01:40:58,365 --> 01:40:59,633
I'm sorry, ma'am.

2111
01:40:59,666 --> 01:41:02,336
It was turned off
before she left.

2112
01:41:02,369 --> 01:41:04,505
Seems like she really
didn't want anyone

2113
01:41:04,538 --> 01:41:06,273
to know where she was.

2114
01:41:06,306 --> 01:41:08,208
(sighs)
But it-it's...

2115
01:41:08,242 --> 01:41:10,244
it's just not like her
to disappear like this.

2116
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:12,412
Well, that's not
entirely true, honey.

2117
01:41:12,446 --> 01:41:14,248
Stanley.

2118
01:41:14,281 --> 01:41:17,818
I... You know, she's...

2119
01:41:17,851 --> 01:41:20,053
she was getting better.

2120
01:41:20,087 --> 01:41:21,588
She was, really.

2121
01:41:21,622 --> 01:41:23,657
- She was getting better.
- STANLEY: Yes, she was.

2122
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:25,626
She... Of course she was.

2123
01:41:25,659 --> 01:41:27,728
She'll come back.

2124
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:29,530
You know how she is.

2125
01:41:29,563 --> 01:41:31,164
She always comes back.

2126
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:32,799
Was she seeing anyone?

2127
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:35,135
Did she have a boyfriend?

Yeah.

2134
01:41:51,385 --> 01:41:52,753

Pediatric surgeon, huh?

2136
01:41:54,588 --> 01:41:55,789
Yeah. (chuckles)

2137
01:41:55,822 --> 01:41:57,391
That's very commendable.

2138
01:41:57,424 --> 01:42:00,460
Thank you for all that you do
for the community.

2139
01:42:00,494 --> 01:42:02,128
Sure. Yeah.

2140
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:05,097
I'm sorry to bother you
at work, Doctor.

2141
01:42:05,131 --> 01:42:07,634
Do you know a Cassandra Thomas?

2142
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:10,771
Yeah. Yes.

2143
01:42:10,804 --> 01:42:12,104
(clears throat) Yes.

2144
01:42:12,138 --> 01:42:14,274
- How do you know her?
- We were...

2145
01:42:15,742 --> 01:42:18,177
We were seeing each other.

2146
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:20,179
Were seeing each other?

2147
01:42:20,212 --> 01:42:22,716
We broke up a few days ago.

2148
01:42:22,749 --> 01:42:24,585
Define "a few days."

2149
01:42:25,619 --> 01:42:26,853
Last Thursday.

2150
01:42:26,887 --> 01:42:30,189
Have you had any contact since?

2151
01:42:30,222 --> 01:42:32,492
No. I'm sorry,
what is this regarding?

2152
01:42:32,526 --> 01:42:35,829
Cassandra's parents have filed
a missing persons report.

2153
01:42:35,862 --> 01:42:37,598
I'm sorry, what?

2154
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:38,832
Why?

2155
01:42:38,865 --> 01:42:41,568
Because she's missing.

2156
01:42:41,602 --> 01:42:44,136
Since when?

2157
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:45,505
Since Friday.

2158
01:42:45,539 --> 01:42:47,641
She told her parents
something about a work trip,

2159
01:42:47,674 --> 01:42:49,910
but her colleague didn't know
anything about it.

2160
01:42:49,943 --> 01:42:52,244
Do you have any idea
where she might have been

2161
01:42:52,278 --> 01:42:54,413
going to this weekend?

2162
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,653
She mentioned, uh,
the work trip.

2163
01:42:59,686 --> 01:43:02,221
- Yeah.
- Any idea where?

2164
01:43:04,256 --> 01:43:07,594
(sighs) N-No. No.

2165
01:43:07,628 --> 01:43:10,262
I'm sorry.

2166
01:43:10,296 --> 01:43:11,932
That's all right, Doc.

2167
01:43:11,965 --> 01:43:13,900
Between you and me, it, uh,

2168
01:43:13,934 --> 01:43:16,569
sounded like she wasn't
feeling so good.

2169
01:43:16,603 --> 01:43:18,204
Mentally, I mean.

2170
01:43:18,237 --> 01:43:21,540
Her father seemed to think
she was a little unstable.

2171
01:43:23,275 --> 01:43:25,846
Yeah, she was...

2172
01:43:25,879 --> 01:43:29,348
not in a good place.

2173
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:35,287
Do you think she might have
wanted to hurt herself?

2174
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:40,626
Yeah.

2175
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,262
Uh, she could've.

2176
01:43:43,295 --> 01:43:45,364
She could've, yeah.

2177
01:43:45,398 --> 01:43:48,267
I thought that might
be the case.

2178
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,469
Thank you for your honesty.

2179
01:43:50,503 --> 01:43:52,371
Well, I don't want
to bother you anymore,

2180
01:43:52,405 --> 01:43:54,440
but if you wouldn't mind coming
to the station tomorrow,

2181
01:43:54,473 --> 01:43:55,842
you know,
for an official statement.

2182
01:43:55,876 --> 01:43:57,844
Of course.
Anything I can do to help.

2183
01:43:57,878 --> 01:43:59,245
Thank you for your time,
Doctor.

2184
01:43:59,278 --> 01:44:01,313
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

2185
01:44:01,347 --> 01:44:02,848

2186
01:44:02,883 --> 01:44:05,418

2189
01:44:18,731 --> 01:44:22,501
Anastasia, you're the greatest
thing that ever happened to me.

2190
01:44:22,535 --> 01:44:25,604
You are my moral compass
and the love of my life.

2191
01:44:25,638 --> 01:44:28,307
ANASTASIA:
Al, you are my best friend

2192
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:30,476
and my soul mate.

2193
01:44:30,509 --> 01:44:31,944
I love you.

Al's like a brother to me.

2195
01:44:33,512 --> 01:44:34,914
We grew up together. We're...

2196
01:44:34,947 --> 01:44:36,248
We're the best of friends.

2197
01:44:36,282 --> 01:44:37,550
We've been through
thick and thin.

2198
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:40,586
- (quiet laughter)
- And-and I just love him.

2199
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:43,422
And, you know,
he's met Anastasia, who,

2200
01:44:43,456 --> 01:44:46,726
by all accounts, is,
you know, just a solid catch.

See that bridesmaid over there?

2207
01:45:03,442 --> 01:45:05,411
Whew. Just the type of girl
that makes you

2208
01:45:05,444 --> 01:45:07,713
go home to your wife
and say... (groans)

2209
01:45:07,747 --> 01:45:10,349
You know she trained
at Cirque du Soleil?

2210
01:45:10,382 --> 01:45:13,018
Come on her ass and her face
at the same time.

2211
01:45:13,052 --> 01:45:15,020
- That's nice.
- (sighs) Unbelievable.

2212
01:45:15,054 --> 01:45:16,388
- Everything just turned out so nice.
- Yeah.

2213
01:45:16,422 --> 01:45:17,423
JOE:
It's good seeing you.

2214
