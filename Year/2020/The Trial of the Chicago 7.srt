What we saw were population centers.

29

Schoolhouses, pagodas, women and children.

30
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,875
And that's American napalm.

31
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,291
Women and children were burned alive. Tom?

32
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,500
The Democratic Party

33
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:45,333
is gonna end up nominating Hubert Humphrey
next month in Chicago.

34
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,666
Now, when it comes to the war
and social justice,

35
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,416
there is simply not enough of a difference

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,916
between Humphrey and Nixon
to make a difference.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,833
And so, we're going to Chicago.

38
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,916
Young people, by busloads,
will go to Chicago

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,333
to show our solidarity and our disgust.

40
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,916
But most importantly…

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,791
- To get laid by someone you just met.
- [crowd laughs]

42
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:11,458

Anyone who stays in the park,
sings Woody Guthrie, they'll be fine.

[crowd laughs]

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,833
But the cops are gonna be a half-inch
from losin' their fuckin' minds,

50
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,166
'cause Daley's gonna wind 'em up
to make sure of it.

51
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,791
We're goin' to Chicago peacefully.
We're goin' peacefully.

52
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,166
But if we're met there with violence,

53
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,583
you better believe that we're gonna
meet that violence with…

54
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:43,083
Nonviolence. Always nonviolence,
and that's without exception.

55
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,541
- [boy] What if the police hit you?
- [David] Why would the police hit me?

56
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,833
- What if they do?
- I'll duck.

57
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,875
David, he watches the news.

58
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,250
I've organized 100 protests.

59
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,125
This one will be no different
in that it almost certainly won't work.

60
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,291
The police are...

61
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,166
I'm not worried about them.
I'm worried about Hoffman and Rubin.

62
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,583
It's the Democratic
National Convention, honey.

63
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,083
Every camera in America
is gonna be pointed at it,

64
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,375
and Daley is not gonna let his city
turn into a theater of war.

65
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,125
Hoffman and Rubin
are geniuses in their own special way.

66
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,416
- Oh, dear God.
- He's got a Boy Scout meeting at 7:00.

67
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,791
Dad, if the police...

68
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,166
If the police try to arrest me,

69
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,458
I'll do what I always do and what
I taught you to do, which is what?

70
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,875
Very calmly and very politely…

71
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,333
Fuck the motherfuckers up!
They leave us alone and everything's cool.

72
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,875
They tangle, disrupt, intimidate,

73
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,000
play fast and loose
with the First Amendment,

74
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,500
start breaking heads,
then we will not be on our way.

75
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,250
You can't give this speech in Chicago.

76
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,791
- Fred wants me there. Plane ticket.
- Let Fred give the speech.

77
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,083
Between Hayden and Hoffman,
there could be 5,000 people.

78
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,625
Be nice to talk to 5,000 people.

79
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,500
Not while you're in trouble
in Connecticut.

80
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,750
I'm the head
of the Black Panthers, Sondra.

81
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,750
When won't I be in trouble? Travel bag.

82
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,875
You'll be in a lot more of it
if you stand up and say, "Fry the pigs."

83
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,750
If they attack. Takin' it out of context.

84
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,166
So will every white person in America.
Cops won't give a shit about context.

85
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,791
You don't have protection in Chicago.

86
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,416
There's no place to be but in it.

87
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,416
- But "fry the pigs"?
- If they attack...

88
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,958
- Dr. King...
- Is dead.

89
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,833
He has a dream?
Now he has a fuckin' bullet in his head.

90
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,958
Martin's dead, Malcolm's dead,
Medgar's dead,

91
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,791
Bobby's dead, Jesus is dead.

92
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,333
They tried it peacefully,
we gonna try something else.

93
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,208
Sondra, I'll be there for four hours.
That's it.

94
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,583
Snack.

95
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,916
You'll at least take one of these?

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,041
If I knew how to use that,
I wouldn't need to be making speeches.

97
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:34,541
It's named after the Russian commissar
Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov.

98
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,041
You start with a glass bottle.

99
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,083
You fill it up halfway
with gasoline and motor oil…

100
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,500
You pack some Styrofoam,
and now your cherry bomb.

101
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,708
Some chewing gum around the top…

102
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,958
…and a fuse.

103
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,041

- Anyone tell you what this is about?

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,708
No, sir. Just to meet Mr. Foran at O'Hare

- We'd be meeting Mr. Mitchell.
- Good.

Finally changing that goddamn picture.
Come on in.

142
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,500
[Mitchell] As a matter
of courtesy and tradition,

143
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,125
when we elect a new president,
the outgoing cabinet members resign

144
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,291
to spare the new president
the unpleasantness of firing 'em.

145
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,041
Richard, do you know when President Nixon

146
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,000
received Ramsey Clark's
formal letter of resignation?

147
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,125
- No, sir.
- About an hour before my confirmation.

148
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,791
That was to embarrass me.

149
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,250
I don't know, I think it was
more embarrassing for Ramsey Clark.

150
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,250
I'm John Mitchell.

151
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,958
Thomas Foran, Mr. Attorney General,

152
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,708
Richard, Chicago is more fucked up than
any ten things I've ever seen in my life.

153
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,666
- [Schultz] Sir?
- The convention, the riots.

154
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,375
- Yes, sir.
- [Mitchell] Sit.

155
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,833
- Johnnie Walker okay with everybody?
- Yes, thank you.

156
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,625
- Richard?
- Nothing for me, thank you.

157
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,000
We don't know how Humphrey's people
could have been that stupid.

158

- Son, are you nervous?

- No, sir.
- Why the fuck not?

161
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,208
[chuckles] I'm kidding. Don't believe
everything you've heard about me.

162
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:19,583

on the way out the door. [scoffs]

00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,916
I'm asking if you think Chicago
was why Humphrey lost the election.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,500
No, sir.
The Republicans ran a better candidate.

165
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,703
- That's for damn sure.
- Daley didn't help his party,

166
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,875
but Humphrey's people
and Daley didn't break the law,

167
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,333
so that's somebody else's table.

168
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,916
As a matter of fact, we don't believe
any federal laws were broken last summer.

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,916
Mr. Foran had our office
run a thorough investigation.

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,458
There was trespassing, destruction
of public property, lewd behavior.

171
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,500
Nothing that would rise to the level...

172
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,208
You think you and your boss
are in the attorney general's office

173
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:50,458
because I want you to seek an indictment
for violating a federal trespassing law?

174
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,708
Our office wasn't aware
that the Justice Department

175
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,416
wanted to seek any indictments at all.

176
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,416
- We do.
- Ramsey Clark was dead set against...

177
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,791
Ramsey Clark doesn't run
the Justice Department anymore,

178
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,958
did you hear about that?

179
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,583
- And Mr. Johnson's back home in Texas.
- Of course, sir.

180
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,125
One hour before
my confirmation hearing gaveled,

181
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,500
that's when he resigned. What a prick!

182
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,500
That's unprofessional.

183
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,666
Unprofessional? It was unpatriotic.
I'll tell you what else.

184
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,250
It was impolite.
There's such a thing as manners.

185
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,708
I want to bring back manners.
How about that? The America I grew up in.

186
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,791
Will you help me, Mr. Schultz?

187
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,041
'Cause I asked Mr. Foran
who was the best prosecutor in his office.

188
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,875
- He said you.
- Thank you.

189
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,875
Section 2101 of Title 18.

190
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,916
That's the federal law that was broken.

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,625
That's the Rap Brown Law.

192
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,333
In conspiracy to cross state lines
in order to incite violence.

193
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,458
Comes with a maximum of ten years.
We want all ten.

194
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,666
- For whom, sir?
- The all-star team.

195
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,333
"Abbie Hoffman, Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin,
David Dellinger, Rennie Davis,

196
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:54,166
Lee Weiner, John Froines…
and Bobby Seale?"

197
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,250
I call 'em the school boys, and when I do,
everyone here knows who I'm talking about.

198
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,166
Petulant and dangerous.

199
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,833
And we watched for a decade
while these rebels without a job,

200
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,541
who never got their hands dirty
fighting the enemy,

201
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,041
tell us how to prosecute a war.

202
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,000
The decade's over, the grown-ups are back,

203
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,750
and I deem these shitty little fairies
to be a threat to national security.

204
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,375
So they're gonna spend their thirties
in a federal facility.

205
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,708
- Real-time.
- [Foran] You're lead prosecutor, Richard.

206
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,666
You understand
why I couldn't tell you until we got here?

207
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,833
Sure. Of course, sir.

208
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:31,083
Richard, you're being handed the ball.
Are you ready for this?

209
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,916
You pay me for my opinion.

210
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,916
- What?
- I said, sir, you pay me for my opinion.

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,583
Where'd you learn that?
In class? I pay you to win.

212
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,166
I'm not sure we can get
a good indictment on conspiracy.

213
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,958
- Why not?
- Some of them have never met each other.

214
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,291
Telephones.

215
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:53,458
Mr. Attorney General, the Rap Brown Law
was created by Southern whites in Congress

216
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,916
to limit the free speech
of Black activists.

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,166
- Civil rights activists...
- I know why it was passed.

218
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,791
Why the fuck is he teaching…

219
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,041
It doesn't matter why it was passed.
It matters what it can do.

220
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,916
We're not sure what it can do.
No one's ever been charged with it.

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,416
[Foran] That makes it exciting.

222
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,208
It's like virgin land.
Undeveloped real estate.

223
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,500
- It's a law and they broke it.
- Of course, sir.

224
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,833
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.

225
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,916
Say what you want to say,
since I'm paying for your wisdom.

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,333
Give me my money's worth.

227
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,208
Sir, there are people who will see this

228
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,583
as the Justice Department
restraining free speech

229
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,500
and there were people
who see these men as martyrs.

230
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,875
- Are any of those people in this room?
- No, sir.

231
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,666
You're 33 and you're about
to be named lead prosecutor

232
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,916
in the most important trial
in your lifetime

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,875
after being handpicked
by the attorney general.

234
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,791
I'm about to do that right now.

235
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,958
But before I do, let me ask you,
how do <i>you</i> see them?

236
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,166
- Personally or in terms of...
- [Mitchell] Personally.

237
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,583
I see them as vulgar, anti-establishment,

238
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:52,291
antisocial and unpragmatic,
but none of those things are indictable.

239
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,833
Imagine how impressed I'll be
when you get an indictment.

240
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,458
- There's a bigger question.
- Which is?

241
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:01,375
Who started the riots?
Was it the protesters or the police?

242
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,666
- The police don't start riots.
- They'll have witnesses who say they did.

243
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,875
And you'll dismantle them and win,

244
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,208
because, Mr. Schultz,
that's what's expected of you.

245
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,375
[Foran] You didn't show
a lot of gratitude in there.

246
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,333
[Schultz sighs]

247
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:20,750
On top of everything, we're giving them
what they want: a stage and an audience.

248
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,500
You think there's gonna be a big audience?

249
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,125
[crowd chanting]
<i>The whole world is watching!</i>

250
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,458
Yes, sir, I do.

251
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:33,583
[crowd chanting]
The whole world is watching!

252
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,458
- [protestor 1] Traitors!
- [protestor 2] Lock up the longhairs!

253
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,541
[protestor 3] Power to the people!

254
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,083
[protestor 4] No more war!

255
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,458
[crowd] The whole world is watching!

256
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,583
Get out! How dare you? Get out!

257
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,083
- [man 1] Abbie!
- Are you all right?

258
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,291
[man 2] Abbie, over here.

259
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,708
- I was, until I saw that.
- Most of them are on our side.

260
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,875
- [man 2] We love you, Abbie!
- See?

261
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:01,916
[woman] Watch out!

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,750
Jesus Christ! How did you do that?

263
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,625
Experience.

264
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,708
[reporter 1] Abbie, right over here!

265
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,208
Over here! Over here!

266
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,166
You don't know what to do
with the egg now?

267
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,083
No.

268
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,291
[elevator bell dings]

269
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,750
- [reporter 2] Mr. Kunstler, one question!
- [reporter 3] Bill! Bill!

270
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,416
All right. Hang on. Quiet down.

271
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,958
I want you all to meet
a new addition to the defense team.

272
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,166
This is Leonard Weinglass,

273
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,458
one of this country's most
talented First Amendment litigators.

274
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,000
- Bill, can you tell us...
- Go ahead, Sy.

275
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,541
What's the status of Charles Garry?

276
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,375
Charles Garry is still in the hospital.

277
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,375
You should contact his office
for information.

278
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,958
- [reporter 4] One more.
- Marjorie.

279
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,791
You're representing Bobby Seale today?

280
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,833
Oh, no, it's very important
that it be understood that, uh,

281
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,541
for his own protection,
his own protection,

282
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,541
I will not be acting as
Bobby Seale's attorney today.

283
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,458
One more. Jack.

284
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:59,291
I was told that Hayden was the one
who wanted to bring Mr. Weinglass in,

285
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,041
that Hayden has concerns
about your seriousness.

286
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,625
- Well…
- This is William Kunstler.

287
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,833
You wanna find out how serious he is,
meet him at a witness stand.

288
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,875
[indistinct chatter]

289
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,458
I understand why they're tryin'
to smoke Abbie, Jerry and Hayden,

290
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,875
even Rennie and Dellinger,

291
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,833
but I can't figure out
what the two of us are doin' here.

292
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,708
I feel exactly the same way, but
this is the Academy Awards of protests,

293
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,041
and as far as I'm concerned,
it's an honor just to be nominated.

294
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
What is that?

295
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,041
I've been keeping a list every day.

296
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,583
Americans who've been killed
since the day we were arrested.

297
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,666
Why?

298
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,958
With the trial starting, it might get easy
to forget who this is about.

299
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,666
- [Bill] Fellas.
- Morning.

300
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,750
Good morning.

301
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,583
I just got a question
about my seriousness.

302
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:34,625
Whatever's going on between you and Abbie,
could you keep it out of this building?

303
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,708
- I got a feeling this is gearing up to be…
- [door opens]

304
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,875
- [door closes]
- [footsteps approaching]

305
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,375
[spectators murmuring]

306
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,166
- Fred.
- Bill.

307
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,833
Did you have breakfast this morning?

308
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,250
- What?
- Did you have breakfast?

309
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,250
- I did.
- Well, what'd you have?

310
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:14,916
What are you doin'?

311
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,500
I'm talkin' to him about breakfast

312
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,125
because that's all I'm allowed
to talk to him about.

313
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,208
That's right.

314
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,958
- Bobby...
- We have instructions from our lawyer.

315
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,708
If you need me, I'm sittin' right there.

316
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,708
You just look at me
and you say, "I need you."

317
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,333
- We don't need you, Bill.
- You two gonna be like this?

318
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,208
Your friends shouldn't sit together.
The jury's not gonna like that.

319
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,083
This isn't my jury.
If they don't like it...

320
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,208
No, he's right.

321
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,916
Spread out, okay? In pairs.

322
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,541
[Bill] And Fred?

323
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,291
- No, they're dressed just fine.
- It's all right.

324
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,625
And take your very scary hats off.

325
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,666
Don't mess this up.

326
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,833
All right. Good pep talk.

327
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Hey!

328
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,291
You see the crowd out there?

329
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,458
I have an egg.

330
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,875
- Get rid of that.
- You don't think I want to?

331
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,708
It's like we're… What's his name?
We just met him.

332
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,750
- Yeah.
- What is his name?

333
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,333
- Who?
- The drummer. The greatest drummer ever.

334
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,250
Gene Krupa?

335
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,125
No. Gene Krupa? I'm talkin' about
the drummer from Cream.

336
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,625
We just met him last night.

337
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,625
- Ginger Baker.
- Thank you.

338
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,666
Crowd outside is so big, it's as if
we're Ginger Baker, I was trying to say.

339
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,875
- Are you stoned?
- Yeah. You?

340
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,375
All right, sit down.

341
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,416
You remember what I said.

342
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,666
Okay, and you remember
to keep us out of prison.

343
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,583
[Bill] There's a lot of good advice
this morning.

344
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,708
[bailiff] All rise.

345
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:10,500
Hear ye, hear ye.
September 26th, 1969, ten o'clock a.m.

346
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,375
All persons having business
before the United States District Court

347
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,833
of Northern Illinois,
Southern District, Eastern Division,

348
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,791
draw near and ye shall be heard.

349
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,875
Judge Julius Hoffman presiding.

350
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,791
God save the United States of America
and this Honorable Court.

351
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,083
Be seated.

352
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,666
Mr. Marshal, bring in our jury.

353
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,458
Let the record show
that we have been joined

354
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:48,083
by our 12 jurors and four alternates.

355
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,500
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

356
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,041
Good morning.

357
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,750
Mrs. Winter, please call the case.

358
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,750
69 CR 180,

359
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,375
United States of America
v. David Dellinger,

360
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,541
Rennard C. Davis, Thomas Hayden,

361
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,791
Abbott Hoffman, Jerry C. Rubin,

362
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:15,625
Lee Weiner, John R. Froines
and Bobby G. Seale for trial.

363
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,041
Are the People ready
to make opening arguments?

364
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,125
We are, Your Honor.

365
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,375
- I don't have my lawyer here.
- It's not your turn to speak.

366
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,250
My trial's begun without my lawyer.

367
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,833
- Please sit.
- [spectators murmuring]

368
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:32,875
Mr. Schultz?

369
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,541
Good morning.
My name is Richard Schultz.

370
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,625
I'm an assistant US attorney
for the Southern District of Illinois.

371
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,583
Seated at my table is my boss,
US Attorney Thomas Foran.

372
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,958
Or you could say, I'm seated at his table.

373
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,291
[jurors chuckle softly]

374
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,916
At the defense table
are the eight defendants

375
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,458
represented by their lawyers
William Kunstler, Leonard Weinglass.

376
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,708
Now, the defendants would tell you that
they represent three different groups.

377
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,375
- They would tell you that one group is...
- [Hoffman] Excuse me.

378
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,000
Yes, sir.

379
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,208
I'd like to clarify something
for the jurors.

380
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,041
There are two Hoffmans in this courtroom.

381
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:14,791
The defendant Abbie Hoffman
and myself, Judge Julius Hoffman.

382
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,583
Thank you, sir.

383
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,166
I didn't want there to be
confusion on the matter.

384
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,500
Man, I don't think
they're gonna mix us up.

385
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,000
[spectators laughing]

386
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,833
You will address this court
as Judge or Your Honor,

387
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,833
and you will not
address this court until…

388
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,666
You will not address this court!

389
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,250
The defendants would tell you
they represent three different groups.

390
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,500
[Hoffman] And the record should reflect

391
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,583
that defendant Hoffman and I
are not related.

392
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,083
Father, no!

393
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,559
- [spectators laugh]
- [gavel bangs]

394
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,708
Mr. Hoffman, are you familiar
with contempt of court?

395
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,541
- It's practically a religion for me, sir.
- [spectators laugh]

396
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,750
- Your Honor?
- Continue.

397
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,500
Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden
are the leaders of the SDS,

398
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,375
Students for a Democratic Society.

399
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,708
Davis and Hayden
brought their people to Chicago

400
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,500
for the purpose
of causing violence in the streets

401
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,166
in order to disrupt
the Democratic Convention.

402
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,125
You know the Youth International Party
as the Yippies.

403
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,541
Their leaders are
Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.

404
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:23,000
Bobby Seale is the leader
of the Black Panther Party.

405
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,416
Again, the defendants would tell you
that these are three distinct groups.

406
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,333
- But they all...
- [Bobby] Excuse me.

407
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,250
[Hoffman] Yes.

408
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,458
- May I speak?
- [Hoffman] No, sir.

409
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,625
He just said my name.

410
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:37,458
You're a defendant in this case.
You're likely to hear your name.

411
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:41,291
I have a right to counsel,
and His Honor knows that.

412
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:45,541
Don't tell the court what it does
and does not know. Be seated.

413
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,250
Mr. Schultz.

414
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,625
The radical left. That's all.

415
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,750
They're the radical left
in different costumes.

416
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,583
These defendants had a plan,

417
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:02,500
and a plan among two or more people
is a conspiracy.

418
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,708
The defendants crossed state lines
to execute their plan.

419
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:09,333
That's why we're in federal court,
and the plan was to incite a riot,

420
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,750
and there's one thing you already know.

421
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,583
They succeeded.

422
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:18,708
Excuse me. Have we identified
the other defendants for the record?

423
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,208
A Mr… Wiener.

424
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,666
Weiner.

425
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,250
- [spectators laugh]
- [Hoffman] Mr. Froines and Mr. Dillinger.

426
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,458
Dellinger, Your Honor.

427
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,291
What's going on here?

428
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,750
Uh, you're referring
to the defendant Dellinger.

429
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:34,083
- Derringer.
- Um, it's Dellinger, sir.

430
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:39,291
Note the prosecution was referring
to the defendant Derringer.

431
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,916
- Not Dellinger.
- It is Dellinger, Your Honor.

432
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,916
[Hoffman] Can we straighten this out?

433
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,833
Sure. Dillinger was a bank robber.
Derringer is a gun.

434
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,916
He's David Dellinger,
and the judge and I are not related.

435
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,500
Your Honor, I'd like to caution the court
that this kind of disruption

436
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:58,166
and display of disrespect
will be a continuing tactic for defense.

437
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,500
[Bill] Sir, it's not a tactic.
At the moment,

438
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:03,750
the defendants are the only ones
on record as knowing their own names.

439
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,583
[Hoffman] Be seated, Mr. Schultz…

440
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,833
Uh, Mr. Kunstler.

441
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,291
I object to being characterized
as a member of this group.

442
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,708
- Who is your lawyer?
- [Bobby] Charles R. Garry.

443
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,625
Is Mr. Garry here today?

444
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,083
- No, he is not.
- Your Honor...

445
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,708
Are you representing Mr. Seale?

446
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,541
- No, sir.
- [Hoffman] Then, sit.

447
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,083
- Mr. Schultz, forgive me.
- [indistinct conversation]

448
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,791
Have you concluded your opening statement?

449
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:30,833
Yes, Your Honor.

450
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,583
My lawyer Charles Garry
is in a hospital in Oakland

451
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,541
having undergone gallbladder surgery.

452
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,791
[Hoffman] Mr. Kunstler.

453
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,666
You are sitting right next to the man.

454
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,125
Just represent him.
It's the same case.

455
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:45,041
The fact that there's a lawyer
near Mr. Seale

456
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,625
does not satisfy
the requirements of due process.

457
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:48,791
I have a right...

458
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:53,833
A motion was made for postponement
due to Mr. Garry's medical condition.

459
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:56,625
I was there.
Your Honor denied that motion.

460
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,791
Therefore, Mr. Seale is here
without legal representation.

461
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:04,666
I don't care
for your general tone, Mr. Kunstler.

462
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,041
I meant no disrespect to the court.

463
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:11,583
I'm trying to be clear that I can't muddy
Mr. Seale's grounds for appeal

464
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,500
by appearing to speak as his lawyer.

465
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:17,041
I don't ask you to compromise
Mr. Seale's position, sir.

466
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:21,416
But I will not permit him
to address the jury

467
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,958
when his perfectly competent lawyer
is sitting...

468
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:26,416
For the fourth time,
he's not Bobby's lawyer.

469
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,291
You're, uh… Mr. Rubin.

470
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,041
Yes, sir.

471
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,583
Don't ever do that again!

472
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,166
[Bobby] Your Honor,
I'm not with these guys.

473
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,250
I never met most of them
until the indictment.

474
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,666
- We will have order.
- There are eight of us here.

475
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,708
There are signs out there that read,
"Free the Chicago 7." I'm not with them!

476
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:52,791
- Mr. Marshal, will you seat Mr. Seale?
- Conspiracy? I never met most of them.

477
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:56,500
Frankly, the US attorney wanted
a Negro defendant to scare the jury.

478
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:59,000
I was thrown in
to make the group look scarier.

479
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,125
I came to Chicago. I made a speech!

480
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,958
- Mr. Seale...
- I had a chicken pot pie,

481
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:05,375
went to the airport
and I flew back to Oakland,

482
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,000
that's why they call it the Chicago…

483
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,916
- [gavel banging]
- Get your hands off me!

484
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,833
Charge Mr. Seale
with one count of contempt of court.

485
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,875
[door slams]

486
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,208
We have to make a decision right now,

487
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:44,333
a decision I assumed we'd already made
four months ago when trial prep began.

488
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:48,666
Are we using this trial to defend
ourselves against very serious charges

489
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,500
that could land us in prison
for ten years?

490
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:54,500
Or to say a pointless "fuck you"
to the establishment?

491
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:57,666
- Fuck you!
- That is what I was afraid…

492
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:01,541
- Were you saying "fuck you" or answering...
- I was also confused.

493
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:05,125
If we leave without saying anything
about why we came in the first place,

494
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,291
it'll be heartbreaking.

495
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,708
If the jury finds us guilty,
we're not leaving at all.

496
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,375
The only thing we need to say
about why we came here

497
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,208
is it wasn't to incite violence.

498
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm with Jerry.

499
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,708
- Why?
- The trial shouldn't be about us.

500
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:22,250
I would love it if it wasn't about us,
but it definitely is. John? Lee?

501
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,625
Does anyone think our judge is crazy?

502
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,166
- He isn't our problem.
- Give it time. He will be.

503
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,166
I'm talking about us.
Abbie, you cannot talk back to the judge.

504
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,583
- And, Jerry… Jesus!
- Did you get a haircut just for court?

505
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,916
- I did.
- A haircut for the judge. That is…

506
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,000
[laughs] I can't even. That is…

507
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,750
That is so foreign to me.

508
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,333
- So is soap.
- Zing.

509
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:48,583
Let me explain something. It took
you two less than five minutes

510
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:52,416
to make us look exactly like what Schultz
is trying to make us look like.

511
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,625
I don't have a problem
with what we look like.

512
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,291
Jerry likes what we look like. Uh, John?

513
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,458
- Lee?
- Yeah.

514
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:02,125
- I feel like I'm ten pounds too heavy.
- I don't like it when we fight.

515
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,000
- Rennie?
- Tom should be heard.

516
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,083
[Abbie] And he was.

517
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:10,125
When we walked in here, they were chanting
that the whole world is watching.

518
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,916
This is it. We're on.

519
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,166
This is what revolution looks like.
Real revolution. Cultural revolution.

520
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,791
Why did you come here?

521
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,791
I got an invitation from a grand jury.

522
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,916
Last summer.
Why did you come to the convention?

523
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,416
To end the war.

524
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,750
Guys, before you tether yourselves
to this man,

525
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:30,250
just know the very last thing he wants
is for the war to end.

526
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:35,333
I don't have time for cultural revolution.
It distracts from actual revolution.

527
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,250
All right, all right, all right.

528
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,250
[Abbie] But you got time for a haircut.

529
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,250
Has everybody got everything
off their chest?

530
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,416
- What in the name of hell was that?
- Evidently not.

531
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,958
[Fred] You spoke for Bobby.

532
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,458
I made it very clear
that I'm not his lawyer.

533
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,861
- I'd like to sit in on these meetings.
- [Bill] You can't.

534
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,625
- I think I will anyway.
- Fred...

535
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,958
Bobby's life is at stake.
You're playing to the crowd.

536
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,750
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

537
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:00,541
White guys sitting in a furnished room
eating sandwiches while Bobby's in a cell.

538
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,791
White guys are free on bail.
Bobby's locked up

539
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,666
because he's under arrest
in Connecticut for killing a cop.

540
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,625
It's not like he refused
to give up his seat on a bus.

541
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:12,458
Convince him to let Bill and me
represent him, just for today, at least.

542
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,000
- The judge is...
- Fucking nuts.

543
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:17,291
A little hostile.
I'm sure Garry didn't anticipate that.

544
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,583
He's innocent in Connecticut.

545
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,541
- All right.
- He's never killed anyone.

546
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,000
- It's important that you all know that.
- Okay.

547
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:28,166
All right, you gotta try to convince him.

548
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,041
I can't.

549
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:33,583
- [Bill] Well, try.
- I have!

550
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,708
Well, keep trying, all right?

551
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,166
We're back.

552
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:39,833
Let's go.

553
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,666
Jerry, Abbie,
unless you're asked a direct question,

554
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,208
I want you
to keep your mouths shut in that room.

555
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,291
- [Abbie] This is a political trial.
- What?

556
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,875
This is a political trial
that was already decided for us.

557
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,083
Ignoring that reality is just weird to me.

558
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:58,375
There are civil trials
and there are criminal trials.

559
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,666
There's no such thing
as a political trial.

560
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,833
Okay.

561
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,291
Abbie's smarter than you think he is.

562
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:24,333
Cows are smarter than I think he is.

563
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,041
- S-T-A-H-L.
- [Schultz] What is your occupation?

564
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,875
I am the mayor's administrative officer.

565
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:36,791
Calling your attention to March 26, 1968.
Did you have a meeting on that day?

566
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,500
- Yes.
- Uh, with whom?

567
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,875
- Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin, is it?
- Abbie and Jerry is fine.

568
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,375
What was said at that meeting?

569
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:47,333
I was told the Youth International Party
would be holding a festival of life

570
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,750
during the Democratic National Convention.

571
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:52,166
There would be thousands
of young people attending

572
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,291
and there'd be rock bands
playing in the park.

573
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,666
Music will be performed.

574
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,666
- Rock music?
- I would think.

575
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,333
They also said
there would be public fornication.

576
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:01,583
Say that again, sir?

577
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,125
Public fornication.

578
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,708
You're asking
for a Parks permit for public...

579
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,041
- Yeah.
- And rock music.

580
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,041
No, of course not.

581
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,250
What if it was R&B?

582
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:12,125
- Did you issue the permits?
- No, I did not.

583
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:17,583
And what, if anything, did Abbie Hoffman
say when you denied their request?

584
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,958
Mr. Stahl, you need
to understand something.

585
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:24,625
There's gonna be a festival of life
in Grant Park held during the convention.

586
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:28,458
Bands will play rock music.
There will be public fornication.

587
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,291
Likely some of it with the wives
and mistresses of delegates.

588
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:35,166
Psychedelic, long-haired leftists
will consort with dope users.

589
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,375
And we'll insist that
the next president of the US

590
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,625
stops sending our friends
to be slaughtered.

591
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:43,125
This will happen
whether you give us the permit or not.

592
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:45,791
Hotels will be filled with delegates.
Where will people sleep?

593
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,541
Some will sleep in tents,
others will live frivolously.

594
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,583
- How many people are coming?
- A lot.

595
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,958
What's a lot? A thousand? Two thousand?

596
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,041
Ten thousand.

597
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,250
- Jesus Christ.
- Right?

598
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,166
Did Abbie Hoffman add anything
at the end of the meeting?

599
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,250
Yes.

600
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:04,083
- [Schultz] What did he say?
- He said…

601
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:07,000
Or you give me 100 grand
and I could call the whole thing off.

602
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,125
Thank you.

603
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,125
Mr. Fineglass.

604
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,000
Uh, Weinglass, sir.

605
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:18,500
Mr. Stahl, the meeting you just described
with Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin,

606
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,750
was that the only meeting you had
with any of the defendants?

607
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:22,833
No.

608
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:26,541
On August 2nd, you had a meeting
with Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis.

609
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,125
- Tom Hayden.
- Rennie Davis.

610
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,958
On August 12th,
you had a meeting with David Dellinger.

611
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,416
I'll tell you the same thing
I told the others.

612
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,041
There were two more meetings
with Tom and Rennie

613
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,333
on the 10th and 12th of August,

614
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:43,041
and one more meeting
with David Dellinger on the 26th.

615
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,291
I can't be sure of the dates.

616
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:47,625
Well, I can be sure.
They're recorded in the log at City Hall.

617
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:48,708
Okay…

618
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,833
And in each of the meetings,
a request was made for a permit

619
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:55,708
to demonstrate in Grant Park
during the convention.

620
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,958
Mr. Stahl,
we intend a peaceful demonstration.

621
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:02,041
We're not interested in violence
or disturbing the delegates.

622
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:05,958
And in each of the meetings,
the request for permits was denied.

623
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:08,916
Listen, I'll tell you the same thing
I told Mr. Hoffman

624
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,791
and Mr. Rubin and Mr. Dellinger.

625
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,083
No demonstrations
within sight of the Hilton.

626
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:16,041
We have to demonstrate there.
That's where the convention is.

627
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,750
There will be no demonstrations
within sight of the Hilton.

628
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,083
Okay. But the thing is, there will be.

629
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,291
- Are you threatening me, Mr. Hayden?
- No.

630
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,833
We're not threatening you.
We're cautioning you.

631
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:28,750
Thousands of people are coming to Chicago.

632
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,833
If they're not given
a place to demonstrate,

633
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:32,833
they'll demonstrate wherever they stand.

634
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:35,041
So it's reckless, irresponsible,

635
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:38,166
and foolishly dangerous of the city
not to have a contingency plan.

636
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,666
We're gonna need
police security, first aid…

637
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,458
- Traffic control.
- Water, sanitation.

638
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:47,125
So, five times,
you were asked for a permit.

639
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,125
Five times,
you were advised of the dangers

640
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,666
of not providing
a location to demonstrate...

641
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,041
I don't take my instructions
from the defendants.

642
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,485
- No, you don't.
- [Stahl] I don't.

643
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,083
You take them from Mayor Daley.

644
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,125
You're appointed by the mayor
and you serve at his pleasure?

645
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,041
Yes.

646
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:06,250
And you're subject to removal
in the same manner by the mayor?

647
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,833
- Yes.
- Thank you.

648
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,791
Further cross-examination, Mr. Kunstler.

649
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:14,416
Yes, sir. Mr. Stahl. When Abbie...

650
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,666
Excuse me.

651
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,375
Mr. Seale, would you identify
the man sitting behind you?

652
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,875
- No, sir.
- No?

653
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,125
- That's right.
- Why not?

654
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,875
He's not on trial here.

655
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:31,125
- Mr. Seale, identify the man behind you.
- [whispering indistinctly]

656
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,291
His name is Fred Hampton.

657
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,875
[Hoffman] Let the record indicate

658
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:42,041
that Mr. Hampton is head of the Chicago
chapter of the Black Panther Party.

659
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:46,291
Your Honor, Mr. Hampton isn't at the bar.
Why is the record identifying him at all?

660
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,625
Mr. Hampton is clearly
giving Mr. Seale legal advice.

661
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,958
My lawyer is Charles Garry.

662
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,583
Excuse me, sir, but for all you know,

663
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,625
Mr. Hampton is giving Mr. Seale
the score of the White Sox game.

664
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:59,000
- I will assume that he is not.
- Why?

665
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:02,958
Because that's what happens
when you don't have a lawyer.

666
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:06,416
The court assumes
that you are being represented

667
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,500
by the Black Panther sitting behind you.

668
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:12,208
[spectators murmuring]

669
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:13,791
Continue.

670
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:19,333
Mr. Stahl, when Abbie offered
to call the whole thing off for $100,000,

671
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:23,708
did you think that he was serious
or did you think he was making a joke?

672
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,625
I had no reason
not to think he was serious.

673
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,333
- Really? Do you know what extortion is?
- Yes.

674
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,000
- Do you know it's a felony?
- Yes.

675
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,125
Okay. So, when you called the FBI

676
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:36,916
and told 'em about Mr. Hoffman's attempt
to extort a government employee,

677
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,958
- what'd they say?
- I didn't call the FBI.

678
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:42,125
Sorry. When you called the US attorney
and reported attempted extortion,

679
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,541
- what'd their office say?
- I didn't call the US att...

680
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,041
- Cooke County DA. Did you call them?
- No, sir.

681
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,000
- The chief of police?
- Mr. Kunstler...

682
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,625
The police officer posted
outside the mayor's office?

683
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:55,083
How about the mayor?
Mr. Stahl, I'm gonna ask you again.

684
00:35:55,666 --> 00:36:01,458
When Abbie Hoffman asked
for $100,000 to call the whole thing off,

685
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:06,000
did you think that he was serious
or did you know that he was making a joke?

686
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,958
I had no reason
not to believe he was serious.

687
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,333
Then, along with extortion,
did you know that perjury is a crime?

688
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,708
- Objection.
- Sustained, and strike it.

689
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:15,708
In fact,

690
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:19,875
strike the entirety of Mr. Stahl's
testimony under cross-examination,

691
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:22,750
and the jury is instructed
to disregard it.

692
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:25,791
You're gonna strike
the entire cross-examination?

693
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,666
I gave you
and co-counsel Fineglass ample...

694
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,666
Co-counsel's name is Weinglass.

695
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,125
Mr. Stahl's testimony
under cross-examination is entirely...

696
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:36,833
You are interrupting
the court again, Mr. Kunstler.

697
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:38,750
Move to reinstate testimony.

698
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,041
[defendants] Overruled.

699
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,708
[spectators murmuring]

700
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:47,166
- Overruled.
- Exception.

701
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,916
Noted. Are there any further questions?

702
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,708
Yes. So, Mr. Stahl,
in any of these meetings,

703
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:57,375
did any of the defendants say
that if you didn't grant them permits,

704
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,958
that they would do
violent acts to the city?

705
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:05,500
Yes, they said the Parks permit should be
issued in order to minimize destruction.

706
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,333
Did they indicate from whom
this destruction would come?

707
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:12,041
The destruction did not come
from the Chicago Police Department,

708
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,875
if that's what you're suggesting.

709
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,416
No further questions.

710
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,750
I'd like to cross-examine
the witness, Your Honor.

711
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,583
- [Hoffman] You may not.
- Have you met me?

712
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:22,833
Sit, Mr. Seale.

713
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,500
Are you guilty of conspiracy?

714
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,625
We believe that we are innocent.

715
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:36,416
The people who are guilty of conspiracy
are the fuckers who put us on trial.

716
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,041
They are responsible for the bloodshed
that flowed in the streets of Chicago.

717
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,541
Why won't Bobby Seale
let anyone represent him?

718
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,000
You've posed that question
in the form of a lie.

719
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,500
[reporters clamor]

720
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:53,416
[telephone ringing]

721
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,416
[woman]
Conspiracy Office. Can you hold on?

722
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,833
[telephones continue ringing]

723
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:59,958
Conspiracy Office. Can you hold on?

724
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,750
Conspiracy Office. Can you hold on?

725
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:11,333
Maybe you don't want to call it
the, uh, Conspiracy Office.

726
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,416
They understand irony
and appreciate the humor.

727
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,083
- I wouldn't count on it.
- Most people are smart, Bill.

728
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:19,583
If you believe that, you'll get your
heart broken every day of your life.

729
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:23,083
- [telephone rings]
- Hang on. Hi, how can I help you?

730
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,000
Messages?

731
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:27,333
We sure do take contributions.
We've got high-priced lawyers.

732
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:29,125
High-priced lawyers are working for free.

733
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,208
- It's the support staff.
- We can't take grass.

734
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,458
- [Abbie] Hey!
- Yeah.

735
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,708
- Abbie says we'll take the weed.
- [Bill] Messages?

736
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:37,083
Let me give you our mailing address.

737
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,958
We are in Hyde Park,

738
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:43,708
28 East Jackson Street,
Chicago, Illinois. 60604…

739
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:48,166
I don't want you guys
holding any more press conferences.

740
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,958
If you're gonna get between Abbie
and a camera, I'd wear pads and a helmet.

741
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:54,541
We had a good day, Len.
Tell him we had a good day.

742
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,458
Six and eleven.

743
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,750
[Tom] What does that mean?

744
00:38:56,833 --> 00:39:00,083
- Jurors six and eleven. They're with us.
- How do you know?

745
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,833
Six made sure I saw a copy
of a James Baldwin novel under her arm,

746
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:06,375
and eleven's been nodding
during the Stahl cross.

747
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:07,708
Falling asleep?

748
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,583
Nodding. Agreeing.

749
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,791
No more press conferences.

750
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,791
[press conference playing on TV]

751
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,083
[Jerry] <i>You posed that question
in the form of a lie.</i>

752
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:19,541
<i>Bobby Seale's lawyer is Charles Garry.
He's in the hospital right now.</i>

753
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,291
<i>A motion was made for postponement
and it was denied.</i>

754
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,750
[reporter] <i>Would you have taken
$100,000 to call it off?</i>

755
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:27,916
<i>Yeah, sure. I would have taken $100,000.</i>

756
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,541
<i>As for calling it off…</i>

757
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,906
[reporter] <i>How much is it worth to you?
What's your price?</i>

758
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:33,375
[Abbie] <i>To call off the revolution?</i>

759
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,666
[reporter] <i>What's your price?</i>

760
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:39,583
<i>My life.</i>

761
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,958
[softly] Any idea what's going on?

762
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,333
It's been years since I've had
any idea what was going on.

763
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,833
I'm going to adjourn the court for the day

764
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,583
and see counsel
in my chambers in 15 minutes.

765
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,916
[bailiff] All rise.

766
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,708
Gentlemen, it's been
brought to my attention

767
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:46,833
that two jurors received threatening notes

768
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:49,875
from a member or members
of the Black Panther Party.

769
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:50,958
Which two jurors?

770
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,416
Juror number six and juror number eleven.

771
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:57,750
These were slipped into the mail
at the homes of their parents.

772
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,541
Bring in juror six.

773
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:03,791
Six and eleven?

774
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,333
- Yes.
- Judge, I wonder if we could draw...

775
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:08,916
Juror number six, how are you?

776
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:10,708
I'm fine.

777
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,375
- [Bill] Before we talk...
- Please.

778
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,208
Your parents received this note
this morning in their mail.

779
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,708
They called the police,
as they should have done.

780
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:20,291
I'd like you to take the note
and read it out loud.

781
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,833
My parents?

782
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,208
- [Bill] Your Honor, before she...
- Please read the note.

783
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,416
"We're watching you."

784
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,041
[Hoffman] And you see who signed it?

785
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:34,291
[sighs] "The Panthers."

786
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,125
You understand that to mean
the Black Panthers, don't you?

787
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:41,250
You understand defendant Bobby Seale
is the head of the Black Panthers.

788
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,250
- Judge, you can't...
- He's chairman of the Black Panther Party.

789
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:48,500
Do you still feel that you can render
a fair and impartial verdict?

790
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:51,625
[sighs]

791
00:41:57,333 --> 00:42:00,583
[Hoffman] Juror number six,
your family has been threatened

792
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,083
and so have you…

793
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,833
by members of an organization
that is led by one of the defendants.

794
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:09,750
Judge, for the love of Christ, she…

795
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:15,041
- I apologize, Your Honor.
- I would think so.

796
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,083
Do you still feel you can render
a fair and impartial verdict?

797
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,541
No, sir.

798
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,208
You're dismissed from this jury.
Thank you for your service.

799
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:29,750
Please bring in juror number eleven.

800
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,208
- I'm sorry.
- Keep reading James Baldwin.

801
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:43,000
[Foran] Bill, I thought the Panthers
were smarter than that.

802
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:44,250
- They are.
- Well...

803
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:47,208
The Panthers don't write letters
any more than the Mob does.

804
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,958
The moment I find out
that it was your office that did,

805
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:53,625
you'll see the criminal justice system
up closer than you ever wanted to.

806
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,958
- Who are the alternates?
- [Jerry] We're gonna make this public.

807
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,541
- Help yourself.
- [Tom] Who are they?

808
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:14,458
Somebody other than the FBI
has to investigate that letter.

809
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,666
Who'd you have in mind?
Jefferson Airplane?

810
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,250
- The FBI investigates.
- This is bullshit.

811
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,541
Who are the alternates?

812
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,345
- Fucking bullshit.
- Clean up the language.

813
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:25,166
Kay Richards.
42-year-old dental hygienist.

814
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,458
[Tom] That doesn't sound bad.

815
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:30,583
We think she's dating a guy named
Tom Banachek, who works for Daley.

816
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:33,125
[overlapping angry chatter]

817
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,958
- We were out of peremptory challenges.
- How did this happen?

818
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:38,916
It's either her or that Korean War vet

819
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,666
who kicked his son out of the house
for protesting the Vietnam.

820
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,625
You don't have to be Clarence Darrow…

821
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:47,666
Did they manipulate the jury pool?
How come there's nobody who looks like me?

822
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:52,083
All right, raise your hands if any of you
have ever shown up for jury duty.

823
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,875
No? Then shut the fuck up.

824
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:56,333
- Bill…
- Yeah?

825
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:57,416
[Tom] What?

826
00:43:58,666 --> 00:43:59,916
He's sequestering the jury.

827
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:01,708
Of course he is.

828
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,250
[trash can clattering]

829
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,208
No such thing as a political trial.

830
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:08,291
Good to know.

831
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,708
I…

832
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:16,833
I want an expert in geriatric psychiatry
sitting in the gallery for a few days.

833
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,625
I want a medical evaluation
of this… this judge.

834
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:28,083
[newscaster speaking on TV]

835
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,291
The sequester's probably a reaction
to Abbie doing stand-up on weekends.

836
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:33,583
It's not stand-up.

837
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:36,791
You're in a college auditorium
in a spotlight telling jokes.

838
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,500
That's a little reductive.

839
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:40,833
Names?

840
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:43,083
Yeah. From yesterday.

841
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:48,958
[John] You hungry?

842
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,291
If I hadn't asked you
to help me with Sara Beth,

843
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,000
- none of this would have happened.
- No.

844
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:58,125
I asked you to help with Sara Beth.
That got us the first riot.

845
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,708
The first riot got us the real riot.

846
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,125
- That's not...
- Hang on.

847
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:07,125
[bugle playing "Taps" on TV]

848
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,833
Anyway, I'm telling stories. I always…

849
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:23,000
I'll add the names.

850
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:24,833
Thank you.

851
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:28,708
We move to strike the order
for sequestration of the jury,

852
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,041
which was made by Your Honor,
sua sponte motion...

853
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,291
Hold on.

854
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:36,291
Mr. Rubin, Mr. Hoffman.

855
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,750
- [spectators laugh]
- What are you wearing?

856
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,875
It's an homage to you, Your Honor.

857
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,583
Do you have clothes underneath there?

858
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:46,291
Yes. Hold on.

859
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,750
- Yes.
- Take off the robes, please.

860
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,208
- [all laughing]
- [gavel banging]

861
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:56,375
[Hoffman] Silence!

862
00:45:56,458 --> 00:46:00,958
Bailiff, charge Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hoffman
with one count of contempt.

863
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:02,791
Mr. Kunstler, continue.

864
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:05,750
We feel that sequestration,

865
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:09,250
for what appears will be
a considerable period of time, can only...

866
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:13,458
It would be a considerably shorter period
if the defense made fewer objections.

867
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,291
…can only serve
to the defendants' disadvantage.

868
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:20,333
The defense will make not one
fewer objection than the prosecution

869
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:22,750
or this court gives us reason to.

870
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:28,041
Bailiff, charge Mr. Kunstler
with one count of contempt.

871
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:32,083
May I continue my argument
so it appears in the record?

872
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:33,375
You may continue.

873
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:37,083
The jury will be in the custody
of the deputy marshals.

874
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:40,458
The marshals will take care of
all the needs and wants of the jury.

875
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:44,083
We feel that that tends
to make the jurors sympathetic.

876
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:47,125
The jury are gonna be
taken care of… [fades out]

877

[people shouting faintly]

878
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,291
- Paul Deluca.
- And what is your occupation?

879
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:06,333
[Deluca] I'm a detective with
the police department, City of Chicago.

880
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:10,000
Calling your attention to
August of 1968 during the convention,

881
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,166
did you have a specific assignment?

882
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:16,708
To keep Rennie Davis under surveillance
with my partner, Detective Bell.

883
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:21,708
While you were surveilling Rennie Davis
on the evening of Sunday, August 25th,

884
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:23,750
the night before the convention began,

885
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,541
did you observe
Tom Hayden committing a crime?

886
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:30,916
Yes, Mr. Hayden was letting the air out
of the tire of a police vehicle.

887
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,291

00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:03,375
It's a strategy of throwin' banana peels
all over Chicago,

895
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:05,375
and the machine will stumble.

896
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:08,583
When it stumbles,
it goes into a policy of overkill

897
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,791
and it starts to devour itself.

898
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:13,041
We gotta convince 'em.

899
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:17,291
We gotta convince 'em of what?

903
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:27,750
We think it's important

904
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:30,750
for confrontational tactical knowledge
to be understood.

905
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:31,916
[man] You know it!

906
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,458
[Jerry] Right, confrontational tactics
make us safer.

907
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:35,375
- Yeah.
- Right.

908
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:37,583
[Jerry] Why?
Because the pigs become afraid.

909
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:41,375

You don't fight fire with fire.
You fight it with water, jackass.

- It's a metaphor.
- Abbie and his fuckin' banana peels?

913
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,625
Also a metaphor.

the state police and the Guard,

Daley's got 15,000 soldiers whose guns
are loaded with bullets that are literal.

- Yeah, so could I, but don't.

00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,208
I think those are my guys.

921
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:12,458
I think that's their car.

922
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:17,666
Yep, that's them. They're back.
They were following me all day.

923
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,750
Listen, here's the thing
I haven't told you about Sara Beth.

924
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,916
- She isn't into this at all.
- Isn't into what?

925
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,666
When I'm with her
and her family, I try to…

926
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,625

by two undercover police officers...

- That'll be hard to explain.
- This isn't her world.

931
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:42,833
It's definitely not her parents' world.

932
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:47,041
- If I bring my world into their driveway...
- You could be in a healthier relationship.

933
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:50,833
I know, but until then,
it's the one I got.

934
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:53,416
- So that's their car?
- [Rennie] Yep.

935
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,291
- [Tom] Where are they?
- Looking for me.

936
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:01,000
All right, go back into the crowd
and let 'em find you.

937
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:04,083
And then leave the park by the east exit.

938
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:06,958
- They'll need their car to follow you.
- What are you gonna do?

939
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:10,541
It won't remind anyone of Gandhi,
but a little civil disobedience. Go.

940
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:14,000
- You're not gonna cut the brakes...
- I'll let the air out of a tire. Go.

00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:17,375
[sighs] I appreciate it.
I don't wanna be a phony with Sara...

00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:20,333
- You're welcome. You should really go now.
- Yep.

Detective Bell and I spotted
Rennie Davis walking in the crowd,

944
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:28,666
and we observed him on foot
for a few minutes.

945
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,083
Then we returned to the unit.

946
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,916
- Your car?
- Yes.

947
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,083
What did you find?

948
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:35,958
[air hissing]

949
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:38,458
- [Deluca] Don't fuckin' move.
- [Bell] On your feet.

950
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:40,708
Those are two contradictory instructions...

951
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:44,041
All right, hands behind your head.

952
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,833
Spread your legs.

953
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:49,708
- Was that a contradictory instruction?
- No.

954
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:52,208
- What happened then?
- Someone from the crowd shouted…

955
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:55,958
- [woman] They're hassling Tom Hayden!
- Paulie, you need to see what I'm seeing.

956
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:02,208
- [Deluca] Hey! Stay back there! All of ya!
- [Bell] Police! Stay back!

957
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:06,000
- Listen, everybody stay cool.
- Shut up. All right, tell 'em to get back.

958
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:08,541
- Again, that's a contradict...
- Tell 'em to get back.

959
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,791
Did he tell the crowd to back down?

960
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:13,666
Everybody get back.
I'm all right. Stay cool.

961
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,083
He was egging them on.

962
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:17,541
Did you take Mr. Hayden under arrest
at that moment?

963
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,291
- No, sir.
- Why not?

964
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:23,000
- Who's shinin' that?
- Paulie, it's a camera. It's a TV camera.

965
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:25,916
We wanted to defuse the situation,

966
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,250
so we arranged
to take Mr. Hayden in the next morning.

967
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,458
This is gonna be for me.

968
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,166
Let me try to explain to them.

969
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,208
Tell 'em about Sara Beth's parents.

970
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:38,750
- Yeah.
- I was kidding.

971
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:41,208
Just bail me out
and keep to the schedule. It's fine.

972
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:42,958
- Tom Hayden?
- Yeah.

973
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,791
- See you in a bit.
- You're under arrest.

974
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:45,875
Got it.

975
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:50,333
We'll stand in recess for one hour,
and court will resume at 1:30...

976
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:53,166
Your Honor, I have a motion
I'd like to bring forward.

977
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,208
You wish to address the court, Mr. Seale?

978
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:59,833
- Yes. I have a motion...
- I will hear you, Mr. Seale.

979
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:02,875
Just a moment.

980
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,500
Mr. Seale, do you have a motion?

981
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:09,333
"I, Bobby G. Seale, have a motion
pro se to defend myself."

982
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:12,833
"I'd like to invoke the precedent
of <i>Adams v. US ex rel. McCann,</i>

983
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:14,500
where the Supreme Court is..."

984
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:17,458
That's enough.
Where are you learning these things?

985
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:20,958
Does your young friend Mr. Hampton
have a background in law?

986
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:24,541
Your Honor, the other defendants
would like to join in Mr. Seale's motion.

987
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:26,708
Are you now speaking
on behalf of Mr. Seale?

988
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:30,583
No, Your Honor, I'm speaking
on behalf of the other defendants.

989
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:33,416
You're right next to him.
Why don't you represent him?

990
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,083
Because I'm not his lawyer, sir.

991
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:39,583
And if I understand Mr. Seale,
this last month and a half,

992
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:43,833
and I believe I have,
he is not represented by counsel.

993
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:44,750
Overruled.

994
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,791
- I am being denied right now…
- Mr. Seale…

995
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:50,625
…my constitutional right
for legal representation...

996
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:52,125
Will you be quiet!

997
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,208
You have lawyers to speak for you.

998
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:58,083
[shouting] No, he doesn't!

999
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:17,625
Cite Mr. Kunstler
with his second count of contempt.

1000
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:18,875
[bailiff] All rise.

1001
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:26,041
[crowd laughing]

1002
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:30,041
[Abbie] So, Hayden's in a holding cell
on a tire pressure-related charge,

1003
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:33,208
and suddenly, every freak
in Chicago is mobilized.

1004
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:35,083
"They got Hayden!"

1005
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:38,083
"We gotta march down
to the police station,

1006
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:41,125
overcome the cops
and the Illinois National Guard

1007
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:43,000
and free Tom Hayden!"

1008
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:44,250
[crowd laughing]

1009
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:46,041
We couldn't find our way out of the park.

1010
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:48,208
[crowd laughing]

1011
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:53,333
Now, over the course of ten days,
the government called 37 witnesses,

1012
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:57,125
each and every one of them
an employee of the government.

1013
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:01,375
I call this portion of the trial
"with friends like these."

1014
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,541
Rennie, this is Sam. He can be trusted.

1015
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,708
Detective Sam McGiven,
Chicago Police Department.

1016
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,416
- Abbie, this is Stan.
- Oh, hey.

1017
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,416
- Stan Wojohowski.
- How you doin', Stan?

1018
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,708
- What is your occupation?
- I'm a Chicago police officer.

1019
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:15,000
Scotty Scibelli, Tom.

1020
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:18,041
I'm your guy for ass, weed
or whatever you need.

1021
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:21,125
Staff Sergeant Scott Scibelli,
Illinois State Police.

1022
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:25,958
- [billiard balls clacking]
- [jazz music playing]

1023
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:29,083
It's from the woman in the glasses.

1024
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,875
- Really?
- Yeah.

1025
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:46,208
Hey, uh, did you mean this for me?

1026
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:48,625
- I did.
- Nobody's ever sent me a drink before.

1027
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:51,250
- How do you like it so far?
- It's a Tom Collins.

1028
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:54,208
I know it's a country club drink,
but they're delicious.

1029
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:59,000
A man in England named Tom Collins
claimed in 1894 to have invented it,

1030
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:01,916
but then another man,
whose name I've forgotten, said no,

1031
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,708
he'd invented it two years earlier,
and I think there was a lawsuit.

1032
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:08,750
That's a surprising amount of controversy
for gin and lemonade.

1033
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:10,583
- I'm Jerry.
- I know.

1034
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:15,541
Jerry, do you know why the French
only eat one egg for breakfast?

1035
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:17,583
- No.
- Because in France,

1036
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:20,291
one egg… is <i>un oeuf.</i>

1037
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:23,666
It's <i>un oeuf.</i>

1038
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,958
- [chuckles] Wow!
- I know!

1039
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,458
I feel so much better
about my Tom Collins story.

1040
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:30,541
[chuckles]

1041
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:32,208
I'm Daphne O'Connor.

1042
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:35,958
Special Agent Daphne O'Connor,
FBI Counterintelligence.

1043
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,208
[Schultz] Spell your name.

1044
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:40,916
Think it's possible there were
seven demonstrators in Chicago last summer

1045
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,625
leading 10,000 undercover cops in protest?

1046
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,166
What was your assignment in Chicago?

1047
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:48,458
To use Jerry Rubin
to infiltrate the leaders of the protest.

1048
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:52,291
And you were with Jerry Rubin,
Abbie Hoffman, Dave Dellinger

1049
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:55,458
and Rennie Davis
on the afternoon of the 27th?

1050
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:56,375
Yes.

1051
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:59,791
- What were they doing together?
- They were leading a group of protesters.

1052
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:01,833
- How many, would you say?
- About 800.

1053
00:56:01,916 --> 00:56:03,708
Where were they leading these 800 people?

1054
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:06,708
- To police headquarters at 11th and State.
- Why?

1055
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:10,708
Tom Hayden was being held there on charges
of tampering with a police vehicle.

1056
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:13,458
Jerry Rubin said
it was time to "confront the pigs."

1057
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:16,041
And by "pigs," he meant…

1058
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:18,333
It was time to confront the police.

1059
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,208
[indistinct radio chatter]

1060
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:22,958
[man] Follow Abbie!

1061
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,500
[David] Marshals, we're on the move.

1062
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:33,125
I remember also at the front of the group
was Mr. Allen Ginsberg.

1063
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:34,833
Allen Ginsberg, the poet?

1064
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:37,708
Yes, he was chanting a kind of war chant.

1065
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:41,000
- [Ginsberg chanting] Om.
- [Jerry] What's he doing?

1066
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,166
He's channeling the energy.
Settling things down.

1067
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,625
And how's that workin' so far?

1068
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:47,625
- [woman] Our streets!
- [all] Our streets!

1069
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:51,666
- [woman] Our streets!
- [all] Our streets!

1070
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:56,500
The guy testified that Ginsberg
was letting out a war chant,

1071
00:56:56,583 --> 00:57:00,458
some kinda fucking jungle signal
to Beat poets,

1072
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:04,291
that they should begin
pelting the troops with blank verse.

1073
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,333
[crowd laughs]

1074
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:09,875
So, a guy in the crowd is marching
with a girl on his shoulders.

1075
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:12,416
She's waving an American flag,

1076
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,125
and this seems to really
be bothering some frat brothers

1077
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:18,916
who'd come to town
in the spirit of fraternity.

1078
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,333
- [frat boy 1] Put down the flag!
- [frat boy 2] Hey, put the flag down!

1079
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:25,416
Can you hear us?
Are you fucking deaf, you bitch?

1080
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,583
- Put the flag down!
- Go to the kitchen and make me a sandwich!

1081
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,875
I'm gonna go back there
and take care of that.

1082
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:33,250
They are not the enemy.

1083
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:35,083
In so many fuckin' ways, they are.

1084
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:42,000
[all chanting] Free Tom Hayden!
Free Tom Hayden!

1085
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,916
The group turned left on 11th Street.

1086
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,916
We make a left on 11th Street.

1087
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,083
That's when they saw it.

1088
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:55,708
[all chanting] Free Tom Hayden!

1089
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:58,583
[all chanting] Free Tom Hayden!

1090
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:00,958
[all chanting] Free Tom Hayden!

1091
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:02,500
Holy shit! [chuckles]

1092
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:04,500
[protesters continue chanting]

1093
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:06,875
[protesters continue chanting]

1094
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:08,666
Are they about to conquer Spain?

1095
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,750
[chanting continues]

1096
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,625
[protesters] Free Tom Hayden!

1097
00:58:13,708 --> 00:58:14,708
Fuck it.

1098
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,333
- What do you mean, "Fuck it"?
- This is it. It's time.

1099
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,875
- We're not rushing the police.
- Why the fuck not?

1100
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:25,125
- We'll be critically injured.
- Tom doesn't want anyone hurt.

1101
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:27,375
Turn this crowd around.
There's too much momentum.

1102
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:30,166
- Turn 'em around and calm them down.
- What are we doin'?

1103
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,416
He's right. This is not safe.
I know something about this. Come on.

1104
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,458
Marshals, turn 'em around
and slow 'em down.

1105
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:38,000
Looks like the Alamo back here.
Turn 'em around.

1106
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,875
- Bring 'em safely to the park.
- We should be marching up to them.

1107
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:43,000
I don't think they'll surrender, man.

1108
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,291
Keep 'em movin'. Dave and I
are gonna stay and make Tom's bail.

1109
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,583
Back to the park!

1110
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,541
I don't carry money, do you?

1111
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:54,500
I do. I'm a grown man.

1112
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:55,916
[Ginsberg chanting] Om.

1113
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,416
You're killin' me, Allen.
You're goddamn killing me!

1114
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,000
The marshals are spreading word
that we gotta keep moving.

1115
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,625
"Go left on Roosevelt
and back in the park," right?

1116
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,000
When they got to the park,

1117
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,000
three divisions of police officers
had moved in from the south.

1118
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:11,125
[police siren wails]

1119
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:21,125
[indistinct shouting]

1120
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:31,041
I don't know
what tactical genius came up with that,

1121
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,791
but you know when shit happens?

1122
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:36,000
When you don't give protesters
a place to go.

1123
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:38,375
How would you characterize
the mood of the crowd?

1124
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:42,750
The witness is in no position to
characterize the mood of 1,000 strangers.

1125
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,208
Do you have an objection?

1126
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:46,166
- Yes, sir.
- On what grounds?

1127
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,250
On those grounds.

1128
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:49,250
[spectators] Overruled.

1129
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:51,291
I will clear this courtroom.

1130
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:53,833
Mr. Wojohowski?

1131
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:55,333
The crowd was looking for a fight.

1132
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:58,500
You're pigs! Your children are pigs!

1133
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,791
No, we should leave
their children out of it.

1134
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,291
You're right. I know.

1135
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:04,916
"White honky MFers, get out of our park."

1136
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,375
And then he said, "Look at 'em."

1137
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:07,875
They don't look so tough.

1138
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:10,458
Well, the guns…

1139
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:12,791
There are no permits
for this demonstration.

1140
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,833
You're ordered
to leave the park, immediately!

1141
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:17,333
Put down your guns, motherfuckers!

1142
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:18,958
Fight like fuckin' men!

1143
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:21,625
Just so you know,
I do not have your back on that.

1144
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:26,250
And the guys from Kappa Gamma Douchebag,
who were hassling the girl?

1145
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,041
- [crowd chuckles]
- They're back.

1146
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,916
Put down the goddamn flag, you cunt!

1147
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,916
- Go make me a sandwich!
- Put it down!

1148
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,875
- Put the flag down!
- [Daphne] Calm down!

1149
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:37,416
- [overlapping shouts]
- Help me calm 'em down, Jerry!

1150
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,250
Baby, defuse the situation.
They will listen to you.

1151
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:42,000
- Huh.
- What?

1152
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:44,333
Nothing, that sounded nice
when you said it.

1153
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:45,583
- Right now!
- Yeah.

1154
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:48,916
- Someone from the crowd shouts…
- A guy in the crowd shouts…

1155
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,875
Someone in the crowd shouted…

1156
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:52,125
Take the hill!

1157
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:56,291
Hey! Stop running! Hey, everybody!

1158
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:59,625
The street name
for chloroacetophenone is tear gas.

1159
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:00,708
Fire!

1160
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:04,208
[Abbie] And it's a fuckin' blowtorch.

1161
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:06,708
Your lungs, your skin, your eyes…

1162
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:08,333
- [man] Go, go!
- Riot clubs?

1163
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:11,208
They're made out of the same wood
they use for baseball bats.

1164
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:13,166
[overlapping clamor]

1165
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:33,208
[woman screams] Let me go!

1166
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:42,166
[coughing]

1167
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,666
- Put the flag down!
- [screaming]

1168
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,875
- Hey!
- [frat boy] You shut your fuckin' mouth!

1169
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,625
- What are you doing?
- [woman screaming]

1170
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,250
[frat boy] You got this coming!

1171
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:57,875
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Hey! Hey, get the fuck off of her!

1172
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,250
What's the matter with you?

1173
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:00,541
Fuck you, hippie faggot!

1174
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,541
[grunting]

1175
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:04,583
You're all right.

1176
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:06,625
- You're okay. Here.
- [coughing]

1177
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:09,750
You gotta just hold this
over your face, okay?

1178
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:12,041
I'm gonna take you
to the first-aid station.

1179
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:13,583
You're all right. I got you.

1180
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:16,166
We have to go. Okay,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1181
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,500
- [gun cocks]
- I'm gonna…

1182
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,625
[officer] Don't move, Jerry.

1183
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:24,416
- Man, get those guys. They were...
- You're under arrest.

1184
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:29,541
[man over PA] <i>Everybody gather
in the center of the park…</i>

1185
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,958
After bailing out Tom Hayden,

1186
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:36,375
Abbie, Dave and Tom returned to the park.
Is that correct?

1187
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,916
[ambulance siren wailing]

1188
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,583
[man] Sir, can you look at me? Sir?

1189
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:45,875
[grunts]

1190
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,500
[officer] Get in.

1191
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,041
I'll be honest.

1192
01:02:57,125 --> 01:03:00,000
I was starting to worry about
getting everyone out of Chicago alive.

1193
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:02,500
- That's not really up to us.
- Yeah, it is.

1194
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,708
What are you lookin' at me for?
I went to bail you out.

1195
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:08,458
800 people followed you?

1196
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:12,458
Oh, that. Yeah, people follow me.
Hell if I know why.

1197
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,250
I'm racking my brain as well.

1198
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,000
How'd you make bail so fast?

1199
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,541
I wasn't arrested, I was detained.

1200
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:21,000
They couldn't figure out
what to charge me with.

1201
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:22,083
Assault.

1202
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:26,291
I was assaulting someone
who was assaulting someone.

1203
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:27,517
- So...
- [Daphne] Okay, guys.

1204
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:30,416
Nothing is more dangerous
than a crowd of people moving.

1205
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,041
It's like trying to redirect
the Mississippi River.

1206
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:36,291
- Isn't she great?
- Get your people to cool off.

1207
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:38,875
- We're responsible for these people.
- Tommy.

1208
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:41,125
We have to protest
in front of the convention.

1209
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:44,458
Plain and simple.
'Cause that's where the cameras are.

1210
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:48,125
We have to get to the convention.
That means we have to leave the park.

1211
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,958
And that's when people'll get hurt.

1212
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:54,041
As long as every person following me
knows that, then I sleep fine at night.

1213
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:55,666
Tell me how you do it.

1214
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,541
- A lot of it is drugs.
- Yeah?

1215
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,666
This is what happened
when we try to go up a hill.

1216
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:04,458
We're not getting
anywhere near the convention.

1217
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:10,875
Special Agent O'Connor,
you testified that Jerry Rubin said,

1218
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:15,541
"Fuck 'em all. They're all pigs.
We should form an army and get guns."

1219
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,000
Yes.

1220
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:20,041
And when he said that,
did anyone form an army and get guns?

1221
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:20,958
No.

1222
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:24,625
[Bill] Did Jerry Rubin instruct
the crowd to run into the park?

1223
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,000
- No.
- Did Rennie Davis?

1224
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:29,791
- No.
- Was Abbie Hoffman even there?

1225
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:31,750
- No.
- Was Dave Dellinger?

1226
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:33,833
- No.
- John Froines there?

1227
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,291
- No.
- Lee Weiner?

1228
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,250
No, he wasn't there.

1229
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:39,875
You testified that Jerry and Rennie…

1230
01:04:39,958 --> 01:04:41,708
Can you say it for me again?

1231
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:44,416
That they were trying
to turn the people around

1232
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,875
and send them back down the hill
just like you told them to.

1233
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:50,000
Is that correct?

1234
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:57,500
Mr. Kunstler,
the demonstrators attacked the police

1235
01:04:57,583 --> 01:04:58,916
and the police responded.

1236
01:05:00,416 --> 01:05:04,500
And are any of those demonstrators
that you saw attacking the police

1237
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,875
sitting here at the defense table?

1238
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:09,583
- No, sir.
- Well, thank you.

1239
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:12,000
No further questions.

1240
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:14,083
- The court will stand...
- I wasn't there, either.

1241
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:15,958
- Mr. Seale...
- I wasn't there at all.

1242
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,333
I should be allowed
to cross-examine this witness!

1243
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:21,000
- We will stand in recess until...
- Four hours!

1244
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,083
[Hoffman] Mr. Hampton!

1245
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:24,041
That's how long Bobby Seale
was in Chicago.

1246
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,708
- [Hoffman] Quiet!
- Four hours!

1247
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:28,916
- [spectators clapping]
- [gavel banging]

1248
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,625
[gavel banging continues]

1249
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:34,375
[bailiff] All rise.

1250
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:42,250
[Hoffman] The court will stand in recess
for the weekend.

1251
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:49,291
[brass quartet playing Christmas carols]

1252
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:51,083
[Jerry] Yeah, I took in the exhibit.

1253
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:53,000
I cleared my mind.

1254
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:57,125
Stood there for 20 minutes.
I felt nothing.

1255
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:03,458
Well, but it wasn't a painting,
it was an exhibit.

1256
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:05,625
It was a natural history museum.

1257
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:08,625
And when you put exhibits
of Native Indian families

1258
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:10,250
in a natural history museum

1259
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:13,500
alongside dioramas of early man
and the Jurassic age,

1260
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:18,333
it gives the impression that the Cherokee
evolved into modern-day Europeans.

1261
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:20,541
[Abbie] Look who it is.

1262
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:23,083
I got a bone to pick with that guy.

1263
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:24,333
Hey, Counselor.

1264
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,958
- No colleges this weekend?
- [Abbie] Winter break.

1265
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:30,708
- My audience went home to their parents.
- [Schultz] Mm-hmm.

1266
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:32,333
Are these ladies related to you?

1267
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:34,791
These are my daughters.
This is Emily and Julie.

1268
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,208
[Abbie] Your dad's a good guy.

1269
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:39,250
That's coming from someone
who he's trying hard to put in prison.

1270
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:41,291
We shouldn't be talking
without your lawyer.

1271
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:42,625
We're all on the same team.

1272
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,666
In a sense, I guess,
but in a much truer sense, we're not.

1273
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,166
Girls, here, take this dollar

1274
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,916
and go over to those musicians
and put it in their hat, okay?

1275
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,958
And here's a quarter.
Go buy some of those candy-coated peanuts

1276
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:59,041
that your mom won't let you have.
All right? Shh.

1277
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,875
- [Abbie] Sweet kids.
- Thank you.

1278
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:06,541
If your lawyer <i>were</i> here, I'd tell you
the window's closing for you to plead out.

1279
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:09,458
We're not taking a fuckin' deal.
Would you stop?

1280
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:13,000
I wish I could share Abbie's sentiment
that you're a good guy,

1281
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,250
but I'm afraid I can't.

1282
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:16,333
I'm sorry to hear that.

1283
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:20,333
Sending Daphne O'Connor
to break my heart was way out of line.

1284
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:22,708
Well, I don't work for the FBI,

1285
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:25,833
but O'Connor was one of many agents
sent to gather intelligence

1286
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,875
on what had been deemed a credible threat.

1287
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:32,000
Fine. Then you bug our phones,
you wire up a dope dealer. Be a man.

1288
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:35,958
- You don't send a woman to ensorcell me.
- What?

1289
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,750
- It means to enchant.
- Oh.

1290
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:41,583
- Only to have her crush my soul.
- How long did you two know each other?

1291
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:45,375
Ninety-three hours.
Could've been a lifetime.

1292
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:47,583
For a fruit fly. Enjoy your weekend.

1293
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:49,375
[Jerry] Is that even ethical?

1294
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,583
Aren't there ethics rules?

1295
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:53,208
Did she engage with you sexually?

1296
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,750
Well, we were takin' it slow.

1297
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,333
He's gonna be all right.

1298
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:00,666
One egg is <i>un oeuf?</i>

1299
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:04,250
- They teach her that at the Academy?
- Yep.

1300
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,166
We don't have any beef with you.

1301
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:09,208
We know you're doing your job
and you don't think we're criminals.

1302
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:11,000
I'm not sure where you get that info,

1303
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,791
but I represent the People
without passion or prejudice.

1304
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:16,250
You think we were responsible?

1305
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:18,625
You got the result you were looking for.

1306
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:22,500
- So did Nixon.
- How 'bout that?

1307
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:24,541
See you Monday.

1308
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:27,666
Does she ever mention me?

1309
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:40,166
[telephone ringing]

1310
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,208
Conspiracy Office.

1311
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:00,541
I need a second.

1312
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:08,666
Something's happened, Tom.

1313
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,666
[door buzzes and unlocks]

1314
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:19,500
[door slams]

1315
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,291
[Bill] Bobby, uh…

1316
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:35,666
Fred Hampton
was shot and killed last night.

1317
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:43,250
There was a police raid,
and there was a shootout.

1318
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:45,166
And he's dead.

1319
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:51,083
- It took place between the hours of 4:00...
- I know.

1320
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:54,708
- You were told?
- Yeah.

1321
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:55,875
Um…

1322
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,541
I'm so sorry.

1323
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:09,333
The seven of you,
you've all got the same father, right?

1324
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:12,958
I'm talkin' to you.

1325
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:17,416
You all got the same father, right?

1326
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,083
"Cut your hair…

1327
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:25,333
don't be a fag, respect authority,
respect America, respect me."

1328
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:31,000
Your life, it's a "fuck you"
to your father, right?

1329
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,166
A little?

1330
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:38,375
- [softly] Maybe.
- [Bobby] Maybe.

1331
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:41,833
And you can see how that's different
from a rope on a tree?

1332
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:43,916
Yeah.

1333
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:45,458
Yeah.

1334
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,916
He was shot in the shoulder first.

1335
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:55,166
You can't aim a gun
if you've been shot in the shoulder.

1336
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,791
You can't squeeze the trigger.

1337
01:10:58,041 --> 01:10:59,833
Second shot was in his head.

1338
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:03,958
Fred was executed.

1339
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:09,666
Anything else?

1340
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:14,916
No.

1341
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,708
[door buzzes and opens]

1342
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:27,541
[door slams]

1343
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:31,375
[Schultz distorted] Calling your attention
to the evening of the next day,

1344
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:34,875
Tuesday, August 27th,
were you in Grant Park?

1345
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:38,750
[detective distorted] Yes. There was
a "Free Huey Newton" rally going on.

1346
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:42,625
- [Schultz] Recognize any of the speakers?
- I heard Jerry Rubin give a speech.

1347
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,208
Phil Ochs sang,
and then Bobby Seale gave a speech.

1348
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:48,958
I object to this testimony against me
because I have been denied counsel.

1349
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,083
We understand.

1350
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:54,250
Do you recall any of Mr. Seale's speech?

1351
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:55,416
[detective] Yes. He said...

1352
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,458
- I object to this man's...
- Quiet!

1353
01:11:58,375 --> 01:11:59,208
[Schultz] Go ahead.

1354
01:11:59,291 --> 01:12:01,833
- [detective] May I refer to notes?
- [Schultz] Yes.

1355
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:07,125
[clears throat] He said, "We must
understand that as we go forth

1356
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:09,166
to try to move
the reprobate politicians…"

1357
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,083
Your Honor...

1358
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:14,000
"…our cowardly Congress,
the jive, double-lip talking Nixon..."

1359
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:16,333
"Jive, double-lip, talking Nixon…"

1360
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:20,000
You're making me sound like
one funky cat. Thank you, sir.

1361
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:22,208
Last warning, Mr. Seale.

1362
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,791
Did he say anything else?

1363
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:28,166
He said, "The revolution at this time

1364
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:32,333
is directly connected
to organized guns in force."

1365
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:35,541
No more questions.

1366
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:41,166
Jive, double-lip talking.
Funky, funky cat.

1367
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,791
Would the defense like
to cross-examine the witness?

1368
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:48,166
Yes. I'm sittin' here saying that I would
like to cross-examine a witness.

1369
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,166
- Only lawyers can address a witness.
- My lawyer is Charles Garry.

1370
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,750
- I'm tired of hearing that.
- Couldn't care less what you're tired of.

1371
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:56,541
What did you say?

1372
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:04,125
I said it would be impossible for me
to care any less what you are tired of.

1373
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:07,208
And I demand to cross-examine the witness.

1374
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:09,416
[Hoffman] Sit in your chair and be quiet.

1375
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:13,125
And don't ever address this court
in that manner again.

1376
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,666
Are there any further questions?

1377
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,958
We'll stand in recess for one hour,
and court will resume again...

1378
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:27,166
- It was premeditated murder!
- [man] Yes, it was!

1379
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:31,000
- Fred Hampton was assassinated last night!
- [Hoffman] Marshals, put Mr. Seale...

1380
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:33,041
He wouldn't have been able to hold a gun!

1381
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:37,875
When they publish the coroner's report,
ask about the bullet in his shoulder!

1382
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,375
I strongly caution you, Mr. Seale.

1383
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,958
I strongly caution...

1384
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:49,625
- Oh, strongly fuck yourself!
- [spectators gasp]

1385
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:55,041
Marshals, take that defendant into a room

1386
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:57,708
and deal with him
as he should be dealt with.

1387
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:00,958
[spectators murmuring]

1388
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:06,083
[muffled grunts, gasps]

1389
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:58,333
[door opens]

1390
01:14:58,416 --> 01:14:59,875
[spectators gasping]

1391
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,125
[gavel banging]

1392
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:29,333
Let the record show
that I tried, fairly and impartially.

1393
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:33,416
I tried to get the defendant
to sit on his own.

1394
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,708
I ask you again, Mr. Seale,

1395
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:39,250
and you may indicate
by raising your head up and down,

1396
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:42,083
or moving it from side to side,

1397
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:47,541
if I have your assurance that you will
not do anything to disrupt this trial,

1398
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:50,666
if I allow you to resume proper order.

1399
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:54,041
Do I have your assurance?

1400
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:05,125
Mr. Schultz, call your next witness.

1401
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,958
Mr. Schultz?

1402
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:21,250
Your Honor, may we approach?

1403
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,500
[Bill] Can he breathe?

1404
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:31,208
Can you breathe all right, Bobby?

1405
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:41,166
Your Honor, our defendant is gagged
and bound in an American courtroom.

1406
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,125
He brought it on himself.

1407
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:44,208
Are you insane?

1408
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,375
Mr. Kunstler.

1409
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:48,500
Love of God.

1410
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:52,208
What do you want, Mr. Schultz?
This is your sidebar.

1411
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:55,875
The government would like to make a motion
that Bobby Seale be separated...

1412
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:57,958
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Sir, please.

1413
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:01,541
A motion that Bobby Seale be separated
from the rest of the defendants

1414
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:03,750
and his case be declared a mistrial.

1415
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,208
You want me to give him his mistrial?

1416
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:10,875
Of course, because you took that Black guy
and you made him a sympathetic character.

1417
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:15,625
Mr. Kunstler, I have lived
a very long time, sir.

1418
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:18,833
And you're the first person ever

1419
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:23,208
to suggest that I have discriminated
against a Black man.

1420
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:25,208
Then let the record show
that I am the second.

1421
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:29,416
Step back.

1422
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:48,125
I'm issuing an order declaring a mistrial
as to the defendant Bobby G. Seale.

1423
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:51,500
- [gavel bangs]
- [all cheering and clapping]

1424
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,083
[gavel banging]

1425
01:17:57,833 --> 01:18:02,708
Mr. Seale, you are currently charged
with 16 counts of contempt

1426
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:05,791
for your repeated displays of disrespect,

1427
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:09,708
and you have a pending homicide charge
in Connecticut.

1428
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:15,166
You are not home free, sir,
and I doubt you ever will be.

1429
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:20,666
- We are adjourned until 10:00, Monday.
- [gavel bangs]

1430
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:21,916
[bailiff] All rise.

1431
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:45,625
[door opens]

1432
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,666
[door closes]

1433
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,458
[telephone rings]

1434
01:18:55,416 --> 01:18:57,500
Conspiracy Office, how can I help you?

1435
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:05,458
No, sir. I am a white woman.

1436
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:12,875
Yeah, I've slept with several
in my life so far, and on balance,

1437
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:14,500
I'd have to say it is better.

1438
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,958
I think that's a big part
of what's got you worked up.

1439
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:17,875
Hang up the phone.

1440
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:20,625
It's not so much that it's bigger.
It's just better.

1441
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:21,708
Hang up the phone.

1442
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:26,041
Was that a parting gift for Bobby?

1443
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,625
No. That was just for me.

1444
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:45,250
Why the fuck did you stand up?

1445
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,875
It was a reflex.

1446
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,750
He was respecting the institution.

1447
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:52,916
I don't know what good it does to insult
the judge in view of the jury, the press,

1448
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,375
and Foran and Schultz, who'll recommend
sentencing if we're convicted.

1449
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,791
It's a revolution, Tom.
We may have to hurt somebody's feelings.

1450
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,541
So, um…

1451
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,416
we have this list.

1452
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,958
Maybe Monday morning,
we could read the names into the record

1453
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:11,166
as a way of saying...

1454
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,083
Saying what?

1455
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:16,458
That whatever we're facing, you know,
it's peanuts compared to what...

1456
01:20:16,541 --> 01:20:19,750
He's gonna sentence us.
The judge decides what we're facing.

1457
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:22,666
- It is a goddamn trial.
- Political trial.

1458
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:26,125
No, we were arrested… The law
doesn't recognize political trials.

1459
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:29,083
No, we weren't arrested.
We were chosen.

1460
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:35,583
Lee, John, have you guys asked yourselves
what you're doing here?

1461
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:36,500
Every day.

1462
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,083
[Abbie] You're a give-back.

1463
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,708
They give the jury
a couple of guys they can acquit

1464
01:20:40,791 --> 01:20:43,583
so they feel better
about finding the rest of us guilty.

1465
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:48,375
Lenny, am I wrong?

1466
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,583
No.

1467
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:54,666
Wait, so our role in history is that
we made it easier to convict our friends?

1468
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,541
They're gonna find us guilty
if they just don't like you.

1469
01:20:57,625 --> 01:21:00,000
That's why Bill won't put us on the stand.

1470
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:02,666
I can take the stand.
I'm easier for them to like.

1471
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,625
I'm literally a Boy Scout troop leader.

1472
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:07,791
[laughing]

1473
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:13,291
You're a conscientious objector.

1474
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:15,250
A lot of people
are conscientious objectors.

1475
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:16,500
During World War II?

1476
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:20,125
You sat out World War II.
Even I wanna punch you.

1477
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,458
- We can talk about that.
- [Bill] I'm looking forward to it.

1478
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:25,208
[Jerry] I could take the stand.

1479
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:27,916
Mr. Rubin, you ever taught a classroom
how to make a bomb?

1480
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,916
Man, eighth graders are taught
how Oppenheimer made a bomb.

1481
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,125
Not one you can build
with materials from Woolworth's.

1482
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,625
You know what'd be ironic?

1483
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:38,416
- What?
- [Rennie] I said, know what...

1484
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,750
He heard you.
He's asking what would be ironic.

1485
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:45,541
I was gonna say if John Mitchell did
all this just to get back at Ramsey Clark.

1486
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,585
- [Tom] For what?
- [Rennie] That thing, remember?

1487
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:50,375
Outgoing cabinet members
are supposed to resign,

1488
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:53,250
but Ramsey Clark didn't tender
his resignation till...

1489
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,375
[Jerry] I read Mitchell
had a fit about that.

1490
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:58,416
- [Rennie] Yeah.
- [Jerry] Did you read about that, Lenny?

1491
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Bill?

1492
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,083
He was never even on our witness list.

1493
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,166
Who?

1494
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:08,833
- The first witness you put on the stand...
- If this was a political trial…

1495
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:11,416
- Bernadine.
- Yeah.

1496
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,791
I need my office to find Ramsey Clark.

1497
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:17,291
And William Kunstler just showed up.

1498
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:33,416
[Bill] Len.

1499
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:41,416
Maybe… I don't know,
does he have a Secret Service detail?

1500
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,541
Nah, they're here for us.

1501
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:52,458
He was the attorney general.
What do we do?

1502
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:55,416
- We just ring the doorbell?
- [Leonard] Yeah, I guess so.

1503
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:59,250
- You wanna do it?
- Just ring the damn…

1504
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,708
[doorbell rings]

1505
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:03,041
[door opens]

1506
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:08,125
Good morning, I'm Bill Kunstler.
Mr. Clark is expecting us.

1507
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:09,208
[woman] Come in.

1508
01:23:14,041 --> 01:23:15,041
[Tom] Good morning.

1509
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,166
He's in his study at the end of the hall.

1510
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,000
Can I get anyone coffee?

1511
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,375
I tell you what, ma'am.
That sounds great.

1512
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:27,791
Nothing for me. Thank you.

1513
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:30,208
[woman] At the end of the hall.

1514
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:32,375
Mr. Hayden?

1515
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:36,750
I read in the paper you were
the only one who stood for the judge

1516
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,416
after what he did to Bobby.

1517
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:43,500
Uh, that was a mistake.
It was just a reflex.

1518
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:44,583
[Bill] Tom?

1519
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:56,750
[Clark] Hey, Bill.

1520
01:23:58,416 --> 01:23:59,583
Ramsey Clark.

1521
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:01,791
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1522
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:05,250
This is Leonard Weinglass.

1523
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,583
- Mr. Weinglass.
- [Bill] And Tom Hayden.

1524
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:09,208
Oh, I know who Tom Hayden is.

1525
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:11,541
The FBI used to work for me.

1526
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:16,333
Those two men, they're senior deputies
with the Justice Department.

1527
01:24:16,416 --> 01:24:17,750
Mr. Kelly and Mr. Ackerman.

1528
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:22,083
- I don't know why these men are here.
- I invited them.

1529
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:23,541
You invited them?

1530
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,166
I don't want
the appearance of impropriety.

1531
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,750
There isn't any impropriety.

1532
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:30,041
And now there are witnesses to that.

1533
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:34,875
Sir, these men are gonna call
Schultz and Foran as soon as we're done.

1534
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:38,250
Don't be ridiculous.
They already called Schultz and Foran.

1535
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:41,500
And they're gonna call John Mitchell
as soon as we're done here.

1536
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:43,791
Go ahead, ask what you wanna ask.

1537
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:47,416
- In front of them?
- Yeah.

1538
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,250
All right.

1539
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:57,375
Mr. Clark, while you were
attorney general for President Johnson

1540
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:59,625
was there ever any discussion
with the White House

1541
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:01,875
about seeking indictments
against my clients?

1542
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,791
- He can't answer that.
- Why not?

1543
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:04,875
It's against the law.

1544
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:08,041
That's an overly broad
interpretation of the law.

1545
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:10,000
- If you'd like...
- [Bill] I'll tell you what.

1546
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:12,291
We've dealt with
jury tampering, wiretapping,

1547
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,541
a defendant that was literally gagged,

1548
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:17,291
and a judge who's been
handing down rulings from the bench

1549
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:19,625
that would be
considered wrong in Honduras.

1550
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:23,916
So I'm a little less interested in the law
than I was when this trial began.

1551
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,375
Well, whether you like the law or not,
as former AG, he is protected by it.

1552
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:31,166
No, you are protected by it.

1553
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:34,833
And with respect, sir, I can subpoena you.

1554
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:37,750
Find a judge in this circuit
who will sign that subpoena.

1555
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:41,583
He's right. And taking the stand
voluntarily would be a big risk for me.

1556
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:43,916
Well, again, with due respect, sir,

1557
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,375
my clients take
a much bigger risk when they…

1558
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:51,000
- stand against an enormous power…
- [Clark] What took you so long?

1559
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:53,708
…that they can't even see, and that…

1560
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:57,083
I'm sorry.
What took me so long to do what?

1561
01:25:57,166 --> 01:25:59,125
To realize I'm your star witness.

1562
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:04,708
- We were remarking upon that ourselves...
- Bill…

1563
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:06,000
He can't testify.

1564
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:08,458
I'm in private practice now.

1565
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:11,208
And if John Mitchell
wants to cut me in half,

1566
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:12,916
he can and he will.

1567
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,500
You have to find some…

1568
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:17,916
Sir, you have to find some courage now…

1569
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:21,958
- And...
- Find some courage? Yeah.

1570
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:24,708
Yes. You have to find some courage and...

1571
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:25,791
Tom.

1572
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:32,041
That's what those two men came to tell me,

1573
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:36,083
that if John Mitchell wants to
cut me in half, he can and he will.

1574
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:40,833
So I wanted them in the room when I said,

1575
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:43,041
"When do you want me in court?"

1576
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:46,958
Mr. Clark?

1577
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:48,583
I'm sorry?

1578
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:50,458
Swear me in, Bill.

1579
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:55,000
It is against the law for you to testify,
Ramsey. It is as simple as that.

1580
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:57,083
It's General Clark.

1581
01:26:57,791 --> 01:26:59,958
And arrest me or shut the fuck up.

1582
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:06,375
Found some.

1583
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:11,041
Your Honor, the People move
to disallow this witness.

1584
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:14,083
I'm sure the defense anticipated that.

1585
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:16,125
[Schultz] Code of
federal regulations mandates

1586
01:27:16,208 --> 01:27:18,500
the disclosure
of Justice Department materials

1587
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:21,625
is prohibited without prior knowledge
of the attorney general,

1588
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:24,666
plainly meaning
the <i>sitting</i> attorney general,

1589
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:27,583
who is John Mitchell,
who has denied his approval.

1590
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:32,541
Judge, the rule refers only to
very specific documents and information.

1591
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:36,333
If the regulation were interpreted
as Mr. Schultz is asking it to be,

1592
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:38,250
nobody in the federal government

1593
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:41,750
could ever testify in any trial
after they left their job.

1594
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:46,583
I think the government
is at least justified

1595
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:50,166
in asking the defense
to demonstrate, by voir dire,

1596
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:53,083
the testimony it expects
to elicit from the witness.

1597
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:56,916
You'd like us to question the witness,
this witness,

1598
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,833
outside the presence of the jury?

1599
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:04,416
If I find any of the testimony relevant,
I'll call the jury back in to hear it.

1600
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:07,083
Take it or leave it, Mr. Kunstler.

1601
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:12,750
Defense calls Ramsey Clark.

1602
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:26,916
State your name.

1603
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:30,625
- [Clark] William Ramsey Clark.
- Do you swear the testimony you give

1604
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:33,250
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1605
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:34,333
[Clark] I do.

1606
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:42,708
Mr. Clark, what was your occupation
in the summer of 1968?

1607
01:28:42,791 --> 01:28:45,166
I was the attorney general
of the United States.

1608
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:47,791
- You were appointed by President Johnson?
- Yes.

1609
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:51,208
- Confirmed by the United States Senate.
- Yes.

1610
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:56,541
Now, did you receive a phone call
at your office at 11:50 a.m.,

1611
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:59,041
on September 10th of last year?

1612
01:28:59,125 --> 01:28:59,958
Yes.

1613
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:02,208
- And from whom was that call?
- President Johnson.

1614
01:29:02,291 --> 01:29:07,750
Will you state what President Johnson
said to you and what was said to him?

1615
01:29:07,833 --> 01:29:10,125
Your Honor, at this point, we will object.

1616
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:13,875
A cabinet officer does not have to,
and should not have to relate the contents

1617
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:17,250
of a private call he had
with the president.

1618
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:19,000
I'll sustain the objection.

1619
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:22,458
Please, the court… This is voir dire.

1620
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:25,166
I thought objections were reserved.

1621
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:28,291
There's a question of
attorney-client privilege to consider.

1622
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:31,208
[Clark] The president isn't a client
of the attorney general.

1623
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:36,125
Excuse me, sir?

1624
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:39,750
The president isn't a client
of the attorney general.

1625
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:40,833
I'm happy to answer.

1626
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:42,375
[Schultz] Your Honor…

1627
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:47,833
Hearing from the witness
on this point is highly irregular.

1628
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:51,833
Well, gentlemen, um…

1629
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:55,083
This is my courtroom.

1630
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:59,500
But the witness is the former, uh…

1631
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:03,166
He's just stated
his willingness, you know,

1632
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:07,291
so, for the purposes of voir dire,
I'll hear the answer.

1633
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:09,333
Thank you.

1634
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:15,541
Mr. Clark, uh, did President Johnson
ask you a question in that phone call?

1635
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:20,000
The president asked me
if I intended to seek any indictments

1636
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:23,500
related to the riots
the previous month in Chicago.

1637
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:25,916
And what did you tell him?

1638
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,583
I told him we wouldn't be
seeking indictments.

1639
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:30,208
And can you tell us why?

1640
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:34,708
An investigation by our criminal division
led to the conclusion

1641
01:30:34,791 --> 01:30:37,500
that the riots were started
by the Chicago Police Department.

1642
01:30:37,583 --> 01:30:39,708
[all cheering and clapping]

1643
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:43,833
[gavel banging]

1644
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:56,333
And, Mr. Clark,
did your counterintelligence division

1645
01:30:56,416 --> 01:30:58,000
make a report as well?

1646
01:30:58,083 --> 01:31:01,958
They concluded that there was
no conspiracy by the defendants

1647
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,958
to incite violence during the convention.

1648
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:07,250
And then what happened
on the first Tuesday,

1649
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:09,875
after the first Monday,
in November of that year?

1650
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:12,375
- Richard Nixon was elected president.
- Sustained.

1651
01:31:12,458 --> 01:31:14,333
- Nobody objected...
- [Schultz] We do.

1652
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:17,000
It's well-known there's no love lost
between the witness

1653
01:31:17,083 --> 01:31:18,625
and the sitting attorney general.

1654
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:21,083
This witness was called to wage
a political attack

1655
01:31:21,166 --> 01:31:23,250
and should not be allowed before the jury.

1656
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,166
Mr. Kunstler.

1657
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,541
Your Honor, you cannot
possibly be considering

1658
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:29,916
not allowing the jury to hear
what we've just heard?

1659
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,041
The witness can't present them testimony

1660
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:34,916
that would assist in making
a determination of guilt or innocence.

1661
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,500
He just testified his own Justice
Department came to the conclusion...

1662
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:40,166
The <i>current</i> Justice Department,

1663
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,291
the one that matters,
came to a new conclusion.

1664
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:46,166
Therefore, motivation of the prosecution
has to be called into question.

1665
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:49,750
The motivation of the prosecution
is not an issue in a courtroom.

1666
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:53,750
In any courtroom I've ever been in,
except this one.

1667
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:54,833
Object.

1668
01:31:54,916 --> 01:31:57,458
[Hoffman] Mr. Kunstler, do you have
any further examination

1669
01:31:57,541 --> 01:32:01,583
that will demonstrate that this witness
will make a material contribution,

1670
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:04,291
or should I just ask him to step down?

1671
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:06,375
You've ruled.

1672
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:13,458
You're not gonna let the jury
hear his testimony.

1673
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:16,041
Not unless you can demonstrate to me,

1674
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:18,833
which you have not thus far done,
that this witness...

1675
01:32:18,916 --> 01:32:22,041
- Are you any good?
- Are you addressing the court reporter?

1676
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:23,583
- Keep up with us.
- Mr. Kunstler...

1677
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:25,375
Is this prosecution politically motivated?

1678
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:26,958
- Object!
- Yes.

1679
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,125
President Nixon inherited
an unpopular war.

1680
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,458
- Yes.
- Step down, Mr. Clark.

1681
01:32:30,541 --> 01:32:32,875
And your clients make it
more unpopular every day.

1682
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:37,625
This administration is paranoid
about the SDS, the Mobe, the New Left…

1683
01:32:37,708 --> 01:32:39,666
[Hoffman] Mr. Clark, please.

1684
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:44,791
Please, sir. I will be forced
to find you in contempt.

1685
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:46,625
Do you understand?

1686
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:50,250
I do, Your Honor.

1687
01:32:50,708 --> 01:32:52,625
Then step down, please.

1688
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:57,458
Thank you, sir.

1689
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:08,375
Just get to work on the appeal.

1690
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:21,250
Your Honor, when the jury returns,

1691
01:33:22,416 --> 01:33:26,250
will they be informed
that the defense had called

1692
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:29,416
the former attorney general
of the United States of America,

1693
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:33,250
but this court ruled
that he couldn't testify?

1694
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:36,250
No, that motion will be denied.

1695
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:38,875
[spectators murmuring]

1696
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:59,583
Cite Mr. Kunstler
with his third count of contempt.

1697
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:07,125
[David] You're a thug.

1698
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:09,416
Did one of the defendants speak?

1699
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:13,291
I did. I said you're a thug,
because you are.

1700
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:15,125
- Dave.
- Please sit, Mr. Dellinger.

1701
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:17,666
- If we're guilty, why not give us a trial?
- [Leonard] Dave.

1702
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,375
Marshals, seat the defendant.

1703
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:22,750
If we're guilty,
which you have clearly decided...

1704
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:24,333
- Dave, I've got...
- Watch yourself.

1705
01:34:24,416 --> 01:34:26,708
You've clearly decided
that we were, why not...

1706
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:29,333
No. You don't…
No, you don't need to grab my arm.

1707
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,958
If we're guilty, why not give us a trial?

1708
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:38,541
I mean, I have sat here for six months
and watched you!

1709
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:40,958
You don't need to grab my arm.

1710
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:43,250
I have watched you. I've watched you...

1711
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:44,333
Sir... [grunts]

1712
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:45,625
[spectators gasp]

1713
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:49,541
[Jerry] It's okay.
He would not hurt a fly.

1714
01:34:49,625 --> 01:34:51,208
Take him out of here. Lock him up.

1715
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:54,583
[handcuffs clinking]

1716
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:55,875
I hit him.

1717
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:58,875
I'm sorry.

1718
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:09,083
[softly] I'm sorry.

1719
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:29,833
[telephone ringing]

1720
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:45,791
There's only one thing.
There's one thing to do.

1721
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,875
Solidarity with Dave.

1722
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:52,291
Tomorrow, we go into court
and get ourselves arrested.

1723
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:54,541
We're already arrested.

1724
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,541
Is Bill talking to you
about taking the stand?

1725
01:35:58,166 --> 01:36:01,041
The press guys are saying
Bill's been talking to you about it.

1726
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,458
He's been talking about it.

1727
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:05,833
He thinks you might get the crowd
worked up with a position paper?

1728
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:09,416
Maybe he thinks I won't try
to get the crowd worked up at all.

1729
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,666
Maybe he thinks there are jurors
who relied on the safety of the police

1730
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:15,916
and are put off
when someone calls them pigs,

1731
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,416
or maybe he wants a witness
who dresses like a grown man.

1732
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:24,041
The cops in this city
in the summer of 1968 were pigs.

1733
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:26,750
I wonder how many of them
had kids in Vietnam.

1734
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:30,458
He's gonna take the stand, not you?

1735
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:32,291
And we're okay with that?

1736
01:36:33,916 --> 01:36:34,750
Abbie?

1737
01:36:34,833 --> 01:36:37,708
What did you mean,
the last thing I want is to end the war?

1738
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:39,166
What?

1739
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:43,375
Centuries ago when the trial started,
you said, why did I come to Chicago?

1740
01:36:43,458 --> 01:36:45,500
And I said, "To end the war."

1741
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:48,333
And then you turned to everyone
and you said,

1742
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:51,500
"The last thing he wants
is to end the war."

1743
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:54,958
What did you mean by that?

1744
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,500
That you're making the most
of your close-up.

1745
01:36:57,583 --> 01:36:58,666
Yeah…

1746
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:01,291
- No more war, no Abbie Hoffman.
- What's your problem with me?

1747
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:03,875
I wish people would stop asking me that.

1748
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:06,083
- Dave wouldn't want us to...
- Answer it.

1749
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:07,250
One time.

1750
01:37:08,041 --> 01:37:12,750
All right. My problem
is that for the next 50 years

1751
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:15,958
when people think of progressive politics,
they're gonna think of you.

1752
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:18,791
They're gonna think of you
and your idiot followers

1753
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:22,416
passing out daisies to soldiers
and trying to levitate the Pentagon.

1754
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,458
So they're not gonna think
of equality or justice,

1755
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:29,083
they're not gonna think
of education or poverty or progress.

1756
01:37:29,166 --> 01:37:31,958
They're gonna think
of a bunch of stoned, lost,

1757
01:37:32,041 --> 01:37:35,583
disrespectful, foul-mouthed,
lawless losers,

1758
01:37:36,166 --> 01:37:37,750
and so we'll lose elections.

1759
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:39,833
All because of me?

1760
01:37:40,708 --> 01:37:41,541
Yeah.

1761
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:44,333
Winning elections is the first thing
on your wish list?

1762
01:37:44,416 --> 01:37:48,500
Equality, justice, education, poverty
and progress, they're second?

1763
01:37:49,083 --> 01:37:52,416
If you don't win elections,
it doesn't matter what's second.

1764
01:37:52,958 --> 01:37:57,041
And it is astonishing to me that
someone still has to explain that to you.

1765
01:37:57,125 --> 01:37:58,125
[Rennie] Okay.

1766
01:37:58,833 --> 01:38:01,416
Okay, so, uh, Jerry was
talking about standing...

1767
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,708
We don't have any money.

1768
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:04,000
I'm sorry, what?

1769
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:05,583
We don't have any money.

1770
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,833
So I stage stunts, and cameras come
and microphones come,

1771
01:38:09,916 --> 01:38:13,583
and it's astonishing that someone
still has to explain that to <i>you.</i>

1772
01:38:13,666 --> 01:38:16,208
You're trading a cow for magic beans.

1773
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:17,875
[Jerry] That ended up working.

1774
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:19,083
What?

1775
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:21,958
The magic beans.
There was a giant up there.

1776
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:23,041
Oh, for fuck's...

1777
01:38:23,916 --> 01:38:27,333
I can't remember what happened after that.
The little boy may have gotten eaten...

1778
01:38:27,416 --> 01:38:29,125
[John] The giant turned out to be nice.

1779
01:38:29,208 --> 01:38:31,208
- [Jerry] Are you sure?
- No.

1780
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:33,916
It's hard to believe the seven of us
weren't able to end a war.

1781
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,125
Let me ask you something…

1782
01:38:35,208 --> 01:38:36,458
You guys should shake hands.

1783
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:39,875
Think Chicago would've gone differently
if Kennedy got the nomination?

1784
01:38:39,958 --> 01:38:41,500
Do I… [chuckles]

1785
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,000
- Just…
- [laughs] Yeah.

1786
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:46,708
Yes, I do. I think the Irish guys
would have sat down with Daley,

1787
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:47,875
and… Yes.

1788
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:49,750
- I think so too.
- Yeah?

1789
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:51,041
That's why I was wondering.

1790
01:38:51,958 --> 01:38:54,208
Weren't you just a little bit happy

1791
01:38:54,291 --> 01:38:57,083
when the bullet ripped through his head?

1792
01:38:57,916 --> 01:39:01,083
No Chicago, no Tom Hayden.

1793
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:04,666
I was one of the pallbearers,
you fucking animal!

1794
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:08,250
That's right, we're not goin' to jail
because of what we did,

1795
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:10,083
we're goin' to jail because of who we are!

1796
01:39:10,166 --> 01:39:13,666
Think about that the next time
you shrug off cultural revolution.

1797
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:18,041
We define winning differently, you and I.

1798
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:22,541
Bill, you should've seen it.

1799
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:26,125
Tom tried to beat me up, but through
sheer force of intellectual superiority...

1800
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:29,083
[Bill] Stop talking. Just stop talking.

1801
01:39:29,875 --> 01:39:32,958
Foran's office turned this over tonight.

1802
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:34,250
In discovery.

1803
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:37,541
It was given to them
by somebody in the crowd.

1804
01:39:37,625 --> 01:39:40,250
No foul play, there are affidavits.

1805
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,916
They really did just get this.

1806
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
[Tom] What's on the tape?

1807
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:47,041
The sound of you
starting the Chicago riot.

1808
01:39:49,333 --> 01:39:50,333
Hey. What?

1809
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:56,083
Somebody had a tape recorder
by the bandshell. They got you saying it.

1810
01:39:56,166 --> 01:39:58,958
It's a clear tape.
You can't take the stand.

1811
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:00,681
- I can handle Schultz and the tape.
- No.

1812
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:02,333
They'll play the tape anyway, right?

1813
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:05,416
If you take the stand, they'll make you
answer for it, and you can't.

1814
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:09,458
- They'd just cracked Rennie's head open.
- So you started a riot.

1815
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:11,458
- Defense rests.
- They had just cracked...

1816
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:13,666
- If blood is gonna flow…
- [Tom] Bill…

1817
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,541
…let it flow all over the city.

1818
01:40:15,625 --> 01:40:18,333
- They'd just clubbed Rennie.
- Everybody kept their cool.

1819
01:40:18,416 --> 01:40:21,625
Abbie, Dave...
Shit, this guy kept his cool.

1820
01:40:21,708 --> 01:40:23,166
You're the one who lost it.

1821
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,708
I can take the stand.

1822
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:28,375
[Bill] You wanna hear what cross
from Schultz will sound like?

1823
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:30,791
Sure. I'll show you
what my answers will sound like.

1824
01:40:30,875 --> 01:40:34,416
They called him a radical,
they called him a criminal!

1825
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:37,958
- They called him "Un-American."
- [crowd cheering]

1826
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:41,291
[Tom] <i>First of all, it turned out the guy
climbing the flagpole was a kid.</i>

1827
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:44,750
It seems like you guys attract
an awful lot of underage minors.

1828
01:40:44,833 --> 01:40:46,750
- Do you wanna object?
- Objection.

1829
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:48,666
- Overruled.
- [Tom] We attract the people

1830
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,041
who have the most to lose
by this war continuing.

1831
01:40:51,125 --> 01:40:53,041
I'm glad you brought that up.
Did you serve?

1832
01:40:53,125 --> 01:40:55,791
I wasn't drafted.
I didn't try to evade the…

1833
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:58,750
- I had a high number.
- High number? But you didn't enlist?

1834
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:01,166
I did not volunteer
to kill Vietnamese people, no.

1835
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:05,375
You testified you saw at least
six policemen start to go after the man…

1836
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:08,083
Sorry, the kid
who was climbing the flagpole?

1837
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:09,416
- Yes.
- [Bill] It was dark.

1838
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:12,666
You were 100 yards away.
What do you have, telescopic night-vision?

1839
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:14,000
There were floodlights.

1840
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:18,208
And when they called him
anti-American, he said, "No,

1841
01:41:18,291 --> 01:41:24,041
that ignominious distinction goes
to those who mouth America's values

1842
01:41:24,916 --> 01:41:27,208
while breaking America's heart."

1843
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:31,083
I'd like to introduce you now

1844
01:41:31,166 --> 01:41:33,041
to Carl Oglesby of the SDS!

1845
01:41:33,125 --> 01:41:34,833
[officer] Come on!

1846
01:41:36,291 --> 01:41:39,041
Hey, it's all right. He's a kid.
We'll get him down.

1847
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:44,000
Isn't it great to be here in Chicago!

1848
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:46,041
[all cheering]

1849
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:49,958
[officer] Come here.
Son of a bitch!

1850
01:41:50,041 --> 01:41:51,333
Hey, leave the kid alone!

1851
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:53,875
- [officer] Hold him!
- [Rennie] Hey!

1852
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:55,416
Jesus! What is wrong with…

1853
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,500
Rennie was trying
to get the police off of the kid.

1854
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:59,041
"Get the police off of the kid."

1855
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:00,041
- [Tom] Yes.
- How?

1856
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:01,833
- [sighs] He was...
- Grabbing them?

1857
01:42:01,916 --> 01:42:04,250
Get off of him! Hey! Get the...

1858
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:07,625
I'd like to say to the cops back there
that we're allowed to be here.

1859
01:42:07,708 --> 01:42:10,125
- We have permits for this.
- And out of nowhere…

1860
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:12,250
[grunts]

1861
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:15,791
It was six armed police officers versus
Rennie and a pocket protector.

1862
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:17,416
I can understand that response.

1863
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,541
How about your response? Let's press play.

1864
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:21,500
[John] <i>We're gonna need medics…</i>

1865
01:42:21,583 --> 01:42:23,458
The whole world is watching.

1866
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:27,041
[crowd chanting]
The whole world is watching!

1867
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:29,125
They've just beaten Rennie, Dave.

1868
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:31,875
Listen. We can still get
everyone out of here safely.

1869
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:33,250
No, we can't.

1870
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:36,750
[all chanting]
The whole world is watching!

1871
01:42:36,833 --> 01:42:38,625
<i>The whole world is watching!</i>

1872
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:42,333
Dellinger tried to stop you from saying
what you were about to say.

1873
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:43,791
Tell them to stay calm.

1874
01:42:43,875 --> 01:42:45,541
[crowd continues chanting]

1875
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:47,500
- No.
- The whole world is watching!

1876
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:49,833
- Tom?
- Did you tell 'em to stay calm?

1877
01:42:49,916 --> 01:42:54,958
Wait, Rennie Davis has just been
beaten by the police.

1878
01:42:55,041 --> 01:42:58,500
Rennie's skull has been cracked open.

1879
01:42:58,583 --> 01:43:01,083
- Did you tell your crowd to stay calm...
- Bill...

1880
01:43:01,166 --> 01:43:04,375
I'm Richard Schultz, Tom.
And John Mitchell told me to win.

1881
01:43:04,458 --> 01:43:06,750
Did you tell your crowd
to stay calm or...

1882
01:43:06,833 --> 01:43:08,541
Yes. If blood is gonna flow…

1883
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:10,916
…let it flow all over the city!

1884
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,458
- God damn it! Tom!
- [Tom] If gas is gonna be used,

1885
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:16,000
let it come down all over Chicago!

1886
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:18,916
We're going to the convention!
Let's get on the streets!

1887
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,625
Get on the street!

1888
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:25,458
"If blood is gonna flow,
let it flow all over the city."

1889
01:43:26,083 --> 01:43:28,958
What was that, an order
to start a peaceful demonstration?

1890
01:43:29,041 --> 01:43:30,500
[crowd clamoring]

1891
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:37,625
Once you had a moment to settle down,
did you try and stop people?

1892
01:43:37,708 --> 01:43:40,166
[tear gas canisters firing]

1893
01:43:47,958 --> 01:43:50,708
- Fuck you!
- Get off him!

1894
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:02,333
- You didn't try and stop anyone.
- No.

1895
01:44:02,416 --> 01:44:06,375
[Tom] The bridges!
Head to the bridges! The bridges!

1896
01:44:06,458 --> 01:44:08,541
You told them to go to the footbridges.

1897
01:44:08,625 --> 01:44:12,208
The ones able to make it out of the park
without getting arrested or maimed.

1898
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:14,875
And those people,
the ones you sent to the footbridges,

1899
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:17,000
did they know what was on the other side?

1900
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:26,708
[officer] You are ordered
to turn around immediately.

1901
01:44:26,791 --> 01:44:28,958
All access to the convention was blocked.

1902
01:44:29,041 --> 01:44:31,666
- [Tom] <i>By an armored division.
- The Illinois National Guard.</i>

1903
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:32,833
They're the good guys.

1904
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:35,500
Jeeps fitted with concertina wire
called Daley dozers.

1905
01:44:37,833 --> 01:44:39,708
When did I stop being
one of the good guys?

1906
01:44:39,791 --> 01:44:42,833
Let's find out.
Were glass bottles thrown at the police?

1907
01:44:42,916 --> 01:44:44,333
We want justice!

1908
01:44:45,833 --> 01:44:48,958
No, don't approach! Stay back! Stay…

1909
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:51,916
Some people threw bottles.
Dave was trying to shut it down.

1910
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,833
We were frustrated.
All three footbridges...

1911
01:44:53,916 --> 01:44:56,708
So you, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others
eluded the police.

1912
01:44:56,791 --> 01:44:59,416
I wouldn't say we eluded them.
We were fleeing from them.

1913
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:00,958
Found an unguarded bridge…

1914
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:07,750
Now here's where things got weird.

1915
01:45:07,833 --> 01:45:11,750
You, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others
found the only way to the convention.

1916
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,291
In the lobby of the Hilton,
right next to the convention center,

1917
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:17,791
is a bar called the Haymarket Tavern.

1918
01:45:17,875 --> 01:45:21,125
The Haymarket Tavern is a watering hole

1919
01:45:21,208 --> 01:45:23,625
for Chicago's political class
and their hookers.

1920
01:45:23,708 --> 01:45:25,750
[crowd laughing]

1921
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:30,208
And the place was packed to watch Humphrey
getting the nomination a mile away.

1922
01:45:30,291 --> 01:45:32,051
[man on TV]
<i>From the House of Representatives</i>

1923
01:45:32,083 --> 01:45:34,375
<i>who represents the great state of Ohio,</i>

1924
01:45:34,458 --> 01:45:36,541
<i>representative Wayne Hays to the stage.</i>

1925
01:45:36,625 --> 01:45:38,500
[Hays] <i>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</i>

1926
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:41,250
<i>The great state of Ohio,
the Buckeye State...</i>

1927
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:42,583
[all] The Buckeye State!

1928
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:47,625
One side of the Haymarket Tavern
is a picture window with smoked glass.

1929
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:49,916
<i>You can't see inside it from the street.</i>

1930
01:45:50,875 --> 01:45:52,500
You made it through the riot police,

1931
01:45:52,583 --> 01:45:55,666
tear gas, the National Guard,
you're in sight of the convention center.

1932
01:45:58,125 --> 01:45:59,416
[police radio chatter]

1933
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,166
- Where we got trapped.
- What's another word for trapped?

1934
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:08,333
We were trapped
between the window and the police.

1935
01:46:08,416 --> 01:46:09,750
What's another word for trapped?

1936
01:46:12,208 --> 01:46:13,250
Caught, right?

1937
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,875
Inside the bar,
it's like the '60s never happened.

1938
01:46:19,958 --> 01:46:23,375
Outside the bar,
the '60s were being performed

1939
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:25,250
for anyone who looked out of the window.

1940
01:46:26,041 --> 01:46:27,583
Anyone know what a buckeye is?

1941
01:46:27,666 --> 01:46:28,916
- [man] Buckeye?
- Yeah.

1942
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,375
[man] A buckeye is a nut. A poisonous nut.

1943
01:46:31,458 --> 01:46:32,666
Hey.

1944
01:46:33,333 --> 01:46:35,875
[woman on TV] <i>94 votes
for Vice President Humphrey.</i>

1945
01:46:35,958 --> 01:46:38,625
Am I the only one who sees
what's going on out there?

1946
01:46:38,708 --> 01:46:42,166
And we see a cop do something
you don't ever wanna see a cop do.

1947
01:46:47,875 --> 01:46:52,875
'60s outside the bar, '50s inside the bar.

1948
01:46:53,583 --> 01:46:57,000
And then, an unnecessary metaphor.

1949
01:46:57,083 --> 01:46:58,083
It's a nut.

1950
01:46:58,708 --> 01:47:00,125
- What?
- A nut!

1951
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:02,541
[people scream]

1952
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:04,125
Were you resisting arrest?

1953
01:47:04,208 --> 01:47:07,375
- They pushed us through the window!
- You overrun the riot police…

1954
01:47:07,458 --> 01:47:08,958
Which is more than Rennie can say!

1955
01:47:09,041 --> 01:47:13,041
Over 400 people admitted
to area hospitals with severe injuries!

1956
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:17,916
They had armored vehicles and bayonets!
They took off their name tags and badges!

1957
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,416
We were trying to protest peacefully
at the fucking convention!

1958
01:47:25,416 --> 01:47:27,416
- [grunts]
- [police radio chatter]

1959
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:37,375
[officer] Hands behind your back.

1960
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:40,458
Yeah.

1961
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,791
[Bill] <i>Who started the riot, Tom?</i>

1962
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Our…

1963
01:47:53,208 --> 01:47:54,208
What?

1964
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Our…

1965
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,541
Our blood.

1966
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:03,708
[chuckles] "Our blood."

1967
01:48:04,875 --> 01:48:06,791
"If our blood is gonna flow…"

1968
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:09,583
You meant to say,

1969
01:48:10,541 --> 01:48:14,000
"If <i>our</i> blood is gonna flow,
then let it flow all over the city."

1970
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:15,500
You didn't mean the cops.

1971
01:48:15,583 --> 01:48:19,125
You were saying, "If they're gonna
beat us up, everyone should see it."

1972
01:48:24,541 --> 01:48:25,791
Jesus Christ!

1973
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:28,875
You do this…
He does this, it's a pattern.

1974
01:48:28,958 --> 01:48:31,250
Read his portion
of the Port Huron Statement.

1975
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:36,250
He implies possessive pronouns
and uses vague noun modifiers.

1976
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:40,250
You read the Port Huron Statement?

1977
01:48:40,333 --> 01:48:42,000
I've read everything you've published.

1978
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,833
I didn't know that.

1979
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:46,333
You're a talented guy.

1980
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,291
- Except for the possessive pronouns.
- I know.

1981
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:51,000
And the vague noun modifiers.

1982
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,583
Put Abbie on the stand instead.

1983
01:49:06,166 --> 01:49:09,000
[Hoffman] <i>Would you state your full name
for the record, please?</i>

1984
01:49:09,583 --> 01:49:10,583
It's Abbie.

1985
01:49:11,208 --> 01:49:12,208
[Hoffman] Last name.

1986
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:14,875
My grandfather's name was Shaboysnakoff,

1987
01:49:14,958 --> 01:49:18,041
but he was a Russian Jew
protesting anti-Semitism,

1988
01:49:18,125 --> 01:49:21,291
so he was assigned a name
that would sound like yours.

1989
01:49:22,083 --> 01:49:23,875
What is your date of birth?

1990
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:26,375
Psychologically, 1960.

1991
01:49:26,458 --> 01:49:29,250
[Hoffman] What were you doing until 1960?

1992
01:49:29,333 --> 01:49:32,500
Nothing. I believe it's called
an American education.

1993
01:49:32,583 --> 01:49:33,708
[spectators laugh]

1994
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:36,666
Why don't we just proceed
with the testimony?

1995
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:37,916
Sure.

1996
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,875
Abbie, do you know
why you're on trial here?

1997
01:49:42,166 --> 01:49:45,041
We carried certain ideas
across state lines.

1998
01:49:46,208 --> 01:49:49,125
Not machine guns
or drugs or little girls.

1999
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:50,416
Ideas.

2000
01:49:51,458 --> 01:49:54,166
When we crossed from New York
to New Jersey to Pennsylvania

2001
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:57,791
to Ohio to Illinois, we had certain ideas.

2002
01:49:57,875 --> 01:49:59,208
And for that,

2003
01:50:00,083 --> 01:50:03,375
we were gassed, beaten,
arrested and put on trial.

2004
01:50:03,458 --> 01:50:04,333
Okay.

2005
01:50:04,416 --> 01:50:09,208
In 1861, Lincoln said
in his inaugural address,

2006
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:12,708
"When the people shall grow weary
of their constitutional right

2007
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:13,958
to amend their government,

2008
01:50:14,041 --> 01:50:16,625
they shall exert their revolutionary right

2009
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:20,666
to dismember and overthrow
that government."

2010
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:25,125
And if Lincoln had given that speech
in Lincoln Park last summer,

2011
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:27,416
he'd be put on trial with the rest of us.

2012
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:31,958
So how do you overthrow or dismember,
as you say, your government peacefully?

2013
01:50:32,833 --> 01:50:35,208
In this country,
we do it every four years.

2014
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:38,291
That's all.

2015
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:53,083
[chuckles] So Chicago was just
a massive voter registration drive.

2016
01:50:53,166 --> 01:50:55,916
[chuckles] Yeah.

2017
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,083
Did you hear the tape we played
of Tom Hayden?

2018
01:50:59,166 --> 01:51:00,708
- Yes.
- You heard the tape?

2019
01:51:00,791 --> 01:51:03,791
Did you hear Mr. Hayden
give an instruction to his people

2020
01:51:03,875 --> 01:51:05,041
to take to the streets?

2021
01:51:05,125 --> 01:51:09,333
"His people"?
Hayden's not a Mafia don and neither am I.

2022
01:51:09,416 --> 01:51:10,500
Did you hear him say,

2023
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:13,875
"If blood is gonna flow,
let it flow all over the city"?

2024
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:17,291
[chuckles] The beginning of that sentence
was supposed to be…

2025
01:51:18,791 --> 01:51:20,250
Yes. Yes, I did.

2026
01:51:21,583 --> 01:51:22,625
What'd you think of that?

2027
01:51:25,625 --> 01:51:28,958
I think Tom Hayden is a badass
of an American patriot.

2028
01:51:30,916 --> 01:51:34,625
I didn't ask what you thought of the man,
I asked of his instruction of the crowd.

2029
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:38,291
I've also heard Tom Hayden say,
"Let's end the war,"

2030
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:40,250
but nobody stopped shooting.

2031
01:51:40,916 --> 01:51:44,958
You can do anything to anything
by taking it out of context, Mr. Schultz.

2032
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:48,916
"If blood is gonna flow"?
How do you take that out of context?

2033
01:51:49,958 --> 01:51:54,916
A guy once said, "I am come to set a man
at variance with his father

2034
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,250
and the daughter against her mother."
You know who said it?

2035
01:51:59,083 --> 01:52:00,083
Jerry Rubin.

2036
01:52:00,125 --> 01:52:01,708
[chuckles] Yes.

2037
01:52:02,375 --> 01:52:03,375
No.

2038
01:52:03,875 --> 01:52:05,333
It was Jesus Christ.

2039
01:52:05,416 --> 01:52:07,416
Matthew 10:35.

2040
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,000
And it sure sounds like
he's telling kids to kill their parents.

2041
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:15,083
Until you read Matthew 10:34 and 10:36.

2042
01:52:15,958 --> 01:52:16,791
Do you have...

2043
01:52:16,875 --> 01:52:19,791
He'd just seen his best friend
get hit in the head with a nightstick.

2044
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:23,708
The police, Mr. Schultz,
whose people are they?

2045
01:52:24,291 --> 01:52:27,000
- Do you have contempt for your government?
- Do I...

2046
01:52:27,083 --> 01:52:30,416
Yeah, do you have contempt
for your government?

2047
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:35,708
I think the institutions of our democracy
are wonderful things

2048
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:38,791
that right now are populated
by some terrible people.

2049
01:52:38,875 --> 01:52:40,416
Please answer the question.

2050
01:52:41,125 --> 01:52:42,250
Tell me again?

2051
01:52:48,916 --> 01:52:50,625
Do you have contempt for your government?

2052
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:54,875
I'll tell you, it's nothing compared to
the contempt my government has for me.

2053
01:52:54,958 --> 01:52:58,833
We've heard testimony
from 27 witnesses, under oath,

2054
01:52:58,916 --> 01:53:02,750
that say you hoped
for a confrontation with the police,

2055
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:06,166
that your plans for the convention
were designed specifically

2056
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,666
to draw the police into a confrontation.

2057
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,625
If I'd known it was gonna be
the first wish of mine that came true,

2058
01:53:11,708 --> 01:53:12,875
I would've aimed higher.

2059
01:53:12,958 --> 01:53:15,000
It's a yes or no question.
When you came to Chicago,

2060
01:53:15,083 --> 01:53:18,583
were you hoping for a confrontation
with the police?

2061
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:31,541
I'm concerned you have to think about it.

2062
01:53:32,458 --> 01:53:34,125
Give me a moment, would you, friend?

2063
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:37,375
I've never been on trial
for my thoughts before.

2064
01:54:04,958 --> 01:54:05,958
[door opens]

2065
01:54:21,583 --> 01:54:23,375
[door opens]

2066
01:54:23,458 --> 01:54:24,666
[bailiff] All rise.

2067
01:54:26,708 --> 01:54:28,750
69 CR 180,

2068
01:54:28,833 --> 01:54:32,166
United States of America
v. David Dellinger et al.

2069
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:46,458
The law requires that before sentencing,

2070
01:54:46,541 --> 01:54:51,458
I allow the defendant or defendants
to make a statement to the court.

2071
01:54:51,541 --> 01:54:56,458
I've advised defense counsel
that the court will allow one defendant

2072
01:54:56,541 --> 01:54:59,791
to speak for the group,
and I've been advised

2073
01:54:59,875 --> 01:55:01,791
the group has chosen Mr. Hayden.

2074
01:55:01,875 --> 01:55:04,291
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

2075
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:08,875
Mr. Hayden, in spite of your actions
during the convention,

2076
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:13,125
you are the one defendant
who has shown, during this trial,

2077
01:55:13,791 --> 01:55:17,875
respect for this court
and for this country,

2078
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:20,416
and remorse for those actions.

2079
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:23,291
I truly believe… And I mean this.

2080
01:55:24,625 --> 01:55:30,791
I truly believe that one day you will be
a very productive part of our system.

2081
01:55:31,666 --> 01:55:36,916
I'd like you to make your statement brief
and without political content of any kind.

2082
01:55:37,625 --> 01:55:39,625
If you make your statement brief,

2083
01:55:39,708 --> 01:55:44,375
if you make it respectful, if you make it
remorseful and to the point,

2084
01:55:45,208 --> 01:55:49,166
I will look favorably upon that
when administering my sentence.

2085
01:55:51,291 --> 01:55:53,208
Do you understand what I've just said?

2086
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:56,375
Mr. Hayden?

2087
01:55:57,208 --> 01:55:58,208
[Tom] Yes, sir.

2088
01:55:59,041 --> 01:56:01,958
- You'll look favorably in sentencing.
- Yes.

2089
01:56:03,666 --> 01:56:07,083
If I make my statement
respectful and remorseful.

2090
01:56:07,166 --> 01:56:08,166
Yes.

2091
01:56:11,583 --> 01:56:13,833
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
what was the third one?

2092
01:56:14,458 --> 01:56:15,458
Brief.

2093
01:56:15,958 --> 01:56:16,958
Brief.

2094
01:56:19,625 --> 01:56:22,958
If I do these things,
my government will look favorably on me.

2095
01:56:23,041 --> 01:56:24,250
You understand?

2096
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:26,250
Yes, sir.

2097
01:56:27,916 --> 01:56:29,166
Please begin.

2098
01:56:30,791 --> 01:56:31,791
Okay.

2099
01:56:33,708 --> 01:56:36,458
Your Honor, since this trial began,

2100
01:56:38,125 --> 01:56:42,416
4,752 US troops
have been killed in Vietnam.

2101
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:48,166
And the following… are their names.

2102
01:56:49,666 --> 01:56:52,833
- [spectators murmuring]
- "Private First Class Dennis Walter Kipp,

2103
01:56:52,916 --> 01:56:54,458
18 years old."

2104
01:56:55,041 --> 01:56:58,458
- "Private Eric Alan Bosch, 21 years old."
- [gavel bangs]

2105
01:56:58,541 --> 01:56:59,541
[Hoffman] Mr. Kunstler!

2106
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:02,958
"Lance Corporal Robert Earl Ellis,
19 years old."

2107
01:57:03,041 --> 01:57:06,500
Mr. Kunstler! He will not read

2108
01:57:06,583 --> 01:57:09,125
5,000 names for the record!

2109
01:57:09,208 --> 01:57:12,375
"Robert Ford, 21 years old."

2110
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:13,458
There will be order!

2111
01:57:13,541 --> 01:57:16,416
[Tom] "Staff Sergeant David Cruz Chavez,
31 years old."

2112
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,083
"Lance Corporal Douglas W. Jackson,
19 years old."

2113
01:57:21,166 --> 01:57:22,875
[Hoffman] There will be order!

2114
01:57:22,958 --> 01:57:27,250
[Tom] "Private First Class
William Melvin Johnson, 20 years old."

2115
01:57:27,333 --> 01:57:28,583
There will be order!

2116
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:31,125
- "Lance Corporal Robert Ryan Hammond…"
- There will be order!

2117
01:57:31,208 --> 01:57:32,291
"…19 years old."

2118
01:57:32,375 --> 01:57:35,500
"Corporal Philip Lawrence Jewell,
20 years old."

2119
01:57:35,583 --> 01:57:40,875
- [Hoffman] He will not read 4,500 names!
- "Sergeant Brian John Morrow, 19 years."

2120
01:57:40,958 --> 01:57:45,458
"Master Sergeant James Warren Finsel,
36 years old."

2121
01:57:45,541 --> 01:57:47,125
- There will be order!
- [all cheering]

2122
01:57:47,208 --> 01:57:50,791
"Technical Sergeant

"Corporal David Michael King,

2125
01:58:01,083 --> 01:58:03,291
- "Specialist Keith Harold Reitz…"
- [Hoffman] Order!

2126
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:05,625
"…21 years old."

2127
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:07,625
[Hoffman] Put that down!

2128
01:58:07,708 --> 01:58:12,208
"Private First Class
James Clinton DeFranco, 19 years old."

2129

2130

"First Lieutenant Donald Bryan Mancill,

2131
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:25,583
What are you doin'?

2132
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,375
Respect for the fallen.

2133
01:58:29,916 --> 01:58:31,583
Let's show 'em some respect, sir.

2134
01:58:31,666 --> 01:58:32,833
[Tom] "…25 years old."

2135
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,083
