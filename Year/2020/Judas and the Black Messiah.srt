Looking back on your

21
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:48,483
No individual
creates a rebellion.

22
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,150

Huey P. Newton.

28

<i>In jail.</i>

30
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,400
<i>The first thing that
the Black Panther Party did, of course,</i>

31
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:19,692
<i>in Oakland, was to set up
an armed patrol</i>

32
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,150
in order to ensure

33
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,692
that Black people were not
harassed and intimidated

34
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,942
by the local police department.

35
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,650
And if the police
arrested the individual,

36
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:31,150
we'd follow him to the jail
and bail the individual out,

37
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,733
whether he was
a Panther or not.

38
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,650

That's what we're talkin' about.

42
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:43,108
Yeah, we armed.
We a armed propaganda union,

43
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:47,192

Well, it was reported stolen
two months ago.

- Hell, no! That's my car!

- Let me go.
- Be easy, be easy, all right?

94
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,983
I got the papers on it
and everything.

95
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,858
You're under arrest
for grand theft auto.

96
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:33,983
- I didn't do nothin'!
- Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge.

97
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,650
Say, man, what the fuck is the FBI
doing lookin' for a stolen car, huh?

98
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:36,775
Y'all ran out of niggas
to assassinate?

99
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:39,692
- Motherfucker.
- Shit!

100
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:45,275
Hey, hey, hey, tough guy.
No wise eye.

101
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,025
You be easy, right?
No funny eye.

102
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,692
He ain't nothin'
but a kid.

103
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,733
You ain't no fucking cop,
nigga.

104
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:54,942
Stay the fuck back!

105
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,192
Get him!

106
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,525
- Get out the car!
- Fall back!

107
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:10,900
Oh, shit!

108
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,192
Get your ass out here!

109
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,608
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out of here!

110
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:15,567
Get that out
of my fucking chest! Shit!

111
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,608
Ahh!

112
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,233
Get the fuck off my shit!

113
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,733
Fuck off this shit!

114
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,608
Punk motherfucker!

115
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,400
Special Agent Mitchell,
FBI.

116
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:59,317
Almost as spiffy as yours.

117
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:13,942
Now, tell me, why the badge?

118
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:21,067
Why not just use a knife or a
gun like a normal car thief?

119
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,108
A badge is scarier than a gun.

120
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:34,817
Would you mind
explaining that for me?

121
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:41,275
Any nigga on the streets can get a gun...
Sir.

122
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:47,525
A badge is like you got the
whole damn army behind you.

123
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:54,025
I better
hold on to this, then.

124
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,817
Were you upset
when Dr. King was murdered?

125
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,150
What?

126
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,650
Were you upset
when Dr. King was murdered?

127
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:14,400
I don't know.

128
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:17,608
You can be honest.

129
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,567
Well, I was a little bit, yeah.

130
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,983
And what about Malcolm X?

131
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:30,233
I ain't ever thought
about all that.

132
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,608
You just never
thought about it?

133
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:36,358
No.

134
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:47,983
You're looking at 18 months
for the stolen car

135
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:51,525
and five years for
impersonating a federal officer.

136
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,733
Or you can go home.

137
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,775
...that reflected the
population and the culture

138
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:12,233
of the 80% Black student body.

139
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,442
So they're bringing in
Dr. Charles Hurst

140
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,733
from Howard University
to be president.

141
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,900
And they're gonna call it
Malcolm X College from now on.

142
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,442
It's in this
spirit of activism,

143
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:31,692
and on behalf of the Wright
Junior College of Black Caucus,

144
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,567
I am proud to introduce

145
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,108
Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton of
the Illinois Black Panther Party.

146
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:46,817
I don't need no mic.
Can y'all hear me?

147
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,775
Yeah!

148
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:48,775
Right on.

149
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,358
Malcolm X College,
I can dig it.

150
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:03,692
Dr. Charles Hurst, direct from Howard.
Right on.

151
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:07,317
So, what?

152
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,192
You think the students over
there gonna be free now?

153
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:17,942
Oh, they'll let you change the name
of your college, or your own name,

154
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:21,442
throw on a dashiki.
'Cause guess what?

155
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:23,400
They still gonna drag
your Black ass to Vietnam

156
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:27,067
to shoot a poor rice farmer
or get shot your damn self.

157
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,233
That's the difference
between revolution

158
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:32,608
and the candy-coated facade
of gradual reform.

159
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:35,108
Reform is just the masters
teaching the slaves

160
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:36,733
how to be better slaves.

161
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:39,067
Under reform, you could take
the motherfucking masters out,

162
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,483
and the slaves still be doin'
all the work for 'em.

163
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:46,942
There's a man
called a capitalist.

164
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:50,608
Don't matter what color he is, black,
white, brown, red, don't matter.

165
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:54,025
Because the capitalist
has one goal.

166
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,567
And that is
to exploit the people.

167
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,150
He can have on a three-piece
suit or a dashiki,

168
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:03,025
'cause political power doesn't
flow from the sleeve of a dashiki.

169
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:06,442
Political power flows
from the barrel of a gun.

170
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,692
We in the Black Panther Party
don't believe in no culture

171
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:10,400
except revolutionary culture.

172
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,567
What we mean by that is a
culture that will free you!

173
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,650
Don't give me no five-and-dime costume
of a medicine man or a witch doctor

174
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:20,400
or whatever you think
the motherland look like.

175
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:25,858
Give me the righteous threads
of a Mozambican FRELIMO fighter.

176
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:30,025
Give me... Give me a AK-47,

177
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:32,650
or some bandoliers
like they got in Angola!

178
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,525
Give me some Colt .45s for the folks
that are trying to free themselves!

179
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:48,817
Brother.

180
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,900
A dashiki ain't gonna help you

181
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:53,275
when they come up
in here with them tanks

182
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:55,275
like they did in Henry Horner.

183
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:57,108
You need tools, brother.

184
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:59,317
We got the tools
at 75th and Madison.

185
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,567
Can you spare
a little change, brother?

186
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,900
Sister, spare a little change?

187
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:09,775
Hi.

188
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,483
Evenin'.

189
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:15,650
Thought your speech
was really interesting.

190
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,233
Well, thank you, sister.

191
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:21,400
Do you like poetry?

192
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:27,067
I mean, it's cool,
but as Che Guevara said...

193
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,233
"Words are beautiful,
but action is supreme," you dig?

194
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,775
I dig. Right on.

195
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:41,525
But you were up on that stage
using words, so...

196
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:45,108
Maybe next time,
choose 'em a bit more carefully,

197
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:46,567
instead of tearin' down
the folk

198
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,233
who you call yourself
recruitin',

199
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:51,192
just because they demonstrate
a little Black pride.

200
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:58,025
But just so you know,
you are a poet.

201
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,317
<i>Somebody
define war for me.</i>

202
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:09,275
War is a violent conflict
between two or more parties.

203
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:13,317
Would you say we at war
with the pigs, Comrade Palmer?

204
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,150
Chairman, I'd take it
a step further and say

205
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,608
that every ghetto
across the nation

206
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,233
should be considered
occupied territory.

207
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:19,358
Right on.

208
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:22,192
Well, how about politics?

209
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,733
How would you define politics,
Brother Winters?

210
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,817
Uh...

211
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,983
You know, elections.

212
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,400
Elections can be part
of politics, certainly.

213
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:32,858
But we in the party

214
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,608
ascribe to Chairman Mao's
definition of politics.

215
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:38,733
He said, "War is politics
with bloodshed,

216
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,192
and politics is war
without bloodshed."

217
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,275
Say it with me, y'all.

218
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:45,442
"War is politics
with bloodshed.

219
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,400
Politics is war
without bloodshed."

220
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:49,983
Now, what that mean?

221
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,733
It mean every time
the pigs shoot down

222
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,817
an unarmed brother
or sister in the street,

223
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,150
Mayor Daley pulled the trigger.

224
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,192
It mean Tricky Dicky Nixon

225
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:01,900
is the fattest,
most filthy pig in the pen.

226
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:07,358
So, how we win this war?

227
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:09,692
What's our most lethal weapon?

228
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:13,317
Guns? Grenades?

229
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,442
Rocket launchers?

230
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,650
These niggas
got rocket launchers?

231
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:28,942
There's strength
in numbers.

232
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,317
Power anywhere there's people.

233
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,192
And in order to
overthrow this racist,

234
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:37,692
fascist, nefarious U.S.
government, it's gonna take everybody.

235
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:39,900
Black Panther paper!
Free your mind for just a quarter.

236
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,317
Sorry, I'm on my way to work.

237
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,608
Well, I'm at work, sister.
I work for you.

238
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,483
Information is raw material
for new ideas.

239
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,567
Oh, you got kids?

240
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,358
- Your friends got kids?
- Yeah.

241
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:52,275
Well, we got a breakfast
program feedin' 300 kids a week.

242
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,400
<i>Because we've grown
so accustomed to being poor,</i>

243
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:56,733
<i>we think it's normal for our
kids to go to school hungry.</i>

244
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:59,567
<i>We think it's normal for us to go
to the hospital with a runny nose</i>

245
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,400
<i>and come home in a body bag.</i>

246
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,150
So, our job
as the Black Panther Party

247
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,900
is to heighten
the contradictions.

248
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:08,150
I pledge allegiance...

249
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,400
I pledge allegiance...

250
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:10,608
...to my Black people.

251
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,108
...to my Black people.

252
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,483
I pledge to develop...

253
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,483
I pledge to develop...

254
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,358
<i>...my mind and body to
the greatest extent possible.</i>

255
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:20,942
...my mind and body to the
greatest extent possible.

256
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,442
I will learn all that I can...

257
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:24,608
I will learn
all that I can...

258
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,942
...in order to give my best to my
people in the struggle for liberation.

259
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:29,317
...in order to give
my best to my people

260
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,192
in the struggle for liberation.

261
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:35,108
So, the people can decide if they
wanna overthrow the government

262
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:36,400
or not.

263
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,483
These two people are waiting
to see you from VISTA.

264
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,525
Also, Brother Cohran called.

265
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,608
He wanted to know if you willing to
speak at a fundraiser at the theater,

266
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:47,942
and somebody named
Stanley Uhuru

267
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:50,150
said he wanted to speak to you
about a credit union.

268
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,567
What's that?

269
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,400
EKG machine.

270
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:56,525
For the clinic,
when we get it up and running.

271
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:57,775
Mm-hmm.

272
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,233
The poet.
What a pleasant surprise.

273
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:12,025
I saw your ad in the paper
lookin' for a new speechwriter.

274
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:13,817
I figured I'd better
come lend a hand.

275
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,733
Well, that must have
been a misprint.

276
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,483
See, I don't write speeches,
sister.

277
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,650
I just get up on stage and
speak truth to the people.

278
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:23,817
Oh, it shows.
The lack of preparation, that is.

279
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,150
It got you here.

280
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:31,483
<i>"We want land, bread,
housing, education, clothing...</i>

281
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,692
justice, and peace."

282
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:37,733
"Housing, justice, peace."

283
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:39,525
Life, liberty, happiness.

284
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,692
I mean, it's all right there in
the Declaration of Independence.

285
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,192
But when poor people demand it,
it's a contradiction.

286
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:46,692
It's not democracy,
it's socialism, dig?

287
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:48,483
We can do something after
this, if you want to.

288
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,108
O'Neal, stand up.

289
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:06,692
What is the party line in
regards to our sisters, comrade?

290
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,567
Um...

291
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,275
Anybody?

292
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,317
"Do not take
liberties with women."

293
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,192
Oh, come on now.
I ain't takin' no goddamn...

294
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:21,692
These aren't just your sisters.
They're your sisters-in-arms.

295
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,358
Act like it.

296
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,775
Twenty push-ups for discipline.

297
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:31,900
Captain Harmon...

298
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,900
count 'em out.

299
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:36,733
<i>What's wrong, O'Neal?</i>

300
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:39,192
Down to the ground!

301
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,900
You scared of a little dirt?

302
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:45,608
I could have a sister
put a towel down for ya.

303
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,275
You ain't tell me
it was gonna be like this.

304
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,817
These motherfuckers
ain't no terrorists.

305
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,817
Shit, they terrorizing me.

306
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,275
What can I do to help?

307
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:12,025
The goal is to get close to Hampton.
So, think.

308
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,942
What does he need

309
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:19,400
that maybe your Uncle Sam might
be able to help you provide?

310
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:25,275
A car.

311
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,317
Fred don't drive no more.
'Cause the pigs always...

312
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,567
Shit, the police.

313
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,650
No, that's good.

314
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,775
You're becoming a Panther.

315
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:41,400
The pigs are always
followin' him around,

316
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:44,733
givin' him bullshit traffic
violations, right? So,

317
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:48,067
if you want me
to get close to Fred,

318
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,483
give me a car.

319
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:45,442
Jimmy, come on, man.

320
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,525
Say, Chairman,
that wasn't no goddamn pig

321
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:49,317
you was eatin' out there,
was it?

322
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,442
Somebody gotta show the pig
who's boss, man.

323
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,775
All right,
y'all ready to split? Huh?

324
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:06,567
Y'all got weapons?
Give 'em here.

325
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,983
Now, Judy, you is out
of your rabbit-ass mind

326
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:17,400
if you don't get your
motherfuckin' boot off my shit.

327
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,317
Shit.

328
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:30,108
Yo, Winters,
how many pistols you got, man?

329
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:31,483
What about you?

330
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:35,358
Mine's in the glove box.
Motherfucker.

331
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,108
Park as close to Leon's
as you can,

332
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,900
in case we gotta haul ass
outta there.

333
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,733
Chairman,
that's the Crowns' pool hall.

334
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:46,317
Exactly. Stay sharp.

335
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:52,942
Hey, Chairman,
what are we doin' here?

336
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:57,608
Getting
the Crowns' attention.

337
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:16,275
Evenin',
brothers and sisters.

338
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,108
I wanted to hip y'all to a new
free breakfast program

339
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,108
opening on the South Side
next week.

340
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,442
Free for the babies.

341
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:24,775
All you gotta do
is drop your little ones off

342
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:27,192
and we'll take care
of the rest.

343
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:30,733
Stop on by to Saint Andrew's
and check us out.

344
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:33,025
And if you're on the West Side or
you got family on the West Side,

345
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,650
we at the Better Boys Club,
Monday through Friday.

346
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,025
The Illinois Black Panther
Party has a mandate

347
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:41,650
to feed every hungry kid
in Chicago.

348
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,442
I'm not talkin' about handing
out turkeys on Thanksgiving,

349
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:44,692
that's charity.

350
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:46,692
Save that for the pushers
and the preachers

351
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:49,483
who call themselves doin' you a
favor after they done sucked you dry.

352
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,275
Fuck charity.

353
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:53,525
The Black Panther Party
believes in progression.

354
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,608
Now, what that mean?

355
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:58,358
That mean, first,
you have free breakfast,

356
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,108
then you have free healthcare,

357
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,983
then you have free education.

358
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,817
Next thing you know, you look up,
you done freed your motherfuckin' self!

359
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,483
Know where you at,
motherfucker?

360
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,608
This is Crowns territory.

361
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:15,858
We don't want no trouble,
brother.

362
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:17,192
We just passin' through.

363
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:19,733
Besides, the rap we on
is a political one.

364
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:21,108
It shouldn't really
concern y'all.

365
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:23,525
Nigga, don't lecture me
on politics.

366
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,775
The Crowns protected Martin Luther
King when he was here in 1966.

367
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:28,983
And he got
his head split open.

368
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,275
Damn near killed by a mob of
crackers throwin' Irish confetti.

369
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:32,650
Bang-up job y'all did.

370
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,108
Hey, hey, hey!
Get the fuck back!

371
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:36,442
Get the fuck back, nigga!
Back up!

372
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:38,650
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

373
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,025
No need for that, brother.

374
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:42,775
We on our way.

375
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:47,400
But dig, I got a message
for the big man.

376
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:51,358
Tell him the Panthers wanna
sit down with the Crowns.

377
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:54,108
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

378
00:23:09,317 --> 00:23:11,608
You sure you wanna go sit
down with the Crowns, Chairman?

379
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:13,067
Hell, yeah.

380
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,817
Imagine the Panthers,
the Stones, the Crowns,

381
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,317
and the Disciples fighting
under one revolutionary army.

382
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,608
Them pigs ain't ready for that.

383
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,775
Shit.

384
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:25,567
I'll tell y'all one thing.

385
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,442
I'm bringin' my motherfuckin'
pistols to that goddamn meeting.

386
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,900
And you hear me, Chairman?
Shit.

387
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:33,650
Maybe one of yours, too, nigga.

388
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:36,108
All you need is a pool
stick, ain't that right, O'Neal?

389
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,692
You see him swinging
that thing around?

390
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:44,650
Hey, don't you underestimate my
skill, God damn it! None of y'all!

391
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:45,733
You got heart, Bill.

392
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:48,025
You wild, but you got heart.

393
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:50,275
Wild Bill.

394
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:53,650
Wild Bill! Wow! Wild Bill!

395
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:56,358
Man, tell me they ain't
call you that in Maywood!

396
00:23:56,442 --> 00:23:59,108
Nah, man,
they ain't call me nothing.

397
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:00,400
Nah?

398
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:01,775
Shit, I mighta heard it
once or twice.

399
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,733
See, I knew it! I knew it!
Wild Bill!

400
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,317
Yeah!

401
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,317
God damn it, Harmon,
you and these goddamn cognomen.

402
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,900
- Oh, man...
- Wild Bill!

403
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:11,317
Pool stick to a gun fight, man.

404
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,192
Wild Bill.

405
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,942
Come on in,
make yourself at home in the den.

406
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:43,817
This is Samantha.

407
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:49,983
<i>What made you think
you could trust Roy Mitchell?</i>

408
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:53,650
Uh, I'd rode around
in his car.

409
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:56,817
I had dinner with him
at his dinner table.

410
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,358
Um... You know, he was, at one point,
for me, he was like a role model.

411
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:04,025
When I didn't have one,
you know?

412
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,567
We had very few role models
back then.

413
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,108
We had Martin Luther King,
Malcolm X,

414
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:12,817
Muhammad Ali.

415
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,733
<i>I had an FBI agent.</i>

416
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:22,358
You know, I investigated the
Schwerner, Chaney, Goodman murders

417
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:26,025
down in Mississippi in '64.

418
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,442
You familiar?

419
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:30,942
Well...

420
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:33,567
A couple kids was trying

421
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,775
to register Negroes to vote.
That's all they were doing.

422
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:40,942
They got arrested
on bogus speeding charges

423
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:42,817
by the sheriff's deputy,

424
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,400
who hand-delivered them
to the Klan.

425
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:50,900
And they shot 'em, of course.

426
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:54,150
Cut off Chaney's penis.

427
00:25:57,317 --> 00:25:59,108
This,

428
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:01,067
what you and I are doing, is...

429
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,067
What?

430
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,650
Is the other side of that coin.

431
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,067
Don't let Hampton fool you.

432
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,233
The Panthers and the Klan
are one and the same.

433
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:19,900
Their aim is to sow hatred

434
00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:22,233
and inspire terror.

435
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,733
Plain and simple.

436
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:29,275
Now, I'm all for civil rights,

437
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:33,483
but you can't cheat your way
to equality.

438
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:37,025
And you certainly
can't shoot your way to it.

439
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:38,775
Yep.

440
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,317
Anyway, I'm going to go
get those dogs going.

441
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,775
No, no, sit down.
You're a guest.

442
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:58,067
Uh, if you want a taste
of the good stuff,

443
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,275
there's a bottle of scotch
in this bottom cabinet there.

444
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:03,025
You can help yourself.

445
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:05,442
Hey, how much money
you make, man?

446
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:15,567
It's a... It's a living.

447
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,650
So, if I... Say, I get you,
like, some good information.

448
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:20,983
Somethin' nobody else knows.

449
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,775
Is there some kind
of bonus or somethin'?

450
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:28,150
Well, I'm counting on it, Bill.

451
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:33,108
But, to answer your question,
you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

452
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:38,858
Make yourself at home.

453
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:44,983
<i>Did he say when
this meeting's taking place?</i>

454
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:48,650
No, just that Hampton wants
to unify the Black gangs.

455
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:52,275
You know, he'd probably help us
write the darn thing

456
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:54,108
for a couple more bucks.

457
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:56,942
What fun would that be?

458
00:27:57,025 --> 00:28:01,275
I'm pretty sure it's actually
just "dig," not "dig in."

459
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:04,108
What the fuck do you know?

460
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:08,525
I know I've definitely heard
'em say "dig in" before.

461
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:10,233
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

462
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:11,858
Use it in a sentence.

463
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:18,233
Oh. Okay.

464
00:28:18,317 --> 00:28:22,608
These Crowns,
well, they ain't nothin'...

465
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:27,358
but a bunch of jive sissies.

466
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:36,567
Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton of
the Illinois Black Panther Party.

467
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,400
Fred Hampton,

468
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:22,608
the great orator
of the West Side!

469
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,150
Your name's been ringing out,
blood.

470
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:27,192
It's your world, Brother Steel.

471
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,608
Hmm.

472
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:32,733
So, what can I do for you?

473
00:29:32,817 --> 00:29:35,108
Well, I wanna know
what we can do for each other.

474
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:37,483
Y'all was doin' some great work

475
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,442
mobilizing young brothers
on the South Side,

476
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:41,692
and we a part of
a national organization

477
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:44,317
dedicated to the liberation for
oppressed people everywhere.

478
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,442
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whee!

479
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:51,442
This nigga got some
million-dollar words, don't he?

480
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:52,942
They wasn't lyin'.

481
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:57,025
It's not just talk, brother.

482
00:29:57,108 --> 00:29:59,358
Our breakfast program feeds
over 3,000 kids a week.

483
00:29:59,442 --> 00:30:04,525
Motherfucker, the Crowns feed
more babies than General Mills.

484
00:30:04,608 --> 00:30:06,775
Now, who you think employs
all their mommies and daddies?

485
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:08,067
Well, right on, brother,
right on.

486
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,108
But question is,
can you do even more?

487
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:12,358
Hmm?

488
00:30:13,442 --> 00:30:16,608
There's over 5,000 Crowns
in Chicago.

489
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:21,067
Between your manpower and the
Panther's political platform,

490
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,733
we can heal this whole city.

491
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:26,942
And if we take care of Chicago,

492
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:29,108
shit.

493
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,608
Come on, man.

494
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:37,858
You mind if I read you
something, Brother Hampton?

495
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:40,025
Somebody dumped a whole bunch
of these pamphlets

496
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:41,858
on our front yard
the other day,

497
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:45,025
and I just thought they
might be of interest to you.

498
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:48,192
- Do you mind if I...
- Go ahead.

499
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,275
"Word on the street

500
00:30:51,358 --> 00:30:55,650
is that the Crowns got more
rats than a cheese factory.

501
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,233
Where you think
they get all their money from?

502
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:01,733
The pigs run
their whole operation.

503
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:04,775
Well, lemme tell you what,
chump.

504
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:08,442
When you lie with pigs,
you don't just get flies,

505
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,608
you get Panthers,

506
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:12,942
itching

507
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:17,525
to blow your big, Uncle Tom,
watermelon-head off.

508
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,358
Because what's a rat
to a big, black jungle cat?"

509
00:31:23,192 --> 00:31:24,400
Get your ass out here!

510
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,983
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out of here!

511
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:28,483
"When the Panthers are done
with the Crowns..."

512
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,733
Shit.

513
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:34,275
"...they won't have a watermelon-head
left to wear a crown on.

514
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:36,858
Dig in?"

515
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:38,650
"Dig in?"

516
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,942
That you? This your work?

517
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:45,900
- Brother, come on...
- Dick Tracy!

518
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:47,317
I see you traded in
your badge for...

519
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Nigga, you know
not to speak outta turn.

520
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:52,775
It's that motherfucker

521
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:53,900
- that stole Ant's car.
- Shut up!

522
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:55,900
Apologize.

523
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,067
- Sorry.
- Speak up.

524
00:32:01,108 --> 00:32:02,150
Sorry!

525
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:13,858
If that was us murder mouthin',
where our guns at, huh?

526
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:16,483
We came to y'all headquarters
unarmed.

527
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:21,400
So, who do you think
wrote it, then?

528
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:22,608
The pigs, who else?

529
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,733
The pigs don't write, blood.

530
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:27,483
The Feds do.

531
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,442
They pulled the same shit
on Martin and Malcolm.

532
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:32,525
Mm-hmm.

533
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:33,942
And what happened to them?

534
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:35,692
Same shit that's gonna happen
to all of us.

535
00:32:37,317 --> 00:32:39,067
At least they died
for the people.

536
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,858
We should be so lucky.

537
00:33:08,983 --> 00:33:10,317
You gonna need this.

538
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:15,108
Tread lightly, blood.

539
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:43,067
Hey, Chairman. Chairman.
Let me take that off your hands.

540
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,858
Maybe the Disciples
will be more receptive.

541
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:52,692
You can bet the Disciples got
one of them Fed letters, too.

542
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:54,358
The pigs got ahead of us.

543
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:11,025
Ah. So, what,
you ridin' with me?

544
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:12,983
You got your piece on you,
comrade?

545
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,317
Yeah, it's in the glove box.

546
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:18,900
Why? What's up?

547
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:25,817
Come on, Judy.
You know what...

548
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:49,942
What was all that shit
about a badge?

549
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:52,442
Badge?

550
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:53,942
Man, what the fuck is your...
Ow!

551
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,108
All right, all right,
all right!

552
00:34:56,192 --> 00:34:58,275
Calm down! Calm the fuck down!

553
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:01,567
Can I talk to her?
Can I talk to her?

554
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,608
All right.

555
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,275
Y'all ain't gonna believe me, all right?
But I used to...

556
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,692
I used to pretend I was a Fed
back when I used to boost cars...

557
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:15,400
- Shh.
- When I used to boost cars.

558
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:17,650
What kinda fucking sense
does that make?

559
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,650
A pig boosting cars.

560
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:23,275
Now, what I would do is I would pretend.
I show 'em a fake badge, right?

561
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:25,650
And then I say
your car is reported stolen.

562
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:28,900
And then I'd hop in it,
and I'd just ride. Just go.

563
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:30,317
Before anybody
knew the difference,

564
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,775
I was in the wind,
dig what I'm sayin'?

565
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:33,525
You would be surprised
what they believe.

566
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:35,733
You put on one of them coats
and the Humphrey Bogart hat...

567
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:37,192
You steal this car?

568
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:39,692
Yeah, no. Yeah, from a pimp.

569
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:41,775
And a pimp believed
you were a Fed?

570
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:43,983
Okay, so, I...

571
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:45,650
What kinda amateur-hour macks
you be knowin' out here, man?

572
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:47,483
I hot-wired this shit,
all right?

573
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:49,692
All right?

574
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:53,733
- Do it again.
- What?

575
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:55,650
You say
you hot-wired this shit,

576
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:57,567
so do it again.

577
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,608
Okay, look, look, uh...

578
00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:02,233
I ain't got no goddamn tools on me
right now to do it right this second.

579
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:03,983
Comrade, reach in my boot.

580
00:36:05,108 --> 00:36:07,192
Oh, come on now, y'all.

581
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,442
All right,
give me the motherfucker, man.

582
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:15,692
Shit.

583
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,442
All right, give me a second.
Give me a second.

584
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:37,233
Shit.

585
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:42,483
Come on, come on,
come on...

586
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:45,650
Come on, baby.

587
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,983
Are you happy?

588
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:55,233
How did you get keys
to a hot car?

589
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,608
Now, you think in your mind,
I'm gonna pick up a stone fox

590
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:04,358
in this bad motherfucker
right here,

591
00:37:04,442 --> 00:37:06,733
and start it up with a goddamn
screwdriver in the ignition?

592
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:10,567
I had my boy replace the lock,
motherfucker. Come on, man.

593
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:16,233
God dawg, man.

594
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,317
Can you get
that motherfucker off me now?

595
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:21,358
Shit.

596
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,067
Wild Bill.

597
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,317
<i>They don't
attack me because I'm a Muslim.</i>

598
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,567
<i>They attack me
'cause I'm Black.</i>

599
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,025
<i>They attacked all of us
for the same reason.</i>

600
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:35,150
<i>All of us catch hell
from the same enemy.</i>

601
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,942
- <i>We're all in the same bag...</i>
- In the same bag.

602
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:39,442
- <i>...in the same boat.</i>
- In the same boat.

603
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:40,692
<i>We suffer
political oppression...</i>

604
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,442
We suffer
political oppression,

605
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:44,483
- <i>...economic exploitation...</i>
- Economic exploitation.

606
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,983
- <i>...and social degradation.</i>
- And social degradation.

607
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,108
<i>All of 'em from the same enemy.</i>

608
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:49,775
All of 'em from the same enemy.

609
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:51,442
- <i>The government has failed us.</i>
- The government has failed us.

610
00:37:51,525 --> 00:37:53,150
- <i>You can't deny that.</i>
- You can't deny that.

611
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:56,650
<i>Any time you're living
in the 20th century, 1964,</i>

612
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,608
<i>and you walking around here
singing "We Shall Overcome,"</i>

613
00:37:59,692 --> 00:38:01,358
- <i>the government has failed you.</i>
- The government has failed you.

614
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:04,817
Keep going.

615
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,525
Mm-mm.

616
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:13,775
Well, do you know his speech
<i>The Black Revolution?</i>

617
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,400
"Sometimes,
when a person's house is on fire...

618
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:35,983
...and the person to whom the
house belongs to is asleep...

619
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:40,983
...if someone comes in
yelling 'fire, '

620
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:45,025
instead of the person to whom the
house belongs to being thankful...

621
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:48,942
...they make the mistake of
charging the one who awakened them

622
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:50,692
with having set the fire.

623
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,650
- I hope that..."
- "I hope that

624
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:57,650
this little conversation tonight
about the Black Revolution

625
00:38:57,733 --> 00:38:59,692
won't cause many of you

626
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:03,650
- to accuse us of igniting it..."
- "Igniting it..."

627
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:05,733
"...when you find it
at your doorstep."

628
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:07,317
Well, you gotta do the voice.

629
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,733
"When you find it at your
doorstep."

630
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:09,900
Mm-hmm.

631
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:13,067
I listen to him every morning.

632
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,192
I feel like he never lets folks
put words in his mouth,

633
00:39:16,275 --> 00:39:19,733
and no matter what,
he doesn't get flustered or angry.

634
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,525
I'd like to be like that
someday.

635
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
Right on.

636
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:26,900
Right on.

637
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,608
Anyway, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

638
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:43,650
You want some coffee?

639
00:39:46,942 --> 00:39:47,900
Sure.

640
00:39:49,942 --> 00:39:51,150
How you take it?

641
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:54,275
Black, and sweet.

642
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:37,108
What?

643
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:41,025
I did not expect you to be shy.

644
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:43,358
Oh, I'm not shy.

645
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,108
Okay.

646
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,983
We ain't talkin' about some
hippies playing bongos in the park.

647
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,025
These the same motherfuckers
hit Dr. King with a brick.

648
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:32,233
I don't know how I feel about
goin' up in there without my pistol.

649
00:41:33,442 --> 00:41:34,442
Right on.

650
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:38,233
Best you stay behind, then.

651
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,067
<i>Displace maybe two,
three times as many of us.</i>

652
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,192
Well, they might think it's easy
to throw out the white trash,

653
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:56,317
but they better
fuckin' burn it!

654
00:41:58,233 --> 00:41:59,275
Whoo.

655
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,567
You're Fred Hampton.

656
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,900
You must be the Preacherman.

657
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:13,317
Well, I'm a fan
of y'all's paper.

658
00:42:14,025 --> 00:42:15,608
Funnies, especially.

659
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:20,567
That flag is
some motherfuckin' bullshit.

660
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,067
Comrade.

661
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,650
Take it easy, comrade.

662
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:25,608
It's just up there to remind us
of our Southern heritage.

663
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:29,067
When I look at that,
I don't see no flag hanging.

664
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,358
I see my uncle
hanging from a tree.

665
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:33,858
And a bunch of white devils like
y'all smiling around his body.

666
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,483
Who the fuck
you think you're talkin' to?

667
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:36,858
Hey, cool it, cool it!

668
00:42:36,942 --> 00:42:39,442
- You're in our house.
- Hey, cool it!

669
00:42:39,525 --> 00:42:42,067
Look, we oppressed your people
for a long time...

670
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,817
I didn't oppress shit.
And my folks grew up poor.

671
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,275
They were sharecroppers.

672
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:49,317
AKA the overseer.

673
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,358
What if the overseer
had banded with the slaves

674
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:52,858
and cut the master's throat?

675
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,192
What then, comrade?

676
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:03,567
We might not be in this
funky-ass ghetto right now.

677
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,775
I'm not talking about the
West Side or the South Side.

678
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:08,483
I'm talkin' this filthy-ass
motherfucker right here.

679
00:43:09,317 --> 00:43:10,900
Shit.

680
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:13,483
We almost got into it with
a rat over a parking space.

681
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:19,442
I bet y'all babies gettin'
the same bullshit education.

682
00:43:20,858 --> 00:43:22,442
Y'all payin' the same taxes

683
00:43:22,525 --> 00:43:25,400
to get your heads whooped in
by the same motherfuckin' pigs.

684
00:43:26,692 --> 00:43:28,025
Ain't that a trip?

685
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:30,317
We pay them, huh?

686
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,567
We pay the pigs
to run us off of our corners.

687
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:36,858
Let me ask y'all somethin'.

688
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:41,942
If this building caught fire right
now, what would y'all worry about?

689
00:43:43,025 --> 00:43:45,275
Water and escape.

690
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:46,775
If somebody were to ask you,

691
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:48,108
"What's your culture
during this fire, brother?"

692
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,525
"Water, that's my culture."

693
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:53,483
"Well, how about your
politics?" "Water and escape."

694
00:43:55,817 --> 00:44:00,900
<i>Well, guess what,
America is on fire right now,</i>

695
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:04,067
<i>and until that fire
is extinguished,</i>

696
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,483
<i>don't nothin' else
mean a goddamn thing.</i>

697
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:23,400
So, rednecks
and Puerto Ricans.

698
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:26,150
In Chicago.

699
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:32,358
That motherfucker Fred,
he could sell salt to a slug.

700
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:36,983
Nice work, Bill.

701
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:40,567
Chicago's the most
segregated city in America!

702
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,692
Not Shreveport!

703
00:44:42,775 --> 00:44:44,275
Not Birmingham!

704
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,525
But we here to change that.

705
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:52,775
The Black Panthers, the Young
Lords, and the Young Patriots

706
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:55,817
are forming a Rainbow Coalition

707
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,317
of oppressed brothers and
sisters of every color!

708
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,525
Cha Cha, tell 'em
why we gathered here today.

709
00:45:04,442 --> 00:45:05,692
Last week,

710
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:10,525
our brother, Manuel Ramos,

711
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:13,692
was shot in the head
and killed by an off-duty pig.

712
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:21,233
So, we caught the pig and turned
him over to his fellow pigs.

713
00:45:23,858 --> 00:45:25,983
And for some reason,

714
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:27,942
we expected justice.

715
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:34,817
Well, let's see what they do,
now that we're in front of the pigpen,

716
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,775
and we demand
an independent investigation!

717
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,400
No more pigs
in our community!

718
00:45:41,483 --> 00:45:42,692
Off the pigs!

719
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:44,317
No more pigs
in our community!

720
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,400
Off the pigs!

721
00:45:45,483 --> 00:45:47,108
No more pigs in our community!

722
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:48,317
Off the pigs!

723
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,817
No more pigs
in our community!

724
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,067
Off the pigs!

725
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,150
No more pigs
in our community!

726
00:45:53,275 --> 00:45:54,900
Uh, your feet cold.

727
00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:57,358
Why your feet so cold?

728
00:45:57,442 --> 00:46:00,150
No!
Get 'em off of me!

729
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:01,442
My feet cold, your feet cold.

730
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,067
No, unless you...
They're like...

731
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,150
But that's socialism, man.

732
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:08,108
Well, you gotta warm 'em up,
though.

733
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,775
Well, how you think
Mao did the Long March, huh?

734
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:14,192
The Chinese would warm
these feet left and right.

735
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:16,275
You saying
I'm a foot capitalist?

736
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:19,150
You really gonna call me
a foot capitalist, Chairman?

737
00:46:20,483 --> 00:46:23,025
<i>So, summer of '69,</i>

738
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:25,650
the Rainbow Coalition
is in full swing.

739
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:29,317
Fred's influence is growing.
What happens next?

740
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,275
I want him off the street.

741
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:32,942
Charge him with something.
Anything.

742
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:35,817
But get his Black ass
off the street.

743
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,817
Y'all don't see there's
kids in here? Huh?

744
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,358
Of course, you're gonna wait till
you get to a free breakfast program

745
00:46:39,442 --> 00:46:40,608
to pull somethin' like this!

746
00:46:40,692 --> 00:46:42,483
- Bunch of cowards!
- Deborah...

747
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:43,692
- Tighten up.
- You disgust...

748
00:46:43,775 --> 00:46:45,317
- Come on, now.
- You disgust me!

749
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,317
Show some discipline.
Tell Rush to get me a lawyer.

750
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,817
<i>What was he arrested for?</i>

751
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,775
Don't worry, y'all,
I'll be right back.

752
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:52,983
<i>Ice cream.</i>

753
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:58,817
Yeah, he was accused of taking

754
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,192
70-something dollars' worth
of ice cream.

755
00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:07,150
<i>And I think he got two to five for
that, if I'm not mistaken.</i>

756
00:47:07,233 --> 00:47:11,025
<i>And how did Fred
going to prison affect the party?</i>

757
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:14,275
<i>How didn't it? You know,
membership decreased.</i>

758
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:18,233
<i>Donations started dwindling.</i>

759
00:47:18,317 --> 00:47:20,775
<i>Because I was so good
at installing alarms,</i>

760
00:47:20,858 --> 00:47:23,400
<i>you know, buzzers
and things like that,</i>

761
00:47:23,483 --> 00:47:26,442
<i>Rush decided to promote me
to security captain.</i>

762
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:32,525
Whoa!

763
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:34,775
Damn it, man!
What the fuck are you doin'?

764
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:35,942
We got a visitor.

765
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:37,817
Brother on the run
from the pigs.

766
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,067
Can't be too careful.

767
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,733
All right, all right,
God damn it.

768
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:42,233
Put that shit down.

769
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:45,150
Shit, man.

770
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:46,817
Got to watch that shit, man.

771
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:50,733
Who's that?

772
00:47:50,817 --> 00:47:53,358
Security Captain Bill O'Neal,
motherfucker. Who are you?

773
00:47:53,442 --> 00:47:54,858
I'm George Sams.

774
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:57,692
Security captain
for the New Haven chapter.

775
00:47:57,775 --> 00:47:58,775
Pardon the paranoia.

776
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:00,525
Hey, we got a rat, man.

777
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:02,192
What?

778
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:03,483
They smoked one out.

779
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:05,317
- In New Haven.
- How? How?

780
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,400
They put a squeeze on that
motherfucker, that's how, nigga.

781
00:48:08,483 --> 00:48:10,025
Now, I didn't say that.

782
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,483
I said the brother
got some discipline

783
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,942
in the area of the nose
and the mouth.

784
00:48:17,817 --> 00:48:21,233
And then, the brother started to
show some cowardly tendencies, so,

785
00:48:21,317 --> 00:48:25,442
boiled some water, gave him
a little more discipline.

786
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,442
We held a trial first.

787
00:48:29,525 --> 00:48:32,275
Well, shit, where he at now?

788
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:35,942
He's at the bottom of the
river with the rest of the trash.

789
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:44,358
Shit, nigga,
what you think he did?

790
00:48:44,442 --> 00:48:46,608
Shit, I would have killed
that motherfucker, too.

791
00:48:46,692 --> 00:48:49,025
Killed him dead. I'd have beat
the shit out that nigga, too,

792
00:48:49,108 --> 00:48:50,608
before I...

793
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:52,525
I would have shot that nigga,
stabbed his ass, or...

794
00:48:52,608 --> 00:48:55,525
Man, y'all lucky I wasn't there.
I would...

795
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,775
Boy...

796
00:48:57,858 --> 00:48:59,275
Motherfucker, please.

797
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:00,608
All right, player,
all right, all right.

798
00:49:00,692 --> 00:49:02,233
Bitch motherfucker.

799
00:49:16,192 --> 00:49:18,608
- Does anybody else know about me?
- No.

800
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:19,608
- Huh?
- No.

801
00:49:19,692 --> 00:49:20,567
From the Bureau?

802
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,942
No. No, my superiors know

803
00:49:23,025 --> 00:49:24,608
- I have a man on the inside, but...
- Huh?

804
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,483
My superiors know I have a man
on the inside, but that's it.

805
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:32,067
No one knows your identity.

806
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,483
Are you sure?

807
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:36,775
I swear on my kids, okay?

808
00:49:37,733 --> 00:49:39,733
What has got you all spooked?

809
00:49:39,817 --> 00:49:41,567
Oh, man, it...

810
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,733
Okay, this Panther from New Haven
came down, you know, and, uh...

811
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,567
And he talkin'
about they caught an informant,

812
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:51,067
and they tortured him,
and they killed him, Roy, all right?

813
00:49:52,775 --> 00:49:54,317
Who did?

814
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,775
His name is George Sams.

815
00:49:56,858 --> 00:49:58,775
George Sams.

816
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:02,358
And who's the fella
they killed, this informant?

817
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:04,192
His name is Alex Rackley.

818
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:07,067
It's a guy outta New York.
I don't know, I ain't never met him.

819
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,317
But, shit, Roy...

820
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,025
Where is Sams hiding now?

821
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:12,442
He's hidin'
at the office for now.

822
00:50:12,525 --> 00:50:16,692
He say he's gonna skip town
and, you know, get outta here.

823
00:50:18,192 --> 00:50:21,650
Okay. I need you to draw up
a floor plan of the office.

824
00:50:21,733 --> 00:50:24,567
With this intel,
I can get authorization for a raid.

825
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,108
What?

826
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:28,192
- Don't worry, Bill.
- What the fuck are you talking...

827
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,025
I will give you a heads-up,
so you can make yourself scarce, okay?

828
00:50:30,108 --> 00:50:32,067
Roy, are you fuckin'
listenin' to me right now?

829
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:34,983
They poured boiling water all over
this motherfucker, you hear me?

830
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:37,233
Yes, I understand.
I'm not surprised.

831
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:40,025
What did I tell you?
No different from the Klan.

832
00:50:40,108 --> 00:50:41,192
Now you see.

833
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:49,442
Look, now, y'all gonna have to come
up off some serious fuckin' dough

834
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:50,983
for this, all right?

835
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:58,233
I will make sure
you're properly compensated.

836
00:50:58,317 --> 00:50:59,900
<i>Discipline
in the area of the nose...</i>

837
00:50:59,983 --> 00:51:01,067
Yeah?

838
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,400
Sir.

839
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:07,192
A Panther on the run from Connecticut
is hiding out here in Chicago.

840
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:11,858
Says he was part of a group
that killed another Panther.

841
00:51:11,942 --> 00:51:13,067
An informant.

842
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,650
George Sams.

843
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:16,775
Warrant's being written up
as we speak.

844
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:18,942
We're going in on Wednesday.

845
00:51:19,817 --> 00:51:21,150
How'd you know?

846
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:24,692
Sams is one of our guys.
Warrant's just a pretense.

847
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,733
So, Sams is the informant?

848
00:51:28,817 --> 00:51:30,108
Mm-hmm.

849
00:51:30,192 --> 00:51:33,942
So, he didn't really kill,
uh...

850
00:51:36,442 --> 00:51:37,608
Alex Rackley?

851
00:51:37,692 --> 00:51:40,442
No, he did.

852
00:51:40,525 --> 00:51:43,108
Well, he claims two other guys
were the triggermen,

853
00:51:43,192 --> 00:51:44,983
but what's he gonna say?

854
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:50,442
Forgive me, I'm confused.

855
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:56,400
So, this kid, Alex Rackley,

856
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,692
was labelled an informant
and then killed...

857
00:51:58,775 --> 00:51:59,775
Mm-hmm.

858
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:02,525
...by an actual FBI informant.

859
00:52:04,942 --> 00:52:07,275
And we're just letting him
walk for murder?

860
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:09,150
It's beautiful.

861
00:52:09,275 --> 00:52:11,525
He's on the lam, right?

862
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:14,817
So, any time he goes
into a Panther office,

863
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,817
we get a warrant
for harboring a fugitive.

864
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,817
He's in the interview room
right now with our liaison guys,

865
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,442
planning the next stop
on his little tour.

866
00:52:26,983 --> 00:52:29,692
Wow. That's, uh...

867
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:35,733
<i>Takes a thief
to catch a thief, Roy.</i>

868
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:37,150
We got a snitch.

869
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:40,817
What the fuck
is you talkin' about?

870
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,567
How the fuck did the
pigs know Sams was even here?

871
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,650
Y'all ever think about that?
Huh?

872
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:47,150
That motherfucker
run his mouth so much,

873
00:52:47,233 --> 00:52:48,608
he probably outed
his damn self.

874
00:52:48,692 --> 00:52:50,650
No, nigga. Because they took
the donor rolls,

875
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:52,858
and they left
all these goddamn binders here.

876
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:54,108
You understand
what I'm saying?

877
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:55,567
They went straight
for the safe.

878
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,192
Then, they went straight
into the weapons cabinet,

879
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,275
which is right
in the fuckin' slop closet.

880
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:00,817
It's like they knew
where everything was.

881
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,692
- Hey, smarten up, brother.
- What?

882
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:04,317
You're fallin'
right into the pigs' trap.

883
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,817
What the fuck
are you talkin' about, man?

884
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,483
You know, Jimmy,
maybe you a goddamn pig.

885
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:10,067
- You ever think about that?
- What? Man, fuck you, nigga!

886
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,442
Hey! Hey! Hey! Cool it!

887
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:14,692
You ever do that shit
again, motherfucker...

888
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,358
Both of y'all,
show some discipline!

889
00:53:17,442 --> 00:53:19,692
- Are you okay?
- There's a goddamn rat in here, Bobby!

890
00:53:19,775 --> 00:53:21,858
And when I find him,
I'm gonna smoke him out.

891
00:53:21,942 --> 00:53:23,775
You motherfuckers hear me?
I'm gonna smoke him out.

892
00:53:23,858 --> 00:53:25,733
You thought New Haven was bad?

893
00:53:25,817 --> 00:53:27,067
You keep fuckin' with me!

894
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:27,942
- You keep fuckin' with me!
- Cool it!

895
00:53:28,025 --> 00:53:29,067
Cool it, O'Neal!

896
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,775
God damn it!

897
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,275
<i>Dear Comrade Deborah,</i>

898
00:54:01,317 --> 00:54:03,150
<i>I dreamt of you
the other night,</i>

899
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:06,275
<i>and for a second,
I thought I was home.</i>

900
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,400
<i>Pardon the delay
in writing you. I am...</i>

901
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:10,650
CO!

902
00:54:10,733 --> 00:54:13,567
- <i>It was not by choice.</i>
- CO!

903
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,858
<i>The pigs do everything in their
power to keep us isolated.</i>

904
00:54:18,942 --> 00:54:21,150
<i>Because they know,
the day we get organized,</i>

905
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:24,650
<i>it's over for their asses.</i>

906
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:30,317
<i>Not having books, I find myself
playing old speeches in my head,</i>

907
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,983
<i>and I keep comin' back
to this line from Dr. King...</i>

908
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:37,608
<i>"Let us not wallow
in the valley of despair,"</i>

909
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,817
<i>because make no mistake,
comrade,</i>

910
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:42,817
<i>this is the fuckin' valley.</i>

911
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:46,108
<i>But where some see despair,</i>

912
00:54:46,192 --> 00:54:49,567
<i>I see ground zero
for the revolution.</i>

913
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,983
<i>Two thousand brothers
who know who the enemy is.</i>

914
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:55,692
<i>Who don't need the
contradiction to be heightened.</i>

915
00:54:55,775 --> 00:54:57,317
<i>Because in Menard,</i>

916
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,358
<i>the contradictions don't get
more black and white.</i>

917
00:55:02,067 --> 00:55:05,733
<i>I mean, a lot of these brothers
came here politicized, too.</i>

918
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:07,608
<i>They just need organizing.</i>

919
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,650
<i>By the time I'm through,</i>

920
00:55:10,733 --> 00:55:12,317
<i>I might fuck around and
have the pigs reading Fanon.</i>

921
00:55:18,567 --> 00:55:20,900
<i>I have so many questions
about how you doing,</i>

922
00:55:20,983 --> 00:55:22,858
<i>about how the party's doing.</i>

923
00:55:22,942 --> 00:55:26,650
<i>But ain't no way you're gettin'
a kite to me in this hellhole.</i>

924
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:29,650
<i>God forbid, one of the party
members gets sent over,</i>

925
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:32,900
<i>they could let me know
how y'all are farin'.</i>

926
00:55:32,983 --> 00:55:35,567
<i>But I'd rather be
left in the dark.</i>

927
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:38,150
<i>The last thing I want
is y'all up in here with me,</i>

928
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:40,067
<i>or worse.</i>

929
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:44,817
<i>Tell the comrades
to be careful.</i>

930
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,358
<i>Especially when they out
patrollin' the pigs.</i>

931
00:55:48,442 --> 00:55:51,692
<i>A brother who just got in here told
me they been vampin' extra heavy</i>

932
00:55:51,775 --> 00:55:53,442
<i>since the summer started.</i>

933
00:55:55,483 --> 00:55:58,192
<i>Y'all stay safe.</i>

934
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:03,525
<i>In revolutionary love,
Chairman Fred.</i>

935
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:08,400
Officers! Now, what crime
have these brothers perpetrated?

936
00:56:08,483 --> 00:56:11,025
Get the fuck outta here.

937
00:56:11,108 --> 00:56:12,608
No, see, I live here.

938
00:56:12,692 --> 00:56:14,775
Now, y'all get the fuck
up outta here.

939
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,817
Shit.

940
00:56:34,025 --> 00:56:35,567
- Jake.
- Hey, Reg.

941
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,733
The fuck you doin' up in here?

942
00:56:37,817 --> 00:56:40,817
I sure as shit know a squirrel
like you ain't got the clap.

943
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,275
Nah, man. My comrade, Palmer,
got shot by the pigs.

944
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:45,900
I'm lookin' in on him.

945
00:56:45,983 --> 00:56:48,317
All right, brother. Be careful.

946
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:54,858
No visitors allowed.

947
00:56:54,942 --> 00:56:57,442
Yeah, but the nurse told me
visiting hours are till 10:00 p.m.

948
00:56:57,525 --> 00:56:59,608
Not for your pal here.

949
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,692
Can I at least
leave him the books?

950
00:57:02,775 --> 00:57:03,983
You may not.

951
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,025
"If we must die,
let us not be like hogs."

952
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:19,317
Come on.

953
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,817
"Hunted and penned
in an inglorious spot."

954
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,317
Do us both a favor
and get lost.

955
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,025
"While around us
bark the mad and hungry dogs,

956
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,025
- making their mock at..."
- Winters?

957
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:28,608
Jimmy! Hey,
how you holdin' up, man?

958
00:57:28,692 --> 00:57:30,942
You got five seconds
to fuck off.

959
00:57:31,025 --> 00:57:33,692
- One. Two. Three.
- Shit.

960
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:34,942
All right, that's it.

961
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:37,025
All right.

962
00:57:41,275 --> 00:57:43,358
Hey, I'mma get with you, Jimmy.

963
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:48,775
<i>Hey, Williams,
is that Harriet Tubman?</i>

964
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,150
You made it out. You're good.

965
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:52,650
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
It's Aunt Jemima.</i>

966
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:54,483
<i>I love the pancakes, miss.</i>

967
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,650
What's up, guys?

968
00:57:57,733 --> 00:57:59,733
<i>I just want
you all to know</i>

969
00:57:59,817 --> 00:58:01,858
<i>you can thank
the Black Panther Party</i>

970
00:58:01,942 --> 00:58:06,817
<i>for the increased police
presence in your neighborhood.</i>

971
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,983
<i>A glorious group
of cop-killers.</i>

972
00:58:10,067 --> 00:58:12,317
<i>I'm about to fuckin' move
in over here.</i>

973
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,817
<i>I'm about to get my fuckin'
couch, a fuckin' television set.</i>

974
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,483
- Is the back clear?
- Clear.

975
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:19,233
- You got a whistle?
- <i>Fuck it, bring the kids.</i>

976
00:58:19,317 --> 00:58:21,192
Escort Comrade Deborah
out the back to the safe house.

977
00:58:21,275 --> 00:58:22,358
What? Why?

978
00:58:22,442 --> 00:58:23,817
I'll take Deborah.
Come on, babe.

979
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,192
You don't even know
where it is.

980
00:58:25,275 --> 00:58:27,317
I ain't goin' nowhere.

981
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,233
<i>I don't know about you, but I believe
they wake up at fucking 7:00 a.m.</i>

982
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,067
I can protect myself.

983
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,858
I know you can.

984
00:58:36,942 --> 00:58:39,567
But you don't got just yourself
to think about anymore.

985
00:58:41,442 --> 00:58:45,025
I didn't wanna have to say it
like this, but I...

986
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:47,358
I recognize
what you're going through,

987
00:58:47,442 --> 00:58:50,858
with the chairman being locked
up and everything, and I just...

988
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:54,692
Does he know?

989
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,275
Deb, I...

990
00:59:10,192 --> 00:59:11,900
Now, Judy,
you know this ain't nothin'

991
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:13,817
but a couple of drunk-ass pigs.

992
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,400
They probably gonna leave here,
go get some donuts or some shit.

993
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:18,108
Maybe.

994
00:59:18,192 --> 00:59:19,358
I'll tell you what they
definitely not gonna do, though,

995
00:59:19,442 --> 00:59:20,650
and that's come up in here.

996
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:22,067
Not again.
White, you guard the rear.

997
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,775
<i>Hey, Panthers!</i>

998
00:59:23,858 --> 00:59:25,775
<i>If you really give a fuck
about these people out here,</i>

999
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:27,400
<i>you'll come down.</i>

1000
00:59:27,483 --> 00:59:29,900
<i>You little motherfuckers think
it's cool to shoot a cop?</i>

1001
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,317
Make sure she gets home safe.

1002
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,858
<i>Today's the day.</i>

1003
00:59:34,067 --> 00:59:36,483
<i>Today's the fuckin' day!</i>

1004
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:39,442
<i>Either you fucks come down
or we're comin' up!</i>

1005
00:59:39,525 --> 00:59:40,733
<i>Gun!</i>

1006
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:49,150
10-1, we need backup.
Black Panther headquarters.

1007
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:51,358
Hey, kid,
clear the fuckin' sidewalks!

1008
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:53,108
Move! Kid! Kid!

1009
00:59:53,192 --> 00:59:54,442
Who's got the room?

1010
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:55,608
Get off the fuckin' sidewalk!

1011
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,442
I got the shooter!

1012
00:59:57,525 --> 00:59:59,317
- What the fuck you doin'?
- I'mma cover you from the roof.

1013
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,942
- O'Neal, where are you going?
- Trust me,

1014
01:00:01,025 --> 01:00:02,817
it'll make better sense
when they call for backup,

1015
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,733
and they're goin'
to call for backup.

1016
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,317
- Hey.
- What's up?

1017
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,775
I'mma go secure the roof,
all right?

1018
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:16,442
- Right on.
- All right.

1019
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:17,608
Fuck.

1020
01:00:23,692 --> 01:00:24,775
Fuck.

1021
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:26,692
Watch your backs!

1022
01:00:26,775 --> 01:00:27,817
Look at that window!

1023
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,650
Hold your positions!

1024
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:31,108
Do you guys see any
other weapons besides those?

1025
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:32,192
Is there any visuals?

1026
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,525
Sniper!

1027
01:00:37,608 --> 01:00:38,692
God...

1028
01:01:17,025 --> 01:01:19,233
I hate you! You swine!

1029
01:01:19,317 --> 01:01:20,525
Keep 'em back!

1030
01:01:29,025 --> 01:01:30,692
White! You okay?

1031
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:38,692
Fuck, I'm out!

1032
01:01:44,942 --> 01:01:46,192
Stop shootin'!
We comin' out!

1033
01:01:46,275 --> 01:01:47,400
Comin' out!

1034
01:01:47,483 --> 01:01:49,775
We're comin' out!
We're comin' out!

1035
01:01:49,858 --> 01:01:53,108
<i>Cease fire! Cease fire!</i>

1036
01:01:53,192 --> 01:01:56,233
<i>God damn it!
God damn it, cease fire!</i>

1037
01:01:58,483 --> 01:02:00,775
<i>Come out with your hands up!</i>

1038
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:10,233
Comin' out!
We're comin' out! Don't shoot!

1039
01:02:10,317 --> 01:02:12,400
<i>Cease fire!
Cease fire!</i>

1040
01:02:12,483 --> 01:02:13,983
Drop your weapon!

1041
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:16,025
- Move in! Move in!
- Motherfucker!

1042
01:02:20,858 --> 01:02:22,067
- No!
- Let her go!

1043
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:23,275
That's a woman, man!

1044
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:24,358
What the fuck happened?

1045
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:26,067
What you doing?

1046
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,567
Get 'em in the fuckin' wagon!

1047
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,358
Get in the building.
I need to blow the building!

1048
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:32,942
I need explosives
inside the building!

1049
01:02:33,025 --> 01:02:35,525
Keep 'em back! Keep 'em back!

1050
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,900
Let 'em go! Let 'em go!

1051
01:02:44,983 --> 01:02:47,442
They're gonna burn it down.
They're gonna burn it down!

1052
01:02:47,525 --> 01:02:50,650
No! Get off of me! No!

1053
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:57,858
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1054
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,317
It's over.

1055
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:02,608
Mitchell.

1056
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:04,150
<i>Hey, listen,
I'm out, Roy. I'm out!</i>

1057
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:06,442
Calm down. Calm down, Bill.

1058
01:04:06,525 --> 01:04:08,733
<i>Don't you tell me to fuckin' calm
down, all right?</i>

1059
01:04:08,817 --> 01:04:10,400
I was almost killed, man!

1060
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:13,692
Now, Fred's in jail,
I did the damn job, and I'm out!

1061
01:04:13,775 --> 01:04:15,442
<i>No, that's not how it works.</i>

1062
01:04:15,525 --> 01:04:17,275
What the fuck do you mean,
"That's not how it works"?

1063
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:18,983
<i>Why don't you give me
one good reason</i>

1064
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:20,400
<i>why I don't just book it
outta here right now?</i>

1065
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:22,025
Because...

1066
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,233
Because, as I've mentioned,

1067
01:04:24,317 --> 01:04:26,358
it's a year and a half
for the stolen car,

1068
01:04:26,442 --> 01:04:29,192
and five years for
impersonating a federal officer.

1069
01:04:29,275 --> 01:04:32,900
<i>And if you run, I will hunt you
down, you understand...</i>

1070
01:04:32,983 --> 01:04:34,942
Man, shut the fuck up!

1071
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:40,900
Fuck!

1072
01:04:40,983 --> 01:04:43,150
- <i>What do we need?</i>
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

1073
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:45,108
You the handyman.
Oakland says rebuild immediately.

1074
01:04:45,192 --> 01:04:46,817
What do we need?

1075
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,692
We need a goddamn white flag, Bobby!
You don't see this shit?

1076
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:52,567
- Don't you understand this shit is...
- God damn!

1077
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,567
They burnt the shit
out this motherfucker.

1078
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:55,733
You're goddamn right,
they did.

1079
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:57,150
Watch your mouth, man!

1080
01:04:58,358 --> 01:05:00,025
Y'all need help?

1081
01:05:01,025 --> 01:05:02,775
Yeah, little brother.

1082
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:06,233
Um, go on down to the store and
get us a couple of trash cans.

1083
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:11,733
That's how you rebuild,
comrade.

1084
01:05:18,608 --> 01:05:21,775
Hey! Hey! Can I help y'all?

1085
01:05:21,858 --> 01:05:23,608
We came to ask y'all that.

1086
01:05:23,692 --> 01:05:25,150
Got some bodies
if you need 'em.

1087
01:05:25,233 --> 01:05:28,025
Look, I know y'all got an army
and all that,

1088
01:05:28,108 --> 01:05:30,108
but figured y'all could use
some reserves.

1089
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:34,275
Oh, right on.

1090
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:35,900
Y'all know how to use
a tape measure?

1091
01:05:35,983 --> 01:05:37,942
'Cause this needs measurin'
right here, all right?

1092
01:05:38,025 --> 01:05:39,483
And then that drywall
right there

1093
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:41,442
needs to be measured out
and flushed,

1094
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:43,108
you know, how I got it here.

1095
01:05:43,192 --> 01:05:45,108
And the rest of y'all can grab
some of these paint rollers,

1096
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:47,025
and help 'em with that wall.

1097
01:05:47,108 --> 01:05:49,067
Yeah, right there is good.

1098
01:05:54,858 --> 01:05:59,650
Los Angeles leaders
Bunchy Carter and John Huggins.

1099
01:06:01,067 --> 01:06:03,983
Well, former leaders.

1100
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,983
Chalk marks, all that's left.

1101
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,983
Our friend, Mr. Cleaver...

1102
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:14,817
On the lam in Algeria.

1103
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,358
A gift from our friends
at Langley.

1104
01:06:17,442 --> 01:06:19,150
- Hmm.
- Oh.

1105
01:06:19,233 --> 01:06:23,025
Look who's here.
Our old friend, Bobby Seale.

1106
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:25,733
You recognize this from the evening
news, all bundled up.

1107
01:06:25,817 --> 01:06:29,317
It must be very cold
in that Chicago courtroom.

1108
01:06:30,858 --> 01:06:32,817
Speaking of Seale,

1109
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,567
if the Seale verdict
does not fall our way,

1110
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:39,858
we have a witness who'll testify
he ordered a hit in Connecticut.

1111
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:43,650
I believe you're familiar with George
Sams, Agent Mitchell?

1112
01:06:47,525 --> 01:06:49,317
Yes, sir.

1113
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,733
Very well.
Have a seat, gentlemen.

1114
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:08,775
How are the boys,
Jack and Tyler?

1115
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,358
Good, sir.

1116
01:07:14,733 --> 01:07:16,192
Thank you. Uh...

1117
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,525
Tyler just started
Little League.

1118
01:07:20,608 --> 01:07:23,233
Kid's got quite an arm on him.

1119
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:26,900
And your daughter, Samantha,

1120
01:07:26,983 --> 01:07:30,692
she must be, what,
eight months now, is it?

1121
01:07:34,733 --> 01:07:36,567
That's right.

1122
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:42,525
She's growing fast every day.

1123
01:07:42,608 --> 01:07:44,483
They always do, don't they?

1124
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,650
Tell me...

1125
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:52,900
What will you do
when she brings home a Negro?

1126
01:07:57,317 --> 01:07:59,567
When she brings home a Negro?

1127
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,400
Your daughter, Samantha.

1128
01:08:01,483 --> 01:08:06,400
What will you do the day she
brings home a young Negro male?

1129
01:08:11,775 --> 01:08:12,942
She's an infant, sir.

1130
01:08:13,025 --> 01:08:14,650
I'm well aware.

1131
01:08:16,608 --> 01:08:19,192
And that's not an answer
to my question.

1132
01:08:30,192 --> 01:08:32,275
She won't.

1133
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,025
Why not?

1134
01:08:40,233 --> 01:08:42,150
Because...

1135
01:08:47,483 --> 01:08:53,108
Respectfully, Director,
why are we talking about my daughter?

1136
01:08:53,192 --> 01:08:54,650
You killed in Korea.

1137
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:55,775
Yes.

1138
01:08:55,858 --> 01:08:58,192
Not for country.

1139
01:08:58,275 --> 01:09:02,983
Maybe that's why you enlisted.
But you killed for survival.

1140
01:09:03,067 --> 01:09:05,150
You would have done anything

1141
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:08,275
to get back home safe
to your family, wouldn't you?

1142
01:09:08,942 --> 01:09:10,275
Of course.

1143
01:09:12,275 --> 01:09:15,567
Think of your family now,
Agent Mitchell.

1144
01:09:17,067 --> 01:09:19,650
When you look at Hampton,
think of Samantha,

1145
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:22,983
because that's what's at stake
if we lose this war.

1146
01:09:24,067 --> 01:09:26,025
Our entire way of life.

1147
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,358
Rape, pillage, conquer.

1148
01:09:32,983 --> 01:09:34,525
You follow me?

1149
01:09:36,442 --> 01:09:38,317
I do, sir.

1150
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,858
Hampton's in Menard
doing two to five.

1151
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,525
Hampton is getting out,

1152
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:44,650
while the State Supreme Court
considers his appeal.

1153
01:09:44,733 --> 01:09:46,233
In the interim,

1154
01:09:46,317 --> 01:09:48,567
your CI is our best chance

1155
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:51,567
at neutralizing him,
Agent Mitchell.

1156
01:09:53,275 --> 01:09:57,900
<i>Maybe it's time to use O'Neal
more creatively.</i>

1157
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:48,900
You look beautiful,
you know that?

1158
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:50,567
- You know that?
- Mm-hmm.

1159
01:11:04,067 --> 01:11:05,817
Whoo!

1160
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,192
Now, y'all save that shit

1161
01:11:07,275 --> 01:11:08,567
for when you get back
to the house, all right?

1162
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,525
Careful, now.

1163
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:18,692
Whew!

1164
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,650
You look good, Chairman!

1165
01:11:21,358 --> 01:11:22,775
How ya feelin'?

1166
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:25,275
I miss y'all motherfuckers,
man!

1167
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:27,067
Come on, man!

1168
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:29,400
Yeah, so where you wanna go?
You hungry? What? What do you want?

1169
01:11:32,108 --> 01:11:33,983
Headquarters.

1170
01:11:35,608 --> 01:11:37,317
Mm-hmm.

1171
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,650
Shit, headquarters it is, boy.

1172
01:12:02,942 --> 01:12:05,233
How'd y'all...

1173
01:12:06,567 --> 01:12:08,025
But it was burned down.
I saw...

1174
01:12:08,108 --> 01:12:09,983
Then the whole
neighborhood came out.

1175
01:12:10,067 --> 01:12:13,858
The pushers, the grannies,
the Crowns. Everybody.

1176
01:12:15,358 --> 01:12:16,858
'Specially this one right here.

1177
01:12:16,942 --> 01:12:18,733
- He practically led the charge.
- Come on, now, man.

1178
01:12:18,817 --> 01:12:21,067
Don't be modest, brother.
You almost lived here.

1179
01:12:36,275 --> 01:12:38,067
Power.

1180
01:12:39,692 --> 01:12:41,733
Anywhere there's people,

1181
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,192
there's power.

1182
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:48,192
Right on.

1183
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:55,692
Thank you, brother.

1184
01:13:03,733 --> 01:13:05,108
Chairman!

1185
01:13:05,192 --> 01:13:06,733
Oh!

1186
01:13:06,817 --> 01:13:09,150
I was wondering
why it was so quiet, man.

1187
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:10,525
I was like,

1188
01:13:10,608 --> 01:13:11,692
"These motherfuckers
better be out here

1189
01:13:11,775 --> 01:13:13,358
feedin' these babies overtime

1190
01:13:13,442 --> 01:13:14,317
if they're not gonna welcome
a brother home, God damn it!"

1191
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,567
Come on, man!

1192
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:16,900
You made it.

1193
01:13:16,983 --> 01:13:18,775
Oh, man, I missed
y'all motherfuckers, man.

1194
01:13:18,858 --> 01:13:20,525
- We missed you, too, man!
- Oh, my God.

1195
01:13:20,608 --> 01:13:22,733
You know
I missed you, too, man!

1196
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,067
Yeah, brother.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1197
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:27,400
All right,
let me outta here!

1198
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:28,983
Let me outta here!
Let me outta here!

1199
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:30,317
You the man.
You stay in here and man up!

1200
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,233
Black
Panther Party headquarters.

1201
01:13:35,317 --> 01:13:36,650
All that complainin'...

1202
01:13:36,733 --> 01:13:38,400
Right on,
how's it going, brother?

1203
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,817
Rush?

1204
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,442
I feel your pain, sister.

1205
01:13:51,525 --> 01:13:53,525
But we at war, you know?

1206
01:13:53,608 --> 01:13:56,400
He's gone.

1207
01:13:56,483 --> 01:13:58,483
- Excuse me, sister.
- All right.

1208
01:14:02,775 --> 01:14:04,525
What's up?

1209
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,567
Jimmy Palmer died.

1210
01:14:10,817 --> 01:14:12,400
What? How?

1211
01:14:12,483 --> 01:14:13,942
Can we talk about this
outside, Fred, please?

1212
01:14:14,025 --> 01:14:15,608
He was shot
while you were gone.

1213
01:14:15,692 --> 01:14:17,275
Comrade, why is this the first
I'm hearin' about this, man?

1214
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:18,317
Who was shot?

1215
01:14:19,983 --> 01:14:21,608
Jimmy Palmer.

1216
01:14:21,692 --> 01:14:23,275
Yeah, he's fine.
Y'all know that.

1217
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,942
He died, Jake.

1218
01:14:25,942 --> 01:14:26,983
Last night.

1219
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:28,233
Nah, that's impossible.

1220
01:14:29,483 --> 01:14:31,650
I just talked to him
the other day.

1221
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:35,275
Anybody got the number
for Loretto...

1222
01:14:35,358 --> 01:14:37,192
He was moved
to the county hospital.

1223
01:14:37,275 --> 01:14:38,483
Get this fuckin'...

1224
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:40,942
Get this shit off of me.
Hey, motherfuck...

1225
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:42,942
They killed him.

1226
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:44,900
They fuckin' killed him.

1227
01:14:46,817 --> 01:14:48,233
Jake.

1228
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:54,608
Jake.

1229
01:14:54,692 --> 01:14:56,317
Jake!

1230
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:03,275
<i>Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!</i>

1231
01:15:03,358 --> 01:15:06,900
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!
Chairman Fred!

1232
01:15:46,442 --> 01:15:47,733
I'm free.

1233
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:56,233
I'm free, y'all!

1234
01:15:59,817 --> 01:16:02,400
I need everybody
to repeat after me! I am...

1235
01:16:02,483 --> 01:16:03,900
I am...

1236
01:16:03,983 --> 01:16:05,525
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1237
01:16:05,608 --> 01:16:07,192
- I am...
- I am...

1238
01:16:07,275 --> 01:16:09,150
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1239
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:10,608
- I am...
- I am...

1240
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:12,233
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1241
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,733
- I am...
- I am...

1242
01:16:13,817 --> 01:16:15,483
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1243
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:17,025
- I am...
- I am...

1244
01:16:17,108 --> 01:16:18,775
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1245
01:16:18,858 --> 01:16:20,067
- I am...
- I am...

1246
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,733
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1247
01:16:21,817 --> 01:16:23,192
Drummer,
lemme hear the people beat!

1248
01:16:26,692 --> 01:16:28,650
This is what we call
the people beat.

1249
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:31,858
Started in 1966 by Huey Newton
and Bobby Seale.

1250
01:16:31,942 --> 01:16:34,983
It's the beat that manifests
in you, the people.

1251
01:16:35,067 --> 01:16:36,733
They can't never stop the party

1252
01:16:36,817 --> 01:16:38,608
unless they stop the people!

1253
01:16:38,692 --> 01:16:42,233
Well, ain't you high? Ain't you high?

1254
01:16:42,317 --> 01:16:45,400
I'm high off the people!

1255
01:16:45,483 --> 01:16:47,442
- I'm high!
- I'm high!

1256
01:16:47,525 --> 01:16:49,317
- I'm high!
- I'm high!

1257
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,775
- High, high, high...
- High, high, high...

1258
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,400
- ...off the people!
- ...off the people!

1259
01:16:55,483 --> 01:16:57,650
So, if you were asked
to make a commitment at age 20,

1260
01:16:57,733 --> 01:17:01,108
and you said, "I'm too young to
die," then you're dead already!

1261
01:17:08,567 --> 01:17:10,775
If you dare to struggle,
you dare to win!

1262
01:17:10,858 --> 01:17:14,817
If you dare not struggle, then,
God damn it, you don't deserve to win!

1263
01:17:22,025 --> 01:17:25,400
Right. Right.

1264
01:17:27,983 --> 01:17:31,275
Put a fist in the air
for Comrade Jimmy Palmer.

1265
01:17:36,942 --> 01:17:41,983
Jimmy Palmer died
a revolutionary death.

1266
01:17:42,067 --> 01:17:47,983
He stood face-to-face and toe-to-toe
with pig Daley's henchmen,

1267
01:17:48,067 --> 01:17:51,275
and made the greatest sacrifice
one could ever make.

1268
01:17:51,358 --> 01:17:52,858
Right on!

1269
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:03,817
I don't believe I'm gonna die
in no car wreck!

1270
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,900
I don't believe I'm gonna die
slippin' on no ice!

1271
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:10,733
I don't believe I'm gonna die
'cause I got a bad heart!

1272
01:18:10,817 --> 01:18:14,067
I believe I'm gonna die
doin' what I was born for!

1273
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:16,817
I believe I'm gonna die
high off the people!

1274
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:21,192
I'm gonna die for the people,
'cause I live for the people!

1275
01:18:21,275 --> 01:18:24,817
I live for the people,
'cause I love the people!

1276
01:18:30,775 --> 01:18:34,358
And as for them bloodthirsty,
murderous pigs...

1277
01:18:34,442 --> 01:18:36,650
Well, some of you might be
in the audience right now, huh?

1278
01:18:38,067 --> 01:18:40,900
Sittin' on a tape recorder,
gun in your hand!

1279
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,400
Well, lemme make it plain.

1280
01:18:43,483 --> 01:18:46,067
Kill a few pigs,
get a little satisfaction.

1281
01:18:49,567 --> 01:18:51,025
Right on. Right on.

1282
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:55,525
Kill some more pigs,
get some more satisfaction.

1283
01:18:56,983 --> 01:18:59,650
Kill 'em all
and get complete satisfaction!

1284
01:19:09,233 --> 01:19:12,233
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1285
01:19:12,317 --> 01:19:15,025
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1286
01:19:15,108 --> 01:19:18,775
It's not a question of violence
or non-violence.

1287
01:19:18,858 --> 01:19:21,108
It's a question of
resistance to fascism

1288
01:19:21,192 --> 01:19:23,483
or non-existence
within fascism!

1289
01:19:25,358 --> 01:19:28,233
You can murder a liberator,
but you can't murder liberation!

1290
01:19:28,317 --> 01:19:31,775
You can murder a revolutionary,
but you can't murder a revolution!

1291
01:19:31,858 --> 01:19:35,650
And you can murder a freedom fighter,
but you can't murder freedom!

1292
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,567
- I said I am...
- I am...

1293
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,567
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1294
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:44,067
- I am...
- I am...

1295
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,858
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1296
01:19:45,942 --> 01:19:47,150
- I am...
- I am...

1297
01:19:47,233 --> 01:19:48,942
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1298
01:19:49,025 --> 01:19:50,275
- I am...
- I am...

1299
01:19:50,358 --> 01:19:51,817
- ...a revolutionary!
- ...a revolutionary!

1300
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,567
Drummer,
lemme hear the people beat!

1301
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:55,108
Lemme hear the people beat!

1302
01:19:55,192 --> 01:19:57,317
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1303
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,650
Chairman Fred! Chairman Fred!

1304
01:19:59,733 --> 01:20:02,733
Right! Right!

1305
01:20:02,817 --> 01:20:05,442
Put your fists in the air!

1306
01:20:05,525 --> 01:20:07,567
Right!

1307
01:20:15,192 --> 01:20:18,567
Winters, fuck you doin' here?

1308
01:20:19,358 --> 01:20:21,692
Lookin' for some answers.

1309
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,942
Answers to what?

1310
01:20:24,025 --> 01:20:27,608
Remember I saw you not too
long ago at the hospital?

1311
01:20:27,692 --> 01:20:28,775
Yeah.

1312
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,817
The pigs took my man
outta there.

1313
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,650
I don't know nothin'
about that.

1314
01:20:34,733 --> 01:20:37,817
No, look, I was thinking maybe
you could ask a couple questions.

1315
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,192
And fuck my money up?

1316
01:20:40,275 --> 01:20:41,692
Nigga, do you have any idea

1317
01:20:41,775 --> 01:20:43,692
how treacherous them
crackers is down there?

1318
01:20:43,775 --> 01:20:45,692
- I don't want no parts of that.
- Reg, please. Please, man.

1319
01:20:45,775 --> 01:20:50,525
Look, man, I'm cold and I'm hungry.
Now, get out my way.

1320
01:20:50,608 --> 01:20:52,275
Come on, brother!

1321
01:20:52,358 --> 01:20:54,150
I ain't your brother!

1322
01:20:54,233 --> 01:20:57,192
Now, get the fuck off my porch
before you end up like your boy did.

1323
01:20:57,275 --> 01:20:58,817
Man, fuck...

1324
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:05,733
No, I just wanted to know what happened.
Reg! Hey, Reg!

1325
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:08,525
I just wanted to know
what happened to my friend!

1326
01:21:09,192 --> 01:21:10,858
Reg!

1327
01:21:12,358 --> 01:21:13,567
Yeah.

1328
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,233
Reg!

1329
01:21:16,608 --> 01:21:19,192
Across the street
from the oil refinery.

1330
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:21,067
Uh, Lawn... Lawndale and 45th.

1331
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:26,692
He... He's got a gun.
A big one.

1332
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:07,067
What are you doin'?
That's private! It's private...

1333
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,858
You think you gonna be
a bad mother?

1334
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,025
It was a question.

1335
01:22:11,108 --> 01:22:13,067
Why you gotta
ask yourself that?

1336
01:22:15,358 --> 01:22:17,400
I don't... I don't know.

1337
01:22:17,483 --> 01:22:22,150
Maybe the fact that I'm bringin'
a child into a war zone.

1338
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:25,525
These aren't considerations
you have to make.

1339
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:26,817
You get to go out there,

1340
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,733
talk about dyin'
a revolutionary death

1341
01:22:28,817 --> 01:22:31,483
and how your body belong
to the revolution,

1342
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:35,858
because you don't have another
person growin' inside your body.

1343
01:22:40,567 --> 01:22:42,275
So, you regret it?

1344
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:44,483
- What?
- Havin' my baby.

1345
01:22:46,608 --> 01:22:48,150
Do you?

1346
01:22:51,817 --> 01:22:55,483
When I dedicated my life to the
people, I dedicated my life.

1347
01:22:56,025 --> 01:22:57,400
You dig?

1348
01:23:00,233 --> 01:23:03,317
And it wasn't till Menard
when I realized what that...

1349
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,567
When I realized
what that meant.

1350
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:09,817
'Cause in order
to survive in there,

1351
01:23:12,567 --> 01:23:14,983
a part of me had to die, man.

1352
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:21,483
You couldn't have told me that,
when I got out,

1353
01:23:23,858 --> 01:23:25,650
that I have...

1354
01:23:26,817 --> 01:23:29,525
That I'd had
every reason to live.

1355
01:23:36,608 --> 01:23:38,733
So, do you regret it?

1356
01:23:41,567 --> 01:23:42,942
Do you?

1357
01:23:45,108 --> 01:23:46,233
Uh...

1358
01:23:47,608 --> 01:23:50,400
I wanna... I wanna
share somethin' with you.

1359
01:24:03,483 --> 01:24:07,650
"Like the masses, I was in awe,

1360
01:24:07,733 --> 01:24:11,233
when I first laid eyes
on all the things you are.

1361
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:14,942
I heard that speech,

1362
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:18,358
and when that indent
pierced your cheek,

1363
01:24:18,442 --> 01:24:20,233
I knew we'd make noise.

1364
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:25,233
I just... I thought
it'd be in the streets.

1365
01:24:25,317 --> 01:24:28,525
What magic a philistine
and a poet could create."

1366
01:24:28,608 --> 01:24:30,233
A philistine?
Who you callin' a philistine?

1367
01:24:30,317 --> 01:24:33,442
You're seriously
interrupting me right now?

1368
01:24:36,108 --> 01:24:41,567
"What magic a philistine
and a poet could create.

1369
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:45,192
However contradictory,
it would seem that it's fate.

1370
01:24:47,358 --> 01:24:53,608
We educate, we nurture,
we feed, and we lobby.

1371
01:24:53,692 --> 01:24:57,442
<i>Perhaps we're here for more than
just war with these bodies."</i>

1372
01:24:58,525 --> 01:25:00,317
Let's go!

1373
01:25:07,942 --> 01:25:11,317
<i>"Will my comrades
think me treasonous?</i>

1374
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,025
Can it please
have your dimples?

1375
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:19,442
Will my chairman
look at me differently?

1376
01:25:19,525 --> 01:25:21,733
Will its eyes
have your twinkle?

1377
01:25:25,358 --> 01:25:27,525
Will our child be
the apple of his eye?

1378
01:25:27,608 --> 01:25:31,442
Or constantly
get the compromise?

1379
01:25:31,525 --> 01:25:36,858
The rata-tat-tat of gunfire,
the clink of jail cells, lullabies.

1380
01:25:38,817 --> 01:25:40,650
We scream,

1381
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:45,483
and we shout,
and we live by this anthem,

1382
01:25:45,567 --> 01:25:49,775
but is power to the people
really worth that ransom?

1383
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:52,650
'Cause that's
what a mother does.

1384
01:25:52,733 --> 01:25:55,983
She gives the world the most
precious things that she loves.

1385
01:25:56,067 --> 01:25:59,317
And I love you,
and I love our baby, too,

1386
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:03,317
and there's nothing more radical
than seein' that through.

1387
01:26:04,733 --> 01:26:08,817
Born pure to the blood,
with the heart of a Panther.

1388
01:26:10,483 --> 01:26:12,650
<i>So, no regrets.</i>

1389
01:26:15,942 --> 01:26:17,567
<i>I know my answer."</i>

1390
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:20,275
Oh, shit.

1391
01:27:23,733 --> 01:27:24,983
Please.

1392
01:27:27,483 --> 01:27:28,817
Please.

1393
01:27:30,608 --> 01:27:31,983
Please.

1394
01:27:39,233 --> 01:27:40,692
Please, no!

1395
01:27:42,733 --> 01:27:44,483
Hey!

1396
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:18,317
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1397
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,317
Hey. Hey, don't shoot me.
Don't shoot.

1398
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,733
Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

1399
01:28:21,817 --> 01:28:24,983
I'm not a rat.
I'm not a rat, I swear.

1400
01:28:48,317 --> 01:28:49,233
Thank you.

1401
01:28:49,317 --> 01:28:50,983
You're welcome.

1402
01:28:52,858 --> 01:28:54,525
Do you want me to get that?

1403
01:28:56,525 --> 01:28:59,358
It's probably
one of them crank callers.

1404
01:28:59,442 --> 01:29:03,692
As if it ain't bad enough
I'll never see my son again.

1405
01:29:03,775 --> 01:29:06,775
You think the mothers
of those police officers

1406
01:29:06,858 --> 01:29:10,233
that killed the Soto brothers
are getting harassed like this?

1407
01:29:10,317 --> 01:29:11,442
Please.

1408
01:29:20,608 --> 01:29:22,358
I know what you're gonna say,
but...

1409
01:29:22,442 --> 01:29:25,317
No. No, stop. Stop that.

1410
01:29:30,567 --> 01:29:32,442
I'm sorry, Mrs. Winters.

1411
01:29:33,942 --> 01:29:37,567
Let's
talk about something else.

1412
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:40,317
How's Deborah?

1413
01:29:41,858 --> 01:29:43,358
Tired of being pregnant.

1414
01:29:46,108 --> 01:29:47,608
Yeah.

1415
01:29:47,692 --> 01:29:49,192
Yeah.

1416
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,400
Tell her to cherish it.

1417
01:29:52,483 --> 01:29:54,108
All of it.

1418
01:29:55,192 --> 01:29:57,942
Those early days are...

1419
01:30:00,858 --> 01:30:05,525
You know, even when I think
about Jake in my mind,

1420
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:08,108
he's always seven.

1421
01:30:08,192 --> 01:30:09,567
That's how I remember him.

1422
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:12,567
My little boy.

1423
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:19,692
I remember,
one time in church, he said...

1424
01:30:19,775 --> 01:30:22,025
"Mama, may I be excused?"

1425
01:30:22,108 --> 01:30:23,692
I said, "Why, Jake?"

1426
01:30:23,775 --> 01:30:27,067
You know, figuring he was bored
or something.

1427
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:31,608
And he goes,
"Mama, I gotta pass gas."

1428
01:30:34,567 --> 01:30:35,692
Sound like Jake.

1429
01:30:35,775 --> 01:30:37,025
Yeah.

1430
01:30:42,608 --> 01:30:43,733
Yeah.

1431
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:49,192
So well-behaved.

1432
01:30:51,442 --> 01:30:53,775
Just the sweetest little thing.

1433
01:30:56,733 --> 01:30:58,358
Mmm.

1434
01:31:02,025 --> 01:31:04,483
Those folks, though,

1435
01:31:04,567 --> 01:31:08,317
they try to paint my Jake
as some cold-blooded killer.

1436
01:31:10,775 --> 01:31:14,567
He did that.
He did that.

1437
01:31:17,067 --> 01:31:19,442
But that ain't all he did.

1438
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,400
Tell 'em about my Jake,
Chairman.

1439
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:24,358
I will do.

1440
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:25,817
Please.

1441
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:29,942
Yes.

1442
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:45,233
It don't seem fair
that that's his legacy.

1443
01:31:51,567 --> 01:31:52,692
Here.

1444
01:31:55,317 --> 01:31:57,358
C-4.

1445
01:31:57,442 --> 01:31:58,775
Yeah, we got enough there,

1446
01:31:58,858 --> 01:32:00,650
we could blow up city hall,
some more shit.

1447
01:32:00,733 --> 01:32:01,733
Fuck is wrong with you?

1448
01:32:01,817 --> 01:32:03,150
Calm down, comrade, calm down.

1449
01:32:03,233 --> 01:32:04,858
What you mean,
what's wrong with me, man?

1450
01:32:04,942 --> 01:32:07,358
Are y'all fuckin' crazy?
We're not gonna win this war,

1451
01:32:07,442 --> 01:32:10,525
so we gotta do somethin' big
and we gotta do it now!

1452
01:32:13,983 --> 01:32:16,192
You out your mind?

1453
01:32:16,275 --> 01:32:18,942
Man, "complete satisfaction," ain't
that what the fuck you told me?

1454
01:32:19,025 --> 01:32:20,650
"Kill 'em all,
complete satisfaction."

1455
01:32:20,733 --> 01:32:22,608
But I didn't mean it like that.

1456
01:32:22,692 --> 01:32:24,567
- I did not mean it like that.
- I call you "comrade" 'cause we at war!

1457
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:26,900
You're the one
that gave me the game, man!

1458
01:32:26,983 --> 01:32:29,525
Know Jimmy Palmer?

1459
01:32:29,608 --> 01:32:32,525
All right,
you remember Little Bobby?

1460
01:32:32,608 --> 01:32:34,900
Franko Diggs? Thomas Lewis?

1461
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:38,025
Bunchy Carter? Jake Winters?

1462
01:32:40,317 --> 01:32:43,400
All you lookin' to do
is add more names to that list.

1463
01:32:43,483 --> 01:32:46,317
You bomb city hall,
they gonna bomb us.

1464
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,733
I'm ready to die
for the people, Chairman.

1465
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:53,233
How about you?

1466
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:57,692
Is it a goddamn revolution
or what?

1467
01:32:58,483 --> 01:32:59,692
Huh?

1468
01:32:59,775 --> 01:33:00,817
Get this shit
the fuck outta here!

1469
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,067
Why the fuck is we doin' it?

1470
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:03,900
What are we
doin' this shit for?

1471
01:33:03,983 --> 01:33:05,608
Get this shit the fuck outta
here, you fuckin' idiot!

1472
01:33:07,692 --> 01:33:09,942
- Get the fuck on, man!
- Go!

1473
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:14,442
Well, then fuck it, then!
I'm out!

1474
01:33:14,525 --> 01:33:17,025
This whole shit gonna crumble!

1475
01:33:17,108 --> 01:33:18,858
Motherfucker!

1476
01:33:20,942 --> 01:33:22,358
Fuck is you talkin' about,
nigga?

1477
01:33:33,817 --> 01:33:35,608
God damn it!

1478
01:33:37,525 --> 01:33:38,983
Shit.

1479
01:34:02,525 --> 01:34:05,275
<i>FBI,
how may I direct your call?</i>

1480
01:34:05,358 --> 01:34:08,692
Uh, Special Agent Carlyle
for Director Hoover.

1481
01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:14,983
<i>Hello.</i>

1482
01:34:15,067 --> 01:34:17,608
Director Hoover,
good afternoon, sir.

1483
01:34:17,692 --> 01:34:21,525
I am calling with good news.
With great news.

1484
01:34:21,608 --> 01:34:22,942
Two hours ago,

1485
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:26,025
the Illinois Supreme Court
denied Hampton's appeal.

1486
01:34:26,108 --> 01:34:28,608
He's going back to Menard.

1487
01:34:28,692 --> 01:34:30,275
<i>I know.</i>

1488
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:36,775
Well, that's what we wanted,
right?

1489
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:43,108
<i>Prison made Huey Newton
a celebrity.</i>

1490
01:34:43,192 --> 01:34:46,817
<i>It made Eldridge Cleaver
a best-selling author.</i>

1491
01:34:48,442 --> 01:34:51,775
<i>Prison is a temporary solution.</i>

1492
01:34:58,233 --> 01:34:59,650
What you doing?

1493
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:02,025
Goin' through old shit.

1494
01:35:11,692 --> 01:35:14,525
My mom used to babysit him,
you know?

1495
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:16,067
Not all the time,

1496
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:17,608
but his family lived
across the street,

1497
01:35:17,692 --> 01:35:21,233
so every now and then,
she'd watch him.

1498
01:35:21,317 --> 01:35:25,567
We didn't go to the funeral.
It was too much for her.

1499
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:28,858
I don't even think I saw
the photo till months later.

1500
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,775
But I remember when I did.

1501
01:35:32,858 --> 01:35:37,317
Thinkin', "There's people in this
world who want to do that to me?

1502
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,400
Or my brother?

1503
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:41,692
Or my sister?"

1504
01:35:43,775 --> 01:35:47,400
That's when I knew
I had to protect 'em.

1505
01:35:47,483 --> 01:35:50,858
I mean, looking at that photo,
how could you not feel that way?

1506
01:35:56,025 --> 01:35:58,067
Now, here I am.

1507
01:35:59,942 --> 01:36:02,275
About to go back to Menard.

1508
01:36:04,025 --> 01:36:06,733
Where I won't be able
to protect anybody.

1509
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,983
Not even my own son.

1510
01:36:12,983 --> 01:36:15,067
The party will protect him.

1511
01:36:16,233 --> 01:36:18,442
You hear me?

1512
01:36:18,525 --> 01:36:20,733
The people will protect him.

1513
01:36:40,608 --> 01:36:41,942
Here, take this.

1514
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:43,358
Yes, sir.

1515
01:36:44,067 --> 01:36:47,150
Hey. Roy boy.

1516
01:36:47,733 --> 01:36:49,817
How are you?

1517
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:54,150
Look, man, sorry I'm late.
I just, you know...

1518
01:36:54,233 --> 01:36:55,983
How's it goin'?

1519
01:36:58,317 --> 01:37:00,275
It's groovy, right?

1520
01:37:10,567 --> 01:37:12,858
What can I do for you, Roy?

1521
01:37:14,233 --> 01:37:17,317
You've been
to Hampton's apartment, right?

1522
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,317
Right.

1523
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,192
A lot of guns there?

1524
01:37:20,317 --> 01:37:22,900
Of course.

1525
01:37:22,983 --> 01:37:26,608
Good. I need you to draw me
a blueprint of the place.

1526
01:37:29,108 --> 01:37:30,858
Uh, you must not...

1527
01:37:30,942 --> 01:37:33,358
Fred's goin' back
to Menard, man.

1528
01:37:33,442 --> 01:37:36,775
Uh, I think it was his appeal getting
revoked or somethin' like that.

1529
01:37:36,858 --> 01:37:38,525
No, I'm aware.

1530
01:37:38,608 --> 01:37:43,608
All right, well, if you're aware,
then, um, I don't understand.

1531
01:37:45,942 --> 01:37:48,358
You don't have
to understand, Bill.

1532
01:37:48,442 --> 01:37:51,108
You just have to draw me
that blueprint.

1533
01:38:03,442 --> 01:38:05,233
- Listen, Roy.
- Uh-huh.

1534
01:38:07,192 --> 01:38:10,067
You got him, man.
You know, you won.

1535
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:11,442
Fred's...

1536
01:38:13,233 --> 01:38:15,317
What more do you want?

1537
01:38:23,442 --> 01:38:25,608
Are you gonna kill him, Roy?

1538
01:38:28,067 --> 01:38:29,150
Huh?

1539
01:38:41,483 --> 01:38:44,775
I saw you, you know.

1540
01:38:46,692 --> 01:38:47,983
What?

1541
01:38:48,817 --> 01:38:51,150
That day at the speech.

1542
01:38:51,233 --> 01:38:53,192
I watched you.

1543
01:38:53,275 --> 01:38:57,858
I remember thinking to myself,
"Either this guy

1544
01:38:57,942 --> 01:39:01,942
deserves an Academy Award,

1545
01:39:02,025 --> 01:39:04,025
or he really
believes this shit."

1546
01:39:04,108 --> 01:39:06,817
Hey, come on, man, now,
I was doin' my goddamn...

1547
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,650
I was doin' the job
that you told me to do.

1548
01:39:08,733 --> 01:39:10,525
I was doin'
what the fuck you said.

1549
01:39:10,608 --> 01:39:12,150
- The fuck are you talkin' about, man?
- Tell you what, though.

1550
01:39:12,233 --> 01:39:14,942
Let's say I put a call
in to New Haven PD,

1551
01:39:15,025 --> 01:39:19,442
get 'em to send me a few
snapshots of your friend,

1552
01:39:19,525 --> 01:39:21,192
Alex Rackley,

1553
01:39:21,275 --> 01:39:23,317
after they dragged him
from the river,

1554
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,692
cigarette burns
all over his body,

1555
01:39:25,775 --> 01:39:27,942
skin peeling off,

1556
01:39:28,025 --> 01:39:31,650
where the Panthers poured
boiling water all over his cock.

1557
01:39:38,358 --> 01:39:40,650
If they did that to Rackley,

1558
01:39:40,733 --> 01:39:42,900
imagine what they'll do

1559
01:39:42,983 --> 01:39:47,067
when they find out their security
captain is a fucking rat.

1560
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:52,442
A fucking rat.

1561
01:40:09,817 --> 01:40:11,358
Fuck, Roy.

1562
01:40:24,358 --> 01:40:26,775
<i>They name all these ships,
like</i> Apollo <i>and all that, right,</i>

1563
01:40:26,858 --> 01:40:29,483
<i>after Black people,
but ain't no Black astronauts, right?</i>

1564
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,942
Well, I like seein' you smile.

1565
01:40:34,025 --> 01:40:37,067
How about we continue this
at my pad?

1566
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:38,983
Have a nightcap.

1567
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:43,317
I got more than enough alcohol,
you know?

1568
01:40:44,108 --> 01:40:45,483
All right.

1569
01:40:48,108 --> 01:40:49,275
Hi.

1570
01:40:50,942 --> 01:40:52,108
I'm Darlene.

1571
01:40:52,192 --> 01:40:56,275
Hey. Bill.

1572
01:40:56,358 --> 01:40:59,608
What brings you out
so late, Bill?

1573
01:40:59,692 --> 01:41:03,817
You know, it's quiet.
Nobody know who the hell I am.

1574
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,192
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

1575
01:41:05,275 --> 01:41:07,150
Mysterious.

1576
01:41:08,733 --> 01:41:12,692
So, what do you do,
Mystery Man?

1577
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:13,942
Um...

1578
01:41:14,025 --> 01:41:16,775
I used to work for the FBI.

1579
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:27,317
Top me off while I run to the
ladies', Eliot Ness.

1580
01:41:33,608 --> 01:41:35,150
Shit.

1581
01:41:36,358 --> 01:41:40,192
They let niggas
work for the FBI now?

1582
01:41:40,275 --> 01:41:42,858
Is that right? Why don't you
get me an application, brother?

1583
01:41:42,942 --> 01:41:44,067
Mr. FBI man, huh?

1584
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:45,733
Hey, man.
Would you shut the fuck up?

1585
01:41:45,817 --> 01:41:48,067
- Hey, hey, hey!
- God damn it.

1586
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:50,275
Mitchell warned me about you.

1587
01:41:50,858 --> 01:41:52,567
What?

1588
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:54,358
Yeah.

1589
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:55,817
What?

1590
01:41:58,775 --> 01:42:00,567
Look here, just relax.

1591
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:04,775
Okay, we hidin' in plain sight.
Nobody know we in here.

1592
01:42:04,858 --> 01:42:08,317
Check this out, man. I got this
article I want you to read right here.

1593
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:12,483
Yeah, right, it's the article
in this paper. Very important.

1594
01:42:12,567 --> 01:42:15,192
I need you to let the Chairman
read it tomorrow night.

1595
01:42:20,817 --> 01:42:22,775
And put that in his drink.

1596
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:29,525
I don't know what the fuck you
talkin' about, man. I don't...

1597
01:42:29,608 --> 01:42:31,858
Fuck outta here with that shit.

1598
01:42:34,025 --> 01:42:35,483
- My mistake.
- All articles and shit, man.

1599
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:37,983
No, no, it's all good,
that's my mistake.

1600
01:42:38,067 --> 01:42:40,733
No, I guess I had
the wrong guy.

1601
01:42:40,817 --> 01:42:42,608
Sorry about that.

1602
01:42:43,567 --> 01:42:45,400
Lemme get outta here.

1603
01:43:07,567 --> 01:43:10,358
Hey! Hey!

1604
01:43:10,442 --> 01:43:12,150
Who are you, man?

1605
01:43:12,233 --> 01:43:14,358
Hey, don't worry about it, slick.
Man, just go back inside.

1606
01:43:14,442 --> 01:43:18,150
Nigga, I'm not gonna poison
him, you hear me?

1607
01:43:18,233 --> 01:43:20,233
You fuckin' hear me?

1608
01:43:22,275 --> 01:43:24,442
Come on, man,
you watch too many movies.

1609
01:43:24,525 --> 01:43:26,942
Look, all it's gonna do
is just make him sleepy.

1610
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:28,525
You want him to go easy, right?

1611
01:43:28,608 --> 01:43:31,025
Who the fuck are you, man?
Tell me your fuckin' name!

1612
01:43:31,108 --> 01:43:33,358
You know... Did Roy send you?

1613
01:43:33,442 --> 01:43:36,733
If you a Fed,
then show me a fuckin' badge!

1614
01:43:36,817 --> 01:43:41,067
Hey! Show me a fuckin' badge, man!
Please!

1615
01:44:14,233 --> 01:44:15,233
Shit.

1616
01:44:22,733 --> 01:44:24,900
Consider that a gift...

1617
01:44:25,942 --> 01:44:27,692
from the Crowns.

1618
01:44:32,817 --> 01:44:35,733
Ain't no shame in runnin'.

1619
01:44:35,817 --> 01:44:37,567
It's not like
they giving you a choice.

1620
01:44:37,650 --> 01:44:40,942
Yeah, maybe he's right,
Chairman.

1621
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:42,692
Go overseas.

1622
01:44:42,775 --> 01:44:48,400
Like you said, start an
international proletariat revolution.

1623
01:44:48,483 --> 01:44:51,150
At least that way,
you're still in the fight.

1624
01:45:00,233 --> 01:45:01,983
So, what about Cuba?

1625
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:04,067
Nuh-uh.

1626
01:45:05,233 --> 01:45:07,692
Cuba's not an option?
Why not?

1627
01:45:07,775 --> 01:45:08,817
Algeria.

1628
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:10,192
Shit.

1629
01:45:17,525 --> 01:45:22,775
Mark Clark, Deputy Minister of
Defense, Peoria chapter.

1630
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:29,317
Central ordered me
to come down here

1631
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:32,400
to check out
how y'all do things,

1632
01:45:32,483 --> 01:45:34,233
here in the Windy City.

1633
01:45:34,317 --> 01:45:35,858
Yeah.

1634
01:45:35,942 --> 01:45:38,567
And your name, comrade?

1635
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:39,567
Bill.

1636
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:41,025
- Bill?
- Mm-hmm.

1637
01:45:41,108 --> 01:45:43,108
Bill.
What cadre are you in, Bill?

1638
01:45:43,192 --> 01:45:45,983
Man, I'm not even in no...

1639
01:45:46,067 --> 01:45:47,858
Thinking about joining up?

1640
01:45:47,942 --> 01:45:50,983
Right on. Right on, Bill.

1641
01:45:51,067 --> 01:45:53,900
You know, I started off
in the NAACP myself.

1642
01:45:53,983 --> 01:45:55,442
Then I had to leave.

1643
01:45:55,525 --> 01:45:57,358
Them Negroes
move too damn slow for me.

1644
01:45:57,442 --> 01:45:58,525
I know a guy.

1645
01:45:58,608 --> 01:46:00,192
Kites up checks, passports,

1646
01:46:00,275 --> 01:46:02,233
driver's licenses,
things of that nature.

1647
01:46:02,317 --> 01:46:05,858
Yeah, but how far we gonna get when
one of us is 37 weeks pregnant?

1648
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:08,025
You could be in Havana
in less than 24 hours.

1649
01:46:08,108 --> 01:46:09,858
And they have some of
the best doctors in the world.

1650
01:46:09,942 --> 01:46:11,858
Yeah, okay,
let's just hope that's not the day

1651
01:46:11,942 --> 01:46:14,525
that Nixon decides
to nuke that motherfucker.

1652
01:46:14,608 --> 01:46:18,233
Look, Algeria,
they got Minister Eldridge.

1653
01:46:18,317 --> 01:46:20,275
Not to mention bungalows
by the sea.

1654
01:46:20,358 --> 01:46:21,858
But the Cubans
got ocean for days.

1655
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:24,233
You know how long it'll take
to get to Algeria?

1656
01:46:24,317 --> 01:46:26,650
That Cuba's
a hop and a skip away.

1657
01:46:26,733 --> 01:46:29,567
There is a network
of safe houses headin' south.

1658
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:31,567
I could put a call
into Central.

1659
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:34,483
Y'all spendin' all this time talkin'
about me goin' to Algerian bungalows,

1660
01:46:34,567 --> 01:46:36,233
when you need
to be talkin' about

1661
01:46:36,317 --> 01:46:38,525
how we gonna build this
motherfuckin' medical clinic.

1662
01:46:44,108 --> 01:46:46,817
Is the party about me
or is it about the people?

1663
01:46:49,817 --> 01:46:50,775
Hmm?

1664
01:47:01,192 --> 01:47:02,567
Chairman...

1665
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:04,775
It's a 5-year bid.

1666
01:47:06,858 --> 01:47:10,442
You know how many people
we could save in five years?

1667
01:47:10,525 --> 01:47:15,317
With a medical clinic
in the middle of the West Side?

1668
01:47:21,525 --> 01:47:24,150
As far as I'm concerned,
that's an easy decision.

1669
01:47:24,983 --> 01:47:26,108
Doc.

1670
01:47:28,567 --> 01:47:30,192
You run it.

1671
01:47:35,858 --> 01:47:38,108
Name it after Jake.

1672
01:47:40,525 --> 01:47:43,108
So, when people hear
the name Jake Winters,

1673
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:47,108
they think about healin'.

1674
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,733
And lovin'.

1675
01:47:51,692 --> 01:47:53,650
Like he loved us.

1676
01:48:00,483 --> 01:48:02,900
And when I get out,

1677
01:48:06,733 --> 01:48:09,525
me and Deb can have our second.

1678
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:17,233
And third,

1679
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:21,275
- and fourth...
- Okay. Easy now.

1680
01:48:21,358 --> 01:48:23,692
I was gonna cap it at five, baby.
Five's a good number, right?

1681
01:48:23,775 --> 01:48:25,775
How 'bout we see how you do
with the one?

1682
01:48:25,858 --> 01:48:27,150
Mm-hmm.

1683
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:37,108
Speaking of children, Chairman,
I'm gonna go and get back to my family.

1684
01:48:37,192 --> 01:48:38,358
Take care, comrade.

1685
01:48:38,442 --> 01:48:40,942
All right.
See you in the morning.

1686
01:48:41,025 --> 01:48:42,233
Comrade.

1687
01:48:54,317 --> 01:48:57,483
Right. Come on, baby, you eat.

1688
01:48:57,567 --> 01:48:59,900
Come on.
This'll get you strong.

1689
01:49:01,358 --> 01:49:02,775
- This'll raise the blood.
- That's way too much.

1690
01:49:02,858 --> 01:49:04,192
Oh, what? What?

1691
01:49:04,275 --> 01:49:05,942
That's too much.

1692
01:49:08,108 --> 01:49:09,567
What's up?

1693
01:49:15,108 --> 01:49:17,525
I thought I'd get
another drink.

1694
01:49:18,733 --> 01:49:20,942
You want a refill, Chairman?

1695
01:50:53,817 --> 01:50:56,983
Hey. Hey. Wake up.

1696
01:50:58,567 --> 01:51:00,067
Look.

1697
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,858
Hey. Hey.

1698
01:51:08,942 --> 01:51:10,400
Wake up.

1699
01:51:11,442 --> 01:51:12,983
Somebody at the door.

1700
01:51:13,067 --> 01:51:15,025
Hey, Tracy.

1701
01:51:16,608 --> 01:51:18,483
I'mma wake the Chairman.

1702
01:51:31,275 --> 01:51:32,358
I'm comin'!

1703
01:51:33,692 --> 01:51:35,108
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1704
01:51:35,192 --> 01:51:37,692
Deb, get down!
Get down! Get down!

1705
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:41,817
No! No!

1706
01:51:49,442 --> 01:51:50,608
Chairman!

1707
01:51:52,233 --> 01:51:54,525
Chairman, wake up!

1708
01:51:54,608 --> 01:51:55,900
Wake up! Chairman!

1709
01:51:55,983 --> 01:51:58,608
Chairman! Chairman! Wake up!

1710
01:51:58,692 --> 01:51:59,733
Chairman, wake up!

1711
01:51:59,817 --> 01:52:02,525
Wake up! Wake up! Chairman!

1712
01:52:02,608 --> 01:52:04,733
Turn on the fucking lights!

1713
01:52:04,817 --> 01:52:06,483
We can't!
We've been shot!

1714
01:52:06,567 --> 01:52:09,900
Turn on the
light or you'll get shot more!

1715
01:52:23,608 --> 01:52:25,108
Come on, come on!

1716
01:52:26,025 --> 01:52:28,942
Betty... Get up. Get up.

1717
01:52:43,067 --> 01:52:45,025
We're comin' out!
We're comin' out!

1718
01:52:45,108 --> 01:52:47,108
Come here! Come here!

1719
01:52:48,692 --> 01:52:50,400
How many are in there?

1720
01:52:50,483 --> 01:52:52,233
Just stop shootin'!
Stop shootin'!

1721
01:52:52,317 --> 01:52:54,442
We got a pregnant sister
in here, God damn it!

1722
01:52:54,525 --> 01:52:56,817
Everyone out! Now!

1723
01:53:03,775 --> 01:53:05,817
I said now!

1724
01:53:16,358 --> 01:53:18,733
Get over here!

1725
01:53:18,817 --> 01:53:21,025
Keep those hands up!

1726
01:53:35,233 --> 01:53:37,733
What do you know?
We got a broad here.

1727
01:53:37,817 --> 01:53:39,108
Take her!

1728
01:53:39,192 --> 01:53:41,067
Come here!

1729
01:53:42,108 --> 01:53:43,317
Get her.

1730
01:53:47,233 --> 01:53:49,317
Looks like
he's gonna make it.

1731
01:53:53,358 --> 01:53:55,483
He's good and dead now.

1732
01:54:19,192 --> 01:54:20,775
Bill.

1733
01:54:20,858 --> 01:54:23,025
Good to see ya.
Come on in.

1734
01:54:30,442 --> 01:54:32,858
Hey. Relax...

1735
01:54:32,942 --> 01:54:36,775
it's just us. I know you don't trust
me, but it's true.

1736
01:54:42,108 --> 01:54:46,233
Why'd you call me here, man?
What do you want?

1737
01:54:49,567 --> 01:54:50,733
Hey?

1738
01:55:00,692 --> 01:55:02,192
Take it.

1739
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:10,775
You don't have to
if you don't want to,

1740
01:55:10,858 --> 01:55:13,400
but I think
you'll be glad you did.

1741
01:55:29,358 --> 01:55:33,567
They're for a gas station
in Maywood.

1742
01:55:35,567 --> 01:55:38,067
It's yours.

1743
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:42,692
There's a lot of money in gas.
Consistent money.

1744
01:55:42,775 --> 01:55:44,692
Legal money.

1745
01:55:46,067 --> 01:55:49,108
You own
your own business now, Bill.

1746
01:55:51,275 --> 01:55:52,858
You're free.

1747
01:55:55,858 --> 01:55:57,733
What do you need?
You need a drink?

1748
01:55:57,817 --> 01:56:00,317
- No, I don't need anythin'...
- You need a drink?

1749
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:01,817
- Excuse me.
- Fuck.

1750
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:03,983
Can you get this man
a scotch?

1751
01:56:06,817 --> 01:56:10,900
So, where are things
with the party?

1752
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:13,525
Any news?

1753
01:56:16,108 --> 01:56:18,775
Fred's dead, man.

1754
01:56:18,858 --> 01:56:21,525
I ain't no goddamn Panther
no more.

1755
01:56:25,567 --> 01:56:27,567
You sure about that?

1756
01:57:12,108 --> 01:57:15,525
<i>What would you tell
your son about what you did then?</i>

1757
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:25,192
I think I'll let your documentary
put a cap on that story.

1758
01:57:25,275 --> 01:57:26,608
I don't know.

1759
01:57:26,692 --> 01:57:29,192
I don't know what I'd tell him,
other than...

1760
01:57:30,692 --> 01:57:33,067
I was part of the struggle.

1761
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:34,983
That's the bottom line.

1762
01:57:36,317 --> 01:57:39,108
I wasn't one of those
armchair revolutionaries.

1763
01:57:39,192 --> 01:57:42,192
One of those people
that wanna sit back now

1764
01:57:42,275 --> 01:57:45,733
and judge the actions
or inactions of people

1765
01:57:45,817 --> 01:57:49,525
when they sit back on the
sideline and did nothing.

1766
01:57:49,608 --> 01:57:52,483
At least I had a point of view.

1767
01:57:52,567 --> 01:57:53,733
I was dedicated.

1768
01:57:53,817 --> 01:57:56,442
And then I had the courage
to get out there

1769
01:57:56,525 --> 01:57:59,025
and put it on the line,
and I did.

1770
01:57:59,567 --> 01:58:01,608
Um...

1771
01:58:01,692 --> 01:58:04,775
I think I'll let history
speak for me.

1772
01:58:09,317 --> 01:58:10,525
Stoppin' down.
