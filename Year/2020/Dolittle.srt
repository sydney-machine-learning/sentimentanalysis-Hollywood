00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:38,202
<i>There once was
a peculiar doctor,</i>

3
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:42,006
<i>known for his
extraordinary ability.</i>

4
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:45,011
<i>He could talk to animals.</i>

5
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:49,414
<i>Dr. Dolittle's reputation
spread far and wide.</i>

6
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,250
<i>Even the queen of England called on him.</i>

7
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,052
<i>So grateful for his help,</i>

8
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,288
<i>she gifted him
a wondrous sanctuary,</i>

9
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,225
<i>whose doors were open
to all creatures.</i>

10
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,294
<i>His days belonged
to the animals,</i>

11
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:07,599
<i>but his heart belonged
to one woman:</i>

12
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:11,537
<i>Lily, the fearless explorer.</i>

13
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:16,073
<i>They traveled the globe
going on great adventures,</i>

14
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:20,046
<i>defending creatures who could
not defend themselves.</i>

15
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:29,120
<i>They made
an extraordinary team.</i>

16
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,158
<i>Soon, that team
became a family.</i>

17
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,628
<i>With Lily by his side,</i>

18
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,198
<i>Dolittle never felt more alive,</i>

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,270
<i>until one day,
she left on an adventure.</i>

20
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,114
<i>Lily died at sea.</i>

21
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,386
<i>Heartbroken, he locked
the gates of the manor</i>

22
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,524
<i>and completely retreated
from the world.</i>

23
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:10,061
<i>As for me and the animals
whose lives he'd saved,</i>

24
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:14,467
<i>we were left to wonder...
could anyone save his?</i>

25
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,540
<i>Until one morning,
a most unlikely creature</i>

26
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,275
<i>found its way
into Dolittle's life.</i>

27
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,144
<i>A very special boy.</i>

28
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,180
<i>In a time where people
thought of animals</i>

29
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,518
<i>only as possessions,
food or sport,</i>

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,355
<i>this boy felt
quite differently.</i>

31
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,698
This way,
me scattered squirrel.

32
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,867
Right.

33
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,434
Junior flushes 'em.

34
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,169
You shoot 'em. Yeah?

35
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,371
Right. Good plan, Dad.

36
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,673
Get ready.

37
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,141
- Shoulder your gun.
- Do I have to, Uncle?

38
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,577
Come on, boy.

39
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,278
Duck!

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,146
Duck! Duck, duck!

41
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,448
- Duck! Duck!
- There, there they go.

42
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,250
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
You got him. You got him.

43
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,251
You got him.
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

44
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,490
- Oh, oh, no, I can't.
- Shoot, shoot, shoot!

45
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,393
You can't keep
missing on purpose.

46
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,595
Oh, look.

47
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,499
He hit something this time.

48
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,738
Oh, no.

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,607
We have to help him.

50
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,475
Aye.

51
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,176
We never leave
an animal suffering.

52
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,478
Not on our error.

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,582
Here you go.

54
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,625
He's a very odd boy.

55
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,370
Follow Poly.

56
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,954
"Home of Dr. John
and Lily Dolittle.

57
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,524
We treat all animals."

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,734
Ah-ah.

59
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,870
Follow Poly.

60
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,243
Secret entrance.

61
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,320
P-Poly? Where'd you go?

62
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,570
Good... good... good dog.

63
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,675
Big, hairy...

64
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,794
It's not good.

65
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,698
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm the only human here.

66
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,166
Just ignore them.

67
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,935
There's no getting past
a Kalahari snare, Doc.

68
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,468
It's an ingenious design.

69
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,470
I think you just
caught yourself a boy.

70
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,840
Let me see.
Wait, I don't want to see.

71
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,474
Just make it go away.

72
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,610
Deep breaths, Doc.
Dab-Dab's got your back.

73
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,878
Don't be afraid, John.

74
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,479
It's just a boy.

75
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,014
This is an opportunity.

76
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,986
Oh, this is a nightmare!

77
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,489
- Oh, come on.
- Pardon me.

78
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,694
Whatever are you
doing up there?

79
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,628
I've come from
Buckingham Palace

80
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,429
on urgent business.

81
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,766
Can you tell me if this is
the home of John Dolittle?

82
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,869
Who are you?

83
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,770
You may call me Lady Rose.

84
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,772
And you are?

85
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,608
Stubbins.

86
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,844
Could you help me down?

87
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,880
This goes against
Dolittle's rules.

88
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:37,515
Why are humans
against the rules again?

89
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,984
If you let humans too close,
you'll get hurt

90
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,052
more than you would if
you didn't let them in at all.

91
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,520
Isn't that right, Doc?

92
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,688
That's enough, everybody.

93
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,923
Back to our routine.

94
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,658
- We have a very full day.
- John!

95
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,593
Pull yourself together.

96
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,795
You can't ignore people
just because they're...

97
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,230
people.

98
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,201
What if they need help?

99
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,936
Possum. Play dead.

100
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,538
This is ridiculous.

101
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,873
Chee-Chee,
will you answer the door?

102
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,708
You're the only one with arms.

103
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,944
I think chess was
enough pressure for one day.

104
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,045
Chee-Chee, boy,

105
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,747
this is what we trained for.

106
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,049
Be brave and get rid of 'em.

107
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,951
And don't forget your mantra.

108
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,087
I am not a prisoner of fear?

109
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,792
You are not a prisoner of fear.

110
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,994
Have you been here before?

111
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,930
The queen's told me
all about it.

112
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,265
It's a most unusual place.

113
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,835
I'm prepared for anything.

114
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,712
Wonderful.

115
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,647
A gorilla answering the door.

116
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,519
Just as the queen said.

117
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,792
Oh, wait a minute.

118
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,996
I have an injured squirrel.

119
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,506
I should never have let you go.

120
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:25,625
Hello?

121
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,179
Oh, look at you.

122
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:52,017
Aren't you peculiar
posing as a twig?

123
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,918
Move, please.

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,155
This is my hiding spot.

125
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:01,895
Not here.

126
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,663
Are you all right down there?

127
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,098
Yeah. Fine.

128
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,967
- Go on.
- Dr. Dolittle?

129
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,603
- Yeah, right.
- You have been summoned

130
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,672
to Buckingham Palace
by the queen herself.

131
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,007
Hoo-ha.

132
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,609
Go on.

133
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:21,048
You should know,
she's fallen gravely ill.

134
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,683
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

135
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,952
Do you understand what
I'm saying?

136
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,021
Go... on.

137
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,123
Go on and be gone!

138
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,095
I don't care about anyone,
anything, anywhere anymore.

139
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,765
The birds will show you out.

140
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,700
Right, everything's tidy.

141
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,771
Lunch will be served in a minute now.

142
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,243
Mmm!

143
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,145
Smells lovely, Doc.

144
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,713
Thanks very much.

145
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,018
Hey, Doc, save some
for us this time.

146
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,255
Sorry, Doc.
Guess I'm scared of kids, too.

147
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,825
Don't worry about that.
Come on, let's eat.

148
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,260
I'm going to be offering today
a brothy soup.

149
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,930
You'll never believe
what we caught in the net.

150
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,898
The queen has asked for you
by name, sir.

151
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,233
Are you hard of hearing?

152
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,104
I told you,
I'm closed for business.

153
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,808
What business?

154
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,712
Treating humans.

155
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,417
Intruder alert.

156
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,053
Don't worry. I'm fine.

157
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,921
Well, I'm not.

158
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,723
My house is descending
into chaos.

159
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,158
I-Is he yours?

160
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,894
I don't own anybody.

161
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,265
Yoshi had an issue
that he came to me with.

162
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,767
He's always cold.

163
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,905
I have an injured squirrel.

164
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,873
I don't know what to do.

165
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,643
How was he injured?

166
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,177
I...

167
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,912
I-I shot him.

168
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,747
What? I can't hear you.

169
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,916
I shot him,
but it was an accident.

170
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,785
Of course,
an accidental firing upon.

171
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,088
Humans never change.

172
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,957
He's very hurt.

173
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,262
Please help him.

174
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,070
Take that.

175
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,941
And this.

176
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,879
I...

177
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,348
I... I...

178
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,053
I'm too beautiful to die.

179
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,060
Oh.

180
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,237
Yes?

181
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,339
He's with us.

182
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,376
Dab-Dab, Jip, light the lamps
and disinfect the surgery.

183
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,045
You will not tend to a squirrel

184
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,314
while the queen of England's
life hangs in the balance.

185
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,916
Oh, you don't know me
very well, do you?

186
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,184
Don't drop him.

187
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,553
We got a code red.

188
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,056
Code red, code red, everybody.

189
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,527
The doctor is back!

190
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,561
Hang on, little buddy.

191
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,563
Whew!
I haven't done this in a while.

192
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:26,833
Let's get everything
the way Doc likes it.

193
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,136
Don't worry. We got you, pal.

194
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,046
Righto. Let's save
this squirrel, shall we?

195
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,914
Okay.

196
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,183
When you wake up,
everything will be fine.

197
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,018
If I die, I swear
I will haunt your house.

198
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,219
Sterilize the scalpels.

199
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,821
Do not lick any instruments.

200
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,157
Patient's condition
has stabilized.

201
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,327
They're understanding him,
and he's understanding them,

202
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,265
in their own languages.

203
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,170
Going through the left
ventricle... it's brilliant.

204
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,606
Wow.

205
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:09,173
Dab-Dab, forceps, please.

206
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,341
Here you go.

207
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,043
That's a piece of celery.

208
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,177
Forceps, Dab-Dab.

209
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,046
Oh, sorry. Here you go.

210
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,314
Still celery.

211
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,348
Forceps?

212
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,183
- Carrot, that is.
- Forceps?

213
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,918
That's a different piece
of celery.

214
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,919
Got it. Forceps.

215
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,187
No, still celery.

216
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,423
Never mind. I'll get it myself.

217
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,328
I want to know how to talk
to the animals.

218
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,096
Chee-Chee, brow.

219
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,299
My brow as well,
when you've got a second.

220
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,067
Right. Sorry.

221
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,638
I'm going to come here
and be Dolittle's apprentice.

222
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,909
Her Majesty has designated
this land a nature preserve.

223
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,176
If she dies,

224
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,046
the deed will be owned
by the Treasury,

225
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,216
and this place goes away.

226
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,117
- Shut down?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,421
There you are.

228
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,121
Whoo, still got it, Doc.

229
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,890
Oh, wow.

230
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,425
Ah.

231
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,959
There, Cheech.

232
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,461
That's the spot.

233
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,963
Keep an eye on Kevin, shall we?

234
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,435
He may be prickly
when the anesthetic wears off.

235
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,007
Revenge.

236
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,942
Okay, okay.

237
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,944
Enough with the pampering.

238
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,514
You need to go
and help the queen.

239
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:26,084
There are things
I no longer do:

240
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,386
work with humans
or leave the house.

241
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,388
- Or bathe.
- Oh, exercise.

242
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,126
Express emotional
vulnerability.

243
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,528
Wake up, John.

244
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,963
If the queen dies,
the Treasury takes the deed,

245
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,132
and we'd lose this house.

246
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,035
You're talking out of
your tail feathers, Poly.

247
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,003
The deed was for life.

248
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,173
The last time I checked,
I was very much alive.

249
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,211
The queen's life, John,
not yours.

250
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,545
Look at that.

251
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:56,147
It just rolls off my back.

252
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,150
I knew I shouldn't have let
monkeys proofread the contract.

253
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:02,055
Elliot, Elsie, you are fired!

254
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,492
It gets worse. We'll be
thrown out of these gates

255
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,560
right in the middle
of hunting season!

256
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,061
- What?
- No, no, no.

257
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,329
Breathe, Chee-Chee.

258
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,197
We get kicked out
if the queen dies?

259
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,201
- We're gonna be hunted!
- Everybody, calm down.

260
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,170
- Look at the state of him now.
- Fear not.

261
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,039
I have an in at, uh,
Regent's Park Zoo.

262
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,411
Everyone, pack your bags!

263
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,078
Ah-ah.

264
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,448
You help the queen,
or we are leaving.

265
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,185
- You're bluffing.
- Don't make me count.

266
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,053
Don't make me count.

267
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,321
One.

268
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,389
Three!

269
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,591
Two.

270
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:41,459
All right!

271
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,060
I'll do it.

272
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,062
Marvelous.

273
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,998
Right, let's get you
ready to go, honey.

274
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,767
- I'll go as I am.
- Not looking like that.

275
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,334
- Just grab my doctor's bag.
- Get him.

276
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,335
Apologies, Doc.

277
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,771
Hold still, now.

278
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:55,574
Take your paws off me!

279
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,242
- This isn't gonna hurt a bit.
- Let's clean him up.

280
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,278
How dare you.

281
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,246
- Whoa.
- Oh, hey, guys.

282
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,182
Arthur? How long have you
been living in there?

283
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,119
I don't know.
What year is it?

284
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,520
Dab-Dab's got the razor.

285
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,288
That's still celery.

286
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,959
Nighty-night, Doc.

287
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,100
Dolittle used to
travel all around the world.

288
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,337
Look.

289
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,371
Rummaging through
my private projects, is it?

290
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,475
How is he?

291
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:31,275
Well, first things first,

292
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,444
the squirrel's name is Kevin.

293
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,213
Expect a full recovery.

294
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,149
And after some violent
grooming, it's been decided.

295
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,254
We will accompany you
to Buckingham Palace after all.

296
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:45,089
Hmm.
You are going back

297
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,526
to whatever burrow
you emerged from.

298
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,330
Try not to shoot anything
on your way home.

299
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,542
Maybe I-I should stay here.
I don't do well in crowds.

300
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,176
We'll look after you, Cheech.

301
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,679
But we all go together,
just like the old days.

302
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,481
Oh, don't forget Doc's forceps.

303
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,182
That's a leek, Dab-Dab.

304
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,584
Sure it is.

305
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,151
Styx?

306
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,319
No.

307
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,388
Where are you? Oh.

308
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,359
So, uh, would you care
to come along?

309
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,532
I know.
I had other plans as well.

310
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,568
Hurry up. Hurry up.

311
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,436
Shh!

312
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,328
Prepare my ride.

313
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,130
Today's gonna be a good day.

314
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,265
I'm gonna do nothing...
just prance around,

315
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,466
think my own thoughts and...

316
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,603
- Oh, he's walking this way. Not a great sign.
- Oh, uh...

317
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,237
He's got no beard.
He looks motivated.

318
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,471
Uh, no. Plimpton, don't be alarmed.

319
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,708
People only say that when
they're about to be alarming.

320
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,342
- Look, I know it's been a while.
- Sorry about this.

321
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,613
- And sorry about that.
- All right.

322
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,180
I'm unavailable.

323
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,348
Unavailable for the man
who changed your life?

324
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,317
We're going to save
the queen, bro!

325
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,252
I am not your bro.

326
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,154
You should be
an Eskimo's rug by now.

327
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,388
- Ow. Claws.
- Ow! Beak!

328
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,524
- Claws.
- Beak!

329
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,258
Now, now, gentlemen.

330
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,227
Oh, you've gained weight.

331
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,763
Why are you riding me?

332
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:34,165
There's, like, four horses
in front of us.

333
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,567
Cheer up, angry bird.

334
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,669
Kick back and enjoy the ride.

335
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,673
I am the ride.

336
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:44,776
Buckingham Palace.

337
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,447
We've hit the big time!

338
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,720
Full speed no longer required!

339
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,791
Whoa.

340
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,762
Welcome home, milady.

341
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,767
Guards! Guards!

342
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,372
Your ladyship, Rose.

343
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,608
They are the queen's
own guests.

344
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,577
Treat them accordingly.

345
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,411
You better
give us a wide berth.

346
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,513
Make way, boys.

347
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:24,382
Plimpton, don't. Stop.

348
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,317
- Don't stop? Odd decision, but...
- Stop!

349
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,956
Whoa!

350
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,592
Aah! Can't see!

351
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:35,596
Oh, my God.

352
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,430
Oh, uh...

353
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,399
Okay.

354
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,436
I blame the hat.

355
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:55,381
Dr. Müdfly.

356
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,616
Lord Badgley.

357
00:21:57,618 --> 00:21:58,717
My lord.

358
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:01,452
I come from the House of Lords.

359
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:04,357
There is great concern
for Her Majesty's health.

360
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,260
I shall continue to leech

361
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:12,864
to circulate the vapors
in the bloodstream.

362
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:15,769
She'll be lucky
to last the week.

363
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,873
This is not the first time
Dr. Dolittle's been here.

364
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,543
You got a dying queen?
Not for long.

365
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:26,345
Dr. Dolittle is in the...

366
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,615
Oh, uh, wait. Wait for me!

367
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:33,652
A stowaway, my lady,
who claims to be Dr....

368
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:35,386
Dr. Dolittle's apprentice.

369
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:36,757
It's quite all right, Gareth.

370
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,726
Well, if he was my apprentice,

371
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:44,263
he should fetch my bags
and keep his gob shut.

372
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:50,502
- A bird.
- A duck.

373
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:52,637
Animals in the queen's chamber?

374
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,706
I demand their
immediate remov...

375
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,440
Ah, Lady Rose.

376
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,342
My apologies.
Please forgive me.

377
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,444
I didn't realize
that you were part of...

378
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:01,780
John Dolittle?

379
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:04,415
- Is that Blaine?
- Blair.

380
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,684
Poopfling?

381
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:06,651
- No.
- It was Mudflap?

382
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,488
- No, it's Müdfly.
- It was... Müdfly.

383
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,322
- With an umlaut.
- Yes.

384
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:12,524
- From the German.
- Of course.

385
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,391
- From the Germans.
- Why is he here?

386
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,764
Her Majesty has personally
requested Dr. Dolittle.

387
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,675
Well, then, let's get to work.

388
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:33,446
All right, Jip,
give her a good sniff.

389
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:42,487
- That dog is licking the queen.
- Don't worry, my love.

390
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:43,657
This is outrageous.

391
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:52,831
Oh, bark.

392
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,700
- You all right, fellow?
- Something smelled wrong.

393
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,369
And that's coming from a guy
who loves the smell of butts.

394
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:59,571
Oh, you do love butt.

395
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:01,472
I detected a whiff
of something else.

396
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:02,743
Floral, with earthy...

397
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:07,411
I'm perplexed, Doc.

398
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,380
I've never smelt anything
like it before.

399
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:13,384
Uh, clearly, Jipsy and I
are out of our depths.

400
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:15,386
- May we consult?
- Well, of course.

401
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,824
I'd be more than happy
to help illuminate...

402
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:42,514
John and I were students
at Edinburgh years ago.

403
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:46,419
Some thought he had
a gift for observation.

404
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:54,795
One minute.

405
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,669
Oh, sorry about that, Mini.

406
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,606
Stay here.

407
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,541
Dab-Dab, clear out the humans.

408
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:12,043
Boyo, fetch the "Botanical
Index" and the tea tin.

409
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,144
Everyone out.

410
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:15,649
Do you understand the words
coming out of my bill?

411
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,519
What do you smell, Jip?

412
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:22,854
Elderberries?

413
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,990
Hemlock?

414
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,493
Negative.

415
00:25:28,495 --> 00:25:29,796
Negative.

416
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:33,867
Aye, aye.

417
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,875
What have you found, Dolittle?

418
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,877
Well, quite possibly,
the answer to everything.

419
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,545
Exposure to toxic...

420
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,947
God, he was like this
at school.

421
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,548
"Lean in, lean in.

422
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,517
I'm saying something
interesting."

423
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,985
I am interested.

424
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:56,254
The queen's symptoms
are due to the effect

425
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:58,089
of a rare Sumatran plant

426
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:00,892
known as the nightshade flower.

427
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:05,563
A solar eclipse will occur
on the 17th of this very month.

428
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,966
If she has not received
the antidote by then,

429
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:09,703
she will perish.

430
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,837
Is that a Turner?

431
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,073
Must be.
What a fine painting.

432
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,976
I say, Dolittle,
what is your plan?

433
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:19,577
The plan?

434
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,280
Uh, I suppose we do need one.

435
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:23,782
Well, the queen's only hope

436
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,583
is a cure that's
never been tested,

437
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,285
from a tree
that's never been seen,

438
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,587
on an island
that's never been found.

439
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,056
Sounds ridiculous
saying it out loud.

440
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:32,626
But regardless of that...

441
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,961
...we have no choice
but to embark

442
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:37,796
on this perilous journey

443
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:40,632
to obtain the fruit
of the Eden Tree.

444
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,067
What?

445
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:45,036
Eden Tree. Oh, my. Fantastic.

446
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,940
The Dolittles with
their Eden Tree Island.

447
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:51,576
- Isn't it enough that your wife...
- Shut up, Blair!

448
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:52,877
Sorry, I-I meant to say:

449
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:55,580
"Lovely to see you
again, Blair."

450
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:58,116
We're off now. Ta-ra.

451
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:01,319
Oh, its fruit is said to cure
every malady known to man,

452
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,887
grant eternal life,

453
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:04,856
even restore
the hair on your head.

454
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:06,958
You must let nothing
pass her lips

455
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,327
that hasn't been made
and served by you.

456
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:10,662
Clear?

457
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:12,797
Yes, I'll see to it.

458
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,332
That's us to the carriage.

459
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:16,735
Jip, you need to stay behind
and guard the queen.

460
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:19,170
- Very important.
- Right, guard dog mode.

461
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:22,042
Stand back, everyone,
while I secure the perimeter.

462
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,046
Excuse me.

463
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:32,951
I do so admire
how you don't give up.

464
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:35,086
The queen is counting
on both of you.

465
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,890
Good luck.

466
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,593
Right. Chop-chop.

467
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:43,595
We got a long voyage
in front of us,

468
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:45,930
and the boat isn't
gonna sail itself.

469
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,133
Deep breath, Yoshi.

470
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:51,136
We haven't got all day.

471
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:52,837
Seems like she's full up.

472
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,106
Maybe we could
squeeze in one more.

473
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,808
Plenty of room.

474
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,077
- Oh, no.
- Uh, Plimpton.

475
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,713
I mean, one more stop,
good fellow.

476
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:04,115
I can't hear you,
because I am not here.

477
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,085
Well, I believe it's time
to go our separate ways.

478
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:08,920
Uh, I'm going with you.

479
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:10,221
Certainly not.

480
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:11,689
It's far too treacherous.

481
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,824
I'm your apprentice.

482
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,025
You? No, no, no.

483
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,660
Oh, you have an apprentice?

484
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,095
You don't need an apprentice
and an ostrich.

485
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,630
I'll go home.

486
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:19,798
I didn't want
to be embarrassed,

487
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,999
so I pretended you belonged.

488
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:22,967
I was helpful in there,
wasn't I?

489
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:24,969
- Hmm...
- The animals like me.

490
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:27,639
I don't take up much space.

491
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:29,974
I think I belong here.

492
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,710
Don't make me go home.

493
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,181
Please.

494
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,258
What is that around your neck?

495
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,793
Come on.

496
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,695
<i>I'm worried about the boy,
Bethan.</i>

497
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:52,664
Give him time. Time is all.

498
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,132
We're hunters, Bethan.

499
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:57,035
Hunters.
It has a certain...

500
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,736
We hunt things.

501
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,004
He frees things.

502
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:01,739
Like rabbits and mice.

503
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,875
He carries spiders outside.

504
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:06,213
Nobody likes spiders...
not even spiders.

505
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,117
I don't know how your sister
put up with him.

506
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,674
Ugh. Ugh.

507
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,909
Poly?
What are you doing here?

508
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,145
Making sure
you don't miss the boat.

509
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:44,816
A-Am I talking to an animal,
just like Dolittle?

510
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:47,051
Oh, no.
I'm speaking human.

511
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:48,955
Better than any parrot
ever has, actually.

512
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:52,893
Now, let's pack some clothes.
Come on.

513
00:29:57,931 --> 00:30:00,798
But Dolittle said
I belong here.

514
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,134
Little help, Tutu?

515
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:06,039
Well, I never heard him say
anything of the sort.

516
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,941
There's something special
about you, Stubbins.

517
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:13,811
Something I've only seen
in two other humans.

518
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:16,214
You belong with us, kid.

519
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:19,250
And you let me worry
about Dolittle. That's my job.

520
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:23,957
So, are you ready for
the adventure of a lifetime?

521
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,094
I'm in.

522
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:31,863
Of course you are.

523
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:32,964
Poly, let's move.

524
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:35,133
We got a boat to catch,
and we're burning daylight.

525
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:36,834
Fret not, <i>ma chérie.</i>

526
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,836
We have the perfect plan.

527
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,104
New plan!

528
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:41,372
New plan!

529
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:43,944
Come on!
Don't let them get away!

530
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:46,911
Why are they chasing us?

531
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,213
We're not criminals.

532
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:49,847
Speak for yourself.

533
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,382
We're wanted in three forests.

534
00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:54,385
And it's not an escape mission
unless you're being chased.

535
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:57,021
Whoa!

536
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,923
That tickles!

537
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,158
Which way, Tutu?

538
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,827
- Down!
- Whoa!

539
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,796
Clear the way!

540
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:06,130
Hey! This way!

541
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:09,067
Get off the road, <i>ma chérie.</i>

542
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:11,838
See you later, suckers.

543
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:19,811
Whew. We've done it.

544
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:21,312
We've done it. We...

545
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:23,248
Missed it.

546
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,817
Okay, boss,
what's our next move?

547
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:28,019
We cut our losses,
change our identities,

548
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:29,320
ditch the kid in the river.

549
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:30,888
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

550
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,158
Wh-Wh-What about that bridge?

551
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,325
Yes, the bridge.

552
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,227
Uh, that was
my next suggestion.

553
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,297
Let's go!

554
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,431
Come on, Doc.

555
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,133
At least get out
of the hammock.

556
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:44,869
Your seasickness will wear off.

557
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:46,904
Try some of this ginger root.

558
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,906
You'll get your sea legs back.
You look terrible.

559
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,208
Ah, button it.

560
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,176
Who put me in this hammock?

561
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:55,313
I am the captain
of this ship, right?

562
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:57,915
Raise the blasted sails, will you?

563
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:01,054
Uh, that's a big bite.

564
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,322
Everyone, look.

565
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:06,057
Is that the boy?

566
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,626
He's coming to finish the job!

567
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:09,294
He won't rest till I'm dead!

568
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,928
He's obsessed!

569
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,331
- John, slow the boat down.
- No.

570
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:16,034
- I want to go faster. I want...
- Sorry, kid. Doc says no.

571
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,468
We're going to miss
all the good current!

572
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,307
- I hope you make it.
- Me, too, Dabs.

573
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,210
- All right, Bets, moment of truth.
- Okay.

574
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:29,347
Oh, big hole, 12 o'clock!

575
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:30,950
Maybe this is a bad idea.

576
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,653
- Let's go, Stubbins, let's go!
- Come on, kid.

577
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:35,889
Get on the boat!
Get on the boat!

578
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,356
I've run out of track!

579
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:40,124
But not courage!

580
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,329
- Fly and be free!
- Whoa!

581
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:51,004
<i>Vive la résistance!</i>

582
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:55,942
- Whoa!
- Is that thing up to code?

583
00:32:57,444 --> 00:32:59,145
Whoa. Whoa.

584
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,387
No!

585
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:10,457
No.

586
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:14,294
Jump, murderer.
You got this.

587
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:23,036
Oh, I can't look.

588
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:29,242
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

589
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,379
Do it again! Do it again!

590
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:37,081
- Do it again! Do it again!
- Yes!

591
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,983
- Crushed it, kid.
- Do it again! Do it again!

592
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,218
You made it.

593
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,287
Why y'all cheering
for the kid who shot me?

594
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,356
Ah, he's all right.

595
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,024
Darling.

596
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,026
- Can I have a word, please? Huh.
- Glad you came around

597
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,262
and saw things my...

598
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:53,565
What was she thinking?

599
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,967
The boy nearly killed himself.

600
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:58,169
Oi! This is my ship, right?

601
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:00,037
And I'm its sovereign.

602
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,239
And there are consequences...

603
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:02,273
To ignoring me.

604
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:04,041
- Is that what you were going to say?
- No, no.

605
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,443
Don't mince my words.

606
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,445
And stop messing
with my routine.

607
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:10,047
But look at the state of you.
You're sick as a dog.

608
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,049
Uh, but actually,
I have my medicine.

609
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:15,052
See? This licorice root
is working a treat.

610
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,357
Sit down, John.

611
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,392
Don't embarrass me
in front of the crew.

612
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:24,028
I'm sparing you embarrassment.

613
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,296
You need a trim.

614
00:34:25,298 --> 00:34:27,131
All right, all right, be quick.

615
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,467
It's important to maintain
my status, yeah?

616
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:32,336
This ship is dangerous...
no place for a... Ow.

617
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:33,337
- Ow!
- What? - Huh?

618
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:34,372
Hurts, man!

619
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:36,073
Private conversation.

620
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:37,310
- Oh, okay. - Okay.
- Sorry.

621
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,413
I know this particular voyage
is hard for you, John.

622
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,348
It is for me, too.

623
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,084
I brought you Lily
just when you needed her,

624
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,788
and now you need
one of your own kind again.

625
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,792
Someone without feathers
or fur.

626
00:34:53,794 --> 00:34:56,227
Fine, the boy can stay,
but it'll be on my terms.

627
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:57,629
And I'll keep him quite busy.

628
00:34:57,631 --> 00:35:00,099
You'll do it
with a smile on your face.

629
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,501
Crew!

630
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:05,506
Seems you got a new shipmate.

631
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:11,510
As I just told Poly,

632
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:14,078
we are a bit shorthanded
after all, so...

633
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,313
You won't regret it.

634
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:16,482
Welcome aboard.

635
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:18,349
I hear you could be
a big help...

636
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:20,117
...by cleaning this up.

637
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,553
That, too,
if you wouldn't mind.

638
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:23,187
Oops. Those as well.

639
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:25,189
And that.

640
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,525
I got these.

641
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:28,995
Careful with that
medical equipment.

642
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:34,535
Because a parrot's in charge
of my ship! Brilliant!

643
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:39,138
He's absolutely thrilled
to have you.

644
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,586
Hmm.

645
00:35:54,588 --> 00:35:56,488
Hello there, little squid.

646
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,090
You don't understand me,
do you?

647
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:00,559
That would be preposterous.

648
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:03,562
- Müdfly.
- I wasn't talking to the squid!

649
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:07,499
I'm dispatching a frigate,
the <i>Britannia,</i>

650
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:10,201
to follow Dolittle.

651
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:14,107
But you must not support him
in his foolishness, my lord.

652
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,646
England has enemies everywhere

653
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:24,583
waiting for the slightest
sign of weakness.

654
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:28,119
Entrusting beloved Britain
to a child queen?

655
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:30,121
That is lunacy.

656
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:31,490
So, while I remain here

657
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:34,458
ensuring no one prevents me
from taking the throne,

658
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,395
you will be on the <i>Britannia</i>

659
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:41,602
making certain
Dolittle never returns.

660
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:56,615
Great. Round two, yeah?

661
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:58,750
You got me on the ropes,
you have, Cheech.

662
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,552
Come on. One, two.

663
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,188
Jab, jab, cross.

664
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:04,324
The best form of defense
is attack.

665
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,275
I really don't want
to fight you.

666
00:37:24,277 --> 00:37:25,777
We're not fighting, are we?

667
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,313
It's a therapeutic session.

668
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,558
I-I think I'm getting this.

669
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,361
I'm actually starting
to understand.

670
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:17,294
<i>Stop worrying, John.</i>

671
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:20,565
<i>Every step is planned out
in my journal.</i>

672
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:24,270
<i>I'll be back
before you even miss me.</i>

673
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:35,683
Are you all right?

674
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,019
I think I'm beginning
to understand

675
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:43,488
a little bit of what
the animals are saying.

676
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,258
Seems you are, boyo.

677
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:56,400
What kind of polar bear
works on their tan?

678
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:58,335
Well, what kind of bird...

679
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,304
Wait, are you even a bird?

680
00:39:00,306 --> 00:39:01,873
- Of course I am.
- Well, can you fly?

681
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,340
- No.
- Can you swim?

682
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:04,341
No.

683
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,477
Well, what can you do?

684
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,045
- I can run.
- I can run.

685
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:08,747
What bird stuff can you do?

686
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:10,784
Well, what bear stuff
can you do?

687
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,722
You win this round.

688
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:28,434
Ro...

689
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,771
Pickles?

690
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:34,608
Oh, you were saying "warship."

691
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,743
Weird time to be asking
for pickles.

692
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:39,644
I mean, who could eat
when we're under attack?

693
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:42,379
Enemy, starboard aft.

694
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:45,382
Elliott, you and Elsie
ready the machine.

695
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:48,555
We're gonna need speed.
Send out the call.

696
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:55,660
Which way are the lifeboats?

697
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:56,795
This whole thing is
a death boat.

698
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:58,395
Mini, mind the lookout.

699
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:01,398
Stubbins, boy, I need you
now more than ever...

700
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,502
- to stand still.
- I surrender!

701
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:04,870
We surrender!

702
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:06,738
Oh...

703
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,308
hello, Blair,
you chinless wonder.

704
00:40:10,343 --> 00:40:13,812
He said something
about my chin, didn't he?

705
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:15,814
It's a magnificent chin, sir.

706
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:17,414
We're in their sights.

707
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:18,950
Cannons are taking aim.

708
00:40:18,952 --> 00:40:21,655
Let's turn this ship!

709
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,690
I'm on my way.

710
00:40:25,692 --> 00:40:29,530
It is time for me to slip into
something less comfortable.

711
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:39,604
Hello...!

712
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:41,708
I bought a front-row seat
to crazy town.

713
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:46,478
Once Humphrey's been secured,

714
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,445
you pull me out
on Yoshi's signal.

715
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,816
Me? No, I-I can't handle
that type of pressure, Doc.

716
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:53,652
I'm a "cheer quietly from
the sidelines" kind of gorilla.

717
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,419
Don't worry, Cheech.

718
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:57,789
You'll rise
to the occasion, huh?

719
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,659
You're stronger than you know.

720
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:04,461
Now, remember, courage
is not the absence of fear.

721
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,932
Wait. You got cut off.

722
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,633
I-I can't hear you.

723
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,401
I need the second part!

724
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:12,573
No time, Cheech. Let's go.

725
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,183
Oh, look, look.

726
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:26,985
They're already
abandoning ship.

727
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:28,889
Boom!

728
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:35,994
Oh, this is gonna be cold.

729
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,931
But I'm coming in hot!

730
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:46,571
Humphrey here.

731
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:48,575
Let's hook it up.

732
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,216
Where we headed?

733
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,519
South.

734
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:06,459
Okay, I can do this.
I can do this.

735
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:12,230
Full steam ahead!

736
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:13,901
Go, Humphrey, go!

737
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:16,870
Are they pulling away?

738
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:20,038
Do it, whale, do it!

739
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,907
Whoo-hoo!
- It's working!

740
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,608
- How is this possible?
- Well, sir, it appears

741
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,777
Dolittle and a polar bear
have harnessed a whale...

742
00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:28,046
It was a rhetorical question.

743
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:28,982
Just fire!

744
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,823
I dropped the rope!

745
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:47,634
I failed.
I knew I couldn't do it.

746
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,513
- Yoshi!
- Hang on.

747
00:43:01,515 --> 00:43:03,016
I'm coming, kid!

748
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:06,851
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- You're doing great.

749
00:43:06,853 --> 00:43:08,653
Oh, this is gonna
murder my back.

750
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:11,758
Quit complaining,
you oversized flamingo.

751
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:21,833
Oh, no, no, no.

752
00:43:21,835 --> 00:43:23,036
Oh, no.

753
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:28,709
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

754
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,625
- Oh!
- Yes!

755
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:54,733
I let you down, Doc.

756
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:56,634
Look at me.

757
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,603
I'm fine. We're all fine.

758
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:00,839
- I froze.
- No, no, no, Cheech.

759
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:02,807
It's okay to be scared.

760
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:04,611
Mm-mm.

761
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:09,047
You saved me, did you?

762
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:10,348
Fair play.

763
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,885
Thanks very much.

764
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:14,888
Well done, everybody.

765
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:18,656
Feel like you belong now, kid?

766
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:20,592
I guess I do.

767
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:22,060
- We lost 'em.
- I guess I do.

768
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:23,795
Great work, gang.

769
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:25,999
Eat our dust, Mudfly.

770
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:36,808
- They've gotten away, sir.
- Oh, really?

771
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,676
I thought they disappeared
into thin air.

772
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:40,612
I'm afraid not, sir.
They've escaped.

773
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:41,813
Read the room, Lieutenant!

774
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:43,683
I can see they've escaped.

775
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:47,154
But not for long.

776
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:50,055
It's a miracle.

777
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:52,690
That must mean
I am the chosen one.

778
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:54,092
I'm gonna change the wor...

779
00:44:54,094 --> 00:44:56,995
Whale power.

780
00:44:56,997 --> 00:44:59,197
Dolittle had to write
a paper about it,

781
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,900
which, of course,
nobody took seriously.

782
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:04,936
This one even theorizes
the existence of dragons.

783
00:45:04,938 --> 00:45:07,772
Just preposterous.

784
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:10,241
Sir, I'm afraid your obsession
with Dolittle is...

785
00:45:10,243 --> 00:45:12,110
What obsession?
I'm not obsessed with Dolittle.

786
00:45:12,112 --> 00:45:13,878
You're obsessed with Dolittle.

787
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,183
You're the one obsessing
about my obsession with Dol...

788
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:20,251
I'm loath to admit it,

789
00:45:20,253 --> 00:45:23,988
but he's more valuable alive
for now.

790
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,024
But luckily,

791
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:28,728
I think I know
where he's going.

792
00:45:31,932 --> 00:45:33,932
Kevin's log, day seven.

793
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:35,233
I'm now totally isolated.

794
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,035
The enemy has
ingratiated himself

795
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:39,037
with the captain and crew.

796
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:41,239
No sign of promised
tropical island

797
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:43,208
or the magic fruit.

798
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,145
But I will endure.

799
00:46:00,227 --> 00:46:01,993
Take the wheel, Stubbins.

800
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:03,294
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

801
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:05,163
I have to calculate
our route coordinates.

802
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:07,031
The bees are buzzing about you.

803
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:08,466
Seems you are getting

804
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:11,469
a rudimentary grasp
of their language.

805
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:15,106
35 degrees portside.

806
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:19,244
Well, I-I have noticed when
they fly in a zigzag pattern,

807
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:20,780
they sort of go...

808
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:25,817
Which means: "Back off, kid."

809
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:28,221
But when Dab-Dab goes, uh...

810
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:33,224
That means: "Look at this."

811
00:46:33,226 --> 00:46:35,126
Mm. "Look at me."

812
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:36,895
- Oh, close.
- Not bad, though.

813
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:39,166
Oh, uh...
No, when Chee-Chee says...

814
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:42,235
When Chee-Chee says...

815
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:49,741
That means:
"Where's my... blanket?"

816
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:51,011
Very good.

817
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:57,516
Is that the map
of Eden Tree Island?

818
00:46:57,518 --> 00:47:01,052
The Eden Tree cannot
be found on any map.

819
00:47:01,054 --> 00:47:03,054
And to call it an island
is to suggest

820
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:07,025
that it is of our world,
and it is anything but.

821
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:09,861
That is why we must first go
to Monteverde,

822
00:47:09,863 --> 00:47:11,129
birthplace of the only person

823
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:13,097
to ever chart a course
to the tree.

824
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:14,332
Her name was Lily.

825
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:17,001
She wrote the route
in a journal,

826
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:19,237
but on her voyage,
she was shipwrecked.

827
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:23,243
The world lost the greatest
explorer I've ever known.

828
00:47:25,278 --> 00:47:27,245
The journal
from that expedition

829
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:29,182
was all that survived.

830
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,322
Elliot, Elsie, do you mind?

831
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:40,158
So, anyway,
you get the picture.

832
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,126
To have any chance
of finding the tree,

833
00:47:42,128 --> 00:47:45,063
we have to go to Monteverde and
steal that flippin' journal.

834
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:46,965
Steal the journal?

835
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:48,132
Did I say that?

836
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:49,970
Well, what's the worst
that can happen?

837
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:56,874
Don't worry.
I know an omen when I see one,

838
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:59,145
and that was not an omen.

839
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:03,350
Stealing the journal
is not a big deal.

840
00:48:05,418 --> 00:48:07,418
In fact,

841
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,890
Monteverde itself
is not a big deal.

842
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:16,595
<i>The stop at Monteverde
was a very big deal.</i>

843
00:48:16,597 --> 00:48:19,931
<i>After all, this island
of bandits and thieves</i>

844
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:23,067
<i>was once a place Dolittle,
Lily and I called home.</i>

845
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:25,336
<i>Until the doctor</i>

846
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:30,341
<i>made an enemy of the island's
notorious ruler, King Rassouli.</i>

847
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:33,311
<i>And just our luck...
his most prized possession</i>

848
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:36,082
<i>was the very journal
we needed to steal.</i>

849
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:40,387
<i>So Dolittle needed a disguise.</i>

850
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:49,327
<i>While I was left watching
over the rest of the crew,</i>

851
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:53,066
<i>Dolittle and Stubbins
snuck into the palace.</i>

852
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:59,172
I'm about to die!

853
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:04,175
<i>Once inside, their path ended</i>

854
00:49:04,177 --> 00:49:06,911
<i>at a heavily bolted door,
naturally.</i>

855
00:49:06,913 --> 00:49:08,980
<i>But Dolittle still had</i>

856
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:12,016
<i>questionable contacts
on the island.</i>

857
00:49:12,018 --> 00:49:13,084
Hut, hut, hut,

858
00:49:13,086 --> 00:49:15,153
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...

859
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:17,121
The opening bid will suffice.

860
00:49:17,123 --> 00:49:18,956
You have my attention.

861
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:20,258
Don Carpenterino,

862
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,427
I'm here on behalf
of these humans.

863
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,228
They will pay you handsomely

864
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,498
for your family's
lock-picking skills.

865
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,366
You come to me for this,

866
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:30,935
on the day of
my daughter's wedding?

867
00:49:30,937 --> 00:49:32,937
Wait a minute.
Which daughter?

868
00:49:32,939 --> 00:49:34,939
It's not... Sh-Sheila?

869
00:49:34,941 --> 00:49:38,042
My Sheila?
She's getting married?

870
00:49:38,044 --> 00:49:40,978
- To a scorpion named Dylan.
- Sorry, Boy Scout.

871
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,982
I guess Sheila's
into bad boys now.

872
00:49:44,918 --> 00:49:47,285
We were gonna spend the rest
of our life spans together.

873
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:48,953
Move on, James.

874
00:49:48,955 --> 00:49:51,255
What's your human's best offer?

875
00:49:51,257 --> 00:49:52,990
Two more now...

876
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:54,926
and two later. Huh?

877
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:57,161
Okay.
You have yourself a deal.

878
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:59,397
See you around, Boy Scout.

879
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:01,299
Guys, I'm no Boy Scout.

880
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:05,069
Also, what's a scorpion got
that I don't got?

881
00:50:05,071 --> 00:50:07,372
- Besides a massive stinger.
- Get over her, James.

882
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:09,209
You dated for two weeks.

883
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:18,351
These bars are new.

884
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:21,052
Totally messing up my plan.

885
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:22,320
I can fit through them.

886
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:24,155
No, no, no.
It's too dangerous, man.

887
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:27,158
Can't go in there on your own.

888
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,193
Let me take him in, Doc.

889
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:31,497
I need something to distract me
from this Sheila reveal.

890
00:50:31,499 --> 00:50:34,232
Are you sure your head's
in the right place, James?

891
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:36,100
Oh, yeah.
I'll get the kid in

892
00:50:36,102 --> 00:50:37,736
and then fly headfirst
into a brick.

893
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:40,004
Just kidding. I'm fine.

894
00:50:40,006 --> 00:50:42,039
Aye. All right.

895
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,408
James will look after you.
It's fine.

896
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,209
Listen closely.

897
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:47,111
Get the journal
and get out of there.

898
00:50:47,113 --> 00:50:48,379
<i>Go through the room quietly.</i>

899
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:50,014
<i>Look for the tiger's eye.</i>

900
00:50:50,016 --> 00:50:51,315
<i>Go down the hidden staircase.</i>

901
00:50:51,317 --> 00:50:54,486
<i>And most importantly,
keep your disguise on.</i>

902
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:57,255
There's just one
little thing you should know.

903
00:50:57,257 --> 00:50:59,459
Rassouli loves his cats.

904
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:05,463
But that's no problem for us,

905
00:51:05,465 --> 00:51:08,299
'cause we can just fly
right over... Wait.

906
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:10,268
Uh, I see the mistake
I made here.

907
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,038
You can't fly.

908
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,549
Hey. Oh. Watch out.
Kitty cat on your six.

909
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,415
Oh, God.

910
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:25,517
Oh, oh! Whoa, whoa!

911
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,218
Hey!

912
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,022
Slick move, kid.

913
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:32,791
We make a pretty good team.

914
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:35,494
A real couple of bad boys.

915
00:51:35,496 --> 00:51:38,998
Okay, partner,
you know where to go.

916
00:52:00,654 --> 00:52:02,588
I'll keep watch on these lions.

917
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,823
That's what a bad boy
dragonfly does.

918
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:08,192
Would Dylan get
this close to a lion?

919
00:52:08,194 --> 00:52:10,261
Would he get this close?

920
00:52:10,263 --> 00:52:11,830
How about this close?

921
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:14,398
Oh, sh...

922
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,204
This is bad.
This is... very bad.

923
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:23,142
"Lily...

924
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:25,613
Dolittle."

925
00:52:33,687 --> 00:52:35,319
We got the journal! Open up!

926
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:36,488
Just kidding. He blew it.

927
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,523
- Bye!
- Oh, dear.

928
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:39,259
Stubbins.

929
00:52:43,196 --> 00:52:44,596
Former resident here.

930
00:52:44,598 --> 00:52:46,430
- Don't move.
- Huh?

931
00:52:46,432 --> 00:52:47,668
Don't touch.

932
00:52:52,873 --> 00:52:56,307
All I wanted was my daughter
to marry wisely,

933
00:52:56,309 --> 00:53:00,244
and instead, I got
the ringleader of a circus.

934
00:53:00,246 --> 00:53:03,549
I never understood
what Lily saw in you.

935
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:06,317
A common complaint
the world over

936
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,587
for fathers
of beloved daughters,

937
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:12,323
but in this instance,
I think we can all agree

938
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:15,529
it is particularly accurate.

939
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:21,100
Come here.

940
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:24,603
Come here. Come here.

941
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:26,738
Um, so,
you didn't mean any of that.

942
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,675
It was her journal.

943
00:53:29,677 --> 00:53:33,712
The only thing of hers
my men found in the wreckage.

944
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:37,150
It belongs here.

945
00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:43,722
All you had to do was
never show your face again

946
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:45,624
and even at that...

947
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:47,726
you failed.

948
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:52,231
Now you'll pay
for taking Lily away from me.

949
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:58,235
You knew what would happen
if you returned.

950
00:53:58,237 --> 00:53:59,907
Yes.

951
00:54:03,242 --> 00:54:05,242
Barry! Barry!

952
00:54:05,244 --> 00:54:08,680
Barry! Barry! Barry!

953
00:54:08,682 --> 00:54:12,718
Barry! Barry!
Barry! Barry!

954
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,486
You should go.

955
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:16,755
Come on, Barry!

956
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:19,457
It's my past that's caught up
with me, not yours.

957
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,560
- Yeah?
- But you're my friend.

958
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:23,463
Go. Don't look back.

959
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:34,271
You're better off
without him, kid.

960
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:37,408
Um... I'm in compliance.

961
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,410
Yes!

962
00:54:39,412 --> 00:54:40,812
Finally, some action down here.

963
00:54:40,814 --> 00:54:43,548
Boy, was it getting boring.
You know, Doc,

964
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,350
I hate to tell you, but you're
going down, my friend.

965
00:54:46,352 --> 00:54:48,319
You'd do well to keep
your buckteeth together.

966
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:49,488
What is that smell?

967
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:51,757
Hey, fellas,
I think Dr. Dolittle

968
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:54,291
did a little doo-doo.

969
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:56,260
Did Dr. Dolittle do
a little doo-doo?

970
00:54:56,262 --> 00:54:58,997
Perhaps when I'm out of here,
I'll teach you some manners

971
00:54:58,999 --> 00:55:01,566
and accept your lucky foot
as payment.

972
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:03,367
Oh, this lucky foot?

973
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:05,671
Don't worry about it, Doc,
'cause both of my lucky feet

974
00:55:05,673 --> 00:55:07,572
are gonna be tap-dancing
on your grave

975
00:55:07,574 --> 00:55:09,306
when my guy's done with you.

976
00:55:09,308 --> 00:55:11,810
Taking bets over here.

977
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,546
In the right corner,
wearing golden stripes,

978
00:55:14,548 --> 00:55:18,315
with a sparkling record
of 872 kills,

979
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:23,222
Barry "The Butcher" Bernstein!

980
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:31,630
Dr. Dolittle, remember me,

981
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,632
your old patient?

982
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:35,834
It's Barry.

983
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:37,468
Barry.

984
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,037
How could I forget you?

985
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:41,506
Oh, but you did, Doc.

986
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:44,308
We were just starting
to make progress,

987
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,612
and then you run off
with Rassouli's daughter

988
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:49,346
and abandon me.

989
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:51,550
Well, uh, I'm back now.

990
00:55:51,552 --> 00:55:53,721
Uh, perhaps we should just
pick up where we left off...

991
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,524
Enjoy the feast.

992
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:03,628
What will happen to Dolittle?

993
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,363
Oh. Well, he's a dead man.

994
00:56:06,365 --> 00:56:08,066
Yeah.

995
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:11,402
He'll think he can talk
his way out of it, but, uh,

996
00:56:11,404 --> 00:56:14,706
Barry has gone completely nuts.

997
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:19,443
But you...
you are one of us now.

998
00:56:19,445 --> 00:56:22,348
To Dolittle's death!

999
00:56:26,787 --> 00:56:29,490
- Psst.
- Hey, it's you.

1000
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:31,790
You made it.

1001
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,457
I need you to get a message

1002
00:56:33,459 --> 00:56:34,626
to my friends on our boat.

1003
00:56:34,628 --> 00:56:36,427
A message? Sure.

1004
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,797
When have I ever let you down?

1005
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,432
All I hear day after day is:

1006
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:44,803
"Oh, Barry,
you're such a disappointment.

1007
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:46,738
"Why can't you be
more like your brother?

1008
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,406
He eats poachers
for a living, you know."

1009
00:56:49,408 --> 00:56:52,611
"Yes, Mother, I know!

1010
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:55,281
The whole jungle knows."

1011
00:56:56,382 --> 00:56:57,448
Oh, my head.

1012
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,484
Your migraines are brought on

1013
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:01,486
by severe maternal issues

1014
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:02,888
and compounded
by sibling rivalry.

1015
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:06,423
Please make it stop.

1016
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:07,492
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1017
00:57:07,494 --> 00:57:09,528
- Lie down.
- Oh, my head.

1018
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:13,498
We could resume your treatment.

1019
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,634
Oh, the stress is unbearable.

1020
00:57:15,636 --> 00:57:18,703
I... I just want
to be a good boy.

1021
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:21,573
I just want
to make Mummy proud.

1022
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:22,841
There we are.

1023
00:57:22,843 --> 00:57:26,511
No one I eat
will ever be good enough.

1024
00:57:26,513 --> 00:57:29,413
There's the release.
Release it.

1025
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:32,551
I will never be good enough.

1026
00:57:32,553 --> 00:57:35,421
Unless I eat you.

1027
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:39,591
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1028
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:42,594
Because every mother
wants their son

1029
00:57:42,596 --> 00:57:45,163
to grow up and eat a doctor.

1030
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:46,700
You're a sick kitty.

1031
00:57:51,672 --> 00:57:53,605
Come here, Doc.
I'll make it quick.

1032
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:56,610
I've got another
one of these in an hour.

1033
00:57:57,945 --> 00:57:59,744
Give up, Dolittle.

1034
00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:01,012
You can't outsmart...

1035
00:58:01,014 --> 00:58:02,514
Oh, what was that?

1036
00:58:02,516 --> 00:58:03,682
Oh, wait.

1037
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:04,883
Now it's over there, huh?

1038
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:06,618
And now it's over here.

1039
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,553
Now it's back over there.
Got it.

1040
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:09,988
And now it's over here.

1041
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,890
Oh, I lost it.
I've got to get it.

1042
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,625
A cat is still a cat.

1043
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:15,629
- I got it.
- Easily distracted.

1044
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:18,563
New game, Doc.

1045
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:20,866
Get back down here.

1046
00:58:20,868 --> 00:58:22,636
Come on down, Doc.

1047
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:26,504
Okay, James,
you can't let this kid down.

1048
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:27,939
You got to deliver
this message.

1049
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:30,208
Oh, no. It's James.

1050
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:34,613
From now on, no more focusing
on relationships and...

1051
00:58:34,615 --> 00:58:36,581
Whoa. Poly?

1052
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,049
- Is that you?
- James?

1053
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:41,052
- Ooh, your feathers really filled out nice.
- James, James!

1054
00:58:41,054 --> 00:58:43,555
- What happened, James?
- Oh, right. Message.

1055
00:58:43,557 --> 00:58:44,823
My bad.

1056
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:46,558
The kid's been captured
by Rassouli,

1057
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,693
and Barry's about to have
Dolittle for lunch.

1058
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:50,695
Looks like we're going ashore
after all.

1059
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:52,966
Be a darling and grab
my dynamite, will you?

1060
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:59,037
We need to split up if
we're going to pull this off.

1061
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,906
Chee-Chee,
you're coming with me.

1062
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:02,908
Where are we going?
No, no, no, don't tell me.

1063
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,609
Just tell me when we get there.

1064
00:59:04,611 --> 00:59:07,612
<i>Yoshi, create a distraction.</i>

1065
00:59:07,614 --> 00:59:09,448
Hope this is enough.

1066
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:16,523
We are being attacked!

1067
00:59:22,796 --> 00:59:24,663
Come on down, Doc.

1068
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:25,931
Therapy's the answer.

1069
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:28,235
Oh, no.
Worse than I expected.

1070
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:35,640
- I got you, Doc.
- Back off, Barry!

1071
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:37,842
Poly, don't!

1072
00:59:37,844 --> 00:59:39,646
An appetizer.

1073
00:59:42,115 --> 00:59:43,250
I got you, Poly.

1074
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:48,653
Any final diagnosis, Doc?

1075
00:59:48,655 --> 00:59:50,689
Don't you want to be
the best Barry you could be?

1076
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:53,591
Oh, I'm about to.

1077
00:59:53,593 --> 00:59:55,963
I am not a prisoner of fear!

1078
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:01,700
I'm not a prisoner of fear?

1079
01:00:01,702 --> 01:00:03,001
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1080
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:04,836
It's okay to be scared.

1081
01:00:04,838 --> 01:00:06,606
- Ow, ow.
- Oh, oh!

1082
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:11,743
It's okay to be scared.

1083
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:13,647
- You should be scared.
- It's okay to be scared!

1084
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:17,983
- Give him a good hiding.
- Okay, we're doing this.

1085
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:19,818
We are doing this.

1086
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,722
We're not doing this.

1087
01:00:25,058 --> 01:00:27,892
Hit him in the low area.

1088
01:00:27,894 --> 01:00:30,595
Down there.

1089
01:00:30,597 --> 01:00:31,665
Ah.

1090
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:37,035
Ooh, that's got to hurt.

1091
01:00:37,037 --> 01:00:38,636
Ow! My Barry berries.

1092
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:39,606
That will work.

1093
01:00:41,608 --> 01:00:42,809
Cheap shot, ape.

1094
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:47,846
Wait. I...

1095
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:51,585
I haven't finished
my treatment.

1096
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:55,854
♪ Go to sleep, baby tiger ♪

1097
01:00:55,856 --> 01:00:58,792
♪ Time to put
those claws away. ♪

1098
01:00:59,926 --> 01:01:01,661
Anyway...

1099
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:05,130
You need this more than I do.

1100
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:08,166
Tell me I'm enough, Mummy.

1101
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:10,969
I had 50 grand riding on that.

1102
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:13,638
Well, I won't pay that.

1103
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,676
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner.

1104
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:20,614
Thanks for sticking
with me, Doc.

1105
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:44,769
I have it.

1106
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:47,174
- I have the j...
- Stop! - Halt!

1107
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,612
And now I'll have it.

1108
01:01:54,948 --> 01:01:56,049
Hmm.

1109
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,719
She had such a sure hand.

1110
01:02:01,721 --> 01:02:04,925
Exactly what
the doctor ordered.

1111
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:10,995
What did they offer you,
Mudfly,

1112
01:02:10,997 --> 01:02:12,732
to murder the queen of England?

1113
01:02:13,934 --> 01:02:15,934
Quite a few things, actually.

1114
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:17,202
Knighthood.

1115
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:18,937
Windward House.

1116
01:02:18,939 --> 01:02:20,705
Chair of the Royal College.

1117
01:02:20,707 --> 01:02:23,007
In no particular order.

1118
01:02:23,009 --> 01:02:26,044
Oh, and the icing
on the madeleine

1119
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:29,013
will be the scientific
accolades that accrue

1120
01:02:29,015 --> 01:02:32,183
from the proper study
of the Eden Tree.

1121
01:02:32,185 --> 01:02:34,953
All thanks to Lily Dolittle.

1122
01:02:34,955 --> 01:02:37,755
Actually, no,
that's still madeleine.

1123
01:02:37,757 --> 01:02:42,796
The icing is knowing
that you know I won.

1124
01:02:46,233 --> 01:02:50,468
Oh, and, Dolittle, I'm so sorry
for that hole in your boat.

1125
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:51,771
What hole?

1126
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:03,183
Abandon ship!
Everyone, overboard!

1127
01:03:07,787 --> 01:03:09,923
Oh, not good.

1128
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:16,696
Don't look back.

1129
01:03:18,064 --> 01:03:20,064
Help!

1130
01:03:20,066 --> 01:03:21,935
I'm on it, Doc.

1131
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:25,303
I can't fly.

1132
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:27,707
And I can't swim.

1133
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:33,811
Got you, buddy.

1134
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:35,280
Plimpton,
I'm not losing you, bro.

1135
01:03:35,282 --> 01:03:37,081
Step away from the light.

1136
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:38,316
There is no light.

1137
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:39,518
I'm alive.

1138
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,085
I'm alive.

1139
01:03:41,087 --> 01:03:45,125
I'm alive,
thanks to you, Yoshi.

1140
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:10,850
You've always been so kind.

1141
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:16,921
It's difficult to say goodbye.

1142
01:04:16,923 --> 01:04:19,958
Please don't say that.

1143
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,062
It's all right.

1144
01:04:25,332 --> 01:04:27,832
You've done your best.

1145
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:30,003
Your queen is proud.

1146
01:04:34,207 --> 01:04:37,010
Where are you, Dolittle?

1147
01:04:38,979 --> 01:04:41,312
Hey, big bird, you doing okay?

1148
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:43,047
No.

1149
01:04:43,049 --> 01:04:45,116
Nothing about me is okay.

1150
01:04:45,118 --> 01:04:47,318
My father was right about me.

1151
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,420
I should have been an omelet.

1152
01:04:49,422 --> 01:04:51,590
I know how you feel.

1153
01:04:51,592 --> 01:04:55,093
My dad said he was going out
for a pack of seals one night

1154
01:04:55,095 --> 01:04:57,596
and never came back.

1155
01:04:57,598 --> 01:05:00,965
I guess we got something
in common after all, Plimpton.

1156
01:05:00,967 --> 01:05:03,134
What is this feeling?

1157
01:05:03,136 --> 01:05:07,071
I'm all warm and fuzzy inside.

1158
01:05:07,073 --> 01:05:09,307
That's friendship, bro.

1159
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:10,842
Huh.

1160
01:05:10,844 --> 01:05:13,313
Not bad... bro.

1161
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:19,286
I'm not crying. You're crying.

1162
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:35,266
Right.
Gather round, shall we?

1163
01:05:35,268 --> 01:05:37,935
Huh? Let's have a look
where we are now.

1164
01:05:37,937 --> 01:05:39,806
That's the spirit, John.

1165
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:46,246
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1166
01:05:48,148 --> 01:05:49,215
I'm already getting duck bumps.

1167
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:54,986
- We are finished.
- What?

1168
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:56,087
Is this a pep talk?

1169
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:57,355
'Cause it's a weird one.

1170
01:05:57,357 --> 01:06:00,958
I can sniff defeat
like a truffle pig.

1171
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,960
This can't be the end.

1172
01:06:02,962 --> 01:06:04,429
- Yeah.
- We...

1173
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:06,431
- I smell it.
- We can still save the queen.

1174
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,234
- Nope.
- We can still save your house.

1175
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,970
I believe in you.

1176
01:06:12,972 --> 01:06:14,238
We can keep going.

1177
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,973
Oh, you got a point there.

1178
01:06:15,975 --> 01:06:17,208
Except the journal's gone,

1179
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:19,277
we have no way to find
the Eden Tree,

1180
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:20,512
and our boat is sunk.

1181
01:06:20,514 --> 01:06:22,382
He makes a strong argument.

1182
01:06:24,217 --> 01:06:27,151
On the plus side,
you are all cured.

1183
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:29,053
Chee-Chee, you are brave now.

1184
01:06:29,055 --> 01:06:31,356
Plimpton and Yoshi
are getting along.

1185
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:33,257
Ow! Remember, back! Back!

1186
01:06:33,259 --> 01:06:34,459
Sort of.

1187
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:36,260
And, Stubbins,
you've made friends,

1188
01:06:36,262 --> 01:06:38,129
and you can even talk to 'em.

1189
01:06:38,131 --> 01:06:39,931
You don't need me.

1190
01:06:39,933 --> 01:06:42,300
I'll stay here
and offer medical services

1191
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:45,136
to this island
of random bandits and outlaws.

1192
01:06:45,138 --> 01:06:46,404
The doctor's here!

1193
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:48,106
Seeking new patients.

1194
01:06:48,108 --> 01:06:50,007
- Cash only.
- Ladies, gentlemen,

1195
01:06:50,009 --> 01:06:51,710
who'd like to dance?

1196
01:06:51,712 --> 01:06:54,178
I got a bad case
of dancing fever.

1197
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,280
So, watch out, it's infectious.

1198
01:06:56,282 --> 01:06:57,949
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cha!

1199
01:06:57,951 --> 01:06:59,450
- Come on, Doc.
- Can't help him.

1200
01:06:59,452 --> 01:07:01,419
That explorer
you told me about...

1201
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:03,287
she would have never given up.

1202
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:05,256
She was your wife, wasn't she?

1203
01:07:05,258 --> 01:07:07,058
You want to know
the ironic bit?

1204
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,962
I don't know
what "ironic" means.

1205
01:07:10,964 --> 01:07:14,265
Irony is when you find a woman

1206
01:07:14,267 --> 01:07:15,567
and she makes your life
more wonderful

1207
01:07:15,569 --> 01:07:17,368
than it had any right to be,

1208
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:21,005
and then, poof, she's gone,
and it's all your fault.

1209
01:07:21,007 --> 01:07:25,044
This journey was my chance
to finish what she started.

1210
01:07:28,014 --> 01:07:30,448
Lily insisted I care
for the animals at home,

1211
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:32,984
so I stayed behind.

1212
01:07:32,986 --> 01:07:34,553
Rassouli's right.

1213
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,287
I should have been with her.

1214
01:07:36,289 --> 01:07:39,190
Now all I have left of her
is the ghost I see

1215
01:07:39,192 --> 01:07:41,058
when I hold our rings.

1216
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:43,229
So, you see her, too?

1217
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,437
Not only did you lose
my daughter's journal...

1218
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:55,339
...but your polar bear
blew up my village.

1219
01:07:55,341 --> 01:07:56,441
No.

1220
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:58,477
We don't know that.

1221
01:07:58,479 --> 01:08:03,047
And your gorilla
beat up my tiger.

1222
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:04,552
No good.

1223
01:08:08,354 --> 01:08:11,055
- Let's go.
- No, no. Stay.

1224
01:08:11,057 --> 01:08:12,258
No, no, no, no, no.

1225
01:08:13,426 --> 01:08:16,262
Mm. Yeah.

1226
01:08:21,468 --> 01:08:24,101
Irony...

1227
01:08:24,103 --> 01:08:27,539
is me wanting to kill you

1228
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:30,578
with every fiber of my being...

1229
01:08:33,514 --> 01:08:38,151
...but loving my daughter more.

1230
01:08:47,495 --> 01:08:49,329
I miss her, too.

1231
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:55,266
She would have wanted you to...

1232
01:08:55,268 --> 01:08:57,103
to keep going.

1233
01:09:05,144 --> 01:09:07,280
So!

1234
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:11,850
Get going...

1235
01:09:11,852 --> 01:09:14,187
before I stop feeling
sentimental.

1236
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:20,293
She's saying
we don't have a ship.

1237
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:23,595
Well, uh...

1238
01:09:23,597 --> 01:09:26,366
I have the perfect vessel
for you.

1239
01:09:29,168 --> 01:09:30,636
Bit of a fixer-upper.

1240
01:09:30,638 --> 01:09:32,704
It's got good bones.

1241
01:09:32,706 --> 01:09:33,772
At least it floats.

1242
01:09:33,774 --> 01:09:37,441
We'll just have to make
the best of it, won't we?

1243
01:09:37,443 --> 01:09:39,511
Ooh! Company.

1244
01:09:39,513 --> 01:09:41,513
Uh, who's that?

1245
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:42,881
Hi.

1246
01:09:42,883 --> 01:09:44,215
I'm Jeff.

1247
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:46,386
Crikey.

1248
01:09:48,522 --> 01:09:51,322
<i>If Lily's research was correct,</i>

1249
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:55,426
<i>then Mudfly was well on his way
to Eden Tree Island.</i>

1250
01:09:55,428 --> 01:09:58,462
<i>All we needed to do
was track Mudfly.</i>

1251
01:09:58,464 --> 01:10:00,298
But how do we do that?

1252
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,501
Whales, boyo.

1253
01:10:02,503 --> 01:10:04,470
Whales.

1254
01:10:20,621 --> 01:10:22,654
I can't believe
you're flipping him off.

1255
01:10:22,656 --> 01:10:25,224
I know.
That man has no chin.

1256
01:10:34,635 --> 01:10:36,235
Ah.

1257
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:56,356
We found him. Follow us.

1258
01:11:05,532 --> 01:11:07,735
Eden Tree Island.

1259
01:11:24,985 --> 01:11:26,785
- Yeah!
- Oh, wow.

1260
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:30,456
- Wow.
- Extraordinary.

1261
01:11:44,538 --> 01:11:46,437
This must be it.

1262
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:51,743
The map points us directly into
the center of this mountain.

1263
01:11:51,745 --> 01:11:53,612
Don't look down.

1264
01:11:53,614 --> 01:11:55,681
Let's keep our beaks up,
shall we?

1265
01:11:55,683 --> 01:11:57,248
Trying to stay positive.

1266
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,684
What the heck
are we doing up here?

1267
01:11:58,686 --> 01:12:01,553
Going in the back way,
my feathered buddy.

1268
01:12:01,555 --> 01:12:03,320
What are you complaining about?

1269
01:12:03,322 --> 01:12:05,456
This is the widest branch
I've ever scurried on.

1270
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:06,758
Don't look down.

1271
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,560
Look at me.

1272
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:10,562
Whoa.

1273
01:12:10,564 --> 01:12:13,199
A big cave.

1274
01:12:17,738 --> 01:12:19,504
Stay close. Keep quiet.

1275
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:21,305
Kevin's log, day 12.

1276
01:12:21,307 --> 01:12:22,741
Some force
beyond my comprehension

1277
01:12:22,743 --> 01:12:25,610
still compels me to follow
this crew of lunatics,

1278
01:12:25,612 --> 01:12:28,345
the squirrel killer
and their deranged leader.

1279
01:12:28,347 --> 01:12:30,849
Perhaps it's the magic tree
that draws me.

1280
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:32,751
- Rifle troop! Fall in!
- Hide. They're close.

1281
01:12:32,753 --> 01:12:35,522
Turn it down now. Stay down.

1282
01:12:45,866 --> 01:12:48,334
Fox fire fungus.

1283
01:12:49,402 --> 01:12:51,304
We must be near it now.

1284
01:12:53,774 --> 01:12:55,774
Look, Doc.

1285
01:12:55,776 --> 01:12:57,843
It's lighting a path
all the way...

1286
01:12:57,845 --> 01:13:00,377
to the man who wants us dead.

1287
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:02,379
Stay right there.

1288
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:04,315
Oh.

1289
01:13:04,317 --> 01:13:06,520
Go on, then, soldier boy.
Spoil yourself.

1290
01:13:11,357 --> 01:13:13,627
Hello, Blair.

1291
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:16,728
Get over there!

1292
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,632
Looking for a tree, is it?

1293
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,667
Trees don't often grow
in caves.

1294
01:13:22,669 --> 01:13:24,435
Didn't you pay attention
in botany class?

1295
01:13:24,437 --> 01:13:27,541
No, but pay attention
to this, Dolittle.

1296
01:13:28,809 --> 01:13:31,408
I beat you.

1297
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:34,546
You filthy animal...

1298
01:13:34,548 --> 01:13:35,947
Move it. Come on, beasts.

1299
01:13:35,949 --> 01:13:38,451
...hoarder!

1300
01:13:40,687 --> 01:13:42,654
So...

1301
01:13:42,656 --> 01:13:44,388
where is it?

1302
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,692
Where's what?

1303
01:13:46,894 --> 01:13:48,560
The Eden Tree.

1304
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:51,830
Truth is, I haven't got a clue.

1305
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:53,364
Don't be ridiculous.

1306
01:13:53,366 --> 01:13:54,766
You're John Dolittle.

1307
01:13:54,768 --> 01:13:57,368
You get everything you want.

1308
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:58,839
Not today, I don't.

1309
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:03,675
You really don't have
any idea, do you?

1310
01:14:03,677 --> 01:14:06,845
How does ignorance feel?

1311
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:08,847
Oh.

1312
01:14:08,849 --> 01:14:11,448
Well, very freeing, actually.

1313
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:14,586
One must hug uncertainty,
don't you think?

1314
01:14:14,588 --> 01:14:16,824
That's how Lily lived her life.

1315
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:20,692
Embrace the unknown, and...

1316
01:14:20,694 --> 01:14:23,595
the answers will be revealed.

1317
01:14:23,597 --> 01:14:27,699
You sad, misguided nut,
Dolittle.

1318
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:29,335
Give that to me.
Give me that.

1319
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:35,574
I will find this damn tree
on my own,

1320
01:14:35,576 --> 01:14:39,580
and by God,
history will remember me.

1321
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:53,727
Yeah. Something interesting
going on now.

1322
01:14:58,999 --> 01:15:02,468
My God, that feels
a lot larger than all of us.

1323
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,638
Let's go!

1324
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,742
- What is that?
- Something's moving!

1325
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:11,444
Look out!

1326
01:15:15,616 --> 01:15:18,650
Retreat!

1327
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:20,218
Down over here!

1328
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,654
The lot of you! Come on!

1329
01:15:22,656 --> 01:15:24,758
Yoshi, stay down.

1330
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:27,458
He saved me.

1331
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,527
I have a second chance

1332
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:33,800
to live a life of-of kindness
and-and-and generosity and...

1333
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:40,572
Take him, not me!

1334
01:15:40,574 --> 01:15:42,676
I'm a good person now.

1335
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
Tell you what we're gonna do...
we're gonna make a run

1336
01:16:08,802 --> 01:16:09,836
for that ditch
while she's distracted...

1337
01:16:11,838 --> 01:16:13,538
- Yoshi!
- Get this off of me!

1338
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:14,572
Cheech.

1339
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:16,074
Help me! Plimpton!

1340
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:17,776
I'll save you, bro.

1341
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:19,644
Right. Think fast. Uh...

1342
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:22,582
Get this off of me!

1343
01:16:24,117 --> 01:16:25,886
This will likely
upset her a bit.

1344
01:16:27,854 --> 01:16:29,521
No! Doc!

1345
01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:31,056
- No! - No!
- John!

1346
01:16:31,058 --> 01:16:33,694
Dolittle!

1347
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,872
Dolittle!

1348
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:49,109
Help!

1349
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:02,823
Is he speaking dragon?

1350
01:17:04,858 --> 01:17:09,861
You may be able
to speak my language,

1351
01:17:09,863 --> 01:17:14,165
but that does not make you
worthy of the fruit.

1352
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:16,835
I know protecting the tree's
your duty,

1353
01:17:16,837 --> 01:17:19,738
but you won't be able
to continue much longer...

1354
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,172
considering
the damage you've taken

1355
01:17:21,174 --> 01:17:22,874
and the pain you're in.

1356
01:17:22,876 --> 01:17:27,981
Oh, you know
nothing of my pain.

1357
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,819
But I do.

1358
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:36,955
I've felt it as well.

1359
01:17:36,957 --> 01:17:39,858
The kind that doesn't come
from a bullet or a blade,

1360
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,595
but cuts much deeper.

1361
01:17:42,929 --> 01:17:45,797
And now in every moment
and every movement,

1362
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:47,799
you feel that pain again.

1363
01:17:47,801 --> 01:17:49,836
Yeah?

1364
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,575
It's hard to carry on...

1365
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:02,682
...when you've lost
the one you love.

1366
01:18:16,696 --> 01:18:19,833
Just leave!

1367
01:18:26,807 --> 01:18:28,706
Uh, what just happened?

1368
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,175
Oh, broken hearts.

1369
01:18:30,177 --> 01:18:31,843
What the heck
are you doing here?

1370
01:18:31,845 --> 01:18:33,044
Don't worry, guys.
I got this.

1371
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:34,779
We're both dragons.

1372
01:18:34,781 --> 01:18:38,016
Hey, just wondering,
you know, dragon to dragon,

1373
01:18:38,018 --> 01:18:39,717
if you wouldn't mind
telling me where...

1374
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:41,953
Ow, ow, ow!
She's really mad.

1375
01:18:41,955 --> 01:18:44,255
I'll wait for
whoever survives outside.

1376
01:18:44,257 --> 01:18:47,258
John, let's just get
out of here while we still can.

1377
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,960
No.

1378
01:18:48,962 --> 01:18:50,764
I think we're here to help her.

1379
01:18:53,133 --> 01:18:54,933
Yeah.

1380
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:57,102
- We haven't got much time.
- Hmm?

1381
01:18:57,104 --> 01:19:00,207
I-I imagine
it's a bit tender here.

1382
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:03,741
Oh...

1383
01:19:03,743 --> 01:19:06,144
I'm unarmed.

1384
01:19:06,146 --> 01:19:08,746
I pose no threat to you.

1385
01:19:08,748 --> 01:19:10,748
The emotional stress
over the years

1386
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,016
has done damage
to your stomach.

1387
01:19:12,018 --> 01:19:14,018
Get away from me.

1388
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:16,855
You have a severe
impaction of the colon,

1389
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:19,791
and if I don't manually
fragment it, it'll go septic.

1390
01:19:19,793 --> 01:19:22,794
You won't be able to protect
anything anymore.

1391
01:19:22,796 --> 01:19:26,164
Ooh, that sounds like
some tummy ache.

1392
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:27,999
Tell you what,
give us five minutes.

1393
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:30,268
If you don't feel better,
you can fry us all.

1394
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:32,203
Stop talking.

1395
01:19:32,205 --> 01:19:35,140
Just get on with it.

1396
01:19:35,142 --> 01:19:37,942
We have to get you
on your side.

1397
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:40,178
We need to perform
an emergency extraction.

1398
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,213
Extraction?
Uh, what are we pulling out?

1399
01:19:42,215 --> 01:19:44,916
- Go get 'em, gang.
- Got your back, Doc.

1400
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:47,051
It's showtime.

1401
01:19:47,053 --> 01:19:49,120
Three, two, one.

1402
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:50,991
Turn.

1403
01:19:52,493 --> 01:19:54,325
Chee-Chee,
chuck me the forceps.

1404
01:19:54,327 --> 01:19:57,028
Knew it would come in handy.
Told you!

1405
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:58,329
Everybody knows what to do.

1406
01:19:58,331 --> 01:20:00,131
Just breathe. Works for me.

1407
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:02,767
It's okay. Just hold on
to my wing, sweetie.

1408
01:20:02,769 --> 01:20:03,935
Dab-Dab's here.

1409
01:20:03,937 --> 01:20:04,969
Oi.

1410
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:06,037
You are my apprentice.

1411
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:07,774
You keep her calm.

1412
01:20:09,776 --> 01:20:13,011
Did you know the leek is
the national emblem of Wales?

1413
01:20:13,013 --> 01:20:14,812
And very useful it is, too.

1414
01:20:14,814 --> 01:20:16,814
You might feel
a bit of pressure.

1415
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:18,818
I got her.

1416
01:20:20,287 --> 01:20:21,920
Oh, good heavens!

1417
01:20:21,922 --> 01:20:23,087
Oh, no, you didn't.

1418
01:20:23,089 --> 01:20:24,956
Oh, my gosh!

1419
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:26,858
Just clearing the way.

1420
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:29,027
Is that armor?

1421
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:31,698
You got the whole
Spanish army in here.

1422
01:20:33,233 --> 01:20:34,365
Give us a deep breath.

1423
01:20:34,367 --> 01:20:35,900
Hold it.

1424
01:20:35,902 --> 01:20:36,968
Word of warning.

1425
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,069
What's up, Doc?

1426
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:39,837
When removing the blockage...

1427
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:41,206
Yoshi, now.

1428
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:44,244
...there may be an initial
release of wind.

1429
01:20:51,017 --> 01:20:53,384
Ach-ah-vee!

1430
01:20:53,386 --> 01:20:54,953
Respect.

1431
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:56,888
It's all right.
Nobody heard that.

1432
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:59,057
Nothing to be ashamed of.

1433
01:20:59,059 --> 01:21:00,391
We all do it.

1434
01:21:00,393 --> 01:21:02,561
We're all animals.

1435
01:21:02,563 --> 01:21:04,563
I can taste it!

1436
01:21:04,565 --> 01:21:06,164
- Okay, I'm back.
- Right.

1437
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:08,366
What did I miss? Oh, my gosh!

1438
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:10,168
This is the big one.

1439
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,869
We're in the homestretch now.

1440
01:21:11,871 --> 01:21:13,004
Cheech, get behind me.

1441
01:21:13,006 --> 01:21:14,339
I'm with you, Doc.
On your call.

1442
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:16,042
Heave!

1443
01:21:18,245 --> 01:21:20,144
Oh, it's breaching.

1444
01:21:20,146 --> 01:21:22,880
Blood rushing to my head.
Everything turning red.

1445
01:21:22,882 --> 01:21:25,252
One last push, madam,
if you please.

1446
01:21:38,064 --> 01:21:39,567
Thank you.

1447
01:21:41,134 --> 01:21:42,233
We did it.

1448
01:21:42,235 --> 01:21:43,870
Teamwork makes the dream work.

1449
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:48,108
That was a lot,
but we did good.

1450
01:21:51,911 --> 01:21:53,411
To put it simply,

1451
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:56,983
more leafy greens
and less armor in your diet.

1452
01:21:58,451 --> 01:22:03,388
I've seen armies of every kind,
but nothing like you.

1453
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:08,059
What unites
such a group of creatures?

1454
01:22:08,061 --> 01:22:12,196
Well, we may not look it,
right, but somehow...

1455
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:15,066
- Who's a good boy? Good boy.
- ...we just belong together.

1456
01:22:15,068 --> 01:22:18,371
Now let me help you.

1457
01:22:35,889 --> 01:22:37,922
Lily would have loved it, John.

1458
01:22:37,924 --> 01:22:40,191
We would never have found it
without her.

1459
01:22:40,193 --> 01:22:44,831
Wow. I just got the chills,
and I'm not even cold.

1460
01:23:09,122 --> 01:23:12,058
Thank you for showing me
the way, my love.

1461
01:23:18,431 --> 01:23:20,231
We know, O Lord, that there is

1462
01:23:20,233 --> 01:23:23,000
no word impossible to thee;

1463
01:23:23,002 --> 01:23:27,171
and that, if thou wilst,
thou canst yet raise her up

1464
01:23:27,173 --> 01:23:30,408
and restore her to a longer
continuance amongst us.

1465
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:33,244
O Father of mercies
and Lord of all comfort...

1466
01:23:33,246 --> 01:23:36,147
I'm sorry we couldn't save you,
Your Majesty.

1467
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:38,486
...her disillusion
draweth near.

1468
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:43,087
It is with great sadness...

1469
01:23:43,089 --> 01:23:44,455
Wait a minute.
I smell something.

1470
01:23:44,457 --> 01:23:46,059
It smells like...

1471
01:23:49,262 --> 01:23:50,128
Hope.

1472
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:52,031
...that I have to announce...

1473
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:55,333
...that the queen is no more.

1474
01:23:55,335 --> 01:23:57,435
Somebody call a doctor?

1475
01:23:57,437 --> 01:23:59,437
My mates!
A very dramatic entrance, boys.

1476
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:01,172
Well played.

1477
01:24:01,174 --> 01:24:03,207
- We've arrived.
- Dolittle!

1478
01:24:03,209 --> 01:24:05,145
Clear a path.
There isn't a moment to waste.

1479
01:24:09,115 --> 01:24:12,283
I have procured that which
is said to not exist.

1480
01:24:12,285 --> 01:24:15,155
Behold, the fruit
of the Eden Tree.

1481
01:24:17,257 --> 01:24:19,491
I said clear a path.

1482
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:21,060
Seize them!

1483
01:24:22,362 --> 01:24:24,397
Sorry but... sorry.

1484
01:24:28,301 --> 01:24:30,336
I got him!

1485
01:24:32,205 --> 01:24:34,174
- Go.
- Seize them!

1486
01:24:35,442 --> 01:24:37,177
You were born for this moment.

1487
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:39,245
I born.

1488
01:24:41,114 --> 01:24:42,581
Mini, take flight.

1489
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:44,382
Get him!

1490
01:24:44,384 --> 01:24:45,416
Freeze!

1491
01:24:45,418 --> 01:24:47,454
Go, go, go!

1492
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:51,124
No.

1493
01:24:53,326 --> 01:24:54,260
No, no, no, no!

1494
01:25:36,469 --> 01:25:39,103
Kevin's log, day unknown.

1495
01:25:39,105 --> 01:25:40,572
The killing has ended.

1496
01:25:40,574 --> 01:25:42,406
Let there be life.

1497
01:25:42,408 --> 01:25:44,277
Lady Rose.

1498
01:25:46,547 --> 01:25:50,414
Is there a giraffe
in my bedchamber?

1499
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,149
Yes. Oh, yes.

1500
01:25:52,151 --> 01:25:55,152
And a polar bear
and a gorilla and a parrot

1501
01:25:55,154 --> 01:25:57,056
and a duck, an ostrich.

1502
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:04,161
Our humble thanks be to God.

1503
01:26:04,163 --> 01:26:07,231
And well done, Dr. Dolittle.

1504
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:10,167
Not quite done, are we?

1505
01:26:10,169 --> 01:26:12,671
Interesting.
Carry on, Styx. I'm all ears.

1506
01:26:12,673 --> 01:26:14,640
What's that?

1507
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:17,141
Uh, Styx here agreed
to stay behind,

1508
01:26:17,143 --> 01:26:18,610
keep his 12 eyes on things.

1509
01:26:18,612 --> 01:26:20,612
He's just catching me up.

1510
01:26:20,614 --> 01:26:22,246
Like all leaf insects,

1511
01:26:22,248 --> 01:26:24,448
he speaks in
eight-syllable phrases,

1512
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:27,118
and he states...

1513
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,588
"Lord Badgley
did poison the queen."

1514
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:31,422
What? He did?

1515
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:34,526
Really,
Dolittle, this is too much.

1516
01:26:34,528 --> 01:26:35,561
You're certain?

1517
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:37,729
Well, this would be the time.

1518
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:41,633
No. I'm sorry.
Styx is quite adamant.

1519
01:26:41,635 --> 01:26:45,704
"In his right pocket,
the vial."

1520
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:47,405
Ugh, that's only seven.

1521
01:26:47,407 --> 01:26:49,373
Oh, "in his right pocket,

1522
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,342
the vial of
deathly nightshade."

1523
01:26:51,344 --> 01:26:53,478
Let's have a look, shall we?

1524
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,212
You can't possibly believe

1525
01:26:55,214 --> 01:26:58,449
that he's talking to an insect.

1526
01:26:58,451 --> 01:27:00,217
Well, I've...

1527
01:27:00,219 --> 01:27:02,621
I've spoken to ladybugs.

1528
01:27:02,623 --> 01:27:05,423
Making a wish
before they fly away.

1529
01:27:05,425 --> 01:27:07,193
Let's have a look.

1530
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:12,198
Ooh.

1531
01:27:16,637 --> 01:27:18,369
No one messes with my family.

1532
01:27:18,371 --> 01:27:20,739
Take one more step, and I'll
rip you a brand-new a...

1533
01:27:20,741 --> 01:27:22,509
Come on.

1534
01:27:23,777 --> 01:27:25,409
Get...

1535
01:27:25,411 --> 01:27:26,680
Hah.

1536
01:27:28,281 --> 01:27:30,247
To the Tower with him.

1537
01:27:30,249 --> 01:27:33,451
Oh, someone's been a bad boy.

1538
01:27:33,453 --> 01:27:35,252
Come on.

1539
01:27:35,254 --> 01:27:37,489
And I don't know why
you're all standing there.

1540
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:39,625
Nobody's died.
Leave me in peace.

1541
01:27:39,627 --> 01:27:41,425
You, too.

1542
01:27:41,427 --> 01:27:42,663
Your Majesty.

1543
01:27:43,697 --> 01:27:46,199
Not you, Dr. Dolittle.

1544
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,268
A moment, if you would, please.

1545
01:27:51,505 --> 01:27:54,438
Lady Rose, who is this person,
and why is he staring at me?

1546
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,175
He's Stubbins.

1547
01:27:57,443 --> 01:28:00,244
I-I want to be
an animal doctor.

1548
01:28:00,246 --> 01:28:02,181
He saved your life.

1549
01:28:13,694 --> 01:28:15,393
Thank you.

1550
01:28:15,395 --> 01:28:17,263
It's good to have you back,
Doctor.

1551
01:28:22,002 --> 01:28:22,934
Poly.

1552
01:28:22,936 --> 01:28:25,504
Anything
you'd like to say to me?

1553
01:28:25,506 --> 01:28:26,805
Aye, you were right.

1554
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:29,340
I suppose it is nice
to get out of the house

1555
01:28:29,342 --> 01:28:30,609
every once in a while.

1556
01:28:30,611 --> 01:28:32,243
Stubbins, Mini.

1557
01:28:32,245 --> 01:28:35,281
Enough. We have far less
important places to be.

1558
01:28:44,323 --> 01:28:47,458
<i>Our story ends
the way it began.</i>

1559
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,327
I have a letter
for Dr. Dolittle!

1560
01:28:50,329 --> 01:28:51,496
Somebody get me down!

1561
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:52,764
<i>Mostly.</i>

1562
01:28:52,766 --> 01:28:55,703
<i>There once was
a peculiar doctor...</i>

1563
01:28:58,471 --> 01:29:01,740
<i>...who found he was
at his best when sharing</i>

1564
01:29:01,742 --> 01:29:04,308
<i>his extraordinary ability...</i>

1565
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:06,645
- <i>...with others.</i>
- Excellent.

1566
01:29:06,647 --> 01:29:09,815
<i>Soon, Dr. Dolittle
reopened his gates,</i>

1567
01:29:09,817 --> 01:29:12,818
<i>as Lily would have wanted.</i>

1568
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:15,453
Three more in the queue, gang.

1569
01:29:15,455 --> 01:29:17,622
Copy that.

1570
01:29:17,624 --> 01:29:20,828
<i>Dolittle discovered his
place in the world once again.</i>

1571
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:31,636
<i>After all,
it's only by helping others</i>

1572
01:29:31,638 --> 01:29:34,708
<i>that we can truly
help ourselves.</i>

you're wondering...</i>

1575
01:32:42,562 --> 01:32:44,696
Psst.

1576

You bats.

1577
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:48,967
Show me the way out of here.

1578
01:32:48,969 --> 01:32:50,604
Psst.

1579
01:32:51,939 --> 01:32:53,774
Bing.

1580
01:32:56,576 --> 01:32:59,012
You understand me.

1581
01:33:01,882 --> 01:33:03,951
No, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
