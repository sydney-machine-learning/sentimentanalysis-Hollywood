Directed by Ning Hao

2
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:58,925
A BEIJING GOOD PERSON

3
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,299
Sir, please stop sending
us disposable slippers.

4
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,799
Those are employee benefits from my hotel,
they are free.

5
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,924
You've been consulting with me
for two years,like I said,

6
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,424
you can be a part-time taxi driver
anytime as long as you buy a car.

7
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,799
Sure, I'm just telling you now

8
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,549
I've saved enough money for the car.

9
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,049
Well, good for you.

10
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,174
And I'm prepared to become
a fancy chauffeur.

11
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,674
I just need your approval.

12
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:26,383
Bring your car and get the paperwork
done then.

13
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,258
Just a sec.

14
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,674
I didn't order food.

15
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:34,549
I did, Erdan.

16
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,674
-- Who are you?
-- I'm your cousin.

17
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:39,258
Cousin?

18
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:44,799
Come on in. It's alright.

19
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,183
-- You're all grown up.
-- You're painting walls?

20
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,424
I felt it.

21
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:58,550
About the size of an egg.

22
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,549
If I had had it removed when it was

23
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,799
much smaller,

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,799
it would cost me 20 thousand, at tops.

25
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,008
Now, since it involves vascular
penetration,

26
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:11,383
the procedure will cost 70 to 80 thousand.

27
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,925
I heard that

28
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,050
thyroid tumors are not lethal.

29
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,299
Maybe the tumor won't kill me

30
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
but the money sure will.

31
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,049
You don't say.

32
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,383
It's about the cost of a car.

33
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,883
Erdan, you're buying a car?

34
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,175
I was just browsing randomly.

35
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,175
I thought you were gonna make a withdrawal.

36
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,258
I was cleaning things up. It's expired.

37
00:03:58,175 --> 00:03:59,674
Erdan.

38
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:02,799
I haven't come visit you
since I came to Beijing.

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,608
And here on my first visit,
I'm borrowing money from you.

40
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,299
You don't have to come visit.

41
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,508
I'm fine.

42
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,008
Zhang Beijing, time to take
your medication.

43
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:23,799
Zhang Beijing, time to take
your medication.

44
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,424
What are you taking medicine for?

45
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:27,049
Same old problem.

46
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,133
Hypertension.

47
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:30,174
It must've cost you a lot.

48
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:33,175
I have state health insurance,
my employer paid for it.

49
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,799
Sorry I wasn't much of a help.

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,674
-- Take this with you.
-- No, no, no.

51
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,424
I came to ask you for a favor,
how could I take your stuff?

52
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,008
-- It's not right.
-- Please, it's the least I can do.

53
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,424
Okay, then...oh, I almost forgot.

54
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:47,758
This is for you.

55
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:50,924
It was your favorite. When we
were kids, we used to

56
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,008
fight over this,

57
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,633
and you made me cry every time.

58
00:04:56,675 --> 00:05:00,000
Erdan, this hypertension thing.
You should take it more seriously.

59
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,425
Beijing is such a huge city.

60
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,674
Who knows when we will meet again?

61
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:07,424
You're not crying, are you?

62
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,174
We can see each other anytime.

63
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,174
I'm alright. It's the damn tumor.

64
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:12,799
It gets me edgy.

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,299
Cheer up, we'll figure something out.

66
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,799
Okay..

67
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,049
You should go back now. I'm out of here.

68
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,208
-- Take care.
-- Sure.

69
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,174
Hello, sir.

70
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:30,174
Could you please wait a bit longer?

71
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:31,925
I'm running a little late.

72
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:35,550
Please don't give me a bad review.

73
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,924
Son, I heard this ride-hailing thing
pays a lot, eh?

74
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:48,608
It's not bad. Thanks.

75
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:53,508
What a wonderful young man.

76
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,675
That'll work.

77
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:19,175
Yeah.

78
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,933
-- Is it open?
-- Yes.

79
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:35,049
Is it open?

80
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,175
Yes.

81
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,883
Because of the card or you?

82
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,924
The card.

83
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:42,549
A clean shave,

84
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,799
and you'll look just like me.

85
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,549
-- Not really.
-- You're my cousin.

86
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,133
Of course you do.

87
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,049
Erdan.

88
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,549
I've never lied to get anything.

89
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,008
I don't think I can do this.

90
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,799
State health insurance is a social benefit.

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,674
It doesn't matter who benefits from it.

92
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,549
Your disease is my disease.

93
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,674
And my card is your card.

94
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:03,300
It'll work.

95
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,008
No.42, Ma Ke, please go to
consulting room 226.

96
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:29,133
No.42, Ma Ke, please go to
consulting room 226.

97
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,758
No.42, Ma Ke, please go to
consulting room 226.

98
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:25,049
No.48, Zhang Beijing, please go
to consulting room 225.

99
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,299
No.48, Zhang Beijing, please go
to consulting room 225.

100
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,925
Is No.48, Zhang Beijing, here?

101
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,925
Is Zhang Beijing here?

102
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,258
Hey, bro, is that you?

103
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,175
Are you Zhang Beijing?

104
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,133
Yeah.

105
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,258
This way.

106
00:08:58,175 --> 00:08:59,383
Hold on.

107
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:05,549
Come back here.

108
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,800
Come back.

109
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,050
Is that yours?

110
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
That.

111
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,674
No.49, Jia Tianlong,

112
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,383
please go to consulting room 229.

113
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,549
No.49, Jia Tianlong,

114
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,174
please go to consulting room 229.

115
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:42,883
Swallow.

116
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,299
Do you always sweat like this?

117
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,174
It's the disease.

118
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:50,674
Where are you from?

119
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,174
Bei…

120
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,299
Beijing.

121
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,049
I live in Xili Complex, Hujialou Street,

122
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,133
apartment 7-8.

123
00:09:58,175 --> 00:10:00,008
Why are you lying to me?

124
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,549
What makes you say that?

125
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,049
The accent.

126
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,799
You're obviously from Hengshui.

127
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,049
So am I, and…

128
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,708
wherever we go, bro, we must
not forget where we are from.

129
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,924
You need surgery ASAP.

130
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,299
Go do a blood test first.

131
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,508
Sure.

132
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:21,049
Are you paying cash

133
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,758
or do you have health insurance?

134
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:24,383
Insurance.

135
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,425
Your card, please.

136
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:31,883
Where's my card?

137
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,049
Maybe I should come another day.

138
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,674
Wait.

139
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:37,633
What's that in your hand?

140
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,883
You're looking for the card
while holding it?

141
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,383
It's all soaked in your sweat.

142
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:49,674
If I didn't know you have the tumor

143
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:52,258
I'd say you're using someone else's card.

144
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,633
Zhang Beijing.

145
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,174
You're from Hengshui, bro,

146
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,424
why is your name Zhang Beijing?

147
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:08,924
It should be Zhang Hengshui.

148
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:10,258
Right?

149
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,008
Here.

150
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:15,924
-- What's wrong with your neck?
-- Nothing, it's just numb.

151
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,799
You sure are one interesting fella.

152
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,299
Come here, let me take a look.

153
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,858
-- Turn around.
-- Doctor Cao!

154
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,924
I've found you finally.

155
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:26,299
You gave me a second life.

156
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,174
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else. I'm not Doctor Cao.

157
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:31,049
My name is Ning.

158
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,299
I'm thankful anyway, Doctor Ning.

159
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,299
You, doc, are also a life-saver.

160
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,299
You know what? Keep up
the good work here.

161
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,008
I'll go thank Doctor Cao now.

162
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,049
I was looking all over for you,
what happened?

163
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,549
I'm not cut out for this.

164
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,299
Let's just forget it.

165
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,299
Man, you're such a wuss.

166
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,674
You tumor must be bigger than your balls.

167
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,799
You've done well so far.

168
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,424
Now it's just a blood test,

169
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:05,424
which requires no use of the card.

170
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,674
As long as they don't see it,

171
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:07,924
who knows which is you

172
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,299
and which is me?

173
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,675
Zhang Beijing!

174
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:14,674
Lingzi? What are you doing here?

175
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,549
I work here.

176
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,674
Why are you here?

177
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,799
I came for a checkup, with a relative.

178
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,799
The doctor told to me to get a blood test.

179
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,674
Great, you're all mine now.

180
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:26,133
Follow me.

181
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:28,924
Hurry up.

182
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:30,424
Patients trust us with their lives.

183
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:32,049
The hospital shall repay them
with love and care.

184
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,883
Your disease is my disease.

185
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,150
-- Let me see the order.
-- Order.

186
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,924
Why are you examined for this?

187
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,799
What's wrong with your thyroid?

188
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,508
There's a tumor.

189
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,675
No worries.

190
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:50,383
You'll live.

191
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:11,633
What are you guys doing?

192
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,674
It's hunger.

193
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:14,924
Gets me dizzy.

194
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:16,425
Help me sit down.

195
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,133
You must have hyperthyroidism, too.

196
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,800
Look how your hand shivers.

197
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,425
Stop it.

198
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,883
Stop it now.

199
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:36,549
You did like using needles on me
when we were in school.

200
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,633
I got nervous every time I saw you.

201
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:41,258
That's bullshit.

202
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:43,924
Always joking around.

203
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:45,425
You haven't changed a bit.

204
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,799
But your hand sure has.

205
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,174
You're damn right.

206
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:51,174
What's your skin-care secret?

207
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:53,424
I look like I could be your dad.

208
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:54,924
Cut it out.

209
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,008
Make a fist.

210
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:57,883
Make a fist.

211
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:01,883
Let me make a fist.

212
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,883
I see you're still mocking me.

213
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,508
Now this is gonna sting.

214
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,174
I stung him, what are you groaning for?

215
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:16,633
He has blood phobia.

216
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,549
You are good.

217
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,883
That didn't hurt at all.

218
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:26,549
Maybe this is the way it should be

219
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,424
Don't wait till you're an old man

220
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:34,050
To start seeking the freedom you want

221
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,049
Thanks, boss.

222
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,133
Erdan.

223
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,049
You're the man.

224
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,633
I applaud you.

225
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,033
Just like that, you pulled
this whole thing off.

226
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,508
You're a natural, man.

227
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:51,675
You should be a movie star.

228
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,924
Once,

229
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,174
Zhang Yimou

230
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:57,050
came to our hotel to shoot a scene

231
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,799
and he insisted that I should be an extra.

232
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,008
I…

233
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:05,050
Turned it down.

234
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,424
Acting…

235
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:11,008
is all about emancipating your true nature.

236
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,299
And that, my friend

237
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,383
simply means

238
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:18,299
being reckless and shameless.

239
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,674
True story.

240
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:22,258
You were always the
most shameless man in the village.

241
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,424
You don't even blush when lying.

242
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,008
Here, let's drink to you.

243
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,383
Like you said, I'm a natural.

244
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,050
Now, the first half

245
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:38,508
was a complete success.

246
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:41,424
As for the second half,
the surgery part,

247
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:43,050
I can't do that for you.

248
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,799
But what if I screw up?

249
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,058
You screw up and my
health insurance is gone.

250
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:52,674
That's why you need…

251
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:53,799
practice.

252
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,299
Emancipate your true nature.

253
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,674
How?

254
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:58,008
How?

255
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,425
You there.

256
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:11,133
Come here.

257
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,800
Come on.

258
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,674
Let him have a go.

259
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:19,924
No, no, no. I can't sing.

260
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,049
Look at you,

261
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,674
what a textbook loser.

262
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:23,924
Now let me show you

263
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,174
what emancipation means.

264
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:27,549
-- Pick any song you like.
-- This one.

265
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,799
-- The Tiger Hunt.
-- Behold the fearless hero!

266
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,708
Cool. Here we go.

267
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,883
This is a tough song.

268
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:43,208
-- What's that old man doing?
-- Through the forest...

269
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:46,174
Bravo.

270
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:52,050
Over the snowfield

271
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,175
Bravo.

272
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:05,883
My spirit erupts

273
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,924
to the cloud

274
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:13,424
You can do it, man.

275
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:15,008
He won't hit the note.

276
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,299
To the cloud

277
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,549
Come on.

278
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,883
To the cloud

279
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,008
You can do it, man.

280
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,300
Stop filming.

281
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,049
Erdan, are you okay?

282
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,675
Don't you scare me like that, cousin.

283
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,799
This is not good.

284
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,425
I need my medicine.

285
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:49,008
I'm going to faint.

286
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:54,424
-- Zhang Beijing.
-- Got it.

287
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:56,049
Did you print that out?

288
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,674
Is it really that hot?

289
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:59,174
Calm yourself.

290
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,258
Sir, he was here this morning.

291
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:05,799
Hyperthyroidism caused by thyroid tumor,

292
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,549
triggering hypertension.

293
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,049
We need to bring down the BP first.

294
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,299
Go get the paperwork done.

295
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,008
Be smart. Let's lower his BP.

296
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:20,758
Play with it all you want, just don't eat.

297
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,424
You're awake.

298
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:32,049
Group consultation starts in the morning.
Surgery will soon follow.

299
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,175
You just need a good sleep tonight.

300
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,049
Bro, relax.

301
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,424
It's just a thyroidectomy.

302
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,008
No big deal.

303
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,633
Are they blind?

304
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,924
Hey, come quick, this is
getting out of control.

305
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,299
They mistook me for you.

306
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,799
Come here and take my place now.

307
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,674
I kept saying that
and they wouldn't let me in.

308
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:13,674
Maybe I should come tomorrow.

309
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:15,424
Tomorrow? They'll cut me
open by then.

310
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,549
Huh?

311
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,925
Let me think of something.

312
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,924
I'm just going to
smoke a cigarette outside.

313
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:34,174
Go back to your bed.

314
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:36,150
You can't leave
without the doctor's permission.

315
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:46,425
I just wanna pee.

316
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,633
I don't now.

317
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:14,008
Come here...sir, could you come
over here and clean the hall?

318
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,508
Hurry up. Please.

319
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:27,258
Can I at least answer the phone?

320
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,633
Is this your partner in crime?

321
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:34,508
You listen to me.

322
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:36,674
Confess now

323
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:38,299
you'll beat the other guy to it.

324
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,924
I've told you.

325
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:41,675
I was there to see someone.

326
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,924
See someone…

327
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:45,549
Now, look at me

328
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,633
Can't you see who I am?

329
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,799
Sir,

330
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,925
what were you thinking?

331
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,133
Someone from you family got into trouble,

332
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,633
you should help him, yes or no?

333
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,383
Yes.

334
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,925
So, people helping each other,

335
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,883
is that wrong?

336
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,299
Of course not.

337
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,383
If so, then why are bad things
happening to him?

338
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,633
Irritation, typical symptom
of hyperthyroidism.

339
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:37,799
-- Calm down, please -
-- I am calm.

340
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,174
I just don't get it.

341
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,299
He's a good man,
why should he be the one who suffers?

342
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,674
It's just a minor surgery. And Doctor Mei…
he's so proficient.

343
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:47,558
-- It'll be gone before you know it.
-- I don't want myself to be gone.

344
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,549
I'm not even Zhang Beijing.

345
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,258
Delusion caused by hyperthyroidism.

346
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,049
Fine.

347
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,508
You're not Zhang Beijing.

348
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,633
You all know I am actually Zhang Beijing

349
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,299
but you're telling me I'm not.

350
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,299
You just don't believe me no matter what.

351
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,924
Sir, we do believe you.

352
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:13,049
-- Don't we all?
-- You're just saying that,

353
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,674
but you don't meant it.

354
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:17,049
We all believe you and we mean it.

355
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,133
Sir, have another one.

356
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,258
Hyperthyroidism makes you crave for food.

357
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:29,925
You're still not believing.

358
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:33,508
Whatever.

359
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,674
You got anything for hypertension?

360
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,675
I think I'm about to pass out.

361
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,424
Quit touching it.

362
00:23:53,425 --> 00:23:56,049
Your thyroid is fine.

363
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,258
So, what's the story here?

364
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,424
That's enough.

365
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,258
Bring him in.

366
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,299
You two,

367
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,924
what is your relationship?

368
00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:12,674
How did your health insurance card

369
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:13,675
wind up with him?

370
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,174
He's my…

371
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:19,799
cou…

372
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,174
What are you talking about?

373
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:22,799
I don't even know you.

374
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,674
I only took his card,

375
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:26,049
nothing else.

376
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,424
I was delivering food to his apartment and,

377
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,508
while he wasn't looking,

378
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,633
I just…

379
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:35,674
took his health insurance card.

380
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:39,174
I thought…the card is
for people who need treatment

381
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:40,549
and I'm people, too.

382
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,549
How should I know that he
would need it today?

383
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,924
No, you're not doing this.

384
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:45,174
Doing what?

385
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:46,924
Don't interrupt me.

386
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:49,299
I just couldn't afford
to go to the hospital.

387
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,383
So you think what you did was right?

388
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:53,799
It's not right.

389
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,674
Just emancipation of true nature.

390
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:57,008
Yep.

391
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,049
Your health insurance card.

392
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,508
Keep it well.

393
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:05,675
And I'm sorry.

394
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,299
What are you waiting for?

395
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,675
Take me down-town.

396
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:17,299
Through the forest

397
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,049
Was that what we talked about last night?

398
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,758
Euphoria caused by hyperthyroidism?

399
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,008
He was euphoric for sure.

400
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,258
You're euphoric.

401
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,299
Thank you, sir. You're a great driver.

402
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,424
I know this car too well.

403
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,483
-- I see! Bye!
-- Bye.

404
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:18,758
Erdan,

405
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:21,883
Isn't this the car you were checking out
the other day?

406
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,174
I have just called the precinct,
and you're out already?

407
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:28,799
The cop was nice.

408
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,049
He said it's merely a failed attempt,

409
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,049
so he just let me off with a warning.

410
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,174
You got lucky.

411
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,049
Now let's go to the hospital.

412
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,858
-- Take this.
-- This is...?

413
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,549
What did you…

414
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,549
I just, um…

415
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,049
paid for your surgery

416
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,133
But…

417
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,883
What about the car?

418
00:26:49,425 --> 00:26:51,424
How do you know I'm buying a car?

419
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:52,799
I'm your cousin.

420
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,883
I know exactly what you're thinking.

421
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:58,549
On second thought, this car…

422
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,049
is not that perfect.

423
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,049
When you pay me back in a couple of years,

424
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,549
I'll get

425
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,799
its newest model.

426
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,883
I'd give them some time to upgrade it.

427
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:12,383
No.

428
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,049
I can't take this.

429
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,549
I read an article online,

430
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,799
this thing can be cured
by eating dandelion.

431
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,549
And we have plenty of that back home.

432
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,674
I'll ask the missus to find
as much as possible.

433
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:23,799
And I'll eat it every day.

434
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,674
It's all I'll eat for every meal.

435
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:27,758
That ought to do it.

436
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:32,300
You do know this is nonrefundable, right?

437
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,383
And you left your motorcycle.

438
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,008
How is it nonrefundable?

439
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:02,925
The surgery was a success.

440
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:04,924
That's great news

441
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,633
for all the dandelions in the village.

442
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,549
Now I see.

443
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,008
Can I have a quick look at your card?

444
00:28:18,925 --> 00:28:21,799
You two don't even look remotely alike.

445
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,133
You got some balls pulling such a trick.

446
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,883
Damn, you're right.

447
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,049
How come you have a card, too?

448
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,508
I got it for him.

449
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,758
Cousin,

450
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:41,383
so you have insurance all along?

451
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,675
What's this? How come I didn't know?

452
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,424
Of course you didn't.

453
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:50,424
You're not even paying 18 bucks
for a new wok.

454
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:52,299
Let alone 200 for insurance.

455
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,549
You would never have agreed.

456
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,674
Even putting vinegar in noodles
is a luxury to him.

457
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:57,050
Checkmate.

458
00:28:57,675 --> 00:29:00,549
-- Does this card work the same as mine?
-- It sure does.

459
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,049
The rural health insurance
works just as well.

460
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,174
Government will take care of the sick.

461
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,924
Are you sure the spending
can be reimbursed?

462
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:07,883
Right at the Village Council.

463
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:15,383
What time do they close?

464
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,924
Zhang Beijing.

465
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:54,174
You really do hate
keeping contact with old classmates.

466
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,674
Why didn't you come to me
for the health insurance problem?

467
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:56,924
Did you forget you know someone
who works in a hospital?

468
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:59,549
My hometown is Puning, famous for
its traditional Chinese medicine.

469
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,049
My hometown is Shiyan City, Hubei.

470
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,049
One of the sources for the South-to-North
Water Diversion Project.

471
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,424
Hainan is famous for its durian.

472
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:06,049
Jiuzhaigou, giant pandas.

473
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,800
My hometown is famous for its apples.

474
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:08,008
Changchun, the city of cars.

475
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:12,049
My home is Afu Village in Guizhou.

476
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,299
There's an UFO in our village.

477
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,674
And aliens, too.

478
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:16,675
It's true.

479
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,549
Not only is the timing perfect,

480
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,882
but the location is even better.

481
00:30:55,883 --> 00:30:58,424
That the UFO would land, of all places,
in Afu Village, South Guizhou.

482
00:30:58,425 --> 00:31:00,049
And it's just 15 kilometers away from FAST

483
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,674
So, even aliens have come
all the way from outer space

484
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:02,799
to congratulate us.

485
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:02,925
Maybe they have holidays
during this time, too?

486
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:04,382
With this smart translation device,
you'll get any hot date you want.

487
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:05,424
The full moon is best appreciated
from home,

488
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:05,674
but the best lipsticks come
from alien planets.

489
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:06,424
Worry not about your pick-up lines
and haggling skills,

490
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:07,424
I promise, with this lipstick,

491
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:08,049
even aliens will fall for your appeal.

492
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,299
The aliens would go crazy for you.

493
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,175
An ominous legend popular amidst
the Chinese people says that...

494
00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:11,382
So, what are you waiting for?

495
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:12,633
Buy! It! Now!

496
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,049
(Director of The Wandering Earth - Guo Fan)
For a spacecraft of such size

497
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,882
(Director of The Wandering Earth - Guo Fan)
to traverse dozens of light years,

498
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:22,424
(Director of The Wandering Earth - Guo Fan)
Even with a warp drive,

499
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:26,425
the energy would be too great
for the craft to endure at such speed.

500
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,674
Mr. Guo, speak Chinese, please.

501
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:32,675
Could there really be UFOs?

502
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:34,508
Scientifically speaking...

503
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:36,049
-- ...there is the possibility.
-- Yes!

504
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,924
Except the possibility is close to zero.

505
00:31:37,925 --> 00:31:39,258
It's nearly impossible.

506
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,900
A UFO Falls From The Sky

507
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:49,924
My dearest fans,

508
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:51,424
here in the terrace fields

509
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:55,049
transplanting rice seedlings
is exhausting work,

510
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,132
which causes chronicle lumbar strain.

511
00:31:57,133 --> 00:32:01,257
That's why...I invented this
transplanter robot.

512
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:02,633
Put the seedling in there.

513
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,132
Alright, it's done.

514
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,424
Isn't it convenient?

515
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,925
Isn't it labor-saving?

516
00:32:08,508 --> 00:32:12,174
Thank you so much for another gift
packet, my baby love knot,

517
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:15,799
who's truly my biggest fan.

518
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
What?

519
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Do another one?

520
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,450
Welcome the "Step Into Science Again"
TV Crew to Afu Village

521
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:33,924
You guys made it.

522
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:36,007
-- Hello, Mr. Wang, sir.
-- I'm Qin.

523
00:32:36,008 --> 00:32:37,924
Don't call me sir.
Just Wang is okay.

524
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:38,925
Wang.

525
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:41,425
I think I'll stick to sir.

526
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:43,132
Here, I'd like you to meet the man.

527
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,132
From our film crew,

528
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:46,632
this is Mr. Tang, chief director,
chief cameraman and chief producer.

529
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:47,882
Mr. Chief, what an honor.

530
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,299
You're more than welcome here.

531
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,424
I'm Tang.

532
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:52,882
Chief producer, chief cameraman
and chief director.

533
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:55,257
Gentlemen, I'd like you
meet someone too.

534
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:56,424
From our village,

535
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:59,258
Mr. Wang, the boss man, the big shot
tourism developer.

536
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,174
Who drove his fancy limo
all the way here to pick you up.

537
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:03,299
He wants nothing

538
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,299
but good publicity for this village.

539
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,507
If you know what I mean.

540
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:09,382
We came to Guizhou to
investigate the UFO,

541
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:11,175
not to help you make a commercial.

542
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:13,007
It's the same thing, don't you think?

543
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:14,049
-- No, it's not.
-- Of course it is.

544
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,424
Sir? Sir? Everyone's here, let's go.

545
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:18,174
-- Yeah, let's.
-- No, no, please wait.

546
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:19,799
Just a sec. Someone else is coming.

547
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,675
-- What are you talking about? Who?
-- Me.

548
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:24,050
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce

549
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:26,299
Dong Axue, the child prodigy from CAS,
and also a native of Guizhou.

550
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,632
I've been friends with Mr. Wang for years.

551
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,299
I'm just here to see
what this alien fuss is all about.

552
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,050
That's okay, as long as you
stay out of our investigation.

553
00:33:33,675 --> 00:33:35,257
You're all our guests.

554
00:33:35,258 --> 00:33:37,549
Your presence here will
only bring grace to Afu Village.

555
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,549
-- Amazing grace!
-- Let's go!

556
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,174
-- Come on, hold it up!
-- Up, up!

557
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:42,300
Stay in line with me.

558
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:43,883
Come on.

559
00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:45,583
Welcome to the Profound
Province of Guizhou

560
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:49,049
So much has changed here.

561
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,924
Guizhou used to be known for
bad weather all year long

562
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:52,174
and inaccessible from all directions.

563
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:53,800
I certainly don't feel any of that now.

564
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:55,799
I still remember back in the day

565
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,799
my sister had a thing for this guy
from across the canyon.

566
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,549
Technically, they were just
one kilometer away.

567
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,507
But somehow they broke up
over the distance.

568
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:02,882
In Southeast Guizhou, there used to be

569
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:05,049
many villages that were
just one kilometer apart.

570
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,507
But since they had to climb
over a mountain,

571
00:34:07,508 --> 00:34:08,632
people never got to meet each other.

572
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,799
-- That's just the case.
-- Great changes have happened since then.

573
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,299
Now every county is connected to
the superhighway system.

574
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,799
And every town the highway.
Concrete roads lead to every village.

575
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,424
Afu, however, is located so remotely

576
00:34:16,425 --> 00:34:17,757
that we're missing out on
all the perks of development.

577
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:19,675
That's why we're left behind.

578
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,174
But ever since the UFO came,

579
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:24,674
it changed everything.

580
00:34:24,675 --> 00:34:26,049
Please.

581
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,133
This way, please.

582
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,174
Mr. Chief, look...hold on guys.

583
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:30,175
A tourist group!

584
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:32,174
Now we're in Afu Village, the Alienland

585
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:34,383
where the UFO first appeared.

586
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,799
You can buy alien-themed souvenirs
over there,

587
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,424
or take pictures with them here.

588
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:40,632
Then come to the village square by four

589
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:42,674
for the stage performance,
a fantasy musical.

590
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,299
Alien Love Story.

591
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,549
Business is good.

592
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,799
You betcha.

593
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,799
Some places have mountains,
others have rivers.

594
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,924
We have the UFO,

595
00:34:49,925 --> 00:34:51,382
so we serve alien dishes.

596
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,799
That's ridiculous.
You can't eat aliens.

597
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,507
Please allow me to show you

598
00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:58,174
an invention of mine.

599
00:34:58,175 --> 00:34:59,632
The FAST Sour Fish Hotpot.

600
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:01,924
With special alien service.

601
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:04,050
There's nothing else like this
in the entire universe.

602
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,632
See?

603
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:13,757
Does it look exactly the same
as the FAST telescope?

604
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:15,875
-- Where's the fish?
-- And the aliens?

605
00:35:18,175 --> 00:35:19,299
Have some soup first.

606
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,424
It'll boost your vigor.

607
00:35:20,425 --> 00:35:22,382
Make you the king of the solar system.

608
00:35:22,383 --> 00:35:24,424
Then you eat the fish,
which is good for your brain,

609
00:35:24,425 --> 00:35:26,300
making you smarter than
the rest of the galaxy.

610
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,174
Roses are red, aliens are blue,

611
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:34,383
the pot is hot, and so are you.

612
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:39,799
The FAST Sour Fish Hotpot,

613
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,300
authentic alien flavor.

614
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:43,674
Come on now. Let's dig in
gentlemen.

615
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:44,675
Wait.

616
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:47,549
Before we eat, I have a question.

617
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,883
Is there a Huang Dabao in the village?

618
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:54,799
Guys, since the mountains here in
Guizhou aren't suitable for running,

619
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,799
and there aren't so many gyms around,

620
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,757
I designed this

621
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:00,674
mandatory treadmill.

622
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:03,174
-- How is it mandatory?
-- Let me demonstrate.

623
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:04,299
Activate.

624
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,174
Set your goal in life.

625
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:07,508
A little ambiguous.

626
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,924
Maximum life.

627
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:12,008
Okay.

628
00:36:12,508 --> 00:36:14,507
Here comes my baby love knot again.

629
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:16,882
No rush with the gifts, though.

630
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,382
I do hope that you're attracted

631
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:20,299
not to my good looks

632
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,050
but my inventions.

633
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,382
What is a mandatory treadmill anyway?

634
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,008
It means,

635
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,174
unless I've reached the goal
I set for myself,

636
00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:33,050
this door will not open whatsoever.

637
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,633
Well, this is too fast.

638
00:36:40,883 --> 00:36:41,925
No.

639
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:45,675
Oh, damn it.

640
00:36:47,383 --> 00:36:48,425
Third Uncle.

641
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,925
Third Uncle.

642
00:36:52,508 --> 00:36:53,882
Second Cousin.

643
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:55,257
Second Cousin.

644
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:56,258
Second Cousin.

645
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:58,175
Huang Dabao.

646
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:01,300
Huang Dabao.

647
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:03,300
What the hell are you doing?

648
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:06,175
We have to buy tickets
to see an internet celebrity now?

649
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,424
Dabao! Huang Dabao!

650
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:09,507
Dabao, what's wrong?

651
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:11,882
Dabao! Dabao! Dabao,
are you okay?

652
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:13,050
I'm alright.

653
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:16,174
I did it for exercise.

654
00:37:16,175 --> 00:37:17,299
Just ran a marathon.

655
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,674
You don't need to run a marathon.

656
00:37:18,675 --> 00:37:20,425
Just eat some goji berries.

657
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:22,883
Who are these people?

658
00:37:24,383 --> 00:37:25,424
Allow me to introduce.

659
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:27,799
This is Qin and Mr. Chief.

660
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,675
They're here to promote our village.

661
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:31,675
Satellite TV?

662
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:34,757
Excuse me, I'll go redo
my makeup.

663
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:36,674
-- Wait.
-- Mr. Huang,

664
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:38,007
we're actually from Rediscover Science,
the documentary program,

665
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:39,883
and we're here to investigate the UFO.

666
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,549
UFO

667
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,133
They suspect that you built it.

668
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,799
I built it?

669
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,007
Qin, give this ball a close-up shot.

670
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:49,800
It could be the tool he built it with.

671
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:51,508
Take a hike.

672
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:53,508
What's with the attitude?

673
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:55,757
That's the name of it.

674
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:56,924
It's called Take-A-Hike

675
00:37:56,925 --> 00:37:58,300
I came up with that.

676
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
How come?

677
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:02,174
Guizhou is famous for its
mountainous terrain.

678
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:03,549
It's not easy walking around here.

679
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,424
So, when you need to go down the mountain

680
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:06,674
and there is no ride,

681
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:08,300
it can be really irritating.

682
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:11,049
My dearest fans,

683
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,424
this is Take-A-Hike.

684
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,674
An invention that

685
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:16,757
provides a permanent solution

686
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,132
for the downhill trip,

687
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,424
swift and convenient.

688
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:20,549
Cut it out.

689
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,382
This is not one of your
live-streaming sessions.

690
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,424
Let me ask you something.

691
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:26,300
Why didn't you go to the movie on the night
of the Mid-Autumn Festival?

692
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,008
Mr. Wang, the village head,
said the movie sucks.

693
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,550
I never said that.

694
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,175
What I said was the actors were ugly.

695
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:38,424
Where were you then?

696
00:38:38,425 --> 00:38:40,132
I was home, inventing things.

697
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,883
With no alibi.

698
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,132
Now you're leaving me with no choice
but to use the exclusion method.

699
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:47,549
Mr. Wang, would you please
summon everyone.

700
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,882
Who didn't go to the movie that night?

701
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:50,299
I need to question them one by one.

702
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,299
-- All of them?
-- All of them.

703
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,424
Mr. Chief, is your show
called Rediscover Science

704
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:57,008
or Law and Order?

705
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,257
That doesn't matter.

706
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:01,300
What matters is the truth.

707
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,049
-- Name?
-- I've eaten

708
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,007
-- Age?
-- Three bowls.

709
00:39:06,008 --> 00:39:07,799
What were you doing on movie night?

710
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,049
Noodles.

711
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,133
Next!

712
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,507
Mr. Wang, do me a favor and
summon no one of this age.

713
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:22,549
But you said you needed to question
everyone who didn't go to the movie.

714
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,882
Investigations should be elaborate.

715
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:25,174
Chief director,

716
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:26,882
shall we go check out the crime scene?

717
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,175
Where is that?

718
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:33,382
Look, I built a 3D map of the
surrounding area on my laptop.

719
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:34,632
Given the approximate distance,

720
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,549
as well as the trajectory of the thing
from the video,

721
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,799
the landing site

722
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,007
is most likely here.

723
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,882
What are we waiting for then?
Let's move!

724
00:39:40,883 --> 00:39:43,132
Wind speed on the night
was four meters per second.

725
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,174
Plus, there was mist in the mountain
and artificial light.

726
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,507
That means the landing site

727
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:47,800
should be in this location.

728
00:39:48,258 --> 00:39:50,382
We'll check out both, then.
Let's go now!

729
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:53,049
Mr. Chief, it'll be dark soon.

730
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,924
You should probably wait till tomorrow.

731
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,174
-- No!
-- Well you see...

732
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:58,424
I have a meeting to attend,

733
00:39:58,425 --> 00:40:00,050
so I think I'll just take off.

734
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:03,550
A car can't get there.

735
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,424
Then how do we get there?

736
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:06,550
Huang Dabao.

737
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:10,050
He has a tractor.

738
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:18,799
Can the tractor go any faster?!

739
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,633
Safety first.

740
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:22,925
Well, this is too safe!

741
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,924
Huang Dabao.

742
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:36,049
Mr. Chief would like to go faster.

743
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,758
Show them your invention.

744
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:41,924
For this tractor specifically,

745
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,049
I invented

746
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,799
the All-direction Multi-dimensional
Stereo Acceleration Sensor.

747
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,799
It would, instantly, make you feel like

748
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,882
you're dashing through air.

749
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:53,050
Mr. Huang, bring it on!

750
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:55,257
Is there a safety belt on this thing?

751
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:56,674
We don't wanna get tossed out.

752
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:59,225
Sit tight. Don't move.

753
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,924
Now, get ready to feel it.

754
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:03,925
Here we go.

755
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,758
It just got a bit bumpy.

756
00:41:32,383 --> 00:41:34,132
According to the coordinates,
it should be here.

757
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,507
-- The aliens are real.
-- Why would you say it's Huang Dabao?

758
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:38,924
Forget about coordinates,
what you need is a doctor.

759
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,300
Guys, come quick.

760
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,675
So, the aliens are real.

761
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,424
See?

762
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,175
I told you.

763
00:41:54,508 --> 00:41:55,549
That's not right.

764
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,632
What is?

765
00:41:56,633 --> 00:41:57,882
It's definitely not right.

766
00:41:57,883 --> 00:41:59,300
Something smells funny.

767
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,300
It's diesel.

768
00:42:01,758 --> 00:42:03,132
The UFO...

769
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:04,757
runs on diesel?

770
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:06,132
Diesel is just hydrocarbon alkyl.

771
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:07,299
Energy conversion require combustion,

772
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,924
which requires oxygen.

773
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:10,132
And there's no oxygen beyond
the earth's atmosphere.

774
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:13,382
Even my cousin's tricycle runs on gasoline.

775
00:42:13,383 --> 00:42:14,800
This is forged.

776
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,883
By you, you mean?

777
00:42:18,508 --> 00:42:20,132
-- No.
-- It is you.

778
00:42:20,133 --> 00:42:21,757
It's not me!

779
00:42:21,758 --> 00:42:22,799
It's most certainly you.

780
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,924
-- It's most certainly not me!
-- You forged this!

781
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:26,174
It's most certainly not him.

782
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,882
Judging by the traces here,

783
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:29,174
this place was recently incinerated.

784
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:30,882
Huang Dabao has been with us
this whole time.

785
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,632
He couldn't possibly have the time
to set fire to the grass.

786
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,757
Also, it is against my idea

787
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,425
of environment-friendly inventions.

788
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,174
Chief director, chief director!

789
00:42:39,175 --> 00:42:40,300
You need to see this.

790
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,882
Chief director.

791
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:44,424
Two more people didn't
go to the movie that night.

792
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:45,674
Who?

793
00:42:45,675 --> 00:42:48,808
Who do you reckon would benefit the most
from the discovery of the UFO?

794
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,425
I see.

795
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:03,375
-- Are they asleep?
-- Yes.

796
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Go, go!

797
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:13,875
Dabao! Huang Dabao!

798
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:17,175
Dabao.

799
00:43:19,383 --> 00:43:20,425
Huang Dabao!

800
00:43:20,883 --> 00:43:22,299
Where is he?

801
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,883
Dabao, where are you?

802
00:43:24,425 --> 00:43:25,674
I'm at the gate.

803
00:43:25,675 --> 00:43:26,883
Be right back.

804
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:45,674
Where were you this late?

805
00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:46,633
Where were you?

806
00:43:46,634 --> 00:43:49,133
I had to think something through.

807
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,049
Like what?

808
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,525
Sir, the Take-A-Hike.

809
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,508
It's moving.

810
00:43:58,758 --> 00:44:01,150
-- You're delusional.
-- It's really moving.

811
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:16,550
Chief director is inside!

812
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:20,674
Why would he steal my invention?

813
00:44:20,675 --> 00:44:22,007
Who's stealing your invention?

814
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:23,050
Get him out now!

815
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:33,133
Mr. Dong.

816
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:35,507
-- Chief director!
-- Go after the ball!

817
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:36,550
Get the ball!

818
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,258
Mr. Chief!

819
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,050
Mr. Chief!

820
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:45,425
Mr. Chief!

821
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:47,008
Catch the ball!

822
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:50,425
Block it!

823
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:55,800
Mr. Chief!

824
00:45:01,675 --> 00:45:03,400
-- Quick, stop it!
-- Stop the ball!

825
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,300
Stop it!

826
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,425
Mr. Chief! Mr. Chief!

827
00:45:13,425 --> 00:45:14,632
Slow down.

828
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:16,049
See? It's okay.

829
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,633
Mr. Chief!

830
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,174
Mr. Chief!

831
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,383
Are you alright?

832
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:22,382
Mr. Chief.

833
00:45:22,383 --> 00:45:24,382
I'm fine. Not bad.

834
00:45:24,383 --> 00:45:25,550
You can't even stand.

835
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,007
I'm okay.

836
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:30,049
Huang Dabao, this thing is no joke.

837
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,925
Extremely safe.

838
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:34,257
I spent most of the year developing it

839
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:35,983
and I didn't even have the balls to try it.

840
00:45:36,758 --> 00:45:38,382
Sir, you are the man!

841
00:45:38,383 --> 00:45:39,924
If I were rolling down like that,

842
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:41,675
I'd puke my guts out!

843
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,883
Oh, that reminds me!

844
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,507
-- It's okay.
-- Alright, everyone.

845
00:45:49,508 --> 00:45:50,757
Show's over.

846
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:51,925
Go back to sleep.

847
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,174
You've all seen how the big ball
rolled down.

848
00:45:54,175 --> 00:45:56,350
Now go back to sleep.
Come on, off you go.

849
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,799
Alright, I'll just cut the crap.

850
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,799
Did you forge that thing out there?

851
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,800
What thing?

852
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,882
What thing?

853
00:46:05,883 --> 00:46:08,424
Burn a fake circle in the meadow
with diesel

854
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:10,008
to make it look like an UFO.

855
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:13,882
Dong's analysis wasn't necessary correct.

856
00:46:13,883 --> 00:46:16,550
Why can't an UFO run on diesel?

857
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:19,424
Of course it can't.

858
00:46:19,425 --> 00:46:20,508
What evidence do you have?

859
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,258
Because…

860
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:26,383
I am the alien.

861
00:46:30,258 --> 00:46:31,925
And I'm your daddy.

862
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:44,507
That there is the thing you're looking for.

863
00:46:44,508 --> 00:46:47,174
You invented it too?

864
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:48,424
It is my…

865
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:50,675
biggest invention ever.

866
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,299
I did the first flight test on the night
of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

867
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,674
I didn't expect it to be a success.

868
00:47:00,675 --> 00:47:03,174
Although the cruising power
is obviously inadequate.

869
00:47:03,175 --> 00:47:05,007
But I'm still happy.

870
00:47:05,008 --> 00:47:08,758
Who knew things would get out
of control after that?

871
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:13,174
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

872
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:15,382
How was I supposed to know
it would make the news

873
00:47:15,383 --> 00:47:16,674
and bring those TV people here?

874
00:47:16,675 --> 00:47:18,007
Fair enough.

875
00:47:18,008 --> 00:47:19,883
Now I can't hide it anymore.

876
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,674
-- I'll just come clean with them.
-- And say what?

877
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:24,675
Take a hike.

878
00:47:25,883 --> 00:47:27,174
I mean you...

879
00:47:27,175 --> 00:47:29,424
...you make this public,
what about tourism?

880
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:30,550
Yeah.

881
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:38,883
Dabao,

882
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,050
don't you want everyone in the village
to have a better life?

883
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:46,674
Where's your heart?

884
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:47,925
Where's your heart?

885
00:47:48,675 --> 00:47:50,799
But, I decided to tell the truth

886
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,924
because…

887
00:47:51,925 --> 00:47:53,424
because I have a heart.

888
00:47:53,425 --> 00:47:57,174
Truth? The truth is other villages
are blessed with natural beauty

889
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:59,132
and the town of Kedu has made a fortune

890
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:00,382
off the telescope.

891
00:48:00,383 --> 00:48:01,632
What do we have?

892
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:04,549
-- Only aliens.
-- Who's there?

893
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,757
We still can't fall asleep.

894
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,299
Quick! Hurry!

895
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,799
-- Get it up there!
-- No!

896
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,549
-- I'm begging you, please.
-- No.

897
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,757
-- Huang Dabao! This is an order!
-- No.

898
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:16,424
According to article 11 of the Civil Aviation
Law of the People's Republic of China,

899
00:48:16,425 --> 00:48:19,632
Manufacturing of aircraft of any kind must
be approved by the civil aviation authority.

900
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:20,757
We can have you arrested.

901
00:48:20,758 --> 00:48:21,799
Come on, give me a hand.

902
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,049
Give me a hand.

903
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,050
One. Two.

904
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:25,300
Three.

905
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:27,550
One. Two.

906
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:28,800
Three.

907
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:30,508
One. Two.

908
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:31,800
Three.

909
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:55,424
Gentlemen,

910
00:48:55,425 --> 00:48:56,882
still awake, huh?

911
00:48:56,883 --> 00:48:58,049
Yep.

912
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,674
So, what are you doing?

913
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:01,250
Discussing, playing poker, talking.

914
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,674
We are…

915
00:49:07,675 --> 00:49:09,508
discussing and talking

916
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,549
about whether we are going to play poker.

917
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,550
That's right.

918
00:49:14,425 --> 00:49:15,550
It's true.

919
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:19,799
You guys have had a tough day.

920
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,757
And now you're playing poker?

921
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,007
I wish I had your energy.

922
00:49:23,008 --> 00:49:24,257
You're not so bad yourselves,

923
00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:25,924
still staying up at this hour.

924
00:49:25,925 --> 00:49:27,257
Huang Dabao,

925
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:28,299
why don't you tell us more

926
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,925
about the things in your yard?

927
00:49:30,508 --> 00:49:32,674
They're right there.

928
00:49:32,675 --> 00:49:33,924
Be my guest.

929
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:35,550
Just tell us more.

930
00:49:36,675 --> 00:49:37,757
May I?

931
00:49:37,758 --> 00:49:38,924
I know more about those things in the yard

932
00:49:38,925 --> 00:49:40,300
than he does.

933
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,883
It's true.

934
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,258
What's that sound?

935
00:49:53,008 --> 00:49:54,300
I was burping.

936
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,550
That was some funny noise you made.

937
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,174
Mr. Huang,

938
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:04,632
I'm feeling a little funny in the stomach.

939
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:07,757
Where's the bathroom?

940
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:09,882
The bathroom? In the yard.

941
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:10,924
Where in the yard?

942
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:11,925
Outside.

943
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:16,132
You know what?

944
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:17,424
I'll show you the way.

945
00:50:17,425 --> 00:50:18,508
Great.

946
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,300
Let's go.

947
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,050
What is it?

948
00:50:43,675 --> 00:50:44,924
You're sweating.

949
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:46,008
What's wrong?

950
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:49,633
I'm a little weak.

951
00:50:50,758 --> 00:50:52,424
-- Have some water.
-- No.

952
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:53,300
-- Come on.
-- Really, I'm good.

953
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,674
-- Just drink it.
-- No.

954
00:50:54,675 --> 00:50:56,008
-- Drink.
-- I'm not drinking it.

955
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,050
Fine, don't drink.

956
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:01,550
No need to get mad.

957
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,383
Jeez.

958
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:14,049
-- Is this another invention of yours?
-- Don't touch that.

959
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,799
It's not what you think it is.

960
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,049
What do I think is it?

961
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,175
No, don't touch that.

962
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:42,007
Relax,

963
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:44,299
you're not gonna go to jail for this.

964
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,549
All you need to do later

965
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,174
is say you're sorry to the camera.

966
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:49,800
What did you build the UFO for?

967
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,050
It was a tragic love story.

968
00:52:01,758 --> 00:52:03,425
Many years ago,

969
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:07,133
I fell in love with this girl
in the village across the canyon.

970
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:11,300
She is a fair maiden with a heart of gold

971
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,424
and the most beautiful eyes
I've ever known.

972
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,174
Plus a long thick pigtail.

973
00:52:18,175 --> 00:52:20,299
Is her name Xiaofang, as in the song?

974
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,300
It's Ａhua.

975
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,049
Her name…

976
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,299
is Dong Ahua.

977
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,757
How did you know?

978
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:29,174
My name is Axu

979
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:30,175
and hers is Ahua.

980
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,508
The hamlet across the canyon

981
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,799
is our home.

982
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,883
Xiaofu Village.

983
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,674
You two

984
00:52:38,675 --> 00:52:41,424
were separated by the distance

985
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,175
of merely one kilometer.

986
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:45,383
It is the greatest regret of her life.

987
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,632
So, you are…

988
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:48,925
her younger brother.

989
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,925
Brother.

990
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:56,674
Long time no see.

991
00:52:56,675 --> 00:52:57,550
It's been 11 years, brother.

992
00:52:57,551 --> 00:52:58,883
You've all grown up.

993
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,049
What about your sister?

994
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,674
-- She got married.
-- Good.

995
00:53:03,675 --> 00:53:04,924
That's good.

996
00:53:04,925 --> 00:53:05,925
Fantastic.

997
00:53:05,925 --> 00:53:06,925
Then divorced.

998
00:53:09,175 --> 00:53:10,675
That's too bad.

999
00:53:11,383 --> 00:53:12,383
-- She really got divorced?
-- Yeah.

1000
00:53:12,384 --> 00:53:13,799
So, what did you invent that thing for?

1001
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,050
Deliver love letters?

1002
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,424
Actually I was thinking about

1003
00:53:18,425 --> 00:53:19,508
logistics.

1004
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:23,799
You see, here in Guizho,

1005
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,424
we have gorgeous scenery
and good people, too.

1006
00:53:26,425 --> 00:53:29,132
The lack of infrastructure
is the only thing

1007
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:32,174
standing between us and the outside world,

1008
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,882
preventing lovers and products

1009
00:53:33,883 --> 00:53:35,924
from leaving the mountains.

1010
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:37,424
With improvement in logistics

1011
00:53:37,425 --> 00:53:38,882
life would be a lot easier for us.

1012
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:41,975
Well, with that crappy UFO of yours,
it'd be a long shot.

1013
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,150
No, no. Actually I think
it's pretty close.

1014
00:53:45,925 --> 00:53:48,424
There are problems in power and cruising.

1015
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,049
I'll help you figure that out.

1016
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:52,049
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

1017
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,050
That'd be great.

1018
00:53:53,675 --> 00:53:54,675
Thank you so much.

1019
00:53:55,425 --> 00:53:57,549
Brother, I should thank you.

1020
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,674
For letting me do something

1021
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:02,424
to help my home province.

1022
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:03,425
And also,

1023
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:05,550
a chance to visit my sister.

1024
00:54:07,008 --> 00:54:08,008
You sister?

1025
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:09,425
Axue.

1026
00:54:25,008 --> 00:54:26,174
Ahua?

1027
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:27,175
You're sort of an internet celebrity now.

1028
00:54:27,175 --> 00:54:28,133
What don't you call me by my screen name?

1029
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:29,133
Your screen name?

1030
00:54:32,175 --> 00:54:33,258
It's you.

1031
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:35,925
My baby love knot.

1032
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,507
You guys are too cute.

1033
00:54:40,508 --> 00:54:42,050
Well, you didn't know,

1034
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:44,424
but there was once a chance

1035
00:54:44,425 --> 00:54:46,799
that I missed because of

1036
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,632
long distance.

1037
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:51,299
If I were given a second chance,
then believe me,

1038
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,007
I'd never let her go.

1039
00:54:53,008 --> 00:54:54,633
-- Yeah!
-- Make it tight!

1040
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:31,632
A small village in South Guizhou
is the place I call home

1041
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:35,507
Amongst big mountains it lies,
secluded and remote.

1042
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:39,549
Visitors from outer space in the UFO.

1043
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:43,632
A sight that everyone can't wait to behold.

1044
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:47,549
Alien civilization, dope technology.

1045
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,549
It's all local invention,
you better believe me.

1046
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:55,549
Soaring up, diving down,
it goes wherever you want.

1047
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:59,633
Maybe someday it'll fly up
the mountains and beyond.

1048
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:06,174
The one thing I remember about my
hometown is the misty pines in winter.

1049
00:56:06,175 --> 00:56:08,049
The one thing I'd never forget
about my home is the Torch Festival.

1050
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,632
During summer it is extremely hot.

1051
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:11,174
Hulun Buir in winter is extremely cold.

1052
00:56:11,175 --> 00:56:12,674
There's snow everywhere outside the door.

1053
00:56:12,675 --> 00:56:14,174
The tasty Hot Dry Noodles.

1054
00:56:14,175 --> 00:56:15,924
I ran to play by the sea holding a tire.

1055
00:56:15,925 --> 00:56:18,050
Temple Fair on the first day
of the Chinese New Year.

1056
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,300
I can't remember.

1057
00:56:28,175 --> 00:56:31,508
ONE LAST LESSON

1058
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:46,175
St. Gallen, Switzerland

1059
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:52,675
Dad.

1060
00:56:53,425 --> 00:56:54,925
Dad, are you up?

1061
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,300
Yeah.

1062
00:56:57,925 --> 00:56:58,925
Coming.

1063
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,674
Alright, kids. Breakfast is ready.

1064
00:57:09,675 --> 00:57:11,424
Put your toys down.

1065
00:57:11,425 --> 00:57:12,549
Dad,

1066
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,174
maybe you should sit this one out.

1067
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:16,299
I don't want you to end up
like the other day.

1068
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,300
I'm fine.

1069
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,549
Why don't I call the hospital and
move your checkup forward?

1070
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,925
No need. I know my health
better than anyone.

1071
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,924
Dad should really consider retiring.

1072
00:57:25,925 --> 00:57:30,132
He wouldn't even go to the hospital,
let alone quit teaching. It'll kill him.

1073
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:32,633
University of Berkelin

1074
00:57:35,657 --> 00:57:37,957
Screenplay by Lulufu Bu, Keke Hu,
Weilin Hua & Zheng Xu

1075
00:57:43,925 --> 00:57:45,425
Hello, Professor Fan.

1076
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,925
No, no, no.

1077
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,800
Like this.

1078
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,049
Professor Fan, Professor Fan.

1079
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,925
Call an ambulance, go, go.

1080
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:29,675
He is awake.

1081
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,175
Pa.

1082
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,300
How do you feel, Pa?

1083
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:44,550
The wetch.

1084
00:58:46,175 --> 00:58:47,300
Time.

1085
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:48,925
My wetch.

1086
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,300
Your watch.

1087
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,424
My wetch.

1088
00:58:53,425 --> 00:58:55,049
Veight o'clock, the class.

1089
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,174
I'm running late.

1090
00:58:56,175 --> 00:58:57,799
Pa, you can't go to the class.

1091
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,458
-- You passed out.
-- Who passed out?

1092
00:59:00,925 --> 00:59:02,799
Class begins at veight,
and I'm not there yet.

1093
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,924
Bullshoot.

1094
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:06,049
Pa, you can't teach anymore.

1095
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,299
The doctor says you have
a cerebral infraction.

1096
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,650
-- I have what?
-- A stroke.

1097
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,925
Stone color.

1098
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,675
Or maybe scarlet.

1099
00:59:18,425 --> 00:59:20,549
-- Well...
-- Dad, no!

1100
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:23,299
I'll bring all the colors.
I'll bring all the colors.

1101
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,675
Doctor!

1102
00:59:25,175 --> 00:59:27,174
Doctor, doctor!

1103
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:29,250
Pa, where are you going?!
What are you doing?!

1104
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,674
Old Jiang, he is about to crow.

1105
00:59:31,675 --> 00:59:33,799
Who is about to crow? Only roosters crow.

1106
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,674
What rooster? Old Jiang.

1107
00:59:35,675 --> 00:59:36,924
Jiang Dazhong.

1108
00:59:36,925 --> 00:59:38,799
Before the class, clang, clang, clang!

1109
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,674
Clang, clang, clang! He needs to crow!

1110
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:42,299
-- What are you even talking about?
-- The students are waiting for me.

1111
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,174
The paints. The boat is about to sail off.

1112
00:59:44,175 --> 00:59:45,675
Pa, stop it.

1113
00:59:46,175 --> 00:59:47,175
Call me Sir.

1114
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,925
And wipe off your snot.

1115
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,049
You still don't get it.

1116
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,300
Two plus two equals veight.

1117
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,425
Your bum is going to be spanked.

1118
00:59:58,050 --> 00:59:59,424
Where is the bum?

1119
00:59:59,425 --> 01:00:00,549
The bum.

1120
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:01,550
The paints.

1121
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,175
Sorry.

1122
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,549
-- Here they are.
-- No, no, no!

1123
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,924
Calm down.

1124
01:00:06,925 --> 01:00:07,925
This.

1125
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,800
I got the paints.

1126
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,925
It began to rain.

1127
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,674
And then...

1128
01:00:14,675 --> 01:00:21,299
Cerebral infarction is a common cause
of dementia in the elderly.

1129
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:27,925
It is often accompanied by severe
behavioral and language disorders.

1130
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,549
Based on your father's symptoms,

1131
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:38,049
he has already developed alternating
periods of cognitive impairment.

1132
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:41,300
We call this 'fluctuating cognition'.

1133
01:00:42,425 --> 01:00:45,424
Your father's speech does not suggest to me

1134
01:00:45,425 --> 01:00:50,299
the classic signs of memory lapse
from cerebral infarction.

1135
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,924
But the phrases and words that he's using

1136
01:00:52,925 --> 01:00:55,924
suggest to me that his memory is stuck

1137
01:00:55,925 --> 01:00:58,674
at a specific moment in the past.

1138
01:00:58,675 --> 01:01:01,549
You mean he is living in the past?

1139
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,550
Yes, yes, you can say that.

1140
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,549
But how does the modernness of this world

1141
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:14,424
or the outside buildings not freak him out?

1142
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:17,299
Think of it this way.
Imagine he is in a room,

1143
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,549
and he is trying to put together
the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

1144
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,674
Now, the elements that

1145
01:01:23,675 --> 01:01:26,174
match his memories are the pieces.

1146
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:28,299
And the picture will tell us a story.

1147
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,925
And the story will be something
very significant that happened in his past.

1148
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,174
Tomorrow,

1149
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,299
Dazhong,

1150
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:43,049
go find some nails.
And fix the desks and chairs.

1151
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,549
Jiang Dazhong

1152
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,049
I knew I'd heard that name before.

1153
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,674
When my father was teaching
in Wangxi Village,

1154
01:01:47,675 --> 01:01:49,924
he was the school janitor, the bell ringer.

1155
01:01:49,925 --> 01:01:51,550
Clang, clang, clang, that's him.

1156
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,924
So his memory is stuck in

1157
01:01:53,925 --> 01:01:56,299
when he was teaching
in the elementary school.

1158
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,049
Are we bringing Pa to that shabby village

1159
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:59,300
go give one last lecture?

1160
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:09,133
Qiandao Lake, China

1161
01:02:25,925 --> 01:02:28,424
This Mid-Autumn festival, there might be
an overflow of tourists, [Wang Xi Village]

1162
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:30,174
putting the accommodation
of our village to a test.

1163
01:02:30,175 --> 01:02:31,424
Now is the time.

1164
01:02:31,425 --> 01:02:32,924
But all the guesthouses
in the neighbourhood

1165
01:02:32,925 --> 01:02:34,049
are booked up.

1166
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,550
Village tours are so popular now.

1167
01:02:36,175 --> 01:02:38,174
Go check the forest oxygen bar,
find a clearing, pitch a few tents

1168
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:40,174
put up a couple of tree houses,
there you go.

1169
01:02:40,175 --> 01:02:41,424
Try to get some RVs here.

1170
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,550
Boathouses on the river is also an idea.

1171
01:02:45,675 --> 01:02:46,800
International call.

1172
01:02:50,675 --> 01:02:51,758
Hello.

1173
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,425
Chief, I need to tell you something.

1174
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:01,424
Family trip this way up.

1175
01:03:01,425 --> 01:03:02,425
Okay.

1176
01:03:03,425 --> 01:03:05,549
Are you here for the tea picking festival?

1177
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,674
Please sign in first.

1178
01:03:06,675 --> 01:03:07,924
Come on, this way.

1179
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:08,925
Inside.

1180
01:03:09,425 --> 01:03:11,549
-- Where is your boss?
-- Jogging with the guests.

1181
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:12,799
It's getting late.

1182
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,549
Hasn't she gotten back already?

1183
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,924
One, one.

1184
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,299
Xiao Lai.

1185
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,133
So you just leave your business unattended.

1186
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:21,924
Guess which year?

1187
01:03:21,925 --> 01:03:23,924
2001, Shanghai Translation
Publishing House.

1188
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:24,800
-- Amazing.
-- How about this one?

1189
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,674
1998, People's Literature.

1190
01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:28,049
Hi guys.

1191
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,299
What you see here is a very special
experience offered in our village,

1192
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,674
soya beans grinding.

1193
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:33,049
You get to pick the beans
and then grind them.

1194
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:35,049
It gives you such a sense
of accomplishment.

1195
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,549
This is our 2nd generation beehive.

1196
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:37,674
Intelligent beehive.

1197
01:03:37,675 --> 01:03:38,675
Temperature change at the push of a button.

1198
01:03:38,675 --> 01:03:39,550
Temperature up,

1199
01:03:39,551 --> 01:03:40,799
dancing bees.

1200
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,800
Temperature down,

1201
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:43,049
all in peace.

1202
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,799
And the yield doubles.

1203
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,674
Everyone, why is it that moss
can break down rock?

1204
01:03:47,675 --> 01:03:49,799
I know, I know.

1205
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,925
Tell me.

1206
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,799
Hey, I heard you are about to
expand the cocoonery.

1207
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,799
I have to. The number of orders is
getting overwhelming.

1208
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,674
That's major.

1209
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:01,300
Tell everyone in the group chat
to gather for meeting.

1210
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,175
Group send it is.

1211
01:04:09,425 --> 01:04:10,425
A meeting.

1212
01:04:10,426 --> 01:04:11,925
Calling us together.

1213
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:23,424
Now can we please quiet down?

1214
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:25,049
I want to know if it is possible that

1215
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:26,799
based on this old photo,

1216
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,924
we recreate a class

1217
01:04:27,925 --> 01:04:30,049
to help Mr. Fan out.

1218
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:31,133
Listen to me.

1219
01:04:31,675 --> 01:04:34,450
I remember that in 1992, when
Fan was giving his last lecture,

1220
01:04:35,925 --> 01:04:38,174
it was raining cats and dogs,
coming down in buckets.

1221
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:39,674
Just cut the crap.

1222
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:40,758
Listen to me.

1223
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,174
I would love to help,
okay?

1224
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:44,549
But how are we supposed
to go back to '92?

1225
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:45,550
Exactly.

1226
01:04:45,551 --> 01:04:47,799
This house used to be a pigsty.

1227
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,299
Mother pigs and baby pigs were
running wild.

1228
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,175
That's correct.

1229
01:04:50,176 --> 01:04:52,049
The spot that you're sitting on is where

1230
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,424
the mottled black sow in village

1231
01:04:53,425 --> 01:04:54,800
gave birth to so many piglets.

1232
01:04:56,175 --> 01:04:57,299
I know that.

1233
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,674
Back then the village was
plagued by flies, right?

1234
01:04:59,675 --> 01:05:01,883
Now you can't find one single
mosquito, can you?

1235
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,549
Back then,

1236
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,174
all the houses were roofless.

1237
01:05:05,175 --> 01:05:07,299
And now, even the pigsties are
separated rooms with a ceiling.

1238
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,424
How can we go back to '92?

1239
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:08,925
Right.

1240
01:05:08,926 --> 01:05:10,174
Knock it all down?

1241
01:05:10,175 --> 01:05:11,674
Knocking down the village?

1242
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:12,799
I'm the first to say no.

1243
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,424
-- No way!
-- Me too!

1244
01:05:14,425 --> 01:05:16,799
I never asked you to do that.

1245
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,674
All I suggested is to restore a classroom

1246
01:05:18,675 --> 01:05:20,049
and make this last lecture happen.

1247
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,549
What about the students then?

1248
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,424
We can't go back to 7, 8 years old.

1249
01:05:23,425 --> 01:05:24,549
Yeah.

1250
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,674
1992? I wasn't even born yet!

1251
01:05:26,675 --> 01:05:28,049
Should I restore myself to nothing?

1252
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,924
We will just find some kids.

1253
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:32,174
His mind is all muddled.
He won't know the difference.

1254
01:05:32,175 --> 01:05:33,549
Exactly.

1255
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,174
Things have changed so much.

1256
01:05:35,175 --> 01:05:36,675
We can't go back.

1257
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,300
That's enough.

1258
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,550
My turn to speak.

1259
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,799
In 1982, Mr. Fan was transferred
from the city to here,

1260
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,549
he could have left in 1985
when his term ended.

1261
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,424
And why didn't he leave?

1262
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:49,674
He was a hard worker and no whiner.

1263
01:05:49,675 --> 01:05:50,799
He stayed here till all of us

1264
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,549
could go to town for school.

1265
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,049
Ten years. One teacher for ten years.

1266
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:56,299
He taught us math, Chinese,

1267
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,799
and then PE.

1268
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,049
Wearing a pair of worn leather shoes,

1269
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:00,799
he led us to kick shuttlecock.

1270
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,800
If it were not for him,

1271
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,174
you, your father and your father

1272
01:06:04,175 --> 01:06:05,674
would be illiterate.

1273
01:06:05,675 --> 01:06:07,674
It's true what Da Lei said.

1274
01:06:07,675 --> 01:06:09,049
Right! Let me ask you -

1275
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:10,799
two plus two equals what?
What was your answer then?

1276
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,925
Tell us.

1277
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,675
Eight.

1278
01:06:14,925 --> 01:06:17,299
You said eight, and I said six.

1279
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,549
Now you are the secretary,
and I'm the head of village.

1280
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,674
And Xiao Feng, who used
to play with dirt all day,

1281
01:06:21,675 --> 01:06:23,049
is now an accomplished architect.

1282
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,050
Right.

1283
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:26,674
So now it's time to show our gratitude,
our gratefulness.

1284
01:06:26,675 --> 01:06:29,924
Wait. Even if we could recreate
this classroom,

1285
01:06:29,925 --> 01:06:31,924
he is coming back from Switzerland.

1286
01:06:31,925 --> 01:06:34,299
There are bridges and cars
along the way that he can't not see.

1287
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,799
The Swiss doctor said that

1288
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,174
now Mr. Fan is making a jigsaw puzzle
in his head,

1289
01:06:38,175 --> 01:06:39,424
which is the image of 1992,

1290
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:40,924
the image of the last lecture, get it?

1291
01:06:40,925 --> 01:06:42,049
Mr. Secretary,

1292
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:43,799
If he ever runs out of the room,

1293
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,049
then it won't be 1992 anymore.

1294
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:46,174
- Right!
- Right!

1295
01:06:46,175 --> 01:06:47,424
- Right!
- Right!

1296
01:06:47,425 --> 01:06:48,425
- Right!
- Right!

1297
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:49,175
- Right!
- Right!

1298
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:51,174
-- Right!
-- You're not telling it right.

1299
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:52,175
Enough!

1300
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,924
Mr. Fan's brain is turning into a puzzle,
a puzzle about us.

1301
01:06:55,925 --> 01:06:57,674
Can't we just figure out a way

1302
01:06:57,675 --> 01:06:59,050
to help him?

1303
01:06:59,925 --> 01:07:01,549
Jiang Dalei.

1304
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,174
The cocoonery that you are expanding

1305
01:07:04,175 --> 01:07:05,424
is exactly the place

1306
01:07:05,425 --> 01:07:06,799
where the old classroom used to be.

1307
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,924
Plus, he has people
working on it now.

1308
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:09,800
That's handy.

1309
01:07:09,801 --> 01:07:10,924
Wait, what does my cocoonery
have to do with it?

1310
01:07:10,925 --> 01:07:12,799
-- Even handier.
-- What?

1311
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,799
In Switzerland, Mr. Fan keeps saying that
his father is ringing the bell.

1312
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,424
-- My father is long gone.
-- You can play him.

1313
01:07:17,425 --> 01:07:18,799
Look at you, all cocky and stuff,

1314
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,049
you look just like you father.

1315
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,775
-- Am I right?
-- Yes, he does.

1316
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,050
It's a deal then. Applaud.

1317
01:07:35,925 --> 01:07:37,000
Hey!

1318
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,275
Hey! Hey, what are you...

1319
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,549
You promised me,

1320
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:45,758
you will help me restore everything
once this is over.

1321
01:07:46,425 --> 01:07:49,799
We are pulling all the people
and resources for this.

1322
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,674
There is no turning back.

1323
01:07:52,675 --> 01:07:56,174
We fight till the end, we fight to win.

1324
01:07:56,175 --> 01:07:59,425
There is no second chance.

1325
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,800
Now kids,

1326
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:05,174
Let's turn the clock

1327
01:08:05,175 --> 01:08:08,925
back to 1992.

1328
01:08:09,925 --> 01:08:12,550
Your mission is most glorious
yet arduous.

1329
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:15,050
So dear students,

1330
01:08:15,051 --> 01:08:17,425
let's go to Bullet Point 13.

1331
01:08:18,425 --> 01:08:21,299
What was 1992 like?

1332
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,175
You weren't born yet.

1333
01:08:23,925 --> 01:08:26,049
Keep it light on the drama, though.

1334
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:27,299
You've gone through all the key points?

1335
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,549
Yes, we have.

1336
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:30,924
The most important thing is to remember

1337
01:08:30,925 --> 01:08:32,424
the name of your character.

1338
01:08:32,425 --> 01:08:34,550
Gently, gently.

1339
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,299
You two, podium to the side.
That's right.

1340
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,799
Give me that chair.

1341
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,174
Kid, hand me the chair.

1342
01:08:44,175 --> 01:08:45,425
I'll wipe it clean.

1343
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,300
Xiao Jiang, quick.

1344
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:51,924
Get this water hose in place
and running.

1345
01:08:51,925 --> 01:08:54,000
-- And patch up the roof tiles!
-- Got it!

1346
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,299
The rain should be pouring
in right through there.

1347
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,800
Roof tiles stay still, no misplacement.

1348
01:09:03,425 --> 01:09:04,799
I said we need chicken around.

1349
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,925
I didn't say they have
to be in the classroom.

1350
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,299
What are the bees for?

1351
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,799
We couldn't find flies.

1352
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,550
But the drones don't sting.

1353
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,924
Get them out of here now.

1354
01:09:16,925 --> 01:09:18,424
Not one left inside the room, quick.

1355
01:09:18,425 --> 01:09:19,924
We need to keep it realistic.

1356
01:09:19,925 --> 01:09:21,549
Mr. Secretary, the roof is done.

1357
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,508
Then go pick up them
at the village entrance.

1358
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,549
They are arriving.

1359
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,424
Come on, guys, hurry up.

1360
01:09:27,425 --> 01:09:29,549
Does the mustache look real enough?

1361
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:30,674
Real? Yes.

1362
01:09:30,675 --> 01:09:32,049
-- Stuck? Not really.
-- Don't tangle that.

1363
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,174
If it has to be really real,
I'll be driven nuts.

1364
01:09:33,175 --> 01:09:35,049
They are almost here, hurry up.

1365
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,425
Take that away, don't let him see it.

1366
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,924
What are you two up to?

1367
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,050
Raising the national flag.

1368
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:46,008
Going back in time wouldn't
do better than this.

1369
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:53,674
Greetings, passengers.

1370
01:09:53,675 --> 01:09:55,925
The train has now arrived
at its destination.

1371
01:10:01,675 --> 01:10:02,925
On the boat now.

1372
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,300
But this is not a boat.

1373
01:10:08,425 --> 01:10:09,549
We should travel by water.

1374
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:11,424
This is a waterway.

1375
01:10:11,425 --> 01:10:12,800
Look, it's all water outside.

1376
01:10:13,925 --> 01:10:15,175
Have some rest.

1377
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,300
Attention, attention.

1378
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:22,049
Target is arriving at the
dummy entrance of the back hill.

1379
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,175
Get ready.

1380
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:28,050
Pa, wake up. I think we're here.

1381
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,550
I love this smell.

1382
01:10:40,175 --> 01:10:41,424
Thank you.

1383
01:10:41,425 --> 01:10:42,425
Goodbye.

1384
01:10:42,426 --> 01:10:43,550
Wait, Fan.

1385
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:46,175
Who am I?

1386
01:10:47,675 --> 01:10:48,800
Who am I?

1387
01:10:50,175 --> 01:10:51,674
Goodbye.

1388
01:10:51,675 --> 01:10:53,049
Who are you.

1389
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:54,925
You are the man who drove me here.

1390
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,674
Class begins.

1391
01:11:09,675 --> 01:11:11,049
Don't make me ring a second time.

1392
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,175
Dazhong,

1393
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,424
I told you before.

1394
01:11:14,425 --> 01:11:16,799
Put some straws over the roof.

1395
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,549
It becomes a rain when it waterfalls.

1396
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:20,800
Okay.

1397
01:11:28,675 --> 01:11:29,800
Dazhong,

1398
01:11:30,675 --> 01:11:32,550
why has your head gotten bigger?

1399
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,049
It's the stress.

1400
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:36,675
I've been stressing over the roof thing.

1401
01:11:37,675 --> 01:11:38,800
It's pointless to stress.

1402
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,383
There is a problem to every solution.

1403
01:11:41,925 --> 01:11:43,050
Take care of yourself.

1404
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,275
Chief, chief, and Mr. Secretary.
He's here.

1405
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,924
-- I'm so sorry for the trouble.
-- We do this because we're thankful.

1406
01:11:49,925 --> 01:11:50,925
Chief.

1407
01:11:51,425 --> 01:11:52,799
Thank you for the hard work.

1408
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,799
My father is getting really sick.
He doesn't even recognize me.

1409
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,925
Let's try and see.
Everybody assume your position.

1410
01:12:15,175 --> 01:12:16,258
He's here.

1411
01:12:35,675 --> 01:12:36,675
Class.

1412
01:12:36,676 --> 01:12:39,825
-- Stand up.
-- Good morning, Sir!

1413
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:02,050
Sit down, please.

1414
01:13:04,175 --> 01:13:05,258
Mr. Monitor,

1415
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:08,925
Get up, you're the monitor.

1416
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:12,174
Why are you

1417
01:13:12,175 --> 01:13:13,425
shorter than before?

1418
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,925
Where did your dimples go?

1419
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:23,175
I smoothed them out

1420
01:13:23,925 --> 01:13:24,925
by blowing bubbles.

1421
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,675
Fragile dimples.

1422
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,425
Everyone,

1423
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:34,674
our village school

1424
01:13:34,675 --> 01:13:36,424
and town school

1425
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:37,925
are going to be merged.

1426
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,675
Why?

1427
01:13:42,425 --> 01:13:45,174
Right, by then there will

1428
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:47,924
better teachers to teach you.

1429
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:49,424
So this is

1430
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,175
my last lecture.

1431
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:56,049
There are things that I
dread I might remember,

1432
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:58,175
so I forget them in my notebook.

1433
01:13:59,425 --> 01:14:00,674
Shouldn't it be that he
is afraid he might forget

1434
01:14:00,675 --> 01:14:02,425
so he writes them down in his notes?

1435
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,300
He is babbling.

1436
01:14:04,301 --> 01:14:06,050
Jiang Xiaohong,

1437
01:14:09,175 --> 01:14:10,800
your rubber shoes are leaky.

1438
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,424
After class ask them to find me,

1439
01:14:14,425 --> 01:14:16,675
and I will mend you.

1440
01:14:19,175 --> 01:14:20,800
Jiang Qianfang

1441
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,675
Jiang Qianfang

1442
01:14:24,425 --> 01:14:27,299
Your math worries me the most.

1443
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,924
Two and two equals what?

1444
01:14:28,925 --> 01:14:30,925
-- Four.
-- Veight.

1445
01:14:32,425 --> 01:14:35,799
Black pig from south village
gives birth to 2 white piglets.

1446
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,049
White pig from north village
gives birth to 2 black piglets.

1447
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:40,425
How many piglets are there?

1448
01:14:40,925 --> 01:14:42,049
Veight.

1449
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:43,675
Correct, veight of them.

1450
01:14:44,675 --> 01:14:45,924
Veight.

1451
01:14:45,925 --> 01:14:47,924
Jiang Weian

1452
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:48,925
Yes.

1453
01:14:50,675 --> 01:14:52,299
Tell your father.

1454
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,425
I'm not going for diner tonight.

1455
01:14:54,925 --> 01:14:57,049
As long as he works hard in school,

1456
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:59,300
It will be a gift to me.

1457
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,550
It should be me working hard in school.

1458
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:06,174
Everyone,

1459
01:15:06,175 --> 01:15:07,425
Today, I will

1460
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:10,550
go off the textbook.

1461
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:13,924
I would like to know

1462
01:15:13,925 --> 01:15:17,174
what you think our hometown
will look like in the future.

1463
01:15:17,175 --> 01:15:20,174
If you want to draw, then write.
If you want to write, then draw it.

1464
01:15:20,175 --> 01:15:23,050
The title is Me and My

1465
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,049
Town

1466
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:26,299
Home village.

1467
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,174
It should be Hometown.

1468
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:29,799
Sir, it should be Hometown.

1469
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,175
Hometown.

1470
01:15:35,425 --> 01:15:36,508
Home

1471
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,300
Ten years ago,

1472
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,549
when I for the first time

1473
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:53,050
stepped into the classroom.

1474
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:54,674
There were only

1475
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,924
two students and one piglet.

1476
01:15:56,925 --> 01:15:59,299
A piglet.

1477
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,800
I wanted to turn away and leave.

1478
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,424
But I couldn't bear the sight of

1479
01:16:05,425 --> 01:16:07,049
so many children

1480
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:10,050
feeding pigs while
they should be in school.

1481
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:16,175
So I talked to one family after another.

1482
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:18,550
Finally,

1483
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:21,424
the desks and chairs

1484
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:23,550
started to fill up the classroom.

1485
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,424
The sound of you reading

1486
01:16:25,425 --> 01:16:27,175
got louder and louder.

1487
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,924
You all know the boy named
Jiang Dongfang, right?

1488
01:16:33,925 --> 01:16:35,924
Yes.

1489
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,174
When he was here he once asked me,

1490
01:16:38,175 --> 01:16:39,424
he said, Sir,

1491
01:16:39,425 --> 01:16:42,299
I don't want to eat dried radish everyday.

1492
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,800
Will studying bring me good food to eat?

1493
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:48,299
A couple of days ago,

1494
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:51,174
he came back from senior high to see me.

1495
01:16:51,175 --> 01:16:52,299
He told me that

1496
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,549
there is a good chance that he
will enter Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

1497
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:59,475
It's said that the food
in the canteen is so good.

1498
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,800
When I heard that,

1499
01:17:04,675 --> 01:17:06,800
I felt the past ten years I spent here

1500
01:17:08,675 --> 01:17:10,424
are worth it.

1501
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:12,674
What? Give it back.

1502
01:17:12,675 --> 01:17:13,925
Let go.

1503
01:17:15,175 --> 01:17:16,299
What's happening?

1504
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,300
Sir,

1505
01:17:17,301 --> 01:17:18,799
he took my drawing.

1506
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,175
It's not a drawing. It's starch.

1507
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,924
Show me the drawing.

1508
01:17:23,925 --> 01:17:25,424
It's splashed mud.

1509
01:17:25,425 --> 01:17:26,674
The monster spider's cave.

1510
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,049
No.

1511
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:29,175
No nonsense.

1512
01:17:29,675 --> 01:17:31,675
Tell me what it is.

1513
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,550
This is a school I drew.

1514
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,425
You want the school to be like this.

1515
01:17:38,425 --> 01:17:39,675
Why?

1516
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,925
This is a window.

1517
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:44,424
This is the roof.

1518
01:17:44,425 --> 01:17:45,924
What about this?

1519
01:17:45,925 --> 01:17:47,300
It's a slide.

1520
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:50,549
It's red here,

1521
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,299
and blue here.

1522
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,424
Beautiful.

1523
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:55,050
Why don't you color it?

1524
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:57,675
I don't have them.

1525
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,424
Who among you has paints?

1526
01:18:02,425 --> 01:18:05,049
No.

1527
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:07,675
Sir, I have a blue pen.

1528
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,175
I will find some paints for you.

1529
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,549
Who is it? Why does he have a cellphone?

1530
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:31,424
-- What noise is it?
-- Your student.

1531
01:18:31,425 --> 01:18:32,924
Didn't you take all their phones?

1532
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:33,925
What's going on?

1533
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:37,175
What's this?

1534
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:39,300
It's a cellphone.
You don't know what cellphone is?

1535
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:42,924
What the hell?

1536
01:18:42,925 --> 01:18:44,799
Your drawing isn't supposed to have colors.

1537
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,924
Why can't I do colorful drawings?

1538
01:18:46,925 --> 01:18:48,174
Because you don't have color pens.

1539
01:18:48,175 --> 01:18:49,175
No, no, no.

1540
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,549
-- What?
-- Red, blue,

1541
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:53,799
green, I have them.

1542
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,425
I got all the colors.

1543
01:18:57,175 --> 01:18:58,175
I

1544
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:03,174
Hey.

1545
01:19:03,175 --> 01:19:04,924
There's no water.

1546
01:19:04,925 --> 01:19:06,049
No water. Go check for any blockage.

1547
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:07,674
Blockage somewhere.

1548
01:19:07,675 --> 01:19:08,758
You're stepping on it.

1549
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:19,550
It's a mess now. Go check it.

1550
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,175
Calm down. Calm down.

1551
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:28,050
Good morning, Sir.

1552
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:36,633
The book is wrong.

1553
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:39,425
The chair is wrong.

1554
01:19:41,675 --> 01:19:42,755
You are not Jiang Xiaofeng.

1555
01:19:43,675 --> 01:19:44,675
What's your name?

1556
01:19:44,676 --> 01:19:46,674
Peter.

1557
01:19:46,675 --> 01:19:48,674
What happened to you, sir?

1558
01:19:48,675 --> 01:19:50,175
What's going on?

1559
01:19:51,175 --> 01:19:52,549
I have to go inside.

1560
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:53,675
Don't go.

1561
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:06,924
What now?

1562
01:20:06,925 --> 01:20:08,175
How did this happen?

1563
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,550
That way.

1564
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,549
Sir, why are you leaving?

1565
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:16,674
The class isn't finished.

1566
01:20:16,675 --> 01:20:18,050
Come back.

1567
01:23:18,425 --> 01:23:20,424
Mr. Fan fell down.

1568
01:23:20,425 --> 01:23:22,424
Mr. Fan fell down.

1569
01:23:22,425 --> 01:23:23,925
Mr. Fan fell down.

1570
01:24:12,175 --> 01:24:13,675
Mr. Fan!

1571
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:16,050
Mr. Fan!

1572
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:21,799
Mr. Fan!

1573
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,800
Mr. Fan!

1574
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:26,550
Mr. Fan! Mr. Fan!

1575
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:36,300
Mr. Fan!

1576
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:38,050
This is for you.

1577
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:55,275
Mr. Fan...Mr. Fan...

1578
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:02,800
Do you remember me?

1579
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,425
This is a school I drew.

1580
01:25:22,175 --> 01:25:25,050
It's red here,

1581
01:25:25,925 --> 01:25:28,300
and blue here.

1582
01:25:53,550 --> 01:26:00,175
Gently I lift up your face

1583
01:26:03,425 --> 01:26:05,050
Jiang Xiaofeng.

1584
01:26:06,425 --> 01:26:08,175
Hey.

1585
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:14,800
Your drawing,

1586
01:26:15,425 --> 01:26:17,049
now,

1587
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:18,799
I get it.

1588
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:25,925
Tell me you'll never be alone.

1589
01:26:27,175 --> 01:26:35,799
Looking deeply into your eyes.

1590
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:44,049
No need to say another word.

1591
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:52,424
Holding tightly onto your hands.

1592
01:26:52,425 --> 01:27:00,424
This warmth will never ever change.

1593
01:27:00,425 --> 01:27:04,424
Together we share joy.

1594
01:27:04,425 --> 01:27:08,799
We share the same sorrow.

1595
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,800
And we have the same aspiration.

1596
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,674
If I were to compare my hometown to a scent

1597
01:27:17,675 --> 01:27:18,924
it must be that of the ocean.

1598
01:27:18,925 --> 01:27:20,549
To me the taste of home is like cured meat.

1599
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:22,924
The taste of home is salty.

1600
01:27:22,925 --> 01:27:24,549
The smell of hotpot in the air.

1601
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:25,924
It's definitely the potatoes.

1602
01:27:25,925 --> 01:27:27,299
The taste of Songhua River.

1603
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,924
-- It's sweet.
-- Like clams.

1604
01:27:28,925 --> 01:27:32,174
-- Salty sea water.
-- Like lamb hotpot.

1605
01:27:32,175 --> 01:27:33,424
Hot oil poured on chilli.

1606
01:27:33,425 --> 01:27:34,425
Like sand.

1607
01:27:34,426 --> 01:27:36,549
Rough, dry and bitter.

1608
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:38,924
The taste of home to me
is nothing else

1609
01:27:38,925 --> 01:27:40,549
but the mouthful of sand

1610
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:42,425
on a windy day.

1611
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:47,049
THE ROAD BACK

1612
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:48,424
Many have asked me the same question.

1613
01:27:48,425 --> 01:27:49,549
With all my popularity now,

1614
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:51,049
what do I usually sell?

1615
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,799
The answer is a supreme lifestyle.

1616
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,674
The best and freshest food in the business.

1617
01:27:57,675 --> 01:27:59,424
Could you look at me for a change?

1618
01:27:59,425 --> 01:28:01,299
Stop bugging me.

1619
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:02,799
This Yan Feiyan

1620
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,800
is not that great a saleswoman.

1621
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,549
She just has a hot body.

1622
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,425
Like a trophy wife.

1623
01:28:11,175 --> 01:28:12,550
Man oh man,

1624
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:17,049
I used to be just like her.

1625
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:18,674
Jia Yuling,

1626
01:28:18,675 --> 01:28:20,549
I love the way you look now.

1627
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:23,425
Yue Longgang, quit bullshitting me already.

1628
01:28:24,425 --> 01:28:26,050
No, I meant it.

1629
01:28:28,675 --> 01:28:30,174
That's…hey, look, that's...

1630
01:28:30,175 --> 01:28:31,424
-- What?
-- That one.

1631
01:28:31,425 --> 01:28:32,425
-- Which one?
-- That's her.

1632
01:28:32,425 --> 01:28:33,425
-- Which one?
-- That woman.

1633
01:28:33,426 --> 01:28:34,674
Who?

1634
01:28:34,675 --> 01:28:35,924
Get me the best hotel they have.

1635
01:28:35,925 --> 01:28:37,049
With a freezer.

1636
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,424
-- Isn't that you know who?
-- What are you talking about?

1637
01:28:38,425 --> 01:28:39,924
Can't you finish the sentence?

1638
01:28:39,925 --> 01:28:41,049
It's that woman who…

1639
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:43,025
-- That's her.
-- Who?

1640
01:28:44,925 --> 01:28:46,924
-- What are you doing?
-- Sister, can I get a picture?

1641
01:28:46,925 --> 01:28:49,424
-- Oh my god, I'm your biggest fan!
-- The Queen of Live Commerce!

1642
01:28:49,425 --> 01:28:52,424
I watch all your streams,
don't you remember?

1643
01:28:52,425 --> 01:28:54,299
Take a selfie with us, please.

1644
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,924
Three, two…

1645
01:28:55,925 --> 01:28:57,424
What's the point of taking a selfie

1646
01:28:57,425 --> 01:28:59,675
if no one can recognize us?

1647
01:29:01,425 --> 01:29:02,549
You might wanna go easy on the beauty cam.

1648
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:03,550
It's too much.

1649
01:29:03,551 --> 01:29:05,049
Let's switch to original mode then.

1650
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:06,175
Got it.

1651
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,300
Three, two…

1652
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:11,174
Yue Longgang, original mode?

1653
01:29:11,175 --> 01:29:13,299
Do you realize how I'd come off?

1654
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,299
Or yourself?

1655
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,924
Staff ID 9438 and 9601,

1656
01:29:17,925 --> 01:29:20,424
in about 20 minutes
your supervisor will have a word with you

1657
01:29:20,425 --> 01:29:21,924
about harassing passengers.

1658
01:29:21,925 --> 01:29:23,674
Based on my personal experience

1659
01:29:23,675 --> 01:29:25,174
you'd both get a level-two penalty.

1660
01:29:25,175 --> 01:29:27,050
Let's go, Jessica.

1661
01:29:28,925 --> 01:29:30,924
There's nothing to negotiate.

1662
01:29:30,925 --> 01:29:33,050
Stop playing games with me.

1663
01:29:33,675 --> 01:29:35,924
We need to be at Shaligou
Central School at 3 P.M.

1664
01:29:35,925 --> 01:29:37,299
for the school anniversary gala.

1665
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,300
Okay.

1666
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,549
I don't want another incident
like what just happened.

1667
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:44,799
You must protect me.

1668
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,049
Ms. Yan, I love you.

1669
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:47,425
Me, too.

1670
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:51,674
There are con men out there

1671
01:29:51,675 --> 01:29:53,424
who would pose as a classmate
or a fellow countryman

1672
01:29:53,425 --> 01:29:54,674
to get close to people.

1673
01:29:54,675 --> 01:29:57,174
It's all part of the fraud.

1674
01:29:57,175 --> 01:29:58,175
If I run into one,

1675
01:29:58,175 --> 01:29:59,299
I'll give you a sign,

1676
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,299
and you need to come over immediately.

1677
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,800
Okay, okay.

1678
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:07,050
What are you talking about?

1679
01:30:07,925 --> 01:30:09,799
Twenty million is nothing.

1680
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,174
You think I care about such
a small sum of money?

1681
01:30:12,175 --> 01:30:13,424
You listen to me,

1682
01:30:13,425 --> 01:30:14,425
I have one goal.

1683
01:30:14,426 --> 01:30:16,549
That is to provide everyone in China

1684
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:18,550
with the best apple in the world.

1685
01:30:23,925 --> 01:30:25,425
Big sis?

1686
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,799
Going back to Shaligou
for the anniversary, too?

1687
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,049
Yeah.

1688
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:33,674
What are the chances?

1689
01:30:33,675 --> 01:30:34,924
It's me.

1690
01:30:34,925 --> 01:30:36,300
Qiao Shulin.

1691
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:40,424
You must have been too busy studying.

1692
01:30:40,425 --> 01:30:42,175
We were six years apart.

1693
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,800
Hi, sir, excuse me.

1694
01:30:43,801 --> 01:30:45,300
You're in my seat.

1695
01:30:46,425 --> 01:30:47,674
I just ran into a relative.

1696
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,299
I'm sorry. Can we switch seats?

1697
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:50,800
Thanks.

1698
01:30:54,425 --> 01:30:55,925
How time flies.

1699
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:57,674
One year,

1700
01:30:57,675 --> 01:30:59,799
we were performing together

1701
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,299
on a windy day with sandstorm.

1702
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:02,424
It's a musical.

1703
01:31:02,425 --> 01:31:04,299
"The Girl Who Collects Mushrooms."

1704
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:05,924
You were in it?

1705
01:31:05,925 --> 01:31:08,049
I was the girl.

1706
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,049
I was one of the mushrooms.

1707
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:11,050
Sir,

1708
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:12,174
excuse me.

1709
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,924
That seat is taken.

1710
01:31:13,925 --> 01:31:15,983
What's the matter with you?
This is ridiculous.

1711
01:31:16,425 --> 01:31:18,049
If you have a problem,
talk to a stewardess.

1712
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:20,300
Hurry up, off you go.

1713
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:23,174
Sis, you see,

1714
01:31:23,175 --> 01:31:25,299
I sell apples. And you
do live commerce.

1715
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,924
I can give you really good prices.

1716
01:31:26,925 --> 01:31:28,425
Just friend me on WeChat.

1717
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,050
Scan your face.

1718
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,799
-- Jessica.
-- No need to see a card.

1719
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,675
Just give me your number.

1720
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:38,675
Hey, sis.

1721
01:31:40,925 --> 01:31:42,425
What's up?

1722
01:31:43,675 --> 01:31:45,550
Something wrong with your eyes?

1723
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:52,550
Excuse me, Ms. Yan
needs to rest now.

1724
01:31:56,175 --> 01:31:59,083
-- Sorry.
-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1725
01:32:21,925 --> 01:32:25,275
Sir, may I see your boarding pass?

1726
01:32:29,425 --> 01:32:30,675
Here.

1727
01:32:33,425 --> 01:32:35,924
Sir, this is an economy class ticket.

1728
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:37,800
Please go back to your seat.

1729
01:32:38,675 --> 01:32:40,174
That's impossible. I...

1730
01:32:40,175 --> 01:32:43,174
My assistant booked me
a first class ticket.

1731
01:32:43,175 --> 01:32:44,675
Please go to your seat.

1732
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:48,924
The plane is about to take off.

1733
01:32:48,925 --> 01:32:51,175
Thank you for your cooperation.

1734
01:32:53,925 --> 01:32:55,799
Thank you.

1735
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,925
Say hello to the captain for me.

1736
01:32:59,425 --> 01:33:00,675
I'm sorry.

1737
01:33:01,925 --> 01:33:03,425
Call me.

1738
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,175
Say hello to the whole crew, too.

1739
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:26,050
I thought you were flying first class.

1740
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:30,924
I don't want to bother big sis.

1741
01:33:30,925 --> 01:33:32,925
So I paid to have my seat downgraded.

1742
01:33:34,925 --> 01:33:36,800
Downgraded?

1743
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:59,674
Repeat after me.

1744
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,549
Where there is a will,

1745
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:03,299
there is a way.

1746
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,549
Where there is a will,

1747
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:08,050
there is a way.

1748
01:34:08,925 --> 01:34:10,799
One more time.

1749
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,299
Where there is a will,

1750
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,549
there is a way.

1751
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:17,174
Where there is a will,

1752
01:34:17,175 --> 01:34:18,799
there is a way.

1753
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,299
Where there is a will,

1754
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,800
there is a way.

1755
01:34:37,883 --> 01:34:39,883
Keep Up Your Discipline

1756
01:34:41,425 --> 01:34:43,175
Study hard.

1757
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,924
Learn something useful.

1758
01:34:45,925 --> 01:34:47,925
Make this a better place.

1759
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,674
It's no using pushing me now.

1760
01:35:23,675 --> 01:35:25,299
I don't have the money to pay you back.

1761
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:26,674
Just give me another day.

1762
01:35:26,675 --> 01:35:29,050
I've found a new fish.

1763
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,174
Quiet, please.

1764
01:35:31,175 --> 01:35:32,550
Quiet, please.

1765
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:36,050
And I'm reeling her in today.

1766
01:35:36,925 --> 01:35:38,674
Take a grab of the yellow soil

1767
01:35:38,675 --> 01:35:40,549
and put it against my heart.

1768
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:42,950
Greetings, everyone. I am Han,
your tour guide for the trip.

1769
01:35:44,425 --> 01:35:47,299
Also a Chinese teacher at
Shaligou Middle School

1770
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:48,924
and the editor of our official
WeChat account.

1771
01:35:48,925 --> 01:35:50,049
On our way to the school,

1772
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:51,799
I'll interview each one of you,

1773
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,674
digging up some stories of our alumni.

1774
01:35:54,675 --> 01:35:56,299
And the theme of the interview is

1775
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,175
A Taste of Home.

1776
01:35:58,675 --> 01:35:59,924
I wanna go first.

1777
01:35:59,925 --> 01:36:01,049
Here.

1778
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:02,675
Qiao, Qiao.

1779
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:08,424
What's the taste of home to you?

1780
01:36:08,425 --> 01:36:10,674
Crispy and sweet.

1781
01:36:10,675 --> 01:36:13,425
As the apples from our hometown.

1782
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,800
Big sis, have a bite first.

1783
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:19,175
We'll talk later.

1784
01:36:19,675 --> 01:36:22,299
These apples make grandmas
square dancing queens…

1785
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:27,299
-- Thank you.
-- …and children slay those online lectures.

1786
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,425
Here, I've got a QR-code.

1787
01:36:29,925 --> 01:36:31,924
A Taste of Home.

1788
01:36:31,925 --> 01:36:33,299
The wetland is right ahead.

1789
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,925
We'll take a 15-minute break.

1790
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:37,549
Ms. Yan,

1791
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:40,924
didn't you say your hometown
is on the Loess Plateau?

1792
01:36:40,925 --> 01:36:42,924
Where is the loess?

1793
01:36:42,925 --> 01:36:44,549
How come it's so different now?

1794
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:48,049
The official term is returning
farmland to forests.

1795
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:51,049
Sis, you should take a
a look around Shaligou.

1796
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:53,174
We've turned some four million
mu of Maowusu Desert

1797
01:36:53,175 --> 01:36:55,799
all into oasis now.

1798
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,049
Seems like

1799
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:59,049
you've done a lot for our home.

1800
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:00,299
I'm a very successful man.

1801
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:03,549
What's the point of making billions
if you don't give back?

1802
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:06,049
Sis, I need to confirm something with you.

1803
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:07,799
You're staying at the

1804
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,674
five-star hotel in town, right?

1805
01:37:09,675 --> 01:37:10,799
Right.

1806
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,049
And you, brother Qiao, are staying

1807
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:15,675
in your old cave-house by the school.

1808
01:37:17,425 --> 01:37:20,800
In my dreams I weep my eyes red

1809
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,675
remembering the coziness of the cave-house.

1810
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:29,674
Here.

1811
01:37:29,675 --> 01:37:30,924
Han,

1812
01:37:30,925 --> 01:37:33,299
please get us a cave-house as well.

1813
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,175
Sure, I'll make the arrangement now.

1814
01:37:36,425 --> 01:37:38,550
That's not really necessary, boss.

1815
01:37:39,425 --> 01:37:41,674
You city folks would never understand

1816
01:37:41,675 --> 01:37:44,174
how we feel about our home in the country.

1817
01:37:44,175 --> 01:37:45,674
You must know, Fluffy.

1818
01:37:45,675 --> 01:37:48,175
That deep heart-wrenching nostalgia.

1819
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:50,300
What did you just call me?

1820
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,549
Fluffy.

1821
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:55,425
You had inverse eyelashes
that made you blink all the time.

1822
01:37:57,050 --> 01:38:00,425
You were the baby raised by Madam Gao.

1823
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:07,425
Sis.

1824
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:12,424
Listen to me,

1825
01:38:12,425 --> 01:38:14,174
I'd rather not talk about that.

1826
01:38:14,175 --> 01:38:16,174
Seriously. I hope that our cooperation

1827
01:38:16,175 --> 01:38:18,799
is based on our business resources,

1828
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,424
instead of this special bond from the past.

1829
01:38:21,425 --> 01:38:23,675
Why don't you tell me more
about those apples of yours?

1830
01:38:26,425 --> 01:38:27,799
I got everything on my phone.

1831
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:30,300
Thanks, sis, thank you.

1832
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:41,674
Boss,

1833
01:38:41,675 --> 01:38:43,049
that guy, Qiao,

1834
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:45,674
is definitely a con man.

1835
01:38:45,675 --> 01:38:47,174
I had a sneak peek of his phone

1836
01:38:47,175 --> 01:38:50,299
and saw lots of messages
from debt-collectors.

1837
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,300
I doubt he even has a
decent amount of cash on him.

1838
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:55,550
Is that so?

1839
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:58,174
That'd be more fun.

1840
01:38:58,175 --> 01:38:59,175
Do I look at this?

1841
01:38:59,176 --> 01:39:00,675
Right here,please.

1842
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:10,674
Go.

1843
01:39:10,675 --> 01:39:13,933
So, what did you bring with you
on this homecoming trip?

1844
01:39:17,675 --> 01:39:19,550
I'd say it's love.

1845
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:23,424
Unlike tangible gifts,I believe,

1846
01:39:23,425 --> 01:39:25,675
spiritual ones are priceless.

1847
01:39:35,925 --> 01:39:38,174
Two bowls of mutton scraps

1848
01:39:38,175 --> 01:39:39,299
Sure, no problem.

1849
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,425
Two more noodle soup here.

1850
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,675
Gouzi.

1851
01:39:45,675 --> 01:39:47,550
The bus is here.

1852
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:53,174
Watch out.

1853
01:39:53,175 --> 01:39:54,424
Lunch time, everyone.

1854
01:39:54,425 --> 01:39:56,174
Brother Qiao's treat.

1855
01:39:56,175 --> 01:39:58,424
Buckwheat noodles.

1856
01:39:58,425 --> 01:40:00,300
Sesame rice stew.

1857
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:03,550
Steamed pumpkin.

1858
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:05,299
Bread soaked in mutton soup.

1859
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,549
My mouth is watering like crazy.

1860
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:09,424
Wow, they even have lamb offal.

1861
01:40:09,425 --> 01:40:10,799
-- Fluffy.
-- Yes?

1862
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,800
These are authentic foods from home.

1863
01:40:11,801 --> 01:40:14,549
We have to try everything.

1864
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:15,924
You got it.

1865
01:40:15,925 --> 01:40:18,000
Plus, how expensive

1866
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:20,424
can a bowl of lamb offal soup be?

1867
01:40:20,425 --> 01:40:21,675
280 yuan.

1868
01:40:23,925 --> 01:40:26,050
For a bowl of lamb offal soup?

1869
01:40:26,925 --> 01:40:29,049
What did you put in there?
A special elixir?

1870
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,300
Or sea cucumber?

1871
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,175
Both.

1872
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,424
It's our new special.

1873
01:40:35,425 --> 01:40:37,425
How did you know?

1874
01:40:43,925 --> 01:40:45,674
-- Fluffy?
-- Yes?

1875
01:40:45,675 --> 01:40:48,049
-- Sis?
-- This is so good.

1876
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:50,175
Can I have another one?

1877
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,049
Just swipe them all.

1878
01:40:58,050 --> 01:40:59,299
Next stop Shaligou, let's go.

1879
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:01,049
All passengers to Shaligou.

1880
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:03,674
I'm used to carrying no cash nowadays.

1881
01:41:03,675 --> 01:41:05,549
Hey, sis. You go ahead.

1882
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:06,674
Don't wait up.

1883
01:41:06,675 --> 01:41:07,799
It's okay.

1884
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:08,925
I'll wait.

1885
01:41:10,675 --> 01:41:12,675
Thanks for lunch, Mr. Qiao.

1886
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:18,733
Still not working? Did you
update your POS terminal?

1887
01:41:19,425 --> 01:41:20,674
Brother,

1888
01:41:20,675 --> 01:41:23,174
I don't think even the latest update

1889
01:41:23,175 --> 01:41:25,300
would allow it to access a metro card.

1890
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:29,300
Qiao Shulin.

1891
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,549
I recognized your

1892
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:33,049
shameless face at first glance.

1893
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:34,549
Wei Peng?

1894
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:37,924
But Han said no one
from my class is coming.

1895
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:39,424
That's bullshit.

1896
01:41:39,425 --> 01:41:40,799
Why didn't you tell me?

1897
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,174
You big-shot billionaire.

1898
01:41:43,175 --> 01:41:44,799
What are you doing back home?

1899
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,049
Mr. Billionaire,

1900
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:48,174
could you pay up first?

1901
01:41:48,175 --> 01:41:50,174
-- Let me.
-- No, no, you don't have to.

1902
01:41:50,175 --> 01:41:51,924
-- Please.
-- Come on, I'm not letting you do this.

1903
01:41:51,925 --> 01:41:53,299
-- Don't be pretentious.
-- You're home now.

1904
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,174
-- How much do you make a month?
-- None of your business.

1905
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:56,175
I got this.

1906
01:41:57,425 --> 01:41:59,049
You don't want to fight me.

1907
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:00,800
-- Alrighty then.
-- Good.

1908
01:42:02,425 --> 01:42:04,425
What the hell did you order?

1909
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,800
Where is he?

1910
01:42:07,425 --> 01:42:08,925
Why are you lying down?

1911
01:42:09,675 --> 01:42:11,674
You and your classmates must know him well.

1912
01:42:11,675 --> 01:42:12,800
Actually,

1913
01:42:14,175 --> 01:42:15,799
we don't have that privilege.

1914
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,050
Qiao here is a billionaire.

1915
01:42:18,675 --> 01:42:19,800
He…

1916
01:42:23,425 --> 01:42:24,924
Big sis.

1917
01:42:24,925 --> 01:42:26,675
Are all the famous alumni here?

1918
01:42:27,675 --> 01:42:30,174
I know this is not the
fancy limo you're used to

1919
01:42:30,175 --> 01:42:31,050
but I can take you guys for a ride.

1920
01:42:31,051 --> 01:42:33,424
Have ourselves a desert safari.

1921
01:42:33,425 --> 01:42:34,924
Why do you keep touching me?

1922
01:42:34,925 --> 01:42:36,924
Guess there's no need for formalities then.

1923
01:42:36,925 --> 01:42:38,924
We can catch up on the road.

1924
01:42:38,925 --> 01:42:40,175
Let's go.

1925
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:44,425
Your metro card.

1926
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:51,174
About two thousand years ago,

1927
01:42:51,175 --> 01:42:53,924
this used be to a pasture for the Huns.

1928
01:42:53,925 --> 01:42:56,275
It was larger than Hainan Island.

1929
01:42:56,675 --> 01:42:57,799
And by Tang Dynasty,

1930
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,299
it became a desert.

1931
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:01,174
-- Say, Fluffy…
-- Yes, sis?

1932
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,674
Didn't you say you made a huge contribution

1933
01:43:03,675 --> 01:43:05,549
to afforestation of the Maosuwu?

1934
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:07,299
Nothing worth mentioning.

1935
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:09,424
I can prove that. About ten
years ago,

1936
01:43:09,425 --> 01:43:11,549
Qiao made a donation of
200,000 to the school.

1937
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:12,674
No dig deal.

1938
01:43:12,675 --> 01:43:15,799
He said he could grow apple trees in sand.

1939
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,799
Now the dunes are covered by orchards,

1940
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,049
with the most exuberant

1941
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:21,049
fruits and trees.

1942
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:23,174
That must be a wonderful sight to see.

1943
01:43:23,175 --> 01:43:25,300
What don't we go have a look?

1944
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:28,174
We can't, because…

1945
01:43:28,175 --> 01:43:29,424
the show's about to start.

1946
01:43:29,425 --> 01:43:31,174
It'd be quite a detour.

1947
01:43:31,175 --> 01:43:32,424
Nonsense.

1948
01:43:32,425 --> 01:43:34,175
It's just outside the sand area.

1949
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,299
It used to stretch

1950
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:46,424
from over there

1951
01:43:46,425 --> 01:43:48,049
to right here,

1952
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:50,550
with fruit trees yea tall.

1953
01:43:51,425 --> 01:43:54,275
It just so happened that last year
they had them all dug up.

1954
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:00,799
Mainly because the fruit

1955
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,150
turned out to be of poor quality.

1956
01:44:03,175 --> 01:44:04,175
Sis,

1957
01:44:04,176 --> 01:44:05,674
if you have the time,

1958
01:44:05,675 --> 01:44:06,924
I'll take you to the new plantation,

1959
01:44:06,925 --> 01:44:09,425
which is absolutely magnificent.

1960
01:44:15,675 --> 01:44:17,800
Why are you staring at me like that?

1961
01:44:19,175 --> 01:44:21,550
I'm telling you the truth.

1962
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:43,299
Over that ridge ahead
is our school.

1963
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:44,425
Stop the car.

1964
01:44:45,675 --> 01:44:46,925
What's wrong, sis?

1965
01:44:48,425 --> 01:44:51,050
Is that the path leading to the hilltop?

1966
01:44:52,425 --> 01:44:53,425
Sister,

1967
01:44:53,426 --> 01:44:54,924
say, you make a hole with each step.

1968
01:44:54,925 --> 01:44:56,424
It's like planting seedlings
with high heels.

1969
01:44:56,425 --> 01:44:58,050
Slow down, sis.

1970
01:44:58,925 --> 01:45:01,800
Boss, try to stay under the umbrella.

1971
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:03,674
All that skin whitening is going to waste.

1972
01:45:03,675 --> 01:45:05,549
Slow down, please.

1973
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:07,799
You walk surprisingly fast, sis.

1974
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:08,924
Are we there yet?

1975
01:45:08,925 --> 01:45:10,299
We are.

1976
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:14,175
Madam Gao is buried under the tree.

1977
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:18,549
See? The new school.

1978
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:20,658
Look how great it is.

1979
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:23,299
Too bad

1980
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:25,425
the old lady didn't get to see it.

1981
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:28,425
I've come home to see you.

1982
01:45:33,425 --> 01:45:35,675
You told each one of us…

1983
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:38,799
Learn something useful.

1984
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,800
Make this a better place.

1985
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,299
Now that I'm back.

1986
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:51,675
I did learn something useful.

1987
01:45:52,425 --> 01:45:54,550
But you're not around anymore.

1988
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:59,675
Am I a good student or what?

1989
01:46:01,175 --> 01:46:02,924
These past few years

1990
01:46:02,925 --> 01:46:04,925
I kept dreaming of you.

1991
01:46:06,425 --> 01:46:09,425
I dreamt that you lost me.

1992
01:46:19,175 --> 01:46:20,175
Coming through, watch out.

1993
01:46:20,176 --> 01:46:21,549
Why are you holding a big vase?

1994
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:22,799
It's my gift for the school.

1995
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:23,924
I had it custom-made.

1996
01:46:23,925 --> 01:46:27,424
In honor of the 40th anniversary
of Shaligou Central School,

1997
01:46:27,425 --> 01:46:28,549
let the show

1998
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:30,550
begin now.

1999
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,050
Go.

2000
01:46:39,175 --> 01:46:41,049
The man I want to become

2001
01:46:41,050 --> 01:46:43,924
is someone I've never met.

2002
01:46:43,925 --> 01:46:45,299
He talks big.

2003
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:46,674
Always bragging.

2004
01:46:46,675 --> 01:46:49,299
Many think of him as a liar.

2005
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:51,674
But he was an orphan.

2006
01:46:51,675 --> 01:46:54,549
He was just 18 months old
when he got acute typhus fever

2007
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:57,674
and was abandoned on a mountain trail.

2008
01:46:57,675 --> 01:47:01,299
Madam Gao, our old principal, took him in.

2009
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:04,924
Later, he made a fortune selling fruit.

2010
01:47:04,925 --> 01:47:06,049
He donated lots of money

2011
01:47:06,050 --> 01:47:07,924
to build us a new school.

2012
01:47:07,925 --> 01:47:09,174
Mr. Han said

2013
01:47:09,175 --> 01:47:11,299
back then the sand storms were so bad

2014
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,800
that everyone was driven away.

2015
01:47:16,425 --> 01:47:19,299
And that on Madam Gao's dying bed

2016
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:22,925
she said the one thing
she couldn't let go was the kids.

2017
01:47:29,175 --> 01:47:31,799
So, Mr. Qiao told our parents

2018
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,299
to quit their jobs in the city
and come back.

2019
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:35,799
He also said that he had
this new technology

2020
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,675
that would make everybody rich.

2021
01:47:42,925 --> 01:47:44,924
To maintain the moisture

2022
01:47:44,925 --> 01:47:46,174
you must wrap it up to here.

2023
01:47:46,175 --> 01:47:48,425
Got it? Yeah.

2024
01:47:49,425 --> 01:47:51,174
He lived a simple life

2025
01:47:51,175 --> 01:47:53,174
for he put all his money in the project.

2026
01:47:53,175 --> 01:47:56,049
And he said if they could improve
the quality of the apple,

2027
01:47:56,050 --> 01:47:58,425
they'd make a lot of money in the future.

2028
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:06,675
But little did he know…

2029
01:48:08,175 --> 01:48:10,174
Why are you crying when
you get paid no matter what?

2030
01:48:10,175 --> 01:48:11,674
Worst comes worst,
we'll just reclaim the land

2031
01:48:11,675 --> 01:48:13,924
and develop a new breed.

2032
01:48:13,925 --> 01:48:17,175
Don't worry about the cost,
I'm a billionaire.

2033
01:48:26,050 --> 01:48:28,174
More and more people
came to help with afforestation,

2034
01:48:28,175 --> 01:48:30,299
as well as education and
building the new school.

2035
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:32,299
Our school got bigger and bigger

2036
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:35,299
while the sand storms
got smaller and smaller.

2037
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:38,550
This year, the sandy apple
is finally a success.

2038
01:48:39,425 --> 01:48:43,174
My dad said as long as
they can sell apples,

2039
01:48:43,175 --> 01:48:46,800
he'll be able to pay off all the debts.

2040
01:48:48,175 --> 01:48:49,549
Mr. Han said

2041
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:52,300
everyone can be changed by someone else

2042
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:56,549
but only a few can truly
have an impact on others.

2043
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:58,424
That is the man I want to become.

2044
01:48:58,425 --> 01:48:59,425
Qiao Shulin

2045
01:48:59,426 --> 01:49:01,550
of Shaligou.

2046
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,299
Qiao Shulin is my buddy.

2047
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:09,800
We've been best friends forever.

2048
01:49:10,925 --> 01:49:12,424
Shulin.

2049
01:49:12,425 --> 01:49:13,549
We're here, Shulin.

2050
01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:15,300
Fluffy.

2051
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:27,800
Fluffy.

2052
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:31,050
Fluffy.

2053
01:49:37,925 --> 01:49:40,424
The kids wanted it to be a surprise.

2054
01:49:40,425 --> 01:49:42,049
It kills me having to

2055
01:49:42,050 --> 01:49:44,050
hide it from you all the way here.

2056
01:49:45,175 --> 01:49:46,549
Brother Qiao,

2057
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:48,674
on behalf of myself,

2058
01:49:48,675 --> 01:49:50,174
my students,

2059
01:49:50,175 --> 01:49:52,300
and everyone in the village,

2060
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:58,300
thank you.

2061
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,174
For god's sake,

2062
01:50:07,175 --> 01:50:08,924
stop crying.

2063
01:50:08,925 --> 01:50:10,300
Thank you.

2064
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:14,675
Shulin, here. Let's
take a selfie together.

2065
01:50:15,425 --> 01:50:16,550
Sure.

2066
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,674
Jessica,

2067
01:50:20,675 --> 01:50:23,425
we're staying tomorrow,
got some live-streaming promotion to do.

2068
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:25,674
With one new product.

2069
01:50:25,675 --> 01:50:27,049
I know.

2070
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:28,550
The sandy apple.

2071
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:42,299
The sun hanging above sand dunes

2072
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,549
Shines ever brightly

2073
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:46,924
Upon sand slopes underneath the sky

2074
01:50:46,925 --> 01:50:49,299
Holes are being dug

2075
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:51,174
Hey-yo hey-ah hey-yo

2076
01:50:51,175 --> 01:50:53,799
Holes are being dug

2077
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:56,049
One sapling after another

2078
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:58,299
Are planted in the holes

2079
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:02,799
As they look up to gaze upon the sky

2080
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:07,800
And they look up to gaze upon the sky

2081
01:51:43,675 --> 01:51:45,174
I now live in Hainan,

2082
01:51:45,175 --> 01:51:48,299
some 1240 kilometers from Guiyang,
my hometown.

2083
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:50,924
I'm about 300 kilometers away from home.

2084
01:51:50,925 --> 01:51:52,049
Over 10,000 kilometers.

2085
01:51:52,050 --> 01:51:53,799
In a way I've never really left.

2086
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,299
2446 kilometers.

2087
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:57,925
I can only go back during
the Chinese New Year holidays.

2088
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:05,174
I'm an artist, studying at Repin Academy
of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, Russia.

2089
01:52:05,175 --> 01:52:06,424
The distance from my hometown,

2090
01:52:06,425 --> 01:52:08,549
Xihulu Village, Ximilu Town,

2091
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:10,799
Xiqin County, Xihong City,

2092
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,050
is 6,240 kilometers.

2093
01:52:19,550 --> 01:52:22,133
Sweetheart, would you just calm down?

2094
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:25,424
Be the master of your emotions.

2095
01:52:25,425 --> 01:52:27,550
Not the other way around.

2096
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:32,424
Can you be more rational?
You're such a scene maker.

2097
01:52:32,425 --> 01:52:33,925
Go ahead. I don't care.

2098
01:52:37,425 --> 01:52:38,674
You need to trust me.

2099
01:52:38,675 --> 01:52:40,299
I can fix it myself.

2100
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:42,175
This would look really bad for me.

2101
01:52:43,675 --> 01:52:45,299
Please, I'm begging you.

2102
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,424
Please. Please.

2103
01:52:47,425 --> 01:52:49,549
-- Hi, Mr. Ma.
-- Hi, Mr. Lee.

2104
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:51,475
-- Getting hot water?
-- Yeah, for a foot bath.

2105
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,299
What a shame.

2106
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,550
People respect me here.

2107
01:53:01,925 --> 01:53:04,174
Impulse is a demon.

2108
01:53:04,175 --> 01:53:05,425
Don't ruin it.

2109
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:08,924
If you're getting in there,

2110
01:53:08,925 --> 01:53:10,300
at least knock first.

2111
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:13,049
You've been rattling on and on.

2112
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:15,049
Do I really look that immature to you?

2113
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:16,050
Of course not.

2114
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:21,800
Ms. Qiu?

2115
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:24,174
Allow me to introduce.

2116
01:53:24,175 --> 01:53:26,299
This is Ma Liang's wife,

2117
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,424
Chief Couch of our city wrestling team.

2118
01:53:28,425 --> 01:53:29,800
Comrade Qiu Xia.

2119
01:53:30,675 --> 01:53:32,674
Mr. Curator, there is something
I want to ask you.

2120
01:53:32,675 --> 01:53:35,549
My husband Ma Liang is being
dispatched to help the poor in rural areas.

2121
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:37,049
Did you arrange that?

2122
01:53:37,050 --> 01:53:38,299
You don't have to thank me for that.

2123
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:39,674
Send someone else.

2124
01:53:39,675 --> 01:53:41,675
He can do nothing but paint.

2125
01:53:42,675 --> 01:53:43,925
Comrade Qiu Xia.

2126
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:47,975
This can't be Ma Liang's real thought.

2127
01:53:48,425 --> 01:53:51,299
When we first got involved in this
poverty alleviation program,

2128
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:53,174
I asked Ma Liang about his opinions.

2129
01:53:53,175 --> 01:53:54,924
And his exact words were

2130
01:53:54,925 --> 01:53:56,300
"I'd love to."

2131
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:59,483
I think what he meant to say was
"I don't want to".

2132
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:01,674
This is a serious task that

2133
01:54:01,675 --> 01:54:03,424
shouldn't be joked about.

2134
01:54:03,425 --> 01:54:05,174
We should have our eyes on the big picture.

2135
01:54:05,175 --> 01:54:06,924
-- Right?
-- Right!

2136
01:54:06,925 --> 01:54:10,683
Ma Liang is preparing to into
Repin Academy of Fine Arts in Russia.

2137
01:54:11,175 --> 01:54:12,674
A phoenix

2138
01:54:12,675 --> 01:54:14,674
can not lay in a chicken
coop his whole life,

2139
01:54:14,675 --> 01:54:15,675
can he?

2140
01:54:19,675 --> 01:54:20,924
A man

2141
01:54:20,925 --> 01:54:23,924
should have his own mind over his wife.

2142
01:54:23,925 --> 01:54:25,674
She is your wife,

2143
01:54:25,675 --> 01:54:27,049
not your mother.

2144
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:28,299
In your family,

2145
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:29,800
who rules?

2146
01:54:44,175 --> 01:54:45,175
Go home.

2147
01:54:47,425 --> 01:54:48,425
In my family,

2148
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:50,800
strength rules.

Letter of Admission from Repin Academy
of Fine Arts of Russia to Ma Liang

2152
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:11,799
(One year later)

2153
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:13,549
I got the sausages you sent to me.

2154
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:14,799
The whole family thinks that

2155
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,424
they taste better than Chinese sausages.

2156
01:55:16,425 --> 01:55:17,674
That's for sure.

2157
01:55:17,675 --> 01:55:19,800
The Russian recipe is so different.

2158
01:55:23,425 --> 01:55:25,175
Honey, what is that you are painting?

2159
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:28,675
It doesn't look like the
Russian painting I imagined.

2160
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,799
It has the style of

2161
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,924
production brigades back in the old days.

2162
01:55:32,925 --> 01:55:35,425
I'm experimenting with different styles.

2163
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:37,799
You've been watching me for a while.

2164
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:40,049
-- Why don't you go downstairs for a walk?
-- No.

2165
01:55:40,050 --> 01:55:41,299
Be good.

2166
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:43,174
A pregnant woman should stay active,

2167
01:55:43,175 --> 01:55:44,799
it helps the fetus develop.

2168
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,049
You develop first.

2169
01:55:46,050 --> 01:55:47,174
I want to watch you having breakfast.

2170
01:55:47,175 --> 01:55:49,050
I'm already over-developed.

2171
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:51,550
You're waking up my roommate.

2172
01:55:51,551 --> 01:55:52,799
Go. Go take a walk.

2173
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,174
Wait.

2174
01:55:54,175 --> 01:55:55,549
This Mendeleev guy,

2175
01:55:55,550 --> 01:55:56,924
does he have a girlfriend?

2176
01:55:56,925 --> 01:55:58,175
Why do you ask?

2177
01:55:58,925 --> 01:56:01,100
I find him weird.

2178
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:03,299
The way he looks at me

2179
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:04,675
is so sneaky.

2180
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:09,058
Oh my. Can he understand
what I'm saying?

2181
01:56:10,925 --> 01:56:11,925
You're crazy.

2182
01:56:11,926 --> 01:56:13,174
I'm warning you, Ma Liang.

2183
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:15,549
I heard that foreigners can
be rather loose,

2184
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:17,049
especially you artists.

2185
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:18,549
Keep your distance from him, you hear me?

2186
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:20,424
What is this nonsense?

2187
01:56:20,425 --> 01:56:22,424
I said I don't wanna come,
and you made me to.

2188
01:56:22,425 --> 01:56:23,924
Now that I'm here,
you're being super paranoid.

2189
01:56:23,925 --> 01:56:25,174
-- Then what?
-- I go home.

2190
01:56:25,175 --> 01:56:26,424
I just listen to you and go home.

2191
01:56:26,425 --> 01:56:27,674
Alright.

2192
01:56:27,675 --> 01:56:29,050
I'm gonna take a walk.

2193
01:56:37,050 --> 01:56:38,424
Is your wife

2194
01:56:38,425 --> 01:56:40,175
getting suspicious of us?

2195
01:56:40,675 --> 01:56:42,174
It can't be.

2196
01:56:42,175 --> 01:56:44,674
Pregnant women are just super sensitive.

2197
01:56:44,675 --> 01:56:46,425
What if she finds out?

2198
01:56:47,175 --> 01:56:48,674
If found out,

2199
01:56:48,675 --> 01:56:50,675
we might be on Topics in Focus.

2200
01:56:51,925 --> 01:56:53,175
Be quiet.

2201
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:56,925
Sweetheart, what again?

2202
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:58,924
Yeah.

2203
01:56:58,925 --> 01:57:00,925
Do you receive the sweater I sent to you?

2204
01:57:02,050 --> 01:57:03,050
Sweater.

2205
01:57:04,675 --> 01:57:06,424
The sweater

2206
01:57:06,425 --> 01:57:08,799
is in the reception office.

2207
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,175
I haven't gotten it yet.

2208
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,424
Then go and get it.

2209
01:57:12,425 --> 01:57:14,049
I want to see if it fits.

2210
01:57:14,050 --> 01:57:15,799
Why the rush? I'll show you tomorrow.

2211
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:19,050
You're not going to get it.
If so, then I'll sit here all day.

2212
01:57:20,050 --> 01:57:21,983
Okay. I'm hanging up.

2213
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,050
Shit!

2214
01:57:25,925 --> 01:57:27,049
Hello Brother,

2215
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:28,674
You received the sweater
from my wife. Right?

2216
01:57:28,675 --> 01:57:30,174
Take a picture and send it to me.

2217
01:57:30,175 --> 01:57:31,299
ASAP.

2218
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:32,383
Quick!

2219
01:57:46,175 --> 01:57:47,924
What takes you so long?

2220
01:57:47,925 --> 01:57:49,049
Oh my, honey.

2221
01:57:49,050 --> 01:57:50,424
You're such a deft knitter.

2222
01:57:50,425 --> 01:57:51,674
It's beautiful.

2223
01:57:51,675 --> 01:57:53,299
Even Mendeleev likes it.

2224
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:54,800
（Russian） Very good.

2225
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:57,300
（Russian） Thank you, my good friend.

2226
01:57:57,925 --> 01:57:59,299
I'm the hot one now.

2227
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:00,550
Stay still. Let me look at it.

2228
01:58:01,425 --> 01:58:04,174
Did I knit it too small
or you've gained weight?

2229
01:58:04,175 --> 01:58:05,299
It looks so tight.

2230
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:07,424
I indeed put on some weight.
But tight is good.

2231
01:58:07,425 --> 01:58:08,549
I can wear a jacket over it.

2232
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:12,549
-- That'll be cool.
-- Well, the cuffs look so weird.

2233
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:13,924
It's a sweater, don't worry.

2234
01:58:13,925 --> 01:58:16,150
It will become loose over time.

2235
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,424
Nah. Turn around.

2236
01:58:18,425 --> 01:58:20,799
-- I want to see the back.
-- There is nothing different.

2237
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,549
It's basically the same, back and front.

2238
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:23,799
Just turn around.

2239
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,424
It's the same. See?

2240
01:58:25,425 --> 01:58:26,425
Stop messing around.

2241
01:58:26,426 --> 01:58:27,924
-- It's the same.
-- Ma Liang!

2242
01:58:27,925 --> 01:58:29,174
It does fit. You see it?

2243
01:58:29,175 --> 01:58:30,300
Ma Liang.

2244
01:58:41,550 --> 01:58:43,300
Shitty network, get stuck again.

2245
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:46,675
What a crappy connection in Russia.

2246
01:58:48,050 --> 01:58:49,924
That's it. I'm taking a walk now.

2247
01:58:49,925 --> 01:58:51,050
Try to lose some weight.

2248
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:57,633
She hang up.

2249
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:01,558
-- I burned my chest.
-- Are you alright?

2250
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:03,674
Chief, you've sacrificed so much.

2251
01:59:03,675 --> 01:59:05,049
You owe me no apology,
we're in the same boat.

2252
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:07,299
-- Go get changed.
-- Okay.

2253
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:09,924
-- Oh my.
-- Such a pickle I dragged you into.

2254
01:59:09,925 --> 01:59:11,675
It's not a big deal.

2255
01:59:13,425 --> 01:59:15,049
You're not removing the makeup.

2256
01:59:15,050 --> 01:59:16,174
Nah.

2257
01:59:16,175 --> 01:59:18,174
In case of your wife calls by surprise.

2258
01:59:18,175 --> 01:59:19,800
Double-fold eyelids are tricky to make.

2259
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,675
My trouble of a wife.

2260
01:59:29,550 --> 01:59:30,550
Sit tight.

2261
01:59:43,175 --> 01:59:45,299
-- What happened to your motorbike?
-- The clutch cable fell loose.

2262
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:47,299
-- Use mine if you're in a hurry.
-- It's okay, Mr. Secretary.

2263
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:50,049
Please go about your work.
Get to the side when cars drive by.

2264
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:51,049
Don't play on the road.

2265
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:54,174
Mr. Secretary, going to work?

2266
01:59:54,175 --> 01:59:55,924
Yeah, Uncle Qi.

2267
01:59:55,925 --> 01:59:58,799
The paddy field tableau is our tourist
attraction to the tourists.

2268
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:01,799
You have to put lots of work
and heart into your lot.

2269
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,049
-- Follow the exact design when planting.
-- Got it.

2270
02:00:04,050 --> 02:00:06,174
You're not only a farmer now,
but also an artist.

2271
02:00:06,175 --> 02:00:07,925
Well I don't have your talent.

2272
02:00:08,925 --> 02:00:11,174
-- Mr. Secretary.
-- Yes, Auntie Li?

2273
02:00:11,175 --> 02:00:12,674
I heard you and your wife are in crisis.

2274
02:00:12,675 --> 02:00:13,924
When are you going to get divorced?

2275
02:00:13,925 --> 02:00:15,900
A niece of mine is
recently divorced.

2276
02:00:16,925 --> 02:00:18,924
What are you babbling about?

2277
02:00:18,925 --> 02:00:20,549
Have some compassion for others, would you?

2278
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:22,175
His wife is pregnant.

2279
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:25,924
Brother, I need two
cases of soda.

2280
02:00:25,925 --> 02:00:26,925
Help yourself.

2281
02:00:29,925 --> 02:00:32,549
You two are finally back home.

2282
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:34,674
You are the unique pride of our village.

2283
02:00:34,675 --> 02:00:36,049
Remember to help your family
with the chores.

2284
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:39,424
Mr. Secretary, we're accustomed to
the depravity of afternoon tea in the city,

2285
02:00:39,425 --> 02:00:40,799
We might need a few
more days to acclimate.

2286
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,925
They give away tea to bricklayers?

2287
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:45,674
You spend your days slacking,

2288
02:00:45,675 --> 02:00:47,425
and what's that haircut?

2289
02:00:48,050 --> 02:00:49,924
So trashy and indecent.

2290
02:00:49,925 --> 02:00:51,925
Pot calling the kettle black.

2291
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:55,800
I scan to pay the soda, brother.

2292
02:00:57,175 --> 02:00:58,674
Cut it out.

2293
02:00:58,675 --> 02:00:59,675
Go about your business. Go.

2294
02:00:59,676 --> 02:01:01,049
Can't we just do business the proper way?

2295
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:03,424
It's a disgrace if I take your money.

2296
02:01:03,425 --> 02:01:05,424
Just go. Get out. Out!

2297
02:01:05,425 --> 02:01:07,299
-- Do you want me to come back or not?
-- I don't care.

2298
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:08,425
Stop scanning.

2299
02:01:11,675 --> 02:01:13,299
Oh god! Mr. Secretary!

2300
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:14,549
Are you alright, Mr. Secretary?

2301
02:01:14,550 --> 02:01:16,800
Brother, is this really necessary?

2302
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:18,550
You...

2303
02:01:18,551 --> 02:01:19,925
Is this really necessary?

2304
02:01:24,175 --> 02:01:25,674
You overpaid. Come back!

2305
02:01:25,675 --> 02:01:27,049
It's settled.

2306
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:29,049
（Russian） Nice to meet you.

2307
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:30,924
Mamma Mia, that's a lot of trills.
Say it again.

2308
02:01:30,925 --> 02:01:32,674
（Russian） So nice to meet you.

2309
02:01:32,675 --> 02:01:34,550
（Russian） So nice to meet you.

2310
02:01:36,675 --> 02:01:39,674
Folks, take a break from your work.

2311
02:01:39,675 --> 02:01:42,549
Have some soda, Mr. Secretary's treat.

2312
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:43,550
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

2313
02:01:43,551 --> 02:01:47,425
Hi, Mr. Secretary.

2314
02:01:50,425 --> 02:01:51,549
What is this all about?

2315
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:52,550
This hour

2316
02:01:52,551 --> 02:01:55,424
your wife will most likely call you.

2317
02:01:55,425 --> 02:01:57,924
So we all volunteer to help
you fool your wife.

2318
02:01:57,925 --> 02:01:59,300
Yes.

2319
02:02:00,425 --> 02:02:02,675
It seems everyone knows
about my family matter.

2320
02:02:04,425 --> 02:02:07,424
In the countryside, even
the walls have ears.

2321
02:02:07,425 --> 02:02:09,425
So I went ahead and told them in advance.

2322
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:29,549
I've heard so many times
the touching story of Ms. Qiu

2323
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:31,800
rescuing your husband by
wrestling with the curator.

2324
02:02:32,425 --> 02:02:35,049
Now I finally get to admire
the work of Mr. Ma

2325
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:36,924
and the talent overflowed from it.

2326
02:02:36,925 --> 02:02:38,675
An unspeakable sensation seizes me.

2327
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:44,924
I find this piece particularly brilliant.

2328
02:02:44,925 --> 02:02:46,799
With minimal composition,

2329
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,550
it conveys such a profound meaning.

2330
02:02:50,675 --> 02:02:52,049
It's a plastic film.

2331
02:02:52,050 --> 02:02:54,175
I just bought this new frame online.

2332
02:03:03,925 --> 02:03:05,049
（Russian） Good afternoon.

2333
02:03:05,050 --> 02:03:06,424
Where are you?

2334
02:03:06,425 --> 02:03:07,550
I'm painting outdoors.

2335
02:03:09,425 --> 02:03:11,799
Meng Meng and her boyfriend are here.

2336
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:12,924
Her boyfriend, Chang Mao.

2337
02:03:12,925 --> 02:03:13,925
Remember him?

2338
02:03:13,925 --> 02:03:15,174
Hi, Mr. Ma.

2339
02:03:15,175 --> 02:03:16,299
Of course I remember him.

2340
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:17,424
The photographer

2341
02:03:17,425 --> 02:03:18,674
who specializes in animals.

2342
02:03:18,675 --> 02:03:21,350
One of your works won a prize
in our cultural center.

2343
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:24,424
-- What's the name of that piece?
-- Melancholy Donkey.

2344
02:03:24,425 --> 02:03:25,924
Melancholy Donkey, yes.

2345
02:03:25,925 --> 02:03:27,174
Chang Mao offered

2346
02:03:27,175 --> 02:03:28,799
to take some pregnancy photos for me.

2347
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,299
Well isn't that a treat.

2348
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:31,300
He won a prize taking photos of donkeys.

2349
02:03:31,301 --> 02:03:34,508
-- With you, it'll be much easier.
-- That's for sure.

2350
02:03:35,550 --> 02:03:36,924
Come closer and look.

2351
02:03:36,925 --> 02:03:38,424
The suburbs of Russia

2352
02:03:38,425 --> 02:03:40,424
is much nicer than ours.

2353
02:03:40,425 --> 02:03:41,549
It really is.

2354
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:42,550
Of course.

2355
02:03:42,551 --> 02:03:44,300
They've developed for so many years.

2356
02:03:46,925 --> 02:03:48,299
Why does the signal tower

2357
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:49,925
have Chinese characters on it?

2358
02:03:56,425 --> 02:03:59,050
That is the evidence of

2359
02:03:59,675 --> 02:04:01,424
the mightiness of our country.

2360
02:04:01,425 --> 02:04:04,049
Not only do we install
base stations abroad,

2361
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:05,674
but also put Chinese Characters on them.

2362
02:04:05,675 --> 02:04:07,925
Not minding that the foreigners
can't read it.

2363
02:04:08,425 --> 02:04:10,675
This is the confidence when we are strong.

2364
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:19,075
Oh my. What's that?

2365
02:04:19,675 --> 02:04:20,800
The Russians

2366
02:04:21,550 --> 02:04:22,800
have hair-loss issues.

2367
02:04:23,925 --> 02:04:24,925
（Russian） Hair.

2368
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:27,925
What are you wearing?

2369
02:04:28,925 --> 02:04:30,924
Why are you wearing the sweater
underneath your shirt?

2370
02:04:30,925 --> 02:04:33,558
It's not neat. Take it off
and change it to the outside.

2371
02:04:34,175 --> 02:04:35,675
Well,

2372
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:42,800
Ma Liang.

2373
02:04:44,175 --> 02:04:45,175
Why is it stuck again?

2374
02:04:45,176 --> 02:04:46,674
Ma Liang.

2375
02:04:46,675 --> 02:04:48,549
Is it because my signal in the house?

2376
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:50,174
Probably because you two are too far apart.

2377
02:04:50,175 --> 02:04:52,174
He is right under the signal tower,

2378
02:04:52,175 --> 02:04:53,695
there is no way he has signal problem.

2379
02:04:54,550 --> 02:04:55,600
Ma Liang.

2380
02:04:57,425 --> 02:04:58,550
Ma Liang.

2381
02:05:00,175 --> 02:05:01,225
Ma Liang.

2382
02:05:01,675 --> 02:05:03,550
What kind of lousy signal is this?

2383
02:05:06,675 --> 02:05:07,675
Over.

2384
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:25,550
Incoming call!

2385
02:05:27,550 --> 02:05:28,675
Sweetheart.

2386
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:30,550
Take a look.

2387
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,300
Look at those baby hands.

2388
02:06:06,300 --> 02:06:07,799
Young man, have you seen
an art exhibition before?

2389
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:09,799
-- No.
-- It's your lucky day then.

2390
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:12,049
Come on. It's my treat for you
to see my husband's collection.

2391
02:06:12,050 --> 02:06:14,174
-- I have things to do.
-- It'll only take three minutes.

2392
02:06:14,175 --> 02:06:15,250
Come on.

2393
02:06:23,675 --> 02:06:24,925
Very good. Bye.

2394
02:07:11,758 --> 02:07:14,841
Huixang Village Archway
Completion Works Ceremony

2395
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:19,424
The turnover of my grocery store

2396
02:07:19,425 --> 02:07:20,924
has doubled.

2397
02:07:20,925 --> 02:07:24,033
I decided to open a branch
in the east of the village.

2398
02:07:25,175 --> 02:07:27,799
Mr. Secretary, the young people who
had migrated to the big cities

2399
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:29,049
are now returning.

2400
02:07:29,050 --> 02:07:30,799
The farms are no longer
short of hands.

2401
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:33,299
Mr. Secretary, we sold more
than 100 kilos of

2402
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:35,299
homemade sausages this week.

2403
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:38,174
-- I will bring some to you.
-- Well, I...it's my wife.

2404
02:07:38,175 --> 02:07:39,175
Shush.

2405
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,174
Hello?

2406
02:07:48,175 --> 02:07:49,175
Honey,

2407
02:07:49,176 --> 02:07:50,674
you 're still in bed.

2408
02:07:50,675 --> 02:07:52,925
Check out my makeup.

2409
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:55,549
I'm about to get my pregnancy photos taken.

2410
02:07:55,550 --> 02:07:58,408
Who is this? So attractive.
Is she my wife?

2411
02:07:58,925 --> 02:08:00,250
You're so annoying.
So full of it.

2412
02:08:01,675 --> 02:08:03,424
Don't wear anything revealing.

2413
02:08:03,425 --> 02:08:04,924
It might affect the baby.

2414
02:08:04,925 --> 02:08:06,174
Rest assured, Mr. Artist.

2415
02:08:06,175 --> 02:08:07,799
We'll take good care of your wife.

2416
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:10,049
Good. Where are you now?

2417
02:08:10,050 --> 02:08:11,050
Don't wander too far.

2418
02:08:11,051 --> 02:08:13,924
Not very far from our home,
there is a new tourist resort.

2419
02:08:13,925 --> 02:08:15,175
Let me show you.

2420
02:08:15,925 --> 02:08:17,424
You see, it's quite popular.

2421
02:08:17,425 --> 02:08:18,675
It is.

2422
02:08:24,425 --> 02:08:25,549
Okay, you take care.

2423
02:08:25,550 --> 02:08:26,675
I'm getting up.

2424
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:32,125
Meeting dismissed.

2425
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:38,008
Keep Our Mission Firmly In Mind

2426
02:08:50,050 --> 02:08:51,650
It's really good.

2427
02:08:52,175 --> 02:08:53,799
They sell everything here.
I want that one.

2428
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,424
No, too many additives.

2429
02:08:55,425 --> 02:08:57,174
-- Barbeque.
-- Barbeque, in your situation?

2430
02:08:57,175 --> 02:08:58,675
You're such a bummer.

2431
02:09:00,550 --> 02:09:02,433
Ice cream. I'll get some.

2432
02:09:03,175 --> 02:09:04,300
Hi, kids.

2433
02:09:19,550 --> 02:09:21,925
Was she my lover from a previous life?

2434
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:24,924
Mr. Chief, ice cream for you.

2435
02:09:24,925 --> 02:09:26,983
-- I really shouldn't take it.
-- Thank you.

2436
02:09:29,675 --> 02:09:30,924
What are you doing?
So reckless.

2437
02:09:30,925 --> 02:09:32,674
-- What?
-- It's me. Ma.

2438
02:09:32,675 --> 02:09:34,424
It's bad. My wife is here.

2439
02:09:34,425 --> 02:09:36,549
-- Where?
-- See?

2440
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:39,549
-- Those three.
-- Yeah.

2441
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:41,049
No wonder she looks so familiar.

2442
02:09:41,050 --> 02:09:42,299
Guard the viewing deck.

2443
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:43,924
Don't let them see the paddy field tableau.

2444
02:09:43,925 --> 02:09:45,424
My wife has seen my sketches.

2445
02:09:45,425 --> 02:09:47,083
-- Okay.
-- Let me think.

2446
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:51,250
Careful, careful.
Popcorn alert!

2447
02:09:57,925 --> 02:09:59,299
I've got an idea.

2448
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:01,299
Let's do a petal throwing set.

2449
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:02,549
We shouldn't pick flowers.

2450
02:10:02,550 --> 02:10:03,799
No, we won't.

2451
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:04,925
I prepare it beforehand.

2452
02:10:05,675 --> 02:10:08,133
Throwing rose petals in a sunflower field?
That's dumb.

2453
02:10:08,675 --> 02:10:10,049
It'll look like we're spitting blood.

2454
02:10:10,050 --> 02:10:11,175
It will look very pretty.

2455
02:10:28,675 --> 02:10:30,708
Cut it out. Go away.
Cut it out. Go away.

2456
02:10:31,175 --> 02:10:33,049
Cut it out. Go away.
Go away.

2457
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:34,799
Go away. Quick.
Go away. Quick.

2458
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,550
Go play over there.

2459
02:10:46,175 --> 02:10:49,125
Brother Goose, could you
help us take some photos?

2460
02:10:50,175 --> 02:10:52,174
Don't be shy.
It won't take long.

2461
02:10:52,175 --> 02:10:53,674
Come on.

2462
02:10:53,675 --> 02:10:55,300
Your costume is mad cute.

2463
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,549
Come on. This way.

2464
02:10:58,550 --> 02:10:59,550
Come.

2465
02:11:00,550 --> 02:11:01,924
Now I got a new idea,

2466
02:11:01,925 --> 02:11:04,174
Let's do an animal set.

2467
02:11:04,175 --> 02:11:05,549
Wow, the big goose

2468
02:11:05,550 --> 02:11:06,674
So cute.

2469
02:11:06,675 --> 02:11:08,175
Hello.

2470
02:11:10,050 --> 02:11:12,049
Look, he's being shy.

2471
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:13,425
Let's take a couple of photos.

2472
02:11:14,675 --> 02:11:15,924
I will just stand here.

2473
02:11:15,925 --> 02:11:17,175
Okay.

2474
02:11:18,175 --> 02:11:20,049
Beautiful.

2475
02:11:20,050 --> 02:11:21,675
Good. Another pose.

2476
02:11:24,175 --> 02:11:25,855
Another one.This time,
not shy, just happy.

2477
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:27,550
Yeah

2478
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:30,575
Make a heart sign.
Good.

2479
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,424
This is a good one.

2480
02:11:51,425 --> 02:11:52,924
Now, hold.

2481
02:11:52,925 --> 02:11:54,675
The lighting is amazing as well.

2482
02:11:58,175 --> 02:11:59,300
I'm holding him.

2483
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:04,425
That's really good.

2484
02:12:09,425 --> 02:12:10,425
Brother Goose.

2485
02:12:11,050 --> 02:12:12,424
Thank you.

2486
02:12:12,425 --> 02:12:13,799
Thank you.

2487
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,050
Bye bye.

2488
02:12:29,675 --> 02:12:30,799
Turn around.

2489
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:31,883
You are unparalleled.

2490
02:13:07,425 --> 02:13:08,800
Sit down and have some rest, Xia.

2491
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:14,424
Thank you, Goose.
Thank you for the food.

2492
02:13:14,425 --> 02:13:16,000
Here. Take a sip of this.

2493
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:18,775
How much is it? Give him the money.

2494
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:23,674
The level of service in this village
is unparalleled.

2495
02:13:23,675 --> 02:13:24,825
Xia, let's go back.

2496
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:27,174
You can't exhaust yourself.

2497
02:13:27,175 --> 02:13:28,549
-- Yeah.
-- I'm fine.

2498
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:30,049
It's just low blood sugar.

2499
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:31,450
I'll be fine after I eat something.

2500
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:34,424
Thank you. Come.

2501
02:13:34,425 --> 02:13:36,049
It's too hot, take off your head wear

2502
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:37,050
and have some water.

2503
02:13:38,425 --> 02:13:40,550
You're such a devoted mascot.

2504
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:43,833
You guys have made this place
really nice.

2505
02:13:51,675 --> 02:13:53,174
Meng Meng, hand me the phone.

2506
02:13:53,175 --> 02:13:54,425
I want to call my husband.

2507
02:14:07,425 --> 02:14:08,924
Why is it so dark on your side?

2508
02:14:08,925 --> 02:14:10,049
Sweetheart,

2509
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:11,174
I keep the light off.

2510
02:14:11,175 --> 02:14:13,049
I don't want to wake up my roommates.

2511
02:14:13,050 --> 02:14:15,424
What time is it?
There should be daylight already.

2512
02:14:15,425 --> 02:14:17,175
Daylight is short over here.

2513
02:14:17,675 --> 02:14:19,924
Let me tell you something really weird.

2514
02:14:19,925 --> 02:14:21,924
The place I am taking pictures today

2515
02:14:21,925 --> 02:14:24,174
looks exactly the same
as the place you do outdoor paintings

2516
02:14:24,175 --> 02:14:25,799
in Russia.

2517
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:26,800
I'm not kidding.

2518
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,174
Look.

2519
02:14:28,175 --> 02:14:29,175
Same, right?

2520
02:14:32,425 --> 02:14:33,549
No,

2521
02:14:33,550 --> 02:14:34,924
Not a little.

2522
02:14:34,925 --> 02:14:36,299
Look harder.

2523
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:37,425
Don't they look alike?

2524
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:40,425
Even the signal towers are
exactly the same.

2525
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:42,424
Honey,

2526
02:14:42,425 --> 02:14:45,174
I suddenly feel that you're
very close to me,

2527
02:14:45,175 --> 02:14:46,800
like right by my side.

2528
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:51,174
Sweetheart,

2529
02:14:51,175 --> 02:14:52,549
you miss me so much that

2530
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:54,050
you're having an illusion.

2531
02:14:58,925 --> 02:15:00,008
Sweetheart,

2532
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:01,674
I just had a bad dream.

2533
02:15:01,675 --> 02:15:02,799
Guess what?

2534
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,049
I dreamt that you fell from a high place.

2535
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:06,175
So today,

2536
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:08,174
high places like rooftop,

2537
02:15:08,175 --> 02:15:09,424
water tower

2538
02:15:09,425 --> 02:15:10,674
and viewing deck

2539
02:15:10,675 --> 02:15:12,799
are off limits. You hear me?

2540
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:15,299
-- Especially viewing decks.
-- I'm pregnant.

2541
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:17,050
What high places do you expect me to climb?

2542
02:15:17,675 --> 02:15:19,275
Alright. I'm hanging up.

2543
02:15:25,925 --> 02:15:27,174
There is a viewing deck.

2544
02:15:27,175 --> 02:15:28,925
Let's go see the paddy field tableau.

2545
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:35,575
What's wrong? You forget to
bring toilet paper?

2546
02:15:48,050 --> 02:15:50,424
(Pregnant woman, long hair photographer,
as well as accompanies are now allowed)

2547
02:15:50,425 --> 02:15:51,799
Damn.

2548
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:53,674
This is specific.

2549
02:15:53,675 --> 02:15:55,300
We're completely ruled out.

2550
02:15:56,175 --> 02:15:57,175
The 'as well as'

2551
02:15:57,176 --> 02:15:58,800
must be referring to me.

2552
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:02,175
Why aren't pregnant women allowed?

2553
02:16:03,425 --> 02:16:04,674
Up there

2554
02:16:04,675 --> 02:16:05,925
has been freshly painted.

2555
02:16:07,050 --> 02:16:08,424
Formaldehyde is above
the maximum level.

2556
02:16:08,425 --> 02:16:10,049
Photographers?

2557
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:11,549
The paddy field tableau

2558
02:16:11,550 --> 02:16:13,049
involves business secrets.

2559
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:15,549
Professional photographers are
not allowed to access for the moment.

2560
02:16:15,550 --> 02:16:18,174
What about the long hair?

2561
02:16:18,175 --> 02:16:20,674
According to international conventions,
photographers with long hair tend to be

2562
02:16:20,675 --> 02:16:21,800
more professional.

2563
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:23,674
And the 'as well as',

2564
02:16:23,675 --> 02:16:25,425
how did you predict that?

2565
02:16:26,425 --> 02:16:27,924
Aren't you traveling together?

2566
02:16:27,925 --> 02:16:30,049
-- Yeah.
-- Then that's it.

2567
02:16:30,050 --> 02:16:31,050
A country has its laws

2568
02:16:31,051 --> 02:16:32,299
and a village has its rules.

2569
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:33,799
After your baby is born.

2570
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:35,174
After you cut your hair,

2571
02:16:35,175 --> 02:16:36,424
and after you grow up,

2572
02:16:36,425 --> 02:16:38,424
I will welcome you with gongs and drums,

2573
02:16:38,425 --> 02:16:41,174
guiding you through every corner
of this village.

2574
02:16:41,175 --> 02:16:42,425
Now, go home.

2575
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:44,549
Did we offend anyone?

2576
02:16:44,550 --> 02:16:46,549
This is going too far.

2577
02:16:46,550 --> 02:16:48,300
As an apology

2578
02:16:48,925 --> 02:16:50,549
we offer some local products

2579
02:16:50,550 --> 02:16:52,299
for the three of you.

2580
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:53,980
After all, there aren't many
tourist groups

2581
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:56,425
that meet all the criteria.

2582
02:17:04,050 --> 02:17:05,300
Congratulations.

2583
02:17:12,925 --> 02:17:15,174
This village has a fair amount of rules.

2584
02:17:15,175 --> 02:17:17,674
But I do appreciate the way
they handle complaints.

2585
02:17:17,675 --> 02:17:20,800
I love my dancing hair.

2586
02:17:34,050 --> 02:17:36,549
Honey, look, the photos
I took today.

2587
02:17:36,550 --> 02:17:37,925
Are they beautiful?

2588
02:17:44,175 --> 02:17:46,299
This sausage is really tasty.
Xia, try it.

2589
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:48,050
The sausage from that village is so yummy.

2590
02:17:55,050 --> 02:17:57,049
This sausage tastes the same

2591
02:17:57,050 --> 02:17:59,049
as the ones sent by Ma Liang
from Russia.

2592
02:17:59,050 --> 02:18:00,050
It does?

2593
02:18:00,051 --> 02:18:01,925
It's from the guy in the village.

2594
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:15,425
Turn around.

2595
02:18:19,050 --> 02:18:20,675
We haven't left anything behind.

2596
02:18:21,425 --> 02:18:22,799
What happened?

2597
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:24,050
Say something?

2598
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:52,175
Isn't that Mr. Ma?

2599
02:18:53,050 --> 02:18:54,050
Xia.

2600
02:18:57,300 --> 02:19:00,049
Thank God, I was cool at the time.

2601
02:19:00,050 --> 02:19:01,799
With a few boxes of local products,

2602
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:03,049
I sent them away.

2603
02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:04,050
Wow!

2604
02:19:04,051 --> 02:19:05,799
In order to deal with this tigress,

2605
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:07,549
I spent so much time

2606
02:19:07,550 --> 02:19:09,674
practicing trilling words
with Mr. Secretary.

2607
02:19:09,675 --> 02:19:11,049
Do you know how to say Tigress

2608
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:12,425
in Russian?

2609
02:19:12,925 --> 02:19:14,300
（Russian） Tigress

2610
02:19:15,050 --> 02:19:16,050
Teacup.

2611
02:19:16,550 --> 02:19:17,799
（Russian） Teacup

2612
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:19,424
Nice to meet you.

2613
02:19:19,425 --> 02:19:22,300
（Russian） Nice to meet you

2614
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:25,275
If you are meeting people
for the first time, then you --

2615
02:19:32,175 --> 02:19:33,549
No tipping off!

2616
02:19:33,550 --> 02:19:34,633
Freeze!

2617
02:19:36,425 --> 02:19:37,800
You move, you get a photo.

2618
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:12,550
Calabash Dolls.

2619
02:20:58,925 --> 02:21:00,425
Who's that?

2620
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:06,549
Outrageous.

2621
02:21:06,550 --> 02:21:07,925
Give the toilet paper back.

2622
02:21:45,675 --> 02:21:46,799
Where are you?

2623
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,675
We are here.

2624
02:21:56,300 --> 02:21:57,425
I'm here.

2625
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:29,175
Qiu Xia,

2626
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:32,675
there is something that
I have been hiding from you.

2627
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:38,175
I meant to confess to you
after our baby's birth.

2628
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:43,300
You know I grew up in a small village

2629
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:47,675
where I believe is the
most beautiful place in the world.

2630
02:22:49,550 --> 02:22:51,300
But now,

2631
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:54,300
many villages are getting old,

2632
02:22:54,925 --> 02:22:57,175
all the young people have left,

2633
02:22:58,675 --> 02:23:00,049
and I've been thinking

2634
02:23:00,050 --> 02:23:02,300
what can I do for this?

2635
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,300
So,

2636
02:23:10,425 --> 02:23:11,550
So what?

2637
02:23:18,550 --> 02:23:20,175
Ma Liang, you got new skills.

2638
02:23:20,675 --> 02:23:22,800
You led the whole village to fool me.

2639
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:24,925
Please forgive him.

2640
02:23:25,550 --> 02:23:26,800
Please.

2641
02:23:34,050 --> 02:23:36,050
You gave up Repin for this.

2642
02:23:37,675 --> 02:23:38,924
I thought the first secretary

2643
02:23:38,925 --> 02:23:40,550
must be having a good time.

2644
02:23:41,425 --> 02:23:43,300
But I heard that

2645
02:23:43,925 --> 02:23:45,925
you don't even have time for proper meals.

2646
02:23:48,175 --> 02:23:49,675
You're not making much money.

2647
02:23:50,300 --> 02:23:51,674
And you give your wage

2648
02:23:51,675 --> 02:23:53,799
together with the allowance I sent you

2649
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:55,424
to the old widows

2650
02:23:55,425 --> 02:23:57,175
and young widows in the village.

2651
02:24:00,050 --> 02:24:01,300
And widowers too.

2652
02:24:03,675 --> 02:24:05,400
No. Don't beat him.

2653
02:24:20,675 --> 02:24:22,300
I've been bragging to everyone I met,

2654
02:24:23,175 --> 02:24:25,300
telling them that my husband
got accepted by Repin.

2655
02:24:26,300 --> 02:24:27,650
The only one in Northeast China.

2656
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:32,425
My parents used to say
that you were unaccomplished.

2657
02:24:33,675 --> 02:24:36,300
Now they all call you a late bloomer.

2658
02:24:38,300 --> 02:24:39,675
But now,

2659
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:43,925
I'm sorry.

2660
02:24:52,050 --> 02:24:53,050
But now,

2661
02:24:54,050 --> 02:24:55,550
I will ask my parents

2662
02:24:56,425 --> 02:24:57,675
and all my friends

2663
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,925
to come here and see it for themselves.

2664
02:25:02,050 --> 02:25:03,925
I'm going to tell them proudly

2665
02:25:04,675 --> 02:25:06,049
that my husband

2666
02:25:06,050 --> 02:25:08,425
got admitted by Repin
but he chose not to go.

2667
02:25:10,550 --> 02:25:13,175
Because he chose a much nobler cause.

2668
02:25:18,425 --> 02:25:20,050
To satisfy the needs of the people

2669
02:25:22,175 --> 02:25:26,424
Hui people, and people of all
ethnic groups across the country...

2670
02:25:26,425 --> 02:25:28,549
Enough, Honey.

2671
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:30,900
This is a viewing deck,
not a rostrum.

2672
02:25:33,675 --> 02:25:34,800
Sweetheart

2673
02:25:35,550 --> 02:25:38,675
you are the greatest artist in the world.

2674
02:26:10,425 --> 02:26:11,924
I wish the best for my hometown

2675
02:26:11,925 --> 02:26:13,549
and a good life for everyone there.

2676
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:16,674
I hope my hometown would soon
get rid of poverty.

2677
02:26:16,675 --> 02:26:19,049
And become a glamorous metropolis.

2678
02:26:19,050 --> 02:26:22,924
Our beef meatballs would take
the world by storm.

2679
02:26:22,925 --> 02:26:25,049
I want them to be sweet.

2680
02:26:25,050 --> 02:26:26,799
I heart Xinjiang.

2681
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:29,799
Mom,dad,you guys don't have
to worry about me.

2682
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,424
I'm a grownup now.

2683
02:26:31,425 --> 02:26:33,674
I've always wanted to go to the Nadam Fair.

2684
02:26:33,675 --> 02:26:35,549
Now I'm at the Nadam Fair everyday.

2685
02:26:35,550 --> 02:26:38,549
Hopefully, we don't have to leave
our home for big cities.

2686
02:26:38,550 --> 02:26:41,049
And small towns could
also have a better future and soon.

2687
02:26:41,050 --> 02:26:42,549
I wish my mom back home

2688
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:45,549
would enjoy her life every day,

2689
02:26:45,550 --> 02:26:46,800
waiting for me to return.
