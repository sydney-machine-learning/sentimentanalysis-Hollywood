1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,476
That's your man.

2
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,771
- Draw your pay.
- You wanted him broken.

3
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,440
Yeah, but not ruined.

4
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,817
Now, get out of here.

5
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,131
Mr. Marshall.

6
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,556
Ever heard of a J.W. Grant?

7
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,350
He needs you. Urgent.

8
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,909
My husband.

9
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,665
Hurry. Hurry.

10
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,836
Please, hurry.

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,756
Get out of here.

12
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,217
Baby!

13
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,706
It's nice to see you.

14
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:15,294
I'm Joe Grant.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Ehrengard.

15
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,673
Got your telegram, Mr. Grant.

16
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,342
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sharp.

17
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:14,269
Yeah. Me too, Lizzie.

18
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:18,023
Mr. Grant, I'm your local
bank representative.

19
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,817
As per your instructions,
this box contains...

20
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,903
Thank you for coming, Mr. Fardan.

21
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,448
The receipt, Mr. Grant.

22
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:29,367
Exactly $100,000 in gold coins.

23
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:33,621
Not a coin larger than $50.
That's quite an unusual request.

24
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:37,124
Thank you. Move out.

25
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:40,503
Mr. Grant. Slow freight ahead.

26
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:43,798
- Sidetrack it.
- You should count the money.

27
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:47,676
- Didn't you count it?
- Well, yes, of course, but...

28
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:57,561
Thank you.

29
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:13,868
Henry "Rico" Fardan. Virginia Military
Academy, Philippine campaign...

30
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:17,373
...Cuba with Roosevelt's Rough
Riders. Married a Mexican woman.

31
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,416
No children. Wife deceased.

32
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,586
Joined Pancho Villa
as weapons expert and tactician.

33
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:27,674
Your hair was darker then.

34
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:31,345
My heart was lighter then.

35
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:36,892
Left Villa's forces, June, 1915.

36
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,562
A year of wildcatting and prospecting.
Results: Negative.

37
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,150
Now demonstrating automatic
weapons. Salary: $40 a week.

38
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:50,739
Hans Ehrengard. Ex-cavalryman,
cattle boss, wrangler...

39
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:53,074
...bull-whacker, packmaster.

40
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,371
Jacob Sharp. Specialist with rifle,
rope and longbow.

41
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:01,791
Most dependable scout and tracker
in the territory.

42
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:05,880
Any objections to working
with a Negro?

43
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:09,257
What's the job, Mr. Grant?

44
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:13,803
How well do you know him?

45
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:17,724
- Well enough.
- What's your feeling toward him?

46
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:20,268
I have the highest respect for him...

47
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:22,812
...as a soldier.

48
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,485
Last week, your respected soldier
kidnapped my wife.

49
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:33,572
His ransom note.

50
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:36,201
Your job:

51
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:40,330
A mission of mercy.

52
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:45,835
Raza. Captain Jesus Raza.

53
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:49,048
Jesus.

54
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:54,594
What a name for the bloodiest
cutthroat in Mexico.

55
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:13,405
Mrs. Grant is a prisoner
about 100 miles across this desert.

56
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:17,867
A hellhole. For Raza, a fortress.

57
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:20,203
He was born in that desert.

58
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:26,166
He and his men know every ravine,
every rock, every cliff.

59
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:29,086
It'd take a battalion at least a month.

60
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:32,673
But a few daring men...

61
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:35,968
...specialists, led by you...

62
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:40,180
...could do it in one bold, swift stroke.

63
00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:44,643
Why not? You're fluent in Spanish.
You know the terrain.

64
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,312
You know Raza.
How he thinks and reacts.

65
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,526
- I know you can do it.
- I don't think so, Mr. Grant.

66
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:56,196
One thousand dollars a man going in.

67
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:58,949
If you bring her back safe and sound...

68
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:02,661
...another 9000 dollars
for each of you.

69
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,005
- How many men does Raza have?
- Pasqual?

70
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:15,924
Last month, 150, maybe. Now?

71
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:19,843
- If I were you, I'd pay the ransom.
- There it is.

72
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:25,976
One hundred thousand dollars
in gold coins, as requested by Raza.

73
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:31,565
Will that guarantee that she
won't be killed? You know Raza.

74
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,985
Say we were lucky enough
to get there.

75
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:37,488
How do we get your wife out? Safely?

76
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:43,410
Gentlemen, I don't know
where else to turn.

77
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:47,997
- What we really need is an equalizer.
- Name it.

78
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:52,001
A dynamiter with a delicate touch
to blow out a candle...

79
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:54,753
...without denting the candleholder.
- Who?

80
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:57,591
Him.

81
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:02,638
Arrange to have that man at the train
where we pick up the horses.

82
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:04,640
- Where is he?
- Not far.

83
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,183
- Get the details.
- In jail.

84
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:13,063
- In jail?
- He says that $700 will bail him out.

85
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:18,694
But is he dependable?
Can he be trusted?

86
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:20,779
I trust him.

87
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:23,658
Then you've got him.

88
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:09,536
- Rico, buddy, I don't deserve you.
- I agree.

89
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:19,172
I can understand you getting
into a crap game and losing $700...

90
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:22,633
...but how'd you lose your pants?
- In a lady's bedroom.

91
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:26,763
Trying to raise the cash.
Almost had it made too.

92
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:32,016
You realise people are the only
animals who make love face to face?

93
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,977
He's all yours.

94
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:38,231
Thanks. Again.

95
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:42,903
You could have telegraphed
the money yesterday.

96
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:46,365
Yesterday, I didn't have the money.

97
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:50,452
What's the proposition?

98
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:53,872
You won't lose your pants.

99
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:58,084
Your life, maybe, but... what's that?

100
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:01,379
Hardly anything at all.

101
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:06,634
- Well?
- Nice animals.

102
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:10,012
- Picked by Mr. Ortega.
- You can depend on them.

103
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,226
This one is Mrs. Grant's favourite.

104
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:18,647
Bred for speed.

105
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,567
He'll need a lot more than that
for this job.

106
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:28,573
- You'll have to make them do.
- Mr. Grant...

107
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:33,453
...I can make them go,
but I can't make them do.

108
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:39,751
$100,000 for a wife?
She must be a lot of woman.

109
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:43,254
Certain women have a way
of changing some boys into men...

110
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:47,174
...and some men back into boys.
- That's a woman worth saving.

111
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:51,637
- Where are we going?
- The Painted Mountains.

112
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,848
That's right.

113
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:59,520
- You want us to go back to Mexico?
- This time strictly for cash.

114
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:05,777
- What's the deal?
- $10,000 per man, for nine days' work.

115
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:12,033
More money than we ever realised
out of all our schemes put together.

116
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,243
No detours!

117
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:19,706
I made us a contract. All the way.

118
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:23,877
- They know who took the woman?
- Raza.

119
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:32,011
Our Raza? A kidnapper?

120
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:36,682
- Grant's got a ransom note to prove it.
- Well, I'll be damned.

121
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,893
Most of us are.

122
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:17,096
Last week Mrs. Grant went riding.

123
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,933
Across the border.

124
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,812
She was born in Mexico.

125
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,524
I suppose she got lonely for it.

126
00:14:29,277 --> 00:14:32,945
By the time we were alarmed,
the note of ransom arrived.

127
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:35,447
You'll want to know how she looks.

128
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:39,535
Those were taken four years ago
on our wedding day.

129
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:46,251
I guess I'm not much good without her.
Not anymore.

130
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:50,713
- What part of the hacienda is she kept?
- I'd only be guessing.

131
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:52,591
We have to know.

132
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,470
- The goat-keeper must know.
- Is he still there?

133
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:04,226
- What goat-keeper?
- By name, Padillia. Eduardo Padillia.

134
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:07,605
He was devoted to Mrs. Grant.

135
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:13,403
Twice a day he brought her
goat's milk. It was almost a ritual.

136
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:17,574
By this, he will know
you have my blessing.

137
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:27,207
Like myself, he would give his life
for the seÃ±ora.

138
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:31,753
When you cross under that bridge,
you're in Mexico.

139
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:37,342
You'll leave as soon as it's dark.
It's safer to travel by night, rest by day.

140
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,688
Bring her back to me.

141
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,358
Please.

142
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:59,967
We've been following
the same tracks.

143
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:02,094
- Mexicans.
- How many horses?

144
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:03,845
Eight. More likely 10.

145
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:05,847
- How long ago?
- Couple hours.

146
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:09,767
- Which way they headed?
- Same as us, south. Only, circling.

147
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:16,107
Now, why should they circle?

148
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,110
Raza's men?

149
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:21,570
- Why not?
- This far north?

150
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,739
That's a good question.

151
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:27,118
Could be anybody. Even friendly.

152
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:30,913
- Could be.
- Jake, shag them. Look them over.

153
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,749
But just look.

154
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,711
We'll camp at Dead Man's Canyon.
Spot us by the Painted Hills.

155
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:38,671
I'll find you.

156
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:22,048
Rico. You know something?

157
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:25,301
Me and Raza are the two
most corruptible bums.

158
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:28,260
- We'd do most anything for money.
- And have.

159
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:32,432
But not kidnapping.
That's not our trade.

160
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,019
Why did Raza pick Grant's wife
to kidnap?

161
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:43,235
Company. Eight.
Next bend up ahead.

162
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:47,031
- Last night you saw tracks for 10.
- That's right.

163
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:49,200
- Any cover?
- Both sides.

164
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:53,788
Cut out your two horses
and the dynamite mule.

165
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,640
- Maybe they're just passing.
- If so, they'll ride in single file.

166
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:19,271
The leader in front, and they'll palaver.
If it's trouble, they'll come as a group.

167
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:24,066
If the leader takes his hat off and
passes it across to cover his gun...

168
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:26,403
...let go, fast.

169
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:38,789
- Bill, you take the point.
- They got bolt-action rifles.

170
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:49,758
- Same setup as Durango?
- Yeah. Why not?

171
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:04,064
- They're here.
- They're here.

172
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:35,971
Good morning, friends.

173
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:37,723
Good morning.

174
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:39,266
They're Americans.

175
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:42,770
- You got lost?
- Just looking for a place to camp.

176
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,483
What you got in those packs, boss?
Gold?

177
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:51,195
You got more gold in your teeth.

178
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:54,782
He says I've got more gold
in my teeth. How funny!

179
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:58,410
- It's very dangerous around here.
- Oh, that so?

180
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:02,164
Sure. Many bandits
hide in these mountains.

181
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:05,334
Very bad men.
They steal from anybody.

182
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:10,004
- Especially gringos.
- In that case, we'd better keep moving.

183
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,631
Go with God.

184
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:44,539
- That makes 10.
- That's right.

185
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,295
Shoot the horse. Shoot him!

186
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:18,698
- Bury them deep.
- Nine more of their horses are still left.

187
00:22:18,991 --> 00:22:23,286
- You gonna shoot them too?
- We can't spare the food and water.

188
00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:25,954
You can turn them loose.

189
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:29,082
- What's so funny?
- People.

190
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:32,711
We just killed 10 men.
Nobody bats an eye.

191
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:37,049
- When it comes to a stupid animal...
- But harmless.

192
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:41,511
Nothing's harmless in the desert,
unless it's dead.

193
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:45,099
Want to face another pack
of Raza's men?

194
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:49,645
- They'll head south, to camp.
- They'll head to the river, north.

195
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:52,522
Suppose they follow us? What then?

196
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,900
Then shoot them.

197
00:23:00,573 --> 00:23:02,366
All right. Cut them loose.

198
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:03,051
God almighty.

199
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:07,848
I've known heat before, but this is...

200
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:14,270
I hate the desert.

201
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:18,692
It's got no pity.

202
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:23,405
Jake.

203
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:31,036
- Did he take his salt?
- I'll see that he gets some.

204
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:45,259
Let him sleep. You too.

205
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:03,569
How they taking it?

206
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:06,864
They'll be all right.

207
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:11,952
You'd better scout ahead tonight.

208
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:15,831
Now, beyond that ridge,
20 miles of salt flats.

209
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:19,877
Then 10 more of sand.
220 degrees south by southwest.

210
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:23,130
Our next layover, Coyote Pass.

211
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:27,593
The cemetery of nameless men.

212
00:25:29,512 --> 00:25:32,222
We buried some fine friends there.

213
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:37,645
And some fine enemies.

214
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:39,979
That was a fine battle.

215
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:44,235
Outnumbered, outgunned,
and still we held that pass.

216
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:49,073
Yeah, but who cares now?
Or even remembers?

217
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:51,575
Now, take that ruckus this morning.

218
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:57,538
A year ago, those men would be
fighting federals instead of gringos.

219
00:25:57,705 --> 00:26:00,415
- We were lucky.
- We were also stiffed.

220
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:04,379
They had us spotted back
where we picked up their trail.

221
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:10,343
- Why did they sucker us into this spot?
- You're leery about the setup too. So?

222
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:14,722
Amigo, three days' ride from
Coyote Pass is another graveyard.

223
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,726
But instead of dead heroes,
they buried gold bullion.

224
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:23,064
Two million in Spanish gold.
Melted down into beautiful bars.

225
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:26,900
Waiting for us.
We don't have to fight Raza to get it.

226
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:30,947
- It's not the reason you took this job.
- Got a better reason?

227
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:35,577
Our word. We gave our word
to bring the woman back.

228
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:41,791
My word to Grant
ain't worth a plugged nickel.

229
00:26:42,543 --> 00:26:45,086
You gave your word to me.

230
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,169
Drink?

231
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,420
Thanks.

232
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:13,924
Yeah, takes getting used to.

233
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:20,389
Broiling by day. Freezing at night.
Alkali dust choking your body.

234
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:23,809
Who lives here long enough
to get used to it?

235
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:27,603
Men, tempered like steel,
a tough breed.

236
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:30,274
Men who've learned how to endure.

237
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:33,652
- Like you and Dolworth.
- Oh, no.

238
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,946
Men like Raza.

239
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:02,637
I wonder how long that's been there.

240
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:06,892
About an hour or so.
Dolworth put it there.

241
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:12,189
That means everything's all clear.
An upside-down cross means danger.

242
00:29:14,526 --> 00:29:18,029
- Could've been put there by anybody.
- That's the idea.

243
00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:53,540
Good morning, friend.

244
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:14,893
- Dolworth?
- Yeah.

245
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:17,604
- How many more?
- Three.

246
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:37,250
No guns.

247
00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:39,835
- We that close to Raza?
- Could be.

248
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:02,274
At least I made out with a fine pistol.

249
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,779
We sure got lucky with this gringo, eh?

250
00:32:06,946 --> 00:32:10,741
No wonder my mother kicked me
out of the house!

251
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:14,828
- A bottle.
- You'd even frighten the dead!

252
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:19,666
Don't get carried away.

253
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:22,336
The bottle.

254
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:25,297
Where are your friends, amigo?

255
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:33,137
Here have a drink.
These shoes will be mine if they fit.

256
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:38,268
- Hey, don't I know you?
- Well, from here you look like me.

257
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:44,858
- Why you come to this place?
- You'll laugh.

258
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:51,323
It is not proper to laugh at a man
who is about to die.

259
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:54,408
I came because I'm crazy
about your tequila.

260
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:56,702
And I like your women.

261
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,498
See? You laugh.

262
00:33:02,501 --> 00:33:05,544
What a funny guy, huh?

263
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:14,221
I'm gonna ask again.
Where are your friends?

264
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:17,349
I told you. I always travel alone.

265
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:23,187
It is a sacrilege to die
with a lie in your teeth.

266
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:25,816
See?

267
00:33:28,276 --> 00:33:33,446
Those horses and six more
come back to us.

268
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:37,450
But where are the men
who ride them?

269
00:33:37,953 --> 00:33:43,583
I don't think you kill 10 men
by yourself, buddy.

270
00:33:45,044 --> 00:33:46,294
Hold it!

271
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:48,130
Stop!

272
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:54,427
I wouldn't do that.

273
00:33:56,513 --> 00:34:01,142
My friend would die of a terrible
headache. And so would you.

274
00:34:04,229 --> 00:34:06,814
And so would you.

275
00:34:09,943 --> 00:34:14,362
So wouldn't it be more sensible
if we both kept our heads, huh?

276
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,282
Put down your gun.

277
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:22,288
If I did that, how do I know
that you would still be friendly?

278
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:30,378
Do I gotta kill you
to prove I like you?

279
00:34:30,547 --> 00:34:33,089
Your gun, mister.

280
00:34:33,382 --> 00:34:36,635
That's why I like this fool,
because he's intelligent.

281
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:40,095
- Behave!
- Behave. Let it drop.

282
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:43,850
That's why I like this one,
because he's so intelligent.

283
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:45,852
Thattaboy.

284
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:48,563
Come on, buddy.

285
00:34:49,482 --> 00:34:50,689
Let it go already.

286
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:53,277
He's a good man after all.

287
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:26,476
You have to get over this habit
of losing your pants.

288
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:29,230
- It's not dignified.
- It's draughty too.

289
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:42,867
- Don't worry. This time I'll do it.
- This time we need them.

290
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:47,956
You all right?

291
00:35:51,794 --> 00:35:55,004
Makes you wonder
how we ever beat the Indians.

292
00:35:57,007 --> 00:35:58,467
Thanks.

293
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:02,846
Interesting pass.

294
00:36:03,013 --> 00:36:05,431
You should see it from upside down.

295
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,396
If we hightail it out of here in a hurry,
that doorway could save us hours.

296
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,775
It's the same shortcut for Raza.

297
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:20,529
Not if you rig it
so we slam that door in his face.

298
00:36:20,698 --> 00:36:21,741
Yeah?

299
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:31,767
I'll take the first watch.

300
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:41,543
If it isn't hot, it's cold.
If it isn't cold, it's raining.

301
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:43,879
How bad is that horse?

302
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:48,175
- Not too good. No bottom.
- We could all do with a rest.

303
00:38:48,384 --> 00:38:49,427
Yeah.

304
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:53,096
- A shave would be a relief.
- So would a bath.

305
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:55,515
Might as well throw in a woman.

306
00:38:55,684 --> 00:38:59,646
Any size, any age, any colour.
Any woman.

307
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:01,772
Mr. D...

308
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,109
...whatever got a loving man like you
in the dynamite business?

309
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:10,572
I'll tell you. I was born
with a powerful passion to create.

310
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,951
I can't write, I can't paint,
I can't make up a song.

311
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:17,579
- So you explode things.
- That's how the world was born.

312
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:19,665
Biggest damn explosion ever.

313
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,043
Dynamite in the hands of a fool
means death.

314
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:27,588
In this case it could mean life. Ours.
If we're lucky...

315
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:31,343
...and get back to this rattrap,
it'll be touch-and-go.

316
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:34,179
All you gotta do is light this fuse.

317
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:39,518
You got 10 seconds to run like hell.

318
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:45,482
And then dynamite, not faith,
will move that mountain into this pass.

319
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,609
Peace, brother.

320
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:09,881
That track is the main line
to Mexico City.

321
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:15,137
According to this, Grant's railroad spur
branches off three miles up.

322
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:18,599
Beyond those hills... the hacienda.

323
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:25,896
Supply train.

324
00:40:26,272 --> 00:40:30,443
- Government troops.
- Well, look here.

325
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,335
Raza.

326
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:15,946
Throw it!

327
00:41:17,532 --> 00:41:19,201
Pull it!

328
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:29,603
- How are you, man?
- Good, chief. Thank you.

329
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:49,830
- Are they all Reds?
- Yes, Captain, they all are.

330
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:55,169
Well, you know what to do.

331
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:33,958
- Justice.
- Shut up!

332
00:43:46,138 --> 00:43:50,473
The men on that train are Colorados.
Expert marksmen.

333
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:53,268
Also expert at torture.

334
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:57,272
Years ago, they burned and looted
a town of 3000 people.

335
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,151
When they finished, 40 were left.

336
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,613
Fardan's wife was one of the lucky 40.

337
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,698
"Why are you a revolutionary?"
They asked her.

338
00:44:07,867 --> 00:44:11,995
"To rid the world of scum like you,"
she said.

339
00:44:12,164 --> 00:44:14,665
They stripped her naked...

340
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:19,085
...ran her through the cactus
until her flesh was...

341
00:44:21,505 --> 00:44:25,299
The other 39 rebels
watched her die...

342
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,927
...and did nothing.

343
00:44:28,095 --> 00:44:29,971
Just watched.

344
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:38,146
What were Americans
doing in a Mexican revolution?

345
00:44:39,982 --> 00:44:44,903
Maybe there's only one revolution,
since the beginning.

346
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:47,989
The good guys against the bad guys.

347
00:44:48,157 --> 00:44:52,077
The question is:
Who are the good guys?

348
00:45:25,277 --> 00:45:28,905
- Juanito, to the north and south, okay?
- Got it.

349
00:45:45,714 --> 00:45:48,424
About 60 horses, four burros.

350
00:45:56,517 --> 00:45:59,602
Two machine guns from the train.

351
00:46:13,616 --> 00:46:14,659
Jake.

352
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:18,245
Keep those horses quiet.

353
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:27,003
Get some more from the other side.
Hurry.

354
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,341
You rode well today, honey.

355
00:46:31,509 --> 00:46:33,301
Perfectly.

356
00:46:34,762 --> 00:46:36,805
Beautiful.

357
00:46:41,352 --> 00:46:45,564
- That Mrs. Grant?
- That is a soldier.

358
00:46:46,023 --> 00:46:51,194
Lieutenant Si Si Chiquita.
Now, there's a woman worth a ransom.

359
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:53,362
She never says no.

360
00:46:56,575 --> 00:47:01,495
Before you blow a gasket,
think you can blow the water tower?

361
00:47:02,582 --> 00:47:07,961
- How do you want it?
- Like it was hit with a French 75.

362
00:47:09,547 --> 00:47:12,716
Mrs. Grant could be there.

363
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:17,888
- Seems the only likely place.
- The trouble is, we gotta be dead sure.

364
00:47:18,055 --> 00:47:20,931
When we make our move,
there won't be time for guessing.

365
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:23,058
Coming through the gate.

366
00:47:23,226 --> 00:47:28,397
- Morning. How's the wife and kids?
- Very good, very good.

367
00:47:28,565 --> 00:47:31,692
Wow, there's a lot of you here.

368
00:47:38,785 --> 00:47:41,912
Anybody see any cows?

369
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,163
No.

370
00:47:45,415 --> 00:47:49,877
It's a cinch that milk didn't
come from the breast of a tin can.

371
00:47:51,546 --> 00:47:54,632
Our friend, the goat-keeper.

372
00:48:19,491 --> 00:48:21,283
Good morning, sir.

373
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:27,498
- What is your name?
- Eduardo Padillia, at your service.

374
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:30,876
Do you recognise this?

375
00:48:39,218 --> 00:48:40,927
Friends of Mr. Ortega.

376
00:48:41,177 --> 00:48:42,971
That's right.

377
00:48:43,722 --> 00:48:47,685
The milk that you brought
to the hacienda this morning...

378
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:50,938
Who was that for?

379
00:48:53,108 --> 00:48:56,986
- Who drinks it?
- Many people.

380
00:48:57,154 --> 00:48:59,530
Anybody special?

381
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:05,326
The lady. SeÃ±ora Grant.

382
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:10,789
She live in that room? You're sure?

383
00:49:10,957 --> 00:49:15,085
- You have seen her?
- I know her from when she was born.

384
00:49:15,254 --> 00:49:21,050
Her mother was dry. She was raised
on the milk of my goats.

385
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,597
- Is she well?
- Very well, considering.

386
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:27,933
We have come to help her.

387
00:49:28,727 --> 00:49:31,101
Blessed be the Lord.

388
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:34,898
May God repay you. May God...

389
00:49:43,823 --> 00:49:48,453
Raza has to expect one of two things:
A messenger with a ransom...

390
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:51,164
...or an attack from the federales.

391
00:49:51,332 --> 00:49:54,375
We've gotta make him think
we're the Mexican army.

392
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:58,587
- The four of us?
- A whole battalion.

393
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,509
Now, how do the federales
start an attack? Artillery.

394
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,348
This is our battery of field guns.

395
00:50:08,516 --> 00:50:11,725
First you hit him here. French 75s.
Then here, here, here.

396
00:50:11,893 --> 00:50:14,103
Carefully avoiding Mrs. Grant.

397
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:18,816
- When they run to defend the...
- We rescue Little Red Riding Hood.

398
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:25,279
We can't fight our way in.
Diversion is our only chance.

399
00:50:29,077 --> 00:50:30,119
Well?

400
00:50:31,705 --> 00:50:34,873
Rico, buddy, I got one of my feelings.

401
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:38,210
Something's dicey about this.
Let's pull out.

402
00:50:40,755 --> 00:50:46,885
If you can deliver this dynamite
with split-second timing...

403
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:49,221
...we can pull this job off.

404
00:51:08,324 --> 00:51:09,576
Mr. D?

405
00:51:10,618 --> 00:51:13,997
I guess we just gotta get lucky.

406
00:51:15,914 --> 00:51:21,420
Jacob, this stick of dynamite
weighs exactly four ounces.

407
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:26,632
If you taped that to an arrow,
how far could you shoot it?

408
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,260
And hit the mark.

409
00:51:50,115 --> 00:51:51,532
I don't like it.

410
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,037
- We get it wrong?
- Relax.

411
00:51:55,204 --> 00:52:01,043
The stuff you're handling is safe.
These beaded sticks are trickier.

412
00:52:01,211 --> 00:52:03,377
It's the heat.

413
00:52:04,631 --> 00:52:08,381
Makes them sweat. Nitro.

414
00:52:18,185 --> 00:52:21,771
When they're dry and cool,
they're safe and obedient.

415
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,982
We'll leave these sweaty ones behind.

416
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:31,405
Ventilate them. Cool them.
Then maybe they'll behave.

417
00:52:31,658 --> 00:52:34,533
I don't know whether it's me
or the dynamite...

418
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,119
...that's doing all that sweating.

419
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:48,213
Four men against so many.
How will you save the seÃ±ora?

420
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:53,010
- I don't know yet.
- When will it happen?

421
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,515
- Tomorrow. Maybe the next day.
- Not before?

422
00:52:57,683 --> 00:53:03,436
- There's much to prepare.
- Speak plainly, seÃ±or.

423
00:53:03,604 --> 00:53:06,064
Am I your prisoner?

424
00:53:06,232 --> 00:53:10,443
I want to help the seÃ±ora.
But you make me feel unworthy.

425
00:53:10,611 --> 00:53:12,279
Trouble!

426
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,751
Show us if you're worthy.
Go greet them.

427
00:53:25,919 --> 00:53:30,881
And remember,
I speak your language.

428
00:53:40,474 --> 00:53:43,435
They don't give good milk
if they're skinny.

429
00:53:56,698 --> 00:53:58,616
What happened, old man?

430
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:01,412
Any news?

431
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:07,042
- Talk!
- Same as always. Very hot weather.

432
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,754
- Have you seen anyone around here?
- No.

433
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:12,297
A gringo maybe?

434
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:16,509
- Gringo?
- Yeah, a gringo.

435
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:21,432
Are you sure?

436
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:44,496
They killed and buried ten of our men.

437
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,915
They found the men
we buried in the canyon.

438
00:55:25,453 --> 00:55:27,830
Am I worthy?

439
00:55:55,066 --> 00:55:59,778
If I were you, Jacob, I wouldn't use
any of these for firewood.

440
00:56:06,452 --> 00:56:09,745
Excuse me. I am ready to leave.

441
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:15,084
- Shall I tell the seÃ±ora of your coming?
- No.

442
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:19,590
- She might behave differently.
- I understand.

443
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:24,303
By tomorrow, God willing,
the seÃ±ora will be safe.

444
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:29,141
Until later, then.

445
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:35,104
So you let him go.

446
00:56:36,899 --> 00:56:40,026
They expect him to bring the milk.

447
00:56:40,194 --> 00:56:42,652
To hell with the milk.

448
00:56:44,406 --> 00:56:48,284
- What must he do to prove himself?
- He proved nothing.

449
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:51,454
He knew if he said a wrong word,
he'd be shot.

450
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:55,292
What were we to do?
Watch him all night, and tomorrow?

451
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,670
When we go do the job, then what?
We take him with us? Tie him up?

452
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:05,258
Or were you planning killing him?
I wouldn't put that past you.

453
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:10,473
- I don't like it.
- All right.

454
00:57:10,641 --> 00:57:13,309
We do the job tonight, as planned.

455
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:37,625
This fuse burns for 10 seconds.
Three seconds for flight of arrow?

456
00:57:37,793 --> 00:57:40,503
- About.
- Once you light the fuse...

457
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:45,425
...you've got seven seconds to shoot.
- Clear.

458
00:57:46,093 --> 00:57:49,885
Start shooting
as soon as the water tower blows.

459
00:57:51,304 --> 00:57:54,765
These are your targets.
That's your position.

460
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:01,021
- I have 4:17.
- 4:20.

461
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:05,445
- 4:24.
- Set them at 4:30.

462
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:13,161
We should have an hour before dawn.
How much time do you need?

463
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:18,415
I'll be ready by 5:00. This fuse
will burn for half-hour exactly.

464
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:22,793
- Fireworks start at 5:30 sharp.
- Any questions?

465
00:58:22,962 --> 00:58:27,883
- Machine gun over the lady's room?
- My job. Anything else?

466
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:33,847
Let's go to work.

467
00:59:15,096 --> 00:59:16,597
Listen to me!

468
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:18,485
- Who are you looking for?
- Raza.

469
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:44,386
There are things that...

470
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:46,848
Captain.

471
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:48,558
What?

472
01:02:58,735 --> 01:03:01,194
Carlos, I won't take long.

473
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:03,406
I know.

474
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:10,494
- How was it?
- Okay.

475
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,764
- Carlos?
- Yeah?

476
01:03:28,932 --> 01:03:32,975
- Want some tequila?
- Oh, good. Thank you, friend.

477
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:08,469
Where are you all going?
I'm right here.

478
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,451
Good night.

479
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,746
- See the woman?
- Yes.

480
01:05:18,913 --> 01:05:20,999
- Talk to her yet?
- No.

481
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:24,669
- How much time we got?
- About eight minutes.

482
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:27,255
- Listen to me!
- Go on.

483
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:29,044
- Go to hell!
- You go to hell!

484
01:05:29,149 --> 01:05:31,216
I don't give a shit!

485
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:45,398
That Chiquita,
she can lick a whole regiment...

486
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,818
...but she can't dance a lick.

487
01:06:44,874 --> 01:06:47,043
You. Go away!

488
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:59,655
Amigo, we've been had.
Let's get the hell out of here.

489
01:08:23,554 --> 01:08:25,848
- No.
- No!

490
01:10:56,122 --> 01:10:59,041
Do exactly as I said.

491
01:11:07,759 --> 01:11:09,426
The Mrs.

492
01:11:09,594 --> 01:11:15,224
Speak only what I told you.
Nothing more, nothing less.

493
01:11:28,947 --> 01:11:31,032
Call them.

494
01:11:34,744 --> 01:11:38,081
Rico. All clear.

495
01:11:39,374 --> 01:11:43,252
By the way, I forgot to bring
your wooden cross...

496
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:47,673
...your upside-down cross.

497
01:11:59,811 --> 01:12:01,187
Cease fire!

498
01:12:01,646 --> 01:12:04,064
Cease fire!
You're going to injure the Mrs.

499
01:12:04,524 --> 01:12:07,484
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!

500
01:12:12,365 --> 01:12:15,325
They're afraid to hit the woman.

501
01:12:15,492 --> 01:12:18,494
Your position is hopeless.

502
01:12:20,122 --> 01:12:21,747
Put down your weapons.

503
01:12:23,501 --> 01:12:24,960
Get up.

504
01:12:26,712 --> 01:12:29,547
Come on, baby. Let's go.

505
01:12:33,386 --> 01:12:35,178
Don't shoot.

506
01:12:49,401 --> 01:12:51,485
Release the woman!

507
01:12:51,653 --> 01:12:53,571
Release her!

508
01:12:58,493 --> 01:12:59,744
Shoot.

509
01:12:59,995 --> 01:13:01,537
Do as I say.

510
01:13:02,122 --> 01:13:03,372
Shoot.

511
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:06,793
One shot from you, I'll kill her.

512
01:13:13,008 --> 01:13:15,426
Get your men off that train.

513
01:13:15,594 --> 01:13:16,637
Move!

514
01:13:18,264 --> 01:13:19,306
Now!

515
01:13:19,849 --> 01:13:21,474
Let's go! Outside.

516
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:36,881
Three against four. What happened?

517
01:17:41,607 --> 01:17:44,359
- Feels like a busted rib.
- You're lucky.

518
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:47,195
The bullet went clean through.

519
01:17:52,076 --> 01:17:54,828
Your hands are filthy.

520
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,045
What's it to you if he lives or dies?

521
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:08,549
If he lives, we'll have to slow down.

522
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:13,095
That'll give Raza
a chance to catch up.

523
01:18:13,263 --> 01:18:16,640
She'll work to keep him alive,
all right.

524
01:18:26,526 --> 01:18:27,569
Yes?

525
01:18:28,903 --> 01:18:30,904
Just wondering.

526
01:18:31,072 --> 01:18:34,032
What makes you worth $100,000?

527
01:18:36,327 --> 01:18:37,786
Go to hell.

528
01:18:38,913 --> 01:18:41,039
Yes, ma'am.

529
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,292
I'm on my way.

530
01:18:58,433 --> 01:18:59,893
Thanks.

531
01:19:04,647 --> 01:19:06,065
How is he?

532
01:19:06,232 --> 01:19:09,693
He will never reach the border.
None of you.

533
01:19:11,738 --> 01:19:15,948
You have no chance. You never did.

534
01:19:16,116 --> 01:19:17,700
We knew everything.

535
01:19:17,868 --> 01:19:21,704
From the moment you set foot
in Mexico. Even before.

536
01:19:21,872 --> 01:19:24,665
From the day
my husband sent for you.

537
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:26,793
Mr. Ortega.

538
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,630
He said he would
give his life for you.

539
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:35,009
For me, not my husband.
For Raza. For the revolution.

540
01:19:36,846 --> 01:19:43,518
From the loyal Ortega to the devoted
goat-keeper, to the faithful wife...

541
01:19:43,685 --> 01:19:49,898
...at the mercy of a brutal kidnapper.
That's one hell of a rigged parlay.

542
01:19:50,067 --> 01:19:51,734
I was not kidnapped.

543
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:54,987
The old badger game.

544
01:19:55,155 --> 01:19:59,408
Shakedown partners, bed partners.

545
01:20:00,661 --> 01:20:01,703
Cosy.

546
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:08,292
Raza and I grew up together.
I am born there.

547
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:14,339
When it's the hacienda of my father,
when Raza is only a stable boy.

548
01:20:14,507 --> 01:20:19,554
We are lovers long before
Mr. Joe Grant buys the place.

549
01:20:20,346 --> 01:20:22,974
When my father lies dying, he says:

550
01:20:23,183 --> 01:20:26,226
"Mr. Joe Grant wants you
for his wife."

551
01:20:26,395 --> 01:20:32,900
"You will become Dona Grant,
a fine lady. That is my wish."

552
01:20:33,067 --> 01:20:36,068
Here, a wish is a command.

553
01:20:37,237 --> 01:20:40,491
But I'm very young and very foolish.

554
01:20:40,658 --> 01:20:44,454
I tell Mr. Joe Grant
I cannot marry to him.

555
01:20:44,621 --> 01:20:47,247
I love another man.

556
01:20:49,834 --> 01:20:52,295
Very romantic, no?

557
01:21:02,597 --> 01:21:04,680
Your husband sent you clothes.

558
01:21:04,848 --> 01:21:07,601
I offer you a better bargain than I got.

559
01:21:07,769 --> 01:21:13,024
Four lives. Yours, if you let me go.

560
01:21:13,192 --> 01:21:16,611
You better change
before we start back.

561
01:21:16,779 --> 01:21:19,655
It'll be a long ride
on your bare bottom.

562
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:34,753
Raza!

563
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:37,964
- How much time have we got?
- None.

564
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:26,929
Get her out. Get her out!

565
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:41,571
Mario!

566
01:24:40,311 --> 01:24:42,188
Drink it.

567
01:24:43,482 --> 01:24:45,275
See anything?

568
01:24:45,443 --> 01:24:46,486
Sand.

569
01:24:48,195 --> 01:24:50,030
They'll be along.

570
01:24:50,197 --> 01:24:54,117
- How would they know which way?
- Raza will know.

571
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:57,327
You should have let me finish him.

572
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:04,543
Why didn't you kill him?

573
01:25:04,711 --> 01:25:07,087
You let Raza live.

574
01:25:07,255 --> 01:25:08,298
Why?

575
01:25:10,008 --> 01:25:11,550
Shall I tell you?

576
01:25:11,718 --> 01:25:16,472
You are simpatico. No man was more
loyal to the revolution than you.

577
01:25:17,266 --> 01:25:19,434
I fought like any other man.

578
01:25:19,602 --> 01:25:24,688
Loyalty such as yours, that comes
only from devotion to a cause.

579
01:25:24,856 --> 01:25:31,403
That same fire burns in Raza. That is
why you could not see him murdered.

580
01:25:31,571 --> 01:25:36,116
He is a thief, trying to steal
100,000 dollars.

581
01:25:36,284 --> 01:25:39,036
You are a whore
cheating on your husband.

582
01:25:39,203 --> 01:25:43,874
My husband stole millions
from this land, our land.

583
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:48,878
If we can keep the revolution alive,
with that money, for just a day...

584
01:25:49,046 --> 01:25:54,134
...then I'll steal and cheat,
and whore...

585
01:25:54,302 --> 01:25:57,846
...and anything else
that must be done.

586
01:26:01,517 --> 01:26:05,812
You laugh. But you believed
in the revolution once.

587
01:26:06,356 --> 01:26:09,358
What else inspired you
to fight for us?

588
01:26:09,525 --> 01:26:11,693
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you.

589
01:26:11,861 --> 01:26:18,282
I got inspired one day
in May, 1911, in El Paso.

590
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:23,663
It started suddenly. Shooting, yelling,
bombs going across the Rio Grande.

591
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:27,918
Everybody ran to see what
the ruckus was about. Me too.

592
01:26:28,086 --> 01:26:31,463
From the top of freight cars
we saw across the river.

593
01:26:31,631 --> 01:26:37,844
The Maderistas were taking Juarez.
The revolution had busted wide open.

594
01:26:38,012 --> 01:26:40,347
It was beautiful.

595
01:26:40,514 --> 01:26:44,432
The next thing I know I was
across the border shooting...

596
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:47,687
...with everybody and yelling,
"Viva Mexico."

597
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:53,651
A month later I was
blowing up trains for Villa.

598
01:26:53,819 --> 01:26:54,861
Yes?

599
01:26:57,406 --> 01:26:58,906
That's it.

600
01:26:59,074 --> 01:27:01,285
Nothing more?

601
01:27:01,911 --> 01:27:04,745
Not even money?

602
01:27:06,249 --> 01:27:08,624
Promised, never paid.

603
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:11,502
But you stayed. You and this one.

604
01:27:11,712 --> 01:27:15,172
And fought for six years,
the worst years.

605
01:27:15,339 --> 01:27:19,969
It's not our war anymore, Mrs. Grant.

606
01:27:20,846 --> 01:27:22,555
Him, I understand.

607
01:27:22,723 --> 01:27:25,808
An adventurer without principles.

608
01:27:25,976 --> 01:27:27,143
But you?

609
01:27:27,311 --> 01:27:29,812
Change your clothes.

610
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,771
We're leaving.

611
01:27:44,911 --> 01:27:48,914
Raza says you
and he were good friends.

612
01:27:49,081 --> 01:27:53,586
- That's right.
- And yet, you would have killed him.

613
01:27:53,754 --> 01:27:55,254
That's right.

614
01:27:55,422 --> 01:27:56,504
For money.

615
01:27:57,633 --> 01:27:59,424
That's right.

616
01:28:18,904 --> 01:28:22,239
For as much money,
would you let me go?

617
01:28:28,663 --> 01:28:34,209
- How long since you had a woman?
- Too long.

618
01:28:34,377 --> 01:28:36,252
You want me?

619
01:28:40,216 --> 01:28:42,634
My price is high.

620
01:28:48,225 --> 01:28:49,517
Freedom.

621
01:28:49,685 --> 01:28:53,895
I might say yes now
and later, no.

622
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:57,816
I trust you.

623
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:31,433
I trust you too.

624
01:29:36,646 --> 01:29:39,858
You heard the man. We're leaving.

625
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:02,773
Finished.

626
01:31:19,164 --> 01:31:23,544
Try a little salt, ma'am.
Make you feel better.

627
01:31:36,389 --> 01:31:38,057
Ma'am...

628
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:42,812
Sorry about your horse, ma'am.

629
01:31:57,243 --> 01:32:00,872
- You know something, Rico?
- Here.

630
01:32:01,831 --> 01:32:04,000
That's a lot of woman there.

631
01:32:04,834 --> 01:32:10,213
Beautiful. Classy. And guts.

632
01:32:10,381 --> 01:32:13,843
Hard enough to kill you,
and soft enough to change you.

633
01:32:14,011 --> 01:32:17,221
Reminds me of another Maria.
Yours.

634
01:32:17,389 --> 01:32:20,558
Amigo, don't con me.

635
01:32:20,726 --> 01:32:24,936
She's going back. If I have
to do it alone, she's going back.

636
01:32:25,104 --> 01:32:27,814
That's what I wanted to hear you say.

637
01:32:27,982 --> 01:32:31,359
What is on your mind besides
100-proof women, 90-proof whisky...

638
01:32:31,527 --> 01:32:34,197
...and 14-carat gold?

639
01:32:34,363 --> 01:32:36,032
Amigo...

640
01:32:37,325 --> 01:32:40,285
...you just wrote my epitaph.

641
01:33:36,843 --> 01:33:40,137
- How many men?
- Raza and six. Pushing hard.

642
01:33:42,931 --> 01:33:44,765
Moving out.

643
01:33:49,271 --> 01:33:52,606
To make the border,
we gotta be out in three hours.

644
01:33:52,774 --> 01:33:56,151
We got an hour, maybe less.

645
01:33:56,319 --> 01:33:58,113
You have lost.

646
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:08,455
Win or lose, here and now.

647
01:34:08,623 --> 01:34:12,126
Bottleneck like this,
one of us might hold them off.

648
01:34:12,294 --> 01:34:14,336
- One of us.
- If he plays it cool.

649
01:34:14,504 --> 01:34:17,339
Hit and run. Stall and retreat.

650
01:34:35,567 --> 01:34:38,611
Ehrengard needs help.
That's Jake's job.

651
01:34:38,778 --> 01:34:41,405
The woman has to be watched.
That's your job.

652
01:34:41,573 --> 01:34:45,784
- Buying the time we need is my job.
- Whoa, amigo. Slow down.

653
01:34:45,952 --> 01:34:51,415
Let's keep this professional. Your job
is to make good our contract.

654
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:54,126
To deliver the goods. All the way.

655
01:34:55,962 --> 01:34:57,921
That's your job.

656
01:35:00,633 --> 01:35:05,470
I got 9000 bucks coming.
In hard cash, please.

657
01:35:05,638 --> 01:35:09,391
Take my horse.
You'll need him if Raza gets past me.

658
01:35:09,934 --> 01:35:10,976
Bill.

659
01:35:13,021 --> 01:35:14,689
See you.

660
01:35:15,814 --> 01:35:16,857
Jake.

661
01:35:20,403 --> 01:35:23,697
How are you going to make it back?

662
01:35:23,865 --> 01:35:26,239
Well, how were you?

663
01:37:32,493 --> 01:37:33,536
No!

664
01:37:36,621 --> 01:37:38,580
Come on! Go on!

665
01:38:05,107 --> 01:38:10,362
Sons of bitches.
Show your faces, bastards.

666
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:38,948
- Fierro!
- I got one of them.

667
01:39:44,664 --> 01:39:46,749
Francisco!

668
01:39:50,544 --> 01:39:52,462
Where are they?

669
01:39:52,631 --> 01:39:56,841
Speak, man. Their positions!

670
01:40:03,934 --> 01:40:04,977
Rico!

671
01:40:07,436 --> 01:40:09,896
Fierro, is he finished?

672
01:40:10,065 --> 01:40:11,564
Not yet, baby.

673
01:40:14,401 --> 01:40:15,443
Baby.

674
01:40:31,919 --> 01:40:33,170
Amigo.

675
01:40:34,797 --> 01:40:38,550
So you are the one
they left to die, huh?

676
01:40:44,347 --> 01:40:47,392
Where did the bullet bite you?

677
01:40:47,559 --> 01:40:49,601
In the ass.

678
01:40:49,769 --> 01:40:50,812
You?

679
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:56,943
Another two inches, mamacita.

680
01:41:07,037 --> 01:41:10,372
Could you spare one more cigarro?

681
01:41:11,624 --> 01:41:13,710
Why, sure.

682
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,169
Come and get it.

683
01:41:16,338 --> 01:41:17,546
Hey, Fierro!

684
01:41:19,632 --> 01:41:24,303
- You want tobacco?
- Smoking is bad for the health.

685
01:41:40,904 --> 01:41:46,116
How do you come
to this dirty business?

686
01:41:46,284 --> 01:41:48,327
The usual.

687
01:41:48,536 --> 01:41:49,787
Money.

688
01:41:50,747 --> 01:41:53,082
Everything is as usual.

689
01:41:53,249 --> 01:41:58,629
I need guns and bullets, as usual.

690
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:04,092
The war goes badly, as usual.

691
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,344
Only you...

692
01:42:06,513 --> 01:42:09,390
...you are not as usual.

693
01:42:12,268 --> 01:42:14,145
Chiquita!

694
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:10,550
How's your love life?

695
01:44:10,718 --> 01:44:12,218
Terrific.

696
01:44:12,845 --> 01:44:14,053
You want some?

697
01:44:15,848 --> 01:44:17,640
Don't you ever say no?

698
01:44:17,809 --> 01:44:19,684
- Never.
- Anybody?

699
01:44:19,852 --> 01:44:21,938
Everybody!

700
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:33,782
You know, of course,
one of us must die.

701
01:44:35,243 --> 01:44:37,493
Maybe both of us.

702
01:44:41,122 --> 01:44:44,042
To die for money is foolish.

703
01:44:44,210 --> 01:44:47,754
To die for a woman is more foolish.

704
01:44:47,922 --> 01:44:50,381
Any woman, even her.

705
01:44:50,549 --> 01:44:52,842
How long you think to hold us here?

706
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:55,428
Oh, a couple of hours.

707
01:44:55,596 --> 01:44:58,599
Then what happens
here won't matter.

708
01:44:59,142 --> 01:45:01,602
She'll be Mrs. Joe Grant again.

709
01:45:06,315 --> 01:45:08,524
But that will change nothing.

710
01:45:08,692 --> 01:45:12,779
She is my woman.
Before. Now. Always.

711
01:45:12,947 --> 01:45:15,323
Nothing is for always.

712
01:45:15,491 --> 01:45:17,909
Except death.

713
01:45:18,077 --> 01:45:20,536
Ask Fierro. Ask Francisco.

714
01:45:20,704 --> 01:45:24,207
Ask those in the
cemetery of nameless men.

715
01:45:24,375 --> 01:45:30,128
- They died for what they believed.
- The revolution?

716
01:45:30,588 --> 01:45:33,465
When the shooting stops
and the dead buried...

717
01:45:33,634 --> 01:45:39,222
...and the politicians take over, it all
adds up to one thing, a lost cause.

718
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:40,433
So...

719
01:45:41,642 --> 01:45:45,728
You want perfection or nothing.

720
01:45:46,939 --> 01:45:49,649
You're too romantic, compadre.

721
01:45:49,817 --> 01:45:53,987
La Revolucion
is like a great love affair.

722
01:45:54,154 --> 01:45:57,155
In the beginning, she is a goddess.

723
01:45:57,323 --> 01:46:03,745
A holy cause. But every
love affair has a terrible enemy.

724
01:46:03,913 --> 01:46:04,955
Time.

725
01:46:06,457 --> 01:46:09,419
We see her as she is.

726
01:46:13,882 --> 01:46:17,593
La Revolucion is not a goddess,
but a whore.

727
01:46:17,761 --> 01:46:21,638
She was never pure,
never saintly, never perfect.

728
01:46:21,805 --> 01:46:25,726
So we run away.
Find another lover, another cause.

729
01:46:25,893 --> 01:46:28,770
Quick, sordid affairs.

730
01:46:28,938 --> 01:46:30,856
Lust, but no love.

731
01:46:31,024 --> 01:46:35,235
Passion, but no compassion.

732
01:46:36,571 --> 01:46:38,864
Without love...

733
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:43,994
...without a cause, we are nothing.

734
01:46:49,708 --> 01:46:52,377
We stay because we believe.

735
01:46:52,545 --> 01:46:55,756
We leave because
we are disillusioned.

736
01:46:55,923 --> 01:46:59,593
We come back because we are lost.

737
01:47:00,511 --> 01:47:03,764
We die because we are committed.

738
01:47:18,904 --> 01:47:21,322
You and I together.

739
01:47:21,491 --> 01:47:22,824
I to the front.

740
01:47:22,992 --> 01:47:25,827
- I will go first.
- Do as I say, woman!

741
01:47:25,995 --> 01:47:28,789
A woman he will not shoot.

742
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:51,561
Jesus!

743
01:48:07,201 --> 01:48:09,704
Hello, baby.

744
01:48:15,543 --> 01:48:20,548
Long time since I hear "baby."

745
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:28,014
Hey, you ever find...

746
01:48:28,182 --> 01:48:31,726
...that damn gold mine?

747
01:48:47,408 --> 01:48:50,202
I am not lucky today.

748
01:48:51,287 --> 01:48:54,373
But you're beautiful.

749
01:48:55,333 --> 01:48:57,960
Querido, baby.

750
01:48:59,462 --> 01:49:04,424
We had some fine times together.

751
01:49:04,634 --> 01:49:05,926
Terrific.

752
01:49:08,888 --> 01:49:11,515
Give us a kiss.

753
01:50:39,061 --> 01:50:42,063
Mrs. Grant, let's go.

754
01:50:42,522 --> 01:50:45,147
As long as we're
not pressed for time.

755
01:50:45,316 --> 01:50:48,151
Well, in a few minutes she'll be home.

756
01:50:50,697 --> 01:50:53,658
Be nice if Bill
was here for the payoff.

757
01:50:54,076 --> 01:50:56,661
Be nice if he was here alive.

758
01:50:56,828 --> 01:50:59,746
But stalling around won't make it so.

759
01:50:59,957 --> 01:51:04,459
A cloud of dust. Could be Mr. Raza.

760
01:51:06,588 --> 01:51:09,340
Could be most anything.

761
01:51:09,756 --> 01:51:11,508
Even a whirling dervish.

762
01:51:19,725 --> 01:51:24,563
That, gentlemen,
is the whirlingest dervish of them all.

763
01:51:28,986 --> 01:51:33,363
- Never thought he'd get out alive.
- And that, gentlemen...

764
01:51:33,532 --> 01:51:36,198
...calls for a celebration.

765
01:52:26,917 --> 01:52:29,585
What's that supposed to mean?

766
01:52:29,753 --> 01:52:34,256
Rico, buddy, this will come
as a shock to both of us.

767
01:52:34,424 --> 01:52:39,763
- I'm a born sucker for love.
- That bullet knocked your brains out.

768
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:41,013
Or let some in.

769
01:52:41,182 --> 01:52:44,433
What happened back there?
What changed your mind?

770
01:52:45,186 --> 01:52:50,981
I found out what makes a woman
worth 100,000 dollars.

771
01:52:51,149 --> 01:52:54,361
You expect me to turn her loose?

772
01:52:54,778 --> 01:52:58,655
Turn her loose? After all we've
been through together?

773
01:52:58,823 --> 01:53:02,659
After all the blood it's cost?
Hell, no!

774
01:53:03,828 --> 01:53:08,582
You made a contract to kidnap
a wife for Mr. J.W. Grant.

775
01:53:11,712 --> 01:53:14,296
Now, let's collect that ransom.

776
01:53:24,473 --> 01:53:27,518
Thank you, from the bottom
of my heart. Thank you.

777
01:53:27,686 --> 01:53:30,145
Nicked you a bit, did they?

778
01:53:30,312 --> 01:53:31,355
Help yourself.

779
01:53:32,691 --> 01:53:35,150
- I'll get Mrs. Grant.
- That isn't necessary.

780
01:53:35,317 --> 01:53:39,362
Hooper! Escort these men
into town. See they're paid in full.

781
01:53:39,531 --> 01:53:45,035
Charge hotel bills, whisky bills,
girl bills, all bills. Anything. On me.

782
01:53:45,203 --> 01:53:48,246
You must be anxious
to get a hot bath...

783
01:53:48,415 --> 01:53:51,666
...so it'll have to be adios
and muchas gracias.

784
01:53:52,543 --> 01:53:55,587
- A hot bath.
- Why? Is it Saturday?

785
01:53:55,755 --> 01:53:59,340
You did your job and earned
a bust-out. Those are orders.

786
01:53:59,842 --> 01:54:02,218
The contract is not complete until...

787
01:54:02,429 --> 01:54:05,263
...Mrs. Grant is delivered
safe and sound.

788
01:54:05,432 --> 01:54:09,267
- The code of the profession?
- Something like that.

789
01:54:09,436 --> 01:54:15,023
Very well. I hereby declare
our contract satisfactorily concluded.

790
01:54:15,191 --> 01:54:18,109
Not yet. Mrs. Grant...

791
01:54:18,277 --> 01:54:20,111
Thank you.

792
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:21,530
Maria!

793
01:54:30,206 --> 01:54:32,957
- Hooper.
- Yes, sir.

794
01:54:34,251 --> 01:54:36,128
Kill him.

795
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:48,473
No, no.

796
01:54:51,894 --> 01:54:54,813
You haven't earned
the right to kill him.

797
01:54:59,401 --> 01:55:02,071
If it's not too much, I want privacy.

798
01:55:02,238 --> 01:55:03,488
- Joseph!
- Not now.

799
01:55:03,697 --> 01:55:06,824
There is nothing to hide.
They know everything.

800
01:55:09,244 --> 01:55:10,577
Everything.

801
01:55:14,833 --> 01:55:17,751
You're back again.
Nothing else matters.

802
01:55:17,919 --> 01:55:20,921
I will run away again. That matters.

803
01:55:21,089 --> 01:55:23,423
You're my wife. You belong to me.

804
01:55:23,591 --> 01:55:24,843
I belong here.

805
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:26,928
- With him?
- With him.

806
01:55:27,096 --> 01:55:30,014
I'd rather see you dead.
You're coming with me!

807
01:55:30,224 --> 01:55:31,432
You're going home!

808
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:33,600
- No!
- Yes!

809
01:55:43,486 --> 01:55:46,613
Gentlemen, you heard our employer.

810
01:55:46,781 --> 01:55:49,241
The lady's going home.

811
01:55:55,951 --> 01:55:59,287
Did you think J.W. Grant was
stupid enough to pay that ransom?

812
01:55:59,455 --> 01:56:00,705
Certainly not.

813
01:56:03,709 --> 01:56:05,585
There was no kidnapping.

814
01:56:05,753 --> 01:56:07,212
Right, Mr. Grant?

815
01:56:12,051 --> 01:56:15,428
- Right, Mr. Grant?
- That is none of your business.

816
01:56:15,596 --> 01:56:17,180
Wrong, Mr. Grant.

817
01:56:17,431 --> 01:56:22,560
We made a contract to save
a lady from a nasty old kidnapper.

818
01:56:22,728 --> 01:56:25,395
Who turns out to be you.

819
01:56:34,406 --> 01:56:36,908
We both made a bad deal, Mr. Grant.

820
01:56:37,076 --> 01:56:42,121
You lose a wife, and we lose
10,000 dollars apiece.

821
01:56:42,998 --> 01:56:45,501
You bastard!

822
01:56:46,752 --> 01:56:50,296
Yes, sir.
In my case, an accident of birth.

823
01:56:50,464 --> 01:56:55,759
But you, sir,
you're a self-made man.
