1
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:15,447
Here, are you starting again?

2
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:18,997
- What if I am?
- What if the police come?

3
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:23,000
Let 'em. The windows
are steamed up, the doors are locked.

4
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:28,286
It's like a Turkish bath.
It don't half make you thirsty.

5
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:31,677
Here! Watch your ring
with my stockings.

6
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,758
Move over a bit, then.

7
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,042
Get your knee off the wheel!

8
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:42,676
- I can't. I'm stuck.
- Look out. I'll do it.

9
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:45,359
That hurt!

10
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:50,642
I told you to be careful
with your legs.

11
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:54,117
- I was only trying to be helpful.
- I can help myself.

12
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,518
Hello.

13
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:01,757
They never make these cars
big enough, do they?

14
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:06,076
Well, you all settled in?
We can begin. My name is...

15
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,635
Alfie?

16
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:10,399
Alfie.

17
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:14,441
I suppose you think you're going
to see the bleeding titles now.

18
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:16,279
Well, you're not, so relax.

19
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:19,439
What time will your old man
be at the station?

20
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:22,246
- Never mind him.
- That's who I will mind.

21
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:25,717
Never spoil a good thing.
You women don't get that.

22
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:29,402
- Enough's as good as a feast.
- You've changed your tune.

23
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:35,198
That horn put me off. I hate noise
at a time Like that. Eh, mate?

24
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:36,959
Don't forget your napkin.

25
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:40,596
The first time you put your hankie
over your shoulder,

26
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:43,155
I thought
you were going to play your fiddle.

27
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:47,525
I come from a musical family.
Here. Mind you don't catch cold.

28
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,204
I've had a lovely time, Alfie.

29
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:59,680
A married woman. Every one of 'em
in need of a good laugh.

30
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,758
It never strikes their husbands.

31
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:05,920
Make a married woman laugh
and you're halfway there with her.

32
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:10,239
It don't work with the single bird.
It'd start you off on the wrong foot.

33
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:13,842
You get one of them laughing,
you won't get nothing else.

34
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:19,002
Just listen to it. It was dead glum
when I met it tonight.

35
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:21,999
I listened to its problems,
then I got it laughing.

36
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,282
It'll go home happy.

37
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:42,357
Where'd you tell
your husband you were?

38
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:44,915
- Pictures with Olive.
- What pictures?

39
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,360
Just the pictures.

40
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:48,881
Never be vague. It plants suspicion.

41
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,765
No wonder there's all this
broken marriage and divorce.

42
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:55,476
It would never occur to him that
another man would wanna take me out.

43
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,205
No, I see what you mean.

44
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:00,324
Suck this sweet
so he don't smell the gin.

45
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:04,923
- I don't care if he does.
- Be human. Why should we hurt him?

46
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,885
- He's done us no harm.
- You want everybody happy.

47
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:11,164
I don't believe in making anybody
unhappy if I don't have to.

48
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:12,646
Or in making an enemy.

49
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:16,606
You could be crossing the Sahara,
and he'd be the bloke you met.

50
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:19,759
What about next week?
Same time, same place?

51
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:22,805
- Maybe.
- I'll go and get my ticket.

52
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:29,442
She don't know
we won't be seeing much more of her.

53
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:31,438
She's on her way out.

54
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:35,645
When a married woman gets too hot on,
it's time to cool off.

55
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,599
Next thing she'll want
is to introduce me to the husband.

56
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:41,917
I can see it coming.

57
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:47,161
- I'll say good night to you, girl.
- The firm's dance is on Saturday.

58
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:50,239
- I'll treat you.
- Won't your old man be there?

59
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,636
Yeah, I'd like you to meet. Night.

60
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:56,080
Don't forget your napkin.

61
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:59,159
I'm like the Boy Scouts,
always prepared.

62
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:04,604
Once I've met the husband,
it don't half put me off the wife.

63
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:08,885
He could be dying, but if I ain't
met him, I won't think about him.

64
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:12,801
It's once you meet. Like as not,
he'll turn out to be a good sport.

65
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:14,400
His sort usually are.

66
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,239
As I'm having it off with her,

67
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:19,399
I keep thinking about him
hanging up his shirts.

68
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,638
Or arguing in the pub
about football or cricket.

69
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:26,083
You get a lot of his sort,
Chelsea supporters.

70
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,964
Hello.

71
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:31,920
- Had a nice time, dear?
- Not bad at all.

72
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:33,201
Good film?

73
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:36,882
There was a queue, so we didn't wait.
We went to a restaurant.

74
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,322
Did you enjoy yourself?
That's the main thing.

75
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:42,205
Well, I did my best. What about you?

76
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:46,644
I went through that garden catalogue
that came. Very interesting.

77
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:52,485
You should go out more. You come back
so cheerful - made over again.

78
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,961
Now I'm off to visit a little bird
called Gilda.

79
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:01,756
While she ain't exactly stupid,
she is a bit on the simple side.

80
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:03,724
She'd never make a number one.

81
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:06,082
You couldn't take her out
and show her off.

82
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:09,637
She ain't an exciting dresser,
but she's a cracking little stand-by.

83
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:13,242
And for another thing,
she ain't a liberty taker.

84
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:18,518
Most birds go mad to get hold of a
bloke and then go about changing him.

85
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:22,043
I told Gilda from the start
that I ain't the marrying sort.

86
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:26,086
Do you know what? She don't mind.
She's a stand-by and she knows it.

87
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:29,796
Any bird that knows its place
in this world can be quite content.

88
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:34,724
Alfie?! Did you forget your key?

89
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:40,643
Humphrey, it's you.

90
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:46,085
Yeah. I'm sorry for coming round
so late, but I was just passing by.

91
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,520
Yes, I see.

92
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,599
I'd just finished work
and I was feeling a bit lonely,

93
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:52,803
so I thought I'd pop in.

94
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:54,878
Yes, I see.

95
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:02,323
Have I come at an awkward time?

96
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,363
I am expecting Alfie any minute.

97
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:38,045
There's a pong in here!

98
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:41,517
It's Phul-Nana. The scent of Araby.
Don't you like it?

99
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,802
No. I like things to smell natural.

100
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,445
I've got your meal ready.

101
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:48,041
Never push things at me
as soon as I come in.

102
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:51,085
Like to get my bearings.
- Just as you like it.

103
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,078
That's enough of that, an' all.

104
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,396
I saw that geezer Humphrey going off.

105
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,237
Here. You're not having it off
with him, are you?

106
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:08,639
Alfie, I can't bear another man
to come near me since I met you.

107
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:12,515
I just wondered. Did he just call
to give you these chocolates, then?

108
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:14,802
No. He called to tell me he loved me.

109
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:18,960
- Love you? Some men are funny.
- Alfie, do you love me?

110
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,921
Well, shall we say I like you a Lot.

111
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:29,239
Ah, well,
I will have that grub after all.

112
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,162
Hot-water bottle?
She's getting a bit previous.

113
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:52,118
Hello.

114
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:59,245
- Is today the 22nd?
- Yeah, I think so.

115
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:01,921
Shouldn't our little friend
have arrived on the 19th?

116
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,999
Don't worry, he'll turn up.
He always has done.

117
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,486
He's usually so punctual.

118
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,001
I had a really good day at the café.

119
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:12,238
I took over £50 on the till.
Isn't that wonderful?

120
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:15,364
What's so wonderful?
It ain't your money.

121
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:18,803
I like to think of them doing well.
It keeps me busy.

122
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:22,800
It's time you started that fiddle,
playing the piano on the till.

123
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:24,240
Alfie, I couldn't.

124
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:27,364
That's the only till in London
that ain't bent.

125
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:30,007
Luigi and his wife
treat me like family.

126
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,726
All the more reason to do 'em.

127
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,367
Alfie, I'm happy as I am.

128
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:39,235
You could still be happy
with a few hundred quid in the bank.

129
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:44,199
Now, look.

130
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:47,838
The one thing you've got to get
into that head of yours

131
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:50,395
is that nobody helps you
in this life.

132
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:54,036
You've got to help yourself.
If you fiddled five bob a day,

133
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,766
you'd have 200 nicker
on one side by now.

134
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,405
Money isn't everything.

135
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:01,240
Only people who ain't got none
say that.

136
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,682
I've had a fiddle
on every job I've done.

137
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:06,327
A fiddle gives you an interest
in your work.

138
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:10,320
I believe that everybody should
take an interest in their work.

139
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,876
There's another little job done.

140
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:30,566
- You sound cheerful, Elkins.
- Some mornings, I feel chirpy.

141
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:33,480
Yeah? Not all that chirpy
on what I'm paying you.

142
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,603
You must be working a nice fiddle.

143
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:38,804
That's defamation of character.
I'll report you.

144
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:41,560
Come off it. How do you think
I got where I am?

145
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:45,037
I'm quite satisfied
as long as you do the job well.

146
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:48,961
But don't get greedy,
otherwise you'll kill the goose.

147
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,920
I tumbled at once.
I shouldn't whistle.

148
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,680
Never be cheerful
if you're doing a fiddle.

149
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,405
You're getting careless.

150
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:05,446
You can say that again.
Little Gilda, she's pregnant.

151
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:08,200
- No! How Long?
- Couple of months.

152
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:10,801
You ain't thinking
of getting married?

153
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,878
Me, in my state of health?

154
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:21,566
Sorry, full up.

155
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,837
Room for just one more inside.

156
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:31,075
Humphrey, I'm glad it's your bus.

157
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,727
- Are you?
- I haven't seen you for so Long.

158
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:37,641
You don't need flinging down stairs
to know you're not welcome.

159
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,843
- I'm sorry.
- That's alright.

160
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:44,197
- I've missed our little chats.
- Have you?

161
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,040
Two six pennies,
when you've got the time!

162
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,598
Ta.

163
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:56,917
I've never seen you looking lovelier.
Still can't get you out of my mind.

164
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,316
How's... How's Alfie these days?

165
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:03,356
He's fine.

166
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,439
Mind you, it doesn't hurt
like it used to.

167
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,882
- What doesn't?
- The old heartache.

168
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,197
Still, I wouldn't be without it.

169
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:17,762
You haven't got engaged
or anything like that, have you?

170
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,241
No, nothing like that.

171
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,841
He doesn't rush into things, Alfie.

172
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:34,837
I don't expect you'll ever need me.

173
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:37,680
But if you do, I'll always be there.

174
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:42,959
Bye, Gilda.

175
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:45,038
God bless.

176
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,356
- Hello, Alfie.
- You're late, girl.

177
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,685
I ran all the way.

178
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,401
Any news? Any reports from the front?

179
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:34,606
No. It doesn't look like it.

180
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:37,804
We've got to do something
about this little Lot.

181
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:39,718
I've tried everything.

182
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:41,877
You're taking stuff on the quiet?

183
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,686
You don't wanna make yourself ill.

184
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,758
Alfie.

185
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,079
- You're getting cooey lately.
- I'm sorry.

186
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,476
And in a way you're more bossified,

187
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:00,957
as if I've got to take notice of you,
instead of you of me.

188
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:03,515
I can't describe it,
but I can feel it.

189
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:06,440
- Do you love me?
- What can I say when you ask?

190
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:10,918
You shouldn't ask, you know.
I'll tell you, when I feel like it.

191
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:15,482
- I'll go and make the coffee.
- Yeah. Make it strong.

192
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:18,238
Alfie, I was thinking.

193
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:21,601
Why can't we... go through with it?

194
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:23,359
What an 'orrible thought!

195
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,915
I've never been through
with anything.

196
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:29,716
If I was to marry you, you'd gain
a husband but lose a friend.

197
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,719
You don't have to marry me.
I've got it worked out.

198
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:37,562
I don't care. Think twice before
you turn an innocent creature out.

199
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:40,878
I wouldn't turn him out.
I'll have him adopted.

200
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,923
What are you talking about?

201
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,760
Well, by a rich woman, see?

202
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:49,362
- A rich woman?
- I'd like to do that much for him.

203
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:51,961
I'd be certain
he'd have a good life, then.

204
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,677
Steady on, girl.

205
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,361
You can't be sure
there's something there yet.

206
00:14:57,447 --> 00:15:00,086
This morning,
I thought I felt him kick.

207
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,603
How can they kick? It won't be
the size of my thumbnail.

208
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:05,962
- I'll tell you next time.
- You won't!

209
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:08,003
Don't give way to your impulses.

210
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,726
Something a woman
might think natural

211
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:12,638
a bloke will find sickening.

212
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:16,845
Mrs Artoni at the café called her
husband every time their baby moved.

213
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:20,397
You don't realise that men
are more sensitive than women.

214
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,718
Remember that big bird
I'd dance with at the Locarno?

215
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:26,844
One Sunday night
she showed me her operation scar,

216
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,681
from when she was a kid.
A long scar with white skin round it.

217
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:33,839
I got straight out of bed
and put my clobber on.

218
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:35,838
"What's up with you?" she says.

219
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:40,000
"I'd sooner see a bleeding
horror film," I said, "than that. "

220
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,518
Alfie, please.

221
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:50,524
Can I, you know,
go through with it and have the baby?

222
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:53,599
What you asking me for?
It's yours, isn't it?

223
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:59,317
Nobody in this world has any right
to stop you doing what you want to.

224
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:06,040
Steady on, girl. Now, then.
Don't break your bleeding heart.

225
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:10,166
If you wanna do something
and you think it's right, you do it.

226
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:12,556
To hell with 'em. Mind my shirt.

227
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:14,638
Now...

228
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:25,484
She was quite happy
them months she was carrying,

229
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,081
which to my mind
was out of place in a way,

230
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,520
her not being married.

231
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:33,282
Mind you, she came over
quite beautified for a time,

232
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,597
especially in the early months.

233
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:40,522
I told her. I says, "Blimey, girl,
you ain't as ugly as I thought. "

234
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:45,078
Anyway, her time comes and into
the hospital she goes to have it.

235
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:48,716
I wasn't there,
so I didn't know till they told me.

236
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,516
Then, from all accounts,
the kid comes out a treat.

237
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:55,599
Right bang on the minute,
you might say.

238
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:03,116
Alfie?

239
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:05,960
I didn't see you there.
You look all different.

240
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,403
- What do you mean?
- Well, sort of mumsy.

241
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:16,764
I put my name down as Mrs Elkins.
Was that alright?

242
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:18,246
Course it's alright.

243
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:22,002
Put your name down as who you like.
It's a free country, isn't it?

244
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:23,805
I brought you some flowers,

245
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:26,481
but I didn't want to be seen
carrying them.

246
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,239
That's nice.

247
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:30,397
Freesias! How delightful.

248
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:33,445
I'll put them into a vase for you,
Mrs Elkins.

249
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:36,200
What do you think
of your son, Mr Elkins?

250
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:39,006
- My what?
- He hasn't seen him yet.

251
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,558
Here he is.

252
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:46,238
He's the image of his father.

253
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:55,318
Yes.

254
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:58,317
I can see more of me in him than you.

255
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,564
What are you gonna call him?

256
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,115
I thought Malcolm Alfred.

257
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:06,198
Malcolm bleeding Alfred?

258
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:09,882
He'll never forgive you
if you give him a name like that!

259
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:13,277
Here, he's moving.
Quick, you better take him.

260
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,206
The mistake I made with Gilda
was getting involved.

261
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:25,565
I was having a beautiful
little life and I couldn't see it.

262
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:29,037
There was this manageress
of a dry-cleaner's.

263
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,915
And I was getting
a suit cleaned in the bargain.

264
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,079
well, you can't turn
something like that down.

265
00:18:57,647 --> 00:18:59,956
Then, there was a chiropodist
from a foot-comfort service

266
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:03,437
I was having it off with.
She cut my corns handsome.

267
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:06,246
I never had my feet
in such lovely condition.

268
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:08,716
I was hopping about
Like a little fairy.

269
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:12,801
She's got a little ginger moustache,

270
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:17,039
but I find I'm quite willing to
overlook the odd blemish in a woman,

271
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:20,517
provided she's got something else
to make up for it.

272
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:27,403
Well, that's why we're here - to
help one another out in this life.

273
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,958
Then there was Dora,
a little bird from Pimlico

274
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,959
I had it off with
Mondays and Wednesdays

275
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:38,164
when her young man
was at his body-building classes.

276
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:42,686
And, on top of them,

277
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,555
there was always the odd bird
that came my way by chance.

278
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:53,007
What a lovely baby.

279
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:56,477
- Is it yours?
- No, no, it's my sister's.

280
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:01,283
So why I had to get involved
with Gilda, I do not know.

281
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:05,440
- What's that brown round his mouth?
- A bar of chocolate I gave him.

282
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:07,597
Alfie, you shouldn't!

283
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,005
You smell a bit milkified.

284
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:14,121
I'm sorry, Alfie, I'll have a wash.

285
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,596
No, I don't mind, it smells mumsy.

286
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:20,405
How long will you do
the breast-feeding caper?

287
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:23,479
As long as I can.
It's the best thing for him.

288
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:26,684
Don't let yourself
get too attached to him.

289
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,280
Why not? I'm his mother.

290
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,881
And I'm his father,
but you've gotta be fair.

291
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:32,798
You've gotta think of him.

292
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:36,482
- What about this rich woman?
- What rich woman?

293
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:40,116
The one who was gonna adopt him,
so he'd have a chance in life.

294
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:42,846
I've got to think about it.
I can't rush into it.

295
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:45,999
- Make up your mind quick.
- Why should I?

296
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:48,078
He might get so drawn to you,

297
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:51,284
It'll fret his heart out
when they take him away.

298
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:54,677
- Who says they'll take him away?
- That's what you said.

299
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:58,077
You were gonna get him adopted
so he'd want for nothing.

300
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,158
That was a long time ago.

301
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:04,115
You know what you've had,
don't you, girl?

302
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:07,802
You've had a change of heart.
I can see it in your face.

303
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:10,526
What about it?
Haven't you ever had one?

304
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:12,723
Yes, but I've always resisted it.

305
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:15,605
Lying in hospital feeding him
brought it on.

306
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:19,123
I could see your face changing.
Coming over all mumsy.

307
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:22,517
- I'm not ashamed of it.
- But you've got to think of him.

308
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:26,725
You could never bring him up
like this rich woman could.

309
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:29,640
We'll see.
I'm going back to work next week.

310
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:33,322
She could really take care of him.
Dress him handsome.

311
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,923
Who says I can't dress him proper?

312
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,362
Look at that lovely shawl,

313
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:43,086
and the things for him
in that drawer.

314
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,762
You can't learn him to talk nice.
Not Like this rich woman could.

315
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,166
I can if I try hard.

316
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:52,684
Not proper, you can't. he'll be
"bleeding" this and that and worse.

317
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:55,759
- I won't let him.
- These are dry, you can use 'em.

318
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,805
Who'll look after him
when you go back to the caff?

319
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:02,562
I'm not going back. I'll work in
the brewery. It's better paid.

320
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:06,845
Lugging bleeding beer crates about?
When will you learn some sense?

321
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,919
Who will look after him
while you're at the brewery?

322
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:11,645
A woman called Mrs Tippet.

323
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:15,242
She's got four children of her own
and she'll look after him

324
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:17,602
from Monday morning
till Friday teatime.

325
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:21,805
And I'll have him all the weekend.
I think that's best for him.

326
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,401
And what about... and what about me?

327
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:28,036
You think I'll spend my weekends
dodging under wet nappies?

328
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:30,766
You won't leave us, Alfie? Not now?

329
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:32,678
I'll have to think about it.

330
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:36,442
Please! I won't ever ask you
for anything, not a farthing.

331
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:39,564
But don't leave us now.
If you do...

332
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:43,162
Don't talk like that.
I haven't said I'll leave you.

333
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:46,842
I had to speak up. I don't think
you're doing right by that kid.

334
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:51,398
But I will. I'll look after him.
I'll never neglect him. Never.

335
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:54,399
I'm only telling you the truth
as I see it.

336
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:56,478
You won't Leave us, will you?

337
00:22:56,567 --> 00:23:00,958
- Promise me, Alfie. Promise!
- Let go. Don't ruckle my sleeve.

338
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:04,802
I ain't a savage.
I ain't gonna scarper.

339
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:06,559
But don't start crying, either.

340
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:08,842
I'll belt you one for sure.

341
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:10,883
I don't feel up to it.

342
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:14,879
Don't jump up to him at once.
It don't do.

343
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:19,324
You'll grow more attached to each
other, and he won't go to Mrs Tippet.

344
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:23,002
Here, mate. That's enough of that.

345
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:26,397
I'll give you something to cry for.
Come on now.

346
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:38,199
There you are.
All you need is a father's voice.

347
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:40,596
He's got a hard life in front of him.

348
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:44,202
Don't give him any wrong impression
from the start.

349
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:13,882
<i>Now, about this little kid of mine.</i>

350
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:15,958
<i>He turns out
to be a real quick 'un.</i>

351
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:19,483
<i>And he don't half love it
when I play games with him.</i>

352
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:23,401
<i>Never wants his mother,
always asking for his father.</i>

353
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:27,958
<i>Very soon, I find I'm getting quite
attached to him. Know what I mean?</i>

354
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:30,845
<i>That's something
I always guard against.</i>

355
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,886
<i>Because sooner or later
that's gonna bring you some pain.</i>

356
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:38,044
<i>So if a bird ain't got you one way,
she's got you another.</i>

357
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:46,161
That's the trouble.

358
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:49,205
Once you get a kid in your life,
it ain't your own.

359
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,677
- Look at the things you have to do.
- Next, please.

360
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:59,721
well, you can't be too careful,
not with hereditary.

361
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:02,518
No smoking, please.

362
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:09,162
Queer job for a bird,
photographing people's insides.

363
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,158
Chin on the top, please.

364
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:19,277
Hands on hips. Shoulders forward.

365
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:23,164
What's she think I am,
a bleeding contortionist?

366
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:26,876
Nice hands, though.
Firm but gentle. Know what I mean?

367
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:30,403
- I wouldn't mind her giving me a...
- Hold it.

368
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,957
Next, They'll be taking pictures
of what you're thinking.

369
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:36,038
There'll be some X certificates
knocking around.

370
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:52,085
Sorry I'm Late. There was
a traffic jam at Piccadilly.

371
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,123
It's alright, you're here now.

372
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:56,198
I brought you some cherries.

373
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,676
You shouldn't have done.

374
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:04,515
Well, we never got that rain
they promised us.

375
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:06,404
Doesn't look Like it.

376
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,405
You had a hard morning?

377
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,758
The usual.

378
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:24,525
I don't like you working on that
brewery bay. It's no job for a woman.

379
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:26,598
You get used to it.

380
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,206
- What's that?
- That ring I was talking about.

381
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:39,124
- It's heavy!
- 22 carat. Solid gold.

382
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:41,675
Same as I say that was my mother's.

383
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,802
They don't make rings
like that today.

384
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,843
They made 'em to last then.

385
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:50,397
- Can I try it on?
- Yeah, go on.

386
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:54,401
Er, no. No, sorry, but it's bad luck.

387
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:58,082
Once you put a wedding ring on,
you should never take it off.

388
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:01,682
That's what they say. I don't know
if there's anything in it.

389
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:06,118
Humphrey?

390
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:14,045
How would you feel...
bringing up another man's child?

391
00:27:20,127 --> 00:27:21,685
Have a cherry?

392
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:26,800
You mean little Malcolm?
well, I mean...

393
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:30,926
Once we were married, I could only
look on him as my own child.

394
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:34,886
I'd try to be a good father to him,
if he'd have me.

395
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:41,476
Here. Look, can I have this?

396
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:47,718
Come on, darling, have a little bit
of the lady's sandwich.

397
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:49,684
Just a little bit.

398
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:53,805
Come on, darling. I won't hurt you.

399
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:56,961
Just a little bit. Come on. Good boy.

400
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:01,676
I must go. I shall be late for work.

401
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,406
Will you think over
what I said Last Wednesday?

402
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,962
I've been thinking it over.

403
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:14,358
I'LL tell it to you
for the last time, Malcolm.

404
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:16,756
Then you've gotta go to bye-byes.

405
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:20,601
"Abou Ben Adhem,
may his tribe increase,

406
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:24,919
awoke one night
from a dream of peace. "

407
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,885
"And saw within the moonlight
in his room,

408
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:31,645
making it rich
and like a lily in bloom,

409
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,881
an angel writing
in a book of gold... "

410
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:36,525
What's a angel?

411
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:38,996
You know what an angel is.
I told you.

412
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:41,885
They're on guard, up in heaven,
all round God.

413
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:46,079
"Exceeding peace
had made Ben Adhem bold... "

414
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,681
Who's Ben Adhem?

415
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:50,962
He's the man it's all happening to.

416
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:54,119
Now,
shut your eyes and listen, Malcolm.

417
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:57,802
Lie down, and don't ask questions.

418
00:28:59,247 --> 00:29:02,444
"And to the presence
in the room he said,

419
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:04,836
'What writest thou?'"

420
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:08,236
"The vision raised its head,

421
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:11,763
and, with a look
made of all sweet accord,

422
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:18,164
answered, 'The names of those
who love the Lord. '"

423
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:39,436
What a lad. He could hardly keep his
eyes open, but he wouldn't give in.

424
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,405
Know what?
He went off just like that.

425
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:47,198
he'll be a real handful
in a few months' time.

426
00:29:48,447 --> 00:29:51,166
We'll have to be careful
what we say in front of him.

427
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,078
He's as sharp as a needle.

428
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,477
Wait till he sees that teddy bear
I bought for his birthday.

429
00:29:57,567 --> 00:30:00,161
It's about that size. Ever so soft.

430
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:05,159
The bloke who sold it to me
said it was a real rich kid's teddy.

431
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:11,363
Here, do you fancy an hour's kip,
girl, while he's asleep?

432
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:15,163
Cloth ears! I'm talking to you.

433
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:19,124
Humphrey's been to see me
twice this week at lunch time.

434
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:21,243
What's he after? A bit on the side?

435
00:30:21,327 --> 00:30:24,683
Nothing like that.
We just talked a bit.

436
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:32,039
Don't tell me what you talked about,
because I don't want to know!

437
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:34,083
One thing I can't bear to hear about

438
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:37,682
is a bird and a bloke
having innocent talks together.

439
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:40,600
I think it's more intimate
than the other.

440
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:43,915
What is he after?

441
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:45,998
He wants to marry me.

442
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:51,285
- What did you tell him?
- That I'd talk it over with you.

443
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:54,279
Why talk it over with me?
You're a free agent.

444
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:57,245
- Malcolm needs a father.
- What do you think I am?

445
00:30:57,327 --> 00:31:00,922
I don't mean just a weekend father,
I mean a proper father.

446
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,601
Yeah, well,
we all need proper fathers.

447
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,996
And proper mothers, too,
come to that.

448
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:09,762
It seems there's just not enough
to go around these days.

449
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,644
I don't love him.

450
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:15,436
I don't know what love is,
the way you birds talk about it.

451
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:17,916
But I respect him.

452
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:25,362
Well, you'd better marry him, then,
hadn't you?

453
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,078
You've got young buster in there
to think about.

454
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:32,158
I'll be seeing you.

455
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:34,926
Maybe.

456
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:42,638
Daddy!

457
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:48,646
Daddy!

458
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:18,356
Nice, isn't it?
Goes like a bomb, too.

459
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:22,486
This car-hire firm I'm working for,
they have all the best stuff.

460
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,159
Know where I'm off to now?

461
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:27,762
Pick up a party of publicans,
take 'em to Brighton for the races.

462
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:30,042
You've gotta get out
and enjoy yourself.

463
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:33,756
Once a bloke starts thinking about
a bird he's finished with,

464
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:36,600
well, there's a waste of time
for you.

465
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:43,282
I'm not picking 'em up till 11:30,
so I'm popping in here.

466
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:46,598
It's that X-ray.
Didn't come out right or something.

467
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:49,201
Load of red tape, if you ask me.

468
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:18,641
Tilt forward, please. Thank you.

469
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:24,761
You've done this before, haven't you?

470
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:28,635
Thank you. Have you been worrying
about anything lately, Mr Elkins?

471
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:31,480
Who, me?
No, I'm not the worrying sort.

472
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:37,961
You know what? Gilda's only decided
to marry this Humphrey geezer.

473
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:42,404
- Do you find you get tired easily?
- No, I'm always full of energy.

474
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,284
I got a letter from her, see?

475
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:47,564
"I don't love him," she says,
"but I do respect him. "

476
00:33:47,647 --> 00:33:51,401
I don't want no bird's respect.
I wouldn't know what to do with it.

477
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:55,915
- Step on the scales, please.
- I haven't got much time.

478
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:58,761
She's told me time and again
she loves me.

479
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:01,441
Loves me for myself,
whatever that means.

480
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:05,122
- Have you lost any weight?
- No, I always weigh 12 stone six.

481
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:08,916
Have done for years.
But I've never told her I love her.

482
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:12,795
Except when you've gotta
say something for appearances' sake.

483
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:16,197
- 11 stone nine pounds.
- Get out of it!

484
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,757
You sure these scales are right?
This suit don't weigh nothing.

485
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:23,760
Nine ounces, lightweight.
It's the new Terylene and mohair.

486
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:27,839
You don't feel as though
you've got nothing on at all.

487
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:31,161
The one thing I never do
with a woman, I never...

488
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:34,000
Would you take your shirt off,
please?

489
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:38,200
Would you take your shirt off,
please?

490
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:43,205
I never crawl to one. They either
take me as I am or not at all.

491
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:47,798
Do you perspire?
I mean, do you sweat much?

492
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:49,605
Sweat? No.

493
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:53,600
Tell a lie, I did sweat
last Sunday at the Locarno.

494
00:34:53,687 --> 00:34:56,247
But I was dancing,
and I'd had a few beers.

495
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,795
I use a deodorant under my armpits.

496
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:01,642
Just rub it on. Quite good, they are.

497
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:05,083
I see. Do you ever sweat at night?

498
00:35:07,447 --> 00:35:09,517
At night?

499
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:13,963
- You mean in bed?
- Yes, in bed.

500
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:17,880
Come to think of it,
I did sweat a lot Last night.

501
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,686
I couldn't for the life of me
understand why.

502
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:23,440
Sit there with your back to me,
please.

503
00:35:27,687 --> 00:35:29,325
Now take a deep breath.

504
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,645
Now breathe out slowly.

505
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:36,402
She said, "Malcolm will be alright.
I'LL be home to Look after him. "

506
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:38,478
Again. A good deep one.

507
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:41,118
Hold it.

508
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,556
Let it out.

509
00:35:52,647 --> 00:35:55,605
"What about you?" she said.
"Won't you miss us?"

510
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,518
- Say 99.
- 99.

511
00:35:57,607 --> 00:36:01,646
- I came over quite choked at that.
- Again. Whisper it this time.

512
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,843
- 99.
- Whisper it again.

513
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:06,760
99. Course I managed before...

514
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:09,645
I managed before I met her
and I'll manage now she's gone.

515
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:12,195
- Do you ever feel any back pain?
- Pain? No.

516
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:16,405
You know what? Last week,
I find I'm missing her, so I calls...

517
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:18,603
Funny,
I do feel some pain there now.

518
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:20,962
- Where? There?
- No, a bit to the left.

519
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:23,038
- There?
- No, higher up.

520
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:24,719
- There?
- Yeah, there.

521
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:28,083
- Is it tender?
- It is when you mess it about.

522
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,646
Turn around, please.

523
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:32,197
Yeah, so I calls round, you see.

524
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:35,399
She wouldn't let me in.
She kept me at the door.

525
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,603
Take a deep breath.

526
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:41,282
But little Malcolm kept yelling
"Daddy!" so she had to let me in.

527
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,766
Breathe out.

528
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:46,601
She wouldn't let me touch her.
She drew back for the first time.

529
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:47,756
- 99.
- 100.

530
00:36:47,847 --> 00:36:49,678
- What?
- 99.

531
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:53,316
Yeah, she drew back. "Sorry,
but I'm playing fair by Humphrey,

532
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:55,204
the way
I've always played fair by you. "

533
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:57,403
- Do you cough much?
- Cough? No.

534
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:01,480
Only in the mornings, but everyone
does after the first smoke.

535
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:05,162
Fair by me? She never wanted
no other geezer when she was with me.

536
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:07,841
What playing fair was that?
Bleeding sauce!

537
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:11,715
- Bring anything up when you cough?
- No. I just clear my chest.

538
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:15,846
That's the point of coughing.
Bring something up, clear the tubes.

539
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:19,317
Now, the pair of 'em have taken
my little son from me.

540
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:23,798
There are times when I can still
hear him calling "Daddy!" after me.

541
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:26,685
Do you find
you get quickly irritable of late?

542
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:31,439
Funny you should ask. I do find
I do my nut very easily these days.

543
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:33,722
- Do you sleep well?
- Like a top.

544
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:37,595
The moment my head hits the pillow,
I'm off. I never wake up till...

545
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:38,836
Till when, Mr Elkins?

546
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:41,885
I never used to wake up
till it was time to get up.

547
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:45,676
That's Elkins with an S.
You know what I mean?

548
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:49,680
- I think so. And now?
- I wake up dead on the same time.

549
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,485
Four o'clock in the morning.

550
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:54,957
That is, no matter
how much I've had to drink or...

551
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:58,437
- Can I be perfectly frank with you?
- Certainly.

552
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:09,444
No matter who's beside me.
You know what I mean?

553
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:10,926
Yes, I understand.

554
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:14,602
Thank you. I never have been partial
to these all-night sessions.

555
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:17,759
For one thing,
I've rarely found a woman...

556
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,835
You don't mind
if I come out with it straight?

557
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:22,997
You can tell me everything.

558
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:27,164
Very few birds can get into my rhythm
of sleeping.

559
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:29,206
I see.

560
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:33,041
I find myself lying there in the dark
staring at the ceiling.

561
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:35,641
I keep thinking
about this kid I used to know.

562
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:37,524
I was friendly with his mother.

563
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,121
Nothing special,
just an ordinary girl.

564
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:42,084
But I knew him well, the child.

565
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,362
There's something I must tell you.

566
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,644
AII I wanted was for her
to come back with little Malcolm,

567
00:38:47,727 --> 00:38:50,560
so we could spend
our Sundays together.

568
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:53,764
But she never come.
Do you understand me?

569
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:55,724
- Yes, perfectly.
- Now.

570
00:38:55,807 --> 00:38:58,844
If you lose a bird,
you can always replace her.

571
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:01,202
But with a child, it's different.

572
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:05,439
They're each one themselves.
Each one's got his different nature.

573
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:07,961
I may not be the best dad
in the world,

574
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:11,084
but I am his real dad.
Credit where credit's due.

575
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:13,397
There's something I must tell you.

576
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:17,765
He's come out of these loins.
What do you wanna tell me?

577
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:19,200
Look at this.

578
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:21,926
They can't get away from it.
He's my son.

579
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:23,998
This is your X-ray, Mr Elkins.

580
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:28,238
- Blimey! Is that me?
- Yes, it is.

581
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:29,999
I'm just a load of old ribs!

582
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:32,521
I'm afraid there are two shadows
on your lungs.

583
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:35,326
Shadows on my lungs?
What are you talking about?

584
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:39,366
Look at this patch. You've got
an infection here. And one here.

585
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:42,325
An infection? I can't have!
I ain't been with nobody!

586
00:39:42,407 --> 00:39:45,763
- It's not a question...
- You have to do something about it.

587
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:47,246
We can deal with it.

588
00:39:47,327 --> 00:39:50,637
I want the best attention there is.
I'll even pay for it.

589
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:53,844
It's just a question of rest.
That's all you need.

590
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:57,237
I can't rest. I'm off to Brighton
with licentious victuallers!

591
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,477
We're in for a blow-out. It's booked!

592
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:02,604
It has to be unbooked.
You need rest in the country.

593
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:07,203
I hate the country. How can you rest
with all that bleeding dawn chorus?

594
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,726
What's the matter?

595
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,516
My feet feel like lead.

596
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,885
The sweat's pouring off me!

597
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:28,596
Mr Elkins, do keep calm.
These are only shadows.

598
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,678
Shadows?

599
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:33,718
On my lungs?

600
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:35,886
I'm being eaten away!

601
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,678
This is the end of me!

602
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,758
God in heaven, help me!

603
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:53,404
Good afternoon, Mr Elkins.

604
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:55,478
Good afternoon.

605
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:59,319
Here, once you know
you ain't gonna die,

606
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:02,160
funny how soon
you pull back to normal.

607
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:11,603
I used to think
money was everything.

608
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:15,157
If you've got money, I used to say,
you can have beautiful birds,

609
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:17,203
handsome suits, a car of your own.

610
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:20,757
But those things ain't a bit of use
without good health.

611
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:24,725
Hello, Harry. Not come yet?

612
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:26,957
She's run off with the milkman.

613
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:31,526
Here, see this chap here?

614
00:41:31,607 --> 00:41:33,757
His name's Harry Clamacraft.

615
00:41:33,847 --> 00:41:37,681
He's 35 years old,
married, with three kids.

616
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:41,237
He's sitting in bed
waiting for his wife, Lily, to visit.

617
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:43,887
He's had nothing else on his mind
since Sunday.

618
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:45,844
I know for sure she'll be late.

619
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:48,885
Watch him. In a minute,
he'll pick up that book

620
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:52,277
and pretend he's not worried
and he's reading.

621
00:41:53,287 --> 00:41:55,357
There you are, what did I tell you?

622
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:57,517
He's no more reading than I am.

623
00:41:57,607 --> 00:42:00,405
He's all ears,
listening for her footsteps.

624
00:42:01,007 --> 00:42:05,080
You know what? I ain't had a single
visitor since I've been in here.

625
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:08,682
I told 'em all I'm on silence,
not allowed to talk.

626
00:42:14,527 --> 00:42:16,836
Oi, Harry, your old woman's here.

627
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:21,760
Mrs Clamacraft? Don't go all
the way round. Come through here.

628
00:42:21,847 --> 00:42:25,635
- I'm not supposed to.
- Course you can. Come on.

629
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:29,485
- Here she is, Harry.
- Hello, Love.

630
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:33,446
- Harry, I'm sorry I'm late.
- That's alright. Now you've come.

631
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:38,963
She's 20 minutes late and now she
wastes another 20 telling him why.

632
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:42,799
I left home in time, but everything
went wrong at the station.

633
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:44,286
You look worried.

634
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:47,757
I was only worried in case
something had happened to you.

635
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,158
Here's your new-laid eggs.

636
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:55,646
Here's your marmalade.

637
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:58,878
Bleeding great chunks of peel in it.
No wonder he's ill.

638
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:01,845
Did that chap come about the smell
in the garden?

639
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:04,566
He thinks it's trouble
with the main drain.

640
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:07,844
Now he's worried
about the bleeding drains.

641
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:11,317
- How were your last X-rays?
- I think they're improving.

642
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:15,286
Ask him to look at that loose gutter.
It might fall on you or the kids.

643
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:18,040
- Kill the bleeding lot of 'em.
- I will.

644
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:22,483
- How was your sputum test?
- Now there's a morale raiser!

645
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,876
They're waiting for the results.

646
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:27,959
Are you managing alright?
I mean, about money?

647
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:30,607
Yes, everything's going fine.

648
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,723
- You're sure?
- Yes, certain.

649
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:35,241
They're trying to get through
to one another. Know what I mean?

650
00:43:35,327 --> 00:43:37,158
It ain't easy
with their sort of mentality.

651
00:43:39,727 --> 00:43:41,638
Here, see this?

652
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:45,800
Carla, her name is.
Hear how her skirt rustles?

653
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:49,360
There's something
about that rustling.

654
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:52,120
I think I'll get on my bed,
just in case.

655
00:43:56,527 --> 00:43:59,599
Don't let me disturb you.
You can take that later.

656
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:03,919
I know what it must be like,
seeing each other only once a week.

657
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:09,884
- She seems quite nice.
- Yeah, she's very nice.

658
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:13,280
I'll just get you ready
for your injection, Mr Elkins.

659
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,358
Thank you, nurse.

660
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,476
would you like a banana?

661
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,558
Thanks.

662
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,804
Ta.

663
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:46,922
Did my mother come round?

664
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:49,521
What?! Yes.

665
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:51,006
Was everything alright?

666
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:54,477
She was put out because I
hadn't made the kids a cooked dinner.

667
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,876
She's mad about Sunday dinners.

668
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:11,756
- Young Phil's missing you ever so.
- Is he?

669
00:45:11,847 --> 00:45:14,077
He woke up early this morning.

670
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:17,477
I could hear him talking away
to himself in his cot.

671
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:20,240
He kept scolding you
for not coming home.

672
00:45:20,327 --> 00:45:22,079
Ah, bless him!

673
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:26,003
- I seem to have only just got here.
- Don't panic.

674
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:30,239
Dirty beast!

675
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:33,125
The sister will give you
your injection after tea.

676
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:36,040
Tell her to send the blonde
who's a good dart thrower.

677
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:40,120
- You won't forget to write?
- As soon as they've gone to school.

678
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:43,199
- Give my love to Phil and Shirley.
- I will.

679
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,084
- Bye, Love.
- Eat your eggs.

680
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:47,681
Yeah, I will.

681
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:49,917
Don't worry,
I'll be alright in a minute.

682
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:51,998
Don't worry, I'll look after him.

683
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:55,239
- He hates me going.
- I'll soon cheer him up.

684
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,318
Thank you.

685
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:08,803
You get dependent on 'em coming, see.

686
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:12,516
And it don't do to get dependent
on nobody in this life.

687
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:16,202
They bring fruit and flowers
and say how well you Look,

688
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:21,122
and after five minutes, they're dying
for the bell so they can get away.

689
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:23,926
I know, I've watched 'em.

690
00:46:24,007 --> 00:46:26,919
They're no sooner out of the
door than they say to each other,

691
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:30,124
"Gawd, did you see old Ned?
Didn't he Look rough?"

692
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:35,281
"Keep them insurance policies dusted.
Don't throw that black hat away. "

693
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,358
I've heard 'em.

694
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:50,647
- Mr Elkins.
- Hello, nurse.

695
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:52,445
You should be in bed.

696
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:55,644
I couldn't sleep, so I come down
and made a cup of tea.

697
00:46:55,727 --> 00:46:57,718
You're not supposed to.

698
00:46:57,807 --> 00:47:01,117
I have been doing things all my life
I'm not supposed to.

699
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:04,206
You know what?
I had an 'orrible nightmare.

700
00:47:04,807 --> 00:47:07,605
- You must have had too much supper.
- No, serious.

701
00:47:07,687 --> 00:47:10,918
I dreamt
that the hydrogen bomb had fallen,

702
00:47:11,007 --> 00:47:12,725
and I didn't get killed.

703
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:16,277
But I got some of that dust
on my shoulder, see?

704
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:18,801
I rushes in this house,
shuts the door,

705
00:47:18,887 --> 00:47:21,276
and who's standing there?
little Malcolm.

706
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:23,483
Who?

707
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:26,525
Oh, yeah.
It's this kid I used to know.

708
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:31,678
And then I realised that this...
this dust on me,

709
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,917
this poison I've picked up,...

710
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:38,442
.. will kill him.
And I was taking it to him.

711
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:40,916
I was taking death to him.

712
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:45,159
But what could I do? I had to save
my bleeding self, didn't I?

713
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,517
Made me feel rough, though.

714
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:51,326
It would make some sense
to a psychiatrist.

715
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:53,398
You know what? I wish just for once

716
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:56,524
I could get myself to do
something good in my dreams.

717
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,723
It wouldn't cost me anything.

718
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:01,879
I'd get a great deal
of satisfaction out of it.

719
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:05,721
They've got you when you're awake
and when you're asleep.

720
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:07,684
you'll be leaving here next month?

721
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:10,565
Yeah.
I'll be glad to get back to London.

722
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:13,923
It won't be the same
without you around here.

723
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:16,080
I ain't gone yet.

724
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:21,484
would you like me to give you
something to make you sleep?

725
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:23,683
Now, there's a good idea.

726
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,758
Alright, then, come with me.

727
00:48:27,567 --> 00:48:30,718
Marvellous what you can get
on the National Health.

728
00:48:34,087 --> 00:48:36,123
- Bye, Mr Elkins.
- Bye, Mrs Clamacraft.

729
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:38,198
Bye-bye, Love.

730
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:49,004
You know something? Visiting days
ain't doing you any good.

731
00:48:49,087 --> 00:48:52,238
- How do you mean?
- Takes you a week to get over one.

732
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:56,206
If you're not careful, you'll be
leaving here in your wooden suit.

733
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:59,563
But that's all I live for,
to see her and Talk to her.

734
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,445
You've got to live for yourself,
not for others.

735
00:49:02,527 --> 00:49:04,757
You'd do without her
if she got run over.

736
00:49:04,847 --> 00:49:06,758
Don't talk like that, Alfie.

737
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:08,838
No. All I'm saying is,

738
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:12,715
it don't do to get attached
to nobody like that in this life.

739
00:49:12,807 --> 00:49:16,038
What your sort don't understand...

740
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:18,595
- What?
- Is...

741
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:20,723
Is the bond between husband and wife.

742
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:23,958
What I do understand
is human bleeding nature.

743
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:27,323
How do you know your missus
ain't got a geezer outside?

744
00:49:27,407 --> 00:49:30,285
You say another word about my wife,
I'll knock your bloody...!

745
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,005
Harry.

746
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:33,839
Don't get aeriated.

747
00:49:35,527 --> 00:49:37,518
Harry, sit quiet.

748
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:41,885
Here, have a fag.

749
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:44,686
The doc said not to smoke
more than five a day.

750
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:48,476
Take no notice of the doc.
You've got to get yourself better.

751
00:49:48,567 --> 00:49:49,886
No, all I meant was,

752
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:54,040
with a bird, you can never tell
where it's been nor what it's done.

753
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:56,641
Say "she. "
You're talking about my wife.

754
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,763
She or it, they're all birds.

755
00:49:59,647 --> 00:50:02,844
What you've got to do
is start living for yourself.

756
00:50:02,927 --> 00:50:05,043
Like I do.

757
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,118
They won't keep me here long.

758
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:09,922
No, but, Alfie, I miss the kids.

759
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,522
- Especially the youngest.
- Here, just listen to me.

760
00:50:13,607 --> 00:50:15,837
Just listen to me for a minute.

761
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:20,079
Supposing tonight, you was
to snuff it. Know what I mean?

762
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:22,681
- You're a right 'un.
- Just supposing.

763
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:25,998
- Have a giggle. That's all life is.

764
00:50:26,087 --> 00:50:29,841
Say your old woman picks up
with a bloke and brings him home.

765
00:50:29,927 --> 00:50:31,440
Not Lily! She wouldn't.

766
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:34,724
Why not? She ain't bad.
She's got a fair little figure.

767
00:50:34,807 --> 00:50:37,844
Not my type, but still.
She brings this bloke home

768
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:40,521
and introduces him to the kids
as Uncle Bill.

769
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:43,917
- Your kids'd get a kick out of him.
- Not young Phil.

770
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,567
He'd be the first
if Uncle Bill brought some toys.

771
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:48,683
You wouldn't buy Phil with toys!

772
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:52,362
Then your missus tells
the neighbours the kids need a dad.

773
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:55,405
- She'd blame it on the kids.
- What are you getting at?

774
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:58,684
I only want you to see the truth
and start getting better.

775
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:00,962
For a month or two after you're gone,

776
00:51:01,047 --> 00:51:04,244
your wife and kids
might take flowers to the cemetery,

777
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:08,923
but once she's married again and the
kids start calling Uncle Bill "Dad",

778
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:12,522
your little grave
will become just a mass of weeds.

779
00:51:12,607 --> 00:51:15,201
If you walked into your home
six months Later,

780
00:51:15,287 --> 00:51:17,721
your kids'd ask Uncle Bill,
"Dad, who is it?"

781
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:21,561
I'll knock your bloody head in!
You're driving me up the wall!

782
00:51:21,647 --> 00:51:23,877
All I want is for you to see life,

783
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:26,800
see what it is
and what it does to you.

784
00:51:31,607 --> 00:51:34,758
I never wanted to hurt you, Harry.

785
00:51:34,847 --> 00:51:36,678
I never want to hurt anybody.

786
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:41,318
No, I suppose not.

787
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:45,360
But you do, Alfie. You do.

788
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:53,485
Want a game of draughts?

789
00:51:56,607 --> 00:51:58,757
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on.

790
00:52:09,247 --> 00:52:11,238
Oi!

791
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:13,675
- How are you?
- Alright.

792
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:15,086
- Look at you.
- I feel alright.

793
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:19,683
- I've got a gaff lined up for you.
- I'm not used to all this noise.

794
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:27,204
I've had six months
of peace and quiet and fresh air.

795
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:29,323
I'd be scared to take a car out now.

796
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:32,479
I've got just the job for you,
all the fresh air you want.

797
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:36,845
Street photography. I do it myself.
Up at Tower Hill. Tons of tourists.

798
00:52:36,927 --> 00:52:39,919
Chat the birds up easy.
They're asking for it.

799
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:43,124
Nothing to it.
"Hold it, lady. little to the left. "

800
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:45,038
"Three for 12 and a tanner. "

801
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:48,164
I think these photographers
are a damn nuisance.

802
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:55,558
I'm sure he's a nice gentleman.
You can have it on your own.

803
00:52:55,647 --> 00:52:58,002
You got film in that camera?
Are you loaded?

804
00:52:58,087 --> 00:53:00,806
- Yeah.
- Good. Good morning to you.

805
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:02,878
Nice to see you, madam.

806
00:53:10,407 --> 00:53:13,877
Come on, lady,
give us a great big smile.

807
00:53:13,967 --> 00:53:15,798
- Here you are, sir.
- Not today.

808
00:53:15,887 --> 00:53:18,526
- They won't bite.
- I don't want my photograph taken.

809
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:20,279
What about the young lady?

810
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,881
- Nor does she.
- How would you know that, sir?

811
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:25,879
What about it? One on your jack...?
On your own?

812
00:53:25,967 --> 00:53:28,242
- Alright, I think I will.
- Vacationing?

813
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:29,885
- No.
- Immigrant?

814
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,958
- In a way.
- Married?

815
00:53:32,047 --> 00:53:34,242
- Sometimes.
- Now?

816
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:36,921
No, not now. How do you want me?

817
00:53:37,007 --> 00:53:40,682
Well, I've got two positions,
straight up or sideways,

818
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:44,476
depending on your nationality.
I'll have you against the ships.

819
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:47,639
Alright. I've always been partial
to the Navy.

820
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:50,922
You look a real treat there, you do.

821
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:53,567
- Ruby, we've no time to waste here.
- It won't take a tick.

822
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:57,356
We've got a fast film in today.
Allow me, madam.

823
00:53:58,207 --> 00:54:01,802
- He's getting a bit choked up.
- Well, don't let it worry you.

824
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:05,482
It doesn't worry me.
It doesn't seem to worry you, either.

825
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,559
- I never let any man worry me.
- I see what you mean.

826
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:12,716
Now, that's lovely. Can you hold it?

827
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:14,843
I'll do my best, young man.

828
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:18,317
- Put a jerk in it!
- I'll put a jerk in you. Hold it!

829
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:22,962
Lovely. That's a real beauty.
Now the close-up. Lick your lips.

830
00:54:25,007 --> 00:54:26,759
Strewth!

831
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,838
Now, watch the dickie bird.

832
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:36,720
Now, what's your address?
And your telephone number.

833
00:54:41,007 --> 00:54:44,522
That's three of each.
It'll be 15 shillings, sir.

834
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:48,758
- Haven't you got any change?
- No, I haven't!

835
00:54:48,847 --> 00:54:53,079
- I'll have to look for some.
- Keep the bloody change!

836
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:57,642
Hello. How about a little souvenir?

837
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,719
You can have an enlargement
for four and six, sir.

838
00:55:03,287 --> 00:55:06,404
"I've got just the job for you,"
Nat says. "Plenty of fresh air. "

839
00:55:06,487 --> 00:55:09,126
Know what?
I got the flu twice in six weeks.

840
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:13,723
So I went back to the hire-car lark.
With the Rolls there.

841
00:55:13,807 --> 00:55:15,798
Oh, yeah.

842
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:22,079
It's very nice of you to come, Alfie.
Wasn't it, Love?

843
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:23,316
Yes, it was.

844
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:26,683
If I'd known you were gonna be here,
I wouldn't have come.

845
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:28,644
I didn't mean that.

846
00:55:28,727 --> 00:55:30,877
Course not.

847
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:35,441
She looks real tired.
Don't you think so, Alfie?

848
00:55:35,527 --> 00:55:36,562
I'm alright.

849
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:40,845
Harry, you think about yourself,
or you'll never get out of here.

850
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:45,796
Yeah. Alfie, do you think you could
give her a lift home in your car?

851
00:55:45,887 --> 00:55:47,843
Harry! Please! No!

852
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,077
It's a long way for her by train.

853
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:55,080
Yeah, I'll take her back.
It's a pleasure.

854
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:56,486
He'll take you back.

855
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:59,684
She didn't want to come
and I didn't want to take her.

856
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:03,159
We both agreed to please Harry.

857
00:56:03,247 --> 00:56:05,966
Looks real ribby, though,
don't she?

858
00:56:07,527 --> 00:56:10,246
To brighten her up,
I'm taking her a roundabout way.

859
00:56:10,327 --> 00:56:12,477
Show her a bit of the scenery.

860
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:14,956
Well, you can only try, can't you?

861
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:20,637
How would you like
a nice cup of tea, girl?

862
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:22,877
I don't want to be any trouble.

863
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:24,958
That's alright.

864
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:30,483
One thing about driving a Rolls,
they're pleased to see you anywhere.

865
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,598
Know what?

866
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:46,121
When she smiles
that little smile of hers,

867
00:56:46,207 --> 00:56:47,606
I'm quite touched by it.

868
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:53,685
Yeah. Now I look at her,
she ain't so ugly after all.

869
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:43,518
It must be hard on you, girl,
old Harry being away so long.

870
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:45,165
still, I'll say this for him,

871
00:57:45,247 --> 00:57:48,956
he could hardly wait for those
visiting days to come round.

872
00:57:51,247 --> 00:57:53,636
Don't worry about him, Lily.

873
00:57:53,727 --> 00:57:55,718
He'll be home soon.

874
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,475
Course he will.

875
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:02,558
Cheer up.

876
00:58:23,527 --> 00:58:26,997
Well, what harm can it do?

877
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,645
Old Harry will never know.

878
00:58:28,727 --> 00:58:32,003
And, even if he did,
he shouldn't begrudge me.

879
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:33,918
Nor her, come to that.

880
00:58:34,007 --> 00:58:36,601
And it'll round off the tea nicely.

881
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:12,640
I don't know
what you must think of me.

882
00:59:13,527 --> 00:59:17,202
I bet you ain't been with many blokes
besides Harry.

883
00:59:20,047 --> 00:59:22,038
I haven't been with anyone.

884
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,042
- Where you going, Love?
- London.

885
01:00:01,127 --> 01:00:04,676
That's a big place for a little girl.
Come on, hop in.

886
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:21,676
Hello, Frank.

887
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:23,200
What do you want to eat?

888
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,676
I'm not hungry.
Just a cup of tea, please.

889
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:30,079
- You must eat something.
- No, thank you. Just tea with sugar.

890
01:00:42,287 --> 01:00:44,676
- Wotcher, Alfie.
- How you doing?

891
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:48,157
You wanna watch your loading ropes
Frank, they look a bit dodgy.

892
01:00:48,247 --> 01:00:50,966
- Ta.
- What's the fancy dress for?

893
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,526
Got a Rolls outside, ain't I?

894
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,757
You're almost a stranger.
Why didn't you turn up?

895
01:00:54,847 --> 01:00:56,678
Sorry, Darling, I couldn't make it.

896
01:00:56,767 --> 01:01:00,282
A small tea and a slice
of buttered toast, please.

897
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:05,362
You won't get far on cups of tea.

898
01:01:05,447 --> 01:01:06,641
I'll be alright.

899
01:01:07,087 --> 01:01:09,043
Who's the mystery?

900
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:10,958
That one, Frank brought in.

901
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:13,561
Watch it, Alfie, that's Frank's bird.

902
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:15,160
It's not my type, anyway.

903
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:21,563
I'll just go and check those ropes,
see they're alright. You OK?

904
01:01:23,367 --> 01:01:27,360
Bit dead in here, though, isn't it?
I think I'll have a tune.

905
01:01:43,727 --> 01:01:46,321
They ain't half got some old ones,
ain't they?

906
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:47,601
Yes.

907
01:01:47,687 --> 01:01:51,202
- Did you come in with Frank?
- Yes. Why?

908
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,926
He's a good bloke, Frank.
A good mate.

909
01:01:54,007 --> 01:01:55,235
Yes, he seems nice.

910
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:58,956
Yeah. He'd share
his last cigarette with you.

911
01:01:59,047 --> 01:02:00,878
Very good-hearted is Frank.

912
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,960
You know what? He'll even share
his birds with his mates.

913
01:02:06,127 --> 01:02:09,437
One bloke told me,
he'll even lend you his wife.

914
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:16,678
Like the Eskimos do.
I wouldn't fancy that.

915
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,883
Well, I mean, she's so bad-tempered.

916
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:21,037
I didn't think he was married.

917
01:02:21,127 --> 01:02:22,879
Yes, he's got at least one wife.

918
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:27,119
Being a long-distance lorry driver,
he's away from home most nights.

919
01:02:27,207 --> 01:02:29,198
Funny, some blokes, aren't they?

920
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,642
I wouldn't like sharing a girl,
would you?

921
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:33,718
- No!
- No.

922
01:02:34,887 --> 01:02:37,799
- Where are you making for?
- Well, London.

923
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,843
- Any particular place?
- Not really.

924
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,885
I'd Like to get a room and a job
if I could.

925
01:02:43,487 --> 01:02:45,921
Here, I might be able to help you.

926
01:02:46,007 --> 01:02:49,158
I know the personnel officer
of a big toffee factory.

927
01:02:49,247 --> 01:02:50,646
A lovely little number.

928
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:53,844
- Could I see you in London?
- I could take you down there.

929
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:57,806
I've got a Rolls-Royce out there.
A radio, heater, the lot.

930
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:00,763
I should have to tell Frank, first.

931
01:03:00,847 --> 01:03:05,204
You daren't risk that. he'll knock
your block off. Mine, too.

932
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:06,959
See that door there?

933
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:10,835
Well, 50 yards down the road
there's a telephone kiosk.

934
01:03:10,927 --> 01:03:12,485
You wait for me there.

935
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:15,877
- I don't like doing that.
- Don't be frightened of me.

936
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:19,721
I ain't a wolf, you know.
Go on, before he comes back.

937
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,526
You don't want sharing, do you?

938
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:24,245
- No.
- Of course you don't.

939
01:03:24,327 --> 01:03:26,522
Go on, away you go.

940
01:03:30,127 --> 01:03:33,722
Would you tell the driver
I came in with that I've had to go?

941
01:03:33,807 --> 01:03:35,798
I'll tell him.

942
01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:39,317
- How much I owe you, Flo?
- One and a penny.

943
01:03:39,407 --> 01:03:42,638
- You ain't going yet?
- I'm in a hurry all of a sudden.

944
01:03:42,727 --> 01:03:44,126
What about your toast?

945
01:03:44,207 --> 01:03:46,880
Give it to Frank.
He could do with a slice.

946
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:48,958
- See you.
- See you, Alfie.

947
01:03:52,887 --> 01:03:54,878
Did you see the way he lapped it up?

948
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:59,040
- Can't see what they all see in him.
- Frank'll go raving mad.

949
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,321
Good.

950
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,476
Sit back and enjoy yourself, girl.

951
01:04:09,567 --> 01:04:12,035
Do your folks at home
know where you're going?

952
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:15,278
- I haven't got any.
- There must be somebody?

953
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:19,842
I want to make a new start in London.

954
01:04:19,927 --> 01:04:23,556
I reckon you've landed on your feet.
you'll have a great life with me.

955
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:32,157
It ain't come up too bad, has it?

956
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:35,603
All it needed was a good wash
and a bit of care and attention.

957
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:38,918
It's quite dainty.
You know what I mean?

958
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:42,966
Here, I no sooner take a pair
of socks off than it washes 'em.

959
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:45,766
And it can cook, too.
A bit limited on the menu.

960
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:49,442
It goes in for Lancashire hotpot
and steak and kidney pie.

961
01:04:49,527 --> 01:04:53,918
They blow you out a bit, but it
does do a marvellous egg custard.

962
01:04:54,007 --> 01:04:56,646
I ain't never tasted nothing like it.

963
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,797
It's pretty fair
on the other, an' all.

964
01:04:58,887 --> 01:05:03,085
A bit on the shy side, but I find
that makes quite a change these days.

965
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:05,283
Oi. Turn it down a bit, Annie.

966
01:05:13,567 --> 01:05:15,125
It's in love, see.

967
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:17,323
Now, when it listens to that stuff,

968
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:21,844
It daydreams that the bloke who threw
it over will one day want it back.

969
01:05:21,927 --> 01:05:25,158
What a bleeding hope.
Just watch how it works.

970
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,522
Scrub, scrub, scrub.

971
01:05:27,607 --> 01:05:30,121
It takes some birds like that.

972
01:05:30,207 --> 01:05:32,767
<i>Not all of 'em.</i>

973
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:34,485
Can I get you a cup of tea, Alfie?

974
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:37,843
Take it easy! You always want
to be doing something.

975
01:05:37,927 --> 01:05:42,398
Here, I had a bird once,
a big fat thing it was,

976
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:44,603
got crossed in love or something.

977
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:46,962
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

978
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:49,083
She used to sit in front of the fire,

979
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:53,718
smoking cigarettes and drinking tea
till her shins were burnt red raw.

980
01:05:53,807 --> 01:05:56,765
"Give us a cup of tea,
bracken shins," I said to it once.

981
01:05:56,847 --> 01:05:59,998
"What?" it said, "You paralysed?"
I soon got rid of it.

982
01:06:00,087 --> 01:06:02,681
Are you visiting your friend
at the sanatorium?

983
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:06,680
Old Harry? I thought I would.
You fancy a ride in the car, girl?

984
01:06:06,767 --> 01:06:08,519
I've some washing to do.

985
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:11,405
You're always bleeding washing.
Take a rest.

986
01:06:11,487 --> 01:06:13,717
I feel better
if I'm doing something.

987
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:17,720
Well, if it makes you feel better,
I'm not going to stop you.

988
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:21,846
Punishes itself, you see. That way
Life can't get at it the same.

989
01:06:22,527 --> 01:06:25,803
- What time will you be back?
- You shouldn't ask me that.

990
01:06:25,887 --> 01:06:29,675
When I go out, I don't know what day
I'll be back, let alone what time.

991
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:32,918
- I'm what is called a free agent.
- Sorry, Alfie.

992
01:06:33,007 --> 01:06:35,157
I just thought
I'd have your meal ready.

993
01:06:35,247 --> 01:06:38,762
Make a meal that's always ready.
Hash or stew or something.

994
01:06:38,847 --> 01:06:43,523
- I thought I'd do something special.
- Get those boots for me, girl.

995
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:49,643
See, even she's started asking me
when I'll be back.

996
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:54,118
Know what? That little remark
could be the writing on the wall.

997
01:06:55,927 --> 01:07:00,239
Annie? When will you start using
those gloves I bought you?

998
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:03,046
you'll ruin your hands
with all that scrubbing.

999
01:07:03,127 --> 01:07:04,446
They don't matter.

1000
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:07,280
They may not matter to you,
but they matter to me.

1001
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:12,487
Nothing puts me off more than a woman
getting hold of me with horny mitts.

1002
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:14,956
You've got pretty little fingers.

1003
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:16,639
They're like a child's.

1004
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,958
Look after 'em for me.

1005
01:07:28,487 --> 01:07:33,003
Sometimes, it gets a dead ghostified
Look come over its little face,

1006
01:07:33,087 --> 01:07:35,885
as though it were all sick inside
with love,

1007
01:07:35,967 --> 01:07:40,882
and its poor mind was stumbling about
looking for a corner to rest in.

1008
01:07:40,967 --> 01:07:42,685
Take the other night...

1009
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:04,762
After what we'd just been through,
it made me really mad.

1010
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,361
There's a time
and a place for everything.

1011
01:08:07,447 --> 01:08:09,881
Even your thoughts
have a proper place.

1012
01:08:22,487 --> 01:08:24,478
Sorry, Alfie.

1013
01:08:26,527 --> 01:08:30,600
Forget him, girl.
I'm here and in the flesh.

1014
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:37,805
Blimey! She looked dead guilty.

1015
01:08:37,887 --> 01:08:40,117
Know what? I was sorry I spoke.

1016
01:08:41,327 --> 01:08:45,161
"Alfie", I says to myself,
"she's as human as you are. "

1017
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:52,880
Well, I'll be off now, girl.
Like to give me a brush down?

1018
01:08:55,727 --> 01:08:58,195
Shall I say you'll be back
about seven?

1019
01:08:58,287 --> 01:09:01,518
Say what you like. Whether I'll
be here or not is another matter.

1020
01:09:01,607 --> 01:09:04,917
You have something ready.
If I'm here I'll eat it.

1021
01:09:08,367 --> 01:09:11,245
You know what, Annie?
You're a nice-Looking girl,

1022
01:09:11,327 --> 01:09:13,397
only you want
to brighten yourself up.

1023
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:17,799
Don't mope about depressed.
Think of others. So long.

1024
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,957
Take care of yourself, Alfie.

1025
01:09:29,087 --> 01:09:32,079
I didn't like leaving it there
on a Sunday, scrubbing away,

1026
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:33,600
but what could I do?

1027
01:09:33,687 --> 01:09:36,884
You know what I mean?
I couldn't take it with me.

1028
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,757
Going up in the world, ain't I?

1029
01:09:54,527 --> 01:09:56,438
Do you know what the rents are here?

1030
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:58,483
15 quid a week!

1031
01:09:58,567 --> 01:10:01,877
That's including central heating,
of course.

1032
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:12,477
you'll never guess
who I'm calling on.

1033
01:10:12,567 --> 01:10:16,242
well, I wouldn't have believed it
myself three months ago.

1034
01:10:20,207 --> 01:10:21,606
I'm here, girl.

1035
01:10:21,687 --> 01:10:26,363
That's life, isn't it? You can
never tell what's round the corner.

1036
01:10:26,447 --> 01:10:28,438
Down one minute, up the next

1037
01:10:28,527 --> 01:10:32,202
You drop a tanner, look around,
and what do you find?

1038
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:34,403
- Ruby!
- Hello, baby!

1039
01:10:34,487 --> 01:10:36,239
Hold it!

1040
01:10:36,327 --> 01:10:38,318
Gotcha!

1041
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:47,278
She's in lovely condition.

1042
01:10:50,727 --> 01:10:54,402
- What are you so impatient about?
- What do you think?

1043
01:10:54,487 --> 01:10:57,081
Don't kiss my ear.
You know what it does to me!

1044
01:10:57,167 --> 01:11:00,682
- What about it?
- Let's at least have a drink first.

1045
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:03,964
- Whisky?
- You haven't got a beer, have you?

1046
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:06,880
Yes, I've probably got a beer
on the ice.

1047
01:11:10,247 --> 01:11:12,397
She gets all this lot off income tax.

1048
01:11:12,487 --> 01:11:16,400
Business expenses, see?
She owns three hairdressers'.

1049
01:11:16,487 --> 01:11:19,604
The thing I like about Ruby,
she's a mature woman.

1050
01:11:19,687 --> 01:11:23,726
You can feel a lifetime
of experience in her fingers.

1051
01:11:23,807 --> 01:11:28,437
Know what I mean? I find I'm going
in more for that sort of woman now.

1052
01:11:28,527 --> 01:11:32,236
Here, don't you dig your nails in
like you did Last Thursday.

1053
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:36,400
- I've got scratches down my back.
- I may do more than that today.

1054
01:11:36,487 --> 01:11:39,638
Great long weals, they are.
She dug her nails right in.

1055
01:11:39,727 --> 01:11:41,922
She's had two husbands.

1056
01:11:42,007 --> 01:11:43,918
Both dead.

1057
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:49,600
And I've a good idea
what they died of.

1058
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:55,763
She don't keep asking do you love her
like young birds do.

1059
01:11:55,847 --> 01:11:57,758
She don't never mention love.

1060
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:00,486
She knows what she wants
and she's gonna get it.

1061
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:03,161
If there's any going.

1062
01:12:03,247 --> 01:12:05,238
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1063
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,964
Alfie, don't you ever think

1064
01:12:09,047 --> 01:12:12,119
about bringing your girlfriends
flowers or candy?

1065
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:14,675
I often think about it,
but I never do it.

1066
01:12:14,767 --> 01:12:17,201
Not unless they're in hospital.

1067
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,125
Don't put your wet glass
on my polished table!

1068
01:12:21,207 --> 01:12:23,198
You're getting bleeding fussy.

1069
01:12:23,287 --> 01:12:25,676
- I am not getting bleeding fussy.
- You are.

1070
01:12:25,767 --> 01:12:27,758
I am not fussy!

1071
01:12:29,767 --> 01:12:32,281
Hello!

1072
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:34,517
She's in beautiful condition.

1073
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:39,681
- You're a little sexpot, ain't you?
- Am I?

1074
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:42,440
Yeah.
You're a little lust-box, ain't you?

1075
01:12:42,527 --> 01:12:44,757
My little lust-box!

1076
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:46,838
I might settle down with her.

1077
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:50,522
With a wife like Ruby, you wouldn't
want nothing on the side.

1078
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:55,798
Bedroom!

1079
01:13:00,527 --> 01:13:03,325
Here, come and have a look
at this a minute.

1080
01:13:05,727 --> 01:13:08,799
Great, isn't it?
Have you caught the ceiling?

1081
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,401
Look at the size of that bath!
King-size.

1082
01:13:13,487 --> 01:13:16,001
A bit of a tight squeeze
with two of us in it.

1083
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:19,841
You can have a lot of fun
splashing about and whatnot.

1084
01:13:22,727 --> 01:13:26,720
There have been times when I've felt
lucky to get out of that bath alive.

1085
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:17,603
- Hello, lads.
- Hello, Alfie.

1086
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:19,564
- What you having?
- Brown ale.

1087
01:14:36,367 --> 01:14:38,323
Have you got the car outside?

1088
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,523
I don't think I'll go up the club.

1089
01:14:40,607 --> 01:14:44,919
I've got this northern bird, Annie,
staying at my gaff. Can't half cook.

1090
01:14:45,007 --> 01:14:47,282
- Cook?!
- What's cooking got to do with it?

1091
01:14:47,367 --> 01:14:50,086
She don't like it if he don't
come home for his meals. Eh, Alfie?

1092
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:55,560
No. She does some handsome nosh-ups.
Steak and kidney pie, hotpot.

1093
01:14:55,647 --> 01:14:57,000
I love her cooking, I do.

1094
01:14:57,087 --> 01:15:00,716
I thought you was looking
a bit blown out. Eh, Vi?

1095
01:15:00,807 --> 01:15:04,959
- What do you mean, blown out?
- It's just the appearance, Alfie.

1096
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:08,517
- What appearance?
- well, you look all puffed up.

1097
01:15:08,607 --> 01:15:10,040
Blown out.

1098
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:12,038
Sort of... poncified.

1099
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:16,437
Poncified? I've never felt fitter
in all my life.

1100
01:15:16,527 --> 01:15:18,722
He wasn't saying you wasn't fit.

1101
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:22,880
No. You just look different,
that's all. Don't he, Vi?

1102
01:15:22,967 --> 01:15:24,525
What's bleeding different?

1103
01:15:24,607 --> 01:15:29,044
That bird Annie's putting the block
on you, mate, and you can't see it.

1104
01:15:29,127 --> 01:15:31,402
- What do you say, Perce?
- Looks that way.

1105
01:15:31,487 --> 01:15:33,398
She's only looking after me.

1106
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,876
In 12 months,
you won't recognise yourself.

1107
01:15:35,967 --> 01:15:38,481
You'll be stuffed to the ears
with hotpot.

1108
01:15:59,287 --> 01:16:01,721
- How you going, mate?
- I thought it was you.

1109
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,480
Remember that day
you came in the Busy Bee?

1110
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:05,761
What day was that?

1111
01:16:05,847 --> 01:16:08,680
Couple of weeks back.
You was in a chauffeur's uniform.

1112
01:16:08,767 --> 01:16:10,325
Oh, yeah. What about it?

1113
01:16:10,407 --> 01:16:13,524
Did you slope off with a little girl
from Sheffield called Annie

1114
01:16:13,607 --> 01:16:15,245
when my back was turned?

1115
01:16:15,327 --> 01:16:18,205
Who, me? No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1116
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:19,515
You're a bloody liar!

1117
01:16:19,607 --> 01:16:22,280
Watch the suit.
It's just back from the cleaner's.

1118
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:36,758
Is that you, Alfie?

1119
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,125
Yeah, it's me.

1120
01:18:43,287 --> 01:18:45,801
I'm late, ain't I? Start rucking me!

1121
01:18:46,647 --> 01:18:50,276
What happened?
You've got an awful black eye.

1122
01:18:55,807 --> 01:18:58,605
Blimey! He's injured me for Life!

1123
01:18:58,687 --> 01:19:02,566
- Where's that steak you bought?
- I've made you steak and kidney pie.

1124
01:19:02,647 --> 01:19:05,764
I'm fed up with hotpots
and steak and kidney pies!

1125
01:19:05,847 --> 01:19:08,680
Why can't we have something
out of a can for a change?

1126
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:12,203
Corned beef or Spam.
Handsome grub, that was.

1127
01:19:12,287 --> 01:19:14,562
You said you liked
my steak and kidney pies.

1128
01:19:14,647 --> 01:19:18,322
If I get that lot on top of a skinful
of beer, I can hardly draw my breath!

1129
01:19:18,407 --> 01:19:22,525
I'll get an 'orrible feeling of being
full up, blown out, poncified.

1130
01:19:22,607 --> 01:19:25,440
You said you loved
that feeling of being full.

1131
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:29,440
What I loved once and what I love now
are two different things.

1132
01:19:29,527 --> 01:19:31,324
Where's my button-down shirt?

1133
01:19:31,407 --> 01:19:33,318
Your blue one? In the drawer.

1134
01:19:33,407 --> 01:19:36,604
- No, the pink one.
- I washed it. it'll soon be dry.

1135
01:19:36,687 --> 01:19:39,599
Why did you wash it?
I only wore it for a few hours.

1136
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:41,803
I thought it'd feel fresher for you.

1137
01:19:41,887 --> 01:19:45,436
I do believe you only wash
to fill in your bleeding time!

1138
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:47,916
- Why should I?
- To get him out of your mind!

1139
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:49,076
Get who out of my mind?

1140
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:52,398
That bleeding Tony you write about
in your little diary!

1141
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:55,559
You can't get outta your mind
or something!

1142
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,639
Alfie, have you been in my bag
and read my diary?

1143
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:00,365
Why shouldn't I?

1144
01:20:00,447 --> 01:20:03,325
You shouldn't
because them's my secret thoughts.

1145
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:06,080
You ain't entitled
to secret thoughts living with me!

1146
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:07,805
Everyone's entitled to them.

1147
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:10,799
Then you shouldn't write them down
and let me see 'em!

1148
01:20:11,487 --> 01:20:13,398
I only wrote them
to get them out of me.

1149
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:16,285
I'll show you what I think of you,
your secret thoughts

1150
01:20:16,367 --> 01:20:19,165
and your bleeding
steak and kidney pie!

1151
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:43,560
And don't take nothing
that don't belong to you, either!

1152
01:20:59,807 --> 01:21:01,877
Don't let your custard spoil.

1153
01:21:01,967 --> 01:21:03,958
It's in the oven.

1154
01:21:22,367 --> 01:21:24,358
Annie?

1155
01:21:25,407 --> 01:21:28,399
Annie? Come back! I didn't mean it!

1156
01:22:26,767 --> 01:22:28,758
Come in.

1157
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:34,999
You're a bit early, girl.

1158
01:22:35,087 --> 01:22:37,078
I didn't want to be late.

1159
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:41,558
- Is he coming?
- Yeah, about two o'clock, he said.

1160
01:22:41,647 --> 01:22:43,638
Here, give us your bag.

1161
01:22:45,247 --> 01:22:46,999
Blimey!

1162
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,442
Your hands ain't half cold.

1163
01:22:49,527 --> 01:22:51,722
You ain't worrying, are you?

1164
01:22:51,807 --> 01:22:53,763
A bit.

1165
01:22:53,847 --> 01:22:56,645
Yeah, you're all dark under the eyes.

1166
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:58,604
I couldn't sleep last night.

1167
01:23:00,607 --> 01:23:02,916
Well...

1168
01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:06,886
And you can get ready for him
when you want to.

1169
01:23:08,407 --> 01:23:09,237
Thanks.

1170
01:23:22,807 --> 01:23:25,958
I've let myself
in for something this time alright.

1171
01:23:26,047 --> 01:23:28,720
It was that day
I took her up the river, see.

1172
01:23:28,807 --> 01:23:31,275
Round about three months ago, it was.

1173
01:23:31,367 --> 01:23:33,835
That was something
I thought I got for nothing.

1174
01:23:34,527 --> 01:23:37,485
But it don't never work out
that way, does it?

1175
01:23:37,567 --> 01:23:40,286
So, I agrees to help her
and lay it all on.

1176
01:23:40,367 --> 01:23:43,086
well,
it was the least I could do,

1177
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:46,318
knowing old Harry, an' all.
See what I mean?

1178
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:49,918
Come in, mate.

1179
01:23:54,607 --> 01:23:56,563
Well, here we are.

1180
01:23:56,647 --> 01:23:58,956
What do you mean, here we are?

1181
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:01,038
I mean
you've come to the right place.

1182
01:24:01,127 --> 01:24:05,518
And this is the young lady
I talked to you about on the phone.

1183
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:07,199
Pleased to meet you.

1184
01:24:07,287 --> 01:24:10,085
- Got your gear with you?
- Don't ask questions.

1185
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:15,560
Sorry. This is the room where
you can examine this young lady.

1186
01:24:15,647 --> 01:24:18,400
And why should I
examine this young lady?

1187
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:21,320
Well, you got to, ain't you,
before you do it?

1188
01:24:21,407 --> 01:24:24,524
- Before I do what?
- Do what you've come to do.

1189
01:24:24,607 --> 01:24:27,075
Quiet, Alfie.
There must be some mistake.

1190
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:31,001
You are the gentleman
I talked to last Thursday night?

1191
01:24:31,087 --> 01:24:34,602
- Alfie, please, be quiet.
- Don't worry, my dear.

1192
01:24:41,607 --> 01:24:44,679
Now, I must have a serious talk
with you both.

1193
01:24:44,767 --> 01:24:47,600
- Are you two married?
- Us two married?!

1194
01:24:47,687 --> 01:24:49,279
Blimey! Do we Look it?

1195
01:24:49,367 --> 01:24:53,246
No. I mean, she's a married woman,
but I'm a single man.

1196
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:56,999
Is there any chance of you
getting married in the near future?

1197
01:24:57,087 --> 01:25:00,079
I very much doubt that.
What do you say, Lily?

1198
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:02,397
But you are the putative father?

1199
01:25:02,927 --> 01:25:04,485
The what?

1200
01:25:04,567 --> 01:25:07,479
Me?! I'm nothing.
I'm just obliging a friend.

1201
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:09,478
Well, that's unusual.

1202
01:25:09,567 --> 01:25:11,080
It's very unusual.

1203
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:14,079
You are the man who...
is going to help me?

1204
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:18,046
Her old man's in a sanatorium, see?
And she's had a moral lapse.

1205
01:25:18,127 --> 01:25:20,687
- See what I mean?
- I'm not quite sure that I do.

1206
01:25:20,767 --> 01:25:22,598
It'll never happen again.

1207
01:25:22,687 --> 01:25:26,236
She needs helping because
her marriage would look very dodgy

1208
01:25:26,327 --> 01:25:29,080
if her husband came out
at this stage of the game. Got me?

1209
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,078
She's got three other kids as well.

1210
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,283
And where do you fit into all this?

1211
01:25:33,367 --> 01:25:35,437
Well, she had no place to go, see?

1212
01:25:35,527 --> 01:25:37,836
Well, that's most altruistic.

1213
01:25:38,927 --> 01:25:40,645
I hope you both

1214
01:25:40,727 --> 01:25:43,878
appreciate the seriousness
of this case.

1215
01:25:43,967 --> 01:25:47,482
To terminate a pregnancy
after 28 days is a criminal offence

1216
01:25:47,567 --> 01:25:50,957
punishable in a court of law
with seven years' jail.

1217
01:25:51,047 --> 01:25:52,799
Do you understand this, you two?

1218
01:25:57,047 --> 01:25:58,366
Yeah.

1219
01:25:58,447 --> 01:26:02,565
Not only that, but it's a crime
against the unborn child.

1220
01:26:02,647 --> 01:26:06,322
It's a course never to be
embarked upon lightly.

1221
01:26:07,247 --> 01:26:10,045
You must consider
the circumstances thoroughly

1222
01:26:10,127 --> 01:26:12,766
before you go through
with your decision.

1223
01:26:12,847 --> 01:26:16,840
Since afterwards it will be too late
to change your mind.

1224
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:22,086
Have you given the matter
your fullest consideration?

1225
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:25,045
- What do you say, Lily?
- I've no way out.

1226
01:26:25,127 --> 01:26:27,322
Then you've decided
to go through with it?

1227
01:26:27,407 --> 01:26:29,398
Yes, I must.

1228
01:26:30,367 --> 01:26:32,198
Then I might be able to help you.

1229
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:35,165
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1230
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:36,999
Have you got the money?

1231
01:26:37,887 --> 01:26:40,196
Yeah, the money.
The young lady's got it.

1232
01:26:40,287 --> 01:26:43,836
- That'll be £30.
- 25. That's the figure we discussed.

1233
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:45,918
Very well, then, 25.

1234
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:55,239
Right. Very well.

1235
01:26:55,327 --> 01:26:58,637
Right, young lady,
would you care to follow me?

1236
01:26:58,727 --> 01:27:02,800
- I'll need some boiling water.
- The kettle's on the stove in there.

1237
01:27:02,887 --> 01:27:04,878
Good.

1238
01:27:25,487 --> 01:27:27,478
I hate anything like this.

1239
01:27:28,367 --> 01:27:32,758
My understanding of women
only goes as far as the pleasure.

1240
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:36,157
When it comes to the pain,
I'm like every other bloke.

1241
01:27:36,247 --> 01:27:38,238
I don't wanna know.

1242
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:43,283
Have you done?!

1243
01:27:43,367 --> 01:27:45,358
Almost everything I can do.

1244
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:48,483
- Can she go home now, then?
- Lord, no!

1245
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:53,004
It's only been induced. It hasn't
happened yet. That comes later.

1246
01:27:53,087 --> 01:27:57,000
If her temperature rises rapidly,
give her two of these.

1247
01:27:57,087 --> 01:28:00,079
- I'll leave you six.
- How will I know?

1248
01:28:00,167 --> 01:28:03,477
well, if she starts to sweat,
give her two.

1249
01:28:04,727 --> 01:28:05,716
Here, mate.

1250
01:28:05,807 --> 01:28:07,957
Shouldn't you see the job through,

1251
01:28:08,047 --> 01:28:10,880
considering
how much you've been paid?

1252
01:28:11,087 --> 01:28:13,078
Two if she sweats.

1253
01:28:34,087 --> 01:28:36,078
How you feeling, girl?

1254
01:28:39,327 --> 01:28:42,080
He gave me these tablets
to give to you.

1255
01:28:45,047 --> 01:28:47,641
Take two if your temperature goes up.

1256
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:55,158
You do look old, girl.

1257
01:28:58,767 --> 01:29:01,201
He got his money easy.

1258
01:29:10,287 --> 01:29:12,278
Not so loud. My landlady'll hear!

1259
01:29:13,367 --> 01:29:15,119
I can't help it!

1260
01:29:15,207 --> 01:29:16,799
This pain!

1261
01:29:16,887 --> 01:29:20,516
- Lily!
- This pain! I can't help..!

1262
01:29:21,367 --> 01:29:24,325
I'm sorry, Lily. I'm sorry.
I had to do it.

1263
01:29:24,407 --> 01:29:27,205
If my landlady heard,
she'd have the ambulance here!

1264
01:29:27,287 --> 01:29:29,039
Doctors, police, the lot!

1265
01:29:29,127 --> 01:29:31,083
All this
would have been for nothing!

1266
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:33,556
See what I mean?
That's why I had to do it.

1267
01:30:06,127 --> 01:30:09,324
Is there something I can get you,
Lily?

1268
01:30:12,207 --> 01:30:14,198
would you like a cup of tea?

1269
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:20,755
No. You go.

1270
01:30:20,847 --> 01:30:22,838
I'm better on my own.

1271
01:30:24,767 --> 01:30:26,758
There's nothing you can do.

1272
01:30:27,447 --> 01:30:29,961
You'll be alright, will you?

1273
01:30:36,207 --> 01:30:38,357
You're sure you'll be alright?

1274
01:30:48,447 --> 01:30:51,917
I know it don't look nice,
going off and leaving her.

1275
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:56,879
But what do look nice
when you get close up to it?

1276
01:31:51,087 --> 01:31:53,396
Come on, Malcolm!

1277
01:31:53,487 --> 01:31:56,524
You naughty boy!
You're keeping everyone waiting.

1278
01:32:10,287 --> 01:32:14,041
Suzanne Elizabeth, I baptise thee
in the name of the Father

1279
01:32:14,127 --> 01:32:17,358
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.

1280
01:32:23,847 --> 01:32:27,760
And now we join together
in the family prayer of Christians.

1281
01:32:27,847 --> 01:32:30,315
Our Father,
which art in heaven,

1282
01:32:30,407 --> 01:32:32,557
Hallowed be thy name.

1283
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:37,038
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven...

1284
01:33:04,927 --> 01:33:06,918
Who's Daddy's best boy, eh?

1285
01:33:07,367 --> 01:33:11,758
Who's Daddy's best boy?
Who's the best boy in the world?

1286
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:41,838
Lily?

1287
01:33:45,967 --> 01:33:47,958
Is it all over?

1288
01:33:49,807 --> 01:33:51,798
Yes.

1289
01:33:53,887 --> 01:33:58,563
- I'll be ready to go in a minute.
- There's no hurry, girl. No hurry.

1290
01:34:05,607 --> 01:34:06,517
Don't.

1291
01:34:10,047 --> 01:34:11,639
Don't go in there.

1292
01:35:41,447 --> 01:35:44,757
I could have dropped on the spot
with the shock.

1293
01:35:45,567 --> 01:35:48,001
All I was expecting to see was...

1294
01:35:50,887 --> 01:35:55,722
Come to think of it, I don't rightly
know what I was expecting to see.

1295
01:35:57,967 --> 01:36:02,483
certainly not
this perfectly formed being.

1296
01:36:05,447 --> 01:36:07,836
I half expected it to cry out.

1297
01:36:08,807 --> 01:36:11,367
It didn't, of course.
It couldn't have done.

1298
01:36:11,447 --> 01:36:13,961
It could never have had
any life in it.

1299
01:36:14,047 --> 01:36:17,835
- Not a proper life of its own.
- No, I suppose not.

1300
01:36:20,847 --> 01:36:22,838
still...

1301
01:36:23,527 --> 01:36:26,917
.. it must have had some life,
of course.

1302
01:36:27,007 --> 01:36:31,717
And... as it lay there
so quiet and so still...

1303
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,926
.. it quite touched me.

1304
01:36:36,007 --> 01:36:39,079
And I started praying or something.

1305
01:36:39,167 --> 01:36:43,843
Saying things like, "God help me!"
and things like that.

1306
01:36:44,407 --> 01:36:46,602
And then I starts to cry.

1307
01:36:46,687 --> 01:36:50,839
Straight up. The tears
were running down my face.

1308
01:36:50,927 --> 01:36:54,158
All salty. Like I was a kid myself.

1309
01:36:54,887 --> 01:36:57,276
Crying for him, you mean, Alf?

1310
01:36:57,367 --> 01:36:59,642
No, not for him.

1311
01:36:59,727 --> 01:37:01,718
He was past it.

1312
01:37:01,807 --> 01:37:04,241
For my bleeding self!

1313
01:37:04,327 --> 01:37:07,524
You know, it don't half bring it home
to you what you are

1314
01:37:07,607 --> 01:37:12,442
when you see a helpless little thing
like that lying in your own hands.

1315
01:37:13,447 --> 01:37:15,961
He'd have been quite perfect.

1316
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:18,197
And I thought to myself,

1317
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:22,757
"You know what, Alfie?
You know what you done?"

1318
01:37:23,727 --> 01:37:25,718
"You murdered him. "

1319
01:37:29,047 --> 01:37:32,562
Well, there's nothing you can do
about it now, Alf.

1320
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:35,766
- Will you lend me 25 quid, Nat?
- Don't be bloody funny!

1321
01:37:35,847 --> 01:37:40,125
- That's all I've got in the world.
- Take this watch as security.

1322
01:37:40,207 --> 01:37:42,960
If I haven't paid you back
in two weeks, you can sell it.

1323
01:37:43,047 --> 01:37:45,845
I don't want no security.
I'll give you the money.

1324
01:37:45,927 --> 01:37:47,679
Thanks very much, Nat.

1325
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:09,519
Well, that's that.

1326
01:38:14,447 --> 01:38:16,438
You all ready?

1327
01:38:16,527 --> 01:38:18,518
Come on, I'll run you home.

1328
01:38:20,407 --> 01:38:21,840
I'd sooner go on my own.

1329
01:38:21,927 --> 01:38:24,999
You say that again,
you will go home on your own.

1330
01:38:25,087 --> 01:38:26,839
- I want to.
- OK by me.

1331
01:38:26,927 --> 01:38:30,363
There's a bus to Waterloo
or a Green Line all the way.

1332
01:38:30,447 --> 01:38:33,041
Here. This is for little Phil.

1333
01:38:33,127 --> 01:38:34,446
Who?

1334
01:38:34,527 --> 01:38:38,805
Phil, your youngest. The one
who writes all them squiggly letters.

1335
01:38:38,887 --> 01:38:41,037
- What is it?
- You wanna see it?

1336
01:38:44,967 --> 01:38:47,720
I bought it a long, long time ago.

1337
01:38:47,807 --> 01:38:49,877
For a little kid I used to know.

1338
01:38:50,767 --> 01:38:52,758
Catch.

1339
01:39:01,687 --> 01:39:03,484
Tell him it's from his Uncle Alfie.

1340
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,403
Come on, mate.

1341
01:39:14,487 --> 01:39:16,478
I'll take you home.

1342
01:39:54,647 --> 01:39:57,207
I'm definitely gonna settle down
with this Ruby.

1343
01:39:57,287 --> 01:39:59,517
I'm fed up with being on the move.

1344
01:40:07,327 --> 01:40:11,445
You know, I find I'm not stalking
these young birds any more.

1345
01:40:17,607 --> 01:40:21,520
Ruby! Where are you, girl?

1346
01:40:21,607 --> 01:40:25,202
- Alfie?
- I thought I'd give you a surprise.

1347
01:40:25,287 --> 01:40:28,723
I'll be right out!
Make yourself a drink.

1348
01:40:28,807 --> 01:40:30,798
Alright.

1349
01:40:36,887 --> 01:40:38,718
I was sleeping.

1350
01:40:38,807 --> 01:40:42,083
- I've got a headache. I took a pill.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1351
01:40:42,167 --> 01:40:46,001
- You said you were on a job today.
- It fell through. Want a drink?

1352
01:40:46,087 --> 01:40:51,115
No thanks. You better go, Darling.
I've got a splitting headache.

1353
01:40:51,207 --> 01:40:54,802
Alright. You better have these
now I've brought 'em.

1354
01:40:57,807 --> 01:40:59,957
Alfie, what a thing for you to do.

1355
01:41:00,047 --> 01:41:02,402
I never thought
I'd live to see the day.

1356
01:41:02,487 --> 01:41:05,081
- I like surprising a woman.
- You did that.

1357
01:41:05,167 --> 01:41:08,079
Look at the wrapper.
They're not off a barrow.

1358
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:09,885
I can see that.

1359
01:41:09,967 --> 01:41:12,845
They're lovely. Really lovely.
Thank you.

1360
01:41:12,927 --> 01:41:15,600
- I'll go. You take an aspirin, girl.
- I will.

1361
01:41:15,687 --> 01:41:17,564
- That's new.
- New? What?

1362
01:41:17,647 --> 01:41:19,763
That radio. Where did you get that?

1363
01:41:19,847 --> 01:41:22,281
I picked it up cheap.

1364
01:41:22,367 --> 01:41:25,803
Will you ring me tomorrow?
I'll be alright then.

1365
01:41:25,887 --> 01:41:29,436
I'll come around lunch time.
We might have a session.

1366
01:41:29,527 --> 01:41:32,758
- Yeah, why not?
- Right. See you.

1367
01:41:36,687 --> 01:41:38,518
Alfie?

1368
01:41:38,607 --> 01:41:40,518
Yeah?

1369
01:41:40,607 --> 01:41:43,041
I'm sorry about the headache.

1370
01:41:43,127 --> 01:41:45,687
- I'll make it up to you.
- Sure.

1371
01:41:48,727 --> 01:41:51,241
- What's that?
- What?

1372
01:41:51,327 --> 01:41:53,966
- That?
- It's a guitar.

1373
01:41:54,807 --> 01:41:58,117
- You doing it with groups now?
- Don't be so disgusting!

1374
01:41:58,207 --> 01:42:01,244
And the radio. You've got
a bloke in there, ain't you?

1375
01:42:01,327 --> 01:42:04,285
- It's none of your business!
- You pick him up cheap, too?

1376
01:42:04,367 --> 01:42:05,800
There is no-one in there!

1377
01:42:05,887 --> 01:42:08,560
I honestly
thought you had a headache.

1378
01:42:08,647 --> 01:42:11,115
- What a mug I've grown into!
- Get out of here!

1379
01:42:11,207 --> 01:42:13,198
I have a splitting headache!

1380
01:42:40,127 --> 01:42:42,766
Why him? Better than me?

1381
01:42:42,847 --> 01:42:45,441
What's he got that I haven't?

1382
01:42:45,527 --> 01:42:47,518
Apart from long hair?

1383
01:42:48,607 --> 01:42:50,757
Well?

1384
01:42:50,847 --> 01:42:54,157
Come on, let's have it.
What's he bleeding got?

1385
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,719
He's younger than you are.

1386
01:42:59,327 --> 01:43:00,362
You got it?

1387
01:43:38,927 --> 01:43:41,839
"He's younger than you are. "
That's what she said.

1388
01:43:41,927 --> 01:43:45,522
Anybody would think I was
doddering about on crutches.

1389
01:43:45,607 --> 01:43:48,917
Trouble is,
I still keep thinking about her.

1390
01:43:49,007 --> 01:43:50,804
I can't get her out of my mind.

1391
01:43:50,887 --> 01:43:53,401
Who'd have thought
a ruddy great lust-box like her

1392
01:43:53,487 --> 01:43:55,842
would have found her way
into anybody's feelings?

1393
01:43:55,927 --> 01:43:59,920
She might have looked a hard case,
but underneath she was quite mumsy.

1394
01:44:00,007 --> 01:44:03,079
And she was in beautiful condition.

1395
01:44:03,167 --> 01:44:07,319
Do you know, I'm beginning to think
she was beautiful.

1396
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:11,116
After all, it ain't through the eyes
that you feel beauty,

1397
01:44:11,207 --> 01:44:14,961
it's how the heart hungers for
something that makes it beautiful.

1398
01:44:18,487 --> 01:44:19,886
Oi!

1399
01:44:24,607 --> 01:44:25,722
Siddie.

1400
01:44:25,807 --> 01:44:27,798
Alfie. Hello.

1401
01:44:27,887 --> 01:44:29,878
I ain't seen you in ages.

1402
01:44:29,967 --> 01:44:31,844
You didn't turn up.

1403
01:44:31,927 --> 01:44:33,758
Look, I can explain that.

1404
01:44:33,847 --> 01:44:35,963
I ain't half missed you.

1405
01:44:36,047 --> 01:44:38,038
I like that gear.

1406
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:43,202
Where you going?
I've got the car round the corner.

1407
01:44:43,287 --> 01:44:46,962
- What about it?
- I can't, I'm gonna meet my husband.

1408
01:44:47,647 --> 01:44:51,879
It's nice material. Still,
you always was a snappy dresser.

1409
01:44:52,887 --> 01:44:55,481
What about Sunday, then?

1410
01:44:55,567 --> 01:44:58,081
- No, I'm not sure.
- Come on.

1411
01:44:58,167 --> 01:45:00,158
Same time, same place?

1412
01:45:01,327 --> 01:45:04,683
- We'll see.
- I'll wait for you for five minutes.

1413
01:45:04,767 --> 01:45:06,723
Don't forget your napkin.

1414
01:45:06,807 --> 01:45:11,164
I'm like the Boy Scouts, I am,
always prepared.

1415
01:45:11,247 --> 01:45:13,283
See you, then?

1416
01:45:13,367 --> 01:45:15,358
Maybe.

1417
01:45:24,767 --> 01:45:26,758
You know what?

1418
01:45:26,847 --> 01:45:30,806
When I look back on my little life
and the birds I've known,

1419
01:45:30,887 --> 01:45:33,481
and think of all the things
they've done for me

1420
01:45:33,567 --> 01:45:36,035
and the little I've done for them,

1421
01:45:36,127 --> 01:45:39,483
you'd think I'd had the best of it
all along the line.

1422
01:45:39,567 --> 01:45:41,558
But what have I got out of it?

1423
01:45:41,647 --> 01:45:46,277
I've got a bob or two,
some decent clothes, a car.

1424
01:45:46,367 --> 01:45:49,916
I've got my health back
and I ain't attached.

1425
01:45:59,527 --> 01:46:01,165
But I ain't got my peace of mind.

1426
01:46:01,247 --> 01:46:04,603
And if you ain't got that,
you ain't got nothing.

1427
01:46:04,687 --> 01:46:08,600
I don't know, it seems to me
that if they ain't got you one way,

1428
01:46:08,687 --> 01:46:10,359
they've got you another.

1429
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:12,244
So what's the answer?

1430
01:46:12,327 --> 01:46:14,318
That's what I keep asking myself.

1431
01:46:14,407 --> 01:46:16,318
What's it all about?

1432
01:46:16,407 --> 01:46:18,398
Know what I mean?

1433
01:46:33,807 --> 01:46:35,798
Come on, boy.
