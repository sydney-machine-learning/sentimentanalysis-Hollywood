<i>Mr. Dufresne,</i>

18
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:11,731
<i>describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.</i>

19
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:18,191
It was very bitter.

20
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:23,392
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

21
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:27,859
And she said...
she wanted a divorce in Reno.

22
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,978
What was your response?

23
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,021
I told her I would not grant one.

24
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:35,350
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

25
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:39,200
Those were the words you used,
Mr. Dufresne, according to your neighbors.

26
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:43,996
If they say so. I really don't
remember. I was upset.

27
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:47,429
What happened after you
argued with your wife?

28
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,328
She packed a bag.

29
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,586
She packed a bag to go
and stay with... Mr. Quentin.

30
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:56,963
<i>Glenn Quentin.</i>

31
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:59,432
<i>A golf pro at the
Snowdon Hills Country Club.</i>

32
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:02,391
<i>The man you discovered
was your wife's lover.</i>

33
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:06,519
Did you follow her?

34
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,642
I went to a few bars first.

35
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:12,904
Later, I...
drove to his house to confront them.

36
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:16,274
They weren't home, so I...
parked in the turnout,

37
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:17,942
<i>and waited.</i>

38
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:19,636
<i>With what intention?</i>

39
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:22,113
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

40
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:24,407
<i>I was confused.</i>

41
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,155
<i>Drunk.</i>

42
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:30,914
<i>I think... mostly,
I wanted to scare them.</i>

43
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:34,150
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

44
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,820
No. I was sobering up.

45
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:40,256
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

46
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:43,902
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

47
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:46,095
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

48
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:50,474
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

49
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:55,627
and finds your wife in bed with her
lover, riddled with .38 caliber bullets.

50
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,027
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

51
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:02,946
Yes, it does.

52
00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:08,218
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place.

53
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,497
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

54
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:17,594
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found.

55
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:20,472
So, there could be no comparison
made between your gun

56
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:25,223
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

57
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:33,064
And that also... is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

58
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:36,429
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

59
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,196
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:50,326
<i>♪ And would I be sure that this ♪</i>

61
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:55,336
<i>♪ Is love beyond compare... ♪</i>

62
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:02,404
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence. you know all the facts.</i>

63
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,373
<i>We have the accused at
the scene of the crime.</i>

64
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,292
<i>We have footprints, tire tracks,</i>

65
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:10,921
<i>bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,</i>

66
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:12,432
<i>likewise with fingerprints.</i>

67
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:14,183
<i>And most of all,</i>

68
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:16,961
<i>we have a beautiful young
woman and her lover</i>

69
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:19,026
<i>lying dead in each other's arms.</i>

70
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,564
<i>They... had sinned.</i>

71
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:29,495
<i>But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?</i>

72
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:32,248
Now, while you think about that...

73
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,664
...think about this.

74
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:38,791
A revolver holds six bullets.

75
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,251
Not eight.

76
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:43,796
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

77
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:46,925
That at least could be
understood, if not condoned.

78
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:50,636
No. This was revenge...

79
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:54,523
of a much more brutal and
cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

80
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:56,851
<i>Four bullets per victim.</i>

81
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:03,316
<i>Not six shots fired, but eight.
That means that he fired the gun empty,</i>

82
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:06,390
<i>and then stopped to reload...</i>

83
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:09,164
<i>...so that he could shoot each of them again.</i>

84
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:12,033
<i>An extra bullet per lover.</i>

85
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:14,160
<i>Right in the head.</i>

86
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:23,127
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

87
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:25,760
It chills my blood just to look at you.

88
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:30,176
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine,

89
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:34,101
I hereby order you to serve two
life sentences, back to back.

90
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:37,717
One for each of your victims. So be it.

91
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,007
Sit.

92
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:11,175
We see by your file you've served
20 years of a life sentence.

93
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:12,844
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:15,388
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

95
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,978
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

96
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:21,565
I mean, I learned my lesson.

97
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:25,903
I can honestly say... I'm a changed man.

98
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:31,654
I'm no longer a danger to society.

99
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:34,120
That's God's honest truth.

100
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:12,479
Hey, Red. How'd it go?

101
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,190
Same old shit. Different day.

102
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:19,498
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

103
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:22,655
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

104
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:24,132
It happens.

105
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,000
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

106
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:29,662
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

107
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,051
- Four.
- Five.

108
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:35,343
<i>There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.</i>

109
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:37,345
<i>I'm the guy who can get it for you.</i>

110
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:40,556
<i>Cigarettes, a bag of reefer...
if that's your thing...</i>

111
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:44,127
<i>a bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high-school graduation.</i>

112
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:46,446
<i>Damn near anything, within reason.</i>

113
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:50,023
<i>Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.</i>

114
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,739
<i>So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949</i>

115
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,159
<i>and asked me to smuggle Rita
Hayworth into the prison for him,</i>

116
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,625
<i>I told him, "No problem."</i>

117
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:46,306
<i>Andy came to Shawshank Prison</i>

118
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:50,618
<i>in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.</i>

119
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,898
<i>On the outside he had been
vice-president of a large Portland bank.</i>

120
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,383
<i>Good work for a man as young as he was.</i>

121
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:03,928
Hey, Red.

122
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,435
Do you speak English, butt steak?
You follow this officer.

123
00:10:57,027 --> 00:11:01,489
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking
heap of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

124
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,954
<i>Hey, fish! Come over here.</i>

125
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:21,889
Come on, fish.

126
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:28,975
Taking bets today, Red?

127
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:31,060
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

128
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:34,564
- Smokes. Put me down for two.
- All right. Who's your horse?

129
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:39,864
That little sack of shit... eighth...
eighth from the front. He'll be first.

130
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,588
All bullshit. I'll take that action.

131
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,323
- Yeah, me too.
- You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

132
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:46,325
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

133
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:49,211
I'll take... t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

134
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:52,673
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

135
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:55,334
Fresh fish!

136
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:59,505
Fresh fish today!
We're reeling them in!

137
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:03,843
<i>I must admit, I didn't think much
of Andy, first time I laid eyes on him.</i>

138
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:07,130
<i>Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.</i>

139
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:09,807
<i>That was my first impression of the man.</i>

140
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:11,300
What do you say, Red?

141
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:14,937
That tall drink of water with
the silver spoon up his ass.

142
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:18,399
- That guy? Never happen.
- Ten cigarettes.

143
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,650
That's a rich bet.

144
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,644
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

145
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,113
Heywood? Jigger?

146
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:25,356
Skeet?

147
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:27,150
Floyd?

148
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:30,161
Four brave souls.

149
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:33,080
<i>Return to your cell
blocks for evening count.</i>

150
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:36,263
<i>All prisoners return to your cell blocks.</i>

151
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,153
Turn to the right. Eyes front.

152
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:15,289
This is Mr. Hadley. He's
Captain of the Guards.

153
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,341
I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.

154
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,627
You are convicted felons.

155
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:21,945
That's why they've sent you to me.

156
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,056
Rule number one:

157
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:26,017
No blasphemy.

158
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:29,645
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

159
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:31,105
The other rules...

160
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,899
you'll figure out as you go along.

161
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,675
Any questions?

162
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:36,565
When do we eat?

163
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:47,244
You eat when we say you eat!

164
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:50,608
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

165
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:53,169
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

166
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,745
Aarghh!

167
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:56,589
On your feet.

168
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,466
I believe in two things.

169
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,027
Discipline and the Bible.

170
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:03,842
Here you'll receive both.

171
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:06,699
Put your trust in the Lord.

172
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,556
Your ass belongs to me.

173
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:13,727
Welcome to Shawshank.

174
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:20,275
Unhook 'em.

175
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:26,707
Turn around.

176
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:35,070
That's enough.

177
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,106
Move to the end of the cage.

178
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:40,166
Turn around.

179
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,797
Delouse him.

180
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:44,883
Turn around.

181
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,342
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

182
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:52,266
Next man up.

183
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:57,266
To the right. Right, right, right.

184
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:58,893
Left, left...

185
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:02,747
<i>The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.</i>

186
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:06,358
<i>They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,</i>

187
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:10,529
<i>skin burning and half-blind from that
delousing shit they throw on you.</i>

188
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,374
<i>And when they put you in that cell,</i>

189
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:16,127
<i>and those bars slam home...</i>

190
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:18,963
<i>that's when you know it's for real.</i>

191
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:22,283
<i>Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.</i>

192
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:26,967
<i>Nothing left, but all the time
in the world to think about it.</i>

193
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,475
<i>Most new fish come close
to madness the first night.</i>

194
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:35,054
<i>Somebody always breaks down crying.</i>

195
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:37,398
<i>Happens every time.</i>

196
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,567
<i>The only question is:</i>

197
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:41,565
<i>Who's it gonna be?</i>

198
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,235
<i>It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.</i>

199
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,239
<i>I had my money on Andy Dufresne.</i>

200
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:00,204
Lights out!

201
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:23,111
<i>I remember my first night.</i>

202
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:26,576
<i>Seems like a long time ago.</i>

203
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,384
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

204
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:31,770
<i>Hey, fish.</i>

205
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:35,698
<i>Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.</i>

206
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,702
<i>- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?</i>

207
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:42,121
<i>You'll wish your daddy
never dicked your mommy.</i>

208
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:46,208
<i>Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!</i>

209
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:51,338
<i>You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!</i>

210
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:54,800
<i>- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.</i>

211
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:58,220
<i>The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.</i>

212
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:00,747
<i>And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.</i>

213
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,619
Hey, Fat Ass.

214
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,567
<i>Fat Ass.</i>

215
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:10,741
<i>Talk to me, boy.</i>

216
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:13,736
<i>I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.</i>

217
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:16,739
<i>Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?</i>

218
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,707
<i>This place ain't so bad.</i>

219
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:20,614
I tell you what.

220
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:24,955
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

221
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,925
<i>I know a couple of big old bull queers</i>

222
00:17:27,926 --> 00:17:30,669
<i>that would just love to
make your acquaintance.</i>

223
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,173
<i>Especially that big, white,
m-mushy butt of yours.</i>

224
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:35,675
God!

225
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:37,760
I don't belong here!

226
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,261
<i>We have a winner!</i>

227
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:41,096
<i>I wanna go home!</i>

228
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:43,015
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

229
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:46,268
Hey, it's the fat guy!
It's the fat guy!

230
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:50,189
Fresh fish!
Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

231
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,983
<i>I don't belong here!</i>

232
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,276
<i>Fresh fish!</i>

233
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:58,196
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

234
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:01,033
<i>I had your mother.
She wasn't that great.</i>

235
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,368
<i>Fresh fish!</i>

236
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,997
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

237
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:09,792
<i>He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.</i>

238
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,726
You'll be telling him
with my baton up your ass!

239
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,128
<i>You got to let me out of here!</i>

240
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:16,590
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

241
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:17,841
<i>Please...</i>

242
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:19,968
I ain't supposed to be here.

243
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:21,428
Not me!

244
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:24,211
I ain't gonna count to three,
I'm not even gonna count to one.

245
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:26,350
You'll shut the fuck up
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

246
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:28,268
Shut up, man. Shut up.

247
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:29,645
<i>There's been a mistake!</i>

248
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:33,198
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

249
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,066
Open that cell.

250
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:37,917
<i>Me neither. You people run
this place like a fucking prison!</i>

251
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:47,230
Son of a bitch.

252
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,382
<i>Take it easy.</i>

253
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:20,237
If I hear so much as a mouse
fart in here the rest of the night,

254
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:23,991
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

255
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:26,456
<i>Every last motherfucker in here.</i>

256
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:33,747
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

257
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:52,770
<i>His first night in the joint, Andy
Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.</i>

258
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:56,027
<i>He never made a sound.</i>

259
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:16,752
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Tier 2 South. Clear.

260
00:20:16,753 --> 00:20:20,756
- Tier 3 South. Clear.
- Tier 1 North...

261
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:23,634
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

262
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:26,099
Prepare to roll out.

263
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:30,763
Roll out!

264
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,947
Are... Are you going to eat that?

265
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:30,247
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

266
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,540
Do you mind?

267
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:42,509
Ah... that's nice and ripe.

268
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:55,968
Jake says thank you.

269
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:59,167
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

270
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,669
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

271
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,742
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

272
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:14,094
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

273
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,997
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

274
00:22:16,998 --> 00:22:19,499
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

275
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,777
just like a pretty little chorus line.

276
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:24,546
Yeah, look at that!

277
00:22:24,547 --> 00:22:27,907
- Look at that. I can't stand this guy.
- Oh, Lord!

278
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:31,386
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

279
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:34,555
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

280
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:38,977
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

281
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:42,272
But I sure do love that winning
horse of mine, though.

282
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:45,667
I believe, I owe that boy a great big,
sloppy kiss when I see him.

283
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:48,153
Why don't you give him some
of your cigarettes, instead?

284
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:49,730
Lucky fuck.

285
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:51,623
Hey, Tyrell.

286
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:53,768
You pull infirmary duty this week?

287
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:58,205
- How's that horse of mine doing, anyway?
- Dead.

288
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:03,585
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

289
00:23:03,886 --> 00:23:06,421
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

290
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:09,237
By then, hell, there weren't
nothing we could do.

291
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:17,020
What was his name?

292
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:21,649
What did you say?

293
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:25,607
I was just wondering if
anyone knew his name.

294
00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:28,698
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

295
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:33,036
It doesn't fuckin' matter what
his name was. He's dead.

296
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,628
Hey...

297
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:57,161
Anybody come at you yet?

298
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:01,564
Anybody get to you yet?

299
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:05,439
Hey, we all need friends in here.

300
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,437
I could be a friend to you.

301
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:11,666
Hey...

302
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:18,081
Hard to get.

303
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:21,418
I like that.

304
00:24:28,171 --> 00:24:31,548
<i>Andy kept pretty
much to himself at first.</i>

305
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:36,983
<i>I guess he had a lot on his mind,
trying to adapt to life on the inside.</i>

306
00:24:37,847 --> 00:24:40,740
<i>It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth...</i>

307
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:43,314
<i>to say more than two words to somebody.</i>

308
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:48,779
<i>As it turned out...
that somebody was me.</i>

309
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:55,636
<i>Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.</i>

310
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,535
I'm Andy Dufresne.

311
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:02,501
The wife-killing banker.

312
00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:05,749
Why did you do it?

313
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,959
I didn't, since you ask.

314
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,588
You're gonna fit right in!

315
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,541
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

316
00:25:14,142 --> 00:25:17,657
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

317
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:22,975
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

318
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:26,812
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

319
00:25:27,313 --> 00:25:30,231
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

320
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:32,901
I haven't made up my mind.

321
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:35,972
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

322
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:40,159
I'm known to locate certain
things, from time to time.

323
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,245
- I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer. - A what?

324
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:45,205
A rock hammer.

325
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:47,879
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

326
00:25:49,377 --> 00:25:52,437
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I wouldn't
a question, I'd just quote a price,

327
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:55,103
but then a toothbrush is
a non-lethal object, isn't it?

328
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:57,535
Fair enough.

329
00:25:58,136 --> 00:26:00,879
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

330
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,398
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

331
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:05,564
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

332
00:26:07,353 --> 00:26:08,504
Quartz?

333
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:10,953
Quartz.

334
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:14,585
And some mica.

335
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:16,533
Shale.

336
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:18,705
Limestone.

337
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:19,807
So?

338
00:26:20,908 --> 00:26:22,576
So, I'm a rock hound.

339
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:26,471
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

340
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:29,082
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

341
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:30,421
No, sir.

342
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:32,836
I have no enemies here.

343
00:26:32,837 --> 00:26:35,593
No? Wait a while.

344
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:38,109
Word gets around.

345
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,320
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

346
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:44,394
Especially Bogs.

347
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:49,394
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

348
00:26:49,395 --> 00:26:50,979
Neither are they.

349
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,070
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

350
00:26:59,145 --> 00:27:03,075
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

351
00:27:03,576 --> 00:27:06,787
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

352
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:08,705
Thanks for the advice.

353
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:10,073
Well, that's free.

354
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:12,209
You understand my concern.

355
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,037
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer, OK?

356
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:19,929
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

357
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,886
Did I miss something? What's funny?

358
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:25,811
You'll understand when
you see the rock hammer.

359
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:32,521
- What's an item like this usually go for?
- Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

360
00:27:33,022 --> 00:27:35,232
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

361
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,860
But this is a specialty item.

362
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:40,445
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

363
00:27:40,947 --> 00:27:42,989
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

364
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,045
Ten it is.

365
00:27:45,952 --> 00:27:47,753
Waste of money, if you ask me.

366
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:49,376
Why's that?

367
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:54,005
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

368
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:57,288
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

369
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,098
If they do catch you with it,
you don't know me.

370
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:02,892
You mention my name, we
never do business again.

371
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:05,600
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

372
00:28:07,223 --> 00:28:08,223
I understand.

373
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:10,141
Thank you...

374
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:12,251
Mr. er...?

375
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:15,438
- Red. The name's Red.
- Red?

376
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:18,171
Why do they call you that?

377
00:28:21,862 --> 00:28:23,827
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

378
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:35,041
<i>I could see why some of
the boys took him for snobby.</i>

379
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:38,045
<i>He had a quiet way about him.</i>

380
00:28:38,546 --> 00:28:42,691
<i>A walk and a talk, that just
wasn't normal around here.</i>

381
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:44,218
<i>He strolled...</i>

382
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:48,639
<i>like a man in a park, without
a care or worry in the world.</i>

383
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,635
<i>Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.</i>

384
00:28:54,136 --> 00:28:58,106
<i>Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...</i>

385
00:28:58,307 --> 00:29:00,071
<i>I liked Andy from the start.</i>

386
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:05,535
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

387
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,415
Move it! Come on. Move it!

388
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:17,672
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

389
00:29:27,011 --> 00:29:28,353
Easy.

390
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:30,518
Keep it moving.

391
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:35,064
Red...

392
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:59,201
<i>Andy was right.
I finally got the joke.</i>

393
00:29:59,702 --> 00:30:04,385
<i>It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.</i>

394
00:30:08,344 --> 00:30:10,809
- Book?
- Not today.

395
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:18,733
- Book?
- No.

396
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,236
Hey, Brooksy.

397
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:27,617
Delivery for Dufresne.

398
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:40,038
Book?... book?

399
00:30:42,962 --> 00:30:44,371
Dufresne...

400
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:46,520
Here's your book.

401
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,310
Thanks.

402
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:02,627
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

403
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:41,895
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

404
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:45,027
Honey... hush.

405
00:31:57,102 --> 00:31:59,204
That's it. You fight.

406
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:00,872
It's better that way.

407
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:12,233
<i>I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,</i>

408
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,261
<i>and the Sisters let him be.</i>

409
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:16,745
<i>I wish I could tell you that.</i>

410
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:19,312
<i>But prison is no fairy-tale world.</i>

411
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,602
<i>He never said who did it.</i>

412
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:24,931
<i>But we all knew.</i>

413
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:31,945
<i>Things went on like that for a while.</i>

414
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:35,156
<i>Prison life consists of routine...</i>

415
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:37,247
<i>and then more routine.</i>

416
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:43,261
<i>Every so often, Andy would
show up with fresh bruises.</i>

417
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,376
<i>The Sisters kept at him.</i>

418
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:50,489
<i>Sometimes he was able to
fight 'em off. Sometimes not.</i>

419
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,925
<i>And that's how it went for Andy.</i>

420
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:56,553
<i>That was his routine.</i>

421
00:32:57,054 --> 00:33:00,632
<i>I do believe those first two
years were the worst for him.</i>

422
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:02,308
<i>And I also believe,</i>

423
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:06,997
<i>if things had gone on that way, this
place would have got the best of him.</i>

424
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:13,027
<i>But then, in the spring of 1949,
the powers that be decided that...</i>

425
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:16,031
The roof of the license-plate
factory needs resurfacing.

426
00:33:16,732 --> 00:33:19,664
I need a dozen
volunteers for a week's work.

427
00:33:20,452 --> 00:33:21,862
As you know,

428
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:25,957
special detail carries
with it special privileges.

429
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,823
<i>It was outdoor detail...</i>

430
00:33:29,345 --> 00:33:33,415
<i>...and May is one damn fine
month to be working outdoors.</i>

431
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:35,125
Stay in line there.

432
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:38,224
<i>More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.</i>

433
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:45,398
Wallace E Unger.

434
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:48,330
Ellis Redding.

435
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:50,349
<i>Wouldn't you know it?</i>

436
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,119
<i>Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.</i>

437
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,487
<i>Andrew Dufresne.</i>

438
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:59,516
<i>It only cost us a pack
of smokes per man.</i>

439
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:02,910
<i>I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.</i>

440
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:06,481
So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

441
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:07,874
I say, "Yeah?"

442
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:11,970
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

443
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:16,515
- Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

444
00:34:16,616 --> 00:34:18,635
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

445
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:22,680
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

446
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:27,619
- Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks
- A million bucks?

447
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,560
Fucking incredible how
lucky some assholes get.

448
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:32,707
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

449
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:35,977
35,000. That's what he left me.

450
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:37,779
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

451
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,991
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

452
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:42,584
Isn't it?

453
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:45,612
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

454
00:34:45,913 --> 00:34:48,756
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

455
00:34:49,157 --> 00:34:53,110
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

456
00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:54,663
Crying shame.

457
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:56,715
Some people really got it awful!

458
00:34:57,316 --> 00:35:01,068
Andy, are you nuts?
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

459
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:04,097
Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

460
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:07,216
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

461
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:08,977
I've got to pay tax on the car.

462
00:35:09,078 --> 00:35:13,439
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids pestering
me to take them for a ride all the time...

463
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,443
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

464
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:19,396
I tell you... Uncle Sam!

465
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:23,533
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

466
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:26,327
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

467
00:35:26,328 --> 00:35:28,746
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

468
00:35:28,947 --> 00:35:31,916
Some brother! Shit.

469
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:32,839
Hey!

470
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:38,106
Mr. Hadley...

471
00:35:38,507 --> 00:35:40,045
do you trust your wife?

472
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,844
Oh, that's funny.

473
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:46,305
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

474
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:50,147
I mean, do you think she'd go behind
your back, try to hamstring you?

475
00:35:50,853 --> 00:35:54,497
That's it. Step aside, Mert.
This fucker's having an accident.

476
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:55,648
He's gonna push him off the roof.

477
00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:59,161
Cos if you do trust her, there's
no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

478
00:35:59,662 --> 00:36:01,821
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

479
00:36:01,822 --> 00:36:03,931
- 35,000?
- All of it.

480
00:36:03,932 --> 00:36:05,750
- All of it?
- Every penny.

481
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,869
You'd better start making sense.

482
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,288
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

483
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:14,700
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

484
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:18,797
- Bullshit! Tax-free?
- Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

485
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:21,966
You're the smart banker what
killed his wife, aren't you.

486
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,395
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?

487
00:36:24,396 --> 00:36:27,180
- So I can end up in here with you?
- It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS.

488
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:30,375
They'll say the same thing.
Actually I feel stupid telling you this.

489
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:32,452
I'm sure you would have
investigated the on matter yourself.

490
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:36,623
Yeah, I don't need no smart banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

491
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:40,351
Of course not, but you do need
someone to set up the tax-free gift for you.

492
00:36:40,352 --> 00:36:44,130
- It'll cost you. A lawyer, for example.
- A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

493
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:45,030
Alright.

494
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:48,167
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

495
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:52,485
If you get the forms, I'll prepare
them for you. Nearly free of charge.

496
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:57,451
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

497
00:36:57,852 --> 00:37:00,554
Co-workers! Get him!
That's rich, ain't it?

498
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:03,199
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man,...

499
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,559
if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion... sir.

500
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,310
What are you jimmies staring at?
Back to work!

501
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:15,650
Let's go. Work.

502
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:29,843
<i>And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,</i>

503
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:34,997
<i>the convict crew that tarred the
plate-factory roof in the spring of '49...</i>

504
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:38,292
<i>wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,</i>

505
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:42,255
<i>drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...</i>

506
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:47,552
<i>courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.</i>

507
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:50,017
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

508
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:55,564
<i>The colossal prick even
managed to sound magnanimous.</i>

509
00:37:56,937 --> 00:38:01,249
<i>We sat and drank with the sun on
our shoulders, and felt like free men.</i>

510
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,136
<i>Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.</i>

511
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:08,314
<i>We were the lords of all creation.</i>

512
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:13,244
<i>As for Andy, he spent that
break hunkered in the shade...</i>

513
00:38:13,385 --> 00:38:16,038
<i>a strange little smile on his face,</i>

514
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:18,504
<i>watching us drink his beer.</i>

515
00:38:24,882 --> 00:38:25,907
Hey...

516
00:38:26,508 --> 00:38:27,884
Want a cold one, Andy?

517
00:38:28,285 --> 00:38:29,635
No, thanks.

518
00:38:29,636 --> 00:38:31,309
I gave up drinking.

519
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:38,819
<i>You could argue he'd done
it to curry favor with the guards.</i>

520
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,535
<i>Or maybe make a
few friends among us cons.</i>

521
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:47,449
<i>Me, I think he did it
just to feel normal again.</i>

522
00:38:48,155 --> 00:38:50,619
<i>If only for a short while.</i>

523
00:38:53,118 --> 00:38:54,136
King me.

524
00:38:55,737 --> 00:38:58,839
- Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.
- What?

525
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,066
Civilized, strategic.

526
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:03,085
And a total fucking mystery.

527
00:39:03,086 --> 00:39:04,378
I hate it.

528
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,470
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

529
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:08,925
Yeah. Sure.

530
00:39:09,526 --> 00:39:11,435
I thought of getting a board together.

531
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:14,513
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

532
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:18,676
We might do business on a board.
but I want to carve the pieces myself.

533
00:39:18,677 --> 00:39:22,445
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

534
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:25,348
- I think it'll take years.
- Well, years I got.

535
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:27,017
What I don't have are the rocks.

536
00:39:27,018 --> 00:39:29,170
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

537
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:31,210
Pebbles, mostly.

538
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:38,329
Andy, we're getting to be
kinda friends, aren't we?

539
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,677
Yeah, I guess.

540
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:42,526
Can I ask you something?

541
00:39:44,527 --> 00:39:45,808
Why did you do it?

542
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:50,796
I'm innocent, Red. Just
like everybody else here.

543
00:39:55,213 --> 00:39:56,578
What are you in for?

544
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:01,686
Murder. Same as you.

545
00:40:01,787 --> 00:40:02,933
Innocent?

546
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:07,888
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

547
00:41:07,085 --> 00:41:08,353
<i>Where's the canary?</i>

548
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:10,087
<i>How did you know?</i>

549
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:11,338
<i>How did I know what?</i>

550
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:14,138
<i>So, you don't know? Come.</i>

551
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:18,721
<i>This is where the canary is, Johnny.</i>

552
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:24,499
<i>Quite a surprise to hear a woman
singing in my house, eh, Johnny?</i>

553
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:29,899
<i>That's quite a...</i>

554
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,448
<i>surprise.</i>

555
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:35,863
Red...

556
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:37,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

557
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:40,159
Here she comes.

558
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,220
This is the part I like... when
she does that shit with her hair.

559
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:45,623
Yeah, I know. I've seen
it three times this month.

560
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:48,209
<i>Gilda, are you decent?</i>

561
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,236
<i>Me?</i>

562
00:41:51,963 --> 00:41:56,555
Hah! God, I love it!

563
00:41:59,888 --> 00:42:02,566
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

564
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:07,728
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

565
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,814
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

566
00:42:10,715 --> 00:42:11,829
Can you get her?

567
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:17,279
<i>So, this is Johnny Farrell. I've heard
a lot about you, Johnny Farrell.</i>

568
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,949
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

569
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,387
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed
down the front of my pants right now,...

570
00:42:23,388 --> 00:42:24,294
I'm sorry to say.

571
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:28,170
But I'll get her. Relax.

572
00:42:30,043 --> 00:42:31,327
Thanks.

573
00:42:31,328 --> 00:42:33,712
<i>- It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell.
- It certainly was.</i>

574
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:36,841
<i>- Sit down.
- Did you tell him what I'm doing here?</i>

575
00:42:36,842 --> 00:42:39,760
<i>No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.</i>

576
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:41,808
<i>Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...</i>

577
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:52,958
Take a walk.

578
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:55,823
- I gotta change the reel.
- I said fuck off!

579
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:03,956
Ain't you gonna scream?

580
00:43:04,953 --> 00:43:06,725
Let's get this over with.

581
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:13,381
He broke my fuckin' nose!

582
00:43:23,013 --> 00:43:26,741
Now... I'm gonna open my fly...

583
00:43:27,142 --> 00:43:30,482
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

584
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:33,463
When you're gonna swallow mein
then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

585
00:43:33,464 --> 00:43:36,383
You broke his nose, he ought
to have something to show for it.

586
00:43:36,384 --> 00:43:38,577
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

587
00:43:38,578 --> 00:43:41,113
No. You don't understand.

588
00:43:41,514 --> 00:43:44,608
You do that, and I'll put all eight
inches of this steel in your ear.

589
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:45,576
All right.

590
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:48,731
But you should know that sudden,
serious brain injury causes...

591
00:43:48,732 --> 00:43:50,986
...the victim to bite down hard.

592
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,959
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

593
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,136
they have to pry the victim's
jaws open... with a crowbar.

594
00:44:01,593 --> 00:44:03,102
Where did you get this shit?

595
00:44:03,603 --> 00:44:04,750
I read it.

596
00:44:06,056 --> 00:44:09,313
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

597
00:44:10,435 --> 00:44:11,891
Honey...

598
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:15,323
...you shouldn't.

599
00:44:17,984 --> 00:44:21,070
<i>Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth...</i>

600
00:44:21,071 --> 00:44:23,130
<i>and neither did his friends.</i>

601
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:27,205
<i>What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.</i>

602
00:44:28,036 --> 00:44:30,417
<i>Andy spent a month in the infirmary.</i>

603
00:44:31,281 --> 00:44:33,962
<i>Bogs spent a week in the hole.</i>

604
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:39,752
Time's up, Bogs.

605
00:44:43,343 --> 00:44:45,307
It's your world, boss.

606
00:44:48,414 --> 00:44:51,016
Return to your cell
blocks for evening count.

607
00:44:51,017 --> 00:44:53,565
All prisoners report for lockdown.

608
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:10,415
What?

609
00:45:22,707 --> 00:45:25,597
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

610
00:45:26,803 --> 00:45:29,388
No! No!

611
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:30,848
No!

612
00:45:31,149 --> 00:45:32,266
Help... me...

613
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:33,642
Aaarghh!

614
00:45:35,854 --> 00:45:38,605
<i>Two things never
happened again after that.</i>

615
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,622
<i>The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again...</i>

616
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:45,342
<i>...and Bogs never walked again.</i>

617
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:49,992
<i>They transferred him to
a minimum-security hospital upstate.</i>

618
00:45:49,993 --> 00:45:54,689
<i>To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of
his days drinking his food through a straw.</i>

619
00:45:55,790 --> 00:46:00,341
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

620
00:46:01,588 --> 00:46:05,762
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

621
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,911
The man likes to play chess.

622
00:46:09,512 --> 00:46:11,677
Let's get him some rocks.

623
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:45,264
Guys...

624
00:46:45,965 --> 00:46:48,722
I got one. I got one. Look.

625
00:46:50,762 --> 00:46:52,930
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

626
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:55,124
And it ain't alabaster, either.

627
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:58,961
- What are you, a fucking geologist?
- He's right. It ain't.

628
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:02,023
- Well, what the hell is it?
- A horse apple.

629
00:47:03,024 --> 00:47:06,435
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

630
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:15,494
Oh, Jesus Christ!

631
00:47:15,495 --> 00:47:17,238
Oh, damn!

632
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:21,680
<i>Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.</i>

633
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:27,949
<i>And by the weekend he was due back, we had
enough rocks to keep him busy till rapture.</i>

634
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,143
<i>I also got a big shipment in that week.</i>

635
00:47:31,544 --> 00:47:33,971
<i>Cigarettes. Chewing gum.</i>

636
00:47:34,182 --> 00:47:35,356
<i>Sipping whiskey.</i>

637
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:39,184
<i>Playing cards with naked
ladies on them. You name it.</i>

638
00:47:39,585 --> 00:47:42,526
<i>And of course, the most important item.</i>

639
00:47:43,898 --> 00:47:46,263
<i>Rita Hayworth herself.</i>

640
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:23,061
OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

641
00:48:23,062 --> 00:48:25,481
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

642
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:28,113
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

643
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:31,317
119.

644
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:34,487
123.

645
00:48:45,585 --> 00:48:46,731
On your feet.

646
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:49,918
Face the wall.

647
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:26,396
Turn around and face the Warden.

648
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:34,796
Pleased to see you reading this.

649
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:37,866
Any favorite passages?

650
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:44,439
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

651
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:47,363
Mark 13:35.

652
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:49,816
I always liked that one.

653
00:49:50,817 --> 00:49:52,401
But I prefer...

654
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:54,737
"I'm the light of the world.

655
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:59,015
He that followeth me shall not walk in
darkness, but shall have the light of life."

656
00:49:59,016 --> 00:50:01,135
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

657
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:05,177
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

658
00:50:06,124 --> 00:50:08,188
A man should have a skill.

659
00:50:10,695 --> 00:50:12,133
Wanna explain this?

660
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:16,380
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

661
00:50:17,343 --> 00:50:19,483
A little hobby of mine.

662
00:50:30,148 --> 00:50:34,999
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

663
00:50:39,357 --> 00:50:41,021
I can't say I approve of this.

664
00:50:42,744 --> 00:50:44,633
But I suppose...

665
00:50:46,414 --> 00:50:48,670
...exceptions can be made.

666
00:50:58,876 --> 00:51:00,349
Lock 'em up!

667
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:04,315
I almost forgot.

668
00:51:05,016 --> 00:51:06,751
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

669
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:09,690
Salvation lies within.

670
00:51:09,996 --> 00:51:11,409
Yes, sir.

671
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,295
<i>Tossing cells was just an excuse.</i>

672
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:26,624
<i>The truth is,
Norton wanted to size Andy up.</i>

673
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:42,491
My wife made that in church group.

674
00:51:45,348 --> 00:51:46,862
Very nice, sir.

675
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,106
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

676
00:51:51,354 --> 00:51:53,146
No, sir, not especially.

677
00:51:53,547 --> 00:51:55,524
Perhaps we can find something more...

678
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:58,490
befitting a man of your education.

679
00:52:06,452 --> 00:52:08,203
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

680
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:09,579
Andy.

681
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,253
I thought I heard you out here!

682
00:52:13,376 --> 00:52:15,043
I've been reassigned to you.

683
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:18,296
I know. They told me.

684
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:20,165
Ain't that a kick in the head?

685
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:22,951
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

686
00:52:23,152 --> 00:52:23,920
Come on.

687
00:52:25,621 --> 00:52:27,272
Well, here she is.

688
00:52:27,473 --> 00:52:29,500
Shawshank Prison library.

689
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:32,161
National Geographics.

690
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:35,981
Reader's Digest condensed books.

691
00:52:36,232 --> 00:52:37,875
Louis L'Amour.

692
00:52:38,276 --> 00:52:40,085
Look Magazine.

693
00:52:40,486 --> 00:52:42,671
Erle Stanley Gardners.

694
00:52:43,072 --> 00:52:46,216
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

695
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:49,370
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

696
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:56,460
- Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?
- Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

697
00:52:56,861 --> 00:53:02,215
Oh... I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

698
00:53:03,116 --> 00:53:05,377
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

699
00:53:05,378 --> 00:53:08,145
No. No, not much to it, really.

700
00:53:08,747 --> 00:53:11,333
- Well, why me? Why now?
- I don't know,

701
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:14,970
but it'll be nice to have some
company down here for a change.

702
00:53:14,971 --> 00:53:16,535
Dufresne!

703
00:53:26,157 --> 00:53:28,221
That's him. That's the one.

704
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:37,167
I'm Dekins.

705
00:53:37,568 --> 00:53:39,311
I was er...

706
00:53:39,712 --> 00:53:44,095
thinking about maybe setting up some
kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

707
00:53:46,052 --> 00:53:47,294
Oh...

708
00:53:47,595 --> 00:53:49,142
I see.

709
00:53:50,923 --> 00:53:52,279
Well, erm...

710
00:53:53,976 --> 00:53:57,067
...why don't we have a seat, and talk it over?

711
00:54:00,033 --> 00:54:03,131
Brooks, do you have
a piece of paper and a pencil?

712
00:54:14,522 --> 00:54:15,714
Thanks.

713
00:54:16,615 --> 00:54:18,063
So...

714
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:21,020
Mr. Dekins...

715
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:26,466
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

716
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:28,677
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

717
00:54:28,678 --> 00:54:31,429
As God is my witness, he did!

718
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,091
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

719
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:37,352
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

720
00:54:37,353 --> 00:54:38,311
My ass!

721
00:54:38,312 --> 00:54:39,604
Shook his hand.

722
00:54:39,605 --> 00:54:43,149
Hell, I... I near soiled myself!

723
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,445
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

724
00:54:47,446 --> 00:54:49,990
and he would have been:
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

725
00:54:49,991 --> 00:54:52,121
Making a few friends, Andy?

726
00:54:52,785 --> 00:54:54,828
I wouldn't say "friends".

727
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:58,715
I'm a convicted murderer who
provides sound financial planning.

728
00:54:58,716 --> 00:55:00,834
It's a wonderful pet to have.

729
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:05,630
- Got you out of the laundry, though.
- Well, it might do more than that.

730
00:55:05,831 --> 00:55:08,717
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

731
00:55:08,718 --> 00:55:11,511
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

732
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:14,955
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

733
00:55:14,956 --> 00:55:19,394
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

734
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:21,229
Ask the Warden for funds.

735
00:55:22,565 --> 00:55:26,342
Son, son, son. Six wardens have
been through here in my tenure,

736
00:55:26,343 --> 00:55:29,054
and I've learned one
immutable, universal truth.

737
00:55:29,355 --> 00:55:30,964
Not one of them born...

738
00:55:31,365 --> 00:55:33,907
whose asshole wouldn't pucker
up tighter than a snare...

739
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:35,511
...drum when you asked them for funds.

740
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:39,623
- The budget's stretched thin, as it is.
- I see.

741
00:55:40,124 --> 00:55:43,752
Perhaps I could write to the State
Senate and request funds from them.

742
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:45,835
As far as they're concerned,
there's only three ways to spend...

743
00:55:45,836 --> 00:55:48,014
...tax paying hard than money
when it comes to prisons.

744
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:50,483
more walls, more bars and more guards.

745
00:55:50,484 --> 00:55:55,188
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. A
letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

746
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:56,014
Sure can.

747
00:55:56,715 --> 00:55:58,976
But you write your letters,
if it makes you happy.

748
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:02,150
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

749
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:08,582
<i>So, Andy started writing
a letter a week,... just like he said.</i>

750
00:56:12,949 --> 00:56:17,457
<i>And, just like Norton said,
Andy got no answers.</i>

751
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:30,007
<i>The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.</i>

752
00:56:31,508 --> 00:56:33,677
<i>The year after that, he did them all...</i>

753
00:56:33,678 --> 00:56:35,642
<i>including the Warden's.</i>

754
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,976
<i>The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season</i>

755
00:56:40,977 --> 00:56:43,441
<i>to coincide with tax season.</i>

756
00:56:45,356 --> 00:56:49,651
<i>The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.</i>

757
00:56:49,652 --> 00:56:53,963
So, Moresby Prison issued you
your gun, but you had to pay for it?

758
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:55,699
Damn right. The holster, too.

759
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,284
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.

760
00:56:58,285 --> 00:57:01,705
<i>Yes, sir. Andy was a
regular cottage industry.</i>

761
00:57:02,206 --> 00:57:04,833
<i>In fact, it got so busy at tax time...</i>

762
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:06,760
<i>he was allowed a staff.</i>

763
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:09,504
Hey, Red, can you
hand me a stack of 1040s?

764
00:57:09,705 --> 00:57:12,257
<i>It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,</i>

765
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:14,410
<i>and that was fine by me.</i>

766
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:18,768
<i>And still... he kept
sending those letters.</i>

767
00:57:23,686 --> 00:57:25,603
Red... Andy.

768
00:57:25,604 --> 00:57:26,896
It's Brooks.

769
00:57:26,897 --> 00:57:28,941
Watch the door.

770
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:32,509
- Please, Brooks.
- Just calm the fuck down.

771
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,194
Stay back!

772
00:57:33,595 --> 00:57:35,421
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

773
00:57:35,422 --> 00:57:38,491
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

774
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:41,036
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

775
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:43,246
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

776
00:57:43,247 --> 00:57:45,040
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

777
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:47,000
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

778
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:48,610
It's what they done!

779
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:50,912
I... I got no choice...

780
00:57:50,913 --> 00:57:53,865
You're not gonna hurt Heywood.
we all know even Heywood knows that.

781
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:56,076
- Right, Heywood?
- I... I know that, sure.

782
00:57:56,077 --> 00:57:59,779
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend of
yours and Brooks has been a reasonable man.

783
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,056
That's right. That's right, guys?

784
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:04,717
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

785
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:06,432
Put the knife down.

786
00:58:07,438 --> 00:58:08,388
Brooks...

787
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,624
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

788
00:58:11,925 --> 00:58:13,443
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

789
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:15,862
It's the only...

790
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:18,740
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

791
00:58:18,741 --> 00:58:21,326
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this, come on.

792
00:58:21,727 --> 00:58:23,291
Put it down.

793
00:58:30,995 --> 00:58:35,590
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

794
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:36,850
Him?

795
00:58:37,151 --> 00:58:41,204
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

796
00:58:41,205 --> 00:58:43,515
Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

797
00:58:43,816 --> 00:58:45,450
What the hell did you
do to set him off, anyway?

798
00:58:45,451 --> 00:58:48,269
I do nothing. I come in
here to say fare-thee-well.

799
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,277
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

800
00:58:53,842 --> 00:58:56,553
I just don't understand what
happened in there. That's all.

801
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:59,522
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

802
00:58:59,523 --> 00:59:01,616
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

803
00:59:02,017 --> 00:59:04,802
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

804
00:59:04,803 --> 00:59:06,162
Would you knock it off?

805
00:59:07,063 --> 00:59:08,581
Brooks ain't no bug.

806
00:59:09,082 --> 00:59:10,038
He's just...

807
00:59:12,336 --> 00:59:14,550
He's just institutionalized.

808
00:59:15,506 --> 00:59:17,757
Institutionalized, my ass.

809
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:21,636
The man's been in here
50 years, Heywood. 50 years.

810
00:59:21,637 --> 00:59:23,129
This is all he knows.

811
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,932
In here, he's an important man.

812
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:27,475
He's an educated man.

813
00:59:28,276 --> 00:59:29,941
Outside, he's nothing.

814
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:33,940
Just a used-up con with
arthritis in both hands.

815
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:37,235
Probably couldn't get
a library card if he tried.

816
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:39,404
You know what I'm trying to say?

817
00:59:40,105 --> 00:59:42,837
Red, I do believe you're
talking out of your ass.

818
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:46,328
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

819
00:59:47,029 --> 00:59:49,252
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

820
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:52,556
First you hate 'em...

821
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,384
...then you get used to 'em.

822
00:59:58,332 --> 01:00:00,342
Enough time passes...

823
01:00:01,043 --> 01:00:03,187
you get so you depend on 'em.

824
01:00:03,988 --> 01:00:06,106
That's institutionalized.

825
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:07,682
Shit.

826
01:00:07,683 --> 01:00:09,392
You can never get like that.

827
01:00:09,393 --> 01:00:10,894
Oh, yeah?

828
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:14,063
Say that when you've been
here as long as Brooks has.

829
01:00:14,364 --> 01:00:15,820
Goddamn right.

830
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:20,204
They send you here for life.

831
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:23,369
That's exactly what they take.

832
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:26,873
The part that counts, anyway.

833
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:37,249
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

834
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:40,303
You go on, now.

835
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:43,059
You're free.

836
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:45,559
You're free.

837
01:01:02,471 --> 01:01:03,827
Bye.

838
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:06,830
Good luck, Brooks.

839
01:01:44,929 --> 01:01:46,322
<i>Dear fellas...</i>

840
01:01:46,823 --> 01:01:50,818
<i>I can't believe how fast
things move on the outside.</i>

841
01:01:52,354 --> 01:01:54,681
<i>Watch it, old-timer! Are
you trying to get killed?</i>

842
01:01:55,982 --> 01:01:59,501
<i>I saw an automobile once,
when I was a kid, but...</i>

843
01:02:00,102 --> 01:02:02,301
<i>now... they're everywhere.</i>

844
01:02:06,034 --> 01:02:09,900
<i>The world went and got
itself in a big damn hurry.</i>

845
01:02:26,571 --> 01:02:32,351
<i>The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,</i>

846
01:02:32,352 --> 01:02:36,327
<i>and a job, bagging groceries at the Foodway.</i>

847
01:02:37,991 --> 01:02:43,412
<i>It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.</i>

848
01:02:43,413 --> 01:02:45,398
Make sure your man double-bags.

849
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:48,433
Last time, he didn't double-bags.
The bottom near came out.

850
01:02:48,434 --> 01:02:51,512
Make sure you double-bag,
like the lady says. Understand?

851
01:02:51,513 --> 01:02:52,855
Yes, sir. I surely will.

852
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:56,434
<i>I don't think the store
manager likes me very much.</i>

853
01:02:59,713 --> 01:03:04,192
<i>Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.</i>

854
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:09,614
<i>I keep thinking... Jake might
just show up and say hello.</i>

855
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:11,787
<i>But he never does.</i>

856
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:18,252
<i>I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.</i>

857
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:24,379
<i>I have trouble sleeping at night.</i>

858
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,553
<i>I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.</i>

859
01:03:28,558 --> 01:03:30,559
<i>I wake up, scared.</i>

860
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,743
<i>Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.</i>

861
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:41,836
<i>Maybe I should get me a gun and rob
the Foodway, so they'd send me home.</i>

862
01:03:41,897 --> 01:03:44,115
<i>I could shoot the
manager, while I was at it.</i>

863
01:03:44,316 --> 01:03:46,155
<i>Sort of like a bonus.</i>

864
01:03:47,677 --> 01:03:51,614
<i>I guess I'm too old for that
sort of nonsense any more.</i>

865
01:03:52,115 --> 01:03:53,741
<i>I don't like it here.</i>

866
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:56,494
<i>I'm tired of being afraid all the time.</i>

867
01:03:56,895 --> 01:03:57,962
<i>I've decided...</i>

868
01:03:58,563 --> 01:03:59,919
<i>not to stay.</i>

869
01:04:11,084 --> 01:04:17,036
<i>I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.</i>

870
01:05:20,178 --> 01:05:24,203
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

871
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:29,136
PS. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

872
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:31,002
No hard feelings. Brooks."

873
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:43,606
He should have died in here.

874
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:53,191
What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

875
01:05:59,225 --> 01:06:00,125
What's all this?

876
01:06:00,126 --> 01:06:02,688
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

877
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:05,561
Take it.

878
01:06:14,049 --> 01:06:15,813
"Dear Mr. Dufresne...

879
01:06:16,718 --> 01:06:19,103
In response to your repeated inquiries,

880
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:23,099
the State has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

881
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,356
This is 200 dollars.

882
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:29,722
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

883
01:06:29,723 --> 01:06:32,817
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

884
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:34,986
We trust this will fill your needs.

885
01:06:35,387 --> 01:06:39,398
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

886
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,318
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

887
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:43,166
Yes, sir.

888
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:49,296
Good for you, Andy.

889
01:06:51,945 --> 01:06:52,884
Wow!

890
01:06:54,289 --> 01:06:56,053
It only took six years.

891
01:06:57,867 --> 01:07:00,578
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week, instead of one.

892
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:04,156
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out here,

893
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:05,208
like the Captain said.

894
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:10,366
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

895
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,741
Wow.

896
01:07:51,605 --> 01:07:54,570
<i>♪ Sull'aria... ♪</i>

897
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:00,121

01:08:00,322 --> 01:08:04,413
<i>♪ ...zeffiretto ♪</i>

899
01:08:16,254 --> 01:08:24,475

<i>Dufresne?</i>

904
01:09:11,317 --> 01:09:12,085
<i>Dufresne?</i>

905
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:14,450
<i>Andy, let me out.</i>

906
01:09:17,582 --> 01:09:18,710
<i>Andy?</i>

907
01:09:21,311 --> 01:09:26,065
<i>I have no idea to this day what
those two Italian ladies were singing about.</i>

908
01:09:26,766 --> 01:09:29,068
<i>The truth is, I don't want to know.</i>

909
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:31,533
<i>Some things are best left unsaid.</i>

910
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,901
<i>I like to think they were singing
about something so beautiful,...</i>

911
01:09:37,902 --> 01:09:43,086
<i>...it can't be expressed in words,... and
makes your heart ache because of it.</i>

912
01:09:44,918 --> 01:09:47,611
<i>I tell you, those voices soared...</i>

913
01:09:47,612 --> 01:09:51,941
<i>higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.</i>

914
01:09:52,342 --> 01:09:55,783
<i>It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage</i>

915
01:09:55,784 --> 01:09:58,314
<i>and made those walls dissolve away.</i>

916
01:09:59,015 --> 01:10:00,733
<i>And for the briefest of moments...</i>

917
01:10:01,334 --> 01:10:04,500
<i>every last man at Shawshank felt free.</i>

918
01:10:07,223 --> 01:10:09,705
<i>It pissed the Warden off something awful.</i>

919
01:10:11,144 --> 01:10:12,449
Open the door.

920
01:10:14,723 --> 01:10:16,420
Open it up!

921
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:20,411
Dufresne, open this door!

922
01:10:21,955 --> 01:10:23,372
Turn that off!

923
01:10:30,288 --> 01:10:33,420
I am warning you,
Dufresne. Turn that off!

924
01:10:46,688 --> 01:10:48,044
Dufresne...

925
01:10:50,491 --> 01:10:51,955
<i>You're mine now.</i>

926
01:10:59,425 --> 01:11:02,461
<i>Andy got two weeks in
the hole for that little stunt.</i>

927
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:04,260
On your feet!

928
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,855
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

929
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:13,605
Y-Y-You couldn't play something good, huh?
Hank Williams or something?

930
01:11:13,606 --> 01:11:16,358
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

931
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:18,235
Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?

932
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:19,570
Easiest time I ever did.

933
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:22,614
Bullshit! There's no such
thing as easy time in the hole.

934
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:24,825
A week in the hole is like a year.

935
01:11:25,326 --> 01:11:27,620
I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

936
01:11:28,121 --> 01:11:30,536
So, they let you tote that
record player down there, huh?

937
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:34,794
It was in here.

938
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:36,842
And in here.

939
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:42,306
That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

940
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:48,229
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

941
01:11:50,518 --> 01:11:53,288
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

942
01:11:54,689 --> 01:11:56,065
Lost interest in it, though.

943
01:11:56,566 --> 01:11:57,983
Didn't make much sense in here.

944
01:11:58,484 --> 01:12:00,128
Here's where it makes the most sense.

945
01:12:01,029 --> 01:12:02,997
You need it, so you don't forget.

946
01:12:03,698 --> 01:12:04,615
Forget?

947
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:06,659
Forget that...

948
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,124
there are places...

949
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:14,434
...in the world that aren't made
out of stone... that there's a...

950
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:16,752
there's something...

951
01:12:17,153 --> 01:12:20,430
inside that,... they can't get to... that...

952
01:12:20,771 --> 01:12:22,107
they can't touch.

953
01:12:22,908 --> 01:12:24,264
It's yours.

954
01:12:25,703 --> 01:12:26,892
What are you talking about?

955
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,765
Hope.

956
01:12:30,566 --> 01:12:31,622
Hope?

957
01:12:33,978 --> 01:12:35,530
Let me tell you something, my friend.

958
01:12:36,581 --> 01:12:38,570
Hope is a dangerous thing.

959
01:12:40,076 --> 01:12:42,199
Hope can drive a man insane.

960
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:44,864
It's got no use on the inside.

961
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:47,513
You'd better get used to that idea.

962
01:12:50,253 --> 01:12:51,959
Like Brooks did?

963
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:18,235
Sit down.

964
01:13:23,569 --> 01:13:26,614
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

965
01:13:28,015 --> 01:13:29,825
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

966
01:13:30,326 --> 01:13:31,410
Oh, yes, sir.

967
01:13:32,811 --> 01:13:33,876
Without a doubt.

968
01:13:35,139 --> 01:13:37,254
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

969
01:13:39,761 --> 01:13:41,587
No danger to society here.

970
01:13:42,188 --> 01:13:43,652
God's honest truth.

971
01:13:46,409 --> 01:13:48,173
Absolutely rehabilitated.

972
01:13:58,321 --> 01:13:59,585
30 years.

973
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:03,317
Jesus, when they say it like that...

974
01:14:04,518 --> 01:14:05,782
You wonder where it went.

975
01:14:08,665 --> 01:14:10,329
I wonder where ten years went.

976
01:14:15,797 --> 01:14:16,872
Here.

977
01:14:17,373 --> 01:14:19,421
Little parole rejection present.

978
01:14:21,377 --> 01:14:22,603
Go ahead and open it.

979
01:14:24,404 --> 01:14:27,382
I had to go through one of your
competitors. I hope you don't mind.

980
01:14:27,383 --> 01:14:28,848
I wanted it to be a surprise.

981
01:14:39,604 --> 01:14:40,968
It's very pretty, Andy.

982
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:43,938
Thank you.

983
01:14:46,411 --> 01:14:47,775
Are you going to play it?

984
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:53,690
No.

985
01:14:57,105 --> 01:14:58,669
Not right now.

986
01:15:06,547 --> 01:15:08,512
<i>Tier 3 South. Clear.</i>

987
01:15:09,675 --> 01:15:11,302

01:15:16,724 --> 01:15:17,589
<i>Fall in!</i>

990
01:15:53,686 --> 01:15:54,553
<i>Lights out!</i>

991
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:31,507
<i>Andy was as good as his word.</i>

992
01:16:32,108 --> 01:16:34,489
<i>He wrote two letters
a week instead of one.</i>

993
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:40,949
<i>In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact</i>

994
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:44,111
<i>they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.</i>

995
01:16:44,512 --> 01:16:50,984
<i>Appropriations Committee voted an
annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.</i>

996
01:16:51,185 --> 01:16:54,029
<i>And you'd be amazed how
far Andy could stretch it.</i>

997
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:57,491
<i>He made deals with book
clubs, charity groups.</i>

998
01:16:57,492 --> 01:16:59,951
<i>He bought remaindered
books by the pound.</i>

999
01:17:00,952 --> 01:17:02,245
Treasure Island.

1000
01:17:02,646 --> 01:17:04,398
Robert Louis...

1001
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:05,290
...Stevenson.

1002
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:07,430
Fiction, adventure.

1003
01:17:09,453 --> 01:17:10,579
What's next?

1004
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,770
I got here Auto Repair and...

1005
01:17:14,634 --> 01:17:15,851
...Soap Carving.

1006
01:17:16,052 --> 01:17:19,513
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

Dumb-ass?

1012
01:17:35,363 --> 01:17:37,681
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1013
01:17:38,082 --> 01:17:38,741
Uh-uh.

1014
01:17:39,642 --> 01:17:41,835
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1015
01:17:42,036 --> 01:17:45,422
We ought to file that under
Educational, too, oughtn't we?

1016
01:17:46,823 --> 01:17:50,473
<i>The rest of us did our best to

smelling of rat turds and turpentine</i>

1019
01:17:58,102 --> 01:18:01,221
<i>into the best prison
library in New England,</i>

1020
01:18:01,822 --> 01:18:05,083
<i>complete with a fine
selection of Hank Williams.</i>

1021
01:18:05,484 --> 01:18:08,937
<i>♪ Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo ♪</i>

1022
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:12,074
<i>♪ All I do is sit and sigh... ♪</i>

1023
01:18:12,475 --> 01:18:17,312
<i>That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.</i>

1024
01:18:17,813 --> 01:18:19,906
<i>You may remember reading about it.</i>

1025
01:18:20,307 --> 01:18:23,210
<i>It made all the papers and got
his picture in Look Magazine.</i>

1026
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:24,661
No free ride.

1027
01:18:25,162 --> 01:18:30,555
But rather a genuine, progressive advance,
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1028
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:33,737
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1029
01:18:34,138 --> 01:18:36,573
will be put to work outside these walls,

1030
01:18:36,974 --> 01:18:39,142
performing all manner of public service.

1031
01:18:39,743 --> 01:18:42,846
These men can learn the
value of an honest day's labor,

1032
01:18:43,047 --> 01:18:46,600
while providing a valuable
service to the community and...

1033
01:18:47,101 --> 01:18:51,896
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

1034
01:18:51,897 --> 01:18:54,649
<i>Of course, Norton failed
to mention to the press</i>

1035
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:58,028
<i>that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.</i>

1036
01:18:58,729 --> 01:19:01,281
<i>There are a hundred different
ways to skim off the top.</i>

1037
01:19:01,282 --> 01:19:03,788
<i>Men, materials, you name it.</i>

1038
01:19:04,952 --> 01:19:07,787
<i>And, oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in.</i>

1039
01:19:07,788 --> 01:19:09,998
If this keeps up, you'll
put me out of business.

1040
01:19:09,999 --> 01:19:12,250
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1041
01:19:12,251 --> 01:19:14,377
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1042
01:19:14,378 --> 01:19:18,423
Ned,... we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1043
01:19:18,424 --> 01:19:21,844
Well, that's fine for the papers
but I've got a family to feed.

1044
01:19:22,345 --> 01:19:22,937
Sam...

1045
01:19:24,938 --> 01:19:26,681
Sam, we go back a long way.

1046
01:19:27,782 --> 01:19:32,121
I need this new highway contract.
I don't get it, and I go under. That's a fact.

1047
01:19:33,522 --> 01:19:37,217
You just have some of this fine pie
my missus made especially for you,

1048
01:19:37,818 --> 01:19:39,332
and you think about that.

1049
01:19:47,203 --> 01:19:49,705
Ned, I wouldn't worry too
much about this contract.

1050
01:19:50,206 --> 01:19:53,296
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1051
01:19:55,294 --> 01:19:57,959
You be sure and thank
Maisie for this fine pie.

1052
01:19:59,507 --> 01:20:01,558
<i>And behind every shady deal,</i>

1053
01:20:01,859 --> 01:20:04,052
<i>behind every dollar earned,</i>

1054
01:20:04,853 --> 01:20:07,402
<i>there was Andy,
keeping the books.</i>

1055
01:20:08,265 --> 01:20:11,768
Two deposits. Maine National
and New England First.

1056
01:20:11,769 --> 01:20:13,433
Night drops as always, sir.

1057
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:45,594
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1058
01:20:46,095 --> 01:20:48,072
Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1059
01:20:48,073 --> 01:20:48,872
Yes, sir.

1060
01:20:48,973 --> 01:20:51,909
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts
again, they'll hear about it from me.

1061
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:52,809
Yes, sir.

1062
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:53,994
How do I look?

1063
01:20:54,895 --> 01:20:57,689
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1064
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,079
The Governor's going to be there.

1065
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:01,944
Want the rest of this?

1066
01:21:03,245 --> 01:21:05,109
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1067
01:21:06,407 --> 01:21:07,779
Thank you, sir.

1068
01:21:10,569 --> 01:21:14,305
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1069
01:21:14,306 --> 01:21:16,650
He's got scams you
haven't even dreamed of.

1070
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:18,777
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1071
01:21:18,878 --> 01:21:21,838
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1072
01:21:21,839 --> 01:21:24,875
But the problem with having all that
money is you'll have to explain...

1073
01:21:24,876 --> 01:21:27,344
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1074
01:21:28,045 --> 01:21:30,430
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1075
01:21:30,431 --> 01:21:33,157
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1076
01:21:33,858 --> 01:21:35,910
I send that money out into the real world.

1077
01:21:36,011 --> 01:21:39,522
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1078
01:21:39,523 --> 01:21:40,315
Cleaner.

1079
01:21:40,816 --> 01:21:44,324
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1080
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:51,201
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1081
01:21:51,702 --> 01:21:54,738
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1082
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:57,916
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1083
01:21:58,317 --> 01:22:02,503
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1084
01:22:03,004 --> 01:22:06,166
- it's gonna lead to somebody.
- Sure it is. But not to me.

1085
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,948
And certainly not to the Warden.

1086
01:22:12,515 --> 01:22:13,730
All right. Who?

1087
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:15,183
Randall Stevens.

1088
01:22:15,884 --> 01:22:16,731
Who?

1089
01:22:17,137 --> 01:22:22,232
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1090
01:22:22,733 --> 01:22:24,684
That's where the filtering process starts.

1091
01:22:24,785 --> 01:22:27,438
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1092
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:29,406
But who is he?

1093
01:22:29,707 --> 01:22:31,833
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1094
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:34,077
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1095
01:22:34,978 --> 01:22:37,656
I conjured him... out of thin air.

1096
01:22:38,457 --> 01:22:41,472
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1097
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:46,881
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

1098
01:22:46,882 --> 01:22:50,093
Sure you can, if you know how the
system works, where the cracks are.

1099
01:22:50,494 --> 01:22:53,180
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1100
01:22:53,481 --> 01:22:58,810
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,
a driver's license, social security number.

1101
01:22:59,111 --> 01:23:00,003
You're shitting me?

1102
01:23:00,004 --> 01:23:01,946
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1103
01:23:01,947 --> 01:23:04,608
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1104
01:23:05,109 --> 01:23:07,073
Well, I'll be damned.

1105
01:23:08,787 --> 01:23:10,313
Did I say you were good?

1106
01:23:10,914 --> 01:23:12,566
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1107
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:14,793
You know, the funny thing is,

1108
01:23:14,994 --> 01:23:18,835
on the outside, I was an honest
man, straight as an arrow.

1109
01:23:19,799 --> 01:23:22,255
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1110
01:23:31,135 --> 01:23:32,570
Ever bother you?

1111
01:23:33,554 --> 01:23:36,956
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1112
01:23:37,057 --> 01:23:38,683
Fine line maybe but...

1113
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:41,878
I also built that library

1114
01:23:41,979 --> 01:23:44,889
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1115
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:47,049
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1116
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:49,485
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1117
01:23:50,086 --> 01:23:51,496
Money instead of sheets.

1118
01:23:51,697 --> 01:23:54,290
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

1119
01:24:10,007 --> 01:24:11,883
<i>♪ I know a cat named... ♪</i>

1120
01:24:11,884 --> 01:24:14,436
<i>Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965</i>

1121
01:24:14,437 --> 01:24:16,263
<i>on a two-year stretch for B&E.</i>

1122
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:18,873
<i>That's "breaking and entering" to you.</i>

1123
01:24:19,674 --> 01:24:23,386
<i>The cops caught him sneaking TV sets

1124
01:24:24,087 --> 01:24:25,521

<i>Cocky as hell.</i>

Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like
molasses! Making me look bad.

1128
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:35,574
<i>We liked him immediately.</i>

1129
01:24:36,075 --> 01:24:37,701
So I'm backing out the door, right?

1130
01:24:38,202 --> 01:24:39,994
And I got the TV like this.

1131
01:24:40,295 --> 01:24:43,915
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Suddenly, I hears this voice.

1132
01:24:43,916 --> 01:24:46,042
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

1133
01:24:46,043 --> 01:24:47,794
Well, I just stand there,

1134
01:24:47,795 --> 01:24:50,672
holding onto that TV. So,
finally, the voice says,

1135
01:24:50,673 --> 01:24:52,715
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

1136
01:24:52,716 --> 01:24:55,176
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did.

1137
01:24:55,177 --> 01:24:58,988
But if I drop this fucking thing,
you got me on destruction of property, too."

1138
01:25:02,893 --> 01:25:05,987
Hey, you've done a
stretch in Cashman, right?

1139
01:25:05,988 --> 01:25:09,607
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy
piece of time, let me tell you.

1140
01:25:09,908 --> 01:25:12,318
Weekend furloughs, work programs.

1141
01:25:12,519 --> 01:25:13,820
Not like here.

1142
01:25:14,121 --> 01:25:16,239
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

1143
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,992
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13.

1144
01:25:18,993 --> 01:25:21,211
You name the place,
chances are I've been there.

1145
01:25:21,412 --> 01:25:23,698
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

1146
01:25:25,499 --> 01:25:30,970
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

1147
01:25:31,071 --> 01:25:34,490
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

1148
01:25:34,591 --> 01:25:36,026
What are you in for?

1149
01:25:36,627 --> 01:25:37,232
Me?

1150
01:25:39,855 --> 01:25:41,519
The lawyer fucked me.

1151
01:25:45,552 --> 01:25:49,051
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1152
01:25:56,638 --> 01:26:00,688
<i>As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.</i>

1153
01:26:01,452 --> 01:26:03,222
<i>Maybe it was the thought
of them on the streets...</i>

1154
01:26:03,223 --> 01:26:05,964
<i>or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.</i>

1155
01:26:06,665 --> 01:26:10,681
<i>Whatever it was, something
lit a fire under that boy's ass.</i>

1156
01:26:14,465 --> 01:26:17,800
I was thinking of maybe trying
for my high school equivalency.

1157
01:26:17,801 --> 01:26:19,766
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1158
01:26:21,597 --> 01:26:23,686
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

1159
01:26:25,192 --> 01:26:27,357
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1160
01:26:29,113 --> 01:26:31,277
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1161
01:26:32,667 --> 01:26:34,193
You really mean that?

1162
01:26:35,194 --> 01:26:36,944
Yes, sir, I do.

1163
01:26:36,945 --> 01:26:42,588
Good. Because if we do this, we do it
all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1164
01:26:43,035 --> 01:26:44,999
The thing is, see...

1165
01:26:46,288 --> 01:26:48,002
...I don't read so good.

1166
01:26:48,949 --> 01:26:50,038
Well.

1167
01:26:52,211 --> 01:26:53,937
You don't read...

1168
01:26:54,138 --> 01:26:55,902
so well.

1169
01:26:57,883 --> 01:26:59,430
We'll get to that.

- So Andy took Tommy under his wing.</i>

1173
01:27:06,383 --> 01:27:08,781
<i>He started walking
him through his ABCs.</i>

1174
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:13,339
<i>Tommy took to it pretty well, too.</i>

1175
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,180
<i>The boy found brains
he never knew he had.</i>

1176
01:27:18,637 --> 01:27:22,415
<i>Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.</i>

1177
01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:23,858
<i>He really liked the kid.</i>

1178
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:27,208
<i>It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.</i>

1179
01:27:28,172 --> 01:27:30,498
<i>But that wasn't the only reason.</i>

1180
01:27:30,999 --> 01:27:32,839
<i>Prison time is slow time.</i>

1181
01:27:34,002 --> 01:27:36,337
<i>So you do what you can to keep going.</i>

1182
01:27:36,788 --> 01:27:38,589
<i>Some fellas collect stamps.</i>

1183
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:41,097
<i>Others build matchstick houses.</i>

1184
01:27:42,261 --> 01:27:44,517
<i>Andy built a library.</i>

1185
01:27:45,581 --> 01:27:47,307
<i>Now he needed a new project.</i>

1186
01:27:48,008 --> 01:27:49,434
<i>Tommy was it.</i>

1187
01:27:50,235 --> 01:27:54,230
<i>It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.</i>

1188
01:27:54,731 --> 01:27:57,939
<i>The same reason,
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.</i>

1189
01:27:59,136 --> 01:28:04,028
<i>In prison, a man will do most
anything to keep his mind occupied.</i>

1190
01:28:05,109 --> 01:28:09,871
<i>By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams,</i>

1191
01:28:10,372 --> 01:28:12,294
<i>it was lovely Raquel.</i>

1192
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:30,104
Time.

1193
01:28:36,031 --> 01:28:37,003
Well?

1194
01:28:38,609 --> 01:28:40,534
Well, it's for shit.

1195
01:28:41,235 --> 01:28:44,120
I wasted a whole fucking year
of my time with this bullshit.

1196
01:28:44,321 --> 01:28:46,073
It's probably not as bad as you think.

1197
01:28:46,074 --> 01:28:50,369
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1198
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:51,955
Let's see how the score comes out.

1199
01:28:51,956 --> 01:28:55,362
Well, I'll tell you how the
goddamn score comes out.

1200
01:28:57,177 --> 01:29:00,585
Two points right there.
There's your goddamn score!

1201
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:05,172
Goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5x5 is 25.

1202
01:29:05,477 --> 01:29:08,392
Fuck this place! Fuck it!

1203
01:29:27,324 --> 01:29:30,159
I feel bad. I let him down.

1204
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,744
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1205
01:29:32,245 --> 01:29:33,671
He's proud of you.

1206
01:29:33,972 --> 01:29:36,783
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1207
01:29:36,784 --> 01:29:40,044
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1208
01:29:40,345 --> 01:29:41,771
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1209
01:29:42,172 --> 01:29:43,998
What's he in here for, anyway?

1210
01:29:44,799 --> 01:29:45,880
Murder.

1211
01:29:46,927 --> 01:29:48,558
The hell you say!

1212
01:29:50,806 --> 01:29:52,679
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1213
01:29:54,142 --> 01:29:58,051
He caught his wife in bed with some
golf pro. He greased them both.

1214
01:30:06,355 --> 01:30:07,614
What?

1215
01:30:08,615 --> 01:30:10,975
About four years ago,

1216
01:30:11,476 --> 01:30:14,241
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1217
01:30:15,414 --> 01:30:18,579
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1218
01:30:19,593 --> 01:30:24,045
About six months left to go,
I get a new cellmate in.

1219
01:30:24,747 --> 01:30:26,203
Elmo Blatch.

1220
01:30:26,967 --> 01:30:28,851
Big, twitchy fucker.

1221
01:30:29,552 --> 01:30:32,555
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1222
01:30:33,056 --> 01:30:35,182
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1223
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:40,438
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1224
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:43,321
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1225
01:30:44,568 --> 01:30:49,113
Talked all the time, too.
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1226
01:30:49,114 --> 01:30:50,740
Places he'd been in,

1227
01:30:51,241 --> 01:30:54,093
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1228
01:30:54,794 --> 01:30:56,492
Even people he'd killed.

1229
01:30:58,248 --> 01:31:00,504
People who gave him shit.

1230
01:31:01,668 --> 01:31:03,094
That's how he put it.

1231
01:31:04,395 --> 01:31:05,321
So...

1232
01:31:05,422 --> 01:31:07,386
one night, like a joke,

1233
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:11,927
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1234
01:31:12,428 --> 01:31:13,804
So he says...

1235
01:31:13,805 --> 01:31:17,313
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1236
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,026
So I could case all these
big rich pricks that come in.

1237
01:31:24,566 --> 01:31:26,447
So I pick out this guy,

1238
01:31:27,611 --> 01:31:30,576
go in one night and do his place.

1239
01:31:32,366 --> 01:31:33,650
He wakes up.

1240
01:31:34,451 --> 01:31:35,974
He gives me shit.

1241
01:31:37,537 --> 01:31:38,902
So I killed him.

1242
01:31:40,665 --> 01:31:43,130
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1243
01:31:45,045 --> 01:31:46,842
That's the best part.

1244
01:31:48,006 --> 01:31:53,266
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.
But she's married to some other guy.

1245
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:56,394
Some hotshot banker.

1246
01:31:58,308 --> 01:32:00,273
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1247
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:15,544
I have to say that's the most
amazing story I ever heard.

1248
01:32:16,993 --> 01:32:19,954
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1249
01:32:20,455 --> 01:32:21,564
Sir?

1250
01:32:22,165 --> 01:32:23,416
Well...

1251
01:32:23,717 --> 01:32:27,277
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1252
01:32:27,778 --> 01:32:31,849
He hears your tale of woe and quite
naturally wants to cheer you up.

1253
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:34,176
He's young, not terribly bright.

1254
01:32:34,577 --> 01:32:37,739
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1255
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,349
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1256
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:44,478
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1257
01:32:45,379 --> 01:32:47,690
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1258
01:32:47,691 --> 01:32:49,984
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1259
01:32:49,985 --> 01:32:52,778
And by the way, add a life
term to my sentence"?

1260
01:32:52,779 --> 01:32:55,931
That doesn't matter. With Tommy's
testimony, I can get a new trial.

1261
01:32:55,932 --> 01:33:01,053
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1262
01:33:01,054 --> 01:33:03,422
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1263
01:33:03,523 --> 01:33:05,371
There's a chance, it isn't?

1264
01:33:07,836 --> 01:33:09,795
How can you be so obtuse?

1265
01:33:10,296 --> 01:33:11,177
What?

1266
01:33:12,799 --> 01:33:16,635
- What did you call me?
- Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1267
01:33:16,936 --> 01:33:18,512
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1268
01:33:18,513 --> 01:33:24,242
The country club will have his old timecards,
records, W-2s, with his name on them.

1269
01:33:24,243 --> 01:33:27,630
Dufresne, If you indulge this
fantasy, that's your business.

1270
01:33:27,631 --> 01:33:30,475
Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.

1271
01:33:30,476 --> 01:33:33,436
Sir, if I were to ever get out, I would
never mention what goes on in here.

1272
01:33:33,437 --> 01:33:36,660
I'd be just as indictable as
you for laundering money.

1273
01:33:37,975 --> 01:33:43,137
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch! Not in this office.

1274
01:33:43,138 --> 01:33:45,848
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1275
01:33:45,849 --> 01:33:48,884
I'm just trying to set your mind
at ease, that's all. Sir, I...

1276
01:33:48,885 --> 01:33:50,244
Solitary. A month.

1277
01:33:50,245 --> 01:33:52,596
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1278
01:33:52,597 --> 01:33:55,850
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1279
01:33:55,851 --> 01:33:57,935
It's my life! Don't you understand, my life?

1280
01:33:57,936 --> 01:34:00,679
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1281
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:01,814
No!

1282
01:34:01,815 --> 01:34:03,333
A month in the hole.

1283
01:34:04,034 --> 01:34:06,602
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1284
01:34:06,603 --> 01:34:08,279
It's all my fault.

1285
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,480
Oh, bullshit.

1286
01:34:10,571 --> 01:34:13,359
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1287
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,819
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1288
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,072
I mean, for real innocent?

1289
01:34:18,373 --> 01:34:19,599
It looks that way.

1290
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,826
Sweet Jesus.

1291
01:34:22,327 --> 01:34:24,053
How long's he been here now?

1292
01:34:24,454 --> 01:34:26,480
1947. What is that?

1293
01:34:26,581 --> 01:34:28,207
19 years...

1294
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:31,014
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1295
01:34:33,113 --> 01:34:35,744
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1296
01:34:36,675 --> 01:34:39,777
What you got? Board of Education.

1297
01:34:40,178 --> 01:34:42,829
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1298
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:45,558
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1299
01:34:45,759 --> 01:34:47,923
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1300
01:34:48,687 --> 01:34:51,318
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1301
01:34:52,482 --> 01:34:54,872
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1302
01:34:55,735 --> 01:34:57,400
Hey, Red!

1303
01:34:58,947 --> 01:35:00,945
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1304
01:35:06,955 --> 01:35:08,619
Well, shit.

1305
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:24,054
The kid passed. C+ average.

1306
01:35:24,355 --> 01:35:26,020
Thought you'd like to know.

1307
01:35:42,599 --> 01:35:44,163
The Warden wants to talk.

1308
01:35:57,973 --> 01:36:01,347
- Out here?
- That's what the man said.

1309
01:36:17,576 --> 01:36:18,752
Warden?

1310
01:36:19,653 --> 01:36:20,717
Tommy.

1311
01:36:27,202 --> 01:36:28,144
Tommy...

1312
01:36:28,545 --> 01:36:32,311
I'm asking you to keep this
conversation just between us.

1313
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:36,215
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1314
01:36:54,813 --> 01:36:56,777
We got a situation here.

1315
01:36:57,941 --> 01:37:00,067
I think you can appreciate that.

1316
01:37:00,068 --> 01:37:01,110
Yes, sir.

1317
01:37:01,611 --> 01:37:03,095
I sure can.

1318
01:37:03,396 --> 01:37:07,121
I tell you, son, this thing really came
along and knocked my wind out.

1319
01:37:08,952 --> 01:37:11,375
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1320
01:37:13,707 --> 01:37:15,271
The right thing to do.

1321
01:37:17,127 --> 01:37:20,409
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1322
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,162
You understand?

1323
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:26,824
I need your help, son.

1324
01:37:28,563 --> 01:37:30,648
If I'm going to move on this,

1325
01:37:30,849 --> 01:37:33,780
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1326
01:37:35,145 --> 01:37:38,847
I have to know if what you
told Dufresne was the truth.

1327
01:37:38,848 --> 01:37:40,232
Yes, sir.

1328
01:37:40,233 --> 01:37:41,642
Absolutely.

1329
01:37:42,143 --> 01:37:45,312
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury,

1330
01:37:45,413 --> 01:37:47,731
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1331
01:37:47,732 --> 01:37:50,525
and taken an oath before
Almighty God himself?

1332
01:37:50,526 --> 01:37:52,333
Just give me that chance.

1333
01:37:56,574 --> 01:37:58,121
That's what I thought.

1334
01:38:44,931 --> 01:38:46,696
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1335
01:38:48,468 --> 01:38:49,723
A terrible thing.

1336
01:38:51,304 --> 01:38:55,170
A man that young, less than
a year to go, trying to escape.

1337
01:38:55,975 --> 01:38:58,482
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1338
01:38:59,646 --> 01:39:01,110
Truly, it did.

1339
01:39:03,775 --> 01:39:06,139
We just have to put it behind us.

1340
01:39:08,029 --> 01:39:09,326
Move on.

1341
01:39:10,907 --> 01:39:12,263
I'm done.

1342
01:39:13,627 --> 01:39:15,791
Everything stops.

1343
01:39:17,155 --> 01:39:19,670
Get someone else to run your scams.

1344
01:39:20,925 --> 01:39:22,690
Nothing stops.

1345
01:39:24,154 --> 01:39:25,518
Nothing.

1346
01:39:28,391 --> 01:39:31,055
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1347
01:39:32,053 --> 01:39:34,321
No more protection from the guards.

1348
01:39:34,722 --> 01:39:39,189
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1349
01:39:41,062 --> 01:39:43,044
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1350
01:39:44,858 --> 01:39:46,384
And the library?

1351
01:39:46,985 --> 01:39:50,951
Gone. Sealed off, brick by brick.

1352
01:39:51,614 --> 01:39:54,291
We'll have us a little book
barbecue in the yard.

1353
01:39:54,292 --> 01:39:56,618
They'll see the flames for miles.

1354
01:39:56,819 --> 01:39:59,401
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1355
01:40:00,707 --> 01:40:02,208
You understand me?

1356
01:40:02,609 --> 01:40:04,273
Catching my drift?

1357
01:40:07,681 --> 01:40:09,645
Or am I being obtuse?

1358
01:40:21,102 --> 01:40:23,708
Give him another month to think about it.

1359
01:41:10,618 --> 01:41:13,546
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1360
01:41:14,647 --> 01:41:16,311
Like a closed book.

1361
01:41:17,241 --> 01:41:19,477
Complained about it all the time.

1362
01:41:20,078 --> 01:41:21,642
She was beautiful.

1363
01:41:24,174 --> 01:41:25,738
God, I loved her.

1364
01:41:29,462 --> 01:41:31,677
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1365
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:35,865
I killed her, Red.

1366
01:41:37,845 --> 01:41:39,810
I didn't pull the trigger.

1367
01:41:41,149 --> 01:41:43,013
But I drove her away.

1368
01:41:44,444 --> 01:41:46,770
That's why she died, because of me.

1369
01:41:47,271 --> 01:41:48,836
The way I am.

1370
01:41:57,699 --> 01:41:59,663
That don't make you a murderer.

1371
01:42:02,996 --> 01:42:04,960
A bad husband, maybe.

1372
01:42:08,459 --> 01:42:11,620
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1373
01:42:11,621 --> 01:42:12,722
No, I didn't.

1374
01:42:13,423 --> 01:42:14,945
Somebody else did.

1375
01:42:16,759 --> 01:42:18,724
And I wound up in here.

1376
01:42:21,222 --> 01:42:22,986
Bad luck, I guess.

1377
01:42:26,227 --> 01:42:27,120
Yeah.

1378
01:42:28,021 --> 01:42:29,497
It floats around.

1379
01:42:30,398 --> 01:42:32,541
It's got to land on somebody.

1380
01:42:33,542 --> 01:42:35,273
It was my turn, that's all.

1381
01:42:36,279 --> 01:42:38,619
I was in the path of the tornado.

1382
01:42:45,129 --> 01:42:48,662
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1383
01:42:53,171 --> 01:42:54,968
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1384
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:57,288
Me?

1385
01:43:00,103 --> 01:43:01,242
Yeah.

1386
01:43:02,605 --> 01:43:04,848
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1387
01:43:04,849 --> 01:43:08,231
and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1388
01:43:10,171 --> 01:43:11,835
I tell you where I'd go.

1389
01:43:13,266 --> 01:43:14,775
Zihuatanejo.

1390
01:43:15,776 --> 01:43:17,277
Zi... what?

1391
01:43:17,278 --> 01:43:18,904
Zihuatanejo.

1392
01:43:20,005 --> 01:43:21,870
It's in Mexico.

1393
01:43:23,184 --> 01:43:25,374
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1394
01:43:26,546 --> 01:43:28,806
You know what the Mexicans
say about the Pacific?

1395
01:43:29,207 --> 01:43:30,249
No.

1396
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:33,114
They say it has no memory.

1397
01:43:35,296 --> 01:43:37,719
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1398
01:43:39,425 --> 01:43:41,790
A warm place with no memory.

1399
01:43:45,006 --> 01:43:46,979
Open up a little hotel,

1400
01:43:48,735 --> 01:43:50,394
right on the beach.

1401
01:43:50,895 --> 01:43:53,021
Buy some worthless old boat,

1402
01:43:53,322 --> 01:43:54,987
fix it up new.

1403
01:43:57,869 --> 01:43:59,361
Take my guests out.

1404
01:44:00,062 --> 01:44:01,326
Charter fishing.

1405
01:44:05,268 --> 01:44:07,274
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1406
01:44:10,423 --> 01:44:13,981
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1407
01:44:20,925 --> 01:44:23,515
I don't think I could make
it on the outside, Andy.

1408
01:44:30,393 --> 01:44:32,357
I've been in here most of my life.

1409
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:35,856
I'm an institutional man now.

1410
01:44:36,357 --> 01:44:37,821
Just like Brooks was.

1411
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,695
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1412
01:44:41,996 --> 01:44:43,460
I don't think so.

1413
01:44:46,209 --> 01:44:51,204
I mean... in here, I'm the guy who
can get things for you, sure, but...

1414
01:44:52,205 --> 01:44:54,556
Outside, all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1415
01:44:54,656 --> 01:44:57,007
Hell, I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

1416
01:44:59,213 --> 01:45:00,731
The Pacific Ocean?

1417
01:45:01,532 --> 01:45:02,758
Shit.

1418
01:45:02,859 --> 01:45:05,112
About scare me to death,
something that big.

1419
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:06,312
Not me.

1420
01:45:07,613 --> 01:45:10,553
I didn't shoot my wife and
I didn't shoot her lover.

1421
01:45:12,393 --> 01:45:15,404
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1422
01:45:16,505 --> 01:45:18,453
That hotel, that boat.

1423
01:45:19,859 --> 01:45:21,907
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1424
01:45:26,857 --> 01:45:29,418
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1425
01:45:29,519 --> 01:45:31,345
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1426
01:45:32,146 --> 01:45:34,689
I mean, Mexico is way the hell
down there and you're in here...

1427
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:36,017
and that's the way it is.

1428
01:45:36,818 --> 01:45:39,424
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1429
01:45:40,997 --> 01:45:43,261
It's down there and I'm in here.

1430
01:45:45,893 --> 01:45:48,767
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice, really.

1431
01:45:51,524 --> 01:45:53,150
Get busy living

1432
01:45:54,251 --> 01:45:56,250
or get busy dying.

1433
01:46:00,366 --> 01:46:01,831
Andy.

1434
01:46:04,912 --> 01:46:06,077
Red.

1435
01:46:08,841 --> 01:46:11,142
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1436
01:46:11,543 --> 01:46:12,561
Sure, Andy.

1437
01:46:13,362 --> 01:46:14,175
Anything.

1438
01:46:15,981 --> 01:46:18,921
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1439
01:46:20,344 --> 01:46:23,222
Well, just... There's a lot
of hayfields up there.

1440
01:46:23,222 --> 01:46:28,451
One in particular. It's got a long rock wall,
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1441
01:46:28,452 --> 01:46:31,143
It's like something out
of a Robert Frost poem.

1442
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:34,830
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1443
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:40,635
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1444
01:46:41,657 --> 01:46:43,622
I asked and she said yes.

1445
01:46:47,872 --> 01:46:49,498
Promise me, Red,

1446
01:46:50,299 --> 01:46:53,807
if you ever get out, find that spot.

1447
01:46:55,171 --> 01:47:00,017
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that
has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1448
01:47:00,318 --> 01:47:03,800
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1449
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:09,767
There's something buried
under it, I want you to have.

1450
01:47:09,868 --> 01:47:11,353
What, Andy?

1451
01:47:11,854 --> 01:47:13,218
What's buried under there?

1452
01:47:15,233 --> 01:47:18,490
You'll have to pry it up... to see.

1453
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:26,114
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1454
01:47:27,178 --> 01:47:28,645
He's talking funnier.

1455
01:47:29,747 --> 01:47:33,307
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1456
01:47:33,308 --> 01:47:36,833
That's fine during the day, but
at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1457
01:47:38,039 --> 01:47:39,581
Oh, Lord.

1458
01:47:40,582 --> 01:47:41,504
What?

1459
01:47:43,094 --> 01:47:45,512
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1460
01:47:45,713 --> 01:47:49,199
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1461
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:53,061
- Six feet long.
- And you gave it to him?

1462
01:47:53,462 --> 01:47:57,223
- Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?
- Jesus, Heywood.

1463
01:47:57,224 --> 01:47:59,559
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1464
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:01,561
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1465
01:48:01,562 --> 01:48:02,484
No.

1466
01:48:03,447 --> 01:48:05,157
Andy would never do that.

1467
01:48:05,858 --> 01:48:07,122
Never.

1468
01:48:08,986 --> 01:48:10,451
I don't know.

1469
01:48:12,915 --> 01:48:15,080
Every man has his breaking point.

1470
01:48:17,828 --> 01:48:19,862
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1471
01:48:19,863 --> 01:48:21,920
Just about finished, sir.

1472
01:48:38,577 --> 01:48:40,505
Three deposits tonight.

1473
01:48:48,409 --> 01:48:50,293
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1474
01:48:50,694 --> 01:48:54,239
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1475
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:55,595
Yes, sir.

1476
01:49:00,913 --> 01:49:02,664
It's good having you back, Andy.

1477
01:49:03,165 --> 01:49:05,297
The place wasn't the same without you.

1478
01:49:52,065 --> 01:49:55,096
<i>Lights out!</i>

1479
01:50:25,956 --> 01:50:28,429
<u>I've had some long nights in stir.</u>

1480
01:50:29,193 --> 01:50:31,886
<i>Alone in the dark with
nothing but your thoughts,</i>

1481
01:50:31,987 --> 01:50:34,322
<i>time can draw out like a blade.</i>

1482
01:50:40,004 --> 01:50:42,919
<i>That was the longest night of my life.</i>

1483
01:50:58,781 --> 01:50:59,886
Give me a count.

1484
01:51:04,745 --> 01:51:06,871
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1485
01:51:06,872 --> 01:51:08,889
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1486
01:51:08,990 --> 01:51:13,360
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2. Cell 245.

1487
01:51:13,561 --> 01:51:15,129
Dufresne.

1488
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:17,929
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1489
01:51:20,753 --> 01:51:24,477
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1490
01:51:31,989 --> 01:51:35,650
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1491
01:51:35,651 --> 01:51:38,820
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1492
01:51:39,321 --> 01:51:40,535
You hear me?

1493
01:51:47,162 --> 01:51:49,127
Oh, my holy God.

1494
01:52:06,098 --> 01:52:08,208
I want every man on
this cell block questioned.

1495
01:52:08,809 --> 01:52:11,102
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1496
01:52:11,503 --> 01:52:12,592
Him!

1497
01:52:14,031 --> 01:52:15,696
Open 237.

1498
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:21,529
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1499
01:52:21,830 --> 01:52:23,556
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1500
01:52:23,607 --> 01:52:25,291
Don't say that to me again.

1501
01:52:25,292 --> 01:52:28,011
- But, sir, he wasn't.
- I can see that, Haig!

1502
01:52:28,412 --> 01:52:29,605
You think I'm blind?

1503
01:52:30,706 --> 01:52:33,816
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1504
01:52:33,817 --> 01:52:34,517
No, sir.

1505
01:52:36,002 --> 01:52:37,128
What about you?

1506
01:52:37,129 --> 01:52:38,247
Are you blind?

1507
01:52:39,048 --> 01:52:41,174
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1508
01:52:41,675 --> 01:52:45,053
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1509
01:52:45,054 --> 01:52:46,409
Dufresne.

1510
01:52:48,182 --> 01:52:50,332
He was in his cell at lights out.

1511
01:52:50,533 --> 01:52:53,224
It stands to reason he'd
still be here in the morning.

1512
01:52:54,229 --> 01:52:55,789
I want him found.

1513
01:52:56,190 --> 01:52:59,859
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1514
01:52:59,902 --> 01:53:00,882
Yes, sir!

1515
01:53:02,529 --> 01:53:04,994
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1516
01:53:07,951 --> 01:53:08,873
Stand.

1517
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,251
Well?

1518
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:15,958
Well, what?

1519
01:53:15,959 --> 01:53:19,300
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1520
01:53:20,464 --> 01:53:22,473
He must have said something.

1521
01:53:22,574 --> 01:53:24,100
No, sir, Warden.

1522
01:53:24,401 --> 01:53:25,840
Not a word.

1523
01:53:27,463 --> 01:53:29,944
Lord, it's a miracle!

1524
01:53:30,608 --> 01:53:33,451
A man up and vanished
like a fart in the wind.

1525
01:53:33,752 --> 01:53:35,386
Nothing left but...

1526
01:53:35,787 --> 01:53:38,289
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1527
01:53:38,590 --> 01:53:41,734
And that cupcake on
the wall. Let's ask her.

1528
01:53:41,735 --> 01:53:46,277
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1529
01:53:46,782 --> 01:53:49,109
Ah... I guess not.

1530
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:51,670
Why should she be any different?

1531
01:53:53,071 --> 01:53:54,914
This is a conspiracy.

1532
01:53:55,315 --> 01:53:56,808
That's what this is.

1533
01:53:57,409 --> 01:53:59,535
One... big...

1534
01:53:59,936 --> 01:54:01,671
damn conspiracy!

1535
01:54:01,672 --> 01:54:03,424
And everyone's in on it!

1536
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:05,997
Including her!

1537
01:54:40,377 --> 01:54:42,336
<i>In 1966,</i>

1538
01:54:42,337 --> 01:54:46,355
<i>Andy Dufresne escaped
from Shawshank Prison.</i>

1539
01:54:48,744 --> 01:54:52,079
<i>All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,</i>

1540
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:53,806
<i>a bar of soap</i>

1541
01:54:53,807 --> 01:54:58,066
<i>and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.</i>

1542
01:55:02,466 --> 01:55:07,387
<i>I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.</i>

1543
01:55:07,688 --> 01:55:10,578
<i>Old Andy did it in less than 20.</i>

1544
01:55:28,759 --> 01:55:30,723
<i>Oh, Andy loved geology.</i>

1545
01:55:31,887 --> 01:55:34,773
<i>I imagine it appealed to
his meticulous nature.</i>

1546
01:55:35,474 --> 01:55:37,250
<i>An Ice Age here,</i>

1547
01:55:37,751 --> 01:55:39,916
<i>a million years of mountain-building there.</i>

1548
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,178
<i>Geology is the study of pressure and time.</i>

1549
01:55:44,908 --> 01:55:46,835
<i>That's all it takes, really.</i>

1550
01:55:47,736 --> 01:55:48,862
<i>Pressure...</i>

1551
01:55:49,263 --> 01:55:50,822
<i>and time.</i>

1552
01:55:51,823 --> 01:55:54,539
<i>That and a big goddamn poster.</i>

1553
01:55:57,871 --> 01:55:59,247
<i>Like I said,</i>

1554
01:55:59,548 --> 01:56:03,222
<i>in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.</i>

1555
01:56:06,138 --> 01:56:11,292
<i>It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was
toting his wall out into the exercise yard.</i>

1556
01:56:11,393 --> 01:56:13,457
<i>A handful at a time.</i>

1557
01:56:14,913 --> 01:56:16,965
<i>I guess after Tommy was killed,</i>

1558
01:56:17,266 --> 01:56:20,284
<i>Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.</i>

1559
01:56:20,285 --> 01:56:22,675
Lickety-split.
I want to get home.

1560
01:56:23,589 --> 01:56:25,653
I'm just about finished, sir.

1561
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:48,935
Three deposits tonight.

1562
01:56:56,430 --> 01:56:58,352
<i>Andy did like he was told.</i>

1563
01:56:59,016 --> 01:57:02,199
<i>Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror shine.</i>

1564
01:57:06,107 --> 01:57:08,033
<i>The guard simply didn't notice.</i>

1565
01:57:08,634 --> 01:57:09,860
<i>Neither did I.</i>

1566
01:57:10,361 --> 01:57:15,077
<i>I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?</i>

1567
01:59:18,739 --> 01:59:24,994
<i>Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.</i>

1568
01:59:26,547 --> 01:59:28,831
<i>Or maybe I just don't want to.</i>

1569
01:59:33,062 --> 01:59:35,551
<i>500 yards.</i>

1570
01:59:36,015 --> 01:59:39,096
<i>That's the length
of five football fields.</i>

1571
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:42,391
<i>Just shy of half a mile.</i>

1572
02:00:37,534 --> 02:00:42,363
<i>The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,</i>

1573
02:00:42,764 --> 02:00:45,366
<i>a man nobody ever laid eyes on before</i>

1574
02:00:45,567 --> 02:00:48,169
<i>strode into the Maine National Bank.</i>

1575
02:00:48,570 --> 02:00:50,096
<i>Until that moment,</i>

1576
02:00:50,297 --> 02:00:51,956
<i>he didn't exist,</i>

1577
02:00:52,257 --> 02:00:55,100
<i>- except on paper.
- May I help you?</i>

1578
02:00:55,101 --> 02:00:57,128
<i>He had all the proper ID,</i>

1579
02:00:57,229 --> 02:01:01,040
<i>driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.</i>

1580
02:01:01,241 --> 02:01:04,218
<i>And the signature was a spot-on match.</i>

1581
02:01:04,269 --> 02:01:07,646
<i>I must say, I'm sorry to
be losing your business.</i>

1582
02:01:07,647 --> 02:01:09,531
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1583
02:01:09,732 --> 02:01:11,208
Thank you.

1584
02:01:11,609 --> 02:01:13,385
I'm sure I will.

1585
02:01:13,686 --> 02:01:15,496
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

1586
02:01:15,597 --> 02:01:17,023
Will there be anything else?

1587
02:01:17,424 --> 02:01:18,224
Please...

1588
02:01:18,808 --> 02:01:21,077
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1589
02:01:21,678 --> 02:01:23,371
I'd be happy to.

1590
02:01:24,872 --> 02:01:26,690
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1591
02:01:27,291 --> 02:01:31,467
<i>Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen
banks in the Portland area that morning.</i>

1592
02:01:32,255 --> 02:01:38,903
<i>All told, he blew town with better than
$370,000 of Warden Norton's money.</i>

1593
02:01:39,304 --> 02:01:43,312
<i>Severance pay for 19 years.</i>

1594
02:01:49,398 --> 02:01:52,071
Good morning,
Portland Daily Bugle.

1595
02:02:44,411 --> 02:02:47,596
Byron Hadley? You have
the right to remain silent.

1596
02:02:47,597 --> 02:02:49,223
If you give up
the right to remain silent,...

1597
02:02:49,224 --> 02:02:52,609
...anything you say will be held
against you in court of law.

1598
02:02:52,710 --> 02:02:54,170
<i>I wasn't there to see it.</i>

1599
02:02:54,171 --> 02:02:58,430
<i>But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.</i>

1600
02:03:04,673 --> 02:03:07,946
<i>Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.</i>

1601
02:03:24,041 --> 02:03:25,274
Samuel Norton?

1602
02:03:25,375 --> 02:03:28,217
<i>We have a warrant
for your arrest. Open up.</i>

1603
02:03:31,516 --> 02:03:32,124
Norton!

1604
02:03:32,625 --> 02:03:33,276
Open the door.

1605
02:03:33,877 --> 02:03:35,808
I'm not sure which key it is.

1606
02:03:38,507 --> 02:03:39,454
Norton!

1607
02:03:45,539 --> 02:03:47,203
<i>Make it easy on yourself, Norton.</i>

1608
02:03:59,327 --> 02:04:02,596
<i>I like to think the last
thing that went through his head,</i>

1609
02:04:02,897 --> 02:04:04,490
<i>other than that bullet,</i>

1610
02:04:04,691 --> 02:04:08,974
<i>was to wonder how the hell Andy
Dufresne ever got the best of him.</i>

1611
02:04:10,163 --> 02:04:11,730
Carter, James...

1612
02:04:11,731 --> 02:04:15,092
<i>Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,</i>

1613
02:04:15,393 --> 02:04:17,324
<i>I got a postcard in the mail.</i>

1614
02:04:18,555 --> 02:04:21,757
<i>It was blank, but the postmark said...</i>

1615
02:04:21,758 --> 02:04:23,893
<i>Fort Hancock, Texas.</i>

1616
02:04:24,494 --> 02:04:25,720
<i>Fort Hancock.</i>

1617
02:04:26,221 --> 02:04:27,847
<i>Right on the border.</i>

1618
02:04:28,348 --> 02:04:30,174
<i>That's where Andy crossed.</i>

1619
02:04:30,675 --> 02:04:34,733
<i>When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,</i>

1620
02:04:35,297 --> 02:04:37,761
<i>it always makes me laugh.</i>

1621
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:41,126
<i>Andy Dufresne,</i>

1622
02:04:41,527 --> 02:04:45,753
<i>who crawled through a river of shit
and came out clean on the other side.</i>

1623
02:04:46,783 --> 02:04:48,409
<i>Andy Dufresne,</i>

1624
02:04:48,910 --> 02:04:50,508
<i>headed for the Pacific.</i>

1625
02:04:53,415 --> 02:04:55,941
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1626
02:04:56,042 --> 02:04:59,837
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1627
02:04:59,838 --> 02:05:02,690
<i>Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.</i>

1628
02:05:03,491 --> 02:05:05,426
<i>I swear, the stuff he pulled...</i>

1629
02:05:05,427 --> 02:05:08,012
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1630
02:05:08,013 --> 02:05:09,977
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1631
02:05:11,566 --> 02:05:14,026
<i>Sometimes it makes me sad, though,</i>

1632
02:05:14,227 --> 02:05:15,953
<i>Andy being gone.</i>

1633
02:05:16,254 --> 02:05:19,937
<i>I have to remind myself that some
birds aren't meant to be caged.</i>

1634
02:05:21,142 --> 02:05:22,907
<i>Their feathers are just too bright.</i>

1635
02:05:24,671 --> 02:05:26,797
<i>And when they fly away,</i>

1636
02:05:26,898 --> 02:05:31,198
<i>the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.</i>

1637
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:33,813
<i>But still...</i>

1638
02:05:34,014 --> 02:05:38,163
<i>the place you live in is that much more
drab and empty that they're gone.</i>

1639
02:05:42,631 --> 02:05:45,062
<i>I guess I just miss my friend.</i>

1640
02:06:09,665 --> 02:06:11,021
Please sit down.

1641
02:06:16,531 --> 02:06:18,140
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1642
02:06:18,541 --> 02:06:22,002
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1643
02:06:22,603 --> 02:06:24,560
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1644
02:06:26,808 --> 02:06:28,072
Rehabilitated?

1645
02:06:30,336 --> 02:06:32,101
Well, now, let me see.

1646
02:06:33,265 --> 02:06:35,879
You know, I don't have
any idea what that means.

1647
02:06:37,794 --> 02:06:40,420
Well, it means you're
ready to rejoin society...

1648
02:06:40,421 --> 02:06:42,944
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1649
02:06:44,943 --> 02:06:47,107
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1650
02:06:48,271 --> 02:06:50,506
A politician's word so that...

1651
02:06:51,207 --> 02:06:56,291
young fellas like yourself can wear
a suit and a tie and... have a job.

1652
02:06:58,731 --> 02:07:00,496
What do you really want to know?

1653
02:07:01,584 --> 02:07:03,585
Am I sorry for what I did?

1654
02:07:03,986 --> 02:07:05,176
Well, are you?

1655
02:07:07,023 --> 02:07:09,888
There's not a day
goes by I don't feel regret.

1656
02:07:11,094 --> 02:07:14,801
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1657
02:07:18,018 --> 02:07:20,982
I look back on the way I was then.

1658
02:07:22,689 --> 02:07:24,315
A young...

1659
02:07:25,116 --> 02:07:28,181
stupid kid who
committed that terrible crime.

1660
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:33,304
I wanna talk to him.

1661
02:07:35,201 --> 02:07:37,749
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1662
02:07:38,413 --> 02:07:40,377
tell him the way things are.

1663
02:07:42,567 --> 02:07:43,832
But I can't.

1664
02:07:46,062 --> 02:07:47,927
That kid's long gone.

1665
02:07:49,341 --> 02:07:51,705
This old man is all that's left.

1666
02:07:53,353 --> 02:07:55,134
I gotta live with that.

1667
02:07:56,389 --> 02:08:00,351
Rehabilitated?
It's just a bullshit word.

1668
02:08:01,252 --> 02:08:06,153
So you go on and stamp your form,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1669
02:08:07,259 --> 02:08:09,085
Because to tell you the truth,

1670
02:08:09,686 --> 02:08:11,667
I don't give a shit.

1671
02:09:38,139 --> 02:09:39,664
Here you go, miss.

1672
02:09:42,487 --> 02:09:44,125
Rest room break, boss?

1673
02:09:49,794 --> 02:09:54,269
You don't need to ask me every time you
need to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1674
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:56,447
Yes, sir.

1675
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:09,943
<i>40 years I've been
asking permission to piss.</i>

1676
02:10:11,065 --> 02:10:13,955
<i>I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.</i>

1677
02:10:17,805 --> 02:10:19,670
<i>There's a harsh truth to face.</i>

1678
02:10:21,451 --> 02:10:23,965
<i>No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.</i>

1679
02:10:32,303 --> 02:10:36,044
<i>All I do any more is think
of ways to break my parole...</i>

1680
02:10:36,808 --> 02:10:39,072
<i>...so maybe they'd send me back.</i>

1681
02:10:44,398 --> 02:10:46,863
<i>A terrible thing to live in fear.</i>

1682
02:10:47,660 --> 02:10:51,518
<i>Brooks Hatlen knew it,
knew it all too well.</i>

1683
02:10:53,107 --> 02:10:56,381
<i>All I want is to be back
where things make sense,</i>

1684
02:10:56,945 --> 02:10:59,826
<i>where I won't have to
be afraid all the time.</i>

1685
02:11:01,825 --> 02:11:03,989
<i>Only one thing stops me.</i>

1686
02:11:05,353 --> 02:11:07,618
<i>A promise I made to Andy.</i>

1687
02:11:28,268 --> 02:11:29,532
Here it is.

1688
02:11:40,154 --> 02:11:41,819
Much obliged, sir.

1689
02:15:21,042 --> 02:15:22,417
<i>Dear Red,</i>

1690
02:15:22,418 --> 02:15:24,961
<i>if you're reading this, you've gotten out.</i>

1691
02:15:25,162 --> 02:15:29,099
<i>And if you've come this far, maybe
you're willing to come a little further.</i>

1692
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:32,065
<i>You remember the name
of the town, don't you?</i>

1693
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:36,144
Zihuatanejo.

1694
02:15:37,408 --> 02:15:40,727
<i>I could use a good man to help
me get my project on wheels.</i>

1695
02:15:41,528 --> 02:15:45,161
<i>I'll keep an eye out for you
and the chessboard ready.</i>

1696
02:15:46,025 --> 02:15:47,184
<i>Remember, Red,</i>

1697
02:15:47,485 --> 02:15:50,011
<i>hope is a good thing.</i>

1698
02:15:50,112 --> 02:15:51,938
<i>Maybe the best of things.</i>

1699
02:15:52,139 --> 02:15:54,204
<i>And no good thing ever dies.</i>

1700
02:15:54,867 --> 02:15:57,810
<i>I will be hoping that
this letter finds you</i>

1701
02:15:57,911 --> 02:15:59,538
<i>and finds you well.</i>

1702
02:16:00,039 --> 02:16:02,420
<i>Your friend, Andy.</i>

1703
02:16:36,617 --> 02:16:40,375
<i>Get busy living or get busy dying.</i>

1704
02:16:42,999 --> 02:16:44,963
<i>That's goddamn right.</i>

1705
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:52,799
<i>For the second time in my life,</i>

1706
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:55,165
<i>I'm guilty of committing a crime.</i>

1707
02:16:56,554 --> 02:16:58,638
<i>Parole violation.</i>

1708
02:16:59,139 --> 02:17:02,830
<i>Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.</i>

1709
02:17:03,703 --> 02:17:05,729
<i>Not for an old crook like me.</i>

1710
02:17:05,930 --> 02:17:07,994
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1711
02:17:11,527 --> 02:17:16,235
<i>I find I'm so excited I can barely sit
still or hold a thought in my head.</i>

1712
02:17:16,699 --> 02:17:19,784
<i>I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.</i>

1713
02:17:20,265 --> 02:17:25,378
<i>A free man at the start of a long journey
whose conclusion is uncertain.</i>

1714
02:17:28,377 --> 02:17:31,025
<i>I hope I can make it across the border.</i>

1715
02:17:32,523 --> 02:17:35,596
<i>I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.</i>

1716
02:17:37,595 --> 02:17:41,385
<i>I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.</i>

1717
02:17:43,459 --> 02:17:44,915
<i>I hope.</i>
