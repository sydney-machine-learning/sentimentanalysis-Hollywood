1
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,785
Hey, this area's restricted.

2
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:01,165
Hi. Yeah, I know. They called me down here.
Some of this wiring got screwed up.

3
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:04,668
Nobody called it down to me.
I'm gonna have to see a work order.

4
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:06,628
Yeah. Just a second.

5
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:12,009
There you are.

6
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,055
Nothing personal.

7
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,603
Well, I guess that wraps it up.
Good work, everybody.

8
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:27,691
Marty, I couldn't be happier
with the way this worked out.

9
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,571
Congratulations.

10
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,410
- Hold that.
- Whoa.

11
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:42,539
Gee, thanks.

12
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:55,051
Thanks for pushing that, Bob. The light's on,
but you never know, it might be broken.

13
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:56,928
Shut up.

14
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:13,945
Remember, honey...

15
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,405
Jesus. Bob, what button did you push?

16
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:47,414
Mr Bagwell, make sure these other elevators
remain locked down and empty.

17
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:52,336
There's no doors, no other way in or out,
except through access panels, correct?

18
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:57,633
What we have here are 13 passengers
in an express elevator below floor 30.

19
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:03,013
Bomb's taken out cables. Bomber wants
$3 million or he blows the brakes.

20
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:05,808
- What's our clock?
- He gave one hour.

21
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:09,395
That leaves us 23 minutes exactly.

22
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,815
- Anything to keep this elevator from falling?
- The basement.

23
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,900
We'd like to avoid that, Traven.

24
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:18,362
- We can't unload the passengers?
- This is an express elevator.

25
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:22,491
The only way in is through access panels.
The bomber's wired the hatch,

26
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:25,744
which seats him
in the "crazy but not stupid" section.

27
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:29,206
Sir, Harry volunteers to examine the device.

28
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:33,168
- Yeah, right.
- Fine. The two of you check it out.

29
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,255
The nearest access panel's
on the 32nd floor in the lobby.

30
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:41,093
I want reports only. We're in a holding
pattern. Worthy, Briggs, secure the base area.

31
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:44,305
Everyone else,
I want you to affirm building evac. Move!

32
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:47,308
Looks like we're walkin'.

33
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,644
- Hurry, but watch your step!
- 29.

34
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:53,814
All the way down to the lobby! Let's go, folks!

35
00:07:54,398 --> 00:07:55,859
30.

36
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,154
31.

37
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,782
32.

38
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,013
Hello?

39
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,851
- Come on! Get us outta here!
- Hello! Hello!

40
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:07,096
<i>Help! Please, get us out of here!</i>

41
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,515
Please!

42
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,874
<i>Please! Get us out of here!</i>

43
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,673
<i>Who's up there?
Who's up there? What's going on?</i>

44
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,509
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the LAPD.

45
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:47,970
- Thank God.
- What are you doing up there?

46
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:52,433
<i>There's been
an elevator malfunction, so just relax.</i>

47
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,020
<i>Hey, come on!
What are you guys waiting for?</i>

48
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:59,940
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

49
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,108
Am I lying?

50
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:07,655
How come they sent cops here?
Shouldn't they send repair guys?

51
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:17,582
What do you think?

52
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,796
- You're the expert. I just work here.
- Looks pretty solid.

53
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,717
- Anyone we know?
- I don't recognise the work, but he's a pro.

54
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:31,138
- He's cutting it close.
- I don't like it.

55
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:34,141
Well, what's to like?
Mac said we hold, so we hold.

56
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:48,031
All right, pop quiz.
The airport. Gunman with one hostage.

57
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,409
He's using her for cover.
He's almost to a plane.

58
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:54,120
You're 100 feet away.

59
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:01,461
Jack.

60
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:04,965
Shoot the hostage.

61
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:07,884
- What?
- Take her out of the equation.

62
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:12,097
Go for the good wound and he can't
get to the plane with her. Clear shot.

63
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,934
You're deeply nuts, you know that?
"Shoot the hostage."

64
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,316
Harry, this is wrong.
He's gonna blow it anyway.

65
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:27,696
- Why?
- I don't know. Gut feeling.

66
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:30,991
Right now Mac outranks your gut, so we sit.

67
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,911
This is taking way too long.

68
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,914
How much d'you think that elevator weighs?

69
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,083
Jack, come on.

70
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:46,006
Maybe we can do something
about those hostages.

71
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,590
<i>We're not gonna shoot 'em, right?</i>

72
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:53,012
<i>Hey, where you going?
What's going on?</i>

73
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:58,434
<i>Don't go! Don't leave us here!</i>

74
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:16,118
No, we just take them out of the equation.

75
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,112
- Are you sure it'll hold?
- It'll hold.

76
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,449
Six minutes.

77
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:58,952
I can't get any more time. He's not talking!

78
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:01,288
I need the goddamn money now.

79
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,761
Tell me again, Harry. Why did I take this job?

80
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:19,057
Oh, come on. 30 more years of this, you get
a tiny pension and a cheap gold watch.

81
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,850
Cool.

82
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,435
Ho!

83
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:56,427
- God, it's hot in here.
- There's no air.

84
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,513
- Can't they just pry the doors open?
- I can't breathe.

85
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,229
Don't fuck with Daddy.

86
00:14:41,056 --> 00:14:43,475
Usually they fall down now.

87
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:55,362
He's early. The son of a bitch is early!

88
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:17,091
Mac, we need more help up here now!

89
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:21,220
Oh, please! I don't wanna die!

90
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:22,638
Please save us!

91
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,814
<i>Open the door!
Open the door, please!</i>

92
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:39,113
<i>- Please help me!
- We'll get you out!</i>

93
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:44,243
- Give me your hands! It's OK.
- Pull me through.

94
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,005
<i>Watch your head. Watch your head.</i>

95
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,008
<i>- OK, I've got you.
- Take it easy.</i>

96
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,844
- You're fine. You're fine.
- Thank you.

97
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,721
- Take her.
- Who's next?

98
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,017
Thank you.

99
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,770
We've got you, ma'am.

100
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:19,696
- What the hell is all this?
- Help us! Hurry!

101
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:25,910
Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Go! Go!

102
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,704
Come on. Come on.

103
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:35,253
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

104
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:38,673
- Help me out! Please, help me out.
- Watch your head.

105
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,426
- Come on, lady!
- No.

106
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:44,220
Come on, lady! Come on! Grab my hand!

107
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,021
- Come on! Let's go! It's going to fall!
- No!

108
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:54,356
No, I can't!

109
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,901
Just take one step, reach out
and take my hand.

110
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,737
Come on! Come on!

111
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:07,993
- Oh, God! Don't let go of me!
- You're OK.

112
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,428
My shoe!

113
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:29,848
Was it good for you?

114
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:32,977
It was great for me.
How was it for you, honey?

115
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,188
- Elevator dropped.
- Good. That's good to know.

116
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,072
- Is your watch slow?
- No. He jumped the gun.

117
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:48,701
- We had three minutes left.
- Why does he do that?

118
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:50,619
He's losing his $3 million.

119
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,539
Maybe he couldn't hold his wad long enough.

120
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:58,043
It's a common problem among
middle-aged men. So I'm told.

121
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:08,012
- He's here.
- He could've blown that thing from Pacoima.

122
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:13,183
No. He knew we were up to something.
He's close by.

123
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:18,480
He's not gonna corner himself in a building
we evacuated anyway. Come on.

124
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:28,782
He'd... he'd wanna be here,
but he'd wanna stay mobile, right?

125
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:34,288
The elevators.

126
00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:37,709
Passenger cars were stopped.
They checked 'em out.

127
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,253
What about the freight elevators?

128
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,656
- Will the mystery guest please sign in?
- What?

129
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:11,785
Jack!

130
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:13,953
Damn it.

131
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:56,454
<i>Get to the side!</i>

132
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,848
<i>Shit! Shit! Shit!</i>

133
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:19,269
Up! Get your ass up!

134
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:07,524
I don't suppose anybody'll give me
three million just for you.

135
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:14,324
Hold it!

136
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:20,538
Pop quiz, hotshot.
Terrorist holding a police hostage.

137
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:25,961
Got enough dynamite strapped to his chest to
blow a building in half. Now what do you do?

138
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:29,130
There's gonna be 50 cops
waiting for you in the basement.

139
00:21:29,214 --> 00:21:31,424
Standard flanking deployment, right?

140
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:38,640
Maybe we'll get off on the third floor, huh?
At least that's what they'll think.

141
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:42,894
I want location on those goddamn shots!
Briggs! Where's Jack and Harry?

142
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:46,481
Lieutenant, we've got movement
on the freight elevator.

143
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,407
It's on three. Let's move!

144
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:03,123
End of the line. This day has been
real disappointing, I don't mind saying.

145
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:05,083
Because you didn't kill everyone?

146
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:09,087
There will come a time, boy,
when you'll wish you'd never met me.

147
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,214
Mister, I'm already there.

148
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:17,594
I'm in charge here. I drop this stick
and they pick your friend up with a sponge.

149
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:22,224
- Are you ready to die, friend?
- Fuck you.

150
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:26,729
In 200 years, we've come from "I regret
but I have one life to give for my country"

151
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,938
to "fuck you"?

152
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:31,191
- Go ahead. Drop the stick. Do it.
- Shut up, Harry.

153
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:34,486
We've got all the balls
in the world right here, man.

154
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,697
Give it up. You got nowhere to go!

155
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:39,366
Shoot the hostage.

156
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,829
Say goodbye, Harry.

157
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:50,461
You fuck!

158
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:54,131
Freeze!

159
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,384
Freeze!

160
00:22:57,468 --> 00:23:00,429
Give it up! You're out of options!

161
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:28,458
Through dedication and bravery,
these next two officers effected the rescue

162
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,544
of 13 citizens of this city.

163
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:36,341
And, thanks to them, the only life taken
by the terrorist's bomb was his own.

164
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:38,843
You shot me. I can't believe it.

165
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:42,097
They're giving you a medal
for shooting me, you little prick.

166
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,642
Harry, you told me to.

167
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,228
...the Los Angeles Police Department.

168
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:52,148
Officer Harry Temple.

169
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:08,748
<i>Officer Jack Traven.</i>

170
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:28,852
Way to go, Jack. Way to go.

171
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:31,938
- There we go.
- Harry, my man.

172
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:36,067
Beautiful. A toast to me.
Make me feel good about myself.

173
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:38,903
Hey, Sandy! Here we go!

174
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:41,156
OK, so how we doing? Whoa, whoa.

175
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:44,284
Shit. I need a bib!

176
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,456
- Here we go. All right.
- You can't take me anywhere.

177
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,834
And here is to Harry,

178
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:55,962
for his quick thinking,

179
00:24:56,755 --> 00:25:01,176
for his grace under pressure
and for his brave and selfless act.

180
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,345
<i>Hear! Hear!</i>

181
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:09,267
And to Jack, for shooting Harry.

182
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:12,687
Something we've all wanted to do
for a very long time.

183
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:15,357
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

184
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,484
OK, no, no. Here it is.

185
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:22,197
Here's to you guys for doing yourjob
and for not getting dead.

186
00:25:22,781 --> 00:25:25,075
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

187
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,878
We are the two luckiest guys in the world.

188
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:39,923
We got the bad guy
and we didn't lose any civilians.

189
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,258
- We're good.
- No. You were lucky.

190
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:46,136
No, we were lucky. You'd better understand it.

191
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,889
We were dealing with a total psycho.

192
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:52,101
This guy could've blown us up at any time.

193
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:55,479
And I got a bullet in me.

194
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,150
Six inches off the mark,
and they're giving the medal to my wife.

195
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:03,570
Harry, come on, man.
I mean, we won. We got him.

196
00:26:03,654 --> 00:26:06,573
Do you listen? Do you ever?

197
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:11,870
Because I am not gonna be around
to back you up, so you better start thinking.

198
00:26:13,163 --> 00:26:16,917
Guts'll get you so far,
and then they'll get you killed.

199
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:23,257
Luck runs out sooner or later. Right, Chief?

200
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,925
That's right.

201
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:27,594
Ho!

202
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:32,308
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm gonna go home, have some sex.

203
00:26:34,853 --> 00:26:40,233
- Harry, you're gonna go home and puke.
- Yeah, well, that'll be fun, too.

204
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:42,694
Come on, you gimp.

205
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:08,678
- Hey, Jack, saw you on TV. Congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.

206
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:11,139
- You looked fat.
- Take it easy on him, Bob.

207
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:14,517
- The boy was up late last night partying.
- Wild party, huh?

208
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:18,938
I don't remember that well.
Couldn't have been too great. Woke up alone.

209
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:24,111
Yeah? The last time I partied like that,
I woke up married, huh, Vinnie?

210
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:27,156
Hey, Jack, you forgot your muffins.

211
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:30,450
- Have a good one, Bob.
- Thanks, Jack. Take care.

212
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,202
Thanks.

213
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:46,257
See you tomorrow.

214
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:05,086
What do you think, Jack?

215
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:10,133
You think if you pick up all the bus driver's
teeth, they'll give you another medal?

216
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,217
Jesus!

217
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:13,887
You think I wouldn't have been prepared?

218
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:19,726
Two years I spent setting up that elevatorjob.
Two years I invested myself in it.

219
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,688
<i>You couldn't understand
the kind of commitment that I have.</i>

220
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:27,025
You ruined a man's life's work
and you think you can walk away?

221
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:32,238
You got blinders on to the world,
but I got your attention now, didn't I, Jack?

222
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:37,077
<i>- Why didn't you just come after me?
- This is about me. This is about my money.</i>

223
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,122
This is about money due me,
which I will collect.

224
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:43,416
$3.7 million.

225
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:48,296
<i>It's my nest egg, Jack.
At my age, you gotta think ahead.</i>

226
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,007
<i>- When I find you...
- Pop quiz, hotshot.</i>

227
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:53,885
There's a bomb on a bus.

228
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:58,181
Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour,
the bomb is armed.

229
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:02,769
If it drops below 50, it blows up.

230
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:05,689
What do you do? What do you do?

231
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:11,528
<i>- I'd wanna know what bus it was.
- You think I'm gonna tell you that?</i>

232
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:13,863
<i>- Yes.
- Very good.</i>

233
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:17,367
<i>There are rules, Jack,
and I want you to get this right.</i>

234
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,911
No one goes off the bus.

235
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:24,040
You try to take any passengers off the bus,
I will detonate it.

236
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:27,043
I want my money by 11am.

237
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:32,382
- We can't pull that kind of money in time.
- Focus, Jack!

238
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:38,096
Your concern is the bus.
And don't try to call. The radio's down.

239
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:43,727
<i>Now, the number of the bus is 2525.
It's running downtown from Venice.</i>

240
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:48,064
It is at the corner of Ocean Park and Main.

241
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,037
Sam!

242
00:31:04,413 --> 00:31:05,497
Sam!

243
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:06,999
Annie.

244
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:08,959
Sam! Tell him to stop!

245
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:12,171
Shit. Excuse me. Coming through! Sam!

246
00:31:14,757 --> 00:31:17,176
- Sam!
- This ain't no bus stop.

247
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:19,470
- Come on.
- Get rid of your butt, Annie.

248
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:22,181
OK, it's gone, it's gone.

249
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:27,311
You are a good, kind man. One day
people are gonna write songs about you.

250
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:38,239
- Hi.
- Hi.

251
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:51,461
- First time in LA.
- Oh, no. I live here.

252
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:54,674
<i>No, I mean mine. Oh, that's just funny.</i>

253
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:57,718
- You heard me wrong. I'm sightseeing.
- Oh, really?

254
00:31:57,802 --> 00:32:02,390
Yeah. I hate to use the word "tourist",
but it's not like I can hide it.

255
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:04,558
Not really.

256
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:13,067
Aw, jeez. You know, it took me three hours
just to get here from the airport. I got so lost.

257
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:17,405
LA is one large place. Course, you live here.
You probably don't notice.

258
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:21,033
I'm such a yokel. There. I said it.

259
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:24,495
You know what? I got gum on my seat.

260
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:26,664
Gum.

261
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:30,543
Excuse me.

262
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,087
- Morning.
- Hi.

263
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:39,444
I just couldn't handle the freeways any more.

264
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:41,613
I got so tense.

265
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:44,699
This way, I can just relax all the way to work.

266
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:48,620
Yeah, well, I love my car. I miss my car.

267
00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:03,510
<i>Oh, God. Look at that.</i>

268
00:34:05,553 --> 00:34:07,347
<i>- Hey, Sam!
- Shit.</i>

269
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,265
- Sam!
- What?

270
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:14,104
- Why don't you just drive over these people?
- Don't spit on my bus, Annie.

271
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:16,356
Such a mess.

272
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:33,915
Stop!

273
00:34:39,587 --> 00:34:43,258
- Open up!
- Get off the door. This ain't no bus stop.

274
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:46,428
- That guy really wants to get on the bus.
- Open up! Stop!

275
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:49,222
<i>- Don't, Sam! Don't let him on!
- LAPD!</i>

276
00:34:49,306 --> 00:34:51,308
- I can't hear you!
- Stop this bus!

277
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:53,310
<i>What?</i>

278
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:56,354
LAPD! Stop the bus!

279
00:34:56,438 --> 00:34:58,898
LAPD!

280
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:03,987
Stop! Stop!

281
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:08,450
- Stop! LAPD! Get out of the car.
- Jesus, not again.

282
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:12,078
This is my car. I own this car. It's not stolen.

283
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:14,914
- It is now. Move over.
- Fuck!

284
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:20,587
Man, you scratch this puppy, and me and you
are gonna have words, you understand?

285
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:43,401
OK, look, man, we don't have to go so fast.
Just slow down a little bit.

286
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:47,614
Oh, shit. Come on, man.

287
00:35:47,697 --> 00:35:50,742
Just... just don't tear up my car, all right?

288
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:55,414
OK, OK. Just slow down just a bit, all right?

289
00:35:55,498 --> 00:35:59,251
We don't have to go so fast, do we?
We don't have to go so...

290
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:04,465
That was a nice move, man.

291
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:06,342
Whoo!

292
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:18,645
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

293
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:21,356
The least you could do is slow down.
Come on.

294
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,109
Oh, shit.

295
00:36:24,943 --> 00:36:26,569
Oh, shit!

296
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,739
Move! Move!

297
00:36:32,575 --> 00:36:34,869
Is that that guy?

298
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:37,414
Man sure has a hard-on for this bus.

299
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:55,432
Hey! I'm a cop!

300
00:36:55,932 --> 00:36:57,183
What?

301
00:36:57,976 --> 00:36:59,436
I'm a cop!

302
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,606
LAPD! There's a bomb on your bus!

303
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:07,027
- What?
- There's a bomb on your bus!

304
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,280
There's a... What? Fuck!

305
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:14,410
- There's a bomb on your bus!
- Watch the road!

306
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:16,871
Grab that. I want you to write on it.

307
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:19,915
I want you to write on the back:
"Bomb on bus."

308
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,210
Write it, write it, write it!

309
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:40,728
Watch the road. Oh, shit.

310
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:55,034
Oh, shit!

311
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:56,911
No!

312
00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:59,205
Don't slow down!

313
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:06,169
No! No, no, no, no, no!

314
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:08,713
Speed up!

315
00:38:09,381 --> 00:38:10,548
Op...

316
00:38:10,632 --> 00:38:12,759
Open your door!

317
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:15,220
Open the doors!

318
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:20,266
50! Stay above 50!

319
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:23,061
All right?

320
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:30,652
4708000. Ask for Detective Harry Temple.

321
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:35,240
Harry.

322
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:37,409
Harry, it's Jack.

323
00:38:41,162 --> 00:38:44,124
You better not be calling in sick,
cos I dragged my ass...

324
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:47,043
- Harry, he's alive.
- What?

325
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,379
<i>The bomber. He's back.</i>

326
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:52,716
He hit one in Venice already.
There's nothing left.

327
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:56,303
We got a ransom demand from your
dead terrorist. Says he's rigged a bus.

328
00:38:56,386 --> 00:38:58,555
- Where's Jack?
- Where do you think?

329
00:38:58,638 --> 00:39:01,683
- I gotta get on that bus.
- You gotta get...

330
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,893
Yeah, yeah. You get on the bus.

331
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:06,229
Drive straight!

332
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:08,690
Stay in this lane!

333
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,317
Watch the road.

334
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:16,573
Wait a minute. What are you doin'?

335
00:39:16,656 --> 00:39:18,992
- Are you insured?
- Yeah! Why?

336
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,911
No! No!

337
00:39:25,415 --> 00:39:28,209
You broke my... my door.

338
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:33,006
- Sir, I need to take your phone.
- Take the phone.

339
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,926
- Take the wheel.
- What are you... What?

340
00:39:37,844 --> 00:39:40,221
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

341
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:47,269
Drive straight.

342
00:39:53,317 --> 00:39:55,362
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

343
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:01,576
Oh, shit!

344
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:07,165
Whoa! Shit!

345
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:22,515
This guy's out of his mind.

346
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:27,311
OK, listen, you gotta stay above 50.

347
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:31,357
- Excuse me, are you out of your mind?
- Whatever it takes.

348
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:35,486
Everybody, I'm Jack Traven, LAPD.

349
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:38,948
We have a slight situation on the bus.
If you'll please sit down.

350
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:42,994
- You're scaring the shit out of these people.
- Ma'am, please!

351
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:50,584
If everybody will stay in your seats
and remain calm,

352
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:53,421
we should be able to defuse the problem...

353
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,881
Get away from me!

354
00:41:00,136 --> 00:41:04,056
I don't know you, man.
I'm not here for you. Let's not do this.

355
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,725
- Stop the bus!
- He can't.

356
00:41:05,808 --> 00:41:08,936
Shut up! Stop the bus! Stop it!

357
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,105
Listen!

358
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:14,567
Look, I'm putting my gun away, OK?

359
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:18,988
OK?

360
00:41:20,865 --> 00:41:25,578
Now, listen. I don't care about your crime.

361
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:32,083
Whatever you did, I'm sure that you're sorry,
so it's cool now. It's over.

362
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:39,591
And I'm not a cop right now.

363
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:45,513
See? We're just two cool guys,
just hanging out...

364
00:41:49,934 --> 00:41:51,019
Sam!

365
00:41:55,732 --> 00:41:59,110
I've got the wheel! I've got it!
Sam! Oh God, Sam!

366
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:08,828
<i>You've gotta move your legs.
Can somebody move his legs?</i>

367
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:13,792
Sam, get your foot...
Sam, get your foot off the pedal!

368
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:18,338
- I gotta stop this thing!
- No! Don't! Stay above 50!

369
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:24,302
- Sam's been shot! We gotta get him off!
- You slow down and this bus'll explode!

370
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:31,977
There is a bomb on this bus.

371
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,814
If we slow down, it'll blow.

372
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:40,277
If anyone tries to get off, it'll explode.

373
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:42,863
Bullshit! Yeah, there's a bomb.

374
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:46,158
- Some funny joke, man.
- Are we gonna have a problem now?

375
00:42:46,242 --> 00:42:49,328
He's bleeding so much.
I don't know what to do.

376
00:42:49,412 --> 00:42:54,917
Put pressure front and back, keep
his legs up and put this under his head.

377
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:57,920
- Hold on, man.
- Sam, lift your head.

378
00:42:58,004 --> 00:43:01,549
- Can you handle this bus?
- Sure. It's like driving a really big Pinto.

379
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:07,138
- I need to know! Can you handle it?
- I'm fine. Just tell me what the plan is.

380
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:10,016
- Is there a plan?
- For you to drive. We're OK for now.

381
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:12,435
- Just keep us above 50.
- Good plan.

382
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:18,481
- So, you're a cop, right?
- That's right.

383
00:43:18,565 --> 00:43:22,986
Well, I should probably tell you that
I had my driver's licence revoked.

384
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:26,364
- What for?
- Speeding.

385
00:43:30,243 --> 00:43:34,247
Harry, we're on our way to the chopper.
If anything changes, let us know.

386
00:43:34,331 --> 00:43:37,250
Anything we haven't seen
should be in here.

387
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:11,618
<i>... wrong with the driver,
but at least one car, a Jaguar,</i>

388
00:44:11,701 --> 00:44:15,872
<i>has been driven off the road
by the speeding bus.</i>

389
00:44:15,956 --> 00:44:19,417
<i>The bus came onto the freeway
at the Lincoln onramp.</i>

390
00:44:19,501 --> 00:44:23,338
<i>It began picking up speed, swerving,
and hasn't slowed down since.</i>

391
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:28,719
<i>Minutes ago a police officer boarded the bus
by jumping onto it from a moving car.</i>

392
00:44:28,803 --> 00:44:31,681
Would that be you, Jack?

393
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:34,600
<i>- Where do we start?
- The speedometer.</i>

394
00:44:34,684 --> 00:44:38,896
Has it been fucked with or loosened?
See any wires or anything?

395
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,856
Excuse me, ma'am.

396
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,025
No, it's clean.

397
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:46,612
Then it's gonna be under the bus.
Probably rigged to one of the axles.

398
00:44:46,696 --> 00:44:49,991
I can't get under the bus right now.
It's kind of in motion.

399
00:44:50,074 --> 00:44:52,410
Excuse me! Excuse me!

400
00:44:53,452 --> 00:44:54,537
Hold on.

401
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,415
Access panel... in the floor.

402
00:44:58,582 --> 00:45:00,667
Underneath you, man.

403
00:45:02,877 --> 00:45:08,967
All right, Harry. We're in. Passenger relay.
Sir, take this. I want you to tell him what I see.

404
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,554
OK.

405
00:45:12,637 --> 00:45:15,182
We got a wad! Pretty big!

406
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,144
- There's a pretty big wad.
- Brass fittings!

407
00:45:18,227 --> 00:45:21,605
- Brass fittings.
- I think I can reach the circuit wire.

408
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:26,110
- He can reach the circuit wire.
- No, don't. That's a decoy. Classic.

409
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:28,195
<i>- Classic decoy.
- What else?</i>

410
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:30,489
- What else?
- Hold on.

411
00:45:30,573 --> 00:45:32,700
Hold on.

412
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:42,918
Fuck me!

413
00:45:45,296 --> 00:45:46,505
Oh, darn.

414
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:53,179
Harry, there's enough C4 on this thing
to put a hole in the world.

415
00:45:53,262 --> 00:45:56,265
OK, all right. Just stay calm. What else?

416
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:59,810
Three triggers - one on the axle
I can't really see, a cellular remote

417
00:45:59,894 --> 00:46:03,689
and a timer running off a wristwatch.

418
00:46:03,773 --> 00:46:06,192
<i>- A watch? What kind of watch?
- Gold.</i>

419
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:08,235
Gold band. Fairly cheesy.

420
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:10,863
Officer!

421
00:46:10,946 --> 00:46:13,366
- Officer!
- What's on your mind, Harry?

422
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:15,660
Shit. What do I do? Officer!

423
00:46:16,494 --> 00:46:17,912
- What do I do?
- Oh, shit.

424
00:46:17,995 --> 00:46:20,665
- Which way? Which way?!
- Get on the shoulder.

425
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:21,832
OK.

426
00:46:34,887 --> 00:46:35,930
Watch it!

427
00:46:43,562 --> 00:46:47,065
Stay on or get off? Stay on or get off?

428
00:46:47,148 --> 00:46:50,151
Off! Off! Hold on!

429
00:47:07,669 --> 00:47:09,337
Oh, God.

430
00:47:14,926 --> 00:47:17,262
<i>- Keep going.
- It's red!</i>

431
00:47:17,345 --> 00:47:19,889
Go! Go!

432
00:47:34,529 --> 00:47:36,239
This is much better.

433
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,580
<i>... city streets. The bus is on Western,
heading in a southbound direction.</i>

434
00:47:43,663 --> 00:47:47,876
<i>Now, where the bus did exit here,
it had a couple of close calls.</i>

435
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:50,670
Yeah! Yeah! All right!

436
00:47:51,546 --> 00:47:53,924
<i>We don't know what authorities plan to do.</i>

437
00:48:02,892 --> 00:48:05,353
<i>I don't get it.</i>

438
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:09,065
The watch is a shitty timer.
Why use it? What's he saying?

439
00:48:09,148 --> 00:48:12,485
- Lots of people have watches, Harry.
- This guy has no MO.

440
00:48:12,568 --> 00:48:16,364
A bomber falls in love with one kind
of bomb and they're very monogamous.

441
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:21,827
This guy uses C4, dynamite, different trigger
every time, and now he throws in this watch.

442
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:24,872
He's an encyclopaedia of bombs.
He knows every kind.

443
00:48:24,956 --> 00:48:28,084
Yeah, and everything we do to dismantle it.

444
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,295
Wait a minute.

445
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:36,007
I wanna look at the files for the last 10 years.

446
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:40,470
- We did the mug shots. It's not gonna help.
- No. I wanna look at cops.

447
00:48:41,262 --> 00:48:43,349
Come on. Let's go.

448
00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:52,108
Yeah. Mac, where have you been?

449
00:48:52,191 --> 00:48:55,027
I had to bail on the freeway.
We're in the city.

450
00:48:55,111 --> 00:48:58,322
I can see you. Just keep going straight.

451
00:48:58,406 --> 00:49:02,285
I'm gonna try to clear the roads for you.
Just stay on line.

452
00:49:05,913 --> 00:49:08,374
Shit! Oh, Jesus! God! No!

453
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:09,500
Go left!

454
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:13,504
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God!

455
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:23,014
Oh, jeez!

456
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:28,894
People, stay out of my way!
Stay out of my way!

457
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:32,815
- Ma'am, up to the right.
- OK, OK, OK. I see it, I see it.

458
00:49:39,572 --> 00:49:42,825
Mac! Mac, you've gotta get me outta here!

459
00:49:45,995 --> 00:49:50,291
A few more blocks,
you're gonna come up to a soft turn. Right.

460
00:49:50,374 --> 00:49:53,586
Then hold straight. I've got
some units waiting for you there.

461
00:49:53,669 --> 00:49:58,674
They're gonna lead you to the 105 freeway.
It's not in use. It'll be empty.

462
00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:01,510
<i>- You'll be totally clear.
- Got it.</i>

463
00:50:04,972 --> 00:50:08,726
<i>In a few blocks,
we take the soft turn to the right.</i>

464
00:50:11,812 --> 00:50:15,315
OK. Wait a minute. Escort to where?
Where do we get an escort to?

465
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:17,442
Look out!

466
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:20,654
Oh, God!

467
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:27,786
Son of a bitch!

468
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:30,413
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

469
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:36,170
- Oh, God! I just hit the baby!
- Cans!

470
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:40,383
- There was no baby. It was full of cans.
- Are you sure?

471
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:02,363
Oh, jeez. No! No! No!

472
00:51:10,955 --> 00:51:14,750
- Why aren't they at school?
- Mac, we're boned.

473
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:16,669
I'll get you out, Jack.

474
00:51:26,262 --> 00:51:29,307
All right, listen.
You got an entrance coming up, Jack.

475
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,184
It's gonna be a real ugly turn, though.

476
00:51:32,268 --> 00:51:34,395
- How ugly?
- What's ugly?

477
00:51:34,895 --> 00:51:38,399
We got a hard right coming up
at the construction site.

478
00:51:39,108 --> 00:51:41,944
- This should be it.
- That is a dead end.

479
00:51:42,028 --> 00:51:46,449
- I can't make that turn.
- You can make it. Keep left. Make it wide.

480
00:51:46,532 --> 00:51:49,827
Oh, God. We're gonna tip over.
We're gonna tip over.

481
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,831
You're right. We're gonna tip over.
Everyone on this side of the bus now!

482
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:56,751
On this side of the bus!
As far as you can, please.

483
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:58,918
Hold on!

484
00:51:59,002 --> 00:52:04,299
Over here. Over here. As far as you can! Now!
Mac, you better clear this site out.

485
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,892
- Everybody hold on!
- This side of the bus!

486
00:52:13,975 --> 00:52:16,144
Hold on!

487
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:21,900
Hold on! Oh, God! Here we go! Here we go!

488
00:52:25,028 --> 00:52:26,613
Here we go!

489
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:41,503
Whoo!

490
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:44,464
Oh, my God! Oh, God! Is everybody all right?

491
00:52:44,547 --> 00:52:46,800
- Yes!
- Oh, my God.

492
00:52:46,883 --> 00:52:49,552
Take me to that interchange at the 105.

493
00:53:00,106 --> 00:53:04,318
Oh, my God. We might've died. I can't think.

494
00:53:04,402 --> 00:53:08,114
It's OK. If you need to,
you go right ahead and vomit.

495
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:30,679
Frank, get rid of that scaffolding
and replace it with webbing.

496
00:53:30,762 --> 00:53:34,766
Norwood, I want aerial units up ahead.
No obstructions in the freeway.

497
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:38,395
We have a window here.
I wanna make sure it stays open.

498
00:53:59,498 --> 00:54:00,750
Shoot.

499
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:05,630
Could you do me a favour
and hold the wheel for me for a second?

500
00:54:05,713 --> 00:54:08,132
Hold the wheel? Thank you.

501
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:14,347
Ma'am, you did very well. Actually, you were
incredible. I've never seen driving like that.

502
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,140
- Annie.
- What?

503
00:54:16,223 --> 00:54:18,100
It's my name. Annie.

504
00:54:18,684 --> 00:54:21,854
- Annie.
- As opposed to "ma'am".

505
00:54:21,937 --> 00:54:23,481
OK.

506
00:54:26,984 --> 00:54:30,446
So, why is all this happening?

507
00:54:30,529 --> 00:54:35,201
I mean, what did we do?
Bomb the guy's country or something?

508
00:54:35,284 --> 00:54:37,995
No. It's just a guy who wants money.

509
00:54:39,413 --> 00:54:42,792
I don't buy that.
It's not a very good way to make money.

510
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:47,630
So, um... what is this guy's deal?

511
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:52,176
A while back,
he held some people for ransom.

512
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:55,471
It went sour,
and now he's a little pissed at me.

513
00:54:55,554 --> 00:54:59,684
- What does that have to do with us?
- Nothing. It's a game.

514
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:03,312
If he gets the money, he wins.
If the bus blows up, he wins.

515
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:06,065
- What if you win?
- Tomorrow we'll play another one.

516
00:55:06,148 --> 00:55:09,235
But I'm not available
to drive tomorrow. Busy.

517
00:55:13,406 --> 00:55:15,825
We got no match for that description.

518
00:55:15,908 --> 00:55:18,577
No one's lost a thumb
for at least the last 10 years.

519
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:21,998
- He could be from anywhere.
- I can't access all that.

520
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:25,293
Forget the files.
Start going through the pension fund.

521
00:55:25,376 --> 00:55:29,212
This guy's drawing disability. He may not
be LAPD, but he's living here now.

522
00:55:29,296 --> 00:55:32,590
I want pictures! I've seen this asshole.

523
00:55:46,855 --> 00:55:51,234
- Hey! Let's get these passengers off the bus!
- We can't do it, sir!

524
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:55,239
There's no time for any stunts.
We gotta get these people out of harm's way.

525
00:55:55,323 --> 00:55:58,701
I got orders. We move these people, he'll see.

526
00:56:01,245 --> 00:56:03,623
Remember: Crazy, not stupid.

527
00:56:03,706 --> 00:56:08,127
Harry's trying to find out who this guy is.
We think maybe he's a cop.

528
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,880
Lieutenant, it's him.

529
00:56:10,963 --> 00:56:14,383
- He wants to talk to Jack.
- He's on the line for you.

530
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:18,387
- OK, give him the number.
- Give him the number.

531
00:56:21,057 --> 00:56:23,476
- How's he doing?
- The bleeding is less, but...

532
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:27,188
- Are they going to help us?
- Sure they are. They're the police.

533
00:56:27,271 --> 00:56:32,068
Hey, your taxes are paying their salary.
If we die, they gotta take a pay cut.

534
00:56:34,904 --> 00:56:36,489
I mean, you know.

535
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:41,035
Yeah.

536
00:56:41,118 --> 00:56:46,916
I think we have trust, but it looks on TV
like you're trying to get those passengers off.

537
00:56:46,999 --> 00:56:50,419
<i>- Look, you've gotta let me have one.
- We went over the rules.</i>

538
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:54,465
As an act of faith. We have
an injured man here. The driver's been shot.

539
00:56:54,548 --> 00:56:57,259
Tell me you haven't
been shooting the passengers.

540
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:02,306
I thought it was customary
for a police officer to shoot the bad guys.

541
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:06,227
- This man has no time.
- No one gets off.

542
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:11,565
It'll grease the wheels with the money men.
There's still gonna be plenty of us to kill.

543
00:57:12,608 --> 00:57:15,736
OK, son, you can try and unload the driver.

544
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:20,157
You tell that wildcat behind the wheel
not to slow down, though,

545
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:24,829
or he won't even get a chance
to bleed to death. And, Jack, don't slip.

546
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:30,626
- He's letting us unload the driver.
- Norwood! Get us closer!

547
00:57:32,003 --> 00:57:34,297
- We're gonna get the driver off.
- Just him?

548
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,632
- For now. Gigantor.
- Ortiz.

549
00:57:36,716 --> 00:57:40,720
Ortiz, we're gonna need your help.
I need you to pass him to me.

550
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:43,180
Keep him straight, or the wound'll tear.

551
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:47,018
- What about the rest of us?
- Hey, hey, hey! Lady!

552
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:50,855
<i>I can't stay!</i>

553
00:57:52,064 --> 00:57:55,026
- How are you feeling?
- Like I've been shot.

554
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:57,194
- Take care, Sam.
- OK, Annie.

555
00:57:58,154 --> 00:58:00,740
Drive straight!

556
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:07,830
- Get as close as you can, OK?
- All right.

557
00:58:07,913 --> 00:58:11,459
Closer. A little closer, Annie.

558
00:58:13,169 --> 00:58:15,254
- Annie, a little closer.
- OK.

559
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,967
<i>OK, how's this?</i>

560
00:58:21,594 --> 00:58:23,804
Sorry. Sorry.

561
00:58:23,888 --> 00:58:27,433
OK, Annie. No problem.
Let's try it one more time.

562
00:58:28,517 --> 00:58:30,061
A little more!

563
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:33,273
OK! OK! Right there! Steady! Hold it steady!

564
00:58:34,566 --> 00:58:37,110
You got him? You got him?

565
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:46,411
I'm all right. Thanks.

566
00:58:46,495 --> 00:58:48,997
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

567
00:58:58,631 --> 00:59:00,716
<i>He's gonna be OK.</i>

568
00:59:03,552 --> 00:59:05,846
Come on! Come on, lady. Give me your hand.

569
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:08,683
- I have to, Annie.
- No, Helen!

570
00:59:08,766 --> 00:59:10,977
- No, Helen, no!
- Come on!

571
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,144
Helen, no! No!

572
00:59:12,228 --> 00:59:17,692
<i>I'm here at the 105 Freeway, where the police
have successfully led the runaway bus...</i>

573
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:21,862
No, Helen!

574
00:59:37,295 --> 00:59:40,631
Goddamn it, Mac!
Get those fucking choppers outta here!

575
00:59:40,715 --> 00:59:44,010
<i>... was driving the bus.
Well, I couldn't tell how old...</i>

576
00:59:44,093 --> 00:59:46,971
<i>An explosion. Some kind of an explosion.</i>

577
00:59:47,054 --> 00:59:50,141
<i>The bus hasn't exploded, but... Oh, my God.</i>

578
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:54,645
<i>A woman caught in the blast fell. She was
pulled under the wheels. This is terrible.</i>

579
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:58,983
Interactive TV, Jack. Wave of the future, huh?

580
01:00:20,838 --> 01:00:22,923
I can't be here.

581
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:26,469
I can't, you know...

582
01:00:27,136 --> 01:00:29,597
This is the wrong bus.

583
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,766
I mean, for me to...

584
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:35,561
I can't die here.

585
01:00:35,645 --> 01:00:37,730
Hey, shut up, man.

586
01:00:38,939 --> 01:00:41,317
- I got a wife.
- Oh, you do?

587
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,987
Hey! So if you have a wife and I don't,
does that mean I'm expendable?

588
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:48,365
What are you talking about, man?

589
01:00:48,448 --> 01:00:50,659
The guy's just talking crazy.

590
01:00:50,742 --> 01:00:53,745
He gets on my nerves.
He gets on everybody's nerves.

591
01:00:53,828 --> 01:00:59,376
- I think I have the right to be a little upset.
- What are you staring at, anyway?

592
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:02,337
Why don't you let us all die in peace,
if it has to happen?

593
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:07,300
Oh, so you're a really tough guy, huh?
Why don't we just step outside?

594
01:01:07,384 --> 01:01:09,469
Hey!

595
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:25,987
How are you doing? You all right?

596
01:01:26,862 --> 01:01:28,949
What can I do?

597
01:01:30,534 --> 01:01:33,078
When that bomb went off...

598
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:35,080
I know.

599
01:01:35,163 --> 01:01:40,043
I thought that was it.
I thought that was the bomb, and I was dead.

600
01:01:40,127 --> 01:01:44,464
And then when I saw her body fall
under the bus, it was like...

601
01:01:44,548 --> 01:01:47,050
You were glad you were still alive.

602
01:01:49,136 --> 01:01:51,888
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

603
01:01:51,972 --> 01:01:54,474
You should be glad. We all are.

604
01:01:56,518 --> 01:01:59,688
- It doesn't mean you don't care.
- I know, but she was so scared.

605
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:02,983
She was a nice lady
who didn't deserve to get killed,

606
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:06,153
but if she'd gotten off,
it would have killed us all.

607
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:10,699
He's the asshole, Annie. The guy
who put us here. Remember that, OK?

608
01:02:10,782 --> 01:02:13,577
Big asshole.

609
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:16,413
OK.

610
01:02:18,624 --> 01:02:20,792
Are you sure?

611
01:02:20,876 --> 01:02:22,961
Well, how far?

612
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,049
Sir, we have a serious problem.

613
01:02:29,467 --> 01:02:30,593
What?

614
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:34,764
- This freeway isn't finished.
- What are you talking about?

615
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:40,227
The aerial unit caught it. About three miles
ahead there's a section missing.

616
01:02:40,311 --> 01:02:42,396
A section missing?

617
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:51,322
But it's on the map.
It's finished on the goddamn map!

618
01:02:51,405 --> 01:02:53,491
I guess they fell behind.

619
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:58,537
Fuck! You're fired. Everybody's fucking fired!

620
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:02,208
Get me closer!

621
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:05,169
Hey, get closer. Watch him in the mirror.

622
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,005
Jack!

623
01:03:10,257 --> 01:03:13,886
- How big is the section?
- 50 feet... at least.

624
01:03:19,225 --> 01:03:22,436
There's a gap in the road up ahead. It's big.

625
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:26,983
- You're kidding. How big?
- 50 feet.

626
01:03:27,066 --> 01:03:28,526
What?

627
01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:31,028
We gotta get these people
off the bus somehow.

628
01:03:31,112 --> 01:03:34,198
You know I can't.

629
01:03:34,282 --> 01:03:36,784
<i>What did he say? Jack?</i>

630
01:03:38,035 --> 01:03:40,538
Jack, what did he say?

631
01:03:42,123 --> 01:03:44,375
What's the matter?

632
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:53,385
- There's a gap in the freeway.
- What?

633
01:03:53,468 --> 01:03:56,388
<i>- What do you mean?
- How big is a gap?</i>

634
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:59,599
50 feet. A couple of miles ahead.

635
01:03:59,683 --> 01:04:01,768
<i>This is crazy.</i>

636
01:04:06,189 --> 01:04:08,692
<i>- Jeez.
- Jack.</i>

637
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:12,570
Jack. What if I shift into neutral
and just keep the engine revving?

638
01:04:12,653 --> 01:04:16,282
- No, he'd have thought of that.
- What, then? What? What?

639
01:04:17,074 --> 01:04:19,702
What? Jack?

640
01:04:19,785 --> 01:04:21,329
- Floor it.
- What?

641
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:24,749
Floor it. It's an interchange.
There might be an incline.

642
01:04:24,832 --> 01:04:26,584
Fine.

643
01:04:29,378 --> 01:04:33,090
Everybody hold onto your seats
or whatever you can.

644
01:04:33,174 --> 01:04:36,260
When we hit the gap, heads down.

645
01:04:36,344 --> 01:04:38,679
That's it? That's it?

646
01:04:38,763 --> 01:04:43,893
That's all we can do. Let's put these
underneath your seat, all right?

647
01:04:43,976 --> 01:04:46,479
Put your bags underneath the seat.

648
01:04:50,983 --> 01:04:54,612
- Hey, I didn't mean to shoot the guy.
- Hold on.

649
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:58,616
Is this really gonna work?

650
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:00,034
<i>Jack.</i>

651
01:05:02,203 --> 01:05:04,497
Yeah?

652
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,666
Jack.

653
01:05:26,936 --> 01:05:30,439
<i>- Come on, come on, come on.
- Oh, God.</i>

654
01:05:30,523 --> 01:05:32,817
- Come on!
- Oh, God.

655
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:43,286
Oh, shit.

656
01:05:56,717 --> 01:05:59,468
Everybody hold on!

657
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,738
Oh, God. Jack.

658
01:06:25,036 --> 01:06:27,121
<i>Shit!</i>

659
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:52,940
Yes! We are way out of control!

660
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:01,740
- You OK?
- Yeah.

661
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:03,408
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

662
01:07:03,492 --> 01:07:06,745
All right! Norwood, let's go!

663
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:09,706
- Is everybody OK?
- Yes!

664
01:07:12,876 --> 01:07:14,878
<i>We did it!</i>

665
01:07:14,962 --> 01:07:17,172
We made it.

666
01:07:17,255 --> 01:07:19,925
You're the man. You are the man!

667
01:07:20,592 --> 01:07:22,678
Thank you. Thank you very much.

668
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,223
Oh, shit.

669
01:07:26,306 --> 01:07:30,394
- I think you missed your calling.
- Yeah? What was it?

670
01:07:30,477 --> 01:07:33,188
Watch the road.
You should have been a pilot.

671
01:07:33,271 --> 01:07:34,314
Ow.

672
01:07:41,071 --> 01:07:42,321
- Get off.
- What?

673
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:44,490
Get off this. Now. Get off this.

674
01:07:50,663 --> 01:07:52,373
In there.

675
01:07:52,456 --> 01:07:54,375
- Where? Right here?
- Yeah.

676
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:55,876
- Right here?
- Yeah.

677
01:08:11,892 --> 01:08:15,521
- He's just entered the airport.
- There's thousands of people there.

678
01:08:15,605 --> 01:08:18,941
That's my boy Jack. He can circle
the runways and buy us some time.

679
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:23,863
- Choppers can't fly there. It's restricted.
- He's headed for the end of the field.

680
01:08:23,946 --> 01:08:28,284
- Bravo Tango, an emergency runway.
- Let's hope it's built. Let's move!

681
01:08:41,547 --> 01:08:44,091
We're at the airport.

682
01:08:44,175 --> 01:08:46,260
Yeah? So?

683
01:08:47,303 --> 01:08:49,388
I already seen the airport.

684
01:09:10,368 --> 01:09:14,206
- Yeah?
- Very, very exciting, Jack.

685
01:09:14,289 --> 01:09:18,543
Some close calls, huh?
But you've done all right for yourself.

686
01:09:18,627 --> 01:09:21,838
- What do you want?
- I want money, Jack.

687
01:09:21,922 --> 01:09:28,094
I wish I had some loftier purpose, but
I'm afraid in the end it's just the money, Jack.

688
01:09:28,177 --> 01:09:35,351
I would like large non-sequential bills
in two clear plastic bags, unmarked.

689
01:09:35,434 --> 01:09:39,230
- Can you remember all that?
- What are you telling me for?

690
01:09:39,313 --> 01:09:42,566
Because I want you to help me
to get it before it gets too late.

691
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:46,529
I hate negotiators, Jack. They talk to you
like they're your best friend

692
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:48,698
and they don't even know you.

693
01:09:48,781 --> 01:09:53,202
Why are they messing with me, huh?
Do they think I'm doing this for fun?

694
01:09:53,286 --> 01:09:56,706
<i>- Aren't you?
- Oh, that's unfair, Jack.</i>

695
01:09:56,789 --> 01:10:01,211
You don't know how I feel about this.
You don't even know me.

696
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:03,714
You want a shitload of money
you didn't earn.

697
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:06,008
Oh, I earned it.

698
01:10:06,091 --> 01:10:08,343
I spent my life earning it.

699
01:10:08,427 --> 01:10:14,057
<i>I got a medal, too, Jack, a medal and
a pink slip and a "sorry about your hand".</i>

700
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:17,352
- You have to let me off.
- Oh, no.

701
01:10:17,436 --> 01:10:20,314
- That's not good.
- You want me to help you?

702
01:10:20,397 --> 01:10:24,109
I need to talk to these people face to face.
They think you're bullshit.

703
01:10:24,192 --> 01:10:26,278
They don't think that.

704
01:10:26,361 --> 01:10:31,074
Look, you want the money, I don't want
anyone else to die. Let me get on the ground.

705
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:34,244
Just me. That's not against the rules.

706
01:10:34,328 --> 01:10:36,455
All right. I want you back real fast.

707
01:10:37,789 --> 01:10:39,166
Fine.

708
01:10:39,249 --> 01:10:43,045
<i>Jack, nothing tricky now.
You know that I'm on top of you.</i>

709
01:10:43,128 --> 01:10:46,048
Do not attempt to grow a brain.

710
01:10:55,349 --> 01:10:59,061
- So I guess there's a plan now?
- Could be.

711
01:10:59,144 --> 01:11:01,313
- Yeah?
- He's letting me off.

712
01:11:01,396 --> 01:11:04,650
- What?
- Just keep circling. You'll be fine.

713
01:11:06,401 --> 01:11:10,197
- Sit tight. I'm getting off for a minute.
- Do you think that's a good idea?

714
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,990
- It'll be OK.
- Are you just gonna leave us here?

715
01:11:13,074 --> 01:11:16,369
- I would.
- Don't worry. I won't go far.

716
01:11:16,452 --> 01:11:19,997
Hey. Don't forget about us.

717
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:37,890
The choppers are gone.
Let's dump the passengers.

718
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:40,393
- He's ready for that.
- How is that possible?

719
01:11:40,476 --> 01:11:44,647
I don't know how. I just know he is.
He's been a step ahead every time.

720
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:47,984
- If we unload, he'll take them out.
- So where does that put us?

721
01:11:48,067 --> 01:11:50,361
I have to try and dismantle that bomb.

722
01:11:50,695 --> 01:11:53,323
After an incredible ride on the 10 freeway,

723
01:11:53,407 --> 01:11:55,993
the streets of Los Angeles
and the 105 freeway,

724
01:11:56,076 --> 01:12:01,707
this bus has ended up here at Los Angeles
International Airport, circling the runway.

725
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:16,138
I'm telling you, he's somewhere jerking off.

726
01:12:16,221 --> 01:12:20,017
He didn't have to get
on the bus in the first place, Ortiz.

727
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,352
Get your ass behind the yellow line.

728
01:12:25,772 --> 01:12:28,275
What is that?

729
01:12:31,612 --> 01:12:33,697
<i>I have no idea.</i>

730
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:39,536
We won't be able to hold this steady for long.

731
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:44,124
I just need a few minutes.
If I can't do it by then, I can't do it at all.

732
01:12:44,207 --> 01:12:47,586
<i>- Harry, you with me?
- Yeah. You be careful, Jack.</i>

733
01:12:52,174 --> 01:12:56,011
What's he doing? Oh, my God. He is insane.

734
01:13:02,058 --> 01:13:05,895
OK, Jack, this is it. Don't get dead.

735
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,870
- This is not a very good plan.
- Have faith, sister.

736
01:13:22,954 --> 01:13:23,955
Oh, Christ.

737
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:36,592
Just keep it steady.

738
01:13:36,676 --> 01:13:39,178
Thank you for the tip, Ortiz.

739
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:53,901
<i>This guy is nuts!</i>

740
01:13:53,985 --> 01:13:57,196
We'll try to bypass the remote current
with the battery.

741
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,951
- Can you find the tripwire for the remote?
- I don't know. I got a few choices here.

742
01:14:02,034 --> 01:14:04,787
<i>- Black and red?
- And green.</i>

743
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:09,250
OK, I'm gonna guess he's not gonna go
with standard copper for the remote.

744
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:11,752
That'd be too weak. I'd use a fibre alloy.

745
01:14:11,836 --> 01:14:14,964
<i>Jack, I'm gonna need you to look at the wire.</i>

746
01:14:17,301 --> 01:14:18,552
Harry, it's covered.

747
01:14:18,635 --> 01:14:22,472
I know. You're gonna have to cut off
the sheath. But don't cut the wire.

748
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:25,142
Right.

749
01:14:37,155 --> 01:14:39,240
Fuck me!

750
01:14:40,575 --> 01:14:42,659
<i>Shit!</i>

751
01:14:47,748 --> 01:14:49,082
<i>- Bull's-eye!
- Great.</i>

752
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:52,753
OK. I want you to clip on the battery
and then run it to the lead wire.

753
01:14:52,836 --> 01:14:53,837
<i>Copy.</i>

754
01:15:11,063 --> 01:15:13,106
I can't bypass. It'll fire.

755
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:15,692
Oh, shit! It's a collapsible circuit.

756
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:22,741
Howard Payne, Atlanta PD Bomb Squad.
Retired in Sun Valley in 1989

757
01:15:22,824 --> 01:15:26,203
when a small charge left him
with fingers numbering nine.

758
01:15:26,286 --> 01:15:29,706
That's our scumbag!
We got him. Jack, we found him.

759
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,585
- We can get to his place inside of 15 minutes.
- Jack, get out of there.

760
01:15:33,669 --> 01:15:36,296
- We're going after the source.
- Watch your back.

761
01:15:38,298 --> 01:15:39,383
Wait for me!

762
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:42,552
Mac, get me outta here.

763
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:58,777
Somebody go to the back and check
and see if he came out the back. Go!

764
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:12,666
<i>- Can you see him?
- He's not behind us.</i>

765
01:16:12,749 --> 01:16:14,876
- What?
- He's not back here.

766
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,378
Oh, my God. Go look!

767
01:16:16,461 --> 01:16:20,841
Lay down and look under the bus
and see if you can see him down there.

768
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:23,635
- Can you see him?
- No.

769
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:26,679
You don't see him
back by the tyre or something?

770
01:16:26,762 --> 01:16:28,973
- I can't see him.
- Are you sure?

771
01:16:29,056 --> 01:16:30,474
I can't see him.

772
01:16:52,872 --> 01:16:56,626
Oh, my God! We hit him!
Oh, my God! Do you see him?

773
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:59,629
<i>- Did we hit him?
- Look out the sides.</i>

774
01:17:07,011 --> 01:17:10,139
- My tools!
- Will somebody get him his tools?!

775
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,613
<i>Please help him! Hurry!</i>

776
01:17:25,322 --> 01:17:28,075
God, we're dragging him. Do you see him?

777
01:17:28,784 --> 01:17:31,036
Where is he? Is he there?

778
01:17:32,704 --> 01:17:36,541
<i>- Do you see him?
- Jack! Jack!</i>

779
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:38,877
- I see him!
- What?

780
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:41,296
- I see him!
- You do? Is he OK?

781
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:45,008
<i>He's all right! He's all right!</i>

782
01:17:45,092 --> 01:17:48,470
Hold my legs. Hold my legs.
Somebody hold my legs.

783
01:17:48,553 --> 01:17:50,639
Hold his legs.

784
01:17:51,056 --> 01:17:53,225
<i>- Hold his legs!
- Come on!</i>

785
01:17:55,102 --> 01:17:57,312
Come on! I got ya!

786
01:18:01,733 --> 01:18:06,363
<i>- Is he hurt? Is he OK?
- Pull! Pull!</i>

787
01:18:06,446 --> 01:18:08,532
Come on! Come on!

788
01:18:08,615 --> 01:18:10,993
We got him now. Come on, pull!

789
01:18:12,118 --> 01:18:14,078
Jesus. I can't believe it.

790
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,333
You are a complete jerk. You know that?

791
01:18:21,168 --> 01:18:24,839
- Did you have any luck with the bomb?
- Yeah. It didn't go off.

792
01:18:26,424 --> 01:18:27,591
<i>Ortiz, thanks.</i>

793
01:18:27,675 --> 01:18:30,761
How many lives you got, man?

794
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:36,852
<i>You're not too bright, man,
but you got some big, round, hairy cojones.</i>

795
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,024
That's... very gross, Ortiz.

796
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,902
Can't even pay him a compliment.

797
01:18:46,987 --> 01:18:50,198
- How you doing?
- You scared the shit out of me, Jack!

798
01:18:50,282 --> 01:18:52,534
Other than that, I'm fine.

799
01:18:52,618 --> 01:18:56,204
- What is that smell?
- It's gas.

800
01:18:56,288 --> 01:18:58,790
- We're leaking gas?
- We are now.

801
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:05,964
You felt you needed
another challenge or something?

802
01:19:06,048 --> 01:19:08,967
<i>- Mac.
- Mac here. Go ahead.</i>

803
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:11,762
Can you get a fuel truck to pace us?
We're losing gas.

804
01:19:11,845 --> 01:19:17,392
- I'll see what I can find. How much time?
- 10 minutes? It doesn't look good.

805
01:19:17,476 --> 01:19:21,563
Gotcha. Norwood, get a fuel car
out here on the double.

806
01:19:21,647 --> 01:19:24,399
Is that gonna work?

807
01:19:24,483 --> 01:19:26,985
I don't know.

808
01:19:30,155 --> 01:19:31,531
Harry, save my life.

809
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:07,586
Harry, tell me good news, man.

810
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:10,505
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. He didn't make it.

811
01:21:12,924 --> 01:21:14,551
You fuck!

812
01:21:16,345 --> 01:21:20,599
It was the watch that led him
to me, wasn't it? Huh?

813
01:21:20,682 --> 01:21:25,228
It seemed a little hammy to me to build
the bomb out of my precious retirement gift,

814
01:21:25,312 --> 01:21:31,026
but, you know, I figured a sign that said
"Howard Payne" would be pushing it.

815
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:36,406
I'm gonna rip your fucking spine out,
I swear to God.

816
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:39,409
You're gonna do exactly as you're told.

817
01:21:39,493 --> 01:21:43,579
<i>Jack, we both know that he was the brains
of your particular operation.</i>

818
01:21:43,663 --> 01:21:46,582
You can't beat me.
You're gonna pay me every dollar.

819
01:21:46,666 --> 01:21:51,379
Otherwise, you, the wildcat
and every innocent person on that bus

820
01:21:51,462 --> 01:21:54,382
are gonna end up just like your friend.

821
01:21:55,299 --> 01:21:59,261
Are you paying attention?
Jack, are you listening to me?

822
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:03,683
- Jack? Jack?
- Yeah.

823
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:08,729
Good. You tell them that
the drop point is Pershing Square.

824
01:22:10,147 --> 01:22:13,192
There's a garbage can
on the northeast corner.

825
01:22:13,276 --> 01:22:15,820
You drop the bags and leave.

826
01:22:15,903 --> 01:22:18,823
<i>I don't show until all your people are gone.</i>

827
01:22:19,699 --> 01:22:27,248
It's getting on to 11am, Jack, and I think
it's gonna be a very pretty day.

828
01:22:36,967 --> 01:22:40,721
<i>Jack.</i>

829
01:22:40,804 --> 01:22:45,350
Come on. Don't give up on me, Jack!
Jack, stop it! Jack, come on!

830
01:22:45,434 --> 01:22:48,688
Stop it, OK? Don't give up
on me right now, all right?

831
01:22:51,274 --> 01:22:56,654
We're really scared and we need you
right now. I can't do this by myself. Please?

832
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:58,823
Jack, please.

833
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:06,247
OK? Please. All right?

834
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:15,840
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not. We got this far, OK?

835
01:23:38,236 --> 01:23:40,322
I'll be damned.

836
01:23:44,076 --> 01:23:47,537
Did you go to the University of Arizona?

837
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:49,998
- Yeah? So?
- Good football team.

838
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:53,752
Yeah, I guess so. I don't really know.

839
01:23:53,835 --> 01:23:55,671
Arizona Wildcats.

840
01:23:57,798 --> 01:24:00,258
- Right.
- He can see you.

841
01:24:00,342 --> 01:24:04,262
- What?
- He can see you.

842
01:24:04,346 --> 01:24:07,266
Just keep looking straight ahead.

843
01:24:22,948 --> 01:24:26,868
He called you a wildcat before.
Bastard's got a camera right in your face.

844
01:24:26,952 --> 01:24:30,163
He can see the whole bus.
He's been playing me from minute one.

845
01:24:30,247 --> 01:24:34,626
- Well, he can see me, but can he hear me?
- Doesn't look like it. He's just watching.

846
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:40,048
<i>We are following the progress
of what is turning out to be a harrowing story,</i>

847
01:24:40,132 --> 01:24:43,176
<i>as a city bus,
rigged to explode if it slows down,</i>

848
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,513
<i>races around literally in circles
at the Los Angeles airport.</i>

849
01:24:46,596 --> 01:24:51,476
<i>The dead are a female passenger and a driver
of another bus, both blown up by the bomber.</i>

850
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:57,399
<i>Others in jeopardy are the passengers of the
bus, held hostage at the whim of a madman.</i>

851
01:24:59,151 --> 01:25:01,653
"The whim of a madman."

852
01:25:02,237 --> 01:25:03,697
I like that.

853
01:25:04,448 --> 01:25:07,743
There's a camera on the bus
just over my left shoulder.

854
01:25:07,826 --> 01:25:10,828
I want you to stare straight ahead.

855
01:25:10,911 --> 01:25:14,458
Don't make any big movements, OK?

856
01:25:16,001 --> 01:25:17,836
It's Jack.

857
01:25:17,919 --> 01:25:20,005
Yeah, I know about Harry.

858
01:25:22,549 --> 01:25:24,468
Is that news van still around?

859
01:25:24,885 --> 01:25:27,804
- Get those cameras to stop taping.
- Right.

860
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:32,184
LAPD. I need this unit.
You can broadcast UHF, right?

861
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:35,729
There's a signal going to that bus.
I want you to find it.

862
01:25:35,812 --> 01:25:38,732
<i>We're gonna have to
take you off the air.</i>

863
01:25:38,815 --> 01:25:41,068
Please, sir, stop taping.

864
01:25:41,151 --> 01:25:44,446
Come on, hurry up. Good! Tape off of that.

865
01:25:48,033 --> 01:25:51,578
Remember, no big movements.
Just look whipped.

866
01:25:51,662 --> 01:25:54,373
That ain't gonna be too hard.

867
01:26:05,759 --> 01:26:08,679
- Tape it. Good. Come on, tape it.
- It's taping!

868
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:20,524
- Jack.
- Yeah?

869
01:26:20,607 --> 01:26:22,693
Look.

870
01:26:26,196 --> 01:26:29,283
- Mac, fuel.
- Jack, five minutes.

871
01:26:29,616 --> 01:26:32,411
Not enough time. Run the tape.
We have to unload.

872
01:26:32,494 --> 01:26:35,163
<i>- I only have a minute of tape.
- Do it now.</i>

873
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:39,084
I want you to make a tape and loop it
so that it runs over and over, OK?

874
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,717
- All right, run it. Run it!
- All right. Tape's rolling.

875
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:52,055
<i>We still have no live picture, but reports
are that the bus continues to circle...</i>

876
01:26:53,849 --> 01:26:57,226
<i>Everyone is safe for the moment.</i>

877
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:01,063
<i>Hard to imagine what's going
through their thoughts at this time.</i>

878
01:27:01,147 --> 01:27:03,482
<i>Certainly, a sense of community...</i>

879
01:27:21,668 --> 01:27:24,921
Rig the steering wheel and the gas pedal.

880
01:27:27,341 --> 01:27:30,052
All right, let's get 'em off.

881
01:27:30,135 --> 01:27:32,179
OK, you, you, and you.

882
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:38,518
<i>Police have just issued a general
statement, which doesn't tell us much more...</i>

883
01:27:38,602 --> 01:27:42,064
Grab my wrist. That's it. Good.

884
01:27:42,147 --> 01:27:44,650
Come on. Look straight ahead.

885
01:28:03,628 --> 01:28:07,131
- That's good, that's good.
- Grab my wrist.

886
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:09,467
Put your hand out. Take his hand.

887
01:28:22,021 --> 01:28:23,982
Come on, buddy. I got ya.

888
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:26,901
<i>Give me your hand. Your hand.</i>

889
01:28:28,695 --> 01:28:31,531
<i>Grab my hand. Don't look down.</i>

890
01:28:34,367 --> 01:28:36,327
Shit!

891
01:28:36,661 --> 01:28:38,997
Jack!

892
01:28:40,872 --> 01:28:43,917
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

893
01:28:51,842 --> 01:28:54,177
Jack! Jack, I can't hold this any more.

894
01:28:54,845 --> 01:28:56,596
Annie!

895
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,015
You... hold on!

896
01:29:01,893 --> 01:29:03,979
No! No! No!

897
01:29:06,273 --> 01:29:07,399
<i>Hold it.</i>

898
01:29:14,448 --> 01:29:18,160
- Oh, God.
- Wedge down the gas pedal.

899
01:29:21,663 --> 01:29:23,749
OK, I got it.

900
01:29:34,301 --> 01:29:37,012
- You got it?
- Yeah. I got it.

901
01:29:45,812 --> 01:29:48,815
- OK, Annie, get on.
- Jack, I can't do this.

902
01:29:49,942 --> 01:29:53,362
<i>- Let's go! Let's go!
- Shit. Shit.</i>

903
01:29:55,322 --> 01:29:56,907
- Jack.
- Shit!

904
01:29:58,492 --> 01:30:00,077
Hold on.

905
01:31:25,872 --> 01:31:27,957
Shit!

906
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:36,549
Are you all right?

907
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:39,969
No.

908
01:31:40,053 --> 01:31:43,306
It's OK. It's OK. It's over.

909
01:31:44,015 --> 01:31:47,936
It's over. You did it. You did it.

910
01:31:52,982 --> 01:31:55,485
I hate the airport.

911
01:32:01,324 --> 01:32:04,661
You're not gonna get mushy on me, are you?

912
01:32:04,744 --> 01:32:08,122
Maybe. I might.

913
01:32:10,457 --> 01:32:15,087
I hope not, cos relationships that start
under intense circumstances never last.

914
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:18,423
- Oh, yeah?
- I've done extensive studying on this.

915
01:32:19,341 --> 01:32:21,385
Here comes the cavalry.

916
01:32:37,484 --> 01:32:39,987
- How ya doing?
- We're OK.

917
01:32:42,114 --> 01:32:45,659
I just might be a nice guy
and let you have the rest of the day off.

918
01:32:45,742 --> 01:32:47,786
Oh, boy.

919
01:32:47,869 --> 01:32:50,622
Mac, this is Annie.

920
01:32:50,706 --> 01:32:53,875
Annie, meet Lieutenant McMahon.

921
01:32:53,959 --> 01:32:56,044
- How you doing?
- OK.

922
01:32:56,378 --> 01:32:59,548
- This should take care of it.
- Ow!

923
01:32:59,631 --> 01:33:02,718
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

924
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:06,179
- We're gonna have you guys checked out.
- Lieutenant!

925
01:33:07,806 --> 01:33:10,642
It's him. He wants to know
when he's gonna get his money.

926
01:33:10,726 --> 01:33:13,688
I'll tell him what to do
with his goddamn money.

927
01:33:13,771 --> 01:33:16,274
He doesn't know it blew up.

928
01:33:19,611 --> 01:33:20,987
30 minutes.

929
01:34:01,151 --> 01:34:03,236
I'll be right back.

930
01:34:06,156 --> 01:34:12,037
All right, here's our target. Fox, I want you
in 4-1, you in 1-2. You're in 3. Let's move it.

931
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:15,415
- Is the paint bomb in with the money?
- It's done, sir.

932
01:35:15,684 --> 01:35:18,604
Too bad, Jack.
You could've made a good cop.

933
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:23,317
OK.

934
01:35:24,901 --> 01:35:31,491
<i>We still have no live picture. Reports are
that the bus continues to circle inside LAX.</i>

935
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:42,002
No! No!

936
01:36:05,902 --> 01:36:08,947
Miss, you can't be this close.
You need to move back.

937
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:10,531
No. Jack Traven said...

938
01:36:10,615 --> 01:36:15,036
Jack Traven asked that you be brought
out of harm's way. Just move right over here.

939
01:36:15,912 --> 01:36:19,040
- He's running a little late.
- He's not late.

940
01:36:20,583 --> 01:36:23,419
- What?
- He's never late.

941
01:36:23,503 --> 01:36:26,005
Well, that money hasn't moved.

942
01:36:26,089 --> 01:36:31,094
We got 200 eyes on that can, a bird dog
in the bag. I'd say he's covered.

943
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,017
- Turn it on.
- What for? It hasn't moved.

944
01:36:38,101 --> 01:36:40,186
Just do it.

945
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:50,530
<i>Shit. It's moving.
He's got the money.</i>

946
01:36:50,613 --> 01:36:52,699
Jack!

947
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:03,793
Shit!

948
01:37:20,727 --> 01:37:22,854
Freeze!

949
01:37:22,937 --> 01:37:26,565
Pop quiz, asshole.
You have a hair trigger aimed at your head.

950
01:37:26,648 --> 01:37:30,444
What do you do? What do you do?

951
01:37:31,778 --> 01:37:35,699
Turn around. Turn around!

952
01:37:54,509 --> 01:37:57,638
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry.

953
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:01,892
Be prepared.

954
01:38:01,975 --> 01:38:04,728
It's the Boy Scout marching song.

955
01:38:04,811 --> 01:38:09,191
What are you gonna do, Jack?
I don't think you can shoot her.

956
01:38:09,274 --> 01:38:10,525
Let her go.

957
01:38:11,985 --> 01:38:14,613
No, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

958
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:17,324
Fill it. Now.

959
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:26,667
I think Harry would be very disappointed,
feeling that we're right back where we started.

960
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:30,462
Let her go. You don't need her.
You have the money. Take it and walk.

961
01:38:30,545 --> 01:38:34,050
Come on. Just take it and walk.
You don't need her.

962
01:38:34,133 --> 01:38:37,428
- Just take your goddamn money and walk!
- Stay right there.

963
01:38:37,512 --> 01:38:40,682
I'll do it. I'll let go. I'll let go.

964
01:38:40,765 --> 01:38:42,767
Oh, yeah.

965
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:47,438
You still don't get it, do you, Jack? Huh?
The beauty of it.

966
01:38:48,356 --> 01:38:53,361
A bomb is made to explode.
That's its meaning, its purpose.

967
01:38:53,444 --> 01:38:59,158
Your life is empty because you spend it
trying to stop the bomb from becoming.

968
01:38:59,993 --> 01:39:02,078
And for who? For what?

969
01:39:03,288 --> 01:39:06,958
Do you know what a bomb is, Jack,
that doesn't explode?

970
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:10,502
It is a cheap gold watch, buddy.

971
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:16,008
You're crazy. You're fucking crazy.

972
01:39:16,091 --> 01:39:19,261
No. Poor people are crazy, Jack.

973
01:39:19,344 --> 01:39:22,055
I'm eccentric. Get the money. Let's go.

974
01:39:22,139 --> 01:39:24,766
Come on! Let's go! Move it! Move it!

975
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:27,144
You stay! Move it! Move it!

976
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:29,730
In the door. In that door! Now!

977
01:39:31,648 --> 01:39:34,610
Bye, Jack. Punk.

978
01:39:38,655 --> 01:39:39,906
All right!

979
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:44,620
Get in there. Go on, get in.

980
01:39:45,329 --> 01:39:49,082
You get back in there!
You get this train moving! Go on!

981
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:52,670
Are these seats taken?

982
01:39:52,754 --> 01:39:54,088
No. Go.

983
01:39:57,216 --> 01:40:00,678
Come on. Back over here.
Hands around the pole.

984
01:40:21,783 --> 01:40:23,868
Damn.

985
01:40:42,303 --> 01:40:44,264
Come on, come on, come on!

986
01:40:50,186 --> 01:40:53,398
<i>Please report, Westbound 501.
What is your position?</i>

987
01:40:58,277 --> 01:41:01,196
<i>Westbound 501, please check in.</i>

988
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:08,620
<i>Westbound 501. We have police orders
to return to the station. Do you copy?</i>

989
01:41:08,704 --> 01:41:13,167
You have to hold this. It's like a grenade.
You have to help me now. Come on, hold it.

990
01:41:13,251 --> 01:41:16,838
Don't let it go. Huh? I'm counting on you.

991
01:41:16,921 --> 01:41:18,339
<i>Do you copy?</i>

992
01:41:18,423 --> 01:41:20,883
Hey! I'll take it from here.

993
01:41:29,434 --> 01:41:32,770
<i>Uh-oh. Uh-oh.</i>

994
01:41:32,854 --> 01:41:37,275
Maybe you'd better let me have this after all.
I'm afraid you're a bit hysterical

995
01:41:37,358 --> 01:41:39,902
and you might let this go a mite early.

996
01:41:43,072 --> 01:41:46,075
Hey! Hey, buckaroo!

997
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:48,578
It's not cos you're a woman, all right?

998
01:41:48,661 --> 01:41:52,999
Hey, it's all right. Looks like we're all alone.

999
01:41:53,082 --> 01:41:58,254
You won. You beat Jack. You beat everybody.
Just throw me off the train. I don't care.

1000
01:41:58,713 --> 01:42:02,008
This stick works on a remote.

1001
01:42:02,091 --> 01:42:06,346
When you explode, that's where they'll come,
but it's not where I'll be.

1002
01:42:06,429 --> 01:42:12,435
I have a different plan. Mess like that,
they don't even count body parts.

1003
01:42:12,518 --> 01:42:15,688
Gives me more time.

1004
01:42:15,772 --> 01:42:18,274
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.

1005
01:42:31,162 --> 01:42:33,665
Hey, Jack, is that you?

1006
01:42:35,792 --> 01:42:39,253
He's so persistent. He always gets his man.

1007
01:42:39,337 --> 01:42:43,131
Wouldn't be able
to interest you in a bribe, would I?

1008
01:42:43,215 --> 01:42:46,760
I've got plenty to go around.

1009
01:42:50,806 --> 01:42:52,641
My money!

1010
01:42:57,688 --> 01:43:01,066
You bastard! How does that feel?

1011
01:43:02,985 --> 01:43:06,655
You like that, huh? You like it, you bastard?

1012
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:12,911
My money!

1013
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,545
Shit!

1014
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:24,881
You! I'm coming for you, Jack!

1015
01:43:54,621 --> 01:43:57,749
Hey, I'll drop the stick, boy. You want that?

1016
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:01,753
I'm gonna get you.

1017
01:44:01,836 --> 01:44:03,129
Oh, yes!

1018
01:44:16,435 --> 01:44:20,689
What do you do, Jack? What do you do?
You're so smart, right, Jack?

1019
01:44:20,773 --> 01:44:26,069
You piece of shit! I'm the guy
with the plan cos I'm smarter than you.

1020
01:44:26,152 --> 01:44:28,237
I'm smarter than you.

1021
01:44:42,168 --> 01:44:43,628
Yeah.

1022
01:44:45,088 --> 01:44:46,839
But I'm taller.

1023
01:44:48,633 --> 01:44:49,842
Jack.

1024
01:44:50,718 --> 01:44:51,761
Jack!

1025
01:44:51,844 --> 01:44:54,597
Oh, God! I thought you were dead. Jack.

1026
01:44:57,183 --> 01:45:00,186
- Turn around.
- Where's Payne?

1027
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:02,855
He lost his head.

1028
01:45:04,274 --> 01:45:06,651
Oh, God.

1029
01:45:06,734 --> 01:45:10,697
- Let's take this off, shall we?
- Yes. Let's take this off.

1030
01:45:13,533 --> 01:45:16,536
<i>- Take it off.
- Hello? Hello?</i>

1031
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:21,416
<i>Does anyone copy?
Jack, this is Mac. Can you hear me?</i>

1032
01:45:23,001 --> 01:45:28,172
<i>Jack, if you're there, you've got to stop
the train. The track isn't finished.</i>

1033
01:45:28,256 --> 01:45:30,967
<i>Mac, I copy.</i>

1034
01:45:31,718 --> 01:45:34,095
<i>- Mac.
- If someone can hear me...</i>

1035
01:45:34,178 --> 01:45:39,475
<i>- Mac, can you hear me?
- Try the emergency brake. Do you copy?</i>

1036
01:45:41,686 --> 01:45:44,981
Nothing works! Annie, you won't believe this.

1037
01:45:45,064 --> 01:45:47,191
What?

1038
01:45:47,275 --> 01:45:49,319
We have to jump.

1039
01:45:49,402 --> 01:45:51,487
You can't stop it?

1040
01:45:54,032 --> 01:45:58,661
Well, OK, undo me,
and I'd love to go with you. Come on.

1041
01:46:00,288 --> 01:46:02,457
- I don't have a key.
- What?

1042
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:04,626
I don't have the key.

1043
01:46:25,437 --> 01:46:26,563
Shit.

1044
01:46:44,123 --> 01:46:46,960
You gotta get off... You gotta get off the train.

1045
01:46:47,043 --> 01:46:51,422
Jack, please! This track dead-ends.
You gotta get off this train. This is crazy.

1046
01:46:51,506 --> 01:46:53,716
There's a curve ahead.

1047
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,387
I'm gonna speed it up, make itjump the track.

1048
01:46:57,470 --> 01:47:01,099
This is really stupid.
Jack, please. You can still jump.

1049
01:47:01,432 --> 01:47:04,560
Jack, please. Please, Jack?

1050
01:49:45,096 --> 01:49:49,684
I can't believe he hit my van.
Come on. It's all right.

1051
01:49:49,767 --> 01:49:50,727
Unreal.

1052
01:49:53,479 --> 01:49:55,690
You didn't leave me.

1053
01:49:55,773 --> 01:49:58,443
I can't believe it.

1054
01:50:00,194 --> 01:50:02,739
You didn't leave me.

1055
01:50:02,822 --> 01:50:05,199
Didn't have anywhere to be just then.

1056
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:13,124
Check it out.

1057
01:50:18,796 --> 01:50:21,257
I have to warn you.

1058
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:25,678
I've heard relationships
based on intense experiences never work.

1059
01:50:25,762 --> 01:50:28,097
OK.

1060
01:50:28,181 --> 01:50:31,142
We'll have to base it on sex, then.

1061
01:50:31,225 --> 01:50:33,728
Whatever you say, ma'am.
