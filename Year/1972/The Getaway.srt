1
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,277
<i>I think we can begin.</i>

2
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:11,274
<i>The first parole request</i>
<i>for Carter "Doc" McCoy.</i>

3
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:12,819
<i>Is legal counsel present?</i>

4
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:16,034
Yes, sir. I'm Eugene Stewart,
representing Mr. McCoy.

5
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:25,464
<i>" Carter McCoy, one to ten year sentence</i>
<i>for armed robbery.</i>

6
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:28,585
<i>" First offense in the state of Texas.</i>

7
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:31,836
"Wanted by the state of Ohio
for assault with a deadly weapon...

8
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,087
<i>"...and armed robbery."</i>

9
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:36,387
The State of Ohio has waived jurisdiction,
Mr. Chairman.

10
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:39,523
<i>Mr. McCoy is no longer wanted</i>
<i>in that case.</i>

11
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:44,725
Good luck, man.

12
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,100
<i>Mr. McCoy has served</i>
<i>four years of his sentence.</i>

13
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:48,942
<i>His record's satisfactory.</i>

14
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:52,535
<i>Applied for parole</i>
<i>on September fifth of this year.</i>

15
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:55,858
<i>Remarks?</i>

16
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:58,485
I would only, once again,
like to point out to the committee...

17
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:01,154
...Mr. McCoy's good behavior
while a prisoner.

18
00:02:01,258 --> 00:02:03,368
- Notice is taken.
- Thank you, sir.

19
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:06,037
The board met
in closed chambers last week.

20
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:10,165
Have you reached a decision regarding
Mr. McCoy's request for parole?

21
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,219
Request for parole is denied.

22
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:15,800
The prisoner may re-apply
after one calendar year.

23
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:38,052
Lock 'em up.

24
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:33,236
<i>Open the gate.</i>

25
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:50,458
Lance said to have eight hole,
Gallo one, Kirksky two.

26
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:52,672
Eight hole colored.

27
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:56,791
Go down to the garden house,
turn to your left, go to the woods.

28
00:04:56,968 --> 00:05:01,215
<i>We're going on to the brush. Burn it.</i>
<i>Take the stumps up out of the ground.</i>

29
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:04,634
Bob Field, get them dogs out there
close to the trailer.

30
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:25,200
One hole.

31
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,502
Eight hole.

32
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:45,016
Thirty.

33
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:46,560
Thirty.

34
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,062
Come on.

35
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:51,851
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

36
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:57,767
Get them dogs in close to 'em, Bob Field.

37
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,048
- Thirty.
- Thirty.

38
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:32,131
Hogfield, you go to the left
and start rounding up on that brush pile.

39
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:33,428
Time to go.

40
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:37,308
<i>Put it back. Catch them, this squad.</i>

41
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:41,150
<i>Round this pile up and get it burning.</i>

42
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:46,741
Oh, man, that's just a game.

43
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:51,990
Man, get on this stump.

44
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,042
Look out, McCoy.

45
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:58,338
Get your axe and come on up here
and pitch in.

46
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:03,042
Go to work. Go to work.

47
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:11,763
<i>De Leon, get the fire going.</i>

48
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,764
That Mexican there...

49
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:17,981
Get up all this little stuff
and put it on this pile.

50
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,196
Thirty.

51
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:23,609
Eight hole.

52
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,616
Catch that brush pile here
and get it rounded up.

53
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:30,989
I want it tight to where it'll burn.
Get these stumps down under the ground.

54
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:35,072
Bob Field...

55
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,084
<i>...round up that pile.</i>

56
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:40,082
<i>Get it to burn.</i>
<i>Kirk Shaw, over on the ground...</i>

57
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,880
Keep that line straight.

58
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:54,059
<i>Keep that line tight.</i>

59
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:49,776
Hello, Doc.

60
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:00,824
I'm sorry.

61
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,408
Get to Beynon.

62
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,915
Tell him I'm for sale. His price.

63
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:13,712
Do it now.

64
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:28,402
Hello, Mrs. McCoy.

65
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:31,071
I'd like to see Jack Beynon.

66
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:36,901
Go ahead.

67
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,321
Class. Is she a regular?

68
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,577
No. Doc McCoy's old lady.

69
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:47,616
Jeez, is that Carol Ainsley?

70
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,043
Shut up!

71
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:54,254
How are you, Mrs. McCoy?

72
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:58,671
Ready to talk about my husband,
Mr. Beynon.

73
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:02,770
Please sit down.

74
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:09,691
So the good doctor comes up again.

75
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:14,899
He asked me to come and see you.

76
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:17,493
Why?

77
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:20,701
Can I help?

78
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,041
Yes, I think you can.

79
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,626
How about a drink?

80
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,425
Yeah, I could use one.

81
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,715
Come on over.

82
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,078
You'll be back, Doc.

83
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:42,661
Mr. Beynon will see you
the day after tomorrow.

84
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,118
12:30 at the River Walk.

85
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,960
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi.

86
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,340
Feel okay?

87
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,717
I'm a lot better off now
than I was an hour ago.

88
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,430
- You want to drive?
- My driver's license has expired.

89
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,559
Sorry I'm late. I was having my hair done,
the girl was slow.

90
00:12:58,663 --> 00:12:59,934
You look fine.

91
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,823
- You feel good?
- Yeah.

92
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,826
- Where do you want to go?
- Take a walk.

93
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,437
What do you want for dinner?

94
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,856
Drinks. Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey...

95
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:37,317
You okay?

96
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:39,944
Pretty good.

97
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:43,318
Made a trip to Oregon
to see my brother and his kids.

98
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:45,321
I figured it'd be
the last time I'd see them...

99
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,543
...unless they decide to travel.

100
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,167
How's Estelle?

101
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,670
Fatter.

102
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,877
You know, some things never change.

103
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,092
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:02,096
That's not all of it.

105
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,105
It's been a long time, Doc.

106
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,066
Did you go out much?

107
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,357
Four years, and now
the question comes up.

108
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:25,783
I couldn't handle it inside.

109
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,455
But I can now.

110
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:30,296
I'm still here, Doc.

111
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:11,887
It does something to you, you know.

112
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:14,982
It does something to you.

113
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:20,312
It does something to you in there.

114
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,069
We've got time, Doc.
We've got lots of time.

115
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,078
Just give me a minute, baby.

116
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:38,580
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.

117
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,048
Really?

118
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:43,506
Really.

119
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:49,216
Let me make you feel good, Doctor.

120
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:02,689
It's been so long.

121
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:06,236
So long.

122
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:29,380
Fantastic.

123
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:36,226
She's here.

124
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,352
Hey, I was gonna fix you breakfast.

125
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:43,811
You were sleeping.

126
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,317
A little ketchup.

127
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,239
And then we have a little...

128
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:01,835
Thank you.

129
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,168
- For what?
- For getting me out.

130
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,139
It was a pleasure.

131
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:21,942
Thank you, ma'am.

132
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:29,021
Hey, Claude. Here's your boy.

133
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:41,115
You have to be kidding.

134
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:44,463
Not at all.
Just a pleasant way to have lunch.

135
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,164
Sit down.

136
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,414
It's good to see you
in them civilian clothes.

137
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,637
It just takes a long arm, Beynon.

138
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:58,644
You know, it's hard to say
how those things happen.

139
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:02,975
The parole board almost never
changes their decision.

140
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:06,517
It must be because I'm a model prisoner.

141
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:11,491
This is the only time
you and I meet in public.

142
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,320
Any business with me...

143
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:16,649
...you handle it with him.

144
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,289
He's my brother.

145
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,659
Back with your own people, now.

146
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:23,793
I got you some professionals.

147
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:26,247
I'll get my own men, Beynon.

148
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,679
You run the job, but I run the show.

149
00:22:32,138 --> 00:22:33,632
And don't forget it.

150
00:22:39,353 --> 00:22:41,513
You've got two weeks to set it up.

151
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:46,694
It's not a big bank, but it handles
the cash deposits for an oil company.

152
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:49,604
Over half a million dollars.

153
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:52,275
It's a family bank.

154
00:22:52,908 --> 00:22:54,273
The brother of the bank director...

155
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:57,867
...is on the board of directors
at Con-Sol Oil in Beacon City.

156
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:08,375
Here's a couple of fellas
I'd like you to meet.

157
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,377
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson.

158
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:19,423
Yeah, I've heard of you.

159
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,096
You work with Miller?

160
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:23,479
You're out of touch, Doc.

161
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:25,517
Miller got blown up.

162
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:29,945
Where?

163
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:32,113
Fort Lauderdale.

164
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:34,865
- Were you with him?
- Yeah.

165
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:38,067
I got out.

166
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:40,663
You?

167
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,699
I was backup man on a payroll job.

168
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,030
I'd hit some liquor stores. I drive good.

169
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,243
I drive.

170
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,839
Sure.

171
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:55,298
I want Mexican visas and passports.

172
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:57,423
They'll be ready.

173
00:23:58,264 --> 00:24:00,008
You boys just do your job.

174
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:09,187
Carol.

175
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:12,027
Bank guard, 7:59.

176
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:13,602
He's early.

177
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:24,570
You got a flashlight, some light batteries.

178
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,961
A-hooks, pliers, wire cutters...

179
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,291
What do you want all this stuff for?

180
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:38,173
- I'm going on a picnic.
- Going on a picnic?

181
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,424
Well... okay.

182
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:50,978
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>especially you gentlemen...</i>

183
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:55,610
<i>We very proudly present</i>
<i>the pride and Joy of Beacon City.</i>

184
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:58,934
<i>Our own high-stepping and high-kicking...</i>

185
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,191
<i>...Southwest Texas Ropers.</i>

186
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:28,254
<i>Following the strutters...</i>
<i>representing the Ladies' Auxiliary</i> of...

187
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,648
<i>...the Volunteer Fire Brigade.</i>
<i>We have the first beautiful float...</i>

188
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:37,272
<i>...which consists of the Constitution</i>
<i>in the history of the Lone Star State.</i>

189
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,780
Good morning.

190
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:57,078
I'd like an application
for a checking account, please.

191
00:25:57,182 --> 00:26:00,998
He goes here, follows down here.
Now, this is the spot you're looking for.

192
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,340
Here. Yeah.

193
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:04,677
- Can I get a copy of this?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:16,232
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

195
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,089
Change for a $50, please.

196
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,380
$20, $30...

197
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,845
...$40, $45, $50.

198
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:54,724
Thank you.
Y'all come back and see us soon.

199
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,819
Set your clocks for five minutes after 9:00.

200
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,480
All right, on the nose, now.

201
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:07,521
The diversionary explosions are spaced
20 seconds apart.

202
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,029
That gives you...

203
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:12,414
...one minute and 38 seconds,
before they blow.

204
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:18,663
You've got a bank president,
you have three tellers.

205
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:21,663
And you've got a bank guard.

206
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,079
Usually on the right as you come in.

207
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,670
Pin him right away.

208
00:27:24,802 --> 00:27:27,590
Careful he doesn't panic,
and go shoot somebody.

209
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:32,057
You got one local police car.
Now he's a rover.

210
00:27:32,602 --> 00:27:35,715
Shouldn't be anywhere near the vicinity
when we make our hit.

211
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,883
Traffic is usually light at that hour.

212
00:27:37,987 --> 00:27:41,223
There are three exits. One at Hopkins,
one at Guadalupe Street...

213
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,972
...and then there's the alley.

214
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:45,608
Will you put that away and pay attention!

215
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:51,194
Now the guard carries a.38.

216
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:56,290
The cops carry 357-magnums.

217
00:27:59,962 --> 00:28:01,587
You know what this is.

218
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:05,587
This'll stop an M-2 army rifle at 50 yards.

219
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:11,254
I've been working ten years without one.

220
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,635
- Suit yourself.
- Thank you.

221
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:17,591
What about the vault?

222
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,926
It's a Chambers Reilly.

223
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,098
It's on a time lock.
Opens up 20 minutes before office hours.

224
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,203
Wire pull over?

225
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:26,065
No, one-inch stuff
on a three number combination.

226
00:28:26,197 --> 00:28:27,359
That's me.

227
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:31,280
No, no. I'll handle the fine stuff.
You're backup all the way.

228
00:28:32,702 --> 00:28:34,529
Whatever you need, brother.

229
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,445
Right.

230
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:42,626
You keep going over this.
I don't want anybody lost.

231
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:46,036
If we're clean,
Gollie will take us across at Laredo.

232
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,252
If we're hot, we'll have to try Laughlin's
in El Paso.

233
00:28:53,724 --> 00:28:55,882
Aren't we going a little bit hard?

234
00:29:01,648 --> 00:29:03,439
That's a walk-in bank, man.

235
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:05,396
A piece of cake.

236
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:10,240
You don't have to be Dillinger for that one.

237
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,830
Bang.

238
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,335
Dillinger got killed.

239
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:34,929
Not in the bank.

240
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:40,351
Take it with you.

241
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,447
Expenses.

242
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:12,083
Tell Beynon I don't want any mix-ups.
I make one phone call.

243
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,841
And his people better be there.
All of them.

244
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:19,304
I understand.

245
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:20,629
Beynon's to be alone at the drop.

246
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,718
Only one car in the garage
at the ranch and that's it.

247
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,299
Now, I'm not gonna have the money.

248
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:29,312
And she's not gonna know where it is
until I know I'm clear. Got it?

249
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:32,015
- He understands.
- Good, good.

250
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,401
Make sure everybody does. Okay?

251
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:30,369
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

252
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:34,915
Good morning.

253
00:31:35,884 --> 00:31:37,082
Good morning.

254
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:46,800
Good morning.

255
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:52,467
Good morning, Mr. Morgan. How are you?

256
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:53,895
Fine, thank you.

257
00:33:03,722 --> 00:33:04,764
Hold it.

258
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:28,703
Come on, move it!

259
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:06,361
Relax.

260
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:25,707
Superior technology, my ass.

261
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:39,315
Hands up!

262
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:48,365
Mr. President? Up!

263
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:56,200
Everybody, out this way.

264
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:04,587
Come on, come on! Hurry it up! Move it!

265
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:08,468
Go!

266
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:16,094
Come on, move it!

267
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:22,225
Come on, honey, get on it.

268
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:42,040
Now just relax.

269
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:43,957
Face down!

270
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:03,311
Move it. Move it, honey.

271
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:07,981
They're on their way. Just relax.

272
00:36:09,905 --> 00:36:11,315
Everybody relax.

273
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,244
Ninety seconds.

274
00:37:30,235 --> 00:37:31,278
Seventy-five.

275
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:37,654
Sixty-five.

276
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:42,318
Fifty, brother.

277
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:55,675
No!

278
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:56,926
No!

279
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:06,716
Stupid bastard!

280
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:27,779
Take the wheel.

281
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,531
Take the wheel.

282
00:38:58,738 --> 00:38:59,931
How did it go?

283
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,273
Bad. Jackson killed the guard.

284
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:12,079
Fourteen seconds till the next one goes off.

285
00:39:14,254 --> 00:39:16,246
Come on, come on.

286
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:12,311
Shit.

287
00:41:48,614 --> 00:41:49,944
Where's Jackson?

288
00:41:51,452 --> 00:41:52,910
He didn't make it.

289
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:54,823
Neither did you.

290
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,180
<i>...was held up this morning</i>
<i>shortly after opening.</i>

291
00:43:47,284 --> 00:43:51,686
<i>The bank officials state that $750,000</i>
<i>was taken by three masked men...</i>

292
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:53,066
<i>...who forced the employees...</i>

293
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,186
Hey, there's only $500,000 here.

294
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,239
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

295
00:44:00,495 --> 00:44:01,495
Doc?

296
00:44:02,122 --> 00:44:04,079
I see it. Take it easy.

297
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,746
They're looking for three men, remember?

298
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:23,973
What seems to be the problem, Officer?

299
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,221
Okay, drive on.

300
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,011
I'll kill him.

301
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,180
I'll kill that mother!

302
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:16,107
He's on.

303
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:18,854
I'm here.

304
00:45:20,575 --> 00:45:21,575
Yeah?

305
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,519
<i>Yeah?</i>

306
00:45:25,788 --> 00:45:26,867
I'm here.

307
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:43,680
They checked in.

308
00:45:56,986 --> 00:45:58,768
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.

309
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:00,523
I've never been there.

310
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:03,697
When we met, it was at his office.

311
00:46:09,415 --> 00:46:10,874
Do you trust him?

312
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:14,154
I don't figure he's gonna try to cross us.

313
00:46:14,258 --> 00:46:16,578
At least not until he gets his money.

314
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:19,959
Well, let's just send his cut back
and just get going.

315
00:46:22,594 --> 00:46:25,085
If we make a mistake, he's gonna burn us.

316
00:46:25,472 --> 00:46:28,169
You make a deal,
you're better off keeping up your end.

317
00:46:28,273 --> 00:46:30,057
I don't want to go there.

318
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:33,597
Let's do it my way.

319
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:13,557
Stay here.

320
00:47:15,523 --> 00:47:17,681
I'll wrap it up as quick as I can.

321
00:48:01,526 --> 00:48:03,435
News said two people killed.

322
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:06,019
Three. Rudy got ambitious.

323
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:07,900
And you got him.

324
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:10,268
That's right.

325
00:48:10,372 --> 00:48:12,028
What about your wife?

326
00:48:12,871 --> 00:48:14,108
Let's cut up the money, Beynon.

327
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:15,782
I want to get north.

328
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:19,407
She told me no one would get killed.

329
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:31,171
I'm in a hurry, Beynon.

330
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:33,879
You still don't get the picture, do you?

331
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:37,892
And I've always heard
what a smart-ass operator you was.

332
00:48:38,228 --> 00:48:39,473
No applause.

333
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:44,308
Let's examine the situation.

334
00:48:45,986 --> 00:48:48,857
One. An extremely attractive woman.

335
00:48:56,038 --> 00:48:58,069
And there's the woman's husband.

336
00:48:58,173 --> 00:49:00,739
And there's a man with political influence.

337
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:04,373
A man who can easily get a parole
for a convict.

338
00:49:05,548 --> 00:49:06,924
Why should he?

339
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,870
A simple reason, McCoy.

340
00:49:08,975 --> 00:49:10,593
Let's get down to it.

341
00:49:10,804 --> 00:49:13,091
Radio's rapping about $750,000.

342
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:15,887
There's a half a million, here.

343
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:20,093
A little more was taken out before.

344
00:49:20,854 --> 00:49:23,689
You see, my brother's
the director of that bank.

345
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:26,479
We had a few problems we had to iron out.

346
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,487
Okay. We covered you...

347
00:49:33,158 --> 00:49:34,158
Yeah.

348
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:36,029
You surely did, Doc.

349
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:46,122
My old lady must've made you
a lot of promises.

350
00:49:47,172 --> 00:49:48,215
Close.

351
00:49:48,757 --> 00:49:50,168
I wouldn't feel...

352
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:05,392
Stupid!

353
00:52:06,518 --> 00:52:08,427
Why didn't you tell me, huh?

354
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:10,219
Why didn't you tell me?

355
00:52:10,323 --> 00:52:12,602
There wasn't any way to explain it.

356
00:52:18,822 --> 00:52:20,779
You sent me to him, you know.

357
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:32,456
What the hell do you want anyway?

358
00:52:53,982 --> 00:52:55,227
Goddamn you!

359
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,208
Still no answer.

360
00:53:19,715 --> 00:53:21,126
Something's wrong.

361
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:25,341
Come on! Come on!

362
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:32,310
What's the damage?

363
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:37,091
Your collarbone's broken
but it's not shattered.

364
00:53:37,195 --> 00:53:38,982
There's no infection, yet.

365
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:42,023
Those bandages ought
to be changed twice a day.

366
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,228
It's okay.

367
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:46,657
I got a nurse in mind.

368
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,451
The three of us are gonna
do some traveling.

369
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:57,206
We're gonna take your car to El Paso.

370
00:53:58,337 --> 00:54:00,377
We... we can't leave here.

371
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,671
That's not possible.
I mean, we have all of this.

372
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,680
Is that possible, Mrs. Clinton?

373
00:54:13,936 --> 00:54:15,810
Just tell us what you want.

374
00:54:22,653 --> 00:54:24,435
What kind of a car do you drive?

375
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:26,273
A Ford. We have a Ford.

376
00:54:31,495 --> 00:54:32,740
That's good.

377
00:54:35,082 --> 00:54:36,826
That's very good, Harold.

378
00:54:37,626 --> 00:54:39,868
You run on out and gas up the Ford.

379
00:54:41,172 --> 00:54:44,173
If anybody but you comes back, Harold...

380
00:54:45,676 --> 00:54:47,716
...she gets her clock stopped.

381
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,680
You do what he says, Harold.

382
00:54:55,685 --> 00:54:57,096
Just do as I say.

383
00:55:14,996 --> 00:55:17,238
You. Get a cloth.

384
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:19,869
You're gonna wash me.

385
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:28,455
They still may be on the way to Laredo.

386
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,386
What about El Paso?
He's a friend of Laughlin.

387
00:55:32,013 --> 00:55:33,289
Well, we have to cover them both.

388
00:55:33,394 --> 00:55:35,459
We've got to get somebody down there.
Either Rudy or...

389
00:55:35,564 --> 00:55:37,931
...McCoy's got a half a million bucks.

390
00:55:38,186 --> 00:55:40,392
- Put out the word.
- What about Jack?

391
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:44,718
Just dump him down a dry well,
if you can find one.

392
00:55:44,822 --> 00:55:46,941
No, he ought to be buried proper.

393
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,229
You just do what I tell you.

394
00:55:53,158 --> 00:55:54,569
Thank you, ma'am.

395
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:00,164
Wendy, sit down.

396
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:04,165
Two day-coach tickets to El Paso.

397
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:13,009
Leaves in 45 minutes. Gate three.
Thank you, ma'am.

398
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:16,573
Kind of tricky, isn't it?

399
00:57:22,748 --> 00:57:24,539
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

400
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:40,551
Come over here.

401
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,778
You don't always have to
take your gun out.

402
00:58:02,578 --> 00:58:04,405
I'll do anything you want.

403
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:06,791
Really.

404
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:08,501
I will.

405
00:58:14,048 --> 00:58:15,957
Get rid of that nail polish.

406
00:58:17,552 --> 00:58:18,552
Okay.

407
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,172
I don't like it.

408
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,650
And get rid of that, too.

409
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:36,685
What is that?

410
00:59:00,428 --> 00:59:02,966
Don't get any blood on me. I hate blood.

411
00:59:12,398 --> 00:59:15,352
Say, you wouldn't happen to be
a Mormon, would you?

412
00:59:16,903 --> 00:59:18,390
No, I'm afraid not.

413
00:59:18,494 --> 00:59:19,597
I'd like another one.

414
00:59:19,701 --> 00:59:20,978
Me, neither.

415
00:59:21,532 --> 00:59:24,202
I'm from Orem. That's right near Salt Lake.

416
00:59:25,036 --> 00:59:29,365
There's about 12 people in the state who
aren't Mormons, and I'm one of them.

417
00:59:32,043 --> 00:59:34,449
I guess that makes you kind of special.

418
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,868
- Yeah, I guess it does.
- Thank you.

419
00:59:38,715 --> 00:59:39,913
Hey, baby.

420
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:45,041
You wouldn't be taking the train
to Salt Lake, would you?

421
00:59:45,146 --> 00:59:46,680
No, I'm afraid not!

422
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:48,380
That's just my luck.

423
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:50,296
Listen, I hope you have a really nice trip.

424
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,635
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.

425
00:59:56,233 --> 00:59:57,470
Where's the bag?

426
00:59:57,575 --> 00:59:59,441
It's in the locker. I've got the key.

427
01:00:38,274 --> 01:00:39,301
A man helped me open it.

428
01:00:39,405 --> 01:00:40,687
How long ago?

429
01:00:41,444 --> 01:00:42,986
Fifteen minutes ago.

430
01:00:48,117 --> 01:00:51,782
It's the oldest con game in the world.
He switched keys with you.

431
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:59,740
He'll figure you for more time.
He's probably still in the station.

432
01:00:59,844 --> 01:01:00,953
Find him.

433
01:01:28,115 --> 01:01:32,493
<i>Your attention please. The Lone Star Flyer</i>
<i>for ...and El Paso now boarding.</i>

434
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:40,202
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

435
01:01:40,378 --> 01:01:43,497
<i>The Lone Star Flyer for...</i>

01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:46,962
<i>...El Paso now boarding on track site.</i>

437
01:01:57,603 --> 01:01:59,726
- There you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.

438
01:02:16,706 --> 01:02:19,872
You have coach number six.
You've got coach number four.

439
01:02:20,042 --> 01:02:21,834
You have coach number two.

440
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:24,033
- My aunt forgot her bag.
- Yes, sir.

441
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:25,504
Coach number six.

442
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,048
Coach number four. Coach number three.

443
01:02:32,303 --> 01:02:34,711
- I'm gonna see somebody off.
- All right.

444
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,855
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

445
01:02:53,959 --> 01:02:57,817
<i>Last call for the Lone Star Flyer</i>
<i>now leaving at track site.</i>

446
01:02:57,996 --> 01:03:01,696
<i>Last call for the Lone Star Flyer</i>
<i>now leaving at track site.</i>

447
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:19,600
That's awfully heavy. To save my life,
I can't possibly lift it up there.

448
01:03:20,976 --> 01:03:22,091
Thank you.

449
01:03:22,478 --> 01:03:24,270
That's coach number one.

450
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:25,898
That's coach three.

451
01:03:42,749 --> 01:03:44,902
Y'all gonna miss the train, you know?

452
01:03:45,006 --> 01:03:47,199
Car number three, right over there.

453
01:03:47,303 --> 01:03:48,789
All aboard!

454
01:05:03,537 --> 01:05:06,242
It’ll be open five minutes out of the station.

455
01:06:45,304 --> 01:06:46,964
Tickets, please.

456
01:07:37,147 --> 01:07:38,522
Tickets, please.

457
01:07:38,774 --> 01:07:41,728
When you work on a lock,
don't leave any scratches.

458
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:06,674
Tickets please.

459
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:08,711
Two. End of the line.

460
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:13,800
I'll get you.

461
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:29,984
Stick 'em up!

462
01:08:32,619 --> 01:08:35,157
I said, "Stick 'em up or I'll shoot you."

463
01:08:44,005 --> 01:08:45,160
Now, listen...

464
01:08:45,264 --> 01:08:48,748
...I know you're a good kid.
Now, get back there with your mother.

465
01:08:48,852 --> 01:08:51,963
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna break your little arm.

466
01:08:53,056 --> 01:08:54,056
Okay?

467
01:09:00,813 --> 01:09:02,428
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

468
01:09:02,532 --> 01:09:05,690
<i>The 7:10 Special arriving</i>
<i>from Dallas and Fort Worth...</i>

469
01:09:05,818 --> 01:09:07,894
<i>...has been 20 minutes delayed.</i>

470
01:09:08,529 --> 01:09:11,234
Next stop: Alpine, Texas.

471
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:14,236
Next stop: Alpine, Texas.

472
01:09:34,472 --> 01:09:36,381
Talk it up a little, Harold.

473
01:09:37,558 --> 01:09:39,266
It'd be good for you.

474
01:09:40,853 --> 01:09:42,181
Loosen you up.

475
01:09:44,315 --> 01:09:46,473
Something ought to loosen him up.

476
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,477
Something ought to loosen him up.

477
01:09:51,072 --> 01:09:53,444
What are we going to El Paso for, Rudy?

478
01:09:55,451 --> 01:09:57,241
I'm looking for a suitcase.

479
01:09:57,369 --> 01:09:59,028
At the Laughlin Hotel.

480
01:10:04,209 --> 01:10:05,402
You Laughlin?

481
01:10:05,506 --> 01:10:07,293
Yes, sir, all the time.

482
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:10,495
This is my wife and that there's Junior.

483
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,004
Congratulations.

484
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:16,541
- I need a room.
- You don't have to look any farther.

485
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:19,010
One thing we got here is lots of rooms.

486
01:10:19,182 --> 01:10:20,641
Sign right there.

487
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:23,261
That'll be $5 in advance.

488
01:10:23,937 --> 01:10:25,016
Junior...

489
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:28,062
...show this gentleman to his room.

490
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:32,019
Checking-out time is 1:00 p.m.

491
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,314
No girls allowed in the rooms.

492
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:35,688
House rules.

493
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:03,600
Call the conductor.

494
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,388
Mama, Mama, Mama...

495
01:11:06,604 --> 01:11:08,136
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

496
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,481

497
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:15,068
<i>Shuttle train from Alpine</i>

498
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,345
You're all right.

499
01:11:46,853 --> 01:11:48,513
How did you get it back?

500
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:51,300
If you're trying to get me back
in Huntsville...

501
01:11:51,404 --> 01:11:53,884
...you're going about it in the right way.

502
01:11:53,988 --> 01:11:57,141
I wouldn't worry about it,
'cause I can always get you out.

503
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:00,517
I mean, I can screw every prison official
in Texas, if I want to.

504
01:12:00,621 --> 01:12:02,186
Texas is a big state.

505
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,609
- I can handle it.
- Yeah, I bet you can.

506
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,582
You'd do the same for me, Doc,
wouldn't you?

507
01:12:14,922 --> 01:12:17,294
I mean, if I got caught, wouldn't you?

508
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:33,719
You don't like the way things are,
I don't like the way things are.

509
01:12:33,823 --> 01:12:35,137
What are we gonna do about it?

510
01:12:35,241 --> 01:12:36,977
Maybe we should split up.

511
01:12:38,404 --> 01:12:40,396
I'll cut up the money with you.

512
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:45,031
- Do you mean that?
- Yeah, I mean it.

513
01:12:50,415 --> 01:12:52,075
Well, I don't want to.

514
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,016
I have to stop.

515
01:13:14,481 --> 01:13:15,560
Not now.

516
01:13:15,733 --> 01:13:18,270
We have to beat that suitcase to El Paso.

517
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:38,370
We'll grab a hotel room, tonight.

518
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,422
First thing tomorrow...

519
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:43,588
...just go out and buy us another car.

520
01:13:43,801 --> 01:13:46,287
Then you go out,
buy yourself some other clothes.

521
01:13:46,391 --> 01:13:48,095
And pick up some for me.

522
01:13:48,681 --> 01:13:50,840
Tonight, I want you to go out...

523
01:13:51,684 --> 01:13:53,549
You go out and get some food.
Paper bag it.

524
01:13:53,653 --> 01:13:55,426
We'll eat it in the hotel room.

525
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,810
What happens when they find the body?

526
01:13:58,733 --> 01:14:00,764
All they've got is a description.

527
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:03,935
Cops need a connection to channel it,
and they haven't got it.

528
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:05,645
It ain't gonna do them any good.

529
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:07,726
You've got it all figured out, don't you?

530
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:08,831
No.

531
01:14:10,745 --> 01:14:12,527
There's a few of things I'm working on.

532
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:13,784
Like what?

533
01:14:13,915 --> 01:14:15,409
Where'd you get it?

534
01:14:19,295 --> 01:14:20,706
It was a gift.

535
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:26,594
- Chico, get Lt. Judson down here.
- Yes, sir.

536
01:14:32,225 --> 01:14:33,878
Call a medical officer, too.

537
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:36,008
Come on, boys,
let's look at some photographs.

538
01:14:36,112 --> 01:14:37,183
Yes, sir.

539
01:14:42,025 --> 01:14:44,267
If Rudy was by himself, we're okay.

540
01:14:44,695 --> 01:14:46,486
If he worked for Beynon...

541
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:52,773
...Beynon's people will be waiting for us
at Laughlin's in El Paso.

542
01:14:52,878 --> 01:14:54,412
You're full of "ifs."

543
01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:57,200
So are you, baby.

544
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:05,623
I think you liked it with him.

545
01:15:07,801 --> 01:15:09,379
I think he got to you.

546
01:15:11,513 --> 01:15:12,556
Maybe.

547
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,468
At least I got to him.

548
01:15:17,269 --> 01:15:18,506
What about this one, boys?

549
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:20,801
- Yeah. Yeah, that's him!
- Yeah, that's the guy!

550
01:15:20,906 --> 01:15:22,719
- That's the one!
- That's him, all right.

551
01:15:22,823 --> 01:15:24,477
That's the man, Officer.

552
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:27,311
That's the one you shot, Raymond.

553
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,652
What about him?

554
01:15:33,953 --> 01:15:37,701
Listen, I'm a friend of the court, right?
That's why I'm here.

555
01:15:38,707 --> 01:15:40,860
You're here because you're under arrest.

556
01:15:40,964 --> 01:15:42,122
Lock him up.

557
01:15:43,295 --> 01:15:46,741
<i>The man has been positively identified</i>
<i>as Carter "Doc" McCoy...</i>

558
01:15:46,845 --> 01:15:49,537
<i>...only recently paroled</i>
<i>from Huntsville Penitentiary.</i>

559
01:15:49,642 --> 01:15:53,291
<i>He is believed to be traveling</i>
<i>with his wife, Carol Ainsley McCoy.</i>

560
01:15:53,395 --> 01:15:55,511
<i>Stay tuned for further details.</i>

561
01:15:56,308 --> 01:15:58,217
How you doing there, Harold?

562
01:16:06,026 --> 01:16:08,149
Do I have to take it off again?

563
01:16:08,487 --> 01:16:09,862
The radio, off.

564
01:16:36,931 --> 01:16:38,176
Come on, work!

565
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:43,972
Give me the news!

566
01:16:48,693 --> 01:16:50,650
Can't trust a thing nowadays.

567
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:55,734
Tell you something. One of these days,
you're gonna have to trust somebody.

568
01:16:56,784 --> 01:16:57,899
I trust.

569
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:07,542
You want to see what I trust?

570
01:17:09,714 --> 01:17:11,089
"In God I trust."

571
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:14,128
It's the words on the back of every bill.

572
01:17:15,678 --> 01:17:19,261
Just keep that up, Doc,
and it won't matter how far we get away.

573
01:17:20,224 --> 01:17:22,793
'Cause there won't be
anything left between us.

574
01:17:22,898 --> 01:17:24,436
You understand that?

575
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,100
Nothing.

576
01:17:42,495 --> 01:17:43,658
Pull over.

577
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:05,889
Yes, sir.

578
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:08,888
Yeah. I'd like to have a radio.

579
01:18:09,065 --> 01:18:10,135
One of those portables.

580
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:13,020
All right, sir. We got them
from $15 to $55.

581
01:18:13,152 --> 01:18:14,223
Take your pick.

582
01:18:14,327 --> 01:18:16,312
- A $15 job.
- All right, sir.

583
01:18:16,489 --> 01:18:18,687
<i>...Beacon City bank robbery last week...</i>

584
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:23,409
<i>...where they, along with two accomplices,</i>
<i>made off with more than three quarters...</i>

585
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,580
That'll be, $15.95 and 60 cents tax, sir.

586
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:33,914
I'll get your change.

587
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:41,838
Want your change, sir?

588
01:18:49,687 --> 01:18:52,225
Now we got trouble. Let's clear the car.

589
01:19:00,865 --> 01:19:02,142
Yes, sir, can I help you?

590
01:19:02,246 --> 01:19:04,614
I want a shotgun, 12-gauge pump.

591
01:19:05,745 --> 01:19:08,525
- How about this one right here?
- Yeah, that's fine. Wrap it up.

592
01:19:08,629 --> 01:19:10,987
Sir, you'll have to sign this form here.

593
01:19:11,091 --> 01:19:14,085
And let me have a pack
of those double-ought bucks.

594
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:17,250
What are you going to do,
knock a wall down?

595
01:19:22,219 --> 01:19:25,754
Sir, you'll have to...
have to fill out these forms here, sir.

596
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:33,507
You know what this is, don't you, mister?

597
01:19:33,612 --> 01:19:34,612
Yeah.

598
01:19:35,024 --> 01:19:37,431
All right, now wrap that up. Let's go.

599
01:19:41,238 --> 01:19:43,314
I don't know where they went to.

600
01:19:53,709 --> 01:19:56,081
Operator, get me the police.

601
01:19:57,671 --> 01:20:00,672
There's this car here,
and the man's in there, too.

602
01:20:01,258 --> 01:20:02,534
You might...

603
01:20:02,639 --> 01:20:05,304
...try down here or up there. I don't know.

604
01:20:07,097 --> 01:20:09,506
Call Willie up. That lady right there.

605
01:20:23,781 --> 01:20:25,102
Hold it! Right there!

606
01:20:25,206 --> 01:20:27,357
Get those guns out on the street.

607
01:20:27,951 --> 01:20:29,327
Kick them over.

608
01:20:30,954 --> 01:20:32,912
Now, lay down in that gutter!

609
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:35,244
In the gutter!

610
01:20:39,088 --> 01:20:40,796
You, keep your face down!

611
01:21:14,498 --> 01:21:16,703
What the hell's the matter with you?

612
01:21:58,666 --> 01:21:59,864
Hang a "U."

613
01:22:06,716 --> 01:22:08,044
Punch it, baby.

614
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:15,969
Go ahead.

615
01:22:31,907 --> 01:22:33,236
In there.

616
01:23:08,277 --> 01:23:10,981
- How much to Dallas?
- Sixteen dollars.

617
01:23:56,616 --> 01:23:57,815
Hey, dummy!

618
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:03,490
How you doing, Slim?

619
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:05,202
Where you going?

620
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:06,405
Mexico.

621
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:08,699
How much did you pay for that thing?

622
01:24:08,804 --> 01:24:09,846
$2,800.

623
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:13,214
Come on, let's go.

624
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:36,148
Here, Harold.

625
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:37,989
Here.

626
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,360
Kitty.

627
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,531
Have a rib bone.

628
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:53,540
Have another rib.

629
01:24:57,302 --> 01:24:58,631
Christ, Rudy...

630
01:24:59,096 --> 01:25:00,582
...you ruined my skirt.

631
01:25:00,687 --> 01:25:03,597
Goddamn it, what'd you do that for?
Jesus!

632
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:08,603
Know why I did that?

633
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:13,690
It makes me feel good.

634
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:18,531
Stop it.

635
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,153
Rudy! Goddamn it!

636
01:25:25,413 --> 01:25:26,567
Have one yourself.

637
01:25:26,671 --> 01:25:27,862
You have one.

638
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:32,742
- Have a bone, Harold.
- Have a French fry.

639
01:25:33,254 --> 01:25:34,914
Have a rib, Harold.

640
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:38,753
Poor Harold.

641
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,101
Those are good ribs.

642
01:25:54,942 --> 01:25:56,512
- Wait a minute.
- Have some French fries.

643
01:25:56,617 --> 01:25:57,939
Wait a minute!

644
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:02,278
I don't like this game, anymore.

645
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:03,949
Okay.

646
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,487
You hear me?

647
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,627
You! You!

648
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:08,912
Okay.

649
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:32,470
<i>Authorities are reportedly on the lookout</i>
<i>for Doc McCoy and his wife, Carol.</i>

650
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:36,810
<i>The couple is reported traveling</i>
<i>in a late-model, gray Mercury sedan.</i>

651
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:40,224
<i>The pair is wanted for the recent</i>
<i>bank robbery in Beacon City, Texas...</i>

652
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:43,072
<i>...which netted the thieves $750,000.</i>

653
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,601
<i>In the course of the robbery,</i>
<i>two men were killed.</i>

654
01:26:45,705 --> 01:26:47,823
<i>The holdup money is still missing.</i>

655
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,407
Good evening.

656
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,494
Two hamburgers.

657
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:57,241
A milkshake and two coffees.

658
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:59,542
- What kind of milkshake?
- Chocolate.

659
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:01,909
- How about some fries?
- Why not?

660
01:27:02,013 --> 01:27:03,013
Okay.

661
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,290
Roll it up part way, please.

662
01:28:27,426 --> 01:28:28,426
Bang.

663
01:28:35,434 --> 01:28:36,434
Shit!

664
01:28:46,528 --> 01:28:47,772
She made us.

665
01:28:58,623 --> 01:29:00,662
There's that goddamn gray Merc.

666
01:30:02,186 --> 01:30:03,341
Punch it!

667
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:04,683
Punch it, baby!

668
01:33:22,885 --> 01:33:25,210
Help me shove these back.

669
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,541
It's been ten minutes.
Come on out of there.

670
01:36:34,365 --> 01:36:35,480
You okay?

671
01:36:37,326 --> 01:36:39,153
I guess so. I don't know.

672
01:36:41,748 --> 01:36:43,657
Well, it looks kind of deep.

673
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,003
No scar.

674
01:36:55,387 --> 01:36:58,424
Don't scratch.
It's liable to give you an infection.

675
01:37:01,143 --> 01:37:02,508
What did I tell you?

676
01:37:02,612 --> 01:37:04,014
It's not a game.

677
01:37:04,396 --> 01:37:05,807
It's all a game.

678
01:37:33,633 --> 01:37:35,913
- There's something I want...
- I don't want to hear it.

679
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:38,715
Listen! It's hard enough for me as it is!

680
01:37:41,766 --> 01:37:43,723
The things you said before...

681
01:37:44,352 --> 01:37:45,811
You might be right.

682
01:37:48,189 --> 01:37:51,356
Ain't gonna mean anything
if we don't make it together.

683
01:37:51,651 --> 01:37:53,608
I don't think we can make it.

684
01:37:53,945 --> 01:37:57,230
I think if we ever get out of this dump,
I'll just split.

685
01:38:00,743 --> 01:38:02,358
We've made it together so far.

686
01:38:02,463 --> 01:38:05,787
We've come a lot of miles
but we're not close to anything.

687
01:38:06,249 --> 01:38:08,740
I always thought jails made people hard.

688
01:38:09,502 --> 01:38:13,364
Not you, boy. I mean, you're just not
tough enough to forget about Beynon.

689
01:38:13,467 --> 01:38:17,413
I chose you, not him, you know that?
Not that it makes any difference.

690
01:38:40,866 --> 01:38:42,693
We pick up or we leave it.

691
01:38:43,326 --> 01:38:45,996
We leave it here, there's no other way.

692
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:14,725
No more about him.

693
01:39:21,698 --> 01:39:23,240
Whatever happens...

694
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,785
...no more about him.

695
01:40:16,627 --> 01:40:19,248
$8 a day, in advance. House rules.

696
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:22,040
Checking-out time is 1:00 p.m.

697
01:40:25,428 --> 01:40:27,708
Oh, no. Would you please
carry my kitty for me?

698
01:40:27,812 --> 01:40:28,968
- Cat?
- Yeah.

699
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:30,416
What's its name?

700
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:31,709
Poor Little Harold.

701
01:40:31,813 --> 01:40:34,347
- That's a strange name for a pussy.
- Yeah.

702
01:40:38,315 --> 01:40:40,723
That's why it's kind of hard to figure.

703
01:40:41,527 --> 01:40:44,279
Don't hold for it. You gotta let 'em run.

704
01:40:44,697 --> 01:40:47,438
Dumb those goddamn horse trainers
try to rate them.

705
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:49,270
Just breaks their heart.

706
01:40:49,374 --> 01:40:51,483
All right to put the pussy on the bed?

707
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:52,587
Yeah.

708
01:40:54,165 --> 01:40:56,241
The Lord loves a cheerful giver.

709
01:40:58,669 --> 01:41:00,377
Okay, now, "house rule."

710
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:02,575
You got two choices.

711
01:41:02,679 --> 01:41:05,044
- You can live or you can die.
- Yes, sir.

712
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:08,632
What... what do I have to do?

713
01:41:09,846 --> 01:41:11,461
You have to do what I tell you to do.

714
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:12,635
Yes, sir.

715
01:41:13,808 --> 01:41:16,755
You do that and you not only get to live,
but you'll make a few dollars.

716
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:17,932
Yes, sir.

717
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:21,687
Now, I'm expecting Doc McCoy.

718
01:41:22,692 --> 01:41:24,649
- You know Doc McCoy?
- Yes, sir.

719
01:41:24,819 --> 01:41:27,599
Then you're gonna let me know
the minute he gets here.

720
01:41:27,703 --> 01:41:28,860
Yes, sir.

721
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:38,703
That's all.

722
01:42:08,446 --> 01:42:10,403
Rudy showed up with a broad.

723
01:42:14,369 --> 01:42:15,993
Laughlin's in El Paso.

724
01:42:16,621 --> 01:42:17,902
Rudy's there.

725
01:42:19,249 --> 01:42:20,743
Mexico... tonight.

726
01:42:21,626 --> 01:42:22,626
Two.

727
01:42:22,768 --> 01:42:24,745
Sure, Doc, I can do it for you.

728
01:42:25,839 --> 01:42:27,831
Just like old times, ain't it?

729
01:42:28,425 --> 01:42:29,425
Yeah.

730
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:32,087
It's a nervous way to live.

731
01:43:12,051 --> 01:43:13,331
Hello, Jimmy.

732
01:43:13,927 --> 01:43:15,635
Oh, good to see you, Doc.

733
01:43:18,432 --> 01:43:21,091
- How's your family?
- Growing fast all the time.

734
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:23,261
Well, I got it all here for you.

735
01:43:23,479 --> 01:43:25,139
Departure and arrival.

736
01:43:25,606 --> 01:43:27,148
All except the $500.

737
01:43:28,442 --> 01:43:30,233
- I get any calls?
- No, sir.

738
01:43:31,362 --> 01:43:33,847
My old lady will be here
in about five minutes.

739
01:43:33,952 --> 01:43:36,228
I want you to get some food
and take it to the room.

740
01:43:36,332 --> 01:43:37,784
Just sandwiches?

741
01:43:37,993 --> 01:43:39,653
Yeah, that's all right.

742
01:43:40,662 --> 01:43:42,565
When she comes,
she'll have some luggage.

743
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:44,485
Have that boy take it up to the room.

744
01:43:44,589 --> 01:43:46,404
Well, he took the day off.

745
01:43:46,508 --> 01:43:47,573
Do it yourself.

746
01:43:47,677 --> 01:43:50,042
I can't, Doc. I can't leave the desk.

747
01:43:50,464 --> 01:43:52,836
You'll be in 318, Doc, till 11:00 p.m.

748
01:43:54,884 --> 01:43:57,664
Nobody else is on the floor.
You're by yourself.

749
01:43:57,768 --> 01:43:58,925
All right.

750
01:44:12,194 --> 01:44:13,474
Answer it.

751
01:44:18,534 --> 01:44:19,576
Hello?

752
01:44:22,538 --> 01:44:24,162
Doc McCoy just got in.

753
01:44:24,415 --> 01:44:25,415
318.

754
01:44:26,166 --> 01:44:27,246
Yes, sir.

755
01:44:33,549 --> 01:44:35,209
Get up and get dressed.

756
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:48,730
318.

757
01:45:28,978 --> 01:45:30,259
Are you ready?

758
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:33,104
What are you doing?

759
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:39,277
- I'm coming in with you.
- No.

760
01:45:44,077 --> 01:45:45,654
Come on, honey.

761
01:45:51,249 --> 01:45:52,578
Come on, baby.

762
01:46:29,831 --> 01:46:31,408
What's the big hurry?

763
01:46:40,967 --> 01:46:42,165
I'm hurrying!

764
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,358
Five fours.

765
01:47:21,089 --> 01:47:22,282
What's the matter?

766
01:47:22,386 --> 01:47:23,620
He's a juicer.

767
01:47:23,724 --> 01:47:26,497
His wife and kid are always with him
to keep him off the horses...

768
01:47:26,601 --> 01:47:28,377
...and to keep him off the sauce.

769
01:47:28,481 --> 01:47:29,524
So what?

770
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:32,381
So they're not here. He sent them away.

771
01:47:32,809 --> 01:47:35,347
Get your ass in gear, baby, and let's go.

772
01:47:38,899 --> 01:47:40,392
- Move it.
- Okay.

773
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:56,952
Who is it?

774
01:47:57,416 --> 01:48:00,417
It's your food, ma'am.
I brought up the sandwiches.

775
01:48:03,297 --> 01:48:04,340
Stall.

776
01:48:05,841 --> 01:48:09,293
Just leave them outside the door.
I'm not dressed right now.

777
01:48:11,597 --> 01:48:12,790
I can't do that, ma'am.

778
01:48:12,894 --> 01:48:17,433
You must pay now 'cause I have to pay
the boy that went out to get the food.

779
01:48:22,066 --> 01:48:23,109
Ma'am.

780
01:48:25,778 --> 01:48:29,685
Listen, you're just gonna have to wait
a minute. My husband's in the shower.

781
01:48:29,789 --> 01:48:30,789
Okay.

782
01:48:39,624 --> 01:48:42,245
He'll be right out. Just wait a second.

783
01:49:46,649 --> 01:49:48,441
Come on, it's me, open up.

784
01:50:11,549 --> 01:50:12,914
I don't remember.

785
01:50:13,019 --> 01:50:14,457
Listen, you old bastard...

786
01:50:14,562 --> 01:50:16,251
...tell me what I want to hear,
or I'm gonna rip...

787
01:50:16,355 --> 01:50:18,416
...these fingers clear up to your elbows.

788
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,139
Are you gonna tell me?

789
01:50:20,433 --> 01:50:22,170
- McCoy's in...
- What room is he in?

790
01:50:22,275 --> 01:50:23,884
- He's in 318.
- What? 318.

791
01:50:23,988 --> 01:50:26,648
You better not be lying to me, you old fool.

792
01:51:19,034 --> 01:51:21,359
Down the hall, Max. Around the rear.

793
01:51:38,969 --> 01:51:40,132
Oh, my God.

794
01:51:47,144 --> 01:51:48,144
Rudy!

795
01:51:49,688 --> 01:51:50,688
Rudy!

796
01:51:57,654 --> 01:51:58,654
Rudy!

797
01:52:02,076 --> 01:52:03,190
Bang, bang.

798
01:52:10,334 --> 01:52:11,334
Rudy!

799
01:52:14,338 --> 01:52:16,081
Where's Rudy?

800
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,330
Have you seen Rudy?

801
01:52:20,435 --> 01:52:22,917
No, I haven't seen Rudy, you dumb broad.

802
01:52:53,084 --> 01:52:55,123
Operator. Get me the police!

803
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:30,714
Don't do it! Don't!

804
01:54:31,682 --> 01:54:34,089
Just run away. Just... now! Run away!

805
01:54:36,687 --> 01:54:38,679
- Drive!
- Sure thing, mister.

806
01:54:39,523 --> 01:54:41,554
- Get in there.
- Whatever you say.

807
01:54:41,658 --> 01:54:42,721
Want me to go, too?

808
01:54:42,825 --> 01:54:44,526
- Hey, are you hurt?
- No.

809
01:54:49,241 --> 01:54:50,616
Straight ahead.

810
01:54:53,495 --> 01:54:55,286
Hang in there, now, folks.

811
01:55:07,843 --> 01:55:09,246
Hey, how was that one?

812
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:11,337
Oh, that was fine. Just fine.

813
01:55:12,555 --> 01:55:14,132
Where are we heading?

814
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:16,098
We're going to Mexico.

815
01:55:24,275 --> 01:55:25,929
Can you find a nice, quiet place?

816
01:55:26,033 --> 01:55:27,402
Get us through?

817
01:55:27,862 --> 01:55:29,404
Why in the hell not?

818
01:55:29,697 --> 01:55:31,606
And don't hit any more cars.

819
01:55:35,286 --> 01:55:37,991
I don't reckon you're gonna shoot me,
are you?

820
01:55:40,166 --> 01:55:41,614
I kind of doubt it.

821
01:55:41,718 --> 01:55:42,985
Well, that's fine.

822
01:55:43,089 --> 01:55:45,374
Now don't you worry, I'll cooperate.

823
01:55:45,755 --> 01:55:48,590
Shoot, I've been in trouble
with the law myself.

824
01:55:51,886 --> 01:55:54,009
Can I ask you a personal question?

825
01:55:56,098 --> 01:55:57,098
Sure.

826
01:55:58,684 --> 01:56:00,226
Are you kids married?

827
01:56:01,312 --> 01:56:02,312
Yeah.

828
01:56:02,772 --> 01:56:03,971
I'm glad.

829
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:06,265
Damn, you know...

830
01:56:06,369 --> 01:56:08,679
...that's the problem
in this goddamned world.

831
01:56:08,783 --> 01:56:10,438
There ain't no morals.

832
01:56:11,822 --> 01:56:15,322
Kids figure if they ain't living together,
they ain't living.

833
01:56:33,469 --> 01:56:34,963
<i>Buenas tardes.</i>

834
01:56:35,137 --> 01:56:37,379
Chihuahua City. Building materials.

835
01:56:45,856 --> 01:56:46,971
Crazy.

836
01:56:53,864 --> 01:56:56,267
You know, if I was you kids, what I'd do?

837
01:56:56,371 --> 01:56:58,731
I'd quit this running around the country.

838
01:56:58,835 --> 01:57:01,064
You know, get a little bit
of money together...

839
01:57:01,169 --> 01:57:04,615
...and I'd buy a place and settle down,
and raise a family.

840
01:57:05,458 --> 01:57:07,866
I've been married for 35 years.

841
01:57:08,378 --> 01:57:11,130
Same old gal. Man, she's a tough old hide.

842
01:57:11,756 --> 01:57:14,294
Yeah, everything I am, I owe to her.

843
01:57:25,979 --> 01:57:27,022
Say...

844
01:57:28,148 --> 01:57:30,187
Pull over, over here, would you?

845
01:57:30,692 --> 01:57:32,352
Okay, whatever you say.

846
01:57:38,992 --> 01:57:40,071
Now what?

847
01:57:40,869 --> 01:57:42,529
Let's get out a spell.

848
01:58:14,610 --> 01:58:16,982
How much money did you make last year?

849
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:28,574
I reckon about $5,000.

850
01:58:31,419 --> 01:58:34,373
Suppose I give you $10,000
for that truck of yours?

851
01:58:36,049 --> 01:58:37,329
You serious?

852
01:58:37,467 --> 01:58:38,467
I am.

853
01:58:40,887 --> 01:58:42,963
And I keep my mouth shut...

854
01:58:43,473 --> 01:58:46,178
...and I don't say nothing about the truck...

855
01:58:46,559 --> 01:58:49,477
...and I never seen neither one
of the two of you?

856
01:58:51,189 --> 01:58:52,731
That's what I want.

857
01:59:03,784 --> 01:59:05,243
How about $20,000?

858
01:59:06,495 --> 01:59:07,954
How about $30,000?

859
01:59:10,207 --> 01:59:12,365
Goddamn, ma'am, you got a deal.

860
01:59:14,962 --> 01:59:16,670
Pay the man, honey.

861
01:59:20,175 --> 01:59:21,202
Thank you, ma'am.

862
01:59:21,307 --> 01:59:23,540
Now, you'll have to walk
on back to the border.

863
01:59:23,644 --> 01:59:26,306
Oh, that's all right. Don't worry about me.

864
01:59:32,688 --> 01:59:35,135
I hope you find what you're looking for.

865
01:59:35,239 --> 01:59:37,059
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

866
01:59:37,317 --> 01:59:38,646
You too, ma'am.

867
01:59:43,449 --> 01:59:44,991
Take care, you hear?

868
01:59:47,327 --> 01:59:48,526
Goddamn it!

869
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:01,620
Come on.
