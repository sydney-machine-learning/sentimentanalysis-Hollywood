1
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:42,464
Come on, easy, girl.
Easy, girl. Easy.

2
00:01:51,304 --> 00:01:53,165
This is a stubborn one, huh?

3
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,039
There we go.
Who’s a clever girl?

4
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:20,989
War Horse

5
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,173
Good boy.

6
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,969
Here. Come on, boy. Here.

7
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,565
Come on.
Easy does it. Easy does it.

8
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,920
Come on, steady, boy.
That's it. Nice and done.

9
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:04,974
Hey, hey.

10
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,076
Mornin’, pop.

11
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,050
Put your mark here.

12
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,628
Good luck.

13
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,641
Get the colt...

14
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,511
Whoa! Whoa!

15
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,059
Easy...

16
00:05:57,906 --> 00:05:59,453
Now that’s a beauty.

17
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:03,885
Forget it, Ted. He’s half thoroughbred
and not got a day’s work in him.

18
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,301
Now, there...

19
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:09,876
There’s your ticket.

20
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:18,957
But look at him, Si.

21
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:20,836
Look at that creature.

22
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,374
Don’t be daft.

23
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:26,048
You need something
solid to plow a field.

24
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:30,326
Yeah, but he’s something else, that one.

25
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:34,457
Alright gentlemen,
settle down, settle down...

26
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:39,416
Horses on my right, men with money
in their pockets on my left.

27
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:41,902
It’s the perfect combination.

28
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:43,305
Is Fred Goddard here?

29
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,419
Yes! I’s here.

30
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:48,462
Good - more money than sense.

31
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:50,843
Dave Hill?

32
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:52,815
I’m here. Yes!

33
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,404
Bugger off, you tight bastard.

34
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:59,052
You've been coming here for 20 years,
never bought so much as a pork scratching.

35
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,793
Come on.

36
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,709
Okay, first up today,
a gorgeous young horse...

37
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,449
Prettiest thing I've seen since my
wife on our wedding day.

38
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,236
Let’s get going, shall we?
Who wants this wonderful creature.

39
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:30,770
One guinea.

40
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,098
One guinea,
one guinea, one guinea...

41
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,597
I thought you needed
a plow horse, Mr. Narracott.

42
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,227
- Any advance on one guinea?
- Two guineas.

43
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:42,367
- Two guineas!
- Three!

44
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,530
Ted Narracott...
It’s completely the wrong animal.

45
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:48,446
Si Easton, I’m not gonna let
that bastard see me off.

46
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,529
- Five guineas.
- Six!

47
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,957
- Oh, for the love of...!
- Seven.

48
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:59,149
Greedy sod thinks he can just
buy anybody. Eight.

49
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:01,754
Stop it, he’s your landlord.
You can’t be picking fights with him.

50
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:02,972
Ten guineas.

51
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:07,321
You haven’t got the money.
Let’s go home, let’s have a pint.

52
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:10,798
Eleven guineas, sir,
from as good a man as any in this town.

53
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:15,903
Do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas?

54
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:19,723
That’s top price for a workin’ animal.
Ted! Save it for the shire!

55
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,060
There are big days and there are
small days. Which will it be?

56
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:25,083
Do I hear any advance on eleven guineas?

57
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,545
Just let him go, dad, I don’t care
for him, he’s too jumpy.

58
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:33,002
- Shall we say twenty five?
- 25 guineas

59
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:34,954
Well, he’s got you there.
Nice try, Ted.

60
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:38,381
You were great, Mr N.
Gave him a run for his money.

61
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:42,003
- Going, going...
- Thirty. Thirty guineas!

62
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,065
Thirty guineas.

63
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:46,333
Thirty guineas.

64
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:54,498
Going... Going...
Gone to Mister Ted Narracott.

65
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,655
What have you done, Ted?
What have you done?

66
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:21,440
Quite a beast, there. But what you
gonna do with him on a working farm?

67
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,623
I hope you got the rent, Ted.
I’ll be around for it when it comes due.

68
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:30,115
You’re a fool, Ted.
And our Rosie’ll never forgive you.

69
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:02,250
What have you done?

70
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:05,416
- That’s Mooney’s colt!
- You were supposed to buy a plow horse.

71
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:08,333
- You bought him?
- What’d you pay for him?

72
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,435
How much, Ted Narracott?

73
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,779
I won’t tell you a lie,
though I would love to.

74
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,661
Thirty guineas.

75
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,955
Thirty guineas!

76
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,378
He’s not worth ten!
Are you out of your mind?

77
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:24,816
What about the rent?

78
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:28,445
He’s a strong one, Rosie.
Look at the way he holds his head!

79
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:31,139
How the hell are we gonna
pull anything with that?

80
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,467
Ted, you have to take him back.
You have to take him back right now.

81
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:37,026
You have to get down on your knees
and beg for our money back.

82
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,361
No. No, please don’t take him back.

83
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,568
We can’t take him back till he’s broken in.

84
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,880
And how are you gonna
train a horse with that leg?

85
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:49,612
I’ll train him.

86
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:52,680
No, you stay out of this, Albie.
You don’t know nothing about horses.

87
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:54,400
Please, Mum.
Please let me. I can do it.

88
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:59,221
We have to keep him.
We’ve no choice.

89
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:04,263
Right. Well, you’ve got one month to
break him in or I’m taking him back myself.

90
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:10,511
How did you get to thirty,
what other fool bid you up that high?

91
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:12,903
It was Lyons.

92
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:19,158
We’re gonna lose everything.

93
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:23,070
After all we’ve been through,
we’re gonna lose it all.

94
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:30,677
Don’t worry, Mum, I’ll raise him
and I’ll raise him good.

95
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:33,049
Well, you better. Go on, get started.

96
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:38,259
See if a child can undo what your
fool of a father’s done to this family of ours.

97
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:43,131
Easy. Easy.

98
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:23,038
Right. Let’s make a start then.

99
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:35,196
It’s oats. Very tasty, that is.
It’s beef and gravy to us!

100
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:37,775
Come on...

101
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:09,043
I bet you’re missing your mother.

102
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:12,217
Look at you...

103
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:16,753
First time without your mum.
First time away from home.

104
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:20,657
But you’re not alone, are you?

105
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:26,506
In fact. Cos I’m ‘ere...

106
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:35,162
It’s alright. It’s alright.

107
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:40,158
I’m gonna call you Joey.

108
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:45,371
Understand?
Joey. That’s you.

109
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:52,052
And I’m Albert.
It’s alright, You’re mine now.

110
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:53,958
You’re mine.

111
00:14:35,953 --> 00:14:38,629
Good boy. Good boy.

112
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,357
Good boy, Come on.

113
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:56,126
Whoa. I want you to stay there, Joey.

114
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,462
Stay. That’s it.

115
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:03,020
Good boy.
That’s it, you’ve got it.

116
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:07,524
Hey, look at him, Albie.
He’s playing Grandma’s Footsteps.

117
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,986
Right, come on, Joey.
Back you go. Come on.

118
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,098
Back you go.
You’re all right.

119
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:20,513
That’s it. Good boy.

120
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:24,867
Right. You’ve gotta
stay there, understand?

121
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:29,786
That’s it. Good boy.

122
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:34,352
You’ve got it. Good boy.

123
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:39,546
Good boy. Good.

124
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:41,869
Now call him. Whistle.

125
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:46,496
Come now, Joey.

126
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:48,672
Come on.

127
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,428
You can come now, Joey.

128
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,355
Don’t think he fancies your owls.

129
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,490
No, I read it in a story.

130
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,715
It’s how the Indians used to
summon their horses.

131
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:17,265
Now, Joey, when I whistle,
you’ve gotta come, understand?

132
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:23,137
My dad had a dog
who stayed when you called him.

133
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,749
He used to run up behind you
when you weren’t looking, and uh...

134
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:31,539
He’s not a dog.
He’s just puzzling it through.

135
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,961
Brilliant. Look at you.

136
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,850
Albie.

137
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,630
There’s only fifteen here.

138
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,400
The rest will come.

139
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,770
You know by rights I could take
this farm back today, don’t you?

140
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,730
And I’m a great
believer in my rights.

141
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,360
It will come.

142
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,616
If you drank less beer
and bought fewer horses...

143
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:06,202
...you might be able to look your
landlord in the eye, Narracott.

144
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,790
I said I’ll pay you.

145
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,080
We got to plant the bottom field.

146
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,076
Bottom field’s rock hard.
Only stones down there.

147
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:19,620
No, we’re going to plow it.
Just give me ‘til the autumn.

148
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,990
I’ll pay every penny I owe you.
With interest.

149
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,500
How you going to plow it?
Not with that fancy animal of yours?

150
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:30,231
He’ll do it.

151
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,989
You’ll not get that one in a harness,
let alone pulling a plow.

152
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,489
Even drunk on a Tuesday night, you know that.

153
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,930
And I can’t wait for the money,
there’s a war coming.

154
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,470
I promise you that field will be plowed.

155
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,017
We’ll plant it with turnips.

156
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,370
And the money will be yours
when harvest comes.

157
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,495
Please, sir. Please.

158
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,329
Very well, if that fancy plows that field...

159
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,121
I’ll give you till October
to set things straight.

160
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,340
What if he doesn’t?

161
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,575
I’ll take the horse on the day he fails.

162
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,954
And I’ll take your father’s farm
and give it to working men...

163
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:33,070
...who can hold their pints and hold
their heads high in decent company.

164
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,959
No, please. Sir, you can’t do that.

165
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,610
Now, now, now, lad.
What, are you bladdered as well?!

166
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,670
Ted Narracott, I got you down in my book!

167
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:32,110
You can’t harness him.

168
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,627
He’s got to be collared.

169
00:20:33,662 --> 00:20:36,086
No, you can’t.
Look, you’re scaring him, Dad.

170
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:38,511
You’re scaring him.
He... He can’t take a plow!

171
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:39,847
He’s got to plow!

172
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,760
He won’t be able to do it. He’s too young,
he’s not even been backed yet...

173
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:46,887
Ted!

174
00:20:51,045 --> 00:20:56,130
It’s alright, boy. It’s alright.
It’s alright. It’s alright.

175
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,000
I knew this would happen
soon as I laid eyes on him...

176
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,490
Ted. No.

177
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:04,774
Ted, no!

178
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,390
He’s worth nothing to me! If he won’t take
the collar, he’s not worth a damn thing!

179
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,270
- Dad?
- Move aside.

180
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:14,516
Dad. Stop.

181
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,898
You shoot that horse we have nothing.

182
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:21,286
No!

183
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,011
You were right what you said, Dad.

184
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,720
He’ll do it,

185
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,960
You told Lyons, He’ll plow that field.
And he will!

186
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:38,300
You’ll see. He’ll show you.

187
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,710
We’ll show you.

188
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,790
We’ll get it done.

189
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:52,312
Let go. Let go.

190
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,774
Go back to the house.

191
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,340
Here, here.
Some days are best forgotten.

192
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,380
Today ain’t one of them. Come on.

193
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,970
How are you today, Joey?

194
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,610
I don't know much about life, boy,

195
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,510
But I do know that there are
big days and there are small days.

196
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,231
And most days are small days,

197
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:53,738
and, well, they don't matter
much to anyone... but this...

198
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,810
Well, this is a big one.

199
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,950
This is our big day.

200
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,596
Well, it's cold out there.
So I'm going to take this off...

201
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,580
Well, if it's tough for you,
it should be tough for me, too...

202
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:16,210
Now, I’m gonna
teach you how to plow...

203
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
...and you’re gonna learn.
Is that understood?

204
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,235
And then we can be together,
which is how I believe things are meant to be.

205
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,464
Boy. Steady, boy.

206
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:34,704
Here we go.
Here we go.

207
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:36,261
Come on.

208
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,890
Easy, easy...

209
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,585
Look at me, Joey.
See?

210
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:51,595
See?

211
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,040
You’ve just gotta
put your nose through.

212
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,446
That’s it.

213
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:05,736
See? You’ve got it.
You’ve got it.

214
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:11,486
Good boy. There...

215
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,849
Too large, too rocky,
matted with grass roots.

216
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,476
Even a sturdy plow horse’d
never manage it alone.

217
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,960
Yet he will, I say.

218
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,250
You’d swear he’d sprout wings
and fly if Albert had told you so.

219
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,370
It’s a fine thing, loyal to your
mate. Even if he is a bit barmy.

220
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,949
A team of two might manage,
given a month and good weather.

221
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,980
Ted too squeamish to watch, is he?

222
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,890
‘Course he’s watching.

223
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,714
Well, you’ve raised him up
a true Narracott, Ted,

224
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,268
Picture of his father, he is:

225
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,562
Not a dollop of ordinary sense
but that thick stubbornness...

226
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,030
...that’ll lead him to insist on the impossible.

227
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,776
Wasn’t a farmer in Devon didn’t
admire you, myself among ‘em,

228
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:14,883
Leaving your brothers that
fine farm and setting yourself...

229
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:17,080
...at this stoney patch
of unpromising ground.

230
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,890
You’ve fettle enough for twenty men,

231
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,210
But with a gimpy leg and the drinking...

232
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,300
For the pain, isn’t it,
that you drink?

233
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:34,590
Yeah, none of us could have
anticipated an ending better than this.

234
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,150
Makes me question the wisdom of the charity
that urged me to rent you this place,

235
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,160
Not only looking at you, me old pal,

236
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,460
but that pretty little wife of yours,
thought you were a spark, she did.

237
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,150
And now your son’s sinking into the
selfsame bog that’s swallowing you.

238
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,420
See, Joey.
I got the collar, too!

239
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,760
Come on, boy. Walk on. That’s it.

240
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,647
Walk on!

241
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,360
Walk on, Joey.
Come on, boy, walk on.

242
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:23,199
You’d be better off startin’ at the
top of the hill and goin’ down!

243
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,082
Gravity’s the only friend you’re
gonna have today, young lad.

244
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:31,551
Walk on, Joey! Walk on!

245
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,610
Come on, Joey, walk on.
Walk on, boy.

246
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:38,561
Walk on. Come on, walk on.

247
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:43,782
It’ll take the whip to move him.

248
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:15,710
Bravo! You’ve reached the top of the hill!
Off you go again, boy!

249
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:17,800
You’ll make even better
time comin’ down!

250
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:27,150
Good boy. Good lad. Good lad.
Now walk on. Good boy.

251
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,470
Albie, we’re all with ya!

252
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,350
Look look look!
The plow hasn’t even cut yet!

253
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,450
Do you know,
I believe we can do it, Joey.

254
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,790
I knew when I first saw
you that you’d be the best of us.

255
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,130
That’s why he bought you.

256
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,260
He knows you’ve all the courage he never had.

257
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,253
I knew when I first saw you that
you’d be the one who’d save us.

258
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,090
Whoa. Whoa.

259
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,590
You’ve got no chance, lad.

260
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,590
He’ll not turn over half an acre.
Give it up now.

261
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,875
You’ve done well.
You’ve tried hard.

262
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,470
You’re more of a man than your father.

263
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,221
Come on now, Mr. Lyons,
that’s a bit rough, isn’t it?

264
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:31,840
Well, he’ll destroy that horse.

265
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,006
I’ll be over Thursday.

266
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,510
Give you a day to close it up.

267
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,470
Your wool.

268
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:56,325
I’m sorry, Rosie.

269
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:19,043
Now, boy!
You’ve got to do it, Joey.

270
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:22,023
You don’t know, so I’m gonna have to
do the knowing for you...

271
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:24,589
...when the rest of our lives depend on this!

272
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:26,870
So get set to pull, and pull straight!

273
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,840
And pull hard!

274
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:34,084
Now, boy! Go!

275
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,210
Walk on, Joey! Walk on!

276
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,913
That’s it!
Good boy, Joey! Good boy!

277
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:52,181
Walk on! Walk on!
Walk on! Walk on, Joey!

278
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:10,543
Go around it!

279
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:13,914
Whoa, Joey!
Whoa, Joey!

280
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:17,007
Joey! Joey, whoa whoa whoa!

281
00:32:17,008 --> 00:32:19,286
Joey, stop!
You’ll break the blade...

282
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,190
Will you look at you?

283
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,219
I’d not let a child of mine slip in
the mud alongside a plow blade.

284
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:04,508
He could lose a foot!

285
00:33:04,543 --> 00:33:06,453
You’ll likelier lose an eye, Mr. Lyons,

286
00:33:06,488 --> 00:33:10,115
If you carry on prating at me
how to manage my son!

287
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,743
Or my plow, or my horse,
or my field, or my farm!

288
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,164
Come on, Albie! Push on through!

289
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:59,689
Get it done, Albie! Get it done!

290
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,652
Oh, my pair of fools.
My mighty fools.

291
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,270
You’re as battered and bloodied as he is.

292
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,571
And where’s Dad?

293
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:03,377
Still in the bottom field.
Stumbling about, I suppose.

294
00:35:03,378 --> 00:35:05,397
It’s not the drink, Albert,
that makes him stumble -

295
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:06,779
He drinks, mum.

296
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,000
Well, so might you if you’d been
where he’s been, seen what he’s seen!

297
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,800
Well, he don’t talk to me about it.

298
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:13,273
He don’t talk about it because he can’t.

299
00:35:13,274 --> 00:35:15,910
There aren’t words
for some things.

300
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,440
Come here...

301
00:35:30,884 --> 00:35:32,438
The mice’ve been at it.

302
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:34,329
Sit down.

303
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Here. It’s his campaign pennant.

304
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:48,290
He were Sergeant,
Seventh Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry.

305
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:54,302
And that is the Queen’s South Africa Medal.

306
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:57,301
Every man who fought
in the Boer War got one of those.

307
00:35:57,637 --> 00:35:58,638
But this...

308
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,630
That’s the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

309
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:04,019
Not dad’s?

310
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,590
Well it ain’t mine, dear.

311
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,979
He got that after the fighting at Transvaal.

312
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:12,882
After he’d been hurt,
and he’d saved some other lads,

313
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:14,950
and well... I don’t know
what else, he won’t tell me either.

314
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,070
But the first day he got home
he just tossed them out.

315
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,389
First day he could walk,
he threw ‘em straight in the dustbin,

316
00:36:20,424 --> 00:36:22,980
and wouldn’t hear a word I said not to.

317
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,950
See, what you done today, you and
Joey,

318
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,905
you’re chuffed up now, and so
you should be, my splendid boy.

319
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,626
It’s good to be proud
when you done something good.

320
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,500
But what he done, in Africa,
whatever it was,

321
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,210
He takes no pride in it.

322
00:36:39,937 --> 00:36:42,430
Hard as it surely was,
and however much pain it’s cost him,

323
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,449
he refuses to be
proud of killing, I suppose.

324
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:49,313
I’d be proud.

325
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:52,535
If I’d gone off to war. If I’d gone
and saved my mates, and -

326
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,851
Well, whether or not you think
you’d do the same thing as him...

327
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:56,880
Think how brave he is
for refusing to be proud.

328
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:06,651
Oh, your dad makes mistakes. And he drinks
to forget the mistakes that he’s made. but...

329
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,215
But he never gave up,
and he does that for us.

330
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,649
And today, you showed the world
it’s all been worth it.

331
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,783
You keep looking after Joey and
he’ll always be looking after you.

332
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:29,279
Sergeant, Seventh Battalion,
Imperial Yeomanry.

333
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,320
You see this, Joey?

334
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,150
It’s been through an entire war.

335
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,511
I’m not stealing it.

336
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,323
I’ll give it
back to him, someday.

337
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:32,479
I’m the only boy
that drives in the village.

338
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:34,135
- No one else drives but me.
- Oh, yeah?

339
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,756
That’s right and this is my dad’s car.

340
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:37,782
You’re lucky that you’re in it.

341
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:40,353
I’m not normally allowed
to drive it ‘cause it’s so -

342
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,098
Is he a friend of yours?

343
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,230
Come on, boy,
let’s show her how to fly!

344
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,690
Well... you’re clearly
not gonna be a jumper.

345
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,980
We can try planting something else,

346
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,590
Or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob.

347
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:27,641
How else we gonna pay Mr. Lyons’ rent?

348
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,150
What we gonna do?

349
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:57,210
I used to believe that God gave each man
his fair portion of bad luck.

350
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:03,100
I don’t feel that any more.
I’ve had more than my share.

351
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,293
You’ll stop loving me, Rose.
And I won’t blame you when you do.

352
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,200
Well, I might hate you more,

353
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,952
but I’ll never love you less.

354
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:31,103
It’s war!

355
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:34,481
We are at War with Germany.

356
00:41:34,516 --> 00:41:39,240
You hear?
England is at war with Germany.

357
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:45,440
They’re going to
ring the bells at six o’clock,

358
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:51,311
and then never ring them again
until the war is over.

359
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:02,387
Look smart, Joey lad, it’s the Tavistock Fair!

360
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,800
What has he done with him?

361
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,448
First name, middle name, last.

362
00:42:37,104 --> 00:42:39,856
Last name first.
First name, middle name, last.

363
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:43,749
Take my word for it,
finest horse in the parish.

364
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,680
Goes like a racer,
strong, decent, very fine.

365
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,204
No curbs, no splints,

366
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,580
good feet and teeth.
He’s as sound as a bell, sir.

367
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,710
And how much are you charging, sir,

368
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,730
for this strong, decent,
and very fine animal?!

369
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,275
Forty.

370
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,962
I’ll give you twenty and not a penny more.

371
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,880
Twenty is no good to me, Captain.

372
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,960
Thirty five and he’s yours.

373
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,304
I don’t even know how he rides.

374
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,490
Oh, he rides... Splendidly.

375
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,830
You’ll be astonished.
I promise you that.

376
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,910
Finest horse in all of Devon.

377
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,110
Finest horse I ever seen.

378
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:30,999
Thank you.

379
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,081
You can’t!
You can’t, he’s mine!

380
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,580
- I trained him!
- Albert.

381
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,390
You can’t have him.
He’s my horse, sir.

382
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:50,470
I’m afraid it’s too late, lad.
I’ve just paid thirty guineas for him.

383
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,190
Please, I’ll get you money.

384
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,660
I will, I’ll get you money.
I’ll... I’ll work for it!

385
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,640
I’ll work for it.

386
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,250
He won’t obey anyone else.

387
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,960
He won’t be any good in the war, neither.

388
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,190
He shies at every sound!

389
00:44:13,248 --> 00:44:14,057
I’m sorry.

390
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:17,960
Well, if Joey’s going,
I’m going, too. I’m volunteering.

391
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:21,240
- I see. What’s your name, lad?
- Albert, sir.

392
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,340
- And how old are you, Albert?
- Nineteen, sir.

393
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:26,657
- Is that the truth?
- No sir. But,

394
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:30,000
but I look nineteen and I’m
bigger than most nineteen-yearolds, sir!

395
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,750
And I’m strong, sir! And
I... I’m not afraid of anything.

396
00:44:31,751 --> 00:44:33,146
I don’t doubt your qualifications, Albert,

397
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,850
but the law is very clear
about the proper age for soldiering,

398
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,360
and your father’s done
what he had to do. You know that.

399
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,990
Thirty guineas isn’t nearly enough to purchase
a horse as fine as your Joey, I know that.

400
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:49,602
But it’s all I’ve got.

401
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,470
Will you lease him to me, Albert,
to be my own mount?

402
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,310
I promise you, man to man, that I’ll
look after him as closely as you’ve done,

403
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,230
I’ll respect him and all the
care that you’ve taken with him.

404
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,600
And if I can, I’ll return him to your care.

405
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,095
Now say goodbye.

406
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:26,563
It’s all right, boy...

407
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,940
All right, turn it in, eh?
That’s enough. He’s a horse, not a dog.

408
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,583
Now, on your way.

409
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:33,134
Come on.

410
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:42,574
Do you want to lose the farm, Rose?

411
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,350
It’s the way you did it.

412
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,430
But we’re at war.

413
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,010
Aren’t we just.

414
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,002
Joey...

415
00:46:32,003 --> 00:46:33,892
Here now, I’ve told you,
sling your hook!

416
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,250
Let him be, Perkins.

417
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,520
This isn’t the end.
This isn’t the end, my brother...

418
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,182
I, Albert Narracott, solemnly
swear we will be together again.

419
00:46:44,183 --> 00:46:45,960
Wherever you are, I will find you.

420
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,980
And I will bring you home!

421
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,290
Whoa. Steady, steady.
Steady now, come on.

422
00:47:10,332 --> 00:47:12,984
Walk on!
Walk on now, come on!

423
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,710
Whoa whoa, Easy. Easy.

424
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:01,090
Easy.

425
00:48:09,966 --> 00:48:13,890
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
Stay steady.

426
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,732
Whoa whoa whoa, Joey! Stop
muckin’ about, you hear?

427
00:48:17,733 --> 00:48:19,530
You're in the army now, son.

428
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:24,090
Good boy, good boy. Steady.

429
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,195
Steady, steady...
Come on. Come here. Easy.

430
00:48:31,433 --> 00:48:32,383
Relax.

431
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:34,700
Easy easy, back up.

432
00:48:38,344 --> 00:48:41,650
Joey, meet Topthorn.
Topthorn, this is Joey.

433
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,038
Sort out who’s in charge
between the two of you, you hear?

434
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:47,653
If you want to fight,
you get it over with,

435
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:50,890
‘Cause once we’re over there, you’re
gonna need everything you’ve got for Fritz!

436
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,770
Gently, Perkins.

437
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,207
I don’t want to sour him.

438
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,230
There’ll be nothing
gentle about the war, sir.

439
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,996
And there’ll be nothing gentle
about this one either!

440
00:49:00,031 --> 00:49:02,576
I understand that, Sergeant,
But I want him fit and shining.

441
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,090
He’s my horse.

442
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:05,752
Sir.

443
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,160
Easy, boy.

444
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,930
Scares the living daylights out of me.

445
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:13,500
Who?

446
00:49:13,572 --> 00:49:16,323
Perkins.
Glad he’s on our side.

447
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:19,389
Not bad. Not bad at all.

448
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:23,398
Still not a patch on my Topthorn.

449
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:26,478
I wouldn’t be so sure.
I think he’s got potential.

450
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,510
He’s certainly got the bit
between his teeth.

451
00:49:30,346 --> 00:49:33,159
I actually think my Blenheim is
faster than the pair of them.

452
00:49:34,189 --> 00:49:35,064
Clear off!

453
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,610
All right, gentlemen, listen here.

454
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,327
Everything tells us the same story,

455
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:46,860
from Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett’s
Charge to the Battle of Mars La Tours...

456
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,200
The first attack can and
should be the decisive one.

457
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,361
- Perkins...
- Yes, sir!

458
00:49:51,362 --> 00:49:52,749
No excuses, no mistakes

459
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,654
Every horse groomed and
fit for presentation!

460
00:49:54,655 --> 00:49:56,700
I want a full practice charge tomorrow.

461
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,473
Sir.

462
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,250
Thought you two had bottled out.

463
00:50:08,644 --> 00:50:09,552
As if.

464
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,380
All right, then, let’s see what you
two jokers are made of, shall we?

465
00:50:16,528 --> 00:50:18,474
This is what
quiet confidence looks like.

466
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:20,421
I’ll wait for you two
at the Duke of York.

467
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:24,512
Over to you, Captain Nicholls.

468
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,769
Draw... swords!

469
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:35,861
Give... point!

470
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:38,753
Charge!

471
00:50:58,077 --> 00:51:00,009
Come on, Joey.
I know you’ve got it.

472
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,509
Come on, boy! Come on!

473
00:51:17,428 --> 00:51:18,227
Come on, boy!

474
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:32,093
Whoa. Whoa.

475
00:51:37,301 --> 00:51:38,667
Nice of you to turn up.

476
00:51:38,702 --> 00:51:42,289
He’s got speed... I’ll give him that.
But has he got stamina?

477
00:51:42,324 --> 00:51:43,543
He has everything.

478
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,830
What are you up to?

479
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:04,880
I’m writing a letter.

480
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,510
With a picture in it?

481
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,060
It’s to the boy who owned Joey.

482
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:14,286
I want to show him
how wonderful he’s looking.

483
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,600
Before we take him away across
the Channel to face a million Germans guns.

484
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:19,612
Yes. Before that...

485
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,750
4 a. m. start tomorrow...

486
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,530
...travelling with the
Dragoon Guards and the Royals.

487
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:27,863
Transport detachment,
they’ll need to be at the docks at 5 am.

488
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:30,401
Check all kit. Battle orders:
No polishing...

489
00:52:30,436 --> 00:52:34,430
...buttons, helmet buckles,
stirrup irons... let ‘em all go dull.

490
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,167
I want nothing to flash in
the sun and give us away.

491
00:52:37,168 --> 00:52:37,734
Of course.

492
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,700
- Charlie...
- Jamie.

493
00:52:42,212 --> 00:52:42,933
Charlie.

494
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:48,630
What do you think of the new cap?

495
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:55,239
Silk lining. I quite like it.

496
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,150
I’m not sure it’s going to make
a lot of difference to the Germans.

497
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,830
Oh, I don’t know about that.

498
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:06,016
Just working out which of
two chaps to shoot... and you thought...

499
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:09,270
Good Lord, one of them really is
wearing a very stylish cap indeed!

500
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,100
You might shoot the
other one instead.

501
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,950
Or, alternatively, think...
I fancy that cap

502
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,760
...and kill you first of all.

503
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,432
Hadn’t thought of that.

504
00:53:35,193 --> 00:53:36,884
France -1914
Quievrechain

505
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,017
That is our target...
the German 11th Division...

506
00:53:54,052 --> 00:53:57,087
...at the moment bivouacked three
miles to the east of the Menin Road.

507
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,232
We have been watching them...

508
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:00,639
...and they have pitched tents for
the night and lit cooking fires.

509
00:54:00,644 --> 00:54:01,368
Knock them out...

510
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:03,423
...and we could slide in
behind the German lines...

511
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:05,310
...and come at them from
the South at Geluveld.

512
00:54:05,879 --> 00:54:06,676
Excellent.

513
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,510
- Numbers?
- About six hundred. Infantry.

514
00:54:09,515 --> 00:54:10,455
Twice our size...

515
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,330
In regiments of horse and men,
the advantage is ours.

516
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,840
And we have surprise on our side.

517
00:54:13,841 --> 00:54:14,994
But the sooner we move, the better,

518
00:54:14,995 --> 00:54:17,020
We have no assurance they’ll
still be there tomorrow morning.

519
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,840
Right. Good. So, today it is.
Charlie, tell the men.

520
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,770
- Salisbury formation?
- Salisbury formation.

521
00:54:24,496 --> 00:54:26,173
We’ll charge through them
and secure the ground behind.

522
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,950
The grass to the left is taller
than we are, it’s perfect cover.

523
00:54:28,951 --> 00:54:30,190
Excellent work, Sergeant Major.

524
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,000
Time spent on reconnaissance
is rarely wasted.

525
00:54:33,154 --> 00:54:33,885
Thank you, Singh.

526
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:35,980
Jamie!

527
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,510
They have no idea we’re coming.

528
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,990
Not having scruples, are you, Jim?

529
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,999
No. I understand
the surprise is everything.

530
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:49,770
But if it must be done,
let’s do it quickly.

531
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,730
Are you alright, Charlie?

532
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,440
Never been better.

533
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:05,390
Literally, never better.

534
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,770
Prepare to mount!

535
00:55:10,382 --> 00:55:11,288
Mount!

536
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,860
Thank you, Standley.

537
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,260
Hey, Joey.

538
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,800
My bonny boy.

539
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,910
You’re all right,
aren’t you, Joey?

540
00:55:36,062 --> 00:55:36,916
Hey?

541
00:56:01,977 --> 00:56:06,092
Gentleman.
It is an honour to ride beside you.

542
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:11,374
Make the Kaiser rue the day
he dared to cross swords with us.

543
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:16,620
Let every man make himself,
his King, his country,

544
00:56:16,786 --> 00:56:19,121
and his fallen comrades proud!

545
00:56:20,893 --> 00:56:21,966
Be brave.

546
00:56:22,918 --> 00:56:25,717
Fear God. Honor the King!

547
00:56:26,032 --> 00:56:28,586
Fear God. Honor the King!

548
00:56:43,845 --> 00:56:46,330
Draw swords!

549
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,950
Good luck, my friends.

550
00:56:57,099 --> 00:56:58,391
Forward, to walk!

551
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:02,280
Walk... march!

552
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:12,669
Forward to canter!

553
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:18,699
Canter... march!

554
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:47,996
Kavallerie!

555
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:57,856
Charge!

556
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:40,003
What? Did you think that a garrison
on open ground would go undefended?

557
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,060
Look at yourself!

558
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,310
Who do you think you are?!

559
01:02:05,582 --> 01:02:06,570
What do we do with the horses?

560
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,299
If they’re injured, shoot them.

561
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:09,761
And the others, sir?

562
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:12,114
The others you round up and take to
base camp, they will pull guns.

563
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,670
You’ll never get fancy horses
like these to pull guns.

564
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,550
- Then shoot them also.
- Sir.

565
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,777
Perhaps we could use some of
them with the ambulances,

566
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,940
to get the injured men off the field.

567
01:02:23,395 --> 01:02:25,730
- Will they take the harness?
- I’d like to try, sir.

568
01:02:31,132 --> 01:02:32,784
It won’t work... they’re cavalry.

569
01:02:32,785 --> 01:02:34,559
- Let’s try.
- You won’t get the harness on.

570
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,573
Come on, Michael.

571
01:02:35,608 --> 01:02:38,594
Whoa, whoa. Easy, now,

572
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:41,385
Easy now, Englishman.
Easy.

573
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:43,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

574
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,673
Whoa, easy, easy.

575
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:48,361
Easy, easy now.

576
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:50,380
Gunther!

577
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,980
It’s hopeless.
We can’t help them.

578
01:03:19,451 --> 01:03:20,740
Well, well, look at you.

579
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,890
Whoever taught you this
has just saved your life.

580
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:08,620
Hello the farm!

581
01:04:10,296 --> 01:04:11,597
Hello, Si Easton!

582
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,680
I was at the post office...

583
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:16,358
...and while I was there,
Mrs. Allen said...

584
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,300
...a parcel had come
for Albert, from the -

585
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,020
From the -

586
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:23,820
From over there
and I thought...

587
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,530
...I could go up that way in the
morning. And, here it is.

588
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:30,900
Well, who’d be sending me
a parcel over there?

589
01:04:31,854 --> 01:04:33,249
Well, open it and see.

590
01:04:45,626 --> 01:04:46,905
It’s a sketchbook...

591
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,260
That’s Captain Nicholls’ sketchbook!

592
01:04:52,759 --> 01:04:54,480
See that?
That’s a picture of Joey!

593
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,210
It’s a picture of Joey.

594
01:04:57,076 --> 01:04:58,249
Well, I never!

595
01:04:58,705 --> 01:04:59,635
And there’s a letter...

596
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,200
Well, go on then, go on.

597
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:04,728
Dear Albert Narracott.

598
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:06,430
Captain Nicholls, who died...

599
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:13,006
Captain Nicholls, who died in action
today left you this. Yours, Sergeant Sam Perkins.

600
01:05:13,529 --> 01:05:15,454
You weren’t to know it was bad news.

601
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,238
He was riding Joey when he died.

602
01:05:17,628 --> 01:05:18,940
You don’t know that he was riding him...

603
01:05:19,386 --> 01:05:20,456
In action, it says.

604
01:06:15,163 --> 01:06:16,220
Gentlemen!

605
01:06:18,494 --> 01:06:21,279
We move forward to the frontline tonight.

606
01:06:23,089 --> 01:06:25,098
Full marching orders.

607
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,120
Get moving!

608
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,030
Schroeder! Schroeder!

609
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,510
No, not you... you. Come.

610
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,159
I’m keeping you here.
You are best with the horses...

611
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,755
...and we need to move
the camp quickly...

612
01:06:38,756 --> 01:06:40,720
...if the enemy continue to
push through from the west.

613
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,590
- They’re pushing through?
- I’m told.

614
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:46,738
We will move later when we find
where the horses are needed most.

615
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:47,727
Yes, sir.

616
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,440
Perhaps I can keep
my brother here with me,

617
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:50,920
he’s also very good with horses.

618
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,205
Oh, no, no. Not necessary.

619
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,130
Get moving. We leave tonight.

620
01:07:03,036 --> 01:07:04,054
It’s all right, Gunther.

621
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:13,470
You are not going.
I’ll tell them you are only 14,

622
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,504
- That you’re a boy.
- Father signed me in.

623
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:19,040
He knew my age,
and so do they.

624
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,130
Mother obviously never
taught you how to fold a shirt.

625
01:07:25,165 --> 01:07:27,095
Of course she did.
I just wasn’t listening.

626
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:30,120
But you need to listen now!
I promised her...

627
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,635
I made her a solemn promise,

628
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:36,520
that you would be safe with me.
With me, Michael!

629
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,702
They’ll never make a head count.

630
01:07:42,703 --> 01:07:44,740
There are too many of us.
You can stay here.

631
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,430
Slip underneath the bed,
until they move out.

632
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:50,040
Then what?

633
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,180
Gunther, it will be fine.

634
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,170
And when all the
machines break down

635
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,170
and they call up the horses,

636
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,390
I’ll see you at the front.

637
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,270
We’ll be together again.

638
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,080
Gunther...

639
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,310
I’m giving this to you. For luck.

640
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,750
To keep you safe.

641
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,310
Im schnellschritt!

642
01:08:42,345 --> 01:08:44,545
Marsch... links!

643
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,690
Zwei, drei, vier! Left!

644
01:08:46,725 --> 01:08:48,690
Zwei, drei, vier!

645
01:09:56,349 --> 01:09:58,643
Get back in line! Line!

646
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:31,900
I’m hungry.

647
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,260
- Did you bring food?
- I’m sorry.

648
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,280
Will Father be ashamed?

649
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,150
He will pretend to be.

650
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,190
Maybe at first he will be.

651
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,800
But in the end, he will be glad.

652
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,820
And us?

653
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,370
What about us?

654
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:06,490
I was ready to go.

655
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,210
I was proud to go.

656
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:16,740
I wanted to go.

657
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:28,340
The food in Italy is good.

658
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,000
Yes.

659
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,870
What about the women?

660
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,460
Not as good as the food.

661
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,460
Because...

662
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:42,480
They’ve eaten too much of the food?

663
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,720
You are too young for war.

664
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:49,210
- And you’re too young for women!
- I don’t feel so young.

665
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,805
- Not anymore.
- Michael.

666
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,470
- What?
- Go to sleep

667
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,520
We have a big night
of riding ahead.

668
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,800
Goodnight, Michael.

669
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,260
Night night, Gunther.

670
01:12:39,849 --> 01:12:41,149
Hei! In die windmühle!

671
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,290
- Go, go, go...
- Okay.

672
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:11,960
- Schroeder.
- Yes, sir.

673
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,050
A mistake?

674
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,090
A promise.

675
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,110
Ja...

676
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,120
Grandpére.

677
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,220
It’s closer today.

678
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,760
The wind plays tricks with the noise,
It’s moving away from us.

679
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,610
I can hear it, Grandpére,
and there is no wind.

680
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,600
You shouldn’t lie to me.

681
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:23,930
Here. There is no wind here.
But over there...

682
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,470
A wind so strong it
will lift you off the ground...

683
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,280
You lie about everything.

684
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,580
You say you aren’t worried
but it’s clear you are.

685
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,065
I know the war is approaching,

686
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:42,110
But you say, "Oh, it’s
just a trick of the wind."

687
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,455
Did I say that?

688
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:47,350
You started lying when
Mama and Papa went away.

689
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,380
They’re dead.

690
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,760
But you won’t say so.

691
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,250
Do you think I’ll die
if you tell me the truth?

692
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:57,890
The truth is...

693
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:02,560
...you should speak to
your elders with respect.

694
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,210
If you tell me the
truth about the war,

695
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:17,270
I will tell you the truth
about the big horses,

696
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,850
I’ve been keeping
in the windmill.

697
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:24,220
Now, who is the one telling lies!

698
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:28,980
- In the windmill?
- Yes.

699
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:32,300
They were standing in the
windmill waiting for Don Quixote.

700
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:35,730
This is François and this is Claude.

701
01:16:35,765 --> 01:16:36,665
Yeah.

702
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,450
I named them after two boys
who broke my heart last Summer.

703
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:41,240
They must belong to someone.

704
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:44,530
Horses like this don’t just
appear from a fairy-tale.

705
01:16:44,565 --> 01:16:47,640
Yes, I know, Grandpére.
They are not unicorns.

706
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,200
So I will be fair and wait...

707
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:51,530
- ...one day.
- Emilie... Emilie...

708
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:54,390
And if no one comes to
get them by night-time,

709
01:16:54,425 --> 01:16:56,982
- Emilie...
- Then they belong to me.

710
01:16:57,017 --> 01:16:59,200
Emilie. Look at me.

711
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:02,975
You cannot ride.

712
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,592
Mother used to tell me how
my bones would give way...

713
01:17:05,627 --> 01:17:08,080
- Yes. That’s right.
- ...with the slightest bump or fall.

714
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,590
So it is settled?

715
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,060
Good girl.

716
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:19,290
It will only be settled when
I decide which one to ride first.

717
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,060
But it’s -

718
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,975
Over my dead body!

719
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:26,470
At least I won’t have long to wait.

720
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:49,990
I was in love with a boy called
François, who had your lovely eyes.

721
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:53,130
Unfortunately he was in love
with a girl called Marie,

722
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:54,395
Who had your teeth.

723
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:57,672
She fell for a boy called Claude,
who broke my heart.

724
01:17:57,697 --> 01:17:59,430
And who I intend to marry one day.

725
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,200
Eyes on me.

726
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,410
No talking.

727
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,620
Today, we learn to jump.

728
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,969
Did you know the French
cleared one meter eightyfive...

729
01:18:15,004 --> 01:18:16,880
...at the Paris Olympics
to win the gold medal?

730
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:19,920
Today, we will beat that record.

731
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:24,670
This is your jump.

732
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,920
When I call you,
be very brave and leap over it.

733
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,340
Leap over it! Watch me.

734
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:39,680
And now it’s your -

735
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:21,295
He doesn’t think we can do it.

736
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:23,360
But we will show him, won’t we?

737
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,710
No need to be afraid.

738
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:45,060
You are... very tall.

739
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:49,490
You’ll kill yourself.

740
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,990
Only if you get in my way
to make me fall.

741
01:19:52,025 --> 01:19:54,130
Oh please, come off the ladd-

742
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,160
Find somewhere to hide them.

743
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,160
And do it quickly!

744
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,914
Halt! Und aussteigen!

745
01:20:40,483 --> 01:20:41,655
Und aussteigen!

746
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:51,970
My name is Bonnard,
This is my land. Why are you here?

747
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:55,090
Food for the soldiers at the front.

748
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,390
Everyone must give their share.

749
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,250
They are taking everything.

750
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:25,640
Where are the horses?

751
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,330
What horses?

752
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,683
- What is it?
- Leave it...

753
01:21:41,718 --> 01:21:43,740
...if you don’t know what it’s for.

754
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:46,900
A pot is a pot.
We’ll find some use for it.

755
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,620
Sir, where’s the livestock?

756
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:53,390
I make jam.
We have no animals.

757
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:55,520
But there’s fresh hay in your barn.

758
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:58,830
We use it to replace
the mattress stuffings.

759
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,515
- Her grandfather?
- Yes.

760
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:09,550
- Where are her parents?
- They’re dead.

761
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:12,630
They died.

762
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,175
What is that?

763
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:19,350
The wind.
It plays tricks in the attic.

764
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:22,130
There is no wind.

765
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,490
An old house creaks.

766
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,790
Go, close the shutters.

767
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,030
She’s sickly, no?

768
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:42,000
If you or any of your friends harm her,

769
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:45,400
as old as I am, I will kill you.

770
01:22:54,831 --> 01:22:55,720
You know,

771
01:22:56,590 --> 01:22:58,770
I was going to
give you back your pot.

772
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,720
But now I’m going to keep it.

773
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,980
For soup.

774
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:10,230
We will be back in the new season.

775
01:23:35,861 --> 01:23:37,406
Tell me what happened to them.

776
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,341
To my mother and father.

777
01:23:43,464 --> 01:23:45,442
You said you would
tell me how they died,

778
01:23:47,247 --> 01:23:48,717
On my birthday.

779
01:23:49,312 --> 01:23:51,659
And tomorrow’s my birthday!

780
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:58,290
They died fighting, didn’t they?

781
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,305
But when the soldiers come...

782
01:24:02,585 --> 01:24:04,607
...you do nothing.

783
01:24:05,944 --> 01:24:08,118
- You are a coward, aren’t you?
- Yes. Yes.

784
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,400
It was your parents
who were brave.

785
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,980
I make jams.

786
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:19,015
And you’ve never done
a brave thing in your life?

787
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:28,289
Maybe there are
different ways to be brave.

788
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,600
Did you know the French
have the best carrier pigeons?

789
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:39,050
And this could be
the difference in the war,

790
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,590
our messages getting through.

791
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,000
I don’t want to hear
about the birds.

792
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:53,800
They are released at the front
and told to go home.

793
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,300
This is all they know.

794
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:02,100
But to get there
they must fly over a war.

795
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,800
Can you imagine such a thing?

796
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:12,300
Here you are flying over
so much pain and terror,

797
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,000
and you know
you can never look down.

798
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,700
You have to look forward
or you’ll never get home.

799
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,400
I ask you, What could be
braver than that?

800
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,800
- What is that?
- A present.

801
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,433
I hope you have not
bought me a disgusting dress...

802
01:26:08,468 --> 01:26:10,400
...that I then have to wear like last year.

803
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,900
- It was disgusting?
- Yes.

804
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,300
I looked like an ugly nun.

805
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,300
Give me your hand.

806
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,800
Grandpére, we have no money.

807
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,700
When the war is over, then you can
buy me jewels and carriages.

808
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,100
Anything you say, my sweet one.
Anything-you-say!

809
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,800
You are, of course, the boss.

810
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,348
It’s just an old thing I found...

811
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,700
...don’t worry yourself
leave it, I’ll put it back.

812
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,800
It was your mother’s.

813
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,400
I hid it, so as not to encourage you.

814
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,900
Emilie, I want you to ride
very slowly, very carefully.

815
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,448
- And promise me you won’t go far...
- Of course.

816
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,515
To the top of the hill
and straight back again.

817
01:27:25,516 --> 01:27:26,690
I promise.

818
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,300
My hero.

819
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,300
Slowly... slowly...

820
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,500
Emilie!

821
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,600
Emilie!

822
01:28:23,186 --> 01:28:24,330
No!

823
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:32,300
- Let go of me!
- She is my granddaughter!

824
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,100
Emilie, stop!
Don’t hurt her, please!

825
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,400
Don’t hurt her.

826
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,900
You don’t need them!
There are so many others!

827
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,700
Please, take the bigger one
and leave the smaller one.

828
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,100
You are breaking
my granddaughter’s heart.

829
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,600
The war has taken
everything from everyone.

830
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,551
What will happen to them?

831
01:29:01,552 --> 01:29:03,900
They will pull artillery
until they die...

832
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,100
- François!
- ...or until the war is over.

833
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:09,200
It will never be over!

834
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,300
You have your answer then.

835
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,683
Heiglemann...

836
01:29:52,369 --> 01:29:54,100
- These are yours.
- Yes, sir.

837
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,500
They look strong,
should last a month or two.

838
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,900
You are beautiful.

839
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,200
It’s a pity they found you.

840
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,300
Such a pity...

841
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,800
Pull together!

842
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:58,100
Halt! Halt! Stop!

843
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:01,253
Stop! Stop!

844
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:20,814
Heiglemann, bring up another one!

845
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:23,000
Heiglemann, bring up another horse!

846
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:26,028
That one!

847
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:34,369
No, no. The big black one!

848
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,807
He’s a good horse, sir.

849
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,810
But if you move him up to the heavy gun,
he will be no use at all.

850
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:00,229
Prince is already losing condition.

851
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,750
His leg, sir.

852
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:03,623
- You have given them names?
- Yes, sir.

853
01:32:04,032 --> 01:32:06,748
You should never give a name to
anything you are certain to lose.

854
01:32:06,749 --> 01:32:08,654
But, His leg is not good enough, sir.

855
01:32:08,862 --> 01:32:11,949
Private, you will do as you are told.

856
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:13,283
Hook him up.

857
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:25,800
As you see, sir,
this one is stronger.

858
01:32:26,797 --> 01:32:28,006
Hook him up.

859
01:32:32,501 --> 01:32:33,924
Come, come, come

860
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:04,044
Halt! Halt!

861
01:34:06,063 --> 01:34:07,314
Take the horses away!

862
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:17,741
Shell!

863
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,043
And load!

864
01:34:33,715 --> 01:34:36,593
Back! Case!

865
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:43,308
Position!

866
01:34:49,585 --> 01:34:53,318
And... fire!

867
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:33,262
Valuables in the bucket, lads.

868
01:35:33,263 --> 01:35:35,611
If you live, you’ll get them back.

869
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,198
If you live, you’ll get them back.
Good lads.

870
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,618
Valuables in the bucket.
Fine.

871
01:35:59,927 --> 01:36:02,638
Maybe it’s a drill, Albie.
Maybe it’s a drill like last time.

872
01:36:07,768 --> 01:36:09,019
Love letter?

873
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,107
That’s my business.

874
01:36:15,442 --> 01:36:20,280
I hear you and your mate
were doing bird imitations again.

875
01:36:21,698 --> 01:36:23,784
You gonna write a letter to your horse?

876
01:36:24,493 --> 01:36:26,078
After you find your horse,

877
01:36:26,161 --> 01:36:29,248
I’ve lost my needle in a haystack,
and I could use some help.

878
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:35,045
Anything valuable. Anyone who
comes back gets to share it out.

879
01:36:36,505 --> 01:36:37,900
Stay here.

880
01:36:40,676 --> 01:36:42,678
Remember that day me and Joey
raced you in your car?

881
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:45,806
I remember you
somersaulting through the air.

882
01:36:45,889 --> 01:36:47,641
Who was that girl you were with?

883
01:36:48,475 --> 01:36:49,685
There was a girl?

884
01:36:49,977 --> 01:36:52,638
There was.
Don’t you remember?

885
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,983
It was just some girl, I suppose.
I don’t recall which one.

886
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:00,112
I do remember you
falling on your bum in a ditch.

887
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,071
You see?

888
01:37:02,107 --> 01:37:05,742
Always entertaining, Narracott,
I’ll give you that.

889
01:37:06,743 --> 01:37:09,371
You did that?
You fell on your bum?

890
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,467
In the positions.

891
01:37:28,557 --> 01:37:30,392
Get ready. Get ready, boys.

892
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:34,301
Be ready! Be ready!
Let’s go, men!

893
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:42,425
Hold your nerve, boys. Remember,
it’s not too far to go. There’s a way through.

894
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:46,199
Run fast, keep your wits
about you, keep your eyes open...

895
01:37:46,234 --> 01:37:47,784
...and God and the King
will keep an eye on you.

896
01:37:47,868 --> 01:37:51,288
Company will fix bayonets!
Fix bayonets!

897
01:37:52,706 --> 01:37:54,625
- You know what it reminds me of out there?
- What?

898
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:57,461
That bloody impossible lower field
the day me and Joey plowed it.

899
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,130
Best day of my life that was
and you were there.

900
01:38:01,799 --> 01:38:04,551
And this here is the worst day
of my life, about to begin,

901
01:38:04,676 --> 01:38:07,846
and you’re here cheering me on.
Us two, always.

902
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,082
And him.

903
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:11,832
Once you’re in no man’s land,
go to the flanks.

904
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,143
- Stay on the flanks.
- Yes, sir.

905
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:14,436
Come on, boys, come on.
To the ladder!

906
01:38:14,478 --> 01:38:17,189
Stick close to the gentry, yeah?
That’s our ticket.

907
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,320
We have the pluck
but they have the luck.

908
01:38:19,355 --> 01:38:20,840
Come on, boys.
Keep going, keep going.

909
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:22,894
Andrew.

910
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:25,572
You, too, Narracott.
And you, too.

911
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:47,109
Come on, on your ladders, boy.
On your ladders.

912
01:38:47,144 --> 01:38:48,512
In you go, in you go.
That’s it.

913
01:38:50,889 --> 01:38:52,933
Listen to your sergeant!

914
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:55,000
If anybody turns back,

915
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,021
If any one of our boys...

916
01:38:58,105 --> 01:39:01,775
...come running towards you
you take this rifle...

917
01:39:02,234 --> 01:39:04,444
...and you shoot them dead.

918
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:07,200
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

919
01:39:07,531 --> 01:39:08,641
Do you understand me?

920
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:11,064
Do you understand
what I’m telling you, son?

921
01:39:11,099 --> 01:39:13,453
You take this rifle
and you shoot them dead.

922
01:39:13,912 --> 01:39:15,038
Understand?

923
01:39:18,401 --> 01:39:21,962
Up there, son. Up your ladder.
Up your ladder to your work!

924
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,662
It’s good.
Andrew, it’s good.

925
01:39:24,832 --> 01:39:28,260
Andrew!
Nobody’s retreating today.

926
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,764
Andrew! Andrew!
Nobody is retreating today.

927
01:41:03,267 --> 01:41:05,232
Just leave me. Leave me!

928
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:21,081
You’ll be all right here.

929
01:41:21,373 --> 01:41:23,459
You’ll be safe.
Someone’ll come for ya.

930
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,325
Albert. Albert, listen...

931
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:31,258
It’s all right. It’s all right.
We’re Devon boys, yeah?

932
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,554
Yeah...

933
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:58,262
Get down!

934
01:44:30,771 --> 01:44:32,105
No!

935
01:44:36,485 --> 01:44:37,611
Albie.

936
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,083
We made it.

937
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:53,794
We made it.

938
01:45:07,558 --> 01:45:09,893
Andrew, this way out!

939
01:45:11,478 --> 01:45:13,021
Gas! Gas! Gas!

940
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:18,193
Albie...

941
01:45:49,316 --> 01:45:52,869
Hey, there’s no stopping here.
Keep them moving.

942
01:45:52,904 --> 01:45:56,440
Sir, there’s something wrong.
This one needs to rest.

943
01:45:56,523 --> 01:45:59,485
There’s no rest for them.
Move them along.

944
01:45:59,568 --> 01:46:00,944
Move them along!

945
01:46:21,407 --> 01:46:22,697
Please, please, please.

946
01:46:23,048 --> 01:46:26,385
Stay on your feet.
No, please. No no no...

947
01:46:30,001 --> 01:46:31,516
Please, please...

948
01:46:31,859 --> 01:46:32,859
Stay on your feet.

949
01:46:33,301 --> 01:46:36,244
Come on. Please, please...

950
01:46:36,245 --> 01:46:37,549
Stay on your feet.

951
01:47:34,841 --> 01:47:36,781
They’re coming! Leave it, private!

952
01:47:36,816 --> 01:47:38,658
Leave it! Come with me!

953
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:40,600
Go to hell!

954
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,700
Run. Run!

955
01:47:47,843 --> 01:47:50,846
Run! Run!

956
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,514
Run!

957
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,418
Stand to, stand to...

958
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,088
There’s something moving.

959
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,340
What the hell is it?

960
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,011
It looks like a cow.

961
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:21,682
What the hell would
a cow be doing out there?

962
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,689
That definitely isn’t a cow.

963
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:30,970
Well, what is it?

964
01:51:31,191 --> 01:51:34,212
It can’t be a horse. Nothing
alive could be out there.

965
01:51:34,247 --> 01:51:37,075
It isn’t a horse.
It isn’t a horse.

966
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:41,410
Yes, it’s a horse.

967
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,913
- It’s a horse.
- Yeah, it’s a horse.

968
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,623
Well, bugger me.

969
01:51:47,749 --> 01:51:49,084
It’s a horse.

970
01:51:53,797 --> 01:51:55,466
Lads, we should call him.

971
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,177
How do you call a horse?

972
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:42,262
He’s caught on the wire.

973
01:52:47,423 --> 01:52:48,723
Oh sod it...

974
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,200
What do you think you’re doing?

975
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:00,900
Get back, do you hear me?

976
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,617
Corporal, that’s an order!
Get back!

977
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:07,204
Listen to him, sir.
We can’t leave him.

978
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:11,458
- What’s he doing?
- It’s a trap.

979
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,002
No, I don’t think so.

980
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,797
- I think he’s trying to help.
- Scare him back into his hole.

981
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,348
It’s a white flag, ent it?

982
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:28,725
You see the white flag!?

983
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,104
I’m just after tending to
this here horse, is all!

984
01:53:36,483 --> 01:53:38,861
Get back, you stupid git!

985
01:53:40,279 --> 01:53:43,907
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want,

986
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:47,411
He leadeth me into green pastures,

987
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:52,416
He lay me down
beside the still waters...

988
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:08,682
Poor beastie.

989
01:54:10,434 --> 01:54:11,852
Poor babbie.

990
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:13,395
It’s alright.

991
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:16,023
It’s alright.
Don’t buck and wriggle so,

992
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:19,234
You’re only shredding yourself.

993
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,863
You’ll blind yourself.

994
01:54:25,908 --> 01:54:29,203
Bugger me worthless. I didn’t think
to bring gloves or something to cut the

995
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:36,210
I thought perhaps you might need
these.

996
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:37,961
For the barbed wire?

997
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:43,967
Yeah, yeah I... Ummm, thanks.

998
01:54:45,135 --> 01:54:46,261
Cheers.

999
01:54:47,304 --> 01:54:49,473
Cheers...
Thanks.

1000
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:01,026
That... That’s a very long strand.

1001
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:02,402
When you cut it,

1002
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,488
it’s going to release

1003
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:07,825
this

1004
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:09,326
and this, and this,

1005
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:11,370
and they’ll
coil back rather violently,

1006
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,705
which I’m afraid will only wound the poor
fellow further.

1007
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,583
You speak good English.

1008
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:19,837
I speak English well.

1009
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,381
May I?

1010
01:55:33,809 --> 01:55:35,936
What if we cut his head free first?

1011
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:38,480
So he won’t try to stand up and
blind himself?

1012
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,899
- And then...
- Pity you didn’t bring a second pair.

1013
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,818
Then I could cut the wire here

1014
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,362
WE NEED MORE WIRE CUTTERS!

1015
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,584
His blind spot.

1016
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,295
The cutters won’t frighten him.

1017
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,174
If you could cut
here, holding this wire...

1018
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:08,510
- I could...
- Say no more, I’m right behind you.

1019
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:12,222
And you understand what’s happening,
do you not, O Best Beloved?

1020
01:56:12,306 --> 01:56:14,892
That you
must lay so very nice and still.

1021
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,435
There’s a lad,

1022
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:19,021
you’re a remarkable horse, you are,

1023
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:21,273
helping us help you.

1024
01:56:21,325 --> 01:56:22,441
There’s a lad.

1025
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:24,693
There’s a remarkable lad.

1026
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,033
So how’s things in yonder trench?

1027
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:35,412
Delightful. We read, we knit
sweaters,

1028
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,415
and we train our rats to
perform circus tricks.

1029
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:40,709
Well, if ever you need any more
rats, we can always send ours over.

1030
01:56:40,793 --> 01:56:42,836
‘Cause we’ve more than we need,
strictly speaking.

1031
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:48,717
- Besides, they scare off all the pretty girls.
- Our girls aren’t afraid of rats.

1032
01:56:50,052 --> 01:56:51,804
Big strapping German girls, eh?

1033
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,723
Kind what gives robust massages?

1034
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:58,268
Every Thursday!

1035
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,562
And they bring rum
cake on your birthday.

1036
01:57:20,833 --> 01:57:22,209
Look at that horse!

1037
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:24,795
Look at the
muscles he’s got,

1038
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:28,298
them long legs.
They’re made for running, horses.

1039
01:57:28,299 --> 01:57:29,967
Runnin’ away from danger.

1040
01:57:31,885 --> 01:57:33,554
Running away is all they have.

1041
01:57:34,096 --> 01:57:35,597
Yet we taught ‘em opposite.

1042
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:37,933
Running into the fray.

1043
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:41,228
- War horse
- Yeah.

1044
01:57:42,688 --> 01:57:44,231
War horse.

1045
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,108
And there he is.

1046
01:57:47,067 --> 01:57:49,361
What a strange beast you’ve become.

1047
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:52,698
And now?

1048
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,658
I take him back with me, yeah?

1049
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,600
Since I supplied the cutters, the
horse is mine.

1050
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:59,700
This is fair, no?

1051
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:02,374
In a pig’s eye. He’s English, plain to see.

1052
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,793
- Oh, you mean because he’s so filthy?
- Because he’s so smart.

1053
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,878
And you’re
none too clean yourself.

1054
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:11,216
We could box.

1055
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:13,260
And the winner gets
the horse.

1056
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:17,264
No, thanks, pet.

1057
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:19,600
Must be careful not
to start a war.

1058
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,604
Do you have a coin of any sort?

1059
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:26,690
- Coin toss?
- Yeah.

1060
01:58:30,486 --> 01:58:32,821
- All right, Fritz you’re on.
- My name is not Fritz

1061
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:34,948
it is Peter.

1062
01:58:36,533 --> 01:58:38,035
Peter I’m Colin.

1063
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,204
- You call it, Colin.
- Heads.

1064
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,795
That’s the face of my Kaiser

1065
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:49,880
and he does not
look pleased with me.

1066
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,884
The horse is yours.

1067
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:56,595
Gone quiet, hasn’t it?

1068
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:58,222
Yes.

1069
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:00,849
But wait half an hour and we’ll be shooting
again.

1070
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:05,145
I’m a terrible shot, Pete, don’t believe
I’ll ever hit the target.

1071
01:59:07,147 --> 01:59:08,398
Thanks

1072
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:11,652
Cheerio, mate.

1073
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:14,438
- You’ll take good care of him, yes?
- I will.

1074
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:15,918
Our strange beast.

1075
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:18,000
And you take care of your own
strange self.

1076
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,160
Colin!

1077
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,413
A pair of German cutters

1078
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:26,041
in memory
of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf.

1079
01:59:26,083 --> 01:59:27,126
Thanks.

1080
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,294
I’ll use ‘em back in the garden in
South Shields.

1081
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:32,172
You keep your head
down, now, Pete me lad!

1082
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:37,260
Remarkable! A remarkable horse!

1083
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,925
We’re full up. Move on.

1084
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:24,558
The gas got him

1085
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,810
we had to wait till morning.

1086
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,608
This can’t be all of us.

1087
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:33,817
This is all.

1088
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:35,986
All walking wounded,

1089
02:00:36,487 --> 02:00:39,239
away to the dressing station!

1090
02:00:39,781 --> 02:00:43,160
Away to the dressing station!

1091
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:23,158
- What’s this doing here?
- We need a vet, sir.

1092
02:01:23,242 --> 02:01:25,536
There are no vets. We’ve scarcely
any horses left.

1093
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,080
He’s cut all over, but this leg
here’s got the worst of it.

1094
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:38,200
- It’s probably tetanus. It’s no good.
- Please, sir

1095
02:01:38,257 --> 02:01:40,676
I’ve all these men to take care of,
corporal, you can see that, can’t you?

1096
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:43,470
Please, sir, this horse can pull
through anything.

1097
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,275
What is it?

1098
02:01:57,200 --> 02:01:59,528
It’s a horse they found, wandering about in
No Man’s Land.

1099
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,905
- Down you go.
- What kind of an horse?

1100
02:02:01,989 --> 02:02:04,741
Bloody miraculous kind of an horse,
be my guess.

1101
02:02:04,825 --> 02:02:07,077
Nothing makes it out
of No Man’s Land.

1102
02:02:12,458 --> 02:02:14,084
Miraculous horse..

1103
02:02:16,503 --> 02:02:19,047
He was alive, y’see, sir, where
nothing survives,

1104
02:02:19,131 --> 02:02:20,549
so to me and me mates,

1105
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,259
to the men, sir, he’s

1106
02:02:22,260 --> 02:02:25,053
- Well, we have high hopes for him -
- You should shoot him now.

1107
02:02:26,388 --> 02:02:29,308
- Oh, but I can’t.
- It’d be a mercy, lad,

1108
02:02:29,516 --> 02:02:31,101
that leg’s not going to mend.

1109
02:02:31,685 --> 02:02:32,895
Sergeant.

1110
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,398
Put him out of his misery.

1111
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:50,100
Ladies, if you please.

1112
02:02:56,293 --> 02:02:58,420
All right, back off.

1113
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,380
Back off.

1114
02:04:11,785 --> 02:04:13,328
Go on. Do it again.

1115
02:04:21,545 --> 02:04:22,880
Joey?

1116
02:04:42,065 --> 02:04:43,317
Hello, Joey.

1117
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:45,903
Where you been then, hey?

1118
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,400
Where in the world you been?

1119
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:50,199
Do you know this man?

1120
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:53,200
- What’s your name?
- Narracot.

1121
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:56,497
- Private Albert Narracott, sir.
- This is a random horse, Narracott,

1122
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:58,415
and too badly injured.

1123
02:04:58,700 --> 02:05:00,375
- Is this man in your care?
- Yes, sir.

1124
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:01,919
He’s not random at all, sir!

1125
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:03,337
He’s my horse,

1126
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:05,255
I raised him, in Devon. Sir,

1127
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:07,800
look at his legs!

1128
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:09,968
He’s got four
white socks,

1129
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:13,889
he’s brown all over and he has a
white mark here like so

1130
02:05:17,300 --> 02:05:18,769
Take him back.

1131
02:05:18,852 --> 02:05:21,897
- Come on, son.
- Wait! You can’t see ‘cause of the mud.

1132
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:57,349
Four white socks!

1133
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:56,784
All right, break it up. Clear off,
the lot of ya.

1134
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,994
You see, sir?

1135
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:01,037
He’s not random at all.

1136
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,292
We will attend to your horse.

1137
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:08,170
Patch him up best we can.

1138
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,839
Treat him like
the soldier he is.

1139
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:13,175
Thank you, sir.

1140
02:07:39,868 --> 02:07:40,994
Gentlemen!

1141
02:07:41,912 --> 02:07:43,080
Gentlemen!

1142
02:07:43,122 --> 02:07:46,166
It falls on me to give
you some important news.

1143
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,293
At eleven o’clock today,

1144
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:50,087
in two minutes time

1145
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,464
the War will come to an end.

1146
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:56,969
The King and Queen thank you for your
service.

1147
02:07:57,800 --> 02:07:59,388
We have been victorious

1148
02:07:59,700 --> 02:08:03,100
even if at a higher price than
many of us might have imagined.

1149
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:05,269
When the bells ring out

1150
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:08,480
and they will in a moment,
for the first time for four years

1151
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:11,901
let us remember our brothers fallen in the
field.

1152
02:08:12,276 --> 02:08:16,358
And thank God for the end of this
struggle and victory.

1153
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:33,172
I don’t understand, sir.

1154
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:36,967
Officers’ horses only.

1155
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:39,595
All other horses are to be auctioned
immediately.

1156
02:08:39,678 --> 02:08:41,597
That is a complete and bloody outrage.

1157
02:08:41,638 --> 02:08:43,974
It’s the lad’s horse, sir, from Devon.

1158
02:08:44,183 --> 02:08:45,851
He raised him up from a pup, he did.

1159
02:08:45,934 --> 02:08:48,896
Trained him right up to the day when
the army came to town.

1160
02:08:48,937 --> 02:08:51,273
These aren’t my orders, sergeant.

1161
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:55,068
You’ll have to take him to market.

1162
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:57,362
That’s all.

1163
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:23,700
We’ve all clubbed together.

1164
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,183
It’s everything we have.

1165
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:30,687
There’s twenty-nine pounds there.
Buy him back.

1166
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,946
- Does the Major know?
- The Major put in ten.

1167
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:42,491
Mum’s the word where the Major’s
concerned. Your friend on the crutches over there

1168
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:45,952
even asked the Major to say that
Joey was his, an officer’s horse,

1169
02:09:46,036 --> 02:09:47,700
so that he could go back with the
others.

1170
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:52,918
Come on, Narracott! Get a move on. We don’t
want to miss the show.

1171
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:05,931
Seven pounds! Seven pounds there!

1172
02:10:05,973 --> 02:10:08,600
Seven pounds! Eight pounds here!

1173
02:10:08,684 --> 02:10:11,270
Eight pounds! Ten pounds here!

1174
02:10:11,311 --> 02:10:13,230
Any advance? Sold!

1175
02:10:13,313 --> 02:10:16,234
You’re alright. Nobody’s gonna bid more than
fifteen for a thoroughbred.

1176
02:10:16,434 --> 02:10:18,485
They want work horses.

1177
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:22,406
Next one.

1178
02:10:24,158 --> 02:10:26,160
We start at four pounds.

1179
02:10:26,827 --> 02:10:28,412
Four pounds.

1180
02:10:29,205 --> 02:10:31,581
- 5 pound.
- five pounds here

1181
02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:33,917
Any advance?
- seven pound!

1182
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:36,044
eight pound. eight pound!

1183
02:10:36,086 --> 02:10:37,588
- Nine!
- ten pound!

1184
02:10:37,629 --> 02:10:38,839
Sepuluh pound!

1185
02:10:39,006 --> 02:10:40,674
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

1186
02:10:40,716 --> 02:10:42,176
It’s the butcher from Cambrai.

1187
02:10:42,801 --> 02:10:44,928
He’s been bidding for the best all
morning.

1188
02:10:44,929 --> 02:10:46,229
Eleven. Eleven pounds. Eleven pounds.

1189
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:47,931
Let me handle this, private.

1190
02:10:47,973 --> 02:10:49,308
Fifteen,

1191
02:10:49,683 --> 02:10:51,435
and let that be an end to it.

1192
02:10:51,518 --> 02:10:52,686
Fifteen pounds

1193
02:10:52,728 --> 02:10:54,229
Sixteen.

1194
02:10:54,271 --> 02:10:57,065
- Sixteen pounds
- Seventeen.

1195
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:01,820
Twenty of your English pounds. And let THAT
be the end of it, my friend.

1196
02:11:02,154 --> 02:11:03,405
Twenty pounds.

1197
02:11:04,323 --> 02:11:06,742
- Twenty Five.
- Twenty five pounds.

1198
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,535
Twenty Six.

1199
02:11:08,577 --> 02:11:10,913
- Twenty six pounds.
- Twenty seven.

1200
02:11:10,954 --> 02:11:13,499
- Twenty eight.
- Twenty eight pounds.

1201
02:11:13,624 --> 02:11:14,833
Twenty nine.

1202
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:16,418
And thirty.

1203
02:11:16,502 --> 02:11:18,170
Any advance at thirty pounds?

1204
02:11:18,796 --> 02:11:20,506
One hundred pounds.

1205
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:28,305
And sir, if you bid against me,

1206
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,599
I will sell the coat on my back

1207
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,060
and bid to one hundred
and ten.

1208
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:36,146
And if you bid against me again, I
will sell my farm

1209
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:38,148
and bid to a thousand.

1210
02:11:41,819 --> 02:11:43,403
One hundred pounds.

1211
02:11:45,322 --> 02:11:48,534
Going, going, gone.

1212
02:11:58,210 --> 02:11:59,253
Sir,

1213
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:00,712
I’ll give you all your money.

1214
02:12:00,796 --> 02:12:03,966
Everything you paid when we get back
to England. I’ll give you twice -

1215
02:12:04,049 --> 02:12:05,425
You don’t know anything about him.

1216
02:12:05,509 --> 02:12:07,302
Oh, but you’re wrong, sir, I know
everything!

1217
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:12,015
Yes, you found him! I heard you
found a horse in the wire between the armies...

1218
02:12:12,099 --> 02:12:13,976
No, I found him, he raised him -

1219
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:19,857
When I heard about the miracle
horse, I traveled three days

1220
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:22,359
because I knew whose horse it was.

1221
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:24,987
My granddaughter’s.

1222
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:27,448
She saved his life!

1223
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:29,450
He was everything to her.

1224
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:31,076
Where is your granddaughter?

1225
02:12:31,900 --> 02:12:34,621
The war has taken everything from
everyone.

1226
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,748
He is all that I have left of her.

1227
02:13:00,355 --> 02:13:02,191
Don’t be worried, boy, when I go.

1228
02:13:03,066 --> 02:13:04,943
I won’t worry over you none.

1229
02:13:05,819 --> 02:13:07,321
Hey, I found you, didn’t I,

1230
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,616
and you found me.

1231
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:15,996
And we’ll both...

1232
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:18,623
we’ll both know
that we made it through.

1233
02:13:20,083 --> 02:13:21,376
Now go on.

1234
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:23,754
We’re the lucky ones.

1235
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:25,255
Always have been.

1236
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:27,633
Lucky since the day I met you.

1237
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:32,054
God be with you, sir.

1238
02:13:34,807 --> 02:13:36,475
Do you know what this is?

1239
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:42,564
It’s my father’s.

1240
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:45,317
It’s his regimental pennant.

1241
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:54,076
How did you come
by this, sir?

1242
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:58,205
You may have this.

1243
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,549
Thank you ever so much for this,
sir...

1244
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:14,513
...And this.

1245
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:26,567
No no, not necessary.

1246
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,193
He belongs to you.

1247
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:32,114
That is, of course, what my
little girl would have wanted.

1248
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:34,116
And she was the boss.

1249
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:46,920
What was her name?

1250
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:49,089
Emilie.

1251
02:14:52,759 --> 02:14:54,636
Her name is Emilie.

1252
02:17:56,861 --> 02:18:00,594
War Horse
