1
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,630
<i>Where were you when I laid
the foundations of the earth?</i>

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,630
<i>When the morning stars sang together, and all
the sons of God shouted for joy? (Job 38:4,7)</i>

3
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,001
Brother.

4
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,530
Mother.

5
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:33,581
It was they who
led me to your door.

6
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,981
The nuns taught us there
are two ways through life.

7
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,551
The way of nature.

8
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:13,191
And the way of grace.

9
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,701
You have to choose which one you'll follow.

10
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,441
Grace does not try
to please itself.

11
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:39,421
Accepts being slighted,
forgotten, disliked.

12
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:46,761
Accepts insults and injuries.

13
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,781
Nature only wants to please itself.

14
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,621
But others to please it too.

15
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:16,461
Likes to lordeth over them.

16
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,491
To have its own way.

17
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,701
It finds reasons to be unhappy,

18
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,771
when all the world
is shining around it.

19
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:35,181
And love is smiling
through all things.

20
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,921
They taught us that no one
who loves the way of grace,

21
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,671
ever comes to a bad end.

22
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:06,581
I will be true to you.

23
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:10,611
Whatever comes.

24
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,091
My son.

25
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:45,331
I just want to die. Just be with him.

26
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,141
He's in God's hands now.

27
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,221
He was in God's hands the whole time.

28
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,521
Wasn't he?

29
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:48,601
My all.

30
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,631
My God.

31
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,271
I shall fear no evil.

32
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,651
Fear no evil, for
you are with me.

33
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,621
What did you gain?

34
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:13,591
Be not far from me,
for trouble is near.

35
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,521
Go on now, we're alright.

36
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,491
We're alright.

37
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:30,571
Thank you.

38
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,751
You have your memories of him.

39
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:42,211
You have to be strong now.

40
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:49,361
I know the pain will...
it will pass and time...

41
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,191
It might seem...

42
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,761
hard, my saying that,
but it's true.

43
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:56,921
I don't want it to.

44
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:01,071
Life goes on.

45
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,111
People pass along.

46
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:08,741
Nothing stays the same.

47
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,581
You still got the other two.

48
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,491
The Lord gives and the Lord takes away.

49
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,661
That's the way He is.

50
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,371
He sends flies to wounds
that He should heal.

51
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,461
I never got a chance to
tell him how sorry I was.

52
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:06,831
And I...

53
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:12,641
punched himself in the face for no reason.

54
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,781
He'd sit next to me at the piano and I
criticized where he'd turn the pages.

55
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:45,231
I made him feel shame.

56
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,501
Why shame?

57
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,221
Poor boy.

58
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,881
How did you come to me?

59
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,861
In what shape?

60
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,261
What disguise?

61
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:11,451
I see the child that was.

62
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:23,101
I see my brother.

63
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:27,931
True.

64
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:32,111
Kind.

65
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:41,451
He died when he was nineteen.

66
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:17,181
Just check this one against this.

67
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,381
She wants to get back together.

68
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:22,621
But the chapter is closed,
the story has been told.

69
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,061
What do you do?

70
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:29,021
Experiment.

71
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:37,661
When you're young it's all about your career.
You don't understand anything.

72
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:50,391
I just feel like I'm bumping into walls.

73
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:11,441
The world's gone to the dogs.
People are greedy, keep getting worse.

74
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:18,541
I try to get into their hands.

75
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,851
Hey, dad.
I'm sorry I said what I said.

76
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:42,771
I think about him every day. I just
shouldn't have said what I did and I'm sorry.

77
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:50,271
No, it's just... this day.

78
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,051
What are you thinking?

79
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:55,451
I know you did everything you could.

80
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,771
How did I lose you?

81
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,981
Wandered.

82
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,161
Forgot you.

83
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,381
Find me.

84
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:06,381
How did she bare it?

85
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,561
Mother.

86
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:57,531
Was I false to you?

87
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:46,051
Lord.

88
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:54,661
Why?

89
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:04,571
Where were you?

90
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:07,861
Did you know?

91
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,481
Who are we to you?

92
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:47,431
Answer me.

93
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:01,021
We cry to you.

94
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:08,851
My soul.

95
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,631
My son.

96
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:29,711
Hear us.

97
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:36,131
Life by life.

98
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,411
I search for you.

99
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:47,511
My all.

100
00:34:58,501 --> 00:34:59,991
My child.

101
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:23,171
You spoke to me through her.

102
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:28,421
You spoke with me from the sky.

103
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:32,181
The trees.

104
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:39,121
Before I knew I loved you.

105
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:43,591
Believed in you.

106
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:05,121
When did you first
touch my heart?

107
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,821
What is this?

108
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,861
- Two alligators.
- Two alligators.

109
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:24,171
- Kangaroo.
- Kangaroo.

110
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:36,251
Jump.

111
00:43:42,251 --> 00:43:43,411
Sweetheart.

112
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:47,451
Please.

113
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:51,291
I know.

114
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:53,521
No. No!

115
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:26,161
You found it.

116
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:05,191
You'll be grown before
that tree is tall.

117
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:30,651
Are you afraid?

118
00:45:32,801 --> 00:45:34,061
Come here.

119
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,951
Come back here, son. Stay out of there.

120
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:34,211
You see this line?

121
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:36,521
Let's not cross it, you understand?

122
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:38,991
Do you understand?

123
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:42,031
Do you see this line? Look here.

124
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:47,401
Come back here, son.

125
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:56,371
Stay out of there.

126
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,811
That's where God lives.

127
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,401
I found it. I found this old bone.

128
00:49:08,841 --> 00:49:10,781
- Set it off.
- No.

129
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,611
Bless this food to our use.

130
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:24,341
And us to your loving
and faithful service.

131
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,151
And make us ever mindful
of those who are in need.

132
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:28,491
Amen.

133
00:50:36,371 --> 00:50:38,531
Can you pass the butter, please?

134
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:41,461
Can you pass the
butter, please sir?

135
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:42,801
Sir.

136
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,571
- What did you do today?
- We went to school.

137
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,841
After that.

138
00:50:50,611 --> 00:50:52,241
What about the yard?

139
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:54,641
Did you put the runners in
like I asked?

140
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:57,411
Yes.

141
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,651
Yes, sir.

142
00:51:01,121 --> 00:51:02,681
Well, it didn't look like it.

143
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:20,671
Yes.

144
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,991
Mr. Reese liked
Jack's book report...

145
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:38,791
What is that, sweetheart?

146
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:41,251
You know this.

147
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:52,701
Brahms!

148
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:07,251
- Son.
- Sir.

149
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,351
Reach me my lighter.

150
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:21,131
Haven't you forgotten something?

151
00:52:46,031 --> 00:52:47,591
Do you love your father?

152
00:52:49,201 --> 00:52:50,431
Yes, sir.

153
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:05,941
They found him stretched out on
a warm ledge in the afternoon sun.

154
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:08,921
Admiring his beautiful new coat.

155
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:20,791
Who do you love the most?

156
00:53:26,601 --> 00:53:28,701
I love you all three the same.

157
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:33,711
Tell us a story from
before we can remember.

158
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,851
I went for a ride in a plane once.

159
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:44,951
It was a graduation present.

160
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:01,761
Mother.

161
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,911
Make me good.

162
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:21,891
Brave.

163
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,201
Can it happen to anyone?

164
00:57:30,351 --> 00:57:32,181
Nobody talks about it.

165
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:02,501
Help me be thankful
for everything I've got.

166
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:05,651
Where do you live?

167
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:09,571
Help me not to tell lies.

168
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:18,321
Are you watching me?

169
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,861
I want to know what you are.

170
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:39,811
I want to see what you see.

171
00:59:36,141 --> 00:59:37,471
Come here.

172
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:52,581
You're going to close this
door quietly, fifty times.

173
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:54,391
Count it off.

174
00:59:56,021 --> 00:59:59,361
3, 4, 5,

175
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:03,421
6, 7, 8.

176
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:08,371
You got to get it by the root.

177
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:18,101
Your mother is naive.

178
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,611
It takes fierce will to
get ahead in this world.

179
01:00:22,781 --> 01:00:25,311
If you're good, people will
take adventage of you.

180
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:35,091
Everyone of these top executives.
You know how they got where they are?

181
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:37,561
Floating right down the middle of the river.

182
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:43,271
Don't let anyone tell you
there's anything you can't do.

183
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:48,311
Don't do like I do.
Promise me that.

184
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:52,811
I dreamed of being a great musician.

185
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:55,851
I let myself get sidetracked.

186
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:59,541
If you were looking for something
to happen, that was it.

187
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:02,041
That was life. You lived it.

188
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,641
Job imagined he might
build his nest on high.

189
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:27,051
That the integrity of his behavior
would protect him against misfortune.

190
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:30,441
And his friends thought,
mistakenly, that the Lord could only

191
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:34,321
have punished him because,
secretly, he'd done something wrong.

192
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:37,221
But no.

193
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:39,951
Misfortune befalls the good as well.

194
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:43,531
We can't protect ourselves against it.

195
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:45,721
We can't protect our children.

196
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:48,771
We can't say to ourselves,
'Even if I'm not happy,

197
01:01:48,941 --> 01:01:51,801
I'm going to make sure they are. '

198
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,941
We run before the wind.
We think that it will carry us forever.

199
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:58,251
It will not.

200
01:01:58,411 --> 01:02:02,541
We vanish as a cloud.
We wither as the autumn grass.

201
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:05,281
And, like a tree, are rooted up.

202
01:02:08,021 --> 01:02:11,251
Is there some fraud in
the scheme of the universe?

203
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:13,691
Is there nothing which is deathless?

204
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:16,661
Nothing which does not pass away?

205
01:02:18,831 --> 01:02:21,201
We cannot stay where we are.

206
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,461
We must journey forward.

207
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:27,371
We must find that which is
greater than fortune or fate.

208
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:31,851
Nothing can bring us
peace but that.

209
01:02:33,281 --> 01:02:37,451
Is the body of the wise man
or the just, exempt from any pain?

210
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:43,281
From any disquietude? From the
deformity that might blight its beauty?

211
01:02:43,431 --> 01:02:47,051
From the weakness that
might destroy its health?

212
01:02:48,861 --> 01:02:54,361
Do you trust in God? Job,
too, was close to the Lord.

213
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:58,561
Are your friends and
children your security?

214
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:04,171
There is no hiding place in all the
world where trouble may not find you.

215
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:08,641
No one knows when sorrow might visit
his house, anymore than Job did.

216
01:03:10,551 --> 01:03:13,111
At the very moment everything
was taken away from Job,

217
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:16,661
he knew it was the Lord
who'd taken it away.

218
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:23,921
Returned from the passing shows of time,
he sought that which is eternal.

219
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:29,301
Does he alone see God's hand
who sees that he gives?

220
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:35,601
But does not also the one see God's
hand who sees that he takes away?

221
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:41,811
Or does he alone see God who
sees God turn his face towards him?

222
01:03:43,691 --> 01:03:48,521
Does not also he see God who
sees God turn his back?

223
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,161
That's a friend of mine.

224
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:52,021
He owns half the real estate in town.

225
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:55,161
Frank Johnson.

226
01:03:56,201 --> 01:03:58,191
He started out as a barber.

227
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:02,201
He built something big.

228
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:06,911
Now you'd think he's the fourth
person of the holy Trinity.

229
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:11,241
They never talk about their money.

230
01:04:14,781 --> 01:04:16,841
The wrong people go hungry.

231
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:19,781
Die.

232
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,791
The wrong people get loved.

233
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:28,891
The world lives by a trigger.

234
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:34,431
If you want to succeed,
you can't be too good.

235
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:25,851
Act like you're scared, act like you're
in trouble. You don't want to fight.

236
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:28,011
And the minute you see
him blink, crack him.

237
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:29,381
Ok?

238
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:32,391
You're going to cover, right?

239
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:42,161
It's the most important thing.

240
01:05:43,101 --> 01:05:45,401
Come on, Jack. Hit me.

241
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,271
Hit me, come on.

242
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:49,271
Here it is, hit me.

243
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:50,741
Come on, son.

244
01:05:50,911 --> 01:05:53,071
What are you doing?

245
01:06:00,021 --> 01:06:03,011
Left. Don't leave your tongue
out or you're going to lose it.

246
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:06,651
Left. Right.

247
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,091
Left. Harder.

248
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:11,821
Harder.

249
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:14,991
Come on son, hit.

250
01:06:15,141 --> 01:06:17,601
Give me something,
show me what you got.

251
01:06:19,171 --> 01:06:21,041
Come on. Go on.

252
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:28,851
One meal.

253
01:06:44,371 --> 01:06:46,061
Leave the table.

254
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:53,741
You too?

255
01:06:55,681 --> 01:06:57,771
- You're going to continue to defy me?
- No, sir.

256
01:06:57,951 --> 01:07:00,641
You're interrupting me, I wasn't done yet.

257
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:05,291
Am I finished?

258
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:09,826
- No?
- No.

259
01:07:09,861 --> 01:07:11,951
Thank you, your majesty.

260
01:08:08,481 --> 01:08:10,181
Makes up stories.

261
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:15,711
Or a chain of words.

262
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:27,091
He says, 'Don't put your elbows on the table. '

263
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:29,961
He does.

264
01:08:33,911 --> 01:08:36,171
Insults people.

265
01:08:37,651 --> 01:08:39,241
Doesn't care.

266
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,111
I remember when you were born.

267
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:48,241
They wouldn't let me come home.

268
01:08:50,331 --> 01:08:55,201
The Navy said an officer must be
present for the laying of the cue.

269
01:08:56,431 --> 01:08:58,101
I had to launch.

270
01:09:42,151 --> 01:09:43,941
The next word is volcano.

271
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:56,791
The next word is socket.

272
01:10:03,101 --> 01:10:06,801
Please pass your answers to each other.
We're going to grade each others' papers now.

273
01:10:13,111 --> 01:10:14,741
No interruptions, please.

274
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:19,951
Come on, get your pencil out.

275
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:41,131
Sweetheart!

276
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:44,931
Honey!

277
01:13:14,361 --> 01:13:15,951
Was he bad?

278
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:28,131
Will you die too?

279
01:13:30,511 --> 01:13:32,571
You're not that old yet, mom.

280
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:52,621
Where were you?

281
01:14:04,911 --> 01:14:06,601
You had a boy die.

282
01:14:14,221 --> 01:14:16,311
You let anything happen.

283
01:14:29,371 --> 01:14:32,201
I can't see!
I can't see!

284
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:39,341
Why should I be good?

285
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:44,381
If you aren't.

286
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:35,491
Thank you.

287
01:15:55,191 --> 01:15:56,951
Why's this bare here?

288
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:59,686
The grass wont grow under the tree.

289
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,681
It does at the Kimbles.
They have a yardener.

290
01:16:03,031 --> 01:16:04,521
They have money.

291
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:06,891
Of course he inherited it.

292
01:16:08,431 --> 01:16:12,801
I don't want to hear one more
word out of you, not until this is finished.

293
01:16:52,711 --> 01:16:54,441
You're cropping that too close.

294
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:57,011
You're going to have to keep that watered.

295
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:25,111
Toskanini.

296
01:17:25,811 --> 01:17:29,141
Once recorded a piece 65 times.
You know what he said when he finished?

297
01:17:30,211 --> 01:17:32,111
It could be better.

298
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,621
Think about it.

299
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:41,081
27 patents, your father has.

300
01:17:42,461 --> 01:17:45,051
It means ownership, ownership of ideas.

301
01:17:46,601 --> 01:17:50,501
You gotta sew them up.
Get them by the nuts, if you pardon my French.

302
01:17:52,571 --> 01:17:54,161
Be rich.

303
01:17:56,611 --> 01:17:58,841
You make yourself what you are.

304
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:04,511
You have control of your own destiny.

305
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:10,011
Can't say I can't.

306
01:18:11,591 --> 01:18:13,491
You see I'm having trouble.

307
01:18:14,861 --> 01:18:19,421
I'm not done yet. Can't say I can't.

308
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:56,761
Why's he hurt us?

309
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,131
Our father?

310
01:19:07,141 --> 01:19:10,671
Come on Vince! Get it, get it!

311
01:19:24,731 --> 01:19:26,631
Give your father a kiss.

312
01:20:06,371 --> 01:20:09,311
Lies.

313
01:20:11,281 --> 01:20:12,971
Will you do something for me?

314
01:20:13,411 --> 01:20:14,471
Do you promise you'll do it?

315
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:18,251
Without having to ask what it is? Just have the
confidence in what your father asks of you is right?

316
01:20:18,581 --> 01:20:19,981
Yes sir.

317
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:24,211
In the next half hour, will you not speak
unless you have something important to say?

318
01:20:30,891 --> 01:20:32,861
What did you do today, my fine feathered friend?

319
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,061
Sit on the front of your chair.

320
01:20:37,641 --> 01:20:40,801
It's better for your posture.
I read that in the paper.

321
01:20:44,681 --> 01:20:47,041
Did you actually buy this from Mr. Ledbetter?

322
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:50,381
Don't explain, just nod, yes or no?

323
01:20:56,591 --> 01:20:58,611
Be quiet.

324
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,991
What did you say?

325
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:06,521
Please.

326
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:08,261
Leave him alone.

327
01:21:12,141 --> 01:21:13,501
Leave him alone!

328
01:21:17,941 --> 01:21:19,811
Come here! Come here!

329
01:21:24,651 --> 01:21:26,051
Get up there!

330
01:22:22,811 --> 01:22:24,601
You turn my own kids against me.

331
01:22:26,281 --> 01:22:28,301
You undermine everything I do.

332
01:22:37,891 --> 01:22:39,651
How do you like it?

333
01:22:41,491 --> 01:22:42,621
Stop it!

334
01:22:43,661 --> 01:22:50,091
Stop.

335
01:23:01,211 --> 01:23:02,581
Stop.

336
01:25:00,831 --> 01:25:04,231
Where's dad?
He's gone on a trip.

337
01:25:47,281 --> 01:25:49,841
Get her! Get her!

338
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:51,911
Help each other.

339
01:25:54,181 --> 01:25:56,811
Do not slam that screen door!

340
01:25:57,891 --> 01:25:59,821
Love everyone.

341
01:26:02,631 --> 01:26:04,181
Every leaf.

342
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:08,121
Every ray of light.

343
01:26:15,871 --> 01:26:18,471
Our gift.

344
01:26:57,751 --> 01:26:58,981
Shut up!

345
01:27:56,611 --> 01:27:58,801
Watch out! Watch out! Go, go!

346
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:19,451
I say let's bust them.

347
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:33,671
Yea!

348
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:45,151
Yea!

349
01:28:45,961 --> 01:28:48,081
Found a frog!

350
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:50,261
Lets go set it off in a sky rocket!

351
01:28:50,631 --> 01:28:52,091
He's getting away!

352
01:28:54,461 --> 01:28:55,951
Get back! Get back!

353
01:29:03,241 --> 01:29:04,941
Did it go to the moon?

354
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:12,611
Where is he?
There he is.

355
01:29:13,881 --> 01:29:15,651
It was an experiment!

356
01:29:19,661 --> 01:29:20,881
Why?

357
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:24,851
Never do it again.

358
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:27,391
Promise?

359
01:29:30,401 --> 01:29:32,431
You want to tell dad?

360
01:29:33,571 --> 01:29:36,901
They're just trying to scare you.

361
01:29:38,911 --> 01:29:40,601
Keep your ear there.

362
01:29:45,181 --> 01:29:47,081
Things she got to learn.

363
01:29:50,591 --> 01:29:53,611
I gotta know stuff too.

364
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:14,581
They say you can't try stuff? They do.

365
01:30:19,151 --> 01:30:21,141
What do you need be afraid of?

366
01:30:24,351 --> 01:30:27,981
You're afraid. I see it.

367
01:30:28,761 --> 01:30:30,781
Right here! Right here!

368
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,051
I can't talk to you.

369
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:08,961
Don't look at me.

370
01:36:57,451 --> 01:36:59,541
What have I started?

371
01:37:03,491 --> 01:37:06,941
What have I done?

372
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:36,881
Stick it in there.

373
01:38:16,331 --> 01:38:17,921
I trust you.

374
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:37,581
You tired?
No. I never get tired.

375
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:41,381
You did this morning.
No, I was just pretending.

376
01:38:41,951 --> 01:38:43,851
You calling me a liar?
No.

377
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:48,051
I don't want to fight.
Afraid to?

378
01:38:48,621 --> 01:38:50,461
No, I just don't want to.

379
01:38:51,891 --> 01:38:55,391
If I was to say you're scared,
would you call me a liar?

380
01:38:55,426 --> 01:38:56,391
No.

381
01:38:57,201 --> 01:39:00,231
Then you're scared, aren't you?

382
01:39:10,511 --> 01:39:11,951
Quit it.

383
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:01,531
Come here!

384
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,700
NO!

385
01:40:09,071 --> 01:40:11,011
I don't want to do
anything you tell me to.

386
01:40:12,411 --> 01:40:14,571
I want to do what I want.

387
01:40:18,711 --> 01:40:21,241
What do you know?
You let him run all over you.

388
01:41:11,871 --> 01:41:14,001
How do I get back?

389
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:21,341
Where they are.

390
01:41:55,951 --> 01:41:58,001
This one is heavy,
you're going to need two hands.

391
01:42:08,391 --> 01:42:11,381
Careful now, you know what that is?
- Chinese?

392
01:42:12,131 --> 01:42:14,121
That's Chinese, that's very good, yes it is.

393
01:42:15,531 --> 01:42:18,471
Your father went all around the world.
All the way to China.

394
01:42:19,301 --> 01:42:22,601
That's Pan Am Airlines,
that's what your father flew on.

395
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:26,481
The entire bathroom was stainless steel.
Even the wash basin.

396
01:42:26,841 --> 01:42:29,071
I feel confident the
deal is going through.

397
01:42:29,581 --> 01:42:31,941
Nothing, forget it. I'll tell Molly to go to hell.

398
01:42:32,181 --> 01:42:34,781
That's from Germany.

399
01:42:35,081 --> 01:42:36,241
See that?

400
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:41,251
Put that down, son.

401
01:42:41,661 --> 01:42:42,921
Can Taylor come over?

402
01:42:43,591 --> 01:42:45,361
Was your family not good enough for you?

403
01:42:52,741 --> 01:42:55,641
It's not going to take
as long as last time?

404
01:42:56,111 --> 01:42:57,771
Al dente.

405
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:03,571
It's a subjective point,
you know the difference?

406
01:43:03,881 --> 01:43:06,711
Subjective means it comes from your mind.
It can't be proven by other people.

407
01:43:15,061 --> 01:43:18,031
It's good to see you again. Let's go boys.

408
01:43:22,301 --> 01:43:23,961
There are things you can't do.

409
01:43:24,301 --> 01:43:26,291
But there are things I can't do either.

410
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:30,071
You're not to call me dad,
you will call me father.

411
01:43:30,411 --> 01:43:31,671
- But...
Do not interrupt!

412
01:43:32,041 --> 01:43:33,871
- But you did...
Don't interrupt!

413
01:43:39,621 --> 01:43:40,841
It's your house.

414
01:43:41,221 --> 01:43:43,621
You can kick me out
whenever you want to.

415
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:51,321
You'd like to kill me.

416
01:44:10,311 --> 01:44:11,641
Dad.

417
01:44:16,591 --> 01:44:19,181
Why was he born?

418
01:45:43,971 --> 01:45:45,601
Please God, kill him.

419
01:45:50,751 --> 01:45:52,151
Let him die.

420
01:45:57,321 --> 01:45:59,251
Get him out of here.

421
01:46:20,211 --> 01:46:22,941
She only loves me!

422
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:40,900
Defend, oh Lord, this thy child with thy heavenly grace.
That he may continue thine forever.

423
01:46:41,631 --> 01:46:46,215
And daily increase in thy Holy Spirit more and more.

424
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:50,800
Until he come unto thy everlasting kingdom.
Amen.

425
01:47:32,181 --> 01:47:34,241
See something...

426
01:48:24,771 --> 01:48:26,201
Put your finger over it.

427
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:29,831
There.

428
01:48:31,341 --> 01:48:32,971
Come on.

429
01:49:30,871 --> 01:49:33,391
What I want to do I can't do.

430
01:49:38,971 --> 01:49:41,471
I do what I hate.

431
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:43,961
You can hit me if you want.

432
01:51:02,221 --> 01:51:03,421
I'm sorry.

433
01:51:06,761 --> 01:51:08,791
You're my brother.

434
01:51:52,981 --> 01:51:55,211
What was it you showed me?

435
01:52:03,691 --> 01:52:06,951
I didn't know how to name you sin.

436
01:52:11,561 --> 01:52:14,461
But I'll say it was you.

437
01:52:19,431 --> 01:52:22,231
Always you were calling me.

438
01:54:10,951 --> 01:54:14,041
I wanted to be loved cause I was great.

439
01:54:16,921 --> 01:54:18,351
A big man.

440
01:54:20,491 --> 01:54:22,681
I am nothing.

441
01:54:27,101 --> 01:54:29,861
Look, the glory around us.

442
01:54:33,271 --> 01:54:35,461
Trees and birds.

443
01:54:38,771 --> 01:54:41,711
I lived in shame.

444
01:54:44,281 --> 01:54:47,011
I dishonored it all and
didn't notice the glory.

445
01:54:53,761 --> 01:54:55,591
A foolish man.

446
01:55:00,731 --> 01:55:02,251
They're closing the plant.

447
01:55:06,071 --> 01:55:07,931
They gave me a choice.

448
01:55:11,471 --> 01:55:12,801
No job.

449
01:55:15,941 --> 01:55:19,281
Or transfer to a job nobody wants.

450
01:55:28,521 --> 01:55:29,791
Father.

451
01:55:32,831 --> 01:55:34,891
I never missed a day of work.

452
01:55:35,731 --> 01:55:37,601
Mother.

453
01:55:38,201 --> 01:55:40,631
Tithe every Sunday.

454
01:55:44,071 --> 01:55:47,341
Always you wrestle inside me.

455
01:55:51,851 --> 01:55:53,871
Always you will.

456
01:55:55,221 --> 01:55:57,581
You know Jack, all I ever wanted for you was...

457
01:55:59,621 --> 01:56:04,351
Make you strong and,
grow up and be your own boss.

458
01:56:08,331 --> 01:56:10,061
Maybe I've been tough on you.

459
01:56:12,531 --> 01:56:14,001
I'm not proud of that.

460
01:56:15,971 --> 01:56:18,371
I'm as bad as you are.

461
01:56:21,781 --> 01:56:23,771
I'm more like you than her.

462
01:56:32,651 --> 01:56:36,861
It was about all I've done in life,
otherwise I've drawn a zilch.

463
01:56:44,631 --> 01:56:47,700
You're all I have,
you're all I want to have.

464
01:56:55,111 --> 01:56:56,371
My sweet boy.

465
01:59:03,071 --> 01:59:05,471
Are you just going to stand
there like a bump on a lawn?

466
02:00:17,951 --> 02:00:20,281
The only way to be happy is to love.

467
02:00:24,951 --> 02:00:26,751
Unless you love,

468
02:00:28,861 --> 02:00:31,051
your life will flash by.

469
02:00:42,041 --> 02:00:43,661
Do good to them.

470
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:50,041
Wonder.

471
02:00:54,781 --> 02:00:56,271
Hope.

472
02:01:48,671 --> 02:01:50,141
Brother.

473
02:02:39,621 --> 02:02:42,281
Keep us.

474
02:02:50,571 --> 02:02:52,691
Guide us.

475
02:03:01,841 --> 02:03:04,001
To the end of time.

476
02:03:46,391 --> 02:03:48,221
Follow me.

477
02:10:53,151 --> 02:10:55,051
I give him to you.

478
02:11:00,291 --> 02:11:01,951
I give you my son.
