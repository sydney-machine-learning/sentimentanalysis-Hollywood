1
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:23,985
Shh!

2
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:27,521
Hey!

3
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,335
Let's give you a few
friends to play with.

4
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:55,383
Sorry.

5
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,418
Okay, I'm set.
How's things going down below?

6
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,085
How do you think?
I'm in a sewer.

7
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:47,685
I'm in position.

8
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,020
Move to phase 2.

9
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:45,376
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

10
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,261
What's wrong?
What's happening, Benji?

11
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:49,013
Oh, God. He's not going
to the extraction point.

12
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,498
Stay focused.
He knows where he's going.

13
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,776
No, I'm not. I won't.
I will not open that door.

14
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:05,112
Please go to the extraction point, Ethan.
I know.

15
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,099
I know what this means,
but I can't. I'm not authorized...

16
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,319
Go to the extraction
point, Ethan.

17
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:13,404
Go to the
extraction point!

18
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:15,155
Oh, you're just
going to wait.

19
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,391
We're going to wait.
Great. I can wait.

20
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:29,470
Okay, fine. Fine! Fine!

21
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:30,788
There.

22
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,657
We'll just screw the whole thing up on purpose.

23
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:42,299
Uh, Jane? We're going
to have a slight delay.

24
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:03,104
Why do you
want to go in there?

25
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:26,510
I don't know what he's doing,
and for some reason, I'm helping him.

26
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:28,595
As long as he's where he
should be when the song ends.

27
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:35,052
Uh, we have a passenger.

28
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,980
Sergei!

29
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,025
Open all of them!

30
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,302
Whoa!

31
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,194
Agent Hunt?

32
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,262
And you are?

33
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:26,197
Agent Carter.

34
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:28,015
Okay.

35
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:30,784
Who's your pal?

36
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,035
I'll tell you
on the way!

37
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,841
Light the fuse.

38
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,881
I don't mean to bring up
the elephant in the room,

39
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:43,801
but what's with the big,
hairy Russian?

40
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,154
Who, Bogdan? He fed me intel.
If I left him there, they would've killed him.

41
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:48,555
So we're gonna
give him his freedom.

42
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:49,723
Did you call in
the sweepers?

43
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,957
On their way.

44
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:52,576
Good, good.

45
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:57,047
Uh, Benji,
how is it you're here?

46
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,066
Oh, I passed
the field exam.

47
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:00,951
Crazy, right?

48
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,069
Yeah. Crazy.

49
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:04,855
DNA test.
It's me.

50
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,623
It's procedure.
I'm just confirming it's you.

51
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:08,675
You're very thorough.
Sergei?

52
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,210
Are you not Russian?

53
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:14,298
Sweepers approaching!
Brooms are out!

54
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,966
Roger that.
Sergei.

55
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,303
Are you not Sergei?

56
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:25,425
You'll be fine.

57
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,894
Bogdan.

58
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,528
I always take care
of my friends.

59
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:30,297
My friend.

60
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:38,338
Messy bringing him along.

61
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:39,773
I thought it went
rather well.

62
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,842
Mind telling me what you were
doing in a Russian prison?

63
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,727
Mind telling me
why you broke me out?

64
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,147
This wasn't
a rescue mission?

65
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:48,782
Uh, let me
put it this way.

66
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,518
If the Secretary
wanted me out of there,

67
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,788
it must be
pretty bad out here.

68
00:12:57,925 --> 00:12:59,560
We were after a file.

69
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:01,528
We lost it.

70
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:04,297
"We"? Who lost it? You?

71
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,155
Agent Hanaway.

72
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:12,706
Where's Hanaway?

73
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:24,985
It was a letter drop.

74
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:27,220
Classified file.

75
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:29,373
It should have been
a simple intercept.

76
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,683
We knew which train
the courier was on.

77
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,618
Uh, ETA, two minutes
on the courier.

78
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,153
But there was
one thing we didn't know.

79
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:45,689
Bobcat, your train's
six minutes out.

80
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:46,707
Who the courier was.

81
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:02,872
It's now or never, Bobcat.

82
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,376
The courier delivering the file,
what's his name?

83
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:08,045
Go ahead. Shoot.

84
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,980
We are out of time.

85
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:19,406
I need a name, folks.
I can't track all these people at once.

86
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:24,144
Marek. Stefanski.
For the love of God!

87
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:25,312
You got it?

88
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,331
Marek Stefanski.

89
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:30,918
Searching.

90
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,966
I'll take it from here.

91
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:52,355
Ow! Ow!

92
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,628
Hey, you all right,
buddy?

93
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,863
Hanaway dropped the mark and grabbed his bag.

94
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:03,750
Sit down.
Catch your breath.

95
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:07,420
He had the file in his hands.
Easy in, easy out.

96
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:08,655
File secured.

97
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:13,076
But we weren't
the only ones after it.

98
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:16,046
Bobcat, someone else
has crashed this party.

99
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:19,249
I'm not alone.

100
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,384
Local police?

101
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,654
No. Armed hostiles.

102
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:34,398
Hang tight, I'm coming!
Outrigger, back him up.

103
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,782
Negative, Outrigger.

104
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,987
Rendezvous southwest corner,
60 seconds.

105
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:43,507
Hanaway's lens cam drew a
facial match and triggered a warning.

106
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:47,895
But it was too late.

107
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,186
No!

108
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,459
You're going to be okay.

109
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:07,865
You're so beautiful.

110
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:13,303
I'm sorry, I...
I should have told you.

111
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,142
It was my op.

112
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,413
I put him in the field.

113
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,683
And she left him just alive enough for me to see him die.

114
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:45,335
I'm sorry.

115
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,190
You know her?

116
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:52,826
That's Sabine Moreau.
Contract killer.

117
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:55,529
Works for diamonds.

118
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:58,197
What was in the file?

119
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,291
Russian nuclear
launch codes.

120
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:19,870
IMF's been looking for an emerging extremist,
code name, Cobalt.

121
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,073
He's determined to detonate a
nuclear weapon however he can.

122
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,341
We know Moreau's
worked for him before.

123
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:27,578
What else does
IMF know about him?

124
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,447
As much as you do now.

125
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:32,449
But if Moreau has
nuclear launch codes,

126
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:34,918
you can bet Cobalt's gone
from a person of interest

127
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:36,586
to enemy number one.

128
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:38,438
We're here.

129
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,781
Agent confirmed.

130
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:06,399
Why was he in prison?

131
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:11,270
He disappeared after he and his wife...
You know.

132
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:15,375
I thought he'd just been
transferred. Put on leave.

133
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:19,746
There were rumors, though.
Talk of an unsanctioned hit.

134
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:21,247
Welcome back, Mr. Hunt.

135
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:24,584
In your absence,
IMF has learned that Cobalt is or was

136
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:27,520
a level-1 nuclear strategist
for Russian intelligence.

137
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:30,774
Therefore, the only way to uncover his actual identity

138
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:33,693
is to infiltrate
the Kremlin itself.

139
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,429
In order to get past
their checkpoints,

140
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:38,432
you'll be impersonating
General Anatoly Fedorov.

141
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:40,466
We believe Cobalt
will do everything he can

142
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:42,536
to destroy any record
of his identity.

143
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:44,905
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

144
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:47,924
is to penetrate the highly-secured
archive inside the Kremlin

145
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:50,843
and retrieve Cobalt's file
before he can destroy it.

146
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:54,681
New intel suggests Cobalt is already en route,
leaving you...

147
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:57,334
...4 hours 52 minutes...

148
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:58,868
...to infiltrate.

149
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:01,471
To save time, we've chosen
your team for you.

150
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:03,106
Agents Carter and Dunn.

151
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:07,644
As always,
should you or any member

152
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:10,013
of your team
be caught or killed,

153
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,949
the Secretary will disavow any
knowledge of your actions.

154
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:15,519
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.

155
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:16,987
Good luck, Ethan.

156
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:41,978
What do you got?

157
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,652
We're going
into the Kremlin.

158
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:52,705
I thought you said
"The Kremlin."

159
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,609
I thought you said
"The Kremlin."

160
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:00,313
Okay.

161
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:39,736
This is very exciting.

162
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:42,972
Being out in the field.

163
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,841
With you, you know.

164
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:47,210
It's a bit of
a dream for me.

165
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:53,483
Love your disguise, by the way.
You look just like him.

166
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:57,487
It's a shame we're not wearing masks.
You know, like, full masks.

167
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,724
Everybody gets to
wear a mask but Benji.

168
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:02,975
Sorry.

169
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:04,711
I'm tense. I babble
when I'm nervous.

170
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,747
I'm doing it again.
Shut up, Benji.

171
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:25,065
Okay, seven security guards.
X-ray machines. Cameras. Metal detectors.

172
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:27,434
Just what we expected.
We can do this.

173
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:35,608
Releasing in
three, two, one.

174
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:45,451
Game face,
game face. Kremlin game face.

175
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:49,021
Uh...

176
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,336
I think
that went quite well.

177
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:37,023
It's going to work.

178
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:41,778
I'm sorry, by the way.
About you and Julia.

179
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,381
You know,
not working out.

180
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:48,885
I wanted to say something
before you went away, but...

181
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:50,319
I liked her, you know.

182
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:53,122
He's off the phone now.

183
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,741
It's empty.

184
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,277
The nest is empty.

185
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,860
Check in,
Team Leader.

186
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:52,011
Over.

187
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:54,647
Repeat. Check in,
Team Leader.

188
00:28:54,815 --> 00:28:56,616
Have you made it
to the Archive Room?

189
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:04,557
Someone is piggybacking our frequency.

190
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:05,775
Team Leader,

191
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:09,579
awaiting your go-sign.
Standing by to detonate.

192
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,713
Abort.

193
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,069
Rendezvous nine-two.

194
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,982
Our media is no more
truthful than yours,

195
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,853
American.

196
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,990
But we both know that the real cause of the explosion

197
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:42,275
was you.

198
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:49,749
Awaiting your go-sign, Team Leader.

199
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,834
Standing by to detonate.

200
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,470
The worst part for you,

201
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:57,156
"Team Leader,"

202
00:32:57,223 --> 00:33:00,876
is I am the man assigned
to make you suffer for it.

203
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:03,395
For what you
did to my country.

204
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,660
Not a good idea.

205
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:45,731
It seemed like one...
A minute ago.

206
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:03,142
Consolidated Insurance.

207
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:04,509
How may I help you?

208
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:08,547
SAT 20. Agent 82-Delta-Echo
requesting immediate evac.

209
00:36:08,614 --> 00:36:10,916
Rendezvous Alpha 113.

210
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:14,053
Confirmed. Alpha 113.

211
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,577
Details surrounding

212
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:40,146
the intricate system
of gas lines

213
00:36:40,213 --> 00:36:42,932
that run beneath the square
are still forthcoming,

214
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:45,951
but the majority of those lines
date back to the Soviet era

215
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:48,287
and have not been updated
in at least...

216
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:02,734
We should leave town
for a couple of days.

217
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:05,337
Alex, you, me.
Vacations.

218
00:37:06,173 --> 00:37:07,657
Now?
Tonight.

219
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:11,827
Just...

220
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:13,762
Just the three of us.

221
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,516
...may not have been an accident,
but a targeted attack.

222
00:37:18,785 --> 00:37:20,252
Preliminary numbers
are just starting...

223
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,720
Where will we go?

224
00:37:21,788 --> 00:37:24,022
...to come in regarding
those wounded in the blast.

225
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,391
We can confirm
that 11 tourists...

226
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:27,659
Leonid?

227
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:29,228
...their nationalities
still unconfirmed,

228
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:32,864
have been transported to area hospitals for treatment.

229
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,933
While Russian
officials continue to blame

230
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:37,336
a gas-main break,
experts are citing

231
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:40,706
the shape of the blast area
and the size of the debris field

232
00:37:40,773 --> 00:37:43,576
as more consistent with that of a set explosive,

233
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:45,644
leading to speculation
that this may have been

234
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:47,879
an undeclared
act of aggression.

235
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:51,634
Although the Defense Ministry is
maintaining that this is strictly an accident...

236
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,403
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

237
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,306
We're leaving now.

238
00:37:58,525 --> 00:37:59,791
Anya!

239
00:38:01,794 --> 00:38:02,828
Anya!

240
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:16,625
We have work to do.

241
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,723
Mr. Secretary.

242
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:53,245
I wasn't aware
you were in Russia.

243
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:57,099
I'm not. Not since a bomb
blew up the Kremlin.

244
00:39:01,454 --> 00:39:04,106
Yesterday I flew in to accept the Order of Friendship

245
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:05,841
from the Russian
Prime Minister.

246
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:08,461
Now I'm headed
back to Washington

247
00:39:08,528 --> 00:39:11,196
to hand the President
my resignation.

248
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:16,585
My Chief Analyst,
William Brandt.

249
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:19,471
Do you have a pen?

250
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:20,639
Pardon me?
A pen.

251
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,159
Yeah.

252
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:27,229
Ethan, what happened
in the Kremlin?

253
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:29,565
Chief Analyst,
you say?

254
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,416
If you're implying that
I made a bad call...

255
00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:32,618
European male.

256
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:36,121
Fifties. About six-foot,
180 pounds. Blue eyes.

257
00:39:36,189 --> 00:39:37,623
Who is he?

258
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:42,078
A crude drawing,
but by your description,

259
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:43,545
that could be
Kurt Hendricks.

260
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:47,382
190 IQ. Served in
Swedish Special Forces.

261
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:50,219
Professor of physics,
Stockholm University.

262
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,187
Specialist in
nuclear endgame theory.

263
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:53,772
Asked to resign...

264
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,042
Well, because he's crazy.

265
00:39:58,044 --> 00:39:59,278
Cobalt.

266
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:04,349
You have to alert the Kremlin
that one of their strategists

267
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,134
has a nuclear
launch device

268
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:09,087
and one of his operatives
has the codes to activate it.

269
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,389
And what makes
you say that?

270
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:13,491
I saw him

271
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:16,094
leaving the executive
armory, bag in hand.

272
00:40:16,162 --> 00:40:18,463
He set off that explosion
to cover his tracks.

273
00:40:18,531 --> 00:40:20,665
It could be weeks before the Russians know it's missing.

274
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:21,867
Unless we tell them.

275
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:23,535
They won't listen to us.

276
00:40:23,602 --> 00:40:28,240
As far as the Russians are concerned,
we just bombed the Kremlin.

277
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,592
The tension between the United States and Russia

278
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,978
hasn't been this high since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

279
00:40:34,046 --> 00:40:38,099
And the blame,
right or wrong, points to IMF.

280
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:47,142
The President has initiated Ghost Protocol.

281
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,512
The entire IMF
has been disavowed.

282
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:55,283
So what happens now?

283
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:58,687
Now, I've been ordered to take you back to Washington,

284
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:02,091
where the DOD will label you as a rogue extremist

285
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:04,693
and hang the Kremlin bombing
on you and your team.

286
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:07,112
Unless,

287
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:09,464
you were to escape

288
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:12,450
somewhere between
here and the airport,

289
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:16,288
having assaulted
Mr. Brandt and me.

290
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:17,522
Sir?

291
00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:19,808
You would then

292
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:21,644
illegally scrounge whatever material you could

293
00:41:21,711 --> 00:41:24,280
from a backup supply cache
that I've overlooked.

294
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:27,683
The same cache where your team
are waiting for further orders.

295
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,751
Sir, you may
want to...

296
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:33,672
You will then disappear,
and this conversation never having taken place,

297
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,542
your intentions
would be unclear.

298
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,278
But if any one of your
team is caught or killed,

299
00:41:40,346 --> 00:41:42,514
they will be
branded terrorists,

300
00:41:42,582 --> 00:41:46,218
out to incite
global nuclear war.

301
00:41:53,225 --> 00:41:54,526
Your mission,

302
00:41:55,494 --> 00:41:57,629
should you
choose to accept it.

303
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:04,619
Ethan,
you were my best man.

304
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:07,806
And I'm sorry
it's come to this,

305
00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:10,092
after all the sacrifices
you made.

306
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:14,797
If we don't meet again,
I just want you to know,

307
00:42:15,815 --> 00:42:17,449
I've always considered
you a friend.

308
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,336
Stay down!
Drive, drive, drive!

309
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:50,732
You okay?
Yeah.

310
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,535
Take a deep breath.
Stay with me.

311
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:54,869
Ready?
Yeah.

312
00:43:19,478 --> 00:43:20,779
What do we do?

313
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:23,381
Wait here.

314
00:43:25,651 --> 00:43:27,753
Where else am I going to go?

315
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:44,386
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

316
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,952
Why would that work?

317
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:53,788
Why would what work?

318
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:56,025
The flare on the body,
why would that work?

319
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:57,259
It did work.

320
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,194
Yeah, I know, but...
Hey!

321
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:03,499
But why? I mean,
how did you know that would draw their fire?

322
00:45:03,566 --> 00:45:05,734
I didn't.
I played a hunch.

323
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:10,772
Okay. All right,
so what was your scenario?

324
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,608
Right, you... There's a guy
being shot at in the water.

325
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:17,879
All of a sudden,
decides to light up a flare and swim around?

326
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:20,582
I mean, what did you assume
they'd be thinking?

327
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,384
Thinking?
Yeah.

328
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:25,320
I didn't assume they were thinking.

329
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:27,423
I assumed they were shooting at anything that moved.

330
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,891
I just gave them a target.
Look, these...

331
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:32,744
These guys aren't
Rhodes Scholars, you know?

332
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,250
It's really happening,
isn't it?

333
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:41,419
Yeah.

334
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:42,954
Okay, you know
what that sound is?

335
00:45:43,022 --> 00:45:44,839
That's our ride
out of here!

336
00:45:44,907 --> 00:45:48,143
All right, it's a green car.
Number 47.

337
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:52,914
I see green!

338
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:54,549
Okay, let's do it.

339
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:56,168
Go, go, go, go.

340
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,905
All right, 47.

341
00:45:59,972 --> 00:46:01,172
I don't see it.

342
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,774
47.

343
00:46:02,842 --> 00:46:04,175
Oh, shit!

344
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,780
Whoa! Ho!

345
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,001
This is it.
The manifest.

346
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,653
Enter your code.

347
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:15,486
Pole!

348
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:17,355
Ah!

349
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:19,658
Jeez...

350
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,312
Press enter.

351
00:46:24,997 --> 00:46:26,548
Retinal scanner!

352
00:46:26,616 --> 00:46:27,465
Huh?

353
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:32,336
Retinal scan required.

354
00:46:32,404 --> 00:46:34,573
Watch out!

355
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,475
Retinal scan required.

356
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:38,142
Agent confirmed.

357
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:54,492
Ethan?
Jeez, I thought you were dead!

358
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,327
We are.
Who's this?

359
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:59,764
Agents Dunn and Carter.
William Brandt, Chief Analyst.

360
00:46:59,832 --> 00:47:01,165
Analyst?

361
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:07,456
Agent confirmed.

362
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:19,017
How will the world finally end?

363
00:47:19,084 --> 00:47:22,020
It is my job to predict
the unthinkable.

364
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:26,257
To treat the death
of billions as a game.

365
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,863
After 20 years of this,
I was numb.

366
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:35,817
Until a new question
crossed my mind.

367
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:38,787
What happens after
the end of the world?

368
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:41,022
Are you sure your
line is secure?

369
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,858
Every two or three million years...

370
00:47:42,925 --> 00:47:46,160
Are you certain
your line is secure?

371
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:50,198
...some natural catastrophe
devastates all life on Earth.

372
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:52,200
But life goes on.

373
00:47:52,268 --> 00:47:55,870
And what little remains
is made stronger.

374
00:47:55,938 --> 00:48:00,192
Put simply,
world destruction is an unpleasant,

375
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:02,460
but necessary
part of evolution.

376
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:07,415
What happens then,
I wondered,

377
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:10,001
when mankind faces the
next end of the world?

378
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:12,987
I don't care what you have to do to get him to Dubai.

379
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,557
I'll make it worth his while.
Just do it.

380
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:18,160
I looked
to Hiroshima, Nagasaki...

381
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:19,394
I'll be waiting
for your call.

382
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,996
...thriving cities
rebuilt from the ashes,

383
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,449
monuments to
the unimaginable,

384
00:48:24,517 --> 00:48:27,101
dedicated to
the concept of peace.

385
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:31,739
It occurred to me here that
nuclear war might have a place

386
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:33,191
in the natural order.

387
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:35,610
But only if it
could be controlled.

388
00:48:35,678 --> 00:48:39,981
Only if it touched
every living soul equally.

389
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:43,535
IMF now believes
this man,

390
00:48:43,602 --> 00:48:47,739
Kurt Hendricks, is the nuclear extremist,
code name Cobalt.

391
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:49,841
Today he was seen
leaving the Kremlin,

392
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:52,343
with what is likely
a nuclear launch device.

393
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:57,816
Two days ago,
Sabine Moreau killed one of our agents in Budapest

394
00:48:57,884 --> 00:49:00,585
and relieved him of Russian nuclear launch codes.

395
00:49:00,653 --> 00:49:05,123
Intel indicates she will check into
the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

396
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:08,894
Marius Wistrom is a known
operative of Cobalt.

397
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:11,112
Wistrom is currently
en route to Dubai.

398
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,933
For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

399
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:17,819
He's sending Wistrom
to buy them from Moreau.

400
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:20,305
The Secretary

401
00:49:21,874 --> 00:49:23,308
is dead.

402
00:49:28,413 --> 00:49:31,249
The President has invoked Ghost Protocol.

403
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:33,584
We're shut down.

404
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:37,655
No satellite, safe house, support,
or extraction.

405
00:49:37,723 --> 00:49:40,925
The four of us and the contents of this car

406
00:49:40,993 --> 00:49:43,661
are all that remain
of the IMF.

407
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:48,099
And as of this moment,
any action is unsanctioned. So if you want out,

408
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:49,500
speak now.

409
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:07,502
Our mission
is Hendricks.

410
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,504
We're all that stands
between him and his goal.

411
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:11,038
Nothing can be
left to chance.

412
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:13,057
Everyone connected
with this man

413
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:16,461
is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.

414
00:50:16,529 --> 00:50:17,796
No one can know
we're still on line.

415
00:50:17,863 --> 00:50:20,198
We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

416
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:22,116
So, what's the play?

417
00:50:22,184 --> 00:50:24,569
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.

418
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:26,805
Now we cannot let the launch codes leave the hotel,

419
00:50:26,872 --> 00:50:29,774
but we need Wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

420
00:50:29,842 --> 00:50:32,126
He'll only do that
if he has the codes.

421
00:50:32,194 --> 00:50:33,478
Or if he thinks
he has them.

422
00:50:33,546 --> 00:50:35,780
Our objective is to
intercept the sale,

423
00:50:35,848 --> 00:50:38,132
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

424
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,967
and follow Wistrom
to Hendricks.

425
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:43,738
Well, that's simple enough.
We snatch the codes, we gin up some fakes.

426
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:48,643
Jane, you double Moreau,
and sell the codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

427
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:51,980
And how do you propose we just
snatch the codes from Moreau?

428
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,315
We take her out.

429
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,252
Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

430
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,437
Discreetly?

431
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,956
Yeah.

432
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:05,427
Right, she's an asset. Right. I get it.
Sorry. Nothing left to chance.

433
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:07,995
He said... I'm spitballing.
It's not all gonna be gold.

434
00:51:08,063 --> 00:51:09,731
We don't touch Wistrom.
- All right.

435
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:10,999
Or Moreau.

436
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:16,253
She'll answer for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

437
00:51:16,321 --> 00:51:18,222
After we hit Hendricks.

438
00:51:24,113 --> 00:51:25,563
Only pack
what we need.

439
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:27,916
Yeah, absolutely.
Only pack what we... You never know.

440
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:58,963
So even if we can
double Wistrom and Moreau,

441
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:01,266
how do we keep them
in separate rooms

442
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:04,135
while having them think that
they're in the same room?

443
00:52:04,036 --> 00:52:06,120
We give
the hotel a facelift.

444
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:08,956
Wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

445
00:52:09,024 --> 00:52:11,459
but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.

446
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:13,260
Where I'll double Moreau.

447
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:14,663
Downstairs, Benji
will double Wistrom.

448
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:15,997
Masks!

449
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:17,866
And meet with
the real Moreau.

450
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:19,784
And, uh...

451
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:21,286
What am I doing?

452
00:52:21,737 --> 00:52:24,239
You? You're the helper!

453
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:29,010
Helper. That's great.

454
00:52:29,078 --> 00:52:34,282
Okay, so to the extent I understand
what you're talking about here...

455
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,751
The Burj Khalifa,
it's the tallest building in the world,

456
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:39,154
and you want to alter
its infrastructure

457
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:42,023
with the hopes of convincing
two people that they've

458
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:45,426
had a meeting,
which actually really never happened.

459
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,162
Right?

460
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:49,381
Uh...

461
00:52:49,448 --> 00:52:51,432
Oh!

462
00:52:55,888 --> 00:52:57,088
Camels.

463
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:46,587
ETA on dry cleaning.

464
00:53:46,655 --> 00:53:48,156
On my way up.

465
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,794
Okay, 34 minutes
to door knock.

466
00:53:57,383 --> 00:54:00,352
Wow, um...

467
00:54:00,419 --> 00:54:04,589
Okay, this is a slight wrinkle,
but nothing to worry about.

468
00:54:04,656 --> 00:54:07,892
We're just going to have to go into
the server room from the outside.

469
00:54:09,094 --> 00:54:10,778
What?

470
00:54:10,846 --> 00:54:14,148
Well, the firewalls on this
building's server are military grade.

471
00:54:14,216 --> 00:54:15,933
I mean, this
would be a cinch

472
00:54:16,001 --> 00:54:17,434
if I could call Youssef
back at headquarters,

473
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:19,503
but Youssef doesn't exist anymore,
and neither do we.

474
00:54:19,571 --> 00:54:22,223
I could hack it, but it would take too long.
Then hardwire in.

475
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:25,192
And there's four layers of next-gen
security between us and the server room.

476
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,695
There's no way we can get to it from inside.

477
00:54:27,796 --> 00:54:30,498
If we can't get to the server,
we don't control the elevators,

478
00:54:30,566 --> 00:54:32,316
we don't control
the security cameras.

479
00:54:32,384 --> 00:54:34,486
This operation is over
before it even begins.

480
00:54:34,553 --> 00:54:36,704
I'm telling you, we can
get to it from outside.

481
00:54:36,772 --> 00:54:37,621
"We"?

482
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:40,357
I'm...
I'm on the computer.

483
00:54:42,261 --> 00:54:43,995
I'm just, uh...

484
00:54:44,062 --> 00:54:45,397
The helper.

485
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:50,118
What floor is it on?

486
00:54:50,185 --> 00:54:51,802
Oh, 130.

487
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:54,054
130?

488
00:54:58,310 --> 00:54:59,627
Vent ducts.
Pressure sensitive.

489
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:00,545
Not enough time.

490
00:55:00,612 --> 00:55:02,079
Elevator shaft.
Infrared sensors.

491
00:55:02,147 --> 00:55:03,381
Not enough time.

492
00:55:06,985 --> 00:55:08,636
How am I supposed
to do this?

493
00:55:14,793 --> 00:55:16,144
God damn it!

494
00:55:19,915 --> 00:55:20,965
Oh, that's high.

495
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:30,725
Okay, now remember,
it's a rolling off motion that disengages the bond.

496
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:32,794
When the meter is blue,
that's full adhesion.

497
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,029
Easy way to remember,
blue is glue.

498
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:36,564
And when it's red?
Dead.

499
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:39,533
Here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

500
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:42,703
Both going back here.
One, two.

501
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:44,939
Okay, Ethan,
the hotel server is eleven stories up

502
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:46,641
and seven units over.

503
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:48,909
Okay? Comm check.

504
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:50,962
Yeah. Copy.

505
00:55:52,564 --> 00:55:53,731
So...

506
00:55:57,469 --> 00:56:00,271
It's 26 minutes
to door knock.

507
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,441
Yeah.

508
00:56:58,046 --> 00:57:00,481
25 minutes to door knock.

509
00:57:15,247 --> 00:57:16,847
What the hell is that?

510
00:57:31,963 --> 00:57:34,265
Yeah, what the hell is that?

511
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:37,468
It's a sandstorm.

512
00:57:39,588 --> 00:57:40,688
It's a long way off, Ethan.

513
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:42,139
Shouldn't be a problem.

514
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,678
24 minutes to door knock.

515
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:52,015
Where's Ethan?

516
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:56,270
You've got to be
kidding me.

517
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:49,173
23 minutes to door knock.

518
00:59:07,842 --> 00:59:09,193
I'm at server level.

519
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:33,301
22 minutes
to door knock.

520
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:37,205
The countdown
is not helping.

521
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:40,208
I'm just saying.

522
01:00:10,321 --> 01:00:11,472
I'm in.

523
01:00:11,539 --> 01:00:13,107
That's great, Ethan.
You're halfway home.

524
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:22,266
Located server.

525
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:30,658
Please tell me we're online.

526
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:32,376
All right, we're live.

527
01:00:32,444 --> 01:00:36,564
Okay, I now have control of the
elevators and the security cameras.

528
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:37,832
Time to redecorate.

529
01:00:37,899 --> 01:00:40,435
Okay, you drive.
And look out for Wistrom and Moreau.

530
01:00:55,467 --> 01:00:57,535
Moreau is at the elevators ahead of schedule.

531
01:00:58,570 --> 01:00:59,736
Go.

532
01:01:05,393 --> 01:01:07,028
We can't open
this door, can we?

533
01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:08,629
The door? No.

534
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:10,314
Ethan, you gotta
get down here now.

535
01:01:11,683 --> 01:01:13,584
Ethan!

536
01:01:13,652 --> 01:01:16,120
Is there a problem?
Ethan?

537
01:01:23,178 --> 01:01:24,345
We're not gonna make it.

538
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,479
We have to make it.

539
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:27,681
Where's Ethan?

540
01:01:50,288 --> 01:01:52,155
Your line's
not long enough!

541
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,841
No shit!

542
01:02:38,887 --> 01:02:40,654
Whoo!

543
01:02:40,722 --> 01:02:42,389
That was not easy,

544
01:02:42,457 --> 01:02:44,125
but I did it.

545
01:02:46,561 --> 01:02:47,928
What'd I miss?

546
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:58,539
The lens might be
a little uncomfortable.

547
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:00,140
It captures images
and transmits them

548
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:01,576
to the printer
in the briefcase.

549
01:03:02,577 --> 01:03:04,512
All right?
Mmm.

550
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:07,130
I can't see out of
one eye, but I'm fine.

551
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:08,999
Blink twice to activate the shutter.

552
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,869
Notice the numbers
are in order?

553
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:16,306
A perfect copy.

554
01:03:18,693 --> 01:03:20,260
But the numbers
are scrambled.

555
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:23,080
Masks?

556
01:03:23,148 --> 01:03:25,249
60 seconds. You sure
I shouldn't wear a mask?

557
01:03:25,316 --> 01:03:27,301
You know,
'cause I'm not exactly Omar Sharif.

558
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:29,537
I'll play it French.
This is your tracking device.

559
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,305
This is what you're tracking.
The paper clip?

560
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:33,140
No, it's the paper.

561
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:35,226
It's in the briefcase.
It's coated with isotopes which give off a unique...

562
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:37,979
It just means that you can track the
documents even if they switch briefcases.

563
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:39,029
Range?

564
01:03:39,097 --> 01:03:40,548
Not that good.
It's, like, half a mile.

565
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:42,216
Safest thing to do would be not
let Wistrom out of your sight.

566
01:03:42,283 --> 01:03:43,718
Is that Wistrom?

567
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:49,823
Who's that with him?

568
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:51,792
I don't know. We don't have an uplink,
so there's no facial recognition.

569
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,510
Who's that with him?

570
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,481
That's Leonid Lisenker.
Polish-born cryptographer.

571
01:03:57,549 --> 01:04:00,318
He redesigned Russia's nuclear
security after the Cold War.

572
01:04:00,485 --> 01:04:02,719
He's here to authenticate
the launch codes.

573
01:04:02,787 --> 01:04:04,638
Yes, he is. We are blown.
No, we're not blown.

574
01:04:04,706 --> 01:04:06,941
Well, we will be as soon as he
sees the counterfeit launch codes.

575
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,192
We're not blown.

576
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:09,893
He's in the elevator.

577
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:11,145
Delay them.

578
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,306
Benji, how long would it take
you to reprogram the case?

579
01:04:22,373 --> 01:04:24,592
A couple of seconds.
What for, though?

580
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,860
To make an exact copy
of the launch codes.

581
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:28,545
What?
You can't do that.

582
01:04:28,613 --> 01:04:30,114
Wistrom's on 22!
Slow him down.

583
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:31,415
I'll do what I can.

584
01:04:34,168 --> 01:04:35,853
Wait, wait.
Ethan, hang on now!

585
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,421
Hang on.
Just a second.

586
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:40,607
You're talking about handing over active
nuclear launch codes to Wistrom?

587
01:04:40,675 --> 01:04:42,009
Yes. Reprogram the case.

588
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:42,893
Listen... Stop!

589
01:04:42,961 --> 01:04:44,077
Just listen to
what you're saying.

590
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:45,929
You're fixating.
You're not thinking clearly.

591
01:04:45,997 --> 01:04:48,950
It's not gonna happen.
I won't let it!

592
01:04:49,034 --> 01:04:50,952
33 and climbing!

593
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:53,671
Brandt, use your head now.
The mission is not the codes, the mission is Hendricks.

594
01:04:53,738 --> 01:04:55,923
Then just let it play out.
Give him bad codes. Neutralize him.

595
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:57,425
You know
that won't do it.

596
01:04:57,492 --> 01:04:59,693
Failure to a terrorist is just a rehearsal for success.

597
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:01,312
41!

598
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:03,464
We lose Hendricks today,
he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.

599
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:04,632
He finds another way.

600
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,200
With no IMF to stop him.

601
01:05:06,268 --> 01:05:08,486
No. It's now or never.
Now, Brandt, give me the case.

602
01:05:08,553 --> 01:05:10,905
Nothing can be left to chance.
You said that.

603
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,923
You're the analyst.
Now, tell me there's not another way

604
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:14,191
for Hendricks
to get those codes.

605
01:05:14,259 --> 01:05:15,860
50!

606
01:05:15,927 --> 01:05:17,762
You tell me that this is his only avenue,
right here, right now, today.

607
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:20,214
You tell me that,
I'll walk away.

608
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:29,606
We go without.
Without masks?

609
01:05:29,674 --> 01:05:30,975
Jane needs to go.
Ethan!

610
01:05:31,043 --> 01:05:32,025
We have no choice.

611
01:05:32,093 --> 01:05:33,894
Ethan, you'd be walking in
on Moreau unarmed.

612
01:05:33,962 --> 01:05:35,095
Face-first. Literally.

613
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:36,297
How do we know
they've met?

614
01:05:36,364 --> 01:05:38,466
How do we know they haven't?
Doesn't matter!

615
01:05:39,584 --> 01:05:41,118
Damn it.

616
01:05:41,186 --> 01:05:42,686
We have no choice.

617
01:06:33,955 --> 01:06:35,289
Goggles.

618
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,226
What if they
have met?

619
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,630
Come in.

620
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,535
Which one of you is Wistrom?

621
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:23,170
Which one of you
is Wistrom?

622
01:07:26,024 --> 01:07:27,357
I am.

623
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,694
I admire your work.

624
01:07:46,127 --> 01:07:47,277
Sit.

625
01:07:56,603 --> 01:07:57,870
Where are my codes?

626
01:07:59,423 --> 01:08:01,156
Where are my diamonds?

627
01:08:02,075 --> 01:08:03,308
Close by.

628
01:08:04,243 --> 01:08:06,011
You have my payment?

629
01:08:05,962 --> 01:08:07,513
When I see the codes.

630
01:08:08,648 --> 01:08:11,083
Not to worry.
Come in!

631
01:08:11,151 --> 01:08:12,817
I thought
we could have tea.

632
01:08:15,288 --> 01:08:18,857
Mademoiselle. Messieurs.

633
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,062
No diamonds,
no codes.

634
01:08:23,129 --> 01:08:25,347
No codes, no diamonds.

635
01:08:29,302 --> 01:08:30,469
Kill this one.

636
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:32,621
We didn't come alone.

637
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:34,456
That hallway out there
is a kill-box.

638
01:08:34,524 --> 01:08:35,974
You know who
we work for.

639
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:38,610
We come back with the codes,
or we don't come back.

640
01:08:40,363 --> 01:08:42,063
How good is
your backup?

641
01:08:41,965 --> 01:08:43,349
The best.

642
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:45,233
Hmm.

643
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:49,955
I've killed the best.

644
01:08:50,023 --> 01:08:51,924
Do you care for some sugar?

645
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:57,879
Enough.
Let's get this done.

646
01:08:57,947 --> 01:09:00,949
You want payment,
I want guarantees.

647
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:02,501
When he's authenticated the codes,

648
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:04,970
I'll make the call
and you get your diamonds.

649
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:07,172
That or...

650
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,275
We all go home
in buckets.

651
01:09:10,193 --> 01:09:12,861
Nobody leaves
this hotel alive.

652
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,733
Get the papers.

653
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:33,582
Is there a problem?

654
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,584
It's locked.

655
01:09:39,589 --> 01:09:43,408
Ah, forgive me.
There must be a key.

656
01:09:44,578 --> 01:09:46,512
One moment, huh?

657
01:09:49,015 --> 01:09:50,483
Messieurs.

658
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:47,823
My mistake.
It is a combination, not a key.

659
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:50,558
You tell me the numbers.

660
01:10:56,282 --> 01:10:57,682
They're good.

661
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:58,533
Zero.

662
01:11:00,353 --> 01:11:01,536
Zero.

663
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:04,272
Zero.

664
01:11:21,308 --> 01:11:22,575
Come on, come on, come on.

665
01:12:05,952 --> 01:12:08,286
It was a pleasure
doing business with...

666
01:12:08,354 --> 01:12:10,973
Wistrom has the launch codes.
He's on the move.

667
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,726
Hey, I did as you asked.
I did. Now let my family go!

668
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:16,227
Release Leonid's family.

669
01:12:16,296 --> 01:12:17,596
Thank God.

670
01:12:17,664 --> 01:12:19,097
You can thank
him in person.

671
01:12:34,997 --> 01:12:37,532
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

672
01:12:53,983 --> 01:12:55,233
Moreau's on the move!

673
01:12:56,069 --> 01:12:57,419
I've got her.

674
01:12:58,754 --> 01:12:59,872
Jane?

675
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:01,106
She's an asset!

676
01:13:01,174 --> 01:13:02,540
I need her

677
01:13:02,608 --> 01:13:03,324
alive!

678
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:06,044
Acknowledge!

679
01:13:06,712 --> 01:13:07,896
Acknowledge!

680
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:22,878
Uh, Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator.
I can't see Leonid, though.

681
01:13:24,464 --> 01:13:27,866
Benji, slow him down.
Get me an elevator.

682
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:41,413
Find Leonid.

683
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:57,145
Benji, I've got a lock on Wistrom.
But I can't tell.

684
01:13:57,213 --> 01:13:58,897
Is he still
in the elevator?

685
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:01,366
Benji?

686
01:14:05,455 --> 01:14:06,238
Ethan. Over?

687
01:14:06,373 --> 01:14:07,372
Benji.

688
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,741
Benji, I lost...

689
01:14:08,808 --> 01:14:10,375
Ethan, can you hear me?

690
01:14:10,443 --> 01:14:11,860
Ethan, can you hear me? Over.

691
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:14,112
Jesus!

692
01:14:20,236 --> 01:14:21,469
Sit down!

693
01:14:23,406 --> 01:14:25,107
Watch her.
Why me?

694
01:14:25,175 --> 01:14:26,675
Because if I do,
I'll kill her.

695
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:59,741
Hold it, Team Leader.

696
01:14:59,808 --> 01:15:02,244
Did you really think I wouldn't catch up with you?

697
01:15:02,312 --> 01:15:04,312
You and I are not enemies.
It was a set-up...

698
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:07,182
We'll find out
your lies soon enough.

699
01:15:07,816 --> 01:15:08,800
Move it!

700
01:15:09,853 --> 01:15:11,770
I'm sorry about this.

701
01:15:34,327 --> 01:15:36,094
Leonid. Benji?

702
01:15:36,162 --> 01:15:37,796
Go for Benji.

703
01:15:37,864 --> 01:15:39,414
I've got Leonid by the elevators.
He's been shot.

704
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:40,298
What?

705
01:15:51,193 --> 01:15:53,945
Hey, hey. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

706
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:14,633
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

707
01:16:20,923 --> 01:16:22,740
Jane! No!

708
01:19:23,789 --> 01:19:25,424
Come on. Come on.

709
01:22:19,165 --> 01:22:20,565
Now, what happened
with Moreau, Jane?

710
01:22:20,632 --> 01:22:21,699
She couldn't help us
with Hendricks.

711
01:22:21,767 --> 01:22:23,334
So let's throw her
off the building!

712
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:24,402
I didn't throw her.

713
01:22:24,469 --> 01:22:25,503
Let's throw her
off the building!

714
01:22:25,571 --> 01:22:28,039
She was not
the mission, Jane!

715
01:22:28,106 --> 01:22:33,244
The mission was to track the file back to Hendricks,
who is in the wind

716
01:22:33,311 --> 01:22:35,313
with nuclear launch codes!

717
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:38,183
Maybe you didn't notice
the gun she had pointed at me.

718
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,484
Yeah, like you didn't
notice the open window,

719
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:42,420
or that we're about
a mile up in the air!

720
01:22:42,487 --> 01:22:44,155
It was an
instinctive move.

721
01:22:44,223 --> 01:22:45,256
It doesn't matter!

722
01:22:45,324 --> 01:22:47,158
We're talking
about a nuclear war.

723
01:22:47,226 --> 01:22:49,728
The asset is more
important than you.

724
01:22:49,795 --> 01:22:52,163
Where do you get off
telling me how well I executed?

725
01:22:52,231 --> 01:22:53,965
We inherited you.

726
01:22:54,033 --> 01:22:56,084
You're just
a bureaucrat!

727
01:22:56,151 --> 01:22:58,586
Better have good news for me.
Is he here?

728
01:22:58,653 --> 01:23:00,955
You think I need you to
tell me what the mission is?

729
01:23:01,023 --> 01:23:03,824
Yeah, I got it.
Dunhill lighter. I'll be there.

730
01:23:03,892 --> 01:23:05,593
And no one will be
following me.

731
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,695
Just make sure
no one's following you.

732
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:09,447
And how the hell did the Russians find us?

733
01:23:09,514 --> 01:23:11,315
What are you asking me for?
Because you're communications!

734
01:23:11,383 --> 01:23:13,017
You're in charge of
covering our tracks.

735
01:23:13,085 --> 01:23:15,920
You cannot afford to
make mistakes like that now, Benji.

736
01:23:15,988 --> 01:23:18,322
You're not a technician anymore.
You're a field agent.

737
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:20,959
And you're just
an "analyst."

738
01:23:21,026 --> 01:23:22,160
Right?

739
01:23:22,894 --> 01:23:24,195
Right?

740
01:23:25,381 --> 01:23:27,415
Who are you
really, Brandt?

741
01:23:29,084 --> 01:23:31,219
What are you asking?
What am I asking?

742
01:23:31,286 --> 01:23:32,937
Let me see if I can
put it another way.

743
01:23:40,112 --> 01:23:44,115
How does an agent with skills
like that end up an analyst?

744
01:23:52,258 --> 01:23:54,459
Well, we all
have our secrets.

745
01:23:55,962 --> 01:23:57,562
Don't we, Ethan?

746
01:24:02,517 --> 01:24:05,119
You tell me yours,
I'll tell you mine.

747
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,074
I have friends in the region.
Just sit tight.

748
01:24:27,142 --> 01:24:28,709
I'll send someone
to get you out of here.

749
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:29,944
What about Hendricks?
What's the plan?

750
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:33,113
The plan was for us
to stop him together.

751
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:35,349
Well,
what are you going to do?

752
01:24:35,417 --> 01:24:36,451
Change the plan.

753
01:24:36,518 --> 01:24:38,753
Wait.
That's it?

754
01:24:38,821 --> 01:24:41,740
What are you going to do,
go after him alone?

755
01:24:43,342 --> 01:24:46,444
Would you care to explain yourself,
Agent Brandt?

756
01:25:50,292 --> 01:25:53,361
I was on a protection
detail in Croatia.

757
01:25:53,428 --> 01:25:57,565
Shadowing the assets,
husband and wife.

758
01:25:57,633 --> 01:25:59,500
They were never supposed to know we were there.

759
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:02,303
Whole thing's routine,
it was a milk run.

760
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:07,542
Three days in

761
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:11,245
we caught wind that a Serbian
hit squad was after our couple.

762
01:26:11,313 --> 01:26:13,914
But my team had
it under control.

763
01:26:13,982 --> 01:26:16,484
We knew they
were coming.

764
01:26:16,552 --> 01:26:20,821
But I couldn't shake this feeling that
I should warn the couple somehow.

765
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:23,457
I wanted to find a way to let them know.

766
01:26:25,627 --> 01:26:28,563
But, you know,
orders are orders, so I didn't.

767
01:26:33,502 --> 01:26:37,905
One day,
the husband decides to leave the hotel and go for a run,

768
01:26:37,973 --> 01:26:43,478
so I follow him,
and I leave two men with the wife.

769
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:47,648
When I get back,
my guys are unconscious and the wife is gone.

770
01:26:49,585 --> 01:26:52,487
Local police found her body three days later.

771
01:26:53,555 --> 01:26:55,690
What was left
of her, anyway.

772
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:04,498
That was my last
day in the field.

773
01:27:04,566 --> 01:27:07,868
I couldn't face another life-or-death situation after that.

774
01:27:07,936 --> 01:27:10,304
So what happened
to the husband?

775
01:27:10,372 --> 01:27:11,639
I never saw him again.

776
01:27:13,425 --> 01:27:15,193
Until two days ago
in Moscow,

777
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:18,029
when the Secretary introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

778
01:27:21,733 --> 01:27:25,203
No, that's not what happened.
She left him.

779
01:27:25,271 --> 01:27:28,373
Yeah, I heard
that one, too, Benji.

780
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:32,777
But, unfortunately,
I was there.

781
01:27:32,844 --> 01:27:36,648
Just like I was there when the
Secretary got the phone call

782
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:41,052
that Ethan was in custody for killing
six Serbian nationals in cold blood.

783
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:42,302
An unsanctioned hit.

784
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:43,370
Yeah.

785
01:27:43,438 --> 01:27:45,405
Disavowed.

786
01:27:53,899 --> 01:27:55,299
The next thing I know,

787
01:27:56,067 --> 01:27:58,035
I'm on a plane to Dubai,

788
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:03,140
wondering the whole time,
do I tell him?

789
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:07,044
How do I tell him?

790
01:28:09,281 --> 01:28:11,081
That I'm responsible.

791
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:15,068
I could have warned him.

792
01:28:15,136 --> 01:28:16,938
I should have warned him.

793
01:28:19,374 --> 01:28:20,842
But I didn't.

794
01:28:22,578 --> 01:28:24,044
And she died.

795
01:28:30,502 --> 01:28:34,205
Sergei! Sergei,
my friend!

796
01:28:34,273 --> 01:28:37,308
I told you I would get him here.
Didn't I say?

797
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:38,710
How do I know it's him?

798
01:28:38,777 --> 01:28:42,546
Yes, it's him. You trust me,
I trust you. Right?

799
01:28:42,615 --> 01:28:44,082
This is the guy!

800
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:46,851
This is the guy,
the one I told you about.

801
01:28:46,919 --> 01:28:49,487
So we can take
these things off.

802
01:28:54,225 --> 01:28:57,261
Sorry. He's a great guy,
but he doesn't know you like I do.

803
01:28:57,212 --> 01:29:00,265
So, you work for
the American government.

804
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:03,167
And you're
an arms dealer.

805
01:29:03,235 --> 01:29:06,103
No, no, no.
Sergei. Sergei.

806
01:29:06,188 --> 01:29:10,457
He's "independent defense coordinator."
Right?

807
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:13,411
That you are.
Very classy job.

808
01:29:13,478 --> 01:29:14,545
Listen. He's a friend.

809
01:29:14,613 --> 01:29:16,447
Those diamonds
are for Bogdan.

810
01:29:16,515 --> 01:29:18,332
No, no. It's okay.
You can have them.

811
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,569
Whatever arrangements you made with
my cousin is between you and him.

812
01:29:21,636 --> 01:29:24,505
You want something
from me, you pay.

813
01:29:24,573 --> 01:29:29,493
You misunderstand.
I'm not buying. I'm selling.

814
01:29:29,561 --> 01:29:31,728
You're selling.

815
01:29:31,796 --> 01:29:33,197
Selling what?

816
01:29:33,265 --> 01:29:34,499
The future.

817
01:29:34,566 --> 01:29:37,368
Yeah, I got all I need,
thank you.

818
01:29:37,436 --> 01:29:39,753
Our countries
are on the brink of war.

819
01:29:39,722 --> 01:29:41,856
War is very good
for business.

820
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:43,457
Nuclear war?

821
01:29:53,652 --> 01:29:54,952
Go on.

822
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,787
I'm looking for a man
named Kurt Hendricks.

823
01:29:56,855 --> 01:29:58,489
You may know him
as Cobalt.

824
01:29:58,557 --> 01:30:01,325
In either case,
I think you know what he wants.

825
01:30:01,393 --> 01:30:04,228
I'll bet he even tried to buy it from you at some point.

826
01:30:05,464 --> 01:30:06,531
Go on.

827
01:30:06,598 --> 01:30:09,367
He has a case,
he has codes.

828
01:30:09,434 --> 01:30:12,736
But they're worthless
without a tactical satellite.

829
01:30:12,804 --> 01:30:15,739
I want to know
where he'd get it.

830
01:30:15,807 --> 01:30:19,544
A man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.

831
01:30:20,295 --> 01:30:22,263
And to your government,

832
01:30:22,331 --> 01:30:26,700
a potential terrorist
is a terrorist.

833
01:30:29,354 --> 01:30:30,354
If you help me,

834
01:30:31,706 --> 01:30:34,708
my friends
become your friends.

835
01:30:37,846 --> 01:30:39,013
Sorry.

836
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:41,983
I cannot help you.

837
01:30:47,472 --> 01:30:50,541
I certainly cannot tell you
that Russia quietly sold

838
01:30:50,609 --> 01:30:54,428
an obsolete tactical satellite to
a certain telecom in Mumbai.

839
01:30:56,265 --> 01:30:58,399
And whoever gave
them that idea?

840
01:30:58,467 --> 01:31:02,203
An enterprising third party.

841
01:31:02,271 --> 01:31:03,871
Working on commission.

842
01:31:03,938 --> 01:31:07,558
Helping old friends.
Making new ones.

843
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:09,260
Can the satellite
be shut down?

844
01:31:09,327 --> 01:31:11,261
That would take
special skills,

845
01:31:11,947 --> 01:31:13,580
and you cannot
do it alone.

846
01:31:39,808 --> 01:31:41,442
What's in the bags?

847
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:42,910
It's our gear.

848
01:31:42,977 --> 01:31:44,778
How'd you get it?

849
01:31:44,846 --> 01:31:46,113
Made a friend.

850
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:48,399
Well, I'm glad
we could help.

851
01:31:48,467 --> 01:31:50,400
You could help now.

852
01:31:50,468 --> 01:31:52,219
Look, Ethan,
before we...

853
01:31:52,287 --> 01:31:54,021
Whatever happened,
happened.

854
01:31:54,089 --> 01:31:56,974
We still have a chance to clean this up,
but we have to do it now.

855
01:31:57,843 --> 01:32:00,043
And we have to
do it together.

856
01:32:07,335 --> 01:32:08,936
Okay. So, where
are we going?

857
01:32:10,422 --> 01:32:11,589
India.

858
01:32:14,943 --> 01:32:16,510
India? India?
Sure.

859
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:17,577
Okay. Great.

860
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:23,467
Love the jet.

861
01:32:23,535 --> 01:32:25,536
Wait till you
see the car.

862
01:33:10,031 --> 01:33:10,948
Brij Nath.

863
01:33:11,015 --> 01:33:13,718
Brij Nath.
Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

864
01:33:13,785 --> 01:33:16,620
On the surface,
his entire network is state-of-the-art.

865
01:33:16,688 --> 01:33:18,655
But it's built on
illegally acquired

866
01:33:18,724 --> 01:33:22,593
Cold War cast-offs, including this,
the Novosti satellite.

867
01:33:22,661 --> 01:33:24,478
Hendricks needs it
to launch a nuclear strike,

868
01:33:24,546 --> 01:33:27,248
and we have to shut it down
before he gets that chance.

869
01:33:27,316 --> 01:33:29,900
And to do that,
we need to get the access code from him.

870
01:33:29,967 --> 01:33:31,134
One way or another.

871
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:33,954
And if I don't,

872
01:33:34,923 --> 01:33:36,623
none of this works.

873
01:33:37,709 --> 01:33:38,876
You can do this.

874
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,844
Yeah.

875
01:33:40,912 --> 01:33:43,864
A week ago,
I would have believed you.

876
01:33:48,904 --> 01:33:51,571
I don't blame you
for what happened.

877
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:57,528
She took someone
you cared about.

878
01:33:57,596 --> 01:34:00,097
That's not something
you just

879
01:34:00,164 --> 01:34:01,432
let go.

880
01:34:02,934 --> 01:34:05,035
Did it make you
feel better?

881
01:34:07,538 --> 01:34:10,474
When you killed the men
who killed your wife?

882
01:34:18,549 --> 01:34:20,450
We can't get them back.

883
01:34:26,842 --> 01:34:28,175
Okay, to shut down
the satellite,

884
01:34:28,243 --> 01:34:30,978
we have to manually tap into the central server.

885
01:34:31,046 --> 01:34:32,779
You'll enter through
the exhaust vent,

886
01:34:32,848 --> 01:34:34,681
wearing this under your suit.

887
01:34:34,749 --> 01:34:37,384
Drop down into the computer array,
and I'll catch you,

888
01:34:37,452 --> 01:34:39,086
then move you along
the relay room

889
01:34:39,154 --> 01:34:40,787
and you jack
into the panel.

890
01:34:44,492 --> 01:34:47,244
Okay, so we enter the party
separately as guests.

891
01:34:47,312 --> 01:34:48,962
Ethan quarterbacks
while Jane...

892
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:50,531
Gets the codes
from the billionaire.

893
01:34:50,599 --> 01:34:52,666
I switch off the fan,
you jump into the computer array,

894
01:34:52,734 --> 01:34:55,001
and I catch you,
you plug in the transmitter

895
01:34:55,069 --> 01:34:58,539
then Ethan feeds me the codes which I
then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

896
01:34:58,607 --> 01:35:01,809
Okay, but you just breezed over
something I think is really important.

897
01:35:01,877 --> 01:35:04,712
The computer array part,
where I just...

898
01:35:05,747 --> 01:35:06,781
Jump?

899
01:35:07,615 --> 01:35:09,250
And I catch you.
Yeah.

900
01:35:09,317 --> 01:35:11,252
I don't... Why is that
so hard to grasp?

901
01:35:11,736 --> 01:35:12,970
Well...

902
01:35:13,038 --> 01:35:17,875
Why? It's a 25-foot drop.
And we're using magnets.

903
01:35:17,942 --> 01:35:19,677
Yeah.

904
01:35:19,745 --> 01:35:22,847
In light of our recent efforts,
the technology's...

905
01:35:22,914 --> 01:35:25,016
The science is sound.
All right?

906
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:26,783
I'd be more worried
about the heat.

907
01:35:27,886 --> 01:35:30,737
And then there's that.
What heat?

908
01:35:30,805 --> 01:35:32,039
Well, it's like any
computer, isn't it?

909
01:35:32,107 --> 01:35:35,309
If you switch off the fan,
it's gonna get really hot!

910
01:35:35,377 --> 01:35:36,476
Of course.

911
01:35:36,544 --> 01:35:38,178
Relatively, you know.

912
01:35:39,481 --> 01:35:42,983
Of course it will.
So I'm jumping into a...

913
01:35:44,586 --> 01:35:47,537
Uh, an oven,
essentially.

914
01:35:47,989 --> 01:35:49,924
Yeah. Essentially.

915
01:35:49,991 --> 01:35:52,159
But, um, I'll catch you.

916
01:35:54,045 --> 01:35:55,212
Great.

917
01:36:23,925 --> 01:36:26,427
Aapka swagat hai, sir.
Welcome, sir.

918
01:37:18,062 --> 01:37:20,063
Comm check.

919
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:22,966
Saturn's got your
five-by-five, Jupiter.

920
01:37:24,519 --> 01:37:25,986
This is Pluto.

921
01:37:28,122 --> 01:37:30,391
I have arrived
at the party.

922
01:37:33,778 --> 01:37:34,928
There he is.

923
01:37:46,875 --> 01:37:48,709
Get us that code.

924
01:37:57,135 --> 01:37:59,119
Venus moving
in on target.

925
01:38:10,982 --> 01:38:12,132
Hook's in.

926
01:38:14,201 --> 01:38:16,186
You do make
an impression.

927
01:38:20,191 --> 01:38:21,425
Why am I Pluto?

928
01:38:21,493 --> 01:38:23,127
It's not even
a planet anymore.

929
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:24,962
Well, I think
Uranus is available.

930
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:27,314
It's
funny 'cause you said "anus."

931
01:38:41,696 --> 01:38:43,213
I'm in position.

932
01:38:43,298 --> 01:38:45,098
Sending in the Rover.

933
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:50,921
He's moving to you.

934
01:38:50,988 --> 01:38:53,524
Give him your back.

935
01:38:53,591 --> 01:38:55,225
Don't want to make it
too easy for him.

936
01:38:55,292 --> 01:38:57,895
Are you gonna be talking the whole time?

937
01:38:57,962 --> 01:39:01,564
In 20 minutes,
I want a glass of Cuvee Louis in every guest's hand.

938
01:39:01,632 --> 01:39:04,451
And make sure all of them have a bottle
to take home by the end of the night.

939
01:39:04,519 --> 01:39:05,619
Sure.

940
01:39:09,223 --> 01:39:10,690
Impressed yet?

941
01:39:11,709 --> 01:39:13,410
I'm more of
a bourbon girl.

942
01:39:19,467 --> 01:39:20,934
I'm Brij Nath.

943
01:39:21,002 --> 01:39:23,137
Welcome to my humble home.

944
01:39:45,643 --> 01:39:47,360
And Rover's in position.

945
01:39:48,596 --> 01:39:50,063
Spinning down the turbine.

946
01:39:57,989 --> 01:39:59,156
He's e-mailing.

947
01:39:59,224 --> 01:40:01,425
Venus. Be Venus.

948
01:40:01,493 --> 01:40:02,643
Be Venus.

949
01:40:10,901 --> 01:40:12,135
Husband?

950
01:40:12,770 --> 01:40:13,803
Boyfriend?

951
01:40:14,856 --> 01:40:16,189
More of a...

952
01:40:17,091 --> 01:40:18,124
Co-worker.

953
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:21,111
Saturn, take the leap.

954
01:40:25,533 --> 01:40:27,800
Okay.

955
01:40:30,204 --> 01:40:32,072
Jumping.

956
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:34,274
Jumping now.

957
01:40:36,211 --> 01:40:37,444
Jump now?

958
01:40:37,512 --> 01:40:39,697
Yes. Commit. Jump.

959
01:40:39,764 --> 01:40:41,431
Jump.
Jump.

960
01:40:41,499 --> 01:40:43,283
And I catch you.
Now.

961
01:40:46,821 --> 01:40:50,140
So, you're sure about this suit, right, Benji?

962
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:51,741
Pretty sure.

963
01:40:51,809 --> 01:40:54,811
Now you're pretty sure?

964
01:40:55,730 --> 01:40:56,797
Jump.

965
01:40:57,865 --> 01:40:59,999
Oh, God. All right.

966
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:02,636
Jump.

967
01:41:03,504 --> 01:41:04,555
Jump!

968
01:41:07,224 --> 01:41:08,692
Ow!

969
01:41:22,574 --> 01:41:25,092
Jupiter, he's gone.

970
01:41:29,597 --> 01:41:30,597
Did you jump?

971
01:41:30,665 --> 01:41:32,682
Should I not
have jumped?

972
01:41:33,534 --> 01:41:34,835
'Cause I jumped!

973
01:41:36,821 --> 01:41:38,288
Stand by.

974
01:41:46,147 --> 01:41:47,648
I'm playing a hunch.

975
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:50,166
Don't hit me.

976
01:42:07,602 --> 01:42:08,868
Hello?

977
01:42:08,936 --> 01:42:10,587
My God, you are

978
01:42:10,655 --> 01:42:12,655
a passionate creature.

979
01:42:14,576 --> 01:42:18,128
I would like to show you
my collection of art.

980
01:42:18,196 --> 01:42:20,263
I was waiting
for you to ask.

981
01:42:20,331 --> 01:42:22,082
Then you have
to find me.

982
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:23,350
You're on.

983
01:42:23,417 --> 01:42:25,319
I'm heading upstairs.

984
01:42:43,237 --> 01:42:44,788
All right, now be careful,

985
01:42:44,839 --> 01:42:45,972
because it's probably
getting a bit hot.

986
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:49,942
We have to get to that satellite before Hendricks does.

987
01:43:04,492 --> 01:43:07,261
Look left. Look up.

988
01:43:07,328 --> 01:43:10,197
I find your capricious
passion intriguing.

989
01:43:11,332 --> 01:43:13,734
Let me tell you one thing.
He's not your type.

990
01:43:13,801 --> 01:43:16,953
Completely not your type.
He's completely cold. I'm hot.

991
01:43:18,906 --> 01:43:21,524
Like all Indian men,
I'm very hot.

992
01:43:21,592 --> 01:43:22,426
Eight o'clock.

993
01:43:22,493 --> 01:43:23,493
Hot! Very hot.

994
01:43:23,561 --> 01:43:25,662
He's at your
eight o'clock.

995
01:43:25,729 --> 01:43:27,948
As you move towards me,
you're getting hotter.

996
01:43:28,816 --> 01:43:31,768
Whoa. Ow! Ah!
Up, up! Up, up!

997
01:43:31,835 --> 01:43:34,287
Ah! Too much,
too much, too much!

998
01:43:38,859 --> 01:43:41,828
I see you.

999
01:43:41,896 --> 01:43:45,432
I'd heard you have one of the finest
private collections in the world.

1000
01:43:45,499 --> 01:43:48,268
Well, at the very least,
it's private.

1001
01:44:07,188 --> 01:44:09,339
Saturn? How we doing
in the relay room?

1002
01:44:09,407 --> 01:44:10,257
In position.

1003
01:44:12,626 --> 01:44:14,077
I see the satellite.

1004
01:44:20,751 --> 01:44:22,018
Can I help you,
gentlemen?

1005
01:44:22,086 --> 01:44:23,653
I don't think so.

1006
01:44:30,044 --> 01:44:31,778
Need those codes, guys.

1007
01:44:40,438 --> 01:44:43,707
All originals from
Chhatarpur District.

1008
01:44:46,794 --> 01:44:50,530
You know,
the Tantrics believe

1009
01:44:50,598 --> 01:44:55,468
that the Swadhisthana chakra hides
our most subconscious of desires.

1010
01:45:15,489 --> 01:45:16,757
Mmm.

1011
01:45:47,321 --> 01:45:51,541
Uplink to satellite.
Reboot to original military specs.

1012
01:45:51,608 --> 01:45:53,276
Download the virus.

1013
01:46:01,151 --> 01:46:02,619
What the hell is that?

1014
01:46:04,355 --> 01:46:05,538
What the hell is that?

1015
01:46:05,606 --> 01:46:06,706
What the hell is what?

1016
01:46:06,774 --> 01:46:07,907
It's going haywire!

1017
01:46:07,975 --> 01:46:09,942
It's downloaded a virus
from the satellite.

1018
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:11,210
Hendricks is killing
the server

1019
01:46:11,278 --> 01:46:13,095
before we can kill
the satellite.

1020
01:46:13,163 --> 01:46:15,314
Hendricks is reprogramming
the satellite.

1021
01:46:15,382 --> 01:46:18,251
He's gonna have launch
capability in five minutes!

1022
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:20,887
Something wrong?
No.

1023
01:46:20,955 --> 01:46:23,356
Jane, you gotta move.
We need that code.

1024
01:46:23,424 --> 01:46:25,091
Finally we're alone.

1025
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:35,552
Venus, now's the time.
Kick his ass

1026
01:46:35,619 --> 01:46:37,303
and get the code.

1027
01:46:37,371 --> 01:46:41,107
We are alone,
aren't we?

1028
01:46:41,174 --> 01:46:43,843
No one will
interrupt us.

1029
01:46:48,182 --> 01:46:49,883
Move and I break your neck.

1030
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:52,551
The override sequence
for the relay station.

1031
01:46:52,619 --> 01:46:55,288
Say it now
or never speak again.

1032
01:46:55,355 --> 01:46:57,023
The codes.

1033
01:46:58,592 --> 01:47:00,760
46, 82...

1034
01:47:01,561 --> 01:47:03,029
93.

1035
01:47:06,016 --> 01:47:07,250
Benji, what happened?

1036
01:47:07,317 --> 01:47:08,835
The system's crashed!
We're too late.

1037
01:47:08,903 --> 01:47:10,736
No, no, no.
He's revealed himself.

1038
01:47:10,804 --> 01:47:12,405
Benji, can you pinpoint
Hendricks' location?

1039
01:47:13,524 --> 01:47:15,725
Uh, Hendricks is signaling
out of a state-run

1040
01:47:15,793 --> 01:47:17,443
TV station
6.7 miles from here.

1041
01:47:17,511 --> 01:47:18,845
Send me the coordinates.

1042
01:47:18,913 --> 01:47:20,446
Good work, Brandt.
Now get the hell out of there.

1043
01:47:20,514 --> 01:47:21,865
Back me up!

1044
01:47:21,933 --> 01:47:23,716
Jane, tie it off with Nath and meet me at the rally point.

1045
01:47:31,876 --> 01:47:33,977
Faster, Benji!
Just straight through!

1046
01:47:37,932 --> 01:47:39,465
Wait! Stop!

1047
01:47:39,533 --> 01:47:41,451
Take me through!

1048
01:47:41,519 --> 01:47:44,204
It's not responding!
A little bit of patience would be appreciated!

1049
01:47:59,904 --> 01:48:01,755
I can't reach the top!

1050
01:48:03,624 --> 01:48:05,441
More fan! More fan!

1051
01:48:05,509 --> 01:48:06,776
More fan!

1052
01:48:06,844 --> 01:48:08,711
There's nothing I can do!
It's maxed out!

1053
01:48:26,113 --> 01:48:27,346
Brandt?

1054
01:48:27,414 --> 01:48:28,614
Brandt?

1055
01:48:30,184 --> 01:48:33,686
Next time,
I get to seduce the rich guy.

1056
01:48:44,331 --> 01:48:46,599
Satellite weaponized
and online.

1057
01:48:46,666 --> 01:48:49,035
Upload the new
authentication codes.

1058
01:48:49,103 --> 01:48:51,437
Lock Russian Central Command
out of the system.

1059
01:48:51,505 --> 01:48:53,122
Isolate the sub.

1060
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:58,094
We'll fire just one missile,
an apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

1061
01:48:58,162 --> 01:49:00,196
That should start
the ball rolling.

1062
01:49:00,264 --> 01:49:01,214
I'm here, Ethan.

1063
01:49:01,282 --> 01:49:03,283
How long until Hendricks
can launch a missile?

1064
01:49:04,818 --> 01:49:05,718
Less than 30 seconds!

1065
01:49:07,521 --> 01:49:10,540
We need another route.

1066
01:49:10,341 --> 01:49:12,175
Turn left up ahead,
take the alley on the right.

1067
01:49:27,224 --> 01:49:28,508
We have uplink.

1068
01:49:39,170 --> 01:49:41,588
Ethan, Hendricks has started the launch sequence.

1069
01:49:41,655 --> 01:49:43,406
How much time until missiles are flying?

1070
01:49:43,474 --> 01:49:44,858
Three minutes!

1071
01:49:48,412 --> 01:49:50,080
We're three and
a half minutes out.

1072
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:54,467
We can make it.

1073
01:49:56,203 --> 01:49:57,203
We can make it.

1074
01:50:25,649 --> 01:50:27,000
Next left.

1075
01:51:02,653 --> 01:51:05,088
Ethan? We're too late.

1076
01:51:05,156 --> 01:51:06,973
The missile's in the air.

1077
01:51:19,286 --> 01:51:21,287
There has to be a way
to abort the warhead.

1078
01:51:21,355 --> 01:51:23,089
If there is one,
it'll be on the launch device.

1079
01:51:23,157 --> 01:51:24,390
We're gonna
get that case.

1080
01:51:35,069 --> 01:51:37,670
May there be
peace on Earth.

1081
01:51:42,693 --> 01:51:44,444
Disable the relay.

1082
01:51:45,629 --> 01:51:47,730
Get Wistrom!
Inside, inside!

1083
01:52:22,366 --> 01:52:24,100
Wistrom destroyed
the relay.

1084
01:52:24,168 --> 01:52:25,401
Ethan went after Hendricks
and the case, but...

1085
01:52:25,468 --> 01:52:26,619
Doesn't matter
if he has the case.

1086
01:52:26,687 --> 01:52:28,070
We can't transmit
the abort codes.

1087
01:52:28,138 --> 01:52:29,522
Can you fix it?

1088
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:31,824
Uh, yeah...
It's gonna be pointless if we don't have any power.

1089
01:52:31,892 --> 01:52:33,025
Wistrom!

1090
01:52:34,961 --> 01:52:36,646
Jane!
I'm okay.

1091
01:52:38,365 --> 01:52:41,016
No, you are not okay.
She's hit.

1092
01:52:41,084 --> 01:52:43,002
You stay here
and cover Benji.

1093
01:52:43,070 --> 01:52:45,755
Benji, get this thing rewired and back online.
I'll get the power on.

1094
01:52:45,822 --> 01:52:47,357
We can do this.

1095
01:54:10,757 --> 01:54:11,790
Ow!

1096
01:54:32,896 --> 01:54:33,930
Ow!

1097
01:56:01,852 --> 01:56:04,753
I'm taking that briefcase!

1098
01:56:08,292 --> 01:56:09,625
No! No!

1099
01:56:56,907 --> 01:56:58,340
He's been
gone too long.

1100
01:56:58,408 --> 01:57:00,159
Damn it! Listen.

1101
01:57:00,227 --> 01:57:03,162
When the power comes on,
these two drives go into this bay, okay?

1102
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:49,791
Mission accomplished!

1103
01:58:38,975 --> 01:58:41,009
This one is mine.

1104
01:58:52,956 --> 01:58:55,724
So, we are not enemies.

1105
01:58:57,660 --> 01:59:00,763
The phone call from that arms dealer in Dubai.

1106
01:59:00,731 --> 01:59:02,431
You wanted me
to find you.

1107
01:59:06,303 --> 01:59:08,337
How else to believe this?

1108
01:59:15,995 --> 01:59:17,196
Hospital?

1109
01:59:19,232 --> 01:59:21,250
And in other news,
eight weeks later,

1110
01:59:21,318 --> 01:59:23,218
the debate continues.

1111
01:59:23,286 --> 01:59:27,439
Eyewitnesses remain adamant that
the object was some sort of aircraft,

1112
01:59:27,507 --> 01:59:31,343
but officials with the Department of
Defense insist it was simply a meteor

1113
01:59:31,411 --> 01:59:34,330
large enough to be
visible during daylight.

1114
01:59:34,398 --> 01:59:36,582
You actually said that.

1115
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:38,484
Out loud.

1116
01:59:38,552 --> 01:59:39,985
"Mission accomplished."

1117
01:59:40,053 --> 01:59:41,104
I said it.

1118
01:59:41,171 --> 01:59:43,739
You're still corny,
Ethan.

1119
01:59:43,807 --> 01:59:46,642
I can't imagine the look on that guy's face.

1120
01:59:48,412 --> 01:59:50,479
Hey.
This must be them.

1121
01:59:50,547 --> 01:59:55,384
Luther Stickell, the firm of Carter,
Dunn and Brandt.

1122
01:59:55,452 --> 01:59:59,288
I blew an entire weekend on the
bottom of the San Francisco Bay

1123
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:02,391
no thanks
to you clowns.

1124
02:00:04,728 --> 02:00:07,246
No, man,
you know I got this.

1125
02:00:07,314 --> 02:00:09,782
I know.
I'll see you in Kandahar.

1126
02:00:13,586 --> 02:00:15,821
Thanks for meeting me.

1127
02:00:15,889 --> 02:00:18,124
So, I hear the insurance
company's refusing

1128
02:00:18,191 --> 02:00:20,376
to pay the claim on that car you crashed, Ethan.

1129
02:00:20,444 --> 02:00:24,329
Something about intentional 100-meter
vertical drops not being covered.

1130
02:00:24,397 --> 02:00:25,348
Go figure.

1131
02:00:28,936 --> 02:00:30,570
How's the leg?

1132
02:00:30,637 --> 02:00:31,904
Still working.

1133
02:00:32,822 --> 02:00:33,856
You?

1134
02:00:34,224 --> 02:00:35,507
Healing.

1135
02:00:37,361 --> 02:00:38,644
I'm fine, by the way.

1136
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:41,780
I mean, I'm not actually
sleeping, per se.

1137
02:00:41,848 --> 02:00:44,650
You know. Cold sweats.
Middle of the night.

1138
02:00:46,303 --> 02:00:48,904
All these people are just happy and smiling

1139
02:00:48,972 --> 02:00:50,739
and they are completely
oblivious to the fact

1140
02:00:50,807 --> 02:00:53,075
that they were
almost vaporized.

1141
02:00:53,977 --> 02:00:55,644
And if it hadn't
been for...

1142
02:00:55,712 --> 02:00:57,413
Dumb luck?

1143
02:00:57,481 --> 02:00:58,714
Was it?

1144
02:00:59,967 --> 02:01:03,386
I mean, look,
we were unprepared, in the dark.

1145
02:01:03,971 --> 02:01:05,304
Disavowed.

1146
02:01:06,506 --> 02:01:08,424
And the only thing
that functioned properly

1147
02:01:09,225 --> 02:01:10,760
on that mission

1148
02:01:11,695 --> 02:01:13,195
was this team.

1149
02:01:15,282 --> 02:01:17,983
I don't know how
we ended up together,

1150
02:01:19,636 --> 02:01:21,070
but I'm glad we did.

1151
02:01:28,545 --> 02:01:29,945
Your missions.

1152
02:01:30,697 --> 02:01:32,564
Choose to accept them.

1153
02:01:38,121 --> 02:01:40,022
Hey, look, I'm in.

1154
02:01:40,090 --> 02:01:41,757
Seriously. It's not
as if any mission

1155
02:01:41,824 --> 02:01:44,126
is gonna be rougher
than the last one, is it?

1156
02:01:44,194 --> 02:01:46,679
I mean,
that's just...

1157
02:01:46,746 --> 02:01:48,380
Bomb... Is it?

1158
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:08,317
Thanks, Ethan.

1159
02:02:08,384 --> 02:02:09,585
Thank you.

1160
02:02:11,588 --> 02:02:12,604
Agent Hunt.

1161
02:02:12,672 --> 02:02:14,139
Agent Carter.

1162
02:02:22,749 --> 02:02:23,682
Brandt.

1163
02:02:27,337 --> 02:02:29,037
I'm not picking up
that phone, Ethan,

1164
02:02:29,105 --> 02:02:31,774
because I don't think
you want me in the field.

1165
02:02:34,711 --> 02:02:36,511
I know your wife
is dead.

1166
02:02:38,681 --> 02:02:41,150
I was there in Croatia.

1167
02:02:42,619 --> 02:02:44,319
I was there
for one reason.

1168
02:02:44,387 --> 02:02:45,354
One.

1169
02:02:46,123 --> 02:02:47,589
And I failed.

1170
02:02:52,129 --> 02:02:54,363
It was my job
to protect her.

1171
02:02:54,431 --> 02:02:56,097
How do you know
she's dead?

1172
02:02:59,268 --> 02:03:00,736
There was a body.

1173
02:03:00,804 --> 02:03:02,254
Did you see it?

1174
02:03:05,742 --> 02:03:07,976
You killed
those Serbians.

1175
02:03:08,044 --> 02:03:09,061
I had to get her back.

1176
02:03:09,129 --> 02:03:10,713
You were sent
to Rankow Prison.

1177
02:03:10,781 --> 02:03:12,481
That was a sacrifice
I was willing to make.

1178
02:03:12,549 --> 02:03:15,517
IMF suspected Hendricks
had people in Rankow.

1179
02:03:18,070 --> 02:03:20,839
And six dead Serbians
was the ideal cover.

1180
02:03:22,575 --> 02:03:24,609
Waste not, want not.

1181
02:03:41,427 --> 02:03:43,528
The Secretary
never told me.

1182
02:03:47,067 --> 02:03:50,686
I accepted the Rankow Prison
mission on one condition:

1183
02:03:50,754 --> 02:03:53,154
That no one could know
she was still alive.

1184
02:03:54,524 --> 02:03:57,059
But you're telling me.

1185
02:04:04,901 --> 02:04:08,070
When did you find out
that I was in Croatia?

1186
02:04:08,137 --> 02:04:10,305
I pulled your file
after India.

1187
02:04:10,973 --> 02:04:12,174
Right.

1188
02:04:14,143 --> 02:04:17,580
So you had to fake
your wife's death.

1189
02:04:17,647 --> 02:04:21,783
As long as we were together,
she could never be safe.

1190
02:04:21,851 --> 02:04:24,669
It wasn't your job
to protect her, Brandt.

1191
02:04:27,174 --> 02:04:28,607
It's mine.

1192
02:04:30,810 --> 02:04:31,710
Okay.

1193
02:04:35,682 --> 02:04:36,949
So we're good.

1194
02:04:38,234 --> 02:04:39,601
We're good.

1195
02:05:39,428 --> 02:05:41,080
Come on!

1196
02:06:01,083 --> 02:06:03,135
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

1197
02:06:03,202 --> 02:06:06,622
36 hours ago, there was a breach in
our military's communication network.

1198
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:10,092
Now, an emerging terror
organization known as The Syndicate

1199
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:14,129
has control of our entire drone fleet.
Their targets: Unknown.

1200
02:06:14,414 --> 02:06:16,915
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it...
