1
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:46,337
<i>We were once a peaceful race</i>

2
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:49,920
<i>of intelligent, mechanical beings.</i>

3
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:52,973
<i>But then came the war</i>

4
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,598
<i>between the Autobots,
who fought for freedom</i>

5
00:00:56,688 --> 00:01:00,180
<i>and the Decepticons,
who dreamt of tyranny.</i>

6
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:06,145
<i>Overmatched and outnumbered,</i>

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,902
<i>our defeat was all but certain.</i>

8
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,205
<i>But in the war's final days,</i>

9
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,087
<i>one Autobot ship escaped the battle.</i>

10
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:30,795
<i>It was carrying a secret cargo,</i>

11
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,723
<i>which would have changed
our planet's fate.</i>

12
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,357
<i>A desperate mission.</i>

13
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:49,068
<i>Our final hope.</i>

14
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:04,462
<i>A hope that vanished.</i>

15
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,056
One up there. One over there.

16
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,266
And one more down there.

17
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,561
What you got?

18
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,696
<i>Impact detected.</i>

19
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:44,377
We have impact confirmed.
Contact at 2250 GMT.

20
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:45,871
What?

21
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:49,544
Get me SecDef on the phone
right away.

22
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:08,065
<i>Mr. McNamara,
the President is expecting you.</i>

23
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:10,696
Get Bobby in here.

24
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:13,241
Mr. President, designation, top secret.

25
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:15,489
We believe a UFO has crashed
into the Moon.

26
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,741
We think the Russians are onto it
as well.

27
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:20,323
Well, then you tell NASA
to move heaven and earth.

28
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,623
We need to get to the moon.

29
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:23,667
<i>We're going to attempt
a manned mission.</i>

30
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,665
NASA said it would take five years.

31
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,747
You get there before the Russians.

32
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,333
<i>I believe that this nation
should commit itself</i>

33
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:33,214
<i>to achieving the goal</i>

34
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,671
<i>before this decade is out</i>

35
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:39,926
<i>of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the Earth.</i>

36
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,136
<i>Ignition sequence start.</i>

37
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:47,688
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

38
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:49,359
<i>All engines running.</i>

39
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,812
<i>Liftoff. We have a liftoff.</i>

40
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:55,616
<i>Thirty-two minutes past the hour.
Liftoff on Apollo 11.</i>

41
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,868
<i>Neil Armstrong reporting Apollo 11
on proper heading.</i>

42
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,370
<i>Apollo 11 is on the way, riding that</i>

43
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,495
<i>pillar of flame</i>

44
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:09,205
<i>from the Saturn V out there,
250, 000 miles away,</i>

45
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,164
<i>where the moon is waiting</i>

46
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,376
<i>for man 's first arrival.</i>

47
00:04:16,432 --> 00:04:18,218
Houston, you're a go for landing. Over.

48
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:22,767
<i>Forty feet, down two and a half.
Picking up some dust.</i>

49
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:26,978
<i>Thirty feet, two and a half down.
Faint shadow.</i>

50
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:28,850
<i>Capcom, flight.</i>

51
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:32,904
<i>Four forward. Drifting to the right a little.</i>

52
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,234
<i>Down a half.</i>

53
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:37,821
<i>Contact light.</i>

54
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,285
<i>Okay, engine stop.</i>

55
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,246
<i>Houston,</i>

56
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,786
<i>Tranquility Base here.</i>

57
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:46,334
The Eagle has landed.

58
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,124
<i>We copy you down, Eagle.</i>

59
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:51,001
<i>You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.</i>

60
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:52,340
<i>We're breathing again.</i>

61
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:58,756
<i>Perhaps 400 million persons
are watching this broadcast today</i>

62
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,184
<i>of the greatest event in our time
and one of the great events</i>

63
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:05,262
<i>of all recorded history.</i>

64
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:07,848
<i>I'm at the foot of the ladder.</i>

65
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:11,518
<i>Okay, I'm gonna step off the LEM now.</i>

66
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:16,193
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

67
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:20,035
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

68
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:23,283
- Are we good?
- Yes, sir.

69
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:26,286
<i>Unofficial time on the first step, 109....</i>

70
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:35,300
<i>Apollo 11? This is Houston, over.</i>

71
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:38,879
Eagle, we're getting
a signal interference. Do you copy?

72
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,674
<i>We now have had confirmation</i>

73
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:43,884
<i>of loss of signal</i>

74
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:45,805
<i>from the Apollo 11.</i>

75
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:49,810
<i>The Apollo 11 is, at the moment,
on the far side of the moon.</i>

76
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,318
Neil, you are dark on the rock.

77
00:05:57,743 --> 00:05:59,324
<i>Mission is a go.</i>

78
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,819
<i>We have 21 minutes.</i>

79
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,701
<i>My God.</i>

80
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:49,875
<i>It's some sort of giant metal face.</i>

81
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:51,418
Jesus.

82
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:59,085
<i>Control, we are inside the ship.</i>

83
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:05,225
<i>Extensive damage.</i>

84
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:07,928
<i>Way too big to check the entire ship.</i>

85
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:16,107
<i>Everything's dead in here, Houston.</i>

86
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:18,028
<i>No signs of life anywhere.</i>

87
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:21,984
<i>These things are massive.</i>

88
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:26,577
We copy. You've got seven minutes
on your oxygen.

89
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:29,037
<i>We are not alone after all, are we?</i>

90
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:31,915
<i>No, sir. We're not alone.</i>

91
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,163
<i>Go ahead, Mr. President.</i>

92
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:37,842
<i>Hello, Neil and Buzz.
I'm talking to you by telephone</i>

93
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:40,511
<i>from the Oval Room
at the White House.</i>

94
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:45,550
<i>And this certainly has to be the most
historic telephone call ever made.</i>

95
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:50,764
<i>I just can't tell you
how proud we all are of you.</i>

96
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:54,851
<i>For every American, this has to be
the proudest day of our lives.</i>

97
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:57,899
<i>Because of what you have done....</i>

98
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,571
<i>We have splashdown.</i>

99
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:02,233
<i>.... the heavens have become a part</i>

100
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,909
<i>of man 's world.</i>

101
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:07,287
<i>For one priceless moment</i>

102
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:10,283
<i>in the whole history of man</i>

103
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:15,371
<i>all the people on this Earth
are truly one.</i>

104
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,001
<i>One in their pride
in what you have done.</i>

105
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,596
<i>It inspires us to redouble our efforts</i>

106
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:28,268
<i>to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.</i>

107
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:05,338
My hero needs to wake up.

108
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:20,728
What is that?

109
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:23,901
This is your new lucky bunny.

110
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:29,365
It's a beautiful thought, Carly,

111
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:31,823
but I don't think
it's the whole bunny that's lucky.

112
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,703
You see, it's just this section here.

113
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:36,369
You see,
it's just the rabbit foot that's lucky.

114
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:42,509
Well, it's just a good luck charm.
To help you think positive?

115
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,377
Today's important.

116
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,755
Come on, get up.

117
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,966
- Hey, wear that nice tie.
- Yeah.

118
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:52,139
You need any money for lunch?

119
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:57,481
No, I don't need any money for lunch.
I have money from yesterday's lunch.

120
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:00,772
You love it, don't you?
I'm just your American boy toy.

121
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,395
A lover boy toy.

122
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,402
You know how demoralizing it is
to have saved the world twice

123
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:06,733
and still be groveling for a job?

124
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:09,068
People don't know
you saved the world, Sam.

125
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:10,949
I mean, I do. I believe you.

126
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,905
The government knows. I mean,
they could hook me up with a job

127
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,081
right here in D. C.

128
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:16,785
I mean, I should be working
with the Autobots, otherwise it's not fair.

129
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:21,086
Come on, they paid for your college.
The President gave you a hero medal.

130
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:24,259
<i>Thank you, man. Great job.</i>

131
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:28,971
That's the coolest thing
that ever happened to me.

132
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:30,265
All right, guys.

133
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:33,094
- What the fuck!
- Wow.

134
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:36,680
And, as I recall, that wasn't even
the highlight of your day.

135
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:39,479
Mr. Ambassador, here.

136
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:40,726
British Embassy, you're up next.

137
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:49,738
No, you don't wear it.
See, you've gotta... The box.

138
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,945
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

139
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,654
You're supposed to leave it
in the box, right?

140
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,956
You keep it in this.
What a gorgeous box.

141
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,588
Oh, yeah. My medal.
You know who gave that to me?

142
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:08,219
- Who?
- POUTS.

143
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:11,469
President of the United States.

144
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,184
Babe, it's hard for everybody
to get a job.

145
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,391
I don't have time. You see, my parents
are gonna be here in a week

146
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,567
on their road trip Partybus World Tour.

147
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,815
If my dad gets here
and I don't have a job,

148
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,572
he's gonna spank me.
You know, it's go time for me.

149
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:28,775
All right, tonight, I'll give you a job.

150
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:33,992
Romance me with a nice dinner
and maybe you can get that bonus.

151
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:40,377
- Get lucky.
- Get him out of here.

152
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,589
Wait. No, no, no, no.

153
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:45,963
- Oh, he's gross!
- She's good.

154
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:47,840
They're stranded here. Somebody's
got to watch out for them.

155
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:50,263
Yesterday, that one was
in my underwear drawer.

156
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:52,425
Did research. Looking real good, too.

157
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:54,055
No need to hit me.

158
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,138
- You are not a normal boyfriend.
- That's what you love about me.

159
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:59,348
- Crybaby.
- We're not at the love word yet.

160
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:02,355
Maybe a little bit closer when you're
covering your half of the rent.

161
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,270
Good-bye.

162
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:07,273
Frickin' shorting my circuits out here!

163
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:10,825
It's inhumane, what it is!
Make us live in a box

164
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:14,201
on a balcony, right next to a beast!
Like a common animal!

165
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,371
Stop, okay?

166
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,871
You and your creepy sidekick
can't be in here without permission.

167
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,826
According to who?
Miss Blondie Blonde?

168
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,787
Giddyup, little doggie!

169
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:27,085
- Yo, Brains, wassup?
- Doing good.

170
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,842
Shit, I seen this one.
It's the one where Spock goes nuts.

171
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:33,800
You know, Sam, I don't know
about moving in with this chick.

172
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:35,759
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

173
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:37,894
She was mean. Didn't like her.

174
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,517
Us guys got to stick together.

175
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,148
<i>We are family</i>

176
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,066
No, we are not family.
You're a political refugee,

177
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,443
and I have finally found someone
who appreciates me for me.

178
00:12:49,993 --> 00:12:51,529
Well, you tell her
that we're not your pets,

179
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,905
and we're not your toys!

180
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:56,113
All right? We're an advanced, genius
alien race just looking for a home.

181
00:12:59,253 --> 00:13:01,039
- Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.
- Didn't have to stop.

182
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:02,710
Come on.
What're they going to do, tow it?

183
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,333
Where is he?

184
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:06,339
Sammy!

185
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:10,344
- Come on, that's funny!
- Sam.

186
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:12,593
I missed you guys so much.

187
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:14,515
Sure, you did. What do you think?

188
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:15,842
- Look at that.
- Cute.

189
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:17,393
- You look old.
- Stop it.

190
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,560
Feel like I can see the end.

191
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,730
I love your little tie.
Hey, where's my girl?

192
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,432
- Where's my beautiful Carly?
- She's at work, Ma.

193
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,768
She's got a new job. You guys said
you were gonna be here in a week.

194
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:26,193
The 21st, not the 11th, Dad, remember?

195
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:27,612
We just hauled ass in this thing.

196
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:30,532
- We stopped for gas.
- This thing. The love tub, it flies.

197
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:34,535
Are we keeping you from something?
Like, say, your job?

198
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:36,954
Well, it's about time.
You had us worried.

199
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,204
I have job interviews.

200
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:44,420
That's good.

201
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,963
- That sucks.
- Stop it.

202
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,960
You don't have to be so negative, Dad.
You know, you're in D. C.

203
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,291
You're here with your son
and your family.

204
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:51,342
- I mean, it's a good time.
- It sucks that you don't have a job.

205
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,136
Yeah, but there's good things
to do here, too, right?

206
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,963
Right? Museums
and monuments, okay?

207
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:56,594
- I'll see you tonight.
- I'm bagging the gift.

208
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,476
Sam, I think for an interview
you should wear real pants.

209
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:01,804
I think for life,
you should wear real pants.

210
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:04,264
What happened to Bumblebee?

211
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:06,475
He's off on his missions.
I had to get this for backup.

212
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,277
- Your car has a job, huh?
- Stop.

213
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:11,150
What does it change into?

214
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,277
It doesn't change into anything.
It's a collector's item, Ma.

215
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,324
I got it for a steal.
It just needs some work. Trust me.

216
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:18,119
No, I think it's darling.
It reminds me a lot of Bumblebee,

217
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,239
if Bumblebee were a sad piece of shit.

218
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:26,253
Come on, we'll give you a ride!

219
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:31,003
<i>In the years since our arrival,
our new home, Earth,</i>

220
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:33,210
<i>has seen much change.</i>

221
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,384
<i>Energon detectors guard its cities now.</i>

222
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:40,184
<i>Long-range defense systems
watch the skies.</i>

223
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:46,475
<i>So now we assist our allies
in solving human conflicts,</i>

224
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,941
<i>to prevent mankind
from bringing harm to itself.</i>

225
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,667
<i>On the ground, per favore!
And stay there!</i>

226
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:32,147
<i>We work in secret teams
on various missions around the globe.</i>

227
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,690
<i>And all the while</i>

228
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:38,778
<i>we search for signs
of our true enemies' return.</i>

229
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,622
<i>I am Voshkod, General Counsel
with Ukrainian Department of Energy.</i>

230
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,577
<i>My government will officially deny</i>

231
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:49,664
that we're having this conversation.

232
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:53,216
At one of our decommissioned facilities,
a discovery was made,

233
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:56,761
which I fear may be alien in nature.

234
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,593
The facility's name is Chernobyl.

235
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,364
Mr. Voshkod.

236
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:25,287
So, uninhabited since '86.

237
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:28,874
I hear it won't be livable again
for another 20,000 years?

238
00:16:29,132 --> 00:16:32,295
At least.
Ukraine was the most fertile land.

239
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:33,670
It's a tragedy.

240
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:35,175
This way.

241
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:38,679
Gear up!
We have 60 minutes on the ground.

242
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,802
Watch your radiation levels.

243
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,434
Mr. Voshkod,
where's your protective gear?

244
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,316
Where's your protective gear?

245
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:55,487
It would not matter.

246
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:58,320
For me, it's only a matter of time.

247
00:16:58,411 --> 00:16:59,696
Through the school.

248
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,664
Yuri will take you below.
And one other thing, Colonel.

249
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:07,663
In private,
there were some energy experiments.

250
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:12,042
It can wait.

251
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,642
Keep moving. Stay tight.

252
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,850
Okay, right here. I think I found it.

253
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:35,104
Optimus, we got a visual.

254
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:41,110
Looks like the object's clamped
in some kind of a metal harness.

255
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:45,197
What's this? Guys!

256
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:47,833
Why does this thing have
Soviet space program markings on it?

257
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:50,373
Sputnik?

258
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:53,080
Energon readings, sir. It's strong.

259
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,631
Below us. It's coming fast.

260
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:05,426
Contact, contact!

261
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:21,483
Get topside now! Move, move, move!

262
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:51,309
- Let's go!
- Weapons up! Heavy weapons up!

263
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:53,140
Stay behind me!

264
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:56,652
Optimus!

265
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:03,358
Fall back!

266
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:05,861
It's circling around us!

267
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:07,704
It's taking our flank!

268
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:15,128
Get the heavy weapon!

269
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:19,292
Optimus!

270
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:37,026
What the hell was that thing?

271
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:39,404
That

272
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:41,523
is Shockwave.

273
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:44,909
Why was he after this?

274
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,321
It's impossible.

275
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:53,077
This is an engine part
from a long lost Autobot ship.

276
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:19,728
Pleasure working with you.

277
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,528
Interviews. This is so exciting.

278
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:26,443
Honey, do you want some gum?

279
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,281
Your breath gets really gnarly
when you're nervous.

280
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,083
- Mr. Witwicky?
- Yeah. Search is over.

281
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:34,960
I'm Mr. Whitley.

282
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:37,000
Mr...

283
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,590
- Is anybody else joining?
- No.

284
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:42,001
No? You want me to move right there?

285
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:43,131
- I'll move right there.
- I'd prefer not.

286
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,176
Ready? Begin.

287
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:48,679
Graduated this year. Majored
in geopolitics. Minor in tech studies.

288
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,179
Very interested in government
and technology,

289
00:20:50,271 --> 00:20:51,602
how that's gonna intersect and co-exist.

290
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:52,895
Shape the future.

291
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:55,894
Why did we bother sending him
to an lvy college for?

292
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:58,226
Three months out of school
and he can't find a job?

293
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,810
Mr. Masuhisu...

294
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:01,065
Matsumoto.

295
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:02,693
- Matsumoto.
- Moto.

296
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,569
- Martha, can I call you Martha?
- No, you may not.

297
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,571
Okay, Jack,
there's two types of people in this world.

298
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,994
There's think ers, there's doers.

299
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,249
There's winners, there's dreamers,
and there's buddies.

300
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:15,326
What about some weaknesses?

301
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,203
I don't...

302
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:18,504
You have a very trustworthy face.

303
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:21,003
You remind me of
like an Asian Colonel Sanders.

304
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,583
A man I can trust.

305
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:23,633
He's a millennial.

306
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:26,212
That means they're the, you know,
like lost generation.

307
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:28,138
Why was the FBI looking for you?

308
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:30,136
The what?

309
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:31,592
Yeah, FBI. Good of you to flag that.

310
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:34,770
It was during all that alien craziness
when you were 14.

311
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:36,688
I mean, they were very kind to me,
found me in a jiffy.

312
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:39,942
And that's all been expunged.
Obama gave me a medal, actually.

313
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm just saying.
It's always good to have a medal guy

314
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:43,980
in the office, with a medal.

315
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:45,693
- From Obama?
- Yeah.

316
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:49,573
In this office,
we're mostly Republicans, so...

317
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,115
I'm not feeling too good.

318
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:52,196
- No?
- No.

319
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,282
Why don't you get a little dipping tray
and dip the dog in Pepto?

320
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:55,537
That's a solution.

321
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:57,039
I got another one. We got to go.

322
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,245
- Come on.
- Really?

323
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:00,751
Sit.

324
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,172
Got myself a Mr. Sam Witwicky,
recent college graduate.

325
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:07,754
Previous experience, next to zero,

326
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:11,759
yet he has a recommend letter
from our board?

327
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:14,052
WTF to that.

328
00:22:14,397 --> 00:22:16,604
- Do I know somebody on your board?
- Here's the deal.

329
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:18,602
You know who we are.
Accuretta Systems,

330
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:23,153
global leader in telecom, aerospace,
17 billion in profit last year.

331
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,573
We contract for DARPA, NASA, JPL,
you name it.

332
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,402
You perform here,
doors open for you anywhere.

333
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:32,158
First job out of college is critical, kid.

334
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:35,036
You either take a step
down the correct career path

335
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:38,584
or you fall into a life-sucking abyss.

336
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:43,207
So it all depends on how you respond
to my next two words.

337
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:45,083
Impress me.

338
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:48,010
- Now?
- Impress me.

339
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:49,213
You catch me off guard.

340
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:50,592
- I don't know where to begin.
- Impress me.

341
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:51,969
I'm an open book.
Ask me any question you like.

342
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,016
- So you're a go-getter, ramrod...
- Yes, sir.

343
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:55,219
...take-charge kind of guy?

344
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:58,020
I'm a killer. A stone-cold killer.

345
00:22:58,108 --> 00:22:59,223
So, take-charge guy?

346
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:01,854
Tak e-charge, Viking, barbarian,
of course, that's me.

347
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:03,435
Pow! I'm here.

348
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,367
We are not looking for that here.

349
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:16,115
No brown-nosing. No suck up.
No toolery. I...

350
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:21,040
<i>Yes, Mr. Brazos.</i>

351
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:26,047
Why is Shontel using
what appears to be a red cup

352
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:27,502
from the red floor

353
00:23:27,597 --> 00:23:30,054
<i>- when we are on the yellow floor?
- I'm on it.</i>

354
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:34,805
It is a visual and, therefore,
a visceral betrayal.

355
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:36,598
Stop it!

356
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:38,721
Such a dumbass.

357
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:40,857
Disgusting!

358
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:43,268
Thank you!

359
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:45,649
It's total anarchy around here.

360
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:51,448
The e-mail I read
said administrative aide?

361
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:53,241
Nope. Mailroom.

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,240
I'm gonna go.

363
00:23:57,044 --> 00:24:00,912
Do you have any idea how many
lvy League Phi Beta Kappas

364
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,214
- would kill to...
- Mister, I saved your life twice. Okay?

365
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:06,713
I can't tell you how or when or why,

366
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:08,088
but I have done shit that matters

367
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,547
and I'd just kind of like a job
where I matter again.

368
00:24:12,224 --> 00:24:13,885
So thank you, but no, thank you, okay?

369
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:17,181
You know what I think?
You want the job after this job.

370
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:20,354
But, son, this is the job
that's standing in your way.

371
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:23,771
And that's why you're gonna be
so very, very good at it.

372
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:26,352
'Cause when I look at you,
I see a younger me.

373
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:50,260
<i>All arriving Autobots, in par,
training and debriefing in 15 minutes.</i>

374
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,719
<i>Dino, report to Bay 23.</i>

375
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:59,220
<i>Sideswipe, Bay 37
for weapons assessment.</i>

376
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,731
Senator, I suggest you remember that

377
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:06,151
when the NSA wants funding,
they call me.

378
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,729
When the CIA
is gonna take out a target,

379
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:10,564
they ask first for my permission.

380
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:11,865
And when the President wants to know

381
00:25:11,952 --> 00:25:14,068
which members of Congress
are politically vulnerable

382
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:17,996
in terms of, let's say,
undiscovered criminal conduct,

383
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,323
I'm the number he dials.

384
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,909
<i>U. S. Agencies say
they have been monitoring the blast.</i>

385
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:24,666
<i>But if, in fact,
this was a covert military strike,</i>

386
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:27,089
<i>- no nation has claimed responsibility.
- CIA is up my ass</i>

387
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:28,665
about this mystery raid
in the Middle East.

388
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,002
So, it's time to come clean.
Was your unit involved?

389
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,212
I'm not sure, ma'am.

390
00:25:33,306 --> 00:25:37,390
All right, guys. This is how you do
a Decepticon head kill shot.

391
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,302
As Director of National Intelligence,

392
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:42,262
I'm a really big fan
of intelligent answers.

393
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:45,849
I can't really tell you definitively.
These Autobots are like teenage kids.

394
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,684
They like to sneak out of the house
every once in a while.

395
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,985
Colonel Lennox, are you in command
or are you not?

396
00:25:49,072 --> 00:25:50,403
Yes, ma'am, I am.

397
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,446
Stop with the "ma'am."
Enough with the "ma'am."

398
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:53,899
Do I look like a "ma'am"?

399
00:25:53,994 --> 00:25:56,076
No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes.

400
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:58,946
This gun
is my perfect invention, Ironhide.

401
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,030
Right.

402
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,831
Good, you're here!

403
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,040
Me name's Que.

404
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,915
I do hope you have answers for him.
I've never seen him so upset.

405
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:08,338
Optimus, you remember
Charlotte Mearing?

406
00:26:08,425 --> 00:26:10,586
Our Director of National Intelligence?

407
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:14,295
He's in a bad mood.
He's not talking to anybody today.

408
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:17,882
What is this, the silent treatment?

409
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,639
- We've seen that and this is not that.
- Definitely not.

410
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,436
This is worse.

411
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:24,980
Prime! Make something of yourself!

412
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,316
He's pissed.

413
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,865
You lied to us.

414
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:39,116
Everything humans know of our planet
we were told had all been shared.

415
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:41,949
So why was this found
in human possession?

416
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:44,284
We were in the dark on this also.

417
00:26:44,378 --> 00:26:47,370
It was Director Only clearance
at Sector 7 until now.

418
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:48,545
The bag.

419
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:52,379
- Which bag?
- Hermès. Birkin. Green ostrich!

420
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:54,836
Oh, my God.

421
00:26:56,182 --> 00:27:00,391
This is a secret few men knew,
and fewer still remain alive.

422
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:01,968
Allow me to please introduce to you

423
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:04,645
two of NASA's
founding mission directors

424
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:06,939
and astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin,

425
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:09,438
one of the first two men
to step foot on the moon.

426
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:12,271
Sir? Optimus Prime.

427
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:17,859
From a fellow space traveler,
it's a true honor.

428
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:19,364
The honor is mine.

429
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:24,374
Our entire space race of the 1960s,
it appears, was in response to an event.

430
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:30,213
Our astronauts investigated
a crashed alien ship.

431
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:31,831
<i>No survivors onboard.</i>

432
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:35,092
We were sworn to secrecy
by our Commander in Chief.

433
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:38,929
This was a mission
you will never speak of.

434
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:40,096
I understand, sir.

435
00:27:40,184 --> 00:27:44,393
A total of 35 people
knew the real plan at NASA.

436
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:47,439
Soviets managed to land
unmanned probes.

437
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,810
Somehow they must have picked up
that fuel rod.

438
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:53,275
We believe the Russians deduced

439
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,402
that the rod
was a fissionable fuel assembly,

440
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:58,576
believed they had it mastered,
and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.

441
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,995
We landed six missions in all.

442
00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:03,698
<i>We took hundreds of photos
and samples.</i>

443
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:05,579
<i>We locked them away forever,</i>

444
00:28:05,712 --> 00:28:07,498
and the moon program was shut down.

445
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,830
Well, did you search the crash vault?

446
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:15,506
<i>The ship's name was the Ark.</i>

447
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:18,509
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.

448
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:23,226
It was carrying an Autobot technology
which would have won us the war.

449
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,304
And its captain.

450
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:27,222
Who was its captain?

451
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:31,230
The great Sentinel Prime,
the technology's inventor.

452
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:35,064
He was commander of the Autobots
before me.

453
00:28:35,158 --> 00:28:36,773
It's imperative that I find it

454
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:39,780
before the Decepticons learn
of its location.

455
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:43,784
Our Autobot spacecraft
has the ability to get there.

456
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,458
And you must pray it's in time.

457
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,091
Hi. I'm here to see Carly Spencer.

458
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:08,813
Carly!

459
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:15,900
- You got the job?
- This is crazy.

460
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:17,151
- You really got it?
- Yes.

461
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:19,484
See, what did I tell you? It's the bunny.

462
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:21,777
You are so welcome.

463
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:23,988
- Do you like me more?
- A little bit, yeah.

464
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:25,197
You said you were his assistant curator,

465
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:26,747
you didn't say
the guy owns Space Mountain.

466
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:31,077
I know. Isn't it beautiful in here?
And he's the coolest guy. Ever.

467
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:32,287
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

468
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:33,462
Sam.

469
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,750
Dylan Gould.

470
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:40,174
Hey. A pleasure to meet you.

471
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:43,257
Pleasure meeting you.
Carly's told me a lot about you.

472
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:45,683
Well, vice versa.
It's a beautiful building you got.

473
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,306
<i>It's like the Starship Enterprise in here.</i>

474
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:48,933
Thank you very much. It leaks.

475
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:50,888
Before Carly came
to help run the collection,

476
00:29:50,984 --> 00:29:52,690
it was just a complete mess.

477
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:55,018
But now,
the restorations are back on track.

478
00:29:55,113 --> 00:29:56,148
We're going to Pebble Beach this year,

479
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:58,275
and we're gonna get a trophy
for that stand right there.

480
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:01,199
You know why?
Because this woman right here

481
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:03,613
- is my secret weapon.
- Okay.

482
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:07,118
Mr. Gould, please, you exaggerate.
All I've done is get you organized.

483
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,745
You've done much more than that,
my Duchess.

484
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,373
Nicknames, that's fun.

485
00:30:12,463 --> 00:30:14,454
Yeah. The Duchess.

486
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:15,629
She's adorable.

487
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,006
You know, when I stole her away
from the British Embassy,

488
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:19,675
I said, "It's easy to manage a country.

489
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:22,128
"Try managing
a priceless collection of art."

490
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:26,933
Tak e a look
at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

491
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,100
Designed by a Frenchman.

492
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,393
Look at the curves.
Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.

493
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:35,024
Sensual.

494
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:37,360
Built to evoke the body
of the ideal woman.

495
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:40,063
Come on.

496
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:44,694
My dad had a $ 10 desk and a dream,
and he built it into an empire.

497
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:46,411
Wow.

498
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:48,739
We're the largest accounting firm
in the U.S.

499
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:52,827
I started up the venture side
after he passed. Invest in the future.

500
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:55,162
Try and bet on the winners.

501
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:57,999
See, collecting cars helps me
keep my sanity.

502
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:06,465
You guys look great.

503
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:10,886
That was a great day, Mr. Gould.

504
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:13,017
- I haven't seen that one.
- No. Me, neither.

505
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:14,723
Jeans are tight.

506
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:19,149
Here we go. Here we go. You see that?

507
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,729
Judgment. Judging a man by his car?

508
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:22,405
And you're gonna wave at him
while he's judging me?

509
00:31:22,493 --> 00:31:25,701
What's with you? He's my boss.
This job pays for our food, our rent.

510
00:31:25,788 --> 00:31:28,404
No, I totally understand.
I'm totally fine. I get it. I'm well fed.

511
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:30,205
And guess what?
I'm not your boy toy anymore.

512
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:31,998
I got my big boy pants on.
You see them?

513
00:31:32,086 --> 00:31:33,292
In the car. Thank you, Duchess.

514
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:36,086
Oh, my God.
Are you threatened by him?

515
00:31:40,552 --> 00:31:43,589
Threatened? What am I threatened by?
His money? His power? His good looks?

516
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,045
None of the above. Check!

517
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,176
God! Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

518
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:49,383
Get in the car, please.

519
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:52,470
Sam, he's hardly the first man
to ever smile at me.

520
00:31:52,564 --> 00:31:53,849
- I think I can handle it.
- Hold on, hold on.

521
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:57,183
It's the smiling back part
that gets me. Okay?

522
00:31:57,277 --> 00:31:58,983
No more smiles. Never again. I promise.

523
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:00,816
That works for me.

524
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:10,907
Easy! Easy!
You're not gonna get it started that way.

525
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:14,038
Well, I was just getting it ready.
I'm about 32% done with my restoration.

526
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,212
Some chrome work,
put a spoiler on the back. Done deal.

527
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,623
You know, Carly's been telling me
you've been struggling job-wise.

528
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:20,256
Just so you know,

529
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:23,677
I'm on the board for Accuretta Systems,
and I put in a call for you.

530
00:32:24,014 --> 00:32:26,847
Let's keep it between us, okay?
She's so proud of you.

531
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:29,308
You're a lucky man.

532
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:35,640
<i>Xanthium approaching Tranquility Base.</i>

533
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:38,442
<i>You're a go for landing.</i>

534
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:47,155
Ratchet, let's roll.

535
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:06,674
<i>We're entering the Ark.</i>

536
00:33:29,205 --> 00:33:30,991
His levels are faint.

537
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,753
He locked himself away
to guard the pillars.

538
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:39,625
Sentinel.

539
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,250
You're coming home, old friend.

540
00:34:23,343 --> 00:34:27,507
All hail Megatron.

541
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:37,555
My master! Yes, my master! Yes!

542
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:46,813
Don't be greedy, my fragile ones.

543
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,116
My poor master.

544
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:56,197
How it pains me to see you so wounded,
so weak.

545
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:59,580
Spare me, you gaseous sycophant!

546
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,628
You know what you are told,
which is nothing.

547
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:13,090
Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.

548
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:17,097
And what news
from your little assassin?

549
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:19,395
Autobots have taken the bait!

550
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:23,066
<i>They've discovered the Ark
and returned with its cargo.</i>

551
00:35:23,653 --> 00:35:28,022
You did me great honor
tracking that ship to the moon.

552
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:33,577
Your human collaborators
have served their purpose, Soundwave.

553
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:37,827
It's time to eliminate loose ends.

554
00:35:38,918 --> 00:35:42,001
<i>Laserbeak, kill them all.</i>

555
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:43,624
<i>With pleasure.</i>

556
00:35:57,062 --> 00:35:58,302
Is your daddy home?

557
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:01,350
- "Then Madeline said..."
- Madeline!

558
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:04,103
Hello, Mom.

559
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:10,192
Get out of the house!

560
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:13,117
- What are you doing in my house?
- Just visiting.

561
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,671
What is this hoochie-mama outfit?

562
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:37,676
No, this is the aerospace division!
We do not allow that here!

563
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:39,853
New guy! You see that?
That's a Latin meltdown, okay?

564
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,306
You ever show up in my office
with a hoochie-mama outfit, you're fired.

565
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,436
You got that?

566
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,688
Okay, you're gonna be on this cart
for two-and-a-half years, okay?

567
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:47,064
I want you to live it, love it and name it.

568
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:50,155
There's no ladder climbing in my office.
I run a tight ship. Okay?

569
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,573
- Yes, sir.
- Move!

570
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:13,549
I found that paper
I was telling you about.

571
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,346
- What are we looking at?
- Shut up!

572
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,969
You do that to me again,
and I'll kick your ass!

573
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:24,939
Hi.

574
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:26,141
Hi, angel.

575
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:27,601
- How are you?
- Good.

576
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,562
I had a meeting downtown.
Was it okay for me to stop by?

577
00:37:30,657 --> 00:37:32,693
I don't know.
My 500-page employee conduct manual

578
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:33,899
isn't exactly a page turner.

579
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,029
This is great.

580
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,827
Yeah, Autobots are off saving the world,
and I have organized four binders.

581
00:37:37,914 --> 00:37:39,324
I'm living the dream. Come on.

582
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:42,787
Visitor violation.

583
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:48,122
- You okay?
- Absolutely.

584
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:53,130
I'm next.

585
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:58,348
Listen. Saturday.
Dylan's throwing a party at his house.

586
00:37:58,436 --> 00:38:00,017
It's a work thing,
but he's invited you, too.

587
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:01,093
Did he?

588
00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:02,554
I want you to come
and laugh at my bad jokes.

589
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,138
It would really mean a lot to me, okay?

590
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,019
I'd love to go. How'd you get over here?

591
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:08,939
- Car.
- You don't have a car.

592
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:12,150
- Yes, I do.
- What, did you win it in a raffle?

593
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:13,606
He gave me one.

594
00:38:13,701 --> 00:38:14,781
He gave you a car?

595
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:16,450
Yeah, I think it was a work perk.

596
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:17,652
A work perk.

597
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:22,286
- What kind of car did he give you?
- A Mercedes SLS AMG.

598
00:38:23,294 --> 00:38:24,625
Really throaty engine.

599
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:27,753
<i>Mercedes-Benz SLS</i>

600
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:30,339
<i>- combines breathtaking performance....
- You drove this here?</i>

601
00:38:31,594 --> 00:38:32,925
That's a $200, 000 car.

602
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,965
I know.

603
00:38:35,056 --> 00:38:36,887
You know how long it would take me
to afford a car like this?

604
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:39,970
- A long time?
- Yeah, like 53 years.

605
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:41,346
He said it was for both of us.

606
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:43,473
Then what we should do is,
we should sell it and buy a house.

607
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:47,390
You're frustrated, I know.

608
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:48,733
I've been there.

609
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,358
It's called paying your dues.
Good things will happen.

610
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:53,733
Ladies and gentlemen,

611
00:38:53,825 --> 00:38:56,316
I need some lunch time filing done, stat.

612
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,527
Who would like
to score some Bruce Brazos points?

613
00:38:59,622 --> 00:39:01,658
Bruce, you found your guy.

614
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:04,744
Witwicky!

615
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:07,581
The man who makes this company run.

616
00:39:08,548 --> 00:39:09,879
Now, who have we here?

617
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:12,799
Is it a sister, Facebook friend,
Twitter tweeter?

618
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:15,092
- Carly, this is Bruce. Bruce.
- Hi.

619
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:17,511
I'm his girlfriend.
A pleasure to meet you. Sam was right.

620
00:39:17,598 --> 00:39:19,304
You really do have
a smashing head of hair.

621
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:20,757
Well, thank you.

622
00:39:22,186 --> 00:39:23,346
- Sam, I got to run.
- Yeah.

623
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:26,225
Here, your present.

624
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:28,686
Your favorite color.

625
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:32,277
- N ice to meet you, Mr. Brazos.
- And you.

626
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:36,197
See you, boys.

627
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,373
I'm still stewing about
that binder incident, Jerry.

628
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:47,576
May I finish my Shuhua milk, Donny?

629
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:50,913
I don't care about your exotic milk.
I care about respect!

630
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:11,808
I know who you are!

631
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:13,484
Witwicky! Witwicky!

632
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:17,025
- I'm talking to you!
- Excuse me. Thank you.

633
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,115
Slow down, tiger.

634
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:22,034
You showed up in the background
of six different photos,

635
00:40:22,122 --> 00:40:23,737
two continents, with aliens.

636
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:28,201
That was you in Egypt, right?
Because you know the aliens.

637
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,876
See you!

638
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,171
Give me my jacket!

639
00:40:40,557 --> 00:40:44,175
I'm Wang. Deep Wang. Deep Wang.

640
00:40:44,353 --> 00:40:45,718
You're not getting it. Deep Throat.

641
00:40:46,188 --> 00:40:48,019
Watergate? I'm talking code to you...

642
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:49,597
Damn it.

643
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:52,475
They watch and listen.

644
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,362
I can't go to the government,
but you can!

645
00:40:56,616 --> 00:40:59,779
Because shit's going down, son!
It is Code Pink, as in Floyd!

646
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:02,531
Dark Side! Why do you think
no one's been up there since 1972?

647
00:41:02,872 --> 00:41:06,080
I know you're speaking English,
it's just a very strange English.

648
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,328
That's why I'm not...

649
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:10,080
Don't. I'm gonna hit you.

650
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,836
I'm gonna hit you right back, son.

651
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,796
It's my manifesto.

652
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:15,127
They're whacking us out,

653
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:16,799
everyone who knows
what's on the dark...

654
00:41:18,054 --> 00:41:20,591
Your alien friends are in danger,
you know, the good ones. It's up to you.

655
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:23,009
Calm down.

656
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:25,721
Easy, Sam!

657
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:36,860
What are you looking at?

658
00:41:36,948 --> 00:41:38,358
Yo, dawg.

659
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:41,737
Are you up in my shit?
Who are you working for?

660
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:45,324
Staredown, you and me.

661
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,406
Guess I won.

662
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:52,994
Moon satellites.

663
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:56,247
The Russian space program.

664
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,466
Experts dead.

665
00:41:59,178 --> 00:42:00,258
Space program ends.

666
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,137
Dark side... Dark side of the moon.

667
00:42:03,641 --> 00:42:06,098
Look what I found outside the bathroom.
Is it yours?

668
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:08,221
- Deal with this.
- Yes, sir.

669
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:12,559
I did everything you want!

670
00:42:12,692 --> 00:42:14,353
I really think we should talk,
'cause some of the stuff...

671
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,184
Whoa! Knock first!

672
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:17,564
Can't you see I'm busy?

673
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:19,653
Who are you? Who are you?

674
00:42:20,576 --> 00:42:22,066
You straddled me in the stall.

675
00:42:22,494 --> 00:42:25,031
That's happened to me once in this life.
I wouldn't forget it.

676
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:27,822
From the bathroom stall.
You took your package out.

677
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:31,283
- You took your package out.
- Whoa! We are not boyfriends, okay?

678
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,706
One phone call from me
and I'll have you fired.

679
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:35,628
Yes, I will, Gaylord!

680
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:37,213
Are you okay?

681
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:40,125
Hemorrhoids!

682
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,960
Should I come back?
When should I come back?

683
00:42:42,056 --> 00:42:43,796
Come back
when you learn some manners!

684
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:50,553
I don't know him!
I would never say anything!

685
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:56,065
Okay, okay!
I sabotaged the mapping satellite,

686
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:57,188
just like I promised,

687
00:42:57,279 --> 00:42:58,985
I can put a blind spot in the program
as a bonus.

688
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:00,859
What more do you want from me?

689
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:04,737
Jerry, you are my favorite.

690
00:43:04,828 --> 00:43:06,409
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

691
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:10,456
I know, but my superiors need me to...

692
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:13,743
- Please, you don't have to...
...suicide you.

693
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:18,338
What did you say to Witwicky?

694
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:21,041
Shit!

695
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:24,927
Who wants some chick en dinner now,
bitch?

696
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:28,178
'Cause somebody messed
with the wrong Wang today!

697
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:31,727
Come on! You want some of me?

698
00:43:43,283 --> 00:43:46,696
I don't need any more didactic lectures
from Chuck.

699
00:43:46,788 --> 00:43:47,868
Jesus!

700
00:43:53,461 --> 00:43:54,871
Get legal.

701
00:43:56,673 --> 00:43:58,004
That's Jerry!

702
00:43:58,091 --> 00:44:00,377
Come on, people.
Yes, a workmate died,

703
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:02,629
but looking out the window
is not going to bring him back.

704
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,880
The man was depressed.

705
00:44:03,972 --> 00:44:05,007
Don't take a picture!

706
00:44:05,098 --> 00:44:07,339
You can keep watching him,
but he's not getting up.

707
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:09,924
You all read "Humpty Dumpty." Okay?

708
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:12,309
Witwicky.

709
00:44:12,397 --> 00:44:14,228
I'm spearheading the press.
You clean up.

710
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:18,149
Wang is everywhere. He is in the bistro.

711
00:44:18,236 --> 00:44:20,568
He's in the bamboo.
He's on the balustrade.

712
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,567
You see the sidewalk down there? Man!

713
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:26,695
Box up his personals.
Get his name off his parking space.

714
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:28,492
Hey, when did we get a new copier?

715
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,696
Listen, I'm not gonna say anything
about what I saw.

716
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:34,659
Who you share a toilet stall with
is totally your business.

717
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:37,495
This is exceedingly Japanese.

718
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,212
They never make it easy, do they?

719
00:45:19,882 --> 00:45:22,123
- What is with you?
- This is the real deal, Carly, okay?

720
00:45:22,218 --> 00:45:25,551
I need you to stay composed.
It's real life. I'll explain it to you later.

721
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:31,139
We've got an emergency.
You gotta get Colonel Lennox out here.

722
00:45:31,227 --> 00:45:32,808
I'm reporting a Decepticon.
The Decepticons are back.

723
00:45:32,895 --> 00:45:33,975
You gotta open that gate right now.

724
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,554
Easy, sir.
This is Health and Human Services.

725
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:38,139
Right. Packing M4s?

726
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:39,599
What are you protecting,
colostomy bags?

727
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:40,978
- Bedpans? Throat lozenges?
- Babe...

728
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,560
Where'd you get that hat from,
nursing school?

729
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:44,361
So, you're nurses
and foot-powder protectors? Fantastic.

730
00:45:44,448 --> 00:45:45,528
- Babe.
- Yes.

731
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:46,696
I don't think we're in the right place.

732
00:45:46,784 --> 00:45:47,773
We are in the right place.

733
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:49,904
We're in the right place
and I'm gonna talk to Optimus right now.

734
00:45:49,995 --> 00:45:50,950
- You're gonna get Optimus out here.
- Sir.

735
00:45:51,038 --> 00:45:52,027
Sir, you got the wrong building.

736
00:45:52,122 --> 00:45:53,111
I don't know what you're talking about.

737
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:54,913
What part of "Decepticons are back"
do you not understand?

738
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,582
Yo! You being a smartass?

739
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,662
Do not hit my car! It's a collector's item!

740
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:02,003
I wouldn't do that.

741
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:03,331
You're crazy!

742
00:46:05,844 --> 00:46:06,959
We got an Energon reading!

743
00:46:07,054 --> 00:46:08,590
We've got aliens in the vehicle!

744
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:11,844
You move, you're dead! Out! Out!

745
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:13,799
Got aliens in the vehicle!

746
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:17,261
- Freeze! Get out!
- We're freezing!

747
00:46:17,356 --> 00:46:18,937
Are you...

748
00:46:19,024 --> 00:46:20,355
Are you kidding me?

749
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:22,023
Sam, they've got guns!

750
00:46:24,113 --> 00:46:27,196
- I got him. Go!
- Bee! Is Bee in there?

751
00:46:28,325 --> 00:46:29,940
Okay, all right!

752
00:46:30,035 --> 00:46:32,572
This how you treat Autobots?
We're on the same team.

753
00:46:32,663 --> 00:46:35,245
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-Eleven,
dickhead.

754
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,163
- That's right.
- A-hole.

755
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:38,991
How's your car now?

756
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,423
That's my car.

757
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:51,929
Come here.

758
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,006
Come here!

759
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,092
Come on. Sam.

760
00:46:55,186 --> 00:46:56,392
What is your deal?

761
00:46:56,938 --> 00:46:58,178
I know your black ops stuff
is important to you.

762
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,559
I'm not trying to diminish it
or guilt-trip you or anything,

763
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,140
I just never see you anymore.

764
00:47:02,235 --> 00:47:04,567
You can't come to the garage
and just hang out one night?

765
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:06,770
Sam. That makes me feel bad.

766
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:08,396
I hope you feel bad.
You should feel bad.

767
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:11,198
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.
I feel bad every single day.

768
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,618
Yo, let's go, both of you.
Lennox wants to see you.

769
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,070
What, we not good enough
for you anymore?

770
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,532
I'm sorry, babe.
They were very rude, all right?

771
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:21,584
And you're fixing my car.
You don't think so?

772
00:47:21,963 --> 00:47:23,919
Raise your hand if you had
a flying psycho-ninja copier

773
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:24,996
trying to kill you today!

774
00:47:25,091 --> 00:47:26,171
Those are my brass knuckles.

775
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:28,170
That's my anklet.
Do I have to take that off, too?

776
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:29,296
And my toe rings?

777
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,257
<i>All NEST officials clear the floor.</i>

778
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,430
<i>We have 10 minutes
until attempted contact.</i>

779
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:35,798
We've taken possession
of the five devices

780
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,601
that were hidden in the ship
with Sentinel Prime.

781
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:41,350
They're some kind of
prototype Autobot technology.

782
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,858
They say Sentinel
was the Einstein of his civilization,

783
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:46,150
so we're gonna keep these locked up

784
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,107
until we know what we're dealing with.

785
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,486
Right now, no one gets access. No one.

786
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:54,693
This Wang guy recognized me.
He told me to warn you.

787
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,994
He was talking
about the dark side of the moon,

788
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,116
- then they killed him.
- Wait a minute.

789
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,243
- He mentioned the moon?
- Yeah, dark side of the moon.

790
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,916
But why would Decepticons
want to kill humans?

791
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:04,039
I thought their war was
with the Autobots.

792
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,291
And that is when he made his first
quick-look science report.

793
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,044
That's what we want...

794
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,295
Who's the chick? Okay.

795
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,343
Excuse me! Colonel Lennox?

796
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,842
Director Mearing,
this is Sam Witwicky...

797
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:17,050
I know his name, Colonel.
I wanna know who gave him clearance?

798
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,680
Who gave me clearance?
How about Optimus Prime,

799
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,477
when he touched down in suburbia
looking for my house?

800
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,889
This is the
National Intelligence Director.

801
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,189
In case you...

802
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,272
- H i.
- Disrespecting a federal officer?

803
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,819
Maybe that'll get you somewhere.
Who's she?

804
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,112
She's my girlfriend.

805
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,776
What is this, like, a date?

806
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,487
She knows all about the Autobots, okay?
She knows Bumblebee.

807
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,035
And she comes from a military family.
I can vouch for her.

808
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,785
Hey, I have an idea. How about
we get back to the important topics,

809
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,242
like the fact that I almost had
my face cut off by a Decepticon?

810
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,919
As a taxpayer, I'd like to lodge
a complaint, as a matter of fact.

811
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,086
Okay, listen, all right?

812
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:48,210
One of the software engineers
at Sam's office was murdered today.

813
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,041
He was involved in NASA's
lunar mapping probe.

814
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,336
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.

815
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:55,464
We cannot entrust national security
to teenagers

816
00:48:55,851 --> 00:49:00,185
unless I missed a policy paper.
Are we doing that now? No. Good.

817
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,936
I don't care who you are.

818
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:05,812
If you breathe a word of what you
see in here, you will do time for treason.

819
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:06,937
Do you understand me?

820
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:10,396
I'll take my orders from the Autobots.
I know them. I don't know you.

821
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,568
You will.

822
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:16,034
Sentinel Prime.

823
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:19,533
These things run on Energon,
and he's out of it. He's in a

824
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,031
sort of a sleep mode.

825
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:22,915
Let us begin.

826
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:33,589
That's the great Matrix of Leadership.

827
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,724
He holds the only thing in the universe
that can repower a Transformer's spark.

828
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:41,390
This is incredible.

829
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,726
Sentinel Prime,

830
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:47,225
we bid you return.

831
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:58,194
Hold your fire!

832
00:49:58,289 --> 00:49:59,995
Stop! Sentinel!

833
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:03,954
It is I, Optimus Prime!

834
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,911
It is all right. You are safe.

835
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,081
There is nothing to fear.

836
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,210
We are here.

837
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,549
You are home, Sentinel.

838
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,555
The war... The war!

839
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:25,936
The war was lost.

840
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:29,399
Cybertron is now
but a barren wasteland.

841
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:32,648
We have taken refuge here,
on planet Earth.

842
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,275
Its human race is our ally.

843
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:38,359
My ship. We came under fire.

844
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:41,695
The pillars. Where are the pillars?

845
00:50:42,374 --> 00:50:45,992
You saved five of them,
including the control pillar.

846
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:47,371
Only five?

847
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:49,877
We once had hundreds!

848
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:51,171
Excuse me, gentlemen.

849
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:54,045
May I ask, what is this technology
you're looking for?

850
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:56,968
It is the ability to reshape the universe.

851
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:59,671
Together the pillars
form a space bridge.

852
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:03,513
I designed, and I alone, can control it.

853
00:51:03,604 --> 00:51:05,560
It defies your laws of physics

854
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:08,264
to transport matter
through time and space.

855
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:11,351
You're talking
about a teleportation device, aren't you?

856
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:14,232
Yes, for resources, for refugees.

857
00:51:14,323 --> 00:51:18,236
Refugees, or troops of soldiers,
weapons, maybe bombs!

858
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:21,160
A means of an instant strike!
That's its military function, isn't it?

859
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:25,411
It is our technology
and it must be returned.

860
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:27,913
Yes. If humans say so.

861
00:51:28,004 --> 00:51:31,963
You can't just bring weapons of
mass destruction into our atmosphere!

862
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:33,459
You kind of have to clear customs first!

863
00:51:33,551 --> 00:51:37,009
A little formality called paperwork
kind of separates us from the animals.

864
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:40,596
I will overlook your condescending tone

865
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:43,299
if you heed the gravity of mine.

866
00:51:43,394 --> 00:51:46,682
The Decepticons must never know
the space bridge is here.

867
00:51:46,814 --> 00:51:47,929
For in their hands,

868
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:52,108
it would mean the end of your world.

869
00:51:53,404 --> 00:51:54,689
"Total Nightmare" file.

870
00:51:55,698 --> 00:51:58,610
So, the investigation is open.
We've sent agents to your office.

871
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:01,317
And, for the time being, we're gonna
send you home with Autobot protection.

872
00:52:02,204 --> 00:52:03,569
Who do I need to speak to

873
00:52:03,664 --> 00:52:06,622
to get you guys to understand
that I can help, that I can contribute?

874
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:07,949
Hey, we can all help.
Want to tell you what I know?

875
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:10,706
I could tell you about the solar system,
all the fun planets to hang out in.

876
00:52:10,796 --> 00:52:11,785
Get off my desk, please.

877
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:14,588
You pulling out guns?
I can't help you out now. She angry.

878
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:15,755
Oh, my God.

879
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:17,458
What do you envision for me?
I go home now?

880
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:19,544
I go back to work? I make copies?
I mean...

881
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:21,880
This is a unit
for veteran intelligence officers

882
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:23,464
and Special Forces,

883
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,720
not for boys
who once owned special cars.

884
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:27,392
That's a bit harsh, isn't it, ma'am?

885
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:29,011
Don't call me ma'am. I'm not a ma'am.

886
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:30,596
Well, you're a woman, aren't you?

887
00:52:31,526 --> 00:52:33,938
So, are those yours?

888
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:35,985
Yeah. CIA.

889
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:39,110
I only ask 'cause I also have a medal,
from the President.

890
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:42,485
Yeah. Great.
So, it's not that complicated, right?

891
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,161
No one gets to work with the Autobots
unless I approve it.

892
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:46,613
You're breaking my chain of command.

893
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,664
Come on, let's go.
You've done what you came for.

894
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:54,668
With all due respect, young man,
I appreciate what you did.

895
00:52:54,759 --> 00:52:55,919
But you're not a soldier.

896
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,750
You're a messenger.
You've always been a messenger.

897
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,628
He's a hero.

898
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:09,186
Bee, you take the freight elevator.
I'll see you up there.

899
00:53:13,444 --> 00:53:16,607
This blows.
That lady officially kicked us out.

900
00:53:16,698 --> 00:53:19,440
Yeah.
Witness Protection Program sucks.

901
00:53:19,534 --> 00:53:22,617
Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer
with big yellow and his cannons.

902
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:24,535
That dog can't protect crap.

903
00:53:26,124 --> 00:53:27,159
Bee?

904
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:34,795
You miss hanging out?

905
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,130
Yeah, me, too.

906
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:43,671
That woman,
she called me a messenger.

907
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:46,382
Can you believe that? After everything
I've done, I'm a messenger.

908
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:49,219
I believe it. I tell you, Sammy,
we feel the same way.

909
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:51,019
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

910
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,233
We should do something about it.

911
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:59,483
Bee, I need to know
why they're killing humans.

912
00:53:59,575 --> 00:54:01,566
I say we call in the expert.

913
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,447
<i>My next guest is a former
American intelligence operative</i>

914
00:54:04,538 --> 00:54:06,403
<i>who has dared to speak out</i>

915
00:54:06,498 --> 00:54:10,207
<i>regarding our alleged military alliance
with what many describe</i>

916
00:54:10,294 --> 00:54:13,457
<i>as a group
of extraterrestrial mercenaries.</i>

917
00:54:13,547 --> 00:54:17,881
<i>He is the author of the bestselling book,
Code-Name Hero.</i>

918
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,091
<i>Former special agent,
Seymour Simmons.</i>

919
00:54:20,179 --> 00:54:22,670
Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.

920
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:24,630
<i>Now, Agent Simmons,
you would have us believe</i>

921
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:26,465
<i>that it is in our best interest</i>

922
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,144
<i>to formally take sides
in this so-called alien civil war?</i>

923
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,767
Well, the other side wanted to
spank us for breakfast,

924
00:54:32,858 --> 00:54:35,224
so I wouldn't exactly call it a toss-up.

925
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:37,105
These Decepticons are lethal.

926
00:54:37,196 --> 00:54:39,938
<i>But polls show
half the world would feel safer</i>

927
00:54:40,032 --> 00:54:41,772
<i>with the Autobots completely gone.</i>

928
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:44,574
<i>Get them out of here!
We don't need them here!</i>

929
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:46,777
<i>I feel safer when I sleep
with a hand grenade.</i>

930
00:54:46,872 --> 00:54:48,237
<i>Doesn't mean I'm always right.</i>

931
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:51,039
<i>Now, agent, here at The Factor
we have obtained documents</i>

932
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:53,492
<i>that show you were fired....</i>

933
00:54:53,587 --> 00:54:55,748
- Chaz, I'm doing an interview.
- Sorry, Mr. Simmons.

934
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:56,954
Downsized, Bill.

935
00:54:57,049 --> 00:54:58,664
<i>- Budget cuts. Chaz, out.
- Your psych evaluation reports</i>

936
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:01,466
<i>"severe delusional tendencies."</i>

937
00:55:01,553 --> 00:55:02,713
This is ambush journalism.

938
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:04,716
<i>You want the truth
about the alien alliance?</i>

939
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:08,641
<i>Buy my book! Buy my book,
before it's too late, people!</i>

940
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:09,967
<i>You want a piece of me, Bill?</i>

941
00:55:10,062 --> 00:55:11,427
<i>- You want to get naked? I'm ready!
- Wow.</i>

942
00:55:11,522 --> 00:55:14,389
<i>- Interview is over! You, out of my house.
- You're sounding like a pinhead, agent.</i>

943
00:55:14,483 --> 00:55:16,223
<i>- And I've got a suggestion for you.
- It's over. Understand?</i>

944
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:17,524
<i>- Damage control.
- Dutch!</i>

945
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:19,522
You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons!

946
00:55:19,613 --> 00:55:21,820
You have 23 seconds
to leave the property.

947
00:55:21,907 --> 00:55:23,317
I have called the police!

948
00:55:23,408 --> 00:55:25,899
<i>You are peasant people
throwing rocks at a giant!</i>

949
00:55:25,994 --> 00:55:27,234
What's up next? What have we got?

950
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:28,656
Book signing, Midtown, noon.

951
00:55:28,747 --> 00:55:30,829
Then we pitch your reality show
to the Discovery Channel.

952
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:34,120
And I have this Witwicky
who keeps calling me.

953
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:35,246
Five times today.

954
00:55:35,337 --> 00:55:36,497
Kid? What does he want?

955
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:38,044
I called you
because the Decepticons are back.

956
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:39,496
I want to know why,
and I need your help.

957
00:55:39,591 --> 00:55:41,832
They're back?

958
00:55:41,927 --> 00:55:43,337
Well, that's good for business.

959
00:55:43,428 --> 00:55:45,339
What if I told you
I know a 50-year-old alien secret

960
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,636
that nobody ever told you.

961
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:52,093
Do not tempt my addiction.
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

962
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:54,971
- Dutch, is this line secure?
- No.

963
00:55:57,484 --> 00:56:00,521
Don't take the risk.
I'm rich, why should I?

964
00:56:00,612 --> 00:56:02,978
Do not relapse. I won't.

965
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:06,023
Do not let the demons win.

966
00:56:06,118 --> 00:56:07,233
Got it.

967
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:10,865
What kind of secret?

968
00:56:11,415 --> 00:56:14,122
Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up.

969
00:56:14,209 --> 00:56:16,325
Future tech. Assassinations.
That kind of stuff.

970
00:56:16,795 --> 00:56:18,535
Apollo.

971
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:20,958
Dutch!

972
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:30,798
Tell Megatron, "Let's tango."

973
00:56:41,737 --> 00:56:44,854
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

974
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:48,570
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

975
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,367
I've wondered what might have been

976
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:55,323
if you had fought the final battle,
instead of me.

977
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,542
Never mourn the past, young warrior.

978
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:02,623
Thanks to you, our race survives.

979
00:57:04,553 --> 00:57:07,090
You were our leader, Sentinel.

980
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:10,014
It is your right to lead us again.

981
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,386
In a world I do not know,

982
00:57:12,478 --> 00:57:17,438
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.
You are mine.

983
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,652
You've got to break this case down.

984
00:57:23,781 --> 00:57:25,692
What we have here
is an astronaut epidemic.

985
00:57:25,783 --> 00:57:29,241
MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident.
Killed. DOA. Car death.

986
00:57:29,328 --> 00:57:30,443
It's like these guys can't drive.

987
00:57:30,537 --> 00:57:32,573
They can fly into outer space,
but they can't drive a car.

988
00:57:33,332 --> 00:57:36,574
- Procured your information, Witwicky.
- Thank you, Bruce.

989
00:57:37,544 --> 00:57:38,875
Now,

990
00:57:40,881 --> 00:57:42,712
let me see one right now. One time.

991
00:57:43,217 --> 00:57:44,332
- Quick.
- Very.

992
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:52,006
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

993
00:57:52,476 --> 00:57:54,637
It says NASA launched it in 2009.

994
00:57:55,229 --> 00:57:57,311
See, forensics show
Wang may have messed with the code,

995
00:57:57,398 --> 00:57:58,979
preventing it from mapping
the far side of the moon,

996
00:57:59,066 --> 00:58:00,306
which is also the dark side.

997
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:01,811
Fucking awesome.

998
00:58:01,902 --> 00:58:05,486
They infiltrate us, intimidate us,
coerce us to do their dirty work.

999
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:07,437
And once they're done,

1000
00:58:08,742 --> 00:58:10,278
a double-tap to the cerebellum.

1001
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:12,575
So humans are working
for the Decepticons.

1002
00:58:13,205 --> 00:58:15,241
I don't think
this is about the Decepticons

1003
00:58:15,332 --> 00:58:17,744
looking for something on the moon.

1004
00:58:18,585 --> 00:58:22,043
I think it's about something
they wanted to hide.

1005
00:58:22,674 --> 00:58:24,164
Come to Daddy.

1006
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:26,381
Come on, throw down.

1007
00:58:28,388 --> 00:58:30,424
Did you eat a lot of paint chips
when you were a kid?

1008
00:58:31,016 --> 00:58:32,051
He's a freak.

1009
00:58:32,934 --> 00:58:34,390
- Like it?
- Get back!

1010
00:58:37,564 --> 00:58:38,770
I'm ticklish!

1011
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:44,355
Sir! We are having a pretty high-level
alien intel confab here

1012
00:58:44,446 --> 00:58:47,688
that I don't think you're cleared for,
errand boy.

1013
00:58:47,782 --> 00:58:48,817
Yeah, you're right.

1014
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:51,320
- It's a bitching robot.
- I think it's time to go, Bruce.

1015
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:53,948
- Thank you so much for this. And...
- Got to go, Bruce.

1016
00:58:56,124 --> 00:58:59,537
I'm smoking over here. Downloading
missing Russian cosmonauts.

1017
00:59:00,086 --> 00:59:02,498
Turns out the Soviets canceled
a manned mission to the moon.

1018
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:04,462
The moon, in 1972.

1019
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:06,915
And two of their cosmonauts
went into hiding in America.

1020
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,716
And I just found them alive.

1021
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:10,009
You're a genius, Brains.

1022
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:17,350
That was smooth, Bumblebee.

1023
00:59:20,732 --> 00:59:22,643
Missed it by that much.

1024
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:26,810
Hi.

1025
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:29,270
Would somebody care to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1026
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:31,447
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1027
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:34,071
Who am I? Who is that?
Dutch! Frisk her!

1028
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:35,572
Certainly.

1029
00:59:35,663 --> 00:59:37,745
No. Dutch.

1030
00:59:37,832 --> 00:59:39,072
Don't touch me.

1031
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:40,703
- I'm not gonna touch her.
- Sam?

1032
00:59:41,252 --> 00:59:42,583
Angel.

1033
00:59:43,963 --> 00:59:45,954
I was working. I'm sorry about this.

1034
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,586
- Great. We're homeless.
- She lives here? Wow.

1035
00:59:49,095 --> 00:59:50,881
You had your chance to frisk her.

1036
00:59:50,971 --> 00:59:53,963
- I have a girlfriend.
- Really? What's her name?

1037
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:55,218
India.

1038
00:59:56,685 --> 00:59:58,641
We're supposed to be
at Dylan's party, remember?

1039
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:00,185
I do remember,
but these are my friends.

1040
01:00:00,272 --> 01:00:01,728
They need me.
I have to be here right now.

1041
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:05,104
So, what, the Autobots and the military,
they can't handle this on their own?

1042
01:00:05,194 --> 01:00:07,435
You know what I liked
about your war stories, Sam?

1043
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,612
It's that they were stories,
they were in the past.

1044
01:00:09,698 --> 01:00:11,438
<i>Look, I know you're thinking
about your brother, okay?</i>

1045
01:00:11,534 --> 01:00:14,116
And you're thinking about your family.
And it's not that situation.

1046
01:00:14,203 --> 01:00:15,192
- No?
- No.

1047
01:00:15,287 --> 01:00:18,029
Why not? Why isn't it, Sam?

1048
01:00:18,124 --> 01:00:21,082
You think we'd rather have his medals,
or we'd rather have him?

1049
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:26,003
I hear you. I get it.
Where are you taking my bunny? Stop!

1050
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,421
Just stop for a second.

1051
01:00:27,508 --> 01:00:28,964
You think I could sleep last night?

1052
01:00:29,051 --> 01:00:31,337
And then it hit me.
No, Sam wants to be in danger.

1053
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:34,010
- He doesn't know who he is without it.
- I just want to matter.

1054
01:00:35,182 --> 01:00:36,797
You matter to me.

1055
01:00:43,064 --> 01:00:44,304
I know you're worried.
I know you're worried.

1056
01:00:44,399 --> 01:00:46,481
But I promise you, I can handle this.

1057
01:00:47,235 --> 01:00:48,816
Can you? You can promise it?

1058
01:00:48,903 --> 01:00:50,234
I promise.

1059
01:00:51,739 --> 01:00:54,902
Sam, I don't want to lose you,
and I know where this leads.

1060
01:00:57,579 --> 01:00:59,535
I'm not ready for this.

1061
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,663
Are you coming with me?

1062
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,160
I can't.

1063
01:01:05,587 --> 01:01:06,667
Okay.

1064
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:13,508
Hey.

1065
01:01:17,684 --> 01:01:19,299
Here's your foot.

1066
01:01:30,363 --> 01:01:32,604
The warrior's path is a solitary one.

1067
01:01:33,783 --> 01:01:35,739
How the hell did she afford that car?

1068
01:01:35,827 --> 01:01:38,193
- Her boss.
- Rich bastards!

1069
01:01:38,288 --> 01:01:40,745
I used to hate them. Now, it's...

1070
01:01:42,626 --> 01:01:45,868
Going to a gig on the hunt
for two Russian cosmonauts.

1071
01:01:45,962 --> 01:01:48,078
Nothing like driving in a Maybach.

1072
01:01:48,173 --> 01:01:50,129
Germans know how to make cars,
let me tell you.

1073
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:56,010
My Dutchman,
former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire,

1074
01:01:56,097 --> 01:01:57,337
tracked them down here.

1075
01:01:58,975 --> 01:02:01,682
So, these cosmonauts
went into hiding. Why?

1076
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:03,135
Bingo. I got a match.

1077
01:02:04,481 --> 01:02:06,062
You're a German Shepherd, Dutch.

1078
01:02:06,149 --> 01:02:09,391
The thing about Russians is,
they never like to talk.

1079
01:02:09,486 --> 01:02:12,228
It's gonna take a little
of the "international language."

1080
01:02:17,786 --> 01:02:19,651
That means "good-bye."

1081
01:02:33,677 --> 01:02:35,087
Stay loose.

1082
01:02:35,762 --> 01:02:38,003
Dutch, give me something tough.

1083
01:02:40,892 --> 01:02:42,007
Baryshnikov.

1084
01:02:42,227 --> 01:02:43,387
We do speak English.

1085
01:02:43,688 --> 01:02:45,178
Dutch, you suck.

1086
01:02:46,023 --> 01:02:48,264
It's a Cyrillic alphabet.

1087
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:51,351
It's like all the buttons
you never push on a calculator!

1088
01:02:52,571 --> 01:02:53,731
I don't suck.

1089
01:02:53,823 --> 01:02:56,940
Agent Seymour Simmons,
Sector Eight, formerly Seven.

1090
01:02:57,034 --> 01:02:59,992
We know who you are, cosmonautchiks.

1091
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,114
So what?

1092
01:03:01,205 --> 01:03:04,163
You were supposed to travel
to the dark side of the moon,

1093
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,957
then it all got shut down.

1094
01:03:09,338 --> 01:03:11,750
The question is, why?

1095
01:03:16,637 --> 01:03:18,844
"Can my child smoke in here?"

1096
01:03:26,647 --> 01:03:27,853
Okay, all right. Okay.

1097
01:03:29,108 --> 01:03:30,143
Go ahead, shoot me.

1098
01:03:31,902 --> 01:03:33,642
I'm willing to die for my country.
Are you?

1099
01:03:35,031 --> 01:03:36,146
Really?

1100
01:03:36,907 --> 01:03:38,898
You are beautiful. Has anyone ever
told you you're beautiful?

1101
01:03:38,993 --> 01:03:40,153
She's a beautiful woman.

1102
01:03:44,915 --> 01:03:46,075
Hey!

1103
01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:51,247
Dutch! Back in the cage.

1104
01:03:52,423 --> 01:03:54,379
Dutch! Hold, Dutch, hold!

1105
01:03:54,759 --> 01:03:56,340
Control your boy, please.
Control your boy.

1106
01:03:56,427 --> 01:03:57,587
Dutch, stop!

1107
01:04:03,142 --> 01:04:05,383
I'm so sorry. That is the old me.

1108
01:04:05,478 --> 01:04:07,218
Okay, let's everybody just calm down!

1109
01:04:07,313 --> 01:04:10,771
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns.
Let's relax. World War II is over.

1110
01:04:13,862 --> 01:04:17,275
You are about to see
one of the biggest Soviet secrets.

1111
01:04:18,867 --> 01:04:21,199
America first to send man to the moon.

1112
01:04:21,286 --> 01:04:23,948
But USSR first to send camera.

1113
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:27,827
In 1959, our Luna 3

1114
01:04:27,918 --> 01:04:31,160
take picture of the dark,
the shadow side.

1115
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,628
Sees nothing.

1116
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,292
But in 1963, Luna 4 sees...

1117
01:04:38,387 --> 01:04:40,503
- Strange rocks.
- Yeah.

1118
01:04:40,597 --> 01:04:43,634
Around the ship. Hundreds of them.

1119
01:04:43,725 --> 01:04:45,465
Yeah, show picture.

1120
01:04:46,311 --> 01:04:49,223
With some drag marks.

1121
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:55,309
I've seen these.
These aren't rocks, these are pillars.

1122
01:04:55,821 --> 01:04:58,028
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

1123
01:04:58,115 --> 01:05:00,356
We know about them
because the Autobots have five of these.

1124
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:04,568
The Decepticons must have raided
the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there,

1125
01:05:04,663 --> 01:05:07,075
took the pillars, and hid them.

1126
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:08,200
It doesn't make sense.

1127
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:10,282
The Decepticons have the ship.
They have all those pillars.

1128
01:05:10,377 --> 01:05:11,457
Why would they leave Sentinel

1129
01:05:11,545 --> 01:05:13,376
when he's the only one
who can use them?

1130
01:05:13,922 --> 01:05:15,253
Unless...

1131
01:05:15,632 --> 01:05:17,588
He's the one thing they still need.

1132
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:20,884
We've got to meet up with Sentinel,
rendezvous with him and keep him safe.

1133
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,592
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel.
Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

1134
01:05:23,683 --> 01:05:24,798
We're coming to NEST now.

1135
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:29,051
Mr. Witwicky,
I thought I made it clear to you

1136
01:05:29,147 --> 01:05:30,637
that I did not want you
calling this phone.

1137
01:05:30,731 --> 01:05:33,438
<i>Listen, the whole thing has been
a setup since the beginning.</i>

1138
01:05:33,526 --> 01:05:35,642
The Decepticons wanted Optimus
to find Sentinel

1139
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:37,442
because only Optimus could revive him.

1140
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,270
But we have the space bridge.

1141
01:05:39,366 --> 01:05:42,608
Mearing, you have five pillars.
I just learned that they have hundreds.

1142
01:05:42,703 --> 01:05:43,988
<i>You're doing exactly
what they wanted you to do.</i>

1143
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,285
<i>What do you need me to say to you?</i>

1144
01:05:45,372 --> 01:05:47,863
The Decepticons are coming
for Sentinel Prime!

1145
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,121
We're going to NEST.

1146
01:05:54,005 --> 01:05:55,415
<i>We have an Energon alert.</i>

1147
01:05:55,506 --> 01:05:57,872
<i>Energon readings detected
on the D. C. Parkway.</i>

1148
01:05:59,177 --> 01:06:01,884
<i>Currently tracking
three black Suburbans.</i>

1149
01:06:36,214 --> 01:06:38,626
Bee, you got to get Sentinel
out of here! You got to guard him!

1150
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:49,924
<i>Oh, mein Gott! I'm fired!</i>

1151
01:06:54,524 --> 01:06:55,684
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

1152
01:07:13,043 --> 01:07:14,283
Got you!

1153
01:07:15,462 --> 01:07:17,418
Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bee!

1154
01:07:45,951 --> 01:07:47,907
Bee, you've got to move faster!
Faster, Bee! Go!

1155
01:07:51,582 --> 01:07:52,742
Bee!

1156
01:08:14,855 --> 01:08:15,970
All right, back to NEST!

1157
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:24,941
Dino, I got him!

1158
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:34,990
Ironhide!

1159
01:08:59,525 --> 01:09:01,356
Is there a problem?

1160
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:04,898
A little Mexican standoff we got here.

1161
01:09:05,365 --> 01:09:06,821
Weapons down.

1162
01:09:07,116 --> 01:09:09,949
And we'll let you escape
with your dignity.

1163
01:09:14,248 --> 01:09:15,533
Drop them.

1164
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:18,828
That's good.

1165
01:09:22,757 --> 01:09:24,543
Ironhide, watch out!

1166
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,755
Ironhide, catch!

1167
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,804
Behind you!

1168
01:09:42,236 --> 01:09:44,192
Decepticon punk!

1169
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:53,944
Class dismissed.

1170
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,582
- Get inside! Let's go!
- Move! Keep moving!

1171
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:04,877
- Lennox!
- Go, go, go!

1172
01:10:04,968 --> 01:10:06,083
We got Decepticons everywhere.

1173
01:10:06,177 --> 01:10:08,259
I've got my whole team deployed
looking for them. Ironhide!

1174
01:10:09,139 --> 01:10:10,879
Protect Sentinel!
Get him locked up inside!

1175
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:12,214
Consider it done!

1176
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,594
Hey, you've got to guard him,
'cause he's the key to the whole thing.

1177
01:10:14,686 --> 01:10:19,430
Indeed, I am. What you must realize,
my Autobot brothers,

1178
01:10:19,524 --> 01:10:22,140
is we were never going to win the war.

1179
01:10:22,694 --> 01:10:27,108
For the sake of our planet's survival,
a deal had to be made

1180
01:10:28,116 --> 01:10:29,606
with Megatron.

1181
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:39,328
- Get back!
- What have you done?

1182
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:43,711
I hereby discharge you from duty.

1183
01:10:49,804 --> 01:10:50,964
- Bee!
- Get back!

1184
01:11:06,153 --> 01:11:08,769
Rally all NEST forces back to the base!
Come on!

1185
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:09,853
No...

1186
01:11:18,582 --> 01:11:19,662
Get a medic down here!

1187
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,242
We don't have enough men!
Do not engage Sentinel!

1188
01:11:23,629 --> 01:11:24,869
Just go to the back gate.

1189
01:11:30,345 --> 01:11:31,710
Tak e cover!

1190
01:11:35,266 --> 01:11:36,506
Watch left! Watch left!

1191
01:11:36,851 --> 01:11:38,716
Let's go! Follow me!

1192
01:11:48,196 --> 01:11:50,107
- Director, don't go there!
- Stand down!

1193
01:11:50,198 --> 01:11:51,278
Hey, Sentinel!

1194
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,068
- Director!
- What is going on?

1195
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:54,444
What do you think you are doing?

1196
01:11:57,747 --> 01:11:59,738
I am a Prime!

1197
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:02,199
I do not take orders from you.

1198
01:12:03,545 --> 01:12:04,625
Director Mearing, come on.

1199
01:12:04,712 --> 01:12:06,498
We can't fight him. Let's go.
We have to go.

1200
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:10,047
Now return what belongs to me!

1201
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:13,584
Oh, my God!

1202
01:12:27,652 --> 01:12:29,984
- You guys okay?
- Is everybody out?

1203
01:12:30,321 --> 01:12:32,357
Everybody, stay calm.
You're gonna be fine.

1204
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:45,117
Yeah, take a look, Optimus!
This is all on you!

1205
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:47,202
Sentinel hit the vault! Took the pillars.

1206
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:52,541
Come on, let's go.
All right, notify the 101St Airborne!

1207
01:12:52,635 --> 01:12:54,967
We need to hunt this thing down!

1208
01:13:01,145 --> 01:13:02,305
Carly!

1209
01:13:05,441 --> 01:13:07,306
Hot from our little campfire.

1210
01:13:07,651 --> 01:13:09,437
S'mores. Isn't that great?

1211
01:13:09,653 --> 01:13:11,359
We're really living off the land.

1212
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,230
Mom, Dad, have you guys seen
Carly come home yet?

1213
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:16,482
Excuse me. Can you knock, please?
This is our bedroom.

1214
01:13:16,702 --> 01:13:17,691
Why wouldn't she be at home?

1215
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:20,782
We had a fight
and we might have broken up,

1216
01:13:20,873 --> 01:13:21,953
or be on a break. I don't really know.

1217
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:24,248
- What? No.
- Look, I can't talk about it right now.

1218
01:13:24,335 --> 01:13:26,576
I can't go into details, Mom.
I have to find her.

1219
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,628
Sit down. We're having
a family meeting. Family meeting!

1220
01:13:29,798 --> 01:13:30,913
You may not know this,

1221
01:13:31,008 --> 01:13:33,420
but your father and I
were not always this perfectly happy.

1222
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:34,920
You know, there was a time
in our marriage

1223
01:13:35,012 --> 01:13:36,673
when I thought
this was not gonna work out.

1224
01:13:36,931 --> 01:13:38,717
- Can we please not?
- She's damaging him.

1225
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:41,390
You break up with
one world-class hottie...

1226
01:13:41,478 --> 01:13:42,968
No. Stop. Stop, okay? She dumped me,

1227
01:13:43,063 --> 01:13:45,054
I moved on to something better.
That's it. I'm a happier person.

1228
01:13:45,148 --> 01:13:46,137
The second beautiful girl,
and you lose her.

1229
01:13:46,232 --> 01:13:47,221
Why don't you help me?

1230
01:13:47,525 --> 01:13:49,641
- They had an argument.
- One fight.

1231
01:13:49,736 --> 01:13:52,603
You're not gonna get a third one,
I mean, unless you have like a big...

1232
01:13:52,697 --> 01:13:53,937
What the... Ma!

1233
01:13:54,032 --> 01:13:56,444
Maybe you just don't know
what you're doing.

1234
01:13:56,534 --> 01:13:58,616
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.
- You need the book.

1235
01:13:58,703 --> 01:14:00,739
- Tell him about the book.
- You're always wrong. Get used to it.

1236
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:02,616
<i>Okay. You've gotta read this.
She Comes First.</i>

1237
01:14:02,707 --> 01:14:04,743
- There's some killer shit in here.
- No. No.

1238
01:14:04,834 --> 01:14:07,291
- That's it, I'm going.
- No! No!

1239
01:14:07,545 --> 01:14:09,957
Sit down, sit down! Back me up!

1240
01:14:10,548 --> 01:14:12,755
- Happy wife, happy life.
- Heck yeah.

1241
01:14:12,842 --> 01:14:16,300
Unhappy wife, stone-cold misery
for the rest of your...

1242
01:14:16,388 --> 01:14:17,628
- Stop.
- It's true.

1243
01:14:17,847 --> 01:14:19,883
All I'm saying is, do you love this girl?

1244
01:14:20,392 --> 01:14:22,553
- She's the one.
- Then you gotta go get her.

1245
01:14:22,769 --> 01:14:24,930
I mean, your dad and I,
when we had troubles,

1246
01:14:25,022 --> 01:14:27,684
he moved heaven and earth to find me.

1247
01:14:27,775 --> 01:14:30,357
Say what you said. Say it.

1248
01:14:30,444 --> 01:14:33,060
"I will follow you to the end of time."

1249
01:14:33,572 --> 01:14:34,652
Does that suck or what?

1250
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,651
- It's like a bad sci-fi film.
- No. It is so sweet.

1251
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:40,113
I want you to get out of the city. You get
as far away from here as you can.

1252
01:14:40,454 --> 01:14:41,443
You understand?

1253
01:14:41,789 --> 01:14:42,778
I love you.

1254
01:15:03,019 --> 01:15:06,386
My master! Such a brilliant scheme!

1255
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,644
So when Sentinel left Cybertron,
it was to defect?

1256
01:15:10,943 --> 01:15:14,435
He was meant to rendezvous
with me here on Earth

1257
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:16,771
before fate waylaid us both.

1258
01:15:17,074 --> 01:15:19,656
The only way to revive him,

1259
01:15:19,744 --> 01:15:22,611
we needed Prime and his Matrix.

1260
01:15:22,788 --> 01:15:24,779
Excellent strategy.

1261
01:15:33,966 --> 01:15:35,831
Mine, mine!

1262
01:15:37,053 --> 01:15:39,795
So he is now your partner, master?

1263
01:15:40,014 --> 01:15:43,472
He is my greatest triumph.

1264
01:15:43,559 --> 01:15:44,844
So impressive.

1265
01:15:45,186 --> 01:15:47,427
Commencing transport.

1266
01:15:47,563 --> 01:15:50,350
Stop! No! No, Sentinel!

1267
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:51,897
Forgive me.

1268
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:57,862
Here we are.

1269
01:15:57,949 --> 01:15:59,814
Fight us now.

1270
01:16:38,864 --> 01:16:39,853
Contact!

1271
01:16:39,949 --> 01:16:41,985
Watch out! Move it! Move it!

1272
01:16:45,204 --> 01:16:47,365
Autobots, retreat!

1273
01:17:14,525 --> 01:17:16,061
Why, Sentinel, why?

1274
01:17:16,527 --> 01:17:19,189
For Cybertron! For our home!

1275
01:17:19,656 --> 01:17:24,821
What war destroyed, we can rebuild!
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

1276
01:17:24,911 --> 01:17:29,996
No, it's not the only way. This is our
home! We must defend the humans!

1277
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:32,449
So lost you are, Optimus.

1278
01:17:32,544 --> 01:17:34,580
On Cybertron, we were gods.

1279
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:38,163
And here, they call us machines.

1280
01:17:38,258 --> 01:17:41,967
Let the humans serve us, or perish.

1281
01:17:44,556 --> 01:17:49,266
You're lucky I didn't kill you.
In time you'll see.

1282
01:17:50,438 --> 01:17:52,429
It's not over.

1283
01:17:55,109 --> 01:17:59,273
Now, if I were him, I wouldn't let you
out of my sight for one second.

1284
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:03,439
It's funny. I was just thinking
on the way over here,

1285
01:18:03,534 --> 01:18:05,570
I could really use some advice
from Dylan, and there he is.

1286
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:07,197
- Can I speak to you, Carly?
- Welcome. Please, sit down.

1287
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:08,403
Have a drink.

1288
01:18:08,789 --> 01:18:11,747
You know what, I don't need a drink.
Or a car, or a job.

1289
01:18:11,834 --> 01:18:13,244
I just need to speak
to my girlfriend alone.

1290
01:18:13,336 --> 01:18:14,621
Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

1291
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:18,124
Excuse me.

1292
01:18:20,843 --> 01:18:23,175
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you outside.

1293
01:18:23,804 --> 01:18:25,465
I really think I can help you, Sam.

1294
01:18:25,556 --> 01:18:28,138
I remember a talk I had
with my dad once about tough choices.

1295
01:18:28,226 --> 01:18:30,057
Yeah, now's not the time.
We'll set something up, though.

1296
01:18:30,144 --> 01:18:32,385
Of course, it was way back,
when my dad's firm was in charge

1297
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,187
of budget review
and accounting for NASA.

1298
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:37,895
You see,
the thing that he taught me was,

1299
01:18:37,985 --> 01:18:41,148
when it's not your war,
you join the side that's going to win.

1300
01:18:43,115 --> 01:18:44,104
Move.

1301
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,656
Too direct? Or is it just me?

1302
01:18:45,744 --> 01:18:46,779
Certainly not you, sir.

1303
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:01,874
You're mine!

1304
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:03,671
No!

1305
01:19:06,807 --> 01:19:08,638
- Get help!
- Sam, I can't get out!

1306
01:19:09,184 --> 01:19:10,173
- Someone get help!
- Good night!

1307
01:19:10,269 --> 01:19:11,304
Good night, Mr. Dylan.

1308
01:19:11,395 --> 01:19:13,386
Get me out of here!

1309
01:19:16,775 --> 01:19:19,107
Help! Get help!

1310
01:19:19,194 --> 01:19:22,186
- He's young. He will learn. Good night.
- Get me out!

1311
01:19:22,322 --> 01:19:23,528
It was a fun night.

1312
01:19:24,032 --> 01:19:28,321
You really think you're the first man ever
asked to join the noble alien cause?

1313
01:19:28,412 --> 01:19:29,743
Who are you?

1314
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:32,913
Do you know why we've not been back
to the moon since 1972?

1315
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:34,823
Because these two,

1316
01:19:34,918 --> 01:19:37,955
they came to my dad and they told him
to do some creative accounting.

1317
01:19:38,046 --> 01:19:40,628
Make it way too expensive
to ever go back. So, he and the others

1318
01:19:40,716 --> 01:19:43,048
shut down the American
and Russian space programs.

1319
01:19:43,135 --> 01:19:45,126
And they've been our clients ever since.

1320
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,882
- You helped them kill people?
- You think they'd give you a choice?

1321
01:19:48,015 --> 01:19:49,676
Besides, it's not
like I personally participated.

1322
01:19:49,891 --> 01:19:51,802
I am a liaison. I liaise.

1323
01:19:55,397 --> 01:19:56,728
It's hostile takeover time, Sam.

1324
01:19:59,318 --> 01:20:00,558
Sam!

1325
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:05,612
- Sam!
- Let her go!

1326
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:07,860
Sam!

1327
01:20:10,912 --> 01:20:12,903
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.

1328
01:20:13,082 --> 01:20:15,038
You're the one spy
I've never been able to provide

1329
01:20:15,126 --> 01:20:16,582
as someone close to the Autobots.

1330
01:20:20,089 --> 01:20:22,250
Sam! Don't do what he wants!

1331
01:20:22,342 --> 01:20:23,957
Yes, he will.

1332
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,087
They all do.

1333
01:20:27,847 --> 01:20:29,587
They will slaughter her,
you understand me?

1334
01:20:29,682 --> 01:20:33,220
In the time it takes you to blink,
they'll do it to her and they'll do it to me.

1335
01:20:33,311 --> 01:20:35,097
So you show a little respect

1336
01:20:35,188 --> 01:20:37,429
when someone offers you a job!

1337
01:20:38,775 --> 01:20:40,060
Wrist.

1338
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:42,316
You are to track down Optimus Prime,

1339
01:20:42,403 --> 01:20:44,268
because you're the one human
he trusts,

1340
01:20:44,364 --> 01:20:45,900
and you will ask one question.

1341
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:50,029
How does he intend to fight back?
Strategies, tactics, everything!

1342
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:58,207
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it?
It's very high-tech.

1343
01:20:58,294 --> 01:21:00,831
It lets us see what you see,
hear what you hear

1344
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:02,253
and it taps your nervous system.

1345
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,706
So, if you so much as try and signal...

1346
01:21:07,053 --> 01:21:08,634
I don't know what to tell you, Sam.

1347
01:21:08,721 --> 01:21:11,758
Relationships have consequences.
I am here because of my father.

1348
01:21:11,849 --> 01:21:13,259
She is here because of you.

1349
01:21:15,812 --> 01:21:18,144
Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!

1350
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:20,013
Soundwave, would you please?

1351
01:21:24,404 --> 01:21:26,235
Sam, do your job.

1352
01:21:26,656 --> 01:21:29,147
She'll be safe. I give you my word.

1353
01:21:31,868 --> 01:21:34,484
I'll kill you. You have my word.

1354
01:21:37,332 --> 01:21:40,495
<i>Combatant Commands
are now at DEFCON 1.</i>

1355
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:43,332
Approximately 200 Decepticons
are now in hiding.

1356
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:45,288
Energon detectors have been triggered

1357
01:21:45,383 --> 01:21:47,544
as far away
as South America and China.

1358
01:21:47,927 --> 01:21:50,669
The U. N. Just received
an encrypted audio file.

1359
01:21:50,763 --> 01:21:53,505
They say it's from the leader
of the Autobots.

1360
01:21:53,599 --> 01:21:55,180
<i>Defenders of Earth.</i>

1361
01:21:55,268 --> 01:21:57,930
<i>We have come
for your natural resources</i>

1362
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,136
<i>to rebuild our damaged planet.</i>

1363
01:22:01,108 --> 01:22:03,190
<i>When we have transported all we need,</i>

1364
01:22:03,277 --> 01:22:06,314
<i>we will leave your world in peace.</i>

1365
01:22:06,405 --> 01:22:08,316
<i>For such peace to exist,</i>

1366
01:22:08,407 --> 01:22:13,151
<i>you must immediately exile
the Autobot rebels you have harbored.</i>

1367
01:22:14,037 --> 01:22:15,527
<i>Nonnegotiable.</i>

1368
01:22:16,039 --> 01:22:17,529
<i>Renounce the rebels.</i>

1369
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:20,495
<i>We await your reply.</i>

1370
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:22,792
We'll debrief you in transit.

1371
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,290
Yeah, I really don't see
how I can be of any help.

1372
01:22:24,381 --> 01:22:25,461
I mean, you guys seem pretty busy.

1373
01:22:25,549 --> 01:22:27,380
We could just do this another time,
I think.

1374
01:22:30,888 --> 01:22:33,049
I have underestimated you at every turn.

1375
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:34,380
What?

1376
01:22:34,475 --> 01:22:36,306
You warned us
that they were using humans.

1377
01:22:36,393 --> 01:22:38,054
And you knew that Sentinel was the key.

1378
01:22:38,145 --> 01:22:39,351
Director!

1379
01:22:40,105 --> 01:22:43,063
Who am I? Hey, you're the expert.
I'm just a walking security risk.

1380
01:22:49,281 --> 01:22:50,441
Are you all right?

1381
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:53,524
Yes.

1382
01:22:53,827 --> 01:22:55,988
- No, you're not. You're sweating.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1383
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:57,194
I'm sweating because I'm nervous.

1384
01:22:57,289 --> 01:22:59,371
I'm nervous because you got me
in here with this information.

1385
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:00,743
Okay, I'm a Twitter junkie.
I blog everything.

1386
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:02,574
- I can't keep a secret to save my life.
- You wouldn't dare.

1387
01:23:02,669 --> 01:23:05,411
- That's the truth. I'm telling you.
- Director, the Pentagon's calling in 15.

1388
01:23:07,257 --> 01:23:08,747
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

1389
01:23:10,303 --> 01:23:11,509
Get away from me.

1390
01:23:11,596 --> 01:23:14,429
<i>It's been a remarkable series of events
today at the Capitol.</i>

1391
01:23:14,516 --> 01:23:16,552
<i>Just moments ago,
legislation was passed</i>

1392
01:23:16,643 --> 01:23:18,099
<i>to exile the Autobots</i>

1393
01:23:18,186 --> 01:23:19,517
<i>from American shores.</i>

1394
01:23:19,604 --> 01:23:22,892
<i>The U. S. Military alliance with them
is officially over.</i>

1395
01:23:22,982 --> 01:23:24,722
<i>In the words
of the House Majority Leader,</i>

1396
01:23:24,817 --> 01:23:26,557
<i>the sponsor of today's resolution,</i>

1397
01:23:26,653 --> 01:23:27,813
<i>- "We cannot in good conscience.... "
- Okay.</i>

1398
01:23:27,904 --> 01:23:29,610
What? They can't do this.

1399
01:23:29,697 --> 01:23:32,655
- You gotta tell them. They can't do that.
- Okay. It's official. It's a go, people.

1400
01:23:32,742 --> 01:23:35,028
These are our allies. The Autobots
fought for us. They fought with us.

1401
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:36,154
And where are we now?

1402
01:23:36,246 --> 01:23:37,782
Facing an enemy invasion

1403
01:23:37,872 --> 01:23:40,534
with an enemy that has the means
to deploy countless more.

1404
01:23:44,087 --> 01:23:45,543
If there is any more you know,

1405
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:48,121
anything at all
about the enemy's intentions,

1406
01:23:49,509 --> 01:23:50,794
now is the time to tell.

1407
01:23:52,136 --> 01:23:53,967
Autobots have no way
of leaving this planet.

1408
01:23:54,472 --> 01:23:55,962
And that is where you're wrong.

1409
01:23:57,016 --> 01:23:59,007
<i>Its name is the Xanthium.</i>

1410
01:23:59,644 --> 01:24:01,054
<i>It brought the second wave of Autobots</i>

1411
01:24:01,145 --> 01:24:03,636
<i>and it's been under NASA 's care
and study ever since.</i>

1412
01:24:04,482 --> 01:24:06,222
<i>We linked it
with a decommissioned shuttle</i>

1413
01:24:06,317 --> 01:24:08,979
<i>to maintain military control
until they're gone.</i>

1414
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:13,188
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque
on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not 19!

1415
01:24:13,283 --> 01:24:15,649
You're gonna risk the lives
of all me mates! I'll ball you!

1416
01:24:16,536 --> 01:24:19,243
<i>These guys are the Wreck ers.
They take care of the Xanthium.</i>

1417
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:21,412
We don't let them off the base much,
'cause they're assholes.

1418
01:24:21,499 --> 01:24:23,535
You gotta pull that, ya nancy swanker!

1419
01:24:23,626 --> 01:24:25,082
It's time to kill him!

1420
01:24:25,169 --> 01:24:27,080
I'm just trying to help, you know.
Just doing my job.

1421
01:24:27,171 --> 01:24:29,628
Just calm down. Leave him alone.
This is a human being.

1422
01:24:29,716 --> 01:24:31,798
- Epps!
- You are ridiculous!

1423
01:24:31,884 --> 01:24:33,124
- Is that you?
- What up, man?

1424
01:24:33,219 --> 01:24:35,005
What are you doing here?

1425
01:24:35,096 --> 01:24:36,677
I retired from the Air Force.

1426
01:24:37,182 --> 01:24:38,513
Can you let my hand go?

1427
01:24:39,727 --> 01:24:41,058
What the hell was that?

1428
01:24:41,353 --> 01:24:43,435
Now I just consult
to run interference for them.

1429
01:24:43,522 --> 01:24:44,762
Well, you're not helping!

1430
01:24:44,857 --> 01:24:48,145
No more combat and aliens shooting
at my ass. I got a dream job.

1431
01:24:48,235 --> 01:24:50,146
Time to get off this planet.

1432
01:24:50,237 --> 01:24:53,604
Kicking the Autobots out.
Can you believe this is happening?

1433
01:24:54,491 --> 01:24:57,198
- Where do you think it's taking them?
- Any planet but here.

1434
01:25:00,664 --> 01:25:02,746
I wanna talk
to whoever's in charge here!

1435
01:25:03,709 --> 01:25:07,543
Well, well, well. Charlotte Mearing.

1436
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,292
Agent Simmons.
Former Agent Simmons.

1437
01:25:10,382 --> 01:25:12,623
So I see you survived Washington.

1438
01:25:12,718 --> 01:25:16,677
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.
I survive. I will survive.

1439
01:25:17,431 --> 01:25:21,049
They're bringing everybody in, kid.
Putting all the intel on the table.

1440
01:25:21,393 --> 01:25:26,433
And if you think deporting nine Autobots
is gonna solve a damn thing...

1441
01:25:26,523 --> 01:25:27,763
It's out of my hands.

1442
01:25:28,567 --> 01:25:30,307
Moving up in the world?

1443
01:25:31,487 --> 01:25:34,399
Your booty looks excellent.

1444
01:25:37,826 --> 01:25:39,282
If you ever say a word to anyone

1445
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:40,906
about what happened
that night in Quantico,

1446
01:25:41,538 --> 01:25:42,778
I'll cut your heart out.

1447
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,905
You already did.

1448
01:25:45,626 --> 01:25:48,663
Sammy, listen to me.
Don't let them exile us.

1449
01:25:48,754 --> 01:25:51,461
- Don't let them take us, Sam.
- It's a Decepticon trap.

1450
01:26:28,212 --> 01:26:31,295
Check the nitrogen levels.
We're booking out of here.

1451
01:26:33,968 --> 01:26:34,957
Optimus?

1452
01:26:35,136 --> 01:26:39,630
What your leaders say is true.
This was all my fault.

1453
01:26:40,182 --> 01:26:44,346
I told them whom to trust.
I was so wrong.

1454
01:26:44,561 --> 01:26:46,973
That doesn't make it your fault.
It just makes you human for a change.

1455
01:26:47,522 --> 01:26:48,853
Remember this.

1456
01:26:49,566 --> 01:26:51,807
You may lose your faith in us,

1457
01:26:52,485 --> 01:26:55,477
but never in yourselves.

1458
01:27:02,495 --> 01:27:04,360
I need to know
how you're gonna fight back.

1459
01:27:06,082 --> 01:27:08,698
I know this is strategy,
I know you're coming back

1460
01:27:08,793 --> 01:27:10,704
with reinforcements, something.
I know there's a plan.

1461
01:27:15,008 --> 01:27:17,340
You can tell me.
No other human will ever know.

1462
01:27:19,095 --> 01:27:20,505
There is no plan.

1463
01:27:22,182 --> 01:27:24,639
If we just do what they want,
how are we gonna live with ourselves?

1464
01:27:26,644 --> 01:27:28,680
You are my friend, Sam.

1465
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:31,179
You always will be.

1466
01:27:31,901 --> 01:27:34,187
But your leaders have spoken.

1467
01:27:35,988 --> 01:27:37,444
From here,

1468
01:27:38,574 --> 01:27:40,656
the fight will be your own.

1469
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,546
Make it short.

1470
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:57,756
We're loading up.

1471
01:27:58,677 --> 01:28:02,386
All right, hustle up!
We're launching at dawn.

1472
01:28:05,726 --> 01:28:09,435
We're gonna do whatever we can.
Make it like it was.

1473
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:12,764
You will always be my friend, Sam.

1474
01:28:13,609 --> 01:28:15,190
I gotta be going on.

1475
01:28:29,917 --> 01:28:31,782
Years from now, they're gonna ask us,

1476
01:28:33,128 --> 01:28:35,244
"Where were you
when they took over the planet?"

1477
01:28:37,508 --> 01:28:38,873
We're gonna say,

1478
01:28:40,678 --> 01:28:42,418
"We just stood by and watched."

1479
01:28:56,402 --> 01:28:58,768
You should really look at this
as a partnership.

1480
01:28:59,698 --> 01:29:01,359
You have to stand
on the side of progress

1481
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:02,905
if you wanna be a part of history.

1482
01:29:15,964 --> 01:29:18,706
<i>Seven, six, five,</i>

1483
01:29:18,884 --> 01:29:21,626
<i>four, three, two,</i>

1484
01:29:22,095 --> 01:29:23,631
<i>one, zero.</i>

1485
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,561
<i>Go ahead and throttle up.</i>

1486
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:52,914
You wanted an answer. You got one.

1487
01:29:53,376 --> 01:29:56,539
<i>I always get what I want, Sam.
We just needed to be sure.</i>

1488
01:29:57,255 --> 01:29:58,335
Sure of what?

1489
01:29:58,465 --> 01:29:59,671
That they would go without a fight.

1490
01:30:10,352 --> 01:30:12,183
<i>- Say again.
- Tracking an incoming object.</i>

1491
01:31:04,908 --> 01:31:06,273
We all work for the Decepticons now.

1492
01:31:12,207 --> 01:31:14,368
I need your help to track a phone call.
There's a man on this phone.

1493
01:31:14,459 --> 01:31:16,495
He's the head of their human operations
and he has Carly hostage.

1494
01:31:16,586 --> 01:31:18,417
I want you to sit down. Don't move.

1495
01:31:20,674 --> 01:31:21,834
Follow me.

1496
01:31:22,759 --> 01:31:24,295
I'm watching him drive up right now.

1497
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:29,846
The call was placed en route.

1498
01:31:29,933 --> 01:31:32,174
I'm hacking into
the phone's camera now.

1499
01:31:32,602 --> 01:31:34,638
There, that's it.
That's a live stream from the camera.

1500
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:37,062
Someplace... Hold on.
I can triangulate this.

1501
01:31:38,275 --> 01:31:40,436
Okay, it's Chicago cell sites.
There, I've got it.

1502
01:31:40,777 --> 01:31:43,234
Trump Tower, Chicago.
Lower penthouse.

1503
01:31:43,405 --> 01:31:44,736
We're on.

1504
01:31:47,075 --> 01:31:48,815
- I'm going.
- You sure?

1505
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:51,617
She's done nothing but try to help me,
and I can be there in 15 hours.

1506
01:31:51,705 --> 01:31:53,946
You're not going alone.

1507
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,917
I still got my NEST friends out there.

1508
01:31:59,004 --> 01:32:00,915
I'll round them up,
we'll find your girlfriend,

1509
01:32:01,006 --> 01:32:02,337
we're gonna bring this guy in.

1510
01:32:02,632 --> 01:32:03,997
Why are you helping me?

1511
01:32:04,676 --> 01:32:07,338
'Cause that asshole
killed my friends, too.

1512
01:32:23,487 --> 01:32:26,820
They said they were here for
our resources, to rebuild their planet.

1513
01:32:26,907 --> 01:32:30,149
Yes, but really
one resource in particular.

1514
01:32:30,243 --> 01:32:32,234
One unique to our planet.

1515
01:32:33,955 --> 01:32:35,240
Us?

1516
01:32:37,084 --> 01:32:38,745
You're very smart.

1517
01:32:38,835 --> 01:32:41,076
You see, they can't rebuild
without a slave labor force.

1518
01:32:41,671 --> 01:32:44,913
How many rocks up there in
the universe offer six billion workers?

1519
01:32:45,008 --> 01:32:48,171
What are you talking about?
We can't transport people.

1520
01:32:49,137 --> 01:32:51,674
They're not shipping people.
They're shipping their planet here.

1521
01:32:57,687 --> 01:32:59,097
Oh, my God.

1522
01:33:00,148 --> 01:33:01,763
What's Sentinel doing here?

1523
01:33:01,858 --> 01:33:05,601
Watch. They're spreading hundreds of
pillars around the globe right now.

1524
01:33:05,695 --> 01:33:08,277
In just a few hours,
they're gonna launch them into orbit

1525
01:33:08,365 --> 01:33:11,607
and bring Cybertron
into our atmosphere.

1526
01:33:11,701 --> 01:33:13,817
The red one there controls the rest.

1527
01:33:13,912 --> 01:33:15,948
He triggers that,
it starts the whole thing.

1528
01:33:16,039 --> 01:33:19,907
Be gone, insect operative.
Your work is done.

1529
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:22,371
Your Excellency. He's such a dick.

1530
01:33:27,176 --> 01:33:30,168
- You want this to happen?
- I want to survive. I want 40 more years.

1531
01:33:30,263 --> 01:33:32,925
You think I asked for this?
I inherited a client.

1532
01:33:33,015 --> 01:33:35,631
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here
and we're all their slaves,

1533
01:33:35,726 --> 01:33:37,341
I guess they'll still need a human leader.

1534
01:33:37,436 --> 01:33:39,768
Don't jinx me.
You want to survive, you listen to me.

1535
01:33:56,873 --> 01:34:01,663
It is time for the slaves of Earth
to recognize their masters.

1536
01:34:01,752 --> 01:34:03,367
Seal off the city.

1537
01:34:58,937 --> 01:35:01,144
Get the dogs outta here now!
Get them in the back!

1538
01:35:02,649 --> 01:35:04,810
I guess they didn't tell you about
this part, did they?

1539
01:35:04,901 --> 01:35:07,233
You think I'm at every meeting?

1540
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,561
Look, I'm safe.

1541
01:35:09,656 --> 01:35:10,987
They said I was safe.

1542
01:35:22,710 --> 01:35:23,745
Let's roll!

1543
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:32,000
We had a signal earlier.

1544
01:35:32,595 --> 01:35:33,926
It's not working.

1545
01:35:39,686 --> 01:35:42,678
<i>This is a national emergency broadcast.</i>

1546
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:50,977
<i>Chicago has suffered a massive attack.</i>

1547
01:36:01,499 --> 01:36:02,830
Wrong way!

1548
01:36:04,335 --> 01:36:06,326
Get out of here! Go back!

1549
01:36:17,224 --> 01:36:19,886
<i>There is a ring of alien ships
around Chicago.</i>

1550
01:36:19,977 --> 01:36:23,561
Our high-range bombers
were just knocked out of the sky.

1551
01:36:23,647 --> 01:36:27,606
<i>They can 't get through
enemy air defenses over the city.</i>

1552
01:36:27,693 --> 01:36:29,149
<i>Our satellites have been jammed.</i>

1553
01:36:29,236 --> 01:36:31,443
<i>We have no way to monitor
the enemy's movement.</i>

1554
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:34,397
<i>Our old NEST teams are on stand-down
holding at Grissom Air Force Base.</i>

1555
01:36:34,491 --> 01:36:36,106
We're about 10 minutes from
the battle zone.

1556
01:36:36,327 --> 01:36:38,864
We have Special Forces
trying to gain access to the city,

1557
01:36:39,079 --> 01:36:40,819
<i>and infantry is staging at the perimeter.</i>

1558
01:36:40,914 --> 01:36:43,576
Excuse me, excuse me,
it just doesn't make sense!

1559
01:36:43,667 --> 01:36:46,158
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

1560
01:36:46,253 --> 01:36:48,039
They keep shooting down our drones.

1561
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:49,461
<i>They want us blind.</i>

1562
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,627
<i>But we do have
a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.</i>

1563
01:36:52,718 --> 01:36:55,004
Well, whoever's manning
these UAV drones,

1564
01:36:55,095 --> 01:36:57,051
can we try to redirect them
toward Trump Tower?

1565
01:36:57,139 --> 01:36:59,505
The kid, Witwickety,
was on his way to Chicago.

1566
01:36:59,808 --> 01:37:03,676
Said some point-man human op is there
for the Decepticons!

1567
01:37:04,438 --> 01:37:05,848
Listen, if I know anything, I know this,

1568
01:37:05,938 --> 01:37:09,055
that kid is an alien-bad-news magnet.

1569
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:51,731
My God.

1570
01:37:52,653 --> 01:37:55,315
We came here to find her
in the middle of all that?

1571
01:37:55,406 --> 01:37:57,818
Are we really going out there, Epps?

1572
01:37:57,908 --> 01:37:59,239
I'm not going in there.

1573
01:38:00,327 --> 01:38:01,658
No one's going in.

1574
01:38:08,419 --> 01:38:09,579
I am.

1575
01:38:11,088 --> 01:38:12,498
With or without you, I'll find her.

1576
01:38:13,507 --> 01:38:16,749
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.
Is that what you want?

1577
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:18,375
Is that what you want?

1578
01:38:18,762 --> 01:38:21,549
You came all the way out here
to get yourself killed? Huh?

1579
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:22,675
Listen to what I'm saying.

1580
01:38:22,766 --> 01:38:24,506
She's here because of me.
Do you understand?

1581
01:38:24,601 --> 01:38:28,344
Listen, if you go in this building,
that's if she's even still alive,

1582
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:29,804
there's no way
you're gonna be able to reach her!

1583
01:38:29,898 --> 01:38:31,729
What do you suggest I do?

1584
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:34,191
It's over.

1585
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,941
I'm sorry, but it's over.

1586
01:38:38,574 --> 01:38:39,689
No.

1587
01:38:39,993 --> 01:38:41,574
Incoming!

1588
01:39:29,084 --> 01:39:31,245
We will kill them all.

1589
01:39:35,925 --> 01:39:38,086
Wreck ers, kill him!

1590
01:39:40,262 --> 01:39:41,843
This is going to hurt!

1591
01:39:42,181 --> 01:39:43,967
A lot!

1592
01:39:49,438 --> 01:39:52,225
Your leaders will now understand.

1593
01:39:52,316 --> 01:39:55,604
Decepticons will never leave
your planet alone.

1594
01:39:56,362 --> 01:39:59,525
And we needed them to believe
we had gone.

1595
01:39:59,865 --> 01:40:03,028
For today, in the name of freedom,

1596
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:05,450
we take the battle to them!

1597
01:40:28,227 --> 01:40:30,639
- I saw your ship blow up!
- The ship?

1598
01:40:30,771 --> 01:40:35,265
We were never in the ship!
We designed the damn thing, didn't we?

1599
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:38,396
We were hidden
in the first booster rocket to separate.

1600
01:40:38,488 --> 01:40:42,106
Splashed down back in the Atlantic,
just as planned.

1601
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,815
We ain't going nowhere.

1602
01:40:43,952 --> 01:40:46,819
Yeah, no one's exiling us.

1603
01:40:48,873 --> 01:40:52,957
The Autobots are staying right here.
We're gonna help you win this war.

1604
01:40:53,211 --> 01:40:56,169
They're surrounding the city
to make a fortress

1605
01:40:56,256 --> 01:40:59,498
so that no one can see
what they're up to inside.

1606
01:40:59,593 --> 01:41:03,131
Our only chance
is the element of surprise.

1607
01:41:03,221 --> 01:41:04,882
I think I know where to look!

1608
01:41:06,891 --> 01:41:09,724
<i>Mini-drone is on approach
to Trump Tower.</i>

1609
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:15,350
You're telling me
Sam's headed into that?

1610
01:41:16,026 --> 01:41:17,106
Poor kid.

1611
01:41:18,528 --> 01:41:20,610
Probably never got close.

1612
01:41:21,114 --> 01:41:22,479
So, you can fly this thing, right?

1613
01:41:24,034 --> 01:41:26,241
What is that... What is that?
What is that? So-so?

1614
01:41:27,245 --> 01:41:29,702
So you so-so can fly this.
That feels terrible.

1615
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:33,289
We're right behind you.

1616
01:41:40,133 --> 01:41:41,464
All right, we're going in!

1617
01:42:06,786 --> 01:42:09,323
The city is secure.

1618
01:42:09,413 --> 01:42:12,371
The humans cannot stop us.

1619
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:14,790
As the afternoon falls,

1620
01:42:14,877 --> 01:42:18,165
the rest of the pillars
will reach their launch position.

1621
01:42:18,254 --> 01:42:23,089
This is the victory I promised you
so many years ago,

1622
01:42:23,259 --> 01:42:28,094
where we rebuild Cybertron together!

1623
01:42:28,473 --> 01:42:31,306
I have deigned to work with you

1624
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:34,847
that our planet may survive!

1625
01:42:34,938 --> 01:42:38,271
I will never work for you!

1626
01:42:38,608 --> 01:42:41,816
You would be wise
to remember the difference.

1627
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:06,292
I'm so sick of this.
I'm just sick of waiting.

1628
01:43:09,682 --> 01:43:10,797
Where is she?

1629
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,430
Where is she?

1630
01:43:14,186 --> 01:43:15,301
You've got some balls.

1631
01:43:27,491 --> 01:43:28,822
No, Sam!

1632
01:43:30,745 --> 01:43:34,613
No! No, no!

1633
01:43:38,503 --> 01:43:39,743
Carly!

1634
01:43:41,256 --> 01:43:42,291
Carly!

1635
01:43:44,968 --> 01:43:46,333
Jump!

1636
01:44:20,295 --> 01:44:22,286
Bee, fire!

1637
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:23,996
Bee!

1638
01:44:47,489 --> 01:44:49,821
Autobots! They're alive!

1639
01:44:50,742 --> 01:44:53,734
Decepticons, defend the pillar!

1640
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:59,581
Raise the bridges! Find them!

1641
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,635
Sam.

1642
01:45:17,603 --> 01:45:18,718
You found me.

1643
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,144
I'd follow you anywhere.

1644
01:45:32,827 --> 01:45:35,284
Form a perimeter! Let's go, let's go!

1645
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:36,702
Well, you're crazy.

1646
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:39,996
What is that? Is that us?

1647
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:43,910
This thing's a military UAV.
Stone, check and see if it's still working.

1648
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:45,415
Yeah, it's still got power.

1649
01:45:45,506 --> 01:45:46,871
Flight Control, do you copy?

1650
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:49,586
Can... Can you rotate?
Can you do something?

1651
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:51,300
I think we got something.

1652
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:53,127
Epps! We got Epps!

1653
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,967
<i>Come on, work! Work!</i>

1654
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:57,343
All right, turn the volume up on that!

1655
01:45:57,643 --> 01:45:58,758
The kid!

1656
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,969
<i>Can you rotate or something?</i>

1657
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,893
Yes, yes! Okay, okay, okay.
They can see us.

1658
01:46:04,984 --> 01:46:06,724
<i>Chicago is ground zero,
do you understand?</i>

1659
01:46:06,819 --> 01:46:09,231
<i>- Can you hear us? You understand?
- Witwicky.</i>

1660
01:46:09,322 --> 01:46:10,687
<i>Please listen. Sentinel Prime is here</i>

1661
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:12,237
<i>and he has the pillars
to his space bridge.</i>

1662
01:46:12,325 --> 01:46:13,815
They're on top of a building
on Chicago River.

1663
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,320
It's owned by
Hotchkiss Gould Investments.

1664
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:18,198
<i>Now, the pillar that controls everything
is in the southeast cupola.</i>

1665
01:46:18,497 --> 01:46:20,704
<i>You've got to destroy the pillar.
You have to shoot down the pillar</i>

1666
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,998
<i>or they're going to transport
Cybertron here, do you understand?</i>

1667
01:46:23,336 --> 01:46:24,621
<i>- Do you understand?
- What?</i>

1668
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:28,421
Give me a G PS on the building
and on that drone! Let's go!

1669
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:30,464
Mensurate those coordinates.
Shorten the kill chain.

1670
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:32,300
Guys on the tarmac, five minutes.

1671
01:46:32,387 --> 01:46:33,422
<i>The southeast cupola.</i>

1672
01:46:33,513 --> 01:46:34,798
All right!

1673
01:46:35,849 --> 01:46:38,340
We need to move
before the fighters spot us.

1674
01:46:38,435 --> 01:46:40,676
Wait here until we scout a route ahead.

1675
01:46:41,021 --> 01:46:42,852
- Let's roll.
- Ratchet, cover high.

1676
01:46:44,024 --> 01:46:46,731
Hey, think we could use that rock et
to shoot down the pillar?

1677
01:46:46,818 --> 01:46:49,480
We're eight blocks away.
We got to get closer to take a shot.

1678
01:46:49,655 --> 01:46:52,692
Not closer. Higher.
We need a clear line of sight.

1679
01:46:52,866 --> 01:46:55,858
And it's across the river. Gonna have
a hell of a time trying to sneak up.

1680
01:46:56,244 --> 01:46:57,609
We only got one shot.

1681
01:46:58,705 --> 01:47:00,366
One shot's all we need.

1682
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:03,787
We got to be able to see
around that building from the ground.

1683
01:47:03,878 --> 01:47:06,711
Get NSA to send service specs for
any cameras in that area.

1684
01:47:06,798 --> 01:47:07,833
Maybe some are working.

1685
01:47:08,257 --> 01:47:11,044
Traffic lights. ATMs. Anything.

1686
01:47:11,719 --> 01:47:14,256
Listen up. You want to hit back?

1687
01:47:14,722 --> 01:47:18,590
We're gonna have to wingsuit in.
It's the only way to get close.

1688
01:47:19,143 --> 01:47:22,306
I can't promise anyone a ride home,
but if you're with me,

1689
01:47:22,689 --> 01:47:24,725
the world needs you now.

1690
01:47:25,358 --> 01:47:27,724
I'll find my own ride home, sir.

1691
01:47:30,571 --> 01:47:31,686
Who else?

1692
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:36,065
General Morshower,

1693
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,650
requesting diversionary action
to the south of the city.

1694
01:47:38,745 --> 01:47:41,077
<i>We're coming north and low.
You guys drive them to the east.</i>

1695
01:47:58,099 --> 01:48:00,306
Autobot victory! Autobot victory!

1696
01:48:32,759 --> 01:48:35,592
That is one scary-ass Decepticon!

1697
01:48:35,678 --> 01:48:39,671
They got my trailer.
I need that flight tech.

1698
01:48:40,141 --> 01:48:44,305
Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once.
Wreck ers,

1699
01:48:45,021 --> 01:48:46,727
we need a diversion.

1700
01:48:46,814 --> 01:48:49,476
- Let's get some!
- You got that right.

1701
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:52,726
Listen, we're gonna circle around
to that glass building.

1702
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:54,776
And we'll get high enough
to make the rocket shot

1703
01:48:55,073 --> 01:48:56,404
while you guys draw his fire.

1704
01:48:56,491 --> 01:48:57,981
- Let's move!
- Wait a minute!

1705
01:48:58,076 --> 01:49:01,409
I'm not letting you go out there
without my urban combat prototypes.

1706
01:49:01,496 --> 01:49:03,157
- We got to go, Que!
- Come on.

1707
01:49:03,289 --> 01:49:05,245
They're great inventions for kicking ass!

1708
01:49:05,333 --> 01:49:06,413
What are these?

1709
01:49:06,501 --> 01:49:10,244
Those are boom-sticks.
Armed in 30 seconds.

1710
01:49:10,338 --> 01:49:12,044
Grapple gloves, for climbing.

1711
01:49:12,965 --> 01:49:14,455
Go, go! Move your ass! Move, move!

1712
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:17,132
Move, move! Go, go, go!

1713
01:49:22,391 --> 01:49:24,177
- Move, move!
- Let's go!

1714
01:49:36,156 --> 01:49:37,646
Let's go! Run!

1715
01:49:44,998 --> 01:49:46,408
- Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
- No, no, no!

1716
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:48,991
- Where you going?
- Stop, stop, stop! Don't leave!

1717
01:49:49,086 --> 01:49:52,920
You never leave a 'bot behind!
Shockwave's coming!

1718
01:49:57,678 --> 01:49:58,793
Go for the stairs!

1719
01:49:58,887 --> 01:50:00,502
Epps, this way!

1720
01:50:01,932 --> 01:50:03,672
<i>Breaking right.</i>

1721
01:50:03,767 --> 01:50:05,098
<i>Bead. Rolling in.</i>

1722
01:50:10,232 --> 01:50:11,347
We got another one coming around.

1723
01:50:11,441 --> 01:50:13,523
Coming around on the left side,
coming around on the right side.

1724
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:15,976
We're going to use Willis Tower
for cover!

1725
01:50:16,071 --> 01:50:17,936
Once we make altitude, we jump!

1726
01:50:18,031 --> 01:50:20,943
- A lot of airplanes out here!
- Contact off the nose.

1727
01:50:23,287 --> 01:50:24,697
<i>Mayday! I don't think
he's gonna make it.</i>

1728
01:50:24,788 --> 01:50:27,404
<i>- Mayday, mayday! Six-one going down.
- Heads up! Heads up!</i>

1729
01:50:31,962 --> 01:50:33,418
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1730
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:45,051
<i>- Tally on the left.
- Got him.</i>

1731
01:50:47,186 --> 01:50:49,347
Here we go! Here we go!

1732
01:50:49,646 --> 01:50:51,056
Keep it tight!

1733
01:50:51,149 --> 01:50:52,264
<i>Coming around.</i>

1734
01:50:52,483 --> 01:50:54,474
All right, focus, focus, focus.

1735
01:50:59,490 --> 01:51:01,230
<i>Threat above tower, six o'clock!</i>

1736
01:51:01,326 --> 01:51:02,611
Locusts!

1737
01:51:02,702 --> 01:51:04,363
<i>Look out! Breaking right! Breaking right!</i>

1738
01:51:06,789 --> 01:51:09,747
<i>- Watch out, watch out!
- Holy shit!</i>

1739
01:51:11,795 --> 01:51:13,205
Look out, look out, look out!

1740
01:51:13,297 --> 01:51:14,457
Get them out, get them out,
get them out!

1741
01:51:14,548 --> 01:51:16,789
- Everybody out, out, out!
- Jump, jump, jump!

1742
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:25,096
Get out, get out!

1743
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,219
I'm stuck!

1744
01:51:26,769 --> 01:51:28,259
<i>Now. Get them out now!
Get them out now!</i>

1745
01:51:29,146 --> 01:51:30,636
Help!

1746
01:51:50,501 --> 01:51:52,833
<i>Get separation.
Track away, track away!</i>

1747
01:52:12,982 --> 01:52:14,847
Hard left! Hard left!

1748
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:18,066
Six hundred feet.

1749
01:52:33,128 --> 01:52:35,164
Check your six! Check your six!

1750
01:52:35,297 --> 01:52:38,630
He's on our ass! Watch out, watch out!

1751
01:52:42,721 --> 01:52:43,756
<i>Sharp right!</i>

1752
01:52:49,393 --> 01:52:50,553
<i>Building dead ahead!</i>

1753
01:52:50,853 --> 01:52:52,184
Thread the needle!

1754
01:53:01,739 --> 01:53:03,400
Pull, pull!

1755
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:08,401
- Come on, we're high enough!
- This is a mother getting up here!

1756
01:53:08,495 --> 01:53:10,281
- Get your fat ass over here!
- I'm coming.

1757
01:53:16,337 --> 01:53:17,998
Set up the rocket!

1758
01:53:18,922 --> 01:53:20,913
- They're coming.
- Weapons status?

1759
01:53:21,008 --> 01:53:23,090
29 Bot-busters, 20 piercing D-Bot.

1760
01:53:25,429 --> 01:53:28,671
There, the building with the dome.

1761
01:53:28,849 --> 01:53:32,341
For our brothers,
let's make this trip worth it.

1762
01:53:35,481 --> 01:53:36,516
Oh, God.

1763
01:53:39,401 --> 01:53:40,891
The building!

1764
01:53:44,948 --> 01:53:46,779
They're shooting at the building!

1765
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,160
This is not a good idea.

1766
01:53:51,247 --> 01:53:52,862
- What?
- This is not a good idea.

1767
01:53:52,957 --> 01:53:54,413
- This building is unstable.
- Listen, stop for a second.

1768
01:53:54,501 --> 01:53:56,537
If we don't do what we came to do,
it doesn't matter, we all die.

1769
01:53:56,669 --> 01:53:58,660
Right? That's your target.
Come on, man!

1770
01:53:58,797 --> 01:54:00,537
I don't even care
if the building collapses.

1771
01:54:00,632 --> 01:54:02,122
I'm having a heart attack anyway.

1772
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,375
The building is going over!

1773
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:06,801
- Hang on!
- Tak e cover!

1774
01:54:11,267 --> 01:54:13,132
Keep your hands up!

1775
01:54:24,823 --> 01:54:25,983
It's okay! It stopped!

1776
01:54:26,449 --> 01:54:27,905
Guys, look!

1777
01:54:27,992 --> 01:54:30,654
- Incoming, incoming!
- Everybody hide!

1778
01:54:58,815 --> 01:55:01,101
Don't move.

1779
01:55:06,322 --> 01:55:07,528
Go, go.

1780
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,575
Run!

1781
01:55:15,666 --> 01:55:17,202
Cover fire!

1782
01:55:19,546 --> 01:55:22,913
Shoot the glass! Jump out the window!

1783
01:55:29,389 --> 01:55:30,469
Jump!

1784
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:49,898
We're gonna die!

1785
01:55:51,453 --> 01:55:53,318
Sam, I can't stop!

1786
01:55:53,747 --> 01:55:55,612
Shoot the glass!

1787
01:56:21,274 --> 01:56:22,354
Sam!

1788
01:56:47,843 --> 01:56:50,175
Is everybody okay?

1789
01:56:50,263 --> 01:56:51,298
You okay?

1790
01:56:51,389 --> 01:56:52,720
What the hell was that?

1791
01:56:52,974 --> 01:56:55,932
Driller-bot is thirsty.

1792
01:56:59,313 --> 01:57:01,304
- This evil thing's looking at me!
- What?

1793
01:57:14,328 --> 01:57:16,535
It's even got an uglier
Decepticon with it!

1794
01:57:16,622 --> 01:57:17,862
We have to evac!

1795
01:57:36,475 --> 01:57:40,184
- Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked!
- We're trapped!

1796
01:57:40,688 --> 01:57:42,895
Okay. How do we get out of here?
Hey! Come on!

1797
01:57:42,982 --> 01:57:45,268
Oh, Lord Jesus,
let me just get out of this alive.

1798
01:57:56,077 --> 01:57:57,783
Move! We got to move!

1799
01:57:57,871 --> 01:57:59,987
Why do the Decepticons
always get the good shit?

1800
01:58:00,081 --> 01:58:01,912
- Move!
- We're about to be eaten, people!

1801
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:26,226
We're gonna die!

1802
01:58:41,999 --> 01:58:44,331
- Hold on!
- Give me your hand!

1803
01:58:44,502 --> 01:58:45,992
- I'm swinging that way!
- Got her!

1804
01:58:46,087 --> 01:58:47,623
Oh, my God!

1805
01:58:47,713 --> 01:58:50,079
I'm dropping you on the fire escape!

1806
01:59:07,483 --> 01:59:08,518
Sam!

1807
01:59:09,777 --> 01:59:11,642
We gotta move!

1808
01:59:24,875 --> 01:59:27,662
I'm coming for you!

1809
02:00:22,602 --> 02:00:23,933
Optimus!

1810
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:26,682
- Wreckers!
- We're coming!

1811
02:00:27,857 --> 02:00:30,724
Decepticons around the world,

1812
02:00:30,818 --> 02:00:32,774
launch the pillars.

1813
02:01:03,727 --> 02:01:06,139
We are so lost!

1814
02:01:06,230 --> 02:01:07,561
Always left out.

1815
02:01:08,732 --> 02:01:10,472
Ka-ching!

1816
02:01:12,653 --> 02:01:14,393
It's time to lay down the law.

1817
02:01:14,488 --> 02:01:16,024
About to bring some hurt now.

1818
02:01:23,997 --> 02:01:26,409
It's starting! You see it?

1819
02:01:29,628 --> 02:01:31,289
Look out!

1820
02:01:39,346 --> 02:01:41,177
Where are Sam and Carly?

1821
02:01:43,267 --> 02:01:44,973
We'll go this way.

1822
02:01:52,025 --> 02:01:53,435
I give you one thing to do,

1823
02:01:53,527 --> 02:01:55,483
one thing to do,
and you drop the ball on that?

1824
02:01:55,571 --> 02:01:57,186
I ain't signed up for all this!

1825
02:01:57,281 --> 02:01:59,488
Got aliens blasting at me,
running around, chasing me!

1826
02:01:59,575 --> 02:02:01,816
I'm ducking through churches and
buildings and all that kind of crap!

1827
02:02:01,910 --> 02:02:04,868
This is bullshit!
I ain't signed up for this, Epps.

1828
02:02:04,955 --> 02:02:06,115
I'm trying to keep it together.

1829
02:02:10,335 --> 02:02:13,919
- What a treat! You and me, alone!
- Carly!

1830
02:02:19,303 --> 02:02:20,793
Come on, come on! Run!

1831
02:02:23,223 --> 02:02:26,010
Okay. He's after me, not you.

1832
02:02:26,643 --> 02:02:27,974
Run!

1833
02:02:29,479 --> 02:02:31,891
You can't hide, boy!

1834
02:02:34,819 --> 02:02:39,062
I just love it when
your little insect feet try to run!

1835
02:02:39,157 --> 02:02:40,613
- Sam!
- Run!

1836
02:02:45,914 --> 02:02:48,155
I thought you were working for us, boy?

1837
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:54,707
No! Sam!

1838
02:03:04,182 --> 02:03:05,797
My eye!

1839
02:03:18,111 --> 02:03:19,647
My eye!

1840
02:03:22,199 --> 02:03:24,815
Target the Decepticon!

1841
02:03:31,875 --> 02:03:33,081
Sam!

1842
02:03:38,048 --> 02:03:39,413
Please, you've got to save Sam!

1843
02:03:39,508 --> 02:03:40,918
- You've got to save him!
- What the hell is he doing?

1844
02:03:44,472 --> 02:03:46,053
This better work.

1845
02:03:46,182 --> 02:03:48,264
D-Bots! D-Bots!

1846
02:04:01,281 --> 02:04:03,772
I can't see! I can't see!

1847
02:04:03,909 --> 02:04:04,944
Sam!

1848
02:04:05,035 --> 02:04:06,900
It's on my hand! Grab the knife! Knife!

1849
02:04:06,996 --> 02:04:08,281
- I'm trying!
- Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife!

1850
02:04:08,789 --> 02:04:12,498
The bomb's gonna blow!
The bomb's gonna...

1851
02:04:12,584 --> 02:04:14,540
You human scum!

1852
02:04:14,628 --> 02:04:16,539
- We got 20 seconds on that bomb!
- What bomb?

1853
02:04:16,630 --> 02:04:17,665
You see that bomb?

1854
02:04:18,007 --> 02:04:20,168
- Cut it, cut it, cut it!
- I got it!

1855
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:22,131
How long do we have?

1856
02:04:22,928 --> 02:04:25,715
I'm gonna kick you!

1857
02:04:34,273 --> 02:04:35,683
Cut, cut, cut!

1858
02:04:37,151 --> 02:04:39,267
I'm gonna kill...

1859
02:04:56,128 --> 02:04:58,084
Well, he's dead.

1860
02:05:00,299 --> 02:05:02,631
Hey, Bee's going to run with
the rest of the Autobots

1861
02:05:02,718 --> 02:05:04,003
- and meet us at the edge of the river.
- All right.

1862
02:05:32,624 --> 02:05:35,661
It sucked me in!
There was nothing I could do!

1863
02:05:37,378 --> 02:05:38,993
This is a total cluster...

1864
02:05:39,672 --> 02:05:42,163
We got to get across the river.

1865
02:05:42,258 --> 02:05:43,919
You see that? She said the control pillar

1866
02:05:44,010 --> 02:05:45,250
- was in that first cupola.
- All right.

1867
02:05:45,762 --> 02:05:48,344
Let's go! Move! Let's move!

1868
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:50,926
<i>Tomahawks are inbound.</i>

1869
02:05:53,686 --> 02:05:55,347
I'm in the traffic cameras.

1870
02:05:56,189 --> 02:05:58,225
<i>Four Autobots are captured.</i>

1871
02:05:58,441 --> 02:06:00,352
Oh, my God. We're helpless.

1872
02:06:00,527 --> 02:06:03,234
Whatever's set to happen,
with those pulses getting faster,

1873
02:06:03,321 --> 02:06:04,527
it's gonna happen soon.

1874
02:06:05,198 --> 02:06:06,813
<i>No sign of Optimus.</i>

1875
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:10,112
How do we get these bridges down?

1876
02:06:10,912 --> 02:06:13,153
Spread out. Check in there.

1877
02:06:14,958 --> 02:06:15,993
Epps!

1878
02:06:16,084 --> 02:06:18,120
Epps, I've been looking for your ass.
How you doing?

1879
02:06:18,211 --> 02:06:20,793
Retirement is wack. Even worse,

1880
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:22,620
we can't get across the river
to that building,

1881
02:06:22,715 --> 02:06:24,626
and the Autobots
are upstairs, surrounded.

1882
02:06:30,932 --> 02:06:32,297
Just pan the camera around, all right?

1883
02:06:32,392 --> 02:06:34,303
All right. Pan... Pan right. That's you.

1884
02:06:35,395 --> 02:06:37,511
Try getting into the bridge control room.

1885
02:06:39,566 --> 02:06:41,727
What are they doing?
They're just standing there.

1886
02:06:41,818 --> 02:06:45,731
Hang on. Dutch, see if you can
hack into the bridge.

1887
02:06:46,614 --> 02:06:48,696
Sir, SEALs are here.

1888
02:06:48,783 --> 02:06:50,614
It's a good day, boys! What do you got?

1889
02:06:50,702 --> 02:06:52,818
Got a 10-man SEAL unit, sir,
tasked with vectoring Tomahawks.

1890
02:06:52,912 --> 02:06:53,901
- How long?
- Fifteen.

1891
02:06:54,123 --> 02:06:57,786
- You're my prisoners!
- Take it easy. We surrender.

1892
02:06:58,586 --> 02:06:59,917
Get off me.

1893
02:07:00,588 --> 02:07:02,249
Get off me!

1894
02:07:02,756 --> 02:07:05,543
All right, you're gonna need your
40 Mike-Mikes and frags. Go full auto.

1895
02:07:05,634 --> 02:07:09,502
The vibrations jack up their circuits.
Snipers, shoot for the eyes.

1896
02:07:09,597 --> 02:07:12,259
All right, your target is up
on top of that building, that cupola.

1897
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:15,342
How doomed you are, Autobots.

1898
02:07:15,436 --> 02:07:17,848
You simply fail to understand

1899
02:07:17,938 --> 02:07:22,272
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

1900
02:07:22,568 --> 02:07:25,105
Activating the bridge.

1901
02:07:36,624 --> 02:07:38,455
They happy about something.

1902
02:07:38,834 --> 02:07:40,699
We're in the heart of their ship.

1903
02:07:40,794 --> 02:07:42,750
Let's give 'em a little ride.

1904
02:07:42,838 --> 02:07:45,170
We gonna screw this ship up.

1905
02:07:45,549 --> 02:07:47,961
It's a 128K binary encryption code.

1906
02:07:49,303 --> 02:07:50,964
It's difficult.

1907
02:07:51,556 --> 02:07:54,548
But not for me. I'm in. Bridge down.

1908
02:07:56,061 --> 02:07:58,473
The bridge is coming down!
Someone's watching over us!

1909
02:07:59,105 --> 02:08:00,641
Come on! Let's go!

1910
02:08:00,857 --> 02:08:03,348
"Pleasure working with you, Seymour."

1911
02:08:03,443 --> 02:08:05,149
I believe you're supposed to say.

1912
02:08:05,987 --> 02:08:07,477
Good job, Dutch.

1913
02:08:14,329 --> 02:08:15,910
Get off me!

1914
02:08:40,730 --> 02:08:43,312
Hurry! They're triggering the pillars!

1915
02:08:44,567 --> 02:08:46,728
Prisoners? You're keeping prisoners?

1916
02:08:47,070 --> 02:08:49,026
Yes.

1917
02:08:49,239 --> 02:08:50,854
You need to teach them about respect.

1918
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:53,440
This was all business, but now
it's personal, do you understand me?

1919
02:08:55,036 --> 02:09:00,030
I understand.
No prisoners, only trophies.

1920
02:09:00,875 --> 02:09:04,493
Bee, I think they're going to kill us.

1921
02:09:05,547 --> 02:09:08,789
- You, your time is up.
- Wait, wait, wait!

1922
02:09:08,883 --> 02:09:11,169
We surrendered! We're your prisoners.

1923
02:09:11,261 --> 02:09:13,468
- Move it!
- Can't we talk this out?

1924
02:09:13,555 --> 02:09:17,173
We're all a bunch of good chaps!
I mean you no...

1925
02:09:19,894 --> 02:09:21,930
Why did you...

1926
02:09:29,029 --> 02:09:31,020
Good-bye, my old friend.

1927
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:34,071
You're mine now.

1928
02:09:47,589 --> 02:09:48,920
Get off me!

1929
02:09:49,592 --> 02:09:51,048
- I got to help him.
- What?

1930
02:09:51,886 --> 02:09:53,342
What are you doing?

1931
02:09:53,429 --> 02:09:55,920
- I got to help him.
- Sam, you can't help him.

1932
02:10:03,939 --> 02:10:06,180
Turn around.

1933
02:10:15,117 --> 02:10:17,699
We... We gave 'em a hell of a run.

1934
02:10:33,636 --> 02:10:35,251
We did it, Brains! We did it!

1935
02:10:35,346 --> 02:10:36,882
Rip this ship apart!

1936
02:11:15,511 --> 02:11:18,127
- We had a nice run, Brains, you and me.
- Yeah, we gonna die.

1937
02:11:34,823 --> 02:11:37,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, baby!
You all come with us!

1938
02:11:38,201 --> 02:11:40,908
Go! You guys,
follow that ground team! Go!

1939
02:11:40,996 --> 02:11:44,238
- Move, move, move!
- Epps, third floor! We're going to 45!

1940
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:51,495
All right. Two snipers, right here!

1941
02:11:53,550 --> 02:11:54,539
All right, dock up!

1942
02:11:56,178 --> 02:11:58,043
We jump in three minutes!

1943
02:12:01,142 --> 02:12:03,053
Set up shop right here.

1944
02:12:07,648 --> 02:12:08,763
Set up.

1945
02:12:10,693 --> 02:12:12,058
I'm downstairs.

1946
02:12:12,153 --> 02:12:14,735
We got five targets
and Shockwave right below us.

1947
02:12:14,989 --> 02:12:16,729
<i>Stand by to jump!</i>

1948
02:12:16,824 --> 02:12:19,156
All right, let's go! Get ready, get ready.

1949
02:12:32,465 --> 02:12:34,080
Go!

1950
02:12:43,936 --> 02:12:45,676
Snipers, take out their eyes.

1951
02:12:49,441 --> 02:12:50,931
All right, demo team, let's crank steel.

1952
02:12:59,159 --> 02:13:01,195
Turning steel!

1953
02:13:37,321 --> 02:13:38,731
Don't fire till I tell you!

1954
02:13:49,584 --> 02:13:50,994
Go!

1955
02:13:52,878 --> 02:13:54,414
Good job, kid!

1956
02:13:54,505 --> 02:13:55,540
Fire!

1957
02:14:07,810 --> 02:14:09,346
- We got him!
- Yeah!

1958
02:14:10,521 --> 02:14:12,136
He's on the run!

1959
02:14:14,484 --> 02:14:16,566
Autobots, attack!

1960
02:14:21,867 --> 02:14:23,823
Mortar that bridge!

1961
02:14:27,497 --> 02:14:29,829
It's our world now!

1962
02:14:30,709 --> 02:14:32,700
Commence transport!

1963
02:14:44,723 --> 02:14:47,339
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1964
02:15:01,990 --> 02:15:03,321
Optimus!

1965
02:15:38,276 --> 02:15:40,267
You die!

1966
02:15:48,287 --> 02:15:49,572
No!

1967
02:16:00,174 --> 02:16:02,460
Get down here, Sentinel!

1968
02:16:02,552 --> 02:16:04,634
Optimus,

1969
02:16:04,721 --> 02:16:06,632
you forget your place!

1970
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:17,143
I bring you Cybertron, your home,

1971
02:16:17,985 --> 02:16:21,148
and still you choose humanity.

1972
02:16:21,238 --> 02:16:25,151
You were the one who taught me
freedom is everyone's right.

1973
02:16:28,662 --> 02:16:30,903
I will retrigger that pillar!

1974
02:16:30,998 --> 02:16:34,081
Then you'll have to go through me!

1975
02:16:38,088 --> 02:16:39,578
Okay, I've got to try and help.

1976
02:16:39,673 --> 02:16:41,584
- I have to. You stay here.
- Don't you go. Don't go.

1977
02:16:41,675 --> 02:16:45,042
You'll be fine, okay? I promise.
I got to get to that pillar.

1978
02:16:47,306 --> 02:16:49,137
Charge the pillar!

1979
02:16:49,224 --> 02:16:50,555
We got Autobots!

1980
02:17:07,869 --> 02:17:09,825
Reinforcements!

1981
02:17:09,913 --> 02:17:12,746
Decepticon ships, fire at Optimus!

1982
02:17:17,295 --> 02:17:19,957
We're taking fire!
I need those Tomahawks now!

1983
02:17:20,215 --> 02:17:21,830
<i>First wave inbound.</i>

1984
02:17:27,972 --> 02:17:30,588
We've got to cover for Optimus!

1985
02:17:44,739 --> 02:17:47,902
Decepticons, trigger the pillar!

1986
02:17:48,618 --> 02:17:50,609
Restart that pillar!

1987
02:17:51,079 --> 02:17:52,489
Trigger the pillars.

1988
02:17:53,373 --> 02:17:57,616
I can't hold them!
The ships have us pinned!

1989
02:17:58,336 --> 02:17:59,746
No!

1990
02:18:00,088 --> 02:18:02,625
Inbound, 10 seconds! Danger close!

1991
02:18:02,715 --> 02:18:05,001
Mark-Lima-Echo-Echo, 14250!

1992
02:18:05,093 --> 02:18:06,333
Positive surface contact.

1993
02:18:06,427 --> 02:18:07,917
<i>- Target I. D.
- Target acquired.</i>

1994
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:39,082
- Dylan! Wait!
- No!

1995
02:18:42,089 --> 02:18:43,124
Dylan!

1996
02:18:44,216 --> 02:18:45,626
Stop! Stop!

1997
02:18:45,967 --> 02:18:47,207
No!

1998
02:18:47,802 --> 02:18:49,713
You can't do this, okay?

1999
02:18:50,346 --> 02:18:52,302
There's only one future for me.

2000
02:19:16,247 --> 02:19:22,584
Cybertron, you are saved, at last.

2001
02:19:31,596 --> 02:19:34,713
Have you come to surrender?

2002
02:19:35,141 --> 02:19:37,553
- Was it all worth it?
- Obviously.

2003
02:19:37,644 --> 02:19:41,683
All your work to bring Sentinel back
and now clearly he has all the power.

2004
02:19:42,065 --> 02:19:43,851
It's actually almost tragic.

2005
02:19:43,942 --> 02:19:47,059
You dare lecture me, slave?

2006
02:19:47,153 --> 02:19:49,735
Your Decepticons
finally conquering this planet,

2007
02:19:49,822 --> 02:19:51,153
and yet, their leader won't be you!

2008
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:55,574
It will be me! It will always be me.

2009
02:19:56,663 --> 02:19:58,745
In any minute now,

2010
02:19:58,831 --> 02:20:02,665
you'll be nothing but Sentinel's bitch.

2011
02:20:09,843 --> 02:20:11,504
Rock et!

2012
02:20:12,972 --> 02:20:14,178
Die!

2013
02:20:26,736 --> 02:20:28,067
You chose sides?

2014
02:20:29,197 --> 02:20:30,232
You chose wrong.

2015
02:20:36,413 --> 02:20:39,246
Always the bravest of us!

2016
02:20:42,252 --> 02:20:44,789
But you could never make
the hard decisions!

2017
02:20:47,841 --> 02:20:50,878
Our planet will survive!

2018
02:20:51,845 --> 02:20:53,051
No!

2019
02:21:02,939 --> 02:21:05,976
We were gods once. All of us.

2020
02:21:06,109 --> 02:21:08,441
- But here...
- Please!

2021
02:21:08,528 --> 02:21:10,940
...there will only be one!

2022
02:21:21,875 --> 02:21:25,584
This is my planet!

2023
02:21:36,307 --> 02:21:38,263
I just saved a whole other world.

2024
02:21:38,476 --> 02:21:41,309
You think you're a hero, huh?
You think you're a hero?

2025
02:21:41,645 --> 02:21:44,102
No. I'm just a messenger.

2026
02:21:51,489 --> 02:21:53,195
The pillar's still connected!

2027
02:21:55,117 --> 02:21:56,527
Bring it up!

2028
02:21:56,827 --> 02:21:59,034
- Bee! Let's do this!
- Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

2029
02:21:59,121 --> 02:22:00,736
Pillar's still connected!

2030
02:22:00,831 --> 02:22:03,072
Rip that pillar down!

2031
02:22:26,357 --> 02:22:30,100
Now, we need a truce.

2032
02:22:30,194 --> 02:22:33,607
All I want is to be back in charge.

2033
02:22:33,697 --> 02:22:35,779
Besides,

2034
02:22:35,866 --> 02:22:39,654
who would you be without me, Prime?

2035
02:22:39,745 --> 02:22:42,157
Time to find out.

2036
02:23:04,688 --> 02:23:07,805
Optimus, all I ever wanted

2037
02:23:07,899 --> 02:23:10,390
was the survival of our race.

2038
02:23:10,819 --> 02:23:15,153
You must see why I had to betray you.

2039
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:17,572
You didn't betray me.

2040
02:23:18,076 --> 02:23:20,408
You betrayed yourself.

2041
02:23:20,745 --> 02:23:22,281
No, Optimus!

2042
02:24:18,469 --> 02:24:20,050
Sam.

2043
02:24:59,345 --> 02:25:02,178
I love you.

2044
02:25:03,557 --> 02:25:04,797
You're the only thing
I need in this world,

2045
02:25:04,892 --> 02:25:07,508
and I'll do anything to make it up to you,
I promise.

2046
02:25:08,145 --> 02:25:10,761
I'm going to hold you to that.

2047
02:25:10,856 --> 02:25:12,346
Just never let me go.

2048
02:25:13,276 --> 02:25:14,891
I promise.

2049
02:25:20,199 --> 02:25:21,655
Rings.

2050
02:25:29,458 --> 02:25:31,039
I love this car.

2051
02:25:31,335 --> 02:25:35,123
Bee, you've got to slow it down.
You got to slow way down, okay?

2052
02:25:36,007 --> 02:25:37,247
I'm just trying to help out.

2053
02:25:39,385 --> 02:25:41,046
<i>In any war</i>

2054
02:25:41,178 --> 02:25:44,170
<i>there are calms between storms.</i>

2055
02:25:44,890 --> 02:25:46,096
You fought bravely.

2056
02:25:46,183 --> 02:25:48,799
<i>There will be days when we lose faith.</i>

2057
02:25:48,894 --> 02:25:51,727
<i>Days when our allies turn against us.</i>

2058
02:25:52,399 --> 02:25:56,813
<i>But the day will never come
that we forsake this planet</i>

2059
02:25:57,070 --> 02:25:59,561
<i>and its people.</i>

2060
02:26:20,886 --> 02:26:25,095
That's what I call
the start of a beautiful future.

2061
02:26:26,266 --> 02:26:28,222
Arrest him.

2062
02:26:28,393 --> 02:26:29,428
It was worth it!

2063
02:26:29,519 --> 02:26:31,601
- Get him out of here!
- I'd go to jail for love! I don't care!

2064
02:26:31,813 --> 02:26:34,680
Go ahead, take me in! I want to go in!
Let's go in.

2065
02:26:34,775 --> 02:26:36,606
Come on, Charlotte,
take me in right now!
