1
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,272
First time in lndia, Miss Quested???

2
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:19,734
- First time out of England.
- I envy you. New horizons.

3
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,285
Those are the Marabar Caves,
about 20 miles from you at Chandrapore.

4
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:31,204
I see.

5
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:36,793
<i>Mrs Moore returns on the Rawalpindi
on May 1 2th and your return is open.</i>

6
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,962
That is correct?

7
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:41,423
I'll be staying on... probably.

8
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:45,469
If you decide to return with Mrs Moore,
let us know as soon as possible.

9
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:47,596
I will.

10
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:53,059
Now, labels, stickers,
your ticket, Mrs Moore's ticket.

11
00:03:56,396 --> 00:04:00,233
You should have an interesting voyage.
The viceroy's on board.

12
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:02,194
Tends to liven things up.

13
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,780

15
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:38,498
Ugh.

16
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:51,928
I do think it's too bad of Ronny
not to be here to meet us.

17
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:56,141
- It is nearly a thousand miles.
- We've come 5,000 miles to meet him.

18
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:05,192
"No more than two annas each."

19
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:08,987
Thank you. Thank you.

20
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:11,573
Now... Victoria Station.

21
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,920
<i>(knocking)</i>

22
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:27,464
- Oh, dear.
- Don't worry.

23
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:32,010
- Mrs Moore?
- Yes.

24
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:34,638
I'm Mrs Turton.

25
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:36,807
My husband's the collector.

26
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:40,143
Oh... We gave our tickets
to the lndian gentleman.

27
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:45,357
The chief administrator of Chandrapore.
Ronny's "Burra Sahib".

28
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:47,567
You must be Adela.

29
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,444
Yes.

30
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:52,864
Please forgive us, Mrs Turton.
We've had a very trying day.

31
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:56,952
We just wanted to welcome you
to the fold and to say... We're off.

32
00:06:57,077 --> 00:07:01,998
We must have a drink or something later,
when you've recovered. Goodbye.

33
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:22,060
I believe you and Ronny met
in the Lake District, Miss Quested?

34
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:24,688
- Yes, we did.
- You must forgive me.

35
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:29,609
We have very few secrets in Chandrapore.
And I'm an incurable romantic.

36
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:37,159
Miss Quested was with her aunt
and I was with Ronny.

37
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:42,914
You know, Mrs Moore, Ronny's
doing splendidly. You'll be proud of him.

38
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,834
I'll second that.
He's become a proper sahib.

39
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,336
Just the type we want, if I might say so.

40
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,505
<i>(train rumbles)</i>

41
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:13,445
You know, Mr Turton,
when we get settled in,

42
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,199
we look forward to meeting some of
the lndians you come across socially

43
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:19,367
as friends.

44
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:23,622
Well, as a matter of fact,
we don't come across them socially.

45
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:27,792
They're full of all the virtues,
no doubt, but we don't.

46
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:34,090
East is East, Mrs Moore.
It's a question of culture.

47
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:48,980
Could Ronny really have become a sahib?

48
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,484
He could.

49
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:55,779
But that's why you've come here.

50
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:58,406
You'll find out soon enough.

51
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,161
She's a dreadful woman.

52
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:05,330
Yes.

53
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:09,709
We'd better go to sleep, my dear.

Hello, Mother! Where's Adela?

56
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,618
Here.

57
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:28,580
I can't believe it.

58
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,546
Antony!

60
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:45,514
Antony will see to the baggage. Forgive
me, I'm part of the reception committee.

61
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,386
Guards! Attention!

62
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:29,724
Sorry to desert you. We had to
welcome the great man back.

63
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,020
- I'd no idea he was so important.
- You hadn't?

<i>(car horn)</i>

71
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:25,739
McBryde. When he first came, Hamidullah
said he was quite a good fellow.

72
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:31,786
But they all become exactly the same.

73
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:35,290
I give any Englishman two years.

74
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:39,878
- The women are worse.
- I give them six months.

75
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:23,505
Ronny, is that a body?

76
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:26,800
Yes. I'm sorry.
We'll soon be out of this.

77
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:49,573
Why do we spend so much time
discussing the English?

78
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,825
Because we admire them, Doctor Sahib.

79
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,994
That is the trouble.

80
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,374
Tomorrow night!

81
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:14,222
English!

82
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:54,596
- Here we are, then.
- Very nice, dear.

83
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:04,940
- Are those the Marabar Hills?
- That's right.

84
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:07,734
- With the caves?
- I suppose so.

85
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:11,530
Look, you've got a busy day tomorrow.
Then we have a show at the club.

86
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:13,698
- Come on. Let's have tea.
- Yes.

87
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:21,456
<i>(RonnY) Good night, Mother.</i>

88
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:26,294
<i>- (knocking)
- Yes?</i>

89
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:29,339
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

90
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:08,587
Having listened to the evidence,
I find you guilty of cheating

91
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:11,465
under Section 41 5
of the lndian Penal Code

92
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,843
and sentence you
to two months' hard labour.

93
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:18,889
You may take the prisoner down.

94
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:30,484
- Well, how did it all go?
- We must have seen everything.

95
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:35,739
Yes, the church, the hospital,
the war memorial, the barracks.

96
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:40,202
- Mr Hadley was most thorough.
- Splendid. And now you're off to the club.

97
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:55,759
Cucumber.

98
00:16:57,093 --> 00:17:02,724
My dear, life rarely gives us what we want
at the moment we consider appropriate.

99
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:07,979
Adventures do occur,
but not punctually.

100
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:32,254
Doctor Sahib, when are we
going to get you married?

101
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:35,257
I have enough responsibilities, Auntie.

102
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:39,553
We ask the poor fellow to dinner,
avail ourselves of his professional skills,

103
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:43,181
- and you always bring up this question.
- It is the least I can do.

104
00:17:43,306 --> 00:17:45,350
This should put a stop to the trouble.

105
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:50,438
And, Begum Sahiba, I beg you once more
not to drink water out of a tap.

106
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:53,400
Please to boil it, boil it, boil it!

107
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,403
And now we can eat. Selim!

<i>(both speak Urdu)</i>

109
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:04,661
Why must you always bring up
this question of marriage?

110
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:08,665
He sends the children nearly all his salary
and lives like a low-grade clerk.

111
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,208
What more do you require?

112
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,593
This chitty has just arrived for you
from Major Callendar.

113
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:28,351
I am to report to his bungalow posthaste.

114
00:18:32,898 --> 00:18:34,733
And my bicycle has a puncture.

115
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,412
The major sahib left half an hour ago.

116
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:50,749
- And left no message?
- No message.

117
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:59,090
Mrs Lesley, it is a tonga. Come!

118
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:01,259
Oh, how splendid.

119
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:07,140
I suppose this is all right?

120
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:11,812
My dear, never look a gift-horse in
the mouth, particularly in this country.

121
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,897
Club!

122
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:17,067
Club, tonga wallah! Club!
Why doesn't the fool move?

123
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:21,154
I pay you tomorrow.

Madam, this is a mosque.
You have no right here.

129
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:33,203
- You should have taken off your shoes.
- But I have taken off my shoes.

130
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:35,664
I left them outside.

131
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,461
Then I... I ask your pardon.

132
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,007
- Let me go.
- Madam.

133
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:55,100
I am right, am I not?

134
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,477
If I remove my shoes, I am allowed?

135
00:21:57,811 --> 00:22:01,148
Of course.
But so few ladies take the trouble.

136
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:04,609
Especially if thinking
no one is here to see.

137
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:07,070
God is here.

138
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:10,365
God is here.

139
00:22:11,324 --> 00:22:14,369

May I know your name?

140
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:17,080
Mrs Moore.

141
00:22:22,002 --> 00:22:24,045
Oh.

142
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:27,382
I came from the club.

143
00:22:28,383 --> 00:22:32,721
They're doing a rather tiresome
musical play I'd seen in London.

144
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:36,850
- It was very hot.
- I think you ought not to walk alone.

145
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:40,562
There are bad characters about,
and leopards may come from the hills.

146
00:22:40,687 --> 00:22:43,356
- Snakes also.
- But you walk alone.

147
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:48,570
- I come here quite often. I'm used to it.
- Used to snakes?

148
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:52,657
I'm a doctor, you see.
Snakes don't dare bite me.

149
00:22:54,117 --> 00:22:56,161
Please.

150
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:03,293
Mrs Moore, I think you are
newly arrived in lndia.

151
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:05,879
Yes. How did you know?

152
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:08,298
By the way you address me.

153
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:09,883
Look.

154
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:19,559
Sometimes I have seen a dead body
float past from Benares.

155
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:22,395
But not very often.

156
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:24,815
- There are crocodiles.
- Crocodiles?

157
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:27,359
How terrible.

158
00:23:28,902 --> 00:23:31,363
What a terrible river.

159
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:35,116
What a wonderful river.

160
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:40,705
Please may I ask you a question now?
Why do you come to lndia?

161
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:44,042
I come to visit my son.
He's the city magistrate.

162
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:47,838
Oh, no. Excuse me.
Our city magistrate is Mr Heaslop.

163
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:51,842
He is my son all the same.
I was married twice.

164
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:54,803
And your first husband died?

165
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:57,973
He did. And so did my second.

166
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:01,184
Then we are in the same box.

167
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:05,147
And is the city magistrate
the entire of your family now?

168
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:13,280
No. I have a daughter in England by my
second husband. Stella. She's an artist.

169
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,615
Ah.

170
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,744
Mrs Moore, like yourself,
I have also a son and a daughter.

171
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,956
ls not this the same box
with a vengeance?

172
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:25,917
But not called Ronny and Stella, surely?

173
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:30,255
No indeed. Akbar and Jamila.
They live with my wife's mother.

174
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,424
And your wife?

175
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:36,178
In giving me a son, she died.

176
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:43,894
You have the most kind face
of any English lady I have met.

177
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:53,445
I think I'd better go back now.

178
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:59,034
I've got this strange feeling
I've fallen in love

179
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:02,662
- She's fallen in love?
- While I was freewheeling

180
00:25:02,996 --> 00:25:05,040
And...

181
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,334
Hooray, hooray, hooray

182
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:09,836
It's a wonderful day today

183
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:12,130
But I know that at this juncture

184
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:14,382
I can't afford a puncture

185
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:16,927
And here is my Michael...

186
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:25,894

I could have asked you in.

187
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:30,190
lndians are not allowed.

188
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:33,443
Oh.

189
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:35,612
Good night.

190
00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:54,714
There you are.
What have you been up to?

191
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,008
I'll tell you about it later.

192
00:25:57,134 --> 00:26:01,888
I had a small adventure,
and saw the moon in the Ganges.

193
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:16,236
Ah, Mrs Moore, Miss Quested,
have a drink. Have two drinks.

194
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:18,905
- It's very kind.
- My wife's on stage,

195
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,993
and Ronny's still holding
the fort for Major Callendar.

196
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:28,123
His wretched lndian assistant didn't
turn up in time, but I got my own back.

197
00:26:28,248 --> 00:26:32,419
I'm sorry about the show.
But what else can we do for you ladies?

198
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,549
Mr Turton, I'm longing to see
something of the real lndia.

199
00:26:39,217 --> 00:26:42,387
Fielding, how is one to see the real lndia?

200
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:44,806
Try seeing lndians.

201
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:48,852
- Who was that?
- Our schoolmaster. Government College.

202
00:26:48,977 --> 00:26:51,021
As if one could avoid seeing them.

203
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:54,065
Well, I've scarcely spoken to
an lndian since we landed.

204
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:56,568
Lucky you!

205
00:26:56,693 --> 00:27:00,197
If you really want to meet
some of our Aryan brothers,

206
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:02,908
how about a bridge party?

207
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:05,327
- Not the game.
- Oh...

208
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:08,330
No. A party to bridge the gulf
between East and West.

209
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:14,252

Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, even a Parsee.

I wish we could speak their language?

00:30:00,043 --> 00:30:05,590
is that Mrs Turton will soon be retired
to a villa in Tunbridge Wells.

Oh, that's Fielding.

232
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:29,447
I don't understand people inviting guests
and not treating them properly.

233
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:35,120
You and Mr Turton are the only people
who've made any attempt to be friendly.

234
00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:37,456
It makes me quite ashamed.

235
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:40,292
It's awkward, I agree, here at the club.

236
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:43,128
I envy you being with lndians.

237
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:46,965
If you and Mrs Moore would care
to meet one or two, it's easily arranged.

238
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,302
I'd love to. I'm sure she would too.

you all about reincarnation and destiny.

- I'd like that.

- Tell me, do you know a Dr Aziz?
- I know of him. I've never actually met.

242
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:07,611
Mrs Moore says he's charming.

243

- Good.

00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:31,551
Of course it's unnatural.
Now you see.

248
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:35,889
I do not see why you all behave
so unpleasantly to these people.

249
00:31:36,014 --> 00:31:40,727
- We're not out here to be pleasant.
- Ronny, what do you mean?

250
00:31:43,063 --> 00:31:48,568
lndia isn't a drawing room. We're out here
to do justice and to keep the peace.

I'm not a missionary

- As simple as that.

What do you and Adela want me to do?
Sacrifice my career?

Lose the power I have
for doing good in this country?

255
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:06,461
Good? You're speaking about power.

- I do indeed.
- Please come and see.

310
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:06,178
By a skilful arrangement of our emperors,
the same water comes and fills this tank.

311
00:37:06,303 --> 00:37:09,764
My ancestors loved water.
We came out of the desert.

312
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,517
We came over from
Persia and Afghanistan.

313
00:37:12,642 --> 00:37:16,229
And wherever we went, we created
fountains and gardens and...

314
00:37:18,315 --> 00:37:22,152
Ah, Godbole! You know Dr Aziz,
and here are our new visitors.

315
00:37:22,277 --> 00:37:26,740
Mrs Moore, Miss Quested, Professor
Godbole. We didn't realise you were here.

316
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:29,826
The sun will soon be driving us
all into the shade.

317
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:32,370
And I was enjoying the water.

318
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:38,460
Now, Mrs Moore, would you like
to have our tea served inside or out?

319
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:49,095
Dr Aziz, I wonder if you could explain
a disappointment we had this morning.

320
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:52,641
Ah, yes. I'm afraid we may have
given some offence.

321
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:55,352
That is impossible. May I know the facts?

322
00:37:55,477 --> 00:38:00,315
Yes. An lndian lady and gentleman, whom
we met at the club party the other day,

323
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,693
were to collect us in their carriage
this morning at nine.

324
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:06,905
We waited and waited.
They never came.

325
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,533
They even put off
going to Delhi to entertain us.

326
00:38:09,658 --> 00:38:12,619
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- Well, it is very worrying.

327
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:15,997
I think perhaps, young lady,
they grew ashamed of their house

328
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:20,127
- and that is why they did not send.
- That's very possible.

329
00:38:20,252 --> 00:38:23,839
- I do so hate mysteries.
- We English do.

330
00:38:23,964 --> 00:38:28,218
I rather like mysteries,
but I do dislike muddles.

331
00:38:28,343 --> 00:38:31,680
I think a mystery is only
a high-sounding term for a muddle.

332
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:34,474
The professor, Aziz and I
know that lndia's a muddle.

333
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,227
Agreed, I'm sorry to say.

334
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:40,438
There will be no muddle
when you come to visit me at my house.

335
00:38:40,564 --> 00:38:42,649
That would be very nice. Yes, Adela?

336
00:38:42,774 --> 00:38:46,486
Yes, indeed. Do please give me
your address, Doctor Aziz.

337
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,575
- Yes?
- One moment. I have a better idea.

338
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,661
Let me invite you all
to a picnic at the Marabar Caves.

339
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,706
Ladies, this will be
a most magnificent outing.

340
00:38:57,831 --> 00:39:01,793
One is transported by mountain railway
2,000 feet above the plain.

341
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:05,255
And the caves, Mrs Moore,
are a wonder of lndia.

342
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,675
- Yes, Professor?
- They have a reputation.

343
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,639
Doctor, how many caves are there?

344
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,145
I'm not exactly sure. Unfortunately,
I've never been there myself.

345
00:39:21,104 --> 00:39:23,607
My dear chap!

346
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:26,776
Professor Godbole,
have you seen the caves?

347
00:39:26,902 --> 00:39:28,778
Oh, yes.

348
00:39:30,238 --> 00:39:33,366
Well, could you tell us
something about them?

349
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:36,578
With pleasure.

350
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:44,795
Only a few have been opened.
Perhaps seven or eight.

351
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:48,340
And?

352
00:39:48,465 --> 00:39:51,134
There is an entrance which you enter,

353
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:56,723
and through this entrance, manmade,
there is a circular chamber.

354
00:39:58,058 --> 00:40:01,061
- Big?
- Not big.

355
00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:04,564
- lmmensely holy, no doubt?
- Oh, no, no.

356
00:40:04,689 --> 00:40:07,400
Ornamented in some way?

357
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:11,947
They are all the same. Empty and dark.

358
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:22,374
Well, there must be something
to account for their reputation.

359
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:24,543
lndeed.

360
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:33,927
Well, well.

361
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:38,390
Mr Fielding, I should like
to see something of the college.

362
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:42,227
Don't you come, Adela.
I know you hate institutions.

363
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:53,780
You know, Miss Quested, when I first
saw Mrs Moore it was in the moonlight.

364
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:57,159
I thought she was a ghost.

365
00:40:58,118 --> 00:41:01,037
- A very old soul.
- An old soul?

366
00:41:01,163 --> 00:41:04,249
The professor is using
the expression in its Hindu sense.

367
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:06,877
Someone who has been here
many times before.

368
00:41:07,002 --> 00:41:10,213
- Mrs Moore - a reincarnation?
- Quite so.

369
00:41:11,715 --> 00:41:14,593
- Please go on, Professor.
- Ah, yes.

370
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:18,763
- It is philosophy of some complication.
- But in simple terms...

371
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:23,185
In simple terms, Miss Quested,
life is a wheel with many spokes.

372
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:29,316
A continuous cycle of life:
birth, death and rebirth

373
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:32,068
until we attain nirvana.

374
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:36,364
I have contrived a dance
based on this philosophy.

375
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,533
Do you dance, Professor?

376
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:41,912
- Adela.
- Oh, Ronny, you're early.

377
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:44,956
Let me introduce to you
Professor Godbole and this...

378
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:49,252
What's happened to Fielding?
And what on earth are you doing?

379
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:53,173
They're seeing the college and
we're eating water chestnuts. Have one.

380
00:41:53,298 --> 00:41:55,675
No, thank you. We're leaving at once.

381
00:41:55,801 --> 00:42:00,096
- But we can't leave like this.
- It's perfectly all right.

382
00:42:00,222 --> 00:42:02,891
Bearer! Bearer!

383
00:42:09,773 --> 00:42:11,817
<i>(train whistle)</i>

384
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:25,247
You can take it from me
that picnic will never come off.

385
00:42:25,372 --> 00:42:28,834
Just like that fiasco this morning.
He'll forget he invited you.

386
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:32,129
- You're wrong.
- Notice the collar climbing up his neck?

387
00:42:32,254 --> 00:42:35,132
I like Dr Aziz.

388
00:42:40,554 --> 00:42:45,267
Aziz was dressed in his Sunday best,
but he'd forgotten his back collar stud.

389
00:42:45,392 --> 00:42:47,519
And there you have the lndian all over.

390
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:50,272
I bet he forgot the caves
are miles from the station.

391
00:42:50,397 --> 00:42:53,150
- Have you been to them?
- I know all about them, naturally.

392
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:56,945
- Naturally.
- I really cannot have this quarrelling.

393
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,196
Sorry.

394
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,497
I don't know why I get so het up.

395
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:11,585
Actually, I was taking us all
to see a game of polo. Should be good.

396
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,588
Not for me, dear. I'm going to rest.

397
00:43:14,713 --> 00:43:17,507
You and Adela can watch the polo.

398
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:36,985
- Ronny.
- Yes?

399
00:43:38,236 --> 00:43:41,740
- I want to say something.
- Yes?

400
00:43:41,865 --> 00:43:43,909
Something important.

401
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:48,872
Ronny...

402
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:54,211
I've finally decided...

403
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:56,880
we're not going to be married.

404
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:07,599
You never said we would be married.

405
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:12,813
But you were quite right to come out.
It was a good idea.

406
00:44:19,694 --> 00:44:23,031
We're being awfully English
about this, aren't we?

407
00:44:23,156 --> 00:44:25,784
I suppose that's all right.

408
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:29,162
As we are English, yes, I suppose it is.

409
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:40,507
Let's go for a little drive.

410
00:44:40,632 --> 00:44:44,094
- Oughtn't we get back to the bungalow?
- Why?

411
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:47,764
I think we should tell your mother,
talk about what we're going to do.

412
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:50,100
If you don't mind,
let's leave it a day or two.

413
00:44:50,225 --> 00:44:52,477
I don't want to upset her
any more than I have.

414
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:55,605
And besides,
you're going on that expedition.

415
00:45:00,944 --> 00:45:03,655
And why did you undertake
such an extravagance?

416
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,824
To avoid asking them to my house.

417
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:09,077
Which you had already done.

418
00:45:09,202 --> 00:45:12,497
Now we must all put
our shoulders to the wheel.

419
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:16,084
My wife will supply plates,
knives and forks.

420
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,879
And then there is the question of alcohol.

421
00:45:19,004 --> 00:45:22,048
Whisky-sodas for Mr Fielding,
ports for the ladies.

422
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:26,553
And food. The English are big eaters.

423
00:45:26,678 --> 00:45:29,723
- And Professor Godbole?
- He eats more than the English.

424
00:45:29,848 --> 00:45:33,977
- Nothing but vegetables, fruits and rice.
- And only if cooked by a Brahmin.

425
00:45:34,102 --> 00:45:37,564
And if there is a slice of beef
in the vicinity, he will throw up.

426
00:45:37,689 --> 00:45:40,275
The English can eat mutton.

427
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,906
- Even ham.
- Ham? Are you suggesting I offer ham?

428
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:48,450
Enough, enough.

429
00:45:48,575 --> 00:45:52,370
English ladies cannot sit upon the ground.
Not even on a Persian carpet.

430
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:56,124
- You must take chairs and tables.
- So you will need servants.

431
00:45:56,249 --> 00:46:00,086
Then there is also the question
of transport after the train journey.

432
00:46:00,212 --> 00:46:03,632
The caves are a considerable
distance from the station.

433
00:46:03,757 --> 00:46:07,219
I've just been to the station.
The train leaves before dawn.

434
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:11,056
Then you must take precaution
against lack of punctuality.

435
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:13,642
Better spend the night there.

436
00:46:21,316 --> 00:46:23,193
- What was that?
- Nothing.

437
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:28,323
It always happens before the hot weather,
generally with dust and thunder. Coffee?

438
00:46:28,448 --> 00:46:32,202
No, thank you. I'm off to bed.

439
00:46:32,327 --> 00:46:35,205
I know I made myself
rather ridiculous this afternoon.

440
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,459
But the truth is, I wasn't
quite sure of myself, and I'm sorry.

441
00:46:40,252 --> 00:46:43,130
Very nicely said. Thank you, dear.

442
00:46:44,297 --> 00:46:48,301
Of course, I have no earthly right to tell
either of you what you can or cannot do.

443
00:46:48,426 --> 00:46:51,555
See lndia if you like and as you like.

444
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:57,435
Sometimes I think too much fuss
is made about marriage.

445
00:46:57,561 --> 00:47:02,023
Century after century
of carnal embracement,

446
00:47:02,149 --> 00:47:05,277
and we're still no nearer
understanding one another.

447
00:47:05,694 --> 00:47:07,737
Good night.

448
00:52:37,014 --> 00:52:39,392
<i>(dogs barking)</i>

449
00:52:39,517 --> 00:52:41,602
<i>(bicycle bell)</i>

450
00:53:06,919 --> 00:53:09,964
Adela, are you all right?

451
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,883
Yes, of course.

452
00:53:15,011 --> 00:53:17,555
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing.

453
00:53:21,017 --> 00:53:24,729
I want to take back what I said at the polo.

454
00:53:24,854 --> 00:53:28,107
Oh, Ronny... I'm such a fool.

455
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:34,530
<i>(orchestra plays "Oh, Lady Be Good")</i>

456
00:53:49,086 --> 00:53:52,214
It's a funny thing,
but I don't feel a bit excited.

457
00:53:53,591 --> 00:53:57,970
Well, nothing's really changed, has it?
I feel perfectly ordinary.

458
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:02,308
It's much the best feeling to have.

459
00:54:03,851 --> 00:54:05,895
I suppose so.

460
00:54:09,398 --> 00:54:11,651
I'm sorry to have been so difficult.

461
00:54:11,776 --> 00:54:14,028
Oh, I shouldn't worry.

462
00:54:14,153 --> 00:54:20,701
It's partly to do with this country
and the odd surroundings.

463
00:54:21,786 --> 00:54:26,582
Do you mean that my bothers
are to do with lndia?

464
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:33,005
lndia forces one to come
face to face with oneself.

465
00:54:34,382 --> 00:54:37,343
It can be rather disturbing.

466
00:54:40,012 --> 00:54:42,181
Odd.

467
00:54:42,306 --> 00:54:45,226
It must be very cold in England.

468
00:54:51,607 --> 00:54:56,195
Now we must go back
and you must dance with Ronny.

469
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,157
Apart from anything else,
it will serve as a notice of intent.

470
00:55:05,997 --> 00:55:08,040
Hello.

471
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:27,536

00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,210

- You two go ahead.

477
00:58:06,177 --> 00:58:07,553
Ah!

478
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:10,222
Congratulations.
We've just heard the good news.

479
00:58:10,348 --> 00:58:12,600
Allow me to shake your hand.

480
00:58:44,924 --> 00:58:47,218
Mr Fielding, I'm Dr Lal.

481
00:58:47,343 --> 00:58:51,097
- Ah, yes. How do you do?
- Just making check on doctor sahib.

482
00:58:52,098 --> 00:58:54,809
- Major Callendar's orders.
- And?

483
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:57,770
A slight fever, perhaps.
Change of season.

484
00:58:58,354 --> 00:59:03,693
- You must get well quickly.
- Yes. There is talk of cholera in the city.

485
00:59:03,818 --> 00:59:06,320
There is always talk of cholera in the city.

486
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:08,781
Hello! Can I come in?

487
00:59:09,282 --> 00:59:12,827
Mr Fielding. Yes, please come in.

488
00:59:15,788 --> 00:59:17,832
Ah.

489
00:59:18,499 --> 00:59:21,794
- Hamidullah.
- Mr Fielding, how nice of you to come.

490
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:28,634
- And how's the patient?
- It is very good of Mr Fielding

491
00:59:28,759 --> 00:59:31,637
to condescend to visit our friend.
We're deeply touched.

492
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:34,765
Don't talk to him like that.
He does not want it.

493
00:59:35,808 --> 00:59:39,729
And he does not need three chairs.
He's not three Englishmen!

494
00:59:43,524 --> 00:59:46,360
Well, are you ill or aren't you?

495
00:59:46,485 --> 00:59:48,946
No doubt Major Callendar
told you I'm shamming.

496
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:51,115
Well, are you?

497
00:59:52,742 --> 00:59:55,620
The hot weather is coming.
I have a fever.

498
00:59:57,747 --> 01:00:00,291
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down, all of you!

499
01:00:03,586 --> 01:00:05,796
Mr Fielding, excuse. A question, please.

500
01:00:05,922 --> 01:00:08,674
- Carry on.
- Nothing personal.

501
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:12,136
Personally, we're all delighted
that you should be here.

502
01:00:12,261 --> 01:00:15,181
But how is England
justified in holding lndia?

503
01:00:15,306 --> 01:00:17,767
- Unfair political question.
- No, no.

504
01:00:18,768 --> 01:00:23,022
- I'm out here because I need a job.
- Qualified lndians also need a job.

505
01:00:23,147 --> 01:00:25,399
I got in first.

506
01:00:28,194 --> 01:00:32,156
And I'm delighted to be here. That's
my answer and that's my only excuse.

507
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:35,826
- And those who are not delighted?
- Chuck 'em out.

508
01:00:38,037 --> 01:00:40,706
lndians are also saying that.

509
01:00:55,388 --> 01:00:57,556
<i>- (speaks Urdu)
- Mr Fielding...</i>

510
01:01:00,726 --> 01:01:02,937
What are you doing out here?

511
01:01:03,062 --> 01:01:05,606
Please come back.

512
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:07,775
Of course.

513
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:17,952
Here you see the celebrated
hospitality of the East.

514
01:01:19,245 --> 01:01:24,875
Look... look at the mess.
Look at the flies.

515
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:28,713
- Look at the plaster coming off the wall.
- Oh, please.

516
01:01:29,338 --> 01:01:31,507
Here is my home,

517
01:01:31,632 --> 01:01:34,302
where you come to be insulted
by my friends.

518
01:01:34,427 --> 01:01:38,097
That was fair enough.
And you'd better get back into bed.

519
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:41,434
- And then you'll have to be off.
- You should rest.

520
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:46,355
I can rest all day thanks to Dr Lal,
Major Callendar's spy.

521
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,149
I suppose you know that.

522
01:01:48,274 --> 01:01:53,404
Major Callendar doesn't trust anyone,
English or lndian. That's his character.

523
01:01:53,529 --> 01:01:57,241
I wish you weren't under him.
But you are, and that's that.

524
01:01:59,327 --> 01:02:03,080
There we are. Try sleeping for a bit.

525
01:02:03,205 --> 01:02:07,919
Before you go, will you please open
that drawer under the clock?

526
01:02:11,672 --> 01:02:14,300
There's a grey cardboard folder.

527
01:02:14,425 --> 01:02:16,510
That's right. Open it.

528
01:02:20,014 --> 01:02:22,224
She was my wife.

529
01:02:31,817 --> 01:02:35,780
You are the first Englishman
she has ever come before.

530
01:02:38,324 --> 01:02:41,077
Now put her away.

531
01:02:41,202 --> 01:02:44,997
I don't know why you pay me this
great compliment, but I do appreciate it.

532
01:02:45,414 --> 01:02:50,920
Oh, it is nothing. She was not a highly
educated woman, or even beautiful.

533
01:02:51,921 --> 01:02:54,048
But I loved her.

534
01:02:54,173 --> 01:02:57,218
Now put her away.
You would have seen her anyhow.

535
01:02:57,927 --> 01:03:00,680
- Would you have allowed me to see her?
- Why not?

536
01:03:00,805 --> 01:03:04,684
I believe in the purdah, but I would
have told her you were my brother.

537
01:03:04,809 --> 01:03:07,728
- Would she have believed you?
- Of course not.

538
01:03:10,106 --> 01:03:12,316
Put her away. She is dead.

539
01:03:13,734 --> 01:03:16,862
I showed her to you because
I have nothing else to show.

540
01:03:24,328 --> 01:03:28,874
<i>Mr Fielding, why are You not married?</i>

541
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:33,087
The lady I liked wouldn't marry me.
That's the main point.

542
01:03:34,171 --> 01:03:36,924
That was a long time ago.
Before the war.

543
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:40,219
- You haven't any children?
- None.

544
01:03:41,012 --> 01:03:44,599
Excuse the following question.
Have you any illegitimate children?

545
01:03:44,724 --> 01:03:46,642
No.

546
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:49,562
- Then your name will die entirely out?
- Right.

547
01:03:52,106 --> 01:03:55,151
This is what an Oriental
will never understand.

548
01:03:55,276 --> 01:04:00,656
- There are far too many children anyway.
- Why don't you marry Miss Quested?

549
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:03,117
- Good Lord!
- But she's very nice.

550
01:04:03,242 --> 01:04:07,830
I can't marry her even if I wanted to.
She's engaged to the city magistrate.

551
01:04:07,955 --> 01:04:10,374
Oh.

552
01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:12,919
So no Miss Quested for Mr Fielding.

553
01:04:15,004 --> 01:04:18,841
However, she is not beautiful,
and she has practically no breasts.

554
01:04:18,966 --> 01:04:21,010
For a magistrate they may be sufficient.

555
01:04:21,135 --> 01:04:24,263
For you I'll arrange a lady
with breasts like Bombay mangoes!

556
01:04:24,388 --> 01:04:26,557
No, you won't.

557
01:04:26,682 --> 01:04:31,187
You must not tell Callendar, but last year
I took sick leave and I went to Calcutta.

558
01:04:31,312 --> 01:04:35,399
- There are girls there with breasts...
- You've made a remarkable recovery.

559
01:04:35,524 --> 01:04:38,903
- I have, I have.
- Please tell your chap to bring my horse.

560
01:04:39,028 --> 01:04:43,199
- He doesn't seem to understand my Urdu.
- I told him not to.

561
01:04:43,324 --> 01:04:47,411
But now I will release you. Hassan!

562
01:04:47,536 --> 01:04:50,081
<i>(both speak Urdu)</i>

563
01:04:52,416 --> 01:04:56,254
By the way, about this Marabar
expedition. It's going to cost an awful lot.

564
01:04:56,379 --> 01:04:59,465
Would you like me to help you call it off?

565
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:02,134
No, no. Arrangements
are almost complete.

566
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,470
I shall know exact date tomorrow.

567
01:05:04,595 --> 01:05:07,139
Well, good. Don't leave it too long.

568
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:10,643
Phew.

569
01:05:27,868 --> 01:05:30,246

How kind, how very kind!

573
01:05:56,731 --> 01:06:01,068
I'm sorry, Dr Aziz, but I've never been
at my best at this time of the morning.

574
01:06:01,193 --> 01:06:04,405
- We're here anyway.
- Yes. Excuse me. Please come.

- For this great occasion

577
01:06:22,214 --> 01:06:24,634
I've had help from all my friends.

578
01:06:24,759 --> 01:06:27,929
I think you will not need your servant.

579
01:06:28,304 --> 01:06:32,141
- No, indeed.
- Then we shall all be Muslims together.

580
01:06:32,266 --> 01:06:34,977
Antony...
I don't like him at all.

581
01:06:35,102 --> 01:06:38,731
Antony, you can go now.
We won't need you any more.

582
01:06:38,856 --> 01:06:41,609
Master told me to stay.

583
01:06:41,734 --> 01:06:44,153
Mistress tells you to go.

584
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:47,782
Master says
"Keep near ladies all morning."

585
01:06:49,033 --> 01:06:51,369
Please go.

586
01:07:10,096 --> 01:07:13,641
- What's that for?
- A surprise. You will see.

587
01:07:14,225 --> 01:07:16,811
Come, come, come. Please, come.

588
01:07:19,939 --> 01:07:22,441
You are travelling purdah.
You will like that?

589
01:07:22,567 --> 01:07:25,861
- It will certainly be a new experience.
- Yes.

590
01:07:27,697 --> 01:07:29,865
Where's Mr Fielding?

591
01:07:29,991 --> 01:07:34,203
He'll be here.
Englishmen never miss a train.

592
01:07:53,347 --> 01:07:55,641
Mr Fielding! Mr Fielding!

593
01:07:55,766 --> 01:07:57,810
I'm most awfully sorry, Aziz.

594
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:02,773
Oh, Mr Fielding, you have destroyed me.

595
01:08:02,899 --> 01:08:05,943
It was Godbole's prayers.
They went on for ever.

596
01:08:06,235 --> 01:08:08,613
- Jump on! Jump!
- No, no.

597
01:08:08,738 --> 01:08:12,199
- I must have you.
- I'm sorry, Aziz, but it really is no good.

598
01:08:14,368 --> 01:08:16,829
We'll join you... somehow.

599
01:08:18,247 --> 01:08:20,708
Mrs Moore, our expedition is a ruin.

600
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:24,086
Nonsense.
We shall now all be Muslims together.

601
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:28,633
- Dear, dear Mrs Moore.
- Go back to you carriage, Dr Aziz.

602
01:08:28,758 --> 01:08:30,801
You make me quite giddy.

603
01:08:34,055 --> 01:08:37,141
Poor Aziz.
We must try and get hold of a car.

604
01:08:37,266 --> 01:08:40,311
Can you think of anyone?

605
01:08:40,436 --> 01:08:42,313
ls anything the matter?

606
01:08:42,438 --> 01:08:45,483
- You saw the gates shut against us?
- Yes.

607
01:08:45,608 --> 01:08:49,153
- Today is Tuesday.
- Go on.

608
01:08:49,278 --> 01:08:51,948
Not a wise day
to undertake such a journey.

609
01:08:52,073 --> 01:08:54,867
Extremely inauspicious, Mr Fielding.

610
01:08:54,992 --> 01:08:57,036
Godbole.

611
01:09:12,468 --> 01:09:15,137
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

612
01:09:16,264 --> 01:09:18,266
- Memsahib.
- Oh, thank you.

613
01:09:18,391 --> 01:09:20,434
- Tea coming.
- Yes.

614
01:09:21,394 --> 01:09:23,479
What a relief after Antony.

615
01:09:24,522 --> 01:09:26,774
Rather a strange place to do the cooking.

616
01:09:31,904 --> 01:09:35,533
I always feel rather embarrassed
when people I dislike are good to me.

617
01:09:35,658 --> 01:09:38,452
And I really don't care for Mrs Callendar.

618
01:09:38,578 --> 01:09:42,123
But she's visiting a clinic and
the road goes up to just below the caves.

619
01:09:42,248 --> 01:09:45,710
We'd better leave in half an hour.
Would you care for a coffee?

620
01:10:38,846 --> 01:10:41,349
- Miss Quested!
- Oh, no.

621
01:10:45,686 --> 01:10:48,189
ls Mrs Moore awake?

622
01:10:48,314 --> 01:10:51,692
Yes. But please... go in!

623
01:10:52,026 --> 01:10:58,407
Don't worry, Miss Quested.
Look, I am Douglas Fairbanks.

624
01:11:03,329 --> 01:11:06,332
Tell me, dear. What's going on out there?

625
01:11:09,752 --> 01:11:11,879
Mrs Moore, we're almost there.

626
01:11:12,004 --> 01:11:16,133
I will now explain to you about the ladder.
It is to be your big surprise.

627
01:12:39,884 --> 01:12:42,678
You cannot imagine how you honour me.

628
01:12:45,139 --> 01:12:50,770
I feel that I am journeying back into
my past, and that I'm a Mogul emperor.

629
01:13:06,244 --> 01:13:11,749
Sometimes I shut my eyes and dream...
I have splendid clothes again.

630
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,090
And that I'm riding into battle
behind Alamgir. He too rode an elephant.

631
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,684
Horrid, stuffy place, really.

632
01:14:12,518 --> 01:14:16,939
- Everything is very well arranged.
- And here, ladies, is your port.

633
01:14:20,818 --> 01:14:24,071
The best caves are higher up,
under the Kawa Dol.

634
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:27,867
But we start in this one.

635
01:14:27,992 --> 01:14:31,203
The guide says,
everyone to go in quietly.

636
01:14:31,329 --> 01:14:36,709
All sounds make an echo, and many
sounds create inharmonious effect.

637
01:14:36,834 --> 01:14:41,547
I do hope I shall be all right.
In my early days with Ronny's father,

638
01:14:41,672 --> 01:14:45,009
I made rather a fool of myself
in the chamber of horrors.

639
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:47,595
Horrors? What horrors?

640
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,889
The waxwork museum.

641
01:14:50,014 --> 01:14:54,101
He was a very conventional young man,
which made it all rather worse.

642
01:14:54,226 --> 01:14:57,396
- This was not Stella's father?
- No, no.

643
01:14:58,105 --> 01:15:00,441
He was very unconventional.

644
01:15:02,443 --> 01:15:04,487
My goodness me...

645
01:15:05,655 --> 01:15:07,657

01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:18,282
- There you are.
- Thank you, my dear.

672
01:19:19,533 --> 01:19:23,371
I didn't know you'd gone. Now, now.

673
01:19:25,373 --> 01:19:29,460
We should be thinking of moving on
before the sun gets too high.

674
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,214
Do forgive me, Dr Aziz.

675
01:19:33,339 --> 01:19:36,509
I'm rather tired, so I think I'll stay here.

676
01:19:36,634 --> 01:19:41,222
I've never been a good walker, and you
two will get on much better without me.

677
01:19:41,347 --> 01:19:44,183
Dear Mrs Moore, nothing to forgive.

678
01:19:44,308 --> 01:19:47,061
You're right. It is quite a big climb.

679
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:50,106
And I'm glad you're not coming,

680
01:19:50,231 --> 01:19:54,026
because you're treating me
with true frankness, as a friend.

681
01:19:54,986 --> 01:19:57,071
I am your friend.

682
01:19:57,196 --> 01:20:00,324
- So may I make a suggestion?
- Of course.

683
01:20:00,449 --> 01:20:05,079
Don't take quite so many people with you
this time. You'll find it more convenient.

684
01:20:05,204 --> 01:20:09,125
- It does get rather crowded.
- Exactly, exactly.

685
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:11,502
We shall take just the guide. Right?

686
01:20:11,669 --> 01:20:15,464
Quite right. And enjoy yourselves.

687
01:21:07,225 --> 01:21:09,685
It's almost a mirage.

688
01:21:16,442 --> 01:21:18,653
Dr Aziz,

689
01:21:18,778 --> 01:21:21,239
may I ask you something
rather personal?

690
01:21:25,409 --> 01:21:28,412
- You were married, weren't you?
- Yes, indeed.

691
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:36,087
Did you love your wife
when you married her?

692
01:21:36,212 --> 01:21:40,174
We never set eyes on each other
until the day we were married.

693
01:21:40,299 --> 01:21:42,843
It was all arranged by our families.

694
01:21:42,969 --> 01:21:45,805
I only saw her face in a photograph.

695
01:21:48,349 --> 01:21:50,893
What about love?

696
01:21:52,853 --> 01:21:54,897
We were a man and a woman.

697
01:21:55,856 --> 01:21:58,359
And we were young.

698
01:23:02,131 --> 01:23:04,175
Dr Aziz,

699
01:23:05,134 --> 01:23:07,970
did you have more than one wife?

700
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:11,182
One. One, in my case.

701
01:23:21,484 --> 01:23:23,945
I'll be back in a moment.

702
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:13,095
<i>(both speak Urdu)</i>

703
01:25:17,808 --> 01:25:20,937

705
01:25:43,292 --> 01:25:45,586
Miss Quested!

706

Miss Quested?

707
01:26:10,778 --> 01:26:12,822
Miss Quested?

708
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:18,494
<i>(rumble)</i>

709
01:26:33,301 --> 01:26:37,054
- What's happened?
- Elephant taking bath, memsahib.

710
01:26:37,179 --> 01:26:39,223
Something else.

711
01:27:00,953 --> 01:27:02,830
<i>(sobs)</i>

712

Miss Quested!

714
01:27:16,802 --> 01:27:18,846
Miss Quested!

715
01:27:28,648 --> 01:27:30,691
Miss Quested?

716
01:27:34,153 --> 01:27:36,197
Fool!

717
01:27:39,533 --> 01:27:41,577
<i>(car horn)</i>

718
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:04,243
- Morning, Mrs Moore.
- Mr Fielding.

719
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:08,039
So sorry about this morning.
Everything going well?

720
01:29:08,456 --> 01:29:11,834
Have you seen Miss Quested and Dr Aziz?

721
01:29:12,043 --> 01:29:16,339
No. I've just walked up from the road.
I'm dying for a drink.

722
01:29:16,464 --> 01:29:18,507
Be with you in a moment.

723
01:29:24,263 --> 01:29:26,307
Good Lord!

724
01:29:33,189 --> 01:29:36,943
Oh, Mr Fielding, I'm so glad you're here.

725
01:29:37,068 --> 01:29:40,279
Oh, I was coming over to you.
Nothing wrong?

726
01:29:40,404 --> 01:29:45,660
Not exactly. But they went off with
the guide an hour ago - more, in fact -

727
01:29:45,785 --> 01:29:47,286
and somehow...

728
01:29:47,411 --> 01:29:50,581
I don't know this place,
but I'm sure they'll be back soon.

729
01:29:50,706 --> 01:29:53,376
Fielding! Fielding!

730
01:29:58,422 --> 01:30:02,969
Fielding. Fielding, I've so wanted you.

731
01:30:03,094 --> 01:30:05,680
- Where is Miss Quested?
- What is it?

732
01:30:05,805 --> 01:30:08,140
She went down the road.

733
01:30:08,266 --> 01:30:10,393
I think she met Mrs Callendar.

734
01:30:10,518 --> 01:30:12,979
- It looked like her car.
- Of course it was her car.

735
01:30:13,104 --> 01:30:15,189
- She drove me here.
- Oh.

736
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:19,193
Why did Miss Quested
go off with Mrs Callendar?

737
01:30:20,403 --> 01:30:21,696
I don't know.

738
01:30:21,821 --> 01:30:25,283
But, Dr Aziz, when did you part with her?

739
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,535
I don't understand.

740
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:32,039
Nor do I. I went round the corner
to have a cigarette...

741
01:30:32,164 --> 01:30:33,749
And?

742
01:30:33,874 --> 01:30:36,961
Then the guide couldn't recall
which cave she'd gone into.

743
01:30:37,086 --> 01:30:40,756
So I looked in all the caves,
and when I came out of...

744
01:30:40,881 --> 01:30:45,595
I think it was the third cave,
I... I saw these.

745
01:30:47,638 --> 01:30:52,435
And then - I think it was then -
I heard the car.

746
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,813
So I ran over to the edge
and I saw Miss Quested getting in.

747
01:30:55,938 --> 01:30:59,358
And... and then she drove away
with Mrs Callendar.

748
01:31:00,818 --> 01:31:02,862
That's all.

749
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,324
And these.

750
01:31:09,368 --> 01:31:11,621
I think we'd all better go back.

751
01:31:13,247 --> 01:31:15,833
Oh, Mrs Moore...

752
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:18,419
Our great day is in tatters.

753
01:31:20,463 --> 01:31:22,506
I will never forgive myself.

754
01:31:22,632 --> 01:31:24,675
Hassan!

755
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:27,845
Selim!

756
01:31:29,597 --> 01:31:33,267
Aziz is an innocent.
Something else must have happened.

757
01:31:33,392 --> 01:31:35,895
Of course something else happened.

758
01:31:37,647 --> 01:31:40,274
This is a dangerous place
for new arrivals.

759
01:31:40,483 --> 01:31:42,526
<i>(sobbing)</i>

760
01:31:51,827 --> 01:31:55,414
Now lie back, dear.
Do your best to relax.

761
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:16,102
You'll be better very soon now.

762
01:32:29,365 --> 01:32:35,079
After we've seen off Mrs Moore, I'm going
to take you back for a good stiff drink.

763
01:32:35,204 --> 01:32:39,375
Here we are.
Good Lord, quite a crowd.

764
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:02,773
Dr Aziz, it is my painful duty to arrest you.

765
01:33:02,899 --> 01:33:07,111
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Sir, I am instructed not to say.

766
01:33:07,236 --> 01:33:09,363
Produce your warrant.

767
01:33:09,488 --> 01:33:14,160
Sir, excuse me. No warrant is required
under these particular circumstances.

768
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:18,748
- Please refer to Superintendent McBryde.
- We certainly will.

769
01:33:18,873 --> 01:33:22,084
Come along, old chap.
Some ridiculous mistake.

770
01:33:22,209 --> 01:33:26,756
Dr Aziz, will you please come?
A closed conveyance is in the yard.

771
01:33:31,218 --> 01:33:34,847
For God's sake!
Never, never act the criminal.

772
01:33:34,972 --> 01:33:38,392
McBryde's a decent fellow.
We'll see him together.

773
01:33:38,517 --> 01:33:41,562
But my children, my name...

774
01:33:41,687 --> 01:33:44,065
Nothing of the sort.
We're coming, Mr Haq.

775
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:47,652
- What is it?
- Come. I've got a car waiting outside.

776
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,032
That's Mr Fielding's
and Dr Aziz's compartment.

777
01:33:53,157 --> 01:33:56,827
- I'll explain outside.
- I can't leave without speaking to them.

778
01:33:56,953 --> 01:34:01,916
Please come along, Mother.
I know what I'm doing. Make way, please!

779
01:34:06,128 --> 01:34:08,673
Come on.

780
01:34:08,798 --> 01:34:11,467
Take my arm. I'll see you through.

781
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:27,567
Fielding!

782
01:34:28,317 --> 01:34:30,778
Fielding, I want a word with you.

783
01:34:34,031 --> 01:34:36,659
Please... Please don't leave me.

784
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:40,997
I have to go. I'll be with you
as soon as I possibly can.

785
01:35:04,437 --> 01:35:07,023
- Please, Mother, come along.
- I will not!

786
01:35:10,276 --> 01:35:13,029
Something very terrible is happening.

787
01:35:27,543 --> 01:35:31,797
- Absolutely impossible. Grotesque.
- I'm afraid not.

788
01:35:31,923 --> 01:35:34,216
But who brings this infamous charge?

789
01:35:34,342 --> 01:35:38,804
Mrs Callendar, who witnessed
the poor girl's flight down the ravine,

790
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:42,183
and the victim herself.

791
01:35:42,308 --> 01:35:45,353
Miss Quested accuses
Dr Aziz of attempted rape?

792
01:35:45,478 --> 01:35:47,521
- Yes.
- Then she's mad.

793
01:35:47,647 --> 01:35:51,567
- I cannot pass that remark.
- I'm sorry, sir.

794
01:35:53,069 --> 01:35:56,572
But the charge must rest on
some dreadful misunderstanding.

795
01:35:56,697 --> 01:36:01,494
- Five minutes will clear it up.
- It does rest on a misunderstanding.

796
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:06,082
I've had 25 years' experience here. I have
never known anything but disaster result

797
01:36:06,207 --> 01:36:10,503
when English and lndians
attempt to be intimate.

798
01:36:15,424 --> 01:36:17,468
<i>(door slams)</i>

799
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:54,589
Oh, I hate these damned festivals.
I'll be glad when it's over.

800
01:36:54,714 --> 01:36:58,551
Always have a feeling
they might go over the top.

801
01:36:58,676 --> 01:37:01,053
You have a visitor.

802
01:37:07,894 --> 01:37:10,438
I think I'll be off. See you tonight.

803
01:37:13,107 --> 01:37:15,735
She hit him with these.

804
01:37:17,904 --> 01:37:20,031
That's how she escaped.

805
01:37:20,156 --> 01:37:23,868
If he had assaulted her, he'd scarcely
bring the evidence back with him.

806
01:37:23,993 --> 01:37:26,871
- Doesn't surprise me.
- I don't follow.

807
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:31,167
When you think of crime,
you think of English crime.

808
01:37:31,292 --> 01:37:35,796
The psychology's different here.
And particularly in regard to women.

809
01:37:35,922 --> 01:37:38,341
I've been going through his wallet.

810
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:44,639
Here's a letter from a friend
who apparently keeps a brothel.

811
01:37:44,764 --> 01:37:47,516
I don't want to hear his private letters.

812
01:37:47,642 --> 01:37:50,686
It'll have to be quoted in court
as bearing on his morals.

813
01:37:50,811 --> 01:37:54,232
Our respectable young doctor
was fixing up to see tarts in Calcutta.

814
01:37:54,357 --> 01:37:55,983
Oh, come on.

815
01:37:56,108 --> 01:38:00,154
You may have the right to throw stones
for that sort of thing, but I haven't.

816
01:38:08,788 --> 01:38:11,249
- Tell them to wait.
- Sir.

817
01:38:11,374 --> 01:38:13,417
Aye, it starts already.

818
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:18,798
Vakil Hamidullah and Mahmoud Ali,
legal advisors to the prisoner.

819
01:38:18,923 --> 01:38:20,716
Where is Miss Quested now?

820
01:38:20,841 --> 01:38:23,761
Staying with the Callendars
until she's out of danger.

821
01:38:23,886 --> 01:38:26,722
- What danger?
- She has a fever.

822
01:38:27,515 --> 01:38:32,228
But worse, hundreds of cactus spines
are embedded in her arms and legs.

823
01:38:32,603 --> 01:38:36,023
There's a danger of them
entering the bloodstream.

824
01:38:36,148 --> 01:38:37,149
Yes.

825
01:38:37,275 --> 01:38:40,778
Her scramble down that ravine
was so precipitate

826
01:38:40,903 --> 01:38:44,907
it started a small avalanche of stones
which stopped Mrs Callendar's car.

827
01:38:45,032 --> 01:38:50,288
She hooted, thinking work was
going on above, and then she saw her.

828
01:38:50,413 --> 01:38:54,166
She had got among some cactuses
and was beginning to panic.

829
01:38:58,212 --> 01:39:01,591
I suppose there's no possibility
of my seeing Miss Quested?

830
01:39:01,716 --> 01:39:03,759
She's in no state to see anyone.

831
01:39:03,885 --> 01:39:07,555
Callendar's sedated her and proposes
to keep her like that for days.

832
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:12,476
- He's worried about shock.
- I see. But afterwards?

833
01:39:12,602 --> 01:39:15,146
Why on earth do you want to see her?

834
01:39:16,439 --> 01:39:21,611
I want to ask her if she's certain,
dead certain, that it was Aziz.

835
01:39:21,944 --> 01:39:24,196
Callendar could ask her that.

836
01:39:24,322 --> 01:39:27,658
I want someone who
believes in him to ask her.

837
01:39:27,783 --> 01:39:30,536
What difference would that make?

838
01:39:30,661 --> 01:39:34,290
She is surrounded by people
who don't trust lndians.

839
01:39:35,666 --> 01:39:40,046
Look, I don't want to be an alarmist,

840
01:39:40,171 --> 01:39:44,467
but, in my opinion, the situation will
become very nasty in the next few weeks.

841
01:39:44,592 --> 01:39:46,636
I would think so.

842
01:39:47,637 --> 01:39:49,889
May I see Aziz?

843
01:39:50,014 --> 01:39:52,225
Only on a magistrate's order.

844
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:55,978
- To whom do I apply?
- The city magistrate.

845
01:39:59,857 --> 01:40:02,360
Nothing else excepting clothes, sir.

846
01:40:02,485 --> 01:40:04,737
But these were under the bed.

847
01:40:09,533 --> 01:40:12,411
- Very useful, Haq.
- Thank you, sir.

848
01:40:12,536 --> 01:40:14,997
And there is also that.

849
01:40:22,338 --> 01:40:24,840
- That's his wife.
- How do you know that?

850
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:28,177
He showed me that photograph.

851
01:40:28,302 --> 01:40:30,346
She's dead.

852
01:40:31,973 --> 01:40:35,768
I see. Well, I must press on
with the report.

853
01:40:37,436 --> 01:40:42,066
I hope to see you at the club on Saturday.
I believe Turton wants us all there.

854
01:40:55,454 --> 01:40:58,207
You are very good to greet us
in this public fashion.

855
01:40:58,332 --> 01:40:59,750
For goodness sake.

856
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:02,295
Did Mr McBryde say anything
when my card came in?

857
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,213
- No.
- I'm wanting bail.

858
01:41:04,338 --> 01:41:07,550
- Did my application annoy him?
- He wasn't annoyed.

859
01:41:07,675 --> 01:41:11,470
- And if he was, what does it matter?
- I might prejudice him against Aziz.

860
01:41:11,596 --> 01:41:14,724
Nonsense.
This is no way to be thinking.

861
01:41:14,849 --> 01:41:18,227
Aziz is innocent, and everything
we do must be based on that.

862
01:41:18,352 --> 01:41:21,939
Mr Fielding, are you on our side
against your own people?

863
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:26,986
It would seem so.
I think we'd better go somewhere else.

864
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:32,783
<i>(speaks Urdu)</i>

865
01:41:33,326 --> 01:41:37,330
- Who should be counsel for defence?
- You, surely.

866
01:41:38,122 --> 01:41:42,752
We need someone from a distance,
someone who cannot be intimidated.

867
01:41:42,877 --> 01:41:47,590
- Have you heard of Amritrao?
- Amritrao? The Calcutta man?

868
01:41:47,715 --> 01:41:51,719
- A high reputation.
- Notoriously anti-British.

869
01:41:51,844 --> 01:41:54,597
- Freedom Movement.
- That worries me.

870
01:41:54,722 --> 01:41:57,558
Amritrao would be regarded
as a political challenge.

871
01:41:57,683 --> 01:42:01,312
When I saw my friend's
private papers carried in just now,

872
01:42:01,437 --> 01:42:03,564
in the arms of that police inspector,

873
01:42:03,689 --> 01:42:06,400
I said to myself
"Amritrao is the man to clear this up."

874
01:42:06,525 --> 01:42:09,445
Let's not go too fast. We're bound to win.

875
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:13,532
She'll never be able
to substantiate the charges.

876
01:42:19,997 --> 01:42:24,585
<i>(whispers) She's been complaining
about an echo in her head.</i>

877
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:28,130
- What about the echo?
- She can't get rid of it.

878
01:42:29,966 --> 01:42:32,009
I don't suppose she ever will.

879
01:42:35,805 --> 01:42:38,266
Back in a moment.

880
01:42:43,813 --> 01:42:48,401
- Mother, that was unkind.
- Unkind? Unkind?

881
01:42:48,526 --> 01:42:51,946
What about poor Dr Aziz
and those terrible police?

882
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:55,449
- Mother, quiet, please.
- I won't be quiet.

883
01:42:55,575 --> 01:42:58,244
Aziz is certainly innocent.

884
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:04,000
- You don't know that.
- I know about people's characters.

885
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:06,335
It's not the sort of thing he would do.

886
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:11,173
Whatever you think, the case has got
to come before a magistrate now.

887
01:43:11,299 --> 01:43:14,218
The machinery has started.

888
01:43:14,343 --> 01:43:17,889
Yes. She has started the machinery.

889
01:43:19,307 --> 01:43:21,350
It will work to its end.

890
01:43:21,893 --> 01:43:23,936
<i>(speaks Urdu)</i>

891
01:43:30,776 --> 01:43:33,613
- Ah, Godbole.
- I see you are in a hurry.

892
01:43:33,738 --> 01:43:36,198
I must get out of these things
and go back to town.

893
01:43:36,324 --> 01:43:38,451
May I speak to you just for a moment?

894
01:43:38,576 --> 01:43:41,829
Er, yes. Come in,
if you don't mind me changing.

895
01:43:47,835 --> 01:43:50,880
I wanted to apologise for this morning.

896
01:43:51,005 --> 01:43:53,049
Oh, it's all right.

897
01:43:54,467 --> 01:43:57,011
I hope the expedition was successful.

898
01:43:57,136 --> 01:43:59,805
- The news hasn't reached you then?
- Oh, yes.

899
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:02,892
No. A dreadful thing has happened.
Aziz has been arrested.

900
01:44:03,017 --> 01:44:06,562
Oh, yes. That is all round the college.

901
01:44:06,687 --> 01:44:11,317
An expedition where that occurs
can hardly be called successful.

902
01:44:11,442 --> 01:44:14,737
- I cannot say. I was not there.
- No.

903
01:44:14,862 --> 01:44:17,531
I must not detain you,

904
01:44:17,657 --> 01:44:23,120
but I have a private difficulty
on which I require your help.

905
01:44:23,829 --> 01:44:27,250
I'm leaving your service shortly,
as you know.

906
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:32,129
I'm returning to the place of my childhood
to take charge of education there.

907
01:44:32,255 --> 01:44:36,884
I want to start a school that will be
as much like this as possible.

908
01:44:37,184 --> 01:44:41,188
- The point on which I desire advice is,

909
01:44:41,313 --> 01:44:44,400
what name should be given to the school?

910
01:44:45,526 --> 01:44:49,196
- A name for the school?
- A suitable title.

911
01:44:51,281 --> 01:44:54,201
Godbole, have you grasped
that Aziz is in prison?

912
01:44:54,326 --> 01:45:00,374
Yes. I only meant that when you're less
worried you might think the matter over.

913
01:45:00,499 --> 01:45:04,253
I had thought, with your permission,

914
01:45:04,378 --> 01:45:06,922
of the Richard Fielding High School.

915
01:45:07,965 --> 01:45:11,176
But, failing that,
the King Emperor George V.

916
01:45:12,302 --> 01:45:17,474
Godbole, let me ask you something. I was
under the impression that you liked Aziz.

917
01:45:17,599 --> 01:45:20,936
- Most certainly.
- Then how can you be so indifferent?

918
01:45:21,061 --> 01:45:25,816
- Don't you care what happens to him?
- It is of no consequence if I care or not.

919
01:45:25,941 --> 01:45:28,277
The outcome is already decided.

920
01:45:28,402 --> 01:45:31,113
- Destiny, karma.
- Just so.

921
01:45:31,238 --> 01:45:36,368
Mr Fielding, we are all part of
a pattern we cannot perceive.

922
01:45:36,493 --> 01:45:40,122
Why did Mrs Moore bring
Miss Quested to Chandrapore?

923
01:45:40,247 --> 01:45:42,416
To marry the city magistrate.

924
01:45:42,541 --> 01:45:44,793
Yes...

925
01:45:44,918 --> 01:45:48,255
Or to go to the Marabar with Dr Aziz.

926
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:52,968
- Or perhaps to meet you.
- Very beguiling.

927
01:45:53,093 --> 01:45:56,346
But at this moment my only interest
is to do something for Aziz.

928
01:45:56,472 --> 01:45:59,600
Excuse me, but nothing you do
will change the outcome.

929
01:46:00,017 --> 01:46:02,353
So do nothing.
ls that your philosophy?

930
01:46:02,478 --> 01:46:05,397
My philosophy is
you can do what you like,

931
01:46:05,522 --> 01:46:08,734
but the outcome will be the same.

932
01:46:24,792 --> 01:46:26,835
<i>(door opens)</i>

933
01:46:32,883 --> 01:46:34,718
Did you get bail?

934
01:46:34,843 --> 01:46:37,930
They're afraid your presence
might incite further trouble.

935
01:46:38,055 --> 01:46:40,099
Even riots.

936
01:46:44,061 --> 01:46:46,939
<i>(whispers) We've received
a telegram from Calcutta.</i>

937
01:46:47,064 --> 01:46:50,943
- From Calcutta?
- Amritrao is going to defend you.

938
01:46:51,944 --> 01:46:54,029
Amritrao?

939
01:46:54,154 --> 01:46:56,573
Read, read.

940
01:47:00,994 --> 01:47:06,125
- What is "disbursement"?
- Fee. He will not accept a fee.

941
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:39,992
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

942
01:47:40,117 --> 01:47:42,536
<i>(crowd shouting)</i>

943
01:47:42,661 --> 01:47:44,872
There's not the least cause for alarm.

944
01:47:44,997 --> 01:47:48,042
I want everything to go on
precisely as usual.

945
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:51,670
So don't start carrying arms about.

946
01:47:51,795 --> 01:47:54,131
Ladies, don't go out
any more than you can help,

947
01:47:54,256 --> 01:47:56,300
and don't talk before your servants.

948
01:47:56,425 --> 01:48:01,055
Remember, one isolated
lndian has attempted...

949
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:03,932
has been charged with
an attempted crime.

950
01:48:04,058 --> 01:48:06,769
And he will be brought to trial.

951
01:48:08,145 --> 01:48:10,689
Those drums are merely
the festival, of course.

952
01:48:10,814 --> 01:48:16,236
Yes, indeed. And no doubt they'll be
banging away throughout the night.

953
01:48:16,904 --> 01:48:19,656
Apologies, Collector Sahib, everyone.

954
01:48:19,782 --> 01:48:23,160
Heaslop's just behind me and
I want to say a word before he comes in.

955
01:48:23,285 --> 01:48:27,331
- Of course.
- He needs all our support.

956
01:48:27,456 --> 01:48:30,334
He blames himself
for allowing such an expedition,

957
01:48:30,459 --> 01:48:33,253
as indeed do I for giving the wretch leave.

958
01:48:33,379 --> 01:48:37,132
And then there's his mother.
It's been a most unsettling experience.

959
01:48:37,257 --> 01:48:40,344
The good news is that the victim
is greatly improved and...

960
01:48:40,469 --> 01:48:44,765
Ah, Heaslop, come along in.
Good to have you with us.

961
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:47,142
For goodness sake, do sit down, please.

962
01:48:47,267 --> 01:48:49,478
Up here, Ronny.
Come and join us up here.

963
01:48:49,603 --> 01:48:52,898
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

964
01:48:53,023 --> 01:48:57,444
<i>- Please, do sit down.
- (man) Some of us never got up.</i>

965
01:48:57,569 --> 01:49:00,656
We were delighted to hear
the major's report on Miss Quested.

966
01:49:00,781 --> 01:49:04,159
Thank you, sir. I didn't mean to
interrupt the meeting in this way.

967
01:49:04,284 --> 01:49:08,622
Not at all. I was saying
before you arrived that you'd refused bail.

968
01:49:09,832 --> 01:49:12,543
I was about to add

969
01:49:12,668 --> 01:49:15,713
that there's a certain member
here present

970
01:49:15,838 --> 01:49:19,883
who's known to be in contact
with the prisoner's defence.

971
01:49:20,008 --> 01:49:24,930
I'd like to say one can't run with the hare
and hunt with the hounds.

972
01:49:25,055 --> 01:49:27,641
At least, not in this country.

973
01:49:30,352 --> 01:49:34,356
- I would like to say something, sir.
- Please do.

974
01:49:35,274 --> 01:49:37,901
I believe Dr Aziz is innocent.

975
01:49:38,027 --> 01:49:40,821
I shall await the verdict of the court.

976
01:49:40,946 --> 01:49:46,285
If he is found guilty, I shall resign
from the college and leave lndia.

977
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,912
I resign from the club now.

978
01:50:04,386 --> 01:50:07,139
She's old. You mustn't forget that.

979
01:50:08,015 --> 01:50:11,894
Old people never take things
as one expects.

980
01:50:12,019 --> 01:50:15,731
They can cause a great deal of trouble.

981
01:50:30,871 --> 01:50:31,955
<i>(knocking)</i>

982
01:50:35,334 --> 01:50:39,630
- Are you all right, Mother?
- Just... just having a little rest.

983
01:50:40,297 --> 01:50:43,801
- It's very hot.
- Yes, it is.

984
01:50:43,926 --> 01:50:47,930
I do wish I could persuade you not to
undertake this journey at this time of year.

985
01:50:48,055 --> 01:50:52,434
At least stay until the monsoon.
It's very close now.

986
01:50:52,559 --> 01:50:56,480
So much to do, so little time to do it.

987
01:50:57,106 --> 01:50:59,900
To do what, Mother?

988
01:51:00,025 --> 01:51:03,153
Settle things up. See Stella.

989
01:51:04,947 --> 01:51:12,162
Get away from all this muddle and fuss
into some cave of my own, some shelf.

990
01:51:12,287 --> 01:51:15,499
Quite so. But meanwhile
the trial is coming on.

991
01:51:17,418 --> 01:51:20,254
I don't want to have anything to do with it.

992
01:51:20,379 --> 01:51:22,798
But you are an important witness.

993
01:51:22,923 --> 01:51:26,969
You dropped off after the first cave
and let Adela go on with him alone.

994
01:51:27,094 --> 01:51:29,555
No one blames you, Mother.

995
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:33,600
He stage-managed the whole thing
by frightening you with that echo.

996
01:51:33,726 --> 01:51:36,103
Mumbo jumbo, but very effective.

997
01:51:36,228 --> 01:51:38,897
You'll never understand
the nature of that place,

998
01:51:39,023 --> 01:51:42,276
nor will anyone else
in that ridiculous court of yours.

999
01:51:42,401 --> 01:51:46,071
- I don't wish to discuss it further.
- Very well, Mother.

1000
01:51:46,196 --> 01:51:49,658
Will you at least stay for our marriage?

1001
01:51:49,783 --> 01:51:53,746
- You are getting married?
- Of course. Why do you ask?

1002
01:51:53,871 --> 01:51:55,998
I wondered.

1003
01:51:56,123 --> 01:51:58,917
All this rubbish about love.

1004
01:51:59,043 --> 01:52:04,131
Love in a church, love in a cave,
as if there were the least difference.

1005
01:52:04,256 --> 01:52:08,594
And I held up from my business
over such trifles.

1006
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:10,763
I don't understand you.

1007
01:52:10,888 --> 01:52:14,892
I've never understood you
any more than you've understood me.

1008
01:52:17,269 --> 01:52:19,730
But what of Adela?

1009
01:52:21,315 --> 01:52:24,943
I like Adela. She has character.

1010
01:52:25,069 --> 01:52:27,529
Then don't you want to help her?

1011
01:52:28,697 --> 01:52:32,242
Nothing I can say or do
will make the least difference.

1012
01:52:33,285 --> 01:52:37,289
If that is really how you feel,
Mother, then you must go.

1013
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,804
Goodbye.

1014
01:54:09,381 --> 01:54:13,719
You mustn't upset yourself, my dear.
The verdict's a foregone conclusion.

1015
01:54:13,844 --> 01:54:16,680
It isn't that. I'm all right really.

1016
01:54:16,805 --> 01:54:19,516
You almost certainly
won't be called till tomorrow.

1017
01:54:19,641 --> 01:54:22,102
McBryde will take up
most of the morning.

1018
01:54:22,227 --> 01:54:27,149
Then there's Amritrao, who'll be up to his
tricks and playing to the lndian gallery.

1019
01:54:36,408 --> 01:54:38,452
<i>(shouting)</i>

1020
01:54:53,634 --> 01:54:54,885
<i>(smash)</i>

1021
01:55:46,353 --> 01:55:48,480
Come along, dear. We're there.

1022
01:57:25,661 --> 01:57:27,705
What are you doing here?

1023
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:31,667
I'm an interested party, Mrs Turton.
I've handed over to my deputy.

1024
01:57:31,792 --> 01:57:35,963
<i>- And who is your deputy?
- (gavel)</i>

1025
01:57:47,141 --> 01:57:49,351
Das is a good man, Mrs Turton.

1026
01:57:57,484 --> 01:57:59,737
Thank you, sir.

1027
01:57:59,862 --> 01:58:05,492
On April 3rd of this year,
Miss Quested and her friend, Mrs Moore,

1028
01:58:05,617 --> 01:58:10,998
were invited to a tea party at the house
of the principal of Government College.

1029
01:58:11,123 --> 01:58:17,087
It was here that the prisoner first met Miss
Quested, a young girl fresh from England.

1030
01:58:18,130 --> 01:58:23,552
Until then, the prisoner had never been
in such close proximity to an English girl.

1031
01:58:23,677 --> 01:58:26,472
In consideration of the ladies present,

1032
01:58:26,597 --> 01:58:32,061
I will merely allude you to the fact that the
prisoner is a widower, now living alone.

1033
01:58:32,186 --> 01:58:37,524
And in the course of our evidence,
I'll be providing proof of his state of mind.

1034
01:58:38,525 --> 01:58:41,236
Before taking you through
the history of this crime,

1035
01:58:41,362 --> 01:58:45,115
I want to state what I believe
to be a universal truth.

1036
01:58:46,367 --> 01:58:50,954
The darker races
are attracted to the fairer.

1037
01:58:52,373 --> 01:58:54,625
But not vice versa.

1038
01:58:55,751 --> 01:58:59,922
Even when the lady
is less attractive than the gentleman?

1039
01:59:00,047 --> 01:59:04,426
<i>- (laughter)
- Order! Order!</i>

1040
01:59:05,094 --> 01:59:08,764
Order! Order!

1041
01:59:36,542 --> 01:59:40,087
<i>(heartbeat)</i>

1042
02:00:32,431 --> 02:00:37,603
I must warn members of the public
and certain members of the defence

1043
02:00:37,728 --> 02:00:43,442
that the insulting behaviour
which marred yesterday's proceedings

1044
02:00:43,567 --> 02:00:46,028
will not be tolerated.

1045
02:00:46,153 --> 02:00:49,073
Well said, Das. Quite right.

1046
02:00:49,823 --> 02:00:52,242
- Mr McBryde.
- Thank you.

1047
02:00:53,202 --> 02:00:55,871
I shall begin by reminding you
of my contention

1048
02:00:55,996 --> 02:00:59,875
that prisoner proposed the expedition
with a premeditated intention

1049
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,504
of making advances to Miss Quested.

1050
02:01:03,629 --> 02:01:07,216
I've made it my business to visit
the Marabar during the last few days.

1051
02:01:07,341 --> 02:01:10,135
It's an inaccessible, barren place,

1052
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:14,556
entailing, as you have heard, considerable
planning and expense to get there.

1053
02:01:14,682 --> 02:01:19,853
The caves themselves are dark,
featureless, and without interest,

1054
02:01:19,978 --> 02:01:22,022
except for a strange echo.

1055
02:01:23,357 --> 02:01:26,985
A curious place
for such an elaborate picnic.

1056
02:01:27,111 --> 02:01:30,614
The servants were all supplied
by prisoner's lndian friends,

1057
02:01:30,739 --> 02:01:33,951
with one exception
of the witness, Antony.

1058
02:01:34,076 --> 02:01:40,791
Antony had received explicit instructions
from Mr Heaslop to stay with the ladies.

1059
02:01:40,916 --> 02:01:42,960
Yet he remained behind.

1060
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:48,215
Yesterday you heard him admit that he
had accepted money from the prisoner

1061
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:51,719
minutes before the departure of the train.

1062
02:01:51,844 --> 02:01:54,638
And that brought us to Mr Fielding.

1063
02:01:55,597 --> 02:01:59,018
We are asked to believe he was
prevented from catching the train

1064
02:01:59,143 --> 02:02:02,396
because another friend of the prisoner's,
Professor Godbole,

1065
02:02:02,521 --> 02:02:05,899
was saying his prayers.

1066
02:02:06,025 --> 02:02:11,238
Prayers. After a most unpleasant
altercation, I withdrew my hypothesis

1067
02:02:11,363 --> 02:02:15,534
that similar persuasion had contributed
towards this excess of religious zeal.

1068
02:02:15,659 --> 02:02:17,953
I object, sir.

1069
02:02:18,078 --> 02:02:22,666
Mr McBryde is quite blatantly using
this opportunity to repeat the slander.

1070
02:02:23,751 --> 02:02:25,753
- Objection sustained!
- Ha!

1071
02:02:25,878 --> 02:02:27,629
<i>(laughter)</i>

1072
02:02:29,339 --> 02:02:32,926
Order! Order!

1073
02:02:35,346 --> 02:02:37,389
Order!

1074
02:02:42,061 --> 02:02:46,523
Prisoner had yet to rid himself
of a third impediment.

1075
02:02:46,648 --> 02:02:48,692
The lady in question

1076
02:02:48,817 --> 02:02:53,155
suffered from what is known in medical
parlance as "claustrophobia".

1077
02:02:54,031 --> 02:02:57,826
Prisoner achieved his objective
by entering a cave with Miss Quested,

1078
02:02:57,951 --> 02:03:00,496
leaving this elderly lady in the rear,

1079
02:03:00,621 --> 02:03:03,999
where she was crushed and crowded
by servants and villagers.

1080
02:03:04,124 --> 02:03:08,295
- Mrs Moore. He's speaking of Mrs Moore!
- Quiet.

1081
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:11,590
Are you accusing my client
of attempted murder as well as rape?

1082
02:03:11,715 --> 02:03:14,093
Who is this lady he's talking about?

1083
02:03:14,218 --> 02:03:17,054
The lady I met in the mosque. Mrs Moore.

1084
02:03:17,179 --> 02:03:21,809
Mrs Moore? You speak of Mrs Moore?

1085
02:03:22,142 --> 02:03:24,228
I don't propose to call her.

1086
02:03:24,353 --> 02:03:27,356
You don't propose to call her
because you can't!

1087
02:03:27,481 --> 02:03:30,776
She was smuggled out of the country
because she was on our side.

1088
02:03:30,901 --> 02:03:34,029
- She'd have proved his innocence.
- You could have called her.

1089
02:03:34,154 --> 02:03:36,657
Neither side called her,
neither may quote her.

1090
02:03:36,782 --> 02:03:39,993
But she was kept from us!

1091
02:03:40,119 --> 02:03:45,249
This is English justice?
This is your British Raj?

1092
02:03:45,541 --> 02:03:48,419
Just give us back
Mrs Moore for five minutes.

1093
02:03:49,294 --> 02:03:55,259
If the point is of any interest, my mother
should be reaching Aden at noon today.

1094
02:03:55,384 --> 02:03:58,554
- Banished by you!
- Please, please.

1095
02:03:59,054 --> 02:04:03,267
- This is no way to defend your case.
- I'm not defending a case.

1096
02:04:03,392 --> 02:04:06,937
And you are not trying one.
We are both slaves!

1097
02:04:07,396 --> 02:04:12,151
Mr Mahmoud Ali, unless you sit down,
I shall have to exercise my authority.

1098
02:04:12,276 --> 02:04:15,154
Do so! This trial is a farce!

1099
02:04:16,655 --> 02:04:19,366
I'm going! I ruin my career!

1100
02:04:19,491 --> 02:04:22,327
Mrs Moore! Where are you, Mrs Moore?

1101
02:04:22,494 --> 02:04:26,874
We want Mrs Moore!
Mrs Moore! Mrs Moore!

1102
02:04:26,999 --> 02:04:29,668
Order! Order!

1103
02:04:29,793 --> 02:04:31,920
Farewell, my friend.

1104
02:04:38,302 --> 02:04:39,970
<i>(speaks Urdu)</i>

1105
02:04:40,888 --> 02:04:43,557
They have taken Mrs Moore!

1106
02:04:43,682 --> 02:04:46,310
<i>(speaks Urdu)</i>

1107
02:04:46,435 --> 02:04:50,147
- Mrs Moore!
- Mrs Moore!

1108
02:04:50,314 --> 02:04:53,484
- Mrs Moore!
- Mrs Moore!

1109
02:04:53,734 --> 02:04:56,236
- Mrs Moore!
- Mrs Moore!

1110
02:04:56,487 --> 02:04:59,281
<i>- Mrs Moore!
- (crowd chanting)</i>

1111
02:05:07,998 --> 02:05:10,042
lsn't it strange?

1112
02:05:11,043 --> 02:05:13,087
Rather wonderful.

1113
02:05:14,046 --> 02:05:17,674
<i>- I knew they'd try something like this.
- (Das) Quiet, please.</i>

1114
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:22,388
- Poor old Das.
- Quiet! Order!

1115
02:05:31,355 --> 02:05:33,649
I apologise for my colleague.

1116
02:05:33,774 --> 02:05:37,986
He's an intimate friend of our client,
and his feelings have carried him away.

1117
02:05:38,112 --> 02:05:40,823
Mr Mahmoud Ali
will have to apologise in person.

1118
02:05:40,948 --> 02:05:43,117
Exactly, sir, he must.

1119
02:05:43,242 --> 02:05:47,121
I must repeat that, as a witness,
Mrs Moore does not exist.

1120
02:05:47,913 --> 02:05:51,750
Neither you, Mr Amritrao,
nor Mr McBryde, you,

1121
02:05:51,875 --> 02:05:55,713
have any right to surmise
what that lady would have said.

1122
02:05:55,838 --> 02:06:00,217
She is not here and,
consequently, she can say nothing.

1123
02:06:02,219 --> 02:06:05,305
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

1124
02:06:05,431 --> 02:06:08,350
Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer.

1125
02:06:09,351 --> 02:06:13,897
We therefore commit her body to the deep
to be turned into corruption.

1126
02:06:14,773 --> 02:06:17,526
Looking for the resurrection of the body,

1127
02:06:17,651 --> 02:06:20,529
when the sea shall give up her dead.

1128
02:06:29,747 --> 02:06:32,583
I heard a voice from heaven
saying unto me:

1129
02:06:32,708 --> 02:06:36,712
"Blessed are the dead,
which die in the Lord."

1130
02:06:36,837 --> 02:06:38,714
<i>(chanting) Mrs Moore!</i>

1131
02:06:39,131 --> 02:06:41,008
Mrs Moore!

1132
02:06:41,925 --> 02:06:45,054
<i>(McBrYde) I now call upon Miss Quested.</i>

1133
02:07:50,285 --> 02:07:52,663
Place your hand on the book.

1134
02:07:56,458 --> 02:07:59,253
And nothing but the truth.

1135
02:08:00,045 --> 02:08:02,923
<i>(Das) Quiet, please. Silence!</i>

1136
02:08:06,468 --> 02:08:08,929
Now, Miss Quested...

1137
02:08:09,763 --> 02:08:14,476
I'd like to take you back to the moment
when you came out of that first cave

1138
02:08:14,601 --> 02:08:18,814
and found Mrs Moore
collapsed in her chair.

1139
02:08:18,939 --> 02:08:21,025
- Are you with me?
- Yes.

1140
02:08:21,150 --> 02:08:23,777
Did she offer any explanation?

1141
02:08:24,945 --> 02:08:28,699
She said she was upset by the echo
and that she was tired.

1142
02:08:28,824 --> 02:08:34,455
Taking advantage of her fatigue, prisoner
instructed the servants to remain behind,

1143
02:08:34,580 --> 02:08:37,624
and took you off alone with the guide.

1144
02:08:39,084 --> 02:08:41,920
Yes. But it was
at Mrs Moore's suggestion.

1145
02:08:42,046 --> 02:08:44,089
I don't quite follow.

1146
02:08:44,214 --> 02:08:47,468
She'd been worried by the crowd
and the stuffiness.

1147
02:08:47,843 --> 02:08:52,264
And was concerned that you might be
subjected to the same ordeal.

1148
02:08:52,389 --> 02:08:56,852
No. She wanted us
to enjoy ourselves. She said so.

1149
02:08:57,603 --> 02:09:00,064
She likes Dr Aziz.

1150
02:09:01,607 --> 02:09:04,651
Yes, I think I understand the situation.

1151
02:09:04,777 --> 02:09:10,824
Yesterday, Mr Fielding said that
Mrs Moore was "charmed" by him.

1152
02:09:10,949 --> 02:09:14,328
It was more than that. She liked him.

1153
02:09:14,453 --> 02:09:18,540
Nevertheless, you'd only met him on two
occasions before the day of the crime.

1154
02:09:18,665 --> 02:09:22,586
So it might possibly have been
a rather impetuous assessment.

1155
02:09:23,212 --> 02:09:25,964
Possibly. She's like that.

1156
02:09:27,633 --> 02:09:32,221
Miss Quested, you heard this morning the
slur cast on British justice by the defence.

1157
02:09:32,346 --> 02:09:36,850
It is most important that you tell the court
the absolute truth of what took place.

1158
02:09:37,351 --> 02:09:41,647
- I was brought up to tell the truth.
- Of course.

1159
02:09:49,154 --> 02:09:51,240
I'm sorry.

1160
02:09:51,365 --> 02:09:53,409
That's quite all right.

1161
02:09:56,578 --> 02:10:04,586
Now, Miss Quested, you went off up
the slope with the prisoner and the guide.

1162
02:10:05,587 --> 02:10:07,798
Yes.

1163
02:10:07,923 --> 02:10:12,594
Take your time and cast your mind back.

1164
02:10:21,186 --> 02:10:22,980
Miss Quested?

1165
02:10:25,566 --> 02:10:29,987
Miss Quested,
we were going up the slope.

1166
02:10:30,112 --> 02:10:32,406
ls something wrong?

1167
02:10:33,574 --> 02:10:36,035
I think it may have partly been my fault.

1168
02:10:37,411 --> 02:10:41,373
- Why?
- We'd stopped to look out over the plain.

1169
02:10:42,708 --> 02:10:47,838
I could hardly see Chandrapore
except through Mr Heaslop's binoculars.

1170
02:10:48,964 --> 02:10:53,635
I asked Dr Aziz if he loved his wife
when he married her.

1171
02:10:55,304 --> 02:10:57,598
I shouldn't have done that.

1172
02:10:57,723 --> 02:10:59,933
Then why did you do it?

1173
02:11:03,437 --> 02:11:06,106
I was thinking of my own marriage.

1174
02:11:06,231 --> 02:11:09,151
Mr Heaslop and I
had only just become engaged.

1175
02:11:10,194 --> 02:11:13,947
Seeing Chandrapore so far away,

1176
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:18,952
I realised I didn't love him.

1177
02:11:19,078 --> 02:11:21,663
<i>(murmuring)</i>

1178
02:11:21,789 --> 02:11:23,957
Quiet, please. Quiet.

1179
02:11:42,309 --> 02:11:47,022
Miss Quested, you and the prisoner
continued up to the caves?

1180
02:11:47,981 --> 02:11:50,192
- Yes.
- Where was the guide?

1181
02:11:50,317 --> 02:11:52,653
- He'd gone on ahead.
- Sent on ahead?

1182
02:11:53,028 --> 02:11:55,906
No, he was waiting for us
further along the ledge.

1183
02:11:56,031 --> 02:12:00,869
But when you reached the caves, prisoner
left you and went to speak to the guide?

1184
02:12:00,994 --> 02:12:05,541
- I don't know if he spoke to him or not.
- But he went off in his direction.

1185
02:12:05,666 --> 02:12:07,543
Yes.

1186
02:12:07,668 --> 02:12:10,921
- And what did you do?
- I waited.

1187
02:12:13,215 --> 02:12:18,095
<i>(Das) You said just now
"I think it may have been partly my fault."</i>

1188
02:12:18,220 --> 02:12:22,558
<i>- WhY?
- I had asked him about love.</i>

1189
02:12:22,683 --> 02:12:25,894
<i>And had thereby introduced
a feeling of intimacY?</i>

1190
02:12:27,479 --> 02:12:29,106
<i>That is what I meant.</i>

1191
02:12:31,150 --> 02:12:33,610
Thank you.

1192
02:12:33,777 --> 02:12:36,030
Mr McBryde.

1193
02:12:40,159 --> 02:12:44,371
Please tell the court
exactly what happened.

1194
02:12:48,459 --> 02:12:51,170
I lit a match.

1195
02:12:58,969 --> 02:13:01,013
<i>(Aziz) Miss Quested!</i>

1196
02:13:03,182 --> 02:13:05,225
Miss Quested!

1197
02:13:24,495 --> 02:13:27,122
Miss Quested?

1198
02:13:29,333 --> 02:13:32,628
<i>- And the prisoner followed you?
- (rumble)</i>

1199
02:13:35,339 --> 02:13:38,801
Miss Quested, the prisoner
followed you, didn't he?

1200
02:13:43,889 --> 02:13:47,685
Could I please have a minute
before I reply to that, Mr McBryde?

1201
02:13:47,810 --> 02:13:49,853
Certainly.

1202
02:13:59,613 --> 02:14:01,657
I'm not...

1203
02:14:04,368 --> 02:14:08,247
I'm not quite sure.

1204
02:14:08,372 --> 02:14:09,915
<i>(murmuring)</i>

1205
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:12,626
I beg your pardon?

1206
02:14:12,751 --> 02:14:16,046
You are in the cave,
and the prisoner followed you.

1207
02:14:22,886 --> 02:14:25,472
What do you mean, please?

1208
02:14:25,597 --> 02:14:28,100
- No.
- What is that? What are you saying?

1209
02:14:31,437 --> 02:14:35,149
- I'm afraid I've made a mistake.
- What nature of mistake?

1210
02:14:36,942 --> 02:14:41,739
Dr Aziz never followed me into the cave.

1211
02:14:43,574 --> 02:14:48,871
Now, let us go on. I will read you
the deposition which you signed.

1212
02:14:48,996 --> 02:14:51,206
<i>(Das) Mr McBryde, you cannot go on.</i>

1213
02:14:51,331 --> 02:14:55,377
I was speaking to the witness.
And the public will be silent!

1214
02:14:57,004 --> 02:14:59,757
Miss Quested,
address your remarks to me.

1215
02:14:59,882 --> 02:15:02,801
And remember - you speak on oath,
Miss Quested.

1216
02:15:03,927 --> 02:15:05,262
Dr Aziz...

1217
02:15:05,387 --> 02:15:07,973
I stop these proceedings
on medical grounds!

1218
02:15:08,098 --> 02:15:10,351
Quiet! Please, sit down!

1219
02:15:15,481 --> 02:15:18,400
You withdraw the accusation,
Miss Quested?

1220
02:15:18,525 --> 02:15:20,569
Answer me.

1221
02:15:20,694 --> 02:15:23,405
I withdraw everything.

1222
02:15:26,742 --> 02:15:29,286
Order! Order!

1223
02:15:33,832 --> 02:15:38,462
The prisoner is released
without one stain on his character!

1224
02:15:46,428 --> 02:15:49,431
Dr Aziz is free!

1225
02:16:08,450 --> 02:16:10,994
Are you mad?

1226
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:12,121
No.

1227
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:23,424
<i>(rumble)</i>

1228
02:16:50,909 --> 02:16:53,370

1230
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:01,397
Bitch.

1231
02:18:03,524 --> 02:18:05,734
We won!

1232
02:18:08,821 --> 02:18:11,532
What do you think you've been doing?

1233
02:18:22,042 --> 02:18:24,086
Miss Quested!

1234
02:18:29,049 --> 02:18:32,594
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1235
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:34,888
You can't wander about like this.

1236
02:18:35,014 --> 02:18:38,809
- Who did you come with?
- I shall walk.

1237
02:18:38,934 --> 02:18:42,104
What madness.
This could turn into a riot.

1238
02:18:43,605 --> 02:18:46,191
We'll find my carriage. It's closed.

1239
02:18:59,038 --> 02:19:01,081
Richard!

1240
02:19:01,749 --> 02:19:03,792
Richard!

1241
02:19:07,212 --> 02:19:11,216
- I'm coming back.
- Stay with him, please.

1242
02:19:11,633 --> 02:19:14,636
I can't leave you here.
Anything could happen.

1243
02:19:31,570 --> 02:19:34,323
- There we are.
- Congratulations, sir!

1244
02:19:34,448 --> 02:19:36,700
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1245
02:19:36,825 --> 02:19:39,411
Make way, please. Thank you.

1246
02:19:40,954 --> 02:19:44,375
- Where shall he take you?
- I don't know.

1247
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:46,543
What do you mean?

1248
02:19:48,879 --> 02:19:50,923
Get in.

1249
02:19:53,008 --> 02:19:55,135
<i>(cheering)</i>

1250
02:20:02,267 --> 02:20:04,561
That was Mr Fielding!

1251
02:20:04,687 --> 02:20:08,107
- And Mrs Moore!
- Mrs Moore!

1252
02:20:17,408 --> 02:20:21,537
Why did you make such a charge
if you were going to withdraw it?

1253
02:20:24,873 --> 02:20:29,628
- I ought to feel grateful to you, I suppose.
- I don't expect gratitude.

1254
02:20:34,967 --> 02:20:37,428
Did you do it out of pity?

1255
02:20:40,639 --> 02:20:42,683
My echo's gone.

1256
02:20:43,726 --> 02:20:47,438
I call the noise in my head my echo.
I've had it since the cave.

1257
02:20:52,276 --> 02:20:55,904
Might the whole thing
have been an hallucination?

1258
02:20:59,033 --> 02:21:02,870
I have a hunch that
poor old McBryde exorcised you.

1259
02:21:03,996 --> 02:21:08,542
He took you back,
step by logical step, into that cave,

1260
02:21:08,667 --> 02:21:11,503
and you broke down quite suddenly.

1261
02:21:11,628 --> 02:21:14,965
- I thought you meant I'd seen a ghost.
- No, no.

1262
02:21:16,967 --> 02:21:21,638
- Mrs Moore believes in ghosts.
- Well, she's an old lady.

1263
02:21:21,764 --> 02:21:24,850
No, I only meant that
it's difficult, as we get older,

1264
02:21:24,975 --> 02:21:28,020
not to believe that the dead live again.

1265
02:21:29,772 --> 02:21:32,816
Because the dead don't live again.

1266
02:21:32,941 --> 02:21:34,985
I fear not.

1267
02:21:36,653 --> 02:21:38,697
So do I.

1268
02:21:41,825 --> 02:21:43,786
<i>(Fielding) Ranjit!</i>

1269
02:21:43,911 --> 02:21:47,373
He must have gone to the tamasha,
but I can make some tea.

1270
02:21:47,498 --> 02:21:49,541
Oh, forgive me a moment.

1271
02:21:59,885 --> 02:22:01,929
Oh, dear.

1272
02:22:22,783 --> 02:22:25,661
"Annie Blair, fellow passenger."

1273
02:22:35,087 --> 02:22:37,548
I shall never see her again.

1274
02:23:05,534 --> 02:23:08,829
- Ah, Godbole.
- The boys said you were back.

1275
02:23:08,954 --> 02:23:09,830
Yes.

1276
02:23:09,955 --> 02:23:14,710
I'm leaving for Kashmir tomorrow
morning to take up my duties

1277
02:23:14,835 --> 02:23:17,129
as minister of education.

1278
02:23:17,254 --> 02:23:19,631
I came to say goodbye.

1279
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:23,635
Yes? Er... come in.

1280
02:23:24,219 --> 02:23:26,263
Thank you. Thank you.

1281
02:23:27,806 --> 02:23:29,600
Miss Quested.

1282
02:23:31,143 --> 02:23:34,146
Please, I want to give you my address

1283
02:23:34,271 --> 02:23:36,982
and extend an open invitation
for you to visit me.

1284
02:23:37,107 --> 02:23:39,485
Have you seen the Himalayas,
Mr Fielding?

1285
02:23:39,610 --> 02:23:41,737
No.

1286
02:23:45,199 --> 02:23:48,911
- Miss Quested has had some bad news.
- Oh, I am sorry.

1287
02:23:56,293 --> 02:23:59,797
- Mrs Moore.
- Yes.

1288
02:24:05,844 --> 02:24:08,764
- Addressed to you.
- Yes.

1289
02:24:09,932 --> 02:24:13,560
- Why did this lady send to you?
- I don't know.

1290
02:24:13,686 --> 02:24:16,021
Mr Fielding,
I would venture to remark...

1291
02:24:16,146 --> 02:24:21,527
Under the circumstances, I don't think
we should pursue the matter further.

1292
02:24:21,652 --> 02:24:24,655
I'm sorry, Godbole,
but Miss Quested is extremely upset.

1293
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:26,824
Of course, of course. Nevertheless...

1294
02:24:26,949 --> 02:24:30,244
I presumably came up
in a casual shipboard conversation.

1295
02:24:30,369 --> 02:24:34,289
No doubt Heaslop
will be hearing from the company.

1296
02:24:34,415 --> 02:24:37,876
- I see.
- I shan't tell Aziz until tomorrow.

1297
02:24:38,002 --> 02:24:42,047
Hamidullah's bound to be putting on
a celebration, and it'll only upset him.

1298
02:24:42,172 --> 02:24:44,925
Oh, and have you heard
about the damages?

1299
02:24:45,592 --> 02:24:51,682
- Damages?
- Amritrao is asking 20,000 rupees from...

1300
02:24:52,474 --> 02:24:55,102
20,000?

1301
02:24:55,227 --> 02:24:56,937
And costs.

1302
02:25:01,025 --> 02:25:05,070
Who could have foretold that Aziz
would be saved by his enemy?

1303
02:25:05,195 --> 02:25:07,239
What now, Mr Fielding?

1304
02:25:45,402 --> 02:25:47,446
- Aziz!
- Come in.

1305
02:25:52,201 --> 02:25:55,871
Well, what a wonderful day for you.

1306
02:25:56,872 --> 02:25:59,500
I am an lndian at last.

1307
02:26:04,129 --> 02:26:06,715
Where did you take her?

1308
02:26:07,883 --> 02:26:10,469
I took her back to the college.

1309
02:26:11,970 --> 02:26:13,347
Why?

1310
02:26:13,472 --> 02:26:16,141
After this morning,
she'd nowhere else to go.

1311
02:26:16,266 --> 02:26:20,187
- No?
- Heaslop? The Turtons?

1312
02:26:21,021 --> 02:26:24,400
She had the entire British Raj
behind her pushing her on.

1313
02:26:24,525 --> 02:26:29,154
But when she saw she was wrong, she
stopped and sent it all to smithereens.

1314
02:26:29,279 --> 02:26:31,865
I wouldn't have had the courage.

1315
02:26:35,619 --> 02:26:37,663
<i>(shouts in Urdu)</i>

1316
02:26:38,497 --> 02:26:40,541
Do you mind if I sit?

1317
02:26:41,417 --> 02:26:43,460
Please.

1318
02:26:48,757 --> 02:26:50,175
What will you do now?

1319
02:26:50,300 --> 02:26:53,762
Hamidullah's giving me a victory party
with fireworks and music.

1320
02:26:53,887 --> 02:26:58,225
Good. But I meant later.
Now this dreadful business is over.

1321
02:26:58,559 --> 02:27:00,853
I shall look for another job.

1322
02:27:00,978 --> 02:27:06,734
Hundreds of miles from here
in an lndian state out of British lndia.

1323
02:27:07,943 --> 02:27:11,947
- And you?
- I shall go to England for a long leave.

1324
02:27:14,408 --> 02:27:17,870
Will you and she be going back
on the same boat?

1325
02:27:17,995 --> 02:27:22,916
No. I couldn't possibly get away
before the end of next term.

1326
02:27:23,042 --> 02:27:26,962
Miss Quested is going
as soon as she can get a passage.

1327
02:27:27,087 --> 02:27:29,131
I see.

1328
02:27:34,303 --> 02:27:36,513
- Look...
- I'm looking.

1329
02:27:37,556 --> 02:27:42,061
Godbole tells me that Amritrao
is asking 20,000 rupees damages.

1330
02:27:42,186 --> 02:27:44,063
And costs.

1331
02:27:44,188 --> 02:27:47,733
I'd hate to see her getting
the worst of both worlds. It'll ruin her.

1332
02:27:47,858 --> 02:27:54,239
And me? Prison,
my private letters read out in court,

1333
02:27:55,032 --> 02:27:58,702
my wife's photograph taken to
the station to be fingered by McBryde,

1334
02:27:58,827 --> 02:28:01,872
all because a girl "fresh from England"
got too much sun.

1335
02:28:01,997 --> 02:28:03,540
I know.

1336
02:28:03,665 --> 02:28:06,919
And I know what you're going to ask next.

1337
02:28:07,044 --> 02:28:14,093
You're going to ask me to let her off
paying 20,000 rupees, right?

1338
02:28:16,053 --> 02:28:21,350
Then, if I agree,
the English will be able to say

1339
02:28:21,475 --> 02:28:25,062
"Here is an lndian that almost
behaved like a gentleman."

1340
02:28:25,187 --> 02:28:28,691
"But for the colour of his face,
we might even let him join the club."

1341
02:28:28,816 --> 02:28:31,360
ls that why you came here to see me?

1342
02:28:33,570 --> 02:28:35,906
Answer me.

1343
02:28:37,074 --> 02:28:40,077
In the end, you English
always stick together.

1344
02:28:41,036 --> 02:28:44,373
I want to have nothing more
to do with any of you.

1345
02:28:44,498 --> 02:28:46,500
Any of you!

1346
02:28:47,126 --> 02:28:50,587
You can go back to the college
and tell her to keep the money.

1347
02:28:50,713 --> 02:28:54,591
Tell her to use it to buy herself
a husband! Tell her...

1348
02:28:56,510 --> 02:28:57,928
<i>(speaks Urdu)</i>

1349
02:28:58,053 --> 02:29:00,097
<i>(festive music )</i>

1350
02:29:11,984 --> 02:29:14,194
<i>(cheering)</i>

1351
02:29:22,870 --> 02:29:25,080
Are you coming with me?

1352
02:29:25,205 --> 02:29:27,791
I don't think so.

1353
02:32:02,071 --> 02:32:05,407
<i>(both speak Urdu)</i>

1354
02:32:07,159 --> 02:32:10,204
This is a great honour, Professor.

1355
02:32:10,329 --> 02:32:12,373
- Anything wrong?
- No, no.

1356
02:32:17,378 --> 02:32:20,798
They arrive at the state guest house
this afternoon.

1357
02:32:22,257 --> 02:32:24,968
How long have you known
they were coming?

1358
02:32:25,094 --> 02:32:27,888
One month, possibly two.

1359
02:32:28,764 --> 02:32:31,850
- Why did you not tell me?
- One cannot tell anyone anything

1360
02:32:31,975 --> 02:32:34,353
unless they are ready to hear it.

1361
02:32:34,478 --> 02:32:36,522
And what does that mean?

1362
02:32:36,647 --> 02:32:41,110
Mr Fielding wrote you letters from
London and Bombay. You tore them up.

1363
02:32:41,735 --> 02:32:44,863
- I did.
- That is my point.

1364
02:32:48,659 --> 02:32:52,287
"My dear Aziz,
I have some news for you."

1365
02:32:52,413 --> 02:32:55,165
"I am going to marry
someone whom you know."

1366
02:32:55,290 --> 02:32:57,918
The end of a foolish experiment.

1367
02:32:58,043 --> 02:33:02,631
I have made a new life for myself
up here... away from the English.

1368
02:33:02,923 --> 02:33:06,301
I shall be going to
the guest house to greet them.

1369
02:33:06,427 --> 02:33:12,975
But my religious duties will be claiming
my full attention for the next three days.

1370
02:33:14,685 --> 02:33:17,229
He's come all this way to find you.

1371
02:33:18,772 --> 02:33:22,443
Can you not let bygones be bygones
and show them around?

1372
02:33:22,568 --> 02:33:25,654
I'm sorry, but I've had enough
of showing Miss Quested lndia.

1373
02:33:37,166 --> 02:33:39,209
Stop. Let's stop for a moment.

1374
02:34:36,058 --> 02:34:37,643
We must be getting on.

1375
02:35:50,716 --> 02:35:52,593
Houseboat, sahib.

1376
02:35:54,595 --> 02:35:56,638
Hello!

1377
02:35:57,931 --> 02:35:59,683
Aziz!

1378
02:36:19,244 --> 02:36:22,122
Well, here you are at last.

1379
02:36:22,247 --> 02:36:24,708
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1380
02:36:30,798 --> 02:36:32,633
Akbar! Jamila!

1381
02:36:35,552 --> 02:36:37,888
Your children?

1382
02:36:38,013 --> 02:36:40,224
Yes.

1383
02:36:40,349 --> 02:36:43,018
I suppose Godbole told you I was here.

1384
02:36:43,143 --> 02:36:47,481
The minister of education never tells
anyone anything unless he has to.

1385
02:36:47,606 --> 02:36:53,362
His only piece of information was that
the high school was destined not to be.

1386
02:36:53,487 --> 02:36:56,156
I was supposed to inspect it.

1387
02:36:56,281 --> 02:36:58,325
Anyhow, here I am.

1388
02:37:02,121 --> 02:37:05,416
I've been visiting schools
all over the country.

1389
02:37:05,541 --> 02:37:10,421
We called in at Chandrapore.
Your bungalow's been turned into a shop.

1390
02:37:11,422 --> 02:37:15,676
Turton's retired and
Callendar's been given the push.

1391
02:37:15,801 --> 02:37:18,679
And Hamidullah sends his salaams.

1392
02:37:19,054 --> 02:37:21,473
It was he who told me
you'd moved up here.

1393
02:37:21,598 --> 02:37:24,184
So I wrote, care of Godbole.

1394
02:37:26,020 --> 02:37:28,063
Why didn't you answer my letters?

1395
02:37:28,188 --> 02:37:31,316
You married my enemy,
stole my money.

1396
02:37:36,155 --> 02:37:39,241
Aziz, I'm going to surprise you.

1397
02:37:41,201 --> 02:37:45,039
- What do you mean?
- My wife is Mrs Moore's daughter.

1398
02:37:48,751 --> 02:37:51,754
- Stella?
- Stella.

1399
02:37:51,879 --> 02:37:54,340
Miss Quested introduced us.

1400
02:38:05,142 --> 02:38:07,186
What a blunder.

1401
02:38:08,771 --> 02:38:11,565
- Where is she?
- I left her at the guest house.

1402
02:38:11,690 --> 02:38:15,152
You'll meet her tomorrow.
She mustn't do too much just now.

1403
02:38:18,113 --> 02:38:20,282
She is carrying your child?

1404
02:38:20,407 --> 02:38:22,451
Yes.

1405
02:38:23,243 --> 02:38:26,497
So after all,
your name will not die out.

1406
02:38:27,373 --> 02:38:29,416
That's right.

1407
02:38:33,253 --> 02:38:35,297
Mrs Moore.

1408
02:38:37,140 --> 02:38:39,101
Mrs Moore!

1409
02:39:05,369 --> 02:39:10,290
<i>"And Stella believes the evil
of the Marabar has been wiped out,</i>

1410
02:39:10,416 --> 02:39:12,459
<i>and so do I."</i>

1411
02:39:15,921 --> 02:39:18,465
<i>"Dear Miss Quested,</i>

1412
02:39:21,176 --> 02:39:23,887
<i>tonight is the Festival of Light,</i>

1413
02:39:24,013 --> 02:39:27,725
<i>and I am writing this
to ask You to forgive me."</i>

1414
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:32,271
<i>"It has taken all this time for me
to appreciate Your courage."</i>

1415
02:39:33,522 --> 02:39:39,111
<i>"Because of You, I am happy here
with my children instead of in prison."</i>

1416
02:39:39,945 --> 02:39:44,575
<i>"And because of You,
I want to do kind actions all round."</i>

1417
02:39:48,829 --> 02:39:52,166
<i>"Richard and Stella left this morning."</i>

1418
02:40:21,653 --> 02:40:23,697
Goodbye.

1419
02:41:02,069 --> 02:41:05,322
<i>"I do not think I will ever see them again."</i>
