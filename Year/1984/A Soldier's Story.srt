Hey, sarge.

30
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,472
He's so drunk.

31
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,943
Oh, what a shame, he's drunk.

00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,945

00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:07,121
They still hate you.

46
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,536
You can put your arms down when the
search team finishes with you.

47
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:52,708
We don't want anybody from this fort
going into Tynin looking for rednecks.

48
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,002
- May I speak, sir?
- Cobb?

49
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,047
Nivens must know nobody
colored killed the sarge.

50
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,174
Well, this is
precautionary, Cobb.

51
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,594
We can't have the Army
engaged in revenge on civilians.

52
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,431
Sir. Are there any suspects, sir?
None.

53
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,435
Oh, come on, now. Everybody
knows it was the Klan.

54
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,563
Were you
an eyewitness, soldier?

55
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,983
They lynched Jefferson
the week I got here.

56
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,193
Two weeks after that, it was...
Henson.

57
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,196
Unless you saw it,
keep your opinions to yourself.

58
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,990
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,827
And that applies
to everybody else.

60
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,328
Yes, sir.

61
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,498
Tynin has been placed off-limits
to all enlisted personnel.

62
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,585
Oh, come on, captain.
Any man found in the town

63
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,672
will be immediately subject
to court-martial.

64
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,968
Sergeant Waters' replacement will
be assigned in a couple of weeks.

65
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,806
Until then, Cobb,
you're barracks NCO.

66
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,891
Any questions?

67
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,270
Carry on.

68
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,444
Now, what you think?

69
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,072
Taylor and that goddamn colonel,
they know who killed Waters.

70
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,783
Anybody feel like playing
me in some pitty-pat?

71
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,119
I thought all you could
play was flunky.

72
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,412
Yeah.

73
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,332
Wilkie, whose ass you gonna kiss now
that your number one ass is dead?

74
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,669
You know what you can do for me, Henson.
You too, Peterson.

75
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,881
Take it easy.
I'm the one who lost three stripes.

76
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,551
I'm the only man here with kids.
When the man said jump, I jumped.

77
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:29,305
Come on, don't put your wife and
kids between you and Waters' ass.

78
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,892
I don't kiss nobody's ass, Henson.
I just wanted my stripes back.

79
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,186
Never been no place,
never had nothing.

80
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:40,066
You can't understand a man like me.
I was a top sergeant of this platoon.

81
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:44,570
Yeah? Well, now you ain't nothing.
Nothing, Wilkie.

82
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,011
- Recruits, over here.
- Let me see your passes.

83
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,347
Let's go. Let's go.

84
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,149
Hey, wake up. Wake up, boy.

85
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,068
You said Tynin, didn't you?

86
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,404
Yeah, yeah. Ahem. Yeah.

87
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,698
Come on, boy.

88
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,451
Let's go.

89
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,538
- Hang on.
- Here we go again.

90
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,414
I'm from Mississippi.

91
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,811
Captain Davenport?

92
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,359
Corporal Ellis
at your disposal, sir.

93
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,154
I'm to take you
to Colonel Nivens, sir.

94
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:12,199
Well, let's get rolling, soldier.
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,210
Yes, sir, Captain Davenport.
Yes, sir.

96
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,213
We're rolling, captain.

97
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,635
This is where they killed
Sergeant Waters last month, sir.

98
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,764
Why did you say "they"
killed him, corporal?

99
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,352
- Who's "they"?
- The Klan, sir.

100
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,813
They ain't too crazy about us
tan yanks down here.

101
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,596
I suppose whoever drove
you in from the station

102
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,557
showed you the spot
where the killing took place.

103
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,895
Told you I had all the troops'
personal effects searched for weapons.

104
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,483
He tell you all that?

105
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,778
Is there a point the colonel
is trying to make, sir?

106
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,947
There's a point.

107
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,327
This thing has been blown
all the hell out of shape.

108
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,496
This is the Army's business.

109
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,873
Not the NAACP.

110
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,834
Not the Negro press.

111
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,713
Not those paper-shuffling
desk jockeys in Washington.

112
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,383
I was brought up
in the South, Davenport.

113
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,802
Ever hear of
Threadgill County, Alabama?

114
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,805
No, sir.

115
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,475
No matter.

116
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:49,273
I've been commanding colored
troops all my life, Davenport.

117
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,818
The worst thing you can do
in this part of the country

118
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:57,364
is pay attention to death of a Negro
under mysterious circumstances.

119
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,158
Especially a soldier.

120
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,244
People get itchy. Uneasy.

121
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:06,123
White folk in the town,
colored at the fort.

122
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,084
Keep turning this thing over,

123
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:13,213
sooner or later, you're bound
to have an explosion.

124
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:19,303
Now, I've lived here
in Hunter Parish three years.

125
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,930
I'm fond of the place.

126
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,724
I like the duty.

127
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,351
You get my meaning?

128
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,311
What is it you want, colonel?

129
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,814
I want whatever you came here
to do completed in three days.

130
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,525
Sir, I request permission
to notify Washington.

131
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,652
Denied.
I'm under direct orders...

132
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,238
I don't give a damn
if Roosevelt sent you.

133
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,993
I'm trying to prevent my troops from
going into town and killing somebody.

134
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,704
And I don't care what you think.

135
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,040
You can always return
to Washington.

136
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,249
No, sir.

137
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,545
I was assigned this case
and I intend to file a report, sir.

138
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,386
Here are your instructions
and our reports.

139
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,596
Taylor's men
will help you get settled.

140
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,932
Taylor was Waters' CO.

141
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,725
That'll be all, Davenport.

142
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,069
Oh, and, captain?

143
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,321
Remember,

144
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,866
you're the first colored officer
most of these men have seen.

145
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:27,162
The Army expects you to set
an example for the colored troops

146
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,748
and be a credit to your race.

147
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,794
Is that clear, captain?

148
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,965
Yes, colonel.

149
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,596
Sir.

150
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,516
Sir, you all right?

151
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,019
You like to go to your quarters?
No, I'll see Captain Taylor.

152
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,440
You don't wanna unpack, sir?
Freshen up? Didn't go too good?

153
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,444
You got a hearing problem?
No, sir. I was born with big ears.

154
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,572
It runs in my family.
My grandmother had big ears...

155
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,178
I used to drive
a fire truck, captain.

156
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,598
Then the Army took and let
me drive an ambulance.

157
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,893
I've been driving this jeep
for six months, sir.

158
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,520
Only turned over twice.

159
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,523
- Twice?
- Yes, sir.

160
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,067
Good.

161
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,516
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, sir.

162
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,485
Sergeant Washington, sir.
Can I help you, captain?

163
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,904
Captain Davenport
to see Captain Taylor.

164
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,241
Just a moment, sir.

165
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,953
Yes?

166
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,164
There's a Captain Davenport
to see you, sir.

167
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,251
- Well, send him in.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,713
Every member of the lodge
is rooting for you, sir.

169
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,642
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

170
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,270
I like your flowers, captain.

171
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,400
Hey, where's he from?

172
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,443
He's from Washington, D.C.

173
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,612
He's here on special assignment.

174
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,072
Washington?

175
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,740
Yes, sir.

176
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,451
You gotta be shitting me.

177
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:17,499
So they assigned a lawyer
to the military police, eh?

178
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,210
Well, where did you graduate
law school?

179
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,379
Howard University.

180
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,381
Your parents rich or something?

181
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,883
No, my father's a mailman.

182
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,513
I graduated at the Point.

183
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,266
I didn't see any Negroes
at the Point.

184
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:39,605
In fact, I never saw a Negro
until I was, I think, 12 or 13.

185
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,648
Have you seen
my orders, captain?

186
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,360
Yes, as soon as Colonel
Nivens received them.

187
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:51,742
Look, I think it only fair to tell you
that had I known you'd be a Negro

188
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,912
I would've requested the immediate
suspension of the investigation.

189
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,583
Now, look, may I speak freely?
You haven't stopped yet.

190
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,962
Look, these local people aren't
gonna charge a white man

191
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,922
in this parish on your say-so.

192
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,633
And Nivens knows that.

193
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,470
He doesn't give a damn about this killing.
Your being here proves it.

194
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,807
Making a fool out of you. Can't you...?
Will you take off those sunglasses?

195
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,935
I like these.
They're like MacArthur's.

196
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,856
All right. Now, look. Let me
explain something to you.

197
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,941
You go near Tynin in uniform,

198
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,736
sounding white
and charging local people,

199
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,364
you're gonna wind up
just as dead as Waters.

200
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,825
This isn't Washington, Davenport.
I know where I am.

201
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,746
Do you know how many times I've asked
Nivens to look into this killing?

202
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,082
Every day since it happened.

203
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,585
Do you suspect someone?
Don't play lawyer with me, soldier.

204
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,880
With you on this case,
we are not gonna get anywhere.

205
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,675
Like it or not, captain.
I am all you've got.

206
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,511
Your orders instruct you
to cooperate.

207
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,350
Now, is there anything else?

208
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,396
- Ellis.
- Yes, sir.

209
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,607
Captain Davenport will need
some assistance with the men.

210
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,402
You'll excuse me, captain?
Oh, I'm glad I met you.

211
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,572
Captain.

212
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,420
I sure hope we get
to fight soon, sir.

213
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,339
Next, they'll have us picking
this year's cotton crop.

214
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,634
Don't worry, they don't grow
a lot of cotton in Germany.

215
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,636
Yes, sir.

216
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,600
How long was Captain Taylor's
investigation?

217
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,018
Two days, sir.

218
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,771
Two days? Who did he question?

219
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,024
Well, mostly guys who had
contact with sarge that day.

220
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,820
Guys in his platoon, then anybody
who could've seen him on the road.

221
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,447
Wasn't but a handful.

222
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,324
- Did you see him that day?
- Nope.

223
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,493
No, sir.

224
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,981
Did your sergeant drink a lot?
I didn't know him well enough, sir.

225
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,234
All right, soldiers, let's
get back to those exercises.

226
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,904
Haven't you ever seen
a colored officer before?

227
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,531
No, sir. Have you, sir?

228
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,659
Ten-hut.

229
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,709
This is it, sir.

230
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,671
The captain instructed everyone in
the sergeant's platoon to be here.

231
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,509
As you were.

232
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,064
Sergeant Waters' room
is right there, sir.

233
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,568
Sir, I think I ought to tell you, sir.

234
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:18,198
Captain Taylor questioned two white
officers from this fort that night.

235
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,866
How do you know?

236
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,452
I delivered his report
to Colonel Nivens, sir.

237
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,122
And on the way over,
the jeep hit a hole, bam!

238
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,667
And the papers
flew all over the road

239
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,711
and I happened to notice it, sir.
Who are they?

240
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,004
No names, sir.

241
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,298
Just the mentioning
of the questioning.

242
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,551
Seems they were
on the road that night.

243
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:50,021
Well, don't let any more reports
fly away from you, corporal.

244
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,982
No, sir.

245
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,319
Sir, may I say something,
though?

246
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:01,241
It sure is good seeing one of
us wearing captain's bars, sir.

247
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,202
Call in the first man, corporal.

248
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,288
Yes, sir.

249
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,249
Private Wilkie,
captain wants to see you.

250
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,878
Yes, indeedy. On my way.

251
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,550
Private Wilkie
reports as ordered, sir.

252
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,052
Close the door.

253
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,230
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,195
I'm Captain Davenport. I'm conduc...
We all know that, sir.

255
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,575
Word went out on the grapevine you
were here the minute you hit the fort.

256
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,792
I'm conducting an inquiry into the
events surrounding the death of Waters.

257
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,754
The report I file
will be confidential.

258
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,798
How long did you know
the sergeant?

259
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,301
About a year, sir.

260
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,846
You see, this company, sir,
was basically a baseball team.

261
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,766
Most of the guys had played
in the Negro league.

262
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,143
Naturally,
the Army put us all together.

263
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,105
The Army sent Sergeant Waters here
to manage the team, summer of '42,

264
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,650
right after the invasion
of North Africa.

265
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,070
He'd been in field artillery,
a gunnery sergeant.

266
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,948
He had a FEF and an ETO.

267
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,409
A Croix de Guerre
from the First World War.

268
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,579
What kind of man was he?

269
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,837
He was all spit and polish, sir.

270
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,716
He took my stripes, sir,
but I was in the wrong.

271
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,510
Sergeant Wilkie.

272
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,180
You're a noncommissioned officer
in the army of a country at war.

273
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,308
Penalty for being drunk on duty
is severe in peace time.

274
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:55,105
So don't bring me, "Us colored folks
can't do nothing unless they're drunk."

275
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,273
You're supposed to be
an example.

276
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:01,486
I'm gonna put you in the stockade
for 10 days and take those stripes.

277
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,822
Wait, sergeant...
To teach you a lesson.

278
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,615
You're in the Army.

279
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,869
Colored folks running off
at the mouth.

280
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,873
What will they do if the white man
give them a chance? What do you do?

281
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,836
You wind up drunk on guard duty.
I don't blame the white man.

282
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,880
Why the hell should he put
colored and white together?

283
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,925
You can't guard your own quarters.
Sergeant...

284
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:28,179
Where's your pride, soldier? Where's
your respect for this uniform?

285
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,850
Get out of my sight, private.

286
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,247
And how was he
with the other men?

287
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,833
Sometimes the Southern
guys caught hell.

288
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,378
Sergeant wasn't too big
on guys from the South.

289
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,840
Me, I'm from Detroit.

290
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,052
Did you know that Joe Louis
got his start in Detroit?

291
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,304
What about the Southern men?

292
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,931
The sarge didn't like them.
Except for C.J.

293
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,643
It could've been because C.J. was
the best ballplayer on the team.

294
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,812
He could sing too.

295
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,190

Drink up. Drink up, y'all.

322
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:02,667
Drink up. Mary can't make no money when the U.S.
Army stops sipping.

323
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,836
So drink up now
because I need a new car.

324
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,132
Yeah.

325
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,468
I'm gonna ask that boy
something. Come on, Wilkie.

326
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,476
Hey, boy.

327
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,813
You ever heard
of Blind Willie Reynolds?

328
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,481
From Son House?

329
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,983
I knew it.

330
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,611
I bet you're from
Mississippi too, ain't you?

331
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,154
Yes, sir.

332
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:36,159
I used to hear him at the Bandana
Club outside Camp J.J. Reilly.

333
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,578
Folks used to come
from everywhere, Wilkie.

334
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,538
Folks would be
dancing, sweating.

335
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:44,250
Reminded me of a place
I used to go in France.

336
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,503
The whiskey, the women.

337
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:51,090
Place called the Café Napoléon.

338
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,011
Where did you learn to play, son?
My daddy taught me, sarge.

339
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,096
You play pretty good, boy.

340
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,433
Wilkie, wasn't that good?

341
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,644
Yeah, that was good, sarge.

342
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,729
Take it easy, son.

343
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,238
I mostly agreed with the sergeant, sir.
He was a good man.

344
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,198
Good to his men.

345
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,992
Talked about his wife
and his kid all the time.

346
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:21,454
As a matter of fact,
he wrote home to his wife every day.

347
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,208
I just don't see why anybody
would wanna kill the sarge.

My wife let a neighbor take this
just a couple of weeks ago.

352
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,642
Army's not for my son.

353
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,645
See, when this war is over,
things are gonna change.

354
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,189
I want him to be ready for it.

355
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,443
I'll send him to some big white college.
Let him rub elbows with the whites.

356
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,071
Learn white man's language,
how he does things.

357
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,240
White don't rub off.

358
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,743
Well, what are we gonna do?
Stay behind in everything?

359
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,956
Hell, you can see it in the Army
. White man's running rings around us.

360
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,293
Lot of us ain't had the chance
them white boys had, sarge.

361
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,836
Oh, that ain't no excuse.

362
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,714
My daddy shoveled coal
from a wagon all his life.

363
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,591
Couldn't read or write,
but he saw that we did.

364
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,303
Now, not having is no excuse
for not getting.

365
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,139
You can't get pee
from a tree, sarge.

- Take it easy.

369
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,781
All I said...
Is the equipment ready?

370
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,451

Mr. Warm and Mr. Cold.
But deep down, a real nice guy.

381
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,227
You could borrow a 10 from him
if you needed it.

382
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,064
Did you see him
the night he was killed?

383
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:15,026
I saw him in town at the club earlier.
But I left around 10:00.

384
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,195
He was juicing pretty heavy.

385
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,697
Is it true
that when they found him

386
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:23,368
his stripes and insignia
were still on the uniform?

387
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,830
Yes.
Something's wrong, ain't it, sir?

388
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,582
Those Klan boys,

389
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:33,002
they can't stand to see us
in these uniforms.

390
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,090
They usually take the stripes and
stuff off before they lynch us.

391
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,848
That'll be all, private.
Yes, sir.

392
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,728
Can you do anything
about allotment checks?

393
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,939
My wife didn't get hers
last month.

394
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,275
Did you see
the finance officer?

395
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,195
Yes, I did, sir.

396
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,032
Well, I'll speak
to Captain Taylor about it.

397
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,451
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Yes, indeed.

398
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,870
Would you like me
to send the next man in?

399
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,747
Yes.

400
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,755
Private First Class Melvin Peterson,
reporting as ordered, sir.

401
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,467
Sit down, private.

402
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,982
Where are you from, Peterson?

403
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,443
Hollywood, California.

404
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,612
By way of Alabama, sir.

405
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:45,992
You see, I enlisted in '42. I thought
we'd get a chance to fight, sir.

406
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,291
Did you know the sergeant well?

407
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,335
No. He was with the company
when I got assigned,

408
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,464
and PFCs and sergeants,
we don't mix too well, sir.

409
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,468
You played ball for him.
Oh, yes, sir. I played shortstop.

410
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,471
And did you like the sergeant?
No, sir.

411
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,515
Well, it goes back to the team.
Stoneass felt that...

412
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,142
Stoneass?

413
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,270
I'm the only one who called
him that. Sergeant Waters.

414
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,815
Didn't mean no offense, sir.

415
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,737
By the time I got here,

416
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,615
the team had won
nine or 10 games in a row.

417
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,660
There was even a rumor we'd get to
play the Yankees in exhibition.

418
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,787
Anyway, we were...

419
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,790
We were playing the 35th
Ordinance this particular day.

420
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,126
It was a real big game too.

421
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,631
The YWCA sent a whole
busload of women to see us.

422
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,218
Yes, a real big day, sir.

423
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,658
I can't believe that.

424
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,245
Yeah.

425
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,417
Let it fly again. Let's go, Pete.

426
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,110
Come on, batter. Hit the ball.

427
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,447
That's a hell of a ballplayer.

428
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,040
Come on, hit it.
Throw another one up here.

429
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,752
Come on, C.J., next county.

430
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,070
Hell of a ballplayer.
Did you see...?

431
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,205
- All right, C.J.
- Right on, C.J.

432
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,294
Come on, boy.

433
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,841
Did you see that ball?

434
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,177
Did you see it? Did you see it go?

435
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:57,266
We played fairly well. I had two hits.
Smalls had a couple and C.J...

436
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,269
C.J. was incredible.

437
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,732
And we beat them something
like nine-, 10-nothing.

438
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:09,111
Like we always did after, we went
over to the mess hall to celebrate.

439
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,156
Fellas.
It's a big ball, give it back.

440
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:18,412
C.J. Who was that fine river hip thing
you was talking to before the game?

441
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,415
The woman had tits
like two helmets.

442
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,835
You see the size of them knockers?
No, he didn't.

443
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:27,630
Smalls couldn't even see
a ball go in his glove.

444
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,133
How the hell he gonna see C.J.?
I saw C.J., man.

445
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,929
Will you all let C.J. tell me
about this woman?

446
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,056
She looked mighty good
to me, C.J.

447
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,309
All she asked me for
was my autograph.

448
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,604
She looked like she was
asking for more than that.

449
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,898
Moved in close.

450
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,775
Breathing heavy.

451
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,904
Waving them tits
all in your face.

452
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,408
He's right on that, C.J.

453
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,993
If I'd given that gal
what she asked me for,

454
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,913
she'd give me something
I didn't want.

455
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,456
Around home,

456
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:06,544
there's a fella folks used to call
Little Jimmy One-Leg

457
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,213
on account of his thing
was so big.

458
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,926
A couple of years ago,
a young, pretty thing

459
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,387
laid clap on Jimmy so bad

460
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,848
he lost the one good leg he had.

461
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,850
Now folks just call him Little.

462
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,273
You know, that pretty young thing
talking to me ain't look too clean.

463
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:32,278
Yeah, them dirty ones will give you
the clap every time, right, Henson?

464
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:40,494
I hear tell they're on the verge
of getting all of us together.

465
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:44,123
The colored, the white,
say they want one army.

466
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,125
You can forget that, C.J.

467
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,128
White folks ain't never
gonna integrate no army.

468
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:54,008
I don't know. If they do,

This country is at war.

508
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,179
And you niggers are soldiers,
nothing else.

509
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,141
And something else.

510
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,437
From now on, when I tell you to
do something, I want it done.

511
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,732
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

512
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,861
Now get out of those
baseball uniforms.

513
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,406
I could smell you suckers
before I hit the door.

514
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:25,117
Hey, what kind of
colored man are you?

515
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,039
I'm a soldier, Peterson.

516
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,835
And the kind of colored man that
don't like lazy, shiftless Negroes.

517
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:38,297
Well, sir, you ain't got to
come in here calling us names.

518
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:41,133
The Nazis call you schwarze.

519
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,427
You gonna complain to Hitler
he hurt your feelings?

520
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:46,722
Don't look like to me we could
do too much to them Nazis

521
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,682
with paintbrushes, sarge.

522
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,439
You trying to mock me, C.J.?

523
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:58,067
- No, sir, sarge.
- Good.

524
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,445
Because whatever an ignorant
Geechee like you has to say

525
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,823
ain't worth
paying attention to, is it?

526
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,993
Is it?

527
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,164
I reckon not, sarge.

528
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,087
You're a creep, Waters.

529
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,091
Sarge's just joking, Pete.
He don't mean no harm.

530
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,178
No, he does. I mean, we take
enough from them white boys.

531
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,556
Yes, you do.
If it wasn't for Southern niggers

532
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,351
white folks wouldn't think
we was all fools.

533
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,270
Well, where are you from,
England?

534
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,529
Wilkie.

535
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:48,701
Looks like we got us
a wiseass Alabama boy here.

536
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,704
Yes, sir.

537
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:56,375
Now, don't you get smart, nigger.
Get your fucking hands off me.

538
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,800
You wanna hit
old Sergeant Waters, boy?

539
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,178
Come on.

540
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,932
Please.

541
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,810
Come on, nigger.

542
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:16,979
Ten-hut.

543
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,399
At ease.

544
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,068
- What's going on here, sergeant?
- Nothing, sir.

545
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,947
I was going over
some batting techniques, sir.

546
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,742
Is there something you wanted?
Something I can do?

547
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,785
No, no, nothing.

548
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:35,873
I just wanted to congratulate you
men on the game you won today.

549
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,877
Now, the way I figure it,
only seven more

550
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:45,758
and we'll be the first colored team
in Army history to play the Yankees.

551
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,261
The entire regiment
is counting on you.

552
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,971
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

553
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:56,477
As far as I'm concerned, these men
can have the rest of the day off.

554
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,437
I beg your pardon, sir.

555
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,190
Excuse me, sir. These men
don't need time off.

556
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:05,360
They need work. Our fellas
in Africa aren't getting time off.

557
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,864
Besides, we have orders to report
for a paint detail at 1600.

558
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,158
Who issued that order?
Major Harris.

559
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,911
- I'll speak to the major.
- Sir?

560
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,750
I don't think it's a good idea to have a
colored NCO mixed up with your officers, sir.

561
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,878
I said I'd speak to him,
sergeant.

562
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,005
Yes, sir.

563
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:30,385
Memphis, about that catch
you made in center field today...

564
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,388
How in the hell
did you get up that high?

565
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:39,978
They say I got bird in my blood, sir.
I hope it's American eagle.

566
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,856
No, sir. Crow.

567
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:46,485
See, a man told my daddy
the day I was born.

568
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,655
He said, "The boy got the
shadow of crow in his chest..."

569
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,657
That's fine, Memphis.

570
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,744
Men, you played
a great game today.

571
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,497
- Sergeant?
- A-ten-hut.

572
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,958
Carry on.

573
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,503
Shadow of a crow.

574
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,630
- What do you say?
- Yeah, that's the...

575
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,595
How long a story were you gonna
tell the man there, C.J.?

576
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,686
Peterson. I ain't forgot you, boy.

577
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,188
It's time to teach you a lesson.

578
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,232
- Wilkie.
- Sir?

579
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,152
Go outside and make sure
everything is set up.

580
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,196
You want all the NCOs?

581
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,618
I'm going outside
and wait for you, Geechee.

582
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,745
And when you come out,

583
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,540
I'm gonna whup
your black Southern ass.

584
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,834
Let the whole company
watch too.

585
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,712
You need to learn respect
for these stripes.

586
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,885
The rest of you,

587
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:57,014
get those goddamn uniforms off
like I said.

588
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,185
You ain't gonna fight him,
are you?

589
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,521
Don't do it. He'll fight dirty.
You can't whup the sarge.

590
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:07,357
Well, you wanna fight
in my place, Cobb?

591
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,902
Shoot.

592
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,322
Pete. Pete, I got some
farmer's dust.

593
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,824
Just a pinch will make you
strong as a bull.

594
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,619
Would you get the hell
out of here with that crap?

595
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,705
You can't speak up. You let
him treat you like a dog.

596
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,707
Calling names
ain't nothing, Pete.

597
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:27,252
I know who I is. Sarge ain't so bad.
He's been good to me.

598
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,797
C.J., the man despises you.
You're wrong, Pete.

599
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,300
Plus, I feel sorry
for him myself.

600
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:38,138
Any man ain't sure where he belong
gotta be in a whole lot of pain.

601
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,975
Look, don't you all even care
about nothing?

602
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,977
Don't none of us like it, Pete.

603
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:47,898
But this is the Army
and sarge got all the stripes.

604
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:52,903
I'll go get the captain. You ain't got
to go out and get your head beaten in.

605
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,697
Well, somebody's
got to fight him.

606
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,158
Waters, what's going on?

607
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,494
I had a problem with one of the guys.

608
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,456
- Yeah?
- Don't worry about it.

609
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,460
Come on now, boy.

610
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,213
Let's take your
whupping like a man.

611
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,925
Kick his ass, Pete.
Watch him, Pete.

612
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,720
Yeah, come on out here
and kick old sarge's ass.

613
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,972
Come on, Geechee.

614
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,308
You don't want the sarge
to grow old waiting for you now.

615
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:37,990
Fight.

616
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,450
Fight him. Fight him. Grab him.

617
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,371
- Get him.
- Come on.

618
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,665
Come on. Come on.

619
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,132
Watch him, Pete.

620
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,306
He got him. That got him.

621
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,975
Come on. Get up. Get up, sarge.

622
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,062
You throw
a pretty mean punch, boy.

623
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,940
But old sarge is here
to kick your ass.

624
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,324
- Come on.
- Come on, Pete.

625
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:21,992
Move over there.

626
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,870
- There you go.
- Come on.

627
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:26,955
Who the hell is fighting over there?

628
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,251
- Come on.
- There you go.

629
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:34,421
- Get up, Pete.
- Get up, get up.

630
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,383
- Get him, sarge.
- Vernon. Vernon.

631
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,888
That's enough.

632
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:56,401
Yeah, he beat me
pretty bad that day, sir.

633
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:00,781
Did anybody report
the fight to an officer?

634
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,076
No, sir, I never reported it.
I know I should have,

635
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,704
but he left me alone after that
so I just played ball.

636
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,751
I appreciate your honesty,
Peterson.

637
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,003
Thank you, sir.

638
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:22,344
Did you see Sergeant Waters
the night he was killed?

639
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,639
No, sir. Smalls and I
had guard duty.

640
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,103
Thank you. That'll be all for now.
Yes, sir.

641
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:36,400
Did the team ever get
to play the Yankees?

642
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:40,570
No, sir. We lost the last game
to a sanitation company.

643
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,146
What brings you out to my
neighborhood, captain?

644
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,731
Slumming?

645
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,900
I wanted you to see the request

646
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:46,029
I've sent to Colonel Nivens to have
your investigation terminated.

647
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:49,491
Now, my reasons have nothing
to do with you personally.

648
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,035
My request won't hurt
your career in any way.

649
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:55,539
It's just that there are other
things to consider in this case.

650
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,374
Only the color of my skin.

651
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,918
Now, hold it, Davenport.

652
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,671
I want the people that
killed Waters prosecuted.

653
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,965
- So do I.
- Then give this up.

654
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,718
White people down here, they
won't see their duty or justice.

655
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:12,389
They'll see you. And you can't
possibly get at the truth.

656
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:16,685
Why? Because two white
officers are involved in this?

657
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,522
And you can't get them charged,
court-martialed or anything else.

658
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,733
Why wasn't there any mention
of them in my report?

659
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,945
You think I'm gonna let you
get away with this?

660
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,910
I was ordered not
to include it.

661
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:37,998
- By who?
- Colonel Nivens.

662
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,419
Now, look,

663
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:47,549
they took two .45-caliber slugs
out of Waters, Army issue.

664
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,136
Now, if my men thought
a white officer had killed him,

665
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,305
there would have been
a slaughter.

666
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,474
Who are the officers?

667
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,228
Lieutenant Byrd in Ordnance
and a Captain Wilcox,

668
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,397
12th Hospital Group.

669
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,899
Private Seymour saw them
on the road.

670
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,361
When I checked the officers'
billet, I found them both asleep.

671
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,740
They admitted they'd had an
argument with the sergeant...

672
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,200
but said they'd left him
on the road.

673
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,287
So you never believed
the Klan was involved.

674
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,165
No. No.

675
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,168
Now can you see why this
thing needs somebody else?

676
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,173
Tell me what they told you.

677
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,802
Look, hotshot,

678
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,181
they're not gonna let you
charge those two men.

679
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,101
Tell me what they told you.

680
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,522
Left, hup, three, four.

681
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,332
Left, hup, three, four.

682
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:01,206
Left, two, three, four.

683
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:11,132
You wanna move your ass off
the goddamn road, sergeant?

684
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,886
Well, I'll be damned.

685
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:18,390
If it ain't the white boys.

686
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,017
Did you hear what he said?

687
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:22,310
- Shit.
- Let it go.

688
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,897
Let it go my ass.
Come here, sergeant.

689
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:31,319
White boys,
all starched and stiff.

690
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:36,282
Want everybody to learn
that symphony shit.

691
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,035
That's what you said in France,

692
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:42,956
and, you know,
I listened to it.

693
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,291
Am I right, now? Am I?

694
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:48,211
You'd better straighten up
and salute an officer

695
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,588
or I'll take your
fucking stripes, boy.

696
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,133
That's better.

697
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:05,937
Well, look at the nigger.

698
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:09,941
You come to attention right now,
and that is an order.

699
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:14,654
I ain't doing nothing
white folks say do. No more.

700
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,948
No, leave him alone,
the man is drunk.

701
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:19,617
I want the nigger to
do like I tell him. Do it.

702
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,786
- No.
- I'll teach him, goddamn it.

703
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:24,205
I always mind y'all.

704
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,168
Look what it's done to me.

705
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,796
I hate myself.

706
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:35,008
Don't blame me. God's the one
who made you black, not me.

707
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,801
My daddy said,

708
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:41,014
"Don't talk like this,"

709
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,683
talk like that.

710
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,351
Don't say,

711
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,272
"Say..."

712
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,196
I even killed for you.

713
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,786
Stop!

714
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:07,415
You wanna kill him? The man is sick.
Let him go. You're gonna kill him.

715
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:12,086
Come on.

716
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,519
White men are killing for you,
nigger.

717
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,190
Good men dying for you.

718
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:42,283
So anyway, they said
they left Waters about 2310.

719
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:48,373
And everyone in the barracks
confirms that they were in by 2330

720
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,709
and that neither man left
till the following morning.

721
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:56,089
That's nothing but white officers
lying to protect two of their own.

722
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:57,757
You know that.

723
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:01,594
I'm arresting both of them, captain.
Consider yourself under arrest...

724
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:04,389
pending my charges against you.
What charges?

725
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:08,059
It was your duty to go over
Nivens' head if you had to.

726
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:11,062
Oh, you're gonna arrest
the colonel too, Davenport?

727
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,064
Because he's part
of their alibi.

728
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:16,526
He was there in the officers'
billet when they came in.

729
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,320
Played poker till 3:30
in the morning, yeah.

730
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:24,158
Yeah, the colonel, Major Hines
and four other white officers.

731
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,035
They're all lying.

732
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,621
You just go out and prove it.

733
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:48,016
Sir, I intend to arrest Lieutenant
Byrd and Captain Wilcox.

734
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,185
You will do nothing of the kind.
Colonel.

735
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:55,064
I believe these men had something
to do with Sergeant Waters' death.

736
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,818
No, I can't allow that.

737
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:02,155
You have no authority
to arrest white officers.

738
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,074
Then give me the authority, sir.

739
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,409
Colonel.

740
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,912
Your breakfast is ready.

741
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:12,874
Thank you, honey.

742
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,337
Can I have someone
fetch you coffee, captain?

743
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,173
No, thank you, ma'am.

744
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:27,096
I hope they're making your stay at
Fort Neal real comfortable, captain.

745
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:31,309
They're taking good care of me.
It's very thoughtful of you to ask.

746
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:34,979
Good morning.

747
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:37,357
No, I can't give you
that authority.

748
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,360
- I told you.
- 30.

749
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:41,736
I was there.

750
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:45,114
Now, you've read
our affidavits on this thing.

751
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,993
Colonel, what will the Army say
when they find out white officers

752
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,330
beat up the victim not long
before he was shot to death?

753
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,917
Their CO refuses to report
they had anything to do with it

754
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,962
and he signs an affidavit
supporting their alibi.

755
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:04,342
These two are our best suspects.
How can you not have them arrested

756
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,720
or at least questioned
by the investigating officer?

757
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,602
Something like this
is bound to get out.

758
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,190
I didn't say
you couldn't question them.

759
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,485
But I want
a white officer present.

760
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:25,238
And I want everything
that's said reported to me.

761
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,449
- Is that clear?
- Of course, sir.

762
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,586
You're dismissed, captain.
Yes, sir.

00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:31,072
Hey, Virge, same old sermon?

772
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:40,248
I didn't know you were
a religious man, Henson.

773
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,250
I'm not.

774
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,836
I just play this organ.

775
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:49,465
If I play on Sundays, I get out of a
few work details during the week.

776
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:50,675
That's all.

777
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,344
I wanna talk about Sergeant Waters.
Yeah?

778
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:58,808
There ain't much to talk about,
except for I didn't like the man myself

779
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,352
on account of
what he did to C.J.

780
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,187
What did he do?

781
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,106
I don't mean you no offense,

782
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,527
but I ain't exactly crazy
about talking to no officer.

783
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,529
Colored or white.

784
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,448
Oh, you're gonna talk, Henson.

785
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:18,202
You'll talk or I'll put your ass
in the stockade so long

786
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,204
you'll forget how to.

787
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:29,463
He was always on...

788
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,508
Always on C.J.'s back
about something.

789
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:36,721
Every little thing. Least ways,
that's how it seemed to me.

790
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,473
Then the shooting went down.
What shooting?

791
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:42,560
Well, the shooting over at
Williams' Golden Palace.

792
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:46,230
Happened just last year right at
the end of the baseball season.

793
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,193
A whole lot of shots had gone off
right near the barracks.

794
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:56,157
I had gone over and gotten a little
juiced at the Enlisted Men's Club.

795
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,536
Somebody's shooting.

796
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,997
They're shooting over there.

797
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,666
Everybody up. Wake them up, Wilkie.
Move it.

798
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,753
Come on, Un-ass them bunks.
Come on, you Geechees.

799
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,422
Off your asses, on your feet.
Everybody up.

800
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:14,091
- Let's go.
- What's going on, man?

801
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:17,553
Company, a-ten-hut.

802
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,223
There's been a shooting.

803
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:23,184
One of ours bucked the line
at Williams' pay phone

804
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:25,311
and three soldiers are dead.

805
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:28,481
Two colored, one white MP.

806
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,192
The man who bucked
the line, he killed the MP

807
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,612
and the white boys
started shooting everybody.

808
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,031
That's how our two got shot.

809
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:40,618
And this lowdown nigger we're
looking for got chased down here.

810
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:43,621
Was almost caught till
somebody in these barracks

811
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,540
started shooting at
the men chasing him.

812
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:53,673
So we got us a vicious, lowdown
murdering piece of black trash

813
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,925
in here somewhere.

814
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,970
And a few people
who helped him.

815
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,392
If any of you are in this,

816
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,729
I want you to step forward.

817
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,737
All you baseball niggers
are innocent?

818
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,572
- Wilkie.
- Sir.

819
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,575
Make the search.
Open those footlockers. Come on.

820
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,787
All right, Peterson, what are
you waiting for, an invitation?

821
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:30,042
Open them up. Spread them out.
I wanna see what's happening inside.

822
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:31,919
Memphis, you in this?

823
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,380
No, sir, sarge.

824
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,633
You heard what the sergeant said.

825
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,427
How many of you
were out tonight?

826
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:44,265
I was over at Williams' around about 7.
I got me a pack of Lucky Strikes.

827
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,810
- But I didn't try to call home, though.
- Got something.

828
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,947
Still warm.

829
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,574
C.J., is this yours?

830
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,577
You know it ain't mine, sarge.

831
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,871
Probably not.

832
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,498
Probably just crawled in
through a window,

833
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,752
passed everybody's bunk,
Peterson, Cobb,

834
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:15,254
and just snuggled up
under yours?

835
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:18,716
Must be voodoo, right, boy? Or
some of that farmer's dust.

836
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:23,137
That ain't mine, sarge. I hate guns.
Makes me feel bad just to see a gun.

837
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:25,473
Liar. Place this man
under arrest.

838
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,684
Look, sir, C.J. couldn't hurt a fly, sarge.
You know that.

839
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:31,687
I found a gun, soldier.
You know it ain't him.

840
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:35,399
Who is it then? You?
I saw somebody sneak in here.

841
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:39,153
You were drunk when you left the club.
Throw his ass in the shower.

842
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,947
Well, I was here all night.
C.J. ain't go nowhere.

843
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,949
He was asleep
before I got to bed.

844
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,452
Oh, you think he's innocent?

845
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,413
C.J. Memphis,

846
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:53,042
playing cotton picker,
singing the blues,

847
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,629
bowing and scraping,
smiling in white folks' faces.

848
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,633
This man undermined us.
You and me. Everybody.

849
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,511
That "yes, sir, boss"
is hiding something.

850
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,599
Are we like that today, in 1944?
He shot that white boy.

851
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,900
What are you going to
do now, boy?

852
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,823
Hit a noncommissioned officer.

853
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:27,201
Well, C.J. just lost his head...
Shut up.

854
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,286
Get him out of here.

855
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:48,305
Sarge, I know I saw somebody.

856
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,643
Smalls, I saw somebody, I did.

857
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:55,813
Oh, C.J. was sleeping
when I came in.

858
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:59,066
Well, it's Waters.
Can't y'all see that?

859
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,411
You know, I seen them before.

860
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,038
Yeah, we had them in Alabama.

861
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,958
White man give him
a little-ass job as a servant,

862
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:18,210
and when the boss
ain't looking,

863
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:21,297
that old copycat nigger
act like he the new boss.

864
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,757
Shouting,
ordering people around.

865
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,804
You see, arresting C.J.,
that'll get Waters another stripe.

866
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:31,140
Yeah.
Next, it'll be you or you.

867
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,810
You see, he can't look good
unless he's standing on you.

868
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,146
Cobb told him C.J.
was here all evening.

869
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,106
Waters didn't even listen,
did he?

870
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,109
Turning somebody in.

871
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,945
"Yeah, look what I done,
captain, boss."

872
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:49,033
Only reason they let him in is they
know he'll do what they tell him to.

873
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,619
See, I've seen
this kind of fool before, boy.

874
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,413
Yeah, somebody's gonna
kill him one of these days.

875
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,124
I heard they killed a sergeant
at Fort Robinson.

876
01:03:57,334 --> 01:04:00,085
- A recruit did it.
- Forget it, Pete.

877
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:04,215
Our luck, sarge will come through
the war, won't even get a scratch.

878
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,300
Yeah, maybe,

879
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,719
but I'm going over
to them stockades.

880
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,638
Tell them MPs what I know.

881
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,015
C.J. was in here all evening.

882
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,725
I'm gonna go with you.

883
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,521
Y'all wait up. I'm coming too.

884
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:23,025
Was Wilkie the only person
out of his bunk?

885
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,654
I guess.
Wilkie came in with the sarge.

886
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,364
But it's hard to say.

887
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:33,327
It's been a while and like I said,
I was a little juiced that night.

888
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:39,208
- Ellis.
- Yes? Yes, sir?

889
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,836
Find out what's holding up my
investigation of Wilcox and Byrd.

890
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:45,047
Yes, sir.

891
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:51,595
The night Sergeant Waters
was killed, where were you?

892
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,389
I was in the barracks.

893
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:58,310
I played checkers with Cobb
till 9:30 and then I went to bed.

894
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:05,609
Is there gonna be
anything else, sir?

895
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,237
Dismissed, private.

896
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,214
Let her go.

897
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,634
Let me know when it's full board.
Here we go. Let's go, baby.

898
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:33,679
- Pick it up.
- Keep your rifles up.

899
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,265
That's it.

900
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:42,187
That's it, move out! Move out!
Move your ass!

901
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,108
That's it, move out! Move out!

902
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:55,492
Goddamn it, get going!
That's it, that's it, move it out!

903
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:01,123
- Shake it out! Hit that wall!
- Get your feet up!

904
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,334
Hurry it up! Hurry it up!

905
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:06,545
Move out! Move out! That's it!

906
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,424
- Watch it!
- Shake your ass! That's it!

907
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:12,217
Move it out!

908
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,306
Move it! Let's go!

909
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,476
Ellis!

910
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,063
Ellis!

911
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,361
Hold it!

912
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:34,865
- Stop shooting!
- Stop shooting!

913
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,715
Which one of you idiots
is Cobb?

914
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,598
That's me, sir.

915
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,892
You all right, captain?

916
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:05,020
I wanna talk to you.

917
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,564
What'd he want old Cobb for?

918
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,109
I don't know.

919
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:12,194
What'd he ask you, Pete?

920
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:15,948
He just asked a couple of questions
about the baseball game...

921
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,533
some about the sarge.

922
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,326
Didn't amount to too much.

923
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:22,496
Yeah, we was homeys, me and
C.J., both from Mississippi.

924
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:23,789
C.J., from Carmella.

925
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:27,584
Me, I'm from up around Jutlerville,
what they call Snake County.

926
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,504
How did you feel when your
best friend was arrested?

927
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,006
I hated Waters for it, sir.
Hated?

928
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,676
C.J. ain't killed nobody.

929
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:39,263
He hit Waters, didn't he?
Yeah, but the sergeant made him, sir.

930
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:42,516
He called that boy things
he ain't never heard before.

931
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:45,936
C.J. was from the farm,
a country boy.

932
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:50,023
That jail cell started doing
crazy things to C.J., sir.

933
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,651
It started closing in on him.

934
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,461
Are you all right?

935
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,760
It's hard to breathe
in these little spaces, Cobb.

936
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,765
What they doing to you
in here, C.J.?

937
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:27,811
Man wasn't made for this here.

938
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:31,774
Nothing was.

939
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,112
Don't think I'll ever see
an animal in a cage again

940
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,615
and not feel sorry for it.

941
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,742
Rather be on a chain gang.

942
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,119
Oh, come on, homey.

943
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:47,956
Don't think I'm getting
out of here, Cobb.

944
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,793
Feel like I'm going crazy.

945
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:52,878
Can't walk in here.

946
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,922
Can't see the sun.

947
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:59,760
I tried to sing,
but nothing won't come out.

948
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:03,764
Yesterday, I broke a guitar string.

949
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:09,436
And I lost my dust.

950
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,147
Got no protection, Cobb.

951
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:15,776
Nothing to keep the dogs
from tearing at my bones.

952
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,987
C.J., stop talking crazy.

953
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:25,536
You know who come up here
last night?

954
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,542
Sergeant Waters.

955
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,884
They talking about
giving you five years.

956
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,808
They call what you did
mutiny, boy.

957
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,185
That gun ain't mine.

958
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:52,521
We know that, C.J.

959
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,399
We changed the charge
on you this morning.

960
01:09:56,442 --> 01:10:00,779
You're in here for striking
a superior officer, boy.

961
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,991
And everybody seen it too.

962
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:07,703
Why are you doing this to me,
sarge?

963
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,706
Oh, don't feel too bad, C.J.

964
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:13,125
It has to be this way.

965
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:16,461
You see,

966
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:21,216
the first war didn't change
nothing for the Negro.

967
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:25,846
But this one,
gonna change everything.

968
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:29,016
Them Nazis ain't all crazy.

969
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:34,229
Whole lot of people just can't seem to
fit in to where things seem to be going.

970
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:36,815
Like you, C.J.

971
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:42,070
See, the black race
can't afford you no more.

972
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:46,116
Oh, there used to be a time
we'd see somebody like you

973
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,244
singing, clowning,
"yes, sir, boss" ing,

974
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:51,496
and we wouldn't do anything.

975
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,624
Folks liked that.

976
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,459
You were good.

977
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,628
Homey kind of nigger.

978
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,673
When they needed somebody
to mistreat, call a name or two,

979
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,800
they paraded you.

980
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,763
Reminded them
of the good old days.

981
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,769
Not no more.

982
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,814
The day of the Geechee
is gone, boy.

983
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:19,983
And you're going with it.

984
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:25,614
We can't let nobody go on believing
we're all fools like you.

985
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,249
I waited a long time
for you, boy.

986
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,710
But I got you.

987
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,089
I put two Geechees in jail
in Camp Campbell, Kentucky.

988
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,132
Three in Fort Huachuca.

989
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,970
Now I've got you.

990
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:52,933
One less fool for the race
to be ashamed of.

991
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,638
What happened to him?

992
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,350
C.J. killed himself, sir.

993
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:41,356
The day after I saw him, the MPs
found him hanging from the bars.

994
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,235
We lost our last game.

995
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,279
We just threw it.

996
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,531
We did it for C.J.

997
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:54,036
Captain Taylor was mad because we
ain't get to play the Yankees.

998
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:57,914
Peterson was right on that one.
We needed to protest that man.

999
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,757
And the sergeant,
what did he do?

1000
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,633
Well, they broke up the team

1001
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:12,637
and they assigned us to this here
smoke-generating company.

1002
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:16,308
And the sarge,
he just started acting funny.

1003
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,935
He stayed drunk all the time.

1004
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:21,521
What time did you get in
the night he was killed?

1005
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,274
Between 2120 and 9:30.

1006
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:27,277
Me and Henson listened
to The Jack Benny show,

1007
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:31,531
played checkers.
Who was the last man in that night?

1008
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,076
Peterson and Smalls.
They had guard duty, sir.

1009
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,789
Is that it, captain?
Thank you, corporal.

1010
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,582
Yes, sir.

1011
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:51,426
Eight ball, corner pocket.

1012
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,308
Whose idea was this, Charlie?
Nivens.

1013
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:02,270
And you have to clear the area, Jim.
We're here to question these two.

1014
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,483
He's got no business in here.
Take it up with the colonel.

1015
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:14,616
Now, this is Captain Davenport.

1016
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:19,412
You both understand, you're to give
the captain your full cooperation.

1017
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:22,249
You're a lawyer?

1018
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,293
I'm not here to answer
your questions, lieutenant.

1019
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:31,341
Sit down.

1020
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,219
Yes, sir.

1021
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:41,935
When did you last see Waters?
Same night somebody killed him.

1022
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:46,481
Course, I should've done it myself by
the way he spoke to Wilcox and me.

1023
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,733
How did he speak
to you, captain?

1024
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:52,320
Well, he was drunk. He said a
few things he shouldn't have.

1025
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:56,241
I told the lieutenant not to make
the situation any worse than it was.

1026
01:14:56,450 --> 01:15:00,954
So we just left him there, on the
side of the road, on his knees.

1027
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:02,956
Alive.

1028
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:06,793
Exactly what did he say?

1029
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:11,173
He said he wasn't gonna obey
the white man's orders anymore.

1030
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:14,509
And he starts blaming
Wilcox and me for him being black.

1031
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,846
I mean, imagine that,
Hell, I didn't even know the man.

1032
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,557
Yeah and he said
he killed somebody too.

1033
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,602
And some pretty
insulting things about us.

1034
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,562
I mean, white officers.

1035
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,564
Did he say who? Mention a name?

1036
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:30,358
Look, the goddamn nigger
was disrespectful.

1037
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:33,737
No way a colored soldier
speak to a white officer like that.

1038
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,239
What are we doing,
wasting time on this?

1039
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:39,618
You answer him
like he wants you to, Byrd,

1040
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:42,704
or I'll stick it to your ass
every chance I get.

1041
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:43,997
You got that?

1042
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,373
Yes, sir.

1043
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,209
Captain, let me handle this.

1044
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,502
Then handle it.

1045
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:56,426
You said he was disrespectful.
Is that why you killed him?

1046
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:59,179
- I killed no one.
- Sit down.

1047
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,556
- You hit him?
- Knocked him down.

1048
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:03,016
- Shot him.
- He was alive.

1049
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:04,684
You beat him up, shot him.

1050
01:16:04,852 --> 01:16:07,771
Get out of my face before I kill you.
Like Waters?

1051
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,147
- No!
- Soldier.

1052
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:11,608
He's trying to put it on me.
Sit down.

1053
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,569
Answer his questions, lieutenant.

1054
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,825
You were both coming off bivouac?
Speak up.

1055
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:22,994
You had weapons.
But we didn't fire.

1056
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,247
When did you turn them in?
Right away.

1057
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,082
Nivens took our .45s
to the MPs.

1058
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,291
He wanted it quiet.

1059
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,586
Didn't want colored boys to know
anybody white was involved.

1060
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,672
But those weapons
cleared ballistics.

1061
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:37,425
Besides, we've been short on .45
caliber ammo for, what, six months?

1062
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,804
It's for MPs
and special-duty people only.

1063
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:44,266
Look, nobody on that exercise
was issued any.

1064
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:46,977
What?

1065
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:53,817
I said, sir, nobody on the bivouac
was issued any .45 ammo.

1066
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:56,278
I don't believe you.

1067
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:57,821
Why wasn't I told?

1068
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:01,324
The weapons had cleared,
the colonel felt if he involved you,

1069
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:04,035
you'd go to Washington,
which you did anyway.

1070
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:07,998
Sir, I just wanna say we were not
involved with the sergeant's death.

1071
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:09,249
Now, I'm a doctor.

1072
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,127
We left that man on
the side of the road. Alive.

1073
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,546
- You're under arrest.
- The charge is murder.

1074
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:15,755
Captain...

1075
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,383
You think I believe that crap?

1076
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:22,012
Let them go.

1077
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:23,680
What?

1078
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:27,017
- Are we being charged?
- Not by me.

1079
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:33,690
What are you doing? You've got a
motive, you've got a witness.

1080
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,109
I mean, what more do you want?

1081
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,820
This is still my investigation,
Charlie.

1082
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:43,700
We've both been had, captain.
Colonel knew this all along.

1083
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:47,620
Been marching around in circles.
They are guilty and you know it.

1084
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,831
Now, I'll back you up.
Charge them.

1085
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:54,627
I do what the facts tell me, not you.
You don't know what a fact is.

1086
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,505
I'm the lawyer.
They teach law at West Point?

1087
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:01,551
You don't have to be a lawyer to
deal with those two assholes.

1088
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:05,138
And if they didn't
kill Waters, who did?

1089
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:08,224
I don't know yet.

1090
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:25,075
What do you know
about C.J. Memphis?

1091
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,413
A great ballplayer.

1092
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,374
Committed suicide.

1093
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:36,586
It was a tragedy.

1094
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,090
I think Waters tricked the kid
into attacking him.

1095
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,802
No, I can't believe that,
Davenport.

1096
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,596
This man managed
the finest baseball team

1097
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:49,307
in the entire
United States Army.

1098
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:52,310
Besides, colored people
aren't that devious.

1099
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,896
Hell, we hadn't lost a game
for two years.

1100
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:56,147
And the finest...

1101
01:18:56,315 --> 01:19:01,069
I mean, the finest player that
Waters ever had was C.J. Memphis.

1102
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,154
If you'd have seen him,
you'd know what I mean.

1103
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,450
Captain. Captain Davenport.

1104
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:11,454
We found Wilkie, but we haven't
located Peterson and Smalls yet.

1105
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,665
- Where's Wilkie?
- Waiting for you, sir.

1106
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:14,916
- Good.
- Wait.

1107
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:17,710
Didn't you question
Wilkie and Peterson already?

1108
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,797
I asked you a question.
This is my investigation.

1109
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:23,466
Ellis, let's go.
Well, that's the problem.

1110
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:26,511
You arrogant son of a bitch.

1111
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,434
You nervous, Wilkie?

1112
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:36,020
No, I just couldn't figure out
why you called me back, sir.

1113
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,356
You said the sarge
busted you, right?

1114
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:42,193
Yeah, he got me busted, sir.
He reported me to the captain.

1115
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,154
- How'd you feel?
- Well, I...

1116
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,030
You and the sarge
were good friends.

1117
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:48,408
- Yeah...
- He was a nice guy.

1118
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,618
Didn't you tell me that?
Yeah, I...

1119
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:52,954
Would a nice guy
get a friend busted?

1120
01:19:53,164 --> 01:19:54,372
- Well...
- No, speak up.

1121
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,583
You lied when you said
he was a nice guy?

1122
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,418
No. What I said was he was...

1123
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,796
Was Waters a nice guy or not?
No. No, he wasn't a nice guy.

1124
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:04,507
You don't turn somebody in.
Give him extra duty.

1125
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:08,094
But three stripes, it took me
10 years to get them stripes, sir.

1126
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:10,138
That's right.

1127
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,725
That made you mad, didn't it?
Yes, mad. Things I did for him.

1128
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:16,603
That's right. You were
his boy, weren't you?

1129
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,439
You took care of the team.

1130
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,232
- You ran his errands.
- Well...

1131
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:24,277
You policed his quarters.
You listened to his stories.

1132
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:26,696
Put the gun under C.J.'s bunk.
Yes. No...

1133
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:28,781
Sit down!

1134
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:32,869
It was you Henson saw. You lied
about Waters, you're lying now.

1135
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,706
The only person out of barracks. Who
else could've found C.J.'s bunk?

1136
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,208
It was you, Wilkie. You.

1137
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,502
It was the sarge.
He ordered me to do it.

1138
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:44,172
He said I'd get my stripes back.
He wanted to teach C.J. a lesson.

1139
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,798
Put him in jail, scare him.

1140
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,635
The boy hit him, he had C.J.
where he wanted him.

1141
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,137
And then C.J., he hung himself.

1142
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:53,640
He died
like he was spiting the sarge.

1143
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:57,143
He didn't figure on that.
What did he have against Memphis?

1144
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,730
He despised him, but he would hide
it, everybody liked that boy.

1145
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,107
Underneath, it was
a crazy hate, captain.

1146
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:06,277
Crazy hate. You won't believe it.
Sometimes you could...

1147
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:09,113

We were in France
in the first war,

1168
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,199
we'd won decorations,

1169
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:40,913
but the white boys had told all
them French gals that we had tails.

1170
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:45,043
And they found
this ignorant colored soldier.

1171
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:47,629
Paid him to tie a tail to his ass

1172
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,548
and run around half-naked
making monkey sounds.

1173
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,471
They put him on a big round table
in the Café Napoléon.

1174
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:59,724
Put a reed in his hand,

1175

a crown on his head,

1176
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:07,482
blanket on his shoulders, and made him
eat bananas in front of them Frenchies.

1177
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:11,944
Oh, how the white boys
danced that night,

1178
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:15,948
passed out leaflets
with that boy's picture on it.

1179
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:22,330
Called him Moonshine,
king of the monkeys.

1180
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,501
When we slit his throat,

1181
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:29,879
you know that fool asked us
what he had done wrong?

1182
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:53,986
My daddy told me, we got to turn
our backs on his kind, Wilkie.

1183
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,824
Close our ranks to
the chitlins, collard greens,

1184
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,368
corn-bread style.

1185
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:07,375
We are men, soldiers.
And I don't intend for our race

1186
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:11,713
to be cheated out of its place
of honor and respect in this war

1187
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:14,757
because of fools like C.J.

1188
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,553
You watch everything he does.

1189
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,847
Everything.

1190
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,727
Give me a drink.

1191
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:29,605
And I watched him.

1192
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,482
But Waters couldn't wait.

1193
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:37,572
He wouldn't talk about nothing else.
C.J. this, C.J. all the time.

1194
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:44,036
Why didn't he pick on Peterson?
They had the fight.

1195
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:45,747
He liked Peterson.

1196
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:48,541
Pete fought back.
Sarge admired that.

1197
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:51,711
He was planning to promote Pete.
You imagine that?

1198
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,381
He thought Peterson
would make a fine soldier.

1199
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:02,388
What did Peterson do
when C.J. died?

1200
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:04,599
Everybody blamed sarge.

1201
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:09,687
Pete put together that protest
that lost our last game.

1202
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:13,941
Afterwards, he kept to himself
or with Smalls.

1203
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:22,575
I didn't mean to do what I did.

1204
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,202
- Ellis!
- It wasn't my fault.

1205
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:25,578
- Ellis!
- Yes, sir.

1206
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:28,039
I did what he told me.
What is going on?

1207
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:29,290
We're shipping out.

1208
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,084
They're gonna give us Negroes
a chance to fight.

1209
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:36,088
Hitler ain't got a chance. After what
Joe Louis did to Max Schmeling...

1210
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:41,594
Twenty-four-hour standby alert.

1211
01:25:41,804 --> 01:25:44,263
It's the invasion of Europe, boys.

1212
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:47,642
Look out, Hitler, the niggers
is coming to get your ass

1213
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:48,851
through the fog.

1214
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:51,562
We gonna goose
the goose step there.

1215
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:52,814
Heil Hitler!

1216
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:55,691
We gonna turn them Nazis around.
Yeah!

1217
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:59,278
We're gonna teach them a thing
or two about them schwarze.

1218
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,714
- Ellis.
- Yes, sir.

1219
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,926
Private Wilkie is under arrest.
Take him to the stockade.

1220
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,302
Sir?

1221
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,763
You heard me.

1222
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:41,273
Private Smalls,
as you requested, sir.

1223
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:44,318
- Leave us alone, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

1224
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,035
Why'd you go AWOL, soldier?

1225
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:56,080
Private Anthony Smalls, sir.

1226
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,125
Answer my question.

1227
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,544
I didn't go A-W-O-L, sir.

1228
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:05,006
See, I got drunk in Tynin
and I was just...

1229
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:08,175
Weren't you and Peterson
supposed to be on detail?

1230
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,553
Where was Peterson?

1231
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:12,304
Speak up.

1232
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:16,058
I don't know, sir.
You just walked off your detail

1233
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:18,269
and Peterson did nothing?
No, sir.

1234
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:22,732
See, he warned me, sir. Said, "Listen, Smalls.
Listen up, you..."

1235
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:27,737
Are you trying to make a fool
out of me, Smalls?

1236
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:30,072
No, sir.

1237
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:34,076
You two went over the hill
together, didn't you?

1238
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:37,329
Answer me!

1239
01:29:41,168 --> 01:29:44,045
Yes.
Yes. You went over the hill

1240
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,715
because Peterson knew I'd find out
the two of you killed Waters.

1241
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:49,008
Didn't you?

1242
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:54,180
What? I can't hear you.

1243
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:57,391
You killed Waters, didn't you?

1244
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:01,103
I want an answer.

1245
01:30:01,772 --> 01:30:04,523
Did you kill Waters?

1246
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:07,443
It was Peterson, sir.

1247
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,655
It wasn't me.

1248
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:22,083
Smalls, look who's
drunk on his ass, boy.

1249
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:25,294
Oh, leave him be, Pete.

1250
01:30:25,504 --> 01:30:28,422
No, no.

1251
01:30:28,632 --> 01:30:30,925
No, I'm gonna enjoy this.

1252
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:35,554
Big, bad Sergeant Waters
down on his knee.

1253
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,141
No, sir, Smalls.

1254
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,269
No, I'm gonna love this.

1255
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:49,819
Hey, sarge.

1256
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:51,612
Need some help?

1257
01:30:51,822 --> 01:30:54,782
Hi, Pete.

1258
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:58,702
Oh, yeah. Here, come on
now, here we go.

1259
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:05,084
- That's the help I'll give you. Shut up!
- Peter...

1260
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,339
Smalls, some people...

1261
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:14,510
If this was a German,
would you kill it?

1262
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:23,352
If it was Hitler or that fucking
Tojo, would you kill him?

1263
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:25,813
There's a trick to it, Peterson.

1264
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:29,150
It's the only way you can win.

1265
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:31,610
See, C.J.,

1266
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,696
he could never make it.

1267
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:36,073
He was a clown.

1268
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:39,201
A clown in blackface. A nigger.

1269
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:43,372
See, you got to be like them.

1270
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:46,625
But the rules are fixed and...

1271
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:49,962
Listen.

1272
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:53,090
Hear it?

1273
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,677
It's C.J.

1274
01:31:57,387 --> 01:32:01,307
♪ Lowdown
Lowdown dirty shame ♪ ♪

1275
01:32:02,726 --> 01:32:04,727
I made him do it.

1276
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:11,609
But it doesn't make
any difference.

1277
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:22,077
They still hate you.

1278
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:32,087
Peterson. It's justice, Smalls.

1279
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:34,924
It's for C.J.

1280
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:40,638
Everybody. They still hate you.

1281
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:01,367
And you call that justice?

1282
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:06,956
No, sir.

1283
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:10,209
Then why the fuck
didn't you do something?

1284
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:12,294
I was just...

1285
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:15,881
Just scared of him, sir.

1286
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:19,468
He said everybody would think

1287
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:22,471
white people did it.

1288
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:26,392
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1289
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:31,981
I'm sorry, I was just
so scared about it.

1290
01:33:34,067 --> 01:33:36,735
Caught this one
on old bridge road, sir.

1291
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:41,240
That'll be all, thank you.

1292
01:33:58,425 --> 01:34:00,634
You told it, didn't you?

1293
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:23,866
I didn't kill much.

1294
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:28,245
Some things
need getting rid of.

1295
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:32,541
A man like Waters never did
nobody no good anyway, captain.

1296
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:45,179
Who gave you the right
to judge?

1297
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:50,851
To decide who is fit
to be a Negro

1298
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:55,230
and who is not? Who?

1299
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:05,741
Sergeant.

1300
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:13,874
Sir?

1301
01:35:14,084 --> 01:35:16,919
Get these goddamn men
out of here.

1302
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:18,629
Yes, sir.

1303
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:47,843
I hear they caught Peterson.

1304
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:52,639
I guess that's it.

1305
01:36:53,183 --> 01:36:54,224
Got your man.

1306
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:57,644
Yeah, I got him.

1307
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,566
I was wrong.

1308
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,571
So was I.

1309
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:10,699
Say, Charlie, look,
I could do with a lift.

1310
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:12,701
Hop in.

1311
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:29,968
I guess I'll have to get used to
Negroes with bars on their shoulders.

1312
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:31,970
You know, being in charge.

1313
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,598
Oh, you'll get used to it, captain.

1314
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,975
You can bet your ass on that.

1315
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:39,436
You'll get used to it.

1316
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:44,066
Hut!
