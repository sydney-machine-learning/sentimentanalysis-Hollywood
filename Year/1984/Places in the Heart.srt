1
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:39,830
Possum, put that up, now.

2
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,262
Our Heavenly Father...

3
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:58,224
bless this meal and those
who are about to receive it.

4
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,728
Make us thankful for your generous
bounty and your unceasing love.

5
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:06,482
Please remind us, in these hard times...

6
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,776
to be grateful for what
we have been given...

7
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,737
and not to ask for what we cannot have.

8
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,074
And make us mindful of those
less fortunate among us...

9
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:18,869
as we sit at this table
with all of thy bounty.

10
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,789
- Amen.
- Amen.

11
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:25,251
Turn your plate over.

12
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:27,711
Put your napkin in your lap.

13
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,007
Frank, you want to take some...

14
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:34,927
- okra and pass it to your pa?
- Yes, ma'am.

15
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:39,265
Forgot to tell you, we got a letter
from your Aunt Gladys.

16
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:43,227
She was hoping we could come
to Oklahoma and visit them...

17
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:45,271
during your vacation.

18
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:50,151
But, I don't know.
I was hoping we could paint the house.

19
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:55,114
I'll get it.

20
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:58,534
Thank you.

21
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:01,537
- Frank, one biscuit.
- Yes, ma'am.

22
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:05,249
Right on my biscuit.

23
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:07,710
Excuse me, Mrs. Spalding.
The sheriff home?

24
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:11,172
He is, but we just sat down to dinner.
Can't this wait?

25
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,923
No, ma'am. It seems like
we got a problem down...

26
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:15,468
It's all right!
I'll be right there, Jack!

27
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:19,472
Sorry to bother you, sheriff,
but there's a drunk Negro by the track.

28
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:21,974
- I thought you ought to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:37,031
- Where are you going?
- With Pa.

30
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,115
Royce?

31
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:42,745
No one excused you from the table,
young man. You stay here.

32
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:45,456
I won't be gone long.

33
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:52,505
- Who'd you say it was?
- That Wylie boy, sheriff...

34
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:14,777
Hey, boys, get on back now,
you hear me? You hear?

35
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:17,947
Wylie!

36
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,662
Wylie!

37
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,375
Howdy, Mr. Royce.

38
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,876
Nice day.

39
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:36,340
Wylie, you're drunk as a skunk.

40
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:39,051
I sure am, Mr. Royce.

41
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,553
You know better than that.

42
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:43,264
I'm sorry, Mr. Royce.

43
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:46,934
- You ready to come with me now?
- Just a minute.

44
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:01,198
Wylie, are you done?

45
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:22,928
Royce...

46
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,039
Frank!

47
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:52,208
Frank!

48
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,960
Frank, give me my doll!

49
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:04,887
Frank. Possum.

50
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:08,682
- Give me my doll!
- Frank. Possum.

51
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:10,434
Come here.

52
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,645
Come on.

53
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:27,368
Something's happened to your pa.

54
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:51,517
- What do you think?
- Get her out here.

55
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:53,894
Ma?

56
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:55,771
Ma?

57
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:58,149
Never you mind, hon. Don't you look.

58
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:09,410
Come on.

59
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:13,789
For pity's sake,
what do you think you're doing?

60
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:21,714
You get out of here. Right now.

61
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:25,509
- Right now, Glen. I mean it.
- Guess we can go now.

62
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,518
Oh, sis.

63
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:37,897
Rosalie, you go down.

64
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:39,982
Go inside, both of you.

65
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,276
Oh, sis.

66
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:44,904
Sis, I'm so sorry.

67
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:47,490
I am so sorry.

68
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:51,410
I don't want anybody to see me.

69
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:55,456
- I don't want anybody to see me.
- I'm not gonna let anybody see you.

70
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:58,542
Nobody's gonna see you.

71
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,225
We would have been married
15 years this October.

72
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:18,229
We had two children.

73
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:24,902
And I never knew till just now
Royce had a scar right there.

74
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:31,951
I never knew that.

75
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:52,990
I was afrai...

76
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:55,576
I was afraid you wasn't gonna make it.

77
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,911
Just don't worry about anything.

78
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,332
Darling, I'm sorry.

79
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,585
I just heard.
I got here as fast as I could.

80
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,920
You all right? Come here.
It's all right.

81
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,714
It's all right.

82
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:41,932
Oh, honey,
everything's gonna be all right.

83
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:43,934
I'm here now.

84
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:46,312
I know how bad you feel.

85
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,441
There now, there now. I'm sorry.

86
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,818
All I could think of...

87
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:57,990
when I saw that poor man in there...

88
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:03,704
was what would I do if it was you?

89
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,292
What would I do if something
was to happen to you?

90
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,711
Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

91
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:14,048
I'm too ornery.

92
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:18,010
I don't think I could live without you.

93
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:22,181
Oh, I love you.

94
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,059
I love you so much.

95
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:29,021
I love you too.

96
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:45,955
Sorry to hear about it.

97
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:47,832
Thank you. We appreciate it.

98
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:52,711
- Wayne.
- Viola.

99
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,215
- Where's Edna?
- She's in the kitchen with Margaret.

100
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,260
All right.

101
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:01,262
Hi, Buddy.

102
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,848
Hello, Wayne. How you doing?

103
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,392
- How's Mrs. Spalding?
- She's all right.

104
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:10,896
Excuse me.

105
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:18,279
Vi...

106
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:21,615
You want to take this for a minute?
I'll be right back.

107
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,386
Here, sug.

108
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:47,808
Come on, you gotta eat something.

109
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,771
Marie Thornton made that.

110
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:55,107
It's real good.

111
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:04,283
Margaret.

112
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:10,831
What's gonna happen to us?

113
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:17,755
I can't support this family.

114
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:23,677
I haven't the least idea
how to go about it.

115
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:29,850
It seems...

116
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:36,065
like I have never done
anything all my life...

117
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:38,192
but raise kids...

118
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:41,070
and take care of this house.

119
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,241
Royce paid all the bills.

120
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:51,747
I never even knew how much
salary he made.

121
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:00,673
What's gonna happen to us?

122
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:32,538
And thou shalt eat
the herbs of the field.

123
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:37,334
In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread...

124
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,962
till thou return unto the ground...

125
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,757
for out of it wast thou taken.

126
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:44,884
For dust thou art...

127
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,887
and unto dust thou shall return.

128
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,513
Amen.

129
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:46,946
Lord, I thought those people
would never leave.

130
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:51,117
- Margaret, let me get this now.
- No, you go on and rest.

131
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,701
I'll get that.

132
00:17:58,707 --> 00:17:59,667
Evening, ma'am.

133
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:03,462
Excuse me, but I was wondering
if you have any work around here?

134
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:07,299
No. There's nothing here.

135
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:10,136
You go on now. Shoo.

136
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:11,929
What is it?

137
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:15,266
I was just asking if you had any
chores I can help with.

138
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:17,726
Oh, no, there's no work around here.

139
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:20,146
I can make you a plate of food.

140
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,481
Thank you, ma'am.

141
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:24,567
You wait out by the gate.

142
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:25,693
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,782
Excuse me!

144
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:14,825
Morning!

145
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:19,371
I thought I told you last night
you can't stay around here.

146
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:22,708
Well, I seen you was almost
out of firewood...

147
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,960
so I thought I'd chop some for you.

148
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,590
I could fix you some breakfast,
but after that, you got to go.

149
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:31,383
Thank you, ma'am.

150
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:44,605
You know, ma'am...

151
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:48,651
you got a nice henhouse over here.

152
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,904
Of course, it's about ready
to fall down.

153
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:56,200
A mighty good-looking milk cow.

154
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:59,286
She sure need taking care of, though.

155
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:06,210
There must be close
to 40 acres out back.

156
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:09,380
I reckon with the right kind of help...

157
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:12,800
you'd make yourself a handsome
living just farming cotton.

158
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,261
All you need is somebody like me...

159
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:19,140
who knows most everything there is
to know about farming cotton.

160
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:22,101
I was thinking that maybe...

161
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:25,604
I could work around here for food
and a place to stay.

162
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:28,274
No. I can't give you any work.

163
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:31,444
I could fix you some breakfast,
and then you've got to leave.

164
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:39,827
- No such thing as a job, nowadays.
- I'm sorry.

165
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:41,579
I'll fix you a nice plate of food.

166
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:44,498
You go wait out there
and I'll bring it to you, okay?

167
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,125
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:57,928
I can mend this fence with no
trouble at all, right after breakfast.

169
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,973
Oh, that'd be fine, just fine.

170
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:03,851
Okay. I'll be right out here.

171
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:32,421
Good afternoon, Mrs. Spalding.

172
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,881
Mr. Denby.

173
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,466
I hope I'm not bothering you.

174
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:38,803
- No. Won't you come in?
- Oh, thank you.

175
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:45,684
- Please.
- Thank you.

176
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:52,817
Mrs. Spalding, on behalf of everyone
down at the First Farmers Bank...

177
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:57,113
if there's anything we can do
in this hour of need, please ask.

178
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:58,531
Thank you.

179
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:01,492
Mrs. Spalding...

180
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,663
I don't know how much your husband
told you about his business.

181
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,417
But at the close
of banking hours yesterday...

182
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:14,046
you had a balance of $116.72.

183
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,924
However, when your husband
bought this place...

184
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:19,593
he did borrow money from the bank.

185
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:23,139
At the time of his death
he still owed...

186
00:22:23,347 --> 00:22:28,227
$3681, to be paid twice a year.

187
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:31,605
What that means, Mrs. Spalding, is...

188
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:37,069
come October 15th,
you will owe the bank $240.

189
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:41,615
We were wondering if you had any idea
how you were gonna make that payment.

190
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:45,077
Yes.

191
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,913
Matter of fact, I do.

192
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:50,541
I was thinking...

193
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,919
Rilla Langsford and her sister
have that nice little gift shop...

194
00:22:54,128 --> 00:22:55,921
and, well, I thought I could
do the same thing.

195
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:59,425
I could get some pretty little things,
and I could set them out...

196
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:02,970
Mrs. Spalding, why would someone
come all the way out here...

197
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,890
when the Langsfords' place
is there on the square?

198
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:08,309
Oh.

199
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:12,563
Mrs. Spalding, what we at the bank
suggest is that you sell this place.

200
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:14,774
Now I know times are hard...

201
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,904
but maybe we can pay off the loan
and have something to tide you over.

202
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:22,448
But where would we live?

203
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:25,493
I believe you have a sister
that resides here.

204
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:29,246
No, Margaret couldn't take us in.

205
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:32,249
She couldn't afford it, and besides,
she hasn't got room.

206
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,461
Mrs. Spalding, when tragedies
like this happen...

207
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:40,091
sometimes we have to face up
to things that are real hard.

208
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:46,138
Sometimes it's necessary to split
families up, temporarily.

209
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:49,517
I believe your husband
has some family up in Oklahoma.

210
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:52,311
I'm sure they could take one
of your children.

211
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,188
I can't talk about this right now.

212
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:57,650
If you'll excuse me,
you can let yourself out.

213
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:03,739
I think that just about does the trick.

214
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:05,282
That'll be...

215
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:08,202
75 cents.

216
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,541
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

217
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:15,793
Right. Thank you, Ruby.

218
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:18,462
I didn't know you were busy.

219
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:21,132
That's all right. I was just leaving.

220
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,466
- Bye, Ruby.
- Bye-bye.

221
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,301
- Kids, come on in.
- Hi, Aunt Margaret.

222
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,928
Don't touch anything, Possum.

223
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,722
Watch your sister.
Don't let her touch anything.

224
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:33,102
Mrs. Parks offered to buy
five pounds of tomatoes from us.

225
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,688
So we thought we'd come by
and say hello.

226
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:37,231
Where's Rosalie?

227
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,984
I'm sorry.
She's gone off with her daddy.

228
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:44,113
But if you go in the kitchen,
I got some Coca-Cola in the icebox.

229
00:24:44,321 --> 00:24:46,574
- Can we, Mommy?
- Yeah, you can.

230
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:51,162
- Frank, split one with your sister.
- Okay, Mom!

231
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,330
It's all right. You can each have one.

232
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,084
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Aunt Margaret.

233
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:19,523
Margaret, I've been thinking.

234
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:23,402
Maybe I could work for you.

235
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:26,906
I don't know much about this work,
but I could learn.

236
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:29,033
I'm a real good worker.

237
00:25:30,493 --> 00:25:31,869
Oh, hon.

238
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:38,542
I hardly got enough customers
these days to support me and Wayne.

239
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:42,546
I understand, Margaret.
Don't you even think about it.

240
00:25:42,755 --> 00:25:44,965
Kids, come on. We got to go.
It's getting dark.

241
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:47,384
- Here, I got $28 saved.
- I don't want that.

242
00:25:47,593 --> 00:25:50,554
Take it. Wayne will just spend it
on some fool thing.

243
00:25:50,763 --> 00:25:52,473
I don't need it.

244
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:54,225
Come on, kids!

245
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:57,269
- Bye, Aunt Margaret.
- Goodbye, Aunt Margaret.

246
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,981
I swear you are just like Daddy.

247
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:05,403
You'd think he was sawing off
his leg to ask for the least thing.

248
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,572
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

249
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,932
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

250
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:39,353
We caught this nigger with a bunch
of things I think might belong to you.

251
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:41,856
Found him down by the tracks.

252
00:26:42,064 --> 00:26:43,691
He claimed he was working for you...

253
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,943
but it looks like he was leaving town.

254
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,156
No, he's working for me.

255
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:54,243
I needed somebody to help out around
here, and so I took on...

256
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:56,328
Moses. Moses Hadnot.

257
00:26:56,537 --> 00:27:00,624
I took on Moses to do some chores
until I could get straightened away.

258
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,418
Mrs. Spalding, are you sure?

259
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:04,795
I mean, I found all that silver on him.

260
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:09,300
Oh, it's Mama's, and Margaret
wanted to borrow it.

261
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:13,512
If you had gone straight there and back,
you wouldn't have this trouble.

262
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:14,722
Yes'm.

263
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,975
Mrs. Spalding,
are you sure you're all right?

264
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:20,519
Well...

265
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:22,772
good night.

266
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,356
Good night, Jack.

267
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,877
Ma'am, I appreciate what you've done...

268
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:47,379
How much could I make
if I was to plant cotton?

269
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:48,672
Cotton?

270
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:51,884
Well, last year cotton fetched
six cents a pound.

271
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:55,054
You got, say, 30 acres here,
you figure...

272
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,973
That's 300 and some dollars.
If you take out...

273
00:27:58,182 --> 00:27:59,850
You sure you can do it?

274
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,104
Ma'am, I been chopping cotton
since I was 5 years old.

275
00:28:03,312 --> 00:28:05,439
I know all there is to know
about cotton.

276
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:09,610
All right, you stay in the shed
beside the barn.

277
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:12,488
Ma'am, I wanted to say
that I appreciate...

278
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:16,033
If you ever steal from me again,
I'll shoot you myself.

279
00:28:16,242 --> 00:28:17,576
You understand that?

280
00:28:32,716 --> 00:28:34,301
Thank you. See you next week.

281
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,845
Good to see you.

282
00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:40,599
- Good morning, Mrs. Spalding.
- Thanks.

283
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:44,270
Hello, Mrs. Spalding.
It's nice to see you again so soon.

284
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:46,814
Won't you come right in here?

285
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:52,737
Why don't you take a seat
right over there?

286
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,290
Mr. Denby...

287
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:07,084
I was wondering if you would...

288
00:29:07,293 --> 00:29:09,420
show me how to fill out a check?

289
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:13,007
I never did it before,
and I'd best learn how.

290
00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:17,636
Certainly, Mrs. Spalding.
It's just the simplest thing in the world.

291
00:29:17,845 --> 00:29:21,307
Now up here, this is where
you put the date.

292
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:23,309
Mr. Denby...

293
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:27,480
I'm thinking it won't be necessary
for me to sell my farm after all.

294
00:29:27,688 --> 00:29:31,776
Of course it's necessary.
I explained all that to you yesterday.

295
00:29:31,984 --> 00:29:34,195
- Down here...
- I was thinking...

296
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:36,155
if I was to plant cotton...

297
00:29:36,363 --> 00:29:39,366
Mrs. Spalding, you don't know a thing
about cotton farming.

298
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:42,995
- Yes, I know, but Moses says...
- Moses? Who's Moses?

299
00:29:43,162 --> 00:29:44,163
He's this Negro man.

300
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:47,208
I don't know any Negro
around here named Moses.

301
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:50,961
He was just passing through,
and I gave him a job doing some chores.

302
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:56,133
You're telling me you let some Negro
hobo talk you into planting cotton?

303
00:29:56,342 --> 00:29:58,803
Did you ever hear of the Depression?

304
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:00,805
Now...

305
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:03,641
you see these?

306
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:07,394
These are all foreclosures.
And that's just in the last three months.

307
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:12,149
White men who've cotton-farmed
all their lives and can't make a go of it.

308
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,985
And you listening to some
no-account nigger.

309
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:17,363
You'll excuse me, Mrs. Spalding...

310
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:20,658
but that's just about the most
ignorant thing I've ever heard.

311
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:23,160
Mr. Denby...

312
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:25,204
I'm not ignorant...

313
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:27,957
and I'm not selling my land.

314
00:30:28,165 --> 00:30:32,628
And I'm not giving my children over
to anyone else to raise.

315
00:30:32,837 --> 00:30:37,633
I'm going out and I'm buying
$15 worth of cottonseed.

316
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:41,846
So I'd appreciate it if you would
show me again how to write a check.

317
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,978
Okay, Mrs. Spalding, that's...

318
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:55,025
Let's see, 450 pound of cottonseed
at .03 cent a pound.

319
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:56,569
That comes to...

320
00:30:58,154 --> 00:30:59,989
$13.50.

321
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:02,366
- $13.50?
- Yes, ma'am.

322
00:31:02,575 --> 00:31:04,201
Load up Mrs. Spalding's wagon.

323
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,203
- Miz Spalding?
- Yes.

324
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,706
That ain't the seed you're paying for.

325
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:13,377
He's charging you for grade-A seed,
but that's gin-run quality.

326
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,338
Something wrong, ma'am?

327
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:21,594
Mr. Simmons, I think maybe
you gave us the wrong seed?

328
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:27,683
Well, so I did.

329
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:31,479
That's just an honest mistake,
isn't it, boy?

330
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:33,939
Isn't it, boy?

331
00:31:35,232 --> 00:31:36,442
Yes, sir.

332
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:41,238
Now you idiots gave Mrs. Spalding
the wrong seed.

333
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:43,491
We're lucky her nigger caught it.

334
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:47,453
That's a smart nigger you got there.
He's a credit to his race.

335
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:57,171
Why did you have to go shoot off your
big mouth in front of that white man?

336
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:01,175
I swear, you ain't never
gonna learn nothing.

337
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:05,679
You just got yourself into
a carload of trouble.

338
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,766
This ain't your land.
You just passing through.

339
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:10,726
That white woman ain't nothing to you.

340
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:15,106
These people ain't no reason to get
yourself killed.

341
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:18,526
Howdy.

342
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:21,946
Howdy.

343
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:24,156
What's your name?

344
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,117
Moses.

345
00:32:28,953 --> 00:32:30,830
My name's Frank.

346
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:36,877
- My pa was killed.
- I heard about it. I'm sure sorry.

347
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:40,339
He was shot.

348
00:32:41,715 --> 00:32:43,843
It was a nigger killed him.

349
00:32:58,107 --> 00:32:59,734
How old are you, child?

350
00:33:00,776 --> 00:33:03,738
Nine, and 4 months.

351
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:08,075
You mean to tell me you got to be
9 years and 4 months old...

352
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:10,411
and nobody told you it's bad luck...

353
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:12,830
to rock a rocking chair
with nobody in it?

354
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:16,500
Don't do no good now.
The damage is done.

355
00:33:17,418 --> 00:33:20,129
I knew a man who rocked
a empty rocking chair.

356
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:23,507
Before nightfall, he got run
over by a cotton wagon.

357
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:28,387
Here, take this rabbit foot.

358
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:32,600
And you do what I do and say
what I say, you understand?

359
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:35,352
First thing is you turn around
three times.

360
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:37,271
One...

361
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,440
two...

362
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:40,775
three.

363
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:45,237
Next thing is you walk backwards.
Seven, six...

364
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:46,280
five...

365
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:47,323
four...

366
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:48,449
three...

367
00:33:48,657 --> 00:33:50,409
two, one.

368
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,119
Thank you, Lord Jesus! Amen!

369
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:54,538
Thank you, Lord Jesus! Amen!

370
00:33:55,122 --> 00:33:56,457
Give back my rabbit foot.

371
00:33:56,665 --> 00:34:00,669
Got too much to do around here to go
around saving your life all the time.

372
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:09,845
If you're just gonna stand around,
you might as well be of some use.

373
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:12,223
Fetch me some of them nails over there.

374
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,404
What are you thinking about?

375
00:34:28,114 --> 00:34:30,616
I grew up in a place just like this.

376
00:34:32,493 --> 00:34:34,286
Boy, I hated it.

377
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:38,457
I used to run away every chance I got.

378
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,920
I'd sneak out of the house...

379
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,965
go out behind the barn.

380
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:48,884
Then I'd...

381
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:54,098
head out across the pasture and down
to this grove of elm trees.

382
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,893
And right in the middle...

383
00:34:58,102 --> 00:35:02,356
was this little spot where I used to go
and sit all the time.

384
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,833
Hello!

385
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:23,919
Watch your step here.

386
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:27,465
And another one. And a little step up.

387
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:34,805
Mrs. Spalding?

388
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:38,100
Yes, Mr. Denby, I'm in the back yard!

389
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:40,019
I'll be right there.

390
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:47,359
Now put that thing away.

391
00:35:47,568 --> 00:35:50,446
This woman may not like people
smoking in her house.

392
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:54,909
Now, please, for once in your life,
try and make a good impression.

393
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,670
Good afternoon, Mrs. Spalding.
How are you?

394
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,005
I'm just fine.

395
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:11,634
I don't believe you know
my brother-in-law, Will.

396
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,303
How do you do?

397
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:17,515
Mind if we come in?

398
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:20,893
No. No, not at all.

399
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:28,609
Poor Will, here, lost his sight
in the big war.

400
00:36:28,818 --> 00:36:31,445
It was the Battle of the Somme,
wasn't it, Will?

401
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:37,159
He was a real war hero.
Weren't you, Will?

402
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:42,081
Will, he doesn't like to talk
about these things too much.

403
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:44,959
- Do you, Will?
- No.

404
00:36:46,627 --> 00:36:49,839
Will's been living with his mama
until she passed away...

405
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:53,592
and since that time he's been
visiting with my wife and me.

406
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:56,345
Now then, Mrs. Spalding...

407
00:36:56,554 --> 00:37:00,057
in spite of the fact
that I have great doubts about...

408
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:04,145
this misguided attempt of yours
to hold on to this place...

409
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:08,399
as a Christian and deacon of the church,
it's my beholden duty to...

410
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:11,694
reach out the hand of charity
to a human being in need.

411
00:37:11,902 --> 00:37:16,073
And I got to thinking, now what better
way to help out this poor woman...

412
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:18,451
than if she took in a boarder.

413
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:23,539
Someone who could move in here,
and by paying a modest rent, help her out.

414
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:28,836
What if my brother-in-law was to move
in here and rent a room from you?

415
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:29,879
Move in here?

416
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:34,383
Will makes a living caning chairs
and making brooms, so don't you worry.

417
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:41,223
Oh, Mr. Denby, I'm...

418
00:37:43,726 --> 00:37:47,229
I so appreciate your thoughtfulness.

419
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:52,401
This just isn't a good time.

420
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:56,739
Sit down, Will.

421
00:38:00,826 --> 00:38:01,827
Will?

422
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:09,627
Mrs. Spalding...

423
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:13,589
speaking on behalf of the bank...

424
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:18,177
we'd take it as a sign that you're
trying to provide for your family.

425
00:38:20,513 --> 00:38:23,265
When would you like
your brother-in-law to move in?

426
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,395
As a matter of fact, I have his things
out in the car right now.

427
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:43,786
Anything special you like to eat?

428
00:38:43,994 --> 00:38:46,497
I'm not a very good cook,
but I'm willing to try.

429
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:52,545
I don't want me to be here any more
than you do. I won't be any trouble.

430
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:56,715
And all I'll ask in return is to be
left alone in peace and quiet.

431
00:38:56,924 --> 00:38:58,676
- I thought...
- I know what you thought.

432
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:03,139
But I don't need your help,
and I don't need you to feel sorry for me.

433
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:32,334
Honey?

434
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,795
I'm in back, darling.

435
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:39,508
Where you been?
We're real late for the dance.

436
00:39:40,342 --> 00:39:44,054
Old man Wilson ought to put that
Studebaker of his out to pasture.

437
00:39:44,263 --> 00:39:48,100
Not a week goes by without something
going wrong with that fool thing.

438
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:51,729
And the trouble is, he thinks he can
fix it all by himself.

439
00:39:51,937 --> 00:39:54,064
So he goes in there
and messes everything up...

440
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:56,901
and makes it worse
than it was in the first place.

441
00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:01,697
I think he does it on purpose,
just so I'll come out and talk to him.

442
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,036
You know that carburetor
I fixed for him last week? He...

443
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:21,300
Where's Rosalie?

444
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:26,806
She's over at your mama's.
She's gonna sleep there tonight.

445
00:40:32,812 --> 00:40:36,232
You ought not to eat that.
You'll get fat.

446
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,441
What about you?

447
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,945
- A lot you'd notice.
- I'd notice.

448
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:46,325
Wayne, we gotta go. Everybody's waiting.

449
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:48,077
Wayne, you got to...

450
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,068
Hi!

451
00:41:30,953 --> 00:41:32,163
Howdy.

452
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:39,336
Let's go inside and dance.

453
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:42,423
Come on, let's go dance.

454
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:47,845
I'll get it. I'll get it.

455
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:50,473
Thank you, baby.

456
00:41:55,895 --> 00:41:57,813
- You warm enough?
- I'm fine.

457
00:41:58,022 --> 00:41:59,315
You sure?

458
00:42:00,107 --> 00:42:01,859
- Want my coat?
- No.

459
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:04,987
That's a nice table.

460
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:06,906
Hey, Wayne!

461
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:08,574
Howdy, Hank.

462
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:13,621
I sure am glad Rosalie
took that little trip tonight.

463
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:15,664
Why are you saying that?

464
00:42:15,873 --> 00:42:18,250
Where were you two?
We were getting worried.

465
00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:20,419
- Where you been?
- Hi, you guys!

466
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:22,797
- Hi, Buddy.
- Come here. I'll buy us a drink.

467
00:42:23,005 --> 00:42:25,382
We're getting a bottle
of good-for-what-ails-you.

468
00:42:25,591 --> 00:42:26,717
Be right back.

469
00:42:29,553 --> 00:42:30,846
Just be a minute.

470
00:42:31,764 --> 00:42:33,849
- How you been?
- I been just fine.

471
00:42:34,058 --> 00:42:35,726
Hey, I hear you...

472
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:39,647
Where were you two?

473
00:43:02,128 --> 00:43:04,463
Put that down. Come on.

474
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:02,688
Frank, are you craz...?

475
00:44:03,355 --> 00:44:06,817
That man catches us in here,
he's gonna skin us alive.

476
00:44:07,026 --> 00:44:10,362
I got something important to show you.
Do you want to see it or not?

477
00:44:31,842 --> 00:44:34,887
Recordings for the Blind presents:

478
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:38,390
Trent's Last Case, by E.C. Bentley.

479
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:41,102
Chapter one, "Bad News."

480
00:44:41,811 --> 00:44:45,106
Between what matters
and what seems to matter...

481
00:44:45,314 --> 00:44:48,943
how should the world
we know judge wisely?

482
00:44:49,151 --> 00:44:53,197
When the scheming, indomitable brain
of Sigfried Manderson was scattered...

483
00:44:53,406 --> 00:44:55,324
Frank!

484
00:44:56,617 --> 00:44:58,202
Possum!

485
00:45:00,788 --> 00:45:02,206
Coming, Mama!

486
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:14,718
Ten minutes later,
he's driving a new Buick.

487
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:16,554
- You through?
- Yeah.

488
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:18,305
Vi and me are gonna dance.

489
00:45:18,514 --> 00:45:20,057
I don't want to dance, Wayne.

490
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:23,269
Don't say no.
You have to dance. Come on.

491
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,357
Haven't danced all night. Excuse me.

492
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:31,569
You look pretty tonight.

493
00:45:38,617 --> 00:45:41,996
Let's go up to Dallas
this weekend, all right?

494
00:45:42,204 --> 00:45:44,081
Take in a picture show...

495
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,917
then have supper out
just like an old married couple?

496
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:50,504
You can tell Buddy you're visiting
that aunt of yours up in Dallas...

497
00:45:50,713 --> 00:45:53,799
- No.
- Why not? Nobody will know.

498
00:45:54,008 --> 00:45:58,387
- Wayne, I can't go on like this.
- Honey, just be patient.

499
00:45:58,596 --> 00:46:02,558
I'll work everything out, don't worry.
Just give me a little bit of time.

500
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:05,269
I'll think of something, all right?

501
00:46:05,978 --> 00:46:10,566
What's the matter, Vi?
We'll be fine. Just trust me.

502
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:13,277
Wayne, we're not gonna see
each other anymore.

503
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:14,779
- What?
- Not like we have been.

504
00:46:14,987 --> 00:46:17,490
- Why?
- This is goodbye.

505
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,808
Mrs. Spalding?

506
00:47:27,893 --> 00:47:29,478
Mrs. Spalding?

507
00:47:32,273 --> 00:47:33,816
Mrs. Spalding?

508
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:46,412
Yes, Mr. Will. I'm right here.

509
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:48,289
Mrs. Spalding, believe me...

510
00:47:48,998 --> 00:47:51,667
if I had anyplace else to go
tonight besides...

511
00:47:51,876 --> 00:47:55,171
the State Home for the Infirm,
I'd gladly leave right now.

512
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,758
When I came here,
all I asked was to be left alone.

513
00:47:58,924 --> 00:48:02,052
I am not some kind of freak
that is here on display...

514
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:05,556
for the amusement of those hooligans
you call children.

515
00:48:05,765 --> 00:48:06,807
- I will not...
- What?

516
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:09,393
...have them vandalizing
my personal property.

517
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:12,646
Don't come in my house
and talk about my children like that!

518
00:48:12,855 --> 00:48:16,567
They are not hooligans or vandals!
They're well brought up children!

519
00:48:16,776 --> 00:48:19,028
- You can't walk into my house...
- Fine!

520
00:48:31,332 --> 00:48:32,333
Fine.

521
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,921
Whatever they are, you just
keep them out of my room.

522
00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:41,967
That's all right, I'll get it.

523
00:48:47,473 --> 00:48:49,308
The door's on your right.

524
00:48:49,975 --> 00:48:51,227
Thank you.

525
00:49:04,573 --> 00:49:06,575
Good night, Mrs. Spalding.

526
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,245
Good night, Mr. Will.

527
00:49:46,323 --> 00:49:47,783
Ready, ma'am?

528
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:51,829
Get along, mules! Get along!

529
00:49:55,082 --> 00:49:56,917
Now get along, mules!

530
00:49:59,211 --> 00:50:03,340
Hah! Hah! Get along there! Hah!

531
00:50:06,385 --> 00:50:08,304
Keep them straight, ma'am.

532
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:12,183
That's fine. That's just fine.

533
00:50:56,185 --> 00:50:59,688
Right, Spalding. You don't know
the first thing about smoking.

534
00:50:59,897 --> 00:51:02,233
I do so. I been smoking
since I was little.

535
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:05,986
- Then how come you can't inhale?
- I can so. I can inhale real good.

536
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:07,988
Mr. Will! Mr. Will!

537
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:11,242
Frank got caught smoking in school
and the teacher told Ma...

538
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,327
and Frank's gonna catch it!

539
00:51:17,123 --> 00:51:19,667
Frank, I'll see you at school tomorrow.

540
00:51:32,513 --> 00:51:36,851
Well, young man?
What would your pa do if he were here?

541
00:51:37,643 --> 00:51:39,603
He'd spank me, I reckon.

542
00:51:41,689 --> 00:51:43,691
I guess that's what we got to do, then.

543
00:52:03,377 --> 00:52:06,255
Frank, what's she gonna do
to you? Frank!

544
00:52:06,505 --> 00:52:08,883
- Ma, what are you gonna do to him?
- It's okay.

545
00:52:09,091 --> 00:52:12,303
Ma, what you gonna do to Frank?
Are you gonna spank him?

546
00:52:12,511 --> 00:52:13,888
Can I watch? Can I?

547
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:15,306
Possum!

548
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,985
Frank, when your pa did this,
how'd he do it?

549
00:52:28,194 --> 00:52:29,320
Most times...

550
00:52:29,695 --> 00:52:33,365
I'd lean over the table, grab hold,
and he'd let me have it.

551
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:36,327
How many times?

552
00:52:36,911 --> 00:52:40,206
Pa would be mad
over something like this.

553
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,293
I reckon he'd give me 10 good licks.

554
00:52:55,054 --> 00:52:56,388
I'm ready.

555
00:53:10,236 --> 00:53:11,195
Ma?

556
00:53:11,779 --> 00:53:13,239
I'm ready.

557
00:53:35,594 --> 00:53:36,595
What's wrong?

558
00:53:36,804 --> 00:53:38,806
Frank's getting a licking.

559
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:47,898
Did it hurt?

560
00:53:55,948 --> 00:53:57,074
Come on.

561
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,369
Let's let old Frank
be by himself for a bit.

562
00:54:01,495 --> 00:54:04,790
Tell you what, why don't you
help me with my chores?

563
00:54:12,923 --> 00:54:14,550
Mrs. Spalding?

564
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,888
I won't do that again. Ever.

565
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,477
Are you all right?

566
00:54:29,315 --> 00:54:31,358
God, I miss my husband.

567
00:54:50,836 --> 00:54:54,048
Lord, I can't hardly see
my hand in front of my face.

568
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:56,008
Feels like rain.

569
00:54:56,342 --> 00:54:59,970
- Must be coming up a real storm.
- Sure is.

570
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:12,858
Help me wash dishes.

571
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:15,986
Now don't be mad, baby.
You're a good baby.

572
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:18,489
I made each of you some cookies too.

573
00:55:32,211 --> 00:55:33,546
Come on, boy. Let's git.

574
00:55:33,879 --> 00:55:35,339
Come on, git! Git!

575
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:41,220
Git on, git on! Come on! Come on!

576
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:44,974
We got to get inside, ma'am.
Storm's coming from over there!

577
00:55:45,182 --> 00:55:46,183
Git on! Git on, boy!

578
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:04,243
Come on! Let him be!

579
00:56:04,702 --> 00:56:05,870
Come on, boy!

580
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:08,539
Come on, won't you?

581
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:11,876
Let him go! Come on! Run!

582
00:56:19,383 --> 00:56:21,135
Girls, get in the schoolroom.

583
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:23,846
Boys! Robert, let's go!

584
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:26,849
Come on! Come on! No dawdling!

585
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,684
Sally!

586
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:32,438
Come on! Come along!
Be careful getting up these stairs.

587
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:36,108
Everybody get inside!

588
00:56:38,944 --> 00:56:40,696
- Where's Frank?
- I don't know.

589
00:56:41,113 --> 00:56:42,531
Let's go!

590
00:56:43,115 --> 00:56:44,450
Toby!

591
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:47,036
All right.

592
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:59,590
Get the windows open
before the house blows!

593
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:02,093
You get the dining room,
then get on the floor!

594
00:57:02,301 --> 00:57:04,428
I'll get these in here! Hurry up!

595
00:57:10,142 --> 00:57:11,936
You're a little baby.

596
00:57:17,024 --> 00:57:18,109
Possum!

597
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:46,470
Here! Give me him!

598
00:57:58,107 --> 00:57:59,442
Possum!

599
00:58:25,426 --> 00:58:28,804
- Possum, it's okay.
- Mr. Will! Mr. Will!

600
00:58:29,013 --> 00:58:30,181
It's okay.

601
00:58:41,692 --> 00:58:43,861
Step down! Step down!

602
00:58:44,445 --> 00:58:48,908
Step down! Step down! Step down!

603
00:58:55,581 --> 00:58:59,085
Frank Spalding!
There's a tornado coming!

604
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:02,588
Get on in here!
You'll get yourself killed.

605
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:05,758
I can't! I gotta get home!

606
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:25,403
Here!

607
00:59:27,071 --> 00:59:28,406
I got him, ma'am!

608
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:32,743
Come on, Mr. Will.

609
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:39,041
It's all right. It's all right.
Get in now.

610
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:45,673
Mr. Will! Step down! Step down!

611
00:59:48,509 --> 00:59:50,010
Watch your head!

612
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,266
Ma!

613
01:00:02,148 --> 01:00:04,483
- Ma!
- Oh, my God, it's Frank!

614
01:00:06,193 --> 01:00:08,487
Frank, stay there!

615
01:00:25,004 --> 01:00:26,464
Frank, come on!

616
01:00:26,672 --> 01:00:28,716
Now, come on, we got to get inside.

617
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:30,342
Come on, hurry up!

618
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,852
Get him in! Get him in!

619
01:01:24,563 --> 01:01:26,732
Okay! Come on! Get in there!

620
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:31,946
Hurry up! Get inside!

621
01:02:57,281 --> 01:02:58,449
Get off...!

622
01:03:01,452 --> 01:03:02,745
It's okay now.

623
01:03:03,037 --> 01:03:05,372
It's all over now. Come on out.

624
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,460
It's all right. It's all...

625
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:15,466
Vi?

626
01:03:19,553 --> 01:03:21,889
Hey, baby, it's okay.

627
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,936
It's okay now.
Everything's gonna be all right.

628
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,065
Oh, darling, I was so scared.

629
01:03:31,899 --> 01:03:33,818
I was so scared something would...

630
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:37,655
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happened to you.

631
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,108
Come on, ma'am.

632
01:04:21,449 --> 01:04:24,034
Here, give me your hand, Mr. Will.

633
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:25,953
How bad is it?

634
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,373
Everything's a little bent,
but it's still here.

635
01:04:59,945 --> 01:05:01,072
Come on.

636
01:05:02,448 --> 01:05:05,326
- Come on, Vi.
- Oh, Bud, let's leave this town.

637
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:08,788
There'll always be tornadoes.
Everybody'll always be poor.

638
01:05:08,996 --> 01:05:10,748
Nothing can work out here.

639
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:14,376
I want to move, Buddy. Please. I want...

640
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:15,795
Sure.

641
01:05:16,921 --> 01:05:18,297
Hold me.

642
01:05:45,699 --> 01:05:48,577
- Good morning, Mr. Will.
- Morning.

643
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,921
- Morning, Mr. Will.
- Good morning.

644
01:06:01,507 --> 01:06:03,926
- Good morning, Mr. Will.
- Morning.

645
01:06:08,013 --> 01:06:10,015
- In Chicago yesterday.

646
01:06:10,224 --> 01:06:12,601
Cotton held steady after dropping
to a record low...

647
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:15,813
of 3.5 cents a pound
over the last four days.

648
01:06:16,021 --> 01:06:18,357
Poultry and eggs were down
to a seasonal low.

649
01:06:18,524 --> 01:06:21,193
Corn remains unchanged.
Soybeans gained...

650
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,448
So let me see. At 3.5 cents a pound...

651
01:06:25,656 --> 01:06:27,783
30 acres, that would be...

652
01:06:27,992 --> 01:06:30,161
That comes to $175.

653
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,543
Think there's any chance
cotton prices'll go back up?

654
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,383
How much money you got
left in your account?

655
01:06:45,509 --> 01:06:47,970
Twenty-four dollars. That's all.

656
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:52,892
- It's not enough for your payment.
- I know.

657
01:06:56,187 --> 01:06:57,605
I was wondering...

658
01:06:58,439 --> 01:07:02,526
What I made from my cotton
would cover most of the payment.

659
01:07:03,944 --> 01:07:04,987
Could you all...

660
01:07:05,446 --> 01:07:07,490
maybe, wait for the rest?

661
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:11,243
That's something only the president
of the bank can decide.

662
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:14,371
- You shouldn't get your hopes up.
- Could you ask?

663
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,222
There ain't no chance
you'll ever get that prize money.

664
01:08:13,806 --> 01:08:16,475
- It won't work.
- It's a hundred dollars.

665
01:08:16,684 --> 01:08:19,019
And that plus a crop would be enough
to make the payment.

666
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,981
You cannot begin to get
that cotton picked on time.

667
01:08:22,189 --> 01:08:24,066
Why? Moses has said that it's ready.

668
01:08:24,275 --> 01:08:25,693
Moses always says things.

669
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,946
- It's not always true.
- I said cotton comes in early here.

670
01:08:29,155 --> 01:08:30,406
But in a couple days...

671
01:08:30,614 --> 01:08:32,992
the pickers will get up to this county.

672
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:35,786
They pick it fast
as you can say Jack Robinson!

673
01:08:35,995 --> 01:08:38,831
- Then we'll start right now!
- You got 30 acres to pick.

674
01:08:38,998 --> 01:08:40,207
The kids can help.

675
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,834
That won't be nearly enough.

676
01:08:42,001 --> 01:08:45,004
- I'll pick 24 hours a day.
- Did you ever pick cotton?

677
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:47,339
After an hour, the hulls
start cutting your fingers.

678
01:08:47,548 --> 01:08:49,216
By noon your hands is bleeding.

679
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,260
Later your fingers start to swell.

680
01:08:51,469 --> 01:08:53,971
Later there ain't no feeling
in your hands.

681
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,808
I ain't even speaking about
what it does to your knees and your back.

682
01:08:58,017 --> 01:09:01,604
Get that through your head.
Once and for all, we can't do it.

683
01:09:01,812 --> 01:09:04,064
Stop thinking about it
before you kill yourself!

684
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,275
Now you listen to me.

685
01:09:06,484 --> 01:09:09,320
If we lose this place,
you're going back to begging for meals.

686
01:09:09,528 --> 01:09:11,238
They'll put you in a state home.

687
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:13,365
I'll lose what's left of my family.

688
01:09:13,532 --> 01:09:14,784
I won't let that happen.

689
01:09:14,992 --> 01:09:17,411
I don't care what it takes.
I don't care if it kills me.

690
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,872
I don't care if it kills you.
I won't give up.

691
01:09:20,206 --> 01:09:23,626
And if the two of you do,
you can go straight to hell!

692
01:09:24,418 --> 01:09:25,920
Careful with that now, hon.

693
01:09:31,842 --> 01:09:33,135
I bet she isn't ready.

694
01:09:33,344 --> 01:09:36,263
All the time we been coming here,
she's never been ready.

695
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:39,683
I'm here. I'm coming.

696
01:09:40,017 --> 01:09:42,686
I start out an hour early,
I always end up a half-hour late.

697
01:09:42,895 --> 01:09:44,355
Okay, what can I do to help?

698
01:09:44,563 --> 01:09:46,899
Get the cards on top
of the chest of drawers.

699
01:09:47,066 --> 01:09:49,276
- That looks good.
- Want me to do something?

700
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:51,529
Set up the table, would you, Buddy?

701
01:10:07,044 --> 01:10:09,004
Let me help you with that, Margaret.

702
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,446
Can you find them?
Here, let me get the light.

703
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:36,574
Right here.

704
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:40,369
Come on.

705
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:07,855
You want my peanuts, honey?

706
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:14,236
I'll take your six, honey.
Discard and rummy.

707
01:11:15,029 --> 01:11:16,447
I don't believe you.

708
01:11:16,822 --> 01:11:18,199
Thirty-two here.

709
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,827
Thirty-two. What's the damage, Margaret?

710
01:11:22,703 --> 01:11:23,913
Seventy-three.

711
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:25,623
Seventy-three?

712
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:32,296
Listen, you two. Vi and me
got a little announcement.

713
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:36,926
Next time you want
to play cards with us...

714
01:11:37,134 --> 01:11:39,011
you'll have to go to Houston.

715
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:41,847
I got an offer from an oil company
down there...

716
01:11:42,348 --> 01:11:43,641
too good to pass up.

717
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:47,978
You've lived here all your lives.

718
01:11:48,395 --> 01:11:50,648
Well, don't look at me.
It was Vi's idea.

719
01:11:51,065 --> 01:11:54,527
You know how hard it is to change
her mind once she gets it set.

720
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:56,862
We'll miss you, Margaret.

721
01:11:58,197 --> 01:12:01,534
It's just such a wonderful
opportunity for Bud.

722
01:12:02,576 --> 01:12:04,495
We just can't pass it up.

723
01:12:08,374 --> 01:12:11,836
We'll miss you a lot more
than you'll miss us.

724
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:17,967
Congratulations.

725
01:12:18,884 --> 01:12:20,678
Congratulations, Buddy.

726
01:12:20,886 --> 01:12:22,221
We're real happy for you.

727
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:25,683
Thanks. I'll get another drink.
You want one?

728
01:12:39,905 --> 01:12:41,365
It's my deal.

729
01:13:13,773 --> 01:13:17,151
Whatever happened between you and Vi,
I don't want to know about it.

730
01:13:19,111 --> 01:13:21,155
I don't ever want to hear about it.

731
01:13:21,739 --> 01:13:23,074
Am I right?

732
01:13:25,117 --> 01:13:26,660
Am I right?

733
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,873
Yes.

734
01:13:33,584 --> 01:13:38,255
I'm not the same dumb beauty operator
you married eight years ago.

735
01:13:47,973 --> 01:13:49,308
What are you gonna do?

736
01:13:53,979 --> 01:13:55,439
I don't know.

737
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,193
I got the shop.

738
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:02,947
Rosalie and me can get along
without you.

739
01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:07,993
I'm never going to see Viola again.

740
01:14:08,953 --> 01:14:12,123
- It's over between us.
- It's too late for that.

741
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:16,836
I don't think I can live
with you anymore.

742
01:14:20,381 --> 01:14:22,716
I don't think I love you anymore.

743
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:28,472
Please don't say that.

744
01:16:24,755 --> 01:16:26,382
Lord, this ain't gonna work.

745
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:29,552
Ain't no way we gonna get
all this cotton picked...

746
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,887
and yet you sent us out here anyway.

747
01:16:32,096 --> 01:16:35,433
I swear, sometimes I don't know
what's gotten into you.

748
01:17:00,332 --> 01:17:02,126
Mr. Will, you gotta talk to that woman.

749
01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:04,587
She won't pay me no mind,
but she listens to you.

750
01:17:04,795 --> 01:17:06,464
It won't do any good.

751
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:10,009
We only picked 2 acres today.
Should've done at least 4.

752
01:17:10,551 --> 01:17:13,679
And that's when we're fresh.
What's it gonna be in a week?

753
01:17:13,888 --> 01:17:17,016
How many pickers would it take
to get the cotton in on time?

754
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,353
Nine or 10, at least.

755
01:17:22,855 --> 01:17:24,482
Okay. We better hire them.

756
01:17:25,775 --> 01:17:27,860
- Hire pickers?
- With what, Mrs. Spalding?

757
01:17:28,069 --> 01:17:30,488
You said yourself you only had
$24 in the bank.

758
01:17:30,696 --> 01:17:32,948
That ain't near enough
to hire 10 pickers.

759
01:17:33,157 --> 01:17:34,825
I'll pay them out of the first bale.

760
01:17:35,034 --> 01:17:36,660
And what happens
if you don't get the first bale in?

761
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:39,246
Then I'll pay them out of the money
I get from the gin.

762
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,874
If you do that,
you'll have hardly any money left.

763
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,460
I'll take that chance.

764
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:14,323
We ain't got much time
before them pickers in the South...

765
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:20,371
All right, ma'am.
You got what you asked for.

766
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:23,707
Have they had breakfast yet?

767
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:26,544
I doubt it.

768
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:48,274
Governor Johnson appealed
to President Roosevelt today...

769
01:18:48,482 --> 01:18:51,652
for emergency relief due to
the failure of the WPA program...

770
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,738
to get started in Dallas.

771
01:18:53,946 --> 01:18:56,073
The governor had asked
the administration...

772
01:18:56,282 --> 01:18:59,160
for $1,000,000
in direct relief yesterday.

773
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:02,621
Texas was allotted $500,000 instead.

774
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:06,292
Governor Johnson said the situation
was becoming critical.

775
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:08,294
Meanwhile, in Baton Rouge...

776
01:19:08,502 --> 01:19:12,506
Huey Long's last legislative
measures, 37 of them...

777
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:16,427
took a fall last Tuesday,
as the administration he left behind him...

778
01:19:16,635 --> 01:19:19,930
pushed its investigation
of his assassination 10 days ago...

779
01:19:20,139 --> 01:19:22,600
by Dr. Carl A. Weiss, Jr.

780
01:19:24,435 --> 01:19:28,939
The Chicago Cubs retained their lead
in the National League pennant race...

781
01:19:29,148 --> 01:19:31,484
by defeating the New York Giants 8-3...

782
01:19:31,692 --> 01:19:34,153
before a crowd of 29,740...

783
01:19:34,361 --> 01:19:36,363
at Wrigley Field in Chicago.

784
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:38,991
It was the Cubs' 13th straight victory.

785
01:19:39,158 --> 01:19:42,787
Second place St. Louis Cardinals
beat Brooklyn 1-0...

786
01:19:42,995 --> 01:19:46,332
The Giants are now 4 1/2 games
behind the Cubs.

787
01:19:50,336 --> 01:19:53,672
The weather in central Texas today
will be clear, no sign of rain.

788
01:20:19,865 --> 01:20:21,951
Over here, Mr. Will!

789
01:20:26,497 --> 01:20:29,542
- Moze, the pickers are here.
- How you know that?

790
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,086
I heard 11 trucks pass by the house...

791
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,380
and from the direction
they were headed...

792
01:20:34,588 --> 01:20:36,465
they were going out to the Rapp place.

793
01:20:36,674 --> 01:20:38,509
- How much land the Rapps have?
- Four hundred acres.

794
01:20:39,927 --> 01:20:41,762
That means we got three days left.

795
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:45,182
We ain't got no time to waste!
Let's get to work!

796
01:21:57,963 --> 01:21:59,298
Git along there!

797
01:21:59,924 --> 01:22:01,258
Git along now.

798
01:22:02,468 --> 01:22:05,221
You ain't no more tired than I am.
Git along!

799
01:22:39,171 --> 01:22:40,506
Morning, ma'am.

800
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:59,150
Mrs. Spalding, I hate to be
the one to tell you this...

801
01:22:59,358 --> 01:23:03,404
but that sister of yours doesn't have
a natural talent for cooking.

802
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:15,374
I got to thinking, if we all weren't
gonna die of ptomaine poisoning...

803
01:23:15,583 --> 01:23:17,960
I'd have to do something about it.

804
01:23:24,049 --> 01:23:27,845
So I'm fixing us some green beans
like my mother used to make.

805
01:23:31,474 --> 01:23:32,933
Mrs. Spalding?

806
01:23:37,897 --> 01:23:39,523
Mrs. Spalding, are you okay?

807
01:23:43,986 --> 01:23:46,030
I was remembering a dream.

808
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,873
What day is this?

809
01:23:57,416 --> 01:23:58,959
It's Friday, ma'am.

810
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:03,589
When do we have to be at the gin?

811
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:07,384
Tomorrow morning.

812
01:25:12,908 --> 01:25:15,828
Recordings for The Blind presents:

813
01:25:16,036 --> 01:25:19,457
Trent's Last Case, by E.C. Bentley.

814
01:25:19,665 --> 01:25:22,543
Chapter one, "Bad News."

815
01:25:22,835 --> 01:25:26,088
"Between what matters
and what seems to matter...

816
01:25:26,297 --> 01:25:28,841
how should the world we know judge...?

817
01:25:41,312 --> 01:25:42,396
You all right?

818
01:26:29,485 --> 01:26:30,694
The end.

819
01:26:50,089 --> 01:26:51,257
Ma'am?

820
01:26:53,592 --> 01:26:54,385
Miz Spalding.

821
01:26:56,178 --> 01:26:57,471
Hey, Miz Spalding!

822
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:02,309
We're finished.

823
01:27:03,227 --> 01:27:04,145
We done it.

824
01:27:07,106 --> 01:27:09,108
He'll be here any minute.
Get this straight.

825
01:27:09,275 --> 01:27:11,569
He'll try to charge you
for ginning the cotton.

826
01:27:11,777 --> 01:27:13,404
I'll tell him no, do it for the seed.

827
01:27:13,612 --> 01:27:15,531
He'll say he'll take all the seed.

828
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,450
I say he can only have half.

829
01:27:17,658 --> 01:27:20,494
No, we offer a third
and settle for half.

830
01:27:20,703 --> 01:27:23,622
We gotta get 31/2 cent a pound,
even with the prize money.

831
01:27:23,789 --> 01:27:25,624
You gotta remember that...

832
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:28,043
Here he comes.

833
01:27:48,814 --> 01:27:50,524
- Howdy, Mrs. Spalding.
- Howdy, Mr. Simmons.

834
01:27:50,733 --> 01:27:53,277
Nice load of cotton.
You ought to be real proud.

835
01:27:53,486 --> 01:27:57,114
Let's go into my office
and see if we can do some business.

836
01:28:06,165 --> 01:28:07,625
Well, look who's here.

837
01:28:12,254 --> 01:28:13,672
Go on and have a seat.

838
01:28:15,174 --> 01:28:18,135
I ought to explain to you
how things work around here.

839
01:28:18,344 --> 01:28:23,307
I gin the cotton for a fee, then I buy
your cotton if we agree on a price.

840
01:28:23,516 --> 01:28:26,477
For ginning, it's customary
to charge $5 on the ton.

841
01:28:26,685 --> 01:28:28,145
Excuse me.

842
01:28:28,729 --> 01:28:32,024
I was told that you sometimes
gin the cotton for the seed.

843
01:28:32,233 --> 01:28:36,904
Yes, that's another way of working it.
I gin the cotton and keep the seed.

844
01:28:38,197 --> 01:28:41,992
The way it was explained to me,
you're supposed to keep...

845
01:28:42,701 --> 01:28:43,994
a third.

846
01:28:46,705 --> 01:28:49,959
I'll tell you right now,
I won't pay that. Excuse me.

847
01:28:51,377 --> 01:28:53,003
A little too much sun.

848
01:28:53,212 --> 01:28:57,341
Out of respect for your late husband,
I am prepared to go 50/50.

849
01:28:58,342 --> 01:28:59,176
Fine.

850
01:28:59,385 --> 01:29:02,805
I expect you realize the bottom
dropped out of the cotton market.

851
01:29:03,013 --> 01:29:06,267
I'm pretty much doing you a favor,
taking it off your hands.

852
01:29:07,726 --> 01:29:11,355
Mr. Simmons, I want 41/2 cents
a pound for my cotton.

853
01:29:11,564 --> 01:29:13,941
You don't want me, you want Santa Claus.

854
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:17,153
I'll pay you 2.75
and not a red cent more.

855
01:29:17,945 --> 01:29:18,863
Four?

856
01:29:19,488 --> 01:29:21,991
Maybe you haven't heard
about the Depression.

857
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:24,660
I can't pay that
or anything close to that.

858
01:29:24,869 --> 01:29:26,996
Three cents a pound,
take it or leave it.

859
01:29:31,542 --> 01:29:35,713
You know what your trouble is?
You're the victim of unbridled greed. 3.5.

860
01:29:38,758 --> 01:29:41,051
Ma'am, that is the honest price.

861
01:29:41,761 --> 01:29:42,887
That's it.

862
01:29:43,429 --> 01:29:45,347
I did my best. I tried to help.

863
01:29:45,556 --> 01:29:48,476
You can't blame me.
I can't do no more for you.

864
01:29:48,684 --> 01:29:52,605
Go on down to the square and see
how much you get for your cotton.

865
01:30:10,081 --> 01:30:11,207
Mr. Simmons?

866
01:30:14,168 --> 01:30:18,214
It just occurred to me. I was looking
at the pictures here on your wall.

867
01:30:18,422 --> 01:30:21,092
I remember how much store
your daddy set...

868
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,928
on ginning the first bale
of cotton each year.

869
01:30:26,889 --> 01:30:29,517
This'll be the first year
since I don't remember when...

870
01:30:29,725 --> 01:30:31,310
that y'all aren't first.

871
01:30:32,103 --> 01:30:36,857
I guess Mr. Wheeler at Wheeler's Gin
will be pleased to meet my price...

872
01:30:37,066 --> 01:30:39,985
just so he can show off
all next year at the Masons.

873
01:30:40,194 --> 01:30:41,320
Mrs. Spalding...

874
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:44,532
come back and sit down.

875
01:30:50,996 --> 01:30:53,374
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

876
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,294
Let's get this wagon to the loading bay.

877
01:30:57,503 --> 01:30:58,504
Well?

878
01:31:00,214 --> 01:31:02,299
What happened? How much did you get?

879
01:31:02,508 --> 01:31:05,302
3.75 cents per pound.

880
01:31:06,011 --> 01:31:07,805
That's more than market price.

881
01:31:08,013 --> 01:31:12,393
If we'd planted the other 10 acres in
cotton, think what we would've made.

882
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:14,395
We would've been dead.

883
01:31:14,603 --> 01:31:18,983
- Mr. Estes is selling 12 acres.
- Have you taken leave of your senses?

884
01:31:19,191 --> 01:31:22,236
- We'd have almost 60 acres of land.
- You can't afford that!

885
01:31:22,445 --> 01:31:24,321
We only need one crop of cotton.

886
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:28,284
Just one good crop, and we could
afford to buy us a tractor.

887
01:31:28,743 --> 01:31:29,577
A tractor.

888
01:31:30,536 --> 01:31:32,621
I always wanted to have a tractor.

889
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:37,042
I always thought if I had a tractor,
ain't no telling what I could do!

890
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:53,684
Mrs. Spalding?

891
01:31:56,562 --> 01:31:59,190
Could I trouble you for a cup of tea?

892
01:32:00,232 --> 01:32:02,526
Of course. I'll put
the water on for you.

893
01:32:05,613 --> 01:32:07,907
Do you mind if I wait in here?

894
01:32:08,115 --> 01:32:09,408
Not at all.

895
01:32:25,591 --> 01:32:29,053
Trying to fix Frank's shoe.
It's got a big hole in it.

896
01:32:34,475 --> 01:32:36,936
Mrs. Spalding, can I ask you a question?

897
01:32:42,441 --> 01:32:44,193
What do you look like?

898
01:32:57,581 --> 01:33:01,293
I have long hair
and I tie it up in the back.

899
01:33:02,169 --> 01:33:04,130
And I have brown eyes.

900
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,927
I always wanted to have blue eyes,
like my mama, but...

901
01:33:10,803 --> 01:33:12,847
Margaret got those.

902
01:33:16,767 --> 01:33:20,396
And my teeth stick out
in front a little...

903
01:33:23,858 --> 01:33:28,446
because I sucked my thumb
a long time when I was a little girl.

904
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:40,499
I'm no real beauty.

905
01:33:43,502 --> 01:33:44,795
I'm all right.

906
01:33:46,505 --> 01:33:47,715
Thank you.

907
01:33:52,511 --> 01:33:53,804
Your tea's ready.

908
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:08,527
All right, friends...

909
01:34:08,736 --> 01:34:12,406
one of our all-time favorites:
"A Golden Dream."

910
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:29,423
Mama?

911
01:34:30,716 --> 01:34:32,760
May I please have this dance?

912
01:34:36,764 --> 01:34:38,349
Frank Spalding...

913
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:41,185
I'd be most pleased.

914
01:34:53,697 --> 01:34:54,824
One...

915
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:20,766
Twenty-five dollars.

916
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:24,019
Miz Spalding give me $25.

917
01:35:24,437 --> 01:35:26,814
She ought not to have done that.

918
01:35:27,022 --> 01:35:31,110
She can't afford to go around...
What's the matter?

919
01:35:36,282 --> 01:35:37,867
I thought I heard something.

920
01:35:38,409 --> 01:35:40,911
Course you did. You heard me talking.

921
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:44,832
You ought to speak with her.
If she goes around spending money...

922
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,209
Moze, there's somebody out there.

923
01:35:48,002 --> 01:35:52,548
I don't expect so, but I'll go see,
just to make you feel better.

924
01:35:58,804 --> 01:36:01,682
Light's on in the barn. Be right back.

925
01:36:45,518 --> 01:36:46,352
Get him!

926
01:36:56,612 --> 01:36:57,863
Moze!

927
01:37:02,368 --> 01:37:03,536
Hold him!

928
01:37:08,207 --> 01:37:11,419
I'm gonna hit him again.
Get hold of him for me.

929
01:37:11,627 --> 01:37:12,670
Give me him!

930
01:37:18,342 --> 01:37:21,971
- Grab him! Come on!
- Goddamn nigger son of a bitch.

931
01:37:25,975 --> 01:37:26,851
Get him!

932
01:37:27,685 --> 01:37:28,936
Moze!

933
01:37:30,104 --> 01:37:32,356
Keep out of this.
It's none of your business.

934
01:37:32,565 --> 01:37:34,525
You move away from him right now.

935
01:37:34,984 --> 01:37:37,695
Put that away, Mr. Will,
before you hurt somebody.

936
01:37:37,903 --> 01:37:39,238
Goddamn!

937
01:37:41,532 --> 01:37:42,533
Now!

938
01:38:35,377 --> 01:38:38,756
Hold it, Mr. Will.
We don't have any quarrel with you.

939
01:38:38,964 --> 01:38:41,926
Mr. Thompson,
why are you doing this to him?

940
01:38:42,468 --> 01:38:44,929
You got the wrong man.
That ain't Thompson.

941
01:38:45,387 --> 01:38:49,391
That's Mr. Thompson.
I've been selling him brooms for years.

942
01:38:49,642 --> 01:38:51,435
As sure as you're Mr. Shaw.

943
01:38:51,644 --> 01:38:54,939
And that's Mr. Simmons
over there by the barn.

944
01:38:55,981 --> 01:38:57,900
All right, boys, let's go home.

945
01:39:12,706 --> 01:39:14,125
All right, nigger.

946
01:39:15,084 --> 01:39:17,044
But I ain't through with you yet.

947
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,387
- Want a Coke?
- No.

948
01:40:11,056 --> 01:40:13,058
Would you rather just go on home?

949
01:40:16,562 --> 01:40:18,147
Want to dance with me?

950
01:40:19,648 --> 01:40:21,025
I guess.

951
01:40:24,487 --> 01:40:25,696
You sure?

952
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:33,037
- Howdy, Wayne. Margaret.
- Hi, Mr. Cheeves.

953
01:40:33,245 --> 01:40:36,248
- Good evening.
- My, don't you two look nice together.

954
01:40:36,457 --> 01:40:37,875
Thank you, ma'am.

955
01:40:44,924 --> 01:40:47,301
Been a long time
since we danced together.

956
01:40:52,098 --> 01:40:53,766
That dress sure looks pretty.

957
01:40:54,225 --> 01:40:55,559
It's new.

958
01:40:56,018 --> 01:40:58,312
The color. I really like the color.

959
01:41:06,362 --> 01:41:09,073
What do I have to do
to tell you I'm sorry?

960
01:41:31,303 --> 01:41:33,097
He's out in the shack.

961
01:41:42,648 --> 01:41:43,482
Moze!

962
01:41:46,694 --> 01:41:48,112
Yes, ma'am.

963
01:41:55,077 --> 01:41:57,580
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to be
moving along.

964
01:41:57,830 --> 01:42:02,376
Won't be long before that bunch comes
back, and I'd best be gone by then.

965
01:42:03,419 --> 01:42:05,546
What am I gonna do without you?

966
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:13,679
I'd appreciate it if you say goodbye
to Frank and Possum for me.

967
01:42:14,013 --> 01:42:16,974
I'd soon as not have them
see me like this.

968
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:23,481
I been making on this doll for Possum.

969
01:42:23,689 --> 01:42:26,734
If you could give it to her,
I'd be most grateful.

970
01:42:27,568 --> 01:42:32,406
And old Frank, he had his eye
on this rabbit foot of mine for a spell...

971
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:35,576
so I expect he might as well have it.

972
01:42:38,704 --> 01:42:39,705
Here.

973
01:42:41,499 --> 01:42:43,084
This is for you.

974
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:47,254
It's a handkerchief belonged to my mama.

975
01:42:47,671 --> 01:42:49,799
I thought maybe you could use it.

976
01:42:57,014 --> 01:43:01,060
I reckon I got a bit more attached
to this place than I intended to.

977
01:43:05,231 --> 01:43:06,899
Well, Miz Spalding...

978
01:43:12,405 --> 01:43:13,948
I'm gonna miss you.

979
01:43:23,749 --> 01:43:25,084
Yes, ma'am.

980
01:43:26,377 --> 01:43:28,421
You took a no-account piece of land...

981
01:43:28,629 --> 01:43:31,257
and people that didn't know
what they were doing...

982
01:43:31,465 --> 01:43:34,593
and you farmed that land
better than anybody could...

983
01:43:34,802 --> 01:43:35,845
colored or white.

984
01:43:36,554 --> 01:43:39,723
You brought in the first bale
of cotton this year.

985
01:43:40,766 --> 01:43:43,060
Don't you ever forget that.

986
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:45,771
Yes, ma'am.

987
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:49,942
Reckon I did that.

988
01:43:55,573 --> 01:43:57,283
I reckon I did.

989
01:44:57,676 --> 01:45:00,721
This morning we take our text
from First Corinthians...

990
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:04,934
the 13th chapter,
verses one through eight.

991
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:09,772
"Though I speak with the tongues
of men and of angels...

992
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:11,816
and have not love...

993
01:45:12,024 --> 01:45:16,320
I am become as a sounding brass
or a tinkling cymbal.

994
01:45:17,238 --> 01:45:19,448
Though I have the gift of prophecy...

995
01:45:19,657 --> 01:45:24,370
and all knowledge and have not love,
I am nothing.

996
01:45:24,912 --> 01:45:29,834
And though I bestow all my goods
to feed the poor and have not love...

997
01:45:30,292 --> 01:45:32,628
it profiteth me nothing.

998
01:45:33,629 --> 01:45:38,551
Love is patient, kind.
Love is not jealous or boastful.

999
01:45:39,885 --> 01:45:42,346
Love never ends."

1000
01:46:03,659 --> 01:46:06,412
On the night before his crucifixion...

1001
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:09,415
our Lord gathered with his disciples.

1002
01:46:10,666 --> 01:46:13,043
He broke the bread and blessed it...

1003
01:46:13,252 --> 01:46:17,381
saying, "Take, eat. This is my body."

1004
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:19,967
And he took the cup and said:

1005
01:46:20,176 --> 01:46:24,513
"Drink. This is my blood
which I shed for thee."

1006
01:46:31,479 --> 01:46:32,730
Peace of God.

1007
01:46:58,380 --> 01:46:59,757
Peace of God.

1008
01:47:35,334 --> 01:47:36,544
Peace of God.

1009
01:47:38,087 --> 01:47:39,463
Peace of God.

1010
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,440
Peace of God.
