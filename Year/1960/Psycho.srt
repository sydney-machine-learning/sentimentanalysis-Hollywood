2
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,217
You never did eat your lunch,
did you?

3
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,471
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours...

4
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,473
give my boss excess acid.

5
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,391
Why don't you call your boss
and tell him...

6
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,727
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

7
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,188
It's Friday anyway,
and hot.

8
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:13,068
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

9
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,695
Well, we could laze
around here a while longer.

10
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,574
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.

11
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,078
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in...

12
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,580
but when your time is up...

13
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,375
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

14
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,377
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night...

15
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,170
in a cheap hotel.

16
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,216
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

17
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,885
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

18
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,055
Oh, Sam, this is
the last time.

19
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,684
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

20
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,437
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

21
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,315
You come down here
on business trips,

22
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,734
and we steal lunch hours.

23
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,821
I wish you
wouldn't even come.

24
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,574
What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

25
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,785
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

26
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,249
- I can come down next week.
- No.

27
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:14,421
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch in public?

28
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,633
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

29
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,635
But respectably.

30
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,596
In my house with my mother's
picture on the mantel and...

31
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,392
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

32
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,644
And after the steak, do we
send sister to the movies...

33
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,730
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

34
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,857
Sam!

35
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,236
All right.

36
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,911
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

37
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:51,499
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

38
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,919
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

39
00:04:55,003 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm all for it. It requires patience,
temperance, a lot of sweating out.

40
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:04,596
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

41
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:09,726
But if I can see you and touch you
even as simply as this, I won't mind it.

42
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,564
I'm tired of sweating
for people who aren't there.

43
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,567
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

44
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,528
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,
and she's living...

45
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,322
on the other side of the world.

46
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,200
I pay too.

47
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,412
They also pay
who meet in hotel rooms.

48
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,709
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

49
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,920
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

50
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,633
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- But when you do, you'll swing.

51
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,678
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

52
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:53,395
And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

53
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,022
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

54
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,734
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

55
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,570
I'll lick the stamps.

56
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:15,083
You want to cut this off, go out
and find yourself somebody available?

57
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,585
I'm thinking of it.

58
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,092
How could you even
think a thing like that?

59
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,928
- Don't miss your plane.
- We can leave together, can't we?

60
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,849
Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh,
you have to put your shoes on.

61
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,197
Isn't Mr. Lowery
back from lunch?

62
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,200
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

63
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,746
The old lease man. That's why
he's late. You got a headache?

64
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,749
It'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions...

65
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,251
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

66
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,254
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

67
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,215
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

68
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,302
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

69
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,471
Any calls?

70
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,850
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

71
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,228
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying...

72
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,606
and she'll be gone the whole weekend...

73
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:27,322
Wow. It's as hot
as fresh milk.

74
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:32,077
Hey, you girls oughta get your boss
to air condition ya up.

75
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,245
He can afford it today.

76
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,374
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

77
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,378
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my little girl.

78
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,798
Oh...Oh, not you.
My daughter.

79
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,217
A baby.

80
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:52,180
Tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

81
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:57,143
I want you to take a look at my baby.

82
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,647
Eighteen years old...

83
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,360
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

84
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,571
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.

85
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,157
Do you know what I do
about unhappiness?

86
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,785
I buy it off.

87
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,246
Are, uh...
Are you unhappy?

88
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,332
Uh, not inordinately.

89
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,839
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

90
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,591
Forty thousand
dollars cash.

91
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,554
Now that's...
that's not buying happiness.

92
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,974
That's just buying off unhappiness.

93
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,354
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

94
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,690
- Count 'em!
- I declare!

95
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,402
I don't. That's how
I get to keep it.

96
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,614
Tom, a cash transaction
of this size is most irregular.

97
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,409
Ah, so what?
It's my private money.

98
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,746
- Now it's yours.
- Suppose we put it in the safe,

99
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,166
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

100
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:06,296
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said was in your desk?

101
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,383
Uh-oh.

102
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,971
You know, uh, sometimes
I can keep my mouth shut.

103
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,438
Lowery, I am dying
of "thirst-aroonie."

104
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,818
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

105
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,782
Put it in the safe deposit box in the
bank, and we'll get a check on Monday.

106
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,451
Yes.

107
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,876
He was flirting with you. I guess
he must've noticed my wedding ring.

108
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,183
Come in.

109
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,897
The copies. If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home after the bank.

110
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,358
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

111
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,361
Because me and your boss are goin'out
and get ourselves...

112
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,363
a little drinkin'done, right?

113
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,199
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

114
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,829
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

115
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,206
I'm going to spend this weekend
in bed. Thank you.

116
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:30,422
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

117
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,800
Can't buy off unhappiness
with pills.

118
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,847
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

119
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:44,347
Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?

120
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,183
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.

121
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,187
What is it, Marion?

122
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,412
Uh, hold it there.

123
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,919
In quite a hurry.

124
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:43,508
I didn't intend to sleep so long. I
almost had an accident from sleepiness.

125
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,262
- So, I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

126
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,224
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

127
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,728
There are plenty of motels
in this area. You should've...

128
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,980
I mean, just to be safe.

129
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,983
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over.

130
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,068
Have I broken any laws?

131
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,362
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

132
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,575
Is anything wrong?

133
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,328
Of course not. Am I acting
as if there's something wrong?

134
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:17,375
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

135
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,128
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

136
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,383
I've told you there's nothing wrong,
except I'm in a hurry...

137
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,385
and you're taking up my time.

138
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,304
Now, just a moment.

139
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,932
Turn your motor off, please.

140
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,894
May I see your license?

141
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,566
- Why?
- Please.

142
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,736
Be with you in a second!

143
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,468
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

144
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,555
There's an old saying: "First customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

145
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,598
But I'm in no mood for it,

146
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,976
so I'm gonna treat you so fair
you won't have one reason...

147
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,730
- Can I trade my car and take another?
- Do anything you have a mind to.

148
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,774
Bein'a woman, you will.
That yours?

149
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,569
Yes, it's, it's...There's
nothing wrong with it. I just...

150
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,571
Sick of the sight of it.

151
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,074
Have a look around and see if there's
something that strikes your eyes,

152
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,577
and I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

153
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,579
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...

154
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,414
and just wanna make a change.

155
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,166
One thing people never oughta be
when they're buyin'used cars...

156
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,626
and that's in a hurry, but like I said,
it's too nice a day to argue.

157
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,756
I'll shoot your car
in the garage here.

158
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,737
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

159
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,447
- How much?
- Go ahead.

160
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,199
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

161
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,201
How much would it be
with my car?

162
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,412
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

163
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:08,875
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasin'ya?

164
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,877
Of course not.
Please.

165
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,841
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high pressured the salesman.

166
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:21,346
Ah, I figure roughly...

167
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,516
your car plus $700.

168
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,020
- Seven hundred.
- You always got time to argue money.

169
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,147
All right.

170
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,154
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

171
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,491
I mean, out-of-state license.
You got your pink slip...

172
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,786
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies room?

173
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,706
In the building.

174
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,260
Over there.

175
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,319
I think you better take it
for a trial spin.

176
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,113
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

177
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,116
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this...

178
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:09,371
I might as well be perfectly honest with
you. It's not that I don't trust you...

179
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:12,957
But what? Is there
anything so terribly wrong...

180
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,585
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

181
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,963
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

182
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,592
All right,
let's go inside.

183
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,714
Hey!

184
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,432
Just put it in here, please.

185
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,728
Thank you.

186
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:25,196
Heck, Officer,
that was the first time...

187
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,033
I saw the customer
high pressure the salesman.

188
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,035
Somebody chasin'her?

189
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,038
I better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.

190
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:37,292
- She look like a wrong one to you?
- Acted like one.

191
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:41,588
The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

192
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,806
Yes, Mr. Lowery.

193
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:54,225
Caroline. Marion still isn't in?

194
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,937
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

195
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:01,524
Buzz me the minute
she comes in.

196
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,903
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.

197
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:09,366
I called her sister where she works...
The Music Makers Music Store...

198
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,202
and she doesn't know where Marion
is any more than we do.

199
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,997
You better run out to the house. She may
be, well, unable to answer the phone.

200
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,417
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

201
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,465
No, I haven't the faintest idea.

202
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,551
As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

203
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:32,222
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.

204
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:35,016
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.

205
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:38,436
I did see her
some time later driving...

206
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,524
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

207
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,610
Caroline,
get Mr. Cassidy for me.

208
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:51,825
After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!

209
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,285
I'm not taking
the responsibility.

210
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:58,790
Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works
for you for ten years, you trust her.

211
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,792
All right, yes,
you better come over.

212
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:06,423
Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $40,000!

213
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,550
I'll get it back, and if any of it's
missin', I'll replace it...

214
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,552
with her fine, soft flesh!

215
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,596
- We'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

216
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,893
I still can't believe...It must be
some kind of a mystery. l, I can't...

217
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,230
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

218
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:26,443
You still trustin'? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!

219
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:31,281
Hardly even looked at it. Plannin'.
And, and even flirtin'with me!

220
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:01,473
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.

221
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,897
- Dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

222
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:13,234
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
12 cabins, 12 vacancies.

223
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,654
They, uh...They moved
away the highway.

224
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:20,575
Oh, I thought I'd gotten
off the main road.

225
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:25,789
I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops
here anymore unless they've done that.

226
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:29,751
But...there's no sense
dwelling on our losses.

227
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:34,047
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

228
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:41,471
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

229
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:47,102
Los Angeles.

230
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:57,987
Cabin one. It's closer in case you want
anything. It's right next to the office.

231
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,907
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

232
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:04,411
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

233
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:09,207
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

234
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,520
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

235
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,862
Well, the, uh, mattress
is soft and...

236
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:41,156
there's hangers in the closet
and stationery...

237
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,199
with "Bates Motel"
printed on it...

238
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:46,995
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

239
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:49,039
And the, uh...

240
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,084
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

241
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,545
Yeah.

242
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:59,924
Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything,
just...just tap on the wall.

243
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,926
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.

244
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,471
Norman Bates.

245
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:10,393
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

246
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,896
- No.
- Then would you do me a favor?

247
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,731
Would you have dinner with me?

248
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:19,277
I was just about to myself. Nothing
special...just sandwiches and milk.

249
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:23,073
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

250
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:26,576
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

251
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,246
- I'd like to.
- All right.

252
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,999
You get yourself settled and,
and take off your wet shoes.

253
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,586
- I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
- Okay.

254
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,256
With my...With my trusty umbrella.

255
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:03,131
No! I tell you no!

256
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:06,259
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

257
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:10,221
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion...

258
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:13,892
- Of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
- Mother, please.

259
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:17,354
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

260
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,565
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

261
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:26,112
"Mother, she's just a stranger." As if
men don't desire strangers. As if...

262
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:30,784
Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

263
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,078
Do you understand, boy?
Go on.

264
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:36,206
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite...

265
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,917
with my food or my son!

266
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,003
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

267
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:46,591
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

268
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:31,886
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No, uh...

269
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,848
Mother...
My mother, uh...

270
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,684
What is the phrase?

271
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:40,937
She isn't quite
herself today.

272
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:46,276
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

273
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,029
Oh, I'm sorry.

274
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:54,492
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

275
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:56,494
Don't worry about it.

276
00:33:56,578 --> 00:34:00,498
But as long as you've fixed
the supper, we may as well eat it.

277
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:14,804
It, uh...It might be, uh, nicer
and warmer in the office.

278
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,445
Well, it stopped
raining.

279
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:34,574
Uh, eating in an office
is just...just too officious.

280
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:37,619
- I have the parlor back here.
- All right.

281
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:55,929
- Sit down.
- Oh, thank you.

282
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:02,102
You're very kind.

283
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:06,022
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

284
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,738
You...You eat like a bird.

285
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:18,326
And you'd know,
of course.

286
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,328
No, not really.

287
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:23,790
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"...

288
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:28,336
is really a fal...
false...falsity.

289
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,007
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

290
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:39,014
But I really don't know anything about
birds. My hobby is stuffing things.

291
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:41,016
You know, taxidermy.

292
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:45,645
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because...

293
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,106
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

294
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:50,150
You know,
foxes and chimps.

295
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:54,404
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

296
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,866
I think only birds
look well stuffed because...

297
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:01,536
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

298
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,539
It's a strange hobby.
Curious.

299
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:08,209
- Uncommon too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

300
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:12,005
And it's...it's not as expensive
as you'd think. It's cheap, really.

301
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,799
You know, needles
and thread, sawdust.

302
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,385
The chemicals are the only
thing that, that cost anything.

303
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:20,472
A man should have a hobby.

304
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:24,434
Well, it's...
it's more than a hobby.

305
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:29,731
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

306
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:32,609
Is your time so empty?

307
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:35,403
No. Uh...

308
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,739
Well, I run the office...

309
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,116
and tend the cabins
and grounds...

310
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:43,036
and do little, uh,
errands for my mother...

311
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,914
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

312
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:49,084
Do you go out with friends?

313
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:53,922
Well, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

314
00:36:56,424 --> 00:37:00,887
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

315
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:07,686
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

316
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,313
I didn't mean to pry.

317
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:13,108
I'm looking for
a private island.

318
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,071
What are you
running away from?

319
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:23,952
- Why do you ask that?
- No.

320
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,454
People never run away
from anything.

321
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:33,169
The rain didn't last long,
did it? You know what I think?

322
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,714
I think that...

323
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,843
we're all in
our private traps,

324
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:45,223
clamped in them, and none of us
can ever get out.

325
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,227
We scratch and...
and claw,

326
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,231
but only at the air,
only at each other.

327
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:58,153
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

328
00:37:58,236 --> 00:38:00,739
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

329
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,286
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it anymore.

330
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,706
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

331
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:12,375
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

332
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:19,591
You know, if anyone ever talked
to me the way I heard...

333
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:23,303
the way she spoke to you...

334
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:27,432
Sometimes when she talks
to me like that,

335
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:31,895
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and, and leave her forever.

336
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:34,439
Or at least defy her.

337
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:43,198
But I know I can't.
She's ill.

338
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:47,369
She sounded strong.

339
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,996
No, I mean...ill.

340
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:55,335
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

341
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:59,089
I was only five and it,
it must've been quite a strain for her.

342
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:03,051
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or
anything. He left her a little money.

343
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:07,639
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

344
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:11,142
And he...he talked her
into building this motel.

345
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:14,354
He could have talked her
into anything.

346
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:18,525
And when he died too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

347
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:21,945
And the way
he died...

348
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:28,410
I guess it's nothing to talk about
while you're eating.

349
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:33,081
Anyway, it was just too great
a loss for her. She had nothing left.

350
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,500
Except you.

351
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:38,670
Well, a son is a poor substitute
for a lover.

352
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:43,299
Why don't you go away?

353
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:45,677
To a private island,
like you?

354
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,600
No...not like me.

355
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:56,813
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

356
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,733
She'd be alone up there.

357
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:03,945
The fire would go out.

358
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:07,866
It'd be cold and damp
like a grave.

359
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:12,203
If you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them.

360
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:18,460
You understand, l...
I don't hate her.

361
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:22,630
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.

362
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:29,846
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her...some place?

363
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,479
You mean an institution?
A madhouse?

364
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:44,652
People always call a madhouse
"some place," don't they?

365
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,780
Put her in "some place."

366
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,493
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

367
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:53,995
What do you know
about caring?

368
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,248
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

369
00:40:57,374 --> 00:41:01,002
The laughing and the tears...

370
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:03,505
and the cruel eyes
studying you.

371
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:05,548
My mother there?

372
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:10,595
But she's harmless.

373
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:14,974
She's as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds.

374
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:18,937
I am sorry.

375
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:23,233
I only felt...
It seems she's hurting you.

376
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:28,905
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

377
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:32,617
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest...

378
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,744
oh, so very delicately...

379
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:45,422
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

380
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:50,051
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.

381
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:59,352
It...It's not as if she were
a...a maniac, a raving thing.

382
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,980
She...

383
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:05,150
She just goes
a little mad sometimes.

384
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:10,572
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

385
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:14,576
Haven't you?

386
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,747
Yes.

387
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:24,169
Sometimes just one time
can be enough. Thank you.

388
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:27,339
Thank you, "Norman."

389
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:30,216
Norman.

390
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:33,720
Oh, you're not...you're not
going back to your room already?

391
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,556
I'm very tired.

392
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,726
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

393
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:41,561
Really?

394
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:44,939
I stepped into a private trap
back there...

395
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:49,486
and I'd like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it...

396
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,740
before it's too late
for me too.

397
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,202
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay a little while longer?

398
00:42:57,285 --> 00:43:00,955
- I mean, just for talk.
- Oh, I'd like to, but...

399
00:43:00,997 --> 00:43:03,416
All right. Well,
I'll see you in the morning.

400
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,418
I'll bring you some breakfast,
all right?

401
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:08,588
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

402
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,840
All right, Miss, uh...

403
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,926
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

404
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:15,220
Good night.

405
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:25,553
Ow! No!

406
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:27,972
No! Aaah!

407
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,555
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

408
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,142
Blood! Blood!

409
01:00:01,726 --> 01:00:04,145
I've tried many brands.

410
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:07,982
So far, of those I've used, I haven't
had much luck with any of them.

411
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:10,985
Let's see what they say
about this one.

412
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:13,530
They tell you
what its ingredients are...

413
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:17,534
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

414
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:20,453
but they do not tell you
whether it's painless.

415
01:00:20,537 --> 01:00:24,374
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

416
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:28,378
This one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others.

417
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:42,142
Sam?

418
01:00:42,225 --> 01:00:45,228
Sam!
Lady wants to see ya.

419
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:53,737
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

420
01:00:53,778 --> 01:00:56,573
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

421
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,952
- Well, of course not. Something wrong?
- Thank you.

422
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:06,875
She left home on Friday.

423
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:10,420
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

424
01:01:10,545 --> 01:01:13,006
Not even a phone call.

425
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:16,551
If you two are in this together,
it's none of my business,

426
01:01:16,634 --> 01:01:19,763
but I want Marion to tell me it's none
of my business and then I'll go...

427
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:23,391
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will ya?

428
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:26,519
- That's okay. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

429
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:35,445
Now, what thing
could we be in together?

430
01:01:35,528 --> 01:01:37,655
Sorry about the tears.

431
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:40,992
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

432
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,995
Let's all talk about
Marion, shall we?

433
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:49,501
Who are you, friend?

434
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:51,795
My name is Arbogast, friend.

435
01:01:51,878 --> 01:01:54,714
I'm a private investigator.

436
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:58,468
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

437
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:02,555
I know you don't, because if you did
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

438
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:05,058
What's your interest
in this?

439
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,269
Well, $40,000.

440
01:02:09,604 --> 01:02:11,523
- $40,000?
- That's right.

441
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:18,738
One of you'd better tell me what's going
on, and fast. I can take so much...

442
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,740
Now, take it easy,
friend.

443
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:24,619
It's just that your girlfriend
stole $40,000.

444
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:27,122
What are you talking about?
What is this?

445
01:02:27,205 --> 01:02:31,668
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss, and she didn't.

446
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:34,921
- No one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

447
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:37,549
Someone always sees a girl
with $40,000.

448
01:02:37,632 --> 01:02:40,969
They don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

449
01:02:41,052 --> 01:02:43,972
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

450
01:02:44,055 --> 01:02:47,851
Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come
up here on a hunch and nothing more?

451
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:50,812
Oh, not even a hunch.
Just hope.

452
01:02:50,895 --> 01:02:54,649
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

453
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:57,652
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

454
01:02:57,736 --> 01:03:00,822
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

455
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:03,867
Did you check Phoenix?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

456
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:09,080
No, she was seen leaving town in her
own car...by her employer, I might add.

457
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:11,708
I can't believe it.
Can you?

458
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:15,712
We're always quickest
to doubt people...

459
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:18,214
who have a reputation
for being honest.

460
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,592
I think she's here,
Miss Crane.

461
01:03:20,675 --> 01:03:23,094
Where there's
a boyfriend...

462
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:28,099
She's not back there with the nuts and
bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.

463
01:03:28,183 --> 01:03:31,102
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

464
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:09,808
- Evening.
- Evening.

465
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:11,810
I almost drove
right past.

466
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:15,146
I'm always forgetting to turn
the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

467
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:18,108
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.

468
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:20,110
- Candy?
- No, thanks.

469
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:24,114
Last two days I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

470
01:04:24,155 --> 01:04:27,617
but this is the first place that looks
like it's hiding from the world.

471
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:30,620
To tell the truth, I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

472
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:33,623
-Just doesn't seem like any use anymore.
-Oh?

473
01:04:33,707 --> 01:04:37,085
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

474
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:40,088
- Wanna register?
- Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

475
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:43,091
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No trouble. Today's linen day.

476
01:04:43,174 --> 01:04:46,094
I always change the beds once a week
whether they've been used or not.

477
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:50,724
Hate the smell of dampness. It's such a,
I don't know...creepy smell.

478
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:54,060
You out to buy a motel?

479
01:04:55,562 --> 01:04:57,522
No.

480
01:04:57,564 --> 01:05:00,275
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen
so many the past couple of days,

481
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:02,152
I thought maybe...

482
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:05,155
What, uh...What was it
you wanted to ask?

483
01:05:05,196 --> 01:05:07,741
I'm looking for
a missing person.

484
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:10,785
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

485
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:13,329
I've been trying
to trace a girl...

486
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:16,750
that's been missing for,
oh, about a week now from Phoenix.

487
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:19,711
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

488
01:05:19,794 --> 01:05:21,713
She's not
in any trouble.

489
01:05:21,796 --> 01:05:24,716
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

490
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,843
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

491
01:05:26,926 --> 01:05:31,473
We have reason to believe she came
along this way. Did she stop here?

492
01:05:31,556 --> 01:05:34,517
No one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

493
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,519
Mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?

494
01:05:36,561 --> 01:05:38,063
Commit myself?

495
01:05:38,104 --> 01:05:41,483
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

496
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:45,153
- Mm-mmm. Yeah.
- Sure?

497
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:48,156
Well, she may have
used an alias.

498
01:05:48,198 --> 01:05:50,158
Marion Crane's
her real name,

499
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,661
but she could've registered
under a different one.

500
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:57,832
I tell ya, I don't even much bother
with guests registering anymore.

501
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,794
One by one,
you drop the formalities.

502
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:04,839
I shouldn't even bother changing
the sheets, but old habits die hard.

503
01:06:04,964 --> 01:06:07,759
Which reminds me...

504
01:06:08,718 --> 01:06:10,637
- What's that?
- The sign.

505
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:14,015
A couple last week said
if the thing hadn't been on,

506
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:17,018
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

507
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:19,229
You see,
that's exactly my point.

508
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:21,731
Nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks,

509
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:25,735
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

510
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,862
As you say,
old habits die hard.

511
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:31,783
This girl could've registered
under another name. Mind if I look?

512
01:06:31,866 --> 01:06:34,119
- No.
- Thank you.

513
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:38,164
All right.

514
01:06:38,206 --> 01:06:41,960
I'll get the date
somewhere. Mm-hmm.

515
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,504
See, there's nobody.

516
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:48,008
Let's see, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

517
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:51,302
Oh, yes.

518
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:53,304
Here we are.

519
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:55,306
- Marie Samuels.
- Hmm.

520
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:57,308
That's an interesting alias.

521
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:59,811
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

522
01:06:59,894 --> 01:07:01,813
Marie, Marion.

523
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:05,066
- Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
- Mm-hmm.

524
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:09,946
Mm-hmm. Was she
in disguise, by any chance?

525
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:13,658
- Wanna check the picture again?
- I wasn't lying to you.

526
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:16,661
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

527
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:18,621
It's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

528
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:19,998
I know.

529
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,083
Oh, yeah.

530
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:27,339
Well, i-i-it was raining
and, um, her hair was all wet.

531
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:29,341
I tell ya, it's not really
a very good picture of her.

532
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:31,051
No, I guess not.

533
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:33,053
Tell me all about her.

534
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:35,263
Well, um,

535
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:39,476
she arrived, um, rather late
one night, went straight to sleep...

536
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:42,103
and, uh, left early
the next morning.

537
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:45,315
- How early?
- Oh, ex...very early.

538
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:48,610
Mm-hmm.
Which morning was that?

539
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:50,612
Uh, the, um...

540
01:07:50,695 --> 01:07:53,948
Th-Th-Th-The next morning.

541
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:56,326
- Sunday.
- I see. Mm-hmm.

542
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:58,328
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

543
01:07:58,411 --> 01:08:01,122
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

544
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:03,958
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

545
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,960
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

546
01:08:06,002 --> 01:08:09,964
- Did you spend the night with her?
- No.

547
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:13,301
Then how would you know
she didn't make any calls?

548
01:08:15,553 --> 01:08:17,639
Uh, w-w...

549
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:19,933
Well, she was very tired
a-and, uh...

550
01:08:20,016 --> 01:08:22,769
See, l...N-Now I'm staring
to, um...remember.

551
01:08:22,852 --> 01:08:25,313
l-I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

552
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:28,483
- If you make a mental picturization...
- Right. Take your time.

553
01:08:28,525 --> 01:08:31,736
Um, she was...
she was sitting back there...

554
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:34,739
N-No, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand.

555
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:37,742
She said she had to
go to sleep early...

556
01:08:37,784 --> 01:08:41,955
because she had a long d-d-dr-drive,
uh, ahead of her.

557
01:08:41,996 --> 01:08:44,708
- Mm-hmm. Back where?
- Back where she came from.

558
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:47,502
No, you said before she
was standing back there...

559
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:49,546
Yes, b-back in my parlor.

560
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:52,549
She was very hungry,
I made her a sandwich...

561
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:57,429
and then she said she was tired and
she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.

562
01:08:57,512 --> 01:08:59,431
I see.
How did she pay you?

563
01:08:59,514 --> 01:09:01,224
- Cash? Check?
- Cash.

564
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:03,268
Cash, huh?
Mm-hmm.

565
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:07,897
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Uh-uh. Why should she?

566
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:12,569
Hmm.

567
01:09:12,652 --> 01:09:16,072
Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh,
I guess that's about it.

568
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:19,701
l-I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

569
01:09:19,784 --> 01:09:22,746
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

570
01:09:22,787 --> 01:09:26,166
See, if it doesn't jell,
it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.

571
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:29,169
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

572
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:32,672
Well, l-l-I don't know
what you c-could expect me to know.

573
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:34,716
People just come and go,
you know.

574
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:37,218
That's right.
She isn't still here, is she?

575
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,054
No.

576
01:09:39,137 --> 01:09:44,726
If I wanted to check the cabins, all
twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

577
01:09:44,809 --> 01:09:48,271
If you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

578
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:50,315
Oh. No, thanks.

579
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:09,209
Uh, change your mind?

580
01:10:10,919 --> 01:10:12,837
Oh.

581
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:16,716
You know, l...I think I have one of
those faces you can't help believing.

582
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,677
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

583
01:10:18,718 --> 01:10:21,346
Oh? There's somebody
sitting in the window.

584
01:10:21,429 --> 01:10:23,515
- N-N-No, there isn't.
- Sure. Take a look.

585
01:10:23,598 --> 01:10:25,600
Oh, th-that must be
my mother.

586
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:28,103
She's an, uh, "inavlid..."
an invalid.

587
01:10:28,144 --> 01:10:30,647
Uh, it's practically
like living alone.

588
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:32,774
Oh, I see.

589
01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:37,612
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

590
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:40,115
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

591
01:10:40,156 --> 01:10:42,200
No.

592
01:10:42,283 --> 01:10:47,038
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

593
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:49,207
You'd know
you were being used.

594
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:52,210
- You wouldn't be made a fool of.
- I'm not a fool.

595
01:10:52,293 --> 01:10:54,838
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

596
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:57,841
- This is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

597
01:10:57,924 --> 01:11:01,261
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

598
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:04,264
Then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

599
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:06,391
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

600
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:10,353
Just for a few minutes. There might be
some hint that you missed out on.

601
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:13,606
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

602
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,608
- I wouldn't disturb her.
- Mr. Arbogast, l-I think I've...

603
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:19,154
- I think I've talked to you all I want.
- Yes, but just for...

604
01:11:19,195 --> 01:11:22,157
It'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

605
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:24,242
Well, all right.

606
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:28,204
You sure would save me a lot of
leg work if you'd let me talk to her.

607
01:11:28,246 --> 01:11:31,374
- Would I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

608
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:33,376
All right.
Thanks, anyway.

609
01:12:27,722 --> 01:12:31,184
Hello, Loomis.
This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?

610
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:33,728
Let me talk to her, please.

611
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:37,107
Hello, Lila.

612
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:40,944
Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

613
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:43,947
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

614
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:45,949
It's out
on the old highway.

615
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:49,536
I even know what cabin she was in...
it was number one.

616
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:53,873
Well, this young fella that runs
the place said she just spent the night,

617
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:56,626
left the next day
and that was it.

618
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:00,130
Mmm.
Um, no, not exactly.

619
01:13:01,881 --> 01:13:03,717
Well, I did question him,
believe me,

620
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:06,720
but I think I got
all there was to get.

621
01:13:06,761 --> 01:13:09,723
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

622
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:13,268
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...

623
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:16,354
See, this boy
had a sick old mother.

624
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:19,315
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

625
01:13:19,357 --> 01:13:22,736
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

626
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:27,282
Well, I was, but I think I'll go
back to the motel first.

627
01:13:27,365 --> 01:13:31,119
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

628
01:13:31,202 --> 01:13:33,121
All right, fine.
Listen, l...

629
01:13:33,204 --> 01:13:36,124
You'll be happy to know
what I think.

630
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:40,086
Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

631
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:44,549
All right. See ya
in about an hour...or less.

632
01:13:44,632 --> 01:13:46,551
All right, bye-bye.

633
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,150
Bates?

634
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:21,391
Sometimes Saturday night has a Ionely
sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

635
01:17:23,518 --> 01:17:26,438
Sam, he said
an hour or less.

636
01:17:26,521 --> 01:17:28,732
Yeah.

637
01:17:28,773 --> 01:17:30,734
It's been three.

638
01:17:30,775 --> 01:17:32,902
Are we just
going to sit here and wait?

639
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:35,113
He'll be back.

640
01:17:35,196 --> 01:17:37,699
Let's sit still
and hang on, okay?

641
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,041
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

642
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:48,543
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.
- Yes.

643
01:17:48,626 --> 01:17:50,879
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

644
01:17:50,962 --> 01:17:53,882
- That wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.

645
01:17:53,965 --> 01:17:55,884
- I'm going out there.
- Arbogast said...

646
01:17:55,967 --> 01:17:57,886
An hour, or less.

647
01:18:01,556 --> 01:18:03,475
Well, I'm going.

648
01:18:03,558 --> 01:18:05,518
You'll never find it.

649
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,107
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go?

650
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:15,111
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

651
01:18:15,153 --> 01:18:17,530
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

652
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:19,199
Yeah. Stay here.

653
01:18:39,552 --> 01:18:41,471
Arbogast?

654
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:44,474
Arbogast!

655
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:49,270
Arbogast!

656
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:21,011
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

657
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:24,431
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

658
01:19:24,514 --> 01:19:27,809
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door...or unwilling.

659
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:29,894
Where could he
have gone?

660
01:19:29,936 --> 01:19:31,896
Maybe he got
some definite lead.

661
01:19:31,938 --> 01:19:33,898
- Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?

662
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,900
- In a hurry.
- Sam, he called...

663
01:19:35,942 --> 01:19:37,902
when he had nothing
but a dissatisfied feeling.

664
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:41,906
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

665
01:19:41,948 --> 01:19:43,908
Yes, I think
he would've.

666
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:46,202
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

667
01:19:46,244 --> 01:19:49,706
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- Let me get my coat.

668
01:19:57,922 --> 01:19:59,841
Good evening.

669
01:19:59,924 --> 01:20:04,012
Well, l...I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

670
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,056
Yes.

671
01:20:06,097 --> 01:20:09,059
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

672
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:12,062
She's been here
searching for her sister.

673
01:20:12,103 --> 01:20:14,064
There's this
private detective helping.

674
01:20:14,105 --> 01:20:16,733
We got a call from this
detective...he'd traced her...

675
01:20:16,858 --> 01:20:18,777
to that motel
on the old highway.

676
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,653
That must be
the Bates Motel.

677
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:23,782
He called to say he was going
to question Mrs. Bates.

678
01:20:23,865 --> 01:20:25,825
Norman took a wife?

679
01:20:25,867 --> 01:20:29,371
No, l-I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

680
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:32,499
That was early this evening. We
haven't seen or heard from him since.

681
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:36,169
Now, your sister's
missing how long?

682
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:39,255
She left Phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace.

683
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:43,051
How'd you and this detective come
to trace her to Fairvale?

684
01:20:43,093 --> 01:20:45,261
They thought
she'd be coming to me.

685
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:47,764
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

686
01:20:47,847 --> 01:20:49,766
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

687
01:20:49,849 --> 01:20:51,768
That's right.

688
01:20:51,851 --> 01:20:53,770
From what?

689
01:20:55,563 --> 01:20:57,524
She stole some money.

690
01:20:57,565 --> 01:20:59,567
A lot?

691
01:20:59,651 --> 01:21:01,569
Forty thousand dollars.

692
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:03,697
The police haven't
been able to...

693
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:07,367
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

694
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:10,370
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

695
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:12,372
That explains
the private detective.

696
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:14,416
He traced her
to the Bates place.

697
01:21:14,499 --> 01:21:17,419
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

698
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:20,755
He said Marion was there
for one night, then she left.

699
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:22,632
- With the $40,000?
- He didn't say anything...

700
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:25,135
about the money.

701
01:21:25,218 --> 01:21:27,637
It isn't important
what he said, is it?

702
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:31,516
He was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

703
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:33,643
That's what I want you
to do something about.

704
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:35,145
Like what?

705
01:21:35,228 --> 01:21:37,689
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

706
01:21:37,731 --> 01:21:41,484
I'm sure there's something wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

707
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:45,321
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, Miss, but not the same thing.

708
01:21:45,363 --> 01:21:48,324
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

709
01:21:48,366 --> 01:21:52,495
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was goin',

710
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,539
probably from Norman Bates,

711
01:21:54,622 --> 01:21:57,834
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

712
01:21:57,917 --> 01:22:02,380
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

713
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:04,382
Call Norman and let him
say what happened.

714
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:06,384
At this hour?

715
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:11,097
He was out when I was there a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.

716
01:22:11,181 --> 01:22:14,059
He wasn't out; he just wasn't answerin'
the door in the dead of night,

717
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,061
like some people do.

718
01:22:16,102 --> 01:22:18,980
This fellow lives
like a hermit.

719
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:21,858
You must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago.

720
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,818
Please. Call.

721
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:33,453
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

722
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:42,754
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

723
01:22:42,837 --> 01:22:45,757
Ye...I been
just fine, thanks.

724
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,468
Listen, we got
worries here.

725
01:22:48,551 --> 01:22:51,971
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

726
01:22:53,223 --> 01:22:55,684
Well, this one
wouldn't be a customer.

727
01:22:55,725 --> 01:22:58,728
- A private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

728
01:22:58,853 --> 01:23:00,772
Arbogast.

729
01:23:03,274 --> 01:23:05,193
And after he left?

730
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,073
No, that's...
that's okay, Norman.

731
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:15,745
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

732
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:18,748
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

733
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:22,085
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

734
01:23:22,168 --> 01:23:25,088
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back...

735
01:23:25,171 --> 01:23:28,508
because he was going to question
Norman Bates'mother, right?

736
01:23:28,591 --> 01:23:30,552
Yes.

737
01:23:30,593 --> 01:23:33,430
Norman Bates'mother
has been dead and buried...

738
01:23:33,513 --> 01:23:37,767
in Greenlawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

739
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:41,521
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

740
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:43,523
'Tain't only
local history, Sam.

741
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:47,444
It's the only case of murder
and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

742
01:23:47,527 --> 01:23:51,322
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was...involved with...

743
01:23:51,364 --> 01:23:53,825
when she found out
he was married,

744
01:23:53,908 --> 01:23:57,120
then took a helpin'of
the same stuff herself.

745
01:23:57,203 --> 01:24:00,790
Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.

746
01:24:00,874 --> 01:24:03,626
Norman found them
dead together.

747
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:06,588
In bed.

748
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:09,049
You mean that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window wasn't Bates'mother?

749
01:24:09,132 --> 01:24:13,720
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

750
01:24:13,803 --> 01:24:16,181
Yes! In the house
behind the motel!

751
01:24:16,264 --> 01:24:18,475
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

752
01:24:18,558 --> 01:24:21,061
You saw
Norman Bates'mother?

753
01:24:21,102 --> 01:24:24,731
But it had to be...
because Arbogast said so too!

754
01:24:24,814 --> 01:24:28,526
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

755
01:24:28,568 --> 01:24:32,447
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs. Bates,

756
01:24:32,489 --> 01:24:36,117
who's that woman buried
out in Greenlawn Cemetery?

757
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:23,039
Now, Mother, um...
l-I'm gonna bring something up...

758
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:25,709
I am sorry, boy,

759
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:29,379
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

760
01:25:29,462 --> 01:25:31,339
Please, Mother.

761
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:34,509
No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

762
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,721
Ha! You think
I'm fruity, huh?

763
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:39,848
I'm staying right here.

764
01:25:39,931 --> 01:25:42,976
This is my room and
no one will drag me out of it,

765
01:25:43,059 --> 01:25:45,562
least of all
my big, bold son.

766
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:47,605
They'll come now, Mother.

767
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:51,359
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

768
01:25:51,484 --> 01:25:55,613
Mother, please, it's just for
a few days so they won't find you.

769
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:57,866
Just for a few days?

770
01:25:57,949 --> 01:26:01,786
In that dark, dank
fruit cellar? No!

771
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:05,248
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

772
01:26:05,331 --> 01:26:08,251
Now get out!

773
01:26:08,376 --> 01:26:12,130
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

774
01:26:12,213 --> 01:26:15,216
Norman, what do you
think you're doing?

775
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:18,928
Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!

776
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:27,228
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

777
01:26:32,567 --> 01:26:34,402
Wonderful sermon today.

778
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:36,905
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

779
01:26:36,988 --> 01:26:39,240
We thought we'd drive out
to that motel with you.

780
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:41,659
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.

781
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:44,412
- Did you two have breakfast?
- Didn't find anything?

782
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:48,166
Nothing. Let's
clear the way here.

783
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:50,543
What did he say
about my sister?

784
01:26:50,627 --> 01:26:53,838
Just what he told your detective:
She used a fake name.

785
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:58,218
Saw the register myself. Saw the
whole place. That boy's alone there.

786
01:26:58,259 --> 01:27:01,221
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

787
01:27:01,262 --> 01:27:03,723
I know you're not
the seein'-illusions type,

788
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:06,726
but no woman was there and I don't
believe in ghosts, so there it is.

789
01:27:06,726 --> 01:27:08,728
I still feel
there's something...

790
01:27:08,728 --> 01:27:12,315
Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't
make you feel better.

791
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,820
Come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft.

792
01:27:16,903 --> 01:27:19,739
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

793
01:27:19,823 --> 01:27:23,410
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister bein'picked up.

794
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:25,537
How 'bout that?

795
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:28,707
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

796
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:32,919
Come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.

797
01:27:33,003 --> 01:27:34,921
You too, Sam.

798
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:37,799
Thank you.

799
01:27:37,882 --> 01:27:42,804
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

800
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:46,141
- You want me to drop you at the hotel...
- Sam.

801
01:27:46,182 --> 01:27:50,895
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

802
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:54,190
Neither will I.
Come on.

803
01:27:54,274 --> 01:27:58,361
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

804
01:27:58,403 --> 01:28:00,655
We're going to register
as man and wife.

805
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:03,908
We're going to
get shown to a cabin,

806
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:07,620
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

807
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:33,855
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

808
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:35,857
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

809
01:28:35,899 --> 01:28:37,025
Come on.

810
01:28:40,236 --> 01:28:42,655
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

811
01:28:42,739 --> 01:28:44,657
Uh-huh.
Suppose you want a room.

812
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:47,202
We were gonna try to make it
to San Francisco,

813
01:28:47,285 --> 01:28:49,788
but we don't like the look
of that sky.

814
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:52,791
Looks like a bad day coming,
doesn't it?

815
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:02,092
- I'll take you to cabin ten.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

816
01:29:02,175 --> 01:29:04,094
That's not necessary.

817
01:29:04,177 --> 01:29:07,847
My boss is paying for this trip
and, uh, well, it's 90%business.

818
01:29:07,931 --> 01:29:10,725
He wants practically
notarized receipts.

819
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:13,728
I'd better sign in
and get a receipt.

820
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:33,581
Thank you.

821
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,794
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

822
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:44,342
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

823
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,344
You check in any other place
in this country without bags...

824
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:50,390
- And you have to pay in advance.
- Ten dollars.

825
01:29:57,063 --> 01:29:59,399
That receipt.

826
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:06,906
I'll go on ahead.

827
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:14,581
All right, there's your receipt.
I'll show you the cabin.

828
01:30:14,622 --> 01:30:17,459
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

829
01:30:35,935 --> 01:30:38,313
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

830
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:41,316
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

831
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:43,234
I know.

832
01:30:43,276 --> 01:30:45,195
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

833
01:30:45,236 --> 01:30:47,197
I don't know, but if you had...

834
01:30:47,238 --> 01:30:50,700
a useless business like this motel,
what would you need to get out?

835
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:54,287
To get a new business somewhere else?
Forty thousand dollars?

836
01:30:57,082 --> 01:30:59,167
How could we prove that...

837
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:02,003
If he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

838
01:31:02,128 --> 01:31:04,381
There must be some proof
that exists now,

839
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:07,676
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

840
01:31:07,717 --> 01:31:12,722
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

841
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:14,724
Or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel...

842
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:16,351
the same way about you.

843
01:31:16,476 --> 01:31:19,187
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

844
01:31:19,312 --> 01:31:21,731
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us,

845
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:23,233
unless he was stopped.

846
01:31:23,316 --> 01:31:27,153
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

847
01:31:29,406 --> 01:31:32,075
We'll start with cabin one.

848
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:37,038
If he sees us,
we're just taking the air.

849
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:10,947
Bates.

850
01:32:59,662 --> 01:33:01,623
No shower curtain.

851
01:33:01,706 --> 01:33:04,209
- Sam! Look!
- Huh? What is it?

852
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:06,419
It's figuring. It didn't
get washed down. Look.

853
01:33:06,503 --> 01:33:10,423
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

854
01:33:10,507 --> 01:33:12,967
That proves Marion was here.
It'd be too wild a coincidence...

855
01:33:13,051 --> 01:33:14,969
Bates never denied she was here.

856
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:18,223
Oh. Doesn't that prove
he found out about the money?

857
01:33:18,264 --> 01:33:20,892
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

858
01:33:20,975 --> 01:33:24,354
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

859
01:33:24,437 --> 01:33:27,732
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

860
01:33:27,816 --> 01:33:30,068
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

861
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:32,070
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

862
01:33:32,153 --> 01:33:35,323
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

863
01:33:35,365 --> 01:33:38,743
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

864
01:33:38,785 --> 01:33:41,705
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

865
01:33:41,746 --> 01:33:43,707
I can handle a sick old woman.

866
01:33:43,748 --> 01:33:46,668
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

867
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:49,713
Wait a minute.

868
01:33:49,754 --> 01:33:53,008
If you get anything
out of the mother,

869
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:55,301
can you find your way
back to town?

870
01:33:55,427 --> 01:33:57,721
Yes, of course.

871
01:33:57,804 --> 01:34:01,141
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

872
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:26,583
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter off act.

873
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:28,793
Wife's taking a nap and...

874
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:32,797
I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I thought I'd look you up and talk.

875
01:34:32,922 --> 01:34:36,259
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

876
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:52,335
I've been doing all the talking
so far, haven't I?

877
01:35:52,419 --> 01:35:54,796
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time...

878
01:35:54,879 --> 01:35:57,257
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

879
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,509
Here you are
doing all the listening.

880
01:35:59,592 --> 01:36:02,053
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

881
01:36:02,095 --> 01:36:04,723
Drive me crazy.

882
01:36:04,764 --> 01:36:07,726
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

883
01:36:07,767 --> 01:36:12,897
Just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do anything to get away.

884
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:14,941
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

885
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:22,240
Mrs. Bates?

886
01:37:39,067 --> 01:37:41,653
I'm not saying you
shouldn't be contented here,

887
01:37:41,736 --> 01:37:43,655
I'm just doubting that you are.

888
01:37:43,738 --> 01:37:47,325
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under you'd unload this place.

889
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:51,329
This place? This place happens
to be my only world.

890
01:37:51,413 --> 01:37:54,332
I grew up in that house.
I had a very happy childhood.

891
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:57,002
My mother and I
were more than happy.

892
01:38:58,772 --> 01:39:01,232
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

893
01:39:01,316 --> 01:39:03,234
I don't know
what you've been saying.

894
01:39:03,318 --> 01:39:06,446
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

895
01:39:06,529 --> 01:39:08,698
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

896
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:11,534
Buy a new one in a new town where you
won't have to hide your mother.

897
01:39:11,618 --> 01:39:14,496
Why don't you just get in
your car and drive away?

898
01:39:14,579 --> 01:39:18,416
Where will you get the money to do that?
Or do you already have it socked away?

899
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,753
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.

900
01:39:25,215 --> 01:39:28,677
I bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it.

901
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,472
I think she'll tell us.

902
01:39:32,597 --> 01:39:36,184
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

903
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:43,376
Mrs. Bates, it's...

904
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:06,900
Norman Bates!

905
01:41:35,178 --> 01:41:38,848
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

906
01:41:38,932 --> 01:41:41,685
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

907
01:41:41,726 --> 01:41:43,728
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

908
01:41:44,979 --> 01:41:47,691
Did he talk to you?

909
01:41:47,732 --> 01:41:50,652
No.

910
01:41:50,735 --> 01:41:55,740
I got the whole story, but not from
Norman. I got it from his "mother."

911
01:41:56,991 --> 01:42:00,620
Norman Bates
no longer exists.

912
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:03,415
He only half-existed
to begin with.

913
01:42:03,498 --> 01:42:07,585
And now the other half
has taken over,

914
01:42:07,627 --> 01:42:10,213
probably for all time.

915
01:42:11,965 --> 01:42:13,925
Did he kill my sister?

916
01:42:14,009 --> 01:42:17,512
Yes...and no.

917
01:42:17,637 --> 01:42:20,265
Now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork...

918
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:23,018
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop...

919
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:26,229
A psychiatrist
doesn't lay the groundwork.

920
01:42:26,312 --> 01:42:28,732
He merely tries
to explain it.

921
01:42:28,773 --> 01:42:31,776
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

922
01:42:34,154 --> 01:42:38,742
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

923
01:42:38,867 --> 01:42:42,704
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'Il...

924
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:49,544
Uh, have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books?

925
01:42:49,627 --> 01:42:52,797
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

926
01:42:52,839 --> 01:42:55,842
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said,

927
01:42:55,967 --> 01:42:57,886
the "mother."

928
01:42:59,721 --> 01:43:03,725
To understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the "mother"...

929
01:43:03,808 --> 01:43:07,395
that is from the "mother" half
of Norman's mind...

930
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:10,440
you have to go back
ten years...

931
01:43:10,523 --> 01:43:13,026
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

932
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:18,198
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been since his father died.

933
01:43:19,824 --> 01:43:24,454
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman,

934
01:43:24,537 --> 01:43:28,416
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

935
01:43:29,959 --> 01:43:32,462
Then she met a man,

936
01:43:32,545 --> 01:43:36,966
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

937
01:43:37,008 --> 01:43:40,470
That pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

938
01:43:40,553 --> 01:43:44,724
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

939
01:43:46,518 --> 01:43:50,438
most unbearable
to the son who commits it.

940
01:43:50,522 --> 01:43:55,860
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

941
01:43:58,279 --> 01:44:00,740
He stole her corpse.

942
01:44:02,617 --> 01:44:05,745
A weighted coffin was buried.

943
01:44:05,787 --> 01:44:08,707
He hid the body
in the fruit cellar,

944
01:44:08,748 --> 01:44:11,793
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

945
01:44:11,876 --> 01:44:14,713
And that still
wasn't enough.

946
01:44:14,754 --> 01:44:18,508
She was there...
but she was a corpse.

947
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:23,763
So he began to think
and speak for her,

948
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:26,891
give her half his life,
so to speak.

949
01:44:26,975 --> 01:44:31,646
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

950
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:36,026
At other times, the "mother" half
took over completely.

951
01:44:36,109 --> 01:44:40,739
He was never all Norman,
but he was of ten only "Mother,"

952
01:44:42,407 --> 01:44:45,994
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her,

953
01:44:46,077 --> 01:44:48,747
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him.

954
01:44:48,788 --> 01:44:54,085
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

955
01:44:54,169 --> 01:44:57,881
the "mother" side of him
would go wild.

956
01:45:00,216 --> 01:45:03,219
When he met your sister,

957
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:05,847
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

958
01:45:05,972 --> 01:45:08,725
He wanted her.

959
01:45:08,808 --> 01:45:12,729
That set off the jealous "mother"
and "Mother" killed the girl.

960
01:45:15,357 --> 01:45:19,652
After the murder Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep...

961
01:45:19,736 --> 01:45:23,448
and, like a dutiful son, covered up
all traces of the crime...

962
01:45:23,573 --> 01:45:25,950
he was convinced
his "mother" had committed!

963
01:45:25,992 --> 01:45:28,495
Why was he...
dressed like that?

964
01:45:28,578 --> 01:45:31,414
He's a transvestite.

965
01:45:31,498 --> 01:45:34,167
Uh, not exactly.

966
01:45:34,209 --> 01:45:37,754
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change,

967
01:45:37,837 --> 01:45:40,048
or satisfaction,
is a transvestite.

968
01:45:40,131 --> 01:45:44,469
But in Norman's case, he was simply
doing everything possible...

969
01:45:44,511 --> 01:45:47,722
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

970
01:45:49,099 --> 01:45:52,185
And when reality
came too close,

971
01:45:52,268 --> 01:45:55,855
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

972
01:45:58,233 --> 01:46:01,319
he dressed up, even to
a cheap wig he bought.

973
01:46:01,361 --> 01:46:05,365
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

974
01:46:05,407 --> 01:46:07,659
He tried to be
his mother.

975
01:46:09,202 --> 01:46:12,372
And, uh, now he is.

976
01:46:12,414 --> 01:46:17,419
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the "mother."

977
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:21,423
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities...

978
01:46:21,464 --> 01:46:25,010
there's always
a conflict, a battle.

979
01:46:25,051 --> 01:46:28,722
In Norman's case,
the battle is over...

980
01:46:28,805 --> 01:46:30,932
and the dominant personality
has won.

981
01:46:31,016 --> 01:46:35,145
And the $40,000?
Who got that?

982
01:46:35,228 --> 01:46:38,982
The swamp. These were
crimes of passion, not profit.

983
01:46:40,734 --> 01:46:43,445
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

984
01:46:44,738 --> 01:46:46,740
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

985
01:46:59,294 --> 01:47:01,713
Thank you.

986
01:47:08,345 --> 01:47:11,348
It's sad when a mother
has to speak the words...

987
01:47:11,431 --> 01:47:13,683
that condemn her own son,

988
01:47:13,725 --> 01:47:17,562
but I couldn't allow them
to believe that I would commit murder.

989
01:47:17,645 --> 01:47:22,025
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

990
01:47:22,108 --> 01:47:24,944
He was always bad,
and in the end...

991
01:47:25,028 --> 01:47:29,532
he intended to tell them I killed
those girls and that man,

992
01:47:29,574 --> 01:47:33,286
as if I could do anything
except sit and stare,

993
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:36,373
like one of his stuffed birds.

994
01:47:36,414 --> 01:47:39,959
They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

995
01:47:40,001 --> 01:47:45,632
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

996
01:47:48,718 --> 01:47:52,472
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

997
01:47:52,555 --> 01:47:56,309
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

998
01:47:56,434 --> 01:47:58,728
I'm not even
gonna swat that fly.

999
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:02,232
I hope they are watching.
They'll see.

1000
01:48:02,315 --> 01:48:04,234
They'll see
and they'll know,

1001
01:48:04,317 --> 01:48:09,948
and they'll say, "Why, shewouldn't even harm a fly."
