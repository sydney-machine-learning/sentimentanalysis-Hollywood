1
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,077
Well, there it is, darl. Bulinga.

2
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,754
Just another town.

3
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,718
Can't tell it from 20 others
we've passed through in six months.

4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,713
Best part is when you come to them
for the first time, like now.

5
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,199
They're all different somehow.

6
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,999
You mean like some have six pubs
and others have a dozen?

7
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,151
No, that ain't what I mean.

8
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,629
The trouble with you, Ida,
is you got no imagination.

9
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,995
I got an aching backside,
that's my trouble.

10
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,513
I know all about that backside.

11
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,750
It only aches
when you're losing an argument.

12
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,831
Let's go, Sam.

13
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,600
- Good night, Mum.
- Good night, dear.

14
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,836
Is that all the money we got left?

15
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,833
Yeah.

16
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,911
And keep your hands off it.

17
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,310
Got a hole in my sock.

18
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,909
All right.
Leave it out where I can find it.

19
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,192
Aren't you gonna wash tonight?

20
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,316
I washed this morning.

21
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,837
Admiring yourself?

22
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,638
Magnificent specimen, ain't I?

23
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,839
Oh, I don't know. Downright puny
compared to some I've seen.

24
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,312
You know something, Ide?

25
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,239
You're built the way
a woman ought to be built.

26
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,992
- Just find it out?
- No, I noticed it a couple times before.

27
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,152
It just came home to me today,
when we were passing through Cooma...

28
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,514
...seeing all them sheilas.

29
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,148
Broomsticks, that's what they are.
Nothing to hang on to.

30
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,514
Did you try?

31
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,918
Now, you know better than that.
I was just looking.

32
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,875
- And comparing, eh?
- That's right.

33
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,476
Looking, comparing,
thinking what a lucky bloke I am.

34
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,712
Oh, glad to know you appreciate me.

35
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,840
Come on over here, I'll appreciate you.

36
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,238
Want another cuppa?
There's still some in the billy.

37
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,833
No.

38
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,875
Sean, get that saddle on Sam, will you?

39
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,750
Well, come on, get a move on you.

40
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,832
Look at that farm, Dad. Ain't it a beaut?

41
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,952
It's nice.

42
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,712
Oh, it's all right.

43
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,950
Bit on the small side.

44
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,314
And how many acres do you own,
Mr. Carmody?

45
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,596
All of Australia, that's what I own.

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,274
The rivers, the plains, all of it.

47
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,956
Do you suppose the poor coot on that
farm can just come and go like we do?

48
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,192
- Well, maybe he don't want to.
- He can't. He's stuck.

49
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,430
He don't sleep
for fear his cows will run dry...

50
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,068
...or else he don't sleep
because he's up milking them.

51
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,152
Breaks his back painting the place
and watches the sun peel it off.

52
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,709
Worries about droughts,
and when the drought breaks...

53
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,997
- ... he's got floods to worry about.
- You do have troubles, don't you?

54
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,833
Why, you've just gone through more
in the last 10 seconds...

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,911
...than most farmers go through
in 10 years.

56
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,038
Do you think those cow cockies
have an easy time of it?

57
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,509
Nobody has an easy time of it.

58
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,636
How do you know
that bloke don't lie awake...

59
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,756
...worrying about the mortgage?
Do I do that?

60
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,957
Well, if you did, you'd be the first man
ever mortgaged a tent.

61
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,953
Oh, you're a card, Ide.

62
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,429
You're a real card.

63
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,789
I don't know why the pictures
didn't take you instead of Buster Keaton.

64
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,960
Well, I'll be home for dinner.

65
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,269
Darl, if you get the job...

66
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,396
...what you gonna do
about an extra horse?

67
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,596
Well, I thought about
taking on another drover.

68
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,671
Be sure and get someone
we can live with.

69
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,195
We're gonna be stuck with him
for two or three months.

70
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,590
A clean-living teetotaler,
that's what I'll hire.

71
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,548
Well, you can try a little teetotaling
yourself, while you're at it.

72
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,871
It's all right, ain't it?

73
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,590
It's what home looks like,
when you have a home.

74
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,829
Reckon I'll go bag us
a couple of rabbits.

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,468
Head towards town.
See if you can find your dad.

76
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,676
He ought to have been back long ago.

77
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,628
He's either celebrating getting the job
or drowning his disappointment.

78
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,908
Come on, Ollie.

79
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,152
Get off me!

80
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,637
Get lost!

81
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,629
Ollie! Ollie, let go!
Hey, mister, that's my dog.

82
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,392
Get off!

83
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,474
Get this moronic whelp off me
before I beat his brains out.

84
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,995
Don't hit him.
Hit him with that, and I'll shoot you.

85
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,557
- Get off.
- Ollie, let go.

86
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,630
All right, fearless,
lower your blunderbuss.

87
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,997
Well, I don't know
if you've got a father...

88
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,517
...but you're obviously a piece
of true-blue British stock.

89
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,639
- My father's Irish.
- Oh, is he? I'm sorry.

90
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,394
I'm sorry about the dog.
He just don't seem to like people.

91
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,709
I am not people, boy.

92
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,836
You must teach him
to be more discriminating.

93
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,433
This your place?

94
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,397
Never mind that.
Where'd you spring from?

95
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,554
My old man's a drover.
We're here after a job moving sheep.

96
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,359
I mean, my dad's after it.
But where he goes, we all go.

97
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,953
Mr. Venneker!

98
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,954
- Yes.
- I want to talk to you, Mr. Venneker.

99
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,350
Indeed. Yes. The widow McDonald.

100
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,999
- Is she your boss?
- My employer...

101
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,469
- ... which is a vastly different thing.
- Mr. Venneker?

102
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,915
- Yes.
- You'll be back for dinner tonight...

103
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,036
- ... won't you?
- Well, I'll try. I can't-

104
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,634
I'm doing roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding for you.

105
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,633
Are you, indeed? Oh, there you are, yes.

106
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,831
Many's the man who sunk to his doom
in Yorkshire pudding.

107
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,516
- Pardon?
- Pay a woman a compliment...

108
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,513
...she tries to turn it into a contract.

109
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,792
Well, may I offer you a lift into town?

110
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,678
Yes, please.

111
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,877
Well, I must say, I find you less repellant
than most people your age.

112
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,792
Giddap, giddap.

113
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,797
- Well, there we are.
- He must've got the job.

114
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,998
Thank you, boy.

115
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,112
Thanks, Mr. Venneker.

116
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,438
Hey, Sean. Hey, that's my boy.

117
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,238
Hi, boy.

118
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,198
Right-o, Dad. How about you and me
going home now?

119
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,197
Don't wanna spoil the concert, do you?
What's the rush, anyway? I got the job.

120
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,079
Good-o. Did you hire a drover?

121
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,710
You were gonna get a bloke
with horses, remember?

122
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,791
You worry too much, Sean.

123
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,952
It's a sad thing, kid like you worrying.
I'll tell you what.

124
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,510
You run along home and leave everything
in your old man's hands, all right?

125
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,433
How about more from Paddy?

126
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,072
Now, look here. I simply cannot
concentrate on any drinking...

127
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,629
...with this intolerable noise going on.

128
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,632
Stop it!

129
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,475
Hello, boy. What's the matter?
You lost your father?

130
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,313
My old man's got the job,
and he's feeling too good to quit.

131
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,518
- That's him singing.
- Is it? I'm very sorry to hear that.

132
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,750
He has the most disagreeable voice,
doesn't he?

133
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,150
- Well, he likes it.
- Does he?

134
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,435
Now, what's he weigh?

135
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,437
- Thirteen and a half.
- Thirteen and a half?

136
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,919
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen?

137
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,354
Why?

138
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,797
I wouldn't disturb him
while he's singing.

139
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,871
Hold my beer, will you?

140
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,109
Oh, no. Not again. Boy!

141
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,437
Ollie, let go.

142
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,038
Get off. Get off!

143
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,232
Come on, hurry up.

144
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,754
Boy, get this man-eating mongrel
off me.

145
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,718
Get off. Get off.

146
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,109
Get off. Get off.

147
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,113
Hey, you know that English coot?
The remittance man.

148
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,350
The one whose old man's
a lord or something.

149
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,112
He's having a blue with some fella.

150
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,669
Good on him.
Can you see anyone with our beer?

151
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,439
Get off!

152
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,192
Get off.

153
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,473
Ollie, will you quit it?

154
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,268
Let the law through.

155
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,278
It's old Venneker. He's drunk.

156
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,317
No, he's not.
He's being attacked by a dog.

157
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,516
- A mad dog?
- Mad dog?

158
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,477
- Mad dog.
- Mad dog.

159
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,198
- Mad dog?
- Mad dog.

160
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,435
Look out, he leaning.

161
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,030
I was bitten by a mad dog once.
Oh, God, I was crook.

162
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,634
They wouldn't let me have any beer
for a whole month.

163
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,393
Paddy.

164
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,832
Paddy!

165
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,880
When are we supposed to
pick up the sheep?

166
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,711
What's the flaming rush, Ide?
Since when do we-?

167
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,000
Conscientious bloke,
that drover you hired last night.

168
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,077
Got here before sunup.

169
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,718
So there you are, Carmody.

170
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,110
Hale and chipper for the job ahead?

171
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,995
Ain't it cracker,
Mr. Venneker coming with us, Dad?

172
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,513
Sean, you got the wagon packed?

173
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,274
- I'm gonna put Mr. Venneker's stuff in.
- Hang on.

174
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,192
Look, mate...

175
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,871
...I was a bit shickered last night.

176
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,396
You looked like something sculptured
from the sediment of a beer vat.

177
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,471
Never mind about that.

178
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,391
The point is, I don't need a drover.

179
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,357
Well, where'd you get that idea?

180
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,511
You make less sense sober
than drunk, Carmody.

181
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,831
- You got 1200 head of sheep to move.
- I've moved bigger mobs on my own.

182
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,149
You're not on your own.

183
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,915
If you insist on riding that dejected beast
of yours, who's gonna pull the wagon?

184
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,196
- The good woman there?
- I shouldn't be surprised.

185
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,554
Right-o.

186
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,678
Look, what's the sense talking?
I couldn't pay you anyway.

187
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,990
Oh, well, money is not my problem.

188
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,799
You can pay me
when we get to Cawndilla.

189
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,349
Ide, what the devil's
he gotta come with us for?

190
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,391
You hired me.

191
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,434
In any case,
I've been here long enough.

192
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,877
Most places are fit only
for arrivals and departures.

193
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,951
I like to do them both
as often as possible.

194
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,193
- Could be you talking.
- I knew we'd end up soul mates.

195
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,237
- I'm thinking of chucking up the job.
- No, you're not.

196
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,709
- Ide, you stay out of this.
- Speak for yourself.

197
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,074
Do you mind if I handle it?

198
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,470
If we have to live in a tent,
I say we keep moving.

199
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,393
That way, we've got an excuse
for not having a home.

200
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,152
I'm sick of other people's sympathy.

201
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,312
And that's what we always get
if we stay too long near any one town.

202
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,835
We're taking those sheep to Cawndilla,
no matter what.

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,833
And Mr. Venneker and his horses
are going with us.

204
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,632
I'm sorry, Carmody.
I didn't mean to precipitate that.

205
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,030
- Right-o, we'll take you.
- Yes.

206
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,350
And your horses.

207
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,152
That's 1200 sheep. Deliver them
to Cawndilla in six weeks...

208
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,993
...the bloke at the other end
will pay you a shilling a head.

209
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,593
- Goodbye. Good luck.
- Thank you.

210
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,311
Do me a favor, will you?

211
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,750
If you're gonna be a drover,
look like a drover.

212
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,512
Get rid of that silly, flaming hat.

213
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,274
Let me tell you about this silly,
flaming hat, my good man.

214
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,715
And don't call me that.
I'm not your good man.

215
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,549
- What do you prefer? Boss?
- Wouldn't be a bad idea.

216
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,359
This cap belonged to a ship's master
in the China trade.

217
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,556
Oh, what happened to him?

218
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,508
Nothing happened to him. He's just
not gonna call you boss, that's all.

219
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,069
Got a passenger for you. Here.

220
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,435
Good. Thanks, Dad.

221
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,029
Rupe, why do you talk to your horses?

222
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,397
Don't you know it's very rude
to listen to other people's conversations?

223
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,709
Sorry.

224
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,836
I never thought of horses as people.

225
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,672
Let's hope you never have to.

226
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,876
Are you a real duke?

227
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,994
Shut up, boy.

228
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,355
Dad told me you'd been
a ship's captain in China.

229
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,432
Oh, yes. I had occasion to tell him that.

230
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,874
What's China like?

231
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,716
Very full.

232
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,713
Just as Australia's very empty.

233
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,074
Why did you leave?

234
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,117
My stomach.
I was a notoriously bad sailor.

235
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,990
Dad said you must've been a better
sailor than you are a horseman.

236
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,470
What the devil's he talking about?
I was cashiered from the 17th Lancers...

237
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,915
...before he knew one end of a horse
from the other.

238
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,991
Not that he does now.

239
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,148
What does "cashiered" mean?

240
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,797
A kind of promotion,
from the army into civilian life.

241
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,315
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

242
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,598
Go to sleep now.

243
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,516
- I'd love to go to China.
- What about the farm?

244
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,557
I want that more than anything.

245
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,597
Want a bit of everything, like me.

246
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,320
- Because you're young.
- But you're not, though.

247
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,392
I'm younger than I seem to you.

248
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,312
I've never really grown up, you see.
And you've never had time.

249
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,871
That's why we're out here instead of
in a comfortable tent, like your parents.

250
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,032
- Rupe...
- No more questions.

251
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,317
You're still growing upwards.
I'm only growing sideways now.

252
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,994
Apart from that,
we have a great deal in common.

253
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,635
Come on, Sam. Giddap, there.
Come on, giddap.

254
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,597
Hey, Dad, look, a dingo.

255
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,951
- Where?
- Over there, Mum.

256
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,674
Just like a dingo.

257
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,274
Too big a coward to come out
in the open and have a go.

258
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,353
He'll catch a couple of sheep tonight
and kill them just for the fun of it.

259
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,109
Not if I get him first, he won't.

260
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,838
Get him, Dad!

261
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,154
Missed him.

262
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,390
Nice bit of riding, all the same.

263
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,551
Come on, giddap, Sam.

264
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,074
- Good day.
- Good day.

265
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,997
- Be all right to spill the mob here?
- You can use that paddock there.

266
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,630
But don't let them stray into the
other one. Me grass is thin enough now.

267
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,075
Yeah, looks a bit dry.
You been having a rough trot?

268
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,390
Terrible. No rain now for 10 months.

269
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,993
- Good day.
- Good day.

270
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,354
- We're the Batemans.
- Hello.

271
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,829
- We're the Carmodys.
- How you doing?

272
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,271
- This here's-
- Rupert Venneker. Afternoon, ladies.

273
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,598
English.

274
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,956
I ain't had a man
take off his hat off to me...

275
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,156
...since the day Ern first met me.

276
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,995
Oh, thank you very much.
If you'll excuse me... Sheep.

277
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,113
Why don't you came in for a cuppa?

278
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,316
It'd be welcomed,
but I ought to start dinner.

279
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,436
How'd you like to cook it
on a regular stove?

280
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,433
- How did you know?
- Ern used to be a drover.

281
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,479
I broke my back
bending over too many campfires.

282
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,558
My name's Kylie.

283
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,438
Come on.

284
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,832
Here we are.

285
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,560
Ida, the way you cook,
I'll never hear the last of this.

286
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,438
Yeah, she'll do me, Paddy.
I'm thinking about keeping her.

287
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,673
Oh, I'm a champion woodchopper too.
I get plenty of practice.

288
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,679
Ern, how long you been here?

289
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,876
Started eight years ago
with only the land.

290
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,237
- Things was pretty crook for a while.
- You should've stuck with droving.

291
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,356
No worries
a horse can't take you away from.

292
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,837
- Stay put, that's my motto.
- Well, it's different with us.

293
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,788
- Ida likes to move about, don't you?
- Oh, you'll hear if I don't.

294
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,758
Of course, it might be different
when the girls marry.

295
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,112
Mum, can I take my scraps down
to Ollie?

296
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,078
- Oh, yes, dear.
- Excuse me, missus.

297
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,394
I've got plenty of scraps for Ollie too.

298
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,233
Well, all right.

299
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,875
His mother got me the same way.

300
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,352
Darl.

301
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,634
After Cawndilla, where are we going?

302
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,238
Oh, I don't know.

303
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,036
What difference does it make?

304
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,630
What's the matter, darl?
Can't you sleep?

305
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,109
I was thinking about Sean.

306
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,992
He really wants us to settle down,
get a place of our own.

307
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,393
You saw the way
he looked around here today.

308
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,673
It's like that with every farm we pass.

309
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,798
He's never stopped talking
about the one in Bulinga.

310
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,873
Ide, he wouldn't wanna be
a blooming farmer, would he?

311
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,359
Oh, he might.

312
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,637
It's natural for him to want a home.
He's not all you, remember?

313
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,349
No, but he thinks like me. Anyway,
he's not old enough to leave school yet.

314
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,794
What school?

315
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,190
He's been going to school
and I didn't know it?

316
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,918
He went to school in Jindabyne.

317
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,719
And that six weeks at Broken Hill.
What about the time-?

318
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,030
Oh, imagine all that schooling.

319
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,556
- He must be ready for the university.
- He can read and write, can't he?

320
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,234
He wouldn't be able to do that
if I hadn't taught him.

321
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,313
Ide, you're getting me all mixed up.
Now, where was I?

322
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,074
Sean was getting ready to leave school.

323
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,595
We'll have to get him
a new suit for that occasion.

324
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,830
Well, if you're just
gonna be funny about it...

325
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,639
Oh, no, no, no. Go on. You're the boss.

326
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,079
Right.

327
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,194
Well, I was gonna say,
all this talk about settling down...

328
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,078
...he could forget about that tomorrow.

329
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,992
You know how kids are.

330
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,517
You mean, because he feels
so comfortable...

331
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,433
...bouncing his guts out in the wagon,
sleeping on the ground...

332
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,797
...and eating dust with his food and
never getting to know anyone but us?

333
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,317
No, I mean because he's a kid, and kids
change their mind every 10 minutes.

334
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,314
Six months from now, he might
even wanna be a tram conductor.

335
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,438
And what if six months from now,
he still wants a place?

336
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,034
Well, that's when
we'll talk about it, then.

337
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,870
Right now, we better try
and get some sleep.

338
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,828
Anyway, we ain't got enough money
for a fence post, let alone a farm.

339
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,080
How much will we have in six months?

340
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,991
I thought I smelled smoke.

341
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,311
Well, my nose is too full of dust
to smell anything.

342
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,516
There's a fire on that ridge over there.

343
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,796
Well, that ridge is over two miles away.

344
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,996
Two miles ain't anything
if it's a crown fire.

345
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,754
It can go through the treetops
faster than a horse can run.

346
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,959
Everything underneath it, trees, scrub,
air, the lot, just goes up in flames.

347
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,315
- I see.
- Better get the mob on the run.

348
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,037
Fire. You better get a move on, quick.

349
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,517
Oh, it's coming this way.

350
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,877
There's a river two miles on.
Get to the other side, you'll be all right.

351
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,792
You hop down, Sean. We'll need you.

352
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,636
Don't go risking your life
for the sheep, now.

353
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,836
- See you the other side of the river.
- Come on.

354
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,995
It's a crown fire.
Get up to the head of the mob.

355
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,037
You can make a break for it
if you have to.

356
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,997
Tell Sean to get after Ida.

357
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,870
Get back to your mother, Sean.
Your dad says so.

358
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,315
- But what about-?
- Go on. Cut through there.

359
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,550
Move, boy, move. Go on.

360
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,035
Mum.

361
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,955
Mum! Mum!

362
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,513
- Dad told me to come ahead.
- But what about him and Mr. Venneker?

363
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,716
They'll be all right.
He knows what he's doing.

364
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,711
I hope so.
Come on, Sam, giddap!

365
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,074
Giddap!

366
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,076
Hey, the mob's breaking up.

367
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,912
I've got to turn them back.

368
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,108
Paddy, come back!

369
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,392
Paddy!

370
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,919
Paddy!

371
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,519
Paddy!

372
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,393
Paddy!

373
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,913
Paddy!

374
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,637
Whoa, back, Sam! Whoa, back!

375
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,472
Whoa, back. Whoa, back!

376
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,151
It's swinging away from us.
We're all right.

377
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,436
We're not all right.
Your dad's still in there.

378
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,153
Where's Paddy? Where's Paddy?

379
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,352
Mum! Mum!

380
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,759
Paddy.

381
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,590
Oh, Paddy.

382
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,673
Well, here it is, Ide.

383
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,438
What is it, darl?

384
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,317
Nothing, really.

385
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,512
Giddap, Sam.

386
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,550
Lord love a duck, a woman.
Been waiting long?

387
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,438
I've been having a bash at the piano.

388
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,160
You should've come sooner,
you would've heard me singing.

389
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,312
I've got a voice like a foghorn,
but I enjoy myself.

390
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,916
I don't think life's worth living
unless you enjoy yourself, eh?

391
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,038
Now, where are you from? You look
as though you've come a long way.

392
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,112
What are your names?
Oh, never mind, we can sign that later.

393
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,236
- How long you gonna be here?
- Just the night.

394
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,231
We're off to Queensland in the morning.

395
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,830
We come over from Bulinga.
Our name's Carmody.

396
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,991
Oh, Bulinga? I don't know where that is.

397
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,469
My word, you are lucky,
all this traveling.

398
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,110
I've always wanted to travel.
I came from Port Augusta for a week...

399
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,635
...about 15 years ago,
and I've never been back since.

400
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,518
Have they missed you?

401
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,033
Ain't he a joker? With a beard too.
I bet that scratches the girls, eh, love?

402
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,078
- Now then, what can I do to help?
- Well, we'd like a bath.

403
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,356
T oo right, too right. Plenty of hot water.

404
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,671
Now, who's going first?
Or is it all in together, this cold weather?

405
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,070
Now, follow me.
Nothing like a good hot bath.

406
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,037
Weakens the men
and strengthens the women.

407
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,679
Ought to be the other way around.

408
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,513
Now, come on, Mrs. Carmody.
I'll take you and sonny first.

409
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,035
I'll get the baggage, all right, Mum?

410
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,557
Carmody, do you think that creature
is planning to give us our baths?

411
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,518
I've got Ida to protect me.
But I'd watch my step if I was you.

412
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,989
Especially if you're gonna stick around
for a while.

413
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,435
Oh, yes. This is the end of the line,
isn't it?

414
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,556
Hey, that's right.
This is where we split up.

415
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,119
Rupe, aren't you moving with us?

416
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,114
No. I only signed on to come this far,
Sean. Job's finished.

417
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,879
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

418
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,511
- Come on, Carmody. I'll buy you a drink.
- No, let me buy you a drink.

419
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,910
You know, Rupe, sometimes
you make my teeth ache...

420
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,672
...but there's worse than you.

421
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,229
Now that we're parting, Carmody,
the drinks are on me.

422
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,550
Look, don't start another
flaming argument on me.

423
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,790
It's my show!

424
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,958
Look, Mum.

425
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,720
Shearers coming from all over Australia
to make money...

426
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,440
...and here we are,
turning our backs on it.

427
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,629
If we stay here, maybe I could get a job.

428
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,711
You're old enough to be a tar-boy.

429
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,711
If you and your dad
both work as a team...

430
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,838
...we could make quite a little
nest egg to put in the jam jar.

431
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,719
Just in case we ever decided to settle.

432
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,190
Settle? You mean, get a place?

433
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,436
Our own place?

434
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,794
But what about Dad?

435
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,236
He said that if in six months,
you still wanted it, we'd talk about it...

436
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,675
- ... and that was quite a while back.
- Did he mean it?

437
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,276
No. But he'll have to talk about it
if we've got the money and still want it.

438
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,319
- I do want it.
- Then that just leaves getting the money.

439
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,316
Well done, if I say so,
who sings it better alone.

440
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,438
There's nothing like a sing-song
to get the dust out of your lungs.

441
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,238
- How you going? All right?
- Very well.

442
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,470
How about a dance? Ida, can you play?

443
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,195
Oh, I haven't played for years.
I suppose I can try.

444
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,032
Good-o.

445
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,319
No, no, no.

446
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,391
No prancing. No, no.

447
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,312
Oh, that's more exhausting than track.

448
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,675
Rupe, we'd like you to come
to Queensland with us.

449
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,319
Now, what do you say?

450
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,994
I say, you'll hate yourself in the morning.

451
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,957
But I think I'll linger a while...

452
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,999
...and investigate the possibilities
of Cawndilla.

453
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,118
Paddy, do you think he means me?

454
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,316
I've never had such a good time.

455
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,074
I say, Ida,
why don't you stay here a while?

456
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,913
No, no, no. One night will do us.

457
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,594
We're the restless type, ain't we, Ide?

458
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,478
Looks that way, doesn't it?

459
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,749
Where are you going, Sean?

460
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,718
- I don't know. To bed, I suppose.
- No one can blame you.

461
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,111
Nothing's so revolting to the young
as the sight of their elders at play.

462
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,670
You get a good night's rest, Sean.
Gotta get an early start in the morning.

463
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,513
- Good night, son.
- Good night, Mum.

464
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,516
But think what we could do
with the money.

465
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,593
We could fix up the wagon,
get new gear, buy an extra horse.

466
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,159
You think Sam isn't tired?

467
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,675
You think poor old Sam
doesn't need a bit of a rest?

468
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,355
First it's Sean, then it's you,
and now it's Sam I gotta do all this for.

469
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,671
What about Ollie? Is he mad for me
to be shearing sheep too?

470
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,637
Mr. Venneker's coming with us after all.

471
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,438
That's nice. What are you doing here?

472
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,592
I didn't investigate the possibilities
of Cawndilla, after all.

473
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,116
Things got very serious
after you left the party and...

474
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,674
I'm an old fish, Carmody.

475
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,513
- I know the hook when I see it.
- You ain't going back to her?

476
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,399
I probably will, eventually.
She's an awfully pleasant person.

477
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,597
I flatter myself I created
a rather good impression on her.

478
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,716
Pity to waste it.

479
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,235
Shall we join the shearers?

480
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,909
Good day. You the shearing boss?

481
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,911
Yeah. Quinlan's the name.

482
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,114
Looks like you got your team
all filled up already, eh?

483
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,429
Pretty near.

484
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,034
- How good are you?
- Just fair. I ain't done it a while.

485
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,875
He doesn't like to boast, but he can
do better than 200 sheep a day.

486
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,429
- His best is 248.
- Yeah.

487
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,313
Mister, you got yourself a job.

488
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,471
Hold on there. Not so fast.

489
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,438
We're sticking together. It's all or none.

490
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,478
My kid wants to be a tar-boy.

491
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,870
Well, that's easy enough.

492
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,512
What about him? He don't look like
shearing no sheep, does he?

493
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,874
He's quite right, actually.

494
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,589
If I have to break my back, I'd rather
do it by some more merciful method.

495
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,116
I reckon that puts the kibosh on it.
No point in wasting Mr. Quinlan's time.

496
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,032
Now, look, just a minute.

497
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,351
We've still got an opening
for a cook and a wool roller.

498
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,999
How do either of them strike you?

499
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,957
The roller's job is gone
to Mr. Venneker.

500
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,111
That leaves me.
How about me for the cook?

501
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,840
Just a minute, darl.
You never cooked for a-

502
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,389
That queers it.
I never use a woman cook.

503
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,472
Right-o, if the missus ain't
good enough for you, neither am I.

504
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,868
Come on, love.

505
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,712
Hold your horses.

506
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,795
As union representative of this team,
I gotta remind you of the rules.

507
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,110
It's the men who choose the cook,
not the boss.

508
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,474
Bluey, use your head, man.

509
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,950
They've gotta have a cook they can
abuse if the tucker's not up to scratch.

510
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,111
That tucker will be up to scratch,
all right.

511
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,475
If that's them, why don't you ask them?

512
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,078
All right. Hey, you blokes,
come on over here, will you?

513
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,639
Come on, move it.

514
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,832
There's a lady here
looking for a job as cook.

515
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,958
Now, it's up to you blokes,
like the union rep says.

516
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,510
As far as I'm concerned, the vote's no.
A wool shed's no place for a woman.

517
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,955
I won't be in the wool shed,
I'll be in the kitchen.

518
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,634
Been a long time since I had a meal
cooked by a woman.

519
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,519
- Be a nice change.
- I'm not worried about the food, missus.

520
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,069
But there's rough language
that goes on in the shed.

521
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,151
Some might shock you,
you know what I mean?

522
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,154
- You wouldn't be able to stand it, love.
- I've stood your language for 16 years.

523
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,470
If she can cook as good as my missus,
I'm for her.

524
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,198
I'm for giving the lady a chance.

525
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,558
Well, yeah. Let's try her out.
All we can get is indigestion.

526
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,916
Sean!

527
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,918
That boy of mine
is real keen to get started.

528
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,593
He'll do.

529
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,035
It's that husband of yours
who don't seem too keen.

530
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,510
You haven't got a worry.
He's as happy as a lark.

531
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,072
What the-?

532
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,835
All New South bloody Wales to drive in,
and you gotta aim at us!

533
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,513
Didn't you hear me blow me horn?

534
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,716
What's blowing your horn
got to do with it?

535
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,836
- We had the right of way!
- Right of way? Go-

536
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,639
Right-o. You're in the wrong,
and that's all there is to it.

537
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,109
- Come on. Shake a leg.
- You wanna pull your head in.

538
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,033
- Herbie was in the right.
- Who asked you to put your oar in-?

539
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,319
Like to make a small wager
on who's gonna get-?

540
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,990
Hey! Get back!

541
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,277
Right-o, everybody. All aboard.

542
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,839
The war's over.

543
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,593
- Get up.
- All aboard!

544
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,510
Well, I must've drew Jack Dempsey.

545
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,399
I was going up and down
like a lavatory seat.

546
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,155
Ocker, it was you
what got us into that donnybrook.

547
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,790
- Good on him. Had the time of me life.
- Looked like you done some pro fighting.

548
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,235
I was up for the middleweight title
back in '01.

549
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,597
Got put in me back in the ninth.
Too much unwatered beer.

550
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,275
- I remember you. You're Turk Tuthill.
- I was all right.

551
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,237
Just wasn't good enough to be champ.

552
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,198
I'd say Paddy's missus
was champ today.

553
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,477
I never seen anyone
break up a fight so quick.

554
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,155
You got a real good sort there, Paddy.

555
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,719
Yeah.

556
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,759
Anyone know how to spell
"obstetrician"?

557
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,798
I'll tell you how if you tell us why.

558
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,593
Because I'm gonna have a baby.

559
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,069
- Did you hear that?
- Good on you, boy.

560
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,674
- Why, you little beauty.
- You'll do me for a dadda.

561
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,637
What do you want, Bluey,
a boy or a girl?

562
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,678
Make it a girl. They never have to work
as hard as us poor mugs.

563
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,239
Why don't you stop laughing?

564
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,834
If it is a boy, you gonna bring him up
to be a shearer?

565
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,390
Oh, no, no.
No, he's gonna be a cricketer.

566
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,516
The best bat since Victor Trumper.

567
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,399
He's gonna play for Australia
like I wanted to but never did.

568
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,836
Neither will he, because he's gonna
be a she. I'm never wrong.

569
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,468
Ocker, why don't you shut
your big, sour trap?

570
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,993
I hope he's good enough, Bluey.

571
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,469
Oh, he'll be good enough,
I'll see to that.

572
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,313
All he's gotta do is be born a boy.

573
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,191
- What's amusing you?
- Gee, it's gonna be fun.

574
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,510
This is the first time
I was ever away from home.

575
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,114
With your mom and dad
not 50 yards outside that window.

576
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,793
You call that being away from home?

577
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,633
Being out in the world's
a state of mind, not of geography.

578
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,870
Distance between that tent
and this bunkhouse...

579
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,157
...is the longest journey
you'll ever make in your life.

580
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,920
Anybody hollers for a bucket of dip,
you bring it, see?

581
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,548
You can't go wrong,
short of getting counted for a sheep.

582
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,358
Here comes the brains.

583
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,796
All right, men!

584
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,076
Hold on. Want him to think
you hear him?

585
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,071
You gotta keep the bosses
in their places.

586
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,232
This is the boss, Mr. Halstead.

587
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,199
Good day, men.

588
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,710
I want you to work fast,
but careful, right?

589
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,479
All right.

590
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,596
Get ready, now.

591
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,828
Who is it?

592
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,719
Good morning. I'm Jean Halstead.

593
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,758
Oh, the boss's wife. Come in.

594
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,558
I'm Ida Carmody.

595
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,280
I thought I'd drop in
and see if there's anything you need.

596
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,953
As a matter of fact, there is.

597
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,395
Would the boss go for me
getting a little oilcloth...

598
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,073
...to edge the shelves and windows?

599
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,593
I don't see why not.

600
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,149
Sorry it's such a dreary place
for you to work in.

601
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,551
It's the first kitchen I've been able
to call my own since I left home...

602
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,190
...and that's a long time ago.
To me, it's heaven.

603
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,831
Well, come on, sit down,
have a cuppa with me.

604
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,718
I just made a fresh pot.

605
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,317
I'll bet you didn't get that dress
in Cawndilla.

606
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,149
You remind me of a society girl who
gets their picture in the Sydney papers.

607
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,835
I used to be one before I got married.
Thought I'd changed by now.

608
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,118
Oh, aged? Not so as it shows.
You don't even look married.

609
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,714
I don't feel it most of the time.

610
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,516
Oh, living way out here
must be a big change...

611
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,954
...from what you're used to.

612
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,997
How do you like it?

613
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,959
I'm trying to.

614
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,151
Bob loves the place so...

615
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,472
...and he worries about
my not belonging.

616
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,310
The real trouble is, I've nothing to do.

617
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,238
Sorry.

618
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,359
I don't usually spill over like that.

619
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,474
Don't be silly.

620
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,155
You get starved for another woman
to talk to sometimes. I know.

621
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,039
This is a good country for sheep,
and it's not bad for men...

622
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,077
...but it's hard on us women.

623
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,879
The men come here for the sheep.
We come here for the men...

624
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,270
...and most of us finish up
looking like the sheep.

625
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,228
Wrinkled faces, knotty hair,
not even much of a mind of our own.

626
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,551
I think you'd always have a mind
of your own, Mrs. Carmody.

627
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,793
You sure you have time for a chat
with all those men to cook for?

628
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,873
It's their aching backs they'll be worrying
about tonight, not their stomachs.

629
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,713
First day's hard on them,
but it's a blessing for the cook.

630
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,995
Well, I hope you're satisfied,
you and Sean.

631
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,912
And Sam. Mustn't forget about Sam.

632
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,469
Shut up. You're worse than Ocker.

633
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,234
Why don't you give yourself
a chance to like it?

634
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,233
I don't see how you can like it,
cooking for a mob of no-hopers.

635
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,311
Working your fingers to the bone.

636
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,675
I'm having a real good time.

637
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,990
I got room to put things
and a chair to sit on...

638
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,628
...and another woman around
if I want a bit of a gossip.

639
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,190
She's a nice little piece,
not too happy either.

640
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,635
That Halstead probably gives her
a rough time of it.

641
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,598
No, just the opposite.
Keeps her wrapped in cotton wool.

642
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,069
Women don't like that, you know.

643
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,431
Educate me, darl.

644
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,397
Tell me what women do like.

645
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,118
All right.

646
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,037
No, no, no. Around here,
we do everything by the bell.

647
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,192
Get up by the bell, go to sleep
by the bell, eat by the bell...

648
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,237
...wash by the bell.

649
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,358
We ain't got a bell for that, Ide.

650
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,353
Oh, what's the use?

651
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,915
Welcome back, Rupe.
What would you like?

652
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,917
I'd like a schooner of beer,
among other things.

653
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,715
Ida, we have a visitor.

654
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,036
Oh, just a wild guess...

655
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,430
...but would you be Liz Brown,
Bluey's wife?

656
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,830
She's been traveling
three days and nights.

657
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,194
You took an awful risk.

658
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,194
- Might've had the baby on the train.
- I don't care. I want to be with Bluey.

659
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,794
And I don't care how angry he is either.

660
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,959
Oh, come on in and sit down.
You're all tired out.

661
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,953
- Sean, hurry up and get Liz a cuppa.
- All right.

662
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,949
There. Give me these, that's it.

663
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,637
I know the men
aren't supposed to bring their wives.

664
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,917
- Do you think they'll let me stay?
- Well, I don't know.

665
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,389
It's up to the boss, really.
What do you think, Jean?

666
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,994
Well, I don't see why she shouldn't.

667
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,029
There's lots of room up at the house.
And after all, it's my house too.

668
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,351
You wait here, Liz, and don't worry.

669
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,950
You powder your nose
after you've had your cuppa.

670
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,633
I'm gonna go and get your old man.

671
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,031
Sean here will keep you company.
He's a special friend of Bluey's.

672
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,559
Thank you.

673
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,799
I must look awful.

674
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,800
No, no, honest. You look good.

675
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,155
I mean, no worse
than a sheep does before-

676
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,475
You're not gonna have the baby now,
are you?

677
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,478
No.

678
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,353
I wouldn't dream of doing such a thing
to a special friend of Bluey's.

679
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,911
Liz! Liz! Liz!

680
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,437
Liz.

681
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,639
There's one doctor in Cawndilla.

682
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,155
He covers 500 miles,
so he's never there.

683
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,276
I just hope you women
know what you're doing.

684
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,590
We ought to,
we've been having babies long enough.

685
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,910
Tar-boy missing. Shearer missing.

686
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,514
All the men carrying on
like a bunch of school kids.

687
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,432
What sort of way is this to run a shed?

688
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,352
- Oh, shut up!
- Oh, shut up!

689
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,633
- Morning, Mum.
- Morning, dear.

690
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,394
There's a letter for you
from the Batemans.

691
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,991
- Bluey.
- Thanks.

692
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,429
Hey, listen to this, fellas.
It's from a mate of mine in Melbourne.

693
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,273
He puts five quid on a horse
and wins 200.

694
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,318
And here I am playing barber
to a mob of greasy sheep.

695
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,948
You're doing all right
out of greasy sheep. We all are.

696
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,838
I'm halfway to paying off
me radio shop.

697
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,592
I hate to say it, but Bluey's right.

698
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,558
One more season, and I'll own
the neatest pub you've ever seen.

699
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,950
A cheerful place that will be.

700
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,029
Come on, you blokes. Let's go!

701
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,351
- Oh, come on. What's the matter with-?
- Back to the torture chamber.

702
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,839
Come on.

703
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,275
Gotta get this thing going.

704
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,348
- Made it again.
- Good on you, missus.

705
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,074
Hey, wasn't that the starting bell?

706
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,996
They can start without me.

707
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,954
I'm gonna have a cuppa tea
with my missus.

708
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,236
Well, good on you.

709
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,440
You know, we haven't said 10 words
to each other all week?

710
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,749
I know.

711
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,597
What about going to town
on Saturday night?

712
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,957
You know, have a few drinks, talk.
What do you say?

713
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,997
Oh, I'd love it, Paddy.

714
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,752
Tell you what.

715
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,070
You let me have half a quid
out of the jam jar...

716
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,549
...I'll treat you like a bloke
with his first girl.

717
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,631
Ten shillings? Oh, I don't know.

718
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,438
Oh, come on, Ide.

719
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,319
I break me back for you.
Let me have a bit of fun.

720
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,074
Right-o. Saturday night it is, eh?

721
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,156
Spending the night in Cawndilla?

722
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,398
Would a cup of hot, strong tea
be possible?

723
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,597
A few more visits to Mrs. Firth
and you're gonna end up married.

724
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,194
I've paid many visits
to many Mrs. Firths all my life...

725
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,554
...and I'm still free.

726
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,075
- It's all a question of technique.
- Yeah.

727
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,710
But let's leave my problems
and consider yours.

728
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,713
Your good man seemed almost cheerful.

729
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,154
No, not really.

730
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,629
This job's got him down
worse than I expected.

731
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:11,713
Well, he's a man who hates routine.
What he need is a little excitement.

732
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,154
But where's he gonna get it?

733
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,073
Barring some sheep turning round
and shearing him.

734
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,992
Tea's up.

735
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,879
Time for a smoko, mate.

736
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,713
Right-o, let's stretch the spine for a bit.

737
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,468
Gentlemen, I have a sudden yen
for some nice, clean, easy money.

738
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:51,076
- Do you wanna start a two-up game?
- We'd only take money from each other.

739
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,151
What we want
is to take it from someone else.

740
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,833
What are you talking about?

741
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,118
In this shed, we have a gun shearer
who's among the fastest I've ever seen.

742
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,473
- Paddy.
- Exactly.

743
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,151
A shearing contest.

744
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,914
Well, I ain't no flaming
world's champion, you know.

745
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,799
Didn't say you were,
but let's have none of this hanging back.

746
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,552
Can't stand false modesty.

747
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,792
Well, if you blokes wanna risk
your money on me, I'll give it a burl.

748
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,794
Hey, Paddy!

749
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,315
Saturday night,
and you're just standing around?

750
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,072
Shearers ain't what they used to be.

751
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,117
Quinlan's taking us all in to Cawndilla.

752
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,999
We're going to fix up a shearing contest
with the Mulgrue mob.

753
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,355
- They're bound to be in town.
- Come on in with us.

754
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,432
I promised the missus I'd take her out.
She'd kill me if I welshed.

755
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,672
That's how it is when a bloke's married.
Can't call his soul his own.

756
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,398
- I tell you.
- You tell him, Ocker.

757
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,596
What about you, Sean?
You off to the pictures?

758
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,716
Rupe's taking me to a play,
with live actors.

759
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,678
Not very live probably,
it's just a small touring company.

760
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,913
- Don't start tearing it down in advance.
- No, it's a fine night, stars are shining.

761
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,877
My missus is all dolled up for me.

762
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,679
Let's not anybody
start tearing anything down.

763
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,989
Should have a tie, really.

764
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,392
What's the matter, darl?

765
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,672
You ain't dressed.

766
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,831
Paddy. Paddy, I can't go.
Liz is pretty close.

767
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,797
I just can't take a chance and leave her.

768
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,393
Why can't Bluey sit with her?

769
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,074
- What about the Halsteads?
- None of them know what to do.

770
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,879
Besides, she wants Bluey to go out
and have a good time.

771
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,110
I've been looking forward
to this all week long.

772
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,273
You think I haven't?
But you can understand, can't you?

773
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,431
Well, I suppose so.

774
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,709
Look, why don't we just forget
about going to town?

775
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,678
We go down by the tent
and build a fire, sit around and talk.

776
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,070
Pretend we're back on the track again.

777
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,310
We'll save ourselves 10 bob.

778
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,792
Well, you see, Liz asked
if she could bring her knitting over...

779
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,473
...and sit with me, company-like.

780
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,631
I thought you were going out
with the men-

781
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,429
What'd you have to do that for, Ide?
You didn't ask me about it.

782
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:30,035
- Hey, Bluey! What are you doing?
- Blue! Hey!

783
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,509
Come on, Bluey!

784
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,432
Thanks, Ide.

785
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,957
Hey, come on, Paddy.

786
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,190
Paddy, I wish you'd go along
and have a few beers. I'd feel better.

787
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,079
Besides, I need you to go
to see that Bluey gets back early...

788
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,549
...and not too drunk. Will you?

789
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,513
Right. Hey, Quinlan, wait for me!

790
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:19,311
Hey, Bluey, what are you gonna call
this girl of yours when she's born?

791
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:23,314
Ocker, I told you a dozen times,
it's gonna be a boy.

792
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,359
- That's right, ain't it, Paddy?
- Anything you say, Bluey.

793
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,751
Hey, Bluey. You ain't drinking
too much, are you?

794
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,354
- Oh, no.
- Right-o.

795
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,519
Why do you say this man of yours
can beat any shearer we got?

796
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,036
Is that just a figure of speech, or do you
have in mind, for example, money?

797
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,714
I got in mind, for example, 20 quid.

798
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,759
Beside what the rest of the blokes in my
team have in their minds, you follow?

799
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,590
When we was mixing it
by the trucks that day...

800
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,991
...I couldn't help but notice you kept
leading with your right, like this:

801
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,116
No offense,
but that's why I smeared you.

802
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,636
- My right's where I pack my punch.
- And where you leave yourself open.

803
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,314
Now, why don't you try
something like this:

804
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,991
- See?
- Like this, you mean?

805
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,752
- Watch it, Turk!
- Careful, mate!

806
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,752
See what I mean?

807
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,870
Friends, Romans, shearers.

808
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,270
Hello, Sean. How did you like the play?

809
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,839
Oh, don't question him, madame.

810
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,072
Don't waken him from his dream.
He fell in love with the leading lady.

811
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,674
- Honest truth, give a bloke a go.
- Oh, no shame in that.

812
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,277
When I was your age, I was
head over heels in love with Lily Langtry.

813
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:34,319
And now, my mulga-scrub lily,
I'm head over heels in love with you.

814
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,596
Oh, no.

815
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,478
Hey, Sean.

816
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,270
Oh, hello, Dad. Didn't see you.

817
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,953
What are you doing all by yourself?

818
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,998
I like being by myself,
except for you, of course.

819
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,071
My own family.

820
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,073
Your mother wouldn't come with me.
Should've taken you.

821
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,356
But I was going to the play with Rupe.

822
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,748
That's what I mean.

823
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,276
All my family seems to be
spending their time with somebody else.

824
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,117
Madame, the memory of-

825
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,829
The memory of your bell-like laughter
keeps calling me back.

826
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,468
Oh, Rupe. Those duke's daughters
must miss you.

827
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,394
The duke's daughters. They haven't
heard half the things I want to say.

828
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,870
- Can't we go?
- Oh, I can't leave the till, Rupe. Not yet.

829
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,079
Well, have I come to this?
A cash register as a rival?

830
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,391
Gert. I'm back, Gert.

831
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,836
How's the cold you had in your chest?
Matter of fact, how's your chest?

832
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,833
- You miss me while I was gone?
- Certainly not.

833
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,879
- Who the devil's this, Gert?
- Hello, Jack. This here's Rupe Venneker.

834
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,759
Rupe, this is Jack Patchogue,
mayor of Cawndilla.

835
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,512
He's a sort of friend.

836
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,875
- Pleased to meet you, Venneker.
- Patchogue.

837
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,954
"Sort of friend"?
Gert, what's been going on here?

838
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,599
Now, you pull your head in, Jack.

839
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,035
What I do with my spare time
is my own affair.

840
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,794
- Now, listen to me.
- Yes, you do that, Your Worship.

841
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,428
And I'll be next door
warming the cockles of my heart...

842
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,431
...for you-know-who.

843
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,200
You're gonna die laughing at him, Jack.

844
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,873
And you should've heard the words.

845
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,998
When you think it's the same language,
you say, "Pass the salt in"-

846
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,151
- You just can't understand how they-
- Sean.

847
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,514
Sean, have a beer.

848
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,035
- What?
- Have a beer.

849
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,839
You went to the play with Rupe
because that's what he likes.

850
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,275
Now have a beer with me
because that's what I like.

851
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,514
All right.

852
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,038
Here, love, small beer.

853
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,914
Just wish Mum could see me now.

854
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,316
Now, where is the doctor?

855
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,948
But he must have said
when he'd be back, I-

856
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,351
I'm sorry I yelled, but please,
send him over the minute he gets in.

857
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,875
The doctor's at the Jameson place,
20 miles from here.

858
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,110
You think you might catch him
before he leaves?

859
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,998
I can have a go.

860
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,351
- What will we do?
- Be a welcoming committee.

861
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,796
That baby's on its way,
doctor or no doctor.

862
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,717
Well, I better help Liz get into bed.

863
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,915
Mrs. Carmody, I don't want Jean
to be frightened.

864
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,277
Well, you think we should let Liz
have that baby alone?

865
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,159
Give Jean credit, Mr. Halstead.

866
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,470
She's a strong girl.
She'll do what she has to do.

867
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,552
Right. Try Mrs. Firth's pub,
see if our mob's there.

868
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:25,190
If not, try every pub in town.
They're bound to be in one of them.

869
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,594
Nobody home.
There's nobody home but me.

870
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,479
And I'm in terrible hurry.

871
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,835
We played lots of tennis at school
and did a lot of surfing.

872
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,514
Sydney's lovely in the summer.

873
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,477
Couldn't find him.

874
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,830
Ida, I feel crook.

875
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,994
- Starting to hurt quite a lot.
- Not for nothing, Liz.

876
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,154
I'll try to be good.

877
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,629
Don't. You scream the house down
if it helps.

878
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,439
If she doesn't, I probably will.

879
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,519
- Ida, how long were you with Sean?
- It's different every time, you know.

880
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,035
Bluey. I want Bluey.

881
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,952
- Hang on, Liz.
- I want Bluey with me.

882
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,917
- You'll be all right, Liz.
- Bluey.

883
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,557
- I'll get him.
- What?

884
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,790
I'll go into town, find him,
and bring him back.

885
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,837
All right, but don't be long.

886
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,720
Hello. What are you doing here,
Mrs. Halstead?

887
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,075
I'm looking for Bluey.

888
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,273
- Hello, love.
- Have you seen Bluey Brown?

889
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,637
Where is he, I said?
Oh, get away from me.

890
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,156
Oh, here he- Bluey? Here he is, love.

891
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,199
Right over here.

892
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,432
Look at him. Full as a goog.

893
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,477
It's just that after-hours drinking.

894
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,837
Well, sober him up and be quick about it.
Liz wants him.

895
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,398
Oh, hey. Hey, Bluey! Hey.

896
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,152
Hey, Bluey.

897
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,032
- You're having a baby.
- I know that.

898
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,030
It's lambing time at Wattle Run!

899
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,159
- I'll lay a quid it's a boy!
- Neither one, it's twins!

900
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,392
Come on! Come on, you!

901
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:52,192
- I'll lay a quid it's a boy!
- Neither one, it's twins!

902
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,072
Come on, you blokes! I'm driving!

903
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,354
I couldn't get the doc.
He's gone out to Big Billabong.

904
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:12,355
Bob, I must go and help Ida.
See that the men get Bluey sobered up.

905
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,593
Well, here he is, Ide.

906
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:34,036
All in one piece,
and almost as good as new.

907
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,156
Shut up, all of you!

908
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,118
Well, stone the flaming crows,
if it ain't old Ide.

909
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,316
Good on you, Ide!

910
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,594
Well, thanks for all your kind help!

911
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,469
Now then, get him sobered up. I don't
care how you do it, but do it quick.

912
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,596
What am I, his flaming keeper
or something?

913
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,992
Hello, Mum. I saw my first play
and had my first beer tonight.

914
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,517
Aren't you his keeper either?

915
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,794
Ida, hurry.

916
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,510
Come on now, Liz. Push.

917
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,239
That's it. Now harder. Come on.

918
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,316
There's a girl.

919
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,320
Here, Jean. Let her pull on your hands.

920
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,510
Well, here he is, what's left of him.

921
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,432
The rest is down the hill.

922
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,160
Well, he looks shrunk, but human.

923
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:05,313
Ida. Oh, Ida, I feel crook.

924
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,632
No, you don't, Bluey.
Go on in and say hello to your son.

925
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,235
Oh, I gotta tell the fellas.

926
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,556
Well, this is the first baby
born on Wattle Run that isn't a sheep.

927
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,036
Won't be the last, I hope.

928
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,590
What are you two talking about?

929
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,599
- Morning.
- You're up early.

930
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,796
Well, I needed something to do.

931
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,997
- I told Turk to tell you-
- Yes, yes, he told me. Thanks.

932
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,957
Didn't want you to worry.

933
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,271
- All right, look-
- Paddy.

934
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,875
Before you say anything, I...

935
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:26,079
- I'm sorry about last night.
- It's all right.

936
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,149
I'm sorry about Sean, for that matter.

937
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,675
I don't know what I was thinking about.

938
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,992
- It was just one beer, Ide.
- Well, won't kill him, eh?

939
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,436
Everything all right, then?

940
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,593
Yeah.

941
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,473
Only...

942
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,029
...I'm turning in my time tomorrow.

943
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,199
We're leaving Saturday night,
right after work.

944
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,836
We've been here six weeks, Ide.

945
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,070
You needed a change, you said.
All right.

946
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,231
Well, ain't six weeks long enough?

947
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:14,433
Listen, Ide. Everything's going wrong
between us since we've been here.

948
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,875
We never see Sean anymore.
We never see each other.

949
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,350
When we do, we're dead tired or there's
a hundred strangers hanging around.

950
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,114
It isn't staying I care about,
it's the money we're making.

951
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,316
We don't need the money.
We've never needed it.

952
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:28,517
We need it now. I want a home, Paddy,
just like Sean does.

953
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,877
I don't want to ride that wagon
right into my grave.

954
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,998
Oh, what good does it do
turning away every time I say it?

955
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,958
I told you in the beginning,
I couldn't get stuck in one place.

956
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,269
I had to keep on the move.

957
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,398
You kept on saying it was all right.
Now, what'd you wanna lie for?

958
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,073
I never promised I wouldn't change.

959
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,435
I never promised I wouldn't get older
and scared.

960
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,433
What do you mean? You think I can't
take care of you and the kid?

961
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,397
We're both getting older. It's time we-

962
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:56,236
- Don't talk for me. I'm not finished yet.
- I'm just trying to look ahead, Paddy.

963
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,470
Well, I'm not looking past Saturday.

964
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,551
That's when I'm gonna go.

965
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,635
You and Sean
don't wanna come with me?

966
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,432
Well, don't.

967
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,517
Hey, Paddy.

968
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,711
Wait a minute, will you?

969
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,920
Everything's right for the contest
with the Mulgrue bunch.

970
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,958
It's okay with the boss too,
so we fixed it for Saturday.

971
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,839
- We're depending on you.
- I don't want nobody depending on me.

972
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,070
- You better get somebody else.
- Stone the crows.

973
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,834
You heard us make the plans
last night. You didn't stop us.

974
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,117
I was drunk last night.

975
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,593
I ain't gonna split a gut just so I can say
I'm faster than some other bloke.

976
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,594
That dirty dingo.
A man ought to knock his head off.

977
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,954
He could have his reasons.

978
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,714
Oh, blast his reasons.
He's backing out like a yellow dog.

979
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,316
How we gonna look, going over
to Mulgrue's, telling him it's all off?

980
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,072
Oh, maybe we're better off this way.

981
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,835
A dingo like that, he'd probably throw
his hand in halfway through the contest.

982
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,875
Dad just told the men
he wouldn't be in the contest...

983
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,190
...after letting them set it up
for next Saturday.

984
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,669
He wants us to leave next Saturday.

985
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,310
Then how will we ever
get enough money for a place?

986
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,754
He doesn't care about a place.

987
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,831
He's going
whether we go with him or not...

988
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,116
...and that's how strong
he feels about it, Sean.

989
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:27,068
- But we never split up before.
- And we're not gonna split up now.

990
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:31,477
I'm gonna stay, Mum.
And I think you ought to stay too.

991
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,471
Sean, you've got your whole life to live.

992
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,835
We're halfway through ours,
your dad and me.

993
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,797
There are other people waiting for you...

994
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,394
...but there's no one waiting for us
except each other.

995
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,994
Don't ever ask me to choose
between you and your dad...

996
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,151
...because I'll choose him every time.

997
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,839
Good day.

998
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,148
Mum says you're leaving Saturday.

999
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,994
I got me own reasons, Sean.
You're too young to understand.

1000
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,153
I get sick of being told I'm too young,
like it's a disease or something.

1001
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,994
I told Rupe there'd be no sense
talking to you.

1002
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,628
What right have you got
going over our business with him?

1003
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:27,270
He was sticking up for you. He didn't
think you were a dingo, like Clint said.

1004
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,396
I'll fix that Clint later.

1005
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,472
The minute you turn your back,
people go around talking about you.

1006
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,313
There's not one of them game enough
to say it to me face.

1007
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:42,035
I think you're a dingo
for running out on Mum and me.

1008
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,837
Don't hit me, Dad, or you can leave
and I'll never come after you.

1009
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,798
Don't ever talk like that
to me again, Sean.

1010
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,992
I might have killed you.

1011
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,994
You're not gonna leave, are you, Dad?
Please don't.

1012
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,074
- Hey, Paddy, can we see you?
- Just a minute.

1013
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,196
It's the men. All of them, Dad.

1014
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,352
I know, Sean. I feel crook about it, but-

1015
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,990
Well, they just can't back down.

1016
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,630
If there was only some way...

1017
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,239
Yeah?

1018
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,156
We have a new plan, Carmody.

1019
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,357
- What plan?
- A plan for the competition.

1020
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,308
We want the Mulgrues to see that
we have a man in whom we're proud.

1021
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,389
Cut it out, will you?

1022
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:47,951
But the main object is to raise money
for a worthy cause.

1023
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,793
Christening present for Bluey's baby.

1024
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,312
Well, crikey. Why didn't you say so?

1025
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,516
I didn't know it was anything like that.

1026
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,956
Doesn't mean we can't bet on the side.
We can still make a pile of money.

1027
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,755
As long as Bluey's nipper
gets a big piece of it...

1028
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,797
...I'll be only too happy to give it a go.

1029
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,758
You beaut, Dad.

1030
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,309
Hey, let us in on the secret.

1031
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:14,278
It's the shearing contest.
It's all set up for next Saturday.

1032
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,953
Well, now.

1033
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:20,989
I come over to give you all an invite
to a party in honor of Bluey's baby.

1034
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,118
But it seems to me as though
he's gonna have to share it...

1035
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,032
...with Paddy, the people's choice.

1036
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:33,629
Right-o, boys. Next Sunday at the pub,
beer, saveloys and sausage rolls.

1037
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,190
Come on, Rupe. Walk me to the car.

1038
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,151
How does that bloke do it?

1039
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:01,119
Ide, I was thinking...

1040
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,670
...since I have to stay here
for the contest anyway...

1041
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:09,148
...might as well stay
to the end of the season.

1042
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,032
Well, how about a cuppa?
You haven't had a bite all day, have you?

1043
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,838
T oo right.

1044
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:22,270
- You hungry?
- No, I'll have an earbash with the boys.

1045
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,032
See you later.

1046
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:04,151
Carmody, there isn't a living soul
in Wattle Run who hasn't bet on you.

1047
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,914
Even a couple sheep have been trying
to get a word with me.

1048
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,355
I just hope this Mulgrue mob's
brought enough money.

1049
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,839
I'm not guaranteeing anything.

1050
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,639
None of that. No modesty.
It's confidence gonna win the day.

1051
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,360
It is? Well, that's good.
I was afraid it was gonna be me.

1052
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,677
Hey, here comes the Mulgrue mob.

1053
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:35,315
Johnson. Are you the challenger?

1054
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,912
I don't know why they picked me,
I'm the worst man we got.

1055
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:44,073
I ain't counting any chickens, Herb.

1056
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,073
Don't rush it, Carmody.
Just keep a nice, steady pace.

1057
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,913
Two hundred and ninety
should be enough to win.

1058
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,358
I've heard bull in me time,
but that takes some beating.

1059
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,315
Well, if you're gonna do it, let's do it.

1060
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,914
You're here, stand number four.

1061
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,753
Here, Wilson.
Keep your eye on those, will you?

1062
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,433
You gonna unscrew your wooden leg?

1063
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,718
No, we don't want
to embarrass the champ.

1064
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,990
They must be off their rockers,
that Mulgrue bunch.

1065
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,799
- He's 80 if he's a day.
- Paddy'll make a monkey out of him.

1066
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,555
I wouldn't wanna show him up,
anything like that. It wouldn't be right.

1067
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,596
Hey, Clint, lay a fiver for me, will you?

1068
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,352
- You're on, mate.
- Just win, Dad.

1069
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,239
We got a quid on you,
Mum and me. Good luck.

1070
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,789
The contestants will work
in two-hour stretches...

1071
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,758
...with five-minute rests
and one hour for a meal.

1072
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,559
The score will be kept jointly
by our Mr. Quinlan...

1073
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,517
...and Mr. Wilson of Mulgrue's.

1074
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,910
May the best man win.

1075
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,514
- Stand by.
- Come on. Hey.

1076
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,518
Go for your quota, Paddy.

1077
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:40,399
You won't get any compo
if you collapse, Herbie.

1078
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,438
That little runt couldn't bag a hussy.

1079
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,109
Work from the hip, Carmody.
Now, easy follow-through.

1080
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,271
Follow through with that instrument,
come on.

1081
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:59,514
- How does he look?
- Fresh as a babe.

1082
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:03,719
You've been flat out like a lizard drinking,
but he's been with you all the way.

1083
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,916
It's shocking.

1084
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,312
That cove ain't human.

1085
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,477
Try not to show him that you're nervous.

1086
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:24,269
In fact, it might be good psychology
if you could manage a hearty laugh.

1087
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:27,716
You laugh.
I can't think of anything funny.

1088
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,509
- We could tickle you.
- Don't worry, Dad. He can't keep it up.

1089
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,513
- That ain't what I'm worried about.
- Paddy, his legs'll give out.

1090
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:38,389
- You got a long way to go yet.
- That's what I'm worried about.

1091
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,755
Stand by.

1092
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,316
Break for lunch.

1093
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,754
That little old weasel.

1094
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,990
- What I'd give to have money on him.
- Ocker!

1095
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,596
Do you practice being a louse
or does it just come natural?

1096
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:03,389
Dad, you've got an hour.

1097
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,994
- Go and lie down. I'll bring your-
- No, he mustn't.

1098
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,074
It'd give Johnson
an immense psychological advantage...

1099
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,879
...to know that
Paddy's lying flat on his back.

1100
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,198
He hasn't even come outside.

1101
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:19,070
Has it occurred to you that he may be
too exhausted even to reach the door?

1102
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,878
I'm gonna go lie down in the tent.

1103
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,598
- Paddy-
- Rupe.

1104
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,594
We may be neck and neck
in the shearing...

1105
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,509
...but psychologically,
he's got me licked.

1106
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,909
- Ten for Johnny Sanford.
- Ten for Johnny Sanford.

1107
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,674
- Two for Willis Jacobs.
- Right, two for Jacobs.

1108
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,877
Ten for Costello. Four for Pierce.

1109
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,759
All right, four for Pierce.

1110
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:09,032
And a tenner for you, Wilson.
Do you want that now, Wilson?

1111
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,713
Bluey.

1112
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,233
I'm sorry I didn't win
for your little nipper, Bluey.

1113
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:24,358
Don't worry about it, Paddy.
You did your best.

1114
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:34,318
And three for Sandy Sanderson,
and that's the lot.

1115
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:39,193
Well, good day. I've enjoyed meself.

1116
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,396
Thanks for asking us.

1117
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,750
Poor Dad.
Just when he was feeling cheerful.

1118
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,270
He'll stay cheerful,
once we're on the move again.

1119
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:13,154
- Sean, remember that farm in Bulinga?
- Remember it?

1120
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:16,118
Whenever we talk about a place,
that's the one I'm thinking of.

1121
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,111
It's still for sale.

1122
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:21,078
Mrs. Bateman wrote me.
I didn't wanna tell you about it before.

1123
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,708
I suppose those farms
don't get sold very quick.

1124
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,440
- Did she say how much it costs?
- Two thousand pounds.

1125
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,875
At the end of the season,
we'll have better than 400.

1126
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,235
That's enough for a down payment.

1127
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,675
That's if Dad wanted a place.

1128
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,631
First we'll get the money,
then we'll worry about Dad.

1129
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,712
Speaking of Dad,
this doesn't seem tactful, somehow.

1130
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,312
Quiet.

1131
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,873
Quiet!

1132
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,554
Quiet!

1133
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:24,999
Right-o, who's for peeling potatoes?

1134
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,109
Hey, fellas!

1135
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,078
Listen, there's a room outside
with sawdust on the floor.

1136
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,593
How is it for a game of two-up?

1137
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:44,438
I've got a feeling
it's us for peeling potatoes.

1138
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,068
Woman's instinct, I call that.

1139
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,829
Well, go on, booby.

1140
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,951
Come on, girls.

1141
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:55,953
Where are all those big betters?
Are we all here?

1142
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:57,475
I'm for five.

1143
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,518
- Here's five quid to say I can head them.
- I'll set the center.

1144
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,272
- I'll bet he heads them.
- Thirty bob.

1145
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,510
- A pound he heads them.
- A pound he tails them.

1146
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,750
Two bob he tails them!

1147
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:09,036
- Yes, I'll set you.
- Right.

1148
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,679
- You all set on the side?
- Yeah.

1149
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,319
Right-o, come in, spinner.

1150
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,232
Now, fair go.

1151
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,873
Up they go, and it's a head up.

1152
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,758
And it's... tails!

1153
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:22,394
I won. You should've bet
the same as me, Dad.

1154
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,120
- Son, you see, I only had a quid left-
- I'll bet the ten.

1155
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,555
Excuse me, Dad.
Don't wanna miss the next toss.

1156
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,756
Four bob, he tails them.

1157
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:31,474
Four pounds, head.

1158
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:35,996
Serving beer on Sundays
and running a gambling joint?

1159
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,833
I could get 12 months in jail
and lose me license.

1160
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,877
Why don't you make them
stop the game then?

1161
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,998
Oh, let them have their fun.
They don't get much, the men out here.

1162
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:47,072
They battle all their lives
just to try and stay ahead of nature...

1163
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:49,196
...keeping this part of the country alive.

1164
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,157
And when they're dead,
they're forgotten.

1165
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,039
Nobody thanks them.
All they get is abuse.

1166
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:58,315
Getting drunk on Sunday and gambling
may be against the law...

1167
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,471
...but the law was made
by city wowsers.

1168
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:04,269
They don't know nothing of what it
takes to keep a man alive out here.

1169
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:07,432
Beer, that's what it takes, Gert. Beer.

1170
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,950
Well, it's not like you
to leave a two-up game.

1171
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:13,475
What happened, your luck run out?

1172
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,271
Anybody home?

1173
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:23,151
I'm the owner. What'll it be, a room?

1174
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:25,197
Yes, missus, and tucker,
if you can manage.

1175
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,794
Evan Evans, the name is.
Just delivered a mob of sheep.

1176
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,951
I'm a drover myself.
Paddy Carmody's my name.

1177
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,839
- You're late in the season.
- Ran into a card game on the way.

1178
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:33,989
Lasted a month.

1179
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,351
Any place my sulky and horses
can get shelter?

1180
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:37,919
Here, I'll put them up for you.

1181
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:41,197
Oh, in case you're interested,
there's a two-up game going on in there.

1182
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,272
- Where?
- All right, skinny, after you're fed.

1183
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,953
"Skinny. "

1184
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,039
You know how much I won already?

1185
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:25,272
Four quid. What's the matter, Dad?
You're not playing.

1186
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:26,714
I ain't got no money.

1187
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,110
Which, if you had eyes,
you could see for yourself.

1188
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,590
Well, do you want a loan?
Take anything, Dad. Take it all.

1189
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,230
A quid'll do me. A quid he tails them.

1190
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,516
Come in, spinner!

1191
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,959
- Tails, it is.
- Beauty.

1192
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,758
You'll do me for a good luck charm.

1193
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:44,558
Two quid he tails them again.

1194
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:46,399
Fifteen years in a pub...

1195
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,677
...and I still prefer a good cuppa tea
to a bottle of beer.

1196
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,751
Of course, I gotta get drunk
now and then...

1197
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,070
...to set an example to the customers.

1198
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:57,152
More tea, Ide?
I'm going to miss the whole lot of you.

1199
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,038
Just a couple of more weeks, isn't it?

1200
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:01,270
Don't give me much time
to work on Rupe.

1201
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,473
Heads!

1202
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,478
- A fiver on tails.
- You're on.

1203
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,710
He's going again. He's going again.

1204
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:22,354
Oh, come on. This is a party,
and the food's ready.

1205
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,074
- Is that all the money you got?
- Yeah.

1206
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:32,751
- Another fiver he tails them.
- You're covered.

1207
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:35,229
- Paddy's won 17 straight tosses.
- What?

1208
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:39,552
- I loaned him money, changed his luck.
- All right, come in, spinner.

1209
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:43,358
You got it, Paddy!

1210
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,230
- How much has Paddy won?
- About 200 quid.

1211
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,672
Sean, with what's left in the jar...

1212
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,274
...that's almost enough
for a down payment on the farm.

1213
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,789
Well, what do you reckon?
You lost a packet already.

1214
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,428
Don't worry about me, friend.
This is the air I breathe.

1215
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,591
You've cleaned me out.
That's the way it goes.

1216
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,557
I'll tell you what, mate.

1217
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,637
You put up that horse you got outside...

1218
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,075
...I'll bet everything I've won tonight
against him.

1219
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,276
One toss of the pennies,
what do you say?

1220
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,149
What do I say when I won him
in a poker game anyway?

1221
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,880
You're on, friend. And I call tails.

1222
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,871
Chilla, you ready?

1223
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,993
Brother Carmody,
you've got yourself a racehorse.

1224
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,355
- Make more of him than I did.
- And the money, Mum.

1225
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:36,839
And the money too.

1226
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:40,871
Oh, you- You won!

1227
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,833
Gee, Dad, ain't he wonderful to watch?

1228
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,238
Ever since I was a kid...

1229
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,756
...the thing I wanted most in the world
was a horse like that.

1230
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,599
You reckon you could ride him flat out
and not fall off him?

1231
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,479
Could I? You just watch me.

1232
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,348
Go, Sean!

1233
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:48,274
Come on, you little beauty! Let's have it!

1234
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,960
Look at him go! You beauty!

1235
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:03,994
Well, how is he?

1236
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,469
Oh, darl, he's a beauty.

1237
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,995
- What you gonna do with him?
- When we quit here...

1238
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:12,391
...let's take him round to some of
the small bush tracks, picnic races.

1239
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,028
Everything works out,
we'll head for a big race meeting.

1240
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,428
Could we go back to Bulinga?

1241
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,433
- They run a cup meeting and we-
- We could see Kylie Bateman?

1242
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:22,269
No, Mum. That wasn't
what I was thinking about.

1243
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,713
Well, why not?
All right, we'll make it Bulinga...

1244
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:31,394
...and we'll stop
and talk to the Batemans on the way.

1245
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:34,155
Got the makings
of a real champion there, haven't we?

1246
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:37,392
Yes, if he's looked after properly,
and I shall see to it that he is.

1247
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:39,551
Why, you know something
about training horses?

1248
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,438
Is there anything he don't know about?

1249
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,637
I was brought up among horses,
English horses.

1250
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,234
Epsom Downs was my second home.

1251
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:50,836
Come on, come on.
What do you think this is, bush week?

1252
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,831
I wonder where
the nearest race course is?

1253
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,036
We could clean up a packet
if Paddy'd race him.

1254
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,351
Come on. You're like
a lot of flaming old hens!

1255
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:02,559
Can't you just see us, darl?
Still moving, going from track to track.

1256
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:05,996
The Carmodys, not just drovers anymore,
but racehorse owners.

1257
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:09,072
Come down to earth. You'll be
winning the Melbourne Cup next.

1258
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,434
Well, why not?

1259
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:12,875
Did you ever dream you'd have
200 quid in the kick...

1260
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,998
- ... besides owning a racehorse?
- We'll have to name the brute.

1261
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:17,878
Hey, that's right.

1262
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:21,117
We could call him Dynamite.
Or what about Fireball?

1263
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,396
Fireball? Grotesque.

1264
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:27,314
No, no. Something classical
would be more appropriate.

1265
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:30,517
Wait. Why don't we call him
Sundowner?

1266
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,309
Yeah, I like that.

1267
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:36,358
Sundowner. What does that mean?
I've been called that on occasion.

1268
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:37,999
I assumed it was a term of abuse.

1269
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:40,390
No, that's the Australian word
for people like us.

1270
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,393
A sundowner is someone whose home
is where the sun goes down.

1271
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:46,836
It's the same as saying
someone who doesn't have a home.

1272
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,750
Quinlan's gonna sack you
if this keeps up.

1273
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,195
Old friend Quinlan
is the least of my worries.

1274
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:06,554
Care for a cuppa?

1275
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,154
You're very chipper.
Is it the prospect of wandering...

1276
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,709
...from race course to race course
which delights you?

1277
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:15,111
Or Bulinga, with its farm for sale?

1278
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,750
If Paddy knew what was in my mind,
he'd be scared to death.

1279
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:22,037
I want him to look at the farm
before he gets his back up.

1280
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,873
Now, since this is nosy day
at Wattle Run...

1281
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,076
...what are you gonna do
about Mrs. Firth?

1282
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:31,552
Mrs. Firth? I'm going to say goodbye
to Mrs. Firth.

1283
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:35,270
She's a dear little body, isn't she?
I just hope I don't hurt her feelings.

1284
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:39,194
Don't you worry about her losing you.
She isn't losing one damned thing.

1285
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,715
- Ida, I thought you were my friend.
- I am your friend.

1286
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,589
- I just don't like you much right now.
- I don't like myself very much.

1287
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,957
Perhaps it would be better if I didn't
accompany your family to Bulinga.

1288
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,917
We'd be glad to have you,
and you know it.

1289
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,991
Though why you want to beats me.

1290
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:56,197
Well, I'm a kind of elderly turtle, Ida.

1291
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:59,318
Hard shell, soft belly,
wealth of experience.

1292
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:03,439
Not much of a mind to make use of it.
Always in the soup.

1293
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:06,271
No joke intended.

1294
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,989
And this turtle can't share its shell
with anyone.

1295
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,993
But only when it finds people
who really belong to each other...

1296
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,639
...as Paddy and you do...

1297
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:20,958
...it becomes attached,
like a household pet.

1298
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,151
Not a very well-trained one at that.

1299
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:28,313
Oh, go on with you, Rupe.

1300
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,910
Liz, you think the train trip
will be too much?

1301
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,551
Not nearly as much
as all this saying goodbye.

1302
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,193
Here.

1303
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,552
Hopeless.

1304
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,032
Hey, look at Ollie.

1305
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,110
Three times now
he's run back to the cook house.

1306
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,759
I don't think he wants to go.

1307
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:09,150
I don't feel so good meself.

1308
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,629
Listen, Sean,
there's something I wanna say.

1309
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:14,553
I just hope my kid turns out
to be like you.

1310
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,109
- Hey, Bluey.
- Yeah.

1311
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:21,795
You hear the latest?
Ocker's thinking of getting married.

1312
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,632
What's so funny about it?

1313
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:27,395
I've been engaged eight years
trying to decide.

1314
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:32,315
Speaking of getting married,
I hope the great lover's getting an earful.

1315
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:36,919
Now then, Rupe, we've had
a lot of fun, and no harm done.

1316
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,958
And why you're getting this
hangdog look, I don't know.

1317
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:41,951
All I want to say to you is...

1318
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:46,159
...drop in again sometime,
and take your chances.

1319
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,275
Couldn't pin him down.
Not without breaking his leg.

1320
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:58,114
Well, someone's gotta take the plunge.

1321
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:59,713
- Hooroo.
- Hooroo, Turk.

1322
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:01,552
Be seeing you.

1323
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:18,475
Everybody for the track, in the truck.

1324
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:22,838
Next stop, Big Billabong
and another 50,000 wooly jumbucks.

1325
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,553
Goodbye. Goodbye.

1326
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,678
Bye-bye.

1327
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:54,471
Come on, Sean! Come on!

1328
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,555
Yes! Marvelous!

1329
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:40,358
Look at the chest on him, huh?

1330
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,839
What do you think of him, Ern?

1331
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,673
I'd swap the missus for him
any day in the week.

1332
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,438
He'll pay for that.

1333
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,192
All the same, he's a real champ.

1334
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:51,557
He'll stand a chance being a champ
if we start at the Bulinga Cup.

1335
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:53,312
You can camp right on the farm, Ida.

1336
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:57,309
Just drop in on the agent as you pass
through Bulinga. I told him you would.

1337
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:00,279
- What farm?
- Oh, the Owens' farm.

1338
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,271
The one Sean and I were so keen on.

1339
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:04,271
Annie wrote me it was still for sale.

1340
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:07,113
It's a nice little place, Paddy.
You can grow anything on it.

1341
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,556
I didn't think there'd be any harm
taking a look at it, darl.

1342
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,310
Well, looks like I got the Sundowner
just in time.

1343
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,596
Otherwise you'd have me
pinned under a mortgage...

1344
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:18,239
...faster than you can say Bulinga.

1345
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,278
But as you do have the Sundowner,
why don't you camp at the farm?

1346
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:24,079
Then he can have a good roll in the sand.

1347
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,150
It'll fix up just lovely, a room like this.

1348
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,673
It's the kitchen I wanna see.

1349
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,760
Oh, my.

1350
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:52,272
Hey, they even left two beds
in one of the bedrooms.

1351
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,710
Why don't we stay
in the house tonight?

1352
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:58,440
Because it don't belong to us.

1353
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:01,751
Sean, run out
and get my bag, will you?

1354
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,158
Do you like the place?

1355
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:08,039
It's a nice enough spread,
all right, yeah.

1356
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:13,755
What's a place like this cost?

1357
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:16,669
Two thousand's the asking price for it.

1358
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:20,037
Two thou-?
You ought to have your head read.

1359
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,270
Now, why do you make yourself
and Sean feel bad?

1360
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:23,759
We ain't got money like that.

1361
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,753
Yes, we have, Paddy.
We've got enough for a down payment.

1362
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,514
I thought maybe we could
risk some tomorrow on Sundowner...

1363
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:32,513
...to get us started with the farm.
You reckon he's a sure thing.

1364
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:34,557
You know how I feel about settling.

1365
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:38,349
Look, Paddy, you can't race Sundowner
for the rest of your life.

1366
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:41,080
If you stay here,
you can put him out to stud.

1367
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:43,470
Did you ever see a better place
for raising horses?

1368
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:45,710
Stay here, you could have
the time of your life.

1369
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:47,393
It's still getting stuck.

1370
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:50,916
Rupe says he's off
to the fleshpots of Bulinga.

1371
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:01,318
What do you think, Dad?

1372
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,472
Well, it makes sense, don't it?

1373
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:07,596
Suppose I better say yes.

1374
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:11,911
- Oh, Paddy.
- We'll see the agent in the morning.

1375
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:15,238
Well, I guess I better get in town
and get our bets down...

1376
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:17,152
...before the odds shorten.

1377
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,033
Yeah.

1378
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:22,517
- How much?
- Fifty'll be all right.

1379
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,713
Right. Well, see you later.

1380
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:43,950
When'll you be back, darl?
Around sundown?

1381
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:45,792
Soon as I can.

1382
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,038
Did he mean it?

1383
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:52,670
Yeah. Yes, he meant it.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have said it.

1384
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:54,193
Well, he didn't seem too happy.

1385
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:56,271
It's hard for him
to get used to the idea.

1386
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:58,795
He'll like it later, though.
I bet he'll like it.

1387
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,871
Of course he'll like it.

1388
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:04,794
- Now can we stay in the house?
- I don't see why not.

1389
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:32,239
Paddy?

1390
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,639
Paddy?

1391
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,954
I've done something, Ide.

1392
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:55,670
I lost the money. Two-up.

1393
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,392
We still got the money in the jar.

1394
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:07,396
I wrote IOU's. I lost it all.

1395
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:49,630
I don't know what to say.

1396
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:53,031
I looked at you both, you and Sean.
You were just like strangers.

1397
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:55,395
I wanted you to have
what you wanted...

1398
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:59,390
...but God forgive me,
I must've hated you both.

1399
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:03,189
I just wanted to get away from you, get
drunk, get the taste out of me mouth.

1400
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:07,434
That's all I meant to do, darl,
was just get drunk.

1401
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,795
That's all I meant to do.

1402
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,036
I'll make it up to you, darl.
I promise you.

1403
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:18,590
- I'll get you a place.
- No, no, no.

1404
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:22,469
Don't talk about it.
Don't talk about it.

1405
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:03,393
If it's of any use to you,
I've got about a hundred pounds.

1406
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:08,153
Oh, they'd never take that
as a down payment.

1407
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,474
Thanks, anyway.

1408
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:12,710
Just by way of covering
all the possibilities...

1409
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:16,031
...you could sell Sundowner
for a goodly sum.

1410
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:19,830
Not before the race, you couldn't.

1411
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:29,075
You'll need this to settle the IOU's.

1412
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:35,713
Will we have enough
to get us another job?

1413
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:38,952
Well, there's 50 pounds prize money
if Sundowner wins the race.

1414
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,275
We better leave
right after the race, then.

1415
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:13,554
Come on!

1416
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:26,828
Did he win?

1417
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,151
He had to, darl. He just had to.

1418
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,789
Wasn't he beaut? We had to go
round the outside of him.

1419
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,552
You'll be a better rider than I was.

1420
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,280
- Two champions on that course today.
- And we won 200 quid.

1421
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:53,318
We better collect our prize money,
start looking for another job.

1422
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:54,833
We're not going anywhere, darl.

1423
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,877
I made a deal with a bloke
before the race.

1424
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:58,951
Two hundred pounds for Sundowner
if he wins.

1425
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:00,439
That means we've got 400 quid.

1426
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:02,750
We've still got enough
for a down payment.

1427
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,798
I know what the horse means to you.

1428
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:09,476
I know what the farm means to you, Ide.

1429
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:13,517
You keep him.

1430
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:16,319
Yeah, Owens' farm
isn't the only farm in Australia.

1431
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,471
When we've earned something,
race him again...

1432
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:20,517
...and make enough money
for another place.

1433
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:22,989
You know what I'm like
when I've got a little money.

1434
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:27,233
- I don't trust myself, Ide.
- I trust you, darl.

1435
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:28,628
We're not selling the horse.

1436
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:32,357
Can't I do anything in my life
without getting an argument from you?

1437
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,511
- Mum, if Dad really wants to-
- Shut your gob.

1438
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:36,830
This is between your dad
and me, and it's settled.

1439
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,197
- Ida, you want a home, don't you?
- Oh, we'll have a home someday.

1440
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:42,954
This way, if we do it,
you'll hate every inch of the place.

1441
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:44,599
I don't wanna live with a martyr.

1442
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:47,069
You're the only martyr
to this family's got room for?

1443
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:50,232
- You can stop being so damn noble.
- Who said anything about being-?

1444
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:53,790
A protest has been entered
in the last race!

1445
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:59,319
Jockey Carmody,
will you report to the steward's room?

1446
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,229
I'll bet on the fences.

1447
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:28,517
Ladies and gentlemen...

1448
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:31,956
...a change in the result
of the last race!

1449
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:35,712
A protest was lodged and upheld.

1450
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:39,478
Number 17, The Sundowner...

1451
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:45,510
...and number 8, Billabong,
are disqualified for interference!

1452
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:50,595
The winner is now Cassidy Sheila!

1453
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,719
Well, you can't expect justice
on a provincial course.

1454
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:02,633
All right, where's the cow
that squealed?

1455
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:07,029
Who's running this race track, anyway,
a mob of bush rangers?

1456
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:12,511
Flaming robbers
couldn't conduct a bazaar for-

1457
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:24,397
Well, there goes both
our chances to be noble.

1458
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:45,714

He didn't do it so good,
but I tell what.

02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:50,599
I'll give you 25 quid for him.

02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:58,955
Oh, take off, friend.
The horse is not for sale.

Come on, you two.
