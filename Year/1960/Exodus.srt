1
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:33,116
The island of Cyprus, madam.

2
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,636
World famous for beauty and long, tragic history.

3
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,356
Been conquered many times.

4
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:42,757
Conquered by Phoenicians, Assyrians,
Persians, Macedonians.

5
00:02:43,317 --> 00:02:47,757
Also conquered by Greeks, Romans,
Byzantines, Turks.

6
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:52,397
Purchased from Turkey
by your esteemed self, the British Empire.

7
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:55,277
All Cyprus most fond of the British.

8
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:58,878
I'm an American.

9
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:02,558
Fond of Americans also.
We Cypriots are fond of everybody.

10
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:04,958
Shall we go through the castle now?

11
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:07,278
No, I've changed my mind.

12
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,518
Then maybe the Tower of Othello
at the harbour of Famagusta.

13
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:13,119
- It’s included in the tour.
- All right.

14
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:25,283
What's the matter here?

15
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:28,683
Prison ship has arrived
full of Jews for the camps, madam.

16
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:32,163
- What camps?
- Detention camps out at Karaolos.

17
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:36,164
You see, the Jews, they charter a ship
from Europe to get to Palestine.

18
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:39,324
Then the British catch the ship
and send the whole bunch here.

19
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:43,524
The Arabs don't want them in Palestine.
The British don't want them here, either.

20
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:45,564
- But they got them.
- Stop!

21
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:59,165
Get him!

22
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:06,766
Maybe you can back up
and drive me to this address.

23
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:10,446
House of the British Commander.

24
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,169
Now, then.

25
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,489
- Get his feet.
- Right.

26
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,170
Up.

27
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,931
Mrs. Fremont?

28
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,371
The General's expecting you in the garden.

29
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:52,412
How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?

30
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,212
I'm very glad to see you.

31
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,892
Please sit down.

32
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,212
Found that here in the garden.

33
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:03,693
From the colour,
I'd say it belongs to the Byzantine period.

34
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:06,653
The Byzantines occupied Cyprus for centuries.

35
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:11,293
Gives one an idea how temporary
our claims to the world's real estate are.

36
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:15,213
I'm ashamed to say I really don't know
anything about archaeology.

37
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,453
Few people do.

38
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:19,734
Didn't you once publish something
about the Roman ruins in Cheltenham?

39
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:22,534
A very obscure something. How did you know?

40
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:26,574
Tom mentioned it in one of his letters.
He was very proud of your friendship.

41
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:28,334
As I was of his.

42
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:32,214
Will you have tea, or something livelier?

43
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:34,775
Something livelier, please.

44
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:38,975
- Is that ice I see?
- Surprised?

45
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:42,055
Tom got me into the habit.

46
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:46,495
Now I use ice in practically everything.

47
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:49,696
There we are.

48
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:55,336
May we drink to Tom?

49
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:57,536
Of course.

50
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:04,976
I'm extremely sorry circumstances
compelled us to bury him in the field.

51
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:08,337
Even sorrier I was transferred from Palestine...

52
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:10,337
before I got the chance to see you.

53
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:14,817
It wasn't your fault.
It took me almost a week to arrange passage.

54
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:18,017
But your letter was waiting there for me,
and Tom's things.

55
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:20,817
I really shouldn't have let him go with us.

56
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:22,578
It was only a border affair.

57
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:25,658
One of the Jewish undergrounds
had blown up half a dozen bridges.

58
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:29,258
It really wasn't important enough
to lose one's life for.

59
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:31,018
Is anything?

60
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,378
In my opinion, yes.

61
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,898
I've known many soldiers, Mrs. Fremont,
and war correspondents...

62
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,499
and news photographers,
such as your husband.

63
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,659
But I think perhaps Tom
was the bravest man I've ever met.

64
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,819
We have a saying in Indiana:

65
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,699
"The braver the bird, the fatter the cat."

66
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,339
Perhaps.

67
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,340
Do you recognize this photograph, General?

68
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,300
Of course. It was his last.

69
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,220
Do you remember how Tom got that shot?

70
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,300
We were together.

71
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,780
I must confess, my eyes weren't on him
when he snapped the shutter.

72
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,740
The aircraft came in low.
We were both in the truck.

73
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,341
I jumped down on one side to take cover,
and Tom jumped down on the other side.

74
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:15,581
Tom couldn't have taken cover
and photographed the plane as he did.

75
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:19,021
I dare say you're right.
He had a strong sense of duty.

76
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:22,261
He also had a strong sense of death.

77
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:26,741
I felt I had to confirm what I suspected
about the last photograph.

78
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:28,982
I'm very grateful to you.

79
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,982
That's over a year ago.
How have you been occupying yourself?

80
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,942
- After I lost the child I was...
- The child?

81
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:40,302
Didn't Tom tell you we had a child on the way?

82
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:45,383
Men like Tom are often quite reticent
about things that are nearest to their hearts.

83
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:47,503
I understand.

84
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:51,223
It was quite late in my pregnancy
when Tom was killed.

85
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:53,903
Apparently the Palestine trip was too much.

86
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,863
I lost the baby in the hospital at Jerusalem.

87
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:01,224
And then I went back
to my old profession of nursing.

88
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:05,104
I've just completed my tour of duty
with the US Public Health Service in Greece.

89
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:08,064
Very good. What are your plans for the future?

90
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:13,064
I haven't quite decided yet.
I may travel a while before I go home.

91
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:17,785
I have passage booked on a freighter
that sails next week to Istanbul.

92
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:20,105
From there I may go to Lydia.

93
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:23,185
I've always wanted to see the Vale of Kashmir.

94
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:26,025
It's probably the most beautiful spot on earth.

95
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:28,465
Mrs. Fremont, may I introduce Maj. Caldwell?

96
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,065
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

97
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:32,025
- Have a drink.
- Thank you. I'd love one.

98
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:35,426
- How did your disembarkation go?
- Smoothly.

99
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:37,786
We're really up to our neck in Jews, sir.

100
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:40,866
Karaolos bursting at the seams
and more to come.

101
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:44,266
I still say we should send them back
where they came from.

102
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:46,906
Two loads were shipped out of Haifa
bound for Hamburg.

103
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:48,946
I don't see why we can't do the same thing.

104
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,027
I shouldn't like to have a hand
in sending a Jew back to Germany.

105
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:53,947
Squeeze them in as best as you can.

106
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,747
They're squeezed in.
Short of bed space, supplies...

107
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:59,787
short of nurses, short of temper,
short of everything.

108
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:01,667
Mrs. Fremont's a nurse.

109
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:04,387
Why don't you lend a hand at Karaolos?

110
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,548
No, General. I'm afraid I couldn't.

111
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:10,788
I've really been quite tired lately.

112
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:13,308
And I don't know anything about them.

113
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:14,748
About the Jews?

114
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,348
I feel strange among them.

115
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,828
In what way?

116
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:21,188
Now that you mention it, I can't think.

117
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:23,229
It's just a feeling I get.

118
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:27,069
- Will you have another drink?
- Thank you, no. I really must leave.

119
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:30,029
I'm touring the island
and my guide is very firm with me.

120
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,349
- I’ll take you to your car.
- Thank you for the drink and the talk.

121
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:35,469
Drive by Karaolos on your tour.

122
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,070
Ring me if there's anything I can do
to make your stay more comfortable.

123
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,310
I will.

124
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,551
I'm very fond of the old man. One of the best.

125
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:58,351
Makes it all the more difficult
to explain his little quirk.

126
00:11:58,471 --> 00:11:59,471
Quirk?

127
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:02,591
About the Jews.
You caught it all right. I was watching.

128
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,591
Almost makes one believe the story
one hears now and then.

129
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,311
Probably nonsense, but still...

130
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:09,471
What story?

131
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:14,032
That if you gave a good shake to his family tree,
you'd find a Jew up there.

132
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:24,352
Please tell Gen. Sutherland
I've changed my mind.

133
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:27,193
I’ll be happy to work at Karaolos for a few days.

134
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,113
- Goodbye, Major.
- Goodbye.

135
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,957
- Do you need any help?
- No, thanks.

136
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:46,637
- Good night, then.
- Good night, and thanks for stopping.

137
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,239
Ari! Ari Ben Canaan!

138
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:12,519
- Reuben. How are you?
- Fine.

139
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,639
The car's up there.

140
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,199
Good. We'll go directly to Mandria.

141
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:21,400
We can't, Ari.
He's on the other side of the island.

142
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,680
- He won't be back until tomorrow.
- He should be on this side of the island.

143
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:55,602
British checkpoint, Jewish checkpoint.

144
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,442
We don't allow our military personnel
in the camp area...

145
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:00,642
unless something extraordinary occurs.

146
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:03,642
We handle the outside. The inside's up to them.

147
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:07,682
- Lieutenant, this is Katherine Fremont.
- How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?

148
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:10,723
American. Authority Gen. Sutherland.
Pass her at all times.

149
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,923
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you.

150
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:21,683
These Zionist organizations,
or whatever they call them...

151
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:25,483
send their own people over from Palestine
to administer these camps.

152
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:28,484
Jews seem to respond better to their own kind.

153
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:30,124
Perhaps we all do.

154
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:34,244
We even give them the privilege
of approving all Gentile personnel.

155
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:37,084
- I hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

156
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,245
- Good morning, Ben Ami.
- Good morning, sir.

157
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:48,165
This is Mrs. Fremont,
an American friend of Gen. Sutherland.

158
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,965
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

159
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:52,685
Ben Ami is one of the Palestinians
who run this camp.

160
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:57,445
Mrs. Fremont has a few days to while away
in Cyprus, and being an experienced nurse...

161
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,326
the general thought you may find
her assistance valuable.

162
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:03,366
We find all assistance of value, Maj. Caldwell.

163
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:06,646
- Would you show him your passport?
- Of course.

164
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:10,926
Any friend of Gen. Sutherland's
is always welcome.

165
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:13,806
Convey my respects to the general,
and thank him for us.

166
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:18,087
Of course. Goodbye. Good luck.

167
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,367
- Call us if you need us.
- Thank you.

168
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,447
- Would you care to come with me?
- Surely.

169
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:25,407
Yesterday's shipload
will double our hospital capacity.

170
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,447
It's very good of you to help us get organized.

171
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,371
- Leave me alone.
- You're burning up with fever.

172
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:26,211
If you don't let us clean out the infection
you'll die, that's all.

173
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:30,371
After coming so far,
you'll die without ever having seen Eretz Israel.

174
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:33,531
I’ll see Palestine before you. Now leave me alone.

175
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,811
This woman is trying to help you.

176
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,852
- Do as she says.
- Who are you?

177
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:40,212
He's the Palestinian commander, that's who.

178
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:42,732
A Jewish policeman, working for them.

179
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:44,772
I know your kind from Auschwitz.

180
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,452
- You can't tell me what to do.
- We'll see.

181
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,852
- I’ll hold him.
- Just try.

182
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:54,933
Dov! If you don't let them help you, you'll die.

183
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,213
I want to die.

184
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,373
You don't know what you're saying.
I’ll take them off myself. It won't hurt.

185
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,893
Keep away from me, all of you.

186
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:07,453
Excuse me.

187
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:12,574
I think I can talk to him better if we're alone.

188
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:17,174
We came on the Star of David together,
and I know him. He's just shy.

189
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:20,414
Don't get too close to the glass.

190
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,135
Dov Landau, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself. Put that down.

191
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:33,415
I won't.

192
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:35,015
That hurt.

193
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:39,015
Not half as bad as it will hurt.
I’ll teach you. I’ll beat you all over.

194
00:18:39,255 --> 00:18:42,095
Well? Do you let them take care of you or not?

195
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:48,776
Not them. But if you want to do it, well, all right.

196
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:51,976
Thank you.

197
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:57,496
And don't you ever spit on me again.
Just remember.

198
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:04,857
- It's all right, I’ll do it.
- How did you change his mind?

199
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,177
Just patience and kindness.

200
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:13,177
Yetta will show you around.
Don't hesitate to call on me if I can help.

201
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:14,537
Thank you.

202
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,378
Now, this is pavilion number two.

203
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:25,578
Excuse me.

204
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:27,938
This boy has a skin infection called impetigo.

205
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:31,418
- He needs sulfathiazole on those scabs.
- If the camp has no such drug?

206
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,099
Leave him alone.
That will spread it all over his body.

207
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:36,779
- You think so?
- I know it. It's terribly contagious.

208
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:39,779
My dear, it's this way.
If you have no sulfathiazole...

209
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:42,059
and no ammoniated mercury ointment...

210
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,219
which was the earlier pharmacology,
you soften the scab with soap and water...

211
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:49,540
and gently remove it like this, you see?

212
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,980
Then expose the lesion
for five minutes to the sun.

213
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,020
That's also a cure.

214
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,540
- You're a doctor.
- By coincidence.

215
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,460
It was stupid of me to interfere.

216
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,301
I'm a nurse. I’ll be working here for a while.
Please forgive me.

217
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:08,301
Dr. Odenheim, it's time for you to rest.

218
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,181
You've been up all night. I know how to do this.

219
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:14,661
- He taught me on the ship.
- Thank you, child of light.

220
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:18,861
I’ll find you something to wear over your dress,
a gown or an apron.

221
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,301
Thank you.

222
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,782
My name is Katherine Fremont. I'm a nurse.

223
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:29,422
- You can call me Kitty.
- My name's Karen Hansen.

224
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:30,942
Hansen?

225
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,582
- Then your mother was Jewish?
- Yes, and my father.

226
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:02,664
- Reuben.
- Shalom, Ari.

227
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:05,064
- David, how are you?
- Shalom, Ari.

228
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:08,784
- Mr. Mandria, this is Ari Ben Canaan.
- Welcome.

229
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:13,025
Very pleased to meet you.
We've heard good things about you in Palestine.

230
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:15,585
- Rumours. But I like them.
- So do we.

231
00:21:15,785 --> 00:21:17,345
Please sit down.

232
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:19,985
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.

233
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:23,505
Well, David,
how many people have you got by now...

234
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,665
in that barbed wire jungle of yours?

235
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,186
Over 30,000.

236
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:30,386
And they're building for 30,000 more
on the other side of the island.

237
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:32,826
How many arrived yesterday
on the Star of David?

238
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,306
Six hundred and eleven.

239
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:38,546
We're going to take the same 611 off the island
and land them in Palestine.

240
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:42,667
- Six hundred and eleven?
- He thinks he's Moses.

241
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:47,027
We haven't been able to break
more than 10 or 15 at a time out of Karaolos.

242
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:50,307
This will be a new experience.
One thing more. There's a time limit.

243
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:53,387
Today is Tuesday.
We'll stage the break next Monday.

244
00:21:53,507 --> 00:21:55,867
- Next Monday?
- Why not tomorrow?

245
00:21:56,507 --> 00:21:57,907
Ari, we cannot do it.

246
00:21:58,027 --> 00:22:00,548
The United Nations
will vote on the Palestine issue...

247
00:22:00,668 --> 00:22:02,068
before the end of this session.

248
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,748
Between now and then
we have to show the world...

249
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:06,828
thousands of homeless European Jews...

250
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:10,108
are not going to accept any solution
that bars them from Palestine.

251
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:14,148
A mass escape of the very same people
who arrived on the Star of David...

252
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:16,189
is worth more than a million speeches.

253
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:18,949
But this isn't the Red Sea, Ari.
It's the Mediterranean.

254
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:22,469
Right. Smite these waters as you will,
they do not part.

255
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:25,109
That's why you'll have to get us a ship.

256
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:26,709
I want a legitimate freighter...

257
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:29,869
with legal registry and real cargo
we can unload here in Cyprus.

258
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:31,550
A ship for six...

259
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,190
That's a wonderful idea.

260
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,550
Brilliant.

261
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,750
But the expense will be brilliant also.

262
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,870
Not too brilliant.

263
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,991
You know, our treasury is based on donations,
and right now we're rather low.

264
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:55,151
- Well, can you deliver or not?
- I’ll do my best.

265
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:59,671
We Cypriots are with you.
For the Jews, Mandria will do everything.

266
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:03,191
The Jews have paid you well for your efforts,
Mr. Mandria.

267
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:06,992
- Ari, you've got to understand...
- No, Reuben. I say it.

268
00:23:09,392 --> 00:23:13,032
Do you believe that I, Plato Mandria,
would do this for money?

269
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,232
Do you think I'd risk
10 years in prison for money?

270
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:21,713
I tell you, it has cost me over £5,000
since I work with the Haganah.

271
00:23:22,113 --> 00:23:24,113
You owe him an apology, Ari.

272
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,953
I do apologize, Mr. Mandria.
It was a stupid remark.

273
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:30,153
Not necessary.

274
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:34,473
If I apologize each time I get stupid,
I'd spend a lifetime on my knees.

275
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,554
- Also, we'll need 14 lorries.
- 14, he says. Why not 1,400?

276
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:42,474
The British have requisitioned every car,
truck and lorry on this island.

277
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:45,714
Haganah makes mistakes just like anybody else.
This is one of them.

278
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:50,354
David, I want to hear every objection,
every criticism, every suggestion, but only once.

279
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:54,635
- Now the boat project is under way, right?
- Almost accomplished.

280
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:57,155
I will send a telegram to a shipbroker in Athens.

281
00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:59,755
- Don't the British monitor telegrams?
- Naturally.

282
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,955
But some of the monitors are Cypriots.

283
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:04,875
They'd like the Britons in Britain,
the Jews in Palestine...

284
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:08,795
and the Cypriots in Cyprus.
Not, mind you, that I'm anti-British.

285
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,436
If I must have a master,
the British are far the best.

286
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:14,956
But the problem, my dear friend, is,
why have a master at all?

287
00:24:20,356 --> 00:24:23,356
Shouldn't have hurt him, Ari. He's a real friend.

288
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:26,637
Maybe, but don't let the Mandrias fool you.

289
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,197
They work for us and say how terrible it was...

290
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:31,397
that 6,000,000 Jews went into the oven.

291
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:33,997
But when the showdown comes,
we always stand alone.

292
00:24:34,117 --> 00:24:36,037
Mandria will sell us out like all the others.

293
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:39,277
We have no friends, except ourselves.
Remember that.

294
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:42,038
You're wrong,
but you'll have to learn that for yourself.

295
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:44,158
Now tell me, how is Jordana?

296
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:46,558
I think she's in love.

297
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:49,678
You've had this letter since last night...

298
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:51,118
I forgot about it.

299
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:53,518
He's in love with her, so he thinks everyone is.

300
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:54,958
He's right.

301
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:58,599
She mention me in there?

302
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,519
Thank you.

303
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:10,639
- No, thank you.
- None for me.

304
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,079
How did you know I postponed my departure?

305
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:18,000
Central Intelligence has a great talent
for spying on the innocent.

306
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,880
It'll interest them to learn
that I have a plot under way.

307
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,320
Good. Can you tell me about it?

308
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,640
There's a child at the camp
I'd like to take out for a holiday.

309
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,560
Just for luncheon,
and perhaps to buy her some clothes.

310
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,841
Then I take it
some of the strangeness has worn off?

311
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:35,921
I know it was foolish to say that.

312
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:39,201
But I can't help it. I do feel strange among them.

313
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:43,601
Except for this girl.
Somehow she's entirely different.

314
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:46,281
Her point of view, the way she works...

315
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:49,602
she acts, feels and speaks
almost exactly like an American.

316
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:51,922
I can think of no higher praise.

317
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:55,202
You're laughing at me, and I deserve it.

318
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:58,242
I'm not laughing. I'm simply glad it worked.

319
00:25:58,402 --> 00:26:00,402
- What?
- I wanted you to get interested...

320
00:26:00,522 --> 00:26:03,723
in something
beside your own troubles, and you did.

321
00:26:04,283 --> 00:26:06,723
It's interesting that you saw it so fast.

322
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:10,803
- Of course, you were absolutely right.
- I'm glad you weren't offended.

323
00:26:10,923 --> 00:26:12,723
I shouldn't like you to become a woman...

324
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:15,443
who drifts through life, "fair to no purpose...

325
00:26:15,563 --> 00:26:20,284
"...artful to no end,
young without lovers, old without a friend."

326
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:23,124
Do you have a solution?

327
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:27,204
If I were 20 years younger
I'd offer myself as a solution.

328
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:30,484
The Vale of Kashmir is no good
unless you share it with someone.

329
00:26:30,604 --> 00:26:33,804
Places don't mean anything.
Only people are important.

330
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:38,365
Fill your life with people.
Let Tom return to the grave where he belongs.

331
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:40,885
Fred!

332
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,285
- Yes, sir?
- There's a child out at Karaolos...

333
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:46,965
Mrs. Fremont would like released for a day.

334
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:48,605
What's her name?

335
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:50,205
Karen Hansen.

336
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:53,046
- See to it for me, will you?
- Very well, sir.

337
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:56,886
- Isn't it a little irregular?
- Extremely.

338
00:26:57,006 --> 00:27:00,726
That's why I want your signature on the pass
instead of my own.

339
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:02,206
Yes, sir.

340
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:04,646
Thank you.

341
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:33,168
Isn't she a beauty?

342
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:35,768
You must have towed it across.

343
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,928
All right, she's no beauty,
but her heart is solid oak. You'll see.

344
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:40,008
Ari!

345
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:42,969
Hank, how are you?
Hank Schlosberg from Cincinnati.

346
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:45,489
He's run more ships through the blockade
than anyone.

347
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,409
This is Mr. Mandria, who arranged for this tub.

348
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,289
- Not a bad ship.
- Not a good one, Mr. Mandria.

349
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:54,329
For the money we pay,
every ship cannot be the Queen Mary.

350
00:27:54,449 --> 00:27:56,129
Can this abortion make it to Palestine?

351
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:58,810
On my mother's honour, she has made 300 trips...

352
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,130
from Cyprus to Turkey under her last owner.

353
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,290
That's just the trouble.
We can hold her together for one more round.

354
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,250
I want a loudspeaker system aboard.

355
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,210
Get me a power unit
and six Almec-Thorston speakers.

356
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,490
There is no such equipment for sale in Cyprus.

357
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,251
If you can't buy it, steal it.
Stock it with provisions for five days.

358
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:18,011
- For a two-day trip?
- Five days.

359
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,411
All prepared foods, either canned or packaged.

360
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:22,171
The most expensive, naturally.

361
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:25,651
- Have you got my jeep yet?
- I told you, it's impossible.

362
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,451
A jeep is out of the question, absolutely.

363
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:33,012
- Need someone to overhaul the engine tank?
- No, my gang can take care of that.

364
00:28:33,132 --> 00:28:34,692
- Mr. Mandria?
- Yes?

365
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:38,252
What about that jeep there?

366
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:41,452
That belongs to His Beatitude...

367
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:44,092
the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Cyprus.

368
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:49,733
Steal it. Paint it. Hide it till I'm ready for it.

369
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:07,774
The water's wonderful.
May I have another swim before my steak?

370
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:10,774
Just once more,
because we're due back at the camp.

371
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:13,414
- Is that the girl?
- Yes.

372
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:16,654
Swims just like an American.

373
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:21,815
- I’ll buy you a drink if you'll forget that joke.
- I just had one.

374
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:23,215
She is nice.

375
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:28,575
Would it be too difficult to arrange
for me to take her back to America?

376
00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:31,455
Not from our end.
We'd be glad to let them all go.

377
00:29:31,575 --> 00:29:33,775
So long as they don't end up in Palestine.

378
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:38,016
Let me know when you've decided.
I’ll get Maj. Caldwell to arrange it for you.

379
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:39,376
Thank you.

380
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:43,296
Karen.

381
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:45,976
Coming.

382
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:59,537
Would you like to go to America?

383
00:29:59,937 --> 00:30:03,057
Of course. Everybody likes to go to America.

384
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,577
Then you will go.

385
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:08,858
I’ll cancel the rest of my trip,
and I’ll take you with me.

386
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:11,898
And you can go to school there,
and later on to the university.

387
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,898
And if you like it, and want to,
you can become an American citizen.

388
00:30:16,018 --> 00:30:17,898
You mean, go right away?

389
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:20,378
Perhaps. In the next week or two.

390
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:22,938
Meanwhile, I may be able to get you out of camp.

391
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:25,339
I’ll speak to the general tonight.

392
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,699
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

393
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:32,459
You do want to go, don't you?

394
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:34,259
Yes, but I mean...

395
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:37,499
I must think about it a little.

396
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:41,300
- What is there to think about?
- I don't know.

397
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,500
But it's so important, and I need a little time.

398
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,900
You know, to think.

399
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,900
Take all the time you wish.

400
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,700
- Kitty?
- Yes?

401
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,661
- Don't be mad at me.
- Of course not.

402
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:05,461
It's getting late. You better finish your steak.

403
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:17,542
Fine thing, what you want to do for Karen.

404
00:31:18,102 --> 00:31:19,502
She told you?

405
00:31:20,382 --> 00:31:22,582
She is worried about her father.

406
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:26,182
I didn't know that her father was alive.

407
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,863
When Karen was six,
he smuggled her out of Germany to Denmark.

408
00:31:30,343 --> 00:31:33,343
After the war she went back to find her parents.

409
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:36,223
The Jewish Agency had records of the dead.

410
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:38,423
She found her mother on the Dachau list...

411
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:40,743
together with her two younger brothers.

412
00:31:40,863 --> 00:31:44,583
About the father there was nothing,
so naturally she hopes he is still alive.

413
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:48,464
Maybe in Palestine.
As a matter of fact, there is such a possibility.

414
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:52,224
He was a very important scientist.
The Nazis could have spared his life...

415
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:55,664
in order to use his brain.
But of course, who knows?

416
00:31:57,464 --> 00:32:00,464
It's curious
that she didn't mention her father to me.

417
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:02,985
You must understand something
about these children.

418
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:05,945
Their past is scarred. They're ashamed of it.

419
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:10,785
To have a parent who has been persecuted,
or killed in a concentration camp...

420
00:32:10,905 --> 00:32:14,745
is a reproach to them.
They feel guilty for having survived.

421
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:17,865
So they pretend the bad things never happened.

422
00:32:18,826 --> 00:32:21,826
To take such a child is a great responsibility...

423
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:25,666
- even a sacrifice.
- It's no sacrifice.

424
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,866
I'm alone. The insurance I got
after my husband's death is more than enough.

425
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:34,146
I didn't mean financial sacrifice,
although it's a good thing to have money.

426
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:38,707
No, what I meant was,
you will have to make a sacrifice of yourself.

427
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:41,267
These children who have lost everything...

428
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:43,867
spend their lives searching for new parents.

429
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:48,347
Their need reaches out to your heart
as naturally as a flower turns to the sun.

430
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,827
And they trap you.

431
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:54,428
Because they've been so long without love,
they demand all the love you have.

432
00:32:54,788 --> 00:32:57,908
Karen will drain you of love. She'll exhaust you.

433
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:01,748
That's exactly what I need.

434
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:09,829
I'd like to go with you, Kitty.

435
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:12,389
If you still want me.

436
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,073
- Morning.
- Morning.

437
00:33:50,193 --> 00:33:53,113
- Bowen, 23rd GT Company.
- What can I do for you, sir?

438
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,833
Afraid I’ll to have to draw rather heavily on you.

439
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:58,154
- Please have a chair.
- Thank you.

440
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:02,994
This does draw us down a bit.
Excuse me a moment.

441
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:05,354
- Operator.
- CO, please.

442
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:07,354
Won't take a minute.

443
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:09,794
I hope not. As you can see, I'm in a hurry.

444
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,634
- CO speaking.
- Hall here, sir.

445
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:16,475
I've an order at transport pool, sir, for 14 lorries...

446
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:20,235
4 motorcycles, 18 drivers and 18 guards.

447
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,475
Estimated use four hours, sir.

448
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:24,995
- What's this for?
- Transport from Karaolos, sir.

449
00:34:25,115 --> 00:34:27,035
- Who is requesting this?
- Capt. Bowen.

450
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:30,476
- What authority?
- Sir Cecil Bradshaw, of the Colonial office.

451
00:34:30,596 --> 00:34:32,836
- Yes.
- Countersigned Lt. Gen. Sutherland.

452
00:34:32,956 --> 00:34:35,636
- Well, allocate it then.
- Yes, of course, sir.

453
00:34:35,756 --> 00:34:37,916
- What's the query?
- I thought you might want...

454
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,996
to draw extra transport from headquarters.

455
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:42,716
- Don't babble on, man. Give it to him.
- Yes, sir.

456
00:34:42,836 --> 00:34:44,356
And get on with it.

457
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:45,797
Very good, sir.

458
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,197
Smithers. Take this and get it filled at once.

459
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:51,997
- Yes, sir.
- We'll have you taken care of in a jiff.

460
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:53,997
Can I order tea for you?

461
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:57,477
Rather prefer a gin and tonic, if you don't mind.

462
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:21,639
- Bowen, 23rd transport company.
- Lt. Arnold, sir.

463
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:23,759
I want to see the Palestinian camp commander.

464
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,519
Right this way, sir.

465
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,720
This is the Palestinian commander,
David Ben Ami.

466
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,440
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

467
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,040
We are relocating all the internees
from the Star of David.

468
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,840
Here are your orders.

469
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,400
Where are you taking these people?

470
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,881
Their destination is not included
in your orders, Mr...

471
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:56,321
- Ben Ami.
- Yes. Thank you.

472
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:59,201
These people have not recovered
from their last journey.

473
00:35:59,321 --> 00:36:03,841
I cannot permit them to travel again so soon,
just because of a piece of paper.

474
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:06,441
Piece of paper?

475
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:11,602
- This seems perfectly clear to me.
- Sir, some of these people are sick.

476
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:13,842
You will turn the internees over at once.

477
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:16,402
I'm sorry. I just cannot accept that responsibility.

478
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,562
I’ll take the responsibility.

479
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:28,323
- There, does that satisfy you?
- Of course, I don't approve, but...

480
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:30,883
I guess it makes the record perfect.

481
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:33,723
Would you order him
to place all his Palestinian...

482
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:36,483
administrative personnel at my disposal
while loading?

483
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:38,403
- Did you hear?
- Yes, sir.

484
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:41,484
You can call on me
if you run into any trouble, sir.

485
00:36:41,604 --> 00:36:43,164
Thanks, old chap.

486
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:45,844
Well, let's get about it.

487
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:49,684
Attention.

488
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:55,124
All passengers from the Star of David,
listen carefully.

489
00:36:56,565 --> 00:36:59,965
We have received orders
to evacuate you immediately.

490
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:04,645
I repeat. All those who arrived
on the Star of David...

491
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:07,485
are to be evacuated at once.

492
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:12,005
Please prepare to board the British lorries
now passing through the camp.

493
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:15,886
Report at once
to your nearest Palestinian guard point.

494
00:37:26,406 --> 00:37:29,247
What does this mean? HMJFC?

495
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:33,367
His Majesty's Jewish Forces on Cyprus,
what else?

496
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:06,849
- What's going on?
- Military police.

497
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:09,569
They're blocking the intersection
for through traffic.

498
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:11,129
I don't understand.

499
00:38:11,729 --> 00:38:13,889
Go and find the commanding officer, will you?

500
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:17,129
I'd better look into this myself.
Excuse me, Mrs. Fremont.

501
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,810
Stay here.

502
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,890
- Sergeant, clear the way for my car.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:40,971
I'm afraid this is most unusual.

504
00:38:41,091 --> 00:38:43,331
We've had no warning.
I’ll check with headquarters.

505
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:44,971
These orders are perfectly clear.

506
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:48,491
Signed by the Colonial Office
and countersigned by Gen. Sutherland.

507
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:50,412
What's this? The whole area's tied up.

508
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:51,692
- Who's in charge?
- O'Hara.

509
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:53,572
Permit me. Bowen, 23rd GT Company.

510
00:38:53,692 --> 00:38:55,692
Special detail, orders of Gen. Sutherland.

511
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:57,612
Here are the papers, sir.

512
00:39:00,052 --> 00:39:03,732
Well, Bowen, I see you're going to be
getting rid of some Jews for us?

513
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:07,053
- Yes, sir. Shipping them back to Hamburg.
- That's where they belong.

514
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:09,493
It's a German matter. Let the Germans handle it.

515
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,973
Apparently the general's had second thoughts.

516
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:13,733
Why do you question these orders?

517
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,533
I didn't question.
I just wanted to check with headquarters.

518
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:19,533
Countersigning is not the responsibility
of junior officers.

519
00:39:19,653 --> 00:39:21,933
The acceptance of responsibility...

520
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:24,894
is what makes senior officers out of juniors.

521
00:39:26,934 --> 00:39:29,014
- Let them through.
- Yes, sir.

522
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:31,694
Should have started this policy two years ago.

523
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:34,574
I don't care about the Jews one way or the other.

524
00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:37,454
- But they are troublemakers.
- No question about it, sir.

525
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,855
Get two of them together, you've got a debate...

526
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:41,335
and three, a revolution.

527
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:43,415
Yes. And half of them are Communists anyway.

528
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:45,895
Yes, and the other half pawnbrokers.

529
00:39:46,335 --> 00:39:49,735
They look funny, too. I can spot one a mile away.

530
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:54,735
Would you mind looking into my eye?
It feels like a cinder.

531
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:56,056
Certainly.

532
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:02,336
You know, a lot of them
try to hide under Gentile names.

533
00:40:03,816 --> 00:40:06,576
But one look at that face, and you just know.

534
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:09,016
With a little experience, you can smell them out.

535
00:40:09,136 --> 00:40:12,817
- I'm sorry, I can't find a thing.
- Must've been my imagination. Thanks.

536
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:25,857
Maj. Caldwell, are they taking everybody
who was on the Star of David?

537
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:30,258
- Yes, ma'am, we are.
- Then Karen's on one of those trucks.

538
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:31,418
Karen?

539
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:32,978
Karen Hansen.

540
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,858
I have Gen. Sutherland's permission
to take her to America.

541
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:39,058
- We were on our way to pick up the girl.
- How old is she?

542
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:41,498
Fourteen. She was assigned to the hospital.

543
00:40:42,698 --> 00:40:44,178
Yes, it seems to me...

544
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:45,859
Is that the girl that the...

545
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:48,939
forgot his name, the camp commander,
was talking about?

546
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,059
David Ben Ami? Yes.
He knew she was supposed go with me.

547
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:55,259
I remember. He told me
the general had made arrangements for her...

548
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:57,659
so I left her behind, on my own responsibility.

549
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:00,339
- Very good, Bowen.
- Thank you very much.

550
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,660
I appreciate your help.
Convey my respects to the general.

551
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,020
That I will.

552
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,500
- Bit of a Jew himself, you know.
- Not really?

553
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,060
Good luck, sir.

554
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:42,902
Remember, I've been in Palestine.

555
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:45,462
I know what kind of life she'll live, if she lives.

556
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:46,782
I grant you that.

557
00:41:46,902 --> 00:41:50,463
Besides, she must have been forced,
otherwise she would've left a note.

558
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,423
We'll get her back for you, one way or another.

559
00:41:54,503 --> 00:41:56,503
With her consent, of course.

560
00:41:59,223 --> 00:42:01,663
Who was in charge of this evacuation?

561
00:42:01,943 --> 00:42:04,183
Chap named Bowen, sir. Capt. Bowen.

562
00:42:04,303 --> 00:42:06,624
- What did he look like?
- Look like?

563
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,064
A well set up sort of chap.

564
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:11,584
Proper bearing, decent decorations.

565
00:42:13,424 --> 00:42:14,944
Spoke like any of us.

566
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:18,424
- From what command?
- 23rd GT Company, sir.

567
00:42:20,064 --> 00:42:22,424
- Is anything irregular?
- Could be.

568
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,425
We don't list a 23rd GT Company on Cyprus.

569
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:27,945
You should have known that.

570
00:42:29,265 --> 00:42:30,665
Yes, I should.

571
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:34,585
- Perhaps I made an error.
- It's human.

572
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,545
Who issued Capt. Bowen's orders?

573
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:41,266
They originated with Bradshaw
of the Colonial Office.

574
00:42:41,386 --> 00:42:42,666
And, of course, you signed them.

575
00:42:42,786 --> 00:42:46,906
- You examined the signatures?
- Well, naturally, and I countersigned.

576
00:42:47,026 --> 00:42:48,426
I signed no such order.

577
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:51,786
Neither have I seen such an order
from the Colonial Office.

578
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:56,507
Well, those signatures must've been forged?

579
00:42:57,827 --> 00:43:01,547
We can't exclude the possibility.
With one exception, of course.

580
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:06,027
- Your signature was genuine, wasn't it?
- Someone had to take responsibility, sir.

581
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:08,787
And you took it. Now you've got it.

582
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:11,467
What do you propose to do with it?

583
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:15,828
That boat...

584
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:18,628
That Olympia...

585
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:22,508
She's not going to Hamburg.
She's probably heading for Palestine.

586
00:43:22,628 --> 00:43:23,948
Undoubtedly.

587
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:27,028
Telephone control, tell them to block the harbour.

588
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:29,309
Take a look at the situation yourself.

589
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:30,829
Very well, sir.

590
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:34,509
Mrs. Fremont. Sir.

591
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,270
Let me have the microphone.

592
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,110
Attention, Olympia. Attention, out there.

593
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,190
This is Maj. Caldwell speaking.

594
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,110
Attention, Olympia.

595
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,031
You have no chance to escape.

596
00:44:02,311 --> 00:44:06,071
The destroyer Zebra is moving into position
to block the harbour entrance.

597
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:09,111
Return to dock.

598
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:11,791
Otherwise we will board you.

599
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:17,632
We're bound for Palestine
with an American captain and crew...

600
00:44:17,752 --> 00:44:20,192
and a passenger manifest of 611 persons.

601
00:44:20,312 --> 00:44:24,032
We're carrying 200 pounds of dynamite
in the engine room with fuses attached.

602
00:44:24,152 --> 00:44:27,712
You let one British soldier step aboard
this ship and we'll blow her up.

603
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,712
Have you heard me, Major?

604
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:31,752
Message received.

605
00:44:33,273 --> 00:44:35,953
Where would they find 200 pounds of dynamite?

606
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,833
- Get me Gen. Sutherland.
- Operator.

607
00:44:38,953 --> 00:44:41,873
- Connect me to Gen. Sutherland.
- Yes, sir.

608
00:44:42,873 --> 00:44:45,673
In an ammunition dump, you blithering idiot.

609
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,873
- Sutherland here.
- Caldwell here, sir.

610
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:53,834
The Olympia threatens to blow herself
out of the water, sir, if we board her.

611
00:44:54,394 --> 00:44:57,594
I'm convinced it's a bluff, of course.
Boarding party en route, sir.

612
00:44:58,074 --> 00:44:59,954
Call your boarding party back.

613
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:03,354
Signal the Olympia.
I'm asking London for instructions.

614
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:06,995
If she stays where she is, no one will molest her.

615
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:15,755
They've threatened to dynamite
the Olympia if we board her.

616
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:18,035
Do you think they mean it?

617
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:22,756
Nearly two years ago, a Haganah ship
which we were detaining in the port of Haifa...

618
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:26,516
did blow herself up. 236 refugees died.

619
00:45:27,396 --> 00:45:30,276
General, I simply must get Karen off the ship.

620
00:45:30,676 --> 00:45:33,116
Would you care to go on board the Olympia...

621
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:35,476
and learn from the child
exactly what happened?

622
00:45:35,596 --> 00:45:38,236
- Will they let me?
- I’ll try and arrange it.

623
00:45:38,356 --> 00:45:41,317
If I succeed, you can do me a favour in return.

624
00:45:41,437 --> 00:45:42,557
I’ll do anything.

625
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:47,437
If force, or coercion of any kind,
was used to get that child on board the ship...

626
00:45:47,637 --> 00:45:50,597
you must promise me to tell the entire story...

627
00:45:50,717 --> 00:45:53,317
at a press conference which I shall arrange.

628
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:55,558
- Do you agree?
- I’ll be glad to.

629
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:00,078
Reuben?

630
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:03,758
Send this every 10 minutes,
and keep on sending it.

631
00:46:04,718 --> 00:46:06,598
- Could we interrupt, please?
- Yes.

632
00:46:06,718 --> 00:46:10,278
This is Dr. de Vries. We elevated ourselves
into a medical committee.

633
00:46:10,398 --> 00:46:11,319
Good.

634
00:46:11,439 --> 00:46:15,519
It's our opinion the sanitary arrangements
on this ship are hopelessly inadequate.

635
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:19,119
Unless we make
some additional bathing and toilet facilities...

636
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,159
we'll have a serious health problem.

637
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,079
All right, we'll try to take care of it.

638
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:26,719
There he is. This is Mrs. Fremont,
from Gen. Sutherland.

639
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:29,160
- How do you do? Hank?
- Yes.

640
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,320
- We have enough scrap lumber to build
privies on deck? - I guess so.

641
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,120
- Ten-holers. Knock some showers
together, too. - Okay.

642
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,200
- Anything else?
- Not for the present, thank you.

643
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,240
This one to Haifa.

644
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,961
You wanted to see me?

645
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:46,441
Yes, Captain.

646
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:49,561
"Yes, Captain." His Majesty's Jewish Brigade.

647
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:53,521
North Africa, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.
The decorations are real.

648
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:56,321
Is that what Sutherland sent you to find out?

649
00:46:56,481 --> 00:47:00,362
You lied to me about the girl.
She's not at the camp, she's on this ship.

650
00:47:00,482 --> 00:47:02,202
And you forced her to come aboard.

651
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:04,962
- We don't force anybody. Tel Aviv yet?
- No.

652
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:06,002
Go on.

653
00:47:06,482 --> 00:47:07,402
You're not listening.

654
00:47:07,522 --> 00:47:10,922
I heard every word you said.
I lied to you about the girl. What else?

655
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:12,602
I'm taking her off this death trap.

656
00:47:12,722 --> 00:47:16,483
Don't tell me what you'll do on this ship.
You'll do exactly what I tell you.

657
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:18,883
- Tel Aviv beginning to send.
- Fine.

658
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,443
How do you know the girl wants to get off?

659
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:24,243
I am trying to save a Jewish child.

660
00:47:24,963 --> 00:47:28,283
Can't you understand that?
Don't you have any respect for human life?

661
00:47:28,523 --> 00:47:31,083
Don't expect me to get hysterical
over one Jewish child...

662
00:47:31,203 --> 00:47:35,964
and don't you get hysterical, either.
You're late, lady. You're 10 years late.

663
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:39,204
Almost 2,000,000 Jewish children,
butchered like animals...

664
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:40,764
because nobody wanted them.

665
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:43,564
No country would have them.
Not your country or any other.

666
00:47:43,684 --> 00:47:46,164
And nobody wants the ones who survived.

667
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:49,365
Jewish flesh is cheap, lady.
It's cheaper than beef.

668
00:47:49,485 --> 00:47:51,245
It is cheaper, even, than herring.

669
00:47:51,365 --> 00:47:53,205
You and your respect...

670
00:47:53,845 --> 00:47:55,565
Tel Aviv complete now.

671
00:47:56,045 --> 00:48:00,805
If you can find the girl, if she wants to go,
take her. Take a dozen if you want to.

672
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:35,487
Kitty!

673
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:41,008
It happened so fast,
I couldn't even leave you a note.

674
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:43,608
I had to go, Kitty, to find my father.

675
00:48:43,728 --> 00:48:47,128
When you asked me to go to America,
I didn't know, and...

676
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:49,728
Kitty, we're going to Palestine.

677
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:52,768
Karen, you don't know what it's like in Palestine.

678
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,089
And the British won't let you go, anyhow.

679
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:57,649
They'll have to, Kitty. They'll just have to.

680
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,769
Because we're not going back to Karaolos,
not ever.

681
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:03,649
Then let me take you to Palestine.
I can find a way.

682
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:05,689
- The man in charge, Mr...
- Ben Canaan?

683
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:06,769
Yes.

684
00:49:06,889 --> 00:49:10,129
If you want to come with me,
you have his permission.

685
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,690
I couldn't leave now, Kitty.

686
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,810
I don't know how to explain it
to someone like you.

687
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:20,890
But we all came here together,
and now we're trying to do something.

688
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,770
And I must stay here, Kitty.

689
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:25,450
Gen. Sutherland calling the Olympia.

690
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:29,451
This is the Exodus. Come in, General.

691
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:33,211
I have received instructions
from the Colonial Office in London.

692
00:49:33,331 --> 00:49:36,131
No attempt will be made to board the Olympia...

693
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:38,731
but the harbour will remain blocked.

694
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,651
You may return to Karaolos whenever you wish.

695
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:44,132
If you choose to remain in the ship...

696
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:47,892
provisions and medical supplies
will be sent to you as you need them.

697
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:49,452
Message completed.

698
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:50,972
Not even now?

699
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:53,332
Kitty...

700
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:54,892
I couldn't.

701
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:58,692
It's like leaving your family when things are bad.

702
00:50:00,493 --> 00:50:01,573
I know.

703
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:04,613
If you want anything, let me know.

704
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,213
Yes. Gen. Sutherland's your friend.

705
00:50:07,613 --> 00:50:09,973
Tell him to let us go to Palestine.

706
00:50:17,734 --> 00:50:21,734
They're just going to turn this ship
into another concentration camp.

707
00:50:24,614 --> 00:50:26,694
Go back? Nonsense.

708
00:50:27,054 --> 00:50:30,374
Did we escape for just ourselves alone? No.

709
00:50:30,734 --> 00:50:34,135
We've done it for hundreds of thousands
of Jews all over Europe...

710
00:50:34,255 --> 00:50:35,575
who couldn't get out.

711
00:50:35,695 --> 00:50:37,775
Also it makes news. World news.

712
00:50:37,895 --> 00:50:40,255
I want your attention for a minute.

713
00:50:40,815 --> 00:50:43,975
Now you all heard Gen. Sutherland
on the loudspeaker.

714
00:50:44,495 --> 00:50:46,535
You must now make a decision.

715
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:48,175
You can go back to Karaolos...

716
00:50:48,335 --> 00:50:51,656
The only way to go back to Karaolos
is by crawling!

717
00:50:52,056 --> 00:50:53,816
or you can stay aboard this ship.

718
00:50:53,936 --> 00:50:56,736
Who are you making the propaganda for?
Them or us?

719
00:50:59,616 --> 00:51:02,856
Quiet, please. There's another possibility.

720
00:51:03,976 --> 00:51:06,497
You were picked by Haganah for this ship...

721
00:51:06,617 --> 00:51:10,057
so that your escape to Palestine
would have some meaning to the world.

722
00:51:10,177 --> 00:51:12,377
If you still want it to have some meaning...

723
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:16,297
if you want to finish what we began,
you can go on a hunger strike.

724
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:19,057
Now you're beginning to make a little sense!

725
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:22,818
We shall tell to the British,
"We spit on your food."

726
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:30,018
And the little food we've got here,
we shall throw overboard.

727
00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:37,378
We are going to Palestine,
or we're going to die right here.

728
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:41,419
Listen, please.

729
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,939
Now just stop and think for a minute.

730
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,659
To go on a hunger strike
is a very serious business...

731
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:50,379
because once you strike...

732
00:51:50,499 --> 00:51:53,339
it can only end when you have won
or when you are dead.

733
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:57,740
What is so unusual about the Jews dying?
Is that anything new?

734
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,140
I stay right here.

735
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,420
There is no excuse for us to go on living...

736
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,020
unless we start fighting right now.

737
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,060
So that every Jew on the face of the earth...

738
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,101
can begin to start feeling
like a human being again.

739
00:52:12,221 --> 00:52:13,861
You heard what I said.

740
00:52:13,981 --> 00:52:15,821
Fight, not beg!

741
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,461
Fight!

742
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:22,581
Wait a minute.

743
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,221
Everybody aboard this ship...

744
00:52:26,341 --> 00:52:28,942
agreed to accept Haganah discipline.

745
00:52:29,422 --> 00:52:31,302
I am now giving an order.

746
00:52:31,742 --> 00:52:33,222
We will sit down...

747
00:52:33,822 --> 00:52:36,422
and we will maintain silence for 20 minutes.

748
00:52:37,302 --> 00:52:39,942
Each one of us will listen to his own heart...

749
00:52:40,062 --> 00:52:41,942
and to his brain, too.

750
00:52:42,582 --> 00:52:44,383
And then we will vote.

751
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:47,503
We will now maintain silence.

752
00:53:02,544 --> 00:53:04,624
I saw the people on that ship.

753
00:53:04,824 --> 00:53:08,224
They're not dangerous.
They're just poor, miserable people.

754
00:53:08,344 --> 00:53:10,264
Why can't you let them go?

755
00:53:10,664 --> 00:53:14,224
You must understand that we British
have shown, throughout our history...

756
00:53:14,344 --> 00:53:17,705
an extraordinary talent
for troublesome commitments.

757
00:53:18,585 --> 00:53:21,585
Palestine is a British mandate imposed upon us...

758
00:53:22,025 --> 00:53:23,745
by the League of Nations...

759
00:53:23,865 --> 00:53:26,865
which makes us responsible
for keeping peace in the area.

760
00:53:26,985 --> 00:53:31,425
The Arabs simply won't keep the peace
if we allow further Jewish immigration.

761
00:53:31,585 --> 00:53:33,546
I don't know much about the mandate.

762
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:37,226
But I do know the Jews
were promised a homeland in Palestine.

763
00:53:37,786 --> 00:53:41,626
During the First World War,
Britain needed and accepted Jewish support...

764
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:43,426
from all over the world.

765
00:53:43,546 --> 00:53:44,826
In return...

766
00:53:44,946 --> 00:53:48,467
the Balfour Declaration of 1917
made such a promise.

767
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:52,027
That promise was reconfirmed
during World War II.

768
00:53:52,307 --> 00:53:55,627
This chap Ben Canaan probably wasn't lying
when he said he fought with us.

769
00:53:55,747 --> 00:53:57,907
Thousands of Palestinians did.

770
00:53:58,227 --> 00:54:01,107
How can you promise something
and then not deliver it?

771
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:05,108
England was fighting for her life in 1917.

772
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:08,588
Nations are very like people
in such circumstances.

773
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:11,908
They make promises
they're not immediately able to fulfil.

774
00:54:12,028 --> 00:54:15,228
During that same crisis,
we made the Arabs certain assurances.

775
00:54:15,348 --> 00:54:17,708
Hence, they have their claims, too.

776
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:21,589
The Arabs are fanatics
on the subject of Jewish immigration.

777
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:24,149
Just now, we need their goodwill.

778
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:27,109
- How is it ever going to end?
- I don't know.

779
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:30,509
The whole question now
is before the United Nations.

780
00:54:30,629 --> 00:54:32,269
I hope they solve it.

781
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:36,189
The sooner I stop operating detention camps,
the happier I’ll be.

782
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:39,630
That goes for every British officer
and soldier I know.

783
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,590
Thank you.

784
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,550
Yes?

785
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,270
The devil.

786
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,110
Of course.

787
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,791
Send a boat alongside at once.
I’ll join you in 10 minutes.

788
00:54:55,551 --> 00:54:58,311
They want to send 23 people back to Karaolos.

789
00:54:58,431 --> 00:55:00,951
The rest have declared a hunger strike.

790
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:07,471
- Can I drop you at your hotel?
- Of course.

791
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:49,834
a few news bulletins, and an announcement.

792
00:55:49,954 --> 00:55:54,074
The evacuation of 2,000 British women
and children from Palestine...

793
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,714
was ordered today by the High Commissioner.

794
00:55:56,914 --> 00:56:01,435
The United Nations Commission on Palestine
still has not submitted its report.

795
00:56:02,035 --> 00:56:03,755
The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem...

796
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:06,555
who sat out the war as Hitler's guest in Berlin...

797
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:10,475
has met in Aley, Lebanon,
with representatives of the Arab nations...

798
00:56:10,595 --> 00:56:13,715
to coordinate action against Palestinian Jews...

799
00:56:13,835 --> 00:56:16,156
in the event Partition is granted.

800
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:20,876
The UN Commission on Palestine
has arrived at Flushing Meadows...

801
00:56:20,996 --> 00:56:24,876
and is now preparing its final
recommendation for the assembly.

802
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:27,076
News of the hunger strike aboard the Exodus...

803
00:56:27,196 --> 00:56:30,476
received front-page treatment
this morning throughout the world.

804
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:34,117
The British embassy in Washington
is already being picketed.

805
00:56:34,997 --> 00:56:38,757
Now Dr. Odenheim has something to say to you
for the medical committee.

806
00:56:38,877 --> 00:56:42,837
It is very important
that we save our supply of fresh water.

807
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:47,197
So we must ration it. Every four hours, one cup.

808
00:56:47,878 --> 00:56:51,078
On the other hand,
everyone must wash his body daily.

809
00:56:51,238 --> 00:56:53,318
This will be done with seawater.

810
00:56:53,438 --> 00:56:56,998
Your platoon leader will call
when your turn comes.

811
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:00,918
It is advised to conserve your energy.

812
00:57:01,478 --> 00:57:05,079
So all necessary physical work
should be divided...

813
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,599
among as many people as possible.

814
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:13,079
If at any time you should feel light-headed
or dizzy, do not be frightened.

815
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:15,319
It is, in no respect, serious.

816
00:57:15,439 --> 00:57:18,999
Just sit down
and lower your head between your knees.

817
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:22,840
All of us, of course, feel stomach pangs.

818
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,440
- They are uncomfortable, but not dangerous.
- That's right.

819
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,840
Final point...

820
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,880
people can live a long time without food,
a very long time.

821
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,160
Attention, everybody.

822
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:41,001
Here is the news,
and some of it, I'm sorry to say, not good.

823
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:45,801
Dov Gruner and three other leaders
of the Irgun in Palestine...

824
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:48,321
were hanged today in Acre prison.

825
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:51,881
The United Nations Commission
on Palestine is still delaying...

826
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,922
its recommendations to the General Assembly.

827
00:57:55,522 --> 00:57:59,002
Winston Churchill has called on
the Labour government to end what he calls...

828
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:02,882
"...this squalid war against the Jews,"
with all possible speed.

829
00:58:03,842 --> 00:58:06,282
- 500 Americans picketed...
- Your water, gentlemen.

830
00:58:06,402 --> 00:58:10,443
UN headquarters in Flushing Meadows,
demanded release...

831
00:58:10,683 --> 00:58:12,643
Your platoon's turn to bathe, Mr. Lakavitch.

832
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:14,683
Your turn to bathe.

833
00:58:15,003 --> 00:58:17,763
Mr. Smolikov, will you please do me a favour?

834
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:22,003
Refresh yourself with my bath,
and then, little bit later, I’ll take yours.

835
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,403
- All right.
- Thank you.

836
00:58:23,523 --> 00:58:25,844
Sorry, Mr. Lakavitch. You know the rules.

837
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:29,164
- Can't you see the position?
- No exceptions.

838
00:58:30,204 --> 00:58:32,764
I think you carry this bathing too far.

839
00:58:33,044 --> 00:58:36,324
- No exceptions, Mr. Lakavitch.
- Fanatics!

840
00:58:37,364 --> 00:58:40,524
establishment of a Jewish state
in the Holy Land.

841
00:58:41,524 --> 00:58:44,485
Thirteen leaders of our
National Committee in Tel Aviv...

842
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:48,045
have begun a hunger strike
in sympathy with the Exodus.

843
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:52,005
When more news comes in, I’ll report it.
That's all.

844
00:58:52,925 --> 00:58:54,485
Have you time for me, Ari?

845
00:58:54,605 --> 00:58:56,845
Always, Dr. Odenheim. What can I do?

846
00:58:56,965 --> 00:58:58,566
We made a mistake...

847
00:58:59,006 --> 00:59:02,446
a bad mistake in letting the children
be a part of this.

848
00:59:02,566 --> 00:59:06,366
A child's body grows every hour.
They need food more than adults.

849
00:59:06,846 --> 00:59:08,966
Their blood requires more sugar.

850
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,886
What should we do about it?

851
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:13,486
When a mistake is made, you admit it...

852
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:16,687
you analyse it, and you correct it.

853
00:59:18,007 --> 00:59:20,047
Doctor, don't you feel well?

854
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:22,647
Who cares if an old man feels well?

855
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:43,850
Major!

856
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:47,331
- Who the devil are you?
- Jorgenson, of the UP.

857
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:49,731
- Thanks, Major.
- All right.

858
01:00:03,211 --> 01:00:05,612
What is this?

859
01:00:05,972 --> 01:00:08,892
- Information, sir.
- Information for whom?

860
01:00:09,532 --> 01:00:13,172
For the tourists, of course.
One of our many special services.

861
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:16,732
And I suppose these are tourists?

862
01:00:16,852 --> 01:00:19,452
No, sir. These people are contributors.

863
01:00:19,732 --> 01:00:22,373
We are collecting donations for the Red Cross.

864
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,693
Forgive me.

865
01:00:34,613 --> 01:00:37,254
What did you say?
What were you two talking about?

866
01:00:37,374 --> 01:00:38,494
I said to him:

867
01:00:38,614 --> 01:00:41,694
"These are nice fat ones,
for this the archbishop will bless you."

868
01:00:41,814 --> 01:00:44,094
He said to me, "I do my share."

869
01:00:44,414 --> 01:00:46,334
Word for word, a literal translation.

870
01:00:46,454 --> 01:00:50,094
Don't try to deceive me.
You're collecting all this for the Olympia.

871
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:53,495
- You see through me like a piece of glass.
- Complete waste of time.

872
01:00:53,615 --> 01:00:55,815
They won't accept food from us, nor from you.

873
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:59,495
True, but they will accept
from the Red Cross when they sail.

874
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,335
Perhaps you're right.

875
01:01:03,255 --> 01:01:05,495
What do you mean, "when they sail"?

876
01:01:06,335 --> 01:01:10,056
It was my poor way of expressing
confidence in British justice.

877
01:01:11,336 --> 01:01:12,496
Good day.

878
01:01:27,097 --> 01:01:30,337
You'd better go up and tell them.
Give me a hand here.

879
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,657
Let us through, please.

880
01:01:45,498 --> 01:01:49,978
It gives me great pain to inform you
Dr. Odenheim has suffered a heart attack.

881
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:52,058
He is dead.

882
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:56,738
Shall I send it out?

883
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:01,859
Why not?

884
01:02:03,899 --> 01:02:06,179
Professor Dr. Samuel Odenheim...

885
01:02:07,219 --> 01:02:09,499
head of the first clinic for Internal Medicine...

886
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:13,619
at the University of Vienna,
author of many medical textbooks...

887
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:17,180
died today in the harbour of Famagusta...

888
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:23,140
on board a cramped freighter going nowhere,
because there wasn't room for him on this earth.

889
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,540
Ought to make news somewhere.

890
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:34,701
Attention, please.
Prepare all children under the age of 13...

891
01:02:34,821 --> 01:02:37,661
for return to Karaolos. This is an order.

892
01:02:41,981 --> 01:02:44,101
- Out to the ship once more?
- Yes.

893
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:47,342
You know, they're in their 92nd hour,
and starting to crack already.

894
01:02:47,462 --> 01:02:49,822
- I didn't know that.
- Fading fast.

895
01:02:50,022 --> 01:02:52,022
They never would have started this nonsense...

896
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:54,182
if Ben Canaan hadn't held a gun to them.

897
01:02:54,302 --> 01:02:56,742
- Do you really think so?
- Undoubtedly.

898
01:02:57,022 --> 01:03:00,182
Poor, ruddy beggars.
I don't see how you stand them.

899
01:03:06,623 --> 01:03:09,103
Then let me ask you this, if I may.

900
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:12,743
Do you have the power to call off this strike?

901
01:03:12,863 --> 01:03:13,983
I have.

902
01:03:15,663 --> 01:03:18,223
If a compelling reason turned up. Why?

903
01:03:18,543 --> 01:03:19,904
Then call it off.

904
01:03:20,024 --> 01:03:22,344
I've been talking to Gen. Sutherland.

905
01:03:22,464 --> 01:03:25,464
He's a humane man,
but there's nothing he can do.

906
01:03:25,824 --> 01:03:28,864
You've made the issue so flatly
that no one can help you.

907
01:03:28,984 --> 01:03:32,344
I know it, I feel it.
Either you compromise, or you lose.

908
01:03:33,504 --> 01:03:34,904
We won't lose.

909
01:03:35,464 --> 01:03:37,745
If the British give in and let us go, we've won.

910
01:03:37,865 --> 01:03:41,105
And if we starve to death aboard this ship,
we've still won.

911
01:03:41,225 --> 01:03:42,625
They'll wait.

912
01:03:43,105 --> 01:03:46,705
They'll wait until you're too weak
and then come aboard and take you off.

913
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:50,665
It doesn't take much strength
to set off 200 pounds of dynamite.

914
01:03:51,505 --> 01:03:53,906
You'd still set it off, knowing you've lost?

915
01:03:54,026 --> 01:03:55,266
Of course.

916
01:03:55,986 --> 01:03:59,186
Without any regard
for the lives you'd be destroying?

917
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,146
With every regard in the world for them.

918
01:04:02,386 --> 01:04:04,066
I don't understand.

919
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:07,426
Each person on board this ship is a soldier.

920
01:04:07,906 --> 01:04:11,667
The only weapon we have to fight with
is our willingness to die.

921
01:04:13,347 --> 01:04:15,027
But for what purpose?

922
01:04:15,987 --> 01:04:17,547
Call it publicity.

923
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,547
- Publicity?
- Yes, publicity.

924
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:21,747
A stunt to attract attention.

925
01:04:22,507 --> 01:04:24,507
A letter to the newspapers.

926
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,988
A help-wanted ad to the official journal
of the United Nations.

927
01:04:30,188 --> 01:04:33,348
"Wanted by 600 men,
women and children, a country...

928
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:36,028
"...a native land, a home."

929
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,548
That's all they're dying for.

930
01:04:38,668 --> 01:04:40,988
Just to call attention to Israel...

931
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:43,789
without ever having seen it themselves.

932
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:46,789
Does the vulgarity of it shock you?

933
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:52,709
You can't fight the whole British Empire
with 600 people.

934
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:54,349
It isn't possible.

935
01:04:54,469 --> 01:04:56,829
How many Minutemen did you have
when they fired...

936
01:04:56,949 --> 01:04:58,510
the "shot heard round the world"?

937
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,270
- I don't know.
- 77.

938
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:04,150
Look, please understand me.

939
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:07,110
I wish you could win.

940
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:10,990
I wish it were possible for you
to have a country of your own.

941
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,470
But it isn't.

942
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:16,471
You're offering the lives of all these people
for something that can never happen.

943
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:18,791
I know. I've been in Palestine.

944
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:22,111
- When were you there?
- A year ago.

945
01:05:23,111 --> 01:05:27,151
Mr. Ben Canaan, even if you get a partition
and a free Jewish state...

946
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:30,152
the Arabs won't let you keep it.

947
01:05:30,272 --> 01:05:33,552
500,000 Jews against 50 million Arabs?

948
01:05:34,312 --> 01:05:35,552
You can't win.

949
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,072
You think I'm a fool.

950
01:05:40,832 --> 01:05:43,992
But I came to appeal to you
to call off the hunger strike...

951
01:05:44,112 --> 01:05:45,552
and avoid a tragedy.

952
01:05:45,672 --> 01:05:48,193
Why don't you appeal to Gen. Sutherland?

953
01:05:48,313 --> 01:05:49,953
What can I tell him?

954
01:05:51,193 --> 01:05:53,393
Tell him what God said to Moses:

955
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:57,593
"Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,
'Thus sayeth the Lord:

956
01:05:58,713 --> 01:06:01,513
"'Let my people go, that they may serve me."'

957
01:06:03,194 --> 01:06:05,234
Exodus, Chapter 7, Verse 26.

958
01:06:08,434 --> 01:06:11,474
We have been asked to talk to you,
Mr. Ben Canaan.

959
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:13,634
- Do you have time?
- Of course.

960
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:16,714
Excuse me.

961
01:06:29,595 --> 01:06:32,275
We have made a decision among the mothers.

962
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:35,476
To send the children back to Karaolos now
will show weakness.

963
01:06:35,596 --> 01:06:38,676
The British will see
that we are not serious people aboard this ship.

964
01:06:38,796 --> 01:06:40,596
It doesn't matter what the British think.

965
01:06:40,716 --> 01:06:44,276
I cannot take the responsibility
for letting children starve to death.

966
01:06:44,396 --> 01:06:46,116
We will take the responsibility.

967
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:48,956
We will not send them back,
and we will not go back with them.

968
01:06:49,356 --> 01:06:52,477
I'm sorry, Mrs. Frankel.
The children must go back.

969
01:06:52,757 --> 01:06:55,717
You go back if you want to with them.
Now, that's a Haganah order.

970
01:06:55,837 --> 01:06:59,637
You're an important man,
Mr. Ari Ben Canaan, but you know nothing.

971
01:06:59,757 --> 01:07:03,197
Look at these babies of mine.
Born behind barbed wire.

972
01:07:04,397 --> 01:07:08,598
For the first time they don't have to
look out through a fence like little animals.

973
01:07:08,718 --> 01:07:10,878
They are free now, and nobody...

974
01:07:11,078 --> 01:07:14,518
no Englishman, no Haganah,
will ever lock them up again.

975
01:07:14,638 --> 01:07:16,678
Look at Mrs. Hirschberg here.

976
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:20,118
Hers will be the first,
when she has no more milk to give.

977
01:07:20,238 --> 01:07:23,958
- Tell him.
- I will not take him back to Karaolos.

978
01:07:24,078 --> 01:07:28,599
He will go to Palestine with me,
or here on this ship, we will die together.

979
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,479
I will not take him back.

980
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,800
When are you going to stop this thing
and let them go?

981
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,320
Unfortunately, I can't answer that.
The affair's entirely in the hands of London.

982
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,640
But you don't like what's going on.
You know how wrong it is.

983
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,000
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you make a public statement about it?

984
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,921
I can't do that, Kitty. I'm a soldier.

985
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:01,761
I know you're a soldier, but you're also a Jew...

986
01:08:01,881 --> 01:08:04,441
and all these people out there are Jews, too.

987
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:08,841
I don't like to disappoint you,
but I'm not in any degree a Jew.

988
01:08:09,441 --> 01:08:11,481
- But I thought...
- I know the rumour.

989
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:13,322
There had to be some explanation...

990
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:16,082
for my attitude
towards this unpleasant business.

991
01:08:18,802 --> 01:08:23,042
- I'm sorry for flying off like that.
- You're getting to be quite a Zionist.

992
01:08:24,842 --> 01:08:27,362
As a matter of fact, I'm glad you did fly off.

993
01:08:28,362 --> 01:08:31,763
You asked how I, as a Jew,
could let this happen to other Jews.

994
01:08:32,283 --> 01:08:35,643
Now I find myself asking
how can any man let it happen?

995
01:08:35,843 --> 01:08:38,723
Jew, Gentile, Buddhist, Mohammedan...

996
01:08:39,123 --> 01:08:40,923
no matter what he is.

997
01:08:54,884 --> 01:08:58,604
Signal the air base.
I'm flying to London within the hour.

998
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:14,085
You know, you're an interesting woman,
Mrs. Fremont.

999
01:09:15,165 --> 01:09:17,885
Sutherland won't let one member
of the press come aboard...

1000
01:09:18,005 --> 01:09:20,646
and you shuttle back and forth
like a carrier pigeon.

1001
01:09:20,886 --> 01:09:24,446
I know you suspect me,
and I know nothing I say can make you trust me.

1002
01:09:25,046 --> 01:09:28,126
But I wanted to tell you
that Gen. Sutherland has left for London.

1003
01:09:28,246 --> 01:09:31,166
He understands your situation,
and he is trying to help.

1004
01:09:31,286 --> 01:09:32,206
Thanks.

1005
01:09:34,006 --> 01:09:35,207
Is that all?

1006
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,407
I heard of Dr. Odenheim's death.

1007
01:09:40,847 --> 01:09:43,487
I'm a trained nurse,
and I worked with him at Karaolos.

1008
01:09:44,087 --> 01:09:47,007
If I can be useful, I'd be glad to stay aboard.

1009
01:09:47,127 --> 01:09:48,287
Without food?

1010
01:09:50,007 --> 01:09:52,528
I think I can go without food as long as you.

1011
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,648
I'm glad to have you on board, Mrs. Fremont.

1012
01:10:00,128 --> 01:10:02,848
Glad to be aboard, Mr. Ben Canaan.

1013
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:41,931
Whatever move you make,
you were dead 10 minutes ago.

1014
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:44,531
I asked for an opinion from Romania?

1015
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,731
Do you think the British will give in?

1016
01:10:51,091 --> 01:10:52,771
We'll give in first.

1017
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:55,131
These schlemiels.

1018
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:58,452
Maybe they think they've been hungry
once in a while.

1019
01:10:58,652 --> 01:11:01,732
They don't even begin to know
what real starvation is.

1020
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:06,452
If you hate these people so much,
why do you want to go to Palestine with them?

1021
01:11:06,652 --> 01:11:09,532
Because there, Jews fight instead of talk.

1022
01:11:12,252 --> 01:11:15,533
When I get there, I'm going to join the Irgun.

1023
01:11:16,573 --> 01:11:18,093
They know how to do it.

1024
01:11:18,973 --> 01:11:22,693
I'm going to blow up every
British installation I can find.

1025
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,493
I'm going to kill Englishmen...

1026
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:27,933
and kill and kill them...

1027
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,374
till there won't be any more.

1028
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:34,214
- But the British aren't all bad.
- They're rotten, the whole bunch of them.

1029
01:11:34,694 --> 01:11:36,614
The British, all the Russians, the Poles...

1030
01:11:36,734 --> 01:11:39,614
- Not the Danes. When I was there...
- Them, too. Don't tell me.

1031
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:40,974
That's not true.

1032
01:11:41,094 --> 01:11:43,774
The Hansens were Christians,
and they adopted me.

1033
01:11:45,495 --> 01:11:48,135
One little exception. That proves something?

1034
01:11:48,255 --> 01:11:52,175
There are lots of exceptions.
You just listen to me for a minute.

1035
01:11:52,815 --> 01:11:55,095
When the Nazis marched into Denmark...

1036
01:11:55,215 --> 01:11:58,055
they ordered every Jew
to wear a yellow armband...

1037
01:11:58,175 --> 01:12:00,295
with the Star of David on it. And when they...

1038
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:02,896
- That's the worst thing that can happen?
- I said, listen!

1039
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:05,056
You don't know what you're talking about.

1040
01:12:05,256 --> 01:12:08,936
The next morning, when every Jew in Denmark
had to wear his armband...

1041
01:12:09,056 --> 01:12:12,656
King Christian came out of Amalienborg Palace
for his morning ride.

1042
01:12:12,936 --> 01:12:14,696
And do you know something?

1043
01:12:14,816 --> 01:12:17,816
- He wore the Star of David on his arm.
- But why should...

1044
01:12:17,936 --> 01:12:19,377
And you know something else?

1045
01:12:19,497 --> 01:12:22,737
By afternoon,
everybody was wearing Stars of David.

1046
01:12:23,137 --> 01:12:27,577
Jews and Danes, and, well, just everybody.

1047
01:12:29,457 --> 01:12:31,097
Why'd they do that?

1048
01:12:34,538 --> 01:12:38,418
If you don't just know why they did it, Dov...

1049
01:12:39,698 --> 01:12:42,178
well, maybe that's what's wrong with you.

1050
01:12:53,339 --> 01:12:55,819
- Get the Olympia. I want to talk to them.
- Yes, sir.

1051
01:12:57,099 --> 01:12:59,299
Control Headquarters calling the Olympia.

1052
01:13:00,899 --> 01:13:03,139
- Do you hear me?
- This is the Exodus.

1053
01:13:03,299 --> 01:13:04,779
Stand by for Maj. Caldwell.

1054
01:13:04,899 --> 01:13:07,940
You are no longer interested
in your last rook, Mr. Lakavitch?

1055
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,820
We pause for politics?

1056
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:14,860
Gen. Sutherland, at his own request,
has been relieved of his duties on Cyprus.

1057
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,260
I have just received a message
from the Colonial Office. I quote:

1058
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:24,581
"His Majesty's Government,
having no desire to witness needless suffering...

1059
01:13:24,941 --> 01:13:28,061
"...grants permission
for the Olympia to sail to Palestine...

1060
01:13:28,341 --> 01:13:31,581
"...and to disembark its passengers
at the port of Haifa."

1061
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:33,821
That is all.

1062
01:13:54,942 --> 01:13:56,823
Ari Ben Canaan!

1063
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,630
Well, happy landing, Mrs. Fremont.

1064
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,750
- You'll find your luggage at customs.
- Thank you.

1065
01:15:57,870 --> 01:16:01,750
Have you seen Mr. Ben Canaan?
I want to thank him for letting me on the ship.

1066
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:04,750
He and the other Haganah guys
went over the side two hours ago.

1067
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:07,831
Too many British soldiers
on the reception committee.

1068
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,112
- Karen?
- Have you seen Dov?

1069
01:16:25,552 --> 01:16:27,112
No, not since he left the ship.

1070
01:16:27,232 --> 01:16:30,152
- He was assigned to Gan Dafna.
- He'll show up.

1071
01:16:30,392 --> 01:16:33,752
I'm going to the American consulate
and then to the Jewish Agency.

1072
01:16:33,872 --> 01:16:36,512
As soon as I find anything,
I’ll come to Gan Dafna.

1073
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:37,592
Gan Dafna, all aboard.

1074
01:16:37,712 --> 01:16:40,913
- Bye, Karen.
- If you see Dov, tell him where I am.

1075
01:17:51,117 --> 01:17:52,037
Inside.

1076
01:18:02,838 --> 01:18:06,478
This is no accident, he's got the address
written down. Fetch the car.

1077
01:18:08,838 --> 01:18:11,798
Here, you dirty little Irgun swine.

1078
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,320
Hello?

1079
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,440
Shalom.

1080
01:18:51,801 --> 01:18:54,241
Yoav, take the dog out.

1081
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:55,721
Again?

1082
01:18:55,841 --> 01:18:58,321
A boy about 17 just went into Asa's house.

1083
01:18:58,441 --> 01:19:01,441
They took him in a police car. Get a look at him.

1084
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:20,806
- What's your name?
- Karen. What's yours?

1085
01:20:20,926 --> 01:20:23,606
Edna. Come, we'll go up and eat something.

1086
01:21:08,289 --> 01:21:11,889
Now, if you will please resume a little order...

1087
01:21:12,329 --> 01:21:16,609
I will introduce a man
who has done more than any other...

1088
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:19,690
to establish our village of Gan Dafna.

1089
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:21,730
Only 10 days ago...

1090
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:24,810
he was in London, negotiating with the British.

1091
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:27,330
Today he is home again.

1092
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:32,090
I have the honour to present
Mr. Barak Ben Canaan...

1093
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:34,571
member of the Executive Committee...

1094
01:21:34,691 --> 01:21:37,411
of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.

1095
01:21:44,411 --> 01:21:47,611
My dear young friends, I know you're very tired.

1096
01:21:47,731 --> 01:21:51,132
You've had a long trip,
so I'm not going to make speeches.

1097
01:21:52,692 --> 01:21:55,172
It's good to have parties like this.

1098
01:21:55,532 --> 01:21:57,892
But it's also good to know what you're here for.

1099
01:21:58,012 --> 01:22:00,932
You are here to learn. You are here to work.

1100
01:22:01,052 --> 01:22:03,652
You are here to build
a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

1101
01:22:04,332 --> 01:22:08,613
It says on the banner "young heroes." Very fine.

1102
01:22:09,653 --> 01:22:13,853
But here at Gan Dafna you will find
that even the biggest hero...

1103
01:22:13,973 --> 01:22:17,973
must work in the fields,
just like the littlest coward.

1104
01:22:18,853 --> 01:22:22,574
Boys and girls,
when I came to Palestine 47 years ago...

1105
01:22:22,694 --> 01:22:26,374
it was not a musical reception
with little cakes served.

1106
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:30,374
I came walking, with my little brother...

1107
01:22:31,414 --> 01:22:33,534
all the way from Russia.

1108
01:22:34,494 --> 01:22:38,214
And over in that valley,
the swamps, and mosquitoes so big...

1109
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,575
they were picking fights with the sparrows.

1110
01:22:41,335 --> 01:22:44,975
Now we have changed those swamps
into such fields.

1111
01:22:45,175 --> 01:22:48,455
On a quiet night, you can hear the corn grow.

1112
01:22:49,335 --> 01:22:51,775
Oranges so big...

1113
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:54,696
five already make a dozen.

1114
01:22:56,296 --> 01:22:59,896
Over there you see the Arab village of Abu Yesha.

1115
01:23:00,616 --> 01:23:03,296
In those days, my old friend Kammal...

1116
01:23:04,096 --> 01:23:05,816
may God rest his soul...

1117
01:23:06,136 --> 01:23:08,096
was mukhtar of the village.

1118
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:11,257
And then one day,
he donated to us this ground...

1119
01:23:11,377 --> 01:23:13,497
on which you stand, for a youth village.

1120
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:16,897
So, we began to build this place.

1121
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:20,457
And again it wasn't a matter
of little cakes and music.

1122
01:23:20,577 --> 01:23:23,337
It meant more sweat, more work.

1123
01:23:24,297 --> 01:23:25,417
Look about you.

1124
01:23:25,697 --> 01:23:27,498
You will see Arab children here.

1125
01:23:27,618 --> 01:23:30,738
Three of them, grandsons of that same Kammal...

1126
01:23:30,858 --> 01:23:32,658
the mukhtar who gave us this land.

1127
01:23:33,018 --> 01:23:35,738
It grieves me that he isn't with us today
to see all this.

1128
01:23:35,858 --> 01:23:38,778
But he's been gathered to the bosom of Allah.

1129
01:23:39,258 --> 01:23:41,658
Speak always that name with respect.

1130
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:46,739
With us, instead,
we have the son of Kammal, Taha...

1131
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:49,059
an honour to his father's memory.

1132
01:23:52,139 --> 01:23:55,899
Raised part of the time in my house,
with my own dear son, Ari...

1133
01:23:56,019 --> 01:23:59,739
and with my dear daughter, Jordana,
who sits beside him in this place.

1134
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:03,260
I want you to give particular attention
to what he's going to tell to you.

1135
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:07,540
Here is Taha, son of Kammal, since five years...

1136
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,940
mukhtar of Abu Yesha.

1137
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:16,541
Thank you, Barak Ben Canaan.
Village president, Dr. Ernst Lieberman.

1138
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:22,421
In this valley of Jezreel,
we dwell together as friends.

1139
01:24:23,461 --> 01:24:25,541
It is natural that we should live in peace.

1140
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:28,661
Since even our words for it
are almost exactly the same.

1141
01:24:28,821 --> 01:24:30,701
We say salaam...

1142
01:24:31,021 --> 01:24:32,982
and you, shalom.

1143
01:24:34,542 --> 01:24:38,262
Let us seal our friendship forever
with that most beautiful of Hebrew toasts.

1144
01:24:38,702 --> 01:24:40,702
L'chaim, to life.

1145
01:24:41,462 --> 01:24:42,382
L'chaim!

1146
01:24:55,583 --> 01:24:56,743
Come on.

1147
01:24:59,863 --> 01:25:01,143
Dov Landau.

1148
01:25:02,983 --> 01:25:05,824
Immigration says you're legal,
so we've no reason to keep you.

1149
01:25:05,944 --> 01:25:08,184
The Jewish Agency sent a bus ticket
and lunch money.

1150
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:09,784
You're assigned to Gan Dafna.

1151
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:11,704
You take my advice and go there.

1152
01:25:11,824 --> 01:25:13,944
Don't hang around Haifa. You'll get in trouble.

1153
01:25:14,064 --> 01:25:15,624
Don't wander into the Arab section.

1154
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:18,784
Or you'll run into the Mufti's gangsters
and they'll kill you, son.

1155
01:25:18,904 --> 01:25:20,544
They'll slit your throat.

1156
01:25:20,904 --> 01:25:22,785
And keep away from the Irgun.

1157
01:26:23,948 --> 01:26:28,189
- And then, after the ghetto was destroyed?
- I hid in the sewers for five months.

1158
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:29,549
Eating what?

1159
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:33,829
When I couldn't sneak out at night
and steal garbage, I killed rats.

1160
01:26:34,869 --> 01:26:36,429
And then one night they caught me.

1161
01:26:36,549 --> 01:26:38,709
- And they sent you to Auschwitz?
- Yes.

1162
01:26:39,749 --> 01:26:42,069
To what work were you assigned in Auschwitz?

1163
01:26:42,229 --> 01:26:44,750
I told you that twice already.
It was mostly clean up.

1164
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:47,990
- Cleaning up what?
- The camp area.

1165
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:50,950
That's all there was to do.
That and working in the kitchens.

1166
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:54,910
And when Auschwitz was liberated,
you walked to Germany?

1167
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,310
You asked me that already, too.

1168
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:59,791
May I talk with the young man for a moment?

1169
01:27:00,871 --> 01:27:04,191
So you want to blow up British installations
for the Irgun?

1170
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:05,271
Yes.

1171
01:27:06,271 --> 01:27:09,231
You're an expert dynamiter, true?

1172
01:27:09,551 --> 01:27:10,631
Just try me.

1173
01:27:12,071 --> 01:27:15,071
There's still a point or two
we do not completely understand.

1174
01:27:15,191 --> 01:27:18,392
- Will you assist us in making them clear?
- Sure.

1175
01:27:20,352 --> 01:27:22,352
And make certain to tell the truth?

1176
01:27:22,712 --> 01:27:24,592
Why shouldn't I tell the truth?

1177
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,912
This is always hard to answer.

1178
01:27:28,472 --> 01:27:32,793
First, I will ask you, please,
to recreate for me again how it was in Auschwitz.

1179
01:27:32,913 --> 01:27:36,913
Now, think most carefully about it,
and describe it to me.

1180
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:41,833
- Describe what?
- Whatever you like.

1181
01:27:41,953 --> 01:27:45,593
For instance, how it was that people
were chosen to live or to be killed.

1182
01:27:50,394 --> 01:27:52,074
First you undressed...

1183
01:27:52,794 --> 01:27:54,714
and then they clipped your hair.

1184
01:27:55,474 --> 01:27:58,434
And then you all lined up,
and you went to the station room.

1185
01:27:58,994 --> 01:28:02,234
So the way you remember it,
they were men, women, children...

1186
01:28:02,354 --> 01:28:04,795
all together and all naked.

1187
01:28:05,915 --> 01:28:06,875
Yes.

1188
01:28:07,995 --> 01:28:09,915
And then the doctors examined you...

1189
01:28:10,395 --> 01:28:12,115
and told you what gate to take.

1190
01:28:12,235 --> 01:28:14,995
There were three gates.

1191
01:28:15,515 --> 01:28:18,995
If you were to be killed,
then you went through the left gate.

1192
01:28:19,835 --> 01:28:21,356
Which most of them did.

1193
01:28:22,236 --> 01:28:24,316
Yes. Most.

1194
01:28:24,796 --> 01:28:28,596
But if you were strong enough to work,
then you went through the right gate.

1195
01:28:28,876 --> 01:28:29,876
Which you did.

1196
01:28:30,796 --> 01:28:31,756
Yes.

1197
01:28:32,276 --> 01:28:36,116
- And then they assigned you to...
- You said there were three gates.

1198
01:28:39,477 --> 01:28:41,157
Who went through the third gate?

1199
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:42,797
Girls.

1200
01:28:43,517 --> 01:28:45,717
- All the girls?
- No.

1201
01:28:46,037 --> 01:28:48,077
Only if they were young and pretty.

1202
01:28:49,717 --> 01:28:51,117
What happened to them?

1203
01:28:53,197 --> 01:28:55,198
The SS guards kept some of them.

1204
01:28:55,318 --> 01:28:57,598
The rest were sent around to army camps...

1205
01:28:58,838 --> 01:29:00,118
for the soldiers.

1206
01:29:01,998 --> 01:29:03,318
You have a good memory.

1207
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:07,118
Now, those who went
through the left gate to be killed...

1208
01:29:07,518 --> 01:29:10,399
how was the killing accomplished
in Auschwitz?

1209
01:29:10,999 --> 01:29:14,479
They went in to take showers,
2,000 or 3,000 at a time.

1210
01:29:15,519 --> 01:29:17,199
And the doors were locked.

1211
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:19,639
And then came the gas.

1212
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:23,199
Very professional. One thing I overlooked.

1213
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:27,680
You say you got this dynamiting experience
in the Warsaw Ghetto fighting Nazis.

1214
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:29,760
That's right.

1215
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,920
You blew up quite a few Nazis
with this dynamite?

1216
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,840
All I could.

1217
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,520
Good.

1218
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,680
Now, return to Auschwitz, please.

1219
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,560
From the gas chambers, the bodies went where?

1220
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,360
The ovens.

1221
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,640
At Auschwitz,
they had crematoriums only at the last.

1222
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,999
Before the installation of the ovens,
what happened to the bodies?

1223
01:29:57,519 --> 01:29:58,799
They buried them.

1224
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:00,599
How?

1225
01:30:03,839 --> 01:30:05,399
In trenches and holes.

1226
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:09,799
- And who dug the holes?
- I don't know.

1227
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:14,239
I ask you again, who dug the graves?

1228
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,119
I don't know.

1229
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:30,079
They had demolition squads.

1230
01:30:32,959 --> 01:30:35,278
At least sometimes they did.

1231
01:30:37,318 --> 01:30:39,478
To blow holes in the ground...

1232
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:41,918
then dump the bodies in.

1233
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:44,318
That is correct.

1234
01:30:48,038 --> 01:30:50,718
Now may I tell you something, Dov Landau?

1235
01:30:52,118 --> 01:30:55,918
At no time did the Jews use dynamite
in the Warsaw Ghetto.

1236
01:30:56,278 --> 01:30:57,718
They had no dynamite.

1237
01:30:58,598 --> 01:31:00,358
Do you remember better now?

1238
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:04,718
Maybe.

1239
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:10,398
So it was not possible for you to learn
the use of dynamite in the Warsaw Ghetto.

1240
01:31:10,718 --> 01:31:12,758
You learned about dynamite in Auschwitz...

1241
01:31:12,878 --> 01:31:15,717
making mass graves to receive
the dead bodies of your people.

1242
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:16,957
True?

1243
01:31:18,037 --> 01:31:19,197
Yes.

1244
01:31:20,157 --> 01:31:22,957
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them.

1245
01:31:26,837 --> 01:31:31,077
And you saved your own life
by working in that camp as a Sonderkommando.

1246
01:31:31,677 --> 01:31:33,557
- Correct?
- Yes.

1247
01:31:35,757 --> 01:31:38,757
It was the duty of those Jews
who became Sonderkommandos...

1248
01:31:38,877 --> 01:31:40,997
to shave the heads of other Jews.

1249
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:42,837
Yes.

1250
01:31:44,277 --> 01:31:46,877
To remove dead bodies from the gas chambers.

1251
01:31:47,957 --> 01:31:50,477
To collect gold fillings from their teeth.

1252
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:54,797
Yes!

1253
01:32:06,476 --> 01:32:07,836
What could I do?

1254
01:32:24,836 --> 01:32:29,476
We take into consideration that you were
less than 13 when you entered Auschwitz.

1255
01:32:29,596 --> 01:32:31,556
Even so, we must have the truth.

1256
01:32:33,356 --> 01:32:35,196
Is there anything else?

1257
01:32:39,675 --> 01:32:40,635
Yes.

1258
01:32:42,155 --> 01:32:43,315
Then tell us.

1259
01:32:46,195 --> 01:32:48,075
No, I won't tell you.

1260
01:32:49,115 --> 01:32:50,755
Please, don't make me tell you.

1261
01:32:51,915 --> 01:32:53,475
Kill me. I don't care.

1262
01:32:53,595 --> 01:32:55,715
- I won't tell you.
- Tell us.

1263
01:33:14,075 --> 01:33:15,955
They used me.

1264
01:33:17,234 --> 01:33:19,114
They used me...

1265
01:33:19,834 --> 01:33:21,274
like you use...

1266
01:33:21,954 --> 01:33:23,234
a woman.

1267
01:33:59,273 --> 01:34:01,953
You will repeat for me the following words:

1268
01:34:02,633 --> 01:34:04,313
"I, Dov Landau...

1269
01:34:05,353 --> 01:34:06,753
I, Dov Landau...

1270
01:34:06,873 --> 01:34:09,753
"...do give my body, my brain,
my soul and my being...

1271
01:34:10,713 --> 01:34:13,633
do give my body, my brain,
my soul and my being...

1272
01:34:13,753 --> 01:34:16,153
"...without reservation or qualification...

1273
01:34:16,473 --> 01:34:18,593
without reservation or qualification...

1274
01:34:18,713 --> 01:34:21,113
"...to the freedom fighters of the Irgun.

1275
01:34:21,553 --> 01:34:23,593
to the freedom fighters of the Irgun.

1276
01:34:23,753 --> 01:34:25,633
"Under torture, even unto death...

1277
01:34:25,753 --> 01:34:27,713
Under torture, even unto death...

1278
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:30,913
"...I will never divulge the name
of a fellow member of the Irgun."

1279
01:34:31,033 --> 01:34:34,353
I will never divulge the name
of a fellow member of the Irgun.

1280
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:19,070
- You wanted me?
- Yes.

1281
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,430
- So?
- I've got to see Akiva. Where is he?

1282
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:25,470
We tell Haganah where our leaders are hiding?

1283
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:27,550
Forget Haganah. Akiva's my uncle.

1284
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:32,230
And Barak Ben Canaan is your father.
We trust him as we trust the Grand Mufti.

1285
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:35,910
- His son's different?
- Just tell Akiva and let him decide.

1286
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:40,469
- I don't even know if he's in Jerusalem.
- So tell him anyway.

1287
01:36:42,389 --> 01:36:45,509
If I can find him,
where can I telephone you this evening?

1288
01:36:45,629 --> 01:36:48,069
I'll be here on the terrace from 7:00 on.

1289
01:37:24,868 --> 01:37:26,508
Do you like the view here?

1290
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:28,748
Mr. Ben Canaan.

1291
01:37:28,948 --> 01:37:31,228
- Are we both eating alone?
- I am.

1292
01:37:31,668 --> 01:37:34,908
- Or I was. Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.

1293
01:37:35,668 --> 01:37:38,908
I know all the good things on that menu.
May I order for you?

1294
01:37:39,988 --> 01:37:42,548
- Would you like a drink?
- I had one at the consulate.

1295
01:37:42,668 --> 01:37:44,988
I had another one when I came to my room.

1296
01:37:45,108 --> 01:37:46,428
Have another one.

1297
01:37:46,748 --> 01:37:49,348
- Dry martini.
- Two very dry martinis.

1298
01:37:55,188 --> 01:37:56,508
Excuse me, sir.

1299
01:37:58,228 --> 01:38:00,947
I'll take the hors d'oeuvres, clear soup...

1300
01:38:02,147 --> 01:38:03,667
fillet of sole...

1301
01:38:04,227 --> 01:38:05,307
salad...

1302
01:38:06,187 --> 01:38:09,507
and some of your very good Chablis.
We'll order dessert later.

1303
01:38:09,627 --> 01:38:10,827
Yes, sir.

1304
01:38:12,787 --> 01:38:14,827
What were you doing at the consulate today?

1305
01:38:15,907 --> 01:38:18,507
I've asked them to help me find Karen's father.

1306
01:38:18,707 --> 01:38:21,147
Yes, the girl. Please forget what I said...

1307
01:38:21,267 --> 01:38:23,867
about getting hysterical
over the life of one child.

1308
01:38:23,987 --> 01:38:25,147
I didn't mean it.

1309
01:38:25,507 --> 01:38:27,067
I know you didn't.

1310
01:38:27,187 --> 01:38:29,747
What happens if you find out her father's dead?

1311
01:38:30,427 --> 01:38:32,987
Then I'll take her back to America with me.

1312
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:36,627
If she likes it there, I may adopt her.

1313
01:38:37,227 --> 01:38:39,867
Won't your husband
have something to say about that?

1314
01:38:39,987 --> 01:38:41,786
My husband was killed a year ago...

1315
01:38:41,906 --> 01:38:44,946
in a border skirmish
near the Sheikh Hussein bridge.

1316
01:38:45,066 --> 01:38:46,826
You mean, here in Palestine?

1317
01:38:46,946 --> 01:38:49,826
He was a news photographer
covering the Near East.

1318
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:57,026
About the girl's father, if you like,
I can put some of our Haganah boys on it.

1319
01:39:07,626 --> 01:39:10,266
The British High Commissioner to Palestine.

1320
01:39:10,386 --> 01:39:14,186
Taken over the whole south wing of the hotel
in British general headquarters.

1321
01:39:14,306 --> 01:39:18,906
- Don't you feel uncomfortable here?
- I guess I'm as safe here as any place else.

1322
01:39:19,026 --> 01:39:21,545
Besides, I spent 14 months in prison.

1323
01:39:22,585 --> 01:39:25,545
Tell me about yourself.
Where do you come from?

1324
01:39:27,465 --> 01:39:31,345
I don't come from anywhere. I'm a sabra.
A native-born Palestinian.

1325
01:39:31,505 --> 01:39:34,945
My father was born in Russia.
He has a farm near Moshav Yad EI.

1326
01:39:36,225 --> 01:39:39,105
- Do you like farms?
- I was raised on one.

1327
01:39:39,825 --> 01:39:41,505
I'd like to show you ours.

1328
01:39:42,465 --> 01:39:44,065
That'll be a little difficult.

1329
01:39:44,185 --> 01:39:47,425
I've rented a car and I'm driving
to Gan Dafna tomorrow to visit Karen.

1330
01:39:47,545 --> 01:39:49,865
That's only a few miles past Yad EI.

1331
01:39:50,305 --> 01:39:52,265
I'm going up myself in the morning.

1332
01:39:52,385 --> 01:39:55,025
Do I know you well enough to ask you for a lift?

1333
01:39:56,145 --> 01:39:57,465
I think so.

1334
01:39:58,505 --> 01:40:00,785
- My name is Kitty.
- Ari.

1335
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,984
Thank you.

1336
01:40:09,184 --> 01:40:12,104
I'll teach you a Hebrew toast. L'chaim!

1337
01:40:12,824 --> 01:40:14,824
I know it. To life.

1338
01:40:15,584 --> 01:40:16,784
Good for you.

1339
01:40:21,904 --> 01:40:25,184
A year's a long time in the life of a pretty woman.

1340
01:40:25,544 --> 01:40:27,504
Have you found another man?

1341
01:40:28,584 --> 01:40:30,824
- Nothing serious.
- Why not?

1342
01:40:31,944 --> 01:40:33,224
Many reasons.

1343
01:40:33,344 --> 01:40:36,704
One of them is that my husband's work
filled his whole life.

1344
01:40:37,184 --> 01:40:40,864
I presume that's good,
at least most men seem to think so.

1345
01:40:41,983 --> 01:40:45,783
But I feel a man who has nothing but his work
is only half a man.

1346
01:40:45,903 --> 01:40:47,823
And you want a whole one?

1347
01:40:48,663 --> 01:40:49,903
Exactly.

1348
01:40:50,303 --> 01:40:53,583
The other half of his life must be a woman.
What else?

1349
01:40:55,023 --> 01:40:56,223
What else?

1350
01:40:56,343 --> 01:40:59,263
Excuse me, sir. Telephone for you, call, please.

1351
01:41:00,143 --> 01:41:02,303
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

1352
01:41:21,103 --> 01:41:22,502
Come with me.

1353
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:23,662
Now?

1354
01:41:25,102 --> 01:41:29,742
- I have to go back to the terrace. I want...
- You want to arrange to have us followed.

1355
01:41:31,182 --> 01:41:32,342
Let's go.

1356
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,460
Ari.

1357
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:48,020
Come in.

1358
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:55,940
Sit down.

1359
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:04,580
You must have some tea.

1360
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,860
There's an extra glass around here somewhere.

1361
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,420
You look better than ever, Uncle Akiva.

1362
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:18,900
It's an active life.

1363
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:22,220
You've been active yourself recently.

1364
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:26,179
This Exodus business
shows in your heart you're really an Irgunist.

1365
01:43:26,379 --> 01:43:27,859
Two hundred pounds of dynamite?

1366
01:43:27,979 --> 01:43:30,259
Immediately,
the British draw proper conclusions.

1367
01:43:31,499 --> 01:43:35,179
Now, it's no accident
that brings you here tonight.

1368
01:43:36,259 --> 01:43:38,379
- May I speculate?
- Of course.

1369
01:43:42,219 --> 01:43:45,579
The Irgun has been blowing up
too many British installations.

1370
01:43:45,939 --> 01:43:48,259
We behave rudely to our British guests.

1371
01:43:48,499 --> 01:43:53,139
So the leading intellectuals of the Haganah,
after endless meetings and much debate...

1372
01:43:53,259 --> 01:43:55,499
have at last reached a decision.

1373
01:43:55,859 --> 01:43:57,859
- Correct?
- It's close.

1374
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:01,859
They say, "Send Ari Ben Canaan".

1375
01:44:03,539 --> 01:44:06,258
"The old criminal's getting soft in the head".

1376
01:44:06,378 --> 01:44:10,258
"He loves the boy.
Maybe Ari can stop his indelicate activities."

1377
01:44:10,538 --> 01:44:12,538
- Also correct?
- Also.

1378
01:44:13,698 --> 01:44:15,218
But they want something more.

1379
01:44:15,338 --> 01:44:18,498
If the UN votes for Partition,
we'll have the Arab world on our backs.

1380
01:44:18,618 --> 01:44:21,378
Our only hope is an alliance
between Irgunand Haganah.

1381
01:44:21,498 --> 01:44:23,818
An alliance to fight? Of course.

1382
01:44:24,698 --> 01:44:28,498
The minute Haganah adopts our policy
of fighting instead of talking...

1383
01:44:28,858 --> 01:44:31,178
an alliance between us becomes automatic.

1384
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:32,618
You're not being fair.

1385
01:44:32,738 --> 01:44:35,858
When it comes to fighting,
Haganah has lost more lives than Irgun.

1386
01:44:35,978 --> 01:44:40,178
We fight to defend ourselves, or to capture
positions that we can occupy and hold.

1387
01:44:40,298 --> 01:44:42,818
When you attack it's just to spread terror.

1388
01:44:45,097 --> 01:44:48,777
Your duty is done.
You have given me the official line.

1389
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:50,937
But what about you, Ari?

1390
01:44:51,057 --> 01:44:54,297
Forget Haganah for one moment,
and tell me what you think.

1391
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:57,817
I think these bombings and these killings
hurt us with the United Nations.

1392
01:44:57,937 --> 01:45:00,297
A year ago we had the respect
of the whole world.

1393
01:45:00,417 --> 01:45:03,897
Now, when they read about us,
it's nothing but terror and violence.

1394
01:45:05,057 --> 01:45:07,617
It's not the first time this happens in history.

1395
01:45:08,097 --> 01:45:11,457
I don't know of one nation,
whether existing now or in the past...

1396
01:45:11,897 --> 01:45:13,977
that was not born in violence.

1397
01:45:14,497 --> 01:45:17,337
Terror, violence, death.

1398
01:45:18,297 --> 01:45:21,457
They are the midwives
who bring free nations into this world.

1399
01:45:21,577 --> 01:45:24,656
Compromisers like the Haganah
produce only abortions.

1400
01:45:24,776 --> 01:45:27,696
Before you have a country,
you have to have people.

1401
01:45:27,816 --> 01:45:31,096
That's the job we've done.
Tens of thousands of people smuggled in...

1402
01:45:31,216 --> 01:45:34,736
with the whole British Navy
blockading the coast.

1403
01:45:34,856 --> 01:45:38,176
The population we've built
is our most valid argument for independence.

1404
01:45:38,296 --> 01:45:40,656
How can we ask the UN for a just decision...

1405
01:45:40,776 --> 01:45:43,816
when we keep blowing up things
like a bunch of anarchists?

1406
01:45:44,176 --> 01:45:46,896
You have just used the words "a just decision."

1407
01:45:47,056 --> 01:45:48,696
May I tell you something?

1408
01:45:49,576 --> 01:45:50,616
Firstly...

1409
01:45:51,336 --> 01:45:53,736
justice itself is an abstraction...

1410
01:45:54,096 --> 01:45:56,296
completely devoid of reality.

1411
01:45:56,496 --> 01:46:00,776
Second, to speak of justice and Jews
in the same breath...

1412
01:46:01,896 --> 01:46:03,696
is a logical uncertainty.

1413
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:05,215
Thirdly...

1414
01:46:05,335 --> 01:46:08,775
one can argue the justice
of Arab claims on Palestine...

1415
01:46:08,895 --> 01:46:11,775
just as one can argue
the justice of Jewish claims.

1416
01:46:12,655 --> 01:46:13,575
Fourthly...

1417
01:46:14,135 --> 01:46:16,255
no one can say the Jews have not had...

1418
01:46:16,375 --> 01:46:19,175
more than their share of injustice
these past 10 years.

1419
01:46:19,295 --> 01:46:21,375
I therefore say, fifthly...

1420
01:46:22,535 --> 01:46:25,935
let the next injustice
work against somebody else for a change.

1421
01:46:26,055 --> 01:46:28,175
You just changed the subject on me.

1422
01:46:28,615 --> 01:46:29,775
You noticed.

1423
01:46:29,895 --> 01:46:32,695
I suppose that means more bombings
and more killings?

1424
01:46:33,055 --> 01:46:34,455
I'll put it this way.

1425
01:46:34,615 --> 01:46:38,455
Let the National Committee keep on trying
to talk the British out of Palestine.

1426
01:46:38,695 --> 01:46:42,495
We have no objections.
We will continue to bomb them out.

1427
01:46:44,335 --> 01:46:47,214
- Now tell me, how is your mother?
- She's fine.

1428
01:46:48,014 --> 01:46:49,814
And little Jordana?

1429
01:46:51,294 --> 01:46:55,094
Little Jordana just won her second
marksmanship medal with the Palmach.

1430
01:46:56,614 --> 01:47:00,894
And that young rascal, David Ben Ami,
she's still interested?

1431
01:47:01,014 --> 01:47:03,614
She can't wait till he gets back from Cyprus.

1432
01:47:04,454 --> 01:47:05,734
And Barak...

1433
01:47:06,934 --> 01:47:10,134
still counts my name among the dead
on Yom Kippur?

1434
01:47:16,254 --> 01:47:17,614
Ten years.

1435
01:47:20,494 --> 01:47:23,854
It's a long time to be dead
to the only family you have.

1436
01:47:28,133 --> 01:47:30,973
Doesn't he understand
I must work for Israel in my way...

1437
01:47:31,093 --> 01:47:33,093
just as he works for it in his?

1438
01:47:33,893 --> 01:47:36,573
You can't talk to him about it. I've tried.

1439
01:47:38,413 --> 01:47:39,453
Of course.

1440
01:47:44,933 --> 01:47:46,813
It's not much of a home, is it?

1441
01:47:48,213 --> 01:47:51,293
With only Rose's samovar to make a memory real.

1442
01:48:06,212 --> 01:48:08,652
Every time I come home,
I stop here to look for a minute.

1443
01:48:08,772 --> 01:48:10,852
- You want to look with me?
- Sure.

1444
01:49:03,691 --> 01:49:04,891
It's beautiful!

1445
01:49:06,851 --> 01:49:08,611
The Valley of Jezreel.

1446
01:49:10,091 --> 01:49:14,091
If you dug straight down far enough there,
you'd find the ruins of Meggido.

1447
01:49:14,531 --> 01:49:18,691
You'd find the very same paving stones
that Joshua walked on when he conquered it.

1448
01:49:19,211 --> 01:49:23,491
That's Abu Yesha. That's an Arab village.
To the left is Gan Dafna.

1449
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:31,690
- Do you know your Bible?
- In a Presbyterian sort of way.

1450
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:36,850
That's Mount Tabor.

1451
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:41,690
I remember.
Where Deborah gathered her armies.

1452
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:46,770
That's where she stood when she watched
Barak march out to fight the Canaanites.

1453
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:51,890
"So Barak went down from Mount Tabor,
and 10,000 men with him."

1454
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:53,730
It's in the Book of Judges.

1455
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:57,850
The Canaanites had 900 iron chariots...

1456
01:49:58,690 --> 01:50:00,170
but Barak had men.

1457
01:50:00,290 --> 01:50:02,170
3,200 years ago.

1458
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:07,010
That's when the Jews first came to this valley.
It wasn't just yesterday or the day before.

1459
01:50:07,569 --> 01:50:09,769
Isn't your father's name Barak?

1460
01:50:09,889 --> 01:50:12,249
In Russia, he was Yakov Rabinski.

1461
01:50:12,449 --> 01:50:15,489
But when he came here,
he took the name of Deborah's general.

1462
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,409
He called himself Barak Ben Canaan.

1463
01:50:17,529 --> 01:50:22,049
Barak, the son of Canaan, and this valley
became a Jewish land once again.

1464
01:50:22,169 --> 01:50:26,329
He can give you the date every clump
of trees was planted there, to the month.

1465
01:50:26,849 --> 01:50:28,449
Don't get excited.

1466
01:50:29,169 --> 01:50:31,009
We're not debating now.

1467
01:50:31,729 --> 01:50:33,729
I'll grant anything you say.

1468
01:50:34,729 --> 01:50:37,209
I just wanted you to know that I'm a Jew.

1469
01:50:37,329 --> 01:50:38,929
This is my country.

1470
01:50:40,169 --> 01:50:42,729
I do know. I understand.

1471
01:50:43,049 --> 01:50:44,849
Sometimes it's not that easy.

1472
01:50:46,209 --> 01:50:48,608
It's the easiest thing in the world, Ari.

1473
01:50:48,728 --> 01:50:51,488
All these differences between people
are made up.

1474
01:50:52,248 --> 01:50:55,128
People are the same,
no matter what they're called.

1475
01:50:55,288 --> 01:50:57,008
Don't ever believe it.

1476
01:50:57,568 --> 01:50:58,928
People are different.

1477
01:50:59,768 --> 01:51:02,488
They have a right to be different.
They like to be different.

1478
01:51:02,608 --> 01:51:05,728
It's no good pretending
the differences don't exist, they do.

1479
01:51:05,888 --> 01:51:08,408
They have to be recognized and respected.

1480
01:51:08,568 --> 01:51:10,848
I recognize them. I respect them.

1481
01:51:13,728 --> 01:51:17,128
Don't you understand
that you make me feel like a Presbyterian...

1482
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:21,088
when you can't, for just a minute or two,
forget that you're a Jew?

1483
01:51:24,448 --> 01:51:25,928
You're wrong, Ari.

1484
01:51:28,168 --> 01:51:30,047
There are no differences.

1485
01:52:23,126 --> 01:52:25,286
Ari, my boy.

1486
01:52:26,846 --> 01:52:28,846
Papa, this is Mrs. Fremont.

1487
01:52:28,966 --> 01:52:30,686
Shalom, Mr. Ben Canaan.

1488
01:52:30,966 --> 01:52:33,926
Welcome to Yad EI, Mrs. Fremont.

1489
01:52:34,886 --> 01:52:37,486
If you'll excuse me, I will tell your mother.

1490
01:52:37,886 --> 01:52:38,766
Mama!

1491
01:52:40,966 --> 01:52:43,566
- Mama, where are you?
- I'm here, Barak.

1492
01:52:43,686 --> 01:52:45,926
- Have you hurt yourself?
- No. Ari is home.

1493
01:52:46,046 --> 01:52:48,446
- Ari?
- He's downstairs! Wait a minute.

1494
01:52:48,606 --> 01:52:50,245
- He's got a girl with him.
- A girl?

1495
01:52:50,365 --> 01:52:52,645
- An American girl.
- How do you know she's American?

1496
01:52:52,765 --> 01:52:55,765
Sarah, I travel. I can recognize national types.

1497
01:52:56,005 --> 01:52:58,885
- What is her name, Barak?
- Mrs. Fremont.

1498
01:52:59,005 --> 01:53:00,525
Mrs? So, where is her husband?

1499
01:53:00,645 --> 01:53:04,565
- Why does she go chasing after my Ari?
- Whether she's chasing him, I don't know.

1500
01:53:04,685 --> 01:53:07,805
If you ask me, "Is Ari chasing her?"
Frankly, that is a possibility.

1501
01:53:07,925 --> 01:53:11,925
For you maybe. Not for my Ari.
Better stop talking like a goat.

1502
01:53:12,045 --> 01:53:16,285
My Ari comes home and there's not a thing
in the house to eat, not a bite.

1503
01:53:18,085 --> 01:53:20,765
Hello! Rebecca.

1504
01:53:22,205 --> 01:53:23,805
Now, say "ah."

1505
01:53:36,444 --> 01:53:37,364
Yes?

1506
01:53:40,164 --> 01:53:43,404
- What a nice surprise.
- Tell my daughter, Jordana.

1507
01:53:43,644 --> 01:53:44,804
Of course.

1508
01:53:45,244 --> 01:53:47,204
No trouble at all.

1509
01:53:54,964 --> 01:53:57,124
There. You're all right.

1510
01:54:22,763 --> 01:54:26,843
Jordana, your brother Ari is at Yad EI,
I just spoke to your papa.

1511
01:54:26,963 --> 01:54:28,683
Ari? Take this for me.

1512
01:54:30,683 --> 01:54:32,803
Now, young ladies and gentlemen...

1513
01:54:33,163 --> 01:54:35,363
can you give me a little style?

1514
01:54:44,803 --> 01:54:47,683
It's not fair keeping David in Cyprus so long.

1515
01:54:48,363 --> 01:54:51,962
He could be doing something just as important
right here in Palestine.

1516
01:54:52,082 --> 01:54:53,882
That's exactly what he says.

1517
01:54:54,402 --> 01:54:57,802
But he tells me in his letter
that he may be gone another year.

1518
01:54:58,202 --> 01:55:01,962
I know Haganah would call him back,
if you would only use your influence.

1519
01:55:02,082 --> 01:55:06,362
Any girl that falls in love with a Palestinian boy
has a long wait coming.

1520
01:55:06,482 --> 01:55:09,122
- A nice piece of strudel, Mrs. Fremont?
- I couldn't.

1521
01:55:09,242 --> 01:55:13,762
Mrs. Fremont, you're a very pretty girl,
but you could stand a little weight on you.

1522
01:55:13,882 --> 01:55:15,842
Also your colour is not too good.

1523
01:55:15,962 --> 01:55:19,362
If it wasn't for me, David wouldn't be in Cyprus
working for Haganah.

1524
01:55:19,482 --> 01:55:22,202
He wanted to join the Irgun. You know that.

1525
01:55:22,402 --> 01:55:25,322
I saw Uncle Akiva in Jerusalem.
He sends you his love.

1526
01:55:25,642 --> 01:55:27,842
You will not mention that name in my house.

1527
01:55:27,962 --> 01:55:29,202
Father, he's all alone.

1528
01:55:29,322 --> 01:55:32,161
- He wants to forget what happened...
- To me, he is dead.

1529
01:55:32,441 --> 01:55:36,041
At this moment when the very existence
of a free Israel hangs by a thread...

1530
01:55:36,161 --> 01:55:39,601
before the UN, he presents us to the world
like a bunch of murderers!

1531
01:55:39,721 --> 01:55:41,641
- He has a right to do...
- He is dead!

1532
01:55:41,761 --> 01:55:44,801
I don't remember his name,
I don't remember his face, he is dead!

1533
01:55:44,921 --> 01:55:45,801
Barak.

1534
01:55:46,921 --> 01:55:51,361
I have to get to Gan Dafna, now.
That is if you are ready, Mrs. Fremont?

1535
01:55:51,481 --> 01:55:54,841
- You should see it before dark.
- Sorry you have to leave so soon.

1536
01:55:54,961 --> 01:55:57,601
- Maybe I'll wrap your strudel.
- No, don't bother.

1537
01:55:57,721 --> 01:56:01,081
Goodbye, Mrs. Ben Canaan.
And thank you for the good food.

1538
01:56:01,201 --> 01:56:03,081
Bye. I hope you'll come back soon.

1539
01:56:03,201 --> 01:56:05,961
The next time maybe a little hungrier.

1540
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:08,481
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1541
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:19,240
Barak, you should be ashamed of yourself,
in front of a stranger.

1542
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,760
And do you know something else?

1543
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:40,680
I've been elected to the Rooms Committee,
Bungalow 12.

1544
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,040
- Already?
- Yes.

1545
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:45,720
- You remember Edna, the girl with freckles?
- I think so.

1546
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,080
She's helping me with Hebrew,
so I can catch up with the others.

1547
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:52,519
- Hebrew?
- Yes. We have a language of our own now.

1548
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:56,519
And there's something else, too.
When you're 16, you join the Palmach.

1549
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:59,679
They're soldiers, and everybody joins, also girls.

1550
01:57:01,079 --> 01:57:03,559
I didn't show you the statue of Dafna.

1551
01:57:05,959 --> 01:57:07,639
She was a young soldier.

1552
01:57:07,759 --> 01:57:11,799
The Arabs captured her and they tortured her
to find out things from her.

1553
01:57:11,999 --> 01:57:13,319
But she wouldn't tell.

1554
01:57:13,999 --> 01:57:17,839
So they sent her back to Yad El
in a sack tied to the back of a mule.

1555
01:57:18,319 --> 01:57:21,999
They cut off her hands and her feet,
and they gouged out her eyes.

1556
01:57:22,519 --> 01:57:24,679
But she wouldn't tell them anything.

1557
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:28,479
- She was very young.
- Seventeen.

1558
01:57:28,679 --> 01:57:30,959
She and Ari Ben Canaan were in love.

1559
01:57:31,079 --> 01:57:34,238
They grew up together.
They were sweethearts all their lives.

1560
01:57:34,358 --> 01:57:37,918
That's why Ari never got married.
They named the village after her.

1561
01:57:38,838 --> 01:57:40,718
And there's something else, too.

1562
01:57:40,838 --> 01:57:45,238
Dr. Lieberman knows my father.
I mean, he's read my father's books.

1563
01:57:45,358 --> 01:57:47,198
He knows who my father is.

1564
01:57:47,718 --> 01:57:48,758
That's wonderful.

1565
01:57:48,878 --> 01:57:52,638
- We have to go to supper now.
- I'm sorry, I couldn't eat a thing.

1566
01:57:52,878 --> 01:57:56,118
- I had too much at Yad EI.
- Then I'll come back afterwards.

1567
01:57:56,278 --> 01:57:58,758
You're just going to love it here, Kitty.

1568
01:58:52,757 --> 01:58:55,276
What's the matter? You act like a stranger.

1569
01:58:56,436 --> 01:58:57,876
I feel like one.

1570
01:58:58,036 --> 01:59:02,276
I guess I'd feel the same way, too,
if I suddenly found myself in Indiana.

1571
01:59:02,396 --> 01:59:04,356
You just don't understand us yet.

1572
01:59:04,476 --> 01:59:08,116
Stop saying that.
I can understand just as well as you can.

1573
01:59:09,556 --> 01:59:12,516
I didn't come here to fight with you.
I have to get to Jerusalem.

1574
01:59:12,636 --> 01:59:14,436
I came to say goodbye.

1575
01:59:14,596 --> 01:59:15,636
Ari.

1576
01:59:16,476 --> 01:59:17,596
What?

1577
01:59:19,516 --> 01:59:21,796
I had an accident on the road today.

1578
01:59:23,396 --> 01:59:24,916
It wasn't your fault...

1579
01:59:25,916 --> 01:59:28,316
but I'm going to drive more carefully
from now on.

1580
01:59:28,436 --> 01:59:30,476
- You don't really mean that.
- I do.

1581
01:59:31,196 --> 01:59:32,516
You were right.

1582
01:59:33,395 --> 01:59:34,875
We are different.

1583
01:59:35,955 --> 01:59:38,315
I've been feeling the difference all afternoon.

1584
01:59:38,555 --> 01:59:39,595
I feel...

1585
01:59:40,955 --> 01:59:42,275
outside.

1586
01:59:43,835 --> 01:59:45,875
The way your mother and father...

1587
01:59:46,395 --> 01:59:49,675
They were perfectly charming,
I don't mean that, but...

1588
01:59:49,955 --> 01:59:53,835
the way they looked at me,
the way your sister talks to me...

1589
01:59:56,595 --> 02:00:00,035
It doesn't make any sense to discuss it,
no sense at all.

1590
02:00:01,035 --> 02:00:04,555
If it doesn't make any sense to discuss it,
we'll just forget it.

1591
02:00:05,395 --> 02:00:08,715
If I get any word on the girl's father,
I'll let you know. Goodbye.

1592
02:00:09,475 --> 02:00:10,475
Goodbye.

1593
02:00:32,674 --> 02:00:34,834
- Hello.
- Hello. How have you been?

1594
02:00:34,954 --> 02:00:36,874
- Fine, thank you.
- Hello.

1595
02:00:55,073 --> 02:00:59,153
Karen, you do understand
that it's been a long time since you've seen him.

1596
02:00:59,513 --> 02:01:01,873
He may have changed so much,
you won't recognize him.

1597
02:01:01,993 --> 02:01:04,193
- I'll recognize him.
- Good.

1598
02:01:25,793 --> 02:01:27,353
- Doctor?
- Yes?

1599
02:01:27,993 --> 02:01:29,513
- Dr. Engel, Mrs. Fremont.
- Good day.

1600
02:01:29,633 --> 02:01:31,593
- And Karen.
- How do you do?

1601
02:01:31,713 --> 02:01:35,552
- The young lady understands, does she not?
- Yes, we told her everything.

1602
02:01:35,672 --> 02:01:37,792
That's good. I'll just be a moment.

1603
02:03:17,950 --> 02:03:19,110
He's tired.

1604
02:03:47,749 --> 02:03:49,549
The King David Hotel.

1605
02:04:51,028 --> 02:04:54,428
Able Baker 2. Message. Over.

1606
02:05:01,707 --> 02:05:03,707
Able Baker 5.

1607
02:05:03,827 --> 02:05:07,187
Code word, "Nelson." Out.

1608
02:05:58,586 --> 02:06:00,066
The whole of the south wing...

1609
02:06:00,186 --> 02:06:02,986
of the King David Hotel
has been completely destroyed.

1610
02:06:03,106 --> 02:06:07,146
Eighty-three bodies have been recovered so far,
and the search continues.

1611
02:06:07,746 --> 02:06:10,626
A 9:00 curfew has been ordered for all Jews.

1612
02:06:10,746 --> 02:06:12,466
Stand by for further...

1613
02:06:16,386 --> 02:06:18,145
You have done a good job.

1614
02:06:18,265 --> 02:06:20,865
They were given three warnings,
and they laughed.

1615
02:06:21,145 --> 02:06:24,825
If they want their own people slaughtered,
we will oblige them.

1616
02:06:25,385 --> 02:06:26,945
Let's get you some food.

1617
02:06:27,065 --> 02:06:28,705
First I must wash up.

1618
02:06:31,065 --> 02:06:32,505
150 wounded British...

1619
02:07:12,824 --> 02:07:14,744
The fire is now under control.

1620
02:07:15,264 --> 02:07:17,744
The number of dead has risen to 91.

1621
02:07:20,264 --> 02:07:22,544
Hands up! You're under arrest!

1622
02:07:23,424 --> 02:07:24,384
Get up.

1623
02:08:31,302 --> 02:08:32,982
Sergeant, you take on the door.

1624
02:08:34,502 --> 02:08:36,662
You and you search the grounds.

1625
02:08:37,302 --> 02:08:38,782
You round the back.

1626
02:08:38,902 --> 02:08:40,302
You come with me.

1627
02:08:57,102 --> 02:08:58,742
You look in the cupboards.

1628
02:08:59,661 --> 02:09:01,141
You stay here.

1629
02:10:34,579 --> 02:10:36,059
We'll find him.

1630
02:10:36,979 --> 02:10:39,139
He can't have left the compound.

1631
02:10:44,179 --> 02:10:47,859
The Military Court of Jerusalem
has found Akiva Ben Canaan...

1632
02:10:47,979 --> 02:10:50,259
Benno Bronstein and Ludwig Zimmer...

1633
02:10:50,579 --> 02:10:54,579
guilty according to Section 58
of the emergency regulations of 1946.

1634
02:10:56,019 --> 02:10:59,499
They will be transported forthwith
to the military prison of Acre.

1635
02:11:00,259 --> 02:11:04,658
There, two weeks from date of sentence,
they shall be hanged by the neck until dead.

1636
02:11:06,418 --> 02:11:08,658
May God have mercy on your souls.

1637
02:11:23,938 --> 02:11:25,538
Get him ready, sir?

1638
02:11:42,737 --> 02:11:44,937
Akiva Ben Canaan. Visitor.

1639
02:11:52,497 --> 02:11:53,937
Communication centre.

1640
02:11:55,977 --> 02:11:58,257
You have? I'll take it down. Hold on.

1641
02:11:58,417 --> 02:12:00,017
Barak Ben Canaan.

1642
02:13:28,695 --> 02:13:31,055
God, don't let my brother die...

1643
02:13:31,695 --> 02:13:33,735
at the end of a British rope.

1644
02:14:41,613 --> 02:14:43,053
- Shalom.
- Shalom.

1645
02:14:44,173 --> 02:14:46,133
I thought you were on Cyprus, David Ben Ami.

1646
02:14:46,253 --> 02:14:47,973
I've been called back.

1647
02:14:48,093 --> 02:14:50,013
You shouldn't have brought them here, Yoav.

1648
02:14:50,133 --> 02:14:53,893
You not only risk our lives,
the Druze here in this village trust us.

1649
02:14:54,013 --> 02:14:57,813
There's danger not only from the British,
the Arabs will slaughter the village.

1650
02:14:57,933 --> 02:15:00,693
He insisted on talking to you, and I have orders...

1651
02:15:00,813 --> 02:15:03,852
from Akiva that Ari Ben Canaan
may see us any time he wants to.

1652
02:15:05,132 --> 02:15:07,652
Well, you're here. What do you want?

1653
02:15:08,492 --> 02:15:11,252
The UN may vote on Partition
by the end of the month.

1654
02:15:11,372 --> 02:15:12,852
We listen to the radio also.

1655
02:15:12,972 --> 02:15:15,772
Half the leadership of Irgun
and 40 members of Haganah...

1656
02:15:15,892 --> 02:15:19,612
are rotting down there in Acre prison.
- Including Akiva, your uncle. So?

1657
02:15:19,732 --> 02:15:22,972
If Partition is voted,
we'll need every man to fight the Arabs.

1658
02:15:23,092 --> 02:15:25,132
Irgun, Haganah, what difference does it make?

1659
02:15:25,292 --> 02:15:28,492
I spent 14 months in that prison.
I know every inch. I can show you...

1660
02:15:28,612 --> 02:15:31,092
That town is surrounded
by 10,000 British soldiers.

1661
02:15:31,212 --> 02:15:34,212
8,400. 1,600 are pulling out tomorrow
for Jerusalem.

1662
02:15:34,332 --> 02:15:36,132
Acre isn't a prison, it's a fortress.

1663
02:15:36,252 --> 02:15:38,652
It hasn't been successfully attacked
since the Crusades.

1664
02:15:38,772 --> 02:15:42,932
He picks a place in the middle of an Arab city,
surrounded by the British Army...

1665
02:15:43,052 --> 02:15:44,571
and says to us, "Go fight."

1666
02:15:44,691 --> 02:15:46,811
Napoleon bombarded it for 61 days.

1667
02:15:46,931 --> 02:15:49,411
Napoleon didn't have 93 men inside. You have.

1668
02:15:49,531 --> 02:15:53,811
- What about the 400 Arabs in that prison?
- We waste Irgun blood to free Arabs?

1669
02:15:53,931 --> 02:15:58,051
If you turn 400 Arabs loose, they are going
to run in 400 different directions.

1670
02:15:58,171 --> 02:16:00,731
Each'll have a detachment
of British soldiers on his tail.

1671
02:16:00,851 --> 02:16:03,651
I will not listen.
I do not trust anybody from the Haganah.

1672
02:16:03,771 --> 02:16:08,251
If we can't trust each other,
there'll be no Israel, even if Partition is voted.

1673
02:16:08,851 --> 02:16:11,811
Akiva is Ben Canaan's own blood.
This is no trap.

1674
02:16:12,771 --> 02:16:14,851
How many Irgun does your plan call for?

1675
02:16:14,971 --> 02:16:17,491
Twenty-six, divided into four attack groups...

1676
02:16:18,131 --> 02:16:21,011
- and Dov Landau.
- What do you want with Dov Landau?

1677
02:16:21,131 --> 02:16:22,931
Akiva's execution is six days away.

1678
02:16:23,051 --> 02:16:25,610
We need a man inside Acre prison
by tomorrow night.

1679
02:16:25,730 --> 02:16:28,530
- Landau must surrender now.
- He'll be sentenced to death.

1680
02:16:28,650 --> 02:16:30,810
Akiva is your uncle. Why don't you surrender?

1681
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:33,490
Because Landau will be sentenced
within a few hours...

1682
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:36,210
and sent to Acre.
It'd take weeks for me or anyone else.

1683
02:16:36,330 --> 02:16:37,410
It must be Landau.

1684
02:16:37,530 --> 02:16:40,770
If we can agree on a plan,
and if Dov is necessary...

1685
02:16:40,890 --> 02:16:43,890
and if we can find him,
I will give him the choice.

1686
02:16:44,330 --> 02:16:46,250
But I will not order him to do it.

1687
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:48,570
Please, tell us what you have in mind.

1688
02:16:56,450 --> 02:16:58,490
Stars are British command posts.

1689
02:16:58,610 --> 02:17:02,050
Numbers are outside detachments.
Letters are inside groups.

1690
02:17:02,890 --> 02:17:05,929
There is a Turkish bath house
that adjoins the south prison wall.

1691
02:17:06,049 --> 02:17:07,729
Hammam al-Pasha, I know it.

1692
02:17:07,849 --> 02:17:11,729
I'll take a man to the first detachment.
You occupy the baths, move to the roof...

1693
02:17:11,849 --> 02:17:13,729
and dynamite the prison wall here.

1694
02:17:13,849 --> 02:17:16,729
Inside groups will move against the yard
and the cell gates.

1695
02:17:16,849 --> 02:17:18,729
- With what?
- Anything we can smuggle in.

1696
02:17:18,849 --> 02:17:20,729
Dynamite, gunpowder, grenades.

1697
02:17:20,929 --> 02:17:25,009
Now, we move into action simultaneously
from the outside and from the inside.

1698
02:17:56,328 --> 02:17:57,568
Hey, Moshe!

1699
02:19:09,126 --> 02:19:10,806
Peretz Dresner.

1700
02:19:29,086 --> 02:19:30,686
Mrs. Peretz Dresner?

1701
02:19:43,726 --> 02:19:45,885
- Is everything in order?
- Okay, Chief.

1702
02:21:40,083 --> 02:21:41,083
Coberg.

1703
02:21:43,643 --> 02:21:45,043
Cohen.

1704
02:21:48,642 --> 02:21:49,962
Morris.

1705
02:22:15,562 --> 02:22:17,162
- Feuerstein.
- Here.

1706
02:22:18,282 --> 02:22:19,522
- Misra.
- Yes.

1707
02:22:20,602 --> 02:22:22,482
Bach.

1708
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:39,480
Sorry. Bedtime.

1709
02:29:31,191 --> 02:29:32,511
All right, Bill.

1710
02:29:33,951 --> 02:29:35,471
Good boy. On time.

1711
02:29:50,871 --> 02:29:52,190
Stand back!

1712
02:31:11,949 --> 02:31:13,708
Everybody down. Flat.

1713
02:32:09,387 --> 02:32:11,467
Someone placed a fuse. Come on, in here.

1714
02:32:23,947 --> 02:32:26,187
Come on, start climbing.

1715
02:33:15,265 --> 02:33:17,105
...the present moment stands at 15 dead...

1716
02:33:17,225 --> 02:33:21,345
with 251 prisoners still at large,
including all of the condemned terrorists.

1717
02:33:22,065 --> 02:33:25,185
A network of roadblocks
has been set up throughout Palestine...

1718
02:33:25,305 --> 02:33:27,905
while a house-to-house search
is now under way...

1719
02:33:28,025 --> 02:33:30,665
in Acre and neighbouring Druze villages.

1720
02:33:30,905 --> 02:33:34,265
A 7:00 curfew has been proclaimed for Jews.

1721
02:33:34,385 --> 02:33:36,865
Standby for further bulletins.

1722
02:33:48,985 --> 02:33:50,065
Get down.

1723
02:34:19,984 --> 02:34:21,224
Is Akiva hit?

1724
02:34:21,504 --> 02:34:22,864
We are both hit.

1725
02:34:23,264 --> 02:34:26,184
- Do you want me to slow down?
- No, you must go faster.

1726
02:34:26,304 --> 02:34:27,704
Get off the road.

1727
02:35:19,702 --> 02:35:20,982
Is the pain bad?

1728
02:35:22,382 --> 02:35:24,182
Mortal wounds give no pain.

1729
02:35:25,582 --> 02:35:27,902
I'm already occupied with dying.

1730
02:35:28,662 --> 02:35:30,662
Not for a long time, Uncle Akiva.

1731
02:35:32,942 --> 02:35:36,302
In this fatal optimism, you are Haganah.

1732
02:35:37,422 --> 02:35:39,582
In methodology, you are Irgun.

1733
02:35:40,902 --> 02:35:42,982
But in the heart, you are Israel.

1734
02:35:45,542 --> 02:35:47,142
Kiss Barak for me.

1735
02:35:57,461 --> 02:36:00,301
We must get out of here before they come back.

1736
02:36:10,461 --> 02:36:12,621
- Are you hurt badly?
- No, I'm all right.

1737
02:36:12,741 --> 02:36:14,341
Give me your handkerchief.

1738
02:36:17,741 --> 02:36:20,901
You head for Ein Or.
I can get to Gan Dafna from here.

1739
02:36:21,021 --> 02:36:23,381
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure. Shalom.

1740
02:36:49,180 --> 02:36:52,780
A bulletin. 22 residents
of the Druze village of Isfiya...

1741
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:57,500
have been arrested for alleged complicity
in today's prison revolt at Acre.

1742
02:36:58,060 --> 02:37:00,300
Stand by for further bulletins.

1743
02:37:20,099 --> 02:37:21,339
A bulletin.

1744
02:37:21,499 --> 02:37:25,179
The commandant of Acre Prison
has discovered evidence indicating...

1745
02:37:25,299 --> 02:37:28,339
that the surrender
of the notorious Dov Landau...

1746
02:37:28,539 --> 02:37:33,299
was part of the Irgun plot
to organize the uprising from the inside.

1747
02:37:34,659 --> 02:37:37,339
Security police are reported
closing in on Landau...

1748
02:37:37,459 --> 02:37:40,139
along the southern approaches to Haifa.

1749
02:37:40,619 --> 02:37:42,779
Stand by for further bulletins.

1750
02:37:48,779 --> 02:37:50,059
Quiet, please.

1751
02:37:51,659 --> 02:37:53,539
I have an announcement.

1752
02:37:55,459 --> 02:37:58,418
Arabs from across the border
have been infiltrating the valley...

1753
02:37:58,538 --> 02:38:02,178
for the last three or four nights.
There have been two ambushes.

1754
02:38:02,418 --> 02:38:06,338
From now on, no one will leave the village area
without permission.

1755
02:38:25,098 --> 02:38:26,778
Don't worry about Dov.

1756
02:38:26,898 --> 02:38:29,778
If anybody in this world
can give them the slip, he'll do it.

1757
02:38:29,898 --> 02:38:32,298
I know. They'll never catch him.

1758
02:38:33,218 --> 02:38:36,258
But I just keep thinking
how scared he must be right now.

1759
02:38:36,938 --> 02:38:39,977
- Dov?
- Why, yes. He gets so scared.

1760
02:38:40,497 --> 02:38:43,137
Why, inside, he's just scared all the time.

1761
02:38:44,617 --> 02:38:48,577
You know, perhaps later on,
we'll be able to get Dov to America, too.

1762
02:38:50,657 --> 02:38:51,577
Kitty.

1763
02:38:53,297 --> 02:38:55,537
I cannot go to America with you.

1764
02:38:55,977 --> 02:38:57,137
I must stay here.

1765
02:38:57,257 --> 02:38:58,377
Mrs. Fremont.

1766
02:38:58,497 --> 02:39:02,737
Will you come to the hospital right away?
It's an emergency. Please, hurry.

1767
02:39:14,537 --> 02:39:18,296
A British search party has just turned
Yad El upside down. Mother telephoned.

1768
02:39:18,456 --> 02:39:21,616
- They must be coming here next.
- We're almost finished.

1769
02:39:22,056 --> 02:39:23,976
We must get him out of here.

1770
02:39:24,256 --> 02:39:25,976
His right lung is punctured.

1771
02:39:26,096 --> 02:39:30,656
If he's moved, the chances are 8 to 10
he'll haemorrhage, and that would mean death.

1772
02:39:31,496 --> 02:39:35,856
Of course, you're his sister, Jordana.
It's for you to decide.

1773
02:40:20,095 --> 02:40:22,415
No stranger has been here.

1774
02:40:22,895 --> 02:40:26,615
However, everything is open to you.
We are happy to accommodate.

1775
02:40:48,334 --> 02:40:49,694
Sir. Mr. Coats.

1776
02:40:57,614 --> 02:41:01,694
- Quite an arsenal they've got piled up here.
- Pretty little collection.

1777
02:41:06,494 --> 02:41:07,614
What's wrong?

1778
02:41:07,974 --> 02:41:10,574
Nothing's wrong, but you must lie still.

1779
02:41:12,854 --> 02:41:14,894
But I'm the only doctor they had.

1780
02:41:15,014 --> 02:41:18,054
You can't leave all these children
without a doctor.

1781
02:41:29,093 --> 02:41:31,813
Don't worry, children, I'll be back.

1782
02:42:00,452 --> 02:42:02,292
Dr. Lieberman's been arrested.

1783
02:42:02,412 --> 02:42:04,252
They found weapons in Gan Dafna.

1784
02:42:04,372 --> 02:42:07,052
Here's the adrenalin, they have no plasma.

1785
02:42:07,172 --> 02:42:08,212
How is he?

1786
02:42:08,932 --> 02:42:11,172
I opened the wound. It's draining.

1787
02:42:11,292 --> 02:42:12,452
Will he live?

1788
02:42:13,252 --> 02:42:14,492
I don't know.

1789
02:42:15,092 --> 02:42:16,852
His temperature's 102.

1790
02:42:17,052 --> 02:42:20,092
If it keeps going down,
we may have the infection checked.

1791
02:42:21,092 --> 02:42:25,052
If not, it means it's spreading
and forming pockets all through the chest cavity.

1792
02:42:25,172 --> 02:42:28,492
When the Syrian Arabs murdered my father
in his own mosque...

1793
02:42:32,852 --> 02:42:36,252
Ari's father saved my life and my heritage.

1794
02:42:37,412 --> 02:42:39,812
Ari and I used to live together in Yad EI.

1795
02:42:39,932 --> 02:42:41,451
We shared the same room.

1796
02:42:41,771 --> 02:42:43,811
To me, his house was life itself.

1797
02:42:45,891 --> 02:42:47,291
Now to think that...

1798
02:42:48,491 --> 02:42:50,531
my house may become his tomb.

1799
02:42:50,731 --> 02:42:52,531
I can't find his pulse.

1800
02:45:24,327 --> 02:45:25,847
Norway votes...

1801
02:45:26,967 --> 02:45:28,847
for Partition.

1802
02:45:29,927 --> 02:45:31,207
Pakistan...

1803
02:45:32,367 --> 02:45:33,247
against.

1804
02:45:33,367 --> 02:45:35,207
- Who cares?
- How is it now?

1805
02:45:35,327 --> 02:45:38,407
24 for Partition, 9 against, and 8 abstaining.

1806
02:45:38,527 --> 02:45:40,527
If we get over the next 4, I think we're in.

1807
02:45:40,647 --> 02:45:42,367
Republic of Panama...

1808
02:45:44,287 --> 02:45:45,287
for.

1809
02:46:04,446 --> 02:46:06,686
The Republic of Paraguay...

1810
02:46:07,006 --> 02:46:08,366
votes...

1811
02:46:10,006 --> 02:46:11,406
for Partition.

1812
02:46:15,286 --> 02:46:17,126
The Republic of Peru...

1813
02:46:18,446 --> 02:46:19,566
for.

1814
02:46:20,486 --> 02:46:23,246
The Philippine Republic votes...

1815
02:46:24,766 --> 02:46:25,686
for.

1816
02:46:26,566 --> 02:46:29,086
We've got two-thirds. I'm going to announce it!

1817
02:46:29,206 --> 02:46:32,726
- But we haven't got the final vote yet.
- What's the difference? We won!

1818
02:46:32,846 --> 02:46:35,206
The Polish People's Republic votes...

1819
02:46:35,326 --> 02:46:36,726
for.

1820
02:46:45,405 --> 02:46:49,445
Although the vote is not yet complete,
I can now tell you...

1821
02:46:50,525 --> 02:46:53,925
that in 5 months and 16 days
from this moment...

1822
02:46:54,445 --> 02:46:55,885
on May 15...

1823
02:46:56,485 --> 02:46:57,885
1948...

1824
02:46:58,325 --> 02:47:01,765
the British will leave Palestine forever!

1825
02:47:30,764 --> 02:47:34,124
Please, don't make a demonstration yet.

1826
02:47:35,004 --> 02:47:39,044
Because I've still to read this statement
from the National Committee.

1827
02:47:40,204 --> 02:47:44,924
"The final vote of the United Nations
on the question of the Partition of Palestine...

1828
02:47:45,404 --> 02:47:50,004
"...into an independent Jewish state
and an independent Arab state...

1829
02:47:50,844 --> 02:47:52,404
"...is as follows:

1830
02:47:52,884 --> 02:47:54,844
"33 for...

1831
02:47:55,284 --> 02:47:58,604
"...13 against, 10 abstentions."

1832
02:48:13,123 --> 02:48:16,843
We would wish the hour of parting between us...

1833
02:48:17,563 --> 02:48:18,923
and England...

1834
02:48:19,643 --> 02:48:21,323
to be one of honour.

1835
02:48:22,643 --> 02:48:25,123
We must record that in most instances...

1836
02:48:25,243 --> 02:48:29,083
British soldiers carried out
the unrelenting policy of their government...

1837
02:48:29,203 --> 02:48:31,443
with tact and compassion.

1838
02:48:32,403 --> 02:48:36,083
There are many cases on record
of British soldiers and sailors...

1839
02:48:36,203 --> 02:48:39,483
risking their lives to save Jewish refugees.

1840
02:48:40,043 --> 02:48:44,722
And to the Arab population of Jewish Palestine,
we make the following appeal:

1841
02:48:45,362 --> 02:48:49,642
The Grand Mufti has asked you
either to annihilate the Jewish population...

1842
02:48:49,962 --> 02:48:53,162
or to abandon your homes and your lands...

1843
02:48:53,682 --> 02:48:56,482
and to seek the weary path of exile.

1844
02:48:57,402 --> 02:48:59,722
We implore you...

1845
02:49:01,082 --> 02:49:03,322
remain in your homes...

1846
02:49:03,562 --> 02:49:05,282
and in your shops...

1847
02:49:06,482 --> 02:49:10,042
and we shall work together as equals...

1848
02:49:10,362 --> 02:49:13,522
in the free state of Israel!

1849
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:06,160
What's wrong?

1850
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:12,720
- You've won your freedom. I've lost mine.
- We never had freedom, you or I.

1851
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:17,480
All our lives we've been under British rule.
We'll be equal in the free state of Israel.

1852
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:19,440
The resolution guarantees it.

1853
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:22,480
Guarantees are one thing, reality's another.

1854
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:25,280
They've made my lands and village part of Israel...

1855
02:50:25,400 --> 02:50:27,840
These are still your lands. They always will be.

1856
02:50:27,960 --> 02:50:29,400
I'm a minority.

1857
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:32,440
We've always been friends in this valley, Taha.

1858
02:50:32,560 --> 02:50:35,400
Minority, majority,
we've proved it makes no difference.

1859
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:40,080
If it makes no difference,
why have you fought so hard?

1860
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:43,960
Because we had hundreds of thousands
of people with no other place to go.

1861
02:50:44,440 --> 02:50:46,959
- Where shall my people go?
- Why should they go anywhere?

1862
02:50:47,079 --> 02:50:49,039
This is their home as well as ours.

1863
02:50:49,159 --> 02:50:52,959
Don't you see? We have to prove to the world
that we can get along together.

1864
02:50:53,079 --> 02:50:57,239
If we don't, then the British are right,
we cannot govern ourselves without them.

1865
02:51:05,759 --> 02:51:07,039
Excuse me.

1866
02:51:11,239 --> 02:51:14,999
All our lives we've understood each other
and loved each other.

1867
02:51:15,119 --> 02:51:18,359
Now, when it means everything, I can't reach him.

1868
02:51:19,439 --> 02:51:22,879
You'll make him understand, Ari. I know you will.

1869
02:51:24,199 --> 02:51:25,958
You know, you're wonderful.

1870
02:51:26,198 --> 02:51:27,198
I look at you...

1871
02:51:27,318 --> 02:51:31,398
and I ask myself, what are you doing here
in the middle of somebody else's fight?

1872
02:51:31,518 --> 02:51:34,758
You should go back to America.
You've had your civil war.

1873
02:51:37,478 --> 02:51:39,118
I'm going to stay.

1874
02:51:41,158 --> 02:51:43,958
I'm going to stay as long as you'll have me.

1875
02:51:45,718 --> 02:51:47,238
I love you, Kitty.

1876
02:51:49,078 --> 02:51:51,678
My father gave them the land
upon which Gan Dafna stands.

1877
02:51:51,798 --> 02:51:53,918
My children go to school at Gan Dafna.

1878
02:51:54,038 --> 02:51:56,438
I am the mukhtar of this village
and will not attack.

1879
02:51:56,558 --> 02:51:57,958
We know you are the mukhtar.

1880
02:51:58,238 --> 02:52:01,118
Understand the Grand Mufti
has publicly committed himself...

1881
02:52:01,238 --> 02:52:03,918
and every Arab man, woman and child to die...

1882
02:52:04,038 --> 02:52:06,917
rather than accept the partitioning of Palestine.

1883
02:52:07,237 --> 02:52:10,677
His Holiness does not recognize
the decision of a few elderly gentlemen...

1884
02:52:10,797 --> 02:52:14,077
at Flushing Meadows,
who call themselves the United Nations.

1885
02:52:14,197 --> 02:52:16,357
As you are a Moslem,
you cannot recognize it either.

1886
02:52:16,477 --> 02:52:21,117
- What does this have to do with attacking?
- Gan Dafna commands the Jezreel valley.

1887
02:52:21,237 --> 02:52:24,117
The Mufti must pass through this valley
on his way to Safed.

1888
02:52:24,277 --> 02:52:28,997
He's made Safed his provisional capital
until the last Jew is exterminated.

1889
02:52:29,677 --> 02:52:32,997
- There are 650,000 Jews in Palestine.
- Temporarily.

1890
02:52:33,837 --> 02:52:36,797
The Grand Mufti was our guest in Berlin
during the war.

1891
02:52:36,917 --> 02:52:39,517
Since I and my group of friends
are now his guests...

1892
02:52:39,637 --> 02:52:43,757
we have placed our experience
in handling Jews entirely at his disposal.

1893
02:52:43,877 --> 02:52:46,836
I have 80 Arab storm troopers in my command.

1894
02:52:48,276 --> 02:52:52,356
You will supply 300 men
by tomorrow at midnight to join them.

1895
02:52:52,836 --> 02:52:54,396
We will give you the arms.

1896
02:52:54,516 --> 02:52:56,956
My people are shepherds and farmers,
not fighters.

1897
02:52:57,076 --> 02:53:00,676
The 80 men of whom I spoke
were trained by myself, personally.

1898
02:53:01,076 --> 02:53:03,836
They will see that your villagers fight like lions.

1899
02:53:04,276 --> 02:53:07,516
I'm leaving three of my officers
and six of my men behind...

1900
02:53:07,636 --> 02:53:10,236
to assist you in gathering your forces together.

1901
02:53:10,716 --> 02:53:13,956
My village is just as well situated
to control the valley as Gan Dafna.

1902
02:53:14,076 --> 02:53:16,796
Must we slaughter defenceless children
for what we don't need?

1903
02:53:16,916 --> 02:53:19,996
We've chosen Gan Dafna
because we want a quick victory.

1904
02:53:20,116 --> 02:53:21,436
I'm not going to take chances.

1905
02:53:21,556 --> 02:53:23,396
Well, you must now excuse me.

1906
02:53:23,516 --> 02:53:27,755
I have to deliver a message from the Mufti
to the British commander at Fort Esther.

1907
02:53:27,875 --> 02:53:30,955
I'm travelling under a flag of truce.
I shall return later.

1908
02:53:31,115 --> 02:53:33,075
We'll be your guests tonight.

1909
02:53:33,875 --> 02:53:36,155
I understand you have other guests in the house.

1910
02:53:36,275 --> 02:53:38,795
- A Jewish couple.
- The woman is an American.

1911
02:53:38,915 --> 02:53:42,515
See to it that they are here when I return.
I wish to interrogate them.

1912
02:53:42,635 --> 02:53:43,755
Personally.

1913
02:54:15,954 --> 02:54:19,114
- Ari, you must leave here right away.
- Why?

1914
02:54:19,274 --> 02:54:21,514
Don't ask why. Leave. Don't let anyone see you.

1915
02:54:21,634 --> 02:54:24,074
- Go through the olive grove.
- What happened?

1916
02:54:24,194 --> 02:54:26,314
You must evacuate Gan Dafna
by midnight tomorrow.

1917
02:54:26,434 --> 02:54:28,994
- I don't understand.
- Don't ask questions, just do it.

1918
02:54:29,114 --> 02:54:32,634
If the children aren't out of this valley,
they will be butchered like sheep.

1919
02:54:32,754 --> 02:54:36,434
If the Mufti's men are in the house
or if they're attacking Gan Dafna, tell me.

1920
02:54:36,554 --> 02:54:38,074
Haven't I told you enough already?

1921
02:54:38,194 --> 02:54:40,314
Do you want me to dishonour myself completely?

1922
02:54:40,434 --> 02:54:41,594
Goodbye.

1923
02:54:41,954 --> 02:54:44,554
They're the same gangsters
who murdered your father.

1924
02:54:44,674 --> 02:54:47,873
- You can't get involved with them.
- Ari, I know what I'm doing.

1925
02:54:47,993 --> 02:54:49,273
We grew up as brothers.

1926
02:54:49,393 --> 02:54:52,713
If there's trouble with the Mufti,
let's face it together, as always.

1927
02:54:52,833 --> 02:54:54,073
I'll get word to the Palmach.

1928
02:54:54,193 --> 02:54:57,273
We'll defend Abu Yesha and Gan Dafna
instead of surrendering them.

1929
02:54:57,393 --> 02:54:58,833
I cannot do it.

1930
02:54:58,953 --> 02:55:01,993
Today, more than ever before,
I realize that I'm a Moslem.

1931
02:55:02,113 --> 02:55:05,473
I cannot go against my own people.
I cannot kill another Arab.

1932
02:55:06,193 --> 02:55:09,673
If you were ever my friend,
prove it now by leaving this house.

1933
02:55:14,193 --> 02:55:17,033
May Allah watch over you all the days of your life.

1934
02:56:06,192 --> 02:56:08,032
- Who goes?
- Dov Landau.

1935
02:56:19,031 --> 02:56:21,351
I knew they wouldn't catch you.

1936
02:56:21,871 --> 02:56:23,751
- Who's in charge?
- Jordana Ben Canaan.

1937
02:56:23,871 --> 02:56:24,991
Only, she isn't here now.

1938
02:56:25,111 --> 02:56:27,871
She went to Fort Esther
to try to make them give our guns back.

1939
02:56:27,991 --> 02:56:31,271
- Have you got headquarters set up here?
- In the dining hall.

1940
02:56:32,271 --> 02:56:35,791
Don't hold a Molotov like that.
Here, hold it like this.

1941
02:56:40,831 --> 02:56:43,351
We've less than 100 heavy machine guns
in the country.

1942
02:56:43,471 --> 02:56:46,391
Most of our ammunition
isn't accurate beyond 100 yards.

1943
02:56:46,511 --> 02:56:48,950
Now, the Palmach have about 6,000 other arms...

1944
02:56:49,070 --> 02:56:51,190
and the Irgun, another 1,500.

1945
02:56:52,350 --> 02:56:55,270
- From now on, we work together.
- Something coming through.

1946
02:56:57,630 --> 02:56:59,390
Haganah Safed calling.

1947
02:57:00,270 --> 02:57:03,910
"We've had an Arab uprising in progress
since sundown.

1948
02:57:04,910 --> 02:57:06,670
"We have 40 rifles...

1949
02:57:07,470 --> 02:57:09,030
"...42 homemade Stens...

1950
02:57:09,550 --> 02:57:11,670
"...one machine gun and one mortar...

1951
02:57:11,790 --> 02:57:13,510
"...plus handmade grenades.

1952
02:57:14,390 --> 02:57:16,990
"We still hold the centre of the city...

1953
02:57:17,550 --> 02:57:19,910
"...but we're heavily outnumbered."

1954
02:57:21,910 --> 02:57:24,470
- Ari, how are you?
- I'm fine.

1955
02:57:24,750 --> 02:57:26,710
- How many guns have you got?
- Eight.

1956
02:57:26,830 --> 02:57:29,789
And about 180 Molotovs.
The British confiscated the rest.

1957
02:57:29,909 --> 02:57:30,909
I know. I heard.

1958
02:57:31,029 --> 02:57:33,389
Jordana went to Fort Esther
to try to get them back.

1959
02:57:33,509 --> 02:57:35,669
There's a detachment of Palmachs on the way.

1960
02:57:35,789 --> 02:57:38,829
But the Jerusalem road has been cut
in a dozen places.

1961
02:57:38,949 --> 02:57:40,749
I sneaked ahead to let you know.

1962
02:57:41,549 --> 02:57:45,309
The order is for every kibbutz and moshav
and village to fight to the end.

1963
02:57:45,429 --> 02:57:47,349
Nothing's to be surrendered.

1964
02:57:51,149 --> 02:57:52,789
- Is the transmitter working?
- Yes.

1965
02:57:52,909 --> 02:57:54,269
Then send this:

1966
02:57:55,709 --> 02:57:59,429
"Gan Dafna expects an attack in force
by tomorrow night.

1967
02:57:59,829 --> 02:58:02,389
"If the Palmach is on the way, tell them to hurry.

1968
02:58:02,509 --> 02:58:04,909
"We have 300 children here and eight guns."

1969
02:58:05,029 --> 02:58:06,229
That's all.

1970
02:58:07,389 --> 02:58:09,029
Keep on sending that.

1971
02:58:12,988 --> 02:58:15,508
The commander refuses to return our weapons.

1972
02:58:15,628 --> 02:58:17,868
He said it would only provoke violence.

1973
02:58:18,348 --> 02:58:22,308
And he won't interfere in local problems,
except to punish troublemakers.

1974
02:58:22,428 --> 02:58:25,148
I suppose that means us,
if we try to defend ourselves.

1975
02:58:25,268 --> 02:58:28,428
They must know that
the whole border's alive with armed Arabs.

1976
02:58:29,708 --> 02:58:32,468
I think the Mufti's men have
taken over Abu Yesha.

1977
02:58:33,988 --> 02:58:37,468
Taha warned us to evacuate here
before midnight tomorrow.

1978
02:58:40,908 --> 02:58:43,628
How many children do we have here under 13?

1979
02:58:43,748 --> 02:58:45,148
About 150.

1980
02:58:47,388 --> 02:58:49,628
We'll have to get them to Beth Amal tonight...

1981
02:58:49,748 --> 02:58:51,667
and secretly, so the Arabs don't know.

1982
02:58:51,787 --> 02:58:53,907
We'll go around the valley instead of through it.

1983
02:58:54,027 --> 02:58:56,187
That's near the border, but we must risk it.

1984
02:58:56,307 --> 02:59:00,387
We'll go through Ein Or
and down the other side of Mount Tabor.

1985
02:59:00,507 --> 02:59:03,827
You can't go down the other side of Tabor
in daytime, much less at night.

1986
02:59:03,947 --> 02:59:05,707
You'll kill half of them.

1987
02:59:06,347 --> 02:59:09,067
I'd rather lose half of them there
than all of them here.

1988
02:59:09,387 --> 02:59:11,027
With luck we'll be back by sunrise.

1989
02:59:11,147 --> 02:59:14,227
That means the older children
must handle things until we get back.

1990
02:59:14,347 --> 02:59:17,507
- What if they attack tonight?
- That's a risk we'll have to take.

1991
02:59:17,627 --> 02:59:20,947
Dov, you organize outside the fence.
Jordana, you take the inner area.

1992
02:59:21,067 --> 02:59:23,787
Make it look as though
we've got 1,000 people here.

1993
02:59:23,907 --> 02:59:25,467
Let's get to work.

1994
02:59:28,747 --> 02:59:30,547
Get dressed. Hurry up.

1995
02:59:34,946 --> 02:59:37,826
Get up, get dressed. Report to the dining hall.

1996
03:01:29,904 --> 03:01:31,664
Will you help me?

1997
03:01:32,663 --> 03:01:36,223
I want you to stay here.
If anything happens, they'll need a nurse.

1998
03:01:36,343 --> 03:01:39,063
Have you forgotten
every 15-year-old girl in Gan Dafna...

1999
03:01:39,183 --> 03:01:40,543
is a nurse, and a good one?

2000
03:01:40,663 --> 03:01:43,623
Stay here, anyway.
I don't want you mixed up in this.

2001
03:01:44,063 --> 03:01:46,663
Either I'm with you, or I'm not with you.

2002
03:01:46,783 --> 03:01:50,263
This is your choice,
and this is the time to make it, right now.

2003
03:01:53,423 --> 03:01:56,823
All right, you come along, then.
That's a Haganah order.

2004
03:02:21,622 --> 03:02:22,702
Now...

2005
03:02:25,062 --> 03:02:29,102
I want you to walk two by two,
holding hands so that nobody gets lost.

2006
03:02:29,462 --> 03:02:32,262
We're going very close to the border.
So from when we leave...

2007
03:02:32,382 --> 03:02:35,102
until the time we get to Beth Amal,
nobody says a word.

2008
03:02:35,222 --> 03:02:38,502
Nobody coughs, nobody sneezes,
nobody cries, nobody even whispers.

2009
03:02:38,622 --> 03:02:40,062
Do you understand?

2010
03:02:40,182 --> 03:02:41,822
- Will you promise?
- We will.

2011
03:02:41,942 --> 03:02:43,862
- No, say it.
- We promise.

2012
03:02:44,342 --> 03:02:46,862
- Not one word.
- Not one word.

2013
03:06:35,816 --> 03:06:37,816
Mr. Ben Ami, how many men did you bring?

2014
03:06:37,936 --> 03:06:41,216
Only two to a truck,
but from the outside it looks like an army.

2015
03:06:41,336 --> 03:06:42,856
Where is Jordana?

2016
03:06:49,456 --> 03:06:51,856
David! I'm so glad to see you.

2017
03:07:11,655 --> 03:07:14,295
- Halt! Stay where you are.
- It's me, Dov.

2018
03:07:15,335 --> 03:07:16,575
Watch out.

2019
03:07:17,815 --> 03:07:20,855
- What are you doing out here?
- Sixty Palmachniks just came.

2020
03:07:20,975 --> 03:07:23,695
- I know, I heard the trucks.
- So you can come back now.

2021
03:07:23,815 --> 03:07:27,015
No, I don't go back
until somebody relieves me of this position.

2022
03:07:27,135 --> 03:07:28,375
Stay down.

2023
03:07:28,935 --> 03:07:30,215
There are Arabs out there.

2024
03:07:30,335 --> 03:07:33,295
Ari said they won't attack until tomorrow night.

2025
03:07:34,175 --> 03:07:36,534
I killed one about three hours ago.

2026
03:07:37,294 --> 03:07:38,654
Down there.

2027
03:07:40,134 --> 03:07:41,214
Dov...

2028
03:07:41,574 --> 03:07:43,694
you have a beautiful name.

2029
03:07:44,254 --> 03:07:46,534
Sometimes I whisper it to myself.

2030
03:07:51,334 --> 03:07:53,654
- You'd better go back.
- When you do.

2031
03:07:54,214 --> 03:07:57,014
I'm 15 years old now.

2032
03:07:57,814 --> 03:08:01,134
- I'm not little anymore.
- You shouldn't have come here in the first place.

2033
03:08:01,254 --> 03:08:03,694
But, Dov, you're always fighting.

2034
03:08:04,054 --> 03:08:07,134
And you're always in a place
where you might be killed.

2035
03:08:07,254 --> 03:08:11,574
If anything should happen to you
before I told you how much I love you...

2036
03:08:11,694 --> 03:08:14,094
I just wouldn't want to live anymore.

2037
03:08:14,494 --> 03:08:16,173
Please, love me.

2038
03:08:16,693 --> 03:08:18,933
I'm not afraid. Honest, I'm not.

2039
03:08:21,333 --> 03:08:24,333
When things are all over, I'm going to marry you.

2040
03:08:24,933 --> 03:08:26,853
You'll be Mrs. Dov Landau.

2041
03:08:27,813 --> 03:08:29,893
You're going to have respect.

2042
03:08:31,093 --> 03:08:34,773
- They will tip their hats when you go by.
- And I will smile.

2043
03:08:41,013 --> 03:08:43,573
- I told you to go back twice already.
- Dov!

2044
03:08:43,693 --> 03:08:46,333
From now on, you do what I say.
You understand?

2045
03:08:47,093 --> 03:08:48,493
Now, keep down.

2046
03:08:53,573 --> 03:08:56,213
Be careful. Take cover wherever you can.

2047
03:09:55,571 --> 03:09:57,691
Shalom, Dov. I've come to relieve you.

2048
03:09:57,811 --> 03:09:59,291
- Is Ari back?
- Yes.

2049
03:09:59,411 --> 03:10:01,851
He got the children safely to Beth Amal.

2050
03:10:01,971 --> 03:10:05,011
It's been very quiet the last few hours. Shalom.

2051
03:10:05,131 --> 03:10:06,291
Shalom.

2052
03:10:19,930 --> 03:10:22,410
We are going to attack Abu Yesha
before they move.

2053
03:10:22,530 --> 03:10:25,010
Good. We'll never be stronger
than we are right now.

2054
03:10:25,130 --> 03:10:28,210
- Have you seen Karen?
- I sent them all to bed hours ago.

2055
03:10:28,330 --> 03:10:31,370
- What's my assignment?
- Patrol Gan Dafna while we move out.

2056
03:10:31,490 --> 03:10:34,370
Let's be sure they don't surprise us
while we surprise them.

2057
03:10:34,490 --> 03:10:35,970
David will jump them from behind...

2058
03:10:36,090 --> 03:10:39,170
and my group will attack
directly through the olive grove.

2059
03:10:41,210 --> 03:10:44,210
David, you'd better take Jordana with you,
she knows the village.

2060
03:11:03,889 --> 03:11:06,009
Nothing seems to be moving over there.

2061
03:11:06,129 --> 03:11:09,009
The muezzin hasn't called
for the morning prayers, either.

2062
03:11:10,449 --> 03:11:11,609
Cover us.

2063
03:12:36,207 --> 03:12:38,407
Somebody come and help me cut him down.

2064
03:13:07,246 --> 03:13:08,806
What's the matter?

2065
03:14:56,204 --> 03:14:57,524
This is Taha...

2066
03:14:59,084 --> 03:15:00,963
mukhtar of Abu Yesha.

2067
03:15:02,283 --> 03:15:03,923
And this is Karen...

2068
03:15:05,763 --> 03:15:09,323
Secretary of the Rooms Committee,
Bungalow 12, Gan Dafna.

2069
03:15:10,563 --> 03:15:12,203
We have no kadi...

2070
03:15:12,843 --> 03:15:14,843
to pray for Taha's soul.

2071
03:15:15,203 --> 03:15:17,003
And we have no rabbi...

2072
03:15:17,483 --> 03:15:19,243
to pray over Karen.

2073
03:15:21,003 --> 03:15:23,443
Taha should have lived a long life...

2074
03:15:24,003 --> 03:15:26,803
surrounded by his people and his sons.

2075
03:15:29,123 --> 03:15:31,203
And death should have come to him...

2076
03:15:31,883 --> 03:15:33,643
as an old friend...

2077
03:15:33,923 --> 03:15:36,043
offering the gift of sleep.

2078
03:15:37,283 --> 03:15:39,363
It came, instead, as a maniac.

2079
03:15:39,843 --> 03:15:42,242
And Karen, who loved her life...

2080
03:15:43,202 --> 03:15:46,962
and who lived it as purely as a flame,
why did God forget her?

2081
03:15:47,082 --> 03:15:50,002
Why did she have to stumble
onto death so young?

2082
03:15:50,842 --> 03:15:52,242
And all alone?

2083
03:15:53,322 --> 03:15:54,842
And in the dark?

2084
03:15:56,922 --> 03:15:58,482
We of all people...

2085
03:15:58,602 --> 03:16:02,242
should no longer be surprised
when death reaches out to us.

2086
03:16:02,482 --> 03:16:06,042
With the world's insanity
and our own slaughtered millions...

2087
03:16:06,922 --> 03:16:09,602
we should be used to senseless killing.

2088
03:16:09,722 --> 03:16:13,202
But I am not used to it.
I cannot and will not get used to it.

2089
03:16:13,322 --> 03:16:17,042
I look at these two people,
and I want to howl like a dog.

2090
03:16:18,162 --> 03:16:19,882
I want to shout "murder"...

2091
03:16:20,522 --> 03:16:23,641
so that the whole world will hear it
and never forget it.

2092
03:16:25,801 --> 03:16:29,481
It's right that these two people
should lie side by side in this grave...

2093
03:16:29,601 --> 03:16:31,761
because they will share it in peace.

2094
03:16:32,841 --> 03:16:35,481
But the dead always share the earth in peace.

2095
03:16:35,601 --> 03:16:39,161
And that's not enough.
It's time for the living to have a turn.

2096
03:16:39,881 --> 03:16:42,321
A few miles from here,
people are fighting and dying...

2097
03:16:42,441 --> 03:16:45,041
and we must join them. But I swear...

2098
03:16:45,161 --> 03:16:47,721
on the bodies of these two people...

2099
03:16:48,361 --> 03:16:51,481
that the day will come
when Arab and Jew will share...

2100
03:16:51,601 --> 03:16:53,481
in a peaceful life...

2101
03:16:54,121 --> 03:16:57,201
this land that they have always shared in death.

2102
03:17:01,760 --> 03:17:03,400
Taha, old friend...

2103
03:17:05,600 --> 03:17:07,480
and very dear brother.

2104
03:17:09,400 --> 03:17:10,560
Karen...

2105
03:17:12,520 --> 03:17:14,200
child of light...

2106
03:17:16,760 --> 03:17:18,360
daughter of Israel...

2107
03:17:21,760 --> 03:17:23,040
Shalom.
