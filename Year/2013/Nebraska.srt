1
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,732
Hey, partner.

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,073
Hold on there, just a second.

3
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,880
Where are you headed, there?

4
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,879
Where are you headed up to?

5
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,684
How are you doing there, bud?

6
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,690
Huh? Are you okay?
Where are you headed?

7
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,248
You headed down the road, there, huh?

8
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,520
Huh?

9
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,358
Where are you coming from?

10
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,697
Yeah?

11
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,564
There he is.

12
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,133
Thank you.

13
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,714
Well, there's the man of the hour.

14
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,547
The what?

15
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,556
The man of the hour.

16
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,752
I... I don't know.

17
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:41,032
So, you told the sheriff
that you were walking to Nebraska?

18
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,865
That's right.

19
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,096
To get my million dollars.

20
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,769
What million dollars?

21
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,080
"We are now authorized to
pay one million dollars

22
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,552
"to Woodrow T. Grant
of Billings, Montana."

23
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,021
Let me see that.

24
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,356
And your mother won't take me.

25
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,917
"Mega Sweepstakes Marketing."

26
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,360
Dad, this is a total come-on.

27
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,093
It's... It's one
of the oldest gimmicks in the book.

28
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,031
I didn't even know
they still did it anymore.

29
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,070
Well, they can't say it if it's not true.

30
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,629
They're just trying to
sell you magazines.

31
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,767
It says I won.

32
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,538
So, mail it in.
I'll help you.

33
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,204
I'm not trusting the mail
with a million dollars.

34
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,732
You dumb cluck.

35
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,437
You pretty near gave me a heart attack!

36
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,570
Just cool your jets.

37
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,809
This is the second time
he's tried to sneak out.

38
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,575
I never knew the son of a bitch

39
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,950
even wanted to be a millionaire.

40
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,818
He should have
thought about that years ago

41
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,584
and worked for it.

42
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,629
What would you do with
a million dollars anyway, Dad?

43
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,431
Buy a new truck.

44
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,835
You can't drive.

45
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,929
I'll get my license back.

46
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,771
Tell me when you do,
so I can stay off the road.

47
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,169
I need an air compressor, too.

48
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,508
Are you still harping on that?

49
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,310
Ed Pegram still has mine.

50
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,180
That's because he's a thief.

51
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,684
He's not a thief.

52
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,015
I lent it to him.

53
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,782
Who's Ed Pegram?

54
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,016
A guy I knew back in Hawthorne.

55
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,717
And when did he borrow it?

56
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,294
'74.

57
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,860
That's almost 40 years.

58
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,454
He lives two states away.

59
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,295
I'd say he stole it.

60
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,167
That's why I need a new one.

61
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,205
Where are you off to now?

62
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,966
Sitting down.

63
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,965
He even sleeps
with that stupid letter.

64
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,375
He's memorized it word for word.

65
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,640
I didn't think he could
memorize anything anymore.

66
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,719
Hey, what's with this casserole?

67
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,087
Oh, it's lasagna.
It's still good, take it.

68
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,392
You know what I'd do
with a million dollars?

69
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,863
I'd put him in a home.

70
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,421
But that's not to say
that I can't set you up

71
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,124
with a whole lot more
reasonable speakers

72
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,462
that'll still blow your mind

73
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,593
if you're worried that
the Wilsons or Paradigms

74
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,296
are going to set you back too much.

75
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,203
You know, the way they
design speakers anymore...

76
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,208
You can't make a mistake.

77
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,971
Okay.

78
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,973
All right, well, yeah, let's...

79
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,571
We need to discuss it
and we'll get back to you.

80
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,911
- Oh.
- I'll let you know.

81
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,111
Let me, uh, give you a card.

82
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,578
Give me a call any time
if you have any more questions.

83
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,815
- All right, thank you.
Excellent.

84
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,390
Mark, Janice, a pleasure.

85
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,447
"Janice."

86
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,390
"Janice." Sorry.

87
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,128
<i>David. Call, line one.</i>

88
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,597
<i>David Grant. Call, line one.</i>

89
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,807
Where did they find him this time?

90
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:52,645
Way the hell out
on King Avenue by the Albertsons.

91
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,785
I can't take it anymore.

92
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:58,186
Ross is in there, trying to talk
some sense into him.

93
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,116
Ross.

94
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,423
Hi, David.

95
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,463
What's going on, Dad?

96
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,261
Ask Ma and Ross.

97
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,669
They seem to know it all.

98
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,260
I'm asking you.

99
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,837
Can't get her to turn over.

100
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,833
That's because ifs been
sitting there for 10 years.

101
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,275
Oh, I'll get it running.

102
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,473
He still thinks
he's going to Lincoln to get his money.

103
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,310
Hey, Dad, how come you didn't

104
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,444
fix the truck first or take a bus?

105
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,488
Why did you just start walking?

106
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,619
Don't pull his chain like that.

107
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,718
The poor guy doesn't
know what's going on half the time.

108
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,989
I cut the solenoid wire
and stuck it back in

109
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,725
so that'll slow him down.

110
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,630
And Mom's right.
It's time to think about a home.

111
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,068
She can't
handle him anymore. It's not fair to her.

112
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,161
No. He doesn't need a nursing home.

113
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,232
He just...
The guy just needs something to live for.

114
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,639
That's all this is about.

115
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,645
Yeah, and it's pathetic.

116
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,507
Seems like drinking always gave him

117
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,981
more than enough to live for until now.

118
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,814
Mom and I are looking at reality,

119
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,478
and you'd better start, too.

120
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,579
A home is in his best interests.

121
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,679
Which, let's face it,
is a hell of a lot more

122
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,918
than he ever thought about with us.

123
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,324
He never gave a shit about you or me.

124
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,027
I saw you anchoring the other night.

125
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,036
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

126
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,502
It's your first time in the chair, right?

127
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,165
Yeah, Kelly Ann Castillo called in sick,

128
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,435
so they let me fill in.

129
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,343
And apparently I didn't
stink the place up too bad, so...

130
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,178
Tom Brokaw.

131
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,281
The new Tom Brokaw of Billings.

132
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,353
I don't know
about "Tom Brokaw" exactly,

133
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,547
but, yeah, ifs looking pretty good.

134
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,680
I've paid my dues.

135
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,124
Plus, Kelly Ann's got
a pretty bad infection, so...

136
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,461
<i>Bu! opponents,</i>

137
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,194
<i>led by Councilman Barry Tilden,</i>

138
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,069
<i>claim the plan is
a "Pie in the Big Sky idea"</i>

139
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,201
<i>that will cost taxpayers
more than it's worth.</i>

140
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,040
<i>The Council is expected

141
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,081
<i>In Monday's session.</i>

142
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,909
<i>Coming up next, in sports...</i>

143
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,282
<i>Carter brings us the story
of a Hardin snowmobiler</i>

144
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,719
<i>who may have lost his legs,
but not his will to compete.</i>

145
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,786
<i>That, and more,
after the break. Stay with us.</i>

146
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,728
Hi.

147
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,399
Are you moving back in?

148
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,305
No, these are yours.
I'm just returning them.

149
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,138
Oh, right. Thanks.

150
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,512
You want to come in?

151
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,458
David, you need to water these plants.

152
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,158
These are plants.

153
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,476
I'd like you to change your mind.

154
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,617
What does that mean?

155
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,891
You know what it means.
I want you to move back in.

156
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,358
But I just moved out.

157
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,021
So, two years and we're back to dating?

158
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,467
I don't know yet.
We'll find out in a while.

159
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,040
Are we still having sex?

160
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,808
I've got to go.

161
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,873
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Come on.

162
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,878
Are you saying that we
can't be together again

163
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,414
unless we get married?

164
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,849
Get married, break up...
I don't know.

165
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,419
Let's do both.
Let's... Let's do something.

166
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,386
<i>Pick up or call me back,</i>

167
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,926
- right now.
- Shit.

168
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,927
<i>I don't know what
I'm going to do with him.</i>

169
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,429
<i>I'm going to put him in a...</i>

170
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,193
Hi, Mom. I'm here.

171
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,016
Dad.

172
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,912
Dad!

173
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,685
Leave me alone.

174
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,531
Come on, let me take you home.

175
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,804
I'm going to Lincoln
if it's the last thing I do.

176
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,708
I don't care what you people think.

177
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,714
Listen to me. You didn't win anything.

178
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,215
It's a complete scam.

179
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,444
So you've got to stop this, okay?

180
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,280
I'm running out of time.

181
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,820
You don't even have a suitcase.

182
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,286
I'm not staying there.

183
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,721
Dad.

184
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,053
I can't let you go.

185
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,422
It's none of your business.

186
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,393
Yes, it is. I'm your son.

187
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,327
Well, then why don't you take me?

188
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,625
I can't just drop everything

189
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,256
and drive to Lincoln, Nebraska.

190
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,494
Oh.

191
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,627
What else you got going on?

192
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,735
Have you lost your marbles, too?

193
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,176
Get your father out of your car

194
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,181
this goddamned instant.

195
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,010
You need to help me.

196
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,754
I'm the one who does
all the work around here.

197
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,654
Your father just sits there.

198
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,623
Look at him. He's useless.

199
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:36,922
His mother spoiled him.

200
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,656
Mom, don't worry, okay?

201
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,492
We'll only be gone a couple of days.

202
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,497
Why don't you just enjoy the time alone?

203
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,534
You always complain
about having him around.

204
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,103
What about your job?

205
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,832
Well, I told them I was sick.

206
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,338
Sick in the head.

207
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,204
I'm going to tell Ross to call you.

208
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,435
He'll back me up.

209
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,500
Right. Sounds great. Bye, Mom.

210
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,142
You're just like your father.

211
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,718
Stubborn as a mule!

212
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,803
Let me know when you
get tired. I'll drive.

213
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,973
You can't drive.

214
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,712
I can drive a hell of a lot better
than that moron.

215
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,546
All right, Dad.

216
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,883
I can drive a hell of a lot better
than that moron.

217
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,783
Shit.

218
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,279
Jesus Christ, Dad,
what are you doing here?

219
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,648
Oh.

220
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,313
I got thirsty.

221
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,856
Well, good to see you're not drinking.

222
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,825
Beer ain't "drinking."

223
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,995
Let's go.

224
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,715
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

225
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,980
How about we go see Mount Rushmore?

226
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,913
We don't have time for that.

227
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,855
It's just 30 minutes off the Interstate.

228
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,325
We're right here.

229
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,658
It's just a bunch of rocks.

230
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,608
So, what do you think, Dad?

231
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,904
It doesn't look finished to me.

232
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,444
How do you mean?

233
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,515
Well, looks like somebody
got bored doing it.

234
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,346
Washington's the only one
with any clothes,

235
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,182
and they're just kind of roughed in.

236
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,385
Lincoln doesn't even have an ear.

237
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,926
Okay, we've seen it.

238
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,401
Dad?

239
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,166
Dad?

240
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,780
Come here.
Oh, Jesus.

241
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,420
Oh, Dad.

242
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,822
I'm fine.

243
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,692
Go back to bed.

244
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,825
All right, sir.

245
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,665
Are you hanging with me?

246
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,932
Mmm.

247
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,003
Let me know if I'm hurting you, bud.

248
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,307
Mmm.

249
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,113
Don't worry about it. Almost done.

250
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,526
All right, sir.
That ought to pretty much do it.

251
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,124
You did great.

252
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,838
Give me a second.

253
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,413
Where's my teeth?

254
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,374
You lost your teeth?

255
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,556
Did you leave them at the motel?

256
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,751
No.

257
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,326
The tavern?

258
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,260
I wasn't in no tavern.

259
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,120
Did you leave them
at the place where they serve alcohol

260
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,065
that you don't call a tavern?

261
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,899
Must have been when I fell by the tracks.

262
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,765
Gentlemen,

263
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,775
thank you for your patience.

264
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,573
Considering
it's a pretty bad head wound,

265
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,511
his age, his confusion,

266
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,947
and his history of drinking,

267
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,711
I really think we should
keep him in the hospital

268
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,184
a day or so for observation.

269
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,686
I don't drink.

270
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,416
You hear that, Dad?

271
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,787
We won't be making Lincoln by Friday.

272
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,521
We have until Monday.

273
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,459
We're going to take you back home.

274
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,722
I'm not going home.

275
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,765
No, I can't wait until Monday.

276
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,758
That means I wouldn't be
back at work until Wednesday.

277
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,803
Selling record players.

278
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,739
I won a million dollars.

279
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,599
Congratulations.

280
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,576
That will just about
pay for a day in the hospital.

281
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,744
Dad.

282
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,213
Dad.

283
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,551
Dad.

284
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,118
Hey, I looked,
but I couldn't find your teeth anywhere.

285
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,559
They're by the tracks.

286
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,293
Listen, Mom talked to
Uncle Ray and Aunt Martha,

287
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,733
and they're going to put us up
in Hawthorne over the weekend.

288
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,066
I don't want to go to Hawthorne.

289
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,733
There's no sense going to Lincoln
over the weekend.

290
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,640
I will get you there Monday morning.

291
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,178
Anyway, Aunt Martha said
she'd invite all your brothers over

292
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,305
and have a little get-together on Sunday.

293
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,316
Mom's coming down on the bus,
maybe Ross and Marcie, too.

294
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,612
It'll be nice.

295
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,919
I don't want to go to Hawthorne.

296
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,443
Oh! Okay! Dad, I found it!

297
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,777
Here it is!

298
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,851
Oh, wait. This isn't yours.

299
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,717
I was kidding. Here.

300
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,025
These ain't mine.

301
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,360
Of course they're yours.

302
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,525
No.

303
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,367
Whose else is it going to be?

304
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,369
- See if it fits.
- They're not my teeth.

305
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,530
They have to be.

306
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,665
I ought to know my own teeth.

307
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,074
Of course they're my teeth.

308
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,549
Don't be a moron.

309
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,200
Well, hello there, boys!

310
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,211
- Hey, Aunt Martha.
- Hi.

311
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,309
Woody!

312
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,178
Martha.

313
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,384
Davey!

314
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:15,951
Look at you, Davey.

315
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,619
You couldn't have been more than 15

316
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,162
the last time you were here.

317
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,458
That was what I was saying to Dad.

318
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,362
It's been a long time.

319
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,695
Well, what do you got to
say for yourself, Woody?

320
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,825
Nothing.

321
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,393
What did you do to your head?

322
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:28,631
Fell.

323
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,972
You Grant brothers
sure are men of few words.

324
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,474
Come on in.

325
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,853
Look who I found
hanging around out front, Ray.

326
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,149
Your little brother, Woody.

327
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,224
What's up, Woody?

328
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,256
Nothing.

329
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,063
How about you?

330
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,528
Not much.

331
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,034
Hi, Uncle Ray.

332
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,102
You have a latrine?

333
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,697
Uh, around the corner, to your left.

334
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,406
You boys remember your cousin David?

335
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,113
- Bart.
- Hey.

336
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,873
- Cole.
- Hey.

337
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,586
It's been a long time
since we all met as kids.

338
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,348
What are you guys up to?

339
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,023
Not much.

340
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,218
This economy has just
tore up Hawthorne, Davey.

341
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,020
Things are hard for young men.

342
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,462
Yeah, I'm in the home theater

343
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,897
and electronics business myself.

344
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,265
It's a rough time, I'll tell you that.

345
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,565
Cole, here, did some jail.

346
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,739
Don't bring that up.

347
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,375
Bitch lied through her teeth.

348
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,779
I will not have
that language in my house.

349
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:46,872
Sorry, Mom.

350
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,545
Now, Davey, you sit down.
You must be starving.

351
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,281
I made sandwiches.

352
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,263
So, how long did it take you to get here?

353
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,460
I don't know. Uh...

354
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,763
We got sort of waylaid in Rapid City.

355
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,465
That's where Dad had his little accident.

356
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,565
But how long, total?

357
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,630
Um...

358
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,471
A couple of days, I guess.

359
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,408
- From Billings?
- Yeah.

360
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,969
How far is that?

361
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:20,642
It's probably about, uh, 750 miles.

362
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,511
It took you two days to drive 750 miles?

363
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,489
What were you driving,
a dump truck or something?

364
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,688
It's a Subaru. Outback.

365
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,854
Hell, I drove up from Dallas one time.

366
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,761
That's 850 miles.

367
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,923
I done that in eight hours.

368
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,828
That's, like, over 100 miles an hour.

369
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,871
Oh, Bart was moving.

370
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,307
Here you go, Davey. Dig in.

371
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,538
Thank you.

372
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,778
Shit, two days from Montana.

373
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,044
Son of a bitch must have
been driving in reverse.

374
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,954
Ray's foot's been bothering him.

375
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,999
Ain't that right, Ray?

376
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,964
It's okay. Just hurts.

377
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,502
Did you get that, Dad?

378
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,065
- Dad?
- Huh?

379
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,673
Uncle Ray's foot hurts.

380
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:21,972
I know.

381
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,579
Everything else good, though?

382
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,681
Uncle Ray?

383
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,051
Not really.

384
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,054
Kate says they got Ross
on the news out there.

385
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,683
Says he's doing real good.

386
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,421
Yup. Yeah, he's doing great.

387
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,497
Well, good for him.

388
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,055
He always was a go-getter,
wasn't he?

389
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,225
Yup.

390
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,529
Two goddamn days from Billings!

391
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,340
I used to own this garage.

392
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,950
Own it? I thought
the air compressor guy did.

393
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,245
Ed Pegram?

394
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,581
Yeah, I thought he owned it.

395
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,279
We were partners.

396
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,915
Oh.

397
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,580
What happened?

398
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,248
Sold it to him.

399
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,858
For how much?

400
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,451
$800.

401
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,666
- You need something?
- Oh, hi, yeah.

402
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,833
My dad, here, used to own this place.

403
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,433
Oh, yeah?

404
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,810
What you fellows got going on, here?

405
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,785
Oh, we're just replacing
a transmission cooler line.

406
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,020
- You know Ed Pegram?
- Who?

407
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,455
Ed Pegram.

408
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,515
Used to own this place with me.

409
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,036
We don't know him.

410
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,629
Hey, bud.

411
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,544
You're using the wrong wrench.

412
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,670
Come on, Dad. Let's get going.

413
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,738
Good talking to you.

414
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,541
Moron was
using the wrong wrench.

415
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,319
Let's see if I know anyone in here.

416
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,739
It's pretty quiet in here.

417
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,684
Hi, fellas.
What can I get for you today?

418
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,080
Beer.

419
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,683
Okay, what kind of
beer would you like?

420
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,689
Anything's fine.
Coors, if you got it.

421
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,194
I'll have a Mountain Dew.

422
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,756
Okay, we're out of Coors.

423
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,233
The truck doesn't come in until Monday.

424
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,731
Bud's good.

425
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,773
Bud and a Dew, coming up.

426
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,034
Tom Varnik still own this place?

427
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,304
I don't remember that name.

428
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,877
It must have been before my time.

429
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,612
Here we go, guys.

430
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,389
Anything else I can get
for you right now?

431
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,412
No, ma'am.

432
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,652
Okay, holler if you need something.

433
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,060
I used to know everyone in here.

434
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,326
It's where you had your first drink?

435
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,627
No.

436
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,066
Dad used to let me sip his beer.

437
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,660
So, I guess you kept up that

438
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,400
fine family tradition with Ross and me.

439
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,766
You liked it, as I recall.

440
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,571
I was, like, six.

441
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,775
A sip of beer ain't going to kill you

442
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,441
when you're six years old.

443
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,246
I thought you drank.

444
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,786
Come on.
Have a beer with your old man.

445
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,822
Be somebody.

446
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,753
I've been trying to give it up.

447
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:05,989
What for?

448
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,588
It was starting to...

449
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,497
It just wasn't helping.

450
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,925
And now you're all right.

451
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,667
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

452
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,437
Can I have a beer, too, please?

453
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,604
You betcha.

454
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,943
I'm going to drink with my dad.

455
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,706
I didn't tell you that
Noel and I broke up.

456
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,208
Who?

457
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,475
Noel.

458
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,049
The girl I've been living with
for the past two years.

459
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,516
She moved out.
We broke up.

460
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,485
Oh.

461
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,826
Maybe I should have
asked her to get married. I don't know.

462
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,191
I just...

463
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,492
I just never felt sure,
you know what I mean?

464
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,941
How are you supposed to know
when you're sure?

465
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,339
Were you sure?

466
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,503
Huh?

467
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,610
How did you and Mom
end up getting married?

468
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,211
Oh, she wanted to.

469
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,877
And you didn't?

470
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,886
I figured, what the hell.

471
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,788
Were you ever sorry
you married her?

472
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,554
All the time.

473
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,362
Could have been worse.

474
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,860
You must have been in love.
At least, at first.

475
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,094
Never came up.

476
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,910
Did you ever talk
about having kids?

477
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,949
How many you wanted
and stuff like that?

478
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,482
Nope.

479
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,047
Then why did you have us?

480
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,115
Because I like to screw.

481
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,587
And your mother is a Catholic.

482
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,556
So, you figure it out.

483
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,285
So, you and Mom never
actually talked about

484
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,158
whether you wanted kids or not?

485
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,958
I figured if we kept on screwing,

486
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,465
we would end up with a couple of you.

487
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,334
Did you ever think
about leaving her?

488
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,498
Oh, I would just end up
with somebody else

489
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,303
who would give me shit all the time.

490
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,968
Yeah, you would.

491
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,473
Yeah.

492
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:39,674
I'd say she's put up
with your drinking all these years.

493
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,579
I don't drink that much.

494
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,953
- You're an alcoholic.
- Bullshit.

495
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,421
Oh, what do you mean, "bullshit"?

496
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,822
I knew you had a problem
when I was eight.

497
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,257
I used to watch you hide
your booze in the garage.

498
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,422
Yeah, you stole it, too.
I figured it was you.

499
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,599
You cost me a lot of money.

500
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,826
Yeah, I poured it out

501
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,164
because I was sick
of seeing you drunk all the time.

502
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,294
I figured it was you.

503
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,361
You would never catch your brother

504
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,372
sneaking around like that.

505
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,204
I served my country.

506
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,005
I Pay my taxes.

507
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:10,674
And I got a right to do

508
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,806
whatever the goddamn hell I want.

509
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,612
So, I guess you do drink.

510
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,283
- A little bit.
- A lot.

511
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,950
All right.

512
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,455
So, I drink a lot!

513
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,514
God damn it, so what?

514
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,117
You do what you want to do, and so do I.

515
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,695
You would drink, too, if you were
married to your mother.

516
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,563
And it ain't your job
to tell me what to do,

517
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,330
you little cocksucker.

518
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:44,807
Dad.

519
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,040
Dad.

520
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,874
Dad!

521
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,316
What?

522
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:56,348
Should I take you back
to Ray and Martha's?

523
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:58,426
I don't know.

524
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,434
Say, don't you
owe me a couple of bucks?

525
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,881
Christ Almighty, it's Woody Grant.

526
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,410
I don't believe it!
How the hell are you, Woody?

527
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,647
God, I never thought
I'd see you back in Hawthorne.

528
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,821
Fellas, say hello to my
old friend Woody.

529
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,262
Hello, Woody.

530
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,328
Yeah!

531
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,297
Move over. Move over.
Sit down, sit down.

532
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,801
I don't believe this.
Jesus Christ, Woody.

533
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,234
So, how you been?

534
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,971
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

535
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,064
Me, too. I can't complain.

536
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,801
Boy, it's been a long time, Woody.

537
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,073
A long time.

538
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,411
Hi, I'm David, Woody's son.

539
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,006
Oh. Ed Pegram.

540
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,683
Ed Pegram?

541
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,184
Davey? Oh, no shit.

542
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,317
How you doing, guy?

543
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,756
You know, the last time I saw you,
you was just a little shaver.

544
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,523
I used to give you candy bars
down at the garage

545
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,153
when you were about this high.

546
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,253
Thank you.

547
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,460
And apparently, my dad used to
give you air compressors.

548
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:46,994
How's that?

549
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,193
Nothing.

550
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,170
Hey, Dad,
I'm going to the bathroom.

551
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,207
Don't say
anything about the money.

552
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:53,435
Huh?

553
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,771
Don't say anything about the money.

554
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,672
You still living up in Billings?

555
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:00,943
Yeah.

556
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,985
What brings you down here?

557
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,146
I'm just passing through.

558
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,473
Goddamn, Woody
Grant is a millionaire!

559
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,841
Who would have thought it, huh?

560
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,673
The next round is on Woody.

561
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,001
Come on, Dad.

562
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,916
Did you see the look
on their faces?

563
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,460
Yeah, I saw.

564
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,600
Did you see the look
on those fellas, faces?

565
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,254
Well, good morning, boys.

566
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,458
Slept in a little late, did you?

567
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,590
Morning.

568
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,192
Davey, get yourself
a chair from over there.

569
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:36,200
And Woody, you sit right on down here.

570
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,103
Right there, yeah.

571
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,708
Hungry?

572
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,943
Yeah, but it would be great
if you have some, uh...

573
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,780
Some coffee.

574
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,482
Got a call from
Lowell Meyerson this morning.

575
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,551
And Mary Jurak.

576
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,453
Woody, here,
is the talk of the town.

577
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,731
Is that right?

578
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,995
Why didn't you tell us
you was rich, Woody?

579
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,366
David said not to.

580
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,733
He's not rich.

581
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,634
You could have told us the real reason

582
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,902
you were coming through town.

583
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,806
We're just tickled for you.

584
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,409
You got it on you?

585
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:17,844
Yeah, we sure would like to see

586
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,041
what a million dollars looks like.

587
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,709
We still got to go to Lincoln to get it.

588
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,253
Goddamn, you hit the Powerball!

589
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,152
Whoo!

590
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,188
Show us the ticket, Uncle Woody.

591
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,557
Honestly, he didn't win anything.

592
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,057
I didn't win anything.

593
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:34,596
I don't blame you, Woody.

594
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,926
I wouldn't broadcast it either.

595
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,659
Not until I had it in the bank.

596
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,504
You have to watch out for buzzards, too.

597
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,499
Bart and me, we can drive you.

598
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,564
Sure.

599
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,735
We could get you to Lincoln in an hour.

600
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,779
Lincoln is over 200 miles.

601
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:54,547
Okay, an hour-and-a-half.
How long would it take you?

602
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,254
A day-and-a-half.

603
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:59,016
Must be nice,
winning that kind of scratch.

604
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,516
We're real proud of you, Woody.

605
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:05,419
And I know Ma and Pa
would've been real proud, too.

606
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,798
Hell, yeah, it must be nice.

607
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,561
Is it nice, Dad?

608
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,699
Is what nice?

609
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,706
Winning all that money?

610
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,936
Yeah, pretty nice.

611
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,057
Hey there, Woody. Remember me?

612
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,062
Bernie Bowen, how you doing?

613
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:44,728
Pretty good.

614
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,564
That's what I hear.

615
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,796
Everybody's saying
how Woody Grant's a millionaire.

616
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:53,273
Well, that's the most exciting news
around here for ages!

617
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,774
It's no big deal.

618
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,402
No big deal?

619
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:59,573
Jeez! There's a guy
living the life of Reilly.

620
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,842
A million here, a million there.

621
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,920
Oh, the newspaper's gonna
do a big write-up on you.

622
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:06,745
I'm gonna get my
picture in the paper?

623
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,290
You bet you will.

624
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,082
Dad, here's the bus.

625
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:14,853
Okay. Well, good seeing
you then, Woody.

626
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:16,656
We're all real happy for you

627
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,995
and real pleased you thought
to stop back home

628
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,433
and share the big news.

629
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,970
Thanks, Bernie.

630
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,439
Hey, watch your wallet!

631
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:47,952
Thank you.

632
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,327
You're welcome.

633
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:52,965
You both look like hell.

634
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,059
I'm fine.

635
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:57,332
Like hell, you are.
You look like an old drunk.

636
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,473
You're lucky you're not dead.

637
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,873
I haven't been drinking!

638
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,639
That's what you said on our first date!

639
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,844
And you.
Have you gone bananas?

640
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,709
Almost getting your father killed

641
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,343
over some cockamamie pot of gold.

642
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:13,477
Mom, come here, please.

643
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,021
Mom, look.
Go easy on the guy, okay?

644
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:19,859
I mean, you and I both know

645
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,692
that this is not about the money.

646
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:25,598
It's about, you know, how much
longer is he going to be around?

647
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,499
At least, semi-coherently.

648
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,765
What's the harm in letting
him have his little fantasy

649
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,601
for just a couple more days?

650
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:34,836
You and Ross, always
fretting over your father.

651
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,537
What about me?

652
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:40,112
What about taking me out
to see my sister in Eau Claire?

653
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,081
Your father doesn't
even know what the hell's

654
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:44,346
going on around him half the time.

655
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,944
Do you, Woody?

656
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:47,878
Do I what?

657
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,255
Know what's going on around you?

658
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:55,261
You watch it,
or that's what you're gonna turn into.

659
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:57,399
Now, take me out to the cemetery.

660
00:45:57,455 --> 00:45:59,628
I want to pay my respects.

661
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:01,124
Martha said she'd have lunch ready.

662
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:02,762
Martha can wait.

663
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,035
Mom.

664
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,874
Car's over there.

665
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,103
There's Woody's mother, Sara.

666
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,175
She hated me.

667
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,509
She wanted him to marry someone

668
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,810
who would milk the cows.

669
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,010
I said, "I ain't fiddling
with no cow titties.

670
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,916
"I'm a city girl."

671
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:56,122
The good Lord did not
do Sara any favors

672
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,182
in the looks department.

673
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:01,457
More a man's face
than a woman's, really.

674
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,591
How did she die?

675
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,193
Saw herself in
the mirror one day.

676
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:10,968
No.

677
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:12,468
Cancer!

678
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:16,440
And there's the old Swede, Tolf.

679
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,709
Good man, your grandpa.
Never said much.

680
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,717
That farm just ruined him.

681
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:28,151
You're lucky I took you away from there.

682
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:31,825
And there's Woody's brother, David.

683
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,884
You were named after him.

684
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,828
He died of scarlet fever
when he was only two.

685
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:43,804
Woody slept in the same bed
with him and never got it.

686
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:50,235
There's Woody's little sister, Rose.

687
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,814
She was only 19

688
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,874
when she was killed
in a car wreck near Wausa.

689
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,653
- What a whore.
- Mom...

690
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,815
No, I liked Rose.
But, my God, she was a slut.

691
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:04,820
- Come on.
- I'm just telling you the truth.

692
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:08,760
She was screwing guys
in the back of Hawthorne Creamery

693
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:10,526
when she was only 15.

694
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:12,659
Come on, Mom. Jesus.

695
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,365
Where's your family?

696
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:18,907
Oh. They're over
in the Catholic cemetery.

697
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,737
Catholics wouldn't
be caught dead around

698
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,209
all these damn Lutherans.

699
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,006
Here's Delmer, Woody's cousin.

700
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,244
He was a drunk.

701
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,013
One time, we were wrestling,
and he felt me up.

702
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,617
Grabbed a handful of boob,

703
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,953
and Woody was right there
and didn't have a clue.

704
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,890
- Did you, Woody?
- Jesus, Mom.

705
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:44,860
Well, my goodness.

706
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:48,196
I didn't know Keith White was here.

707
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,697
When did he die?

708
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,106
Keith White.

709
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:57,441
He wanted in my pants,
too, but he was so boring.

710
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,075
See what you could've had, Keith,

711
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,087
if you hadn't talked
about wheat all the lime?

712
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:14,554
Oh!

713
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,228
Peggy Huntsucker is pregnant.

714
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:19,125
Peggy got knocked up again?

715
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:21,225
- Yeah.
- At her age?

716
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,461
That old cow must be 50.

717
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,302
She just looks 50.

718
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,740
That's what pig farming will do to you.

719
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:41,280
So, you got any other cars?

720
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,752
No, just that one.

721
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,586
What's the engine?

722
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,926
It's a four-cylinder.

723
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,599
Yeah, but what size?

724
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,158
Oh, I don't really know.

725
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,502
What's your brother drive?

726
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:58,005
Who, Ross?

727
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,769
Yeah. What does he...
What does he drive?

728
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,275
Ross has a Kia Rondo,

729
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,213
and Marcie has a Nissan Pathfinder,

730
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:09,174
because she carts the kids around a lot.

731
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,942
So, you all got Jap cars?

732
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,989
Actually, Kia is Korean.

733
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,565
Hey, is this where I can
find Mr. Woody Grant?

734
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,464
Who wants to know?

735
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,802
Um, I was sent by Mrs. Nagy

736
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,642
at the <i>Hawthorne Republican</i>
to take his picture.

737
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,211
Yeah, he's here.

738
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,478
And they want him to be sure

739
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,919
to drop by the office for an interview.

740
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,290
Hello?

741
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,059
Hello!

742
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:35,928
Yes?

743
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,630
Hi, are you Mrs. Nagy?

744
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:38,763
Yes.

745
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,069
I'm David Grant, Woody Grant's son.

746
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,374
Oh! I'm very pleased to meet you.

747
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:48,042
Your father is certainly
quite the celebrity around here.

748
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,109
That's what I came to tell you about.

749
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:53,279
Dad didn't win any lottery,
or sweepstakes, or anything.

750
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:56,256
He's a little confused
about something he got in the mail,

751
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,384
and it's gotten way out of hand.

752
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,660
So, he didn't win a million dollars?

753
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,094
No, ma'am.

754
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:05,629
It just goes to show you,
some things never change.

755
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:08,064
He was always a little confused.

756
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,301
Oh. You knew my dad?

757
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,399
It's ancient history now,

758
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,101
and I don't want to speak out of turn,

759
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,906
but Woody and I used to go together.

760
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:18,471
You were his girlfriend?

761
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:20,071
That's right.

762
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,480
What happened?

763
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,677
Your mother is what happened.

764
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,113
How is Kate?

765
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,419
Fine. She's here, too.

766
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:30,081
You tell her Peg Bender says hello.

767
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:32,690
Okay. She won't slap me, will she?

768
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:35,595
Why would she? She won.

769
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,097
It's water under the bridge.

770
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:42,328
Don't get me wrong,
I married a wonderful man.

771
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:45,797
We ran this newspaper
together until he died.

772
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,443
Had three children, eight grandchildren.

773
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,507
I've got no complaints.

774
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,282
Was Woody drinking back then?

775
00:52:56,874 --> 00:53:00,378
Of course he was.
It happens early around here.

776
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,023
There's really not much else to do.

777
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:05,688
Nowadays, of course,
ifs not just the booze,

778
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:07,524
but all the other stuff.

779
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:10,121
For Woody,
it got bad after Korea.

780
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,467
He had a hard time over there.

781
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,659
I thought he was just a mechanic.

782
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:16,966
He was, for the army planes.

783
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,732
But he was shot down,
being transferred.

784
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:22,574
You knew that, right?

785
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:53,507
Thank you.

786
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,515
Oh. Here it is.

787
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,685
- Woody, Ray and Albert.
- Wow!

788
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,467
Wow, they look like kids.

789
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:23,429
Your dad was never much of a talker,

790
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:27,031
and when he came back,
he hardly said a word.

791
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,805
But always very kind.

792
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,074
People took advantage of him.

793
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:34,616
He just couldn't turn down a favor.

794
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,949
Now that everyone thinks
he's a millionaire,

795
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,952
he's a big hero around here.

796
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,649
Well, I'm sorry I can't
print that he is,

797
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,249
but I won't print that he isn't, either.

798
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:48,253
I'll just do a little story
on him and Kate

799
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,127
stopping through town.

800
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,131
It's hard to imagine
you and my mother

801
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,099
fighting over the same man.

802
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:56,229
I knew I didn't have a chance,
anyway.

803
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,397
Yeah?

804
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,964
I wouldn't let him round the bases.

805
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:26,160
You say go slow

806
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,797
<i>I fall behind</i>

807
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,936
What are you having, old man?

808
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,703
Meatloaf.

809
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:36,639
You've been staring at that
menu for 10 minutes.

810
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,139
Where does it say "meatloaf"?

811
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,009
They ought to have meatloaf.

812
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,778
Well, they don't, so pick something else.

813
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,016
Are we ready to order?

814
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,383
Oh, I knew it.

815
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:49,718
Dad, do you know
what you want?

816
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,352
Do you have meatloaf?

817
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:53,894
No, I'm sorry, we don't.

818
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:56,021
That's only on the lunch buffet.

819
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,625
Chicken, then.

820
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:58,962
Do you want the fried chicken,

821
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,298
or the flame-broiled chicken breast?

822
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,964
- Fried.
- He'll have the flame-broiled.

823
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:05,807
And for you, ma'am?

824
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,207
I was thinking about
having the roast beef,

825
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,834
but now I'm not sure.

826
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,540
What do you recommend?
What's good here?

827
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:15,843
It's all good, but I'm kind
of partial to the tilapia.

828
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,542
No, I want the roast beef.

829
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,481
I'll have the tilapia.

830
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:22,984
Don't forget to help yourselves

831
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,389
to the soup and salad bar.

832
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:31,823
<i>On a cold and gray
Chicago morning</i>

833
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,769
<i>A poor little baby child
is born in the ghetto</i>

834
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,602
That's Ed Pegram singing.

835
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,677
<i>And his mamma cries</i>

836
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:47,679
<i>'Cause if there's
one thing that she don't need</i>

837
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,412
<i>It's another hungry
mouth to feed</i>

838
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,214
<i>In the ghetto</i>

839
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:57,522
<i>People don't you understand</i>

840
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,758
He always did have a nice voice.

841
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:03,421
It was the only nice thing
about that bastard.

842
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,591
- He's all right.
- "All right"?

843
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:07,259
Did you know that he was always

844
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,030
trying to get in my bloomers?

845
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,093
Jesus, Mom.

846
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,366
Was the whole town
trying to seduce you?

847
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,965
These boys grow up

848
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:16,874
staring at the rear ends
of cows and pigs.

849
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,777
It's only natural that a real woman

850
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:20,780
will get them chafing their pants.

851
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,282
Mom, please don't talk about

852
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:23,942
that kind of stuff right before we eat.

853
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,887
You were always
such a sensitive boy.

854
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,248
And such a beautiful boy.

855
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,788
Why, when you were a baby,

856
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,624
people used to stop me on the street

857
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:37,221
and tell me how beautiful you were.

858
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,897
A lot of them thought you were a girl.

859
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,830
Isn't that right, Woody?

860
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,504
I don't know.

861
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,901
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

862
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,339
<i>I have an announcement to make.</i>

863
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,070
<i>We have a celebrity
in our midst this evening.</i>

864
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,736
<i>My good friend and the rich man</i>

865
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,644
<i>you've all been hearing about...</i>

866
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:54,443
<i>Mr. Woody Grant!</i>

867
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:55,812
<i>Stand up and take a bow, Woody.</i>

868
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:00,818
- Stand up, Dad.
- Huh?

869
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:03,289
Don't encourage this nonsense.

870
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:05,850
Dad, stand up. Stand up, it's for you.

871
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,156
Just do it and get it over with.

872
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,694
<i>Take a bow, Woody!</i>

873
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,267
<i>Hey!</i>

874
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,148
Okay, you ham, that's enough.

875
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:40,686
<i>Roslyn, you're going to be getting</i>

876
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:43,287
<i>a big tip from that table tonight.</i>

877
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,700
Hey, little Davey!

878
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:52,865
Hello, Mr. Pegram.

879
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,704
I was hoping I'd run into you.

880
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:56,072
Oh, yeah?

881
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:59,074
What can I do for you?

882
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:02,707
I just wanted you to know,
I think the world of Woody.

883
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,747
Always a good man.

884
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:05,842
Thank you.

885
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,411
Heart of gold.

886
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,248
Uh, it's no secret, though...

887
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:12,190
He drank quite a bit
when we had the garage,

888
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:13,819
and he messed up a lot of jobs,

889
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,921
and let lots of money walk.

890
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,493
He was older than me.
Kind of like a big brother.

891
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,536
Korea vet, the whole nine yards.

892
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,003
And I wanted to show
him some respect,

893
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,234
so I loaned him a ton of dough,

894
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:28,240
and I never saw it again.

895
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,075
So, seeing as how
he's come into some cash lately,

896
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,581
some no-fooling-around cash

897
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,673
that he didn't even have to work for...

898
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,552
It seems to me only
fair if we settled up.

899
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,785
So, you want your $800 back.

900
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,855
Woody owes me a lot more than that.

901
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:49,678
I'm sorry to break it to you,

902
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,960
but my dad didn't win anything.

903
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,035
It's all a big misunderstanding.

904
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,594
You know Woody,
you can understand that.

905
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,900
Right, so you're all
headed down to Lincoln

906
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:01,602
to visit the roller skating museum, huh?

907
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,871
Look, Davey,
I really don't want to have

908
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,436
to bring a lawyer into this.

909
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:06,570
Lawyer?

910
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:10,985
What's the statute
of limitations on bullshit?

911
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,782
Davey, Davey.

912
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:18,456
I'm a man with a real strong
sense of right and wrong.

913
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:22,223
And if Woody hit it rich
and I don't see any of it

914
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:24,295
that would be wrong.

915
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:26,834
And I will make it right.

916
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:31,400
Are you threatening my family?

917
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:35,603
Threatening?
No, that would be wrong.

918
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,307
Hey, I'm the victim, here.

919
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,248
It's just food for thought.

920
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:45,948
Now, if you'll excuse me,

921
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,114
I've got to take a leak real bad.

922
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:50,789
You know beer,
you just rent the stuff.

923
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,035
Great to see you again, Woody.
We're real happy for you.

924
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:09,110
Buy a boat and go fishing.
That's what I'd do.

925
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:10,937
I just might.

926
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,714
David, you probably don't remember

927
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:15,840
Kathy and Dale Slaasted.

928
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,480
- Oh, David.
- Hi. How are you?

929
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:19,850
David Grant.

930
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:22,947
I never would've recognized you
in a million years.

931
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,289
You were such a beautiful little boy.

932
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,828
I keep telling him.
You see?

933
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,530
Like a little prince made
out of porcelain.

934
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,621
Thank you.

935
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,395
Well, you all take care.

936
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,333
Oh, and enjoy spending the loot.

937
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:37,030
Enjoy.

938
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,535
I just had an
interesting conversation

939
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,044
with Ed Pegram in the men's room.

940
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:46,341
What did he want?

941
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:47,905
Some of Dad's money.

942
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,914
I can loan him a couple bucks
if he's hard up.

943
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:53,317
Like hell, you will.

944
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,217
Hey, you. Wake up!

945
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,248
Wake up. Now.

946
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:33,055
What's up, Dad? What's wrong?

947
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,255
Are we going to Lincoln today?

948
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,626
Tomorrow.

949
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,256
Why not today?

950
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:41,098
Today is Sunday.
Lincoln is closed.

951
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:44,138
And all your brothers are
coming over today. Remember?

952
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,865
Some of them are dead.

953
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,298
The dead ones won't be here.

954
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,103
Oh.

955
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:52,943
But God damn it.

956
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,208
If I don't get to that money,

957
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,649
they're gonna give it to somebody else.

958
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:00,719
Hey, Dad.

959
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:03,622
Do you remember a gal
you used to go out with

960
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,420
named Peg Bender?

961
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:07,723
- Who?
- Peg Bender.

962
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,297
I don't know. When?

963
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,296
Last week.
What do you mean, "When"?

964
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:14,562
Years ago, before you were married.

965
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,835
It was a long time ago.

966
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,442
What are you bringing that up for?

967
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,144
Snap to Cutler.

968
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:32,948
<i>Back on five, tight pocket.
Throws it over the middle,</i>

969
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,181
batted up in the air by <i>Aromashodu.</i>

970
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,120
<i>He makes the grab
and a first down to midfield.</i>

971
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,659
<i>Left to the 45. Leaping to the 40.</i>

972
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,922
<i>Hit hard from behind
to the Lion 38-yard-line.</i>

973
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,596
<i>Great hands!</i>

974
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,929
<i>Devin Aromashodu batted it to himself,</i>

975
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,832
<i>and it's a first down to the Bears.</i>

976
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,370
I didn't see your boys out there, Martha.

977
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,201
Where are Cole and Ban?

978
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:55,940
Oh, they're out volunteering today.

979
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,844
Picking up trash,
out on the highway.

980
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,676
They'll be home in time for supper.

981
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,010
That's nice.

982
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:05,314
It's community service,
on account of Colds rape.

983
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,115
Sexual assault, not rape.

984
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,483
Well, what's the difference?

985
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,184
There's a big difference.

986
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:13,318
Cole can explain it better than I can.

987
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,021
And Bart doesn't have to be there.

988
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:16,688
He's volunteering.

989
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,390
Oh, that's nice!

990
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:21,469
<i>Bears come
out for their third possession.</i>

991
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,798
Hey, for a limited time,

992
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,840
<i>Ruth's Chris Steak House
is offering Ruth's Classic.</i>

993
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,307
Verne, do you still drive a Chevy?

994
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,673
A what?

995
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:34,240
A Chevy.
That Impala you used to have.

996
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,041
I never had an Impala.

997
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,152
Well, hell, I don't know
what it was, then.

998
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,730
I had a Buick.

999
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,661
That's what it was.

1000
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:54,830
Are you still driving that?

1001
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,030
I haven't had that for years.

1002
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:59,564
I thought you still had it.

1003
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:06,211
It was a '78, wasn't it?

1004
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:07,908
'79.

1005
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,585
'79.
Those were good cars.

1006
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:14,686
It was okay.

1007
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:18,058
They don't make them like that anymore.

1008
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:21,389
Those cars will run forever.

1009
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,597
Whatever happened to it?

1010
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,562
It stopped running.

1011
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,466
Well, they'll do that.

1012
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,139
Hello!

1013
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,607
Come in!

1014
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,476
Oh. Hey, everybody.

1015
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,372
Hi, Ross.

1016
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:44,585
How about Marcie and the kids?

1017
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,310
Uh... Dance recital.

1018
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:50,986
Who's playing?

1019
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,256
Chicago and Detroit.

1020
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,563
How long did it take you to drive?

1021
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,635
So, Uncle Woody, did you get over

1022
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,644
and talk to the newspaper yet?

1023
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:14,412
Not yet.

1024
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,111
They sent a kid around
to take my picture.

1025
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,515
I went by the office
and gave them the lowdown.

1026
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,356
What's it like being
a millionaire, Woody?

1027
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:29,792
It's okay.

1028
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:33,760
A million dollars.
Can you beat that?

1029
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:37,260
Let's raise a glass
to Kate and Woody, here.

1030
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,965
To Kate and Woody!

1031
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:44,172
Not to be a spoilsport,

1032
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:47,180
but you all know this is bull.

1033
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:49,606
I mean, Dad didn't win anything.

1034
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,141
Nice try, Ross.

1035
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,050
Yeah, we're way beyond that.

1036
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,315
Ross is right. He didn't.

1037
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,851
Trying to keep it quiet,
so everybody don't come around

1038
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,052
looking for a handout, huh, Kate?

1039
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,556
That's good thinking.

1040
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:02,857
No, that's right.

1041
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,522
Woody ain't no millionaire yet.

1042
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,498
We all got to remember that.

1043
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:09,503
But come tomorrow,
that's a different story.

1044
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:12,203
What's the first thing you're going to do

1045
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:13,330
with the money, Woody?

1046
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,205
The very first thing.

1047
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,142
Get a truck.
And a compressor.

1048
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:23,314
What the hell are you gonna
do with a compressor?

1049
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,875
I need it to paint.

1050
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:27,250
Are you still working, Woody?

1051
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,546
No.

1052
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:32,684
He just needs to replace the
compressor that Ed Pegram stole.

1053
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:34,660
Why don't you just
go down and get it from him

1054
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,253
while you're in town?

1055
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:37,557
Huh.

1056
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:39,495
David, let's go get it.

1057
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,763
You boys will do no such thing.

1058
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:45,197
Get yourselves shot
for an old piece of garbage?

1059
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,935
Am I the only sane one in this family?

1060
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:50,002
Okay, Mom. Fine.

1061
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,772
But, hey, Ross,

1062
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:53,588
I was thinking we could
take a drive later,

1063
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,081
and see Dad's old house.

1064
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,775
The old Grant house.

1065
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:58,250
Do you think it's still there?

1066
01:07:58,341 --> 01:08:01,686
Dan Conway farms the place,
but he never tore it down.

1067
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:02,946
It's still sitting there.

1068
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:05,890
Why would you want
to waste your time seeing that?

1069
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:08,293
Must be filled with rats.

1070
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,258
Dad, want to take a drive later

1071
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:12,230
and see the old homestead?

1072
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:13,557
The what?

1073
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:16,462
David and I want to go see
where you grew up.

1074
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,300
What for?

1075
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,886
What's Uncle Albert doing?

1076
01:08:42,385 --> 01:08:44,456
He's watching cars go by.

1077
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,928
Remember when they came out
to visit when we were kids,

1078
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,799
and he'd take a chair
out in the front yard

1079
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,098
every evening to watch the road?

1080
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:52,734
Oh, yeah.

1081
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,241
Hi, David. Hi, ROSS.

1082
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,975
It sure is good to see you boys again.

1083
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:02,181
We just can't let
this much time pass again.

1084
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,475
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thanks, Aunt Betty.

1085
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:06,645
It's great seeing you again, too.

1086
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:08,414
But there is something,

1087
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,617
and it's kind of hard to bring up.

1088
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:12,988
We feel it deserves mentioning.

1089
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:14,322
What's that?

1090
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,256
Well...

1091
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,694
Well, you may not know it,

1092
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:21,530
but Woody always had
a lot of money problems,

1093
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,764
and the family would help him out
from time to time.

1094
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:27,665
So, in light of his good fortune...

1095
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,536
Well, we thought your family might want

1096
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:32,670
to make things right.

1097
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,046
I've been hearing that a lot lately.

1098
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:36,708
You know, Cole's and my folks

1099
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:39,548
would never say nothing
if it was just for them,

1100
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,815
but they're gonna need
in on this deal, too.

1101
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:44,381
Are you saying
you want money from us?

1102
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,460
Oh, we just figured, seeing as how

1103
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,689
the family took care of Woody and all,

1104
01:09:48,785 --> 01:09:50,560
and kept him on his feet.

1105
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,690
Verne and I loaned Woody quite a bit,

1106
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,666
and it wasn't like we was rich.

1107
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:56,362
But he was my brother-in-law,

1108
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:58,871
and we couldn't stand
to see the family suffer.

1109
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:00,531
Look, Aunt Betty,

1110
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,975
and, guys, hey,
for real, honestly, right?

1111
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:05,844
Woody didn't win anything.

1112
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:07,677
This is a total sham.

1113
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,645
You're a damn liar!

1114
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,913
Don't feed us any
of your bullshit, Ross.

1115
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:13,817
You want to go?

1116
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:15,716
Let's do it!

1117
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:18,815
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

1118
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:23,224
Hey, watch my face, okay?
I'm on TV.

1119
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,828
Get him, Bart!

1120
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:31,665
What's going on?

1121
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,504
Have you boys lost your minds?

1122
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:39,109
Aunt Betty and her henchmen here
are asking for reparations.

1123
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,269
For what?

1124
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,280
They're after Dad's "winnings." Right?

1125
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,180
They say we owe them money.

1126
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,742
See? There is money.

1127
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:47,253
"Owe them money?

1128
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:50,113
What on Earth are you
talking about, Betty?

1129
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,723
Now, Kate, you know
we helped you and Woody out

1130
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:55,285
when he was drinking up
everything he earned.

1131
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:58,263
You know as well as I do
it was the other way around.

1132
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:01,426
You were always having
him work on your cars for free,

1133
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:02,901
getting free gas.

1134
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:05,963
Aunt Kate, we're not
asking for much. Just a token.

1135
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:07,598
I kept records.

1136
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:09,140
The money you gave him

1137
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:11,644
didn't come close to what you owed.

1138
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,941
He couldn't say "no" to anybody,

1139
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,379
and it ruined him.

1140
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:18,311
I think you're having
a senior moment, here, Kate.

1141
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,250
Just where do you think
that money come from

1142
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:21,947
when you got a bee
in your bonnet

1143
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,650
to move up to Billings
and open up that salon?

1144
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:28,126
From my folks when they croaked,
that's where!

1145
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,231
I don't believe the nerve of you people.

1146
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,960
Usually a person has to die

1147
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,228
before the vultures start circling.

1148
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:38,631
Calm down, Aunt Katie.
We didn't mean nothing by it.

1149
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:40,173
We was just doing you a courtesy

1150
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:42,174
before we go talk to Woody direct.

1151
01:11:42,265 --> 01:11:44,506
Don't you dare think about asking

1152
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,409
that poor man for money.

1153
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,073
He ain't poor.
He's rich.

1154
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,016
Even if he was, he wouldn't
give you a blessed penny.

1155
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,018
I'd put my foot down!

1156
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:55,316
Maybe it ain't up to you,
Aunt Kate.

1157
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,856
That's enough.

1158
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,081
You listen real good.

1159
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:01,584
You can all just go

1160
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,759
fuck yourselves!

1161
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:07,098
Boys, get your dad.

1162
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,091
What do you think, old man?

1163
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:45,893
Looks about the same.

1164
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,599
That's true.

1165
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:50,227
This is about how your mother kept it.

1166
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:56,768
My dad built this place.

1167
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,572
Really?

1168
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,712
Wait. You don't mean,
by himself?

1169
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:04,211
Yeah. Before I was born.

1170
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,983
His brothers helped.

1171
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,255
I got it, I got it.

1172
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,427
This was my room.

1173
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:00,171
That's where
Woody's brother David died.

1174
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,269
Do you remember that, Dad?

1175
01:15:05,935 --> 01:15:07,312
I was there.

1176
01:15:42,505 --> 01:15:44,485
This was my parents' room.

1177
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:49,983
I'd get whipped if they found me in here.

1178
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:56,062
I guess nobody's gonna whip me now.

1179
01:16:08,431 --> 01:16:10,536
The barn is still standing.

1180
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:39,434
Have you seen enough?

1181
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:41,607
I suppose.

1182
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:45,742
It's just a bunch of old wood
and some weeds.

1183
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,612
Did you ever want a farm like your dad?

1184
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:00,919
I don't remember.

1185
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,628
And it doesn't matter.

1186
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,912
Oh, there's the O'Hara farm.

1187
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:28,248
She's dead.

1188
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,813
He's in a nursing home in Valentine.

1189
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:33,951
And one of their little brats
still lives there.

1190
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,100
Oh, and there's Ed Pegram's
place on the right.

1191
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:48,675
What are you doing?

1192
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:50,370
Let's do it.

1193
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,942
We're right here.

1194
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,805
What are you boys up to now?

1195
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,377
Hey, Dad, don't you want to see

1196
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,475
if he still has your compressor?

1197
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,270
Will you two knock off this foolishness?

1198
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:51,459
Hey, Dad, you finally
got your compressor back.

1199
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,397
That's not my compressor.

1200
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,268
Sure it is.

1201
01:19:58,394 --> 01:20:00,465
Mine didn't look anything like that.

1202
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,337
It... It has to be yours.

1203
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:05,344
It's an old compressor
we found in Ed Pegram's barn.

1204
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,841
That wasn't Ed's barn.

1205
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,580
What are you talking about?

1206
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,983
That's the Westendorf place.

1207
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:14,918
Oh, that's right.

1208
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:17,087
Right, the Westendorfs.

1209
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:20,822
The Pegrams live closer to town.

1210
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:23,021
Oh, I got confused.

1211
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:24,990
Ed and his wife Dorothy.

1212
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:26,998
God, what a pig she was.

1213
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:30,362
Anything you want to say
about the Westendorfs?

1214
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:32,370
No, they're good folks.

1215
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,167
They had some tough times.

1216
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,172
They lost a child.

1217
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:38,836
Almost went broke,

1218
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,471
but they worked hard
and saved the farm.

1219
01:20:41,537 --> 01:20:43,710
Salt of the Earth,
the Westendorfs.

1220
01:20:43,806 --> 01:20:47,219
They really didn't deserve
what you boys did to them.

1221
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,384
Dad, why didn't you tell us
that wasn't Ed's house?

1222
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:52,959
I didn't know what the
hell you were doing.

1223
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:55,621
Have you ever seen us
steal machinery before?

1224
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,354
Well, I never know
what you boys are up to.

1225
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:01,157
Well, why didn't you say it wasn't yours?

1226
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,230
I thought you wanted it.

1227
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,737
What do we want an
old compressor for?

1228
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:08,636
That's what I couldn't figure out.

1229
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:22,978
Hi, George.

1230
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:24,546
Hi, Jean.

1231
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:27,376
Remember us?
Kate and Woody Grant?

1232
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,221
Oh, sure. How you doing?

1233
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,780
Just fine.

1234
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:34,326
We were passing by
and thought we'd stop in.

1235
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:37,322
Haven't been in Hawthorne
for a long time.

1236
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,099
Well, what are you doing
in the back seat?

1237
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:42,228
Uh...

1238
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:47,004
We were just resting back here
until you showed up.

1239
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:50,065
You want to come in for a visit?

1240
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:54,437
Sorry, we just have time
to say hi and get going.

1241
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,415
Hi there, Woody.
How you doing?

1242
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:01,287
Good, George.
How about yourself?

1243
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,289
Getting by.

1244
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:05,325
You still up there in Montana?

1245
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:06,415
Yep.

1246
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,961
Billings, isn't it?

1247
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:09,591
That's right.

1248
01:23:09,852 --> 01:23:12,162
You still fixing hair out there, Kate?

1249
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,695
No, I let that go.

1250
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,802
Oh, you did.

1251
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:27,444
Well, good to see you folks.

1252
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:31,012
I'd better get up front
and drive us back to town.

1253
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,386
- It's so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1254
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:36,512
Call us sometime.

1255
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:38,489
I will. Bye-bye.

1256
01:23:53,896 --> 01:23:55,341
Bye-bye.

1257
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,836
You were right, Mom.

1258
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:30,777
The Westendorfs look
like real nice people.

1259
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:32,505
I tried to tell you.

1260
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,911
What do you want to do now,

1261
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,949
bust into a silo and
steal some corn?

1262
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:40,347
- Let me drive.
- No, I'll drive.

1263
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:06,809
What time do you figure
we'll be shoving off in the morning?

1264
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,408
I think 8:00 sounds about right.

1265
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,279
You want another beer?

1266
01:25:12,374 --> 01:25:13,944
I suppose.

1267
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:17,113
Hey there, Davey-boy,
make some room.

1268
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,452
How's it going, cowboy?

1269
01:25:19,548 --> 01:25:21,494
Well, it was going fine.

1270
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:23,554
Woody.

1271
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,393
Ed.

1272
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:28,099
Well, enough of this chit-chat,

1273
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:30,227
ifs time to get down to business.

1274
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,294
Woody, I tried to tell your boy

1275
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:36,467
that you wouldn't mind
using some of your winnings

1276
01:25:36,765 --> 01:25:39,609
to even the score with your old pal Ed.

1277
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:42,281
Well, how much you need?

1278
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:43,907
I got a 20.

1279
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,479
A 20?
No, no, no.

1280
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:49,954
No, no. I was thinking more
along the lines of, say...

1281
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:51,616
10 grand.

1282
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,418
Give him 10 grand, Dad.

1283
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,485
I don't got it yet.

1284
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,654
Woody...

1285
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,462
I always thought we was friends.

1286
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:03,300
Remember, I was the one
that convinced you to stay with Kate.

1287
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:06,496
Oh, yeah, Davey.
Your dad wanted to get a divorce

1288
01:26:06,595 --> 01:26:09,166
because he was screwing
some half-breed down at the reservation.

1289
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:11,039
He thought he was in love.

1290
01:26:11,133 --> 01:26:13,010
Ain't that right, Woody?

1291
01:26:20,442 --> 01:26:22,183
When was this, Dad?

1292
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:24,955
After Ross was born. Before you.

1293
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,741
You know, if I hadn't been around,

1294
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:28,294
you might not even be here.

1295
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:30,455
Back then, divorce was a sin.

1296
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,499
Nowadays, I guess it's okay.

1297
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:35,125
God must have
changed his mind or something.

1298
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,804
Although, I really didn't
blame you, Woody,

1299
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,535
because Kate was... Was always a bitch.

1300
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:45,203
Get the hell away from us.

1301
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,506
I want that money.

1302
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:47,706
Move.

1303
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,841
Okay, little Davey.

1304
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:52,145
Have it your way.

1305
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:55,885
But, uh, this is the last time

1306
01:26:56,178 --> 01:26:58,749
that old Eddie-boy is
gonna play nice.

1307
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:35,522
I got it! I got it!

1308
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,429
Dad, are you okay?

1309
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,431
They took my letter.

1310
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:06,990
Hey, David.

1311
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:08,483
Where is it?

1312
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:09,960
Where's what?

1313
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:11,621
Just give it back.

1314
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:14,496
I don't know what
you're talking about, buddy.

1315
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:15,966
Cole, do you know?

1316
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:17,559
Of course not.

1317
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,505
Where is it?

1318
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,069
We don't got it.

1319
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,908
Shut the fuck up, Cole!

1320
01:28:27,903 --> 01:28:30,907
We tossed it when we saw
how bogus it was.

1321
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:33,510
A millionaire? What a joke.

1322
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:35,281
You people are pathetic.

1323
01:29:03,038 --> 01:29:05,985
I won't mention any of
this to Mom or Ross.

1324
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:09,815
We'll just tell them that
you came to your senses,

1325
01:29:09,878 --> 01:29:11,186
and we'll head back home.

1326
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:12,622
Sound good?

1327
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:15,521
It's okay.

1328
01:29:15,617 --> 01:29:18,029
At least we had
a little change of scenery.

1329
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:21,066
And I'm happy that
we got this time together.

1330
01:29:21,156 --> 01:29:22,499
Aren't you?

1331
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,639
Maybe they dropped it.

1332
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,475
Should we go have a look?

1333
01:29:52,654 --> 01:29:55,191
I think it was easier
to find your teeth.

1334
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,545
Hey, Dad.

1335
01:30:07,836 --> 01:30:09,509
Let's take a break.

1336
01:30:25,687 --> 01:30:27,928
Now, just imagine what you could do

1337
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:31,095
with one million dollars,
Woodrow.

1338
01:30:31,192 --> 01:30:33,194
But we all know what
the son of a bitch would do.

1339
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,537
He'd buy a truck.

1340
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:37,434
Oh.

1341
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:39,409
"To collect your prize

1342
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:40,946
"you just have to return this letter

1343
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:44,609
"to our office, along with
your winning prize number

1344
01:30:44,706 --> 01:30:49,985
"and a list of the magazine
subscriptions you would like."

1345
01:30:50,078 --> 01:30:53,389
Oh, hey there, Woody!
I was just looking for you.

1346
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:55,922
Somebody found your
precious sweepstakes notice

1347
01:30:55,984 --> 01:30:57,395
out on the street.

1348
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,132
You better take better
care of this, Woody.

1349
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,097
You wouldn't want
to lose it again.

1350
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:36,690
Dad, what's the matter?

1351
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:37,889
I'm dizzy.

1352
01:32:37,986 --> 01:32:40,364
Okay. Let's get you to a doctor.
Come on.

1353
01:32:40,822 --> 01:32:42,665
Get me back to the house.

1354
01:32:42,991 --> 01:32:44,527
We're going to Lincoln in the morning.

1355
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:46,094
No, we're not going to Lincoln.

1356
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:47,673
Yes, we are.

1357
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:49,105
No. Come on.

1358
01:32:49,197 --> 01:32:50,938
Let me sit down a minute.

1359
01:32:55,837 --> 01:32:57,009
Okay.

1360
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:04,918
Dad, this is it, okay?

1361
01:33:05,013 --> 01:33:07,050
This is where it stops.

1362
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,892
Your head is busted open,

1363
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:12,056
and now you can barely stand up.

1364
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:13,893
You promised.

1365
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:15,263
You didn't win!

1366
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:17,734
Okay? Can't you get
that through your head?

1367
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:20,295
And we're not driving down to Lincoln

1368
01:33:20,395 --> 01:33:22,272
over a stupid fantasy!

1369
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:25,641
It's my own damn fault
for taking you this far.

1370
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,608
You've got enough money to get by.

1371
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,051
You can't drive.

1372
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:37,113
What's the point?

1373
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,255
I want a new truck.

1374
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:42,554
Why do you need a truck so bad?

1375
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:44,588
Just to have it.

1376
01:33:45,053 --> 01:33:47,397
I always wanted a brand-new truck.

1377
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:49,899
Well, what about the
rest of the money?

1378
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:53,132
You don't need a million dollars
for a damn pickup truck.

1379
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,903
It's for you boys.

1380
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:02,745
I wanted to leave you something.

1381
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,614
We're fine, Dad.

1382
01:34:10,912 --> 01:34:12,482
We don't need it.

1383
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:17,453
I just wanted to leave you something.

1384
01:34:27,095 --> 01:34:31,271
You know if there was
any chance you won, I'd take you.

1385
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:33,268
You know that, right?

1386
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:35,877
I wouldn't lie to you.

1387
01:34:36,271 --> 01:34:37,511
I know.

1388
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:41,619
Look, the only reason
I agreed to take you to Lincoln

1389
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,986
was to get out of Billings for a while,

1390
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:46,457
and maybe have some time with you.

1391
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:48,656
And to get you to shut up.

1392
01:34:50,118 --> 01:34:51,620
All right.

1393
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:53,355
All right, what?

1394
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:55,324
I'll shut up.

1395
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:59,468
And what about Lincoln?

1396
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:03,169
We don't have to go.

1397
01:35:04,132 --> 01:35:05,475
Good.

1398
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,014
Dad! Dad.

1399
01:35:47,008 --> 01:35:48,180
Hey.

1400
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,578
So, they can keep him here

1401
01:35:50,678 --> 01:35:52,885
until tomorrow afternoon or so.

1402
01:35:53,348 --> 01:35:56,386
And then I guess
we'll just start driving home.

1403
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:58,220
We'll probably see you Tuesday night.

1404
01:35:58,286 --> 01:36:00,926
Okay. Thanks, David.

1405
01:36:01,289 --> 01:36:03,064
Mom and I will head out
early tomorrow morning.

1406
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:04,432
I have to get back, so...

1407
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:07,131
And I'm gonna have
to listen to him harp

1408
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:10,437
about losing his fortune
for the rest of his life.

1409
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:12,272
Or my life.

1410
01:36:12,567 --> 01:36:14,911
He's gonna bury me at this rate.

1411
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,461
You big idiot.

1412
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:47,642
You want this open or closed?

1413
01:36:47,735 --> 01:36:49,442
Might as well close it.

1414
01:37:13,194 --> 01:37:14,468
Dad?

1415
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,065
Wait, Dad. Dad.
You can't go in like that.

1416
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:30,302
Come on, you have
to get your robe off.

1417
01:39:30,398 --> 01:39:32,139
Here. Come back here.

1418
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:50,128
Hi. Can I help you?

1419
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:51,288
Hi.

1420
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:54,428
My father is here to
collect his million dollars.

1421
01:39:55,523 --> 01:39:57,434
Dad, give me the letter.

1422
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:20,285
I'm sorry, your number wasn't
one of the winning numbers.

1423
01:40:21,983 --> 01:40:23,792
Looks like you didn't win.

1424
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,330
But it says I won.

1425
01:40:25,386 --> 01:40:27,195
It says you won if your number

1426
01:40:27,288 --> 01:40:29,529
is one of the winning numbers.

1427
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,797
I'm sorry, sir.

1428
01:40:34,061 --> 01:40:36,302
I hope you guys didn't
have to come too far.

1429
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:37,866
Montana.

1430
01:40:37,965 --> 01:40:39,171
Oh, my.

1431
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:43,414
Well, Dad, I guess that's it.

1432
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:47,378
I can give you a free gift,

1433
01:40:47,475 --> 01:40:49,648
like a hat or a seat cushion.

1434
01:40:50,478 --> 01:40:52,549
You want a hat or
a seat cushion?

1435
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:53,981
Huh?

1436
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:57,161
Do you want a hat
or a seat cushion?

1437
01:40:58,719 --> 01:40:59,823
A hat.

1438
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:02,162
He'll take the hat.

1439
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:28,291
Does this happen a lot?

1440
01:41:28,382 --> 01:41:30,760
Yeah. Every once in a while.

1441
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:33,896
Usually older people
like your father.

1442
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:36,435
Does he have Alzheimer's?

1443
01:41:36,524 --> 01:41:39,061
He just believes stuff
that people tell him.

1444
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:41,195
Oh. That's too bad.

1445
01:41:41,629 --> 01:41:42,869
Yeah.

1446
01:41:44,131 --> 01:41:45,633
Thank you.

1447
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:00,586
Dad?

1448
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:02,788
Dad.

1449
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:06,064
I'm here.

1450
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:09,264
We're going back
to Billings, okay?

1451
01:42:09,323 --> 01:42:10,563
Okay.

1452
01:42:18,933 --> 01:42:22,073
We might make
a couple quick stops first.

1453
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:24,139
Whatever you want.

1454
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:53,043
I don't understand
what's happening with your car.

1455
01:42:53,801 --> 01:42:57,613
Well, they made me
a real good offer for it.

1456
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:02,218
It's not much of a car.

1457
01:43:02,543 --> 01:43:05,353
Yeah, this truck is a real step up.

1458
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:09,119
It's only five years old.
It's practically brand-new.

1459
01:43:11,819 --> 01:43:14,390
Oh, and I hope you don't mind...

1460
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:18,527
I put your name on the title.

1461
01:43:23,998 --> 01:43:26,137
My name is on the title, you say?

1462
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,908
Yeah, but you're gonna
have to let me drive it.

1463
01:43:30,805 --> 01:43:33,342
You work out something
with the prize people?

1464
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:36,081
Yeah.

1465
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:38,914
They were willing to go
as far as the truck.

1466
01:43:39,013 --> 01:43:40,390
Come on, get in.

1467
01:45:18,746 --> 01:45:21,158
Okay, Dad,
it's your turn to drive.

1468
01:45:24,118 --> 01:45:25,961
You said I couldn't.

1469
01:45:26,921 --> 01:45:28,457
Just drive it down Locust Street.

1470
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:31,025
It's only a few blocks.
There's no traffic.

1471
01:45:33,594 --> 01:45:34,937
Come on.

1472
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:37,500
It's your truck.

1473
01:47:08,689 --> 01:47:11,033
Hey, there!
Looking good, Woody!

1474
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,126
Get down.

1475
01:47:12,226 --> 01:47:14,263
- What?
- God damn it! Get down!

1476
01:47:16,297 --> 01:47:18,072
Looking good!

1477
01:48:41,949 --> 01:48:43,656
So long, Albert.

1478
01:48:44,618 --> 01:48:46,461
So long, Woody.
