00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,442
Ah!

5
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:16,576
I scared you!
No, you didn't.

6
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,378
Okay! Remember our field
trip rules, everyone.

7
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,449
Uh, no pushing, no biting,
and no fire breathing!

8
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,116
What did I just say?

9
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,818
Eighteen, nineteen...

10
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,539
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?

11
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,755
Oh. Mike Wazowski.

12
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,493
Thanks, Joe.

13
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:34,495
Good luck finishing
your crossword puzzle.

14
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:35,662
Sorry, Michael.
I didn't see you.

15
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,630
That's okay.

16
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,166
When I was on the bus,
I found a nickel!

17
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,135
I wish I had pockets.

18
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,404
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.

19
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:49,410
Jeremy! You and me?
Okay, no biggie.

20
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,611
Hailey? No?
Pairing up with Claire?

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,346
Great choice.
She's a good egg.

22
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,313
Russell.

23
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,715
Mike? Wazowski?

24
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,784
We car-pool?

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,222
- We're cousins.
- Hey!

26
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:04,858
Okay. Good catching up.

27
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,859
Well, Michael, it looks like
it's you and me again.

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,235
Come on, Karen.
We're falling behind.

29
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,716
Please don't call me Karen.

30
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,877
<i>Now, stay close together.</i>

31
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,746
We're entering
a very dangerous area.

32
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,549
Welcome to the Scare Floor.

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,883
Wow!

34
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:36,856
This is where we
collect the Scream Energy

35
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,225
to power our whole world.

36
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,195
And can anyone tell me whose job
it is to go get that scream?

37
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,263
Scarers!

38
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,731
That's right!

39
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,799
Now, which one of you can
give me the scariest roar?

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,801
Me, me, me!

41
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,670
Oh! Sir! Right here!
Little green guy,

42
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,172
two o'clock!

43
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,706
No, it's like this.

44
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,208
Hey, guys, watch this one.

45
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,290
Hey, I got a really good...

46
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,812
Wow!

47
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:13,959
Whoa.

48
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,698
Well, hey there, kids. Are you
on a tour with your school?

49
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,200
- Yeah!
- Yes.

50
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,202
We're here to learn
about Scream Energy

51
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,504
and what it takes
to be a Scarer.

52
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:28,341
Well, hey, you're in luck, because
I just happen to be a Scarer.

53
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,310
I learned everything
I know from my school,

54
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,678
Monsters University.

55
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,780
Whoa.

56
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:34,747
It's the best
Scaring School there is.

57
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,418
You wish!
Fear Tech's the best.

58
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,285
Okay. You guys
watch us and tell me

59
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,647
which school's the best.
All right?

60
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,254
MU is.

61
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,528
<i>West coast coming only.</i>

62
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,530
<i>Scarers coming only.</i>

63
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,898
Oops.
Stop right there.

64
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,766
Don't cross over
that safety line.

65
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,901
Human children
are extremely toxic.

66
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,372
Look at that!

67
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,741
Whoa! Hey, guys,
watch the eye! Ow!

68
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,909
Look at that!
It's amazing!

69
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,844
I know!

70
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,613
- Wow!
- Excuse me. Fellas.

71
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,448
How about we do tallest in the back?

72
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,718
Look, he's going to

73
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,552
do a real scare!

74
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,556
Cool. I want to
be a Scarer.

75
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,924
Yeah. Me, too.

76
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,460
Come on, guys.
I want to see.

77
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:21,527
Out of the way, Wazowski.

78
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,928
You don't belong
on a Scare Floor.

79
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,774
Brian! Do not step
over the line.

80
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,942
Mrs. Graves, Michael
went over the line.

81
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,413
Michael!

82
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,851
See?
I told you. He's fine.

83
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,493
Well,
I thought I heard something.

84
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:46,678
What?

85
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,553
Are you okay?

86
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,887
You could have gotten hurt!

87
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,267
That was real dangerous, kid. I
didn't even know you were in there.

88
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,035
Wow. I didn't even know
you were in there.

89
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,038
Not bad, kid.

90
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,676
Michael, what do you have
to say for yourself?

91
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,014
How do I become a Scarer?

92
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,168
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?

93
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,707
Well, everyone, I don't
mean to get emotional,

94
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,110
but everything in my life
has led to this moment.

95
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,078
Let it not be just the
beginning of my dream

96
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,747
but the beginning
of all of our dreams.

97
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,916
Gladys, promise me
you'll keep auditioning.

98
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,453
Marie, Mr. Right is
out there somewhere.

99
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:34,587
Phil, keep using the ointment
till that thing goes away.

100
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,055
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!

101
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,962
I'm welling up with tears.
Now, get off.

102
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,193
Hello. How are you doing?

103
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,603
Ah!

104
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,706
Whoo-hoo!

105
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,180
Stroke! Stroke!

106
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,502
Come on,
put all you have into it!

107
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,989
Okay! First thing on
my list, get registered.

108
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,558
Hey there, freshman.
I'm Jay the R.A.,

109
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,660
and I'm here to say that
registration is that away!

110
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,228
Okay, Jay.

111
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,230
Have a great first day.

112
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,666
Hey, I'm Kay! Here's
your orientation packet.

113
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,167
Thanks, Kay.

114
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,769
You can drop your bags off here

115
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,004
and get your
picture taken with Trey.

116
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,204
Say hooray!
Hooray!

117
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,074
I can't believe it.

118
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,844
I'm officially
a college student!

119
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,179
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay,

120
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,148
and I'll be giving you your
orientation tour on this perfect day!

121
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,023
Here are the labs
where students learn

122
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,944
to design and build the
doors to the human world.

123
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,866
Looks like the professor
is about to test a door!

124
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,081
The MU cafeteria serves a full
buffet, three meals a day.

125
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,649
I personally believe we have some
of the best chefs in the world.

126
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,954
Oh! Yeah!

127
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,889
Yeah!

128
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,825
The campus offers
a wide variety of majors,

129
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:57,128
but the crown jewel of MU
is the Scaring School.

130
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,646
Welcome to the debate team.
We're happy to have you.

131
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,982
I disagree for
the following reasons.

132
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,083
True happiness is a
theoretical construct...

133
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,885
Hey there! Keep
your eye on the sky

134
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,353
at the astronomy club!

135
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,894
Hey, hey, hey! Come
join the improve club.

136
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,730
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...

137
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,398
Ah, dang it!

138
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,636
MU's Greek Council. We sponsor
the annual Scare Games.

139
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,670
The Scare what now?

140
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,171
The Scare Games!

141
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,307
A super-intense
Scaring competition!

142
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,276
They're crazy dangerous,
so anything could happen.

143
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,146
A bunch of guys went
to the hospital last year!

144
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,314
You could totally die.

145
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,116
And it's worth it.

146
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,117
You get a chance to prove
that you are the best!

147
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,119
Cool.

148
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,442
Wazowski, Room 319.

149
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,271
You know, your roommate
is a Scaring major, too.

150
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,163
"Hello, I'm your roommate."
Oh, that's too bland.

151
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,365
Don't force it.
Just let it happen.

152
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,934
Your lifelong best friend
is right behind this door.

153
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,178
Hey there.
I'm your roomie.

154
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,347
Name's Randy Boggs.
Scaring major.

155
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,083
Oh! Mike
Wazowski, Scaring major.

156
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,818
I can tell we're going
to be best chums, Mike.

157
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,687
Take whichever bed you want.

158
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,721
I wanted you to
have first dibs.

159
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,189
Ahh!

160
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,124
You just disappeared.

161
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,261
Sorry. If I do that in Scaring
class, I'll be a joke.

162
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,064
No, it's totally great.
You got to use it.

163
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,298
Really?
Yeah, but lose the glasses.

164
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,699
They give it away.
Huh.

165
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,077
Okay!

166
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,346
Unpack. Check.
Hang posters. Check.

167
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,483
Now I just need to ace my
classes, graduate with honors,

168
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:58,452
and become
the greatest Scarer ever.

169
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:00,386
Boy, I wish I had
your confidence, Mike.

170
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,821
Aren't you even
a little nervous?

171
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,154
Actually, no.

172
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,459
I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

173
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,030
I just can't
wait to get started.

174
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,149
Oh, man! I can't be
late on the first day!

175
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,778
Wow.

176
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,296
You got to be kidding me.

177
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,800
I'm so nervous!

178
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,334
Relax. It will be fine.

179
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,256
Good morning, students.

180
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,236
Welcome to Scaring 101.

181
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,475
I am Professor Knight.

182
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:32,144
Now I'm sure all of you were the
scariest monster in your town.

183
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,181
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now,

184
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,915
and I do not scare easily.

185
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,430
Dean Hardscrabble.
This is a pleasant surprise.

186
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,469
She's a legend.

187
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,270
She broke
the all-time Scare Record

188
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,551
with the scream
in that very can!

189
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,975
I don't mean to interrupt.

190
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,977
I just thought I'd drop by

191
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:08,246
to see the terrifying faces
joining my program.

192
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,550
Well, I'm sure my students
would love to hear

193
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,117
a few words of inspiration.

194
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,855
Inspiration? Very well.

195
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,596
Scariness is the true
measure of a monster.

196
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:24,863
If you're not scary

197
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,132
what kind of a monster are you?

198
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,238
It's my job to make
great students greater,

199
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:40,079
not make mediocre students
less mediocre.

200
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,981
That is why at the end of the
semester there will be a final exam.

201
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:49,254
Fail that exam and you are
out of the Scaring program.

202
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,528
So, I should hope you're
all properly inspired.

203
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,406
All right. All right.

204
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,374
Who can tell me the properties
of an effective roar?

205
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,276
Yes?

206
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,513
There are actually five.

207
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,016
Those include
the roar's resonance,

208
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,050
the duration of the roar,
and the...

209
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,990
Whoops. Sorry.

210
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,660
I heard someone say "roar,"
so I just kind of went for it.

211
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:30,029
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

212
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,197
I didn't mean to scare you there.
Hey, how you doing?

213
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,033
Very impressive, Mister...

214
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,333
Sullivan.
Jimmy Sullivan.

215
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,336
Sullivan.

216
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,439
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?

217
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,540
Yeah. He's my dad.

218
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,243
He's a Sullivan!

219
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:47,313
I should have known.
I expect big things from you.

220
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:50,282
Well, you won't
be disappointed.

221
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,351
Uh... I'm sorry.
Should I keep going?

222
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,152
No, no.
Mr. Sullivan's covered it.

223
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,623
Huh.

224
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,658
Everyone take out
your Scaring textbooks

225
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,627
and open them to chapter one.

226
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,562
Hey, bub.
Can I borrow a pencil?

227
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,698
I forgot all my stuff.

228
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,199
Ah! All right. Yes. There we go.
That will get it.

229
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,170
Mmm... Yeah.

230
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,072
Come on, Mike.
It's a fraternity

231
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,442
and sorority party.
We have to go!

232
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:17,375
If we flunk that Scaring
final, we are done.

233
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,745
I'm not taking any chances.

234
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,347
You've got
the whole semester to study,

235
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,115
but this might
be our only chance

236
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,217
to get in good
with the cool kids.

237
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,119
That's why I made these cupcakes.
Oops.

238
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,655
That could
have been embarrassing.

239
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,590
When I'm a Scarer, life
will be a nonstop party.

240
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,492
Stay out of trouble, wild man.

241
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,293
Wild man.

242
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,406
What the...

243
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,609
Archie!

244
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,747
Boo!

245
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:55,948
Hey! What are you...

246
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,384
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...

247
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,422
- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.

248
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:03,423
That guy's in big trouble.

249
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:04,222
Yeah, he is.

250
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,225
Hey, guys!
Over here!

251
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,795
Fear Tech dummies.

252
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,630
Oh, oh!

253
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,731
Sorry about that, buddy.

254
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,099
Why are you in my room?

255
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,060
Your room? This is my...

256
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,037
This is not my room.

257
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,406
Archie! Come here, boy.

258
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:20,739
Archie?

259
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,142
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.

260
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,510
Why is it here?

261
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,378
I stole it. Going to
take it to the RORs.

262
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,113
The what?

263
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:31,484
Roar Omega Roar.
The top fraternity on campus.

264
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:33,585
They only accept
the highly elite.

265
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,255
Okay, I'll lift the bed,
you grab the pig.

266
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,756
Ready? One, two, three. What?
No, no... Oh! What...

267
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,258
That's it.
Don't let go.

268
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,224
Careful. He's a biter.

269
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,762
- Whoa! Whoa, hey...
- Whoa!

270
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,100
I got him!

271
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,401
Uh-oh! Whoa!

272
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,573
That was awesome!

273
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,376
What am I doing?
James P. Sullivan.

274
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,678
Mike Wazowski.

275
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,846
Listen, it was quite
delightful meeting you

276
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,581
and whatever that is,

277
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,217
but if you don't mind,
I have to study my Scaring.

278
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,151
You don't
need to study Scaring.

279
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,087
You just do it.

280
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,490
Really? I think there's a
little more to it than that.

281
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:11,824
But, hey, thanks
for stopping by.

282
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:12,757
Let go of that!

283
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,160
My hat!
My pig!

284
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,829
Ooh!

285
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,233
Hey! Come here!

286
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,500
Hey!

287
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:24,368
Catch it!

288
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,174
Ooh! Yeah!

289
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,508
Ride it to frat row!

290
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,681
<i>♪ Tentacles and serpent's
wings, they... ♪</i>

291
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,547
Hey!

292
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,418
Whoa... Ow!

293
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,224
Wow!

294
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,362
Whoa!

295
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,500
Go, go, go!

296
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,701
Hey...

297
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,669
Come on! Hey!
Ooh!

298
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,237
Cupcake?

299
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,241
Whoa...

300
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,285
Ooh!

301
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,827
Got it!

302
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,333
Fear Tech's mascot!
MU rules!

303
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,481
Did you see him catch that pig?

304
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:43,615
You are Jaws Theta Chi
material, freshman.

305
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,683
Oh, thanks.
I don't know...

306
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,785
No, no, no.
He's an Omega Howl guy.

307
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:47,819
Back off.
We saw him first.

308
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,655
No way. We did!

309
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,322
I'll take it
from here, gentlemen.

310
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,226
Johnny Worthington, president
of Roar Omega Roar.

311
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,529
What's your name, big blue?

312
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,731
Jimmy Sullivan.
Friends call me Sulley.

313
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,402
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?

314
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:03,802
I can't believe it! That is crazy!

315
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,804
Chet, calm down.
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,840
Sulley, any freshman with the guts
to pull off a stunt like that

317
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,510
has got "Future Scarer"
written all over him.

318
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,946
Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
That took guts.

319
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:17,349
Slow down, squirt. This party
is for Scare students only.

320
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,618
Oh, sorry, killer, but you
might want to hang out

321
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,220
with someone
a little more your speed.

322
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,722
Uh... They look fun!

323
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,624
Oh, hey there. Want
to join Oozma Kappa?

324
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,257
We have cake.

325
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,930
Go crazy.

326
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,233
Is that a joke?

327
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,868
Sulley, talk to your friend.

328
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,605
Oh, he's not really
my friend, but sure.

329
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,607
You heard him. This is a
party for Scare students.

330
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,409
I am a Scare student.

331
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,244
I mean for Scare
students who actually,

332
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,613
you know, have a chance.

333
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,681
Aw, snap!

334
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,452
My chances are
just as good as yours.

335
00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:54,133
You're not even in the
same league with me.

336
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,988
Just wait, hotshot.

337
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,523
I'm going to scare circles
around you this year.

338
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,204
Oh, okay.
I'd like to see that.

339
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,394
Oh, don't worry. You will.

340
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,836
Ready position.

341
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,738
Common crouch.

342
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,742
I want to see matted fur and yellow teeth.
Basic snarl.

343
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,677
Show me some slobber.

344
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,611
Drool is a tool,
kids. Use it.

345
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,516
Now here is a monster
who looks like a Scarer.

346
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,488
You want a hope of passing
this class, you better eat,

347
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:30,168
breathe, and sleep Scaring.

348
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,550
Yeah!

349
00:21:58,551 --> 00:21:59,851
Give me another one.

350
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,487
Fear of spiders.
Arachnophobia.

351
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,754
Fear of thunder.
Keraunophobia.

352
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,890
Fear of chopsticks!
Consecotaleophobia.

353
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,732
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.

354
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:10,342
Go Monsters University!
You know what to do!

355
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,873
The answer is C, fangs.

356
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,575
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.

357
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,644
A bowl of spiders!
Correct!

358
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,779
A clown running in the dark!
Right again.

359
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,648
Warts, boils, and moles,
in that order.

360
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:30,730
Outstanding!

361
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,762
Ah! Whoa!

362
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,698
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

363
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,791
Ah!

364
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,001
Ogre slump.

365
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,470
Zombie snarl.

366
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:25,592
Dominant silverback gorilla.

367
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,673
That is some remarkable
improvement, Michael.

368
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:34,545
One frightening face does not
a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.

369
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,962
A Tauntaun grimace
with extra slobber.

370
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,165
You got it!
That's what I'm saying.

371
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,801
I am going to wipe the floor
with that little know-it-all.

372
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,936
Yes, you are, big blue.

373
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,604
Hey, wait.
What are you guys...

374
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,173
It's just a precaution.

375
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:03,809
RORs are the best Scarers
on campus, Sullivan.

376
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,577
Can't have a member getting
shown up by a beach ball.

377
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,646
Whoo-hoo!
I am on a roll.

378
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,482
I'm going to destroy that guy.

379
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,550
Well, then you'll get
this back right away.

380
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,018
It's time to start delivering
on that Sullivan name.

381
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,461
Today's final will judge your
ability to assess a child's fear

382
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:25,095
and perform the appropriate
Scare in the Scare Simulator.

383
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,705
The Child Sensitivity
Level will be raised

384
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,641
from Bed-wetter
to Heavy Sleeper,

385
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,578
so give it
everything you've got.

386
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,013
Dean Hardscrabble is
with us this morning

387
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,014
to see who will be moving on
in the Scaring program

388
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,182
and who will not.

389
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,025
Let's get started.

390
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:57,027
I am a five-year-old girl afraid
of spiders and Santa Claus.

391
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,129
Which Scare do you use?

392
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,065
Uh...

393
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,158
That's a Seasonal
Creep and Crawl.

394
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,239
Demonstrate.

395
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:20,118
Results will be posted
outside my office. Next.

396
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,821
Focus.

397
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,189
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!

398
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,639
Hey. Do you mind?

399
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:43,327
Don't mind at all.

400
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,680
Come on, Mike.
Let's just move.

401
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,553
Stay out of my way.

402
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,054
Unlike you, I had to work hard
to get into the Scare program.

403
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,658
That's because
you don't belong here.

404
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:11,942
That's what I thought.

405
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,853
Whoa! Whoa...

406
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,334
I'm so sorry.

407
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,935
It was an accident.

408
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,072
What? This?

409
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:24,074
My one souvenir from
a lifetime of Scaring?

410
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,880
Accidents happen, don't they.

411
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,015
The important thing
is no one got hurt.

412
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,446
You're taking
this remarkably well.

413
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,256
Now, let's continue the exams.

414
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,925
Mr. Wazowski,
I'm a five-year-old girl

415
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,961
on a farm in Kansas
afraid of lightning.

416
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,028
Which Scare do you use?

417
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,365
Shouldn't I go up on the...

418
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,199
Which Scare do you use?

419
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,038
That is a Shadow Approach
with a Crackle Holler.

420
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,904
Demonstrate.

421
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,209
Stop. Thank you.
But I didn't get to...

422
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,343
I've seen enough.

423
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,447
I'm a seven-year-old boy...

424
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,152
I wasn't finished.

425
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,422
I don't need to know
any of that stuff to scare.

426
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:12,057
That "stuff"
would've informed you

427
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:15,694
that this particular child
is afraid of snakes.

428
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:18,196
So a roar wouldn't make him
scream, it would make him cry,

429
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,999
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,

430
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,834
destroying life as we know it,

431
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,836
and of course
we can't have that.

432
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,805
So I'm afraid I cannot
recommend that you continue

433
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:29,442
in the Scaring program.
Good day.

434
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:32,243
Wait, what?
But I'm a Sullivan.

435
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,179
Well then, I'm sure your family

436
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,879
will be very disappointed.

437
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,966
And, Mr. Wazowski,
what you lack is something

438
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,233
that cannot be taught.

439
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,236
You're not scary.

440
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,409
You will not be continuing
in the Scaring program.

441
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,818
Please. Let me try the simulator.
I'll surprise you.

442
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,916
Surprise me?
I doubt that very much.

443
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,165
<i>Welcome back.</i>

444
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,033
<i>I hope everyone had a pleasant break.</i>

445
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,508
Some say that a career as a
scream-can designer is boring,

446
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:40,478
unchallenging, a waste
of a monster's potential.

447
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:47,085
Open your textbooks
to chapter three.

448
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:50,021
We will now plunge
into the rich history

449
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,021
of scream-can design.

450
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,069
Out of my way!

451
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,572
Coming through!
Oh, sorry. Ha-ha!

452
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:47,545
<i>Welcome to this year's
Greek Scare Games kickoff.</i>

453
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,313
<i>The Scare Game! Yeah!</i>

454
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:57,088
<i>We have a special guest,
the founder of the games,</i>

455
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,289
<i>Dean Hardscrabble.</i>

456
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,092
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

457
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,130
<i>As a student, I created these gas</i>

458
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,397
<i>as a friendly competition,</i>

459
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,501
<i>but be prepared.</i>

460
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:12,438
<i>To take home the trophy,</i>

461
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:15,138
<i>you must be the most
fearsome monsters on campus.</i>

462
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:20,979
<i>So good luck, and may
the best monsters win.</i>

463
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,282
<i>We're closing down sign-up,
so we'll see you all...</i>

464
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,148
Wait!

465
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,352
I'm signing up!

466
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:31,655
What?

467
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,561
<i>Uh... You have to be in
a fraternity to compete.</i>

468
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,664
Behold the next winning
fraternity of the Scare Games,

469
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:43,967
the brothers, my brothers,
of Oozma Kappa!

470
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,271
Hi.

471
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,176
Mr. Wazowski,
what are you doing?

472
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,612
You just said the winners are the
most fearsome monsters on campus.

473
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,681
If I win, it means you
kicked out the best Scarer

474
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,417
in the whole school.

475
00:31:58,418 --> 00:31:59,249
That won't happen.

476
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,520
How about a little wager?

477
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,188
If I win, you let me back
in the Scaring program.

478
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,692
And what would that prove?

479
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,560
That you were wrong.

480
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,501
Very well.

481
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:19,604
If you win, I will
let your entire team

482
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,071
into the Scare program.

483
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,944
But if you lose,

484
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,577
you will leave
Monsters University.

485
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,584
Deal.

486
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:37,021
Now all you need to do is find
enough members to compete.

487
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,156
We need six guys, right?

488
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,024
<i>Sorry, chief.</i>

489
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,592
<i>We count bodies, not heads.
That dude counts as one.</i>

490
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:46,498
Anybody else want to join our team?
Anyone at all?

491
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,066
Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm late.

492
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,401
Can I squeeze by you?
Randy!

493
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,502
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.

494
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,671
Oh. Sorry.
I'm already on a team.

495
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,239
Boggs.

496
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,375
I'm finally in with
the cool kids, Mike.

497
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,508
Don't blow this for me.

498
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,246
Do the thing.

499
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,215
Oh! Where did he go?

500
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,484
Please, anybody.

501
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:08,086
I need one more monster.
Just one more!

502
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:10,021
<i>Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good.</i>

503
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,056
<i>We have to move on. Your
team doesn't qualify.</i>

504
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,123
Yes, it does!

505
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,595
The star player
has just arrived.

506
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,999
No way! Someone else!
Please! Anyone else.

507
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,441
<i>We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?
Is he on your team or not?</i>

508
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:26,964
Come on! Let's go!

509
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,408
Fine! Yes,
he's on my team.

510
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,576
Good luck.

511
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,547
All right, Wazowski,
what's the plan?

512
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,424
This is a fraternity house?

513
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:48,525
Hey there, teammates!
Come on aboard!

514
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,464
As the president
of Oozma Kappa,

515
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,364
it is my honor to welcome
you to your new home.

516
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,203
We call this room
"Party Central."

517
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,772
Technically, we haven't
actually had a party here yet.

518
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,706
But when we do, we'll be ready!

519
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,681
Whoo!

520
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:14,218
The hot cocoa train
is coming through! Whoa!

521
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,187
Next stop... You!

522
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,457
I would like to
start us off first by...

523
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,225
So, you guys
are Scaring majors?

524
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,362
We were! None
of us lasted very long.

525
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:27,433
I guess we just weren't what old
Hardscrabble was looking for.

526
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,066
Don Carlton, mature student.

527
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:32,770
Thirty years in
the textile industry

528
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,073
and then old dandy Don
got downsized.

529
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,108
Figured I could throw
myself a pity party,

530
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,210
or go back to school
and learn the computers.

531
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,212
Hello. I'm Terry
with a "Y"...

532
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:43,781
And I'm Terri with an "I"!
I'm a dance major!

533
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,349
And I'm not.

534
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,453
Five, six, seven, eight!

535
00:34:47,454 --> 00:34:49,554
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?

536
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:51,823
Because we never
agreed to do this!

537
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,191
You said this was
going to be cool!

538
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:54,525
No one said
this was gonna be cool.

539
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,626
Now I'm embarrassed.
Now you're embarrassed?

540
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,528
Yes, because
it's in front of people!

541
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,396
You should wake up embarrassed.

542
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,298
Hey, hey, hey!

543
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:03,334
I'm Art!
New Age philosophy major.

544
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,055
Excited to live with you
and laugh with you,

545
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,304
and cry with you.

546
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,515
Thought you might like
to keep a dream journal.

547
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,113
Guess that leaves me.
Ah!

548
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,547
My name's Scott Squibbles.

549
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,282
My friends call me Squishy.

550
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,585
I'm undeclared, unattached,

551
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:25,256
and unwelcome pretty much
everywhere but here.

552
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,258
Now that we've all been introduced,
as captain of our team...

553
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:30,161
So, basically, you guys have
no Scaring experience?

554
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:33,397
Not a lot!
But now we've got you!

555
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,500
You're about the scariest
fella I've ever seen.

556
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:36,701
Even with them pink polka dots.

557
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:38,836
Aw, thanks.

558
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,571
Actually, I think I bring
the whole package.

559
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,340
Your hands are
as big as my face!

560
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,908
He's like a mountain with fur!

561
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,445
Oh, come on.
I don't even work out.

562
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:50,715
Yeah, me neither. I don't
want to get too big.

563
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:53,618
We thought our dreams were
over, but Mike said if we win,

564
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,186
they're letting us in
the Scaring program.

565
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,321
We're going to be real Scarers!

566
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,190
The best!
You betcha!

567
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,257
Yeah!
Right.

568
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,696
And here's what you've been
waiting for, fellas.

569
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,297
Your very own
Oozma Kappa bedroom.

570
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,936
Oh... Great!
We're sharing this room?

571
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:14,172
We'll let you guys get settled.

572
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,507
Anything you need, you just
give a big holler-oonie!

573
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,577
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?

574
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,745
Look, they don't
need to be good.

575
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,481
I'm going to
carry the whole team.

576
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,782
Really? And who's
going to carry you?

577
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,217
Hey, if you want to
go back to can design,

578
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,299
you know where the door is.

579
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,188
Great.

580
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,458
Guys?

581
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,726
Anybody home?

582
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,436
Um...

583
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:45,502
Hello?

584
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,370
Fellas?

585
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,781
Do you pledge your souls

586
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:58,749
to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?

587
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,784
Ow!
Do you swear to

588
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,252
keep secret...

589
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,386
...all that
you learn here?

590
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,688
No matter how horrifying?

591
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,291
Hey!

592
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,826
Will you take the sacred
oath of the...

593
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,995
For crying out loud.
Sweetie!

594
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,897
Turn the lights on
while you're down here!

595
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,799
You're going to ruin your eyes!

596
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,702
Mom!
We're doing an initiation!

597
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:20,538
Oh, scary.
Well, carry on.

598
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,540
Just pretend I'm not here.

599
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:23,463
This is my mom's house.

600
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,517
Do you promise to look out
for your brothers...

601
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,915
...no matter what the peril?

602
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,789
Will you defend Oozma Kappa
no matter how dangerous?

603
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,859
No matter how insurmountable
the odds may be?

604
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,795
From evils both
great and small?

605
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,464
In the face of
unending pain and...

606
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,701
Oh, forget it!
You're in.

607
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,503
Look, we know
we're no one's first choice

608
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,005
for a fraternity,

609
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:56,408
so it means a lot
to have you here with us.

610
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:59,643
Can't wait to start Scaring
with you, brothers.

611
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,456
Time for a celebration!
Yeah!

612
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,990
Grab the couch cushions,
gentlemen,

613
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,324
because we're building a fort!

614
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,840
Mom, can we
stay up late tonight?

615
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,980
Mmm, I know you're a princess
and I'm just a stable boy.

616
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:39,516
Yuck!

617
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,086
Mom! What are you doing?

618
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,988
Your grubby paw was in my bed!

619
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,389
Were you kissing my hand?

620
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,359
No. And what about you
with all your shedding?

621
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,326
I don't shed.
Really.

622
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,862
Uh...

623
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,030
Excuse me.
I just want to get my stuff.

624
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,865
Would you just...
Oh, hey. Come on!

625
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:55,966
...let me get my stuff!

626
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,334
My butt!

627
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:00,871
First morning in the house.

628
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,740
That's going in the album!

629
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:03,941
Guys!
We got a letter!

630
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,676
A letter?

631
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,345
We never get mail.

632
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:08,546
Oh! Sorry.
It's stuck.

633
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:09,847
Would you...
Give me that!

634
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,383
Tentacles.
They're sticky.

635
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,351
It's the first event
of the Scare Games.

636
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,055
"A child's room
is where you scare,

637
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,991
but avoid
the toxicity lurking there."

638
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,752
Wait a minute. Where do
they want us to meet?

639
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:30,634
Of all the sewers on campus, this
one has always been my favorite.

640
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,103
Art, you've been here before?

641
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:34,104
I have a life outside
of the house, you know.

642
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:39,677
Welcome to your
worst nightmare,

643
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:40,910
the Scare Games!

644
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,128
Scare Games! Scare Games!

645
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,124
Yes!
Yes, I love it!

646
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,458
I love this energy!

647
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,828
Okay. Okay, everybody.

648
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,499
Let's hear it
for the frats and sororities

649
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,401
competing in
this year's games...

650
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,767
Jaws Theta Chi!

651
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,738
Python Nu Kappa!

652
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,905
Slugma Slugma Kappa!

653
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,175
Roar Omega Roar!

654
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:14,944
Eta Hiss Hiss!

655
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,115
And finally, Oozma Kappa.

656
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,587
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

657
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,091
Hi, Mom!

658
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,426
Smile!

659
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,497
Let's begin
the first competition,

660
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:33,863
the Toxicity Challenge!

661
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,969
Human children are toxic!

662
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,673
And anything
they touch is toxic.

663
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,742
We don't have any human toys,

664
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:47,111
but thanks to MU's
biology department,

665
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,645
we found a close second,

666
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:51,714
the stinging glow urchin!

667
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,053
Trust me when I say,

668
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,922
you are not gonna want
to touch this bad boy!

669
00:40:57,923 --> 00:40:59,857
I want to touch it.

670
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,099
And you certainly don't want
to touch any of its friends.

671
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,466
Yeah, I want to touch them.

672
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,633
This is the starting line.

673
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,970
The light at the end of the
tunnel is the finish line.

674
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,738
And whoever comes in last is
eliminated from the games.

675
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,478
Mike...
What is it?

676
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:20,644
Does that mean if
we lose, we're out?

677
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,146
Don't worry, Smoothie.
Squishy!

678
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,881
Squishy.
We're not going to lose,

679
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26,883
because we have everything
we need to win right here.

680
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,520
Heart.

681
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:30,988
No! Me. I'm going to
win the race for us.

682
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,757
All right, all right.
That's very cute,

683
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:37,828
It's an obstacle course. What are
you going to do? Roar at it?

684
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,630
I can get through faster
than you, little guy.

685
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,567
Take your place at
the starting line!

686
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:44,901
This is all about teamwork.

687
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,537
Everybody, stick together.

688
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,075
I'm going to beat you
over that finish line.

689
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,776
Get ready to eat my dust.

690
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:55,145
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?

691
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:58,048
Attention, teams.
One last thing.

692
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,649
Scarers work in the dark.

693
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,584
I want to go home!
On your marks...

694
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,694
Hey, uh, good luck, ladies.

695
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,863
Thanks! We're going to
rip you to pieces!

696
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,664
What?

697
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:17,761
...get set...

698
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,171
Go!

699
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,132
I'm going to touch them!

700
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,753
Ow!

701
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:36,686
Come on!

702
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,904
Uh, guys! We're falling
behind a little! Fellas!

703
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,696
Cheese and crackers!

704
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,298
Son of a moustache!

705
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,600
Salisbury steak, that hurts!

706
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:50,901
Is that as fast as you can go?

707
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,182
Just getting started!
What the...

708
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,773
Whoa! Ah!

709
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,641
Oh... Ah!

710
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:00,843
That's got to hurt!

711
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,284
Ow, ow, ow...

712
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:08,986
Ooh!
Terry!

713
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:10,587
Don't worry, we'll be fi...

714
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,602
Ha-ha!

715
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,672
Oh...

716
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:30,174
Uh-oh. Yikes!

717
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,941
Ow! Ow, ow, ow...

718
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,528
Roar Omega Roar wins!

719
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,331
Take that, Wazowski!

720
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:56,200
Are you delirious?
I beat you!

721
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:57,200
Get your eye checked!

722
00:43:58,268 --> 00:43:59,970
Oh, way to blow it, Oozmas!

723
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,739
Hey! Second place
ain't bad.

724
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,906
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!

725
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:04,975
What?

726
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,177
Your whole team has to
cross the finish line.

727
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:08,212
Third place, EEKs!

728
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:09,780
- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.

729
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:10,914
Fifth place, HSS!

730
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,316
No, no, no!

731
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,678
And in last place,

732
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,818
Oozma Kappa.

733
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,355
I can't feel my anything.

734
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,893
Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa
has been eliminated!

735
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,129
No.

736
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:33,170
Don't look so surprised,
Mr. Wazowski.

737
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,407
It would have taken
a miracle for you to...

738
00:44:35,408 --> 00:44:38,443
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.

739
00:44:38,444 --> 00:44:40,943
Jaws Theta Chi has
been disqualified.

740
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:46,884
The use of illegal protective
gel is cause for elimination.

741
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:47,950
What!

742
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,023
Which means Oozma Kappa
is back in the games!

743
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,992
It's a miracle!

744
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,263
Your luck will
run out, eventually.

745
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,105
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

746
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,879
Okay!
Listen up, Oozmas.

747
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,347
Now, we're going to have to start
winning these things together,

748
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,249
so that means I'm going to need

749
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,784
each of you guys
to pull your own weight.

750
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,420
Mike?
What is it?

751
00:45:22,421 --> 00:45:24,955
We've made a list of our
strengths and weaknesses.

752
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:27,791
In high school, I was the
master of the silent scare.

753
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:29,793
I could sneak up
on a field mouse

754
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:30,893
in a pillow factory.

755
00:45:32,465 --> 00:45:34,097
Sorry! They get stickier
when I'm sweaty.

756
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,868
Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.

757
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:40,136
We're experts in the ancient
craft of close-up magic.

758
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,041
It's all about misdirection.

759
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,413
Uh...

760
00:45:48,414 --> 00:45:49,813
I have an extra toe.

761
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:52,182
Not with me, of course.

762
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,251
Guys, one slip-up on the next
event, and we're goners.

763
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,153
So for this to work,

764
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,255
I'm gonna need you to take
every instinct you have

765
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,377
and bury it deep, deep down.

766
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,225
Done.

767
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:02,059
From now on,
we are of one mind.

768
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,193
My mind.

769
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:05,195
Oh, please.

770
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,297
I will tell you exactly what
to do, and how to do it.

771
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,133
Uh... Okay, Mike.
Seems about right.

772
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:10,934
All right.
Give me scary steps.

773
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,936
Fifty up and down,
right now. Let's go!

774
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,440
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.

775
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:18,342
We can't just "get a new team"!

776
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:20,811
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.

777
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,246
What if we disguised a new team
to look like the old team?

778
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,148
Oh, no, no.
We are not cheating.

779
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:26,250
It's not cheating.
I'm just, you know,

780
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:27,332
leveling the playing field.

781
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,256
Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
but what do you want me to do?

782
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:34,425
They're not exactly the
scariest group in the world.

783
00:46:34,426 --> 00:46:36,926
Oh, a ladybug! Make a wish!
Make a wish!

784
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,900
This is not going to work.

785
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,201
Where are you going?
We're training.

786
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:46,003
I'm a Sullivan.

787
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:47,838
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.

788
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:48,939
You're charging
ahead when you...

789
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,240
Bup, bup, bup!

790
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,242
You tell them what
to do but not me.

791
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:53,576
So long, Coach.

792
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,048
Okay, Oozmas...

793
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,885
Boy, we need to get you a bell.

794
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:05,389
Listen up."If a kid hears you
coming, they'll call Mom or Dad",

795
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,889
"then you'd better run fast
or things will get bad."

796
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,159
Huh?

797
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,495
In the next event, if even
one of us gets caught,

798
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:12,463
we're all out.

799
00:47:12,464 --> 00:47:14,498
So remember,
do exactly what I do.

800
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,511
We are at the
halfway point of the second event,

801
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,378
and things are
getting interesting.

802
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,317
Got it.

803
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,573
Only two teams left.

804
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,457
Who will make it
out with their flag,

805
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,459
and who will be eliminated?

806
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,529
You do not want to get
caught by a kid's parent.

807
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,265
And in this event, you do
not want to get caught by

808
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,265
the librarian.

809
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,170
Quiet.

810
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,361
What's so scary about
a little old librarian?

811
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,286
I said, "Quiet."

812
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:37,247
Faster.
Slow and steady.

813
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,916
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.

814
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,183
Slow and steady.

815
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:41,317
Slow and steady.

816
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:02,440
Sullivan!
Sullivan!

817
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,339
Sullivan!
Sullivan!

818
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,515
Hmm.

819
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,424
Whew!

820
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,066
Ooh!

821
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,245
No!

822
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,391
Five, six, seven, eight!

823
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:56,225
Look over here!

824
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,568
Is that legal? You better
believe it, mop top!

825
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:07,003
The only rule is
don't get caught.

826
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,773
Who!

827
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,381
- Ooh!
- Hey! Over here!

828
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,054
Come and get me! Come and get me!
Whoo-hoo!

829
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:25,322
Guys, what are you doing?

830
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:26,323
They said don't
let her catch you.

831
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,392
But they didn't say how!

832
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:29,754
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Come on!

833
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:34,663
Whoa!

834
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:37,667
Whew!

835
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,404
We did it!

836
00:50:39,405 --> 00:50:41,738
No, we didn't.
We forgot the flag!

837
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:42,705
Mike?

838
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,243
Way to go, Squishy!
Way to go, Squishy!

839
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,512
How?

840
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:50,312
Misdirection.

841
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:59,322
The EEKs have been eliminated

842
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:03,428
and Oozma Kappa live
to scare another day!

843
00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:05,728
We're OK!
We're OK! We're OK!

844
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,437
I've never felt so alive!

845
00:51:12,438 --> 00:51:13,770
We were awesome!

846
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:16,606
Okay, look.
That wasn't real Scaring.

847
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,774
It was better
than what you did.

848
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,208
You should've
stuck to my strategy.

849
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,644
Whatever.

850
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:22,285
Talk to me when we start
the real Scaring.

851
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,616
Hey! You guys
going to the party?

852
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,486
Oh, I think you've
got the wrong guys.

853
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,488
- We don't get invited to...
- Party?

854
00:51:30,489 --> 00:51:32,722
The mid-games mixer
at the RORs'.

855
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:35,004
It's for the top Scare Teams.

856
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:37,793
See you there!

857
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:41,466
Did you hear that?
I can't believe it!

858
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,767
Uh-uh. Bad idea.
This is great.

859
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:46,470
They're finally seeing us as real Scarers.
We're going!

860
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,542
Do young people still dance?

861
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,211
Because my moves
are a little rusty.

862
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:56,379
Oh, we forgot to
bring a hostess gift.

863
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,881
We can't go in there without
some scented candles.

864
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:01,384
Calm down.
We earned this.

865
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:02,786
What if there's a
lull in the conversation?

866
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,554
I never know what
to... You know...

867
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:05,889
Say?

868
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,891
How are you so good at this?

869
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,693
You just took on
an angry 50-foot librarian,

870
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:11,595
and you're afraid
of a little party?

871
00:52:11,596 --> 00:52:13,162
Take a deep breath...

872
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:14,879
...and in you go!

873
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,640
Hello.

874
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:26,776
It's Oozma Kappa!

875
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,178
These guys are crazy!

876
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:30,280
What you did today was insane!

877
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:31,814
That was awesome!

878
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,421
Oozma Kappa, tonight
we party like Scarers!

879
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:03,746
I've never stayed up
this late in my life!

880
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,987
Hey, quiet! Quiet!

881
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,459
Quiet down,
you can-wranglers.

882
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,893
All right.
On behalf of the RORs,

883
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,829
we'd like to congratulate all the
teams that have made it this far.

884
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,553
All, right, let's
hear it for the PNKs!

885
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,569
I love that trick!
Never gets old. HSS!

886
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:36,740
Very creepy.

887
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:40,042
And finally, the surprise
team of the Scare Games,

888
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,419
Oozma Kappa!

889
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,917
Now, I got to admit, fellas,

890
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:49,551
I thought you were
a bunch of nobodies.

891
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,656
But, boy, was I wrong.

892
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,691
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!

893
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:56,559
Oozma Kappa!

894
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,593
Oh!

895
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,864
What?

896
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:03,500
The most adorable
monsters on campus.

897
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,337
Ooh! Oh!

898
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,343
Release the stuffed animals.

899
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:19,848
Faced!

900
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:28,558
Don't worry. Nobody
reads the school paper.

901
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,319
Yeah, but I'm pretty
sure they read the quad.

902
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,005
Whoo-hoo!

903
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,013
Thank you very much.

904
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,081
Okay. Would you like that
with two sleeves or four?

905
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:52,082
Thanks.
Tell your friends.

906
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,486
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

907
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:56,653
Raising a little
money for charity.

908
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:58,688
Yeah? Well, stop it.

909
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,557
You want us to stop raising money for charity?
That's not cool.

910
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,859
This guy hates charity!

911
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,628
I want you to stop
making us look like fools.

912
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:08,365
Hey, you're making yourselves
look like fools.

913
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:09,999
Let's be honest, boys.

914
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,001
You're never going
to be real Scarers,

915
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:14,703
because real Scarers
look like us.

916
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:20,710
But, hey, if you really want
to work for a Scare company

917
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,911
they're always
hiring in the mailroom.

918
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:29,685
Guys, hold on!

919
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:34,057
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
Don't listen to him.

920
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,692
We just need to keep trying.

921
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:37,994
No, you need to stop trying!

922
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:40,530
You can train monsters
like this all you want,

923
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:41,852
but you can't
change who they are.

924
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,672
Mike...

925
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:52,541
We appreciate everything
you've done, but he's right.

926
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:58,080
No matter how much we train,
we'll never look like them.

927
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,683
We're built

928
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,201
for other things.

929
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:18,469
Sorry, squirt!

930
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,590
Some monsters just aren't
cut out for the big leagues.

931
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,107
The big leagues.

932
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:26,909
Guys.

933
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,474
We're going on
a little field trip.

934
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:42,559
My tentacle fell asleep.

935
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,160
Thanks, Mom.
Have fun, kids!

936
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,463
I'll just be here
listening to my tunes.

937
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,937
Hey, uh, where are we?

938
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:55,070
The big leagues.

939
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,181
Holy roly-poly.

940
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:06,484
Wow.

941
00:58:06,485 --> 00:58:08,084
Nice fence.

942
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,251
This is amazing, Mike.

943
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:11,620
We're not stopping here.

944
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,215
This is crazy.
We're going to get arrested!

945
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,277
Oh, wow.

946
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:35,545
Whoa...

947
00:58:35,546 --> 00:58:37,080
Oh!

948
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,249
<i>All Scare Floors now active.</i>

949
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,217
<i>West coast coming online.
Scarers coming out.</i>

950
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,055
Look at them.

951
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,657
They're going
into the human world,

952
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:49,124
and they don't
even look scared!

953
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,197
Wow.

954
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,833
Take a good look, fellas.

955
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,114
See what they
all have in common?

956
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,072
Uh... No, not really.

957
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:07,010
Exactly. There's no
one type of Scarer.

958
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:09,292
The best Scarers use their
differences to their advantage.

959
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,582
Wow.

960
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,016
Terri? Look.

961
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:20,857
Hey!

962
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:23,560
Look at that old feller
racking up the big numbers!

963
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:26,663
Don, that old fella is
Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

964
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:29,299
What? Where?
That's really him?

965
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,634
He held the Scare
Record for three years!

966
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:33,770
Oh! Third door from the end!

967
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:36,139
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!

968
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,641
Look! It's
"Screaming" Bob Gunderson!

969
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:40,310
I still have his rookie card.
Me, too!

970
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:41,811
Doesn't have the speed
anymore, but his

971
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:43,645
technique is flawless.
Technique is flawless.

972
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,883
You collected Scare Cards, huh?

973
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:49,152
Yep. 450 of them.

974
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:52,021
Impressive. I have 6,000
still in mint condition,

975
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:53,823
but, you know,
450 is pretty good, too.

976
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,892
Hey, look at me! I'm Earl
"The Terror" Thompson!

977
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:57,026
Whoa!

978
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:59,162
Oh, that's great!

979
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:00,696
That's
a pretty good one, Squish.

980
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:05,901
I've been a real jerk.

981
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:08,704
So have I.

982
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:11,987
But it's not too late.

983
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,845
We could be a great team.

984
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:17,366
We just need to
start working together.

985
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,197
Hey!

986
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,372
What are you doing up there?

987
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,153
I can't go back to jail!

988
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,727
Come on!

989
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:31,927
They're right behind us!

990
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:36,832
Get back here!

991
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:45,375
Up there! Get them!

992
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:47,242
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

993
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,468
Thanks, brother!
Don't mention it.

994
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:57,220
I'm fine, really! It's just
a little heart attack.

995
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:59,087
Aw... I want
a piece of that action!

996
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:12,367
Mom! Start the car!

997
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,905
What?
Start the car!

998
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:17,441
Stop the bar?

999
01:01:17,442 --> 01:01:19,443
The car! Start the car!

1000
01:01:19,444 --> 01:01:21,076
Oh! Okay.

1001
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,313
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1002
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:25,948
Get in! Get in!

1003
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:27,349
Mom, go!
Seatbelts.

1004
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,952
Okay, go!

1005
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:30,953
Does anyone want gum?

1006
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:31,820
Just drive!

1007
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:33,789
Okay. Here we go!

1008
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,730
Oh, yeah!
Let's break in somewhere else!

1009
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,990
Rise and shine!

1010
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:10,727
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!

1011
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:12,360
Scary feet, scary feet...
Oh, he's back!

1012
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:15,798
Wake up!

1013
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:17,500
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!

1014
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:19,068
Do I hear thirty-nine?

1015
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,770
Come on!

1016
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:22,731
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa,
you're looking good.

1017
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,008
"To frighten a child
is the point of a Scare."

1018
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:29,011
"If you frighten a teen,
then Scarer beware."

1019
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,093
Okay, scare the little kid.

1020
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:32,522
Avoid the teenager!

1021
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:40,155
I'm on the phone!

1022
01:02:41,459 --> 01:02:42,425
No one understands me!

1023
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:44,960
Whatever.

1024
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,100
But, Daddy, I love him!

1025
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,810
<i>First place, Roar Omega Roar!</i>

1026
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:02,545
<i>Second place, Oozma Kappa!</i>

1027
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:04,481
Whoo!

1028
01:03:04,482 --> 01:03:05,814
<i>Third place, HSS.</i>

1029
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:11,046
You're lame.

1030
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,124
"Someone is coming, this
could ruin your night."

1031
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,193
"Stay hidden, take cover,
and stay out of sight!"

1032
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:18,260
You got 10 seconds.
Go!

1033
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:25,067
Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.

1034
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:26,269
And there should be one more.

1035
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:28,838
How did I do?

1036
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:30,206
Oh! Not too
shabby, Don!

1037
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:33,042
Thanks!
I cannot get down.

1038
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:34,243
Zombie snarl!

1039
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:36,379
Angry poodle.
Jazz clown.

1040
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,246
My Aunt Phyllis.

1041
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:38,548
In the morning.

1042
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:39,749
That's what I'm talking about!

1043
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,960
Time to go to work.

1044
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,249
You're out!

1045
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,185
You're out.

1046
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,190
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.

1047
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,202
Thank you.

1048
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,107
Yeah!

1049
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,244
Yeah!

1050
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:43,646
<i>We're down to two remaining team,</i>

1051
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:46,181
<i>Roar Omega Roar and Oozma Ka!</i>

1052
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:51,153
Which leads us to
the final event!

1053
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:54,056
"Every one of your skills
will be put to the test."

1054
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,461
"The Scare Simulator will
prove who's the best!"

1055
01:04:57,462 --> 01:05:00,062
Tomorrow night
you finally get to Scare

1056
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,898
in front of the whole school!

1057
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:05,134
Enjoy the attention
while it lasts, boys.

1058
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:08,638
After you lose,
no one will remember you.

1059
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:11,940
Maybe. But when you lose, no
one will let you forget it.

1060
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:16,244
Oh, boy. That is
a good point.

1061
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,548
Hey, Oozmas,
you guys are awesome!

1062
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:21,651
You've got to
teach us your moves.

1063
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:24,553
Well, then you're gonna
want to talk to this guy.

1064
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:26,522
Oh...
Sure, I can teach you.

1065
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:28,291
All right. You want to
hide behind the chair?

1066
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:29,453
You have to become the chair.

1067
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:31,960
Thanks for coming, Dean.

1068
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:35,164
Dean Hardscrabble!

1069
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:37,633
If we get back into
the Scaring program,

1070
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:38,874
I hope there's
no hard feelings.

1071
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,140
Tomorrow,
each of you must prove

1072
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,207
that you are undeniably scary.

1073
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,979
And I know for a fact
that one of you is not.

1074
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:58,955
No. He works
harder than anyone.

1075
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:00,490
Do you think he's scary?

1076
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:02,058
He's the heart and
soul of the team!

1077
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,492
Do you think he's scary?

1078
01:06:16,407 --> 01:06:19,443
We're going to win this thing
tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it!

1079
01:06:19,444 --> 01:06:21,124
We'll finally have
our lives back on track.

1080
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:24,613
Hey, Mike?

1081
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:27,683
You know, you've given me
a lot of really great tips.

1082
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:30,086
I'd love to return
the favor sometime.

1083
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:31,720
Oh. Yeah, sure.
Anytime.

1084
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,158
We're doing this now?
Okay.

1085
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,360
You've memorized
every textbook,

1086
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,261
every Scare Theory,
and that is great.

1087
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:40,730
Hey!

1088
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:42,665
But now it's time
to forget all that.

1089
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,735
Just reach deep down
and let the scary out!

1090
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:47,636
Huh. Just feel it.

1091
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:49,538
Exactly. Go wild.

1092
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:51,420
I don't know. I've kind of
got my own technique.

1093
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,475
Give it a try.

1094
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,177
Good, but bigger!

1095
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:58,714
Nope. You're thinking again.

1096
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,484
From the gut!

1097
01:07:00,485 --> 01:07:01,450
Let the animal out!

1098
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,686
Come on! Dig deep!

1099
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:09,024
Boys!
It's a school night!

1100
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:13,028
So, how was that?

1101
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:15,498
Up top.
Ha-ha!

1102
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,135
You know,
it did feel different!

1103
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:20,803
I feel like it's
all coming together.

1104
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:23,440
Yup, this time tomorrow the whole
school is finally going to see

1105
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:25,374
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1106
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,541

<i>First
Scarers to the starting line.</i>

1123
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:25,469
Okay, just like we planned. I'll go first.
Then, Don...

1124
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:28,104
Hold on. Mike's the one
who started all this

1125
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:30,466
and I think it's only right if
he's the one who finishes it.

1126
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:31,787
I think you should go last.

1127
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,509
Yes!

1128
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,550
Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!

1129
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,581
All right. Don,
you okay going first?

1130
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:40,348
I guess I'm as ready
as I'll ever be.

1131
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,619
Oozma Kappa!

1132
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,387
Go Oozmas!

1133
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:47,223
I'm gonna do it. I'm
going to beat this guy.

1134
01:08:47,224 --> 01:08:49,858
Hey, Bruiser! You take
it easy on grandpa.

1135
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:53,128
Unleash the beast, Don!

1136
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,163
Okay, then.

1137
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:43,811
Huh? Huh?

1138
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,649
Thanks for taking
it easy on grandpa.

1139
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,250
<i>Next group
to the starting line.</i>

1140
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:57,825
Let's do this.

1141
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:07,535
Yes! Yeah!

1142
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,294
Come on, Art.
Come on, buddy.

1143
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:33,535
You can do it.

1144
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,640
Yes!

1145
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,910
Aw!

1146
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,950
<i>Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!</i>

1147
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:07,362
You got this, Sull.

1148
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:34,589
<i>And it's all tied up!</i>

1149
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,993
<i>Ah!
Tough break for the RORs.</i>

1150
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:38,826
Huh?
Hearts?

1151
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,330
Huh?

1152
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:42,012
Way to go, Boggs!

1153
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:45,833
Yay!

1154
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,906
That's the last time
I lose to you, Sullivan.

1155
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:53,442
<i>Worthington and Wazowski,
to the starting line.</i>

1156
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:01,050
Hey.

1157
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:02,291
Don't worry about Hardscrabble.

1158
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:06,055
Don't worry about anyone else.

1159
01:12:06,056 --> 01:12:08,589
Just go out there and show them
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1160
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:12,060
Thanks.

1161
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,707
Don't take the loss too hard.

1162
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:25,948
You never belonged here anyway.

1163
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:59,041
<i>Amazing
performance by Worthington!</i>

1164
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,042
- Johnny, you're my hero!

1165
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:04,613
<i>The Oozmas
will need a record-breaking</i>

1166
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:06,080
<i>Scare to win this.</i>

1167
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,586
<i>You don't
belong on a Scare Floor.</i>

1168
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:13,088
<i>You're not scary.</i>

1169
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:15,390
<i>Come on! Dig deep!</i>

1170
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,432
Yeah!

1171
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,503
<i>They did it!</i>

1172
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,623
Yeah! Hey!

1173
01:13:50,494 --> 01:13:52,827
We're in the Scare
program! Yeah!

1174
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:59,067
Come here, you son of a gun!

1175
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:00,470
Way to go!

1176
01:14:00,471 --> 01:14:01,804
Yeah!

1177
01:14:01,805 --> 01:14:03,672
Oh! A little stuck.

1178
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,107
Pardon me there,
Ms. Squibbles.

1179
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:07,108
It's Sherrie.

1180
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:10,945
We did it!

1181
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,019
Way to go, Oozma Kappa!

1182
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:17,953
Thank you!
Thanks a lot.

1183
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,721
You rule!

1184
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:21,223
I have never ruled before.

1185
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:22,891
You guys killed it out there!

1186
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:24,026
Awesome!

1187
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:25,626
Hey, Wazowski!

1188
01:14:27,464 --> 01:14:29,384
Come on, let's go, you maniac!
We're celebrating.

1189
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:31,532
Mike?

1190
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,134
I did it.

1191
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:35,937
I can't believe it.

1192
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,108
I'm going to be a Scarer!

1193
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:41,844
Yeah, yes, you are.

1194
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:43,946
You hear that? Get
plenty of rest, kiddo.

1195
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:46,814
You haven't seen the last
of Mike Wazowski. Boo!

1196
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,793
I knew I was scary. I didn't
know I was that scary.

1197
01:14:57,794 --> 01:14:59,895
Yeah, we're so
scary I guess we broke it.

1198
01:14:59,896 --> 01:15:00,995
Come on.

1199
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,177
It's been tampered with.

1200
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,138
Uh, I don't think you should
be messing with that.

1201
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:19,580
Why are my settings different?

1202
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:21,516
Mike, we should leave.

1203
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,987
Did you do this?
Mike.

1204
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,722
Did you do this?

1205
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:27,788
I...

1206
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,661
Yes, I did.
But you don't understand.

1207
01:15:32,662 --> 01:15:35,163
Why? Why did you do this?

1208
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:37,165
You know, just in case.

1209
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:38,032
In case of what?

1210
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,176
You don't think I'm scary.

1211
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,206
Mike...

1212
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,328
You said you believed in me.

1213
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:47,743
But you're just
like Hardscrabble.

1214
01:15:47,744 --> 01:15:49,244
You're just like everyone else!

1215
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:50,679
Look, you'll get
better and better...

1216
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,081
I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!

1217
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:54,983
I just wanted to help.
No.

1218
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:56,685
You just wanted
to help yourself.

1219
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:59,654
Let the whole team fail
because you don't have it?

1220
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,023
So your
calculations were a little off.

1221
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:37,225
That door took me all semester.

1222
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:39,546
It's too dangerous. The professor's
just going to shred it.

1223
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:49,871
There he is, the big guy.

1224
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:51,606
The first of many
trophies, I am sure.

1225
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,290
Sullivan.

1226
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,079
Nice work out there.

1227
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,760
I look forward to
having you back in class.

1228
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,282
Hey, there he is!

1229
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,220
Looks like I was
wrong about you.

1230
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:07,122
You're one of us after all.

1231
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,290
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, broham!

1232
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:13,161
You are one of us now, okay?

1233
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:14,896
Anytime you want
to come hang out

1234
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:16,137
and do whatever,
you got a crew.

1235
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,167
You're a ROR, buddy!

1236
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:20,067
Hey!

1237
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:21,969
Where are you going?

1238
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,220
You did what?

1239
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:39,821
My team had
nothing to do with it.

1240
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:42,156
It was all me. I cheated.

1241
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,292
I expect you off
campus by tomorrow.

1242
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:47,962
Yes, ma'am.

1243
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,165
You're a disgrace
to this university

1244
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,436
and your family name.

1245
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,343
What's going on?

1246
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,878
Someone broke
into the door lab!

1247
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:03,711
What?

1248
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:07,882
Oh, no.

1249
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:16,057
Open the door!
Don't go in there!

1250
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:56,465
You look funny.

1251
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:00,101
What?

1252
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:08,076
I'm so tired.
What's going on?

1253
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:09,517
It's the middle of the night.

1254
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,011
A little funny green guy.

1255
01:19:23,493 --> 01:19:25,760
I want to touch it!
It's so cute!

1256
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:30,297
James!

1257
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:36,304
No one goes near that door
until the authorities arrive.

1258
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:37,239
You don't think
that could be...

1259
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,373
It's Mike.

1260
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:39,456
But he could die out there!

1261
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,813
James, wait!
We can help.

1262
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:48,984
Leave it to
the old master of sales.

1263
01:19:48,985 --> 01:19:49,518
We got a call in, but
that's the best we can do.

1264
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:51,286
Ahem!

1265
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:55,290
Don Carlton, sales. Folks,
today is your lucky day.

1266
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,493
How many times have you asked
yourself the following question...

1267
01:19:57,494 --> 01:19:59,026
Arrest him.
Pardon?

1268
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:01,430
Spread them, pops!

1269
01:20:01,431 --> 01:20:02,898
Do you mind?
Don't move!

1270
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:04,299
What? Sullivan!

1271
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,221
Don't you dare!

1272
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,289
Sullivan! Don't go in there!

1273
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:15,910
Mike?

1274
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,415
Mike!

1275
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:21,283
The kids said they
saw something in the cabin.

1276
01:20:21,284 --> 01:20:22,217
They're calling it an alien.

1277
01:20:22,218 --> 01:20:23,819
It was!

1278
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,086
I saw a little green guy!

1279
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:27,021
What's the problem, ma'am?

1280
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:35,129
Mike?

1281
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:40,403
Bear!
A bear in the camp!

1282
01:20:40,404 --> 01:20:41,564
Call this in to headquarters.

1283
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:51,378
Down this way.
All right?

1284
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,519
I heard something over here!

1285
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:02,857
Mike!

1286
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,900
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you out of here.

1287
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,369
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry.

1288
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,541
You were right. They
weren't scared of me.

1289
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:26,214
I did everything right.

1290
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,514
I wanted it more than anyone.

1291
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:33,120
And I thought... I thought
if I wanted it enough,

1292
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,958
That Mike Wazowski
is something special.

1293
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:41,896
And I'm just

1294
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:44,598
not.

1295
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,975
Look, Mike,
I know how you feel.

1296
01:21:53,976 --> 01:21:55,577
Don't do that!
Please, don't do that!

1297
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:57,012
You do not know how I feel.

1298
01:21:57,013 --> 01:21:58,980
Mike, calm down.

1299
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,082
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.

1300
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,351
You can mess up
over and over again

1301
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:05,086
and the whole world loves you.
Mike...

1302
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,455
You'll never know
what it's like to fail

1303
01:22:06,456 --> 01:22:08,356
because you were
born a Sullivan!

1304
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:09,691
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.

1305
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:11,526
I'm the Sullivan
who flunked every test.

1306
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:13,295
The one who got kicked out
of the program,

1307
01:22:13,296 --> 01:22:15,363
the one who was so afraid
to let everyone down

1308
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:17,065
that I cheated.

1309
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:17,998
And I lied.

1310
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:23,671
Mike, I'll never know
how you feel,

1311
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,448
but you're not
the only failure here.

1312
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:36,183
I act scary, Mike,
but most of the time

1313
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,119
I'm terrified.

1314
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,587
How come you never
told me that before?

1315
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:56,370
Because

1316
01:22:58,106 --> 01:22:59,640
we weren't friends before.

1317
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:06,581
Check the lake!

1318
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:07,503
I heard something here!

1319
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:10,384
This way!

1320
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:17,658
I saw movement!

1321
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:19,326
Over there!

1322
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:36,076
Sulley!

1323
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,211
He's cornered!

1324
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:53,428
No!

1325
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:57,232
They're still in there!

1326
01:23:57,233 --> 01:24:00,168
Until the authorities arrive,
this door stays off!

1327
01:24:00,169 --> 01:24:02,804
No! You can't
do that! No!

1328
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:06,508
Enough! I want
this room cleared now!

1329
01:24:06,509 --> 01:24:07,830
You can't do this!

1330
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:20,561
We got to get out of here!

1331
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,626
Let them come.
What?

1332
01:24:24,627 --> 01:24:26,429
If we scare them,
I mean really scare them,

1333
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:27,829
we could generate enough scream

1334
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:29,564
to power the door
from this side!

1335
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,166
What are you talking about?

1336
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:32,300
I have read every book
about Scaring ever written.

1337
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:33,635
This could work!

1338
01:24:33,636 --> 01:24:35,570
They're adults.
I can't do this.

1339
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:36,892
Yes, you can.
Just follow my lead.

1340
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:09,670
<i>Mama!</i>

1341
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:12,307
<i>Mama!</i>

1342
01:25:12,308 --> 01:25:13,841
<i>Mama...</i>

1343
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:29,723
What the...

1344
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:35,529
Now what?
Phase two.

1345
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,706
Keep together.

1346
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:50,812
Are you ready?

1347
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:52,881
Mike, I can't.
Yes, you can.

1348
01:25:52,882 --> 01:25:54,522
Stop being a Sullivan
and start being you.

1349
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:57,152
Call for backup.

1350
01:25:57,153 --> 01:25:58,520
Assistance on the north side.

1351
01:25:58,521 --> 01:26:01,322
Repeat, we need assistance
on the north side.

1352
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,757
<i>Ranger,
answer me, what's your 20?</i>

1353
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:05,360
We need assistance on the north side.
We have a...

1354
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:06,261
Look! What was it?

1355
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:08,595
Let's go.

1356
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:44,631
Sulley, come on!

1357
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:12,226
How?

1358
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:15,502
How did you do this?

1359
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:17,432
Don't ask me.

1360
01:27:26,475 --> 01:27:28,243
Move, move, move! This
is a 54-23 in progress.

1361
01:27:28,244 --> 01:27:29,344
All right,
everybody, clear out.

1362
01:27:29,345 --> 01:27:31,012
Secure the perimeter.

1363
01:27:31,013 --> 01:27:32,646
No child breach.
Repeat: no child breach.

1364
01:27:33,482 --> 01:27:35,250
You ruined our doors!

1365
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:37,385
I've been working on
my door all semester!

1366
01:27:37,386 --> 01:27:38,454
Let's go, you two.

1367
01:27:38,455 --> 01:27:39,621
You're alive!

1368
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:40,703
We are so glad you're safe.

1369
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:45,793
Hey, wait!

1370
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:50,798
That's for the
university president to decide.

1371
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:54,436
But you can be sure we'll
be watching these two.

1372
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:55,936
Always watching.

1373
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:02,776
Expelled?

1374
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:06,848
So, you're leaving?

1375
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:08,715
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.

1376
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:12,020
Harsh, man.

1377
01:28:12,021 --> 01:28:14,423
I'm sorry, guys. You'd be
in the Scaring program

1378
01:28:14,424 --> 01:28:15,624
right now if it wasn't for us.

1379
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:20,361
What?

1380
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:22,563
Well, it is
the gosh-darnedest thing.

1381
01:28:22,564 --> 01:28:23,931
Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.

1382
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:25,800
What?

1383
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,802
She was impressed with our
performance in the games.

1384
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:30,071
She invited us to
join next semester!

1385
01:28:30,072 --> 01:28:32,874
Congratulations, guys!

1386
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,842
And that's not the
only piece of good news.

1387
01:28:34,843 --> 01:28:36,009
Sherrie and I are engaged!

1388
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:39,714
Oh. Who is Sherrie?

1389
01:28:39,715 --> 01:28:41,616
She's my mom.

1390
01:28:41,617 --> 01:28:44,319
Well, if it isn't my
two favorite fellas!

1391
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,787
Come here.
Give me some sugar.

1392
01:28:45,788 --> 01:28:46,553
Oh!

1393
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:49,324
Ugh! So uncomfortable.

1394
01:28:49,325 --> 01:28:51,326
Oh, come on, Scott.

1395
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:53,528
I don't want you to think
of me as your new dad.

1396
01:28:53,529 --> 01:28:54,962
After all, we're
fraternity brothers first.

1397
01:28:54,963 --> 01:28:56,764
This is so weird.

1398
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:58,566
Just think of me
as your big brother

1399
01:28:58,567 --> 01:28:59,634
that's marrying your mother.

1400
01:28:59,635 --> 01:29:01,069
Wait. Hold on.

1401
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:03,971
We're brothers who share
the same mom slash wife.

1402
01:29:03,972 --> 01:29:04,738
That's worse.

1403
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:08,548
Well, I guess
we should be going now.

1404
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:12,480
Promise me
you'll keep in touch.

1405
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,706
You're the scariest bunch
of monsters I have ever met.

1406
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:26,026
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

1407
01:29:52,488 --> 01:29:55,088
So, what now?

1408
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:00,828
You know, for the first time in my
life, I don't really have a plan.

1409
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:03,397
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.

1410
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:07,914
I think it's time I leave the
greatness to other monsters.

1411
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:10,570
I'm okay just being okay.

1412
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:20,814
So long, Sull.

1413
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:23,418
So long.

1414
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:52,180
Wazowski!

1415
01:30:52,181 --> 01:30:53,814
Whoa!
Stop the bus!

1416
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:56,550
Are you crazy?

1417
01:30:57,218 --> 01:30:59,587
Mike,

1418
01:30:59,588 --> 01:31:01,956
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.

1419
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:04,460
I know,
everyone sees us together,

1420
01:31:04,461 --> 01:31:06,761
they think I'm the one running
the show, but the truth is,

1421
01:31:06,762 --> 01:31:09,864
I've been riding your
coattails since day one!

1422
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:11,866
You made the deal
with Hardscrabble.

1423
01:31:11,867 --> 01:31:14,035
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

1424
01:31:14,036 --> 01:31:16,170
All I did was catch a pig!

1425
01:31:16,171 --> 01:31:17,872
Technically, I caught the pig.

1426
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:21,042
Exactly! And you
think you're just okay?

1427
01:31:21,043 --> 01:31:23,578
You pulled off the biggest Scare
this school has ever seen!

1428
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:25,746
That wasn't me!
That was you!

1429
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:27,915
You think I could have
done that without you?

1430
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:30,117
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

1431
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:34,922
Mike, you're not scary.
Not even a little.

1432
01:31:34,923 --> 01:31:36,022
But you are fearless.

1433
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:41,062
And if Hardscrabble can't see
that, then she can just...

1434
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,929
I can just what?

1435
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:48,034
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.

1436
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:49,970
Sorry.

1437
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:51,905
Well, gentlemen,

1438
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:56,176
it seems you made
the front page again.

1439
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,249
The two of you did
something together

1440
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,782
that no one has
ever done before.

1441
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,218
You surprised me.

1442
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:10,892
Perhaps I should keep an
eye out for more surprises

1443
01:32:10,893 --> 01:32:11,958
like you in my program.

1444
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:16,531
But as far as the two
of you are concerned

1445
01:32:16,532 --> 01:32:18,012
there is nothing
I can do for you now.

1446
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:22,035
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.

1447
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:29,943
And, Mr. Wazowski,
keep surprising people.

1448
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:42,790
You know,
there is still one way

1449
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:44,031
we can work at a Scare company.

1450
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:49,629
They're always
hiring in the mailroom.

1451
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:56,671
This is better
than I ever imagined!

1452
01:32:56,672 --> 01:32:58,906
I bet we break the all-time
record in our first year.

1453
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:00,942
Mike, we're mail guys.

1454
01:33:00,943 --> 01:33:03,610
I know. I'm talking about the
record for letters delivered!

1455
01:33:05,614 --> 01:33:08,282
All right, newbies,
quit goofing around.

1456
01:33:08,283 --> 01:33:10,585
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime

1457
01:33:10,586 --> 01:33:12,353
punishable by banishment!
Yes, sir.

1458
01:33:12,354 --> 01:33:14,121
We're right on it,
Mr. Snowman.

1459
01:33:14,122 --> 01:33:15,890
The team of
Wazowski and Sullivan

1460
01:33:15,891 --> 01:33:17,658
are going to change
the world starting today!

1461
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:18,793
Say scream!

1462
01:33:18,794 --> 01:33:19,626
Scream!
Scream!

1463
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,840
Wazowski, good luck
on your first day!

1464
01:34:05,841 --> 01:34:06,941
Thanks, Merv.

1465
01:34:06,942 --> 01:34:07,941
Good luck, Mike!

1466
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:16,783
You coming, Coach?

1467
01:34:18,352 --> 01:34:19,653
You better believe it.

1468
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,875
I made it!
My first day of class!

1469
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,880
Uh, the school year's over, son.
You missed it.

1470
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:11,617
Great.

1471
