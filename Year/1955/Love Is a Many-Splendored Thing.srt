1
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,314
(siren)

2
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,741
Dr Han?

3
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:27,916
Dr Keith would like you to come to
the emergency ward as soon as you can.

4
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,145
(groaning)

5
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,568
- Whas the trouble, John?
- This child was hit by a car and is in shock.

6
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,987
- Who is she?
- A refugee from China.

7
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,533
One of the 3,000 new ones.
They pour in every day.

8
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,201
- Has she a family?
- I don't know.

9
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,705
- She was alone at the time of the accident.
- Will you take over?

10
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,874
I've given her pantopon.
She may be injured internally.

11
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,961
Boy, move her to x-ray immediately.

12
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,506
You had better come along
with me, Officer, for the report.

13
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,346
Dr Han? I am Mei Loo. You remember?

14
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,474
Oh, Mei Loo, I hardly knew you.

15
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,727
Is this the little boy who was so ill?

16
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,605
But now it is my husband.
Make him well, Dr Han.

17
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,110
We have no money, but... we will sell the boy.

18
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:41,448
Our little one is intelligent and well-made.
We come from a good family.

19
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,742
We will do what we can, Mei Loo.

20
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,327
But don't you ever try to sell your little boy.

21
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,955
- You couldn't anyhow.
- I'll take care of him.

22
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,666
Anyway, Dr Sen's on his way down.

23
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,836
- I wish I were ten people.
- You need diversion.

24
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,129
- I wish I were ten people.
- You need diversion.

25
00:04:56,212 --> 00:05:00,008
I'm going to a cocktail party this afternoon.
Why don't you come with me?

26
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,218
Dr Sen will take over here.

27
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,973
Why don't I? A sense of balance
might restore my sense of humour.

28
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:22,113
Why anyone would want to live anywhere
but Hong Kong I can't understand.

29
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,241
Where else could you get
ten servants for the price of one?

30
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,162
By next month, the ratio will be 12:1.
Shanghai's fallen, you know.

31
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,957
- The Reds will have all of China soon.
- We must all keep our heads here.

32
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:38,296
I hope you'll write something dreadful for
your paper about those ungrateful Chi...

33
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,257
Oh! John Keith.

34
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,554
Now my party is a success.

35
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,808
Adeline, this is Han Suyin,
my friend and colleague.

36
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,937
Han Suyin, I feel I've known you
a long, long time.

37
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,358
- You're a great artist, I understand.
- I'm a doctor.

38
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,736
Oh, well, doctors are artists in their way.

39
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,449
I knew I'd heard something wonderful about
you. John, you know everybody, don't you?

40
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:11,329
- Suyin, I hardly expected to find you here.
- Doctor's orders.

41
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,623
Adeline's husband is a hospital director.

42
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,961
You must let me speak to him, Dr Han.
There might be a place for you on the staff.

43
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:22,424
- Thank you, but I am already on the staff.
- Oh, how nice.

44
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,135
Well, then, we won't have to tell him, will we?

45
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,053
I want you to meet Father Lowe.

46
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,556
He just escaped from China, too.

47
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,352
But I haven'tjust escaped from China.
I've been studying medicine in England.

48
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,855
I haven't been back to China for ten years.

49
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,357
- But you are Chinese.
- Eurasian.

50
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,028
My father was Chinese.
My mother was English.

51
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,655
I think of myself as Chinese, however.

52
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,993
I know exactly how you feel. The minute
I put on a Chinese frock, I feel Chinese.

53
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,870
If you have capital invested, you can double
your money in Hong Kong in three months...

54
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,956
If you have capital invested, you can double
your money in Hong Kong in three months...

55
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,375
Money, money, money. Is so sordid, dear.

56
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,920
I want you to meet Dr Han.
This mercenary man is my husband.

57
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,798
- Delighted, Doctor.
- And this is Father Lowe.

58
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,718
- And Mr Beager, Mr Wong and Mr...
- Bohannen, dear.

59
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:11,348
Oh, yes. And Mrs Wong, Madame Monet,
Mr Daney and Fiona Manton.

60
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,975
Father Lowe is fresh out of North China.

61
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,436
All the really nice people are getting out.

62
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,523
- I was thrown out.
- Rice converts, thas what they were.

63
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,443
- Rice converts.
- I loved them.

64
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:27,781
I knew them as I knew the back of my hand.
But they turned me out.

65
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,742
I'm sure I'll find China
much changed when I return.

66
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,371
- You're going back, Doctor?
- Don't tell us you're a Communist!

67
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,291
No, but I became a doctor to help my people.

68
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,961
Like all Chinese,
I'm spellbound by my own country.

69
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,339
- You'll be shot.
- I hope not!

70
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,467
- I'm not a politician or a missionary.
- Really, I must say...

71
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,678
You must say something
to your other guests.

72
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:54,432
- We know. I'll pilot Suyin around.
- Oh, thank you, John, thank you.

73
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:05,318
- Oh, dear, I'm saying all the wrong things.
- Not at all.

74
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,907
- Getting your sense of balance back?
- Yeah. And my sense of humour.

75
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,410
I'd heard that these parties were...

76
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,163
- Oh. I left my fan.
- Where?

77
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,709
Well... I think I put it down
when I was handed a cocktail.

78
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,294
I'll get it for you. Wait here.

79
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:31,636
- Dr Han? Is this yours?
- Thank you.

80
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,930
- And these.
- Thank you.

81
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,724
I'm Mark Elliott.

82
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,227
- Kind of a dull party, isn't it?
- No, thank you.

83
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,397
- Well, I'm a guest, Mr Elliott.
- I'm a guest, too.

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,567
That gives me the right to call it dull.

85
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,944
I was supposed to meet you two weeks ago.

86
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,654
- Were you?
- Mm-hm.

87
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,992
Fred Dixon wrote me,
asked me to look you up.

88
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,370
I didn't as I thought you'd be
an intellectual, with glasses.

89
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,749
Oh. And where is Mr Dixon now?

90
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,917
Oh, he's still in Malaya.

91
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,630
Would you have dinner with me tonight?
I'm a very pleasant man.

92
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,925
Oh, I'm sure of that, but... I'm on duty.

93
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,844
When are you not on duty?

94
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,096
If we were in Chungking, Mr Elliott,

95
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,600
Third Uncle would consider it
unpardonable to accept.

96
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,354
No Chinese girl would dare dine alone
with an American she had just met.

97
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,065
- But we're not in Chungking.
- I am still Chinese.

98
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,026
And half European. I just heard you say so.

99
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,363
Now, will your European side reconsider?

100
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,950
- Why don't you call me at the hospital?
- I'll do that.

101
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:40,622
- Oh, I see you found it.
- Oh, this is Mr Elliott. Dr John Keith.

102
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,292
- We've met before. Nice to see you again.
- Yes. Nice to see you.

103
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,004
I really can't believe
that you're a doctor, Doctor.

104
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,256
What a shame we haven't a scalpel with us.

105
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,718
I could make a slight incision
to convince you.

106
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,057
Tell me about Mark Elliott.

107
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,393
Don't know much. He's a newspaperman.

108
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,688
Been around a couple of months.
A reporter. Why?

109
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,065
He's invited me to dinner.

110
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,652
- Accepting?
- I haven't decided.

111
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:16,491
- He's married, Suyin.
- So are you, John, and I go out with you.

112
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,619
I happen to be in love with my wife. He isn't.

113
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,746
And how do you know so much?

114
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,957
Hong Kong is a small place.

115
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,085
Well, I dislike being a small person.

116
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,171
I'm not remotely interested in Mr Elliott.

117
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,424
I doubt if he'll call anyhow.

118
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,845
(phone rings)

119
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,979
- Dr Han here.
- Are you on duty Wednesday?

120
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,607
I have Wednesday afternoons off.

121
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,404
Good. Is the night of the Moon Festival.
Will you have dinner with me?

122
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,157
- Where can I pick you up?
- Well...

123
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,411
I'll meet you at the staff entrance
of the hospital at six.

124
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:29,647
- You're wearing European clothes.
- My European side is going out with you.

125
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,943
- I don't suppose you'd change?
- I certainly would not.

126
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:39,032
- I love the dress you had on the other day.
- I'll make you a present of it.

127
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:13,525
- So you're a reporter?
- Please, a correspondent.

128
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:17,779
- Whas the difference?
- About a hundred dollars a week.

129
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,719
(chattering in Cantonese)

130
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,316
The ssk is clear.

131
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,985
It is a good omen for the Moon Festival.

132
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,279
I arranged a full moon for you.

133
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:41,654
I arranged a full moon for you.

134
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,035
- Have you ever been in Peking?
- Many times.

135
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:51,164
Do you know that in Peking, the moon
is larger than anyplace else in the world?

136
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,751
Now, thas very unscientific.
Is the same size everywhere.

137
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,129
Oh, no. The moon is larger in Peking.

138
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,590
Much larger than in Hong Kong and London.

139
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,717
All right, if you insist.

140
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,137
When were you in Peking last?

141
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:11,518
I was studying at
the University of Peking in 1939.

142
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:15,271
I'd left by then. I was in England in 1939.

143
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,774
Where were you in 1940?

144
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,652
- Italy.
- I was in Malaya.

145
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:24,614
It seems that destiny never put us
anywhere together at the same time.

146
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:28,410
Perhaps destiny intends
something for us at last.

147
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,537
Oh, I don't think so.

148
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,249
I don't think destiny intends anything for us.

149
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,418
Of that I'm quite sure.

150
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,737
(firecrackers exploding)

151
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,740
(shouting)

152
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,290
- Whas all the noise about?
- A cloud has threatened the moon.

153
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,126
We must make a great noise
to frighten it away,

154
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,879
or the year will be unfavourable.

155
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,965
- You don't really believe that, do you?
- Of course.

156
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:28,803
If we didn't believe the unbelievable,
what would happen to faith?

157
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,972
(firecrackers continue)

158
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,111
You see, the cloud was frightened away.

159
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,280
It is a good omen.

160
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,618
I wonder if there are men on the moon
who celebrate an Earth Festival

161
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,412
and shout to keep the clouds away from us.

162
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,581
I should like to think so.

163
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,840
Thas Maxwell Luderman
over there, the industrialist.

164
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,555
He's just back from Beiping.

165
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,558
I've been trying to get to him for a statement.

166
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,147
Is he really the third-richest
man in the world?

167
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,565
First.

168
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,944
If you want an interview,
why not ask him now?

169
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,571
Oh, I don't think he likes correspondents.

170
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,200
And anyway, I'd like to finish up
our own little interview.

171
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,035
Am I being interviewed?

172
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:38,331
I want to know why you're so sure
that destiny has nothing in store for us.

173
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:42,836
Well, I'm interested only
in one thing: Medicine...

174
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,171
and because I know myself.

175
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:49,884
You sound secure. I doubt
whether anyone is that secure.

176
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,305
I have known but one man in my life.

177
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,685
My husband. He was a nationalist general.

178
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,230
Captured and shot by the Communists.

179
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,985
I believe in the human heart now
only as a doctor.

180
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,320
I bet you're a good doctor.

181
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:13,950
But I still think that destiny might have
something in store for us after all.

182
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,829
- Why?
- Because you've retreated to a tower,

183
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:23,710
and the only trouble with an ivory tower
is is a temptation to lightning.

184
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,213
Lightning will not strike me, Mr Elliott.

185
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,591
Your honourable fish, sir.

186
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,017
Thank you for the moon

187
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,645
and the honourable fish
and the lovely evening.

188
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,397
You're entirely welcome.

189
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,774
I don't know when I've
enjoyed an evening as much.

190
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,234
I don't know when I've
enjoyed an evening as much.

191
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:09,756
- Good night.
- I want to tell you something. I'm married.

192
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,718
- I knew you were married.
- And you still went out with me?

193
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,680
If you were happily married
there could be no danger,

194
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,974
and if you weren't,
it could make no difference.

195
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,935
Will I see you again?

196
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,396
Uh... I think not.

197
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,982
I think so. I'll call you about next Wednesday.

198
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:31,194
- Good night, Suyin.
- Good night.

199
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,267
- Good morning, Dr Sen.
- Good morning, Dr Han.

200
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,690
(speaking Cantonese)

201
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,610
You combine artistry with medicine, Dr Han.

202
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:16,364
Oh, no. Just with love and sympathy.

203
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,533
(speaking Cantonese)

204
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,787
Is a great privilege to watch you.

205
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,956
(speaking Cantonese)

206
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,056
Ten days ago we didn't think she would live.

207
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,351
Look at her now. She will be walking soon.

208
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,978
Have her parents or family been located?

209
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,356
No, but the police are still searching.

210
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:53,026
However, with a million refugees
from China in Hong Kong now,

211
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,153
and more arriving each day, it is like
looking for a needle in a haystack.

212
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,280
And more arriving each day, it is like
looking for a needle in a haystack.

213
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:01,493
Why do they leave China?
What can they expect to find here?

214
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:05,163
- A home.
- Their home is China.

215
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:10,001
We'll mend her bones, make her well enough
to send back into the streets to starve.

216
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:14,631
Oh, no. Not Oh-No.
Someone will give her a home.

217
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,885
Dr Han, Mr Palmer-Jones
would like to speak with you.

218
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,887
Thank you.

219
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,473
Who will in Hong Kong give her a home?

220
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,559
- Or any of the others like her?
- Oh, you can't tell.

221
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,104
I might adopt her myself.

222
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,981
- Good morning, Mr Palmer-Jones.
- Dr Han.

223
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:35,068
My wife says that nobody has
been near her this morning.

224
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:40,448
I'm sorry. I suppose we are late. The wards
are so crowded, we haven't caught up yet.

225
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,951
- Do you visit the wards first?
- As a rule.

226
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:48,164
I see. Well, would you, as a rule,
be so kind as to look in on my wife first?

227
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,709
Patience is not one of her virtues.

228
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,920
- I'll go in and see her now.
- Thank you.

229
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,090
(sighs)

230
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,102
Good morning, Mrs Palmer-Jones.

231
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,981
Oh! Oh, I certainly am glad
to see you, Dr Han.

232
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:17,152
The person who brought my breakfast
didn't speak one word of English.

233
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,029
Was it a nice breakfast?

234
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,574
The only thing that was hot
was the orange juice.

235
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,951
I'll have your tray removed.

236
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:37,255
- Ah, the arm looks better.
- Doesn't feel better.

237
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,299
There's hardly any swelling left.

238
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,759
Imagine being bitten by
a centipede in this day and age.

239
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,635
Imagine being bitten by
a centipede in this day and age.

240
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:46,598
- Is so undignified.
- And painful.

241
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,933
I can give you one cheerful bit of news.

242
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,769
- Oh?
- You may go home tomorrow.

243
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,563
Oh, no, no, I can't. I can't possibly.

244
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:57,442
My living room is being painted
and it won't be dry for a week.

245
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,695
- We'll make arrangements.
- Thank you. You're a dear.

246
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,948
I must do something for you.
What would you like?

247
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,868
- A bigger hospital.
- Huh?

248
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,247
You mustn't bite people, Rosie Wu.

249
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,459
I had to give the man an injection.
It was quite painful.

250
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,502
Come on.

251
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,838
Suyin, are you going to town this afternoon?

252
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,884
No, is my Wednesday off.
I think I'm going to dinner. Why?

253
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,930
I was going to ask you to buy me
some snails for my new goldfish.

254
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,973
(man) Dr Han, telephone.

255
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:33,019
- Won't the pet shop send them?
- It hardly seems worth it for two snails.

256
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,856
- Dr Han here.
- Suyin, Mark.

257
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,111
I said I'd call about Wednesday.
I hoped we could dine together tonight,

258
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,947
but I have to fly to Singapore
on an assignment.

259
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,616
I'd postpone it, but the airline
schedule doesn't work out.

260
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,660
Oh, yes, I understand.

261
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:52,914
- If I'm back next week, can we dine then?
- Well, we'll see.

262
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:56,835
When I called you earlier,
they said you were doing a hysterectomy.

263
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:01,297
- Whas a hysterectomy?
- Nothing that would interest you.

264
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:07,095
- You don't mind my calling when I'm back?
- No. No, I don't mind at all.

265
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,264
Do call when you get back.

266
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,064
Will two snails be enough, John?

267
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,734
Hmm? Oh, yes, yes, ample.

268
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,675
Suyin.

269
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,972
Suyin! Are you not Suyin?

270
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,640
Oh, I know you.

271
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:55,143
You're Suzanne.
We went to convent together.

272
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,979
- Yes.
- How nice!

273
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,483
I was sure it was you. Come sit with me.

274
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,616
Another cup, please.

275
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,496
You recognise me after all this time?

276
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,082
Well, you've dyed your hair, but I know you.

277
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,668
That proves you remember me.

278
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,548
Now tell me about yourself.

279
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:29,886
Is been so long,
yet it all comes swiftly back.

280
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,765
I remember the morning you kicked
the mother superior in the shins.

281
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,851
I did not kick Mother Superior.
It was Sister Angela.

282
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,855
And she limped into chapel
to pray for your soul.

283
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,442
And I'm afraid she did not pray hard enough.

284
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:47,278
What has happened to you
since convent days?

285
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,949
I went to a Chinese university for a while.

286
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:55,870
I toured Europe. I married.
My husband was killed.

287
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,039
I finished medicine in England.

288
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:01,167
I'm now a resident doctor
here at the Victoria Hospital.

289
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,794
You never married again?

290
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:06,923
No, as a Chinese widow,
I have become completely unfeeling.

291
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:10,051
I'm afraid my heart is safely dead.

292
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:13,888
Well, I have to be in love to go on living.

293
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,016
Now is an important Englishman.

294
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,977
I pass for English now.
I hope you won't give me away.

295
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,439
Oh, Suzanne, you should
be proud to be Eurasian.

296
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,399
And proud of your Chinese heritage.

297
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:28,319
Nonsense. You can't be two things at once.

298
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:31,364
And I advise you, pass for English
if you decide to go away.

299
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,950
Well, I'm considering going back to China.

300
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:37,996
It would be rather foolish to
pass for English, don't you think?

301
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,414
Well...

302
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,875
- Oh, I must fly away home.
- Oh, must you?

303
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:46,338
Yes. My new love wants me to be
in my flat when he drops by for tea.

304
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:50,091
We only have half an hour together
before he has to have tea with his wife.

305
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:55,096
Is ruining his digestion.
We must see each other soon.

306
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,682
- Call me at the hospital.
- I shall.

307
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,229
Give the waiter please the change.

308
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,859
I always see people as fish.

309
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:12,364
Separated from the rest of the world,
they become unfit to dwell together.

310
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,699
These, the fighting fish.

311
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,495
These, the peaceful.

312
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,375
These have sought safety in darkness.

313
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,670
They've lost their vision
and the light terrifies them.

314
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:29,547
What species am I, John?

315
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:33,093
You're the peaceful. I shouldn't
like to see you become like these,

316
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:36,137
swimming into deep water,
losing your vision.

317
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,807
Now, what do you mean by that?

318
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:44,104
I hear Mark Ellios gone to Singapore.

319
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:48,149
Yes, his paper sent him on an assignment.

320
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,276
Very convenient for him.

321
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,617
Did you know that
his wife lives in Singapore?

322
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:03,998
There seems to be a conspiracy
to arouse my interest in Mark Elliott.

323
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,793
Be careful, lest you succeed.

324
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:25,562
They told me if I'd wait here
that you'd be out sooner or later.

325
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,023
- When did you get back?
- This morning.

326
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,483
Would you like to go swimming
this afternoon?

327
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,069
Is your afternoon off, so work is no excuse.

328
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:37,323
I'd sort of made plans to visit
friends of mine across the bay.

329
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,535
Well, is a lovely day. Couldn't you do both?

330
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,664
Mark Elliott! What in the world
are you doing here?

331
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,375
Oh, I show up in strange places.

332
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:50,045
You promised to keep me
another week, Dr Han.

333
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:53,506
- I kept you as long as I could.
- I forgive you.

334
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,427
I hear you were in Singapore. Your wife
musve been delighted to see you.

335
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,721
Why don't you come up
for tea this afternoon?

336
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:03,350
Did you know that I was
bitten by a centipede?

337
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,769
Yes to the first question, no to the second,

338
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,605
can't to the third and no to the last.

339
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:13,151
Well, I was. If a handsome man like you
bit me, I wouldn't have minded a bit,

340
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,487
but a centipede...

341
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,157
- Do I expect you?
- Sorry, I'm working this afternoon.

342
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,370
Oh. Well, you'll hear from me.

343
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,538
Goodbye, Dr Han.

344
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,796
Are we going swimming?

345
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:36,800
Mark, going out with you once
was harmless enough.

346
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:39,636
I don't want my seeing you to be awkward.

347
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,846
Hong Kong has a peculiar code,

348
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,350
and malice is a pleasant pastime
for women with nothing to do.

349
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,811
Oh. Would it make any difference

350
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:52,691
if I told you that I didn't see my wife
when I was in Singapore?

351
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,069
Six years ago, she said she
never wanted to see me again.

352
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:59,864
She hasn't changed her mind,
and neither have I.

353
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:03,118
Now, will you go swimming with me?

354
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:07,247
- Well, I... I don't know.
- Take your time.

355
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:12,127
You're obviously a woman who's extremely
careful about making up her mind.

356
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:57,422
- (Mark) How's this?
- Oh, beautiful.

357
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:00,133
- (Mark) How's this?
- Oh, beautiful.

358
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,266
I'll change.

359
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,152
I, um...

360
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:04,781
I'd like to explain about my wife.

361
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,784
- You did.
- No.

362
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:11,329
I want you to know that
I tried to make a go of it.

363
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,707
I'd like you to believe that.

364
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:18,920
A great many mistakes are made
in the name of loneliness.

365
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:21,631
There's no need to discuss it, Mark.

366
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:25,343
All right, I won't bring it up again.

367
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,721
You're brown. You've been in the sun.

368
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,932
Yes, I've been playing a lot of tennis.

369
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,561
What am I going to do
if you go back to China?

370
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:36,813
Play more tennis.

371
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,941
You're not really going back
to Chungking, are you?

372
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:43,111
It wouldn't be good for you
to see too much of me anyhow.

373
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,529
Might even be harmful.

374
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:48,491
- Oh? Why?
- I'm Eurasian.

375
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:53,913
The word itself seems to suggest a certain
moral laxity in the minds of some people.

376
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,750
People never think of what words mean.
They feel them.

377
00:31:56,833 --> 00:32:02,297
- You're talking about stupid people.
- Make no mistake, I'm proud to be Eurasian.

378
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,967
I like to think we combine
the best qualities of both races,

379
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:09,179
that we are the answer to race snobbery.

380
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:15,977
Well, you're certainly the answer
to a lot of things for me.

381
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:20,940
Mark, like everyone else in Hong Kong,
you're at loose ends.

382
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:26,279
I think you probably need a love affair,
but I'm not the answer.

383
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:29,574
I will make no mistakes
in the name of loneliness.

384
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:33,036
I have my work and an uncomplicated life.

385
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,830
I don't want to feel anything again, ever.

386
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,792
A moment ago you said
that words had no meanings.

387
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,711
That people have to feel.

388
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:45,340
Les not tax the day with self-analysis.

389
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:48,677
The friends I was going to see
have a house across the bay.

390
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,639
- Shall we swim over and drop in on them?
- Why not?

391
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,762
- You tired?
- No.

392
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:36,975
I just want to drift
and feel the sun on my face.

393
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,811
You know, the last few weeks
I've come alive.

394
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,980
I like it.

395
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:44,357
You've been good for me, Mark.

396
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:48,028
I don't feel that the whole world
is sick any longer.

397
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:50,196
I'm glad.

398
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,143
Well, look!

399
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,394
(laughing) Oh!

400
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:25,023
Why do you look so surprised?
You expected me, didn't you?

401
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:28,318
Yes, but I didn't expect you
to come out of the ocean.

402
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,112
- Nora, this is Mark Elliott.
- How do you do?

403
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:34,115
- Robert and Ann.
- We've met before. I'll get some towels.

404
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,533
- Hi, Ann.
- Hi, Mark.

405
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:38,536
Suyin, I never thought of you
as Venus rising from the sea.

406
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,288
Suyin didn't have anything to wear
so I suggested we swim over.

407
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,165
Suyin didn't have anything to wear
so I suggested we swim over.

408
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:45,960
- I'll get you some dry things.
- And something wet in a glass for you.

409
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:49,214
- Run along. Use my room.
- Thanks.

410
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:54,969
Well, you're a sly one.

411
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:57,555
When did Mark Elliott discover medicine?

412
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:02,852
- I don't know what you mean.
- "I don't know what you mean." Oh, really?

413
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:08,274
Can't two intelligent people enjoy each
other's company and let it rest there?

414
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:11,403
Not if you're Mark Elliott and Han Suyin.

415
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,530
(Nora) Do you like him?

416
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:15,949
I didn't swim across the bay to escape him.

417
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:20,704
(Ann) I knew it. If ever I saw anyone looking
moonstruck in the sunshine, is you.

418
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:24,624
Oh, nonsense. Truth is,
I have no intention of falling in love.

419
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,835
- Listen to her.
- (laughs)

420
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,586
He is a nice human being.

421
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,589
We are friends. I'm going to keep it that way.

422
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:36,594
With everything thas going on,
you think Hong Kong's safe?

423
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:41,057
- Well, is anyplace safe?
- Have you men been talking about us?

424
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:45,145
- No, China.
- Oh. Les forget China.

425
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:47,772
Have some music.

426
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,734
(traditional Chinese)

427
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:55,196
You see, you can't escape. We forget
that China lies just across the hill.

428
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,366
("Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing"
instrumental)

429
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,163
I think that the relationship between
the East and the West should be closer.

430
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:05,040
Don't you, Doctor?

431
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:03,181
You taste of salt.

432
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,142
Mark...

433
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:08,937
There is an old Chinese proverb:

434
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,023
"Do not wake a sleeping tiger."

435
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:14,401
Certainly not in a small boat.

436
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:18,363
- I'm not being facetious.
- Nor am I.

437
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:21,950
I think I'm in love with you.

438
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:24,744
Mark, you don't know about me.

439
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:27,580
You kiss a girl and it doesn't
mean anything to you.

440
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,708
Just a kiss.

441
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,168
But it isn't so with me. I...

442
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,504
I feel...

443
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:40,343
- Not that I don't like you, for I do.
- I wouldn't do anything to upset you.

444
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:43,763
I have never known
any man but my husband.

445
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:48,018
I feel on the brink of something.

446
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:52,105
I don't want to feel this way. It frightens me.

447
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,860
You don't want to catch cold.

448
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:41,196
Suyin?

449
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:45,033
Suyin?

450
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:48,620
Sorry. I was in the midst of an argument.

451
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,747
An argument?

452
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,543
My Chinese side was debating
with my European side.

453
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,629
What about?

454
00:38:57,712 --> 00:38:59,798
Sleeping tigers.

455
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,676
Mark...

456
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:05,929
Could I have a cigarette?

457
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,988
I've never seen you smoke.

458
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,742
I rarely do.

459
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:33,873
You still think we have no destiny together?

460
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,584
I have decided one thing:

461
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:41,006
That you must decide,
for you are stronger than I am.

462
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,634
No, I think you're the strong one.

463
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:48,680
Then you are wrong. For you are gentle,

464
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:52,434
and there is nothing stronger
in the world than gentleness.

465
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:15,749
You know what is going to happen
if we go on seeing each other.

466
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:19,669
I know we're going to
go on seeing each other.

467
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:22,756
You'd better not take me on, you know.

468
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,051
You'd better get away from me while you can.

469
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,261
There's still time.

470
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:36,227
(Suyin) One starts these things
pretending it doesn't matter.

471
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:38,646
Stop worrying, darling.

472
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,149
Where can we meet tomorrow?

473
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:46,321
There's a tree at the top of
the hill behind the hospital

474
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:49,366
and a path leading up from the road.

475
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:53,620
- I will meet you there at five.
- I'll be waiting.

476
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:24,234
(phone rings)

477
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,654
Dr Han here.

478
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,115
Good night.

479
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:33,993
Good night.

480
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:02,374
I'm late. When I didn't see you,
I was afraid you had gone.

481
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:05,043
You're early. We're both early.

482
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:09,047
Give me your hand.

483
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:19,265
(Suyin) Time passes so quickly.
I didn't want to be late.

484
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,935
(Mark) I wasn't thinking about time.

485
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:25,855
How good it is to know a man
who doesn't live his life

486
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,358
measuring time in bits and pieces.

487
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:30,527
I like it so much.

488
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:37,075
Hong Kong. The hoard of ajewel thief.

489
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:50,171
What incredible hands you have.

490
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:53,216
They curve like a Balinese dancer's.

491
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:55,719
I have always been afraid of hands.

492
00:43:55,802 --> 00:44:00,056
Men's hands. I am not afraid of yours.

493
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,193
- Please do not move. Stay very still.
- Why?

494
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:16,740
A butterfly has perched on your shoulder.

495
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:19,951
Is a sign of good luck.

496
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,541
Oh, you shouldn't have turned!
It was a good omen.

497
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:31,296
Why, you're superstitious. And you a doctor!

498
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:33,840
But I was born to superstition.

499
00:44:33,923 --> 00:44:36,009
In China, when a peasant has a son,

500
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:39,387
he dresses him in girl's clothes
and gives him a girl's name

501
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:43,350
because he's afraid that
the jealous gods may take him away.

502
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:46,561
Or if the crop in the field is bountiful,

503
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:49,856
he stands in the ditch and
shakes his head and cries aloud

504
00:44:49,939 --> 00:44:52,150
"Bad rice, bad rice!"

505
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:55,820
He does this to propitiate the gods,
to deceive them.

506
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:59,616
And so it is with me.

507
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:02,369
I should like to deceive the gods.

508
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:05,789
For if they notice me, they may be jealous.

509
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:11,169
We mustn't let the angry gods notice us.

510
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:15,173
- Bad rice, bad rice!
- Be quiet!

511
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:17,342
I am very serious.

512
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,845
So am I.

513
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:35,610
Dr Sen, this gentleman is looking for Dr Han.

514
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:38,947
- Dr Han is on duty.
- Yes, I know,

515
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,616
but she left urgent word
at the office for me to call her.

516
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,495
- Urgent?
- Yes, so I came over. I'm Mark Elliott.

517
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:49,582
- I'm Dr Sen. Will you come with me?
- Thank you.

518
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:59,968
- Dr Han, Mr Elliott to see you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

519
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:03,388
- What are you doing here?
- I got your message at the office.

520
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:07,350
I called. They said you were in surgery,
so rather than wait, I came on over.

521
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:09,519
I didn't mean that urgent.

522
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:12,272
Is all right. Thank you.

523
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:17,402
- Whas happened?
- We can't talk here. I'm just going off duty.

524
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:20,405
- Would you like to see how I live?
- Sure.

525
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:33,460
Magnificent, isn't it?
The warm-water pipes run under my floor.

526
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:37,339
The cockroaches grow enormous
and fight great duels.

527
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:40,425
They thrive on DDT, so I leave them alone.

528
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:43,636
Now I can visualise your surroundings
when I'm not with you.

529
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,640
You look sleepy. You've got marks
of weariness under your eyes.

530
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,726
I do a lot of writing at night

531
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:52,187
so I can spend...

532
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,147
more time with you.

533
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,524
Shall I make you some coffee?

534
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,991
Now, what upsets you? Why did you call me?

535
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:09,037
- I'm going to Chungking in the morning.
- Why?

536
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,749
I received an urgent cable from my uncle.

537
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:16,711
He is the head of my family
since my mother and father died.

538
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:20,465
Something has happened at home.
Something about Suchen.

539
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:23,927
- Who is Suchen?
- A younger sister.

540
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:28,431
I haven't seen her since... for several years.

541
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:31,601
Can't you handle this
without going to Chungking?

542
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:35,271
Mark, it isn't only Suchen.

543
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:38,650
I want to see China again.

544
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:42,445
To see if it is what I really want to go back to.

545
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:46,825
And also I... I think I must
get away from you for a while.

546
00:47:46,908 --> 00:47:49,786
Get away from me? Now, why?

547
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:53,748
To adjust to certain truths
and not let them bother me.

548
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:57,293
Thas foolish nonsense. Unless
you've changed your mind about me.

549
00:47:57,377 --> 00:48:01,881
No. But I can't help asking myself
what I will get out of this

550
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:06,344
except to become
a cheap Hong Kong Eurasian.

551
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,972
That can never be true
and I don't want you to say it.

552
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:11,141
Well, I will say it.

553
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:16,021
Then I've been wrong about you.
I don't understand your thinking.

554
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:19,649
How could you? You're not Eurasian.

555
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,152
Your pride and sense of dignity
are not involved.

556
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:26,281
Of course they are! You're not
something I picked up off the street.

557
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:30,785
- You're oversensitive about being Eurasian.
- I am trying to be sensible.

558
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:34,664
You are an American.
In my heart I am Chinese.

559
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:38,209
You are married. I am a widow.
You are ajournalist,

560
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:41,254
a front-row spectator not directly involved.

561
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:45,383
I am a doctor deeply involved,
with a duty toward my people.

562
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:50,263
- I don't want anything sordid to...
- Sordid?! I'm in love with you.

563
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:52,640
Don't you understand, Suyin? I love you.

564
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:57,187
Oh, Mark. We both know that even
the fat, ugly people of this world

565
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:01,775
believe that being in love makes
them beautiful and justifies everything.

566
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:04,069
I want something better than that for us.

567
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:08,365
While I stand around biting my fingers
until you decide I'm worth the risk.

568
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:12,452
Oh, Mark. Don't let
your male vanity enter this.

569
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:16,331
You don't have to go to Chungking
to rid your conscience of me.

570
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:19,584
- I'll get out now.
- Don't threaten me, Mark.

571
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,837
Thas not a threat.

572
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,536
(speaks Cantonese)

573
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:08,717
- Is this seat occupied?
- Suyin, sit down.

574
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,344
Suzanne, are you going to Chungking?

575
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:15,306
- No, we're going to Kwajalein.
- We?

576
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,684
(in low voice) I'm not alone.

577
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:20,729
We thought it would be better
if we sat separately.

578
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:32,240
He's one of the directors of the hospital.

579
00:50:32,323 --> 00:50:34,659
I'll get your salary raised.

580
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:36,578
Should we seem so friendly?

581
00:50:36,661 --> 00:50:40,040
- He might suspect you're not English.
- Oh, he found out.

582
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:44,836
Thought I was doing it for his sake,
so he bought me this.

583
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:47,339
- Isn't that lovely?
- Is beautiful.

584
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:49,507
These are real diamonds.

585
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:47,065
La-loo.

586
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,070
- Third Uncle.
- Suyin.

587
00:51:52,153 --> 00:51:54,030
Third Aunt.

588
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:59,285
- Cousin Lee Foo.
- May Yin, Cousin Suyin.

589
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:03,957
- Cousin Lee Chung.
- Shaw Fong, Cousin Suyin.

590
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:06,668
Cousin Lee Wong?

591
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:08,837
Yen Feng, Cousin Suyin.

592
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:14,968
We have waited for this moment.

593
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:18,263
We hope that you have
not changed within you.

594
00:52:18,346 --> 00:52:21,599
I am the same,
and you are as I remembered you.

595
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:24,686
- Your face is fuller.
- It was not yesterday.

596
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:27,981
Some of the family thought
that you would be foreign to us.

597
00:52:28,064 --> 00:52:29,858
You do not seem strange.

598
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:33,111
I feel like the locust that
has suddenly cast its shell.

599
00:52:33,194 --> 00:52:37,991
You are at home. We shall now
have tea and speak of absurdities.

600
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:59,429
May we now speak of Suchen, Third Uncle?

601
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:02,057
Suchen has brought disgrace on us.

602
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,642
She has gone to live in
the house of a foreigner.

603
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:10,190
Not 50 yards from our home, she is
living under the protection of this alien.

604
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:11,691
Why?

605
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:15,945
She fears that when the Communists
take over Chungking that she will be shot.

606
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:18,990
She thinks they won't harm her
in the house of a foreigner.

607
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:22,660
Our clan has never begged of foreigners.

608
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:24,829
May I see her, Third Uncle?

609
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:31,294
It has grown dark.
I will send a boy to light the way for you.

610
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:42,263
(Suchen speaks Cantonese)

611
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:45,183
It is I - Suyin, elder sister.

612
00:53:55,985 --> 00:53:58,071
I didn't think you'd come.

613
00:53:59,197 --> 00:54:01,282
Of course I'd come.

614
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:19,884
Now tell me...

615
00:54:20,885 --> 00:54:23,805
What is this disgrace
you've brought on our family?

616
00:54:23,888 --> 00:54:27,892
You accuse me? You have
become a foreigner yourself.

617
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:32,355
You are free. You can return to Hong Kong.

618
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:35,567
Third Uncle will not secure a passport for me,

619
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,571
so I must stay and be shot
when the Communists come.

620
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:42,824
And would you stand under
the protection of the foreigner

621
00:54:42,907 --> 00:54:46,036
and watch if your family was shot?

622
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,955
They could flee. But they will not.

623
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:51,041
I am sick of Chungking.

624
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:56,338
I want to be as free as you to
live my life... and forget China.

625
00:54:57,547 --> 00:55:00,592
If I get you a passport,

626
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:05,847
will you return to the family and
wipe out this obligation to the foreigner?

627
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:08,016
I want only to get away.

628
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:12,187
You will have your passport.

629
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:25,283
Yes?

630
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:27,452
(man speaks Mandarin)

631
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,416
(speaks Mandarin)

632
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:10,578
I couldn't risk letting you get away
from me, so I came after you.

633
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:16,793
Is there someplace where
we can go and talk for a moment?

634
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:25,093
Third Uncle, we would like to go
into the courtyard and talk privately.

635
00:56:25,176 --> 00:56:28,013
Will you graciously grant permission?

636
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:32,267
The night is cool.
I shall have tea waiting to warm you.

637
00:56:48,324 --> 00:56:50,410
Suyin, will you marry me?

638
00:56:51,244 --> 00:56:53,621
But you are not free...

639
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:57,292
I'll get my freedom as soon as we return.

640
00:56:57,375 --> 00:57:01,755
I don't want to make you do
anything that will hurt others.

641
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:04,841
You won't like that.

642
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:07,010
And you won't like me.

643
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:15,852
I want to know if you'll marry me.

644
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:19,439
I will always do what you want me to do.

645
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:22,150
Then is settled.

646
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:23,818
It is settled.

647
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:26,237
Yet I should like permission of my uncle.

648
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:29,532
It would hurt him not to make this gesture.

649
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:42,462
Sit here, Suyin. There, Mr Elliott.

650
00:57:57,435 --> 00:57:59,437
Third Uncle...

651
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:05,527
I respectfully ask your permission
to become the wife of Mark Elliott.

652
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:09,823
- Where would you live?
- In Hong Kong, with Mark.

653
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:15,328
And will you now give up your vow
to medicine for devotion to Mr Elliott?

654
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:19,874
I won't ask Suyin to give up
being a doctor to be my wife, sir.

655
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:26,548
Suyin... you are a Chinese citizen.
When your passport expires,

656
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:30,301
you may not be granted
the right to practise in Hong Kong.

657
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:32,053
Where would you go?

658
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:35,890
If Suyin wanted to practise medicine
in China, I would live here.

659
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:38,852
The new tapestry will be
tightly woven, Mr Elliott.

660
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:41,855
You would not fit into its hard pattern.

661
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:44,566
We can always go to America.

662
00:58:44,649 --> 00:58:46,067
Ah, yes.

663
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:52,073
It can begin in flight,
pull up roots, and wither and die.

664
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:55,744
Third Aunt, do you believe
that this is wrong?

665
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:59,164
You have asked, and I must answer.

666
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:01,541
He is a foreigner.

667
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,835
Well, that I can't change.

668
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:06,880
We are not strange to this problem, Mr Elliott.

669
00:59:06,963 --> 00:59:10,884
Suyin's father left the land of
his ancestors for a European.

670
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:13,595
He left part of his heart.

671
00:59:13,678 --> 00:59:19,059
I would rather face the future without
hope than the present without Mark.

672
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:22,687
Then you must do what you have to do.

673
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:26,149
We cannot stem the tide of change.

674
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:29,903
Leave nothing behind with us, Suyin.

675
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:35,241
Enter this marriage wholeheartedly.

676
01:00:09,901 --> 01:00:15,323
We believe thatjade, if worn long enough,
becomes the person who wears it.

677
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:19,577
They have given me something
of themselves to take away.

678
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,270
Back to earth again.

679
01:00:45,353 --> 01:00:48,440
The sun is out. It is a good omen.

680
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:53,111
We don't have to worry about omens.
Fate isn'tjealous of us.

681
01:00:57,574 --> 01:01:01,077
At the airport, I'll make arrangements
to fly on to Singapore.

682
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:02,954
At once?

683
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:06,291
This is something I can't handle
in a letter. I have to see her.

684
01:01:06,374 --> 01:01:10,128
Of course. I will test myself at missing you.

685
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:13,798
You bite your nails.

686
01:01:14,966 --> 01:01:16,468
Yes, I know.

687
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:19,804
If you stop, it will be because
you are completely peaceful

688
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:22,098
and completely mine.

689
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:28,229
(stewardess) Will passengers make sure
to take possessions as they leave the plane?

690
01:01:30,106 --> 01:01:32,192
That means you.

691
01:01:38,073 --> 01:01:42,452
You've changed since I last saw you.
You're radiant. Beautiful.

692
01:01:42,535 --> 01:01:44,621
Is Mark.

693
01:01:45,955 --> 01:01:49,084
And you used to be so shy and inhibited.

694
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,543
Is Mark.

695
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:53,088
Don't keep saying "Is Mark, is Mark",

696
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:56,841
- as if is never happened to anyone before.
- Not to me.

697
01:01:56,925 --> 01:02:01,137
- When does Mark get back?
- As soon as he's settled about his divorce.

698
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:03,223
Fat chance he has of getting it.

699
01:02:03,306 --> 01:02:06,184
- Why do you say that?
- I'm a realist. I've met his wife.

700
01:02:06,267 --> 01:02:10,271
She doesn't want him, but will hold onto him
until she finds someone she wants.

701
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:13,817
Well, I think Mark will come back
free to marry Suyin.

702
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,862
Ann, being Mark, would you
give up so much to marry me?

703
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:20,740
No, I wouldn't.
I consider it quite idiotic of him.

704
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:24,244
And idiotic of you, too. After all,
you're quite happy as you are.

705
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:27,080
Oh, well, why spoil everything anyhow?

706
01:02:27,163 --> 01:02:29,708
All the fun goes out when you get serious.

707
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,043
You must admit is difficult for Mark.

708
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:35,213
And your being Chinese doesn't
make it any easier for him.

709
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:38,925
- You talk too much.
- You all talk too much.

710
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:42,887
(Robert) Suyin, is the hospital.
There's a cablegram for you.

711
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:50,270
Dr Han here.

712
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:53,064
Read the cablegram to me, please.

713
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:01,072
Thank you.

714
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,168
(Nora) Well, what is it, darling?

715
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:15,587
- It was Mark.
- What did he say?

716
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:22,510
He said "I have stopped
biting my fingernails."

717
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:25,221
(sobs)

718
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:46,052
- Mark...
- She won't release me.

719
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:49,055
I guessed as much when I saw your face.

720
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:51,683
What are we going to do, Suyin?

721
01:04:51,766 --> 01:04:55,520
I had prepared myself
for the possibility of failure.

722
01:04:55,603 --> 01:04:57,731
Nothing is different.

723
01:04:57,814 --> 01:05:01,818
I am as much to you
as the pleasure I bring you.

724
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:06,364
When I sent you the cable,
she had agreed to the divorce.

725
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:09,034
Then later she changed her mind.

726
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:20,128
You're quite right. Nothing is different.

727
01:05:20,211 --> 01:05:24,174
We can still hope that
she will change her mind again.

728
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:40,982
Mark, go home and rest.
I will see you tomorrow.

729
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:13,932
You didn't get enough sleep, did you?

730
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:16,101
How can you tell?

731
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:18,937
I can tell whether you've had enough sleep

732
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:22,774
or worked too hard or had enough to eat.

733
01:06:23,483 --> 01:06:26,027
I found a cable waiting.

734
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:29,155
I have to go to Macao on a story.

735
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:31,366
Oh, of course.

736
01:06:35,578 --> 01:06:37,664
Then you must go.

737
01:06:38,581 --> 01:06:41,584
But I don't want to be
away from you for a week.

738
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:43,753
You won't be far.

739
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:47,007
But a whole week, Suyin.

740
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:56,641
Do you think you could
join me in a few days?

741
01:06:58,309 --> 01:07:01,312
Yes. I'll arrange it.

742
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:05,734
Now, darling, if you think
is unwise, I'll understand.

743
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:09,779
To go on living, one must
be occasionally unwise.

744
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:13,950
- Why are you smiling?
- Oh, I don't know.

745
01:07:15,326 --> 01:07:18,246
The way you walk, the way you talk.

746
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:20,415
Everything about you.

747
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,835
I love you, Suyin.

748
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:34,846
(phone rings)

749
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:39,059
- Dr Han here.
- Oh, Dr Han?

750
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:41,644
This is Adeline Palmer-Jones here.

751
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:43,855
Could you come over this morning?

752
01:07:43,938 --> 01:07:48,401
Oh... Would you mind
if Dr Sen came instead?

753
01:07:48,485 --> 01:07:50,862
I'm going on holiday. I was just leaving.

754
01:07:50,945 --> 01:07:54,616
Well, it is important. I sprained my ankle.

755
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:58,870
Very well. I'll stop by on my way to the boat.

756
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:12,676
(speaking Cantonese)

757
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:23,478
Oh... It was nice of you to come, Dr Han.

758
01:08:25,605 --> 01:08:28,650
- I don't understand. I thought...
- I didn't sprain my ankle.

759
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:31,653
I wanted to talk to you. Won't you sit down?

760
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:37,450
I have a taxi waiting, Mrs Palmer-Jones.
I'm catching the boat for Macao.

761
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:41,079
Thas what I want to talk
to you about. Sit down.

762
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:48,586
Now, no one hates gossip more than I do,
and nobody is more tolerant than I am.

763
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,840
But there are certain conventions
that must be observed,

764
01:08:51,923 --> 01:08:55,844
especially with this...
ticklish situation in China.

765
01:08:55,927 --> 01:08:59,264
And there's been some
ugly talk about you and Mr Elliott.

766
01:08:59,347 --> 01:09:01,307
May I ask what sort of talk?

767
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:03,476
Oh, the usual kind.

768
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,479
Mr Elliott is married, you know.

769
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:09,274
I've known that from the beginning.

770
01:09:10,191 --> 01:09:14,154
Oh. Well, Mr Palmer-Jones feels that

771
01:09:14,237 --> 01:09:18,074
the personnel at the hospital
should not be indiscreet.

772
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:21,870
- I thought I should warn you, my dear.
- Thank you.

773
01:09:23,663 --> 01:09:27,834
Please feel free to call me
if you do sprain your ankle.

774
01:10:04,996 --> 01:10:07,165
- I'm Dr Han.
- Yes, Dr Han.

775
01:10:07,248 --> 01:10:10,418
Mr Elliott telephoned. He will be delayed.

776
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:12,962
(speaks Portuguese)

777
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:15,548
I hope you will be comfortable.

778
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:32,542
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
It isn't often that I do.

779
01:11:34,085 --> 01:11:36,296
You locked yourself in. Why?

780
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:38,465
I locked the world out.

781
01:11:41,509 --> 01:11:46,681
Oh, Mark, I... I don't know
what has happened to me.

782
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:50,894
I'm like a seed, sprouting up, clutching at life.

783
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:54,564
I can hear and... and smell the sun.

784
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:03,573
I am conscious of surfaces and their textures.

785
01:12:04,657 --> 01:12:08,411
I have such an awareness.
Such an awareness.

786
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:13,458
Oh, pity the poor people
with their sad faces,

787
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:16,336
who have missed what we have.

788
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:21,299
You know, I was thinking last night
of that line in Thompson's poem:

789
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:25,345
"'Tis ye, 'tis your estranged faces

790
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:28,765
That miss the many-splendored thing."

791
01:12:28,848 --> 01:12:31,434
I'm so happy, it frightens me.

792
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:34,813
I have a feeling that heaven is unfair

793
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:39,734
and is preparing for you
and for me a great sadness

794
01:12:39,818 --> 01:12:42,821
because we have been given so much.

795
01:12:45,156 --> 01:12:48,785
Darling, whatever happens,
always remember:

796
01:12:48,868 --> 01:12:52,247
Nothing is fair nor unfair under heaven.

797
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:54,416
(traditional Chinese)

798
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:15,937
Is a funeral procession.

799
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:19,107
They make it seem so festive.

800
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,444
He was a good man... who had a good life.

801
01:13:23,361 --> 01:13:25,030
Are you making that up?

802
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,699
No. The sign they carry says so.

803
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:38,084
I've always wondered why
the relatives walk in the enclosure.

804
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:40,253
They hide their grief.

805
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:49,512
Oh, how good it is to be alive.

806
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:02,567
Two men in the lift are former generals,
old friends of my family.

807
01:14:04,235 --> 01:14:07,489
- They didn't speak to you.
- They realised I was here to see you.

808
01:14:07,572 --> 01:14:10,617
It would have been not polite to speak.

809
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:13,078
- Good evening, señor.
- Table for two, please.

810
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:15,580
Did you book a reservation?

811
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:17,123
No.

812
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,419
This way, please.

813
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:46,695
(speaking Spanish)

814
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:54,327
Mr Elliott. You do not want this table.
I can get you a nicer one.

815
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:56,204
No, is all right, Mr Vicente.

816
01:14:56,287 --> 01:15:00,083
This is Dr Han. Mr Vicente is the proprietor.

817
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:02,002
A doctor? Business good?

818
01:15:02,085 --> 01:15:03,962
I'm not in private practice.

819
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:08,258
Too bad. Ought to make money now. Woman
doctor - make your fortune in no time.

820
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:11,302
Men do not like their wives
to be seen by men doctors.

821
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:15,265
- You stay in Macao.
- I'll consider it. Thank you.

822
01:15:15,348 --> 01:15:17,767
How long will we be in Macao?

823
01:15:17,851 --> 01:15:19,561
Can you stay a week?

824
01:15:19,644 --> 01:15:22,355
I can't... but I will.

825
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:27,193
Do you think we should be seen together?

826
01:15:28,236 --> 01:15:31,156
I want all of my friends to say

827
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:34,784
"Who is that beautiful Chinese girl
Mark Ellios out with?"

828
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:36,161
Eurasian.

829
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,122
The gentleman would like champagne?

830
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:42,751
No. Two very dry martinis. Very dry.

831
01:15:42,834 --> 01:15:44,919
Trust me. The driest.

832
01:15:45,879 --> 01:15:48,256
- Do you know what I'd like to do after?
- What?

833
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:54,054
I should like to go to a Chinese fortune-teller
and listen to his gorgeous lies.

834
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:29,339
(Mark) The lady would like her fortune told.

835
01:16:29,422 --> 01:16:32,550
Fortune written in sand.

836
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:37,389
I would like a lovely fortune, please.

837
01:16:44,562 --> 01:16:45,814
Oh...

838
01:16:47,357 --> 01:16:50,276
Oh, you very lucsk.

839
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,154
Going to own big house.

840
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:55,323
Well, not too big.

841
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:10,046
A-ha, many children.

842
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,881
How many?

843
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:14,676
Oh, ten children. Maybe 15.

844
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:18,096
How many?

845
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:20,890
Oh, too many. Look again.

846
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:23,059
Four children.

847
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:27,480
Will we have a long and lovely life together?

848
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:31,860
Oh... years very hard to tell.

849
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:34,571
Cost more.

850
01:17:36,781 --> 01:17:41,578
I have a feeling he's the one thas
gonna wind up with the big house.

851
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:48,626
Inside box, blue beetle and white beetle.

852
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,920
White beetle, woman; blue beetle, man.

853
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:54,674
If both beetles go to far box,
mean long life together.

854
01:17:54,758 --> 01:17:56,051
You watch.

855
01:18:15,653 --> 01:18:19,616
You have long life together. 87 year.

856
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:24,496
Thank you. Thank you for a happy future.

857
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:28,291
And thank your blessed beetles, too.

858
01:18:50,772 --> 01:18:52,232
There is a cable for you.

859
01:18:52,315 --> 01:18:54,401
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

860
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:03,493
Wait for me here, would you?

861
01:19:06,287 --> 01:19:10,834
- What time is the next boat to Hong Kong?
- In about one hour and 50 minutes.

862
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:13,545
- Make reservations for me, please.
- Yes, sir.

863
01:19:19,175 --> 01:19:21,344
But why Korea?

864
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:25,932
North Korea invaded the South,
crossing the 38th Parallel last night.

865
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:29,144
There isn't much time. We'll have to pack.

866
01:19:30,228 --> 01:19:32,564
Is only a little war, isn't it?

867
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:34,733
Is hard to tell.

868
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:38,069
Will it last long?

869
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:40,155
Oh, I don't think very long.

870
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:42,741
Couple of weeks. Maybe three.

871
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:46,828
Could you possibly not go?

872
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:51,833
No, I could not possibly not go.

873
01:19:53,084 --> 01:19:55,170
I thought not.

874
01:19:56,838 --> 01:20:00,675
Our gorgeous lie did not even last the night.

875
01:20:13,688 --> 01:20:15,857
I'm going to the news office.

876
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:19,486
I'll call you the moment I get any information.

877
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:40,548
Oh... Well, good morning, Dr Han.

878
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,634
Good morning, Mrs Palmer-Jones.

879
01:20:42,717 --> 01:20:45,553
Did you enjoy your trip to Macao?

880
01:20:45,637 --> 01:20:47,138
Yes, thank you.

881
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:50,183
We had an explosion in the harbour
while you were away.

882
01:20:50,266 --> 01:20:52,143
You were badly needed here.

883
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:55,689
My husband was most
disturbed at your absence.

884
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:58,983
Well... is nice that you're back.

885
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:05,990
- Good morning, Dr Han.
- Good morning, Dr Sen.

886
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:09,077
Did she tell you?

887
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,080
Yes. I'm sorry I wasn't here in the emergency.

888
01:21:12,163 --> 01:21:16,001
Did she tell you that your residency
here is not being renewed?

889
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:17,335
No.

890
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:23,008
Well, that isn't too important.
But I should have been here.

891
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:26,928
Do you think that is the real reason
you're being dismissed?

892
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:30,807
No. It is because you are Eurasian.

893
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:32,976
Oh, no, I doubt that, Sen.

894
01:21:33,935 --> 01:21:36,730
Anyway, this isn't the only
hospital in Hong Kong.

895
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:40,066
You will not be offered another residency.

896
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:42,569
Then I'll go into private practice.

897
01:21:42,652 --> 01:21:46,322
Do you think the English will seek you out?
They turn to their own kind.

898
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:49,075
That should not be your concern, Sen.

899
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:53,997
Go back to China, Suyin. There you
will be given a hospital of your own.

900
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,166
Go back to China.

901
01:22:06,634 --> 01:22:08,595
I think she's put on a bit of weight.

902
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:11,306
Soap and affection
make a world of difference.

903
01:22:11,389 --> 01:22:13,975
She's being discharged in my care.

904
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:17,812
Haven't you enough problems already?

905
01:22:17,896 --> 01:22:21,149
This is Dr Han. I'm expecting a call.

906
01:22:21,232 --> 01:22:24,235
When it comes, will you
ring me here, please?

907
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:26,029
Thank you.

908
01:22:26,112 --> 01:22:28,198
Extension 3-1.

909
01:22:29,032 --> 01:22:31,659
How do you say "Take a deep breath"?

910
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:33,912
Wouldn't it be better if she sang for you?

911
01:22:33,995 --> 01:22:35,663
Yes, it would.

912
01:22:35,747 --> 01:22:36,873
(speaks Cantonese)

913
01:22:36,956 --> 01:22:39,876
(singing "Frere Jacques" in Cantonese)

914
01:22:50,512 --> 01:22:52,597
(phone rings)

915
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,517
Dr Han here.

916
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,687
Suyin, I've just been notified
about transportation.

917
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:01,064
Can you meet me in a half an hour?

918
01:23:01,147 --> 01:23:03,900
Yes. I'll meet you at the airport.

919
01:23:03,983 --> 01:23:07,654
No, I don't want to say goodbye at the airport.

920
01:23:07,737 --> 01:23:10,490
On the hill, in half an hour, darling.

921
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:15,203
Mm-hm.

922
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:21,376
How do you turn her off?

923
01:23:23,294 --> 01:23:25,422
(speaks Cantonese)

924
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,105
Give me your hand.

925
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:58,079
Every woman in love
should have a secret garden.

926
01:23:58,163 --> 01:24:00,832
And every man in love
should have a mountain.

927
01:24:00,915 --> 01:24:05,754
Mark... do you remember
the man you wanted to interview?

928
01:24:05,837 --> 01:24:10,008
The one you said was the first
richest person in the world.

929
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:13,386
- Well, he isn't.
- You are.

930
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:17,640
- How did you know?
- I've learned to read your mind, too.

931
01:24:25,732 --> 01:24:28,526
In the next life, let us be birds.

932
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:31,821
According to the laws of reincarnation,

933
01:24:31,905 --> 01:24:34,783
in the next life I will be a woman
and you will be a man.

934
01:24:34,866 --> 01:24:38,036
Oh, no. I refuse to be a man.

935
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:40,955
You have reconciled me to being a woman.

936
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:43,625
All right, I'll take you as you are.

937
01:24:44,834 --> 01:24:50,173
I'm sure I should go as limp at the sight
of you in the next life as I do in this one.

938
01:24:53,134 --> 01:24:57,055
What sort of things will
you write about in Korea?

939
01:24:57,138 --> 01:25:01,810
Oh, the same sort of things
I wrote about in Africa, Indonesia.

940
01:25:01,893 --> 01:25:04,688
The cold facts of war.

941
01:25:04,771 --> 01:25:10,068
The other things that tell of
men afraid, men suffering,

942
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:13,279
people caught up in events
they can't understand.

943
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:17,492
Mark, do correspondents ever get killed?

944
01:25:17,575 --> 01:25:18,827
Mm-hm.

945
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:22,038
Friend of mine got killed by a bus in Tosko.

946
01:25:24,165 --> 01:25:26,876
If anything happens to you,

947
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,671
I shall give up medicine.

948
01:25:29,754 --> 01:25:32,674
I would hate my fellow man
too much for having hurt you.

949
01:25:32,757 --> 01:25:35,552
Then I would be the worst thing
that happened to you.

950
01:25:35,635 --> 01:25:37,721
And I would know it.

951
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:45,103
- What time should you leave?
- Ten minutes ago.

952
01:25:48,815 --> 01:25:51,693
War has strapped you to a watch.

953
01:25:51,776 --> 01:25:55,321
Unfortunately, my plane leaves on schedule.

954
01:25:57,741 --> 01:26:01,911
I wanted to bring you a present,
but there wasn't time.

955
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:04,414
You know I've never given you anything?

956
01:26:04,497 --> 01:26:08,376
Oh, Mark, what a wrong
and dreadful thing to say.

957
01:26:10,378 --> 01:26:12,547
What a nice thing to reply.

958
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:16,718
I have to go now,
and I don't want you to be sad.

959
01:26:16,801 --> 01:26:20,555
I won't be sad. Sadness is so ungrateful.

960
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:25,143
And I don't want you to
come down the path with me.

961
01:26:25,226 --> 01:26:27,812
I want to look back and see you here.

962
01:26:28,855 --> 01:26:32,609
I will be here when you
come back to me, I promise.

963
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:55,965
Remember the blue beetle?
It promised us a long and happy life.

964
01:27:29,582 --> 01:27:31,668
Nora, this is Suyin.

965
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:38,633
Mark is gone, and I've lost
my position here at the hospital.

966
01:27:38,717 --> 01:27:41,052
Could I stay with you for a while?

967
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:43,304
Oh, for goodness sake, Suyin.

968
01:27:43,388 --> 01:27:45,932
Come and stay as long as you like.

969
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:48,810
And could I bring my little Oh-No with me?

970
01:27:48,893 --> 01:27:51,312
We both have a need
for friends at the moment.

971
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:56,651
You bring Oh-No, Third Uncle,
Nine Aunt, anyone you want.

972
01:27:56,735 --> 01:27:59,112
Thank you, Nora. It won't be for long.

973
01:27:59,195 --> 01:28:00,447
(knock on door)

974
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,198
Come in.

975
01:28:02,365 --> 01:28:04,868
Yes? Thank you, dear.

976
01:28:04,951 --> 01:28:06,369
Goodbye.

977
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:09,998
- Can I talk to you for a moment?
- Of course, Dr Sen.

978
01:28:10,081 --> 01:28:12,167
(speaking Cantonese)

979
01:28:17,922 --> 01:28:21,217
- When do you leave the hospital, Suyin?
- Tomorrow.

980
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:23,428
In a week I'm returning to China.

981
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:26,056
Have you thought about going back?

982
01:28:26,139 --> 01:28:29,809
- I must stay in Hong Kong.
- Because of Mr Elliott?

983
01:28:29,893 --> 01:28:31,603
Yes, as a matter of fact.

984
01:28:31,686 --> 01:28:36,858
So you're willing to sacrifice your country
for a romantic attachment to one man?

985
01:28:36,941 --> 01:28:39,110
- Sen...
- A man who won't even marry you.

986
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:40,695
Where's your pride, Suyin?

987
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:44,491
I will not allow you to make me
feel small, selfish or ashamed.

988
01:28:44,574 --> 01:28:46,659
Forget this man, Suyin.

989
01:28:46,743 --> 01:28:48,828
It is a weakness unworthy of you.

990
01:28:48,912 --> 01:28:51,664
There's no longer any place
in the world for weakness.

991
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:56,294
Then there is no place for doctors, since
our approach to weakness is sympathetic.

992
01:28:56,378 --> 01:28:58,672
But you feel as we do. I have watched you.

993
01:28:58,755 --> 01:29:01,675
You hate the poverty
and the pain you see here.

994
01:29:01,758 --> 01:29:06,096
I hate it everywhere. But that doesn't
make me a Communist like you, Sen.

995
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:08,556
Itjust makes me try to be a better doctor.

996
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,184
China has been reborn, Suyin.

997
01:29:11,267 --> 01:29:13,728
Our people are free at last.

998
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:19,609
Sen, refugees pour into Hong Kong
at the rate of 3,000 a day.

999
01:29:19,693 --> 01:29:22,445
As a man who believes in this new order,

1000
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:25,365
doesn't it disturb you that
so many flee from freedom?

1001
01:29:25,448 --> 01:29:29,327
You're no longer Chinese.
You're not facing the truth.

1002
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:32,539
Look into the mirror and see yourself.

1003
01:29:34,374 --> 01:29:38,253
Maybe that is the difference
in our viewpoints, Sen.

1004
01:29:38,336 --> 01:29:41,631
You look into the mirror
and see truth reflected.

1005
01:29:41,715 --> 01:29:44,259
But I think it is an illusion.

1006
01:29:44,342 --> 01:29:46,970
For in the mirror, what is right is left,

1007
01:29:47,053 --> 01:29:49,139
and what is left is right.

1008
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:54,728
(door slams)

1009
01:30:04,446 --> 01:30:05,947
Ahh...

1010
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:07,907
Ooh. (laughs)

1011
01:30:07,991 --> 01:30:10,076
(speaking Cantonese)

1012
01:30:13,663 --> 01:30:16,374
We drove out to see you
and you weren't home.

1013
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:17,667
Where have you been?

1014
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:20,503
- Job-hunting.
- Any luck?

1015
01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:23,840
Yes, I was offered ajob
typing medical reports.

1016
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:29,596
Suyin, would you go and see
Mr Palmer-Jones if I arrange it?

1017
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:32,223
I wouldn't have a month ago.

1018
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:35,518
- But time has nibbled at my pride.
- I'll call him tomorrow.

1019
01:30:35,602 --> 01:30:38,355
Oh-No. (speaks Cantonese)

1020
01:30:38,438 --> 01:30:40,523
Oh-No!

1021
01:30:46,988 --> 01:30:50,533
You read your letter,
and we'll go in and fix tea.

1022
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:58,208
Is she taking care of herself?

1023
01:30:58,291 --> 01:31:00,335
She looks worried and tired.

1024
01:31:00,418 --> 01:31:02,462
I think she looks wonderful

1025
01:31:02,545 --> 01:31:04,964
for someone with half a heart.

1026
01:31:14,224 --> 01:31:17,686
(Mark) I have received your letters,
number eight and 11,

1027
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:20,230
but nine and ten are missing.

1028
01:31:20,313 --> 01:31:23,650
Wonderful moon at night,
each night a little bigger,

1029
01:31:23,733 --> 01:31:26,069
rising a little farther to the left,

1030
01:31:26,152 --> 01:31:29,781
taking a little longer to
reach the trees on the right.

1031
01:31:29,864 --> 01:31:34,869
Twice, like a ritual,
I read your letter by its light.

1032
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:36,871
Last night, wonder of wonders,

1033
01:31:36,955 --> 01:31:39,499
I not only had a clean camp bed,

1034
01:31:39,582 --> 01:31:42,877
but I was able to place it
so it faced the open window

1035
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:45,046
and our friend, the moon.

1036
01:32:35,013 --> 01:32:37,098
(speaking Cantonese)

1037
01:32:42,145 --> 01:32:44,606
I'm picking up Robert.
Would you like to come?

1038
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:46,483
No, I'll stay.

1039
01:32:46,566 --> 01:32:50,487
- We'll stop at a cake shop for tea first.
- Stop worrying about me.

1040
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:53,865
It is difficult enough when
I think of your kindness to me.

1041
01:32:53,948 --> 01:32:56,242
I'm not kind. I'm just practical.

1042
01:32:56,326 --> 01:33:00,705
With a household full of children,
I just wanted a doctor in the house.

1043
01:33:00,789 --> 01:33:03,291
What on earth are you doing?

1044
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:05,502
I'm making a good-luck prayer for Mark.

1045
01:33:05,585 --> 01:33:08,463
- Oh, Suyin.
- I know it is foolish.

1046
01:33:08,546 --> 01:33:12,175
But I must feel I'm doing
something to protect him.

1047
01:33:12,759 --> 01:33:14,844
(speaking Cantonese)

1048
01:34:03,768 --> 01:34:07,272
(Mark) Glory be! Numbers
nine and ten finally arrived,

1049
01:34:07,355 --> 01:34:09,983
old and worn, but mighty welcome.

1050
01:34:10,066 --> 01:34:12,694
Expect to be in Seoul tomorrow.

1051
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:17,699
My bottom is worn to the bone with
bouncing about in jeeps on bumpy roads.

1052
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:23,079
I used to think I'd run out of
things to write you. More fool I...

1053
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:25,248
(siren wailing)

1054
01:34:35,633 --> 01:34:38,470
(sobbing)

1055
01:34:40,722 --> 01:34:41,723
Oh-No...

1056
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:49,230
(speaks Cantonese)

1057
01:34:56,196 --> 01:34:58,656
(Oh-No speaks Cantonese)

1058
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:02,077
It is no one's fault. These things happen.

1059
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:11,252
(speaking Cantonese)

1060
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:20,095
(radio announcer) UN troops have
withdrawn to positions at Pusan.

1061
01:35:20,178 --> 01:35:24,432
- North Korea is expected to launch...
- Stop listening to that.

1062
01:35:24,516 --> 01:35:26,267
- A letter from Mark.
- Thank you.

1063
01:35:26,351 --> 01:35:29,896
You must have enough letters
from him now to start a bonfire.

1064
01:35:29,979 --> 01:35:34,192
I wouldn't burn them,
but they would make a lovely glow.

1065
01:35:34,275 --> 01:35:37,696
Nora... you know, it often seems that

1066
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:41,866
Mark is with me more while
he is away than when he is here.

1067
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:45,161
- Do you think thas strange?
- Well, no, I don't.

1068
01:35:46,996 --> 01:35:49,624
- Nora.
- Oh, here's Ann.

1069
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:52,919
Nora, come here a minute.

1070
01:35:56,965 --> 01:35:59,676
- What is it, Ann?
- Hello, Ann.

1071
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:04,389
What in the world is the matter?

1072
01:36:04,472 --> 01:36:06,224
There's something in the paper.

1073
01:36:06,307 --> 01:36:09,102
- What?
- Suyin, is about Mark.

1074
01:36:09,185 --> 01:36:12,897
- What about Mark?
- No, don't. Don't, Suyin.

1075
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:15,483
Dead... or a prisoner?

1076
01:36:15,567 --> 01:36:17,569
- He's dead.
- Oh, sweetheart.

1077
01:36:17,652 --> 01:36:19,738
Is not true.

1078
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:24,242
Is not true.

1079
01:36:25,952 --> 01:36:28,705
Nora... is a lie.

1080
01:36:34,044 --> 01:36:36,129
I won't believe it!

1081
01:36:40,633 --> 01:36:44,346
(Mark) I do not know
what is to happen, darling.

1082
01:36:44,429 --> 01:36:47,057
But this I do know:

1083
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:50,769
Life's greatest tragedy is not to be loved.

1084
01:36:51,978 --> 01:36:54,564
God has been good to us, Suyin.

1085
01:37:15,168 --> 01:37:17,504
He is dead.

1086
01:37:17,587 --> 01:37:21,341
But his letters will come... one by one.

1087
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:27,472
They will continue to come

1088
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:30,767
one by one.

1089
01:37:46,324 --> 01:37:51,287
(Mark) Suyin... there is nothing
fair nor unfair under heaven.

1090
01:37:54,582 --> 01:37:57,168
God has been good to us, Suyin.

1091
01:37:59,629 --> 01:38:03,883
It makes me very proud of you to know
that any unhappiness of your own

1092
01:38:03,967 --> 01:38:07,595
could never blind you to the pain of others.

1093
01:38:56,770 --> 01:38:58,855
(Mark) Give me your hand.

1094
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:05,880
I often think that healing is man's salvation,

1095
01:40:05,964 --> 01:40:09,092
and I envy your ability to help.

1096
01:40:09,175 --> 01:40:11,469
You deal with suffering,

1097
01:40:11,553 --> 01:40:14,347
but you can do something about it.

1098
01:40:14,431 --> 01:40:16,725
I can only stand and watch.

1099
01:40:37,078 --> 01:40:40,665
We have not missed, you and I.

1100
01:40:40,749 --> 01:40:44,627
We have not missed that
many-splendored thing.

1101
01:40:44,711 --> 01:40:51,301
Love is a many-splendored thing

1102
01:40:51,384 --> 01:40:58,767
Is the April rose that only grows
in the early spring

1103
01:40:59,684 --> 01:41:03,521
Love is nature's way of giving

1104
01:41:03,605 --> 01:41:07,192
A reason to be living

1105
01:41:07,275 --> 01:41:15,950
The golden crown that makes a man a king

1106
01:41:16,701 --> 01:41:23,083
Once on a high and windy hill

1107
01:41:23,875 --> 01:41:28,421
In the morning mist, two lovers kissed

1108
01:41:28,505 --> 01:41:31,841
And the world stood still

1109
01:41:32,676 --> 01:41:38,223
Then your fingers touched my silent heart

1110
01:41:38,306 --> 01:41:43,353
And taught it how to sing

1111
01:41:43,436 --> 01:41:52,320
Yes, true love's a many-splendored thing

1112
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,491
