1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,400
<i>When you see a guy
reach for stars in the sky</i>

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,700
<i>You can bet that
he's doin' it for some doll</i>

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,800
<i>When you spot a John
waiting out in the rain</i>

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>Chances are he's insane
as only a John can be for a Jane</i>

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,200
<i>When you meet a gent
paying all kinds of rent</i>

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,400
<i>For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal</i>

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,700
<i>Call it sad, call it funny</i>

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,800
<i>But it's better than even money that
the guy's only doin' it for some doll</i>

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,300
<i>Your eyes are the eyes</i>

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,300
<i>Of a woman in love</i>

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,900
<i>And oh how they give you away</i>

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,000
<i>Why try to deny</i>

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,600
<i>You're a woman in love</i>

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,000
<i>When I know very well</i>

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,800
<i>What I say?</i>

16
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,400
I got the horse right here,
the name is Paul Revere

17
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
And here's a guy that says
if the weather's clear

18
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,100
Can do, can do

19
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,900
This guy says the horse can do

20
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
If he says the horse can do

21
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,100
Can do, can do

22
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm pickin' Valentine
cos on the mornin' line

23
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
The guy has got him
figured at five to nine

24
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,600
But look at Epitaph,
he wins it by a half

25
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,700
<i>According to this here in the Telegraph</i>

26
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,800
For Paul Revere I'll bite,
I hear his foot's all right

27
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,800
Of course it all depends
if it rained last night

28
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,800
I know it's Valentine,
the morning works look fine

29
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,800
You know, the jockey's
brother's a friend of mine

30
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,900
And just a minute, boys
I got the feedbox noise

31
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,900
It says the great-grandfather
was Equipoise

32
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,800
I tell you Paul Revere,
now this is no bum steer

33
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,800
It's from a handicapper
that's real sincere

34
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm pickin' Valentine
cos on the mornin' line

35
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
The guy has got him
figured at five to nine

36
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So make it Epitaph,
he wins it by a half

37
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,300
<i>According to this here in the Telegraph</i>

38
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,900
-  Epitaph!
-  Valentine!

39
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Paul Revere!

40
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,000
I got the horse

41
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Right here!

42
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Follow the fold and stray no more

43
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,500
Stray no more, stray no more

44
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,700
Put down the bottle
and we'll say no more

45
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,000
-  Follow, follow the fold
-  Before you take another swallow

46
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,400
Follow the fold and stray no more

47
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,400
Stray no more, stray no more

48
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Tear up your poker deck
and play no more

49
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,300
Follow, follow the fold

50
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,200
Friends, my name is Sarah Brown.

51
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,600
This is no place to make a speech
and I'm not gonna try.

52
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,900
You don't wanna be told
how unhappy you are.

53
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,600
You don't wanna be told
about the emptiness of your lives.

54
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,800
You who drink too much,

55
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,600
you who gamble at cards
and dice and horse racing.

56
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,500
Let us help you not to lose your money
in gambling dens and bookie joints.

57
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,200
- This doll has captured my attention.
- Let us give you strength to stop drinking.

58
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,300
- She has lost me.
- Welcome to the Save-A-Soul Mission.

59
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
- Just around the corner.
- Come to me.

60
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,700
- You're gonna call me a liar.
- A special prayer meeting this Thursday.

61
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,100
Because today I'm givin' away
solid gold watches for one dollar each.

62
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,400
That's right, my friends.
A solid gold watch for one buck.

63
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,900
Remember - all that glitters is not gold.

64
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
More to be desired
are the judgments of heaven.

65
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,400
- Gold is not enough.
- You say it's not enough?

66
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,600
All right. Today only,
I include a nailbrush with a solid ivory top.

67
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,900
Then, my friends, a built-in genuine
magnetic compass. There you are.

68
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,700
When you brush your nails,
do you wonder where you're goin',

69
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,700
north, east, south or west?

70
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,800
Which way are you going?
Down, down, down, or up to salvation?

71
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,800
Come to the mission and find out.
Absolutely free.

72
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,200
Absolutely free. The nailbrush is
absolutely free. Don't crowd. Don't push.

73
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,500
There's plenty of room for everybody.

74
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,800
There's room for everybody
in the kingdom of heaven, too.

75
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,300
Now, folks, I don't care
whether you buy it or not, because I'm...

76
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,500
Let's pack up.

77
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,000
Did you notice how this time a lot of 'em
stayed till halfway through your talk?

78
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,600
If we could only sell them
salvation for a buck -

79
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,800
solid gold, with an ivory top
and a built-in compass.

80
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,100
Sarah, you don't suppose by any chance
those watches could really be solid gold?

81
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,700
Uncle Arvide, don't you dare.

82
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,100
A solid gold watch for one buck.

83
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,800
Harry the Horse!

84
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,300
Benny Southstreet! Since when
do ya yell out the name of a person

85
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,800
- in the open air full of police?
- It was a friendly impulse. I lost my head.

86
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,100
If I do not like you so much
this would now be a fact.

87
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,300
- You know Nicely-Nicely Johnson?
- How goes everything?

88
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,500
Nicely-nicely, thank you.

89
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,300
I have been waitin'
to hear from Nathan Detroit.

90
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,600
What will be the location
of his crap game?

91
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,100
We don't know yet. Nathan's been lookin'
around, but he is very hard to please.

92
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,400
Confidentially, Harry, the heat is on very
hot here, and it is making Nathan sweat.

93
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,600
That's too bad. I would dislike
to take my trade elsewhere,

94
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,500
but I am loaded and lookin' for action.

95
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,200
I've just acquired 5,000 fish.

96
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,400
5,000?

97
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,600
If it can be told, where did you
take on this fine bundle of lettuce?

98
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,000
I have nothin' to hide.

99
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,400
I collected the reward on my father.

100
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,100
It is an advantage
to have a successful father.

101
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Nobody ever wanted my old man
for as much as 500.

102
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,800
I'm worried about Nathan.
Harry the Horse is not the only one.

103
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,800
There's a lotta loose money around
and everybody's lookin' for some action.

104
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,400
If Nathan doesn't find a place...

105
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,700
Why, Lieutenant Brannigan!

106
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,700
Mr Southstreet, it is Lieutenant Brannigan

107
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,800
of the New York City Police Department.

108
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,900
Have either of you seen Nathan Detroit?

109
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,200
- Which Nathan Detroit is that?
- Your boss Nathan Detroit,

110
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,600
the one who runs a floating crap game.

111
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,500
- Floating?
- On a boat?

112
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,700
One that moves to a different spot every
night so the police can't break it up.

113
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,900
- Sounds like a very difficult thing to do.
- You should know.

114
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,400
It's your job to rustle up the customers
and tell them where it is.

115
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,300
Especially with a famous detective
putting on the heat.

116
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,000
And you can give
just that message to Detroit.

117
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,500
Brannigan says he's not going to find
a spot for his crap game

118
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,200
because Brannigan's put on the heat

119
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,700
and Brannigan's breathing
down everybody's neck.

120
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,500
Nathan, you're lucky.
You just missed Brannigan.

121
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,900
- I'm lucky. I missed Brannigan.
- He left a message. He said...

122
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I am not going to find a place
for my crap game

123
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,500
because everybody knows
Brannigan has turned on the heat

124
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,800
and is breathing down everybody's neck.

125
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,100
That's what he said.

126
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,200
You tried the regular places?
Won't they take a chance, seeing it's you?

127
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,700
Seeing it's me, no.
Except one. Joey Biltmore's garage.

128
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,900
Joey said he might take a chance...
for 1,000 bucks.

129
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,100
- 1,000?
- In advance and in cash.

130
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,300
- He would not even take my marker.
- This I do not believe.

131
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,700
Joey Biltmore will not take your marker.

132
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,900
You got no idea what a breath
this Brannigan has got.

133
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
A marker's not just
a piece of paper saying:

134
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,100
"I owe you 1,000.
Signed, Nathan Detroit."

135
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,900
A marker is the one pledge
which a guy cannot welsh on, never.

136
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,500
It's like not saluting the flag.

137
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,900
It does not seem possible.
Me without a livelihood.

138
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,600
Why, I've been running the crap game
since I was a juvenile delinquent.

139
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,900
But, Nathan, the situation is desperate.

140
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,100
- You have got to think of something.
- My only thought costs 1,000 bucks.

141
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,400
I cannot even afford to think.

142
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm broke. I'm so broke I couldn't even
buy a present for Adelaide today.

143
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,000
Is it her birthday?

144
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,500
It is mine and Adelaide's 14th anniversary.

145
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,100
We are engaged 14 years today.

146
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,300
Concentrate on the game.

147
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,500
The town is up to here with high players.
The Greek's in town.

148
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,700
- Brandy Bottle Bates!
- I know, I know.

149
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,300
I could make a fortune,
but to make a fortune I need a fortune.

150
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,400
1,000 bucks!

151
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,400
Where do I get it?

152
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,600
The Biltmore garage wants a grand

153
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,100
But we ain't got a grand on hand

154
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,100
And they now have a lock on the door

155
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,800
To the gym at Public School 84

156
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
There's the stockroom
behind McClosky's Bar

157
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,900
But Mrs McClosky ain't a good scout

158
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And things bein' how they are

159
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,000
The back of the police station is out

160
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,300
So the Biltmore garage is the spot

161
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,100
But the 1,000 bucks we ain't got

162
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,300
Why, it's good old reliable Nathan

163
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Nathan, Nathan, Nathan Detroit

164
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,800
If you're looking for action,
he'll furnish the spot

165
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,100
Even when the heat is on,
it's never too hot

166
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,600
Not for good old reliable Nathan

167
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,700
For it's always just a short walk

168
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
To the oldest-established permanent

169
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Floating crap game in New York

170
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,000
There are well-heeled shooters
everywhere, everywhere

171
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,500
There are well-heeled
shooters everywhere

172
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,400
And an awful lot of lettuce

173
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
For the fella who can get us there

174
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,700
If we only had a lousy little grand

175
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,900
We could be a millionaire

176
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
Good old reliable Nathan

177
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Nathan, Nathan, Nathan Detroit

178
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,300
If the size of your bundle
you want to increase

179
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,700
I'll arrange that you go broke
in quiet and peace

180
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,100
In a hide-out provided by Nathan

181
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,300
Where there are
no neighbours to squawk

182
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
It's the oldest-established permanent

183
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,200
Floating crap game in New York

184
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,600
Where's the action?

185
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,900
Where's the game?

186
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,200
Gotta have the game
or we'll die from shame

187
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,700
It's the oldest-established permanent

188
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,200
Floating crap game in

189
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:49,200
New York

190
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,500
Gentlemen, I am deeply touched
by your faith and loyalty.

191
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,700
Gentlemen, do not worry. Nathan Detroit's
crap game will float again.

192
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,600
Nathan! Guess who's sittin' in Mindy's
right now, eatin' a steak breakfast.

193
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,600
- Hitler.
- Wrong. Sky Masterson.

194
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Sky Masterson's in town. This should be
the greatest crap game of your career.

195
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,700
- Where's it gonna be?
- City Hall. The mayor's office.

196
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,500
- What time?
- We will leave you know, Angie.

197
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,800
Sky Masterson, the highest player
of 'em all. What a spot I'm in.

198
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,800
- Does he bet higher than the Greek?
- Why do you think they call him Sky?

199
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Once, with my own eyes,
I saw him bet 5,000 bucks

200
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,300
that one raindrop'd beat
another raindrop down the window.

201
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,300
Once he was sick
and would not take penicillin.

202
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,700
He bet his fever would go to 104.

203
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,000
- Always makes crazy bets like that.
- Did he win?

204
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,300
Him and his crazy bets.
He got lucky. It went to 106.

205
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,700
So why don't I bet him?

206
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,800
Why don't I bet him
1,000 bucks on somethin'?

207
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,400
Max, what's the matter no Danish today?

208
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,100
It's a holiday in Denmark. How do I know?

209
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,800
- For years you been bringing me Danish.
- So we ain't got Danish today.

210
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm bringing you cheesecake.
You want strudel, I'll bring strudel.

211
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,900
- I don't like strudel.
- So eat the cheesecake.

212
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,100
Live it up a little!

213
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,500
I do not understand you. Everyone's crazy
about Mindy's cheesecake and strudel.

214
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,000
They must sell thousands
of portions every day.

215
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,800
That's just it.
Everybody's on cheesecake and strudel.

216
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,000
Makes me feel like
I'm playing the favourite.

217
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,500
Playing the favourite...

218
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,800
Nicely, Benny, go into the kitchen
and find out exactly how many pieces

219
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,100
of cheesecake they sold yesterday -
also how many pieces of strudel.

220
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,000
How much cheesecake?
How much strudel?

221
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,200
What do you wanna know for?

222
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm investigatin' for the FBI. Go!

223
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,500
Brannigan! Stop breathing down my neck.

224
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,100
- Why, Nathan!
- Adelaide. Doll!

225
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Nathan, how could you think
I was Lieutenant Brannigan?

226
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,800
We don't even use the same perfume.

227
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,700
I was kinda daydreaming, I guess.

228
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,500
I don't dream about detectives,
Nathan, even in the daytime.

229
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Do you know what I dream about? You.

230
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,100
And your career as a businessman
in a normal business.

231
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,000
And our career together
as a normal husband and wife.

232
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,800
Gesundheit. Your cold does not seem
to be getting any better.

233
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,500
It comes and goes, comes and goes.
It's just a chronic condition.

234
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,000
Even if it is, it sure hangs on.

235
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,500
Nathan... speaking of chronic conditions...

236
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,100
Happy anniversary.

237
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Guess what's inside.

238
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,600
- 1,000 bucks?
- I only wish it was.

239
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,300
Go on. Open it up.

240
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,500
"Mr Nathan Detroit. General Manager."

241
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,000
- General manager of what?
- Whatever you set your mind on, Nathan.

242
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,400
I have faith.

243
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,100
Adelaide, I...

244
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,400
I do not have a present for you.

245
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,700
Oh, I don't mind, Nathan,
if you don't give me a present.

246
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,800
It makes me feel like we were married.

247
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,800
Nathan, darling, there isn't anything
I couldn't do without.

248
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,900
Just as long as you don't start
running that crap game again.

249
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,600
Crap game? Adelaide.
Didn't I promise you?

250
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,200
- 1200 cheesecake and 1500 strudel.
- What?

251
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,300
Yesterday Mindy sold
1200 cheesecake and 1500 strudel.

252
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,000
More strudel than cheesecake.
Are you sure?

253
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,700
- Straight from the baker's mouth.
- What is this?

254
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,600
Statistics. Things a businessman
has to have at his fingertips.

255
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,000
- Any news?
- Not yet. I will leave you know.

256
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,700
I'm gettin' impatient, Detroit.

257
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,200
- And what was that about?
- His wife's havin' a baby.

258
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,700
But why is he asking you?

259
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,400
He's nervous. It's his first wife.

260
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,500
I'm expecting a fellow
on important business.

261
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,400
Suddenly I get a suspicion
you are trying to get rid of me.

262
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,100
No, doll, no.
But this fella does big business.

263
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,100
- Supermarket?
- Super, super.

264
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,500
With him, business is business,
and dolls make him nervous.

265
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,200
Besides, you're late for your rehearsal.
Take Adelaide to the Hot Box. In a cab.

266
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,600
- It's only a few blocks.
- The streets are covered with tourists

267
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,800
and I do not want you molested.

268
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,700
Nathan, darling, you are the most
thoughtful man that ever lived.

269
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,900
- But who's gonna pay for the cab?
- I am, of course.

270
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,900
Sky Masterson.

271
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,500
- Detroit.
- Can I believe my eyes? Is it you?

272
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,100
- How goes your percentage of life?
- Not bad, not bad. And you?

273
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,100
- Healthy at the moment.
- Sit for a minute. Relax. Talk.

274
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,000
Or maybe you're in a hurry.

275
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,600
My daddy always said there's only
one time a man should be in a hurry.

276
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
When the cops are comin' up the stairs.

277
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,800
How about a coffee?
Maybe a piece of cheesecake?

278
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,300
Thanks. I'm pleased to hear
things go well with you, Nathan.

279
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,900
From communiqués
received in Las Vegas,

280
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,200
we understood that Brannigan
was corkin' up the town.

281
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,800
Who worries about Brannigan?

282
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,100
- How was Vegas?
- Paradise for two weeks.

283
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
I gambled in green pastures,
the dice were my cousins

284
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,300
and the dolls were agreeable
with nice teeth and no last names.

285
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,200
You are sure I cannot offer you
cheesecake or strudel?

286
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,400
No, thanks. I just ate.

287
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,300
- How long you gonna be in town?
- Only tonight. Tomorrow I fly to Havana.

288
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,200
Sky, don't think I am a pest,
but do yourself a favour -

289
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,300
eat this last little bite of cheesecake.
You will thank me.

290
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,600
Honestly, I couldn't swallow a mouthful.

291
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
- How is Adelaide?
- Fine.

292
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,800
I suppose one of these days
you'll get married.

293
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,600
- We all gotta go sometime.
- But, Nathan, we can fight it.

294
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,800
The companionship of a doll is pleasant
even for a period running into months.

295
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,100
But for a close relationship
that can last through our life,

296
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,500
no doll can take the place
of aces back to back.

297
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,500
Still, you will admit that Mindy's
cheesecake is the greatest alive.

298
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,100
Gladly. Furthermore,
I am quite partial to Mindy's cheesecake.

299
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,000
And yet, although you might disagree,
many people prefer Mindy's strudel.

300
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,800
Do you disagree?

301
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,700
It is my understanding
that the Constitution

302
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,300
allows everybody the free choice
between cheesecake and strudel.

303
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,900
I would be interested to hear.

304
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,900
Offhand, would you say that Mindy sells
more cheesecake or more strudel?

305
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,100
Going strictly by my personal preference,
I'd say more cheesecake than strudel.

306
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
For how much?

307
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,300
- What?
- For how much?

308
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,800
Why, Nathan! I never knew you
to lay money on the line.

309
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,400
You always take your bite off the top.

310
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,900
1,000 bucks says that yesterday Mindy
sold more strudel than cheesecake.

311
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,500
- Nathan, let me tell you a story.
- Have we got a bet?

312
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:16,300
On the day I left home to make my way in
the world, my daddy took me to one side.

313
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,800
"Son," my daddy says to me,

314
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,100
"I am sorry I am not able
to bankroll you to a large start,

315
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,400
but not having the necessary
lettuce to get you rolling,

316
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,700
instead, I'm going to stake you
to some very valuable advice."

317
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,700
"One of these days, a guy is going to
show you a brand-new deck of cards

318
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,200
on which the seal is not yet broken."

319
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,700
"Then this guy is going to offer to bet you
that he can make the jack of spades

320
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,100
jump out of this brand-new deck
of cards and squirt cider in your ear."

321
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,100
"But, son, you do not accept this bet
because, as sure as you stand there,

322
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,200
you're going to wind up
with an ear full of cider."

323
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,600
Now, Nathan, I do not suggest that you
have been clocking Mindy's cheesecake.

324
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,500
- Would I do such a thing?
- However, if you are looking for action,

325
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,100
I will bet you the same 1,000 that you
cannot name the colour tie you have on.

326
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,900
Have we got a bet?

327
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,900
No bet.

328
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,000
Polka dots. In the whole world,
nobody but Nathan Detroit

329
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,200
could blow 1,000 bucks on polka dots.

330
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,000
- Hi, Sky.
- Nice to see you.

331
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,600
- How goes it?
- Healthy. And with you, Nicely?

332
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,200
Nicely-nicely, thanks. Nathan?

333
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,800
What's the matter, Nathan? You look sick.

334
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,000
The cheesecake backed up on him.

335
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,300
Maybe that's why they told us
they sell more strudel.

336
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,500
Adelaide gave us a message for you.
Be sure and pick her up after the show.

337
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,100
- And don't be late.
- Yes, dear.

338
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,600
- I mean, OK.
- Yes, dear?

339
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,100
This is husband talk if I ever heard it.

340
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,900
You are trapped because Adelaide
is a doll that is most difficult to unload.

341
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
I don't want to unload her. I love her.

342
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,500
A guy without a doll... If a guy does
not have a doll, who would holler on him?

343
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,500
- A doll is a necessity.
- I am not putting the knock on dolls.

344
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,700
But they are something to have only when
they come in handy, like cough drops.

345
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,600
And the proof that I am right is that dolls
are available as far as the eye can see.

346
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,800
Not dolls like Adelaide.

347
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:34,700
Nathan, nothing personal and no offence,
but, weight for age, all dolls are the same.

348
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,800
- All dolls are the same, huh?
- As far as the eye can see.

349
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,400
It seems to me the one place a doll would
come in handy would be in Havana.

350
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,800
So how come you ain't got one? How
come you are going alone, without a doll?

351
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,400
A matter of choice.
I choose to travel alone,

352
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,600
but if I wish to take a doll, the supply
is more than Woolworths has got beads.

353
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,400
- Not high-class dolls.
- There's only one class: interchangeable.

354
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,800
A doll is a doll.
All dolls, any doll. You name her.

355
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,300
Any doll? Will you bet on that? Will you
bet 1,000 bucks that if I name a doll,

356
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,300
you can take the same doll
to Havana with you tomorrow?

357
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,900
You've got yourself a bet.

358
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,700
I name her.

359
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,200
- Her?
- Sergeant Sarah Brown.

360
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,000
Daddy! I got cider in my ear.

361
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,300
It is my fault, you know.

362
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,900
It's not the mission. It's me.

363
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,900
I can't do the job that has to be done.
I'm a failure.

364
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,400
I'd be doing the right thing if I resigned
and went back home to Boston.

365
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,000
Sarah... should you be able
to bend a solid gold watch?

366
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,100
- Of course not.
- That's what I thought.

367
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,800
Why do you want to go home?
There aren't any sinners in Boston?

368
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
What have I accomplished here?

369
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,300
Thousands of depraved characters,

370
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,100
and after months of hard work
an empty mission!

371
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,800
Sarah, I'm ashamed of you.
Just because the riffraff of Broadway

372
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,100
didn't break down that door when they
heard you were in charge of this mission.

373
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,100
These aren't small-town delinquents
who drink too much on Saturday night.

374
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,000
You're up against the devil's first-string
troops, a whole army of devil's disciples.

375
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,200
- Do you take sinners here?
- At any time of the day or night, son.

376
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,400
Come right in and sit down.

377
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,100
- Cup of coffee and a doughnut?
- Just coffee, thanks.

378
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,200
I am not here because I am poor
and hungry... not for food, that is.

379
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,100
"Blessed are they which do hunger
after righteousness." Is that it?

380
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,500
Hunger and thirst after righteousness.
Yes, sir. That's it.

381
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,300
My name's Arvide Abernathy. The young
lady at the desk is Sergeant Sarah Brown.

382
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,000
To you, we're Brother Arvide
and Sister Sarah. Sit down, son.

383
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,900
- How do you do?
- Brother Sky. Hello, Sister Sarah.

384
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,100
- Is that your name? Sky?
- Sky Masterson.

385
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,600
What is it that troubles you,
Mr Masterson?

386
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,900
- Brother Sky.
- I gather you are not in need of money.

387
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,900
I'm healthy at the moment. It can change.
Are only the unhappy poor welcome?

388
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,200
What are you unhappy about, son?

389
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,700
Gambling.

390
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,700
Apparently you're a successful gambler.

391
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,600
Is it wrong to gamble, or only to lose?

392
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,300
- I'll come back for help when I'm broke.
- Don't misunderstand.

393
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,100
It's just so unusual for a successful
sinner to be unhappy about sin.

394
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,000
Besides, my unhappiness came up
very suddenly. Maybe it'll go away again.

395
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,800
We can keep you unhappy, son.
Give us a chance.

396
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,100
You don't look like a gambler at heart.
What made you take it up?

397
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,100
Evil companions. Evil companions
who are always offering me sucker bets.

398
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,700
- Just what is a sucker bet?
- A bet that is reserved for suckers.

399
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,400
For a gambler to get sucked in
on such a bet is most humiliating.

400
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,800
But to lose it means that you are marked
for a very long time as a chump.

401
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,800
You must go all out to win it.

402
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,300
Is that so terrible,
to be marked as a chump?

403
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,800
Among my people, being a chump
is like losing your citizenship.

404
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,500
A chump is an outsider, a yokel
who will buy anything with varnish on it.

405
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,000
Like a solid gold watch for a dollar?

406
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,200
This is a real chump.

407
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,500
Well, I think I'll get some rest
before we go out again.

408
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,900
Brother Sky, I'm glad you found us.
You stay here and talk to Sister Sarah.

409
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,800
Whatever your problems are,
she'll have the answers.

410
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,000
- I hope so.
- I know so.

411
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,400
If there's one thing
Sister Sarah never fails in,

412
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,600
it's solving other people's problems.

413
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,300
What did he mean by that?

414
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,800
The way he said you never fail
in solving other people's problems.

415
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,100
Haven't we changed places,
Mr Masterson?

416
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
- Brother Sky.
- Aren't we supposed...

417
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,400
Why do you have trouble
calling me Brother Sky?

418
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,000
We're supposed to be
discussing your problems.

419
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,700
Maybe non-sinners also have problems.

420
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,800
If you are sincerely interested in
giving up gambling, Mr... Brother Sky,

421
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,600
reading these pamphlets will help you.

422
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,500
My daddy said reading pamphlets
never made anybody give up anything.

423
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,300
Now, I had a more personal help in mind.

424
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,800
There's a midnight prayer meeting
on Thursday.

425
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,100
The day after tomorrow.
Who's going to help me until then?

426
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,700
Well, our doors are always open.
Come in any time.

427
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,300
You know what I think, Sister Sarah?

428
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,900
I think you not only don't wanna help me,
but you're against me.

429
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm afraid that is true.
I'm afraid I don't trust you, Mr Masterson.

430
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,800
- Brother Sky.
- Mr Masterson.

431
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,500
You don't believe I'm a sinner.

432
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,500
I'm prepared to believe you're the biggest
sinner I've ever met in my life.

433
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,500
But you don't believe I want to repent.

434
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,900
Is that it?

435
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,100
All of a sudden you want a cup of coffee.

436
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,100
Did it ever occur to you that some people
could be all repentance and no sin?

437
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,400
You know, I may start
a chain of missions to help your kind.

438
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,400
"Come all ye repenters and let us
bring a little sin into your life."

439
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,700
"There is no peace unto the wicked.
Proverbs." This is wrong.

440
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,800
Let's say it's a matter of opinion,
shall we?

441
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,400
I made a statement of fact. It's wrong.

442
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,300
How dare you! Even if this is not
a church, it is a mission.

443
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,600
- How dare you blaspheme.
- How dare you misquote the Bible.

444
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,600
This is not Proverbs.

445
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,200
- Of course it's Proverbs.
- Isaiah.

446
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,100
Chapter 57, verse 20 or 21.

447
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Would you like to bet on it?
Not money, just a nice sociable bet?

448
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,500
Isaiah?

449
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Only one thing has been in as many
hotel rooms as I have - the Gideon Bible.

450
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,800
Never tangle with me on the Good Book.
I must have read it a dozen times.

451
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,800
- If all that was no help to you...
- Who says it wasn't?

452
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,300
In one of my blackest moments
I came up with a three-horse parlay.

453
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,800
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

454
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,000
- Mr Masterson, why did you come here?
- I told you, I'm an unhappy sinner.

455
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,700
- Excuse me, but you're a liar.
- Lying is not one of my sins.

456
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,500
I am not in the market
for a one-dollar solid gold watch.

457
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,500
All right. We'll lay it on the line.

458
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,800
- We'll deal the hand open.
- Could you say that in English?

459
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,300
I'm sure you've earned your stripes
in combat against the devil.

460
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,100
- There's no need to be sarcastic.
- But not on this battlefield

461
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,900
against the devil's first-line troops.

462
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,100
You can't get at the enemy.
This mission is laying an egg.

463
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,100
- You have no way of knowing.
- I've got lots of ways.

464
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,400
You are stuck with a store
full of repentance and no customers.

465
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,400
Without sinners to repent,
repentance doesn't exist.

466
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,500
So you're stuck with a store full
of nothing. Do I give you a fair rundown?

467
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,700
I wouldn't know.
I've never had a rundown.

468
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,900
- Would you be open to a proposition?
- I've had those. No.

469
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,700
Don't flatter yourself. I'm talking business.

470
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,500
I am in a position to supply
the raw material you need for your work.

471
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,700
- Namely sinners.
- How?

472
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,800
That's my work. Now when is this
big midnight meeting of yours?

473
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,500
Thursday. I guarantee to supply that
meeting with one dozen genuine sinners.

474
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,500
- Whether they repent or not is up to you.
- Thank you. That's a fair rundown.

475
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,000
Now, if you will excuse me...

476
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Just a minute, Sister Sarah.

477
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,100
This is not a charity contribution.
This is a business transaction.

478
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,400
Something you want for something I want.

479
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,900
And what is that?

480
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,100
Have dinner with me tomorrow night.

481
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,600
Why should that be something you want?

482
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Well, maybe because I think
I'll be hungry tomorrow night.

483
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,000
- Keep this. It's my marker.
- Your what?

484
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,600
My marker. My IOU for one dozen
genuine sinners delivered as described.

485
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,300
- I will pick you up tomorrow at noon.
- At noon to go to dinner?

486
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,400
It takes time to get there. We're going to
my favourite restaurant - El Café Cabana.

487
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,200
Where's that?

488
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,800
- Havana.
- Havana, Cuba?

489
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,600
- Well, what other Havanas are there?
- You wanna take me to dinner in Cuba?

490
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,800
- Well, they eat in Cuba, same as we do.
- What do you take me for? A chump?

491
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,000
- Isaiah's on the other side.
- Get out.

492
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,200
What are they worth to ya? One dozen
genuine sinners ready for salvation.

493
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,900
What are they worth to you?
A chicken salad in the tearoom?

494
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,100
One last word, Sergeant.
I don't want you to walk out of this room

495
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,300
thinking you're upset because some
black-hearted sinner made advances...

496
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,700
- It's none of your business what I think.
- ..to a virtuous lady with a white soul.

497
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,300
Any sinful thoughts present in this room
at this time come out of you, doll, not me.

498
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,700
You're quite right. I'm nothing
but a repressed, neurotic girl -

499
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,500
I've read books on the subject -
who is abnormally attracted to sin,

500
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,800
and so abnormally afraid of it. You're
not the first man to try that approach.

501
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,100
I am happy to know that I am not the first
man who tried to approach in any way.

502
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,200
- You're not even close.
- I imagine you've succeeded

503
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,400
in blocking all possible approaches.

504
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,600
Except for a few that
you wouldn't know about, I'm afraid.

505
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,600
Well, of course, I only know
the ones on the outskirts of society.

506
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,300
What are the approaches like
on the inskirts?

507
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,400
All paved with honourable intentions?

508
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,200
- I wonder what he'll be like.
- Who?

509
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,300
That upright, downright, forthright square
with his close-shaved chin up,

510
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,200
who right now, somewhere, is marching
along the proper approach to proper you.

511
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:31,000
- What'll he be like?
- He will not be a gambler, for one thing.

512
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,600
I can name better than you the things
he won't be, but what will he be?

513
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,000
- How will you know when he gets to you?
- Don't worry. I'll know.

514
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,700
For I've imagined every bit of him

515
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,800
From his strong moral fibre

516
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,600
To the wisdom in his head

517
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:55,200
To the homey aroma of his pipe

518
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,700
You have wished yourself
a small-town Galahad

519
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,100
The breakfast-eating four-button type

520
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:08,500
And I shall meet him
when the time is ripe

521
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,700
I'll know

522
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,300
When my love comes along

523
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,500
I won't take a chance

524
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,900
For, oh

525
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,700
He'll be just what I need

526
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,100
Not some fly-by-night
Broadway romance

527
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,300
And you'll know at a glance
by the two pair of pants

528
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,100
I'll know

529
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,400
By his calm, steady voice

530
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,900
Those feet on the ground

531
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,100
I'll know

532
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,400
As I run to his arms

533
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,200
That at last I've come home

534
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,100
Safe and sound

535
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,700
And till then I shall wait

536
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,600
And till then I'll be strong

537
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,800
For I'll know

538
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,100
When my love

539
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,500
Comes along

540
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,200
Mine will come as a surprise to me

541
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,000
Mine I leave to chance and chemistry

542
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,200
- Chemistry?
- Yeah, chemistry.

543
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,500
Suddenly I'll know

544
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,900
When my love comes along

545
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,100
I'll know then and there

546
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,100
I'll know

547
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,700
At the sight of her face

548
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:10,300
How I care, how I care, how I care

549
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,700
And I'll stop

550
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,500
And I'll stare

551
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,600
And I'll know

552
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,300
Long before we can speak

553
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,000
I'll know

554
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,900
In my heart

555
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
I'll know

556
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,000
And I won't ever ask

557
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,300
Am I right? Am I wise? Am I smart?

558
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,200
But I'll stop

559
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,400
And I'll stare

560
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,500
At that face

561
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,800
In the throng

562
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,400
Yes, I'll know

563
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,300
When my love

564
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,600
Comes along

565
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,500
Well, that makes it necessary
for me to drop back again.

566
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,200
Matthew 5:39.

567
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,500
Don't bother looking it up.
It's the bit about the other cheek.

568
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,300
I know, Joey.
But the 1,000 bucks is guaranteed.

569
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,400
What? It's a bet I cannot lose.

570
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,600
I bet Sky Masterson he could not take
a certain doll to Havana with him.

571
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,400
Not this doll.

572
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,900
Now for the grand finale
of our round-the-world revue,

573
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,100
the Hot Box takes you out to the alley
with Miss Adelaide and her Alley Kittens.

574
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,000
One meow, two meow,
three meow, scat!

575
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,100
What's the initial of my pet tomcat?

576
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,600
Is it A, B, C, D, E, F, G?

577
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,900
Is it H or J or L, M, N, O, P?

578
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,500
Is it L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T?

579
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,600
No, it's you! You're the cat for me!

580
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,300
You know you've been mean to me

581
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,400
And you know when you're mean to me

582
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,600
How it always makes me wanna roam

583
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,700
And you know there's a danger

584
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,600
That some gentle stranger

585
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:34,200
Might pick me up
and make me feel at home

586
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,700
So pet me, Poppa

587
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,500
Poppa, pet me nice

588
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,900
Ooh, pet me, Poppa

589
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,500
-  Poppa, melt the ice
-  And you know how

590
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,400
If you don't want me out roamin' the city

591
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,700
Talk to me pretty - here, kitty kitty!

592
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,200
And pet me, Poppa

593
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,100
Poppa, pet me nice

594
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,300
Ooh, pet me, Poppa

595
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,000
Poppa, pet me good

596
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,500
Mm, pet me, Poppa

597
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,900
-  Proper, like you should
-  And you know how

598
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,700
If you care to keep me home by the fire

599
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,100
Specially when it's time to retire

600
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,800
Then pet me, Poppa

601
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,000
Poppa, pet me good

602
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,100
Warm up my saucer of milk

603
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,600
And maybe I'll purr

604
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,000
Lay out my cushion of silk

605
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,600
Don't rumple my fur

606
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,300
-  Just reach over and...
-  Pet me, Poppa

607
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,900
Poppa, melt the ice

608
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,600
If you don't want me out roamin' the city

609
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,900
Talk to me pretty - here, kitty kitty!

610
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,400
And pet me, Poppa

611
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,200
That's my good advice

612
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,100
Pet me, Poppa

613
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,200
Pet me, Poppa

614
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,600
Pet me, Poppa

615
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,800
Poppa, pet me

616
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,900
That'll get me!  Pet me, Poppa

617
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:59,300
Poppa, pet me nice

618
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:08,200
I gotta hang up. Can I tell the guys that
the game'll be at your garage tomorrow?

619
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,500
I would gladly pay you in advance, but
I will not get the money until tomorrow.

620
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,200
I've got to have time
to spread the word around.

621
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,900
Joey, listen to...

622
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,600
Yes, Joey.

623
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,100
Drop dead, Joey.

624
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,300
Oh, Nathan, darling!

625
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,400
You got here early.

626
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,100
It's so thrilling to find you waiting for me.

627
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,100
Just like we were married
and I was coming home from work.

628
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,200
You wouldn't make me stop working,
would you, Nathan?

629
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,500
That would be cruel. A doll like you could
earn good money for another ten years.

630
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,700
- Easy.
- Sweet!

631
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,900
And you were reading my book, too.

632
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,500
See? I told you reading
don't make people go blind.

633
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,300
It's very interesting, isn't it?

634
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,800
What is? Oh, the book. Yeah.

635
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,100
The doctor gave it to me. He said
it might help me get rid of my cold.

636
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,000
- With a book?
- He thinks that my cold might possibly

637
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,600
be caused by psychology.

638
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,900
How does he know you got psychology?

639
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,100
Nathan! Everybody has got it.

640
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:29,300
And female psychology explains why
certain girls do certain kinds of things.

641
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,300
It's all in the book.

642
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,500
Must be some book.

643
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,700
Would it, for instance,
tell you what kind of a doll

644
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,100
would go for a certain kind of a guy
which you wouldn't think she would?

645
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,300
Nathan! No matter
how terrible a fella seems,

646
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,700
you can never be sure
that some girl won't go for him.

647
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,900
Take us.

648
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,500
Get dressed. We'll go eat.

649
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,900
Starting with next week, Nathan,
I will be getting a raise in salary.

650
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,300
Where does it say what different dolls do?

651
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,700
You're not even listening to me.

652
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,000
Gesundheit.

653
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,700
I will be making enough
so that we can finally get married.

654
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,800
What do you think?

655
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,500
Of course we'll get married.
Sooner or later.

656
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,300
Nathan, after 14 years
it is already too late to be sooner.

657
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,700
And if it gets much later,
soon it will be too late even to be later.

658
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,800
Gesundheit.

659
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,000
Besides, Nathan, I don't know
what to do any more about Mother.

660
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:43,200
- Mother? What about your mother?
- This is something I haven't told you,

661
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,200
but my mother, back in Rhode Island,

662
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,000
she thinks that...
that we are already married.

663
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,300
How could she think such a thing?

664
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,200
Maybe because I wrote her
that we were already married.

665
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,100
- That would make her think so.
- In Rhode Island

666
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,500
people do not remain engaged
for 14 years.

667
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,300
- They get married.
- So how come it's such a small state?

668
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,700
Furthermore, after about two years...
after about two years we...

669
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,400
We got a divorce?

670
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,000
- We had a baby.
- You wrote your mother we had a baby?

671
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,200
I had to, Nathan.
Mother kept after me and after me

672
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,600
and finally I just ran out of excuses.

673
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,400
And what type baby was it?

674
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,200
It was a boy. I named it after you, Nathan.

675
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

676
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,400
Tell me, what has Nathan Junior
been doing all these years?

677
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,900
Well... right now he's in boarding school.

678
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,600
As a matter of fact, I wrote Mother that
he won the football game last Saturday.

679
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,100
I wish I had a bet on it.

680
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,200
But, Nathan...

681
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,700
That isn't all.

682
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,800
You're not going to say
we also have an Adelaide Junior?

683
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,400
All these years, Nathan.
Mother believes in big families, and...

684
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,200
And we had such an early start.

685
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,800
Just give me the grand total.

686
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,200
- Five.
- Adelaide!

687
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,900
How could you do such a thing
to a nice old broad like your mother?

688
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,700
Nathan, darling, let's just us get married

689
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,000
and I'll handle everything else. OK?

690
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,300
OK, doll. When we're ready.

691
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,900
Nathan, we are ready now.
We have been ready for 14 years.

692
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,700
All we need now is a licence
and a blood test.

693
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,000
- Blood test?
- Don't worry, Nathan. You've got blood.

694
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:50,100
What a city! First they close my crap
game and then they open my veins.

695
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,900
Nathan, you gave up the crap game.

696
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,900
Of course I did, doll. And you know why?
For you. Because I love you.

697
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,500
Can I borrow some earrings?

698
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,500
It is customary, Laverne, to knock

699
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,900
when entering the private
dressing room of an engaged person.

700
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,400
As far as I'm concerned,
you are in here by yourself.

701
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,400
- May I borrow some earrings?
- Diamonds or pearls?

702
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,800
- Diamonds.
- Top drawer of the trunk. The big box.

703
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,700
Aren't they a little long, dear?
Remember, you've got a short neck.

704
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,700
He's a tall man.

705
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,700
You! I'm all dated up
with Society Max tomorrow night,

706
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,500
and he breaks it
on account of your silly crap game.

707
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,600
Adelaide, look at me. I'm on my knees.

708
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,300
Oh, get up.
It reminds me of your crap game.

709
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,300
Adelaide, doll!

710
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,200
You're getting yourself
upset about nothin'.

711
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,900
It's a game I set up a long time ago.
I couldn't get out of it.

712
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Understand?

713
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,000
Look, we love each other.
We're gonna get married.

714
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,100
We'll be happy.

715
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,900
Get out of my life, Nathan Detroit.

716
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,300
I knew you'd understand.

717
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,600
Gesundheit.

718
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,300
It says here:

719
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,500
The average unmarried female

720
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,500
Basically insecure

721
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,600
Due to some long frustration

722
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,700
May react

723
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,100
With psychosomatic symptoms

724
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,600
Difficult to endure

725
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:32,300
Affecting the upper respiratory tract

726
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,700
In other words, just from waiting around
for that plain little band of gold

727
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,700
A person can develop a cold

728
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,500
You can spray her wherever
you figure the streptococci lurk

729
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:56,500
You can give her a shot for whatever
she's got but it just won't work

730
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,700
If she's tired of getting
that fisheye from the hotel clerk

731
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,200
A person can develop a cold

732
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,400
It says here:

733
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,500
The female remaining single

734
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,800
Constantly in suspense

735
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,400
Shows a neurotic tendency

736
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,900
See note

737
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,500
See note? Note?

738
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,400
Chronic organic syndromes

739
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,900
Toxic or hypertense

740
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,600
Involving the eye, the ear,
the nose and throat

741
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,900
In other words, just from wondering
whether the wedding is on or off

742
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,800
A person can develop a cough

743
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,200
You can feed her all day
with the vitamin A and the bromo fizz

744
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:01,100
But the medicine never gets
anywhere near where the trouble is

745
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,200
If she's getting a kind of a name
for herself and the name ain't his

746
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,200
A person can develop a cough

747
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,900
And furthermore, just from stalling
and stalling and stalling the wedding trip

748
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,800
A person can develop la grippe

749
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,700
When they get on the train for Niagara

750
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,700
And she can hear church bells chime

751
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,300
The compartment is air-conditioned

752
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:38,500
And the mood sublime

753
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,700
Then they get off at Yonkers racetrack

754
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,200
For the 14th time

755
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,900
A person can develop la grippe

756
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,600
La grippe, la post-nasal drip

757
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,000
With the wheezes and the sneezes

758
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,300
And a sinus that's really a pip

759
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:09,000
From a lack of community property
and a feeling she's getting too old

760
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:19,000
A person can develop a bad, bad cold

761
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,100
Follow the fold and stray no more

762
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,400
Stray no more, stray no more

763
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,700
Put down the bottle
and we'll say no more

764
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,300
One minute earlier
you would have witnessed

765
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,700
Miss Sarah give
Sky Masterson a 100% brushoff.

766
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,600
So the 1,000 for Joey
is practically in your pocket.

767
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,900
- You should be jumping for joy.
- I'm jumpin'.

768
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,600
You got work to do.
Arrangements to make.

769
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:32,700
- A shave and a hot towel'll fix you up.
- For who should I have a shave?

770
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,200
- For who should I have a hot towel?
- Do you know what is at stake here?

771
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,700
Nathan Detroit's crap game.
Because of a doll.

772
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,700
I cannot believe a number one
businessman like you

773
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,600
could let himself
fall in love with his own fiancée.

774
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:51,200
So Adelaide is my weakness! Can you not
be tolerant that I have got a weakness?

775
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:57,300
Especially since this is a sad condition
that guys are in all over the world? Look.

776
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,800
What's playin' at the Roxy?
I'll tell you what's playin' at the Roxy

777
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,400
It's a picture about a Minnesota man
so in love with a Mississippi girl

778
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,800
That he sacrifices everything
and moves all the way to Biloxi

779
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,400
That's what's playin' at the Roxy

780
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,100
<i>What's in the Daily News?
I'll tell you what's in the Daily News</i>

781
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,200
Story about a guy
who bought his wife a small ruby

782
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,400
With what otherwise
would have been his union dues

783
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,200
<i>That's what's in the Daily News</i>

784
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:27,300
What's happenin' all over?
I'll tell you what's happenin' all over

785
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,700
Guys sitting home by a television set
who used to be something of a rover

786
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,700
That's what's happening all over

787
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,100
Love is the thing that has licked them

788
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,400
And it looks like I'm just another victim

789
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,600
Yes, sir.

790
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,800
When you see a guy
reach for stars in the sky

791
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,300
You can bet
that he's doin' it for some doll

792
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,700
When you spot a John
waitin' out in the rain

793
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:01,100
Chances are he's insane
as only a John can be for a Jane

794
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,500
When you meet a gent
payin' all kinds of rent

795
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,000
For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal

796
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,500
Call it sad, call it funny

797
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:18,200
But it's better than even money
that the guy's only doin' it for some doll

798
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:38,500
When you see a Joe
savin' half of his dough

799
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,900
You can bet there'll be
mink in it for some doll

800
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,300
When a bum buys wine
like a bum can't afford

801
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,600
It's a cinch that the bum
is under the thumb of some little broad

802
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:56,000
When you meet a mug
lately out of the jug

803
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:00,500
And he's still liftin' platinum folderol

804
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,800
Call it hell, call it heaven

805
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:09,200
It's a probable twelve to seven
that the guy's only doin' it for some doll

806
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:31,500
When you see a sport
and his cash has run short

807
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,900
You can bet
he's been blowin' it on some doll

808
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,300
When a guy wears tails
with the front gleaming white

809
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,800
Who the heck do you think
he's ticklin' pink on Saturday night?

810
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,200
When some lazy slob
gets a good steady job

811
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:53,200
And he smells from Vitalis and Barbasol

812
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,200
Call it dumb, call it clever

813
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:01,500
Ah, but you can give odds for ever
that the guy's only doin' it for some doll

814
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,100
Some doll, some doll

815
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:09,100
The guy's only doin' it for some doll

816
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,700
Well, I think we finally managed
to shake off the prince of darkness.

817
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,100
You certainly discouraged him.

818
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,300
I certainly did.

819
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,900
Arvide.

820
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,800
General Cartwright,
what a pleasant surprise.

821
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,300
- We didn't know you were in town.
- A flying visit.

822
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,300
Flew in from Boston early this morning.
Important luncheon meeting.

823
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:39,300
While waiting, thought I'd check
a few of our outposts informally.

824
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:44,200
I'm surprised the mission was unattended
in a neighbourhood as unsavoury as this.

825
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,200
Why should you be surprised?
You've seen our records.

826
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,800
We don't seem to get anyone in here
even to rob the place.

827
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,000
Yes.

828
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,100
Well, now that you've brought it up,

829
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:00,300
I must confess I have come for
a purpose - an unhappy one, I'm afraid.

830
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,500
It doesn't look as if
we accomplish anything, but in time...

831
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,400
Time, I'm afraid,
is what we can no longer afford.

832
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,800
My good friends,
after careful deliberation,

833
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,400
headquarters has decided
to close this branch of the mission.

834
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,000
- Close the mission?
- No, General. Please!

835
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,200
Even if I haven't made a success of it,
someone will.

836
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,300
Sarah Brown, if you can't
attract sinners, nobody can.

837
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,600
There are so many calls on us. So many
other places where our work is needed.

838
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,000
How do you do?

839
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,800
- I don't believe we've met, Brother...?
- Brother Sky Masterson. Former sinner.

840
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,900
I am General Cartwright,
regional director of Save-A-Soul.

841
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
- Why isn't his name on the report?
- What were you doing in there?

842
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,900
I was resting, Sister Sarah.
I was going to ask Brother Arvide

843
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,400
if he might let me carry the drum
when we go out again this afternoon.

844
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,500
On behalf of former sinners of the future,
I protest the closing of this mission.

845
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:04,700
- General, I think I should explain to you...
- Sarah, this man has a right to be heard.

846
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,800
Continue, Brother Sky.

847
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,200
General, would you be open
to a proposition?

848
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,900
The general is flying back to Boston. She
will not be available for dinner tonight.

849
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,900
Sarah, what are you talking about?

850
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,700
- What have you got in mind, young man?
- Faith in Sister Sarah.

851
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:30,500
I ask you to give her 36 hours to show
that she can make this mission pay off.

852
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,500
Saving souls should not be
referred to as paying off.

853
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,200
- Why 36 hours?
- Because he knows our big meeting,

854
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,100
36 hours from now,
will be a great success.

855
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,700
Uncle Arvide!

856
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,000
But how can you guarantee that,
Brother Sky?

857
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,700
Well, let's just say
I have a feeling about it.

858
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,200
"If sinners entice thee, consent thou not."
That's the wrong thought.

859
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,000
Where is yesterday's thought for today?

860
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,600
Top right-hand drawer.

861
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,900
Excuse me, General.

862
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,700
Before going to the expense
of a meeting, you'd require more

863
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,600
than just a feeling
that it will be successful.

864
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,300
It's a very strong feeling, General.

865
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,700
"There is no peace to the wicked."
Isaiah 57:21. That is correct.

866
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,400
General, my proposition is this.

867
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,900
Why don't you come to the midnight
meeting and find out for yourself?

868
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,900
Well, if I thought there was a chance
of finding definite progress,

869
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,100
any sizeable turnout...

870
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,400
What do you think, Sister Sarah?

871
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:52,100
Don't you honestly believe this mission
could be saved within the next 36 hours?

872
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:04,100
General Cartwright, I am in a position
to guarantee you personally

873
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,300
at least one dozen genuine sinners.

874
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,900
Hallelujah!

875
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,700
Be sure you're wearing your carnation.

876
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,500
Remember, nobody gets in the crap game
without they got a red carnation.

877
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,900
- It's like a password. Nathan's orders.
- We got the flowers. Where is the action?

878
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,100
The minute Nathan arrives we're gonna...

879
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:41,300
He has arrived. Is it all set? Can I tell
the customers it's Joey Biltmore's...

880
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:46,100
Not till I put the 1,000 in Joey's hand.
And I haven't got it yet.

881
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:51,000
I sent Nicely to wait for Sky. When he gets
the money, Nicely'll bring it back to me.

882
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,900
They won't stick around.
They're getting nervous.

883
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,000
I'm not nervous?

884
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,400
Harry the Horse.
How is everything in Brooklyn?

885
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,500
I hope, Detroit,
that you will not spoil our evenin'.

886
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,000
I happen to be entertainin'
a very prominent guest tonight.

887
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,100
I would like you to meet
Big Jule from Chicago.

888
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,300
I would like you to meet
Big Jule from Chicago.

889
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,500
Big Jule, welcome to our fair city.
In which, as you know, the heat is on.

890
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:25,000
However, if you will be patient,
you will be provided with action.

891
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,100
What do you say?
Shall we stick around or blow?

892
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,900
I come here to shoot crap.
Let's shoot crap.

893
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:40,200
- Order another milkshake and relax.
- Nathan!

894
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:46,900
Do not let the fact that Big Jule
drinks milk give you any wrong ideas.

895
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:51,700
- Big Jule does not like to be displeased.
- Why, Harry, did I give the impression

896
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:57,300
I was being rude to a guest with such
a well-deserved reputation as Big Jule?

897
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:02,800
Big Jule, I am sure that you did not
misunderstand my kidding remarks.

898
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:08,700
It's just that one look at your kindly face,
which is so full of fun, good fellowship...

899
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,700
Could I have a swallow of your milk?

900
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,500
Well, well, well...

901
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,400
What have we here?

902
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,200
The jails must be empty tonight.

903
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,100
Can anybody be missing?

904
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,800
Harry the Horse, Liver Lips Louie,

905
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,000
Angie the Ox, Society Max...

906
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,400
And here is a face
for which I cannot supply a name.

907
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,600
May I ask where you come from?

908
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,700
East Cicero, Illinois.

909
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,200
And what is your occupation there?

910
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,600
I'm a scoutmaster.

911
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,500
Don't ever help my mother
across the street.

912
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:02,000
Such lovely red carnations.

913
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:09,600
Is it a funeral? Did somebody die
suddenly that I don't know about yet?

914
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,400
What's on, Nathan? What brings
all these senior delinquents together?

915
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,700
- They got Ionely. How do I know?
- Why are they all wearing carnations?

916
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,700
- They are also all wearing pants.
- You are up to no good, Detroit!

917
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,400
Is it a crime to wear flowers? Is Mindy's
suddenly a hideout for gangsters?

918
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:42,500
Lieutenant, I'll confess. We're smuggling
hot cheesecake into Canada.

919
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,500
This is all I need. It's complete.

920
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:55,800
Everybody in the whole world
who hates me is now here.

921
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,600
What's the use, Nathan?
Why try to keep it a secret?

922
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,400
- Bite your tongue, Benny.
- All right, what's this all about?

923
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,300
- It's... a party, Lieutenant.
- What kind of a party?

924
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,500
A dinner.
A bachelor dinner for Nathan Detroit.

925
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,500
He's gettin' married.

926
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,500
For he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow

927
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,400
For he's a jolly good fellow

928
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,800
Which nobody cannot deny

929
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:37,500
Nathan, darling. I'm so thrilled.

930
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,500
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It was gonna be a surprise wedding.

931
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,800
You certainly had me fooled, Detroit.
When is the happy occasion?

932
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,800
Well, it's gonna take a little time -
to get the blood test and the licence.

933
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,600
Wouldn't it be wonderful
to get married tomorrow?

934
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,400
After the opening
of the new show at the Hot Box.

935
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:01,200
Adelaide, according to the laws under
which we live, it's gonna take a little time.

936
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,300
You could elope.

937
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,500
- You are telling me to violate the law?
- It's legal to elope at your age.

938
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,500
And the great state of Maryland will
marry you right away - no blood test.

939
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,400
Ain't that unhealthy?

940
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,600
The lieutenant has come up with
a romantic suggestion of which I approve.

941
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:22,100
Elope, and for the trip
I will loan you my getaway car.

942
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,500
That is, my station wagon.

943
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,100
Oh, Nathan, darling. Let's do it.

944
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,300
Please?

945
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,300
OK. Deal me in.

946
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,200
Speech, Nathan.

947
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,700
Yeah, give us a little speech.

948
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,600
Unaccustomed as I am
to getting married

949
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:02,700
I am taking this occasion here to say

950
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,000
That me and Adelaide

951
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:16,500
Are finally naming the day

952
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,900
Though she knows deep in her heart

953
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,500
I'm a phoney and I'm a fake

954
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,100
She wants five children to start

955
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,100
Five's a difficult point to make

956
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:34,300
But...

957
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,100
Adelaide, Adelaide

958
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,700
Ever-Iovin' Adelaide

959
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,500
Is takin' a chance on me

960
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,900
Takin' a chance
I'll be respectable and nice

961
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,100
Give up cards and dice

962
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,100
And go for shoes and rice

963
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,400
So gentlemen, deal me out

964
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,900
Do not try to feel me out

965
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,000
I got no more evenings free

966
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,400
Since Adelaide, Adelaide

967
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,300
Ever-Iovin' Adelaide

968
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,700
Is takin' a chance

969
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,800
Talk about your long shots

970
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,800
Takin' a chance on me

971
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,900
Well, my congratulations, too.

972
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,700
And I certainly hope
there's nothing in heredity.

973
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,600
It might seem unimportant to you,
but your blintzes are gettin' cold.

974
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:43,100
Who cares? As long as Nathan stays hot.

975
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,400
Look, don't forget to bring
my purse to the Hot Box.

976
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,700
Nathan, darling, I'm so excited. I don't
even wanna eat and go back to work.

977
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:55,300
I've got so many things to do
before tomorrow night.

978
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:02,100
What about my mother?
I've gotta write to her. What'll I say?

979
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,100
Send a telegram. Date it back 14 years.

980
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,000
Adelaide

981
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,800
Adelaide

982
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,400
Ever-Iovin' Adelaide

983
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,000
Is takin' a chance on me

984
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,400
Takin' a chance
I'll be respectable and nice

985
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,200
Give up the cards and dice

986
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,700
And go for shoes and rice

987
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,400
So gentlemen, deal me out

988
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,700
Do not try to feel me out

989
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,900
You got no more evenings free

990
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,500
You may scratch me.

991
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,000
-  Since Adelaide
-  Adelaide

992
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,300
Ever-Iovin' Adelaide

993
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,800
Is takin' a chance

994
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,400
Talk about your long shots

995
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,200
Takin' a chance

996
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:59,900
On me

997
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:07,600
Nathan, you are indeed a most lucky fella.
She is a most beautiful doll indeed.

998
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:11,100
- Do you agree, Big Jule?
- Tell me, how long do you know the doll?

999
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,800
- 14 years.
- Let's shoot crap.

1000
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:21,000
- Nathan!
- Got the money? You couldn't find Sky?

1001
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,500
- Did you go to the mission?
- That's what I'm trying to tell ya.

1002
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,200
- He must be with the mission band now.
- Nathan, wait!

1003
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:18,500
"This church is for the most part Spanish
baroque built of native limestone."

1004
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:23,100
"The original church
was built on this site in 1674

1005
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:27,900
and reconstructed
between 1704 and 1724."

1006
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,500
- It's almost impossible to believe.
- Well, that's not very old for a church.

1007
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,300
Long before 1674
there were missionaries...

1008
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,600
What does it say about the moonlight?

1009
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,000
The moonlight?

1010
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,200
- It's very bright, isn't it?
- You can even read your guidebook by it.

1011
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,500
Now that you mention it...

1012
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,100
- What does it say about the music?
- The music?

1013
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,900
It's a lovely tune.

1014
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,400
Sister Sarah, let me read out of
Sky Masterson's guidebook about you.

1015
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,300
You could be locked away in a room
with no sun, no moon,

1016
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:11,900
no laughter, no music, no love,
and you wouldn't care.

1017
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,500
You could still be a missionary.

1018
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:23,100
"The cobblestones in this plaza
are approximately four centuries old."

1019
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:28,900
"They are the very cobblestones put
down by the Spanish colonists in 1519."

1020
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,800
- What's your pleasure?
- Drinking.

1021
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,300
What's your pleasure?

1022
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,600
Milk, please.

1023
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,800
- Don't make a spectacle of yourself.
- Milk.

1024
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,800
You are a US citizen in a foreign country.

1025
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,400
Have you no pride
in what the world thinks about us?

1026
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,600
Milk!

1027
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,100
What did you order?

1028
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:17,800
<i>Dulce de leche.
Dulce is the Spanish word for "sweet".</i>

1029
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,500
<i>- De means "of' and leche means "milk".
- Sweet of milk.</i>

1030
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,600
Don't they serve it plain?

1031
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,500
Well, only in the mornings.
It has to do with the heat.

1032
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,400
At night they put
a kind of preservative in it.

1033
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,200
That's interesting. What do they use?

1034
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,900
Bacardi.

1035
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,700
Doesn't that have alcohol in it?

1036
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:43,500
Well, just enough to keep
the milk from turning sour.

1037
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:52,700
That's the same song we heard
being played near the church, isn't it?

1038
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,000
Playing the tambourine
has developed in you an ear for music.

1039
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:02,600
Mr Masterson, you think
I'm an awful prude, don't you?

1040
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,300
Are you?

1041
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,700
Well, I wonder sometimes.

1042
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,300
For instance,
supposing I wasn't in mission work.

1043
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,200
This is a tasty milkshake.

1044
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:25,200
Do you mind if I have another?

1045
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,600
Supposing I was just any girl.

1046
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,400
Do you think just any girl
would be a prude

1047
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:40,900
if she refused to go to Havana
with a man she'd never met before?

1048
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,400
Oh, I suppose not.

1049
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,100
Would you like some of mine
while you're waiting?

1050
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,100
I haven't touched it.

1051
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,300
Just a sip.

1052
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:56,000
Oh, thanks.

1053
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,800
I don't know when I've been so thirsty.

1054
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,700
Still, you do think I'm a prude, don't you?

1055
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,200
- I don't know what you are.
- You must think I'm something.

1056
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,700
Yeah, you're something all buttoned up.
All except one button.

1057
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,600
Oh, isn't it awful?
It's a nervous habit, I guess. So silly.

1058
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:37,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I just wasn't thinking.

1059
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:41,700
It's so delicious. That Bacardi flavouring
certainly makes a difference.

1060
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:45,200
Oh, yeah. Nine times out of ten.

1061
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,900
You know, this would be a wonderful way
to get children to drink milk.

1062
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,000
A melody can have the same notes,
but suddenly it's a different song.

1063
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,700
- Again, please?
- That song.

1064
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,900
Before it was just romantic,
just silly slush.

1065
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,200
But now it's playing inside of me,
all true and honest,

1066
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,200
as if my heart were beating the drum.

1067
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,500
How much do you know about life?

1068
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,800
Only a little bit. Around the edges.

1069
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,100
Tell me about life.

1070
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,700
- All about it?
- How to live.

1071
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,100
Doing what you want, having
what you want, saying what you want.

1072
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:54,600
- Being what you want.
- Nobody can. Nobody does.

1073
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:59,200
- If you could, you wouldn't want it.
- But you're wrong, Brother Sky.

1074
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:04,200
- All right. You tell me about life.
- You don't believe I could. Don't you?

1075
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:10,200
I believe I could. After all, it was you
that came to me for help, isn't that so?

1076
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,900
Because you were unhappy.
What were you unhappy about, Sky?

1077
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:20,300
- Well, I can't remember this minute.
- But you do remember that I failed you.

1078
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,600
I was weighed in the balance
and found wanting.

1079
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,600
Daniel 5:27.

1080
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,100
For that I am truly sorry.

1081
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,200
But I intend to make it up to you.

1082
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,100
I intend to give you
all the help you will ever require.

1083
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:42,800
- You have given me a lot of help already.
- You don't think I remember, don't you?

1084
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:47,900
But I do. Every word,
as if you were saying it now.

1085
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,700
- What?
- About having a more...

1086
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,100
personal help in mind.

1087
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:59,100
But I gave you those silly old pamphlets,

1088
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:03,500
as if they could take the place
of a truly personal help.

1089
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:17,300
How can a sinner hope to be saved by an
hour of help when for the rest of the 24

1090
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,000
- he must fight temptation alone?
- How indeed?

1091
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,800
It's been done with people
who drink too much, you know.

1092
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,500
Help day and night, night and day.

1093
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,900
- Anywhere, anytime.
- That's a full-time job.

1094
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,300
Well, you're a full-time sinner.

1095
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,000
Maybe a little time off
for good behaviour?

1096
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,900
Pal, you're not gonna
fight alone any more.

1097
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:44,400
- What if it's against mission policies?
- Because I'm gonna be with you.

1098
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,300
A one-woman mission
for the personal salvation of me?

1099
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,000
Day and night, night and day.

1100
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:53,200
Sister Sarah, why would you want to?

1101
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,800
Whatever you do, wherever you go.

1102
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:58,100
Why, Sister Sarah? Why?

1103
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,900
- I wanna be with you.
- The world's full of souls

1104
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,700
- closer to salvation than mine.
- Anytime, anywhere.

1105
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,400
Easier to save
and much more worth saving.

1106
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,600
You...

1107
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,900
Please say something.

1108
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,400
I've got to know what you're thinking.

1109
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,900
I'm thinking...

1110
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,000
It's time you had your dinner.

1111
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,500
Still dizzy?

1112
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,700
You won't believe me, but with my head
underwater I actually heard bells ringing.

1113
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,800
I'll believe ya.

1114
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:56,900
- Ask me how do I feel.
- How do you feel?

1115
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:05,200
Ask me now that
we're cosy and clinging

1116
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,400
Well, sir, all I can say

1117
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:13,300
Is if I were a bell I'd be ringing

1118
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:18,200
From the moment we kissed tonight

1119
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,400
That's the way I've just got to behave

1120
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,300
Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light

1121
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,800
And if I were a banner I'd wave

1122
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,600
Ask me how do I feel

1123
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:38,400
Little me with my quiet upbringing

1124
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,400
Well, sir, all I can say

1125
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:46,900
Is if I were a gate I'd be swinging

1126
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:54,500
And if I were a watch
I'd start poppin' my springs

1127
01:31:55,300 --> 01:32:01,600
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong ding dong ding

1128
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,800
Ask me how do I feel

1129
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:10,200
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning

1130
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:12,400
- Chemistry?
- Yeah, chemistry!

1131
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:18,500
All I can say is if I were a bridge
I'd be burning

1132
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:23,200
Yes, I knew my morale would crack

1133
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:27,500
From the wonderful way that you looked

1134
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,000
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack

1135
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:35,300
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked

1136
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,700
Ask me how do I feel

1137
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:42,800
Ask me now that we're fondly caressing

1138
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:50,300
Pal, if I were a salad
I know I'd be splashing my dressing

1139
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:57,400
Ask me how to describe
this whole beautiful thing

1140
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:06,200
Well, if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong ding dong

1141
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:10,900
Ding

1142
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:35,800
We just got time to catch
the last plane to New York.

1143
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:38,400
People miss planes. It happens.

1144
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,700
Yeah.

1145
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:45,900
It also happens that people
win with loaded dice.

1146
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,100
I know what I'm doing.

1147
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,900
Do you, kid?

1148
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,100
I don't.

1149
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:01,400
Suddenly I'm playin'
by a whole new book of rules.

1150
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:05,900
You make me feel as if I were
a dishonest horse race or something.

1151
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,500
Look, the bells rang. They really rang.
They weren't magical bells for lovers,

1152
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,700
full of rum and music
on a make-believe island.

1153
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,400
They rang to tell us what time it is.

1154
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,700
Shall we synchronise our watches?

1155
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:22,700
Sarah, I know the night-time. I live in it.

1156
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,100
It does funny things to you.

1157
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:31,500
You must be trying to tell me
I'd hate myself in the morning.

1158
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:38,500
I look as if I've been
in a fight or something.

1159
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,500
You know, you're the most mixed-up man

1160
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,400
- I've ever met in my life.
- Easily.

1161
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:49,500
All that nonsense about night-time
and daytime and rule books and such.

1162
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,600
Sarah...

1163
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,300
You know why I brought you
here to Havana?

1164
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,900
Because I made a bet that I could.

1165
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:05,200
That's why I came to the mission,
to win a bet.

1166
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,600
Why not? You're a gambler.

1167
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,600
And, darling,

1168
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,800
you are also a chump.

1169
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,900
We're blocks from the mission.

1170
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,000
Come on. A little walk will do you good.

1171
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,300
What time is it?

1172
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,400
It's dawn any minute.

1173
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:15,800
What makes the light
so strange and white?

1174
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,800
Because only in Times Square...
the dawn gets turned on by an electrician.

1175
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,200
- Listen.
- What?

1176
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,300
Footsteps.

1177
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,900
Now is the time you can hear
footsteps on Broadway.

1178
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,400
Cup of coffee?

1179
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,400
Doughnut?

1180
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,900
You remember that tune pretty well.

1181
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,600
It keeps running through my heart.

1182
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:56,000
It's got words, you know.

1183
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:59,200
Something about "amor, amor", I'll bet.

1184
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,600
It's about you.

1185
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,300
About you right now.

1186
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:14,100
Your eyes are the eyes

1187
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,400
Of a woman in love

1188
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:25,400
And oh how they give you away

1189
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:30,100
Why try to deny

1190
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,900
You're a woman in love

1191
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,900
When I know very well

1192
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:40,900
What I say

1193
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:45,600
I say no moon in the sky

1194
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:48,700
Ever lent such a glow

1195
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,100
Some flame deep within

1196
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,500
Made them shine

1197
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:00,800
Those eyes are the eyes

1198
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:05,600
Of a woman in love

1199
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:09,100
And may they gaze

1200
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:14,200
Ever more into mine

1201
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:19,000
Tenderly gaze

1202
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,400
Ever more

1203
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:24,700
Into mine

1204
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:28,400
And what about you?

1205
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:33,900
It's got you too

1206
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:40,300
Your eyes are the eyes

1207
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,600
Of a man who's in love

1208
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:48,100
That same flame deep within

1209
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:50,700
Made them shine

1210
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:56,700
Your eyes are the eyes

1211
01:39:56,700 --> 01:40:00,700
-  Of a man who's in love
-  Woman in love

1212
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,800
And may they gaze

1213
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,900
Ever more

1214
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,400
Into mine

1215
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,600
Crazily gaze

1216
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:18,100
Ever more

1217
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:26,500
Into mine

1218
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,500
Uncle Arvide!

1219
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,400
- Where have you been?
- Good morning, Sarah.

1220
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,400
Morning, Brother Sky.
Well, we took your advice.

1221
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:49,500
We've been out all night
on a crusade against the devil.

1222
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:05,100
Come on, fellas. The cops!
Come on, guys, let's get outta here.

1223
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,400
- Nathan, what is this?
- Bingo!

1224
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:19,700
Wait a minute. Where y'all goin'?
I'm out ten Gs.

1225
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:36,900
It's no use. They were tipped off.

1226
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:41,000
I suppose you can explain all this,
Miss Brown?

1227
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:43,300
Explain? Explain what?

1228
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:48,300
I guess it was just a coincidence that the
mission was open and empty all night

1229
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,600
while everybody suddenly
took off on an all-night crusade.

1230
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:56,600
But you yourself didn't go on the crusade
and you weren't here.

1231
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:59,500
Now, maybe that's two coincidences.

1232
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:04,700
Masterson, I had you in my big-time book.

1233
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,000
Now I suppose I'll have to reclassify you -
under "shills and decoys".

1234
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:36,100
You certainly do know the night-time,
don't you, and the funny things it does.

1235
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:41,000
- It certainly did them to me, didn't it?
- You only have to answer one question.

1236
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:45,100
It didn't do too much, though, thanks
to you, not me. Just more than enough.

1237
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,000
- Answer one question.
- Any.

1238
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,900
Am I now supposed to prove
I had nothing to do with this?

1239
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,900
- There's nothing to prove.
- Are you saying I'm guilty?

1240
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,800
Everything has already been proved. If I
hadn't gone, this wouldn't have happened.

1241
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:01,100
- You went with me to help the mission.
- Did I?

1242
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:05,000
I can't remember that far back.

1243
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:07,500
Oh, Sarah.

1244
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:12,000
Is that really why I went with you?
To help the mission?

1245
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,600
- Is that really why you took me?
- To win the bet. I told you.

1246
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:19,300
Was that all of the bet, Sky,
to get me out of the way?

1247
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,900
- What do you take me for?
- Or was there more? Much more?

1248
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,300
Did you win the bet?
Did you truly win all of the bet?

1249
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,900
What do you take yourself for?

1250
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,600
- What kind of a doll are you?
- A daytime doll.

1251
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,700
A mission doll.

1252
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:17,200
Thank you. And now the feature attraction
of our all-new Four-D Follies,

1253
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:21,500
the Hot Box proudly presents
Miss Adelaide and her Debutantes.

1254
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:30,000
- Nicely-nicely, thank you.
- I didn't ask you how you are.

1255
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:31,900
- Don't.
- What are you doing here?

1256
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,800
- Where's Nathan?
- Nathan. That's what I'm doin' here.

1257
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:37,300
I'm supposed to bring
Miss Adelaide a message.

1258
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:40,600
I wish Nathan would bring
his own messages.

1259
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,300
He bought me the fur thing
five winters ago

1260
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:59,100
And the gown the following fall

1261
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:03,200
Then the necklace, the bag,
the hat and the shoes

1262
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:07,400
Oh what generous gifts I recall

1263
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:12,400
Then last night in his apartment

1264
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:17,100
He tried to remove them all

1265
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:23,600
And I said as I ran down the hall

1266
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:29,200
Take back your mink

1267
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,600
Take back your pearls

1268
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,300
What made you think

1269
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:39,000
That I was one of those girls?

1270
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,500
Take back the gown

1271
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,000
The shoes and the hat

1272
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,300
I may be down

1273
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:52,400
But I'm not flat as all that

1274
01:45:54,500 --> 01:46:00,200
I thought that each expensive gift you'd
arranged was a token of your esteem

1275
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:05,000
Now when I think of
what you want in exchange

1276
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:11,700
It all seems a horrible dream

1277
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:15,900
So take back your mink

1278
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:19,100
To from whence it came

1279
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:24,000
And tell them to shorten the sleeves

1280
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:29,000
For some other dame

1281
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,800
Take back your mink

1282
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,600
Take back your pearls

1283
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,400
What made you think

1284
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,500
That I was one of those girls?

1285
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:44,700
I'm screaming take back the gown

1286
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,400
Take back the hat

1287
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,200
I may be down

1288
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:52,600
But I'm not flat as all that

1289
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:58,100
I thought that each expensive gift you'd
arranged was a token of your esteem

1290
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,500
But when I think
of what you want in exchange

1291
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,300
It all seems a horrible dream

1292
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,800
Take back your mink

1293
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,900
Those old worn-out pelts

1294
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,800
And go shorten the sleeves

1295
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:15,000
For somebody else

1296
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,300
Well, wouldn't you?

1297
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,300
I cannot do it. I cannot bring
myself to tell Miss Adelaide

1298
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,700
Nathan is not going to elope with her.

1299
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,300
- She is counting on him.
- Nathan is what he is.

1300
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:45,000
She oughta know better.
I thought the game broke up last night.

1301
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:48,400
Big Jule, being a large loser,
is insistent that the game goes on.

1302
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:51,500
- We find a place and the game goes on.
- Where?

1303
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,900
I could take you there,
but I must deliver this message first.

1304
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,800
I'll deliver it.
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1305
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:00,800
If you're lookin' for action,
the boys are pretty tired.

1306
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:03,500
No, I'm leaving town tonight, but I...

1307
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:08,500
I gave my marker to somebody
and I wanna make it good before I leave.

1308
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:19,900
You know something, Sky?
Suddenly I'm embarrassed.

1309
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,200
- I don't know which etiquette to use.
- Etiquette?

1310
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:27,600
Well, your being here tonight must have
something to do with the wedding.

1311
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:31,400
Nathan must have sent you
as one of his seconds or something?

1312
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:35,800
- Well, Nathan didn't exactly send me.
- Then I don't understand.

1313
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:39,000
I'm supposed to give you
a message from him.

1314
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:44,100
He's out there, isn't he? I mean,
Nathan's here tonight in the Hot Box?

1315
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,300
No.

1316
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:49,300
But tonight...

1317
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:52,100
Sky, we're eloping tonight.

1318
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:56,800
We're getting married tonight. In front of
all those people we talked about it.

1319
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:00,500
- Sky, he's just gotta be here!
- Well, he isn't.

1320
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:04,500
It seems that one of
Nathan's close relatives...

1321
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:07,500
- His aunt in Pittsburgh?
- That's the one.

1322
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:11,300
His floating aunt in Pittsburgh.

1323
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:16,800
- It's the crap game again.
- Does it surprise you? You know Nathan.

1324
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:19,800
- But he promised to change.
- Change!

1325
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:23,100
Who do you wanna marry? Nathan
or what you wanna make out of him?

1326
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:26,100
I wanna marry
and live normal like people.

1327
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:30,700
I wanna have a normal home
with wallpaper and book ends.

1328
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:34,700
Well, then, fall in love with people.
Not with gamblers.

1329
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:43,700
Adelaide...

1330
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:47,700
My daddy once told me:
No matter who you get married to,

1331
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:52,900
you wake up married to somebody else.
You take it the way the dice falls.

1332
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:57,300
But a guy doesn't wanna feel that
he's just like a piece of material

1333
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:01,600
a woman'll cut up and sew according to
the way they wear husbands this year.

1334
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:06,000
It's easy for you to talk.
You're not in love with Nathan.

1335
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,600
No, I'm not.

1336
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,800
Wait till you fall in love
with somebody you shouldn't.

1337
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,800
Wait till it happens to you.

1338
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:20,700
Yeah...

1339
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,900
Must be tough to take.

1340
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:39,500
I don't think Sky had any more to do with
what happened here last night than I did.

1341
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:43,400
That's why you buy
solid gold watches for a dollar.

1342
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:47,900
- Do you believe it?
- Whether he had a hand in it or not...

1343
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,700
- Do you believe it?
- They used our mission for their game.

1344
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:56,100
- But if Sky had nothing to do with it...
- Don't you understand?!

1345
01:51:56,200 --> 01:52:01,700
All I could see was him running away
from the police with the rest of that trash.

1346
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,100
All I could see was that
he was one of them.

1347
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:12,600
And I never saw till now
how much in love with him you are.

1348
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:16,300
- I'll get over it.
- Why would anyone wanna get over

1349
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:20,400
the thing you hope for from the minute
you're born and remember till you die?

1350
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:23,400
- I'll get over it.
- Why?

1351
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:27,200
Because it's the greatest reward
that woman or man can have,

1352
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:29,800
to love and to be loved?

1353
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,700
I just wanna remind you.

1354
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:41,400
You hold my marker for 12
or more sinners by midnight tonight.

1355
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:45,300
- Forget about it.
- I do not forget a marker.

1356
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:53,100
Well, last night the mission was filled
with your friends. Let's say we're even.

1357
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:07,100
If you don't make that marker good,
I'll buzz it all over town you're a welsher.

1358
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,300
- Time is running out. Where's the game?
- Only a ten-minute walk.

1359
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,500
- Which way?
- This way.

1360
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,900
Wait a minute! Where y'all goin'?

1361
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,200
- I come here to shoot crap.
- I had enough.

1362
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:14,400
How many days we all been here?

1363
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:18,800
As you can see, Big Jule,
the boys are fatigued from weariness,

1364
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,500
having been shooting crap
for quite a while now, namely 24 hours.

1365
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:26,900
I don't care who's tired.
I'm out 25 Gs. Nobody leaves.

1366
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,600
I am half dead.

1367
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:32,000
If you do not shut up,
Big Jule will arrange the other half.

1368
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:38,500
And since I've been cleaned out of cash,
I announce that I will now play on credit.

1369
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,700
Big Jule, you cannot imagine
how exhausted they are.

1370
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:48,000
Especially on a non-cash basis.
Me, personally, I'm fresh as a daisy.

1371
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:51,200
- Then I'll play with you.
- But I am not a player.

1372
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:54,700
- I am merely the operator.
- You been raking down out of every pot.

1373
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,700
You must have quite a bundle.

1374
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:00,200
Being I assume the risk, is it not fair
I should assume some dough?

1375
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:04,900
Detroit, I'm gonna roll ya, willy or nilly.

1376
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:08,500
If I lose... I'll give you my marker.

1377
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:12,900
- And if I lose?
- You will give him cash.

1378
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,100
Let me hear from Big Jule.

1379
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:17,700
You'll give me cash.

1380
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:19,800
I heard.

1381
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:23,000
Here's my marker. Put up your dough.

1382
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:28,400
- Anything wrong?
- "IOU one thousand. Signed X."

1383
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:31,600
How can you write "one thousand"
but not your signature?

1384
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:35,100
I was good in arithmetic
but I stunk in English.

1385
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,100
Here. This'll put you through Harvard.

1386
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:42,600
I'm rollin' the whole thousand.

1387
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:49,400
And to change my luck,
I'm going to use my own dice.

1388
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:54,500
- Your own dice?
- I had 'em made especially in Chicago.

1389
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:59,500
I do not wish to seem petty,
but may I have a look at those dice?

1390
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:06,600
But these dice ain't got no spots on 'em.
They're blank.

1391
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:11,300
I had the spots removed for luck. But I
remember where the spots formerly were.

1392
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:15,900
You are going to roll blank dice
and remember where the spots were?

1393
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:20,600
Detroit... do you doubt my memory?

1394
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:24,200
Big Jule, I have great trust in you.

1395
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:31,000
Five and a five. Ten. My points: ten.

1396
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,200
At least I got a chance.
He remembered a hard point.

1397
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,900
Ten. I win. Six and a four.

1398
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:42,800
- Which is the six and which is the four?
- Either way. I'm rollin' the 2,000.

1399
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,200
Seven. I win.

1400
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:52,800
I could have sworn
he would've remembered that.

1401
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:55,100
Detroit...

1402
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:58,300
I'm gonna take it easy with you this time.

1403
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,900
I'm shootin' a dollar.

1404
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:04,400
I'll cover all of it.

1405
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:10,600
How do ya like that? Snake eyes. I lose.

1406
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:13,800
I won't even bother to pick it up.
Benny, pick it up.

1407
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:18,200
Detroit, I'm gonna give you a chance
to get even. I'm rollin' three Gs.

1408
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,600
Three Gs! But that's my whole bankroll.

1409
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:24,200
Three Gs. Get it up.

1410
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:28,300
Well, here we go.

1411
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:31,400
Down memory lane.

1412
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:37,700
Lucky me. Eleven.

1413
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:40,100
- I win.
- I'm clean.

1414
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:46,600
Seein' that I'm on a lucky streak,
I will now roll the rest of you guys.

1415
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:51,500
Wait a minute. You have got to
give me a chance to get even.

1416
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:53,600
I will now roll you with my dice.

1417
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:57,700
- What you gonna use for money?
- I will give you my marker.

1418
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:01,600
And against your marker,
you want Big Jule to put up cash?

1419
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:04,100
- Nathan done it.
- Yeah, I done it.

1420
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,600
- What kind of a deal is this?
- Take it easy.

1421
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:10,600
Him and his no-spot dice! Somebody
oughta knock the spots off of him.

1422
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:14,400
Hey, Nathan, do not make Big Jule
have to do somethin' to you.

1423
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:17,500
Detroit, I'm on my vacation.
Don't louse it up.

1424
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:21,200
What could you do me?
Shoot me? Put me in cement?

1425
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:25,300
At least I would know where I am.
I risk my neck to set up this crap game.

1426
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:29,300
I even promise to get married on
account of it. And where do I wind up?

1427
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:33,000
Broke, in a sewer. Believe me,
my tough friend from Chicago,

1428
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:35,900
nothing you could do to me
would not cheer me up.

1429
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,500
Here they are.

1430
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:45,200
- And how is everybody down here?
- I smell fresh blood. Lookin' for action?

1431
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:48,800
Not at the moment. I just came
to talk to some of my friends.

1432
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:51,700
- We're shootin' crap.
- It'll only take a minute.

1433
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:54,300
We're shootin' crap.

1434
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:59,000
I would like to talk to you
about Sarah Brown's mission,

1435
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:01,400
where you were interrupted last night.

1436
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:05,800
What kind of characters walk around the
sewers of New York? Who is this joker?

1437
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:11,000
Like I told you, he is the guy who was
tryin' to take the mission doll to Havana.

1438
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:16,700
Oh, him. I suggest you return the way
you came, back to your prayin' tomato.

1439
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:20,200
Around here your presence
is slowin' up the action.

1440
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:25,400
If you are so eager for action, would you
care to make a wager on a proposition?

1441
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:29,900
- Pray tell, what's the proposition?
- An old one my daddy taught me.

1442
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,800
- Now am I right-handed or left-handed?
- Now how would I know a thing like that?

1443
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:37,200
Well, I will give you a clue.

1444
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:49,000
Nathan, give me that gu...

1445
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:53,500
Now, to continue with
what I was talking about...

1446
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,800
Tonight in the mission
they are holding a prayer meeting.

1447
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:00,600
I promised to supply
that meeting with some sinners.

1448
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:06,400
When it comes to sinners, no sewer in the
world could provide such a congregation.

1449
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,800
I would consider it
a very great personal favour...

1450
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:18,500
I don't wanna spend no time
in no hallelujah joint.

1451
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:22,500
If not as a favour to me,
a favour to yourselves.

1452
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:26,600
The air in the mission smells cleaner
than it does down here.

1453
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:29,300
Rusty Charlie?

1454
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:32,300
Society Max?

1455
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:38,000
If anybody else would go, I would also go,
Sky. But you know me - I go anywhere.

1456
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:42,100
Well, thanks, Nathan,
but just you alone is not enough.

1457
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:46,200
Well, I tried.

1458
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:48,800
Sky...

1459
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:51,500
About that Havana business.

1460
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:55,200
I regret that I temporarily
do not have the 1,000 to pay you.

1461
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:57,900
I'm glad you reminded me, Nathan.

1462
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,100
You won the bet.

1463
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,500
But I thought you took
Miss Sarah to Havana.

1464
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:05,900
You thought wrong.

1465
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,600
Get on your feet, Big Jule.
I now have dough to roll you again.

1466
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:13,800
- But with real dice.
- Nothin' doin'.

1467
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:18,100
With honest dice, Big Jule
cannot make a pass to save his soul.

1468
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:20,700
- What did you say?
- I said, with real dice,

1469
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,900
Big Jule cannot make a pass
to save his soul.

1470
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,300
That's very interesting.

1471
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,400
Then maybe with honest dice,

1472
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:32,100
I can make a pass to save his soul.

1473
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:35,200
And yours and yours and yours.

1474
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:39,400
I'm gonna roll these dice.

1475
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:44,800
One roll. And on that roll I'm gonna bet
each of you $1,000 against your soul.

1476
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:49,800
1,000 cash against a marker for your soul.

1477
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:55,300
If I win, all of you show up
at the mission tonight. Have I got a bet?

1478
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:58,700
Let me get this - hold it. Let me get this.

1479
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:02,000
If you lose, then you gotta
give us each 1,000 bucks?

1480
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:06,400
But if you win, then we all gotta
show up at the mission doll's cabaret?

1481
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:09,200
Save-A-Soul Mission, midnight.
One meeting.

1482
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:12,700
- If you lose, 1,000 apiece?
- 1,000 apiece.

1483
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:16,300
- Well, that's OK by me.
- What have I got to lose?

1484
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:26,600
What's the delay, Sky?
You turnin' chicken?

1485
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:31,000
You know better than that, Horse.
You've seen me roll for twice as much.

1486
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:37,200
Only I got...

1487
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:40,500
I got a lot more than money
riding on this one.

1488
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:48,300
They call you Lady Luck

1489
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:52,500
But there is room for doubt

1490
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:58,400
At times you have a very unladylike way

1491
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,500
Of runnin' out

1492
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:04,200
You're on this date with me

1493
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:07,800
The pickings have been lush

1494
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:12,100
And yet before this evening is over

1495
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:15,500
You might give me the brush

1496
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:21,200
You might forget your manners,
you might refuse to stay

1497
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:26,500
And so the best that I can do

1498
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:30,100
Is pray

1499
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:33,500
Luck, be a lady tonight

1500
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:36,700
Luck, be a lady tonight

1501
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:40,800
Luck, if you've ever been
a lady to begin with

1502
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:44,500
Luck, be a lady tonight

1503
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:47,800
Luck, let a gentleman see

1504
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:51,100
How nice a dame you can be

1505
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:55,000
I know the way you've treated
other guys you've been with

1506
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:58,200
Luck, be a lady with me

1507
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:02,500
A lady doesn't leave her escort

1508
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,600
It isn't fair, it isn't nice

1509
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:09,100
A lady doesn't wander all over the room

1510
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:11,500
And blow on some other guy's dice

1511
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:14,500
So let's keep the party polite

1512
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:17,800
Never get out of my sight

1513
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,700
Stick with me, baby,
I'm the fella you came in with

1514
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:23,900
Luck, be a lady

1515
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:27,000
Luck, be a lady

1516
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:30,400
Luck, be a lady tonight

1517
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:03,400
A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers

1518
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:06,400
She'd have a heart, she'd have a soul

1519
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
A lady wouldn't make
little snake eyes at me

1520
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:12,700
When I've bet my life on this roll

1521
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,900
So let's keep the party polite

1522
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,600
Why don't he shoot?

1523
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:19,400
-  Never get out of my sight
-  Come on! Quit stalling!

1524
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:22,800
Stick with me, baby,
I'm the fella you came in with

1525
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:25,500
-  Be a lady
-  Sky's turnin' yellow!

1526
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:28,700
-  Luck, be a lady
-  What are you scared of?

1527
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,700
-  Luck, be a lady
-  What's the matter? Roll the dice!

1528
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:34,100
-  Tonight
-  Comin' out, comin' out

1529
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:37,200
Comin' out, comin' out, comin' out right

1530
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:46,900
- I tell ya, I don't wanna go there!
- But, Big Jule, you give your marker.

1531
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,400
And if you welsh, this will
cause me no little embarrassment.

1532
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:53,400
I am sure you do not wanna
cause me embarrassment.

1533
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:58,000
Well, if it ever gets back to Chicago
that I went to a prayer meeting,

1534
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:00,800
no decent person will talk to me.

1535
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:16,800
- Adelaide!
- How clumsy of me.

1536
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:19,500
So sorry. An awkward coincident.

1537
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:24,600
Adelaide, listen. I sent Nicely
especially to explain about tonight.

1538
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:29,900
- If you knew what I'd been through.
- Please. Let us not have a vulgar scene.

1539
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,700
After all, we're civilised people. We do
not have to conduct ourselves like a slob.

1540
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:43,700
Adelaide, what is this? How can you be
so upset over one lousy elopement?

1541
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:49,300
I am not upset. I have succeeded in
your not being able to upset me no more.

1542
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:51,900
I have got you completely out of my...

1543
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:56,700
- Gesundheit.
- ..system.

1544
02:09:58,700 --> 02:10:01,000
Oh, Nathan!

1545
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:04,500
Adelaide, baby.

1546
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:08,600
Don't do that to me.
I can't stand it when you cry.

1547
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:13,800
Look, we'll get married, I promise you.
And we'll have what you always wanted.

1548
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:17,100
A little white house with a green fence.

1549
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:20,400
Just like the Whitney colours.

1550
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:24,200
Oh, Nathan. If I could only believe you.

1551
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:28,000
We could still make everything all right.

1552
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:31,600
- We could elope right now.
- Adelaide, could we?

1553
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:41,000
I almost forgot...
but right at this time I cannot.

1554
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:43,200
- Why not?
- I'm gonna tell the truth,

1555
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:47,600
- but you will not believe me.
- Nathan, why can't we elope?

1556
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:50,300
I have to go to a prayer meeting.

1557
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:54,200
That is the biggest and most
unforgivable lie you have ever told me.

1558
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:56,200
It's true. I promise you.

1559
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:58,100
You promise me this,
you promise me that

1560
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:00,500
You promise me everything
under the sun, but you give me a kiss

1561
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:02,700
And you're grabbin' your hat
and you're off to the races again

1562
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:06,200
-  When I think of the time gone by
- Adelaide, Adelaide...

1563
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:10,000
-  And I think of the way I try
- Adelaide...

1564
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:13,600
I could honestly die

1565
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:18,800
Call a lawyer and sue me, sue me

1566
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:21,400
What can you do me?

1567
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:23,600
I love you

1568
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:27,700
Give a holler and hate me, hate me

1569
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:31,000
-  Go ahead, hate me, I love you
-  The best years of my life

1570
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,300
I was a fool to give to you

1571
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:36,400
All right already,
I'm just a no-goodnik

1572
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:39,100
All right already, it's true

1573
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:41,000
So nu?

1574
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:44,300
So sue me, sue me

1575
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:46,800
What can you do me?

1576
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:49,800
I love you

1577
02:11:49,900 --> 02:11:53,100
You gamble it here, you gamble it there,
you gamble on everything all except me

1578
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:56,000
And I'm sick of you keepin' me up in
the air till you're back in the money again

1579
02:11:56,100 --> 02:11:59,400
-  When I think of the time gone by
- Adelaide, Adelaide...

1580
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:02,900
-  And I think of the way I try
- Adelaide...

1581
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,900
I could honestly die

1582
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:21,000
Serve a paper and sue me, sue me

1583
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:24,000
What can you do me?

1584
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:26,600
I love you

1585
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:30,200
Give a holler and hate me, hate me

1586
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:33,200
-  Go ahead, hate me, I love you
-  When you wind up in jail

1587
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:35,900
Don't come to me to bail you out

1588
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,900
All right already, so call a policeman

1589
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:41,800
All right already, it's true

1590
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:43,800
So nu?

1591
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:47,200
So sue me, sue me

1592
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:50,000
What can you do me?

1593
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:55,800
I love you

1594
02:12:58,300 --> 02:13:00,000
You're at it again,
you're running the game

1595
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:01,600
I'm not gonna play second fiddle to that

1596
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:04,500
I'm sick and I'm tired of starting a row
and I'm telling you now that we're through

1597
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:07,800
-  When I think of the time gone by
- Adelaide, Adelaide...

1598
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:11,500
-  And I think of the way I try
- Adelaide!

1599
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:15,800
I could honestly die

1600
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:21,300
Sue me, sue me

1601
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:24,700
Shoot bullets through me

1602
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:32,100
I love you

1603
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:52,300
According to my wrist chronometer,
it's well past midnight.

1604
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:56,200
If this big meeting were going
to be as big as you'd hoped,

1605
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:59,100
- by now somebody...
- You're quite right, General.

1606
02:13:59,200 --> 02:14:02,900
- Sarah.
- Why keep up this silly pretending?

1607
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,900
It was childish of us to think we could
suddenly make sinners appear

1608
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,800
when we've failed
so miserably up to now.

1609
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:13,300
And when I say "we", General,
I mean I've failed.

1610
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:21,800
Welcome, brothers, welcome!
Come in, come in!

1611
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:25,100
Come on. Move in. Move in. Everybody in.

1612
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:27,100
Hats off. Step along.

1613
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:29,300
You too, Big Jule.

1614
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:31,500
Move it. Come on, kid.

1615
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,500
Keep movin'. Come on.

1616
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:42,600
Is everybody accounted for?

1617
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:46,500
- Where's Nathan Detroit?
- Present.

1618
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:48,700
All right.

1619
02:14:54,700 --> 02:14:58,300
Well, I made good my marker.
I oughta ask you to return it,

1620
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:01,600
but it would break up
your pretty set of thoughts for today.

1621
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:05,200
When you get around to it,
mark it "paid in full".

1622
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:07,600
Won't you gentlemen sit down?

1623
02:15:07,700 --> 02:15:10,200
Sit down. Do as you're told.

1624
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:20,800
On behalf of General Cartwright, Sergeant
Sarah Brown and the rest of us...

1625
02:15:20,900 --> 02:15:25,900
The army's certainly changed. In the next
war I wanna be a Red Cross nurse.

1626
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,200
Quiet!

1627
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:32,200
I would like to remind you, you are
no longer on your knees in a sewer,

1628
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:37,700
but sitting in a mission. I trust that
there will be no further unpleasantness.

1629
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:41,200
And now,
since I depart to move on to other places,

1630
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:44,100
I'm appointing
Nathan Detroit as my deputy.

1631
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:48,500
Nathan, I hand you all their markers,
to be returned when they are made good.

1632
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:51,600
Anybody who does not play
strictly according to Hoyle

1633
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:54,100
will answer to me personally.

1634
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:56,500
And that means in person.

1635
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:02,800
What a remarkable young man.

1636
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:10,700
I will add nothin' to what Sky said,
except to say that there are many here

1637
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:15,200
upon who, if they get outta line,
I would squeal with pleasure.

1638
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:18,400
Brother Arvide, your dice.

1639
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:25,000
Gentlemen, our meeting will be
conducted by the regional director

1640
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:28,400
of the Save-A-Soul Mission,
General Cartwright.

1641
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:37,300
I have rarely attended a meeting
in any of our branches

1642
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:41,100
which could boast of
so many evil-Iooking sinners.

1643
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:47,000
Now surely your hearts must be heavy
with sins to which you want to confess.

1644
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:50,300
Who will be the first to start
by giving testimony?

1645
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:55,100
- Benny Southstreet, give testimony.
- I plead the fifth commandment.

1646
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:58,600
Come, brothers.
We know how difficult it is.

1647
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:01,800
But if one will open your heart,
the others will follow.

1648
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:06,000
Benny, this is an order.
Tell the people what a bum you are.

1649
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:12,900
Well... I was always a bad guy.

1650
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,700
I was even a bad gambler. I would like
to be a good guy and a good gambler.

1651
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:20,000
I thank you.

1652
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,800
- Who will be next?
- Big Jule.

1653
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:25,700
What's the pitch?

1654
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:29,600
Tell the people all the terrible things
you done but ain't gonna do no more.

1655
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:32,000
And watch your language.

1656
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:38,000
Well, I used to be bad when I was a kid.

1657
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:42,400
But ever since then I've gone straight,
as I can prove by my record -

1658
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:45,700
33 arrests and no convictions.

1659
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:49,300
- Horse.
- No.

1660
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:52,300
- Harry the Horse.
- Go ahead.

1661
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:59,200
Well, when Sky was rollin' us
against our souls, I...

1662
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:01,900
- I beg your pardon?
- Sky Masterson.

1663
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,100
He rolled us 1,000 bucks.
That's why we're here.

1664
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:08,900
- I don't think I understand.
- I'll interpret for you, General.

1665
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:14,400
He means that they are here only because
Sky Masterson won them in a dice game.

1666
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:19,800
Then this whole meeting,
in a way, is the result of gambling.

1667
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:22,400
Fire fought with fire.

1668
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:25,100
Sergeant Sarah,
you are to be congratulated.

1669
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:27,300
Congratulations, Sarah.

1670
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:31,800
Thank you so much.

1671
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:36,500
I ain't finished my testimony yet.

1672
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:41,500
So, my sin is that when Sky was rollin' us,

1673
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:46,100
I wished that I could win the 1,000 bucks
instead of havin' to come here.

1674
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:48,100
But now that I'm here,

1675
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:50,300
I still wish it.

1676
02:18:52,700 --> 02:18:56,900
Something very funny has been
happening to me. Sitting here, I mean.

1677
02:18:56,900 --> 02:18:59,700
Like I've been remembering a dream.

1678
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:08,200
Tell us, Nicely. Tell us in your own words.

1679
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,900
Yeah, that's it. A dream.

1680
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:16,300
I dreamed last night
I got on the boat to heaven

1681
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:20,300
And by some chance
I had brought my dice along

1682
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:24,000
And there I stood
and I hollered "Someone fade me!"

1683
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:30,700
But the passengers,
they knew right from wrong

1684
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,500
For the people all said sit down,
sit down, you're rockin' the boat

1685
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:37,500
People all said sit down,
sit down, you're rockin' the boat

1686
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:41,100
And the devil'll drag you under
by the sharp lapel of your chequered coat

1687
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:45,900
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down,
sit down, you're rockin' the boat

1688
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:51,700
I sailed away
on that little boat to heaven

1689
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:55,100
And by some chance
found a bottle in my fist

1690
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:58,900
And there I stood,
nicely passin' out the whisky

1691
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:05,400
But the passengers were bound to resist

1692
02:20:05,700 --> 02:20:09,200
For the people all said beware,
you're on a heavenly trip

1693
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:12,300
People all said beware,
beware, you'll scuttle the ship

1694
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:15,800
And the devil'll drag you under
by the fancy tie round your wicked throat

1695
02:20:15,900 --> 02:20:19,300
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down,
sit down, you're rockin' the boat

1696
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:24,000
And as I laughed
at those passengers to heaven

1697
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:29,700
A great big wave came
and washed me overboard

1698
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:33,300
And as I sank and I hollered
"Someone save me!"

1699
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:36,200
That's the moment I woke up

1700
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:40,300
-  Thank the Lord
-  Thank the Lord

1701
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:43,300
Thank the Lord

1702
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:47,300
And I said to myself sit down,
sit down, you're rockin' the boat

1703
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:50,800
Said to myself sit down,
sit down, you're rockin' the boat

1704
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:54,000
And the devil'll drag you under,
with a soul so heavy you'd never float

1705
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,500
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down,
sit down, you're rockin' the boat

1706
02:20:57,500 --> 02:21:00,100
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down,
you're rockin' the boat

1707
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:02,500
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down,
you're rockin' the boat

1708
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:05,500
-  Sit down
-  You're rockin'

1709
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:09,500
The boat

1710
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:22,700
Now, Brother Brannigan,
what can we do for you?

1711
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:24,900
Maybe you would like to testify?

1712
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,200
I'll do my testifying in court,

1713
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:32,000
where I will testify that you ran a
crap game here in the mission last night.

1714
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,100
A crap game? In the mission?

1715
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:39,500
Miss Sarah, you were standing right there
when they ran out. You saw them.

1716
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:42,100
Aren't these the men?

1717
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:52,500
You must be mistaken, Lieutenant.

1718
02:21:53,500 --> 02:21:56,500
I never saw these gentlemen
before in my life.

1719
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:00,900
There's a right broad.

1720
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:06,300
And now if you'll excuse us, Lieutenant,
we'd like to go on with our meeting.

1721
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Tell me somethin'.
Is my name Brannigan?

1722
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:19,800
- When last seen.
- Thanks.

1723
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:23,200
I was beginnin' to wonder.

1724
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,000
On behalf of everybody concerned,
thanks, Miss Sarah.

1725
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,600
Also at this time I would like
to personally make a confession.

1726
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:41,400
General,
we did shoot crap here last night,

1727
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:44,600
but unbeknownst to anybody
connected with the mission.

1728
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:47,000
And for this we're all sorry.

1729
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,200
Ain't we, boys?

1730
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:55,100
I'm really sorry.

1731
02:22:56,700 --> 02:23:00,500
I did another terrible thing.
I bet a certain guy that he could not take

1732
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:03,600
a certain doll away with him
on a trip to Havana.

1733
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:08,400
I know this I should not have done,
although it did not do no harm because...

1734
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:10,600
Well, I won the bet.

1735
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:12,900
- You won the bet?
- Sure.

1736
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,800
The guy told me
he did not take the doll away.

1737
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:18,400
And for this I feel much better.

1738
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:25,300
Gentlemen, we will now sing number 244
in your songbook - "Follow the Fold".

1739
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:27,900
You will find it on page 27.

1740
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:38,700
Follow the fold and stray no more

1741
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:42,800
Stray no more, stray no more

1742
02:23:42,900 --> 02:23:47,100
Put down the bottle
and we'll say no more

1743
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:50,500
Follow, follow the fold

1744
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:47,600
Brothers and sisters, as you know,
traffic is heavy this time of night,

1745
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:50,200
so our ceremony will be brief.

1746
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:56,500
Do you, Sarah Brown, take Sky Masterson
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1747
02:26:56,600 --> 02:26:58,300
I do.

1748
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:02,100
Do you, Sky Masterson, take Sarah Brown
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1749
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,300
I do.

1750
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:08,300
Do you, Adelaide, take Nathan Detroit
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1751
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:09,900
I do.

1752
02:27:09,900 --> 02:27:15,100
Do you, Nathan Detroit, take Miss
Adelaide to be your lawful wedded wife?

1753
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:20,000
- He does.
- He's gotta say it.

1754
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:21,700
I do.

1755
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:26,200
Then, under the authority granted me by
the state, county and city of New York,

1756
02:27:26,300 --> 02:27:28,800
I hereby pronounce you men and wives.

1757
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:56,700
<i>When you see a guy
reach for stars in the sky</i>

1758
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:01,000
<i>You can bet that
he's doin' it for some doll</i>

1759
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:05,000
<i>When you spot a John
waiting out in the rain</i>

1760
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:09,000
<i>Chances are he's insane
as only a John can be for a Jane</i>

1761
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:13,500
<i>When you meet a gent
paying all kinds of rent</i>

1762
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:19,000
<i>For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal</i>

1763
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:25,200
<i>Call it sad, call it funny</i>

1764
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:29,500
<i>But it's better than even money</i>

1765
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:32,700
<i>That the guy's only doing it</i>

1766
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:38,700
<i>For some doll</i>
