1
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,161
Holà!

2
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:10,207
Don't tell me.
Ya didn't know it was loaded.

3
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,502
- Sylvie!
- Oh.

4
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,880
Can't he do something constructive,
like start an avalanche or something?

5
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,049
Va jouer, mon chéri.

6
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,637
When you start to eat like this,
something is the matter.

7
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,558
Sylvie, I'm getting a divorce.

8
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,854
- What? From Charles?
- He's the only husband I have.

9
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,818
- I've tried to make it work, really I have, but -
- But what?

10
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,446
I can't explain. It’s just that I'm too miserable
to go on any longer like this.

11
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,619
It is infuriating that your unhappiness
does not turn to fat.

12
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,917
But I don't understand.
Why do you want a divorce?

13
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,878
Because I don't love him.
And he obviously doesn't love me.

14
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,464
That's no reason to get a divorce.

15
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,591
With a rich husband
and this year's clothes...

16
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,469
you won't find it difficult
to make some new friends.

17
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,139
I admit I came to Paris
to escape American provincial...

18
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,225
but that doesn't mean I'm ready
for French traditional.

19
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,936
I loathe the whole idea
of divorce, Sylvie.

20
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,188
But if only Charles had
been honest with me.

21
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,524
That's all I ask of anybody:
the simple truth.

22
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:22,320
But with Charles,
everything is secrecy and lies.

23
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,032
He's hiding something
from me, Sylvie -

24
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,619
something terrible -
and it frightens me.

25
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,621
Does he belong to you?

26
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,416
It’s hers. Where'd you find him?
Robbing a bank?

27
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,626
He was throwing snowballs
at Baron Rothschild.

28
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,921
- Oh, thank you.
- Do we know each other?

29
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,425
- Why? Do you think we're going to?
- I don't know. How would I know?

30
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,677
Because I already know
an awful lot of people.

31
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,638
Until one of them dies
I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

32
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,893
Hmm. Well, if anyone goes
on the critical list, let me know.

33
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,936
- Quitter.
- Uh, what?

34
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,064
You give up awfully easily, don't you?

35
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,902
Viens, Jean-Louis. Let us make a walk.
I've never seen a Rothschild before.

36
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:11,411
Clever fellow. Almost missed me.

37
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,113
Thank you.

38
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:16,743
- You're blocking my view.
- Oh.

39
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,171
- Which view would you prefer?
- The one you're blocking.

40
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,924
It’s my last chance.
I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon.

41
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,426
- What's your name?
- Peter Joshua.

42
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,179
- Mine's Regina Lampert.
- Is there a Mr. Lampert?

43
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,430
- Yes.
- Good for you.

44
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,098
No, it isn't.
I'm getting a divorce.

45
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,310
- Please, not on my account.
- No. I don't really love him.

46
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,939
- At least you're honest.
- Hmm. Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

47
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,316
Yes, but we're divorced.

48
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,693
That wasn't a proposal.
I'm just curious.

49
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,154
Is your husband with you?

50
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,698
Oh, no, Charles is never with me.
What do people call you? Pete?

51
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,201
Mr. Joshua.

52
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,621
- I've enjoyed talking with you.
- Now you're angry.

53
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:58,041
No, I just have a lot of packing to do.
I'm going back to Paris, too.

54
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,086
Wasn't it Shakespeare who said
when strangers do meet in far-off lands...

55
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,129
they should ere long
see each other again?

56
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,341
- Shakespeare never said that.
- How do you know?

57
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,385
It’s terrible.
You just made it up.

58
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,387
Well, it sounds right.
You going to call me?

59
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,764
- Are you in the book?
- Well, Charles is.

60
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,975
- Is there only one Charles Lampert?
- Mmm.

61
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,479
Lord, I hope so.

62
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,076
Good-bye, Sylvie, and thanks.

63
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,579
When you get your divorce,
are you going back to America?

64
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:40,500
- Don't you want me to stay? - Of course,
but if you went back and wrote me a letter -

65
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,253
You could have the stamps.
I'll get you some here, okay?

66
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,298
- Okay.
- Good-bye.

67
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,892
Merci.

68
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,533
Honorine?

69
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,955
Honorine.

70
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,585
- Madame Charles Lampert?
- Yes.

71
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,297
I'm Inspector Edouard Grandpierre
of the police judiciaire.

72
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,925
Would you be so kind
as to come with me, please?

73
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,825
Well, madame?

74
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,829
You are positive?

75
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,500
You loved him?

76
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,837
I'm very cold.

77
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,393
We discovered your husband's body...

78
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:07,063
lying next to the tracks
of the Paris-Bordeaux railroad line.

79
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:10,400
He was dressed only in his pajamas.

80
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:15,113
Do you know of any reason
why he might have wanted to leave France?

81
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,532
Leave? No.

82
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:22,412
Your husband possessed
a ticket of passage on the Maranguape.

83
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,665
It sailed for Venezuela
this morning at 7:00.

84
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,667
I'm very confused.

85
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,254
- He was American, your husband?
- Swiss.

86
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:34,132
Ah, Swiss.
His profession?

87
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,052
- He didn't have one.
- He was a wealthy man?

88
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,054
I suppose so.
I don't know.

89
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,390
- About how wealthy, would you say?
- I don't know.

90
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,601
Where did he keep his money?

91
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,603
I don't know.

92
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,106
Besides yourself,
who is his nearest relative?

93
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:54,944
- I don't know.
- That's absurd, madame. Totalement absurde.

94
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,238
I know. I'm sorry.

95
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,825
- It is all right?
- I wish you wouldn't.

96
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,041
- Les effets de Lampert.
- D'accord.

97
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:13,963
On Wednesday last, your husband sold the entire
contents of the apartment at public auction.

98
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,965
Everything.

99
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,260
The gallery paid him
1,250,000 new francs -

100
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,138
in dollars,
a quarter of a million.

101
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,558
The authorities in Bordeaux searched
his compartment on the train.

102
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,560
They searched it thoroughly.

103
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,522
They did not find $250,000.

104
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,154
These few things are all that was found
in the train compartment.

105
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:42,325
There was no other baggage.
Your husband must have been in a great hurry.

106
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:46,663
One wallet containing 4,000 francs.

107
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,625
One agenda. His last notation was
made yesterday, Thursday -

108
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,503
5:00 p. m., Jardins des Champs-Élysées.

109
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,505
- Why there?
- I don't know.

110
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,176
- Perhaps he met somebody.
- Obviously.

111
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,804
One ticket of passage to South America.

112
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,684
One letter, stamped but unsealed,
addressed to you.

113
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,062
May I see it, please?

114
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,110
"My dear Regina,
I hope you are enjoying your holiday.

115
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,362
"Megève can be so lovely
at this time of year.

116
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,865
"The days pass very slowly,
and I hope to see you soon.

117
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,867
"As always, Charles.

118
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:28,329
P.S. Your dentist called yesterday.
Your appointment has been changed. "

119
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,331
Not much, is it?

120
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,792
We took the liberty
of calling your dentist.

121
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,794
We thought perhaps
we would learn something.

122
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,213
- Did you?
- Yes.

123
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,632
Your appointment has been changed.

124
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,893
One key to your apartment.

125
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,937
One comb.

126
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,023
One fountain pen.

127
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,400
One toothbrush.

128
00:12:57,484 --> 00:13:00,612
One tin of tooth powder.
That is all.

129
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,951
If you will sign this list,
you may take the things with you.

130
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,496
Is that all?
May I leave now?

131
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,166
One more question.

132
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,169
Is this your husband's passport?

133
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,839
Yes.

134
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,925
And this?

135
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,887
I don't understand.

136
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:34,854
And this?

137
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,638
Oh, I telephoned but nobody answered.

138
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,475
- Hello.
- Hello.

139
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,896
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am
and see if there's anything I can do.

140
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,982
How did you find out?

141
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,401
It’s in the afternoon papers.

142
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,321
- I'm very sorry.
- Thank you.

143
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,324
Uh- Uh, I pressed the bell,
but it isn't ringing, I guess.

144
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,285
I know.
There's no electricity.

145
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,706
Well, where did everything go?

146
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,917
Charles sold it all at auction.
This is all I have left.

147
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,756
I love this room, but Charles never really
saw it - only the things in it.

148
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,677
I think I prefer it this way.

149
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,847
What are you going to do?

150
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,434
Try and get my old job back
at EURESCO, I suppose.

151
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:58,313
- Doing what?
- I'm a simultaneous translator, like Sylvie.

152
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,024
Only she's English into French,
and I'm French into English.

153
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,485
That's what I was doing
before I married Charles.

154
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,946
The police probably think I killed him.

155
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,282
Instant divorce, you mean?

156
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,368
Something like that.

157
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,288
It’s terrible it ended this way, though -

158
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,791
tossed off a train
like a sack of third-class mail.

159
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,170
- Well, come on. You can't stay here.
- I don't know where to go.

160
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,630
We'll find you a hotel.

161
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,384
Nothing too expensive.

162
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,553
I'm not a lady of leisure
anymore, you know.

163
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:33,056
Something clean and modest
and near enough to EURESCO...

164
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,224
so you can take a cab when it rains.

165
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,518
- Okay?
- Okay.

166
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:58,247
Not a very large turnout, is it?

167
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,583
Didn't Charles have any friends?

168
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,586
Don't ask me.
I'm only the widow.

169
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,298
If Charles had died in bed,
we wouldn't even have him.

170
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:13,221
At least he knows
how to behave at funerals.

171
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:24,148
Have you no idea
who could have done it?

172
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,486
Until two days ago the only thing
I really knew about Charles was his name.

173
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,197
Now it seems I didn't even know that.

174
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,970
- He must have known Charles pretty well.
- How can you tell?

175
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,055
He's allergic to him.

176
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,770
Bless you.

177
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,982
- Do you know him?
- Never seen him before.

178
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,606
Arrivederci, Charlie.

179
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,448
Miz Lampert, ma'am -

180
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,618
Uh, Miz Lampert, ma'am...

181
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,455
Charlie had no call
of doin' it thataway.

182
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,957
No sirree.

183
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,996
What next?

184
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,962
Mille pardons, madame.

185
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:56,092
- Merci.
- Pardon. Pardon.

186
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,554
Pardon. Pardon.

187
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,765
- Who's it from?
- The American Embassy.

188
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,573
I bluffed the old man out of the last pot
with a pair of deuces.

189
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,575
What's so depressing about that?

190
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,869
Well, if I can do it,
what are the Russians doing to him?

191
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,801
Hello?

192
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:41,679
Is there anything wrong, Miss Tompkins?

193
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,473
Uh, Miss Tompkins isn't here.

194
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,646
Oh, I'm sorry.
My secretary must have gone to lunch.

195
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,317
- Uh, you are -
- Mrs. Lampert. Mrs. Charles Lampert.

196
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:59,196
Oh, yes. Please, uh,
come in, Mrs. Lampert.

197
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,743
Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert.

198
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,579
It’s a stubborn little devil.

199
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,958
Dry cleaning-wise,
things are all fouled up.

200
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:16,380
I had a good man -
a really excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu...

201
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:21,677
but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here
in the building to ease the gold outflow.

202
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,430
Mr. Bartholomew,
are you quite sure you know who I am?

203
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,599
You're Charles Lampert's widow, yes?

204
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,810
I'm very sorry.

205
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,898
Last time I sent out a tie,
only the spot came back.

206
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,194
Voilà, as they say.

207
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,404
Won't you sit down, Mrs. Lampert?

208
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,742
I've got something here.

209
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,538
I've got liverwurst, liverwurst,
chicken and liverwurst.

210
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,707
No, thank you.

211
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:55,503
Mrs. Lampert,
do you know what C.I.A. is?

212
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,922
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?

213
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,718
Central Intelligence Agency. C.I.A.

214
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,804
You mean spies and all of that?

215
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:08,224
- Only we call them agents.
- "We"? You mean you -

216
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,309
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert.

217
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,396
I didn't think people like you
were supposed to admit -

218
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,068
Oh, I'm not an agent.
I'm an administrator, a desk jockey...

219
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:23,614
trying to run a bureau
of overworked men with underallocated...

220
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,574
funds.

221
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,077
Congress seems to think
that all a spy needs -

222
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,872
- Agent.
- Yes.

223
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:37,044
That all he needs is a codebook,
a cyanide pill and he's in business.

224
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,048
What's all this got to do
with me, Mr. Bartholomew?

225
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,218
Your husband was wanted
by the United States government.

226
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,223
May I have a sandwich, please?

227
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:52,518
- Chicken or liverwurst?
- Chicken.

228
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:57,857
To be more specific, Mrs. Lampert,
your husband was wanted by this agency.

229
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,859
- So that was it.
- Yes.

230
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,111
We, of course, knew him
by his real name -

231
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,448
Voss. Charles Voss.

232
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,744
All right, Mrs. Voss.

233
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:14,540
I'd like you to look at this photograph
for a moment, please.

234
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,376
Tell us if you recogni - Oh.

235
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,296
By the way,
have you seen this one?

236
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,674
Scott, Cathy and Ham, Jr.

237
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,469
- Very sweet.
- Aren't they?

238
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,388
- All right, Mrs. Voss -
- Please stop calling me that.

239
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,476
- Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
- I'm terribly sorry.

240
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,730
Mrs. Lampert, would you look at that photograph
and tell me if you recognize anyone?

241
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,566
Just a moment.
Have a good look.

242
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,071
- It's Charles.
- Very good.

243
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:51,452
- He looks so young. When was this taken?
- 1944. Next, please.

244
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,747
The man who was
at the funeral yesterday.

245
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,999
A tall man in a corduroy suit.

246
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:01,754
- Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
- No.

247
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,756
- You like some wine?
- No, thank you.

248
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,258
Next, please.

249
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:10,137
He was there, too.
A little less hair, but it's the same one.

250
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,265
Do you know him, Mrs. Lampert?
Leopold W. Gideon?

251
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,601
- No.
- The last one, please.

252
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,438
That's a face you don't forget.

253
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,399
- He was there, too.
- Herman Scobie.

254
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,111
- You've never seen him before either?
- No, thank heaven.

255
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:31,700
Mrs. Lampert, I'm very much afraid
that you are in a great deal of danger.

256
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,953
Why should I be in any danger?

257
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,872
You're Charles Voss's wife.

258
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,124
Now that he's dead,
you're their only lead.

259
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,878
Mr. Bartholomew,
if you're trying to frighten me...

260
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,214
you're doing a first-rate job.

261
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,800
Please do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert.
It’s your only chance.

262
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,679
Gladly. But I don't know what you want.
You haven't told me.

263
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,640
Oh? I haven't?

264
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,228
Well, it's the money,
Mrs. Lampert, the money.

265
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:03,399
The $250,000 Charles Voss
received from the auction.

266
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,360
Those three men want it, too.
They want it very badly.

267
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,071
But that's Charles's money, not theirs.

268
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:12,449
Oh, Mrs. Lampert, I'd love to see you try
and convince them of that.

269
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:16,203
- Oh, boy.
- But then whose is it? His or theirs?

270
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,081
Ours.

271
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:21,417
Oh.

272
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:25,504
Charles Voss stole $250,000
from the United States government.

273
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,425
- I'm afraid we want it back.
- But I don't have it.

274
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,262
That's impossible, Mrs. Lampert.

275
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,264
You're the only one who could have it.

276
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,475
Mr. Bartholomew,
if I had a quarter of a million dollars...

277
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,519
believe me, I'd know it.

278
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,439
Nevertheless, Mrs. Lampert, you've got it.

279
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,442
You mean it's just lying around somewhere,
all that cash?

280
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:51,322
Or a certified check,
safe-deposit key, baggage claim.

281
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,699
- Look for it. I'm quite sure you'll find it.
- But -

282
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:58,287
Look for it.
Look just as hard and as fast as you can.

283
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,706
You may not have a great deal of time.

284
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,835
Those three men know you've got
the money just as surely as we do.

285
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,212
You won't be safe until
the money's in our hands.

286
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,423
Is that clear?

287
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:13,469
Here's where you're
to call me, day or night.

288
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,930
It’s a direct line to both my office -

289
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,932
and my apartment.

290
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,392
And please don't tell anyone
about coming to see us today.

291
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,770
It could prove fatal
for them as well as yourself.

292
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,106
As I said, Mrs. Lampert,
I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.

293
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,651
I regret very much
having to say this, but...

294
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,987
please remember what happened
to your husband.

295
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,297
- Hello.
- Hello, Peter.

296
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,218
Didn't you telephone me
to meet you on that corner over there?

297
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,470
I'm sorry.
I heard the children laughing.

298
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,767
- Do you understand French?
- Not a word.

299
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,353
I'm still having trouble with English.

300
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,855
The man and the woman are married.

301
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,984
Oh, I can see that.
They're batting each other over the head.

302
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,027
Ay, ay, ay!

303
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,990
Oh là là là! Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

304
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,284
- Who's that with the hat?
- That's the policeman.

305
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,870
He wants to arrest Judy
for killing Punch.

306
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,668
- What's she saying now?
- That she's innocent.

307
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,671
She didn't do it.

308
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,216
- Oh, she did it, all right.
- I believe her.

309
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,471
- Well, who was that?
- That's Punch, of course.

310
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,099
"Punch, of course"?
I thought he was dead.

311
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,227
He's only pretending,
to teach her a lesson.

312
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,816
Only he is dead, Peter.
I saw him. He's not pretending.

313
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,610
Somebody threw him off a train.

314
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:58,032
Charles was mixed up in something terrible.
What am I going to do?

315
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,159
I wish you'd let me help you.

316
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,078
It doesn't sound like the sort of thing
a young woman can handle by herself.

317
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:10,627
How about making me vice president
in charge of cheering you up?

318
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,840
Starting tonight?

319
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,223
Bonsoir, messieurs, dames.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

320
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,184
Buona sera, signore e signori.

321
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:29,480
Ce soir, comme tous les autres soirs
d'ailleurs, vous savez très bien...

322
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,442
qui ici au Black Sheep Club,
I'attraction, c'est vous!

323
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:37,112
Alors, approchez-vous, messieurs, dames.

324
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,364
Venez ici, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

325
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,159
- What's going on?
- Fun and games.

326
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,953
- Evidently we're the floor show. Come on.
- You and me?

327
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,623
Everyone.

328
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,625
Avanti, avanti,
signore e signori.

329
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,086
Ecoutez-moi bien.
Les règles du jeu sont très simple.

330
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,546
Ah, ecoutez-moi.
Alors, il y a deux équipes.

331
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,300
There are two teams,
et pour chaque équipe, il y a une orange.

332
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:02,221
For every team, there is one orange.
Una arancia.

333
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,641
Eine Apfelsine. Vous mettez I'orange
sur le menton comme ça -

334
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,309
put the orange in like so.

335
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:09,144
Vous passez cette orange
a la personne derrière vous -

336
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,146
You pass the orange
to the person behind you...

337
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,357
mais sans servir les mains.

338
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,401
Without the use of your hands.
Are you ready?

339
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,822
Uno, due, tre -

340
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,926
Whoop.

341
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,421
- Mrs. Lampert.
- Who are you?

342
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:02,424
- Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
- Tell me what?

343
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:05,052
It doesn't belong to you.
You do know that, don't you?

344
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,013
- I don't know anyth -
- Mrs. Lampert.

345
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,683
Any morning now you could
wake up dead, Mrs. Lampert.

346
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,769
- Leave me alone.
- Dead, Mrs. Lampert.

347
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,104
Like last week's news.
Like Charles, Mrs. Lampert.

348
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,273
Stop it!

349
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,611
- What's the trouble?
- He stepped on my foot.

350
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,905
- Forgive me.
- Wait here. I won't be long.

351
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,241
It was quite unintentional, I'm sure.

352
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,512
Mr. Bartholomew, this is Regina Lampert.

353
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:53,809
Mr. Bartholomew, I just saw one of those m -
Mr. Bartholomew, can you hear me?

354
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,730
Mr. Bartholomew,
this is Regina Lampert. I just -

355
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,822
- Howdy.
- What do you want?

356
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,534
- You must be kiddin'.
- No, I'm not.

357
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,953
Come on now, Miz Lampert.

358
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,290
You know what it is,
and you're gonna get it for me, too.

359
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,501
'Cause you know
I ain't foolin' around here.

360
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,966
No sirree, Bob.

361
00:31:27,593 --> 00:31:30,846
- Stop that, please!
- Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert.

362
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,100
It could get a whole lot worse, you know.

363
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,981
- It belongs to me, Miz Lampert,
and you're gonna get it for me...

364
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:45,110
or your life ain't gonna be worth
the paper it's printed on.

365
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:48,655
- You "savez" what I'm sayin' to you?
- Stop! Stop! Please stop!

366
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,701
- You go home and think it over real careful like, you hear?
- You're absolutely insane!

367
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:05,047
What's the matter?

368
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,466
What are you doing in here?

369
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:11,094
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

370
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,651
Now hold it. I've waited long enough.
What happened back there?

371
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:31,323
- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
- What does that mean?

372
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:36,161
He said if I told anybody
it could prove fatal for them as well as for me.

373
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,914
- Who said?
- That's what I'm not supposed to say.

374
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,666
Eh -

375
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:46,129
- Now stop that nonsense.
- Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.

376
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,424
- I'm not bullying you.
- Yes, you were. You said it was nonsense.

377
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,636
Being murdered in cold blood
is not nonsense.

378
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,180
Why don't you try it sometime?

379
00:32:56,974 --> 00:33:00,435
- Would you mind seeing me to the door?
- Of course not.

380
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,439
It’s a good place for making friends.

381
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:11,196
You said this afternoon your husband
was mixed up in something.

382
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,281
How do you shave in there?

383
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,283
What was it?

384
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,537
- What was what?
- What your husband was mixed up in.

385
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,373
Look, I know it's asking you
to stretch your imagination, but...

386
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,459
don't you think you could pretend
just for a moment that I'm a woman?

387
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:28,588
I could already be arrested for transporting
a minor above the first floor.

388
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,301
- Here you are.
- Where?

389
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,638
- On the street where you live.
- How about once more around the park?

390
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:39,391
How about getting out of here?
Come on, child. Out.

391
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,729
- Won't you come in for a minute?
- No, I won't.

392
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:50,444
I don't bite, you know,
unless it's called for.

393
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:54,489
- How would you like a spanking?
- How'd you like a punch in the nose?

394
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:59,494
- Stop treating me like a child.
- Well then, stop behaving like one.

395
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,621
If you want to tell me
what's troubling you, fine.

396
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,249
If not, I'm tired,
it's late and I want to go home to bed.

397
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,252
Oh -

398
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,546
Do you know what's wrong with you?

399
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,090
No. What?

400
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,092
Nothing.

401
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,522
Where is it, lady?

402
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,524
I don't know.

403
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:39,784
I want it.

404
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,454
You give it to me.

405
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,373
It’s mine!

406
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,628
Peter! Peter!

407
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,422
- A man tried to kill me!
- What?

408
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,326
Peter?

409
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,579
Peter, are you all right?

410
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:28,208
Oh, Peter. Are you hurt?

411
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,585
Mm-hmm.
I sprained my pride.

412
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,837
How are you?

413
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,924
- Scared.
- You'll be all right.

414
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,511
- Where did he go?
- Out the window, I guess.

415
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,556
Lock the door,
and don't let anyone in except me.

416
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,226
- And close these windows after me.
- Be careful.

417
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,478
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

418
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,504
Alistair!

419
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,216
- What is it now, Pamela?
- It happened again.

420
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:22,762
Another strange man peered
in the window at me but then went away.

421
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,931
Bad luck, Pamela.

422
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,496
- That was a dumb move,Herman.
- Oh, man. And then some.

423
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,957
If you'd let us known
you was goin' to her room...

424
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,959
we could have done somethin'
to keep him busy.

425
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,504
But sneakin' up thataway by yourself.

426
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,965
What did you expect him to do?

427
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:04,012
- Walk up and shake you by that hand of yours?
- A dumb move, Herman. A dumb move.

428
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,682
Yes, it was a dumb move,Herman.
What is the matter with you?

429
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,936
- You want some more?
- Never mind that. Did you get the money?

430
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:16,274
How could I with the three Marx Brothers
breathing down my neck?

431
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,943
I thought we had an agreement.

432
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,489
Now, the girl trusts me.

433
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,867
If she's got the money, I'll find out about it.
But you just leave me alone.

434
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:31,039
We took all the chances.
The money belongs to us, not to him.

435
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,376
Now, don't be piggy, Herman.

436
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,213
A third of nothing is nothing.
Just think about that.

437
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,675
But make up your mind.
She's waiting for me.

438
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,803
I don't see how another 24 hours
could hurt anything.

439
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,055
Shoot, no.
Not after all these years.

440
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,934
Then he gets it out of your share.

441
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:57,774
Not mine.

442
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,486
Either one of you
got the room next to her?

443
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,488
Yeah, I have. Why?

444
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,366
Give me the key.
Get another room. I want to use it.

445
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,451
Hmm.

446
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,835
If you do find that money...

447
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,921
you ain't gonna forget
to tell your buddies about it, are ya?

448
00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:24,300
- Don't worry.
- Oh, no, I ain't worryin'.

449
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,803
You see this little fella here?

450
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,556
Oh, he worries.

451
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,850
And he's even meaner than I am.

452
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,375
- Who is it?
- It’s me, Peter.

453
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,187
There was no trace of him.

454
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:22,442
Why don't you confide in me
and tell me what this is all about?

455
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,988
There are three men.
He's one of them.

456
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:30,575
They think I have a quarter of a million
dollars that belongs to them.

457
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,164
- Go on.
- That's all.

458
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,834
- No, it isn't. Where's the money?
- I don't know.

459
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:44,172
They killed Charles to get it,
but he must not have had it with him on the train.

460
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,674
- So they think he left it with you.
- But he didn't.

461
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,011
I've looked everywhere,
and if I don't find it they're going to kill me.

462
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,015
No, they won't.
I won't let them.

463
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,228
Peter, help me.
You're the only one I can trust.

464
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,232
I'll help you.

465
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,359
I told you I would. Come on.

466
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,821
Oh, I'm so hungry I could faint.

467
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,448
And I've gotten your suit all wet.

468
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,536
That's all right. It’s a drip-dry.

469
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,038
Wipe your eyes.

470
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,042
Promise me you'll never lie to me
the way Charles did.

471
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:23,920
Why do people have to tell lies?

472
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:28,675
Usually it's because they want something.
They're afraid the truth won't get it.

473
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,970
Do you tell lies?

474
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,064
- Hello?
- Mrs. Lampert, it's me...

475
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:45,984
the man who was in your room
a few minutes ago.

476
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,571
- What do you want?
- Who is it?

477
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,865
It’s the man you had the fight with.

478
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,034
- Is Dyle with you?
- Who?

479
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,581
The man I had the fight with, lady.
Dyle. That's his name.

480
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,292
What's wrong?
Is he still there?

481
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:11,426
- Yes, that's right.
- What's he saying?

482
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,597
Don't trust him.
Don't tell him anything.

483
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,891
He's after the money.

484
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,026
What was all that about?

485
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,446
He -

486
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,575
- He said if I don't give him the money he'll kill me.
- Oh, don't take it seriously.

487
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,662
He's just trying to frighten you.

488
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,082
- I believe what he said.
- No, no. It’s just a lot of words.

489
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,501
Words can hurt.

490
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,462
I know.

491
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,506
Try to get some sleep.
You'll feel better.

492
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:55,136
Don't worry. I've arranged
to take the room next door to you.

493
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,390
So you'll be all right.

494
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,809
If you want anything,
just bang on the wall.

495
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,479
Better lock the door after me.

496
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,315
Good night.

497
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,013
But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew.
What I'm trying to say is that -

498
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,974
is that there's someone else.

499
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,102
- What?
- Someone who wasn't in that photograph you showed me today.

500
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:47,605
He says his name is Peter Joshua,
but it isn't. It’s Dyle.

501
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,944
- Are you still there, Mr. Bartholomew?
- Yes, yes, Mrs. Lampert.

502
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,905
Uh, I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is...

503
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,033
but it's possible we were wrong
about who killed your husband.

504
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,328
You mean... he might have?

505
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,873
Mr. Bartholomew,
I'm catching the next plane out of here.

506
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:09,043
I'm not going to sit around for somebody
to make chopped liver out of me.

507
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,422
Now, take it easy, Mrs. Lampert.
Take it easy.

508
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,425
Uh, where are you now?
Can you meet me at the market?

509
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,511
- At Les Halles?
- Yes. Opposite Saint-Eustache.

510
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:22,306
- I'll meet you there in 15 minutes.
- All right. I'll be there in 15 minutes.

511
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,523
Allez vite, n'importe où.
N'importe où! Vite!

512
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,367
Suivez ce taxi.

513
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,919
- Were you followed?
- Yes, by Dyle. But I lost him.

514
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,463
I'm beginning to think
women make the best spies.

515
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,465
Agents.

516
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,676
- He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew.
- No.

517
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,971
- But I saw it.
- No, that's not Carson Dyle.

518
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,642
- Carson?
- There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert.

519
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,644
That's Carson Dyle.

520
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,896
You mean you've known
about him all along?

521
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,608
It’s enough to make you
a vegetarian, isn't it?

522
00:44:56,568 --> 00:45:00,530
It’s just lucky I'm not hanging
next to one of those things right now.

523
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,492
Why didn't you tell me
you knew about Dyle?

524
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,744
I didn't see any point.
Dyle's dead.

525
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,249
Mr. Bartholomew,
what is all this about?

526
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:16,295
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -

527
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,673
the military espionage unit -

528
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,925
were ordered behind the German lines...

529
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:26,430
for the purpose of delivering
$250,000 in gold...

530
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,975
to the French underground.

531
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,435
The five men were, of course,
your husband Charles...

532
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,188
the three men who showed up
at his funeral yesterday...

533
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,566
and Carson Dyle.

534
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:40,903
- Oh.
- But instead of delivering the gold, they stole it.

535
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,447
- How?
- By burying it...

536
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,325
then reporting
the Germans had captured it.

537
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,703
All they had to do was
come back after the war...

538
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,372
dig it up and split it five ways.

539
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:55,835
Quarter of a million dollars
with no questions asked.

540
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,212
May I have a cigarette, please?

541
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,382
I can't stand those things.

542
00:46:01,466 --> 00:46:04,385
It’s like drinking coffee through a veil.

543
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:08,681
Everything went smoothly enough
until after the gold was buried.

544
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:12,977
Before they could get out,
they were ambushed by a German patrol.

545
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:16,480
A machine gun separated
Scobie from his right hand...

546
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,567
and caught Carson Dyle
full in the stomach.

547
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,406
What was wrong with that one?

548
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,326
Nothing, I guess.
What happened then?

549
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,455
- Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
- Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew.

550
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,498
What happened then?

551
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:42,089
Carson Dyle was dead,
but Scobie was able to travel. So -

552
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,134
- La soupe, c'est pour qui?
- Pour moi.

553
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,604
Where was I?

554
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,106
- Carson Dyle was dead.
- Yes. Carson Dyle was dead.

555
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,318
The others finally got back to the base
and waited for the war to end...

556
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,238
only Charles couldn't wait
quite as long as the others.

557
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:09,075
He beat them back to the gold,
took everything for himself and disappeared.

558
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,954
It’s taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time
to catch up with him again.

559
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,958
But if they stole all that money,
why can't you arrest them?

560
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,418
Shh.

561
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:23,547
We know what happened from the bits and pieces
we were able to paste together...

562
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,841
but we still have no proof.

563
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,552
What's this got to do with the C.I.O.?

564
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,518
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert.

565
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,980
It’s an extension of the wartime O.S.S.

566
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,107
It’s our money, and we want it back.

567
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,986
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew,
but nothing you've said has changed my mind.

568
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,196
I'm leaving Paris tonight.

569
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,908
Wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.

570
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,328
Better consider what happened
to your husband when he tried to leave.

571
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,081
Those men won't be very far away
no matter where you go.

572
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,042
In fact, I don't even see any point
in your changing hotels.

573
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,837
Now, please help us, Mrs. Lampert.

574
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,506
Your government is counting on you.

575
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,012
Well, if I'm going to die,
I might as well do it for my country.

576
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,348
That's the spirit.
Here's what I want you to do.

577
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,019
We're anxious to know who this man is -
the one calling himself Dyle.

578
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,979
I want you to find out.

579
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,356
Why me?

580
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,109
You're in an ideal position.
He trusts you.

581
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:30,656
Besides, you yourself said
women make the best spies.

582
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,367
Agents.

583
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,131
Oh, pardon.

584
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,908
- Fräulein. Fräulein.
- What are you doing following me?

585
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,995
It’s gonna look like a parade. Stop it.

586
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,670
How are you? Nice to see you.
When did you arrive?

587
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,924
It’s a lovely town. Are you having a good time?
So many things to see.

588
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,723
Fräulein.

589
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,725
Fräulein!

590
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,520
If you don't stop following me,
I'll call the police.

591
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,440
Taxi!

592
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,674
Dyle, please. D-Y-L-E.

593
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,759
Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

594
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,643
- No, I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle. Nothing today.
- Thank you.

595
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:25,980
Mr. Dyle, please.
You're wanted on the telephone.

596
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,107
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four.

597
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,526
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four, please.

598
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,996
- Yes?
- Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

599
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,500
- Reggie?
- It’s the only name I've got. How about you?

600
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,086
No cat and mouse. You've got me.
What do you want to know?

601
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,338
Why you lied to me.

602
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,425
I had to. For all I knew,
you were in on the whole thing.

603
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:58,179
- I'm trying to find out who you are.
- You know my name. It’s Dyle.

604
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,181
Carson Dyle is dead.

605
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,641
Yes, he is.
He was my brother.

606
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,020
Your brother?

607
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:09,190
The army thinks he was
killed in action by the Germans...

608
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:13,360
but I think they did it -
Tex, Gideon, Scobie and your husband -

609
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,864
because my brother wouldn't
go along with their scheme to steal the gold.

610
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,200
I think he threatened
to turn them in and they killed him.

611
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:24,330
I'm trying to prove it. They think
I'm working with them, but I'm not, Reggie.

612
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,540
I'm on your side.
Just believe that.

613
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,585
How can I? You lied to me
just the way Charles did.

614
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,587
After promising you wouldn't.

615
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,215
Oh, I want to believe you, Peter -

616
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,217
I can't call you that anymore, can I?

617
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:40,262
Take me a while to get used to
your new name. What is it?

618
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,307
Hmm? Hello?

619
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:46,810
Hello?

620
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,743
Do anything funny or try to
talk to anyone and I'll kill you, Dyle.

621
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:05,037
You'll wreck your raincoat.

622
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,040
Take the next car, please.

623
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,978
Look out.
Didn't want you to bump your head.

624
00:52:30,855 --> 00:52:33,524
All right, get in there.

625
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,202
All right, turn around.

626
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,547
Now sit down.

627
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:11,353
- Now what?
- We wait. With our mouth shut.

628
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,239
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

629
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,211
Okay. Up there.

630
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:48,182
- Do I knock or something?
- No, open it...

631
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,726
and keep right on goin'.

632
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,354
The view had better be worth it.

633
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,495
Very pretty. Now what?

634
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,625
I was afraid of that.

635
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:23,467
I'll give you a chance, Dyle,
which is more than you'd give me.

636
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,512
Where's the money?

637
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,850
Is that why you dragged me all the way
up here? To ask me that?

638
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,063
- She has it.
- And I say maybe you both have it.

639
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:40,609
One more time, Dyle.
Where is it?

640
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:45,072
Supposing I had it -
which I don't -

641
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:48,492
do you really think
I'd just hand it over to you?

642
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,372
Step back.

643
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,252
Back where?

644
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,046
That's the idea.

645
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:06,009
Hmm. Now - Now, just a minute.
Take it easy.

646
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:55,244
- Herman?
- What?

647
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:01,041
- How you doing?
- How do you think?

648
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:06,088
If you get bored, try writing "Love thy neighbor"
100 times on the side of the building.

649
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:21,895
Monsieur, next time, please,
use the keyhole, hmm?

650
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,993
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

651
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:40,789
- You gonna open up?
- Sure. Wait a minute.

652
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:45,127
Don't you know it's impolite
to leave someone holding... the phone?

653
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,129
What happened?

654
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,631
Oh, I met a man with sharp nails.

655
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,802
- Scobie?
- Mm-hmm.

656
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:57,598
I left him hanging around
the American Express.

657
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,601
Come in. I've got something
that stings like crazy.

658
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:03,604
You're the kind of girl
that'd have something like that.

659
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,606
Sit down.

660
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,608
Uh, w-w-wait a minute.

661
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,610
- W-W-What is that stuff?
- Marvelous stuff.

662
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,613
- Gonna hurt you much more than
it's gonna hurt me. - I'll bet -

663
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,115
Oh! Did you hear something rip?

664
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:17,743
- No.
- Oh. That's odd.

665
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,748
Listen, I-I only came in for an estimate.

666
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,250
Sit still. It’s not too bad.

667
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,170
You won't be able to
lie on your back for a few days.

668
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:31,173
- But then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
- Oh-ho-ho -

669
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,175
- Ooh!
- Does it hurt?

670
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,177
- What?
- Does it hurt?

671
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,179
Oh. Are you kidding?

672
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:40,140
Have you got a bullet I could bite,
like they do in the movies?

673
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:43,101
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

674
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,562
Would you like to see my passport?

675
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,190
Passport?
What kind of a proof is that?

676
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,443
- Well, would you like to see where I was tattooed?
- Yes.

677
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:53,946
All right.
We'll drive around that way.

678
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,952
You could at least tell me
what your first name is these days.

679
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,788
Alexander.

680
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,790
Okay, Alexander.

681
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,792
- You're done.
- Good.

682
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,294
You're a new man.

683
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,297
I'm sorry the old one
couldn't tell you the truth...

684
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,842
but I had to find out
your part in all this.

685
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,844
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

686
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,846
Yes.

687
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,307
But we're divorced.

688
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,518
I thought that was Peter Joshua.

689
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,479
I'm just as difficult
to live with as he was.

690
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:31,733
Alex, how can you tell
if anyone's lying or not?

691
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,278
- You can't.
- There must be some way.

692
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,281
There's an old riddle about
two tribes of Indians.

693
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,410
The Whitefeet always tell the truth,
and the Blackfeet always lie.

694
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,412
One day you meet an Indian.
You say...

695
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:47,416
"Hey, Indian, what are you,
a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot?"

696
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,585
He says, "I'm a truthful Whitefoot. "
But which is he?

697
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,465
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?

698
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,342
Because he's wearing moccasins.

699
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,845
Well, then, he's a truthful Whitefoot,
of course.

700
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,596
Why not a lying Blackfoot?

701
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,768
- Which one are you?
- A truthful Whitefoot.

702
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,564
Come in.

703
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:13,066
- Sit down.
- Why? Do you wanna look at my feet?

704
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,360
Yes.

705
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:20,365
Uh-oh. Ohh. Hey, knock it off.
Come on, Reggie. Listen to me.

706
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,367
Here it comes, the fatherly talk.

707
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,579
- You forget I'm already a widow.
- So was Juliet, at 15.

708
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:28,915
- But I'm not 15.
- Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me.

709
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,252
- Can't you be serious?
- Oh! You just said an horrible word.

710
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:34,755
- What did I say?
- Serious.

711
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:38,300
When I man gets to be my age,
that's the last word he ever wants to hear.

712
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:42,345
I don't want to be serious,
and I especially don't want you to be.

713
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:46,850
Okay, we'll just sit around all day long
being frivolous. How about that, hmm?

714
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,394
Reggie, cut it out.

715
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,397
Okay.

716
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,941
- Now what are you doing?
- Cutting it out.

717
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,360
- Who told you to do that?
- You did.

718
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,529
I'm not through complaining yet.

719
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,531
Oh.

720
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:07,704
- Now cut it out.
- Alex, I think I love you.

721
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,294
Hey, the telephone's ringing.

722
01:01:14,378 --> 01:01:16,296
Never mind.

723
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,299
Whoever it is won't give up,
and neither will I.

724
01:01:19,383 --> 01:01:21,301
Just a minute.
Go on, take it.

725
01:01:23,387 --> 01:01:25,847
Hello.

726
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:29,101
I'm sorry, uh -
I was just, uh -

727
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,103
nibbling on something.

728
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,105
Say, I'd appreciate it mighty highly...

729
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:37,109
if you'd, uh, wiggle on over to Room 46
and chew the fat for a spell.

730
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,444
Could you give me
one good reason why I should?

731
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:44,116
Yeah. A little one, about six or seven.

732
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,409
Keeps callin' for Aunt Reggie.

733
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,121
Ain't that cute?

734
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,581
They've got Jean-Louis.

735
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,418
I'll be right there.

736
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,758
Hey, Tex, do somethin' with this kid, will ya?
My leg's goin' to sleep.

737
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,427
Upsy-daisy.

738
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,429
Are you a real cowboy?

739
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,431
Yeah, sure I am, kid.

740
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,433
So where's your gun?

741
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,523
Will you put that thing away!

742
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,525
Jean-Louis.

743
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,610
Howdy, Miz Lampert.

744
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,613
Who invited him?

745
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,032
Well,Herman, I see
you had a happy landing.

746
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,034
I must call Sylvie right away.

747
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,037
- I'm afraid that'll have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
- It’s his mother.

748
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:34,291
She won't be anybody's mother
unless you answer some questions.

749
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:37,460
- This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
- We want that money now.

750
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:40,881
Why don't you keep quiet and
stop threatening the child.

751
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:44,593
He hasn't got the money,
and neither has Mrs. Lampert.

752
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:45,969
Then who does?

753
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:49,055
I don't know, Herman.
Maybe you do.

754
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,849
Me?

755
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,768
- Or you.
- Ohh.

756
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:57,063
- Or him.
- Why, that's the most ridiculous thing I ever -

757
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,066
- Listen to this man.
- Man's gone loco.

758
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:04,863
Now hold it. Suppose one of you
found Charles here in Paris.

759
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,865
Even bumped into him by accident...

760
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,493
followed him when he tried to run out again,
cornered him on the train...

761
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,455
threw him out the window and,
without bothering to tell the other two...

762
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,498
took all the money for yourself.

763
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:19,044
If one of us did that, he wouldn't hang around
waiting for the other two to figure it out.

764
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:23,006
But he'd have to. Don't you see?
If he left, he'd be admitting his guilt.

765
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:26,051
Whoever it is has to wait here
pretending to look for the money...

766
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:29,262
waiting for the rest of us
to give up and go home.

767
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:32,599
He's just tryin' to throw us off.
They got it, I tell ya.

768
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,101
Why don't we search their rooms?

769
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,104
That's all right with us.

770
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:41,608
Then what are we wastin' time for?
Let's go.

771
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:44,527
- While we're waiting, we'll search yours.
- Not my room.

772
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:48,573
Well, Herman.
You have something to hide?

773
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,953
Then there are no objections.

774
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,955
All right, here's my key.

775
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,707
- I'll take that.
- My room's open.

776
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,709
Everyone. Whoa.
Come on.

777
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,881
Now, you two
just make yourselves to home here.

778
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:08,635
Well, let's get busy.

779
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,138
Come on, Jean-Louis.
Come along. Oh, that's fine.

780
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:15,141
- Who gets your vote?
- Scobie. He's the one who objected.

781
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,144
All right,
I'll take Tex's room here and Gideon's.

782
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,314
You take Jean-Louis with you,
and bolt the door from inside.

783
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,067
Come on, Jean-Louis.
We'll have a treasure hunt.

784
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,613
Tex?

785
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,159
Man, that's Charlie's stuff.

786
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,161
Looks like it.

787
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,664
- Think we ought to call Herman?
- What for?

788
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:40,667
If it's not here,
why bother him?

789
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,794
And if it is?

790
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:44,921
Why bother him?

791
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,844
Oh.

792
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:53,847
- What?
- Sure there's nothing missing here?

793
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:58,059
No, everything's here.
The police have kindly provided us with a list.

794
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:02,522
Sure ain't nothin' here
worth no quarter of a million dollars.

795
01:05:02,606 --> 01:05:04,524
Not unless we're blind.

796
01:05:04,608 --> 01:05:07,861
I keep telling myself
we've stolen a great deal of money...

797
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:10,864
but up to now I've yet
to see a penny of it.

798
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,950
You think maybe we're fishin'
up the wrong stream?

799
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,203
Meaning what?

800
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:21,082
Suppose one of us has it.
You know, like the man says.

801
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,376
Now, that'd be mighty distasteful...

802
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,379
us bein' veterans
of the same war and all.

803
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:31,217
Well, you know I'd tell you if I had it.

804
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,429
Oh, naturally.
Just like I'd tell you if I had it.

805
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,431
Naturally.

806
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,767
And that goes for Herman, too.

807
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,977
Naturally.

808
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:47,317
He's all right, Sylvie. Honestly.

809
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:50,487
Just hurry over as soon as you can.
Okay. Good-bye.

810
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:55,909
Now, if you had a treasure,
where would you hide it?

811
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:59,079
I would bury it in the garden.

812
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,082
Swell, but this man
doesn't have a garden.

813
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,584
- Oh, neither do I.
- You don't?

814
01:06:04,668 --> 01:06:08,755
Well, if you had to hide it in this room,
where would you put it?

815
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:11,591
- Up there.
- On top of that cupboard?

816
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:15,178
You know something?
You may be right.

817
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:22,894
Oh, I hope I don't find
any hairy little things living up here.

818
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:26,648
Hey, there is something.
And it's heavy.

819
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,109
I found it!
I found it! I found it!

820
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:32,445
If you think you're getting credit for this,
you're crazy.

821
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,614
We won!
We won! We won!

822
01:06:34,698 --> 01:06:37,826
We won! We won!
We won! We won!

823
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:41,287
We found it!
We found it!

824
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,289
- Did you find it?
- No.

825
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,292
- What do you mean, no?
- The kid was yellin'.

826
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,753
Up there.
It’s up there.

827
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,548
Believe me,
there's nothing up there.

828
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,550
Yeah?

829
01:06:56,011 --> 01:06:57,929
Oh!

830
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,902
Oh! Jumpin' frijoles.

831
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,737
It’s Herman's spare.

832
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:20,869
- Where is he?
- He's over in my room.

833
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,431
You'd better take the boy
out in the hall.

834
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:53,485
Oh, now, who would've done
a mean thing like that?

835
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,988
I'm not quite sure.

836
01:07:57,072 --> 01:07:59,199
Well, this ain't my room.

837
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,242
Mine neither.

838
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,537
Oh, the police aren't going to like this a bit.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

839
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:08,625
We could dry him off and take him
down the hall to his own room.

840
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:11,085
He really doesn't look too bad.

841
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,213
Oh, poor old Herman.

842
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:17,467
Seems like him and good luck
always was strangers.

843
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:21,471
Well, maybe now he'll meet up with
his other hand someplace.

844
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,315
A man drowned in his bed?

845
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,317
Impossible.

846
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,945
And in his pajamas -
the second one in his pajamas.

847
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,988
C'est trop stupide.

848
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,949
Stop lying to me.

849
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,993
This nose tells me when you are lying.

850
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:47,288
It is never mistaken,
not in 23 years.

851
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:50,416
This nose will make me
commissaire of police.

852
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:54,546
Mr. Dyle, or Mr. Joshua -
Which is it?

853
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,548
Dyle.

854
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,842
And yet you registered
in Megève as Mr. Joshua.

855
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:03,846
Didn't you know it was against the law
to register under an assumed name?

856
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:07,892
- No, I didn't.
- It’s done in America all the time.

857
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,229
None of you will be
permitted to leave Paris...

858
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,398
until this matter is cleared up.

859
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,985
Only I warn you,
I will be watching.

860
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:21,114
We use the guillotine in this country.

861
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,659
I have always suspected
that the blade coming down...

862
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:28,204
causes no more than
a slight tickling sensation...

863
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,707
on the back of the neck.

864
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,709
It is only a guess, of course.

865
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:36,045
I hope none of you ever
finds out for certain.

866
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,929
Who do you think did it?

867
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:48,141
- Gideon?
- Possibly.

868
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,810
- Or Tex?
- Possibly.

869
01:09:50,894 --> 01:09:52,812
- You're a fat lot of help.
- That's right.

870
01:09:52,896 --> 01:09:54,814
- Can I have one of those?
- One of what?

871
01:09:54,898 --> 01:09:56,816
- I think Tex did it.
- Oh.

872
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,819
- Vanille et chocolat, s'il vous plait.
- Why do you think Tex did it?

873
01:09:59,903 --> 01:10:01,821
Because I really suspect Gideon...

874
01:10:01,905 --> 01:10:04,365
and it's always the person
you don't suspect.

875
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,910
Do women think it feminine to be so illogical,
or can't they help it?

876
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,912
What's so illogical about that?

877
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,915
You just said it's always
the one you don't suspect.

878
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,335
You suspect Gideon,
therefore it must be Tex.

879
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:19,547
On the other hand, if you suspect Tex
it must be the other fella, Gideon.

880
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,758
- I guess they just can't help it.
- Hmm?

881
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,760
- Who?
- Women.

882
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:25,762
Oh.

883
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:28,598
You know, I can't help
feeling rather sorry for Scobie.

884
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,101
Wouldn't it be nice
if we were like that?

885
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,103
- What, like Scobie?
- No. Gene Kelly.

886
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:37,106
Remember when he danced down here
by the river in An American in Paris...

887
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,108
without a care in the world?

888
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:42,028
- Hmm.
- You know, this is good. Want some?

889
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:44,989
- Uh -
- Oh!

890
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,991
No, thanks.

891
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:50,703
I guess you don't either. Here, give me that.

892
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,830
I'm sorry.

893
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,792
Alex, I'm scared.

894
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:57,919
Yes, I know.

895
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,838
I can't think of any reason
why he was killed.

896
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:04,133
Well, perhaps someone thought
that four shares were too many.

897
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,887
What makes you think that this someone
is going to be satisfied with three?

898
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:12,725
- He wants it all. That means we're in his way, too.
- That's right.

899
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:17,021
We've got to do something. I mean,
any minute now we could be assassinated.

900
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,023
Would you do anything like that?

901
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,776
What, assassinate someone?

902
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,570
No. Swing down from there
on a rope to save the woman you love.

903
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,614
Like the hunchback of Notre Dame.

904
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,574
Uh - Huh?

905
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,619
Who put that there?

906
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:38,876
- Hurry up and change. I'm starved.
- Let me know what you want to eat...

907
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,920
so I can pick out a suit that matches.

908
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:43,005
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

909
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,141
Uh-uh.

910
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:54,600
What do you want?

911
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,854
It’s the house detective.
Why don't you have a girl in there?

912
01:11:57,938 --> 01:11:59,856
God, you're a pest.

913
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,317
- Can I come in?
- No. I'm going to take a bath.

914
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:06,279
Wouldn't it be better
if you did it in here?

915
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:09,782
- What for?
- Well, I wouldn't want to use that tub.

916
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,869
Anyway, I don't want to be alone.
I'm afraid.

917
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:15,204
You're only next door.
If anything happens, holler.

918
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:23,671
Reggie?

919
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,590
Got you. Ha, ha.

920
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,510
Did you ever hear the story
of the boy who cried wolf?

921
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,846
The shower's in there.

922
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:35,475
- Oh, come on, open the door.
- This is a ludicrous situation.

923
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:38,978
I can think of a dozen men
who are just longing to use my shower.

924
01:12:39,062 --> 01:12:42,440
- Why don't you call one of them?
- I dare you.

925
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,942
Oh, you're a nut.

926
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:50,490
- What are you doing?
- Taking off my shoes.

927
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:53,993
Did you ever hear of anyone
taking a shower with their shoes on?

928
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,999
I usually sing a medley of old favorites
when I'm in the shower.

929
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:02,919
- Any requests?
- Shut the door.

930
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:07,131
I'm afraid I don't know that one, miss.
Well -

931
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,258
- Shut the door.
- Why?

932
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,260
Come in and watch.

933
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:25,274
Drip-dry.

934
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,195
How often do you go through
this little ritual?

935
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,989
Oh, every day.
The manufacturer recommends it.

936
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,908
I don't believe it.

937
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:36,285
Oh, yes, it's -
Wait a minute.

938
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:39,831
Here's the label.

939
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,833
Look at the small print.

940
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:45,127
"Wearing this suit during washing...

941
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,588
helps protect its shape. "

942
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,219
Whoo!

943
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,181
Waterproof.

944
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:03,646
Wait.

945
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,440
Acro-nylon.
Fibrous resistant.

946
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:10,444
Plastic. Rustproof. Fireproof. Proof-proof.

947
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,446
- You're the nut.
- Nut-proof.

948
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:21,205
- Yes?
- Mrs. Lampert? Bartholomew.

949
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,374
I spoke to Washington, Mrs. Lampert.

950
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,960
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew.
I'm listening.

951
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:30,715
Well, I told them what you said
about this man being Carson Dyle's brother.

952
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,968
I asked them what they knew about it,
and they told me.

953
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:36,220
You're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert.

954
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,890
Carson Dyle had no brother.

955
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,728
- Mrs. Lampert?
- Are you sure there's no mistake?

956
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:47,148
None whatsoever.
Please be careful, Mrs. Lampert.

957
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:49,150
Bye.

958
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:01,078
I left all my drip-dry dripping.
Is that all right?

959
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,205
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

960
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,292
You're probably weak from hunger.

961
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:08,294
You've only eaten five times today.

962
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:12,173
I'll get someone to fix up my suit quickly
and take you out to dinner.

963
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:14,884
Let's go somewhere crowded.
I feel like a lot of people.

964
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,730
Hey, you know, this thing is still damp.

965
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,904
You haven't spoken a word for 20 minutes.

966
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:38,199
I was thinking about Charles and Scobie
and who's going to be next.

967
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,201
Me?

968
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:43,204
I don't suppose you know
who the murderer is, do you?

969
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:45,206
No. Not yet.

970
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:49,710
Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty much
have sewn up the nomination, don't you think?

971
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:53,172
What are you trying to say,
that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?

972
01:15:53,256 --> 01:15:56,133
What do I have to do to satisfy you?
Become the next victim?

973
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,136
- It’s a start, anyway.
- Oh.

974
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,138
I can't understand you at all.

975
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,349
One minute you're chasing me
around the shower room.

976
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:05,434
The next minute you're
accusing me of murder.

977
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,813
Carson Dyle had no brother.

978
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,903
Oh, I can explain that,
if you'll just listen.

979
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,407
Well, I can't very well leave
without a pair of water wings, can I?

980
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:23,035
- All right, get set for the story of my life.
- Fiction or nonfiction?

981
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,414
- Eh - Why don't you shut up?
- Well!

982
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:29,208
- Are you going to listen?
- Go on.

983
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:31,210
All right.

984
01:16:31,294 --> 01:16:35,715
Now, when I was a young man,
my father expected me to go into his business.

985
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:38,718
Umbrella frames.
That's what he made.

986
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:42,888
A sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't
have the sense in those days to be sensible.

987
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:45,474
I suppose all this is leading somewhere.

988
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,728
Well, it led me away from umbrella frames,
for one thing.

989
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:51,731
But that left me without
any honest means of support.

990
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,733
What do you mean?

991
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:55,735
Well, in this highly competitive world...

992
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:59,071
when a man has no profession,
there isn't much choice...

993
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:02,742
so I began looking for people
who had more money than they needed...

994
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,952
including some they'd barely miss.

995
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,121
You mean you're a thief?

996
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:10,583
Well, that's not exactly
the term I'd have chosen...

997
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:14,378
but it sort of captures
the spirit of the thing.

998
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,673
I don't believe it.

999
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,301
I can't really blame you now.

1000
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:23,262
But I do believe it.
That's what I don't believe.

1001
01:17:23,346 --> 01:17:26,682
So it's good-bye, Alexander Dyle,
welcome home, Peter Joshua.

1002
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,935
Sorry. The name's Adam Canfield.

1003
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,606
- Adam Canfield?
- Mm-hmm.

1004
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:37,651
Wonderful. Do you realize you've had
three names in the past two days?

1005
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,404
I don't even know
who I'm talking to anymore.

1006
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,699
- Well, the man's the same, even if the name isn't.
- No, he isn't.

1007
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:47,036
- Adam Canfield is a crook, and I want to know why.
- Well, it's simple.

1008
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,538
I like what I do. I enjoy my work.

1009
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,291
There aren't many men
who love their work as much as I do.

1010
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:54,794
You look around sometime.

1011
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:57,379
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

1012
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,133
- Yes, but we're divorced.
- "But we're divorced. "

1013
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:04,637
- That's right. Now go and eat your dinner.
- Oh, I could eat a horse.

1014
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:06,639
I think that's what you ordered.

1015
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:10,142
Don't you dare be civil with me
after leading me on like this.

1016
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:13,646
- How did I lead you on?
- Oh, all that marvelous rejection.

1017
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,648
You knew I couldn't resist it.

1018
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:18,901
- Now it turns out all you're interested in is the money.
- That's right.

1019
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:21,904
- Oh.
- Well, what would you like me to say?

1020
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:25,324
That a pretty girl with an outrageous manner
means more to an old pro like me...

1021
01:18:25,408 --> 01:18:27,326
than a quarter of a million dollars?

1022
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:30,955
- I don't suppose so.
- It’s a toss-up, I can tell you that.

1023
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,207
Hmm.

1024
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,668
- What?
- Hasn't it occurred to you...

1025
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,796
that I'm having a tough time
keeping my hands off you?

1026
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:46,804
- Oh, you should see your face.
- What's the matter with it?

1027
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,556
It’s lovely.

1028
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,558
Ohh.

1029
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,270
Now what's the trouble?

1030
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:57,565
I'm not hungry anymore.
Isn't it glorious?

1031
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,569
- Adam!
- It’s all right. Come and look.

1032
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:22,464
You don't look so bad in this light.

1033
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:24,967
Why do you think I brought you here?

1034
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:27,386
Maybe you wanted me
to see the kind of work...

1035
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:29,388
the competition was turning out.

1036
01:19:29,472 --> 01:19:31,390
Pretty good, huh?

1037
01:19:31,474 --> 01:19:34,393
I taught them everything they do.

1038
01:19:34,477 --> 01:19:38,689
Oh, did they do that kind of thing
way back in your day?

1039
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:41,692
Sure. How do you think I got here?

1040
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,909
- Not allowed to kiss back, huh?
- Oh, no.

1041
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:53,012
Doctor said it was bad
for my thermostat.

1042
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,387
Well, when you come on,
you come on, don't you?

1043
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,681
Well, come on.

1044
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,408
Yeah.

1045
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,078
Hmm?

1046
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:36,080
In the lobby?

1047
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:43,921
Are you out of your mind or something?
It’s 3:30 in the morning.

1048
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,591
You mean it?

1049
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:53,555
All right. All right, I'll be right down.
Wait a minute.

1050
01:21:31,811 --> 01:21:34,179
Hey, turn on the lights!

1051
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:44,273
Hey, how do you stop this thing?

1052
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:07,212
Three of them, all in their pajamas?
C'est ridicule.

1053
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,715
What is it, some new American fad?

1054
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:13,469
And now your friend who lives here,
uh, the one from Texas...

1055
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:15,721
he has disappeared into thin air.

1056
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,599
- Where is he?
- I wish I knew.

1057
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,809
Madame?

1058
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:26,273
Tell me, Mr. Dyle.
Where were you at 3:30 a. m.?

1059
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,734
In my room, asleep.

1060
01:22:28,818 --> 01:22:31,153
- And you, Mrs. Lampert?
- I was, too.

1061
01:22:31,237 --> 01:22:33,489
In Mr. Dyle's room?

1062
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:35,491
No, in my room.

1063
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:39,078
Obviously you're telling the truth...

1064
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:42,414
for why would you invent
such a ridiculous story?

1065
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:47,378
And if I were you,
I wouldn't stay in my pajamas.

1066
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,463
Good night.

1067
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:54,259
Well, that wraps it up.
Tex has the money.

1068
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:58,305
- Go to bed. I'll let you know when I've found him.
- You're gonna go looking for him now?

1069
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:02,142
If the police find him first, they're not going to
turn over that quarter of a million to us.

1070
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:05,020
- Oh, Adam -
- Go to bed and bolt your door.

1071
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,239
- Yeah?
- Now you listen to me, Dyle.

1072
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:18,617
I know who's got that money, man,
and I want my share.

1073
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:23,372
Seems to be growin' and growin' every day.
Well, I ain't disappearin' till I get it.

1074
01:23:23,456 --> 01:23:25,791
- Where are you, Tex?
- Come on, man.

1075
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:29,420
Look, my mama didn't raise
no stupid children.

1076
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,422
I'll tell you what.

1077
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,424
You wanna find me...

1078
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,426
you just look over your shoulder...

1079
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,429
'cause from now on
I'm gonna be right behind you.

1080
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:50,732
Open up.

1081
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:59,408
- I think I was wrong about Tex having the money.
- Why?

1082
01:23:59,492 --> 01:24:01,910
I just heard from him.
He's still hungry.

1083
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:05,080
That means killing Gideon
didn't get it for him.

1084
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:08,667
So he's narrowed it down to us.
You've got it.

1085
01:24:08,751 --> 01:24:11,211
But I've looked everywhere.
You know I have.

1086
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,172
Where's the airlines bag?

1087
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:15,799
- In the wardrobe.
- Get it.

1088
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,801
Lord, you're obstinate.

1089
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,971
Charles must have had it with him
on the train when Tex killed him.

1090
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:22,973
Thanks.

1091
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,478
Everybody and his Aunt Lillian's
been through that bag...

1092
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,480
including me.

1093
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:32,483
- Okay, we'll do it again.
- I've been into it at least once a day.

1094
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,485
Somebody would have seen it.

1095
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:39,865
It’s there, Reggie.
We're looking at it right now.

1096
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:42,534
Something on that bed is worth
a quarter of a million dollars.

1097
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:46,121
- But what?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1098
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,582
Four passports. No.

1099
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:52,628
Steamship ticket.

1100
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:56,423
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.

1101
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,342
Wallet.

1102
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,845
Comb? No.

1103
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,848
A fountain pen.

1104
01:25:07,977 --> 01:25:09,895
What about that key?

1105
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:11,897
To the apartment.
Matches mine exactly.

1106
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:13,941
Oh.

1107
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,861
I bet you don't
really need those.

1108
01:25:19,155 --> 01:25:21,156
You need them.

1109
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:28,997
This still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth
a quarter of a million dollars either.

1110
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,252
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1111
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:35,546
- The tooth powder.
- What about it?

1112
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,382
Could you recognize heroin
just by the taste of it?

1113
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,181
Heroin.

1114
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,392
- Peppermint-flavored heroin.
- Hmm.

1115
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,937
Well, I guess that's it.

1116
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:53,939
Dead end.

1117
01:25:54,023 --> 01:25:57,442
Well, go to bed.
You've gotta go to work in the morning.

1118
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:59,903
There's nothing more we can do tonight.

1119
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:02,239
I love you, Adam.

1120
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,659
Yes, you told me.

1121
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:09,329
No. The last time I said,
"I love you, Alex. "

1122
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:13,542
Oh.

1123
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:27,848
- Hold it. They're recognizing Great Britain.
- Oh, la vache.

1124
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:30,058
Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates...

1125
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,728
and my distinguished colleague from Italy.

1126
01:26:32,812 --> 01:26:37,024
Her Majesty's delegation has listened with
great patience to the Southern European -

1127
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:39,484
- Oh, are you on?
- No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?

1128
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,486
Nothing. I think I've found something.

1129
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:44,489
I was snooping around Tex's room
and came across this in the wastebasket.

1130
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:46,491
I stuck it together again.

1131
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:48,994
That's the receipt Grandpierre gave me
for Charles's things.

1132
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:51,496
- I don't see how that's going to -
- You're not looking.

1133
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:55,167
When we went through the airlines bag,
something was missing - "un agenda. "

1134
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:59,004
That's an appointment book, isn't it?
It wasn't there.

1135
01:26:59,088 --> 01:27:01,006
That's right.

1136
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:03,008
I remember Grandpierre
looking through it...

1137
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:05,886
but there was nothing in it
the police thought was very important.

1138
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,013
Can you remember anything in it at all?

1139
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:11,516
Well, it did say something
about Charles's last appointment.

1140
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,518
With whom? Where?

1141
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,521
- I think it only said where.
- Come on, Reggie, think.

1142
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:18,523
This may be what we're looking for.

1143
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:21,526
Adam, that money doesn't belong to us.

1144
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:24,529
- If we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
- Nonsense. We didn't steal it.

1145
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:27,366
- There's no law against stealing stolen money.
- Of course there is.

1146
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:28,659
- There is?
- Yes.

1147
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:30,952
When did they pass such a silly law?
Think, Reggie.

1148
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:34,873
- What was in that appointment book?
- Oh, it was a place or street corner or something.

1149
01:27:34,957 --> 01:27:36,875
Watch it. I'm on.

1150
01:27:50,264 --> 01:27:53,850
Of - Of the Western
Hemisphere conference -

1151
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:57,562
Of the Western hemisphere conference...

1152
01:27:57,647 --> 01:27:59,564
held on March 22-

1153
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:02,442
No, wait!
It was last Thursday, 5:00...

1154
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,861
the Jardins des Champs-Élysées.

1155
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,863
That's it, Adam! The gardens!

1156
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,200
Well, it's Thursday today,
and it's almost 5:00, so come on.

1157
01:28:11,285 --> 01:28:13,203
It’s all right, gentlemen. Carry on.

1158
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,333
Now what?

1159
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:21,253
5:00, Thursday, the gardens.

1160
01:28:21,337 --> 01:28:23,255
Must be something around here.

1161
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:25,257
Charles's appointment was last week.

1162
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:28,552
- Yes, I know, but this is all we've got left.
- You're not kidding.

1163
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:31,054
Ten minutes ago I had a job.

1164
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:34,057
Now you've got another job,
so stop grumbling and start looking.

1165
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:37,060
I'll take that side.
You poke around over here.

1166
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:19,144
It’s hopeless.
I don't even know what we're looking for.

1167
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:21,521
I don't think Tex does either.

1168
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:24,232
- Tex? Is he here?
- Look.

1169
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:32,491
I'm going to see what he's up to.
You stay here.

1170
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:35,535
Be careful, Adam.
He's already killed three men.

1171
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,187
Wait! Wait!

1172
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,189
Taxi!

1173
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,191
Look out.

1174
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:08,128
All right, where's the letter?

1175
01:31:09,171 --> 01:31:12,757
The letter, huh?
It ain't worth nothin'.

1176
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,760
You know what I mean.
The envelope with the stamps on it.

1177
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:17,762
I want it.

1178
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:20,724
You greenhorn.

1179
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:25,395
Why, you thick-skulled, harebrained,
half-witted greenhorn.

1180
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:28,315
And they was both too smart for us.

1181
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,152
- What are you talking about?
- First her husband, now her.

1182
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:34,446
She batted all of them big eyes at you...

1183
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:39,117
and you fell for it like an egg
from a tall chicken.

1184
01:31:39,201 --> 01:31:41,453
You want the envelope?

1185
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:44,831
There. You take it. It’s all yours.

1186
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:51,171
You killed all three of 'em for nothin'!

1187
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:55,300
You greenhorn!

1188
01:31:55,384 --> 01:31:58,386
You block-headed jackass!

1189
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:00,889
You nincompoop!

1190
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,977
Sylvie!
What are you doing here?

1191
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:08,313
I'm waiting for Jean-Louis.

1192
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:10,315
Oh. What's he up to?

1193
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:13,610
He was so excited when he got the stamps
you gave him this morning.

1194
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:16,571
- He said he'd never seen any like them.
- I'm glad.

1195
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:18,573
- What's all this?
- The stamp market.

1196
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:20,617
It’s there every Thursday afternoon.

1197
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:23,036
That's where Jean-Louis trades his stamps.

1198
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:26,998
- Good Lord, where is he?
- What's the matter, chérie?

1199
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,334
The stamps!
They're worth a fortune!

1200
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:32,128
- What?
- A fortune! Come on!

1201
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:42,430
- Oh, I don't see him anywhere.
- We'll separate.

1202
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:44,599
- You look over there.
- Okay.

1203
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:54,484
Jean-Louis.

1204
01:32:54,568 --> 01:32:57,028
Jean-Louis!

1205
01:33:04,453 --> 01:33:08,331
Jean-Louis.

1206
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,334
Reggie. Reggie.

1207
01:33:14,296 --> 01:33:17,215
Jean-Louis, thank heaven.
Do you have the -

1208
01:33:18,592 --> 01:33:22,470
- What's this?
- A man gave me all those for only three.

1209
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:26,266
A man? Oh, no, Jean-Louis.
Who? Where?

1210
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:31,146
Vite, mon chéri. Vite.

1211
01:33:32,356 --> 01:33:33,982
- Là-bas.
- Come on.

1212
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:40,947
- Oh, but he's gone.
- I don't blame him.

1213
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,450
Entrez.

1214
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:47,287
- Monsieur Felix?
- Oui.

1215
01:33:49,331 --> 01:33:52,500
I was expecting you.
I knew you would come.

1216
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:54,502
Look at them, madame.

1217
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:58,298
Have you ever, in your entire life,
seen anything so beautifuI?

1218
01:33:58,382 --> 01:34:01,301
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything about stamps.

1219
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:05,680
I know them as one knows his own face,
though I had never seen them.

1220
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:08,099
This one, a Swedish four shilling...

1221
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,226
called Den Gula Fyraskillingen...

1222
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:12,270
printed in 1854.

1223
01:34:12,354 --> 01:34:15,607
- What is it worth?
- Oh, the money is unimportant.

1224
01:34:15,691 --> 01:34:17,859
I'm afraid it's very important.

1225
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:21,196
Well, in your money, perhaps $85,000.

1226
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,240
- May I sit down?
- Yes.

1227
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:27,452
- And the blue one?
- Oh, it's called The Hawaiian Blue.

1228
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:30,663
In 1894, the owner was murdered
by a rival collector...

1229
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:32,665
who was obsessed to own it.

1230
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,709
And what is its value today?

1231
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:37,378
65,000.

1232
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:41,007
- And the last one.
- Ah, the best for last.

1233
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:44,552
Le chef-d'œuvre de la collection.
The masterpiece.

1234
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:47,388
The most valuable stamp
in the world.

1235
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:49,432
It’s called
the Gazette Moldave.

1236
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:54,395
It was printed by hand on colored paper
and marked with the initials of the printer.

1237
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:59,109
Today it has a value
of $100,000.

1238
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,694
I'm not a thief, madame.

1239
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:03,738
I knew there was some mistake.

1240
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:10,703
You gave the boy a great
many stamps in return.

1241
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:12,705
- Are they for sale now?
- Let me see.

1242
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,291
350 European, 200 Asian...

1243
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:18,294
175 American, 100 African...

1244
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:21,297
and 12 Princess Grace commemorative...

1245
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:23,299
which comes to 10 francs.

1246
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:27,929
And don't forget these.

1247
01:35:28,013 --> 01:35:30,181
Thank you.

1248
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:32,142
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

1249
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:36,437
For a few minutes they were mine.
That is enough.

1250
01:35:40,943 --> 01:35:43,903
Adam? Adam?

1251
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,740
- Hello?
- Mr. Bartholomew?

1252
01:36:28,824 --> 01:36:30,742
Yes.

1253
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:32,911
Tex is dead. Smothered.

1254
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:39,626
And Adam did it. He killed them all.

1255
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:43,379
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1256
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:46,758
Tex wrote the word "Dyle"
before he died.

1257
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:51,262
He's the murderer, I tell you.

1258
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:55,016
Wait a minute, Mrs. Lampert.
You'd better give that to me again.

1259
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,311
It was the stamps on the letter
Charles had with him on the train.

1260
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:02,106
They were in plain view all the time,
but no one bothered to look at the envelope.

1261
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:05,443
Mrs. Lampert, listen to me.
You're not safe as long as you have these stamps.

1262
01:37:05,527 --> 01:37:09,239
Let's see. Do you know the center garden
at the Palais Royale?

1263
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:11,824
- Yes. The colonnade?
- Yes, by the colonnade.

1264
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:16,871
- As fast as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
- I'm leaving right away. Good-bye.

1265
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:33,721
Reggie! The stamps!
Where are they? Reggie! Wait!

1266
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:37,016
So you can kill me, too? Tex is dead.
He wrote "Dyle" on the carpet.

1267
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:40,561
- I'm not Dyle. You know that.
- But Tex didn't know it. You're a murderer.

1268
01:37:40,646 --> 01:37:42,563
Reggie, I want those stamps!

1269
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:45,608
- Palais Royale, vite.
- Je suis occupé.

1270
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,860
- Mais c'est très urgent.
- Occupé.

1271
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:25,815
Whoa!
Billet, monsieur.

1272
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:29,772
Oh!

1273
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:54,422
American Embassy.

1274
01:40:54,506 --> 01:40:56,966
A- American Embassy?

1275
01:40:57,050 --> 01:41:01,012
Uh, Mr. Bartholomew's office, please.

1276
01:41:01,096 --> 01:41:05,016
- Would you speak a little louder, please?
- I can't speak any louder.

1277
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,560
Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew.

1278
01:41:07,644 --> 01:41:10,062
I'm sorry.
Mr. Bartholomew has left for the day.

1279
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:13,983
But someone's trying to kill me.

1280
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:16,486
- What?
- Kill me!

1281
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,988
You've got to get word
to him right away.

1282
01:41:19,072 --> 01:41:22,700
He's in the center garden
of the Palais Royale near the colonnade.

1283
01:41:22,784 --> 01:41:26,037
Tell him I'm trapped in a phone booth
right below him in the metro station.

1284
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:28,080
The name's Lampert.

1285
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:14,377
- Hello?
- Hello. Mr. Bartholomew?

1286
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:17,630
- Yes.
- There was a call for you just now, Mr. Bartholomew.

1287
01:42:17,714 --> 01:42:20,216
It sounded quite urgent.
A Mrs. Lampert.

1288
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:23,386
Lampert? I don't know any Mrs. Lampert.

1289
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:27,223
She says she's trapped in a metro station
and someone's trying to kill her.

1290
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:32,270
Trying to kill her?
Who does she think I am, the C.I.A.?

1291
01:42:32,354 --> 01:42:35,231
All right, I guess you'd better call
the French police.

1292
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:30,244
Mr. Bartholomew!
Mr. Bartholomew!

1293
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:32,246
- Help me!
- Reggie, stop.

1294
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:35,249
That man is Carson Dyle.

1295
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:40,129
We all know Carson Dyle
is dead, Mrs. Lampert.

1296
01:43:40,213 --> 01:43:43,341
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.
- Now, you're not gonna believe him.

1297
01:43:43,425 --> 01:43:46,260
Bring those stamps over here.
He's trying to trick you again.

1298
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:50,264
Tex recognized him. That's why he wrote Dyle.

1299
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:53,643
- If you take him those stamps, he'll kill you, too.
- Mrs. Lampert...

1300
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:57,772
if I'm who he says I am,
what's preventing me from killing you right now?

1301
01:43:57,856 --> 01:44:01,525
Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps,
and he knows he'd never make it.

1302
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:04,528
Mrs. Lampert,
he wants the money for himself.

1303
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:06,614
That's all he's ever wanted.

1304
01:44:06,698 --> 01:44:10,451
- He's with the C.I.A. I saw him at the embassy.
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.

1305
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:12,828
That's right, Mrs. Lampert.
That's right.

1306
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:14,955
I'm a dead man. Look at me.

1307
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:21,003
Oh, I don't know who anybody is.

1308
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:23,381
Reggie, I beg you.

1309
01:44:23,465 --> 01:44:25,383
Just trust me once more.

1310
01:44:25,467 --> 01:44:27,635
Why should I?

1311
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:30,971
I can't think of a reason
in the world why you should.

1312
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:39,480
Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert,
or I'll kill you.

1313
01:44:39,564 --> 01:44:42,733
It won't get you the stamps, Dyle.
You'll have to come out to get them...

1314
01:44:42,818 --> 01:44:44,944
and I'm not likely to miss at this range.

1315
01:44:45,028 --> 01:44:47,738
Maybe not, but it takes
a lot of bullets to kill me.

1316
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:50,950
They left me there with five of them
in my legs and my stomach.

1317
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:53,744
Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was alive,
but they left me there.

1318
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:56,706
I spent 10 months in a German prison camp
with nothing to stop the pain.

1319
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:59,417
They left me there, Mrs. Lampert.
They deserved to die.

1320
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:03,254
- But I had nothing to do with it.
- You've got the money now. It belongs to me.

1321
01:45:03,338 --> 01:45:07,049
Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was still alive,
but they left me there.

1322
01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:10,386
That's why I had to kill them,
all four of them.

1323
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:13,848
Please believe me. I’ll kill you, too.
It won't make any difference.

1324
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,769
It’s no use.
You're running out of time.

1325
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:22,356
I've come too far to turn back.
I swear, I’ll kill you.

1326
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:27,278
Make up your mind, Mrs. Lampert. Now.

1327
01:45:27,362 --> 01:45:29,029
Adam!

1328
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:52,840
All right.

1329
01:47:52,924 --> 01:47:56,010
I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert.
Come on out.

1330
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:15,613
Do you hear me? Come on out.

1331
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:31,378
I don't want to kill you, but I will.

1332
01:48:36,217 --> 01:48:37,968
Come on out.

1333
01:49:14,464 --> 01:49:16,882
The game is over, Mrs. Lampert.

1334
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:52,835
You didn't have to chase me so hard.

1335
01:49:52,919 --> 01:49:55,838
- That one's done. Do this one.
- Oh.

1336
01:49:55,922 --> 01:49:58,841
I'm sorry I thought
you were the murderer...

1337
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:02,344
but how was I to know
he was as big a liar as you are?

1338
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:05,347
Is that all the gratitude I get
for saving your hide?

1339
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:10,019
- Rub your own blinking foot.
- The truth now. Was it my hide, or those stamps?

1340
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:13,022
What a terrible thing to say.
How could you think that?

1341
01:50:13,106 --> 01:50:15,024
Then prove it to me.

1342
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:19,028
Tell me to go to the embassy first thing
in the morning and turn in those stamps.

1343
01:50:20,905 --> 01:50:24,742
- I said, tell me to go to the embassy first -
- I heard you, I heard you.

1344
01:50:24,826 --> 01:50:26,744
Then say it.

1345
01:50:26,828 --> 01:50:29,955
Now, Reggie, listen to me.

1346
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:33,250
- There's something I'd like to explain.
- Never mind. I'll go by myself.

1347
01:50:33,334 --> 01:50:36,420
What makes you think they're even interested?
It’s only a quarter million.

1348
01:50:36,504 --> 01:50:39,840
It'll cost more than that for them
to fix their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer -

1349
01:50:39,924 --> 01:50:42,217
Who's a taxpayer?
Crooks don't pay taxes.

1350
01:50:42,969 --> 01:50:44,887
- Excuse me, soldier -
- Marine, ma'am.

1351
01:50:44,971 --> 01:50:49,224
Forgive me. Who would I see regarding
the return of stolen government money?

1352
01:50:49,309 --> 01:50:51,226
You might try the Treasury Department.

1353
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:53,437
Room 217, second floor, Mr. Cruikshank.

1354
01:50:53,521 --> 01:50:55,856
217. Thank you, marine.

1355
01:51:01,946 --> 01:51:04,865
Uh - Uh, do you mind
if I don't go in with you?

1356
01:51:04,949 --> 01:51:08,869
The sight of all that money being given away
might make me break out.

1357
01:51:11,206 --> 01:51:14,124
Mr. Cruikshank, please.
My name is Lampert.

1358
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:16,126
Yes.

1359
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:19,129
- Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss Lamp -
- Mrs.

1360
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:21,340
Mrs. Lampert to see you.

1361
01:51:21,424 --> 01:51:23,717
- Yes, sir. Go right in.
- Thank you.

1362
01:51:34,187 --> 01:51:37,606
Of all the mean...

1363
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:39,608
rotten...

1364
01:51:39,692 --> 01:51:42,444
contemptible, crooked -

1365
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:45,864
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad
to find out I'm not crooked.

1366
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:48,325
You can't even be honest
about being dishonest.

1367
01:51:48,409 --> 01:51:50,327
Why didn't you say something?

1368
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:54,081
- We're not allowed to tell. Come on, give me the stamps.
- Hmm.

1369
01:51:55,583 --> 01:51:59,169
Wait a minute. How did Carson Dyle
get an office in this building anyway?

1370
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:02,506
- When did you meet him? What time of day, I mean.
- About 1:00.

1371
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:06,009
The lunch hour.
Probably worked it out in advance.

1372
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:09,429
Found an office usually left open
and moved in for the time you were here.

1373
01:52:09,514 --> 01:52:13,142
Then how do I know this is your office?

1374
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:17,896
Mrs. Foster, take a memo to Bartholomew
in Security recommending -

1375
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:20,232
Bartholomew.

1376
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:23,193
Recommending that embassy offices
be kept locked during the lunch hour.

1377
01:52:23,278 --> 01:52:25,696
Mmm. Starting with his own.

1378
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,657
- Give me the stamps. Come on.
- What's your first name today?

1379
01:52:28,741 --> 01:52:31,076
- Brian.
- Brian Cruikshank.

1380
01:52:31,161 --> 01:52:33,662
Serves me right
if I get stuck with that one.

1381
01:52:33,746 --> 01:52:36,623
- Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
- Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

1382
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:38,625
- Yes.
- But we're divorced.

1383
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:40,586
No.

1384
01:52:41,629 --> 01:52:43,589
Oh.

1385
01:52:45,383 --> 01:52:47,134
My mother. She lives in Detroit.

1386
01:52:47,218 --> 01:52:50,512
You'd like her. She'd like you, too.
Come on, give me those stamps.

1387
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:53,807
Not until you prove to me
that you're really Brian Cruikshank.

1388
01:52:53,892 --> 01:52:57,227
One day next week I'll put it
on a marriage license. How about that?

1389
01:52:57,312 --> 01:52:59,229
Quit stalling.
I want some identification now.

1390
01:52:59,314 --> 01:53:03,192
- I wouldn't lie on a license.
- You can't prove it. You're still trying to -

1391
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:05,694
"Marriage license"?

1392
01:53:05,778 --> 01:53:08,155
Did you say "marriage license"?

1393
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:11,200
Don't change the subject.
Just give me the stamps.

1394
01:53:11,284 --> 01:53:15,871
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian,
whatever your name is.

1395
01:53:15,955 --> 01:53:17,873
Oh, I love you.

1396
01:53:17,957 --> 01:53:19,875
I hope we have a lot of boys.

1397
01:53:19,959 --> 01:53:21,877
We can name them all after you.

1398
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:24,880
Well, before we start that,
may I have the stamps?
