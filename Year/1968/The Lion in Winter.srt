1
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,375
Come for me!

2
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:28,333
You're gaining on it, Johnny.

3
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,333
Am I, father? Am I really?

4
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,375
Off you go now.
Run along and practice.

5
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:07,292
He'll make a good king.
He'll be ready.

6
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,292
That's the way.
Come on, my son!

7
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,292
Have you found religion,
Henry?

8
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:19,333
Will you look down from heaven and
see who's sitting on your throne?

9
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,292
I must know before I die.

10
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:27,333
There's a legend of a king called
Lear, with whom I have a lot in common.

11
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,333
Both of us have kingdoms
and three children we adore,

12
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,292
and both of us are old,
but there it ends.

13
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,292
He cuts his kingdom into bits.
I can't do that.

14
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,333
I've built an empire, and
I must know it's going to last.

15
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,292
All of Britain,
half of France...

16
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:45,292
I'm the greatest power in a thousand
years, and after me comes John.

17
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,250
I'm going to lose you,
Henry, aren't I?

18
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,208
Alais, in my time I've known...

19
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,250
contessas, milkmaids,
courtesans...

20
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:05,250
and novices,
whores, gypsies, jades...

21
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:08,208
and little boys,

22
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,250
but nowhere in God's western world
have I found anyone to love but you.

23
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,208
And Rosamund?

24
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,750
- She's dead.
- And Eleanor.

25
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:23,250
The new Medusa,
my good wife?

26
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,250
How is your queen?
Decaying, I suppose.

27
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,292
No, don't be jealous
of the Gorgon.

28
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,250
She is not
among the things I love.

29
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,250
How many husbands do you know
who dungeon up their wives?

30
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:43,250
I haven't kept the great bitch in the keep
for ten years out of passionate attachment.

31
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:48,250
- There's Captain Marshal.
William!

32
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,708
We will be holding
Christmas court at chinon.

33
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,167
We have asked the king of France
to join us.

34
00:05:55,208 --> 00:06:00,208
I want Richard there and Geoffrey.
Go find my boys and tell them.

35
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,208
Then go fetch the queen
from Salisbury tower.

36
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,167
If the queen refuses?
Eleanor?

37
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,208
She wouldn't miss this
for the world.

38
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:12,125
Richard.

39
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,125
Richard!

40
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:24,125
Hello, Richard.

41
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,083
Forward!

42
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:15,375
Forward!

43
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,542
Geoffrey?

44
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,542
Geoffrey.

45
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,000
Geoffrey!

46
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,042
Father wants to see me.

47
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,042
Your majesty.

48
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,042
There's to be
a Christmas court.

49
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,125
Yes, madam.

50
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:51,083
Where?
At chinon.

51
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,250
Henry, what if, just for once,
I didn't do as I was told?

52
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:01,917
It's going to be
a jungle of a day.

53
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,250
If I start growling now,
I'll never last.

54
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,292
You'll last.

55
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:09,917
You're like the rocks at
stonehenge... nothing knocks you down.

56
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:19,333
In these rooms, Alais, on this
Christmas, I have all the enemies I need.

57
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:23,333
You have more than you think.
Are you one?

58
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,375
Has my willow
turned to poison oak?

59
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,917
If I decided to be trouble,
Henry, how much trouble could I be?

60
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,375
Not much.

61
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,667
I could give away your plans.
You don't know what they are.

62
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,417
I know you want to disinherit
Richard. So does Eleanor.

63
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,375
She knows young Henry's dead.

64
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,417
The young king died in summer, and I haven't
named an heir. She knows I want John...

65
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,958
on the throne, and I know she wants
Richard... we are very frank about it.

66
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,875
Henry, I can't be your mistress
if I'm married to your son.

67
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,875
Why can't you?
Johnny wouldn't mind.

68
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,625
I do not like your Johnny.
He's a good boy.

69
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,750
He's got pimples,
and he smells of compost.

70
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,875
He's just 16!
He can't help the pimples.

71
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:03,417
He could have a bath!

72
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,458
It isn't such a dreadful thing
to be queen of England.

73
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,458
Not all eyes will weep for you.

74
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,167
Will yours?
I don't know.

75
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,833
Very likely.

76
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,667
All I want is not to lose you.
Can't you hide me?

77
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,458
Can't I simply disappear?
You know you can't.

78
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Your little brother Philip's king of France now,
and he wants your wedding or your dowry back.

79
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:29,833
I only took you for your
dowry. You were seven...

80
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:34,875
two big knees and two big eyes,
and that's all.

81
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,875
How was I to know?

82
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:44,875
Hey. What's the matter, lad? Nothing.

83
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:09,542
- Geoff!
- Johnny!

84
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,583
Is that for me?
I love Christmas.

85
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,792
What difference does
my dowry make?

86
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,625
Let Philip have it back.
It isn't much. I can't.

87
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:29,667
The vexin is a little county,
but it's vital to me. And I'm not.

88
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,833
It's been my luck to fall
in love with landed women.

89
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,792
When I married Eleanor
I thought, "you lucky man.

90
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,708
"The richest woman in the
world... she owns the Aquitaine,

91
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,708
the greatest province in the
continent, and beautiful as well."

92
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,708
She was, you know.
And you adored her.

93
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:52,667
Memory fails. There may
have been an era when I did.

94
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,750
Let's have one strand askew. Nothing
in life has any business being perfect.

95
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,708
If I say you and I are done,
we're done.

96
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,750
If I say marry John,
it's John.

97
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,708
I'll have you by me,

98
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,708
and I'll use you as I like.

99
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,750
Ah, Christmas...
warm and rosy time.

100
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:31,292
The hot wine steams,
the yule log roars,

101
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,750
and we're the fat
that's in the fire.

102
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,750
She'll be here soon,
you know. Who? Mother.

103
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,792
She still want you to be king? We
are not as friendly as we used to be.

104
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,750
If I'm supposed to make a fuss
and kiss her hairy cheek, I won't.

105
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,750
What you kiss,
little prince, is up to you.

106
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,750
I'm father's favorite.
That's what counts.

107
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:52,750
You hardly know me, Johnny, so I
beg you to believe my reputation.

108
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:56,708
I am a constant soldier, a
sometime poet, and I will be king.

109
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,708
Just you remember...
father loves me best.

110
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,708
Why John? John doesn't
care for you at all.

111
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,708
We love each other deeply. None
of them has any love for you.

112
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,667
Because we fight?

113
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:14,708
Tell me all three want the crown. I'll
tell you it's a feeble prince that doesn't.

114
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,708
They may snap at me and plot, and that
makes them the kind of sons I want.

115
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,667
I've snapped and plotted
all my life.

116
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:26,708
There's no other way to be a
king, alive and 50 all at once.

117
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,708
I'm going to fight for you.
Oh, fine.

118
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:43,583
How was your crossing?
Did the channel part for you?

119
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,583
It went flat when I told it to.

120
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,542
I didn't think to ask for more.

121
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:02,583
How dear of you to let me out of
jail. It's only for the holidays.

122
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:08,542
Like school, you keep me young.
Here's gentle Alais.

123
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:13,542
No,
greet me as you used to.

124
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,625
Fragile I am not.

125
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,542
Affection is a pressure
I can bear.

126
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:25,542
Oh, but I do have
handsome children.

127
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,500
John, you're so clean and neat.

128
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:32,500
Henry takes good care of you.
And Richard.

129
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,708
Don't look sullen, dear. It makes
your eyes go small and piggy...

130
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,750
and your chin look weak.

131
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:41,500
Geoffrey.

132
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,542
Is Philip here yet?
Not yet.

133
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,542
Let's hope he's
grown up like his father...

134
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,750
Simon pure and Simon simple...
good, good, Louis.

135
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:52,542
If I had managed sons for him
instead of all those little girls,

136
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,792
I'd still be stuck
with being queen of France,

137
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,500
and we should not have
known each other.

138
00:19:57,542 --> 00:20:00,833
Such, my angels,
is the role of sex in history.

139
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,542
Thatwill be Philip.

140
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,833
Where's Henry?
Upstairs with the family whore.

141
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,542
That's a mean and tawdry way
to talk about your fiancee.

142
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,833
My fiancee.
Whosever fiancee.

143
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,375
I brought her up, and she
is dear to me and gentle.

144
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,833
He still plans to make John
king. Of course he does.

145
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:25,500
My, what a greedy little trinity
you are... king, king, king.

146
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:28,542
Two of you must learn to live with
disappointment. Ah, but which two?

147
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,875
Let's deny them all
and live forever.

148
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:33,917
Tusk to tusk
through all eternity.

149
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,542
Ah, my boys.

150
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,958
The king of France and I will
shortly have a tactile conversation,

151
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,917
like two surgeons
looking for a lump.

152
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,542
We'll state positions, and I'll make the first
of many offers. He'll refuse it, naturally.

153
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,500
I'll make a better one, and so on
through the holidays until I win.

154
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:54,500
For the duration of this joyous ritual
you will give to your father your support.

155
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
- My lord!
- Your grace!

156
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:51,042
Welcome to chinon.

157
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,417
Ah, that's better.

158
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:11,417
I was told you were impressive
for a boy of 17.

159
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:15,125
- I'm Eleanor, who might have been your mother.
- queen Eleanor.

160
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,417
All the others here you know.

161
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,417
I gather you're disturbed
about your sister and her dowry.

162
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:23,417
Sixteen years ago
you made a treaty with us.

163
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,417
- It is time its terms were executed.
- I should think so.

164
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:29,167
Our position comes to this:

165
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,708
That you will either hold the
marriage or return the vexin.

166
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,208
Alais marries Richard, or we'll
have the county back at once.

167
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,458
That's clear, concise
and well presented.

168
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,208
My position...

169
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,417
well, frankly, Philip,
it's a tangle.

170
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,458
Two years ago, the queen and I...
for reasons passing understanding...

171
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,833
gave the Aquitaine to Richard.

172
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,208
That makes Richard
very powerful.

173
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,333
How can I give him Alais too?

174
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,167
The man she marries
has you for an ally.

175
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,250
It's their wedding or the vexin back.
Those are the terms you made with Louis.

176
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,208
True, but academic, lad.
The vexin's mine.

177
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,375
By what authority? It's got my troops
all over it. That makes it mine.

178
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:10,250
Now, hear me, boy.

179
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:14,333
I am a king. I am no man's boy. A king?

180
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,292
Because you put your ass
on purple cushions?

181
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,333
- Sir.
- Philip.

182
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,375
You haven't got
the feel of this at all, lad.

183
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:27,375
Use all your voices.
When I bellow, bellow back.

184
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:33,375
I'll mark that down.
This too:

185
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,333
We are the world in small.

186
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,375
A nation is a human thing. It
does what we do, for our reasons.

187
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,375
Surely if we're civilized,
we can put away the knives.

188
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:45,375
We can make peace.
We have it in our hands.

189
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:49,292
I've tutors of my own.
Will that be all? Oh, think.

190
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,333
You came here for a reason. Don't you
want to ask me if I've got an offer?

191
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,333
Have you got an offer? Not
yet, but I'll think of one.

192
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,333
Oh, by the way,

193
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,333
you're better at this
than I thought you'd be.

194
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,333
I wasn't sure you'd noticed.

195
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,292
Well, what shall we hang...
the holly or each other?

196
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:17,333
Would you say, father, that I have
the makings of a king? A splendid king.

197
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,333
And would you expect me, father,
to give up without a fight?

198
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,292
Of course you'll fight.
I raised you to.

199
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,333
I don't care what you offer Philip,
I don't care what plans you make.

200
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,333
I'll have the Aquitaine
and Alais and the crown.

201
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,292
I'll not give up one
to get the other.

202
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:34,333
I won't trade off Alais or the
Aquitaine to that walking pustule!

203
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,292
No, your loving son will not.

204
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,292
Did you hear what he
called me? Clearly, dear.

205
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:45,333
Now, run along. It's nearly dinnertime.
I only do what father tells me.

206
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,292
Go and eat.
Did I say something wrong?

207
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,250
I'm always saying something
wrong. And don't pout.

208
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,250
I'm not pouting. And stand up straight!
How often do I have to tell you?

209
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,250
And that's to be the king.
And I'm to be his chancellor.

210
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,250
Has he told you?

211
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,292
John will rule the country
while I run it, that is to say,

212
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:07,250
he gets to spend
the taxes that I raise.

213
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:11,250
How nice for you. It's
not as nice as being king.

214
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:13,250
We've made you duke of
brittany. Is that so little?

215
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,292
No one ever thinks of crown
and mentions Geoff. Why is that?

216
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:21,250
Isn't being chancellor
power enough?

217
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:24,292
It's not the power I feel deprived
of. It's the mention I miss.

218
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:27,250
There's no affection
for me here.

219
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,250
You wouldn't think
I'd want that, would you?

220
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:38,250
Henry?
Hmm?

221
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:40,250
I have a confession.
Yeah?

222
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:45,250
- I don't much like
our children.

223
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:50,208
Only you... the child I raised but
didn't bear. You never cared for me.

224
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,208
I did and do, believe me.
Henry's bed is Henry's province.

225
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,208
He can people it with sheep
for all I care,

226
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,167
which, on occasion,
he has done.

227
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:02,167
Rosamund's been dead
for seven years.

228
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:06,000
Two months and 18 days.
I never liked her much.

229
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,208
- You count the days?
- I made the numbers up.

230
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:12,042
He found miss clifford
in the mists of wales...

231
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,167
and brought her home
for closer observation.

232
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,667
Liking what he found,
he scrutinized her many years.

233
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:21,042
He loved her deeply, and
she, him. And yet, my dear,

234
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:25,208
when Henry had to choose
between his lady and my lands...

235
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,125
there is no sport in
hurting me. It's so easy.

236
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:33,083
After all the years
of loving care,

237
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:36,125
do you think I could
bring myself to hurt you?

238
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:39,208
Eleanor, with both hands
tied behind you.

239
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,208
She is lovely, isn't she?

240
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,167
Yes, very.

241
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:58,167
Who could I have chosen
to love...

242
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,125
to gall you more?

243
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:03,125
There's no one.

244
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:05,125
Time hasn't done a thing
but wrinkle you.

245
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:08,167
It hasn't even done that. I've
borne six girls, five boys...

246
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,167
and 31 connubial years of you.

247
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:14,667
How am I possible? There
are moments when I miss you.

248
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:18,167
Many? That's my wooly
sheepdog. Do you doubt it?

249
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:21,125
So, wee Johnny gets the crown.

250
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:23,667
I've heard it rumored,
but I don't believe it.

251
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,917
Losing Alais will be hard,
for you do love her.

252
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:30,167
It's an old man's last
attachment, nothing more.

253
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:37,125
How hard do you find
living in your castle?

254
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:40,667
It was difficult in the
beginning, but that's past.

255
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:44,167
I find I've seen
the world enough.

256
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,167
I'll never let you loose.

257
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,083
You led too many
civil wars against me.

258
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:54,083
And I damn near won the last one.
Still, as long as I get trotted out...

259
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:57,083
for Christmas courts and
state occasions now and then...

260
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,083
for I do like to see you...

261
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,083
it's enough.

262
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,083
I'm famished.
Let's go in to dinner.

263
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:12,083
Arm in arm.
And hand in hand.

264
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,125
You're still
a marvel of a man.

265
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,083
And you're my lady.

266
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,083
It's an odd thing, Eleanor.

267
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:37,083
I've fought and bargained
all these years...

268
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:42,125
as if the only thing I had to live
for was what happened after I was dead.

269
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,125
I've something else
to live for now.

270
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,083
I've blundered onto peace.

271
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:50,000
On Christmas eve.

272
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:55,042
Since Louis died, while Philip
grew, I've had no France to fight.

273
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,042
In that lull, I've found how
good it is to write a law...

274
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:02,042
or make a tax more fair
or sit in judgment to decide...

275
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:05,042
which peasant gets a cow.

276
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:10,042
I tell you, there is nothing
more important in the world.

277
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,042
Now the french boy's big enough,
and I'm sick of war.

278
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:23,000
Do you still need
the vexin, Henry?

279
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:26,042
It's as vital as it ever was. My troops
there are one day away from paris.

280
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:29,042
That's a march of 20 miles.
I must keep it.

281
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,000
Henry, dear,

282
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:36,042
if Alais does not marry Richard,
I will see you lose the vexin.

283
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:39,042
Well, I thought
you'd never say it.

284
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:42,083
I can do it.

285
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,000
You can try.

286
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:49,042
We have a pack of barons we
should look the loving couple for.

287
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:52,042
Can you read love in that?

288
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:56,042
And permanent affection.

289
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:19,042
My Richard is the next king,
not your John.

290
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:22,042
I know you, Henry. I know
every twist and bend you've got,

291
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:25,042
and I'll be waiting
round each corner for you.

292
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,583
Do you truly care
who's king?

293
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,042
I care because
you care so much.

294
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:35,083
Don't fight me, Eleanor. What would you
have me do... give out, give up, give in?

295
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,042
Give me a little peace.
A little?

296
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:43,083
Why so modest? How about eternal
peace? Now, there's a thought.

297
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:48,083
If you oppose me,
I'll strike you any way I can.

298
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,958
Henry?
Madam?

299
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Did you ever love me?

300
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:11,000
No.

301
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Good. That will
make this pleasanter.

302
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,958
Well, I've come.
I'm here.

303
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:35,333
What was it you wanted?
Just to talk.

304
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,375
We haven't been alone,
the two of us, in...

305
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:41,417
how long is it, lamb...
two years?

306
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,917
You look fit.
War agrees with you.

307
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:47,958
I keep informed. I follow all
your slaughters from a distance.

308
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,833
Do sit down.

309
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:53,375
Is this an audience, a good-night
hug with kisses or an ambush?

310
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,625
Let's hope it's a reunion.

311
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,833
Must you look so stern?

312
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,417
I sent for you to say
I want your love again,

313
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,833
but I can't say it
to a face like that.

314
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,875
My love, of all things.
What would you want it for?

315
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:10,875
Why, for itself. What
other purpose could I have?

316
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:14,417
You will tell me
when you're ready to.

317
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,875
I scheme a lot, I know.
I plot and plan.

318
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:22,500
That's how a queen
in prison spends her time.

319
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,875
But there is more to me
than that.

320
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:28,500
Can't I say I love a son
and be believed?

321
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,500
If I were you,
I'd try another tack.

322
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:38,542
I've no dammed up floods of passion for
you. There's no chance I'll overflow.

323
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,875
You're a dull boy, dull as plainsong.
La-la-la, forever on one note.

324
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:47,583
I gave the church up out of
boredom. I can do as much for you.

325
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:50,792
You'll never give me up,
not while I hold the Aquitaine.

326
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:55,833
You think I'm motivated by love of hills
and dales? I think you want it back.

327
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:59,833
You're so deceitful, you can't
ask for water when you're thirsty.

328
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:03,833
We could tangle spiders
in the webs you weave.

329
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,750
If I'm so devious,
why don't you go?

330
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,583
Don't stand there
qulvering in limbo.

331
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:13,583
Love me, little lamb,
or leave me.

332
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,250
Leave you, madam?

333
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,625
With pure joy.

334
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:26,625
Departure's a simple act. You put the
left foot down, and then the right.

335
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,625
Mother! Hush, dear. Mother's fighting.

336
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,667
Father's finished working out
the treaty terms.

337
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:36,667
How nice.
Where is your father?

338
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:41,792
Ah, there you are.

339
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,792
Well, have you
put the terms to Philip?

340
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,833
Not yet, but we're shortly granting him
an audience. I hope you'll all attend.

341
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,750
Are we to know the terms,
or would you rather tease us?

342
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:56,292
Not at all. The terms are... what are
you giving to Philip, what of mine?

343
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:59,792
Whatever you've got goes to me. And
what's the nothing Geoffrey gets?

344
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:02,792
My God, boys,
you can't all three be king.

345
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:05,792
All three of us can try.
That's pointless now.

346
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,750
I want you to succeed me,
Richard.

347
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:11,750
Alais and the crown...
I give you both.

348
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,792
I've no sense of humor.
If I did, I'd laugh.

349
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:18,750
- I mean to do it.
- What about me?

350
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,792
I'm your favorite.
I'm the one you love.

351
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:22,750
I'm sorry, John.
I can't help myself.

352
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:26,792
Could you keep anything I gave you?
Could you beat him in the field?

353
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,750
You could.
John, I won't be there.

354
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:32,792
I'm losing too.
All my dreams for you are lost.

355
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,750
You've led me on.
I never meant to.

356
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:37,792
You're a failure as a father.
You know that? I'm sorry, Johnny.

357
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:40,792
Not yet, but I'll do something
terrible, and you'll be sorry then.

358
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:45,792
Did you rehearse all this,
or are you improvising?

359
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,750
Good God, woman,
face the facts.

360
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,708
Which ones?
We have so many.

361
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,667
Power is the only fact.

362
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,667
How could I keep him
from the throne?

363
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,708
He'd only take it
if I didn't give it to him.

364
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,667
No, you'd make me
fight for it.

365
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:02,708
I know you. You'd never give me
anything. True, and I haven't.

366
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,708
You get Alais and the kingdom,
but I get the thing I want most:

367
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,708
If you're king, England
stays intact. I get that.

368
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,708
It's all yours now... the crown,
the girl, the whole black business.

369
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,708
Isn't that enough?

370
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,708
I don't know
who's to be congratulated.

371
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:23,708
Kings, Queens, knights everywhere
you look, and I'm the only pawn.

372
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,708
I haven't got a thing to lose.
That makes me dangerous.

373
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,708
- Poor child.
- Poor John.

374
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:37,708
Who says, "poor John"?
Don't everybody sob at once.

375
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,708
My God, if I went up in flames,
there's not a living soul...

376
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,708
who'd pee on me
to put the fire out.

377
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,708
Let's strike a flint and see.

378
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,208
You're everything a little
brother dreams of, you know that?

379
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,667
- I used to dream about you all the time.
- Ah, Johnny.

380
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:58,667
I'll show you, Eleanor.
I've not lost yet.

381
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:08,667
Well, mummy,
if you want me, here I am.

382
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:15,667
John's lost his chancellor,
has he? And you've gained one.

383
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:19,625
It's a bitter thing
your mummy has to say.

384
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:23,667
She doesn't trust me. You must
know Henry isn't through with John.

385
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:27,625
He'll keep the vexin till
the moon goes blue from cold.

386
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:31,667
And as for Richard's wedding day...
we'll see the second coming first.

387
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,667
The needlework alone can
last for years.

388
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,625
I know.

389
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,625
You know I know.

390
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:41,625
I know you know I know.

391
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:46,667
We know Henry knows,
and Henry knows we know it.

392
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:48,583
We're a knowledgeable family.

393
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,583
Will Richard take me
for his chancellor or won't he?

394
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,583
Why are you dropping John?

395
00:37:55,625 --> 00:38:00,625
Because you're going to win. You will,
with me to help you. I haven't yet.

396
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:03,583
I can handle John. He'll
swallow anything I tell him.

397
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:06,625
I'll take him by the hand and
walk him into the trap you set.

398
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,583
You're good.
You're first class, Geoff.

399
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,583
You'd sell John out to me,
or me to John, or...

400
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:16,625
you can tell me... have you found some
way of selling everyone to everybody?

401
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,625
Not yet, mummy,
but I'm working on it.

402
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:23,583
I don't care who's king,
but you and Henry do.

403
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:26,625
I want to watch the two of you
go picnicking on one another.

404
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:30,583
You have a gift for hating.

405
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:33,583
You're the expert.
You should know.

406
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:36,583
Dear lord.

407
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,583
You've loved me
all these years.

408
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:44,708
Oh, God forgive me. I've upset
the queen. We need you. Help us.

409
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,708
What... and miss the fun
of selling you?

410
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,542
Be Richard's chancellor.

411
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:54,542
Rot.

412
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:03,542
Well, that's how
deals are made.

413
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,167
We've got him
if we want him.

414
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,750
He'll sell us all,
you know,

415
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:12,750
but only if he thinks
we think he won't.

416
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:18,542
Why did I have to have
such clever children?

417
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:27,542
What's the matter, Richard? Nothing.

418
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,542
It's a heavy thing,
your nothing.

419
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:33,542
When I write or send for you
or speak or reach,

420
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:37,542
your nothings come,
like stones.

421
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,833
Don't play a scene with me.

422
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:43,542
I wouldn't if I could.
I'm simpler than I used to be.

423
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,542
I had, at one time,
many appetites.

424
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:49,542
I wanted poetry and power and the
young men who create them both.

425
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,875
I even wanted Henry, too,
in those days.

426
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:57,542
Now I've only one desire left...
to see you king.

427
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:00,583
The only thing you want to see is
father's vitals on a bed of lettuce.

428
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,583
You don't care who wins, as long
as Henry loses. You'd do anything.

429
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,542
You are Medea to the teeth,

430
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:09,542
only this is one son you won't use
for vengeance against your husband.

431
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,542
How my captivity has
changed you.

432
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:19,542
Henry meant to hurt me.
He's hacked you up instead.

433
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Men coveted this talon once.

434
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:29,000
Henry was 18 when we met,
and I was queen of France.

435
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:32,583
He came down from the north to
Paris with a mind like Aristotle's...

436
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:36,542
and a form like mortal sin.

437
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:40,042
We shattered the commandments
on the spot.

438
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:44,083
I spent three months annulling
Louis, then in may, in spring,

439
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,792
not far from here,
we married...

440
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,500
young count Henry
and his countess.

441
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:55,500
But in three years' time I was his
queen, and he was king of England.

442
00:40:55,542 --> 00:41:01,458
Done at 21... five years
your junior, general.

443
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,500
I can count. There was no Thomas
Beckett then, or Rosamund...

444
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:10,083
no rivals, only me.

445
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:14,292
And then young Henry came,
and you...

446
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:18,458
and all the other blossoms
in my garden.

447
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Yes. Had I been sterile,
darling, I'd be happier today.

448
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:26,125
Is that designed to hurt me?
What a waste.

449
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,167
I've fought with Henry over who
comes next, whose dawn it is...

450
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,500
and which son gets the sunset,
and we'll never live to see it.

451
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,167
Look at you.

452
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,500
I loved you more than Henry,

453
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,208
and it's cost me everything.
What do you want?

454
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,500
I want us back the way we
were. No, that's not it.

455
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:50,458
All right, then.
I want the Aquitaine.

456
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:55,417
That's the mother I remember.
We can win. I can get you Alais.

457
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:59,208
I can make the marriage happen, but
I've got to have the Aquitaine to do it.

458
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,125
I must have it back. It's
mine, and I'll never give it up.

459
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:06,167
Shall I write my will,
"to Richard... everything"?

460
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:10,250
Would you believe me then?
Where's paper? Paper burns.

461
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:14,417
I love you.

462
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:17,125
You love nothing.

463
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:21,125
You're incomplete. The human
parts of you are missing.

464
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,208
You're as dead
as you are deadly.

465
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,458
Don't leave me.

466
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:33,333
You were lovely once.

467
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,458
I've seen the pictures.

468
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:39,042
Don't you remember
how you loved me?

469
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,417
We were always hand in hand.

470
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:46,833
Here's how it felt.
As hot and coarse as that?

471
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:51,208
This won't burn.
I'll scratch a will on this.

472
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,375
"To Richard... everything."

473
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,375
Mother!

474
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,208
Remember how I
taught you numbers...

475
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,250
and the lute and poetry?

476
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:07,208
See? You do remember.

477
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,375
I taught you dancing, too,
and languages...

478
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:14,375
and all the music I knew and
how to love what's beautiful.

479
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:20,375
The sun was warmer then,
and we were every day together.

480
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:53,333
William, tell the french king
I'll see him in the parlor.

481
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,333
Yes, my lord.
In half an hour.

482
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,333
Half an hour. Good.

483
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:08,333
Of course, you know there's not
a word of truth to Henry's terms.

484
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:11,333
If that's a warning,
thank you.

485
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:14,333
What if it's an offer?

486
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,833
"What if" is
a game for scholars.

487
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:20,333
What if angels
sat on pinheads?

488
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,833
What if I were king?

489
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:28,333
It's your game, Geoff.

490
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,333
You play it.

491
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,292
John.

492
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:54,250
I made this for father.
All the pieces work.

493
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:57,292
It took months. I'm not a fool.
I know. Now, here's my plan.

494
00:44:57,333 --> 00:45:01,292
I read three languages.
I've studied law.

495
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,250
What plan?

496
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:05,292
We've got to make a
deal with Philip. Why?

497
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:09,250
Because you're out, and Richard's
in. And what kind of deal?

498
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:14,292
A war. If we three join and fight
now, we can finish Richard off.

499
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:17,292
You mean destroy him?
Hmm.

500
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:20,292
And mother too?

501
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,250
And mother too.

502
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:25,792
Now, do we do it? Is it
on? I've got to think.

503
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:29,292
You haven't time.
We are extra princes now.

504
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,292
You know where
extra princes go?

505
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:36,292
Down.

506
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:41,292
Well, does John want a war
or doesn't he?

507
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:45,292
Do you? If John asks for your
soldiers, will he get them?

508
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:48,208
If John wants a war,
he's got one.

509
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:51,208
John, you hear that?
I'm still thinking.

510
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:55,208
Let me help. It's either
Richard on the throne or you.

511
00:45:57,208 --> 00:46:00,208
Do you think we'd win?

512
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,208
I know it.

513
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,208
Henry!

514
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:26,583
But you don't understand. I would
appreciate a little qulet confidence.

515
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:31,250
I've enough nits picking at me.
But you've promised me to Richard!

516
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,208
Good God,
you don't think I meant it?

517
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,208
So that whole scene,
all you said to John...

518
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,250
you think I'd ever give him up when I've
mothered him and fathered him and babied him?

519
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,250
He's all I've got! How often do you
people have to hear it... every supper?

520
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,250
Should we start the soup with
who we love and who we don't?

521
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,167
I think you like passing me
from hand to hand.

522
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:52,167
What am I to you...
a collection plate?

523
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:54,125
Or am I all you've got,
like John?

524
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:57,125
I've got to get
the Aquitaine for John.

525
00:46:57,167 --> 00:47:02,125
- I talk people, and you answer back in provinces!
- They get mixed up.

526
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,167
What's the Aquitaine to Eleanor? It's
not a province. It's a way to torture me.

527
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:08,667
That's why she spent the evening
wooing Richard, wheezing on the coals.

528
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:12,167
She'll squeeze it out of him. My
God, I'd have loved to eavesdrop.

529
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:16,208
"I taught you prancing, lamb,
and lute and flute..."

530
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,208
That's marvelous.

531
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:22,250
It's absolutely me.

532
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:26,167
I thought as long as I was
coming down, I'd bring them.

533
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:28,208
Whatever are you giving me?

534
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,250
You're such a child.
You always ask.

535
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:33,167
"To Henry."

536
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,125
Heavy.

537
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,167
It's my tombstone!
Eleanor, you spoil me.

538
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:40,167
I never could
deny you anything.

539
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:44,750
Don't go. It nettles her
to see how much I need you.

540
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:49,250
You need me, Henry, like a
tailor needs a tinker's dam.

541
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,083
Oh, I know that look.

542
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:55,125
He's going to say
he loves me.

543
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:57,292
Like my life.

544
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:05,083
I talk that way
to keep her spirits up.

545
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:09,125
Well, how'd you do with
Richard? Did you break his heart?

546
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:12,083
You think he ought to
give me back the Aquitaine?

547
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:15,333
I can't see why he shouldn't. After
all, I've promised him the throne.

548
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:20,333
The boy keeps wondering
if your promises are any good.

549
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:24,375
There's no sense asking if the air's
good when there's nothing else to breathe.

550
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:27,125
Exactly what I told him.

551
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:32,125
Have you got it?
Will he give it back?

552
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:35,125
No Aquitaine for John.

553
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:46,083
I have to give him something.
Isn't some agreement possible?

554
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:50,375
Love, in a world where carpenters
get resurrected, anything is possible.

555
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:53,750
You bore him, damn it.
He's your son!

556
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:57,042
Oh, heavens, yes.
280 days I bore him.

557
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,375
I recall them all.

558
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:02,042
You'd only just found Rosamund.

559
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:06,042
Why her so damn particularly?
I've found other women.

560
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:09,458
Countless others.

561
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:11,458
What's your count?

562
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:15,500
Let's have a tally of the
bedspreads you've spread out on.

563
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:21,042
Thomas Beckett's.
That's a lie.

564
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:27,500
I know.
You still care what I do.

565
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:30,542
I want the Aquitaine for John!
I want it, and I'll have it.

566
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:33,542
Is that menace you're
conveying? Is it to be torture?

567
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:38,083
Will you boil me or stretch me...
which? Or am I to be perforated?

568
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:40,542
I have the documents,
and you will sign.

569
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:44,583
How will you force me to... threats?
"Sign or I refuse to feed you."

570
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:50,042
Tears? "Oh, sign before
my heart goes crack."

571
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:54,042
I'm like the earth, old man...
there isn't any way around me.

572
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,083
I adore you.

573
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:59,625
Save your aching arches.
That road's closed.

574
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:03,083
I have an offer for you,
my dear.

575
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,625
A deal? A deal?

576
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:10,667
I give the richest province on
the continent to John for what?

577
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:14,708
You tell me,
mastermind, for what.

578
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,042
Your freedom.

579
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,083
Oh.

580
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,083
Once Johnny gets the Aquitaine,
you're free. I'll let you out.

581
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:36,042
Think: On the loose in london,
winters in provence,

582
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:39,083
impromptu trips to visit Richard
anywhere he's killing people...

583
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:44,042
all that for a signature.

584
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:49,000
- You're good.
- I thought it might appeal. You always fancied traveling.

585
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:50,958
Yes.

586
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I even made poor Louis
take me on crusade.

587
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:57,750
How's that for blasphemy?

588
00:50:57,792 --> 00:51:03,000
I dressed my maids as amazons and
rode bare-breasted halfway to damascus.

589
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:06,000
Louls had a seizure, and I
damn near died of windburn,

590
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,833
but the troops were dazzled.

591
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:21,000
Henry, I'm against the wall.

592
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:25,875
To be a prisoner...

593
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,000
to be bricked in...

594
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
when you've known the world...

595
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:38,000
I'll never know how I survived.

596
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:44,958
These ten years, Henry,
have been unimaginable.

597
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:48,958
And now,

598
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,958
you offer me
the only thing I want...

599
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,875
if I give up...

600
00:51:57,917 --> 00:51:59,958
the only thing I treasure.

601
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,917
Sign the paper, and we'll
break the happy news.

602
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:08,958
The queen is free, John gets the
Aquitaine, and Richard marries Alais.

603
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,958
Yes, let's have it done.

604
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,958
I'll sign.

605
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:19,917
On one condition.
Name it.

606
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:23,917
Have the wedding now.
What's that?

607
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:27,917
Why, I've surprised you.
Surely it's not sudden.

608
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:31,958
They've been marching down the aisle
for 16 years, and that's a long walk.

609
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,917
John can be best man.
That's a laugh.

610
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:39,958
And you can give the bride
away. I want to watch you do it.

611
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,917
Alais...
I can live without her.

612
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,917
And I thought you loved her. So I do.

613
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:50,917
Thank God. You frightened me.
I was afraid this wouldn't hurt.

614
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,875
What a tragedy you are.

615
00:52:55,917 --> 00:53:00,875
I wonder...
do you ever wonder...

616
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:04,875
if I slept
with your father?

617
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:12,417
My father?
It's a lie.

618
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:15,875
But there are rumors.

619
00:53:16,917 --> 00:53:18,875
Don't you ever wonder?

620
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:21,875
Is it rich, despising
me? Is it rewarding? No.

621
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:24,875
Then stop!
How?

622
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:26,875
It's what I live for.
I'll show you.

623
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,875
By christ, I will.
I'll do it.

624
00:53:29,917 --> 00:53:33,625
Where's a priest?
Somebody dig me up a priest!

625
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:37,875
You!
Fetch me a bishop!

626
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:40,875
Get old Durham.
He's just down the hall.

627
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:44,917
Ask him to meet us in the
chapel. John, Richard, Geoffrey!

628
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,833
What's wrong? What's happened?
Richard's getting married.

629
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:25,833
Getting married? Now?
He's getting married now?

630
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,833
I never cease to marvel at
the qulckness of your mind.

631
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:30,833
You can't hurt me,
you bag of bile.

632
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,833
But you can, father.
Why? Because I say so.

633
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:36,833
My lord, the bishop's waiting in the
chapel. Good. Let's get this over with.

634
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:39,833
You'll make a lovely bride.
I wonder if I'll cry.

635
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:42,833
You sound as if you think
it's going to happen. I do.

636
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:44,833
He's only plotting. Can't you
tell when Henry's plotting?

637
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:47,833
Not this time.
He'll never give me up.

638
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,750
You think I won't?
Because you told me so.

639
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:52,792
You're not my helen. I won't fight
a war to save a face. We're done.

640
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:55,792
I don't believe you!
Wait ten minutes!

641
00:54:58,792 --> 00:55:02,792
Please! Richard, Richard,
we're not...

642
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,792
honestly, we're not!

643
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:10,792
Please!
We love each other.

644
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:18,792
Come on! It's lunacy!
I won't do it! I won't!

645
00:55:19,792 --> 00:55:23,792
- Lunacy! Let me go, Henry. Richard, no!
- Come on!

646
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:26,792
I won't say the words!
Not one of them!

647
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:29,792
It makes no sense!
Why give me up?

648
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:32,792
What do you get?
What are you gaining?

649
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:35,833
Why, the Aquitaine,
of course.

650
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,792
What's that again?

651
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:40,792
Your mother gets her freedom,
and I get the Aquitaine.

652
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,792
That is the proposition,
isn't it? You did agree.

653
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:45,833
Of course she did. I knew it. It
was all pretense. I believed it all.

654
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:49,750
I meant it all. No wedding.
There'll be no wedding.

655
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,708
But, my boy, look.
Durham's waiting.

656
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,792
Marry her, for my sake. It
isn't much to ask. Never!

657
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:58,792
But I promised it to Philip.
Think of my position.

658
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:01,833
Damn the wedding and to hell with
your position. You don't dare defy me.

659
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,708
Don't I?

660
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:08,750
You're the king of France, for
God's sake. Speak up. Do something.

661
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,875
Make a threat. Come on,
frighten me. Am I? Dunce!

662
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:14,708
He never meant
to have the wedding.

663
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:18,750
Come again. You're good at
rage. I like the way you play it.

664
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,708
Boy, don't ever call a king
a liar to his face.

665
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:25,917
I'm not a boy...
to you or anyone!

666
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:28,750
Boy, you came here asking
for a wedding or the vexin back.

667
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:32,917
By God, you don't get either. It's no
to both. You have a pact with France!

668
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,750
Then damn the pact and damn France.
She never marries, not while I'm alive.

669
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:39,708
Your life and never
are two different times.

670
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:44,708
Not on my clock, boy!
Listen to the lion!

671
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:48,667
Come on, frighten me. Don't spoil it,
Richard. Take it like a good sport.

672
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,625
How's your bad leg?
Better, thank you.

673
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:53,958
Your bad back? You're getting
old. You'll have me once too often.

674
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:57,667
When? I'm 50 now. My God,
boy, I'm the oldest man I know.

675
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:59,667
I've got a decade
on the pope.

676
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:05,958
What's it to be? The
broadsword when I'm 85?

677
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,667
I'm not a second son now. Your
Henry's lies in the vault, you know.

678
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:13,625
I know.
I've seen him there.

679
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:16,042
I'll have the crown. You'll
have what daddy gives you.

680
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:19,667
I am next in line!
To nothing!

681
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,667
Then we'll only have the
broadswords now. This minute?

682
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,667
No, on the battlefield!
So we're at war?

683
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:26,375
Yes, we're at war. I have 2,000
men at poitiers. Can they hear you?

684
00:57:26,417 --> 00:57:29,083
Call and see who answers. You're
as close to poitiers as you'll get.

685
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:34,167
You don't dare hold me prisoner. Until we're
all agreed John comes next, I can and will.

686
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:38,667
You're a king's son, so I treat you with
respect. You have the freedom of the castle.

687
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:41,125
The castle doesn't stand that
holds me. Post your guards.

688
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:46,667
My God, I'm king again.
Fantastic.

689
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:50,625
Are you happy for me, Geoff?
I'm happy for us both.

690
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:06,167
You played it nicely.
You were good.

691
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:11,417
Yes, I was.
I fooled you, didn't I?

692
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:16,208
Oh, God, but I do love
being king.

693
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:18,167
Well, Henry,

694
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:21,417
liege and lord,

695
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:24,167
what happens now?

696
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,208
I've no idea.

697
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:30,625
I know I'm winning, and I know I'll
win, but what the next move is...

698
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,625
you were scared,
weren't you?

699
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,625
No.

700
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,625
I think you were.

701
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:51,208
I was. You mustn't play with
feelings, Henry. Not with mine.

702
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:56,250
It wasn't possible
to lose you.

703
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,542
I must hold you dearer
than I thought.

704
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:06,542
You've got your enigmatic face
on. What's your mood, I wonder?

705
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:10,542
Pure delight.

706
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:14,542
I'm locked up
with my sons.

707
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:18,333
What mother does not
dream of that?

708
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:27,583
One thing.
Yes?

709
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:31,375
May I watch you kiss her?

710
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:34,500
Can't you ever stop?

711
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,417
I watch you every night.

712
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:40,542
I conjure it
before I sleep.

713
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:43,542
Leave it there.

714
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:47,000
My curiosity
is intellectual.

715
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:50,417
I want to see
how accurate I am.

716
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:58,458
Forget the dragon
in the doorway. Come.

717
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:04,458
Believe I love you,
for I do.

718
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,500
Believe I'm yours forever,
for I am.

719
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:14,500
Believe in my contentment
and the joy you give me.

720
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:17,583
And believe...

721
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:24,583
you want more?

722
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:34,583
I'm an old man
in an empty place.

723
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:38,583
Be with me.

724
01:01:30,542 --> 01:01:34,500
How beautiful you make me.

725
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:43,500
What might solomon have sung
had he seen this.

726
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:47,417
I can't.

727
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:49,458
I'd turn to salt.

728
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,458
I've lost again.

729
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:59,458
I'm done for this time.

730
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:07,458
Well, there'll be
other Christmases.

731
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:13,458
I'd hang you from the nipples,
but you'd shock the children.

732
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:23,958
They kissed sweetly,
didn't they?

733
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,500
I'll have him next time.
I can wait.

734
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:33,500
Ah, there you are!

735
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:39,500
My comfort
and my company.

736
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,500
We're locked in
for another year.

737
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:49,417
Four seasons more.

738
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,417
What a desolation.

739
01:02:57,458 --> 01:03:00,417
What a life's work.

740
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,417
Is it too much?

741
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:12,458
Be sure to squlnt
as you approach.

742
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,458
You may be blinded
by my beauty.

743
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,417
Merry Christmas.

744
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:21,458
Is that why you're here...
to tell me that?

745
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,458
I thought
you might be lonely.

746
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,958
Here, chancellor.

747
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,458
Try it on for size.

748
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,417
It's puzzling.

749
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:35,417
I remember my third birthday.

750
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:38,458
Not just pictures
of the garden or the gifts,

751
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,458
but who did what to whom
and how it felt.

752
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:44,458
My memory stretches that far back,
but never once can I remember...

753
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,375
anything from you or father
warmer than indifference.

754
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:49,375
Why is that?

755
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:54,333
I don't know.

756
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:58,417
That was not an easy question from me,
and I don't deserve and easy answer.

757
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:05,458
There are times I think we
loved none of our children.

758
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,417
Still too easy,
don't you think?

759
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:12,375
I'm weary, and you want
a simple answer,

760
01:04:12,417 --> 01:04:14,417
and I haven't one.

761
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:18,375
I'm so sick
of all of you.

762
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,375
I thought I'd come
and gloat a little.

763
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:24,375
Mother's tired. Come stick
pins tomorrow morning.

764
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:26,375
I'll be
more responsive then.

765
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:29,500
It's no fun goading anyone
tonight. Bastard's boxed us up.

766
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:33,542
What's that, dear? We're his
prisoners, if that interests you.

767
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:36,375
Why should it?
I'm his prisoner anyway?

768
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,542
It was... correct me
if I'm wrong...

769
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,542
but it was my impression that
you wanted Henry's throne for me.

770
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:45,583
We can't win, Richard.
We've lost it this time.

771
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:48,292
You think I'm finished, do you? So I do.

772
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,542
I've suffered more defeats
than you have teeth.

773
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:53,292
I know one
when it happens to me.

774
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:56,542
Take your wormwood like a good
boy. Swallow it and go to bed.

775
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,583
I will be king. So you
will, but not this year!

776
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:03,542
Oh, leave it, Richard!
Let it go for now.

777
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,292
I can't.
It's not so hard.

778
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:09,583
Try saying after me:
John wins, I lose.

779
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,292
And what if John died?

780
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,625
You wouldn't dare! A
knife. Why wouldn't I?

781
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,333
He's got a knife! Of course he
has a knife. He always has a knife.

782
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:21,583
We all have knives. It's
1183, and we're barbarians.

783
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:27,292
How clear we make it. Oh, my
piglets, we are the origins of war.

784
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:30,667
Not history's forces, nor the times,
nor justice, nor the lack of it,

785
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:33,625
nor causes, nor religions,
nor ideas,

786
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:36,542
nor kinds of government,
nor any other thing.

787
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:39,750
Weare the killers.
Webreed wars.

788
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:42,667
We carry it,
like syphilis, inside.

789
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:46,333
Dead bodies rot in field and stream
because the living ones are rotten.

790
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,292
For the love of God, can't we
love one another just a little?

791
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:52,250
That's how peace begins.

792
01:05:53,292 --> 01:05:56,500
We have so much
to love each other for.

793
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:59,708
We have such possibilities,
my children.

794
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:01,708
We could change the world.

795
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,708
And while we hugged each other,
what would Philip do?

796
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:07,750
Oh, good God, Philip!

797
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:11,292
We're supposed to start a war. If
father finds out, I'll be rulned.

798
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:14,583
Steady, John. Don't panic.
Some adviser you are.

799
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:17,792
Don't do anything without me. Let me
handle it. He's made a pact with Philip.

800
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:20,292
You advised John into making
war. That fearless boy...

801
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:22,250
he's disinherited himself.

802
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:25,250
When Henry finds out... when
I tell him what John's done...

803
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:28,542
I need a little time. Can you keep
John from Philip till I say so?

804
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:31,833
Anything you say. Richard, I want
you out of here before this breaks.

805
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:33,833
And that means Philip.
Go to him, be desperate.

806
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,833
Promise anything...
the vexin, brittany.

807
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:39,583
Once you're free and John is out
of favor, we'll make further plans.

808
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:43,292
You see Philip. You're the diplomat.
You see him, you talk to him.

809
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,875
You're a friend.
You know him, I don't.

810
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:51,208
And Richard!

811
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,208
Promise anything.

812
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:03,167
I've got the old boy
this time.

813
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:06,208
The damn fool thinks he
loves John. He believes it.

814
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,875
That's where the knife
goes in...

815
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,875
knives.

816
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:18,208
Knives.

817
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:23,917
Where is that mirror? I'm Eleanor,
and I can look at anything.

818
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,208
My, what a lovely girl.

819
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:32,958
How could her king
have left her?

820
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:49,167
Philip?

821
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:52,167
Philip!

822
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:56,417
It's working out. By morning,
I can be the chosen son.

823
01:07:56,417 --> 01:08:01,417
The crown can come to me. Are you still
with me? We'll have to fight them all.

824
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:03,417
They'll band together once this
happens. Have I got your word?

825
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:07,167
Do I have yours? All England's
land in France if I support you?

826
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:11,417
Are we allies then?
We were born to be.

827
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:14,125
I should say something solemn,
but I haven't the time.

828
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:17,167
I'm off to father with news that
John's a traitor. After that...

829
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:21,417
you stink! You know that?
You're a stinker, and you stink.

830
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:25,167
I'll kill you!
Ah!

831
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:26,542
Lump.

832
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:30,417
If you're a prince, there's
hope for every ape in africa.

833
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:33,542
I had you saved. I wasn't on
my way to father, but he was.

834
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:37,167
He would have gone to Henry and
betrayed you. Look, it's in his face.

835
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:41,167
It's true. I don't know
who my friends are.

836
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:47,125
Philip?

837
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:51,083
May we? That's what tapestries are for.

838
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:55,083
I'll never learn.
I'll ruln everything.

839
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:04,583
Richard?
Hello, Richard.

840
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:08,625
You're halfway to bed. I'll
wait for morning. Come in.

841
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:11,583
Mother sent me.
Come in anyway.

842
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:21,125
Our alchemists have stumbled
on the art of boiling burgundy.

843
01:09:21,667 --> 01:09:26,125
It turns to steam, and when it
cools, we call it brandywine.

844
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:29,667
I'm Henry's prisoner.
You find that charming?

845
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:32,125
No. Then why the charming smile?

846
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:34,125
I thought,
I can't think why,

847
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:36,125
of when you were
in paris last.

848
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:39,708
Can it be two whole years
ago? It can. I need an army.

849
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,708
It'll take the cold away.
I must have soldiers.

850
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:45,083
Have I aged?
Do I seem older to you?

851
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:49,125
They've been two fierce years. I've
studied, and I've trained to be a king.

852
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:53,750
I'll have your answer... yes or
no? You'll have it when I give it.

853
01:09:53,792 --> 01:09:55,750
You see?
I've changed.

854
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:59,125
I'm not the boy you taught to
hunt two years ago. Remember?

855
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,792
Racing after boar,
you flying first,

856
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:06,125
me scrambling after,
all day into dusk.

857
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:10,125
Don't go. I must know. Will you help me?

858
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:13,125
Sit and we'll discuss it.

859
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,875
You never write.
To anyone.

860
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:28,125
Why should I make you
king of England?

861
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:31,083
Aren't I better off
with John or Geoffrey?

862
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:34,125
Why have you to fight when I
could have the cretin or the fiend?

863
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:37,917
Would we fight? We're
fighting now. Good night.

864
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:42,083
You're still a boy.

865
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:45,958
In some ways.
Which way did you have in mind?

866
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:50,042
You haven't asked how much your
help is worth. You'll tell me.

867
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:52,042
You can have the vexin back.
And what else?

868
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:54,792
All of brittany. Does that
matter? That's Geoffrey's.

869
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:57,917
Possibly to Geoffrey. And what
else? That's all your help is worth.

870
01:10:57,958 --> 01:10:59,917
And in return,
what do you want from me?

871
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:01,917
Two thousand soldiers.

872
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:03,917
- And what else?
- Five hundred knights on horse.

873
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:06,042
- And what else?
- Arms and siege equlpment.

874
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:10,958
- And what else?
- I never wrote because I thought you'd never answer.

875
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,042
You got married.

876
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:21,042
Does that make a difference? Doesn't it?

877
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,042
I've spent two years
on every street in hell.

878
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:34,042
That's odd.
I never saw you there.

879
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
You haven't said
you loved me.

880
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
When the time comes.

881
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Shh.

882
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It's not too late
at night?

883
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:50,917
I'd hoped you'd come.
Good!

884
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:53,958
We couldn't leave negotiations
where they were.

885
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,917
Ah!

886
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:03,958
I keep looking for your
father in you. He's not there.

887
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,958
I'll miss him.

888
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:09,958
Has Richard or the queen
been here to see you?

889
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,917
Does it matter? If they
haven't yet, they will.

890
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:16,958
I want to reach a settlement. I
left you with too little earlier.

891
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,917
Yes.
Nothing is too little.

892
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,917
I'm sorry
you're not fonder of me, lad.

893
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:25,958
Your father always said,
"be fond of stronger men."

894
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,958
No wonder
he loved everyone.

895
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:32,958
I've come to you
to offer peace.

896
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,958
Piss on your peace.

897
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:39,958
Your father would have wept.

898
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,958
My father was a weeper.

899
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:45,958
Fight me, and you'll lose.

900
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,875
I can't lose, Henry.

901
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,875
I have time.
Why, just look at you.

902
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:56,875
Great heavy arms. But each
year they get a little heavier.

903
01:13:56,917 --> 01:14:00,917
The sand goes pit-pat
in the glass.

904
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:04,875
I'm in no hurry, Henry.
I've got time.

905
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:08,917
Suppose I hurry things along. Suppose I
say that England is at war with France.

906
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:13,875
Then France surrenders. I
don't have to fight to win.

907
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:17,875
Take all you want... this county,
that one. You won't keep it long.

908
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:21,875
What kind of courage
have you got?

909
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,875
The tidal kind...

910
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:29,875
it comes and goes.

911
01:14:30,917 --> 01:14:33,875
By God, I'd love to turn you
loose on Eleanor. More brandywine?

912
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:38,917
You recognize it? They were boiling
it in ireland before the snakes left.

913
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:43,875
Well, things look a little bleak
for Henry, don't they?

914
01:14:43,917 --> 01:14:48,833
You'll say yes to Richard when he
comes... arms, soldiers, anything he asks.

915
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:50,833
I'd be foolish not to.
Yeah.

916
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:55,833
And withdraw it all before the battle
ever started. Wouldn't you, in my place?

917
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,833
Why fight Henry when his sons
will do it for you?

918
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:01,792
Yes, exactly.

919
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:05,833
- You've got promise, lad. That's
first-class thinking. - Thank you, sir.

920
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:23,792
Good night. Good night? You're
going? We haven't settled anything.

921
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:26,833
We open Christmas presents at noon.
Till then. You can't be finished with me.

922
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:30,833
Oh, but I am. It's been most
satisfactory. What's so satisfactory?

923
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:35,875
Winning is. I did just
win. Surely you noticed.

924
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:40,833
Not a thing. You
haven't won a damn thing.

925
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,833
Hmm.

926
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:48,792
I found out the way your mind
works and the kind of man you are.

927
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,750
I know your plans
and expectations.

928
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:52,750
You've burbled every bit
of strategy you've got.

929
01:15:52,792 --> 01:15:55,792
I know exactly what you will do
and exactly what you won't.

930
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:57,750
And I've told you
exactly nothing!

931
01:15:57,792 --> 01:16:01,792
To these aged eyes, boy, that's
what winning looks like! Dormez bien.

932
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,792
You...

933
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:09,792
you made my father nothing.

934
01:16:11,792 --> 01:16:13,792
You were always better.

935
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:16,792
You bullied him,

936
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:19,750
you bellied with his wife,

937
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:22,792
you beat him down
in every war,

938
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,292
you twisted every treaty,

939
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:27,792
you played mock the monk,

940
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:31,792
and then you made him
love you for it.

941
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:34,750
I was there.

942
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:37,750
His last words
went to you.

943
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:40,792
He was a loving man, and you've
learned nothing of it.

944
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:45,750
I learned how much fathers
live in sons.

945
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:49,708
A king like you has policy
prepared on everything.

946
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:53,708
What's the official line
on sodomy?

947
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,708
How stands the crown
on boys who do with boys?

948
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:06,708
Richard finds his way
into so many legends.

949
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,708
Let's hear yours
and see how it compares.

950
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,750
He found me first
when I was 15.

951
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:13,750
We were hunting.
It was nearly dark.

952
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:16,750
My horse fell,
I was thrown.

953
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:19,708
I woke to Richard
touching me.

954
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,708
He asked me
if I loved him.

955
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,708
"Philip, do you love me?"

956
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,708
And I told him, "yes."

957
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:35,708
Do you know why
I told him yes?

958
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:40,750
So that one day I could
tell you all about it.

959
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:45,208
You cannot imagine
what that "yes" cost.

960
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:49,625
Imagine snuggling
to a chancred whore...

961
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:53,667
and bending back your lips into
something like a smile, saying,

962
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:55,667
"yes,

963
01:17:56,708 --> 01:18:00,667
"I love you,

964
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:03,750
"and I find you...

965
01:18:03,792 --> 01:18:05,708
beautiful."

966
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,708
I don't know how I did it.

967
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:15,750
- No! It wasn't like that!
- But it was.

968
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:20,750
You loved me.

969
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:29,667
Never.

970
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:41,875
Get out. Please.

971
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:43,875
I don't want you here.

972
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:46,792
It's no great pleasure
to be here.

973
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,792
So the royal corkscrew
finds me twisted, does he?

974
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:53,625
I'll go tell your mother. She'll
be pleased. She knows. She sent me.

975
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:56,583
How completely hers you are.

976
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:59,833
You've had four sons.
Who do you claim?

977
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:01,833
Not Henry.
Not my buried brother.

978
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:05,875
Not that monument to muck,
that epic idiot.

979
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:08,750
Why him? Why always him and never me?

980
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:11,625
He was the eldest.
He came first.

981
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:16,625
Christ, Henry,
is that all?

982
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:18,917
You went with Eleanor.

983
01:19:19,208 --> 01:19:22,958
You never called me.
You never said my name.

984
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:28,625
I'd have walked. I'd have
crawled. I'd have done anything.

985
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:33,958
It's not my fault.
I won't be blamed.

986
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,625
I only wanted you.

987
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,042
No, my crown. You want my
kingdom. You keep your kingdom.

988
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:44,000
That I will.
I hope it kills you.

989
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:50,000
Thank God I have another son.
Thank God for John.

990
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:54,042
And who shall we thank for
Geoffrey? You don't think much of me.

991
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:00,625
"Much"? I don't think
of you at all.

992
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:03,583
Nurse used to say
I had your hands.

993
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:07,083
I might have had more of you.
Try seeing me.

994
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:10,583
I haven't Richard's military skill,
but he was here betraying you, not I.

995
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:16,625
I haven't John's... God knows what you
see in John... and he's betrayed you too.

996
01:20:16,667 --> 01:20:18,625
You think I'd ever
make you king?

997
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:21,625
You'll make me king
because I'm all you've got.

998
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,625
I was to be his chancellor.
Ask him why. I've heard enough.

999
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:27,625
For moving John
to treason.

1000
01:20:29,167 --> 01:20:32,208
I don't doubt he offered,
I don't doubt you tried,

1001
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:35,167
and I don't doubt
John loves me.

1002
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:37,625
Like a glutton
loves his lunch.

1003
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:43,625
You turd.

1004
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,208
Well, John?

1005
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:59,167
It isn't what you think.
What do I think?

1006
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:03,250
What Geoffrey said. I wouldn't
plot against you, ever.

1007
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:06,208
I know.
You're a good boy.

1008
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:10,125
Can I go now, please? It's
late. I ought to be in bed.

1009
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:22,292
Couldn't you wait? Couldn't
you trust me? It was all yours.

1010
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:24,583
Couldn't you believe that?
Will you listen to the grief?

1011
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:27,583
Who do you think I built
this kingdom for? Me!

1012
01:21:28,292 --> 01:21:30,292
Daddy did it all for me.

1013
01:21:30,292 --> 01:21:33,583
When can I have it, daddy?
Not until we bury you?

1014
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:38,333
- I loved you.
- You're a cold and bloody bastard, you are.

1015
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:41,333
And you don't love anything.

1016
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:48,375
I'm it.
I'm all that's left.

1017
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:52,333
Here, father.
Here I am.

1018
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:18,500
My life, when it is written,
will read better than it lived.

1019
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,458
Henry fitz-empress, first
plantagenet, a king at 21,

1020
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,500
the ablest soldier
of an able time.

1021
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:29,500
He led men well, he cared
for justice when he could...

1022
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:33,458
and ruled, for 30 years, a state
as great as charlemagne's.

1023
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:39,458
He married out of love
a woman out of legend.

1024
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:43,500
Not in alexandria or rome or
camelot has there been such a queen.

1025
01:22:45,542 --> 01:22:49,458
She bore him many children,

1026
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,417
but no sons.

1027
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:54,458
King Henry had no sons.

1028
01:22:56,458 --> 01:23:01,458
He had three whiskered things,
but he disowned them.

1029
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,458
You're not mine!
We're not connected!

1030
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,417
I deny you!

1031
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:11,417
None of you will get my kingdom.
I leave you nothing!

1032
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:16,458
And I wish you plague! May all
your children breech and die!

1033
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,458
My boys are gone.

1034
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:32,458
I've lost my boys.

1035
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:54,917
You dare to damn me,
do you?

1036
01:23:54,917 --> 01:23:57,417
Well, I'll damn you back.

1037
01:23:57,417 --> 01:24:00,375
Goddamn you!

1038
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:08,375
My boys are gone.

1039
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:12,375
I've lost my boys.

1040
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:19,375
Oh, jesus.

1041
01:24:21,417 --> 01:24:23,375
All my boys.

1042
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:38,333
Henry?

1043
01:27:32,417 --> 01:27:38,250
<i>The Christmas wine
is in the pot</i>

1044
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:44,417
<i>The Christmas coals
are red</i>

1045
01:27:45,417 --> 01:27:49,917
<i>I'll spend my day
the lover's way</i>

1046
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:54,417
<i>Unwrapping all my gifts</i>

1047
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:57,417
<i>In bed</i>

1048
01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:02,458
<i>The Christmas mass</i>

1049
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,458
<i>Is over now</i>

1050
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:11,167
<i>The Christmas prayers
are done</i>

1051
01:28:14,167 --> 01:28:18,167
No one else is caroling.
It might as well be lent.

1052
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:22,500
When I was little, Christmas was
a time of great confusion to me.

1053
01:28:22,542 --> 01:28:26,167
The holy land had two kings...
God and uncle raymond.

1054
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:29,500
I never knew whose birthday
we were celebrating.

1055
01:28:29,542 --> 01:28:32,542
Henry isn't here. Good, we
can talk behind his back.

1056
01:28:33,167 --> 01:28:35,167
What happened?
Don't you know?

1057
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:39,167
There was a scene with beds and
tapestries, and many things got said.

1058
01:28:39,583 --> 01:28:41,542
Spiced wine.

1059
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:45,500
I'd forgotten Henry liked it.
May I stay?

1060
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:49,125
It's your room just as much as
mine. We're both in residence.

1061
01:28:49,167 --> 01:28:51,542
Packed in like the poor,
three to a bed.

1062
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,083
Did you love Henry...
ever?

1063
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:59,542
Ever? Back before the flood?
As long ago as rosamund.

1064
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:04,125
Ah, that's prehistory, lamb. There
are no written records or survivors.

1065
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:07,583
There are pictures. She was
prettier than you. Oh, much.

1066
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:11,625
Her eyes, in certain light, were
violet, and all her teeth were even.

1067
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:13,583
That's a rare, fair feature...
even teeth.

1068
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:18,125
She smiled to excess, but she
chewed with real distinction.

1069
01:29:18,167 --> 01:29:20,125
And you hate her
even now.

1070
01:29:20,167 --> 01:29:22,625
No, but I did.

1071
01:29:22,667 --> 01:29:27,875
He put her in my place, you see,
and that was very hard.

1072
01:29:27,917 --> 01:29:33,125
Like you, she headed Henry's
table. That's my chair.

1073
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:37,208
And so
you had her poisoned.

1074
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,708
No, I never poisoned rosamund.

1075
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,708
Oh, I prayed for her to drop...

1076
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:45,750
and smiled a little
when she did.

1077
01:29:45,792 --> 01:29:48,083
Why aren't you happy?

1078
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:52,750
Henry's keeping you. You
must be cleverer than I am.

1079
01:29:52,792 --> 01:29:54,750
I've tried feeling pity
for you,

1080
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:57,125
but it keeps on turning
into something else.

1081
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:59,750
Why pity?

1082
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:04,125
You love Henry, but you
love his kingdom too.

1083
01:30:04,167 --> 01:30:06,833
You look at him,
and you see cities,

1084
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:10,833
acreage, coastline,
taxes.

1085
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:13,125
All I see is Henry.

1086
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:17,125
Leave him to me,
can't you?

1087
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,125
I left him years ago.

1088
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:25,125
And I thought
I could move you.

1089
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:27,875
Were you always
like this?

1090
01:30:27,917 --> 01:30:30,875
When I was young and worshipped
you, is this what you were like?

1091
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:33,875
Most likely.

1092
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:38,917
Child, I'm finished, and I've come
to give him anything he asks for.

1093
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:44,958
Do you know what I
should like for Christmas?

1094
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:47,083
I should like
to see you suffer.

1095
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:53,917
Alais, just for you.

1096
01:30:58,083 --> 01:31:02,083
Alors, ma petite.

1097
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,958
J'ai peur, maman.
No, no.

1098
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
The sky is pocked with stars.

1099
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:33,042
What eyes the wise men must have
had to see a new one in so many.

1100
01:31:33,083 --> 01:31:36,083
You look cold. I've mulled some wine.

1101
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:39,042
I wonder...
were there fewer stars then?

1102
01:31:39,083 --> 01:31:43,083
I don't know. I fancy
there's a mystery in it.

1103
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:46,000
What's this?
Warm wine.

1104
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Why, so it is.

1105
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
You are as beautiful
as I remembered.

1106
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Off you go.
My widow wants to see me.

1107
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
She came to find out what
your plans are. I know.

1108
01:32:01,917 --> 01:32:05,000
She wants you back.
Go to your room.

1109
01:32:11,042 --> 01:32:14,000
So, you want me back.

1110
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:18,000
She thinks I do.

1111
01:32:18,042 --> 01:32:21,042
She thinks the need
for loving never stops.

1112
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:23,000
She has a point.

1113
01:32:24,042 --> 01:32:26,000
I marvel at you.
After all these years,

1114
01:32:26,042 --> 01:32:29,042
still like a democratic drawbridge,
going down for everybody.

1115
01:32:29,042 --> 01:32:33,000
At my age, there's not
much traffic anymore.

1116
01:32:35,042 --> 01:32:37,000
To your interminable health.

1117
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:45,042
- Well, wife, what's on your mind?
- I've just seen Richard.

1118
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:48,208
Splendid boy.
He says you fought.

1119
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:50,917
We always do.

1120
01:32:50,958 --> 01:32:54,208
It's his impression that
you mean to disinherit them.

1121
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,167
I fancy I'll relent.

1122
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:59,208
Don't you?
I don't much care.

1123
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:01,958
In fact, I wonder, Henry,
if I care for anything.

1124
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,958
I wonder if I'm hungry
out of habit.

1125
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:07,750
I could listen to you lie
for hours.

1126
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:11,250
So your lust is rusty.
Gorgeous.

1127
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,250
Henry, I'm so tired.

1128
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:18,958
Sleep then. Sleep and
dream of me withcroutons.

1129
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,917
Henri a la mode.

1130
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:24,250
- Henry, stop it.
- Eleanor, I haven't started.

1131
01:33:24,292 --> 01:33:27,333
What do you want? You want my
name on paper? I'll sign anything.

1132
01:33:27,375 --> 01:33:29,292
You want the Aquitaine
for John? It's John's.

1133
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:33,333
It's his, it's yours, it's
anybody's. In exchange for what?

1134
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:35,375
For nothing.
For a little qulet.

1135
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:37,375
For an end to this,
for God's sake.

1136
01:33:37,417 --> 01:33:39,375
Sail me back to England,
lock me up...

1137
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:42,375
and lose the key
and let me be alone.

1138
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:49,875
You have my oath.

1139
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:55,917
I give my word.
Oh, well.

1140
01:33:57,625 --> 01:33:59,917
Well, well.

1141
01:34:02,375 --> 01:34:06,917
Would you like a pillow?
Footstool? How about a shawl?

1142
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:11,917
Your oaths are all profanities, your words a
curse, your name on paper is a waste of pulp!

1143
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:15,417
I'm vilifying you, for
God's sake! Pay attention!

1144
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:19,417
How,

1145
01:34:19,917 --> 01:34:21,917
from where we started,

1146
01:34:23,458 --> 01:34:26,917
did we ever reach
this Christmas?

1147
01:34:29,917 --> 01:34:31,917
Step by step.

1148
01:34:34,917 --> 01:34:36,875
What happens to me now?

1149
01:34:36,917 --> 01:34:40,917
That's lively curiosity
from such a dead cat.

1150
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:44,875
If you want to know
my plans, just ask me.

1151
01:34:44,917 --> 01:34:47,458
Conquer china, sack the
vatican, or take the veil.

1152
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:50,833
I'm not among the ones
who give a damn.

1153
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:55,500
Just let me sign my lands
to John and go to bed.

1154
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,833
No, you're too kind.
I can't accept.

1155
01:34:57,833 --> 01:35:01,833
Come on, man, I'll sign the thing
in blood or spit or bright blue ink.

1156
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:04,500
Let's have it done.
Let's not.

1157
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:08,542
No, I don't think I want
your signature on anything.

1158
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:13,542
You don't?
Dear God,

1159
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:17,542
the pleasure I still get
from goading you.

1160
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:21,708
You don't want John to have
my provinces? Bull's-eye.

1161
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:25,833
I can't bear you when
you're smug. I know, I know.

1162
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:30,625
You don't want Richard, and you
don't want John. You've grasped it.

1163
01:35:30,667 --> 01:35:33,833
All right, then,
shatter me!

1164
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:38,667
Let me have it.
What do you want?

1165
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:42,833
A new wife.

1166
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:52,792
Oh.

1167
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:58,750
So,

1168
01:35:58,792 --> 01:36:01,792
I'm to be annulled.

1169
01:36:05,667 --> 01:36:09,667
Well,
will the pope annul me,

1170
01:36:09,792 --> 01:36:11,667
do you think?

1171
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:15,583
The pontiff owes me one
pontificate. I think he will.

1172
01:36:16,792 --> 01:36:19,250
Out Eleanor,

1173
01:36:19,292 --> 01:36:21,708
in alais.

1174
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:29,792
- Why?
- A new wife, wife, will bear me sons.

1175
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:34,792
That is the single thing...

1176
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:39,792
of which I would have thought
you had enough.

1177
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:42,750
I want a son.
We could populate...

1178
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:47,750
a country town with country
girls who've borne you sons.

1179
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:50,750
How many is it?
Help me count the bastards.

1180
01:36:50,792 --> 01:36:52,708
All my sons are bastards.

1181
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:04,750
You really mean to do it.
Lady love, with all my heart.

1182
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,708
Your sons are part of you.

1183
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:10,750
Like warts and goiters,
and I'm having them removed.

1184
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:13,750
We've made them.
They're our boys.

1185
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:16,250
I know, and good God,
look at them.

1186
01:37:16,292 --> 01:37:18,708
Geoffrey...
there's a masterpiece.

1187
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:22,750
He isn't flesh, he's a device.
He's wheels and gears.

1188
01:37:23,292 --> 01:37:26,708
And johnny...

1189
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:29,750
was his latest treason
your idea?

1190
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:35,708
I caught him lying,
and I've said, "he's young."

1191
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:38,708
I found him cheating, and
I've said, "he's just a boy."

1192
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:43,750
I've watched him steal and whore and
whip his servants, and he's not a child.

1193
01:37:43,792 --> 01:37:46,750
He's the man we made him.

1194
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:49,667
Don't share John with me.

1195
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:53,667
He's your accomplishment.
And Richard's yours.

1196
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:58,667
How could you send him off
to deal with Philip?

1197
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:02,667
I was tired.

1198
01:38:02,708 --> 01:38:04,667
I was busy.

1199
01:38:05,667 --> 01:38:07,667
They were friends.

1200
01:38:07,667 --> 01:38:10,667
Eleanor, he was the best.

1201
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:16,667
From the cradle on, you cradled
him. I never had a chance.

1202
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:19,667
You never wanted one. How
do you know? You took him.

1203
01:38:20,667 --> 01:38:23,708
Separation from your husband
you could bear, but not your son.

1204
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:26,708
Whatever I have done,
you made me do.

1205
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:29,208
You threw me out of bed
for Richard.

1206
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,667
Not until you threw me out
for rosamund.

1207
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:37,708
It's not that simple. I won't
have it to be that simple.

1208
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:41,708
I adored you.
Never.

1209
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:44,667
I still do.

1210
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:47,625
Of all the lies,
that one is the most terrible.

1211
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:52,625
I know. That's why
I saved it up for now.

1212
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:09,625
Oh, Henry, we've mangled
everything we've touched.

1213
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:14,625
Deny us what you will,
we have done that.

1214
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:21,583
Do you remember when we met?

1215
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:25,625
Down to the hour
and color of your stockings.

1216
01:39:30,625 --> 01:39:34,625
I could hardly see you
for the sunlight.

1217
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:37,625
It was raining,
but no matter.

1218
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:45,625
There was very little talk,
as I recall.

1219
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:47,583
Very little.

1220
01:39:47,625 --> 01:39:51,125
I had never seen
such beauty.

1221
01:39:51,167 --> 01:39:54,625
I walked right up
and touched it.

1222
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:59,625
God, where did I find
the gall to do that?

1223
01:39:59,667 --> 01:40:02,625
In my eyes.

1224
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:05,625
I loved you.

1225
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:21,625
No annulment.

1226
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:25,625
What? There will be no annulment.

1227
01:40:25,708 --> 01:40:29,625
Will there not? No, I'm afraid
you'll have to do without.

1228
01:40:29,667 --> 01:40:32,708
Well, it was
just a whim.

1229
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:36,750
I'm so relieved.
I didn't want to lose you.

1230
01:40:38,792 --> 01:40:43,750
Out of curiosity, as
intellectual to intellectual,

1231
01:40:44,667 --> 01:40:47,583
how in the name of bleeding
jesus can you lose me?

1232
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:50,750
Do we ever see each other?
Am I ever near you?

1233
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:53,750
Ever with you? Am I ever
anywhere but somewhere else?

1234
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:56,542
Do I write?
Do we send messages?

1235
01:40:56,583 --> 01:41:00,583
Do dinghies bearing gifts float up
the thames to you? Are you remembered?

1236
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:02,542
You are.

1237
01:41:02,583 --> 01:41:06,583
You're no part of me. We
do not touch at any point.

1238
01:41:06,625 --> 01:41:10,083
How can you lose me?
Can't you feel the chains?

1239
01:41:10,125 --> 01:41:13,583
You know me well enough
to know I can't be stopped.

1240
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:17,542
I don't have to stop you.
I have only to delay you.

1241
01:41:17,583 --> 01:41:22,833
Every enemy you have has friends
in rome. We'll cost you time.

1242
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:26,542
What is this?
I'm not moldering.

1243
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:30,875
My paint's not peeling. I'm
good for years. How many years?

1244
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:35,875
Suppose I hold you back for one.
I can. It's possible.

1245
01:41:35,917 --> 01:41:40,583
Suppose your first son dies.
Ours did. It's possible.

1246
01:41:40,625 --> 01:41:43,917
Suppose you're daughtered next.
We were.

1247
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:47,250
That, too,
is possible.

1248
01:41:47,292 --> 01:41:50,417
How old is daddy then?

1249
01:41:50,417 --> 01:41:53,500
What kind of spindly,

1250
01:41:53,542 --> 01:41:57,500
rickett-ridden, milky,
wizened, dim-eyed,

1251
01:41:57,542 --> 01:42:03,542
gammy-handed, limpy line
of things will you beget?

1252
01:42:03,542 --> 01:42:05,500
It's sweet of you to care.

1253
01:42:05,542 --> 01:42:10,542
And when you die, which is
regrettable but necessary,

1254
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:15,500
what will happen to frail alais
and her pruney prince?

1255
01:42:15,542 --> 01:42:20,500
You can't think Richard's going
to wait for your grotesque to grow.

1256
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:24,500
You wouldn't let him
do a thing like that?

1257
01:42:24,542 --> 01:42:28,500
Let him? I'd push him
through the nursery door.

1258
01:42:29,542 --> 01:42:32,500
You're not that cruel.

1259
01:42:32,542 --> 01:42:36,542
Don't fret. We'll wait
until you're dead to do it.

1260
01:42:36,583 --> 01:42:40,500
Eleanor, what do you want?

1261
01:42:40,542 --> 01:42:42,500
Just what you want...
a king for a son.

1262
01:42:42,542 --> 01:42:46,417
You can make more, I can't.
You think I want to disappear?

1263
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:51,458
One son is all I've got, and you
can blot him out and call me cruel?

1264
01:42:52,292 --> 01:42:55,458
For these ten years, you've
lived with everything I've lost...

1265
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:59,458
and loved another woman
through it all, and I am cruel?

1266
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,458
I could peel you like a pear,

1267
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:05,542
and God himself
would call it justice.

1268
01:43:08,458 --> 01:43:10,542
I will die sometime soon.

1269
01:43:11,542 --> 01:43:14,417
One day I'll duck too slow,
and at westminster,

1270
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:16,583
they'll sing out "long live
the king" for someone else.

1271
01:43:16,625 --> 01:43:19,458
I beg you, let it be
a son of mine.

1272
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:24,458
I am not moved to tears.

1273
01:43:24,458 --> 01:43:29,458
I have no sons. You have too
many sons. You don't need more.

1274
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,458
Well, wish me luck.
I'm off.

1275
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:39,458
To rome? That's where
they keep the pope.

1276
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:42,458
You don't dare go!

1277
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:45,375
Say that again at noon.
You'll say it to my horse's ass.

1278
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:49,417
Lamb, I'll be rid of you by easter!
You can count your reigning days!

1279
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:51,375
You go to rome,
we'll rise against you!

1280
01:43:51,417 --> 01:43:53,625
Who will? Richard, Geoffrey,
John and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

1281
01:43:54,417 --> 01:43:57,625
The day those stout hearts band
together is the day that pigs get wings!

1282
01:43:58,417 --> 01:44:01,417
There'll be pork in the treetops
come morning!

1283
01:44:02,667 --> 01:44:05,667
Don't you see you've given them
a common cause: New sons?

1284
01:44:06,417 --> 01:44:08,417
You leave the country,
and you've lost it.

1285
01:44:11,417 --> 01:44:15,417
- All of you at once?
- And Philip too. He'd join us.

1286
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:18,708
Yes, he would.

1287
01:44:20,417 --> 01:44:24,417
Now how's your trip
to rome?

1288
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:29,375
Oh, I've got you,
got you, got you.

1289
01:44:29,417 --> 01:44:33,417
Should I take a thousand
men-at-arms, or is that showy?

1290
01:44:33,458 --> 01:44:35,750
Bluff away.

1291
01:44:35,792 --> 01:44:40,417
Ah, poor thing. How can I break
the news? You've just miscalculated.

1292
01:44:40,792 --> 01:44:42,792
Have I? How?

1293
01:44:43,417 --> 01:44:47,583
You should have lied. You should have
promised to be good while I was gone.

1294
01:44:47,625 --> 01:44:51,750
I would have let your three boys
loose. They could have fought me then.

1295
01:44:51,792 --> 01:44:53,792
You wouldn't keep your sons
locked up here.

1296
01:44:53,833 --> 01:44:55,750
Why the devil wouldn't I?
You wouldn't dare.

1297
01:44:55,792 --> 01:44:58,792
Why not? Let them sit in
chinon for a while. I forbid it.

1298
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:03,333
She forbids it. Did your father
sleep with me, or didn't he?

1299
01:45:05,375 --> 01:45:09,583
No doubt you're going to tell me
that he did. Would it upset you?

1300
01:45:09,625 --> 01:45:13,792
What about the thousand men? I
say be gaudy and to hell with it.

1301
01:45:13,833 --> 01:45:17,875
Don't leave me, Henry. I'm at rock
bottom. I'll do anything to keep you.

1302
01:45:17,917 --> 01:45:21,333
I think you think you
mean it. Ask for something.

1303
01:45:21,375 --> 01:45:24,875
Eleanor, we're passed it, years
passed. Test me. Name an act.

1304
01:45:25,375 --> 01:45:28,875
There isn't one! About my
fornication with your father.

1305
01:45:28,917 --> 01:45:31,875
Yes, there is. You can expire. You first,
old man. I only hope I'm there to watch.

1306
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:37,917
You're so afraid of dying. You're
so scared of it. Ah, poor Eleanor.

1307
01:45:38,375 --> 01:45:43,917
If only she'd lied. She did. She
said she never loved your father.

1308
01:45:43,958 --> 01:45:45,875
I can always count on you.

1309
01:45:45,917 --> 01:45:48,875
I never touched you without
thinking, "Geoffrey, Geoffrey."

1310
01:45:49,292 --> 01:45:52,250
The day you hurt me,
I'll cry out.

1311
01:45:52,292 --> 01:45:55,250
I've put more horns on you
than Louis ever wore.

1312
01:45:55,292 --> 01:45:57,917
Am I supposed to care?
I'll kill you if you leave me.

1313
01:45:58,292 --> 01:46:03,917
You can try. I loved your
father's body. He was beautiful.

1314
01:46:03,917 --> 01:46:07,958
It never happened. I can see his
body now. Shall I describe it?

1315
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,958
Eleanor, I hope you die!
His arms were rough,

1316
01:46:10,292 --> 01:46:11,917
with scars here.
No!

1317
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:15,000
I can feel his arms!
I feel them!

1318
01:46:17,292 --> 01:46:21,250
I feel it!

1319
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:24,000
What?
Have I hurt you?

1320
01:46:25,292 --> 01:46:27,250
Let me finish!

1321
01:46:27,292 --> 01:46:30,292
You were in the next room
when he did it!

1322
01:46:48,042 --> 01:46:50,000
Well,

1323
01:46:50,042 --> 01:46:54,250
what family doesn't have
its ups and downs?

1324
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:01,083
I'm cold.

1325
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:05,125
I can't feel anything.

1326
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:08,250
Not anything at all.

1327
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:16,167
We couldn't go back,
could we, Henry?

1328
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:24,167
William!

1329
01:47:28,625 --> 01:47:32,625
Up! Up!

1330
01:47:40,375 --> 01:47:44,250
When the king is off his ass,
nobody sleeps!

1331
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,125
Up! Up!

1332
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,125
Up! Up!

1333
01:50:07,167 --> 01:50:10,125
Tell her to pack. She
leaves when it's light.

1334
01:50:30,167 --> 01:50:32,125
Up, up!

1335
01:52:32,042 --> 01:52:35,000
- Henry?
- We're packing up and moving out.

1336
01:52:35,042 --> 01:52:39,042
Is there a war? What's happened?
Henry, what's the matter?

1337
01:52:39,083 --> 01:52:41,042
Nothing, for a change.
Would you believe it?

1338
01:52:41,167 --> 01:52:44,958
Where have you been all night?
What for? Making us an entourage.

1339
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,958
We're off to rome
to see the pope.

1340
01:52:47,958 --> 01:52:48,958
He's excommunicated you again.

1341
01:52:49,958 --> 01:52:53,958
No, he's going to set me free.
I'm having Eleanor annulled.

1342
01:52:53,958 --> 01:52:56,958
The nation will be shocked to learn
our marriage wasn't consummated.

1343
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,958
Oh, be serious.
I am.

1344
01:52:58,958 --> 01:53:01,958
It seems that you and I
are getting married.

1345
01:53:03,958 --> 01:53:05,958
By the pope himself.

1346
01:53:09,958 --> 01:53:12,458
You mean it?

1347
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,958
Shall I kneel?

1348
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,958
It's not another trick? The bridal
party's drilling on the cobblestones.

1349
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,958
- She'll find a way to stop us.
- How? She won't be here.

1350
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,917
We're launching her for salisbury
tower when the winds change.

1351
01:53:44,958 --> 01:53:46,917
She'll be barging down
the river by lunchtime.

1352
01:53:46,958 --> 01:53:48,875
If she doesn't stop us,
Richard will.

1353
01:53:48,917 --> 01:53:52,917
Not anymore, I've corked him up. He's in
the cellar with his brothers and the wine.

1354
01:53:52,958 --> 01:53:56,917
The royal boys are aging with the
royal port. You haven't said yes.

1355
01:53:56,958 --> 01:53:58,875
Would you like
a formal declaration?

1356
01:53:58,917 --> 01:54:02,917
There, my finest angle.
It's on all the coins.

1357
01:54:03,958 --> 01:54:07,917
Sad alais,
will you marry me?

1358
01:54:08,958 --> 01:54:11,875
Be my queen.

1359
01:54:11,917 --> 01:54:14,000
We'll love each other,
and you'll give me sons.

1360
01:54:14,917 --> 01:54:17,458
Let's have six. We'll
do Eleanor one better.

1361
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,958
We'll call the first one
Louis, if you like.

1362
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,917
Louls le premier. How's
that for a king of England?

1363
01:54:32,042 --> 01:54:34,917
Henry, you can't ever
let them out.

1364
01:54:35,917 --> 01:54:39,875
You've lost me. Let who out? Your sons.

1365
01:54:39,917 --> 01:54:45,000
You've put them in the dungeon, and
you've got to keep them there forever.

1366
01:54:46,042 --> 01:54:48,958
Do I now? If they're free when you die,

1367
01:54:48,958 --> 01:54:51,875
it's the dungeon
or the nunnery for me.

1368
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:55,042
But, Henry,
what about the child?

1369
01:54:55,875 --> 01:54:57,875
Don't bother me about the child.
The damn thing isn't born yet.

1370
01:54:57,917 --> 01:54:59,833
If they're free,
they'll kill it.

1371
01:54:59,875 --> 01:55:05,083
And I will not live to see
our children murdered.

1372
01:55:09,875 --> 01:55:11,875
Henry!

1373
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:17,125
Are you going down?

1374
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:24,875
To let them out
or to keep them in?

1375
01:55:30,167 --> 01:55:34,167
Could you say
to a child of yours,

1376
01:55:34,208 --> 01:55:37,875
"you've seen the sunlight
for the last time"?

1377
01:55:40,208 --> 01:55:43,875
Can you do it, Henry?

1378
01:55:44,792 --> 01:55:48,167
I shall have to,

1379
01:55:48,208 --> 01:55:50,167
shan't I?

1380
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:40,708
He's here.

1381
01:58:42,708 --> 01:58:47,167
He'll get no satisfaction out of
me. He isn't going to see me beg.

1382
01:58:47,208 --> 01:58:51,625
Why, you chivalric fool, as if
the way one fell down mattered.

1383
01:58:51,667 --> 01:58:54,625
When the fall is all there is,
it matters.

1384
01:59:14,625 --> 01:59:16,625
My barge is sailing
with the tide.

1385
01:59:16,625 --> 01:59:18,625
- I've come to say good-bye.
- Does Henry know you're here?

1386
01:59:19,625 --> 01:59:21,625
I've brought you each a little
something. What's he planning?

1387
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,625
Is he going to keep us here? For God's
sake, mother. I picked it out especially.

1388
01:59:31,667 --> 01:59:33,625
- How heavy is the outside guard?
- That's taken care of.

1389
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:36,667
The courtyard, the gates? They're putting
Henry's train together, and it's chaos.

1390
01:59:36,667 --> 01:59:38,625
You can walk right out. We'll go
to poitiers. He'll expect that.

1391
01:59:38,667 --> 01:59:41,167
But we'll meet him with an army
when he comes. You stick close to me.

1392
01:59:41,208 --> 01:59:43,667
When you run, run hard. Why run
at all? I think we ought to stay.

1393
01:59:43,667 --> 01:59:46,667
Stay here? Till Henry comes.
He will come, won't he?

1394
01:59:46,667 --> 01:59:49,625
And he'll come alone.

1395
01:59:49,667 --> 01:59:52,167
I count three knives to
one. You think we could?

1396
01:59:52,167 --> 01:59:54,667
I'd only do it wrong.
You kill him, I'll watch.

1397
01:59:54,667 --> 01:59:56,708
- Where are you going?
- Up for air.

1398
01:59:56,750 --> 02:00:00,708
Don't stop her. You don't
think I'm gonna let this happen.

1399
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:04,667
If you tell, there'll be a rash of
executions, and you don't want that.

1400
02:00:04,667 --> 02:00:06,792
No, you don't want to lose
one of us, not even me.

1401
02:00:07,667 --> 02:00:09,750
You're clever, but I
wonder if you're right.

1402
02:00:09,792 --> 02:00:13,667
Warn him, it's the end of us. You
warn him not, it's the end of him.

1403
02:00:13,708 --> 02:00:17,667
It's that clear.
Take the knives and run.

1404
02:00:17,708 --> 02:00:20,167
No, Geoffrey's right.

1405
02:00:20,208 --> 02:00:22,917
You're not an assassin.

1406
02:00:22,958 --> 02:00:25,625
Look again.
Richard.

1407
02:00:25,667 --> 02:00:28,875
Spare me that. You brought these
things. You want him dead? You do it.

1408
02:00:28,875 --> 02:00:31,833
You unnatural animal.

1409
02:00:31,875 --> 02:00:34,833
Unnatural, mummy? You tell
me, what's nature's way?

1410
02:00:34,875 --> 02:00:38,667
If poison mushrooms grow and
babies come with crooked backs,

1411
02:00:38,708 --> 02:00:40,625
if goiters thrive
and dogs go mad...

1412
02:00:40,667 --> 02:00:43,792
and wives kill husbands,
what's unnatural?

1413
02:00:43,833 --> 02:00:46,833
Come, here stands your lamb. Come
cover him in kisses. He's all yours.

1414
02:00:47,583 --> 02:00:52,542
No, you're not mine.
I'm not responsible.

1415
02:00:52,583 --> 02:00:55,583
Where do you think I learned this
from? Who do you think I studied under?

1416
02:00:55,625 --> 02:00:58,542
How old was I when you fought with
Henry first? Young. I don't know.

1417
02:00:58,583 --> 02:01:02,542
How many battles did I watch? But those
were battles, not a knife behind a door.

1418
02:01:02,583 --> 02:01:05,917
I never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold.
What were you thinking when you fought him?

1419
02:01:06,583 --> 02:01:08,917
You. I did it all for you!
Of your unnatural animal?

1420
02:01:08,958 --> 02:01:11,542
You wanted father dead.
No, never that.

1421
02:01:11,583 --> 02:01:15,583
You tried to kill him.
Why? What did you want? Yes!

1422
02:01:15,625 --> 02:01:18,958
I wanted Henry back.

1423
02:01:20,958 --> 02:01:22,958
Liar!

1424
02:01:24,583 --> 02:01:28,000
I wanted Henry.

1425
02:01:28,583 --> 02:01:32,000
Don't trust her. She'll
warn him if she gets a chance.

1426
02:01:36,583 --> 02:01:41,042
Dear, dear, whatever
shall we do with mother?

1427
02:02:18,625 --> 02:02:21,125
It wants light.

1428
02:02:26,125 --> 02:02:31,125
What we do in dungeons
needs the shades of day.

1429
02:02:33,542 --> 02:02:35,500
I stole the candles
from the chapel.

1430
02:02:35,542 --> 02:02:40,542
Jesus won't begrudge them,
and the chaplain works for me.

1431
02:02:40,583 --> 02:02:44,083
You look dreadful.
So do you.

1432
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:48,125
I underslept a little.

1433
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:53,458
We can all rest
in a little while.

1434
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:02,167
There, that's better.

1435
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:06,458
Bright and clear,
just like the morning.

1436
02:03:07,208 --> 02:03:09,458
Fine looking boy.

1437
02:03:13,208 --> 02:03:16,458
What do you want from us?
You must be mad.

1438
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:20,458
Why did you have to come here?
Damn it, why did you come?

1439
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:23,750
You were the best.

1440
02:03:23,792 --> 02:03:26,292
I told her so.

1441
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:28,458
You, I loved.

1442
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:31,458
You're going to keep us here.

1443
02:03:32,292 --> 02:03:36,333
You can't ever let me out.
You know you can't.

1444
02:03:36,375 --> 02:03:38,292
I'll never stop.

1445
02:03:39,333 --> 02:03:41,500
I can't stop either.

1446
02:04:11,792 --> 02:04:13,417
Brave boys...

1447
02:04:14,417 --> 02:04:16,417
that's what I have.

1448
02:04:22,958 --> 02:04:25,417
Come for me.

1449
02:04:48,375 --> 02:04:51,375
What's wrong?
You're Richard, aren't you?

1450
02:04:51,417 --> 02:04:53,333
But you're Henry.

1451
02:04:53,375 --> 02:04:58,375
Please, take me back.
Can't we try again?

1452
02:04:58,417 --> 02:05:00,375
Again?
We always have before.

1453
02:05:00,917 --> 02:05:05,375
Oh, yes,
we always have.

1454
02:05:10,417 --> 02:05:13,375
Go on!

1455
02:05:22,458 --> 02:05:24,417
Execute him.

1456
02:05:27,375 --> 02:05:29,417
They're assassins,
aren't they?

1457
02:05:30,458 --> 02:05:33,458
This was treason, wasn't it?

1458
02:05:34,375 --> 02:05:39,375
You gave them life.
You take it.

1459
02:05:46,292 --> 02:05:50,458
Who's to say it's monstrous?
I'm the king. I call it just.

1460
02:05:58,333 --> 02:06:00,500
Therefore, I, Henry,
by the grace of God,

1461
02:06:01,333 --> 02:06:05,292
king of the english, lord of
scotland, ireland and wales,

1462
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:08,292
count of anjou, brittany,
poutou and normandy,

1463
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:10,542
maine,
gascony and Aquitaine,

1464
02:06:12,333 --> 02:06:15,292
do sentence you to death.

1465
02:06:15,333 --> 02:06:19,542
Done this Christmas day
in chinon in God's year 1183.

1466
02:07:06,667 --> 02:07:09,250
Surely that's not
what I intended.

1467
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:14,667
Children.

1468
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:18,250
Children.

1469
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:24,250
They're all we have.

1470
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:29,250
Go on.

1471
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:32,750
I'm done.

1472
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:37,250
I'm finished with you.

1473
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:40,792
You and I are finished.

1474
02:08:08,792 --> 02:08:13,208
You spare the rod,
you'll spoil those boys.

1475
02:08:19,208 --> 02:08:21,875
I couldn't do it, Eleanor.

1476
02:08:23,875 --> 02:08:26,208
Nobody thought you could.

1477
02:08:33,917 --> 02:08:35,917
Come rest.

1478
02:08:36,917 --> 02:08:41,917
I want no women in
my life. You're tired.

1479
02:08:42,208 --> 02:08:45,875
I could have conquered europe,
all of it,

1480
02:08:45,917 --> 02:08:48,125
but I had women in my life.

1481
02:08:50,125 --> 02:08:52,917
Go on, get out.
Go on.

1482
02:09:01,958 --> 02:09:05,917
I should have
killed you years ago.

1483
02:09:06,167 --> 02:09:09,958
You put me here. You made me
do mad things. You've bled me.

1484
02:09:10,167 --> 02:09:13,083
Shoulder it yourself.

1485
02:09:13,083 --> 02:09:16,000
Don't put it on my back.

1486
02:09:16,167 --> 02:09:19,125
Pick it up and carry it.
I can.

1487
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,167
My losses are my work.

1488
02:09:23,167 --> 02:09:25,125
What losses?

1489
02:09:25,167 --> 02:09:28,000
I'm the one with nothing.

1490
02:09:28,167 --> 02:09:31,042
Lost your life's work,
have you?

1491
02:09:32,167 --> 02:09:35,167
Provinces are nothing.

1492
02:09:35,167 --> 02:09:38,125
Land is dirt.

1493
02:09:38,167 --> 02:09:44,083
I could take defeats like
yours and laugh. I've done it.

1494
02:09:44,125 --> 02:09:47,125
If you're broken,
it's because you're brittle.

1495
02:09:49,167 --> 02:09:52,125
I've lost.

1496
02:09:52,167 --> 02:09:55,125
You won.

1497
02:09:55,167 --> 02:09:59,125
And I can't ever
have you back again.

1498
02:10:01,167 --> 02:10:05,167
You're all
that I have ever loved.

1499
02:10:07,167 --> 02:10:11,167
Christ, you don't know
what nothing is.

1500
02:10:12,167 --> 02:10:15,167
I want to die.
No, you don't.

1501
02:10:15,208 --> 02:10:18,667
I want to die.
I'll hold you.

1502
02:10:18,708 --> 02:10:21,917
Henry, I want to die.
Eleanor.

1503
02:10:21,958 --> 02:10:25,167
I want to die.
Let me hold you.

1504
02:10:25,208 --> 02:10:27,167
I want to die.

1505
02:10:28,167 --> 02:10:31,125
You will, you know,
someday.

1506
02:10:31,167 --> 02:10:33,167
Just wait long enough,
and it'll happen.

1507
02:10:38,167 --> 02:10:40,167
So it will.

1508
02:10:45,083 --> 02:10:49,083
We're in the cellar,
you're going back to prison,

1509
02:10:49,125 --> 02:10:54,083
my life is wasted,
we've lost each other,

1510
02:10:54,125 --> 02:10:56,083
and you're smiling.

1511
02:10:58,083 --> 02:11:01,083
It's the way
I register despair.

1512
02:11:05,083 --> 02:11:08,083
There's everything in life
but hope.

1513
02:11:11,083 --> 02:11:13,083
We're both alive.

1514
02:11:15,083 --> 02:11:18,083
And for all I know,
that's what hope is.

1515
02:11:26,125 --> 02:11:29,083
We're jungle creatures,
Henry,

1516
02:11:31,125 --> 02:11:35,083
and the dark
is all around us.

1517
02:11:37,125 --> 02:11:41,125
See them...
in the corners?

1518
02:11:41,125 --> 02:11:44,042
You can see the eyes.

1519
02:11:52,042 --> 02:11:54,042
And they can see ours.

1520
02:12:04,042 --> 02:12:06,042
I'm a match for anything.

1521
02:12:08,042 --> 02:12:10,000
Aren't you?

1522
02:12:10,042 --> 02:12:14,042
I should have been
a great fool...

1523
02:12:14,083 --> 02:12:16,042
not to love you.

1524
02:12:34,042 --> 02:12:36,000
You'll let me out
for easter?

1525
02:12:36,042 --> 02:12:40,042
Come the resurrection,
you can strike me down again.

1526
02:12:40,083 --> 02:12:42,042
Perhaps next time
I'll do it.

1527
02:12:42,083 --> 02:12:45,000
And perhaps you won't.

1528
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
You know,
I hope we never die!

1529
02:12:58,042 --> 02:12:59,958
So do I.

1530
02:13:00,208 --> 02:13:03,000
You think there's
any chance of it?
