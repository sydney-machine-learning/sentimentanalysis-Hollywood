1
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:17,162
<i>- This is Pete.
- Yeah?</i>

2
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,707
We lost him.

3
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:25,629
<i>He's your brother, Ross. If you can't
find him, we have people who will.</i>

4
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,341
<i>And you're paying for the contract.</i>

5
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,377
Excuse me.
Have you got a message for Mr. Ross?

6
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,753
What room, sir?

7
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:50,505
I'm not a guest.

8
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:52,424
- I'll check.
- Thanks.

9
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,391
- That's Johnny Ross.
- Yes, sir.

10
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,063
Sorry, sir, nothing.

11
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:08,815
Nothing?

12
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:11,443
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, sir.

13
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:15,947
Okay, thanks.

14
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:38,845
Thank you.

15
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:58,824
Yes, I'm sure it was him.

16
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:01,952
Sunshine Cab, 6912.

17
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:13,088
- Would you pull up? I want to make a call.
- Right.

18
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,858
Yeah?

19
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:16,443
Delgetti.

20
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:18,945
<i>- What is it?
- Work.</i>

21
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,492
Frank, let me in, will you?

22
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,109
What time did you get to bed
this morning, Frank?

23
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,319
About 5:00.

24
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:17,462
"Mumps vaccine on the market.

25
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:19,423
"The government authorized yesterday...

26
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:24,136
"what officials term the first clearly
effective vaccine to prevent mumps.

27
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:30,058
"...announced it has granted
a license for the vaccine...

28
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:37,649
"...at 12:45, Wednesday..."

29
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:41,945
Why don't you just relax, have
your orange juice, and shut up, Delgetti?

30
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:47,617
Let's go, Frank.

31
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:52,015
Lt. Bullitt to see you, Mr. Chalmers.

32
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:56,019
...conditions in our local politics here.

33
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:58,021
It was purely unintentional, I assure you.

34
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:02,067
It wasn't that I was so well-informed,
it was just that he was so ill-informed.

35
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,611
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

36
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,994
What do you like about...

37
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,249
In Orinda, we have all this beautiful
dry sunshine. Absolutely perfect for roses.

38
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:20,210
I do all my own work.
You should see my hands for pruning.

39
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:23,547
Hello. Lieutenant, how are you?

40
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:27,843
Thanks for coming over.
The name is Frank, isn't it?

41
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,220
- That's right.
- Please call me Walter.

42
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:38,395
I have an important job for you.
Capt. Bennet suggested that you take it.

43
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:42,107
As you know, there is a senate
subcommittee hearing here Monday.

44
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:45,110
I have a star witness
who needs protection.

45
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:47,779
Sam said that
you were the man for the job.

46
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,907
And I can't find a flaw in that statement.

47
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:52,784
Protection from who?

48
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:55,829
The Organization.

49
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:59,249
His name is Ross.
Johnny Ross from Chicago.

50
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:04,296
Once and for all, the top men
in law enforcement are united.

51
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,923
We're going to expose the Organization.

52
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:10,218
I read your speech. Why San Francisco?

53
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,764
Ross is safer here. That's your province.

54
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:16,767
Keeping him out of reach for 40 hours.

55
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,059
Where?

56
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:22,773
The Hotel Daniels.
226 Embarcadero Road. Room 634.

57
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:25,817
He's there now, expecting you.

58
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:29,613
Now that you know where my house is...

59
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:32,699
I hope that we'll get to see
a lot more of each other.

60
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:35,368
Particularly in view of the investigation.

61
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:37,412
A senatorial hearing has a way of...

62
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,707
catapulting everyone involved
into the public eye...

63
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:43,794
with a subsequent effect on one's career.

64
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:47,464
It will be a pleasure to have you along.

65
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:50,884
Have him in court on Monday, Frank.

66
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,568
- What was that all about?
- Pals.

67
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:11,446
You and Chalmers? There's a lot of juice?

68
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,573
Hotel Daniels, 226 Embarcadero Road.

69
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:16,201
State's evidence witness,
we're babysitting. Let's go.

70
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:18,411
- You got any coffee?
- Yeah.

71
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,297
- Yeah, who is it?
- Police.

72
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,215
The roof and the exits.

73
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:26,188
Mr. Chalmers said you'd be here by 5:00.
He guaranteed me that.

74
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:28,607
Sorry, we got held up in traffic.

75
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,401
Got any firearms?

76
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:36,198
No, man, I got nothing on me.
Just my wallet, cigarette lighter.

77
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,450
Want to check me out yourself?

78
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:42,537
No, that's not necessary.
Put that stuff on the bed, will you, please?

79
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,376
How did you get here from Chicago?

80
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,378
I flew.

81
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:55,008
Sure none of the boys were on the plane
with you, or saw you get on?

82
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:57,010
How would I know? I wouldn't know.

83
00:13:57,094 --> 00:13:58,929
Why did you pick this room to hole up?

84
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:01,389
I didn't pick it. Chalmers picked it.

85
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:02,599
Why?

86
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,644
Stay away from those windows.
That's why.

87
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:11,233
Say, look...

88
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:14,861
Sit down and relax, Ross.
It's a long wait until Monday morning.

89
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:16,947
We'd better get a fix on some food.

90
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,074
- What?
- Some food.

91
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:23,370
I know Chalmers wants you to be happy.
We'll do the best we can.

92
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:24,871
Dad, it's for you.

93
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:28,792
Listen, you're not going.
We're going to a movie.

94
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,214
Hold it down. Don't be too late.

95
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:36,925
- Hello.
- Hello. Captain?

96
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:39,678
- Frank?
- We'll see you later, Dad.

97
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:41,555
I've seen Chalmers.

98
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:45,225
- What do you know about Ross?
- Chicago. It could be very big.

99
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:49,396
<i>He had access to all the records. He ran
the wire services with his brother, Pete.</i>

100
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,314
Did Chalmers ask for me?

101
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,152
Do you happen to know why?

102
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:58,864
Yes, I know why.
He's grooming himself for public office.

103
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:02,117
<i>You make good copy.
They love you in the papers, Frank.</i>

104
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:03,618
I see.

105
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:06,204
Okay. So long, Sam.

106
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,750
Say, who were you talking to about me
on that telephone?

107
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:13,795
Mr. Chalmers said
this was just between me and him.

108
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,964
Me and him, and that's all.

109
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:21,094
Delgetti will take the first shift,
Stanton at 12:00. I'll take the third.

110
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:24,055
All you got to worry about
is staying away from the windows.

111
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,641
Especially at night.
You call me before you leave.

112
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,143
Excuse me.

113
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:42,365
Fire escape and the freeway.

114
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:45,619
- Bad news, right?
- Right. Want me to stay?

115
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:47,496
No. Go on home to your wife.

116
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,498
- What shift?
- Second.

117
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,292
If we work on the weekend,
we get two days off?

118
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,878
So long.

119
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,601
- Hi.
- Hi.

120
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,944
Is this the new fountain?

121
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,032
Fountain? All the client can afford
is a leaky faucet.

122
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:28,203
I thought that money didn't matter
to artists.

123
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,997
It costs money to have a soul.

124
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,377
"Friction loss of water in feet
per hundred feet. Length of pipe...

125
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,381
"Formula using constant one-hundred size
of standard pipe in inches."

126
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,716
I want to use
600 gallons of water per minute.

127
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,345
Now, what's the velocity per second
of a five-inch pipe?

128
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,686
Look to the extreme right.

129
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:55,647
Now go down the figures
until you find 600.

130
00:16:58,316 --> 00:16:59,401
Got it.

131
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:02,654
Now go across
until you find the five-inch pipe column.

132
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,449
- What does it say?
- 9.8.

133
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,201
Now I want the loss in feet.

134
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:11,913
Feet?

135
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:15,584
Well?

136
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,628
I lost my place. Nobody's perfect.

137
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:29,848
- May I use your phone, please?
- Good evening. It's right this way.

138
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,770
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

139
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:40,984
<i>- Yeah?
- Del?</i>

140
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:45,113
Coffee Cantata. 931-0770.

141
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:48,200
<i>- 931-0770.
- Right.</i>

142
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,829
If a Sgt. Delgetti calls me,
would you please let me know right away?

143
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:54,998
- I certainly will.
- Thank you.

144
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:48,487
Yes?

145
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:50,655
Del. I'm coming off now.

146
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:53,283
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, sure.

147
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:56,912
Hold it down, will you?

148
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:58,997
I'm sorry.

149
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:09,716
- Anything for Stanton?
- No, I'll see you tomorrow.

150
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:26,983
Who was it?

151
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,866
Something exciting?

152
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,618
Go to sleep.

153
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,163
Meaning you won't tell me anything.

154
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:43,708
It's not for you, baby.

155
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:49,297
Anything you do is part of me.

156
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,853
<i>Front desk. Two gentlemen.
Shall I send them up?</i>

157
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:48,523
<i>- What are their names?
- Hold on a minute.</i>

158
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,403
<i>Mr. Chalmers and a friend.</i>

159
00:21:57,199 --> 00:22:00,619
Listen, tell them to wait.
And give me 421-7596.

160
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:14,132
<i>- Frank?
- Yeah.</i>

161
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:18,136
Chalmers is downstairs with another man.
They want to come up.

162
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:22,349
Chalmers, at 1:00 a. M? Don't let them in.
I'll be there in five minutes.

163
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:23,809
All right.

164
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:25,977
Please, away from the door.

165
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:28,188
<i>Here are the latest baseball scores, just in.</i>

166
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:30,398
<i>In the National League,
San Francisco Giants...</i>

167
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,901
<i>beat the Dodgers in both ends
of a double-header.</i>

168
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,822
<i>A 2-0 shutout in the twilighter,
and a 4-1 win in the nightcap.</i>

169
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:53,922
No, wait.

170
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,841
Now look.

171
00:22:58,218 --> 00:22:59,719
He told me...

172
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,865
Holy mackerel!

173
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,630
- Who is it?
- Ross. Two guys got him with a shotgun.

174
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:17,798
And Stanton?

175
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:20,258
They got him in the leg.
They're bringing him down.

176
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:22,052
Stick with Ross. Barney.

177
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:24,888
As soon as the lab men
get out of 634, seal it.

178
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:27,265
- Let's seal it, Barney.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,162
- How bad?
- Bad. He's got a bleeder.

180
00:25:46,219 --> 00:25:47,846
The door is not open.

181
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:51,016
Somebody screwed up.
The door's not open.

182
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:52,809
Somebody put the bed in.

183
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,755
I know you're hurting...

184
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:23,924
but I've got to know now.

185
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:26,843
The two men. Do you remember anything?

186
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:30,889
Caucasian.

187
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:35,310
The one who fired, about 5'10". White hair.

188
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,730
Gun, Winchester pump.

189
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:42,734
All I remember. Came in so fast.

190
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:49,908
Chain was off. He unlocked the door.

191
00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:51,243
Who unlocked it?

192
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,954
Ross. Like he was expecting someone.

193
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,582
How is my leg?

194
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:01,545
Hold on, Carl,
we'll be there in a couple of minutes.

195
00:27:30,907 --> 00:27:32,659
Get out of the way.

196
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,330
To the right.

197
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:47,090
Let's go.

198
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:52,053
Scissors, Jones.

199
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:55,974
Somebody get the blood pressure.

200
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,642
Oxygen.

201
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,397
Can I have an ABD pad?

202
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:10,238
Can you move your hand?
Do you want to step out?

203
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:13,116
Your buddy's all right.
His leg's gonna be okay.

204
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,035
Somebody get x-rays.

205
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,247
How's Stanton?

206
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:22,417
He'll be all right, but he's busted up. Ross?

207
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,336
I don't know, Frank.

208
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:28,215
You better call Stanton's wife
and get her over here.

209
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:29,466
Okay.

210
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:38,850
Intercostal vessels, move them away.
Suture ligature.

211
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,269
- Here you go.
- What is it?

212
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,604
3-0.

213
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,607
- What's his blood pressure now?
- Scissors.

214
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:50,112
It's down to 90 over 70.
Started the blood line.

215
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,658
Suture.

216
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:56,159
Kelly.

217
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:58,995
Scissors.

218
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:03,291
- Better let me tie this one.
- Okay.

219
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:09,256
Metzenbaum, please.

220
00:29:10,924 --> 00:29:12,134
Here you go.

221
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,679
BP's dropping. Pulse is also going up now.

222
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,516
What was it pre-op?

223
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:23,311
- BP pre-op was 140 over 90.
- Kahn, take this.

224
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,022
- Now it's 90 over 70.
- How much blood do you have?

225
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:29,317
We have four up here,
and we've ordered four more units.

226
00:29:30,527 --> 00:29:32,362
How much have you given him?

227
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:36,658
- We're starting the first one right now.
- You'd better bring me another one.

228
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,910
Mayo, please.

229
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,337
- This is the subclavian.
- Here's your wipe, Doctor.

230
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,590
Thank you, Deanne.

231
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,014
- 2-0 Dermalon.
- Yes, sir.

232
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:07,397
- What are his chances?
- No more than fifty-fifty.

233
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:11,193
We stopped the hemorrhaging, but they
got some of the major blood vessels.

234
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,861
Thank you, Doctor.

235
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:24,266
- How is he doing?
- Holding.

236
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:27,853
- Stanton?
- Okay. He's sleeping now.

237
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,522
I want to talk to you.

238
00:31:40,907 --> 00:31:42,826
I got the report back from the lab.

239
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:45,495
Nothing at the hotel.
How come they got in?

240
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:49,207
Ross got to the door,
unhooked the chain from the inside.

241
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:54,463
He let the killers in himself?
Why would he do a thing like that?

242
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:57,382
I'm waiting to ask him.

243
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,677
What about the setup?
What do you think about that?

244
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:03,597
Shotgun and a backup man. Professionals.

245
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,599
Yep.

246
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:17,068
I had to call Chalmers.

247
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:19,529
And?

248
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:22,324
It didn't go down too good.
It's the main event for him.

249
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,659
You know,
the senate subcommittee hearing.

250
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,412
He can't produce the big surprise
he promised everyone.

251
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:30,832
He may try to make up some mileage
by laying it on us.

252
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:34,586
Play it by the book from now on.

253
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:38,507
Does Chalmers run this case, or do I?

254
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,093
All I'm interested in is results.

255
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,595
Do whatever you think is best.

256
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:48,517
I'll try to back you up.

257
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:08,620
Excuse me, sir.
Are you the policeman who hasn't eaten?

258
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:10,080
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:12,249
- Thank you.
- Surely.

260
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:38,817
Where is he?

261
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:02,090
How is he, Doctor?

262
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:05,635
As well as can be expected.
He's still under the anesthesia.

263
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,845
I'm Walter Chalmers.

264
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:10,724
Is there any possibility of my getting
a deposition from Ross before Monday?

265
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:14,811
That's impossible to say at this time.
He may remain in shock.

266
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:18,732
I thank you for doing all you can, Doctor.

267
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:23,612
Get the supervisor.

268
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,583
Now, what went wrong, Lieutenant?

269
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,920
- Who else knew where he was?
- What?

270
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,090
Who else knew where he was?

271
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,759
What are you implying?

272
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:49,930
They knew where to look for him,
and they used your name to get in.

273
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,352
Are you suggesting
I disclosed his whereabouts?

274
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,980
Somebody did. And it didn't come from us.

275
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,983
That's hardly the issue.

276
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:05,487
Well, it certainly is.

277
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:09,616
I've got an officer with a family.

278
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,328
And he's shot up pretty bad.

279
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,541
And I've got a witness who can't talk.

280
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:22,003
I want to know about Ross.
What was the deal you made with him?

281
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,255
Deal?

282
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:28,802
Lieutenant, don't try to evade
the responsibility.

283
00:35:29,302 --> 00:35:32,139
In your parlance, you blew it.

284
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:35,225
You knew the significance
of his testimony.

285
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:38,895
Yet you failed to take
adequate measures to protect him.

286
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:41,606
So to you it was a job. No more.

287
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:47,279
Were it more, and you had the dedication
I was led to believe...

288
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:50,031
You believe what you want.

289
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:53,660
You work your side of the street,
and I'll work mine.

290
00:35:57,873 --> 00:36:01,626
Lieutenant, I shall personally officiate
at your public crucifixion...

291
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,588
if Ross doesn't recover
during the course of the hearing...

292
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:07,007
so I can at least present his deposition.

293
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:11,803
And I assure you, I shall not suffer
the consequence of your incompetence.

294
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:14,347
And even if there wasn't any...

295
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:18,560
I'm rather certain
I can prove negligence on your part.

296
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,692
There may be another attempt on his life.

297
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:29,196
I'll be back in the morning,
with my people.

298
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,075
Thank you, Doctor.

299
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,048
I'd like to have Dr. Willard replaced.
I think he's too young and inexperienced.

300
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:51,009
I'd prefer my surgeon.
Inform the administrator, please.

301
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:54,805
- But Dr. Willard is one of our...
- I'd like him replaced, if you don't mind.

302
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:58,725
- I'll report this to our administrator.
- Thank you very much.

303
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:42,352
Doctor?

304
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:44,813
A relative of mine,
he's here with a gunshot wound.

305
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,023
Could you please tell me
where I can find him?

306
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:50,444
- Why don't you try at the reception desk?
- There's no one there.

307
00:37:50,527 --> 00:37:53,238
He could be on the second floor
in the emergency room.

308
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:54,948
Thanks, Doctor.

309
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:04,374
Yes?

310
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,252
Lieutenant, it's for you.

311
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,343
Thank you.

312
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:17,345
Yes?

313
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:20,223
Dr. Kenner. This probably isn't important...

314
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:24,603
but a man asked me if a relative of his
with a gunshot wound was in the hospital.

315
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:27,189
I thought you should know about it.

316
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:29,941
Was he about 5'10"? Gray hair?

317
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,069
I'm afraid I told him
that he was on the second floor.

318
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:34,571
Thank you.

319
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:41,119
Delgetti.

320
00:38:41,203 --> 00:38:44,122
Our man is in the building.
He was tipped where to find Ross.

321
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:47,084
- You take the ground floor, okay?
- Got it.

322
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:57,010
Get in Ross' room. Nobody in,
except Dr. Willard and the nurses.

323
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,101
There's a man down the stairs!

324
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,733
Polly, call Anesthesia
and bring the crash cart.

325
00:43:24,236 --> 00:43:27,239
Doctor, there's a cardiac arrest in the ICU.

326
00:44:00,522 --> 00:44:03,150
Get Delgetti.
You and the patrolman cover the lobby.

327
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:04,401
Okay.

328
00:44:10,907 --> 00:44:13,118
I can't get a blood pressure.

329
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:14,369
Go.

330
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,165
Do you want to defibrillate again?

331
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:21,418
Not now. Not with that complex.

332
00:44:26,465 --> 00:44:28,675
- How much bicarb?
- Fifteen.

333
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:30,177
Go ahead. Push it in.

334
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,096
- Do you want some lactose?
- Draw some up.

335
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,808
- Any pupillary reaction?
- No. Dilated and fixed.

336
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,397
Get some calcium up, too.

337
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:52,991
What's that now? What's he got?

338
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:56,036
No activity.

339
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,165
I need some more epinephrine.

340
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:03,460
0.5 milligram, please.

341
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:22,395
Doctor, I need your help.

342
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:24,689
What is it?

343
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:29,569
I want this kept open.

344
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:32,656
If Chalmers finds out that Ross died,
he'll fold this up.

345
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:35,700
- I want the man that killed him.
- I understand.

346
00:45:35,784 --> 00:45:39,287
- But I don't want your head on a block.
- I understand.

347
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:42,582
His chart could be misplaced.

348
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,295
You filed it. It's missing.
I'll take the responsibility.

349
00:45:51,174 --> 00:45:52,592
All right.

350
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:06,690
Call the coroner's office.
Tell them to put Ross under a John Doe.

351
00:46:06,773 --> 00:46:10,485
I want a private ambulance, unmarked,
and I want it quiet.

352
00:46:53,612 --> 00:46:55,614
Far as you go, Doctor.

353
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,575
Take it slow.

354
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:18,804
City morgue. Let's go.

355
00:48:54,274 --> 00:48:55,734
Fresh today.

356
00:50:05,762 --> 00:50:10,308
See if Dr. Willard is still in the hospital.
Get Lt. Bullitt on the phone.

357
00:50:16,356 --> 00:50:19,860
I'm sorry, Joe.
He's been transferred to another room.

358
00:50:21,778 --> 00:50:23,488
May I have an outside line, please?

359
00:50:23,572 --> 00:50:27,701
- May I speak to your supervisor, please?
- I'm afraid she's busy at the moment.

360
00:50:27,784 --> 00:50:32,205
I'd be grateful if you'd tell her that
Chalmers wishes to see her immediately.

361
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:35,125
- It's very urgent.
- Yes, Mr. Chalmers.

362
00:50:39,296 --> 00:50:43,008
I'd like to speak
with Dr. Willard, please. Thank you.

363
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:56,104
Yes? Can I help you?

364
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:58,064
I wanted the other supervisor.

365
00:50:58,148 --> 00:51:00,442
The night supervisor went off duty
an hour ago.

366
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:02,861
I'm Mrs. Francis. May I help you?

367
00:51:02,944 --> 00:51:06,990
You may, indeed. There was
a patient here. His name is Johnny Ross.

368
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:10,243
- And he seems to have disappeared.
- Disappeared?

369
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:14,539
He was in Intensive Care, but there's no
record of his whereabouts in the hospital.

370
00:51:14,623 --> 00:51:16,041
That's impossible.

371
00:51:16,124 --> 00:51:19,503
- May I see his medical chart?
- I'm sorry but hospital regulations...

372
00:51:19,586 --> 00:51:23,215
It's an official police request.
Is it not, Capt. Baker?

373
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,720
- Yes, Captain. I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

374
00:51:29,805 --> 00:51:32,933
Excuse me,
but Dr. Willard has gone off duty.

375
00:51:33,308 --> 00:51:35,060
Call him at home.

376
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:40,524
- Are you sure he's not there?
- Do you have Dr. Willard's home number?

377
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:42,192
- Dr. Willard?
- Yes.

378
00:51:42,526 --> 00:51:46,363
I'm sorry, but there's been some
medical complication with my witness.

379
00:51:46,446 --> 00:51:48,990
I'm afraid I'll have to forego
that bedside picture...

380
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:52,661
as much as it would've compensated
for his inability to testify tomorrow.

381
00:51:52,744 --> 00:51:55,872
But in all decency,
I can hardly force the issue.

382
00:51:56,748 --> 00:52:00,335
Does this mean your surprise witness
won't be able to make any statement?

383
00:52:00,419 --> 00:52:02,838
The man was near death
when he was brought in here.

384
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:04,589
In view of the attempt on his life...

385
00:52:04,673 --> 00:52:07,050
I'm sure you can understand
my reasons for secrecy.

386
00:52:07,134 --> 00:52:09,845
- Yeah, of course.
- Good to see you again.

387
00:52:12,264 --> 00:52:15,392
- Can't reach Lt. Bullitt, either.
- Keep trying.

388
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:19,980
I can't find Mr. Ross' medical chart.
It's evidently been misplaced.

389
00:52:20,063 --> 00:52:22,023
- Or appropriated.
- Appropriated?

390
00:52:22,107 --> 00:52:25,652
All right. I'll inform the administrator.
Thank you very much.

391
00:52:27,904 --> 00:52:31,032
I want a complete list of the staff
who might've been involved...

392
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:33,410
in helping Bullitt spirit Johnny Ross
out of here.

393
00:52:33,493 --> 00:52:36,663
I'm certain he grabbed my witness
for his personal aggrandizement.

394
00:52:36,747 --> 00:52:38,707
- I'll lay odds on that.
- And find Ross.

395
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:42,544
- I'll get on it right away.
- Mr. Chalmers, I have Lt. Bullitt.

396
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:50,510
All right, where's my witness?

397
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:52,721
I've got him.

398
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:54,556
Where is he?

399
00:52:55,432 --> 00:52:57,893
Are you going to tell me or not?

400
00:52:58,393 --> 00:53:00,979
Well, I can't at the present time.

401
00:53:02,105 --> 00:53:05,358
Capt. Baker would like
to have a word with you.

402
00:53:08,195 --> 00:53:10,530
Now listen to me, Lieutenant.

403
00:53:13,283 --> 00:53:16,453
- Nail him. I want him written off.
- No problem.

404
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,752
You want some breakfast?

405
00:53:24,252 --> 00:53:25,712
Just coffee.

406
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,348
Thank you.

407
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:22,060
For what?

408
00:54:40,245 --> 00:54:41,538
All clear, Lieutenant.

409
00:54:41,621 --> 00:54:43,957
- Is it open?
- The door's open, sir.

410
00:56:03,203 --> 00:56:07,124
Think back to the time the two of them
first came in and you saw them.

411
00:56:07,207 --> 00:56:08,959
Anything you can remember?

412
00:56:09,709 --> 00:56:13,130
Like I said, they hit me
before I got a chance to look at them.

413
00:56:13,213 --> 00:56:15,924
I don't remember nothing
about them. Nothing.

414
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:19,636
- Start remembering.
- I can't.

415
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:22,139
And that's the honest truth.

416
00:56:22,222 --> 00:56:24,474
Delgetti, take him downtown.

417
00:56:25,058 --> 00:56:27,978
Lieutenant, give him a chance, will you?
He's trying.

418
00:56:28,061 --> 00:56:30,188
He's not trying hard enough.

419
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:32,983
It will come to him.

420
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:36,611
You're wasting your time.

421
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:44,077
Okay, come on.

422
00:56:45,203 --> 00:56:47,998
One thing about the guy who hit me...

423
00:56:48,248 --> 00:56:50,125
He had a square face.

424
00:56:51,543 --> 00:56:55,380
There wasn't much light here.
They try to save on electricity.

425
00:56:57,466 --> 00:56:58,884
Like this?

426
00:57:05,474 --> 00:57:06,975
No. Thinner.

427
00:57:10,353 --> 00:57:13,190
That's it. Now it's coming back.

428
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:16,193
Let's go to the guy in 634.

429
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,987
- No luggage?
- That's right, sir.

430
00:57:19,321 --> 00:57:21,740
- And he didn't store anything?
- No, sir.

431
00:57:21,823 --> 00:57:24,743
He came in empty, which means
you gave him a good look-over.

432
00:57:24,826 --> 00:57:27,913
Always do.
They're the ones I give the eye to.

433
00:57:28,038 --> 00:57:29,706
Then you saw how he arrived?

434
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:32,375
- Yes, sir. In a cab.
- What line?

435
00:57:32,751 --> 00:57:34,252
Sunshine Cab.

436
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:41,384
- The guy who hit you, how old was he?
- About 50.

437
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:42,928
What was his hair like?

438
00:57:43,011 --> 00:57:45,847
Gray. Getting bald. Bald on both sides.

439
00:57:46,389 --> 00:57:48,433
- That?
- No, balder.

440
00:57:49,142 --> 00:57:51,019
Am I helping you, sir?

441
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,063
I never had it so good.

442
00:58:44,448 --> 00:58:46,366
His first stop was the Mark.

443
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:48,577
- How long?
- Not long.

444
00:58:49,494 --> 00:58:51,538
Pull over there and wait.

445
00:59:39,002 --> 00:59:40,504
<i>- Hello.
- Eddy?</i>

446
00:59:41,171 --> 00:59:45,217
Dues time. I need some information
on a Johnny Ross. Chicago.

447
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:48,637
<i>Give me half an hour.
Meet you at Enrico's.</i>

448
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:50,472
Right.

449
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:02,901
- Two.
- Two what?

450
01:00:02,984 --> 01:00:05,946
Calls. He called twice.
The second was long distance.

451
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:08,657
How do you know it was long distance?

452
01:00:09,324 --> 01:00:11,576
He put in a lot of change.

453
01:00:39,938 --> 01:00:43,191
Good morning, Sam.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

454
01:00:43,275 --> 01:00:45,402
This is Mr. Chalmers.
My wife, Mrs. Bennet.

455
01:00:45,485 --> 01:00:48,530
- My son, Paul. My son, Tony.
- Tony, how are you?

456
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:51,241
Would you mind
if I had a moment alone with Sam?

457
01:00:51,324 --> 01:00:52,951
No, of course not.

458
01:00:55,871 --> 01:00:59,499
Must be difficult raising children
in the world of today.

459
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:02,377
I presume Tony is a college student.

460
01:01:02,711 --> 01:01:04,463
Yes, that's right.

461
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,424
I can well imagine the financial strain...

462
01:01:07,507 --> 01:01:10,510
of sending a boy to university
on the salary of a captain.

463
01:01:10,594 --> 01:01:12,971
There's no reason why
a man with your potential...

464
01:01:13,054 --> 01:01:16,391
shouldn't move right up,
given the right support.

465
01:01:16,975 --> 01:01:19,853
My family is waiting for me, Mr. Chalmers.

466
01:01:21,521 --> 01:01:23,899
Bullitt abducted my witness.

467
01:01:24,608 --> 01:01:26,610
He removed him from the hospital.

468
01:01:26,693 --> 01:01:30,530
As his superior officer, I've given him
complete charge of the case.

469
01:01:30,614 --> 01:01:33,700
If he's moving Ross around,
it's for a reason.

470
01:01:34,576 --> 01:01:38,663
So you mean that you would not order
him to reveal where he's keeping Ross?

471
01:01:38,747 --> 01:01:40,916
It's his case, Mr. Chalmers.

472
01:01:43,794 --> 01:01:47,506
Captain, I'm serving you
with a writ of habeas corpus...

473
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,635
making you responsible
for the delivery of Ross.

474
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:54,805
Duly observed...

475
01:01:54,888 --> 01:01:56,598
you have received it.

476
01:01:58,517 --> 01:02:02,854
I need that witness
to prove his very existence.

477
01:02:02,938 --> 01:02:04,106
Now do you know...

478
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:06,983
Excuse me, sir. Dad, Mom is waiting.

479
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:09,569
Would you excuse us
for just another moment, Tony?

480
01:02:09,653 --> 01:02:11,196
All right, Son.

481
01:02:11,988 --> 01:02:15,075
I do not choose to have
people accuse me of false promises...

482
01:02:15,158 --> 01:02:17,244
for the sake of cheap sensationalism...

483
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:20,956
or to be compromised
by your lieutenant. Or castrated.

484
01:02:45,021 --> 01:02:47,232
Wait for me. I won't be long.

485
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:43,789
According to my sources,
the Organization's Chicago branch...

486
01:03:44,206 --> 01:03:47,042
caught Johnny Ross
with his hands in the till.

487
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:48,668
They estimate he siphoned off...

488
01:03:48,752 --> 01:03:52,005
about $2 million
while operating their wire service.

489
01:03:52,089 --> 01:03:56,259
The story is they tried to get rid of him.
Friday night. Chicago.

490
01:03:57,052 --> 01:03:58,386
Chicago?

491
01:03:58,595 --> 01:04:02,432
He got away unharmed.
They believe he's hiding here in town.

492
01:04:02,516 --> 01:04:04,309
How old is this information, Eddy?

493
01:04:04,392 --> 01:04:08,021
Four hours. They're looking for him
all over town, Frank.

494
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:12,609
They've staked out the docks, the airport,
to keep him from leaving the country.

495
01:04:13,193 --> 01:04:15,195
Anyone else trying for a hit?

496
01:04:15,987 --> 01:04:17,948
Haven't heard of any such likelihood.

497
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:19,991
What about his brother, Pete?

498
01:04:20,075 --> 01:04:21,576
In the clear.

499
01:04:23,245 --> 01:04:25,038
Okay, Eddy. Thanks.

500
01:04:25,789 --> 01:04:28,500
- Anything I can do for you?
- There is something.

501
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:31,878
Remember Zash-Zhoe?
They gave him three to five.

502
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:35,215
- What is he in for?
- Receiving stolen property.

503
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:37,426
I'll try.

504
01:04:37,968 --> 01:04:39,219
Thanks, Frank.

505
01:05:02,284 --> 01:05:05,370
- Here you go.
- Take care, Lieutenant.

506
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,627
What the hell is going on here?

507
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:20,337
A high-speed pursuit.

508
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:24,216
Two men are killed. An officer in the
hospital. A witness almost murdered.

509
01:16:24,299 --> 01:16:27,302
I want to know what's happening now.
Let's hear it straight.

510
01:16:27,385 --> 01:16:28,845
Here's a report.

511
01:16:30,931 --> 01:16:34,601
A man like Chalmers
could be a great help to the Department.

512
01:16:35,352 --> 01:16:37,938
He could speak for us where it counts.

513
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:40,524
He could fight for us in the legislature.

514
01:16:40,982 --> 01:16:43,693
You have got to turn over his witness.

515
01:16:45,445 --> 01:16:46,822
Where's Ross?

516
01:16:49,574 --> 01:16:51,618
Tell him. That's an order.

517
01:16:55,664 --> 01:16:57,082
He's dead.

518
01:16:57,332 --> 01:16:59,543
- Dead?
- He died last night.

519
01:17:00,085 --> 01:17:01,503
After you moved him?

520
01:17:01,586 --> 01:17:05,048
Before. I've got him downstairs
under a John Doe.

521
01:17:07,509 --> 01:17:09,010
You are sick.

522
01:17:10,303 --> 01:17:13,140
Smuggling a dead man out of a hospital.

523
01:17:14,307 --> 01:17:17,686
And now two men killed,
who may have had nothing to do with it.

524
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:20,272
The man I was chasing killed Ross.

525
01:17:20,355 --> 01:17:22,357
How do you know? Did you see him?

526
01:17:22,441 --> 01:17:25,152
Yes. He tried to nail me with a shotgun.

527
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,028
A Winchester pump.

528
01:17:30,323 --> 01:17:33,994
The radio report said the two men
were burned beyond recognition.

529
01:17:35,036 --> 01:17:39,374
Now all he's got are two dead men.
It would never hold up in court.

530
01:17:41,126 --> 01:17:43,962
I've got one lead. I want to move on it.

531
01:17:48,425 --> 01:17:52,179
"Miss Dorothy Simmons.
Thunderbolt Hotel. San Mateo."

532
01:17:52,888 --> 01:17:56,349
Ross called her person-to-person
from a phone in Union Square...

533
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:59,061
approximately nine hours
before he was killed.

534
01:17:59,144 --> 01:18:02,064
So he called his girlfriend.
What does that prove?

535
01:18:12,532 --> 01:18:17,079
This is Sunday. I'm going to hold that writ
until we come to work Monday morning.

536
01:18:36,181 --> 01:18:37,641
Go on. Get out.

537
01:18:53,156 --> 01:18:54,282
I need a car.

538
01:18:54,366 --> 01:18:56,952
Sorry, Lieutenant, there's no cars left.

539
01:20:02,309 --> 01:20:05,312
- Ms. Simmons doesn't answer.
- What's her room number?

540
01:20:05,395 --> 01:20:08,065
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to give...

541
01:20:08,148 --> 01:20:11,485
Front. Take this gentleman
to Room 114, please.

542
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:48,248
Hello, Del?

543
01:21:52,169 --> 01:21:54,087
It's a strangulation.

544
01:23:28,181 --> 01:23:30,016
I thought I knew you.

545
01:23:30,726 --> 01:23:33,061
But I'm not so sure anymore.

546
01:23:34,855 --> 01:23:38,650
Do you let anything reach you?
I mean, really reach you?

547
01:23:40,068 --> 01:23:43,947
Or are you so used to it by now
that nothing really touches you?

548
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:46,241
You're living in a sewer, Frank.

549
01:23:46,324 --> 01:23:48,118
Day after day.

550
01:23:50,162 --> 01:23:53,832
That's where half of it is.
And you can't walk away from it.

551
01:23:53,915 --> 01:23:57,919
I know it's there, but I don't have to
be reminded of the whole thing.

552
01:23:58,003 --> 01:24:00,046
The ugliness around us.

553
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:05,051
With you, living with violence is a way
of life. Living with violence and death.

554
01:24:11,641 --> 01:24:15,771
How can you be part of it without
becoming more and more callous?

555
01:24:20,484 --> 01:24:23,403
Your world is so far from the one I know.

556
01:24:29,951 --> 01:24:32,454
What will happen to us in time?

557
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:38,585
Time starts now.

558
01:24:50,305 --> 01:24:52,265
- What've you got?
- Let's start with the cleaver.

559
01:24:52,349 --> 01:24:56,186
One cleaver,
approximately 8 inches in length.

560
01:24:57,145 --> 01:25:00,065
Ms. Simmons' luggage
has just arrived from the airport.

561
01:25:00,148 --> 01:25:02,567
Okay. Where is it?

562
01:25:04,736 --> 01:25:07,030
- Here you go.
- One pair of gold shoes...

563
01:25:07,114 --> 01:25:10,075
- Where is it from?
- San Mateo Thunderbolt Hotel.

564
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:11,952
- And who from?
- Simmons.

565
01:25:12,035 --> 01:25:13,495
And what do we have?

566
01:25:13,578 --> 01:25:18,041
One yellow metal locket,
yellow metal watch, pearl necklace.

567
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:20,919
- Put a hold on these.
- Yes, sir.

568
01:25:51,366 --> 01:25:53,118
We got a man here.

569
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:01,752
Dearborn Travel Agency, Chicago. Rome.

570
01:26:03,336 --> 01:26:05,589
Look at all this literature.

571
01:26:06,047 --> 01:26:07,549
- Rome?
- Yeah.

572
01:26:10,927 --> 01:26:14,347
What do you make out of that?
I thought she was alone.

573
01:26:15,348 --> 01:26:17,184
She's got a guy now.

574
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:26,818
New purse, still got a price tag in it.

575
01:26:38,663 --> 01:26:40,499
Give me a bag, Tony.

576
01:26:52,302 --> 01:26:55,263
Everything is new.
They weren't even away.

577
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:01,728
Passport? No passport. No tickets.

578
01:27:01,895 --> 01:27:04,773
Yeah, I haven't found any tickets, either.

579
01:27:14,324 --> 01:27:15,534
Bingo.

580
01:27:17,452 --> 01:27:19,162
What've you got?

581
01:27:19,663 --> 01:27:20,872
Great.

582
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:25,627
"Albert E. Renick."

583
01:27:27,504 --> 01:27:29,673
Then who the hell is Simmons?

584
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,970
Look how much money he's got.
Look at this.

585
01:27:40,892 --> 01:27:42,561
This guy is loaded.

586
01:27:43,353 --> 01:27:46,857
- We've got a Renick.
- Whoever Renick is.

587
01:27:49,943 --> 01:27:52,028
Look what I came up with.

588
01:27:54,573 --> 01:27:56,116
Dorothy Renick.

589
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,910
Okay. Drop it in.

590
01:28:01,037 --> 01:28:03,165
We're getting warm. "A.R."

591
01:28:03,832 --> 01:28:05,876
How does that grab you?

592
01:28:09,212 --> 01:28:12,758
Give me a bag, Tony.
Fingerprints on this stuff.

593
01:28:18,138 --> 01:28:19,848
Let's wrap it up.

594
01:28:30,275 --> 01:28:32,110
- Thanks, Tony.
- Okay.

595
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:35,697
No ticket, no passport.

596
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,914
Call Immigration in Chicago. Have them
wire Renick's passport applications.

597
01:28:43,997 --> 01:28:46,917
- I'll get a fingerprint check on Ross.
- Okay.

598
01:28:48,668 --> 01:28:51,838
There are multiple gunshot wounds
on the left side of the face...

599
01:28:51,922 --> 01:28:55,342
the left side of the neck,
and about the left upper thorax.

600
01:28:55,425 --> 01:28:58,595
These extend from the lateral extent
of the left eye...

601
01:28:58,678 --> 01:29:01,473
and a portion of the left orbit
has been lacerated...

602
01:29:01,556 --> 01:29:04,851
and aqueous humor
protrudes from the laceration.

603
01:29:05,102 --> 01:29:08,146
There have been deep lacerations
in the immediate area...

604
01:29:08,230 --> 01:29:11,817
and these have been approximated
by fine surgical sutures.

605
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:15,487
There are multiple surgical incisions
about the left side of the face.

606
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:18,323
There is considerable hemorrhage
in these deep tissues...

607
01:29:18,407 --> 01:29:21,827
and a number of surgical sutures
are present about this area.

608
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:24,913
There are entrances into the sinuses...

609
01:29:24,996 --> 01:29:28,250
and several pellets are found
located within this area.

610
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:32,379
There are also multiple lacerations
and multiple gunshot entrance wounds...

611
01:29:32,462 --> 01:29:34,131
about the left side of the neck.

612
01:29:34,214 --> 01:29:37,551
And similar wounds are found
on the left upper thorax.

613
01:29:37,634 --> 01:29:38,927
Period. The lacerations...

614
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:41,972
Could you send up
those prints right away?

615
01:29:44,349 --> 01:29:49,521
There's a soft rubber catheter extending
out through the lateral extent of the...

616
01:29:59,865 --> 01:30:03,118
I understand Capt. Bennet told you,
you had until Monday morning...

617
01:30:03,201 --> 01:30:05,454
to comply with my writ of habeas corpus.

618
01:30:05,537 --> 01:30:07,414
However, I want a signed admission now...

619
01:30:07,497 --> 01:30:10,417
that Ross died
while he was in your custody.

620
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:13,128
When I'm ready. Yes?

621
01:30:13,211 --> 01:30:17,215
- Your photographs are coming through.
- I'll be right up. Thank you.

622
01:30:17,299 --> 01:30:20,343
I demand that signed statement. Now.

623
01:30:22,846 --> 01:30:24,181
Excuse me.

624
01:30:49,664 --> 01:30:51,374
Is that the girl?

625
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:53,752
Yeah.

626
01:32:03,238 --> 01:32:04,531
Ross.

627
01:32:04,614 --> 01:32:06,616
"Albert Edward Renick.

628
01:32:07,033 --> 01:32:09,202
"Used car salesman. Chicago."

629
01:32:10,871 --> 01:32:12,497
Who's Renick?

630
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:15,000
He was the man who was shot
at the Hotel Daniels.

631
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:18,211
You sent us to guard the wrong man,
Mr. Chalmers.

632
01:32:28,889 --> 01:32:30,849
Mrs. Dorothy Renick and Mr. Al Renick...

633
01:32:30,932 --> 01:32:33,226
have reservations
on the 7:00 flight to Rome.

634
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:35,187
Separate tickets. Not confirmed.

635
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:37,147
And I got this report from Chicago.

636
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:40,650
Renick has no record of arrests.
He's clean, Frank.

637
01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:45,280
Well, Ross took close to $2 million
from the Organization.

638
01:32:45,363 --> 01:32:48,325
And he set Renick up
to get the heat off of him.

639
01:32:48,408 --> 01:32:51,495
Then he killed Renick's wife to shut her up.

640
01:33:36,373 --> 01:33:38,417
San Francisco Homicide.

641
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,962
Do you have a Mr. Renick
on the 7:00 flight for Rome?

642
01:33:42,045 --> 01:33:45,048
- He confirmed his flight a half hour ago.
- Did he check in yet?

643
01:33:45,132 --> 01:33:48,343
Not here, but he could do that at the gate.
Shall I call security?

644
01:33:48,427 --> 01:33:51,930
No, call the gate.
Have them recheck all the passports.

645
01:33:52,013 --> 01:33:54,141
- Which gate?
- Seventy-three.

646
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:04,776
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

647
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:07,946
<i>Clipper Flight 110
is now ready for boarding.</i>

648
01:34:08,572 --> 01:34:12,951
<i>We hope you have a pleasant flight,
and thank you for choosing Pan American.</i>

649
01:34:13,034 --> 01:34:15,579
<i>No smoking, please, beyond this point.</i>

650
01:34:15,662 --> 01:34:19,082
<i>Would you please have your passports
available for inspection...</i>

651
01:34:19,166 --> 01:34:21,752
<i>as you pass through the departure gate?</i>

652
01:34:38,143 --> 01:34:39,478
Excuse me.

653
01:35:16,014 --> 01:35:17,391
Pardon me.

654
01:35:28,527 --> 01:35:30,195
Step right here.

655
01:35:30,487 --> 01:35:34,699
And you're with the tour, too, are you?
There are other girls ahead of you.

656
01:35:34,783 --> 01:35:36,618
Step right on through.

657
01:36:27,210 --> 01:36:29,880
- Passenger Service.
- Can I help you, sir?

658
01:36:29,963 --> 01:36:34,384
Do you have a Renick, an Al E. Renick
on Flight 124 to London?

659
01:36:40,682 --> 01:36:41,850
What?

660
01:36:42,934 --> 01:36:47,230
Thank you. At the last minute,
on a Rome ticket. Flight Control.

661
01:37:26,686 --> 01:37:30,524
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have just
been instructed to return to the gate.</i>

662
01:37:30,607 --> 01:37:32,651
<i>For your safety, please remain seated...</i>

663
01:37:32,734 --> 01:37:35,320
<i>until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop.</i>

664
01:37:35,404 --> 01:37:37,823
<i>We anticipate only a short delay.</i>

665
01:37:37,906 --> 01:37:40,951
<i>However, all passengers are requested
to disembark...</i>

666
01:37:41,034 --> 01:37:44,121
<i>and remain in the departure lounge.
Thank you.</i>

667
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:37,340
He's still my witness.

668
01:38:37,758 --> 01:38:42,054
I'll be delighted to let you have him
after he testifies tomorrow.

669
01:38:57,903 --> 01:38:59,571
The Organization.

670
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,074
Several murders.

671
01:39:02,616 --> 01:39:04,659
Could do us both a great deal of good.

672
01:39:04,743 --> 01:39:08,663
Look, Chalmers, let's understand
each other. I don't like you.

673
01:39:09,456 --> 01:39:12,334
Come on now, don't be naive, Lieutenant.

674
01:39:12,542 --> 01:39:15,045
We both know how careers are made.

675
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:17,506
Integrity is something you sell
the public.

676
01:39:17,589 --> 01:39:21,426
You sell whatever you want,
but don't sell it here tonight.

677
01:39:22,594 --> 01:39:24,638
Frank, we must all compromise.

678
01:39:24,721 --> 01:39:26,264
Bullshit!

679
01:39:29,601 --> 01:39:31,978
Get the hell out of here, now.

680
01:41:04,029 --> 01:41:05,363
Thank you.

- How long will we be delayed?
- Just about 45 minutes.

682
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,104
Won't be long.

683
01:44:14,219 --> 01:44:15,804
Get me the security guard.

684
01:50:00,607 --> 01:50:01,900
Ticket, please.

685
01:50:25,215 --> 01:50:26,967
All right. Get back.

686
01:51:02,961 --> 01:51:05,630
Wonder who he was, what he did.

687
01:51:10,594 --> 01:51:12,679
I heard his shots all the way down the hall.

688
01:51:12,763 --> 01:51:14,097
He's a cop, that's what he is.

689
01:51:14,181 --> 01:51:17,267
Let's get back. Let's keep the area clear.

690
01:51:18,518 --> 01:51:20,771
Come, ladies,
you don't want to see this now.

691
