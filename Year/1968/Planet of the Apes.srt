1
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:24,315
And that completes my final report
until we reach touchdown.

2
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,194
We're now on full automatic,
in the hands of the computers.

3
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,155
I've tucked my crew in for the long sleep

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,241
and I'll be joining them

5
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,201
soon.

6
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:39,497
In less than an hour we'll finish
our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy.

7
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:42,083
Six months in deep space.

8
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,294
By our time, that is.

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,796
According to Dr. Hasslein's theory

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,426
of time in a vehicle
traveling nearly the speed of light,

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,638
the Earth has aged
nearly 700 years since we left it,

12
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,849
while we've aged hardly at all.

13
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,812
It may be so.

14
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,981
This much is probably true.

15
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,277
The men who sent us on this journey
are long since dead and gone.

16
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,364
You who are reading me now
are a different breed.

17
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,992
I hope a better one.

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,662
I leave the 20th century
with no regrets, but...

19
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,372
one more thing.

20
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,625
If anybody's listening, that is.

21
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,295
Nothing scientific. It's... purely personal.

22
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,923
Seen from out here,

23
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,968
everything seems different.

24
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,179
Time bends.

25
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,931
Space is... boundless.

26
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,726
It squashes a man's ego.

27
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,897
I feel lonely.

28
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,823
That's about it.

29
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,911
Tell me, though...

30
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,539
Does man, that marvel of the universe,

31
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:07,418
that glorious paradox
who has sent me to the stars,

32
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,213
still make war against his brother,

33
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,592
keep his neighbor's children starving?

34
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,895
Are you all right?

35
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:30,658
Stewart?

36
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,096
We're in the soup!

37
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,766
She's sinking!
Dodge, read the atmosphere!

38
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,451
Landon, get out a last signal!

39
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,703
What signal?

40
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,914
To Earth! That we've landed!

41
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,333
The air's OK!

42
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,253
Blow the hatch
before we lose all our power!

43
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,930
It's no use! The power's gone!

44
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,016
Forget it! Abandon ship!

45
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,457
She's sinking.

46
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:15,382
Going...

47
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,845
Gone.

48
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,101
OK. We're here to stay.

49
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,201
Well, where are we?

50
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,370
Do you have any notion, skipper?

51
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,539
We're some 320 light years from Earth

52
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:52,753
on an unnamed planet in orbit
around a star in the constellation of Orion.

53
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,964
Is that close enough for you?

54
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,676
That could be Bellatrix.

55
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,095
It's too white for Bellatrix.

56
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,223
You didn't have time to read the tapes.

57
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,017
So you really don't know, do you?

58
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,186
What went wrong?

59
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,022
We weren't
programmed to land in the water.

60
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,110
The question is not so much
where we are as when we are.

61
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,738
We've had enough sleep
to hold us for a while.

62
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,408
Let's start earning all that back pay.

63
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,698
Dodge, run your soil test.

64
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,786
- Got your sensors?
- Right.

65
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,997
- Geiger counter?
- Got it.

66
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,252
Let's see. One pistol,

67
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:20,382
20 rounds ammo, a medical kit,
camera, TX9.

68
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,678
We've got food and water
enough for three days.

69
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,847
How long is a day?

70
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,016
That's a good question.

71
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,559
Landon!

72
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,644
Hey, Landon!

73
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,813
Join the expedition.

74
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:41,528
Sorry. I was thinking about Stewart.
What do you suppose happened?

75
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,697
Air leak. She died in her sleep.

76
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,033
You don't seem very cut up about it.

77
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,703
It's a little late for a wake.
She's been dead nearly a year.

78
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:53,374
That means we've been away
from Earth for 18 months.

79
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,542
Our time.

80
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,837
You've gone gray.

81
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:05,219
Apart from that you look pretty chipper
for a man who's 2,031 years old.

82
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:09,139
I read the clocks.
They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.

83
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,810
We have been away from Earth
for 2,000 years,

84
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,978
give or take a decade.

85
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,815
Still can't accept it?

86
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,235
Time's wiped out
everything you ever knew.

87
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,362
It's all dust.

88
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,531
Prove it.

89
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,409
If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.

90
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:32,329
It's a fact, Landon.
Buy it. You'll sleep better.

91
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:37,292
Nothing will grow here.
There's just a trace of carbohydrates.

92
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,337
All the nitrogen is locked into the nitrates.

93
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,506
No dangerous ionization?

94
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,675
No.

95
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,552
Well...

96
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:51,014
If there's no life here,
we've got just 72 hours to find it.

97
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,101
That's when the groceries run out.
Let's go.

98
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,270
Which direction?

99
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,440
That way.

100
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,733
Any particular reason?

101
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,902
None at all.

102
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,991
Come on...

103
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,662
Everybody all right?

104
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,915
Water check.

105
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,716
Eight ounces.

106
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,892
It doesn't add up.

107
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,227
Thunder and lightning, and no rain.

108
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,396
Cloud cover at night.

109
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,399
That strange luminosity...
yet there's no moon.

110
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,568
If we could just get a fix.

111
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,986
What would that tell you?

112
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,197
I've told you where you are
and when you are.

113
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,074
All right, all right.

114
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,869
You're 300 light years
from your precious planet.

115
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:45,666
Your loved ones are dead
and forgotten for 20 centuries.

116
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,167
20!

117
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:51,004
Even if you could get back, they'd think
you were something that fell out of a tree.

118
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,090
Taylor, quit riding him.

119
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,134
There is just one reality.
We are here and it is now.

120
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,054
You get hold of that,
or you might as well be dead.

121
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,139
I'm prepared to die.

122
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,520
He's prepared to die.

123
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,814
Doesn't that make you misty?

124
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,942
Chalk up another victory
for the human spirit.

125
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:24,121
Clue me in on something, will you?
Why did you sign on for this trip?

126
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,289
You volunteered. Why?

127
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,458
Never mind. I'll clue you in.

128
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,878
You were
the golden boy of the class of '72.

129
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,632
When they nominated you for the big one,
you couldn't turn it down.

130
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,552
Not without losing
your all-American image.

131
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,554
Climb off, will you?

132
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,348
Oh, and the glory. Don't forget that.

133
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:47,853
There's a life-size bronze statue of you
standing out there somewhere.

134
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,815
It's probably turned green by now
and nobody can read the nameplate.

135
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,276
But never let it be said
that we forget our heroes.

136
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,820
Taylor, I'm telling you
to climb off my back.

137
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,405
And there's one last item.

138
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,325
Immortality.
You wanted to live for ever, didn't you?

139
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,494
Well, you damn near made it.

140
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,166
Except for me and Dodge,
you've lived longer than anyone ever born.

141
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,086
And with our
lovely Lieutenant Stewart dead,

142
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:16,006
it looks like you're the last of the line.

143
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,510
You got what you wanted, tiger.
How does it taste?

144
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,972
OK. You read me well enough.

145
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,141
But why can't I read you?

146
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,310
Don't bother.

147
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,812
Dodge, there. He's not like me at all.

148
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,523
But he makes sense.

149
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,067
He'd walk naked into a live volcano

150
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:40,280
if he thought he could learn something
that no other man knew.

151
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,824
But you... You're no seeker.

152
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,993
You're negative.

153
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:49,331
- And I'm not prepared to die.
- I'd like to know why not.

154
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,999
You thought life on Earth
was meaningless.

155
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,627
You despised people.

156
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,796
So what did you do? You ran out.

157
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,381
No, no. It's not like that, Landon.

158
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,842
I'm a seeker too.

159
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,220
But my dreams aren't like yours.

160
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,389
I can't help thinking
somewhere in the universe

161
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:09,976
there has to be something
better than man. Has to be.

162
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,356
Taylor, over here!

163
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,771
Life.

164
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,038
Where there's one, there's another.

165
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,624
And another and another.

166
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,793
Let's find 'em.

167
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,533
Skipper!

168
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,619
Look!

169
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,429
Scarecrows?

170
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,348
Let's see.

171
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,271
To hell with the scarecrows!

172
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,689
Taylor!

173
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,816
Look at this.

174
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,718
Taylor, look!

175
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,367
They didn't leave much, did they?

176
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,442
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.

177
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,695
Blessed are the vegetarians.

178
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,787
They look more or less human,

179
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,955
but I think they're mute.

180
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,051
We got off at the wrong stop.

181
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,389
You're supposed to be
the optimist, Landon.

182
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,140
Look on the bright side.

183
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:56,854
If this is the best they've got around here,
in six months we'll be running this planet.

184
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,366
Smile.

185
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,117
Which one was wearing
the strange clothes?

186
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,245
This one.

187
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,999
Will he live?

188
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,501
I don't know.

189
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,004
This beast has lost a lot of blood.

190
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,138
There's no probe here. Find one!

191
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,307
Yes, sir.

192
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,434
This place is dirty, doctor.

193
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:14,106
Doctor, these animals are dirty. They stink
and they carry communicable diseases.

194
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:17,526
Why aren't they cleaned up
before they're brought here?

195
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,612
You don't sound happy in your work.

196
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,740
I'm little more than a vet
in this laboratory.

197
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,826
You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius
about me.

198
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:29,538
I did. You know how
he looks down his nose at chimpanzees.

199
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,208
But the quota system's been abolished.

200
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,628
- You made it. Why can't I?
- What do you mean - made it?

201
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,465
I'm an animal psychologist, that's all.
We have no authority.

202
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,927
You do all right when it comes to
getting space and equipment.

203
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:46,680
That's because Dr. Zaius
realizes our work has value.

204
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:51,560
The foundations of scientific brain surgery
are being laid right here

205
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,563
in studies of cerebral functions
of these animals.

206
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,317
They're still dirty, doctor.

207
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,362
And their bite is septic.
There. Look at that.

208
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,907
Hold his jaw.

209
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,685
- Good morning, Dr. Zira.
- Good morning, Julius.

210
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,271
- How's our patient today?
- No change.

211
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,023
The minute you open the door,
he goes into his act.

212
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,528
Well!

213
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,738
And what do we want this morning?

214
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,449
Do we want something? Come on. Speak.

215
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,993
Come on.

216
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,369
Speak.

217
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,830
Do we want some sugar, old-timer?

218
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,710
You could get hurt doing that, doctor.

219
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,212
Oh, don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.

220
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:03,340
They're all tame
until they take a chunk out of you.

221
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,802
Well, Bright Eyes.
Is our throat feeling better?

222
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,930
Still hurts, doesn't it?

223
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,058
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.

224
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,231
That Bright Eyes is remarkable.

225
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,817
He keeps trying to form words.

226
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,653
You know what they say.
Human see, human do.

227
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,535
Now what?

228
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,290
He seems to want something.

229
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,002
I'd be careful, doctor.

230
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,337
What did I tell you?

231
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,006
Try that again and I'll break your arm!

232
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,844
Good morning, Your Excellency.

233
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,013
Dr. Zaius.

234
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,892
Good morning, sir.

235
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,603
Open up, please.

236
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,772
I'm so glad you could come.

237
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,982
Sir, he's over here.

238
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,403
Bright Eyes...

239
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,156
Show him. Go ahead.

240
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,325
Do your trick.

241
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,826
Speak.

242
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,037
Go on. Speak again.

243
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,709
There! Can you believe it?

244
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,878
Yes, amusing.

245
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,047
A man acting like an ape.

246
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:31,512
Dr. Zaius,
I could swear he's answering you.

247
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,431
He has a definite gift for mimicry.

248
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,850
Most unusual.

249
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,561
He's using that old blanket as clothing.

250
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:44,900
I wonder how he'd score
on a Hopkins manual dexterity test.

251
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,236
An animal?

252
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,362
Look!

253
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,531
He's moving his fingers.

254
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,033
Only because he saw you moving yours.

255
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,995
But perhaps he understood.

256
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,456
Man has no understanding.

257
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,668
He can be taught a few simple tricks.
Nothing more.

258
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,547
I'm afraid I must disagree.

259
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:10,968
- According to my experiments...
- Dr. Zira, I must caution you.

260
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:15,264
Experimental brain surgery
on these creatures is one thing,

261
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,433
and I'm all in favor of it.

262
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:21,687
But your behavioral studies
are something else again.

263
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:26,775
To suggest that we can learn anything
about the simian nature

264
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,403
from the study of man is sheer nonsense.

265
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,656
Besides, man is a nuisance.

266
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:36,243
He eats up his food supplies in the forest,

267
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,789
then migrates to our green belts
and ravages our crops.

268
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,754
The sooner he is exterminated the better.

269
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,799
It's a question of simian survival.

270
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,481
Is this the one you wanted, doctor?

271
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,734
Oh, yes. Thank you.

272
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:12,404
Bright Eyes, I've got a present for you.

273
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,750
Put her in with him.

274
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,514
Cornelius! Up here.

275
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,059
Do you have to work tonight?

276
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,394
No.

277
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,563
Neither do I.

278
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:34,278
Oh, Cornelius.

279
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,045
There's Bright Eyes.

280
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,923
The one I was telling you about.

281
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:57,718
What's so special about him?

282
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,303
Watch.

283
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,846
Hello, Bright Eyes.

284
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,015
How's our throat today?

285
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,023
- Look! She remembers!
- Remembers what?

286
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,192
The blood transfusion.

287
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:14,651
Zira, really!

288
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,862
You know, they can't... Watch out.

289
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,780
Here comes number one.

290
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,449
Something's bothering him.

291
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:24,161
He's been prying around the lab
for the last two days.

292
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,330
Good morning, Dr. Zaius.

293
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:30,459
- You know my... Dr. Cornelius, my fiancé.
- Of course.

294
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,752
The young ape with a shovel.

295
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,589
I hear you're planning
another archaeological expedition.

296
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,885
- With the Academy's approval, sir.
- The project will require my support.

297
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,054
I hope I may count on it, sir.

298
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,806
Cornelius, a friendly warning.

299
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:49,853
As you dig for artifacts,
be sure you don't bury your reputation.

300
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:07,204
Guard!

301
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,602
Stop!

302
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,980
You'll hurt him!

303
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,148
Take him inside.

304
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,655
Cornelius! Cornelius,
if you have a moment today,

305
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,784
I'd like to discuss
this expedition of yours in more detail.

306
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,913
Certainly, sir. I'll pick up my notes
and I'll come right over.

307
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,708
I don't understand
these animal psychologists.

308
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,502
What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?

309
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,672
That man can be domesticated.

310
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,839
- What happened?
- Oh, those fools and their torches.

311
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,383
- Do you have any ointment?
- I'll see.

312
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,599
I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.

313
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:57,439
Julius!

314
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:02,569
I told you what you'd get!

315
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,029
Julius, don't, don't, don't!

316
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,822
It doesn't matter!

317
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:07,991
Julius, don't hurt him!

318
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:11,953
Julius!

319
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,462
Natural-born thieves, aren't they?

320
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:36,311
Get me a collar and leash.

321
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:39,981
- I'm taking him out of here.
- He's vicious, doctor.

322
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,110
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- Do as I say!

323
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:58,792
You... you wouldn't hurt me, would you,

324
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:02,129
Taylor?

325
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,314
It's a stunt.

326
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,483
Humans can't write.

327
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,652
Dear, you're a scientist.

328
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,821
Don't you believe your own eyes?

329
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,494
Where did you learn to do this?

330
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,541
"Jefferson

331
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,586
Public School."

332
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,594
"Fort Wayne,

333
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,762
Indiana."

334
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:58,351
Back on that planet
you say you came from?

335
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,943
Maybe he is intelligent.

336
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,613
But he is also... crazy.

337
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,573
Cornelius.

338
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,742
Cornelius, please.

339
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:21,249
"Dodge was killed in the hunt."

340
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:24,586
"What happened to... Landon?"

341
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,882
I don't know.

342
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,760
They fell out of the sky with you?

343
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:38,266
"Not fell. Flew."

344
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:40,894
Flight is a scientific impossibility.

345
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,189
And even if it weren't, why fly?

346
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,358
Where would it get you?

347
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,252
"Do you have maps?"

348
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:22,936
We're here. You were captured here.

349
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,524
You fell into the water here?

350
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,527
You came ashore...

351
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,696
Marched across the desert?

352
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,740
Mountains?

353
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,618
Many days and nights.

354
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,329
And reached the jungle.

355
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:43,915
Out of the question.

356
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:49,045
Cornelius, why do you insist
on provoking him?

357
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:54,634
No creature can survive in the forbidden
zone. I know. I've been there. I've seen it.

358
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,264
"Then how do you account for me?"

359
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,100
I don't.

360
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,269
And I'm not going to try.

361
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:09,357
But what about your theory?

362
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,695
The existence of someone
like Taylor might prove it.

363
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:16,072
Do you want to get my head chopped off?

364
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:19,951
Don't be foolish.
If it's true, they'll have to accept it.

365
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:22,120
No, they won't.

366
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,291
Cornelius has developed
the most brilliant hypothesis.

367
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,501
But I'm probably wrong.

368
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:32,088
That the ape evolved from
a lower order of primate,

369
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,299
possibly man.

370
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,843
In his trip to the forbidden zone,

371
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:41,181
he discovered traces
of a culture older than recorded time.

372
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:45,018
- The evidence was very meager.
- You didn't think so then.

373
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:49,397
That was before Dr. Zaius and half
of the Academy said my idea was heresy.

374
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,067
How can scientific truth be heresy?

375
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:55,695
What if Taylor is exactly
the proof you needed?

376
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,864
A mutation.

377
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,951
A missing link between
the unevolved primate

378
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,745
and the ape.

379
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,707
Touchy, isn't he?

380
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,211
"I am not a missing link."

381
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:16,341
Well, if he were a missing link, the sacred
scrolls wouldn't be worth their parchment.

382
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,135
Well, maybe they're not.

383
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,431
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not going to get into that battle.

384
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:27,310
- Cornelius, show some strength!
- Zira, listen to me!

385
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:29,771
Now, we both have fine futures.

386
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,023
Marriage, stimulating careers.

387
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:34,192
I'm up for a raise.

388
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:37,153
Dr. Zaius.

389
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,449
Did you
forget our appointment, Cornelius?

390
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,119
No, sir. I was just collecting my notes.

391
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:48,540
You know Dr. Maximus, of course.
Our commissioner for animal affairs.

392
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,376
Yes, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.

393
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,545
What is that?

394
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,714
A man, Dr. Maximus.

395
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:59,342
I know it's a man. And you know the rules.

396
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,803
No animals allowed
outside the compound,

397
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,472
and most especially not without a leash.

398
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,641
Yes, sir, but... but this

399
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,644
creature is a special case.

400
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:12,105
Why special?

401
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,482
We're conducting a new experiment.

402
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,944
Wouldn't that more properly be done
in your office?

403
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,654
Yes, sir.

404
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,991
Guards, return this beast
to the compound.

405
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,493
What is this?

406
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:30,665
A toy.

407
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,834
It floats on the air.

408
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,586
Zira...

409
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,962
Try it.

410
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,131
Nonsense.

411
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:59,277
- What's up, lieutenant?
- We're taking number four to surgery.

412
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,321
- Have him ready.
- How come?

413
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:05,617
- The beast's throat's nearly healed.
- The vet's going to geld him.

414
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:09,329
Dr. Zira won't like it.
She wants that pair to mate.

415
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:14,417
These orders come from Dr. Zaius himself.
There's nothing she can do about it.

416
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:32,560
If only you knew what they're going to do.

417
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,315
Stay still now. Don't give me any trouble.

418
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,978
Weep if you must,
but make an end of sorrow.

419
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,146
He lives again.

420
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,317
Yes, he has found peace in heaven.

421
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:27,782
He was a model for us all,
a gorilla to remember...

422
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,202
Hunter, warrior,

423
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:33,371
defender of the faith.

424
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,457
Cherished husband,

425
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,626
beloved father,

426
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,337
generous master, yes.

427
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,631
He was

428
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:46,050
a font of simian kindness.

429
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:54,601
The dear departed once said to me
"I never met an ape I didn't like."

430
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:57,979
Look! It's a man!

431
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,149
In heaven's name! Get rid of that creature!

432
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,318
Catch him!

433
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,989
Catch him! Catch him!

434
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,123
Come on, Quintus.

435
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,340
- Go get him!
- Taylor!

436
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,717
- Why did you run away?
- Security police.

437
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,886
I'm in charge of this man.

438
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,597
He is in the custody
of the ministry of science.

439
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:04,559
Take your stinking paws off me,

440
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:07,019
you damn dirty ape!

441
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,031
No one'll listen to me.

442
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,411
Only you.

443
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:28,291
You.

444
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,294
Nova.

445
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,921
You... Nova.

446
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,090
No...

447
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,261
Yeah. Me Tarzan, you Jane.

448
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:50,688
What are you doing?

449
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,148
Leave her alone,

450
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,357
damn you!

451
01:00:53,442 --> 01:01:07,121
Where are you taking her?

452
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:23,888
Damn you! You hairy scum!

453
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:26,098
Shut up, you freak!

454
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,059
Julius, you...

455
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,852
I said shut up!

456
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:31,729
It's a madhouse!

457
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,732
A madhouse!

458
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,288
Now I don't even have you.

459
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,084
Imagine me needing someone.

460
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:57,129
Back on Earth I never did.
Oh, there were women. Lots of women.

461
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:00,341
Lots of... lovemaking, but no love.

462
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:03,386
That was the kind of world we'd made.

463
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,554
So I left

464
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,516
because there was no one
to hold me there.

465
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,685
Did I tell you about Stewart?

466
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,479
Now there was a lovely girl.

467
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,440
The most precious cargo
we'd brought along.

468
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:20,027
She was... to be the new Eve.

469
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,781
With our hot and eager help, of course.

470
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,536
Probably just as well
she didn't make it this far.

471
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,208
Do you love me, I wonder?

472
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,837
Can you love, I wonder?

473
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,470
Well...

474
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,765
You're not as smart as Stewart, but

475
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,934
you're the only girl in town.

476
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:00,151
Look at that. I...

477
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,445
I taught you to smile.

478
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:30,533
It's been weeks.
What happened? Where have you been?

479
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:32,701
Why didn't you come to see me?

480
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,870
- What is this?
- A hearing.

481
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:37,456
- Be clever. Be quiet.
- All rise!

482
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:48,175
Be seated!

483
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:54,890
This ad hoc tribunal of
the National Academy is now in session.

484
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,601
The president of the Academy presiding.

485
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:02,606
On my right, Dr. Maximus, commissioner
for animal affairs. And on my left,

486
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:07,653
Dr. Zaius, minister of science
and chief defender of the faith.

487
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:12,116
And appearing for the state,
Dr. Honorious, deputy minister ofjustice.

488
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:20,207
Bailiff! Your instructions:
To clean up the beast.

489
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:25,588
These rags he's wearing give off a stench
that's offensive to the dignity

490
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:28,090
of this tribunal.

491
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,434
You may proceed,

492
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,687
- Dr. Honorious.
- By your leave, Mr. President,

493
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:46,025
this tribunal has not yet defined
the purpose for this inquiry.

494
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:51,238
You asked for the opportunity
to present your case.

495
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,741
Surely you must know why you're here.

496
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,494
At the very least,
this man has the right to know

497
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,829
whether there's a charge against him.

498
01:05:58,914 --> 01:05:59,955
Objection!

499
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,042
This exhibit is indeed a man.

500
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,753
Therefore he has no rights under ape law.

501
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,089
Dr. Zira, this is a man,

502
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:13,385
- is it not?
- He is unlike any man you have ever seen.

503
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,596
As we hope to prove.

504
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,016
Answer the question, Dr. Zira. Is it a man?

505
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,978
Sir, perhaps the... question
is the point at issue.

506
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:25,689
Is he a man, is he a deviant,

507
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:27,858
or... a freak of nature?

508
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:30,027
- Objection!
- Sustained.

509
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,280
Now, Dr. Zira, in all fairness,

510
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,200
you must admit that
the accused is a non-ape

511
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,994
and therefore has no rights under ape law.

512
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:41,205
Then why is he called the accused?

513
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:44,458
Your Honors must think him
guilty of something.

514
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:51,298
The creature's not being tried.
He's being disposed of.

515
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:55,094
It is scientific heresy
that is being tried here.

516
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,221
Well put, Dr. Zaius.

517
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:59,765
Let us warn our friends

518
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:04,019
that they endanger their own careers
by defending this animal.

519
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:07,481
Then I'll... defend myself.

520
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:13,821
Dr. Zira, would you tell

521
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,198
Bright Eyes to be quiet?

522
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:19,034
- My name is Taylor!
- Bailiff! Silence the animal!

523
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:22,454
Wait! Let me...

524
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,418
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

525
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:31,005
Learned judges, my case is simple.

526
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,716
It is based on our first article of faith.

527
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:37,177
That the almighty created the ape
in his own image.

528
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:39,722
That he gave him a soul and a mind.

529
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:42,182
That he set him apart
from the beasts of the jungle

530
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:45,269
and made him the lord of the planet.

531
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,896
These sacred truths are self-evident.

532
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:51,692
The proper study of apes is apes.

533
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,530
But certain young cynics
have chosen to study man.

534
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:03,579
Yes! Perverted scientists who advance
an insidious theory called evolution.

535
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,373
Come to the point, Dr. Honorious.

536
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:10,753
The state charges that Dr. Zira
and a corrupt surgeon named Galen

537
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,672
experimented on this wounded animal,

538
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:16,216
tampering with his brain
and throat tissues,

539
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,802
to produce a speaking monster.

540
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,304
That's a lie!

541
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:22,056
Mind your tongue, madam.

542
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,184
Did we create his mind as well?

543
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,311
Not only can this man speak,

544
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:30,064
he can think! He can reason.

545
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:34,401
That can reason?

546
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:40,074
With the tribunal's permission, allow me
to expose this hoax by direct examination.

547
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,577
Proceed, doctor. But do not
turn this hearing into a farce.

548
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:55,047
Tell the court, Bright Eyes,
what is the second article of faith?

549
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:59,426
I know nothing of your culture.
I admit that.

550
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:03,639
Of course he doesn't know our culture,
because he cannot think!

551
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,727
Tell us... Why are all apes created equal?

552
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,564
Some apes, it seems,
are more equal than others.

553
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,732
Ridiculous!

554
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,901
Tell us, Bright Eyes.

555
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,070
Why do men have no souls?

556
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:22,282
What is the proof that a divine spark
exists in the simian brain?

557
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:33,961
Read this for me.

558
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:48,016
Since the defendant has been forbidden
to speak in his own defense,

559
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:51,395
he requests that the following statement

560
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:53,564
be read into the record.

561
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:56,275
You read it, Dr. Cornelius. Read it.

562
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:04,658
"I have, uh, come to you from a planet
in a different solar system."

563
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:07,327
"I am an explorer in space..."

564
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:09,997
Stop right there. Let me see that paper.

565
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,505
It's a joke.

566
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,425
In very poor taste.

567
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:24,344
Is it a joke
to seek the truth about this man?

568
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:25,679
Dr. Zira,

569
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:28,432
you state here that a ship
from outer space

570
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:31,643
sank in an inland sea
of our eastern desert.

571
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:35,439
You state that Bright Eyes had
two intelligent companions with him

572
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:37,524
at the time of his capture.

573
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,526
That is his assertion.

574
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,695
Mr. President,

575
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:46,784
in addition to Bright Eyes,
I believe the prosecutor has reassembled

576
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:50,662
all the surviving humans
that were captured in the hunt.

577
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,623
That's true, Dr. Zaius.

578
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,750
Very well.

579
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:57,836
Then I suggest that we...
go take a look at 'em.

580
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,502
That's him! That's Landon!

581
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:41,088
- Which one?
- The tall one in the back.

582
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,760
Do you acknowledge kinship
with any of these creatures?

583
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:50,597
- With one of them, yes.
- Identify him, then. Speak to him.

584
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:54,768
Landon?

585
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:56,937
Landon.

586
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,611
Oh! They cut him!

587
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,324
Did you know about this?

588
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:13,078
No. I... I swear.
I never saw this man before.

589
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,247
But they...

590
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,041
You did it.

591
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,254
You cut up his brain, you bloody baboon!

592
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,423
Stop him!

593
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:37,185
Take him inside!

594
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:21,688
Mr. President, a word of explanation.

595
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,566
The human specimen you saw outside

596
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:28,153
suffered a skull fracture
in the course of the hunt.

597
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:33,450
Two fine veterinary surgeons under
my direction were able to save his life.

598
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,036
But the beast could not speak, of course.

599
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:38,246
Nor will he ever speak.

600
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,415
You did that to him, damn you!

601
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,252
Cut out his memory, took his identity,
and that's what you wanna do to me!

602
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,171
Bailiff! Gag the animal!

603
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,340
Damn you!

604
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:52,636
May it please the tribunal,

605
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,723
I grant you that this creature
cannot have come from another planet.

606
01:13:56,808 --> 01:14:01,061
But this much is certain. He does come
from somewhere in the forbidden zone.

607
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:04,189
He's described the region to us
and described it accurately for...

608
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,732
I have been there.

609
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,859
You visited the forbidden zone?

610
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,277
Yes, sir.

611
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,905
A year ago.
With the permission of the Academy.

612
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,115
He exceeded his orders.

613
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,326
His travel permit
was canceled immediately.

614
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:18,495
Yes, sir. That is true, thanks to you.

615
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:21,206
But not before I discovered evidence

616
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,961
of a simian culture that existed long
before the sacred scrolls were written.

617
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:29,840
Objection! These remarks
are profane and irrelevant!

618
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,884
Sustained. Your archaeological theories
have no bearing

619
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,679
on the disposition of this creature.

620
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:38,765
Let them talk, Mr. President.
Let them talk.

621
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:43,311
Sirs, our theories
have a bearing on his identity.

622
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,272
How so?

623
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:48,859
Let us assume, as common sense dictates,

624
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:51,987
that the prisoner's story is false.

625
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:55,490
But if he did not come
from another planet,

626
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:58,577
then surely he sprang from our own.

627
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:03,123
Yes! Sprang! As an animal psychologist,

628
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:08,712
I have found no physiological defect
to explain why humans are mute.

629
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:10,672
- Objection!
- Sustained!

630
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:12,591
Their speech organs are adequate.

631
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,927
The flaw lies not in anatomy,
but in the brain.

632
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,096
- Objection!
- Sustained!

633
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:21,808
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!

634
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:24,394
Yes! Behold this marvel!

635
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:26,563
This living paradox!

636
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,191
This missing link in an evolutionary chain!

637
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:30,901
Silence there!

638
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:32,152
You go too far.

639
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:34,696
I think an indictment is in order.

640
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:39,910
Yes, sir. The state charges Drs. Zira and
Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal,

641
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:42,412
malicious mischief, and scientific heresy.

642
01:15:42,497 --> 01:15:44,623
It is so ordered.

643
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:49,920
This tribunal will examine the evidence
and in due course render its verdict.

644
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,715
As to the proposed indictment
and as to the disposition

645
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,301
of the deviate in question,

646
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,011
this hearing is adjourned.

647
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,978
Wait outside.

648
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,866
Well, the verdict is in.

649
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:07,914
At the moment, your two simian friends
and sponsors are free on bail.

650
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,126
But they'll soon be brought to trial
for heresy.

651
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:13,295
What about me?

652
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:17,007
Your case was preordained.

653
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,926
In a way, you did the state a service

654
01:17:20,011 --> 01:17:24,931
because you made it possible for us
to expose Zira and Cornelius.

655
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:29,060
Now the tribunal
has placed you in my custody

656
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,271
for final disposition.

657
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:34,900
Do you realize what that means?

658
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,194
No.

659
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,821
Emasculation to begin with.

660
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:42,115
Then experimental surgery

661
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,743
on the speech centers - on the brain.

662
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:47,537
Eventually a kind of living death.

663
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:52,292
However,

664
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:56,463
I have it in my power to grant a reprieve.

665
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,841
That is why I summoned you here tonight.

666
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:05,555
Tell me who and what you really are
and where you came from,

667
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,891
and no veterinary shall touch you.

668
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:10,602
I told you that at that hearing of yours.

669
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,771
You lied!

670
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,898
Where is your tribe?

671
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:17,067
My tribe!

672
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:20,612
They live on another planet
in another solar system.

673
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:24,115
Even in your lies,
some truth slips through.

674
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,202
That mythical community
you're supposed to come from -

675
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,620
Fort Wayne.

676
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,789
- What about it?
- A fort!

677
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:35,085
Unconsciously you chose a name
that was belligerent.

678
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,212
Where were you nurtured?

679
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:41,967
Then... you don't believe
that prosecutor's charge

680
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,011
that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira?

681
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,180
Certainly not.

682
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:51,726
You're a mutant.

683
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:55,897
That's what Zira and Cornelius claim.
You're talking heresy, doctor.

684
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:58,024
Of course!

685
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:02,112
Suppose I am a mutant.
How can the appearance of one mutant

686
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:05,365
- send you into a panic?
- Because you're not unique.

687
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,952
- There's the one you call Landon.
- Oh. Then you admit that...

688
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:12,998
I admit that where there's one mutant,
there's probably another and another.

689
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,375
A whole nest of them.

690
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:18,211
Where is your nest, Taylor?

691
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,380
Where are your women?

692
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:22,590
Thank you.

693
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,801
Thank you for calling me Taylor.

694
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,970
Dr. Zaius,

695
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:29,139
I know who I am.

696
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:31,266
But who are you?

697
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:35,228
How in hell did this upside-down
civilization get started?

698
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:38,606
You may well call it upside down,

699
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:41,067
since you occupy its lowest level.

700
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,236
And deservedly so.

701
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:48,783
Our eastern desert
has never been explored

702
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:53,872
because we've always assumed
that life cannot exist there.

703
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:57,083
Taylor, save yourself!

704
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:02,088
Tell me, is there another jungle
beyond the forbidden zone?

705
01:20:02,173 --> 01:20:04,382
I don't know.

706
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:09,637
If you're trying to protect others
of your kind, it'll cost you your identity.

707
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,806
I'm not protecting anyone.

708
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:14,476
This whole thing is insane!
What have I done?

709
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:22,817
You are a menace.

710
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,195
A walking pestilence!

711
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:28,198
I do know who you are, Taylor.

712
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:33,995
I'll give you just six hours
to make a full confession.

713
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,956
After that
I shall use surgery to obtain one.

714
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,375
Guards!

715
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:41,753
All right. You can cut pieces out of me.
You've got the power.

716
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,130
Return this creature to his cage.

717
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,216
But you do it out of fear!

718
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,301
Remember that!
Because you're afraid of me!

719
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:51,262
What are you afraid of, doctor?

720
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,245
Are you Julius?

721
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:19,332
- Who are you?
- I'm from the office of animal affairs.

722
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:24,254
That male is to be transferred to the zoo.

723
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:26,089
At this hour?

724
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,924
Who says so?

725
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:30,260
Don't they tell you anything?

726
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:34,180
The antivivisectionist society
is up in arms.

727
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:38,268
They're gonna save this beast
from those butchers in the lab.

728
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:42,522
If he can speak, he belongs in a public zoo,
but what'll probably happen

729
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:47,068
is some money-mad grown-up'll put him
in a circus, and we'll have to pay...

730
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:49,946
Stop making speeches
and show me the order!

731
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:08,214
This order's no good.

732
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:12,093
It must be countersigned by Dr. Zaius.

733
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,137
Grab him!

734
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,102
Who are you?

735
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:23,229
So you can talk!

736
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:26,608
I'm Dr. Zira's nephew.
This abduction was her idea.

737
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:28,985
You're not really going to the zoo.

738
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,237
That's our story if somebody stops us.

739
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,406
Get me out of this.

740
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:37,869
We've gotta move fast!

741
01:22:40,915 --> 01:22:42,415
She comes along too.

742
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:45,418
- Zira doesn't want your female.
- I want her.

743
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:49,255
If you insist, but I'm not taking any orders.

744
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,424
All right. Come on! Let's go!

745
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:18,117
- I told you not to bring the other one!
- He wouldn't leave her.

746
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,286
Oh, all right. Come on!

747
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:31,464
- Here. Put this on.
- Don't you have any clothes for me?

748
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:34,008
What do you expect? An ape's new suit?

749
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:38,221
- This stuff stinks!
- Well, so do you. Like all men.

750
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:40,390
Taylor, remember,

751
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:42,600
all men look alike to most apes.

752
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,102
So put it on and keep quiet,

753
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:47,105
and we may just
get away with this. Hurry!

754
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:40,366
Cornelius!

755
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,084
How'd it go?

756
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:53,671
Come on!

757
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,882
Let me out of this!

758
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:07,393
Well, Taylor, we're all fugitives now.

759
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:10,313
Do you have any weapons? Any guns?

760
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:12,523
The best. But we won't need them.

761
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,068
I'm glad to hear it. I want one anyway.

762
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:26,412
Taylor, I'm in charge of this expedition!

763
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:27,497
Good for you.

764
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:30,333
But you're not in charge of me.
Not any more.

765
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,543
I don't plan to be caught again.

766
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:37,715
- As you wish.
- Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was

767
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,635
another jungle beyond the forbidden zone.

768
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:42,804
I'll try for that. What about you?

769
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:45,723
Cornelius and I have been
indicted for heresy.

770
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:49,811
Unless we can prove our theories,
we don't stand a chance of acquittal.

771
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:52,188
You're going back to the forbidden zone?

772
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:55,525
We're going back to the diggings
I worked at over a year ago.

773
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,819
It's a three-day ride across the desert.

774
01:25:57,945 --> 01:26:01,114
Near where you claim you landed
from that planet of yours.

775
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,992
- You still don't believe me, do you?
- It's a long detour to Dead Lake.

776
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,161
- What would we find?
- Nothing much.

777
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:12,750
An empty rubber life raft. Maybe a...
little flag, the emblem of my countrymen.

778
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:16,170
The terrain around that lake is poisonous.

779
01:26:16,255 --> 01:26:20,425
There's no fresh water,
no vegetation - nothing.

780
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:27,974
Anyway, I... ought to thank you
for saving me. You'll be in trouble for that.

781
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:32,812
We've been in trouble
since the moment we met you.

782
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:38,568
What's she pointing at?

783
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:41,654
This must be close to home for her.
She knows it.

784
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:48,119
Nova, no. Nova!

785
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:51,164
Nova, you can't go there!
It's not safe! Nova!

786
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,669
We'd better get started.

787
01:26:56,754 --> 01:26:59,839
If the mounted police pick up our trail,
they'll come this far.

788
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:03,676
Right. Let's get the water
and provisions into the wagon.

789
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:17,750
Cornelius!

790
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:23,005
Where does this river lead to?

791
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:28,177
It flows into a sea some miles from here.
That's where we'll find the diggings.

792
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:30,346
And beyond that?

793
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:34,308
I don't know. You can't ride
along the shore at high tide

794
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:37,270
and we had no boats
on our last expedition.

795
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:40,940
You never told me -
why do you call this the forbidden zone?

796
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:47,488
No one knows. It's an ancient taboo,
set forth in the sacred scrolls.

797
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:50,741
The lawgiver pronounced
this whole area deadly.

798
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:55,037
Shouldn't we be moving on?

799
01:28:55,706 --> 01:28:57,790
I'm for that.

800
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,631
Well? Do you like it?

801
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:36,222
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?

802
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:40,059
In my world, when I left it,
only kids your age wore beards.

803
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,436
Beards?

804
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:44,605
I don't go in for fads.

805
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:47,650
Somehow

806
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:50,236
it makes you look less intelligent.

807
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,823
When will you show me
what's in that cave?

808
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:56,033
Right now, if you like.

809
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:16,929
Cornelius!

810
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:31,152
- Lucius, don't fire at them!
- You're all under arrest!

811
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:38,868
If there's any more shooting,
Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to go.

812
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:40,703
You can count on it.

813
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:43,205
You are not in command.
Put down that gun.

814
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,457
Shut up!

815
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,500
Very well.

816
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:48,210
Lower your weapons.

817
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:51,964
Tell them to pull back around the rocks,
out of range.

818
01:31:52,758 --> 01:31:54,800
Withdraw!

819
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,724
How did you know we'd come here?

820
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:06,479
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate
would flee to the forbidden zone.

821
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:09,774
And only a fool
would give a gun to an animal.

822
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:13,819
I see you've brought
the female of your species.

823
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:17,698
I didn't realize
that man could be monogamous.

824
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:19,825
On this planet it's easy.

825
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:24,747
I'll ask you to reconsider
the rash course you've undertaken.

826
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:30,252
If you're convicted of heresy,
the most you'll get is two years, but

827
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:35,591
if you persist in pointing guns in
my direction, you'll hang for high treason.

828
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:38,302
We never meant to be treasonous, sir.

829
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:42,556
But up there, in the face of that cliff,
there is a vast cave,

830
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:46,685
and in that cave a fabulous treasure
of fossils and artifacts.

831
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:50,481
I've seen some of your fossils
and artifacts. They're worthless.

832
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,650
There's your minister of science.

833
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:55,861
Honor-bound to expand
the frontiers of knowledge.

834
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:58,114
- Taylor, please!
- Except he's also chief defender

835
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,698
of the faith.

836
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:03,994
There is no contradiction
between faith and science - true science.

837
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:07,540
- Are you willing to put it to the test?
- Taylor, I would rather...

838
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:11,794
Take it easy. You saved me from
this fanatic. Maybe I can return the favor.

839
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:14,004
What is your proposal?

840
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:17,967
When were those sacred scrolls
of yours written?

841
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:19,802
1,200 years ago.

842
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:24,974
All right. If they can prove those scrolls
don't tell the whole truth of your history,

843
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:27,351
if they can find some real evidence

844
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:31,188
of another culture from some remote past,
will you let them off?

845
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:34,233
- Of course.
- Let's go up to the cave.

846
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:42,908
Sorry, Lucius. You've got to stay here
and guard the camp.

847
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:46,120
Always giving orders.
Just like every other adult.

848
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:48,789
Relax. You'll get to see it all later on.

849
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:53,395
Present your evidence, Cornelius.

850
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:58,734
It was at this level that I discovered
traces of an early ape creature.

851
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:04,490
A stage of primitive barbarism really,
dating back some 1,300 years roughly.

852
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:10,162
It was at this level... I discovered
cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz

853
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:13,791
and the fossilized bones
of carnivorous gorillas.

854
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:17,086
But the artifacts

855
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,338
lying here

856
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:23,342
were found at this level,

857
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:26,512
and date back... 700 years earlier.

858
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:28,722
That's the paradox.

859
01:35:28,807 --> 01:35:32,393
For the more ancient culture
is the more advanced.

860
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:36,355
Now, admittedly,
many of these objects are unidentified.

861
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:40,693
But clearly they were fashioned
by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.

862
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:44,989
Indeed, the fact that many of these tools
are unknown to us

863
01:35:45,115 --> 01:35:49,660
suggests a culture which
in certain ways equals our own.

864
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:52,246
Some of the evidence is uncontestable.

865
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:56,166
Don't speak to me in absolutes.
The evidence is contestable!

866
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:59,128
I apologize, sir.

867
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:03,382
To begin with, your methods of dating
the past are crude to say the least.

868
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:07,386
There are geologists on my staff
who'd laugh at your speculations.

869
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:09,555
But there's the doll, sir.

870
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:11,765
What?

871
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:14,351
Oh, lying right there. The human doll.

872
01:36:21,026 --> 01:36:25,279
What does this prove?
My granddaughter plays with human dolls.

873
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:29,950
The doll was found
beside the jawbone of a man

874
01:36:30,035 --> 01:36:33,662
and no trace of simian fossil
has been found in this deposit.

875
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,873
Your conclusion is premature.

876
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:39,084
Have you forgotten your scripture?
The 13th scroll?

877
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:44,214
"And Proteus brought the upright beast
into the garden and chained him to a tree,

878
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:48,594
- and the children did make sport of him."
- No, sir, I have not forgotten.

879
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:53,182
Well, for a time the ancients
kept humans as household pets

880
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:57,269
until our lawgiver proved
that man could not be tamed.

881
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:59,563
Keep digging, Cornelius.

882
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:03,275
You'll find evidence
of the master of this house...

883
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,987
An ape.

884
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:11,033
What are you doing?

885
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:14,119
Reconstructing a past life.

886
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:19,124
You say these things were found
at the same level as that doll?

887
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:22,836
Whoever owned them
must have been in pretty bad shape.

888
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:25,005
He wore false teeth.

889
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:28,092
And eyeglasses.

890
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:31,303
He had a failing heart.

891
01:37:32,055 --> 01:37:36,850
Towards the end, he... had
this prefabricated valve put in it.

892
01:37:38,937 --> 01:37:41,313
I don't say he was a man
like I knew at home,

893
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:45,317
but he must have been a close relative.
He had all the same weaknesses.

894
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,529
He was a weak,

895
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:50,697
fragile animal.

896
01:37:50,824 --> 01:37:52,908
But he was here before you

897
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,077
and he was better than you are.

898
01:37:55,161 --> 01:38:00,999
That's lunacy! I can offer alternate
descriptions of every one of those articles

899
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:04,044
which is just as ingenious as yours.

900
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:07,005
But it'd be conjecture, not proof.

901
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:18,058
Mamma!

902
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:24,523
Dr. Zaius, would an ape make a human doll

903
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,150
that talks?

904
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:31,989
Lucius!

905
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:36,660
You dirty...

906
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:59,641
Nova!

907
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:39,181
Cornelius!

908
01:39:39,265 --> 01:39:41,141
Zira!

909
01:39:41,226 --> 01:39:43,268
Help me!

910
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,439
Mamma!

911
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,114
I oughta kill you right now.

912
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:57,616
Come on!

913
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:01,119
Tell 'em to pull back. Now!

914
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:03,664
Cease fire! Withdraw!

915
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,209
Up there!

916
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:09,378
Withdraw!

917
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:13,632
Get down!

918
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:29,147
Lucius, are you all right?

919
01:40:29,232 --> 01:40:31,483
They took me by surprise.

920
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:35,153
Sneaked up on me
while I was feeding the horses.

921
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:37,322
What's happened to honor?

922
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:40,742
I got off two rounds to warn you.

923
01:40:40,827 --> 01:40:44,580
- They've taken everything.
- Not quite everything!

924
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:47,666
They left a hostage behind.

925
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:50,502
- How are you feeling?
- Disillusioned.

926
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:53,130
You can't trust the older generation.

927
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:55,465
I know what you mean.

928
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:59,803
I want you to go round the rocks and tell
those gorillas I've got Dr. Zaius prisoner.

929
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:02,055
Yes, I can do that.

930
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:06,435
I want a horse, food, and water.
Enough for a week for me and this female.

931
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:10,606
- And 50 rounds of ammunition.
- What if they won't agree to your terms?

932
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:12,733
Tell them I'll shoot him.

933
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:14,901
Taylor, you can't!

934
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,112
Oh, yes, he can.

935
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:19,906
He's a born killer.

936
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:22,117
Deliver the message.

937
01:41:23,745 --> 01:41:25,871
Over here.

938
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:31,543
Sit down.

939
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:51,647
Taylor, please! Don't treat him like that!

940
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:54,399
- Why not?
- It's humiliating.

941
01:41:55,735 --> 01:41:59,279
The way I was humiliated... by all of you?

942
01:41:59,364 --> 01:42:01,406
You led me around on a leash!

943
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:04,534
That was different.
We thought you were inferior.

944
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:06,787
Now you know better.

945
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:09,665
Cornelius was right, doctor. He proved it.

946
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:13,502
Man was here first. You owe him
your science, your culture,

947
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:17,547
- whatever civilization you've got.
- Then answer me this.

948
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:21,301
If man was superior,
why didn't he survive?

949
01:42:21,386 --> 01:42:25,847
Wiped out by a plague, some natural
catastrophe, a storm of meteors.

950
01:42:25,932 --> 01:42:29,267
From the looks of some parts
of this planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.

951
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:30,977
But we can't be sure.

952
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:32,813
He is.

953
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:37,275
He knew all the time.
Long before you found your cave, he knew.

954
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,987
Defender of the faith?
Guardian of the terrible secret.

955
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:43,407
- That's it, isn't it, doctor?
- What I know of man

956
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:45,575
was written long ago.

957
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:49,246
Set down by the greatest ape of all,
our lawgiver.

958
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:50,455
Cornelius,

959
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:52,624
come here.

960
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:55,752
Reach into my pocket. Read to him

961
01:42:55,837 --> 01:42:57,921
the 29th scroll.

962
01:42:58,005 --> 01:42:59,423
6th verse.

963
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:07,347
"Beware the beast man,
for he is the devil's pawn."

964
01:43:07,432 --> 01:43:10,016
"Alone among God's primates,

965
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:14,354
he kills for sport or lust or greed."

966
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:19,484
"Yea, he will murder his brother
to possess his brother's land."

967
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:22,487
"Let him not breed in great numbers,

968
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:26,908
for he will make a desert
of his home and yours."

969
01:43:26,993 --> 01:43:29,077
"Shun him."

970
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:31,747
"Drive him back into his jungle lair."

971
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:35,125
"For he is the harbinger of death."

972
01:43:37,086 --> 01:43:40,589
I found nothing in the cave
to alter that conception of man

973
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:42,674
and I still live by its injunction.

974
01:43:51,517 --> 01:43:53,602
That's far enough!

975
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:03,278
They think you're behaving foolishly.

976
01:44:03,946 --> 01:44:06,031
I must say, I agree!

977
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:08,241
Where will you go?

978
01:44:08,326 --> 01:44:11,703
To start with, I'll follow
the shoreline and my nose.

979
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:15,081
But suppose you find nothing
but... but wasteland?

980
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:17,292
How will you survive?

981
01:44:17,376 --> 01:44:18,960
He won't survive.

982
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:26,051
Nova.

983
01:44:28,888 --> 01:44:30,931
How about coming along?

984
01:44:31,057 --> 01:44:34,267
- We can't.
- It's better than going to jail for heresy.

985
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:36,561
Oh, they can't convict us of heresy.

986
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:38,980
You've helped prove our innocence.

987
01:44:39,065 --> 01:44:41,566
Besides... his culture

988
01:44:41,651 --> 01:44:43,944
is our culture.

989
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:46,780
Well, good luck, then.

990
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:55,205
Lucius.

991
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:57,666
I still say you're making a mistake.

992
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:00,043
That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying.

993
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:02,921
- What?
- The flags of discontent.

994
01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:05,924
Remember, never trust anybody over 30.

995
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:09,135
Doctor, I'd like to kiss you goodbye.

996
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:18,812
All right, but

997
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:20,981
you're so damned ugly.

998
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:50,051
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.

999
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:52,220
Of that I'm sure.

1000
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:57,642
All my life I've awaited your coming
and dreaded it, like death itself.

1001
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:58,768
Why?

1002
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:02,939
I've terrified you from the first, doctor.
I still do.

1003
01:46:03,024 --> 01:46:05,817
You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?

1004
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,153
Because you're a man.

1005
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:10,322
And you're right.

1006
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:12,949
I have always known about man.

1007
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:20,040
From the evidence, I believe his wisdom
must walk hand in hand with his idiocy.

1008
01:46:20,166 --> 01:46:22,542
His emotions must rule his brain.

1009
01:46:22,627 --> 01:46:25,754
He must be a warlike creature
who gives battle

1010
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:28,673
to everything around him, even himself.

1011
01:46:28,758 --> 01:46:32,052
What evidence?
There were no weapons in that cave.

1012
01:46:32,178 --> 01:46:35,430
The forbidden zone was once a paradise.

1013
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:39,809
Your breed made a desert of it... ages ago.

1014
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:42,103
It still doesn't give me the why.

1015
01:46:42,188 --> 01:46:44,856
A planet where apes evolved from men.

1016
01:46:46,359 --> 01:46:48,485
There's gotta be an answer.

1017
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:50,654
Don't look for it, Taylor.

1018
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:53,865
You may not like what you find.

1019
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:04,292
Untie me!

1020
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:20,100
No, no, no! Wait!

1021
01:47:20,226 --> 01:47:22,268
Wait!

1022
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:24,479
Let him go!

1023
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:30,276
Lieutenant, fetch your explosives.
We're going to seal up the cave.

1024
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:31,653
Yes, sir!

1025
01:47:31,737 --> 01:47:33,905
- Seal the cave?
- That is correct.

1026
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:36,658
And you will both stand trial for heresy.

1027
01:47:36,742 --> 01:47:40,829
- But the proof! The doll!
- In a few minutes there will be no doll.

1028
01:47:40,913 --> 01:47:42,998
There can't be. I'm sorry.

1029
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:44,541
Dr. Zaius!

1030
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:47,002
Dr. Zaius, you mustn't! You promised!

1031
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:49,170
What I do, I do with no pleasure.

1032
01:47:49,255 --> 01:47:51,506
- Silence him!
- Doctor.

1033
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:54,509
Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable!

1034
01:47:55,136 --> 01:47:57,637
Why must knowledge stand still?

1035
01:47:57,722 --> 01:47:59,764
What about the future?

1036
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:03,101
I may just have saved it for you.

1037
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,606
What will he find out there, doctor?

1038
01:48:09,942 --> 01:48:12,277
His destiny.

1039
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:24,742
Oh, my God!

1040
01:50:25,578 --> 01:50:27,704
I'm back!

1041
01:50:28,873 --> 01:50:31,207
I'm home.

1042
01:50:31,292 --> 01:50:33,585
All the time, it was...

1043
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:37,797
We finally really did it.

1044
01:50:38,924 --> 01:50:41,009
You maniacs!

1045
01:50:42,428 --> 01:50:44,721
You blew it up!

1046
01:50:44,805 --> 01:50:46,890
God damn you!

1047
01:50:47,892 --> 01:50:52,729
God damn you all to hell!
