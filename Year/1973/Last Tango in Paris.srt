1
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,660
Fucking God!

2
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,314
''Apartment For Rent''

3
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:14,485
l`d like a phone slug.

4
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,121
- All out. Down, back and left.
- Thanks.

5
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,850
Momma, this is Jeanne.

6
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,250
There`s an apartment in Passy
l`m going to see.

7
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:19,682
Then l go meet Tom at the station.

8
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,693
See you later.

9
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,127
Kisses. So long.

10
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:28,265
l`m here for the apartment.

11
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,562
l saw the sign.

12
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:30,864
- Sign?
- Yes.

13
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:32,529
What sign?

14
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:36,132
Always the same.
Nobody tells me anything.

15
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,905
- l`d like to see it.
- To rent it?

16
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,240
l don`t know yet.

17
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:44,647
They rent, they leave,
and l`m the last to know.

18
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:47,744
You think that`s fair?

19
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:52,216
lf you want to go up alone,
go on.

20
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,226
l`m afraid of the rats.

21
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:58,253
The key is gone.

22
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:00,356
Lots of strange things happen.

23
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,638
They drink six bottles a day.

24
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:14,004
Wait. There must be a duplicate.

25
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:23,888
Here it is.

26
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,482
You`re very young, right?

27
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,253
Let me go, please.

28
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,538
She`s crazy.

29
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:35,527
Where are you?

30
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,699
What a fright.
How`d you get in?

31
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,898
By the door.

32
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:47,337
Oh, yes. l left it open.

33
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,341
But l didn`t hear you come in.

34
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,079
- l was already here.
- Excuse me?

35
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:58,239
Then the key--

36
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:00,252
And l bribed the concierge.

37
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:07,792
These old houses are fascinating.

38
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,867
An armchair would look good here.

39
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,174
The armchair has to go...

40
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:24,799
in front of the window.

41
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:26,812
You are American?

42
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,616
You have an American accent.

43
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,738
- Will you rent it?
- And you?

44
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:34,045
l don`t know.

45
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,748
What are you doing?

46
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,893
Do l answer or not?

47
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:06,867
There`s no one here.

48
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:10,136
There is no one.

49
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,143
l don`t know.

50
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:59,490
Then you decided to take it?

51
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,264
l had decided, but--

52
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:10,161
But now l don`t know.

53
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:14,839
Do you like it?

54
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,369
Do you?

55
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:19,377
l have to think about it.

56
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,021
Think fast.

57
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,169
You still here?

58
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:18,308
Attention.

59
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:20,572
Who do they take us for?

60
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:23,376
This is cinema.
We`re making a movie.

61
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:27,215
lf l kiss you,
that might be cinema.

62
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:30,687
lf l caress you,
it might be cinema.

63
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:33,884
What the devil do they want?
l know them.

64
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:38,589
l`m shooting a film-- ''Portrait
of a Girl--'' for television.

65
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:40,632
And the girl is you.

66
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:43,668
But you`re mad! You should have
asked my permission.

67
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:45,670
Yes, but it amuses me...

68
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:50,175
to begin with the girl
of the portrait who meets her fiance.

69
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,073
This is my crew.

70
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:54,578
And so you kiss me...

71
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:58,708
knowing it`s a film.

72
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:00,251
Coward!

73
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,117
See, it`ll be most of all
a love story.

74
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:06,781
Tell me,Jeanne.

75
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:09,089
What did you do
while l was away?

76
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:12,221
l thought of you day and night
and l cried.

77
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,562
Darling, l can`t
live without you.

78
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:16,601
Magnificent! Stop! Perfect!

79
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,976
l wanted to clean up...

80
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:31,983
but the police didn`t let me.

81
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:34,451
They didn`t believe in suicide.

82
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,078
Too much blood all over.

83
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:41,151
They had fun making me reenact.

84
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,201
''She went there.

85
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:56,240
She went here.

86
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:02,246
She opened the curtain.``

87
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:04,976
l did everything like her.

88
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,951
The clients, awake all night.

89
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,114
The hotel full of police.

90
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,124
They playing around with the blood.

91
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,103
All spies.

92
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:31,301
lf she was sad,
if she was happy...

93
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,572
lf you fought,
if you hit each other.

94
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,773
And then when you were married...

95
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:37,782
why you didn`t have children.

96
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:41,352
Pigs.

97
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,588
They treated me like dirt.

98
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,627
They said...

99
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:50,628
''Nervous type, your boss.

100
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,493
You know he was a boxer?``

101
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:59,466
So?

102
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,472
''But he didn`t do well.''

103
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:04,608
Then he was...

104
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:07,738
an actor.

105
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:09,747
And then a bongo player.

106
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:18,919
Revolutionary in South America.

107
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:21,619
Journalist in Japan.

108
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:24,822
One day he debarks in Tahiti.

109
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,831
Wanders around.

110
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,698
Learns French.

111
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,930
Then he arrives in Paris.

112
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,370
And here...

113
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:41,311
meets a woman with money.

114
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,711
Marries her and--

115
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,484
''Now what`s your boss do?''

116
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,412
He`s kept.

117
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,782
''Can l clean up now?''

118
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:55,793
''Don`t touch anything.

119
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:58,227
You really think...

120
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:01,564
she killed herself?``

121
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,935
And then he pushed me
in a corner trying to--

122
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:10,538
Turn off the water.

123
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:13,305
Maybe they`ll do an autopsy.

124
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:19,783
Why don`t you
turn off the water?

125
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:21,786
Here`s your razor.

126
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:28,155
lt`s not mine.

127
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:30,388
They don`t need it anymore.

128
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:32,396
The inquiry is over.

129
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,530
Yes, she had some cuts here
and on the neck.

130
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,841
Excuse me.
Where should l put it?

131
00:23:56,915 --> 00:24:00,043
- You could have rung.
- lt was open. Here?

132
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:04,321
No, in front of the fireplace.

133
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:08,759
And these chairs?

134
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:15,295
Here`s the table.
Where do l put it?

135
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,857
How do l know?
He`ll decide.

136
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:18,926
l`ll leave it here.

137
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:24,675
- Heavy. lt`s really a double.
- But it won`t fit.

138
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:27,974
You`ll see.
Your husband`ll find room.

139
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:37,788
What a mess.

140
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,082
Thank you.

141
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:52,364
This armchair has to go
in front of the window.

142
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:53,631
Like that.

143
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:56,970
l only came to return the key.

144
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:59,442
- To return it to you.
- What do l care?

145
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:01,445
Take off your coat.

146
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:05,082
Come on. Give me a hand.

147
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:11,251
Take these chairs...

148
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:13,257
and put them here.

149
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:19,722
Put them on the other side.

150
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:21,732
Take it too.

151
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,767
You didn`t lose any time.

152
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:36,837
Listen, sir...

153
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,042
l have to go.

154
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:41,585
Look, sir, l`ve gotta go.

155
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:46,988
The bed is too big
for the room.

156
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,050
l don`t know what to call you.

157
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:51,425
l don`t have a name.

158
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:53,293
- You want to know my name?
- No, l don`t!

159
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:55,856
l don`t wanna know your name.

160
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,799
You don`t have a name
and l don`t have a name either.

161
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,964
No names here.
Not one name.

162
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,666
You`re crazy.

163
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:06,074
Maybe l am, but l don`t wanna know
anything about you.

164
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:08,612
l don`t wanna know where you live
or where you come from.

165
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,376
l wanna know nothing!
You understand?

166
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,384
- You scare me.
- Nothing.

167
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:17,722
You and l are gonna meet here...

168
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:20,553
without knowing anything
that goes on outside here.

169
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:26,630
But why?

170
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:30,024
Because...

171
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:32,900
we don`t need names here.

172
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:36,907
Don`t you see?

173
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:41,404
We`re gonna forget...

174
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,175
everything that we knew.

175
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:45,682
Every-- All the people...

176
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:47,582
all that we do, all that we--

177
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:50,315
Wherever we live.

178
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:52,880
We`re going to forget that.
Everything.

179
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:59,263
But l can`t.

180
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,365
Can you?

181
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:05,369
l don`t know.

182
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,773
Are you scared?

183
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:22,186
Come.

184
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:59,720
- l thought l`d find you here.
- l expected you later.

185
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:07,531
l took the first train.

186
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:12,535
Paul, how horrible!

187
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:38,062
Papa is in bed with asthma.

188
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,363
The doctors forbade him
to come.

189
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,002
Better.

190
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:50,438
l`m stronger.

191
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,126
What are you looking for?

192
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,224
Something that explains it.

193
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,360
A letter, a clue--

194
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:23,874
There`s nothing,
absolutely nothing.

195
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,608
lt`s impossible
that my little Rose--

196
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:36,813
Nothing for her mother.
Not a word.

197
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:38,947
Useless to look anymore.

198
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:44,293
Not even for you,
her husband.

199
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:54,805
You need to rest.

200
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:59,110
Maybe there`s a vacant room.

201
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,107
With a razor?

202
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:38,048
What time did it happen?

203
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:43,018
l don`t know. At night.

204
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:47,822
And then?

205
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:49,451
And then--

206
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:53,055
l already told you on the phone.

207
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,065
When l found her...

208
00:30:57,435 --> 00:31:00,233
l called the ambulance.

209
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:04,840
After your telephone call...

210
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,311
we were awake
all night long...

211
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,178
talking about you and Rose.

212
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:13,183
And Papa talked softly...

213
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:17,521
as if it happened
in our house.

214
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:36,139
- Where did it happen?
- ln a room.

215
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,836
Did she suffer?

216
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,105
Ask the doctors
who did the autopsy.

217
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:43,806
The autopsy?

218
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:17,438
l already had some announcements.

219
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:20,245
l`ve had enough of deaths.

220
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:22,513
l think of everything.
l do.

221
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:26,250
l`ll prepare
a lovely funeral chamber...

222
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:27,985
with lots of flowers.

223
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:34,028
The cards...

224
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,158
the mourning clothes,
the flowers.

225
00:32:37,969 --> 00:32:40,096
You have everything
in that suitcase.

226
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,407
You didn`t forget anything.

227
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:47,607
But l don`t want
any priests here.

228
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:51,909
Understand?

229
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,918
You need them.
lt must be a religious funeral.

230
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:58,149
Rose wasn`t a believer.

231
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:00,748
Nobody believes
in a fucking God here!

232
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,158
Paul, don`t shout.
Don`t shout like that!

233
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:12,129
A priest doesn`t want
any suicides.

234
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,433
Church doesn`t want
any suicides, do they?

235
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:18,336
They`ll give her absolution.

236
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,574
Absolution and a nice mass.
That`s all l ask.

237
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:26,708
Understand? Rose--
She`s my baby girl.

238
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:31,153
Why did she kill herself?

239
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:32,917
Why?

240
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:35,516
Why did she kill herself?

241
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:38,985
Why?

242
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:51,668
You don`t know, do you?

243
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:54,678
You don`t know.

244
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:45,856
Let`s just look at each other.

245
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:58,459
lt`s beautiful
without knowing anything.

246
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:16,850
Maybe--

247
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:19,253
Maybe we can come
without touching.

248
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:23,693
Come without touching?

249
00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:34,297
You concentrating?

250
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:36,704
Did you come yet?

251
00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:38,935
- lt`s difficult.
- l didn`t either yet.

252
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,979
You`re not trying hard enough.

253
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:53,122
l shall have to invent
a name for you.

254
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:55,421
A name? Oh,Jesus.

255
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:58,053
Christ.

256
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:02,327
Oh, God, l`ve been called
by a million names all my life.

257
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,860
l don`t want a name. l`m better off
with a grunt or a groan for a name.

258
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,974
You want to hear my name?

259
00:37:16,814 --> 00:37:19,715
So masculine.
Listen to mine.

260
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:28,291
l didn`t get the last name.

261
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:18,840
You shouldn`t have
done that to me.

262
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:22,838
But it`s not a wig.
lt`s mine.

263
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:32,079
l`m not beautiful?

264
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,885
Tell me you don`t
like the way l look.

265
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,153
But l do
like the way you look.

266
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:39,355
Listen.

267
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,230
You seem changed,
but you`re the same.

268
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:47,302
l can already see a shot.

269
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:49,897
The camera is high.

270
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:52,704
lt slowly descends
toward you.

271
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:55,871
And as you advance,
it moves in on you.

272
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:57,881
There`s music too.

273
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:04,152
lt gets closer
and closer to you.

274
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:06,349
l`m in a hurry.
Let`s begin.

275
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:11,391
But first we`ll
talk about it a little.

276
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:15,532
Tonight we improvise.

277
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,534
Follow me.

278
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:32,307
He was my childhood friend.

279
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:36,319
He would watch me for hours.
Maybe he understood me.

280
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:39,550
Dogs are better than people.

281
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:43,819
May l present Olympia,
my nurse.

282
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:46,955
Mustapha knew how to tell
the poor from the rich.

283
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:51,229
lf someone well-dressed
came in, he didn`t growl.

284
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:55,636
But if it was a beggar,
you should have seen him.

285
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:58,676
The colonel had him recognize Arabs
by their odor.

286
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:01,507
- Olympia, open the door.
- First, give me a kiss.

287
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:06,409
Go and open it.

288
00:40:06,484 --> 00:40:09,146
Olympia is the personification
of domestic virtue.

289
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,654
Faithful, economic and racist.

290
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:17,589
At Papa`s death, we moved
to the old country house.

291
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:21,522
My childhood was
made up of smells.

292
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,227
The mold on the walls,
the closed rooms.

293
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,896
Many children came to play.

294
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:29,838
We ran from morning to night.

295
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:32,102
Growing old is a crime.

296
00:40:32,176 --> 00:40:35,009
That`s me.

297
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:38,344
And that`s Mademoiselle Sauvage,
the teacher.

298
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,441
Severe and religious.

299
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:42,509
She was too good
and spoiled you.

300
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:48,522
This is Christine.
The best friend.

301
00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:51,118
She`s married
and has two children.

302
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:53,629
lt`s like a village here.
Everyone knows everyone.

303
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:56,496
l couldn`t live in Paris.

304
00:40:58,236 --> 00:40:59,430
lt`s more humane here.

305
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:01,404
lt`s melancholy
remembering the past.

306
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:04,066
Why melancholy?

307
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:06,372
lt`s marvelous.

308
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:08,844
lt`s your childhood.
lt`s everything l want.

309
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:11,575
And what are you doing there?

310
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:14,641
Who are all these zombies
around us?

311
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:18,179
The door!

312
00:41:18,256 --> 00:41:21,089
l`m opening the door.

313
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:23,093
l`m opening the doors!

314
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:26,187
- What are you doing?
- Setting up the shot.

315
00:41:27,298 --> 00:41:30,096
There. l found it.

316
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:32,033
Reverse gear.

317
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:35,072
And what are you doing here?

318
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:37,664
Beat it! Scram!

319
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:40,472
Yes. Reverse gear!

320
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:43,207
Understand? Like a car.

321
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:47,012
Put it in reverse.

322
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:48,483
Close your eyes.

323
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:51,681
Back up. Close your eyes.

324
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:55,692
Come forward, backing up.

325
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,490
Keep going
and find your childhood again.

326
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:00,963
lt`s Papa.

327
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:03,933
There. You take off
and find your childhood again.

328
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:05,400
ln full dress uniform.

329
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:08,097
Don`t be afraid.
Overcome the obstacles.

330
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:11,604
Papa in Algiers.

331
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:14,975
You are fifteen. Fourteen.

332
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:17,674
Thirteen. Twelve.

333
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:20,444
Eleven. Ten. Nine.

334
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:24,521
My favorite street
at eight years old.

335
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:33,429
My notebook.

336
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,661
My French homework.
Theme: ''The Countryside.''

337
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:43,298
Exposition: ''The country
is the home of the cows.

338
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:45,638
The cow is
all dressed in leather.

339
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,168
The cow has four sides:
front, back...

340
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:53,340
top and bottom.``

341
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,214
- lsn`t that good?
- Really charming.

342
00:42:56,287 --> 00:43:01,520
Source of my culture
was Larousse and l copied it.

343
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:04,755
''Menstruation. Feminine noun.

344
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:09,163
Physiological function
consisting in flow.

345
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,292
Penis. Masculine noun.

346
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:15,999
Organ of copulation, measuring
between five and 40 centimeters.``

347
00:43:16,073 --> 00:43:17,540
This is a little Robert!

348
00:43:21,746 --> 00:43:23,145
Look.

349
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:26,149
- Who is it?
- My first love.

350
00:43:26,217 --> 00:43:29,584
- Who?
- lt`s my cousin Paul. The first love.

351
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:32,088
- But his eyes are closed.
- What?

352
00:43:32,156 --> 00:43:33,680
His eyes are closed!

353
00:43:33,758 --> 00:43:35,692
He played piano very well.

354
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,526
That`s how l remember him--
sitting at the piano.

355
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:42,498
His fingers flew over the keys.

356
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:44,693
He practiced hour after hour.

357
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:49,907
At the bottom of the garden
there were two trees.

358
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:53,410
A plantain and a chestnut.

359
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:55,274
Sunday after mass...

360
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:58,247
everyone sat under his own tree.

361
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:00,784
lt was marvelous.

362
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,876
We looked into each other`s eyes.

363
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:05,821
And for me these trees
were the jungle.

364
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:10,992
- What are you doing?
- We`re shitting.

365
00:44:11,062 --> 00:44:12,654
Why? Can`t you see ?

366
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,925
- ln my jungle?
- Let`s run!

367
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:24,240
Shoot! Shoot!

368
00:44:25,743 --> 00:44:27,734
Did you get everything?

369
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:37,387
- Did you get it?
- Everything.

370
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:41,915
Olympia was sublime. She gave
a precise idea of her racism.

371
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:44,291
This really is a jungle.

372
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:46,296
Tell me about your father.

373
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:48,730
- Aren`t we finished?
- Five minutes.

374
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:51,233
But l`m in a hurry
for work.

375
00:44:51,302 --> 00:44:53,429
But the colonel?

376
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:58,472
The colonel had green eyes
and shiny boots.

377
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:01,010
l loved him like a god.

378
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:03,012
He was so handsome
in his uniform.

379
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,481
What a steaming pile
of horseshit.

380
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:09,041
What are you saying?
l forbid you.

381
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,624
All uniforms are bullshit.

382
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:16,853
Everything outside this place
is bullshit.

383
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,461
Besides that, l don`t want to hear
about your stories about your past.

384
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:27,866
He died in `58 in Algeria.

385
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:30,702
Or `68 or `2 8 or `98.

386
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:34,040
ln `58,
and l forbid you to joke.

387
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:37,638
Why don`t you stop talking about things
that don`t matter here?

388
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:40,843
What the hell`s the difference?

389
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:48,154
So what do l have to say
and what do l have to do?

390
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:53,455
Come on the good ship lollipop.

391
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:14,717
Why don`t you go back to America?

392
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:26,763
l don`t know.

393
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:30,366
Bad memories, l guess.

394
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:36,139
Of what?

395
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:45,280
My father was a drunk.

396
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:51,380
Tough, whore-fucker,
bar fighter...

397
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:53,389
super masculine...

398
00:46:55,092 --> 00:46:58,357
and he was tough.

399
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:00,363
My mother was very--

400
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:04,265
very poetic.

401
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:06,303
And also a drunk.

402
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:15,268
All my memories
when l was a kid...

403
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:17,610
was of her being arrested nude.

404
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:20,241
We lived in this small town.

405
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:22,808
Farming community.
We lived on a farm.

406
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:27,223
And l`d come home after school...

407
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:33,429
and she`d be gone...

408
00:47:33,497 --> 00:47:35,829
or in jail or something.

409
00:47:38,169 --> 00:47:40,103
And then--

410
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:48,868
l used to have to milk a cow.

411
00:47:50,214 --> 00:47:52,682
Every morning and every night.
l liked that.

412
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:57,487
But l remember...

413
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:02,184
one time l was all dressed up...

414
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:05,285
to go out and take this girl
to a basketball game.

415
00:48:06,864 --> 00:48:11,164
l started to go and my father said,
''You have to milk the cow.''

416
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:15,865
l asked him,
''Would you please milk it for me?''

417
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,340
He said, ''No,
get your ass out there.''

418
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:22,274
So l went out
and l was in a hurry.

419
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:26,248
Didn`t have time
to change my shoes, and l had...

420
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:28,615
cow shit all over my shoes.

421
00:48:28,686 --> 00:48:33,020
On the way to the basketball game,
it smelled in the car.

422
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:36,425
And...

423
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:44,132
l don`t know, l just--

424
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:47,637
l can`t remember
very many good things.

425
00:48:50,074 --> 00:48:52,099
Not one?

426
00:48:52,176 --> 00:48:54,110
Yeah. Some.

427
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:58,541
There was a farmer.
Very nice guy.

428
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:00,743
Old guy, very poor
and worked real hard.

429
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:02,752
l used to...

430
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,187
work in a ditch
draining land for farming.

431
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:11,124
And he wore overalls
and he smoked a clay pipe.

432
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:16,933
Half the time he wouldn`t
put tobacco in it.

433
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:19,162
And l hated the work.

434
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:21,170
lt was hot and dirty and...

435
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,774
broke my back.

436
00:49:26,777 --> 00:49:29,644
All day long l`d watch his spit...

437
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:34,013
which would run down the pipe stem
and hang on the bowl of the pipe.

438
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:39,849
l used to make bets with myself
on when it was gonna fall off.

439
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:42,221
And l always lost.

440
00:49:42,293 --> 00:49:44,158
l never saw it fall off.

441
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:49,324
l`d just look around and it`d be gone
and a new one would be there.

442
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,334
Then we had a beautiful--

443
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:57,234
Well, my mother
taught me to love nature.

444
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:01,273
And...

445
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:03,472
l guess that was
the most she could do.

446
00:50:06,216 --> 00:50:08,980
And in front of our house...

447
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:12,420
we had this big field, meadow.

448
00:50:13,657 --> 00:50:15,955
lt was a mustard field
in the summer.

449
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:20,122
We had a big,
black dog named Dutchy.

450
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:23,291
She used to hunt for rabbits
in that field.

451
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:26,097
But she couldn`t see them.

452
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,196
So she`d have to leap up
in this mustard field...

453
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:33,710
look around very quickly
to see where the rabbits were.

454
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:36,507
And it was...

455
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,208
very beautiful.

456
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:41,183
She never caught the rabbits.

457
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:43,947
You have been had.

458
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:45,352
Oh, really?

459
00:50:45,422 --> 00:50:51,088
l don`t wanna know anything
about your past, baby.

460
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:53,288
Think l was
telling you the truth?

461
00:50:57,134 --> 00:50:59,068
Maybe.

462
00:51:10,013 --> 00:51:13,380
l`m Red Riding Hood
and you`re the wolf.

463
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:24,655
Oh, what strong arms you have.

464
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:27,663
The better to squeeze
a fart out of you.

465
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:31,867
What long nails you have.

466
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,538
The better to scratch your ass with.

467
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,376
What a lot of fur you have.

468
00:51:45,282 --> 00:51:48,581
The better
to let your crabs hide in.

469
00:51:55,626 --> 00:51:59,187
What a long tongue you have.

470
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:04,064
The better to stick in your rear,
my dear.

471
00:52:16,947 --> 00:52:18,881
What`s this for?

472
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:26,379
That`s your happiness
and my ''ha-penis.''

473
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:28,322
Peanuts?

474
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:29,916
Schlong.

475
00:52:36,967 --> 00:52:38,901
Prick.Joint.

476
00:52:43,073 --> 00:52:44,802
lt`s funny.

477
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,366
lt`s like playing grown-ups
when you`re little.

478
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:51,246
l feel like a child again here.

479
00:52:52,382 --> 00:52:56,443
- Did you have fun as a kid?
- lt`s the most beautiful thing.

480
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,014
ls it beautiful to be made
into a tattletale...

481
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:05,152
or forced to admire authority or
sell yourself for a piece of candy?

482
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:08,221
- l wasn`t like that.
- No?

483
00:53:08,298 --> 00:53:10,823
l was writing poems.

484
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:14,894
l was drawing castles,
big castles with tower.

485
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:16,906
A lot of tower.

486
00:53:19,343 --> 00:53:22,574
- You never thought about sex?
- No, no sex.

487
00:53:22,646 --> 00:53:25,080
- No, no sex.
- Tower.

488
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:29,282
You were probably in love
with your teacher then.

489
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:33,255
- My teacher was a woman.
- Then she was a lesbian.

490
00:53:33,323 --> 00:53:36,156
- How did you know?
- That`s classical.

491
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:38,851
But anyway--

492
00:53:38,929 --> 00:53:41,420
My first love
was my cousin Paul.

493
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:47,269
l`m gonna get a hemorrhoid
if you keep telling me names.

494
00:53:47,337 --> 00:53:48,964
No names.

495
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:51,940
l don`t mind if you tell the truth,
but don`t give me the names.

496
00:53:52,009 --> 00:53:53,943
- l can`t handle that.
- Sorry.

497
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:02,209
Go on and tell the truth.

498
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:05,016
- What else?
- l was 1 3.

499
00:54:05,088 --> 00:54:07,022
He was dark, very thin.

500
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:10,850
l can see him. Big nose.

501
00:54:10,928 --> 00:54:11,952
A big romance.

502
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:16,159
l fell in love with him
when l heard him playing piano.

503
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:18,895
You mean, when he first
got into your knickers.

504
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:22,302
He was a child prodigy.
He was playing with both hands.

505
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:24,306
l`ll bet he was.

506
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:27,738
Probably getting his kicks.

507
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:31,247
- We were dying of heat.
- Oh, yeah.

508
00:54:31,315 --> 00:54:33,545
Good excuse. What else?

509
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:37,451
ln the afternoon,
when the grown-ups were napping--

510
00:54:37,521 --> 00:54:40,285
- You started grabbing his joint.
- You`re crazy!

511
00:54:40,357 --> 00:54:42,723
- Well, he touched you.
- l never let him. Never.

512
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:49,291
Liar, liar, pants on fire,
nose as long as a telephone wire.

513
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:51,300
You mean to tell me
that he didn`t touch you?

514
00:54:51,368 --> 00:54:55,304
Look me straight in the face
and say ''He didn`t touch me once.''

515
00:54:56,373 --> 00:54:58,841
No, he touched me,
but the way he did it.

516
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:03,676
Aha! The way he did it.
Okay, what did he do?

517
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:06,545
Behind the house
there were two trees:

518
00:55:06,617 --> 00:55:09,051
a plantain tree and a chestnut.

519
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:13,078
l sat under the plantain tree
and he sat under the chestnut.

520
00:55:13,156 --> 00:55:16,853
And one, two, three,
we each began to masturbate.

521
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:19,623
The first who came won.

522
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:30,700
Why don`t you listen to me?

523
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:33,538
When did you first come?
How old were you?

524
00:55:34,678 --> 00:55:36,839
The first time?

525
00:55:36,913 --> 00:55:39,780
l was very late for school.

526
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:42,683
l began running downhill.

527
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:47,417
Suddenly, l felt
a strong sensation here.

528
00:55:48,592 --> 00:55:50,890
l came as l ran.

529
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:53,759
Then l ran faster and faster,
and the more l ran...

530
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,457
the more l came.

531
00:55:57,034 --> 00:56:00,197
Two days later
l tried running again...

532
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,204
but no dice.

533
00:56:07,277 --> 00:56:09,142
Why don`t you listen to me?

534
00:56:11,381 --> 00:56:14,680
You know, it seems to me
l`m talking to the wall.

535
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:17,311
Your solitude weighs on me,
you know?

536
00:56:17,387 --> 00:56:19,412
lt isn`t indulgent or generous.

537
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,083
You`re an egoist!

538
00:56:25,896 --> 00:56:28,160
l can be by myself too,
you know.

539
00:59:15,165 --> 00:59:17,633
We can`t sleep with this music.

540
00:59:19,236 --> 00:59:23,138
l came to this hotel
for one night...

541
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:25,538
and stayed for five years.

542
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:30,546
When we had the hotel
people came here to sleep.

543
00:59:30,614 --> 00:59:33,105
Now they do anything.

544
00:59:33,183 --> 00:59:37,950
They hide out, take drugs,
play music.

545
00:59:43,293 --> 00:59:45,124
Remove that hand.

546
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:47,891
You`re not alone.
l`m here.

547
00:59:53,837 --> 00:59:55,566
You`re crazy!

548
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:57,368
l`m beginning to understand.

549
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,466
You want me to stop the music?

550
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:02,871
Okay.

551
01:00:02,946 --> 01:00:04,914
l`ll make him shut up.

552
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:08,248
What are you doing, Paul?

553
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,015
What`s the matter, Mother?
Are you upset? Don`t be upset.

554
01:00:12,088 --> 01:00:14,022
Nothing really
to be upset about.

555
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:18,550
lt takes so little to make them afraid.
You wanna know what they`re afraid of?

556
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:20,789
They`re afraid of the dark.
lmagine that.

557
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:23,128
l want you to meet my friend.

558
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:24,461
Turn on the light.

559
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:27,526
You ought to meet
a few clients of the hotel.

560
01:00:27,604 --> 01:00:30,198
Folks, l`d like you
to say hello to Mom.

561
01:00:30,273 --> 01:00:33,674
Mom, this is Mr.Juicehead Junkie.

562
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:36,143
And Mr. Saxophone...

563
01:00:36,212 --> 01:00:38,680
he`s our connection, Mom.

564
01:00:38,748 --> 01:00:40,682
Gives us some hard stuff.

565
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:45,744
And right here is the beautiful
Miss Blow Job of 1 933.

566
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:49,690
She`s still making a few points
when she takes her teeth out.

567
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:51,852
- Light, Paul.
- Don`t you want to say hello?

568
01:00:51,928 --> 01:00:54,089
This is Mom.

569
01:00:54,164 --> 01:00:57,099
You afraid of the dark, Mom?
She`s afraid of the dark.

570
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,795
Oh, well, poor thing.
All right, sweetheart.

571
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:04,499
l`ll take care of you. Don`t worry.
l`ll give you a little light.

572
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:06,508
Don`t you worry about a thing.

573
01:01:12,682 --> 01:01:14,616
Let`s go back to bed.

574
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:30,299
- Good night, Madam.
- Good night.

575
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:37,102
Good night, Marcel.

576
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:40,108
Good night, Paul.

577
01:01:51,454 --> 01:01:53,422
Who is it?

578
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:55,219
You like?

579
01:01:56,393 --> 01:01:58,827
He was Rosa`s lover.

580
01:02:32,395 --> 01:02:35,956
What am l doing
in this apartment with you?

581
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:37,522
Love?

582
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,033
Well...

583
01:02:40,203 --> 01:02:43,036
let`s say we`re just taking...

584
01:02:43,106 --> 01:02:46,041
a flying fuck
at a rolling doughnut.

585
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:49,509
So you think l`m a ''wore.''

586
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:52,514
l think you`re a what?
A what? A ''wore''?

587
01:02:52,582 --> 01:02:55,073
- A ''wore.''
- You mean ''whore,'' right?

588
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:57,381
Yes. A whore.

589
01:02:57,454 --> 01:03:01,254
No, you`re just a dear
old-fashioned girl trying to get along.

590
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:07,456
Why were you
going through my pockets?

591
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:10,055
To find out who you are.

592
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:14,636
- Yes.
- Well, if you look real close...

593
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:17,764
you`ll see me
hiding behind my zipper.

594
01:03:19,642 --> 01:03:24,170
Well, we know that he buys clothes
in some big store.

595
01:03:24,247 --> 01:03:26,238
That`s not much...

596
01:03:26,316 --> 01:03:28,250
but it`s a beginning.

597
01:03:29,452 --> 01:03:31,920
That`s not a beginning.
That`s a finish.

598
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:35,389
Well, okay.
Let`s forget it.

599
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:36,891
How old are you?

600
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,894
l`ll be 93 this weekend.

601
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:40,896
Oh!
You don`t look it.

602
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:43,125
Thank you.

603
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:45,633
- Have you been in college?
- Oh, yeah.

604
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,104
Yeah, l went to...

605
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:52,164
the University of Congo.

606
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:54,369
- Studied whale fucking.
- Wow.

607
01:03:55,311 --> 01:03:58,246
Barbers don`t usually
go to university.

608
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:03,510
Are you telling me
that l look like a barber?

609
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:06,578
No, but that`s a razor`s barber.

610
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:09,022
That`s a barber`s razor.

611
01:04:09,092 --> 01:04:11,822
Barber`s razors.
Yes.

612
01:04:11,895 --> 01:04:13,829
Or a madman`s.

613
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,101
So you want to cut me up?

614
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:22,104
No.

615
01:04:22,172 --> 01:04:25,232
That would be like
writing my name on your face.

616
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:27,538
Like they do to slaves?

617
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:30,545
Slaves are branded on the ass,
and l want you free.

618
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:32,308
Free?
l`m not free.

619
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:39,119
You want to know why you don`t
want to know anything about me?

620
01:04:39,189 --> 01:04:41,817
- Because you hate women.
- Oh, really?

621
01:04:41,891 --> 01:04:44,325
What have they ever done to you?

622
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:48,497
Well...

623
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:51,659
either they always pretend
to know who l am...

624
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:55,670
or they pretend that l don`t know
who they are, and that`s very boring.

625
01:04:58,241 --> 01:05:01,677
l`m not afraid to say who l am.
l`m 20 years old--

626
01:05:01,744 --> 01:05:04,076
No! l--
Jesus Christ.

627
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:05,842
Where`s your brain?

628
01:05:08,918 --> 01:05:10,010
Shut up.

629
01:05:12,288 --> 01:05:13,880
Get it?

630
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:19,561
l know it`s tough,
but you`re gonna have to bear it.

631
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:23,164
You know, these sinks
are really beautiful.

632
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:27,893
They`re very rare.
You don`t find them anymore.

633
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:31,407
l think it`s these sinks
that let you stay together.

634
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:34,876
Hmm? Don`t you think?

635
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,746
What`s that?
What`s all this?

636
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:43,351
Mad? Mad? Huh?
Mad? Mad?

637
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,594
l think l`m happy with you.

638
01:05:57,267 --> 01:06:01,135
Encore! Do it again!

639
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:03,138
Again!

640
01:06:06,276 --> 01:06:08,210
l am coming.
l am ready.

641
01:06:09,812 --> 01:06:11,746
Are we going together?

642
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:25,822
He is a jerk.
He didn`t even say bye!

643
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:06,129
What are you doing here?

644
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:08,534
l`m coming. l`m flying.

645
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:09,536
Stay there!

646
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:12,005
Why didn`t you talk
on the phone?

647
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:14,134
What`s the matter?

648
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:16,144
Find another girl for your film.

649
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:19,071
But why?

650
01:07:19,148 --> 01:07:22,311
You take advantage of me.

651
01:07:22,385 --> 01:07:25,479
You make me do things
l`ve never done.

652
01:07:25,555 --> 01:07:28,115
You`re stealing my time.

653
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:31,285
You make me do
whatever you want.

654
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:34,963
The film is over.

655
01:07:45,308 --> 01:07:47,469
l`m tired of having
my mind raped!

656
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:37,790
Come in.

657
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,886
You wanted to talk to me?
Do.

658
01:08:40,963 --> 01:08:46,401
But... ''l didn`t come here
to cry with you.''

659
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:49,404
lt bothers you
if l keep working?

660
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:53,408
lt distracts me
after what happened.

661
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:00,611
ldentical.

662
01:09:00,683 --> 01:09:03,618
- Rose wanted them identical.
- Our bathrobes.

663
01:09:05,087 --> 01:09:08,318
You can`t tell me anything
l don`t already know.

664
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:10,325
Same color, same design.

665
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:14,462
Yes, yes.

666
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:18,989
You are precise.

667
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:22,998
l`m wondering why...

668
01:09:23,072 --> 01:09:26,564
you save
these newspaper clippings.

669
01:09:26,642 --> 01:09:28,735
ls it a job or a hobby?

670
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:33,214
l don`t like the word ''hobby.''

671
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:36,046
lt`s a job
to roll out the salary.

672
01:09:36,118 --> 01:09:39,315
Then it`s serious.

673
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:43,620
lt`s a job that makes you read.
Very instructive.

674
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:46,594
Be sincere.

675
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:50,797
Didn`t you know
we had identical bathrobes?

676
01:09:56,305 --> 01:09:58,273
We have lots of things
in common.

677
01:10:02,111 --> 01:10:03,544
l know everything.

678
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:08,212
Rose often told me about you.

679
01:10:10,553 --> 01:10:14,717
l don`t think there are
many such marriages.

680
01:10:16,092 --> 01:10:17,525
lt`s strange.

681
01:10:21,397 --> 01:10:22,830
l`m thirsty.

682
01:10:27,069 --> 01:10:30,061
- A sip of bourbon?
- Wait.

683
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:43,443
Here`s the ''bourbon.''

684
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:51,625
Another present from Rose?

685
01:10:53,996 --> 01:10:59,195
l don`t like it,
but Rose always wanted it around.

686
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:09,268
l`ve often wondered...

687
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,315
if by these details...

688
01:11:14,383 --> 01:11:16,317
by certain unimportant things...

689
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,945
one can explain...

690
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:22,547
understand together.

691
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,183
Together?

692
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,889
For almost a year Rose and l,
without passion...

693
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:30,660
but regularly--

694
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:32,963
l thought l knew her
as one can know--

695
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:34,161
One`s mistress.

696
01:11:34,236 --> 01:11:38,764
For example,
a while ago something happened...

697
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:40,502
l couldn`t explain.

698
01:11:44,347 --> 01:11:46,406
Look there on the wall.

699
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:51,751
She climbed up on the wall...

700
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:56,825
and tried to tear off the paper
with her hands.

701
01:11:58,995 --> 01:12:01,930
l stopped her.
She was ruining her nails.

702
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:06,367
She did it with a strange...

703
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:08,767
violence.

704
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:12,273
l had never seen her like that.

705
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:17,445
Our room is painted white.

706
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:21,472
She wanted it different
from the others...

707
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,484
so it would seem like...

708
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:27,685
a normal house.

709
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:31,386
She wanted to change in here too...

710
01:12:32,962 --> 01:12:35,396
and she`d begun with the walls.

711
01:12:39,869 --> 01:12:41,461
A fever blister.

712
01:12:41,537 --> 01:12:42,970
Shit.

713
01:12:46,308 --> 01:12:49,072
You were lucky enough to--

714
01:12:49,145 --> 01:12:51,010
to be--

715
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,140
You must have been a good man...

716
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:56,150
20 years ago.

717
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,754
Not as much as you.

718
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:04,049
You have all your hair.

719
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:08,222
l have to cut it often
and wash it.

720
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:10,629
l wash my hair often.

721
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,964
Do you have massages?

722
01:13:16,405 --> 01:13:18,339
You`re in good shape.

723
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:22,740
What do you do for the belly?

724
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:24,746
That`s my problem.

725
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:28,049
Here.

726
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:30,551
- l have a secret.
- What?

727
01:13:39,562 --> 01:13:41,792
Thinking of leaving?

728
01:13:41,864 --> 01:13:43,456
The suitcase.

729
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:46,123
America.

730
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:48,500
Why did she betray you with me?

731
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:52,507
You don`t think Rose
killed herself?

732
01:13:56,378 --> 01:14:00,542
lt`s difficult for me, too,
to believe it.

733
01:14:02,485 --> 01:14:04,180
Here`s my secret.

734
01:14:05,454 --> 01:14:08,150
Thirty times every morning.

735
01:14:16,866 --> 01:14:18,128
Really, Marcello...

736
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:24,906
l wonder what she ever saw in you.

737
01:14:29,745 --> 01:14:31,178
Are you here?

738
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:35,849
Nobody here?

739
01:14:47,496 --> 01:14:49,088
Hi, monster.

740
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:05,537
Something wrong?

741
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:09,050
- There`s some butter in the kitchen.
- So you`re here.

742
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:11,985
- Why didn`t you answer?
- Go get the butter.

743
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:14,386
l have a cab downstairs waiting.

744
01:15:14,456 --> 01:15:16,390
Go get the butter.

745
01:15:28,604 --> 01:15:30,902
lt makes me crazy...

746
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:35,410
that you`re so damn sure
that l`d come back here.

747
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:37,502
What do you think?

748
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,448
That an American
on the floor in an empty house...

749
01:15:41,517 --> 01:15:44,452
eating cheese and drinking water
is interesting?

750
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:49,618
What`s under here?

751
01:15:50,526 --> 01:15:51,959
An empty space.

752
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:53,289
Can you hear it?

753
01:15:53,362 --> 01:15:56,354
- lt`s hollow.
- Yeah. That`s a hiding place.

754
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:04,831
- Don`t open it.
- Why not?

755
01:16:04,907 --> 01:16:08,035
l don`t know.
Don`t open it.

756
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:11,341
What about that?
Can l open that?

757
01:16:17,052 --> 01:16:18,781
Wait a minute.

758
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:20,788
Maybe there`s jewels in it.

759
01:16:23,459 --> 01:16:25,188
Maybe there`s gold.

760
01:16:28,397 --> 01:16:30,388
- You afraid?
- No.

761
01:16:30,466 --> 01:16:32,866
No?

762
01:16:36,138 --> 01:16:38,072
You`re always afraid.

763
01:16:40,876 --> 01:16:44,607
No, but maybe there is
some family secrets inside.

764
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,204
Family secrets?

765
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:51,018
l`ll tell you about
family secrets.

766
01:16:53,522 --> 01:16:54,989
What are you doing here?

767
01:16:55,057 --> 01:16:57,992
l`m gonna tell you about the family.

768
01:17:03,666 --> 01:17:06,100
A holy institution...

769
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:08,329
meant to breed virtue
in savages.

770
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:15,542
l want you to
repeat it after me.

771
01:17:18,547 --> 01:17:20,481
Repeat it. Say it.

772
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:22,676
A holy family...

773
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,217
Go on, say it.

774
01:17:26,288 --> 01:17:31,225
Go on. Holy family.
Church of good citizens.

775
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:32,726
Church...

776
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:36,397
Of good citizens.

777
01:17:41,236 --> 01:17:43,761
Say it. Say it.

778
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:47,070
The children are tortured
until they tell their first lie.

779
01:17:47,142 --> 01:17:48,575
The children...

780
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:51,145
are tortured...

781
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:58,319
Where the world is broken
by repression.

782
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:03,857
Where freedom...

783
01:18:07,596 --> 01:18:09,894
is assassinated--

784
01:18:09,965 --> 01:18:12,900
Where freedom is assassinated
by egotism.

785
01:18:18,207 --> 01:18:19,640
Family.

786
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:24,212
You...

787
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:33,551
You...

788
01:18:33,622 --> 01:18:35,055
fucking--

789
01:18:36,325 --> 01:18:38,384
You fucking...

790
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,018
family.

791
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,525
You fucking family.

792
01:18:47,403 --> 01:18:48,995
Oh, God.

793
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:50,504
Jesus.

794
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:31,545
Shit!

795
01:19:35,918 --> 01:19:37,351
Hey, you.

796
01:19:39,254 --> 01:19:40,687
Yes, you.

797
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,991
l`ve got a surprise for you.

798
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:49,758
- What?
- l`ve got a surprise for you.

799
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:52,432
That`s good.

800
01:19:54,136 --> 01:19:56,070
l like surprises.

801
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:11,075
What is it?

802
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:14,088
Music.
But l don`t know how to work it.

803
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,834
Did you enjoy that?

804
01:21:05,607 --> 01:21:07,541
Know why l sent everyone away?

805
01:21:08,844 --> 01:21:12,336
Because you want to be
alone with me.

806
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:14,678
And why?

807
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,685
Because you have something
important to tell me.

808
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:21,189
lt`s something very important.

809
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:22,985
Happy or sad?

810
01:21:23,058 --> 01:21:24,491
lt`s a secret.

811
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,084
Then it`s happy.

812
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:27,753
What kind of secret?

813
01:21:27,829 --> 01:21:30,730
A secret between a man...

814
01:21:30,799 --> 01:21:31,993
and a woman.

815
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:33,830
Dirt or love?

816
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,197
Love.
And it`s not everything.

817
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:41,208
A love secret that isn`t everything?
What is it?

818
01:21:44,713 --> 01:21:47,307
That in a week
l`m marrying you.

819
01:21:47,382 --> 01:21:48,644
What?

820
01:21:48,717 --> 01:21:50,446
l`m marrying you!

821
01:21:50,519 --> 01:21:53,181
- l`m marrying you!
- Marrying me?

822
01:21:53,255 --> 01:21:56,190
- Let`s get married?
- Yes. Let`s get married!

823
01:22:02,497 --> 01:22:05,432
- Shall we marry or not?
- Yes, let`s get married.

824
01:22:10,272 --> 01:22:11,569
Yes or no?

825
01:22:20,549 --> 01:22:23,177
Send everything to the country.

826
01:22:23,252 --> 01:22:25,311
What do you think,Jeanne?

827
01:22:25,387 --> 01:22:28,288
Olympia will be happy.

828
01:22:28,357 --> 01:22:30,291
l went with Tom.

829
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,558
He`s preparing a family museum.

830
01:22:37,366 --> 01:22:39,266
Papa`s boots, no.

831
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:41,564
l`ll keep them.

832
01:22:42,704 --> 01:22:44,968
They give me strange shivers.

833
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:55,143
These military things
never get old.

834
01:22:56,218 --> 01:23:00,985
How heavy it was
when Papa taught me to shoot.

835
01:23:01,056 --> 01:23:02,489
l`ll keep that.

836
01:23:02,557 --> 01:23:06,789
lt`s a good idea
to have a weapon in the house.

837
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:10,195
- But if you don`t know how to use it?
- lt`s enough to have it.

838
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:12,199
lt frightens.

839
01:23:16,905 --> 01:23:18,839
You saved everything of Papa`s.

840
01:23:20,175 --> 01:23:22,541
This was his orderly.

841
01:23:24,513 --> 01:23:26,913
A fine example of a Berber.

842
01:23:26,982 --> 01:23:32,181
A strong race,
but as servants-- disastrous.

843
01:23:33,155 --> 01:23:36,147
Send everything to the country.

844
01:23:36,224 --> 01:23:38,749
Enough accumulating.

845
01:23:38,827 --> 01:23:42,092
Don`t worry.
Soon you`ll have lots of space.

846
01:23:42,164 --> 01:23:44,223
What`s that mean?

847
01:23:44,299 --> 01:23:45,732
Nothing.

848
01:23:48,537 --> 01:23:52,667
Madame, the colonel`s lady,
announces...

849
01:23:52,741 --> 01:23:53,833
What?

850
01:23:56,144 --> 01:23:58,510
that in these solemn days...

851
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,844
What solemn days?

852
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,941
l`m getting married in a week.

853
01:24:04,019 --> 01:24:05,509
What did you say?

854
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:07,248
To Tom! ln a week!

855
01:24:07,322 --> 01:24:09,756
- What?
- Tom!

856
01:24:09,825 --> 01:24:12,953
- ln one week!
- What are you doing in a week?

857
01:24:13,829 --> 01:24:15,763
Rolling.
Five... two.

858
01:24:19,134 --> 01:24:21,625
Come forward.
Start shooting.

859
01:24:21,703 --> 01:24:23,227
Yes, yes, we are coming.

860
01:24:23,305 --> 01:24:25,296
Wait. Push your arm.

861
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:29,575
How do you see marriage?

862
01:24:29,644 --> 01:24:31,578
- The marriage?
- Yes.

863
01:24:31,646 --> 01:24:34,206
l see it everywhere.
Always.

864
01:24:34,282 --> 01:24:35,874
Everywhere?

865
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:38,886
On walls, on housefronts.

866
01:24:40,589 --> 01:24:41,988
Yes, on posters.

867
01:24:42,057 --> 01:24:44,082
What do the posters say?

868
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,059
They talk about cars...

869
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:48,153
canned meat, cigarettes.

870
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:50,755
No, the subject is
the young couple...

871
01:24:50,832 --> 01:24:53,198
before marriage,
without children.

872
01:24:53,268 --> 01:24:56,726
Then, after the marriage,
with the children.

873
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:58,067
Marriage, in short.

874
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,700
The ideal, successful marriage...

875
01:25:00,776 --> 01:25:02,801
isn`t anymore the old style,
in church...

876
01:25:02,878 --> 01:25:05,642
with a depressed
and a complaining wife.

877
01:25:05,714 --> 01:25:09,548
Today, the advertising marriage
is smiling.

878
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:12,553
Smiling?
ln the posters.

879
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:17,149
But why not take
the poster marriage seriously?

880
01:25:17,225 --> 01:25:19,125
Marriage.
The pop marriage.

881
01:25:21,396 --> 01:25:23,057
Pop.

882
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:24,860
There`s the formula.

883
01:25:24,933 --> 01:25:28,528
For pop youth, pop marriage.

884
01:25:28,603 --> 01:25:32,630
And if it doesn`t work?

885
01:25:32,707 --> 01:25:34,402
Fix it like a car.

886
01:25:35,343 --> 01:25:38,710
The couple are two workmen
in overalls...

887
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,748
repairing a motor.

888
01:25:40,816 --> 01:25:43,444
And in case of adultery,
what happens?

889
01:25:43,518 --> 01:25:47,386
lnstead of two workmen,
there are three or four.

890
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:51,114
And love?

891
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:52,490
ls love pop too?

892
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:54,495
No.
Love is not pop.

893
01:25:54,563 --> 01:25:56,758
lf it is not pop,
what is it?

894
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,497
The workmen
go to a secret place.

895
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:04,664
They take off their overalls,
becoming men and women again...

896
01:26:04,739 --> 01:26:06,604
and make love.

897
01:26:19,454 --> 01:26:21,217
You`re superb!

898
01:26:21,289 --> 01:26:24,019
lt`s the dress
that makes the bride.

899
01:26:25,126 --> 01:26:27,526
You`re better
than Rita Hayworth...

900
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:29,530
than Joan Crawford...

901
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:33,259
Kim Novak...

902
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:35,530
Lauren Bacall...

903
01:26:35,604 --> 01:26:39,938
Ava Gardner
when she loved Mickey Rooney!

904
01:26:40,008 --> 01:26:43,535
What are you doing?
Stop!

905
01:26:43,612 --> 01:26:46,877
Why don`t you film with the rain?
You are crazy!

906
01:26:57,025 --> 01:26:59,186
- Where`s Jeanne?
- She ran out.

907
01:26:59,261 --> 01:27:01,354
Where`d she go in this rain?

908
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:34,954
Pardon me!

909
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:36,964
Forgive me!

910
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,234
l wanted to leave you.
l could not.

911
01:27:43,838 --> 01:27:46,500
l wanted to leave you,
and l couldn`t.

912
01:27:46,575 --> 01:27:48,805
l can`t.

913
01:27:48,877 --> 01:27:50,811
l can`t leave you.
Understand?

914
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,814
Do you still want me?

915
01:28:00,722 --> 01:28:02,553
Bang.

916
01:28:26,881 --> 01:28:30,647
Oh, there once was a man

917
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,880
And he had an old sow

918
01:28:38,793 --> 01:28:40,727
You know, you`re wet.

919
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:02,782
A rat.

920
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:05,115
lt`s only a rat.

921
01:29:05,186 --> 01:29:07,620
There`s more rats in Paris
than people.

922
01:29:10,058 --> 01:29:11,889
- l want to go!
- Wait. Wait.

923
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:15,896
Don`t you want a bite first?
You don`t want to run and eat.

924
01:29:15,964 --> 01:29:17,693
This is the end!

925
01:29:17,766 --> 01:29:19,700
No, this is the end.

926
01:29:19,768 --> 01:29:22,931
But l like to start with the head.
That`s the best part.

927
01:29:23,004 --> 01:29:24,938
Are you sure you won`t have any?

928
01:29:25,006 --> 01:29:26,303
Okay.

929
01:29:30,178 --> 01:29:33,443
- What`s the matter? You don`t dig rat?
- l want to go!

930
01:29:33,515 --> 01:29:37,007
l can`t make love in this bed anymore.
l can`t.

931
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:39,781
lt`s disgusting. Nauseating.

932
01:29:39,854 --> 01:29:44,553
Well, we`ll fuck on the radiator
or standing on the mantle.

933
01:29:44,626 --> 01:29:48,562
l gotta get some mayonnaise for this.
lt really is good with mayonnaise.

934
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,535
And l`ll save the asshole for you.

935
01:29:57,372 --> 01:29:59,772
A rat`s asshole in mayonnaise!

936
01:29:59,841 --> 01:30:03,572
l want to get out of here.
l want to go away.

937
01:30:03,645 --> 01:30:06,671
l can`t take it anymore here.

938
01:30:06,748 --> 01:30:09,012
l`m going away.

939
01:30:11,386 --> 01:30:14,480
l`m never coming back.
Never.

940
01:30:17,425 --> 01:30:19,359
Quo vadis, baby?

941
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:24,194
l forgot to tell you something.

942
01:30:24,265 --> 01:30:26,199
l fell in love with somebody.

943
01:30:26,267 --> 01:30:29,430
Oh, isn`t that wonderful?
Oh, gosh.

944
01:30:30,672 --> 01:30:33,937
You`re gonna have to
get out of these wet duds.

945
01:30:34,008 --> 01:30:36,442
And l`m going to
make love with him.

946
01:30:39,514 --> 01:30:40,947
Well...

947
01:30:42,183 --> 01:30:45,118
first you have to
take a hot bath.

948
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:52,426
`Cause if you don`t,
you`re gonna get pneumonia. Right?

949
01:30:56,364 --> 01:30:58,298
Then you know what happens?

950
01:30:58,366 --> 01:31:01,995
You get pneumonia, and then
you know what happens? You die.

951
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:06,468
You know what happens then,
when you die?

952
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,975
l get to fuck the dead rat.

953
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:17,718
- Give me the soap.
- l`m in love.

954
01:31:17,786 --> 01:31:20,482
You`re in love?
How delightful.

955
01:31:21,556 --> 01:31:25,322
l`m in love! l`m in love!
You understand?

956
01:31:25,393 --> 01:31:27,554
l`m in love! l`m in love!

957
01:31:33,635 --> 01:31:35,569
You know, you`re old.

958
01:31:35,637 --> 01:31:39,437
- And you`re getting fat.
- Fat, is it? How unkind.

959
01:31:39,507 --> 01:31:43,910
Half of your hair is out.
The other half is almost white.

960
01:31:43,978 --> 01:31:48,074
ln ten years you`re gonna be
playing soccer with your tits.

961
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:50,884
You know what l`ll be doing?

962
01:31:50,952 --> 01:31:52,977
You will be in a wheelchair.

963
01:31:54,088 --> 01:31:55,350
Well, maybe.

964
01:31:55,423 --> 01:32:00,087
But l`ll be smirking and giggling
all the way to eternity.

965
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:01,594
How poetic.

966
01:32:01,663 --> 01:32:04,962
But, please, before you go
wash my feet.

967
01:32:05,033 --> 01:32:06,466
Okay.

968
01:32:08,136 --> 01:32:09,797
Noblesse oblige.

969
01:32:14,642 --> 01:32:17,907
You know, he and l, we make love.

970
01:32:17,979 --> 01:32:20,038
Oh, really?

971
01:32:20,114 --> 01:32:22,548
That`s wonderful.
ls he a good fucker?

972
01:32:22,617 --> 01:32:24,050
Magnificent.

973
01:32:26,621 --> 01:32:28,612
You know, you`re a jerk.

974
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:34,094
`Cause the best fucking you`re gonna get
is right here in this apartment.

975
01:32:34,162 --> 01:32:35,595
Stand up.

976
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:40,133
He`s full of mysteries.

977
01:32:41,769 --> 01:32:43,964
Give me the soap.

978
01:32:44,038 --> 01:32:46,563
Listen, you dumb dodo...

979
01:32:46,641 --> 01:32:51,044
all the mysteries that you`re ever
gonna know in life are right here.

980
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:54,673
He`s like everybody,
but at the same time he`s different.

981
01:32:56,551 --> 01:32:58,485
You mean, like everybody.

982
01:32:58,553 --> 01:33:00,885
Yeah, but even he frightens me.

983
01:33:03,925 --> 01:33:05,859
What is he, your local pimp?

984
01:33:05,927 --> 01:33:09,021
He could be.
He looks it.

985
01:33:09,097 --> 01:33:12,362
- You know why l`m in love with him?
- l can`t wait.

986
01:33:12,433 --> 01:33:16,233
Because he knows how to make me
fall in love with him.

987
01:33:16,304 --> 01:33:19,501
Oh. You want this man that you love
to protect you and take care of you.

988
01:33:19,574 --> 01:33:21,166
Yeah.

989
01:33:21,242 --> 01:33:24,643
You want this golden,
shining, powerful warrior...

990
01:33:24,712 --> 01:33:28,341
to build a fortress
that you can hide in...

991
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:31,874
so you don`t ever
have to be afraid...

992
01:33:31,953 --> 01:33:34,547
or feel lonely or feel empty.

993
01:33:34,622 --> 01:33:36,715
- That`s what you want?
- Yes.

994
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:38,725
Well, you`ll never find him.

995
01:33:38,793 --> 01:33:40,886
But l`ve found this man.

996
01:33:40,962 --> 01:33:44,398
Then it won`t be long until he`ll
want you to build a fortress for him...

997
01:33:44,465 --> 01:33:47,866
out of your tits and your cunt
and your hair and your smile...

998
01:33:47,936 --> 01:33:49,870
and the way you smell.

999
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:55,102
Someplace where he can feel
comfortable enough and secure enough...

1000
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:58,577
so that he can worship
in front of the altar of his own prick.

1001
01:33:58,646 --> 01:34:00,580
But l`ve found this man.

1002
01:34:00,648 --> 01:34:01,910
No. You`re alone.

1003
01:34:01,983 --> 01:34:03,974
You`re all alone...

1004
01:34:04,052 --> 01:34:07,249
and you won`t be able to be free
of that feeling of being alone...

1005
01:34:07,322 --> 01:34:09,381
until you look death
right in the face.

1006
01:34:09,457 --> 01:34:14,156
That sounds like bullshit,
some romantic crap...

1007
01:34:14,228 --> 01:34:18,062
until you go
right up into the ass of death.

1008
01:34:18,132 --> 01:34:20,066
Right up in his ass.

1009
01:34:20,134 --> 01:34:23,297
Till you find the womb of fear.

1010
01:34:23,371 --> 01:34:24,998
And then maybe...

1011
01:34:26,507 --> 01:34:29,101
maybe then
you`ll be able to find him.

1012
01:34:29,177 --> 01:34:31,111
But l`ve found this man.

1013
01:34:31,179 --> 01:34:34,808
He`s you.
You are that man.

1014
01:34:43,124 --> 01:34:45,115
Give me the scissors.

1015
01:34:45,193 --> 01:34:47,718
- What?
- Give me the fingernail scissors.

1016
01:34:55,536 --> 01:35:00,735
No. l want you to cut
the fingernails on your right hand.

1017
01:35:00,808 --> 01:35:02,742
These two.

1018
01:35:10,051 --> 01:35:11,643
That`s it.

1019
01:35:16,924 --> 01:35:19,154
Put your fingers up my ass.

1020
01:35:19,227 --> 01:35:20,319
What?

1021
01:35:20,395 --> 01:35:23,330
Put your fingers up my ass.
Are you deaf?

1022
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:27,029
Go on.

1023
01:35:31,105 --> 01:35:33,266
l`m gonna get a pig...

1024
01:35:33,341 --> 01:35:37,004
and l`m gonna have the pig
fuck you.

1025
01:35:37,078 --> 01:35:40,013
l want the pig
to vomit in your face...

1026
01:35:40,081 --> 01:35:43,073
and l want you
to swallow the vomit.

1027
01:35:43,151 --> 01:35:45,142
- You gonna do that for me?
- Yeah.

1028
01:35:47,622 --> 01:35:51,615
l want the pig to die
while you`re fucking him.

1029
01:35:51,692 --> 01:35:56,789
Then you have to go behind it
and smell the dying farts of the pig.

1030
01:35:58,433 --> 01:36:01,925
- Are you gonna do all that for me?
- Yes, and more than that!

1031
01:36:02,003 --> 01:36:04,938
And worse.
Worse than before.

1032
01:36:14,582 --> 01:36:17,745
You look ridiculous
in that makeup.

1033
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:20,253
Like the caricature
of a whore.

1034
01:36:23,357 --> 01:36:25,791
A little touch of mommy
in the night.

1035
01:36:32,934 --> 01:36:35,698
Fake Ophelia
drowned in the bathtub.

1036
01:36:42,844 --> 01:36:46,177
l wish you could see yourself.
You`d really laugh.

1037
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:50,083
You`re your mother`s masterpiece.

1038
01:36:58,059 --> 01:37:00,323
Oh, Christ.

1039
01:37:00,394 --> 01:37:03,830
There`s too many fucking flowers
in this place. l can`t breathe.

1040
01:37:07,902 --> 01:37:11,235
You know, in the top of the closet,
cardboard box...

1041
01:37:11,305 --> 01:37:13,671
l found all your--

1042
01:37:13,741 --> 01:37:16,335
l found all your little goodies.

1043
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:18,344
Pens, key chains...

1044
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,875
foreign money, French ticklers...

1045
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:23,883
the whole shot.

1046
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,053
Even a clergyman`s collar.

1047
01:37:28,256 --> 01:37:32,192
l didn`t know you collected all
those little knickknacks left behind.

1048
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:38,164
Even if a husband lives...

1049
01:37:39,433 --> 01:37:41,424
200 fucking years...

1050
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:46,806
he`s never gonna be able to discover
his wife`s real nature.

1051
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:52,502
l might be able
to comprehend the universe...

1052
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:54,013
but...

1053
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:59,842
l`ll never discover
the truth about you. Never.

1054
01:38:00,988 --> 01:38:03,218
l mean, who the hell were you?

1055
01:38:05,893 --> 01:38:08,191
Remember that day...

1056
01:38:08,262 --> 01:38:10,992
the first day l was there?

1057
01:38:11,065 --> 01:38:15,399
l knew l couldn`t get into
your pants unless l said--

1058
01:38:17,104 --> 01:38:19,504
What did l say?
Oh, yes.

1059
01:38:21,242 --> 01:38:24,177
''May l have my bill, please?
l have to leave.''

1060
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,413
Remember?

1061
01:38:31,852 --> 01:38:33,786
Last night l...

1062
01:38:35,223 --> 01:38:38,158
l ripped off the lights
on your mother...

1063
01:38:39,427 --> 01:38:41,691
and the whole joint
went bananas.

1064
01:38:45,299 --> 01:38:49,497
All your guests,
as you used to call them--

1065
01:38:53,741 --> 01:38:57,177
Well, l guess that includes me,
doesn`t it?

1066
01:38:57,245 --> 01:38:58,906
Huh?

1067
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:01,448
lt does include me,
doesn`t it?

1068
01:39:01,515 --> 01:39:05,281
For five years l was more
a guest in this fucking flophouse...

1069
01:39:05,353 --> 01:39:07,218
than a husband.

1070
01:39:07,288 --> 01:39:09,051
With privileges, of course.

1071
01:39:10,124 --> 01:39:12,649
Then, to help me understand...

1072
01:39:12,727 --> 01:39:14,888
you let me inherit Marcel...

1073
01:39:14,962 --> 01:39:18,398
the husband`s double
whose room was the double of ours.

1074
01:39:19,467 --> 01:39:20,957
And you know what?

1075
01:39:21,035 --> 01:39:25,233
l didn`t even have the guts
to ask him...

1076
01:39:25,306 --> 01:39:29,834
if the same numbers you and l did
were the same numbers you did with him.

1077
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:34,313
Our marriage was nothing more
than a foxhole for you...

1078
01:39:34,382 --> 01:39:39,115
and all it took for you to get out was
a 35-cent razor and a tub full of water.

1079
01:39:39,186 --> 01:39:42,849
You cheap, goddamn fucking,
godforsaken whore.

1080
01:39:42,923 --> 01:39:44,857
l hope you rot in hell.

1081
01:39:44,925 --> 01:39:50,261
You`re worse than the dirtiest street
pig anyone could find, and you know why?

1082
01:39:50,331 --> 01:39:52,856
You know why?
Because you lied.

1083
01:39:52,933 --> 01:39:55,868
You lied to me,
and l trusted you.

1084
01:39:55,936 --> 01:39:57,870
You knew you were lying.

1085
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,974
Tell me you didn`t lie.

1086
01:40:02,143 --> 01:40:04,441
Haven`t you got anything
to say about that?

1087
01:40:04,512 --> 01:40:07,913
You can think up something,
can`t you? Huh?

1088
01:40:07,982 --> 01:40:11,076
Go on, tell me something.
Go on, smile, you cunt.

1089
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,514
Go on.
Tell me something sweet.

1090
01:40:15,589 --> 01:40:18,888
Smile at me and say
that l just misunderstood.

1091
01:40:21,195 --> 01:40:22,719
Go on, tell me...

1092
01:40:22,797 --> 01:40:25,857
you pig fucker.

1093
01:40:25,933 --> 01:40:29,869
You goddamn fucking,
pig-fucking liar.

1094
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,714
l`m sorry. l--

1095
01:40:44,518 --> 01:40:48,113
l just can`t--
l can`t stand it...

1096
01:40:48,189 --> 01:40:52,057
to see these goddamn things
on your face.

1097
01:40:59,767 --> 01:41:02,759
You never wore makeup,
all this fucking shit.

1098
01:41:02,837 --> 01:41:06,102
l`m gonna take this off your mouth.

1099
01:41:07,808 --> 01:41:09,241
Lipstick.

1100
01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:13,612
Oh, God.

1101
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:19,911
l`m sorry.

1102
01:41:21,255 --> 01:41:23,689
l don`t know why you did it.

1103
01:41:24,959 --> 01:41:27,393
l`d do it too,
if l knew how.

1104
01:41:28,829 --> 01:41:31,263
l just don`t know--

1105
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:41,337
l just have to find a way--

1106
01:41:42,410 --> 01:41:43,843
ls somebody there?

1107
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:47,640
What?

1108
01:41:47,715 --> 01:41:50,183
There is some noise there.

1109
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:55,555
All right, l`m-- l`m coming.

1110
01:42:00,661 --> 01:42:02,094
l have to go.

1111
01:42:04,165 --> 01:42:07,430
l have to go, sweetheart.
Somebody`s calling me.

1112
01:42:13,607 --> 01:42:15,541
Then is there somebody?

1113
01:42:15,609 --> 01:42:17,543
Yeah. l`m coming.

1114
01:42:22,283 --> 01:42:24,444
Hurry up!

1115
01:42:24,518 --> 01:42:26,179
Wake up!

1116
01:42:26,253 --> 01:42:27,743
Open up!

1117
01:42:27,822 --> 01:42:31,553
- But it`s 4:00 a.m.
- l need the usual room. Number 4.

1118
01:42:32,626 --> 01:42:34,389
Half an hour will do.

1119
01:42:34,462 --> 01:42:36,794
Yes, yes. Half an hour.

1120
01:42:36,864 --> 01:42:39,799
- We`re full.
- No, indeed.

1121
01:42:39,867 --> 01:42:43,769
When you`re full you put out a sign.
l know.

1122
01:42:44,839 --> 01:42:48,832
l`m tired of arguing.

1123
01:42:48,909 --> 01:42:50,274
Call the owner.

1124
01:42:50,344 --> 01:42:54,075
Move it! The owner`s
always been helpful to me.

1125
01:42:54,148 --> 01:42:57,743
We`re old friends, Rose and me.

1126
01:42:57,818 --> 01:42:59,752
Open, please.

1127
01:43:06,393 --> 01:43:09,328
Knock it off
if you don`t want me to tell her.

1128
01:43:09,396 --> 01:43:11,330
Come in. All set.

1129
01:43:15,536 --> 01:43:18,027
Happy? He left me.

1130
01:43:19,106 --> 01:43:20,835
Sorry.

1131
01:43:20,908 --> 01:43:23,843
Hurry, please.
He can`t be too far.

1132
01:43:26,547 --> 01:43:30,779
Talk him into coming back.
Tell him this can`t be done.

1133
01:44:15,262 --> 01:44:19,028
Please don`t say you found me.

1134
01:44:19,099 --> 01:44:21,124
Did you see how ugly she is?

1135
01:44:21,201 --> 01:44:23,465
Once my wife
was enough for me, but now...

1136
01:44:23,537 --> 01:44:26,165
she`s got a disease
that gives her snake skin.

1137
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:29,471
- Put yourself in my place.
- Come. Come with me.

1138
01:44:29,543 --> 01:44:31,977
Let me go.
Please let me go.

1139
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:39,444
You`re crazy! Let me go!

1140
01:44:41,889 --> 01:44:45,325
Get up, you faggot!
Get the fuck out of here!

1141
01:44:47,027 --> 01:44:48,460
Faggot!

1142
01:46:21,321 --> 01:46:26,782
Don`t you remember the gentlemen in 4?
He`s been living here for a few days.

1143
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:29,021
l don`t know anyone.

1144
01:46:29,096 --> 01:46:30,859
They come in, go out.

1145
01:46:30,931 --> 01:46:34,196
The man in 4. The lady in 1 .
What do l know?

1146
01:46:37,971 --> 01:46:40,906
Where`d they take the furniture?
lt`s empty.

1147
01:46:41,875 --> 01:46:44,537
Where do you send his mail?
Give me the address.

1148
01:46:44,611 --> 01:46:46,044
l don`t have it.

1149
01:46:48,749 --> 01:46:50,546
l don`t know anyone.

1150
01:46:51,585 --> 01:46:54,019
- Not even his name?
- Nothing.

1151
01:46:56,690 --> 01:46:57,782
Miss!

1152
01:47:08,569 --> 01:47:10,730
l found an apartment for us.

1153
01:47:12,039 --> 01:47:13,472
1 Jules Verne Street.

1154
01:47:15,409 --> 01:47:17,502
Yes, in Passy.

1155
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:22,510
Come quick.
Come right away.

1156
01:47:23,751 --> 01:47:25,685
You understood where it is?

1157
01:47:26,754 --> 01:47:28,688
l`ll wait for you.
Come.

1158
01:47:51,812 --> 01:47:53,245
Come in.

1159
01:47:55,983 --> 01:47:58,383
You like our apartment?

1160
01:47:58,452 --> 01:48:00,511
lt`s full of light.

1161
01:48:00,587 --> 01:48:04,523
There`s one room too small
for a big bed.

1162
01:48:04,591 --> 01:48:06,525
Maybe for a baby.

1163
01:48:06,593 --> 01:48:09,926
Fidel.
Nice name for a kid.

1164
01:48:09,997 --> 01:48:11,521
Fidel. Like Castro.

1165
01:48:11,598 --> 01:48:14,761
But l want a daughter too.
Rose.

1166
01:48:14,835 --> 01:48:19,534
Like Rose Luxembourg. She`s not
as well known, but she`s not bad.

1167
01:48:22,209 --> 01:48:25,144
l wanted to film you
every day.

1168
01:48:25,212 --> 01:48:30,275
ln the morning when you wake up,
then when you fall asleep.

1169
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:32,545
When you smile the first time.

1170
01:48:34,354 --> 01:48:36,379
And l didn`t film anything.

1171
01:48:42,896 --> 01:48:45,524
Today we finish shooting.

1172
01:48:45,599 --> 01:48:47,533
The film is finished.

1173
01:48:47,601 --> 01:48:50,593
l don`t like things that finish.

1174
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:53,606
One must begin something else
right away.

1175
01:48:58,979 --> 01:49:00,537
But it`s huge!

1176
01:49:01,415 --> 01:49:03,440
Who are you?

1177
01:49:03,517 --> 01:49:06,748
- You could get lost in here.
- Oh, stop it.

1178
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:08,811
How`d you find it?

1179
01:49:08,889 --> 01:49:10,015
By chance.

1180
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:13,059
- We`ll change everything.
- Everything.

1181
01:49:13,126 --> 01:49:15,822
We`ll change chance to fate.

1182
01:49:15,896 --> 01:49:17,386
Come forward. Take off!

1183
01:49:18,465 --> 01:49:20,456
You`re in heaven!

1184
01:49:20,534 --> 01:49:23,025
Now dive!

1185
01:49:23,103 --> 01:49:25,628
Make three turns!
Descend!

1186
01:49:31,678 --> 01:49:33,612
What`s happening to me?
An air pocket.

1187
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:35,545
What`s happening to you?

1188
01:49:38,685 --> 01:49:40,619
Enough of these turbulent zones.

1189
01:49:41,822 --> 01:49:44,882
We can`t joke like this,
like children.

1190
01:49:48,829 --> 01:49:51,457
- We`re adults.
- Adults? That`s terrible.

1191
01:49:52,532 --> 01:49:54,466
Yes, it`s terrible.

1192
01:49:57,204 --> 01:50:00,935
- Then how must we act?
- l don`t know.

1193
01:50:01,008 --> 01:50:04,910
lnvent gestures, words.

1194
01:50:04,978 --> 01:50:06,912
For example...

1195
01:50:14,521 --> 01:50:16,113
One thing l do know.

1196
01:50:16,189 --> 01:50:20,785
Adults are serious, logical...

1197
01:50:20,861 --> 01:50:22,954
circumspect, hairy...

1198
01:50:25,098 --> 01:50:26,861
They face all problems.

1199
01:50:28,101 --> 01:50:31,195
Here, this apartment is not for us.

1200
01:50:31,271 --> 01:50:34,672
Absolutely not.

1201
01:50:34,741 --> 01:50:37,642
- Where are you going?
- To look for another.

1202
01:50:37,711 --> 01:50:39,804
Another like what?

1203
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,075
One you can live in.

1204
01:50:42,149 --> 01:50:44,083
But you can live here.

1205
01:50:44,151 --> 01:50:47,587
l find this sad.
lt smells.

1206
01:50:47,654 --> 01:50:49,918
- Come with me?
- No, no.

1207
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:54,359
l have to close the windows, give
back the keys, leave it all in order.

1208
01:50:58,832 --> 01:51:00,993
Okay. Okay.

1209
01:51:01,068 --> 01:51:02,660
Bye.

1210
01:52:08,668 --> 01:52:10,602
lt`s me again.

1211
01:52:11,738 --> 01:52:14,229
lt`s over. lt`s over.

1212
01:52:14,307 --> 01:52:16,434
lt`s over,
then it begins again.

1213
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:20,207
What begins again?
l don`t understand anything anymore.

1214
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,770
There`s nothing to understand.

1215
01:52:21,848 --> 01:52:23,281
We left the apartment...

1216
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:26,513
and now we begin again
with love and all the rest of it.

1217
01:52:26,586 --> 01:52:28,520
- The rest?
- Yeah, listen.

1218
01:52:29,589 --> 01:52:32,524
l`m 45. l`m a widower.

1219
01:52:32,592 --> 01:52:34,787
l`ve got a little hotel.

1220
01:52:34,861 --> 01:52:38,388
lt`s kind of a dump,
but it`s not completely a flophouse.

1221
01:52:39,766 --> 01:52:42,599
l used to live on my luck.
l got married.

1222
01:52:42,669 --> 01:52:45,069
My wife killed herself and--

1223
01:52:46,339 --> 01:52:49,536
But what the hell.
l`m no prize.

1224
01:52:49,609 --> 01:52:52,476
l picked up a nail in Cuba
in 1 948.

1225
01:52:52,546 --> 01:52:56,107
Now l got a prostate
like an ldaho potato.

1226
01:52:56,183 --> 01:53:00,119
But l`m still a good stick man,
even if l can`t have any kids.

1227
01:53:01,721 --> 01:53:04,656
Let`s see.
l don`t have any stomping grounds.

1228
01:53:04,724 --> 01:53:06,658
l don`t have any friends.

1229
01:53:08,662 --> 01:53:11,130
l suppose
if l hadn`t met you...

1230
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:14,759
l` d probably settle for
a hard chair and a hemorrhoid.

1231
01:53:14,835 --> 01:53:18,168
Anyway, to make a long, dull story
even duller...

1232
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:22,299
l come from a time when a guy like me
would drop into a joint like this...

1233
01:53:22,375 --> 01:53:25,344
and pick up
a young chick like you...

1234
01:53:25,412 --> 01:53:27,346
and call her a bimbo.

1235
01:53:35,055 --> 01:53:36,989
l`m awfully sorry to intrude...

1236
01:53:37,057 --> 01:53:39,992
but l was so struck
with your beauty...

1237
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:43,587
that l thought perhaps l could
offer you a glass of champagne.

1238
01:53:43,663 --> 01:53:46,029
ls this seat taken?

1239
01:53:46,099 --> 01:53:47,566
May l?

1240
01:53:47,634 --> 01:53:49,568
lf you`d like to.

1241
01:53:58,712 --> 01:54:01,647
You know,
the tango is a rite.

1242
01:54:03,316 --> 01:54:05,113
You understand ''rite''?

1243
01:54:05,185 --> 01:54:08,348
You must watch the legs
of the dancers.

1244
01:54:39,019 --> 01:54:42,455
You haven`t drunk your champagne.

1245
01:54:42,522 --> 01:54:46,686
And then l ordered you a Scotch,
and you haven`t drunk your Scotch.

1246
01:54:57,871 --> 01:54:59,361
Now, come on.

1247
01:54:59,439 --> 01:55:01,373
Just a sip for Daddy.

1248
01:55:04,611 --> 01:55:07,637
Now, if you love me
you`ll drink all of it.

1249
01:55:07,714 --> 01:55:10,148
Okay. l love you.

1250
01:55:10,217 --> 01:55:11,946
Bravo.

1251
01:55:12,018 --> 01:55:13,952
Tell me about your wife.

1252
01:55:21,595 --> 01:55:23,529
Let`s talk about us.

1253
01:55:24,965 --> 01:55:26,728
Okay.

1254
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,734
But this place is so pitiful.

1255
01:55:29,936 --> 01:55:32,370
Yes, but l`m here, aren`t l?

1256
01:55:33,673 --> 01:55:35,766
Mr. mâitre d`hôtel.

1257
01:55:36,843 --> 01:55:38,777
That`s rather nasty.

1258
01:55:39,879 --> 01:55:41,972
Anyway, you dummy, l love you...

1259
01:55:43,283 --> 01:55:45,547
and l want to live with you.

1260
01:55:45,619 --> 01:55:47,553
ln your flophouse?

1261
01:55:50,857 --> 01:55:54,224
ln my flophouse?
What the hell does that mean?

1262
01:55:54,294 --> 01:55:59,231
What the hell difference does it make if
l have a flophouse, a hotel or a castle?

1263
01:55:59,299 --> 01:56:01,767
l love you.
What the fuck difference does it make?

1264
01:56:25,158 --> 01:56:27,126
The jury has just chosen...

1265
01:56:27,193 --> 01:56:30,560
the following ten best couples.

1266
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:33,224
Three, seven...

1267
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:35,894

1268
01:56:35,969 --> 01:56:38,836

1269
01:56:38,905 --> 01:56:42,033
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

1270
01:56:42,108 --> 01:56:43,541
and nineteen.

1271
01:56:44,978 --> 01:56:47,037
Then, ladies and gentlemen...

1272
01:56:47,113 --> 01:56:49,411
all best wishes
for the last tango.

1273
01:57:04,197 --> 01:57:06,131
Give me some more whiskey.

1274
01:57:07,567 --> 01:57:09,501
l thought you weren`t drinking.

1275
01:57:09,569 --> 01:57:12,504
But l`m thirsty now,
and l want some more drink.

1276
01:57:12,572 --> 01:57:14,437
All right.

1277
01:57:14,507 --> 01:57:17,442
l think that`s a good idea--
Wait a minute.

1278
01:57:18,945 --> 01:57:21,505
Because you`re really beautiful--

1279
01:57:21,581 --> 01:57:23,208
Wait a minute.

1280
01:57:23,283 --> 01:57:24,716
l`m sorry.

1281
01:57:26,152 --> 01:57:30,088
l`m terribly sorry.
l didn`t mean to spill my drink.

1282
01:57:34,094 --> 01:57:36,255
Let`s have a toast...

1283
01:57:36,329 --> 01:57:38,297
to our life in the hotel.

1284
01:57:38,365 --> 01:57:40,799
No! Fuck all that.
Come on.

1285
01:57:40,867 --> 01:57:43,165
No. Hey, listen.

1286
01:57:43,236 --> 01:57:47,172
Let`s drink a toast
to our life in the country.

1287
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:50,209
You`re a nature lover?
You didn`t tell me that.

1288
01:57:50,276 --> 01:57:51,709
l`m Nature Boy.

1289
01:57:51,778 --> 01:57:55,339
Can`t you see me with the cows
and the chicken shit all over me?

1290
01:57:55,415 --> 01:57:56,848
Oh, yeah.

1291
01:57:56,916 --> 01:57:58,850
To the house of the cows.

1292
01:57:59,986 --> 01:58:01,920
l will be your cow too.

1293
01:58:04,324 --> 01:58:07,782
And listen,
l get to milk you twice a day.

1294
01:58:08,895 --> 01:58:11,955
- How about that?
- l hate the country.

1295
01:58:12,031 --> 01:58:15,364
- What do you mean?
- l hate it.

1296
01:58:15,435 --> 01:58:17,562
l prefer to go to the hotel.

1297
01:58:17,637 --> 01:58:19,832
Come on.
Let`s go to your hotel.

1298
01:58:19,906 --> 01:58:23,842
Listen, let`s dance.
How about that? Let`s dance.

1299
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:25,844
Don`t you want to dance?

1300
01:59:37,317 --> 01:59:39,376
Out! What are you doing?

1301
01:59:39,452 --> 01:59:42,979
lt`s love! Always--

1302
01:59:43,056 --> 01:59:46,116
But it`s a contest!
Where`s the love fit in?

1303
01:59:46,192 --> 01:59:48,387
Go to the movies to see love!

1304
01:59:52,765 --> 01:59:55,233
Oh, by God...

1305
01:59:55,301 --> 01:59:58,532
this is the end
of our love affair, darling.

1306
01:59:58,605 --> 02:00:00,573
Kiss this!

1307
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:04,076
Farewell forever.
Farewell, you sweet peach blossom.

1308
02:00:04,143 --> 02:00:06,907
Oh, my mother`s eyes!
Good-bye!

1310
02:00:11,050 --> 02:00:12,483
Oh, my hemorrhoid.

1311
02:00:17,557 --> 02:00:19,821
Beauty of mine, sit before me.

1312
02:00:19,893 --> 02:00:24,330
Let me peruse you
and remember you always like this.

1313
02:00:32,305 --> 02:00:36,264
''lf music be the food of love,
play on.''

1314
02:00:36,342 --> 02:00:38,503
What`s the matter with you?

1315
02:00:38,578 --> 02:00:40,307

1316
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:42,905

02:00:46,519 --> 02:00:49,386
We`re never going to
see each other again. Never.

1320
02:00:49,455 --> 02:00:51,389
That`s ridiculous.

1321
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,394
lt`s not a joke.

1322
02:00:56,462 --> 02:00:57,895
Ooh, you dirty rat.

1323
02:00:57,964 --> 02:00:59,898
lt`s finished.

1324
02:00:59,966 --> 02:01:03,561
Look, when something`s finished,
it begins again. Don`t you see?

Well...Jesus.

Besides,

if l never see you again.

1351
02:03:58,444 --> 02:03:59,877

Over easy
or sunny side up?

02:06:20,419 --> 02:06:22,853
You ran through Africa and Asia...
