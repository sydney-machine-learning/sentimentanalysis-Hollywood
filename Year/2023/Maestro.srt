00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,791
- It's amazing, I remember all this.
- I know.

172
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:09,958
I don't know how.

173
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,666
You moved to Chile
because of your father's business.

174
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,958
And now you're firmly planted
in New York City studying...

175
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,083
piano, but you're
actually studying acting.

176
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,666
A career which demands the versatility
to play a panoply of characters.

177
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,375
And that is my conclusion,

178
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,375
that you, my dear, are very similar to me.

179
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,458
- How?
- Because you had to take

180
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,708
all the pieces, all the bits of you
scattered across these varied landscapes

181
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,750
and form, create the veritable person
that stands before me now.

182
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,041
How is that similar?

183
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,541
- You just asked me and I told you.
- I know. Okay.

184
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,041
Russian Orthodox Jew.

185
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,458
- Growing up in Boston.
- Oh, someone else was listening.

186
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,875
- Child of immigrants.
- Yes.

187
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,875
Your father's a self-made businessman.

188
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,000
Steeped in Talmud.
Harvard.

189
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,916
- Then Curtis School for Music...
- Institute.

190
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,750
Institute of Music in Philadelphia.

191
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,875
Now firmly planted here in New York City
pursuing composition and conducting.

192
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,500
Under the guise of a concert pianist
drawn to this artistic Mecca,

193
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,875
fleeing my puritanical origins
just like you.

194
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,333
Surely your family was
a tad more supportive.

195
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:10,083
My father imagined me a klezmer,
playing for kopecks on the street corner,

196
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,916
desperate for me to join
the family business to make a living.

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,458
What was the family business?

198
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,875
- Samuel J. Bernstein Hair Company.
- [laughing]

199
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:18,833
- Really?
- Yes.

200
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,250
So I had no choice
but to become a composite of

201
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,458
adopted speech,
manner and outlook on life,

202
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,500
a composite, which enables me to be
many things at once.

203
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,583
And that's why, we, you and I,
are able to endure and survive

204
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,583
'cause the world wants us to be
only one thing and I find that deplorable.

205
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,500
I find you very attractive, Felicia.

206
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,791
<i>♪ Carried away, carried away ♪</i>

207
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,083
<i>♪ You got carried away ♪</i>

208
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,375
It's really too much. I'm very sorry.

209
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,250
Wait! Wait!

210
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,392
["Trouble in Tahiti" playing]

211
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,958
Go! Go! Go!

212
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,250
Oh, I like that.

213
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,041
You've a lot of energy,
have to tell you.

214
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,291
I'm just following you.
I don't know where.

215
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,916
I've never been in this part of town.

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,375
I can't imagine you
being in a place like this.

217
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,333
- Now, you go in here.
- Okay.

218
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,125
- Just on the stage... Take your shoes off.
- Oh.

219
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,708
Okay. Where do I put them?

220
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,208
Over on the other side.

221
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,041
- Where are you going?
- I'm just getting the script.

222
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,958
- The script?
- Yes.

223
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,333
- Would I have to act too?
- What?

224
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,625
- Do I have to do something?
- Well... maybe.

225
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,666
Now I'm nervous.

226
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,166
You should be nervous.

227
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,750
Well, this is just lovely.

228
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,875
This is just lovely.

229
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,291
I'm going to read a scene
with Maestro Bernstein.

230
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,041
I better make a show of myself.

231
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,458
Maestro Bernstein?
That sounds very fancy.

232
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,333
- Here.
- Okay. We're gonna read it.

233
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,083
- We're actually gonna do it.
- Yes.

234
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,476
- I'm the king?
- You're the king, and this is your castle.

235
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,541
Oh, wonderful.

236
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,958
Now, even though you are the king,

237
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,916
- you're quite taken with me.
- Yes.

238
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,166
So, you decided to give me a white rose
from your crown.

239
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,250
Of course I did.

240
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,541
No, you don't have it yet.
I have to give it to you.

241
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,750
- Here's your flower.
- I didn't read the play.

242
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,708
- I know.
- Hold on.

243
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,958
Can you hold this for me, please?
All right.

244
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,666
Since I'm the king...

245
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,000
who's in love.

246
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,750
A gift for me, my liege?

247
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,375
Oh, that's very good.

248
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,625
- It's your line.
- Oh, uh...

249
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,583
"With your little spots of wax,
white rose,

250
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,291
you look like the extravagantly hands
her the flower..."

251
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,958
No, no, no. [chuckles]

252
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,791
"You look like the eye...

253
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,500
of a broken moon."

254
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,000
[chuckles] You are terrible.

255
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,291
What's your line?

256
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,458
"You're always changing, my love."

257
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,916
"I didn't see you yesterday."

258
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,833
"But I looked at your horse."

259
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,541
"It's so beautiful."

260
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,166
"But not as beautiful as you are...

261
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,416
because you are a dragon."

262
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,375
"I believe you could
break me in two with your arms,

263
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,208
as weak as I am...

264
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,958
like frost

265
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,500
burned in the sun."

[switch clicks]

267
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,625
[Joseph] That's a bit better,
isn't it, Ms. Montealegre?

268
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,333
Little more light?

269
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,416
- Why, thank you, Joseph.
- Oh, Joseph, I apologize.

270
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:06,208
I got nervous. I thought it was a spider
and I tried to kill it with my jacket.

271
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,416
Give the stage door a shove
on your way out. It'll lock on its own.

272
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,625
[Leonard] Thank you, Joseph.

273
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,833
[Felicia] Good night. Marvelous.
Thank you, Joseph.

274
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,333
You didn't tell me
your father owns this place.

275
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,416
[Felicia laughs]

276
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,625
Is this how you lure in
all your male suitors?

277
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,666
No, I... I rarely stay up past 9:00.

278
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,083
Hold on a sec.
You made an exception for me?

279
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,875
I thought maybe you were worth
making an exception for.

280
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,791
Oh, well,
I hope it doesn't cost you too much.

281
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,083
How can I make it worth your while?
Oh, I've got it.

282
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,375
- Something's wrong.
- What?

283
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,166
- What's your character's name?
- Um...

284
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,666
- Margaret.
- Margaret.

285
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,833
[both laugh]

286
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,125
- Margaret.
- Yes.

287
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,416
- And you're the understudy?
- Yes.

288
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,083
I think you should be Margaret
eight shows a week.

289
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,166
Front and center.

290
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,541
- If it's fear that's stopping you...
- There are many things stopping me

291
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,041
but fear isn't one of them.

292
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,125
I wouldn't be standing here
in front of you...

293
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,916
I wouldn't even be in New York City
if fear got the better of me.

294
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,083
It's just not that easy.

295
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,750
We'd be fools not to think that

296
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,500
luck plays a part
as well as talent and determination.

297
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,500
- I'm a perfect example of that.
- Oh, you must be joking.

298
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,125
If Bruno Walter hadn't
gotten sick that fateful day

299
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,333
and Rodziński snowed in upstate,
I never would've had my debut.

300
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,791
I'd be teaching piano
to little eight-year-olds who complain...

301
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,250
If it wasn't that day,
it would've been another.

302
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,500
- Is that what you think?
- Yes, I know it.

303
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,041
- Really?
- Of course.

304
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,291
And don't forget... you are a man.

305
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,083
I never do.

306
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:47,958
Right.

307
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,375
Oh, my God.

308
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,375
- ["Paris Waltz (Candide)" playing]
- [audience applauding]

309
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,166
Bravo!

310
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,125
You were marvelous.

311
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,875
Oh, my goodness.
Shirley, it was very kind of you to come.

312
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,583
- I brought Richard Hart and his wife, Lil.
- No.

313
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,791
Dick is rehearsing
his new Broadway show with Eva Gabor

314
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:55,416
and he is not long for this marriage
and, well, I think he is your type.

315
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,166
- What type is that?
- Same as mine,

316
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,666
unavailable.

317
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,666
Marvelous.

318
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,708
[Felicia] Ah, ah...

319
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,375
It's so kind of you to come.

320
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,458
I just love <i>Dark of the Moon.</i>

321
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,916
Oh, stop. You're marvelous.

322
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,208
The production is better
for you being in it.

323
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,958
It's only for the week,
but that's kind of you to say.

324
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,041
If they had any sense,
they'll tell Ms. Jones to stay in bed.

325
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,541
You really are wonderful.

326
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,541
- Dear.
- Thank you, it's so kind of you to come.

327
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,833
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

328
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,333
- Come have a bite with us.
- Oh, I, uh...

329
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,416
I can't, I'm catching the train
to Tanglewood in the morning.

330
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,583
- Tanglewood?
- Mmm.

331
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,958
You're going to see my brother.

332
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,541
- Well, don't look so surprised.
- I'm not... I just...

333
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,833
He didn't mention it.

334
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,250
Well...

335
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,791
- Perhaps he was being discreet?
- My brother?

336
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,125
I doubt it.

337
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,875
- [Felicia] No, try again.
- Oh, gee, it's six.

338
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,166
- [Felicia] No!
- Eight.

339
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,541
- Terrible.
- It's four...

340
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,625
- No.
- Three.

341
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,583
Well, it has to be seven then.

342
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,291
Can you try to just concentrate?

343
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,458
Maybe I should stop
and think for a second.

344
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,291
You just stop and think
'cause I am sending it to you

345
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,125
right now.

346
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,833
- Twenty.
- No.

348
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,375
No.

349
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,875
So, how long do we have to do this for?

350
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,791
Well, we need to build up
a very strong connection.

351
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,375
- I can't. I don't know what you're doing.
- Hmm?

352
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,541
You could be building
a bomb back there for all I know.

353
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,666
No.

354
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:36,250
- I'm just very terribly relaxed.
- Blow the whole place up.

355
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,333
Aren't you?

356
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,708
- Yes, I am.
- Are you?

357
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,625
Yes.

358
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,208
I've never seen you sit still for so long.

359
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,083
- Are you itching to move?
- No, I'm not.

360
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,333
- Good.
- Actually, at all.

361
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,791
["Facsimile" by Leonard Bernstein playing]

362
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,125
Come here, I'll do it.

363
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,875
My goodness.

364
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,125
- I'm useless, aren't I?
- You are.

365
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,083
Where am I going?

366
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,583
- Here, stand there. Not this one.
- Okay.

367
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,875
- Not.
- Oh, why not?

368
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,708
Well... a bit garish maybe?

369
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,791
Doesn't look bumbling so much.

370
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:19,875
I like this.

371
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,833
I love your smell.

372
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,125
- You do?
- I do.

373
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,916
It's my father.

374
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,125
Isn't that odd?

375
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,666
I used to just love...

376
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,458
wrapping myself up

377
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,875
in his trench coat,

378
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,500
when he would walk in the door
at night from work...

379
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,833
That smell would intoxicate me.

380
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:04,125
I always associated it with feeling safe.

381
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,958
[Kouss] She's so beautiful.
Tell me about her.

382
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,291
- She's wonderful. She's a lovely girl.
- Yes.

383
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,291
- And we're just...
- Where did you meet?

384
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,916
- We met at a party at Claudio Arrau's.
- Ah.

385
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,625
So, Felicia, are you an actress?

386
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,548
- [Leonard] Marvelous actress, yes.
- No, I am.

387
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,375
- [Leonard] Of course you are.
- No, I am.

388
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,750
Unbelievably, I am.

389
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,500
- He is not.
- No, horrible.

390
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,416
- No, I am.
- Screen tested once in LA

391
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,375
- and it was horrible.
- Terrible actor.

392
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,708
They sent me to Hollywood
and put me on camera

393
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:36,208
and said, "Thank you, here's a one-way
ticket back to New York City."

394
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,708
- [Felicia] Oh, no.
- "Oh, no" is right.

395
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:43,416
He was a student here
at our inaugural summer and now...

396
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,291
he's everyone's favorite teacher

397
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:50,541
and you can't even get into the shed
when he's conducting the student orchestra

398
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,250
because it's so full.

399
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:55,291
- It's only because I love them so much.
- [Aaron] And they love you.

400
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,875
[Kouss] Tell me what happened
with the Rochester Philharmonic.

401
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:02,166
- Oh, they passed me over.
- [Kouss] Yes, I know.

402
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,875
They thought I was spending
too much time with you in Boston.

403
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:10,000
- Is that the reason?
- I believe it was.

404
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,833
[Aaron] We should really discuss
"Our Town" if you have...

405
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,583
[Kouss] Running off to Hollywood?

406
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,333
- Wasting time on musical theater...
- I promise,

407
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,958
I'm giving up musical theater.

408
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:24,041
Lenny, you are responsible
on account of your gifts.

409
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:29,916
He can be
the first great American conductor.

410
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,833
[Olga and Kouss speaking Russian]

411
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:37,125
[in English]
But he would have to conduct his life

412
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:42,041
in such a way that when he comes out
on stage to lead his orchestra,

413
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:48,333
he can truthfully say to himself,
"My life and my work are clean."

414

[Olga and Kouss speaking Russian]

415
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,833
[in English] And the name...

416
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:57,166
To a Bernstein,
they will never give an orchestra.

417
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,041
But a Burns?

418
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:05,958
Leonard S. Burns.

419
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:12,166
- I'd have to sleep on that.
- I used to entertain people

420
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,333
on the train
going back and forth to Moscow.

421
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:19,750
And upon every arrival,
I had to return straightaway

422
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:23,666
because, of course,
as Jews, we weren't allowed to live there.

423
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:26,708
I never saw the city.

424
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:28,833
Not once.

425
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:32,125

427
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,166

- Yes.

Why would you ever want to give this up?

436
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,958
- It's so wonderful.
- It's not serious music, is it?

437
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,625
Well, what does that mean?

438
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,375
Well, it means...

440
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,708

[Felicia] Mmm.

...I used to have dreams
where I would kill my father.

488
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:10,208
And the thing of it is, I would wake up
from the dream and I'd sit in bed...

489
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,833
and I would just fantasize about it...

- Does it?

500

Out of my mouth, I hope.

- No.

00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,416
You don't even know
how much you need me, do you?

510
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,000
I might.

511
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,833
Sweetie, that was
better than Philadelphia.

512
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,791
- Really?
- It took everything from me

513
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,625
- not to leap right into the orchestra.
- You're too kind.

514
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:20,375
Did I tell you about the girl?
The girl that I wrote letters... Felicia.

515
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,875
- The one I wrote about.
- Yes, yes.

516
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,750
This is David and he plays the clarinet.
What else does he...

517
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,833
- I play the clarinet.
- [Felicia] I can see.

518
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,958
- And he's extraordinary.
- Yes.

519
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:39,125
Oh, well, I was listening,
you were wonderful.

520
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,458
You as well. Broadway star.

521
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:43,000
Oh, no.

522
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,958
[Leonard] We're gonna have lunch
with Kouss, otherwise we'd...

523
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,250
What about later?
Have a drink or something?

524
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,333
I would love that, yeah.

525
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,208
- I didn't mean to spring that on you.
- No, that's all right.

526
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:00,125
- Maybe that was insensitive of me.
- No.

527
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:01,958
Not at all.

528
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,458
- So, we'll see you later on.
- Yes.

529
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,541
Okay, let's go. Come on.
Come on, little birdy!

530
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,666
- Lovely to meet you.
- [Felicia] Lovely to meet you.

531
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:20,208
["For Felicia Montealegre"
by Leonard Bernstein playing]

532
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:33,583
Oh, life is not that serious.
Honest, it isn't.

533
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:36,583
What age are we living in?
One can be as free as one likes

534
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:39,375
without guilt or confession.
Please, what's the harm?

535
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,291
I know exactly who you are.

536
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:44,916
Let's...

537
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,000
give it a whirl.

538
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,458
- Yes.
- Yes?

539
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,958
- I mean...
- No!

540
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,666
- Not here.
- No, not here.

541
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,750
No, it's not how I meant it to be.

542
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:18,333
[Edward] Leonard Bernstein is
a composer, conductor and pianist.

543
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,791
His wife, Felicia Montealegre,
is an actress.

544
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:25,625
Both lead full, professional lives,
but they're seldom apart.

545
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:28,125
Mr. Bernstein is 37 years old

546
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,916
but he has been in the public eye
for a dozen years.

547
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,500
From the time
he substituted for Bruno Walter

548
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:36,250
to conduct the Philharmonic Symphony
at the age of 25,

549
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:40,458
since then, Leonard Bernstein has
conducted or played all over the world.

550
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:43,333
And he's written
symphonies, ballets, and opera,

551
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:46,500
as well as scores
for the Broadway musical <i>Wonderful Town</i>

552
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,666
and the motion picture <i>On the Waterfront.</i>

553
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,458
Felicia Montealegre came to Broadway
and American television

554
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,208
from Santiago, Chile.

555
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:57,708
She was one of television's first
full-fledged dramatic stars.

556
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:02,291
The Bernsteins, Leonard, Felicia
and their children,

557
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,750
Jamie and two-months-old Alexander,

558
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:07,666
live in New York City
near Carnegie Hall and Broadway.

559
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:10,291
They've been here for about three years.

560
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,791
Good evening, Felicia.

561
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,500
- Hello, Ed.
- Good evening, Lenny.

562
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,958
- How are you, Ed?
- Good.

563
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,416
Lenny, it's always, for me,

564
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,833
rather difficult
to classify you professionally

565
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,125
since you do so many things
at the same time.

566
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,416
What do you consider
your primary occupation?

567
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,625
I guess I'd have to say that
my primary occupation is musician.

568
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,041
Anything that has to
do with music is my province,

569
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,583
wouldn't you say?
Whether it's composing it

570
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:36,833
or conducting it, or teaching it,
or studying it, or playing it.

571
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:39,125
As long as it's music,
I like it and I do it.

572
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:42,088
[Edward] Felicia, do you have trouble
keeping up with Lenny's activities?

573
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,000
It gets pretty hard.
He's taken on many activities.

574
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,291
This season promises to be
a very hectic one.

575
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,708
Among them,
he's writing two musical shows.

576
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:51,750
One of them is an adaptation,

577
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,250
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>
that's <i>West Side Story</i>

578
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,458
with Jerry Robbins and Arthur Laurents

579
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,416
and wonderfully-talented young lyricist
Stevie Sondheim.

580
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,500
And then he's doing
four feature presentations

581
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:05,500
in <i>Omnibus,</i>
the CBS television program.

582
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,583
And, um...

583
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,916
- Was that right?
- You know my schedule better than I do.

584
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,750
[Edward] Felicia, what about you?

585
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,250
Are you engaged in other things
besides acting?

586
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:20,625
Well, it gets pretty hard to do much more
than take care of this household.

587
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:26,541
My husband, the children, and acting takes
the rest of the time that's left over.

588
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,333
- And memorizing my projects.
- Well...

589
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:30,833
I can't help that.

590
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:33,083
Lenny, what's the big difference
in the life

591
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:35,791
of Composer Bernstein
and Conductor Bernstein?

592
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:37,666
Well, I sup...

593
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,583
I suppose it's a difference. It's...

594
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:44,208
a personality difference
which occurs between any composer

595
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:47,375
versus any...
or any creator versus any performer.

596
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,500
Any performer, whether it's

597
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:53,250
Toscanini or Tallulah Bankhead,
whoever it is,

598
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,958
leads a kind of public life.

599
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,583
An extrovert life, if you will.

600
00:38:57,666 --> 00:39:00,291
It's an oversimplified word,
but something like that.

601
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:03,666
Whereas a creative person, uh,

602
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,083
sits alone in this great studio
that you see here

603
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,000
and writes all by himself and...

604
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,958
communicates with the world
in a very private way and...

605
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,125
and lives a rather...

606
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:20,500
grand inner life
rather than a grand outer life.

607
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,291
And if you carry around
both personalities...

608
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,125
I suppose that means you become
a schizophrenic and that's the end of it.

609
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,041
[Edward] Felicia, you must be
interested in music too, aren't you?

610
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,666
["To What You Said"
by Leonard Bernstein playing]

611
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,958
[Jamie] Daddy.

612
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,208
Daddy!

613
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,291
Catch!

614
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,208
{\an8}[Leonard chuckles]

615
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,916
Well, I love you too, darling.

616
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,583
So much. Thank you.

617
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,416
Well, hello, children of Zeus!

618
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
My man!

619
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,208
- Hello, Lenny.
- Hello.

620
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,250
What a lovely surprise.

621
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,958
That's why I love New York City.

622
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,375
Come out of your apartment

623
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:27,291
and all of sudden
you just run into people that you love.

624
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,708
- I'm going downtown. Oh.
- [David] So am I.

625
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,875
[Ellen] Well, we're cutting
across the park to go to Saks

626
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:36,583
- before the deluge.
- Who are you? Hello. Hello.

627
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:40,083
Hello, you're so beautiful.
You're so precious.

628
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,583
Can I tell you a secret?

629
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,458
Do you know
I slept with both your parents?

630
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,041
Too much, isn't it? Too much.

631
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,833
I love too much, what can I say?
But I'm reining it in.

632
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:51,208
I'm reining it in!

633
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,166
See those people across the avenue
staring at us?

634
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,625
Saying, "It can't be him.
He's much better-looking on television."

635
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,833
"Certainly has Leonard Bernstein's ears
though, doesn't he?"

636
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,666
"Can that be him? Is that possible?"

637
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:10,166
How embarrassing.
We don't even have silverware.

638
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,250
- Here.
- Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

639
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:14,958
What's wrong with the silverware?
We don't need it.

640
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,250
I ordered the Chinese food, remember?

641
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,125
The problem is we need those
fucking curtains so I can sleep.

642
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,041
Walk around like a zombie.

643
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,125
Scare all our children.

644
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,958
- Do we have children in this house?
- We do.

645
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,458
I don't know how the Bergs do it.
Three children.

646
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:32,791
Three! I know, it's unbelievable.
Unreasonable.

647
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,833
Alex doesn't make any noise.
I think we'll be fine.

648
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:37,541
- No, for now.
- Sleeps all day.

649
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:40,791
- Alexander, our sleeping little baby.
- He won't sleep for long.

650
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:43,291
- It's like he isn't even real.
- No.

651
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,208
Dream baby.

652
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,083
I'm sad, darling,
and I don't know why.

653
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:57,125
Darling, you're so tired.
You just need to sleep.

654
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,666
Yes.

655
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:05,166
Summer sang in me a little while,
it sings in me no more.

656
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,583
Edna St. Vincent Millay.

657
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,750
If the summer doesn't sing in you,

658
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,833
then nothing sings in you.

659
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:19,250
And if nothing sings in you,

660
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,083
then you can't make music.

661
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:32,583
There's a price for being
in my brother's orbit, you know that.

662
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:35,500
As much as he'd love to believe
the opposite is true.

663
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,916
[Felicia] I suppose
I do understand what you mean.

664
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,458
Well, it's very strange, but I...

665
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:43,166
I do believe
there is that in everybody.

666
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,875
One wishes to make adjustments to oneself.

667
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,083
[Leonard] This way.

668
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But...

669
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,208
having this imposition
of a strong personality,

670
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:57,708
it's like a way of death.

671
00:43:58,541 --> 00:43:59,541
Really.

672
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:02,541
Yet the moment I see that
that is making him suffer,

673
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,791
well, I realize it's not worth it.

674
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:07,458
No. What for? It isn't going to kill me.

675
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:10,666
If it was going to give him pleasure
or stop him from suffering

676
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,250
and it's in my power to do it
then what the hell?

677
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:16,958
But one has to do it
completely without sacrifice.

678
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:21,708
And if there's going to be a sacrifice,
then I disappear.

679
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:24,625
Good?

680
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,458
Oh! [laughs]

681
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:34,500
That time, that time really was good!

683
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:06,625
["Adagietto" by Gustav Mahler playing]

684
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,333
[music crescendos]

685
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,041
[audience applauding]

686
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,458
[music fades]

687
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,333
- [Mendy] Wicker!
- Oh, my God!

688
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:55,291
[Mendy] White antique wicker
with Pierre Deux cushions.

689
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,916
- [Felicia] I love it.
- It will give it that

690
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,750
whimsical, Victorian conservatory look.

691
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,916
[Felicia] So you want to lock me up in a
glass cage like some sort of exotic bird.

692
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,208
I'm surrounded by men
and it feels so right.

693
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:11,875
They are really better.

694
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:15,791
I think Felicia is... I don't know...
I just can't make heads or tails of her.

695
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,666
She's fine. She's just, you know, I mean...

696
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,666
Are you all right? Do you need
to get a towel or something?

697
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,666
Julia! Julia! Julia!

698
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,958
I think we need a towel.

699
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:28,458
It's that you're so distracted
all the time.

700
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,375
I'm going to go take a big dump.

701
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:32,125
Okay, wonderful.

702
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:35,541
- Oh, my God.
- Has Daddy mentioned anything about

703
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:38,541
- Harry and Amberson this summer?
- No.

704
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:41,708
Oh, Harry's offering me a job
at Amberson this summer.

705
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:42,791
What do you think?

706
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:46,666
- What does Daddy say?
- Daddy thinks it's a great idea.

707
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,958
Then I think it's great.

708
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,583
- So I have your blessing?
- Yes.

709
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:51,500
- Thank you. Bye.
- I love you. Bye.

710
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,083
- [Cynthia] She looks so grown up.
- [Felicia] Looks can be deceiving.

711
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,583
- I got the go ahead.
- [chuckles]

712
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:59,083
Thank you so much.

713
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:01,916
Be really good at this. Be really good.

714
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,625
- So happy.
- You're intimidating me. I'll try my best.

715
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,916
I just got trampled on in my own house.

716
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Come here.
I want you to meet a few people.

717
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:11,000
This guy almost trampled all over me.

718
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:13,083
- I was decapitated...
- Listen to me...

719
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,833
- I know, I'm tired, please...
- This is Lenny.

720
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:18,333
- Hello! How are you?
- This is Charlie.

721
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:20,208
All my hands are taken.

722
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,333
- You're a big fellow. Grand man.
- Jim.

723
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,291
You're a huge fellow. Hello, Charlie.

724
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,666
Pleasure. How are you? Having a good time?

725
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,666
Lenny should be composing.

726
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,750
- [Cynthia] Well...
- No, Harry loves to play it

727
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,958
on the side of him with the appearances
and the recordings and...

728
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,375
cookie-cutter boys.

729
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:38,101
- You know, he's not my favorite.
- My favorite.

730
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:40,125
No, I know, he's not my favorite.

731
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,916
- Well...
- Well...

732
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
- You're taking it like a champ.
- You are.

733
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:46,291
- I would never know.
- Handling it quite well.

734
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:47,833
- Our little Joan of Arc.
- Yes.

735
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:50,875
But remember what happened to Joan.
Didn't work out so well.

736
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:52,166
[Scott] So bored.

737
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:57,291
- Hello, Scott.
- Hello.

738
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:01,791
We don't say that in our family.
Felicia doesn't like it.

739
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,083
- In your family?
- In my family.

740
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,375
Your family, Lenny?

741
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:07,000
[laughing]

742
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,875
[Harry] Okay, that's enough.

743
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:16,083
- We've been together for ten years.
- Believe me, I know three of them.

744
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,500
I guess denial is
not just a river in Egypt.

745
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:21,416
- That was the crossword. Three letters.
- Really?

746
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:23,083
Pun.

747
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,833
- Yes, it is "pun".
- Yes, it is.

748
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:26,416
- Did you do it Thursday?
- Yes.

749
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,000
- It's quite easy, but...
- Yeah.

750
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,416
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Tommy.

751
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,250
Did you just appear
out of my handkerchief?

752
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,041
- I live here now.
- Are you a genie?

753
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:36,708
- I wish.
- Do I get three wishes?

754
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:39,000
- What's your first wish? Hi.
- My first wish.

755
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,708
Good luck. Bye, Tommy.

756
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,666
Sorry, I don't even know if you...

757
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,250
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

758
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,293
- Felicia puts it together.
- She does a good job.

759
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,875
If I was left to my devices,
I'd be dressed like a clown.

760
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,833
That's the truth. Don't tell anybody.

761
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:57,166
Mind if I smoke in the other room?
Where do you live? Who are you?

762
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,291
- I'm from San Francisco.
- So you're from Earth?

763
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:00,958
Originally, yes.

764
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,250
- Your hair is glorious.
- That's sweet of you.

765
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,791
Listen, I have to go to the roof.
I need some air.

766
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:08,125
- Would you mind to come with me?
- I'd love to.

767
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:10,458
That's wonderful. Come here.
Tommy, is it?

768
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:12,181
- Toast of the party.
- Belle of the ball.

769
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,541
The belle of the ball!

770
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:16,666
- My God, are you kidding me?
- Both at the same time. Somehow.

771
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,083
A highwire act. Toast bell. Toast bell.

772
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,625
Have you seen Lenny anywhere?

773
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,208
Do you want me to fetch him?

774
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,125
No, I don't mind.

775
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:33,291
That's what I'm saying,
that I needed the turtleneck.

776
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:35,875
I needed the turtleneck,
you know what I'm saying?

777
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:38,083
I mean, that's the...
As I break this fucking wall.

778
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,791
- How will we solve this problem?
- I don't know what to do.

779
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:44,500
I'm worried about it.
We have to figure it out.

780
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:47,333
Well, don't they...
Do your listeners know what you look like?

781
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:49,833
The problem is you're in radio,
you need to be in television.

782
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:52,541
- Stop.
- You're gorgeous. May I?

783
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,208
Darling, this is Tommy.

784
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,666
- Everything okay?
- It's okay.

785
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,916
Darling.

786
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:07,791
Why don't you go through here? It's fine.

787
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,041
- Darling.
- No.

788
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,375
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

789
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:15,291
Fix your hair. You're getting sloppy.

790
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:39,916
Well, like it or not,
this world is utterly fascinated,

791
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,166
obsessed even, with everything about you.

792
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:48,000
Ever since that famous phone call
which led to your debut at Carnegie Hall.

793
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,083
And you have not let them down, my dear.

794
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:55,166
Fifteen years on television, teaching us
all the magic of classical music,

795
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:58,125
the <i>Young People's Concerts</i> and <i>Omnibus</i>

796
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,625
reaching hundreds of millions
all over the world,

797
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,625
ten years at the New York Philharmonic

798
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:04,625
and then there are the compositions.

799
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:08,541
<i>West Side Story</i> redefined
the American musical.

800
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:11,250
- Jesus Christ.
- Then there's <i>Candide</i> and <i>On the Town.</i>

801
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:14,541
Actually, when you add it up,
there's not much that I've created.

802
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:18,000
Music is... I don't...

803
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:22,958
I know this is gonna sound strange,
it was the most important thing I could do

804
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,875
and a great source
of dissatisfaction that I haven't

805
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,458
created that much at all.

806
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:32,375
I mean, when you add it up,
it's not a very long list.

807
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:33,958
Well...

808
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:35,875
What this is...

809
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:40,500
This is an opportunity for the world
to get to know you apart from all that.

810
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,958
This book is to understand what
you think about in your private moments.

811
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:49,666
Your personal feelings on,
well, on life as you know it.

812
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,416
I feel like the world is
on the verge of collapse.

813
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,708
That's what I feel like.

814
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,791
[John laughs]

815
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,583
I'm quite serious.

816
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,291
- Yes.
- The diminution of creativity,

817
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:05,083
which has come to a grinding halt.

818
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:10,125
I mean, not scientifically.
That has exploded.

819
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:14,416
But as we sit here,
I find it very difficult to...

820
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:17,791
think that...

821
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,416
whether I'm a conductor or a composer,

822
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,666
of any note, has any bearing on anything.

823
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:26,166
Or that my existence is
even worth talking about for this book.

824
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,250
No, I agree. I agree.

825
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,958
I think this has marked many artists
and you can see it in their work.

826
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:35,666
This seems to seep into the subconscious

827
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,333
- so that there's this great depression...
- But I know that Felicia...

828
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:41,416
She senses it enormously.

829
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,708
It's all pervasive.

830
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:46,916
It's almost as if she can't
enjoy anything anymore.

831
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I know.

832
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:51,125
- It just seems so sad.
- A picnic...

833
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:54,625
the water, lunch...

834
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:57,166
sitting around being together.

835
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,333
What is that?

836
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:03,125
I think she has a keen sense of futility.

837
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:05,041
I sense that too about her.

838
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:08,875
I had no idea
because I had this feeling of her first,

839
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:11,458
incredibly, which she is, vivacious

840
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,541
and marvelously alert and aware

841
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,375
and a happy person,

842
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,666
but something in her seems crushed.

843
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:20,541
She said to me in Vienna last month,

844
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:24,208
"I want to get off.
I want to stop the bus and get off."

845
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:25,875
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

846
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:28,875
And how do you feel about that?

847
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:33,916
I have one or two saving factors.
One is it that I love people,

848
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:38,208
and I love music. I love music so much
it keeps me glued to life

849
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:39,958
even when I'm most depressed.

850
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,875
And I can get very deeply depressed.

851
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:47,750
But I have a work ethic
and that keeps me afloat.

852
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:50,375
And the other is that
I love people so much that...

853
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:52,666
it's hard for me to be alone.

854
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:58,125
Which is part of my struggle
as a composer.

855
00:55:58,208 --> 00:55:59,458
[chuckles] Yes.

856
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:01,166
You are the only person I've met

857
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:04,125
who leaves the bathroom door open
for fear of being alone.

858
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:07,000
I mean, can one really believe that

859
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:10,291
man is just this trapped

860
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:12,625
animal.

861
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:15,916
He's a victim
of his own greeds and follies and...

862
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:25,625
Either one believes in the divine element
in this or one doesn't.

863
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,208
As long as I believe it...

864
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,916
which I assume is
why I love people so much,

865
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,833
then I have to believe that

866
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:37,541
in some remote corner of my soul
there is a way out.

867
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:42,833
<i>Okay, so, sopranos...</i>

868
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,541
you're on the hot seat.

869
00:56:46,166 --> 00:56:47,250
[laughter]

870
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:50,041
Take it from bar 44, just from the end of
"Make our garden grow,

871
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:53,000
make our garden grow,"
heading to the a cappella.

872
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:55,125
And, sopranos, make sure that you...

873
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,833
make space so that
the high notes can soar.

by Leonard Bernstein playing]

875

876
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,458
[music stops]

877
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:50,333
[speaking Spanish]

878
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,208
- [in English] It means...
- It is... "I'm dying

879
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,750
and I'm growing a hernia."

880
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,208
It's an old Chilean expression.

881
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,458
I was desperate to find a rhyme,
I couldn't.

882
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:05,458
- I woke her up...
- Your mother was from Rovno Gubernia.

883
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,458
In the middle of the night, desperate.

884
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:09,375
There's a Chilean idiom,
top of her head.

885
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,375
You woke me up from a very deep sleep.

886
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:12,958
It's the exact piece.

887
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,333
In fact, all of the Spanish here
is all from Felicia.

888
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:18,625
We're lucky that she's here today
to help with the pronunciation.

889
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,500
That's right. I'm sorry, I've been...

890
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:24,208
I was looking through Voltaire's work
and I couldn't find Rovno Gubernia.

891
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,375
That's because I made it up, my dear boy.

["Prologue - West Side Story"
by Leonard Bernstein playing]

893
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,333
Let's see what you think.

894
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,791
- See what you think.
- This is gorgeous.

895
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,291
I know, isn't it lovely?

896
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:55,250
- All right, there you go.
- Thank you.

897
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,500
Come on. Let's go.

898
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:03,708
Lenny, what do you want me to get?

899
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:06,875
You could just get that big-ass bag
of kibble.

900
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:11,958
Oh, Lord. Thank you.

901
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:15,750
[Tommy] It's Jamie.

902
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:18,083
[Leonard] And I wanted to have a drink.

[indistinct chatter]

904
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:28,958
[Nina] Daddy!

905
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:30,875
Hello, darling.

906
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:44,750
Help yourself after. Just go right there.

907
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:46,208
Is this all Felicia's idea?

908
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:48,416
I had nothing to do with it.
Her painting as well.

909
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,083
- So beautiful.
- [Felicia] Lenny.

910
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:02,208
- What is it, darling?
- Have you seen Jamie?

911
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,541
- I have not seen Jamie.
- You haven't seen her?

912
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:05,625
No.

913
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,625
- Why? Is she here?
- Yes, she's here.

914
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,458
She's terribly upset, darling.

915
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:13,791
What is she upset about?

916
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:15,708
She's been hearing gossip.

917
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,791
- Excuse me?
- Gossip.

918
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,875
- Gossip about what?
- About you, darling.

919
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,291
What about me?

920
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:27,333
I don't know.
She's been up at Tanglewood all summer.

921
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:29,416
I can't imagine what she might've heard.

922
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,041
Well, what did you tell her?

923
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:37,583
Darling, it's not for me really to say.
I said she should speak to you.

924
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,166
She's old enough, don't you think?

925
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:46,333
I don't care how old she is,
I ask that you be discreet.

926
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:52,208
I think she's completely at an age
where she needs to, deserves to know.

927
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,041
I mean, darling,
she didn't ask for any of this.

928
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:58,541
- It was my decision.
- Well, no, it's our decision.

929
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:01,708
It's not just yours.

930
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,083
Don't you dare tell her the truth.

931
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:20,458
Jamiery Creamery.

932
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,250
- [Jamie] Welcome home.
- Well, look at this.

933
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:26,666
Hello.

934
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,875
- [Jamie] Hi.
- Hello. Wow.

935
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,791
Not what I expected.

936
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,791
Did you write a new song or something?

937
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,791
I was reading. Keeping my journal.
You have a nice trip?

938
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:39,083
- Did you see Tommy?
- Oh, yes, he waved.

939
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:42,708
I thought that would make you happy.
He's gonna spend the weekend.

940
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:43,791
Wonderful.

941
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:47,375
Smart as a whip, that boy.
Keeps me on my toes.

942
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:48,958
See how he does the anagrams.

943
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:50,041
He's a sweet boy.

944
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:52,666
Yeah, you know,
your mother told me that you...

945
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:55,708
are very upset
because you heard some rumors

946
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:58,541
about me at Tanglewood this summer.

947
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,500
I really wish
she wouldn't have said anything.

948
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,416
- Jamie...
- It's fine, it's no big deal.

949
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,958
- It is a big deal because you're upset.
- I wasn't upset.

950
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:07,208
So let's discuss it.

951
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:11,083
Your mother and I
have talked about it and...

952
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,666
I said I'd come down here
and talk to you about it.

953
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:16,958
- I...
- Try to enlighten or shed some sort of

954
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:19,458
understanding on
what could've happened, so...

955
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:22,000
- Jealousy is the word that I would use.
- What?

956
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,166
Jealousy.

957
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:26,750
When I was a...

958
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,125
student at Curtis, there was a boy...

959
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:34,541
Seemed like a nice boy. Brought a pistol
to school, tried to kill me

960
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:37,041
because he was jealous of my musical...

961
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:40,541
- talent.
- Your musical talent.

962
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,250
It just drove him to the brink of murder.

963
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:49,083
Artur Rodziński was the musical director
of the New York Philharmonic.

964
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:51,916
[clears throat] God told him to hire me.

965
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:55,625
Tried to strangle me during a rehearsal.

966
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,416
Because of jealousy.

967
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:03,291
Now, I don't know what happened
or who said what or where,

968
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:07,458
but I can only imagine that
it was spurned on by jealousy, darling.

969
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:09,291
Jealousy of...

970
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:12,416
Of whatever it is that I do

971
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:17,250
that has plagued me all my life
and I apologize for plaguing you now.

972
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:21,625
But I hope that helps.

973
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,750
So the rumors aren't true?

974
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:31,416
No, darling.

975
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,125
Thank you...

976
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,250
for coming to talk to me.

977
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:50,833
I'm relieved.

978
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:16,250
- Let's go inside.
- What...

979
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:17,541
All right, what color?

980
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:19,958
[Nina] Here we have...

981
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,666
We've got three shades
of the exact same red.

982
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,583
It's not the exact same red.

983
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:26,083
This one apparently is blue.

984
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:27,375
- I'm gonna try...
- Blue...

985
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:29,875
[Alexander] So we're just giving up
on anagrams, guys?

986
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:32,166
You're gonna make it a design.

987
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,375
- [Jamie] Having a nail session.
- You're an artist.

988
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,875
Look at this, it's a little checker.

989
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:40,041
[Leonard] <i>I thought it was a good idea
for him to come for the weekend.</i>

990
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:43,458
I know how much
Jamie loves being with him.

991
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:46,166
- [Felicia] Jamie?
- You like him too, don't you?

992
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:52,541
[Felicia] Yes, I do.

993
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,000
[Leonard] Darling, if I've done

994
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:57,750
- something wrong, tell me.
- No.

995
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:01,166
No, I don't know why
Jamie is particularly...

996
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:05,083
I don't know why you said
she was particularly interested in...

997
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:08,833
[Leonard] Well, Tommy is very, sort of,
warm, and he's highly intelligent,

998
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:10,000
as is our daughter.

999
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:13,208
- [chuckles] Okay.
- And...

1000
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:16,416
- [Felicia] No, I'm not saying that...
- No, I have an interest

1001
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,000
in spending time with him too.

1002
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:21,833
I'm not trying to shove it off
that I brought him here for her.

1003
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:23,833
- Clearly not.
- Well, no, obviously not.

1004
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:26,833
[Leonard] All I'm saying is
that's just another reason why.

1005
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:29,958
- But I can easily tell him not to come.
- No.

1006
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:32,291
[Leonard] I misread the room, clearly.

1007
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:33,809
- [Felicia] No.
- I misread the room.

1008
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:36,541
[Felicia] Well, it's not really
about that. It's about...

1009
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:43,136
- [Leonard] What is it about?
- No, nothing.

1010
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,625

[Felicia] I'll do it. Okay.

- No, I just...

1016

Nothing. I thought
we were having a conversation.

The gift comes with burdens.
Do you have any idea?

1085

- The burden of feigning honesty and love.

witnessing you do it so effortlessly,

deep in our core

and accept someone

about these Thursday rehearsals

1141
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:48,166
is that we get a chance to talk to you
about what we think of the music.

1142
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,416
So, thank you for coming
and good afternoon.

1143
01:18:52,291 --> 01:18:58,625
Um, today we're studying
Shostakovich's 14th Opus 135.

1144
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:01,791
What I realized about this piece...

1145
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,916
It could be morbid,
but I tend to think that it's not...

1146
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
...is that

1147
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:11,000
as death approaches...

1148
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:14,708
I believe that an artist must

1149
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,583
cast off anything that's restraining him.

1150
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:22,250
And an artist

1151
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:27,875
must be resolute in creating,
whatever time he has left,

1152
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,958
in absolute freedom.

1153
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,958
And that's why...

1154
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,250
I have to do this for myself,

1155
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,208
I have to live...

1156
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:49,083
the rest of my life,
however long or short that may be,

1157
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:51,750
exactly the way that I want.

1158
01:19:54,083 --> 01:19:56,500
As more and more of us are
in this day and age.

- Yes, of course.
- If you don't mind.

1175
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:52,083
So, this thing where, remember if you hold
the score low you get a better bounce.

1176
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:53,708
Lower. I was doing it high.

1177
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:55,750
If we do it again,
I'd love to start at bar 44.

1178
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:58,500
And I do believe percussion
could be a little bit quiet.

1179
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:00,333
- Still have a headache?
- It's fine.

1180
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,666
- Cynthia.
- Do they realize

1181
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:04,333
it's only a matter of time
before you direct the production?

1182
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:07,500
Already happening. The carpet
was a different color yesterday.

1183
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:10,458
- I was right about the carpet.
- I agree.

1184
01:21:10,541 --> 01:21:13,166
I just forgot
how much I love being at work.

1185
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,500
- We're almost finished.
- Reservation can wait.

1186
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:18,166
- This is such a hoot. Really.
- Wait.

1187
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,625
I thought tonight was
my night to take you out.

1188
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:24,875
Oh, you both have to stop
worrying about me. I'm fine.

1189
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:27,375
- I'm busier than ever.
- [Cynthia] Better, not busier.

1190
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:30,291
Though, boy, that's true, isn't it?
I mean, doesn't the...

1191
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:32,125
[bell ringing]

1192
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:34,416
<i>Poor Murderer</i>
go into previews the next week?

1193
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,333
Don't remind me.

1194
01:21:35,416 --> 01:21:37,083
[Mendy] Who said anything about worrying?

1195
01:21:37,166 --> 01:21:39,750
I'm just greedy to have
as much of you as I can get.

1196
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:41,291
I'm all yours.

1197
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:45,375
What were you talking about?

1198
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:46,778
[Tommy]
I was talking about how...

1199
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:49,041
- What was I talking about?
- I can't remember.

1200
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:52,375
Maybe I was saying
how handsome everybody looks tonight.

1201
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:56,250
A lot of <i>hombres.</i> Lots.

1202
01:21:57,333 --> 01:21:59,541
Chicken? That's what we call them.

1203
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:01,375
[Harry] Always good with the chickens.

1204
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,000
[Tommy] You really like the chickens.

1205
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:04,791
- I love the chickens.
- I know you do.

1206
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,708
- Harry, do I...
- Yeah.

1207
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:12,208
- Just do it off there.
- Yeah.

1208
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,208
- Did you get it?
- Like a pro.

1209
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:19,125
It's raining down on me
through your fucking nose.

1210
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:21,250
It's fine. Just right over here.

1211
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:24,791
Here you go. I'll just serve everybody.

1212
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:30,375
[door opens]

1213
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:32,176
- [Tommy] Oh, Lenny...
- I'm fine. Thank you.

1214
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,541
- I'm sorry...
- It's okay. Thank you. It's fine.

1215
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:37,541
Jerry Robbins was right,
you can't maintain a relationship

1216
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:39,805
when you're living in various hotel rooms.

1217
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:41,684
- [Jamie] <i>You'll start to upset me now.</i>
- Listen.

1218
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,708
No, darling, no, I just wanted to...

1219
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:48,291
I called because I wanted to ask
what your plans were for the weekend.

1220
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:50,375
We're gonna be home in a couple of days.

1221
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:54,166
I thought we could all spend it in
Fairfield. You just have to nudge Mommy.

1222
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:55,666
<i>Who's we, Daddy?</i>

1223
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,166
No, I...

1224
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,083
Well, he's not a monster.

1225
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:02,916
He's an utterly brilliant...

1226
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:08,750
delightful fellow. He's my genius
little leprechaun. He's not even my type.

1227
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,041
<i>Daddy, please don't.</i>

1228
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:12,916
<i>Daddy, please don't talk to me about this.</i>

1229
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Darling...

1230
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:23,416
[sighs] I'm in awe of you.

1231
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:31,916
I love you so, Jamie... I love you.

1232
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:34,875
<i>I know. I know.</i>

1233
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:36,750
<i>I know.</i>

1234
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:42,708
I'll talk to Mummy again.

1235
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:45,000
<i>Okay, Daddy.</i>

1236
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:48,333
I don't know if you saw it,

1237
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:51,666
but you did get a wonderful mention
in <i>The New York Times</i> review.

1238
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:54,500
- Oh, really?
- I kept it for you. I thought I could...

1239
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:55,791
I don't wanna see it.

1240
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:58,708
No, it just makes me feel uncomfortable.

1241
01:23:58,791 --> 01:24:00,375
But that's so sweet. Thank you.

1242
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:01,541
[Jamie] All right.

1243
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:03,041
[Shirley] How was Monday night?

1244
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:07,250
Monday... No, I don't think

1245
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:08,973
- I want to talk about it.
- [Jamie] Wait.

1246
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
- What happened on Monday night?
- Nothing.

1247
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:13,083
- [Shirley] Your mother has a suitor.
- No.

1248
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:15,583
[Jamie] Really?
No, please, let's talk about it.

1249
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:20,166
I think it's enough that
you are subjected to your father's affair.

1250
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,083
So, no, I don't think we need to.

1251
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:23,916
But, speaking of your father,

1252
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,416
I do have two performances
on Thanksgiving, so...

1253
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:30,458
I'll stay at the theater
and you'll eat with him

1254
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:32,375
at the apartment with Nina and Alex.

1255
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:35,375
For Nina's sake, let's maintain
some semblance of normalcy.

1256
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:37,875
- Doesn't feel normal to me.
- [Felicia] Well, I...

1257
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:40,083
I don't know what to say.

1258
01:24:40,166 --> 01:24:43,125
- I'm running late to meet Alexander.
- [Felicia] Oh, come on.

1259
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,791
I am. You two clearly have
things to speak about.

1260
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:48,666
- No, don't do that.
- No, I'm gonna give you guys space

1261
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,375
- to speak about it.
- That's not how we do things.

1262
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:53,458
Grownups don't do that.

1263
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:56,375
- I did make plans with Alexander...
- No. Darling.

1264
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:59,083
We're not leaving like this.
Look at me in the eye.

1265
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:02,375
I can see how cross you are
and I don't want you to go like that.

1266
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:05,083
- I'm not cross with you.
- I don't believe you.

1267
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,208
[Jamie] Hold on.

1268
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:09,583
I am not angry with you, Mummy.

1269
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:12,291
[whispers] You're a terrible liar.

1270
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,833
- At least you know you can trust me.
- That's true.

1271
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:16,833
- I'm gonna clear.
- [Felicia] No.

1272
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:18,750
- Got to make fun of him...
- I love you.

1273
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:21,666
For not coming to see you yet,
rave about your performance.

1274
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:23,166
Well, that'd be wonderful.

1275
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:27,958
Okay, now, tell me about the suitor.

1276
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:30,250
Oh, so, yes, the suitor...

1277
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:33,500
Uh, so...

1278
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:36,541
I was very excited, as you know.

1279
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:39,416
- I was very excited, as you know.
- I do.

1280
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,625
- We went out for lunch, not dinner.
- Where?

1281
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:43,291
Café Carlyle, nothing fancy.

1282
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:46,791
And I was a little nervous,
I'll admit, so was he.

1283
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:50,333
So, halfway through the meal,
he leans over,

1284
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:54,500
and he asks if he can tell me a secret.

1285
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:57,583
- He has a little crush, you see.
- Indeed.

1286
01:25:58,791 --> 01:26:02,583
So, I smiled, I blushed a little
and I pushed him to tell me.

1287
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:04,875
He has a crush on Mendy

1288
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,166
and he wants me to introduce them.

1289
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:11,000
- Mendy Wager?
- Mendy.

1290
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,583
Don't be so surprised.
Mendy's a very handsome man.

1291
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:16,875
- Felicia...
- There I was...

1292
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:20,833
blushing, butterflies all-a-tremble, and...

1293
01:26:21,583 --> 01:26:22,583
Well...

1294
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:25,208
seems I'm attracted to a certain type.

1295
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:27,750
Listen...

1296
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:31,875
You know, Lenny loves you, he really does.

1297
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:36,583
He's just... a man. A horribly aging man...

1298
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:41,958
who cannot just be wholly one thing.

1299
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:44,666
He's just... lost.

1300
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:46,500
I've always known who he is.

1301
01:26:49,916 --> 01:26:51,125
He called me, you know.

1302
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:53,375
And?

1303
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,291
He wants us all to go
to Fairfield for two weeks.

1304
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,333
- He sounded different.
- Felicia...

1305
01:26:59,416 --> 01:27:00,416
No, I...

1306
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,125
Let's not make excuses. He didn't fail me.

1307
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:05,625
- Felicia...
- No, it's...

1308
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:08,791
It's my own arrogance

1309
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:12,791
to think I could survive
on what he could give.

1310
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:16,791
It's ironic. I would look at everyone,
even my children

1311
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:20,000
with such pity because
of their longing for his attention.

1312
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:22,833
It was sort of a banner
I wore so proudly,

1313
01:27:22,916 --> 01:27:24,750
I don't need. I don't need.

1314
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:26,458
And...

1315
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:28,958
look at me now.

1316
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,375
Who's the one who hasn't been honest?

1317
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:39,500
I miss him...

1318
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:42,250
that child of mine.

1319
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:49,250
Any questions?

There is no hate...
There is no hate in your heart.

- Mr. Bernstein, you can come back now.
- Oh, wonderful.

- Yes.

01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:46,791
You seem like you need
your blood pressure taken.

1340
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:48,083
No, I'm fine.

1341
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:53,666
You know Betty's coming
for dinner tonight?

1342
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,041
- I didn't know that.
- She is.

1343
01:35:57,875 --> 01:36:00,291
And Mendy, which will be so nice.

1344
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:05,000
And Julia's gone to go and get fennel,
which you know Betty loves.

1345
01:36:10,375 --> 01:36:12,916
- [knock on door]
- Come in.

1346
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:15,750
- Hello.
- [Dr. Kruger] How are you?

1347
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:24,583
It looks like you have a tumor
of the right side of the left breast

1348
01:36:24,666 --> 01:36:27,083
which may have metastasized to the lung.

1349
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:30,083
Given the size of the tumor,

1350
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:32,500
I would recommend
that we remove the breast,

1351
01:36:32,583 --> 01:36:35,916
the underlying muscles
and the adjacent lymph nodes,

1352
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,333
as well as do a biopsy of the lung

1353
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:41,291
which will help us confirm
whether there is spread or not.

1354
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,625
We could do all of this
early next week if you like.

1355
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:47,041
Yes.

1356
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,333
But I'm... Darling...

1357
01:36:50,416 --> 01:36:52,500
- I'm starting a play in September.
- That's okay.

1358
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:55,250
- No, but I should let them know...
- I'll let them know.

1359
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:58,916
I think your recovery
will be faster than you think

1360
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,208
and we can have you ready
within about one to two weeks.

1361
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:05,958
- That's wonderful news.
- You'll be able to do what you need to do.

1362
01:37:06,041 --> 01:37:08,875
How can we be assured
that we get all the cancer?

1363
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:11,875
- Well...
- ...that we get all the cancer.

1364
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:15,500
We're not gonna compromise on that
for the play...

1365
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:18,333
Once we take off the breast,
there'll be no local cancer.

1366
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,583
We do have to determine about the lung.

1367
01:37:20,666 --> 01:37:22,250
How long would the biopsy take?

1368
01:37:22,333 --> 01:37:27,250
The biopsy, just minutes, and you'll be
sleeping from the other procedure.

1369
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:28,958
So, you do it... you do...

1370
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:32,166
You do both at the same time?

1371
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:35,833
Yeah, we do the breast and it'd be easy
to do the biopsy of the lung.

1372
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:40,625
[crying]

1373
01:37:42,083 --> 01:37:43,916
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1374
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:46,166
- I know...
- I know.

1375
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:53,791
[door closes]

1376
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:57,083
- I know.
- That's so ridiculous.

1377
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:58,666
No, I know.

1378
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:01,916
I'm so ridiculous.

1379
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:05,000
There, there. It's okay, darling.

1380
01:38:16,666 --> 01:38:18,666
No, I don't really think so, darling.

1381
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:30,125
- Darling.
- Thank you.

1382
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:36,916
- Darling, let's take the park and walk.
- Really?

1383
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:38,625
Yes.

1384
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:40,541
Yes, let's get some air.

1385
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:42,458
Okay.

1386
01:38:45,041 --> 01:38:46,601
- [Felicia] Oh, my God.
- You all right?

1387
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:47,833
[Felicia] No, I'm fine.

1388
01:38:47,916 --> 01:38:50,625
- There's something wrong with my knee.
- I have an idea.

1389
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:51,708
[Felicia] Oh, no.

1390
01:38:56,458 --> 01:38:57,291
[lighter clicking]

1391
01:38:57,375 --> 01:38:59,000
Is that a lighter, darling?

1392
01:39:00,041 --> 01:39:01,541
Mind your own business.

1393
01:39:05,166 --> 01:39:08,166
["Age of Anxiety"
by Leonard Bernstein playing]

1394
01:39:13,041 --> 01:39:14,458
I'm thinking of a number.

1395
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:16,333
[Felicia laughs]

1396
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:23,416
- Oh, I don't know. Nine.
- No.

1397
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:25,791
- Five.
- No, you have to think.

1398
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:28,041
I'm trying to.

1399
01:39:29,208 --> 01:39:30,291
I am trying to.

1400
01:39:31,041 --> 01:39:32,541
- It's two, darling.
- Two.

1401
01:39:32,625 --> 01:39:33,625
It's two.

1402
01:39:34,125 --> 01:39:35,666
- Like us.
- Hmm?

1403
01:39:36,291 --> 01:39:38,375
- Like us, a pair.
- Mmm.

1404
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:41,458
Two little ducks in a pond.

1405
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:49,125
Throw your weight on me, darling.

1406
01:39:49,666 --> 01:39:52,875
That's it. Put all your weight on me.
Yes, that's it.

1407
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:54,583
Lean your head back. That's it.

1408
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:04,500
[Cynthia] Oh, my dear.

1409
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:06,583
Hello, dears.

1410
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:09,125
Hello.

1411
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:14,041
[Mendy] Gorgeous.

1412
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:15,750
Missed you.

1413
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:17,250
Missed you so much.

1414
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:20,250
[Jamie] Mummy? You all right?

1415
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:21,958
I'm good. I'm fine.

1416
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:24,833
[Cynthia sighs]

1417
01:40:24,916 --> 01:40:26,916
Did you have a nightmare getting here?

1418
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,875
[Cynthia] Of course.
This one was driving.

1419
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:31,333
- Oh, no.
- [Mendy] I don't think we could've gone

1420
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:34,708
- farther east if we'd tried.
- [Cynthia] You know I hate driving.

1421
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:37,416
Oh, I wish I'd come earlier. Is there...

1422
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:40,750
Is there anything you need?

1423
01:40:41,416 --> 01:40:42,625
Anything I can do?

1424
01:40:45,166 --> 01:40:47,000
Never get another perm.

1425
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,041
[Cynthia and Mendy laugh]

1426
01:40:49,125 --> 01:40:51,250
[Mendy] That's what I said.

1427
01:40:51,333 --> 01:40:53,083
[Cynthia] Ramone said it was a triumph.

1428
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:55,291
[Mendy] It's a gigantic triumph.

1429
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:00,666
[Cynthia] Where's Lenny?

1430
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:03,625
Oh, I don't know,
he's sleeping or something.

1431
01:41:04,708 --> 01:41:06,333
Do you remember that...

1432
01:41:06,958 --> 01:41:09,333
that bar mitzvah that you dragged me to,

1433
01:41:09,416 --> 01:41:11,041
one of Alexander's friends?

1434
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:12,958
- The little... Yes.
- I do.

1435
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:15,041
With...

1436
01:41:15,958 --> 01:41:17,250
Oh, what's his name?

1437
01:41:17,333 --> 01:41:18,958
- Feldman. Yeah.
- [Cynthia] Yes!

1438
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:23,208
So, we're there and I am, of course,
seated next to our dear Felicia here.

1439
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:26,250
And she looks stunning as usual.
Woe is me.

1440
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:30,500
And Lenny's about 25 pounds lighter.

1441
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:34,666
And tanned, just tanned,
all in white from head to toe,

1442
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:38,166
including white patent-leather shoes
with no socks.

1443
01:41:38,916 --> 01:41:40,500
It was very <i>en vogue.</i>

1444
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:41,583
[Mendy] A lie.

1445
01:41:43,416 --> 01:41:45,041
[Cynthia] Well, at one point Lenny,

1446
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:48,125
he gets up, you know,
in that all-white attire

1447
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:51,916
and he makes his way
up to the lectern. Um...

1448
01:41:53,125 --> 01:41:54,500
- [coughing]
- Yes.

1449
01:42:07,708 --> 01:42:09,916
No, it's fine. The, um...

1450
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:14,208
- Lenny in the white suit.
- [Cynthia] Yes.

1451
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:18,250
And he's all in white... and, um...

1452
01:42:19,583 --> 01:42:20,583
he...

1453
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,958
Uh, he goes up to the lectern and...

1454
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:29,208
- I don't think anybody asked him to speak.
- No.

1455
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:31,083
But...

1456
01:42:31,791 --> 01:42:34,916
it took him 20 minutes
just to walk from our table up there,

1457
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,958
stopping at every table he passed,
chit-chatting of course,

1458
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:42,041
and finally, he arrives up there
next to the frightened boy.

1459
01:42:43,083 --> 01:42:45,916
And Felicia leans up to me

1460
01:42:47,625 --> 01:42:49,250
without missing a beat and says,

1461
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:51,625
"And now we have the bride."

1462
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:53,333

[piano music playing]

1464
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
[Mendy] He's risen.

1466
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:06,625
Oh.

- [Felicia] Oh, my God.
- [Mendy] A production.

1468
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:20,916
[Felicia] Watch it, Jamie.

1469
01:43:35,041 --> 01:43:36,125
[Leonard] I'll see you.

1470
01:43:36,208 --> 01:43:38,208
Okay. All right, bye. See you.

1471
01:43:38,833 --> 01:43:39,833
Love you.

1473
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:49,166
I don't want any more visitors.

1474
01:43:49,833 --> 01:43:52,250
No more. No more. I want to go to bed.

1475
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:53,333
Yes, okay.

1476
01:43:54,166 --> 01:43:57,250
[Leonard] <i>Yes. No, you're gonna
have to cancel it. Yes.</i>

1477
01:43:57,875 --> 01:43:58,875
Well...

1478
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:00,541
No, I'm not leaving.

1479
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:02,791
That's out of the question.

1480
01:44:02,875 --> 01:44:06,208
I've had a relationship with the orchestra
for 15 years, they'll understand.

1481
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,083
No, that...

1482
01:44:10,791 --> 01:44:13,958
I'm not leaving here, Harry.
You're gonna have to figure it out.

1483
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:15,958
Yes.

1484
01:44:20,291 --> 01:44:21,500
Yes, we're doing fine.

[crying]

1487
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:35,125
- Are you using the bathroom?
- No, I can't.

1488
01:45:35,208 --> 01:45:37,333
- You have to drink your water.
- I'm trying.

1489
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:40,833
Oh, my God,
I'm freezing cold all the time.

1490
01:45:40,916 --> 01:45:43,875
No, don't help me. I don't need help.

1491
01:45:43,958 --> 01:45:46,375
I don't need it. I don't need it.

1492
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:47,541
Let go.

1493
01:45:48,166 --> 01:45:50,666
Get into bed, come on.
I don't need all this fuss.

1494
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:53,750
- Are the pillows all right?
- Honestly, they're fine. Come on.

1495
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,833
- Just lie down. Lie down.
- Okay.

1496
01:46:08,416 --> 01:46:11,666
[sobs] Sorry. Sorry.

1497
01:46:12,541 --> 01:46:13,625
I'm sorry.

1498
01:46:16,583 --> 01:46:17,583
You know...

1499
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:21,541
all you need...

1500
01:46:24,166 --> 01:46:28,166
all anyone needs
is to be sensitive to others.

1501
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:31,958
Kindness.

1502
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:38,000
Kindness. Kindness.

1503
01:46:43,583 --> 01:46:47,000
Darling, it's ten minutes past half hour.
Did you take your medicine?

1504
01:46:47,791 --> 01:46:50,208
- No, I don't...
- How's your pain threshold?

1505
01:46:53,291 --> 01:46:55,125
I think he told me not to take it.

1506
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,833
- Who told you?
- Arkell.

1507
01:46:58,625 --> 01:46:59,625
