I believe this is yours.

00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,964
Thanks.

Next.

7
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,288
Your names?

8
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,336
Great. And how do we spell that?

9
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,053
How about we just go with Bernie and Cinder?

10
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,516
Welcome to Element City.

11
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,774
Hot logs.
Hot logs for sale.

12
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,914
Cantankerous guy...

13
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,458
Hey, watch it, Sparky!

14
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,188
Water.

15
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,450
Dry leaves.

16
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,732
I'm okay.

17
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,212
Welcome, my Ember, to your new life.

18
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,180
Our Blue Flame hold all our traditions...

19
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,975
and give us strength to burn bright.

20
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,857
Do I burn as bright?

21
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,905
One, two, one, two, one, two.

22
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,254
This shop is dream of our family.

23
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,882
Someday it'll all be yours.

24
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:44,970
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

25
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,346
Everything here authentic.

26
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,056
Then I've got to try the kol-nuts.

27
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,433
Kol-nuts, coming up.

28
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,976
Kol-nut, coming up.

29
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:52,978
Good daughter.

30
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,026
Someday this shop will all be mine.

31
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,820
When you are ready.

32
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,246
Delivery!

33
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,123
Two sugar pops, please.

34
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,708
I got it, <i>Àshfá.</i>

35
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,845
Hey!

36
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,643
Water. Keep an eye on them.

37
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,186
Oops.

38
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,604
Oops.

39
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,481
You splash it, you buy it.

40
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,903
You showed them, huh?

41
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,738
Nobody waters down Fire.

42
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,906
Yeah!

43
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,660
Can the shop be mine now?

44
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,328
When you are ready.

45
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,664
{\an8}<i>-The truth is...
</i>-She's not in love with him.

46
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,499
<i>...I'm not in love with you.</i>

47
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,751
Knew it.

48
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,343
<i>Àshfá</i>, customer.

49
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,137
How about you take it today?

50
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,681
For real?

51
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,190
How can I help you?

52
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,942
All of this and the...

53
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,360
The sparklers are buy one, get one free?

54
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,611
-That's right.
-Great!

55
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,071
I'll just take the free one.

56
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,531
No, see...

57
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,616
you need to buy one to get one free.

58
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,369
{\an8}But I just want the free one.

59
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,872
Sorry, that's not how this works.

60
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,124
{\an8}But the customer is always right.

61
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,792
Not in this case.

62
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,253
Nope.

63
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,715
Nope. Nope. Nope.

64
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,175
Just give me one for free!

65
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,843
That's not how this works!

66
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,849
Happy birthday.

67
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,351
What just happened?
Why you lose temper?

68
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,396
I don't know.
He was pushing, and pushing, and it just...

69
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,981
Calm, calm.

70
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,275
Sometimes customer can be tough.

71
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,235
Just take breath...

72
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,821
and make connection.

73
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,158
When you can do that and not lose temper...

74
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,119
then you will be ready to take over shop.

75
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,374
This is too expensive,
and that is not made in Fire Land.

76
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,375
-They weren't crunchy...
-Take breath.

77
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,877
-...and there wasn't enough sauce.
-Make connection.

78
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,922
Take breath.
Make connection.

79
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,882
Take breath.
Make connection.

80
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,717
Take breath.
Make connection!

81
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,807
Sorry. Sorry about that.
Sorry, sorry.

82
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,854
She almost went full purple.
I've never seen anyone go full purple.

83
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,397
Sorry, everyone.

84
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,899
Please forgive my daughter.

85
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,027
She burn bright, but sometimes too bright.

86
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,696
Nice hat, by the way.

87
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,449
Let me make you a new batch.
On the house.

88
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,617
Okay.

89
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,494
Sorry, <i>Àshfá.</i>

90
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,538
I don't know why that one
got away from me.

91
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:01,250
You are tense
because of big Red Dot Sale tomorrow.

92
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,085
It has us all in a broil.

93
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,253
I guess.

94
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,256
It's just that some of these customers,
they get me all...

95
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,676
I know. I know. Just do what we practice.

96
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,594
{\an8}You are so good at everything else.

97
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,555
You're right.
I'll get it.

98
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,181
I just want you to rest.

99
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,188
Done.

100
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,235
{\an8}You okay?

101
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:29,862
{\an8}Just tired.

102
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:30,988
{\an8}Let me help.

103
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,993
Bernie, that cough is terrible!

104
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,829
Almost as terrible as your cooking!

105
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,709
When you gonna put Ember
out of her misery and retire, huh?

106
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,253
Finally put her name on the sign out there?

107
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,839
She take over when she's ready.

108
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,883
And speaking of ready...

109
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,802
we are more than ready
for you to actually buy something...

110
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,721
if you'd ever get up off your lazy ash.

111
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,431
Burn!

112
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,643
But she is so close.

113
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,355
I mean, she'll probably never do deliveries
as quick as me...

114
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,191
You don't think that I can beat your record?

115
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,067
Because I have been taking it easy on you...

116
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,653
so I don't hurt your feelings,
Mr. Smokestack.

117
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,614
But game on.

118
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,620
{\an8}Before I see if you are a match...

119
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,039
I splash this on your heart...

120
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,082
to bring love to the surface.

121
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,544
And I will read the smoke.

122
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,843
Ember, I'm doing a reading.

123
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,262
Sorry, got to grab some stuff.
Going for Dad's record.

124
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,264
So, are we a match?

125
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,141
It's true love.

126
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,853
Which is more than I ever smelled
on this one.

127
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,522
Goody, this old chestnut.

128
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,525
Yep. Nothing.

129
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,862
Just a loveless, sad future of sadness.

130
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,656
Ember, work with me.

131
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,909
Your finding match
was my mother's dying wish.

132
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,828
Promise me one thing...

133
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,039
marry Fire.

134
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,085
Nice try, Mom. Got to go.

135
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,129
-Save it for the wedding.
-Hey.

136
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,924
Yo, yo, yo, Ember.

137
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,509
Yo, Clod. Can't talk, in a hurry.

138
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,469
And don't let my dad
catch you out here again.

139
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,973
What? Come on,
he doesn't like my landscaping?

140
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,850
Anyway, June Bloom is coming...

141
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,895
and you just got to be my date
'cause check it out.

142
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,022
I'm all grown up.

143
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,276
And I smell good.

144
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,820
My queen.

145
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,074
Sorry, buddy, elements don't mix.

146
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,785
Flame.
Gotta go.

147
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,954
Come on, go to the festival with me.

148
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,747
You never leave this part of town.

149
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,250
That's because everything I need
is right here.

150
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,466
Plus, the city isn't made
with Fire people in mind.

151
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,012
Sorry, but it'd take an act of God
to get me across that bridge.

152
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,263
An act of God?

153
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,807
Or an act of Clod?

154
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,894
Gotta run.

155
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,995
As ordered.

156
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,043
Gotta run.
Going for Dad's record.

157
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,005
Move it!

158
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,817
Winner winner, charcoal dinner...

159
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,719
Head to bed, I'll close things up.

160
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,764
Still have much to prepare for Red Dot Sale.

161
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,767
Dad, I'll take care of it.
You need to rest.

162
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,104
How?

163
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,605
I learned from the best.

164
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,486
I am old. I can't do this forever.

165
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,157
Now that you've beaten my time,
there's only one thing you haven't done.

166
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,201
Tomorrow I sleep in...

167
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,454
and I want you to run shop for Red Dot Sale.

168
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,373
Seriously? By myself?

169
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,334
If you can do that
without losing your temper...

170
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,879
it will show me you are able to take over.

171
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:58,881
You got it, <i>Àshfá.</i>

172
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,845
I won't let you down, I swear.
You'll see.

173
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,598
Good daughter.

174
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,352
Yes!

175
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:17,524
Blue Flame, please, let this go my way.

176
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,077
-Good morning!
-Morning!

177
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,876
Take a breath.

178
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,048
Calm as a candle.

179
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,929
Morning, welcome to The Fireplace.

180
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,937
Whoa, whoa. They're all the same.
Just take one from the top.

181
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,104
Thanks for shopping.

182
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,732
So many stickers for sale.

183
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,443
-Are these fragile?
-No, wait.

184
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,154
You have to pay before you eat.

185
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,741
What's your return policy?

186
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,493
Does this come in a large?

187
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:11,912
Take breath.

188
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:12,996
My dad broke this.

189
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,122
Make connection.

190
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,999
Mind if I test this kettle?

191
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,170
Be back in five minutes.

192
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,918
No, no, no.

193
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,547
Stupid temper. Not today.

194
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,135
What is wrong with me?

195
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,356
What the...?

196
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,152
What a happy family.

197
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,446
Is that you and your dad?

198
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:28,989
I love dads.

199
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,284
And it's your birthday.

200
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,537
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

201
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,538
I don't know.

202
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,709
I was searching for a leak on the other side
of the river and got sucked in.

203
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,003
This is bad, I can't lose another job.

204
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,132
I just can't seem to find my flow.

205
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,051
Dang!

206
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,261
That pipe squished me all out of shape.

207
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:53,555
That's better.

208
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,098
Dude, just get out of here.

209
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,392
I gotta clean this mess
before my dad sees what I did.

210
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,646
Actually...

211
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,069
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to write you a ticket.

212
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,569
-A ticket?
-Yeah.

213
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:12,074
I'm a city inspector,
and this pipe is definitely not up to code.

214
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,160
I sucked a city inspector into our pipes?

215
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,204
I know. Ironic, right?

216
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,288
Stop messing with that.

217
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,915
-Well, I need to make sure it's solid.
-Everything's solid.

218
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,752
I should know.
My dad rebuilt this place himself.

219
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,588
Wait, your dad did?

220
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:30,133
Yes, with his bare hands,
every brick and board.

221
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,844
It was a ruin when he found it.

222
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,138
Wow. He did all of this himself?

223
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,390
Without permits?

224
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,726
I'm gonna have to write that up too.

225
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,311
First, I'm sucked into a pipe...

226
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,356
and now I have to write citations
that could get this place shut down.

227
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,733
Oh, gosh. It's just too much.

228
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,485
Shut us down?

229
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,445
I know, it's awful.

230
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,281
No, you can't shut us down, please.

231
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,741
This is a big day for me.
It's our Red Dot Sale.

232
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,120
Hey, take it easy.
This is as hard on me as it is on you.

233
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,538
-Get back here.
-Sorry.

234
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,332
I got to get these to City Hall
before the end of my shift.

235
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,421
Flame.

236
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,843
Get back here.

237
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,227
<i>Next stop, Element City.</i>

238
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,170
-Hey!
-Sorry.

239
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:07,773
Hey!

240
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,072
What the...?

241
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,621
<i>This stop, City Hall.</i>

242
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,123
Hands off!

243
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,544
Sorry.

244
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,426
Stop!

245
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,224
Hey!

246
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:46,478
Stop.

247
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,398
My new jacket.

248
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:50,858
Whoa!

249
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,852
Hey!

250
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,024
My chili oil!

251
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,444
Come on, guy.

252
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,987
You can't get through this.

253
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,407
So, it is time to hand them over.

254
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:41,992
Oh, boy, I'm sorry.

255
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,328
This is gonna be
really disappointing for you.

256
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,246
No, no, no.

257
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,539
No, no, no.

258
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,957
Sorry.

259
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,292
Please...

260
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,460
No.

261
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,922
You don't understand.

262
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,470
This shop is my dad's dream.

263
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,723
If I'm the reason it gets shut down...

264
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,933
it will kill him.

265
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,645
He will never trust me to take over.

266
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,940
Why didn't you say that before?

267
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,151
Wait, does that mean
you'll tear up the tickets?

268
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,946
I mean, I would, but I just sent them over...

269
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,155
to the processing department.

270
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,158
But I can take you there
so you can plead your case.

271
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,517
Hey, Fern.

272
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:49,768
How you doing?

273
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,854
Living the dream.

274
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,732
You know those citations
I just gave you from Firetown?

275
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,403
I was about to send them to Mrs. Cumulus.

276
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,864
Then get sprayed for fungus rot.

277
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,948
Wait.

278
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,327
Tell him what you told me
about your dad and letting him down.

279
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,537
No. That's personal.

280
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:09,788
It really got to me.

281
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,248
He might feel it too.

282
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,750
-Her dad will be...
-Nope. Nope.

283
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,211
...super disappointed in her.

284
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,129
Stop it.

285
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,882
He might even be ashamed.

286
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,008
What are you doing?

287
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,342
But the main thing is...

288
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,971
if her father can't retire,
it will be all Ember's...

289
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,681
Stop talking!

290
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,821
Looks like I'm going home early today.

291
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:43,989
No, don't.

292
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,785
Expect to get shut down within a week.

293
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:49,786
Have a good one.

294
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,750
Sorry.

295
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,007
What?

296
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,092
Already?

297
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:05,802
Hello?

298
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,023
Oh, no.

299
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,483
Dad, what happened?

300
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,945
We lucky nobody hurt.
It ruined Red Dot Sale.

301
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,655
-Did he do this?
-Who?

302
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,823
The Water guy I see you chase.

303
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:30,994
Yeah, he did.

304
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:34,581
He just broke through a pipe.
I don't know why.

305
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:38,210
Luckily, I was able to close it off.
I couldn't catch him though.

306
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,879
Water, always trying to water us down.

307
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:44,091
He was a Water person, Dad, not just water.

308
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,593
Same thing.
And why is water in pipes?

309
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,597
City shut down years ago.
There should be no water.

310
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:52,432
Dad!

311
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,102
Bernie.

312
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:56,687
We will get through this.

313
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,146
Just like before.

314
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,565
Before?

315
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,359
There is a reason we left Fire Land.

316
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,280
Ember, we loved it there so much.

317
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,491
Most everyone had a Blue Flame.

318
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,910
And it connected us all together.

319
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,038
To our traditions. Our family.

320
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,040
<i>It was hard living.</i>

321
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,085
<i>But your father began to build a life for us.</i>

322
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,004
<i>We put everything into it.</i>

323
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,423
<i>But then a great storm came.</i>

324
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,895
<i>All was lost for us.</i>

325
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:43,817
<i>Your father understood
we had to leave everything.</i>

326
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:48,238
<i>Our home. It was the only way
to create a better life.</i>

327
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,876
<i>It was the last time
your father ever saw his family.</i>

328
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:05,506
That is why we came here.

329
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,508
To build all this.

330
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:18,852
<i>Àshfá</i>, nothing will happen to this shop
or the flame again, I promise.

331
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,481
Good daughter.

332
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:36,745
Fire! Fire!

333
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,455
-Fire!
-Hey, hey!

334
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:39,498
Sorry.

335
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,208
You're so hot.

336
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,085
Excuse me?

337
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,255
No, I mean, like, you're smoking.

338
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,464
No, I didn't mean it like that.

339
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,341
-Are you done yet?
-Yes, please.

340
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:50,926
I'm waiting to talk to your boss.

341
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:54,054
So, make like a stream
and flow somewhere else.

342
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,889
Actually, Gale won't be in today.

343
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,808
She's a huge airball fan...

344
00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:00,310
and the Windbreakers
are finally in the playoffs.

345
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:01,812
Toot toot.

346
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:04,606
Okay. Well, I just came by...

347
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,192
because I left my passes
for the game here last night.

348
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,862
Passes? Like, plural?

349
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:41,977
Where is she?

350
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:43,520
Up there, in that skybox.

351
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,647
Come on!

352
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,568
Okay. Time to cancel some tickets.

353
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,321
Toot Toot juice.

354
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,781
Get your Toot Toot juice.

355
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:59,494
Toot Toot juice,
get your Toot Toot juice.

356
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,039
You'll be great. This way.

357
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,624
-Excuse me.
-Jimmy, what's up?

358
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,834
-Sorry. Pardon.
-Wendy.

359
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,961
Sorry. Fire girl coming through.

360
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,797
Break some wind!

361
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,299
Hi, Gale, how you doing?

362
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,259
Look at the score, what do you think?

363
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,762
Blow the ball, not the game!

364
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,599
Yeah, so, Gale.

365
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:24,770
My name is Ember Lumen.
My family runs a Fire shop.

366
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,730
Wade wrote us a bunch of tickets yesterday...

367
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,774
What kind of call was that?

368
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,860
Lumen? Yeah, a Fire shop
with 30 citations.

369
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,445
Thirty?

370
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:37,658
Anyway, friend, I was hoping
we could work something out.

371
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:41,036
Come on, ref!
Are your eyes in the back of your head?

372
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,874
-Oh, no.
-Yeah, bummer.

373
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,961
Yeah. Okay, so, the 30 citations.

374
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,840
Do you mind? There's a game going on.
Fireball.

375
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,383
Fireball?

376
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,885
Actually, I do mind.

377
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:00,013
This is my life we're talking about.
Not just some game.

378
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,808
Some game?
This is the playoffs.

379
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,644
So, forgive me
if I don't want to hear a sob story...

380
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,438
about the problems of some little shop.

381
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,483
Well, that little shop matters way more...

382
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,736
than a bunch of overpaid cloud puffs
blowing some ball around.

383
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,405
I dare you...

384
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:19,908
say "cloud puffs" one more time.

385
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,870
Cloud puffs.

386
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,081
Oh, no!

387
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:27,082
Lutz!

388
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,680
Lutz, man. He's been in such a funk
'cause his mom has been sick.

389
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:49,104
That is so not cool, he's doing his best.

390
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:52,482
We love you, Lutz!

391
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,818
Lutz!

392
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:58,322
We love you, Lutz!

393
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:01,200
We love you, Lutz!
Come on!

394
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:04,077
We love you, Lutz! Everybody!

395
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:07,706
We love you, Lutz!
We love you, Lutz!

396
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,792
We love you, Lutz!
We love you, Lutz!

397
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,693
-Yay!
-Yeah! Way to go, Lutz!

398
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,946
Yeah, Lutz!

399
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:40,614
That was amazing, Lutz!

400
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:44,910
Yeah! Yeah! Yes!

401
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:57,506
What a comeback.

402
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:00,342
Check out who found the gift shop.

403
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:03,262
I gotta admit, that was pretty cool.

404
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,806
You can see why I can get all churned up...

405
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:09,560
but as a cloud puff who used to
come here with her dad...

406
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,895
all these wins mean a little bit more.

407
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:15,691
And as a fireball who's supposed
to take over her dad's shop...

408
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:19,027
I sure don't want to let him down,
and I could use a win, too.

409
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,614
Now, I just got to stop water
from coming in.

410
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,200
-Water? In Firetown?
-Yeah.

411
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,202
Water was shut off to there years ago.

412
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:28,203
Forget the tickets...

413
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,332
I'm gonna have to take apart your dad's shop
to figure out what's going on.

414
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,500
You can't!

415
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,420
My dad put his whole life into that place.

416
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,964
I bet this is connected
to that fluffing leak.

417
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,884
Yeah, we've been trying
to track down a leak in the city.

418
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,552
It's why I was in the canal and...

419
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,014
Wait, I know where
I got sucked into Ember's shop.

420
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:51,101
Ember and I could track the water
from her shop to find the source of the leak.

421
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:52,519
Keep talking.

422
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:55,189
I could call in a city crew
to fix whatever we find.

423
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:59,026
Yes. And there'd be no need
to touch my dad's shop.

424
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,779
You're lucky you're a cute couple.

425
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:03,989
We're not a...

426
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,032
You got until Friday.

427
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:08,327
If you can find the leak
and get a crew to fix it by then...

428
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,745
those tickets are forgiven.

429
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:13,665
If not, your dad's shop gets shut down.

430
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,252
Break wind! Break wind!

431
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:18,420
Thank you.

432
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,467
-Please take all that off.
-But I got you a hat.

433
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:29,181
Okay.

434
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:33,352
Just keep out of sight, okay?
It'd be a whole thing.

435
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,103
Now water upstairs?

436
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,272
It's in the walls.

437
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:41,193
I don't understand.
I fix one pipe and another one leaks.

438
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:42,694
Water!

439
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:46,865
How could it be worse?

440
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:50,827
Now that the water's back, the pressure
is forcing it up to all your pipes.

441
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,538
We gotta find the source.

442
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:54,748
How did you even end up here?

443
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:59,086
Well, I was in the canals
checking the doors for leaks...

444
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,421
<i>when I found some water
that shouldn't have been there.</i>

445
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,259
Rusty with a hint of motor oil?

446
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:07,803
<i>There was this whoosh of water.</i>

447
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,931
<i>And I got sucked into a filtering system.</i>

448
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,099
Help!

449
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,726
<i>But then I heard this explosion.</i>

450
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,941
<i>That's how I ended up at your place.</i>

451
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:24,069
Oh, flame! My temper caused this.

452
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:27,072
So, we're searching for water
somewhere in a canal?

453
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:29,116
Those canals go everywhere.

454
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:32,327
It's why tracking down that leak
has been so dang hard.

455
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:33,328
The roof.

456
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,005
You might want to step back.

457
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,888
Holy dew drop!

458
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:52,764
Get in.

459
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,958
Okay, that's where I got sucked in.

460
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,504
More water.
Go that way.

461
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:30,469
Yeah, right there.

462
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,306
Nothing weird going on here.

463
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,642
Just a little pruning.

464
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:55,452
So, what do you do at the shop?
If you don't mind me asking.

465
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,121
My dad's retiring and I'll be taking over.

466
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,289
Someday.

467
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,583
When I'm ready.

468
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,669
It must be nice knowing what you're gonna do.

469
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:06,380
After my dad passed,
I got all, "What's the point?"

470
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,799
Now I just go from one job to the next.

471
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,176
There's a word in Firish.

472
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:12,594
<i>Tìshók.</i>

473
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:16,931
It means embrace the light while it burns
because it won't always last forever.

474
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:21,143
Tee-shook.

475
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:23,188
Or something like that.

476
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,696
-You okay?
-Yeah.

477
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:31,864
You sure?

478
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:35,826
It's just, that building over there...

479
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,078
that's Garden Central Station.

480
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:43,292
When I was a kid, my dad took me there
because they had a Vivisteria tree.

481
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,460
<i>I'd always wanted to see one.</i>

482
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:49,922
<i>It's the only flower that can thrive
in any environment.</i>

483
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,010
<i>Fire included.</i>

484
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,888
<i>I was so excited.</i>

485
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:58,182
<i>But they said our fire was too dangerous...</i>

486
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:00,475
<i>and they wouldn't let us in.</i>

487
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,520
Go back to Fire Land.

488
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,147
<i>My dad was so angry...</i>

489
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:07,482
-Burn somewhere else!
-Get outta here!

490
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:08,859
<i>...and embarrassed.</i>

491
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,445
The building flooded a few years later.

492
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,448
So, I missed my one chance
to see a Vivisteria.

493
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,662
You must have been so scared.

494
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:23,874
I was.

495
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,419
How do you do that?

496
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:29,338
-Do what?
-Draw people in?

497
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,507
You got a whole stadium to connect with you.

498
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:34,593
I can't even connect with one customer.

499
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,637
My stupid temper always kicks in.

500
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,389
I guess I just say what I feel.

501
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,433
And I don't think a temper is so bad.

502
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,477
Sometimes when I lose my temper...

503
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:47,022
I think it's just me trying
to tell me something I'm not ready to hear.

504
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,941
That's ridiculous.

505
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,108
Maybe.

506
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:51,777
Hey, there.

507
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,111
Put us down there.

508
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,244
That's not right.

509
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:04,706
Motor oil.

510
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:06,542
Yup, this is the source.

511
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:08,877
Why is there no water?

512
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,420
Because the doors are broken.

513
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:14,174
This is supposed to catch spill over
from those main canals and...

514
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:20,889
Run for your life!

515
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,062
Help!

516
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:31,608
Grab this!

517
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:41,368
Firetown.

518
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:51,295
Catch!

519
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,570
Ember, throw me more!

520
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,168
So, will this hold?

521
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,754
Yup. It should for sure.

522
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:37,633
At least long enough for me
to get a city crew to fix it before Friday.

523
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:39,593
What?

524
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,970
You've got a little sand.

525
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:45,432
Here? Here?

526
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,892
It's right there.

527
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:53,941
Thanks.

528
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:58,278
Well, let me know when it's done, I guess.

529
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,697
I'll make sure there's a city crew
here by Friday.

530
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,408
Okay. See ya.

531
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:04,409
Wait.

532
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,330
Any chance you're free tomorrow?

533
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:12,376
To hang out with a Water guy?

534
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:15,587
With a Water guy?
My dad would boil you alive.

535
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:17,798
He doesn't have to know.
We can meet in the city.

536
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,967
I promise, nothing weird.

537
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,844
Maybe a little pruning?

538
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,138
Sorry, that's not going to happen.

539
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,266
You smiled. I saw it.

540
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:30,894
Tomorrow, I'll be at the Alkali Theater.
3:00!

541
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:33,689
Yeah because then you know with the light...

542
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,441
Your ceiling is dripping again.

543
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:37,484
More leaks?

544
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:40,863
Don't worry.
This whole problem is going away.

545
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,323
I can feel it.

546
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:50,789
And since we're all good,
I am also going away to do deliveries.

547
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:55,460
Do I smell something on Ember?

548
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:58,714
Yo, Ember.

549
00:38:58,881 --> 00:38:59,715
Clod.

550
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:00,966
I grew another one.

551
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,553
My queen.

552
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,514
Oops, sorry, but gotta go.

553
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:24,239
<i>Started out on a one-way train
Always knew where I was gonna go next</i>

554
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:28,869
<i>Didn't know until I saw your face
I was missin' out on every moment</i>

555
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:34,499
<i>You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?</i>

556
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,794
<i>I'm into you</i>

557
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:45,052
<i>So if it's real,
then, darlin', let me know</i>

558
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:55,479
<i>I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show</i>

559
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:08,367
<i>You and I,
we go together</i>

560
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:10,786
<i>You're the sky
I'll be the weather</i>

561
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:13,872
<i>A pretty thing, the sunny rain
who knew?</i>

562
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,250
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

563
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,544
<i>Summer night,
perfect occasion</i>

564
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,797
<i>Where am I?
You know I'll be waitin' for you</i>

565
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,467
<i>Oh, for you</i>

566
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:31,890
<i>So if it's real,
then, darlin', let me know</i>

567
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:40,190
<i>I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show</i>

568
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:41,900
Who is this guy?

569
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,652
<i>Shine</i>

570
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:48,156
<i>You shine, like forever</i>

571
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,367
<i>Lasts forever</i>

572
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:57,749
<i>You shine, you shine,
and steal the show</i>

573
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:08,385
<i>So if it's real
then, darlin', let me know</i>

574
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:18,520
<i>I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show</i>

575
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:22,524
<i>Started out on a one-way train
Always knew where I was gonna go next</i>

576
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:29,198
<i>So if it's real
then, darlin', let me know</i>

577
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:30,365
Whoa.

578
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:32,910
How'd you do that?

579
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,704
It's the minerals.
Check this out.

580
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,166
Awesome.

581
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,968
Wow.
Watch this.

582
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:02,249
Another?

583
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:10,757
No, no, no!

584
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,342
The water is back.

585
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:20,475
Ember Lumen.

586
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,853
Delivery for Ember Lumen.

587
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,314
Flowers for Ember?

588
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:32,279
Excuse me. These are so beautiful.

589
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:33,739
I'm gonna go put these away.

590
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:39,453
What are you doing here?

591
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,247
I got bad news.
The sandbags didn't hold.

592
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:43,415
Obviously.

593
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:46,210
Yeah. And I also got worse news.

594
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:50,631
I'd forgotten a tiny detail
about the last time I saw that city crew.

595
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:53,467
You knocked over three tons of cement dust.

596
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:56,094
Half the guys still haven't recovered.

597
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:00,599
I guess you could say
they still have hard feelings...

598
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:02,351
because they won't help us.

599
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:04,561
Wade, Gale's deadline is tomorrow.

600
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:05,896
We need more sandbags.

601
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,356
But that didn't work before.

602
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:09,107
Well, I can't just do nothing.

603
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:10,943
Ember, did you fix leak?

604
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:13,070
-It's you again.
-Who? Me?

605
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,738
You're the guy who started all this.

606
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:16,823
No, Dad. Different guy.

607
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:18,784
Not all Water looks alike.

608
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,827
You are city inspector?

609
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,413
No.
Right?

610
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,041
Right! I am not an inspector.

611
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:30,170
You are inspector.

612
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,090
Why you poking around?
Is this because of water leak?

613
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:36,343
No. Not because of water in any way.

614
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,012
He's a different kind of inspector.

615
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,013
Right?

616
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,306
Yeah. Yeah.

617
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:44,768
I'm a food inspector.

618
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:47,521
I've come to inspect your food.

619
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,357
I think he's lying through his feet.

620
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,067
-Teeth.
-Whatever.

621
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:53,652
Food upstairs. Come.

622
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,112
Food inspector?

623
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:56,280
I panicked.

624
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:00,659
You really food inspector?

625
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:02,286
As far as you know, yeah.

626
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,372
Then inspect this.

627
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,457
Dad.

628
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:10,794
Yep, all looks good to me.

629
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:14,882
No, no, no.
Inspect with your mouth.

630
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,997
You see? He likes it.

631
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,960
You must try these.
Straight from Fire Land.

632
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:53,587
Dad, those are too hot.

633
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,881
I'm okay.
I love hot food.

634
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,848
Hey! Watch your water.

635
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:06,517
So, did we pass?

636
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:08,810
A plus.

637
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:13,982
Actually, after the heat dies down,
that's really good.

638
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,109
If you don't mind.

639
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:28,622
See? It's really tasty
if you water it down a little.

640
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,332
Water us down?

641
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,042
Water us down?

642
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,377
Where's camera?

643
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:37,214
We will never be watered down by you.
Get out!

644
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:38,757
All right, sir, you gotta go.

645
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:43,095
Dad, don't worry.
I've got this.

646
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:47,850
Look, meet me at the beach
and we'll make more sandbags.

647
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:50,018
We have to figure out
how to fix those doors.

648
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:52,312
Water want to water us down?

649
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:55,649
Then Water no longer allowed in shop.

650
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:57,568
He is panned.

651
00:46:58,318 --> 00:46:59,152
Banned.

652
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:00,320
Banned!

653
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,824
<i>Àshfá,</i> it's okay.

654
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:07,578
It's all going to be okay.

655
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,172
I don't think this is going to work.

656
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,716
Well, it won't
unless you hold the bag straight.

657
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:23,552
Maybe your dad will understand.

658
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:24,720
I'm serious.

659
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:26,722
Look, I know it can be tough.

660
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:30,684
I mean, with my dad,
we were like oil and water.

661
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:32,477
I never got a chance to fix that.

662
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,438
But you guys are different.

663
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:37,649
It might be time to tell him.

664
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:39,735
Yeah, right. And tell him what?

665
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:42,738
That I got us shut down
and destroyed his dream?

666
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:54,416
I think I'm failing.

667
00:47:56,084 --> 00:48:00,005
My <i>Àshfá </i>should have retired years ago,
but he doesn't think I'm ready.

668
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,760
You have no idea how hard they've worked.

669
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,095
Or what they've had to endure.

670
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:09,681
Family they left behind.

671
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:13,268
How do you repay a sacrifice that big?

672
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:15,437
It all feels like a burden.

673
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:17,439
How can I say that?

674
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:19,066
I'm a bad daughter.

675
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:22,361
Hey, no. You're doing your best.

676
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:25,489
I'm a mess.

677
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:28,742
Nah. I think you're even more beautiful.

678
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:44,758
Maybe you're right when you said
my temper is me trying to tell me something.

679
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:50,013
Look what your fire did to the sand.

680
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:52,099
It's glass.

681
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:04,361
It looks like a Vivisteria flower.

682
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,365
I know how to seal those doors.

683
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:29,386
Yes.

684
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:42,816
Are you crying?

685
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,193
Yes.

686
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:47,905
I've just never been punched in the face
with beauty before.

687
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:03,128
It worked!

688
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:04,963
I'll have Gale come by right after work.

689
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,965
I'll let you know the second I hear anything.

690
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,425
You think this will be good enough for her?

691
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:12,137
Honestly, it's hard to know.
She could go either way.

692
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:16,642
Here. I saved this for you.

693
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:19,686
It's special.

694
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,327
<i>Àshfá,</i> you okay?

695
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,580
Yes, yes. Just too much to fix.

696
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:39,873
I'll take care of it.

697
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,334
You need to rest, and that's an order.

698
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:43,794
Yes, ma'am.

699
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,757
Ember, I see a change in you.

700
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:51,677
Happier, calmer with customers...

701
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:55,305
and with that food inspector.

702
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:57,516
Always putting shop first.

703
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,936
You prove I can trust you.

704
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,820
I'm so lucky I have you.

705
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:25,002
Love?

706
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,940
Ember, you found it.
Everything okay?

707
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:49,401
Please tell me that
you have some good news from Gale.

708
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:51,570
I'm getting really worried about my dad.

709
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:52,905
This has to break my way.

710
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:56,408
Yeah, I haven't heard from her yet,
but she swore she'd call tonight.

711
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:58,952
Actually, my family stopped by for dinner.

712
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,121
You want to come up
and wait for the call together?

713
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:02,706
Your family?

714
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,839
Okay. I'll come up for a bit.

715
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:13,884
I'm sorry, you live here?

716
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:14,968
It's my mom's place.

717
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,053
Oh, my gosh!

718
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:22,809
I'm afraid I can't let you in.
Residents and guests only.

719
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:25,854
Okay. I understand.

720
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:31,360
You're surprisingly good at your job.

721
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:33,654
You're surprisingly fast for your age.

722
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,697
You have no idea.

723
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:40,494
Ember! I'm so excited to finally meet you.

724
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:43,288
Do we hug, or wave, or...?

725
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,082
Don't want to put you out.

726
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:46,959
A hello is fine.

727
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:50,671
Hardly. Wade hasn't stopped talking about you
since the day you met.

728
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:52,673
-The boy is smitten.
-Mom.

729
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,468
Oh, come on. I'm your mother.
I know when something's lighting you up.

730
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:59,346
I just didn't know she'd be so smoky.

731
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:05,477
Come this way, meet the rest of the family.

732
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:19,908
Oh, honey, you won't believe
what your baby niece did today.

733
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:21,910
She smiled.

734
00:53:22,077 --> 00:53:23,912
No, she didn't.

735
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:27,541
Yeah.

736
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:31,044
Hey, everyone, this is Ember.

737
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,421
Hey!

738
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:34,756
That's my brother Alan and his wife Eddy.

739
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:35,757
Hi.

740
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:38,093
And we got two kids that are
swimmin' around here somewhere.

741
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,387
Marco! Polo!

742
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:41,805
What?

743
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,557
Hi, Uncle Wade!

744
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:46,435
-Do you die if you fall in water?
-Whoa!

745
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,687
-Marco!
-Kids, right?

746
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:49,855
Don't hate us.

747
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,899
Anyway, that's my little sib, Lake...

748
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:53,734
-and her girlfriend, Ghibli.
-'Sup!

749
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:56,195
They're students at
Element City School for the Arts.

750
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:57,863
Yeah. Following in Mom's wake.

751
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,781
Nonsense. I'm just an architect.

752
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:02,075
The real artist is my brother, Harold.

753
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:04,995
I just dabble in watercolors.

754
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,915
Or as we like to call them, "colors."

755
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:10,626
Don't listen to him.
He's a wonderful painter.

756
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:14,004
One of his paintings just got in the
Element City Museum's permanent collection.

757
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:15,839
Wow, that is so cool.

758
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:18,175
My only talent is "Clean up on aisle four."

759
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:19,426
Talk about being modest.

760
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:21,678
Ember's got an incredible creative flame.

761
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:23,180
I've never seen anything like it.

762
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:27,809
I just have to say that
you speak so well and clear.

763
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,562
Yeah, it's amazing...

764
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,357
what talking in the same language
your entire life can do.

765
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:34,858
Hey, Ember...

766
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:38,737
did Wadey here ever tell you that
he's deathly afraid of sponges?

767
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:39,738
No.

768
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:41,615
<i>I was traumatized.</i>

769
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,210
I still can't use a sponge around him.

770
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,254
I was stuck in there for hours.

771
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:58,340
Alan! That was new.

772
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:00,968
My bad. I'm all whirlpools tonight.

773
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:01,969
I can fix it.

774
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:25,284
Sorry.

775
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:28,287
That was incredible!

776
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:30,956
It's just melted glass.

777
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:32,374
"Just melted glass"?

778
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:36,003
Every building in the new city
is built from just "melted glass".

779
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,213
Oh, no, you have to do something
with that talent.

780
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,217
See, I told you, you're special.

781
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:47,556
Thought bubble.

782
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:50,976
Maybe after dinner we play The Crying Game?

783
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,394
Yes, yes, yes.

784
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:54,855
Let me guess, you try to cry?

785
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:57,149
We try not to cry.

786
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,318
You have one minute. Go!

787
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,406
1979. November. You were...

788
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:10,829
Never got a chance to say goodbye to Nana.

789
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:13,874
Damn, you're good.

790
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,376
Okay, Ember, Wade, you're up.

791
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:22,508
Yeah, this is almost unfair
because I have literally never cried.

792
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,051
You got no chance.

793
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:26,386
Sounds like a challenge.

794
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:28,055
Ready, go!

795
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:30,849
Butterfly, windshield wipers...

796
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:32,935
half a butterfly.

797
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:38,982
Okay.

798
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:43,320
An old man on his deathbed
remembers the summer he fell in love.

799
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:46,365
She was out of his league
and he was young and scared.

800
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,285
He let her go, thinking surely
summer would come again.

801
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:53,330
It never did.

802
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:56,667
Almost out of time.

803
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:00,796
Ember...

804
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:04,508
when I met you I thought I was drowning.

805
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:07,302
But that light...

806
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:11,515
that light inside you
has made me feel so alive.

807
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:16,186
And all I want now is to be near it.

808
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:18,564
Near you.

809
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:20,315
<i>Together.</i>

810
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,222
Hello? Gale, hi.

811
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:55,017
Glass? You repaired it with glass?

812
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:56,059
Hold the storm.

813
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:01,773
Tempered glass. Solid as a rock, I like it.

814
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,234
Consider the tickets cancelled.

815
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,613
-We did it?
-Yup!

816
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:10,657
Awesome!

817
00:58:15,913 --> 00:58:17,331
Thank you, Mrs. Ripple.

818
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:18,957
This was...

819
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:20,792
This was really great.

820
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:21,960
Yeah, it was.

821
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:24,463
And I mean what I said about your talent.

822
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:28,008
I have a friend who runs
the best glassmaking firm in the world.

823
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:30,427
During dinner,
I slipped out and I made a call...

824
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:32,721
and I told her about you.

825
00:58:32,888 --> 00:58:34,097
They're looking for an intern.

826
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:36,475
It could be an amazing opportunity.

827
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:37,601
For real?

828
00:58:37,768 --> 00:58:40,562
It's a long way from the city,
but it would be an incredible start.

829
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:42,773
You have a bright future.

830
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:46,151
Look at me, I have an original Ember.

831
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:49,821
Hold up, I'll walk you out.

832
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:54,368
I'm afraid you're still
going to have to...

833
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:55,452
wait out here, ma'am.

834
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,037
And I'm afraid...

835
00:58:58,121 --> 00:58:59,540
I will throw up.

836
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:08,590
Ember.

837
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:09,967
Ember, hold up, what's going on?

838
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:12,052
I can't believe
she basically offered me a job.

839
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,012
I know! Could be cool.

840
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:15,264
Yeah, super cool, Wade.

841
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,392
I could move out and make glass
in a faraway city. Do whatever I want.

842
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:20,727
-I don't understand.
-I'm going home.

843
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:22,271
Fine, then I'm going with you.

844
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:26,984
A Water guy?

845
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,700
Look, my mom was just trying to be helpful.

846
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:37,327
She doesn't know
how excited you are to run the shop.

847
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:39,997
-What is the matter?
-Nothing!

848
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:42,291
Yeah? 'Cause we're going, like, a thousand...

849
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:43,458
Bus!

850
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:48,964
You don't know me, Wade. Okay?

851
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:50,674
So stop pretending like you do.

852
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:51,967
What is this about?

853
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:53,010
Nothing.

854
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,762
Everything. I don't know. It's...

855
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:04,229
I don't think I actually
do want to run the shop. Okay?

856
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:09,151
That's what my temper
has been trying to tell me.

857
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:12,738
I'm trapped.

858
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:17,367
You know what's crazy?

859
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:20,412
Even when I was a kid,
I would pray to the Blue Flame...

860
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:23,373
to be good enough
to fill my father's shoes someday...

861
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,584
because this place is his dream.

862
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:28,462
But I never once asked...

863
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:31,798
what I wanted to do.

864
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:39,306
I think that's because deep down,
I knew it didn't matter.

865
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:44,561
Because the only way
to repay a sacrifice so big...

866
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:48,148
is by sacrificing your life too.

867
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,568
Ember!

868
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,320
Don't move.

869
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,613
Oh, blaze! My mother.

870
01:01:03,205 --> 01:01:05,249
Mom, it's okay.
He's just a friend.

871
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:08,460
Silence!

872
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:12,214
I could smell you from over there.
You stink.

873
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:13,590
What are you talking about?

874
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:16,802
You know what I'm talking about.

875
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:20,681
You're smelling love on me?

876
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:24,059
If your father find out...

877
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:27,980
Fire and Water cannot be together.

878
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:30,732
I prove it. Come with me.

879
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:35,821
I splash this on your heart
to bring love to the surface.

880
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:46,373
And then you must light these with your fire,
and I read the smoke.

881
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:01,138
See, Ember? It cannot be.

882
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:05,934
Actually...

883
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:09,104
What are you doing?

884
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:43,430
Cinder?

885
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:44,431
Who down there?

886
01:02:44,598 --> 01:02:46,225
It's my dad.
You have to go.

887
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,728
Wait, are we a match?

888
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:52,773
What's going on?
I wake up and nobody upstairs.

889
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,982
It was just me.

890
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:57,694
I was double-checking the locks.

891
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,821
And Mom came down and...

892
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:04,034
Yes, and we began looking at this door.

893
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:05,911
We don't talk about this door enough.

894
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:07,079
Pull it together.

895
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:08,872
Well, since you're awake...

896
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:13,794
I was gonna tell you tomorrow,
but I'm too excited to sleep.

897
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:16,463
In two days, I retire.

898
01:03:17,172 --> 01:03:18,048
Oh, Bernie.

899
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:19,174
Two days?

900
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:22,052
Yes. We're going to throw big party.

901
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:23,595
A grand reopening.

902
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:27,641
That way I can tell whole world
my daughter take over.

903
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,353
And I have gift for you.

904
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,356
I've had this for a while,
but after our talk...

905
01:03:34,523 --> 01:03:36,483
I know now is the time.

906
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:38,694
Before I give it to you...

907
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:42,364
I need you to understand what it means to me.

908
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,200
<i>When I left Fire Land...</i>

909
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:50,414
<i>I gave my father the </i>Bà Ksô...

910
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:52,875
<i>the big bow.</i>

911
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:57,880
<i>It is the highest form of respect.</i>

912
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:03,468
<i>But my father...</i>

913
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,471
<i>did not return the bow.</i>

914
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:09,892
<i>Did not give me his blessing.</i>

915
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,145
<i>He say, if we leave Fire Land...</i>

916
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:15,856
<i>we will lose who we are.</i>

917
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:19,985
They never got to see all of this.

918
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:24,948
They didn't get to see
that I never forgot we are Fire.

919
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:28,535
This is burden I still carry.

920
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:31,288
Ember, it is important that you know...

921
01:04:31,455 --> 01:04:35,417
you have my blessing
every day you come in here.

922
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:37,085
So I have this made for you.

923
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:40,672
Wow, <i>Àshfá.</i>

924
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:44,343
It's gonna be big, bright.

925
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,178
Everyone's gonna see this.

926
01:04:46,345 --> 01:04:48,347
"Ember's Fireplace."

927
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:50,891
We unveil it at grand reopening.

928
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:55,562
Come, Bernie.
You need your rest.

929
01:05:20,504 --> 01:05:23,799
Ember, so, what'd your mom say
about our reading?

930
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:25,133
Nothing.

931
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,885
Look, I have a gift for you.

932
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:33,934
And you came all the way here
to give it to me?

933
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:35,936
Wait, why are you giving me gifts?

934
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:38,355
Oh, no.

935
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:40,232
No, no, no.

936
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:42,359
Hold on, I think I have
something to show you.

937
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:43,819
Just give me two seconds.

938
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:45,571
And you're gonna need a pair of boots.

939
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:51,451
Wade, what are we doing here?

940
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,828
Just wait.

941
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:02,713
Why do they even have these?

942
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:03,714
Who knows?

943
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:13,432
Hey, it's my favorite fireball.

944
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,767
Hey, Gale. What's going on?

945
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,478
I know you think you have to end this...

946
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:21,815
but that flooded tunnel,
it goes to the main terminal.

947
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:23,192
Okay.

948
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,444
Do you still want to see a Vivisteria?

949
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:27,738
Gale?

950
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:38,999
Wait, I'm supposed to get in there?

951
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,209
The air should last...

952
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,960
At least 20 minutes.

953
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:46,256
They said you couldn't go in there.

954
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:49,593
Why does anyone get to tell you
what you can do in your life?

955
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:18,205
Whoa.

956
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,993
A Vivisteria.

957
01:08:56,761 --> 01:08:57,763
Whoa.

958
01:09:26,124 --> 01:09:27,709
-Ouch.
-Hey, you're running out of air.

959
01:09:37,426 --> 01:09:40,471
Almost there.
Try to breathe slow and steady.

960
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:54,611
I'm so sorry. I should never...

961
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:55,737
Are you kidding?

962
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:59,074
That was amazing!
I finally saw a Vivisteria!

963
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:02,202
It was inspiring.

964
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:03,579
You were inspiring.

965
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:09,877
No. Wade, we can't touch.

966
01:10:10,043 --> 01:10:11,295
Maybe we can.

967
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:12,713
No.

968
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:14,882
But can't we just prove it?

969
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:15,924
Prove what?

970
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:17,426
Let's see what happens...

971
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:20,304
and if it's a disaster,
then we'll know this would never work.

972
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:22,764
But it actually could be a disaster.

973
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:26,518
I could vaporize you.
You could extinguish me, and then...

974
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:29,271
Let's start small.

975
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:09,997
I'm so lucky.

976
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:16,795
I'm so lucky I have you.

977
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:24,720
I have to go.

978
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,848
Wait, what?

979
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,057
Where are you going?

980
01:12:29,141 --> 01:12:31,018
Back to my life at the shop where I belong.

981
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:32,186
I take over tomorrow.

982
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:33,645
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

983
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:36,190
You don't want that, you said so yourself.

984
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:37,691
It doesn't matter what I want.

985
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:39,359
Of course it does.

986
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:40,736
Listen. Listen.

987
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:43,655
You've got an opportunity
to do something you want with your life.

988
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:45,032
"Want"?

989
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:48,076
Yeah, that may work in your rich kid,
"follow your heart" family...

990
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:50,621
but getting to do what you want
is a luxury...

991
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:52,372
and not for people like me.

992
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:55,334
Why not?
Just tell your father how you feel.

993
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:57,503
This is too important.
Maybe he'll agree.

994
01:12:58,754 --> 01:12:59,588
Yeah.

995
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:01,840
Funny.

996
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:04,801
And this whole time
I thought you were so strong...

997
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,888
but turns out you're just afraid.

998
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:10,724
Don't you dare judge me.

999
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:12,059
You don't know what it's like...

1000
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:14,478
to have parents who gave up
everything for you.

1001
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:17,940
I'm Fire, Wade.

1002
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:19,691
I can't be anything more than that.

1003
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:21,902
It's what I am and what my family is.

1004
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:23,570
It's our way of life.

1005
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:27,074
I cannot throw all of that away just for you.

1006
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:30,077
I don't understand.

1007
01:13:30,494 --> 01:13:33,914
And that alone is a reason
this could never work.

1008
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:36,124
It's over, Wade.

1009
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,241
Everyone, welcome.

1010
01:14:09,408 --> 01:14:11,869
It is good to see your faces.

1011
01:14:12,035 --> 01:14:15,247
I am honored to have served you...

1012
01:14:15,414 --> 01:14:17,291
but it's time to move on.

1013
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,168
Come.

1014
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,171
My daughter...

1015
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,673
you are the Ember of our family fire.

1016
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:31,680
That is why I am so proud
to have you take over my life's work.

1017
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:44,568
Pretty good trick, huh?

1018
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:49,907
This is lantern I bring from old country.

1019
01:14:50,991 --> 01:14:53,744
Today, I pass it on to you.

1020
01:15:04,129 --> 01:15:05,506
I thought of other reasons.

1021
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:11,720
Wade?

1022
01:15:13,096 --> 01:15:13,931
Oh, boy.

1023
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:15,516
What are you doing here?

1024
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:18,519
You said me not understanding
is the reason we can never work.

1025
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:21,313
But I thought of other reasons.
A bunch of 'em.

1026
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,441
Like, number one, you're Fire, I'm Water.

1027
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:26,318
I mean, come on, that's crazy.

1028
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:27,694
Right?

1029
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:29,988
-Who is this?
-No idea.

1030
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:32,157
Number two, I'm crashing your party.

1031
01:15:32,324 --> 01:15:33,909
Like, what kind of a jerk am I?

1032
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:35,786
-A pretty big one.
-Right?

1033
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:40,290
Number three,
I can't eat your delicious foods.

1034
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:43,961
Very unpleasant.

1035
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:47,047
Wait, I know him.
He is food inspector.

1036
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:50,801
Oh, right. Number four,
I'm banned from your father's shop.

1037
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:54,596
There are a million reasons
why this can't work.

1038
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,056
A million nos.

1039
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:58,433
But there's also one yes...

1040
01:15:58,725 --> 01:15:59,560
we touched.

1041
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:02,646
And when we did, something happened to us...

1042
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:03,856
something impossible.

1043
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:07,150
We changed each other's chemistry.

1044
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:08,443
Enough!

1045
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:10,821
What kind of food inspection is this?

1046
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:12,823
A food inspection of the heart, sir.

1047
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:13,949
Who are you?

1048
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:17,661
Just a guy who burst into your
daughter's life in a flooded old basement.

1049
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:19,830
So you are the one who burst the pipes?

1050
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:21,415
What? Not me. It was...

1051
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:24,126
You?

1052
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:26,461
You burst the pipe?

1053
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:27,629
-I...
-Ember.

1054
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:29,298
-Silence!
-No!

1055
01:16:29,464 --> 01:16:30,716
Take the chance.

1056
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:32,801
Let your father know who you really are.

1057
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:37,556
Look, I had regrets when my dad died.

1058
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:41,768
But because of you, I learned
to embrace the light while it burns.

1059
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:43,061
<i>Tìshók.</i>

1060
01:16:43,896 --> 01:16:46,481
You don't have forever
to say what you need to say.

1061
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:49,526
I love you, Ember Lumen.

1062
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:55,157
And I'm pretty sure you love me too.

1063
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:01,288
No, Wade, I don't.

1064
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,877
That's not true.
I did their reading.

1065
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:10,589
Bernie, it's love.
It's true love.

1066
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:12,549
No, Mom, you're wrong.

1067
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:13,675
Wade, go.

1068
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:14,760
But, Ember...

1069
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:16,512
I don't love you.

1070
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:19,556
Go!

1071
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:37,115
You have been seeing Water?

1072
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:38,325
<i>Àshfá</i>, I...

1073
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:40,285
You caused leak in shop?

1074
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:43,455
I trusted you.

1075
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:46,959
You will not take over the shop.

1076
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:50,629
I no longer retire.

1077
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:43,140
Why can't I just be a good daughter?

1078
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:20,302
Firetown.

1079
01:19:24,223 --> 01:19:26,225
Well, one-way ticket to anywhere but here.

1080
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:28,143
Go. Travel the world.

1081
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,229
Heal that broken heart.

1082
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:33,565
My little drip, drip baby boy.

1083
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:38,695
<i>Drip, drip, drip, goes the baby boy</i>

1084
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,156
I made you a painting.

1085
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:43,450
It's of a lonely man...

1086
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:45,244
awash in sadness.

1087
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:52,751
Ember.

1088
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:01,510
Mom, Dad!

1089
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:22,239
Water's coming!

1090
01:20:23,156 --> 01:20:24,241
Watch out!

1091
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:25,409
Behind you!

1092
01:20:26,326 --> 01:20:27,578
Climb! Climb!

1093
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:29,621
Flash flood! Hurry!

1094
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:31,415
Mom, water!

1095
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:32,666
Get to higher ground!

1096
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,126
Bernie!

1097
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:49,433
The flame!

1098
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,684
Let me go!

1099
01:20:54,188 --> 01:20:55,189
Ember, no!

1100
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,752
-Wade?
-Keyhole.

1101
01:21:22,466 --> 01:21:24,551
I was hoping to make a more heroic entrance.

1102
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:27,137
You came back, after everything I said.

1103
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:28,972
Are you kidding? And miss all this?

1104
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:33,435
Hold the door.

1105
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:48,617
No! No.

1106
01:21:48,784 --> 01:21:49,701
No, no, no.

1107
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:57,334
Ember, we have to go!

1108
01:21:57,835 --> 01:21:59,211
We have to go now!

1109
01:21:59,378 --> 01:22:00,546
I can't leave.

1110
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:04,341
I'm sorry to say this, but the shop is done.
The flame is done.

1111
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:08,178
No! This is my father's whole life.
I'm not going anywhere.

1112
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:15,561
Throw me that lantern.

1113
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:26,864
No.

1114
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:31,076
No, no, no.

1115
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:34,121
Oh, Wade.

1116
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:35,706
Thank you, thank you.

1117
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:00,772
It's too hot in here.

1118
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:04,234
Climb!

1119
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:14,244
Back up! Back up!

1120
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:29,843
-I have to open that up.
-No!

1121
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:32,262
The water will come in
and you'll be snuffed out.

1122
01:23:32,429 --> 01:23:35,432
But you're evaporating.
I don't know what to do.

1123
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:36,725
It's okay.

1124
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:38,477
No, it's not okay!

1125
01:23:47,611 --> 01:23:48,445
Ember...

1126
01:23:48,862 --> 01:23:50,405
I have no regrets.

1127
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:53,116
You gave me something
people search for their whole lives.

1128
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:56,203
But I can't exist in a world without you.

1129
01:23:57,913 --> 01:23:59,998
I'm sorry I didn't say it before.

1130
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:03,085
I love you, Wade.

1131
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:13,762
I really do love it
when your light does that.

1132
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:32,573
They're in the hearth!

1133
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,749
Wade is gone.

1134
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,169
Oh, my daughter.

1135
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:47,421
He saved me.

1136
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:02,853
Dad...

1137
01:25:04,188 --> 01:25:06,064
this is all my fault.

1138
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:08,817
The shop...

1139
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:11,987
Wade.

1140
01:25:15,991 --> 01:25:18,368
I need to tell you the truth.

1141
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:21,330
I don't want to run the shop.

1142
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:26,293
I know that was your dream,
but it's not mine.

1143
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:28,921
I'm sorry.

1144
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:31,798
I'm a bad daughter.

1145
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:42,684
Ember...

1146
01:25:42,976 --> 01:25:45,604
the shop was never the dream.

1147
01:25:45,771 --> 01:25:47,981
You were the dream.

1148
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:50,609
You were always the dream.

1149
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:00,244
I loved him, Dad.

1150
01:26:32,234 --> 01:26:33,652
Butterfly.

1151
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:40,492
Butterfly. Windshield wipers.
Half a butterfly.

1152
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,879
An old man on his deathbed
remembers the summer he fell in love.

1153
01:26:58,594 --> 01:27:00,429
She was out of his league...

1154
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:03,390
and he was young and scared.

1155
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:06,935
He let her go, thinking surely
summer would come again.

1156
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:08,729
It never did.

1157
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:15,777
You are perfect match. Ten out of ten.

1158
01:27:18,572 --> 01:27:20,282
I don't understand.
What's going on?

1159
01:27:20,449 --> 01:27:23,160
Just say something
to make Water guy cry, okay?

1160
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:27,372
You are no longer panned.

1161
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:29,208
Banned.

1162
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:30,292
Banned.

1163
01:27:32,294 --> 01:27:35,589
I want to explore the world with you,
Wade Ripple.

1164
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:38,258
I want to have you with me in my life.

1165
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:39,468
Forever.

1166
01:27:54,483 --> 01:27:57,444
Your chimney needs cleaning.

1167
01:28:20,509 --> 01:28:24,429
I knew it. My nose always knows.

1168
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:41,530
If you were a vegetable,
you'd be a cute-cumber.

1169
01:28:42,698 --> 01:28:44,116
My queen.

1170
01:28:45,409 --> 01:28:48,662
I can't believe I was gonna
shut this place down.

1171
01:28:49,705 --> 01:28:50,706
Sorry.

1172
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:54,209
Fern, you're a Windbreakers fan?

1173
01:28:54,543 --> 01:28:55,627
Toot toot.

1174
01:28:56,086 --> 01:28:58,130
Toot toot.

1175
01:28:58,297 --> 01:29:01,091
Oy, you know what I like best
about running this shop?

1176
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:03,844
Not having to eat Bernie's kol-nuts?

1177
01:29:04,887 --> 01:29:09,349
Sorry, I couldn't hear you
through my retirement.

1178
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:36,084
Hey!

1179
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:38,045
-Hi, Wade.
-Hey, Wade! Yo, yo, yo!

1180
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:41,548
Ember, it's time.

1181
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,057
You know, I'm not really
one for tearful goodbyes.

1182
01:29:50,807 --> 01:29:51,642
Wade.

1183
01:29:52,309 --> 01:29:54,311
You big liar.

1184
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:57,439
<i>Drip, drip, drip</i>

1185
01:29:57,606 --> 01:29:59,775
<i>Goes the baby boy</i>

1186
01:30:04,655 --> 01:30:06,490
Are you sure about this one?

1187
01:30:06,657 --> 01:30:07,741
I'm sure.

1188
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:09,451
Dad...

1189
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:12,329
I'm sorry the internship is so far away.

1190
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:14,957
I mean, it's the best glass design company
in the world...

1191
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:16,750
but who knows if it'll become a real job.

1192
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:18,085
I'll be back in a few months anyway...

1193
01:30:18,252 --> 01:30:19,628
and it might not end up being anything...

1194
01:30:20,838 --> 01:30:22,381
Go, start new life.

1195
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:24,383
Your mother and I will be here.

1196
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,969
Now, with more time for hanky-panky.

1197
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:54,598
<i>Started out on a one-way train
Always knew where I was gonna go next</i>

1198
01:31:54,765 --> 01:31:59,811
<i>Didn't know until I saw your face
I was missin' out on every moment</i>

1199
01:31:59,978 --> 01:32:05,442
<i>You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?</i>

1200
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:08,403
<i>I'm into you</i>

1201
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:15,369
<i>So if it's real,
then, darlin', let me know</i>

1202
01:32:19,498 --> 01:32:25,754
<i>I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show</i>

1203
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:51,613
<i>You and I, we go together
You're the sky, I'll be the weather</i>

1204
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:55,117
<i>A pretty thing, the sun and rain
Who knew?</i>

1205
01:32:55,284 --> 01:32:56,869
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1206
01:32:57,035 --> 01:33:03,125
<i>Summer night, perfect occasion
Where am I? You know I'll be waitin' for you</i>

1207
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:06,253
<i>Oh, for you</i>

1208
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:10,549
<i>So if it's real, then, darlin'</i>

1209
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:12,509

01:33:43,248 --> 01:33:45,626
<i>You shine</i>

1214
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:50,464
<i>You shine, like forever</i>

1215
01:33:50,631 --> 01:33:51,840
<i>Lasts forever</i>

1216
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:59,306
<i>You shine, you shine,
and steal the show</i>

1217
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:09,566
<i>So if it's real,
