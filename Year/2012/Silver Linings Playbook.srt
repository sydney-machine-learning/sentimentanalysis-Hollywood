1
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:20,028
What, are you kidding me? Sundays?
I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,782
The whole family's together. Mom
makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on.

3
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:27,184
We're all watching the game.
Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes,

4
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,541
I was negative. You didn't even know
that I loved it, Nikki, but I did.

5
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,963
I just didn't appreciate
it, or you, before. "

6
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:35,581
Come on. Time to go.

7
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:42,307
I lost all that. I blew it. But you
also blew it. We can get it back.

8
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,711
We're gonna get it back.
It's all gonna be better now.

9
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:48,975
I'm better now and I hope you are,
too. And I'm gonna appreciate... "

10
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:50,424
Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay?

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,127
Doctor's waiting. Let's go.

12
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:54,313
I'll be there in a minute.

13
00:00:57,248 --> 00:00:59,077
That's true love.

14
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:33,755
Yeah, that's when I had long hair.
People say I talk about my hair too much.

15
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,744
And it was just the way I wanted
it, but he cut it back too far.

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,407
He cut this side back too far trying to
even it up. I didn't tell him to do that.

17
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,783
I said, "Just cut it
the way you cut it... "

18
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:42,985
Once you get in the right frame of
mind, I think anything's possible.

19
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:46,759
I think we get, we so often get
caught in this state of negativity and

20
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:48,709
it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.

21
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,658
...technically, you can take him
out against our recommendation,

22
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:08,412
but you assume a lot of liability
in the eyes of the court.

23
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:10,688
And he's just getting
used to the routine here.

24
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:13,743
I don't want him to get
used to the routine here.

25
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:16,911
Eight months is already long enough.

26
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:32,736
Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny
a ride to North Philly?

27
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:36,712
What? I don't understand.

28
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:38,733
Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

29
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:40,916
I guess everybody's leaving today!

30
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:46,858
Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally
meet you. Pat told me all about you,

31
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:50,038
how God made you rich in character,
and you're the mighty oak that holds

32
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,370
the household together, and not to
mention the lasagna you make on game day

33
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:54,340
when the Birds play.

34
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:05,037
Danny was in for assault because
of crystal meth and alcohol.

35
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,355
Bad combination.

36
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,341
Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.
That was when I was an X-ray

37
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:14,224
technician with my ADD and my
anxiety. I had a lot of access to

38
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:18,531
medication and I took advantage of
it. That's when my hair was long, too.

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,106
But my hair only grew when I
was older. When I was younger, my

40
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:22,842
hair didn't grow because my brother...

41
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,165
Remember I told you about my
brother, he had a Jheri curl, and

42
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,545
I couldn't get a Jheri curl because
my hair didn't grow long enough.

43
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:29,460
I was so jealous of my brother...

44
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,421
But Wait a minute, Wait a minute. Hello?

45
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,731
Yeah! It looks great now. You like it?

46
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,987
No, It's good now. Yes, it is.

47
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,787
Wait, you're going the wrong way!

48
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:41,882
What? Are you sure about that?
I'll bring him back right away.

49
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,804
You lied to me, Pat.
Danny's not allowed to leave.

50
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:47,487
All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.

51
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:49,154
Let's just talk about this.

52
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,303
Mom, just listen... Don't tou
-...

53
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,708
...
- ch the steering... ... wheel!

54
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:59,199
Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.

55
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:02,215
I'm sorry, Mom. You okay?

56
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:05,516
I am out on a limb for you
with the courts right now.

57
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:09,095
It's my fault. Pat didn't know.
Pat didn't know. He's my friend,

58
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:12,697
so he was rootin' for me. I'm havin'
a disagreement with the hospital,

59
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,406
but we're working it out.
Take me back to the hospital,

60
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,657
but take Pat home, he's
fine. Trust me. You'll see,

61
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,883
he's fine. It's my fault.

62
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:26,534
Mom, can we stop at the library? I wanna read
Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.

63
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:30,636
Mom, it's a good thing.
I'm remaking myself.

64
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:47,231
DeSean Jackson. What
happened to DeSean Jackson?

65
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:49,359
Come on, tell me that one.

66
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:54,178
It's insanity. He spikes the ball at the
one yard line. The one fucking-yard line.

67
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,086
I mean, get into the end zone, dummy. #
I mean, he celebrates before he's even in!

68
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:03,172
You know something? It's nothing
new. Your team does that all the time.

69
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:06,112
They get close... and then they blow
it. They got an inferiority complex.

70
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:10,502
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
What makes the Cowboys America's Team?

71
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,854
Because we are, we're America's Team.

72
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:14,437
You should be ashamed of
yourself. We're in Philadelphia,

73
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:15,839
what's the matter with you?
You're a fucking traitor.

74
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,324
What's more American than a cowboy?

75
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,703
You know what's more American? What?

76
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:21,618
Benjamin Franklin, that's
what's more American.

77
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,611
Benjamin Franklin?

78
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:25,387
Benjamin Franklin. The founder of
our country, here in Philadelphia.

79
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,306
You mean the guy with the... ... little
glasses and the long scraggly hair?

80
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:30,107
What about the lightning with the
kite? He stood in the storm with a kite.

81
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,838
If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill,
nobody... ... would even know who he is.

82
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:36,281
What are you doing? No, no, no, no.
Don't touch them, don't touch them.

83
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:38,266
I didn't even touch 'em. Why
are you..., don't blame me.

84
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:40,106
Who did this? Who took,
who took, who took the...

85
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,826
the remotes like this?
Did you do this, Randy?

86
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:47,508
No, I don't touch them. As a matter of
fact, I don't know why you need so many.

87
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:51,392
Hey, there she is! Look how beautiful!

88
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:53,422
What! Whats this?

89
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,876
Everything good? Mm-hmm.

90
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,923
Ahh.

91
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:11,692
Where is it? It's right here.

92
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:15,446
You got it. Ahh, well, we got that.
We don't want them to steal that.

93
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,015
You still got yours? Yeah, I got mine.

94
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,457
So what, you don't talk to me? You
didn't tell me you took him out.

95
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,302
Well, he's ready. Look at him.

96
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:25,943
You didn't tell Dad
you were picking me up?

97
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:28,345
Don't worry about that. I wanna
make sure when you come out

98
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:31,083
that you're okay, and
she didn't say anything.

99
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,432
You didn't tell me? The
court said yes. Don't worry.

100
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:38,432
Yeah, but what did the doctor say? Because
the, the court listens to the doctor.

101
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, and the court said- The court
listens to the doctor, the doctor-

102
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:44,742
Dad, relax. The court said
it's fine, okay? Let it go.

103
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:46,355
Don't worry.

104
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:49,772
Dad, I'm in there because of the court.
That's the agreement that we made months ago.

105
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,702
It was a plea bargain with the courts.

106
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,405
The lawyer, he instructed me, he said
that what we should plead that, and

107
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,933
then I would serve eight
months and then I'd get out.

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,001
It's all under control.

109
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:03,962
Well... okay, okay. Congratulations.

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,782
Thank you. So what are
you doing with yourself?

111
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:09,792
You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant.
It's gonna be a cheesesteak place.

112
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:10,962
How you gonna pay for it?

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,615
I'm gonna pay for it,
don't worry about it.

114
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,420
From your bookmaking?

115
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:17,026
Who told you that? Mom told me. Outside.

116
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:18,431
I did not. No, I didn't.

117
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:19,208
You just told me outside, Mom,
what are you talking about?

118
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,148
Five minutes ago, we were walking up the
stairs, you said, "Don't say anything,

119
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,762
but Dad lost his job
and he's bookmaking. "

120
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:31,034
Why, Dolores? Why did you say
that to him? He has the wrong idea.

121
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:34,937
Everything's fine, Patrick. I'm more
concerned about you than anything else.

122
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:35,817
Good, Dad. Good.

123
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:38,645
Okay, the question, the big question,
is what are you gonna do with yourself?

124
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:42,705
What am I gonna do? I'm getting
in shape, I'm getting trim,

125
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,742
I'm getting really fit for Nikki.
I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching

126
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,897
syllabus and get my old job back.

127
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:57,133
Nikki sold the house. She left.
Didn't your mother tell you that?

128
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:59,603
Let me tell you something. You don't know
anything about my marriage, okay, Dad?

129
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,817
All right? Our marriage...
we're very, very much in love,

130
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,649
okay? Just like you two.

131
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:12,194
Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's
not around anymore. Nikki left.

132
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:17,429
What are you doing, Dad? You know what?
Excelsior. Excelsior. What does that mean?

133
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,102
It means you know what I'm
gonna do, I'm gonna take all this

134
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:22,113
negativity and use it as fuel and
I'm gonna find a silver lining,

135
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:23,906
that's what I'm gonna do.
And that's no bullshit.

136
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,504
That's no bullshit. That takes
work and that's the truth.

137
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:04,367
What the fuck?!

138
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:09,144
Stupid fucking book!

139
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,022
I just can't believe Nikki's
teaching that book to the kids.

140
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:14,540
I mean the whole time
- let me just break it down for you

141
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,502
- the whole time you're rooting for
this Hemingway guy to survive the war

142
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:20,076
and to be with the woman that
he loves, Catherine Barkley...

143
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:22,653
It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat.

144
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,140
...and he does. He does. He
survives the war, after getting

145
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:29,298
blown up he survives it, and
he escapes to Switzerland with

146
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:32,806
Catherine. But now Catherine's
pregnant. Isn't that wonderful?

147
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,147
She's pregnant. And they escape
up into the mountains and they're

148
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:37,948
gonna be happy, and they're gonna
be drinking wine and they dance...

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,027
they both like to dance with
each other, there's scenes of them

150
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:42,930
dancing, which was boring, but I
liked it, because they were happy.

151
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:46,942
You think he ends it there?
No! He writes another ending.

152
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:51,017
She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard

153
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:54,061
enough as it is, guys. It's
fucking hard enough as it is.

154
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,202
Can't somebody say,
"Hey, let's be positive?

155
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:59,260
Let's have a good ending to the story?"

156
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:03,853
Pat, you owe us an apology.

157
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:05,156
Mom, for what, I can't apologize.

158
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,869
I'm not gonna apologize for this.

159
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:09,837
You know what I will do? I
will apologize on behalf of

160
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:11,861
Ernest Hemingway, because
that's who's to blame here.

161
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:16,331
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway
call us and apologize to us, too.

162
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,833
Why didn't you run with me? Huh!

163
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,192
I was reading.

164
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:32,189
Please. Do us a favor,
don't read for a while.

165
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,647
What are you wearing a garbage
bag for? I'm gonna go run now.

166
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:38,152
Wait, wait, wait. You
have to fix this window.

167
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,736
I'll fix it when I get back. Fix it now.

168
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:43,047
Get in the car, Pat. You
have to go to therapy.

169
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:44,067
I don't wanna go to therapy.

170
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,247
You have to go. It's part of the deal.
You can't live with us and not go.

171
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:19,181
Is that song really playing?

172
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,350
We have music sometimes.

173
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:25,974
That song is killing me.
Could you please turn it off?

174
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:26,952
I can't.

175
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:28,449
What do you mean, you can't?

176
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,122
I don't have the
controls. I'm sorry, I-

177
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:32,309
Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this?

178
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:34,916
Is there a speaker here?

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,084
Is, is the speaker here?

180
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay... I'm sorry.

181
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:45,824
I'll fix all this, okay?

182
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:55,236
That was a messed up thing
you did, Doctor Patel. Alright!

183
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,275
That's a messed up thing.
I'm sorry, but that's...

184
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:58,584
You can call me Cliff, please.

185
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,184
Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way
you're supposed to meet people, okay?

186
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,686
You should write that
down in your, I don't know

187
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,182
your little book you
write stuff down in.

188
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,307
I'm sorry about that song. I just wanted
to see if it was still a trigger for you.

189
00:12:08,372 --> 00:12:15,205
Bravo. It's a trigger. I'm
not gonna take any meds,

190
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,046
I should just tell you that right now.

191
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:16,935
No, You have to take medicine.

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,337
No, I'm not gonna take any
medicine. It makes me foggy-

193
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:20,026
No, you will have to take medication.

194
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,367
I don't want any meds, Doctor.

195
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:28,502
Look, I am not the explosion guy,
okay? My father is the explosion guy.

196
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm not that guy.

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,031
He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many
people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list.

198
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:38,779
I had one incident. One
incident can change a lifetime.

199
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:46,653
But I'm ready. I'm ready to take
responsibility for my side of the street.

200
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,060
She just needs to take
responsibility for hers.

201
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:49,076
What's hers?

202
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:56,735
What's hers? Are you joking?
Let's go back to the incident.

203
00:12:58,002 --> 00:12:59,267
I come home from work after I..

204
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,406
fight with Nancy, the
high school ... principal.

205
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,086
I come home and what's playing
but the song from my wedding.

206
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:09,320
The song that you so charmingly
played out here today for us.

207
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:12,097
That's playing and I don't think
anything of it. Which is odd,

208
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,069
'cause I should have.

209
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:17,187
I come home, what do I see? I walk
in the door and I see underwear and

210
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,319
pieces of clothing and a guy's
pants with his belt in it,

211
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,054
and I walk up the stairs, and all...

212
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,791
...ll of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the D
-...

213
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:24,491
...
- VD player is the CD and it's playing our wedding song,

214
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:26,212
and then I look down
and I see my wife's...

215
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:28,101
...panties on the ground and then-

216
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:30,110
...I look up and I see
her naked in the shower...

217
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,341
...and I think, "Oh, that's
kinda sweet, she's in the shower.

218
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,023
What a perfect thing. I'm gonna
find her and maybe I'll go in there.

219
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:35,950
We never
-... ... fuck in the shower anymore.

220
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,087
Maybe today we will. " I...

221
00:13:37,097 --> 00:13:39,359
...pull the curtain back and
there's the fucking history...

222
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:40,223
...
- teacher with tenure.

223
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:49,386
And you know what he says to
me? "You should probably go. "

224
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:50,011
That's what he says to me.

225
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:55,103
So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat
him to death. But now I get fucking

226
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:58,307
chastised for it? I'm parallel
to my father? I don't think so.

227
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:02,872
All right. Can you talk about
something that you did, before or after?

228
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,078
Yeah, about a week before the
incident, I called the cops and

229
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:10,163
I told them that my wife and the
history guy were plotting against

230
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:12,299
me by embezzling money from
the local high school, which

231
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:21,504
wasn't true... It was a delusion. And
we later found out from the hospital

232
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:22,814
that's because I'm, uh...

233
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:26,042
...undiagnosed bipolar.

234
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:32,666
Yeah. With mood swings and weird
thinking brought on by severe

235
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,740
stress, which rarely happens, thank God.

236
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:41,537
And then the shower incident
happened and that's when everything

237
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:46,180
snapped, so I then realized that,
oh, wow, I've been dealing with

238
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:51,099
this my whole life. And without any
supervision I've been doing it all

239
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:56,159
on my own with no help and basically I've
been white-knuckling it this whole time.

240
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:58,451
That had to be hard.

241
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,280
Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially
when you don't know what the hell is happening,

242
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,496
which I do now. Sort of.

243
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:07,636
Pat, you have to take your medication.

244
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,089
I can't, Mom. I can't.

245
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,152
I will call them. They'll come for you.

246
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,264
Why would you do that? You wouldn't
do that. Why would you call them?

247
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:14,068
What's up?

248
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,907
I don't, I don't feel good when
I'm on them, Mom. I don't feel good.

249
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:19,233
I'm so much clearer without
them. Mom, they make me bloated.

250
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:20,588
I don't like the way it makes me look.

251
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:21,097
You've gotta take your medication.

252
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,323
Why don't you just take your medication?

253
00:15:23,228 --> 00:15:25,354
Come on, I'm doing it with my
physicality. I've been workin' out,

254
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:25,691
that's what I'm doin'.

255
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,857
Why is he wearing a garbage bag?

256
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:29,409
Why are you wearing a garbage bag?

257
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:30,525
To sweat.

258
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:34,882
Sit down. We're seven minutes in, no
score. Come on, help turn the juju around.

259
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:35,863
I don't believe in juju, Dad.

260
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,198
Come on, Mister Excelsior. You wanna
be positive? Be positive. Sit down.

261
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:40,721
All right, all right.

262
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:41,130
Come on.

263
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:42,570
For a second. I'll watch
the beginning of the game.

264
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:43,582
He says you're good... luck, honey.

265
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:44,803
What's that in your hand?

266
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,140
It's a... see?

267
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:51,344
Handkerchief? Yeah.

268
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,350
That's OCD. That's crazy.

269
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:01,624
What OCD? I want my son to watch
the game with me, so sue me.

270
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:04,864
Just sit down, come on. I want
you to watch the game with me.

271
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,270
I'm not superstitious. That's
a small thing that I do.

272
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:11,556
If I make a lot of money, what's
the difference if I do this or that?

273
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,375
It's a small thing. Sit down. Come on.

274
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:16,906
I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.

275
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:21,098
You see?! You see that?!
You're meant to be here!

276
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:24,305
This is special. Everything
happens for a reason.

277
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,477
That's why you came home.
Embrace it! Embrace it!

278
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:28,847
I'm the reason? I don't think so.

279
00:16:28,882 --> 00:16:32,348
Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes,
yes. I got your whole sheet.

280
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:33,243
Mom. Yeah. No, no...

281
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:34,325
...I'm just confirming.

282
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,279
I'm just confirming. Okay.

283
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:36,199
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

284
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:39,502
Can I do.. an interview for a
school project on mental illness? No.

285
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:41,680
It's for a school project!
Don't pay any attention.

286
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:43,716
Who's that? That's not Rick
D'Angelo, is it? That's him.

287
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:45,459
Is he the guy who's having the problem?

288
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:47,607
People are stupid. They, they, they,
they don't know what they're saying.

289
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:47,624
Yeah, that's the one.

290
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:48,835
Don't let them hurt your feelings.

291
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,020
Pat, don't look for Nikki! Take
your camera and get out of here!

292
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,438
Patrick, please. Pat!

293
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,531
Patty! Don't look for Nikki!

294
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,400
Ms. Meckers!

295
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,462
Oh, God! Oh, God!

296
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:28,864
Nance! This is my lucky day!
Look at you working on a Sunday!

297
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:30,689
How are you? Hey.

298
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:32,290
What are you doing here?

299
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:35,204
I just came by to say hi, to let you
know I'm ready to come back to work.

300
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:35,965
You shouldn't be here.

301
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:37,220
I'll work
full-time, half-time.

302
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:39,941
I'll sub, I'll work
history, whatever you want.

303
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:42,413
Here, let me give you a hand.
I'm sorry. I'm being rude.

304
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:43,340
I got it. I got it. I got it.

305
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,064
Let me ask you something.
Let me just ask you something.

306
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,458
Does Nikki still work here?

307
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:49,674
You know I can't tell you that.
But Doug Culpepper is still here.

308
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,192
Why would you tell me that? You
know he broke up my marriage.

309
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:53,995
What, are you being, a troublemaker?

310
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,227
You know, you look good.
Did you lose a lot of weight?

311
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:58,795
I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.

312
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:00,804
Get away from me! Get away!

313
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:03,568
I'm better. I just want to let
you know, I'm better now. Okay?

314
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,578
I'm better. I feel good. I
feel so good. Look at my eyes.

315
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:08,178
Look at my eyes. Look
at how clear they are.

316
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm not a complainer anymore.
I'm a positive guy. Okay?

317
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:12,337
You just have to give it some time.

318
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:13,210
Yes.

319
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,653
You know, a lot went down.
People will get over it.

320
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:15,778
It'll be all good. It'll work out.

321
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:16,829
Yes! It will be!

322
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:18,086
I'm gonna take that as a
silver development, Nancy!

323
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:20,582
A silver development!
That's a silver lining!

324
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:21,381
Good luck.

325
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:28,866
Ronnie! Pat.

326
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,818
There he is! He's back!

327
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:34,898
Hey.

328
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,340
Welcome home.

329
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:37,371
Thank you.

330
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,475
Welcome back, man.

331
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:39,394
Yeah, I'm out.

332
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:40,456
Yeah? You're out out?

333
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:41,165
Uh-huh.

334
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:43,446
Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of
weight. I almost didn't recognize you.

335
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,255
Thank you.

336
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,729
I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the
hospital. You know, work's out of

337
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:49,990
control, you know, she had the
baby. I'm really glad you're back.

338
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:55,210
I missed you. I really need someone to
talk to. You gotta come see the baby.

339
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,893
She's beautiful. And Veronica
wants to make dinner for you.

340
00:18:58,106 --> 00:19:02,028
Congratulations on the baby, but
I'm not buying the invitation.

341
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:03,897
'Cause you think
Veronica still hates you?

342
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:08,988
I know Veronica still
hates me. That's not true.

343
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:12,526
Yes, it is. Nikki always said that

344
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,255
"Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar
where she keeps his balls, in her purse. "

345
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,452
That's not true.

346
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:17,964
Ronnie! What are you doing?

347
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:21,368
Okay, it's a little true. But
if you think she still hates you,

348
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:24,325
you're wrong because why would she
tell me to invite you to dinner?

349
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,964
Hmm?

350
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,262
Did you invite him?

351
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:27,244
Yes.

352
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:28,621
Well, can he make it?

353
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,947
I don't know yet! Can you

354
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:32,899
make it next Sunday?

355
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:33,977
Sure.

356
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:35,283
I'll see you next Sunday.

357
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,195
Now, you guys are still
in touch with Nikki, right?

358
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:39,575
Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?

359
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:40,168
Yeah.

360
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,032
Get in here, please. I need you.

361
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:46,054
Okay.

362
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,243
As soon as you left, the Redskins threw
a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El.

363
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:54,926
Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging
it, loses the challenge, loses the game.

364
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:58,192
You're in this house, please
show some respect for what I do.

365
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,916
And we should spend time together anyway.
I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please.

366
00:20:02,197 --> 00:20:05,378
I have very, good news,
everybody. Very good news.

367
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:06,724
What's that? What's the good news?

368
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:09,705
Things are looking up.

369
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:10,760
Oh, are they?

370
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:14,006
You know what, I knew why they
invited me over. I knew it.

371
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:15,714
Listen, she might be with that guy.

372
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:16,555
That, the...

373
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:17,187
Oh, no way!

374
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:20,491
She..., no, she might be
with him. She's afraid of you.

375
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:21,408
She doesn't want to talk to you.

376
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,722
No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper?

377
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:24,373
Put the phone down. You gotta...

378
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:25,081
Wait just a minute.

379
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:25,818
...Put the phone down, please.

380
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:26,538
What are you doing?

381
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:27,106
Listen..., stop.

382
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:30,699
Pat!

383
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:34,870
You gotta understand me. You wanna
go back? Well then, stop this!

384
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:36,146
Then don't fucking do this.

385
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:37,201
Don't talk to me like that.

386
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Well then, don't behave this way.

387
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,188
I got... a call asking to...

388
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:42,002
...check on this house. Pat

389
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:43,852
Solatano?

390
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:44,644
Yeah.

391
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,614
Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister
Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh.

392
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,779
I work this beat. Look, I heard
about the restraining order.

393
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:50,678
And I heard you went to your
old house and the school.

394
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:53,814
It's not okay. I've been
assigned to your case, so you're

395
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:58,040
gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a
favor. Respect the restraining order, okay?

396
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:02,573
Five hundred feet. You hear what he
just said? Youhave a restraining order.

397
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:03,417
Yeah, Dad, I know.

398
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:04,201
Thank you, Officer.

399
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:05,869
If you need anything... my card.

400
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:07,728
Thank you. Sorry. We understand.

401
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:08,728
Since when do cops have cards?

402
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:18,110
Tell me one thing. Would you like
to be a guy who goes back to jail

403
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:22,479
or to the hospital? Hmm? So take
your medication and if you do fine,

404
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:23,617
we'll reduce them.

405
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:27,305
Nikki's waiting for me to get in
shape and get my life in order, and

406
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,793
then she's gonna be with me. And
that's better than any medication.

407
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:34,880
Pat, there's a possibility, and
I want you to be prepared for it,

408
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,944
that she may not return. True love
is about letting her go and seeing

409
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,768
if she returns. In the meantime,
if you listen to that song, I don't

410
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:46,617
want you to fall apart. So get
a strategy, okay? You need one.

411
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,174
Let me say something,
I gotta say something.

412
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:49,133
Okay.

413
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:52,273
This is what I believe to be true.

414
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:53,423
This is what I learned in the hospital.

415
00:21:53,618 --> 00:21:57,203
You have to do everything
you can, you have to work your

416
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:59,546
hardest, and if you do,
if you stay positive,

417
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:01,385
you have a shot at a silver lining.

418
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,611
Work on a strategy, okay?

419
00:22:08,516 --> 00:22:12,596
Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this
party on Sunday night and it's like

420
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:15,402
a real hoity-toity thing and his
wife, Veronica's a real stickler for...

421
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:19,143
I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she
wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey

422
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:20,973
that my brother, Jake,
got me from the Eagles.

423
00:22:22,822 --> 00:22:23,336
Which jersey?

424
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:25,205
DeSean Jackson.

425
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:27,527
DeSean Jackson is the man.

426
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:29,572
Well, that settles that.

427
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:40,782
Pat! What are you doin'?

428
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:43,642
I gotta go, man.

429
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:44,652
Why?

430
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:47,736
I can't stay, come on. I made a
mistake, I shouldn't have worn this.

431
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:50,291
Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey.
I wish I was wearing that jersey.

432
00:22:50,562 --> 00:22:51,049
I feel like an idiot.

433
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:51,767
Are you comfortable?

434
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:52,611
Veronica's not gonna like it.

435
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:53,265
Get over here.

436
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:53,948
Plus you got a tie on.

437
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,386
Don't worry about it, you're the guest
of honor. You come however you wanna come.

438
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:57,150
Really?

439
00:22:57,518 --> 00:22:58,130
Get over here.

440
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,948
DeSean Jackson's in the house!

441
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:02,622
You mean rookie of the year?

442
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:03,491
Yeah.

443
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,235
DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?

444
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,782
Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.

445
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:10,395
Isn't it awesome?

446
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:11,622
Not for dinner.

447
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,395
Look, he got us flowers.

448
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:16,877
Oh, that's sweet. That's
sweet, Pat. That's lovely.

449
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:17,591
And wine.

450
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:18,359
Hey.

451
00:23:18,508 --> 00:23:18,508
Hey.

452
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,347
Check this out. We just
redid the whole thing.

453
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:21,781
Wow!

454
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:23,761
Tremendous. Tremendous.

455
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:24,621
Isn't it great?

456
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:25,285
Tremendous.

457
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:26,578
Yeah, man, I'm, I'm
thinking of redoing it again.

458
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:27,198
Why?

459
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:29,277
Because. Gotta be making
a lot of paper to do that.

460
00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:31,321
Yeah, we're doing all
right, man. I can't complain.

461
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:32,360
Isn't the market down, though?

462
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:35,603
It is down, but you know, she wants
more, so I'm giving her more, man.

463
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:37,100
Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.

464
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:38,268
I'm sorry, man.

465
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:38,824
Yeah.

466
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:39,922
A lot of people. My uncle, too.

467
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:40,587
Really?

468
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:43,123
Yeah, but you know what? No
disrespect, it's not personal,

469
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,269
but this is the time to strike.

470
00:23:44,854 --> 00:23:48,067
You start snapping up commercial
real estate... cheap... flip it

471
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,168
over, you flip it over and
that's when you make the money.

472
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:54,088
But the pressure... it's like...

473
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:57,352
You okay?

474
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,815
I'm not okay. Don't tell
anybody. Listen to me.

475
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:05,730
I feel like I'm getting crushed and-

476
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:06,456
Crushed by what?

477
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:11,052
Everything. The family, the baby,
the job, the fucking dicks at work,

478
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:15,117
and it's like, you know, like I'm
trying to do this, you know, and,

479
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,525
and, and I'm like... suffocating.

480
00:24:18,977 --> 00:24:19,453
Holy shit.

481
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:22,423
You can't be happy all the time.

482
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,112
Who told you you can't be happy?

483
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:26,455
It's all right. You just do
your best, you have no choice.

484
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:28,850
That's not true at all. You just can't.

485
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,437
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!

486
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:32,050
I hope you're okay with
Veronica's sister coming over.

487
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:34,230
You okay with that? Who?

488
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:36,129
Veronica's sister.

489
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:38,027
Tiffany. Tiffany and... Tommy?

490
00:24:38,183 --> 00:24:40,043
Yeah. Just Tiffany.

491
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,024
What happened to Tommy?

492
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,986
He died.

493
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:44,541
Tommy died? Cops die.

494
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:45,329
How'd he die?

495
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:46,108
Please, don't bring it up.

496
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:46,997
No, how did he die?

497
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:49,127
How did who die?

498
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,464
Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat.
Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.

499
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:00,811
You look nice.

500
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,175
Thank you.

501
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:03,633
I'm not flirting with you.

502
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:05,517
Oh, I didn't think you were.

503
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:07,744
I just see that you made an effort
and I'm gonna be better with my

504
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,907
wife, I'm working on that. I
wanna acknowledge her beauty.

505
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:13,447
I never used to do that. I do that now.

506
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:16,593
'Cause we're gonna be better than
ever... Nikki. Just practicing.

507
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:17,902
How'd Tommy die?

508
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:21,989
What about your job?

509
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,973
I just got fired, actually.

510
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:25,920
Oh, really? How?

511
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:29,258
I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?

512
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,205
Does it really matter?

513
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,159
Baby, how's it going?

514
00:25:35,478 --> 00:25:36,277
Great, great.

515
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:47,228
We're gonna go on a tour now.

516
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:47,729
Let's go see the house.

517
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,014
Come on, let's go for the tour.

518
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,407
I've, I've been planning this
forever. I love our house.

519
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,125
I love our house. I'm
really excited about it.

520
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:55,277
Come on.

521
00:25:56,277 --> 00:25:57,607
Guess what it is.

522
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,098
Oh, it's a television. It's
a computer screen. Nope.

523
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:02,034
Just keep going, keep going, keep going.

524
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:04,490
It's a brick oven, it's a brick
oven. It's a light. It's a...

525
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:05,397
Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.

526
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,049
...it's a drawer at a morgue
where they pull out dead

527
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,494
bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.
Where would the body go, though?

528
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:11,106
It's a joke!

529
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:15,234
It's a... fireplace.

530
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,060
In the middle of the wall?

531
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:20,096
We have a port in every
room. Gimme an iPod.

532
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:21,497
Who, who doesn't have an iPod?

533
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,371
Well, I don't have an iPod.
I don't even have a phone.

534
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:28,371
They won't let me make any calls.
They think I'm gonna call Nikki.

535
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:30,017
Don't worry about it.
Don't focus on that.

536
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,312
I would call Nikki.

537
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:34,003
I'm actually gonna give you one
of my iPods. I have an old one.

538
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:34,987
Gimme your iPod.

539
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:37,002
Give it to me. Thank
you, baby, thank you.

540
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:39,046
Of all the rooms there
are iPod ports in,

541
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:41,254
I'm happy you brought
us into the bathroom.

542
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:43,374
I can play music for
the baby in any room.

543
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:45,243
Can you play "Ride the
Lightning" by Metallica?

544
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:51,019
Pat was a history sub at
the high school, Tiffany.

545
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:54,063
Ask him about any
president, he knows 'em all.

546
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:57,379
Here's a fun fact. You know
where the term "OK" comes from?

547
00:26:57,598 --> 00:26:58,741
No. No, I don't.

548
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:00,231
Where?

549
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:03,060
Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth
president of the United States of

550
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:04,839
America, is from Kinderhook, New York...

551
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,354
Oh.

552
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:09,119
...and he was part of a club, a
men's club, called Old Kinderhook.

553
00:27:09,523 --> 00:27:12,027
And if you were cool, you
were in the club, they'd say,

554
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:15,253
"That guy's OK. " 'Cause he
was in the Old Kinderhooks.

555
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,745
Really?

556
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:16,904
Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

557
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:17,628
That's interesting.

558
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:20,484
You know, Tiffany's been doing
this dance thing for years and she's

559
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:24,045
real good at it. She's gonna be
competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.

560
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:26,522
Oh, really? My wife loves
dance. Nikki loves dance.

561
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:28,156
Why do you have to
talk about me like that?

562
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:30,199
I'm just bragging about you. Can't
I brag about my little sister?

563
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:32,020
Don't talk about me in the third person.

564
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:34,037
Please, gimme a break.

565
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:35,449
I'm right here.

566
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,513
Just be nice. Just be nice.

567
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,534
Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.

568
00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:41,428
Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.

569
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:43,558
I know. I know, I know.

570
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:45,821
What meds are you on?

571
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:51,426
Me? None. I used to be on
Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify,

572
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:54,048
but I don't take them
anymore, no. They make me foggy

573
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:56,254
and they also make me bloated.

574
00:27:56,362 --> 00:28:00,049
Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor,
but I agree, I wasn't as sharp,

575
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,203
so I stopped. You ever take Klonopin?

576
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:03,129
Klonopin? Yeah.

577
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:04,073
Right? Jesus.

578
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,000
It's like, "What? What day
is it?" How about Trazodone?

579
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:09,391
Trazodone!

580
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:12,078
Oh, it flattens you out.
I mean, you are done.

581
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,147
It takes the light
right out of your eyes.

582
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,203
God, I bet it does.

583
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:22,276
I'm tired. I wanna go.

584
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,334
No. No, no, no, no. We haven't,
we haven't even finished the salad

585
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:29,448
yet, or the duck. I made
the Fire and Ice cake.

586
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:33,232
I said I'm tired. Are you
gonna walk me home or what?

587
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:37,035
You mean me?

588
00:28:37,104 --> 00:28:39,256
Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?

589
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:43,025
You have poor social
skills. You have a problem.

590
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:46,073
I have a problem? You say
more inappropriate things than

591
00:28:46,086 --> 00:28:48,417
appropriate things. You scare people.

592
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:49,070
I tell the truth. But you're mean.

593
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:50,753
What? I'm not telling the truth?

594
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,163
Um, maybe I should drive
them home separately?

595
00:28:55,631 --> 00:28:58,411
You can drive them both home. Now.

596
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,391
Stop talking about me in third person.
You can take Tiffany home first.

597
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:03,064
You love it when I have problems.

598
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:06,293
You love it, Von, because then you
can be the good one. Just say it.

599
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:09,205
No... I don't. I don't. I
just wanted to have a nice,

600
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,744
I just wanted to have
a nice dinner. Oh, God.

601
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:12,388
What is your problem?!

602
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:14,389
Nothing's my problem! I'm
fine. I'm tired and I wanna go.

603
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:15,266
Come on, are you ready?

604
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:17,256
You really, you really
wanna go right now?

605
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:19,024
Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.

606
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,152
Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!

607
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:22,341
Sorry. I don't wanna
wake up the baby. Bye.

608
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:44,094
Listen, I haven't dated since
before my marriage so I don't

609
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:44,883
really remember how this works.

610
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:48,650
How what works?

611
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:50,420
I saw the way you were
looking at me, Pat.

612
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:55,214
You felt it, I felt it, don't
lie. We're not liars like they are.

613
00:29:56,817 --> 00:29:59,900
I live in the addition around
back, which is completely

614
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:03,408
separate from my parents' house,
so there's no chance of them walking

615
00:30:03,443 --> 00:30:06,846
in on us. I hate the fact that you
wore a football jersey to dinner

616
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:09,947
because I hate football, but you can
fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?

617
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:12,344
How old are you?

618
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:18,403
Old enough to have a marriage end
and not wind up in a mental hospital.

619
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:24,533
Look, I had a really good time
tonight and I think you're really

620
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:25,943
pretty, but I'm married, okay?

621
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:32,546
You're married? So am I.

622
00:30:34,314 --> 00:30:35,784
No, that's confusing. He's dead.

623
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:43,042
Wait, what?

624
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:44,811
What's happening?

625
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:51,764
Oh, my God. Hey.

626
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:19,023
Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey,
is that make-up on your shirt?

627
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,077
I don't know, Mom.

628
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,272
What happened over there?

629
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:22,614
When am I gonna get a phone?

630
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:23,981
You'll get a phone in due time.

631
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:24,800
What happened?

632
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,624
Pat!

633
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:50,168
Mom!

634
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:53,181
I can't find my wedding
video. Mom, wake up.

635
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:54,228
What is it?

636
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:55,276
Where's my wedding video?

637
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:56,458
It's after three o'clock!
What are you doing?

638
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:58,573
I looked in here, but this is all
your sewing shit up here, for your

639
00:31:58,673 --> 00:32:00,208
sewing and everything.
Did you put it up here?

640
00:32:00,243 --> 00:32:02,587
What about in your father's study?

641
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,501
Don't go in my study.

642
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:05,933
Dad, not now!

643
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,877
Would you put it in here? It makes
no sense for you to put it in here.

644
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,212
Patty, what are you doing?

645
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,138
He's got all his Eagles videos
and not one video of my wedding!

646
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:12,038
Is it here? I mean...?

647
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:12,489
Patty!

648
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,518
It's probably in the attic.

649
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:15,518
Are you going in my study?

650
00:32:16,443 --> 00:32:18,136
It feels to me like you
wanna hide my wedding video.

651
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,298
Please stop yelling!

652
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,388
I'm not yelling, Mom,
I'm just frustrated

653
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,952
because I should have
my fucking wedding video!

654
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,616
Pat! Pat!

655
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:30,977
I looked over there! I
already looked all over there!

656
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,024
Calm down, Pat.

657
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:38,634
I'm not calming down! I
don't give a fuck who hears,

658
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:40,775
I'm not calming down!
Anybody can wake up!

659
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,846
I'm not ashamed of it!
I'm not ashamed of it!

660
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:45,369
Let the whole neighborhood
wake up! I... don't care!

661
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:46,401
Pat! Stop it!

662
00:32:46,436 --> 00:32:47,300
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

663
00:32:47,335 --> 00:32:48,190
What's going on?

664
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:49,510
What?

665
00:32:50,082 --> 00:32:50,489
I want it! It
-...

666
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:51,200
Hey!

667
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:55,030
It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!

668
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:56,974
Pat! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

669
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:01,294
I can't watch my wedding video,
but I CAN hear the fucking song

670
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:17,956
Mom?

671
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:19,468
What the fuck you doing?!
You... hit your mother?!

672
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:20,653
No, no, no, no, no!

673
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,659
Stop it!

674
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:24,954
Get off me, Dad!

675
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:27,025
Stop hitting him!

676
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,062
Stop hitting him!

677
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,490
I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me!

678
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:40,072
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

679
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:46,416
Police! Open up.

680
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,521
Mister Solatano, I got a lot of calls.

681
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:49,370
People in the neighborhood
are scared. I gotta come in.

682
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:51,883
How are we doing in here, huh?

683
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:55,937
There are a lot of reports from your
neighbors, we got a lot of phone calls.

684
00:33:55,972 --> 00:33:58,720
Nikki is being manipulated and
controlled. You have to talk to her.

685
00:33:58,755 --> 00:33:59,522
Hey, sit down.

686
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:00,252
Sit down.

687
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:02,229
You gotta stop with
these crazy theories.

688
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:03,361
He's a cop. What are you doing?

689
00:34:03,396 --> 00:34:06,327
It's a medication
problem, but he's fine now.

690
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:08,249
Oh yeah? He's fine now? You
wanna send him back to Baltimore?

691
00:34:08,284 --> 00:34:10,137
We know all about the explosion
at the psychiatrist's office.

692
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:10,636
What?

693
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:13,120
What explosion? No. Cliff
is lying, that's not true.

694
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:14,336
He's not allowed to talk about that.

695
00:34:14,371 --> 00:34:16,645
Jesus Christ, who's that?

696
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,448
Keep an eye on him.

697
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:19,746
Is this a bipolar episode?

698
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:21,876
Get outta here, you little fuckin'

699
00:34:21,911 --> 00:34:22,755
idiot! Get outta here!

700
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,565
Someone, help me! Help me!

701
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,644
You can't tell Nikki about this,

702
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,178
Officer.

703
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,244
Look, I gotta make out a report.

704
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:26,855
No, no! No!

705
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:27,199
No, no, no, listen, sir.

706
00:34:28,444 --> 00:34:30,799
He's chasing me! This
guy's chasing me! Help me!

707
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,805
Sit down!

708
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,421
I'm sorry. I could just write
you a letter and you could just

709
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:35,968
let me have five minutes,
explaining how much better I'm doing.

710
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:38,509
There's a court order against you...
five hundred feet. Listen to me!

711
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:41,074
...and I'll take that fucking
camera and I'm gonna break it over

712
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:43,675
your fuckin' head, then I'm gonna
come back and interview you about

713
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,242
what it's like to get that fuckin'
camera broken over your head!

714
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:47,598
Youwa..., what are you laughing about?

715
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,769
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

716
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:49,209
I'm sorry.

717
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:49,725
Okay.

718
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:54,388
Go back to sleep. The
party's over. Show's over.

719
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:56,992
...this is not a reflection of
where I'm at. You can't... please,

720
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:59,561
you can't tell her any of this
You can't tell Nikki about this.

721
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:00,315
You need to pipe down.

722
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,264
Everything all right?

723
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,212
Who was at the door?

724
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:03,091
Who was that, Dad?

725
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:04,857
It was that kid with the camera.

726
00:35:04,892 --> 00:35:06,554
Good luck. I gotta write this up.

727
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:08,894
Come on, don't write it up!
I don't want her to see this!

728
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:09,465
It's okay, everything is
okay. We're fine, thank you,

729
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,214
we appreciate it. Thank you.

730
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:10,907
Hey!

731
00:36:10,942 --> 00:36:12,017
What the hell?

732
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:14,908
What happened to your face?

733
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:15,817
Weight lifting accident.

734
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:20,055
That sounds like bullshit.
Why'd you run by my house?

735
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:22,954
Did our little conversation
get you upset last night?

736
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:24,793
Hey, this is my route,
okay? Just back off.

737
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:26,834
This is my neighborhood.
You just ran by my house.

738
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:28,888
I like to run by myself, okay?

739
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:29,910
Me too.

740
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,772
Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?

741
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:32,698
What?

742
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,542
Okay? I'm running here! Me too!

743
00:36:34,637 --> 00:36:36,165
Well then, why don't
you run somewhere else?

744
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:37,853
There's a fucking ton of roads to
run in! What are you trying to do?

745
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,688
I like this road. This
is my neighborhood.

746
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:40,593
Oh, come on, please!

747
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,631
Calm down, crazy.

748
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:08,578
Hey!

749
00:37:08,636 --> 00:37:08,812
What the fuck?!

750
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:10,439
I'm married!

751
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:11,648
So am I!

752
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:13,651
What the fuck are you
doing? Your husband's dead!

753
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:15,094
Where is your wife?

754
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:15,993
You're crazy!

755
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:19,439
I'm not the one that just got
out of that hospital in Baltimore.

756
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:20,562
I'm not the big slut!

757
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:26,917
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

758
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:30,802
I was a big slut, but I'm not
anymore. There's always gonna be a

759
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:34,324
part of me that's sloppy and dirty,
but I like that, with all the other

760
00:37:34,697 --> 00:37:37,334
parts of myself. Can you say
the same about yourself, fucker?!

761
00:37:37,957 --> 00:37:40,324
Can you forgive? Are
you any good at that?

762
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:47,299
You seemed to have trouble last night.

763
00:37:48,357 --> 00:37:49,319
Let me just set the record
straight about last night.

764
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,060
Hurting my mother was a mistake
and I hate myself for it,

765
00:37:52,497 --> 00:37:54,299
and I hate my illness
and I want to control it.

766
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:56,321
My father, on the other
hand, had no trouble

767
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,231
slapping the shit out of me last
night, which I did not return

768
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,693
'cause I could've killed him and I
didn't. He's sixty-five years old.

769
00:38:01,965 --> 00:38:03,319
You don't think I could've beat
the shit out of him? I mean...

770
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,608
He was scared for your mother
and you hurt him as well.

771
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:09,763
Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I
think he probably just tried to do his best.

772
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:13,424
Pat, you have to have a
strategy. I told you earlier.

773
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:17,245
You need to recognize these feelings
coming to you, otherwise you will be sent

774
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:21,514
back to Baltimore. So when you get
these feelings, you need to get to

775
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,221
a quieter place, and be at peace
with yourself, however you can.

776
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:26,218
Yeah, but that's easier said than done.

777
00:38:26,629 --> 00:38:29,518
You have to do it. You
have no choice. Excelsior.

778
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:34,071
Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have
a letter I want you to give Nikki,

779
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:35,149
okay?

780
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:36,396
No.

781
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:37,376
Why?

782
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:38,553
Because you have a restraining

783
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,238
order.

784
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:41,861
What good are you, man?

785
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:45,908
Why did you have this
overwhelming urgency to see your

786
00:38:46,154 --> 00:38:46,762
wedding video last night?

787
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:48,858
Oh, I don't know, because I'm
married and I haven't seen my wife

788
00:38:49,104 --> 00:38:49,669
in eight and a half months?

789
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:52,609
Maybe you think that Nikki's not
around and Tiffany's an attractive

790
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:56,114
girl and if you get drawn towards
Tiffany, you will spoil your

791
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:57,797
chances of getting Nikki back to you?

792
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:00,953
Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I
don't think I'm gonna blow it

793
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,300
with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.

794
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:05,300
Why is she a slut?

795
00:39:05,327 --> 00:39:06,330
After the dinner at Ronnie's,

796
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:12,542
she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and
you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out. "

797
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:16,422
Unquote. And she still
wears her wedding ring.

798
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:18,791
So she's a loyal,
married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

799
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,350
Maybe she just needs a friend and
she thought if she offers you sex,

800
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,527
it will be easier for you
to become friends with her.

801
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:31,996
She said she's not a whore anymore,
but she likes that part of herself

802
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:34,903
along with all the other parts
of herself and can I say the same?

803
00:39:35,757 --> 00:39:36,239
Can you?

804
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:40,761
Is that...? You're asking me, you're
really asking me that question?

805
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:41,576
Yes.

806
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,445
With all my crazy sad shit?
What, are you fucking nuts?

807
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:49,688
Pat, the silver lining thing is
yours. I'm just giving back your

808
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:54,034
words to you. This "crazy sad
shit, " as you call it, made you a

809
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:57,751
happier, calmer person with a
beautiful positive philosophy of

810
00:39:57,988 --> 00:40:00,561
going outdoors, working
out, and reading books.

811
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:04,746
No, not the books. You
said Nikki's friends with

812
00:40:04,962 --> 00:40:07,997
Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So
if you become friends with Tiffany,

813
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,666
Nikki will think that you're
a kind, generous, large-hearted

814
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:16,590
person, who helps people in need,
who is basically thriving. So if

815
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:19,575
you help Tiffany, it
will be good for you.

816
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:42,770
Hey!

817
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,429
How do you know when I run?

818
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:47,323
I wanted to clarify something.

819
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:49,381
I just want us to be friends.

820
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:52,790
Did you hear what I said?

821
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:56,896
Why are you giving me such a hard time?

822
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:00,609
No, I'm not giving you a hard time.

823
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,091
I don't know how to act with
you when you do this shit.

824
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:09,081
You wanna have dinner at this diner?

825
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:14,785
Pick me up at seven thirty.

826
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:53,791
Happy Halloween.

827
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:54,200
Hi.

828
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,008
Here you go.

829
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:17,902
Thank you.

830
00:42:21,112 --> 00:42:22,114
I'm gonna have a bowl
of your Raisin Bran.

831
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,125
Great!

832
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:29,777
Tea Be right back.

833
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:36,758
You look nice.

834
00:42:37,726 --> 00:42:37,947
Thanks.

835
00:42:41,948 --> 00:42:44,353
Raisin Bran. Milk.

836
00:42:47,285 --> 00:42:47,535
Thank you.

837
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:04,283
You want to share this?

838
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:06,725
Why did you order Raisin Bran?

839
00:43:09,302 --> 00:43:09,961
Why did you order tea?

840
00:43:12,212 --> 00:43:13,368
Because you ordered Raisin Bran.

841
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,394
I ordered Raisin Bran because
I didn't want there to be any

842
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:17,599
mistaking this for a date.

843
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,289
It can still be a date
if you order Raisin Bran.

844
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:26,827
It's not a date. So how's your
thing going... your dancing thing?

845
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:28,916
It's good. How's your restraining order?

846
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:31,644
I wouldn't actually call the
restraining order "my thing, "

847
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:35,800
but getting back with Nikki is,
and I've been doing pretty well.

848
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:38,745
Except for a minor incident
at the doctor's office.

849
00:43:39,278 --> 00:43:40,473
And the so-called
incident with the weights.

850
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,966
Yeah. That was a thing with
my parents. I wish I could just

851
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:49,258
explain it all in a letter to Nikki
because it was minor and I could

852
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:51,905
just explain it and let her
know that I'm actually not out of

853
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:55,835
control and that I'm
actually doing really well.

854
00:44:04,885 --> 00:44:08,638
I can get a letter to Nikki. I
see her sometimes with my sister.

855
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:22,277
It would be so amazing if you
could get a letter to Nikki from me.

856
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:26,690
I'd have to hide it from Veronica.
She's not into breaking the law,

857
00:44:26,985 --> 00:44:29,186
which this letter would
definitely be doing.

858
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:31,778
But you would do it?

859
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:39,022
I'd have to be careful. I'm
already on thin ice with my family,

860
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,548
you should hear how I lost my job.

861
00:44:41,538 --> 00:44:42,274
How did you lose your job?

862
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,046
By... having sex with
everybody in the office.

863
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:52,445
Everybody?

864
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:56,034
I was very depressed after Tommy
died. It was a lot of people.

865
00:44:57,005 --> 00:44:57,814
We don't have to talk about it.

866
00:44:58,327 --> 00:44:58,834
Thanks.

867
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,048
How many were there?

868
00:45:00,288 --> 00:45:00,794
Eleven.

869
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:01,467
Wow.

870
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:02,347
I know.

871
00:45:04,156 --> 00:45:05,161
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

872
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:05,804
Okay.

873
00:45:07,844 --> 00:45:09,170
Can I ask you one more question?

874
00:45:11,914 --> 00:45:12,487
Were there any women?

875
00:45:13,105 --> 00:45:14,650
Yes.

876
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:15,539
Really?

877
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:16,615
Yes.

878
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:18,999
What was that like?

879
00:45:20,145 --> 00:45:20,643
Hot.

880
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:28,255
Jesus Christ. Was it
like... older women,

881
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,446
a sexy teacher who wants to seduce you-

882
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,669
Made me sit on her lap
and do things? Yeah.

883
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:37,636
What? You sat on her lap?

884
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:38,616
Mm-hmm.

885
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:39,925
She told you what to do?

886
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:40,777
Mm-hmm.

887
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,802
Oh... my God. Nikki hated
when I talked like this.

888
00:45:46,604 --> 00:45:48,589
Made me feel like such a pervert.
Maybe we should change the subject.

889
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:49,295
I don't mind it.

890
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:51,856
You don't, do you.

891
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:58,427
No. But then people were getting
into fights in the parking lot at

892
00:45:58,698 --> 00:46:04,527
work, and in the bathroom... and the
boss called me in to his office and

893
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:10,075
tried to pin it all on me. So I
accused him of harassment and then

894
00:46:10,315 --> 00:46:14,673
they fired me, sent me home
and put me on some meds.

895
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:20,948
I get it. The song that
was playing when my wife...

896
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,801
was in the shower with
the history teacher...

897
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:24,853
I heard about that.

898
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:27,930
...it was my wedding song and
when I hear it, I go kinda crazy.

899
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:29,686
Sometimes I hear it when
it's not even playing.

900
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:31,930
Wow.

901
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:36,661
Yeah. So they put me on
medication, which I feel ashamed of.

902
00:46:37,048 --> 00:46:37,339
Yeah.

903
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:39,290
So I know.

904
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:40,791
You do.

905
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:43,540
I just gotta get a strategy, you know?

906
00:46:45,225 --> 00:46:45,476
Me too.

907
00:46:47,298 --> 00:46:48,243
We'd better get back to the letter.

908
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:49,655
Yeah, let's get back to the letter.

909
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:53,155
What if you told Nikki when
Veronica was in the bathroom?

910
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:59,394
Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.

911
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:01,836
Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home
and write the letter right now.

912
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,902
Can I at least finish my tea?

913
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:04,987
Wait, what?

914
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:06,372
My tea. Can I finish it?

915
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:10,132
Wait a minute. Did Veronica
tell Nikki about our dinner?

916
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:13,309
Why would she do that? Was it a test?

917
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,579
I kinda got that feeling, yeah.

918
00:47:16,027 --> 00:47:20,948
Goddamn it. I knew it. It
was a test. How did I do?

919
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:21,773
I think I did pretty well.

920
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,476
Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.

921
00:47:24,752 --> 00:47:27,715
"Basically"? Was I some
percentage not cool?

922
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,522
No, she said you were
cool, but you know.

923
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,855
No, I don't know.

924
00:47:35,172 --> 00:47:37,997
Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.

925
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:40,278
What do you mean? How am
I? What does that mean?

926
00:47:41,232 --> 00:47:41,810
Sort of like me.

927
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:47,777
"Sort of like you"? I hope to
God she didn't tell Nikki that.

928
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:49,783
Why?

929
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:55,252
Because, it's just not right,
lumping you and I together,

930
00:47:55,387 --> 00:47:59,558
I mean, it's just wrong.
And Nikki wouldn't like that.

931
00:48:01,273 --> 00:48:02,206
Especially after all the
shit you just told me.

932
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:07,880
You think that I'm crazier than you.

933
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:12,648
Because, well, we're different, I mean-

934
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:19,497
Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me.

935
00:48:22,063 --> 00:48:27,482
You know what? Forget
I offered to help you.

936
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:31,863
Forget the entire fucking
idea. 'Cause that must have been

937
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:36,550
fucking crazy because I am
so much crazier than you.

938
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:37,602
Keep your voice down.

939
00:48:37,863 --> 00:48:40,765
I'm just the crazy slut
with a dead husband!

940
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:43,004
Forget it!

941
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:43,918
Shut the fuck up.

942
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:44,823
Fuck you!

943
00:48:46,415 --> 00:48:47,707
You shut the fuck up!

944
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:48,721
Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany!

945
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:00,089
Slow down, Raisin Bran.

946
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:05,491
Hey, come on. Look, I don't
think you're crazy, all right?

947
00:49:05,727 --> 00:49:06,334
Yes, you do.

948
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:06,993
No, I don't.

949
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,092
You told your therapist that you
were in a superior mental illness

950
00:49:10,426 --> 00:49:11,192
category, didn't you?

951
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:12,545
What? Hey, calm down! Hey-

952
00:49:12,747 --> 00:49:13,366
Just leave me alone!

953
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:15,219
Can I just explain myself, please?

954
00:49:16,968 --> 00:49:19,219
I didn't want Nikki to think that
I was associated with that kind of

955
00:49:19,587 --> 00:49:21,246
sexual behavior because I've never
done anything like that, okay?

956
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:24,180
You may not have experienced
the shit that I did.

957
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:26,431
But you loved hearing
about it, didn't you?

958
00:49:27,983 --> 00:49:32,415
You are afraid to be alive, you're
afraid to live. You're a hypocrite.

959
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:37,435
You're a conformist. You're a liar.
I opened up to you and you judged me.

960
00:49:37,671 --> 00:49:40,052
You are an asshole. You are an asshole!

961
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:42,226
Get off of me! Get off!

962
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:43,324
You're harassing me!

963
00:49:43,702 --> 00:49:44,851
Hey, hey!

964
00:49:45,054 --> 00:49:45,542
He's harassing me!

965
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:48,704
Get off!

966
00:49:48,854 --> 00:49:50,091
Take it easy. Dude, relax.

967
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:51,002
He's harassing me!

968
00:49:51,181 --> 00:49:53,016
Bro, get off of me.

969
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:54,099
He's harassing me!

970
00:49:54,144 --> 00:49:56,200
Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right?

971
00:49:56,388 --> 00:50:01,403
Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut up.

972
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:02,425
Stop it.

973
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:15,244
Hey, hey, hey, get off me!

974
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,147
What are you doing? Come
on. What are you doing?

975
00:50:17,273 --> 00:50:18,112
What are you doing to these kids?

976
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:19,958
Are you being a punk on
Halloween with these kids?

977
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:22,119
You wanna go back to Baltimore?
Is that what you wanna do?

978
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:22,984
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-

979
00:50:29,805 --> 00:50:31,448
It's the kids!

980
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:33,966
Honestly He didn't do
anything, it was all the kids.

981
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,039
Let's go, clear out,
nothing going on here.

982
00:50:38,059 --> 00:50:43,610
Come on man what you gonna do about that song?
You gonna go your whole life scared of that song?

983
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:45,174
It's just a song.
Don't make it a monster.

984
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:50,359
Come on breath! There's no
song playing. There's no song.

985
00:50:59,397 --> 00:51:00,721
That's it.

986
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:09,241
That's it. There you
go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

987
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:10,397
I'm sorry.

988
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:12,310
I took it too far.

989
00:51:13,189 --> 00:51:13,930
I'm sorry.

990
00:51:14,734 --> 00:51:15,161
Hey, is he messing with you?

991
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:17,517
No, no. No, this was just a
joke. This is a joke I started.

992
00:51:17,854 --> 00:51:19,698
There's a restraining order on this guy.

993
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:20,990
I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.

994
00:51:21,216 --> 00:51:21,891
That's not a good thing to do.

995
00:51:22,097 --> 00:51:24,070
Well, I'm fucked up. What
can I tell you? I'm sorry.

996
00:51:24,638 --> 00:51:25,412
You're Tommy's widow, right?

997
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:29,437
Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow,
minus the whore thing for the most part.

998
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:33,565
You're a funny girl. You
wanna get a drink sometime?

999
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,457
What'd I say? She doesn't,
she doesn't do that anymore.

1000
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:54,057
I'm sorry about what
I said in the diner.

1001
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:56,572
I know. I know you didn't mean it.

1002
00:51:57,087 --> 00:51:57,952
I didn't mean it at all.

1003
00:51:58,312 --> 00:51:59,850
I know, you say shit you
don't mean all the time.

1004
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,442
All the time. I'll still give
your letter to Nikki, don't worry.

1005
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:06,167
Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany.

1006
00:52:07,512 --> 00:52:08,237
I know you do.

1007
00:52:08,427 --> 00:52:17,762
You do? Yeah, sure. I'll see
you tomorrow? With the letter?

1008
00:52:21,713 --> 00:52:23,317
I'll bet I know what happened
if only one is missing.

1009
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:27,697
Either Dolores or Pat needed an
envelope and one of 'em took it.

1010
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,642
That's the only answer. No, no, no.

1011
00:52:31,271 --> 00:52:34,575
Dolores, somebody was in my study.
Who took one of my envelopes?

1012
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,662
Somebody took an envelope.

1013
00:52:37,395 --> 00:52:39,010
Maybe we should call the FBI.

1014
00:52:39,428 --> 00:52:40,362
Don't make fun. This is serious.

1015
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:44,086
What FBI? Come on, let's take a
look. I'll show you what this is.

1016
00:52:44,337 --> 00:52:46,467
I'm gonna just explain to you
something. I mean, you know what

1017
00:52:46,637 --> 00:52:49,095
I'm doing, honey. This
everything, like this.

1018
00:52:49,362 --> 00:52:50,543
I got this, it all corresponds.

1019
00:52:50,978 --> 00:52:51,717
Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes.

1020
00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:52,492
I hope that's not a problem

1021
00:52:52,652 --> 00:52:55,104
No, it's not okay. It's
not okay. You gotta ask.

1022
00:52:55,312 --> 00:52:57,171
"Do not go in my study
or I will eat you!"

1023
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:58,060
It's not funny, it's not funny.

1024
00:52:58,312 --> 00:52:59,788
What's everybody making
a joke out of this for?

1025
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:02,415
Dolores, you are so beautiful!

1026
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:05,014
Stop that! Hey, hey,
hey, stop, stop, stop!

1027
00:53:06,507 --> 00:53:09,552
Listen, a lot of envelopes go
in and out of my office every day

1028
00:53:09,894 --> 00:53:11,401
after games with a lot of cash in

1029
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:13,087
'em. So show some respect for what I do.

1030
00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:14,612
Yeah, I know. I
saw two-seven-four.

1031
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:15,567
I just wanted to tell you the number.

1032
00:53:15,702 --> 00:53:16,282
Thank you.

1033
00:53:16,297 --> 00:53:18,271
But the envelope was empty.
I'm sorry, you were sleeping.

1034
00:53:18,306 --> 00:53:19,442
I didn't want to wake you,
but I needed an envelope.

1035
00:53:19,624 --> 00:53:21,771
You didn't want to wake me?
He didn't want to wake me.

1036
00:53:22,064 --> 00:53:25,389
He doesn't have a problem complaining
about Ernest fucking Hemingway.

1037
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:27,402
He doesn't have a problem
asking for his wedding video-

1038
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:29,399
Be nice. It's game day! I'm
makin crabby snacks and homemades.

1039
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:32,527
Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come
on, she's making crabby snacks and

1040
00:53:32,732 --> 00:53:33,347
homemades. Come on, Dad!

1041
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:37,187
What are you so up about?

1042
00:53:38,137 --> 00:53:39,640
He's very happy. I'm happy.

1043
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:40,832
No, you're so up, up, up, up.

1044
00:53:40,972 --> 00:53:41,797
Isn't that a good thing?

1045
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:44,537
You're just up, up, up.
I don't know what that is.

1046
00:53:44,707 --> 00:53:46,862
Are you taking the proper
dosage of your medication?

1047
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:48,828
Am I taking the right
dose? Of course I am.

1048
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,607
Okay. Taking a little
bit too many or something?

1049
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,067
No, if I was taking that,
I'd be on the floor, Dad.

1050
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:57,972
Just stay with us. Stay for the
game. Spend some family time.

1051
00:53:58,223 --> 00:53:59,157
Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go.

1052
00:53:59,317 --> 00:54:03,016
Spend family time. Wait, you
mean OCD, superstitious time?

1053
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:05,326
Come on, your dad needs
a winner. Help him out.

1054
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:07,647
Come on. I can't. It's the Seahawks.

1055
00:54:07,797 --> 00:54:13,039
Put on the jersey and stay, please.
Please. It's important, please.

1056
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:15,623
What are you up to,
Pat? Nothing, come on.

1057
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:16,668
What's in the envelope?

1058
00:54:16,913 --> 00:54:19,037
Yeah, what are you doing?
What's in that envelope?

1059
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:21,934
Guys, I'm beating the
song! I'm on the scoreboard!

1060
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:24,402
I'm playing down field! I feel great!

1061
00:54:40,092 --> 00:54:41,667
Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here?

1062
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:43,054
What do you want with her?

1063
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:45,916
Is that another creep? What do
you want, creep? Just beat it.

1064
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,566
Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.

1065
00:54:47,824 --> 00:54:49,543
Oh, great, a married
creep. I'm her friend.

1066
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,277
We go running. Have you guys not
seen us? I took her to the diner.

1067
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:53,079
She's not here.

1068
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:56,308
Hi, guys. How's it going?
Hey. Is Tiffany home? Go away.

1069
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,335
I know her. I know her,
we've dated. We still date.

1070
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:01,839
What are you doing here? I've
called her, I've texted her.

1071
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:04,000
I still haven't heard back.
We used to work together-

1072
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:05,354
Just get the hell out of here...

1073
00:55:05,439 --> 00:55:06,375
I just wanted to give you
my card to give to her.

1074
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,901
Another rude creep.
Listen to what he's saying.

1075
00:55:07,939 --> 00:55:09,019
Listen to what he's
saying. What's he saying?

1076
00:55:09,164 --> 00:55:09,902
He's saying you're being rude.

1077
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:10,369
How am I being rude?

1078
00:55:10,864 --> 00:55:11,733
Oh, you know. You know. Come on.

1079
00:55:11,899 --> 00:55:14,879
Sometimes it's okay with girls like
this, they wanna have fun and sometimes -

1080
00:55:15,096 --> 00:55:17,294
- it's not because they got a
broken wing, and they're hurt,

1081
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:20,409
and they're an easy target. And in
this case, in this particular case,

1082
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:21,959
I think that wing is being fixed.

1083
00:55:22,115 --> 00:55:24,991
And you gotta make sure it gets
mended. And you're gettin' in the

1084
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:27,104
way of that right now, okay?
Because she's sensitive and she's

1085
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,588
smart, she's artistic. This is
a great girl and you gotta be

1086
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:31,212
respectful of that. Come on.

1087
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:33,659
Let me walk you down to your car.
You're a better guy than this.

1088
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:35,426
I can see it in your
eyes. She just texted me!

1089
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:49,691
Hey! Hey, wait a second! What
are you doing? What happened?

1090
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,620
How come you weren't outside?
What the hell's going on?

1091
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:53,281
I can't, I can't do it.

1092
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,334
What do you mean, you can't
do it? You can't do what?

1093
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,702
I can't give the letter to Nikki.

1094
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:59,874
Tiffany, what are you talking
about? What do you mean you can't

1095
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:02,379
give the letter to Nikki? Because
what am I getting in return?

1096
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:05,429
What are you doing for me? You
said! You said if I wrote a letter,

1097
00:56:05,576 --> 00:56:07,195
you'd get it to Nikki. I
know. That was the set-up.

1098
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,923
Because I do this time after time
after time, I do all this shit for

1099
00:56:10,048 --> 00:56:13,984
other people and then I wake up
and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!

1100
00:56:14,684 --> 00:56:16,531
What are you talking about? You
seem like you're a tough girl to

1101
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:18,115
me. Why don't you just
do things on your own?

1102
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:21,330
I always get myself in these
fucking situations. I give

1103
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,367
everything to other people and
nobody ever, I never... I don't get

1104
00:56:25,522 --> 00:56:27,862
what I want, okay? I'm not my sister.

1105
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:35,676
Alright, well, ask for
you. What can I do for you?

1106
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,950
I can't do it. Tiffany,
what do you want me to do?

1107
00:56:43,994 --> 00:56:46,175
Think of something. There's this thing.

1108
00:56:46,797 --> 00:56:47,948
There's a thing, okay.
What kind of thing?

1109
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:52,210
It's a thing, it's a thing.
It's a, it's a dance thing.

1110
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:54,120
It's a dance thing, all right.

1111
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,370
It's a competition thing at
the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.

1112
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,385
Tommy would never do it with me
and I missed it every single year.

1113
00:56:58,542 --> 00:56:59,556
Well, Tommy's dead, so he's
not gonna fucking do it.

1114
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:02,385
Would you please! I don't
have a filter when I talk.

1115
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,135
Can we have one conversation
without you reminding me that my

1116
00:57:04,293 --> 00:57:05,073
goddamn husband is dead?

1117
00:57:05,245 --> 00:57:06,225
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

1118
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,842
But I can only do it if I have a
partner... and now I'm about to miss

1119
00:57:11,953 --> 00:57:12,239
it for another year.

1120
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:14,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not
gonna fuckin' dance with you.

1121
00:57:14,468 --> 00:57:15,230
What are you talking about?

1122
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:19,045
What, your schedule is so busy?
"Grapes of Wrath" and watching

1123
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,100
football with your dad?

1124
00:57:20,247 --> 00:57:21,625
Tiffany, I'm not gonna
do a dance with you.

1125
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:22,855
All right, then I'm not
giving her your fucking letter.

1126
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,030
Wait a second! But you
promised you would do this.

1127
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:26,370
Think about it.

1128
00:57:28,252 --> 00:57:30,126
Well, I already did do
something for you, you know.

1129
00:57:32,267 --> 00:57:34,075
I took care of that jerkoff
that was in front of your house.

1130
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,110
What? Jordie?

1131
00:57:35,437 --> 00:57:37,195
Let me ask you something. Do
you call him when you're lonely?

1132
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,455
That encourages him,
Tiffany. You shouldn't do it.

1133
00:57:41,775 --> 00:57:43,057
Couldn't you say the
same about you and Nikki?

1134
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:44,655
It's not at all like me and Nikki.

1135
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:46,345
What are you talking about?
We're in love and we're married.

1136
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:47,400
It's completely different.

1137
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:52,125
How are you in love? Tell me
about that. The big Nikki love.

1138
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:54,427
Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.

1139
00:57:56,046 --> 00:57:58,093
We have a very unconventional
chemistry, it makes people feel

1140
00:57:58,128 --> 00:58:01,318
awkward, but not me. She's the most
beautiful woman I've ever been with.

1141
00:58:02,034 --> 00:58:04,673
Wow. It's electric between us,

1142
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:07,549
Okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other,
but that's normal, couples wanna do that,

1143
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:10,652
I want her to stop dressing
like she dresses, I want her to

1144
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:13,386
stop acting so superior to me,
okay? And she wanted me to lose

1145
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:17,250
weight and stop my mood
swings, both of which I've done.

1146
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:20,123
I mean, people fight. Couples fight.
We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a

1147
00:58:20,273 --> 00:58:23,070
couple weeks. That's normal. She
always wanted the best for me.

1148
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:26,392
She wanted me to be passionate and
compassionate. And that's a good

1149
00:58:26,528 --> 00:58:29,191
thing. You know? I just, look,
I'm my best self today, and I think

1150
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,938
she's her best self today, and our
love's gonna be fucking amazing.

1151
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:34,885
It's gonna be amazing, and you're
gonna be amazing, and she's gonna

1152
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,195
be amazing, and you're not gonna
be that guy that's gonna take

1153
00:58:37,344 --> 00:58:39,179
advantage of a situation without
offering to do something back.

1154
00:58:39,758 --> 00:58:42,725
So think about the dance thing.

1155
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:51,833
Danny, you're out of the hospital?
And you're here on game day?

1156
00:58:52,058 --> 00:58:56,028
I'm out. It's official, man.
They didn't convert me to my

1157
00:58:56,198 --> 00:59:00,413
Mental Hygiene Law admission status
within two thirds of the maximum length

1158
00:59:00,558 --> 00:59:03,771
of my felony sentence, so I'm
out. They had to let me go.

1159
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:06,153
I never understand what he's saying.

1160
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:08,444
Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on,
let's come back and sit down the

1161
00:59:08,584 --> 00:59:09,350
way you were before.

1162
00:59:10,404 --> 00:59:13,594
What a treat! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dad's got you sitting here?

1163
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:15,591
Oh, yeah. He calls me
"Jailhouse Lawyer. "

1164
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:17,893
Hold the remote the way
you were holding it before.

1165
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,423
Okay. And now you're holding the remote?

1166
00:59:19,866 --> 00:59:21,302
And it's working. Your dad's a genius.

1167
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:25,141
Now sit up. And Danny's
the good luck charm?

1168
00:59:25,516 --> 00:59:27,883
Danny's from you. This is your
house, so it comes down to you.

1169
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:29,998
You're the one. Yeah,
you're the one, Pat.

1170
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,843
Superstition, Danny. I don't know.

1171
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:32,632
Come sit down.

1172
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,468
Don't disappear doing God knows
what with that Tiffany Maxwell.

1173
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:38,398
Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my
friend. Why would you say that?

1174
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:41,516
Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be
careful. She goes to a lot of therapy.

1175
00:59:41,938 --> 00:59:44,376
I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.
What are you trying to say?

1176
00:59:44,745 --> 00:59:45,778
I'm just saying
- Am I messed up?

1177
00:59:46,355 --> 00:59:48,943
Why don't you stop judging people?
You judge everybody. You're the one

1178
00:59:49,093 --> 00:59:49,959
who has a messed up marriage.

1179
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:51,552
I'm just looking out for you, I'm just
looking out for you. She's unstable.

1180
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:52,837
What's wrong with your marriage?
What's wrong with your marriage?

1181
00:59:52,983 --> 00:59:53,464
Nothing's wrong!

1182
00:59:53,634 --> 00:59:56,319
You should have seen when I was at his
house. It's like a circus over there.

1183
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,474
Shh, shh. What are you talking
about? I'm not gonna hide this.

1184
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:00,320
You need to deal with it.
Stop breaking my balls.

1185
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:03,963
Oh! I got you an iPod.
Whoa! Is this for me?

1186
01:00:04,107 --> 01:00:05,817
Yeah. Well, that's my old iPod, but-

1187
01:00:05,932 --> 01:00:08,494
Oh, buddy, thank you.
That's so nice of you. Wow.

1188
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:11,443
Thirty-two gigabytes. How many
songs is that? Seven thousand.

1189
01:00:12,549 --> 01:00:14,756
Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers.
You love The Stranglers.

1190
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,361
Oh, the Sex Pistols. The
Clash. Got some Clash.

1191
01:00:18,853 --> 01:00:22,099
Oh, "West Side Story. " Yeah, "West
Side Story. " It makes me peaceful.

1192
01:00:22,254 --> 01:00:24,413
"Maria, I just met a girl named
Maria... " Right, right, right.

1193
01:00:24,562 --> 01:00:27,194
And then when I'm angry, which
is a lot these days, I go to the

1194
01:00:27,343 --> 01:00:38,464
garage... Metallica... Megadeth.
I start fucking smashing shit.

1195
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:39,564
You gotta get your marriage together.

1196
01:00:39,714 --> 01:00:43,101
I start breaking shit,
and I hurt my hand. And -

1197
01:00:43,234 --> 01:00:46,503
Ronnie, that's fucked up. Yeah,
but it makes me feel better.

1198
01:00:47,306 --> 01:00:48,359
It's like my therapy, you know?

1199
01:00:48,859 --> 01:00:51,569
When I'm with Nikki, I'm never
gonna do stuff like that...

1200
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:53,289
Whoa, Nikki? What's
all this about Nikki?

1201
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,748
Pan from the framed photo of Jake on
foyer wall, to Jake on the stairs above.

1202
01:00:57,948 --> 01:01:01,059
A restraining order is nothing to fool
with, bro. Holy shit, look at you! You

1203
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:04,356
are fit! You look absolutely
amazing. You feel good?

1204
01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:07,459
How you doing, Jake? Good. You look
like Schwarzenegger in his prime.

1205
01:01:07,604 --> 01:01:10,174
Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?

1206
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:14,829
So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't
come see you down at the hospital.

1207
01:01:15,674 --> 01:01:18,823
You know how those places creep me
out, and the firm's been expanding.

1208
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:20,943
I've been helping Pop with the
restaurant 'cause he needs to have

1209
01:01:21,092 --> 01:01:23,989
a legitimate business. He needs a
tax return. With all the money that

1210
01:01:23,999 --> 01:01:26,014
he's making with his bookmaking,
they're gonna come after him. And

1211
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,720
then it looks like I'm making,
I'm gonna make partner at the firm.

1212
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:34,037
Well, I don't even know what to say
to you anymore. You lost your wife,

1213
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:38,834
I'm getting engaged, and I wanna
be able to tell you about those kind

1214
01:01:39,003 --> 01:01:44,839
of things. You lost your house, I'm
getting a new house. You lost your

1215
01:01:44,979 --> 01:01:47,189
job, things are going
great for me at the firm.

1216
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:50,075
Maybe stop talking about all the
stuff that's good for you and bad

1217
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:53,382
for him. Just, you know, leave
it alone. We're watching the game.

1218
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:56,116
You know what, I'm just gonna,
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop

1219
01:01:56,256 --> 01:01:57,704
talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth.

1220
01:02:02,494 --> 01:02:12,064
As my friend Danny would say I got
nothing but love for you, brother.

1221
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:19,377
That's right. That's right.
That's nice. That's nice.

1222
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:25,949
Well, thank God, finally.
DeSean Jackson. Yeah. Did it fit?

1223
01:02:26,574 --> 01:02:27,938
I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.

1224
01:02:28,436 --> 01:02:29,764
Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.

1225
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:32,565
Veronica didn't like it.
Veronica hates the jersey.

1226
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,924
Whatever you do, watch out for
that restraining order, okay?

1227
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,321
Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.

1228
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:41,643
Pat, you're up to something, I know.

1229
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:45,069
People like Tiffany, or Danny, or
me, maybe we know something that

1230
01:02:45,214 --> 01:02:47,282
you guys don't know, okay? Did
you ever think about that? Maybe we

1231
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,641
understand something
because we're more-

1232
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,508
We have a sixth sense. I mean,
everybody's got it. Everybody's

1233
01:02:50,637 --> 01:02:51,429
just not in touch with it.

1234
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:54,033
Oh, no. How you doing, Pat? Jesus.

1235
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,879
I guess his sixth sense forgot
to tell him the cops were coming.

1236
01:02:57,904 --> 01:02:59,349
I'm taking him back to the hospital.

1237
01:02:59,716 --> 01:03:00,857
What? No, no, he
passed his thing, right?

1238
01:03:01,371 --> 01:03:03,466
First of all, check with
the latest legal development.

1239
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:07,744
Well, we got a call that they did
convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law

1240
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:09,949
admission status by the
deadline of your sentence, so...

1241
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:12,839
Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles
fan or are you not an Eagles fan?

1242
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:14,299
I'm an Eagles fan.

1243
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:17,769
Well then, what's the problem? He's
not goin' anywhere. Just let him

1244
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:19,812
finish the game, that's all. The
handkerchief is working. We're

1245
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:21,708
killing the Seahawks, twenty-seventen.

1246
01:03:22,317 --> 01:03:24,855
What's the matter with
you? Let him stay, please!

1247
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,207
I don't know what the hell you're
talking about "the handkerchief".

1248
01:03:28,057 --> 01:03:30,795
And I'm glad that the Seahawks
are losing and we're winning, but I

1249
01:03:30,925 --> 01:03:34,868
gotta take Danny McDaniels back to
Baltimore, alright? He can contest

1250
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:36,037
his case from Baltimore.

1251
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:39,770
Not correct about the Mental
Hygiene Law. You're not correct.

1252
01:03:40,573 --> 01:03:42,564
Come on. You guys oughta
be ashamed of yourselves.

1253
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:04,382
I used the insurance money to build
this. I designed it. All the floors

1254
01:04:04,648 --> 01:04:07,897
are hard oak. It has good
bounce for dancers. Wow.

1255
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,802
I'm not that great of a dancer,
but who cares? It's therapy and it's

1256
01:04:10,952 --> 01:04:14,484
fun. And the walls are good
'cause I can play music really loud

1257
01:04:14,678 --> 01:04:16,902
without anybody hearing.
Where do you sleep?

1258
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:21,626
Upstairs. It's a garage, I just
renovated it. You know, I was

1259
01:04:21,876 --> 01:04:23,307
thinking about putting
a ballet barre here.

1260
01:04:23,477 --> 01:04:24,172
When are you gonna give it to her?

1261
01:04:24,347 --> 01:04:28,032
What?

1262
01:04:28,067 --> 01:04:29,267
The letter to Nikki.

1263
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,703
Probably tonight. Really?

1264
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:35,432
Ronnie and Veronica and I
are gonna see her tonight.

1265
01:04:36,287 --> 01:04:38,337
Oh, I actually changed the first
paragraph. I did this thing about

1266
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:39,871
Shakespeare and how it's very romantic-

1267
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:41,044
Mm-hmm. -and that
maybe in the future if

1268
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:44,108
she wanted to go dancing, I can be
able to do that because of all the

1269
01:04:44,246 --> 01:04:45,547
training that-No, that's
good, that's really good.

1270
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:46,617
I assume you're a good teacher.

1271
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:47,929
Yeah. I mean, I hope so.

1272
01:04:48,037 --> 01:04:48,957
Maybe you can teach us
both, you know what I mean?

1273
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:52,322
And I also mentioned how generous
it is, what I'm doing for you.

1274
01:04:52,467 --> 01:04:54,170
Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.

1275
01:04:54,555 --> 01:04:55,322
You know, being of service.

1276
01:04:55,922 --> 01:04:56,682
Yeah. To your need. Uh-huh.

1277
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,532
All right, let's start simple. Start
at that corner, walk towards me.

1278
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:02,008
Walk across the room.

1279
01:05:03,517 --> 01:05:05,190
Can we do something else
besides the dance deal?

1280
01:05:05,407 --> 01:05:06,029
Are you fucking kidding me?

1281
01:05:06,171 --> 01:05:08,158
I'm good with a hammer. You want me
to fix something? A deal is a deal.

1282
01:05:08,365 --> 01:05:12,189
I know. Okay. I was just suggesting
that maybe there's a better scenario.

1283
01:05:12,424 --> 01:05:19,043
Why don't you walk
towards me like I'm Nikki.

1284
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:24,988
And the only way to convey how much you've
missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk.

1285
01:05:25,074 --> 01:05:28,049
You can't talk. Only walk.

1286
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:31,605
I'm not doing it. Do
it. No. That's stupid.

1287
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:36,213
No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm
Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.

1288
01:05:36,373 --> 01:05:38,894
You're not Nikki.

1289
01:05:41,094 --> 01:05:44,094
Don't look up until you're halfway here.

1290
01:05:57,099 --> 01:05:59,481
Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion.

1291
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:00,939
I don't feel anything.

1292
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:07,539
Has anybody ever told
you how Tommy died?

1293
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,276
We were married for three years and

1294
01:06:14,461 --> 01:06:18,021
five days, and I loved him. But
for the last couple months, I just

1295
01:06:18,186 --> 01:06:23,368
wasn't into sex at all. It just
felt like we were so different and

1296
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:26,941
I was depressed. Some of that is
just me, some of it was he wanted

1297
01:06:27,076 --> 01:06:29,918
me to have kids and I have a hard
enough time taking care of myself.

1298
01:06:30,411 --> 01:06:37,491
I don't think that makes me a
criminal. Anyway one night after

1299
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:44,071
dinner, he drove to Victoria's
Secret at King of Prussia Mall and

1300
01:06:44,297 --> 01:06:47,994
got some lingerie to get something
going. And on the way back, he

1301
01:06:48,154 --> 01:06:50,992
stopped on 76 to help a guy with
a flat tire and he got hit by a car

1302
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:56,021
and killed. And the Victoria's
Secret box was still in the front

1303
01:06:56,151 --> 01:07:02,674
seat. That's a feeling.

1304
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:53,264
Whoa! Slow down. What?

1305
01:09:53,331 --> 01:09:57,633
Your father wanted you to have this.

1306
01:09:57,835 --> 01:09:58,834
He wants me to have
- all this Eagles information.

1307
01:09:59,614 --> 01:10:03,185
It's his living. Um, tell Dad thanks.

1308
01:10:03,608 --> 01:10:06,031
Your father expects to
spend time with you, Pat.

1309
01:10:13,264 --> 01:10:16,126
Football stays out of this place,
so does "Lord of the Flies. "

1310
01:10:16,904 --> 01:10:19,381
Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are
you doing? I'm behind on my syllabus.

1311
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:22,688
I don't give a fuck. What the
hell are you doing? Hey, hey!

1312
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:24,990
Did you just throw that outside?

1313
01:10:25,819 --> 01:10:28,614
What? You're not gonna read that
shit on my time. I can tell you all

1314
01:10:28,749 --> 01:10:32,108
about the "Lord of the Flies. "
It's a bunch of boys on an island and

1315
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:35,190
they have a conch... they have a
shell ... and whoever has the conch

1316
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:37,732
has the power and they can talk.
And if you don't have the conch,

1317
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,387
then you don't have the power. And
then there's a little chubby boy,

1318
01:10:40,811 --> 01:10:43,303
and they call him Piggy and they're
really mean, and then there's a

1319
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:47,436
murder. I mean, humanity is just
nasty and there's no silver lining.

1320
01:10:48,206 --> 01:10:51,478
Wow. That was a great synopsis.
I still need to read it, though.

1321
01:10:51,645 --> 01:10:56,820
Who's that? What the...?
What are you doing here, man?

1322
01:10:57,681 --> 01:11:00,551
If one of your two supervising
physicians loses their license,

1323
01:11:01,161 --> 01:11:03,244
then your whole
ajudication is thrown out.

1324
01:11:03,519 --> 01:11:04,102
How'd you know we were here?

1325
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:05,969
I went by your parents' house
looking for you and they told me

1326
01:11:06,105 --> 01:11:06,708
you was over here.

1327
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,020
Danny, this is Tiffany.
Tiffany, this is Danny.

1328
01:11:08,178 --> 01:11:11,268
Hello. Pat told me about you. So
is the girl, that you wrote about?

1329
01:11:11,721 --> 01:11:14,255
Yeah. What? He wrote
about me? I'm "the girl"?

1330
01:11:14,511 --> 01:11:16,502
He wrote about you, all
right. What'd he say?

1331
01:11:17,062 --> 01:11:19,702
He said you guys was helping each
other out and you were nice and had

1332
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:24,652
a mouth on you, that
you were mouthy, but-

1333
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:25,472
Whoa, whoa, that's enough.

1334
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:27,152
No, please, tell me more about
what he said in the letter.

1335
01:11:27,297 --> 01:11:28,754
Yeah, anything you wanna know,
I'll just tell you. It was nothing.

1336
01:11:28,926 --> 01:11:30,063
It was just a very general letter.

1337
01:11:30,193 --> 01:11:34,068
Cool. She's fine. She is
my friend with an "F. "

1338
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:36,820
A capital "F. " For "friend. "

1339
01:11:36,969 --> 01:11:40,257
Hey, can I see what you guys are doing?

1340
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:43,772
Yeah. Okay. That's it?

1341
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:51,616
Why? What is it, what is it, what is it.

1342
01:11:51,862 --> 01:11:53,193
Can I say something? Do you mind? No.

1343
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:54,676
You sure? Just say it. Say it.

1344
01:11:54,851 --> 01:11:57,628
No, please. I think Pat,
you should be facing Tiffany.

1345
01:11:59,052 --> 01:12:01,197
Let me show you, Pat, let me show
you what I mean. You gotta come at

1346
01:12:01,352 --> 01:12:02,734
her with a little bit more soul, man.

1347
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,807
You should move more hips.

1348
01:12:03,957 --> 01:12:06,106
Just, just sort of come in,
Pat, come in like this. And...

1349
01:12:06,245 --> 01:12:10,887
Okay. Yeah. Can you move 'em a
little bit more? Yeah, that's it.

1350
01:12:11,013 --> 01:12:12,161
Move 'em a bit more.

1351
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:16,027
You could turn around, too,
there's nothing wrong with that.

1352
01:12:16,487 --> 01:12:18,456
Yeah. You're pretty good. Mm, yeah.

1353
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:23,815
Okay, we got it, we got it. Okay. Okay.

1354
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:32,957
Come on, Pat, come on. A little
bit more soul. Black it up, Pat.

1355
01:12:32,992 --> 01:12:35,117
"Black it up"? You know
damn well what it means.

1356
01:12:36,822 --> 01:12:42,719
I got an idea. Come get
some, Pat. Come get some.

1357
01:12:57,027 --> 01:13:00,342
Shuffle back, shuffle back.
Shuffle back, shuffle back.

1358
01:13:00,472 --> 01:13:01,711
Girl, you gotta move your junk.

1359
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:05,854
I gotta get out of here. I
gotta go see this girl, Tanya.

1360
01:13:06,044 --> 01:13:06,912
She lives on this side of town.

1361
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:08,557
Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.

1362
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:10,308
Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be
there, man. I want you guys to win!

1363
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,103
Bye! Excelsior, Pat!

1364
01:13:12,448 --> 01:13:14,489
Excelsior! That's my man. Lets go!

1365
01:13:17,332 --> 01:13:20,952
Pat. Patty.

1366
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:45,300
Where have you been?

1367
01:13:45,335 --> 01:13:45,800
Huh?

1368
01:13:47,147 --> 01:13:48,518
We got a serious situation
on our hands, you know that.

1369
01:13:51,314 --> 01:13:55,622
We gotta beat the Giants if we
wanna have a chance of getting into

1370
01:13:55,797 --> 01:14:00,432
the division, any chance of playing
in the playoffs. Do you realize that?

1371
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:04,762
I didn't realize that. Yeah,
that's the bind we're in.

1372
01:14:06,547 --> 01:14:10,892
I mean, I think it would be wise
if we spent father-son time, reading

1373
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,132
about the Eagles, talking about
them, just to strengthen the good

1374
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:16,171
luck thing that you're in.

1375
01:14:18,027 --> 01:14:20,676
Okay. Yeah? Right. Hmm?

1376
01:14:36,044 --> 01:14:43,892
I just wanted to, maybe I didn't,
spend enough time with you growing

1377
01:14:44,072 --> 01:14:49,732
up. I spent too much time with
your brother. It might have made you

1378
01:14:49,889 --> 01:14:53,191
feel worse about your behavior,
but I didn't know anything, I didn't

1379
01:14:53,376 --> 01:14:55,282
know how to handle it.

1380
01:14:57,182 --> 01:14:58,500
I mean, that's what
all this Eagles stuff

1381
01:14:58,642 --> 01:15:08,763
is about. It's about us, spending
time now. I wanna do everything I

1382
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:13,140
can to help you get back on your
feet. That's the whole point. Yeah.

1383
01:15:17,982 --> 01:15:21,519
I wish you'd watch these games with me so
we could talk, we could get into things.

1384
01:15:23,054 --> 01:15:32,441
So would you, would
you just come downstairs

1385
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:34,339
and talk to me and Randy now?

1386
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:37,748
Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

1387
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,072
He's betting everything on
the Giant game. Everything.

1388
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:43,704
All the money that he needs for the
restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game.

1389
01:15:46,169 --> 01:15:50,899
Tell him why. Because he
believes in you. Is that true?

1390
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:56,209
I believe in you, Patty. I believe
in you. I want you to know that.

1391
01:15:57,064 --> 01:15:58,753
So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.

1392
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:01,169
You understand? Yeah.

1393
01:16:01,414 --> 01:16:04,439
Heavy. I want you to go to
the game with your brother.

1394
01:16:05,104 --> 01:16:06,779
You want me to go to the game with Jake?

1395
01:16:07,434 --> 01:16:08,735
Of course I do. Does he want me to go?

1396
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:10,231
Of course he wants you to go.

1397
01:16:10,473 --> 01:16:12,443
He told you that? He told me, yes.

1398
01:16:13,379 --> 01:16:16,179
Even with all his friends? With
all his friends. He trusts you.

1399
01:16:16,377 --> 01:16:17,164
He's not embarrassed?

1400
01:16:17,329 --> 01:16:20,109
No. I'd love to go to the game,
too, but as you know, I'm banned

1401
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:23,655
from the stadium. 'Cause I'd love
to see us beat the Giants and take

1402
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,099
a lot of money from this asshole.

1403
01:16:26,797 --> 01:16:31,066
Listen, personally, I think it's
a stupid bet. As a matter of fact,

1404
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:34,737
I think it's ridiculous to bet all
that dough for the restaurant on a game.

1405
01:16:35,565 --> 01:16:39,046
Randy. I just hope you heard
what I said. It's like a

1406
01:16:39,217 --> 01:16:44,329
family business, it's our family
endeavor. We all stick together on this.

1407
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:48,344
That's how it works. That's
a positive, positive vibe.

1408
01:16:51,427 --> 01:16:54,157
I made a commitment to Tiffany
about a project, and we have a very

1409
01:16:54,351 --> 01:16:57,699
important part of it that we
have to go over on Sunday, and

1410
01:17:02,373 --> 01:17:05,629
it's good for me, Dad. It's making
me disciplined and focused, and it's,

1411
01:17:05,849 --> 01:17:08,973
it's..., I never would've thought
this, but it's a good thing.

1412
01:17:09,849 --> 01:17:10,613
What is this thing you're doing?

1413
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:14,315
Yeah, what is it? What
is this project, hon?

1414
01:17:15,028 --> 01:17:19,789
It's a dance thing, okay? There's
nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.

1415
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:34,059
Listen, I need to ask you something.

1416
01:17:34,224 --> 01:17:36,365
Tomorrow can I spend half the day with
you and half the day at the Eagles game?

1417
01:17:36,828 --> 01:17:38,884
I'm gonna pretend that you
didn't just ask me that.

1418
01:17:39,393 --> 01:17:44,334
Why? These are the two days that
you have promised me and that we have

1419
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:46,481
prepared to nail the big
move. It's not ready yet.

1420
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:48,322
And we don't have a move yet.

1421
01:17:48,485 --> 01:17:50,879
I know, but my dad opened up to me
and it was really beautiful and I

1422
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:53,929
wanna be of service to him, okay?
And he's worried that the juju from

1423
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:56,354
the Eagles is being fucked up and
he's concerned that it's because

1424
01:17:56,499 --> 01:17:57,308
I'm spending time with you.

1425
01:17:57,482 --> 01:17:59,386
Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?

1426
01:17:59,861 --> 01:18:02,487
No, you're not messing up the juju,
but the juju is messed up because

1427
01:18:02,646 --> 01:18:03,691
I'm not with him during the games.

1428
01:18:05,355 --> 01:18:06,923
Guess what? What?

1429
01:18:07,123 --> 01:18:16,103
Nikki replied to your letter.
But you can't read it until after

1430
01:18:16,278 --> 01:18:17,984
you nail the big move. Go.

1431
01:18:38,128 --> 01:18:39,749
Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do
anything else without reading

1432
01:18:39,898 --> 01:18:41,758
Nikki's letter, okay? It's just...,
it's in the back of my head.

1433
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:43,181
We don't almost have it, all right?

1434
01:18:45,368 --> 01:18:47,408
I just hope you can
handle it. Thank you.

1435
01:18:49,334 --> 01:18:50,558
What was her energy
when she gave it to you?

1436
01:18:52,263 --> 01:18:55,286
She was intrigued, excited,
and a little scared.

1437
01:18:56,678 --> 01:18:59,253
She was scared? About
what? Did she tell you?

1438
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:04,791
Try to stay positive.

1439
01:19:08,946 --> 01:19:12,547
I'm just gonna read it out loud,
okay? Because if she says anything

1440
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:14,922
that's, you know, is
that too much to ask?

1441
01:19:15,258 --> 01:19:16,078
No.

1442
01:19:23,078 --> 01:19:25,400
I thought you were
gonna read it out loud.

1443
01:19:25,534 --> 01:19:26,663
Okay. Sorry.

1444
01:19:28,192 --> 01:19:29,911
"Dear Pat,

1445
01:19:31,311 --> 01:19:34,300
It was very emotional for
me to get your letter, as I'm

1446
01:19:34,476 --> 01:19:37,438
sure you can imagine, but I'm glad
you took the risk of discreetly

1447
01:19:37,585 --> 01:19:39,040
getting it to me through Tiffany.

1448
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:44,432
This gives us a chance to communicate while I
keep the restraining order until I feel safe.

1449
01:19:47,802 --> 01:19:50,603
I must admit you sound terrific
and I'm happy that you are

1450
01:19:50,763 --> 01:19:54,108
feeling so positive and becoming a
more loving and caring man, which I

1451
01:19:54,268 --> 01:19:56,518
always knew you were.

1452
01:20:12,018 --> 01:20:14,000
I was moved to read
about 'Excelsior' and your

1453
01:20:14,098 --> 01:20:16,888
belief in happy endings. I am also
moved by your act of love to read

1454
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:19,328
the books I have taught at the high
school. I'm sorry you find them so

1455
01:20:19,488 --> 01:20:21,423
negative, but I disagree. I think
they are great works of art that

1456
01:20:21,586 --> 01:20:24,218
reflect how hard life can be and
they can also help kids prepare

1457
01:20:24,378 --> 01:20:27,659
themselves for the hardness
of life. In spite of all these

1458
01:20:27,819 --> 01:20:30,459
positive developments, Pat, I
have to say if it's me reading the

1459
01:20:30,599 --> 01:20:34,517
signs, I need to see something to
prove you are ready to resume our

1460
01:20:34,652 --> 01:20:40,307
marriage. Otherwise I find myself
thinking that we might both be

1461
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:42,298
better off moving on
with our lives separately.

1462
01:20:49,898 --> 01:20:50,700
Please don't react quickly

1463
01:20:50,743 --> 01:20:54,898
to this, but take
time to think about it.

1464
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:57,043
I'm glad you're doing
so well. Love, Nikki. "

1465
01:21:09,536 --> 01:21:10,600
I think I'm done for today, okay?

1466
01:21:16,013 --> 01:21:18,268
She said to show her something,

1467
01:21:18,684 --> 01:21:21,934
Pat. This dance can be that
something. You would have never

1468
01:21:22,403 --> 01:21:25,783
done something like this in a
million years. It shows all kinds

1469
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:28,881
of skills on so many different
levels: focus, collaboration,

1470
01:21:29,123 --> 01:21:36,948
discipline. It's romantic, like
I said it would be. It's for her.

1471
01:21:39,773 --> 01:21:42,528
Thanks for the letter.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

1472
01:21:56,038 --> 01:21:58,088
Can I use your phone?
Is it an emergency?

1473
01:21:58,453 --> 01:22:00,553
Yeah, kind of. What kind of emergency?

1474
01:22:02,424 --> 01:22:04,975
Well, I'm just doing this project
with Tiffany and I wanted to tell

1475
01:22:05,134 --> 01:22:06,049
her I'm not gonna be on time.

1476
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:09,356
Just don't make her an emergency,
that crazy girl, you know?

1477
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:13,618
She's not crazy... I'll just borrow
Jake's phone. It's too bad you

1478
01:22:13,788 --> 01:22:16,463
can't come in to the stadium, but I
know you were kicked out, you know,

1479
01:22:16,658 --> 01:22:20,228
for beating everybody up. Guess
we're not that different, huh, Dad?

1480
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:23,517
That a bad thing?

1481
01:22:24,253 --> 01:22:26,123
No, I think, it's a good thing.

1482
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:29,848
Don't drink too much. Don't
hit anybody. You'll be fine.

1483
01:22:30,228 --> 01:22:31,380
Yeah. I'm solid.

1484
01:22:39,241 --> 01:22:40,153
This is my little brother Pat.

1485
01:22:40,658 --> 01:22:41,259
Hey, how you doing?

1486
01:22:41,409 --> 01:22:43,618
So, Pat, what's this I hear
about you just gettin' out?

1487
01:22:43,763 --> 01:22:46,233
Yeah, from the looney bin!

1488
01:22:46,794 --> 01:22:49,633
What the fuck?! I talked
to you about that already!

1489
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:52,493
I told you guys
- It's all right.

1490
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:54,496
Huh? No. It's alright.

1491
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:56,083
He's a good dude! He's a good dude.

1492
01:22:57,708 --> 01:23:01,338
Oh, shit! The Asian invasion!

1493
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:04,533
They're here every week! No!

1494
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:17,231
Uh, Jake you better get your brother.

1495
01:23:17,355 --> 01:23:20,543
Cuckoo bird's takin' off. Doctor Patel!

1496
01:23:22,294 --> 01:23:25,956
Pat! Hey! What are you doing here?

1497
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:27,843
You know, we must beat
the Giants, my brother.

1498
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:28,963
I'm not supposed to be seeing you,

1499
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:30,438
right? Outside the office?

1500
01:23:30,823 --> 01:23:32,168
Pat, Pat. That's illegal!

1501
01:23:32,393 --> 01:23:35,804
Pat, today I'm your brother in
green, not your therapist. I'm so

1502
01:23:35,949 --> 01:23:38,365
happy to see you. How
wonderful that you are here!

1503
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,218
Hey, Jake this is Cliff.
This is my doctor, Cliff.

1504
01:23:40,843 --> 01:23:43,044
Look, two things. We gotta watch
that bubble screen for fuckin'

1505
01:23:43,183 --> 01:23:45,810
Manning in the backfield and
we gotta make sure we knock the

1506
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:47,538
receivers on their ass
on the line of scrimmage.

1507
01:23:47,873 --> 01:23:49,828
You can say that again.
Those cocksuckers!

1508
01:24:20,006 --> 01:24:22,328
Okay, you know what? I don't have
her phone number. If you want, if

1509
01:24:22,514 --> 01:24:25,451
you really want, you can call
Veronica 'cause she does, but I

1510
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:26,738
don't want to talk to Veronica.

1511
01:24:26,888 --> 01:24:27,718
Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?

1512
01:24:27,848 --> 01:24:30,173
Because she brings me down,
man! She just brings me down.

1513
01:24:30,488 --> 01:24:31,609
You have to change. You're not
gonna throw the marriage away.

1514
01:24:31,758 --> 01:24:33,628
There's some kind of love
there. I know, I used to see it.

1515
01:24:33,763 --> 01:24:36,623
You guys have a beautiful thing
that got broken somewhere along the

1516
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:37,978
line and you gotta fix
it like a chiropractor.

1517
01:24:38,143 --> 01:24:39,883
You gotta give it a
chiropractic adjustment.

1518
01:24:40,668 --> 01:24:43,918
Enough with awkwardness! I don't
wanna walk in your house and not be

1519
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:45,098
able to say what I wanna say.

1520
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,989
You're right, man. You're
right, you're right,

1521
01:24:48,071 --> 01:24:54,249
Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go!
What the fuck? What's that smell?

1522
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,508
Nasty Indian curry! This is America,
baby! Go back to your country!

1523
01:25:00,432 --> 01:25:02,239
What, what's wrong? Hey!

1524
01:25:02,673 --> 01:25:06,933
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
Stay back, Pat. Stay back.

1525
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:11,418
Leave the fucking Indians
alone. Stay here, stay here!

1526
01:25:12,223 --> 01:25:14,133
I'm not gonna go anywhere.
Don't get in a fight!

1527
01:25:16,348 --> 01:25:18,195
I'm not gonna fight.
I'm not gonna fight.

1528
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,075
Hey, not my brother! Hey, hey, hey!

1529
01:25:27,178 --> 01:25:30,038
Break it up or you'll be arrested!

1530
01:25:49,843 --> 01:25:54,779
What'd you do? What happened? Dad-

1531
01:25:55,194 --> 01:25:56,131
What the fuck happened? Dad.

1532
01:25:56,301 --> 01:25:59,709
The birds lose, I lose a fuckin'
fortune, a fortune to Randy!

1533
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:02,683
What the fuck did you
do?! You fucking lost it!

1534
01:26:02,853 --> 01:26:05,158
I thought you said you had
it together! You were solid!

1535
01:26:05,523 --> 01:26:07,183
I am solid. I was
solid at the game, Dad.

1536
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,513
I'm solid, I'm solid now.

1537
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,773
You fell apart! What are
you fucking talking about?!

1538
01:26:10,913 --> 01:26:11,583
Your son was trying to-

1539
01:26:11,778 --> 01:26:14,111
It's all fucking ruined
now. It's all ruined.

1540
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,808
No, Dad! It's all fucking ruined
now! It's all fucking ruined!

1541
01:26:17,278 --> 01:26:18,358
No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!

1542
01:26:18,518 --> 01:26:20,427
It's all ruined, you
little fucking shit!

1543
01:26:20,566 --> 01:26:21,753
No, Dad! I didn't do a
fucking thing! Come on, Dad!

1544
01:26:21,953 --> 01:26:24,015
You loser! You loser!

1545
01:26:24,176 --> 01:26:26,153
I'm not a loser.

1546
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:28,793
You fucking loser!
You ruined everything!

1547
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:29,458
He was defending his brother!

1548
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:33,542
You fucking idiot! You spike
the ball on the one yard line,

1549
01:26:36,093 --> 01:26:37,251
Who is this?! Who's this?!

1550
01:26:38,021 --> 01:26:40,468
We need to talk right now! When
you make a serious commitment to

1551
01:26:40,623 --> 01:26:41,978
somebody, it is not cool to not show up!

1552
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,618
Wait a second, I tried to
call, my God, what's happening,

1553
01:26:44,793 --> 01:26:47,198
I called..., but I tried
to call you, Tiffany, I-

1554
01:26:48,338 --> 01:26:49,008
Oh, really? Yes.

1555
01:26:49,153 --> 01:26:50,688
I told you I was gonna split my
time with my dad and you, and my

1556
01:26:50,828 --> 01:26:52,969
dad was pulling me in one
direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie-

1557
01:26:53,109 --> 01:26:56,603
Well, that sounds great, Pat.
That's great for all of them, but

1558
01:26:56,738 --> 01:26:59,218
all of them didn't make a commitment
to me in return for my help.

1559
01:27:02,848 --> 01:27:04,048
I'm Tiffany, by the way.

1560
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:09,508
What is this craziness
with Tiffany Maxwell?

1561
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:10,863
There's no craziness.
I told you who she was,

1562
01:27:11,108 --> 01:27:12,967
I was doing this thing with
her. We had a conversation!

1563
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:14,718
She's fucking nuts! When you
started spending time with her,

1564
01:27:14,868 --> 01:27:17,383
it all fell apart. This is
the fucking reason right here.

1565
01:27:17,773 --> 01:27:19,740
You think I fucked up the
Eagles' juju, don't you?

1566
01:27:20,117 --> 01:27:22,504
Ever since, ever since he
was with you, ever since-

1567
01:27:22,644 --> 01:27:24,913
You think that I'm why today's happened?

1568
01:27:25,277 --> 01:27:26,589
That's right, you are
why today happened.

1569
01:27:26,733 --> 01:27:27,868
I'm the reason why today happened?

1570
01:27:28,203 --> 01:27:29,433
I think so. Let's talk about that.

1571
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:30,751
Be my guest.

1572
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:34,038
The first night that Pat and I met
at my sister's, the Eagles beat the

1573
01:27:34,173 --> 01:27:37,718
Forty Niners handily, forty to
twenty-six. The second time we got

1574
01:27:37,846 --> 01:27:40,743
together we went for a run and the
Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to

1575
01:27:40,884 --> 01:27:41,753
five in the NLCS.

1576
01:27:42,547 --> 01:27:43,086
She's right, Dad.

1577
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:46,958
The next time we went for a run
the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-

1578
01:27:47,168 --> 01:27:48,033
seven to fourteen.

1579
01:27:48,418 --> 01:27:48,809
Wow.

1580
01:27:49,054 --> 01:27:51,958
The third time we got together we
had Raisin Bran in the diner and

1581
01:27:52,088 --> 01:27:55,097
the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay
in the fourth game of the World

1582
01:27:55,227 --> 01:27:56,200
Series, ten to two.

1583
01:27:56,349 --> 01:27:57,078
Oh, wow.

1584
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:59,663
Let me think about that. Wait a minute.

1585
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:02,516
Well, why don't you think about
when the Eagles beat the Seahawks,

1586
01:28:02,663 --> 01:28:03,520
fourteen to seven.

1587
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:06,256
He was with you? He was
with me. We went for a run.

1588
01:28:06,778 --> 01:28:07,526
Really? That's crazy.

1589
01:28:07,665 --> 01:28:10,172
There have been no games since Pat
and I have been rehearsing every

1590
01:28:10,297 --> 01:28:13,823
day and if Pat had been with
me like he was supposed to, he

1591
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:16,273
wouldn't have gotten in a fight,
he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the

1592
01:28:16,429 --> 01:28:17,833
Eagles beat the New York Giants.

1593
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,568
She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
That's all right on all counts.

1594
01:28:24,948 --> 01:28:27,880
Does anybody here happen to know
what the official motto of the

1595
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,145
state of New York is on the official
seal of the State of New York?

1596
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:34,105
Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know?

1597
01:28:34,115 --> 01:28:38,923
"Excelsior. " Look it up.
Yeah, "Excelsior. " Oh Pat.

1598
01:28:39,986 --> 01:28:43,008
Not that I give a fuck
about football or about your

1599
01:28:43,138 --> 01:28:46,072
superstitions, but if it's me
reading the signs, I don't send the

1600
01:28:46,207 --> 01:28:50,641
Eagles guy whose personal motto is
"Excelsior, " to a fucking Giants

1601
01:28:50,878 --> 01:28:53,950
game, especially when he's
already in a legal situation.

1602
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:57,623
Unbelievable. Wow. How did
you know all that stuff?

1603
01:28:58,463 --> 01:29:03,978
I did my research. Well,
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

1604
01:29:04,402 --> 01:29:05,029
Thank you.

1605
01:29:06,372 --> 01:29:11,039
I gotta rethink this whole
thing. I didn't trust it before,

1606
01:29:11,264 --> 01:29:12,524
but I gotta say, now I do.

1607
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:17,773
Oh, now you like her, Dad?
I have to say I do. Yup.

1608
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:23,634
Patrizio, I feel terrible, you
know? You made the bet, I won a lot

1609
01:29:23,848 --> 01:29:26,547
of money, and now look, your
whole family is in turmoil.

1610
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:30,693
Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.
You live for this shit. You've been

1611
01:29:30,838 --> 01:29:32,293
betting against my father for years.

1612
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:33,399
Is that right?

1613
01:29:33,544 --> 01:29:35,343
You're twisting the knife
right now. You get off on it!

1614
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,163
That's bullshit! That's
not true! Don't say that!

1615
01:29:37,314 --> 01:29:38,204
You get off on it! If not,
then prove it. Prove it.

1616
01:29:38,442 --> 01:29:39,538
Yeah, prove it, prove it!

1617
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:42,597
How do you want me to prove
it? How's he gonna prove it?

1618
01:29:42,755 --> 01:29:47,296
By giving them the chance to win
back everything, double or nothing.

1619
01:29:47,446 --> 01:29:48,823
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1620
01:29:49,068 --> 01:29:51,748
Double or nothing on the Bengals,
next week? Is that what you're saying?

1621
01:29:59,083 --> 01:29:59,773
Against the Cowboys.

1622
01:29:59,918 --> 01:30:04,178
That's your team isn't
it, Randy? That's his team!

1623
01:30:04,338 --> 01:30:08,104
I know who his team
is. When is the game?

1624
01:30:08,675 --> 01:30:10,638
December twenty-eight,
last game of the season.

1625
01:30:11,289 --> 01:30:12,779
Oh, my God. Same day
as the Benjamin Franklin

1626
01:30:12,956 --> 01:30:15,255
Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.

1627
01:30:15,915 --> 01:30:18,401
Oh God. Randy, I thought
they were America's Team.

1628
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:19,627
Don't you believe in America's Team?

1629
01:30:19,855 --> 01:30:21,364
Yeah, Randy, don't you
believe in America's Team?

1630
01:30:22,193 --> 01:30:25,962
Yeah, I believe in America's Team
but if I win that bet, I win your

1631
01:30:26,135 --> 01:30:30,083
book, you're out of action, you
get no restaurant, no nothing.

1632
01:30:31,255 --> 01:30:34,480
I like it. No. No, Patrizio-

1633
01:30:34,806 --> 01:30:36,273
I believe in the Eagles,
I believe in my son,

1634
01:30:36,418 --> 01:30:37,688
I'll take the action. I'll take it.

1635
01:30:38,093 --> 01:30:40,408
Dad! Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!

1636
01:30:40,713 --> 01:30:43,081
I have faith, I have faith.
Excelsior belongs in this house-

1637
01:30:43,673 --> 01:30:45,987
Dad
- ... not in the State of New York. In this house.

1638
01:30:46,463 --> 01:30:48,443
Dad, listen to me. I didn't know
that "Excelsior" was the state

1639
01:30:48,583 --> 01:30:49,343
motto of New York, okay?

1640
01:30:49,503 --> 01:30:50,464
I didn't know, either, but now I know.

1641
01:30:50,594 --> 01:30:52,869
I know, but listen to me, this
is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is

1642
01:30:53,005 --> 01:30:54,318
toxic, you shouldn't be doing
this, you shouldn't be doing-

1643
01:30:54,443 --> 01:30:55,663
Randy, what do you say...

1644
01:30:55,813 --> 01:30:57,072
Be quiet, shut up. You already
did enough. Randy, what do you say?

1645
01:30:57,402 --> 01:31:01,019
My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team
favored by one and a half points.

1646
01:31:01,144 --> 01:31:01,828
I'll give you three more.

1647
01:31:02,163 --> 01:31:05,484
Patrizio, stop it! And
Randy, don't you take the bet!

1648
01:31:05,878 --> 01:31:09,133
In fact, I'll give you
ten points. No, Dad! Dad!

1649
01:31:09,558 --> 01:31:15,275
Dad! You have to take
that bet on the Cowboys.

1650
01:31:15,623 --> 01:31:16,727
Dolores, would you stop him? Jesus!

1651
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:20,289
How could you not take that bet?
Even with the ten points I give

1652
01:31:20,469 --> 01:31:23,271
you, that's an insane spread
to your advantage. Cowboys are

1653
01:31:23,396 --> 01:31:26,823
cowards. And I'll bet you're such
a coward, you won't take the ten.

1654
01:31:27,383 --> 01:31:30,136
Plus, are you listening, plus
whatever their score is at the

1655
01:31:30,277 --> 01:31:31,593
dance thing. What's that?
Tiffany, what's that?

1656
01:31:32,096 --> 01:31:34,283
What? No, no, no, no. You're
crazy to give away that many

1657
01:31:34,423 --> 01:31:36,496
points. That's ridiculous!
I won't take that!

1658
01:31:36,673 --> 01:31:42,848
However, wait a second. I
do like the idea of a parlay.

1659
01:31:43,253 --> 01:31:48,628
What? No parlay! No! No,
don't do it. Don't do it.

1660
01:31:49,253 --> 01:31:51,176
Pat, how do they run
this dance competition?

1661
01:31:51,853 --> 01:31:53,274
I mean, how do they
score it and everything?

1662
01:31:53,638 --> 01:31:55,828
I don't know, I don't know how they
fucking score! We're participating.

1663
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:58,042
We're not, we're not a part of it.
There are people, this is a high-

1664
01:31:58,162 --> 01:32:01,508
end dance contest. I don't know.
Do not put it as part of the parlay,

1665
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:03,092
Randy. Don't
- They go by the Philadelphia rules.

1666
01:32:05,283 --> 01:32:07,981
Each dancer is scored on a scale of
one to ten, ten being the highest.

1667
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:09,363
You have to average
the four judges' scores.

1668
01:32:10,185 --> 01:32:13,863
Okay, score is from one to ten,
right? And you guys are how good?

1669
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:16,728
We suck. We don't
suck. Pat's a beginner,

1670
01:32:16,953 --> 01:32:19,059
I'm okay, we're happy
just to be going there.

1671
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:21,078
And how are the people
you're competing against?

1672
01:32:21,293 --> 01:32:23,247
They're good. Some of
them are professionals.

1673
01:32:23,703 --> 01:32:26,393
They're good? Better
than you? A lot better.

1674
01:32:27,093 --> 01:32:30,747
A lot better. So if I was to
say you only have to score five,

1675
01:32:30,898 --> 01:32:32,560
I would be really very generous, right?

1676
01:32:32,993 --> 01:32:35,753
No, no, that would be amazing if
we got five. Let's not get away-

1677
01:32:35,893 --> 01:32:37,117
Oh, come on, we can
get a five out of ten!

1678
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:39,480
Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!

1679
01:32:40,873 --> 01:32:41,763
We can't get five! Give
'em a five. Give 'em a five.

1680
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:42,782
We can do a five.

1681
01:32:42,922 --> 01:32:45,103
What are you talking about, Dad?
You haven't even seen us dance!

1682
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,018
That's the parlay.

1683
01:32:46,184 --> 01:32:47,516
Will somebody please explain
to me the parlay? Please?

1684
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:50,529
You gotta win two bets or you lose
the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to

1685
01:32:50,718 --> 01:32:54,643
win, the birds gotta beat the
Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta

1686
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:56,338
get at least a five at the dance.

1687
01:32:56,866 --> 01:33:00,958
That's very, very manic indeed.
That's the parlay. Shake on it.

1688
01:33:02,254 --> 01:33:06,073
You know what? I'm not gonna
be a part of this. Randy,

1689
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:08,698
Randy, you're a sickness. You're
a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.

1690
01:33:09,153 --> 01:33:11,598
Pat, you can't quit. I'm
not doing the dance. I'm out.

1691
01:33:11,929 --> 01:33:15,494
Pat, calm down. Thank
about it. See you later.

1692
01:33:15,643 --> 01:33:17,038
Pat, no. What are you doing?

1693
01:33:17,453 --> 01:33:18,498
Pat. I'm out.

1694
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:24,318
Here we are again at the one yard
line. DeSean, snatching defeat from

1695
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:26,129
the jaws of victory. There you go.

1696
01:33:26,314 --> 01:33:28,533
What does that even mean, Dad?
I'm not gonna make that, that, that

1697
01:33:28,678 --> 01:33:30,573
connection that you're making with
DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter

1698
01:33:30,728 --> 01:33:32,613
anymore okay? Just because I
have the fucking jersey on...

1699
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,123
I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.

1700
01:33:34,369 --> 01:33:37,539
You are not a stand up guy
right now. If it's me reading the

1701
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:39,481
signs... if it's me reading the signs-

1702
01:33:39,608 --> 01:33:41,234
If it's you reading the signs?
You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.

1703
01:33:43,536 --> 01:33:46,285
Pat! You are not a stand up guy!

1704
01:33:54,511 --> 01:33:56,058
Pat! I told you not to push it.

1705
01:33:56,883 --> 01:33:58,897
Yeah, but he's gotta do this
thing. He can't be a quitter.

1706
01:33:59,117 --> 01:33:59,993
He cannot be a quitter.

1707
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:04,813
You took that stupid parlay thing,
and now he won't do the dance and

1708
01:34:04,953 --> 01:34:07,464
it was very constructive
for him, and you ruined it.

1709
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:08,818
There's only one way to get him to show.

1710
01:34:09,738 --> 01:34:10,653
What's that? Oh, what's that?

1711
01:34:10,818 --> 01:34:13,022
We have to tell him
Nikki's gonna be there.

1712
01:34:32,405 --> 01:34:33,470
We have to tell him that she's going.

1713
01:34:33,648 --> 01:34:35,213
But that's a lie! It's a white lie.

1714
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:37,354
It's a white lie, what's that
matter? That's no big deal.

1715
01:34:37,848 --> 01:34:39,718
So it's a little lie.
There's no other way.

1716
01:34:40,179 --> 01:34:42,918
You know, we gotta leave a
trail of bread crumbs so that

1717
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:45,270
he can live his life without ruining it.

1718
01:34:46,224 --> 01:34:50,103
No. I don't approve. You can't do it.

1719
01:34:50,527 --> 01:34:53,223
Well, you know, I didn't approve
when you called her and you told

1720
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:56,698
her where he was running, so she
could ambush him. I didn't approve

1721
01:34:56,838 --> 01:35:00,618
of that, but you did it anyway, so
I'm doing this anyway. That's it.

1722
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:03,133
We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there.

1723
01:35:07,443 --> 01:35:11,243
You gotta be part of
it. We have to do it.

1724
01:35:13,323 --> 01:35:14,534
Aren't you nervous to be lying?

1725
01:35:15,848 --> 01:35:20,203
Yeah. A little bit.
But it's for the best.

1726
01:35:27,048 --> 01:35:28,528
"... but if it was me
reading the signs... "

1727
01:36:02,991 --> 01:36:03,472
That's it. Okay.

1728
01:36:29,054 --> 01:36:30,318
Hey.

1729
01:36:35,218 --> 01:36:36,500
Hey, what's up?

1730
01:36:40,897 --> 01:36:41,400
Sorry I'm late.

1731
01:36:41,447 --> 01:36:41,916
It's fine.

1732
01:38:08,588 --> 01:38:09,969
Come on, it's gonna be great.

1733
01:38:10,428 --> 01:38:14,558
Nikki's gonna be there. You know?
Everything's gonna come together.

1734
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:17,433
It's what's meant to be. You okay?

1735
01:38:19,973 --> 01:38:22,485
Don't get wobbly on me. I'm not.

1736
01:38:23,988 --> 01:38:26,598
We have a dance to do. We have
a parlay. You gotta stay focused.

1737
01:38:26,923 --> 01:38:28,821
I'm focused. Okay, let's go.

1738
01:38:47,068 --> 01:38:50,108
Look at the dancers. You see them? Shit.

1739
01:38:54,882 --> 01:38:57,169
Hey, Randy, Jake. What do we got?

1740
01:38:57,554 --> 01:38:59,398
Dallas just tied with another
field goal, three-three.

1741
01:38:59,563 --> 01:39:01,046
I'm worried about the bet.

1742
01:39:01,393 --> 01:39:03,002
Don't worry about the bet.
I'm worried about the bet.

1743
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:04,403
Holy shit.

1744
01:39:07,803 --> 01:39:09,803
Is this "Dancing with the Stars"?

1745
01:39:12,077 --> 01:39:14,033
Well, you knew that. Maybe
you should've scouted 'em.

1746
01:39:14,123 --> 01:39:16,053
Look at those fucking dancers!

1747
01:39:20,053 --> 01:39:21,953
You can give me the money now, you know?

1748
01:39:22,728 --> 01:39:24,773
Patty, Patty, all we have to
do is we have to make a five.

1749
01:39:24,978 --> 01:39:26,628
That's all. You stay here
and watch the game with me.

1750
01:39:27,032 --> 01:39:29,487
The birds are better when Pat
is with me. We settled that.

1751
01:39:29,818 --> 01:39:33,173
Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay?
I'll see you in a little bit.

1752
01:39:33,338 --> 01:39:34,287
I'll see you up there, okay? Okay.

1753
01:39:35,453 --> 01:39:36,488
Hey, Pat, Tiffany!

1754
01:39:37,445 --> 01:39:39,193
Hey. What a glorious,
beautiful occasion, man.

1755
01:39:39,443 --> 01:39:41,148
Yeah, yeah. All right,
buddy, I'll see you. Alright.

1756
01:39:41,298 --> 01:39:42,793
Wish me luck, man.

1757
01:39:43,248 --> 01:39:43,933
Excelsior!

1758
01:39:47,033 --> 01:39:47,933
Wait, what's this?

1759
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:49,013
What? I thought you were doing it.

1760
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,339
Oh, I thought you were doing it.
We're doing a dance thing anyway

1761
01:39:51,755 --> 01:39:52,254
for God's sake.

1762
01:40:01,025 --> 01:40:03,291
I want you to remember everything.
I want you to remember all of the

1763
01:40:03,434 --> 01:40:04,374
good stuff that we have here.

1764
01:40:04,529 --> 01:40:07,773
Of course I do. Just check
in. I gotta go find Veronica.

1765
01:40:09,308 --> 01:40:10,345
Hi, good evening. Evening.

1766
01:40:10,578 --> 01:40:13,749
Check in? How many dancers are there?

1767
01:40:18,023 --> 01:40:22,363
What?! Nikki? Nikki.

1768
01:40:24,363 --> 01:40:26,363
Oh, Jesus.

1769
01:40:43,098 --> 01:40:44,398
What the fuck?

1770
01:40:44,498 --> 01:40:46,918
Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.

1771
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,158
You're killing me. You're killing me!

1772
01:40:49,336 --> 01:40:51,498
Tiffany, please. She'll
see how well he's doing,

1773
01:40:51,633 --> 01:40:52,958
maybe she'll lift the restraining order.

1774
01:40:53,824 --> 01:40:55,628
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1775
01:40:56,143 --> 01:40:58,753
Pat told me. He told me you
should never throw a marriage

1776
01:40:58,903 --> 01:40:59,793
out the window.

1777
01:41:00,394 --> 01:41:02,628
Pat did not say that.
He didn't say that.

1778
01:41:03,023 --> 01:41:05,248
He said it several times,
Tiffany, and this is his chance.

1779
01:41:05,593 --> 01:41:06,558
You gotta give him a chance.

1780
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:42,518
Bartender! Bartender,
can I get a vodka, please?

1781
01:42:05,973 --> 01:42:09,899
So, you want another one? Sure.

1782
01:43:20,019 --> 01:43:24,598
So what do you do? I'm a
lawyer. Litigator, actually.

1783
01:43:29,093 --> 01:43:30,248
Oh, the arguing kind.

1784
01:43:30,348 --> 01:43:34,676
And the scores for Santos and Aguilar are: seven
point six, seven point three, seven point four, and

1785
01:43:35,373 --> 01:43:41,108
six point nine for an average
score of seven point three.

1786
01:43:41,917 --> 01:43:50,560
Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats Dallas!
They are on their way to the playoffs.

1787
01:44:00,034 --> 01:44:00,485
Where's Tiffany?

1788
01:44:00,753 --> 01:44:02,143
I don't know, Mom. Have you seen her?

1789
01:44:02,982 --> 01:44:04,514
You gotta find her. I know, Mom, I know.

1790
01:44:30,873 --> 01:44:33,450
Hey, WHAT are you doing? She's
fine, buddy, she's with me.

1791
01:44:33,828 --> 01:44:34,843
She's fine? Yeah.

1792
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:37,396
Why don't you shut up, okay?
How many drinks have you had?

1793
01:44:37,787 --> 01:44:40,083
I've had two vodkas. Listen,
I don't know what choices

1794
01:44:40,333 --> 01:44:42,588
you've made, but you gotta deal with
it right now, okay? We're in this.

1795
01:44:43,708 --> 01:44:44,421
We're in what?

1796
01:44:44,628 --> 01:44:48,743
Next, Pat Solatano and Tiffany Maxwell.

1797
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:50,690
You know, I used to think that
you were the best thing that ever

1798
01:44:50,813 --> 01:44:53,083
happened to me, but now I think
that you might maybe be the worst

1799
01:44:53,393 --> 01:44:55,883
thing and I'm sorry that I ever met you.

1800
01:44:56,338 --> 01:44:56,943
Good for you.

1801
01:44:57,093 --> 01:45:05,309
And the scores for Makarov and
Tretiak are: six point seven, eight

1802
01:45:05,469 --> 01:45:11,131
point one, seven point five and six
point five for an average score of

1803
01:45:11,624 --> 01:45:12,648
seven point two.

1804
01:45:18,853 --> 01:45:22,036
They were great and they
only got a seven point two.

1805
01:45:22,763 --> 01:45:23,298
This is a tough room.

1806
01:45:23,903 --> 01:45:24,228
Got it.

1807
01:45:27,333 --> 01:45:32,664
Up next, ladies and gentlemen please welcome
Pat Solatano, Jr. and Tiffany Maxwell.

1808
01:45:33,073 --> 01:45:39,418
Damn. Let's go, Patty! Come on, Pat!

1809
01:49:04,353 --> 01:49:06,973
Alright, let's see the scores
for Solatano and Maxwell.

1810
01:49:07,645 --> 01:49:13,948
We have a four point nine,
four eight, a four nine...

1811
01:49:15,695 --> 01:49:17,423
That's really too bad,
guys. That's a lot of fours.

1812
01:49:18,273 --> 01:49:24,368
...and and a five point four for an
average score of.. five point zero.

1813
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:29,506
Sorry about that, guys.

1814
01:49:34,939 --> 01:49:36,318
Dad, Dad, did the Eagles win?

1815
01:49:36,624 --> 01:49:39,199
The Eagles won, forty-four-six!
They won, forty- four-six!

1816
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:40,616
Come on!

1817
01:49:40,826 --> 01:49:45,178
Why are they so excited about a five?

1818
01:50:22,756 --> 01:50:26,669
How are you? You okay? Good. How are
you? I'm really good. Yeah, thanks.

1819
01:50:27,014 --> 01:50:29,033
You looked really
happy out there. Did I?

1820
01:50:29,868 --> 01:50:31,963
Yeah. Yeah, who'd have thought, dancing?

1821
01:50:37,068 --> 01:50:38,918
You look incredible. Thank you.

1822
01:50:39,745 --> 01:50:42,417
You lost a lot of weight. I've
been reading your books and,

1823
01:50:42,562 --> 01:50:45,669
I have a positive attitude. I'm
on medication, I'm in therapy.

1824
01:51:48,048 --> 01:51:50,098
Where's Tiffany? She left.
What do you mean, she left?

1825
01:51:50,748 --> 01:51:52,569
She left. What do you
think! Where is she?

1826
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:55,518
Let me tell you, I know you
don't wanna listen to your father,

1827
01:51:55,673 --> 01:51:58,153
I didn't listen to mine but
I'm telling you, you gotta pay

1828
01:51:58,303 --> 01:52:01,128
attention to the signs. When life
reaches out with a moment like

1829
01:52:01,268 --> 01:52:03,703
this, it's a sin if you don't reach
back. I'm telling you, it's a sin

1830
01:52:04,113 --> 01:52:06,863
if you don't reach back, and it'll
haunt you for the rest of your days

1831
01:52:07,028 --> 01:52:09,778
like a curse. You're facing a big
challenge in your life right now,

1832
01:52:10,093 --> 01:52:12,557
at this very moment, right here.
That girl loves you, she really

1833
01:52:12,687 --> 01:52:14,903
loves you. And I don't know if
Nikki ever did, but she sure as

1834
01:52:15,043 --> 01:52:17,713
hell doesn't love you right now.
I'm telling you, don't fuck this up.

1835
01:52:21,093 --> 01:52:22,138
I love you, Dad.

1836
01:52:37,472 --> 01:52:56,313
Hey! Would you just leave me alone?!

1837
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:59,003
Wait a second! I have one more
letter for you to read, okay?

1838
01:52:59,258 --> 01:53:01,453
What the fuck is the matter with
you? Give it to her yourself!

1839
01:53:01,798 --> 01:53:03,819
Let me say something. You don't
ever have to see me again if you

1840
01:53:03,963 --> 01:53:04,810
just read it, alright?

1841
01:53:05,967 --> 01:53:08,290
This is so fucked up.
Yeah, just read it.

1842
01:53:10,744 --> 01:53:12,058
"Dear Tiffany...

1843
01:53:16,383 --> 01:53:17,922
"... I know you wrote the letter.

1844
01:53:26,022 --> 01:53:28,022
The only way you could
meet my crazy... "

1845
01:53:28,078 --> 01:53:32,558
"... was by doing something
crazy yourself. Thank you.

1846
01:53:32,593 --> 01:53:33,558
I love you.

1847
01:53:37,233 --> 01:53:42,143
I knew it the minute I met you.
I'm sorry it took so long for me to

1848
01:53:42,273 --> 01:53:45,502
catch up. I just got stuck. Pat. "

1849
01:53:50,502 --> 01:53:52,502
I wrote that a week ago.

1850
01:53:54,088 --> 01:53:56,758
You wrote that a week ago? Yes, I did.

1851
01:53:56,818 --> 01:54:00,763
You let me lie to you for a
week? I was trying to be romantic.

1852
01:54:02,638 --> 01:54:05,874
You love me? Yeah, I do.

1853
01:54:13,428 --> 01:54:13,943
Okay.

1854
01:54:49,543 --> 01:54:52,645
The world will break your heart ten
ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.

1855
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:58,098
And I can't begin to explain that-
-or the craziness inside myself and

1856
01:54:58,278 --> 01:55:02,113
everybody else, but guess what?
Sunday is my favorite day again.

1857
01:55:03,585 --> 01:55:08,618
I think of everything everyone did for
me and I feel like... a very lucky guy.

1858
01:55:12,088 --> 01:55:14,316
We have to beat the Vikings by
three. I'm givin' you a six, which

1859
01:55:14,471 --> 01:55:18,138
is very generous after the beating
you just took. So what are we

1860
01:55:18,288 --> 01:55:19,463
doin', what are we talkin' about here?

1861
01:55:19,873 --> 01:55:22,559
I'd like to do another parlay if we
make it to the next round, that's all.

1862
01:55:22,898 --> 01:55:25,003
But we are gonna make it to the
next round. We're gonna beat...

1863
01:55:25,149 --> 01:55:27,658
No, that was me that
did that. No that was me.

1864
01:55:28,133 --> 01:55:32,345
That was me. I played the Jack.
So you put the bread crumbs, the

1865
01:55:32,495 --> 01:55:34,733
garlic in the steak and you
roll it up with the toothpicks?

1866
01:55:34,973 --> 01:55:38,018
Yeah. For, oh, maybe three hours, plus.

1867
01:55:38,412 --> 01:55:41,053
Everything's good, everything's
good, yeah. I got you, you're all

1868
01:55:41,213 --> 01:55:44,672
down. No, Randy, he's
complaining. You know he lost a lot

1869
01:55:44,807 --> 01:55:46,819
of money. He's moaning and
groaning. The restaurant's

1870
01:55:46,953 --> 01:55:50,203
happening because of
Randy, so everything's good.

1871
