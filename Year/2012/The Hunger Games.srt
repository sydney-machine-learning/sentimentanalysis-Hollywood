1
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:02,646
I think it's our tradition.

2
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,107
It comes out of a particularly painful
part of our history.

3
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:07,275
Yes, yes.

4
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,362
But it's been the way
we've been able to heal.

5
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,614
At first, it was a reminder of the rebellion.

6
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:15,533
- It was a price the districts had to pay.
- Yes.

7
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,869
But I think it has grown from that.

8
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:21,373
I think it's something
that knits us all together.

9
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,460
This is your third year as Gamemaker.

10
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:30,590
What defines your personal signature?

11
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,719
No! No!

12
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,950
It's okay.

13
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:41,226
You were just dreaming.
You were dreaming.

14
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,646
It was me.

15
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,858
I know. I know. But it's not.

16
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,153
It's your first year, Prim.
Your name's only been in there once.

17
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,322
They're not gonna pick you.

18
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,574
Try to go to sleep.

19
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,867
I can't.

20
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,371
Just try. Just try.

21
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:16,177
Deep in the meadow

22
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:20,598
Under the willow

23
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,770
- A bed of grass
- A bed of grass

24
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:29,858
- A soft green pillow
- A soft green pillow

25
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,778
You remember that song? Okay.

26
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,156
You finish it. I've got to go.

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,282
Where?

28
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,326
I've just got to go.

29
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,454
But I'll be back. I love you.

30
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:52,839
I'll still cook you.

31
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,013
What are you gonna do with that
when you kill it?

32
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,518
Damn you, Gale! It's not funny!

33
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:13,646
What are you gonna do
with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?

34
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:16,274
It's Reaping Day.
The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.

35
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,486
I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.

36
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,778
Of course you were.

37
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,113
Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers.

38
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:23,531
No. Not today.

39
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,618
It was the first deer I've seen in a year.
Now I have nothing.

40
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,827
Okay.

41
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,172
What if they did? Just one year.
What if everyone just stopped watching?

42
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,383
- They won't, Gale.
- What if they did? What if we did?

43
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,009
Won't happen.

44
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,178
You root for your favorites.
You cry when they get killed.

45
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:28,513
- It's sick.
- Gale.

46
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,974
If no one watches,
then they don't have a game.

47
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,517
It's as simple as that.

48
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,185
- What?
- Nothing.

49
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,314
- Fine. Laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

50
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,197
We could do it, you know?

51
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,410
Take off, live in the woods.
It's what we do anyway.

52
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,536
They'd catch us.

53
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,246
Well, maybe not.

54
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,375
Cut out our tongues, or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.

55
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,295
No, I'd get five miles. I'd go that way.

56
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,047
I have Prim, and you have your brothers.

57
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,132
They can come, too.

58
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,925
Prim in the woods?

59
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,262
Or maybe not.

60
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,473
I'm never having kids.

61
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,727
I might, if I didn't live here.

62
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,979
- But you do live here.
- I know, but if I didn't.

63
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,900
I forgot.

64
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,569
Here.

65
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,238
Oh, my God! Is this real?

66
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,824
Yeah. Better be. Cost me a squirrel.

67
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,744
Happy Hunger Games.

68
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,788
"And may the odds be ever in your favor."

69
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,754
How many times is your name in today?

70
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,172
Forty-two.

71
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:49,344
Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor.

72
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,746
Thank you, girl.

73
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,130
What's this?

74
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,716
That's a Mockingjay.

75
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,261
How much?

76
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,308
- You keep it. It's yours.
- Thank you.

77
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,114
Mom.

78
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,867
Look at you!

79
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,994
You look beautiful.

80
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,705
But you better tuck in that tail,
little duck.

81
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,416
I laid something out for you, too.

82
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,420
Okay.

83
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,904
Now you look beautiful, too.

84
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,698
Wish I looked like you.

85
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,952
No. I wish I looked like you, little duck.

86
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,544
Hey. You want to see what I got you today?

87
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,550
It's a Mockingjay pin. To protect you.

88
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,014
And as long as you have it,
nothing bad will happen to you.

89
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,266
Okay? I promise.

90
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,951
Prim, it's okay. It's okay.

91
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,786
Okay. It's time to sign in now. Okay?

92
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,996
They're gonna prick your finger
just to take a little bit of blood.

93
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,206
- You didn't say...
- I know.

94
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,874
It doesn't hurt much. Just a little.

95
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,410
Okay? Go sit down there
with the little kids.

96
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:10,878
I'll find you after. Okay?

97
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,548
Next.

98
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,895
Go ahead. Next.

99
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:46,163
Next.

100
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,276
It's okay.

101
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,744
Welcome! Welcome, welcome.

102
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,496
Happy Hunger Games.

103
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,917
And may the odds be ever in your favor.

104
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,798
Now, before we begin,
we have a very special film.

105
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,552
Brought to you all the way from The Capitol.

106
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,391
War. Terrible war.

107
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:49,977
War.

108
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:55,733
Terrible war.
Widows, orphans, a motherless child.

109
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,445
This was the uprising that rocked our land.

110
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,491
Thirteen districts rebelled against
the country that fed them,

111
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,409
loved them, protected them.

112
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,372
Brother turned on brother
until nothing remained.

113
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:14,335
And then came the peace,
hard fought, sorely won.

114
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,714
A people rose up from the ashes,
and a new era was born.

115
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,678
But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.

116
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:28,349
We swore as a nation
we would never know this treason again.

117
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:33,646
And so it was decreed that each year
the various districts of Panem

118
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,358
would offer up, in tribute,
one young man and woman

119
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:42,613
to fight to the death in a pageant of honor,
courage, and sacrifice.

120
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,992
The lone victor, bathed in riches,
would serve as a reminder

121
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,121
of our generosity and our forgiveness.

122
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,873
This is how we remember our past.

123
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,002
This is how we safeguard our future.

124
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,671
I just love that!

125
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,136
Now, the time has come for us to select

126
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,098
one courageous young man and woman

127
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:17,064
for the honor of representing District 12
in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

128
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,902
As usual, ladies first.

129
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,597
Primrose Everdeen.

130
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,606
Where are you, dear?

131
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,524
Come on up.

132
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,319
Well, come on up.

133
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,468
Prim! Prim!

134
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,470
No. No!

135
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,722
I volunteer! I volunteer!

136
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,475
I volunteer as Tribute!

137
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,731
I believe we have a volunteer, Mr. Mayor.

138
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,775
Prim, you need to get out of here.
You need to get out of here.

139
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,193
- No! No!
- Go find Mom!

140
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,903
- Prim, go find Mom right now. I'm so sorry.
- No!

141
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,448
- Go find Mom. Prim, leave! Go find Mom.
- No! No! No!

142
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:53,118
- No! No! No!
- Come on.

143
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,413
A dramatic turn of events here in District 12.

144
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,291
Yes, well.

145
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:03,254
District 12's very first volunteer.
Bring her up.

146
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,843
Come on, dear.

147
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,104
What's your name?

148
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,856
Katniss Everdeen.

149
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,860
Well, I bet my hat that was your sister,
wasn't it?

150
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,362
Yes.

151
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:34,827
Let's have a big hand for
our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.

152
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,885
And now for the boys.

153
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,229
Peeta Mellark.

154
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,504
Here we are.

155
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,425
Our Tributes from District 12.

156
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,386
Well, go on, you two, shake hands.

157
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,568
Happy Hunger Games.

158
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,864
And may the odds be ever in your favor.

159
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,879
You have three minutes.

160
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,592
It's okay.

161
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:18,263
Prim. Prim. It's okay.
Prim, I don't have much time.

162
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:22,893
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.

163
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:25,187
It isn't worth putting your name in
more times. Okay?

164
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,233
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.

165
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,902
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

166
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,988
Of course.

167
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,991
And maybe I can. I am smart, you know?

168
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,827
- And you can hunt.
- Exactly.

169
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,835
To protect you.

170
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,675
Thank you.

171
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,898
You can't tune out again.

172
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,861
- I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.

173
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,612
I won't be there anymore.
You're all she has.

174
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,741
No matter what you feel, you have to
be there for her. Do you understand?

175
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,785
Don't cry.

176
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,458
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.

177
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,670
- It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.

178
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,632
- Prim, it's okay. It's okay, Prim.
- No! No! No!

179
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,676
I promise, Prim.

180
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,612
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.

181
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,905
I am.

182
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,826
Listen to me. You're stronger than they are.
You are.

183
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,161
- Get to a bow.
- They may not have...

184
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,497
They will if you show them
how good you are.

185
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,707
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

186
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,626
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one, okay?

187
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,211
You know how to hunt.

188
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,545
Animals.

189
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,340
It's no different, Katniss.

190
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,512
There's 24 of us, Gale. Only one comes out.

191
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,764
Yeah. And it's gonna be you.

192
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,390
Okay.

193
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,643
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.

194
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,770
- Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?

195
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,691
You two are in for a treat.

196
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,445
Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs,
and it flies.

197
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,697
We'll be at The Capitol
in less than two days.

198
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,283
Now, before you do anything else...

199
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,259
200 miles per hour,
and you can barely feel a thing.

200
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,095
I think it's one of the wonderful things about
this opportunity,

201
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,724
that even though you're here
and even though it's just for a little while,

202
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,351
you get to enjoy all of this.

203
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:59,443
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.

204
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,373
Have you ever met him?

205
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,419
Haymitch?

206
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:25,886
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.

207
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,145
Look, you know,
if you don't want to talk, I understand,

208
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,440
but I just don't think there's anything wrong
with getting a little bit of help.

209
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,925
Congratulations.

210
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,487
Where's the ice?

211
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,448
I don't know.

212
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,956
May I?

213
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:44,548
Okay, so... So when do we start?

214
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,342
So eager.

215
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,637
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.

216
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,223
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.

217
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,641
- You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?

218
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,019
Yeah, our mentor.

219
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,771
You're supposed to tell us
how to get sponsors and give us advice.

220
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,732
Okay.

221
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,154
Embrace the probability
of your imminent death.

222
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:14,369
And know, in your heart,
that there's nothing I can do to save you.

223
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,372
So why are you here then?

224
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,624
The refreshments.

225
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,168
Okay, I think that's enough of that.

226
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,593
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.

227
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,681
You know, I think I'll go
finish this in my room.

228
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,574
He's gonna come around.

229
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,784
It's no use.

230
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,786
I'm gonna go talk to him.

231
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,837
We have two very fit 16-year-olds.

232
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:09,257
Of course, of course.
They always provide pretty good opponents.

233
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,675
Yes, yes, they do.

234
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,636
- Do you remember this year?
- Of course.

235
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,306
One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.

236
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:19,309
The use of the rubble in the ruined city...

237
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,644
Very exciting.

238
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,312
And this moment here,

239
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,981
this moment is a moment
that you never forget.

240
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,400
Yes.

241
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,569
The moment when a Tribute
becomes a victor.

242
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,649
- You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.

243
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,359
That's a good way to get killed.

244
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,027
What's a good way to get killed?

245
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,073
Joy. Why don't you join us?

246
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,910
I was just giving some life-saving advice.

247
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,496
Like what?

248
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,874
I was just asking about how to find shelter.

249
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:28,044
Which would come in handy if,
in fact, you were still alive.

250
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,798
How do you find shelter?

251
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,009
Pass the jam.

252
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,677
How do you find shelter?

253
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,555
Give me a chance to wake up, sweetheart.

254
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,894
This mentoring is very taxing stuff.

255
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,401
Can you pass the marmalade?

256
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,738
That is mahogany!

257
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,992
Look at you. Just killed a placemat.

258
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,746
You really want to know how to stay alive?

259
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,999
You get people to like you.

260
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,171
Not what you were expecting?

261
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:17,469
Well, when you're in the middle of
The Games and you're starving or freezing,

262
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,972
some water, a knife, or even some matches

263
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,558
can mean the difference
between life and death.

264
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:27,062
And those things only come from sponsors.

265
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:31,733
And to get sponsors,
you have to make people like you.

266
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:38,240
And right now, sweetheart,
you're not off to a real good start.

267
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,575
There it is.

268
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,207
It's huge!

269
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,834
That's incredible.

270
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,027
Peeta, I love you.

271
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,830
Come on. Come on.

272
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:35,297
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.

273
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,851
So now that you've seen them,

274
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,729
what do you think about
this year's crop of recruits?

275
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,024
Are there any surprises
that we can expect this year?

276
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,650
It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping,

277
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:59,154
- but I think this is a very interesting mix.
- Yes.

278
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,448
And whenever you have a volunteer
from an outlying district,

279
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,867
that's something you can't ignore.

280
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:34,981
What's that?

281
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,233
We're just saying we might need
to hose you down again

282
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,444
before we take you to Cinna.

283
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:50,205
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?

284
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,499
- My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.

285
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,043
I'm sorry that this happened to you,

286
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,087
and I'm here to help you
in any way that I can.

287
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,633
Most people just congratulate me.

288
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,010
Well, I don't see the point in that.

289
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:08,056
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.

290
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,102
I'm gonna take you out
and show you off to the world.

291
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,937
So you're here to make me look pretty?

292
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,355
I'm here to help you make an impression.

293
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,275
Now, usually they dress people
in the clothes from their district.

294
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,736
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.

295
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,240
I wanna do something
that they're gonna remember.

296
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,867
Did they explain
about trying to get sponsors?

297
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,662
Yeah, but I'm not very good
at making friends.

298
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,330
We'll see.

299
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,126
I just think somebody that brave

300
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,381
shouldn't be dressed up
in some stupid costume, now should they?

301
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,218
I hope not.

302
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,477
Okay, this is safe. I promise.

303
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:57,814
It's not real fire. These suits are built
so you won't feel a thing.

304
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,149
Looks pretty real to me.

305
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,817
Well, that's the idea.

306
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:01,901
You ready?

307
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,446
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

308
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:30,263
Over 100,000 people craning
to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.

309
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,349
And the sponsors get to see the Tributes
for the first time.

310
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,352
The importance of this moment
cannot be overstated.

311
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,650
Very nice.

312
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,947
First chariot on my count, in 15, 14, 13...

313
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,953
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.

314
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,039
It's the most exciting part.

315
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,041
It just gives you goose bumps.

316
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,251
And don't you love how the stylists,

317
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:04,631
they so clearly are able to
reflect the character of each district?

318
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,717
- Right. Right. There's District 4.
- Yes.

319
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:09,719
- Fishing.
- I get it.

320
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,971
- I like it.
- That's very good.

321
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:17,101
And behind them,
we have two power plant workers. Right?

322
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,561
And then...

323
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,898
What is that in the background?

324
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,842
Come on. They'll love it.

325
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:57,934
Yeah!

326
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,477
Now see that? I love that.

327
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,272
Two young people
holding their hands up, saying,

328
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:06,150
"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."

329
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,402
- Nope.
- I love that!

330
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,196
People are sure gonna be paying attention
to them right now.

331
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,325
And we're ready.

332
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,910
President Snow, you're live.

333
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:52,822
Welcome.

334
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,285
Tributes, we welcome you.

335
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:04,334
We salute your courage and your sacrifice.

336
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,089
And we wish you

337
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,093
Happy Hunger Games.

338
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,431
And may the odds be ever in your favor.

339
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,029
That was amazing.

340
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,615
We are all
anybody's going to be talking about.

341
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,367
So brave.

342
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,577
Are you sure you should be
near an open flame?

343
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,997
Fake flame? Are you sure you...

344
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,550
Let's go upstairs.

345
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,431
So, each of the districts get their own floor.

346
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,976
And because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

347
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,485
Come on.

348
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,616
So this is the living room.

349
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,494
I know, I know.

350
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,997
Now, your rooms are right over here.

351
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:28,835
Why don't you go clean yourselves up
a little before dinner?

352
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:50,208
In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead.

353
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,251
One of you will be alive.

354
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:56,714
Who that is depends on how well
you pay attention over the next four days,

355
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,383
particularly to what I'm about to say.

356
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,553
First, no fighting with the other Tributes.

357
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,514
You'll have plenty of time for that
in the Arena.

358
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:09,477
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.

359
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,563
My advice is don't ignore the survival skills.

360
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,232
Everybody wants to grab a sword,

361
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,026
but most of you will die
from natural causes.

362
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,988
10% from infection, 20% from dehydration.

363
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,950
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.

364
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,484
- Jason, where's my knife, huh?
- I didn't touch your knife.

365
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:01,153
- I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!

366
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,780
- Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!

367
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,448
- You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.

368
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:05,533
- You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!

369
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,743
You little punk! He took my knife!

370
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,579
- Get off me!
- I'm just sitting here.

371
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,248
I'll finish you right now, kid!

372
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,041
Actually, better yet,
I'll wait for the Arena.

373
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,626
You're the first one I get,
so watch your back.

374
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,300
- Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!

375
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,760
He's a Career. You know what that is?

376
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,846
- From District 1.
- And 2.

377
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,766
They train in a special academy
until they're 18. Then they volunteer.

378
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:34,061
By that point, they're pretty lethal.

379
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,230
But they don't receive any special treatment.

380
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,816
In fact, they stay in the exact
same apartment as you do.

381
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:41,903
And I don't think they let them have dessert.
And you can.

382
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,697
So how good are they?

383
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,285
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...

384
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,620
Almost.

385
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,872
...they can be arrogant.

386
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:56,959
And arrogance can be a big problem.

387
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,297
I hear you can shoot.

388
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,301
I'm all right.

389
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,929
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.

390
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,058
He says she hits them
right in the eye every time.

391
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,645
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

392
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,147
He can throw a 100-pound sack
of flour right over his head. I've seen it.

393
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,608
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill
anybody with a sack of flour.

394
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,318
No, but you might have
a better chance of winning

395
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,653
if somebody comes after you with a knife.

396
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,781
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?

397
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,081
It's true. Everybody knows it.

398
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,419
You know what my mother said?

399
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:43,839
She said District 12
might finally have a winner.

400
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,008
But she wasn't talking about me.

401
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,470
She was talking about you.

402
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,686
I'm not very hungry.

403
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:35,850
I'm done, too.

404
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,519
Throw that metal thing over there.

405
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:21,979
What?

406
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,193
No. Haymitch said we're not supposed
to show our skills.

407
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,277
I don't care what Haymitch said.

408
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,404
Those guys are looking at you
like you're a meal.

409
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:31,572
Throw it.

410
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,660
Hi.

411
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,620
Hey.

412
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,455
How did you do that?

413
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:25,251
I used to decorate the cakes
down at the bakery.

414
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:27,920
I'll show you.

415
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,257
See?

416
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,051
Yeah.

417
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,930
Hey, I think you have a shadow.

418
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,960
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one
and evaluate you.

419
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:11,922
This is important, because higher ratings
will mean sponsors.

420
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:14,717
This is the time to show them everything.

421
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,636
There'll be a bow. Make sure you use it.

422
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:19,471
Peeta, you make sure to show your strength.

423
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:24,018
They'll start with District 1,
so the two of you will go last.

424
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,564
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.

425
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,286
Katniss Everdeen.

426
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,424
Hey, Katniss?

427
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,801
Shoot straight.

428
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,780
Katniss Everdeen.

429
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,908
District 12.

430
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:30,913
Hey, hey, hey.

431
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:34,500
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!

432
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:35,876
Did you get some pig yet?

433
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,522
Thank you for your consideration.

434
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:04,446
- Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.

435
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:05,656
Mad?

436
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:11,453
You realize that your actions reflect badly
on all of us. Not just you.

437
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,080
They just want a good show. It's fine.

438
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,750
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?

439
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:21,255
Well, finally! I hope you noticed
we have a serious situation.

440
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,136
Nice shooting, sweetheart.

441
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:32,641
What did they do when you shot the apple?

442
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,060
Well, they looked pretty startled.

443
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,437
Yeah.

444
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,983
Now, what did you say? "Thanks for..."

445
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,651
- Thanks for your consideration.
- "... your consideration."

446
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,070
Genius! Genius.

447
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:49,825
I don't think we're gonna find this funny
if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...

448
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,368
On who? On her?

449
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,662
On him?

450
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,748
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.

451
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,419
I would have given anything to see it.

452
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:04,173
As you know, the Tributes were rated
on a scale of 1 to 12

453
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,092
after three days of careful evaluation.

454
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:10,888
The Gamekeepers would like
to acknowledge that it was an exceptional...

455
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:16,310
From District 1, Marvel,
with a score of nine.

456
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,938
From District 2, Cato, with a score of 10.

457
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,232
Clove, with a score of 10.

458
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,527
From District 3...
From District 4, with a score of...

459
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:26,987
From District 7...

460
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,739
From District 8...

461
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:32,117
And Rue with a score of seven.

462
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:33,911
Now our final district.

463
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:38,665
From District 12. Peeta Mellark.

464
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:45,172
A score of eight.

465
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:47,758
- Excellent.
- Peeta!

466
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:48,884
Bravo.

467
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,178
- We can work with that.
- Good job.

468
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:54,973
And finally,

469
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:58,852
from District 12,

470
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,232
Katniss Everdeen.

471
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,487
With a score of...

472
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:12,658
Eleven.

473
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:16,495
- Katniss!
- Outstanding!

474
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,038
- Yes!
- Eleven?

475
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,207
Congratulations.

476
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,625
I thought they hated me.

477
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,043
They must have liked your guts.

478
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:27,256
To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

479
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,175
Goodness. We are.

480
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,510
An 11 ?

481
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:32,970
She earned it.

482
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,097
She shot an arrow at your head.

483
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,473
Well, at an apple.

484
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:37,808
Near your head.

485
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,851
Sit down.

486
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,193
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?

487
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,030
What do you mean?

488
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:56,702
I mean, why do we have a winner?

489
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:01,206
I mean, if we just wanted to
intimidate the districts,

490
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:05,877
why not round up 24 of them at random
and execute them all at once?

491
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,713
Be a lot faster.

492
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,133
Hope.

493
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,176
Hope?

494
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,344
Hope.

495
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,307
It is the only thing stronger than fear.

496
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:23,604
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.

497
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,982
A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.

498
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,444
So...

499
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:34,656
So contain it.

500
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,243
Right.

501
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:41,580
So she's staring at all my jewels.
She cannot take her eyes off of them.

502
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,082
- Well, look at all that that you're wearing.
- Frankly, it was rude.

503
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,793
Haymitch, you should join us.

504
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,338
We're having some of
your favorite for dinner.

505
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,589
Lovely.

506
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,553
- Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.

507
00:50:56,637 --> 00:51:00,515
Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.

508
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,226
And they let us work with our own Tributes
right before The Games,

509
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,104
so you and I will be going down at 9:00.

510
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,107
What about him?

511
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:13,278
He says he wants to be trained
on his own from now on.

512
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,614
What?

513
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,161
This kind of thing does happen at this point.
There's only one winner, right?

514
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:29,711
We should have some
chocolate-covered strawberries.

515
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:31,630
- Oh, my, yes.
- Please.

516
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,178
Ladies and gentlemen,
your master of ceremonies,

517
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,972
Caesar Flickerman!

518
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,521
Thank you! Thank you!

519
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:54,945
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to the 74th Annual Hunger Games!

520
00:51:56,155 --> 00:52:00,283
Now, in about five minutes,
they're all going to be out here.

521
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,953
All of the Tributes that you've heard about.

522
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,413
Are you excited?

523
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,873
Let me hear it!

524
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:11,461
Amazing.

525
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,673
I don't feel amazing.

526
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,675
Don't you know how beautiful you look?

527
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,593
No. And I don't know
how to make people like me.

528
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,263
- How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.

529
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,639
That's different. I wasn't trying.

530
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,726
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.

531
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,355
And just pretend
that you're talking to me. Okay?

532
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,690
Okay.

533
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,775
Let's see if she does indeed shine.

534
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,279
Let's have a warm round of applause
for Glimmer!

535
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,493
Glimmer, are you prepared?

536
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,829
Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared.

537
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,665
I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.

538
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:49,958
- Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...

539
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,835
...I'm wearing one of our own creations.

540
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,713
A big round of applause!

541
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,550
Marvel!

542
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,180
Welcome, Clove.

543
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,140
- It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.

544
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,642
I'm prepared. I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.

545
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,061
Cato!

546
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,648
I find that if I can apply myself
to the situation present,

547
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,025
I will be able to figure it out.

548
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,570
Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.

549
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,492
Good. So you can climb trees.

550
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,952
You're pretty quick. And are you a hunter?

551
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:27,621
A gatherer?

552
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:37,506
From District 12, District 12...

553
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,759
You know her as The Girl on Fire!

554
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,681
Well, we know her
as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!

555
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:04,950
Welcome! Welcome.

556
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:08,787
Welcome.

557
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,124
Well, that was quite an entrance
you made the other day.

558
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:17,295
What?

559
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,091
I think someone's a little nervous.

560
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,762
I said that was quite an entrance
that you made

561
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,597
at the Tribute Parade the other day.

562
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,849
Do you want to tell us about it?

563
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,229
Well, I was just hoping that
I wouldn't burn to death.

564
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,239
When you came out of that chariot,

565
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:47,826
I have to say, my heart stopped.

566
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,829
Did any of you experience this as well?

567
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,330
My heart stopped.

568
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:56,710
So did mine.

569
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,798
Now, tell me about the flames.
Are they real?

570
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,008
Yes.

571
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:11,474
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?

572
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,312
Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?

573
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,688
Yes.

574
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,356
What do you think, folks?

575
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:21,318
I think that's a yes.

576
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,555
Steady. Steady.

577
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,058
Lovely. Thank you.

578
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,688
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.

579
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:01,149
That was something. Thank you for that.

580
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,779
I have one more question for you.

581
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,782
It's about your sister.

582
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:17,582
We were all very moved, I think, when
you volunteered for her at the Reaping.

583
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:22,295
Did she come and say goodbye to you?

584
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,421
Yes.

585
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,548
- She did.
- She did.

586
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:31,429
And what did you say to her in the end?

587
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,935
I told her that I would try to win.

588
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:40,772
That I would try to win for her.

589
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,274
Of course you did.

590
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:46,736
And try you will.

591
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,532
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,

592
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,119
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

593
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,544
You did it, darling. That was incredible.

594
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,045
Thank you.

595
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,589
Nice job, sweetheart.

596
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,633
Thank you.

597
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:10,301
Nice dress, too.

598
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,014
- Not yours.
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!

599
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:23,189
Peeta, welcome.

600
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,402
How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map."

601
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,113
It's different.
It's very different than back home.

602
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,074
Different. In what way? Give us an example.

603
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:35,493
Okay. Well, the showers here are weird.

604
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,995
- The showers?
- Yes.

605
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,663
We have different showers.

606
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:42,751
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?

607
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,671
- Take a whiff?
- All right.

608
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,216
- You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?

609
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,559
- You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.

610
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,810
That makes sense.

611
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:07,942
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me,

612
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,613
is there a special girl back home?

613
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,323
No. No. Not really.

614
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:17,619
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.

615
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:21,664
Handsome man like you. Peeta, tell me.

616
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,543
Well, there...

617
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,380
There is this one girl
that I've had a crush on forever.

618
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:34,594
But I don't think she actually recognized me
until the Reaping.

619
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,224
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.

620
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:44,187
You go out there and you win this thing,

621
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:47,899
and when you get home,
she'll have to go out with you.

622
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,609
Right, folks?

623
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:56,491
Thanks, but I don't think winning's
gonna help me at all.

624
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:57,951
And why not?

625
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,748
Because she came here with me.

626
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,587
Well, that's bad luck.

627
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:11,548
Yeah, it is.

628
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,594
- And I wish you all the best of luck.
- Thank you.

629
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:19,055
Peeta Mellark.

630
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,724
District 12!

631
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:26,771
What the hell was that?

632
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,857
You don't talk to me,
and then you say you have a crush on me?

633
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,025
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?

634
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,735
Stop it! Stop it!

635
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,987
- Let's start right now!
- Hey!

636
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,116
- He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.

637
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,036
He made you look desirable,
which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.

638
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:43,162
He's right, Katniss.

639
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:44,455
Of course I'm right.

640
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:47,959
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers
from District 12...

641
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,544
We are not star-crossed lovers.

642
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,379
It's a television show!

643
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:55,216
And being in love with that boy
might just get you sponsors,

644
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,635
which could save your damn life.

645
00:59:58,888 --> 01:00:01,598
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?

646
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:05,310
Maybe I can deliver you both
in one piece tomorrow.

647
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,811
Manners!

648
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,177
You, too?

649
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,347
Hey.

650
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:43,932
Can't sleep?

651
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:45,725
No. Of course not.

652
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,396
I'm sorry I went after you.

653
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:55,360
You know, I meant that as a compliment.

654
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,070
I know.

655
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:09,958
Listen to them.

656
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,002
Yeah.

657
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,884
I just don't want them to change me.

658
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:24,514
How would they change you?

659
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,187
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.

660
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:36,442
I just don't want to be
another piece in their game, you know?

661
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:39,988
You mean you won't kill anyone?

662
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,324
No.

663
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,828
I mean, I'm sure I would,
just like anybody else

664
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:47,996
when the time came,

665
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:53,418
but I just keep wishing
that I could think of a way to show them

666
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:55,253
that they don't own me.

667
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,969
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.

668
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:10,518
Does that make any sense?

669
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,728
Yeah.

670
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,190
I just can't afford to think like that.

671
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,405
I have my sister.

672
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,950
Yeah, I know.

673
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,925
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

674
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,388
See you tomorrow.

675
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:17,502
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front,
right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.

676
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:20,338
There'll even be a bow there.
Don't go for it.

677
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:21,672
Why not?

678
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,966
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.

679
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,468
That's not your game.

680
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,514
You turn, run, find high ground,
look for water.

681
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:31,808
Water's your new best friend.

682
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:36,604
Don't step off that pedestal early
or they'll blow you sky high.

683
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,939
I won't.

684
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:53,079
Katniss, you can do this.

685
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:02,421
Thanks.

686
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:14,433
Give me your arm.

687
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:22,733
- Give me your arm.
- What is that?

688
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:26,988
Your tracker.

689
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,532
We're up.

690
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,117
We're up!

691
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:37,498
All right. Less than a minute, people.
Final checks.

692
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,917
There are 15 out. They are flying.

693
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,789
Here.

694
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,436
Thank you.

695
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,529
Thirty seconds.

696
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:01,999
I'm not allowed to bet,
but if I could, I'd bet on you.

697
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:15,304
Twenty seconds.

698
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:29,443
Ten seconds.

699
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:57,596
Okay, they're in the tubes.

700
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:41,932
50, 49, 48, 47,

701
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:46,353
46, 45, 44, 43,

702
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:49,857
42, 41, 40,

703
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:53,861
39, 38, 37, 36,

704
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:58,157
35, 34, 33, 32,

705
01:07:58,617 --> 01:08:02,578
31, 30, 29, 28,

706
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:06,040
27, 26, 25,

707
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:09,168
24, 23, 22...

708
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:23,529
And, of course,
there's the familiar "boom" of the cannon,

709
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,657
which marks the end
of another fallen Tribute.

710
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,450
...eight...

711
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:30,536
...nine...

712
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:32,997
...10...

713
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,207
...11...

714
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,043
...12.

715
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:21,605
Twenty-five? Got it.

716
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:27,361
He's moving now.

717
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,207
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

718
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:06,668
And Claudius,
I think I see an alliance forming.

719
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:13,842
Wait! Did you see the look on her face?

720
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:15,802
- How stupid can you get?
- A fire?

721
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:19,348
"Oh, no! Please don't kill me! Oh, no!"

722
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,767
That's actually a good impression.

723
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,268
Hey, lover boy!

724
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:27,189
- You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

725
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:29,483
You better be.

726
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,528
Yeah, that was her snare
we found back there.

727
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:40,494
Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now?

728
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,412
Nah. He's our best chance of finding her.

729
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:44,873
Let's go.

730
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:06,144
Sir?

731
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,440
She is almost at the edge.

732
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:13,110
Two kilometers away
from the nearest Tribute.

733
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,528
Let's turn her around.

734
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:18,258
Cueing another. On my count. One, two...

735
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,272
She's heading towards the left flank.

736
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:34,691
Okay. Can you give me a tree right there?

737
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:37,402
Sure. Cueing tree.

738
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,789
She's almost there.

739
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,638
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

740
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,193
There she is! There she is!

741
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,449
- She's mine!
- Not if I get her first!

742
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:12,122
- Where you gonna go?
- Mine!

743
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,750
Fish out of the pond!
And someone found her.

744
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:23,133
- There she is!
- Yeah!

745
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:29,598
Here we go!

746
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,814
- Where you going, huh?
- Get her, Cato!

747
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:39,483
Where do you think you're going?

748
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,404
Where you going, baby?

749
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:46,907
Three o'clock.

750
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,536
- Where you going, Girl on Fire?
- We got her!

751
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,163
Miss Everdeen, I'm gonna get you!

752
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,581
That's not gonna help you up there, Katniss.

753
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,374
Where are you going?

754
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:59,211
- Go get her, man!
- You are so done.

755
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,296
Just get her, Cato!

756
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,380
- He's gonna get you, Katniss.
- Look at her scurry.

757
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,382
Right up there.

758
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,968
- Kill her!
- Just go, keep going!

759
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,846
- Go, Cato.
- Come on, Cato.

760
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:10,931
- She's right there.
- Go, Cato! Come on, Cato!

761
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,057
You got this.

762
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,099
Go! He's got this.

763
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:15,685
- Kill her, Cato! Just get her, Cato!
- Go! Go!

764
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,312
- Take her down!
- Go! Go!

765
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,272
- You got this, Cato!
- Come on, kill her!

766
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:20,774
I'm coming for you!

767
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,317
Come on, Cato!

768
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,156
I'll do it myself.

769
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,790
Give me that before...

770
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,917
- Get her.
- Come on. Come on, come on!

771
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:44,047
Maybe you should throw the sword!

772
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,424
Let's just wait her out.

773
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:52,597
She's gotta come down at some point.
It's that or starve to death.

774
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:53,890
We'll just kill her then.

775
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,229
Okay.

776
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:01,731
Somebody make a fire.

777
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,246
- Let's make camp over here!
- Hurry up with the fire.

778
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,639
Boys.

779
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:54,904
Thank you.

780
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:08,645
Claudius, I think those are trackerjackers.
Am I wrong?

781
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:14,025
- Those things are very lethal.
- Very.

782
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:15,193
For those of you who don't know,

783
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:20,532
trackerjackers are genetically engineered
wasps whose venom causes searing pain,

784
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:26,162
powerful hallucinations,
and in extreme cases, death.

785
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:30,680
Run!

786
01:28:31,724 --> 01:28:33,099
Katniss, go!

787
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:36,686
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!

788
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:52,994
Not only is it lethal,
but the venom of a trackerjacker sting

789
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:55,913
can produce powerful hallucinations.

790
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,728
Mom, don't just sit there and look at me!
Please say something!

791
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,064
Katniss, go!

792
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:07,276
Get out of here! Go!
What are you doing? Go!

793
01:31:08,172 --> 01:31:09,255
Rue?

794
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:15,386
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

795
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,530
You want mine, too?

796
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,200
No, that's okay.

797
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:39,368
Here.

798
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:41,496
Thanks.

799
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,169
How long was I asleep?

800
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:52,173
Couple of days. I changed your leaves twice.

801
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:55,718
Thank you.

802
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,764
So what happened while I was out?

803
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:03,100
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.

804
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:09,398
And the boy from my district?

805
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:13,528
Yeah, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.

806
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,616
Is all of that true?

807
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,784
What?

808
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:21,869
You and him?

809
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,456
So where are Cato and the others?

810
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:28,584
They got all their supplies
down by the lake.

811
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:30,836
It's piled up in this great big pyramid.

812
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,256
That sounds tempting.

813
01:32:49,106 --> 01:32:51,148
Now, this green stuff
is gonna smoke like crazy,

814
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:53,943
so as soon as you light it,
move on to the next fire.

815
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:56,529
Light this one last,
and I'll meet you back over there.

816
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:57,822
Right.

817
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:04,203
And then I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.

818
01:33:04,288 --> 01:33:06,539
We need a signal
in case one of us gets held up.

819
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:07,790
Okay. Like what?

820
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,752
Here. Watch this.

821
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,386
Mockingjays. That's great.

822
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,389
Back home,
we use them to signal all the time.

823
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:29,520
You try.

824
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:40,698
Okay, so if we hear that,

825
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:44,285
it means we're okay
and we'll be back real soon.

826
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:45,620
We're gonna be okay.

827
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,503
Hey, I'll see you for supper.

828
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,965
- Okay.
- Okay.

829
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:29,705
Guys. Guys, look! Over here.
Come on, come on. Look!

830
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:34,919
Let's go.

831
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:38,089
You stay guard and don't move
until we can get back.

832
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:09,954
I want to see if she's gonna figure out
this booby trap.

833
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:12,540
Yes. It seems they've reburied their mines

834
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:15,209
around that big pile of goodies.

835
01:35:27,431 --> 01:35:30,349
She's certainly figured it out, hasn't she?

836
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:40,312
I don't know what happened.

837
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:43,023
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know!

838
01:37:43,567 --> 01:37:44,567
Our stuff!

839
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:45,961
Katniss!

840
01:38:47,547 --> 01:38:49,298
Katniss, help!

841
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:51,926
Katniss!

842
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,933
Katniss! Help!

843
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:03,687
Katniss!

844
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,648
It's okay. It's okay.

845
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:18,243
You're okay. You're okay. You're fine. See?

846
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:49,483
It's okay. You're okay.

847
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:52,444
You're okay. You're okay.

848
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:02,037
Did you blow up the food?

849
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,208
Every bit of it.

850
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:10,713
Good.

851
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:14,633
You have to win.

852
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:25,561
Can you sing?

853
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:30,566
Okay.

854
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:41,910
Deep in the meadow

855
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:46,081
Under the willows

856
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:49,668
A bed of grass

857
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:54,298
A soft green pillow

858
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:58,052
Lay down your head

859
01:40:58,762 --> 01:41:02,056
and close your eyes

860
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:07,936
And when they open, the sun...

861
01:41:56,778 --> 01:42:01,490
I'm sorry.

862
01:44:57,667 --> 01:45:00,210
Don't kill her. You'll just create a martyr.

863
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:01,586
Well, it seems we've already got one.

864
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:04,965
I hear these rumors out of District 11.
This could get away from you.

865
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:06,216
What do you want?

866
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:08,719
You have a lot of anger out there.

867
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:11,847
I know you know how to handle a mob.
You've done it before.

868
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:16,768
If you can't scare them,
give them something to root for.

869
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:18,812
Such as?

870
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:23,442
Young love.

871
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,945
So you like an underdog?

872
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:28,322
Everyone likes an underdog.

873
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:29,656
I don't.

874
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:34,453
Have you been out there?
10? 11 ? 12?

875
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,914
Not personally. No.

876
01:45:37,999 --> 01:45:39,416
Well, I have.

877
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:42,544
There are lots of underdogs.

878
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:44,296
Lots of coal, too.

879
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:47,966
Grow crops, minerals, things we need.

880
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:52,054
There are lots of underdogs.

881
01:45:53,056 --> 01:45:55,015
And I think if you could see them,

882
01:45:56,392 --> 01:45:58,894
you would not root for them either.

883
01:46:01,356 --> 01:46:02,731
I like you.

884
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:07,652
Be careful.

885
01:46:18,331 --> 01:46:20,582
Attention, Tributes. Attention.

886
01:46:20,666 --> 01:46:25,504
The regulations requiring a single victor
have been suspended.

887
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:27,923
From now on, two victors may be crowned,

888
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:31,676
if both originate from the same district.

889
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:34,221
This will be the only announcement.

890
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:36,890
Peeta.

891
01:47:37,827 --> 01:47:40,328
Oh, my God! Peeta! Peeta!

892
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:44,416
Hi.

893
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:49,671
It's okay.

894
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:06,104
What was it?

895
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:07,689
A sword.

896
01:48:09,317 --> 01:48:10,859
It's bad, huh?

897
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:13,695
It's gonna be fine.

898
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:27,834
Katniss.

899
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:32,964
- Katniss.
- No!

900
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:38,094
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna do that.

901
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:47,103
Why not?

902
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:09,918
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

903
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:11,962
They already found me.

904
01:49:16,092 --> 01:49:17,968
We'll just get you some medicine.

905
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:19,886
Katniss, I don't get many parachutes.

906
01:49:20,846 --> 01:49:22,097
We'll figure something out.

907
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:24,516
Like what?

908
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:26,935
Something.

909
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:30,832
- Medicine?
- No. Soup.

910
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:32,667
I'll do it.

911
01:50:43,346 --> 01:50:44,846
That's nice.

912
01:50:46,849 --> 01:50:48,683
You fed me once.

913
01:50:51,771 --> 01:50:53,688
I think about that all the time.

914
01:50:55,483 --> 01:50:57,400
How I tossed you that bread.

915
01:50:57,485 --> 01:50:59,152
- Peeta...
- I should have gone to you.

916
01:50:59,236 --> 01:51:01,488
I should have just gone out in the rain and...

917
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:06,034
You feel hot.

918
01:51:08,663 --> 01:51:10,705
I remember the first time I saw you.

919
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:13,875
Your hair was in two braids instead of one.

920
01:51:15,419 --> 01:51:18,463
And I remember when you sang
in the music assembly.

921
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,924
The teacher said,
"Who knows The Valley Song?"

922
01:51:21,008 --> 01:51:23,134
And your hand shot straight up.

923
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:24,302
Stop.

924
01:51:24,553 --> 01:51:28,390
After that,
I watched you going home every day.

925
01:51:31,394 --> 01:51:32,727
Every day.

926
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:42,404
Well, say something.

927
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:47,909
I'm not good at saying something.

928
01:51:49,829 --> 01:51:51,204
Then come here.

929
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:54,082
Please.

930
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:08,179
Even if I don't make it...

931
01:52:09,098 --> 01:52:10,181
Stop it.

932
01:52:16,439 --> 01:52:18,523
Attention, Tributes. Attention.

933
01:52:19,275 --> 01:52:22,193
Commencing at sunrise,
there will be a feast tomorrow

934
01:52:22,278 --> 01:52:23,862
at the Cornucopia.

935
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:27,031
This will be no ordinary occasion.

936
01:52:27,116 --> 01:52:30,869
Each of you needs something desperately.

937
01:52:30,953 --> 01:52:34,914
And we plan to be generous hosts.

938
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,541
Your medicine.

939
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:37,625
You're not going alone.

940
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,878
Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk.

941
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:42,714
Katniss, you're not gonna risk
your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.

942
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:45,800
You would do it for me. Wouldn't you?

943
01:52:47,762 --> 01:52:49,471
Why are you doing this?

944
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,241
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.

945
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:11,326
Peeta...

946
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:12,619
Please.

947
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:14,621
Stay.

948
01:53:19,752 --> 01:53:20,877
Okay.

949
01:53:22,338 --> 01:53:23,671
I'll stay.

950
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:54,095
Oh, God!

951
01:55:25,461 --> 01:55:27,128
Where's lover boy?

952
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:33,635
I see. You were gonna help him, right?

953
01:55:34,303 --> 01:55:38,890
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad
that you couldn't help your little friend.

954
01:55:39,475 --> 01:55:41,809
That little girl? What was her name again?

955
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:43,770
Rue?

956
01:55:46,398 --> 01:55:48,441
Yeah, well, we killed her.

957
01:55:49,151 --> 01:55:52,195
And now we're gonna kill you.

958
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,452
You kill her?

959
01:55:59,536 --> 01:56:00,745
- No!
- I heard you!

960
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:02,747
- Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!

961
01:56:02,831 --> 01:56:04,082
You said her name!

962
01:56:14,843 --> 01:56:16,010
Just this time, 12.

963
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:18,221
For Rue.

964
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:37,865
Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine.

965
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:39,617
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.

966
01:56:39,702 --> 01:56:41,119
No, you're not. What happened?

967
01:56:41,328 --> 01:56:43,621
The girl from 2, she threw a knife.
I'm okay.

968
01:56:43,706 --> 01:56:45,456
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.

969
01:56:45,541 --> 01:56:47,041
You got worse.

970
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:52,213
I'm sorry.

971
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:55,299
You need some of that, too.

972
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:56,884
I'm okay.

973
01:56:59,888 --> 01:57:01,556
That feels better.

974
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:05,309
Okay. Now you.

975
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:08,229
- I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.

976
01:57:08,313 --> 01:57:09,689
Come on.

977
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:11,065
All right.

978
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:11,584
Hi.

979
01:58:14,713 --> 01:58:16,214
You're so much better.

980
01:58:18,509 --> 01:58:19,842
Oh, my God, Peeta.

981
01:58:20,969 --> 01:58:22,762
I hardly feel anything.

982
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:25,681
We could go home.

983
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,102
We could. We're the only team left.

984
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,354
We could go home.

985
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:37,819
We know Thresh took off.

986
01:58:37,903 --> 01:58:39,695
Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.

987
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:41,823
He's not gonna go someplace
he doesn't know.

988
01:58:41,907 --> 01:58:44,325
Foxface, she could be anywhere.

989
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:50,248
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

990
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:51,958
Okay, I'll take the bow.

991
01:58:54,002 --> 01:58:56,504
I'm just kidding. I'll go pick some stuff.

992
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:21,571
Peeta?

993
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:28,077
Peeta!

994
01:59:28,162 --> 01:59:29,287
Are you okay?

995
01:59:29,371 --> 01:59:31,164
- I heard the cannon. I thought...
- No.

996
01:59:31,248 --> 01:59:34,458
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!

997
01:59:34,543 --> 01:59:35,668
I didn't know.

998
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:38,087
You scared me to death. Damn you.

999
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:43,050
I'm sorry.

1000
01:59:51,143 --> 01:59:53,311
I never even knew she was following me.

1001
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:54,896
She's clever.

1002
01:59:55,147 --> 01:59:56,522
Too clever.

1003
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:01,027
- What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.

1004
02:00:07,117 --> 02:00:08,618
What time is it?

1005
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:10,119
A little after noon.

1006
02:00:10,204 --> 02:00:11,287
Why is it getting so dark?

1007
02:00:11,413 --> 02:00:13,039
Must be in a hurry to end it.

1008
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:19,003
- You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.

1009
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:22,089
Well, that's great.

1010
02:00:22,591 --> 02:00:23,966
- Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.

1011
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:36,687
That's it. That's excellent.

1012
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:50,076
Did you hear that?

1013
02:01:22,401 --> 02:01:23,651
What was that?

1014
02:01:24,778 --> 02:01:26,445
It's the finale.

1015
02:01:41,837 --> 02:01:42,837
Let's go.

1016
02:02:51,907 --> 02:02:52,907
Go.

1017
02:03:10,133 --> 02:03:11,133
Katniss!

1018
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,910
Here!

1019
02:04:50,734 --> 02:04:53,194
Go on. Shoot.

1020
02:04:55,655 --> 02:04:57,865
Then we both go down and you'd win.

1021
02:05:01,203 --> 02:05:05,623
Go on. I'm dead anyway.

1022
02:05:10,629 --> 02:05:12,379
I always was, right?

1023
02:05:14,799 --> 02:05:16,842
I didn't know that till now.

1024
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:22,056
How is that? Is that what they want?

1025
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:26,644
- No.
- No, no.

1026
02:05:28,355 --> 02:05:33,108
I could still do this.

1027
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:35,945
One more kill.

1028
02:05:38,198 --> 02:05:40,741
It's the only thing I know how to do.

1029
02:05:41,076 --> 02:05:43,285
Bring pride to my district.

1030
02:05:46,957 --> 02:05:48,749
Not that it matters.

1031
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:06,433
Please!

1032
02:06:08,186 --> 02:06:09,186
No!

1033
02:06:15,944 --> 02:06:16,944
Please!

1034
02:07:04,492 --> 02:07:06,994
Attention. Attention, Tributes.

1035
02:07:07,162 --> 02:07:10,581
There has been a slight rule change.

1036
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:12,583
The previous revision,

1037
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:15,919
allowing for two victors
from the same district,

1038
02:07:16,004 --> 02:07:18,047
has been revoked.

1039
02:07:19,215 --> 02:07:23,344
Only one victor may be crowned. Good luck.

1040
02:07:24,512 --> 02:07:27,514
And may the odds be ever in your favor.

1041
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,530
Go ahead.

1042
02:07:47,619 --> 02:07:49,495
One of us should go home.

1043
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:53,707
One of us has to die.
They have to have their victor.

1044
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:55,376
No.

1045
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:58,003
They don't.

1046
02:07:59,839 --> 02:08:01,048
Why should they?

1047
02:08:02,175 --> 02:08:03,884
- No!
- Trust me.

1048
02:08:04,886 --> 02:08:06,136
Trust me.

1049
02:08:25,031 --> 02:08:26,448
Together?

1050
02:08:27,992 --> 02:08:29,243
Together.

1051
02:08:30,495 --> 02:08:31,578
Okay.

1052
02:08:32,664 --> 02:08:33,831
One...

1053
02:08:36,084 --> 02:08:37,334
Two...

1054
02:08:43,425 --> 02:08:44,633
Three.

1055
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:49,596
Stop!

1056
02:08:53,059 --> 02:08:56,603
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the winners

1057
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:00,274
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

1058
02:09:27,385 --> 02:09:29,303
They're not happy with you.

1059
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:32,014
Why? Because I didn't die?

1060
02:09:32,474 --> 02:09:34,266
Because you showed them up.

1061
02:09:35,143 --> 02:09:37,936
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't go the way they planned.

1062
02:09:38,021 --> 02:09:40,230
- I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!

1063
02:09:40,857 --> 02:09:43,984
This is serious. Not just for you.

1064
02:09:44,402 --> 02:09:46,528
They don't take these things lightly.

1065
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:40,749
When they ask,
you say you couldn't help yourself.

1066
02:10:40,834 --> 02:10:43,210
You were so in love with this boy

1067
02:10:43,294 --> 02:10:47,381
that the thought of not being with him
was unthinkable.

1068
02:10:47,549 --> 02:10:51,760
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?

1069
02:10:52,262 --> 02:10:56,723
How did you feel
when you found him by that river?

1070
02:11:01,396 --> 02:11:03,647
I felt like the happiest person in the world.

1071
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:10,320
I couldn't imagine life without him.

1072
02:11:16,995 --> 02:11:18,620
And what about you, Peeta?

1073
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,456
She saved my life.

1074
02:11:21,541 --> 02:11:22,583
We saved each other.

1075
02:11:24,335 --> 02:11:28,839
Ladies and gentlemen,
the star-crossed lovers from District 12,

1076
02:11:28,923 --> 02:11:34,595
this year's victors
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!

1077
02:11:51,195 --> 02:11:52,696
Congratulations.

1078
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,114
Thank you.

1079
02:11:59,954 --> 02:12:01,371
What a lovely pin.

1080
02:12:01,456 --> 02:12:03,832
Thank you. It's from my district.

1081
02:12:04,584 --> 02:12:06,877
They must be very proud of you.

1082
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:22,100
So what happens when we get back?

1083
02:12:23,478 --> 02:12:27,397
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.

1084
02:12:32,278 --> 02:12:34,154
I don't want to forget.
