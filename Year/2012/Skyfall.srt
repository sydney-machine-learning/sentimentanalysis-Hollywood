1
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,920
Ronson's down.

2
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,589
He needs medical evac.

3
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,424
<i>Where is it? Is it there?</i>

4
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,508
Hard drive's gone.

5
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,510
<i>Are you sure?</i>

6
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,474
It's gone. Give me a minute.

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,517
<i>They must have it.
Get after them.</i>

8
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,523
I'm stabilizing Ronson.

9
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,858
<i>We don't have the time.</i>

10
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,526
I have to stop the bleeding!

11
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,612
<i>Leave him!</i>

12
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,648
Have you got him?

13
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,608
He's in the black Audi.

14
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,527
What about Ronson?

15
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,694
He's been hit.

16
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,905
We're sending an emergency
evacuation squad.

17
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,615
They'll be too bloody late!

18
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,284
He's seen us.

19
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,829
Medical evac for Ronson
five minutes away.

20
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,170
That's all right.
You weren't using it.

21
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,591
I wasn't using
that one, either.

22
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,305
Keep your head down.

23
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,466
Just get clear!

24
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,053
Tanner, which way?

25
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,846
Keep going.
I can direct you from here.

26
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,514
You both know
what's at stake here.

27
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,183
We can't afford
to lose that list.

28
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,309
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,465
<i>Where are they now?</i>

30
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,009
They appear to be on the
rooftops of the Grand Bazaar.

31
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,272
Take a left. There's a bridge.
You can cut him off.

32
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,554
Down, sir!

33
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,409
What happened?
They're on the train, ma'am.

34
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,702
What do you mean on the train?

35
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,149
I mean,
they're on top of a train.

36
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,645
Well, get after them,
for God's sake!

37
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,529
She's going out of range.

38
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,988
We've lost tracking.
We're blind here.

39
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,990
What's going on?
I'm still with them.

40
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,201
Get me CCTV,
satellite, anything!

41
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,502
<i>What was that?</i>

42
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,087
VW Beetles.

43
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,755
I think.

44
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,366
Bond!
He's uncoupling the cars.

45
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,156
<i>007, are you all right?</i>

46
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,325
Just changing carriages.

47
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,912
<i>What's going on? Report!</i>

48
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,747
It's rather hard
to explain, ma'am.

49
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,540
<i>007's still in pursuit.</i>

50
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,149
Looks like there
isn't much more road.

51
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,234
I don't think I
can go any further.

52
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,270
I may have a shot.

53
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,612
It's not clean.

54
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,364
<i>Repeat, I do not
have a clean shot.</i>

55
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,831
There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm gonna lose them.

56
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,625
Can you get into
a better position?

57
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,335
Negative. There's no time.

58
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,463
Take the shot.

59
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,758
<i>I said take the shot.</i>

60
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,803
I can't! I may hit Bond.

61
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,137
Take the bloody shot!

62
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,870
<i>Agent down.</i>

63
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,233
It's like being summoned
to the headmaster's study.

64
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,736
It's a new Chairman.
Just standard procedure.

65
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,988
Bloody waste of my
time is what I call it.

66
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,157
I'm sorry to have
to deal with such

67
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,242
a delicate subject at
our first encounter.

68
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,329
But, um...

69
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,665
I have to be frank with you.

70
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,834
I think that
would be a good idea.

71
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,881
The Prime Minister's concerned.

72
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,509
Well, you can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.

73
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,678
Have you considered
pulling out the agents?

74
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,180
I've considered every option.

75
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,599
Forgive me,
that sounds like an evasion.

76
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,684
Forgive me, but why am I here?

77
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,773
Three months ago, you lost the
computer drive containing the identity

78
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,358
of almost every
NATO agent embedded in

79
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,903
terrorist organizations
across the globe.

80
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,406
A list which, in the eyes of
our allies, never existed.

81
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,410
So if you'll forgive me, I think
you know why you're here.

82
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,370
Are we to call this
"civilian oversight"?

83
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,041
No, we're to call
this "retirement planning."

84
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,753
Your country has only the
highest respect for you

85
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,880
and your many years of service.

86
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,799
When your current
posting is completed,

87
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,052
you'll be awarded
GCMG with full honors.

88
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,222
Congratulations.

89
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,098
You're firing me.

90
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,643
No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee
the transition period

91
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,479
leading to your voluntary
retirement in two months' time.

92
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,497
Your successor has yet to be
appointed, so we'll be asking you...

93
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,275
I'm not an idiot, Mallory.

94
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,070
I know I can't do
this job forever

95
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,364
but I'll be damned if I'm
going to leave the department

96
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,491
in worse shape than I found it.

97
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,160
M, you've had a great run.

98
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,287
You should leave with dignity.

99
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,582
Oh, to hell with dignity. I'll
leave when the job's done.

100
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,811
Yes?

101
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,480
Now?

102
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,444
Ma'am, alert from Q-Branch. Someone's
trying to decrypt the stolen hard drive.

103
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,947
We're tracing
the encryption signal.

104
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,615
Localizing now.

105
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,120
Centering in the UK.

106
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,540
London.

107
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,625
Get us back to base
as soon as possible.

108
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,134
It's coming from Ml6.

109
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,468
What?

110
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,762
The data packet is
linking to our network.

111
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,473
Correction.
This is behind our firewall.

112
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,100
We should shut down.

113
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,184
No, track it.

114
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,395
We have to know
where it's coming from.

115
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,314
Strip the headers.
Trace the source.

116
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,357
How the hell did they
get into our system?

117
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,318
Getting trace back now.

118
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,490
It appears...

119
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,577
It appears to be
your computer, ma'am.

120
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,329
Shut it down.

121
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,502
What is this?

122
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,859
For God's sake!

123
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,404
Just get out of the way!

124
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,032
Don't you recognize the car?
Madam.

125
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,636
Oh...!

126
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,352
<i>This is CNN Breaking News.</i>

127
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,021
<i>Emergency crews are still
attempting to assess</i>

128
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,524
<i>the damage as
investigators hunt for leads</i>

129
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,734
<i>in what now
appears to be a major</i>

130
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,945
<i>terrorist attack in
the heart of London.</i>

131
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,783
<i>No-one has yet claimed responsibility
for what sources are calling</i>

132
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:16,204
<i>a possible "cyber-terrorist assault"
on the British Secret Service.</i>

133
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,581
<i>Early reports from
the scene indicate</i>

134
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,917
<i>at least six dead,
many more injured,</i>

135
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,045
<i>with victims being evacuated
to local hospitals</i>

136
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,964
<i>within minutes
of the explosion.</i>

137
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,151
It's time to go, ma'am.

138
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,406
I'm going to find
whoever did this.

139
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,373
Where the hell have you been?

140
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,126
Enjoying death.

141
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,047
007 reporting for duty.

142
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,014
Why didn't you call?

143
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,475
You didn't get the postcard?

144
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,727
You should try it some time.
Get away from it all.

145
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,687
It really lends perspective.

146
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,148
Ran out of drink
where you were, did they?

147
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,983
What was it you said?

148
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,486
"Take the bloody shot."

149
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,029
I made a judgment call.

150
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,657
You should have trusted me
to finish the job.

151
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,659
It was the possibility
of losing you

152
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,328
or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.

153
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,331
I made the only decision
I could and you know it.

154
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,667
I think you lost your nerve.

155
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,253
What do you expect,
a bloody apology?

156
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,046
You know the rules of the game.

157
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,589
You've been
playing it long enough.

158
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:32,715
We both have.

159
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:34,926
Maybe too long.

160
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,262
Speak for yourself.

161
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,849
Ronson didn't make it, did he?

162
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,018
No.

163
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,856
So this is it.

164
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,276
We're both played out.

165
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,404
Well, if you believe that,
why did you come back?

166
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,197
Good question.

167
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,784
Because we're under attack.

168
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,788
And you know we need you.

169
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,294
Well, I'm here.

170
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,632
You'll have to be debriefed and
declared fit for active service.

171
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,552
You can only return to duty
when you've passed the tests,

172
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,054
so take them seriously.

173
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,640
And a shower might be in order.

174
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,892
I'll go home and change.

175
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,063
Oh, we've sold your flat,
put your things into storage.

176
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,234
Standard procedure on the death
of an unmarried employee

177
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,611
with no next of kin.

178
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,405
You should have called.

179
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,282
I'll find a hotel.

180
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,909
Well, you're bloody
well not sleeping here.

181
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,454
The assailant hacked into
the environmental control system,

182
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,108
locked out the safety protocols

183
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,612
and turned on the gas, all of which
should have been impossible.

184
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,114
On top of that,
they hacked into her files.

185
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,534
They knew her appointments, knew
she'd be out of the building.

186
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,453
They weren't targeting her.

187
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,039
They wanted her to see it.

188
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,750
Where are we, Tanner?

189
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,168
New digs.

190
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,221
The old building was declared
"strategically vulnerable".

191
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,473
That's putting it mildly.

192
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,976
He was able to breach the most
secure computer system in Britain.

193
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,853
So we're on war footing now.

194
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,856
This was part of
Churchill's bunker.

195
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,566
We're still discovering tunnels

196
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,984
dating back to
the 18th Century.

197
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,487
Quite fascinating,
if it wasn't for the rats.

198
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,155
When do I see M?

199
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,700
Tomorrow you'll see M and
Mallory, too, if you're lucky.

200
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:05,993
Who's Mallory?

201
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,830
The new Chairman of the Intelligence
and Security Committee.

202
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:09,997
Charming man.
I think you and he

203
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,499
are really going to hit it off.

204
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,753
Welcome to the new Ml6.

205
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,897
We've attempted to trace
the computer message, but

206
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,025
it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm,

207
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,694
which bounced the signal
all over the globe

208
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,779
through over
a thousand different servers.

209
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,573
And now that they've
accessed M's codes,

210
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,367
it's only a matter of time before
they're able to decrypt the list.

211
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,953
Q-Branch have been analyzing the
picture but so far nothing.

212
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,373
The general feeling is it's
probably someone from her past.

213
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,042
Perhaps when she was running
things in Hong Kong.

214
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,544
She's no idea
what it all means.

215
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,795
You believe that?

216
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,003
The truth is, we don't have
a clue who took the list

217
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,384
or what they
plan to do with it.

218
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,517
We can always do this later.

219
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,438
You know what? Let's.

220
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,466
I'd like to start with some
simple word associations.

221
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,969
Just tell me the first word
that pops into your head.

222
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,513
For example, I might say "Day"
and you might say...

223
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,639
Wasted.

224
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,228
All right.

225
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,942
Gun.

226
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,028
Shot.
Agent.

227
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,530
Provocateur.

228
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:48,614
Woman.

229
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,657
Provocatrix.

230
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,866
Heart.

231
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:51,993
Target.

232
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,203
Bird.

233
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,538
Sky.

234
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,747
M.

235
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,915
Bitch.

236
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,419
Sunlight.

237
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,670
Swim.

238
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,505
Moonlight.
Dance.

239
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,840
Murder.

240
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,258
Employment.

241
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,552
Country.
England.

242
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,222
Skyfall.

243
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,607
Done.

244
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,865
Well, this is going well.

245
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,498
Get these analyzed.

246
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,084
For her eyes only.

247
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,114
She's ready for you.

248
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,700
I'm sorry, have we met before?

249
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,619
I'm the one who
should say "sorry".

250
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,707
It was only four ribs.

251
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,209
Some of the less vital organs.

252
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,421
Nothing major.

253
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,386
Not enough
excitement in Istanbul?

254
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,138
I've been reassigned.

255
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,306
Temporary suspension
from field work.

256
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,891
Really?
Mmm.

257
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,643
Something to do
with killing 007.

258
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,770
Well, you gave it
your best shot.

259
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,647
That was hardly my best shot.

260
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,066
I'm not sure I
could survive your best.

261
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,985
I doubt you'll get the chance.

262
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,405
Well, do me a favor, will you? If
they do ever let you back out there,

263
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,158
warn me first.

264
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,494
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition,

265
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,496
and then I'll be
back in the field.

266
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,331
That's what you want?

267
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,916
Yes, of course.

268
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,668
It's not for everyone.

269
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,087
Ah, 007. It's this way.

270
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:55,593
In your defense, a moving
target is much harder to hit.

271
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,263
Then you better keep moving.

272
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,692
The whole office
goes up in smoke

273
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,569
and that bloody thing survives.

274
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,573
Your interior decorating tips have
always been appreciated, 007.

275
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,910
007, Gareth Mallory.

276
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,453
I hope I haven't
missed anything.

277
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,038
The PM does
prattle on in a crisis.

278
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,289
Bond.

279
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:26,791
Mallory.

280
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,423
I've just been
reviewing Bond's tests.

281
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:38,052
It seems you've passed...
by the skin of your teeth.

282
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,262
You're back on active service.

283
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,348
Congratulations.

284
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,599
Thank you.

285
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,434
I'll, um...

286
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,644
I'll be outside.

287
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,979
I only have one question.

288
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,565
Why not stay dead?

289
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,278
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.

290
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,657
Not many field agents get
to leave this cleanly.

291
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,450
Do you get out
in the field much?

292
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,163
You don't need to be an
operative to see the obvious.

293
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,791
It's a young man's game.

294
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,585
Look, you've been
seriously injured.

295
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,004
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.

296
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,091
The only shame would be not
admitting it until it's too late.

297
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,178
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

298
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,265
If he says he's ready,
he's ready.

299
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,852
Perhaps you can't see it,
or maybe you won't.

300
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,645
What exactly are you implying?

301
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,647
You're sentimental about him.

302
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,819
As long as I'm head of this department,
I'll choose my own operatives.

303
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,865
Fair enough.

304
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,037
Good luck, 007.

305
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,874
Don't cock it up.

306
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,716
We've analyzed
the shrapnel fragments.

307
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,162
You're lucky it
wasn't a direct hit

308
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,553
or it would have
cut you in half.

309
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,973
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.

310
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,018
Hard to get,
extremely expensive,

311
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,812
and only used by a select few.

312
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,148
Recognize anyone?

313
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,067
Him.

314
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,487
Okay. Name's Patrice.

315
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,032
He's a ghost. No known residence
or country of origin.

316
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,742
So how do we find him?

317
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,078
Well, luckily, we still have one
or two friends left in the CIA.

318
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,997
They're after him for the
Yemeni ambassador's murder,

319
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,874
and they're getting close.

320
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,001
Intel is he's
going to be in Shanghai

321
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,920
in two days time,
probably on a job.

322
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,672
You're to go there and await
further instructions.

323
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,758
If he turns up, he's yours.

324
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,219
Find out who he works for
and who has the list.

325
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,388
Then terminate him, for Ronson.

326
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,015
With pleasure.

327
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,864
Is there anything
else you want to tell me?

328
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,479
No.

329
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,358
Report to the new Quartermaster
for your documentation.

330
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,902
He hasn't set up
shop yet, but Tanner will

331
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,029
put you two together.
Good luck.

332
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,281
Thank you.

333
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,827
007.

334
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,040
You are ready for this?

335
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,459
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,548
I didn't know Bond
passed the tests.

337
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,384
He didn't.

338
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,374
Always makes me feel
a little melancholy.

339
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:59,294
A grand old warship being
ignominiously hauled away for scrap.

340
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,883
The inevitability of time,
don't you think?

341
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,887
What do you see?

342
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,516
A bloody big ship.

343
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,852
Excuse me.

344
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,603
007...

345
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,190
I'm your new Quartermaster.

346
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,610
You must be joking.

347
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,821
Why, because I'm not
wearing a lab coat?

348
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,948
Because you still have spots.

349
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,784
My complexion is
hardly relevant.

350
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,870
Well, your competence is.

351
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,664
Age is no
guarantee of efficiency.

352
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,542
And youth is no
guarantee of innovation.

353
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,669
I'll hazard I
can do more damage

354
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,337
on my laptop
sitting in my pajamas

355
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,048
before my first
cup of Earl Grey

356
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,841
than you can do in
a year in the field.

357
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,551
Oh, so why do you need me?

358
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,221
Every now and then
a trigger has to be pulled.

359
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,807
Or not pulled.

360
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,061
It's hard to know
which in your pajamas.

361
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,649
Q.

362
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,526
007.

363
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,282
Ticket to Shanghai.

364
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,617
Documentation and passport.

365
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,951
Thank you.

366
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,203
And this.

367
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,584
Walther PPK/S 9mm short.

368
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,588
There's a micro-dermal
sensor in the grip.

369
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,258
It's been coded to your palm
print so only you can fire it.

370
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,513
Less of a random killing machine,
more of a personal statement.

371
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,014
And this?

372
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,726
Standard issue
radio transmitter.

373
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,730
Activate it and it
broadcasts your location.

374
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,649
Distress signal.

375
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,443
And that's it.

376
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,280
A gun...

377
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,449
...and a radio.

378
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,787
Not exactly Christmas, is it?

379
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,040
Were you expecting
an exploding pen?

380
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,710
We don't really go
in for that anymore.

381
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,220
Good luck out
there in the field.

382
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,807
And please return the
equipment in one piece.

383
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,730
Brave new world.

384
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,939
Who's got the list?

385
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,197
Tell me!
Who are you working for?

386
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,330
Tanner... He's posted
the first five names.

387
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,500
Their cover's blown. They're in danger.
Get them out now.

388
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,250
Room service.

389
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,720
I didn't order anything.
Not even you.

390
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,722
I've got some new information.

391
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:27,477
Aren't you a little overqualified
to be delivering messages?

392
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,230
It's all part of
the learning curve.

393
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,649
And Q's afraid of flying.

394
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,859
Of course he is.

395
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,738
So whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.

396
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,908
They posted the first
five names on the web.

397
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,285
Well, it was only
a matter of time.

398
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,870
Well, that's just the start.

399
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,915
They're posting five more next
week, and the week after.

400
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,709
It's some kind
of sadistic game.

401
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,758
Cut-throat razor.

402
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,095
How very traditional.

403
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,099
Well, I like to do some things
the old-fashioned way.

404
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,396
Sometimes the old
ways are the best.

405
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,617
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?

406
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,288
M's...

407
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,624
...already
briefed me on the list.

408
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,961
Raising
the tantalizing question

409
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,130
of what you're
really doing here.

410
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,884
My official
directive was to help...

411
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,637
"in any way I can."

412
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,808
Like spying for Mallory.

413
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,479
You know, Mallory's not as bad
as you think.

414
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,482
He's a bureaucrat.

415
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,277
You should do your homework.

416
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,447
Gareth Mallory was
a Lieutenant Colonel...

417
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,283
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern
Ireland, Hereford Regiment.

418
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,869
Spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.

419
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,332
So there's more to
him than meets the eye.

420
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,336
We'll see.

421
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,672
Keep still.

422
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,177
This is the tricky part.

423
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,690
Now that's better.

424
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,068
You look the part now.

425
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,195
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

426
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,490
And what part's that?

427
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,035
Old dog,

428
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,038
new tricks.

429
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,445
Good evening.

430
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:06,988
<i>Evening.</i>

431
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:08,948
Don't touch your ear.

432
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,285
I've got three exits,

433
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:15,121
lots of blind spots.

434
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,290
I've got them covered.

435
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,631
You look
beautiful in that dress.

436
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,425
<i>You don't scrub
up so bad yourself.</i>

437
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,470
It's amazing what one can do
with an extra pair of hands.

438
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,638
<i>You're telling me.</i>

439
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,017
Do you gamble?

440
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,852
<i>I like a little
flutter now and then.</i>

441
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,982
Who doesn't like
to take chances?

442
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,323
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

443
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,492
I'd like to cash
this in, please.

444
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,500
One moment, sir.

445
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,534
Good fortune tonight, sir.

446
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,208
Let's hope so.

447
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,885
With compliments of the house.

448
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,720
Thank you.

449
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,411
Now you can afford
to buy me a drink.

450
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,915
Maybe I'll even stretch to two.

451
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:26,586
I'm guessing I've got four
million euros in here.

452
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,547
Not bad. I like this game.

453
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,799
Why don't we play another?

454
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,927
I don't gamble.

455
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,932
I'm not very lucky.

456
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,268
A little like our
friend in Shanghai.

457
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,609
I've been waiting to see
who would redeem the chip.

458
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:53,487
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.

459
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,907
Did I over-complicate
the plot?

460
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,119
Who doesn't appreciate
the occasional twist, Mr...?

461
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,038
Bond.

462
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,414
James Bond.

463
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,958
Severine.

464
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:10,796
So, Mr. Bond, shall we discuss your
next performance over that drink?

465
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,965
I'd like that.

466
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,137
Will your
friends be joining us?

467
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,975
That, I'm afraid,
is inevitable.

468
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,521
<i>She's pretty.</i>

469
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:28,856
Now, now.

470
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:31,150
<i>If you like that sort of thing.</i>

471
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,527
I'll keep you posted.

472
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,499
Perfect.

473
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,046
Would you mind if I asked
you a business question?

474
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,674
Depends on the question.

475
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,885
It has to do with death.

476
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,223
A subject in which
you're well-versed.

477
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,183
And how would you know that?

478
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,396
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress

479
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,732
with a Beretta 70
strapped to her thigh.

480
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,944
One can never be
too careful when

481
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,863
handsome men in
tuxedos carry Walthers.

482
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,244
I am correct in
assuming you killed Patrice?

483
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,705
Yes.

484
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,250
Might I ask why?

485
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,253
I want to meet your employer.

486
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,059
Be careful what you wish for.

487
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,187
You're scared.

488
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,940
Thank you for the drink,

489
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,569
Mr. Bond.

490
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,412
You put on a good show.

491
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,541
But ever since we sat down,
you haven't stopped

492
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,626
looking at your bodyguards.

493
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,630
Now, three of them
is a bit excessive.

494
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:20,551
They're controlling you.
They're not protecting you.

495
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:25,973
The tattoo on your wrist
is Macau sex trade.

496
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:30,603
You belonged to one of the houses.
What were you? 12? 13?

497
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,315
I'm guessing he
was your way out.

498
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,777
Perhaps you
thought you were in love.

499
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,655
But that was a long time ago.

500
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,118
You know nothing about it.

501
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,789
I know when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.

502
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,169
How much do you
know about fear?

503
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,505
All there is.

504
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,633
Not like this.

505
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,804
Not like him.

506
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,681
I can help you.

507
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:09,809
I don't think so.

508
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:10,976
Let me try.

509
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,814
How?

510
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,650
Bring me to him.

511
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:21,487
Can you kill him?

512
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,655
Yes.

513
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:25,324
Will you?

514
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,827
Someone usually dies.

515
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,375
Perhaps you can.

516
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,802
When I leave,
they're going to kill you.

517
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:49,807
If you survive, I'm on the Chimera.
North harbor.

518
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,393
Berth seven.

519
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,896
We cast off in an hour.

520
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:03,404
Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.

521
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,574
Good luck.

522
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,036
Good luck with that.

523
01:04:58,687 --> 01:04:59,812
Thank you.

524
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,110
Put it all on red.

525
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,656
It's the circle of life.

526
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:35,973
Yes!

527
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,729
It's time to cast off.

528
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:44,857
All right.

529
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:43,248
I like you better
without your Beretta.

530
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,587
I feel naked without it.

531
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:06,980
<i>Good evening.</i>

532
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,567
<i>The controversy surrounding the
Ministry of Defence has escalated today</i>

533
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:14,321
<i>as images of the Husein assassination
continue to circulate.</i>

534
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,407
<i>We should warn you,
some viewers</i>

535
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,283
<i>might find these
images disturbing.</i>

536
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,955
<i>Captain Husein, an Ml6 operative
embedded in the Middle East,</i>

537
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,040
<i>was one of
the five agents exposed</i>

538
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,959
<i>in what is now being considered</i>

539
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:30,629
<i>the greatest internal security
breach in modern British history.</i>

540
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:34,800
<i>The Prime Minister continues to
express public support for Ml6</i>

541
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:37,010
<i>while the opposition has taken
the position...</i>

542
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,865
Has taken the position we're a
bunch of antiquated bloody idiots

543
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,975
fighting a war we don't understand
and can't possibly win.

544
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:45,227
Look, three of my agents
are dead already.

545
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,187
Don't embroil me
in politics now.

546
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,649
The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry.
You'll have to appear.

547
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:54,069
Oh, standing in the stocks at midday?
Who's antiquated now?

548
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,480
For Christ's sake, listen to yourself.
We're a democracy,

549
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,116
accountable to the people
we're trying to defend.

550
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,327
We can't keep working in the shadows.
There are no more shadows.

551
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,246
You don't get this, do you?

552
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,709
Whoever's behind this, whoever's
doing it, he knows us.

553
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:12,087
He's one of us. He comes
from the same place as Bond.

554
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,214
The place you
say doesn't exist.

555
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,009
The shadows.

556
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:57,174
It's not too late.
We could turn back now.

557
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,682
I wouldn't be so sure.

558
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,806
They abandoned it
almost overnight.

559
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:50,227
He made them think there was a
leak at the chemical plant.

560
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:54,940
It's amazing the panic you can
cause with a single computer.

561
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,945
He wanted the island,
so he took it.

562
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:04,116
Does he always
get what he wants?

563
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,577
More than you know.

564
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:10,956
I'm sorry.

565
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,778
Hello, James. Welcome.

566
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,656
Do you like the island?

567
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,536
My grandmother had an island.

568
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:53,206
Nothing to boast of. You could
walk around it in an hour.

569
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,376
But still, it was,
it was a paradise for us.

570
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,504
One summer, we went for a visit

571
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:03,634
and discovered the place had
been infested with rats!

572
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:08,221
They'd come on a fishing boat and
gorged themselves on coconut.

573
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,058
So how do you get
rats off an island? Hmm?

574
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,727
My grandmother showed me.

575
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:17,356
We buried an oil
drum and hinged the lid,

576
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,733
then wired coconut
to the lid as bait.

577
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,864
And the rats would
come for the coconut and...

578
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,530
...they would
fall into the drum.

579
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,743
And after a month, you
have trapped all the rats.

580
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,412
But what do you do then?

581
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:35,374
Throw the drum into the ocean?

582
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,377
Burn it? No.

583
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,754
You just leave it.

584
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:44,091
And they begin to get hungry.

585
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,718
And one by one...

586
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,722
...they start eating each other

587
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:54,226
until there are only two left.
The two survivors.

588
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,020
And then what?
Do you kill them? No.

589
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,941
You take them and release them
into the trees.

590
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:04,111
But now they don't
eat coconut anymore.

591
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:06,780
Now they only eat rat.

592
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:10,784
You have changed their nature.

593
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,162
The two survivors,

594
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,665
this is what she made us.

595
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,461
I made my own choices.

596
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,839
You think you did.

597
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,425
That's her genius.

598
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:32,347
Station H.
Am I right? Hong Kong.

599
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,640
Mm-hmm.

600
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,268
'86 to '97.

601
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:39,229
Back then, I was her favorite.

602
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:42,899
And you're not nearly the agent
I was, I can tell you that.

603
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:49,072
Just look at you, barely held together
by your pills and your drink.

604
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:50,949
Don't forget my
pathetic love of country.

605
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:56,621
You're still clinging to your
faith in that old woman.

606
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,458
When all she does is lie to you.
She never lied to me.

607
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,168
No?
No.

608
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:03,712
What did you score in your
marksmanship evaluation?

609
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,088
70.

610
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:07,799
40.

611
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,262
Did she tell you the psychologist
cleared you for duty?

612
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,681
Yes.
No. No.

613
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:27,611
Medical evaluation: Fail.
Physical evaluation: Failed.

614
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,113
Psychological evaluation:
"Alcohol

615
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,449
and substance
addiction indicated."

616
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,621
"Pathological
rejection of authority

617
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:40,165
based on
unresolved childhood trauma."

618
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,507
"Subject is not
approved for field duty

619
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:51,676
and immediate suspension
from service advised."

620
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:54,054
What is this if not betrayal?

621
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:58,183
She sent you after me knowing you're
not ready, knowing you'll likely die.

622
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,852
Mommy was very bad!

623
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,398
Hmm?

624
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,416
Ooh.

625
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,711
See what she's done to you?

626
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,715
Well, she never
tied me to a chair.

627
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,509
Her loss.

628
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,557
Are you sure this is about M?

629
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,016
It's about her.

630
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:43,228
And you, and me.

631
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,232
You see,
we are the last two rats.

632
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,693
We can either eat each other...

633
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:53,864
Hmm?

634
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,285
...or eat everyone else.

635
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,583
How you're trying to remember
your training now.

636
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,545
What's the regulation
to cover this?

637
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,427
Well, first time
for everything. Yes?

638
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:21,433
What makes you think
this is my first time?

639
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:24,728
Oh, Mr. Bond!

640
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:31,109
All that physical stuff...
So dull, so dull.

641
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,197
Chasing spies...

642
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,365
so old-fashioned!

643
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,621
Your knees must be killing you.

644
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:48,752
England.

645
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,630
The Empire! Ml6!

646
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:54,090
You're living in
a ruin as well,

647
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,967
you just don't know it yet.

648
01:15:57,345 --> 01:16:01,806
At least here there are no old ladies
giving orders and no little...

649
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:03,892
Bip!

650
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,478
Gadgets from
those fools in Q-Branch.

651
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:14,027
If you wanted, you could pick your
own secret missions. As I do.

652
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,824
Name it.

653
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,580
Destabilize a multinational
by manipulating stocks...

654
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:26,748
Bip. Easy.

655
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:31,169
Interrupt transmissions from a
spy satellite over Kabul...

656
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:32,462
Done.

657
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:37,133
Hmm. Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.

658
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:39,844
Or a gas explosion in London.

659
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,514
Just point and click.

660
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,641
Well, everybody needs a hobby.

661
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,315
So what's yours?

662
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,528
Resurrection.

663
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,158
Let me show you something.

664
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,715
Tells a story, doesn't it?

665
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,679
They left
the island so quickly,

666
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,556
they couldn't
decide what to take,

667
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,766
what to leave,
what was important.

668
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:31,021
And seeing this every day reminds
me to focus on the essentials.

669
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:34,899
There's nothing... nothing
superfluous in my life.

670
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:38,737
When a thing is redundant,
it is eliminated.

671
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,082
50-year-old Macallan.

672
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,544
A particular favorite
of yours, I understand.

673
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,090
So, what's the toast?

674
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,720
"To the women we love"?

675
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,263
Hmm.

676
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:15,940
Darling.

677
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,611
Darling, your lovers are here.

678
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:26,618
No, no, no, no.

679
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,162
Stand up straight.
Keep still.

680
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:32,957
And whatever you do,
don't lose your head.

681
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,501
Don't lose...

682
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,169
your head.

683
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,799
Don't lose your head.

684
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:44,594
Time to redeem
your marksmanship scores.

685
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,472
Let's see.

686
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:52,477
Who can be the first to knock
the glass from her head?

687
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:01,319
And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.

688
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,840
Let's see who ends up on top.

689
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:36,688
Oh, I can't believe it.

690
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:40,483
I can't believe it!
Did you really die that day?

691
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:45,321
Is there any, any of
the old 007 left?

692
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:55,206
My turn.

693
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:01,713
I win.
What do you say to that?

694
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,509
It's a waste of good Scotch.

695
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:21,441
What are you going to do now? Take
me back to her? All on your own?

696
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:23,902
Who says I'm on my own?

697
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,256
It's the latest
thing from Q-Branch.

698
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,759
It's called a radio.

699
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,949
All right, time to say hello.

700
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,984
You're smaller than I remember!

701
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:48,987
Whereas I barely
remember you at all.

702
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:52,490
Strange. For me,
it feels just like yesterday.

703
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:55,868
Are you surprised?

704
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:59,414
Not particularly. But then you
always were a slippery one.

705
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,874
Maybe that's why
you liked me so much.

706
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,710
You flatter yourself.

707
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,336
No remorse.

708
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:09,882
Just as I had imagined.

709
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,176
Regret is unprofessional.

710
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,518
"Regret is unprofessional."

711
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:25,690
They kept me for five months in a
room with no air. They tortured me.

712
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,860
And I protected your secrets.
I protected you.

713
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:33,281
But they made me suffer.
And suffer.

714
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,868
And suffer.

715
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,871
Until I realized...

716
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,374
...it was you who betrayed me.

717
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,377
You betrayed me.

718
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,798
So, I had only one thing left.

719
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,220
My cyanide capsule
in my back left molar.

720
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,890
You remember, right?

721
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,063
So I broke the tooth and...

722
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,565
...bit into the capsule.

723
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,567
And it...

724
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,740
It burned all my insides.

725
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,950
But I didn't die.

726
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,915
Life clung to me
like a disease.

727
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,587
And then...

728
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:33,591
I understood why
I had survived.

729
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:39,764
I needed to look in
your eyes one last time.

730
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,769
Well, I hope it was worth it.

731
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,775
Mr. Silva, you're going to be
transferred to Belmarsh Prison

732
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,778
where you'll be
remanded in custody

733
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,613
until the Crown
Prosecution Service

734
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,490
deem you fit to
stand trial for...

735
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,784
Say my name. Say it.

736
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,953
My real name.

737
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,497
I know you remember it.

738
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,959
Your name is on
the memorial wall

739
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,128
of the very
building you attacked.

740
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,630
I will have it struck off.

741
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:17,552
Soon your past will be as
nonexistent as your future.

742
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,471
I'll never see you again.

743
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,309
Do you know what
it does to you?

744
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,731
Hydrogen cyanide?

745
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,829
Look upon your work,

746
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,165
Mother.

747
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,789
Let me know what you recover
from his computer.

748
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:31,375
Has he transmitted the lists? If so, to whom?
I want this resolved.

749
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,543
Yes, ma'am.

750
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,385
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.

751
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,554
He was a brilliant agent.

752
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,725
But he started operating beyond
his brief, hacking the Chinese.

753
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:52,480
The handover was coming up and they
were onto him, so I gave him up.

754
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:55,733
I got six agents in return
and a peaceful transition.

755
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:58,986
We should go, ma'am. Board of
Inquiry begins in 30 minutes.

756
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,489
I want to know
what's on that computer.

757
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,796
Now, looking at
Silva's computer,

758
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:21,217
it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.

759
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:24,303
He's established failsafe
protocols to wipe the memory

760
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,973
if there's any attempt
to access certain files.

761
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:30,518
Only six people in the world could
program safeguards like that.

762
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,645
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?

763
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,981
I invented them.

764
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,485
Right, then.

765
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,990
Let's see what you've
got for us, Mr. Silva.

766
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:47,785
We're in.

767
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,752
Sir, what do you make of this?

768
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:03,593
It's his Omega site.

769
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,304
Most encrypted level he has.

770
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:11,976
Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.

771
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:15,438
Security through obscurity.

772
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:19,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order?

773
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:22,653
I'd like to begin
the proceedings.

774
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,491
We're gathered today
to address important issues

775
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,161
concerning the future
of our national security.

776
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,835
Going somewhere?

777
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:43,549
So you believe your stewardship
of Ml6 during the recent crisis

778
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,009
has been up to scratch?

779
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:48,471
Well, I believe we have
apprehended the responsible party

780
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,348
and are taking
all necessary steps

781
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:53,184
to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.

782
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,560
Oh,

783
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,312
so it's a job well done.

784
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,158
I'm not saying
it's gone perfectly, but...

785
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,942
You'll forgive me for not
putting up the bunting.

786
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,363
I find it rather difficult
to overlook monumental

787
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,363
security breaches
and dead operatives

788
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,282
for which you are almost
single-handedly responsible.

789
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,663
He's using a polymorphic
engine to mutate the code.

790
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:15,998
Whenever I try to
gain access, it changes.

791
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,210
It's like solving a Rubik's
cube that's fighting back.

792
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,384
Stop.

793
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,512
Go in on that.

794
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:37,228
Granborough.

795
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:41,691
Granborough Road. It's an old Tube
station on the Metropolitan Line.

796
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:43,442
Been closed for years.

797
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,071
Use that as a key.

798
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,084
Oh, look, it's a map!

799
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,421
It's London.

800
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:06,799
Subterranean London.

801
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:10,594
What's going on?
Why are the doors open?

802
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,064
Oh, no.

803
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:24,400
Can someone tell me how the
hell he got into our system?

804
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,031
Oh, shit.

805
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:33,159
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

806
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,120
He hacked us.

807
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:45,171
Oh, no.

808
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:54,513
Q.

809
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,348
He's gone.

810
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,902
I'm in a stairwell
below isolation.

811
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,653
<i>Do you read me, Q?</i>

812
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,322
I can hear you.
I'm looking for you.

813
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,542
Got you.
Tracking your location.

814
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:25,795
<i>Just keep moving forward.</i>

815
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,380
<i>Enter the next
service door on your right.</i>

816
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:37,383
<i>If you're through that door,
you should be in the Tube.</i>

817
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,475
I'm in the Tube.

818
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:44,146
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.

819
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,857
<i>He wanted us to capture him, he
wanted us to access his computer.</i>

820
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,567
<i>It was all planned.</i>

821
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:52,196
Blowing up HQ. Knowing
the emergency protocols.

822
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:54,031
Knowing we'd retreat down here.

823
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:58,536
I've got all that. It's what he's
got planned next that worries me.

824
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:02,081
District Line is the closest. There's
a service door on your left.

825
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:04,792
Got it.

826
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:09,713
It won't open.

827
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,090
It will.
Put your back into it.

828
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,634
Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?

829
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:19,014
No, it's stuck.

830
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,393
Oh, good.
There's a train coming.

831
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,233
Hmm. That's vexing.

832
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,539
I'm through.

833
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:45,875
Told you.

834
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,960
We alerted security.
Police are on their way.

835
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:26,790
Where are you now?

836
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:28,167
Temple Tube station.

837
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:29,960
Along with half of London.

838
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,091
Oh, I see you. There you are.

839
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:40,346
I know where I am, Q.
Where's he?

840
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,431
<i>Give us a second.
I'm looking for him.</i>

841
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,016
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

842
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:52,816
<i>There's too many people.
I can't see him.</i>

843
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:55,069
Welcome to rush
hour on the Tube.

844
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,321
Not something
you'd know much about.

845
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,907
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

846
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:10,960
The train's leaving.
Do I get on the train?

847
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:14,213
Don't get on. I'm not sure he's on it.
Give us a minute.

848
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:18,050
<i>Do I get on the train?</i>

849
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,015
Bond.

850
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:26,976
<i>What?</i>
Get on the train.

851
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:42,741
He's keen to get home.

852
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:44,994
Will you open the door, please?

853
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,581
Open the door.

854
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,753
Health and Safety.
Carry on.

855
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:02,594
<i>Where are you?</i>

856
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:04,763
Take a wild guess, Q.

857
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,558
<i>He's in disguise,
dressed as a policeman.</i>

858
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:09,184
Of course he is.

859
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:33,000
Where's he going?
Where's he going?

860
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:43,218
He's going for M. Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.

861
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:47,097
You've overlooked, or chosen
to ignore, hard evidence

862
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:50,851
and consistently,
almost obstinately...

863
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,520
Silva's escaped.
Bond's in pursuit.

864
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:56,357
We need to get you to a
secure location immediately.

865
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,359
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna show her my back.

866
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:00,611
Are we straining
your attention?

867
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:04,490
No. Please, Minister, proceed.

868
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:13,999
Excuse me.

869
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:33,644
Move! Move!

870
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,209
It's as if you
insist on pretending

871
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:41,336
we still live in
a golden age of espionage

872
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:44,298
where human intelligence was
the only resource available.

873
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:47,134
Well, I find this
rather old-fashioned belief

874
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:49,553
demonstrates
a reckless disregard for...

875
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:51,972
Excuse me, Minister,
I don't mean to interrupt,

876
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:54,183
but just for
the sake of variety,

877
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,643
might we actually
hear from the witness?

878
01:36:58,646 --> 01:36:59,897
Of course.

879
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,359
Thank you.

880
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:30,719
Oh!

881
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:34,765
I won't miss next time,
Mr. Silva.

882
01:37:35,225 --> 01:37:38,602
Not bad. Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.

883
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:41,146
Oi. Thank you.

884
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:42,606
You caught me.

885
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:47,444
Now, here's your prize.

886
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:51,114
The latest thing
from my local toy store.

887
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,784
It's called radio.

888
01:37:58,748 --> 01:37:59,748
Whew!

889
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,044
I do hope that wasn't for me.

890
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:05,796
No.

891
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:07,756
But that is.

892
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:00,517
<i>Chairman, Ministers.</i>

893
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:03,145
<i>Today I've repeatedly heard how</i>

894
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,522
<i>irrelevant my
department has become.</i>

895
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,733
Why do we need agents?
The Double-O section?

896
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,860
Isn't it all rather quaint?

897
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:14,489
Well, I suppose I see a
different world than you do.

898
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:19,202
And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.

899
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:25,000
I'm frightened because our enemies
are no longer known to us.

900
01:39:25,627 --> 01:39:27,419
They do not exist on a map.

901
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:30,005
They're not nations.
They are individuals.

902
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:34,843
Look around you.
Who do you fear?

903
01:39:36,012 --> 01:39:38,722
<i>Can you see a face?
A uniform? A flag? No.</i>

904
01:39:40,058 --> 01:39:42,225
<i>Our world is not
more transparent now.</i>

905
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:44,019
It's more opaque.

906
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:45,729
It's in the shadows.

907
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:49,232
That's where we must do battle.

908
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,320
So, before you declare us
irrelevant, ask yourselves,

909
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:57,199
how safe do you feel?

910
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,497
I've just one
more thing to say.

911
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,583
My late husband was a
great lover of poetry.

912
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:08,168
And, um...

913
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:12,589
I suppose some of it sunk in,
despite my best intentions.

914
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:17,761
<i>And here today I remember
this, I think from Tennyson:</i>

915
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:23,433
<i>"We are not now that strength,</i>

916
01:40:23,685 --> 01:40:26,436
<i>which in old days
Moved earth and heaven;"</i>

917
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:30,107
"That which we are, we are;"

918
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,944
<i>"One equal temper
of heroic hearts,"</i>

919
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:37,280
Made weak by time

920
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:39,116
and fate,

921
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:41,952
<i>but strong in will.</i>

922
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,246
To strive, to seek,

923
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:46,581
<i>to find</i>

924
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:48,917
and not to yield."

925
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,292
Go, go, go, go!

926
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:13,376
Move!

927
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:15,378
Move! Go! Move!

928
01:42:55,837 --> 01:42:58,922
007, what the hell are we doing?
Are you kidnapping me?

929
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,757
That would be one
way of looking at it.

930
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:06,012
Too many people are
dying because of me.

931
01:43:06,264 --> 01:43:08,431
If he wants you, he'll
have to come and get you.

932
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:10,976
We've been one step behind
Silva from the start.

933
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:13,228
It's time to get out in front,
change the game.

934
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:15,397
And I'm to be the bait?

935
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:21,570
All right. But just us.
No one else.

936
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:25,448
Q? I need help.

937
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,617
I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?

938
01:43:27,743 --> 01:43:29,661
I've got M.
We're about to disappear.

939
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:31,246
What?

940
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:33,623
I need you to lay a trail of
breadcrumbs impossible to follow

941
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:35,959
for anyone except Silva.
Think you can do it?

942
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,880
I'm guessing this
isn't strictly official.

943
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:41,131
Not even remotely.

944
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:44,342
So much for my promising
career in espionage.

945
01:43:53,102 --> 01:43:55,562
I'm not hiding in there,
if that's your brilliant plan.

946
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:57,355
We're changing vehicles.

947
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:01,610
Trouble with company cars is
they have trackers.

948
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:14,247
Oh, and I suppose that's
completely inconspicuous.

949
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,124
Get in.

950
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:40,857
It's not very comfortable,
is it?

951
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,861
Are you gonna
complain the whole way?

952
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:47,030
Oh, go on then, eject me.
See if I care.

953
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:51,326
Where are we going?

954
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:54,537
Back in time.

955
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:57,958
Somewhere we'll
have the advantage.

956
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,169
It's a fine line.

957
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,797
Make the breadcrumb too small
and he might miss it.

958
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,132
Too big and Silva
will smell a rat.

959
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,885
But do you think even Silva
will be able to spot that?

960
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:11,513
He's the only one who could.

961
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:15,016
Sir.

962
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,560
Oh.

963
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:19,312
What are you doing?

964
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:20,730
We're just... monitoring.

965
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:23,483
Creating a false tracking
signal for Silva to follow.

966
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:26,319
Well, sir, um...
Well, no.

967
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:28,405
Excellent thinking.
Get him isolated.

968
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,490
Send him on the A9.
It's the direct route.

969
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:32,742
You can monitor his progress
more accurately

970
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:34,703
and confirm it with
the traffic cameras.

971
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:36,955
But what if the PM finds out?

972
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,874
Then we're all buggered.

973
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:41,918
Carry on.

974
01:46:24,211 --> 01:46:26,046
Is this where you grew up?

975
01:46:26,714 --> 01:46:27,714
Mm.

976
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:32,177
How old were you
when they died?

977
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:37,974
You know the answer to that.

978
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:42,437
You know the whole story.

979
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:52,906
Orphans always make
the best recruits.

980
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,663
Storm's coming.

981
01:48:00,683 --> 01:48:01,850
Christ.

982
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:02,934
Mm-hmm.

983
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:06,521
No wonder you never came back.

984
01:49:00,284 --> 01:49:01,701
James.

985
01:49:01,911 --> 01:49:03,703
James Bond.

986
01:49:03,954 --> 01:49:04,954
Good God.

987
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:08,082
Are you still alive?

988
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:11,544
It's nice to see you, too.

989
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:16,299
M, this is Kincade.

990
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,635
Gamekeeper here
since I was a boy.

991
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:20,220
Pleased to meet you, Emma.

992
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:21,471
Mr. Kincade.

993
01:49:23,432 --> 01:49:25,072
You're a tad late.
They've sold the place,

994
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:26,559
when they
thought you were dead.

995
01:49:26,644 --> 01:49:28,311
It seems they were wrong.

996
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:30,939
What are you doing here?

997
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:32,982
Some men are coming to kill us.

998
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:35,892
But we're gonna
kill them first.

999
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,239
Then we'd better get ready.

1000
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:43,243
Do we still have a gun room?

1001
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:44,994
Ah.

1002
01:49:46,956 --> 01:49:51,334
They sold the lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.

1003
01:49:51,794 --> 01:49:53,920
They were
shipped out weeks ago.

1004
01:49:54,463 --> 01:49:55,838
There's just...

1005
01:49:56,507 --> 01:50:00,009
your father's
old hunting rifle.

1006
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:02,971
We couldn't let that go.

1007
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,353
And this is what we've got.

1008
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:15,024
There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.

1009
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,694
But if all else fails,

1010
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:22,365
sometimes the old
ways are the best.

1011
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:30,873
So who is it we're
supposed to be fighting?

1012
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:33,543
No "we" in it, Kincade.

1013
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:35,628
This is not your fight.

1014
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:38,881
Try and stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.

1015
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:43,928
Now, remember what I taught you.
Don't let it pull to the left.

1016
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:47,223
I'll do my best.

1017
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:57,942
What did you say
you did for a living?

1018
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:14,959
Emma!

1019
01:51:15,753 --> 01:51:17,378
I brought you some things.

1020
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:22,759
The nights get cold here.

1021
01:51:23,218 --> 01:51:25,178
Thank you, Mr. Kincade.

1022
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:27,678
It's a beautiful old house.

1023
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:28,806
She is.

1024
01:51:29,767 --> 01:51:34,687
And like all great ladies,
she still has her secret ways.

1025
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:36,314
Let me show you this.

1026
01:51:41,612 --> 01:51:42,779
Priest's hole?

1027
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:45,448
Yeah, from Reformation times.

1028
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:48,117
The tunnel leads
under the moor.

1029
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:50,411
If you get in danger,
this is the place to come.

1030
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:56,376
The night I told him his parents had
died, he hid in here for two days.

1031
01:51:58,796 --> 01:51:59,962
When he did come out...

1032
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:02,298
he wasn't a boy anymore.

1033
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:06,094
Eh. Must get on.

1034
01:54:06,507 --> 01:54:08,424
I fucked this up, didn't I?

1035
01:54:10,135 --> 01:54:11,302
No.

1036
01:54:13,222 --> 01:54:14,931
You did your job.

1037
01:54:20,062 --> 01:54:21,729
I read your obituary of me.

1038
01:54:23,482 --> 01:54:24,607
And?

1039
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:25,900
Appalling.

1040
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:28,236
Yeah, I knew you'd hate it.

1041
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:32,865
I did call you "an exemplar
of British fortitude".

1042
01:54:33,742 --> 01:54:35,409
That bit was all right.

1043
01:54:40,624 --> 01:54:41,749
You ready?

1044
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:45,419
I was ready before
you were born, son.

1045
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,208
Welcome to Scotland.

1046
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:24,120
You dropped something.

1047
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:51,689
You hurt?

1048
01:57:52,566 --> 01:57:54,900
Only my pride.
I never was a good shot.

1049
01:58:00,907 --> 01:58:03,868
He's not here.

1050
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:40,237
Always got to make an entrance.

1051
01:58:41,823 --> 01:58:43,866
You two, go to the kitchen.
Now.

1052
01:59:08,058 --> 01:59:09,058
Get behind the arch!

1053
01:59:52,519 --> 01:59:54,061
Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.

1054
02:01:15,977 --> 02:01:20,189
Everyone, listen to me! Don't
you dare touch her. She's mine.

1055
02:01:37,207 --> 02:01:38,727
Can your friend
come out and say hello?

1056
02:02:46,526 --> 02:02:48,610
Come on. This way.

1057
02:03:46,461 --> 02:03:48,504
I always hated this place.

1058
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:00,349
Are you getting warm?

1059
02:05:29,314 --> 02:05:31,481
Just make sure Bond's dead!

1060
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:37,070
Now it's me and her.

1061
02:07:35,189 --> 02:07:38,650
You see what comes of all this
running around, Mr. Bond?

1062
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:42,070
All this jumping and fighting.

1063
02:07:42,238 --> 02:07:44,114
It's exhausting!

1064
02:07:47,285 --> 02:07:48,744
Relax.

1065
02:07:50,413 --> 02:07:52,164
You need to relax.

1066
02:08:10,975 --> 02:08:13,769
Ah, well...
Mother's calling.

1067
02:08:15,396 --> 02:08:17,522
I'll give her
a goodbye kiss for you.

1068
02:08:36,918 --> 02:08:38,960
Oh, my God.

1069
02:10:36,621 --> 02:10:38,497
Of course.

1070
02:10:38,915 --> 02:10:40,540
It had to be here.

1071
02:10:42,919 --> 02:10:44,544
It had to be this way.

1072
02:10:46,005 --> 02:10:47,464
Thank you.

1073
02:10:47,590 --> 02:10:49,299
I can't find it no...
Don't.

1074
02:10:53,262 --> 02:10:55,847
Please. Don't.

1075
02:11:11,155 --> 02:11:13,573
You're hurt. You're hurt.

1076
02:11:17,828 --> 02:11:22,415
What have they done to you?

1077
02:11:54,907 --> 02:11:56,449
Free both of us.

1078
02:11:56,909 --> 02:11:58,618
Free both of us...

1079
02:11:59,954 --> 02:12:01,204
with the same bullet.

1080
02:12:02,957 --> 02:12:05,834
Do it.

1081
02:12:07,962 --> 02:12:09,170
Only you can do it.

1082
02:12:09,964 --> 02:12:11,214
Do it.

1083
02:12:27,023 --> 02:12:28,273
Ah!

1084
02:12:54,216 --> 02:12:56,009
Last rat standing.

1085
02:13:06,270 --> 02:13:09,272
007. What took you so long?

1086
02:13:09,565 --> 02:13:12,525
Well, I got into
some deep water.

1087
02:13:14,445 --> 02:13:15,445
Oh!

1088
02:13:28,542 --> 02:13:30,627
I suppose it's...

1089
02:13:31,045 --> 02:13:33,380
too late to make a run for it?

1090
02:13:39,553 --> 02:13:41,471
Well, I'm game if you are.

1091
02:13:51,899 --> 02:13:54,234
I did get one thing right.

1092
02:15:18,527 --> 02:15:19,778
Wow.

1093
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:23,198
I didn't even know
you could come up here.

1094
02:15:24,533 --> 02:15:26,367
Hate to waste a view.

1095
02:15:26,744 --> 02:15:28,453
I can see why.

1096
02:15:30,247 --> 02:15:33,124
I thought you were going
back out on active service.

1097
02:15:34,627 --> 02:15:36,419
I declined.

1098
02:15:38,088 --> 02:15:39,464
You said it yourself,

1099
02:15:40,049 --> 02:15:41,800
fieldwork's not for everyone.

1100
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:45,637
If it helps,
I feel a lot safer.

1101
02:15:50,935 --> 02:15:52,811
Her will was read today.

1102
02:15:53,729 --> 02:15:55,230
She left you this.

1103
02:16:07,493 --> 02:16:10,370
Maybe it was her way of telling
you to take a desk job.

1104
02:16:11,247 --> 02:16:12,997
Just the opposite.

1105
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:17,502
Thank you.

1106
02:16:36,438 --> 02:16:38,982
You know, we've never formally
been introduced.

1107
02:16:42,653 --> 02:16:44,112
Well, my name's Eve.

1108
02:16:44,905 --> 02:16:46,322
Eve Moneypenny.

1109
02:16:47,283 --> 02:16:49,868
Well, I look forward to our
time together, Miss Moneypenny.

1110
02:16:50,369 --> 02:16:54,539
Me, too. I'm sure we'll have
one or two close shaves.

1111
02:16:56,917 --> 02:16:57,959
Morning, 007.

1112
02:16:58,085 --> 02:16:59,127
Good morning, Tanner.

1113
02:16:59,545 --> 02:17:00,545
He'll see you now.

1114
02:17:15,978 --> 02:17:17,312
How's the arm, sir?

1115
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:20,440
What? Oh, it's fine.

1116
02:17:20,566 --> 02:17:21,816
It'll get better.

1117
02:17:21,942 --> 02:17:24,819
All pretty shocking for
someone unused to fieldwork.

1118
02:17:27,823 --> 02:17:31,326
So, 007...
Lots to be done.

1119
02:17:35,497 --> 02:17:37,415
Are you ready to
get back to work?

1120
02:17:39,335 --> 02:17:41,419
With pleasure, M.

1121
02:17:43,672 --> 02:17:45,673
With pleasure.
