1
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,876
<i>United 1523, did you
hear your company, did you hear…</i>

2
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:48,911
<i>…couple of minutes ago, screaming.</i>

3
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:50,321
<i>We did hear that, uh, yelling too.</i>

4
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:52,267
<i>Yes I did, 797, and, uh,
we couldn’t tell what it was either.</i>

5
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,949
<i>…trying to figure out
what’s going on… United 93, Cleveland.</i>

6
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,149
<i>American Airlines emergency
line, please state your emergency.</i>

7
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:58,346
<i>The flight attendant
is advising our reps that the pilot…</i>

8
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:59,969
<i>Everyone’s been stabbed
And um, I think there’s Mace</i>

9
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:02,210
<i>…that we can’t breathe. I
dont know I think we’re getting hijacked</i>

10
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,765
<i>Hijacked aircraft
headed towards New York.</i>

11
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:04,987
<i>Is this real world or exercise?</i>

12
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:06,210
<i>No, this is not an exercise.</i>

13
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:07,922
<i>Can anybody get up to the cockpit?</i>

14
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:10,429
<i>What’s going
on, Betty? Betty, talk to me.</i>

15
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:12,261
<i>A plane’s crashed
into the World Trade Center…</i>

16
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,031
<i>I think we might have lost her.</i>

17
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:15,599
<i>Hey, Ma, sure that you’ve heard…</i>

18
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:18,332
<i>that a plane
crashed into World Trade Center One.</i>

19
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,274
<i>Baby, you have
to listen to me carefully.</i>

20
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:22,020
<i>I’m on a plane that’s been hijacked.</i>

21
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,829
<i>I hope to be able
to see your face again, baby.</i>

22
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:27,199
<i>I love you! Goodbye!</i>

23
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,668
<i>…of another incoming
plane. We may have to take cover.</i>

24
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:40,172
<i>Are they gonna
be able to get somebody up here?</i>

25
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:41,885
<i>Of course,
ma’am, we’re coming up to you.</i>

26
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:45,002
<i>Well, there’s no one here
yet and the floor is completely engulfed</i>

27
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,909
<i>We’re on the
floor and we can’t breathe.</i>

28
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:49,147
<i>Hold for one second, please
I’m gonna die, aren’t I?</i>

29
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:51,286
<i>— No, no, no, no, no, no.
— I think I’m gonna die.</i>

30
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,797
<i>Ma’am, ma’am, now, I’m gonna die.</i>

31
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,710
<i>Look, stay calm,
stay calm, stay calm, stay calm.</i>

32
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:56,743
<i>Please, God…</i>

33
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,114
<i>You’re doing a good
job, ma’am, you’re doing a good job.</i>

34
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,991
<i>No, it’s so hot, I’m burning up.</i>

35
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:03,955
<i>…fine, they’re gonna come get you.</i>

36
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:06,044
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

37
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:08,206
<i>Oh, my God…</i>

38
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,121
I own you, Ammar.

39
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:32,627
You belong to me.

40
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,382
Look at me.

41
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,909
You don’t look at me when
I talk to you, I hurt you!

42
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:44,450
You step off this mat, I hurt you!

43
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:48,993
If you lie to me, I’m gonna
hurt you! Now! Now, look at me!

44
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:52,427
Look at me, Ammar!

45
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:56,788
Come on.

46
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,079
— Nobody talks to him.
— Roger that.

47
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,710
Are we gonna board
these windows up or what?

48
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:36,014
Just off the plane from Washington…

49
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:40,618
Rocking your best suit for
your first interrogation,

50
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,208
and you get this guy.

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,232
— They’re not always this intense.
— I’m fine.

52
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,011
Well, just so you know,

53
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:54,635
it’s gonna take a while.
He has to learn how helpless he is.

54
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,276
Come on, let’s get a coffee.

55
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,282
No, we should go back in.

56
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:11,961
You know, it’s no shame if you
wanna watch from the monitor.

57
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:17,459
All right.

58
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:23,915
Might wanna put this on.

59
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:25,724
You’re not wearing one?

60
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,918
Is he ever getting out?

61
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:32,032
Never.

62
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:33,651
Let’s go.

63
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,469
Right now,

64
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,915
all this is about, simply,

65
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:55,633
is you coming to terms
with your situation.

66
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,017
It’s you and me, bro.

67
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:02,050
I want you to understand that I know you…

68
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,775
that I’ve been studying and
following you for a very long time.

69
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,216
That I could’ve had you killed
in Karachi, but I didn’t.

70
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:14,487
I let you live, so that
you and I could talk.

71
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,574
Then you beat me when my hands are tied.

72
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,249
So I won’t talk to you.

73
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,316
Well, life isn’t always fair, my friend.

74
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:24,856
Did you really think…

75
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,793
that when we got you,
“I would get a nice fucking guy”?

76
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:33,096
You’re a mid-level guy. You’re
a garbageman in the corporation!

77
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,689
What should I respect you, huh?

78
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:38,498
— Why?
— And you’re a moneyman.

79
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:41,651
Paperboy.

80
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:46,856
A disgrace to humanity. You and your
uncle murdered 3,000 innocent people.

81
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:49,542
Yeah.

82
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,382
I have your name…

83
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:58,150
on a $5,000 transfer via
Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker.

84
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,220
And you got popped…

85
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:07,713
with 150 kilograms of high
explosives in your house!

86
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:12,249
And then you dare question me?

87
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:19,659
Come on, man, I’m fucking with you.

88
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,779
No, I don’t want to talk about 9/11 yet.

89
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:29,385
What I want to focus
on is the Saudi group.

90
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:38,304
That, there, is Hazem al-Kashmiri.

91
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,729
And I know this dude is
up to some serious shit.

92
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,936
What I want from you is his Saudi e-mail.

93
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,356
Ammar, bro, I know
that you know this dude.

94
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,988
Just give me his e-mail, and
I will—I will give you a blanket.

95
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,595
I will give you a blanket
and some solid food.

96
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:01,249
I know that you know him.

97
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,163
I told you before, I won’t talk to you.

98
00:07:10,984 --> 00:07:12,614
Have it your way. Let’s go.

99
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:15,337
Come on.

100
00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:22,000
When you lie to me, I hurt you.

101
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:43,496
Grab me the bucket.

102
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,809
— Huh?
— C’mon, grab the bucket.

103
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:53,544
Put some water in it.

104
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,241
Come on, let’s go!

105
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:02,855
Come on, give it to me.

106
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:11,150
Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef.
You guys met in Iran back in the nineties.

107
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:12,948
I don’t know!

108
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:16,652
Fuck you!

109
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:25,092
I want the e-mails of the
rest of the Saudi group.

110
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,377
Give me one e-mail and I will stop this.

111
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:31,045
Who’s in the Saudi group?

112
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:32,775
And what’s the target?

113
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:36,331
Where was the last
time you saw bin Laden?

114
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:39,896
Where was the last time
you saw bin Laden, huh?

115
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:43,030
You know when you lie to me, I hurt you.

116
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,321
This is what defeat looks like, bro.

117
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,214
Your jihad is over.

118
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:01,104
Get him up.

119
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,047
Try to understand the concept here.

120
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:16,711
Okay, I have time. You don’t.

121
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:19,521
I have other things to do but you don’t.

122
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:27,134
It’—it’s cool that you’re
strong. I respect it, I do.

123
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:32,516
But in the end, everybody
breaks, bro. That’s biology.

124
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,955
Can you open the trunk, ma’am?

125
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:27,777
It’s clear.

126
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,661
How’d it go the other night?

127
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,850
It was good. I mean the local cops
need a little tactical help, but…

128
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,790
he’s tier-fucking-one, baby.
That’s your money maker right there.

129
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,343
And this is the guy that’s KSM’s nephew.

130
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:27,528
— Yeah.
— And what’s his issue?

131
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:28,533
He’s being a dick.

132
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:30,844
If he’s trying to outsmart you,
why don’t you tell him about your PhD?

133
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:33,478
Yeah. No, but I am gonna have to
turn up the heat on this asshole.

134
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:35,522
He needs to give up the Saudi group now.

135
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,403
He’s gotta have that,
given the family ties.

136
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:40,277
He’s tight with his uncle. He’s
got his prints all over 9/11 money.

137
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:42,835
He’s got ‘em in his head,
he needs to disclose ‘em.

138
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:45,184
Good.

139
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:48,576
Bill, she’s good to go. I’ll
get her the right one tomorrow.

140
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:52,888
Was I lying or what?

141
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,863
Uh, Maya, this is Joseph Bradley,
our illustrious station chief.

142
00:11:57,898 --> 00:11:59,264
Joe and I did Iraq together.

143
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:01,581
— It’s nice to meet you.
— You too, sir.

144
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:04,161
— How’s your flight?
— Fine.

145
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,126
Um, she’s been having a great time
since she got in, isn’t that right?

146
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,430
Good. How do you like Pakistan so far?

147
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:10,827
It’s kinda fucked up.

148
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,261
You volunteered for this, didn’t you?

149
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:14,268
No.

150
00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:22,009
Third floor, northeast corner.

151
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,224
You don’t think she’s a little
young for the hard stuff?

152
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:34,941
— Washington says she’s a killer.
— Hmm.

153
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,025
Children’s crusade, huh?

154
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,714
They wanna put the next
generation on the field.

155
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:40,679
Listen, I’ve got a meeting
with ISI in twenty minutes.

156
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,430
They’re slow-rolling us on Lahore,
you might wanna bitch about that.

157
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:11,132
Did I tell you this? That, uh, this dude

158
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,103
in Malaysia, he tells a Malaysian
station that his nephew

159
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,138
— works with a guy, who knows a guy…
— Aww, here we go.

160
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:22,285
No, hold on. He goes to a big
feast in Bangkok, about a year ago.

161
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:25,609
Guest of honor: Osama bin Laden.

162
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:28,734
— Except if it was Tupac there…
— This is worth 5 million bucks.

163
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,101
You know we gonna have to chase it down.

164
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,269
He’s like, “Hey, that’s
me, man. No job too small.”

165
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,295
That’s why I have a
gift for you, my friend.

166
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,021
Everyone, Agent Maya. Maya, everyone.

167
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,795
Please don’t ask her how
it’s going with Ammar,

168
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,166
’cause she’s not gonna fucking tell you.

169
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:41,954
Ammar is withholding.

170
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:46,656
Washington assesses Abu Faraj
as officially the new “Number 3”.

171
00:13:46,671 --> 00:13:48,265
He’s the best man for it.

172
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:53,936
Uh, yeah, the London station’s already
asking if he’s contacting anybody in the UK.

173
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:55,612
Like we’re just keeping it from them?

174
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:56,282
Yeah.

175
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:59,317
Jordanians are being really
helpful with Ammar’s transit papers.

176
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,713
Any imminent threats in here?

177
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:04,045
Oh, we’ve one on the consulate,
the Marriott, it’s low-security,

178
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:08,131
um, and they’ve got Maj Khan talking
about our gas stations in the US.

179
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:09,930
And that’s a conversation?

180
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:13,913
Honestly, there’s 600 questions in
there. I’d do Heathrow, the Saudis.

181
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:16,451
Does it matter what Faraj
thinks about Heathrow?

182
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:18,273
How much latitude does
he get to pick targets?

183
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,817
Um, I think he’ll give up the
Saudis, but Heathrow’s gonna be tough.

184
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:23,638
Anyway, uh… anything from last night?

185
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:25,948
Qatar Base Six have a bead
on the Arabs that escaped,

186
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:28,995
they’re meeting with ISI this afternoon,
hopefully set up a raid down there.

187
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:29,932
Great.

188
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:34,167
And Lahore reporting, ISI was
painfully slow last night, again.

189
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:36,076
They’re beginning to think
it’s not incompetence.

190
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:40,038
Okay, agree. I spoke to the chief
about that. Anything on bin Laden?

191
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:41,999
Uh, farmer on the Afghan
border near Tora Bora…

192
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,620
reports a diamond-shaped
pattern in the hills,

193
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:45,950
tall male in the center of the
diamond, flanked by four guards,

194
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,059
consistent with UBL’s movements.

195
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:49,489
That’s supposed to be his Royal Guard.

196
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:51,421
No, that’s pre-9/11 behavior.

197
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:54,323
We have no reason to believe
he’s changed security tactics.

198
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,525
We invaded Afghanistan, that’s a reason.

199
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:00,355
Hey, boss. I got a guy,

200
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,658
for 5,000 bucks, he can set up a
taxi stand, and snoop around a bit.

201
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:06,951
No, don’t need him. Sorry, the
diamond sighting is bullshit.

202
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:11,054
Uh, see if the Paks will send someone
to talk to the farmer. Anything else?

203
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:12,639
No?

204
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:16,147
All right, let’s put some runs
on the board against Faraj, okay?

205
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,139
Talk to the case officers who didn’t see
fit to make it today, and “thank” them.

206
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,571
Tora Bora, yeah?

207
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:24,442
— Uh-huh.
— Good.

208
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:21,182
Come on, here we go.

209
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:22,929
Here we go.

210
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:32,701
All right, let’s just, uh…
Let’s take it easy today, huh?

211
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:55,567
You hungry?

212
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,027
Food in here sucks, so
I brought you some of this.

213
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:09,917
Pretty good, huh?

214
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:21,789
Richard Reid.

215
00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:25,046
Oh, man, I was thinking about him.

216
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,223
The guy gets a bomb in a shoe on
a plane. Un-fucking-believable.

217
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:31,102
You know him, don’t you?

218
00:17:35,947 --> 00:17:36,844
Yes.

219
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:40,124
I’m glad you said that.

220
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:48,034
Okay, uh, I got an e-mail from you to
him, with all your comms for years, bro.

221
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:51,956
Who, um…

222
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:55,240
Who else is in your Saudi group?

223
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,474
I just handed out some cash for them.

224
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,177
I didn’t know who the guys were.

225
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:10,793
When you lie to me, I hurt you.

226
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:14,160
Please.

227
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:26,228
I believe you. I do, I believe you.

228
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:32,703
It’s good, huh?

229
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,776
Do you want the water again?

230
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,373
Or do you want something else?

231
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:52,577
— Water?
— Please.

232
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:55,229
Just… give me a name.

233
00:18:57,828 --> 00:19:02,825
I don’t know!

234
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:04,002
Come on, let’s go!

235
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:07,728
Bring him up.

236
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:09,029
Here we go!

237
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,600
You see how this works?

238
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:19,500
You don’t mind if my female colleague
here checks out your junk, do you?

239
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:20,947
No? Good.

240
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:25,032
Dude, you shit your pants?

241
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:28,354
You stay here, I’ll be back.

242
00:19:42,603 --> 00:19:44,556
Your friend is an animal.

243
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:48,810
Please, help me.

244
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:51,847
Please.

245
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:01,532
You can help yourself by being truthful.

246
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,244
This is a dog collar.

247
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:23,591
— No!
— Hang on.

248
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:30,583
You determine how I treat you.

249
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:38,335
Come on.

250
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,969
I got you.

251
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:50,673
Come on.

252
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:53,760
Come on.

253
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,171
You’re my dog, I gotta walk you.

254
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:00,100
What the fuck do you
think is going on, Ammar?

255
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:04,048
Walid has already told
me that you know, hmm?

256
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,568
Here we go.

257
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:14,536
This box here. This box sucks.

258
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:17,279
And I’m gonna put you in it.

259
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,200
When is the attack?

260
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:28,739
When is the attack?

261
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,041
— S…
— What?

262
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:35,339
— What?
— “Ahad.” (Sunday)

263
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:39,164
Sunday, where? Whoa… Sunday, where?

264
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:43,182
Sunday. This Sunday or next Sunday?

265
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:47,402
Where?

266
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:51,009
What?

267
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,911
Come on, Ammar, is it Sunday or Monday?

268
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,530
Partial information will be
treated as a lie. Come on, let’s go.

269
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:02,769
Come on, which day is it?

270
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:06,076
Partial information… You
gonna go in the box, huh?

271
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,537
Partial information is
treated as a lie! Let’s go!

272
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:14,380
— Saturday!
— In the box you go!

273
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:16,930
— Sunday!
— Almost.

274
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:19,484
Monday!

275
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:24,105
— Tuesday!
— Huh? There we go.

276
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:26,975
— Friday!
— Come on, let’s go! Come on!

277
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:31,465
— Hang on…
— Sunday.

278
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,986
— Monday.
— Shh…

279
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:39,731
Thursd…

280
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:42,853
Ammar, which day is it?

281
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,872
Which day?

282
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:51,602
Frid…

283
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:57,223
— Ammar, which day?
— Thursd…

284
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:01,488
Frid…

285
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:21,228
“Yalla! Yalla! Yalla!” (Let’s go!)

286
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:26,359
“Yalla! Yalla! Yalla!”

287
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:31,617
<i>…attack against
westerners and foreigners.</i>

288
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:33,835
<i>When you look at the
break-up of casualties,</i>

289
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,714
<i>you can see that non-muslims were
killed, and so were Americans…</i>

290
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:41,388
You don’t worry about the Saudis,
they’ll take care of business.

291
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:43,185
Yeah, now.

292
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:47,075
You warned them, they
didn’t take you seriously.

293
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:48,877
This is what happens. It’s not on you.

294
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,076
Oh, and who said that, huh? Zayid? Fuck
him. This is on me. Ammar is on me,

295
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:55,986
— No, no, no. Now, you had what, days?
— and it’s on her. And, we do not,

296
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:58,275
— Brief custody, unresponsive ally?
— we cannot let this be a win–win for AQ

297
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:00,057
The way you do this, is look ahead.

298
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,800
London, Heathrow, mass casualties.
The plan is still active.

299
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:04,738
Ammar doesn’t have a
clue about what happened.

300
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,718
— Oh, he knows.
— How?

301
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:10,028
Oh, you have to be really careful with
people in KSM’s circle, they’re devious.

302
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:12,170
He’s not gonna talk about
attacks in the homeland.

303
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,433
He’s gonna withhold operational
details on the KSM network

304
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,470
and probably bin Laden.

305
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:19,664
But he’s been in complete isolation.

306
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:22,355
He doesn’t know we’ve failed.
We could tell him anything.

307
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:23,677
What? Bluff him?

308
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:27,021
He hasn’t slept in. He’s clueless.

309
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,383
You don’t remember, do you?

310
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:37,509
Well, short-term memory loss is a
side effect of sleep deprivation,

311
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:38,951
so it should come back to you.

312
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:43,873
I don’t know.

313
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:47,220
How can I remember?

314
00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:50,377
After we kept you awake for 96 hours you…

315
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:52,743
gave us the names of
some of your brothers,

316
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:55,696
and you helped save the lives
of a lot of innocent people.

317
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:58,505
Which is a smart thing to do when
you’re starting to think for yourself.

318
00:24:58,533 --> 00:24:59,274
Mm–hm.

319
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:01,116
Come on, eat up, man.

320
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:07,286
Some hummus, tabbouleh, don’t know
what that is, some figs. You earned it.

321
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:16,577
So uh you flew via Amman to Kabul, yeah?

322
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:19,603
Hang out with your uncle.

323
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,525
Mukhtar.

324
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:26,008
— How did you know that?
— I told you, man, I know you.

325
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:29,597
All right, you got me.
You did, you got me.

326
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:31,595
Flight manifests.

327
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:35,385
It must be pretty fucked
up for you guys after 9/11.

328
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:38,976
And what did you do, um, what
did you do after the invasion?

329
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:40,932
Before you went back to Pesh?

330
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,175
After 9/11, we had to choose.

331
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:47,174
Fight to protect our turf or run.

332
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:49,126
And you chose to fight, yeah?

333
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,994
We wanted to kill Americans.

334
00:25:53,643 --> 00:25:54,382
Yeah.

335
00:25:54,906 --> 00:25:59,692
We tried to get into Tora Bora, but the
bombing was too high. We couldn’t cross.

336
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:03,075
I’m sorry, who’s the
“we” in that sentence?

337
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:09,011
Me, and some other guys who
were hanging around at that time.

338
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:11,782
You know, I can always go
and eat with some other dude,

339
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:13,547
hang you back up to the ceiling.

340
00:26:16,893 --> 00:26:18,552
Hamza Rabia.

341
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,358
Khabab al-Masri.

342
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:33,736
And Abu Ahmed.

343
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:41,142
Who’s Abu Ahmed? I’ve
heard of the other guys.

344
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,220
He was a computer guy
with us at the time.

345
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:52,053
After Tora Bora, I went
back to Pesh, as you know.

346
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,060
Mm-hm.

347
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:56,190
And they went north, I think, to Kunar.

348
00:26:56,242 --> 00:26:57,559
What’s his family name?

349
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,523
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

350
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:05,934
Abu Ahmed means “father
of Ahmed”, it’s a kunya.

351
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:10,090
Ammar, I know the difference between
a war name and an Arabic name.

352
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:11,229
She got you there, dude.

353
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:16,133
I swear to you both,
I don’t know his family name.

354
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:21,521
I would have never asked him something
like that. It’s not how my uncle worked.

355
00:27:21,592 --> 00:27:22,469
I know.

356
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:26,792
My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden.

357
00:27:29,976 --> 00:27:34,779
Um, I did see him, once,
about a year ago, in Karachi.

358
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,884
He read us all a letter
from the “Sheik”.

359
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:44,407
A letter?

360
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,019
What’d it say?

361
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:47,601
Cigarette?

362
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:01,383
It said, “Continue the jihad.”

363
00:28:02,537 --> 00:28:05,773
“The work will go on
for a hundred years.”

364
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,935
<i>You and I are gonna talk about some of
the guys at the training camps, yeah?</i>

365
00:28:14,949 --> 00:28:15,952
<i>Okay.</i>

366
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,465
<i>Some of these brothers
have done some bad things.</i>

367
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:24,141
<i>What I wanna do is, I wanna separate
them from the people like you.</i>

368
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,843
<i>Definitely, yeah.</i>

369
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,415
<i>All right, a guy called
Abu Ahmed, from Kuwait.</i>

370
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:33,037
<i>Yes, I remember him. The nice guy.</i>

371
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:36,311
<i>How close was he? What was his
relationship to the leadership?</i>

372
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,304
<i>I don’t know.</i>

373
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:38,214
<i>Did he eat with you guys?</i>

374
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:40,410
<i>Did he eat with the good guys,
or did he eat with the leadership?</i>

375
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:42,659
<i>I don’t know, sir.
I have no idea about it.</i>

376
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,966
<i>That’s something you
don’t need an idea about.</i>

377
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:53,016
<i>When you met Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,
was this one of the facilitators?</i>

378
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:56,559
<i>Is this Abu Ahmed?</i>

379
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:07,918
<i>— KSM, your boss.
— Mukhtar.</i>

380
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,452
<i>“Mukhtar”… “Potato”…</i>

381
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:13,342
<i>You say, “Po–tah–to”; I say, “Fucking
KSM”; you say, “Mukhtar”, okay?</i>

382
00:29:13,392 --> 00:29:16,732
<i>Now, after Mukhtar was captured,
what did Abu Ahmed do?</i>

383
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:21,603
<i>Abu Ahmed. I believe… I believe,
he went to work for the “Sheik”.</i>

384
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,174
<i>Is that him?</i>

385
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,406
<i>— Say it.
— Abu Ahmed.</i>

386
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,448
<i>— Say it again.
— Abu Ahmed.</i>

387
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,618
<i>Abu Ahmed!</i>

388
00:30:01,576 --> 00:30:02,869
<i>Abu Ahmed.</i>

389
00:30:03,532 --> 00:30:05,702
(French) Est-ce qu’il travaillait
directement pour Ben Laden?

390
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:08,255
On peut pas savoir qui travaille
directement pour Ben Laden.

391
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:11,473
Tout ce que je sais,
c’est qu’il fait partie du groupe.

392
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:15,387
Tu connais d’autres gens qui portaient
des messages pour Ben Laden?

393
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:22,743
Ben on va en parler
un p’tit peu alors. Hein.

394
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,108
Tu vas m’en parler?

395
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,658
How’s the needle in the haystack?

396
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,035
Fine.

397
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:47,414
Facilitators come and go.

398
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:50,888
One thing you can count on in
life is that everyone wants money.

399
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:55,076
You’re assuming that al-Qaeda members
are motivated by financial rewards.

400
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:56,436
They’re radicals.

401
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,629
Correct. You’re assuming that, uh,

402
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:04,242
greed won’t override ideology
in some of the weaker members.

403
00:31:04,348 --> 00:31:07,390
Money for walk-ins worked great in
the Cold War, I’ll give you that.

404
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:09,011
Thank you.

405
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:50,735
He says it looks like Abu Ahmed.

406
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,728
Who did he work for?

407
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:06,697
He was mostly with Abu Faraj.
They were always together.

408
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:08,801
What did he do for Faraj?

409
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:19,407
He carried messages from
Abu Faraj to bin Laden,

410
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:21,412
from bin Laden back to Abu Faraj.

411
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:24,125
We need to ask him something to
see if he’s telling the truth.

412
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:25,972
We don’t know if he really knew Faraj.

413
00:32:38,316 --> 00:32:41,665
He just told me the names of
all of Abu Faraj’s children.

414
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:43,940
I think he’s telling the truth.

415
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:49,525
Twenty detainees recognized
that photo of Abu Ahmed.

416
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:51,171
They say he’s part of
an inner circle of guys

417
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,442
that was hanging out
in Afghanistan pre-9/11.

418
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:56,555
A lot of them say that after
9/11, he went to work for KSM.

419
00:32:56,581 --> 00:32:59,088
When KSM was captured, he
went to work for Abu Faraj.

420
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:02,208
Primarily as a courier,
from Faraj to bin Laden.

421
00:33:02,362 --> 00:33:03,794
That’s good, but you still don’t have—

422
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,532
Yeah, but we don’t know if Abu’s
on the outside of the network.

423
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:06,909
A series of cut-outs and dead drops,

424
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:09,661
or if he has a direct
connection to bin Laden.

425
00:33:09,846 --> 00:33:11,790
I mean, does bin Laden invite
him into the living room,

426
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:14,588
and hand him a letter directly,
or is Abu just the last guy

427
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,876
in a long line of couriers, and
that’s why everybody knows him.

428
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:17,987
That’s not all you don’t know.

429
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:20,414
You don’t have his real name,
you don’t have a clue of where he is.

430
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,759
Yes, but we know that he’s important.

431
00:33:21,815 --> 00:33:23,749
The fact that everybody’s
heard of Abu Ahmed,

432
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:26,349
but nobody will tell me
where he is, suggests that.

433
00:33:26,745 --> 00:33:27,984
Maybe.

434
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,669
Detainees can withhold his
location for any number of reasons.

435
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,824
Perhaps they don’t know.

436
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:35,722
Perhaps this “Abu” is actually a cover
story and he’s really a fucking unicorn.

437
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,116
But the withholding doesn’t reveal
what you want it to, does it?

438
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:41,929
No.

439
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,355
And if you did find him, you don’t
know that he’d be with bin Laden.

440
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:46,806
We don’t know what we don’t know.

441
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:48,629
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

442
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:52,798
It’s tautology.

443
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:58,985
Listen, not one single detainee has said
that he’s been located with the big guy,

444
00:33:59,026 --> 00:34:01,259
just that he delivers messages,
am I wrong?

445
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,350
— No.
— No.

446
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:10,913
It’s still good work. Let me know when
you’ve got some actual intelligence.

447
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:13,005
Preferably, something
that leads to a strike.

448
00:34:52,785 --> 00:34:55,433
<i>This is what remains of the No. 10 bus,</i>

449
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,103
<i>which was travelling through
Tavistock Square, near Euston station.</i>

450
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:04,816
<i>There’d been explosions near Liverpool
Street and Edgware Road stations too.</i>

451
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:07,721
<i>Dozens of the survivors
were critically injured,</i>

452
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:11,107
<i>but many of the wounded were
also keen to share their stories.</i>

453
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,249
<i>We just pulled out of Edgware Road,</i>

454
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:19,173
<i>and next thing I know, is a
loud, um, large flash of light.</i>

455
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:23,435
<i>Uh, I felt a burning sensation on my
hands, put my hands up to my face…</i>

456
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:27,200
<i>Uh, I was on the floor by that point…</i>

457
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:32,737
<i>Yeah, I can’t recall anything prior
to that anymore. Any noise, any bang…</i>

458
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:37,157
<i>Normal life in one of the busiest parts
of the capital has now been suspended.</i>

459
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:41,058
<i>Just a few yards down the road here,
they continue to care for the injured.</i>

460
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:45,962
<i>And all around, groups of Londoners are
standing on corners, asking themselves,</i>

461
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:49,296
<i>“What has happened here, and who
could possibly have done this?”</i>

462
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,177
Come on.

463
00:36:05,524 --> 00:36:06,818
You too, come on.

464
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,385
You agency guys are twisted.

465
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,129
Detainee’s ready for you.

466
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:30,847
Come on. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

467
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:55,492
I want you to understand that I know you

468
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,912
I’ve been following you, and
studying you, for a long time.

469
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,517
I chased you in Lahore.

470
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,403
I had you picked up
instead of killing you,

471
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:05,477
because you’re not a violent
man, and you don’t deserve to die.

472
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:06,862
Thank you.

473
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:10,091
But you do have deep ties to
al-Qaeda I want to ask you about,

474
00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:13,734
before you get sent to your next
location, which might be Israel.

475
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:16,898
However, depending on how
candid you are here today,

476
00:37:17,822 --> 00:37:20,061
I may be able to keep you in Pakistan.

477
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,685
What do you want to know?

478
00:37:23,183 --> 00:37:26,692
I’m gonna ask you a series of questions,
based on your knowledge of al-Qaeda,

479
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:29,654
and your position as key
financier for the organization.

480
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,568
I have dealt with the horrors.

481
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:37,295
I have no wish to be tortured again.
Ask me a question, I will answer it.

482
00:37:37,914 --> 00:37:40,714
What can you tell me
about Atiyah Abdul-Rahman?

483
00:37:41,744 --> 00:37:46,626
He works for Zawahiri.
He’s in charge of military tactics.

484
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:50,874
In what context have you
ever heard the name Abu Ahmed?

485
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:59,412
He works for Faraj and bin Laden.
He is his most trusted courier.

486
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:03,357
What makes you say that?

487
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:06,137
He brought me many
messages from the “Sheik”.

488
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:14,293
Where did you last see
him, and where is he now?

489
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:19,301
— You will never find him.
— Why is that?

490
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:23,856
Even I couldn’t find him. He
always contacted me out of the blue.

491
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,847
He’s one of “the disappeared ones”.

492
00:41:02,317 --> 00:41:04,781
You’re in luck, I got you
a one–on–one with Faraj.

493
00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:06,929
Seriously? Thank you.

494
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,211
Don’t you thank me until
you hear what I want for it.

495
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:11,958
I want you to take care of all
this before your favorite subject.

496
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:12,997
Deal.

497
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:19,422
Don’t you wanna see whats in the folder?

498
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,811
You want family ties, financial networks
media sources, disgruntled employees,

499
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:27,339
imminent threats, homeland plots,
foreign sales, health status,

500
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,187
financial resources, tradecraft,
recruiting tactics, anything else?

501
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:33,637
— No, I think that covers it.
— Yeah.

502
00:41:35,853 --> 00:41:36,630
Huh?

503
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,021
“What they say is true. The Shaolin
and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous.”

504
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:45,845
What do you like to be called?
“Faraj”, “Fareej”, “Buzzie”?

505
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:48,609
C’mon, dude, what do you
like? You like a bit of, uh…

506
00:41:49,345 --> 00:41:51,419
You guys like a bit of Bob
Marley, with the Reggae?

507
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:54,801
Kick back, take it easy after
you’ve blown some shit up?

508
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:56,293
Huh?

509
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:58,421
No?

510
00:41:59,898 --> 00:42:01,434
Got some Libyan music you like?

511
00:42:09,435 --> 00:42:10,985
You did the UK bombings, right?

512
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,161
Well, you’re the second “Number 3”
I’ve captured. I got KSM.

513
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:26,111
Can I be honest with you?

514
00:42:28,357 --> 00:42:30,040
I’m bad fuckin’ news.

515
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,983
I’m not your friend.

516
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,748
Not gonna help you.

517
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:39,069
I’m gonna break you.

518
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:42,521
Any questions?

519
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:44,782
No?

520
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:49,069
All right, you haven’t eaten in 18
hours. We need to keep your energy up.

521
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:50,275
You hungry?

522
00:42:57,185 --> 00:42:58,612
A lot of brothers told us,

523
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:02,482
Abu Ahmed was Bin Laden’s courier, and
that he worked very closely with you.

524
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,534
You are thinking of Abu Khaled.

525
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:12,620
— Who?
— Al-Baluchi, my courier for the “Sheik”.

526
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:19,121
Okay, so you’re telling me, all
the other brothers are wrong.

527
00:43:19,234 --> 00:43:22,771
And there’s some famous “Baluchi”
guy, working for you and bin Laden,

528
00:43:22,806 --> 00:43:24,482
that I’ve never even heard of.

529
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:28,174
— Why should you have heard of him?
— What does this Baluchi guy look like?

530
00:43:29,213 --> 00:43:32,080
Tall. Long white beard.

531
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:36,077
Thin. He uses a cane.

532
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:38,388
Kinda like Gandalf.

533
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:39,937
Who?

534
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:43,167
When was the last time you saw him?

535
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:47,023
A month ago, in Karachi.

536
00:43:47,146 --> 00:43:52,622
But I don’t know where he is now.
Sometimes, I wouldn’t even see him.

537
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:57,520
He would just tell me,
where to leave the messages.

538
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,117
You’re not being fulsome in your replies

539
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,672
You cannot force me to tell
you something I don’t know.

540
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:10,974
You do realize this is not a normal
prison? You determine how you’re treated

541
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,341
And your life is gonna be
very uncomfortable, until…

542
00:44:13,382 --> 00:44:16,006
you give me the information I need!

543
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:21,757
Where exactly is Abu
Ahmed living at the moment?

544
00:44:33,576 --> 00:44:36,635
Faraj is completely
denying knowing Abu Ahmed.

545
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:41,201
That’s using every measure we have.

546
00:44:41,336 --> 00:44:42,718
Well, he’s either gonna keep withholding

547
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:45,058
or he’s gonna die from the
presssure you’re putting on him.

548
00:44:47,263 --> 00:44:48,898
Hey, you wanna take a run at him?

549
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:51,708
No.

550
00:44:52,669 --> 00:44:53,578
No?

551
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:56,052
— No.
— Since when? No.

552
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,793
You know, I was meaning to tell
you, I’m getting outta here.

553
00:45:01,936 --> 00:45:04,837
— You okay?
— Yeah, I’m fine, I’m just…

554
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:07,581
You know, I’ve seen too many guys naked.

555
00:45:09,401 --> 00:45:10,970
It’s gonna be over a fucking
hundred at this point.

556
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:13,135
I need to go and do
something normal for a while.

557
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:16,002
Like what?

558
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:20,214
I’ll go to Washington, do the dance,
see how that environment works.

559
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:22,855
You should come with me.

560
00:45:23,668 --> 00:45:26,436
Yeah, be my number two. You’re
looking a little strung out yourself.

561
00:45:28,902 --> 00:45:31,236
I’m not gonna find Abu Ahmed from DC.

562
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:40,242
They killed my monkeys.

563
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:44,935
Some bullshit about escaping,
you fucking believe that?

564
00:45:49,002 --> 00:45:50,536
Sorry, Dan.

565
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,604
Look, Maya, you gotta be real
careful with the detainees now.

566
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,899
Okay, politics are changing,
and you don’t wanna be

567
00:45:57,912 --> 00:46:01,211
the last one holding a dog collar,
when the Oversight Committee comes.

568
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:03,703
— I know.
— Yeah?

569
00:46:05,236 --> 00:46:09,369
And watch your back when you get back to
Pakistan. Everyone knows you there now.

570
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:05,270
Sorry. Fucking checkpoints.

571
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:08,338
— Maya?
— Yeah?

572
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:11,169
We’re socializing. Be social.

573
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:14,503
Okay.

574
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:22,870
Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby,
but it is time to cut the umbilical cord

575
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:26,172
— No, it’s not.
— So Faraj went south on you, it happens,

576
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,151
there are still cells
in London and Spain,

577
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,849
who are planning the
next round of attacks.

578
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:32,804
I could work on it at the same time.

579
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:35,663
Plus, I think it’s a good thing he lied.

580
00:47:35,671 --> 00:47:39,238
No, not at the expense of
protecting the homeland, you can’t…

581
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,905
Wait a minute. Why is it a good thing?

582
00:47:41,037 --> 00:47:43,638
You sound just like Bradley.
He doesn’t believe in my lead either.

583
00:47:48,274 --> 00:47:49,269
It’s a good thing,

584
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:53,470
because the fact that Faraj withheld
on Abu Ahmed is very revealing.

585
00:47:53,845 --> 00:47:57,686
The only other thing Faraj lied about,
was the location of bin Laden himself.

586
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:02,583
That means Faraj thinks Abu Ahmed’s just
as important to protect as bin Laden.

587
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:07,777
— That confirms my lead.
— Or it’s confirmation bias.

588
00:48:07,863 --> 00:48:09,072
Mmm…

589
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:14,739
We’re just worried about you,
okay? Is that okay to say?

590
00:48:15,302 --> 00:48:18,229
I mean, look how run-down you are.

591
00:48:25,626 --> 00:48:27,533
Where’s Jack?

592
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:30,061
Probably stuck in some
checkpoint, somewhere.

593
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:32,899
You two hooked up yet?

594
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:37,623
Hello, I work with him. I’m not that
girl that fucks. It’s unbecoming.

595
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,197
So, a little fooling
around wouldn’t hurt you.

596
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:43,756
Hmph…

597
00:48:45,303 --> 00:48:47,130
— So, no boyfriend?
— Mm–mm.

598
00:48:49,048 --> 00:48:50,919
You got any friends at all?

599
00:48:57,126 --> 00:48:57,984
That’s Jack.

600
00:48:59,259 --> 00:49:00,133
Hey.

601
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,448
That’s okay.

602
00:49:22,388 --> 00:49:23,091
Come on!

603
00:49:27,995 --> 00:49:28,848
Come on!

604
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:46,821
Go!

605
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:49,174
Come on, over here!

606
00:50:03,605 --> 00:50:08,738
<i>The blast left a crater, 10 meters or
30 feet wide, in front of the hotel.</i>

607
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:12,971
<i>Police tell CNN, the driver of the
truck bomb tried to talk his way pass</i>

608
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:16,624
<i>the hotel’s steel security
gate. When armed guards said no,</i>

609
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:20,980
<i>police said the driver detonated
more than 2,000 pounds of explosives.</i>

610
00:50:21,015 --> 00:50:25,094
<i>The Marriott, one of the most popular
destinations for locals and westerners</i>

611
00:50:25,129 --> 00:50:28,013
<i>in Islamabad, now destroyed.</i>

612
00:50:57,298 --> 00:50:58,820
The Jords have a mole.

613
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:00,163
What?

614
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:02,160
He made this video to
prove his bona fides.

615
00:51:03,172 --> 00:51:04,789
Shut up.

616
00:51:05,643 --> 00:51:09,318
Humam Khalil al-Balawi.
He’s a Jordanian doctor.

617
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:13,345
He’s right there in the inner circle.

618
00:51:15,378 --> 00:51:18,140
I don’t buy it. Didn’t you tell me
yourself, nobody turns on al-Qaeda?

619
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:20,785
The Jordans have worked him for a year,
dinners, money. They convinced him…

620
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:24,349
it’s his patriotic duty to turn
on al-Qaeda, and get rich doing it.

621
00:51:24,384 --> 00:51:26,956
— Yeah, well, so the Jords say.
— Yeah, you’re right.

622
00:51:27,397 --> 00:51:30,579
We can’t rely on this or the Jords.
We’ve gotta evaluate him face to face.

623
00:51:30,627 --> 00:51:32,563
He may not be that smart,
he may be full of shit.

624
00:51:32,652 --> 00:51:34,346
But we have to talk to him and find out.

625
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,313
The key is to meet him,

626
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:38,660
so we can figure out for
ourselves what he can actually do.

627
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,034
He really asked for a dialysis machine?

628
00:51:53,032 --> 00:51:55,026
Maybe we can fill the
damn thing with poison.

629
00:52:02,822 --> 00:52:06,258
The meeting with Balawi is
off. He can’t come to Islamabad.

630
00:52:06,466 --> 00:52:11,194
— Can’t or won’t?
— He’s not gonna travel. Security risk.

631
00:52:12,764 --> 00:52:15,873
<i>…and, uh, I’ve said repeatedly,
that America doesn’t torture.</i>

632
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:20,184
<i>And I’m gonna make sure that we don’t
torture. Those are part and parcel of…</i>

633
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:26,473
<i>an—an effort to regain, uh,
America’s moral stature in the world.</i>

634
00:52:26,573 --> 00:52:28,162
<i>Can you give us some sense
of when you might start…</i>

635
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:31,422
He… wants us to go to him.

636
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:35,765
He’ll meet us in Maidan
Shar with the Tribals.

637
00:52:36,243 --> 00:52:38,252
He knows you’re white,
we’d get kidnapped there.

638
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:43,405
Could we do it somewhere else? Germany?
In the UK? He’s got a clean passport.

639
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,371
He’s not gonna travel
out of al-Qaeda territory.

640
00:52:46,474 --> 00:52:49,105
— And you’re not going to him.
— I’m not, believe me.

641
00:52:50,431 --> 00:52:51,562
We’re stuck.

642
00:52:55,442 --> 00:53:00,982
What about Camp Chapman…
Afghanistan? That can be safe territory.

643
00:53:10,702 --> 00:53:13,975
This may be going overboard,
but I baked him a cake.

644
00:53:15,105 --> 00:53:17,373
<i>Muslims don’t celebrate with cake.</i>

645
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:20,127
Don’t be so literal, everyone likes cake

646
00:53:20,273 --> 00:53:22,940
<i>It’s not too late for you to
come, you know, it’ll be fun.</i>

647
00:53:23,006 --> 00:53:25,273
No, I don’t want to be a straphanger.

648
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,048
It’s your show. You were the
first to see the potential in this.

649
00:53:28,146 --> 00:53:31,572
<i>Oh, come on, we’ve got lots of wine.</i>

650
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:33,641
Cool, bring me back a bottle.

651
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:36,208
<i>That, I will do.</i>

652
00:53:37,892 --> 00:53:39,079
Not to get technical,

653
00:53:40,195 --> 00:53:43,776
but this guy is actually the first
big break we’ve had since 9/11.

654
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,007
To big breaks, and the little
people that make ‘em happen.

655
00:53:51,518 --> 00:53:55,319
So far, everything he’s said, we’ve
cross-checked, and it’s proved legit.

656
00:53:55,882 --> 00:53:59,084
And I think the money is persuasive.

657
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:03,030
25 million dollars?

658
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:06,190
That buys a new life.

659
00:54:07,632 --> 00:54:09,882
Do you think he might be
exaggerating his access?

660
00:54:10,657 --> 00:54:11,753
Possibly.

661
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:16,623
But, al-Qaeda needs doctors, and
they are short-staffed, and…

662
00:54:17,293 --> 00:54:19,084
that could explain his rise.

663
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:21,876
In six months to a year,

664
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:26,767
if he doesn’t fuck up, he could
be called in to treat bin Laden.

665
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,247
At that moment, with 25 mill on the
table, I think he gives up the big man.

666
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:36,392
And if he doesn’t, we kill him.

667
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:51,344
— John.
— Yeah.

668
00:54:51,749 --> 00:54:54,175
When he arrives, let me set the
tone, and then I’ll flip it to you,

669
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,841
and you can talk about asset protection.

670
00:54:57,007 --> 00:54:58,608
— Roger that.
— Uh, Lauren,

671
00:54:59,919 --> 00:55:04,561
I know you wanna get some questions in
there, but give Balawi a little time.

672
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:08,532
After John speaks, we’ll cover
the basics, have his birthday cake,

673
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:10,357
then we’ll get into the nitty–gritty.

674
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,257
Is that order okay? Or d—do
you wanna introduce everyone?

675
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:17,153
I’ll introduce you,
you introduce your team.

676
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,795
— He knows this is a high-level meeting.
— Quick question.

677
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:23,163
All this taking place
inside our main building?

678
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:26,377
Right, and, uh, Lauren,
Washington will want

679
00:55:26,419 --> 00:55:29,140
real-time updates, so
please, stay on top of that.

680
00:55:29,508 --> 00:55:31,431
Be concise, the director’s in the loop…

681
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,290
and I wouldn’t be surprised…

682
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:37,775
if he doesn’t update the president.

683
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:39,523
Yeah, I’m on it.

684
00:55:40,474 --> 00:55:42,852
Now, I just gotta get his ass down here.

685
00:57:28,499 --> 00:57:30,144
Why are there gate guards there?

686
00:57:30,168 --> 00:57:32,794
We talked about this, no one is supposed
to be there when my source arrives.

687
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,558
You might have spooked him already.

688
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:37,144
Well, procedures only work
if we follow them every time.

689
00:57:37,176 --> 00:57:41,198
This is different. I’m sorry, I can’t
explain, but it’s for a good cause.

690
00:57:41,995 --> 00:57:45,664
Look, I’m responsible for everybody’s
safety, okay. It’s not just about you.

691
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:47,407
I just need them to go away for a minute.

692
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:49,144
You can search him as
soon as he gets here.

693
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,545
All stations, this is Whiplash.

694
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:58,039
<i>Go ahead and stand down.</i>

695
00:57:58,977 --> 00:57:59,911
Copy that.

696
00:58:22,677 --> 00:58:23,755
Thank you.

697
00:59:07,862 --> 00:59:08,877
Okay, he’s coming.

698
00:59:11,626 --> 00:59:14,131
— We gonna search him when he gets here
— Sure.

699
00:59:51,911 --> 00:59:53,160
Okay, let’s go.

700
01:00:10,466 --> 01:00:13,750
— Is he supposed to limp like that?
— Get your hand out of your pocket.

701
01:00:14,974 --> 01:00:17,163
— Hey.
— “Allah hu Akbar.” (God is Great)

702
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:18,910
— Hey!
— Get your hand out of your pocket

703
01:00:18,945 --> 01:00:20,885
— Do it now!
— “Allah hu Akbar.”

704
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,616
— Get your hand out of your poc…
— “Allah hu Akb—”

705
01:00:42,077 --> 01:00:44,645
<i>The CIA says, seven of
it’s employees were killed,</i>

706
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,831
<i>and six others wounded, in a suicide
bombing in a base in Afghanistan.</i>

707
01:00:48,866 --> 01:00:51,846
<i>It was one of the deadliest
attacks in CIA history.</i>

708
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:53,308
<i>The Associated Press has learned that…</i>

709
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:56,773
<i>the chief of the CIA’s post in
the province, is among the victims.</i>

710
01:00:56,808 --> 01:00:59,575
<i>Former officials say, she
was the mother of three.</i>

711
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,156
<i>The Taliban claimed
resposibility for the bombing…</i>

712
01:01:52,697 --> 01:01:54,674
— You okay?
— Mhm.

713
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:59,877
I, um, didn’t think this
day could get any worse…

714
01:02:01,188 --> 01:02:02,432
But, uh…

715
01:02:03,228 --> 01:02:06,639
bad news from Saudi
intelligence. The, um…

716
01:02:07,179 --> 01:02:10,324
courier guy, Abu Ahmed, is dead.

717
01:02:11,412 --> 01:02:13,180
It’s a detainee video.

718
01:02:36,913 --> 01:02:37,776
<i>He’s dead.</i>

719
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:43,159
<i>In Afghanistan, 2001, I
buried him with my own hands.</i>

720
01:02:45,213 --> 01:02:48,680
<i>He’s dead. In Afghanistan, 2001…</i>

721
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:50,641
<i>And where was this?</i>

722
01:02:51,978 --> 01:02:52,804
<i>Kabul.</i>

723
01:02:52,957 --> 01:02:55,690
No, I don’t believe this.
I don’t believe this.

724
01:02:57,248 --> 01:02:58,296
Sorry, Maya.

725
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:01,179
I always liked this lead.

726
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:27,845
Sorry I just got here.

727
01:03:38,546 --> 01:03:39,551
What are you going to do?

728
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:50,265
I’m gonna smoke everybody
involved in this op.

729
01:03:51,959 --> 01:03:53,814
And then I’m gonna kill bin Laden.

730
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:04,690
Right.

731
01:04:07,305 --> 01:04:08,031
Right.

732
01:04:31,288 --> 01:04:33,340
I wanna make something absolutely clear.

733
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,486
If you thought there was some…

734
01:04:37,434 --> 01:04:40,635
secret cell somewhere, working al-Qaeda,

735
01:04:41,682 --> 01:04:43,425
well, I want you to
know that you’re wrong.

736
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:46,550
This is it.

737
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,946
There’s no working group
coming to the rescue.

738
01:04:52,787 --> 01:04:55,775
There’s nobody else hidden
away on some other floor.

739
01:04:56,881 --> 01:04:58,064
There is just us.

740
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:01,725
And we are failing!

741
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:07,249
We’re spending billions of dollars.

742
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:09,384
People are dying!

743
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:13,922
We are still no closer
to defeating our enemy.

744
01:05:16,383 --> 01:05:17,912
They attacked us!

745
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:21,030
On land, in ‘98,

746
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,757
by sea in 2000, and from the air in 2001

747
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:32,522
They murdered 3,000 of our
citizens, in cold blood.

748
01:05:34,248 --> 01:05:36,743
And they have slaughtered
our forward–deployed!

749
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:39,852
And what the fuck have
we done about it, huh?

750
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:43,673
What have we done?

751
01:05:46,153 --> 01:05:50,622
We have twenty leadership names.
We’ve only eliminated four of them.

752
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:54,705
I want…

753
01:05:55,597 --> 01:05:56,448
targets.

754
01:05:57,647 --> 01:06:00,934
Do your fuckin’ jobs,
bring me people to kill.

755
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,649
Hi, I painstakingly combed through
everything in the system and found this.

756
01:06:32,903 --> 01:06:33,658
It’s him.

757
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:38,521
He was one of ten names on a watch list
sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11.

758
01:06:38,906 --> 01:06:40,274
Ibrahim Sayeed.

759
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:42,621
They told us to watch
out for him. Apparently,

760
01:06:42,656 --> 01:06:46,897
they think his whole family and extended
family is bad, and has ties to KSM.

761
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:51,196
He was picked up for fake papers and a
doctored exit visa leaving Afghanistan,

762
01:06:51,272 --> 01:06:55,929
traveling through Morocco, en route
to Kuwait. Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

763
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,354
This must be Abu Ahmed.

764
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:07,318
Doesn’t matter. God, I wish
I had that five years ago.

765
01:07:08,836 --> 01:07:11,974
— How come I never saw it before?
— Nobody saw it, most likely.

766
01:07:12,691 --> 01:07:14,761
There was a lot of
white noise after 9/11.

767
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:18,255
Countries wanting to help out.
We got a million tips, and…

768
01:07:19,067 --> 01:07:21,479
you know, things got lost in the shuffle.

769
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,044
Human error.

770
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:27,968
Anyway, I thought you
should know about it.

771
01:07:35,327 --> 01:07:38,110
I just wanna say, I’ve
heard a lot about you.

772
01:07:38,818 --> 01:07:40,663
You’ve inspired me to come to Pakistan.

773
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:44,117
Maybe you’d let me buy
you a kebab sometime.

774
01:07:44,457 --> 01:07:45,567
Don’t eat out.

775
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:48,574
It’s too dangerous.

776
01:08:06,192 --> 01:08:09,444
— Yup.
— Dan, Debbie found Abu Ahmed.

777
01:08:11,058 --> 01:08:12,127
Really?

778
01:08:12,306 --> 01:08:13,766
<i>Yeah, he’s been in the files this</i>

779
01:08:13,783 --> 01:08:16,037
whole time. The family’s name is Sayeed.

780
01:08:16,421 --> 01:08:17,713
Okay, but he’s, uh,

781
01:08:17,728 --> 01:08:20,700
he’s dead, so doesn’t that make him
a little less interesting to you?

782
01:08:20,735 --> 01:08:24,492
<i>He may not be. We now know Abu
Ahmed is one of eight brothers.</i>

783
01:08:24,523 --> 01:08:27,920
All the brothers in the family look
alike. Three of them went to Afghanistan

784
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,332
<i>Isn’t it possible that when</i>

785
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:33,404
<i>the three eldest brothers grew beards in
Afghanistan, they started to look alike?</i>

786
01:08:33,451 --> 01:08:36,494
I think the one calling himself
Abu Ahmed is still alive.

787
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,226
The picture we’ve been using is wrong.

788
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:43,742
It’s of his older brother,
Habib. He’s the one that’s dead.

789
01:08:43,863 --> 01:08:45,451
Okay, and what are you basing this on?

790
01:08:45,472 --> 01:08:48,245
<i>We have no intercepts
about Abu Ahmed dying.</i>

791
01:08:48,552 --> 01:08:52,183
We just have a detainee, who said he
buried a guy, who looked like Abu Ahmed.

792
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:54,765
But if someone as important
as Abu Ahmed had died,

793
01:08:54,802 --> 01:08:56,170
they’d be talking about it online,

794
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:57,830
<i>in chatrooms all over the place.</i>

795
01:08:58,022 --> 01:09:01,410
<i>Plus, the detainee said
that Habib died in 2001.</i>

796
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:05,336
We know Abu Ahmed was alive then,
trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar.

797
01:09:05,431 --> 01:09:08,341
That means it’s probably
one of the other brothers

798
01:09:08,386 --> 01:09:09,616
<i>that’s dead.</i>

799
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:16,158
— In other words, you want it to be true
— Yes, I fucking want it to be true!

800
01:09:16,177 --> 01:09:18,115
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down.</i>

801
01:09:18,245 --> 01:09:20,524
— Calm down.
— I am calm.

802
01:09:22,102 --> 01:09:23,275
State your request.

803
01:09:25,234 --> 01:09:26,468
Move heaven and earth…

804
01:09:27,713 --> 01:09:31,146
and bring me this fucking
Sayeed family’s phone number.

805
01:09:35,328 --> 01:09:37,106
<i>Okay, I’ll go and talk to the Wolf.</i>

806
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,793
— As-salam alaykum. (Peace be unto you)
— Wa-alaykum salam. (And unto you peace)

807
01:10:08,151 --> 01:10:10,179
I need a couple of
hundred thousand bucks.

808
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:12,946
Four max.

809
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:18,892
— Where’re you gonna get that?
— From you.

810
01:10:19,182 --> 01:10:20,757
— You think so?
— Yeah.

811
01:10:20,962 --> 01:10:21,885
This could crack open

812
01:10:21,892 --> 01:10:24,791
the facilitator Maya’s been looking
for, by giving us a phone number.

813
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:28,569
She’s your killer, Wolf,
you put her on the field.

814
01:10:30,213 --> 01:10:30,914
Come on,

815
01:10:30,922 --> 01:10:33,329
“Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem” (In the
name of God, most Gracious, most Merciful)

816
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:38,125
Allah rewards those that strive and
fight, over those that sit behind a desk.

817
01:10:42,269 --> 01:10:46,430
As you know, Abu Ghraib
and Gitmo fucked us.

818
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:51,562
The Detainee Program is now flypaper.
We got Senators jumping out of our asses.

819
01:10:52,157 --> 01:10:54,352
And the director is very concerned.

820
01:10:55,579 --> 01:10:58,219
They will not stop
until they have a body.

821
01:11:00,914 --> 01:11:01,897
I ran it.

822
01:11:04,034 --> 01:11:05,079
I’ll defend it.

823
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,317
Done.

824
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,583
I tell you what, man, it’s
good to be back in Kuwait.

825
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:38,665
It’s good to see you again.
Huh? It’s been a while.

826
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,630
I need a favor.

827
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:49,653
Why I should help you?

828
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:51,482
Because we’re friends.

829
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,485
You’re saying we are friend.

830
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:56,508
How come you only call
me when you need help?

831
01:11:57,031 --> 01:12:00,220
But when I need something, you
are too busy to pick up the phone.

832
01:12:00,887 --> 01:12:04,102
— I don’t think we are friends.
— All right, fair enough.

833
01:12:06,116 --> 01:12:09,368
How about a V10 Lamborghini?
How’s that for friendship?

834
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:12,636
Poor fucker had to get out of bed.

835
01:12:16,724 --> 01:12:17,448
Hey.

836
01:12:21,351 --> 01:12:22,848
— As-salam alaykum.
— Wa-alaykum salam.

837
01:12:22,883 --> 01:12:24,003
— Thank you very much for this.
— You’re welcome.

838
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:24,857
Appreciate it.

839
01:12:27,692 --> 01:12:28,633
All right.

840
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,140
— Ooh, is this a Balboni?
— Yeah.

841
01:12:34,612 --> 01:12:35,605
Fuck me dead.

842
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,539
It’s nice, really nice.
What are you thinking?

843
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,651
Huh? Maybe a convertible?
Get a little wind in the hair?

844
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:46,225
Huh? Put the top down?

845
01:12:49,704 --> 01:12:51,437
I think I will choose this one.

846
01:12:52,215 --> 01:12:53,957
Give us a minute? Thank you.

847
01:12:55,062 --> 01:12:58,736
That’s a nice choice, my friend.
Speed yellow, go big or go home, huh?

848
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:00,621
Nice choice.

849
01:13:07,795 --> 01:13:08,640
Sayeed.

850
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,601
— Who is it?
— Who do you think?

851
01:13:13,538 --> 01:13:14,607
Guy’s a terrorist.

852
01:13:15,286 --> 01:13:16,429
His mother lives here.

853
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:19,493
I just need her phone number.

854
01:13:21,452 --> 01:13:23,869
There will be no repercussions in Kuwait?

855
01:13:25,846 --> 01:13:28,212
I mean, somebody might die,
at some point, in Pakistan.

856
01:13:31,664 --> 01:13:32,757
We got a deal?

857
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,378
Hey, Jack.

858
01:14:19,782 --> 01:14:22,357
Sayeed family call in progress,
but you’re not gonna like this.

859
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,580
<i>The ground branch guys
are dragging their heels,</i>

860
01:14:24,615 --> 01:14:26,385
<i>there’s no team deployed right now.</i>

861
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,123
Fuck.

862
01:14:27,144 --> 01:14:28,594
<i>He hasn’t said anything incriminating,</i>

863
01:14:28,609 --> 01:14:30,880
<i>but he’s at the Rawal
call center in Rawalpindi.</i>

864
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:33,716
Hey!

865
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:37,390
Why haven’t you deployed a
team to stay in Rawalpindi?

866
01:14:40,251 --> 01:14:41,638
For one thing, it’s dangerous.

867
01:14:43,126 --> 01:14:45,852
For another, the area is too
congested for us to be effective,

868
01:14:45,946 --> 01:14:48,479
without some predictive intelligence.
— Yeah, but that’s why

869
01:14:48,494 --> 01:14:51,004
you should forward deploy, so
you can shorten the response time.

870
01:14:51,011 --> 01:14:52,780
— It still wouldn’t work.
— Why?

871
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,843
The guy never stays on
the phone long enough.

872
01:14:57,912 --> 01:15:01,060
— You haven’t tried.
— Look, I don’t have the personnel.

873
01:15:01,095 --> 01:15:02,830
— That’s bullshit, man.
— Yeah?

874
01:15:03,102 --> 01:15:06,513
As it is, my guys don’t get any sleep,
tracking the threats within Pakistan.

875
01:15:07,186 --> 01:15:08,187
Right, I understand.

876
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:11,087
But, you know, I don’t really
care if your guys get sleep or not.

877
01:15:33,207 --> 01:15:34,845
This guy you are obsessed with.

878
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:36,930
What’s his name again?

879
01:15:37,214 --> 01:15:39,659
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti
is the nom de guerre.

880
01:15:40,593 --> 01:15:42,814
His true name, we
think, is Ibrahim Sayeed.

881
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,547
Family lives in Kuwait. We’ve
been listening in on their calls.

882
01:15:47,358 --> 01:15:48,062
Wasn’t it…

883
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:53,567
like, eight brothers and a
million cousins that we know about?

884
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,775
— Anyone could be calling home.
— I know.

885
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:59,566
I mean, it’s not like he’s saying,
“Hey, Mom, it’s me, the terrorist.”

886
01:16:00,887 --> 01:16:05,072
Yeah, I know. But, look,
over the course of two months,

887
01:16:05,576 --> 01:16:07,312
He’s called from six different payphones

888
01:16:07,347 --> 01:16:10,587
from two different cities,
never using the same phone twice.

889
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:13,154
And when his mother asked
him where he was, he lied.

890
01:16:13,317 --> 01:16:16,204
He said that he was in a place in
the country with bad cell reception,

891
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:20,229
implying he was in the Tribals. When,
in fact, he was in a market in Peshawar.

892
01:16:20,463 --> 01:16:23,245
I’m sorry but that’s not normal
guy behavior, that’s tradecraft.

893
01:16:25,383 --> 01:16:28,134
Or maybe he just doesn’t like his Mum.

894
01:16:32,663 --> 01:16:35,539
Look, if he talks about an operation or…

895
01:16:36,207 --> 01:16:39,343
refers to anything remotely
fishy, I’ll get on him.

896
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,506
— Okay?
— No, no, not okay, look.

897
01:16:42,216 --> 01:16:46,603
Abu Ahmed is too smart to tip his
hand, by talking about ops on the phone.

898
01:16:47,237 --> 01:16:48,849
He works for bin Laden.

899
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:52,247
The guys that talk about ops
on the phone don’t get that job.

900
01:16:56,967 --> 01:16:59,521
A lot of my friends have
died, trying to do this.

901
01:17:03,859 --> 01:17:06,580
I believe I was spared,
so I could finish the job.

902
01:18:09,804 --> 01:18:14,722
<i>It is in surveillance video and pictures
like this of the explosive-laden vehicle</i>

903
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:18,535
<i>just moments before it was parked,
that police hope to find the man,</i>

904
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:23,204
<i>who wanted so badly last night,
to leave a body count in Times Square.</i>

905
01:18:23,239 --> 01:18:27,005
<i>There are some people around the world,
that find our freedom so threatening,</i>

906
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,567
<i>that they’re willing to
kill themselves and others,</i>

907
01:18:29,602 --> 01:18:32,164
<i>to prevent us from enjoying it, but
we’re not gonna let that happen…</i>

908
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:33,410
Hey, I really need to talk to you

909
01:18:33,445 --> 01:18:35,508
about beefing up our surveillance
operation on the caller.

910
01:18:35,534 --> 01:18:38,326
We don’t have a surveillance
operation on the caller.

911
01:18:38,943 --> 01:18:41,866
Someone just tried to blow up Times
Square and you’re talking to me about

912
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:44,559
some facilitator, who some
detainee, seven years ago, said,

913
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:47,677
— might have been working with al-Qaeda?
— He’s the key to bin Laden.

914
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:54,037
I don’t fucking care about bin
Laden, I care about the next attack.

915
01:18:54,775 --> 01:18:57,620
You’re gonna start working on
the American al-Qaeda cells.

916
01:18:57,655 --> 01:18:58,656
Protect the homeland.

917
01:18:58,672 --> 01:19:01,867
Bin Laden is the one who keeps
telling them to attack the homeland.

918
01:19:02,688 --> 01:19:06,381
If it wasn’t for him, al-Qaeda would
still be focused on overseas targets.

919
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:10,374
If you really wanna protect the
homeland, you need to get bin Laden.

920
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:12,315
This guy never met bin Laden!

921
01:19:13,339 --> 01:19:16,116
This guy’s a freelancer working
off the fucking internet.

922
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:19,991
No one’s even talked to bin Laden
in four years. He’s out of the game.

923
01:19:20,026 --> 01:19:22,628
He may well even be dead. He
might as well be fucking dead.

924
01:19:22,663 --> 01:19:24,085
But you know what you’re doing?

925
01:19:24,296 --> 01:19:27,578
You’re chasing a ghost while the whole
fucking network grows all around you.

926
01:19:27,599 --> 01:19:30,311
You just want me to nail some
low-level molar–cracker–doler,

927
01:19:30,346 --> 01:19:32,327
so you can check that box
on your resume that says,

928
01:19:32,362 --> 01:19:35,422
while you were in Pakistan,
you got a real terrorist.

929
01:19:35,457 --> 01:19:40,703
But the truth is, you don’t understand
Pakistan, and you don’t know al-Qaeda!

930
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,940
Either give me the team
I need, to follow this lead,

931
01:19:43,975 --> 01:19:45,737
or that other thing you’re
gonna have on your resume,

932
01:19:45,772 --> 01:19:49,221
is being the first station chief to be
called before Congressional Committee,

933
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:53,596
for subverting the efforts
to capture or kill bin Laden!

934
01:19:57,699 --> 01:19:59,578
You’re fucking out of your mind.

935
01:20:01,823 --> 01:20:04,585
I need four techs and a
safe house in Rawalpindi…

936
01:20:05,339 --> 01:20:07,157
Four techs and a safe house in Peshawar.

937
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,049
Either send them out,

938
01:20:09,098 --> 01:20:12,652
or send me back to DC, and explain
to the director why you didn’t.

939
01:20:32,568 --> 01:20:33,731
I’ve been looking for you.

940
01:20:34,152 --> 01:20:35,119
But more importantly,

941
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:36,906
he’s been looking for you.

942
01:20:38,129 --> 01:20:40,349
Yesterday, your caller
bought himself a cell phone.

943
01:20:41,656 --> 01:20:43,571
And every time his phone rings,

944
01:20:44,252 --> 01:20:45,753
this phone will ring.

945
01:20:48,235 --> 01:20:49,997
Did I hook you up? Did I?

946
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,546
My guess is that he lives close
to where he’s making the calls.

947
01:21:05,559 --> 01:21:08,123
And it makes sense he’d
be living in Rawalpindi,

948
01:21:08,482 --> 01:21:10,571
because there’s an Al
Jazeera office there.

949
01:21:11,428 --> 01:21:13,443
It’d be convenient for
him to drop the tapes off,

950
01:21:13,479 --> 01:21:17,440
if he’s messengering, either from
Bin Laden, or to an intermediary.

951
01:21:17,712 --> 01:21:19,780
So, when he wants to make a call,

952
01:21:20,037 --> 01:21:23,808
he leaves the house, walks a few
blocks, then switches on the phone.

953
01:21:24,306 --> 01:21:26,749
We need to keep canvassing the
neighborhood until we find him.

954
01:21:42,515 --> 01:21:43,512
We got a shooter.

955
01:21:50,049 --> 01:21:50,975
We’re blocked.

956
01:21:57,035 --> 01:21:58,073
Let me talk to them.

957
01:22:34,687 --> 01:22:36,558
They said whites faces don’t belong here.

958
01:22:38,155 --> 01:22:39,898
If they don’t move, shoot them.

959
01:23:10,504 --> 01:23:11,438
He’s still on?

960
01:23:13,548 --> 01:23:15,840
— He’s east of us, try the market.
— Okay, heading east.

961
01:23:26,872 --> 01:23:27,631
Fuck.

962
01:24:03,507 --> 01:24:07,034
We got a signal on Tipu
Road for ten minutes.

963
01:24:07,818 --> 01:24:10,398
Then he went to Umar Road for 5 minutes,

964
01:24:10,415 --> 01:24:15,031
NoGaza Road, Darya Abad,
that’s in the Umar Road area.

965
01:24:15,364 --> 01:24:16,556
In Rawalpindi,

966
01:24:17,312 --> 01:24:18,372
Haider Road.

967
01:24:18,766 --> 01:24:20,135
Roomi Road.

968
01:24:21,081 --> 01:24:23,876
He went to the Convoy Road, which
is near the hospital, all right?

969
01:24:24,383 --> 01:24:30,355
So that’s Haider, Roomi
Road, Zahid, NoGaza, Taimur.

970
01:24:31,016 --> 01:24:34,568
He made a call from Hapur
Street. That’s the Spice District.

971
01:24:35,092 --> 01:24:38,061
Lahore Street, which is also in Pesh
— 30 minutes.

972
01:24:38,785 --> 01:24:41,274
Wazir Bagh Road — 5.

973
01:24:42,111 --> 01:24:44,463
Nishtarabad — 5.

974
01:24:46,933 --> 01:24:49,152
Phandu Road — 5 minutes.

975
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:55,970
The Grand Trunk Road — 45 seconds.

976
01:24:56,943 --> 01:24:58,186
There’s no pattern.

977
01:24:58,931 --> 01:25:01,171
Sometimes, he calls every two
weeks, sometimes, every three.

978
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,326
There’s no consistency.

979
01:25:02,533 --> 01:25:05,543
I can’t predict when he’s gonna make
another call, ‘cause the guy’s erratic.

980
01:26:08,268 --> 01:26:11,710
<i>Meanwhile, our chief foreign
correspondent, Richard Engel confirms</i>

981
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:16,172
<i>the CIA’s top spy in Pakistan
has been pulled out of there.</i>

982
01:26:16,217 --> 01:26:20,012
<i>He’s been receiving death threats,
after being named publicly in a lawsuit,</i>

983
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:23,868
<i>by the family of a victim
of a US drone attack.</i>

984
01:26:23,903 --> 01:26:27,011
<i>Richard Engel quotes a senior
intelligence official as saying,</i>

985
01:26:27,046 --> 01:26:31,013
<i>the officer is returning to the US,
after the decision was made that</i>

986
01:26:31,048 --> 01:26:35,530
<i>terrorist threats against him, in
Pakistan, were of such a serious nature,</i>

987
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:38,094
<i>it would not be smart not to act.</i>

988
01:26:40,894 --> 01:26:42,495
ISI fucked you.

989
01:26:46,694 --> 01:26:48,395
I’m so sorry, Joseph.

990
01:27:18,881 --> 01:27:19,927
Still on tower three.

991
01:27:20,795 --> 01:27:21,544
5…

992
01:27:22,464 --> 01:27:24,334
Signal getting stronger, 10…

993
01:27:25,057 --> 01:27:26,287
15… Keep going.

994
01:27:26,683 --> 01:27:29,313
20… 15… 10…

995
01:27:29,918 --> 01:27:31,262
Signal’s getting weaker.

996
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:38,198
We lost him, no signal.

997
01:27:40,784 --> 01:27:42,048
Heading south.

998
01:27:50,507 --> 01:27:51,613
He’s up at 5 again.

999
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:53,615
15… 20…

1000
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:56,654
He’s moving fast, he’s in a vehicle.

1001
01:27:57,301 --> 01:27:59,724
Weaker now, he shifted. Go back to 5.

1002
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:03,085
He’s close by here, somewhere.

1003
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:05,050
I don’t get it.

1004
01:28:07,475 --> 01:28:09,104
He’s driving in circles.

1005
01:28:19,905 --> 01:28:21,119
— No change?
— No.

1006
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:32,966
Now let’s hope he comes back around.

1007
01:29:05,035 --> 01:29:06,480
Okay, 15…

1008
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:08,723
20…

1009
01:29:09,467 --> 01:29:10,189
30…

1010
01:29:11,469 --> 01:29:12,226
40…

1011
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,883
50…

1012
01:29:14,945 --> 01:29:16,169
We’re within ten meters of it.

1013
01:29:24,199 --> 01:29:25,053
Back to 40.

1014
01:29:26,769 --> 01:29:28,434
— He’s here somewhere.
— Look at the cars.

1015
01:29:28,845 --> 01:29:30,321
Look at the cars, he’s in a vehicle.

1016
01:29:36,944 --> 01:29:38,554
The guy with the phone in the white car.

1017
01:29:39,732 --> 01:29:40,583
You see him?

1018
01:29:42,415 --> 01:29:44,047
— Is that him?
— Could be.

1019
01:29:44,725 --> 01:29:45,946
— You got him?
— Got him.

1020
01:29:46,196 --> 01:29:47,145
Okay, breaking off.

1021
01:29:50,624 --> 01:29:52,142
The guy you’ve been looking for,

1022
01:29:52,272 --> 01:29:53,443
geolocated,

1023
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:54,728
on his cell phone,

1024
01:29:55,262 --> 01:29:56,084
in his white car.

1025
01:29:57,961 --> 01:29:58,854
Thank you.

1026
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:02,472
If you’re right,

1027
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,755
the whole world’s gonna want in on this.

1028
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,458
So, you gotta stick to your guns now.

1029
01:30:17,155 --> 01:30:21,093
Okay. No, it’s great to speak to you too
I’m—I’m amazed that you’re still here.

1030
01:30:22,744 --> 01:30:24,227
Well, I—I can do, um…

1031
01:30:24,895 --> 01:30:26,205
Let me have a look, um…

1032
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:27,999
Why don’t we say 1:30.

1033
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:31,917
Yeah.

1034
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:34,936
Uh, can you just hold the line, please?

1035
01:30:35,934 --> 01:30:38,773
I need a picket line along the GT
Highway, and men spaced at intervals

1036
01:30:38,797 --> 01:30:41,760
— along the road, and at every exit.
— Maya, I know.

1037
01:30:41,963 --> 01:30:44,297
So, you agree with me
now, this is important.

1038
01:30:45,895 --> 01:30:48,968
No, I’ve just learned from my
predecessor, that life is better

1039
01:30:48,996 --> 01:30:50,609
when I don’t disagree with you.

1040
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:38,319
Our current hypothesis is that he
lives somewhere along the highway,

1041
01:31:38,543 --> 01:31:41,479
in one of the towns, or a
medium-sized city called Abbottabad,

1042
01:31:41,536 --> 01:31:42,964
or up near Kashmir.

1043
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:48,022
Kashmir is interesting because
it’s a way station for the Tribals.

1044
01:31:49,596 --> 01:31:52,628
Abbottabad is interesting because we
know from detainee reporting that

1045
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:55,464
Abu Faraj stayed there, briefly, in 2003

1046
01:31:58,109 --> 01:32:00,461
The good news is he’s
driving a white SUV.

1047
01:32:00,937 --> 01:32:03,231
SUVs are actually
pretty rare in Pakistan.

1048
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:06,818
If he was driving a sedan
or a compact, we’d be fucked.

1049
01:32:07,864 --> 01:32:10,259
Obviously, this assumes
he doesn’t change vehicles.

1050
01:32:23,909 --> 01:32:25,784
— Morning.
— Morning, Hamad.

1051
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:23,431
“Yalla, yalla…”

1052
01:33:30,929 --> 01:33:35,762
Any American in Pakistan is a target.
They don’t necessarily know I’m CIA.

1053
01:33:36,088 --> 01:33:36,934
Doesn’t matter.

1054
01:33:37,814 --> 01:33:38,869
You’re on a list.

1055
01:33:39,821 --> 01:33:40,521
Yeah.

1056
01:33:40,899 --> 01:33:43,946
And you, of all people, should
know that once you’re on their list…

1057
01:33:45,484 --> 01:33:46,700
you never get off.

1058
01:33:47,911 --> 01:33:50,710
Next time, there may not be
bulletproof glass to save you.

1059
01:33:53,563 --> 01:33:55,724
We’ll keep up on the
surveillance as best we can.

1060
01:35:32,555 --> 01:35:34,776
The high-res version, can
you get closer than that?

1061
01:35:34,811 --> 01:35:36,394
Yeah, well, you can up-res this image.

1062
01:35:36,818 --> 01:35:37,745
Even more?

1063
01:35:39,296 --> 01:35:40,529
Okay, that’s good. Thank you.

1064
01:35:44,521 --> 01:35:45,975
I’ll take that. Thank you very much.

1065
01:35:46,002 --> 01:35:47,831
— Take that too.
— You got it-“ch”.

1066
01:35:48,112 --> 01:35:50,579
.. to clean that audio as well,
just take the low one out.

1067
01:36:05,715 --> 01:36:06,437
Hey.

1068
01:36:08,366 --> 01:36:10,966
All right, so tell me
how I’m doing so far.

1069
01:36:10,978 --> 01:36:13,968
Basically, we had a guy who rolled
with al-Qaeda, and did services for him.

1070
01:36:13,988 --> 01:36:15,508
— Mm–hm.
— We lost him for seven years.

1071
01:36:15,534 --> 01:36:19,081
Now we find him again, and… boy,
does he have a really nice house.

1072
01:36:19,108 --> 01:36:21,488
— Is that it?
— Pretty much.

1073
01:36:22,132 --> 01:36:24,383
All right, let’s go talk to the boss.

1074
01:36:29,327 --> 01:36:31,555
Oh, you, uh, you should sit back there.

1075
01:36:32,475 --> 01:36:33,378
— Sorry.
— No.

1076
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:40,563
So they’re gonna ask,

1077
01:36:41,437 --> 01:36:43,457
if bin Laden is at the
end of this rainbow…

1078
01:36:44,592 --> 01:36:46,142
is the Pak military with him?

1079
01:36:46,762 --> 01:36:49,154
The question isn’t: Are the
Paks protecting bin Laden?

1080
01:36:49,435 --> 01:36:52,167
The question is: Would he allow
himself to be protected by the Paks?

1081
01:36:52,751 --> 01:36:55,259
I mean, why would he trust
them? He tried to kill Musharraf.

1082
01:37:04,526 --> 01:37:05,727
— Hello.
— Sir.

1083
01:37:07,701 --> 01:37:08,698
All right, go ahead.

1084
01:37:09,398 --> 01:37:12,645
So a little context here, if you
take a right, out of Islamabad,

1085
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:16,386
drive about forty-five minutes north,
you’ll find yourself here in Abbottabad.

1086
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:20,204
Now it’s a mostly middle-class
community, some ex-military.

1087
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:22,129
Not particularly interesting to us.

1088
01:37:22,472 --> 01:37:25,380
Except we did find this
compound, which is unique.

1089
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:29,231
We got a 16–foot wall
around the entire perimeter.

1090
01:37:29,253 --> 01:37:30,730
The windows are blacked out.

1091
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:33,425
There’s even a 7–foot
privacy wall here, so,

1092
01:37:33,796 --> 01:37:36,246
even if we got up high, we
couldn’t get a vantage point.

1093
01:37:36,381 --> 01:37:37,139
I mean it’s—

1094
01:37:37,457 --> 01:37:38,771
it’s a fortress.

1095
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:41,027
Well, can’t you put a camera somewhere?

1096
01:37:41,874 --> 01:37:44,544
In these trees here, maybe?
Get a look in the main house?

1097
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:46,478
It would probably be discovered.

1098
01:37:49,152 --> 01:37:51,370
Well, we have to get a look
into the house, don’t we?

1099
01:37:57,202 --> 01:37:58,018
All right.

1100
01:37:58,914 --> 01:38:01,235
What’s this? This cluster
of buildings down here?

1101
01:38:01,294 --> 01:38:04,018
The PMA. It’s the
Pakistani Military Academy.

1102
01:38:06,734 --> 01:38:08,153
It’s their West Point.

1103
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:16,096
And how close is that to the house?

1104
01:38:17,284 --> 01:38:18,167
About a mile.

1105
01:38:18,634 --> 01:38:21,740
4,221 feet. It’s closer
to eight–tenths of a mile.

1106
01:38:23,091 --> 01:38:24,072
But who are you?

1107
01:38:24,283 --> 01:38:26,725
I’m the motherfucker that
found this place, sir.

1108
01:38:29,267 --> 01:38:30,196
Really?

1109
01:38:35,126 --> 01:38:38,327
All right, I wanna know more about who’s
inside this house by the end of the week

1110
01:38:40,855 --> 01:38:41,818
Sir.

1111
01:38:51,271 --> 01:38:52,371
Motherfucker.

1112
01:38:54,754 --> 01:38:55,463
Good.

1113
01:39:13,595 --> 01:39:14,668
Morning, George.

1114
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:17,939
21 days.

1115
01:39:18,799 --> 01:39:21,800
It’s been 21 days since we found
the house, nothing’s happened.

1116
01:39:57,779 --> 01:39:58,479
Yeah.

1117
01:39:58,514 --> 01:39:59,543
<i>Maya, it’s Steve.</i>

1118
01:40:00,069 --> 01:40:02,941
— Swing by, I wanna show you something.
— Okay.

1119
01:40:03,911 --> 01:40:06,267
Okay, you can leave it paused for now,
but we’re gonna play through that—

1120
01:40:06,295 --> 01:40:06,995
Hey!

1121
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:09,370
— Maya, come see.
— Yeah.

1122
01:40:11,603 --> 01:40:13,318
Okay, this is from a
few minutes ago, okay?

1123
01:40:13,426 --> 01:40:14,126
Yeah.

1124
01:40:14,305 --> 01:40:17,629
So remember, we’ve got two
males, two females and seven kids.

1125
01:40:17,664 --> 01:40:18,364
What’s that?

1126
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:20,545
Okay, I’m saying that’s
Bushra, the brother’s wife.

1127
01:40:20,623 --> 01:40:22,206
Whoa, whoa, how do you know the gender?

1128
01:40:22,508 --> 01:40:24,659
Well, look, this is a clothesline
right here for laundry.

1129
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:25,868
Men don’t mess with the wash.

1130
01:40:26,082 --> 01:40:29,089
Okay, now watch, it takes her about
four seconds to move from there,

1131
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:31,172
to the front door, so
she’s on the older side.

1132
01:40:31,868 --> 01:40:34,547
— What’s that up there?
— Uh, those are kids, they’re

1133
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:37,333
shuffling around, sword fighting
or something, with sticks.

1134
01:40:37,368 --> 01:40:39,811
You can see their height
relative to this. These are cows.

1135
01:40:39,902 --> 01:40:41,888
So, they’re probably between 7 and 9.

1136
01:40:41,914 --> 01:40:44,577
— Boys, definitely.
— Wow, your female’s moving fast.

1137
01:40:44,665 --> 01:40:47,241
Okay, that’s what I wanted to
show you. Can we pause this please?

1138
01:40:47,612 --> 01:40:48,782
That’s not the same lady.

1139
01:40:49,421 --> 01:40:50,731
That’s female number three.

1140
01:40:53,454 --> 01:40:57,143
— So you found two males, three females.
— That’s correct.

1141
01:40:59,496 --> 01:41:02,271
So, if there are three females,
there ought to be three males.

1142
01:41:03,014 --> 01:41:06,969
Observant Muslim women live with
their parents, over their husbands.

1143
01:41:07,912 --> 01:41:10,797
We think there’s a third
family, living in the house.

1144
01:41:11,795 --> 01:41:15,127
So, this third male that you’ve
identified as possibly being bin Laden,

1145
01:41:15,162 --> 01:41:17,407
do I give up all hope of ever
seeing a photograph of him?

1146
01:41:18,249 --> 01:41:20,243
Hope? Yeah.

1147
01:41:21,044 --> 01:41:23,054
You give up your hope, right now.

1148
01:41:23,793 --> 01:41:25,862
We scan for heat signatures.

1149
01:41:26,135 --> 01:41:29,202
But we can’t validate if it’s
a man or a woman up there.

1150
01:41:31,049 --> 01:41:33,834
We talked about burrowing a
pinhole camera, but there’s a…

1151
01:41:33,872 --> 01:41:35,325
high risk of discovery.

1152
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:38,992
We found a safe house,

1153
01:41:39,223 --> 01:41:43,151
but we can’t get a vantage point to
fire a telescope over the balcony wall.

1154
01:41:43,292 --> 01:41:45,484
We have explored the possibility,

1155
01:41:45,546 --> 01:41:48,388
of digging tunnels, of
sending hot air balloons,

1156
01:41:48,423 --> 01:41:53,320
of rerouting supply C-130s to take a
peek, but that might be too alerting.

1157
01:41:53,657 --> 01:41:57,273
We’ve looked for ways of collecting
available DNA from his trash,

1158
01:41:57,335 --> 01:41:59,966
you know, looking for his
toothbrush, but they burn the trash.

1159
01:42:01,304 --> 01:42:03,393
We started a vaccination program,

1160
01:42:04,144 --> 01:42:06,607
sent a doctor to the house,
see if he could pull blood.

1161
01:42:10,764 --> 01:42:12,228
But that didn’t work out.

1162
01:42:14,154 --> 01:42:15,921
We thought about sending
a guy with a bucket,

1163
01:42:16,016 --> 01:42:19,127
to pull a sample from the sewer,
to analyze his fecal matter.

1164
01:42:19,176 --> 01:42:20,782
What was wrong with that, exactly?

1165
01:42:21,924 --> 01:42:23,669
What was wrong with that? That, uh…

1166
01:42:25,197 --> 01:42:26,888
The sample would be too diluted.

1167
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:31,182
And it’s asking too much to get a voice
confirmation with him on the phone?

1168
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:34,313
They don’t make telephone
calls from the compound.

1169
01:42:34,353 --> 01:42:36,024
We pulled the cell tower nearby.

1170
01:42:36,173 --> 01:42:40,572
And I’m also going to give up hope that
he might ever get in that white SUV, and…

1171
01:42:42,453 --> 01:42:45,538
drive around a bit and we could see him.

1172
01:42:46,116 --> 01:42:47,250
Don’t they get groceries?

1173
01:42:47,865 --> 01:42:50,496
The unidentified third
male does not get groceries.

1174
01:42:50,942 --> 01:42:54,361
He does not leave the compound; he does
not present himself for photographs.

1175
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:59,135
When he needs fresh air, he paces
around, beneath a grape arbor.

1176
01:42:59,588 --> 01:43:02,854
But the leaves are so thick,
they obscure our satellite views.

1177
01:43:03,002 --> 01:43:07,317
This is a professional
attempt to avoid detection.

1178
01:43:07,842 --> 01:43:09,837
Okay? Real tradecraft.

1179
01:43:10,874 --> 01:43:12,052
The only people we’ve seen

1180
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:15,361
behave in this way, are other
top-level al-Qaeda operatives.

1181
01:43:15,612 --> 01:43:17,617
We did a red team on your analysis.

1182
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:22,455
According to them, this behavior could
belong to someone other than al-Qaeda.

1183
01:43:22,517 --> 01:43:26,099
They did give a 40 percent chance
that the unidentified third man…

1184
01:43:26,114 --> 01:43:27,904
is a senior al-Qaeda operative.

1185
01:43:28,447 --> 01:43:31,735
But they also said there’s a 35
percent chance he’s a Saudi drug dealer.

1186
01:43:31,988 --> 01:43:34,197
15 percent chance he’s
a Kuwaiti arms smuggler.

1187
01:43:34,252 --> 01:43:36,790
10 percent chance he’s one of
the relatives of the brothers.

1188
01:43:37,184 --> 01:43:39,570
Basically, we agree with you.
The house screams security.

1189
01:43:39,745 --> 01:43:43,077
It screams someone who wants
privacy; it even screams bad guy.

1190
01:43:43,099 --> 01:43:46,179
— But it does not scream bin Laden.
— You get the point?

1191
01:43:46,552 --> 01:43:49,546
If you can’t prove it’s bin Laden,
at least prove it’s not someone else.

1192
01:43:50,606 --> 01:43:51,810
Like a drug dealer.

1193
01:43:56,934 --> 01:44:00,886
You know we lost the ability to prove
them when we lost the Detainee Program.

1194
01:44:01,185 --> 01:44:03,493
Who the hell am I supposed to ask? Huh?

1195
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:06,555
Some guy in Gitmo who’s all lawyered up?

1196
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:09,065
He’ll just tell his
lawyer to warn bin Laden.

1197
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,207
You’ll think of something.

1198
01:44:32,202 --> 01:44:36,221
He’d be the first successful drug
dealer never to have dealt drugs.

1199
01:44:36,739 --> 01:44:41,705
He has no internet access to the house;
he makes no phone calls either in or out

1200
01:44:41,813 --> 01:44:45,403
Who’s he selling to? Who’s he buying
from? How’s he making his money?

1201
01:44:45,456 --> 01:44:48,519
And if you were to say, “He’s retired,”
I’d say, “Where’s the swimming pool?”

1202
01:44:49,493 --> 01:44:52,180
Where’s the gold cage with the falcons?

1203
01:44:53,584 --> 01:44:55,053
And why does he send his courier

1204
01:44:55,142 --> 01:44:58,992
to the two cities in Pakistan,
we most associate with al-Qaeda,

1205
01:44:59,019 --> 01:45:02,466
that have nothing particularly
to do with heroin production.

1206
01:45:03,122 --> 01:45:07,724
The president is a thoughtful,
analytical guy. He needs proof.

1207
01:45:19,771 --> 01:45:21,340
Go ahead, you guys.

1208
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,067
I gotta say, your job…

1209
01:45:26,582 --> 01:45:27,543
— Hmm.
— Huh.

1210
01:45:28,687 --> 01:45:30,926
I just don’t get the rhythms of politics.

1211
01:45:31,655 --> 01:45:34,280
Oh, you think this is political?
If this was political,

1212
01:45:34,315 --> 01:45:37,438
we’d be having this conversation in
October, when there’s an election bump.

1213
01:45:37,849 --> 01:45:43,662
This is pure risk, based on deductive
reasoning, inference, supposition,

1214
01:45:43,784 --> 01:45:47,393
and the only human reporting
you have is six years old,

1215
01:45:47,422 --> 01:45:49,935
from detainees, who were
questioned under duress.

1216
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:52,683
The political move here is to
tell you to go fuck yourself,

1217
01:45:52,718 --> 01:45:58,316
and remind you, that I was in the room,
when your old boss pitched WMD Iraq.

1218
01:45:58,613 --> 01:46:00,500
At least, there, you
guys brought photographs.

1219
01:46:00,555 --> 01:46:03,347
You know, you’re right, I agree
with everything you just said.

1220
01:46:04,716 --> 01:46:07,232
What I meant was, a man in your position…

1221
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:12,035
How do you evaluate the
risk of not doing something?

1222
01:46:13,172 --> 01:46:13,906
Hmm?

1223
01:46:14,346 --> 01:46:17,822
The risk of potentially letting
bin Laden slip through your fingers.

1224
01:46:19,573 --> 01:46:21,192
That is a fascinating question.

1225
01:46:25,614 --> 01:46:26,429
Hey.

1226
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,065
I’m not saying we’re gonna do it,

1227
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:36,922
but the president wants to
know, if we were gonna act,

1228
01:46:37,683 --> 01:46:38,882
how would we do it?

1229
01:46:39,606 --> 01:46:40,929
Give us options.

1230
01:47:15,476 --> 01:47:17,238
Technically, these don’t exist.

1231
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:20,072
I actually tried to kill this
program a couple of times.

1232
01:47:21,281 --> 01:47:23,912
They’ve gone through, uh,
an initial round of testing,

1233
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,981
and they have excellent radar defeat.

1234
01:47:27,184 --> 01:47:29,046
We just haven’t tested
with people in them yet.

1235
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:34,298
You’ll notice these stealth panels,
similar to what we use on the B-2.

1236
01:47:34,514 --> 01:47:37,035
The rotors have been
muffled with decibel killers.

1237
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:40,851
It’s slower than a Black Hawk,
lacks the offense and the stability.

1238
01:47:41,143 --> 01:47:42,281
But, it can hide.

1239
01:47:42,423 --> 01:47:46,753
So, uh, e—excuse me, but what do we—what
do we need this for in—in Libya. I mean,

1240
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:48,908
Gaddafi’s anti-air is
virtually non-existent.

1241
01:47:50,699 --> 01:47:52,839
Maya, do you wanna brief ‘em?

1242
01:48:01,154 --> 01:48:05,080
There are two narratives, about
the location of Osama bin Laden.

1243
01:48:05,412 --> 01:48:06,985
The one that you’re most familiar with,

1244
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,912
is that UBL is hiding in
a cave in the tribal areas.

1245
01:48:10,073 --> 01:48:13,073
That he’s surrounded by a large
contingent of loyal fighters.

1246
01:48:13,851 --> 01:48:17,262
But that narrative is
pre-9/11 understanding of UBL.

1247
01:48:17,766 --> 01:48:20,595
The second narrative, is
that he’s living in a city.

1248
01:48:21,284 --> 01:48:24,677
Living in a city with multiple
points of egress and entry,

1249
01:48:25,187 --> 01:48:29,647
Access to communications, so that he
can keep in touch with the organization.

1250
01:48:30,922 --> 01:48:34,292
You can’t run a global network of
interconnected cells from a cave.

1251
01:48:34,966 --> 01:48:38,736
We’ve located an individual, we
believe, based on detainee reporting,

1252
01:48:38,811 --> 01:48:40,400
is bin Laden’s courier.

1253
01:48:41,082 --> 01:48:43,853
He’s living in a house,
in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

1254
01:48:44,859 --> 01:48:46,302
And we assess,

1255
01:48:47,953 --> 01:48:50,772
that one of the other
occupants of the house,

1256
01:48:51,283 --> 01:48:52,644
is UBL.

1257
01:49:03,965 --> 01:49:04,884
General.

1258
01:49:13,043 --> 01:49:13,897
Excuse me.

1259
01:49:14,942 --> 01:49:18,422
Uh, so, UBL, you got—you got
an intel source on the ground?

1260
01:49:21,047 --> 01:49:23,076
— No.
— No?

1261
01:49:24,401 --> 01:49:26,464
Okay, so how do you know it’s bin Laden?

1262
01:49:27,651 --> 01:49:29,468
’Cause the truth is, we’ve
been on this op before.

1263
01:49:29,503 --> 01:49:32,538
It was ‘07, and it wasn’t bin
Laden, and we lost a couple of guys.

1264
01:49:32,935 --> 01:49:33,940
Totally understand.

1265
01:49:34,162 --> 01:49:36,652
Bin Laden uses a courier, to
interact with the outside world.

1266
01:49:36,693 --> 01:49:39,382
By locating the courier,
we’ve located bin Laden.

1267
01:49:39,655 --> 01:49:40,989
That’s really the intel.

1268
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:42,912
That’s it?

1269
01:49:43,852 --> 01:49:45,746
Quite frankly, I didn’t
even wanna use you guys.

1270
01:49:45,757 --> 01:49:48,000
With your dip and your velcro
and all your gear bullshit.

1271
01:49:48,005 --> 01:49:49,209
I wanted to drop a bomb.

1272
01:49:49,721 --> 01:49:52,343
But people didn’t believe in
this lead enough to drop a bomb.

1273
01:49:52,872 --> 01:49:55,383
So, they’re using you guys, as canaries,

1274
01:49:55,518 --> 01:49:58,795
in a theory that if bin Laden
isn’t there, you can sneak away,

1275
01:49:58,830 --> 01:50:00,893
— and no one will be the wiser.
— Hmm.

1276
01:50:01,378 --> 01:50:03,589
But bin Laden, is there.

1277
01:50:05,836 --> 01:50:07,543
And you’re gonna kill him for me.

1278
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:14,526
They’re nervous downtown.

1279
01:50:15,110 --> 01:50:17,740
I don’t think we’ll get an approval.
This decision is not going—

1280
01:50:31,814 --> 01:50:33,154
It’s her against the world.

1281
01:50:34,228 --> 01:50:35,343
Oh, yeah.

1282
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:41,170
I’m about to go look
the president in the eye.

1283
01:50:41,861 --> 01:50:44,680
And what I’d like to
know, no fucking bullshit,

1284
01:50:45,432 --> 01:50:47,306
is where everyone stands on this thing.

1285
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:53,390
Now, very simply, is he there,
or is he not fucking there?

1286
01:50:54,795 --> 01:50:57,887
We all come at this, through the
filter of our own past experiences.

1287
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,817
Now I remember Iraq WMD,
very clearly. I fronted that.

1288
01:51:02,006 --> 01:51:05,276
And I can tell you the case for that,
was much stronger than this case.

1289
01:51:05,391 --> 01:51:06,886
A fucking “yes” or a “no”.

1290
01:51:07,190 --> 01:51:09,698
We don’t deal in certainty,
we deal in probability.

1291
01:51:09,847 --> 01:51:13,685
And I’d say there’s a 60
percent probability he’s there.

1292
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:18,891
I concur, 60 percent.

1293
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:23,769
I’m at 80 percent, their
OPSEC is what convinces me.

1294
01:51:25,939 --> 01:51:29,155
— You guys ever agree on anything?
— Well, I agree with Mike.

1295
01:51:29,876 --> 01:51:32,032
We’re basing this mostly
on detainee reporting,

1296
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:36,798
and I spent a bunch of time in those
rooms. I’d say it’s a soft 60, sir.

1297
01:51:37,241 --> 01:51:39,778
I’m virtually certain there’s
some high value target there,

1298
01:51:39,806 --> 01:51:41,437
I’m just not sure it’s bin Laden.

1299
01:51:43,776 --> 01:51:46,599
Well, this is a little bit
of a cluster fuck, isn’t it?

1300
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:49,489
I’d like to know what Maya thinks.

1301
01:51:49,624 --> 01:51:51,627
We’re all incorporating
her assessment into ours.

1302
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:53,336
A hundred percent he’s there.

1303
01:51:56,047 --> 01:51:58,851
Okay, fine, 95 percent ‘cause I
know certainty freaks you guys out,

1304
01:51:58,993 --> 01:52:00,575
but it’s a hundred.

1305
01:52:15,071 --> 01:52:16,269
They’re all cowed.

1306
01:52:20,116 --> 01:52:23,074
— What do you think of the girl?
— I think she’s fucking smart.

1307
01:52:24,175 --> 01:52:25,926
We’re all smart, Jeremy.

1308
01:52:33,907 --> 01:52:35,162
May I join you?

1309
01:52:39,332 --> 01:52:41,077
How is the food down here anyway?

1310
01:52:42,194 --> 01:52:43,287
Uh, it’s okay.

1311
01:52:44,739 --> 01:52:48,032
— How long have you worked for the CIA?
— Twelve years.

1312
01:52:48,443 --> 01:52:51,638
— I was recruited out of high school.
— And do you know why we did that?

1313
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:54,324
I don’t think I can answer that
question, sir.

1314
01:52:54,631 --> 01:52:57,681
I don’t think I’m allowed to… answer.

1315
01:52:58,177 --> 01:52:59,104
All right.

1316
01:53:01,219 --> 01:53:04,608
What else have you done for us?
Besides bin Laden?

1317
01:53:06,018 --> 01:53:07,053
Nothing.

1318
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:09,898
I’ve done nothing else.

1319
01:53:13,231 --> 01:53:15,071
Well, you certainly have a flair for it.

1320
01:53:44,271 --> 01:53:45,017
No?

1321
01:53:46,085 --> 01:53:46,834
Yeah.

1322
01:53:47,547 --> 01:53:48,841
All right, let’s be serious now.

1323
01:53:48,889 --> 01:53:50,883
Yeah don’t fuck around on this one, dude.

1324
01:53:51,462 --> 01:53:53,690
You’re just fuckin’ around,
’cause you see I’m up by two games.

1325
01:53:53,996 --> 01:53:54,881
How many you got?

1326
01:54:05,411 --> 01:54:06,678
Patrick, be honest with me.

1327
01:54:07,369 --> 01:54:08,797
You really believe this story?

1328
01:54:10,734 --> 01:54:13,874
I mean, no offense, no
offense, I know, but,

1329
01:54:14,405 --> 01:54:16,001
Osama bin Laden?

1330
01:54:17,772 --> 01:54:20,043
— Yeah.
— What part convinced you?

1331
01:54:22,228 --> 01:54:23,278
Her confidence.

1332
01:54:24,487 --> 01:54:27,766
That’s the kinda concrete
data point I’m looking for.

1333
01:54:28,336 --> 01:54:29,184
I tell you, buddy.

1334
01:54:29,214 --> 01:54:30,502
Her confidence is the one thing

1335
01:54:30,537 --> 01:54:32,652
that’s keeping me from getting
ass-raped in some Pakistani prison.

1336
01:54:32,687 --> 01:54:34,072
I’m gonna be honest with you, bro.

1337
01:54:36,377 --> 01:54:37,336
I’m cool with it.

1338
01:54:44,852 --> 01:54:45,579
Yeah.

1339
01:54:46,272 --> 01:54:49,234
<i>Maya, I wanted you to hear it first.</i>

1340
01:54:50,194 --> 01:54:51,728
You know that thing we talked about?

1341
01:54:51,817 --> 01:54:52,704
<i>It’s gonna happen.</i>

1342
01:54:52,737 --> 01:54:54,750
— When?
— Tonight.

1343
01:54:56,944 --> 01:54:57,878
<i>Good luck.</i>

1344
01:54:58,498 --> 01:54:59,734
— Fifty bucks?
— Fifty bucks.

1345
01:55:00,173 --> 01:55:01,531
Fifty bucks.

1346
01:55:02,157 --> 01:55:03,042
Fifty bucks.

1347
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:08,616
It’s a lucky shot.

1348
01:55:12,818 --> 01:55:14,566
— Fuck.
— Go.

1349
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:54,965
Copy.

1350
01:56:56,322 --> 01:56:57,148
Copy that.

1351
01:58:45,058 --> 01:58:46,444
<i>Thirty seconds to first turn.</i>

1352
01:58:49,268 --> 01:58:51,009
Hey, Justin, what’re you listening to?

1353
01:58:51,565 --> 01:58:55,070
— Tony Robbins.
— Tony Robbins, really?

1354
01:58:55,179 --> 01:58:58,071
You should listen to it.
I got plans for after this.

1355
01:58:58,811 --> 01:59:00,670
Big time. I wanna talk
to all of you about it.

1356
01:59:23,294 --> 01:59:25,281
Who here’s been in a helo crash before?

1357
01:59:28,839 --> 01:59:30,301
OK, then we’re all good.

1358
01:59:46,227 --> 01:59:48,764
<i>We’ve just crossed the
border, now entering Pakistan.</i>

1359
01:59:49,183 --> 01:59:50,974
Pakistani comms, no chatter.

1360
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:18,011
<i>Three minutes, stand by for doors open.</i>

1361
02:00:32,874 --> 02:00:33,781
<i>Two minutes.</i>

1362
02:01:10,868 --> 02:01:13,530
<i>Should be coming up just
off our nose, eleven o’clock.</i>

1363
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:22,585
<i>Eyes on target.</i>

1364
02:01:27,389 --> 02:01:28,570
Stay tight.

1365
02:01:33,019 --> 02:01:34,063
Three seconds.

1366
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:45,402
Hey! Slide right! Slide right!
Too much updraft! Now, hurry up!

1367
02:02:49,375 --> 02:02:51,349
<i>We’ve lost power.
Go to lock-out.</i>

1368
02:02:57,287 --> 02:02:58,049
Hey!

1369
02:03:01,453 --> 02:03:02,331
<i>Hard landing!</i>

1370
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:22,672
<i>Prince Five–One is down.</i>

1371
02:03:24,052 --> 02:03:25,718
<i>Black Hawk down in the animal pen.</i>

1372
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:40,532
This way!

1373
02:03:47,368 --> 02:03:49,841
<i>This mission is still a “go”,
I repeat, we are a “go”.</i>

1374
02:03:49,875 --> 02:03:53,089
<i>Alpha Team is in the animal
pen, making entry for AC1.</i>

1375
02:03:59,434 --> 02:04:01,241
No ropes, wheels down.

1376
02:04:42,996 --> 02:04:44,339
Prayer room’s clear.

1377
02:05:15,683 --> 02:05:16,599
Breacher!

1378
02:05:40,383 --> 02:05:44,516
<i>Echo Team is away, Prince
Five–Two exiting Alpha–Oscar.</i>

1379
02:05:52,396 --> 02:05:53,104
Three…

1380
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:54,544
Two…

1381
02:05:55,309 --> 02:05:56,016
One…

1382
02:05:56,072 --> 02:05:56,810
Execute!

1383
02:07:07,527 --> 02:07:08,475
Ibrahim!

1384
02:07:10,376 --> 02:07:11,267
C’mon out!

1385
02:07:25,685 --> 02:07:27,088
“Erfa Edak!” (Hands up!)

1386
02:07:27,542 --> 02:07:28,244
Get down!

1387
02:07:28,292 --> 02:07:29,955
— Down, down, down, down…
— “Yalla! Yalla!” Come on!

1388
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,847
Throw your hands in the air!

1389
02:07:30,882 --> 02:07:32,299
— “Yalla! Yalla!”
— Down! Down! Down! Down!

1390
02:07:32,564 --> 02:07:33,311
Down!

1391
02:07:33,966 --> 02:07:35,608
You’ve killed him!

1392
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:38,006
— Let’s go.
— I got her.

1393
02:07:59,227 --> 02:08:00,109
“Taht, taht, taht…” (Under)

1394
02:08:00,164 --> 02:08:00,883
Hey.

1395
02:08:01,437 --> 02:08:03,177
“Yalla! Yalla! Ijlisoo!
Ijlisoo!” (Go sit!)

1396
02:08:03,203 --> 02:08:05,820
— “Ma’laysh, ma’laysh.” (Don’t worry)
— Down! Sit down!

1397
02:08:46,226 --> 02:08:49,138
— Echo Eleven on perimeter.
— Ready to breach at P2.

1398
02:08:55,603 --> 02:08:56,727
Fire in the hole.

1399
02:09:01,704 --> 02:09:03,611
Failed breach, failed breach.

1400
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:05,646
Back it up.

1401
02:09:05,794 --> 02:09:07,691
Back it up… main gate.

1402
02:09:19,381 --> 02:09:20,682
We got an unlocked door.

1403
02:09:33,677 --> 02:09:34,580
Abrar!

1404
02:09:37,342 --> 02:09:38,592
Abrar…

1405
02:09:40,499 --> 02:09:41,568
Abrar!

1406
02:10:19,484 --> 02:10:21,885
It’s okay.

1407
02:10:23,745 --> 02:10:24,669
<i>This is Echo Eleven.</i>

1408
02:10:24,704 --> 02:10:25,909
We’re gonna breach the main gate.

1409
02:10:25,944 --> 02:10:27,681
<i>Negative, this is Echo Zero–One, I’m…</i>

1410
02:10:27,716 --> 02:10:29,236
internal on the corridor.

1411
02:10:29,509 --> 02:10:30,553
<i>I’ll let you guys in.</i>

1412
02:10:30,735 --> 02:10:31,626
<i>Roger that.</i>

1413

Shut that fucking kid up, please.

1414
02:11:19,642 --> 02:11:20,397
Talk to me.

1415
02:11:20,958 --> 02:11:22,599
No fucking way we can blow this thing.

1416
02:11:22,801 --> 02:11:25,412
God–fucking–damnit,
can you pop it manually?

1417
02:11:25,896 --> 02:11:26,645
No.

1418
02:11:26,727 --> 02:11:27,502
<i>Alpha–Three…</i>

1419
02:11:27,617 --> 02:11:31,442
This is Echo Eleven, we’re at
primary set-point, prepping to breach.

1420
02:11:31,695 --> 02:11:34,683
<i>Wait one, we’re
internal on the south side.</i>

1421
02:11:34,796 --> 02:11:36,194
This is a negative breach.

1422
02:11:36,236 --> 02:11:38,585
Roger, ready to make our entry out here.

1423
02:11:38,797 --> 02:11:40,479
Yeah, roger that, we’re
coming to meet you.

1424
02:11:40,516 --> 02:11:42,812
Stay with these kids, and
don’t let them in that backroom.

1425
02:12:02,468 --> 02:12:03,742
— Good?
— Yeah, bud.

1426
02:12:04,229 --> 02:12:07,877
Yeah. I forgot, were we
supposed to crash that helo?

1427
02:12:08,732 --> 02:12:10,507
Ibrahim tried to shoot through the door.

1428
02:12:10,726 --> 02:12:12,743
— Oh, yeah?
— I popped him from outside.

1429
02:12:12,896 --> 02:12:15,154
Oh, I fucking smoked Abrar…

1430
02:12:15,212 --> 02:12:16,112
and his wife.

1431
02:12:17,251 --> 02:12:18,299
She still alive?

1432
02:12:19,274 --> 02:12:22,004
— She’s gonna bleed out.
— What a fucking mess.

1433
02:12:22,032 --> 02:12:22,911
Yeah.

1434
02:12:26,508 --> 02:12:27,661
Go, go, go!

1435
02:12:50,736 --> 02:12:54,714
This is Echo Zero–Nine, we have unknowns
gathering in the southwest rooftops.

1436
02:13:05,753 --> 02:13:07,051
Locked gate blocking the stairs.

1437
02:13:07,086 --> 02:13:07,978
Breacher up.

1438
02:13:15,697 --> 02:13:16,834
Back it up, back up.

1439
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:32,102
Hey, back it up.

1440
02:13:33,761 --> 02:13:34,635
Watch out.

1441
02:13:35,678 --> 02:13:36,572
Execute.

1442
02:13:39,683 --> 02:13:40,467
Go, go!

1443
02:13:40,502 --> 02:13:42,802
This is Echo Zero–Five moving to level 2.

1444
02:13:56,184 --> 02:13:57,460
Hakim, get those guys back.

1445
02:14:18,551 --> 02:14:19,449
Khalid…

1446
02:14:21,114 --> 02:14:22,000
Khalid…

1447
02:14:27,508 --> 02:14:29,445

1449
02:14:50,185 --> 02:14:52,651
Yalla! Yalla!

1450
02:15:06,144 --> 02:15:07,994
Hakim, get him back, or
I’ll start smokin’ ‘em.

1451
02:15:08,005 --> 02:15:09,457
Wait, wait, wait.

1452
02:15:18,716 --> 02:15:20,524
Go back! They will kill you!

1453

Go back!

1455
02:15:34,775 --> 02:15:35,652
No vest.

All clear.

1457
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,953
Whoa, fucking shit.

1458
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:56,058

Down.

1462
02:16:37,911 --> 02:16:38,911
Got a possible jackpot.

<i>— Roger that, possible jackpot.</i>
— Shit.

1464

It’s okay.

1465
02:16:45,411 --> 02:16:46,285
It’s okay.

1466
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:49,882
Get down.

02:17:01,894 --> 02:17:03,287
Hey!

1471
02:17:05,566 --> 02:17:07,269
— Huh?
— Noori Hasan.

1472
02:17:07,562 --> 02:17:10,239
— Yo, she says it’s not him.
— Talk to the kid.

1473

Hey, what’s up?

1496
02:18:53,021 --> 02:18:54,839
I shot the third floor guy.

1497

I need more time than that.

Moving through!

02:25:57,244 --> 02:25:58,701
— that many of ‘em, right?
— Collect all media!

1537
02:25:58,736 --> 02:26:01,079
— CDs, DVDs?
— Who’s got a Sharpie?

02:26:03,979 --> 02:26:06,091
— Right here.

Nice job.

Come on, mark all media!

Video cameras, where—where was it found?

Yes, sir.

One moment, please.

That’s the only name they gave me.

You can sit wherever you want,
you’re the only one on the manifest.

1557
02:28:53,227 --> 02:28:55,013
You must be pretty important.

1558
02:28:55,737 --> 02:28:57,737
You got the whole plane to yourself.

1559
02:28:58,677 --> 02:29:00,677
Where do you wanna go?
