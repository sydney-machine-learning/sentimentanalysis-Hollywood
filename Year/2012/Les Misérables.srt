00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:56,299
Look down, look down

3
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,106
Don’t look them in the eye

4
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:03,300
Look down, look down

5
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,994
You’re here until you die.

6
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,583
No God above

7
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:12,900
And Hell alone below

8
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,417
Look down, look down

9
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:19,745
There’s twenty years to go.

10
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:22,605
I’ve done no wrong

11
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:25,586
Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!

12
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,224
Look down, look down

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,872
Sweet Jesus doesn’t care.

14
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:35,610
I know she’ll wait

15
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,055
I know that she’ll be true-

16
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,358
Look down, look down

17
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,913
They’ve all forgotten you.

18
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:49,162
When I get free
You won’t see me

19
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,787
Here for dust!

20
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:55,543
Look down, look down

21
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:58,535
You’ll always be a slave.

22
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,848
Look down, look down

23
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:05,854
You’re standing in your grave.

24
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:11,839
Retrieve the flag.

25
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:02,151
Now Prisoner 24601

26
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,208
Your time is up
And your parole’s begun.

27
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:07,387
You know what that means?

28
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:10,931
Yes. It means I’m free.

29
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:14,692
No. For long to the left
Of your itinerary,

30
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,410
This badge of shame
You’ll show it until you die.

31
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,869
It warns you’re a dangerous man.

32
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:22,986
I stole a loaf of bread

33
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:27,051
My sister’s child was close to death

34
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:30,153
– We were starving.
– You will starve again

35
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:33,133
Unless you learn the meaning of the law.

36
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:36,555
I know the meaning of those nineteen years

37
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:41,508
A slave of the law!

38
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:44,283
Five years for what you did,

39
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:47,007
The rest because you tried to run.

40
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:49,608
Yes, 24601!

41
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,684
My name is Jean Valjean!

42
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,588
And I’m Javert!

43
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:58,647
Do not forget my name.

44
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:01,283
Do not forget me-

45
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,912
24601!

46
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:09,484
Look down, look down

47
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:12,855
You’ll always be a slave.

48
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:16,043
Look down, look down

49
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,657
You’re standing in your grave.

50
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:45,209
Freedom at last-

51
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:46,994
How strange the taste!

52
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:52,806
Never forget the years- the waste,

53
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,525
Nor forgive them
for what they’ve done.

54
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:03,168
They are the guilty-
Everyone!

55
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:07,886
The day begins
And now lets see

56
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:13,692
What this new world
Will do for me!

57
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:31,933
– Can I help?
– A day’s work?

58
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,457
Papers?

59
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,715
No work here.

60
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:46,554
Valjean, as a dangerous man,
You will be on parole forever,

61
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,106
Failure to report means immediate arrest.

62
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:52,893
Be in Pontalliers in thirty days.

63
00:06:59,238 --> 00:07:00,638
Follow him.

64
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,598
Let me see your papers.

65
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,612
You show him the papers.

66
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:14,127
I'll sleep in the stable, please.

67
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,979
No way, get out.

68
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,219
Come in, sir, for you are weary

69
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,999
And the night is cold out here.

70
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,073
Though our lives are very humble

71
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:54,999
What we have we have to share.

72
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:59,202
There is wine here to revive you.

73
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:04,109
There is bread to make you strong.

74
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:09,627
There’s a bed to rest till morning-

75
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:15,599
Rest from pain, and rest from wrong.

76
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:26,604
Bless the food we eat today.

77
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:31,699
Bless our dear sister
And our honoured guest.

78
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,482
Get in there.
Put it down.

79
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:13,387
Stay there.

80
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,165
Monsignor…

81
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,150
We have your silver,
We caught the man red-handed!

82
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:24,994
He has the nerve to say
you gave him all this!

83
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:27,554
That is right.

84
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:31,486
But my friend, you left so early,

85
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,672
Surely something slipped your mind

86
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:38,687
You forgot I gave these also.

87
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:42,765
Would you leave the best behind?

88
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:50,804
Messieurs, release him.

89
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:53,138
This man has spoken true.

90
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,676
I commend you for your duty

91
00:09:57,157 --> 00:10:00,998
Now God’s blessing go with you.

92
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:06,285
But remember this, my brother-

93
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:11,299
See in this some higher plan.

94
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:16,100
You must use this precious silver

95
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,776
To become an honest man.

96
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:26,405
By the witness of the martyrs,

97
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:30,907
By the passion and the blood,

98
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:35,576
God has raised you out of darkness-

99
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:40,504
I have saved your soul

100
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:48,609
for God.

101
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:07,191
What have I done,
Sweet Jesus, what have I done?

102
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:10,457
Become a thief in the night
Become a dog on the run!

103
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,939
Have I fallen so far
And is the hour so late

104
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,923
That nothing remains
but the cry of my hate?

105
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,916
The cries in the dark
that nobody hears

106
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:25,439
Here where I stand
at the turning of the years.

107
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:27,923
If there’s another way to go

108
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:30,524
I missed it twenty long years ago.

109
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,306
My life was a war
that could never be won.

110
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:35,737
They gave me a number
and murdered Valjean

111
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:38,150
When they chained me
and left me for dead

112
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,581
Just for stealing a mouthful of bread!

113
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:56,660
Yet why did I allow this man

114
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,799
To touch my soul and teach me love?

115
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,681
He treated me like any other

116
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:09,572
He gave me his trust
He called me brother.

117
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:14,726
My life he claims for God above…

118
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,153
Can such things be?

119
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:23,213
For I had come to hate the world-

120
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,690
This world that always hated me!

121
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:32,672
Take an eye for an eye!

122
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:37,747
Turn your heart into stone!

123
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:41,184
This is all I have lived for!

124
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:49,676
This is all I have known!

125
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:53,710
One word from him and I'll be back

126
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,466
Beneath the lash
Upon the rack

127
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:01,972
Instead he offers me my freedom

128
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:07,122
I feel my shame inside me like a knife.

129
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:11,466
He told me that I have a soul…

130
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:16,340
How does he know?

131
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,002
What spirit comes to move my life?

132
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:29,769
Is there another way to go?

133
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:34,295
I am reaching, but I fall

134
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:38,592
And the night is closing in…

135
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:43,152
As I stare into the void-

136
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:47,542
To the whirlpool of my sin.

137
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:51,836
I’ll escape now from that world-

138
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,192
From the world of Jean Valjean.

139
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:58,392
Jean Valjean is nothing now!

140
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:06,549
Another story must begin!

141
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:51,857
At the end of the day
you’re another day older

142
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:55,591
And that’s all you can say
for the life of the poor.

143
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:58,682
It’s a struggle!
It’s a war!

144
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:00,747
And there’s nothing
that anyone’s giving.

145
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:03,559
One more day standing about-
What is it for?

146
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:07,096
One day less to be living.

147
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:10,963
At the end of the day
you’re another day colder

148
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:14,945
And the shirt on your back
doesn’t keep out the chill.

149
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,482
And the righteous hurry past

150
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:19,507
They don’t hear
the little ones crying

151
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:22,780
And the plague is coming on fast
Ready to kill-

152
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:26,207
One day nearer to dying!

153
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,091
At the end of the day
there’s another day dawning

154
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:34,119
And the sun in the morning
is waiting to rise

155
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:36,643
Like the waves crash on the sand

156
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:38,930
Like a storm that’ll break any second

157
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:42,820
There’s a hunger in the land

158
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:46,334
And there’s gonna be hell to pay

159
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,940
At the end of the day!

160
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:52,064
At the end of the day
you get nothing for nothing!

161
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:55,793
Sitting flat on your bum
doesn’t buy any bread!

162
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,853
There are children back at home-

163
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,697
And the children have got to be fed.

164
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,541
And you’re lucky to be in a job-

165
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:03,947
And in a bed!

166
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,202
And we’re counting our blessings!

167
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,811
Have you seen how
the foreman is fuming today

168
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:15,130
With his terrible breath
and his wandering hands?

169
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,575
It’s because little Fantine
won’t give him his way.

170
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,900
Take a look at his trousers,
you’ll see where he stands!

171
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:23,845
And the boss, he never knows

172
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,809
That the foreman is always on heat.

173
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:28,864
If Fantine doesn’t look out,
Watch how she goes,

174
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:31,594
She’ll be out on the street!

175
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,000
At the end of the day
its another day over

176
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:39,838
With enough in your pocket
to last for a week

177
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:42,757
Pay the landlord, pay the shop

178
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:44,874
Keep on working as long as you’re able

179
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:46,647
Keep on working till you drop

180
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,725
Or it’s back to the crumbs off the table

181
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,291
Well, you’ve got to pay your way

182
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:54,049
At the end of the day!

183
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,081
And what have we here,
little innocent sister?

184
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:02,030
Oh come on, Fantine,
let’s have all the news.

185
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:05,930
"Dear Fantine,
you must send us more money,

186
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:08,501
Your child needs a doctor,
There’s no time to lose".

187
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:12,093
Give that letter to me
It is none of your business.

188
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,960
With a husband at home
And a bit on the side!

189
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:19,868
Is there anyone here
Who can swear before God

190
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:22,073
She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?

191
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:28,331
Hey! Come on, stop that.

192
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:30,352
Mr. Madeleine's here.

193
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:32,581
What is this fighting all about?

194
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:34,557
Will someone tear these two apart?

195
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:36,573
This is a factory, not a circus.

196
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:41,268
Now come on, ladies, settle down.

197
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:43,522
I am the mayor of this town

198
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:45,413
I run a business of repute.

199
00:18:00,694 --> 00:18:02,098
Deal with this, Foreman.

200
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:04,371
Be as patient as you can.

201
00:18:04,973 --> 00:18:06,502
Yes, monsieur Madeleine.

202
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:08,791
Now… someone say how this began!

203
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,900
At the end of the day
she’s the one who began it!

204
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,962
There’s a kid that she’s hiding
in some little town.

205
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,240
There’s a man she has to pay

206
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,308
You can guess how
she picks up the extra-

207
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:18,081
You can bet she’s earning her keep

208
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,472
Sleeping around!

209
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,767
And the boss wouldn’t like it.

210
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:26,834
Yes, it’s true there’s a child
And the child is my daughter

211
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,133
And her father abandoned us,
Leaving us flat.

212
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:34,907
Now she lives with an
innkeeper man and his wife

213
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,510
And I pay for the child.
What’s the matter with that?

214
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,659
At the end of the day
she’ll be nothing but trouble

215
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:45,184
And there’s trouble for all
when there’s trouble for one!

216
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:48,180
While we’re earning our daily bread

217
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:50,312
She’s the one with her hands
in the butter-

218
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:52,265
You must send the slut away

219
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,258
Or we’re all going to end in the gutter

220
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:57,717
And it’s us who’ll have to pay

221
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,155
At the end of the day!

222
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:01,011
I might have known the bitch could bite!

223
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,180
I might have known the cat had claws!

224
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:06,790
I might have guessed your little secret!

225
00:19:06,902 --> 00:19:10,829
Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine,

226
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,743
Who keeps herself so pure and clean-

227
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,779
You’d be the cause, I had no doubt

228
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:17,834
Of any trouble hereabout.

229
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:19,826
You play a virgin in the light

230
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:21,880
But need no urging in the night!

231
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,838
She’s been laughing at you
While she’s having her men!

232
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,660
She’ll be nothing but trouble
again and again!

233
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:30,301
– You must sack her today!
– Sack the girl today!

234
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,289
Right, my girl.
On your way.

235
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,882
Monsieur le Maire. Monsieur le Maire!
Monsieur le Maire! Monsieur le Maire!

236
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:44,371
Monsieur! Please!

237
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:00,942
Welcome, Inspector.

238
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,440
Monsieur le Maire.

239
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,705
Please know me as Javert.

240
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:11,901
I’m here at your command

241
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:13,838
With honour due to each.

242
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,084
And justice in our hands

243
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,991
No man’s beyond our reach.

244
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,215
Let all beware.

245
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:27,642
Welcome, sir
Come guard our laws

246
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:31,597
I’m sure we’re here
In common cause.

247
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,613
You’ve done the city proud,

248
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:36,066
You’re praised by those on high.

249
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,523
Your success is her defaults,

250
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:41,367
The best that parents can supply.

251
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:44,247
Your people thrive.

252
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,431
The dignity of toil

253
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:51,293
To stay alive.

254
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,688
It seems to me
We may have met.

255
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:02,111
Your face is not a face I would forget.

256
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:07,893
– Monsieur Madeleine!
– Pardon.

257
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,838
Monsieur le Maire!

258
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,076
Monsieur le Maire!

259
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:15,186
The weight.

260
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:18,062
– It's crushing him!
– Stay still, stay still.

261
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:21,463
Come on!

262
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,872
Hold, hold, hold!
Hold that still.

263
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:26,856
Hold that still!

264
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,492
Let him…
That's it.

265
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,833
Can this be true?

266
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:49,839
I don’t believe what I see!

267
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,817
A man your age

268
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,402
To be as strong as you are!

269
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,274
A memory stirs…

270
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:02,904
You make me think of a man

271
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:05,086
From years ago

272
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:08,279
A man who broke his parole…

273
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,302
He disappeared.

274
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:14,365
Say what you must,
Don’t leave it there.

275
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:20,438
Forgive me sir,
I would not dare.

276
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:24,176
Excuse me.

277
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:45,205
Bonsoir.
How much for this?

278
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:48,197
It's made of this.
– I'll give you four francs for that.

279
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:51,179
– Four, it's worth ten!
– Too…

280
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:54,310
I smell women,
Smell’em in the air!

281
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:57,239
Think I’ll drop me anchor
In that harbour over there!

282
00:22:57,294 --> 00:23:00,012
Lovely ladies!
I love ‘em till I'm broke!

283
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:03,362
Seven months at sea and now
I'm Hungry for a poke!

284
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:06,534
Even stokers need a little stoke!

285
00:23:06,622 --> 00:23:09,640
Lovely ladies
Waiting for a bite!

286
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,835
Waiting for the customers
Who only come at night.

287
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:15,582
Lovely ladies
Ready for the call,

288
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,716
Standing up or lying down
Or any way at all

289
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:22,060
Bargain prices up against the wall!

290
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:24,283
What pretty hair!

291
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,326
What pretty locks you’ve got there!

292
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:29,641
What luck you got.

293
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:32,872
It’s worth a centime, my dear!

294
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:35,450
I’ll take the lot!

295
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:38,026
Don’t touch me! Leave me alone!

296
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:40,631
Let’s make a price.

297
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:44,135
I’ll give you all of ten francs.

298
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:46,816
Just think of that!

299
00:23:47,722 --> 00:23:49,522
It pays a debt…

300
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:51,464
Just think of that.

301
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:56,137
What can I do?
It pays a debt.

302
00:23:56,777 --> 00:24:00,993
Ten francs may save my poor Cosette.

303
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:07,709
Lovely ladies
Waiting in the dark.

304
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,915
Ready for a thick one
Or a quick one in the park.

305
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:14,218
Long time, short time
Any time my dear!

306
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:17,140
Cost a little extra
If you want to take all year

307
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:19,747
Quick and cheap is underneath the pier!

308
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:21,696
Go and see them.

309
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,146
Come over here,

310
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:26,094
It's twenty francs for a tooth.

311
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:28,136
Come here my dear.

312
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:30,677
I’ll pay well for your youth.

313
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,947
The pain won’t last,

314
00:24:33,113 --> 00:24:35,665
You’ll still be able to bite.

315
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:38,091
I do it fast,

316
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:40,345
I know my business all right.

317
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:42,978
It’s worth a go.

318
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,846
You’ll pay me first
What I am due.

319
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:50,534
You’ll get twice If I take two!

320
00:24:57,947 --> 00:25:00,673
Gimme the dirt-
Who’s that bit over there?

321
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,746
A bit of skirt,
She’s the one sold her hair.

322
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,941
She’s got a kid,
Sends her all that she can.

323
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:09,796
I might’ve known
There is always some man.

324
00:25:09,906 --> 00:25:13,180
Lovely lady, come along and join us!

325
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:14,930
Lovely lady!

326
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:20,658
Come on, dearie, why all the fuss?

327
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:24,643
You’re no grander than the rest of us.

328
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:28,476
Life has dropped you
at the bottom of the heap.

329
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:32,583
Join your sisters
– Make money in your sleep!

330
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:36,238
That’s right, dearie,
Show him what you’ve got!

331
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:38,938
That’s right, dearie,

332
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:42,203
Let him have the lot!

333
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,671
Old men, young men, take’em as they come!

334
00:25:49,741 --> 00:25:53,020
Harbour rats and alley cats
And every kind of scum!

335
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:55,965
Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land-

336
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,160
See them with their trousers off,
They’re never quite as grand!

337
00:25:59,213 --> 00:26:02,214
All it takes is money in your hand!

338
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:08,196
Lovely ladies
Going for a song,

339
00:26:08,804 --> 00:26:14,262
Got a lot of callers
But they never stay for long…

340
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:24,931
Come on, Captain…
you can wear your shoes.

341
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:30,751
Don’t it make a change
to have a girl who can’t refuse?

342
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:35,687
Easy money lying on a bed.

343
00:26:36,906 --> 00:26:41,638
Just as well they never see
The hate that’s in your head!

344
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:46,456
Don’t they know they’re making love

345
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:52,651
To one already dead?

346
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:22,499
There was a time when men were kind,

347
00:27:24,464 --> 00:27:26,264
When their voices were soft

348
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:31,034
And their words inviting.

349
00:27:33,658 --> 00:27:36,773
There was a time when love was blind

350
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,507
And the world was a song

351
00:27:42,063 --> 00:27:45,711
And the song was exciting.

352
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:49,513
There was a time…

353
00:27:56,134 --> 00:28:00,211
Then it all went wrong.

354
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:19,746
I dreamed a dream in time gone by,

355
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,347
When hope was high
And life worth living.

356
00:28:30,164 --> 00:28:36,975
I dreamed that love would never die.

357
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:41,817
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.

358
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:52,949
Then I was young and unafraid

359
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:59,610
And dreams were made and used and wasted.

360
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:08,568
There was no ransom to be paid,

361
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:14,017
No song unsung, no wine untasted.

362
00:29:17,136 --> 00:29:23,618
But the tigers come at night

363
00:29:25,284 --> 00:29:32,040
With their voices soft as thunder

364
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:38,404
As they tear your hope apart

365
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:48,916
As they turn your dream to shame.

366
00:29:57,942 --> 00:30:03,823
He slept a summer by my side,

367
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:10,452
He filled my days with endless wonder.

368
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:18,082
He took my childhood in his stride

369
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,230
But he was gone when autumn came.

370
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:34,304
And still I dream he’ll come to me!

371
00:30:34,581 --> 00:30:39,704
That we will live the years together…

372
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:47,281
But there are dreams that cannot be

373
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:52,832
And there are storms we cannot weather…

374
00:30:58,384 --> 00:31:00,889
I had a dream my life would be

375
00:31:03,503 --> 00:31:07,822
So different from this hell I’m living-

376
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:14,711
So different now from what it seemed!

377
00:31:18,863 --> 00:31:21,540
Now…

378
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,446
life…

379
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,889
has killed…

380
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:30,538
the dream…

381
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:42,828
I dreamed.

382
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,076
What d'ya have for me?

383
00:32:07,077 --> 00:32:08,842
It's our youngest, sir.

384
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:15,832
I don’t want you!

385
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:19,259
You’ve got some nerve, you little slut!
You’ve got some gall!

386
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:26,330
By Christ you’ll pay for what you’ve done!

387
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,830
I guarantee I’ll make you suffer!

388
00:32:30,034 --> 00:32:33,336
I beg you, don’t report me, sir.
I’ll do whatever you may want.

389
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:35,798
Make your excuse to the police!

390
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:40,029
Tell me quickly what’s the story.

391
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,013
Who saw what and why and where?

392
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:44,191
Let him give a full description,

393
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:46,535
Let him answer to Javert!

394
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,694
Javert, would you believe it?

395
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:50,706
I was lost here in the dark,

396
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:53,008
When this prostitute attacked me

397
00:32:53,261 --> 00:32:55,852
You can see she’s left her mark!

398
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,609
She will answer for her actions

399
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,664
If you make a full report.

400
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:03,438
You may rest assured, Monsieur,

401
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,633
She will answer to the court.

402
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:08,373
There’s a child who sorely needs me,

403
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,037
Please, Monsieur, she’s but that high.

404
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,613
Holy God, is there no mercy?

405
00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:18,793
If I go to jail she’ll die.

406
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:21,877
I have heard such protestations

407
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:24,251
Every day for twenty years.

408
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:26,798
Let’s have no more explanations,

409
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:29,253
Save your breath and save your tears.

410
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:31,965
Honest works, just reward,

411
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:35,465
that's the way to please the law.

412
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:38,540
A moment of your time, Javert.

413
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:40,282
I do believe this woman’s tale.

414
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:42,097
Monsieur le Mayor!

415
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:44,108
You’ve done your duty.
Let her be.

416
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:45,811
She needs a doctor, not a jail.

417
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:47,288
Monsieur le Mayor!

418
00:33:47,304 --> 00:33:48,991
Can this be?

419
00:33:49,715 --> 00:33:52,122
Where will she end-

420
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:57,310
This child without a friend?

421
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:02,886
I’ve seen your face before.

422
00:34:06,632 --> 00:34:10,207
Show me some way to help you.

423
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:16,176
How have you come to grief

424
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,770
In such a place as this?

425
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,174
Monsieur, don’t mock me now, I pray

426
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:31,799
It’s hard enough I’ve lost my pride.

427
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:40,911
You let your foreman send me away.

428
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,958
Yes, you were there

429
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,841
And turned aside.

430
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,075
I never did no wrong.

431
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,458
Is it true what I’ve done-

432
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:03,370
My daughter’s close to dying.

433
00:35:03,422 --> 00:35:05,222
to an innocent soul?

434
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:08,766
If there’s a God above-

435
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,595
Had I only known then!

436
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:15,183
He’d let me die instead.

437
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,627
In His name my task has just begun.

438
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:25,508
I will take her to the hospital.

439
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:26,696
Monsieur le Mayor!

440
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:28,358
Where is your child?

441
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:30,421
With an innkeeper in Montfermeil…

442
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,957
I will send for her immediately.

443
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:38,020
I will see it done!

444
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,891
From Paris, Monsieur.

445
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:02,264
Monsieur le Mayor

446
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:04,816
I have a crime to declare!

447
00:36:05,806 --> 00:36:07,366
I have disgraced

448
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,246
The uniform that I wear.

449
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,189
I’ve done you wrong,

450
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:14,488
Let no forgiveness be shown.

451
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,123
I’ve been as hard

452
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,647
On every rogue I have known.

453
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:22,648
I mistook you for a convict,

454
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:24,996
I have made a false report.

455
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:27,404
Now I learn they’ve caught the culprit-

456
00:36:27,513 --> 00:36:29,662
He’s about to face the court.

457
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,588
And of course the thief denies it,

458
00:36:31,674 --> 00:36:33,745
You’d expect that from a con.

459
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,770
But he couldn’t run for ever,

460
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,708
No, not even Jean Valjean.

461
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,703
You say this man denies it all,

462
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:46,929
And gives no sign of
understanding or repentance?

463
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:49,191
You say this man is going to trial,

464
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:52,152
And that he’s sure to be
returned to serve his sentence?

465
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:56,564
He will pay, and so must I.

466
00:36:57,314 --> 00:37:00,037
Press charges against me, sir!

467
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,418
You have only done your duty

468
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,089
It’s a minor sin at most.

469
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,942
All of us have made misjudgements

470
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:12,638
You’ll return, sir, to your post.

471
00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:28,873
They think that man is me-

472
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,020
Without a second glance.

473
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,820
This stranger they have found-

474
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:35,846
This man could be my chance!

475
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:38,646
Why should I save his hide?

476
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:40,762
Why should I right this wrong?

477
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:43,739
When I have come so far

478
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,997
And struggled for so long?

479
00:37:48,189 --> 00:37:50,155
If I speak…

480
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:53,038
I am condemned.

481
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:56,583
If I stay silent…

482
00:37:57,417 --> 00:38:00,771
I am damned!

483
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:03,566
I am the master of hundreds of workers-

484
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:05,153
They all look to me.

485
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:07,765
Can I abandon them?

486
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:10,046
How would they live
If I am not free?

487
00:38:13,302 --> 00:38:16,932
If I speak they are condemned.

488
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,887
If I stay silent…

489
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:27,156
I am damned!

490
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:33,563
Who am I?

491
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,521
Can I condemn this man to slavery?

492
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,084
Pretend I do not feel his agony?

493
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,202
This innocent who bears my face,

494
00:38:47,294 --> 00:38:49,562
Who goes to judgement in my place…

495
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:50,809
Who am I?

496
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,056
Can I conceal myself for ever more?

497
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:58,368
Pretend I’m not the man I was before?

498
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,420
And must my name until I die

499
00:39:02,494 --> 00:39:04,662
Be no more than an alibi?

500
00:39:04,746 --> 00:39:05,946
Must I lie?

501
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,400
Ηоw саn Ι еvеr fасе my fеllоw mеn?

502
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,210
How can I ever face myself again?

503
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,085
My soul belongs to God, I know,

504
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:19,475
I made that bargain long ago.

505
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:23,053
He gave me hope when hope was gone!

506
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:28,980
He gave me strength to journey on!

507
00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:31,712
Who am I?

508
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:37,057
Who am I?

509
00:39:38,205 --> 00:39:39,573
I’m Jean Valjean!

510
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:43,827
Monsieur le Mayor!

511
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:46,614
And so, your honour, you see it’s true

512
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:51,618
That man bears no more guilt than you!

513
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,740
Who am I?

514
00:39:56,185 --> 00:40:02,518
24601!

515
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:07,323
Monsieur le Mayor, you are not well,
you must come with me.

516
00:40:07,386 --> 00:40:10,690
You'll believe me, ask inspector Javert.
He will find me at the hospital.

517
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:33,107
Cosette, it’s turned so cold!

518
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:41,461
Cosette, it’s past your bedtime!

519
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:48,904
You’ve played the day away

520
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:56,056
And soon it will be night.

521
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:01,949
Come to me…

522
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:08,281
Cosette, the light is fading,

523
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:13,881
Don't you see…

524
00:41:15,217 --> 00:41:19,639
the evening star appearing?

525
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:25,072
Come to me…

526
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:31,227
and rest against my shoulder,

527
00:41:32,844 --> 00:41:40,358
How fast the minutes fly away
and every minute colder?

528
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,424
Dear Fantine,

529
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:47,895
Cosette will be here soon!

530
00:41:49,621 --> 00:41:55,115
Dear Fantine… she will be by your side

531
00:41:56,345 --> 00:42:03,384
Come Cosette…
my child, where did you go?

532
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:06,956
Be at peace!

533
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:14,142
Be at peace ever more.

534
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:17,576
My Cosette-

535
00:42:17,646 --> 00:42:21,752
shall live in my protection.

536
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:25,782
Take her now!

537
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,933
Your child will want for nothing.

538
00:42:32,414 --> 00:42:34,050
Good monsieur…

539
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:39,607
you come from God in heaven.

540
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,407
Tell Cosette…

541
00:42:46,751 --> 00:42:49,263
I love her…

542
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:53,514
and I see her…

543
00:42:54,558 --> 00:42:58,430
When I wake.

544
00:43:20,227 --> 00:43:22,997
Valjean, at last

545
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:26,357
We see each other plain!

546
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:29,047
"Monsieur le Mayor"

547
00:43:29,243 --> 00:43:32,951
You’ll wear a different chain!

548
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,620
Before you say another word, Javert,

549
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:38,581
Before you chain me up like a slave again,

550
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:44,020
Listen to me!
There is something I must do.

551
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,380
This woman leaves behind
a suffering child.

552
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:50,705
There is none but me who can intercede-

553
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:55,441
In mercy’s name,
three days are all I need,

554
00:43:56,743 --> 00:43:59,569
Then I’ll return, I pledge my word!

555
00:43:59,663 --> 00:44:02,473
– Then I’ll return…
– You must think me mad!

556
00:44:02,938 --> 00:44:05,670
I’ve hunted you across the years.

557
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:08,599
Men like you can never change-

558
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:14,535
A man such as you!

559
00:44:14,645 --> 00:44:17,642
– Believe of me what you will
– Men like you can never change.

560
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:20,509
– There is a duty that I’m sworn to do.
– Men like me can never change.

561
00:44:20,632 --> 00:44:23,684
– You know nothing of my life-
– No, 24601!

562
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:26,351
– All I did was steal some bread.
– My duty is to the law.

563
00:44:26,505 --> 00:44:29,109
– You know nothing of the world-
– You have no rights.

564
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:32,005
– You would sooner see me dead.
– Come with me, 24601!

565
00:44:32,098 --> 00:44:34,595
– But not before I see this justice done!
– Now the wheel has turned around-

566
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:37,681
– But not before I see this justice done!
Jean Valjean is nothing now.

567
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:40,398
– I am warning you, Javert,
– Dare you talk to me of crime

568
00:44:40,482 --> 00:44:43,203
– I’m a stronger man by far!
– And the price you had to pay.

569
00:44:43,273 --> 00:44:45,856
– There is power in me yet!
– Every man is born in sin

570
00:44:45,948 --> 00:44:48,888
– My race is not yet run!
– Every man must choose his way.

571
00:44:48,907 --> 00:44:51,336
You know nothing of Javert!

572
00:44:51,401 --> 00:44:54,195
I was born inside a jail.

573
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:56,945
I was born with scum like you.

574
00:44:57,009 --> 00:45:00,280
I am from the gutter too.

575
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:29,283
There is a castle on a cloud

576
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,183
I like to go there in my sleep.

577
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:38,663
Aren’t any floors for me to sweep,

578
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:43,385
Not in my castle on a cloud.

579
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:47,718
There is a lady all in white

580
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:51,535
Holds me and sings a lullaby.

581
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:55,934
She’s nice to see and she’s soft to touch

582
00:45:56,105 --> 00:46:01,024
She says, Cosette, I love you very much.

583
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:06,365
I know a place where no one’s lost

584
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:11,227
I know a place where no one cries.

585
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:15,990
Crying at all is not allowed,

586
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:21,504
Not in my castle on a cloud.

587
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,906
Now look who’s here!

588
00:46:25,133 --> 00:46:27,552
The little madam herself,

589
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:33,776
Pretending once again
She’s been so awfully good!

590
00:46:33,871 --> 00:46:35,845
Better not let me catch you slacking!

591
00:46:35,957 --> 00:46:37,900
Better not catch my eye!

592
00:46:37,971 --> 00:46:40,150
Ten rotten francs your mother sends me-

593
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:41,996
What is that going to buy?

594
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,754
Now take that pail,

595
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,645
My little Mademoiselle,

596
00:46:46,694 --> 00:46:49,582
And go and draw some water from the well.

597
00:46:51,234 --> 00:46:53,356
We should never have taken you in
In the first place-

598
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:54,903
How stupid the things that we do!

599
00:46:54,919 --> 00:46:57,465
Like mother, like daughter,
the scum of the street.

600
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:00,688
Mama!

601
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:03,203
Eponine, come my dear.
Eponine, let me see you.

602
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:05,623
You look very well
in that little blue hat!

603
00:47:07,998 --> 00:47:10,136
There’s some little girls
who know how to behave

604
00:47:10,156 --> 00:47:13,630
And they know what to wear
And I’m saying thank heaven for that!

605
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:16,317
Still there, Cosette?

606
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,901
Your tears will do you no good!

607
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:23,335
I told you to fetch some water
from the well in the wood.

608
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:27,826
Please do not send me out alone.

609
00:47:27,954 --> 00:47:31,123
Not in the darkness on my own.

610
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:34,627
Enough of that, or I’ll forget to be nice!

611
00:47:35,183 --> 00:47:39,313
You heard me ask for something,
And I never ask twice!

612
00:47:41,702 --> 00:47:43,700
Waky waky.
We're opening.

613
00:47:43,973 --> 00:47:46,942
I love you.
I love you so much.

614
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:57,761
My band of soaks,

615
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,543
My den of dissolutes,

616
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:05,113
My dirty jokes,

617
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:10,502
my always pissed as newts,

618
00:48:11,595 --> 00:48:15,820
My sons of whores…

619
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,193
No no no no no,
no tonight…

620
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,415
Spend their lives in my inn!

621
00:48:22,626 --> 00:48:24,618
Waky waky.

622
00:48:25,587 --> 00:48:29,475
Homing pigeons homing in-

623
00:48:29,754 --> 00:48:33,951
They fly through my doors,

624
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:40,000
And they crawl out on all fours.

625
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:42,740
– Daddy, here!
– Thank you darling.

626
00:48:44,584 --> 00:48:48,124
Welcome, Monsieur! Sit yourself down

627
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:51,676
And meet the best
Innkeeper in town!

628
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:56,673
As for the rest-
All of them crooks

629
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,888
Rooking the guests
And cooking the books.

630
00:49:02,156 --> 00:49:04,599
Seldom do you see

631
00:49:05,754 --> 00:49:08,552
Honest men like me

632
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:11,704
A gent of good intent

633
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:15,366
Who’s content to be-

634
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,638
Master of the house!
Doling out the charm

635
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:21,535
Ready with a handshake
And an open palm

636
00:49:21,593 --> 00:49:24,366
Tells a saucy tale
Makes a little stir

637
00:49:24,437 --> 00:49:27,200
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur

638
00:49:27,294 --> 00:49:30,057
Glad to do a friend a favour

639
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:32,760
Doesn’t cost me to be nice

640
00:49:33,259 --> 00:49:38,147
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price!

641
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:41,897
Master of the house!
Keeper of the zoo!

642
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:44,733
Ready to relieve’em
Of a sou or two-

643
00:49:44,787 --> 00:49:47,737
Watering the wine
Making up the weight

644
00:49:47,803 --> 00:49:50,598
Picking up their knick-knacks
When they can’t see straight

645
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:53,386
Everybody loves a landlord

646
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:55,880
Everybody’s bosom friend!

647
00:49:56,268 --> 00:50:00,294
I do whatever pleases
– Jesus! Won’t I bleed’em in the end!

648
00:50:00,673 --> 00:50:03,303
Master of the house!
Quick to catch your eye

649
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:06,116
Never wants a passer-by To pass him by!

650
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,194
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great

651
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:12,061
Comforter, philosopher and lifelong mate

652
00:50:12,124 --> 00:50:14,788
Everybody’s boon companion

653
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:17,285
Everybody’s chaperone-

654
00:50:17,398 --> 00:50:21,450
But lock up your valises-
Jesus! Won’t I skin you to the bone!

655
00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:24,939
Food beyond compare
Food beyond belief

656
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:28,072
Mix it in a mincer And pretend it’s beef

657
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:30,540
Kidney of a horse
Liver of a cat

658
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:33,382
Filling up the sausages
With this and that!

659
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:36,021
Residents are more than welcome

660
00:50:36,548 --> 00:50:38,802
Bridal suite is occupied

661
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:43,128
Reasonable charges
Plus some little extras on the side.

662
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:45,175
Yes! Oh, Santa!

663
00:50:45,377 --> 00:50:48,332
Charge’em for the lice
Extra for the mice

664
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,733
Two percent for looking
in the mirror twice.

665
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:53,989
Here a little slice There a little cut

666
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:56,809
Three percent for sleeping
with the window shut.

667
00:50:57,001 --> 00:50:59,325
When it comes to fixing prices

668
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:02,399
There are lots of tricks he knows

669
00:51:02,444 --> 00:51:05,492
How it all increases
All those bits and pieces-

670
00:51:05,523 --> 00:51:09,551
Jesus! It’s amazing how it grows.

671
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:11,973
Oh, sorry love!

672
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:15,064
Who's got something done about that?

673
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,036
I used to dream
That I would meet a prince

674
00:51:22,771 --> 00:51:24,448
But God almighty

675
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,312
Have you seen what’s happened since?

676
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:30,203
No? What?

677
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,766
‘Master of the house’

678
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:35,585
Isn’t worth my spit!

679
00:51:35,686 --> 00:51:38,039
Comforter, philosopher

680
00:51:38,122 --> 00:51:40,377
And lifelong shit!

681
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:43,143
Cunning little brain

682
00:51:43,304 --> 00:51:45,848
Regular Voltaire

683
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:48,317
Thinks he’s quite a lover

684
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,927
But there’s not much there.

685
00:51:51,168 --> 00:51:54,466
What a cruel trick of nature

686
00:51:55,004 --> 00:51:58,190
Landed me with such a louse.

687
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:02,262
God knows how I’ve lasted
Living with this bastard in the house!

688
00:52:03,223 --> 00:52:05,986
– Master of the house!
– Master and a half!

689
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:08,819
– Comforter, philosopher
– Don’t make me laugh!

690
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,739
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great-

691
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:14,754
Hypocrite and toady
And inebriate!

692
00:52:14,822 --> 00:52:17,595
Everybody bless the landlord!

693
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:20,118
Everybody bless his spouse!

694
00:52:20,161 --> 00:52:23,048
Everybody raise a glass!

695
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:26,502
Raise it up the master’s arse!

696
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:30,638
Everybody raise a glass
to the master of the house!

697
00:52:35,187 --> 00:52:38,882
Everybody bless the landlord…

698
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:03,417
Hush now, do not be afraid of me.

699
00:53:04,668 --> 00:53:08,571
Don’t cry. Show me where you live.

700
00:53:10,094 --> 00:53:13,352
Tell me, my child, what is your name?

701
00:53:15,045 --> 00:53:17,911
I’m called Cosette.

702
00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:22,609
Cosette?

703
00:53:22,984 --> 00:53:24,601
Can I help you with your bucket?

704
00:53:35,284 --> 00:53:36,844
I found her wandering in the wood

705
00:53:36,935 --> 00:53:39,668
This little child, I found her
trembling in the shadows.

706
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:42,740
And I am here to help Cosette,

707
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:45,777
And I will settle any debt
you may think proper.

708
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:50,149
I will pay what I must pay

709
00:53:51,593 --> 00:53:54,446
To take Cosette away.

710
00:53:56,802 --> 00:53:58,202
I love you.

711
00:53:59,856 --> 00:54:02,721
This is a duty I must heed.

712
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,649
There is a promise I have made.

713
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:13,694
For I was blind to one in need,

714
00:54:15,238 --> 00:54:18,378
I did not see what stood before me.

715
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,132
Now your mother is with God.

716
00:54:28,845 --> 00:54:31,608
Her suffering is over,

717
00:54:34,824 --> 00:54:39,213
And I speak here with her voice,

718
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:46,625
And I stand here in her place,

719
00:54:49,624 --> 00:54:52,699
and from this day, and ever more-

720
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:54,793
Let me take your coat, Monsieur!

721
00:54:55,341 --> 00:54:58,574
Cosette shall live in my protection.

722
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,613
You are very welcome here!

723
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:04,622
I will not forget my vow.

724
00:55:04,698 --> 00:55:07,057
– Take a drink!
– Take a chair!

725
00:55:07,115 --> 00:55:12,001
Cosette shall have a father now.

726
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:19,396
What to do? What to say

727
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:23,177
Shall you carry our treasure away?

728
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:27,221
What a gem! What a pearl!

729
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:31,073
Beyond rubies is our little girl!

730
00:55:31,813 --> 00:55:35,312
How can we talk of debt?

731
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:40,736
Let’s not haggle for darling Colette!

732
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:42,877
– Cosette.
– Cosette.

733
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:47,343
Dear Fantine- gone to rest-

734
00:55:47,539 --> 00:55:51,149
Have we done for her child what is best?
I think so.

735
00:55:51,501 --> 00:55:55,303
Shared our bread- shared each bone-

736
00:55:56,623 --> 00:55:59,023
Treated her like she’s one of our own!

737
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:01,516
– Yes our own.
– Like our own, Monsieur!

738
00:56:01,547 --> 00:56:02,937
Go sir, your turn.

739
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:05,440
Your feelings do you credit, sir.

740
00:56:06,011 --> 00:56:08,049
And I will ease the parting blow.

741
00:56:08,428 --> 00:56:12,621
Let us not talk of bargains
and bones and greed.

742
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,505
Now may I sa we are… agreed?

743
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:21,787
That would quite fit the bill

744
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:25,689
If she hadn’t so often been ill.

745
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:29,449
Little dear, cost us dear!

746
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:33,039
Medicines are expensive, Monsieur.

747
00:56:33,882 --> 00:56:37,161
Not that we begrudged a sou-

748
00:56:37,825 --> 00:56:42,955
It’s no more than we Christians must do.

749
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,558
No more words!
Here’s your price!

750
00:56:47,934 --> 00:56:51,590
Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice.

751
00:56:52,092 --> 00:56:55,113
Come, Cosette, say goodbye.

752
00:56:55,883 --> 00:56:59,535
Let’s seek out some friendlier skies.

753
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:03,005
Thank you both for Cosette-

754
00:57:03,634 --> 00:57:07,586
It won’t take you too long to forget.

755
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,222
Farewell, Courgette!

756
00:57:11,955 --> 00:57:13,105
It's Cosette.

757
00:57:13,207 --> 00:57:14,327
And hop!

758
00:57:16,238 --> 00:57:17,638
It's for you!

759
00:57:19,362 --> 00:57:22,223
Where I go, you will be.

760
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:26,464
Well, will you be like a Papa to me?

761
00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:28,145
Yes, Cosette!

762
00:57:28,317 --> 00:57:29,611
This is true!

763
00:57:30,642 --> 00:57:33,924
I’ll be father and mother to you!

764
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:41,610
– Not bad!
– Not enough!

765
00:57:41,665 --> 00:57:45,115
There’s a copper at the door!
What the devil have you done?

766
00:57:46,475 --> 00:57:48,275
Where’s the child Cosette?

767
00:57:49,923 --> 00:57:51,837
She’s gone with a gent,

768
00:57:52,088 --> 00:57:53,888
Didn’t tell us where they went,

769
00:57:54,935 --> 00:57:57,306
Didn’t leave his home address.

770
00:58:02,151 --> 00:58:04,673
You’re a bloody fool
Look at what we got.

771
00:58:04,744 --> 00:58:07,319
Should have struck the iron,
Struck it while it’s hot.

772
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:11,934
Next time round I promise
I'm gonna get the lot. Okay?

773
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:25,505
Suddenly you're here

774
00:58:26,872 --> 00:58:29,146
Suddenly it starts

775
00:58:30,221 --> 00:58:33,163
And two anxious hearts

776
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:35,132
Beat as one.

777
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:39,620
Yesterday I was alone

778
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:43,120
Today you walk beside me

779
00:58:44,556 --> 00:58:46,507
Something still unclear

780
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:50,078
Something not yet here

781
00:58:50,808 --> 00:58:52,954
Has begun.

782
00:58:57,999 --> 00:59:00,692
Suddenly the world

783
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,403
Seems a different place

784
00:59:04,362 --> 00:59:08,305
Somehow full of grace
And of light.

785
00:59:10,977 --> 00:59:14,685
How was I to know
That so much hope

786
00:59:14,737 --> 00:59:17,568
Was held inside me?

787
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:20,761
What is past is gone

788
00:59:21,768 --> 00:59:27,094
Now we join on through the night.

789
00:59:28,186 --> 00:59:30,965
How was I to know at last

790
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:34,121
That happiness can come so fast?

791
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,923
Trusting me the way you do

792
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,681
I’m so afraid of failing you

793
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,484
Just a child who cannot know

794
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:45,529
That danger follows where I go

795
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,537
There are shadows everywhere

796
00:59:48,902 --> 00:59:52,907
And memories I cannot share

797
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:56,813
Nevermore alone

798
00:59:57,698 --> 00:59:59,931
Nevermore apart

799
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:05,348
You have warmed my heart
Like the sun.

800
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:10,293
You have brought the gift of life

801
01:00:10,867 --> 01:00:15,059
And love so long denied me.

802
01:00:16,456 --> 01:00:18,836
Suddenly I see

803
01:00:20,132 --> 01:00:22,539
What I could not see

804
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:28,005
Something suddenly

805
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:34,353
Has begun.

806
01:00:44,428 --> 01:00:45,933
Le me see your papers.

807
01:00:48,074 --> 01:00:49,462
Where you travelling?

808
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,367
Cosette.

809
01:00:52,845 --> 01:00:54,694
Cosette, shh, shh!

810
01:00:54,927 --> 01:00:56,920
Here, give me the doll.

811
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,193
Come!

812
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:11,456
Valjean!

813
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:20,507
Like that. Run! Quick!

814
01:01:29,062 --> 01:01:30,921
24601!

815
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:03,871
Cosette. I've got you, come on.

816
01:02:06,938 --> 01:02:08,338
Valjean!

817
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:24,444
Te lucis ante terminum

818
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:30,728
Rerum Creator poscimus

819
01:02:31,534 --> 01:02:36,257
Ut pro tua clementia

820
01:02:36,302 --> 01:02:41,638
Sis praesul et custodia…

821
01:02:41,878 --> 01:02:42,909
Who’s that?

822
01:02:43,595 --> 01:02:46,538
Please, Monsieur!
I need your help.

823
01:02:47,686 --> 01:02:49,444
Please. Please.

824
01:02:53,493 --> 01:02:56,091
– Monsieur le Mayor!?
– Who are you?

825
01:02:56,772 --> 01:02:58,172
Fauchelevent.

826
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,092
I fell under my cart.

827
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:04,517
– You saved my life, monsieur.
– Fauchelevent…

828
01:03:05,572 --> 01:03:08,405
We need a place of sanctuary.
This child and I, we need…

829
01:03:08,476 --> 01:03:10,397
we need to disappear.

830
01:03:10,474 --> 01:03:14,262
We’ll give thanks for what is granted

831
01:03:15,636 --> 01:03:19,719
What the sisters may ordain

832
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:24,699
Here we pray for new beginnings-

833
01:03:25,121 --> 01:03:33,121
Here our lives can start again.

834
01:03:50,815 --> 01:03:55,953
There, out in the darkness

835
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,458
A fugitive running

836
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:04,237
Fallen from God

837
01:04:05,017 --> 01:04:08,529
Fallen from grace-

838
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:11,707
God be my witness

839
01:04:12,378 --> 01:04:15,222
I never shall yield

840
01:04:15,816 --> 01:04:18,578
Till we come face to face-

841
01:04:19,428 --> 01:04:22,273
Till we come face to face…

842
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:25,555
He knows his way in the dark

843
01:04:26,386 --> 01:04:30,446
Mine is the way of the Lord

844
01:04:30,506 --> 01:04:34,144
Those who follow the path of the righteous

845
01:04:34,254 --> 01:04:37,800
Shall have their reward

846
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:41,181
And if they fall
As Lucifer fell-

847
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:47,328
The flame! The sword!

848
01:04:47,953 --> 01:04:53,021
Stars in your multitudes!

849
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,581
Scarce to be counted

850
01:04:57,652 --> 01:05:00,558
Filling the darkness

851
01:05:01,228 --> 01:05:04,852
With order and light-

852
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:07,926
You are the sentinels

853
01:05:08,419 --> 01:05:10,863
Silent and sure

854
01:05:11,528 --> 01:05:13,810
Keeping watch in the night-

855
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:17,786
Keeping watch in the night…

856
01:05:18,779 --> 01:05:22,042
You know your place in the sky

857
01:05:22,328 --> 01:05:25,339
You hold your course
And your aim

858
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:29,310
And each in your season
Returns and returns

859
01:05:29,544 --> 01:05:33,341
And is always the same

860
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,998
And if you fall as Lucifer fell

861
01:05:37,412 --> 01:05:41,800
You fall in flame!

862
01:05:41,898 --> 01:05:46,204
And so it must be, for so it is written

863
01:05:46,399 --> 01:05:49,620
On the doorway to paradise

864
01:05:49,707 --> 01:05:52,704
That those who falter and those who fall

865
01:05:53,093 --> 01:05:55,770
Must pay the price!

866
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:04,993
Lord, let me find him

867
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:08,228
That I may see him

868
01:06:09,526 --> 01:06:13,159
Safe behind bars!

869
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:16,093
I will never rest

870
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:22,367
Till then, this I swear

871
01:06:59,873 --> 01:07:01,273
Come on, boys!

872
01:07:07,077 --> 01:07:08,124
Come on!

873
01:07:12,276 --> 01:07:17,664
Look down and see
the beggars at your feet!

874
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:24,032
Look down and show
some mercy if you can!

875
01:07:24,149 --> 01:07:29,566
Look down and see
the sweepings of the street!

876
01:07:29,931 --> 01:07:35,492
Look down, look down,
upon your fellow man!

877
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,948
‘Ow do you do? My name’s Gavroche!

878
01:07:39,369 --> 01:07:41,855
These are my people, here’s my patch.

879
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:44,581
Not much to look at– nothing posh!

880
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:47,430
Nothing that you’d call up to scratch.

881
01:07:47,794 --> 01:07:50,344
This is my school, my high society!

882
01:07:50,477 --> 01:07:52,732
Here in the slums of St Michel.

883
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:55,802
We live on crumbs of humble piety

884
01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:58,683
Tough on the teeth- but what the hell!

885
01:07:58,938 --> 01:08:01,433
Think you’re poor? Think you’re free?

886
01:08:01,564 --> 01:08:04,437
Follow me! Follow me!

887
01:08:04,506 --> 01:08:09,753
Look down and show some mercy if you can!

888
01:08:09,812 --> 01:08:15,505
Look down, look down,
upon your fellow man!

889
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:18,389
There was a time we killed the King

890
01:08:18,701 --> 01:08:21,405
We tried to change the world too fast.

891
01:08:21,624 --> 01:08:24,397
Now we have got another King,

892
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:27,090
He is no better than the last.

893
01:08:27,295 --> 01:08:30,113
This is the land that fought for liberty-

894
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,801
Now when we fight we fight for bread!

895
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:35,366
Here is the thing about equality-

896
01:08:35,421 --> 01:08:38,530
Everyone’s equal when they’re dead.

897
01:08:38,611 --> 01:08:41,116
Take your place! Take your chance!

898
01:08:41,188 --> 01:08:43,850
Vive la France! Vive la France!

899
01:08:43,931 --> 01:08:49,272
Look down and show some mercy if you can!

900
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:55,254
Look down, look down,
upon your fellow man!

901
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:58,026
– When’s it gonna end?
– When we gonna live?

902
01:08:58,066 --> 01:09:00,542
– Something’s gotta happen now!
– Something’s gotta give!

903
01:09:00,589 --> 01:09:03,500
It’ll come, it’ll come, it’ll come

904
01:09:03,548 --> 01:09:06,180
Where are the leaders of the land?

905
01:09:06,228 --> 01:09:08,913
Where is the King who runs this show?

906
01:09:08,988 --> 01:09:11,388
Only one man, General Lamarque

907
01:09:11,468 --> 01:09:14,122
Speaks for the people here below!

908
01:09:14,432 --> 01:09:17,114
Lamarque is ill and fading fast-

909
01:09:17,222 --> 01:09:19,876
Won’t last a week out, so they say.

910
01:09:19,927 --> 01:09:22,645
With all the anger in the land,

911
01:09:22,686 --> 01:09:25,348
How long before the Judgement Day?

912
01:09:25,408 --> 01:09:28,851
Before we cut the fat ones down to size?

913
01:09:28,929 --> 01:09:31,067
– Death to the King!
– Liberty for all!

914
01:09:31,123 --> 01:09:36,995
Before the barricades arise?

915
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,742
Courfeyrac, come tomorrow, we meet
here and build the barricades.

916
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:43,422
Bring your gun.

917
01:09:43,951 --> 01:09:46,831
Vive General Lamarque!
Vive General Lamarque!

918
01:09:46,902 --> 01:09:48,493
– Marius!
– Grand father.

919
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:53,573
Have you any idea of the shame
you bring on your family!

920
01:09:53,629 --> 01:09:55,275
It's a disgrace!

921
01:09:56,892 --> 01:10:00,561
Vive General Lamarque!
Vive General Lamarque!

922
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:07,161
Vive la France! Vive la France!
Vive la France!Vive la France!

923
01:10:15,054 --> 01:10:17,848
Hey there Monsieur what’s new with you?

924
01:10:18,133 --> 01:10:20,762
Haven’t seen much of you of late.

925
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:23,857
You still pretending to be poor

926
01:10:24,508 --> 01:10:26,771
Come on, I know your Grandpa’s rich

927
01:10:27,451 --> 01:10:29,748
Won’t take a franc that I’ve not earned

928
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:32,571
All of those bridges have been burned.

929
01:10:32,782 --> 01:10:35,405
I like the way you talk Monsieur!

930
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:38,373
I like the way you always tease.

931
01:10:43,992 --> 01:10:46,155
Little he knows-

932
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,544
Little he sees.

933
01:11:20,202 --> 01:11:21,270
Eponine!

934
01:11:22,665 --> 01:11:27,195
Everyone here, you know your place-
Brujon, Babet, Clacquesous

935
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:33,015
You, Montparnasse, watch for the law-
With Eponine- take care.

936
01:11:33,063 --> 01:11:37,115
You turn on the tears!
No mistakes, my dear!

937
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:44,009
Please, M’sieur, come this way.

938
01:11:44,145 --> 01:11:47,681
Here’s a child that ain’t eaten today.

939
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:51,425
Save a life, spare a sou!

940
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:56,621
God rewards all the good that you do.

941
01:11:57,026 --> 01:12:00,813
Wait a bit… Know that face!

942
01:12:02,723 --> 01:12:06,675
Ain’t the world a remarkable place!

943
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:11,269
Men like me don’t forget-

944
01:12:11,496 --> 01:12:14,703
You’re the bastard who borrowed Colette!

945
01:12:14,736 --> 01:12:15,856
– Cosette.
– Whatever.

946
01:12:15,919 --> 01:12:18,580
What is this? Are you mad?

947
01:12:19,147 --> 01:12:21,547
No, Monsieur, you don’t know what you say!

948
01:12:21,576 --> 01:12:22,779
You know me! I know you!

949
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:24,542
And you’ll pay what I’m due.

950
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:25,753
And you better dig deep!

951
01:12:25,793 --> 01:12:27,089
Cause she doesn't come cheap!

952
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:33,014
It’s the police! Disappear!
Run for it! It’s Javert!

953
01:12:33,038 --> 01:12:36,051
Cosette! Go, go!

954
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:38,832
Another brawl in the square!
Another stink in the air!

955
01:12:38,895 --> 01:12:41,760
Was there a witness to this?
Well, let him speak to Javert!

956
01:12:41,823 --> 01:12:45,422
Monsieur, these streets are not safe.
But let these vermin beware,

957
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,016
We’ll see that justice is done!

958
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:51,184
Look upon this fine collection

959
01:12:51,435 --> 01:12:54,010
Crawled from underneath a stone.

960
01:12:54,304 --> 01:12:56,682
This swarm of worms and maggots

961
01:12:56,816 --> 01:13:00,587
Could have picked you to the bone!

962
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,456
I know this man over here,
I know his name and his trade.

963
01:13:03,497 --> 01:13:06,401
And on your witness, Monsieur,
I’ll see him suitably paid.

964
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:13,062
But where’s the gentlemen gone?
And why on earth would he run?

965
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,234
You will have a job to find him!

966
01:13:16,462 --> 01:13:19,320
He’s not all he seems to be-

967
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:23,278
And that girl he trails behind him

968
01:13:23,781 --> 01:13:27,216
She’s the child he stole from me!

969
01:13:27,271 --> 01:13:30,071
– Yeah, and me.
– Yeah both of us.

970
01:13:30,224 --> 01:13:33,157
Could it be he’s that old jailbird

971
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:35,228
That the tide now washes in?

972
01:13:35,432 --> 01:13:37,915
Heard my name and started running…

973
01:13:38,002 --> 01:13:40,403
All the omens point to him.

974
01:13:40,474 --> 01:13:46,098
In the absence of a victim,

975
01:13:46,841 --> 01:13:51,681
Dear Inspector, may I go?

976
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:59,656
And remember when you’ve nicked him

977
01:14:00,828 --> 01:14:08,028
It was me what told you so.

978
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:11,018
Let the old man keep on running

979
01:14:11,171 --> 01:14:15,510
I will run him off his feet!

980
01:14:18,327 --> 01:14:22,606
Everyone about your business!
Clear this garbage off the street!

981
01:14:24,558 --> 01:14:29,017
Cosette! Now I remember…

982
01:14:30,124 --> 01:14:33,938
Cosette! How can it be?

983
01:14:35,306 --> 01:14:38,853
We were children together.

984
01:14:40,798 --> 01:14:45,446
Look what’s become of me.

985
01:14:47,952 --> 01:14:50,352
Eponine! Who was that girl?

986
01:14:50,406 --> 01:14:53,012
That bourgeois two-a-penny thing!

987
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:55,472
Eponine, find her for me!

988
01:14:55,888 --> 01:14:58,936
– What will you give me?
– Anything!

989
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,284
Got you all excited now, but

990
01:15:01,341 --> 01:15:03,516
God knows what you see in her.

991
01:15:04,008 --> 01:15:06,826
Aren’t you all delighted now? No…

992
01:15:08,544 --> 01:15:10,689
No, I don’t want your money, sir.

993
01:15:13,715 --> 01:15:17,512
Eponine, do this for me,

994
01:15:17,645 --> 01:15:20,158
Discover where she lives.

995
01:15:20,648 --> 01:15:22,736
But careful how you go-

996
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:25,549
Don’t let your father know.

997
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:31,357
Eponine! I’m lost until she’s found.

998
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:35,472
You see? I told you so!

999
01:15:36,813 --> 01:15:39,308
There’s lots of things I know!

1000
01:15:40,673 --> 01:15:43,256
Eponine…

1001
01:15:43,363 --> 01:15:51,180
ѕhе knоwѕ hеr wаy аrоund.

1002
01:15:55,185 --> 01:15:57,959
The time is near…

1003
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:02,727
So near it’s stirring
the blood in their veins.

1004
01:16:02,743 --> 01:16:05,454
And yet beware!

1005
01:16:06,633 --> 01:16:11,427
Don’t let the wine go to your brains.

1006
01:16:11,505 --> 01:16:13,838
We need a sign

1007
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:15,651
To rally the people

1008
01:16:15,749 --> 01:16:17,309
To call them to arms

1009
01:16:17,341 --> 01:16:19,934
To bring them in line!

1010
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:21,671
Marius, wake up!

1011
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,846
What’s wrong today?

1012
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:25,752
You look as if you’ve seen a ghost.

1013
01:16:26,073 --> 01:16:29,283
Some wine, and say what’s going on!

1014
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:32,300
A ghost, you say? A ghost maybe!

1015
01:16:32,552 --> 01:16:35,081
She was like a ghost to me-

1016
01:16:35,617 --> 01:16:38,358
One minute there- then she was gone!

1017
01:16:40,186 --> 01:16:42,866
I am agog! I am aghast!

1018
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,601
Is Marius in love at last?

1019
01:16:45,786 --> 01:16:50,077
I’ve never heard him Ooh and Aah.

1020
01:16:51,259 --> 01:16:53,501
You talk of battles to be won

1021
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,337
And here he comes like Don Juan!

1022
01:16:56,484 --> 01:17:01,567
It is better than an opera!

1023
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:10,977
It is time for us all
To decide who we are.

1024
01:17:11,956 --> 01:17:16,782
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now?

1025
01:17:17,682 --> 01:17:22,540
Have you asked of yourselves
What’s the price you might pay?

1026
01:17:23,532 --> 01:17:27,295
Is this simply a game
For a rich young boy to play?

1027
01:17:27,447 --> 01:17:33,884
The colours of the world
Are changing day by day-

1028
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:38,632
Red- the blood of angry men!

1029
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:43,114
Black- the dark of ages past!

1030
01:17:43,271 --> 01:17:47,135
Red- a world about to dawn!

1031
01:17:47,331 --> 01:17:53,586
Black- the night that ends at last!

1032
01:17:53,658 --> 01:17:58,554
Had you seen her today
You might know how it feels

1033
01:17:58,773 --> 01:18:04,101
To be struck to the bone
By a moment of breathless delight!

1034
01:18:04,374 --> 01:18:08,360
Had you been there today
You might also have known

1035
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:13,615
How the world may be changed
In just one burst of light

1036
01:18:13,717 --> 01:18:20,529
And what was right seems wrong
And what was wrong seems right!

1037
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:24,885
– Red!
– I feel my soul on fire!

1038
01:18:25,044 --> 01:18:28,907
– Black!
– My world if she’s not there!

1039
01:18:28,988 --> 01:18:32,892
– Red!
– The colour of desire!

1040
01:18:32,955 --> 01:18:37,696
– Black!
– The colour of despair!

1041
01:18:37,869 --> 01:18:39,876
Marius, you’re no longer a child-

1042
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,749
I do not doubt you mean it well

1043
01:18:41,905 --> 01:18:45,199
But now there is a higher call!

1044
01:18:46,065 --> 01:18:48,348
Who cares about your lonely soul?

1045
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:50,825
We strive towards a larger goal-

1046
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:54,529
Our little lives don’t count at all!

1047
01:18:55,329 --> 01:18:59,459
– Red!
– The blood of angry men!

1048
01:18:59,632 --> 01:19:03,872
– Black!
– The dark of ages past!

1049
01:19:04,013 --> 01:19:08,131
– Red-
– a world about to dawn!

1050
01:19:08,305 --> 01:19:16,015
Black- the night that ends at last!

1051
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:17,871
Listen, everybody!

1052
01:19:18,678 --> 01:19:20,436
General Lamarque is dead!

1053
01:19:23,362 --> 01:19:28,209
Lamarque… His death is the hour of fate.

1054
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:30,638
The people’s man…

1055
01:19:31,979 --> 01:19:38,232
His death is the sign we await!

1056
01:19:38,326 --> 01:19:40,377
On his funeral day
they will honour his name

1057
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:43,494
With the light of rebellion
ablaze in their eyes.

1058
01:19:43,673 --> 01:19:46,557
From their candles of grief
we will kindle our flame.

1059
01:19:46,617 --> 01:19:49,944
On the tomb of Lamarque
shall our barricades rise!

1060
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:52,153
The time is here!

1061
01:19:52,277 --> 01:19:55,200
Let us welcome it gladly
with courage and cheer!

1062
01:19:55,326 --> 01:19:58,542
Let us take to the street
with no doubt in our hearts

1063
01:19:58,568 --> 01:20:02,722
– But a jubilant shout!
– They will come one and all!

1064
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:09,922
They will come when we call!

1065
01:20:13,568 --> 01:20:14,982
Did you find her?

1066
01:20:23,336 --> 01:20:24,716
How strange-

1067
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:28,341
This feeling that my life’s begun at last!

1068
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,777
This change-

1069
01:20:31,683 --> 01:20:34,527
Can people really fall in love so fast?

1070
01:20:35,841 --> 01:20:38,668
What’s the matter with you, Cosette?

1071
01:20:39,091 --> 01:20:41,934
Have you been too much on your own?

1072
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:45,412
So many things unclear-

1073
01:20:45,576 --> 01:20:50,073
So many things unknown…

1074
01:20:52,354 --> 01:20:54,438
In my life

1075
01:20:55,304 --> 01:20:59,942
There are so many questions and
answers that somehow seem wrong.

1076
01:21:01,241 --> 01:21:02,441
In my life

1077
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:08,387
There are times when I catch in the
silence the sigh of a faraway song

1078
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:10,178
And it sings

1079
01:21:11,427 --> 01:21:14,740
Of a world that I long to see-
Out of reach

1080
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:19,471
Just a whisper away
Waiting for me!

1081
01:21:20,212 --> 01:21:23,975
Does he know I’m alive?
Do I know if he’s real?

1082
01:21:24,783 --> 01:21:28,727
Does he see what I see?
Does he feel what I feel?

1083
01:21:29,855 --> 01:21:31,569
In my life

1084
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:37,826
I’m no longer alone now the
love in my life is so near…

1085
01:21:39,286 --> 01:21:44,753
Find me now! Find me here!

1086
01:21:49,346 --> 01:21:50,906
Dear Cosette,

1087
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:53,633
You’re such a lonely child.

1088
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:58,075
How pensive, how sad you seem to me.

1089
01:21:59,027 --> 01:22:03,473
Believe me, were it within my power

1090
01:22:03,979 --> 01:22:07,002
I’d fill each passing hour.

1091
01:22:07,263 --> 01:22:11,611
How quiet it must be, I can see,

1092
01:22:12,086 --> 01:22:15,826
With only me for company.

1093
01:22:17,169 --> 01:22:19,830
There’s so little I know
That I’m longing to know

1094
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:23,346
Of the man that you were
In a time long ago…

1095
01:22:24,104 --> 01:22:26,648
There’s so little you say
Of the life you have known,

1096
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:30,139
Why you keep to yourself,
Why we’re always alone.

1097
01:22:30,662 --> 01:22:33,417
So dark! So dark and deep,

1098
01:22:34,045 --> 01:22:36,925
The secrets that you keep!

1099
01:22:39,161 --> 01:22:40,547
In my life

1100
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:46,702
Please forgive what I say
You are loving and gentle and good.

1101
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,441
But papa, dear papa,

1102
01:22:51,745 --> 01:22:55,774
In your eyes I am still like that child
Who was lost in a wood.

1103
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:57,976
No more words-

1104
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,365
No more words. It’s a time that is dead.

1105
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:03,912
There are words

1106
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,278
That are better unheard,
Better unsaid.

1107
01:23:08,571 --> 01:23:10,131
In my life

1108
01:23:10,716 --> 01:23:15,709
I’m no longer a child and I yearn
For the truth that you know

1109
01:23:17,332 --> 01:23:21,763
Of the years… Years ago!

1110
01:23:22,106 --> 01:23:23,666
You will learn.

1111
01:23:24,509 --> 01:23:29,725
Truth is given by God
To us all in our time, in our turn.

1112
01:23:39,956 --> 01:23:41,750
In my life

1113
01:23:42,265 --> 01:23:46,645
She has burst like the music of angels
The light of the sun!

1114
01:23:47,491 --> 01:23:49,926
And my life seems to stop

1115
01:23:49,969 --> 01:23:53,943
As if something is over
And something has scarcely begun!

1116
01:23:54,039 --> 01:23:57,864
Eponine, you’re the friend
Who has brought me here.

1117
01:23:57,895 --> 01:24:03,573
Thanks to you I am one with the Gods
And heaven is near!

1118
01:24:03,644 --> 01:24:07,479
And I soar through a world that is new,
That is free!

1119
01:24:07,798 --> 01:24:11,742
Every word that he says
Is a dagger in me!

1120
01:24:12,995 --> 01:24:14,195
In my life

1121
01:24:15,531 --> 01:24:18,747
There’s been no one like him anywhere,

1122
01:24:18,985 --> 01:24:21,521
Anywhere, where he is

1123
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:28,814
If he asked… I’d be his!

1124
01:24:29,572 --> 01:24:32,452
In my life

1125
01:24:33,124 --> 01:24:37,035
There is someone who touches my life-

1126
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,920
Waiting near!

1127
01:24:40,627 --> 01:24:43,610
Waiting here!

1128
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:56,585
A heart full of love!

1129
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:02,928
A heart full of song!

1130
01:25:02,966 --> 01:25:05,268
I’m doing everything all wrong-

1131
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:11,155
Oh God, for shame-
I do not even know your name.

1132
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:13,999
Dear Mad’moiselle,

1133
01:25:15,547 --> 01:25:17,359
Won’t you say?

1134
01:25:19,317 --> 01:25:20,674
Will you tell?

1135
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:25,252
A heart full of love!

1136
01:25:27,068 --> 01:25:30,643
No fear, no regret!

1137
01:25:31,003 --> 01:25:34,112
My name is Marius Pontmercy.

1138
01:25:34,404 --> 01:25:36,688
And mine’s Cosette.

1139
01:25:36,797 --> 01:25:40,026
Cosette… I don’t know what to say-

1140
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:42,630
Then make no sound.

1141
01:25:44,029 --> 01:25:45,878
I am lost-

1142
01:25:47,034 --> 01:25:48,315
I am found!

1143
01:25:48,316 --> 01:25:50,602
I am found!
– A heart full of light-

1144
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:52,431
– A heart full of light-

1145
01:25:52,432 --> 01:25:54,424
– He was never mine to lose
– A heart full of light-

1146
01:25:54,425 --> 01:25:55,930
– He was never mine to lose
– A heart full of you-

1147
01:25:55,931 --> 01:25:58,186
– A heart full of you-
– A heart full of you-

1148
01:25:58,187 --> 01:25:58,842
– Why regret what could not be?
– A heart full of you-

1149
01:25:58,843 --> 01:26:01,537
– Why regret what could not be?
– A single look and then I knew!

1150
01:26:01,843 --> 01:26:04,062
I knew it too!

1151
01:26:04,098 --> 01:26:07,135
These are words he’ll never say

1152
01:26:09,752 --> 01:26:11,114
Not to me,

1153
01:26:11,115 --> 01:26:12,929
– From today-

1154
01:26:12,984 --> 01:26:16,317
Not to me, not…

1155
01:26:16,347 --> 01:26:18,614
– .. for me.
– Every day…

1156
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:26,041
– His heart full of love…
– For it isn’t a dream-

1157
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:34,319
– Not a dream after all!
– He will never feel this way.

1158
01:26:38,181 --> 01:26:39,459
Cosette?

1159
01:26:42,975 --> 01:26:44,436
Cosette, what are you doing?

1160
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:46,398
I want you to stay inside.

1161
01:27:07,841 --> 01:27:09,870
Who is this hussy?

1162
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:13,044
It’s your brat Eponine!
Don’t you know your own kid?

1163
01:27:13,132 --> 01:27:15,661
Why’s she hanging about here?

1164
01:27:15,826 --> 01:27:18,823
Eponine, get on home!
You’re not needed in this.

1165
01:27:18,895 --> 01:27:21,760
We’re enough here without you.

1166
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:25,002
I know this house, I tell you!

1167
01:27:25,081 --> 01:27:28,046
There’s nothing here for you!

1168
01:27:28,295 --> 01:27:31,919
Just the old man and the girl.

1169
01:27:31,968 --> 01:27:35,708
They live ordinary lives.

1170
01:27:35,735 --> 01:27:37,570
Don’t interfere! You’ve got some gall!

1171
01:27:37,598 --> 01:27:40,163
Take care, young miss,
You’ve got a lot to say!

1172
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:42,567
I’m gonna scream!
I’m gonna warn them here!

1173
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:45,632
One little scream
and you’ll regret it for a year!

1174
01:27:47,552 --> 01:27:49,372
My God, Cosette!

1175
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:52,385
You wait, my girl!
You’ll rue this night!

1176
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:55,834
I’ll make you scream!
You’ll scream all right!

1177
01:27:57,842 --> 01:27:59,316
Police!

1178
01:28:00,925 --> 01:28:02,300
Must be Javert.

1179
01:28:02,813 --> 01:28:04,613
He’s found my cover at last.

1180
01:28:05,355 --> 01:28:06,946
I’ve got to get Cosette away

1181
01:28:07,022 --> 01:28:08,754
We'll go to the rear o'a pub
in the "rue de l'Homme Armé',

1182
01:28:08,769 --> 01:28:09,379
it safe there.

1183
01:28:09,434 --> 01:28:10,791
Then I'll arrange our passage to England.

1184
01:28:10,838 --> 01:28:11,517
No!

1185
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:13,517
Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave,
And say no more.

1186
01:28:13,549 --> 01:28:14,851
Tonight we’ll away!

1187
01:28:14,867 --> 01:28:16,848
– No! Please no! We can’t go!
– Hurry, Cosette!

1188
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:19,280
It’s time to close another door
And live another day!

1189
01:28:19,288 --> 01:28:20,369
Get dressed, we're leaving.

1190
01:28:20,408 --> 01:28:21,463
– Please, no-
– Now!

1191
01:28:55,131 --> 01:28:57,574
On my own

1192
01:28:58,307 --> 01:29:02,847
Pretending he’s beside me

1193
01:29:04,101 --> 01:29:06,536
All alone

1194
01:29:07,224 --> 01:29:11,434
I walk with him till morning

1195
01:29:13,193 --> 01:29:14,958
Without him

1196
01:29:16,221 --> 01:29:19,240
I feel his arms around me

1197
01:29:19,782 --> 01:29:24,006
And when I lose my way I close my eyes

1198
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:27,658
And he has found me.

1199
01:29:30,143 --> 01:29:33,283
In the rain

1200
01:29:33,992 --> 01:29:38,669
The pavement shines like silver

1201
01:29:39,764 --> 01:29:41,766
All the lights

1202
01:29:42,198 --> 01:29:45,417
Are misty in the river

1203
01:29:47,128 --> 01:29:53,750
In the darkness the trees
are full of starlight

1204
01:29:54,009 --> 01:29:59,544
And all I see is him and me
forever and forever!

1205
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:10,979
And I know it’s only in my mind-

1206
01:30:11,347 --> 01:30:17,920
That I’m talking to myself and not to him.

1207
01:30:18,342 --> 01:30:25,702
And although I know that he is blind,

1208
01:30:25,897 --> 01:30:32,191
Still I say there’s a way for us.

1209
01:30:33,471 --> 01:30:38,976
I love him But when the night is over

1210
01:30:40,486 --> 01:30:46,015
He is gone- the river’s just a river.

1211
01:30:47,499 --> 01:30:52,395
Without him the world around me changes-

1212
01:30:52,442 --> 01:30:58,307
The trees are bare and everywhere
The streets are full of strangers.

1213
01:30:58,354 --> 01:31:05,429
I love him
But every day I’m learning

1214
01:31:05,484 --> 01:31:12,953
All my life I’ve only been pretending.

1215
01:31:13,045 --> 01:31:18,403
Without me, his world will go on turning

1216
01:31:18,504 --> 01:31:21,165
A world that’s full of happiness

1217
01:31:21,296 --> 01:31:28,739
That I have never known.

1218
01:31:32,647 --> 01:31:34,553
I love him

1219
01:31:39,459 --> 01:31:40,920
I love him

1220
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:48,737
I love him

1221
01:31:51,175 --> 01:31:59,163
But only on my own.

1222
01:32:11,968 --> 01:32:14,804
One day more!

1223
01:32:14,975 --> 01:32:18,219
Another day, another destiny.

1224
01:32:18,423 --> 01:32:21,368
This never-ending road to Calvary.

1225
01:32:23,211 --> 01:32:26,904
These men who seem to know my crime
Will surely come a second time-

1226
01:32:27,059 --> 01:32:32,127
– One day more!
– I did not live until today-

1227
01:32:34,518 --> 01:32:38,187
How can I live when we are parted?

1228
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:45,819
– One day more!
– Tomorrow you’ll be worlds away

1229
01:32:47,742 --> 01:32:52,390
And yet with you my world has started!

1230
01:32:54,546 --> 01:32:57,442
One more day all on my own…

1231
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:00,935
Will we ever meet again?

1232
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:04,206
One more day with him not caring…

1233
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:07,011
I was born to be with you!

1234
01:33:07,075 --> 01:33:10,268
What a life I might have known…

1235
01:33:10,296 --> 01:33:14,229
And I swear I will be true!

1236
01:33:14,251 --> 01:33:22,251
But he never saw me there.

1237
01:33:22,674 --> 01:33:25,859
One more day before the storm!

1238
01:33:25,867 --> 01:33:28,265
Do I follow where she goes?

1239
01:33:28,308 --> 01:33:31,227
At the barricades of freedom!

1240
01:33:31,254 --> 01:33:34,048
Shall I join my brothers there?

1241
01:33:34,076 --> 01:33:36,806
When our ranks begin to form-

1242
01:33:36,835 --> 01:33:39,612
Do I stay and do I dare?

1243
01:33:39,668 --> 01:33:43,243
Will you take your place with me?

1244
01:33:43,277 --> 01:33:45,775
The time is now!

1245
01:33:45,807 --> 01:33:49,673
The day is here!

1246
01:33:49,742 --> 01:33:51,380
One day more!

1247
01:33:51,411 --> 01:33:54,153
One day more to revolution.

1248
01:33:54,209 --> 01:33:56,739
We will nip it in the bud.

1249
01:33:56,782 --> 01:33:59,714
We’ll be ready for these schoolboys.

1250
01:33:59,777 --> 01:34:01,131
They will wet themselves with blood!

1251
01:34:01,154 --> 01:34:02,511
They will wet themselves with blood!
– One day more!

1252
01:34:02,537 --> 01:34:03,727
Watch’em run amuck!

1253
01:34:03,751 --> 01:34:05,149
Catch’em as they fall!

1254
01:34:05,193 --> 01:34:07,925
Never know your luck
When there’s a free-for-all.

1255
01:34:08,038 --> 01:34:09,331
Here a little dip,

1256
01:34:09,386 --> 01:34:10,706
There a little touch-

1257
01:34:10,742 --> 01:34:13,607
Most of them are goners
So they won’t miss much!

1258
01:34:13,651 --> 01:34:16,607
One day to a new beginning!

1259
01:34:16,637 --> 01:34:19,026
Raise the flag of freedom high!

1260
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,526
Every man will be a king!

1261
01:34:21,579 --> 01:34:24,596
Every man will be a king!

1262
01:34:24,613 --> 01:34:27,991
There’s a new world for the winning!

1263
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:30,467
There’s a new world to be won!

1264
01:34:30,516 --> 01:34:33,603
Do you hear the people sing?

1265
01:34:33,652 --> 01:34:36,087
My place is here!

1266
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:40,197
I fight with you!

1267
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:42,460
One day more!

1268
01:34:42,461 --> 01:34:45,125
– We will join these people’s heroes
– I did not live until today

1269
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:47,851
– We will follow where they go.
– One more day on my own…

1270
01:34:47,925 --> 01:34:50,699
We will learn their little secrets,
– How can I live when we are parted?

1271
01:34:50,725 --> 01:34:52,465
We will know the things they know.

1272
01:34:52,466 --> 01:34:53,785
We will know the things they know.
– One day more!

1273
01:34:53,786 --> 01:34:56,393
One more day to revolution
– One day more!

1274
01:34:56,417 --> 01:34:59,200
We will nip it in the bud
– One more day on my own…

1275
01:34:59,217 --> 01:35:01,628
We’ll be ready for these schoolboys-

1276
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:03,027
We’ll be ready for these schoolboys-
– Tomorrow we’ll be far away.

1277
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:05,149
Tomorrow is the judgement day.

1278
01:35:05,185 --> 01:35:11,800
Tomorrow we’ll discover
What our God in heaven has in store-

1279
01:35:11,855 --> 01:35:14,915
One more dawn!

1280
01:35:15,023 --> 01:35:18,204
One more day!

1281
01:35:18,228 --> 01:35:26,228
One day more!

1282
01:35:50,232 --> 01:35:53,417
Do you hear the people sing

1283
01:35:53,454 --> 01:35:56,659
Singing the song of angry men?

1284
01:35:56,738 --> 01:35:59,938
It is the music of a people

1285
01:35:59,967 --> 01:36:03,103
Who will not be slaves again!

1286
01:36:03,306 --> 01:36:06,525
When the beating of your heart

1287
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:09,721
Echoes the beating of the drums

1288
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:12,323
There is a life about to start

1289
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:16,096
When tomorrow comes!

1290
01:36:16,136 --> 01:36:19,090
Will you join in our crusade?

1291
01:36:19,137 --> 01:36:23,074
Who will be strong and stand with me?

1292
01:36:23,162 --> 01:36:25,120
Beyond the barricade

1293
01:36:25,144 --> 01:36:28,962
Is there a world you long to see?

1294
01:36:29,046 --> 01:36:32,379
Then join in the fight
That will give you the right

1295
01:36:32,419 --> 01:36:34,895
To be free!

1296
01:36:34,947 --> 01:36:38,154
Do you hear the people sing

1297
01:36:38,214 --> 01:36:41,240
Singing the song of angry men?

1298
01:36:41,288 --> 01:36:44,215
It is the music of a people

1299
01:36:44,244 --> 01:36:47,402
Who will not be slaves again!

1300
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:50,325
When the beating of your heart

1301
01:36:50,367 --> 01:36:52,981
Echoes the beating of the drums

1302
01:36:53,019 --> 01:36:55,993
There is a life about to start

1303
01:36:56,016 --> 01:36:59,623
When tomorrow comes!

1304
01:36:59,744 --> 01:37:02,469
Will you give all you can give

1305
01:37:02,482 --> 01:37:06,157
So that our banner may advance?

1306
01:37:06,227 --> 01:37:08,627
Some will fall and some will live

1307
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:12,525
Will you stand up and take your chance?

1308
01:37:12,676 --> 01:37:18,049
The blood of the martyrs
Will water the meadows of France!

1309
01:37:18,156 --> 01:37:20,927
Do you hear the people sing

1310
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:23,739
Singing the song of angry men?

1311
01:37:23,769 --> 01:37:26,829
It is the music of a people

1312
01:37:26,866 --> 01:37:29,337
Who will not be slaves again!

1313
01:37:29,378 --> 01:37:32,836
When the beating of your heart

1314
01:37:32,865 --> 01:37:35,375
Echoes the beating of the drums

1315
01:37:35,415 --> 01:37:38,362
There is a life about to start

1316
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:43,345
When tomorrow comes!

1317
01:37:50,276 --> 01:37:51,632
Draw!

1318
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,365
No more, no! No!

1319
01:37:59,396 --> 01:38:01,831
– Shoot on anything but women!
– Murderer!

1320
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:10,070
Watch it to the right!

1321
01:38:13,756 --> 01:38:14,876
Sir!

1322
01:38:16,369 --> 01:38:18,469
Thank you Sir!
Than you Monsieur!

1323
01:38:18,679 --> 01:38:21,702
– To the barricades!
– Vive la France!

1324
01:38:25,852 --> 01:38:28,250
We build the barricades!
– Come on!

1325
01:38:33,411 --> 01:38:35,231
Get down! Get down!

1326
01:38:43,543 --> 01:38:46,143
Grantaire, get off your ass, it's begun!

1327
01:38:46,643 --> 01:38:47,914
Barricades!

1328
01:38:47,945 --> 01:38:49,312
Sorry M'dame, thank you.

1329
01:38:54,316 --> 01:38:57,393
We need as much furniture
as you can draw down!

1330
01:38:57,432 --> 01:38:59,250
Draw everything you have!

1331
01:39:06,242 --> 01:39:07,727
Wait! Below!

1332
01:39:09,563 --> 01:39:11,344
What is that, what is that?!

1333
01:39:19,415 --> 01:39:20,535
No!

1334
01:39:23,598 --> 01:39:24,598
Thank you Madame!

1335
01:39:24,645 --> 01:39:26,106
I need a volunteer!

1336
01:39:26,153 --> 01:39:28,799
Someone who can find out their plan,
and when they will attack!

1337
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:30,638
I can find out the truth!

1338
01:39:30,926 --> 01:39:32,742
I know their ways,

1339
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:35,023
Fought their wars,

1340
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:37,215
Served my time

1341
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:39,497
In the days

1342
01:39:39,955 --> 01:39:41,708
Of my youth.

1343
01:39:41,771 --> 01:39:43,571
See! The people unite!

1344
01:39:44,246 --> 01:39:46,046
I pray your right

1345
01:39:46,523 --> 01:39:48,323
Dogs will bark!

1346
01:39:48,385 --> 01:39:50,185
Fleas will bite!

1347
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,851
They will do what is right.

1348
01:40:01,614 --> 01:40:05,807
Red, the blood of angry men!

1349
01:40:05,889 --> 01:40:09,571
Black, the dark of ages past!

1350
01:40:09,726 --> 01:40:13,938
Red, a world about to dawn!

1351
01:40:13,966 --> 01:40:21,495
Black, the night that ends at last!

1352
01:40:23,834 --> 01:40:24,896
He's back!

1353
01:40:26,951 --> 01:40:29,409
Listen, my friends,
I have done as I said.

1354
01:40:29,457 --> 01:40:32,026
I have been to their lines,
I have counted each man.

1355
01:40:32,074 --> 01:40:34,550
I will tell what I can.

1356
01:40:35,564 --> 01:40:38,061
Better be warned
They have armies to spare

1357
01:40:38,093 --> 01:40:41,038
And our danger is real-
We will need all our cunning

1358
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:42,801
To bring them to heel.

1359
01:40:42,872 --> 01:40:44,481
Have faith!

1360
01:40:44,861 --> 01:40:48,241
If you know what their movements are
We’ll spoil their game.

1361
01:40:48,337 --> 01:40:51,226
There are ways that a people can fight-

1362
01:40:51,265 --> 01:40:55,921
We shall overcome their power!

1363
01:40:56,202 --> 01:40:58,602
I have overheard their plans.

1364
01:40:59,281 --> 01:41:01,468
There will be no attack tonight.

1365
01:41:01,855 --> 01:41:03,812
They intend to starve you out

1366
01:41:03,897 --> 01:41:06,132
Before they start a proper fight-

1367
01:41:06,658 --> 01:41:08,570
Concentrate their force,

1368
01:41:08,928 --> 01:41:11,246
Hit us when it’s light-

1369
01:41:11,316 --> 01:41:12,285
Liar!

1370
01:41:13,247 --> 01:41:17,385
Good evening, dear Inspector.
Lovely evening, my dear!

1371
01:41:17,535 --> 01:41:21,220
I know this man, my friends.
His name’s Inspector Javert!

1372
01:41:21,369 --> 01:41:25,218
So don’t believe a word he says
Cause none of it’s true.

1373
01:41:25,429 --> 01:41:29,090
This only goes to show
What little people can do.

1374
01:41:29,273 --> 01:41:31,638
Bravo, little Gavroche!
You’re the top of the class!

1375
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:34,893
So what are we gonna do
With this snake in the grass?

1376
01:41:34,954 --> 01:41:37,542
Take this man and throw him
In the tavern in there!

1377
01:41:37,572 --> 01:41:40,985
The people will decide your fate,
Inspector Javert!

1378
01:41:41,042 --> 01:41:43,953
Shoot me now or shoot me later-

1379
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:46,507
Every schoolboy to his sport!

1380
01:41:46,659 --> 01:41:49,250
Death to each and every traitor!

1381
01:41:49,451 --> 01:41:51,882
I renounce your people’s court!

1382
01:41:52,087 --> 01:41:53,487
We keep looking forward!

1383
01:42:18,683 --> 01:42:19,803
Come in!

1384
01:42:20,859 --> 01:42:22,944
To your positions!
To your positions!

1385
01:42:24,154 --> 01:42:25,559
They're coming.

1386
01:42:29,098 --> 01:42:31,325
By the right! Right!

1387
01:42:33,153 --> 01:42:34,770
Now hold your fire!

1388
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:36,752
Right.
Front rank, heel!

1389
01:42:36,846 --> 01:42:39,033
– Save your gunpowder.
– Take aim!

1390
01:42:41,099 --> 01:42:43,499
Who’s there?

1391
01:42:46,053 --> 01:42:47,613
French Revolution!

1392
01:42:48,196 --> 01:42:49,902
Fire!

1393
01:42:53,313 --> 01:42:55,133
They're coming!

1394
01:42:57,584 --> 01:42:59,398
Carry on to the barricade!

1395
01:42:59,468 --> 01:43:00,868
Get back!

1396
01:43:14,969 --> 01:43:16,748
Marius, don't!

1397
01:43:18,414 --> 01:43:20,177
Marius, what're you doing?

1398
01:43:20,231 --> 01:43:23,408
– Get down!
– Marius, watch out! Get down!

1399
01:43:23,893 --> 01:43:25,502
No!

1400
01:43:28,886 --> 01:43:30,286
Full back!

1401
01:43:30,589 --> 01:43:32,683
Full back, or I'll blow the barricade!

1402
01:43:32,769 --> 01:43:34,860
Blow it up and take yourself with it!

1403
01:43:35,719 --> 01:43:36,839
Christ!

1404
01:43:39,904 --> 01:43:41,552
And myself with it.

1405
01:43:43,966 --> 01:43:46,206
Back! Back!

1406
01:43:53,915 --> 01:43:56,494
What were you thinking, Marius,
you could have yourself killed!

1407
01:43:56,541 --> 01:43:57,991
Marius, you saved us all!

1408
01:43:59,287 --> 01:44:00,835
Eponine! What were you doing?

1409
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:02,148
I kept it from you…

1410
01:44:03,255 --> 01:44:04,614
It's from Cosette…

1411
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:08,420
I'm sorry.

1412
01:44:10,872 --> 01:44:12,247
What have you done?

1413
01:44:18,143 --> 01:44:19,251
You're hurt!

1414
01:44:21,726 --> 01:44:23,646
Don’t you fret,

1415
01:44:24,779 --> 01:44:27,747
M’sieur Marius-

1416
01:44:29,434 --> 01:44:33,676
I don’t feel any pain.

1417
01:44:34,778 --> 01:44:39,205
A little fall of rain

1418
01:44:40,151 --> 01:44:44,758
Can hardly hurt me now.

1419
01:44:46,633 --> 01:44:53,509
You’re here- that’s all I need to know

1420
01:44:55,596 --> 01:44:59,400
And you will keep me safe

1421
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:03,693
And you will keep me close

1422
01:45:05,005 --> 01:45:11,144
And rain will make the flowers grow…

1423
01:45:12,253 --> 01:45:17,364
But you will live, Eponine –
Dear God above!

1424
01:45:17,997 --> 01:45:22,447
If I could close your wounds
with words of love-

1425
01:45:23,768 --> 01:45:27,790
Just hold me now, and let it be.

1426
01:45:28,322 --> 01:45:32,603
Shelter me… Comfort me…

1427
01:45:32,951 --> 01:45:35,519
– What should be done,
– So don’t you fret,

1428
01:45:35,558 --> 01:45:37,878
– dear Eponine,
– M’sieur Marius

1429
01:45:38,301 --> 01:45:41,728
– I don’t feel any pain
– You won’t feel any pain

1430
01:45:43,001 --> 01:45:46,498
– A little fall of rain
– A little fall of rain

1431
01:45:47,397 --> 01:45:50,903
– Can hardly hurt me now…
– Can hardly hurt you now…

1432
01:45:52,148 --> 01:45:53,268
I'm here.

1433
01:45:54,916 --> 01:45:58,710
That’s all I need to know

1434
01:46:00,547 --> 01:46:04,076
– And you will keep me safe
– I will stay with you

1435
01:46:04,682 --> 01:46:10,336
Till you are sleeping.
– And you will keep me close

1436
01:46:11,547 --> 01:46:15,185
And rain..
– And rain..

1437
01:46:15,449 --> 01:46:20,462
– Will make the flowers…
– Will make the flowers…

1438
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,777
Grow…

1439
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:28,520
They were the first to fall.

1440
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,920
The first to fall upon this barricade.

1441
01:46:56,213 --> 01:46:59,085
Gavroche.
Will you do something for me?

1442
01:46:59,474 --> 01:47:02,706
Anything.
Without you, I would have been dust.

1443
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:08,730
Letter from the barricade..

1444
01:47:08,787 --> 01:47:11,099
From the barricade?
I'll take it.

1445
01:47:13,845 --> 01:47:17,400
Something for me, something for you.
Who needs charity?

1446
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:18,684
Boy!

1447
01:47:20,588 --> 01:47:22,148
You stay with me, you understand?

1448
01:47:28,449 --> 01:47:29,569
"Dearest Cosette,

1449
01:47:30,434 --> 01:47:33,425
You have entered my soul
And soon you will be gone.

1450
01:47:34,761 --> 01:47:38,680
Can it be only a day since we met
And the world was reborn?

1451
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:44,171
If I should fall in the battle to come
Let this be my goodbye.

1452
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,420
Now that I know you love…

1453
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:51,177
love me as well

1454
01:47:51,728 --> 01:47:54,098
It is harder to die.

1455
01:47:54,803 --> 01:47:58,499
I pray that God will bring me home
To be with you.

1456
01:47:59,054 --> 01:48:01,066
Pray for your Marius.

1457
01:48:02,043 --> 01:48:04,759
He prays for you."

1458
01:48:10,001 --> 01:48:14,759
This is the day the most I feared, now a
young man has appeared to change my life.

1459
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:21,543
This Marius will take away the treasure
of my olden days to be his wife.

1460
01:48:22,389 --> 01:48:25,108
But he could die tonight.

1461
01:48:29,928 --> 01:48:33,024
I must find this boy.

1462
01:48:48,135 --> 01:48:49,695
Don’t shoot! Don't shoot!

1463
01:48:50,655 --> 01:48:52,785
I come here as a volunteer.

1464
01:48:55,551 --> 01:48:56,671
Let's see.

1465
01:48:59,173 --> 01:49:02,868
You see that prisoner over there?
A volunteer like you!

1466
01:49:03,052 --> 01:49:06,487
A spy who calls himself Javert!
He’s going to get it too!

1467
01:49:06,627 --> 01:49:09,573
Get in there. Get inside!
– Don't kill him ! I know him!

1468
01:49:10,859 --> 01:49:13,031
Enemy! Marius run!
– On the roof! On the roof!

1469
01:49:15,615 --> 01:49:17,015
On the roof!

1470
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:19,376
Get them!
Where are they?

1471
01:49:19,455 --> 01:49:20,095
Alright?

1472
01:49:20,126 --> 01:49:22,274
Take the left.
I'll take on the right.

1473
01:49:22,384 --> 01:49:23,608
The eye for it!

1474
01:49:23,874 --> 01:49:25,974
Eye to the roof!
Eye to the roof!

1475
01:49:26,265 --> 01:49:27,522
Thank you Monsieur.

1476
01:49:28,092 --> 01:49:31,574
Give me no thanks, M’sieur.
There’s something you can do.

1477
01:49:31,846 --> 01:49:33,646
If it is in my power.

1478
01:49:34,269 --> 01:49:38,284
Give me the spy Javert!
Let me take care of him.

1479
01:49:41,503 --> 01:49:45,463
Do what you have to do-
The man belongs to you.

1480
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:47,791
No!

1481
01:50:16,507 --> 01:50:17,801
We meet again…

1482
01:50:17,987 --> 01:50:21,574
You’ve hungered for this all your life.

1483
01:50:22,097 --> 01:50:24,051
Take your revenge.

1484
01:50:24,814 --> 01:50:28,785
How right you should kill with a knife.

1485
01:50:31,249 --> 01:50:33,069
Get out of here.

1486
01:50:33,173 --> 01:50:34,575
Don’t understand…

1487
01:50:34,636 --> 01:50:37,379
Clear out of here.

1488
01:50:41,866 --> 01:50:45,607
Once a thief, forever a thief.

1489
01:50:46,358 --> 01:50:49,717
What you want, you always steal.

1490
01:50:50,019 --> 01:50:53,037
You would trade your life for mine.

1491
01:50:53,288 --> 01:50:56,488
Yes, Valjean, you want a deal!

1492
01:50:56,634 --> 01:50:58,988
Shoot me now for all I care-

1493
01:50:59,028 --> 01:51:01,264
If you let me go, beware!

1494
01:51:01,344 --> 01:51:04,209
You’ll still answer to Javert!

1495
01:51:07,631 --> 01:51:12,935
You are wrong, and always have been wrong.

1496
01:51:14,647 --> 01:51:18,535
I’m a man no worse than any man.

1497
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:24,415
You are free, and there are no conditions-

1498
01:51:25,166 --> 01:51:27,782
No bargains or petitions.

1499
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:32,071
There’s nothing that I blame you for.

1500
01:51:33,428 --> 01:51:37,860
You’ve done your duty, nothing more.

1501
01:51:40,136 --> 01:51:41,814
Ιf Ι соmе оut оf thіѕ аlіvе,

1502
01:51:42,697 --> 01:51:45,868
You will find me rue de l'Homme Armé n°5.

1503
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:51,860
No doubt our paths will cross again.

1504
01:52:21,164 --> 01:52:23,709
Courfeyrac, you take the watch-

1505
01:52:24,392 --> 01:52:26,849
They may attack before it’s light.

1506
01:52:27,356 --> 01:52:29,921
Everybody keep the faith,

1507
01:52:31,032 --> 01:52:33,476
For certain as our banner flies,

1508
01:52:33,503 --> 01:52:35,633
We are not alone-

1509
01:52:35,767 --> 01:52:39,539
The people too must rise!

1510
01:52:41,126 --> 01:52:44,640
Marius, rest.

1511
01:52:49,794 --> 01:52:57,630
Drink with me to days gone by!

1512
01:52:57,695 --> 01:53:05,192
To the life that used to be!

1513
01:53:05,254 --> 01:53:10,299
At the shrine of friendship
Never say die…

1514
01:53:10,349 --> 01:53:15,686
Let the wine of friendship
Never run dry!

1515
01:53:15,802 --> 01:53:18,147
Here’s to you
– Here’s to you

1516
01:53:18,681 --> 01:53:23,592
And here’s to me!

1517
01:53:25,141 --> 01:53:27,489
Do I care if I should die

1518
01:53:27,747 --> 01:53:30,763
Now she goes across the sea?

1519
01:53:30,851 --> 01:53:36,357
Life without Cosette
Means nothing at all…

1520
01:53:36,431 --> 01:53:41,530
Don’t you weep, Cosette, if I was to fall.

1521
01:53:41,994 --> 01:53:43,554
Will you weep, Cosette,

1522
01:53:47,722 --> 01:53:52,526
For me?

1523
01:54:05,014 --> 01:54:11,636
God on high

1524
01:54:12,254 --> 01:54:17,607
Hear my prayer

1525
01:54:18,779 --> 01:54:24,206
In my need

1526
01:54:24,612 --> 01:54:30,953
You have always been there.

1527
01:54:32,415 --> 01:54:38,758
He is young

1528
01:54:39,202 --> 01:54:44,689
He’s afraid

1529
01:54:45,072 --> 01:54:50,281
Let him rest

1530
01:54:50,305 --> 01:54:56,028
Heaven blessed.

1531
01:54:56,129 --> 01:55:01,845
Bring him home

1532
01:55:01,955 --> 01:55:07,085
Bring him home

1533
01:55:09,203 --> 01:55:11,315
Bring him home!

1534
01:55:14,433 --> 01:55:17,323
He’s like the son I might have known

1535
01:55:19,519 --> 01:55:22,403
If God had granted me a son.

1536
01:55:23,661 --> 01:55:28,533
The summers die one by one

1537
01:55:28,608 --> 01:55:34,478
How soon they fly on and on

1538
01:55:34,845 --> 01:55:38,592
And I am old

1539
01:55:39,568 --> 01:55:43,426
And will be gone.

1540
01:55:46,114 --> 01:55:53,336
Bring him peace

1541
01:55:53,541 --> 01:55:59,101
Bring him joy

1542
01:56:00,086 --> 01:56:04,287
He is young

1543
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:09,402
He is only a boy.

1544
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:18,502
You can take

1545
01:56:18,565 --> 01:56:23,094
You can give

1546
01:56:24,664 --> 01:56:28,523
Let him be

1547
01:56:28,671 --> 01:56:33,348
Let him live,

1548
01:56:33,981 --> 01:56:38,503
If I die,

1549
01:56:38,597 --> 01:56:44,563
let me die

1550
01:56:46,657 --> 01:56:50,960
Let him live

1551
01:56:53,038 --> 01:56:58,426
Bring him home

1552
01:57:00,145 --> 01:57:04,184
Bring him home

1553
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:12,041
Bring him…

1554
01:57:12,135 --> 01:57:20,135
home!

1555
01:57:32,963 --> 01:57:35,571
I was right.
The rain's damaged the gunpowder.

1556
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:38,271
We're low on ammunition.
– We're the only barricade left.

1557
01:57:38,936 --> 01:57:40,381
What?

1558
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:42,482
We're the only ones left.

1559
01:57:46,437 --> 01:57:49,302
The people have not stirred.

1560
01:57:49,549 --> 01:57:52,890
We're abandoned by those
Who still live in fear.

1561
01:57:53,625 --> 01:57:55,351
But let's not waste lives!

1562
01:57:55,794 --> 01:57:57,568
Let all who wish to

1563
01:57:58,745 --> 01:58:00,357
Go from here!

1564
01:58:07,934 --> 01:58:10,697
Do you hear the people sing

1565
01:58:10,771 --> 01:58:13,736
Singing the song of angry men

1566
01:58:13,846 --> 01:58:16,559
It is the music of the people

1567
01:58:16,596 --> 01:58:19,809
Who will not be slaves again

1568
01:58:19,897 --> 01:58:22,856
When the beating of your heart

1569
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:25,434
Echoes the beating of the drums

1570
01:58:25,872 --> 01:58:28,059
There is a life about to start

1571
01:58:28,078 --> 01:58:30,833
When tomorrow comes!

1572
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:34,445
Enjolras! We need more ammunitions.

1573
01:58:34,487 --> 01:58:35,711
I'm going to the colonnade.

1574
01:58:35,742 --> 01:58:37,234
There are dead bodies there,
dry ammunition.

1575
01:58:37,258 --> 01:58:38,242
The gunpowder's wet through.

1576
01:58:38,278 --> 01:58:39,028
Look, let's run it up.

1577
01:58:39,061 --> 01:58:40,552
Let's get everything out there.
Just get everything.

1578
01:58:40,576 --> 01:58:45,448
Little people know
When little peoples fight

1579
01:58:46,288 --> 01:58:49,035
We may look easy pickings

1580
01:58:50,173 --> 01:58:53,202
– Gavroche!
– But we’ve got some bite!

1581
01:58:53,287 --> 01:58:54,582
Gavroche, come!

1582
01:58:54,625 --> 01:58:57,142
So never kick a dog

1583
01:58:57,418 --> 01:58:59,462
Because he’s just a pup-

1584
01:59:03,867 --> 01:59:06,921
– Gavroche!
– We’ll fight like twenty armies

1585
01:59:07,539 --> 01:59:10,568
And we won’t give up!

1586
01:59:11,342 --> 01:59:13,292
Gavroche!
Gavroche, what you're doing?

1587
01:59:18,326 --> 01:59:21,899
So you’d better run for cover

1588
01:59:22,468 --> 01:59:26,954
When the pup grows-

1589
01:59:46,702 --> 01:59:49,153
You at the barricades listen to this!

1590
01:59:50,921 --> 01:59:53,321
The people of Paris sleep in their beds!

1591
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,631
You have no chance,

1592
01:59:57,295 --> 01:59:59,584
No chance at all!

1593
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:04,813
Why throw your lives away?

1594
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:13,144
Let us die facing our foes!

1595
02:00:13,817 --> 02:00:16,611
Make them bleed while we can!

1596
02:00:16,672 --> 02:00:18,338
Make’em pay through the nose!

1597
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:19,939
Make’em pay for every man!

1598
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:25,351
Let others rise to take our place

1599
02:00:25,414 --> 02:00:32,614
Until the earth is free!

1600
02:00:33,231 --> 02:00:35,096
Canons!

1601
02:00:35,643 --> 02:00:39,054
Put out your guns, come on!

1602
02:00:39,336 --> 02:00:41,654
Forward first!
– Wait for it! Wait for it!

1603
02:00:41,826 --> 02:00:42,943
Fire!

1604
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:47,480
Marius!

1605
02:00:48,545 --> 02:00:50,097
There, they're bringing another for us!

1606
02:00:50,152 --> 02:00:52,238
Second canon, fire!

1607
02:00:54,449 --> 02:00:55,956
Fire!

1608
02:00:56,912 --> 02:00:59,092
Take aim!
Fire!

1609
02:00:59,123 --> 02:01:00,373
Take cover, boy!

1610
02:01:02,772 --> 02:01:05,894
There's more men!
There's more men, Enjolras!

1611
02:01:06,707 --> 02:01:09,306
– Canon's ready!
– Fire!

1612
02:01:17,305 --> 02:01:18,967
– Canon's ready!

1613
02:01:19,419 --> 02:01:21,763
And fire!

1614
02:01:29,795 --> 02:01:31,195
Advance!

1615
02:01:32,027 --> 02:01:33,427
Watch out!

1616
02:01:46,002 --> 02:01:48,593
Please, please!
Please!

1617
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:51,060
Open the door please!

1618
02:01:51,248 --> 02:01:52,443
Please!

1619
02:01:54,028 --> 02:01:56,447
We need a door,
we need to barricade the door!

1620
02:02:00,314 --> 02:02:02,378
Marius! Marius!

1621
02:04:44,346 --> 02:04:46,173
Long live the Revolution!

1622
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,700
Here's a pretty ring.

1623
02:04:52,782 --> 02:04:54,582
Oh! I like!

1624
02:04:58,919 --> 02:05:01,393
You're alive!
I saved you!

1625
02:05:08,538 --> 02:05:10,537
How do I get out of here?
– It's down way!

1626
02:05:10,605 --> 02:05:12,673
All the way down and to the left!

1627
02:05:54,941 --> 02:05:57,698
It’s you, Javert!
I knew you wouldn’t wait too long.

1628
02:05:58,261 --> 02:06:00,661
The faithful servant
at his post once more.

1629
02:06:01,153 --> 02:06:02,641
This man’s done no wrong.

1630
02:06:02,765 --> 02:06:04,669
He needs a doctor’s care.

1631
02:06:05,752 --> 02:06:07,864
I warned you I would not give in!

1632
02:06:08,349 --> 02:06:11,151
I won’t be swayed!
– Another hour yet

1633
02:06:11,677 --> 02:06:13,237
And then I’m yours

1634
02:06:13,361 --> 02:06:16,507
All our debts are paid.

1635
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:20,268
The man of mercy comes again

1636
02:06:20,437 --> 02:06:24,020
And talks of justice!
– Come, time is running short-

1637
02:06:24,756 --> 02:06:27,388
Look down, Javert!

1638
02:06:28,136 --> 02:06:32,548
He’s standing in his grave!

1639
02:06:46,707 --> 02:06:48,759
One more step and you die.

1640
02:07:18,735 --> 02:07:20,943
Who is this man?
What sort of devil is he?

1641
02:07:20,967 --> 02:07:23,912
To have caught me in a trap
And choose to let me go free?

1642
02:07:23,936 --> 02:07:26,727
It was his hour at last
To put a seal on my fate

1643
02:07:26,907 --> 02:07:29,391
Wipe out the past
And wash me clean off the slate!

1644
02:07:29,617 --> 02:07:32,251
All it would take Was
a flick of his knife

1645
02:07:32,368 --> 02:07:36,453
Vengeance was his
And he gave me back my life!

1646
02:07:38,187 --> 02:07:40,508
Damned if I live in the debt of a thief!

1647
02:07:40,688 --> 02:07:42,943
Damned if I yield at the end of the chase!

1648
02:07:43,143 --> 02:07:45,685
I am the law and the law is not mocked!

1649
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:47,988
I’ll spit his pity right back in his face!

1650
02:07:48,031 --> 02:07:50,426
There is nothing on earth that we share!

1651
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:53,113
It is either Valjean or Javert!

1652
02:08:00,212 --> 02:08:03,038
And my thoughts fly apart

1653
02:08:04,302 --> 02:08:07,030
Can this man be believed?

1654
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:11,486
Shall his sins be forgiven?

1655
02:08:12,861 --> 02:08:20,861
Shall his crimes be reprieved?

1656
02:08:22,849 --> 02:08:26,120
And must I now begin to doubt

1657
02:08:27,486 --> 02:08:31,054
Who never doubted all those years?

1658
02:08:32,427 --> 02:08:35,590
My heart is stone and still it trembles…

1659
02:08:36,454 --> 02:08:41,623
The world I have known is lost in shadow

1660
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:46,378
Is he from heaven or from hell?

1661
02:08:47,175 --> 02:08:51,050
And does he know

1662
02:08:51,183 --> 02:08:54,813
That granting me my life today

1663
02:09:00,853 --> 02:09:07,411
This man has killed me even so?

1664
02:09:12,209 --> 02:09:17,031
I am reaching but I fall

1665
02:09:17,679 --> 02:09:22,161
And the stars are black and cold

1666
02:09:22,747 --> 02:09:25,963
As I stare into the void

1667
02:09:26,589 --> 02:09:29,783
Of a world that cannot hold…

1668
02:09:29,846 --> 02:09:32,578
I’ll escape now from that world

1669
02:09:32,693 --> 02:09:35,651
From the world of Jean Valjean

1670
02:09:35,675 --> 02:09:38,667
There is nowhere I can turn…

1671
02:09:38,921 --> 02:09:45,559
There is no way to go on…

1672
02:10:14,426 --> 02:10:19,089
Did you see them
Going off to fight?

1673
02:10:19,238 --> 02:10:23,962
Children of the barricade
Who didn’t last the night.

1674
02:10:24,057 --> 02:10:28,459
Did you see them
Lying where they died?

1675
02:10:28,566 --> 02:10:33,166
Someone used to cradle them And
kiss them when they cried.

1676
02:10:33,647 --> 02:10:39,202
Did you see them lying side by side?

1677
02:10:47,837 --> 02:10:50,979
There’s a grief that can’t be spoken

1678
02:10:54,768 --> 02:10:58,138
There’s a pain goes on and on

1679
02:11:00,766 --> 02:11:04,086
Empty chairs at empty tables

1680
02:11:05,672 --> 02:11:12,068
Now my friends are dead and gone.

1681
02:11:14,787 --> 02:11:18,896
Here they talked of revolution

1682
02:11:20,857 --> 02:11:24,736
Here it was they lit the flame

1683
02:11:26,635 --> 02:11:30,005
Here they sang about tomorrow

1684
02:11:31,559 --> 02:11:38,689
And tomorrow never came…

1685
02:11:41,009 --> 02:11:45,860
From the table in the corner

1686
02:11:46,555 --> 02:11:50,804
They could see a world reborn

1687
02:11:51,906 --> 02:11:56,427
And they rose with voices ringing

1688
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:01,143
And I can hear them now!

1689
02:12:02,253 --> 02:12:06,586
The very words that they had sung

1690
02:12:07,782 --> 02:12:12,451
Became their last communion

1691
02:12:16,566 --> 02:12:19,485
On the lonely barricade…

1692
02:12:21,782 --> 02:12:24,406
at dawn.

1693
02:12:26,584 --> 02:12:29,654
Oh my friends, my friends, forgive me

1694
02:12:31,998 --> 02:12:36,517
That I live and you are gone

1695
02:12:36,946 --> 02:12:39,650
There’s a grief that can’t be spoken

1696
02:12:40,994 --> 02:12:47,180
There’s a pain goes on and on…

1697
02:12:47,313 --> 02:12:51,349
Phantom faces at the window

1698
02:12:51,475 --> 02:12:56,276
Phantom shadows on the floor

1699
02:12:56,433 --> 02:12:59,582
Empty chairs at empty tables

1700
02:13:00,076 --> 02:13:05,691
Where my friends will meet no more.

1701
02:13:05,941 --> 02:13:14,237
Oh my friends, my friends, don’t ask me

1702
02:13:14,651 --> 02:13:18,884
What your sacrifice was for

1703
02:13:19,869 --> 02:13:23,330
Empty chairs at empty tables

1704
02:13:27,009 --> 02:13:31,436
Where my friends will sing…

1705
02:13:33,530 --> 02:13:38,535
no more.

1706
02:14:01,877 --> 02:14:04,609
Every day
You walk with stronger step,

1707
02:14:04,744 --> 02:14:08,406
You walk with longer step.
The worst is over.

1708
02:14:08,616 --> 02:14:12,890
Don’t think about it, Marius!
With all the years ahead of us!

1709
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:17,743
I will never go away
And we will be together

1710
02:14:18,053 --> 02:14:19,813
Every day.

1711
02:14:22,284 --> 02:14:25,478
Every day

1712
02:14:26,346 --> 02:14:31,257
We’ll remember that night
And the vow that we made.

1713
02:14:32,641 --> 02:14:37,451
A heart full of love

1714
02:14:37,474 --> 02:14:39,839
She was never mine to keep

1715
02:14:39,869 --> 02:14:43,319
A night full of you

1716
02:14:43,375 --> 02:14:47,335
– She is youthful, she is free…
– The words are old but always true.

1717
02:14:47,895 --> 02:14:49,677
Cosette, Cosette!

1718
02:14:49,711 --> 02:14:52,286
– Love is the garden of the young
– I saw you waiting and I knew-

1719
02:14:52,287 --> 02:14:54,222
– Love is the garden of the young
– Thank God, you are here!

1720
02:14:54,223 --> 02:14:56,821
Waiting for you!

1721
02:14:56,822 --> 02:14:57,915
– Thank God, thank God you are home!
– Let it be!

1722
02:14:57,916 --> 02:14:59,476
– Thank God, thank God you are home!
– At your feet!

1723
02:14:59,477 --> 02:15:02,299
– Thank God, thank God you are home!
– Let it be!

1724
02:15:03,906 --> 02:15:11,295
– A heart full of love
– And it wasn’t a dream

1725
02:15:11,529 --> 02:15:19,529
– This I give you this day.
– Not a dream after all.

1726
02:15:25,077 --> 02:15:28,426
M’sieur, this is a day
I never can forget.

1727
02:15:29,436 --> 02:15:33,168
Is gratitude enough For
giving me Cosette?

1728
02:15:33,908 --> 02:15:37,868
Your home shall be with us
And not a day shall pass

1729
02:15:38,206 --> 02:15:41,664
But we will prove our love
To you, whom we shall call

1730
02:15:41,688 --> 02:15:45,896
A father to us both,
A father to us all.

1731
02:15:45,956 --> 02:15:48,834
Not another word, my son.

1732
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:55,516
There’s something now that must be done…

1733
02:16:01,694 --> 02:16:04,694
There lived a man
whose name was Jean Valjean.

1734
02:16:08,967 --> 02:16:12,154
He stole some bread
to save his sister’s son

1735
02:16:16,612 --> 02:16:19,932
For nineteen winters served his time

1736
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:27,138
In sweat he washed away his crime.

1737
02:16:29,584 --> 02:16:31,144
Years ago,

1738
02:16:32,245 --> 02:16:34,924
He broke parole and lived a life apart…

1739
02:16:35,778 --> 02:16:38,563
How could he tell Cosette
and break her heart?

1740
02:16:39,822 --> 02:16:43,015
Marius, it’s for Cosette
this must be faced:

1741
02:16:43,108 --> 02:16:45,988
If he is caught, she is disgraced…

1742
02:16:46,137 --> 02:16:49,027
The time has come to journey on,

1743
02:16:50,304 --> 02:16:55,223
And from this day he must be gone!

1744
02:16:57,363 --> 02:16:58,791
Who am I?

1745
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:03,158
Who am I?

1746
02:17:04,639 --> 02:17:08,918
You’re Jean Valjean!

1747
02:17:10,967 --> 02:17:12,917
Monsieur, you cannot leave!

1748
02:17:13,382 --> 02:17:16,949
Whatever I tell my beloved Cosette
She will never believe me.

1749
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:21,969
Tell her I've gone on a journey
A long way away.

1750
02:17:22,704 --> 02:17:25,225
Tell her my heart was too full
for farewells-

1751
02:17:25,865 --> 02:17:27,154
It is better this way.

1752
02:17:27,569 --> 02:17:30,769
Promise me, Monsieur,
Cosette will never know…

1753
02:17:30,819 --> 02:17:33,957
What I have spoken, why I must go.

1754
02:17:36,766 --> 02:17:38,686
For the sake of Cosette…

1755
02:17:41,475 --> 02:17:45,035
it must be so.

1756
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:47,800
Thank you Marius.

1757
02:18:01,174 --> 02:18:03,574
Where’s he gone without a word

1758
02:18:03,878 --> 02:18:06,578
That wouldn’t be his way to go

1759
02:18:06,964 --> 02:18:09,087
Why so sudden, why so strange?

1760
02:18:09,127 --> 02:18:12,523
Did he say how long he'll be gone?

1761
02:18:12,552 --> 02:18:17,971
What he asked for me to say
is he's on a journey far away.

1762
02:18:18,839 --> 02:18:20,639
He can’t leave us now

1763
02:18:21,522 --> 02:18:23,760
How he breaks my heart.

1764
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:31,298
And we will never be apart.

1765
02:18:33,352 --> 02:18:34,929
I promise.

1766
02:18:45,003 --> 02:18:50,524
Ring out the bells
Upon this day of days!

1767
02:18:52,097 --> 02:18:57,298
May all the angels
Of the Lord above

1768
02:19:00,059 --> 02:19:07,517
In jubilation
Sing their songs of praise!

1769
02:19:08,417 --> 02:19:14,293
And crown this blessed time
With peace and love!

1770
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:18,183
The Baron and Baroness du Thenard

1771
02:19:19,613 --> 02:19:23,079
Go away, Thenardier!

1772
02:19:23,203 --> 02:19:26,548
Do you think I don’t know who you are?

1773
02:19:26,993 --> 02:19:30,173
He’s not fooled! Told you so!

1774
02:19:30,438 --> 02:19:33,560
Show Monsieur
what you’ve come here to show.

1775
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:37,138
Tell the boy what you know!

1776
02:19:37,958 --> 02:19:40,643
Pity to disturb you at a feast like this

1777
02:19:41,373 --> 02:19:44,706
But 500 francs surely wouldn’t come amiss.

1778
02:19:44,959 --> 02:19:47,208
In God’s name say what you have to say.

1779
02:19:47,493 --> 02:19:49,664
He speaks.
You pay!

1780
02:19:49,965 --> 02:19:54,057
What I saw, clear as light,

1781
02:19:54,573 --> 02:19:57,602
Jean Valjean in the sewers one night,

1782
02:19:58,586 --> 02:20:01,333
Had this corpse on his back

1783
02:20:01,472 --> 02:20:05,313
Some boy he’d killed in a vicious attack.

1784
02:20:05,946 --> 02:20:09,162
I was there, never fear!

1785
02:20:09,538 --> 02:20:13,645
I even found me this fine souvenir!

1786
02:20:14,403 --> 02:20:17,260
I know this! This was mine!

1787
02:20:17,948 --> 02:20:21,133
This is surely some heavenly sign!

1788
02:20:21,938 --> 02:20:24,891
Then it’s true! Then I’m right!

1789
02:20:25,338 --> 02:20:29,948
Jean Valjean was my saviour that night!

1790
02:20:30,847 --> 02:20:34,805
Jean Valjean- the old con.

1791
02:20:34,918 --> 02:20:38,290
You pay up and I’ll say where he’s gone.

1792
02:20:38,346 --> 02:20:39,400
Where is he?

1793
02:20:44,771 --> 02:20:46,795
Where is he?
– The convent!

1794
02:20:47,769 --> 02:20:49,714
Cosette. Come with me.

1795
02:20:51,047 --> 02:20:53,943
Watch the buggers dance
Watch’em till they drop!

1796
02:20:54,167 --> 02:20:56,946
Keep your wits about you
And you stand on top!

1797
02:20:56,985 --> 02:20:59,646
Masters of the land
Always get our share

1798
02:20:59,747 --> 02:21:02,440
Clear away the barricades
And we’re still there!

1799
02:21:02,471 --> 02:21:04,908
We know where the wind is blowing

1800
02:21:05,021 --> 02:21:07,768
Money is the stuff we smell-

1801
02:21:16,543 --> 02:21:17,808
How dare you?!

1802
02:21:28,531 --> 02:21:32,185
Alone I wait in the shadows

1803
02:21:33,817 --> 02:21:36,767
I count the hours until I sleep.

1804
02:21:38,909 --> 02:21:42,867
I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by

1805
02:21:43,391 --> 02:21:47,644
It made her weep
To know I die…

1806
02:21:52,674 --> 02:21:56,123
Alone at the end of the day

1807
02:21:58,241 --> 02:22:01,408
Upon this wedding night I pray

1808
02:22:03,386 --> 02:22:08,745
Take these children,
my Lord, to thy embrace

1809
02:22:10,155 --> 02:22:17,660
And show them grace…

1810
02:22:20,664 --> 02:22:26,700
God on high

1811
02:22:29,289 --> 02:22:33,101
Hear my prayer

1812
02:22:37,787 --> 02:22:39,607
Take me now

1813
02:22:43,241 --> 02:22:45,169
To thy care

1814
02:22:48,888 --> 02:22:52,745
Where you are

1815
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:58,462
Let me be

1816
02:23:02,709 --> 02:23:05,245
Take me now

1817
02:23:08,910 --> 02:23:11,235
Take me there

1818
02:23:14,665 --> 02:23:17,920
Bring me home

1819
02:23:21,546 --> 02:23:25,128
Bring me home!

1820
02:23:29,035 --> 02:23:33,371
Monsieur I bless your name…

1821
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:35,671
I am ready, Fantine…

1822
02:23:36,750 --> 02:23:41,460
Monsieur lay down your burden…

1823
02:23:41,484 --> 02:23:43,284
At the end of my days…

1824
02:23:44,424 --> 02:23:47,976
You raised my child in love,

1825
02:23:48,027 --> 02:23:49,328
She’s the best of my life…

1826
02:23:49,367 --> 02:23:56,912
And you will be with God.

1827
02:24:05,179 --> 02:24:08,013
Papa, papa, I do not understand-

1828
02:24:08,123 --> 02:24:11,279
Are you all right?
Why did you go away?

1829
02:24:14,126 --> 02:24:17,180
Cosette, my child!
Am I forgiven now?

1830
02:24:17,322 --> 02:24:20,375
Thank God, thank God,
I’ve lived to see this day!

1831
02:24:21,151 --> 02:24:23,719
It’s you who must forgive
a thoughtless fool!

1832
02:24:23,863 --> 02:24:28,071
It’s you who must forgive a thankless man!

1833
02:24:29,263 --> 02:24:32,925
It’s thanks to you that I am living,

1834
02:24:33,304 --> 02:24:36,840
And again I lay down my life at your feet.

1835
02:24:37,497 --> 02:24:40,846
Cosette, your father is a saint!

1836
02:24:41,565 --> 02:24:47,164
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade,

1837
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:53,726
Carried like a babe,
And brought me home…

1838
02:24:54,891 --> 02:24:56,709
to you!

1839
02:25:07,157 --> 02:25:09,707
Now you are here

1840
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:17,405
Again beside me

1841
02:25:21,203 --> 02:25:24,632
Now I can die in peace

1842
02:25:26,453 --> 02:25:30,801
For now my life is blessed…

1843
02:25:31,926 --> 02:25:37,501
You will live, papa
You’re going to live

1844
02:25:37,551 --> 02:25:43,291
It’s too soon
Too soon to say goodbye.

1845
02:25:43,687 --> 02:25:50,106
Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die!

1846
02:25:51,353 --> 02:25:53,241
I’ll obey

1847
02:25:55,897 --> 02:25:57,795
I will try…

1848
02:25:59,823 --> 02:26:02,010
On this page

1849
02:26:03,386 --> 02:26:07,961
I write my last confession.

1850
02:26:10,893 --> 02:26:12,719
Read it well

1851
02:26:13,515 --> 02:26:17,188
When I at last am sleeping.

1852
02:26:20,105 --> 02:26:22,089
It’s the story

1853
02:26:22,985 --> 02:26:26,511
Of one who turned from hating

1854
02:26:27,649 --> 02:26:30,242
A man who only learned to love

1855
02:26:31,542 --> 02:26:34,351
When you were in his keeping.

1856
02:26:37,041 --> 02:26:40,172
Come with me

1857
02:26:40,274 --> 02:26:46,053
Where chains will never bind you

1858
02:26:46,686 --> 02:26:49,668
All your grief

1859
02:26:49,737 --> 02:26:54,500
At last, at last behind you

1860
02:26:55,305 --> 02:26:58,490
Lord in heaven

1861
02:26:58,873 --> 02:27:03,327
Look down on him in mercy-

1862
02:27:03,519 --> 02:27:06,384
Forgive me all my trespasses

1863
02:27:06,512 --> 02:27:09,899
And take me to your glory!

1864
02:27:12,604 --> 02:27:15,776
Take my hand

1865
02:27:15,888 --> 02:27:21,588
I’ll lead you to salvation

1866
02:27:21,753 --> 02:27:24,664
Take my love

1867
02:27:24,961 --> 02:27:30,341
For love is everlasting…

1868
02:27:31,274 --> 02:27:34,374
And remember

1869
02:27:34,674 --> 02:27:39,352
The truth that once was spoken:

1870
02:27:39,823 --> 02:27:45,546
To love another person
Is to see the face…

1871
02:27:45,969 --> 02:27:52,084
of God…

1872
02:27:52,131 --> 02:27:55,246
Do you hear the people sing

1873
02:27:55,531 --> 02:27:57,746
Lost in the valley of the night?

1874
02:27:58,588 --> 02:28:02,931
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light

1875
02:28:03,805 --> 02:28:09,834
For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies

1876
02:28:09,921 --> 02:28:15,707
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise.

1877
02:28:16,091 --> 02:28:22,603
We will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord

1878
02:28:22,657 --> 02:28:28,816
We will walk behind the ploughshare
We will put away the sword

1879
02:28:28,881 --> 02:28:34,016
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward!

1880
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:40,318
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?

1881
02:28:40,453 --> 02:28:46,162
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?

1882
02:28:46,225 --> 02:28:52,004
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?

1883
02:28:52,548 --> 02:28:58,243
This is the future that we bring
When tomorrow comes!

1884
02:28:58,331 --> 02:29:04,071
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?

1885
02:29:04,172 --> 02:29:09,791
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?

1886
02:29:09,958 --> 02:29:15,870
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?

1887
02:29:15,972 --> 02:29:22,196
This is the future that we bring
When tomorrow comes…

1888
02:29:30,859 --> 02:29:38,660
Tomorrow comes!
