Hey, wait a minute.
How come you guys ain't

347
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,690
We got inspected last week.

348
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:05,941
Lucky you.

349
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,192
Okay, Cherry.

And Cherry, this is Pee Wee.

363
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,682
I'll say. What do you use
for a jock strap, kid,

364
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,559
a peanut shell
and a rubber band?

365
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,643
Hey.

366
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,562
We're gonna have to tie
a board across his ass.

367
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,813
He's liable to fall in.

368

369
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,651
You bastard, Tommy.

Save your energy, needle dick.
You're gonna need it.

371
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,408
Okay. Oh, God.

372

377
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:16,303
That's crooked, Frankie.
You been
screwing around corners?

378
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,971
This is
the pride of Angel Beach,

Anthony Tuperello,
affectionately
known as "Meat."

380
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,517
My God,

[Chuckling]

382
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,064
Okay, let's move it out.

383
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,525
Yo.

384
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,111
You guys take
a number and sit down.

385
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,113
We'll just be a minute.

386

Yeah, we know.

387
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,242
That boy really is deformed.

388
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,161
I know.

389
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,537
Billy, this is my
friend John Conklin.

390
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,955
Hi, Conklin.

391
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,999
Okay, Cherry, sit down.

392
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,169
She touched
your nuts.

393
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,462
Her hands felt
like butter, man.

394
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,713
Hey, at least I got nuts.

395
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,006

you got filthy fourths,
you got fall-in fifths,

00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,104
you got slippin'
and slidin' sixths,

401
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,482
and you can scrape her
off the mattress, Mickey.

402
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,151
Okay, Cherry.
Cherry, get it started.
Go ahead.

403
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,278
Timmy that's...

404
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,447
Would you stop that?
[Cherry] You big mother.

Yeah, let's go!

419
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,439
Give it to her, Billy.

Oh. Keep pumping, Billy.

421

Keep pumping.
Come on, boys.

What's going on,
you motherfuckers?

I'll kill you white boys.

443

What the hell was that?

444
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,755
We didn't know
she was your wife.
Besides, it wasn't me.

445
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,840
It was him.
I was just watching.

446
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,550
You're both dead men.

447
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,302
What's this bullshit?

448
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,137
I'll kill you all.
No!

Slow night.

Don't worry.
That'll change soon enough.

469
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,507
What did I tell you?

470
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,182
Can't wait to
hear this story.

00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,269
I think I know that kid.

472

Pee Wee Morris.

473
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,355
The basketball player?

474
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,357
A friend of Mickey's,
my brother.

475
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,276
Well, what should we do?

476
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,737
Pull him over.

[Siren Blares]

478
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,288
Okay, pull over.

Hell, Pee Wee. We thought
you ran all the way home.

488
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,704
If we hadn't seen him,
he would have.

489
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,122
Oh, funny, a brother act.

and the girls go inside?

00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,808
Yes, sir?

501
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,893
I heard you run tail ass
from some nigger tonight.

No, no, we...
What's that, boy?

503
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,230
Who is this guy?

504
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,565
Tim's old man.

505
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,567
He just got out of prison.

506
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,444
You get your ass on home, boy!
Now!

507
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,388
Should've left him
there the last time.

508
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,681
What was he in for?

509
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,141
Manslaughter.
Killed a guy in a fight.

510
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,518
Tore his ear off
with his bare hands.

511
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:24,564
Guess my old man's not
such a bad guy after all.

512
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,527
Hey, what are you looking
so glum about, Pee Wee?

513
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,821
Look, man,
this is getting serious.
I gotta get laid.

514
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,324
I go more than a couple weeks,
I start to get jittery.

515
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,742
In that case,
you're due for
a nervous breakdown.

516
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,702
Oh, funny, Tommy.
Real funny.

517
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,788
I don't know what can we do.
If he strikes out
with Wendy Williams,

518
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,123
there's nothing
left but ham hocks.

519
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,458
Pee Wee's tired
of ham hocks.

520

697
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,280
Hey, Pee Wee.
[Shouting]

698
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,409
Get off! Meat!

699
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:00,996
Way to go, tiger.

700
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,456
You sure took care of
those guys, Pee Wee.

701
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,999
Jesus, what the hell was that?

702
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,043
The guy tried to muff dive
one of the strippers.

703
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,213
Damn good shot though.
He stuck his nose right in it.

704
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,549
Oh, Mickey.

705
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,551
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

706
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,139
All right.

707
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,314
It's your night, tiger.
Pick the one you want.

708
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,362
I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it.

709
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,864
Barkeep,
I'd like to talk to Porky.

710
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,407
Porky's busy.

711
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,409
He ain't too busy for
what I wanna talk about.

712
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,578
I wanna pay for some pussy.

713
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,787
Pay me.

714
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,164
I wanna talk to Porky.

715
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,127
Okay, if that's what you want.
[Chuckling]

716
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,507
See, you just gotta show him
who's boss, right?

717
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,593
Now, sit here...

718
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,178
In a minute, darlin'.

719
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,388
Now, sit here and do nothing.
Don't buy any drinks.

720
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:00,723
Their racket is
getting you to buy

721
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,016
these broads
overpriced drinks.

722
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,519
No kidding.
Hey, Mickey. Porky.

723
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,607

00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,281
Who's asking to see me?

726
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,324
Well...

727
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,284
[Clears Throat]
Mr. Porky, I am.

728
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,702
What do you want?

729
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,120
Well, Mr. Porky,

730
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,539
my friends and I here
would like to party
with five of your girls

731
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,708
upstairs in Porky's Pen.

732
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,210
You want five of my
piglets up in the pen?

733
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,795
Yes, sir.

734
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,129
For how long?

735
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,464
An hour.

736
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,882
What do you got to spend,
bottle caps?

737
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,300
A hundred bucks.

738
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,929
Oh. A hundred dollars
for five ladies, huh?

739
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,348
Go home,
snot-nose.

740
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,641
Hey, Porky, wait a minute.

741
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,351
Mr. Porky.

742
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,561
How many girls can
we have for $100?

743
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,606
There's five of you,
right?

744
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,399
That's a lot of horny dicks.

745
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,735
Give you two girls for an hour
or three girls
for a half hour.

746
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,028
That's all?

747
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,404
Hey, nobody's forcing you.

748
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,073
Now, it's a long ride
back home,

749
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,783
and it's even longer
with a hard-on.

750
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,785
Okay, we'll take
three for 30 minutes.

751
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,329
Okay. Pick out
what you want.

752
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,835
Her, her in the...
Oh, and her.

753
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,088
Hey, that's cash in advance.

754
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,298
No, Mick.

755
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,844
Hey, you,
that's the only way
I do business.

756
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,679
Okay, okay, no problem.
I've got it right here.

757
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,640
Here's 20, 40, 50, 60...

758
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,851
Not me. You pay the bartender,
you ridiculous dude.

759
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,688
And if any of you
guys get out of line
with any of my girls,

760
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,606
I personally am
gonna kick your candied

761
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,567
asses all the way
back to Angel Beach.

762
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,526
You hear me?

763
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,610
Yes, sir.

764
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:40,364
See that doorway over there?
You step in there,
and you wait.

765
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,117
Now, it's gonna be dark.
I don't want you
to be surprised.

766
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,661
Wait a minute.
What's this bullshit about?

767
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,663
This bullshit is you're
a pack of underage kids

768
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,040
and I don't want
my liquor license revoked.

769
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,877
The sheriff out here
happens to be a badass mother.

770
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:59,049
I don't want nobody to
see none of you with
any of my girls.

771
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,219
That's the back
way up to the pen.

772
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:06,307
Go through the door
and wait for a knock.

773
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,560
You talking about
that door over there?

774
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,686
That door.

775
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,397
Wait for a knock, step through
another door, and you're in.

776
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,318
And the girls will be
in there waiting for you.

777
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,527
You like that, kid?

778
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,778
Yeah.

779
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:23,324
I'm gonna give you
a night to remember.

780
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,076
You little piece of shit.

[Pee Wee] Did you see
those broads, you guys?
They are really hot.

782
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,048
[Meat] Remember,
they're paid to be hot,
Casanova.

783
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,759
[Tim] I don't like
this one bit. I think
we're being had.

784
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,761
[Mickey] No sweat, Tim.
It's under control.

785
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,763
[Pee Wee] I can smell pussy
behind that door.

786
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,349
[Tommy] I can't feel
any door.
[Tim] See, I knew it.

787
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,392
Are you ready, boys?

788
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,519
[Mickey] Hell, yeah.
We're ready, Porky.

789
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,147
Are you sure you're ready?

790
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,775
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

791
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:01,195
Okay, here comes
your night to remember.

792
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,155
[All Shouting]

793
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:07,910
Goddamn it!

794
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,411
I'm drowning! I'm drowning!

795
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,955
It's only two feet deep.

796
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,123
[Porky] Watch out,
there might
be alligators down there.

797
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,459
Everything's
under control, huh?
Mr. Big Shot.

798
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,628
Mickey,
you promised to get me laid.

799
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,797
You're a horseshit procurer.

800
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,382
Procurer what?
We're out 20 bucks apiece.

801
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,008
I'll take care of this.

802
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,302
[Porky] Set 'em up,
bartender.

803
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,346
Whatever they want.

804
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,686
Shut the fuck up!

805
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,397
I want to see Porky,
and I want to see him now!

806
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,149
Get that piece of
pig shit out here!

807
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,071
How was the pussy, boys?

808
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,948
[Laughing]

809
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,161
I want a piece
of your fat ass.

810
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,665
Sure, you do.
Let's step outside.
We don't want to ruin...

811
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,209
Fine with me, fat man.

812
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:04,383
Mickey, look, I don't
mind you being stupid,
but this is crazy.

813
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,468
Get out of here!
Move it!

814
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,931
Shit!

815
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,058
[Laughing]

816
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:16,020
[Siren Blaring]
Go on back to
your own damn town.

817
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:32,202
Hold it.

818
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,499
You better
fucking freeze, buster!

819
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,297
What's going on here, Pork?

820
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,631
I was giving
the old place an enema

821
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:47,384
and this pile of shit come
floating up to the surface.
Hey.

822
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,763
Shut up, boy.
Just shut up.

823
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,351
Well, it looks
like to me we got

824
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,479
five Angel Beach
assholes here.

825
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,357
Yes, sir.

826
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,611
Five walking, talking rectums.
[Chuckles]

827
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,157
Where's your car, boy?

828
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,201
Right there.

829
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,539
You from Seward County?

830
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,249
Yeah.

831
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,335
I don't know much about
the laws in Seward County

832
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,129
but we got laws here
about driving with
busted headlights.

833
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,757
I don't have
a busted headlight.

834
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,384
Don't have
a busted headlight?

835
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,386
Shit!
[Laughing]

836
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,849
That's a $35 fine.
Thirty-five bucks
or a night in jail.

837
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,728
Shit. I got 15 bucks.

838
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,146
I got five.

839
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,564
You got five?
You got 15, huh?

840
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:43,649
I got 12.

841
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,775
I think I got three.

842
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,026
Watch this.

843
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,197
Goddamn it!
[Laughing]

844
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,576
You got
a busted taillight too.
That's 20 more dollars.

845
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,786
Can you cover it?

846
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,037
I got 10.

847
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:00,290
Give it to me.
Give me all you got.

848
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,465
I guess I can show
a little leniency for

849
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,425
first offenders.
What do you say, Pork?

850
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,594
Should I give these
nice lads a break?

851
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,055
Oh, they seem
like a nice bunch

852
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,599
of clean-cut
Angel Beach pussies.

853
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,937
A little smelly.
Yeah, give 'em a break.
[Chuckling]

854
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,023
You heard the man.

855
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,067
You get your
candy asses back over

856
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,194
to Seward County and
you keep 'em there.

857
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,990
This here's a man's county.
Go on, get the fuck out.

858
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,826
Go on. Go on.

859
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,748
Go on. Here we go.

860
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,335
Here we go.
Go on home now.

861
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,337
[Porky] I don't think
they'll be coming back.

862
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,257
Let's go back inside.
[Laughing]

863
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,641
[Billy] The worst thing is
you guys are out 100 bucks.

864
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,144
This is just the kind of thing
you write off.

865
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,146
Again?
I got it last time.

866
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,148
Great.

867
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,233
Mick, I'm telling you,
they're bad mothers.

868
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,444
I'm going back
to get that pig.

869
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,613
Yeah, right, Mick.

870
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,031
Yeah, Meat!

871
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,616
Mickey, are you crazy?

872
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,913
Trying to be a big man?

873
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,540
Forget it, okay?
We lost. Come on.

874
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,668
What do you think this is?
What are you,
a tough guy or something, huh?

875
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,587
Evening, Morris.
Howdy.

876
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,632
You don't look too
terrific tonight, brother.

877
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:32,758
I'm okay.

878
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,552
I understand you tried
to butt heads with Porky.

879
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,596
I'd have whipped him
if it hadn't been
for that sheriff.

880
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,015
You know something?
That scumbag
sheriff sided with Porky.

881
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,351
Yeah, well,
that scumbag sheriff
is Porky's brother.

882
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,353
What? Shit.

883
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:45,479
Just great.

884
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:46,730
Now, just where
were you headed?

885
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,732
Back to Porky's.

886
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,275
Listen, Junior,
you go back and he kicks

887
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,902
your ass again,
what you gonna do?

888
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,154
Go back. Just keep going back.

889
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,367
This guy's dangerous.
I mean, he's playing
around with you now,

890
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:02,246
but he's gonna
get tired of you,
then he's gonna hurt you bad.

891
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,292
Am I gonna have to
take you home myself?

892
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,378
All right, I'm going home.

893
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,505
[Engine Starts]
Good night.

894
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,554
Redneck.

895
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,848
Do you think he's
really going back?

896
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,558
It runs in the family,
I'm afraid.

897
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:24,893
What's up?

898
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,561
He wanted to go after Porky.

899
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,315
Just hope he
lives to outgrow it.

900
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,825
[Whispering]
[Chuckling]

901
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:44,329
The girls are waiting,
Miss Honeywell.

902
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,721
How's Lassie?

903
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,472
Lassie's fine.

904
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,183
She's still a virgin,
but she's fine.

905
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,311
You, on the other hand,
are gonna be dead

906
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,147
if you don't tell me
why they call her Lassie.

907

[Howls]

908
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,125
[Whistle Blows]
Cavanaugh, you get wiped out
by that kick every time.

909
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,127
When are you gonna learn, son?

910
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,047
All right, give me number six.

911
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,631
[Whistle Blows]

912
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,350
[Blows Whistle]
Cavanaugh, get off the floor.

913
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,018
It was an accident, Coach.

914
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,686
Bullshit.
That was no accident.

915
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,065
Now, get off the floor now.
You're suspended indefinitely.

916
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:56,693
Nobody who plays like that
plays for me. Move.

917
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,365
You all right, son?

918
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,284
Yeah.

919
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,467
Anybody wanna go fly a kite
with me tonight?

920
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,262
I think it's great weather
for flying kites.

921
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:28,308
I wonder if
there are any kites
around here we can fly.

922
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,811
Hey, listen, Cavanaugh.

923
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,105
It's not "kites."

924
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:37,651
It's "kike."
K-I-K-E. Kike.

925
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,738
You know, you're too stupid
to even be a good bigot.

926
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:43,323
Behind the gym,
Jew boy.

927
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:46,118
As soon as the coaches
are gone, Jew boy.

928
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:48,245
Suit yourself.

929
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,214
Asshole.

930
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,739
Shoot. This guy's a ringer.

931
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,907
Yeah.

932
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,414
Get him, Tim!

933
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,999
Come on, Timmy!

934
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,628
Nice move, Tim.
[Grunts]

935
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,798
Get him, Tim.

936
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,219
Get him, Timmy.

937
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,057
Ow. Geez.

938
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:58,148
All right, Tim, that's enough.
Knock it off! Knock it off!

939
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:01,985
That's enough.
All right!
It's over! Let me go!

940
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,404
All right, shake hands.

941
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,781
Go on.

942
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,585
How did you learn
to fight like that?

943
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,712
Listen, when you're Jewish,
you either

944
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,839
learn to fight or
you take a lot of shit.

945
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,966
I don't like to take shit,

946
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,969
so I learned how to box,
and I studied
a little jujitsu.

947
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,971
That Japanese stuff, right?
Yeah.

948
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,098
How often have
you had to use it?

949
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,226
Well, this was the first time.

950
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,353
Were you sure
you'd remember how?

951
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,563
Well, I was hoping.

952
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,148
[Chuckles]

953
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,026
Look, Brian,
Tim's our buddy,

954
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,613
but you gotta understand
he's got problems.

955
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,739
Yeah, I noticed.

956
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,950
See, it's real easy for him
to take it all out on you,

957
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,952
'cause he thinks
you're putting him down.

958
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,120
He's not a bad guy.

959
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,331
He's a prick.

960
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,503
You're right.
He's a prick.

961
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:02,879
He's a schmuck.

962
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,089
What?

963
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,465
A schmuck.

964
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,009
That's Jewish
for prick, right?

965
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,345
Yeah, sort of.

966
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:11,930
Yeah, well.

967
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,432
Anyway, even though
he's a schmuck,

968
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,519
and we don't like
everything he does,

969
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,895
but he's still
our buddy, you know?

970
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,313
Yeah.

971
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,650
I understand.

972
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,487
Well, listen,
I got to go.

973
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:28,780
Yeah.

974
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,240
See you guys later.

00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,575
Take it easy, Brian.

976
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,368
So long, Brian.

00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:21,249
I'm looking for
a friend of mine.
He's supposed to be there.

988
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:23,001
What's his name?

989
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,794
His name's Michael Hunt.

Okay, just hang on a minute.

from what I heard.

00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,951
Hey, Frank,
ask one of the car hops
if Mike Hunt's outside.

what's wrong with Meat?

1014
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,636
I thought he didn't drink.

1015
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:57,971
Well, he doesn't,

1016
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:00,557
but he just found out today
he got turned
down by Princeton.

1017
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:01,766
Princeton sucks!

1018
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:03,059
Yeah.
Princeton?

1019
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,227
It sucks!

1020
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,564
I thought he had
scholarship offers
from 60 other colleges.

1021
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,566
Yeah, he does,
but for some reason,

1022
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,609
he had his heart
set on Princeton.

1023
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,612

for bringing
Anthony some sugar.

1029

How many cubes of sugar
does your cousin require

1030
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,680

too much insulin?

[Retching]

1032
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,852
Two cubes of sugar

1033
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,022
usually is enough
to bring Anthony around.

1034
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,903
Oh, feel better now, huh?

1035
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,655

00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,008
Me neither.
I wouldn't even know

1040
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,010
how to fill out
the forms on that.

1041
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,263
Yeah, you're right.
It would be a lot of hassle.

1042
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,182
I guess we better save him.

1043
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,142
Yeah, I guess we better.

1044
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,190
You know, I'm not a doctor,

1045
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,317
but I could swear
this youngster's inebriated.

1046
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,485
Oh, no, Officer.

1047
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:36,694
Not at all. Not at all.

1048
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:40,782
Well, now, if you guys
say he's a diabetic, okay,

1049
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,784
but if we find out he's drunk,

1050
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,911
we're gonna book
the whole lot of
you as accessories.

1051
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,414
He's smashed.
The son of a bitch
does it all the time.

1052
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,422
Officer, excuse me,
but I couldn't help

1053
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,800
but notice
what's been happening.

1054
00:52:58,884 --> 00:52:59,926
And who are you?

1055
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,094
Oh, just a bystander.

1056
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,096
Brian Schwartz is my name.
Brian.

1057
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,098
I don't know if
this is important,

1058
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,100
but I overheard
this poor fellow saying

1059
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,102
that the reason he'd
gotten drunk tonight

1060
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,938
is that his girlfriend
had just broken up with him.

1061
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,358
Now, tell me, gentlemen,
wouldn't you be
likely to toss down a few

1062
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,194
if the woman you love
turned her back on you?

1063
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:21,573
[Snickers]
If my wife left me,
I'd get drunk for joy.

1064
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,536
All right. Get him out of here
and get him home. Now.

1065
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,037
Thank you, Officer.

1066
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,581
Thank you. Will do.

1067
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,293
[Laughs]
Oh.

1068
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,131
You're one smooth mother,
Schwartz.

1069
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,258
Well, you do what you can.

1072
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,598
It's Mickey.

1073
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,600
Porky's.
Oh, Jesus.

1074
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,810
Here we go again.

1075
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,812
[Revving]

1076
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,234
Holy shit!

1077
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,652
Holy shit.

1078
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,071
Did you whip him?

1079
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,323
Hell, yes.

1080
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,409
I used my face to break
the son of a bitch's hand.

1081
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,202
[Moans]

1082
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:13,666
Pee Wee,
you better go call Ted.

1083
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,586
I don't feel so good.

1084
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,712
I hate to do this,

1085
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,714
but we better get
him to a hospital.

1086
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,716
All right. I'll get my car.
Hospital? Hospital?

1087
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,760
Mickey. Mickey,
where you going?

1088
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,930
I'm goin' home,
you son of a bitch,
what do you think?

1089
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,808
Don't worry, old buddy.
I learned my lesson.

1090
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,644

[Tires Squealing]

1092
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:41,945
We're gonna have
to babysit with him.

1093
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,988
That won't stop him.

1094
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,168
[Chattering]

1095
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,762
Did you see
Timmy's face?

1096
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:09,889
Yeah, we saw it.

1097
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,226
Shorts, shirt...

1098
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,479
You really worked him over,
didn't you, Schwartz?

1099
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,148
Hey, I didn't do that.
I hardly touched his face.

1100
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,484
Just a few little jabs.
I couldn't have done that.

1101
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,902
You didn't do it.

1102
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,320
Well, what happened?

1103
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,822
His old man.

1104
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,741
His father? Why?

1105
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:32,245
'Cause he got into
a fight with a Jew,
and he lost.

1106
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:52,056
Coach, can I talk to you
about Cavanaugh?

1107
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,063
Oh, come on, Lynn.

1108
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,148
Oh, Brackett.

1109
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,191
Brackett, you know
I don't go all the way.

1110
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,193
Who said anything
about going all the way?

1111
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,487
We're just gonna go up
and have a cup of coffee

1112
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,489
in the equipment room.
No!

1113
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,491
Come on, Lynn.
No, no, no, no.

1114
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,119
Tell you a little secret.

1115
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:17,331
[Whispering]
I already know that.

1116
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,625
Miss Honeywell,
do you mind?

1117
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:22,253
Do I mind what?

1118
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,297
It's disgusting.

1119
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:27,091
The two of you

1120
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:31,137
squirming about
like a pair of eels in heat.

1121
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,388
You're a disgrace.

1122
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:35,016
Yeah? Well, it sure beats
stomping and waddling around

1123
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,060
like a frigid hippopotamus,
Beulah.

1124
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,770
What did you call me?

1125
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:42,774
Beulah. Beulah "Balbreaker."

1126
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,359
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1127
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,403
If I heard
a hurdy-gurdy playing,

1128
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,114
I'd think I was talking
to the fat lady in the circus,

1129
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:53,034
but as it is,
I guess I'm talking
to a ton of bad news

1130
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,953
named Beulah, Beulah, Beulah!

1131
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,038
Look, ladies,
I don't...

1132
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,289
You butt out.

1133
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,292
Moral turpitude.

1134
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,668
What?

1135
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,128
Moral turpitude!

1136
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:07,298
Read your contract,
Miss Honeywell.

1137
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:11,260
I'll have you fired
for moral turpitude.

1138
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,346
You can take
your moral turpitude

1139
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,432
and you can stick it
up the old gazoo, Beulah.

1140
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,811
Gee, Lynn,
I don't know.

1141
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,354
"Moral turpitude."

1142
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,730
Oh, come on.

1143
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,275
[Warren] All right, Brian.

1144
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1145
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:32,657
I'll talk
to Coach Goodenough.

1146
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,866
[Brian] I appreciate that.

1147
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,076
But don't expect too much.

1148
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,662
Now come on.
We're late for practice.

1149
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:40,373

00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,754

Oh, smell.

1152
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,056
Oh, smell that air.

1153
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,892
[Sniffs] Mmm! Oh, boy.

1154
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,103
Oh, boy. [Sniffs]

1155
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:07,024
The boys' locker room
always turned me on.

1156
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,151
Really?

1157
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,236
Yeah.

1158
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,529
Yeah?

1159
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,073
Yeah!

1160
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:16,701

I don't know why.

1166
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,344
Well, that's really
interesting, Lynn,

1167
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:36,596
but why don't you
give me a hand here.

1168
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:37,847
I mean,

1169
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,516
it always turned me
on and I really...

1170
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:41,767
I don't know why.

1171
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,060

do you realize

happy to apprehend
