00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,080
<i>Let us praise famous men...</i>

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,080
<i>and our fathers that begat us.</i>

3
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,080
<i>All these men...</i>

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,400
<i>were honoured in their generations...</i>

5
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>and were a glory in their days.</i>

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,440
We are here today to give thanks...

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,880
for the life of Harold Abrahams.

8
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,480
To honour the legend.

9
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,120
Now there are just two of us...

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,720
young Aubrey Montague...

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,040
and myself...

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,640
who can close our eyes...

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,800
and remember those few young men...

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,400
with hope in our hearts...

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,080
<i>and wings on our heels.</i>

16
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,340
<i>Carlton Hotel, Broadstairs, Kent.</i>

17
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,500
<i>28th June, 1924.</i>

18
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,300
<i>Dear Mum. I'm most awfully sorry about</i>
<i>your cold and the general dreariness.</i>

19
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,940
<i>We're also having</i>
<i>quite bad weather here, too.</i>

20
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,540
<i>Thanks for your letters.</i>
<i>I'm sorry you and Pa are disappointed...</i>

21
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,460
<i>I should be letting the Olympic Games</i>
<i>interfere with my shorthand.</i>

22
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,940
<i>But if you were my age, with a chance</i>
<i>to win the World Championship in Paris...</i>

23
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,380
<i>you would be just as big a fool as I am.</i>

24
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,020
<i>By the way, it's awfully kind of Pa</i>
<i>to finance me here, in spite of my idiocy.</i>

25
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,260
<i>It's marvellous for esprit de corps.</i>
<i>Most of the chaps have managed to get down.</i>

26
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,340
- Cricket, Montague, in the ballroom.
- Now!

27
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,780
No ball!

28
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,940
Come on, Aubrey, the old leg break.

29
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,980
- Howzat!
- Not out.

30
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,580
What? You could hear it
in bloody Bournemouth!

31
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,340
- Come on, Liddell, my innings.
- I didn't touch it.

32
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,140
- You heard the crack of my wrist.
- I saw the bloody thing bend!
- Andy!

33
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,220
No tickle for me.

34
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,380
He's out, I tell you.
You're all deaf and bloody blind.

35
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,180
Aubrey, I ask you, for God's sake!

36
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,300
It's not fair!

37
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,700
All right.

38
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,540
<i>Harold's here. As intense as ever.</i>

39
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,700
<i>Just as he was</i>
<i>on our very first day at Cambridge.</i>

40
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,860
<i>I remember we shared a taxi together.</i>

41
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,060
I'll take these.

42
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,060
- See you inside, Aubrey.
- Right.

43
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,220
Thank you.

44
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,780
- Name, please.
- We're new.

45
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,060
I can see that, laddie. What's your name?

46
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,220
Abrahams. HM.

47
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,540
- Top of the list. Repton. That the one?
- That's it. Left a year ago.

48
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,260
- Been doing your bit, 'ave you? France?
- No. Joined too late.

49
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,980
Bad luck, lad.

50
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,660
Many a dead man
would have liked a share of it.

51
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,820
You're right there, son.

52
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,060
Welcome to Caius.

53
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,620
- Sign here.
- Thank you.

54
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,780
It's across the courtyard,
top right-hand corner, up the stairs.

55
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,300
Thanks.

56
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,020
By the way, what are your names?

57
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,540
Rogers, head porter,
and this is Mr Ratcliffe, my assistant.

58
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,740
Well, Mr Rogers, Ratcliffe...

59
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,180
I ceased to be a "laddie" when
I took up the King's commission.

60
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,580
- Is that clear?
- Yes... Mr Abrahams.

61
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,660
- Quite clear.
- Thank you.

62
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,220
I'd be obliged if you'd remember it.

63
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,420
- See you later.
- Fine.

64
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,820
What's your friend studying, then, son?

65
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,980
Barrack-room law?

66
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,620
I've no idea.

67
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,420
One thing's certain.

68
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,260
A name like Abrahams, he won't be
in the chapel choir, now, will he?

69
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,540
- Name?
- Montague.

70
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,700
- What?
- Montague.

71
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,980
I take the war list...

72
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,140
and I run down it.

73
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,220
Name after name which I cannot read...

74
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,700
and which we, who are older than you...

75
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,460
cannot hear, without emotion.

76
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,980
Names which will be only names to you...

77
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,140
the new college.

78
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,100
But which to us summon up face after face...

79
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,460
full of honesty and goodness...

80
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,420
zeal and vigour...

81
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,300
and intellectual promise.

82
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,100
The flower of a generation.

83
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,220
The glory of England...

84
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,380
and they died for England...

85
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,780
and all that England stands for.

86
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,260
And now by tragic necessity,
their dreams have become yours.

87
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,260
Let me exhort you. Examine yourselves.

88
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,420
Let each of you discover...

89
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,700
where your true chance of greatness lies.

90
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,500
For their sakes...

91
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,060
for the sake of your college
and your country, seize this chance.

92
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,220
Rejoice in it...

93
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,780
and let no power or persuasion
deter you in your task.

- Try bird-watching. You can take a book.

How can I watch if I'm reading a book?

What's so special about that?

In all the 700 years, nobody's ever done it.

Right, chaps, thank you! Thank you.

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,980
Let it be known that HM Abrahams
of Gonville and Caius...

139
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,060
has formally made challenge
for the college dash.

140
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,260
You show 'em, Harold!

141
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,700
For those not familiar with the rules...

142
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,500
The challenger will attempt
to run around the court perimeter...

143
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,860
to and from a point beneath the clock...

144
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,980
within the time taken
by the clock to strike midday.

145
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,940
A distance traditionally
recognised as one of 188 paces.

146
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,460
I say, Abrahams, what have you got
on your feet? Rockets?

147
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,940
The challenge will commence on the...

148
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,740
- Abrahams, you haven't got a chance!
- Do it for Israel!

149
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,220
The challenge commences
on the stroke of one.

150
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,300
The challenger must finish
before the stroke of 12.

151
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,460
Come on, Abrahams, you swank!

152
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,020
Will the challenger make himself ready?

153
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,780
This Abrahams.
What do you know about him?

154
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,860
Repton chap.

155
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,260
Jewish.

156
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,700
- His father's a financier in the city.
- Financier?

157
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,340
What's that supposed to mean, I wonder?

158
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,500
I imagine he lends money.

159
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,300
Exactly.

160
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,620
And what do they say about the son?

161
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,660
Academically sound. Arrogant.

162
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Defensive to the point of pugnacity.

163
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,420
Mm. As they invariably are.

164
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,020
Yet possessing
a keen sense of duty and loyalty.

165
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,020
Do they say he can run?

166
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,940
Like the wind.

167
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,660
Gentlemen, would you draw back, please?
Away from the course.

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,420
Thank you.

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,020
Owing to the absence
of any other challenger...

171
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,020
Mr Abrahams will run alone.

172
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,220
Not so, Mr Starter!

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,300
Lindsay. I race beside my friend here.

175
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,060
We challenge in the name
of Repton, Eton and Caius.

176
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,780
<i>- I didn't know you ran.</i>
- Nor I you.

177
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,620
Some chap just told me about this.
I thought I'd come and push you along.

178
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,260
- Delighted.
- Splendid.

179
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,460
Good luck.

180
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,460
Gentlemen, to your marks, if you please.

181
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,500
Now remember, on the first strike of 12.

182
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,740
Come on!

183
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,140
<i>Eight!</i>

184
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,380
Nine!

185
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,980
Ten!

186
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,540
- <i>Eleven!</i>
- Go on! Go on!

187
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,020
Did they both do it?

188
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,180
I think not.

189
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,700
- Young Lindsay failed by a whisker.
- Pity.

190
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,900
<i>Well, it's been done.</i>
<i>And by a Caius man! You must be very proud.</i>

191
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,060
<i>The first man in seven centuries.</i>

192
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,340
<i>Perhaps they really are</i>
<i>God's chosen people, after all.</i>

193
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,740
<i>I doubt if there's a swifter man</i>
<i>in the kingdom.</i>

194
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,300
Get to your marks.

195
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,900
Get set.

196
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,140
<i>He may be your best friend, Sandy,</i>
<i>but he's my best brother.</i>

197
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,540
<i>I'm thinking of him</i>
<i>and not your blessed athletics team.</i>

198
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,660
<i>His heart's set on following Father</i>
<i>in the mission.</i>

199
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,860
Do you not think he's busy enough
without taking up racing?

200
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,100
He's fast, Jennie.
You've seen him with a ball in his hands.

201
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,340
I've seen him with a Bible in his hands.

202
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,500
And I know which is the most important.

203
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,660
You can't deny him the chance.

204
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,420
Get him on the track, I'm telling you...

205
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,220
Don't tell me, Sandy. I don't want to hear.

206
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,340
Eric's special to me. Precious.

207
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,180
I don't want his work spoilt
with all this running talk, do you hear?

208
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,140
There you are. Well done.

209
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,340
You know, ladies and gentlemen...

210
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,100
one of the compensations
of achieving a certain notoriety...

211
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,900
if only as a rugby player...

212
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,140
is that occasionally
you're asked to give things away.

213
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,620
It's often said that giving beats receiving.

214
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,620
Let me tell you...

215
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,420
the look of delight
on those little boys' faces...

216
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,020
was worth ten of the tin pots gathering
dust on my Edinburgh sideboard.

217
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,100
When we were in China, my father here...

218
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,140
was always waxing lyrical
about his wee home in the glen.

219
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,420
But being oriental-born myself...

220
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,180
like my brothers and my sister here...

221
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,980
I suffered from a natural incredulity.

222
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,180
But looking about me now...

223
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,340
the heather on the hills...

224
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,980
I can see he was right.

225
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,140
It's very special.

226
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Thank you for welcoming us home.

227
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,100
And thank you...

228
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,620
for reminding me that I am,
and will be whilst I breathe...

229
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,900
a Scot.

230
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,060
Mr Provost, sir.

231
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,980
Before you allow Eric here to go...

232
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,420
Is it not true that the main event
of the meeting is still to be run?

233
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,220
<i>It is. Aye.</i>

234
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,500
The 200-yards open championship.

235
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,140
It's the last event
of this gathering, by tradition.

236
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,540
Do you not think,
if we can find him some kit...

237
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,580
we might persuade Scotland's
finest wing to show us his paces?

238
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,780
What do you say, Eric?

239
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,540
<i>To your marks!</i>

240
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,980
Get set!

241
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,820
Didn't I tell you, Eric? Didn't I tell you?

242
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Surely a touch of liberality
would do no harm.

243
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,500
Sandy, the kingdom of God
is not a democracy.

244
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,140
The Lord never seeks re-election.

245
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,900
There's no discussion, no deliberation...

246
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,540
no referenda as to which road to take.

247
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,580
There's one right, one wrong...

248
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,740
one absolute ruler.

249
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,460
- A dictator, you mean.
- Aye, but a benign, loving dictator.

250
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,180
So much for your freedom of choice.

251
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,420
<i>You've still got a choice, Sandy.</i>

252
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,580
Nobody's forcing you to follow it.

253
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,700
Hey, hey!

254
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,060
- Do you know what day it is?
- Yeah.

255
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,220
- Tell me, then.
- Sunday.

256
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,940
The Sabbath's not a day
for playing football, is it?

257
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,580
No.

258
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,940
- Are you up early in the morning?
- Me ma gets me up at seven.

259
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,100
We'll have a game then, then. OK?

260
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,260
Mr Liddell, is it OK if me da comes?

261
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,580
Sure. Bring your whole family.

262
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,740
I'll give ye a five-goal start.

263
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,180
You've got a train to catch at nine.

264
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,380
There's plenty of time.

265
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,940
Do you want the kid to grow up
thinking God's a spoilsport?

266
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,380
If I may, I'd like to propose a toast.

267
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,180
To the Liddell family...

268
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,820
whom I'm fortunate enough
to call my friends.

269
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,780
The Reverend JD, Mrs L, young Ernest.

270
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,740
<i>Bon voyage and safe journey back to China.</i>

271
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,220
May the years ahead be happy and content.

272
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,700
For those who remain,
may God protect them...

273
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,500
inspire them...

274
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,420
and lead them to glory.

275
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,700
Thank you, Sandy. That was very nice.

276
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,580
I'm relying on you now
to keep them all out of mischief.

277
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,060
That I will, Mrs L. If they do transgress,
I'll pop the details on a postcard.

278
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,220
You can read all about it
before you can say Marco Polo.

279
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,460
Cost you a fortune in postage stamps.

280
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,900
Don't worry. I shall protect my investment.

281
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,060
I'm going to rule you with a rod of iron.

282
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,140
We're going to have to watch ourselves!

283
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,020
You're a very lucky young man, Eric.

284
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,380
You're the proud possessor of many gifts.

285
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,380
And it's your sacred duty
to put them to good use.

286
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,980
Dad's right. Run like we know you can,
strong and true.

287
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,940
The mission cannot but gain
by your success.

288
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,580
What we need now is a muscular Christian.

289
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,980
To make folks sit up and notice.

290
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,500
How good are you, Eric?

291
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,820
Sandy reckons he'll run for Scotland
before the month's out.

292
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,460
Then after that... the sky's the limit.

293
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,020
Meaning what?

294
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,100
The Olympic Games, maybe?

295
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,340
Eric, you can praise the Lord
by peeling a spud...

296
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,500
if you peel it to perfection.

297
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,860
Don't compromise.
Compromise is a language of the devil.

298
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,980
Run in God's name...

299
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,700
<i>and let the world stand back in wonder.</i>

308
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,880
You came to see a race today.

309
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,040
To see someone win.

310
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,560
It happened to be me.

311
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,280
But I want you to do more
than just watch a race.

312
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,160
I want you to take part in it.

313
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,040
I want to compare faith to running in a race.

314
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,520
It's hard.

315
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,960
It requires concentration of will.

316
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,600
Energy of soul.

317
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,360
You experience elation...

318
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,520
when the winner breaks the tape...

319
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,840
especially if you've got a bet on it.

320
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,760
But how long does that last?

321
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,920
You go home. Maybe your dinner's burnt.

322
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,480
Maybe you haven't got a job.

323
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,800
So who am I to say believe...

324
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,240
have faith, in the face of life's realities?

325
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,120
I would like to give you
something more permanent...

326
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,280
but I can only point the way.

327
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,360
I have no formula for winning the race.

328
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,880
Everyone runs in her own way...

329
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,080
or his own way.

330
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,120
And where does the power come from
to see the race to its end?

331
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,200
From within.

332
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,040
Jesus said...

333
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,800
"Behold, the kingdom of God is within you."

334
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,840
"If with all your hearts ye truly seek me...

335
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,160
ye shall ever surely find me."

336
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,960
If you commit yourself...

337
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,120
to the love of Christ...

338
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,440
then <i>that is how you run a straight race.</i>

339
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,120
Cheers. Thanks for coming.

340
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
It's an ache.

341
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,760
A helplessness.

342
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,720
And an anger.

343
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,760
One feels humiliated.

344
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,720
Sometimes I say to myself,
"Steady on, you're imagining all this."

345
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,600
Then I catch that look again.

346
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,640
Catch it on the edge of a remark.

347
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,960
Feel a cold reluctance in a handshake.

348
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,360
That's my father.

349
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,520
A Lithuanian Jew.

350
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,120
He <i>is alien.</i>

351
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,280
- He's as foreign as a frankfurter.
- A kosher one at that!

352
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,520
I love and admire him.

353
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,960
He worships this country.

354
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,320
From nothing, he built what he believed...

355
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,040
was enough to make
true Englishmen of his sons.

356
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,120
My brother's a doctor.

357
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,720
A leader in his field.

358
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,520
- Which one is he?
- That's me with the curls, on his back.

359
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,320
He wanted for nothing.

360
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
And here am I.

361
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,200
<i>Setting up shop</i>
<i>in the finest university in the land.</i>

362
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,160
But the old man forgot one thing.

363
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,040
This England of his is Christian...

364
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,200
and Anglo-Saxon.

365
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,920
And so are her corridors of power.

366
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,400
And those who stalk them
guard them with jealousy and venom.

367
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,800
You're right to study law.
You're quite an advocate.

368
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,480
A rare ethnic advantage.
It's called the gift of the gab.

369
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,960
So what now? Grin and bear it?

370
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
No, Aubrey.

371
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,880
I'm going to take them on. All of them.

372
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,520

373
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,000

4-1 Liddell! What are you asking?

404
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,840
£25, Liddell to win.

405
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,880
Mr Mussabini, I believe.

406
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,160
My name's Keddie. Colonel John Keddie.

407
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,600
- I'm...
- President of the Scottish Three A's.

408
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,480
I know, and I'm glad to know you, sir.

409
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,360
- <i>Monsieur Sam! Bonjour.</i>
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

410
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,120
- How's the leg?
- OK.

411
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
Nasty fall you took.

412
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,080
<i>Enchanté. Good luck.</i>

413
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,360
You're very welcome here, of course.

414
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,560
But we do have a strict amateur code.

415
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,480
Colonel, don't worry your head.

416
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,480
I'm here spectating, that's all.

417
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,920
Good. I felt sure you would understand.

418
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,160
Well, to battle!

419
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,320
I hope you enjoy the games.

420
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,280
Games? You must be joking.

421
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,840
I've seen better-organised riots.

422
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,880
Come on, Scotland!

423
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,080
<i>Vive la France!</i>

424
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,120
Gentlemen, get to your marks.

425
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,280
Get set.

426
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,160
Get up, lad. Get up.

427
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,320
<i>Yeah.</i>

428
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,360
He'll never do it.

429
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,880
Don't you believe it. His head's not back yet.

430
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,800
Come on, Eric!

431
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,720
Get back! Give him air!

432
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,600
Well done, Eric, son. Well done.

433
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,760
He'll be right in a jiffy.
I'll go away and get his clothes.

434
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,720
You take good care
of this lad o' yours, Mr McGrath.

435
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,840
Because if you drop him,
you'll never find another one like this.

436
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,080
It's not the prettiest quarter
I've ever seen, Mr Liddell.

437
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,240
But certainly the bravest.

438
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,440
Get him up. Come on, gently.

439
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,000
Keep your arm around.

440
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,560
Mr Mussabini.

441
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,800
Mr Abrahams, is it?

442
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,000
So you've travelled 300 mile just to see me?

443
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,760
You and Liddell.

444
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,920
I'd heard you were both the best.

445
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,080
And what do you think now?

446
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,240
Eric Liddell?

447
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,000
I've never seen such drive,
such commitment in a runner.

448
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,680
He runs like a wild animal.

449
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,560
He unnerves me.

450
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,440
So he should.

451
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,120
He frightens the living daylights out of me.

452
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,960
I want you to help me take him on.

453
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,760
Tell me, Mr Abrahams. Are you married?

454
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,920
No. Why?

455
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,480
Well...

456
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,360
when the right girl comes along...

457
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,720
how will you feel if she pops the question?

458
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,480
You see, Mr Abrahams...

459
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,520
like the bridegroom...

460
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,120
it's the coach that should do the asking.

461
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,320
Mr Mussabini...

462
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,440
I can run fast.

463
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,400
With your help, I think I can run even faster.

464
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,840
Perhaps faster than any man ever ran.

465
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,680
I want that Olympic medal.

466
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,600
Now, I can see it there.

467
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,880
It's waiting for me.

468
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
But I can't get it on my own.

469
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,200
Well, we've an old saying in my game, son.

470
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,360
You can't put in what God's left out.

471
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,200
Now, you leave it to me.

472
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,640
I'll watch you. I'll observe.
And if I think I can help...

473
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,520
if I can see the big prize hanging there...

474
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,120
believe me, I won't waste any time.

475
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,560
When we meet again...

476
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,760
I'll be the one that does the begging.

477
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,800
So you will watch me?

478
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,960
Son, if you're good enough...

479
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,320
I'll take you apart piece by bloody piece.

480
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,080
Thank you.

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,960

Yes.

Always talking about me!

00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,000
Good evening, Miss Gordon!

524
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,200
A triumph, I hear.

525
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,320
Who was that chap over there?

526
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,840
Music critic of the <i>Star.</i>

527
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,240
- Boring old buffer, really.
- Well, he obviously enjoyed it.

528
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,440
I shouldn't think so.

529
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,760
They always say that.
They save the poison for the print.

530
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,720
- A bit off tonight, I thought.
- What? You were magnificent!

531
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,880
Thank you.

532
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,440
One of my little maids has gone and
got herself preggers with a gondolier.

533
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,760
We had to shove her second on tonight.
The trio...

534
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,720
- Your usual, Miss Gordon?
- Thank you, Toffy.

535
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,920
And you, sir.

536
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,800
Thank you.

537
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,840
This is Mr Abrahams.
He's a very famous runner.

538
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,960
He's trying your special
for the first time tonight.

539
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,840
- I hope you enjoy it, sir.
- I'm sure I shall.

540
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,760
Well, go on then!

541
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,760
It's a secret concoction of Toffy's...

542
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,920
a sort of cocktail <i>de maison...</i>

543
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,320
so you'd jolly well better enjoy it.

544
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,520
- Excellent.
- There, Toffy!

545
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,080
You've won yourself a friend for life.

546
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,400
My favourite, please.

547
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,400
- For two.
- My pleasure.

548
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,440
What have I ordered?

549
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,360
Surprise.

550
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,520
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

551
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,960
Well... the great Harold Abrahams.

552
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,760
My brother will be insanely jealous.

553
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,920
So will mine.

554
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,800
You don't look very ruthless.

555
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,480
Should I?

556
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,440
According to my brother.
Tim says that's why you always win.

557
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,680
- Why running?
- Why singing?

558
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
It's my job.

559
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,520
No, that's silly. I do it because I love it.

560
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,600
Do you love running?

561
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm more of an addict.
It's a compulsion. A weapon.

562
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,240
- Against what?
- Being Jewish, I suppose.

563
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,200
You're not serious?!

564
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,720
You're not Jewish...

565
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,920
or you wouldn't ask.

566
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,280
Fiddlesticks!

567
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,440
People don't care.

568
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,680
Anyway, being Jewish
hasn't done you any harm.

569
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,600
I'm what I call semi-deprived.

570
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,960
That sounds clever. What does it mean?

571
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,800
It means they lead me to water,
but they won't let me drink.

572
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,560
You're a funny old stick,
Mr Harold Abrahams.

573
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,720
Funny...

574
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,840
but fascinating.

575
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,120
I'll settle for the fascinating.

576
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,640
Life isn't that gloomy, is it?

577
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,160
Not tonight.

578
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,920
You're so beautiful.

579
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,560
Like you.

580
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,320
<i>Le pied de porc anglais, madame.</i>

581
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,640
Pigs' trotters.

582
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,640
Oh, my God.

583
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,120
<i>The train arriving at platform two...</i>

584
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,640
<i>is the Flying Scotsman from Aberdeen.</i>

585
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,520
7.30, Mr Liddell! 7.30 on t'dot.

586
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,720
There you are, sir. Hot tea and toast.

587
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,200
Great.

588
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,440
- You sleep all right?
- Like a log.

589
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,080
Aye. Must have a clear conscience.

590
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,240
Far from it.

591
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,600
- Are we here?
- Aye, sir. Just pulled in. King's Cross.

592
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Oh, and here's the paper, with your picture in.

593
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,200
Expecting great things, from all accounts.

594
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,360
Are they indeed?

595
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,760
- Here you are.
- Much obliged, sir.

596
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,000
Now, no hurry. You've got
an hour before we kick you out.

597
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,600
- And good luck for this afternoon.
- Thank you.

598
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,880
Come on, sir. Wake up. King's Cross.

599
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,440
Aye, Mr Abrahams. So's the Scot.

600
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,160
Mr Abrahams?

601
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,240
Mr Liddell.

602
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,040
I'd like to wish you the best of success.

603
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,280
Thank you. And may the best man win.

604
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,360
<i>Get to your marks.</i>

605
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,480
Get set.

606
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,640
Extraordinary.

607
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,920
<i>Harold.</i>

608
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,800
Harold.

609
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,040
This is absolutely ridiculous.

610
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,440
It's a race you've lost, not a relative.
Nobody's dead.

611
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,160
For goodness' sake, snap out of it, Harold.
You're behaving like a child.

612
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,400
- I lost.
- I know!

613
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,080
I was there, remember? Watching.

614
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,320
It was marvellous.

615
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,040
You were marvellous.

616
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,520
He was more marvellous, that's all.

617
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,680
On the day, the best man won.

618
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,840
I had to look for him.

619
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,760
It's absolutely fundamental. You never look.

620
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,520
He was ahead. There was nothing you
could have done. He won fair and square.

621
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,480
Well, that's that, Abrahams.

622
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,160
If you can't take a beating, it's for the best.

623
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,320
I don't run to take beatings!

624
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,760
I run to win.

625
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,960
If I can't win, I won't run.

626
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,600
If you don't run, you can't win.

627
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,160
Ring me when you've sorted that one out.

628
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,320
Sybil...

629
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,360
Don't go.

630
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,160
I just don't know what to do.

631
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,320
Try growing up.

632
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,440
Harold.

633
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,160
You're a great man.

634
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,320
You ran like a god.

635
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,320
I was proud of you. Don't make me ashamed.

636
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,480
It's not the losing, Syb.

637
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,320
Eric Liddell's a fine man and a fine runner.

638
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,480
It's me!

639
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,680
After all that work...

640
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,880
now, God knows, what do I aim for?

641
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,960
Beating him the next time.

642
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,120
Sybil, I can't run any faster.

643
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,880
<i>Mr Abrahams!</i>

644
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,360
Mr Abrahams!

645
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,240
I can find you another two yards.

646
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,200
<i>Charlie Paddock.</i>

647
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,520
Californian cannonball.
World's fastest human.

648
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,880
Winner, 100 metres, Olympic Games...

649
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,360
- 1920, Antwerp. Time?
- 10.3.

650
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,680
Jackson Scholz...

651
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,840
the New York Thunderbolt.

652
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,720
Runner-up, Olympic Games, 1920.

653
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,880
Lost by looking right.

654
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,120
Look, here's the finish. You see?

655
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,240
Paddock, leaping past him at the tape?

656
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,520
That glance cost Scholz the race.

657
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,960
- Scholz's fastest?
- 10.3... 4.

658
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,240
Eric Liddell. Well, you know all about him.

659
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,440
Look at them.

660
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,840
Think them. Breathe them.

661
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:19,040
I want their faces leering at you
every time you shut your eyes.

662
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,800
The Flying Scotsman first.
That bloody well hurt.

663
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,960
What, Eric Liddell?

664
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,120
Well, he's no real problem.

665
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,600
He's a great runner
but he needs to go further out.

666
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,480
- He's no 100-metres man.
- He could have fooled me!

667
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,400
Yeah, he's fast.

668
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,160
But he won't go any faster, not in
the dash, anyway. He's a gut runner.

669
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,320
He's all heart. Digs deep.

670
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,160
A short sprint is run on nerves.

671
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,520
- It's tailor-made for neurotics.
- Thanks very much.

672
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,600
No, I mean it. You can push guts,
bully them, but you can hone nerves.

673
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,960
Paddock, Scholz and Eric Liddell.

674
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,920
Come here a minute, Mr Abrahams.

675
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,760
Now, do you know
why you lost the other day?

676
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,920
Because you're overstriding.

677
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,080
Just a couple of inches. Now...

678
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,040
These coins represent the strides
in your hundred metres.

679
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,720
Have you got another two coins,
Mr Abrahams?

680
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,160
Well, maybe we can find them.

681
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,320
As I said...

682
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,280
overstriding.

683
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,360
Death to the sprinter.

684
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,320
Slap in the face each stride you take.

685
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,520
Knocks you back.

686
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,960
Like that. Like that...

687
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,120
and that!

688
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,600
Now...

689
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,080
I want you to imagine
you're running on hot bricks.

690
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,640
If you leave your feet too long
on the ground, they'll get burnt.

691
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,000
Up, up, up. Light, light, light!
Light as a feather.

692
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,120
Set!

693
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,560
No! Not your head back again!

694
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,480
Get it level! Go and do it again.

695
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,760
That's it!

696
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,480
Faster, come on!

697
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,920
Pass the car! Go on!

698
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,480
Go on! Go on!

699
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,800
Go on, go on, on, on!

700
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,840
Come on, now! Keep it up, come on!

701
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,360
Rhythm, Mr Abrahams, rhythm!

702
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,240
<i>Training, training. All I ever hear is training.</i>

703
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,160
<i>Do you believe in</i>
<i>what we're doing here or not?</i>

704
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,320
Look, Jennie, I'm sorry.

705
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,120
I was late. I apologise.

706
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,360
- It's all very well, Eric.
- Look, I said I was sorry.

707
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,400
To me. It's not me you've insulted.

708
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,560
Away with your bother!

709
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,440
The Lord'll not feel slighted
at the missing of a bus.

710
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,840
Yes, Eric, you missed a bus. But why?

711
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,000
Your mind's not with us any more, son.

712
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,960
It's full of running and starting
and medals and pace.

713
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,920
It's so full of it,
you've no room for standing still.

714
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,520
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie!

715
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,680
Don't fret yourself.

716
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,320
I do fret myself, Eric.

717
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,040
I'm frightened for you.

718
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,800
I'm frightened for what it all might do to you.

719
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,280
<i>Please, Mr Liddell.</i>
Would you sign your name, please?

720
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,240
Surely.

721
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,640
You want to pick yourself a pen?

722
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,360
- There you are.
- Thanks.

723
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,880
Come on, Jennie, let's go for a walk.
I've got something to say.

724
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,640
It's a sight and a half, in't it, Jennie?

725
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,240
Auld Reekie. I'll be sad to leave it.

726
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,960
I've decided.

727
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,680
I'm going back to China.

728
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,400
The missionary service have accepted me.

729
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,720
Oh, I'm so pleased!

730
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,320
But I've got a lot of running to do first.

731
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,560
Jennie...

732
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,960
Jennie, you've got to understand.

733
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,640
I believe that God made me for a purpose.

734
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,720
For China.

735
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,880
But he also made me fast.

736
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,400
And when I run... I feel his pleasure.

737
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,920
To give it up would be
to hold him in contempt.

738
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,080
You were right.

739
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,680
It's not just fun.

740
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,400
To win is to honour him.

741
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,880
Jennie...

742
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,800
Jennie.

743
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,240
I've got my degree to get.

744
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,080
All that work.

745
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,040
Then there's Paris.

746
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,080
The Olympic Games.

747
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,680
There's just not enough of me.

748
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,320
I'm asking you to manage
the mission on your own...

749
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,480
till then.

750
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,600
Will you do that for me, Jennie?

751
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,640
<i>Andy, I've lost him.</i>

752
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,480
Can't reach him.

753
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,120
<i>You will, old girl. You will.</i>

754
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,040
He says he needs to clear his mind of me.

755
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,960
He can't love me and say that.

756
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,640
Syb.

757
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,240
The world's against him, or so he believes.

758
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,800
Now he's got a chance to prove himself.

759
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,160
He can't see or hear anything
beyond that, not even you.

760
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,080
It's hard, I know,
but you've just got to try and understand.

761
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,320
- Why should I?
- Because he's what you want, isn't he?

762
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,400
What about you?

763
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,520
And Stallard and Aubrey?

764
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,520
You're still the same.
The chance is there for you too.

765
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,880
To be <i>a fastest, yes, but not the fastest.</i>

766
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,240
The fastest man ever before.

767
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,280
Father's never going to learn how to do that.

768
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,400
That's immortality.

769
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,360
Just think what it means to a man like Harold.

770
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,080
Well, to me the whole thing's fun.
I don't need that.

771
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,240
"Cast care aside" and all that.

772
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,840
But for Harold, it's a matter of life and death.

773
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,160
- So all I can do is wait?
- 'Fraid so.

774
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,440
And pray like hell that he wins!

775
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,960
And if he doesn't?

776
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,840
You mustn't worry, old thing.

777
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,960
I've never ever seen a man
so smitten as our Harold.

778
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,200
It's just that I'm a little envious, that's all.

779
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,880
Oh, Andy.

780
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,920
- Your parasol, Miss Gordon.
- Thank you, Mildred.

781
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,520
Good luck tonight.

782
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,720
He's a damned fool!

783
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,560
I always thought the Irish had all the luck!

784
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,800
- John, Savoy Theatre.
- Yes, sir.

785
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,960
Splendid.

786
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,160
Mildred, would you get my spikes?

787
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,360
Ready, my lord!

788
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,360
Now, Coote, if I shed a drop I want to know.

789
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,520
Touch but not spill, what?

790
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,120
<i>Life slips by, Abrahams.</i>

791
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,520
<i>Life slips by.</i>

792
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:38,080
But this fine old university of ours,
she offers some rare consolations.

793
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,240
Beyond measure, sir.

794
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,920
I can take it, then, that you would
be acutely grieved to discover...

795
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,760
that any behaviour or action
on your part were causing her grief?

796
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,520
Naturally, sir. I would, deeply.

797
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,680
Good. I was sure of it.

798
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,120
Here in Cambridge, we've always
been proud of our athletic prowess.

799
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,320
We believe, we've always believed,
that our games are indispensable...

800
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,720
in helping to complete
the education of an Englishman.

801
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,880
They create character.

802
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,760
They foster courage, honesty and leadership.

803
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,480
But most of all,
an unassailable spirit of loyalty...

804
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,640
comradeship and mutual responsibility.

805
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,920
- Would you agree?
- Yes, sir. I would.

806
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,520
I'm afraid there is a growing suspicion
in the bosom of this university...

807
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,840
and I tell you this without in any way...

808
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,200
decrying your achievements,
in which we all rejoice...

809
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,880
that in your enthusiasm for success...

810
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,080
you have perhaps lost sight
of some of these ideals.

811
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,880
May I ask what form
this disloyalty, this betrayal, takes?

812
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,240
- Oh, hardly betrayal!
- The word grief was mentioned.

813
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,640
It's said that you use a personal coach.

814
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,880
Mr Mussabini, yes.

815
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,040
- Is he Italian?
- Of Italian extraction, yes.

816
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,120
- I see.
- But not all Italian.

817
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,120
- I'm relieved to hear it.
- He's half Arab!

818
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,120
Do we take it that you employ this
Mr Mussabini on a professional basis?

819
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,760
Sam Mussabini is the finest,
most advanced...

820
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,160
clearest-thinking athletics coach
in the country.

821
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,680
I'm honoured to be worthy of his attention.

822
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,840
Nevertheless, he's a professional.

823
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,040
What else would he be? He's the best.

824
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,040
But there, Mr Abrahams,
I'm afraid our paths diverge.

825
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,640
You see, this university believes
that the way of the amateur...

826
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,120
is the only one to provide
satisfactory results.

827
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,280
I am an amateur.

828
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,520
You're being trained by a professional.

829
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,000
You've adopted a professional attitude.

830
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,720
For the past year, you have concentrated
on developing your own technique...

831
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,920
in the headlong pursuit,
may I suggest, of individual glory.

832
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,240
Not a policy very conducive to
the fostering of <i>esprit de corps.</i>

833
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,920
I am a Cambridge man first and last.

834
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,280
I am an Englishman first and last.

835
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,680
What I have achieved, what I intend
to achieve, is for my family...

836
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,080
my university and my country.

837
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,280
And I bitterly resent
your suggesting otherwise.

838
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,520
Your aim is to win at all costs, is it not?

839
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,320
At all costs, no.
But I do aim to win within the rules.

840
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,280
Perhaps you would rather
I played the gentleman and lost?

841
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,920
To playing the tradesman, yes.

842
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,640
My dear boy, your approach has been,
if I may say so, a little too plebeian.

843
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,560
You are the elite...

844
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,520
and are therefore expected
to behave as such.

845
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,920
Thank you, sir...

846
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,760
for your hospitality.

847
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,520
The evening has been most illuminating.

848
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,920
Good night to you, sir.

849
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,560
You know, gentlemen...

850
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,800
you yearn for victory, just as I do.

851
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,960
But achieved with
the apparent effortlessness of gods.

852
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,720
Yours are the archaic values
of the prep school playground.

853
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,240
You deceive no one but yourselves.

854
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,880
I believe in the pursuit of excellence...

855
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,440
and I'll carry the future with <i>me.</i>

856
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,280
Well, there goes your Semite, Hugh.

857
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,840
A different god.

858
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,640
A different mountain top.

859
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,120
<i>Harold! Harold! We're in.</i>

860
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,440
All of us!
You, Henry, Andy and me, we're all in!

861
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,040
You 100 and 200, Andy 400 and hurdles...

862
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,840
Henry the mile, and me the steeplechase.

863
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,000
Paris, here we come!

864
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,240
Eric Liddell's picked too.

865
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,320
Rivals under the same flag.

866
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,480
Your chance to get even, eh?

867
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,760
I can't wait.

868
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,320
Welcome to Dover, my Lord Birkenhead.

869
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,760
Lord Birkenhead,
are the Yanks so well trained...

870
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,160
that they'll wipe the floor with our boys?

871
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,960
It's certainly true that
the Americans have prepared seriously...

872
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,600
some would say too seriously,
to gain success.

873
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:57,360
But we feel we may, in our
unsophisticated way, have their match.

874
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,160
Sir, do you think
the British team stand a chance...

875
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,960
against such great American athletes
as Charlie Paddock and Jackson Scholz?

876
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,840
You Americans have a number of men
who are rated as world-beaters...

877
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:13,560
but this contest is in Europe,
not in the rarefied climes of the United States.

878
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,480
Parisian conditions are bound
to be more robust...

879
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,680
more combative and certainly more cavalier.

880
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,840
Lord Birkenhead,
are the Yanks so well trained...

881
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,680
that they will wipe the floor with our boys?

882
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,280
Gentlemen, Abrahams, Liddell and Lindsay...

883
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:31,440
We have the men who could
give them a run for their money.

884
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,680
Eric!

885
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:43,040
Sandy! You haven't come all the way
from Scotland just to see me off, have you?

886
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,160
I have not. I'm seeing myself off.

887
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,320
Come on, or we'll miss the boat.

888
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,240
Hey, Mr Liddell! What do you think
of your chances against Abrahams?

889
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,400
I'll do my best. Can do no less.

890
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,560
Mr Liddell, sir!

891
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,200
What about the qualifying heats on Sunday?

892
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,720
- What did you say?
- On Sunday!

893
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,280
Do you think you can beat the Americans?

894
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,680
There's Mr Abrahams! There he is!

895
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,880
- Mr Abrahams!
- Sorry, I've no time...

896
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,320
Hello, Jeremy.

897
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,120
- Gilbert and Sullivan will win.
- Thanks very much.

898
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,760
- Harold!
- Sybil.

899
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,280
- I came to wish you luck.
- I'm glad.

900
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,320
I understand. I wanted you to know that.

901
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,920
I'll be here when you come back.

902
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,080
<i>Hurry along, Mr Abrahams.</i>
She's about to sail!

903
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,200
I must go. I'll see you in three weeks.

904
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,400
Bye-bye.

905
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,720
Mind your step, sir.
We want you to get there in one piece.

906
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,400
- When did you get to know?
- Did you not read the papers this morning?

907
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,240
The heats for the 100 are on
the Sunday after the opening ceremony...

908
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,880
the semis and final a couple of days after.

909
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,560
It's only a heat.

910
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,920
Does it make all that difference?

911
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,480
Yeah.

912
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,640
Yeah, it does.

913
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,000
And strong though the temptation may be...

914
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:24,680
to disport your newly acquired finery
around the streets of Paris...

915
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,720
if they aren't temptation enough...

916
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,720
may I ask you on behalf
of the Olympic Committee...

917
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,680
to save your sartorial splendour...

918
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,200
until at least after the opening ceremony.

919
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,920
May I remind you...

920
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,080
you are the favoured few.

921
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,480
You constitute what is without doubt...

922
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,440
the most powerful athletic force
ever to leave these shores.

923
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,400
You are to face the world's best...

924
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,240
brown and yellow, white and black...

925
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,440
young and ardent as yourselves...

926
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,880
fleet of foot and strong of limb...

927
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,120
from every civilised nation
on the face of the earth.

928
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,400
I have no doubt...

929
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,640
that you will acquit yourselves
honourably and... with distinction.

930
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,360
Good luck to you all.

931
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,480
<i>Your mind's not with us any more.</i>

932
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,600
<i>It's full of sprinting and starting</i>
<i>and medals and pace.</i>

933
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,480
<i>It's so full of it,</i>
<i>you've no room for standing still!</i>

934
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,520
<i>Jennie, Jennie! Don't fret yourself.</i>

935
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,440
<i>I do fret myself, Eric. I'm frightened for you.</i>

936
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,240
<i>I'm frightened what it all might do to you.</i>

937
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,360
<i>- Do you know what day it is?</i>
<i>- Yeah. Sunday.</i>

938
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,800
<i>The Sabbath's not a day</i>
<i>for playing football, is it?</i>

939
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:06,440
<i>It's an awful step you're taking, Liddell.</i>

940
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,800
<i>The whole of Britain will be watching you.</i>

941
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,360
I don't know that they'll understand.

942
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,240
I'm not sure that <i>I understand.</i>

943
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,560
I'm not sure that I do either, sir.

944
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,560
For the last three years
I've devoted myself to my running...

945
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,800
just to be on this ship.

946
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,960
I gave up my rugby.

947
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,120
My work has suffered.

948
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,680
And I've deeply hurt someone
I hold very dear.

949
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,040
Because I told myself...

950
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,880
if I win, I win for God.

951
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,600
And now I find myself sitting here,
destroying it all.

952
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,360
But I have to.

953
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,560
To run would be against God's law.

954
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,360
I was mistaken.

955
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,240
My boy - as things stand, you must not run.

956
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,560
But I want you
to hold your fire for a while, Liddell.

957
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,760
Leave everything to me.

958
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,520
Say nothing. Wait until we get to Paris.

959
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,280
I'll have a word with the French.

960
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,560
I'm not without a certain pull...

961
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,760
and we fought in the war together.

962
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,920
They do owe us something.

963
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,080
I don't understand.

964
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,120
They're not a very principled lot, the Frogs.

965
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,680
But, when faced with a stand like yours...

966
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,840
one never knows.

967
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,000
I might get through.

968
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,160
I just might possibly persuade them.

969
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,320
The French, sir?

970
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,480
What can they do?

971
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,320
Shift that bloody heat of yours, of course.

972
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,480
Good evening.

I'm Eric Liddell.

1041
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,840
Well, we've heard a lot about you.

1042
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,720
Liddell!

1043
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,880
Excuse me.

1044
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,600
I was afraid you weren't here.

1045
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,760
I'm afraid I am, sir.

1046
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,480
Fine. Do you good.

1047
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,680
Take you out of yourself a bit.

1048
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,920
The Prince of Wales would like to meet you.

1049
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,600
No.

1050
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,760
No. No, sir.

1051
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,360
It wouldn't be right.

1052
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:45,960
Liddell... he is your future king.

1053
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,320
Are you refusing to shake his hand?

1054
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,200
Does your arrogance extend that far?

1055
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,200
My arrogance, sir, extends
just as far as my conscience demands.

1056
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,200
Fine.

1057
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,760
Then let's hope that's wise enough
to give you room for manoeuvre.

1058
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,440
All right, sir.

1059
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,680
Splendid. I'll take you to him now.

1060
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:32,560
Your Royal Highness,
may I present Mr Eric Liddell?

1061
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,720
Delighted, Liddell. Delighted.

1062
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,680
I saw you play for Scotland.
It depressed me no end.

1063
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,080
Ran in a couple of tries from your own half.

1064
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,120
I believe I did, sir, yes.

1065
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,760
Nice to have you on the same side at last.

1066
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,120
Excellent effort of Lindsay's, don't you think?

1067
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,520
- He did well, sir. He did indeed.
- An example to us all.

1068
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,120
Eric, may I introduce
His Grace the Duke of Sutherland...

1069
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,440
president of our Olympic Association?

1070
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,680
- How do you do?
- And our chairman, Lord Cadogan.

1071
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,120
<i>Have a seat.</i>

1072
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,040
Make yourself comfortable.

1073
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,440
Cigar?

1074
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,320
Oh, no, of course. You don't. Nor drink.

1075
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:18,080
Such is the resolution of the young man
you have before you, gentlemen.

1076
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,560
Lord Birkenhead has advised us
as to your attitude...

1077
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:31,400
towards your participation
in the 100-metres heats, Liddell.

1078
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,320
Or would your non-participation
be more accurate?

1079
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,480
It would, sir, yes.

1080
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,880
We were also consulted as to
how we should approach the French.

1081
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:44,520
Something we can't allow, going
cap in hand to the Frogs, of all people!

1082
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,680
Simply out of the question.

1083
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:51,040
A simple matter of national dignity.
Being a patriot, I'm sure you understand.

1084
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,200
I must say, sir,
I felt it was an impractical suggestion.

1085
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,680
Why didn't you damn well say so?

1086
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,040
As an athlete, you value economy of effort.

1087
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:02,800
I wanted to run.
I was desperate enough to try anything.

1088
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,360
Well, all that being understood...

1089
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,200
we decided to invite you in for a little chat...

1090
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:11,520
to see if there's any way
we can help resolve the situation.

1091
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:16,160
<i>There's only one solution. That's</i>
for this man to change his mind and run.

1092
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,560
<i>Don't state the obvious, Cadogan.</i>

1093
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:23,680
We've to explore ways in which we can help
this young man to reach that decision.

1094
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,120
I'm afraid there are no ways, sir.

1095
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,480
I won't run on the Sabbath and that's final.

1096
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,200
I intended to confirm this
with Lord Birkenhead tonight...

1097
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:37,560
even before you called me up
before this inquisition.

1098
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:39,040
Don't be impertinent.

1099
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:43,680
The impertinence lies with those who
seek to influence a man to deny his beliefs.

1100
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,200
On the contrary, Liddell.
We're appealing to your beliefs.

1101
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,600
In your country and your king.
Your loyalty to them.

1102
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:55,640
Hear, hear.
In my day, it was king first, God after.

1103
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,600
And the war to end wars
bitterly proved your point.

1104
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,440
God made countries. God makes kings...

1105
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,680
and the rules by which they govern.

1106
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:10,480
And those rules say that the Sabbath is his.

1107
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,920
And I for one intend to keep it that way.

1108
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,120
<i>Mr Liddell.</i>

1109
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,120
You're a child of your race... as I am.

1110
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:26,760
We share a common heritage,
a common bond, a common... loyalty.

1111
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,760
There are times when
we are asked to make sacrifices...

1112
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,920
in the name of that loyalty...

1113
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,520
and without them
our allegiance is worthless.

1114
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,840
As I see it, for you...

1115
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,720
this is such a time.

1116
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,280
Sir...

1117
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,360
God knows, I love my country.

1118
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,640
But I can't make that sacrifice.

1119
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,360
<i>Come in!</i>

1120
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,780
Your Royal Highness... Lord Lindsay.

1121
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:12,940
Your Highness, Cadogan, gentlemen.

1122
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:15,780
I do apologise for barging in like this.

1123
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:18,420
The fact is
I am fully aware of Eric's dilemma.

1124
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:23,340
I wondered if I could be so bold
as to suggest a possible solution.

1125
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,980
<i>Do.</i>

1126
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,740
Yes.

1127
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:29,900
Another day, another race.

1128
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:32,060
What the devil's that supposed to mean?

1129
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:34,340
It's quite simple as a matter of fact, sir.

1130
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,860
The 400 metres. It's on Thursday.

1131
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:39,020
I've already got my medal.

1132
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,940
So why don't you let Eric
take my place in the quarter?

1133
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:47,460
I think that's a splendid idea.

1134
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:50,740
Can we allow him to change events
at such short notice?

1135
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,660
That's a matter for the committee.

1136
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:56,860
We <i>are the committee.</i>

1137
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,620
I think it's a very good idea.

1138
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:02,060
David?

1139
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,020
All those in favour say aye.

1140
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,060
<i>Aye.</i>

1141
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,220
Liddell?

1142
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:11,900
- Andy, I...
- A pleasure, old chap.

1143
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:15,900
Just to see you run.

1144
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:21,860
Aye.

1145
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,860
<i>Well, that's settled.</i>

1146
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,980
A sticky moment, George.

1147
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:35,060
Thank God for Lindsay.
I thought the lad had us beaten.

1148
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:37,260
He did have us beaten, FE.

1149
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,580
- And thank God he did.
- I don't quite follow you.

1150
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:43,580
The lad, as you call him,
is a true man of principle...

1151
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,380
and a true athlete.

1152
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:48,580
His speed is a mere extension
of his life, its force.

1153
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,900
We sought to sever his running
from himself.

1154
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:54,100
For his country's sake, yes.

1155
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:56,260
No sake is worth that, FE.

1156
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:59,460
Least of all a guilty national pride.

1157
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,280
<i>"Lindsay makes way for Liddell."</i>

1158
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:22,280
"400 metres for defecting Scot."

1159
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,080
"'Smacks of fanaticism, ' says official."

1160
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,360
"'Man of principle, ' says primate."

1161
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,520
"We should be proud."

1162
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,480
- So that's the Olympic Stadium.
- That's it, Sam.

1163
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,680
It's as good as being in there, isn't it?

1164
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,600
Better! Seeing as I'm <i>persona non grata.</i>

1165
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,080
Yeah.

1166
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,080
It's tiptop, Mr Abrahams.
You've done a grand job.

1167
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,240
If we don't win now, we never will.

1168
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,000
Have I got everything, Sam?
Everything you need?

1169
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,120
Er...

1170
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,240
Yes.

1171
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,040
All we need now is Sunday.

1172
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:08,040
<i>My text this afternoon</i>
is taken from Isaiah, chapter 40.

1173
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,960
Behold.

1174
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,200
The nations are as a drop in the bucket...

1175
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,560
<i>and are counted</i>
<i>as the small dust in the balance.</i>

1176
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,360
<i>All nations before him are as nothing.</i>

1177
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,440
They are counted to him less than nothing...

1178
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,320
and vanity.

1179
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,880
He bringeth the princes to nothing.

1180
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,560
He maketh the judges of the earth as a vanity.

1181
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,360
Hast thou not known?

1182
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,680
<i>Hast thou not heard...</i>

1183
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:52,840
<i>that the everlasting God, the Lord...</i>

1184
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,440
<i>the creator of the ends of the earth...</i>

1185
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,440
<i>fainteth not...</i>

1186
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,600
<i>neither is weary?</i>

1187
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,800
Juvenile!

1188
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:08,640
Oldest con in the business.

1189
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,080
I know, Sam.

1190
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,760
He giveth power to the faint...

1191
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,880
and to them that have no strength...

1192
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,160
he increaseth might.

1193
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,600
<i>But they that wait upon the Lord...</i>

1194
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,720
<i>shall renew their strength.</i>

1195
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,520
<i>They shall mount up...</i>

1196
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,560
with wings, as eagles.

1197
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,760
<i>They shall run...</i>

1198
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,960
<i>and not be weary.</i>

1199
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,480
<i>They shall walk...</i>

1200
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,200
<i>and not faint.</i>

1201
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:24,920
<i>Do you remember when we first</i>
bumped into each other, old man?

1202
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,520
We shared a taxi, remember?

1203
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,320
You made me feel...

1204
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,560
an age old, burdened, sour...

1205
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,320
Even superior.

1206
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:43,280
That was <i>the miscalculation of my life.</i>

1207
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,720
You, Aubrey...

1208
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,160
are my most complete man.

1209
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,320
You're brave...

1210
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,360
compassionate...

1211
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,440
kind.

1212
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,600
A content man.

1213
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,800
That's your secret.

1214
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,960
Contentment.

1215
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,120
I'm 24 and I've never known it.

1216
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,760
I'm forever in pursuit and I don't
even know what it is I'm chasing.

1217
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,520
Aubrey, old chap, I'm scared.

1218
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:26,560
Sam and I, we've laboured,
rowed and bullied for this.

1219
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,080
Day in, day out.

1220
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:33,200
You've seen us -
chuckled over us, I'll be bound.

1221
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,240
Out in all weathers.

1222
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,400
Madmen.

1223
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,920
And for what?

1224
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,200
I was beaten out of sight in the 200.

1225
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:47,120
Then I let Paddock trick me in the semi.

1226
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,080
Now, in one hour's time,
I'll be out there again.

1227
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:56,480
I'll raise my eyes
and look down that corridor...

1228
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:01,280
four-feet wide with ten lonely seconds
to justify my whole existence.

1229
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,040
But will I?

1230
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,320
Aubrey, I've known the fear of losing.

1231
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,520
But now I'm almost too frightened to win.

1232
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,800
<i>Dear Mr Abrahams.</i>

1233
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,400
<i>You must please pardon</i>
<i>my not coming to see you run...</i>

1234
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,760
<i>much as I would like to do so.</i>

1235
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:36,920
<i>However, I believe and hope you will win...</i>

1236
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,080
<i>the 100 metres.</i>

1237
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,720
<i>Go out determined to do your best.</i>

1238
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,680
<i>And don't forget...</i>

1239
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,680
<i>drop down at the first stride.</i>

1240
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,400
<i>Get well warmed up...</i>

1241
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,760
<i>and then let the gun release you.</i>

1242
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:58,320
<i>I should use the springy old six-spike shoes.</i>

1243
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,040
<i>All the best of luck.</i>

1244
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,240
<i>From yours truly, Sam Mussabini.</i>

1245
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:11,280
<i>PS. Please accept the charm.</i>

1246
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,920
<i>My old father swore by it.</i>

1247
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:22,400
No regrets, Eric,
that you're not down there with them?

1248
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,720
Yeah.

1249
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,840
No doubts, though.

1250
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:34,000
Your Royal Highness, may I present
Mr Bowman of the United States?

1251
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,960
Mr Bowman.

1252
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:38,320
- Mr Murchison.
- Mr Murchison.

1253
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:41,520
And Mr Watson of New Zealand
I believe you know.

1254
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,240
- Oh, yes, Mr Watson. How are you?
- Very well, sir.

1255
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,720
Good.

1256
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:48,760
- Mr Paddock.
- Mr Paddock.

1257
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:52,120
Dinner for your whole team at my club
when we get back to London.

1258
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:56,040
Now if you win, I pay,
Abrahams wins, you pay, all right?

1259
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,120
Sir, you have yourself a deal.

1260
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,560
Done.

1261
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,840
- The best of luck to you.
- And to you, sir.

1262
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,040
- Mr Scholz.
- Scholz.

1263
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,320
And this is our Harold Abrahams.

1264
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,600
- Good luck, Abrahams.
- Thank you, sir.

1265
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,960
Do your best. That's all we can expect.

1266
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:17,440
- Good luck, Abrahams.
- Thank you, sir.

1267
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,840
Come on, Charlie!

1268
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,040
Charlie, Charlie, rah rah rah!

1269
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,720
<i>Prêt!</i>

1270
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,560
Head down.

1271
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,760
<i>Watch the first stride.</i>

1272
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:06,720
<i>Go for release.</i>

1273
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,920
<i>Premier...</i>

1274
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,120
<i>numéro 419.</i>

1275
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,920
<i>Abrahams, Grande Bretagne.</i>

1276
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:40,560
<i>Temps, 10 secondes, trois cinquièmes.</i>

1277
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:44,400
<i>Second, 74.</i>

1278
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,560
<i>Scholz, ةtats Unis.</i>

1279
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,680
Harold!

1280
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,480
My son.

1281
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,360
- Harold!
- Ssh, ssh, ssh!

1282
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,560
Leave him be. The poor fella's whacked.

1283
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:25,080
- But he won!
- Exactly.

1284
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:28,520
One of these days, Monty,
you're going to win yourself.

1285
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,080
And it's pretty difficult to swallow.

1286
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:40,040
Come in.

1287
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:43,360
Mrs Abrahams just rang, miss.

1288
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,520
The <i>Daily Express.</i>
They've been on from Paris.

1289
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,480
Mr 'Arold. He won!

1290
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,480
She told me to tell you he won!

1291
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,120
Thank you very much, Bill.

1292
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:59,440
Oh, it's 15 minutes to curtain-up, miss.

1293
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,160
He did it, sir.

1294
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,160
Thank you, Matthews.

1295
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,520
"Abrahams triumphant."

1296
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,280
"Caius College athlete
wins blue riband at Games."

1297
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,880
Just as I expected.

1298
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:48,640
<i>Yes, you've always thought</i>
of yourself as a ruthless man. Hard.

1299
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,640
Bit of a loner, like me.

1300
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:55,160
But actually,
you're as soft as a limp pocket.

1301
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,920
Oh, you care.

1302
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,400
Care about things that really matter.

1303
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:08,040
If you didn't, I wouldn't have come
within a mile of you.

1304
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:15,000
Do you know who you won for
out there today?

1305
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,800
Us!

1306
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,840
You and old Sam Mussabini.

1307
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,640
I've waited 30 bloody years for this.

1308
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,800
<i>Pardon, messieurs. Il faut partir maintenant.</i>

1309
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,800
<i>Il est trois heures du matin.</i>

1310
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:32,880
Oh!

1311
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:36,760
Harold!

1312
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:41,040
It means the world to me, this, you know.

1313
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,480
And if all the world can do...

1314
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:49,120
is to want to go home to bed,
then they can go to hell!

1315
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,640
Because we've had today...

1316
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,680
you and me...

1317
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:56,840
and we've got it for keeps.

1318
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,120
So now it's out o' yer system...

1319
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:03,960
go home to that girl o' yours
and start some bloody living.

1320
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:05,720
Yes?

1321
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,120
- To Sam Mussabini.
- Oh.

1322
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:22,000
The greatest trainer in the world.

1323
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,120
Hm?

1324
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,280
<i>Tell him. Get some more.</i>

1325
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:36,920
<i>Come on, Sam. We're going home.</i>

1326
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,080
<i>The final of the 400 metres.</i>

1327
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:06,520
<i>Taylor. ةtats Unis.</i>

1328
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:09,440
<i>Numéro 278.</i>

1329
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:13,240
Good luck. Don't expect
I'll see you till after the race.

1330
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:21,400
What's the deal with this guy Liddell?
Is he a problem?

1331
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:23,560
No problem. He's a flyer.

1332
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:26,400
He's had two races today already. He'll die.

1333
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:30,360
Just swing along, you guys, and wait.

1334
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:35,440
After 300 metres, rigor mortis sets in.

1335
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,640
You'll pull him in on a rope.

1336
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,640
Good luck, Taylor.

1337
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:47,240
- Watch out for Liddell.
- Coach says no problem.

1338
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,480
He's got something personal to prove.

1339
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,320
Something guys like Coach'll
never understand.

1340
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,520
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1341
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,680

01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,240
I will honour."

1345
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:23,000

<i>So where does the power come from...</i>

1349
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:58,600
<i>to see the race to its end?</i>

1350
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:00,240
<i>From within.</i>

1351
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,880

<i>But he also made me fast.</i>

01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,480
<i>And when I run...</i>

1356
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,640
