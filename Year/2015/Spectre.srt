1
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,613
Where are you going?

2
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:57,217
I won't be long.

3
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,434
Welcome, Signor Soiarra.

4
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,998
I trust you had a pleasant journey.

5
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,250
Do you have it?

6
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,840
Yes. It's over there.

7
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,032
When do we blow the stadium?

8
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,438
This evening at six.

9
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,512
And the flight out of here?

10
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,194
All arranged.

11
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,635
And then what?

12
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,000
Then I visit The Pale King.

13
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,799
A toast, my friend.

14
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,878
To Death!

15
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,397
Bottoms up.

16
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,472
Meet me in the square!

17
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,213
Start anywhere you like.

18
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,990
Take your time, 007, but in five minutes
the head of the Joint Security Service

19
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,693
is going to walk through that door,
and I've got to explain to him

20
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:54,031
how one of our agents decided
to potter off to Mexico,

21
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:56,665
all on his own, and cause
an international incident.

22
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,967
With all due respect, sir,
it could've been worse.

23
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,103
Worse? You blew up half a bloody block.

24
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,779
Well, better half a block
than a whole stadium full of people.

25
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,541
You had no authority.

26
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:09,845
None. As you know, we're in
the middle of the biggest shakeup

27
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,380
in the history of British intelligence.

28
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,116
The ink's barely dry
on this merger with MI5

29
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:17,886
and already they're itching for a chance
to scrap the double-0 program forever.

30
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,171
And you've just given them one.

31
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,958
You're right, sir.

32
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,425
You have got a tricky day ahead.

33
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:30,899
This is an official question.

34
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:35,070
Mexico City. What were you doing there?

35
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,073
It was just a coincidence.
I was taking some overdue holiday.

36
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,145
Okay. Fine.

37
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,981
As of this morning,
you are officially grounded.

38
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:49,689
I'm standing you down
from all operations indefinitely.

39
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:00,093
Very good, sir.

40
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,328
007?

41
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:04,833
Sir?

42
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:09,237
I don't know what you're playing at,
but whatever it is, it has to stop.

43
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:11,136
Now.

44
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,343
- So sorry. Am I interrupting?
- Not remotely.

45
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:18,046
007, I'd like you to meet Max Denbigh,
head of the Joint Security Service.

46
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:21,950
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, 007.
I've heard a lot about you. Most of it good.

47
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,652
- Congratulations on your new appointment.
- Thank you.

48
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:28,190
- I suppose we should call you C now.
- No, no. "Max," please.

49
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,898
No, I think I'll call you C... C.

50
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,095
As you wish.

51
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:38,524
Well, my door is always open, 007,
for my employees.

52
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:40,836
This merger's gonna be
a whole new chapter for us.

53
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:44,448
We're going to bring British intelligence
out of the Dark Ages...

54
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,442
into the light.

55
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,577
That all sounds lovely.

56
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:52,884
That'll be all, 007. Report to Q
tomorrow for medical, thank you.

57
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:54,768
Very good, sir.

58
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,062
- James?
- Moneypenny.

59
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:11,633
- So? How was the meeting?
- Very good, thank you.

60
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:15,170
- Here. Forensics finally released this.
- What is it?

61
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,072
It's personal effects
they recovered from Skyfall.

62
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:20,678
- Perfect. You can bring it to me later.
- What do you mean?

63
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,109
My place, 9:00.

64
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:38,062
- Evening.
- Come in.

65
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:42,453
- Have you just moved in?
- No.

66
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:45,964
Well, I like what you've done
with the place.

67
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,658
Your delivery.

68
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:50,620
Thank you.

69
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:56,578
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm not staying.

70
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:58,544
That's a shame.

71
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,913
What's going on, James?

72
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:04,886
There's not one person at MI6
who isn't talking about it.

73
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:08,123
Talking about what, exactly?

74
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:12,127
That what you did in Mexico
was one step too far.

75
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:15,631
- That you're finished.
- And what do you think?

76
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:18,098
I think you're just getting started.

77
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,403
I don't know what you mean.

78
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:23,436
All right.

79
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,709
I think you've got a secret.

80
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,012
And it's something you won't tell anyone.

81
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:32,855
Because you don't trust anyone.

82
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,795
<i>If anything happens to me, 007,
I need you to do something.</i>

83
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:52,198
<i>Find a man called Marco Sciarra.</i>

84
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:54,435
<i>Kill him.</i>

85
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:57,036
<i>And don't miss the funeral.</i>

86
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:01,507
Jesus.

87
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,056
- Where did you get it?
- In my mailbox just after she died.

88
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:09,915
Well, she was never short of surprises.

89
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:13,819
She wasn't gonna let death
get in the way of her job.

90
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:16,978
I've been tracking Sciarra ever since.

91
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:20,695
- And what have you found?
- Nothing significant yet.

92
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:23,029
When's the funeral?

93
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:25,600
Three days. In Rome.

94
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,690
If you think M's signing off
on that, you're insane.

95
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,607
- He won't let you out of his sight.
- Yes, it's a bit of a problem.

96
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:37,612
Listen... could you do
a little quiet digging for me?

97
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:41,313
I heard a name in Mexico. "The Pale King."

98
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:45,718
You want me to be your mole.

99
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,720
Yes.

100
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,609
And what makes you think you can trust me?

101
00:21:55,193 --> 00:21:56,796
Instinct.

102
00:22:57,091 --> 00:23:01,160
Poor old girl.
Rigged for demolition in a week.

103
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:04,644
Cheaper to knock her down than to rebuild.

104
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,234
Still.

105
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:09,300
Time waits for no man and all that.

106
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:13,305
Anyway, all the money's
been spent on this...

107
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,476
the New Centre for National Security.

108
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:20,198
So that's C's new digs.

109
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,766
You've met him, have you?

110
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:26,287
- Yesterday. What do we know about him?
- Classic Whitehall mandarin.

111
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:29,591
Wrote a dossier last year on how
the double-0 program was obsolete,

112
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:32,927
how drones could do
all our dirty work abroad.

113
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:36,097
- Went to school with the Home Secretary.
- Of course, he did.

114
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:38,433
This merger's just the start of it.

115
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:43,204
In three days, there's a security conference
in Tokyo to decide the New World Order.

116
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:45,473
If C gets his way,
he'll have unlimited access

117
00:23:45,573 --> 00:23:48,396
to the combined the intelligence
streams of nine countries.

118
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:50,394
Including us.

119
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,206
Quite.

120
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:02,536
Well, a lot's happened
while you were away.

121
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:06,694
A train bombing in Hamburg
and an industrial explosion in Tunisia.

122
00:24:06,794 --> 00:24:10,966
It's not great timing for us.
It's all rather playing into C's hands.

123
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:15,437
M, well, let's say
he's feeling the pressure.

124
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,805
Yeah, I've noticed.

125
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:21,403
Now, this way, 007.
Be careful. It's a trifle slippery.

126
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:27,449
Q wasn't exactly feeling at home
in Whitehall, what with the new merger,

127
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,773
so he set up shop here,
away from prying eyes, as it were.

128
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:34,655
I hear he's got something
rather special planned for you.

129
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:36,929
I can hardly wait.

130
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,571
007.

131
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:51,940
- Q.
- Please excuse the mess.

132
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,790
Everything's a little bit up in the air,
what with the changes and all.

133
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,398
Couple of things to get through.

134
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,982
Shall we get started?

135
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:02,515
Just relax.

136
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:06,688
That's it. Lovely.
Now, you may feel a small...

137
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:09,322
- Christ!
- ...prick.

138
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:14,429
- What is it?
- Cutting-edge nanotechnology.

139
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:16,770
Smart Blood.

140
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:22,486
Microchips in your bloodstream. Allows us
to track your movements in the field.

141
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,706
You see those readouts?

142
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:28,543
We can monitor your vital signs
from anywhere on the planet.

143
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:31,077
Well, that sounds marvelous.

144
00:25:31,177 --> 00:25:34,031
Call it a post-Mexico insurance policy.

145
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,615
By direct order of M.

146
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:39,552
I completely understand.

147
00:25:41,222 --> 00:25:43,040
Good.

148
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:46,109
Right. Well, I've just...

149
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,928
got one last thing for you
and you can be on your way.

150
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,005
Magnificent, isn't she?

151
00:25:58,105 --> 00:26:01,487
Zero to 60 in three point two seconds.
Fully bulletproof.

152
00:26:01,587 --> 00:26:04,241
A few little tricks up her sleeve.

153
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:10,202
It's a shame, really. She was meant for you,
but she's been reassigned to 009.

154
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:13,276
But you can have this.

155
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:21,997
- Does it do anything?
- It tells the time.

156
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:24,885
- Might help with your punctuality issues.
- M's idea?

157
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,799
Precisely.

158
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:31,904
Oh, one word of warning.
The alarm is rather loud.

159
00:26:32,106 --> 00:26:35,675
- If you know what I mean.
- I think I do.

160
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:44,453
Oh, yes. That old thing
is taking quite a bit of time.

161
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:49,156
Mind you, there wasn't much left
to work on. Only a steering wheel.

162
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:53,693
I believe I said, "Bring it back in one
piece," not, "Bring back one piece."

163
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,954
Anyway, enjoy your downtime, 007.

164
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:06,308
- Q?
- Yes?

165
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:11,009
Well, now you know exactly
where I am all of the time.

166
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,963
- Will you do something for me?
- What do you have in mind, exactly?

167
00:27:16,817 --> 00:27:19,135
Make me disappear.

168
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:24,825
May I remind you
that I answer directly to M.

169
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,762
I also have a mortgage.
And two cats to feed.

170
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:30,999
Well, then I suggest you trust me...

171
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:32,832
for the sake of the cats.

172
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:40,841
Well, it's lovely to see you, 007. Lovely.

173
00:27:40,941 --> 00:27:42,043
Now, I meant to tell you,

174
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:45,847
the Smart Blood program is obviously
still in its developmental phase.

175
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:51,450
So we may experience the odd drop
in coverage during the first 24 hours...

176
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,324
48 hours after administration,

177
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,222
but after that it should work perfectly.

178
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:03,966
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Please, don't.

179
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:36,464
- Morning. What's that?
- Oh, it's just something from an admirer.

180
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:39,665
- It's not your birthday, is it?
- No, sir.

181
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:42,576
That was last week.

182
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:43,905
Morning.

183
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:47,842
009 has arrived to pick up the DB10, sir.
He's waiting upstairs.

184
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,698
Oh, good. Yes, fine.

185
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:06,617
Oh, shit.

186
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,987
I'm sorry for your loss.

187
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:17,993
- You knew my husband?
- All too briefly.

188
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:22,063
- What do you do?
- Life insurance.

189
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:24,619
A little late for that.

190
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:28,940
For your husband, yes. But what about you?

191
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:31,025
Me?

192
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:35,674
I hear the life expectancy
of some widows can be very short.

193
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:39,080
How can you talk like this?

194
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,182
Can't you see I'm grieving?

195
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:43,650
No.

196
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,424
What a lovely view.

197
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,262
You're wasting your time.

198
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:11,899
There are 100 more
that will come after me.

199
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:15,835
All you buy me is five minutes.

200
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,899
Excellent. Time for a drink.

201
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,319
You killed him...

202
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:34,488
didn't you? My husband.

203
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:39,171
He was an assassin.
Trust me, he won't take it personally.

204
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,883
You signed my death warrant.
I was respected.

205
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:49,137
- Loyal to a man you hated.
- He trusted my silence.

206
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,472
With him gone, I'm a dead woman.

207
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:53,855
- I can trust nobody.
- I know the feeling well.

208
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:56,460
Well, I can tell you
that I don't trust you.

209
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,363
Well, then you have impeccable instincts.

210
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:02,347
If you don't leave now,
we'll die together.

211
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:06,819
I can think of worse ways to go.

212
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:12,406
Then you're obviously crazy, Mister...

213
00:35:13,393 --> 00:35:15,227
Bond.

214
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:19,056
James Bond.

215
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,741
These people...

216
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,993
if you just knew what they could do.

217
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:36,951
The power they have.

218
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:40,723
Did your husband ever mention
"The Pale King?"

219
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:43,097
No.

220
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:46,683
The organization...

221
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,345
they hardly ever meet.

222
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:55,719
But because of what happened
to my husband,

223
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:58,989
- they meet tonight.
- Why?

224
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:01,826
To choose a replacement.

225
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,792
Where?

226
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,165
The Palazzo Cardenza.

227
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:11,179
- Midnight.
- Sounds like fun. I might drop by.

228
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,338
He was obsessed.

229
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:18,573
He spent more time with them than with me.

230
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,198
Then the man was a fool.

231
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,759
Leaving your number?

232
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:38,896
I've called an American
friend of mine. Felix.

233
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,632
He'll contact his embassy
and get you out of here.

234
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,865
You'll be safe.

235
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,865
Don't go, James.

236
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:58,490
If you go there, you're crossing over
to a place where there is no mercy.

237
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,649
I have to go.

238
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:04,838
Bona fortuna, Dona Lucia.

239
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,591
Identify yourself, asshole.

240
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,157
Who are you?

241
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm Mickey Mouse. Who are you?

242
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:24,534
...pharmacy sites has provided
an excellent new sales platform.

243
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:29,173
We have adapted many of them into
clearinghouses for unapproved drugs.

244
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,807
In addition to which,

245
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:36,580
the latest figures show that we presently
control 70% of antimalarial vaccines,

246
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,052
34% of H.I.V., and 40%
of all oncological drugs

247
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,054
across Sub-Saharan Africa.

248
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:47,791
But we face challenges from the WHO

249
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:51,596
in their campaign against
our counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

250
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:56,108
We have now identified
the key individuals to target.

251
00:38:56,283 --> 00:39:00,502
We expect the same success as we had
against the Council on Human Trafficking.

252
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,890
Since the board's resignation...

253
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:10,030
we have placed 160,000 migrated females
into the leisure sector.

254
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,770
The impending completion
of the Global Surveillance initiative...

255
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:18,370
will mean our capability
is second to none...

256
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:23,192
and now is the moment
for aggressive expansion.

257
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,234
The news is only good...

258
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,172
Don't let me interrupt you.

259
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,032
The news is only good...

260
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,810
Our increased surveillance capability...

261
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,610
means government intelligence agencies...

262
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,690
are easily counteracted.

263
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,396
We are winning.

264
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:30,428
Thank you, Doctor.
Now, on to the matter at hand.

265
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:34,264
After the success of our attacks
in Hamburg and Tunisia,

266
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:36,767
the aborted attack in Mexico City

267
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:40,771
and the death of our valued colleague,
Marco Sciarra,

268
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:44,241
leaves one of his duties outstanding.

269
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,545
Signor Guerra, The Pale King
must be terminated.

270
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,146
Will you make the journey to Altaussee?

271
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,890
Of course.

272
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,730
My loyalty to this organization is total.

273
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:02,050
I will protect it with my last breath.

274
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,730
There will be no more...

275
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,410
amateurs.

276
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,117
No more shows of weakness.

277
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:49,752
Does anyone challenge
Signor Guerra for this position?

278
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:19,001
Welcome. State your credentials
for succeeding Signor Sciarra.

279
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,023
It's funny.

280
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:21,814
All that excitement in Mexico City
rang a distant bell.

281
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:25,199
And now...

282
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:30,004
suddenly, this evening,
it makes perfect sense.

283
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,457
Welcome, James.

284
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,484
It's been a long time.

285
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:46,391
But, finally, here we are.

286
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:52,360
What took you so long?

287
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,221
Cuckoo.

288
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:06,741
Ciao, Mickey Mouse.

289
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,262
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

290
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,240
No.

291
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:55,806
Moneypenny.

292
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:01,087
- Bond?
- Listen, Moneypenny.

293
00:47:01,187 --> 00:47:03,720
Hamburg, Tunisia, Mexico City,
they're all linked.

294
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,590
It's one organization
coordinating multiple attacks.

295
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,226
- So, she was right.
- <i>Of course, she was.</i>

296
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,307
- I ran that check.
- Who is it?

297
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:16,839
Oh, my boss had his credit card stolen.
It's nothing.

298
00:47:16,939 --> 00:47:19,256
- Why don't you go back to sleep.
- Don't be long.

299
00:47:19,356 --> 00:47:20,870
- Who was that?
- <i>No one.</i>

300
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,620
- <i>No, it wasn't.</i>
- It's just a friend.

301
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,875
At this time of night?

302
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,706
It's called life, James.
You should try it sometime.

303
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:38,724
<i>The Pale King. It looks like you've had
dealings with him before. Quantum.</i>

304
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:41,558
- Of course. Mr. White!
- <i>That's him.</i>

305
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:47,064
Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria, four months ago.

306
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:49,597
Hold that thought.

307
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:03,413
- You still there?
- Yeah.

308
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:06,917
- Run another name, will you?
- Okay. Go.

309
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:10,718
A man called Franz Oberhauser. He's...

310
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:15,392
And check his files
before and after his death.

311
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,227
After his death?
What are you talking about?

312
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,605
Please, just do it.

313
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,879
Okay, Q, give me something.

314
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,161
That's more like it.

315
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,069
Here goes nothing.

316
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,240
Good evening.

317
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:06,062
Do not let them tell you
we need less surveillance.

318
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:09,866
We need more. Much more.

319
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:13,636
I say again, the Nine Eyes committee
would have full access

320
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:17,040
to the combined intelligence streams
of all member states.

321
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,809
More data, more analysis,

322
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:23,361
less likelihood of a terrorist attack.

323
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:28,782
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for
the security services of the world to unite.

324
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,988
Alone, we are weak.

325
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:35,180
Together, we're a global power.

326
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,058
An unelected one.

327
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:40,611
Thank you.

328
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,932
Thank you.

329
00:51:43,032 --> 00:51:45,102
We will now vote on the resolution.

330
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,842
Ladies and gentlemen,
please cast your vote.

331
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,179
The vote is eight to one in favor.

332
00:51:56,279 --> 00:52:01,317
However, as you know, we cannot
proceed unless by unanimous vote.

333
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:04,245
The Nine Eyes motion
is therefore not passed.

334
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,155
Democracy.

335
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:10,324
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
This evening's session is adjourned.

336
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,711
- Yes, sir.
- Please, tell me 007 is in London.

337
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:32,749
Oh, yes. I'll just take a look now, sir.

338
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,883
Because if he isn't, you're in deep shit.

339
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,268
<i>You've got precisely 10 seconds.</i>

340
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:45,128
I have him, sir.
He appears to be in Chelsea.

341
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,531
Well, I want eyes on him
when I get back, understood?

342
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:51,499
I completely understand...

343
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,634
sir.

344
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:48,411
Do me a favor. Make it quick.

345
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:50,995
Upstairs, Mr. White.

346
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:06,459
I always knew death would wear
a familiar face, but not yours.

347
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,964
To what do I owe this pleasure, Mr. Bond?

348
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:16,039
I was at a meeting recently
and your name came up.

349
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:19,111
I'm flattered London
is still talking about me.

350
00:56:19,311 --> 00:56:21,578
It wasn't MI6.

351
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,077
It was Rome.

352
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,147
Your team, not mine.

353
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:36,927
Last month, I found thallium
in my cell phone.

354
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:42,262
It's done its job.
I have a few weeks. Maybe less.

355
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,903
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,

356
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,823
two dead men enjoying the evening.

357
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:53,710
- What did you do?
- I disobeyed him.

358
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:58,241
I followed him as far as I could. He...

359
00:56:58,341 --> 00:57:01,884
- changed.
- Oh, I see.

360
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:03,568
You grew a conscience.

361
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:07,888
Our game is our game. But this?

362
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,677
Women, children...

363
00:57:10,777 --> 00:57:14,230
Well, the thallium would suggest that
he doesn't like you very much anymore.

364
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,349
And clearly the feeling is mutual.

365
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,568
So why don't you tell me
how to find him again?

366
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,670
Oh, come on.

367
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,173
- Tell me where he is.
- He's everywhere.

368
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:26,933
Everywhere! He's sitting at your desk,

369
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:31,045
he's kissing your lover,
he's eating supper with your family!

370
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:40,955
You're protecting someone.

371
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,623
Your wife.

372
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:48,498
She left long ago.

373
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,631
Your son?

374
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,736
Your daughter.

375
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,877
You won't find her. She's clever.

376
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:04,323
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.

377
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,549
I can protect her
if you tell me where he is.

378
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:15,088
- I can keep her alive.
- Yeah.

379
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:20,427
- You have my word.
- Your word?

380
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:23,196
The word of an assassin!

381
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,454
That's my word.

382
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,890
L'Americain.

383
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:11,412
You save her, she can lead you to
L'Americain. She knows L'Americain.

384
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:15,115
Try the Hoffler Klinik.

385
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:26,019
You're a kite dancing
in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.

386
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:30,223
So long.

387
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:26,823
I can't deny I'm impressed you got
H.M.G. to cough up for all this.

388
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,259
Good God, the government
couldn't afford this kind of facility.

389
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,128
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.

390
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:35,398
When it goes online, this building
will be the most sophisticated

391
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:40,736
data gathering system in history.
The world's digital ghost, available 24/7.

392
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:43,695
- George Orwell's worst nightmare.
- I'm glad you like it.

393
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:48,126
My commiserations on losing
the Nine Eyes vote. Must've been a blow.

394
01:00:48,226 --> 01:00:51,780
Not really. Only a matter of time
before the South Africans see the light.

395
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,152
And you know what they say, Rome wasn't
built in a day. Day and a half maybe.

396
01:00:56,252 --> 01:01:00,020
Look, Max, I know surveillance
is a fact of life.

397
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:05,027
It's how you use the information
that concerns me, and who is using it.

398
01:01:05,127 --> 01:01:08,130
This is what we need to do
to keep the people safe.

399
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,938
Double-0 program is prehistoric.

400
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,802
Come on, M. You can't really tell me
that one man in the field

401
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:18,406
can compete with all of this, running
around out there with his license to kill.

402
01:01:19,408 --> 01:01:21,676
Have you ever had to kill a man, Max?

403
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:27,317
Have you? To pull that trigger,
you have to be sure.

404
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:32,321
Yes, you investigate, analyze,
assess, target.

405
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:35,455
And then you have to look him in the eye.

406
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:37,693
And you make the call.

407
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:41,163
And all the drones, bugs,
cameras, transcripts,

408
01:01:41,263 --> 01:01:43,832
all the surveillance in the world

409
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:46,806
can't tell you what to do next.

410
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:49,739
A license to kill...

411
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:53,057
is also a license not to kill.

412
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,680
I didn't want to have to do this,

413
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,491
but it looks like you still
can't control your agents.

414
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,900
<i>Bond? I ran that check.</i>

415
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,991
<i>Looks like you've had dealings
with him before. Quantum.</i>

416
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:11,093
<i>Of course. Mr. White!</i>

417
01:02:11,193 --> 01:02:14,430
<i>Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria.</i>

418
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,597
<i>Run another name, will you?</i>

419
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:20,601
So maybe there's something to be said
for total surveillance after all.

420
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:25,894
You watch MI6 agents?

421
01:02:27,309 --> 01:02:29,647
We watch everyone.

422
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:39,180
Please, take a seat.
I'll be with you in just a moment.

423
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:58,098
Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.

424
01:03:59,568 --> 01:04:02,071
My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.

425
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:06,542
Our job today is to analyze your needs,
both psychological and physical.

426
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:09,175
Sounds pretty straightforward.

427
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:12,094
I hope you don't mind.
The view can be distracting.

428
01:04:12,194 --> 01:04:13,797
I hadn't noticed.

429
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:22,858
I see you filled out
most of the paperwork.

430
01:04:23,058 --> 01:04:27,563
Just a few questions to complete
your evaluation, if I may.

431
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:31,467
- Do you exercise?
- When I have to.

432
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:34,602
Do you consider your employment
to be psychologically stressful?

433
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:39,574
- Sometimes.
- How much alcohol do you consume?

434
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:40,808
Too much.

435
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:45,347
Some broader questions.

436
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,850
As a child, would you say
you were close to your parents?

437
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,751
My parents died when I was young.

438
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:53,422
Really? How old?

439
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:56,726
- Old enough to remember.
- How, if I may ask?

440
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:58,861
It was a climbing accident.

441
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:02,264
- So who brought you up?
- Someone else.

442
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:04,599
Humor me.

443
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:08,437
How does one train at Oxford
and the Sorbonne become a consultant,

444
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,441
spend two years
with Medecins Sans Frontieres...

445
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,348
and end up here?

446
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,879
Forgive me, but... anyone might think
you were hiding from something.

447
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,818
You're paying a lot of money
to be here, Mr. Bond.

448
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:27,354
- Who's asking the questions, you or me?
- Of course. Carry on.

449
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:33,863
I see you left this final question blank.

450
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,631
What is your occupation?

451
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:39,835
Well, that's not the sort of thing
that looks good on a form.

452
01:05:39,935 --> 01:05:43,202
- And why is that?
- I kill people.

453
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,573
Small world?

454
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:52,148
- Where is he?
- Your father's dead.

455
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:55,650
- Two days ago.
- How do you know?

456
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:58,552
- Because I was there.
- Did you kill him?

457
01:05:58,652 --> 01:06:02,405
I didn't have to. He did it himself.

458
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:06,228
And you came all the way
just to tell me this?

459
01:06:06,828 --> 01:06:08,231
That my father's dead?

460
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:12,301
I came to tell you that your life
is in danger and I need your help.

461
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:16,178
- Why?
- I made a deal with him to protect you.

462
01:06:17,272 --> 01:06:20,740
You're lying. Why would he trust you?

463
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,826
Because he knew that I needed
something in return.

464
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:26,044
And what was that?

465
01:06:26,144 --> 01:06:28,564
To find L'Americain.

466
01:06:29,014 --> 01:06:31,417
- This interview is over.
- Dr. Swann...

467
01:06:31,517 --> 01:06:35,586
You have 10 minutes to leave the building.
Then I'm calling security.

468
01:06:39,491 --> 01:06:42,092
Thank you, Dr. Swann.

469
01:07:03,749 --> 01:07:07,720
- Can I get you something, sir?
- Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

470
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,755
I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol.

471
01:07:10,855 --> 01:07:12,859
I'm really starting to love this place.

472
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:15,528
He'll have the prolytic
digestive enzyme shake.

473
01:07:15,928 --> 01:07:16,845
Certainly.

474
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:20,132
If you've come for the car,
I parked it at the bottom of the Tiber.

475
01:07:20,232 --> 01:07:23,302
Well, not to worry, 007.
It was only a £3,000,000 prototype.

476
01:07:23,402 --> 01:07:26,439
- Why are you here, Q?
- I just fancied a break, to be honest.

477
01:07:26,539 --> 01:07:28,608
I've been a tad stressed at work recently.

478
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:31,841
What with C's people crawling all over us
and the fact that M wants my balls

479
01:07:31,941 --> 01:07:33,684
- for Christmas decorations.
- Get to the point.

480
01:07:33,784 --> 01:07:37,316
The point, 007,
is that Franz Oberhauser is dead.

481
01:07:37,416 --> 01:07:40,286
Dead and buried. And unless
you come back with me right now,

482
01:07:40,386 --> 01:07:43,188
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.

483
01:07:43,288 --> 01:07:45,791
Do you understand? All hell
is breaking loose out there and...

484
01:07:45,891 --> 01:07:48,890
- I saw him.
- You thought you saw him.

485
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,662
We've been through the records.

486
01:07:50,762 --> 01:07:53,165
He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.

487
01:07:53,265 --> 01:07:56,807
Yes. I know that. But I saw him.

488
01:07:59,004 --> 01:08:01,812
He's not someone I'll ever forget.

489
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:06,478
- So you have a lead?
- I have a name. L'Americain.

490
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:11,750
Well, that narrows it down.
Look, I'm sorry, 007, but time's up.

491
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,685
My whole career is on the line here.

492
01:08:13,785 --> 01:08:17,622
Either you come back in and do this through
proper channels, or I go directly to M.

493
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:21,227
Do one more thing for me. Then you're out.

494
01:08:21,327 --> 01:08:24,060
Find out what you can from this.

495
01:08:32,171 --> 01:08:35,992
- I really, really hate you right now.
- Thank you, Q.

496
01:08:36,775 --> 01:08:38,644
Monsieur? Now? Please?

497
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:41,113
- Where are you staying?
- The Pevsner. Room 12.

498
01:08:41,213 --> 01:08:43,279
One hour.

499
01:08:43,748 --> 01:08:47,319
Here you are, sir.
One prolytic digestive enzyme shake.

500
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:51,123
Do me a favor, will you?
Throw that down the toilet.

501
01:08:51,223 --> 01:08:52,638
Cut out the middleman.

502
01:09:01,933 --> 01:09:04,167
No! Stay.

503
01:09:54,252 --> 01:09:56,286
What do you want?

504
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:01,190
What are you doing?

505
01:10:02,027 --> 01:10:04,594
Can't any of you speak?

506
01:13:29,935 --> 01:13:31,610
Come on!

507
01:14:28,076 --> 01:14:30,962
Right, come on. Come on.

508
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:33,365
Don't touch me!

509
01:14:33,965 --> 01:14:37,870
Hey! You need to take a breath
and calm down. You're in shock.

510
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:40,712
Get away from me! Just get away!

511
01:14:40,812 --> 01:14:44,073
Did it cross your mind
that you led them to me?

512
01:14:48,713 --> 01:14:50,515
I haven't got time for this.

513
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:53,852
You need to tell me everything
you know about L'Americain.

514
01:14:54,252 --> 01:14:56,485
Go to hell!

515
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:01,037
I gave your father my word!

516
01:15:02,494 --> 01:15:06,631
And why should I trust you?
Because my father did?

517
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:09,332
Because right now, Dr. Swann...

518
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:13,531
I'm your best chance of staying alive.

519
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:40,633
Dr. Swann, Q. Q, Dr. Swann.

520
01:15:40,965 --> 01:15:43,870
- Hello.
- Enchanted.

521
01:15:44,636 --> 01:15:47,673
Bond, we need to talk. Alone.

522
01:15:47,773 --> 01:15:49,738
- She knows.
- But, Bond...

523
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:52,845
She knows. What have you got?

524
01:15:53,445 --> 01:15:56,077
I owe you an apology, 007.

525
01:15:56,447 --> 01:15:58,516
You are onto something.

526
01:15:58,616 --> 01:16:01,884
Oberhauser is still alive.
The ring proves it.

527
01:16:02,186 --> 01:16:05,457
And it seems they were all
part of one organization.

528
01:16:05,557 --> 01:16:09,361
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra,
your friend Mr. Silva.

529
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:11,563
And do you know who links them all?

530
01:16:11,663 --> 01:16:14,132
- Him.
- Exactly.

531
01:16:14,232 --> 01:16:17,786
This organization,
do you know what it's called?

532
01:16:18,136 --> 01:16:20,831
- No.
- Spectre.

533
01:16:21,974 --> 01:16:24,209
Its name is Spectre.

534
01:16:24,509 --> 01:16:28,044
- How does she know that?
- Because my father was part of it.

535
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,889
Then I think that you ought to see this.

536
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:33,618
<i>You're looking at pictures
from South Africa right now</i>

537
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:38,621
- <i>of what appears to be a huge explosion.</i>
- Q, go back to London.

538
01:16:39,758 --> 01:16:42,627
M's gonna need your help.
And keep tracking me.

539
01:16:42,727 --> 01:16:44,362
I will.

540
01:16:44,462 --> 01:16:47,559
And, Bond, you have to find L'Americain.

541
01:16:47,659 --> 01:16:49,734
He's our only link to Oberhauser.

542
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:52,047
It's not a person.

543
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,730
It's a place.

544
01:17:59,171 --> 01:18:01,203
Thank you.

545
01:18:32,503 --> 01:18:35,304
This is where they spent
their wedding night.

546
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:38,741
They came back every year.

547
01:18:39,244 --> 01:18:41,911
Then they brought me with them, too.

548
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:47,474
He kept coming back,
even after the divorce.

549
01:18:49,887 --> 01:18:52,388
Well, then I'm sorry.

550
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:54,823
What for?

551
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,874
What is it?

552
01:19:12,977 --> 01:19:15,346
It's your inheritance.

553
01:19:15,446 --> 01:19:18,481
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

554
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:21,968
You don't know what you're missing.

555
01:19:30,829 --> 01:19:33,078
This can't be it.

556
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:36,556
Well, here's to your father.

557
01:19:37,168 --> 01:19:42,117
I promised myself I would never
be hurt by that man again.

558
01:19:43,141 --> 01:19:45,677
I cut off all contact.

559
01:19:45,977 --> 01:19:49,975
I didn't want anything to do
with him or his sick life.

560
01:19:50,715 --> 01:19:53,552
And then, with his dying breath...

561
01:19:53,652 --> 01:19:56,051
he sends me you.

562
01:19:56,587 --> 01:20:00,552
- Ironic, no?
- You shouldn't be so hard on him.

563
01:20:00,892 --> 01:20:03,995
The man I just met
should have been dead weeks ago.

564
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,933
The only reason his heart
was still beating was you.

565
01:20:07,999 --> 01:20:11,900
I'll mourn my father
in my own time, Mr. Bond.

566
01:20:12,037 --> 01:20:15,270
And, now, I'm going to bed.

567
01:20:21,813 --> 01:20:26,499
Don't think for one moment
this is where I fall into your arms,

568
01:20:26,918 --> 01:20:30,943
seeking solace for my dead daddy.

569
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:37,366
You sit there. Keep watch.

570
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:39,849
That's what you're good at.

571
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:46,819
Come anywhere near me and I'll kill you.

572
01:20:46,919 --> 01:20:48,444
I don't doubt it.

573
01:20:59,283 --> 01:21:02,350
Look. There are two of you.

574
01:21:03,588 --> 01:21:06,021
Two Jameses.

575
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:08,710
Lucky me.

576
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:15,591
What am I doing here?

577
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:26,130
To liars...

578
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:28,198
and killers.

579
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:30,450
To liars...

580
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:32,530
and killers...

581
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,632
everywhere.

582
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:08,484
Who sent you?

583
01:22:11,823 --> 01:22:14,560
Who are you working for?

584
01:22:51,295 --> 01:22:53,836
Now, where did you go?

585
01:23:22,259 --> 01:23:24,260
Of course.

586
01:24:46,878 --> 01:24:49,044
What is it?

587
01:24:51,115 --> 01:24:52,982
Nothing.

588
01:25:06,898 --> 01:25:10,966
- What's this?
- It's coordinates.

589
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:16,074
Your father was scanning
for a particular satellite phone.

590
01:25:16,174 --> 01:25:18,527
He was looking for someone.

591
01:25:20,177 --> 01:25:22,583
He was looking for him.

592
01:25:23,714 --> 01:25:26,332
And he sent me here to finish the job.

593
01:25:28,286 --> 01:25:31,319
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

594
01:25:31,422 --> 01:25:34,258
- I like you alive.
- I can look after myself.

595
01:25:34,358 --> 01:25:36,585
That's beside the point.

596
01:25:37,562 --> 01:25:39,430
I might not be coming back.

597
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:41,599
I know.

598
01:25:41,699 --> 01:25:45,001
But I want to understand
what happened to my father.

599
01:26:03,087 --> 01:26:05,900
So, where was he going?

600
01:26:08,826 --> 01:26:10,859
Nowhere.

601
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:25,377
Thank you so much. Thanks.
All the very best.

602
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:26,511
What's going on?

603
01:26:26,611 --> 01:26:28,482
The meeting was brought forward.
Did you not get the message?

604
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:30,928
- No, we didn't.
- Shortest meeting I can remember.

605
01:26:31,148 --> 01:26:34,919
- South Africans on board, I take it?
- Yeah, well, who can blame them?

606
01:26:35,019 --> 01:26:37,155
Nine Eyes is now officially sanctioned.

607
01:26:37,255 --> 01:26:39,691
The new system goes live
in less than 72 hours.

608
01:26:39,791 --> 01:26:43,628
It's a major step forward. Global
intelligence cooperation changes everything.

609
01:26:43,728 --> 01:26:46,161
As you said before.

610
01:26:47,365 --> 01:26:49,263
Look.

611
01:26:49,363 --> 01:26:51,489
They've asked me
to head the new committee.

612
01:26:51,589 --> 01:26:53,524
Yes? And?

613
01:26:53,624 --> 01:26:57,128
And I should tell you I've spoken
with the Home Secretary.

614
01:26:57,228 --> 01:26:59,964
And in light of the new information
I've given him,

615
01:27:00,064 --> 01:27:03,167
he's decided to close down
the double-0 program with immediate effect.

616
01:27:03,567 --> 01:27:08,766
- You don't know what you're doing.
- It's not personal. It's the future.

617
01:27:08,866 --> 01:27:10,672
And...

618
01:27:12,877 --> 01:27:16,511
- You're not.
- You're a cocky little bastard, aren't you?

619
01:27:17,748 --> 01:27:21,283
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- I wouldn't.

620
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,798
This isn't over yet.

621
01:27:41,739 --> 01:27:44,969
- Would you press this for me? Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

622
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:06,228
Pick it up.

623
01:28:06,664 --> 01:28:08,165
I hate guns.

624
01:28:08,565 --> 01:28:10,935
I promised him I'd protect you.

625
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:13,738
The first thing to do is to teach you
how to protect yourself.

626
01:28:13,938 --> 01:28:16,207
What if I shoot you by mistake?

627
01:28:16,307 --> 01:28:18,925
Wouldn't be the first time.

628
01:28:19,025 --> 01:28:22,245
- Pick it up.
- I said, I hate guns.

629
01:28:28,018 --> 01:28:33,288
SIG 226. Front sight. Rear sight. Hammer.

630
01:28:38,296 --> 01:28:43,001
You just point it. You squeeze the trigger.
You try not to close your eyes.

631
01:28:43,501 --> 01:28:45,553
Please...

632
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:47,746
try it.

633
01:29:11,395 --> 01:29:14,063
I don't have to teach you anything, do I?

634
01:29:16,066 --> 01:29:19,703
A man once came to our house
to kill my father.

635
01:29:19,803 --> 01:29:22,940
He didn't know I was upstairs
playing in my bedroom.

636
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,243
Or that Papa kept
a Beretta Nine-millimeter

637
01:29:25,343 --> 01:29:28,107
under the sink with the bleach.

638
01:29:31,015 --> 01:29:32,979
That's why I hate guns.

639
01:29:34,185 --> 01:29:36,808
I think we'll skip hand-to-hand combat.

640
01:29:54,538 --> 01:29:57,876
Good evening, sir. Sorry to interrupt
your supper, but we have some news.

641
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,443
Evening, sir.

642
01:29:59,543 --> 01:30:04,714
Using the Smart Blood, I've tracked Bond
to a point here in North Africa.

643
01:30:05,883 --> 01:30:08,519
See, every known map
registers it as empty desert.

644
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:12,790
Exactly. But if you look at the satellite
blowup, you can clearly see this.

645
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:15,223
We can't help him.

646
01:30:15,626 --> 01:30:18,359
But, sir, we know where he's heading.

647
01:30:18,963 --> 01:30:23,632
C is watching everything we do.
We're only handing them more information.

648
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:29,239
Sir, we can't just desert Bond.

649
01:30:29,339 --> 01:30:32,844
- We have to. We only make him weaker.
- But, sir, we know exactly where he is.

650
01:30:32,944 --> 01:30:36,481
Yes, I know, but if we can
track him, so can others.

651
01:30:36,581 --> 01:30:40,182
Delete all the Smart Blood files.
Everything.

652
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:44,217
He's on his own.

653
01:31:10,014 --> 01:31:14,282
- You shouldn't stare.
- Well, you shouldn't look like that.

654
01:31:17,588 --> 01:31:19,223
May I get you an aperitif?

655
01:31:19,323 --> 01:31:23,834
I'm not sure. It gets me into trouble.
Makes me do crazy things.

656
01:31:23,934 --> 01:31:25,596
Well, we can't have that.

657
01:31:25,696 --> 01:31:29,334
So, I'll have a vodka martini, dirty.

658
01:31:29,634 --> 01:31:32,082
Make that two.

659
01:31:34,705 --> 01:31:37,775
- I have a question.
- Well, what's that?

660
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:41,011
Why, given every other possible option,

661
01:31:41,111 --> 01:31:43,580
does a man choose the life
of a paid assassin?

662
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,528
Well, it was that or the priesthood.

663
01:31:47,685 --> 01:31:50,922
I'm serious. Is this really what you want?

664
01:31:51,022 --> 01:31:55,359
Living in the shadows?
Hunting? Being hunted?

665
01:31:55,459 --> 01:31:58,462
Always looking behind you? Always alone?

666
01:31:58,762 --> 01:32:00,732
But I'm not alone.

667
01:32:00,832 --> 01:32:03,433
Answer the question.

668
01:32:03,734 --> 01:32:06,244
I'm not sure I ever had a choice.

669
01:32:07,558 --> 01:32:09,640
Anyway, I don't stop to think about it.

670
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,855
What would happen if you did?

671
01:32:12,677 --> 01:32:15,310
- Stop?
- Yes.

672
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:21,084
I don't know.

673
01:32:21,184 --> 01:32:25,243
- Your drinks, sir.
- Could you leave them there, please?

674
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:39,036
You know, I think you're wrong.

675
01:32:39,136 --> 01:32:41,169
I am?

676
01:32:41,738 --> 01:32:44,250
We always have a choice.

677
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:48,744
I'll drink to that.

678
01:35:36,313 --> 01:35:38,212
Shit.

679
01:35:45,755 --> 01:35:48,102
What do we do now?

680
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:48,652
This might be a long wait.

681
01:36:51,204 --> 01:36:53,365
Are you having second thoughts?

682
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:56,157
Too late now.

683
01:37:14,879 --> 01:37:17,078
What's that?

684
01:37:31,729 --> 01:37:37,458
That is a 1948 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith.

685
01:38:00,857 --> 01:38:02,690
Please.

686
01:38:24,731 --> 01:38:26,640
I'm scared, James.

687
01:39:10,393 --> 01:39:13,063
Good afternoon, Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.

688
01:39:13,363 --> 01:39:17,133
I want you to know just how excited
we all are to finally meet you.

689
01:39:17,233 --> 01:39:20,137
Well... it's a pleasure to be here.

690
01:39:20,237 --> 01:39:22,522
Your host invites you both to rest,

691
01:39:22,622 --> 01:39:25,526
relax, and join him for drinks at 4:00.

692
01:39:25,676 --> 01:39:27,845
- Tell our host we won't be late.
- Wonderful.

693
01:39:27,945 --> 01:39:32,013
Before we show you to your rooms,
just one more thing.

694
01:39:42,592 --> 01:39:44,317
You be careful with that.

695
01:39:45,128 --> 01:39:47,249
It's loaded.

696
01:39:53,103 --> 01:39:55,136
Thank you.

697
01:40:53,797 --> 01:40:56,368
This is a very special place.

698
01:40:56,468 --> 01:41:00,183
He has requested you enter it alone.

699
01:41:00,283 --> 01:41:02,403
Of course.

700
01:41:04,107 --> 01:41:06,140
Champagne?

701
01:41:06,776 --> 01:41:08,779
Maybe later.

702
01:41:08,879 --> 01:41:10,712
Certainly.

703
01:41:41,744 --> 01:41:44,249
I think we're meant to be impressed.

704
01:41:57,193 --> 01:41:59,260
Touch it.

705
01:42:00,129 --> 01:42:02,654
You can touch it if you want.

706
01:42:04,534 --> 01:42:08,569
- Do you know what it is?
- It's a meteorite.

707
01:42:09,105 --> 01:42:11,441
Yes, exactly.

708
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:15,510
The Kartenhoff.
The oldest in human possession.

709
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:20,214
The very meteorite which made this crater.

710
01:42:21,151 --> 01:42:22,763
Think about it.

711
01:42:22,863 --> 01:42:27,524
So many years up there, alone, silent,

712
01:42:27,624 --> 01:42:32,439
building momentum until it chose
to make its mark on Earth.

713
01:42:33,362 --> 01:42:36,111
A huge, unstoppable force.

714
01:42:36,611 --> 01:42:39,469
Except it did stop, didn't it?

715
01:42:39,569 --> 01:42:41,723
Right here.

716
01:42:55,518 --> 01:42:59,255
I can't tell you how much
I've been looking forward to this.

717
01:42:59,355 --> 01:43:02,123
All of us here, together.

718
01:43:04,327 --> 01:43:05,884
A reunion.

719
01:43:08,064 --> 01:43:11,610
I'm so glad you came, too, dear Madeleine.

720
01:43:12,669 --> 01:43:16,204
You were just a girl when I saw you first.

721
01:43:16,873 --> 01:43:19,925
I came to your home once
to see your father.

722
01:43:22,412 --> 01:43:24,131
I don't remember that.

723
01:43:25,348 --> 01:43:27,447
But I do.

724
01:43:31,338 --> 01:43:32,641
Shall we?

725
01:43:36,659 --> 01:43:40,491
- What is this place?
- Information.

726
01:43:43,266 --> 01:43:45,853
Information is all...

727
01:43:46,503 --> 01:43:48,536
is it not?

728
01:43:48,872 --> 01:43:55,820
For example, you must know by now that
the double-0 program is officially dead.

729
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:00,114
Which leads me to speculate
exactly why you came.

730
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,581
So, James, why did you come?

731
01:44:06,139 --> 01:44:07,793
I came here to kill you.

732
01:44:08,892 --> 01:44:11,161
And I thought you came here to die.

733
01:44:11,461 --> 01:44:14,573
Well, it's all a matter of perspective.

734
01:44:15,098 --> 01:44:17,058
Speaking of perspective.

735
01:44:34,818 --> 01:44:38,946
- Is this live?
- Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.

736
01:44:39,522 --> 01:44:41,658
What an uncanny coincidence.

737
01:44:41,758 --> 01:44:46,063
<i>The French have a saying,
"It's the fate of glass to break."</i>

738
01:44:46,363 --> 01:44:50,400
<i>Well, maybe it's the fate of spies
to just disappear.</i>

739
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:54,938
<i>But with any luck,
we leave something behind.</i>

740
01:44:55,038 --> 01:44:59,048
<i>In the meantime, I'm sure
C will keep you all busy.</i>

741
01:44:59,148 --> 01:45:01,692
<i>Thank you all.</i>

742
01:45:04,614 --> 01:45:08,549
That's touching, don't you think?

743
01:45:10,621 --> 01:45:13,023
Well, James...

744
01:45:13,123 --> 01:45:15,258
it looks like you're all alone.

745
01:45:15,358 --> 01:45:18,559
Not much more than a voyeur, are you?

746
01:45:19,028 --> 01:45:21,364
Too scared to join in.

747
01:45:21,464 --> 01:45:24,534
- I don't think you quite understand.
- Oh, I think I do.

748
01:45:24,634 --> 01:45:27,370
You set cities on fire and watch
innocent people burn,

749
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:32,475
so you can convince governments to join
an intelligence network you've paid for.

750
01:45:32,575 --> 01:45:34,911
Not that complicated.

751
01:45:35,011 --> 01:45:39,413
I'm guessing our little friend, C,
he's one of your disciples.

752
01:45:40,249 --> 01:45:43,752
- You could say that.
- And what does he get out of it?

753
01:45:44,654 --> 01:45:46,489
Nothing.

754
01:45:46,589 --> 01:45:48,391
He's a visionary, like me.

755
01:45:48,491 --> 01:45:50,827
Visionaries.

756
01:45:50,927 --> 01:45:52,759
Psychiatric wards are full of them.

757
01:45:52,859 --> 01:45:55,732
Whereas you couldn't see
what's right in front of you.

758
01:45:55,832 --> 01:46:00,403
You came across me so many times
and yet you never saw me.

759
01:46:00,503 --> 01:46:02,805
Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.

760
01:46:02,905 --> 01:46:05,558
- All dead.
- Yeah, that's right.

761
01:46:05,658 --> 01:46:11,412
A nice pattern developed. You interfered
in my world, I destroyed yours.

762
01:46:12,482 --> 01:46:16,655
Or did you think it was coincidence that
all the women in your life ended up dead?

763
01:46:17,988 --> 01:46:21,093
Vesper Lynd, for example.

764
01:46:21,624 --> 01:46:25,126
She was the big one.
Has he told you about her?

765
01:46:27,364 --> 01:46:31,334
And then, of course, your beloved M.

766
01:46:31,434 --> 01:46:34,201
Gone forever.

767
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:39,507
Me.

768
01:46:40,676 --> 01:46:44,237
It was all me, James. It's always been me.

769
01:46:44,337 --> 01:46:47,582
The author of all your pain.

770
01:46:50,386 --> 01:46:53,450
You're a brave woman, my dear.

771
01:47:00,129 --> 01:47:03,559
Now I understand why
my father lost his mind.

772
01:47:03,659 --> 01:47:06,519
He didn't lose his mind, he was just weak.

773
01:47:06,619 --> 01:47:08,821
But at least he understood
what he was up against.

774
01:47:08,971 --> 01:47:12,211
You see, they failed
to comprehend the crucial fact,

775
01:47:12,311 --> 01:47:16,777
that a terrible event can lead
to something wonderful.

776
01:47:18,415 --> 01:47:21,317
Since you mention your father,
I'll show you.

777
01:47:21,417 --> 01:47:26,053
<i>She's clever. She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.</i>

778
01:47:27,591 --> 01:47:30,524
<i>I can protect her
if you tell me where he is.</i>

779
01:47:32,862 --> 01:47:35,698
- <i>I can keep her alive.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

780
01:47:35,798 --> 01:47:38,935
- <i>You have my word.</i>
- No, no, no. Turn this off.

781
01:47:39,035 --> 01:47:41,337
<i>Your word?</i>

782
01:47:41,437 --> 01:47:44,200
- <i>The word of an assassin!</i>
- Turn this off.

783
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:46,907
- This is important.
- I said turn it off!

784
01:47:48,945 --> 01:47:51,542
I want you to understand something.

785
01:48:01,457 --> 01:48:03,087
<i>That's my word.</i>

786
01:48:04,294 --> 01:48:07,392
Madeleine? Look at me.

787
01:48:08,498 --> 01:48:12,661
Don't look at him, Madeleine. Look at me.

788
01:48:13,803 --> 01:48:16,101
<i>L'Americain.</i>

789
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:18,441
<i>You save her,</i>

790
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:21,543
<i>she can lead you to L'Americain.
She knows L'Americain.</i>

791
01:48:24,313 --> 01:48:27,130
<i>Try the Hoffler Klinik.</i>

792
01:48:32,889 --> 01:48:37,909
<i>You're a kite dancing
in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.</i>

793
01:48:40,396 --> 01:48:42,629
<i>So long.</i>

794
01:48:49,005 --> 01:48:52,678
The things that bring people together.

795
01:48:56,179 --> 01:48:59,767
Out of horror, beauty.

796
01:49:25,574 --> 01:49:28,278
Torture is easy, on a superficial level.

797
01:49:28,378 --> 01:49:31,881
A man can watch himself
being disemboweled and...

798
01:49:31,981 --> 01:49:34,951
derive great horror from the experience,

799
01:49:35,051 --> 01:49:37,753
but it's still going on at a distance.

800
01:49:37,853 --> 01:49:41,024
It isn't taking place where he is.

801
01:49:41,424 --> 01:49:47,463
As you know all too well, dear Madeleine,
a man lives inside his head.

802
01:49:47,563 --> 01:49:51,265
That's where the seat of his soul is.

803
01:49:51,701 --> 01:49:57,640
Now, James and I were both present recently
when a man was deprived of his eyes.

804
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:02,278
And the most astonishing thing happened.
Didn't you notice?

805
01:50:02,878 --> 01:50:05,214
He wasn't there anymore.

806
01:50:05,314 --> 01:50:07,551
He'd gone even though he was still alive.

807
01:50:07,651 --> 01:50:11,721
So in this brief moment
between life and death,

808
01:50:11,821 --> 01:50:15,256
there was nobody inside his skull.

809
01:50:16,092 --> 01:50:18,325
Most odd.

810
01:50:19,461 --> 01:50:20,740
So, James.

811
01:50:22,665 --> 01:50:25,869
I'm going to penetrate...

812
01:50:26,369 --> 01:50:29,238
to where you are.

813
01:50:29,338 --> 01:50:31,673
To the inside of your head.

814
01:50:32,642 --> 01:50:35,879
Now, the first probe
will play with your sight,

815
01:50:35,979 --> 01:50:39,749
your hearing and your balance,

816
01:50:39,849 --> 01:50:42,751
just with the subtlest of manipulations.

817
01:50:42,851 --> 01:50:45,488
Well, get on with it then.

818
01:50:45,588 --> 01:50:49,525
Nothing can be as painful
as listening to you talk.

819
01:50:49,625 --> 01:50:51,761
All right.

820
01:50:51,861 --> 01:50:53,208
Let's begin.

821
01:51:25,928 --> 01:51:28,462
Why are you doing this?

822
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:46,146
You probably know that James here
lost his parents when he was young.

823
01:51:48,585 --> 01:51:51,120
But did you know that it was my father

824
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:54,587
who helped him
through this difficult time?

825
01:52:01,897 --> 01:52:05,836
Over the course of two winters
he taught him to ski,

826
01:52:05,936 --> 01:52:08,771
and climb, and hunt.

827
01:52:08,871 --> 01:52:13,674
He soothed the wounds
of the poor little blue-eyed orphan.

828
01:52:15,945 --> 01:52:19,215
Asked me to treat him as a brother.

829
01:52:19,315 --> 01:52:21,748
My little brother.

830
01:52:22,519 --> 01:52:25,452
They formed quite an attachment.

831
01:52:26,222 --> 01:52:28,058
So...

832
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:30,290
you killed him.

833
01:52:30,793 --> 01:52:32,933
Yes, I did.

834
01:52:35,898 --> 01:52:41,507
You know what happens when a cuckoo
hatches inside another bird's nest?

835
01:52:42,738 --> 01:52:44,605
Yes.

836
01:52:45,073 --> 01:52:47,477
It forces the other eggs out.

837
01:52:47,577 --> 01:52:50,015
Yes. Well...

838
01:52:50,115 --> 01:52:54,268
this cuckoo made me realize
my father's life had to end.

839
01:52:55,151 --> 01:52:57,807
In a way, he's responsible
for the path I took.

840
01:52:57,907 --> 01:53:01,255
So, thank you. Cuckoo.

841
01:53:06,445 --> 01:53:09,647
Do you know any other birdcalls, Franz?

842
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:19,272
Hello, pussy.

843
01:53:21,010 --> 01:53:24,639
Franz Oberhauser died 20 years ago, James.

844
01:53:24,739 --> 01:53:28,584
In an avalanche, alongside his father.

845
01:53:28,684 --> 01:53:33,156
The man you are talking to now,
the man inside your head,

846
01:53:33,856 --> 01:53:36,373
is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

847
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:38,521
Catchy name.

848
01:53:38,921 --> 01:53:41,470
My mother's bloodline.

849
01:53:42,298 --> 01:53:47,036
If the needle finds the correct spot
in the fusiform gyrus,

850
01:53:47,136 --> 01:53:49,271
you'll recognize no one.

851
01:53:49,371 --> 01:53:53,692
Of course, the faces of your women
are interchangeable, aren't they, James?

852
01:53:54,844 --> 01:53:56,612
You won't know who she is.

853
01:53:56,712 --> 01:54:01,047
Just another passing face
on your way to the grave.

854
01:54:08,658 --> 01:54:11,442
He dies not knowing who you are.

855
01:54:13,663 --> 01:54:16,065
The daughter of an assassin.

856
01:54:16,165 --> 01:54:19,234
The only one who could have
understood him.

857
01:54:19,334 --> 01:54:20,780
Shame.

858
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,987
I love you.

859
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:07,841
Do those blue eyes still recognize you?

860
01:55:11,387 --> 01:55:14,056
I'd recognize you anywhere.

861
01:55:16,425 --> 01:55:18,558
The watch.

862
01:55:33,142 --> 01:55:35,243
One minute.

863
01:55:36,078 --> 01:55:38,482
One minute.

864
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:44,852
- Did he say something?
- Tempus fugit.

865
01:55:46,388 --> 01:55:49,658
- What?
- Tempus fugit.

866
01:55:49,758 --> 01:55:52,180
I can't hear you, James.

867
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:56,065
I said...

868
01:55:56,165 --> 01:55:58,698
doesn't time fly?

869
01:56:25,344 --> 01:56:27,448
In there!

870
01:57:08,337 --> 01:57:10,494
Let's go home.

871
01:57:25,921 --> 01:57:28,288
It's not over yet.

872
01:58:17,506 --> 01:58:21,971
- I've never even heard of Hildebrand.
- That is the general idea with safe houses.

873
01:58:39,361 --> 01:58:42,930
- Exactly how safe is this, sir?
- We're about to find out.

874
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:49,814
It's safe. Better wait here.

875
01:58:52,942 --> 01:58:55,077
- I'm M.
- Madeleine Swann.

876
01:58:55,177 --> 01:58:58,146
Pleased to meet you.
So, what do you have for me, 007?

877
01:58:58,246 --> 01:59:02,952
The recently deceased head of Spectre,
Ernst Stavro Blofeld,

878
01:59:03,052 --> 01:59:07,687
and his chief of intelligence,
your new best friend, C.

879
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:12,400
About to take control of his very own
global surveillance system that he built

880
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:13,862
right here under our noses.

881
01:59:13,962 --> 01:59:16,399
Then we'd better move.
The system goes online at midnight.

882
01:59:16,499 --> 01:59:19,665
If that happens, Spectre
will have control of everything.

883
01:59:19,765 --> 01:59:22,990
So, you and I will have a quiet word
with C while Q hacks into the system

884
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:25,974
- and stops it going online.
- It won't be easy.

885
01:59:26,074 --> 01:59:29,576
He'll find a way. He always does.

886
01:59:33,382 --> 01:59:36,018
It's good to have you back, 007.

887
01:59:36,118 --> 01:59:37,917
Sir.

888
01:59:46,729 --> 01:59:49,198
James, I can't.

889
01:59:49,398 --> 01:59:53,133
I'll come back for you when it's all over.

890
01:59:53,235 --> 01:59:54,837
No, I can't.

891
01:59:55,137 --> 01:59:57,780
No, you can't stay here, or you...

892
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:02,811
I can't go back to this life.
And I'm not going to ask you to change.

893
02:00:02,911 --> 02:00:04,452
This is who you are.

894
02:00:07,049 --> 02:00:09,318
You're saying good-bye.

895
02:00:09,418 --> 02:00:11,247
Yes.

896
02:00:12,737 --> 02:00:14,971
Take care.

897
02:00:16,658 --> 02:00:18,494
You're a good man, James.

898
02:01:19,721 --> 02:01:21,457
Are you in yet, Q?

899
02:01:21,557 --> 02:01:26,047
A few layers of impenetrable security still
to go, but I think I'm getting somewhere.

900
02:02:14,543 --> 02:02:17,160
They've seen us! Reverse!

901
02:02:55,918 --> 02:02:57,184
Go!

902
02:03:08,229 --> 02:03:10,098
Get him in the building!

903
02:03:10,198 --> 02:03:12,428
Move. Move!

904
02:04:31,313 --> 02:04:35,472
Go back and find M, now!
We need them both.

905
02:04:44,526 --> 02:04:47,349
Not a good feeling being watched, is it?

906
02:04:51,967 --> 02:04:56,605
- Don't tell me you're responsible for this.
- No, but my Quartermaster is.

907
02:04:56,705 --> 02:04:59,908
- And he's extremely talented.
- Well, bravo.

908
02:05:00,008 --> 02:05:03,680
But in case you hadn't realized it,
you two are out of a job.

909
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:05,513
So you're trespassing.

910
02:05:05,613 --> 02:05:08,116
I'm afraid you've got the wrong end
of the stick, Max.

911
02:05:08,216 --> 02:05:10,952
We're going to stop
this system going online.

912
02:05:11,052 --> 02:05:14,189
- And then I'm going to bring you in.
- On what grounds exactly?

913
02:05:14,289 --> 02:05:16,423
Poor taste in friends.

914
02:05:52,427 --> 02:05:54,979
Take a look at the world.

915
02:05:56,532 --> 02:05:58,398
Chaos.

916
02:05:58,734 --> 02:06:02,370
Because people like you,
paper-pushers and politicians,

917
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:05,974
are too spineless to do
what needs to be done.

918
02:06:06,274 --> 02:06:09,845
So I made an alliance to put
the power where it should be.

919
02:06:09,945 --> 02:06:15,143
And now you want to throw it away
for the sake of "democracy."

920
02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:17,252
Whatever the hell that is.

921
02:06:17,652 --> 02:06:20,275
How predictably moronic.

922
02:06:20,375 --> 02:06:23,957
But then isn't that what M stands for?

923
02:06:25,627 --> 02:06:27,661
"Moron."

924
02:06:28,763 --> 02:06:32,198
And now we know what C stands for.

925
02:06:35,538 --> 02:06:37,049
"Careless."

926
02:07:16,395 --> 02:07:18,063
Come on.

927
02:07:18,513 --> 02:07:20,846
No, no, no!

928
02:08:24,152 --> 02:08:27,151
You're a hard man to kill, Blofeld.

929
02:08:36,491 --> 02:08:39,428
I do hope that doesn't hurt too much.

930
02:08:39,528 --> 02:08:41,937
My wounds will heal.

931
02:08:43,198 --> 02:08:44,783
What about yours?

932
02:08:46,368 --> 02:08:48,737
Look around you, James. Look.

933
02:08:48,837 --> 02:08:51,406
This is what's left of your world.

934
02:08:51,506 --> 02:08:55,749
Everything you ever stood for,
everything you believed in, a ruin.

935
02:08:56,979 --> 02:08:59,380
Why are we here?

936
02:09:00,849 --> 02:09:02,522
Did you miss me?

937
02:09:03,352 --> 02:09:05,151
No.

938
02:09:11,292 --> 02:09:13,987
But I know someone who does.

939
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:23,715
Where is she?

940
02:09:24,439 --> 02:09:27,033
That's for you to find out.

941
02:09:34,382 --> 02:09:38,301
In three minutes,
this building will be demolished.

942
02:09:38,486 --> 02:09:42,857
I can get out easily.
Now, you have a choice.

943
02:09:42,957 --> 02:09:45,494
Die trying to save her or...

944
02:09:45,594 --> 02:09:48,931
save yourself and live with the pain.

945
02:09:49,031 --> 02:09:51,063
You're bluffing.

946
02:09:52,834 --> 02:09:54,700
Am I?

947
02:10:01,526 --> 02:10:04,692
I've really put you through it, haven't I?

948
02:10:05,213 --> 02:10:07,549
That's brothers for you.

949
02:10:07,649 --> 02:10:10,788
They always know which buttons to press.

950
02:10:23,732 --> 02:10:25,653
Madeleine!

951
02:10:30,906 --> 02:10:32,640
Come on.

952
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:34,687
Come on.

953
02:10:35,376 --> 02:10:37,309
Yes!

954
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:41,836
Let's go. After you.

955
02:10:52,093 --> 02:10:54,859
Why can't you just face it, M?

956
02:10:56,531 --> 02:10:58,700
You don't matter anymore.

957
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:02,155
Maybe I don't. But something has to.

958
02:11:57,225 --> 02:11:59,185
- Dead.
- Any word on Bond?

959
02:11:59,285 --> 02:12:01,689
No. But I can hazard a guess.

960
02:12:09,471 --> 02:12:11,493
Madeleine!

961
02:12:13,675 --> 02:12:15,704
Madeleine!

962
02:13:00,589 --> 02:13:03,157
- Do you trust me?
- Do I have a choice?

963
02:13:03,257 --> 02:13:05,290
Not anymore.

964
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:16,569
Come on!

965
02:13:31,352 --> 02:13:33,381
Good-bye, James Bond.

966
02:15:36,011 --> 02:15:37,802
Brace, brace, brace!

967
02:16:45,313 --> 02:16:49,014
- Sir, this is a terrorist alert.
- Mallory, double-0 section.

968
02:16:51,086 --> 02:16:53,253
Stand them down.

969
02:16:54,555 --> 02:16:57,925
- Echo team, hold fire.
- Stand down.

970
02:17:34,311 --> 02:17:35,445
Finish it.

971
02:17:46,941 --> 02:17:48,629
Finish it.

972
02:18:01,089 --> 02:18:03,055
Out of bullets.

973
02:18:19,440 --> 02:18:21,616
And besides...

974
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:23,943
I've got something better to do.

975
02:19:10,291 --> 02:19:12,360
Under the Special Measures Act of 2001,

976
02:19:12,460 --> 02:19:15,511
I am detaining you on behalf
of Her Majesty's Government.

977
02:20:21,662 --> 02:20:22,970
Bond?

978
02:20:28,135 --> 02:20:31,171
- What are you doing here?
- Good morning, Q.

979
02:20:37,895 --> 02:20:40,366
- I thought you'd gone.
- I have.

980
02:20:42,150 --> 02:20:44,534
There's just one thing I need.
