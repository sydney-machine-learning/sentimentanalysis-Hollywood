1
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,338
Boys, let's do this!

2
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,946
Gray?

3
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,167
Honey, what are you doing?

4
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:17,967
What is this here? Let's go.

5
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:20,313
Come on, honey.
Your flight's in two hours.

6
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:23,603
Dane County Airport is 36 minutes away,
60 with traffic.

7
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:26,601
How many minutes
to get your little butt in the van?

8
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:29,877
How many of those?

9
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:32,458
-Feed the monster under your bed?
-Yes.

10
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,962
Call me every day...

11
00:02:36,963 --> 00:02:39,812
and text me pics
so I don't forget what you look like.

12
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:41,581
I'm only gonna be gone a week.

13
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:42,724
Zach.

14
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:46,418
You're not going off to war here.
Please.

15
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:47,526
Come on.

16
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:50,586
-I will see you later.
-I love you.

17
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,538
-Bye, okay?
-Bye.

18
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,120
Are you in, buddy?

19
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:01,078
I know it hurts, sweetheart.

20
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,747
Are you gonna be okay?

21
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:09,747
Everything right on there?

22
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:11,668
I'm so jealous.

23
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,869
You're gonna have so much fun.
I love you.

24
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,162
I love you, too.

25
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:24,794
Okay, great.

26
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:28,192
All right, let's give these
to your brother, okay?

27
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:30,768
You hold these, please.
Can you hold these?

28
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,176
-Honey, I need you to take care of these.
-Yeah.

29
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:33,923
Hey.

30
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:35,893
-Alright
-Listen to your mother.

31
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,785
Take care of your brother.
Answer your phone.

32
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:42,455
I'm serious. It's the green button.
When you see my name, push it, okay?

33
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:46,565
And remember...
something chases you, run.

34
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:48,131
Come on.

35
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:50,781
-All right.
-You're funny. Okay, let's go. Come on.

36
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:51,782
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

37
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:54,256
-I miss you already.
-Yeah.

38
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:58,474
So much for our last family breakfast.

39
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:02,051
Why do you have to say things like that?

40
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,953
Did you call your sister?

41
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,433
Straight to voicemail.

42
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,230
It'll be fine.

43
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:11,299
She handles 20,000 people a day, right?

44
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,607
She can handle two more.

45
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:19,134
How big is the island?

46
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,762
Big.

47
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:22,707
But how many pounds?

48
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,717
That doesn't make sense.

49
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:30,421
When they first opened,
they had 8 species.

50
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:33,245
Now they have 14 herbivores
and 6 carnivores.

51
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,912
That's 50 tons of food a week.

52
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:58,621
<i>Welcome to Isla Nublar,
home of Jurassic World.</i>

53
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:01,319
<i>We hope you have
a safe and enjoyable stay with us.</i>

54
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,786
Where's Aunt Claire?

55
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:32,608
<i>Those of you in the front of the train
should be able to see our main gates.</i>

56
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:47,205
<i>Please obey all park rules.</i>

57
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:50,804
<i>Proper attire, including shoes and shirts,
must be worn at all times.</i>

58
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:54,556
Your aunt arranged to meet you at 1:00.
Can he slow down?

59
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:56,158
Nope.

60
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,179
Come on!

61
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,492
Your aunt's got you VIP access...

62
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:08,047
so you can get in all the rides
without waiting in line.

63
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,301
Let's go.

64
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,528
Dude, she said we had to wait.

65
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:12,087
I don't wanna wait anymore.

66
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:45,011
Hal Osterley, vice president.
Jim Drucker, bad hair.

67
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,302
Erica Brand, deserves better.

68
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:50,214
Hal, Jim, Erica.
Hal, Jim, Erica.

69
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:51,809
And I am Claire.

70
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:55,110
Three minutes late.

71
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:00,349
Welcome to Jurassic World.

72
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,232
While year over year,
revenue continues to climb...

73
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,490
operating costs are higher than ever.

74
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:10,062
Our shareholders have been patient
but let's be honest...

75
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,369
no one is impressed
by a dinosaur anymore.

76
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,467
20 years ago, de-extinction
was right up there with magic.

77
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:20,948
These days, kids look at a Stegosaurus
like an elephant from the city zoo.

78
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,746
That doesn't mean
asset development is falling behind.

79
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:27,529
Our DNA excavators
discover new species every year.

80
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,653
But consumers want them bigger,
louder, more teeth.

81
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,254
The good news?

82
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,916
Our advances in gene splicing
have opened up a whole new frontier.

83
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:41,603
We've learned more from genetics
in the past decade...

84
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:44,573
than a century of digging up bones.

85
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:45,535
So...

86
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:49,501
when you say you want to
sponsor an attraction...

87
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,350
what do you have in mind?

88
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:54,183
We want to be thrilled.

89
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:55,955
Don't we all?

90
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:03,910
The Indominus rex.
Our first genetically modified hybrid.

91
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:07,593
How did you get two different kinds
of dinosaurs to, you know...

92
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:12,408
Oh, Indominus wasn't bred.
She was designed.

93
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,677
She will be 50 feet long
when fully grown.

94
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,947
Bigger than the T. rex.

95
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:22,436
Every time we've unveiled a new asset,
attendance has spiked.

96
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:24,071
Global news coverage...

97
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,871
celebrity visitors.

98
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,699
Eyes of the world.

99
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,296
When will she be ready?

100
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:33,118
She already is.

101
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:48,099
Come on!

102
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,485
Relax.

103
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:50,993
Come on.

104
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:52,538
Dude, chill.

105
00:08:57,022 --> 00:09:01,573
<i>Welcome to the Innovation Center,
where technology meets prehistory.</i>

106
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,999
<i>...can go horn-to-tooth
with the apex predators.</i>

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,594
<i>Literally meaning "three-horned face"
in Greek...</i>

108
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:19,538
<i>Triceratops is half as tall as T. rex</i>

109
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:23,528
<i>...as one-hundred trillion tons of TNT.</i>

110
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,999
<i>...turn its head back
to look over its shoulder...</i>

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,610
<i>to better aim the swing
of its dangerous tail.</i>

112
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:36,715
Cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine.

113
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:38,370
The same four things
in everything that ever lived.

114
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,908
Hey, don't wander off, all right?
Mom's not paying me for babysitting.

115
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,438
Gray, is that you?

116
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,896
Aunt Claire!

117
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:49,356
Okay, yeah. No, I'm gonna have to go.
My nephews are here.

118
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,249
Hi.

119
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,890
Oh, my gosh, you're so sweet.

120
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:58,152
Whoa, Zach.

121
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:00,727
Last time I saw you, you were like--

122
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:02,114
That must've been what?

123
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,714
-Three, four years ago?
-Seven.

124
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,960
Seven years, but, you know, close.

125
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,978
I see you already got your wristbands.

126
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:12,656
And this is for food.

127
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:15,490
And Zara here is going
to take great care of you...

128
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,444
until I'm done working tonight, okay?

129
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:19,430
You're not coming with us?

130
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:22,542
I really wish that I could, but...

131
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:26,310
tomorrow I can take you
into the control room...

132
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,398
show you behind the scenes
and all of that.

133
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,610
That's gonna be cool, right?

134
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:37,564
Okay, so I will see you
tonight at... 6:00.

135
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:39,102
No, no, no.
Don't forget you have the...

136
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:41,216
Right, of course.
I will see you tonight at 8:00.

137
00:10:41,217 --> 00:10:45,857
What time do you go to sleep?
Or do you go to sleep at different times?

138
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:50,564
Okay, so, have fun...

139
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:53,352
and take very good care of them, okay?

140
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:56,354
Yeah. No, I'm here.

141
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:03,458
<i>It's those two juvenile Triceratops.
They're going at it again.</i>

142
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,349
<i>Should I tranq them, or are you
coming over to take care of this?</i>

143
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,276
<i>-Go ahead and tranq them.
-They're running.</i>

144
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:12,321
-What's the live count?
-22,216.

145
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:13,756
-Any incidents?
-Yes.

146
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,502
Six kids in the Lost and Found...

147
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:17,934
28 down with heatstroke...

148
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:19,573
Where did you get that?

149
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,960
Oh, this? I got it on eBay.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

150
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:27,671
I got it for $150
but the mint condition one goes for $300...

151
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:29,330
Didn't occur to you
maybe that's in poor taste?

152
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:31,193
The shirt? Yeah, no, it did.

153
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:33,117
I understand people died.
It was terrible...

154
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:36,553
but that first park was legit.

155
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:39,418
I have a lot of respect for it.
They didn't need these genetic hybrids.

156
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:41,476
They just needed dinosaurs,
real dinosaurs.

157
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:43,333
Okay, please don't wear it again.

158
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:44,493
Yeah, I wasn't gonna.

159
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,854
-Did you close the deal?
-Looks like it.

160
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:50,581
Verizon Wireless presents
the Indominus rex.

161
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:52,487
That is so terrible.

162
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:57,663
Why not just go the distance, and just let
these corporations name the dinosaurs?

163
00:11:57,664 --> 00:11:59,143
They've got all the ballparks.

164
00:11:59,144 --> 00:12:01,745
-Why stop there?
-Why are the West Plains closed?

165
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:03,508
Another Pachy roaming outside his zone.

166
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:05,359
But he's fully sedated
and ready for relocation.

167
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,738
Pepsi-saurus or Tostito-don.

168
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:11,722
Security said the invisible fences were a no-fail.
That is the second time this month.

169
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:14,827
The Pachys short out their implants
when they butt heads.

170
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:16,835
How much longer
until they get it out of there?

171
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,580
He just got five milligrams
of carfentanil.

172
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:23,865
Yes, he's very stoned.
So why don't we show a little sympathy?

173
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:27,212
I mean you do understand
these are actual animals, right?

174
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,040
Clean up your workspace.

175
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,569
It's chaotic.

176
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,072
I like to think of it
as a living system.

177
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:36,711
Just enough stability...

178
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:39,698
to keep it from collapsing into anarchy.

179
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:49,781
<i>Inbound chopper, Jurassic 1.
ETA, 5 minutes.</i>

180
00:12:50,933 --> 00:13:00,525
<b>Subtitle created by Freaky.</b>

181
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:14,947
Claire.

182
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:18,368
Mr. Masrani. You are flying.

183
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:19,971
I got my license.

184
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:22,349
-Two more.
-Well, two more days.

185
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,527
-Okay.
-So...

186
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:25,690
-how's my park doing?
-Great.

187
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:28,025
We're up two and a half percent
over last year.

188
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:29,882
A bit lower than our initial prediction.

189
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:31,650
No, no, no, how's it doing?

190
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:34,606
Are the guests having fun?
Are the animals enjoying life?

191
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:38,801
Well, guest satisfaction is steady
in the low 90s.

192
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:43,009
We don't have a way to measure
the animals' emotional experience.

193
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,459
Sure you do. You can see in their eyes.

194
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,840
Right?

195
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,130
Of course.

196
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:52,639
Okay. Now show me my new dinosaur.

197
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:01,212
Got it.

198
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,891
Got it.

199
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:04,782
Got it.

200
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,302
Oh, my!

201
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:20,870
You look tense, Claire.

202
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:24,927
Maybe you should just focus
on the controls.

203
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:30,795
The key to a happy life is to accept
you are never actually in control.

204
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:32,360
Bird!

205
00:14:35,797 --> 00:14:37,177
You should spend a day at the beach.

206
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:38,510
Get some sun.

207
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:40,591
Right, so...

208
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:44,491
Marketing thought we could
offset some of the costs by--

209
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,269
Enough about cost.

210
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,100
John Hammond entrusted me
with his dying wish...

211
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,004
and not once did he mention profits.

212
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:53,347
"Spare no expense," he used to say.

213
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:57,742
I appreciate that, but the reality
of operating a theme park requires--

214
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,590
Don't forget
why we built this place, Claire.

215
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:04,534
Jurassic World exists to remind us
how very small we are. How new.

216
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:06,165
You can't put a price on that.

217
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,894
Now, please, we're flying.

218
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:12,927
Breathe.

219
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,216
Is he okay?

220
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:43,399
- Are you okay?
- He's just being dramatic.

221
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,942
Are you still building?

222
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:49,044
We planned to open in May...

223
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:52,493
but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher.

224
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,358
It's bigger than expected.

225
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:02,062
It's a good sign.

226
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:07,078
We hit a few speed bumps early on.

227
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,343
It began to anticipate where
the food would come from.

228
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,475
One of the handlers nearly lost an arm.

229
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:16,024
The others threatened to quit
if I couldn't guarantee their safety.

230
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:18,652
She's intelligent then?

231
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:20,747
For a dinosaur.

232
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:22,722
And that?

233
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,942
It tried to break the glass.

234
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:32,424
I like her spirit.

235
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:57,643
It's white.
You never told me it was white.

236
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:04,976
Think it will scare the kids?

237
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:07,192
The kids?

238
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:11,174
This will give the parents nightmares.

239
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:14,354
Is that good?

240
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:17,967
It's fantastic.

241
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:23,310
Can she see us?

242
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:27,947
They say it can sense thermal radiation.
Like snakes.

243
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,760
I thought there were two of them.

244
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:34,546
There was a sibling
in case this one didn't survive infancy.

245
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:35,865
Where's the sibling?

246
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:38,490
She ate it.

247
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:49,259
So, the paddock is quite safe, then?

248
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:53,602
We have the best structural engineers
in the world.

249
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:56,004
Yeah, so did Hammond.

250
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:00,597
There's an American Navy man here.

251
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:03,440
Part of a research program
one of my companies is running.

252
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:05,217
Owen Grady.

253
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:07,866
I know who he is.

254
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,818
His animals often try to escape.

255
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:13,099
They are smart.
He has to be smarter.

256
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,666
He only thinks he's smarter.

257
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:18,562
I want you to bring him in.

258
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:20,454
Let him inspect the paddock.

259
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:24,355
Maybe he sees something we can't.

260
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:41,815
Hold!

261
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:49,898
Hey!

262
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:55,591
Okay!

263
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,297
Eyes on me.

264
00:18:58,298 --> 00:18:59,686
Blue?

265
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:01,212
Blue!

266
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:03,471
Watch it.

267
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:05,236
Charlie. Hey!

268
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:06,781
Don't give me that shit!

269
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,600
Delta!

270
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:09,981
Lock it up!

271
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,579
Good!

272
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,678
And we're moving!

273
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,396
Hold!

274
00:19:24,587 --> 00:19:27,930
That's good. That is damn good.

275
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:30,149
Very good!

276
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,789
See, Charlie, that's what you get!

277
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:34,726
Echo, there you go!

278
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:35,434
Delta!

279
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,326
Blue?

280
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:43,062
This one's for you.

281
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,453
Hold!

282
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:50,160
Eyes up!

283
00:19:53,616 --> 00:19:55,210
Go.

284
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:03,178
You finally did it, man.

285
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,184
Owen.

286
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:09,198
I was starting to think I hired
the wrong guys...

287
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,155
but, damn, you got them
eating out of your palm.

288
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:13,363
You came on a good day.
It's not usually a happy ending.

289
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:15,282
Is that why
you're not sending in your reports?

290
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:16,483
We've been busy.

291
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:19,006
Not too busy to cash your paychecks.

292
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,225
What do you need, buddy?

293
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,236
A field test.

294
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:28,015
Hey. I've just seen
they can respond to commands.

295
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:30,492
We need to take the research
and get it on its feet.

296
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:33,259
These are wild animals, Hoskins.
Trust me, you don't want them in the field.

297
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,506
I just saw a bond. A real bond.

298
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,403
Between man and beast.

299
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,373
-You're in my way.
-Come on. We're the same.

300
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,840
We're dogs of war.

301
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,048
We know that the military
needs to reduce casualties.

302
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:48,302
Some people think
that robots are the future.

303
00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:53,649
Look, nature gave us the most effective
killing machines 75 million years ago.

304
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,925
And now we know they can take orders.

305
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,787
We finally make progress
and that's the first thing he says?

306
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,167
Make a weapon?

307
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:01,526
Shit.

308
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:03,439
Come on, gents.

309
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,180
It's grown-up time.

310
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:09,442
Drones can't search tunnels and caves.
And they're hackable.

311
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:12,842
The minute a real war breaks out,
all that fancy tech is gonna go dark.

312
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:15,998
But that tech's not gonna eat them
if they forget to feed it.

313
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:18,884
Look at these creatures.

314
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:23,277
They've got millions of years of instinct
in their cells, instinct that we can program.

315
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:26,175
Their loyalty cannot be bought.

316
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,787
These guys are gonna run straight
into the enemy's teeth and eat them...

317
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,077
belt buckle and all.

318
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:35,142
What if they decide
they wanna be in control?

319
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:38,071
Then we remind them who is.
We terminate the rogues.

320
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:40,427
Promote only loyal bloodlines.

321
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:43,849
What? What's so funny?

322
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:51,774
except what you want to know.

323
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:55,165
You made them
and now you think you own them.

324
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,282
We do own them.

325
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,323
Extinct animals have no rights.

326
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,481
They're not extinct anymore, Hoskins.

327
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:05,593
Exactly. We're sitting on a goldmine.

328
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:09,626
And Masrani is using it
to stock a petting zoo.

329
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:12,329
He just wants to teach people some humility.
He doesn't make weapons.

330
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,115
You think that the 8th richest man
in the world...

331
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:19,169
is only into oil, telecom
and family fun parks?

332
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,635
He's so diversified,
he doesn't even know what he owns.

333
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:23,872
How long has iNGen
been practicing this pitch?

334
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:28,038
Since the day we hired you out of the Navy.
You knew the end game.

335
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,883
These animals can replace
thousands of boots on the ground.

336
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,467
How many lives would that save?

337
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:37,846
War is part of nature.

338
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:42,575
Look around, Owen.
Every living thing in this jungle...

339
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:45,195
is trying to murder the other.

340
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:48,397
Mother Nature's way of testing
her creations.

341
00:22:48,398 --> 00:22:50,237
Refining the pecking order.

342
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:54,127
War is a struggle.
Struggle breeds greatness.

343
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:56,253
Without that...

344
00:22:56,254 --> 00:22:59,122
we end up with places like this,
charge seven bucks a soda.

345
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:02,619
Do you hear yourself when you talk?

346
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:09,820
This is gonna happen.
With or without you boys.

347
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,664
Progress always wins, man.

348
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:14,374
Maybe progress should lose for once.

349
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:17,559
Pig loose!

350
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,497
Pig loose!

351
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:39,036
Owen, no!

352
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,090
No, hold your fire!

353
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,238
Hold your fire. Do not fire.

354
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,679
Put 12 amps in these animals,
they're never gonna trust me again.

355
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:58,210
Blue, stand down.

356
00:23:59,492 --> 00:24:01,372
Stand down.

357
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:04,564
Hey! Hey! What did I just say?

358
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,553
Delta, I see you. Back up!

359
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:11,476
Okay.

360
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:13,140
Good.

361
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:14,933
Good.

362
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:16,688
Charlie?

363
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:19,674
Stay right there.

364
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:21,503
Good.

365
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:25,527
Close the gate.

366
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:27,296
Are you crazy?

367
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:28,894
Just trust me.

368
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:30,297
Close the gate!

369
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,178
Yeah.

370
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:56,006
You're the new guy, right?

371
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:57,476
Yeah.

372
00:24:57,477 --> 00:25:00,196
You ever wonder why there was
a job opening?

373
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:05,042
Don't ever turn your back to the cage.

374
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,331
Lift me up. I can't see!

375
00:25:51,331 --> 00:25:54,026
I'm not Dad. And you're not five.

376
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:57,944
I can still ride the Triceratops.
I'm 47-and-a-half inches.

377
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:00,476
This place is for little kids.

378
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:02,869
Yeah, I know.

379
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,864
-Wanna go on the spinning dinosaur eggs?
-Nope.

380
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,892
Cover up your dork pouch.

381
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:09,945
It's my wedding.

382
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:12,296
No, Alec's not having a bachelor party.

383
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:14,255
Because all his friends are animals.

384
00:26:14,444 --> 00:26:15,441
Scatter.

385
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:18,499
-What?
-Go. Run. Go! Go, go!

386
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:41,019
<i>The next T. rex feeding
will begin in 10 minutes.</i>

387
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:43,321
-T. rex! Come on, man!
-Okay.

388
00:26:43,322 --> 00:26:44,215
Let's go!

389
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:48,771
<i>Parents be aware, this show may be
disturbing for smaller children.</i>

390
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:01,036
Hey, Mom.

391
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,855
<i>You were supposed to call me
when you landed.</i>

392
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:06,228
Are you having fun?

393
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:08,139
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

394
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:12,394
Aunt Claire gave us passes
so we don't have to wait in line.

395
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:14,007
Wait, she's not with you?

396
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,281
Hey, Karen!

397
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:23,059
<i>Hi, Claire. How's it going?</i>

398
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,973
Yeah, everything's great.
The boys are having fun.

399
00:27:25,974 --> 00:27:28,545
<i>Everyone's... Yeah, everyone's good.</i>

400
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:32,363
Really? Because I just hung up with Zach
and he said that you weren't even with them.

401
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:38,167
Yeah, look. Today turned out to be
a really bad day for me.

402
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:41,546
<i>They're in great hands.
They're with my assistant.</i>

403
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:45,288
<i>She's British, so, like,
they invented nannies.</i>

404
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,388
Wait, are you crying?

405
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:53,524
This was supposed to be
a family weekend, Claire.

406
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:55,449
You haven't seen the boys in forever.

407
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,741
And I know how Zach will treat Gray
if they're by themselves.

408
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,339
<i>And he can just be so mean.</i>

409
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,193
Okay, I'm sorry.

410
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:05,624
<i>Tomorrow, I'm gonna spend
the entire day with them.</i>

411
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,838
<i>I'm going to take off work
and I will not leave their side. I promise.</i>

412
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:12,509
<i>Well, a promise tomorrow is worth
a lot less than trying today.</i>

413
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:15,299
You're using Mom's lines now?

414
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,463
Oh, my God.
I am using Mom's lines.

415
00:28:18,442 --> 00:28:20,425
I'm sorry, but you know
I have to tell you they work.

416
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:22,037
<i>You'll see when you have kids.</i>

417
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:23,321
Yeah, "if."

418
00:28:23,322 --> 00:28:27,000
"When." It's worth it.

419
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:28,739
Bye, Mom.

420
00:28:30,748 --> 00:28:32,759
Bye.

421
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,279
What do they want now?

422
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:52,731
Mr. Grady?

423
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:57,576
I need you to come
take a look at something.

424
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:01,116
Why are you calling me Mr. Grady?

425
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:02,521
Owen.

426
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:06,753
-If you're not too busy.
-I'm pretty busy.

427
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:08,486
We have an attraction.

428
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:10,327
That's not what you said
the last time I saw you.

429
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:12,972
I'm talking about the dinosaurs,
Mr. Grady.

430
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:13,863
Owen.

431
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:16,760
A new species we've... made.

432
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,204
You just went and made a new dinosaur?

433
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:24,925
Yeah, it's kind of what we do here.

434
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:28,107
The exhibit opens to the public
in three weeks.

435
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:31,260
Mr. Masrani wanted me
to consult with you.

436
00:29:31,261 --> 00:29:36,333
You wanna consult here or...
in my bungalow?

437
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:38,248
That's not funny.

438
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:40,690
A little funny.

439
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:43,715
We'd like you to evaluate the paddock
for vulnerabilities.

440
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:44,804
Why me?

441
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:52,022
I guess Mr. Masrani thinks,
since you're able to control the Raptors...

442
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,597
It's all about control with you.

443
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:56,340
I don't control the Raptors.
It's a relationship.

444
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:59,003
It's based on mutual respect.

445
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,210
That's why you and I never had
a second date.

446
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:06,065
Excuse me?
I never wanted a second date.

447
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:07,786
Who prints out an itinerary
for a night out?

448
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:09,442
I'm an organized person.

449
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:11,638
What kind of a diet
doesn't allow tequila?

450
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:13,260
All of them, actually.

451
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:17,594
And what kind of a man
shows up to a date in board shorts?

452
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:19,324
It's Central America. It's hot.

453
00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:22,996
Okay, okay.
Can we just focus on the asset, please?

454
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:24,264
The asset?

455
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:28,361
Look, I get it.
You're in charge out here.

456
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:29,822
You gotta make a lot of tough decisions.

457
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:33,522
It's probably easier to pretend these animals
are just numbers on a spreadsheet.

458
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:36,714
But they're not. They're alive.

459
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:39,315
I'm fully aware they're alive.

460
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:42,219
You might have made them in a test tube,
but they don't know that.

461
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,168
They're thinking, "I gotta eat."

462
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:48,336
"I gotta hunt. I gotta..."

463
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:54,587
You can relate to at least
one of those things. Right?

464
00:30:57,953 --> 00:30:59,514
I'll be in the car.

465
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:09,497
You might want to change your shirt.
They're very sensitive to smell.

466
00:31:18,983 --> 00:31:22,620
The Mosasaurus was thought to have
hunted near the surface of the water...

467
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:26,079
where it preyed on anything
it could sink its teeth into.

468
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,520
Including turtles, large fish,
even smaller Mosasaurus.

469
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:36,636
Okay, folks, let's see if she's still
hungry after already eating today.

470
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:42,010
She's a little shy, so be nice
and give her a hand when she comes out.

471
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:43,011
Zach!

472
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:44,331
The Mosasaurus!

473
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,922
Oh, my God! That was awesome!

474
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:07,256
Hold on tight. We're gonna give you
an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.

475
00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:22,994
It had 88 teeth!

476
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:27,446
-Wanna see something else cool?
-Yeah!

477
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:37,670
We've been pre-booking tickets
for months.

478
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:40,779
The park needs a new attraction
every few years...

479
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,983
in order to reinvigorate
the public's interest.

480
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:44,634
Kind of like the space program.

481
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:48,617
Corporate felt genetic modification
would up the wow factor.

482
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:50,661
They're dinosaurs. Wow enough.

483
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:55,954
Not according to our focus groups.
The Indominus rex makes us relevant again.

484
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:57,747
The Indominus rex?

485
00:32:57,748 --> 00:33:00,742
We needed something scary
and easy to pronounce.

486
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:04,869
You should hear a four-year-old try to say
"Archaeornithomimus."

487
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,610
You should hear you try to say it.

488
00:33:11,953 --> 00:33:13,610
So what's this thing made of?

489
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:19,453
The base genome is a T. rex.
The rest is classified.

490
00:33:19,454 --> 00:33:22,132
You made a new dinosaur
but you don't even know what it is?

491
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,822
The lab delivers us finished assets,
and we show them to the public.

492
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:27,743
Can we drop a steer, please?

493
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:29,772
How long has the animal been in here?

494
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:32,004
All its life.

495
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:34,372
Never seen anything outside
of these walls?

496
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:35,738
We can't exactly walk it.

497
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,227
And you feed it with that?

498
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,195
Is there a problem?

499
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:47,604
Animals raised in isolation aren't
always the most functional.

500
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:50,942
Your Raptors are born in captivity.

501
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:54,713
With siblings. They learn social skills.

502
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:56,844
And I imprint on them when they're born.

503
00:33:56,845 --> 00:33:58,117
There's trust.

504
00:33:58,118 --> 00:34:01,936
The only positive relationship
this animal has is with that crane.

505
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:04,993
At least she knows that means food.

506
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:07,756
So, she needs a friend.

507
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:10,377
We should schedule play-dates?
That sort of thing?

508
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:13,362
Probably not a good idea.

509
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:19,979
-Where is it?
-Is it in the basement?

510
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,546
Is there a downstairs?
Maybe it's in the rec room.

511
00:34:23,547 --> 00:34:25,510
It was just here. We were just here.

512
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:36,509
Oh, shit.

513
00:34:38,753 --> 00:34:40,260
That doesn't make any sense.

514
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,847
These doors haven't been opened
in weeks.

515
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:48,573
Were those claw marks always there?

516
00:34:54,207 --> 00:34:55,928
Do you think it...?

517
00:34:58,073 --> 00:35:00,253
Oh, God.

518
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:02,419
She has an implant in her back.

519
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,907
I can track it from the control room.

520
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:16,874
We have an asset out of containment.

521
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,778
Put ACU on alert. This is not a drill.

522
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:22,705
Even though I didn't meet him
until I was 13...

523
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:25,934
I definitely consider Carl to be
more of a dad than my real dad.

524
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:32,575
-Yeah, hello?
-Lowery.

525
00:35:32,576 --> 00:35:34,856
Get me coordinates on the Indominus.

526
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,778
Okay, yeah.

527
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:39,653
I'm doing it right now.

528
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,324
That wall is 40 feet high.

529
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:07,665
Do you really think
she could have climbed out?

530
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:09,886
It depends.

531
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:11,670
On what?

532
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:15,675
What kind of dinosaur
they cooked up in that lab.

533
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:18,435
Wait, what the hell?

534
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:21,046
It's in the cage.

535
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:23,394
No, that's impossible.
I was just there.

536
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:26,112
Claire, I'm telling you, she's in the cage.

537
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,100
Wait a sec.

538
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:29,837
There are people in there.

539
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:33,880
Get them out of there now.

540
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:35,459
Now!

541
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,384
Paddock 11, this is Control.
You need to evacuate the containment area.

542
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:40,797
<i>Paddock 11.</i>

543
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,108
<i>Paddock 11, do you copy?</i>

544
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,030
Yeah, what's the problem?

545
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:46,657
It's in the cage!
It's in there with you!

546
00:36:46,658 --> 00:36:47,992
Go!

547
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:18,263
Close the door.

548
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:20,434
-We can't lock him in there with that thing.
-Close it now!

549
00:37:20,435 --> 00:37:23,290
Somebody talk to me!
What is happening?

550
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:25,808
Shit!

551
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:39,809
Everyone remain calm.

552
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:51,533
The implant will shock it
if it gets too close to a perimeter fence.

553
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:53,079
Okay.
It's moving really fast.

554
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,680
- This is Control. Put out a park-wide alert.
- Hang up that damn phone, please.

555
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:59,673
Sorry, I'm getting new information.
Everything's fine.

556
00:39:59,674 --> 00:40:01,448
Let Asset Containment
capture it quietly.

557
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:05,316
The very existence of this park
is predicated on our ability...

558
00:40:05,317 --> 00:40:07,245
to handle incidents like this.

559
00:40:07,246 --> 00:40:09,228
It was an eventuality, okay?

560
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:10,900
You should put that in the brochure.

561
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:14,671
"Eventually, one of these things
will eat somebody."

562
00:40:14,672 --> 00:40:17,964
That paddock is 4 miles
from the closest attraction.

563
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:20,623
ACU can handle this.
No one else is gonna get...

564
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:21,790
Eaten?

565
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:39,692
How fast can they run?

566
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:41,937
40.

567
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:43,653
50 when they're hungry.

568
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,686
You ever open them up,
see what they can do?

569
00:40:48,427 --> 00:40:49,535
No.

570
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:51,450
Oh, shit!

571
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:54,055
That got me. It got me.

572
00:40:54,355 --> 00:40:57,085
What do you think?
Want to take one home?

573
00:40:57,086 --> 00:40:58,160
Hey, don't joke.

574
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:00,215
When I was your age...

575
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:02,925
I rescued a wolf pup.

576
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:06,949
It was, like, two months old.
It could barely walk.

577
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,637
It used to sleep by my bed.

578
00:41:09,638 --> 00:41:10,736
Watch over me.

579
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:17,867
My wife, she came at me with a steak knife.
It took a chunk out of her arm.

580
00:41:18,455 --> 00:41:19,541
Did you put him down?

581
00:41:20,517 --> 00:41:21,613
Hell, no.

582
00:41:22,686 --> 00:41:26,095
We had an unshakeable bond, you know?

583
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:27,759
Just like you and...

584
00:41:29,393 --> 00:41:30,599
What's his name?

585
00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:34,121
Delta. And she's a girl.

586
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:36,419
Can I...?

587
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,143
Oh, wow.

588
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:58,024
Code 19!

589
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:00,724
-That's the new one!
-They said we lost two guys!

590
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:02,227
-What's a Code 19?
-That's Indominus!

591
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,228
Asset out of containment.

592
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:07,358
These people, they never learn.

593
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:12,410
They're gonna learn all kinds of things
about their new asset now.

594
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:19,824
Yeah, it's me.
We might have an opportunity here.

595
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,002
You guys been here before?

596
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:46,138
If Mom and Dad get divorced, will one of us
be with Mom and the other with Dad?

597
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:48,682
What? Why would you say that?

598
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:49,683
Because they are.

599
00:42:49,684 --> 00:42:52,747
No, they're not getting--
They're not getting divorced.

600
00:42:53,856 --> 00:42:56,641
Look, you haven't been around long enough.
They've always been that way.

601
00:42:57,148 --> 00:42:59,139
They get mail
from two different lawyers.

602
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,575
That doesn't mean anything.

603
00:43:00,576 --> 00:43:03,310
I googled. They're divorce lawyers.

604
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,446
All right, whatever.

605
00:43:07,447 --> 00:43:12,505
You know what? It doesn't matter. Okay?
I'm gonna be gone in two years anyway.

606
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,815
All my friends' parents are divorced.

607
00:43:16,884 --> 00:43:18,499
Hey, knock it off.

608
00:43:19,594 --> 00:43:20,981
You're gonna cry?

609
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:24,445
Look, you're gonna get two of everything.

610
00:43:24,446 --> 00:43:27,266
Right? Two birthdays,
two Thanksgivings. Two...

611
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:29,954
I don't want two of everything.

612
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:32,005
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.

613
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:35,399
There's a point you have to grow up.

614
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,363
I need to see a badge.

615
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:09,622
-Sir, sir. I need to see a badge.
-What the hell happened out there?

616
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:10,131
Sir!

617
00:44:10,132 --> 00:44:12,208
There are thermal cameras
all over that paddock.

618
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:13,804
She did not just disappear!

619
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:18,077
It must have been some kind
of a technical malfunction.

620
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:19,368
Were you not watching?

621
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:23,092
She marked up that wall as a distraction.
She wanted us to think she escaped!

622
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,446
Hold on.
We are talking about an animal here.

623
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:28,946
-A highly intelligent animal.
-400 meters to the beacon.

624
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:54,716
You're going after her with non-lethals.

625
00:44:54,717 --> 00:44:58,851
We have $26 million invested in that asset.
We can't just kill it.

626
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:00,256
Those men are gonna die.

627
00:45:00,257 --> 00:45:01,650
300 meters to the beacon.

628
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:04,028
-Call this mission off right now.
-They're right on top of it.

629
00:45:04,029 --> 00:45:07,396
-Call it off right now.
-You are not in control here!

630
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,037
Blood's not clotted yet.

631
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,250
<i>It's close.</i>

632
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,886
What is that?

633
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:48,959
That's her tracking implant.
She clawed it out.

634
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,864
How would it know to do that?

635
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:54,595
She remembered where they put it in.

636
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:29,717
It can camouflage!

637
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,417
Evacuate the island.

638
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:30,435
We'd never reopen.

639
00:47:30,436 --> 00:47:35,079
You made a genetic hybrid,
raised it in captivity.

640
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,738
She is seeing all of this
for the first time.

641
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:40,448
She does not even know what she is.

642
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:43,262
She will kill everything that moves.

643
00:47:43,263 --> 00:47:46,526
Do you think the animal
is contemplating its own existence?

644
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:48,508
She is learning where she fits
in the food chain...

645
00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:50,519
and I'm not sure you want
her to figure that out.

646
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,470
Now, Asset Containment can use live
ammunition in an emergency situation.

647
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:58,674
You have an M134 in your armory.
Put it on a chopper and smoke this thing!

648
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,762
We have families here. I'm not gonna turn
this place into some kind of a war zone.

649
00:48:01,763 --> 00:48:03,000
You already have.

650
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:06,606
Mr. Grady, if you're not gonna help,
there's no reason for you to be in here.

651
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:16,477
I would have a word
with your people in the lab.

652
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:21,127
That thing out there...
that's no dinosaur.

653
00:48:39,093 --> 00:48:43,115
I'm going to close everything
north of the resort.

654
00:48:43,116 --> 00:48:46,865
This is a Phase One, real world.
Bring everyone in.

655
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:49,904
This is a Phase One, real world.
I repeat, this is a Phase One.

656
00:48:49,905 --> 00:48:51,632
Bring everyone back in.

657
00:48:55,441 --> 00:48:58,015
The soft tissue is preserved
because the iron in the dinosaur's blood...

658
00:48:58,016 --> 00:49:01,408
generates free radicals,
and those are highly reactive.

659
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:04,358
The proteins and the cell membranes
get all mixed up...

660
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,567
and act as a natural preservative.

661
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,122
DNA can survive for millennia that way.

662
00:49:09,123 --> 00:49:11,935
Even if the amber mines dry up,
they'll still have bones--

663
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:12,614
Shut up.

664
00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:18,919
What do you think's gonna happen
from you just staring at them?

665
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:23,770
-Thanks, man.
-You're welcome.

666
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:27,601
Enjoy the ride.

667
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:33,971
<i>Pregnant women and those who
suffer from motion sickness...</i>

668
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:36,416
<i>should consult with a doctor
before riding this ride.</i>

669
00:49:48,693 --> 00:49:50,078
Enjoy the ride.

670
00:49:52,433 --> 00:49:53,957
Hello?

671
00:49:56,687 --> 00:49:58,687
Seriously?

672
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:02,905
Sorry, folks. The ride is closed.

673
00:50:03,963 --> 00:50:07,660
Everyone needs to proceed to the monorail
and exit towards the--

674
00:50:10,884 --> 00:50:13,201
Come on, guys, I just work here.

675
00:50:13,202 --> 00:50:17,827
Due to technical difficulties,
all our exhibits are now closed.

676
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:29,054
You know that I'm not at liberty
to reveal the asset's genetic makeup.

677
00:50:29,604 --> 00:50:32,146
Modified animals are known
to be unpredictable.

678
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:34,927
It's killed people, Henry.

679
00:50:36,016 --> 00:50:37,720
That's unfortunate.

680
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:41,874
What purpose could we have
for a dinosaur that can camouflage?

681
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:46,677
Cuttlefish genes were added to help her
withstand an accelerated growth rate.

682
00:50:46,678 --> 00:50:51,084
Cuttlefish have chromatophores
that allow the skin to change color.

683
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:54,058
It hid from thermal technology.

684
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,082
Really?

685
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,674
How is that possible?

686
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,622
Tree frogs can modulate
their infrared output.

687
00:51:04,623 --> 00:51:08,759
We used strands from their DNA
to adapt her to a tropical climate.

688
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,750
But I never imagined--

689
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:12,534
Who authorized you to do this?

690
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:14,719
You did.

691
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,233
"Bigger."

692
00:51:16,234 --> 00:51:17,888
"Scarier."

693
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:23,418
"Cooler" I believe is the word
that you used in your memo.

694
00:51:23,419 --> 00:51:27,121
You cannot have an animal
with exaggerated predator features...

695
00:51:27,122 --> 00:51:29,899
without the corresponding
behavioral traits.

696
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,344
What you're doing here...

697
00:51:31,345 --> 00:51:34,296
What you have done...

698
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:39,179
The Board will shut down this park,
seize your work, everything you've built.

699
00:51:40,819 --> 00:51:42,683
And Hammond won't be there
to protect you this time.

700
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:46,715
All of this exists because of me.

701
00:51:47,238 --> 00:51:50,639
If I don't innovate, somebody else will.

702
00:51:51,297 --> 00:51:55,049
You are to cease
all activities here immediately.

703
00:51:56,084 --> 00:51:59,830
You are acting like we are engaged
in some kind of mad science.

704
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:03,680
But we are doing
what we have done from the beginning.

705
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:07,047
Nothing in Jurassic World is natural.

706
00:52:07,048 --> 00:52:11,016
We have always filled gaps in the genome
with the DNA of other animals.

707
00:52:11,017 --> 00:52:15,270
And, if their genetic code was pure,
many of them would look quite different.

708
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:17,860
But you didn't ask for reality.
You asked for more teeth.

709
00:52:17,861 --> 00:52:20,731
-I never asked for a monster!
-"Monster" is a relative term.

710
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:23,462
To a canary, a cat is a monster.

711
00:52:23,463 --> 00:52:27,066
We're just used to being the cat.

712
00:52:31,259 --> 00:52:33,060
<i>Hey, there. I'm Jimmy Fallon.</i>

713
00:52:33,061 --> 00:52:37,115
<i>Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere,
an amazing machine made possible by science.</i>

714
00:52:37,116 --> 00:52:38,782
<i>Your safety is our main concern.</i>

715
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,028
<i>Which is why you're behind
our invisible barrier system...</i>

716
00:52:41,029 --> 00:52:44,053
<i>which protects you from things
like Dilophosaurus venom.</i>

717
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:48,676
<i>One drop of this can paralyze you,
so watch out.</i>

718
00:52:48,677 --> 00:52:51,675
<i>Is this real? It is?</i>

719
00:52:51,676 --> 00:52:56,620
<i>And for added protection, each vehicle
is surrounded by aluminum oxynitride glass.</i>

720
00:52:56,621 --> 00:52:59,680
<i>So tough,
it can stop a .50-caliber bullet.</i>

721
00:53:02,836 --> 00:53:06,005
<i>The Gyroscopic technology will keep you
upright at all times...</i>

722
00:53:06,006 --> 00:53:07,192
Where are they?

723
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:08,622
<i>...so you've got nothing to worry about.</i>

724
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:09,707
Oh, man.

725
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:49,576
<i>Due to technical difficulties
all our exhibits are now closed.</i>

726
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:52,985
<i>Please disembark all rides
and return to the resort.</i>

727
00:53:55,757 --> 00:53:58,088
Come on, we can stay out
a couple more minutes.

728
00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:01,110
But they said it was closed.

729
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:03,403
Aunt Claire gave us
special wristbands, right?

730
00:54:03,404 --> 00:54:04,787
We're VIP, dude.

731
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,655
Come on. It'll be fun.

732
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:39,936
-Hello?
-Zara.

733
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:43,266
I need you to bring the boys
back to the hotel right away.

734
00:54:43,267 --> 00:54:45,361
<i>I don't know--
I've been looking everywhere for them.</i>

735
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:47,541
Slow down. I can't hear you.

736
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:48,881
<i>Zach and Gray, they've run off.</i>

737
00:54:48,882 --> 00:54:49,882
They what?

738
00:54:54,773 --> 00:54:56,305
Hey, Claire.

739
00:54:57,182 --> 00:54:59,769
Zach, thank God.
Is Gray with you?

740
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,420
I can't really hear you.
We're in the hamster ball.

741
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:05,329
Okay. Zach, listen to me.

742
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,616
<i>I need you to--</i>

743
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,402
Hello?

744
00:55:09,403 --> 00:55:11,392
-Hello?
-Zach?

745
00:55:15,472 --> 00:55:17,407
Are there any Gyrospheres
left in the Valley?

746
00:55:17,408 --> 00:55:19,147
No, they're all accounted for.
It's my job.

747
00:55:19,148 --> 00:55:19,746
What?

748
00:55:19,747 --> 00:55:21,447
There's one in the field.

749
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:24,366
Send a team of rangers, bring them in.

750
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,342
Security, we need a search and rescue
in the Valley.

751
00:55:26,343 --> 00:55:28,748
<i>It's gonna be a while.
We've got our hands full out here.</i>

752
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,600
No, no, no. There are two guests missing!

753
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:33,518
You need to make this your top priority!

754
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:34,917
-Just do it, man.
-There's a lot of guests missing.

755
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:35,918
<i>We're doing the best we can.</i>

756
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:37,832
Okay. Fine. I'll do it myself.

757
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:41,468
<i>Hey, do you think I'm the one you need
to be worried about right now?</i>

758
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:42,469
<i>Back off!</i>

759
00:55:50,511 --> 00:55:52,434
What happened here?

760
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,852
Dude.

761
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,636
Off-road.

762
00:55:58,637 --> 00:56:00,856
But they told us to go back.

763
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:05,543
I'm just worried you're not getting
the full Jurassic World experience.

764
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:21,983
Claire!

765
00:56:23,437 --> 00:56:25,450
-I need you.
-Okay.

766
00:56:25,451 --> 00:56:26,446
I need your help.

767
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:29,569
My nephews, they're out in the Valley.
Please, if anything happens to them--

768
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:32,506
How old?

769
00:56:32,507 --> 00:56:37,781
The older one, he's high school age.
The younger one, he's...

770
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:42,247
-He's a few years...
-You don't know how old your nephews are?

771
00:56:43,356 --> 00:56:45,402
No, no. Bad idea, bad idea.

772
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:48,518
-Great idea.
-No! We're gonna get arrested.

773
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:51,628
They'll shave our heads, and we're
gonna have to make root beer in the toilet.

774
00:56:51,629 --> 00:56:52,795
What are you talking about?

775
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:55,425
There.

776
00:56:55,426 --> 00:56:58,639
You see? I told you.

777
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,906
You're welcome.
Up close and personal...

778
00:57:01,907 --> 00:57:05,618
with four dinosauruses.

779
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:07,317
Ankylosaurus.

780
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:10,970
We shouldn't be here.
And there's five dinosaurs.

781
00:57:11,414 --> 00:57:14,461
Aren't you supposed to be
a genius or something? Look.

782
00:57:14,462 --> 00:57:16,946
One, two, three...

783
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:17,995
four.

784
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:19,660
Five.

785
00:57:31,454 --> 00:57:33,670
-Go, go, go!
-Shit!

786
00:57:42,009 --> 00:57:43,321
Hold it together, man!

787
00:57:51,364 --> 00:57:53,696
Drive! Drive! Go!

788
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:26,665
We're safe in here, right?

789
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:28,259
Yeah. They're totally safe.

790
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,417
Come on.

791
00:58:34,657 --> 00:58:37,522
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

792
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:45,128
Zach.

793
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:46,133
I almost got it.

794
00:58:46,134 --> 00:58:47,506
-Zach?
-Yeah?

795
00:58:47,507 --> 00:58:48,507
Look.

796
00:58:48,508 --> 00:58:49,508
What?

797
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:46,375
Go! Go!

798
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:09,846
-We're gonna have to jump.
-I can't.

799
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:13,550
Are you ready? One, two--
Come on!

800
01:01:03,144 --> 01:01:04,772
You jumped.

801
01:01:24,772 --> 01:01:26,181
Stay in the car.

802
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,345
Hi.

803
01:01:58,346 --> 01:02:01,004
Hi.

804
01:02:13,511 --> 01:02:15,648
I know, I know.

805
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:27,696
It's all right.

806
01:02:27,697 --> 01:02:30,322
All right, girl.

807
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,106
Okay.

808
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:49,343
Okay, okay, okay.

809
01:02:49,344 --> 01:02:51,771
You're okay. Okay.

810
01:03:44,709 --> 01:03:46,130
It didn't eat them.

811
01:03:47,312 --> 01:03:49,947
It's killing for sport.

812
01:03:56,925 --> 01:03:58,869
Units on standby, ready for go.

813
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:02,795
Good. Hold off on that live feed.
We've got an evolving situation here.

814
01:04:02,796 --> 01:04:04,033
Did they give you the green light yet?

815
01:04:04,965 --> 01:04:06,177
They will.

816
01:04:12,492 --> 01:04:15,288
Owen, we have a situation here.

817
01:04:22,243 --> 01:04:23,859
<i>Hey, there. I'm Jimmy Fallon.</i>

818
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,661
<i>Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere,
an amazing machine made possible by science.</i>

819
01:04:28,819 --> 01:04:33,208
<i>Hey, there. Your safety is our main concern.
Now just relax and enjoy the ride.</i>

820
01:04:53,884 --> 01:04:56,551
No, no, no. No.

821
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:00,376
Hey.

822
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:02,703
They made it out.

823
01:05:15,687 --> 01:05:17,359
Oh, my God, they jumped.

824
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,919
Brave kids.

825
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,991
Zach! Gray!

826
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:24,669
Hey, I am not one of your damn animals.

827
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,362
Listen, those kids are still alive...

828
01:05:27,363 --> 01:05:32,008
but you and I will not be
if you continue to scream like that.

829
01:05:32,439 --> 01:05:38,508
So, you can pick up their scent, can't you?
Track their footprints?

830
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:40,258
I was with the Navy, not the Navajo.

831
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:42,347
So then what should we do?
What do you suggest we do?

832
01:05:42,348 --> 01:05:44,124
You get back. I'll find them.

833
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,725
No, we'll find them.

834
01:05:45,726 --> 01:05:50,435
You'll last two minutes in there.
Less, in those ridiculous shoes.

835
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:05,940
What is that supposed to mean?

836
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:09,429
It means I'm ready to go.

837
01:06:10,169 --> 01:06:11,570
Okay.

838
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:14,613
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm in charge out here.

839
01:06:14,614 --> 01:06:16,503
You do everything I say,
exactly as I say it.

840
01:06:16,504 --> 01:06:18,165
-Excuse me?
-Just relax.

841
01:06:20,425 --> 01:06:23,025
It's just like taking
a stroll through the woods.

842
01:06:24,396 --> 01:06:26,389
65 million years ago.

843
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:33,431
<b>Subtitle created by Freaky.</b>

844
01:07:02,124 --> 01:07:02,974
Stay here.

845
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:54,931
Wow.

846
01:08:30,685 --> 01:08:32,272
You still have those matches?

847
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:35,599
Here you go.

848
01:09:00,093 --> 01:09:01,508
Gray!

849
01:09:31,685 --> 01:09:35,601
1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, Sand Beige.

850
01:09:38,172 --> 01:09:41,379
You remember when we fixed up
Grandpa's old Malibu, right?

851
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:43,428
Yeah.

852
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:54,802
Every time this thing kills,
it moves further south.

853
01:09:54,803 --> 01:09:55,758
It's headed right for the park.

854
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:57,326
Why would she come here?

855
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:59,200
She can sense thermal radiation.

856
01:09:59,201 --> 01:10:02,420
Our emergency measures just put
all the warm bodies in one place.

857
01:10:04,487 --> 01:10:06,067
-Sir--
-iNGen.

858
01:10:07,772 --> 01:10:08,688
Hoskins.

859
01:10:09,677 --> 01:10:11,113
I know who you are.

860
01:10:11,114 --> 01:10:13,156
Then you know why I'm here.

861
01:10:15,133 --> 01:10:17,785
I've been working for two years
on an application for those Raptors.

862
01:10:19,103 --> 01:10:22,063
They can hunt and kill that creature.

863
01:10:22,064 --> 01:10:24,506
But your program
was to test their intelligence.

864
01:10:24,507 --> 01:10:26,074
Yeah, it was. And we did.

865
01:10:26,075 --> 01:10:29,758
And in the process,
we learned something.

866
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:31,535
They follow orders.

867
01:10:32,188 --> 01:10:36,504
You see, the solution to your crisis
is standing right in front of you.

868
01:10:37,214 --> 01:10:39,589
Let me be as clear as I can.

869
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:44,590
No Velociraptors are going to be
set loose on this island.

870
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:45,743
Oh, shit.

871
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:47,458
You're out of your mind!

872
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:48,871
What are you going to do
with all these people?

873
01:10:48,872 --> 01:10:50,770
You got 20,000 people here.
What are you going to do?

874
01:10:50,771 --> 01:10:52,515
They have no place to go.

875
01:10:53,248 --> 01:10:55,091
That thing is a killing machine!

876
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,266
And it will not stop.

877
01:11:01,513 --> 01:11:02,479
Okay.

878
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,764
I intend to personally
look into your project...

879
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:09,581
to determine its viability
within the moral principles of this company.

880
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:13,923
Okay, boss.

881
01:11:15,297 --> 01:11:17,420
What's your next move?

882
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,538
Sir, I can't get a hold
of your instructor.

883
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:32,026
Never mind.
He's likely caught up in the evacuation.

884
01:11:32,027 --> 01:11:34,532
You're sure there's nobody else
who can fly a helicopter?

885
01:11:35,753 --> 01:11:38,151
We don't need anyone else.

886
01:12:00,299 --> 01:12:01,662
You think it's out there?

887
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:12,380
I mean, I know for a fact
it is definitely not out there, all right?

888
01:12:12,381 --> 01:12:14,268
We're totally safe.

889
01:12:14,269 --> 01:12:17,159
Here, go take this.

890
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:20,030
You're stronger than me.

891
01:12:31,734 --> 01:12:33,766
All right. Turn it over.

892
01:12:37,278 --> 01:12:38,549
It works!

893
01:12:44,784 --> 01:12:46,528
I thought you failed your driver's test.

894
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,981
No, only the driving part.

895
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:08,406
This one of theirs?

896
01:13:08,407 --> 01:13:09,407
Yeah.

897
01:13:10,485 --> 01:13:13,178
That road goes
straight back to the park.

898
01:13:15,668 --> 01:13:18,268
How did they even get
one of these things started?

899
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:04,049
Lowery, we found her.

900
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:07,390
South of the Gyrosphere Valley,
between the old park and the Aviary.

901
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:10,347
-Wait, are you following the dinosaur?
-Yes.

902
01:15:10,348 --> 01:15:12,924
Get ACU out here.
Real guns this time.

903
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:15,960
ACU is airborne.
They took the helicopter.

904
01:15:15,961 --> 01:15:18,501
Who's flying it?

905
01:15:19,769 --> 01:15:22,947
Did you boys serve in the Armed Forces?

906
01:15:22,948 --> 01:15:24,818
Afghanistan, sir.

907
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:27,795
Did your general ever fly
into battle with you?

908
01:15:30,478 --> 01:15:34,441
Got it! Got it.

909
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,063
<i>We have eyes on the target,
south of the Aviary.</i>

910
01:15:38,064 --> 01:15:39,447
<i>Proceed and engage.</i>

911
01:15:39,448 --> 01:15:41,243
Come on!
Look alive, boys!

912
01:15:42,231 --> 01:15:43,786
Look alive!

913
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:54,102
10 o'clock! By the birdcage!

914
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:17,111
No, no, no! No, no, no.

915
01:16:17,112 --> 01:16:19,619
Looks like the fox got in the henhouse.

916
01:16:37,084 --> 01:16:40,223
Pull up! Pull up! Up, up, up!

917
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:15,491
We have a breach in the Aviary.

918
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:38,403
Trees, the trees! Go! Go!

919
01:18:02,776 --> 01:18:04,289
Okay, that's it.

920
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:06,423
We're safe now.

921
01:18:16,006 --> 01:18:19,026
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

922
01:18:19,512 --> 01:18:21,218
Hurry up!

923
01:18:24,327 --> 01:18:25,439
Hey!

924
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,469
-Help!
-Open the gate! Let us in!

925
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,908
-Open it up!
-Come on!

926
01:18:30,909 --> 01:18:32,868
That's a first.

927
01:18:32,869 --> 01:18:34,494
Open the gate!

928
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,577
-Open the gate!
-Let us in!

929
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:49,171
<i>Attention Aviary employees,
there has been a containment breach.</i>

930
01:18:49,172 --> 01:18:50,457
Hello?

931
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:53,722
Claire, we spotted the boys on surveillance.
They're approaching the west gate.

932
01:18:53,723 --> 01:18:54,829
I'm headed there now.

933
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:59,962
Okay, okay. Stay right there.
I'm on my way. Stay right with them.

934
01:18:59,963 --> 01:19:01,072
Hey!

935
01:19:01,073 --> 01:19:02,697
Get on!

936
01:19:16,487 --> 01:19:19,798
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly...</i>

937
01:19:19,799 --> 01:19:22,387
<i>all guests must take shelter immediately.</i>

938
01:19:23,769 --> 01:19:26,742
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly...</i>

939
01:19:26,743 --> 01:19:29,663
<i>all guests must take shelter immediately.</i>

940
01:19:32,443 --> 01:19:35,399
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly...</i>

941
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,787
<i>all guests must take shelter immediately.</i>

942
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:33,916
All units, take position on boardwalk.

943
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:37,277
Use liquid tranquilizers.
Do not fire live ammunition.

944
01:20:37,277 --> 01:20:38,252
Claire, come on!

945
01:20:58,781 --> 01:20:59,994
Stop running!

946
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:15,865
Don't just stand there!

947
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:58,105
Go! Get inside now!

948
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:15,386
Zach!

949
01:22:16,555 --> 01:22:18,138
Gray!

950
01:22:21,855 --> 01:22:24,026
-Aunt Claire!
-Go, go!

951
01:22:24,027 --> 01:22:25,027
Claire!

952
01:22:26,869 --> 01:22:28,296
No! Hold your--

953
01:22:54,127 --> 01:22:55,454
Is that Aunt Claire?

954
01:23:15,654 --> 01:23:18,738
It's them! Zach!

955
01:23:18,739 --> 01:23:20,319
Gray!

956
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,554
Oh, my God! Thank God!
What happened? What is this?

957
01:23:23,555 --> 01:23:24,716
Are you okay?

958
01:23:24,717 --> 01:23:28,738
Where did you go?
Why didn't you come back?

959
01:23:28,739 --> 01:23:31,038
-I was so worried about you.
-Who's that?

960
01:23:36,972 --> 01:23:38,654
We work together.

961
01:23:39,663 --> 01:23:40,540
Hey.

962
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:44,258
-We gotta go.
-Okay. Come on. Come on, come on.

963
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:49,315
Hey, hey!
You guys can't just be walking up in--

964
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:52,599
Simon Masrani's death was a tragedy.

965
01:23:53,451 --> 01:23:57,213
The new mission
is to prevent further loss of life.

966
01:23:57,214 --> 01:23:58,747
Who are these guys?

967
01:23:58,748 --> 01:24:00,077
I'm glad you asked.

968
01:24:00,691 --> 01:24:03,064
You're all relieved of duty.

969
01:24:03,065 --> 01:24:05,064
There's a new team on the ground.

970
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:26,244
Lowery, I'm on my way back to you.

971
01:24:26,245 --> 01:24:27,369
<i>That's a bad idea.</i>

972
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:31,115
The board assigned emergency ops
to iNGen's private security division.

973
01:24:31,115 --> 01:24:32,856
This guy Hoskins is in charge.

974
01:24:32,857 --> 01:24:37,197
And he has this insane plan
to use the Raptors to hunt the Indominus.

975
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:39,171
What do you mean "use the Raptors"?

976
01:24:39,172 --> 01:24:41,628
Son of a bitch!

977
01:24:42,426 --> 01:24:43,791
You shouldn't say "bitch."

978
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:47,439
Take the kids. Get them someplace safe.

979
01:25:03,174 --> 01:25:06,522
-You got this! Damn it, drive!
-Go faster!

980
01:25:12,584 --> 01:25:14,464
This does not feel safe.

981
01:25:14,465 --> 01:25:15,465
Can we stay with you?

982
01:25:15,466 --> 01:25:19,721
-I am never leaving you as long as you live.
-No, no, no. Him.

983
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,035
Yeah, definitely him.

984
01:25:50,258 --> 01:25:52,372
Hey! Right here.

985
01:25:53,323 --> 01:25:55,403
Right here.

986
01:25:55,404 --> 01:25:56,759
She looks at what she wants.

987
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:01,207
Usually what she wants to eat.

988
01:26:19,711 --> 01:26:22,686
The mother hen has finally arrived.

989
01:26:23,857 --> 01:26:29,049
Get the hell out of here
and stay away from my animals.

990
01:26:29,264 --> 01:26:33,142
Hoskins, you wanted this to happen,
you son of a bitch!

991
01:26:33,143 --> 01:26:34,008
Oh, Jesus!

992
01:26:34,009 --> 01:26:38,720
How many more people have to die
before this mission starts to make sense to you?

993
01:26:38,721 --> 01:26:40,026
It's not a mission.

994
01:26:40,027 --> 01:26:41,358
It's a field test.

995
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:44,384
This is an iNGen situation now.

996
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:48,631
Okay, there are gonna be cruise ships
that show up here at first light.

997
01:26:48,632 --> 01:26:50,418
Everybody's gonna get off this island.

998
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:54,428
You're gonna watch a news story tomorrow
about how you all saved lives.

999
01:26:54,429 --> 01:26:55,683
No, no, no, better yet...

1000
01:26:55,684 --> 01:26:58,577
how your animals saved lives.

1001
01:27:00,482 --> 01:27:03,435
They've never been out of containment.
It's crazy.

1002
01:27:03,436 --> 01:27:05,252
Let's move it out!

1003
01:27:06,209 --> 01:27:07,670
This is happening!

1004
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:10,876
With or without you.

1005
01:27:14,678 --> 01:27:17,041
We know that she is in sector five.

1006
01:27:17,042 --> 01:27:20,022
This is a game we call hide-and-seek.
It's a scent drill.

1007
01:27:20,023 --> 01:27:22,214
We've done it about a thousand times
with these animals.

1008
01:27:22,215 --> 01:27:26,022
When they get on target,
and they will get on target...

1009
01:27:26,023 --> 01:27:27,874
wait to engage.

1010
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:31,054
Velociraptors are pack hunters.

1011
01:27:31,055 --> 01:27:33,565
They like to herd the animal into a kill zone.

1012
01:27:33,566 --> 01:27:35,098
That's when we take our shot.

1013
01:27:35,099 --> 01:27:38,737
Get a clear shot, wait on my command
and give her everything you got.

1014
01:27:38,738 --> 01:27:40,906
We got one good target, gentlemen.

1015
01:27:40,907 --> 01:27:43,805
Do not shoot my Raptors.

1016
01:27:43,806 --> 01:27:45,253
Please.

1017
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:47,764
Easy, Blue.

1018
01:27:47,765 --> 01:27:50,404
Easy.

1019
01:27:51,587 --> 01:27:53,154
Attagirl.

1020
01:27:55,449 --> 01:27:57,090
You don't scare me.

1021
01:27:57,262 --> 01:27:58,307
Owen.

1022
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,588
Are they safe?

1023
01:28:05,536 --> 01:28:07,215
No, they're not.

1024
01:28:07,769 --> 01:28:09,366
What are their names?

1025
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,984
Well, you got Charlie.

1026
01:28:11,985 --> 01:28:14,217
There's Echo.
Here is Delta.

1027
01:28:14,749 --> 01:28:18,397
This one's called Blue.
She's the beta.

1028
01:28:18,398 --> 01:28:19,926
Who's the alpha?

1029
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:21,854
You're looking at him, kid.

1030
01:28:26,936 --> 01:28:27,808
See?

1031
01:28:27,809 --> 01:28:29,519
Totally safe.

1032
01:28:30,736 --> 01:28:32,801
All right, get in. Come on.

1033
01:28:32,802 --> 01:28:34,264
Get in there.

1034
01:28:36,764 --> 01:28:39,841
If you need me, I'll be right up front.

1035
01:28:39,842 --> 01:28:41,560
Just open that window.

1036
01:28:41,561 --> 01:28:43,044
Okay?

1037
01:28:43,844 --> 01:28:45,530
Put your seatbelts on.

1038
01:28:48,918 --> 01:28:50,715
Okay, so just...

1039
01:28:50,716 --> 01:28:53,683
hold hands.

1040
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,100
Nothing's getting in here, right?

1041
01:29:18,224 --> 01:29:19,233
Hey.

1042
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:26,335
Do you remember that ghost at the old house?
Remember the one in the garage?

1043
01:29:27,618 --> 01:29:29,137
I protected you, right?

1044
01:29:31,576 --> 01:29:35,512
You made a battle axe
out of a ruler and a paper plate.

1045
01:29:35,513 --> 01:29:39,710
Yeah. See, nothing is gonna get you
while I'm around, okay?

1046
01:29:40,903 --> 01:29:43,234
But you're not always gonna be around.

1047
01:29:44,161 --> 01:29:45,730
Yeah, well...

1048
01:29:46,599 --> 01:29:47,727
Hey.

1049
01:29:47,728 --> 01:29:51,300
We're brothers, okay?

1050
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:54,582
We'll always be brothers and
we'll always come back to one another.

1051
01:29:57,279 --> 01:29:58,843
No matter what.

1052
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:01,226
No matter what?

1053
01:30:01,227 --> 01:30:03,067
No matter what.

1054
01:30:25,157 --> 01:30:26,398
Awesome.

1055
01:30:39,548 --> 01:30:40,479
Here we go.

1056
01:31:52,397 --> 01:31:54,422
Your boyfriend's a badass.

1057
01:32:07,386 --> 01:32:09,867
Imagine if we had these puppies
in Tora Bora.

1058
01:32:12,741 --> 01:32:14,652
Are you recording this thing?

1059
01:32:26,962 --> 01:32:28,282
They're slowing down.

1060
01:32:29,317 --> 01:32:30,996
They got something.

1061
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:52,059
You know what? No, no, no.
You guys are not gonna watch this.

1062
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,337
Keep the window closed.

1063
01:33:29,423 --> 01:33:31,006
Something's wrong.

1064
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:33,615
They're communicating.

1065
01:33:40,572 --> 01:33:43,881
I know why they wouldn't tell us
what it's made of.

1066
01:33:43,882 --> 01:33:45,136
Why?

1067
01:33:49,507 --> 01:33:52,426
That thing's part Raptor.

1068
01:33:59,428 --> 01:34:01,970
What's taking them so long?
Light it up!

1069
01:34:01,971 --> 01:34:02,971
Engage!

1070
01:34:17,592 --> 01:34:18,839
Oh, my God.

1071
01:34:30,469 --> 01:34:31,946
Watch your six.

1072
01:34:31,947 --> 01:34:34,465
Raptors got a new alpha.

1073
01:35:56,384 --> 01:35:57,894
To the vehicles now!

1074
01:35:57,895 --> 01:35:59,789
Fall back!

1075
01:36:21,879 --> 01:36:22,635
No!

1076
01:36:22,636 --> 01:36:24,032
Blue!

1077
01:36:37,722 --> 01:36:39,108
Oh, my God.

1078
01:36:39,109 --> 01:36:41,278
Is everybody dead?

1079
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:44,147
No, no, no. Everyone is fine.

1080
01:36:44,148 --> 01:36:45,162
Don't lie to him.

1081
01:36:45,163 --> 01:36:47,921
He's scared.
It's okay to lie when people are scared.

1082
01:36:47,922 --> 01:36:49,322
I wanna go home.

1083
01:36:49,323 --> 01:36:51,498
Sweetheart, you will, okay? I promise.

1084
01:36:51,499 --> 01:36:53,188
Tomorrow you will be home...

1085
01:36:53,189 --> 01:36:56,636
and your mother will
never let me see you again.

1086
01:36:57,506 --> 01:36:59,228
Get out of here! Go!

1087
01:37:03,701 --> 01:37:05,047
They're coming!

1088
01:37:15,219 --> 01:37:17,485
Just hold on back there.

1089
01:38:06,616 --> 01:38:08,615
-Turn it on.
-I don't know how.

1090
01:38:21,307 --> 01:38:22,441
Are you boys okay?

1091
01:38:22,442 --> 01:38:24,803
Hey, did you see that?

1092
01:38:24,804 --> 01:38:26,215
I can't wait to tell Mom.

1093
01:38:26,929 --> 01:38:30,190
Please, no.
Do not tell your mother about that, ever.

1094
01:38:33,178 --> 01:38:35,050
-Owen!
-Owen!

1095
01:38:39,516 --> 01:38:41,684
We gotta get indoors.
Follow me.

1096
01:38:47,306 --> 01:38:50,479
Lowery, we're headed your way.
Call in a chopper.

1097
01:39:03,831 --> 01:39:05,922
Everything must be accounted for.

1098
01:39:06,728 --> 01:39:08,952
I want all backup generators online.

1099
01:39:14,705 --> 01:39:16,069
Where have you been?

1100
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:19,431
Change of plans.
Mission took a jog to the left.

1101
01:39:19,432 --> 01:39:20,930
I'm taking everything off-site.

1102
01:39:20,931 --> 01:39:22,533
The embryos are safe here.

1103
01:39:22,534 --> 01:39:24,841
<i>They can live up to eight weeks
on the generators.</i>

1104
01:39:24,842 --> 01:39:28,613
No, no. You listen.
The park's gonna be Chapter 11 by morning.

1105
01:39:28,614 --> 01:39:31,357
<i>Okay, our little side project's
about to get a shot in the arm.</i>

1106
01:39:31,358 --> 01:39:34,161
I don't want a bunch of lawyers messing
around with something that they don't understand.

1107
01:39:34,162 --> 01:39:36,278
<i>You get it?</i>

1108
01:39:36,279 --> 01:39:39,745
Hey!
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

1109
01:39:41,751 --> 01:39:45,603
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like to thank you for your patience.</i>

1110
01:39:45,604 --> 01:39:49,628
<i>The next ferry will be leaving in 45 minutes.</i>

1111
01:39:49,629 --> 01:39:54,414
<i>If you require immediate medical attention,
please report to the nearest health service station.</i>

1112
01:39:54,415 --> 01:39:56,150
Is this what you had in mind?

1113
01:39:56,151 --> 01:39:58,770
Okay, people.
We have an extraction point at the east dock.

1114
01:40:02,587 --> 01:40:03,322
Hey.

1115
01:40:03,323 --> 01:40:05,468
They said we had to evacuate.
There's a boat.

1116
01:40:05,469 --> 01:40:06,939
You coming?

1117
01:40:15,012 --> 01:40:16,859
Someone has to stay behind.

1118
01:40:21,793 --> 01:40:24,349
No. I have a boyfriend.

1119
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:28,177
I didn't know that you guys
were, like, together-together.

1120
01:40:28,178 --> 01:40:29,367
We are.

1121
01:40:29,368 --> 01:40:31,826
That's good.
You don't mention him, ever.

1122
01:40:31,827 --> 01:40:32,934
No, I'm at work.

1123
01:40:32,935 --> 01:40:34,509
No, no, no. Yeah.

1124
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:37,667
-Well...
-Yeah, okay.

1125
01:40:37,668 --> 01:40:38,643
-Great.
-Great.

1126
01:40:38,643 --> 01:40:39,611
-Okay.
-Okay.

1127
01:40:39,612 --> 01:40:41,117
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

1128
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,043
Okay, bye.

1129
01:40:51,925 --> 01:40:53,551
Where's Hoskins?

1130
01:40:53,552 --> 01:40:56,429
He's sending you
and the assets to a secure location.

1131
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:58,355
But our deal is still intact?

1132
01:40:58,356 --> 01:41:01,364
Don't worry. You'll be well
taken care of. Let's go!

1133
01:41:07,913 --> 01:41:10,661
<i>Thank you for visiting Jurassic World.</i>

1134
01:41:10,662 --> 01:41:12,755
<i>We hope you enjoyed your adventure.</i>

1135
01:41:12,756 --> 01:41:15,675
<i>Don't forget to visit the gift shop,
and remember...</i>

1136
01:41:15,676 --> 01:41:19,353
<i>It's always happy hour at Margaritaville.</i>

1137
01:41:22,353 --> 01:41:24,735
Come on, come on.
Go inside.

1138
01:41:32,187 --> 01:41:34,257
Control room. That way.

1139
01:41:44,756 --> 01:41:46,579
They evacuated the lab.

1140
01:42:27,336 --> 01:42:28,525
What are you doing?

1141
01:42:28,526 --> 01:42:31,320
I'm afraid that's
above your pay grade, honey.

1142
01:42:32,697 --> 01:42:34,316
Where's Henry?

1143
01:42:35,248 --> 01:42:37,266
Dr. Wu works for us.

1144
01:42:38,056 --> 01:42:39,987
That's not a real dinosaur.

1145
01:42:40,963 --> 01:42:42,901
No, it ain't, kid.

1146
01:42:44,346 --> 01:42:48,092
But somebody's gotta make sure
that this company has a future.

1147
01:42:48,093 --> 01:42:49,975
Imagine...

1148
01:42:49,976 --> 01:42:54,409
that one, a fraction of the size...

1149
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:54,947
deadly...

1150
01:42:54,948 --> 01:42:56,337
intelligent...

1151
01:42:56,338 --> 01:43:00,647
able to hide from the most advanced
military technology.

1152
01:43:00,648 --> 01:43:03,987
A living weapon unlike anything
we've ever seen.

1153
01:43:03,988 --> 01:43:09,523
You see? Millions of years of evolution...
what did we learn?

1154
01:43:11,549 --> 01:43:14,088
Nature is the gift that just--

1155
01:43:14,089 --> 01:43:15,567
Oh, shit!

1156
01:43:18,211 --> 01:43:19,368
Easy.

1157
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:22,196
Easy, boy.

1158
01:43:22,197 --> 01:43:25,450
Easy. Hey, hey.

1159
01:43:27,626 --> 01:43:30,850
We're on the same side, right?
Right?

1160
01:43:32,814 --> 01:43:33,956
Easy.

1161
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:36,620
Easy.

1162
01:43:36,621 --> 01:43:38,904
I'm on your side.

1163
01:43:47,644 --> 01:43:49,949
No, boys. This way.
Come on.

1164
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:50,950
Come on. Come on.

1165
01:44:26,819 --> 01:44:28,420
That's how it is, huh?

1166
01:44:45,295 --> 01:44:46,983
Easy.

1167
01:44:51,168 --> 01:44:52,624
Easy.

1168
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,955
That's it.

1169
01:46:12,837 --> 01:46:15,073
24, 50.

1170
01:46:16,025 --> 01:46:17,127
We need more.

1171
01:46:18,744 --> 01:46:19,653
More what?

1172
01:46:19,654 --> 01:46:22,717
Teeth. We need more teeth.

1173
01:46:32,335 --> 01:46:34,949
Okay, so, you just wait here.

1174
01:46:36,217 --> 01:46:37,817
It's gonna be fine.

1175
01:47:26,156 --> 01:47:27,676
Lowery, are you still there?

1176
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:29,620
Hey, where are you?

1177
01:47:29,621 --> 01:47:31,630
I need you to open Paddock 9.

1178
01:47:32,417 --> 01:47:33,619
Paddock 9?

1179
01:47:35,267 --> 01:47:36,407
You kidding?

1180
01:47:41,225 --> 01:47:44,593
Damn it, Lowery, be a man
and do something for once in your life.

1181
01:47:44,594 --> 01:47:46,618
Why did you have to make it personal?

1182
01:50:01,264 --> 01:50:02,770
Run!

1183
01:50:03,225 --> 01:50:05,449
Go! Go, go!

1184
01:53:33,071 --> 01:53:35,509
Oh, my God, it's your parents.
It's your parents.

1185
01:53:36,654 --> 01:53:38,600
Come on, come on.

1186
01:53:41,848 --> 01:53:47,542
Are you okay? Oh, baby.

1187
01:53:54,376 --> 01:53:55,884
I'm so sorry.

1188
01:53:57,604 --> 01:53:59,467
Are you okay?

1189
01:54:03,665 --> 01:54:04,453
Come here.

1190
01:54:06,836 --> 01:54:08,276
Sweetie.

1191
01:54:25,581 --> 01:54:27,468
So, what do we do now?

1192
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:30,735
Probably stick together.

1193
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:34,257
For survival.
