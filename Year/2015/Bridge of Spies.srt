1
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:43,959
<i>The next stop is Broad Street.</i>

2
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:45,327
<i>Broad Street will be next.</i>

3
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:58,267
Upstairs. This way.

4
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:09,211
He didn't come up this way?
Anything?

5
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:11,013
He's not up here.
Go back down.

6
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:14,950
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

7
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:36,271
Go ahead and park
around the corner.

8
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:51,266
Visitors.

9
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,667
Do you mind
if I fetch my teeth?

10
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,636
Colonel, would you
turn around, please?

11
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,740
Sit down on the bed.

12
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,242
Let's go.

13
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,586
Uh, they're in the...
The teeth are in the...
On the sink.

14
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,455
Look at me. We are agents

15
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,590
from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

16
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:16,691
Look at me!

17
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:18,493
I'm talking to you.

18
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,328
We've received information

19
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:22,631
concerning your
involvement in espionage.

20
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:24,666
You can either cooperate
with us right now,

21
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:26,301
or you'll be under arrest.

22
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:27,269
Do you understand, Colonel?

23
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,237
No, not really.

24
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:32,574
Why do you
keep calling me "Colonel"?

25
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,376
You need
to get dressed.

26
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,444
We have to search
your apartment.

27
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:40,549
Would you mind if I, uh,
cleaned my palette?

28
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:43,385
The paints,
it'll get ruined otherwise.

29
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:44,753
It's just behind you there.

30
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,723
I have a cloth myself.

31
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:49,824
Thank you.

32
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:52,594
All right, start searching the place.
Thank you.

33
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:53,762
All right,
search the mattress,

34
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:55,030
the bed, the floorboards,
his chair.

35
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:57,332
Would you put that
in the ashtray on the windowsill there?

36
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:58,900
Take a good look
at that desk.

37
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:04,239
Let's see the desk.

38
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:12,581
Wouldn't want
to get this ruined.

39
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:29,297
<i>Don't say "my guy."</i>

40
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:32,334
<i>He's not "my guy."</i>

41
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,403
Yes, he's "your guy."
Who are we talking about?

42
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:39,374
We're talking about a guy
who was insured by my client.

43
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,376
So, don't make him "my guy."

44
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:43,912
Okay, fine.

45
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:47,515
My point is, the guy
insured by your client,

46
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,318
he doesn't deny that
any of these things happened.

47
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:52,887
"These... These things"?

48
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:55,557
Yes,
these five things.

49
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,359
Wait, hold it,
hold it, hold it.

50
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:58,660
Not five things.

51
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,662
One thing.

52
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:01,796
Clearly,
it's five things.

53
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,565
Well, I'm sorry,
it's not clear to me.

54
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:06,401
Five things?
Explain it to me.

55
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:07,669
It's self-evident.

56
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:09,571
Okay, then tell me
what happened.

57
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:12,941
Tell me the story in a way
that makes sense for five things.

58
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:15,377
Fine, absolutely.
Your guy is...

59
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,745
Not my guy.
Insured by my client.

60
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:18,413
The guy insured
by your client

61
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:19,914
is driving down
State Highway 19

62
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:22,550
when he loses control
of his car and hits my five guys,

63
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,686
the five guys who hired me
to represent them

64
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,154
because you're not
honoring your claim.

65
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:29,891
You mean my client is not
honoring the claim, the insurance company?

66
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,560
Mr. Donovan,
we're all clear on who's who, here.

67
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,397
Except my client
honors every claim.

68
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,531
They do, Mr. Bates.

69
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:37,899
Every single
legitimate claim,

70
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,567
up to the limit
of their liability,

71
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,736
which is $100,000
per accident,

72
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,905
in the case of
this man's policy.

73
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,106
And this is one claim.

74
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,843
According to your description,
"He hit my five guys."

75
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:51,880
The guy insured by my client
had one accident.

76
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,148
One, one, one.

77
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:56,718
Losing control of the car and
hitting five motorcyclists.

78
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,953
From their point of view,
five things happened.

79
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:02,824
Well, look, Bob.
May I? Bob?

80
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:05,927
"Jim."

81
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,730
If I go bowling and I throw
a strike, one thing happened.

82
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:09,831
Ten things didn't happen.

83
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:11,900
Jim, my guys
aren't bowling pins,

84
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,635
as much as your guy
may have treated them as such.

85
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:14,969
If... Let me finish.
Let me finish.

86
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:17,806
If your house
is insured for $100,000

87
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,841
and a tornado
carries it away,

88
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:21,543
it carried away one house.

89
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,011
It didn't pick up
every stick of furniture

90
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:25,714
and destroy it
in a separate incident.

91
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:28,483
If that is
what you're saying,

92
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:31,753
well, then there is never
any limit to our liability

93
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:34,789
and that is the end
of the insurance business.

94
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,991
And then, Bob,
nobody is safe.

95
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:44,899
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.
How may I direct your call?

96
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:46,568
Morning, Mr. Donovan.

97
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,902
Good morning, Alison.

98
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,871
I moved your 9:00 a.m.
with Prudential, sir.

99
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,005
Why did you do that?

100
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,607
I asked her to.

101
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:54,876
Is everything
all right, Tom?

102
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,579
Why don't you leave your stuff with Alison.
Come on inside.

103
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,014
Something pretty important
has come up.

104
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:01,783
Somebody's here to see us.

105
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:03,651
Natalie's getting
your coffee.

106
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:06,454
Nescafe, cream, two lumps,
right?

107
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:07,756
That's right. Thanks.

108
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:11,025
Lynn!
Jim!

109
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,927
Nice to see you again.
How's the family?

110
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,763
Great, good. Thanks.
How's Annie?

111
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:17,031
Homicidal. We had
the in-laws for the holiday.

112
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:19,305
Well, if she acts on it,
she'll have good representation.

113
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:21,636
Now, what's up?

114
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:29,978
Okay, here's the thing.

115
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:33,515
The Soviet spy they caught,
we want you to defend him.

116
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:34,816
Here's the indictment.

117
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,020
Wow.

118
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,757
I'm not sure
I wanna pick that up.

119
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,826
The accused
doesn't know any lawyers.

120
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:46,795
The federal court
tossed it into our lap.

121
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:50,031
The Bar Committee took a vote.

122
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,866
You're the unanimous choice.

123
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,501
It was important to us...

124
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,836
It's important
to our country, Jim,

125
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,805
that this man is seen
as getting a fair shake.

126
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:58,840
American justice
will be on trial.

127
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,775
Well, of course,
when you put it that way,

128
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,777
it's an honor to be asked.

129
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,712
But, Lynn,
I'm an insurance lawyer.

130
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,681
I haven't done
criminal work in years.

131
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,716
It's like riding a bike,
isn't it?

132
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,819
You distinguished yourself
at Nuremberg.

133
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,554
I was on
the prosecution team.

134
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:13,822
Not the point.

135
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,215
You're no stranger
to criminal law.

136
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,892
Jim, look at the situation.

137
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:19,961
The man is publicly reviled.

138
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:20,995
And I will be, too.

139
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,864
Yes, in more
ignorant quarters.

140
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:24,732
But that's exactly why
this has to be done,

141
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,835
and capably done.

142
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,837
It can't look like
our justice system

143
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,030
tosses people
on the ash heap.

144
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,846
Suppose I did,
what's the evidence look like?

145
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,615
Pretty overwhelming.

146
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,117
Great. Great.

147
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:45,787
Everyone will hate me
but at least I'll lose.

148
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:50,024
Well, what do
you think, Tom?

149
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,727
The firm will suffer.
I have work here.

150
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,796
I think
it's a patriotic duty.

151
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,798
It's an important mission.

152
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:59,033
I told Lynn,
the firm can't say no,

153
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,135
and you'd have a tough time
saying no, too.

154
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:05,607
I think you have to defend
the son of a bitch.

155
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,642
So, you're doing it?

156
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,010
Doing what?

157
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:12,046
Defending Abel,
the Soviet spy.

158
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,381
I may. I have to speak to...

159
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,050
Wait, how do you know?
Did they post it on the bulletin board?

160
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,152
No, I... I was
talking to Richard Earl...

161
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:20,088
Look, if I do this,
I'm going to need your help.

162
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:24,893
Can you work tonight?

163
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,001
Well, I have
a dinner date, sir.

164
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,902
It's Tuesday, right?
Yeah, no, I'm free, completely free.

165
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,036
Thank you, sir.

166
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:40,909
But it's also an honor.

167
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,044
And the Bar Association
asked me

168
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,846
because they want
to show that even a spy

169
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,648
gets a capable advocate.

170
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,816
Well, maybe it's the kind of honor
we could do without.

171
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,250
Hey, honey,
what are you doing home?

172
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:52,653
I got stood up.

173
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:56,157
Well, that's despicable.

174
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,759
Who is this knot-head?

175
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:58,960
I'd rather not say.

176
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:01,129
Well, sit down.
We just started.

177
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,330
People are scared.

178
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:04,198
They're building
bomb shelters to protect themselves

179
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:06,634
from people like this man.

180
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:07,835
I go to the store,

181
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:11,172
people are buying
canned food and potassium tablets.

182
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,008
It's all about this man
and what he represents.

183
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:16,110
He's a threat to all of us.
A traitor.

184
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,946
Who's a traitor?
The Rosenbergs were traitors.

185
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:18,880
Who were they?

186
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:20,982
They gave atomic secrets
to the Russians.

187
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:22,984
They were Americans.
They betrayed their country.

188
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:25,086
You can't accuse Abel
of being a traitor.

189
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,654
He's not an American.

190
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:28,056
Oh, listen to yourself.

191
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,724
You're defending him already.

192
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:30,792
You're rehearsing it on me.

193
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,827
You said you were
just thinking about taking it.

194
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,730
I am just thinking about it,
just very hard.

195
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:38,700
Everyone deserves a defense.
Every person matters.

196
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,034
Jim, what do we deserve?

197
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,003
Do you know how
people will look at us?

198
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,205
The family of a man
trying to free a traitor?

199
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,140
He's not a traitor, Mary.
Yes, yes.

200
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:47,709
Roger, get that! He's not a traitor...

201
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:48,977
Why do I have to do
all the work?

202
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,812
Oh! You wait till we say grace.
I'm hungry!

203
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,213
He's about the most unpopular
man in this country,

204
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:53,848
and you're trying
to take second place!

205
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,283
Yeah, and I'm third.

206
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,285
Carol, you just dated the wrong guy.
I wanna eat.

207
00:16:57,318 --> 00:16:58,853
Mary, don't make
this an argument

208
00:16:58,886 --> 00:16:59,887
when we're not having
an argument.

209
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,189
You're against him,
I'm for him?

210
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:04,025
No, I'm not for him.
I'm not for the Russians spying on us.

211
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:07,028
I'm for his right to have a defense
in a court of law,

212
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:09,063
which is why they call it
a court of law.

213
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:10,965
I didn't mean
to interrupt dinner.

214
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,200
A court of law...
Hey, Doug.

215
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:16,904
Oh, no, not at all.
Hello, Doug.
Jim was just flailing.

216
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:19,173
I'm not flailing.
Go ahead, Doug, you can join us for dinner.

217
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,009
We're having
meatloaf tonight.

218
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:25,813
So, you came over
to help Jim think about

219
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,048
whether he's
taking the case?

220
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:29,951
Oh, we're taking it!
It's exciting, isn't it?

221
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,794
Lord, we thank thee
for thy blessings

222
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,229
we are about to receive.

223
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:43,798
Thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

224
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,341
Good morning, sir.
My name is Jim Donovan.

225
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:55,343
These are my credentials.

226
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,812
I am a partner in
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.

227
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:01,215
I was admitted to
the New York Bar in 1941.

228
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:09,123
You have been charged
with three counts and 19 overt acts.

229
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:11,826
Conspiracy to transmit
United States defense

230
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,361
and atomic secrets
to the Soviet Union,

231
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:15,129
conspiracy to
gather secrets,

232
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,298
and failing to register
as a foreign agent.

233
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:25,339
Do many foreign
agents register?

234
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:32,847
If you don't mind
my asking, sir,

235
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:37,085
since your arrest,
where have you been?

236
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,056
I couldn't say for certain.

237
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:45,425
You don't know?

238
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,996
They drove me to an airport

239
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,165
and put me on a plane,
took me off the plane.

240
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:54,836
Somewhere hot.

241
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:57,071
It's hot here.

242
00:18:57,105 --> 00:19:00,041
Hotter, very humid.

243
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:02,009
They put me in a room.

244
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,246
Were you beaten?

245
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,281
No.

246
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:09,283
I was talked to.

247
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,385
Offers were made.

248
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,487
What do you mean?

249
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,023
Offers of employment,
to work for your government.

250
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,962
I was told if I cooperated,

251
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,164
no further charges
would be made against me.

252
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:26,000
And I would be given money.

253
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,436
Hmm.

254
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,037
And you declined?

255
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,908
As you see.

256
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:36,310
Well, of course
I can't endorse that.

257
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,279
I feel duty-bound
to urge you

258
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,414
to cooperate with
the U.S. government.

259
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:41,849
Well, I said no.

260
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:45,086
Perhaps you could relay
to your friends at the CIA that I meant it.

261
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,121
No, no, no.

262
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:49,090
I... I don't work
for the agency.

263
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:53,060
I don't work
for the government.

264
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:56,330
I am here to offer my services
as your legal counsel.

265
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:59,200
If you accept them
as such,

266
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:01,969
I work for you.

267
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,438
If I accept you?

268
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:13,047
Are you good at what you do?

269
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:17,084
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

270
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,191
Have you represented
many accused spies?

271
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:27,895
No, not yet.

272
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,999
This will be a first
for the both of us.

273
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:36,938
Yes.

274
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,008
All right.

275
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,476
"All right"?
You accept?

276
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,447
Yes, all right.

277
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,983
Good, okay.

278
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,151
Let's start here.

279
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,319
If you are firm
in your resolve

280
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:52,954
not to cooperate
with the U.S. government...

281
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:54,088
I am.

282
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,523
Yeah.

283
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,391
Then do not talk
to anybody else about your case,

284
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,126
inside of government or out.

285
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,263
Except to me,
to the extent that you trust me.

286
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:04,298
I have a mandate to serve you.
Nobody else does.

287
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:06,100
Quite frankly,
everybody else has an interest

288
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,573
in sending you
to the electric chair.

289
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:09,269
All right.

290
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,242
You don't seem alarmed.

291
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,182
Would it help?

292
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:35,529
I... I would like
materials to draw with.

293
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:37,031
That's not possible.

294
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:40,001
A pencil, a piece of paper.

295
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:41,235
Cigarettes.

296
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,206
Please?

297
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:55,416
Mr. Donovan,
you have men like me

298
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:58,019
doing the same
for your country.

299
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,489
If they were caught,

300
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:04,425
I'm sure that you would
wish them to be treated well.

301
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:10,364
What's your name?

302
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:12,033
Francis Gary Powers.

303
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:16,070
Rank, service?

304
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,306
First Lieutenant,
United States Air Force.

305
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,076
Do you have any association

306
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,111
with the Soviet Union,
Lieutenant Powers?

307
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:25,346
Kidding?

308
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,547
Just answer the questions,
Lieutenant.

309
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,150
Yes, no,
or as simply as you can.

310
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,352
Do you have any association
with the Soviet Union?

311
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:33,087
Hell, no.

312
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:36,090
Do you know
why you're here?

313
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:37,291
Mmm-mmm.

314
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:40,394
Is that a no?

315
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:42,630
Yes. I mean...

316
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,532
No, it's just "no."

317
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:47,101
Yes, I have absolutely
no idea why I'm here.

318
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,302
Eyes front, Lieutenant.

319
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:49,470
Yes, sir.

320
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:08,456
How'd you do in there, Gary?

321
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,194
Pretty good.
Think I got my name right.

322
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,163
You probably
outscored Shinn, then.

323
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:19,066
Who's winning?

324
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,334
Uh, that would be me.

325
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:22,303
Oh. Well, deal me in.

326
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:24,538
So, these are
all mine, then.

327
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:26,407
I told you boys
not to play with him.

328
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,269
Okay, drivers,
here's the deal.

329
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,606
You've been selected
for a mission

330
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,174
which you are
not to discuss

331
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,476
with anyone
outside of this room.

332
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,245
No one.

333
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,313
I don't care who you trust.

334
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:08,315
Wife, mother, sweetheart.

335
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,317
The good Lord
when you pray at night.

336
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:12,286
You don't tell
any of them anything

337
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,121
of what
I'm about to tell you.

338
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:19,360
Each of you drivers has
met certain qualifications.

339
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,430
High level
security clearance.

340
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,231
Exceptional pilot ratings

341
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:26,233
in excess of
the required hours flight time

342
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,202
in a single-seat aircraft.

343
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:31,205
We are engaged in a war.

344
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,474
This war does not, for the moment,
involve men-at-arms.

345
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:35,376
It involves information.

346
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:37,611
You will be
collecting information.

347
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:40,481
You will be gathering
intelligence about the enemy.

348
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:44,151
The intelligence you gather
could give us the upper hand

349
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,720
in a full thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union.

350
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:50,191
Or it could prevent one.

351
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,727
For public purposes,

352
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,529
as far as your wife or mother

353
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:57,531
or sweetheart
or the good Lord above,

354
00:24:57,565 --> 00:24:59,567
your mission does not exist.

355
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,436
If it does not exist,
you do not exist.

356
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,573
You cannot be shot down.
You cannot be captured.

357
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:13,647
You work for the CIA now.

358
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,397
So, Jim, I heard your guy is
speaking with a phony accent.

359
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,501
Does he keep that up
all the time?

360
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,270
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's just the way he talks.

361
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:38,405
He's got the Russian name
but a British passport.

362
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:41,342
Well, I doubt
that that's genuine.

363
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,644
So, Jim, where are we?
I see here...

364
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:46,280
Yes, uh, Judge, you see,

365
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:50,684
I just don't think that three weeks
is going to do it, here.

366
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,686
We... We got a massive amount
of evidence, as you know.

367
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,787
You wanna postpone?

368
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:54,989
Six weeks.

369
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:58,492
I mean, there's just myself
and my associate, basically.

370
00:25:58,526 --> 00:25:59,727
Jim, is this serious?

371
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,761
Sir?

372
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,599
Is this serious?

373
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,268
Yes. Yes, indeed, it is.

374
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,702
You can see
in the filing...

375
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:11,572
Jim, this man is a Soviet spy.

376
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,275
Allegedly.
Come on, Counselor!

377
00:26:15,843 --> 00:26:17,344
Your Honor.

378
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:18,779
Of course, I salute you.

379
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:21,348
We all salute you for
taking on a thankless task.

380
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:23,250
This man has to have
due process.

381
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,552
But let's not kid each other.

382
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:28,589
He'll receive
a capable defense.

383
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:32,326
And, God willing,
he'll be convicted.

384
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,727
Come on, Counselor.

385
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:35,296
Let's not play games
with this.

386
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:37,431
Not in my courtroom.

387
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,466
We have a date

388
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,335
and we're going to trial.

389
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:52,479
Taxi!

390
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:54,281
Taxi!

391
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:57,284
I see your light on!
Son of a bitch.

392
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:01,355
Can't wait to get back
to Manhattan.

393
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:02,590
His light was on, right?

394
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,559
Son of a bitch.

395
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:54,408
Against their
level of comfort.

396
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:55,509
The statute hasn't changed.

397
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:56,944
Oh, excuse me, sir.

398
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:58,646
Pardon me. Sorry. Oh!

399
00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:31,645
Mr. Donovan.

400
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:35,649
What?

401
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:40,587
What?

402
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,868
CIA.

403
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:55,902
Yeah.

404
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:57,971
I just wanted to chat.

405
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:03,777
How's the case going?

406
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:06,580
Case is going great.
Couldn't be better.

407
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:07,681
Mmm-hmm.

408
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:09,717
Has your guy talked?

409
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:16,690
Excuse me.

410
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:19,460
You met him. Has he talked?
Has he said anything yet?

411
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,564
We're not having
this conversation.

412
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,699
No, of course not.

413
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:27,901
No, I mean,
we really are not having it.

414
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:31,638
You're asking me to violate
attorney-client privilege.

415
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:32,940
Oh, come on, Counselor.

416
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:33,941
You know,
I wish people like you

417
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,042
would quit saying
"Oh, come on, Counselor."

418
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:36,944
I didn't like it the first
time it happened today.

419
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,779
A judge said it to me twice.

420
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:40,814
And the more I hear it,
the more I don't like it.

421
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,687
Okay, well, listen,
I understand attorney-client privilege.

422
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,923
I understand
all the legal gamesmanship.

423
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:52,659
And I understand
that's how you make a living.

424
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:55,562
But I'm talking to you
about something else.

425
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:59,666
The security
of your country.

426
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,836
And I'm sorry
if the way I put it offends you.

427
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,540
But we need to know
what Abel is telling you.

428
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:08,642
You understand me, Donovan?

429
00:30:08,675 --> 00:30:10,711
We need to know.

430
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:12,513
Don't go "Boy Scout" on me.

431
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,783
We don't have
a rule book, here.

432
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,086
You're Agent Hoffman, yeah?

433
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,988
Yeah.

434
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:23,090
German extraction.

435
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:24,558
Yeah, so?

436
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:26,493
My name's Donovan. Irish.

437
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:28,929
Both sides,
mother and father.

438
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:32,099
I'm Irish, you're German.

439
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:34,968
But what makes us
both Americans?

440
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,070
Just one thing.

441
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:38,739
One, one, one.

442
00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:40,873
The rule book.

443
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,777
We call it the Constitution

444
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:45,779
and we agree to the rules,

445
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:47,581
and that's what
makes us Americans.

446
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:48,749
It's all that
makes us Americans

447
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:49,850
so don't tell me
there's no rule book,

448
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:52,486
and don't nod at me like that,
you son of a bitch.

449
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,032
Do we need to
worry about you?

450
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,503
Not if I'm left alone
to do my job.

451
00:31:24,585 --> 00:31:25,819
From this moment forward

452
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:28,589
you will not refer to the U-2
as a spy plane

453
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:30,624
or reconnaissance aircraft.

454
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,893
You will refer to it
as <i>"The Article."</i>

455
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:36,063
<i>The Article</i>
has an 80-foot wingspan.

456
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:41,602
It's powered by a single Pratt and Whitney
J57 P-37 engine.

457
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:44,004
10,000 pounds of thrust

458
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:48,075
and a maximum speed
of 430 miles an hour.

459
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:49,843
She may not be quick,

460
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:52,779
but at your cruising altitude
of 70,000 feet,

461
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,615
nothing will
come close to you.

462
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:55,782
70,000?

463
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:58,785
The idea is the enemy doesn't
even know you're there.

464
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:00,687
It looks kind of flimsy.

465
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,694
Every extra pound of weight
costs a foot in altitude,

466
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:09,563
and we need
to accommodate the cameras.

467
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:15,669
That's a 4,500-millimeter
lens, times three.

468
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:18,005
A pin-sharp
panoramic camera

469
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:22,676
four times as powerful as any aerial
reconnaissance cameras we've ever used.

470
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:25,913
You're gonna be taking
pictures, lots of pictures.

471
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,215
At 70,000 feet,
<i>The Article</i> can photograph

472
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:32,185
2,000 square miles
of territory in one pass.

473
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:33,954
Now, drivers,

474
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:37,124
give Agent Sumner
your undivided attention.

475
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:41,228
The items you will need
on your mission are over here.

476
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:43,964
B camera,
Revere 8 model 40 magazine,

477
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,833
Keystone Capri K-25, silver.

478
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:48,835
Hollow-handle shaving brush.

479
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:52,005
Complete set of cipher tables
on edible silver foil.

480
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,874
Specialist photographic
equipment.

481
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:58,779
Yeah, we, uh...
We get the idea. Thank you.

482
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:14,027
Uh, excuse me,
Agent, uh, Bosco. "Blasco."

483
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,896
Sir.

484
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:20,934
There seems to be
a subsection to this list here.

485
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:22,970
Well, most of this stuff
came from his studio,

486
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,163
but the rest is from the
hotel room he was holed up in.

487
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:26,807
Where we found him.

488
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:30,243
The hotel room you searched?

489
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:32,045
Well, yeah.

490
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,147
Can I see the warrant?

491
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,782
The what?

492
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:39,753
Yeah, explain this to me.
There was a warrant.

493
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:41,121
There was a warrant.

494
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:43,223
A civil detention writ
for the arrest of an alien,

495
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:45,125
but there was
no search warrant

496
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,960
for suspicion
of criminal activity.

497
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:48,228
So, the search
and the evidence

498
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:49,997
that is
the fruit of that search,

499
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,132
that's all tainted
and should not be admitted.

500
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,901
What protections is he due,
Your Honor? The man is not...

501
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,771
The man is what?
He's Rudolf Ivanovich Abel.

502
00:33:57,804 --> 00:33:59,706
He is a Soviet citizen.

503
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,008
He's not an American.

504
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:05,178
1886,
<i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins.</i>

505
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:08,315
The court held that even aliens,
in that case Chinese immigrants,

506
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:11,718
could not be held to answer for a crime
without due process of law,

507
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:13,912
including any alien that entered
the country illegally.

508
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,789
The Department of Justice

509
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:19,059
has its first allegiance
to the United States.

510
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,194
I don't see how an alien,
if he's here illegally,

511
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:24,097
how he suffered
deprivation of rights.

512
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:25,932
Rights as what?

513
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:27,801
An American?

514
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:30,971
Rights as what, Counselor?

515
00:34:31,004 --> 00:34:32,806
We're in a battle
for civilization.

516
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,043
This Russian spy came here
to threaten our way of life.

517
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,145
Now, I have a courtroom
of people waiting.

518
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:40,180
Get out there,
sit beside the Russian.

519
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:42,349
Let's get this
over and done with.

520
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,818
And your motion is denied.

521
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,756
He should take some
insurance out on himself.

522
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,358
How did we do?

523
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:52,826
In there?

524
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:55,228
Uh...

525
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,230
Not too good.

526
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,266
Apparently, you're not
an American citizen.

527
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,234
That's true.

528
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,036
And according
to your boss,

529
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,738
you're not
a Soviet citizen either.

530
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,075
Well, the boss
isn't always right

531
00:35:09,876 --> 00:35:11,311
but he's always the boss.

532
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:17,316
Do you never worry?

533
00:35:18,418 --> 00:35:20,287
Would it help?

534
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:28,427
All rise.

535
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:35,035
"I pledge allegiance
to the Flag

536
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:38,138
"of the United States
of America,

537
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:42,142
"and to the Republic
for which it stands,

538
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:47,047
"one Nation under God,
indivisible,

539
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,349
"with liberty and justice
for all."

540
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:55,188
<i>First,
you have to know what happens</i>

541
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:57,257
<i>when an atomic bomb explodes.</i>

542
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,096
<i>There is a bright flash,
brighter than the sun.</i>

543
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,266
<i>It can smash in buildings,
break windows all over town.</i>

544
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:12,339
<i>But if you duck and cover
like Bert,</i>

545
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,307
<i>you will be much safer.</i>

546
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,443
<i>There are
two kinds of attack,</i>

547
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:18,912
<i>with warning
and without any warning.</i>

548
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:22,281
Mmm.

549
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:25,218
What's going on in here?

550
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:27,120
Okay, Dad,
this is really important.

551
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:29,189
When the war begins,
the first thing they do

552
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:31,925
is cut off all the water
and all the electricity.

553
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:34,060
So the first thing we should do
is keep this filled,

554
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:35,428
use the shower in your room,

555
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:37,964
use the sink downstairs,
the garden hose outside...

556
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:40,066
Those are good ideas.

557
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,068
But, Roger, I don't see this

558
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:43,982
as being something
you ever have to worry about.

559
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,673
Yeah, but when
you hear the sirens,

560
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,910
there may not be enough time
to fill the tub and the sinks.

561
00:36:50,944 --> 00:36:52,379
Not gonna be any sirens...

562
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:55,348
What is this?

563
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,416
When the bomb comes,

564
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:59,286
the Reds will aim
for the Empire State Building.

565
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,122
But the bomb goes off
at 10,000 feet up.

566
00:37:02,155 --> 00:37:04,090
In <i>Life</i> magazine,
it's called an airburst,

567
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:06,126
and if the bomb
is 50 megatons,

568
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,329
the blast wave goes
out and out and out

569
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:11,898
and melts everything
from here to here.

570
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:13,166
Including where we live.
Here.

571
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,102
Yeah, right there.

572
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:17,237
But, you know, Roger,

573
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,906
no one is dropping
atomic bombs on us.

574
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,308
But the Russians want to.

575
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:23,243
You know that Russian guy
you're defending?

576
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:24,344
He's here
to get things ready

577
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:26,179
for the guys
who drop the bombs.

578
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:28,281
No, no, he's not...
Not here for that.

579
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:29,916
He's not even Russian.

580
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,985
He was born, we think,
in Northern England.

581
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:33,258
Yeah, but he's
a spy for Russia.

582
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,523
I don't even understand
what you're doing.

583
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:38,992
You're not a Communist,
so why are you defending one?

584
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:40,994
Well, because it's my job.

585
00:37:41,027 --> 00:37:43,063
It never used to be.

586
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:15,028
<i>- In the case of the
- United States of America</i>

587
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:17,264
versus Rudolf Abel,

588
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,966
as to the first count
in the indictment,

589
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,068
how do you
find the defendant?

590
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:24,337
Guilty or not guilty?

591
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:25,371
Guilty.

592
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:28,241
As to the second count?

593
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:30,477
Guilty.

594
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,579
As to the third count?

595
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:33,847
Guilty.

596
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,249
Your Honor, I make a motion
to set aside these guilty verdicts

597
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:38,018
against the weight
of evidence.

598
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:39,552
Denied.

599
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,454
The jury is discharged.

600
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,523
Thank you all.

601
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:45,458
I would like to add that,
if I were one of you,

602
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,394
I would've reached
the same verdict.

603
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,564
Sentencing will be

604
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,035
<i>November 15.</i>

605
00:39:03,543 --> 00:39:06,112
The death sentence is not
a foregone conclusion.

606
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:07,147
Don't worry.

607
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:10,450
I'm not afraid to die,
Mr. Donovan.

608
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,322
Although

609
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,257
it wouldn't be
my first choice.

610
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,596
You left this behind.

611
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:26,266
Oh, thank you.

612
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:30,503
Oh, thank you very much!

613
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:53,293
You've never asked me
if the charges were true.

614
00:39:56,096 --> 00:39:59,032
If I am indeed a spy.

615
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,669
This is how we do it.

616
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:05,071
The case against you matters.

617
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:06,473
Making them prove it matters.

618
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:08,408
The fiction is...

619
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,410
Whether you did it or not
doesn't matter.

620
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:13,413
The state has to prove it,
that you're a spy.

621
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:15,148
So you're not curious?

622
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,150
No, not really.

623
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:19,686
I always assumed
you were an artist.

624
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,654
My wife, she's the artist.

625
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:24,290
She's a musician

626
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:28,128
in the Children's Orchestra
of Moscow.

627
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:29,496
What instrument?

628
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:31,398
The harp.

629
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,431
Oh.

630
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:35,168
Then, she's an angel.

631
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:48,214
Standing there like that,
you remind me of a man

632
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:50,483
who used to come
to our house when I was young.

633
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:55,255
My father used to say,
"Watch this man."

634
00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:59,692
So I did,
every time he came.

635
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:02,695
And never once

636
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:05,565
did he do
anything remarkable.

637
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:10,136
And I remind you of him?

638
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:17,377
This one time, I was
about the age of your son.

639
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,513
Our house was overrun
by partisan border guards.

640
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:26,619
Dozens of them.

641
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,688
My father was beaten,
my mother was beaten,

642
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:32,125
and this man,
my father's friend, he was beaten.

643
00:41:33,793 --> 00:41:35,728
And I watched this man.

644
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:40,600
Every time they hit him

645
00:41:42,735 --> 00:41:44,437
he stood back up again.

646
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,208
So they hit him harder.

647
00:41:50,477 --> 00:41:52,545
Still,
he got back to his feet.

648
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:58,485
I think because of this
they stopped the beating.

649
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:00,220
They let him live.

650
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:10,463
I remember them saying it.

651
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:20,373
It sort of means, like, uh,

652
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,177
"standing man."

653
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:28,814
Standing man.

654
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:43,296
Hello, Jim!
Millie, you're a vision.

655
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:45,698
Mortie's busy
getting kitted out.

656
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,233
But come on in.

657
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:51,404
Scotch, Jim?
Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

658
00:42:51,437 --> 00:42:53,273
Uh, just a drop of water.

659
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:55,542
Your Honor.

660
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:58,444
Hello, Jim!
Just going out.

661
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:00,446
Got a few minutes though.

662
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,449
March of Dimes thing.
Millie is active.

663
00:43:04,884 --> 00:43:06,653
Well, thank you
for seeing me.

664
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:10,723
I just wanted to give you
my two cents on the sentencing.

665
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,860
And I thought maybe
I should pester you at home

666
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:16,863
as not all of my points
are narrowly legal.

667
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:19,666
Yeah, well,
it's that kind of case.

668
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,734
I hope I wasn't too scratchy
during the trial

669
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:24,604
but it's exactly
what you say.

670
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:26,573
Nothing about this
is narrowly legal.

671
00:43:28,374 --> 00:43:29,509
There are bigger issues.

672
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,579
Bigger issues!

673
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:36,683
Thank you, thank you.

674
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:37,717
Uh...

675
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,487
Sir...

676
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:43,523
I think it could be
considered

677
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:46,326
in the best interests
of the United States

678
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:49,295
that Abel remain alive.

679
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:51,598
Why?

680
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:53,366
I'm not saying
I've made up my mind

681
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:54,534
but if he was
gonna cooperate,

682
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,736
work with the government,
he would've done it already.

683
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:57,870
- True, but the issue here...
- You can't...

684
00:43:57,904 --> 00:43:59,606
Excuse me.

685
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,513
You can't say it's in the best interest
of the United States

686
00:44:07,547 --> 00:44:11,517
that he spend
the rest of his days in a prison cell.

687
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:13,620
How is this
the national interest?

688
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:15,788
Not the incarceration
itself, sir.

689
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:20,526
It is possible that,
in the foreseeable future,

690
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,795
an American
of equivalent rank

691
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:25,565
might be captured
by Soviet Russia.

692
00:44:25,598 --> 00:44:27,834
We might want to have
someone to trade.

693
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:29,535
Wow.

694
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,738
That sounds like
spinning what-ifs.

695
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:33,673
You could do that
till the cows come home.

696
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:36,643
It's my business, what-ifs.
I'm in insurance.

697
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:38,945
And there's nothing
implausible about this one.

698
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:42,382
It's entirely in the realm
of what could happen.

699
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:45,785
It's the kind of probability that
people buy insurance for.

700
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:49,756
If we send this guy to his death,
we leave ourselves wide open.

701
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:52,558
No policy
in our back pocket

702
00:44:52,592 --> 00:44:54,394
for the day the storm comes.

703
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:58,831
Nice speech.

704
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:04,504
Sir, there is also
the humanitarian argument.

705
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:07,607
Should he die for doing the job
they sent him to do?

706
00:45:09,742 --> 00:45:10,877
All right, Counselor.

707
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:14,647
I gotta run.

708
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:19,752
Good seeing you, Jim.

709
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:25,425
I'll walk you out.

710
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:29,895
All rise.

711
00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:32,932
The United States
District Court

712
00:45:32,965 --> 00:45:35,635
for the Eastern District
of New York is now in session.

713
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:37,737
The honorable
Mortimer Byers presiding.

714
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:43,776
Be seated.

715
00:45:55,688 --> 00:45:57,490
The defendant
will please rise.

716
00:46:12,038 --> 00:46:13,773
In the measured judgment
of this court

717
00:46:13,806 --> 00:46:15,041
the following sentence,

718
00:46:15,074 --> 00:46:17,577
based upon the jury's
verdict of guilty

719
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,912
as to each count
of the indictment,

720
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:24,751
is believed to meet the test
which has been stated.

721
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:27,687
Pursuant to the verdict
of guilty as to all counts,

722
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:31,924
the defendant is committed
to the custody

723
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,026
of the Attorney General
of the United States

724
00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:38,564
for imprisonment
in a federal institution

725
00:46:38,598 --> 00:46:42,034
to be selected by him
for a period of 30 years.

726
00:46:43,169 --> 00:46:45,538
Marshals, you may take
the defendant into custody.

727
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:46,672
No... No electrocution?

728
00:46:46,706 --> 00:46:48,074
No. No, no.

729
00:46:48,107 --> 00:46:49,842
Why aren't we hanging him?

730
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:51,077
In the name of God,
why aren't we hanging him?

731
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:53,012
Sit down, sir!

732
00:46:53,045 --> 00:46:56,749
He's a spy!
He's killing us with his lies!

733
00:46:56,783 --> 00:46:58,518
In the name of God,
why aren't we hanging him?

734
00:46:58,551 --> 00:46:59,552
That's right!

735
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,855
He's a spy!

736
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:08,961
Mr. Donovan! Mr. Donovan!

737
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:11,964
Just one question.
Just one question, sir.

738
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:20,773
My hat! My hat! My hat!

739
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:24,544
Nobody here has a comment.

740
00:47:24,577 --> 00:47:26,112
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan
are not answering questions.

741
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:27,547
How do you feel now that

742
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,748
this national nightmare
is over?

743
00:47:28,781 --> 00:47:30,082
Mr. Donovan, are
you happy with the verdict?

744
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:33,719
We're... We're in
firm ground on, uh, for a case on appeal.

745
00:47:33,753 --> 00:47:34,993
Appeal?
Appeal, yes.

746
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:51,003
Jim, you did a great job.

747
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:53,806
You fulfilled your mandate
and then some.

748
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,842
But the man is a spy.

749
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,578
The verdict is correct
and there's no reason to appeal it.

750
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:00,546
There's ample
procedural reason.

751
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,647
We know the search
is tainted.

752
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:02,849
And Fourth Amendment issues

753
00:48:02,882 --> 00:48:04,884
will always weigh more heavily
in an appellate forum.

754
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:06,619
We've got a good shot.

755
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:09,622
What the goddamn hell
are you talking about?

756
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:12,859
We were supposed to show
he had a capable defense, which we did.

757
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:15,161
Why are you citing
the goddamn Constitution at me?

758
00:48:15,194 --> 00:48:16,896
Tom, if you
look me in the eye

759
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,965
and tell me
we don't have grounds

760
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:19,999
for an appeal,
I'll drop it right now.

761
00:48:20,032 --> 00:48:22,168
I'm not saying that.
You know what I'm saying.

762
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:24,637
Tom is saying there's
a cost to these things.

763
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,172
That's right.

764
00:48:26,205 --> 00:48:28,841
A cost to both
your family and your firm.

765
00:49:03,843 --> 00:49:06,679
I've missed music.

766
00:49:06,712 --> 00:49:09,048
They checked the radio to make
sure there was no transmitter in it.

767
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:10,950
I'm sure they did.

768
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,987
Shostakovich. Mmm.

769
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:19,692
That's a very great artist,
Shostakovich.

770
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:36,742
Uh, I think

771
00:49:38,144 --> 00:49:42,114
our strongest grounds
for reversal

772
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:43,148
are constitutional.

773
00:49:46,285 --> 00:49:50,022
Our best chance is if the Supreme Court
agrees to review our case.

774
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:56,896
Jim...

775
00:50:03,803 --> 00:50:04,937
You should be careful.

776
00:50:10,776 --> 00:50:11,911
Careful.

They're cowards.
They're gone.

799
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:12,238
We have detectives
canvassing the neighborhood.

800
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:14,173
Maybe we'll find
a description of the car

801
00:51:14,206 --> 00:51:15,975
but I don't think
it's very likely.

802
00:51:16,008 --> 00:51:17,910
We're gonna
need protection.

803
00:51:17,943 --> 00:51:20,312
Oh, I have instructions
to leave two cars here.

804
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:21,213
It'll be pretty obvious

805
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:22,248
that this is a secure...
For how long?

806
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:24,784
I have to be in Washington
later on this week.

807
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:26,185
What are you doing?

808
00:51:26,218 --> 00:51:27,353
What are you doing
to your family?

809
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:29,055
Pardon me, Officer?

810
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:30,222
You're still
defending this guy?

811
00:51:30,256 --> 00:51:30,990
I mean, what are you
fighting for him for?

812
00:51:31,023 --> 00:51:33,092
Okay, knock that off,
Officer.

813
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:34,360
I'll knock off nothing.

814
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:36,028
I was in the third wave
at Omaha Beach.

815
00:51:36,062 --> 00:51:37,163
Hey, I did my time
in the service.

816
00:51:37,196 --> 00:51:39,098
I was fighting these guys,
and you're defending them?

817
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:41,834
Why don't you just
do your job as an officer of the law?

818
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:43,369
Okay, I'm sorry.
Let's go outside. Come on.

819
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:44,937
You know what?
Just forget him.

820
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,238
What am I not getting here?

821
00:51:46,272 --> 00:51:50,242
Outside, Officer. I'm sorry.

822
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:53,079
Defending a commie spy. Jeez!

823
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:12,932
Do you feel
that you deserve this, sir?

824
00:52:35,187 --> 00:52:36,355
Should it become necessary

825
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:39,425
to abandon the aircraft
over Soviet territory,

826
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:42,027
then there's a two-and-a-half pound
explosive charge

827
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:44,296
contained within
the fuselage.

828
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,299
Now, first,
you activate the circuits.

829
00:52:49,368 --> 00:52:52,238
But to start
the 70-second timer,

830
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:55,174
you need to flip the switch
marked "Destruct."

831
00:52:58,144 --> 00:53:02,281
It is imperative that these
flights remain a secret

832
00:53:02,314 --> 00:53:05,851
and this equipment
does not fall into enemy hands.

833
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:08,020
What about us?

834
00:53:08,053 --> 00:53:10,222
I don't know if you're kidding,
Lieutenant Powers.

835
00:53:10,256 --> 00:53:11,924
I'm not.

836
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,461
What you know
about the plane

837
00:53:15,494 --> 00:53:17,863
is as secret
as the plane itself.

838
00:53:20,032 --> 00:53:23,202
If capture
is a foregone conclusion,

839
00:53:23,235 --> 00:53:25,271
you go down with your plane.

840
00:53:25,304 --> 00:53:28,207
Now, if you think
you can ditch and get away,

841
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,909
if you're close enough
to a border, fine.

842
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:31,177
You know
the ejection protocol.

843
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:36,348
But if you ditch,

844
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:38,484
you bring the dollar with you.

845
00:53:38,517 --> 00:53:41,053
All right,
there's a pin inside.

846
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:46,225
You scratch your skin
anywhere, it's instantaneous.

847
00:53:46,258 --> 00:53:49,228
If you think you are
about to be captured,

848
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:50,429
you use it.

849
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,335
Drivers, you understand me?

850
00:53:58,204 --> 00:53:59,872
Spend the dollar.

851
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,129
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

852
00:54:57,162 --> 00:55:00,499
The "Cold War" is not
just a phrase, Your Honor.

853
00:55:00,532 --> 00:55:03,168
It's not just
a figure of speech.

854
00:55:03,202 --> 00:55:05,337
Truly,
a battle is being fought

855
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:09,174
between two competing views
of the world.

856
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:12,444
I contend
that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel,

857
00:55:12,478 --> 00:55:14,580
"Colonel Abel,"
as he was called

858
00:55:14,613 --> 00:55:17,049
even by the men
who arrested him,

859
00:55:17,082 --> 00:55:20,219
is our foe in that battle.

860
00:55:20,252 --> 00:55:21,987
Auxiliary power?

861
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:23,589
Connected and on.

862
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:26,058
Oxygen seat-pack supply?

863
00:55:26,091 --> 00:55:27,526
Supply at 1,800 psi.

864
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,228
Inverter?

865
00:55:29,261 --> 00:55:30,396
On, light out.

866
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:33,599
He was treated
as a combatant in that war

867
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:37,603
until it no longer
suited our government to so treat him.

868
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:40,005
Accordingly,

869
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:43,475
he was not given the protections
we give our own citizens.

870
00:55:43,509 --> 00:55:45,244
He was subjected
to treatment that,

871
00:55:45,277 --> 00:55:48,047
however appropriate
for a suspected enemy,

872
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,549
was not appropriate
to a suspected criminal.

873
00:55:50,582 --> 00:55:52,017
Fuel transfer?

874
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:53,118
Transfer switch off.

875
00:55:53,152 --> 00:55:54,253
Destructor?

876
00:55:54,286 --> 00:55:55,421
Destructor safety.

877
00:55:55,454 --> 00:55:56,622
Climb data card.

878
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:58,190
Installed in aircraft.

879
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:14,340
I know this man.

880
00:56:14,373 --> 00:56:18,177
If the charge is true, he serves a
foreign power but he serves it faithfully.

881
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:22,147
If he is a soldier in the opposing army,
he is a good soldier.

882
00:56:22,181 --> 00:56:25,117
He has not fled the field
of battle to save himself.

883
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,319
He has refused
to serve his captor.

884
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:29,655
He has refused
to betray his cause.

885
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:32,257
He has refused
to take the coward's way out.

886
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:35,127
The coward
must abandon his dignity

887
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,662
before he abandons
the field of battle.

888
00:56:36,695 --> 00:56:40,132
That,
Rudolf Abel will never do.

889
00:56:40,165 --> 00:56:41,266
Shouldn't we,

890
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,469
by giving him
the full benefit

891
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:46,105
of the rights that define
our system of government,

892
00:56:46,138 --> 00:56:48,540
show this man who we are?

893
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:51,377
Who we are.

894
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:55,681
Is that not the greatest weapon
we have in this Cold War?

895
00:56:55,714 --> 00:56:58,684
Will we stand by our cause
less resolutely

896
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:00,652
than he stands by his?

897
00:59:44,683 --> 00:59:46,418
<i>The President announced</i>

898
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:50,389

I'll be damned if I can find the file

921
01:00:44,643 --> 01:00:47,913
I, uh, Mr. Watters had me
move it over to Jack Elwes's office

922
01:00:47,946 --> 01:00:49,848
along with the first draft
of the appeal.

923
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:51,383
He did?

924
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:54,586
Yeah, he redrafted and filed that last week

Someplace fancy.

I'm betting Mr. Young
would like some of the finer things

929
01:01:06,665 --> 01:01:08,400
New York has to offer.

930
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:10,402
And I want you to give me
the summary of...

931
01:01:28,687 --> 01:01:30,722
Do you know anyone
from Leipzig?

932
01:01:30,756 --> 01:01:35,427
"Leipzig." Am I getting
hate mail from Germany now?

933
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,595
From East Germany.

934
01:01:45,637 --> 01:01:47,606
Is it your wife?

935
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:48,640
No.

936
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,910
No, no, no, no.

937
01:01:51,943 --> 01:01:55,647
She pretends to be
but it's not even a good pretense.

938
01:01:56,882 --> 01:01:59,618
"I'm taking this liberty
to write to you

939
01:01:59,651 --> 01:02:01,887

942
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:12,564
And do I write back?

943
01:02:15,434 --> 01:02:16,702
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

944
01:02:20,472 --> 01:02:23,842
What's the next move
when you don't know what the game is?

945
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:27,713
<i>Francis Gary Powers...</i>

946
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:34,419
On the strength of Article Two
of the U.S.S.R. law

947
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:38,023
on criminal responsibility
for state crimes

948
01:02:38,056 --> 01:02:40,559
to 10 years of confinement

949
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:42,961
with the first three years
to be served in prison.

950
01:02:45,564 --> 01:02:47,032
The term of the punishment,

951
01:02:47,065 --> 01:02:49,935
including
preliminary detention,

952
01:02:49,968 --> 01:02:52,637
shall be counted
from May first,

953
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,806
nineteen hundred and sixty.

954
01:03:20,632 --> 01:03:22,968
<i>Mr. Donovan,
thank you so much for coming.</i>

955
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:25,470
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Dulles.

956
01:03:25,504 --> 01:03:26,671
It's an honor, sir.

957
01:03:27,973 --> 01:03:32,077
Nescafe, cream, two lumps.

958
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,579
Thank you.

959
01:03:34,613 --> 01:03:36,782
Okay,
this letter you received.

960
01:03:36,815 --> 01:03:39,518
Seems pretty clear that the Soviets
are making an overture here.

961
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:42,187
They're doing it
through East Germany

962
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,589
because they still don't want
to acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen,

963
01:03:44,623 --> 01:03:46,758
much less a Soviet spy. So...

964
01:03:48,093 --> 01:03:49,795
Lot of fiction going on.

965
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:52,063
Yes, sir, but to what end?

966
01:03:52,097 --> 01:03:54,533
They got our guy,
our spy pilot.

967
01:03:54,566 --> 01:03:55,767
We've got their guy.

968
01:03:58,737 --> 01:04:02,007
Prisoner exchange,
I think that's what they're after.

969
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,676
Which could hardly be
a surprise to you, Counselor.

970
01:04:04,709 --> 01:04:07,646
It's an eventuality
that I think you foresaw.

971
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,849
Yes, I sure did,
and I'm so rarely right.

972
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:13,985
Well, congratulations.
Red letter day.

973
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:18,089
Now, we have our man
over there. Powers.

974
01:04:18,123 --> 01:04:22,060
Good man, but with
a head full of classified information.

975
01:04:22,093 --> 01:04:24,729
Abel has a head
full of classified information, too,

976
01:04:24,763 --> 01:04:26,731
but he hasn't
given us a lick.

977
01:04:26,765 --> 01:04:28,567
And, sir, take it from me,
he won't.

978
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,969
Yes, we know that,
but the Russians don't.

979
01:04:31,002 --> 01:04:33,872
They want their man back
before he cracks.

980
01:04:33,905 --> 01:04:36,842
And we want Powers back
for the same reasons.

981
01:04:40,178 --> 01:04:42,547
I think
you are saying, sir,

982
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:45,016
that there might be
a happy ending for everyone.

983
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,019
Yes, if we, um,
indulge their fiction.

984
01:04:56,194 --> 01:04:58,630
We want you
to negotiate the swap

985
01:04:58,663 --> 01:04:59,831
because you're
a private citizen,

986
01:04:59,865 --> 01:05:02,033
so it's not
governments talking.

987
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:04,769
They don't acknowledge
Abel as a Soviet citizen,

988
01:05:04,803 --> 01:05:08,573
and we don't acknowledge East Germany
as a sovereign country.

989
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,875
We haven't
recognized East Berlin

990
01:05:09,908 --> 01:05:12,644
since it was annexed
by the Soviets in '45.

991
01:05:12,677 --> 01:05:15,881
So I act as a negotiator,
representing...

992
01:05:15,914 --> 01:05:17,749
You're not
representing anybody.

993
01:05:17,782 --> 01:05:18,822
Not a government official.

994
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,019
You have no
official standing.

995
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:23,054
So, some fiction
on our side as well.

996
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:24,389
Correct.

997
01:05:24,422 --> 01:05:27,792
Which means, of course,
you can't rely on any acknowledgment

998
01:05:27,826 --> 01:05:30,595
or help if things go south.

999
01:05:30,629 --> 01:05:32,697
CIA can't be responsible.

1000
01:05:32,731 --> 01:05:34,032
We can't be embarrassed.

1001
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,104
Where do they want this
negotiation to take place?

1002
01:05:39,137 --> 01:05:40,705
There.

1003
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:41,940
"There"?

1004
01:05:41,973 --> 01:05:43,141
East Berlin.

1005
01:05:45,744 --> 01:05:47,913
Well, isn't East Berlin
getting rather...

1006
01:05:47,946 --> 01:05:50,148
Oh, yes, the place
is getting complicated.

1007
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,184
Yeah, complicated.

1008
01:05:56,154 --> 01:05:59,658
The Soviet side has been setting up
checkpoints for the past few months

1009
01:05:59,691 --> 01:06:01,993
to try to stop people
hemorrhaging to the Western sectors,

1010
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:03,862
and it hasn't worked.

1011
01:06:03,895 --> 01:06:05,697
We have intelligence
to suggest

1012
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:07,866
that they may go
one step further

1013
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:10,001
and wall off
the entire Eastern sector.

1014
01:06:15,874 --> 01:06:18,109
Okay, that's it
in a nutshell.

1015
01:06:18,143 --> 01:06:20,812
The decision
is entirely yours.

1016
01:06:20,845 --> 01:06:23,915
You need time
to kick it around.

1017
01:06:29,888 --> 01:06:32,123
No.

1018
01:06:32,157 --> 01:06:33,258
No, I don't.

1019
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:36,194
Well, fine. Fine.

1020
01:06:36,227 --> 01:06:38,797
Best that this all
remains confidential.

1021
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:43,902
Let's not discuss any of this with, uh,
Mary or with anyone else.

1022
01:06:43,935 --> 01:06:46,071
Share the correspondence
only with us.

1023
01:06:46,104 --> 01:06:47,939
Let us know what they want to do
and when.

1024
01:06:47,973 --> 01:06:50,909
I've got no client,
no wife, no country.

1025
01:06:50,942 --> 01:06:54,012
Don't know what I'm doing
or when or who for.

1026
01:06:54,045 --> 01:06:55,780
You're doing it
for your country,

1027
01:06:55,814 --> 01:06:57,816
but your country
doesn't know that yet.

1028
01:06:57,849 --> 01:07:00,952
What about my client,
the other person in this equation? My guy?

1029
01:07:00,986 --> 01:07:02,854
Your guy?
You mean the Russian?

1030
01:07:02,887 --> 01:07:04,756
He's not your guy anymore,
Counselor.

1031
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:07,826
Your guy is
Francis Gary Powers now.

1032
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:10,729
What do I tell
Rudolf Abel?

1033
01:07:10,762 --> 01:07:12,130
Tell him not to drop dead.

1034
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,177
Professor?

1035
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:13,084
Professor?

1036
01:09:14,085 --> 01:09:16,054
Papa went to university.

1037
01:09:16,087 --> 01:09:18,256
You shouldn't be here,
Frederic.

1038
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:20,158
They're having
classes today?

1039
01:09:20,191 --> 01:09:22,427
He went to see.
That's where he goes.

1040
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,028
What are you doing here?

1041
01:09:24,062 --> 01:09:26,064
I came to get you
and your father.

1042
01:09:26,097 --> 01:09:28,099
You have to come with me.
You might not get out tomorrow.

1043
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:29,334
Just... Just leave?

1044
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:31,803
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, leave.
Right now.

1045
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:05,336
Go back. Go back.

1046
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:07,906
I'll be okay, I'm American.
Go back.

1047
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:10,175
Go back to your father's.
We'll find another way. Go.

1048
01:10:16,014 --> 01:10:17,015
Hey!

1049
01:10:17,382 --> 01:10:18,983
So, hi.

1050
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:24,088
Papers, please.

1051
01:10:24,122 --> 01:10:26,224
<i>Ich bin Student</i>

1052
01:10:26,257 --> 01:10:28,426
Yes,

01:10:39,404 --> 01:10:41,940
My name's Frederic Pryor.
I'm an economics student.

1054
01:10:44,042 --> 01:10:48,112
See?
It's my dissertation.
My thesis.

1055
01:10:50,215 --> 01:10:51,683
You see? Look, look.

1056
01:10:51,716 --> 01:10:55,320
Look "The foreign trade system
of the European Communist nations." Huh?

1057
01:11:00,491 --> 01:11:02,260
It was a lot of work.

1058
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:12,136
No, that's my only copy.

1059
01:11:13,504 --> 01:11:15,173
No!

1060
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:18,977
<i>Tell me something.</i>

1061
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:21,079
It came up
at the last minute.

1062
01:11:21,112 --> 01:11:23,414
They have offices
in London.

1063
01:11:23,448 --> 01:11:26,417
These clients.
Not my idea.

1064
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:29,087
Scotland, this
fishing expedition.

1065
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,322
What kind of
fishing trip, Jim?

1066
01:11:31,356 --> 01:11:34,092
Salmon fishing.

1067
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,165
Just tell me that you're
not gonna be in any danger,

1068
01:11:36,194 --> 01:11:37,528
that this is
just a routine business trip,

1069
01:11:37,562 --> 01:11:39,264
and I won't worry.

1070
01:11:39,998 --> 01:11:41,266
I need my passport.

1071
01:11:46,404 --> 01:11:48,072
Just give me something
to hold on to.

1072
01:11:48,106 --> 01:11:49,507
I don't even care
if it's the truth.

1073
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:53,211
I'm doing this for us.

1074
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:18,603
Mr. Michener, here,
is your Berlin escort.

1075
01:12:18,636 --> 01:12:21,439
He's an attache
with the U.S. embassy.

1076
01:12:21,472 --> 01:12:24,075
- So, it's gotten goddamn complicated.
Uh-huh.

1077
01:12:24,108 --> 01:12:25,476
As you know,
the last letter from Mrs. Abel,

1078
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,612
whoever she is, talks about
a lawyer in East Berlin,

1079
01:12:27,645 --> 01:12:30,114
Mr. Vogel, whoever he is,
representing her interests, she says.

1080
01:12:30,148 --> 01:12:31,516
Yeah, Vogel says

1081
01:12:31,549 --> 01:12:33,451
he's gone to the Russian
embassy in East Berlin

1082
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:36,120
and they may be ready
to trade Abel for Powers.

1083
01:12:36,154 --> 01:12:38,056
But no one knows who's who,

1084
01:12:38,089 --> 01:12:39,324
but essentially they're all Russian,
right?

1085
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:42,160
Well, Soviet.
Well, we think so.

1086
01:12:42,193 --> 01:12:44,362
What do you mean?
Could we turn up the heat in here?

1087
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,599
There's a wrinkle.

1088
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:51,069
They might try
to throw you a curveball.

1089
01:12:51,102 --> 01:12:54,072
Try and get you to accept
another prisoner other than Powers.

1090
01:12:54,105 --> 01:12:55,440
Another American?

1091
01:12:55,473 --> 01:12:58,609
The, uh, East German Stasi
picked up an American student.

1092
01:12:58,643 --> 01:12:59,844
Frederic Pryor.

1093
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:02,447
Uh, the kid they found on the wrong
side of the Wall.

1094
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,248
He's a grad student
out of Yale.

1095
01:13:04,282 --> 01:13:06,317
- Came over here to study economics.
Mmm-hmm.

1096
01:13:06,351 --> 01:13:10,188
So, they're making noises
about trying this kid for espionage.

1097
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:12,657
Grave offense, capital crime.
Well.

1098
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:17,428
Vogel got in touch with us,
said he represents Pryor.

1099
01:13:17,462 --> 01:13:22,400
Wait a minute. Vogel represents Mrs. Abel
and this... This kid?

1100
01:13:22,433 --> 01:13:24,102
Yeah, he's busy.

1101
01:13:25,236 --> 01:13:26,304
Well, so,
what is he?

1102
01:13:26,337 --> 01:13:28,673
Vogel, is he, uh,
East German or is he Russian?

1103
01:13:28,706 --> 01:13:31,376
Well, try to figure it out
when you meet him.

1104
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:33,678
At Russian embassy,
East Berlin, noon tomorrow.

1105
01:13:33,711 --> 01:13:36,414
Hoffman will show you
how to get there.

1106
01:13:36,447 --> 01:13:38,516
Wait, show me how to get there?
I'm gonna have an escort.

1107
01:13:38,549 --> 01:13:40,385
Right?

1108
01:13:40,418 --> 01:13:42,520
Well, that was the plan
but like I said, there's a wrinkle.

1109
01:13:42,553 --> 01:13:45,289
I won't be taking you.
Decision's been made.

1110
01:13:45,323 --> 01:13:48,092
No U.S. government personnel are to
cross the border until further notice.

1111
01:13:48,126 --> 01:13:49,427
How come?
It's too dangerous.

1112
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,295
Yeah, the East Germans
grabbed this kid.

1113
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:55,266
There's a degree of impunity
that we had not anticipated.

1114
01:13:55,299 --> 01:13:58,269
The point is that the East German agenda
and the Russian agenda

1115
01:13:58,302 --> 01:13:59,704
may not be
the same thing.

1116
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:01,606
Try and figure it out
and act accordingly.

1117
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:03,441
And try to make a deal.
Powers for Abel.

1118
01:14:03,474 --> 01:14:06,377
Well, what about this
college kid, Pryor?

1119
01:14:06,411 --> 01:14:09,213
Mmm-mmm.
Don't fall for that.

1120
01:14:09,247 --> 01:14:10,314
We can get him out
another time.

1121
01:14:10,348 --> 01:14:11,549
Powers is the whole
ball game.

1122
01:14:34,605 --> 01:14:36,307
Where's your room?

1123
01:14:37,308 --> 01:14:38,468
I'll be staying
at the Hilton.

1124
01:14:40,711 --> 01:14:41,711
It's not far.

1125
01:14:43,781 --> 01:14:46,350
This is a number here
in West Berlin.

1126
01:14:46,384 --> 01:14:47,744
Memorize it and
give it back to me.

1127
01:14:49,387 --> 01:14:50,621
No, no. I...
I mean, now.

1128
01:14:53,357 --> 01:14:55,359
The Soviets keep cutting
the international lines

1129
01:14:55,393 --> 01:14:57,628
but local calls
are okay.

1130
01:14:57,662 --> 01:14:59,497
Someone will pick up
day and night.

1131
01:15:08,339 --> 01:15:11,676
Now, this docket attached to your passport
will serve as your ticket

1132
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:13,611
into and out of
the Eastern Soviet sector.

1133
01:15:15,713 --> 01:15:17,593
The meeting with Vogel
is set for noon tomorrow.

1134
01:15:24,355 --> 01:15:26,257
There are only a few routes
left to the East.

1135
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:28,493
You take the S-Bahn, the station we showed
you on the way in.

1136
01:15:28,526 --> 01:15:30,795
You're gonna get off
at the Friedrichstrasse station here

1137
01:15:30,828 --> 01:15:33,731
and walk to the Soviet embassy
on Unter den Linden here.

1138
01:15:33,764 --> 01:15:36,400
Look at the map now.
You shouldn't take it with you.

1139
01:15:36,434 --> 01:15:38,536
You're looking at a map,
you're an American, you're a spy.

1140
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:40,571
You could
well be detained.

1141
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:42,673
Just avoid interacting
with people generally.

1142
01:15:42,707 --> 01:15:45,643
You don't...
You don't belong, so don't stick out.

1143
01:15:45,676 --> 01:15:47,778
Food is scarce over there
and things have started to fall apart.

1144
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:49,013
There are gangs,

1145
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:52,316
and rule of law is less firmly
established over there.

1146
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,352
And definitely stay away
from the Wall.

1147
01:15:54,385 --> 01:15:55,553
On their side,
there's a line

1148
01:15:55,586 --> 01:15:56,621
cleared of buildings
along the Wall.

1149
01:15:56,654 --> 01:15:58,356
They call it
the "Death Line."

1150
01:15:58,389 --> 01:16:00,291
Cross it and
you'll be shot.

1151
01:16:00,324 --> 01:16:02,660
Is there any outcome here
where I'm not either detained or shot?

1152
01:16:02,693 --> 01:16:05,296
Don't worry too much
about what Michener said.

1153
01:16:05,329 --> 01:16:07,365
No, I'm worried about
what you're saying.

1154
01:16:07,398 --> 01:16:09,400
This kid, Pryor,

1155
01:16:09,433 --> 01:16:10,835
that the East Germans have,
how old is he?

1156
01:16:10,868 --> 01:16:13,271
Twenty-five. Why?

1157
01:16:13,304 --> 01:16:14,472
Same age as Dougie.

1158
01:16:16,807 --> 01:16:18,309
Who?

1159
01:16:18,342 --> 01:16:19,810
Eh, an associate of mine.

1160
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,414
Frederic Pryor.

1161
01:18:00,611 --> 01:18:01,746
Okay, okay, okay.

1162
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:50,695
<i>Danke.</i>

1163
01:19:47,852 --> 01:19:53,624
So, we apologize
if this offends.

1164
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:00,731
Uh...
Coat?

1165
01:20:19,984 --> 01:20:20,985
Okay.

1166
01:21:14,572 --> 01:21:17,608
Do you understand English?
Yes, sir.

1167
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:19,743
I'm James Donovan.
I'm here to meet a Mr. Vogel.

1168
01:21:19,777 --> 01:21:21,879
Mr. Vogel.
He doesn't work here.

1169
01:21:21,912 --> 01:21:23,832
I'm just supposed to meet him.
That's all I know.

1170
01:21:47,204 --> 01:21:48,839
Mr. Donovan!

1171
01:21:49,707 --> 01:21:51,041
So we finally meet you.

1172
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:54,845
I'm Helen Abel.

1173
01:21:54,879 --> 01:21:56,180
How is our husband?
Oh. He's fine.

1174
01:21:56,213 --> 01:21:57,681
How is my Rudolf?

1175
01:21:57,715 --> 01:21:59,650
As good as
can be expected.

1176
01:21:59,683 --> 01:22:02,186
And we will
get him back, yes?

1177
01:22:02,219 --> 01:22:04,655
This is our daughter.
How do you do?

1178
01:22:05,055 --> 01:22:06,055
Lydia.

1179
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:07,892
Are you Mr. Vogel?

1180
01:22:08,826 --> 01:22:10,160
No, no, no!

1181
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:11,929
I'm not Vogel.

1182
01:22:11,962 --> 01:22:13,130
I'm cousin Drews.

1183
01:22:15,065 --> 01:22:16,934
This is Rudolf's
beloved cousin Drews.

1184
01:22:16,967 --> 01:22:19,169
Yes, cousin Drews.
I am cousin Drews.

1185
01:22:19,203 --> 01:22:20,905
Cousin Drews, yes.

1186
01:22:20,938 --> 01:22:21,972
I'm Helen Abel.

1187
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:27,177
When will you see him?

1188
01:22:28,946 --> 01:22:30,948
When will your government
release him?

1189
01:22:30,981 --> 01:22:32,950
I'm a little,
uh, lost here.

1190
01:22:32,983 --> 01:22:34,852
I'm supposed to meet
a Mr. Vogel.

1191
01:22:34,885 --> 01:22:36,987
Oh, Mr. Vogel
is our lawyer.

1192
01:22:37,021 --> 01:22:40,958
We were supposed to negotiate,
uh, the exchange.

1193
01:22:40,991 --> 01:22:43,761
To bring Rudolf here?
Yes, yes, to bring him here.

1194
01:22:43,794 --> 01:22:46,630
But it doesn't happen unilaterally,
do you understand?

1195
01:22:46,664 --> 01:22:48,165
It has to be
an exchange.

1196
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:52,970
Not here?

1197
01:23:00,077 --> 01:23:01,111
Shh.

1198
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,982
Shh. Shh.

1199
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:14,892
Mr. Donovan?

1200
01:23:14,925 --> 01:23:16,060
Mr. Vogel.

1201
01:23:16,093 --> 01:23:17,995
No, no, no.
Goodness.

1202
01:23:18,028 --> 01:23:20,130
My name is Schischkin.
Ivan Schischkin.

1203
01:23:20,164 --> 01:23:22,232
I'm the second secretary
of the Soviet embassy.

1204
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,770
It wouldn't be appropriate
for Mr. Vogel to join us.

1205
01:23:26,804 --> 01:23:28,973
He is a German national.

1206
01:23:29,006 --> 01:23:31,208
So you aren't here to...

1207
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:34,812
To facilitate this meeting.

1208
01:23:34,845 --> 01:23:37,915
Uh, perhaps Mrs. Abel

1209
01:23:37,948 --> 01:23:40,117
would like to compose
herself privately?

1210
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:43,120
And let Mr. Donovan
and myself to talk?

1211
01:23:45,222 --> 01:23:46,223
Thank you.

1212
01:23:56,133 --> 01:23:58,836
So, I'm confused.
Yes.

1213
01:23:58,869 --> 01:24:00,304
Uh, I don't care
who I talk to

1214
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:03,807
if it's about
an exchange of personnel.

1215
01:24:03,841 --> 01:24:05,809
Are you the person
to talk to?

1216
01:24:05,843 --> 01:24:08,779
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Uh, we should talk.

1217
01:24:08,812 --> 01:24:11,048
Please, have a seat,
Mr. Donovan.

1218
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,952
Uh, how did you arrive
to the Eastern sector?

1219
01:24:14,985 --> 01:24:16,053
The train.
The S-Bahn.

1220
01:24:16,086 --> 01:24:17,855
Ah, and you were alone?

1221
01:24:17,888 --> 01:24:19,323
Yeah.

1222
01:24:19,356 --> 01:24:22,726
And you are
credentialed?

1223
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,728
Now, you must know
about me, sir.

1224
01:24:24,762 --> 01:24:26,263
I'm a private citizen.

1225
01:24:26,296 --> 01:24:28,265
I'm a lawyer in Brooklyn
in the United States,

1226
01:24:28,298 --> 01:24:30,934
and I've taken time
out of my busy schedule

1227
01:24:30,968 --> 01:24:33,737
to help my client,
Rudolf Abel.

1228
01:24:33,771 --> 01:24:37,808
I'm authorized to arrange
an exchange of Abel

1229
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:40,277
for Francis Gary Powers.

1230
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:43,180
This is a full
pardon of Abel

1231
01:24:43,213 --> 01:24:45,533
that will be signed
when the exchange actually takes place.

1232
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:48,218
This is the only
reason I'm here.

1233
01:24:48,252 --> 01:24:51,021
I hope and expect to make
this arrangement quickly.

1234
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:54,124
Abel for Francis
Gary Powers

1235
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,795
and Frederic Pryor.

1236
01:25:00,064 --> 01:25:02,066
Mmm, we don't have Pryor.

1237
01:25:02,099 --> 01:25:04,068
No? You don't?

1238
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:09,039
I've heard of Pryor,
but he's held

1239
01:25:09,073 --> 01:25:12,209
by the German
Democratic Republic,

1240
01:25:12,242 --> 01:25:15,079
not by the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1241
01:25:16,013 --> 01:25:18,982
Well, I'll tell you
the first problem.

1242
01:25:19,016 --> 01:25:22,019
The names of your countries
are too long.

1243
01:25:22,052 --> 01:25:25,122
Yes, yes.

1244
01:25:26,223 --> 01:25:28,192
If we release Powers,

1245
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:30,194
it is only to
promote a goodwill

1246
01:25:30,227 --> 01:25:31,361
between our countries.

1247
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:35,766
So, it cannot be
an exchange.

1248
01:25:39,002 --> 01:25:40,204
Perhaps...

1249
01:25:40,237 --> 01:25:43,107
Perhaps you could
release Abel

1250
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,075
as a token of goodwill
to our friends in Germany,

1251
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:47,978
and then,
some months later,

1252
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:50,414
we would release Powers.

1253
01:25:50,447 --> 01:25:52,883
There is an idea.
No. That just won't work for us at all.

1254
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:55,219
See, we need this to be
an exchange.

1255
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:57,020
You can call it
what you want,

1256
01:25:57,054 --> 01:25:58,889
but an exchange
it must be.

1257
01:25:58,922 --> 01:26:02,059
We can have Abel here
within 48 hours.

1258
01:26:02,092 --> 01:26:05,262
We need Powers
at the same time we give you Abel.

1259
01:26:07,464 --> 01:26:10,234
Hmm. This is...

1260
01:26:10,267 --> 01:26:14,171
Can we call this
the "impatient plan"?

1261
01:26:14,204 --> 01:26:16,039
Well, you can call it
whatever you want.

1262
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:21,044
I can relay your
impatient plan to Moscow,

1263
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:21,945
see what they say...

1264
01:26:21,979 --> 01:26:25,315
But they will wonder
why so impatient.

1265
01:26:26,917 --> 01:26:28,318
Because I have a cold.

1266
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,272
And I don't live in Berlin
and I want to go home.

1267
01:26:31,221 --> 01:26:32,322
They will think,

1268
01:26:32,356 --> 01:26:35,192
"Well, the Americans
must have gotten

1269
01:26:35,225 --> 01:26:38,162
"all the information
that Abel had to give.

1270
01:26:38,195 --> 01:26:41,999
"And now they're impatient
to trade him,

1271
01:26:42,032 --> 01:26:45,068
"hoping to get in return
this man, Powers,

1272
01:26:45,102 --> 01:26:47,204
"that, perhaps,
has not yet given up

1273
01:26:47,237 --> 01:26:49,239
"all the information
that he has to give."

1274
01:26:51,108 --> 01:26:53,243
This is not
an equitable trade, sir.

1275
01:26:54,511 --> 01:26:56,146
But what you're saying is,

1276
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:58,182
if Powers has given up
everything he knows,

1277
01:26:58,215 --> 01:27:00,450
then Moscow would trade?

1278
01:27:00,484 --> 01:27:02,052
Why wouldn't they?

1279
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:06,256
As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison,

1280
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,959
the next Russian operative
who gets caught

1281
01:27:08,992 --> 01:27:11,028
might think twice about
keeping his mouth shut.

1282
01:27:11,061 --> 01:27:16,400
And you never know.
Abel might want to see the sky again

1283
01:27:16,433 --> 01:27:19,469
and decide to trade Russian
secrets for small American favors.

1284
01:27:23,307 --> 01:27:25,375
How can we know this?

1285
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:29,079
We little men,
we just do our jobs.

1286
01:27:29,112 --> 01:27:31,448
Like Lieutenant Powers.
He's just a pilot.

1287
01:27:34,284 --> 01:27:38,121
He was making photographs
from 70,000 feet

1288
01:27:38,155 --> 01:27:39,315
when he was shot
from the sky.

1289
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:42,359
People in my country
consider this

1290
01:27:42,392 --> 01:27:44,228
an act of war.

1291
01:27:46,563 --> 01:27:49,333
We have to get off this
merry-go-round, sir.

1292
01:27:49,366 --> 01:27:51,134
The next mistake
our countries make

1293
01:27:51,168 --> 01:27:52,936
could be the last one.

1294
01:27:54,137 --> 01:27:56,406
We need to have
the conversation

1295
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,141
our governments can't.

1296
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:06,116
I will ask Moscow.

1297
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:08,118
Who knows
what they will say.

1298
01:28:10,053 --> 01:28:11,388
There are a lot of people,
Mr. Donovan,

1299
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:15,525
who doesn't want this
exchange to ever take place.

1300
01:28:18,462 --> 01:28:21,999
Can you come back tomorrow
to discuss their answer?

1301
01:28:22,032 --> 01:28:23,033
Powers for Abel.

1302
01:28:23,066 --> 01:28:24,534
And Frederic Pryor.

1303
01:28:24,568 --> 01:28:26,069
As I said,

1304
01:28:26,103 --> 01:28:28,272
Pryor is in the hands
of the organs of

1305
01:28:28,305 --> 01:28:30,507
State Security of the German
Democratic Republic.

1306
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:33,110
I'm confident you can
make arrangements.

1307
01:28:33,143 --> 01:28:35,445
I am merely a secretary

1308
01:28:35,479 --> 01:28:37,180
in the embassy
of foreign power.

1309
01:28:37,214 --> 01:28:38,548
Okay, okay.

1310
01:28:38,582 --> 01:28:42,185
You have to see Mr. Vogel.
I'll give you his address.

1311
01:28:42,219 --> 01:28:44,154
There actually is
a Mr. Vogel?

1312
01:28:44,187 --> 01:28:46,456
Why would you
imagine otherwise?

1313
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:48,392
Uh, it's a short cab ride.

1314
01:28:49,593 --> 01:28:52,429
And please, Mr. Donovan,

1315
01:28:52,462 --> 01:28:54,298
wear an overcoat
in this weather.

1316
01:28:56,099 --> 01:28:57,301
I had mine
stolen from me.

1317
01:28:58,635 --> 01:29:00,304
What do you expect?

1318
01:29:00,337 --> 01:29:02,172
It was from
Saks Fifth Avenue.

1319
01:29:03,507 --> 01:29:04,507
Wasn't it?

1320
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,584
Mr. Donovan.

1321
01:29:14,618 --> 01:29:16,053
Mr. Vogel.

1322
01:29:16,086 --> 01:29:18,055
Please come in.

1323
01:29:18,088 --> 01:29:19,189
<i>Danke.</i>

1324
01:29:22,559 --> 01:29:24,328
Sorry about the embassy.

1325
01:29:26,396 --> 01:29:28,332
But the Soviets decided
not to host me.

1326
01:29:30,133 --> 01:29:32,035
Very irritating.

1327
01:29:32,069 --> 01:29:34,371
I am still trying
to grasp each party's...

1328
01:29:35,339 --> 01:29:37,107
Status?

1329
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:40,243
Yes. And interest
in the proceedings.

1330
01:29:40,277 --> 01:29:41,345
Oh.

1331
01:29:41,378 --> 01:29:43,313
It's a new world.

1332
01:29:43,347 --> 01:29:45,382
All very disorienting,
isn't it?

1333
01:29:55,692 --> 01:29:57,427
Let me tell you
what I have to offer.

1334
01:30:00,297 --> 01:30:02,132
I'm a good friend...

1335
01:30:02,165 --> 01:30:04,201
"Friend."
No, he's older.

1336
01:30:04,234 --> 01:30:06,136
"Protege"?

1337
01:30:06,169 --> 01:30:08,638
Of the attorney general
of the German Democratic Republic.

1338
01:30:08,672 --> 01:30:10,073
Sit down, please.

1339
01:30:13,276 --> 01:30:15,145
This unfortunate,

1340
01:30:15,178 --> 01:30:17,381
Frederic Pryor,

1341
01:30:17,414 --> 01:30:20,317
he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1342
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:23,420
But every accident,
properly viewed,

1343
01:30:23,453 --> 01:30:25,555
is an opportunity,
isn't it, Mr. Donovan?

1344
01:30:25,589 --> 01:30:28,558
Well...
Your country refuses to recognize

1345
01:30:28,592 --> 01:30:31,261
the German
Democratic Republic.

1346
01:30:31,294 --> 01:30:33,296
They prefer to
make up stories

1347
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,930
that the GDR doesn't
exist, for instance.

1348
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:39,336
Sorry.

1349
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:41,705
As a means of forcing your
government's recognition

1350
01:30:41,738 --> 01:30:44,274
of this real place, sir,

1351
01:30:44,307 --> 01:30:46,176
in which you
find yourself,

1352
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:47,677
the GDR,

1353
01:30:47,711 --> 01:30:50,180
the attorney general is
happy to negotiate with you

1354
01:30:50,213 --> 01:30:52,449
as a representative
of your government

1355
01:30:52,482 --> 01:30:53,717
for Mr. Pryor's return.

1356
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,318
Mr. Vogel,
I'm not here

1357
01:30:55,352 --> 01:30:57,387
as a representative
of my government.

1358
01:31:00,457 --> 01:31:01,457
All right.

1359
01:31:04,461 --> 01:31:06,630
I think that's childish,
Mr. Donovan.

1360
01:31:06,663 --> 01:31:09,299
Well, I... I have
no official status.

1361
01:31:09,332 --> 01:31:10,700
Fine.

1362
01:31:10,734 --> 01:31:13,537
You do not represent the USA,
I do not represent the GDR.

1363
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:15,705
My client is Lydia Abel,
Rudolf's wife.

1364
01:31:15,739 --> 01:31:17,340
And I have also...

1365
01:31:17,374 --> 01:31:19,443
Lydia is the daughter.
Helen is the wife.

1366
01:31:25,382 --> 01:31:26,416
Well...

1367
01:31:28,285 --> 01:31:29,686
I am prepared to offer

1368
01:31:29,719 --> 01:31:32,589
Frederic Pryor's exchange
for Rudolf Abel's.

1369
01:31:34,324 --> 01:31:35,625
Then let's be clear.

1370
01:31:35,659 --> 01:31:37,761
We will produce
Rudolf Abel.

1371
01:31:37,794 --> 01:31:41,164
You will produce,
at the same time, the student, Pryor.

1372
01:31:41,698 --> 01:31:43,200
At the same time?

1373
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:44,668
Absolutely.

1374
01:31:44,701 --> 01:31:49,272
The exchange on offer
is a Russian at the end of his life

1375
01:31:51,575 --> 01:31:54,344
for an American student
at the start of his.

1376
01:32:01,284 --> 01:32:04,254
Schischkin? He's not
an embassy secretary.

1377
01:32:04,287 --> 01:32:07,257
Ivan Schischkin is the KGB's
chief in western Europe.

1378
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,592
Well, whatever he is,

1379
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:11,528
he's relaying our
proposal to Moscow

1380
01:32:13,363 --> 01:32:14,531
and they'll decide.

1381
01:32:14,564 --> 01:32:17,334
Could I borrow a coat?
I lost mine.

1382
01:32:17,367 --> 01:32:18,802
How did you
lose your coat?

1383
01:32:18,835 --> 01:32:20,704
You know, spy stuff.

1384
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:26,309
I'll get you another coat.
Good, because...

1385
01:32:26,343 --> 01:32:28,512
So who is, uh...
Who is this Vogel?

1386
01:32:29,412 --> 01:32:31,214
Him, we don't know.

1387
01:32:31,248 --> 01:32:33,517
He might be what you
said he said he is.

1388
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:34,784
Friend of
the attorney general.

1389
01:32:34,818 --> 01:32:38,522
Just some guy the GDR
tapped to handle this.

1390
01:32:38,555 --> 01:32:40,457
Sounds like
the East Germans

1391
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:43,226
are fighting for
a place at our table.

1392
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:46,296
The GDR gets Abel back
for the Russians,

1393
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:47,497
winning their respect...

1394
01:32:47,531 --> 01:32:50,300
And capturing the headlines
for their cause.

1395
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:52,569
Which, of course,
puts East Germany on the map.

1396
01:32:52,602 --> 01:32:55,305
But we don't care
about their map.

1397
01:32:55,338 --> 01:32:56,806
Stick with
the Russians.

1398
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,442
Stick with the Russians.
It's Powers for Abel.

1399
01:32:59,476 --> 01:33:02,612
So, does all this mean
this might actually happen?

1400
01:33:02,646 --> 01:33:04,514
Yeah, that's what
you seem to be telling me.

1401
01:33:04,548 --> 01:33:07,584
We'll put Abel on a plane,
he'll be here Friday.

1402
01:33:07,617 --> 01:33:09,619
So, if Schischkin
gets the okay,

1403
01:33:09,653 --> 01:33:11,821
all that's left is the
mechanics of the trade.

1404
01:33:11,855 --> 01:33:13,690
How we swap our guy
for their guy.

1405
01:33:13,723 --> 01:33:15,825
Our "guys." Two guys.

1406
01:33:15,859 --> 01:33:18,328
Powers and Pryor.

1407
01:33:18,361 --> 01:33:21,298
No, now don't go
bleeding heart on me.

1408
01:33:21,331 --> 01:33:23,533
Powers is the whole
ball game.

1409
01:33:23,567 --> 01:33:25,335
Forget this
Ivy League boy,

1410
01:33:25,368 --> 01:33:27,470
who obviously thought
it was a good idea

1411
01:33:27,504 --> 01:33:29,873
to study Soviet
economics in Berlin

1412
01:33:29,906 --> 01:33:31,608
in the middle
of the Cold War.

1413
01:33:33,376 --> 01:33:34,711
Powers is who we need.

1414
01:33:35,745 --> 01:33:37,547
You don't even
like Powers.

1415
01:33:38,815 --> 01:33:41,484
Everybody hates Powers.

1416
01:33:41,518 --> 01:33:45,722
He didn't kill himself and he let the
commies parade him on television.

1417
01:33:45,755 --> 01:33:48,291
He's the most
hated man in America.

1418
01:33:48,325 --> 01:33:50,827
After Rudolf Abel,
maybe.

1419
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:52,529
And me.

1420
01:34:01,538 --> 01:34:02,606
Now wake up!

1421
01:34:11,648 --> 01:34:13,516
I gotta sleep.

1422
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:14,851
I just gotta sleep.

1423
01:34:18,555 --> 01:34:19,723
I told you,
you can sleep

1424
01:34:19,756 --> 01:34:21,591
once we talk
what we need to talk.

1425
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:24,461
You must focus on me.

1426
01:34:24,494 --> 01:34:26,863
Your government doesn't care about you.
You know that.

1427
01:34:26,896 --> 01:34:28,098
Any of you.

1428
01:34:28,131 --> 01:34:31,801
You know that twelve
U-2 pilots incurred brain damage?

1429
01:34:31,835 --> 01:34:35,405
They're vegetables because of altitude,
insufficient oxygen.

1430
01:34:35,438 --> 01:34:37,407
But they keep you
flying, Gary.

1431
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,509
You and your friends.

1432
01:34:39,542 --> 01:34:42,946
They gave you this.
A scratcher, yes?

1433
01:34:42,979 --> 01:34:45,749
Potassium cyanide.

1434
01:34:45,782 --> 01:34:48,718
Does that look like
they care about you?

1435
01:35:17,814 --> 01:35:21,384
What is the construction
of the destructor unit?

1436
01:35:21,418 --> 01:35:23,453
By what means
is this unit operated?

1437
01:35:23,486 --> 01:35:26,589
With what explosives
is the unit charged,

1438
01:35:26,623 --> 01:35:28,458
and what destruction
is it capable of?

1439
01:35:29,025 --> 01:35:30,994
I don't know.

1440
01:35:31,027 --> 01:35:33,430
The pilots were never shown
any of the equipment.

1441
01:35:33,463 --> 01:35:35,732
How wide far
can the radar

1442
01:35:35,765 --> 01:35:37,667
map an area during
an overflight?

1443
01:35:37,701 --> 01:35:38,702
I don't know,
I don't know!

1444
01:35:38,735 --> 01:35:42,706
Were you making
the overflight on April 9th

1445
01:35:42,739 --> 01:35:45,442
over the industrial area
and MiG bomber base

1446
01:35:45,475 --> 01:35:46,543
at Baranovichi?

1447
01:35:46,576 --> 01:35:48,478
I was not.

1448
01:35:48,511 --> 01:35:49,879
This was my
first overflight.

1449
01:35:49,913 --> 01:35:53,850
I need to know about
engine-out to glide ratio.

1450
01:35:53,883 --> 01:35:56,920
How the plane
gets so high.

1451
01:35:56,953 --> 01:36:01,891
We know it reaches
altitude of 70,000 feet.

1452
01:36:01,925 --> 01:36:03,860
Gary, we know this.

1453
01:36:03,893 --> 01:36:06,496
And I need to know
where the planes have flown.

1454
01:36:06,529 --> 01:36:08,898
Where they
have flown, Gary.

1455
01:36:08,932 --> 01:36:10,600
And we must have
this talk now.

1456
01:36:13,803 --> 01:36:15,739
Now.

1457
01:36:15,772 --> 01:36:18,441
And then you can
sleep a little.

1458
01:36:22,645 --> 01:36:24,447
<i>Sir, wake up.</i>

1459
01:36:25,882 --> 01:36:26,882
Wake up, sir.

1460
01:36:29,753 --> 01:36:31,721
Sir, can you come with me, please?
Yeah.

1461
01:36:31,755 --> 01:36:33,790
We gotta move.
Yeah, of course.

1462
01:36:33,823 --> 01:36:35,058
Can you come with me, please?
Yeah.

1463
01:36:35,091 --> 01:36:36,659
Okay.

1464
01:36:37,727 --> 01:36:39,529
Got your glasses?
Uh-huh.

1465
01:36:39,562 --> 01:36:42,799
What time is it?
It's late, but we need to talk,

1466
01:36:42,832 --> 01:36:44,432
and then we need to
get on a plane, okay?

1467
01:36:45,668 --> 01:36:47,771
Yeah.
Yep. Upsy-daisy!

1468
01:36:47,804 --> 01:36:49,706
Upsy-daisy.
That's right.

1469
01:36:49,739 --> 01:36:51,007
There we go.
Keep it moving.

1470
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,509
Thank you.

1471
01:36:54,778 --> 01:36:56,479
Other way, other way.

1472
01:36:56,513 --> 01:36:57,547
There we go.

1473
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:58,815
You say a plane?

1474
01:36:58,848 --> 01:37:00,717
This way, please.
Keep moving.

1475
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:03,720
<i>So, I received
a favorable decision</i>

1476
01:37:03,753 --> 01:37:05,822
<i>from Moscow
on your proposal</i>

1477
01:37:05,855 --> 01:37:08,825
that we help our friends in the German
Democratic Republic

1478
01:37:09,092 --> 01:37:10,860
by exchanging

1479
01:37:10,894 --> 01:37:12,862
Mr. Powers
for Mr. Abel.

1480
01:37:14,864 --> 01:37:16,099
That's swell.

1481
01:37:16,132 --> 01:37:20,703
May I suggest the Glienicke Bridge
as a place of a swap?

1482
01:37:20,737 --> 01:37:22,005
Why not Checkpoint
Charlie?

1483
01:37:22,038 --> 01:37:24,707
We're not
looking for publicity.

1484
01:37:24,741 --> 01:37:26,676
The Glienicke Bridge
is very quiet,

1485
01:37:26,709 --> 01:37:27,977
especially early
in the morning.

1486
01:37:28,011 --> 01:37:30,780
Glienicke Bridge.
I'll run that by our side.

1487
01:37:30,814 --> 01:37:32,582
We can have Abel here
on Friday.

1488
01:37:32,615 --> 01:37:33,917
So, Saturday morning?

1489
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,985
Always impatience, yeah?

1490
01:37:36,019 --> 01:37:37,654
I want to get home
and get into bed.

1491
01:37:37,687 --> 01:37:39,956
So, Saturday morning?

1492
01:37:39,989 --> 01:37:41,591
5:30?

1493
01:37:41,624 --> 01:37:43,126
All right.

1494
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:44,861
We're done here.

1495
01:37:44,894 --> 01:37:46,129
This is a number,

1496
01:37:46,162 --> 01:37:49,599
in case anything
should come up.

1497
01:37:49,632 --> 01:37:50,733
All right.

1498
01:37:50,767 --> 01:37:52,702
Someone will answer
at any hour.

1499
01:37:53,803 --> 01:37:55,104
I don't expect
to use it.

1500
01:37:56,706 --> 01:37:59,008
Shall we toast
the arrangement?

1501
01:37:59,042 --> 01:38:00,577
Why not?

1502
01:38:02,178 --> 01:38:03,713
Armenian brandy.

1503
01:38:03,746 --> 01:38:05,515
Good bracer for your cold.
Thank you.

1504
01:38:06,683 --> 01:38:07,884
Would you mind...

1505
01:38:07,917 --> 01:38:09,752
This is not part
of our business

1506
01:38:09,786 --> 01:38:12,021
but I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

1507
01:38:12,055 --> 01:38:13,756
You do not
have to answer.

1508
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:14,991
I shall answer
what I know.

1509
01:38:15,992 --> 01:38:19,028
I like this guy,
your guy.

1510
01:38:19,062 --> 01:38:21,965
What happens to your guy
when he gets home?

1511
01:38:21,998 --> 01:38:24,000
Well, we have to make
a determination

1512
01:38:24,033 --> 01:38:26,703
whether our guy
is now your guy.

1513
01:38:26,736 --> 01:38:28,605
Now, as I said
to you before,

1514
01:38:28,638 --> 01:38:29,873
he's acted
honorably.

1515
01:38:29,906 --> 01:38:31,641
He's still your guy,
believe me.

1516
01:38:31,674 --> 01:38:34,644
Of course you will
say that if it were true

1517
01:38:34,677 --> 01:38:36,880
and if it were
not true.

1518
01:38:36,913 --> 01:38:39,182
I guess it has
come down to that, huh?

1519
01:38:39,215 --> 01:38:40,917
Well, forgive me
for pushing,

1520
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:43,786
but is he
in any danger

1521
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:46,122
if the determination
is made?

1522
01:38:46,155 --> 01:38:48,591
Well, goodness.

1523
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:51,194
As things are now,
everyone is in danger.

1524
01:38:51,227 --> 01:38:52,795
Cheers.

1525
01:38:52,829 --> 01:38:54,030
<i>Na zdorovie.</i>

1526
01:39:06,943 --> 01:39:08,878
There will be no exchange
on Glienicke Bridge.

1527
01:39:09,979 --> 01:39:11,915
Excuse me, sir.

1528
01:39:11,948 --> 01:39:13,983
There will be
no exchange.

1529
01:39:14,851 --> 01:39:16,719
Not for Frederic Pryor.

1530
01:39:16,753 --> 01:39:19,856
Mr. Vogel, I thought
yesterday we had agreed.

1531
01:39:19,889 --> 01:39:22,125
We agreed on an exchange,
Abel for Pryor.

1532
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:26,996
Now I learn you are
a rug merchant

1533
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:29,899
selling the same rug
to two customers.

1534
01:39:29,933 --> 01:39:32,802
Abel for Pryor you sell to us.
Yeah.

1535
01:39:32,835 --> 01:39:35,038
And Abel for Powers
you sell to the Soviets.

1536
01:39:35,071 --> 01:39:37,707
I'm not quite sure
what the problem is

1537
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:40,944
if the arrangement satisfies
two parties or three or four.

1538
01:39:40,977 --> 01:39:42,111
What difference
does it make?

1539
01:39:42,145 --> 01:39:44,113
The arrangement does not
satisfy this party.

1540
01:39:48,985 --> 01:39:50,019
Now, Mr. Vogel, please...

1541
01:39:50,053 --> 01:39:52,989
Obviously you do not know
who you are dealing with.

1542
01:39:55,058 --> 01:39:57,694
Here's the interest
of the German Democratic Republic.

1543
01:39:58,995 --> 01:40:00,196
To deal with,

1544
01:40:00,229 --> 01:40:03,099
and to be seen to be dealing
with another sovereign power,

1545
01:40:03,132 --> 01:40:04,767
the United States.

1546
01:40:04,801 --> 01:40:06,869
An equal power.

1547
01:40:06,903 --> 01:40:08,271
Instead you treat us
as stooges

1548
01:40:08,304 --> 01:40:10,273
for the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1549
01:40:10,306 --> 01:40:12,709
Can we just call them the Russians?
It'll save time.

1550
01:40:14,177 --> 01:40:16,145
I have an appointment, sir.

1551
01:40:16,179 --> 01:40:17,947
I think it's you
who are wasting time.

1552
01:40:17,981 --> 01:40:20,016
Now, tell me if
I am describing this wrong.

1553
01:40:20,049 --> 01:40:21,784
You have a kid,
a university student,

1554
01:40:21,818 --> 01:40:23,152
someone you know
is not a spy,

1555
01:40:23,186 --> 01:40:24,687
who's no threat to you.

1556
01:40:24,721 --> 01:40:26,155
And in exchange
for this person

1557
01:40:26,189 --> 01:40:27,924
who is worthless to you,

1558
01:40:27,957 --> 01:40:30,126
you play an equal part
in an exchange

1559
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,228
between the Russians
and the Americans.

1560
01:40:32,261 --> 01:40:36,766
And this is one transaction
between us and the two of you.

1561
01:40:36,799 --> 01:40:38,234
We're not trying to do
two things here, sir.

1562
01:40:38,267 --> 01:40:39,969
We're just doing one thing.
One, one, one.

1563
01:40:40,003 --> 01:40:45,074
It's hard for me to see how the
Republic of East German Democrats is being slighted.

1564
01:40:45,108 --> 01:40:47,977
You agreed with the Soviets
without consulting me.

1565
01:40:48,011 --> 01:40:49,946
Is this a negotiation
or a conspiracy?

1566
01:40:49,979 --> 01:40:50,880
For it to be
a conspiracy,

1567
01:40:50,913 --> 01:40:52,081
there would have to be
harm to you, sir.

1568
01:40:52,115 --> 01:40:55,051
There's just benefits here.
We're of agreeing interests.

1569
01:40:55,084 --> 01:40:57,020
No, you decide
they agree.

1570
01:40:58,021 --> 01:40:59,756
Where is your
appointment, sir?

1571
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:01,190
In the West.
Ku'damm.

1572
01:41:01,224 --> 01:41:02,224
Good.

1573
01:41:13,369 --> 01:41:14,537
Look around you.

1574
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:18,074
How does the Eastern sector
compare with the West? Hmm?

1575
01:41:20,109 --> 01:41:22,078
Our Russian friends
have decided that

1576
01:41:22,111 --> 01:41:24,047
we should not rebuild
our capital city.

1577
01:41:26,315 --> 01:41:29,819
But we live in this ruin
made by our Russian friends.

1578
01:41:29,852 --> 01:41:31,821
Go ahead, make your deal
with these Russians.

1579
01:41:31,854 --> 01:41:33,022
We won't be part of it.

1580
01:41:35,124 --> 01:41:36,325
There is no deal
without Pryor.

1581
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:37,326
We are not
leaving him here.

1582
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,362
Is this your position
or your government's?

1583
01:41:39,395 --> 01:41:43,166
Sir, I'm here.
I'm talking to you.

1584
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:45,134
But you are not a representative
of your government.

1585
01:41:45,168 --> 01:41:47,870
You don't know who you are.
Neither do we.

1586
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:50,206
You should be careful.
This is not Brooklyn, Mr. Donovan.

1587
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,282
Look, sir.

1588
01:41:59,315 --> 01:42:01,150
You must know that
in every respect that matters,

1589
01:42:01,184 --> 01:42:03,352
I represent
my government.

1590
01:42:03,386 --> 01:42:04,887
You know who I am.

1591
01:42:06,022 --> 01:42:07,056
Do I?

1592
01:42:13,029 --> 01:42:14,831
Uh-oh.

1593
01:42:29,145 --> 01:42:31,981
Do you have
the proper papers?

1594
01:42:32,014 --> 01:42:34,884
Of course not.
It doesn't matter.

1595
01:42:34,917 --> 01:42:36,085
An American lawyer
like you

1596
01:42:36,119 --> 01:42:37,887
can talk your way
out of anything.

1597
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,122
Can't you?

1598
01:43:21,931 --> 01:43:23,866
You go with him.

1599
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:26,402
Why?
It's passport problem.

1600
01:43:26,435 --> 01:43:28,004
What... What problem?
What's the problem?

1601
01:43:28,037 --> 01:43:29,238
You go with him.

1602
01:43:32,141 --> 01:43:33,476
And remember,

1603
01:43:33,509 --> 01:43:35,278
we control the fate
of Frederic Pryor.

1604
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:21,284
My God!

1605
01:45:56,819 --> 01:45:59,255
Yeah,
I'll start with some coffee, please.

1606
01:45:59,288 --> 01:46:01,457
Then I'll have
the Hilton combo

1607
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:03,326
and the American
breakfast.

1608
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:04,460
And coffee.

1609
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:05,561
Both breakfasts?

1610
01:46:05,594 --> 01:46:07,129
Yeah, yeah.

1611
01:46:07,163 --> 01:46:08,364
One first or...

1612
01:46:08,397 --> 01:46:10,099
Both first, both.
Whenever they're ready.

1613
01:46:10,132 --> 01:46:12,101
And coffee.
Hmm.

1614
01:46:29,685 --> 01:46:31,454
You shouldn't be here.

1615
01:46:31,487 --> 01:46:32,655
Well, sometimes
in Germany,

1616
01:46:32,688 --> 01:46:34,557
you just want a big
American breakfast.

1617
01:46:38,627 --> 01:46:40,663
What happened?
Where were you last night?

1618
01:46:40,696 --> 01:46:43,666
Vogel arranged for me
to spend some time in the East.

1619
01:46:43,699 --> 01:46:45,267
Oh, Jesus.

1620
01:46:45,301 --> 01:46:46,535
Frankly, it's not
that much worse

1621
01:46:46,569 --> 01:46:48,404
than where you have me
here in the West.

1622
01:46:50,473 --> 01:46:54,143
So the Russians are fine
with the exchange,

1623
01:46:54,176 --> 01:46:56,679
but now Vogel is saying
that the East Germans won't do it.

1624
01:46:56,712 --> 01:46:57,712
We're not gonna
get Pryor.

1625
01:46:59,115 --> 01:47:01,117
Great, good.

1626
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:03,152
So the Soviets are set.
We get Powers.

1627
01:47:03,185 --> 01:47:04,453
We get Powers.

1628
01:47:04,487 --> 01:47:06,489
Well done.

1629
01:47:06,522 --> 01:47:08,557
No, the East Germans
won't do it.

1630
01:47:08,591 --> 01:47:10,693
We won't get Pryor,
and that kid matters.

1631
01:47:10,726 --> 01:47:12,428
Every person matters.

1632
01:47:12,461 --> 01:47:15,498
Sure, that's why you tried.
That's why you tried.

1633
01:47:15,531 --> 01:47:17,566
Abel's on his way,
so we're all set for tomorrow morning.

1634
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,169
Wait a minute.
Makes things simple.
Makes things simple.

1635
01:47:20,202 --> 01:47:22,471
We are not
getting the kid.

1636
01:47:22,505 --> 01:47:24,640
Yeah, I understand.
We're set.

1637
01:47:24,673 --> 01:47:26,473
We can ignore the message
we got this morning.

1638
01:47:28,277 --> 01:47:29,512
What message?

1639
01:47:29,545 --> 01:47:30,679
From the East Germans.

1640
01:47:30,713 --> 01:47:32,648
They called the number
I gave you.

1641
01:47:32,681 --> 01:47:35,184
They said they wanted
to speak to you today.

1642
01:47:35,217 --> 01:47:37,186
Vogel called?
No, um...

1643
01:47:37,219 --> 01:47:39,555
Office of, uh,
Harald Ott,

1644
01:47:39,588 --> 01:47:41,157
East German
attorney general.

1645
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:42,658
Wanting what?
What does he want?

1646
01:47:42,691 --> 01:47:43,793
Well, to talk to you.

1647
01:47:43,826 --> 01:47:46,729
But it's okay,
I can't ask you to go back there.

1648
01:47:46,762 --> 01:47:49,365
And listen, you seem to be
persona non grata to some elements,

1649
01:47:49,398 --> 01:47:50,699
so we won't
push our luck.

1650
01:47:50,733 --> 01:47:52,735
So he wants to see me.

1651
01:47:52,768 --> 01:47:54,703
What time?

1652
01:47:54,737 --> 01:47:57,673
Oh, no, no. Now, listen.

1653
01:47:57,706 --> 01:47:59,742
You don't need to go.
In fact, you shouldn't go.

1654
01:47:59,775 --> 01:48:02,211
In fact, you can't go.

1655
01:48:02,244 --> 01:48:04,580
We're set with the Soviets.
We don't want to screw it up.

1656
01:48:04,613 --> 01:48:06,549
I'm not gonna screw it up.
You're not going!

1657
01:48:06,582 --> 01:48:08,150
Don't be a pain in the ass.

1658
01:48:08,184 --> 01:48:09,552
Oh, I ordered.

1659
01:48:09,585 --> 01:48:11,654
Enjoy your big
American breakfast.

1660
01:48:21,397 --> 01:48:23,332
I thought it should
be negotiated

1661
01:48:23,365 --> 01:48:25,568
at the highest level
as a courtesy to you.

1662
01:48:25,601 --> 01:48:27,403
I thank you, sir.

1663
01:48:29,638 --> 01:48:32,508
I don't know how things
became so confused.

1664
01:48:32,541 --> 01:48:35,344
Well, I guess sometimes
they just do.

1665
01:48:39,815 --> 01:48:41,417
For sake of clarity,

1666
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:43,786
I say we are fully
prepared to exchange

1667
01:48:43,819 --> 01:48:48,524
the so-called student, Pryor,
for Rudolf Abel.

1668
01:48:48,557 --> 01:48:51,393
I understand from Mr. Vogel
that Pryor is very important to you.

1669
01:48:51,427 --> 01:48:52,795
Yes, but...

1670
01:48:52,828 --> 01:48:55,397
Ah, we'll do a memorandum
to that effect.

1671
01:48:56,765 --> 01:48:58,701
Oh, a memorandum.

1672
01:48:58,734 --> 01:49:02,204
Certainly, we commit
to a bi-lateral exchange.

1673
01:49:03,739 --> 01:49:08,277
Yes, yes, sure. I'm not sure
what that means but...

1674
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:12,681
My country also insists
on Francis Gary Powers.

1675
01:49:12,715 --> 01:49:13,782
No!

1676
01:49:18,854 --> 01:49:22,525
This is how things
became so confused.

1677
01:49:22,558 --> 01:49:25,294
Powers. What use
is he, sir?

1678
01:49:25,327 --> 01:49:27,229
You want him back for
punitive reasons?

1679
01:49:27,263 --> 01:49:28,464
What's done is done.

1680
01:49:28,497 --> 01:49:29,798
He has divulged
what he will divulge,

1681
01:49:29,832 --> 01:49:32,635
as no doubt
Abel has also.

1682
01:49:32,668 --> 01:49:37,439
We are offering instead
someone who you insist is innocent.

1683
01:49:37,473 --> 01:49:38,774
And this is right.

1684
01:49:38,807 --> 01:49:40,442
This is who
you should retrieve.

1685
01:49:40,876 --> 01:49:42,511
The future.

1686
01:49:42,545 --> 01:49:43,905
Look to the future.

1687
01:49:47,483 --> 01:49:48,551
Ott.

1688
01:49:51,387 --> 01:49:53,389
Ott.

1689
01:50:01,764 --> 01:50:03,766
I'm sorry. If you could
give me a moment, sir.

1690
01:50:23,752 --> 01:50:25,888
I'm very sorry, sir.
The attorney general regrets

1691
01:50:25,921 --> 01:50:28,591
that he had to leave
on urgent business.

1692
01:50:28,624 --> 01:50:31,860
He left?
Yes. Many apologies.

1693
01:50:31,894 --> 01:50:34,296
I've been waiting
for over an hour.

1694
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:35,664
Very sorry, sir.

1695
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,401
Young man.

1696
01:50:41,537 --> 01:50:42,638
Come here.

1697
01:50:44,406 --> 01:50:45,841
It's all right.
Come here.

1698
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:53,616
Uh...
Take a seat.

1699
01:50:55,684 --> 01:50:57,653
Oh, come on, come on.
Sit down.

1700
01:51:01,824 --> 01:51:03,559
Do you like
your job here?

1701
01:51:04,426 --> 01:51:05,794
It's a very
good job, sir.

1702
01:51:05,828 --> 01:51:07,930
It must be.
Must be interesting.

1703
01:51:07,963 --> 01:51:09,398
Oh, yes, sir.

1704
01:51:09,431 --> 01:51:11,533
And important, too.

1705
01:51:11,567 --> 01:51:14,536
And your English is...
Is good.

1706
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:16,572
Yes, I hesitate to say
it's excellent.

1707
01:51:16,605 --> 01:51:17,473
But it's excellent,
sir.

1708
01:51:17,506 --> 01:51:19,541
Good, good.
Good.

1709
01:51:19,575 --> 01:51:22,478
See, I just lost my
negotiating partner,

1710
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:24,546
and I need
somebody to talk to,

1711
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:26,515
and you seem like
a reasonable young man.

1712
01:51:27,816 --> 01:51:29,451
Can I talk to you?

1713
01:51:30,786 --> 01:51:31,786
Uh...

1714
01:51:32,621 --> 01:51:33,856
It's all right.

1715
01:51:33,889 --> 01:51:35,658
It's all right.
I just...

1716
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,828
I just need you to give
a message to your boss.

1717
01:51:42,398 --> 01:51:43,958
But it has to be
very, very, very clear.

1718
01:51:45,434 --> 01:51:46,502
You understand?

1719
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:50,906
Yes, sir. But perhaps
you should wait until he...

1720
01:51:50,939 --> 01:51:54,410
No, no. The thing is,
I have this cold and I wanna get home

1721
01:51:54,943 --> 01:51:56,812
and get in bed.

1722
01:51:58,580 --> 01:51:59,982
Can you give him
the message?

1723
01:52:00,015 --> 01:52:01,417
Certainly.

1724
01:52:03,419 --> 01:52:04,687
Well, this is
the message.

1725
01:52:06,755 --> 01:52:09,425
"There is no deal for
Abel unless we get Powers and Pryor."

1726
01:52:10,959 --> 01:52:13,429
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

1727
01:52:13,462 --> 01:52:14,630
It's arranged for
tomorrow morning.

1728
01:52:14,663 --> 01:52:16,999
It will not happen
unless we get two men.

1729
01:52:17,032 --> 01:52:18,734
Those two men.

1730
01:52:18,767 --> 01:52:20,436
Two, two, two.
Yes, sir.

1731
01:52:21,036 --> 01:52:23,806
If there is no deal,

1732
01:52:23,839 --> 01:52:25,474
your boss must tell
the Soviets.

1733
01:52:27,009 --> 01:52:28,744
He has to tell
the Soviets

1734
01:52:28,777 --> 01:52:30,813
that they are not
getting Rudolf Abel.

1735
01:52:33,015 --> 01:52:34,717
Yes, sir.

1736
01:52:37,653 --> 01:52:38,921
Oh, and tell him this.

1737
01:52:40,689 --> 01:52:43,659
That so far, Abel has been
a good soldier,

1738
01:52:43,692 --> 01:52:45,761
but he thinks
he's going home.

1739
01:52:47,963 --> 01:52:50,566
If we had to tell him
that he's not going home,

1740
01:52:50,599 --> 01:52:51,867
that the Soviets
don't even want him,

1741
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,502
that he's never
going home...

1742
01:52:53,535 --> 01:52:55,671
Well, I imagine his
behavior might change.

1743
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:00,609
And who will be held
responsible for that?

1744
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,681
That's a long message.

1745
01:53:05,714 --> 01:53:07,750
Uh, did you get it all?

1746
01:53:07,783 --> 01:53:09,952
Yes, sir. Got it.
Good.

1747
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:12,755
You're a good man.

1748
01:53:13,822 --> 01:53:14,823
Oh...

1749
01:53:15,724 --> 01:53:17,459
And also tell him

1750
01:53:17,493 --> 01:53:18,660
there's no deal
unless we hear

1751
01:53:18,694 --> 01:53:20,529
before the end of
business today.

1752
01:53:20,562 --> 01:53:21,830
He has the number.

1753
01:53:21,864 --> 01:53:23,866
If the exchange
isn't gonna happen,

1754
01:53:23,899 --> 01:53:25,934
no reason for everybody
to get up first thing in the morning.

1755
01:53:25,968 --> 01:53:29,671
No, sir,
that would be pointless.

1756
01:53:29,705 --> 01:53:32,508
You're kidding me!
You're kidding me!

1757
01:53:32,541 --> 01:53:34,710
Not really.
I need some change.

1758
01:53:34,743 --> 01:53:36,979
This is exactly
what you weren't supposed to do.

1759
01:53:37,012 --> 01:53:39,815
My instructions were
to feel out the situation.

1760
01:53:39,848 --> 01:53:42,651
Your instructions
were to get Powers, not Pryor.

1761
01:53:42,684 --> 01:53:44,920
That was not the original deal.
You fouled it all up!

1762
01:53:44,953 --> 01:53:47,589
How do you know?
I feel pretty good about it.

1763
01:53:47,623 --> 01:53:48,991
You fucked it all up!

1764
01:53:49,024 --> 01:53:50,826
Oh, don't worry.

1765
01:53:50,859 --> 01:53:52,961
I think it's
gonna be fine.

1766
01:53:52,995 --> 01:53:54,730
How do you know?
You don't know that.

1767
01:53:58,867 --> 01:54:00,969
United States.
New York, New York.

1768
01:54:01,003 --> 01:54:02,538
<i>Danke.</i>

1769
01:54:03,605 --> 01:54:06,575
Look, this whole thing

1770
01:54:06,608 --> 01:54:09,511
has been to feel me out.

1771
01:54:09,545 --> 01:54:11,847
Would I swap one for one
and which one?

1772
01:54:12,915 --> 01:54:14,883
But I said
"No, two for one."

1773
01:54:14,917 --> 01:54:16,852
So they know
where we stand.

1774
01:54:16,885 --> 01:54:18,921
Yeah, what if they think
about it and say, uh...

1775
01:54:18,954 --> 01:54:21,089
"Forget it! You keep our guy,
we keep your guys"?

1776
01:54:24,026 --> 01:54:26,128
Well, then I have
fucked it all up.

1777
01:54:26,161 --> 01:54:28,664
Hey, honey! It's me.

1778
01:54:28,697 --> 01:54:31,567
Yeah. The fishing's
been great.

1779
01:54:33,569 --> 01:54:34,903
I'm in London,

1780
01:54:34,937 --> 01:54:36,937
just for one more meeting,
then I'm on my way home.

1781
01:54:38,173 --> 01:54:41,643
Yeah, yeah, I remember
that marmalade.

1782
01:54:41,677 --> 01:54:43,779
It's that shop
right by Regent's Park.

1783
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,015
All right, I will
if I have the time.

1784
01:54:47,049 --> 01:54:48,817
Hey, can I say
hi to Roger?

1785
01:54:50,052 --> 01:54:51,720
Could I say hi
to the girls?

1786
01:54:52,654 --> 01:54:53,789
Is anyone not busy?

1787
01:54:55,023 --> 01:54:57,526
Have they even noticed
I'm not around?

1788
01:55:53,815 --> 01:55:54,950
We're on.

1789
01:55:56,051 --> 01:55:57,653
Two for one.

1790
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:00,689
Hot dog.

1791
01:56:00,722 --> 01:56:02,858
Let's have a drink.

1792
01:56:02,891 --> 01:56:05,627
One wrinkle.
What is that?

1793
01:56:05,661 --> 01:56:08,130
They won't release
Pryor with Powers, not at the bridge.

1794
01:56:08,163 --> 01:56:09,898
They'll release him
at the same time.

1795
01:56:09,932 --> 01:56:12,034
When the Russians give us
Powers on the bridge,

1796
01:56:12,067 --> 01:56:14,703
they'll release Pryor
over Checkpoint Charlie.

1797
01:56:14,736 --> 01:56:16,238
What does that mean?

1798
01:56:16,271 --> 01:56:19,741
I think it means,
"We wanna have the last word."

1799
01:56:20,776 --> 01:56:21,777
But they will do it.

1800
01:56:22,878 --> 01:56:24,079
You tell me.
You felt them out.

1801
01:56:45,167 --> 01:56:46,768
Where are they?

1802
01:56:46,802 --> 01:56:48,136
Where's our guy?
Where's our guy?

1803
01:56:48,170 --> 01:56:49,771
They're late.

1804
01:56:49,805 --> 01:56:51,740
Nobody's late.
We're early.

1805
01:56:51,773 --> 01:56:53,208
May I?
Yeah.

1806
01:57:00,182 --> 01:57:01,249
Hoffman.

1807
01:57:01,283 --> 01:57:02,818
Yeah?

1808
01:57:02,851 --> 01:57:04,286
I think they have...

1809
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:06,054
What?

1810
01:57:06,088 --> 01:57:07,956
...snipers.

1811
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:09,257
Well,
I'm sure they do.

1812
01:57:10,158 --> 01:57:11,860
How are you
sure they do?

1813
01:57:12,327 --> 01:57:14,129
Because we have snipers.

1814
01:57:31,947 --> 01:57:33,081
Step out, sir.

1815
01:57:41,356 --> 01:57:42,791
Jim.

1816
01:57:47,029 --> 01:57:48,029
Dear Jim.

1817
01:57:50,065 --> 01:57:51,967
How are you?

1818
01:57:52,834 --> 01:57:55,003
Happy to see you.

1819
01:57:55,037 --> 01:57:56,972
Have you arranged
all this for me?

1820
01:57:57,005 --> 01:57:59,808
Well, let's see what this is before I...
I take credit for it.

1821
01:58:01,109 --> 01:58:03,045
Any word about Pryor
from Checkpoint Charlie?

1822
01:58:27,402 --> 01:58:29,104
Nothing cooking yet.

1823
01:58:35,844 --> 01:58:37,145
Excuse me, sir.

1824
01:58:37,179 --> 01:58:39,314
This is Lieutenant Joe Murphy,
United States Air Force,

1825
01:58:39,347 --> 01:58:41,083
here to identify Powers.

1826
01:58:41,850 --> 01:58:42,918
Lieutenant Murphy.

1827
01:58:43,351 --> 01:58:44,853
Sir.

1828
01:58:48,023 --> 01:58:49,825
There may be
a slight glitch.

1829
01:58:49,858 --> 01:58:51,993
I was a young man
when I left.

1830
01:58:52,027 --> 01:58:54,062
Who will they find
to identify me?

1831
01:58:55,297 --> 01:58:58,033
Well, I hope it's not your
East German family.

1832
01:58:58,066 --> 01:58:59,901
I doubt they could
identify each other.

1833
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:36,271
Looks like our party.

1834
01:59:44,112 --> 01:59:46,414
Well, let's go.

1835
01:59:46,448 --> 01:59:48,116
You can stay here,
Donovan.

1836
01:59:49,251 --> 01:59:50,385
Not likely.

1837
01:59:52,954 --> 01:59:54,122
Open the gate.

1838
02:00:09,171 --> 02:00:11,139
What do you think will happen
when you get home?

1839
02:00:11,907 --> 02:00:13,208
Uh, I think...

1840
02:00:14,242 --> 02:00:16,178
I'll have a vodka.

1841
02:00:19,014 --> 02:00:20,081
Yeah.

1842
02:00:20,982 --> 02:00:22,250
Yeah.

1843
02:00:22,284 --> 02:00:25,086
But, Rudolf, is there
not the possibility...

1844
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:27,189
That my people
are going to shoot me?

1845
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:29,424
Yes.

1846
02:00:31,226 --> 02:00:33,295
You're not worried?
Would it help?

1847
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:48,410
To answer your question,
my friend,

1848
02:00:48,443 --> 02:00:51,012
I acted honorably.
I think they know that.

1849
02:00:52,314 --> 02:00:54,182
But sometimes
people think wrong.

1850
02:00:54,216 --> 02:00:55,417
People are people.

1851
02:00:57,152 --> 02:00:58,486
Let's see how they
greet me.

1852
02:01:00,355 --> 02:01:01,990
What can I look for?

1853
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,463
If I'm embraced or just
shown the back seat.

1854
02:01:49,204 --> 02:01:50,338
<i>Da.</i>

1855
02:02:03,151 --> 02:02:04,519
Take off the hat.

1856
02:02:11,092 --> 02:02:12,294
Hey, Powers.

1857
02:02:14,095 --> 02:02:15,363
Hey, Murph.

1858
02:02:17,232 --> 02:02:18,466
Yeah, that's Powers.

1859
02:02:21,303 --> 02:02:23,505
All right,
Mr. Donovan. We go now!

1860
02:02:23,538 --> 02:02:25,006
Hang on.

1861
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,581
Believe me,
I will tell you.

1862
02:02:35,650 --> 02:02:37,185
There's no one here.

1863
02:02:40,522 --> 02:02:42,590
They're releasing another man
at Checkpoint Charlie.

1864
02:02:42,624 --> 02:02:44,626
We're just confirming
that he's there.

1865
02:02:44,659 --> 02:02:46,261
Now!

1866
02:02:46,294 --> 02:02:47,595
As per plan,
if you please.

1867
02:02:49,197 --> 02:02:50,632
Let's go.

1868
02:02:50,665 --> 02:02:53,501
Pryor will show up
or he won't. Let's go.

1869
02:02:53,535 --> 02:02:56,404
They're waiting to see
if we'll do it without him.

1870
02:02:56,438 --> 02:02:58,340
We just have to stand here,
show them we won't.

1871
02:03:00,141 --> 02:03:01,276
I don't give a shit
what they want.

1872
02:03:01,309 --> 02:03:03,611
We have our objective.
Go ahead, Abel.

1873
02:03:05,413 --> 02:03:08,283
Go ahead, sir.
You can go.

1874
02:03:08,316 --> 02:03:10,385
If it is not to plan,
we go home.

1875
02:03:10,418 --> 02:03:12,354
We exchange now
or we go home!

1876
02:03:15,156 --> 02:03:17,359
You're waiting for another man?
Yup.

1877
02:03:18,426 --> 02:03:20,028
You want him, too.

1878
02:03:22,097 --> 02:03:23,331
I want him.

1879
02:03:23,365 --> 02:03:24,532
Doesn't matter
what he wants, sir.

1880
02:03:24,566 --> 02:03:26,368
I'm in charge and
you are free to go.

1881
02:03:27,302 --> 02:03:29,070
Please go.
Walk across.

1882
02:03:40,715 --> 02:03:42,117
I can wait.

1883
02:04:07,208 --> 02:04:09,577
It's something.
I'm not sure yet.

1884
02:04:11,646 --> 02:04:12,680
Hang on!

1885
02:04:57,659 --> 02:04:58,659
Let's go.

1886
02:05:05,333 --> 02:05:06,434
We got him!

1887
02:05:07,535 --> 02:05:08,703
Uh, I, uh...

1888
02:05:11,339 --> 02:05:13,174
I sent you a gift, Jim.

1889
02:05:14,275 --> 02:05:15,743
It's a...
It's a painting.

1890
02:05:17,479 --> 02:05:19,514
I hope it has some
meaning to you.

1891
02:05:21,749 --> 02:05:23,718
I'm sorry. I didn't think
to get you a gift.

1892
02:05:27,489 --> 02:05:29,357
This is your gift.

1893
02:05:32,694 --> 02:05:34,229
This is your gift.

1894
02:06:09,631 --> 02:06:10,631
You okay?

1895
02:06:12,467 --> 02:06:13,587
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

1896
02:07:33,548 --> 02:07:35,516
Mr. Donovan.

1897
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:37,485
Colonel Abel asked me
to give this to you.

1898
02:07:40,421 --> 02:07:41,556
Pardon me, sir.

1899
02:07:43,391 --> 02:07:44,871
Were you in charge
of this thing, sir?

1900
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:48,496
Yeah.
Well, I gotta thank you.

1901
02:07:49,397 --> 02:07:50,632
I gotta thank somebody.

1902
02:08:07,849 --> 02:08:10,652
I gave them nothing.
I gave them nothing.

1903
02:08:11,853 --> 02:08:13,788
It doesn't matter.

1904
02:08:13,821 --> 02:08:16,424
It doesn't matter
what people think.

1905
02:08:16,457 --> 02:08:17,525
You know
what you did.

1906
02:09:08,543 --> 02:09:09,711
Welcome home.

1907
02:09:11,946 --> 02:09:13,514
What a trip.

1908
02:09:18,586 --> 02:09:19,754
Mmm.

1909
02:09:23,024 --> 02:09:24,525
Mmm.

1910
02:09:24,959 --> 02:09:26,561
You okay?

1911
02:09:26,994 --> 02:09:28,663
Yeah, I'm fine.

1912
02:09:30,598 --> 02:09:32,600
Did you get the marmalade?
Yes, yes.

Yep. Yep.

On the corner!
Well, honey, I was busy.

I'm sorry.
We were so busy.
Oh, for Pete's sake.

How's Roger?
Is he home?
He's home.

Carol's home, Peggy's home.
Everyone's home.

1922
02:09:56,557 --> 02:09:58,693
Mom!
Come quick! Look!

1923
02:09:59,961 --> 02:10:01,996
