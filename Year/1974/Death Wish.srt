1
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,659
Hold it right there.

2
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,042
Hold it again.
Hold it.

3
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,920
Oh, come on, Paul.

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,338
One more.
One more.

5
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,724
You're not gonna show
those to anyone, are you?

6
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,180
- Sure. Why not?
- Ugh.

7
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,845
- You've got a prime figure.
- Heh.

8
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,805
- You really have, you know.
- Heh.

9
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,519
That's a euphemism for fat.

10
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,527
You wanna go back to the hotel?

11
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,868
What's the matter with right here?

12
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,368
We're too civilized.

13
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,875
I remember when we weren't.

14
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,000
But we'll go back to the hotel.

15
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,018
Paul, I don't wanna go back home.

16
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:58,202
<i>Trans World Airlines
passengers on TW76...</i>

17
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,622
<i>from Honolulu to New York should
proceed from the check-in counter...</i>

18
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,882
<i>to the Friendship
Lounge for boarding.</i>

19
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,129
Wanna know what happened while
you and Joanna were living it up...

20
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,166
in Maui or Kaui or
Yaui, whatever it is?

21
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:53,660
What?

22
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,546
There were 15 murders
the first week...

23
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,966
and 21 last week in this goddamn city.
- That's a lot.

24
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,637
You know, decent people are gonna have
to work here and live somewhere else.

25
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,727
By "decent people," you mean people
who can afford to live somewhere else.

26
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,610
Oh, Christ. You are such
a bleeding-heart liberal, Paul.

27
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,563
My heart bleeds a little
for the underprivileged, yeah.

28
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,199
The underprivileged are beating our
goddamn brains out. You know what I say?

29
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,532
Stick them in concentration camps.
That's what I say.

30
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,454
- Henry.
- Hello.

31
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:26,161
I've been running a cost-and-profit on the
Jainchill development in Tucson, Arizona.

32
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,296
Well, based on these figures...

33
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,458
I don't see how Blue Ridge
can underwrite 50 percent of it.

34
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,090
Well, Jainchill's been very
successful, in a small way.

35
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,762
Well, then I suggest
you send a man down...

36
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,427
from our San Francisco office
to step it out.

37
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,687
Redesign it, if necessary.

38
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,475
Because that's a high risk
for the acreage involved.

39
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,310
I'll talk to Inge about it.
Thanks, Paul.

40
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:59,827
Oh, uh, Paul, how does it feel to
be back in the war zone after Hawaii?

41
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,371
I was feeling pretty good
until I ran into Sam...

42
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,542
and he delivered the
crime rate statistics.

43
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,044
What this city needs
is more cops than people.

44
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:13,169
You'll have to find other options,
Samuel. No one could pay the taxes.

45
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,465
$2.17.

46
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,885
Would you have these
delivered, please, Mary?

47
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:00,970
Goodbye.

48
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,470
Hey, I'm gonna do a thing.

49
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,347
Shit, man.
Got business.

50
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,982
Let's go, man.

51
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,711
I'll get it.

52
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,970
Who is it?

53
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,638
Groceries, ma'am.

54
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,116
Nobody gets hurt, Mother.
Just hold still. Don't move.

55
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,416
What do you want?

56
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,919
Don't jive, Mother.
You know what we want.

57
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,793
- He's not gonna hurt us?
- Not if you got money.

58
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,921
Nobody, nobody.

59
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,303
Hey, Mother.
Look at the artiste doing his art.

60
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,093
- Ain't that beautiful, Mother?
- My purse is in the kitchen.

61
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,761
Just stand still.

62
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,182
We'll do as they say, Carol.
Where is your purse?

63
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,907
- Shit, you only got four bucks.
- I got three, and two bits.

64
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,785
You're gonna get
the shit kicked out of you, Mother.

65
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,784
- It's all we have.
- Rich people like you?

66
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,045
- Shit, we want money, Mother. Now get it!
- It's true. That's all we...

67
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,341
- How'd you like to get fucked?
- No!

68
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,844
I'm gonna stick you in the ass.

69
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,971
Leave her alone!

70
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,605
Goddamn rich cunt!

71
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,440
I kill rich cunts.

72
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,561
Mother's getting the
shit kicked out of her.

73
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,865
Hey, let's screw
this one, man. Huh?

74
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,452
- No, man. Let's travel.
- No, man. Let me paint her ass.

75
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,965
Hey, man. You think you're an artiste?
I'll show you how to paint, man.

76
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,099
I'm gonna paint her goddamn mouth!

77
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,637
He's gonna paint your mouth.
You're gonna like that.

78
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,518
You get any ideas about biting my
paintbrush, you'll get what Mother got.

79
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,355
- You're gonna swallow that paint.
- She'll swallow the paint.

80
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,186
Open that goddamn throat!

81
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,405
Mother's going for the phone!

82
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,288
Shit, let's split.

83
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,153
Thelma, will you get my wife
on the phone, please?

84
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,403
Mr. Kersey's office.

85
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,584
- Is it my wife?
<i>- No, sir. It's your son-in-law.</i>

86
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,495
Hello, Jack.

87
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,955
Dad.

88
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,086
Dad, we got trouble.

89
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,008
Trouble? You and Carol?

90
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,335
Don't tell me about it.

91
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,261
No, no. Dad...

92
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,298
It's Mom and Carol.

93
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,685
They're taking them to the emergency
receiving at Canal Hospital.

94
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,517
- What the hell for?
- <i>Look, I don't know.</i>

95
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,564
The police just called me.

96
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,142
What's happening, Jack?

97
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,185
<i>I don't know any more
than that, Dad.</i>

98
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,069
Look, I'm at my office, I'm going to
the hospital, just meet me there, okay?

99
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,737
<i>Dr. Fanning,
go to the emergency room, stat.</i>

100
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,497
<i>Dr. Fanning,
go to the emergency room.</i>

101
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,078
<i>Dr. Diaz...</i>

102
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,418
How are they?
Are they all right?

103
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,749
I don't know. I just got here
a few minutes ago.

104
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,840
Do you know anything?
Were they cut, stabbed, what?

105
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,046
I...

106
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,210
No, sir. Just beat up.

107
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,055
This is Officer Joe Charles, he came
in the ambulance with Morn and Carol.

108
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,842
- They gonna be all right?
- I've told Mr. Toby all I know.

109
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,012
If there's anything I can do,
ask for me at the 21st precinct.

110
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,475
Good luck to you.

111
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,937
Come on, Dad.
We might as well go sit down.

112
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,271
What'd they tell you?

113
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,860
Not much.

114
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,108
Yeah, but what?

115
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,616
They beat them both up.

116
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,575
Who did? Why?

117
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,804
Take it easy, Dad.
I'm just as rattled as you are.

118
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,954
The officer said that Carol
wasn't making much sense.

119
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,206
Two, maybe three men, they...

120
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,165
She opened the door
to let them in...

121
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,082
because she thought it was the
delivery boy from the supermarket.

122
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,135
Jesus God.

123
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,555
When are we gonna know something?

124
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,937
Will the following
doctors go to the emergency room, stat:</i>

125
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,347
<i>Dr. White...</i>

126
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,231
They know we're here?

127
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,863
The nurses know.
I spoke to one of them.

128
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,253
Somebody ought to come.

129
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,694
There's a man over there.
He's bleeding, and nobody comes.

130
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,622
Nurse, we're waiting to find out
what happened to my wife and daughter.

131
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,784
A doctor will see you
after he's made his examination.

132
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,872
But we've been
waiting a long time.

133
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,251
It hasn't been that long, Dad,
just two or three minutes.

134
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,293
- Mr. Toby?
- Yes.

135
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,803
Your wife is all right.

136
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,880
We've sedated her
and put her to bed.

137
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,217
My name is Paul Kersey.
How's my wife?

138
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,223
I'm sorry.

139
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,976
She died a few minutes ago,
Mr. Kersey.

140
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,607
<i>Almighty God, we commend
to you our neighbor Joanna...</i>

141
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,113
trusting your love and mercy...

142
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,072
and believing in the promise of
a resurrection to eternal life...

143
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,284
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.

144
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:15,170
Almighty God, father of the whole
family in heaven and on earth...

145
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,459
stand by those who sorrow...

146
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,217
that as they lean on your
strength, they may be upheld...

147
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,383
and believe the good news
of life beyond life...

148
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,936
through Jesus Christ,
our lord. Amen.

149
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,956
I'm going back with
Sam and Adele.

150
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,992
They go right by my place.

151
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,044
Don't you wanna come
to our apartment?

152
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,252
It's time I went to my own,
I have to sometime.

153
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,087
Baby?

154
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,839
Baby?

155
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,551
I'm going back with Sam.

156
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,719
You get plenty of rest.

157
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,478
She'll be all right, Dad.

158
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,600
<i>Residents
of northern suburbs...</i>

159
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,478
<i>will need quite some time to dig
themselves out of a snowstorm...</i>

160
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,184
<i>that's taking much
of Connecticut...</i>

161
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,566
<i>and Rockland and Westchester
Counties by surprise.</i>

162
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,938
<i>In New York City...</i>

163
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,194
<i>light snow flurries lingering
till about midnight.</i>

164
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,526
<i>- No accumulation, but afternoon...</i>
- Turn that thing off.

165
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,306
I'm listening to the weather.
Why haven't you found my dog?

166
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:06,308
He's vital to my income.

167
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,116
He paints such marvelous
pictures with his paws.

168
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,786
- Yes. Help you?
- Where can I find Officer Joe Charles?

169
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,792
- What's your business?
- Well, my name is Paul Kersey.

170
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,590
A couple days ago, my wife
and daughter were attacked...

171
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,593
and he was one of the policemen
on the scene, I wanna talk to him.

172
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,260
Yeah, well,
okay, so I think the...

173
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:32,177
Hattie, is Joe Charles still back
there or has he gone on duty yet?

174
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,058
Yeah, there's someone out here
who wants to talk to him.

175
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,815
- I told you somebody...
- Have a seat. He'll be right out.

176
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,438
.-.Snatched my purse!
The man came up from behind me.

177
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,605
My credit cards is in there,
my rent money, I don't have no key.

178
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,398
- Do I have a description?
- Yes.

179
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,034
The man came from behind me!

180
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,115
- You didn't see who it was?
- No, I didn't see!

181
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,282
- Hello, Mr. Kersey.
- Officer Charles.

182
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,953
I dropped by to see if
you had any information

183
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:57,936
on the people who
attacked my family.

184
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,671
I'll take you to the detective
in charge of the case.

185
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,846
- Uh, lieutenant?
- Yeah.

186
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,730
This is Mr. Paul Kersey, case number 884.
His wife and daughter were assaulted.

187
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,102
- Glad to know you, Mr. Kersey.
- I'm going on duty now...

188
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,687
so I'll leave.
- Thanks, officer.

189
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,477
- Not at all.
- Right this way, Mr. Kersey.

190
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,945
Will you have a seat, Mr. Kersey?

191
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,074
Have you found out anything yet?

192
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,571
Well, the supermarket security
officer and one of the checkers...

193
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,162
remembers these three characters leaving
right after Mrs. Kersey and your daughter.

194
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,122
They think they could've
gotten the apartment

195
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:39,944
number off the address
on the grocery bags...

196
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,876
but they haven't been able to pick
the faces out of the mug book.

197
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,420
How is your daughter, Mr. Kersey?

198
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,177
She's under doctor's
sedation right now.

199
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,095
But today I had the funeral
for my wife up in Connecticut...

200
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,600
and she was able to make that.

201
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,350
Your daughter didn't give us
much information, Mr. Kersey.

202
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,685
We wish we could persuade her
to look at the mug books.

203
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,976
Did she refuse?

204
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,445
Her husband asked us
to wait for a few days.

205
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,606
In fact, the sooner
she looks at the mug books...

206
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,947
the better chance she has of
recalling one or two of the faces.

207
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,538
Well, I'll talk to my son-in-law...

208
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,699
and see what can be done.
- I'd appreciate that, Mr. Kersey.

209
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,295
Any chance of catching these men?

210
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,048
There's a chance, sure.

211
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,463
Just a chance?

212
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,342
I'd be less than honest if I
gave you more hope, Mr. Kersey.

213
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,433
In the city, that's the way it is.

214
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,938
I thought you were asleep.

215
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,985
<i>Are you
getting the most out of life?</i>

216
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,577
<i>Are you satisfied,
fulfilled, happy?</i>

217
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,367
<i>Our bank has helped
many to a better future.</i>

218
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,716
- Good morning, Mr. Kersey.
- Morning.

219
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,770
Would you give me
$20 in quarters, please?

220
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,324
- Good morning, Paul.
- Morning.

221
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,575
Paul, you're tough.
You know, you really are.

222
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,368
I told Ives you'd
come in this morning.

223
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,539
I said, "Paul is not the kind of man to
leave the pieces of his life lying around.

224
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,503
He'll just start picking them up."

225
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,009
Just a matter of keeping busy, Sam.

226
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,384
Paul, welcome back.

227
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,515
- Good morning, Henry.
- See you for lunch, Paul?

228
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,598
- Yeah, sure.
- Paul, I'm gonna give you a vacation.

229
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,559
From New York, that is.

230
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,106
The Jainchill development
of Tucson, Arizona.

231
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,855
I want you to take it over.
Redesign it, if necessary.

232
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,365
Whatever you have to do.
All right?

233
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,778
That's all right, but can I give you
an answer in about a week?

234
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,663
I don't wanna leave New York
just now because of Carol.

235
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,035
Fine.

236
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,459
When you're ready, let me know.

237
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,209
Beautiful place, Tucson.
They can breathe out there.

238
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,469
She's sleeping too much.

239
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,934
It's not normal.

240
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,514
I've got a couple of TV dinners
in the oven. Come on.

241
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,307
It'll just be a couple of minutes.

242
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,856
Jack, this drink's enough for me.

243
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,815
- I've never seen you drink without eating.
- I'm not hungry.

244
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,829
I think maybe you ought to
take Carol to see another doctor.

245
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:47,242
I, uh... I did. Today.
A psychiatrist.

246
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:52,414
He seems to feel it might help her if I
took her away to another environment.

247
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,592
Out of New York,
on the shore someplace.

248
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,510
Sounds like a good idea.

249
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,923
- I'll go along with you.
- Uh... No, Dad. He...

250
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,524
He seemed to feel that
it might be better if

251
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,874
she didn't have any
association with anyone...

252
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,811
that might remind her of that day.
- How the hell do I remind her of that day?

253
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,979
Well, you know how it is, Dad.

254
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,607
I mean, it happened
in your apartment.

255
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:20,358
And you're living there.
You remind her of Morn.

256
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,572
Dad, don't make it tough for me.

257
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,583
Okay, I'll make it easy for you.

258
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,500
Ives asked me to go to
Tucson, Arizona on a job.

259
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:37,800
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know. Until I look the job over.

260
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,924
But you call me every other day,
let me know how Carol is.

261
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,514
Sure I will, Dad.

262
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,432
You know, that'll be good for you,
I hear Tucson's a really beautiful place.

263
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,437
Yeah, yeah.
That's what everybody says.

264
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,823
How are you today, sir?

265
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,077
Son of a bitch.

266
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,659
Turn around, son of a bitch.

267
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,328
Motherfucker! I said turn around.

268
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,414
And hand me the money.

269
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,373
Paul Kersey.

270
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,967
- Yeah.
- Aimes Jainchill.

271
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,635
How do you do, Mr. Jainchill?

272
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,138
Aimes. I'll call you Paul.
Come on. Let's get your bags.

273
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,266
- How did you know who I was?
- Well, you look like a New Yorker.

274
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,230
Ho!

275
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,527
Ho. Ho, ho.

276
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,201
Howdy, Jud.

277
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:03,582
I wanted you to see this country before you
looked at the drawings back at the office.

278
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,629
Give you a better idea.

279
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,717
I don't wanna change these hills.

280
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,174
Don't wanna bulldoze them flat.

281
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,929
You'll waste a lot
of building space.

282
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,687
Ha, ha! Wasting space.

283
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,102
Now, those are some words
that you big developers...

284
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,984
have got to change
for something else.

285
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,360
Such as?

286
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,362
Well, space for life.

287
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:32,527
Like old Jud up there.
Space for people, horses, cows.

288
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,455
I got funny ideas about
building things.

289
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,007
Howdy, folks, welcome to old Tucson,
the famous movie location and studio.

290
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,254
In just a few moments...

291
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,887
Unh. Come on. Let's wet our whistle
before I trot you back to the motel.

292
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,262
Glass of beer, maybe.

293
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,057
Take their positions on the
porches of the Red Dog Cafe...

294
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,057
the Territorial Gunsmith shop...
- What's happening here?

295
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,472
Oh, it's a phony western town.

296
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,730
They shoot movies here sometimes, but the
rest of the time, it's for the tourists.

297
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,405
This is where the actual
performance will take place.

298
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,880
These fellas are pretty good.
Wanna watch?

299
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:12,474
Sure.

300
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,492
where the Wild West lives again.

301
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,955
- Where's the marshal?
- He's in the bank.

302
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,078
I spotted him through the window
as I came by.

303
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,710
- What have you got in mind to do, then?
- Well, why don't you steal my horse?

304
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,871
All right.
That's a good trick. We'll use it.

305
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,668
You spot yourself on the porch while I
draw the marshal out into the open.

306
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,835
Marshal! Hey, marshal!

307
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,671
What's the matter, fella?

308
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,548
Somebody stole my horse.

309
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,054
I told you to get
out of town by sunset.

310
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,102
You missing a bay mare
that was tied to the hitching rail?

311
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,684
Saw a feller come and take her
just a spell ago.

312
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,562
Well, what did he look like?

313
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,235
Well, he was about
this tall, and he had this...

314
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,861
Get him, Frank!

315
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,261
Let's put him inside here and get to
the bank and make that withdrawal.

316
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,814
All right, boys. The fun's over.

317
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,272
Throw out your guns
and step out with your hands up.

318
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,901
You'd better listen, marshal.
I've got three sticks of dynamite here.

319
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,155
Don't be a fool.

320
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,626
The outlaw life
seemed a shortcut to easy money...

321
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,464
which could buy liquor, women,
and a turn at the gambling table...

322
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,802
but there were honest
men with dreams...

323
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,593
who would fight to protect their...
- Let's get that beer.

324
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,855
and who were to plant
the roots that would grow into a nation.

325
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,068
Blue Ridge won't buy it.

326
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,786
I don't build a thing that's gonna
be a slum in 20 years...

327
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,204
and I won't doze those hills.

328
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,037
What I build conforms to the land.

329
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,286
And you can't hear the
toilets flush next door.

330
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,298
You want our help,
you'll have to let me work on it.

331
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,503
Well, up to a point,
I want your help.

332
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,089
Up to a point, I'll give it.

333
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,729
When do I get a look-see?

334
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,778
In a couple days.

335
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,948
Guard says you were here
till after midnight last night.

336
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,609
Yeah. That's the way I work.

337
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,157
Somebody once said...

338
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,739
I forget who.
...that he never looked back...

339
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,203
because something might
be gaining on him.

340
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,873
What's gaining on you, Paul?

341
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,922
Twenty million dollar investment.
What else?

342
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,753
Well, I was gonna ask you to have
dinner with me at the club...

343
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,842
but I don't think
you'd be very good company.

344
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,221
No, I don't think I would.

345
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,748
It might amuse you, though.
Being from New York,

346
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:08,624
maybe you never seen
a club like this.

347
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,980
It's a gun club.
We shoot guns.

348
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:20,068
So goddamn much hoopla
from the gun control people.

349
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,407
Half the nation's scared
to even hold a gun!

350
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,285
You know, like it was a snake,
it was gonna bite you or something.

351
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,572
Hell, a gun is just a tool...

352
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,121
like a hammer or an ax.

353
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,127
Wasn't long ago,
used to put food on the table...

354
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:38,252
keep foxes out of the chicken coop,
rustlers off the range...

355
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,674
bandits out of the bank.

356
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,052
Paul, how long since
you held a pistol in your hand?

357
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,681
- A long time.
- Hm.

358
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,264
- Which war was yours, Korea?
- Yeah.

359
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,847
- See much action?
- A little.

360
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,518
Were you infantry?

361
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,019
- I was a CO in a medical unit.
- Oh.

362
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,314
Commanding officer, huh?

363
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,449
Conscientious objector.

364
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,743
Oh, Christ.

365
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,664
What a guest to bring
to a gun club. Heh.

366
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,790
You're probably one
of them knee-jerk liberals...

367
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,375
thinks us gun boys shoot our guns
because it's an extension of our penises.

368
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,836
I never thought about
it that way...

369
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,508
but it could be true.

370
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,835
Well, maybe it is...

371
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,262
but this is gun country.

372
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,594
Can't even own a handgun
in New York City.

373
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,055
Out here, I hardly know a man
that doesn't own one.

374
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,053
And I'll tell you something...

375
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,564
unlike your city,
we can walk our streets...

376
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,895
and through our parks
at night and feel safe.

377
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:42,529
Muggers operating out here, they'd
just plain get their asses blown off.

378
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,573
Here. Slip these on.

379
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,903
All righty.
This is a percussion pistol.

380
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,612
1842.

381
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,831
You ever handled one
of those before?

382
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,000
You know how to fire it?

383
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,082
Watch the kick.

384
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,134
Boy, you're gonna think that
your arm's gonna hit the ceiling.

385
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,934
Goddamn!

386
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,936
Paul, you hit dead center!

387
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,234
Mind if I try this Hogleg Colt?

388
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,770
No.

389
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:26,031
Well, you a peculiar
conscientious objector.

390
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,446
- These notches for real?
- Yeah.

391
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,987
Belonged to a gunfighter
named Candy Dan, 1890.

392
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,123
Hm. I do know something
about guns, Aimes.

393
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,035
I grew up with them.
All kinds of guns.

394
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,917
You see, my father was a hunter.

395
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,881
I guess out here you'd
call him a gunman.

396
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,759
My mother was the
other side of the coin.

397
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,056
When my father was killed
in a hunting accident...

398
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,430
Some fool mistook him
for a deer, you see.

399
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,936
My mother won the toss.

400
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,348
I never touched a gun since.

401
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,109
I loved my father.

402
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,907
There are your hills.

403
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,372
Every house has a part
of one for a backyard...

404
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,128
for kids, dogs, horses.

405
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,799
Four hundred houses,
100 more than you allowed for...

406
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,047
and you still have 12 hills.

407
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,597
I'm catching the 10:40
back to New York.

408
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,887
What do I tell them?

409
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,974
You tell them I'll buy
it if they will.

410
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,991
You're checking this bag
through, aren't you?

411
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,785
- Yeah.
- Good.

412
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,872
Let me slip a little going-away
present in there for you.

413
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,916
Thank you.

414
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,674
<i>Trans World Airlines Flight 63...</i>

415
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,736
<i>- ...from Tucson to New
York is now boarding...</i>

416
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:19,335
Good morning, sir.
How are you today?

417
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,062
Checking one bag?

418
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,812
Paul, I can't thank you enough
for what you did for me.

419
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,817
I want you to know if you ever
get tired of living in that toilet...

420
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,190
you're welcome here.

421
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,904
<i>Trans World airlines Flight 7...</i>

422
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,619
<i>to London and Frankfurt

423
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,284
<i>Passengers should

424
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,168
- Welcome home, Dad.
- Hi, Jack.

425
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,455
I halfway expected to see Carol.

426
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,965
Come on.
Let's go get your bags.

427
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,714
What is it?

428
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,263
She's in the hospital.

429
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,430
When I last spoke to you on the phone...

430
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,391
you said she was feeling better
after coming back from the shore.

431
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,226
Well, I didn't see any need to get you
all disturbed on a long-distance call.

432
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:11,568
<i>Will Mr. Cory, a passenger on
Trans World Airlines Flight 100...</i>

433
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,858
<i>from Vancouver,
please report to...</i>

434
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,900
Oh, come on, Dad,
don't do a number...

435
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,028
Don't do a number on me.

436
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,872
Look, there was
nothing you could do.

437
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,876
They haven't even let me see her
for two days.

438
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,956
They tried insulin
shock yesterday.

439
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,467
She's not responding.

440
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,425
You want the technical jargon?
I can reel off yards of it:

441
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:41,761
Catatonia, dementia praecox,
passive schizoid paranoia.

442
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,149
It all boils down to the fact that she's
had an experience that she can't face...

443
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,856
and she's running away from it
inside herself.

444
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,443
<i>Will Mrs. Lager, a passenger
on Trans World Airlines...</i>

445
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,027

00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,825
<i>please contact the

447
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,861
You didn't handle her right, Jack.

448
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,956
Aw, Christ, Dad.

449
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,201
I'll get other doctors.

450
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,797
- Who are these goddamn doctors you have?
- They're good doctors.

451
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,594
Dad,
she's almost a goddamn vegetable.

452
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,289
If you don't sign the papers,
what happens?

453
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,377
I guess they keep her in the hospital
until the insurance runs out.

454
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,841
That won't be too long.

455
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,724
If you sign the papers and
she's committed, what then?

456
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,850
Well, I've got an insurance policy
that covers it up to about 600 a month.

457
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,312
They've recommended
a sanatorium out in Long Island.

458
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,026
Jack...

459
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,319
This commitment,
is it a one-way thing?

460
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,285
Nobody can answer that, Dad.

461
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,538
You wanna know what they are?

462
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,200
<i>They're statistics
on a police blotter.</i>

463
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,870
Mom and Carol, along with
thousands of other people.

464
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,252
And there is nothing
that we can do to stop it.

465
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,792
Nothing but cut and run.

466
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:10,745
Oh, what a bummer, man. That was
the worst fucking movie I've ever seen.

467
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,254
You got money, man?

468
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,135
Shit, I'll kill you!

469
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,212
Give me your money
or I'll bust you up!

470
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,804
Oh, Jesus.

471
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,471
Oh, Jesus.

472
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,394
Jesus Christ.

473
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,474
Ohh. Oh, Jesus.

474
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,727
Good morning, inspector.

475
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,015
Good morning.
What do we got?

476
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,775
We got a corpse down here,
one bullet hole in his chest.

477
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,662
Fellow over there was jogging
through the park at daybreak,

478
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:31,922
found him on the path here.

479
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:36,033
- You got a make on the dead man?
- Yeah. His name is Thomas Leroy Marston.

480
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,286
He had a parole card,
we got a radio check on that.

481
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,573
He served 42 months of a five-year
hitch for grand larceny.

482
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,208
He's a drug addict.
He's probably popping smack again.

483
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,914
There's punctures, both arms.

484
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,580
We found this on the
grass next to him.

485
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,631
Thing hasn't been fired.

486
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,251
Deceased had a gun
clip on his belt.

487
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,634
Think it must be his.

488
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:59,887
What would you say if I suggested
that he tried a heist...

489
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,468
he got shot for his trouble?

490
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,262
Maybe two guys trying
to heist each other.

491
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,890
No, no.
This man wasn't robbed.

492
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,313
Still has money in his wallet.

493
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,669
- Good morning, Paul.
- Good morning.

494
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,551
- Hi, Paul. Morning.
- Morning, Sam.

495
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,889
Well, we've marked it out
as you've indicated.

496
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,395
It's beautiful.

497
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,101
What's our profit?

498
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,686
Uh... Not quite three million,
but I believe that our investment...

499
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,399
can be amortized in two years...

500
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,906
and it is a showplace operation.

501
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,816
Look at all that wasted space.

502
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,618
Jainchill loves those hills.

503
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,454
Besides, it's a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition.

504
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,115
Well, it's too pretty to leave.

505
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,126
Okay. I'll run it for the board.

506
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,042
- May need your help, Paul.
- Okay.

507
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,667
Oh, Tucson agreed with you.
You look well.

508
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,345
I feel, uh... Good.

509
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,806
Was he a white man or a black man?

510
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,316
I just don't know!

511
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,568
Come on.
They were under that streetlight.

512
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,821
I wasn't seeing too good.
I had blood in my eyes.

513
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,857
Well, was he tall? Short?

514
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,616
Thin? Fat?

515
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,741
Hank. Forget it, huh?

516
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,243
Ride the ambulance to the morgue.

517
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,914
When they get the slugs
out of those bodies...

518
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,004
run them over to the
lab for ballistics.

519
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,964
You saw him pretty
good, didn't you?

520
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,809
You're full of shit.

521
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,452
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

522
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,999
You know, if we had the brains
to live here in the country...

523
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,463
we wouldn't be here
for the reason we are today.

524
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,263
We'd be going into
the city to work.

525
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:52,972
And Mom and Carol would be safe at home,
waiting for us to come back.

526
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,845
Nothing to do but cut and run, huh?

527
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,313
Eh, what else?

528
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:02,686
What about the old American
social custom of self-defense?

529
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,864
If the police don't defend us,
maybe we ought to do it ourselves.

530
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,784
We're not pioneers anymore, Dad.

531
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,825
What are we, Jack?

532
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,240
What do you mean?

533
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,913
I mean, if we're not pioneers,
what have we become?

534
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,833
What do you call people...

535
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,967
who, when they're faced
with a condition of fear...

536
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,426
do nothing about it,
they just run and hide?

537
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,840
Civilized?

538
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,304
No.

539
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,189
Ladies and gentlemen...

540
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,446
we have to start
this investigation somewhere...

541
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,857
so let's start here.

542
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,823
Motive:

543
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,703
Revenge.

544
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,209
I want the records checked.

545
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,462
Go back, say, uh...

546
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,335
Three months.

547
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,250
Limit it to homicide.

548
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,753
We could be looking for
a man who's had a member...

549
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,048
or members of his family
killed by muggers.

550
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,929
Now, he shoots that
pistol pretty good.

551
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,563
Right?

552
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,649
Okay.

553
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,772
Combat veteran.

554
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,695
So put Vietnam vets
at the top of the list...

555
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,149
because they're youngest
and toughest.

556
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:35,198
Then you can work your way
through Korea and World War ll.

557
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:36,908
Oh, my God!

558
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,702
Who said that?

559
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,245
Hmm?

560
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,665
Well, whoever said it,
you're right on the button.

561
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:49,713
By God and Jesus Christ,
it's impossible...

562
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,095
but until we find a shortcut...

563
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,468
we'll at least keep busy.

564
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:59,973
So when the media demands to know what we
are doing to apprehend the vigilante...

565
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:04,474
we'll tell them we
have definite clues.

566
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,942
Okay?

567
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,405
We won't tell them we have
about a thousand definite clues.

568
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,360
There's a body
in there! Two of them!

569
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,583
- Where'd he go?
- Did anybody see what he looked like?

570
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,664
We're in Police Commissioner
Dryer's office...

571
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:19,176
waiting for a press conference
scheduled by Commissioner Dryer.

572
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,676
Last night, there was another double
killing, which appears to be the work...

573
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,388
of the person New York news media
have dubbed "The Vigilante."

574
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,779
This will be
the first official statement...

575
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,160
from Commissioner Dryer
on the Vigilante killings.

576
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,663
I can see the commissioner now
as he walks past...

577
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:52,201
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
With me is Inspector Frank Ochoa...

578
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:56,084
who has been placed in
command of a police detail...

579
00:56:56,246 --> 00:57:01,127
assigned to what we've all
been calling the Vigilante murders.

580
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:05,465
Now, it has been confirmed
by our ballistics laboratory...

581
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,851
that the same
gun, a .32 pistol...

582
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:12,476
which was used
in the previous three homicides...

583
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:16,024
was used last night in a shooting
aboard a subway train.

584
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:21,613
Now, I know that this person
has captured the imagination...

585
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,907
<i>of many people in our city...</i>

586
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,068
<i>and I wanna say to our citizens:</i>

587
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:31,282
<i>Murder is no answer
to crime in this city.</i>

588
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,122
<i>Crime is a police responsibility...</i>

589
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,248
<i>and if this person
is listening to my voice...</i>

590
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:42,210
<i>I urge him
in the name of law and order...</i>

591
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:48,557
<i>to desist from this one-man crusade
and turn himself in to the police.</i>

592
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,227
<i>He'll be given fair treatment.</i>

593
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,480
How do you like it?
That's our police commissioner...

594
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,606
that's Ryder, the
king of clichés.

595
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:59,439
<i>- vigilante's identification?
- No comment at this time.</i>

596
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,271
<i>Do you think this man's crazy?</i>

597
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,111
<i>Well, he's got a wire down, all right...</i>

598
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,159
<i>but I don't believe we're
dealing with a raving maniac.</i>

599
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,739
<i>Commissioner, it's rumored that
the rate of street muggings has dropped...</i>

600
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,408
<i>since The Vigilante became
headline news. Is that true?</i>

601
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,621
<i>Not true.</i>

602
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,961
<i>If it were true,
would you announce it, sir?</i>

603
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,839
<i>Or are you afraid that would stimulate
imitators of The Vigilante?</i>

604
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:24,002
<i>I don't wanna get into
these hypothetical questions.</i>

605
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,300
Mm. I bet muggings are down,
they're afraid to tell us.

606
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:31,141
There's only one way to find out:
Take a walk on Columbus Avenue tonight.

607
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,641
Thanks a lot, Paul, I think
I'll wait for the official report.

608
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,976
<i>successful,
regardless of the...</i>

609
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,274
Yes?

610
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:48,154
Ah. You wanna confess
to the Vigilante killings?

611
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,111
All right.

612
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,492
I'll put you through to Rosenberg.

613
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,077
He's in charge of
confessions today.

614
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,622
That's the 23rd.

615
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,294
Put him through.

616
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:03,131
We couldn't get any prints
off The Vigilante's groceries.

617
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,881
- Wasn't there a sales slip?
- Yeah. Here.

618
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:11,215
D'Agostino's.

619
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,095
Mm-hm.

620
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:18,351
Some of this code must identify
the particular store.

621
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,395
Find out where it is.

622
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,108
When we get the records...

623
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:26,022
check on families that have had
somebody killed by muggers.

624
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,699
Let's put them through the computer and
see if any of them live near this store.

625
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:35,448
People are inclined to buy groceries
in their own neighborhoods.

626
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,702
- Hi, Jack. Come on. Come on in.
- Dad.

627
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:40,915
Make yourself a drink.

628
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,090
Hey, what do you think?

629
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,670
The new paint?

630
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,875
Well, it's a little
hard on the eyes, but...

631
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:52,747
Hard on the eyes?
It's cheerful.

632
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,847
Hey, Jack. Turn it back up.
I can't hear.

633
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,194
We got liver and
spaghetti for dinner.

634
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,026
How do you like
your liver done?

635
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,986
- Uh...
- Hey, no drink?

636
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,487
Let me make you one.

637
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,453
No. Dad... Listen, that's all right.
I'll get it myself.

638
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,073
I, uh...

639
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,122
I saw Carol today.

640
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,379
- Aren't you gonna ask how she's doing?
- I know how she's doing.

641
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,336
I went up to see her yesterday.

642
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,751
Then what the hell
are you so high about?

643
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,804
What the hell you want me to do, moan
and groan for the rest of my life?

644
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,680
How do you want
your liver, medium?

645
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,102
Medium. I'll make it medium.

646
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,828
- Hey, there goes the pussy posse.
Ha-ha-ha!

647
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,839
Hey, mister, got a match?

648
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:36,090
Yeah.

649
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:37,838
What else you got?

650
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,926
Let's see the money, man.

651
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,309
- You'll have to take it.
- Shit.

652
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,224
He went that way.

653
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,772
Who rode the ambulance with him?

654
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:54,891
I did.

655
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,851
Well?

656
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:58,232
Was he talking?

657
01:04:58,258 --> 01:05:00,722
He said he cut whoever
it was that shot him.

658
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,401
Exact words:
"I cut that motherfucker. I hit him."

659
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:08,743
Can't save him.
Too much internal bleeding.

660
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,907
One slug chewed up the liver.

661
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,791
Here.

662
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,544
.32's.

663
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:24,221
<i>city tonight, the mysterious
Vigilante is in the news again.</i>

664
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:28,221
<i>A little more than two hours ago, in
an 8th Avenue subway underpass...</i>

665
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,636
<i>two men were shot.
One died on the spot.</i>

666
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:33,305
<i>The other managed to reach
the street before he collapsed.</i>

667
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,815
<i>He died shortly afterward
in the hospital.</i>

668
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:41,109
<i>The two men have been identified
as Joseph Roscoe Adams and George Reech.</i>

669
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,148
<i>Both had long criminal records.</i>

670
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,986
<i>The Vigilante himself
may have been wounded.</i>

671
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,702
<i>The actions of The Vigilante,
as lawless as they may be...</i>

672
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:56,203
<i>seem to be giving others new
attitudes toward crime in the streets.</i>

673
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,673
<i>Instead of helplessly allowing themselves
to be mugged and robbed...</i>

674
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,546
<i>a few are fighting back.</i>

675
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,548
<i>I have with me
Mrs. Alma Lee Brown...</i>

676
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:07,840
<i>who today successfully defended
herself against two muggers...</i>

677
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,508
<i>with an unusual weapon.</i>

678
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:13,554
<i>Mrs. Brown, would you tell us how
you drove off your attackers today?</i>

679
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,222
<i>With a hatpin!</i>

680
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:20,352
<i>- You ever seen a hatpin?
- I can't say that I have.</i>

681
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:24,273
<i>Well, that's what we used to use to
hold our hats on with, ha, ha...</i>

682
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:28,194
<i>and I ain't got no gun
like this Vigilante fellow...</i>

683
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:33,290
<i>but I went to my closet, and everybody
better look out for me from now on.</i>

684
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:38,537
<i>Because I've been robbed too many times,
and I've had enough!</i>

685
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,251
<i>Some of the men
building this skyscraper...</i>

686
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,917
<i>made what you might call
a citizens' arrest today.</i>

687
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,969
<i>I'll ask Andrew McCabe,
one of the foremen, to tell you about it.</i>

688
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,765
<i>Me and my crew was working
down in the hole.</i>

689
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,393
<i>One of the boys
up on the steel yelled down:</i>

690
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,269
<i>"There's a mugging going on!"</i>

691
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:59,395
<i>So we come out of the hole and through
the gate, and we caught this guy running.</i>

692
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:02,561
<i>And we roughed him up a little bit
before the police came.</i>

693
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,613
<i>The hospital report
says the man had two broken arms...</i>

694
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,992
<i>- ...a broken jaw, and cracked ribs.
- No kidding? Jeez.</i>

695
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,286
<i>Poor guy must have fell down.</i>

696
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,830
Walking distances
from D'Agostino's:

697
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:19,039
Two blocks crosstown,
six short blocks uptown and downtown.

698
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:21,830
I mean, that's how far
I'd be willing to walk to a market.

699
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,967
Ahem. Good.
Very good, Miss Gemetti.

700
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,465
We have 12 families
living within this area...

701
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,427
who have suffered a death
in the family in the past three months...

702
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,559
from mugging, stabbing,
shooting, assault.

703
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,266
Two of these families
have no male members.

704
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:40,227
One family has only
an 80-year-old grandfather.

705
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,484
That leaves nine families.

706
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,695
Total number of male persons
in these families...

707
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:50,074
who are old enough to have served in the
Vietnam War, Korea, or World War II...

708
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,235
comes to 14.

709
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:57,575
Wild. It's a real wild shot...

710
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,439
but the fact is that
The Vigilante plugged

711
01:08:01,465 --> 01:08:03,693
his first victim in
Riverside Park...

712
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:08,176
exactly two and one half blocks
from that D'Agostino market.

713
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:12,843
Even if all these guys are clean,
we still can't ignore that coincidence.

714
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,556
No, sir.

715
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,261
Our friend lives in
that neighborhood.

716
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:21,773
But, Frank, he was on a subway
with groceries five miles uptown.

717
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:26,479
There's no better come-on for a mugging
than a guy with a bagful of groceries.

718
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:30,361
Means he's got some money in his pocket
and his hands are occupied.

719
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:33,906
He might have been carrying
those groceries for hours.

720
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,281
I want a preliminary line
on these names.

721
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:44,706
Where they work, service record,
reputation, police record, if any.

722
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,504
And I want it fast.

723
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,504
You know, like today, huh?

724
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:57,134
It's probably having as much
effect on the total crime picture...

725
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,177
as putting a
Band-Aid on a leper.

726
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,425
Wait a minute, I
don't know about that,

727
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:03,670
a mugger's gonna think
twice about who he hits.

728
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,025
Sure. They're hitting more
old ladies, that's why.

729
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:08,858
Paul, how you doing?
Let me get you a drink.

730
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,404
The guy's a racist.

731
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,406
You notice he kills
more blacks than whites.

732
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,946
Oh, for Pete's sake, more blacks
are muggers than whites.

733
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,865
What do you want us to do, increase
the proportion of white muggers...

734
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,875
so we'll have racial equality
among muggers?

735
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:26,459
Racial equality among muggers?
Ooh. I love it!

736
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,711
He hasn't been the same
since that terrible incident.

737
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:08,584
- Who we got here?
- A guy named Paul... Kersey.

738
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,711
His wife was murdered
in their apartment.

739
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,626
Interesting detail:
The attackers, three of them...

740
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:16,384
gained entrance to the apartment
by posing as delivery boys...

741
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:20,267
from our D'Agostino's market, where
The Vigilante buys his groceries.

742
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,093
What else about him?

743
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,312
He lives alone now.

744
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:27,732
Development engineer
for the Blue Ridge corporation.

745
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,022
Served in Korea, medical corps.

746
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,444
Conscientious objector.

747
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:36,608
No police record.
Credits, reputation excellent.

748
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,115
Conscientious objectors
are unlikely vigilantes.

749
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:44,032
- We got a finger?
- Yeah. Over there.

750
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,335
Patrolman Joe Charles.

751
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,665
Good.

752
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,126
Good morning, Mr. Kersey.

753
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,423
Joe Charles, Mr. Kersey.

754
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,174
Oh, yes, of course.

755
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,385
How do you do?
Good to see you again.

756
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,183
How's your daughter?

757
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,227
The same.

758
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,308
Take care.

759
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:11,025
Follow him.

760
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,661
Yes, I'll see to that, Mrs. Cohen.

761
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,954
Just a moment.
You're not residents here.

762
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,914
Who do you wish to see?
I'll call up for you.

763
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,423
No, you won't.

764
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:21,189
The district
attorney will see you now.

765
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:33,827
- Commissioner.
- Frank, you know the district attorney.

766
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,375
- Mr. Peters.
- Inspector.

767
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:41,383
The commissioner says you
have a pretty good suspect.

768
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,384
Well, he fits the bill
in some respects.

769
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:49,012
We got a blood sample
from the knife...

770
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:52,520
used on him in the subway and
checked it against the sample...

771
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,305
I found in his apartment.

772
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:56,478
It narrows it down.

773
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:58,726
But in the balance,
he could be the man?

774
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:00,357
Yeah.

775
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,735
Yeah, he could be.

776
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:04,740
Frank...

777
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:09,408
Suppose this Paul Kersey
is The Vigilante.

778
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,914
All right. Let's say that.

779
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,042
We don't want him.

780
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:19,914
Okay.

781
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:24,837
Inspector, on my desk, I have a statistic
red-hot out of the computer.

782
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,091
Mm-hm.

783
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:29,302
Mugging has gone down
by how much, sir?

784
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,765
From 950 a week
to 470 reported last week.

785
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:35,930
You understand
not too many people know that.

786
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,358
And you wanna keep
it that way, huh?

787
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,020
Oh, no, we have to keep it
that way, inspector.

788
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,731
This whole city would explode.

789
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:48,819
We'd have vigilantes out in the street
killing anybody who even looked greasy.

790
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:53,115
- You can see that.
- We want this man to quit, desist...

791
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,834
go away.
To stop.

792
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,422
So the mugging rate can go up?

793
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:05,377
If I arrest him, wouldn't that
get him off the streets?

794
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:07,841
My God, man. I don't want
a martyr on my hands.

795
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:11,349
All right.
All right.

796
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,055
I just wanna hear you say it.

797
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,851
I'll try to scare him off...

798
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,654
but that's as far as I'll go.

799
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:28,233
That's right, Frank.
Scare him off.

800
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,907
Scare him off?

801
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,005
Yes?

802
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,842
<i>A call for you from a man
who says he's an old friend...</i>

803
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,756
<i>and wonders if you'll
recognize his voice.</i>

804
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:55,013
Do you want the call that way,
or shall I insist upon his name?

805
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:58,187
- Okay, I'll take it.
- <i>I'm putting you through.</i>

806
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,684
- Hello?
- Is this Paul Kersey?

807
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,566
Yes. Who's this?

808
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:10,570
Mr. Kersey, you're under
police surveillance.

809
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:13,119
<i>You're being watched.</i>

810
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,668
Scare him off.
Heh. Ha-ha-ha.

811
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:39,141
Papers! Papers!

812
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:42,474
Read all about The Vigilante!

813
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,352
Get your papers here!

814
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,816
Read all about The Vigilante!

815
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,939
How are you this evening, sir?

816
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,655
Papers! Papers!

817
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:55,240
Read all about The Vigilante!

818
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,817
All right, you.
Get your hands up.

819
01:17:13,843 --> 01:17:15,532
Come on. Hands on the car.
Come on.

820
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,136
Spread your legs.

821
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:26,984
Okay. Turn around.

822
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,816
Let's see some identification.

823
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:38,450
- Where do you live?
- 33 Riverside.

824
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,206
Okay, Mr. Kersey. Sorry to have
roughed you up so much.

825
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,618
We're looking for a guy
pretty close to your description.

826
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:48,081
He's supposed to be armed, and we couldn't
take any chances. I hope you understand.

827
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:52,126
Look, if you wanna make a complaint,
I'll give you my number.

828
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,923
It's all right.
Nobody was hurt.

829
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,847
- Okay, thanks. Good night, Mr. Kersey.
- Night.

830
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,389
Okay?

831
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:06,064
Yeah.

832
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:08,229
Okay.

833
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,965
Went in the building
about 10 minutes ago.

834
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,467
Went to D'Agostino's market first.

835
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,153
Let's check him, huh?

836
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,691
Go to that phone booth on
the corner, call his number.

837
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,359
He's up there.

838
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,403
Check him anyway.

839
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,651
- Police! I need the phone.
- Come on!

840
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,404
- Who is this guy?
- He must be crazy.

841
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,614
He said "police."
I didn't see a badge.

842
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,002
I'll call them. I'll call as soon
as he gets off the phone.

843
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:17,085
- Thanks, pal.
- Yeah? Up yours!

844
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:26,382
No answer. He could be
in the shower or something.

845
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,050
Stay here.

846
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:26,487
- Good night, Mr. Kersey.
- Good night.

847
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,602
I'm supposed to meet Paul Kersey.
Has he gone up yet?

848
01:22:57,764 --> 01:23:01,610
Kersey? Yes, sir. He went up and
came down. Just walked out.

849
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:35,098
- Where'd you go?
- He didn't show here, did he?

850
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:36,975
Can I ask a simple question?

851
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:39,398
Is this Paul Kersey the bird?

852
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,943
I ain't gonna ask
any more questions.

853
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:45,275
Go home, will you?
I don't need you.

854
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:46,814
Weird!

855
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:20,473
Come on down, motherfucker.
We gonna take you.

856
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:24,857
That's right, motherfucker,
and you can't go back up, either.

857
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:35,700
Come on down and bring
us the money, honey.

858
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,665
How much money you got, honey?

859
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,048
What the fuck?

860
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,667
Fuck!

861
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:24,877
<i>Units in the 2-6 precinct.</i>

862
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:28,541
<i>A 10-34, 1-2-5 Street
and the West Side Highway.</i>

863
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,495
Hey!

864
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,548
Fill your hand.

865
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:55,256
Huh?

866
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,010
Draw.

867
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:44,260
Where is he, this patrolman?

868
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,031
- You're Reilly?
- Yes, sir.

869
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:03,787
- I'm Ochoa.
- Yes, sir.

870
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,075
- You were the first man on the scene?
- Yes, sir.

871
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:12,372
- God bless you, sir.
- Never mind that.

872
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,629
They told me on the radio
you had to see me?

873
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:18,419
Paul Kersey.

874
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,718
You spoke to him
before the ambulance got here?

875
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:23,014
No, sir.

876
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,763
- What did you get?
- His address, sir.

877
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:28,929
Is that all?

878
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:32,436
Well?

879
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:43,860
You enter this on your report?

880
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,324
Not yet, sir.

881
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:48,539
Why not?

882
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:50,746
I was, uh...

883
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,536
waiting for instructions, sir.

884
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:54,580
You never saw it.

885
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:57,833
Yes, sir.

886
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:03,971
Oh, uh... What's your full name?

887
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,800
Jackson Reilly, sir.
21st precinct.

888
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:10,888
Okay. I'll remember it.

889
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:26,449
Inspector, is it true
that you have The Vigilante in there?

890
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,747
- No.
- Well, who have you got there?

891
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,458
Are you in charge? How is he?

892
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,341
Wounds are clean. Nothing vital.
We have a transfusion going on now.

893
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:41,718
Soon as we get some blood in him,
we'll sew him up again.

894
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:42,924
- Is he in there?
- Yeah.

895
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:45,214
- All right if I go in?
- He won't be able to talk much.

896
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,054
- Can he hear me?
- He is conscious.

897
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,863
Police. I'd like to have him alone.

898
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:19,039
Good evening, Mr. Kersey.

899
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:27,305
This is your gun, Mr. Kersey.

900
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:31,847
We tried to give you a
chance to get rid of it.

901
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:33,349
You wouldn't take it.

902
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:36,727
Do you hear me okay?

903
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:42,071
We have here a peculiar situation,
Mr. Kersey.

904
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:45,480
We find it necessary to
make you a proposition

905
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:48,136
since you are not gonna
favor us by dying.

906
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:53,328
You work for a company
with lots of offices.

907
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:57,001
Get a transfer to another city...

908
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,880
and I'll drop this
gun in the river.

909
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:08,214
Are we connecting, Mr. Kersey?

910
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,559
We want you to get
out of New York.

911
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:15,136
Permanently.

912
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,727
Inspector.

913
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,532
By sundown?

914
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:44,875
- There he is.
- Here he comes.

915
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,630
Do you have The Vigilante, inspector?

916
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:49,463
- Can you give us information?
- No!

917
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,344
Isn't the wounded man
The Vigilante?

918
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,016
No. He's just a mugging victim.

919
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,186
How do you explain the first
reports that he is The Vigilante?

920
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,392
False reports.
It happens all the time.

921
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,598
Then The Vigilante's
still out there?

922
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,767
That's right. He's still
out there on the streets.

923
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:06,025
- Let me through.
- Was he shot by The Vigilante?

924
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:21,165
<i>The Amtrak train from New York to
Chicago has arrived on Track 8.</i>

925
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:24,255
- Mr. Kersey.
- Paul Kersey.

926
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:27,338
Fred Brown. Welcome to Chicago, sir.
Did you have a nice trip?

927
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,626
Yeah, it was okay.

928
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,481
Good. I found a nice
apartment for you.

929
01:32:30,507 --> 01:32:32,448
I hope you like it. It's
on Lake Shore Drive.

930
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:36,139
You have a view of Lake Michigan, morning
sun. We've got your office ready too.

931
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,060
There's a very good
golf club, if you play.

932
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:41,856
- Listen, I think you'll enjoy it here.
- Excuse me.
