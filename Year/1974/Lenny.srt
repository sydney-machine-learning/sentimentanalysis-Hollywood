1
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,846
Oh, I would say, uh...

2
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,560
Let's see, he was busted
at least nine or ten times.

3
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:10,644
Twice for possession of narcotics,
and three, four times for obscenity.

4
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,775
Um...

5
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,313
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Lenny Bruce.</i>

6
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,245
Did you know that Eleanor Roosevelt
gave Lou Gehrig the clap?

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,336
"What'd he say? Jesus, does he
have to get that low for laughs?"

8
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:33,170
"What's the point?
That's really bad taste. "

9
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:38,427
<i>The point... the point is
the suppression of words. Now, dig.</i>

10
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:44,138
<i>Here it is, 1964, and yet every doctor
I know tells me that a certain disease</i>

11
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,103
<i>is on its way to becoming an epidemic
again, when everybody knows</i>

12
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,523
<i>that one shot in the ass'd knock it out.</i>

13
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:54,152
<i>And yet there it is, VD,
right up there with the top ten.</i>

14
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:59,359
<i>Why? Because nobody talks about it.
Nobody even wants to say the word.</i>

15
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,867
<i>If the community chest
hits on you, do you say</i>

16
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:05,118
<i>"Excuse me, how much of my dollar
is going for the clap?"</i>

17
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:09,712
<i>I don't think you do.
What we have to do is talk about it.</i>

18
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,875
<i>What we really need is to get
some of our national heroes</i>

19
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,551
<i>to admit they've had it.</i>

20
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,631
<i>Eleanor Roosevelt
gave Lou Gehrig the clap.</i>

21
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:21,263
<i>She also gave it to
Chiang Kai-shek...</i>

22
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:25,805
<i>And he gave it to J Edgar Hoover,
man... which is how it really spread.</i>

23
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,482
<i>A boy gets the clap. Can he go to his
father? He can't relate to his father.</i>

24
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,690
<i>He's lucky if he can go to a schmuck
who sweeps up the drugstore.</i>

25
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:37,396
<i>- "I gotta talk to you. "
- "What's the matter?"</i>

26
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:40,784
<i>- "I got the clap. "
- "Oh, Jesus, where'd you get that?"</i>

27
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,866
<i>"Painting a car!
What's the difference? I got it. "</i>

28
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:44,995
<i>"What do you want?"</i>

29
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,794
<i>"You work in a drugstore.
Give me some pills. "</i>

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,747
<i>- "Oh, all right. Here. "
- "Dexedrine Spansules. Is this good?"</i>

31
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:57,130
<i>"It's all the same horseshit. Keeps
you awake so you know you got it. "</i>

32
00:02:57,262 --> 00:03:01,474
<i>"The reason I want these pills is I got
a good job. I don't wanna get laid off. "</i>

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,052
<i>- "Yeah? Where you working?"
- "The meat-packing plant. "</i>

34
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:07,595
<i>I'll tell you what we really need.</i>

35
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:10,935
<i>Maybe one day Jerry Lewis
would go on television,</i>

36
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:13,986
<i>and instead of getting hung up
with muscular dystrophy,</i>

37
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:16,189
<i>he'd have a clapathon!</i>

38
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:19,693
<i>Forget it. It'll never happen.
You know why?</i>

39
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:24,204
<i>Because talking about it makes you
the worst person in the community.</i>

40
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,248
<i>When did you first meet Lenny?</i>

41
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:32,204
It was back in 1951. Baltimore.

42
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,417
I was, uh, headlining... Headlining?
I was working at this club.

43
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:40,091
A- one, two, a-one, two, three, four!

44
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:47,728
<i>Now when
the saints go marching in, yeah</i>

45
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:50,892
? Now when the saints
go marching in...

46
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,998
<i>- Yeah!</i>

47
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:11,416
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

48
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:14,750
Here's the moment that
you've all been waiting for.

49
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:19,261
So without further ado,
may we present "Hot" Honey Harlowe!

50
00:04:19,388 --> 00:04:21,843
Let's hear it, everybody!

51
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:03,254
Oh, Eddie.

52
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:05,551
Look at that hair.

53
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:10,887
- Who's the guy over by the window?
- Lenny Bruce. He's a comic.

54
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:18,478
- What kind of comic?
- Lousy.

55
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:23,320
- I think I know her from somewhere.
- Fake hair.

56
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,482
Really?

57
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:45,715
- He's cute.
- Cute? He does crap.

58
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:48,055
Old jokes, lousy impressions.

59
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:52,763
But I really had problems when I was a
kid. It wasn't until I was eight years old

60
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:55,981
that I figured out my name
wasn't "Shut Up. "

61
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:02,857
All right, folks. How about some
bird impressions? Bobwhite.

62
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:08,286
<i>Bobwhite backwards.</i>

63
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,911
A duck.

64
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:13,868
A swallow.

65
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,413
A goose. Ooh!

66
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,920
Did you ever get the feeling that you're
in an amateur contest, and you're losing?

67
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:28,256
All right, folks.
Let's get back to the surefire stuff now.

68
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:32,520
So let's go to the Show Business
Hall of Fame, where the MC

69
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:36,774
is my good friend,
the old Schnozzola himself!

70
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:43,188
It's granite out there.

71
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:53,865
<i>I went into the shoe store</i>

72
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,085
and I said to the clerk
"Do you sell alligator shoes?"

73
00:08:57,213 --> 00:09:01,210
And he said "What size
does your alligator wear?"

74
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:04,011
"You're really something, Durante. "

75
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:09,890
And now, I'd like to introduce ya to
my favourite singer, Vaughn Monroe.

76
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,601
Yeah.

77
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:23,104
<i>Racing with the moon</i>

78
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:29,028
<i>His act was so lousy, something
must have attracted you to him.</i>

79
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:31,320
What was there about him?

80
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:38,995
Well, he was just, um...
I don't know, huggable.

81
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:55,412
Thank you.

82
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:44,209
My mother's a comic,
and I got out of the service

83
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:47,508
and I changed my name, you know.

84
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:51,883
- What's your real name?
- Leonard Alfred Schneider.

85
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:56,759
- Well, why did you change it?
- Too Jewish.

86
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:59,980
<i>I like the name Bruce.</i>

87
00:12:00,107 --> 00:12:03,808
You know, Bruce sounds like
the captain of a football team.

88
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:08,607
That's why I changed it, but the first guy
I met whose name was Bruce

89
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,948
<i>- tried to kiss me.</i>

90
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:14,408
418, please.

91
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:15,949
<i>What hotel are you at?</i>

92
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:19,617
Uh... 621, please.

93
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,994
<i>Here? You're kidding.</i>

94
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,169
No.

95
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,129
- Well?
- Well?

96
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:39,810
<i>- Aren't you gonna answer it?
- Why?</i>

97
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:48,190
How do you people really feel
about "doing it"?

98
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:55,197
Isn't that about the dirtiest thing
we could do to each other?

99
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,165
It's really not nice "doing it".

100
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:01,328
What's the worst thing you can
say to anybody? "Fuck you!"

101
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:05,127
That's really weird, because
if I wanted to hurt you, I should say

102
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,632
<i>"Unfuck you. "</i>

103
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:11,797
Because "fuck you" is really nice, man.

104
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:16,758
"Hello, Ma, it's me. Yeah, I just
got back. Aw, fuck you, Ma!"

105
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:20,515
"Sure I mean it. Is Pop there?"

106
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:25,606
"Aw, Pop, my Pop.
Aw, fuck you, too, Pop!"

107
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:34,400
What?

108
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,742
I can't believe it. I just cannot believe it.

109
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:45,996
- That I'm eating?
- Yeah, that you're eating.

110
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:51,968
No, that you're here. And that
I'm here with you. I can't believe it.

111
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:56,509
Do you know, the first time
I saw you in the cafeteria,

112
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:58,635
I wanted to go up to you and say

113
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,557
"Hi, I'm Lenny Bruce
and I got the hots for you. "

114
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:08,731
- Now, why didn't I do that?
- Now, why didn't you do that?

115
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:13,324
- It would have saved a lot of time.
- It would have saved a lot of time.

116
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:18,409
- I know why I didn't do it.
- Too shy.

117
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,075
Yes. I've always been shy.

118
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,291
- Even as a kid?
- Even as a kid.

119
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:31,630
I tried to get over it,
but I've always been very shy.

120
00:14:31,762 --> 00:14:34,798
I guess when you get right down to it,

121
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:40,054
I'm just... basically...

122
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:45,015
a very shy person.

123
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:51,863
- Ho-ho.
- Don't you have to go to work?

124
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,826
Yes, I do, but I think I should stay here

125
00:14:54,952 --> 00:15:00,326
and try to solve this problem
of extreme shyness.

126
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:05,535
Well, maybe I shouldn't be
telling you some of this, but...

127
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,625
Well, it was quite a week.

128
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:21,968
- Honey?
- Hmm?

129
00:15:23,398 --> 00:15:26,849
Listen, someday I'd like you
to meet my mother.

130
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:32,228
- Did you stay together then?
- No, I had to go to Miami to work.

131
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,691
But, uh, Lenny called every day.

132
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:39,619
And... then one day he called
and said he was coming down

133
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:41,871
cos he couldn't stand to be without me.

134
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,491
We're all the same schmuck!

135
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:50,879
And it just cracks me up that we
try so desperately to be unique

136
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,461
when we're all the same cat -
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson,

137
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:59,258
me, you, every cat has got that one
chick who really busted up his ass!

138
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,188
Wow!

139
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:22,913
I LOVE YOU
THE GUY IN 505

140
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,663
Oh, he's here!

141
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,625
Just a minute.

142
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:42,474
There he stands in his underwear,
pleading like a dummy:

143
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:47,515
"Please, will you touch it once? You
never touch it any more. Just once. "

144
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:51,020
"When I don't feel like it?
When I got a headache?"

145
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:53,989
- "Yeah. "
- "When I don't get any pleasure from it?"

146
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:58,113
"Yeah, that's right. Cos I'm a dummy,
I gotta get it touched. "

147
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:00,736
"If I wait for you, you'd never touch it. "

148
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:02,283
"Oh, I touch it a lot. "

149
00:17:02,415 --> 00:17:07,042
"No, you don't. You think you touch
it a lot. You used to touch it a lot. "

150
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,578
"Now it's a big favour
to get you to touch it. "

151
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:14,341
"It's gotta be like a big holiday,
like Armistice Day, right?"

152
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:16,343
"Well, all right. "

153
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:18,760
"If you're gonna make me feel guilty,

154
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:22,094
bring it over here, I'll touch it. "

155
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:26,889
"No, no, no, don't do me any favours!
I'll just touch it myself. "

156
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:33,897
That's it, man.
We're all the same schmuck.

157
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:38,741
Oh, my God.

158
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:44,075
Oh, man! Is that an album cover!

159
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,704
<i>Why don't you come in,
big boy, and pick a few flowers?</i>

160
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:52,008
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

161
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:56,835
<i>It's a shiksa goddess.</i>

162
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:02,051
That's about the time
I came into the picture.

163
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:05,102
In what capacity?
What was your relationship?

164
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:09,607
Personal manager. Friend.

165
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:13,814
You know... the relationship
between a client and an agent

166
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:18,443
is a very delicate one. Very delicate.

167
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:23,784
You don't know how far to get involved
in their personal lives.

168
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:28,708
Lenny, you name it, she's done it.
I mean, the whole bit.

169
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:31,672
<i>By the time she was 15,
she had already done time.</i>

170
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:34,289
<i>So you can just imagine.</i>

171
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:37,462
Lenny, I'd like to be more
than just an agent to you.

172
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,339
I think you know how I feel.

173
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:43,340
I mean, otherwise I would never
be telling you these things.

174
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:46,597
What did you do, Artie?
Hire a private eye?

175
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,521
<i>I didn't have to.</i>

176
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:54,312
Well, I heard you two were hanging
around a lot together, you know.

177
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:56,355
<i>It was none of my business,</i>

178
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,776
<i>but I just started asking
around about her and...</i>

179
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,615
<i>- I started hearing these things.
- I love you.</i>

180
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:06,578
Well, there was this one guy
who said that he knew her,

181
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:10,789
and he went to a party
with her, and... she, uh...

182
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:14,456
<i>Lenny, look, I don't have
to spell it out for you, do I?</i>

183
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:18,919
Did my mother
have anything to do with this?

184
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:21,724
<i>- Sally? No.</i>

185
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,803
Look, Lenny, I'm not making this stuff up.

186
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:28,269
<i>This isn't a very pleasant thing
to have to do, you know.</i>

187
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:31,233
If you don't believe me,
check it out yourself.

188
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,317
I don't have to, man.
She already told me herself.

189
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:39,235
But, um, thanks.

190
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:45,202
I mean, I got involved in a lot of things
which I wish I didn't get involved in.

191
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:49,625
You know, very painful things
with, you know, his personal life.

192
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:54,545
Since you really cared for him.

193
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:56,881
Yeah, I loved that guy. I really did.

194
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:02,215
- Honey?
- Hm?

195
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:06,726
- Let's get married.
- What?

196
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:10,314
I was a June bride...

197
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,683
And I remember I was wearing
a bengaline suit, had on high heels.

198
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,529
Judge was Judge Liddy.

199
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:22,152
- You remember everything.
- Oh, yeah. A lot of it.

200
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:26,580
They've been sitting down there
like that for 15 minutes.

201
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:31,168
- Why doesn't she let him come up?
- Mema, give her a chance!

202
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:33,086
She's probably a lovely girl.

203
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:35,372
Oh, I knew all about her.

204
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:40,335
And I figured, it's his life, and if that's
who he loves, then that's fine with me.

205
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:43,092
<i>But what can
they be talking about?</i>

206
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:45,300
About us, dummy!

207
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:48,104
Oh, Jesus! There goes the hair.

208
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:52,013
My mother will be on all the time.

209
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,438
She probably won't
even know you're there.

210
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,442
Good, then I won't have to go up.

211
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:58,647
But you gotta meet Aunt Mema.

212
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:01,272
I'll get her to do her famous "Feh" for you.

213
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:02,784
"Feh"? What's that?

214
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:06,493
Her impression of a Jewish seagull.
"Feh! Feh!" You'll see.

215
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:10,667
- Come on, man, let's go.
- Lenny?

216
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:18,754
Do me a favour?
Please don't call me "man".

217
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:22,217
I really wanted her to like me.

218
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:26,177
<i>- In-laws, you know?</i>

219
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:31,766
Oh, now, I gotta tell you
about the first time

220
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:34,436
that this schmuck ever worked a club.

221
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:35,564
Here it comes.

222
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,277
Never been on stage before. I'm
working this club on Ocean Parkway.

223
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:43,071
<i>The Victory Club.
Ugh, what a joint.</i>

224
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,535
The guys were so tough,
they wore wool suits in the summer.

225
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:48,407
<i>With no underwear.</i>

226
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,075
Listen, I know you know the story,
but I'm gonna tell it anyway.

227
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,784
- All right.
- One night the MC didn't show.

228
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:58,125
He had car trouble.
Police found marijuana in the trunk.

229
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,382
- Good.
- You haven't heard that before.

230
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:03,761
How long did you know Leonard
before you two got married?

231
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,680
- Um...
- You're on your own.

232
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,225
Mema... I'm on, OK?

233
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:13,141
So, I'm sitting in the bar.
And in walks Lenny.

234
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:17,106
You should have seen me. I had on
brown suede shoes, and the shirt...

235
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:20,403
So, I says "Lenny,
the MC didn't show tonight. "

236
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:24,576
"Now, how's about if I introduce you,
and you introduce the acts?"

237
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:27,407
And he says "Oh, no.
Are you kidding with that?"

238
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:29,365
And I says "There's nothing to it. '

239
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:34,161
"You don't have to be funny.
It's intros, like 'Here's Slip and Slap'."

240
00:22:34,295 --> 00:22:36,703
"'How about a hand
for Schmutz and Dreck?"'

241
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,509
Dreck is Yiddish for "shit".

242
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,461
- Ouch!
- So he says "OK, why not?"

243
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:44,216
Three seconds later,
I'm in the toilet... bleurgh!

244
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:46,470
- All over the suede shoes.
- Leonard!

245
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,845
- Bleurgh!
- Feh!

246
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:48,972
- Bleurgh!
- Feh!

247
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:52,388
- "Feh". There it is.
- Hold it! Hold it, the star is on!

248
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:56,686
Now, listen, I'm up there, see,
and I got the microphone.

249
00:22:56,818 --> 00:23:00,733
I'm saying "Folks, the MC couldn't
make it tonight, blah, blah, blah. "

250
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:05,491
"But luckily a good friend of mine,
and a funny, funny guy... "

251
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:09,913
Bullshit. You said "the funniest guy in... "
Ouch. "The funniest guy in the world. "

252
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,243
You're right! Right!
"Leonard Alfred Schneider,

253
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:16,793
<i>who just flew in from the coast
for the Sullivan Show,</i>

254
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:18,464
happens to be in the club. "

255
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,209
You dig what she did to me?
My own mother.

256
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:27,137
I'd never been on the stage in my life,
and now I gotta go and try to be funny.

257
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:30,350
You were so nervous
that you came rushing out,

258
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:32,435
and he tripped over the mic cord,

259
00:23:32,563 --> 00:23:35,849
and he knocked us both flat on our asses.

260
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:38,688
<i>It's true.</i>

261
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:43,147
It's true. You never heard
such a laugh - mainly her!

262
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:47,066
So, how long did you two know
each other before you got married?

263
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:49,409
Yes, we must know the answer!

264
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:53,619
How long had we known each other
before we got married?

265
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:57,963
Half an hour. I picked him up on the
D train after he exposed his putz to me.

266
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:00,461
- Terrific!
- "Putz"?

267
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:05,088
I love the "putz"! It's terrific.
It's true. Mema, it's true.

268
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:08,637
I met her on the D train,
and I gave her one of these.

269
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,558
- Feh!
- That's a small "Feh".

270
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:13,472
Would you like to hear a loud "Feh"?
I went up to her...

271
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:16,392
- Feh! Feh!
- That's loud. Can I show Sophie?

272
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:20,107
Sophie! Sophie's her best friend.
Sophie! Mema.

273
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:22,644
Sophie! This is the way I met my wife!

274
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:24,987
Mema doesn't like it. I don't understand.

275
00:24:25,117 --> 00:24:28,782
Mema, you used to...
you used to kiss it when I was little.

276
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:31,830
Oh, Lenny, she's a terrific girl.

277
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:35,043
There's no bigger test
of how hip you really are

278
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:37,494
than when your girlfriend
becomes your wife.

279
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:42,122
Wow. That's a new one. Why?

280
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:46,839
<i>You're walking around
with your jugs and pupik sticking out,</i>

281
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:50,306
and guys are sitting out there
watching you with newspapers

282
00:24:50,434 --> 00:24:52,842
and hats in their laps.

283
00:24:52,978 --> 00:24:55,648
<i>You're jealous!</i>

284
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:58,228
Oh, I like that. I like that.

285
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,736
So I... I thought maybe
we could work something out

286
00:25:02,863 --> 00:25:05,651
that we could do together.

287
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:08,274
- What, a double act?
- Yeah.

288
00:25:08,411 --> 00:25:11,495
Dig what I mean.
Like, you talk to the average guy, man.

289
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:16,249
"Hey, look at that chick over there.
I mean, isn't that a pretty chick?"

290
00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:19,082
"Oh, yeah, she's beautiful. "

291
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:23,045
<i>"She's got a real pretty face,
and nutty jugs. "</i>

292
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:28,586
- "You'd marry a woman like that?"
- "Yeah, are you kidding me?"

293
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:33,765
- "And let your wife dress that way?"
- "No. I'd knock her right on her ass. "

294
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:37,431
"Well, what made you dig her?"

295
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:41,266
"Well, you know,
her jugs were sticking out. "

296
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:45,317
- "She can't dress that way now?"
- "No, you crazy? That's my wife. "

297
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:51,324
Well, I'll have to cancel some of my, uh...

298
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:53,661
Forget it.

299
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:02,963
OK, Daddy. A double act, OK?

300
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:07,338
That's where the conflict starts.
We all want for a wife

301
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:12,714
a combination Sunday school teacher,
and $500-a-night hooker.

302
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,179
Well, he started working
with me to be a singer,

303
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:21,394
and he really played, like,
Flo Ziegfeld or somebody.

304
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:27,197
And we were together 24 hours a day,
so we started working around.

305
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:32,200
Club dates, the Catskills,
and, um, it wasn't a bad act.

306
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,612
Really... not a bad act.

307
00:26:38,794 --> 00:26:42,792
Coming from a big star like you, Mr Hart,
that really means a lot to us.

308
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:46,044
And that's a very pretty
little lady you got there.

309
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:49,674
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.

310
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:52,676
I might even be able to use ya
on my show sometime.

311
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:54,517
Thank you.

312
00:26:54,644 --> 00:26:58,393
Cos I love you, Lenny.
I love you younger guys coming up.

313
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:01,643
You younger guys are what makes
this business a pleasure.

314
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:06,818
Who wants to be a parent with
no children, a king with no princes?

315
00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:11,575
<i>I was talking on the Barry Gray Show
about that. Did you catch it?</i>

316
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:15,286
- She never misses it, Sherman. Right?
- Right.

317
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:17,953
What I'm trying to say, you're so talented.

318
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:21,251
I'd hate to see ya get off on
the wrong foot. Work clean.

319
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,338
Don't resort to using dirt. There was a big
beef about your show the other night.

320
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:29,090
Lucky for you, I ran into Jack Goldstein.

321
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:31,344
I stopped him
from phoning in a bad report.

322
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:35,886
I appreciate that, but it was just
a mistake. It was a comedy of errors.

323
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:40,017
We just finished the duet, and I was
bored doing the same old jokes.

324
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:44,478
It was hot. So, dig. I took off
my jacket, I turned to the band,

325
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:47,185
and I said "Now for my 'jacket off' bit"

326
00:27:47,323 --> 00:27:51,155
And the mic picked it up,
so the band cracked up.

327
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:53,361
- I looked at Honey...
- I cracked up.

328
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:57,659
And then I cracked up. I know it looked
the worst, man, but it was just...

329
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:59,950
That's very stupid.

330
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:02,577
A comic has to use his head.

331
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:06,581
Up there, you gotta be
thinking every second.

332
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,427
Thank you, thank you.

333
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,224
Ladies and gentlemen,

334
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:24,145
one of the all-time greats
of show business is here.

335
00:28:24,277 --> 00:28:27,231
In fact, he got his start
right here in this hotel.

336
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:29,522
Mr Entertainment himself,

337
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:33,406
Sherman Hart, ladies and gentlemen!
Sherman Hart!

338
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,753
You're wonderful.
You're beautiful. Oh, you're heaven!

339
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:49,754
I... Beautiful audience! Oh!

340
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:53,172
Lenny, baby, I just love
what you're doing up there!

341
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:56,142
<i>You'll love it, too,
when you see it on my Comedy Hour.</i>

342
00:28:56,268 --> 00:29:00,100
Wednesday night, CBS.
Thank you. You're beautiful.

343
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,892
I might as well tell you the times.
It's 9.00 Eastern, 7.00 Rocky Mountain,

344
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:07,897
and 4am in Tokyo. Tokyo!

345
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:16,203
Oh, you're beautiful!
Thank you. Thank you.

346
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,157
Lenny, baby, do me a favour.

347
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:22,454
Would you just talk a little slower?
I can't write that fast.

348
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:23,831
Go get 'em. Go get 'em.

349
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:26,536
Sherman Hart, ladies and gentlemen.

350
00:29:26,674 --> 00:29:31,550
You're wonderful! You're super.
Thank you. Go get 'em, kid.

351
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,465
You know, folks, just to digress
for a second, I know that...

352
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:41,263
I'm new at this business and I've got
a lot to learn, but thanks to Sherman,

353
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:46,059
I realise I made a mistake
out here the other night.

354
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:48,649
And if I offended any of you,

355
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,398
I'd really like to apologise.

356
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:55,651
So, by way of making it up to you,

357
00:29:55,787 --> 00:29:57,032
I, uh...

358
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,873
I think I'm gonna piss on you.

359
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:08,671
- Why?
- Look, I just wanna get outta here.

360
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,964
Why would you do such a terrible
thing on the High Holiday weekend?

361
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:15,587
Everybody's going to be
warned about you!

362
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:19,140
You won't work another club, room,
anything! You're finished!

363
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:24,394
- Finished in show business!
- Oh, no, no, no. Not that! Not that!

364
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:29,769
OK, you'll see! You've got
a rough road ahead of you, sonny!

365
00:30:29,905 --> 00:30:33,570
Especially with your dirty mouth
and your no-talent wife!

366
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,502
Come here, Jack.

367
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:48,922
Not one Puerto Rican in your kitchen
hasn't schtupped your wife.

368
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,798
Thanks for everything.
What does he know about talent?

369
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:57,509
OK, what is dirty? And what is clean?

370
00:30:57,642 --> 00:30:59,515
Now, if I had to make a choice, man,

371
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:04,978
I would rather my kid watches
a stag movie than a clean movie,

372
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:06,851
<i>like King of Kings.</i>

373
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:09,855
<i>Why? Because King of Kings
is full of killing,</i>

374
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:13,820
and I don't want my kid to kill Christ
when he comes back.

375
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,777
That's what happens in that.

376
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,659
Tell me about a stag movie where
anybody gets punched or killed.

377
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:22,743
If you're lucky, you might
see someone get tied up

378
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:25,960
or tapped lightly with a Hickok belt,

379
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:30,215
but for the most part, all you really
see during that hour and a half, man,

380
00:31:30,342 --> 00:31:36,462
is a lot of hugging and kissing...
and moaning and groaning...

381
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,975
Oh, God. And then,
near the end of the movie,

382
00:31:40,102 --> 00:31:44,680
when that one potential instrument
of death is revealed...

383
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:47,353
<i>- The pillow.</i>

384
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:51,317
<i>The guy might smother the chick,
like in a horror flick.</i>

385
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:57,532
He takes that pillow and gently
slides it under the girl's ass.

386
00:31:57,661 --> 00:32:01,789
And they go off,
and nobody gets hurt or killed.

387
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:07,040
And it's nice.
And that's the end of the movie.

388
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:31,101
Somebody help!

389
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:34,567
Please, somebody help!

390
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:43,994
Oh, I had cuts all over my arms, my legs.

391
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,663
I had a big gash right across here.

392
00:32:46,795 --> 00:32:50,662
Um, my bladder was punctured.

393
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:54,461
<i>I was in shock for three weeks.</i>

394
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:58,509
It was, uh... it was very dramatic.

395
00:33:02,435 --> 00:33:05,390
Would you like some cold coffee,
Mr Bruce?

396
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:07,064
Thank you.

397
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:15,943
Yes? OK, I will.

398
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:18,032
Mr Bruce? You can go in now.

399
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:32,169
- What is that, Doctor?
- Morphine.

400
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,139
<i>Some people have all the fun.</i>

401
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:49,852
I love you.

402
00:33:56,824 --> 00:33:58,651
Mr Bruce?

403
00:33:59,744 --> 00:34:01,322
Don't leave your coat.

404
00:34:01,454 --> 00:34:04,574
- Oh, thanks.
- Let me help you on with it.

405
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,701
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

406
00:34:25,103 --> 00:34:26,597
Aw, shit.

407
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:32,104
Let's face it, guys are different.
And ladies just don't understand this.

408
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,442
Because to a lady,
cheating means, I know,

409
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:38,906
hugging and kissing
and liking somebody.

410
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:42,403
With guys, that doesn't enter into it.
Guys are detached.

411
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:45,989
You put a guy on a desert island,
he'll do it to mud.

412
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:49,790
A chicken. A barrel. Anything. A knothole.

413
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,328
If you know this,
would you really feel hurt

414
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:57,625
if you came home and found your
husband on the bed with a chicken?

415
00:34:57,761 --> 00:35:00,466
- "A chicken. A chicken in our bed!"
- "Oh, come on. "

416
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:06,268
"Don't touch me! You want your dinner,
get your chicken to get it for you. "

417
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,139
<i>In New York, it's illegal.</i>

418
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:12,685
"Seeming sexual intercourse
with an animal, to wit, a chicken. "

419
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:14,313
That's the literal.

420
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,275
But how can you even fantasise it?

421
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,529
They're too short!

422
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,415
<i>"How come you're alone?
Your chicken leave town?"</i>

423
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:31,333
"Will you leave me alone already?
I was drunk. I met her in the yard. "

424
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,246
"Anyway, I was thinking of you
the whole time I was doing it. "

425
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,636
Do I have to stay in this thing?
I can walk, you know.

426
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,138
It's the rules. Just as far as the door.

427
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,759
You don't wanna break the rules, do you?

428
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,019
Here we go.

429
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,686
OK, take it easy. Easy, easy.

430
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,644
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

431
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,735
Goodbye, Mrs Bruce, Mr Bruce.

432
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,401
- Bye.
- It's been nice meeting you both.

433
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,902
- Thanks for everything.
- Thanks a lot.

434
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:18,625
- You made it with her, didn't you?
- Deny it. Flat-out deny it!

435
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,762
If you really love your wife, deny it.

436
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,716
If they got pictures, deny it.

437
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:28,059
It bugged me at first. You know, it hurt.

438
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:31,052
If they walk in on you, deny it.

439
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:35,318
Say this chick came into the apartment
with a sign around her neck that said

440
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:40,153
"I have malaria. Lie on top of me and
keep me physically active or I'll die. "

441
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:44,150
Later, I found out a lot about
why he did things like that.

442
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:49,708
And chances are, man... they'll
believe it. Do you know why?

443
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,835
- To prove himself.
- Needed to prove himself.

444
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,789
Because they wanna believe it.

445
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,504
- Insecurity?
- Insecurity.

446
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,923
When you got out of hospital,
you had a nice surprise.

447
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,254
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

448
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,178
- You feel OK?
- Oh, a little weak.

449
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,468
- Don't look until I tell you to.
- OK.

450
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,431
Wait.

451
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:13,603
Now.

452
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:16,438
Big black Cadillac.

453
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,901
It's ours.

454
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,442
Where did you get the money? Insurance?

455
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:29,074
$7,000. A few more accidents
like this, and we're set for life.

456
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:32,327
Oh, it's beautiful! It's the most!

457
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,996
I love it. I really love it.
You should have seen the salesman.

458
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:40,627
He said "This car is the same kind Ike
and Dick drive in. " That's what he said.

459
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:43,382
"You take it from Fat Boy.
It's almost new. "

460
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:46,384
"It's only been used once,
and that was in a suicide pact,

461
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:50,135
so there's a little bit of lipstick
around the exhaust pipe. "

462
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,266
I'll take it.

463
00:37:51,397 --> 00:37:54,481
- That's good, young lady.
- Where are we going, Fat Boy?

464
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:59,733
First, Fat Boy's gonna take you to the
motel... where he gonna give it to you

465
00:37:59,864 --> 00:38:04,075
the same way he's been giving it
to the public for 25 years.

466
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,953
- And in the same location, too.
- You promise?

467
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,121
- I promise. Honk-honk.
- Then where are we going, Fat Boy?

468
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:17,209
Then Fat Boy's gonna take you to
that great big used car lot in the sky.

469
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,131
- Know where that is?
- Uh-uh.

470
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:22,509
<i>- California!
- California!</i>

471
00:38:22,637 --> 00:38:25,175
Come on, Fat Boy! Get on!

472
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:28,058
I love you, Lenny.

473
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:32,052
Well, we're off to California.
The new life, you know?

474
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:37,265
We're working our way across the
country playing these dinky clubs.

475
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:41,530
We usually bombed,
but it was kinda fun, you know?

476
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:46,408
- And that's where it all started.
- What?

477
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:49,490
Well, we were working this club in Detroit,

478
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:52,873
and we were all clowning
around in the dressing room,

479
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:56,370
and this drummer comes up and says

480
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:59,126
"Hey, you cats wanna try
something groovy?"

481
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:01,416
And we said "Sure. "

482
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:05,596
So he hands us these little straws,
and we started sniffing this stuff.

483
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:09,506
- Up our noses, you know?
- What was it, cocaine?

484
00:39:09,643 --> 00:39:12,810
No, it was, um, heroin... and stuff.

485
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:19,474
- And how did that make you feel?
- Well... I sort of went bananas...

486
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:22,482
crying, jumping up and down,
stamping all around.

487
00:39:22,615 --> 00:39:23,860
And Lenny?

488
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:28,036
Lenny started laughing.
But it was kind of fun, you know.

489
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:50,098
- Wow.
- Before we're done with this town,

490
00:39:50,226 --> 00:39:54,058
we'll have your jugs in cement
in front of Grauman's Chinese.

491
00:39:54,188 --> 00:39:57,604
We bought pots and pans,
dishes and stuff like that,

492
00:39:57,734 --> 00:40:00,225
and started setting up housekeeping.

493
00:40:01,738 --> 00:40:06,530
It was really terrific for a while, and then...

494
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:11,156
- Want to see a picture I took of Lenny?
- "And then" what?

495
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:14,326
<i>The double act
wasn't getting anywhere.</i>

496
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:19,833
<i>We'd gone through our savings pretty
fast, so I went back to work stripping,</i>

497
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:23,250
<i>and Lenny took whatever jobs he could.</i>

498
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:28,462
<i>We got in with this crowd and...
You know, show people, musicians,</i>

499
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,594
<i>stuff like that.</i>

500
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:33,888
<i>And they were all messing around,</i>

501
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:37,472
<i>fixing, stuff like that.</i>

502
00:41:00,506 --> 00:41:04,718
You do things on dope that normally
wouldn't come into your mind to do.

503
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:11,888
<i>Why not?</i>

504
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,889
<i>I just don't want to, that's all.</i>

505
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:20,188
<i>It'll be nice.</i>

506
00:41:21,986 --> 00:41:26,399
<i>Why do you keep pushing
this, Lenny? You keep pushing.</i>

507
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:30,108
<i>I don't know.</i>

508
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:34,954
A little excitement would be good for us.

509
00:41:38,378 --> 00:41:41,130
<i>I don't think we can handle it.</i>

510
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,664
<i>Well, that's very unhip.</i>

511
00:41:46,052 --> 00:41:48,626
Maybe I'm not hip.

512
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:52,930
Do you love me?

513
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:56,388
Yeah.

514
00:41:56,521 --> 00:42:00,389
Well, don't you know that I love you?

515
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:04,984
Yeah.

516
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,697
So?

517
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:00,198
And now, a word about dykes.
I like dykes.

518
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:04,251
How could you say that?

519
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,540
Lenny, Jesus Christ, you were the one
that talked me into these freak scenes.

520
00:45:09,677 --> 00:45:12,547
I didn't have to do much talking, did I?

521
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,425
Oh, God. I knew it. I knew it.

522
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:22,471
- I told you, but...
- Didn't tell me you'd love it so much.

523
00:45:22,606 --> 00:45:25,014
That's what Will Rogers once said, man.

524
00:45:25,151 --> 00:45:27,642
"I never met a dyke I didn't like. "

525
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:29,237
You're crazy.

526
00:45:29,363 --> 00:45:31,356
You know I made it with that nurse.

527
00:45:31,491 --> 00:45:34,326
- I know it.
- She was terrific.

528
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:35,567
Lenny...

529
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:40,911
- You know I made it with other chicks?
- I don't wanna play this stupid game!

530
00:45:44,379 --> 00:45:48,127
Don't you want to tell me about
the Chinese chick in the club?

531
00:45:48,258 --> 00:45:50,831
You didn't know I knew that, did you?

532
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:58,350
I love you, Lenny.
Why don't you tell me to stop?

533
00:45:58,977 --> 00:46:01,219
Why don't you tell yourself to stop?

534
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:05,810
- Tell me.
- Why? You obviously dig it.

535
00:46:05,942 --> 00:46:09,193
So, you know, that's cool.

536
00:46:12,532 --> 00:46:17,871
You son of a bitch! Why do you
always have to be so fucking hip?

537
00:46:17,996 --> 00:46:21,579
If you notice,
comics will do endless fag jokes,

538
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,496
but never dyke jokes, man.

539
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:29,207
You know why? Because dykes
will really punch the shit out of ya!

540
00:46:43,647 --> 00:46:46,898
It's really hard to spot dykes. Oh, yeah.

541
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:50,893
You know why? Because sometimes,
we're married to 'em.

542
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,619
I love you.

543
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:10,162
You parted several times.

544
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:16,304
What was it that you really
wanted from the marriage?

545
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,842
I wanted a baby. I always wanted a baby.

546
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:26,479
<i>I thought it would help us, you know?
Bring us together.</i>

547
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:29,181
So we both cleaned up for a while,

548
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:33,946
and on November 7th, 1955,
Kitty was born.

549
00:47:34,074 --> 00:47:37,573
We were like a real family for a while.

550
00:47:37,703 --> 00:47:41,747
And then I had to go back to work,
and travel a lot.

551
00:47:41,873 --> 00:47:47,034
And Lenny started MC-ing
these strip joints, real dives.

552
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:51,334
<i>We didn't get to see much
of each other and...</i>

553
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:56,425
I don't know. Sometimes things...

554
00:47:56,555 --> 00:48:01,347
just don't work out and you
really never understand why.

555
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:04,015
Do you want to see
a picture of Kitty as a baby?

556
00:48:12,363 --> 00:48:14,984
<i>No, dummy, in your mouth.</i>

557
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:18,238
- Hey, man, what time is it?
- 9.30.

558
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:21,204
That's right.
Mommy'll be here pretty soon, OK?

559
00:48:58,618 --> 00:49:00,694
Just couldn't get a cab.

560
00:49:01,788 --> 00:49:06,783
<i>Um, called three places</i>

561
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:12,257
and they said they'd send one,
but... Nada City.

562
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:17,213
I finally got one.

563
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,933
Right.

564
00:49:32,695 --> 00:49:37,902
Kitty, Mama's sorry she's late.
She knows Daddy's mad.

565
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:42,327
Mr Bruce? Mr Bruce? Your order ready.

566
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:50,042
- How much?
- $2.75.

567
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:55,050
Where Missis? She's the prettiest
girl I ever see. She sick?

568
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:59,174
Here the fortune cookie, and say
"hello" to her. She a wonderful wife.

569
00:49:59,305 --> 00:50:02,555
- We're divorced.
- You're better off.

570
00:50:02,684 --> 00:50:06,349
It's really hard when you break up
with your old lady.

571
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:11,022
At first you think "That's groovy.
Screw her, I'll really swing, man. "

572
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:15,813
But the kind of chicks you meet when
you're divorced are divorced chicks!

573
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:20,858
They all have that six-year-old kid.
He's like a prop from central casting.

574
00:50:20,994 --> 00:50:24,826
But if they don't have that kid,
they have that French poodle

575
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,625
that has to be allowed
in the bedroom all the time.

576
00:50:28,752 --> 00:50:32,002
In fact, he's on the bed
when you're trying to do it, man.

577
00:50:32,422 --> 00:50:34,581
"What is the function of this dog?"

578
00:50:34,716 --> 00:50:37,468
"He's looking at us.
He just wants to watch. "

579
00:50:37,594 --> 00:50:40,963
"Wants to watch?
I'm not an exhibitionist! I... "

580
00:50:41,682 --> 00:50:43,639
"You get outta here, you pervert. "

581
00:50:45,436 --> 00:50:50,678
The sick red eyes, man.
Tap dancing on the linoleum floor.

582
00:50:50,816 --> 00:50:54,861
I mean... that pink thing
sticking out of him.

583
00:50:54,987 --> 00:50:57,193
It's like a lipstick, right?

584
00:50:57,323 --> 00:51:01,486
No, if you've been married for five
years and it goes into the shithouse,

585
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:04,536
then you're gonna spend
a lot of time throwing up.

586
00:51:04,663 --> 00:51:10,749
And when it's over, about the only
satisfaction you can have is to get even.

587
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:14,378
Get even with that chick, man.
Get that kid. Get even. I got the kid.

588
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:16,879
He just stole her from me.

589
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:23,130
We were in Hawaii, and I had gotten
busted for having a little pot in my car.

590
00:51:23,266 --> 00:51:26,053
I was waiting trial
and he knew I couldn't leave.

591
00:51:26,185 --> 00:51:28,973
And he took her, man, he just took her!

592
00:51:29,105 --> 00:51:33,317
I'm sorry, the tape has run out.
I don't think I got all of that down.

593
00:51:33,443 --> 00:51:38,568
Just give me a second and then...
maybe repeat that for me, please?

594
00:51:38,698 --> 00:51:42,648
No, forget it. I know why.

595
00:51:42,786 --> 00:51:48,028
He took her because he knew
I couldn't take care of her.

596
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:50,206
- Because of drugs?
- Mm-hm.

597
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:54,785
But custody doesn't mean "get even".

598
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:57,496
What custody really means...

599
00:51:57,634 --> 00:52:02,592
<i>is I raise. I get up in the morning.</i>

600
00:52:02,723 --> 00:52:08,346
I schlep the kid. I clean. I love.

601
00:52:09,479 --> 00:52:10,511
It's hot.

602
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:13,640
Phew, man! Custody's a lot of dues.

603
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,774
<i>Is good? You better off with me.</i>

604
00:52:21,742 --> 00:52:25,787
It's probably for you. I'll tell them
you're eating and to call later.

605
00:52:25,913 --> 00:52:30,539
Here. Here, here. Have yourself an orgy.

606
00:52:34,338 --> 00:52:35,334
Yeah?

607
00:52:35,464 --> 00:52:39,083
<i>Collect call for Mr Bruce
from Honey Bruce in Honolulu.</i>

608
00:52:39,218 --> 00:52:42,089
<i>- Is this Mr Bruce?
- Yeah, this is him.</i>

609
00:52:42,221 --> 00:52:46,266
<i>- Will you accept the charges?
- Yeah.</i>

610
00:52:46,392 --> 00:52:50,556
<i>Just a moment.
Go ahead, Mrs Bruce.</i>

611
00:52:52,273 --> 00:52:55,938
<i>- Lenny?
- Hi.</i>

612
00:52:58,571 --> 00:53:02,616
What's shaking, man? What do ya want?

613
00:53:03,493 --> 00:53:05,782
I think you called me.

614
00:53:08,123 --> 00:53:10,162
Oh, right.

615
00:53:13,086 --> 00:53:17,795
Um, what are you doing?

616
00:53:17,924 --> 00:53:20,250
Nothing. It's my night off.

617
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:25,177
Oh, right.

618
00:53:29,561 --> 00:53:33,891
I've got some really good news.

619
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:38,651
I, uh, met this agent who said

620
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:42,611
that maybe he could get me
some dates working conventions.

621
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:48,328
<i>- Yeah, I know. You told me.
- I did?</i>

622
00:53:48,455 --> 00:53:51,575
But he says it's almost definite.

623
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:56,003
He said he'd call on, um, Tuesday.

624
00:54:00,885 --> 00:54:04,883
- Lenny?
- Yeah, that's good, that's good news.

625
00:54:07,224 --> 00:54:11,057
Well, I... got some really good news.

626
00:54:11,187 --> 00:54:16,857
Um... My lawyer says, uh,

627
00:54:16,984 --> 00:54:19,938
I might not have to go to jail.

628
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:22,028
Um...

629
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:26,700
<i>He says we can appeal, but, um...</i>

630
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:28,370
How much this time?

631
00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:32,369
200.

632
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:40,333
Uh, I'll send what I can.

633
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:46,760
I'll pay you back this time.
He said he'd call on...

634
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,723
Tuesday.

635
00:54:57,734 --> 00:54:59,608
I miss you, Daddy.

636
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:08,197
How's Kitty?

637
00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:12,410
<i>- Fine.
- You change her a lot?</i>

638
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:17,456
You know you gotta change her
or else she gets those rashes.

639
00:55:17,588 --> 00:55:20,079
- I gotta hang up now.
- Lenny?

640
00:55:23,511 --> 00:55:25,799
Yeah, I'm still here.

641
00:55:27,556 --> 00:55:29,216
Do you still love me?

642
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:34,387
Sure, but I gotta hang up now. I can't
make these phone bills. It never stops.

643
00:55:34,522 --> 00:55:37,309
I still love you,
and as soon as I'm straight...

644
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:43,112
Look, I gotta hang up.
Uh, listen, I'll send what I can.

645
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:46,189
OK?

646
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:50,787
OK.

647
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:56,914
Take care of yourself.

648
00:56:15,147 --> 00:56:18,979
<i>The trouble is we all live
in a "happy ending" culture.</i>

649
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,893
<i>A "what should be" culture
instead of a "what is" culture.</i>

650
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:26,944
We're taught that fantasy,
but if we were taught "This is what is",

651
00:56:27,075 --> 00:56:30,824
I think we'd be less screwed up.
Dig what I mean.

652
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:35,082
I'd like to show you dirty pictures
that relate to your daughter, or mine.

653
00:56:35,209 --> 00:56:38,791
These are some pictures
of the Kennedy assassination.

654
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:43,132
Now... I say these are dirty pictures,

655
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:45,465
because the captions are bullshit.

656
00:56:45,594 --> 00:56:49,509
"Never for an instant
did she think of flight. "

657
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,760
Now, that's bullshit. That's my conclusion.

658
00:56:52,893 --> 00:56:56,642
<i>Time magazine's conclusion is that
she was trying to get out of the car</i>

659
00:56:56,772 --> 00:57:00,022
to get help or trying to help
the secret service man aboard.

660
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:02,523
That's their conclusion, and we buy it.

661
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:05,571
But I think she did the normal thing, man!

662
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:10,574
When the president and governor got it,
she tried to get the hell out of there!

663
00:57:10,703 --> 00:57:13,159
But they want us to believe this bullshit!

664
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:17,334
They want our daughters, if their
husbands get their faces shot off,

665
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,916
and they try to haul ass
to save their asses,

666
00:57:20,046 --> 00:57:23,629
if they do the normal thing,
then they'll feel guilty and shitty,

667
00:57:23,758 --> 00:57:27,341
because they're not like
that good woman in the fantasy!

668
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:31,385
It's a dirty lie to tell the people
that if you're good, you stay,

669
00:57:31,516 --> 00:57:34,766
and if you're bad, you run,
because she didn't stay!

670
00:57:34,894 --> 00:57:39,188
Fuck it, man, she didn't stay!
People don't stay!

671
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,897
<i>No, people don't stay.</i>

672
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,944
If a Protestant woman's
son's marriage didn't work,

673
00:57:49,076 --> 00:57:51,993
and she picked up and moved
to help raise the child,

674
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,493
would you call her a Protestant mother?

675
00:57:54,623 --> 00:58:00,080
- So you moved to California?
- What else? I'm a Jewish mother.

676
00:58:01,588 --> 00:58:03,213
Lenny went to work at Duffy's?

677
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:07,385
Yeah. Duffy's was a strip joint
about a block and a half from here.

678
00:58:44,924 --> 00:58:49,420
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for
Miss Cindy, tits and ass on the carpet!

679
00:58:49,554 --> 00:58:52,010
Come on, you degenerates,
give her a hand!

680
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,678
Lenny used to do a shtick
between strippers.

681
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:58,889
- What kind of stick?
- No, it's "shtick", darling, "shtick".

682
00:58:59,022 --> 00:59:03,233
I just had a wild idea. You know how
many asses have been on this chair?

683
00:59:03,944 --> 00:59:07,194
Ha-ha! Really, there's been
a lot of asses on this chair.

684
00:59:07,322 --> 00:59:09,730
We have no way of telling how many.

685
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:12,536
But lions and tigers know, right?

686
00:59:12,661 --> 00:59:18,201
That's why when Frank Buck goes
"Ha! Ha!", they go "Eurgh! Eurgh!"

687
00:59:21,753 --> 00:59:25,668
Oh, am I glad that you're here tonight.
All right, you've heard enough

688
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:30,378
of the humorous side of our show.
Let's welcome a great favourite,

689
00:59:30,512 --> 00:59:34,724
Miss Baby Babylon
and her travelling rash.

690
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:41,727
- No! My answer is no!
- Come on, Lenny.

691
00:59:41,857 --> 00:59:45,689
I dig it here because I can say
anything I want! I can do anything.

692
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:49,604
- Nobody's listening!
- What if I could get you $750 a week?

693
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,568
- 750? Get outta here!
- What would they pay him 750 for?

694
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:57,574
- To say anything that's in his head!
- What are those?

695
00:59:57,707 --> 00:59:59,249
- M&M's.
- They dig you.

696
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:02,826
- How do you know?
- They think you're an in thing!

697
01:00:02,962 --> 01:00:06,212
- Lenny an "in thing"?
- Lenny, let me call them!

698
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,001
No mother-in-law jokes?

699
01:00:08,134 --> 01:00:09,877
- No.
- No Max Factor?

700
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:11,422
- Nothing!
- No tuxedos?

701
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:15,219
- You can go on bare-assed if you want.
- Mm-hm... No.

702
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,019
Aw, come on!
Please, Lenny, I need the money!

703
01:00:18,144 --> 01:00:20,220
My final answer is no.

704
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:22,513
- Artie, Lenny's right.
- Yeah.

705
01:00:22,649 --> 01:00:26,860
He's better off here where he can crack up
four musicians at 90 bucks a week.

706
01:00:26,987 --> 01:00:30,854
- Now he should stay here.
- Yeah, she's right. Call 'em.

707
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:33,826
- I don't feel like it.
- Come on, I need the money!

708
01:00:33,952 --> 01:00:37,451
- No, you had your chance.
- Artie, I wanna be a star!

709
01:00:37,581 --> 01:00:39,289
- No.
- Please call 'em!

710
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:41,954
- All right, I'll call them.
- Thanks.

711
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:47,916
Here, sweetheart. I used
to work at a post office.

712
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:55,716
Let's hear it for Miss Baby Babylon
and her bobbling boobies!

713
01:00:55,849 --> 01:01:00,262
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give a nice
welcome to Miss Wanda and her bird.

714
01:01:01,605 --> 01:01:04,143
No, that was last week.

715
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:06,647
You're gonna love this next lovely lady,

716
01:01:06,777 --> 01:01:10,526
so let's welcome her because
she'll thrill you down to your thriller!

717
01:01:10,656 --> 01:01:16,279
Ladies and gentlemen, whatever
her name is, a big hand. Let's hear it.

718
01:01:16,787 --> 01:01:22,126
I bid you all farewell. I'm leaving this toilet
to go on and become a big star. Oh, yeah.

719
01:01:26,214 --> 01:01:32,133
Therefore, pursuant to the power
invested in me by the territory of Hawaii,

720
01:01:32,261 --> 01:01:35,132
I hereby sentence you to be confined

721
01:01:35,264 --> 01:01:40,176
to the Women's Correctional Institution,
Terminal Island, California,

722
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:44,309
for a period of not less than 24 months.

723
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,023
I mean, he stopped doing
that crappy imitation stuff

724
01:01:48,153 --> 01:01:50,726
and he started to improvise.

725
01:01:51,781 --> 01:01:53,821
All right.

726
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:57,162
- Who else can we talk about?
- Eisenhower.

727
01:01:57,996 --> 01:02:01,495
Eisenhower. All right.

728
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:04,829
You students gotta stop
bugging him about the bomb.

729
01:02:04,961 --> 01:02:08,247
He doesn't even know
where they keep the bomb.

730
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:11,214
Actually, it's not a bomb.

731
01:02:12,135 --> 01:02:17,592
It's a button. A button on the fly
of a cub scout somewhere.

732
01:02:17,724 --> 01:02:20,180
One day the whole world
is gonna go up, man,

733
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,386
because of one faggot scoutmaster.

734
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:30,478
I really dig what they do
with homosexuals in this country.

735
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:35,987
They put 'em in prison
with a lot of other men.

736
01:02:36,118 --> 01:02:39,036
That's really good punishment.

737
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,114
Are there any niggers here tonight?

738
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:47,753
Can you turn on the house lights,

739
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,712
and could the waiters and waitresses
just stop serving for a second?

740
01:02:51,842 --> 01:02:53,669
And turn off the spot.

741
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:58,797
Now what did he say?
"Are there any niggers here tonight?"

742
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:02,219
There's one nigger here.
I see him back there working.

743
01:03:02,353 --> 01:03:04,809
Let's see. There's two niggers.

744
01:03:04,939 --> 01:03:08,225
And between those two niggers
sits a kike.

745
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:12,357
And there's another kike.
That's two kikes and three niggers.

746
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:16,438
And there's a spic, right? Hm?

747
01:03:17,535 --> 01:03:18,946
There's another spic.

748
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:21,617
Ooh, there's a wop. There's a Polack.

749
01:03:21,748 --> 01:03:27,039
And then, oh, a couple of greaseballs.
There's three lace-curtain Irish Micks.

750
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,586
And there's one hip, thick,

751
01:03:30,715 --> 01:03:34,001
hunky, funky boogie.

752
01:03:34,886 --> 01:03:37,591
Boogie, boogie. Mm-mm.

753
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:44,811
I got three kikes. Do I hear five kikes?
I got five kikes. Do I hear six spics?

754
01:03:44,938 --> 01:03:49,481
Six spics. Do I hear seven niggers?
I got seven niggers. Sold American!

755
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,852
I'll pass with seven niggers, six spics,

756
01:03:51,987 --> 01:03:54,905
five Micks, four kikes,
three guineas, and one wop.

757
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:57,701
You almost punched me out, didn't ya?

758
01:03:57,826 --> 01:03:59,618
I was trying to make a point,

759
01:03:59,745 --> 01:04:03,363
that it's the suppression of the word
that gives it the power,

760
01:04:03,499 --> 01:04:06,072
the violence, the viciousness.

761
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:10,587
Dig. If President Kennedy would
just go on television and say

762
01:04:10,715 --> 01:04:15,590
"I'd like to introduce you
to all the niggers in my cabinet. "

763
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,420
And if he'd just say "nigger, nigger"
to every nigger he saw,

764
01:04:19,557 --> 01:04:23,258
"Boogie, boogie, boogie,
nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger,"

765
01:04:23,394 --> 01:04:25,470
till it didn't mean anything any more!

766
01:04:25,605 --> 01:04:28,226
Then you'd never be able
to make a black kid cry

767
01:04:28,358 --> 01:04:31,228
because somebody called him
a nigger in school.

768
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:40,953
I am of Semitic background. I'm Jewish.

769
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:44,412
Now, a Jew, dictionary-style,
is one who is descended

770
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:46,414
from one of the tribes of Judea

771
01:04:46,543 --> 01:04:49,294
or one who is regarded
to have descended from them.

772
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:54,047
But you and I know what a Jew really is:

773
01:04:54,175 --> 01:04:57,924
One who killed our Lord!

774
01:04:58,054 --> 01:05:01,388
I don't know if it got much
press coverage here on the West Coast

775
01:05:01,516 --> 01:05:03,176
cos it was 2,000 years ago.

776
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:07,557
Although there should be a statute of
limitations, we're still paying the dues.

777
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:11,433
Why do you keep busting
our balls for this crime?!

778
01:05:11,568 --> 01:05:16,029
"Why? Because you skirt the issue.
You blame it on Roman soldiers. "

779
01:05:16,156 --> 01:05:19,193
I'm gonna clear the air once
and for all, and confess.

780
01:05:19,326 --> 01:05:23,110
We did it. My family, I did it.

781
01:05:23,247 --> 01:05:27,031
We found a note in the basement:
"We killed him", signed Morty.

782
01:05:28,502 --> 01:05:30,709
Good thing we nailed him when we did,

783
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:34,586
because if we had done it within
the last 50 years, we'd have to contend

784
01:05:34,717 --> 01:05:36,959
with generations
of parochial schoolkids

785
01:05:37,094 --> 01:05:40,428
with little electric chairs
hanging around their necks.

786
01:05:42,558 --> 01:05:45,263
<i>- 1,000 a week?
- Yeah. That's right.</i>

787
01:05:45,394 --> 01:05:48,479
No. No, no. We want 13...

788
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:52,733
<i>- Uh... 1500 a week minimum...
- 15?!</i>

789
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:57,238
<i>- .. guaranteed against a percentage.
- Percentage? What percentage?</i>

790
01:05:57,365 --> 01:05:59,404
<i>- What percentage?
- Yeah.</i>

791
01:06:00,994 --> 01:06:03,745
<i>- Uh, 20 per cent?</i>

792
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:06,826
<i>Get outta here!
The guy's a fad, like Hula-Hoops.</i>

793
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:09,116
Oh, I'm a fucking fad? 30!

794
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:15,591
Look, uh... did I say 20 per cent?
I really meant to say 30 per cent.

795
01:06:15,717 --> 01:06:19,216
<i>30 per cent? I never paid an actor
30 per cent in my life.</i>

796
01:06:19,346 --> 01:06:23,758
Well, you know Lenny. He's, uh... crazy.

797
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:26,430
<i>Crazy? Are you guys trying to screw me?</i>

798
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:28,887
<i>- Yes.
- How crazy can he be?</i>

799
01:06:29,022 --> 01:06:31,145
You pay me what I want
or I don't show up.

800
01:06:31,274 --> 01:06:34,644
<i>- Who is that?
- Pay Lenny or he don't go to work...</i>

801
01:06:38,365 --> 01:06:41,485
<i>- What's going on there?
- Look, I'll call you back.</i>

802
01:06:44,204 --> 01:06:47,371
No, man, it's a lot of bullshit, man,
I'm just a comic.

803
01:06:47,499 --> 01:06:49,243
Yeah, but for a nightclub comic,

804
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:52,081
you certainly have a great deal
of social impact.

805
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:55,048
No. Come on, man.

806
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:57,376
True. And people say you feel

807
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:01,590
a certain obligation to speak out
on subjects that would not normally...

808
01:07:01,722 --> 01:07:06,100
No, no, no. That's not it at all.
I'm just trying to make a buck.

809
01:07:06,227 --> 01:07:08,634
Oh, that's nice.

810
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:12,264
- You want some yoghurt?
- No, thank you.

811
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,650
- It's good for you. It's healthy.
- Well, that's good.

812
01:07:15,778 --> 01:07:20,440
I really dig being up there. It's like I want
to recite a poem in front of everybody.

813
01:07:20,575 --> 01:07:23,576
It's like you stand up
and everybody listens to you.

814
01:07:23,703 --> 01:07:27,950
Your mother, your father.
They finally listen to you, man.

815
01:07:28,082 --> 01:07:30,620
And they don't chase you outta the room.

816
01:07:30,752 --> 01:07:33,159
<i>- Yeah, come in.</i>

817
01:07:33,296 --> 01:07:36,795
Hi. Oh, this is Artie Silver,
my manager.

818
01:07:36,925 --> 01:07:39,546
This is... Sorry, I forgot your name again.

819
01:07:41,346 --> 01:07:46,304
<i>- John Santi.
- Mr Santi writes for Time magazine.</i>

820
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:50,143
- Oh. Very good.
- Uh-huh.

821
01:07:53,191 --> 01:07:56,477
Well, usually I don't like doing interviews,

822
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:59,648
but... I find you very interesting.

823
01:07:59,781 --> 01:08:02,985
"Sick comic Lenny Bruce

824
01:08:03,118 --> 01:08:07,745
whose jokes about the President... "
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

825
01:08:07,873 --> 01:08:10,031
You know what's sick?

826
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:14,959
Zsa Zsa Gabor will get $60,000 a week

827
01:08:15,089 --> 01:08:17,580
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

828
01:08:17,716 --> 01:08:23,090
And schoolteacher salaries in that
state, top salary is $6,000 a year.

829
01:08:23,222 --> 01:08:24,681
Now, that's really sick!

830
01:08:24,807 --> 01:08:28,805
And that's the kind of "sick"
I wish they would have written about.

831
01:08:31,564 --> 01:08:35,893
Or the fact that married guys have
to jack off more than anybody else!

832
01:08:36,027 --> 01:08:37,437
It's true, and it's weird.

833
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:42,565
All over the country, thousands
of guys are lying on bathroom floors

834
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,527
whacking it off to Miss December!

835
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,282
Because the wife don't
want to touch it any more.

836
01:08:47,413 --> 01:08:51,541
You can't stop masturbating gradually.
You got to do it cold jerky.

837
01:08:51,668 --> 01:08:53,660
<i>What's Time gonna say about that?</i>

838
01:08:53,795 --> 01:08:56,961
All right, how about
some more sick material, huh?

839
01:08:59,008 --> 01:09:01,167
Integration.

840
01:09:05,932 --> 01:09:10,808
Actually, I do have some guilt that
I don't do enough for integration.

841
01:09:10,937 --> 01:09:13,808
I try to do my bit,

842
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,559
but it just doesn't seem to be enough.

843
01:09:17,694 --> 01:09:20,446
They asked me to make
the marches, but I couldn't,

844
01:09:20,572 --> 01:09:22,730
because it's always the same old crap.

845
01:09:22,866 --> 01:09:26,200
Ray Charles bumping into
Stevie Wonder all day long.

846
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,901
I mean, it's the worst!

847
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:34,415
No. You don't have to applaud!
Really, it's really weird.

848
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,249
It's enough that you're listening.
It's strange.

849
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:42,007
I used to get fired for doing this, and,
like, now I'm getting a following, right?

850
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:47,426
Oh, come on.

851
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,385
Oh, it's embarrassing!

852
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,354
Just stop it.

853
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:58,894
Come on. I'm walking off here
if you don't stop right now!

854
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,815
I don't want any more applause.
No more love.

855
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,987
Why aren't you two standing?

856
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,323
Thanks.

857
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:11,956
You know, I been thinking.
I mean, I am totally corrupt.

858
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:17,326
I mean, really. My whole act. My whole
economic success, whatever that is,

859
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:21,924
is based solely on the existence
of segregation, violence,

860
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,218
despair, disease and injustice.

861
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:31,219
<i>And if, by some miracle, the whole
world were suddenly tranquil, pure,</i>

862
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,270
<i>I'd be standing on
an unemployment line somewhere.</i>

863
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,224
So you see, I'm not a moralist.

864
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:40,521
If I were, I'd be donating my salary
to those schoolteachers. Right?

865
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:44,023
I'm a hustler.
As long as they give, I'll grab.

866
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:49,994
<i>While that was happening,
you were in prison?</i>

867
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:53,538
<i>- Yeah.
- Did he visit you?</i>

868
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:57,202
<i>Whenever he could.
And we wrote each other a lot.</i>

869
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:01,504
- What kind of letters?
- Oh, here, I kept some of 'em.

870
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:05,546
Shit. They're here somewhere.

871
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:11,136
<i>Anyway, they were about, um...
how sorry we both were.</i>

872
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:15,847
I don't know, I guess I just
never thought of us as being divorced.

873
01:11:18,526 --> 01:11:21,443
Oh, wow!

874
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:25,402
Oh. I got some terrific pictures of Kitty.

875
01:11:25,533 --> 01:11:27,276
- Are you ready?
- Uh-huh.

876
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,153
You'll be surprised.

877
01:11:29,287 --> 01:11:33,498
Oh... Go on.

878
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:35,783
She's getting so big, huh?

879
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:41,503
- Kitty on pony.
- Oh, that's cute.

880
01:11:41,632 --> 01:11:44,503
Kitty with stuffed lion and friends.

881
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:46,628
Who's the chick?

882
01:11:46,763 --> 01:11:49,680
A friend of Artie's.

883
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:54,683
- Do you believe that?
- No, but thanks for trying.

884
01:11:57,315 --> 01:12:00,649
Hey, listen.
I got cited for meritorious behaviour,

885
01:12:00,777 --> 01:12:04,989
and that means that if I'm good
I get 67 days knocked off my time.

886
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:13,742
- Can I see the album again?
- Yeah.

887
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,209
It must be wonderful to be, like, a star.

888
01:12:28,263 --> 01:12:31,348
Something's bothering me
and I wanna talk about it.

889
01:12:31,475 --> 01:12:33,717
Did you read about the, uh... Thanks.

890
01:12:33,852 --> 01:12:37,138
.. the two schoolteachers who
were busted for homosexuality?

891
01:12:37,272 --> 01:12:40,772
Right. This is an editorial
from this morning's newspaper

892
01:12:40,901 --> 01:12:44,899
and I'm quoting directly from it.
I'll just read the last sentence:

893
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:51,151
"And let us make certain
that these sexual deviates

894
01:12:51,287 --> 01:12:54,703
are never allowed
inside a classroom again. "

895
01:12:54,832 --> 01:12:58,415
That's wrong. First, they were
busted for what they were doing

896
01:12:58,544 --> 01:13:00,703
15 miles away from the school.

897
01:13:00,838 --> 01:13:03,875
What's more important
is what came out at the trial

898
01:13:04,008 --> 01:13:05,668
is that they're good teachers.

899
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:09,218
And do you know how long it takes
to make a good teacher?

900
01:13:09,347 --> 01:13:11,174
I'll tell you something else.

901
01:13:11,307 --> 01:13:14,890
There wasn't one incident reported
where a kid came home and said

902
01:13:15,019 --> 01:13:18,602
"We had five minutes of geography,
10 minutes of cocksucking. "

903
01:13:25,822 --> 01:13:27,862
Man, what is that?

904
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:30,826
And that's what happened the first time.

905
01:13:30,952 --> 01:13:34,997
Dirty Lenny said a dirty word,
and they schlepped him away for it.

906
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:38,539
What makes you think you've got
the right to say a word like that?

907
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:41,456
What word is that? I said a lot of words.

908
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:45,123
You know what word I'm talkin' about.
It's against the law.

909
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:47,749
I didn't do it, man, I just said it.

910
01:13:47,886 --> 01:13:52,299
Yeah. If you ever said it
in front of my wife or kid,

911
01:13:52,432 --> 01:13:54,805
I'd punch you right out.

912
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:59,350
I really don't want to get involved in this.

913
01:14:06,155 --> 01:14:08,444
Empty your pockets.

914
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:29,803
At first, I think he really enjoyed it.
You know, he got a lot of publicity.

915
01:14:29,929 --> 01:14:31,922
I don't know if he enjoyed it or not.

916
01:14:32,056 --> 01:14:37,217
Enjoyed it? Hell, no.
He was obsessed with it.

917
01:14:37,353 --> 01:14:42,062
<i>Toward the end, he wouldn't do any bits,
he wouldn't do any jokes.</i>

918
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:46,106
<i>All he wanted to do was read
from the transcripts of his trials.</i>

919
01:14:46,237 --> 01:14:49,191
My first trial was in front
of a judge, no jury.

920
01:14:49,324 --> 01:14:53,322
The judge was distinguished-looking.
He looked like a movie judge.

921
01:14:53,453 --> 01:14:57,237
<i>Like Andy Hardy's father.
So I said "That's cool. He'll be fair. "</i>

922
01:14:57,374 --> 01:15:01,122
Your Honour, if I might interject,
even if there were minors present,

923
01:15:01,253 --> 01:15:05,001
I don't think that I said anything
that would have done them any harm.

924
01:15:08,176 --> 01:15:12,506
Young man, I think you'd better
let your attorney try this case.

925
01:15:12,973 --> 01:15:17,434
Now, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm ready to find you guilty right now.

926
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:22,395
However, I will grant a continuance
as you have requested.

927
01:15:22,524 --> 01:15:23,603
Thank you, sir.

928
01:15:23,734 --> 01:15:28,526
Now it's my understanding
that he has a performance on, uh...

929
01:15:29,156 --> 01:15:30,864
- Saturday.
- .. Saturday.

930
01:15:30,991 --> 01:15:32,236
Yes, sir.

931
01:15:32,368 --> 01:15:34,906
I want to caution you
right now, young man,

932
01:15:35,037 --> 01:15:38,904
that if I get a report that you have
repeated any of this language,

933
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:42,244
any of these words,
you'll take the consequences.

934
01:15:42,378 --> 01:15:46,423
- Is that clear?
- If I repeat what words? It's all right.

935
01:15:46,549 --> 01:15:50,381
If I repeat what words
specifically, Your Honour?

936
01:15:50,511 --> 01:15:54,343
You say anything obscene,
and I'll take that into consideration

937
01:15:54,473 --> 01:15:57,261
when I dispose of the case.
Court adjourned.

938
01:16:25,422 --> 01:16:26,750
Thank you very much.

939
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:29,633
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Lenny Bruce!

940
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:47,359
Thank you. Bless you. Bless you.

941
01:16:48,362 --> 01:16:50,105
That's because you're good.

942
01:16:51,698 --> 01:16:55,613
Wow. Look at that. We seem
to have some company here tonight.

943
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:59,113
Could you throw the spotlight
against the wine chest?

944
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:02,699
I'd like to welcome some friends.
I think they're here.

945
01:17:02,835 --> 01:17:06,500
Ah, yes, there they are.
Good evening, fellas. Hi, guys.

946
01:17:07,715 --> 01:17:10,206
It's Mount Rushmore.

947
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:14,387
Could we throw the spot on the
other wall there? I think I spot two.

948
01:17:14,513 --> 01:17:18,511
I'm not sure. Ah, yes, there they are!

949
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:21,762
Hi, Mickey. How's the family? OK.

950
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:27,936
Wow. Have you ever seen
so much blue in all your life?

951
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:32,443
I seem to be under a little pressure
here tonight to cool my act.

952
01:17:32,573 --> 01:17:36,025
I don't know how many of you know,
but I was arrested, busted,

953
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,953
right here on this stage
a few nights ago, for saying... No.

954
01:17:41,082 --> 01:17:42,874
I'm not gonna say it.

955
01:17:43,001 --> 01:17:48,624
Let's see. It's an 11-letter word,
it starts with a "C" and ends with a "G".

956
01:17:48,757 --> 01:17:52,256
And it was used... it was used
in the context of defending

957
01:17:52,385 --> 01:17:54,342
a certain homosexual practice.

958
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:59,014
Actually, though, I don't relate it
only to homosexuals...

959
01:18:00,435 --> 01:18:05,097
I relate it to any contemporary
woman I know! Oh, yeah.

960
01:18:05,232 --> 01:18:06,774
Would know or love or marry.

961
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,521
- You do, too, if you're honest, right?
- Right!

962
01:18:09,653 --> 01:18:12,607
OK, I'd like to ask you all
a few questions now, OK?

963
01:18:12,739 --> 01:18:16,784
And you're all under oath, all of you.
Even standing room only.

964
01:18:20,205 --> 01:18:26,041
How many people in this club here
tonight have ever used that word...

965
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:28,162
blah-blah-blah?

966
01:18:28,297 --> 01:18:32,129
Don't be shy, you can raise
your hands. Well, that's cool.

967
01:18:32,259 --> 01:18:38,262
Now let's get really honest. You, sir,
have you ever had your blah blahed?

968
01:18:39,433 --> 01:18:43,597
Hm? It's either yes or no.
There's no two ways about it!

969
01:18:43,729 --> 01:18:48,142
OK, how many men in this room
have ever had their blah blahed?

970
01:18:49,235 --> 01:18:51,274
Raise your hands.

971
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:55,947
Oh, come on, officers.
Now you're under oath.

972
01:18:56,075 --> 01:18:59,658
All right, keep your hands raised.
How many men in this room

973
01:18:59,787 --> 01:19:05,742
have ever blahed a blah? Phew, man.
Somebody's not telling the truth.

974
01:19:05,877 --> 01:19:09,827
OK, ma'am, tell me,
have you ever blahed a blah?

975
01:19:10,465 --> 01:19:14,961
The officers couldn't see it, but she
went like this, and he went like this.

976
01:19:15,095 --> 01:19:18,927
This time the whole audience
gets schlepped away, right?

977
01:19:21,726 --> 01:19:24,763
This is the dirtiest show
I've ever done in my life!

978
01:19:26,106 --> 01:19:27,683
This is really filth!

979
01:19:29,526 --> 01:19:33,773
Now if there is anyone who has not
found this obscene, you're full of blah,

980
01:19:33,905 --> 01:19:37,654
and I hope you never get your
blah blahed again! That's my show.

981
01:19:37,784 --> 01:19:40,572
Thank you and good night!

982
01:19:47,044 --> 01:19:49,416
Andy Hardy's father found me guilty.

983
01:19:49,546 --> 01:19:52,713
One year in jail, and $1,000 fine.

984
01:19:52,841 --> 01:19:57,005
<i>Phew. So you know what we did?
We made a motion for a trial de novo.</i>

985
01:19:57,137 --> 01:20:01,384
We wanted a jury trial, figuring that
12 average members of the community

986
01:20:01,517 --> 01:20:05,515
could better determine what was
obscene, as opposed to one judge.

987
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:09,640
Here is a guy that never
got past the ninth grade.

988
01:20:09,775 --> 01:20:13,310
At the age of 36, he turns around,
he decides to become a lawyer.

989
01:20:13,446 --> 01:20:16,779
<i>And, I mean,
he drove his friends nuts with it.</i>

990
01:20:16,908 --> 01:20:22,329
<i>Collecting old law books, case numbers,
newspaper clippings, you name it.</i>

991
01:20:22,455 --> 01:20:25,824
And tape. He started taping everything!

992
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:30,122
<i>He spent $63,000 for tape recordings,</i>

993
01:20:30,255 --> 01:20:32,461
<i>tape equipment, engineers.</i>

994
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,377
<i>He even hired a guy
to record his own trials!</i>

995
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:39,721
Officer Ryan, were you sexually
stimulated by Mr Bruce's performance?

996
01:20:39,848 --> 01:20:42,802
Irrelevant and immaterial, Your Honour.

997
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:45,342
- Overruled.
- No, sir.

998
01:20:45,478 --> 01:20:50,224
Officer Ryan, have you ever used
the word "cocksucker"?

999
01:20:50,358 --> 01:20:52,232
Not to my knowledge.

1000
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:56,061
You are quite familiar with the term
"cocksucker", are you not?

1001
01:20:56,198 --> 01:20:57,360
I've heard it used.

1002
01:20:57,491 --> 01:21:00,907
Matter of fact, the word "cocksucker"
is frequently heard

1003
01:21:01,036 --> 01:21:02,863
in a police station, is it not?

1004
01:21:02,996 --> 01:21:05,404
Irrelevant and not germane to the issue.

1005
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:10,001
The objection is overruled.
You may answer, Officer.

1006
01:21:10,128 --> 01:21:13,829
<i>Could I have
the question again, please?</i>

1007
01:21:15,968 --> 01:21:19,384
"Matter of fact, the word 'cocksucker'
is frequently heard

1008
01:21:19,513 --> 01:21:21,589
in a police station, is it not?"

1009
01:21:23,267 --> 01:21:26,850
<i>I have heard it used, yes.</i>

1010
01:21:26,979 --> 01:21:30,929
Yes, you have heard
the word "cocksucker"

1011
01:21:31,066 --> 01:21:34,151
used in a police station,
which is a public place.

1012
01:21:34,987 --> 01:21:37,657
I think you're all getting off on that word.

1013
01:21:37,782 --> 01:21:41,779
You see, Lenny Bruce's satire
is related to the kind of social satire

1014
01:21:41,911 --> 01:21:44,947
found in the works
of Aristophanes, Jonathan Swift...

1015
01:21:45,081 --> 01:21:48,580
Your Honour, Aristophanes
is not testifying here.

1016
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:51,497
I don't see how he really could.

1017
01:21:57,093 --> 01:22:00,379
Reverend Mooney, could you give
the jury a brief summary

1018
01:22:00,513 --> 01:22:03,514
of your background in the
field of higher education?

1019
01:22:03,641 --> 01:22:09,347
Yes. I have been a Professor of Theology
for almost 12 years now.

1020
01:22:09,481 --> 01:22:12,565
Could you speak a little louder, sir?

1021
01:22:12,692 --> 01:22:13,890
Yes.

1022
01:22:14,027 --> 01:22:19,152
I've taught at Boston University
for three years,

1023
01:22:19,282 --> 01:22:22,200
Northwestern University for two years,

1024
01:22:22,327 --> 01:22:24,533
then UCLA for three years more,

1025
01:22:24,663 --> 01:22:27,201
and I am now at Berkeley.

1026
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,372
This poor schmuck can't hold a job.

1027
01:22:30,502 --> 01:22:34,963
Reverend Mooney, how would
you characterise Mr Bruce's work?

1028
01:22:35,757 --> 01:22:39,921
Well, I think that Lenny
has a message to convey.

1029
01:22:40,053 --> 01:22:44,762
Now it's my turn. Would you speak
a little louder, please, Reverend?

1030
01:22:44,892 --> 01:22:49,103
Yes. He has a message to convey.

1031
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:51,471
And he is honest and sincere about it.

1032
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:53,765
The message is, I believe,

1033
01:22:53,901 --> 01:22:57,946
to expose and hold up American society,

1034
01:22:58,072 --> 01:23:00,777
so they can really see themselves.

1035
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:03,197
Your Honour, I cannot hear the witness.

1036
01:23:03,327 --> 01:23:06,198
<i>- Reverend.
- I'm sorry.</i>

1037
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:13,169
He uses words as weapons,
to hit people over the head with.

1038
01:23:13,296 --> 01:23:16,332
To make them recognise
they are being hypocritical

1039
01:23:16,466 --> 01:23:19,835
in every phase of their lives.

1040
01:23:19,969 --> 01:23:24,927
Words are his tools, and he uses them
like a carpenter uses a hammer...

1041
01:23:25,058 --> 01:23:28,557
<i>Order. Order. Order.
Spectators will be seated.</i>

1042
01:23:28,686 --> 01:23:31,356
Order in the court. Mr Bruce!

1043
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:33,972
What was the nature of this "chant"?

1044
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,563
Well, it was supposed to be talk
between a man and a woman,

1045
01:23:38,697 --> 01:23:42,315
who were... involved in the...

1046
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:45,024
in the act of copulation.

1047
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:50,791
<i>"To" is a preposition. "Come" is a verb.</i>

1048
01:23:50,917 --> 01:23:55,414
<i>"To" is a preposition. "Come"
is a verb. The verb intransitive.</i>

1049
01:23:55,547 --> 01:23:59,415
<i>"To come. " I've heard these
two words my whole adult life,</i>

1050
01:23:59,551 --> 01:24:01,959
<i>and as a kid when they
thought I was sleeping.</i>

1051
01:24:02,095 --> 01:24:06,093
<i>It's been like a big drum solo.
"Did you come? Did you come good?"</i>

1052
01:24:06,225 --> 01:24:09,226
<i>"Did you come good?
Did you come good?"</i>

1053
01:24:09,436 --> 01:24:12,223
<i>"Did you come good?
Did you come good?"</i>

1054
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:14,515
<i>"Did you come good?
Did you come good?"</i>

1055
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:15,848
<i>"Did you come good?"</i>

1056
01:24:15,985 --> 01:24:20,196
<i>"I come better with you, sweetheart,
than anyone in the whole damn world. "</i>

1057
01:24:21,949 --> 01:24:27,192
<i>"But don't
come in me. Don't come in me. "</i>

1058
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:30,699
<i>"Don't come in me mimme mimme,
don't come in me mimme mimme,</i>

1059
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,660
<i>don't come in me. "</i>

1060
01:24:32,793 --> 01:24:36,245
<i>"I can't come. Don't ask me!"</i>

1061
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:39,465
<i>"You don't love me,
that's why you can't come. "</i>

1062
01:24:39,592 --> 01:24:44,634
<i>"I love ya, I just can't come, that's my
hang-up. I can't come when I'm loaded. "</i>

1063
01:24:44,764 --> 01:24:47,337
<i>- "Cos you don't love me. "
- "What is the matter?"</i>

1064
01:24:47,475 --> 01:24:51,888
<i>"What has that got to do with loving
you? I just can't come, that's all. "</i>

1065
01:24:52,021 --> 01:24:55,390
<i>Now, if anyone in this room,
or the world,</i>

1066
01:24:55,525 --> 01:25:00,732
<i>finds those two words
obscene, indecent, immoral,</i>

1067
01:25:00,864 --> 01:25:02,940
<i>you probably can't come.</i>

1068
01:25:05,076 --> 01:25:08,908
Mr Bruce, you are smiling.
This is not for your entertainment.

1069
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:11,577
I don't know if what I've heard
is legally obscene...

1070
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:14,662
- Your Honour, do you believe in God?
- Bailiff?

1071
01:25:14,794 --> 01:25:16,668
A God that made your body.

1072
01:25:16,797 --> 01:25:19,370
If you believe there is a God
that made your body,

1073
01:25:19,508 --> 01:25:24,217
then why do you keep telling children
to cover up, that the body is dirty?

1074
01:25:24,346 --> 01:25:25,377
God, what a bore.

1075
01:25:25,514 --> 01:25:29,097
If the body is dirty, then the fault
lies with the manufacturer.

1076
01:25:29,226 --> 01:25:31,931
That means you gotta schlep
God into court with me.

1077
01:25:32,062 --> 01:25:35,514
The defendant is charged
with violating section 311.6

1078
01:25:35,649 --> 01:25:38,520
of the California penal code
which provides:

1079
01:25:38,652 --> 01:25:41,819
"Any person who knowingly
speaks any obscene song, ballad

1080
01:25:41,947 --> 01:25:46,241
or other words in a public place
is guilty of a misdemeanour".

1081
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:49,535
Now, "obscene" means
to the average person,

1082
01:25:49,663 --> 01:25:52,914
applying contemporary
standards of the community.

1083
01:25:53,042 --> 01:25:57,336
The dominant appeal of the matter
being to arouse a prurient interest,

1084
01:25:57,463 --> 01:26:02,754
which is a morbid or shameful interest
in nudity or sex or excretion,

1085
01:26:02,885 --> 01:26:05,672
which goes beyond the limits
of such matters.

1086
01:26:05,805 --> 01:26:07,797
Uh-oh.

1087
01:26:07,932 --> 01:26:10,008
.. redeeming social importance.

1088
01:26:10,143 --> 01:26:14,271
Now, sex and obscenity
are not synonymous.

1089
01:26:14,397 --> 01:26:17,932
To make sex obscene,
it is necessary that the portrayal of it

1090
01:26:18,067 --> 01:26:21,650
must be done in such a way
that its dominant tendency

1091
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:27,984
is to corrupt the average adult,
by creating a clear and present danger

1092
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:29,744
of antisocial behaviour.

1093
01:26:29,871 --> 01:26:33,370
In other words,
some cat'll see my show, get horny,

1094
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,370
run off to a museum,
and jerk off a dinosaur!

1095
01:26:36,503 --> 01:26:39,290
"We, the jury, find
the defendant not guilty

1096
01:26:39,422 --> 01:26:43,634
of violation of Section 311.6 of the
penal code of the state of California,

1097
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,671
to wit, 'speaking or singing obscene
words or ballads in a public place'."

1098
01:26:50,684 --> 01:26:54,349
<i>You'd mentioned you'd get
six months off that jail sentence.</i>

1099
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:55,594
<i>Did that happen?</i>

1100
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:59,266
<i>No, I got in some trouble,
so I had to serve my full time.</i>

1101
01:26:59,401 --> 01:27:01,394
What kind of trouble?

1102
01:27:01,528 --> 01:27:06,867
- Well, I just did something crazy.
- You don't want to tell me about it?

1103
01:27:06,992 --> 01:27:08,736
No.

1104
01:27:08,869 --> 01:27:11,656
<i>All right. Anyway, you did get out.</i>

1105
01:27:11,789 --> 01:27:16,367
<i>Yeah. They give you a lot
of speeches about rehabilitation,</i>

1106
01:27:16,502 --> 01:27:21,378
<i>they lay a little bread on you,
they try to help you, and then...</i>

1107
01:27:21,507 --> 01:27:24,176
- Good luck, dear.
- Oh. Thank you.

1108
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:26,093
.. they drop you on the sidewalk.

1109
01:28:00,005 --> 01:28:03,421
It had nothing to do with justice.
That lady I wrote you about?

1110
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:06,005
The one with the hat
and the twitchy mouth?

1111
01:28:06,136 --> 01:28:10,928
Right. When we got in the jury room,
and she started bitchin', "He's guilty. "

1112
01:28:11,057 --> 01:28:13,216
Then all of a sudden, "He's not guilty. "

1113
01:28:13,351 --> 01:28:16,306
- Well, how come?
- She was a lush.

1114
01:28:16,438 --> 01:28:18,395
And she had to get out to get a drink?

1115
01:28:18,523 --> 01:28:22,652
- Right. So I was saved by Gallo Wine.
- Who cares, man? You beat it.

1116
01:28:22,778 --> 01:28:26,776
I know, but I wanted to win it
on the First Amendment.

1117
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,195
I love you.

1118
01:28:31,495 --> 01:28:35,445
Wow, was I happy. I think he was too.

1119
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:38,747
He was making a lot of bread.

1120
01:28:38,877 --> 01:28:42,163
<i>After the San Francisco trial
and all that publicity,</i>

1121
01:28:42,298 --> 01:28:44,337
<i>everybody wanted to see him.</i>

1122
01:28:44,467 --> 01:28:49,212
<i>There were the semi-hip, Playboy-type
people who thought it was in to dig him.</i>

1123
01:28:49,346 --> 01:28:52,762
<i>And then there were the people
who really loved Lenny.</i>

1124
01:28:52,892 --> 01:28:54,766
You really are the truth.

1125
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:59,225
She's a nut...

1126
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:01,896
But she's right.

1127
01:29:02,026 --> 01:29:05,525
He started coming on like a rabbi.
I used to kid him about it.

1128
01:29:05,655 --> 01:29:08,276
<i>I'd call him "the Meshugana Messiah".</i>

1129
01:29:08,408 --> 01:29:14,078
But I'm not anti-Christ or anti-religion,
I just think it's encouraging that people

1130
01:29:14,205 --> 01:29:16,613
are leaving the church
and going back to God.

1131
01:29:16,749 --> 01:29:19,419
<i>He was putting
everybody down. The Pope.</i>

1132
01:29:19,544 --> 01:29:22,035
<i>I mean, jeez, he even went after Kennedy.</i>

1133
01:29:22,172 --> 01:29:25,706
I suppose people came in
to see if he might get arrested.

1134
01:29:25,842 --> 01:29:28,926
Oh, absolutely.
Right... right on. Right on.

1135
01:29:29,554 --> 01:29:34,679
You were with him when he was
arrested in Los Angeles and Chicago?

1136
01:29:35,477 --> 01:29:37,516
What's the matter?

1137
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:44,566
<i>Well, um, it's like that lady alcoholic
in I'll Cry Tomorrow.</i>

1138
01:29:44,695 --> 01:29:48,527
- Lillian Roth?
- No, Susan Hayward.

1139
01:29:49,616 --> 01:29:54,278
See, junkies think like...
"I'll kick tomorrow. "

1140
01:29:54,413 --> 01:29:58,660
And it was the same thing with me.

1141
01:29:59,835 --> 01:30:04,248
But, uh, tomorrow just...

1142
01:30:05,966 --> 01:30:10,094
<i>Follow the dots
down the yellow brick road.</i>

1143
01:30:10,221 --> 01:30:15,428
Goddammit! He was just fine until
you had to be schlepped into it again.

1144
01:30:15,559 --> 01:30:18,763
OK, I'll, uh, kill myself.

1145
01:30:21,941 --> 01:30:25,642
Lenny was deep into drugs
himself, though, wasn't he?

1146
01:30:25,778 --> 01:30:28,779
You're really cute, aren't you?
You want me to say it.

1147
01:30:28,906 --> 01:30:31,195
Monogram Pictures presents

1148
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:37,530
<i>Rotten Together, starring
Faye Wray and King Kong.</i>

1149
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:38,946
You think it's funny?

1150
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:41,206
King Kong's mother.

1151
01:30:41,336 --> 01:30:43,909
You two think you're so damn funny...

1152
01:30:49,135 --> 01:30:50,629
- Well?
- It's a waste of time.

1153
01:30:50,762 --> 01:30:53,051
The mercenary old bitch won't budge!

1154
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:55,850
- She has to.
- Yeah, well, you tell her.

1155
01:30:57,352 --> 01:31:00,803
Beth, he's in no condition to go on.
You can't let him go on.

1156
01:31:00,939 --> 01:31:05,731
Look at this. It's five bucks a head.
You know what that would cost me?

1157
01:31:05,861 --> 01:31:08,897
If he gets busted,
it'll cost you your liquor licence.

1158
01:31:09,031 --> 01:31:10,441
I'll take my chances.

1159
01:31:10,574 --> 01:31:15,651
Lenny, you've got to be a good boy
and get up and get on your feet.

1160
01:31:15,787 --> 01:31:19,370
<i>Lenny, you can't get up.</i>

1161
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:23,291
Come on, Lenny, you gotta get up.

1162
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:26,670
I know you can do it, man.

1163
01:31:26,799 --> 01:31:30,464
- They're all out there waiting for ya...
- I'm no junkie.

1164
01:31:30,594 --> 01:31:36,514
You can't disappoint the public.
There you go, man.

1165
01:31:37,184 --> 01:31:39,509
That's it.

1166
01:31:40,938 --> 01:31:42,765
I'm proud of you.

1167
01:31:58,289 --> 01:32:01,788
Uh-oh. There's the city heat.

1168
01:32:01,918 --> 01:32:05,038
There's the county heat.

1169
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:11,375
There's the state heat. And I even think
I see two cats from Interpol, man.

1170
01:32:13,555 --> 01:32:17,504
And I know I saw four Mounties, man!

1171
01:32:36,787 --> 01:32:40,867
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Lenny Bruce.</i>

1172
01:32:40,999 --> 01:32:42,458
Super Jew!

1173
01:33:04,106 --> 01:33:08,815
The Ecumenical Council has given
the Pope permission to become a nun.

1174
01:33:10,112 --> 01:33:12,686
But only on Fridays.

1175
01:33:15,493 --> 01:33:18,494
Wait. What's that?

1176
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:22,154
King Kong is ready now?

1177
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:23,702
Oh, he's almost ready.

1178
01:33:23,835 --> 01:33:28,046
Oh, we're gonna have King
for the second show.

1179
01:33:28,172 --> 01:33:33,084
Look, I gotta warn you photographers
not to take any flashbulbs.

1180
01:33:33,219 --> 01:33:35,011
Cool it with the flashbulbs, man,

1181
01:33:35,138 --> 01:33:38,756
because otherwise King gets
a little shitty, you know.

1182
01:33:40,518 --> 01:33:43,970
So just give him a...

1183
01:33:44,105 --> 01:33:46,857
air... a building to play with

1184
01:33:46,983 --> 01:33:53,022
or an airplane to squeeze and... Yeah.

1185
01:33:54,366 --> 01:33:56,654
Where the fuck was I?

1186
01:34:11,842 --> 01:34:15,840
It's really wild, man, because
a judge can get away with that.

1187
01:34:15,971 --> 01:34:20,882
He just sits up there, man,
just junked out of his head, man,

1188
01:34:21,018 --> 01:34:24,517
and he says
"I'll take it under advisement. "

1189
01:34:25,606 --> 01:34:28,476
Where was I, now?
Let me see, where was I?

1190
01:34:28,609 --> 01:34:33,318
Oh, yeah. I know... Yeah. I know what
I want to do. I know what I want to do.

1191
01:34:33,447 --> 01:34:36,614
You're all wondering
why I'm wearing this raincoat.

1192
01:34:36,742 --> 01:34:40,407
The reason I'm wearing this
raincoat is, as you all know...

1193
01:34:40,538 --> 01:34:43,076
I've been busted a few times
for obscenity,

1194
01:34:43,207 --> 01:34:45,829
and the last time I was busted
was in Los Angeles,

1195
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:51,500
and they didn't give me time to get my
coat. So, since Chicago is a cold city,

1196
01:34:51,632 --> 01:34:54,468
if they come, I'm ready.

1197
01:34:54,594 --> 01:34:58,010
And the heat... the heat is here
tonight. The heat is here.

1198
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:02,089
Oh, are there any attorneys here tonight?

1199
01:35:02,227 --> 01:35:05,726
Where? You are? Are you
an attorney, man? Really?

1200
01:35:05,855 --> 01:35:11,894
Here. Now you guys got it all, man. There.

1201
01:35:12,028 --> 01:35:14,400
That's it, man.

1202
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:20,449
Uh...

1203
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:26,705
I... I... No... I want to show you something.

1204
01:35:29,296 --> 01:35:31,751
Oh, I know what I want to show you.

1205
01:35:33,842 --> 01:35:35,835
You wanna see...

1206
01:35:35,969 --> 01:35:41,758
you wanna see a picture
of a really beautiful pink-nippled lady?

1207
01:35:46,021 --> 01:35:50,315
She's my wife, man. And I gave her away.

1208
01:35:53,779 --> 01:35:56,982
<i>Where are you going?
Wait a minute.</i>

1209
01:35:57,116 --> 01:35:59,192
Hey, where are you people going?

1210
01:35:59,326 --> 01:36:02,695
Oh, come on, man, I haven't
even said "cocksucker" yet.

1211
01:36:05,624 --> 01:36:08,495
Let 'em go, man. Let 'em go.

1212
01:36:12,924 --> 01:36:15,628
I can't work this shithouse.

1213
01:36:16,761 --> 01:36:19,133
My stomach is killing me.

1214
01:36:23,226 --> 01:36:26,559
I know what I want to do.
I know what I want to do.

1215
01:36:26,688 --> 01:36:29,013
This is for you guys over there.

1216
01:36:29,148 --> 01:36:33,193
I read in the Chicago paper...
I read in the Chicago paper.

1217
01:36:33,319 --> 01:36:36,237
There's an article here
about these transvestites

1218
01:36:36,364 --> 01:36:38,024
who are posing as policemen.

1219
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:41,324
Police officers who are
dressing up like pretty ladies.

1220
01:36:41,453 --> 01:36:45,237
Here is Officer Dolan. Stan, as the
guys call him down at the baths.

1221
01:36:45,373 --> 01:36:49,371
"Officer Stanley Dolan said that
the hardest part of police work

1222
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:52,290
was learning how
to walk in high heels, man. "

1223
01:36:52,422 --> 01:36:57,665
And I think that's a gas, man.
You guys are so naive, man.

1224
01:36:57,803 --> 01:37:01,670
I defend you all the time,
but you're so naive.

1225
01:37:01,807 --> 01:37:05,092
You think the guy's gonna
grab you and you're gonna say

1226
01:37:05,227 --> 01:37:10,683
"OK, now, stop that. You can't touch
me. I'm not a beautiful woman. "

1227
01:37:10,816 --> 01:37:15,063
"I'm a police officer
and you're under arrest. "

1228
01:37:15,195 --> 01:37:19,027
But you don't... guys don't know
who you're dealing with, man!

1229
01:37:19,158 --> 01:37:23,784
They don't care.
They'll just grab ya and they'll say

1230
01:37:23,913 --> 01:37:26,748
"I don't care if you are a cop,
you got a cute ass,

1231
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:30,124
and I'm gonna schtup you anyway, man. "

1232
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:34,457
It's not nice, man.

1233
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:40,011
Hey! It's not nice to incite!

1234
01:37:40,137 --> 01:37:42,675
It's not nice to entrap!

1235
01:37:42,807 --> 01:37:48,892
It's not nice to exploit those people, man.
They're sick people.

1236
01:37:49,021 --> 01:37:53,434
You wanna know what I'm talking about?
I'm talking about Vietnam!

1237
01:37:53,568 --> 01:37:55,607
It's like...

1238
01:38:01,951 --> 01:38:06,779
Catholicism is like
one big franchise, man.

1239
01:38:06,915 --> 01:38:10,414
It's like... it's like Howard Johnson's.

1240
01:38:10,543 --> 01:38:13,544
And Kennedy, man.

1241
01:38:13,672 --> 01:38:19,675
He... No, no, man, no. He can't...

1242
01:38:19,803 --> 01:38:24,928
Man, I can't put together
what I'm trying to say,

1243
01:38:25,058 --> 01:38:27,596
and the thing that I'm trying to tell you

1244
01:38:27,728 --> 01:38:31,393
is it's harassment, man!

1245
01:38:31,523 --> 01:38:34,773
It's repression!

1246
01:38:34,902 --> 01:38:39,729
It's club owners being called up
in the middle of the night,

1247
01:38:39,865 --> 01:38:42,866
and being told not to hire me

1248
01:38:42,993 --> 01:38:46,243
or they're gonna lose their liquor licence!

1249
01:38:46,372 --> 01:38:52,208
It's Vietnam! It's atrocities here and there!

1250
01:39:19,614 --> 01:39:21,690
I'm sorry.

1251
01:39:26,579 --> 01:39:29,366
<i>I'm not funny.</i>

1252
01:39:35,588 --> 01:39:37,914
<i>I'm not a comedian.</i>

1253
01:39:53,231 --> 01:39:57,395
<i>Listen to the ovation.</i>

1254
01:40:03,367 --> 01:40:05,988
- Get that door.
- Get out of the way!

1255
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:10,034
<i>- Let's go, lady!
- Please, don't hurt him.</i>

1256
01:40:10,165 --> 01:40:11,576
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1257
01:40:11,709 --> 01:40:15,753
This is America. You can't come
in my shithouse without a warrant.

1258
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,457
I love you.

1259
01:40:18,465 --> 01:40:22,084
I was arrested 13 times in the next year.

1260
01:40:23,387 --> 01:40:25,629
Um, I flipped out mentally.

1261
01:40:25,765 --> 01:40:28,303
I kept schlepping him
in and out of hospitals.

1262
01:40:28,434 --> 01:40:31,103
We were getting cancellations, bad press.

1263
01:40:31,228 --> 01:40:33,898
I wound up in a hospital...

1264
01:40:34,023 --> 01:40:37,059
in the psychiatric division...

1265
01:40:38,611 --> 01:40:40,568
in a padded cell.

1266
01:40:40,696 --> 01:40:43,781
Then he got picked up
for possession of narcotics.

1267
01:40:43,908 --> 01:40:46,909
Now he's got to fight that
in the courts, too, right?

1268
01:40:47,036 --> 01:40:49,954
Then his health started to go bad.

1269
01:40:50,081 --> 01:40:51,196
<i>- Rita?
- Yes, sir.</i>

1270
01:40:51,332 --> 01:40:54,582
Would you change my barber
appointment to 3.15 tomorrow?

1271
01:40:54,711 --> 01:40:58,294
He had pleurisy. One lung
had to be peeled three times.

1272
01:40:58,423 --> 01:41:00,083
And finally it collapsed.

1273
01:41:00,967 --> 01:41:04,668
There were days that would go by
when I didn't even know where I'd been.

1274
01:41:05,096 --> 01:41:10,435
<i>He was going broke fast, what
with the lawyer bills and the doctor bills.</i>

1275
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,395
The dope, and the pressure
with Honey and...

1276
01:41:13,522 --> 01:41:15,645
Just... I mean, poor guy, you know.

1277
01:41:15,774 --> 01:41:19,688
He had an incision that went from
his chest right through to his back.

1278
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:21,362
I'm sorry. Where were we?

1279
01:41:21,738 --> 01:41:24,988
This obscenity circus has been
going on for about four years!

1280
01:41:25,117 --> 01:41:28,486
It's a three-ring circus
starring the district attorney,

1281
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:30,909
the Lower Court
and the Supreme Court.

1282
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:34,907
I'm a schmuck who fell off a high wire
in the middle of it. It's killing me.

1283
01:41:35,044 --> 01:41:38,377
Can you turn the sound up, please?
The people can't hear me.

1284
01:41:38,505 --> 01:41:41,921
Thanks. OK, now, where was I?
Chicago bust: guilty.

1285
01:41:42,051 --> 01:41:44,293
That case is
now being appealed in lllinois,

1286
01:41:44,428 --> 01:41:48,640
citing the Daylight Book Company versus
Summerville, US268- no, wait a minute.

1287
01:41:48,766 --> 01:41:50,805
US 652. That's not...

1288
01:41:50,935 --> 01:41:53,177
Where are you going?
These are the jokes!

1289
01:41:53,312 --> 01:41:55,637
<i>- You want a bit?
- Do "Tits and Ass".</i>

1290
01:41:55,773 --> 01:41:59,189
No, I don't wanna do "Tits and Ass"!
I can't do...

1291
01:41:59,318 --> 01:42:01,856
You want to know
where it's really at with tits?

1292
01:42:01,988 --> 01:42:04,479
You see that chick? She has beautiful tits.

1293
01:42:04,615 --> 01:42:07,153
We couldn't take a picture
for the newspaper

1294
01:42:07,285 --> 01:42:09,858
because that's obscene, that's offensive.

1295
01:42:09,996 --> 01:42:11,953
I'll tell you what's offensive to me.

1296
01:42:12,081 --> 01:42:16,293
The pictures in the newspapers are
of tits that have been shot up, maimed...

1297
01:42:16,419 --> 01:42:19,835
- Turn the house lights on.
- .. burned. It's really weird.

1298
01:42:19,964 --> 01:42:23,583
- Come on. What's happening?
- This man's under arrest.

1299
01:42:23,718 --> 01:42:27,301
What, again? Oh, what the fuck
is going on here, man?

1300
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:29,553
What is it, getting chic to arrest me?

1301
01:42:29,683 --> 01:42:33,016
- He used the words... "fuck you".
- Objection, Your Honour!

1302
01:42:33,144 --> 01:42:35,718
Come on! That's out of context,
and you know it.

1303
01:42:35,855 --> 01:42:40,399
Overruled. Counsel will control
their client. You may continue.

1304
01:42:40,527 --> 01:42:44,739
All right, what else do you recall?
I mean, did he make a gesture...

1305
01:42:44,865 --> 01:42:46,857
- Objection!
- Leading the witness!

1306
01:42:46,992 --> 01:42:50,990
I'm sorry, Your Honour.
I'll rephrase the question for Mr Bruce.

1307
01:42:51,538 --> 01:42:54,741
All right, Sergeant.
What else do you recall happening?

1308
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:56,998
You could refer to your notebook.

1309
01:42:57,127 --> 01:43:00,164
- He made a gesture.
- Hey, man, you got it in.

1310
01:43:00,297 --> 01:43:03,464
- What sort of gesture?
- He used the microphone.

1311
01:43:04,218 --> 01:43:07,468
Would you mind demonstrating it
for the court, please?

1312
01:43:08,973 --> 01:43:12,009
I never meant that to mean "jack off".
It's pathetic!

1313
01:43:12,142 --> 01:43:14,265
He's doing my act for the court!

1314
01:43:14,395 --> 01:43:16,968
- Mr Bruce!
- How can you make a fair judgment?

1315
01:43:17,106 --> 01:43:20,439
What he is doing is obscene!
No, man, I want to tell them!

1316
01:43:20,568 --> 01:43:22,726
- I should be doing my act!
- Mr Bruce!

1317
01:43:22,862 --> 01:43:26,527
I can do me better than he does me!
I've been at it longer than anybody!

1318
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:32,620
If I could just talk to him eye to eye.
He's not a bad guy.

1319
01:43:32,747 --> 01:43:35,416
I can make him understand me.
He's a human being.

1320
01:43:35,541 --> 01:43:38,412
He doesn't want to hear
one more word from you.

1321
01:43:38,544 --> 01:43:40,620
He'll cite you for contempt.

1322
01:43:40,755 --> 01:43:43,542
You guys are not representing me
the way I have asked.

1323
01:43:43,675 --> 01:43:45,632
We're doing the best we can, Lenny.

1324
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,295
Did you talk to him about me
doing my act for the court?

1325
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:51,055
- No.
- Why?

1326
01:43:51,182 --> 01:43:53,934
He has all the tapes,
you've had several witnesses,

1327
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,385
and you're not in
a proper emotional state...

1328
01:43:56,521 --> 01:44:01,017
I'm fine, man. I just know if I don't do
my act for the court, I'm gonna lose!

1329
01:44:01,151 --> 01:44:04,686
Come on, man. You know it,
he knows it. I know it.

1330
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:07,028
Will you give us a coupla minutes alone?

1331
01:44:07,157 --> 01:44:10,407
No, if it's about me,
I wanna hear it, man. I'm not a baby.

1332
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:13,073
OK, have it your way.

1333
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:17,991
You don't have to whisper.

1334
01:44:18,126 --> 01:44:22,124
When it goes to the appellate court,
I don't want you in the record.

1335
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:24,379
We'll have to eat a guilty verdict.

1336
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:27,177
You are wild!
You eat the verdicts, I do the time!

1337
01:44:27,302 --> 01:44:31,051
- It is really bizarre!
- These lower courts are meaningless.

1338
01:44:31,181 --> 01:44:33,851
- They don't mean a thing.
- It'll be like Chicago.

1339
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:36,549
We'll appeal to the state,
you'll get relief there.

1340
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:39,260
That took two years
and every nickel I had!

1341
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:42,399
I had to borrow 10 bucks just to get here!

1342
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:44,815
I'm like a nigger
looking to use the toilet!

1343
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:47,483
By the time I get relief, it'll be too late.

1344
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:51,565
I don't wanna go to jail!
And I'll tell you something else!

1345
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:55,403
Either put me on the stand,
you let me do my act for that court,

1346
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:57,413
or I'm gonna sue your asses,

1347
01:44:57,542 --> 01:45:01,705
and go in there and represent myself,
and that's it! No more bullshit!

1348
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:07,459
If it please the court...
I wish to defend myself.

1349
01:45:07,593 --> 01:45:10,298
Your Honour, I can no longer
relate to my counsel.

1350
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:13,799
Mr Bruce, my suggestion is
that you now make a request

1351
01:45:13,933 --> 01:45:17,137
for a continuance,
for the purpose of retaining new counsel.

1352
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:19,891
If you do, then I will so grant that request.

1353
01:45:20,023 --> 01:45:22,348
I just want a chance to talk to the court,

1354
01:45:22,484 --> 01:45:26,434
just to talk to you without all
the legal double-talking bullshit.

1355
01:45:26,571 --> 01:45:29,323
You are making this very difficult for me.

1356
01:45:29,449 --> 01:45:31,655
Sorry, but attorneys keep telling me

1357
01:45:31,785 --> 01:45:35,652
"Don't worry, it's just the Lower Court,
they're all assholes. "

1358
01:45:35,789 --> 01:45:37,331
"We'll win in a higher court. "

1359
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:40,375
I shouldn't lose here.
I'm not doing anything wrong.

1360
01:45:40,502 --> 01:45:42,329
Would you please sit down?

1361
01:45:42,462 --> 01:45:46,163
- I do have the right to say things.
- I am running out of patience!

1362
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:49,834
If you'd just let me do my act
for the court, I'll take my chances.

1363
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:52,722
If after you hear me,
if you don't think it's funny,

1364
01:45:52,848 --> 01:45:56,928
if you think it has no redeeming
social value, if it strikes you as dirty...

1365
01:45:57,061 --> 01:45:59,349
I cannot allow this to continue!

1366
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:05,732
Your Honour... I so want your respect.

1367
01:46:06,695 --> 01:46:09,400
I know you're a good person
and this legal system

1368
01:46:09,532 --> 01:46:13,232
is the best in the world,
but you... you can't seem to hear me!

1369
01:46:13,369 --> 01:46:15,776
- Sit down!
- When I'm talking about tits and ass,

1370
01:46:15,913 --> 01:46:18,950
I'm not up there to shock
the audience by repeating

1371
01:46:19,083 --> 01:46:21,704
"tits and ass, ass and tits,
tits and ass!"

1372
01:46:21,836 --> 01:46:24,753
The point is that we all live
in a hypocritical society!

1373
01:46:24,881 --> 01:46:30,171
You leave me no alternative but
to find you in contempt of this court!

1374
01:46:33,056 --> 01:46:35,095
OK.

1375
01:46:39,145 --> 01:46:44,732
Then sentence me. I have no money left.
Might I be sentenced now?

1376
01:46:44,859 --> 01:46:48,394
I can't afford to be on trial.

1377
01:46:48,530 --> 01:46:52,362
The police took away my cabaret card.
I can't work any more.

1378
01:46:52,492 --> 01:46:56,360
- Please, sentence me.
- No, I will not sentence you today.

1379
01:46:56,496 --> 01:47:00,957
I order you, when you appear before me
again, to appear with suitable counsel.

1380
01:47:01,084 --> 01:47:05,663
And I am further ordering psychiatric
evaluation by the psychiatric clinic.

1381
01:47:05,797 --> 01:47:09,581
- December 16th. Bail continued.
- You're trying to stop the information!

1382
01:47:09,718 --> 01:47:12,635
Bailiff, will you remove
this man from the courtroom?

1383
01:47:12,763 --> 01:47:14,471
Court adjourned!

1384
01:47:14,598 --> 01:47:17,385
.. the information
keeps the country strong!

1385
01:47:17,518 --> 01:47:21,183
You need the deviate! Don't shut him up!

1386
01:47:21,313 --> 01:47:25,227
You need that madman to stand up,
tell you when you're blowing it!

1387
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:28,526
The harder you come down on him,
the more you need him!

1388
01:47:28,654 --> 01:47:33,197
Please! Don't take away my words!
They're just words!

1389
01:47:33,325 --> 01:47:35,448
I'm not hurting anybody!

1390
01:47:42,084 --> 01:47:46,082
<i>He was found guilty in New York
and sentenced to four months, right?</i>

1391
01:47:46,213 --> 01:47:47,589
Yes.

1392
01:47:47,715 --> 01:47:51,250
- He was frightened of being confined?
- Yes.

1393
01:47:51,385 --> 01:47:54,837
<i>Among his belongings,
they found a letter from the bank,</i>

1394
01:47:54,972 --> 01:47:56,799
<i>that said he had lost the house.</i>

1395
01:47:56,933 --> 01:48:02,389
Do you suppose those things and that
letter had anything to do with his death?

1396
01:48:02,522 --> 01:48:04,146
I don't know what you mean.

1397
01:48:04,274 --> 01:48:05,269
See you Saturday.

1398
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,235
Get some sleep and do something
about that weight.

1399
01:48:08,361 --> 01:48:12,573
Yeah, you're right.
I'm gonna go on a diet. Bye-bye.

1400
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,151
Bye, man.

1401
01:48:26,379 --> 01:48:29,914
I know where you're trying
to take this, and it's just not so.

1402
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:32,042
<i>He'd never do a thing like that.</i>

1403
01:48:34,513 --> 01:48:36,552
Anyway...

1404
01:48:41,144 --> 01:48:44,098
Anyway, why was he
trying to lose weight?

1405
01:48:44,231 --> 01:48:47,481
I loved him. I really loved him.

1406
01:48:47,609 --> 01:48:50,776
I'm very happy that his records
are starting to sell again.

1407
01:48:50,904 --> 01:48:56,195
He was nutty, you know?
He did a lot of crazy things.

1408
01:48:57,661 --> 01:49:01,244
And we were always doing bits
to crack each other up.

1409
01:49:01,373 --> 01:49:04,956
<i>Doesn't it strike you as rather ironic that</i>

1410
01:49:05,086 --> 01:49:07,837
<i>the things that Lenny was arrested for</i>

1411
01:49:07,963 --> 01:49:12,625
<i>would be considered
fairly harmless today?</i>

1412
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:17,303
<i>Well, like, um,
I don't really know about that.</i>

1413
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,640
I mean...

1414
01:49:24,647 --> 01:49:29,393
He was just so damn funny.

1415
01:49:30,153 --> 01:49:33,486
You know I'm negotiating
for a film based on his life?

1416
01:49:33,615 --> 01:49:35,157
I got all the rights tied up.

1417
01:49:35,283 --> 01:49:38,533
Oh, listen, I'm afraid
that's all the time I have.

1418
01:49:38,661 --> 01:49:41,152
I have to get out to the Valley,
catch a comic.

1419
01:49:41,289 --> 01:49:43,412
Thank you very much.

1420
01:49:43,625 --> 01:49:45,701
Thank you very much.

1421
01:49:45,835 --> 01:49:48,161
- Thank you very much.
- It was a pleasure.

1422
01:49:50,048 --> 01:49:56,252
<i>Into the shithouse for good
this time. Forget it. Oh, man. Forget it.</i>
