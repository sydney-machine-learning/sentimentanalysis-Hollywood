1
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,144
Excuse me.

2
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,814
Excuse me.

3
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,449
- Nervous?
- No.

4
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,871
- I hate flying.
- It's something I ate.

5
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,623
Maybe you're just excited
about getting home.

6
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,127
- No, I think it's the baklavas.
- Told you not to eat them.

7
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,799
- I've got to go to the john again.
- I'll wait.

8
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:42,972
- No, I'll catch up to you. Okay?
- Okay.

9
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,036
Passport.

10
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,718
Basket.

11
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,080
It's a frisbee.

12
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,920
You throw it and catch it.
It's a game.

13
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,755
A game.

14
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,896
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, great. Want a piece of gum?

15
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,316
Thank you.

16
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:45,488
See this?
Janis Joplin died yesterday.

17
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,741
Overdose.
There never was anyone like Janis.

18
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,535
There never was anyone like you.

19
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,288
Knock it off.

20
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,249
- You never take anything seriously.
- Nothing.

21
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,733
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

22
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,321
They always have everything
ass backwards in Turkey.

23
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,287
- Billy, what's the matter?
- Passport. Susan, get on the plane.

24
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,541
What is it Billy? What's wrong,
are you sick?

25
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,962
Get on the plane. Go.

26
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,575
I'm looking for my passport.

27
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,499
Harry, you'd better
get rid of those grenades.

28
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,813
Get down.

29
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,219
- Name?
- William Hayes.

30
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,973
- William...
- Hayes.

31
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,267
Hayes.

32
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,813
- American?
- That's right.

33
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,234
Yes, American. United States.

34
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,070
American.

35
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,881
- Name?
- Jesus... William Hayes.

36
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:20,012
- Name?
- Hayes. H-A-Y-E-S.

37
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:05,325
Howdy, Billy.
How are you doing? Okay?

38
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:14,251
I think these gentlemen
have finished for the time being.

39
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,504
If you'd like
to put your clothes on.

40
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,073
The officer wants to know
if you're afraid.

41
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,369
No, I'm not afraid.

42
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,178
The officer said
there's nothing to be afraid of.

43
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,014
Cooperate,
and you'll be on the plane home.

44
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,778
Where did you get the hashish?

45
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,948
From a cab driver.

46
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,450
In the playing shop at the bazaar.

47
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,216
Would you recognize him again?

48
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,469
I think so.

49
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,604
You decided to fly at a bad time.

50
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,817
Guerrillas all over the place,
blowing up planes and all.

51
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,569
Stupid.

52
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,073
Four planes in four days.
Don't you read the newspapers?

53
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:13,036
There's been a shit storm
over the flow of heroin from Turkey.

54
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,456
- I didn't have heroin.
- A drug is a drug.

55
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,670
It was my first time.
It was only two kilos.

56
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,757
It doesn't matter
if it was two or 200 kilos.

57
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,428
Catching you shows the world
Turkey is fighting the drug trade.

58
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:34,850
- Are you with the Consulate?
- Something like that. Cigarette?

59
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,732
- What did you pay this cab driver?
- $200. My last 200.

60
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,027
- How much did you figure to make?
- I'd only sell it to my friends.

61
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,324
- I'm not a pusher. Honest.
- It beats working.

62
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:56,413
- Have you got a family?
- Mother, father, brother, sister.

63
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,958
- Long Island.
- It'll be tough on them.

64
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:05,672
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah, she was on the plane.

65
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,385
She didn't know anything about it.
I didn't want her to.

66
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,889
Lucky girl.

67
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:18,352
- She used to say I was lucky.
- Let's hope so, Billy.

68
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,981
You seem like a nice enough kid.

69
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,651
But you try it,
and I'll blow your brains out.

70
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:13,730
Mom and Dad, this is the hardest
letter I've ever had to write.

71
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:20,403
I hoped to get out of this quickly,
so you'd never know about it.

72
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:26,952
But that just isn't possible now.
I don't know what's going to happen.

73
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:31,498
What can I say to you?
Will "I'm sorry" make a difference?

74
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:36,336
Will it ease the pain,
the shame you must be feeling?

75
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,715
Forgive me, please.

76
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,234
Could I have a blanket?

77
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,862
It's cold.
Could I have a blanket?

78
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:08,743
- A blanket!
- Too late. Tomorrow.

79
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,663
He'll be here tomorrow, I think.

80
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,292
Goodnight.

81
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,874
- Can you speak English?
- Your cell is open.

82
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,127
Blankets, three cells down.
You get me one.

83
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,918
I needed a blanket. I was cold.

84
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,297
William Hayes.

85
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,650
I needed a blanket, I was cold!

86
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,560
Jesus...

87
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,105
Come on, you must stand.

88
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,986
You'd better walk around,
or your feet will swell up.

89
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,655
You've got to be crazy.

90
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:18,910
We all are. Smoke some of this,
cool the pain.

91
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:24,165
You've been out for days,
talking all kinds of shit.

92
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,668
We'll walk you down
to the courtyard.

93
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,004
- How does it feel?
- About as good as it looks.

94
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:37,595
Gecmis olsun. It's Turkish.
It means, "May it pass quickly."

95
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,643
- It looks like a cheap hotel.
- The room service is lousy.

96
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:48,022
I'm Jimmy Booth.
This is Erich, something Swedish.

97
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,234
- Just Erich.
- He cleaned you up.

98
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,112
Thanks. I'm Billy Hayes.

99
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,197
At least I used to be.

100
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,906
- Why peacocks?
- The Turks use them instead of dogs.

101
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,076
They scream like mad if they're
disturbed and they don't get rabies.

102
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,163
The old sultans used to use them
to guard their harem.

103
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,666
Who are the kids?

104
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:56,299
Little fuckers. Thieves, rapists,
murderers... You name it, they do it.

105
00:27:56,592 --> 00:28:00,553
Don't trust any of them.
They tell Rifki everything.

106
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,432
He's the squeal around here.
He sells tea...

107
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,436
hash, blankets,
anything for a buck.

108
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,524
- What are you in for, hash?
- Yeah.

109
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,654
- Where?
- At the airport, trying to get home.

110
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,281
That's heavy.

111
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,867
- You think so?
- Yeah, I think so.

112
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,577
This ain't the good old USA.

113
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:28,456
In Turkey, it's a fucking accident
if you're innocent.

114
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,835
- Nobody here is innocent.
- Don't pay too much attention.

115
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,421
Anything is possible in Turkey.

116
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,966
He's talking about if they hit you
for smuggling, it can be bad.

117
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:43,304
If they make it possession,
you might even get bail.

118
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:49,018
If you make bail, you're free.
Sneak across the border to Greece.

119
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:53,856
Sure, keep dreaming.
See where it gets you. Like Max.

120
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:59,529
It's going to be a while
before you taste a hamburger again.

121
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,323
You broke the law,
and you got caught.

122
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,283
The law is sometimes wrong.

123
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,495
The law is never wrong, asshole.

124
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,748
The fucking law is.

125
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,343
People get on his nerves.

126
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,678
What's he in for?

127
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,431
Caught stealing from a mosque,
that's heavy here.

128
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,892
- What did he steal?
- Two candlesticks.

129
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,563
- That's all?
- Jimmy has more balls than brains.

130
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,525
He was in for a year and a half
before he even told his parents.

131
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:44,115
- What about you?
- Hashish, like most foreigners.

132
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,285
- What did they give you?
- 12 years.

133
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,037
- How much you have?
- I had 100 grams.

134
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:55,710
You've got to get a good lawyer.
Talk to the Englishman. Max.

135
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,044
He's been in the longest.

136
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,881
- How long?
- Seven years.

137
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,025
Gastro.

138
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,445
Stomach medicine.

139
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,575
It's got codeine in it.
It's the best I can do around here.

140
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,869
Max?

141
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,247
Lawyers...?

142
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, yeah.

143
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,254
There's no straight lawyers
in Turkey.

144
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,423
They're all bent.

145
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:49,514
Bent as hairpins.
Occupational necessity.

146
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,267
They have special classes
in corruption at night school.

147
00:30:55,938 --> 00:31:00,107
If you're suspected of honesty,
you're disbarred.

148
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,449
I knew a lawyer fellow once.

149
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:14,205
He got that Frenchman off.
La Roche.

150
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,294
A big smuggler.

151
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,422
200 kilos.

152
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,054
He put enough bread
in enough pockets. Got bail.

153
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,682
Vanished.

154
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,477
His name?

155
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,314
Who?

156
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,983
The lawyer.

157
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,111
Lawyer?

158
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,613
Who got the Frenchman off.

159
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:57,164
Yesil is his name.

160
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,587
I don't know anything else
about him.

161
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,214
Yesil.

162
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,305
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

163
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,140
Best way you can.

164
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,686
- Yeah, but how?
- Catch the midnight express.

165
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,147
What's that?

166
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,944
It's not a train.

167
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,032
It's a prison word for...

168
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,701
escape.

169
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,500
It doesn't stop around here.

170
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,883
Dad, I'm sorry.

171
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,344
Forget it.

172
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,264
I'll punch you in the nose later.

173
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,352
We've got to get you out of here.

174
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:46,232
This is a suit I brought for you.

175
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,528
Smarten you up a little.

176
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,785
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

177
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,621
How's Mom?

178
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,626
Well, she's bad.

179
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,756
She couldn't make the trip.
You know Mom. Her boy...

180
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,680
Susan told us
before we got your letter.

181
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,350
She's saving to come back here.

182
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,644
Don't let her come.

183
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,981
How's Rob? How's Peg?

184
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,151
They're the same. You know.

185
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:35,156
We told the neighbors
you were in a hospital in Europe.

186
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:42,496
This is Stanley Daniels.
He's the American Consul here.

187
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,832
Hello, Billy, nice to know you.

188
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,376
I want you to know we're gonna
do everything in our power...

189
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,086
to get you out of here.

190
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:56,510
That's Necdit Yesil,
the lawyer you asked for.

191
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,682
I know exactly what you feel,
but you must not worry.

192
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,353
We'll get the right court
and the right judge.

193
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:10,107
I'll arrange everything, just right.

194
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:17,990
I understand that if you get bail,
it's easy to get across the border.

195
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:24,497
That's what we're shooting for.
I've spoken to the State Department.

196
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:29,877
Right now, relations with the Turks
aren't too good. Nixon upset them.

197
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,505
Our best bet is right here.

198
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,467
Dad, I'll pay you back for this.
I promise.

199
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,888
Money doesn't matter, Billy.
Not at this stage.

200
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,188
Where did you get that limp?

201
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:52,483
Nothing, I just twisted my ankle.

202
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,611
Where are you staying?

203
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,696
The Hilton.

204
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,825
How do you like Istanbul?

205
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,369
Interesting place.

206
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,999
The food is lousy. The crap
they sell in the restaurants...

207
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,878
I had to run to the toilet.
You should have seen the toilet.

208
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,631
I'm not taking any more chances.

209
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:21,929
I'll eat at the Hilton every night.
Steak, french fries and ketchup.

210
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,272
Billy...

211
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,109
Why did you do it?

212
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,905
Money.

213
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:44,410
I know you kids smoke that stuff
and we drink booze...

214
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:48,455
but taking it across the border,
that's stupid.

215
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,457
I know.

216
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,002
Dad.

217
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,548
Get me out of here.

218
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,636
I promise you. Just sit tight.

219
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:07,892
Let me work with Mr. Daniels
and Mr. Yesil here.

220
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,768
We'll get you out, okay?

221
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,814
Hey, Billy.

222
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,066
Okay?

223
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,528
Okay.

224
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,674
- What did that prosecutor say?
- It's not important.

225
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,592
Just technical.

226
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,181
We made our case. You spoke well.
The judge liked you.

227
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:33,912
Mr. Hayes, the judge is coming back.

228
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,334
- Four years, two months.
- Four years?

229
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,169
We'll appeal, you will see.

230
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:28,842
It'll be reduced for good behavior.
It is only for possession.

231
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,387
The prosecutor wanted
a life sentence for smuggling.

232
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,932
That is quite a difference,
believe me.

233
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,186
To be honest, Mr. Hayes,
it is a great victory.

234
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:53,242
With good time,
it works out to about...

235
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,036
three years.

236
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,831
And then there's the appeal.

237
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:07,881
Daniels and Yesil
are all working for you.

238
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,844
We're trying to get you transferred
to a State-side prison.

239
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:17,766
Daniels thinks there might be
a political amnesty any month now.

240
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:25,691
All right, Billy.

241
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,026
I know it sounds tough...

242
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,738
but we are going to get you out.

243
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:37,244
I promise you.
Don't do anything stupid.

244
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,414
They could play with your sentence.

245
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,127
All right, now...

246
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:53,552
I'm putting $500 in the bank.
Anything you need...

247
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,137
you write.

248
00:41:55,305 --> 00:42:00,517
There's food here,
candy, writing paper...

249
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:07,941
books, cigarettes, soap,
toothbrush.

250
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:16,450
I've sold insurance for 30 years.

251
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:19,036
Now I've got to see my own son...

252
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,456
Jesus.

253
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,715
If I could be where you are...

254
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,720
I'd be there.

255
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:39,973
I love you, Dad.

256
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:16,218
You take good care of my boy,
or I'll have your fucking head!

257
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:56,276
Dear Susan,
1970 has now passed into 1971.

258
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,404
You can drift in here
and never know you're gone.

259
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,866
You can fade so far out, you
don't know where you are any more...

260
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,285
or where anything else is.

261
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:11,625
I find loneliness is a physical pain
that hurts all over.

262
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,836
You can't isolate it
in one part of your body.

263
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:39,486
You know. Right there. Right there.

264
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:49,121
To the Turks
everything is "söyle böyle."

265
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:53,542
It means "like this, like that."
You never know what will happen.

266
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:59,339
All foreigners are "ayip."
They're considered dirty.

267
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:02,968
So is homosexuality.
That's a big crime here.

268
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,137
But most of them do it
every chance they get.

269
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:09,933
There are about 1000 things
that are "ayip."

270
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,186
You can stab or shoot somebody
below the waist but not above.

271
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,355
Because that's intent to kill.

272
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,734
So everybody runs around stabbing
everyone else in the ass.

273
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,695
That's what they call
"Turkish revenge."

274
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:28,952
I know it must sound crazy to you,
but this place is crazy.

275
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,004
One day,
one of the new kids was raped.

276
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:42,883
So they picked out
four of the worst kids.

277
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:19,312
Then there's Rifki. The more
I know of him, the more I hate him.

278
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,149
$10 for this shit? You pig.

279
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:27,362
There are no pigs in Turkey.

280
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:33,743
- This shit is shit.
- No, it's good. Good shit.

281
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,747
- You big shit.
- Yeah, me big shit.

282
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,769
You asshole.

283
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,820
What is it with you?
Just what the hell is it, man?

284
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,119
You don't fuck with me,
I don't fuck with you.

285
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,914
You fuck with me all the time.
You make crummy tea.

286
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:27,130
- You rip us off on the hash.
- I make special tea for you.

287
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:32,218
We have to live like brothers.
We have to be in here together.

288
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:36,222
Shove it, Rifki. For all the money
you've got, you've got nothing.

289
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,434
- You are American, you don't know.
- Know what?

290
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,730
Dog eat dog.

291
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:48,568
You fuck other man before he
fucks you. And you must fuck last.

292
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:00,580
Come on down. Come on.

293
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,005
Egbert.

294
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,468
Sodding cat.

295
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,537
William!

296
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:49,833
Are you all right?

297
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:55,296
The new American Ambassador
is following your case.

298
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:59,968
He says there is progress.
You want a cigarette?

299
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,847
But there is another route...

300
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:09,143
that is quite possible.

301
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:13,273
For a proper amount of money,
it is possible...

302
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,069
to convince the ten officials
to lose track of your papers...

303
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:21,281
before the High Court in Ankara
confirms the sentence...

304
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,951
of a lower court in Istanbul.
You would not exist.

305
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,746
And you could be in Greece by
the time the Turkish court...

306
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,292
discover their stupid
clerical mistake.

307
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:41,384
But I have to act before the
official sentence is handed down.

308
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:49,976
And for that
I must pay certain officials.

309
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,616
What's that?

310
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:14,042
- The blueprints.
- To what?

311
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,002
To the prison, man.

312
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:19,589
There was this German architect
in the hospital.

313
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,258
He was helping the Turks
build some shit around the place.

314
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,303
I laid some bread on him
and he let me copy them.

315
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:29,515
It's too bad
you didn't have a Xerox machine.

316
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,937
There are two ways out of here.

317
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:37,690
One is over the roof,
but that's kind of risky.

318
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,651
Maybe one person.
Two at the most.

319
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:45,198
The other way, I'll need your help,
and that is under.

320
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,244
A tunnel?

321
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:56,292
- Are you serious?
- This is not Stalag 17.

322
00:54:56,919 --> 00:55:01,631
That's where you're wrong.
The tunnel is already built.

323
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:05,885
There's a basement
where they used to keep weapons.

324
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:13,017
Beneath that are the catacombs the
Christians built to bury their dead.

325
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,814
We're sitting right on top of it here.

326
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,612
The kraut says that there's
a bunch of hollow shafts.

327
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,158
They're like dumbwaiters,
all along these walls.

328
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,705
One of them
is right next to our shower.

329
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:37,500
If we get in there,
we can get down into the catacombs.

330
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:41,337
With three of us working,
it shouldn't take too long.

331
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,798
Must be around here someplace.

332
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:47,010
I swear I heard a couple of dead
Christians singing down there.

333
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:53,891
- You stop shitting me, man. Okay?
- How do we get into the shaft?

334
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,730
We knock three times and say
we're a friend of the deceased.

335
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:04,360
I'm getting this together and
I don't need no gastro-head along.

336
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:07,655
You understand me?

337
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:19,959
- We go through the wall.
- We go through the wall?

338
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,213
Go through the wall.

339
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:48,321
The kraut was right. I checked it out.

340
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:50,865
There's no reinforced steel
in those shower walls.

341
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,659
It's real soft
from underground seepage.

342
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,496
The water like weeps
through the cement.

343
00:56:56,747 --> 00:57:00,083
Twenty, thirty years.
You can almost push it over.

344
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,544
All we have to do...

345
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:08,883
We only have to use your screwdriver
to scrape the mortar out.

346
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:12,970
We pull out three stones
and squeeze through...

347
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:26,818
Squeeze through, put them back,
and get our ass down the shaft.

348
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:31,697
- It's a two-night operation.
- What do we do in the catacombs?

349
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,867
What do you want, a door?

350
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,163
There's miles of them down there.
Like a sewer system.

351
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:44,168
- You must be fucking crazy.
- They've got to come up someplace.

352
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,712
You've had your ass stopped
just one too many times.

353
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,591
You won't find any catacombs,
you'll just finish up in section 13.

354
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:57,265
Billy. The tunnel or the roof?

355
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:01,060
Forget the wall.
Rifki's always there.

356
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:07,150
- The roof is guarded.
- Help me get into the shaft.

357
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,944
If we get caught,
I'll get the shaft.

358
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,029
Now I'm facing another 20 months.

359
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,992
I'll be back up to
three years again, maybe more.

360
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:22,415
Fuck it, then.
You choose your own death.

361
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:28,045
I'll do this thing on my own.
I'm taking the roof out of here.

362
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,858
No! I can't take it!

363
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:33,569
Dear Susan,
Jimmy was caught and beaten badly.

364
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:37,573
He got a severe hernia
and lost a testicle.

365
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,117
He's been in the sanatorium
for months.

366
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:45,706
In comparison,
my problems seem small.

367
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:49,043
But two and a half years
have gone by.

368
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:53,965
The Turks
are slowly draining my life away.

369
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:08,396
- Why do you keep your hair short?
- To remind me.

370
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,857
- Remind you of what?
- How much I hate it here.

371
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:08,831
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.

372
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:15,296
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.

373
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:21,594
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.

374
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:27,767
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.

375
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,273
Prison...

376
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:40,483
- Okay.
- I've been thinking about another way.

377
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,235
- Another way what?
- Out of here.

378
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,778
Oh, yeah?

379
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:50,743
When I was in the sanatorium,
there was only one guard on my ward.

380
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:55,456
- I could have got out of there.
- Why didn't you?

381
01:03:55,624 --> 01:04:00,920
As soon as I could walk,
they threw me back in here.

382
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:05,591
- Lucky you.
- I tell you, Billy...

383
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:10,888
Another ward in the sanatorium
had no guard on it at all.

384
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,766
- Who was in it?
- Three guys.

385
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:18,646
- What was wrong with them?
- I don't know.

386
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:25,069
- I think they were dead.
- It figures.

387
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:37,498
I've got to go. It's Daniels!
Turkish justice has done it again.

388
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:43,796
They're going to let me off my last
53 days. Jimmy, I'm going home!

389
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:48,926
God! "I've got to go."

390
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,653
What's wrong?

391
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,657
Sit down, Billy.

392
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,788
I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

393
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:23,043
- Is it Dad? Mom?
- No.

394
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:29,633
- You're going to have a new court.
- What do you mean?

395
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:34,847
The prosecutor objected
to your sentence for possession.

396
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:39,518
He wanted a smuggling conviction.
The Ankara court reviewed it.

397
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:45,316
It seems everyone wanted
an example made. A scapegoat.

398
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:47,151
And?

399
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:53,365
We've been notified
that they rejected the sentence.

400
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,538
There were 35 judges in the court.

401
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:03,626
28 voted for a life sentence.

402
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:10,049
The lower court in Istanbul
had to go along with the decision.

403
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:16,013
The judge likes you.
He notified your dad.

404
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:19,516
What do you mean, life?

405
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:23,896
- Life for what?
- Billy!

406
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:29,443
I have 53 days left! I have 53 days left!
I have 53 days left!

407
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:37,993
You goddamn bastard!
I have 53 days... Let me go!

408
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,881
So now it's time for me to speak.

409
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:54,134
What is there for me to say?

410
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:59,515
When I finish,
you'll sentence me for my crime.

411
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,103
So let me ask you now:

412
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,106
What is a crime?

413
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:10,109
What is a punishment?

414
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:16,490
It seems to vary from time to time
and place to place.

415
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,618
What's legal today
is suddenly illegal tomorrow...

416
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,705
because some society
says it's so.

417
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:29,586
What's illegal is suddenly legal
because everybody's doing it.

418
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:32,631
You can't put everybody in jail.

419
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:37,469
I'm not saying
this is right or wrong.

420
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:42,141
I'm just saying
that's the way it is.

421
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:50,607
I've spent three and a half years
of my life in your prison.

422
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:55,487
I think I've paid for my error.

423
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:03,996
If it's your decision today
to sentence me to more years...

424
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:23,056
My lawyer... That's a good one.
He says, "Be cool, Billy."

425
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,516
Don't get angry. Don't get upset.

426
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:31,023
"Be good. I'll get you a pardon,
an amnesty, an appeal."

427
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:35,569
This has been going on now
for three and a half years.

428
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:42,201
I've been playing it cool.
I've been good.

429
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,164
Now I'm damn tired of being good.

430
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:51,919
Because you people gave me the belief
that I had 53 days left.

431
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:59,384
You hung 53 days in my face,
and then you took them away.

432
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,221
And you!

433
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:06,725
I wish you could be standing
where I'm standing right now.

434
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:10,938
Then you would know something
that you don't know.

435
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,731
Mercy!

436
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:18,612
You would know that the concept
of a society...

437
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,782
is based on the quality
of that mercy.

438
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:25,244
Its sense of fair play and justice.

439
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,625
But I guess that's like asking
a bear to shit in a toilet.

440
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:47,099
For a nation of pigs,
it sure is funny you don't eat them.

441
01:09:56,776 --> 01:10:02,406
Jesus Christ forgave the bastards,
but I can't.

442
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,995
I hate.

443
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:13,000
I hate you.

444
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:18,338
I hate your nation
and I hate your people.

445
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:23,594
I fuck your sons and daughters
because they're pigs.

446
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,972
You're a pig.

447
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,105
You're all pigs.

448
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,964
My hands are tied by Ankara.

449
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:14,394
I must sentence you, William Hayes,
to be imprisoned...

450
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:17,689
for a term no less than 30 years.

451
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,695
May it pass quickly.

452
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:52,057
Got the old Istanbul blues

453
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,935
Istanbul blues

454
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:59,856
They give me 30 years

455
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,696
Ain't got nothing left to lose

456
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:10,784
We are going to get you out.
I promise you.

457
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:15,956
Don't do anything stupid.
They could play with your sentence.

458
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:26,466
I was busted at the border

459
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:30,178
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

460
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:34,266
The best way you can.

461
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:18,310
Hey, I think I found it.
Come here.

462
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:23,857
Listen to that.
Do you hear anything?

463
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:31,031
I told you, you suckers.
You didn't believe me.

464
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,785
Keep it down. Keep it down.
Keep it down.

465
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:41,291
Look how soft this is.
It'll be easy.

466
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:44,711
Go and get Rifki's poker,
but don't wake him up.

467
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:49,257
Go on. Go on!
Look how soft it is.

468
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:11,988
It's really soft. It's coming.

469
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:19,871
- Jimmy, it's coming.
- Here, use this.

470
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:28,213
It's coming real easy.
It's coming right out.

471
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:33,677
It's easier than I thought.
It's a piece of cake.

472
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:46,189
It's coming.

473
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,152
Like butter.

474
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:52,529
Hey, Max. Rifki.

475
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:16,094
- Keep checking for Rifki.
- It's okay.

476
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:36,489
- Watch it.
- I thought you wanted out of here.

477
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:44,414
- They're loose.
- Let's try.

478
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:48,293
- You wanna split your hernia again.
- Fuck that. Let's just get this.

479
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:57,802
- Okay? You got it?
- Yeah.

480
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,770
- That's it.
- You see it?

481
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:08,980
It's the shaft.

482
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,782
It's coming.

483
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:28,333
It's okay.

484
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:41,846
- Let's go, Billy.
- It's too late. We're not prepared.

485
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,349
- We'll go tomorrow. It's too late.
- Let's go now.

486
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,476
It's too late. We'll go tomorrow.

487
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:49,062
Let's put them back. Help me.

488
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:18,717
Any fuck-ups
and we should be back by dawn.

489
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,052
You got everything?

490
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:26,683
Maps, rail road, bus timetables.

491
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:31,813
Okay, let's do it.

492
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:37,796
- Can you see?
- No.

493
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,355
Come on, Max,
get your ass down here.

494
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:57,148
It's easy.

495
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:02,695
This way to Istanbul, baby.

496
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:12,288
Watch it.
Mind how you go there.

497
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:19,170
Are you all right?
Come down this pole and cross over.

498
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:24,175
Terrific.

499
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:33,685
- All right, it's a tunnel.
- Let's go.

500
01:19:57,168 --> 01:19:59,586
Come on, Max.

501
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:13,558
Fuck! What is that? Shit!

502
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:32,660
Shit! It's a dead end.

503
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,372
The Turks must have blocked it up.

504
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,585
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

505
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:44,797
Billy!

506
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:51,888
What the fuck are we going to do?
What time is it?

507
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:55,600
4:30.

508
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:03,107
- Go back.
- You must be fucking joking.

509
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:09,739
We go back, seal it up,
and come back tomorrow.

510
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:14,077
Every night, until we get out.

511
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:16,079
There's got to be a way out.

512
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,639
Billy, they found it.

513
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,808
- Who?
- Rifki.

514
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,642
No do, no do.

515
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:30,945
No! No! No!

516
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,417
Filthy little bastard.

517
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:48,171
This time I'm going to kick your brains
all over your fucking kitchen.

518
01:22:48,339 --> 01:22:51,758
Fine! Good. Man to man.

519
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:58,931
When we're finished, I'll bring
Hamidou and he'll kick your ass.

520
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:03,686
Let's go, Max. Come on.

521
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:16,741
- I know what I'm going to do.
- What?

522
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:22,246
- I'm going to cut his throat.
- Whose?

523
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,998
Rifki.

524
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,963
What have I got to lose?

525
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:35,093
Anyway, I'd really enjoy it.

526
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:44,477
Why don't you sit down?
You're in no shape to kill anybody.

527
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:50,108
- I want to cut his fucking throat.
- It's already been cut.

528
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,783
Then I'll cut his balls off.

529
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:09,127
You know, if you really
wanted to hurt Rifki...

530
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:16,718
His money. Steal that
and you steal his life's blood.

531
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:22,306
Could you see his face if everything
he had got snatched?

532
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:26,644
- If we only knew where he hid it.
- I know where it is.

533
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:30,148
Max...

534
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:34,736
The money?

535
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:40,825
Them that hides can find, says I.

536
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:49,333
I've seen him, the big tit.

537
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:56,632
He looks at it, late at night.

538
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:02,430
Talking to it.

539
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,350
Where?

540
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:13,983
Max, where?

541
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:19,363
The money, where?

542
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,035
In his radio.

543
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:28,539
In the back of his radio.

544
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:35,254
That's why he never plays it.

545
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:38,377
- He never had one.
- Soon he's back on the street.

546
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:42,715
No friends, no money,
plenty of enemies.

547
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:48,846
- I'll drink to that.
- Me, too.

548
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:58,189
- I've just got some news on Jimmy.
- Really? What?

549
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:03,527
They sent him to the hospital.
They ruptured his hernia again.

550
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:08,866
- Shit!
- I guess he didn't talk.

551
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:15,206
Look at Rifki, wearing a suit.

552
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,876
Maybe he's got a new job.

553
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:29,887
Jesus! Not again.

554
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,435
Hashish.

555
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:38,456
You're kidding! Me?

556
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,964
I didn't sell him anything.

557
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:03,064
Rifki's lying. He's a liar!

558
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:20,206
Rifki!

559
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:45,262
Please, listen to me.

560
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:43,422
Excuse me, I've been wanting
to speak to you. You're an American?

561
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:47,926
Yes, America. My name is Ahmet.

562
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:51,054
I studied philosophy at Harvard
many, many years...

563
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:53,724
though Oxford
is my real alma mater.

564
01:36:53,892 --> 01:36:59,021
I also studied in Vienna,
and now I study here.

565
01:36:59,189 --> 01:37:02,232
They put me here.
They say I raped a little child.

566
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,901
I've been here a very, very long time.

567
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:08,405
They'll never let me go.
They won't let you go, either.

568
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:11,909
They tell you they'll let you go,
but in fact you stay.

569
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,952
You'll never go from here.

570
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:20,250
You see, we all of us
come from a factory.

571
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:25,380
Sometimes the factory makes
bad machines that don't work.

572
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:27,799
The bad machines
don't know they're bad machines.

573
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:29,968
But the people at the factory know.

574
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:34,640
They know that you are one
of the machines that doesn't work.

575
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:42,272
I think we've spoken enough
for today.

576
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,275
I wish you goodnight.

577
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:30,839
My God!

578
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:37,554
Billy!

579
01:39:41,351 --> 01:39:45,562
What have they done to you?

580
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:54,738
Your family is fine.

581
01:39:56,574 --> 01:40:01,286
Senator Buckley has made
a special plea on your behalf.

582
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:06,208
They've called you a pawn in the
game between Nixon and the Turks.

583
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:10,671
The letters are coming in.
People do care.

584
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:18,845
What?

585
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,475
Take it off.

586
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:29,690
- You'll just make yourself...
- Take it off.

587
01:41:10,982 --> 01:41:13,400
Billy...

588
01:41:17,155 --> 01:41:23,744
I wish I could make it better
for you. Please, don't.

589
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,665
Don't.

590
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:47,017
- Susan.
- Yes, Billy.

591
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:52,022
- I love you.
- Oh, Billy.

592
01:41:56,486 --> 01:42:00,030
I love you.

593
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:11,374
Your father gave me this for you.

594
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:16,546
There's pictures of your mom
and dad, and Rob and Peg.

595
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:22,427
And in the back there's a picture
of your old friend Mr. Franklin.

596
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:27,224
Remember him? From the bank.

597
01:42:28,935 --> 01:42:33,897
He's over in Greece now.
He bought a ticket.

598
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:38,735
I'll give it to them for you.

599
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:48,245
Don't count on them.
Don't count on anyone but yourself.

600
01:42:57,088 --> 01:43:01,591
You're running out of time.
If you stay here, you'll die.

601
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:07,931
You've got to get yourself together.
You've got to get out of here.

602
01:44:48,491 --> 01:44:52,035
Good morning, my American friend.

603
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:55,246
There will be trouble
if you go this way.

604
01:44:57,083 --> 01:45:00,126
A good Turk
always walks to the right.

605
01:45:01,337 --> 01:45:04,339
Left is Communist.
Right is good.

606
01:45:09,095 --> 01:45:13,890
You must go the other way.

607
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:16,768
The other way is good.

608
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:23,942
Where are you going?
Why don't you walk the wheel?

609
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:27,237
What is the matter,
my American friend?

610
01:45:27,405 --> 01:45:29,072
What has upset you?

611
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:37,038
A bad machine
doesn't know he's bad machine.

612
01:45:37,206 --> 01:45:43,086
You still don't believe
you're a bad machine?

613
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:46,381
To know yourself is to know God.

614
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:49,259
The factory knows,
that's why they put you here.

615
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:50,969
You'll find out.

616
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:57,434
- In time you'll know.
- I already know.

617
01:45:57,601 --> 01:46:03,606
You are a bad machine, that's why
the factory keeps you here.

618
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:06,651
Do you know how I know?

619
01:46:06,819 --> 01:46:11,614
I know because I'm from the factory.

620
01:46:11,991 --> 01:46:13,658
I make the machines.

621
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,441
Max.

622
01:48:52,443 --> 01:48:54,611
Max!

623
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:57,739
Max!

624
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:05,163
I'm going away.

625
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:09,459
I've come to say goodbye.

626
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:15,965
You see, if I stay here,
I'm going to die.

627
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:21,304
You'll die. Don't die, Max.

628
01:49:21,472 --> 01:49:25,308
Please, don't die.

629
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:28,978
I'm going to come back for you.

630
01:49:29,146 --> 01:49:33,066
You hang on for me.

631
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:33,603
You're not taking me to the sanatorium!
You're not taking me to the sanatorium!

632
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:24,333
Hey!
