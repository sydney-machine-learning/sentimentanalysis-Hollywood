1
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:05,823
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,700
Jimmy?

3
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:09,827
- What's up?
- Did I hit something?

4
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,578
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:14,249
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,085
No.

7
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:20,964
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:50,451
He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit!

9
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,371
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!

10
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:06,801
<i>As far back as I can remember,</i>
<i>I always wanted to be a gangster.</i>

11
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:47,884
<i>To me...</i>

12
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:52,388
<i>being a gangster was better than</i>
<i>being president of the United States.</i>

13
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:59,145
<i>Even before I first wandered</i>
<i>into the cabstand for an after-school job...</i>

14
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,397
<i>I knew I wanted to be a part of them.</i>

15
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,983
<i>It was there that I knew I belonged.</i>

16
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:08,655
<i>To me, it meant being somebody</i>
<i>in a neighborhood full of nobodies.</i>

17
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:11,866
<i>They weren't like anybody else.</i>
<i>They did whatever they wanted.</i>

18
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,662
<i>They double-parked in front of a hydrant,</i>
<i>nobody ever gave them a ticket.</i>

19
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:18,164
<i>In the summer,</i>
<i>when they played cards all night...</i>

20
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,375
<i>nobody ever called the cops.</i>

21
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:34,430
Tony Stacks. How are you?

22
00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:37,267
<i>Tuddy Cicero.</i>

23
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,644
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

24
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,813
- How are you?
- Good.

25
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,274
<i>Tuddy.</i>

26
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:48,319
<i>Tuddy ran the cabstand</i>
<i>and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...</i>

27
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:53,074
<i>and other places for his brother, Paul,</i>
<i>who was the boss of the neighborhood.</i>

28
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:59,956
<i>Paulie might have moved slow...</i>

29
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:06,421
<i>but it was only because Paulie</i>
<i>didn't have to move for anybody.</i>

30
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,760
- It's your fault.
- You started it.

31
00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:14,929
I started it? It's your fault.

32
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:19,475
<i>At first my parents loved that I found</i>
<i>a job across the street from the house.</i>

33
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:24,355
<i>My father, who was Irish,</i>
<i>was sent to work at the age of 11.</i>

34
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:26,524
<i>He liked that I got myself a job.</i>

35
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:30,153
<i>He always used to say</i>
<i>that American kids were spoiled lazy.</i>

36
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:33,615
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

37
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,450
See you, Mikey.

38
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:36,826
Bye, Henry.

39
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,995
Henry! Watch how you cross!

40
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,580
Bring back milk!

41
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:43,875
<i>My mother was happy after</i>
<i>she found out that the Ciceros...</i>

42
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,587
<i>came from the same part of Sicily</i>
<i>as she did. To my mother...</i>

43
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,465
<i>that was the answer to all her prayers.</i>

44
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,469
<i>I was the luckiest kid in the world.</i>

45
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:57,472
<i>I could go anywhere, I could do anything.</i>

46
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:00,225
<i>I knew everybody,</i>
<i>and everybody knew me.</i>

47
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:03,520
<i>Wiseguys would pull up</i>
<i>and Tuddy would toss me their keys...</i>

48
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,438
<i>and let me park their Cadillacs.</i>

49
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:09,192
<i>Here I am, this little kid,</i>
<i>I can't even see over the steering wheel...</i>

50
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,486
<i>and I'm parking Cadillacs.</i>

51
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,824
<i>But it wasn't too long...</i>

52
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:20,828
<i>before my parents changed</i>
<i>their minds about my job at the cabstand.</i>

53
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:22,497
For your mother and sister.

54
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,167
<i>For them, the cabstand was supposed</i>
<i>to be a part-time job. But for me...</i>

55
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:28,336
<i>it was definitely full-time.</i>

56
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,421
<i>That's all I wanted to do.</i>

57
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:34,759
<i>People like my father could never</i>
<i>understand, but I was a part of something.</i>

58
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:37,679
<i>I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.</i>

59
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:39,973
Tell him 519.

60
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,225
<i>Every day I was learning to score.</i>

61
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,853
<i>A dollar here, a dollar there.</i>

62
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:46,896
<i>I was living in a fantasy.</i>

63
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,025
Did you have a good day at school?

64
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:53,027
<i>My father was always pissed off.</i>

65
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:55,321
<i>Pissed that he made such lousy money...</i>

66
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:58,408
<i>pissed that my kid brother Michael</i>
<i>was in a wheelchair.</i>

67
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,745
<i>He was pissed that there were seven of us</i>
<i>living in such a tiny house.</i>

68
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,873
Tell me about this.

69
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,333
It's a letter from school.

70
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:10,670
It says you haven't been there in months.

71
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,256
In months!

72
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:16,509
You're a bum!

73
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,803
Want to grow up to be a bum?

74
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:24,559
<i>After a while, he was mostly pissed</i>
<i>because I hung around the cabstand.</i>

75
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:26,644
<i>He knew what went on at that cabstand.</i>

76
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:31,399
<i>Every once in a while, I'd have to take</i>
<i>a beating. But by then, I didn't care.</i>

77
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,401
<i>The way I saw it...</i>

78
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:36,404
<i>everybody takes a beating sometime.</i>

79
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:41,409
- I can't make any more deliveries.
- What? You'll fuck everything up.

80
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:43,620
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

81
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,163
Come on with me.

82
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:47,332
- Is that him, kid?
- No.

83
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,751
- How about him?
- No.

84
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:53,755
- That's the guy.
- Get him.

85
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,925
Excuse me.

86
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,762
- Scumbag.
- Come here, you piece of shit.

87
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,730
- Know this kid?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:12,440
- Know where he lives?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:14,859
- You deliver mail to his house?
- Yeah.

90
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,780
From now on, any letter from that school
to his house comes directly here.

91
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:20,073
- Understand?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,951
Another letter from that school
goes to that kid's house...

93
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:25,620
in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.

94
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:30,083
<i>That was it. No more letters from</i>
<i>truant officers. No letters from school.</i>

95
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,293
<i>In fact, no more letters from anybody.</i>

96
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:36,089
<i>Finally after a few weeks, my mother</i>
<i>went to the post office to complain.</i>

97
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,258
<i>How could I go to school after that...</i>

98
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:42,512
<i>and pledge allegiance to the flag</i>
<i>and sit through good government bullshit?</i>

99
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,810
<i>Paulie hated phones.</i>
<i>He wouldn't have one in his house.</i>

100
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:51,604
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

101
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,648
All right, make the call.

102
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:57,443
<i>He got all his calls second hand.</i>
<i>Then you'd have to call the people back...</i>

103
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:58,611
<i>from an outside phone.</i>

104
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:01,197
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

105
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:06,703
<i>There were guys, that's all they did</i>
<i>all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.</i>

106
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:20,717
<i>For a guy who moved all day long,</i>
<i>Paulie didn't talk to six people.</i>

107
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,887
<i>If there was a union problem</i>
<i>or, say, a beef in the numbers...</i>

108
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,515
<i>only the top guys could meet</i>
<i>with Paulie to discuss the problem.</i>

109
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,894
<i>Everything was one-on-one.</i>
<i>Paulie hated conferences.</i>

110
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,147
<i>He didn't want anybody</i>
<i>hearing what he said...</i>

111
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,650
<i>and he didn't want anybody listening</i>
<i>to what he was being told.</i>

112
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:42,030
<i>Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,</i>
<i>he got a piece of everything they made.</i>

113
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:46,534
<i>It was a tribute, like in the old country,</i>
<i>except they were doing it in America.</i>

114
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:51,164
<i>All they got from Paulie was protection</i>
<i>from other guys looking to rip them off.</i>

115
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:55,210
<i>That's what it's all about. That's what</i>
<i>the FBI could never understand.</i>

116
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,879
<i>What Paulie and the Organization does...</i>

117
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:01,925
<i>is offer protection for people</i>
<i>who can't go to the cops. That's it.</i>

118
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:06,638
<i>That's all it is. They're like</i>
<i>the police department for wiseguys.</i>

119
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:20,568
<i>People looked at me differently,</i>
<i>and they knew I was with somebody.</i>

120
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,906
<i>I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery</i>
<i>on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.</i>

121
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:26,449
<i>The owner knew who I was with...</i>

122
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:30,203
<i>and he'd come from around the counter.</i>
<i>No matter how many were waiting...</i>

123
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:32,288
<i>I was taken care of first.</i>

124
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,958
<i>Our neighbors didn't park</i>
<i>in our driveway anymore...</i>

125
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,710
<i>even though we didn't have a car. At 13...</i>

126
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,755
<i>I was making more money than most</i>
<i>of the grown-ups around.</i>

127
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,008
<i>I had more money than I could spend.</i>
<i>I had it all.</i>

128
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:58,898
<i>One day, some neighborhood kids carried</i>
<i>my mother's groceries all the way home.</i>

129
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,400
<i>You know why?</i>

130
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,069
<i>It was out of respect.</i>

131
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:06,906
Hi, Mom, what do you think?

132
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:11,244
- Look at my shoes, aren't they great?
- My God.

133
00:10:11,786 --> 00:10:13,413
You look like a gangster.

134
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,248
They shot me. Help!

135
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,586
Henry, shut the door.

136
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,882
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>I had ever seen anyone shot.</i>

137
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:26,885
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

138
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:28,970
I can't have that in this joint.

139
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:30,847
<i>I remember feeling bad about the guy...</i>

140
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,100
<i>but I also remember feeling</i>
<i>that maybe Tuddy was right.</i>

141
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,103
<i>I knew Paulie didn't want</i>
<i>anybody dying in the building.</i>

142
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:41,065
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

143
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:44,444
What the hell's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

144
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,007
<i>It was a glorious time.</i>

145
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,552
<i>And wiseguys were all over the place.</i>

146
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,515
<i>It was before Apalachin</i>
<i>and before Crazy Joe...</i>

147
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:16,518
<i>decided to take on a boss and start a war.</i>

148
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:19,312
<i>It was when I met the world.</i>

149
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:22,148
<i>And it was when I first met</i>
<i>Jimmy Conway.</i>

150
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:26,819
<i>He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29</i>
<i>at the time...</i>

151
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,905
<i>but he was already a legend.</i>

152
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:33,076
<i>He'd walk in the door and everybody</i>
<i>who worked the room just went wild.</i>

153
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,828
<i>He'd give the doorman $100</i>
<i>just for opening the door.</i>

154
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:39,916
<i>He'd give hundreds to the dealers</i>
<i>and the guys who ran the games.</i>

155
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,044
<i>The bartender got $100</i>
<i>just for keeping the ice cubes cold.</i>

156
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:46,214
The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

157
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:52,178
- Want a drink?
- Give me a 7 and 7.

158
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,689
- I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
- How you doing?

159
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,861
- Thank you.
- Keep them coming.

160
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:11,030
<i>Jimmy was one of the most</i>
<i>feared guys in the city.</i>

161
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:12,824
<i>He was first locked up at 11...</i>

162
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:16,077
<i>and he was doing hits</i>
<i>for mob bosses when he was 16.</i>

163
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,997
<i>See, hits never bothered Jimmy.</i>
<i>It was business.</i>

164
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:21,583
<i>But what Jimmy really loved to do...</i>

165
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,751
<i>what he really loved to do was steal.</i>

166
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:26,129
<i>He actually enjoyed it.</i>

167
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,175
<i>Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted</i>
<i>for the bad guys in the movies.</i>

168
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,635
Give me your wallet.

169
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:38,808
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are. Understand?

170
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,394
<i>He was one of</i>
<i>the city's biggest hijackers...</i>

171
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:45,148
<i>of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,</i>
<i>shrimp and lobsters.</i>

172
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,234
<i>Shrimp and lobsters were best.</i>
<i>They went really fast.</i>

173
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:52,280
<i>Almost all of them were gimmies.</i>
<i>They just gave it up, no problem.</i>

174
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:54,115
<i>They called him Jimmy the Gent.</i>

175
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,408
Help the lady.

176
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,619
<i>Drivers loved him.</i>
<i>They used to tip him off...</i>

177
00:12:57,702 --> 00:13:01,372
<i>about the really good loads.</i>
<i>Of course, everybody got a piece.</i>

178
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,625
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

179
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,251
Okay, see you later.

180
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,339
Henry, come here.

181
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,342
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How're you doing, Henry?

182
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,511
You're gonna be working together, okay?

183
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,346
Help him. Go ahead.

184
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:18,890
Jimmy, you got anything good?

185
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:23,228
<i>And when the cops assigned a whole</i>
<i>army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?</i>

186
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:24,437
How're you doing?

187
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,356
<i>He made them partners.</i>

188
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,066
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

189
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:30,068
- One Pall Mall.
- There you go.

190
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:32,362
- What do you need?
- Two Luckies.

191
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,405
- Here you go, Henry.
- Thanks a lot.

192
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:35,615
What do you need?

193
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,451
- One Pall Mall.
- One Pall Mall, here you go.

194
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,245
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

195
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:43,581
- You have permission from your mother?
- How many cartons you need?

196
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:46,626
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

197
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,545
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

198
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,923
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.

199
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:58,638
- Henry got pinched.
- Where?

200
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:00,598
By the factory, selling cigarettes.

201
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:04,561
Henry Hill. <i>The People of</i>
<i>the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.</i>

202
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,647
Docket number 704162.

203
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:10,984
Yes, sir. That's me.

204
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,573
Just stand there. Now stay there.

205
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,706
Counselor, proceed.

206
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,502
Congratulations.

207
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,796
Here's your graduation present.

208
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,924
- What for? I got pinched.
- Everyone does, but you did it right.

209
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,177
You told them nothing,
and they got nothing.

210
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,471
- I thought you'd be mad.
- I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

211
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:44,934
You took your first pinch like a man
and learned the two greatest things in life.

212
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,353
- What?
- Look at me.

213
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,231
Never rat on your friends...

214
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,692
and always keep your mouth shut.

215
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,197
Here he is.

216
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,574
You broke your cherry.

217
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,333
Congratulations!

218
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:46,287
<i>By the time I grew up,</i>
<i>there was $30 billion a year in cargo...</i>

219
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,206
<i>moving through Idlewild Airport...</i>

220
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:51,417
<i>and believe me,</i>
<i>we tried to steal every bit of it.</i>

221
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,379
<i>See, you gotta understand,</i>
<i>we grew up near the airport.</i>

222
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,089
<i>It belonged to Paulie.</i>

223
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,967
<i>We had friends and relatives</i>
<i>who worked all over the place.</i>

224
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,846
<i>They would tip us off about</i>
<i>what was coming in and moving out.</i>

225
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:06,140
<i>If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...</i>

226
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:10,395
<i>Paulie had the union people scare them</i>
<i>with a strike. It was beautiful.</i>

227
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:14,357
<i>It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers</i>
<i>and Jimmy was in charge of it all.</i>

228
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,318
<i>Whenever we needed money,</i>
<i>we'd rob the airport.</i>

229
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:19,904
<i>To us, it was better than Citibank.</i>

230
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,418
You got a phone? Come on!

231
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:37,255
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you believe that shit?

232
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:43,928
<i>There was Jimmy...</i>

233
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:45,805
<i>and Tommy and me.</i>

234
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,807
<i>And there was Anthony Stabile.</i>

235
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:49,475
How're you doing?

236
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,186
<i>Frankie Carbone.</i>

237
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:56,357
<i>And then there was Mo Black's brother,</i>
<i>Fat Andy.</i>

238
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:59,444
<i>And his guys, Frankie the Wop.</i>

239
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:03,281
<i>Freddy No Nose.</i>

240
00:17:04,782 --> 00:17:08,786
<i>And then there was Pete the Killer,</i>
<i>who was Sally Balls'brother.</i>

241
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:13,041
<i>Then you had Nickey Eyes...</i>

242
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,127
<i>and Mikey Franzese.</i>

243
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:17,712
That guy, I wanna see him.

244
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:21,508
<i>Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname</i>
<i>because he said everything twice.</i>

245
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:24,219
I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

246
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:40,026
What is this? Coats?
Henry, I need suits, not coats.

247
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,070
Suits are coming Thursday.

248
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:45,156
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

249
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,450
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

250
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:51,996
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat. How's that?

251
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,749
<i>For us, to live any other way was nuts.</i>

252
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:59,254
<i>To us, those goody-good people who</i>
<i>worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...</i>

253
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:03,424
<i>and took the subway to work every day</i>
<i>and worried about bills, were dead.</i>

254
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:06,344
<i>They were suckers. They had no balls.</i>

255
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,097
<i>If we wanted something, we just took it.</i>

256
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,726
<i>If anyone complained twice, they got hit</i>
<i>so bad they never complained again.</i>

257
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,355
<i>It was just all routine.</i>
<i>You didn't even think about it.</i>

258
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:23,027
Frankie, what the fuck does 520
have to do with 469?

259
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:24,571
I can't believe this guy.

260
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:28,658
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

261
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:33,705
Piece of cake. It's all there.

262
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:37,166
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just gotta find a way to get the key.

263
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,794
- No problem, right?
- I'll take care of it.

264
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:50,722
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.

265
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:55,393
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

266
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:59,105
Tourists and American servicemen
change their money...

267
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:01,232
into French money and send it back here.

268
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:03,401
- Calm down.
- It's beautiful.

269
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:07,113
It's totally untraceable. Okay?

270
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:09,949
The only problem is getting a key,
but I've got a plan.

271
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:13,494
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
- Yeah, he's a piece of work.

272
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:17,457
If I'm right, there could be
$500,000 coming in, all cash.

273
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,337
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

274
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,506
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

275
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:27,008
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.

276
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:29,010
What about the security?

277
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:30,345
Security?

278
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:33,806
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

279
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,433
I'm the commandant.

280
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:38,436
He just comes in
like he's picking up lost baggage.

281
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,105
- It's beautiful.
- It won't be a problem at all.

282
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:42,690
- Good.
- We're on.

283
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:47,487
What's really funny is
that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

284
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,614
I'm in the middle of the weeds,
lying down.

285
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:52,158
He says, "What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm resting."

286
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:55,620
"Here? This ain't no beach or park."
I said, "I'm resting."

287
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,205
I know I'm resting.

288
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:00,667
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

289
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,795
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing.

290
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:08,258
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

291
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,885
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

292
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:18,476
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

293
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,730
Now I'm coming around,
and who do I see in front of me?

294
00:20:22,814 --> 00:20:26,568
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

295
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:30,655
I said, "What are you doing here?
I told you to go fuck your mother."

296
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:33,783
I thought he was gonna shit.

297
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,913
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

298
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:45,253
Funny. You're really funny.

299
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,506
What do you mean, I'm funny?

300
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,885
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

301
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,678
You're a funny guy.

302
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,931
You mean the way I talk? What?

303
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:00,476
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

304
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,980
You know, the way
you tell the story and everything.

305
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,441
Funny how? What's funny about it?

306
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:09,903
- Tommy, you got it all wrong.
- Anthony.

307
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:12,655
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
What did you say?

308
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,032
Funny, how?

309
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,745
Just, you know. You're funny.

310
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:21,080
Let me understand this.

311
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,374
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

312
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,836
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

313
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:30,215
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

314
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:33,009
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

315
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:38,765
You know, how you tell a story.

316
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:42,769
No, I don't know. You said it.
How do I know? You said I'm funny.

317
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:46,397
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

318
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:48,316
Tell me what's funny.

319
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:55,907
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

320
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,160
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

321
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,330
You stuttering prick, you!

322
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:04,374
Frankie, was he shaking?

323
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:09,254
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.

324
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:14,968
Jesus Christ.

325
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:18,763
What the fuck is it with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

326
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:22,267
He's hanging on my fucking neck
like a vulture. What do you want?

327
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,603
This guy didn't want to come
and give you the check.

328
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,772
Could you take care of this?

329
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:30,775
No problem. Tell him to put it
on my tab. Of course.

330
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,819
That's what I want to talk to you about.

331
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:36,364
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

332
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:40,410
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...

333
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,620
Don't mean to be out of order?

334
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:44,873
It's good you don't mean
to be out of order.

335
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:48,668
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

336
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,795
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.

337
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:52,922
You know the money
we spend in this fucking...

338
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:55,383
- Don't be like that.
- What do you mean?

339
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:05,226
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?

340
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:11,900
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

341
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,652
You don't want to bring the check?

342
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,323
Do you believe this prick?

343
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:23,953
You're supposed
to be doing this stuff, too.

344
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,747
You're a funny guy.

345
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:28,791
- That's it, Henry.
- No, go back.

346
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:34,631
You want to laugh? This prick last week
asked me to christen his kid.

347
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:37,509
I charged him $7,000.

348
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,597
You really are a funny guy.

349
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:49,646
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds
of fucking bad things.

350
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:51,773
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

351
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:55,485
I got to go on the lam
in order to get away from this guy.

352
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:58,655
This ain't right. I can't go here,
I can't go there.

353
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:02,158
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them, they don't listen.

354
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:06,246
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

355
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:09,374
They'll find me in the back of a car
somewhere in the weeds.

356
00:24:09,457 --> 00:24:12,126
You've known this Tommy all your life.
Who knows better?

357
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,795
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

358
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:17,590
When I leave my house, before I get
to the car I look over both shoulders.

359
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:20,134
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.

360
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:22,679
I'm around you all my life,
tell me what I gotta do.

361
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:25,640
- Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do.
- What could I do?

362
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:29,853
If there was something I could do, I would.
I would like to help you out.

363
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:32,689
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

364
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:35,066
- You think it's all right?
- Yeah.

365
00:24:37,735 --> 00:24:41,531
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

366
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:44,659
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?

367
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:47,579
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

368
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:50,790
You've been in there a million times.
You know how it looks.

369
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:54,711
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

370
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:57,881
I don't mean no disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

371
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:01,384
I know you're his friend.
I'm begging you. What can I say?

372
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:05,054
What am I gonna do?
What do you want from me?

373
00:25:05,388 --> 00:25:08,933
I don't know anything
about the restaurant business. Nothing.

374
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:12,645
All I know is to sit down and order a meal,
not how to make a restaurant.

375
00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:15,064
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

376
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:18,818
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

377
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:22,071
I'd love to help you, but what do you want
from me? What'll I do?

378
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:25,491
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

379
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:27,577
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

380
00:25:32,582 --> 00:25:36,961
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
I just mean that he's scaring me.

381
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:39,631
I just need help. Help me, please.

382
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:42,926
You know anything about
this restaurant business?

383
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,929
He knows everything.
He's there 24 hours a day.

384
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,765
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

385
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,475
That's how often he's in there.

386
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,395
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?

387
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:58,024
What the fuck you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please. Come on.

388
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:00,109
It's not even fair.

389
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:01,945
You don't understand.

390
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:05,573
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.

391
00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:09,827
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.
You've always been fair with me.

392
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:13,873
<i>Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.</i>
<i>Any problems, he goes to Paulie.</i>

393
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:16,125
<i>Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.</i>

394
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,461
<i>Trouble with the cops,</i>
<i>deliveries, Tommy...</i>

395
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:19,838
<i>he can call Paulie.</i>

396
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:22,882
<i>Now the guy's gotta come up</i>
<i>with Paulie's money every week...</i>

397
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:24,133
<i>no matter what.</i>

398
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:28,346
<i>"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.</i>
<i>Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.</i>

399
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:31,307
<i>"The place got hit by lightning?</i>
<i>Fuck you, pay me. "</i>

400
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,643
Can I get one of those TVs?

401
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,478
<i>Also, Paulie could do anything.</i>

402
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:38,690
<i>Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.</i>
<i>And why not?</i>

403
00:26:38,773 --> 00:26:40,817
<i>Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.</i>

404
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,986
<i>When deliveries are made</i>
<i>at the front door...</i>

405
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,822
<i>you move the stuff out the back</i>
<i>and sell it at a discount.</i>

406
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:49,200
<i>You take a $200 case of booze</i>
<i>and sell it for $100.</i>

407
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,953
<i>It doesn't matter. It's all profit.</i>

408
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:56,332
<i>Then finally, when there's nothing left...</i>

409
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:57,500
Fucking shame.

410
00:26:57,584 --> 00:27:01,796
<i>... when you can't borrow another buck</i>
<i>or buy another case of booze...</i>

411
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,674
<i>you bust the joint out. You light a match.</i>

412
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,342
Do you need help reaching anything?

413
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,845
You look like
you're decorating a Christmas tree.

414
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,181
You don't know what you're doing.

415
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:15,935
She's from the Five Towns.

416
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:17,729
Who?

417
00:27:18,313 --> 00:27:21,649
The Jew broad, Diane,
I was telling you I'm going to shag.

418
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,819
I've been trying to bang her
for a fucking month now.

419
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:27,197
She won't go out with me alone.

420
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,365
- No.
- No, what?

421
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:32,702
No, what? Who the fuck
asked you anything?

422
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,829
I didn't ask you.
Hear what I'm going to say.

423
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:36,498
All right, what?

424
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,208
Okay, what.

425
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:41,085
She don't want to go out
with Italians alone.

426
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:43,463
She's prejudiced against Italians.

427
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:46,049
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?

428
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:48,718
What the fuck is this world coming to?

429
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:53,556
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

430
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,935
She won't go out with me alone
unless her girlfriend comes with us.

431
00:27:57,018 --> 00:27:59,145
So you come along,
go out with her girlfriend.

432
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,147
See? I knew it.

433
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,650
You knew what?
What the fuck is wrong with that?

434
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,818
- When is this?
- Tomorrow night.

435
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:07,529
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.

436
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:10,406
You could meet Tuddy.
You can come early and then still go.

437
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,951
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.

438
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:15,578
What did I ask you for?
I'm asking you for a favor.

439
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,539
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

440
00:28:17,622 --> 00:28:20,625
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad.
Help me out.

441
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:24,796
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

442
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:28,049
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

443
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:32,512
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

444
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:35,723
You with your fucking mouth.

445
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:44,566
<i>I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00,</i>
<i>and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.</i>

446
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:47,360
How about it?
Did you have enough to eat?

447
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:50,071
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

448
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:51,573
Let me watch your figure.

449
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:53,283
<i>I couldn't wait to get away.</i>

450
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,994
<i>I was ordering the dessert</i>
<i>when they were eating dinner.</i>

451
00:28:56,077 --> 00:28:58,663
<i>When they were having coffee,</i>
<i>I was asking for a check.</i>

452
00:28:58,746 --> 00:28:59,998
<i>I had business.</i>

453
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:02,625
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

454
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,963
- Can we have the check?
- What are you doing?

455
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,257
- I got to go.
- We just got here.

456
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,342
I got that thing. I gotta go.

457
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,720
Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll leave together.

458
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:17,640
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

459
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:20,018
<i>I couldn't stand him.</i>

460
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,604
<i>I thought he was really obnoxious.</i>

461
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:24,731
<i>He kept fidgeting around.</i>

462
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:28,651
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

463
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:35,450
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

464
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:39,829
- Ready?
- Henry, lighten up.

465
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:42,165
We just got here. What are you doing?

466
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:46,628
<i>Before it was time to go home,</i>
<i>he was pushing me into the car...</i>

467
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:50,048
<i>then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.</i>

468
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:53,009
<i>Diane and Tommy made us promise...</i>

469
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,094
<i>to meet them again on Friday night.</i>

470
00:29:55,178 --> 00:29:56,387
<i>We agreed.</i>

471
00:29:56,471 --> 00:30:00,225
<i>Of course, when Friday night came around,</i>
<i>Henry stood me up.</i>

472
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:03,144
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

473
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:06,731
He really liked you, too.
All he did was talk about her.

474
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:09,359
<i>We were a trio</i>
<i>instead of a double date that night.</i>

475
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:12,362
He would have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

476
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:15,198
<i>But I made Tommy take me</i>
<i>looking for him.</i>

477
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,371
Tommy, what the fuck?

478
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:24,332
You got some nerve standing me up.

479
00:30:24,415 --> 00:30:25,875
Nobody does that to me.

480
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:29,671
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

481
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:33,758
Slow down, I forgot.
I thought it was next week.

482
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:37,136
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

483
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:40,139
We can talk about this. Take it easy.

484
00:30:40,223 --> 00:30:41,724
Talk about it?

485
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:44,894
Talk to you after what
you just did to me? Forget it.

486
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:49,190
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

487
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:50,775
What do you expect?

488
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:54,571
Let me make it up to you.

489
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:56,072
I'll think about it.

490
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:59,784
<i>I remember, she was screaming</i>
<i>on the street, and I mean loud.</i>

491
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:01,202
<i>But she looked good.</i>

492
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:04,581
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

493
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:07,375
<i>She had these great eyes</i>
<i>just like Liz Taylor's.</i>

494
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,544
<i>At least that's what I thought.</i>

495
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,088
Hello, Henry.

496
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:13,590
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

497
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:14,757
Come on.

498
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:16,593
- No, wait a minute.
- What?

499
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:19,721
Quick, you have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...

500
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:21,055
Karen.

501
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:22,682
Mom.

502
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:25,768
- I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill.
- How do you do?

503
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:29,355
- Nice to meet you.
- My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

504
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,233
It's just the good half.

505
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:35,153
- Thank you, sir.
- Bye, see you later, thanks.

506
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:37,572
What're you doing?
You're leaving your car?

507
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:39,407
He watches the car for me.

508
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,327
It's easier than leaving it at a garage
and waiting.

509
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,330
It's a lot quicker that way,
you know what I mean?

510
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:55,798
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

511
00:32:00,261 --> 00:32:03,848
How are you doing? What's up?
Here you go.

512
00:32:10,146 --> 00:32:12,190
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing all right.

513
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:13,483
Good.

514
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:21,491
Every time I come here,
every time, you two. Don't you work?

515
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:14,669
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

516
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,880
Anthony, right in the front.

517
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:19,257
Anything you need, just let me know.

518
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:40,278
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

519
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:42,697
- How are you guys doing?
- How are you?

520
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:50,914
- You gave them $20 each.
- It's all right.

521
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:53,500
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

522
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:54,959
- Where?
- Over there.

523
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:57,045
Thanks a lot, Tony.

524
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:02,717
- What do you do?
- What?

525
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,386
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.

526
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:09,766
They don't feel like you're in construction.

527
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,643
I'm a union delegate.

528
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:14,646
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

529
00:34:14,729 --> 00:34:19,400
<i>the Copacabana is proud to present</i>
<i>the king of one-liners...</i>

530
00:34:19,484 --> 00:34:21,444
<i>Henny Youngman.</i>

531
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:31,371
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

532
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:35,834
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

533
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:40,922
<i>I said, "Where do you wanna go</i>
<i>for our anniversary?"</i>

534
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:43,049
<i>She said,</i>
<i>"Somewhere I've never been before."</i>

535
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:45,426
<i>I said, "Try the kitchen."</i>

536
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:47,720
<i>Dr. Wellsler is here.</i>

537
00:34:47,804 --> 00:34:50,932
<i>Gave a guy six months to live.</i>
<i>Couldn't pay his bill.</i>

538
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:53,101
<i>Gave him another six months.</i>

539
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:56,980
<i>I love this crowd.</i>

540
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:13,413
<i>Air France made me.</i>

541
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:17,333
<i>We walked out with $420,000</i>
<i>without using a gun.</i>

542
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:21,004
<i>And we did the right thing.</i>
<i>We gave Paulie his tribute.</i>

543
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,302
$60,000.

544
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:29,554
It's going to be a good summer.

545
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,352
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

546
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:40,481
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps, all right?

547
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:41,941
All right.

548
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:44,986
Check, sir.

549
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:49,908
No. You have to sign for it here.

550
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:53,244
Should I tip him?

551
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:03,880
- How are you doing?
- Okay. How are you?

552
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:08,051
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.

553
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:10,762
Good to meet you.

554
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,723
I'll see you around later.

555
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:20,396
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

556
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,315
He lives across the street.

557
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:52,220
<i>One night, Bobby Vinton sent us</i>
<i>champagne. There was nothing like it.</i>

558
00:36:52,512 --> 00:36:56,391
<i>I didn't think there was</i>
<i>anything strange in any of this.</i>

559
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:59,435
<i>A 21-year-old kid with such connections.</i>

560
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,648
<i>He was an exciting guy.</i>

561
00:37:04,274 --> 00:37:08,278
<i>He was really nice.</i>
<i>He introduced me to everybody.</i>

562
00:37:08,903 --> 00:37:11,406
<i>Everybody wanted to be nice to him.</i>

563
00:37:12,073 --> 00:37:14,158
<i>He knew how to handle it.</i>

564
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,460
<i>Don't buy wigs that come off</i>
<i>at the wrong time.</i>

565
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:27,255
<i>Morrie's wigs don't come off!</i>

566
00:37:27,338 --> 00:37:28,631
<i>Even underwater.</i>

567
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:33,136
<i>And remember, Morrie's wigs</i>
<i>are tested against hurricane winds.</i>

568
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:37,015
<i>Forget about money. You can afford</i>
<i>a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.</i>

569
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:38,474
<i>Call me now!</i>

570
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:42,812
<i>Come in for a personalized fitting.</i>

571
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:49,194
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.

572
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:51,821
You're a good kid.
We've been good to each other.

573
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:54,449
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

574
00:37:54,532 --> 00:37:56,826
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.

575
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,953
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

576
00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:02,665
I never had to pay the vigorish
he demands. Am I something special?

577
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:04,501
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?

578
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:07,128
You know Jimmy.
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

579
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:09,464
I didn't agree to three points
above the vig.

580
00:38:09,547 --> 00:38:12,133
What are you going to do?
Fight with Jimmy Conway?

581
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:14,636
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go.

582
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,803
Fuck him!

583
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:19,307
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

584
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,184
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?

585
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:24,020
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

586
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:27,357
You're talking crazy. Stop it now, will you?

587
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,735
You got money
for that fucking commercial.

588
00:38:30,818 --> 00:38:33,279
You don't got my money?

589
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:35,323
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

590
00:38:35,406 --> 00:38:38,952
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the money, cocksucker.

591
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:40,703
Pay me my money.

592
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:42,413
He'll pay.

593
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:46,292
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.

594
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,379
- Jimmy, I'm sorry.
- You should be sorry.

595
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:52,757
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

596
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:55,885
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.

597
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:59,681
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

598
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:01,933
Karen, slow down.

599
00:39:03,017 --> 00:39:05,270
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

600
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,565
- What happened?
- It's Karen, Jimmy.

601
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:11,109
- Money today.
- I'll pay.

602
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:23,204
What happened?

603
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:25,665
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

604
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:27,250
Who did it?

605
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:31,754
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

606
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:39,846
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.

607
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:42,724
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

608
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:46,686
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

609
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:51,024
He pushed me out of the car.

610
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,783
You sure you're all right?

611
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:07,540
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

612
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:31,064
What do you want, fucko?
You want something?

613
00:40:37,695 --> 00:40:41,783
I swear on my fucking mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

614
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:44,911
Don't shoot.

615
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:08,059
- Hide this. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

616
00:41:12,188 --> 00:41:15,108
<i>I know there are women,</i>
<i>like my best friends...</i>

617
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:17,902
<i>who would have gotten out</i>
<i>the minute their boyfriend...</i>

618
00:41:17,986 --> 00:41:20,905
<i>gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.</i>

619
00:41:21,823 --> 00:41:24,742
<i>I've got to admit the truth.</i>
<i>It turned me on.</i>

620
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:32,500
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

621
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:08,995
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

622
00:42:09,204 --> 00:42:12,332
He's settling down now. He's married.

623
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:14,834
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

624
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:18,505
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

625
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:28,765
<i>It was like he had two families.</i>

626
00:42:28,973 --> 00:42:33,186
<i>The first time I was introduced</i>
<i>to all of them at once, it was crazy.</i>

627
00:42:33,436 --> 00:42:36,814
<i>Paulie and his brothers had lots</i>
<i>of sons and nephews.</i>

628
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:40,109
<i>Almost all of them</i>
<i>were named Peter or Paul.</i>

629
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:43,154
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

630
00:42:43,238 --> 00:42:46,616
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

631
00:42:46,908 --> 00:42:49,994
<i>There must have been two dozen</i>
<i>Peters and Pauls at the wedding.</i>

632
00:42:50,078 --> 00:42:51,246
This is Marie.

633
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:54,207
<i>Plus, they were all married</i>
<i>to girls named Marie.</i>

634
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:57,377
- She looks Italian.
- She is Italian, you're right.

635
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,213
<i>And they named all their daughters Marie.</i>

636
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:04,843
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

637
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:09,055
<i>By the time I finished meeting everybody,</i>
<i>I thought I was drunk.</i>

638
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:15,728
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

639
00:43:18,773 --> 00:43:20,483
Welcome to the family.

640
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,068
Sunday dinner?

641
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:24,821
So beautiful. I want to cry.

642
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:28,241
Here's something to help you get started.

643
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:48,636
- The bag. The bag.
- What? What bag?

644
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,639
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

645
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,977
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

646
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:27,967
He didn't call?

647
00:44:28,468 --> 00:44:32,138
- He's with his friends.
- What kind of person doesn't call?

648
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:35,475
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

649
00:44:35,558 --> 00:44:39,145
If he was such a grown-up
why doesn't he get you two an apartment?

650
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:42,649
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

651
00:44:42,774 --> 00:44:46,402
You're here a month and sometimes
I know he doesn't come home at all.

652
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:48,404
What kind of people are these?

653
00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:51,407
- What do you want me to do?
- Do? What can you do?

654
00:44:51,491 --> 00:44:54,369
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?

655
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:56,162
Did you know what they were like?

656
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:59,332
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

657
00:44:59,415 --> 00:45:02,961
Stay out? Daddy never
went out at all, Ma! Keep out of it.

658
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:04,963
You don't know how I feel!

659
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:09,008
How do you feel now? You don't know
where he is or who he's with.

660
00:45:09,092 --> 00:45:11,678
He's with his friends! Dad!

661
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:13,805
Leave him out of this.
He's suffered enough.

662
00:45:13,888 --> 00:45:16,850
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

663
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:29,779
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

664
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:34,534
We were worried to death.
A married man does not stay out like this.

665
00:45:36,536 --> 00:45:39,205
Normal people don't act like this!

666
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:42,417
What's wrong with you?

667
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:46,754
You're not normal. She's right.
What's wrong with you?

668
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:50,133
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

669
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:52,844
What kind of people are they?

670
00:45:55,555 --> 00:45:58,266
<i>We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.</i>

671
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:01,227
<i>But the first time I realized how different...</i>

672
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:03,688
<i>was when Mickey had a hostess party.</i>

673
00:46:04,397 --> 00:46:07,066
- Karen, where you from?
- Lawrence.

674
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,446
On the Island. It's nice.
I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

675
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:15,325
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

676
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:18,244
Angie, stop picking at that thing.

677
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:19,746
I'd like to smack his face.

678
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:21,664
The red-haired guy, looks like a farmer?

679
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:23,791
The guy's hands are all over me.

680
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:28,254
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

681
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:31,341
She means it.

682
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:35,094
You don't know how lucky he is.
I just mention this to Vinnie...

683
00:46:35,261 --> 00:46:38,473
How can you mention it?
Vinnie would kill him.

684
00:46:38,556 --> 00:46:42,519
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable bastard,
then Vinnie will be there for life.

685
00:46:42,602 --> 00:46:45,313
You think you got problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

686
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:49,234
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

687
00:46:49,317 --> 00:46:53,029
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears it...

688
00:46:53,112 --> 00:46:57,283
and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart
attack and drops dead right on the spot.

689
00:46:57,367 --> 00:47:01,788
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

690
00:47:02,622 --> 00:47:05,458
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.

691
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:07,752
Give me a break. She's drunk.

692
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:12,632
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

693
00:47:12,715 --> 00:47:17,637
<i>They had bad skin and wore too much</i>
<i>makeup. They didn't look very good.</i>

694
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:20,682
<i>They looked beat-up.</i>
<i>And the stuff they wore...</i>

695
00:47:20,765 --> 00:47:22,725
<i>was thrown together and cheap.</i>

696
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:25,478
<i>A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.</i>

697
00:47:27,397 --> 00:47:29,190
She spends her life in a nightgown.

698
00:47:29,274 --> 00:47:31,651
The woman is no angel, believe me.

699
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:34,320
<i>They talked about their rotten kids...</i>

700
00:47:34,404 --> 00:47:37,073
<i>and about beating them</i>
<i>with broom handles and belts.</i>

701
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:40,160
<i>And that the kids</i>
<i>still didn't pay any attention.</i>

702
00:47:40,243 --> 00:47:42,245
<i>When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.</i>

703
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:44,998
I don't know if I could live like that.

704
00:47:46,207 --> 00:47:49,711
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

705
00:47:49,919 --> 00:47:51,254
Karen.

706
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:54,007
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

707
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:56,426
Do you know why Jeannie's husband
went to the can?

708
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:59,971
Because of Jeannie.
He wanted to get away from her.

709
00:48:00,054 --> 00:48:04,809
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

710
00:48:05,143 --> 00:48:07,145
Unless they make themselves get caught.

711
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:09,063
They don't have things organized.

712
00:48:09,147 --> 00:48:12,525
I know what I'm doing.
I've got things organized with these guys.

713
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:17,071
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

714
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:20,158
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car, Karen.

715
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:24,120
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

716
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,421
<i>After a while, it got to be all normal.</i>

717
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:36,674
<i>None of it seemed like crime.</i>

718
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:39,135
<i>It was more like Henry was enterprising...</i>

719
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:43,014
<i>and that he and the guys made bucks</i>
<i>hustling while other guys...</i>

720
00:48:43,097 --> 00:48:46,100
<i>were sitting on their asses</i>
<i>waiting for handouts.</i>

721
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:50,939
<i>Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,</i>
<i>they were blue-collar guys.</i>

722
00:48:51,022 --> 00:48:55,610
<i>The only way they could make real extra</i>
<i>money was to go out and cut corners.</i>

723
00:48:56,027 --> 00:48:58,655
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

724
00:49:05,036 --> 00:49:07,413
Don't fucking move! Don't move.

725
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:19,592
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.

726
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:22,428
Did you see him give it right over?

727
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:25,223
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

728
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:31,521
<i>We were all so very close.</i>

729
00:49:31,604 --> 00:49:35,483
<i>There were never any outsiders around.</i>
<i>Absolutely never.</i>

730
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:40,405
<i>Being together all the time made</i>
<i>everything seem all the more normal.</i>

731
00:49:40,488 --> 00:49:41,906
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.

732
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:46,369
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

733
00:49:46,452 --> 00:49:48,538
Would you read and sign it?

734
00:49:48,746 --> 00:49:50,248
- Anywhere?
- Yeah, anywhere.

735
00:49:50,331 --> 00:49:52,959
This'll take a while,
we have to go through everything.

736
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:56,129
- You boys want some coffee?
- No coffee now, thanks.

737
00:49:57,172 --> 00:50:00,383
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.

738
00:50:00,466 --> 00:50:02,927
<i>There was always a little harassment.</i>

739
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:05,889
<i>They wanted to talk to Henry</i>
<i>about this or that.</i>

740
00:50:05,972 --> 00:50:09,309
<i>They'd make me sign</i>
<i>their subpoenas or warrants.</i>

741
00:50:09,392 --> 00:50:11,811
<i>But mostly they just wanted a handout.</i>

742
00:50:11,895 --> 00:50:15,315
<i>A few bucks to keep things quiet</i>
<i>no matter what they found.</i>

743
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:25,492
<i>I always asked if they wanted coffee.</i>
<i>Some wives, like Mickey Conway...</i>

744
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,620
<i>used to curse at them</i>
<i>and spit on the floor.</i>

745
00:50:28,703 --> 00:50:32,373
<i>She used to spit on her own floor.</i>
<i>That never made any sense to me.</i>

746
00:50:32,457 --> 00:50:35,502
<i>It was better to be polite</i>
<i>and call the lawyer.</i>

747
00:50:44,636 --> 00:50:49,182
<i>We always did everything together,</i>
<i>and we always were in the same crowd.</i>

748
00:50:49,265 --> 00:50:53,269
<i>Anniversaries, christenings.</i>
<i>We only went to each other's houses.</i>

749
00:50:55,396 --> 00:50:56,814
<i>The women played cards.</i>

750
00:50:56,898 --> 00:51:01,027
<i>When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy</i>
<i>were the first at the hospital.</i>

751
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,280
<i>When we went to the Islands</i>
<i>or Vegas for vacation...</i>

752
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:05,698
<i>we went together.</i>

753
00:51:05,782 --> 00:51:08,868
<i>No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.</i>

754
00:51:08,993 --> 00:51:12,121
<i>It got to where I was proud</i>
<i>that I had the kind of husband...</i>

755
00:51:12,205 --> 00:51:15,959
<i>who was willing to risk his neck</i>
<i>just to get us the little extras.</i>

756
00:51:16,835 --> 00:51:20,129
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

757
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:22,131
- Can't do it, Karen.
- Why not?

758
00:51:22,215 --> 00:51:24,884
I just can't. I got something lined up.

759
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:28,596
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

760
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,267
- Pretty please?
- I can't. What do you want me to do?

761
00:51:33,685 --> 00:51:35,854
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.

762
00:51:37,021 --> 00:51:39,357
I wanted to go shopping.
Can I get some money?

763
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,192
How much do you need?

764
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:44,863
- How much?
- That much.

765
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:52,537
This much. Give me a kiss.

766
00:51:56,124 --> 00:51:57,750
See you later.

767
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:04,007
All right.

768
00:52:36,247 --> 00:52:38,124
Welcome home, Batts.

769
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:41,628
Hi, how are you?

770
00:52:42,128 --> 00:52:45,423
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

771
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,635
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

772
00:52:48,718 --> 00:52:50,595
There's only one Irishman here.

773
00:52:50,678 --> 00:52:52,764
It's a celebration, fellas.

774
00:52:52,847 --> 00:52:55,975
- Top of the morning to you.
- It's good to be home.

775
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:01,940
This is my friend Jimmy.

776
00:53:02,023 --> 00:53:04,692
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

777
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:07,779
Tommy. All dressed up.

778
00:53:07,862 --> 00:53:10,907
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.

779
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,785
Forgot you were having a party
for this mug.

780
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:16,120
Come here.

781
00:53:16,204 --> 00:53:18,581
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?

782
00:53:18,665 --> 00:53:21,543
Get over here.
I haven't seen you in six years.

783
00:53:21,626 --> 00:53:24,754
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

784
00:53:25,421 --> 00:53:26,798
Watch the suit.

785
00:53:27,298 --> 00:53:30,468
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

786
00:53:30,969 --> 00:53:34,889
- Don't get too big on me.
- Just don't bust my balls.

787
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:39,018
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

788
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:43,022
This kid was great.

789
00:53:43,106 --> 00:53:45,316
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

790
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,529
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

791
00:53:49,612 --> 00:53:53,616
He was terrific. He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.

792
00:53:54,951 --> 00:53:56,578
No more shines, Billy.

793
00:53:57,162 --> 00:53:58,663
- What?
- I said no more shines.

794
00:53:58,746 --> 00:54:01,624
You've been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

795
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,835
I don't shine shoes anymore.

796
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:08,339
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

797
00:54:08,423 --> 00:54:09,841
I'm only kidding with you.

798
00:54:09,924 --> 00:54:13,344
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

799
00:54:13,428 --> 00:54:15,638
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

800
00:54:15,722 --> 00:54:19,517
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

801
00:54:19,601 --> 00:54:21,644
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

802
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:24,105
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.

803
00:54:28,693 --> 00:54:30,862
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

804
00:54:30,945 --> 00:54:32,572
Motherfucking mutt!

805
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:35,074
You fucking piece of shit!

806
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,535
Come on, come on!

807
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:41,498
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

808
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:43,958
You bought your fucking button!

809
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:46,419
- Don't get nervous.
- You motherfucker!

810
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:49,297
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here.

811
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,051
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

812
00:54:53,134 --> 00:54:56,346
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

813
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:58,973
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

814
00:54:59,057 --> 00:55:02,602
Teach this kid a little fucking manners.
What's right is right.

815
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:05,230
- You understand what I'm saying?
- It's all right.

816
00:55:05,313 --> 00:55:09,734
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

817
00:55:11,653 --> 00:55:14,572
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

818
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:17,033
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.

819
00:55:17,116 --> 00:55:20,411
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
- Okay.

820
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:23,122
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

821
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:25,291
No, have the drink with me.

822
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:28,461
The drinks are on the house.

823
00:55:30,213 --> 00:55:33,258
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

824
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:35,593
Fucking break up my party.

825
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:45,687
You've been away for six years.
It's different now.

826
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:48,106
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

827
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:53,194
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

828
00:55:53,278 --> 00:55:55,947
- You're gonna get it.
- You understand?

829
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,451
Get the door!

830
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,760
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

831
00:56:17,844 --> 00:56:19,429
Let's shoot him.

832
00:56:37,322 --> 00:56:39,365
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

833
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:42,160
His whole crew is going to be
looking for him.

834
00:56:44,078 --> 00:56:48,875
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

835
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:52,670
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

836
00:56:52,754 --> 00:56:55,381
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

837
00:56:59,177 --> 00:57:00,929
Go open your trunk.

838
00:57:05,225 --> 00:57:06,976
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

839
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:20,365
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.

840
00:57:22,158 --> 00:57:24,744
Look who's here.

841
00:57:25,995 --> 00:57:27,997
What did you do? What happened?

842
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:30,708
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.

843
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:33,002
What happened to him?

844
00:57:34,045 --> 00:57:37,966
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

845
00:57:38,049 --> 00:57:40,009
You, too. How are you?

846
00:57:40,093 --> 00:57:41,386
Why are you up so late?

847
00:57:41,469 --> 00:57:45,890
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

848
00:57:45,974 --> 00:57:49,894
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

849
00:57:49,978 --> 00:57:52,814
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.

850
00:57:52,897 --> 00:57:55,275
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

851
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:56,693
You go inside.

852
00:57:56,776 --> 00:57:58,153
This stuff is like lead.

853
00:57:58,236 --> 00:58:01,406
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

854
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:04,284
You haven't called. Where have you been?

855
00:58:04,367 --> 00:58:07,370
- I been working nights.
- And?

856
00:58:07,453 --> 00:58:09,330
And tonight we were out late.

857
00:58:09,414 --> 00:58:12,917
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

858
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:16,045
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

859
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:19,924
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?

860
00:58:20,008 --> 00:58:21,926
- Okay.
- Just for a while.

861
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,511
The poor thing.

862
00:58:23,595 --> 00:58:27,432
We hit the deer and his paw...
What do you call it?

863
00:58:27,515 --> 00:58:29,225
The paw.

864
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:31,811
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.

865
00:58:31,895 --> 00:58:33,813
I got to hack it off.

866
00:58:33,897 --> 00:58:36,274
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

867
00:58:36,357 --> 00:58:38,234
I'll bring the knife back.

868
00:58:38,693 --> 00:58:40,570
- Delicious.
- Thank you.

869
00:58:40,778 --> 00:58:43,031
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

870
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:45,033
I do, almost every night.

871
00:58:45,116 --> 00:58:47,744
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

872
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:52,790
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you, I want to be with you.

873
00:58:52,874 --> 00:58:54,292
Settle down.

874
00:58:56,169 --> 00:58:57,879
How's your friend Henry?

875
00:58:57,962 --> 00:59:00,423
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

876
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:02,342
Talk. What are you quiet for?

877
00:59:02,425 --> 00:59:04,969
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

878
00:59:05,053 --> 00:59:07,597
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?

879
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,267
When we were kids,
the <i>compares</i> used to visit each other.

880
00:59:11,476 --> 00:59:16,231
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night, not a word.

881
00:59:16,648 --> 00:59:20,944
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

882
00:59:21,528 --> 00:59:25,240
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

883
00:59:25,782 --> 00:59:29,118
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking."

884
00:59:30,995 --> 00:59:33,581
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

885
00:59:33,665 --> 00:59:35,291
<i>- Cornuto contento.</i>
- That's it.

886
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:39,003
- What does that mean?
- It means he's content to be a jerk.

887
00:59:39,587 --> 00:59:42,131
He doesn't care who knows it.

888
00:59:42,465 --> 00:59:45,093
- Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
- No.

889
00:59:46,094 --> 00:59:47,595
Look at this.

890
00:59:47,887 --> 00:59:49,180
It's beautiful.

891
00:59:49,264 --> 00:59:52,392
I like it. One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

892
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:54,978
One's facing east, the other west.
So what?

893
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:58,565
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got nice white hair.

894
00:59:58,648 --> 01:00:00,900
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

895
01:00:00,984 --> 01:00:02,986
Looks like somebody we know.

896
01:00:04,737 --> 01:00:06,865
Without the beard. It's him.

897
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:10,702
It's him.

898
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:21,629
What the fuck is that?

899
01:00:21,713 --> 01:00:24,382
<i>For most of the guys,</i>
<i>killings were accepted.</i>

900
01:00:24,465 --> 01:00:27,260
<i>Murder was the only way</i>
<i>everybody stayed in line.</i>

901
01:00:27,343 --> 01:00:30,680
<i>You got out of line, you got whacked.</i>
<i>Everybody knew the rules.</i>

902
01:00:30,763 --> 01:00:34,309
<i>Sometimes, even if people didn't</i>
<i>get out of line, they got whacked.</i>

903
01:00:34,392 --> 01:00:38,897
<i>Hits became a habit. Guys would get</i>
<i>into arguments over nothing.</i>

904
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,274
<i>Before you knew it, one was dead.</i>

905
01:00:41,357 --> 01:00:43,651
<i>They were shooting each other</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

906
01:00:43,735 --> 01:00:47,322
<i>Shooting people was a normal thing.</i>
<i>It was no big deal.</i>

907
01:00:48,865 --> 01:00:51,826
<i>We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.</i>

908
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:56,080
<i>This was really a touchy thing.</i>
<i>Tommy killed a made guy.</i>

909
01:00:56,164 --> 01:00:59,918
<i>Batts was part of the Gambino crew</i>
<i>and was considered untouchable.</i>

910
01:01:00,502 --> 01:01:04,047
<i>Before you touched a made guy,</i>
<i>you had to have a good reason.</i>

911
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:06,966
<i>You had to have a sit-down</i>
<i>and you'd better get an okay...</i>

912
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,385
<i>or you'd be the one who got whacked.</i>

913
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:23,525
<i>Saturday night was for wives...</i>

914
01:01:23,608 --> 01:01:26,778
<i>but Friday night at the Copa</i>
<i>was for the girlfriends.</i>

915
01:01:28,571 --> 01:01:30,907
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.

916
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:33,993
You got to see this show.
What a performer.

917
01:01:34,077 --> 01:01:37,664
He does these impersonations.
You'd think it was the real people.

918
01:01:37,747 --> 01:01:41,876
It's unbelievable. You could see
how a white girl could fall for him.

919
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:43,294
What?

920
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,424
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

921
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:50,802
So you condone that stuff.

922
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:52,262
Take it easy.

923
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,891
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

924
01:01:56,975 --> 01:01:58,935
No, I'm not talking about me.

925
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:02,272
But, you know, he's got personality.

926
01:02:02,355 --> 01:02:03,857
Personality?

927
01:02:05,275 --> 01:02:08,361
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

928
01:02:08,444 --> 01:02:11,906
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

929
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:14,450
I just said he was talented,
you're unbelievable.

930
01:02:14,534 --> 01:02:17,120
Just leave it alone now,
I understand what you said.

931
01:02:17,203 --> 01:02:19,289
He's talented. Leave it at that.

932
01:03:57,887 --> 01:04:00,139
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

933
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:19,075
What did you hear about that thing?

934
01:04:19,742 --> 01:04:22,745
- The Brooklyn thing?
- No, the guy from downtown.

935
01:04:23,413 --> 01:04:26,583
- The guy from where Christie lived?
- No.

936
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,962
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

937
01:04:31,713 --> 01:04:33,715
- Know the guy I mean?
- Yeah.

938
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:37,927
His name was Batts. His people
are driving everyone crazy looking for him.

939
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:39,804
Nobody knows what happened to him.

940
01:04:39,888 --> 01:04:43,975
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared. That was it.

941
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:49,939
All right. Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

942
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,442
- All right?
- Yeah.

943
01:04:54,944 --> 01:04:57,071
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

944
01:05:03,286 --> 01:05:04,913
I want my money.

945
01:05:05,997 --> 01:05:07,373
He owes it.

946
01:05:16,257 --> 01:05:19,135
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

947
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:22,680
- Paulie was talking about that.
- Got to get it out of there.

948
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,892
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

949
01:05:25,975 --> 01:05:29,646
- It's been six months.
- We got to get it out of there right away.

950
01:05:42,116 --> 01:05:46,496
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

951
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:52,377
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny, guys.

952
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,962
Here's a leg.

953
01:05:54,045 --> 01:05:55,505
Here's a wing.

954
01:05:56,256 --> 01:06:00,760
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

955
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,680
Oh, that's so bad.

956
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,355
What happened to the car?

957
01:06:12,856 --> 01:06:14,566
I hit a skunk, all right?

958
01:06:14,649 --> 01:06:16,401
Go with your mother.

959
01:06:17,443 --> 01:06:19,279
It's disgusting, Henry.

960
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:26,286
<i>I set up Janice in an apartment</i>
<i>around the corner from The Suite.</i>

961
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:29,205
<i>That way I was able to stay over</i>
<i>a couple of nights a week.</i>

962
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:30,582
This is my new antique lamp.

963
01:06:30,665 --> 01:06:33,835
<i>Karen was home with the kids.</i>
<i>She never asked questions.</i>

964
01:06:33,918 --> 01:06:35,837
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

965
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,589
Looks like Roma.

966
01:06:37,672 --> 01:06:39,966
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

967
01:06:41,968 --> 01:06:43,720
Come see my bedroom.

968
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:48,308
- Tommy, will you take him?
- I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

969
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:54,397
Love that crystal ball or what?

970
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:58,902
This is where we spend most of our time.

971
01:07:00,695 --> 01:07:02,989
I love the floral arrangements.

972
01:07:04,991 --> 01:07:06,075
French.

973
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,163
<i>Janice and I were having so much fun,</i>
<i>she started screwing up at work.</i>

974
01:07:10,246 --> 01:07:12,790
<i>I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.</i>

975
01:07:12,874 --> 01:07:16,544
Janice can do what she wants to do.
Got it?

976
01:07:16,628 --> 01:07:21,007
Just try to run. Hang up once more,
and you'll deal with me.

977
01:07:26,596 --> 01:07:28,806
Come on, get off of her.

978
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,850
You're an animal.

979
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:47,575
Spider, on your way over here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

980
01:07:49,994 --> 01:07:52,330
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm starving.

981
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:56,125
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?

982
01:07:56,209 --> 01:07:58,294
Do I stutter? I play those.

983
01:08:02,131 --> 01:08:04,092
What am I? A mirage?

984
01:08:04,342 --> 01:08:07,053
Where's my fucking drink?
I asked you for a drink.

985
01:08:07,136 --> 01:08:09,889
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.

986
01:08:09,973 --> 01:08:12,892
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

987
01:08:13,685 --> 01:08:15,687
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

988
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:20,066
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

989
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:23,528
- I thought it was Henry.
- You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.

990
01:08:23,611 --> 01:08:25,780
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

991
01:08:25,864 --> 01:08:27,615
You ain't all right.

992
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:29,951
No, I thought you said you were all right.

993
01:08:30,034 --> 01:08:32,954
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

994
01:08:35,081 --> 01:08:38,251
You've been doing this all fucking night
to me, you motherfucker!

995
01:08:38,334 --> 01:08:40,587
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

996
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:43,381
Go get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you little prick.

997
01:08:43,464 --> 01:08:46,050
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.

998
01:08:46,301 --> 01:08:48,136
For everybody else you run.

999
01:08:48,219 --> 01:08:51,890
Run for me, you prick!
Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!

1000
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,975
What's that movie that Bogart made?

1001
01:08:54,058 --> 01:08:56,769
- Where he played a cowboy.
<i>- The Oklahoma Kid.</i>

1002
01:08:56,853 --> 01:09:00,982
<i>- Shane?</i>
- Oklahoma Kid, that's me!

1003
01:09:01,065 --> 01:09:03,735
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1004
01:09:03,818 --> 01:09:05,820
Yahoo, you motherfucker!

1005
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:08,490
Round up those fucking wagons.

1006
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:16,206
Now he's moving.

1007
01:09:17,165 --> 01:09:19,834
- Henry, what happened?
- You shot him in the foot, Tommy.

1008
01:09:19,918 --> 01:09:24,255
He's fucking fine. So he got shot
in the foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?

1009
01:09:24,339 --> 01:09:26,883
- Get a towel.
- Nice fucking game.

1010
01:09:28,384 --> 01:09:33,139
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1011
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:36,351
Take him to the doctor down the street.

1012
01:09:36,768 --> 01:09:38,561
Bones are all shattered.

1013
01:09:38,686 --> 01:09:40,522
Don't get me upset, now.

1014
01:09:40,605 --> 01:09:44,275
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it,
Spider, you little prick.

1015
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:47,111
You trying to make me think
what the fuck I did here.

1016
01:09:47,195 --> 01:09:49,072
It was an accident.

1017
01:09:49,405 --> 01:09:51,699
- Little fucking actor.
- I got a great hand here.

1018
01:09:51,783 --> 01:09:53,243
- You in or out?
- Yeah, I'm in.

1019
01:09:53,326 --> 01:09:55,245
- $800.
- $800?

1020
01:09:55,995 --> 01:09:59,624
You haven't been home in two weeks.
You're not going out tonight!

1021
01:10:00,124 --> 01:10:03,294
Karen, will you grow up! Stop!
I'm still gonna go out!

1022
01:10:03,378 --> 01:10:05,380
Not without your car keys, you're not.

1023
01:10:05,463 --> 01:10:07,549
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1024
01:10:07,632 --> 01:10:09,843
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.

1025
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:12,971
- Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that.
- No!

1026
01:10:13,096 --> 01:10:16,808
I'm telling you, I look in your face
and I know that you're lying!

1027
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,271
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up.

1028
01:10:21,396 --> 01:10:22,605
Get out of my life!

1029
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:25,733
You're fucked in the head, Karen.
This is all in your mind.

1030
01:10:25,817 --> 01:10:28,236
- You're a lousy bastard!
- You got a problem.

1031
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:32,157
Go ahead, go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1032
01:10:32,407 --> 01:10:35,869
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

1033
01:10:46,629 --> 01:10:48,423
Spider, what's your rush?

1034
01:10:51,009 --> 01:10:53,136
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Spider.

1035
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:57,432
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1036
01:10:59,434 --> 01:11:03,271
Next thing you know, he's gonna be
coming in one of these fucking walkers.

1037
01:11:03,354 --> 01:11:05,231
Even though you got that, you can dance?

1038
01:11:05,315 --> 01:11:09,903
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter, you.

1039
01:11:10,153 --> 01:11:12,447
Tell the truth.
You're looking for sympathy?

1040
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:14,908
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?

1041
01:11:19,454 --> 01:11:22,081
I didn't fucking hear right.
Can't believe what I heard.

1042
01:11:22,165 --> 01:11:24,667
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.

1043
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:28,505
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of fucking balls.

1044
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:31,216
Good for you.
Don't take no shit off nobody.

1045
01:11:31,466 --> 01:11:35,094
He shoots him in the foot,
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1046
01:11:36,638 --> 01:11:40,016
Are you gonna let this fucking punk
get away with that?

1047
01:11:40,099 --> 01:11:42,810
What's the matter?
What's the world coming to?

1048
01:11:46,356 --> 01:11:49,484
That's what the fucking world
is coming to. How do you like that?

1049
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:52,904
- How's that, all right?
- What's the fucking matter with you?

1050
01:11:52,987 --> 01:11:54,989
What are you, stupid or what?

1051
01:11:55,073 --> 01:11:58,243
Tommy, I'm kidding with you.
Are you a fucking sick maniac?

1052
01:11:58,326 --> 01:12:01,496
How do I know if you're kidding?
You're breaking my fucking balls?

1053
01:12:01,579 --> 01:12:04,249
I'm fucking kidding with you,
you fucking shoot the guy?

1054
01:12:04,332 --> 01:12:05,542
He's dead.

1055
01:12:07,168 --> 01:12:09,587
Good shot. I'm a lucky man. Good shot.

1056
01:12:09,671 --> 01:12:11,089
You can't miss at this distance.

1057
01:12:11,172 --> 01:12:13,132
You got a problem
with what I did, Anthony?

1058
01:12:13,216 --> 01:12:14,342
No.

1059
01:12:14,425 --> 01:12:18,221
Fucking rat. His whole family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1060
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:20,557
Stupid bastard! I can't fucking believe you.

1061
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,519
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1062
01:12:25,186 --> 01:12:28,982
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1063
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,901
I'll dig the fucking hole.
Where are the shovels?

1064
01:12:32,986 --> 01:12:34,529
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hello?

1065
01:12:34,737 --> 01:12:37,282
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.

1066
01:12:38,366 --> 01:12:41,202
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1067
01:12:41,286 --> 01:12:43,163
<i>I want to talk to you!</i>

1068
01:12:43,413 --> 01:12:46,249
<i>You keep away from my husband,</i>
<i>you hear me?</i>

1069
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,003
<i>Hello? Open the door!</i>

1070
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,298
Answer me!

1071
01:12:53,756 --> 01:12:56,301
I'm gonna tell everyone
who walks in this building...

1072
01:12:56,384 --> 01:12:59,179
that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1073
01:12:59,262 --> 01:13:00,972
Is this the superintendent?

1074
01:13:01,055 --> 01:13:03,600
Yes, I want you to know, sir,
that you have a whore...

1075
01:13:03,683 --> 01:13:05,226
<i>living in 2R!</i>

1076
01:13:05,351 --> 01:13:08,438
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1077
01:13:08,897 --> 01:13:10,482
<i>He's my husband!</i>

1078
01:13:10,565 --> 01:13:13,276
<i>Get your own goddamn man!</i>

1079
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:16,070
Wake up, Henry.

1080
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:31,211
What are you doing?

1081
01:13:33,796 --> 01:13:36,758
- Karen, are you crazy?
- I am crazy.

1082
01:13:38,051 --> 01:13:40,637
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1083
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:45,308
Karen, take it easy.

1084
01:13:48,812 --> 01:13:50,772
- Okay?
- Do you love her?

1085
01:13:52,357 --> 01:13:53,566
Do you?

1086
01:13:54,609 --> 01:13:56,653
- Do you?
- Karen...

1087
01:13:58,947 --> 01:14:01,366
I love you. You know I love you.

1088
01:14:02,534 --> 01:14:04,285
You don't.

1089
01:14:05,787 --> 01:14:07,497
No, you don't.

1090
01:14:08,122 --> 01:14:10,834
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.

1091
01:14:11,626 --> 01:14:15,004
<i>But still I couldn't hurt him.</i>
<i>How could I hurt him?</i>

1092
01:14:15,088 --> 01:14:17,799
<i>I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.</i>

1093
01:14:17,966 --> 01:14:19,467
<i>The truth was...</i>

1094
01:14:19,551 --> 01:14:21,845
<i>that no matter how bad I felt...</i>

1095
01:14:22,595 --> 01:14:25,056
<i>I was still very attracted to him.</i>

1096
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:28,643
<i>Why should I give him to someone else?</i>

1097
01:14:28,726 --> 01:14:30,603
<i>Why should she win?</i>

1098
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:36,151
Just put it down.

1099
01:14:37,318 --> 01:14:39,779
You know I love you, don't you?

1100
01:14:39,988 --> 01:14:42,073
You're all I want, Karen.

1101
01:14:43,491 --> 01:14:45,702
Please put the gun down, Karen.

1102
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:49,247
Baby, come on.

1103
01:15:03,178 --> 01:15:05,555
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?

1104
01:15:06,931 --> 01:15:09,809
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1105
01:15:09,893 --> 01:15:13,563
I got to fucking come home for this?

1106
01:15:14,105 --> 01:15:16,149
I should fucking kill you!

1107
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,235
How does it feel?

1108
01:15:20,278 --> 01:15:22,238
How does it feel, Karen?

1109
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,798
I'm sorry!

1110
01:15:47,764 --> 01:15:49,766
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1111
01:15:50,642 --> 01:15:53,728
- Looking good.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

1112
01:15:53,812 --> 01:15:56,356
- Hi, Paulie!
- Hi, honey. How are you?

1113
01:15:56,439 --> 01:15:57,524
Good.

1114
01:15:57,607 --> 01:16:00,318
- Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?
- Sure.

1115
01:16:01,152 --> 01:16:03,696
- Any of you need anything?
- I'm all right.

1116
01:16:03,988 --> 01:16:06,908
- Want anything to drink? A beer?
- No.

1117
01:16:06,991 --> 01:16:09,577
- Chinese food?
- No, come on, sit down.

1118
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:18,336
Karen came to the house.

1119
01:16:19,045 --> 01:16:19,712
She's very upset.

1120
01:16:20,213 --> 01:16:22,632
This is no good.
You gotta straighten this thing out.

1121
01:16:22,715 --> 01:16:26,010
We got to have calm now. We don't know
what the hell she's gonna do.

1122
01:16:26,094 --> 01:16:28,513
She's getting all hysterical.
She gets very excited.

1123
01:16:28,596 --> 01:16:32,517
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1124
01:16:33,268 --> 01:16:36,813
I'm not saying you gotta go back to her
this minute, but you gotta go back.

1125
01:16:36,896 --> 01:16:39,440
It's the only way.
You gotta keep up appearances.

1126
01:16:39,524 --> 01:16:42,068
The two of them come over every day,
commiserating.

1127
01:16:42,152 --> 01:16:44,112
I can't have it.

1128
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,699
I can't do it, Henry.

1129
01:16:47,782 --> 01:16:50,910
Nobody says that you can't do
what you wanna do.

1130
01:16:50,994 --> 01:16:53,746
We all know that. I mean, this is what it is.

1131
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:56,666
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.

1132
01:16:56,749 --> 01:16:59,169
You have to go home to the family,
you understand?

1133
01:16:59,252 --> 01:17:01,880
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1134
01:17:02,172 --> 01:17:04,424
You gotta go home. Smarten up.

1135
01:17:05,091 --> 01:17:06,676
- All right?
- All right.

1136
01:17:06,801 --> 01:17:08,428
I'm gonna talk to Karen.

1137
01:17:08,511 --> 01:17:12,056
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1138
01:17:12,557 --> 01:17:14,601
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her...

1139
01:17:14,684 --> 01:17:17,729
and it'll be just the way
it was when you were first married...

1140
01:17:17,812 --> 01:17:19,689
your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.

1141
01:17:19,772 --> 01:17:21,816
I know how to talk to her,
especially to her.

1142
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,527
Jimmy and Tommy are going down
to Tampa this weekend...

1143
01:17:24,611 --> 01:17:25,904
to pick up something for me.

1144
01:17:25,987 --> 01:17:27,572
Instead, you go with Jimmy.

1145
01:17:27,655 --> 01:17:29,157
You come with me, we'll go down.

1146
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,826
Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.

1147
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,786
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1148
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:35,830
- We'll have a good time.
- Enjoy yourselves.

1149
01:17:35,914 --> 01:17:38,583
And when you come back,
you go back to Karen.

1150
01:17:39,209 --> 01:17:40,960
Please, there's no other way.

1151
01:17:41,044 --> 01:17:43,755
You're not gonna get a divorce.
We're not <i>animali.</i>

1152
01:17:43,838 --> 01:17:46,424
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1153
01:17:48,218 --> 01:17:51,137
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.

1154
01:17:55,433 --> 01:17:57,101
You gonna pay us?

1155
01:18:03,483 --> 01:18:06,486
- You gonna pay?
- Give us the fucking money!

1156
01:18:07,028 --> 01:18:09,072
I can't, I swear.

1157
01:18:10,657 --> 01:18:11,908
Let's go.

1158
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,211
- We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
- No!

1159
01:18:23,294 --> 01:18:26,089
What fucking lions?
I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!

1160
01:18:26,172 --> 01:18:28,591
- Let's throw him over the moat.
- All right.

1161
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:30,051
I'll get the money!

1162
01:18:30,134 --> 01:18:32,929
<i>They must really feed each other</i>
<i>to the lions down there...</i>

1163
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:34,848
<i>because the guy gave the money right up.</i>

1164
01:18:34,931 --> 01:18:36,641
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.

1165
01:18:36,724 --> 01:18:38,810
<i>We got to spend the rest of the weekend</i>
<i>at the track.</i>

1166
01:18:39,269 --> 01:18:40,687
Yeah. They mean business.

1167
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:43,398
<i>Then, I couldn't believe what happened.</i>

1168
01:18:43,815 --> 01:18:46,401
<i>When we got home,</i>
<i>we were all over the newspaper.</i>

1169
01:18:46,484 --> 01:18:49,779
<i>At first, I didn't even know</i>
<i>why we got picked up.</i>

1170
01:18:49,863 --> 01:18:52,073
<i>Then I found out</i>
<i>that the guy we roughed up...</i>

1171
01:18:52,157 --> 01:18:55,618
<i>turned out to have a sister</i>
<i>working as a typist for the FBI.</i>

1172
01:18:55,702 --> 01:18:58,538
<i>Who could believe it?</i>
<i>Of all the fucking people.</i>

1173
01:18:58,621 --> 01:19:01,958
<i>She gave up everybody:</i>
<i>Jimmy, me, even her brother.</i>

1174
01:19:03,376 --> 01:19:06,254
<i>It took the jury six hours</i>
<i>to bring us in guilty.</i>

1175
01:19:06,379 --> 01:19:09,716
<i>The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years</i>
<i>like he was giving away candy.</i>

1176
01:19:09,799 --> 01:19:12,468
...ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1177
01:19:12,677 --> 01:19:16,764
You will now be turned over
to the U.S. Attorney General's office.

1178
01:19:21,019 --> 01:19:22,729
Toast, guys.

1179
01:19:22,812 --> 01:19:25,231
Good trip, good life, get out soon.

1180
01:19:25,315 --> 01:19:27,192
Good trip, sweetheart.

1181
01:19:30,111 --> 01:19:32,238
We'll watch the home front.

1182
01:19:33,698 --> 01:19:36,159
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1183
01:19:37,202 --> 01:19:40,413
Yeah, motherfuck them
every chance you get.

1184
01:19:46,252 --> 01:19:48,755
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1185
01:20:01,142 --> 01:20:02,393
Now take me to jail.

1186
01:20:07,106 --> 01:20:09,943
<i>In prison, dinner was always a big thing.</i>

1187
01:20:10,276 --> 01:20:13,780
<i>We had a pasta course,</i>
<i>and then we had a meat or a fish.</i>

1188
01:20:14,405 --> 01:20:17,367
<i>Paulie did the prep work.</i>
<i>He was doing a year for contempt...</i>

1189
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:19,869
<i>and had this wonderful system</i>
<i>for doing the garlic.</i>

1190
01:20:19,953 --> 01:20:23,081
<i>He used a razor,</i>
<i>and he used to slice it so thin...</i>

1191
01:20:23,164 --> 01:20:26,000
<i>that it used to liquefy in the pan</i>
<i>with just a little oil.</i>

1192
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:28,127
<i>It was a very good system.</i>

1193
01:20:28,336 --> 01:20:30,922
<i>Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.</i>

1194
01:20:31,005 --> 01:20:32,465
Get the smell?

1195
01:20:32,549 --> 01:20:35,385
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

1196
01:20:35,468 --> 01:20:37,512
Veal, beef, and pork.

1197
01:20:37,887 --> 01:20:40,056
Good, but you gotta have the pork.

1198
01:20:40,139 --> 01:20:41,766
That's the flavor.

1199
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:45,395
<i>I felt he used too many onions,</i>
<i>but it was still a very good sauce.</i>

1200
01:20:45,478 --> 01:20:48,314
Vinnie, don't put too many onions
in the sauce.

1201
01:20:48,398 --> 01:20:51,025
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1202
01:20:51,317 --> 01:20:53,194
Put three small onions, that's all I did.

1203
01:20:53,278 --> 01:20:56,030
Three onions? How many cans
of tomatoes you put in there?

1204
01:20:56,114 --> 01:20:58,825
- I put two big cans.
- You don't need three onions.

1205
01:20:58,908 --> 01:21:00,994
<i>Johnny Dio did the meat.</i>

1206
01:21:01,077 --> 01:21:03,746
<i>We had no broiler,</i>
<i>so Johnny did everything in pans.</i>

1207
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:06,040
<i>It used to smell up the joint</i>
<i>something awful...</i>

1208
01:21:06,124 --> 01:21:09,169
<i>and the hacks used to die,</i>
<i>but he still cooked a great steak.</i>

1209
01:21:09,252 --> 01:21:11,796
- How do you like yours?
- Medium rare.

1210
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:14,507
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1211
01:21:14,924 --> 01:21:18,761
<i>You know, when you think of prison</i>
<i>you get pictures in your mind...</i>

1212
01:21:18,845 --> 01:21:22,557
<i>of all those old movies</i>
<i>with rows of guys behind bars.</i>

1213
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,559
<i>It wasn't like that for wiseguys.</i>

1214
01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:27,479
<i>It really wasn't that bad,</i>
<i>excepting that I missed Jimmy...</i>

1215
01:21:27,562 --> 01:21:29,063
<i>who was doing his time in Atlanta.</i>

1216
01:21:29,147 --> 01:21:32,192
Give me two steaks
while you're in there, all right?

1217
01:21:33,026 --> 01:21:37,489
<i>Everyone else in the joint was doing</i>
<i>real time, mixed together, living like pigs.</i>

1218
01:21:37,614 --> 01:21:40,700
<i>But we lived alone. We owned the joint.</i>

1219
01:21:40,783 --> 01:21:44,245
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1220
01:21:44,329 --> 01:21:45,747
Good, they deserved it.

1221
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:49,250
<i>Even the hacks we couldn't bribe</i>
<i>would never rat on the guys we did.</i>

1222
01:21:49,334 --> 01:21:51,252
...had respect. People loved one another.

1223
01:21:51,336 --> 01:21:52,504
They left their doors open.

1224
01:21:52,587 --> 01:21:53,713
Sorry it took so long.

1225
01:21:53,796 --> 01:21:56,466
The skinny guard's getting to be
a real pain in the ass.

1226
01:21:56,549 --> 01:21:59,761
- We're gonna have to do something.
- I took care of him.

1227
01:21:59,844 --> 01:22:01,638
What'd you bring?

1228
01:22:01,721 --> 01:22:03,223
- Bread.
- Good.

1229
01:22:03,556 --> 01:22:05,892
- Fresh.
- Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

1230
01:22:05,975 --> 01:22:08,353
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1231
01:22:08,436 --> 01:22:10,021
Come on, what else?

1232
01:22:10,104 --> 01:22:11,606
- Scotch.
- Nice.

1233
01:22:12,607 --> 01:22:14,442
- Some red wine.
- Okay.

1234
01:22:14,776 --> 01:22:16,736
- Now we can eat.
- I got some white, too.

1235
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,655
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.

1236
01:22:18,738 --> 01:22:21,741
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.

1237
01:22:22,325 --> 01:22:23,493
Some more bread.

1238
01:22:23,576 --> 01:22:26,454
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1239
01:22:26,538 --> 01:22:28,706
- You must be kidding.
- Believe me.

1240
01:22:37,757 --> 01:22:39,425
What are you doing?

1241
01:22:44,514 --> 01:22:46,391
I'll take that.

1242
01:22:48,768 --> 01:22:51,312
- All right, I'll catch you guys later.
- Yeah.

1243
01:22:51,396 --> 01:22:53,731
You going for a walk in the park?

1244
01:22:55,275 --> 01:22:58,403
- Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
- Okay.

1245
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:03,950
- Is there any more?
- No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1246
01:23:04,033 --> 01:23:04,909
- Thanks.
- You too, Henry.

1247
01:23:13,668 --> 01:23:14,878
Mrs. Hill, come here.

1248
01:23:14,961 --> 01:23:16,129
Come on.

1249
01:23:19,507 --> 01:23:21,593
You girls stay right here.

1250
01:23:21,968 --> 01:23:25,346
- I want you to hold hands.
- Okay, go right up to the front.

1251
01:23:25,555 --> 01:23:27,557
- Let's go.
- How you doing?

1252
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:30,185
- Good, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

1253
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:44,782
- What you talking about?
- I saw her name in the register.

1254
01:23:44,866 --> 01:23:46,993
- Jesus Christ.
- You want her to visit you?

1255
01:23:47,076 --> 01:23:50,997
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing letters to the parole board.

1256
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,042
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1257
01:23:54,292 --> 01:23:56,544
I can't stop people from coming to see me.

1258
01:23:56,628 --> 01:24:00,006
Good, let her sneak this stuff in
for you every week.

1259
01:24:00,089 --> 01:24:04,719
- Let her fight these bastards every week!
- Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1260
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:07,430
I'm sorry.

1261
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:10,391
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1262
01:24:11,434 --> 01:24:13,311
Will you stop it, Karen?

1263
01:24:13,728 --> 01:24:16,314
- Let her do it!
- Stop it!

1264
01:24:24,489 --> 01:24:27,867
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

1265
01:24:28,785 --> 01:24:30,829
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1266
01:24:31,204 --> 01:24:34,499
I asked your friend Remo
for the money that he owes you.

1267
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:36,042
You know what he told me?

1268
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:39,796
He told me to take my kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1269
01:24:39,879 --> 01:24:41,881
It's gonna be okay.

1270
01:24:42,048 --> 01:24:46,219
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never
seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

1271
01:24:46,302 --> 01:24:49,180
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.

1272
01:24:49,264 --> 01:24:53,268
I told you that we're on our own.
Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

1273
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:58,273
As long as he's on parole,
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1274
01:25:00,733 --> 01:25:03,069
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. Listen to me.

1275
01:25:03,153 --> 01:25:05,822
All I need for you
is to keep bringing me the stuff.

1276
01:25:05,905 --> 01:25:08,700
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh
who'll help me move it.

1277
01:25:08,783 --> 01:25:10,368
In a month we're gonna be fine.

1278
01:25:10,451 --> 01:25:12,954
- We won't need anybody.
- I'm afraid.

1279
01:25:13,037 --> 01:25:15,081
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1280
01:25:15,165 --> 01:25:16,541
Don't worry about him.

1281
01:25:16,624 --> 01:25:20,211
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?

1282
01:25:21,337 --> 01:25:22,881
We've gotta help each other.

1283
01:25:22,964 --> 01:25:26,634
We've just gotta be really careful
while we do it.

1284
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:33,558
I don't want to hear a word
about her anymore.

1285
01:25:33,641 --> 01:25:34,726
Never.

1286
01:26:00,084 --> 01:26:01,753
Daddy!

1287
01:26:03,379 --> 01:26:05,715
- We missed you.
- Are you here to stay?

1288
01:26:05,798 --> 01:26:09,427
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1289
01:26:09,511 --> 01:26:11,012
I did the sun.

1290
01:26:11,137 --> 01:26:15,058
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1291
01:26:15,892 --> 01:26:17,769
Do you like the house?

1292
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,105
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

1293
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:22,273
With what?

1294
01:26:22,482 --> 01:26:25,485
Don't worry with what.
Just start looking for a new house.

1295
01:26:25,568 --> 01:26:29,239
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
Those guys there owe me $15,000.

1296
01:26:29,322 --> 01:26:31,324
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.

1297
01:26:31,407 --> 01:26:34,285
Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

1298
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:37,288
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1299
01:26:37,872 --> 01:26:40,250
- Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
- Me!

1300
01:26:50,552 --> 01:26:52,136
What do you want?

1301
01:26:52,387 --> 01:26:54,430
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1302
01:26:57,892 --> 01:27:00,770
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1303
01:27:02,897 --> 01:27:04,774
I don't want any more of that shit.

1304
01:27:04,858 --> 01:27:05,984
What shit?

1305
01:27:06,067 --> 01:27:08,778
- Just stay away from the garbage.
- Look, Paulie...

1306
01:27:08,862 --> 01:27:12,282
I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.

1307
01:27:12,365 --> 01:27:15,076
I'm talking about now. From now.
Here and now.

1308
01:27:15,827 --> 01:27:18,663
- Why would I get into that?
- Don't make a jerk out of me.

1309
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:20,331
Just don't do it.

1310
01:27:24,043 --> 01:27:27,088
I want to talk to you about Jimmy.
You gotta watch out for him.

1311
01:27:27,172 --> 01:27:30,008
He's a good earner, but he's wild,
takes too many chances.

1312
01:27:30,091 --> 01:27:32,635
I know Jimmy. You think
I would take chances like him?

1313
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:34,470
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.

1314
01:27:34,554 --> 01:27:36,389
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

1315
01:27:36,473 --> 01:27:38,224
You gotta watch out for kids like this.

1316
01:27:38,308 --> 01:27:41,019
I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.

1317
01:27:41,102 --> 01:27:43,730
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs,
you understand?

1318
01:27:43,813 --> 01:27:48,318
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's
gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

1319
01:27:48,526 --> 01:27:52,530
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1320
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:55,533
Gribbs got 20 years just
for saying hello to some fuck...

1321
01:27:55,617 --> 01:27:57,702
who was sneaking behind his back,
selling junk.

1322
01:27:57,785 --> 01:28:00,371
I don't need that.
That won't happen to me, understand?

1323
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:02,749
You know you're out early
because I got you a job.

1324
01:28:02,832 --> 01:28:04,876
I don't need this heat,
you understand that?

1325
01:28:04,959 --> 01:28:08,922
You see anybody fucking around
with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?

1326
01:28:09,005 --> 01:28:10,215
That means anybody.

1327
01:28:10,298 --> 01:28:11,382
- All right.
- Yeah?

1328
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:13,051
Yeah. Of course.

1329
01:28:20,391 --> 01:28:24,562
<i>Took me about a week of sneaking around</i>
<i>before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.</i>

1330
01:28:24,646 --> 01:28:27,232
<i>But when I did, it was a real score.</i>

1331
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:29,901
<i>I started using Sandy's place</i>
<i>to mix the stuff.</i>

1332
01:28:29,984 --> 01:28:32,529
<i>And even with Sandy snorting</i>
<i>more than she mixed...</i>

1333
01:28:32,612 --> 01:28:35,323
<i>I could see that</i>
<i>this was a really good business.</i>

1334
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:37,826
<i>I made $12,000 in my second week.</i>

1335
01:28:38,409 --> 01:28:41,579
<i>I had a down payment on my house</i>
<i>and things were really rolling.</i>

1336
01:28:41,663 --> 01:28:45,917
<i>All I had to do was every once in a while</i>
<i>tell Sandy that I loved her.</i>

1337
01:28:49,504 --> 01:28:51,548
<i>But it was perfect, I'm telling you.</i>

1338
01:28:51,631 --> 01:28:54,217
<i>As long as I kept getting</i>
<i>the stuff from Pittsburgh...</i>

1339
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,052
<i>I knew Paulie would never find out.</i>

1340
01:28:56,135 --> 01:29:00,056
<i>Within a couple of weeks,</i>
<i>it got so big I needed some help.</i>

1341
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:03,184
<i>So I got Jimmy and Tommy</i>
<i>to come in with me.</i>

1342
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,186
It's fucking great.

1343
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,521
Mr. Conway.

1344
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,279
- Bring your pay slips?
- Yeah.

1345
01:29:17,323 --> 01:29:19,659
Four and a half months of dirt.

1346
01:29:20,827 --> 01:29:22,787
- It's so good.
- I did it.

1347
01:29:23,955 --> 01:29:26,583
- Do you love it?
- It's wonderful.

1348
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,879
And this we just had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

1349
01:29:30,962 --> 01:29:33,464
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1350
01:29:33,673 --> 01:29:35,258
Okay, you ready?

1351
01:29:35,341 --> 01:29:37,510
Watch the wall with the rock.

1352
01:29:45,143 --> 01:29:47,979
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1353
01:29:49,147 --> 01:29:50,982
Come on. All right.

1354
01:29:51,065 --> 01:29:54,736
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1355
01:29:54,819 --> 01:29:56,237
It's nice, huh?

1356
01:29:56,321 --> 01:29:58,448
Henry, come over here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?

1357
01:29:58,531 --> 01:30:01,075
I talked to him,
and he's looking into everything.

1358
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:04,454
This'll make the Air France haul
look like goddamn peanuts.

1359
01:30:04,537 --> 01:30:06,873
- Come on.
- He's gonna do it, right?

1360
01:30:06,956 --> 01:30:08,833
I told you. He'll check everything out.

1361
01:30:08,917 --> 01:30:11,669
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1362
01:30:11,753 --> 01:30:15,965
I know. Do you understand?
There's millions in there. And I've been...

1363
01:30:16,049 --> 01:30:19,802
bleeding for this caper, been cultivating
this son of a bitch for two years.

1364
01:30:19,886 --> 01:30:23,014
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.

1365
01:30:23,097 --> 01:30:27,060
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1366
01:30:27,143 --> 01:30:29,145
Morrie, let's get a drink.

1367
01:30:29,646 --> 01:30:32,732
<i>These are the guys that Jimmy</i>
<i>put together for what turned out to be...</i>

1368
01:30:32,816 --> 01:30:36,694
<i>the biggest heist in American history:</i>
<i>The Lufthansa heist.</i>

1369
01:30:37,987 --> 01:30:40,740
<i>Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab</i>
<i>the outside guard...</i>

1370
01:30:40,824 --> 01:30:43,368
<i>and make him get us in the front door.</i>

1371
01:30:44,619 --> 01:30:47,872
<i>Frenchy and Joe Buddha</i>
<i>had to round up the workers.</i>

1372
01:30:48,456 --> 01:30:52,585
<i>Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them</i>
<i>all tied up and away from the alarms.</i>

1373
01:30:53,211 --> 01:30:55,505
<i>Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.</i>

1374
01:30:55,588 --> 01:30:59,217
<i>He used to hang around the lounge</i>
<i>and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.</i>

1375
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,886
<i>What he was supposed to do</i>
<i>was steal the panel truck...</i>

1376
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:05,098
<i>and afterwards compact it</i>
<i>by a friend of ours out in Jersey.</i>

1377
01:31:05,181 --> 01:31:07,642
<i>Only Morrie was driving us nuts.</i>

1378
01:31:07,725 --> 01:31:09,727
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

1379
01:31:09,811 --> 01:31:13,064
<i>Just because he set this up,</i>
<i>he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...</i>

1380
01:31:13,148 --> 01:31:15,733
<i>for an advance on the money</i>
<i>we were going to steal.</i>

1381
01:31:15,817 --> 01:31:19,445
<i>He didn't mean anything by it.</i>
<i>That's just the way he was.</i>

1382
01:31:26,286 --> 01:31:30,415
<i>I had everybody working for me.</i>
<i>Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.</i>

1383
01:31:33,418 --> 01:31:34,878
Did you have a good flight?

1384
01:31:34,961 --> 01:31:37,630
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where did you find such creeps?

1385
01:31:37,714 --> 01:31:39,716
Come on, they're not that bad.

1386
01:31:40,842 --> 01:31:42,719
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1387
01:31:43,011 --> 01:31:45,513
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1388
01:31:45,597 --> 01:31:48,725
No, that one was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1389
01:31:49,684 --> 01:31:50,935
Big yawn.

1390
01:31:51,019 --> 01:31:52,770
She looks just like you.

1391
01:31:53,438 --> 01:31:55,773
That's what the stewardess said.

1392
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:10,413
Take it easy, Sandy.

1393
01:32:10,497 --> 01:32:13,291
Come on, give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.

1394
01:32:13,374 --> 01:32:16,836
You got all day. Just make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1395
01:32:17,212 --> 01:32:19,088
- I got to go.
- Where are you going?

1396
01:32:19,172 --> 01:32:23,301
Don't start. You know I gotta go
do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?

1397
01:32:24,594 --> 01:32:26,012
Over there.

1398
01:32:26,095 --> 01:32:27,764
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.

1399
01:32:27,847 --> 01:32:29,974
What do you think
I got you the dishwasher for?

1400
01:32:30,058 --> 01:32:32,018
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

1401
01:32:32,101 --> 01:32:33,978
How could you hate it?
You got to be smart.

1402
01:32:34,062 --> 01:32:37,357
Look at all this powder around here.
That could put us away forever.

1403
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,692
- Loosen up.
- What are you doing?

1404
01:32:40,693 --> 01:32:44,072
- You know, I gotta...
- You don't have to go anywhere.

1405
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:46,741
Make them wait.

1406
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:59,838
<i>Nobody knows for sure just how much</i>
<i>was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid...</i>

1407
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:02,632
<i>at the Lufthansa cargo terminal</i>
<i>at Kennedy Airport.</i>

1408
01:33:02,715 --> 01:33:06,469
<i>The FBI says $2 million,</i>
<i>Port Authority Police say $4 million...</i>

1409
01:33:09,806 --> 01:33:11,933
Jimmy!

1410
01:33:12,016 --> 01:33:13,935
Those sons of bitches!

1411
01:33:14,018 --> 01:33:16,437
<i>... from the scene of the heist at JFK.</i>

1412
01:33:16,521 --> 01:33:20,191
<i>It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest</i>
<i>this town has ever seen.</i>

1413
01:33:22,068 --> 01:33:24,237
Come here, you! Come here!

1414
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:28,032
Look at this genius. This genius!

1415
01:33:32,453 --> 01:33:34,372
Merry Christmas.

1416
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:41,588
- Hello, who's this?
- That's my wife.

1417
01:33:42,213 --> 01:33:45,550
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.

1418
01:33:48,219 --> 01:33:49,679
Isn't she gorgeous?

1419
01:33:49,762 --> 01:33:52,974
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe. I love that car.

1420
01:33:55,768 --> 01:33:58,688
What did I tell you?
I talked to you before, didn't I?

1421
01:33:58,771 --> 01:34:00,190
Didn't I say what was going on?

1422
01:34:00,273 --> 01:34:02,484
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while?

1423
01:34:02,567 --> 01:34:05,612
- The fucking car?
- It's a wedding gift from my mother.

1424
01:34:05,695 --> 01:34:07,906
It's under her name. I just got married.

1425
01:34:07,989 --> 01:34:10,867
- I love that car.
- Excuse me, darling, for just a second.

1426
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:13,328
- I just got married.
- Are you nuts?

1427
01:34:13,411 --> 01:34:15,914
- What are you getting excited for?
- Are you stupid?

1428
01:34:15,997 --> 01:34:18,791
We got a million bulls out there.
Everybody's watching us.

1429
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:20,752
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?

1430
01:34:20,835 --> 01:34:23,129
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1431
01:34:23,213 --> 01:34:25,131
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?

1432
01:34:25,215 --> 01:34:27,467
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.

1433
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:31,304
Don't get anything. Nothing big.
What's the matter with you?

1434
01:34:31,471 --> 01:34:33,014
What are you getting excited for?

1435
01:34:33,097 --> 01:34:36,643
Because you're going to get us all
fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?

1436
01:34:36,726 --> 01:34:39,479
- What's the matter with you?
- I apologize.

1437
01:34:40,855 --> 01:34:44,067
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

1438
01:34:46,361 --> 01:34:47,695
I'm sorry.

1439
01:34:50,323 --> 01:34:53,827
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.

1440
01:34:54,494 --> 01:34:57,247
What'd you say? You being
a fucking wise guy with me?

1441
01:34:57,330 --> 01:35:00,250
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- What did I tell you?

1442
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:03,753
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1443
01:35:03,837 --> 01:35:05,547
Don't buy anything!

1444
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:07,257
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1445
01:35:10,468 --> 01:35:12,929
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.

1446
01:35:20,353 --> 01:35:22,772
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid or what?

1447
01:35:22,856 --> 01:35:24,190
Excuse me.

1448
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,192
- What's the matter?
- Take it off.

1449
01:35:26,276 --> 01:35:29,279
- Why? What's the matter?
- Take it off!

1450
01:35:31,447 --> 01:35:35,034
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
and not to attract attention?

1451
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:38,288
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1452
01:35:38,371 --> 01:35:40,331
- Bring it fucking back.
- I'll bring it back.

1453
01:35:40,415 --> 01:35:44,002
I don't care what you do.
Bring it where you got it before.

1454
01:35:44,085 --> 01:35:46,963
- Get it out of here!
- All right. Let's go, honey.

1455
01:35:51,092 --> 01:35:53,219
Shut the fuck up and let's go.

1456
01:35:56,264 --> 01:35:58,808
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1457
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:04,981
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look
at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.

1458
01:36:05,064 --> 01:36:09,319
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1459
01:36:09,527 --> 01:36:11,029
That's great.

1460
01:36:11,154 --> 01:36:14,240
Tell them all to relax.
Don't attract attention.

1461
01:36:17,327 --> 01:36:19,245
I've been looking all over for you.

1462
01:36:19,329 --> 01:36:20,997
How are you? Merry Christmas.

1463
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,124
Listen, I need the money.

1464
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:27,045
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
- Jimmy, I need the money.

1465
01:36:27,128 --> 01:36:29,380
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1466
01:36:29,464 --> 01:36:32,550
- I did what I had to do. I need the money.
- Not tonight, Morrie.

1467
01:36:32,634 --> 01:36:36,638
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.
Everybody's flashing their stuff.

1468
01:36:36,721 --> 01:36:39,557
Evidently, they got their money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1469
01:36:39,641 --> 01:36:43,102
- Just not tonight.
- They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.

1470
01:36:45,438 --> 01:36:48,066
I got $500,000 coming to me.

1471
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:50,693
The biggest fucking bundle
he ever made in his life.

1472
01:36:50,777 --> 01:36:53,488
Morrie, I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink, all right?

1473
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:55,740
- I'll talk to him.
- It's poison in my eyes.

1474
01:36:55,824 --> 01:36:58,743
- Morris, baby, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

1475
01:37:04,499 --> 01:37:07,877
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1476
01:37:11,047 --> 01:37:12,382
We did it!

1477
01:37:15,385 --> 01:37:17,095
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

1478
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,722
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's me.

1479
01:37:19,806 --> 01:37:21,432
Pete? One second.

1480
01:37:22,016 --> 01:37:25,395
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1481
01:37:25,478 --> 01:37:27,313
- Do what's right, you understand?
- Yeah.

1482
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,650
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1483
01:37:31,192 --> 01:37:33,903
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1484
01:37:35,363 --> 01:37:38,992
- What do you think, Mommy?
- I love them all.

1485
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,827
I love the gold outfit.

1486
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:42,745
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

1487
01:37:42,829 --> 01:37:44,289
- What?
- Merry Christmas.

1488
01:37:44,372 --> 01:37:45,707
And?

1489
01:37:46,082 --> 01:37:47,625
Happy Hanukkah.

1490
01:37:48,501 --> 01:37:51,754
- Very funny.
- Go get yourself something nice, okay?

1491
01:38:00,096 --> 01:38:04,434
<i>Lufthansa should have been</i>
<i>our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.</i>

1492
01:38:05,018 --> 01:38:08,271
<i>$6 million in cash.</i>
<i>More than enough to go around.</i>

1493
01:38:18,281 --> 01:38:19,741
Yo, Stacks!

1494
01:38:20,116 --> 01:38:22,744
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?

1495
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,837
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1496
01:38:32,921 --> 01:38:36,382
- You didn't bring any coffee?
- What do I look like, a fucking caterer?

1497
01:38:36,466 --> 01:38:39,761
Frankie will make coffee.
Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.

1498
01:38:42,472 --> 01:38:44,641
Thought you had
one of your bitches in here.

1499
01:38:44,724 --> 01:38:47,143
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?

1500
01:38:48,144 --> 01:38:51,189
Always got these hot books around,
or a bitch, or something.

1501
01:38:51,272 --> 01:38:52,565
What time is it?

1502
01:38:52,649 --> 01:38:56,694
- It's 11:30. We had to be there by 9:00.
- I'll be ready in a minute.

1503
01:38:56,778 --> 01:39:00,782
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

1504
01:39:05,662 --> 01:39:09,582
What the fuck you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1505
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:14,671
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

1506
01:39:14,754 --> 01:39:17,799
Put the fucking pot down.
You gonna take the coffee?

1507
01:39:37,443 --> 01:39:39,404
<i>Stacks was always crazy.</i>

1508
01:39:39,737 --> 01:39:43,491
<i>Instead of getting rid of the truck</i>
<i>as he was supposed to, he got stoned...</i>

1509
01:39:43,575 --> 01:39:48,204
<i>went to his girlfriend's, and by the time</i>
<i>he woke up, the cops had found the truck.</i>

1510
01:39:48,288 --> 01:39:50,456
<i>It was all over the television.</i>

1511
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:53,668
<i>They even said they came up</i>
<i>with prints off the wheel.</i>

1512
01:39:54,252 --> 01:39:57,714
<i>It was just a matter of time</i>
<i>before they got to Stacks.</i>

1513
01:40:09,476 --> 01:40:11,269
I gotta talk to you.

1514
01:40:11,519 --> 01:40:14,105
- Have a drink.
- Have a drink. Come on.

1515
01:40:14,606 --> 01:40:18,401
Have a drink. What you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1516
01:40:19,736 --> 01:40:21,779
I still gotta talk to you.

1517
01:40:22,113 --> 01:40:23,198
What?

1518
01:40:23,281 --> 01:40:25,867
- What happened with Stacks?
- Don't worry about that.

1519
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:29,746
- There's feds all over the place.
- So what? Where are they gonna go?

1520
01:40:30,246 --> 01:40:32,790
- It's in the papers.
- He's worried.

1521
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:35,126
What are you worried about?

1522
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:38,713
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1523
01:40:38,796 --> 01:40:42,050
- What are you worried about?
- You worry too much.

1524
01:40:42,342 --> 01:40:45,053
Everything is beautiful.
There's nothing to worry about.

1525
01:40:45,136 --> 01:40:47,597
- Didn't you tell him?
- I didn't tell him yet.

1526
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,140
- What?
- Guess what?

1527
01:40:50,725 --> 01:40:52,435
They're gonna make him.

1528
01:40:54,062 --> 01:40:55,980
Paulie's going to make you?

1529
01:40:56,773 --> 01:40:57,982
Tommy.

1530
01:40:58,066 --> 01:41:00,693
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1531
01:41:00,777 --> 01:41:03,530
You believe that?
This little guinea bastard.

1532
01:41:04,447 --> 01:41:08,952
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work
for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

1533
01:41:09,953 --> 01:41:11,621
I can't believe it.

1534
01:41:11,704 --> 01:41:13,957
I'm really happy for you.
Great. Congratulations.

1535
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,042
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1536
01:41:16,835 --> 01:41:21,130
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?

1537
01:41:21,881 --> 01:41:24,300
I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with dick.

1538
01:41:24,384 --> 01:41:27,929
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.

1539
01:41:28,138 --> 01:41:30,306
I want my money! I've had it up to here!

1540
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:32,767
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1541
01:41:32,892 --> 01:41:35,687
- Fuck him! I want my money!
- Good. Go tell him.

1542
01:41:38,439 --> 01:41:41,234
You're gonna keep your mouth shut,
or what?

1543
01:41:42,861 --> 01:41:44,821
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

1544
01:41:44,904 --> 01:41:47,365
You just got to stop busting balls.

1545
01:41:47,782 --> 01:41:50,743
All right? Look at me. You hear me?
Look at me, okay?

1546
01:41:50,827 --> 01:41:52,996
Everything's going to be fine.

1547
01:41:59,127 --> 01:42:00,211
Henry.

1548
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:09,721
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1549
01:42:51,596 --> 01:42:54,974
<i>I could see for the first time</i>
<i>that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.</i>

1550
01:42:55,058 --> 01:42:58,353
<i>His mind was going in</i>
<i>eight different directions at once.</i>

1551
01:43:00,522 --> 01:43:03,024
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1552
01:43:03,274 --> 01:43:04,692
Morrie? Him?

1553
01:43:05,235 --> 01:43:08,196
<i>That's when I knew</i>
<i>Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.</i>

1554
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:12,617
<i>That's how it happens. That's how fast</i>
<i>it takes for a guy to get whacked.</i>

1555
01:43:13,284 --> 01:43:15,745
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1556
01:43:15,829 --> 01:43:19,374
Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1557
01:43:19,457 --> 01:43:22,669
Nobody fucking cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1558
01:43:22,877 --> 01:43:25,547
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1559
01:43:25,672 --> 01:43:27,298
- Okay?
- All right.

1560
01:43:29,717 --> 01:43:32,679
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1561
01:43:32,762 --> 01:43:34,806
Stop breaking my balls, all right?

1562
01:43:34,889 --> 01:43:36,850
<i>I was just stalling for time.</i>

1563
01:43:37,517 --> 01:43:41,604
<i>I knew I still had till 8:00 or 9:00</i>
<i>to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.</i>

1564
01:43:41,813 --> 01:43:45,900
<i>But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,</i>
<i>I was going along with the program.</i>

1565
01:43:45,984 --> 01:43:49,779
I pulled his hair out of his fucking head.
I bit him. He's out cold.

1566
01:43:51,906 --> 01:43:54,242
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1567
01:43:54,325 --> 01:43:57,245
I walk away.
We start to go in the fucking joint.

1568
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:00,999
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.

1569
01:44:01,374 --> 01:44:03,251
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1570
01:44:03,334 --> 01:44:07,297
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says...

1571
01:44:08,214 --> 01:44:10,091
I said, "Don't say it."

1572
01:44:14,971 --> 01:44:16,306
"Jerkoff!"

1573
01:44:19,058 --> 01:44:22,645
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him.

1574
01:44:22,729 --> 01:44:25,773
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1575
01:44:25,857 --> 01:44:27,692
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

1576
01:44:27,775 --> 01:44:30,862
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1577
01:44:30,945 --> 01:44:33,948
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1578
01:44:34,032 --> 01:44:36,659
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1579
01:44:37,494 --> 01:44:39,537
<i>It was a load off my mind.</i>

1580
01:44:40,622 --> 01:44:41,915
<i>Poor bastard.</i>

1581
01:44:41,998 --> 01:44:44,417
<i>He never knew how close he'd come</i>
<i>to getting killed.</i>

1582
01:44:44,501 --> 01:44:47,545
<i>Even if I told him,</i>
<i>he would have never believed me.</i>

1583
01:44:49,047 --> 01:44:53,051
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1584
01:44:53,635 --> 01:44:56,971
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
Let's get it over with.

1585
01:44:57,055 --> 01:45:00,099
I've never met a ball buster like you,
my whole life.

1586
01:45:00,183 --> 01:45:02,310
Who loves you more than I do?

1587
01:45:02,393 --> 01:45:05,730
- I'd do anything for you.
- Except to stop busting my balls.

1588
01:45:06,648 --> 01:45:09,108
- Let's go have coffee.
- Want to go to the diner?

1589
01:45:09,192 --> 01:45:11,611
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1590
01:45:12,153 --> 01:45:15,156
- Which diner?
- Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1591
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,450
- They got Danishes?
- They got everything.

1592
01:45:17,534 --> 01:45:19,911
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

1593
01:45:20,495 --> 01:45:24,666
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio...

1594
01:45:32,882 --> 01:45:34,509
I thought he'd never shut up.

1595
01:45:34,592 --> 01:45:36,344
What a pain in the ass.

1596
01:45:36,427 --> 01:45:39,347
- What'll we do with him?
- Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1597
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:41,432
Call me when you're through.

1598
01:45:41,516 --> 01:45:44,018
- Frank, let's chop him up.
- All right.

1599
01:45:44,102 --> 01:45:46,729
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker, you?

1600
01:45:46,813 --> 01:45:47,897
You said chop him up.

1601
01:45:47,981 --> 01:45:51,401
At Charlie's, not here!
Where are you gonna chop him here?

1602
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:55,071
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1603
01:45:55,155 --> 01:45:57,323
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1604
01:45:57,407 --> 01:45:59,242
The car's cold.

1605
01:45:59,325 --> 01:46:02,912
Get the fuck out of here!
What, warm it up? Get out of here!

1606
01:46:03,746 --> 01:46:06,291
- Who is it?
- It's Belle. Open up.

1607
01:46:06,374 --> 01:46:08,084
It's Belle. Let me in.

1608
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,839
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1609
01:46:12,922 --> 01:46:14,257
Calm down.

1610
01:46:14,549 --> 01:46:17,051
He's missing! I know something happened.

1611
01:46:17,135 --> 01:46:19,429
He's probably drunk
and fell asleep somewhere.

1612
01:46:19,512 --> 01:46:23,266
In 27 years, he's never been away all night
without calling.

1613
01:46:23,349 --> 01:46:26,227
I know something's happened.
I know you know.

1614
01:46:26,311 --> 01:46:29,939
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home, then look for him.

1615
01:46:30,106 --> 01:46:33,401
- I've been home! I've been on the phone...
- He's playing cards.

1616
01:46:36,779 --> 01:46:39,324
- What'll I tell Belle?
- Who gives a fuck?

1617
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:43,703
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1618
01:46:43,786 --> 01:46:45,914
- Watch this.
- Don't fuck with them.

1619
01:46:45,997 --> 01:46:48,041
I do it all the time. I'll bust their balls.

1620
01:46:48,124 --> 01:46:51,002
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

1621
01:46:53,463 --> 01:46:55,799
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1622
01:46:57,091 --> 01:46:58,843
Keep them up all night.

1623
01:46:59,761 --> 01:47:01,346
I'll see you later.

1624
01:47:50,979 --> 01:47:54,232
<i>Jimmy was cutting every link</i>
<i>between himself and the robbery...</i>

1625
01:47:54,315 --> 01:47:56,734
<i>but it had nothing to do with me.</i>

1626
01:48:07,245 --> 01:48:10,540
<i>I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me</i>
<i>some Christmas money.</i>

1627
01:48:12,333 --> 01:48:14,752
<i>From then on, I kept my mouth shut.</i>

1628
01:48:14,836 --> 01:48:18,798
<i>I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his.</i>

1629
01:48:18,882 --> 01:48:22,218
<i>He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,</i>
<i>but that was it.</i>

1630
01:48:23,344 --> 01:48:26,848
<i>It made him sick to turn the money over</i>
<i>to the guys who stole it.</i>

1631
01:48:26,931 --> 01:48:29,851
<i>He'd rather whack them.</i>
<i>Anyway, what did I care?</i>

1632
01:48:29,934 --> 01:48:31,853
<i>I wasn't asking for anything.</i>

1633
01:48:31,936 --> 01:48:35,690
<i>And Jimmy was making nice money</i>
<i>through my Pittsburgh connections.</i>

1634
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:40,195
<i>Still, months after the robbery</i>
<i>they were finding bodies all over.</i>

1635
01:49:02,217 --> 01:49:05,053
<i>When they found Carbone</i>
<i>in the meat truck...</i>

1636
01:49:05,136 --> 01:49:06,846
<i>he was frozen so stiff...</i>

1637
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:10,058
<i>it took them two days</i>
<i>to thaw him out for the autopsy.</i>

1638
01:49:14,896 --> 01:49:17,065
<i>Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.</i>

1639
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,110
<i>He was like a kid. We had money</i>
<i>coming in through my Pittsburgh people...</i>

1640
01:49:21,194 --> 01:49:24,739
<i>and even after a while,</i>
<i>the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.</i>

1641
01:49:24,906 --> 01:49:27,158
<i>What made Jimmy so happy</i>
<i>that morning...</i>

1642
01:49:27,242 --> 01:49:30,286
<i>was that this was the day</i>
<i>that Tommy was being made.</i>

1643
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:33,665
<i>Jimmy was so excited,</i>
<i>you'd think he was being made.</i>

1644
01:49:34,249 --> 01:49:36,918
<i>He must have made four calls</i>
<i>to Tommy's house.</i>

1645
01:49:37,085 --> 01:49:41,131
<i>They had a signal set up, so he'd know</i>
<i>the minute the ceremony was over.</i>

1646
01:49:41,923 --> 01:49:44,134
- Ma, where are you?
- Here I am.

1647
01:49:44,759 --> 01:49:47,345
- You're home.
- Home? I'm leaving.

1648
01:49:47,762 --> 01:49:50,390
- You look lovely.
- I look good, huh?

1649
01:49:50,473 --> 01:49:53,893
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1650
01:49:54,561 --> 01:49:57,939
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1651
01:49:58,022 --> 01:49:59,732
- God be with you.
- Bye, Ma.

1652
01:49:59,816 --> 01:50:02,235
<i>We always called each other goodfellas.</i>

1653
01:50:02,318 --> 01:50:04,028
<i>You'd say to somebody:</i>

1654
01:50:04,112 --> 01:50:08,324
<i>"You'll like this guy. He's all right.</i>
<i>He's a goodfella, one of us. "</i>

1655
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:10,076
<i>You understand?</i>

1656
01:50:10,743 --> 01:50:13,079
<i>We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.</i>

1657
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:18,960
<i>But Jimmy and I could never be made</i>
<i>because we had Irish blood.</i>

1658
01:50:19,043 --> 01:50:21,546
<i>It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.</i>

1659
01:50:21,796 --> 01:50:25,800
<i>To become a member of a crew,</i>
<i>you've got to be 100% Italian...</i>

1660
01:50:25,884 --> 01:50:29,179
<i>so they can trace your relatives</i>
<i>back to the old country.</i>

1661
01:50:36,227 --> 01:50:38,646
<i>It's the highest honor they can give you.</i>

1662
01:50:38,730 --> 01:50:41,316
<i>It means you belong</i>
<i>to a family and a crew.</i>

1663
01:50:41,608 --> 01:50:44,152
<i>It means nobody can fuck around</i>
<i>with you.</i>

1664
01:50:44,652 --> 01:50:47,155
<i>It also means you could</i>
<i>fuck around with anybody...</i>

1665
01:50:47,238 --> 01:50:49,741
<i>just as long as they aren't also a member.</i>

1666
01:50:49,824 --> 01:50:53,286
<i>It's like a license to steal.</i>
<i>A license to do anything.</i>

1667
01:50:55,455 --> 01:50:57,499
How many years ago
since you were made?

1668
01:50:57,582 --> 01:51:00,418
- I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
- Thirty years?

1669
01:51:00,502 --> 01:51:04,798
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1670
01:51:08,051 --> 01:51:11,095
<i>As far as Jimmy was concerned,</i>
<i>with Tommy being made...</i>

1671
01:51:11,179 --> 01:51:13,598
<i>it was like we were all being made.</i>

1672
01:51:14,474 --> 01:51:17,143
<i>We would now have</i>
<i>one of our own as a member.</i>

1673
01:51:32,992 --> 01:51:34,661
- Who's this?
<i>- This is Vinnie.</i>

1674
01:51:34,744 --> 01:51:37,664
Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1675
01:51:37,747 --> 01:51:40,834
<i>No, we had a problem.</i>
<i>We tried to do everything we could.</i>

1676
01:51:40,917 --> 01:51:42,001
What do you mean?

1677
01:51:42,085 --> 01:51:46,256
<i>You know what I mean. He's gone,</i>
<i>and we couldn't do nothing about it.</i>

1678
01:51:48,174 --> 01:51:50,093
<i>- That's it.</i>
- What do you mean?

1679
01:51:50,176 --> 01:51:51,553
<i>He's gone.</i>

1680
01:51:53,513 --> 01:51:54,639
<i>That's it.</i>

1681
01:51:59,477 --> 01:52:02,272
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

1682
01:52:12,699 --> 01:52:14,868
- What happened?
- They fucking whacked him.

1683
01:52:14,951 --> 01:52:16,119
Fuck.

1684
01:52:31,968 --> 01:52:33,636
Are you all right?

1685
01:52:40,727 --> 01:52:43,271
<i>It was revenge for Billy Batts...</i>

1686
01:52:43,354 --> 01:52:45,231
<i>and a lot of other things.</i>

1687
01:52:45,315 --> 01:52:46,399
And that's that.

1688
01:52:46,483 --> 01:52:48,985
<i>There was nothing we could do about it.</i>

1689
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:51,779
<i>Batts was a made man</i>
<i>and Tommy wasn't.</i>

1690
01:52:52,405 --> 01:52:54,407
<i>We had to sit still and take it.</i>

1691
01:52:54,491 --> 01:52:57,911
<i>It was among the Italians.</i>
<i>It was real greaseball shit.</i>

1692
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:12,467
<i>They even shot Tommy in the face...</i>

1693
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:16,054
<i>so his mother couldn't give him</i>
<i>an open coffin at the funeral.</i>

1694
01:54:03,393 --> 01:54:06,896
<i>I was gonna be busy all day.</i>
<i>I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...</i>

1695
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:08,815
<i>to match some silencers he had.</i>

1696
01:54:08,898 --> 01:54:11,985
<i>I had to pick up my brother at the hospital</i>
<i>and drive him home.</i>

1697
01:54:12,068 --> 01:54:14,654
<i>I had to pick up</i>
<i>some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...</i>

1698
01:54:14,737 --> 01:54:17,949
<i>to fly down to some customers</i>
<i>I had near Atlanta.</i>

1699
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:32,755
<i>Right away, I knew he didn't want them,</i>
<i>and I'd be stuck for the money.</i>

1700
01:54:32,839 --> 01:54:36,551
<i>I only bought them because</i>
<i>he wanted them, and now he didn't.</i>

1701
01:54:37,302 --> 01:54:40,847
What good are these? None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?

1702
01:54:40,930 --> 01:54:42,223
I'm not paying for it.

1703
01:54:42,307 --> 01:54:45,977
<i>I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was</i>
<i>so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.</i>

1704
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:48,396
Stop the drugs. They're making
your mind into mush!

1705
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:49,981
- You hear me?
- I'll take them back.

1706
01:55:03,703 --> 01:55:05,705
<i>My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.</i>

1707
01:55:05,788 --> 01:55:09,501
<i>Since I would see them in the afternoon</i>
<i>to pick up a delivery...</i>

1708
01:55:09,584 --> 01:55:12,128
<i>I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.</i>

1709
01:55:31,147 --> 01:55:32,315
Oh, my God.

1710
01:55:34,067 --> 01:55:38,154
<i>When I finally got to the hospital,</i>
<i>Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.</i>

1711
01:55:38,238 --> 01:55:40,448
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

1712
01:55:41,407 --> 01:55:43,827
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1713
01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:46,913
<i>And I told him I was partying all night.</i>

1714
01:55:46,996 --> 01:55:48,873
- I'm fine.
- Come on. Get over here.

1715
01:55:48,957 --> 01:55:51,292
- Doc, I'm fine.
- Let me check you out.

1716
01:55:51,584 --> 01:55:52,752
Come on.

1717
01:55:55,755 --> 01:55:58,508
<i>He took mercy on me,</i>
<i>gave me 10 milligrams of Valium...</i>

1718
01:55:58,591 --> 01:56:00,009
<i>and sent me home.</i>

1719
01:56:00,426 --> 01:56:04,139
<i>My plan was to drop off my brother</i>
<i>at the house and pick up Karen.</i>

1720
01:56:06,182 --> 01:56:09,352
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1721
01:56:09,435 --> 01:56:12,981
Right in front of us, there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1722
01:56:13,064 --> 01:56:15,984
- Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts?
- I'm telling you.

1723
01:56:16,067 --> 01:56:17,360
I don't know what's going on.

1724
01:56:17,443 --> 01:56:20,572
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1725
01:56:20,655 --> 01:56:23,116
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1726
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:26,077
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1727
01:56:32,625 --> 01:56:34,210
<i>I was cooking dinner that night.</i>

1728
01:56:35,462 --> 01:56:39,424
<i>I had to start braising the beef</i>
<i>and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.</i>

1729
01:56:41,676 --> 01:56:44,846
<i>It was Michael's favorite.</i>
<i>I was making ziti with meat gravy...</i>

1730
01:56:44,929 --> 01:56:47,640
<i>and I'm planning to roast some peppers</i>
<i>over the flames...</i>

1731
01:56:47,724 --> 01:56:51,769
<i>put on some string beans with olive oil.</i>
<i>I had some beautiful cutlets...</i>

1732
01:56:51,853 --> 01:56:52,979
<i>that were cut just right...</i>

1733
01:56:53,062 --> 01:56:56,107
<i>that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.</i>

1734
01:56:56,316 --> 01:56:58,401
<i>So, I was home for about an hour.</i>

1735
01:56:58,485 --> 01:57:00,487
<i>My plan was to start the dinner early...</i>

1736
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:03,239
<i>so Karen and I could unload the guns</i>
<i>Jimmy didn't want...</i>

1737
01:57:03,323 --> 01:57:04,782
<i>then get the package for Lois...</i>

1738
01:57:04,866 --> 01:57:07,744
<i>to take to Atlanta for her trip</i>
<i>later that night.</i>

1739
01:57:08,328 --> 01:57:12,290
<i>I kept looking out the window,</i>
<i>and I saw that the helicopter was gone.</i>

1740
01:57:12,707 --> 01:57:16,628
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1741
01:57:17,337 --> 01:57:21,299
<i>So I asked my brother to watch the sauce,</i>
<i>and Karen and I started out.</i>

1742
01:57:24,010 --> 01:57:26,095
Oh, God. I see it.

1743
01:57:26,346 --> 01:57:28,848
- I see it. Look, it's right there.
- Damn!

1744
01:57:30,058 --> 01:57:31,559
- That's it.
- There it is.

1745
01:57:31,643 --> 01:57:33,686
We got to get to your mother's.

1746
01:57:33,895 --> 01:57:35,271
See, I told you.

1747
01:57:35,355 --> 01:57:36,731
It's funny.

1748
01:57:37,148 --> 01:57:40,693
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.

1749
01:58:08,429 --> 01:58:12,308
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch
anything outside the house. Nothing.

1750
01:58:12,392 --> 01:58:15,270
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.

1751
01:58:20,817 --> 01:58:22,527
Let's go shopping.

1752
01:58:24,612 --> 01:58:26,823
I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all morning.

1753
01:58:28,116 --> 01:58:29,492
I'm telling you.

1754
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:33,413
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1755
01:58:34,497 --> 01:58:38,334
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1756
01:58:39,919 --> 01:58:41,754
Come on, let's go inside.

1757
01:58:45,842 --> 01:58:47,719
- Yeah, it's gone.
- I don't hear anything.

1758
01:58:47,802 --> 01:58:49,220
Let's go back to your mother's.

1759
01:59:03,151 --> 01:59:05,737
- They all right?
- Beautiful. They're great.

1760
01:59:06,571 --> 01:59:09,282
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1761
01:59:09,365 --> 01:59:10,909
Yeah. I need a hit.

1762
01:59:11,451 --> 01:59:14,913
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1763
01:59:15,121 --> 01:59:18,166
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

1764
01:59:18,625 --> 01:59:23,004
<i>I had to get home and get the package</i>
<i>ready for Lois to take on her trip.</i>

1765
01:59:23,087 --> 01:59:27,091
<i>Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give</i>
<i>the package a whack with quinine.</i>

1766
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:29,636
<i>Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.</i>

1767
01:59:29,719 --> 01:59:33,515
<i>I had the cooking to finish,</i>
<i>and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.</i>

1768
01:59:33,598 --> 01:59:36,643
- It's Sandy. What is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.

1769
01:59:37,894 --> 01:59:39,646
<i>- When are you coming over?</i>
- In an hour.

1770
01:59:39,729 --> 01:59:43,024
<i>- You staying tonight, right?</i>
- I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1771
01:59:43,107 --> 01:59:47,153
Come on, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.

1772
01:59:54,786 --> 01:59:56,788
- Hello?
<i>- It's me. You ready?</i>

1773
01:59:57,789 --> 02:00:01,126
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Keep stirring it.

1774
02:00:01,209 --> 02:00:05,130
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.

1775
02:00:05,213 --> 02:00:07,132
<i>- Listen, you know what to do?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

1776
02:00:07,215 --> 02:00:09,509
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois.
This is important.

1777
02:00:09,592 --> 02:00:12,137
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1778
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:15,473
Understand me?
Call from an outside line. I mean it.

1779
02:00:15,557 --> 02:00:19,310
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why
are you bugging me? I know what to do.

1780
02:00:19,394 --> 02:00:22,105
You little hick, just make sure you do it.

1781
02:00:22,188 --> 02:00:23,273
<i>You can be such a pain.</i>

1782
02:00:23,356 --> 02:00:27,277
<i>- Hey! Just do it!</i>
- Okay.

1783
02:00:28,027 --> 02:00:32,574
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1784
02:00:33,908 --> 02:00:36,119
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

1785
02:00:36,202 --> 02:00:38,580
<i>What does she do</i>
<i>after she hangs up with me?</i>

1786
02:00:38,663 --> 02:00:42,250
<i>After everything I told her?</i>
<i>After all her "yeah, yeah"bullshit?</i>

1787
02:00:42,333 --> 02:00:45,044
<i>She picks up the phone</i>
<i>and calls from the house.</i>

1788
02:00:45,128 --> 02:00:47,505
<i>If anybody was listening,</i>
<i>they'd know everything.</i>

1789
02:00:47,589 --> 02:00:49,632
<i>They'd know a package</i>
<i>was leaving my house...</i>

1790
02:00:49,716 --> 02:00:53,303
<i>and they'd even have the time and</i>
<i>flight number, thanks to her.</i>

1791
02:00:54,929 --> 02:00:56,890
<i>As soon as I got home, I started cooking.</i>

1792
02:00:56,973 --> 02:00:59,142
<i>I had a few hours until Lois' flight.</i>

1793
02:00:59,225 --> 02:01:01,394
<i>I told my brother to watch the stove.</i>

1794
02:01:01,478 --> 02:01:05,231
<i>All day long the guy's been watching</i>
<i>helicopters and tomato sauce.</i>

1795
02:01:06,065 --> 02:01:10,695
<i>I had to drive over to Sandy's,</i>
<i>mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.</i>

1796
02:01:21,873 --> 02:01:25,001
Do you think you can come over here,
fuck me, and leave?

1797
02:01:25,084 --> 02:01:27,212
- Come on.
- You got someplace better to go?

1798
02:01:27,295 --> 02:01:29,839
Don't talk like that. Come on.

1799
02:01:30,215 --> 02:01:32,050
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.

1800
02:01:32,133 --> 02:01:33,426
You believe me?

1801
02:01:34,594 --> 02:01:36,054
Do you believe me?

1802
02:01:36,304 --> 02:01:37,764
Do you believe me?

1803
02:01:39,724 --> 02:01:41,476
- That the last one?
- Yeah.

1804
02:01:51,069 --> 02:01:53,404
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you!

1805
02:02:00,119 --> 02:02:03,998
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1806
02:02:04,082 --> 02:02:06,417
from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1807
02:02:06,501 --> 02:02:08,920
- I have to.
- You don't have to.

1808
02:02:13,842 --> 02:02:15,301
I got to go home.

1809
02:02:17,345 --> 02:02:19,347
What do you mean, you got to go home?

1810
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:20,807
I've been carrying this all day.

1811
02:02:20,890 --> 02:02:23,601
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1812
02:02:23,685 --> 02:02:25,770
I got to go home and get my hat.

1813
02:02:26,521 --> 02:02:29,149
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?

1814
02:02:29,315 --> 02:02:32,152
So I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1815
02:02:32,235 --> 02:02:36,239
I need it, I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.

1816
02:02:36,406 --> 02:02:40,410
Lois, do you understand
what we are involved in here?

1817
02:02:40,869 --> 02:02:43,913
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1818
02:02:48,835 --> 02:02:52,422
<i>What could I do if she insisted</i>
<i>I drive her home for her goddamn hat?</i>

1819
02:02:52,505 --> 02:02:55,383
<i>I hid the package in the kitchen</i>
<i>and went to take her home.</i>

1820
02:02:55,467 --> 02:02:56,593
A hat?

1821
02:03:05,685 --> 02:03:07,312
What the fuck is this?

1822
02:03:07,479 --> 02:03:10,106
Police! Freeze! Don't you move,
you motherfucker...

1823
02:03:10,190 --> 02:03:13,318
or I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off slowly.

1824
02:03:17,238 --> 02:03:19,324
<i>For a second, I thought I was dead.</i>

1825
02:03:19,407 --> 02:03:21,993
<i>But when I heard all the noise,</i>
<i>I knew they were cops.</i>

1826
02:03:22,076 --> 02:03:23,786
<i>Only cops talk that way.</i>

1827
02:03:23,995 --> 02:03:25,205
Don't fucking move.

1828
02:03:25,288 --> 02:03:28,792
<i>If they had been wiseguys,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have heard a thing.</i>

1829
02:03:29,667 --> 02:03:31,377
<i>I would have been dead.</i>

1830
02:03:32,337 --> 02:03:34,047
Michael, lock the door!

1831
02:03:58,279 --> 02:04:01,282
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar?

1832
02:04:01,366 --> 02:04:03,034
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.

1833
02:04:03,117 --> 02:04:06,871
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't really give a fuck.

1834
02:04:06,955 --> 02:04:11,167
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1835
02:04:11,251 --> 02:04:13,378
<i>All day I thought the guys</i>
<i>in the helicopter...</i>

1836
02:04:13,461 --> 02:04:18,091
<i>were local cops busting my balls over</i>
<i>Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.</i>

1837
02:04:18,174 --> 02:04:19,300
Just get the lawyer.

1838
02:04:19,384 --> 02:04:23,054
<i>They'd been on me a month.</i>
<i>Phone taps, surveillance, everything.</i>

1839
02:04:23,138 --> 02:04:25,890
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1840
02:04:25,974 --> 02:04:29,519
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a problem all night.

1841
02:04:29,727 --> 02:04:33,690
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

1842
02:04:33,773 --> 02:04:38,361
Twenty-five fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1843
02:04:39,112 --> 02:04:41,406
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1844
02:04:42,782 --> 02:04:46,619
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1845
02:04:46,870 --> 02:04:49,038
You got anything good in there?

1846
02:04:50,748 --> 02:04:51,916
Is it good?

1847
02:04:56,921 --> 02:04:58,465
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1848
02:05:01,593 --> 02:05:03,052
See you in Attica, dick.

1849
02:05:03,636 --> 02:05:06,848
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1850
02:05:07,307 --> 02:05:10,727
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1851
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:12,312
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

1852
02:05:12,395 --> 02:05:15,773
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1853
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:18,234
Then you're better off staying in here.

1854
02:05:18,318 --> 02:05:21,946
They could whack me in here as easy
as outside, maybe even easier.

1855
02:05:22,030 --> 02:05:23,781
They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1856
02:05:23,865 --> 02:05:28,203
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1857
02:05:28,286 --> 02:05:32,957
<i>Karen finally got her mother to put</i>
<i>her house up for my bail and I was out.</i>

1858
02:05:33,041 --> 02:05:37,170
<i>I remember I had this feeling</i>
<i>I would be killed right outside the jail.</i>

1859
02:05:37,587 --> 02:05:40,840
<i>I knew Paulie was still pissed at me,</i>
<i>and he's such a hothead.</i>

1860
02:05:40,924 --> 02:05:42,759
<i>And I was worried about Jimmy.</i>

1861
02:05:42,842 --> 02:05:47,138
<i>See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out</i>
<i>he was into drug deals with me...</i>

1862
02:05:47,847 --> 02:05:50,892
<i>Paulie would have Jimmy whacked</i>
<i>even before me.</i>

1863
02:05:52,602 --> 02:05:54,229
<i>This is the bad time.</i>

1864
02:05:55,104 --> 02:05:57,357
<i>I didn't feel safe until I got home.</i>

1865
02:05:59,192 --> 02:06:03,029
<i>Now my plan was to stay alive</i>
<i>long enough to sell off the dope...</i>

1866
02:06:03,112 --> 02:06:07,700
<i>the cops never found, then disappear</i>
<i>until I can get things straightened out.</i>

1867
02:06:09,285 --> 02:06:10,411
Fuck!

1868
02:06:10,495 --> 02:06:14,249
- Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
- I flushed it down the toilet.

1869
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,085
You what?

1870
02:06:17,544 --> 02:06:20,213
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.

1871
02:06:20,296 --> 02:06:24,467
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1872
02:06:24,551 --> 02:06:27,303
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!

1873
02:06:27,387 --> 02:06:31,850
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1874
02:06:32,350 --> 02:06:35,228
I had to. They were going to find it!

1875
02:06:35,311 --> 02:06:39,315
- They would have never found it!
- They would have, I swear to you!

1876
02:06:40,733 --> 02:06:42,402
They would've found it!

1877
02:06:43,862 --> 02:06:45,363
Why did you do that?

1878
02:06:45,446 --> 02:06:49,033
- They would have found it.
- Why did you do that, Karen?

1879
02:06:50,243 --> 02:06:52,203
Oh, my God!

1880
02:06:52,662 --> 02:06:55,582
- I had to do it.
- Oh, my God.

1881
02:07:31,743 --> 02:07:33,661
<i>Paulie, I'm really sorry.</i>

1882
02:07:36,331 --> 02:07:39,167
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1883
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:40,919
Yeah, you fucked up.

1884
02:07:44,589 --> 02:07:46,508
But I'm all right now.

1885
02:07:48,092 --> 02:07:52,514
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1886
02:07:52,597 --> 02:07:54,933
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1887
02:07:56,100 --> 02:07:58,269
You treated me like a fucking jerk.

1888
02:07:58,853 --> 02:08:00,438
Like I was never nothing to you.

1889
02:08:00,522 --> 02:08:03,399
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1890
02:08:04,526 --> 02:08:06,903
You know, I was ashamed.

1891
02:08:09,948 --> 02:08:11,908
I'm ashamed now.

1892
02:08:15,245 --> 02:08:17,580
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

1893
02:08:20,625 --> 02:08:24,963
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help. I really do.

1894
02:08:31,136 --> 02:08:32,220
Take this.

1895
02:08:47,277 --> 02:08:49,779
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1896
02:08:59,789 --> 02:09:01,458
<i>$3,200.</i>

1897
02:09:02,041 --> 02:09:06,045
<i>That's what he gave me.</i>
<i>$3,200 for a lifetime.</i>

1898
02:09:06,963 --> 02:09:09,299
<i>It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.</i>

1899
02:09:09,382 --> 02:09:11,468
<i>- We got to get out.</i>
<i>- I don't want to run.</i>

1900
02:09:11,551 --> 02:09:15,972
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1901
02:09:16,389 --> 02:09:18,975
I don't want to do that.
Is that what you want?

1902
02:09:19,058 --> 02:09:21,227
If we stay around here, we're dead.

1903
02:09:21,978 --> 02:09:23,813
You got it? We're dead.

1904
02:09:24,481 --> 02:09:25,732
They're right.

1905
02:09:26,065 --> 02:09:29,319
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.

1906
02:09:32,530 --> 02:09:34,491
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

1907
02:09:34,574 --> 02:09:35,700
He's okay.

1908
02:09:36,826 --> 02:09:38,369
They sobered him up.

1909
02:09:38,578 --> 02:09:40,747
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

1910
02:09:44,542 --> 02:09:47,003
You know what kind of questions
they're asking him?

1911
02:09:47,086 --> 02:09:48,713
Jimmy, I don't know.

1912
02:09:49,798 --> 02:09:53,343
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...

1913
02:09:53,885 --> 02:09:56,554
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1914
02:09:56,638 --> 02:09:58,848
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

1915
02:09:59,557 --> 02:10:03,186
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1916
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:07,190
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1917
02:10:07,273 --> 02:10:10,443
- Take this. It's a couple of thousands.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

1918
02:10:10,610 --> 02:10:12,612
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1919
02:10:12,695 --> 02:10:16,032
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1920
02:10:16,282 --> 02:10:18,159
Pick out a few for yourself.

1921
02:10:18,952 --> 02:10:20,870
- For my mom.
- Yeah, whatever.

1922
02:10:21,037 --> 02:10:23,790
No. It's over here.
In the store on the corner.

1923
02:10:23,873 --> 02:10:26,459
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1924
02:10:32,257 --> 02:10:34,134
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1925
02:10:34,217 --> 02:10:36,052
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Don't worry.

1926
02:10:36,136 --> 02:10:38,847
- I'll try.
- Don't forget, he's got to call me.

1927
02:10:41,349 --> 02:10:43,560
- Over here?
- Right down there.

1928
02:10:58,575 --> 02:11:00,618
It's over there, on the corner.

1929
02:11:00,910 --> 02:11:02,203
Right there.

1930
02:11:36,404 --> 02:11:38,615
No, go ahead. It's right in there.

1931
02:11:38,698 --> 02:11:40,783
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

1932
02:11:41,117 --> 02:11:43,995
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1933
02:11:44,078 --> 02:11:45,622
I'll come back later!

1934
02:12:08,061 --> 02:12:09,687
Karen!

1935
02:12:14,192 --> 02:12:15,443
What happened?

1936
02:12:16,653 --> 02:12:17,779
Nothing.

1937
02:12:18,279 --> 02:12:20,448
- What happened?
- I just got scared.

1938
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:24,911
Got the keys?

1939
02:12:26,579 --> 02:12:30,291
- What happened, Karen?
- I just got scared. It's okay.

1940
02:12:30,375 --> 02:12:32,127
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1941
02:12:38,883 --> 02:12:43,471
<i>If you're part of a crew, nobody ever</i>
<i>tells you they're going to kill you.</i>

1942
02:12:44,013 --> 02:12:45,849
<i>It doesn't happen that way.</i>

1943
02:12:45,932 --> 02:12:49,435
<i>There aren't any arguments</i>
<i>or curses like in the movies.</i>

1944
02:12:49,519 --> 02:12:53,690
<i>Your murderers come with smiles.</i>
<i>They come as your friends.</i>

1945
02:12:53,773 --> 02:12:55,859
<i>People who cared for you all your life.</i>

1946
02:12:55,942 --> 02:13:00,363
<i>They always seem to come when you're</i>
<i>weakest and most in need of their help.</i>

1947
02:13:00,697 --> 02:13:03,950
<i>So I met Jimmy in a crowded place</i>
<i>we both knew.</i>

1948
02:13:04,325 --> 02:13:08,329
<i>I got there 15 minutes early,</i>
<i>and Jimmy was already there.</i>

1949
02:13:08,746 --> 02:13:13,168
<i>He took the booth near the window</i>
<i>so he could see everyone who drove up.</i>

1950
02:13:13,501 --> 02:13:15,879
<i>He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.</i>

1951
02:13:16,296 --> 02:13:19,174
<i>He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.</i>

1952
02:13:20,216 --> 02:13:23,303
<i>On the surface,</i>
<i>everything was supposed to be fine.</i>

1953
02:13:23,386 --> 02:13:25,805
<i>We were supposed to be discussing</i>
<i>my case.</i>

1954
02:13:25,889 --> 02:13:30,852
<i>But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying</i>
<i>to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.</i>

1955
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:36,232
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1956
02:13:36,441 --> 02:13:38,234
Now you understand?

1957
02:13:40,904 --> 02:13:44,449
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

1958
02:13:47,410 --> 02:13:51,664
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1959
02:13:54,083 --> 02:13:58,630
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1960
02:14:01,090 --> 02:14:03,343
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

1961
02:14:04,928 --> 02:14:06,513
Know what I'm saying?

1962
02:14:11,267 --> 02:14:14,938
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1963
02:14:17,524 --> 02:14:18,775
No, not at all.

1964
02:14:20,401 --> 02:14:22,195
That way they got nothing.

1965
02:14:30,829 --> 02:14:33,748
<i>Jimmy had never asked me</i>
<i>to whack somebody before.</i>

1966
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:37,794
<i>But now he's asking me to go to Florida</i>
<i>and do a hit with Anthony.</i>

1967
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:49,055
<i>That's when I knew I would never</i>
<i>have come back from Florida alive.</i>

1968
02:15:02,986 --> 02:15:06,322
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1969
02:15:06,406 --> 02:15:08,575
I don't want to go any place cold.

1970
02:15:09,284 --> 02:15:11,703
You don't have a choice in that matter.

1971
02:15:11,828 --> 02:15:14,372
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1972
02:15:15,165 --> 02:15:17,876
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to...

1973
02:15:17,959 --> 02:15:19,794
He's bronchial, that's why.

1974
02:15:19,878 --> 02:15:22,505
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

1975
02:15:22,589 --> 02:15:24,883
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1976
02:15:24,966 --> 02:15:28,720
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1977
02:15:29,721 --> 02:15:30,889
What about them?

1978
02:15:30,972 --> 02:15:33,975
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1979
02:15:34,726 --> 02:15:37,353
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

1980
02:15:37,812 --> 02:15:38,897
No.

1981
02:15:39,981 --> 02:15:43,318
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

1982
02:15:43,693 --> 02:15:47,780
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

1983
02:15:47,864 --> 02:15:50,867
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

1984
02:15:51,367 --> 02:15:53,578
if there's extraordinary circumstances...

1985
02:15:53,661 --> 02:15:56,539
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

1986
02:15:57,665 --> 02:15:59,417
I can't leave my parents.

1987
02:16:00,668 --> 02:16:02,879
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

1988
02:16:04,130 --> 02:16:07,675
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

1989
02:16:09,469 --> 02:16:11,262
I can't do it without you.

1990
02:16:11,554 --> 02:16:15,642
So, you do whatever, but... that's it.

1991
02:16:17,185 --> 02:16:19,896
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.

1992
02:16:20,063 --> 02:16:22,690
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

1993
02:16:22,816 --> 02:16:26,152
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

1994
02:16:26,236 --> 02:16:28,029
They want Henry, not me.

1995
02:16:28,112 --> 02:16:31,616
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

1996
02:16:32,116 --> 02:16:35,620
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

1997
02:16:35,703 --> 02:16:38,206
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger...

1998
02:16:38,289 --> 02:16:40,792
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me...

1999
02:16:40,875 --> 02:16:42,335
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2000
02:16:42,418 --> 02:16:47,090
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2001
02:16:47,173 --> 02:16:50,844
<i>Conversation after conversation</i>
<i>you talked to Henry on the phone.</i>

2002
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:57,767
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2003
02:16:57,851 --> 02:17:01,312
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2004
02:17:01,896 --> 02:17:03,815
He knows it and you know it.

2005
02:17:05,275 --> 02:17:07,026
What about the kids and school?

2006
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:09,654
<i>Will they get left back?</i>
<i>I mean, what goes on?</i>

2007
02:17:09,737 --> 02:17:12,198
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2008
02:17:12,323 --> 02:17:14,784
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2009
02:17:14,993 --> 02:17:18,037
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2010
02:17:18,872 --> 02:17:22,625
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2011
02:17:26,546 --> 02:17:29,257
<i>This morning you told the jury</i>
<i>about your background.</i>

2012
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:31,426
<i>It was easy for us to disappear.</i>

2013
02:17:31,718 --> 02:17:33,928
<i>My house</i>
<i>was in my mother-in-law's name.</i>

2014
02:17:34,012 --> 02:17:36,055
<i>My cars were registered to my wife.</i>

2015
02:17:36,139 --> 02:17:39,642
<i>My Social Security cards</i>
<i>and driver's licenses were phonies.</i>

2016
02:17:39,767 --> 02:17:42,103
<i>I never voted or paid taxes.</i>

2017
02:17:42,687 --> 02:17:47,233
<i>My birth certificate and arrest sheet was</i>
<i>all you'd ever have to know I was alive.</i>

2018
02:17:47,317 --> 02:17:49,986
- Do you see him here in this courtroom?
- Yes.

2019
02:17:50,278 --> 02:17:52,906
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2020
02:17:55,283 --> 02:17:59,913
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2021
02:18:01,039 --> 02:18:04,125
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2022
02:18:04,459 --> 02:18:06,836
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.

2023
02:18:07,045 --> 02:18:09,255
Can you point him out for the jury?

2024
02:18:10,924 --> 02:18:15,136
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2025
02:18:16,346 --> 02:18:18,139
Your Honor, I have a document...

2026
02:18:18,223 --> 02:18:20,642
<i>The hardest thing was leaving the life.</i>

2027
02:18:21,392 --> 02:18:23,019
<i>I still love the life.</i>

2028
02:18:23,311 --> 02:18:25,480
<i>We were treated like movie stars</i>
<i>with muscle.</i>

2029
02:18:25,563 --> 02:18:27,732
<i>We had it all, just for the asking.</i>

2030
02:18:27,816 --> 02:18:31,152
<i>Our wives, mothers, kids,</i>
<i>everybody rode along.</i>

2031
02:18:31,486 --> 02:18:34,697
<i>I had paper bags filled with jewelry</i>
<i>stashed in the kitchen.</i>

2032
02:18:34,781 --> 02:18:37,158
<i>I had a sugar bowl full of coke</i>
<i>next to the bed.</i>

2033
02:18:37,242 --> 02:18:41,121
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2034
02:18:41,204 --> 02:18:43,331
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.

2035
02:18:43,414 --> 02:18:46,584
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it.

2036
02:18:47,418 --> 02:18:49,003
Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence...

2037
02:18:49,087 --> 02:18:51,381
<i>Anything I wanted was a phone call away.</i>

2038
02:18:51,464 --> 02:18:55,009
<i>Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats</i>
<i>all over the city.</i>

2039
02:18:55,093 --> 02:18:57,679
<i>I'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend...</i>

2040
02:18:57,762 --> 02:19:01,933
<i>then blow the winnings in a week</i>
<i>or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.</i>

2041
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:03,518
It didn't matter.

2042
02:19:03,852 --> 02:19:08,731
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2043
02:19:09,149 --> 02:19:10,608
We ran everything.

2044
02:19:11,067 --> 02:19:15,363
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2045
02:19:15,613 --> 02:19:19,117
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2046
02:19:21,161 --> 02:19:22,787
And now it's all over.

2047
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:25,290
<i>That's the hardest part.</i>

2048
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:27,709
<i>Today everything is different.</i>

2049
02:19:27,792 --> 02:19:32,005
<i>There's no action.</i>
<i>I have to wait around like everyone else.</i>

2050
02:19:32,380 --> 02:19:34,174
<i>Can't even get decent food.</i>

2051
02:19:34,924 --> 02:19:38,136
<i>After I got here I ordered spaghetti</i>
<i>with marinara sauce...</i>

2052
02:19:38,219 --> 02:19:40,388
<i>and I got egg noodles and ketchup.</i>

2053
02:19:40,889 --> 02:19:42,515
<i>I'm an average nobody.</i>

2054
02:19:43,766 --> 02:19:46,644
<i>I get to live the rest of my life</i>
<i>like a schnook.</i>
