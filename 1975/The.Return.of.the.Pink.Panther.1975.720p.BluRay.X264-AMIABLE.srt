1
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:49,509
This way, please. Ladies
and gentlemen, this way, please.

2
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:53,138
Follow me.

3
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:58,268
Round there, please.

4
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,604
Thank you.

5
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:13,825
From the dynasty
of Akbar the Magnificent,

6
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:18,288
and for over a thousand years,
our nation's religious symbol,

7
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:19,957
the Pink Panther.

8
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,293
Largest and most famous diamond
in the world.

9
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:28,006
Irreplaceable, its value cannot
be estimated in terms of money.

10
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:31,260
Isn't the museum worried
that someone might steal it?

11
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,929
The Pink Panther is protected,

12
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:37,766
and by forces
more impenetrable than any army.

13
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:39,893
Observe.

14
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:47,693
Deactivate.

15
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:51,822
Failing the radar shield,

16
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,909
the slightest release of pressure
in the weight of the diamond,

17
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:59,788
and the would-be thief is a prisoner.

18
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:02,749
A prisoner of the Pink Panther.

19
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,217
Why is it called the Pink Panther?

20
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:14,928
The stone is flawed.

21
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:18,098
If it is held up to the light
in a certain way,

22
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:22,394
the figure of a springing panther
can be seen clearly.

23
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,369
- Good morning, sir.
- Sit.

24
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,874
My department has already
begun rounding up suspects.

25
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,293
His Majesty has been
informed of the theft.

26
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,295
He is flying home from Washington.

27
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,840
- I expect an arrest any moment now.
- I do not share your optimism.

28
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,301
We know the culprit
is within our borders.

29
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:10,429
All airports and railway stations
are being watched.

30
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,640
While your men search for this man
with the Dutch passport

31
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,852
who rented the hotel room,
he has thrown away his passport

32
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,272
and is making ready to leave
the country under a new identity.

33
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,775
- When we find the fingerprints...
- If you find them...

34
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:29,281
You are both in trouble. But if we do
what is necessary and conventional.

35
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,074
I am calling in outside help.

36
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,276
The famous French detective
who recovered the Pink Panther

37
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:36,360
the last time it was stolen.

38
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,291
- What was his name?
- Clouseau.

39
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,420
Inspector Clouseau.

40
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,277
- Do you have a licence?
- Monsieur?

41
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,448
City ordinance 47-B
prohibits the playing

42
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:15,077
of any musical instrument
in a public place for the purpose

43
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,663
of commercial enterprise
without a licence.

44
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,247
I don't understand.

45
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:23,543
It is against the law for you
to play your musical instrument.

46
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,128
- The leur?
- What?

47
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,005
You say it's against the law?

48
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,341
Yes, unless you have a proper licence.

49
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,926
What kind of licence?

50
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:35,514
A licence that permits the playing
of any musical instrument

51
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,559
in a public place for the purpose
of commercial enterprise.

52
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,478
- Commercial enterprise?
- Yes.

53
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,231
You play that thing
and people give you the money.

54
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,900
People give the monkey the money.

55
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,320
- It is the same.
- Not at all, monsieur.

56
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,782
I am a musician
and the monkey is a businessman.

57
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,826
He doesn't tell me what to play,

58
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,328
and I don't tell him
what to do with his money.

59
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,747
Monsieur, don't try to be funny with me.

60
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,750
He is your monkey,
therefore it is your money!

61
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,420
He lives with me,
but he is not my monkey.

62
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,589
One day I came home and
found him in the living room!

63
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,509
I let him stay, but he pays
for his own room and board.

64
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,761
Then the monkey's breaking the law.

65
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,974
But he doesn't play
any musical instrument.

66
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:23,687
City ordinance 132-R
prohibits the begging.

67
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,857
How do you know so much
about city ordinances?

68
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,151
What sort of stupid question is that,

69
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,153
- are you blind?
- Yes.

70
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,115
Oh, I see, yes. Yes, of course.

71
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,784
You happen to be talking
to a police officer,

72
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,328
and because I expect
to be transferred back

73
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,998
to the Detective Division at any moment,

74
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,625
I will let you off this time
with just a warning.

75
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,669
Thank you, Monsieur Agent.

76
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:50,547
But you must get yourself
a proper licence.

77
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,257
First thing tomorrow.

78
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,468
Try to do something
about your filthy monkey.

79
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,892
Halt! Just a moment!

80
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,686
Move, move!

81
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,355
Over there! <i>Arretez!</i>

82
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:12,861
Idiot!

83
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,779
How was I to know
he was the bank manager?

84
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,948
How were you to know
the bank was being robbed?

85
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,034
- That is correct.
- What is correct?

86
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,494
I did not know the bank was being robbed

87
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:25,582
because I was engaged
in my sworn duty as a police officer.

88
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,502
You didn't even arrest the old beggar.

89
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,505
There was some question
as to whether the beggar

90
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,507
or his minkey was breaking the law.

91
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:35,967
- "Minkey"?
- What?

92
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,218
You said "minkey"!

93
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,888
That is correct, yes, chimpanzee monkey.

94
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,599
So I let them both off with a warning.

95
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,019
The beggar
was the lookout man for the gang.

96
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,229
- That is impossible.
- Why?

97
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,066
He was blind.
How can a blind man be a lookout?

98
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,401
How can an idiot be a policeman? Answer!

99
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,737
It's simple, all he has to do is enlist.

100
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,238
Shut up!

101
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,243
- How do you know he was blind?
- Because he told me so.

102
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,537
Oh, he told you so.
And you believed him?

103
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,414
I had no reason to doubt him.

104
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,001
Do you believe me if I tell you

105
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,004
that I'm not going to get you
suspended for six months?

106
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,799
- Do you believe me?
- If you say so, sir. Yes.

107
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,176
Because I'm a bigger liar
than the beggar.

108
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,720
You are suspended
for six months without pay.

109
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,431
- Six months?
- Effective immediately.

110
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,517
Have you anything to say?

111
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,812
Could you lend me 50 francs?

112
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,855
Will you get out of my sight!

113
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,900
- Yes.
- Idiot.

114
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,072
My blood pressure.

115
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,241
Idiot.

116
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,369
One day, François.

117
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,497
One day I'll be rid of him forever.
That'll be the day.

118
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:52,001
- Something on your mind?
- An order from the commissioner.

119
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,838
- Oh, yes?
- It concerns Clouseau.

120
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,214
Yes? Go on.

121
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,883
He is to be reinstated as an inspector.

122
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,053
What? You can't be serious.

123
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:08,101
And he is to report immediately
to a Colonel Sharki in Lugash.

124
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,228
I see.

125
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,570
- Sir!
- What?

126
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,281
It's a birthday gift from my wife.

127
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,576
Most realistic.

128
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,579
Get me the commissioner.

129
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,669
Chief Inspector Dreyfus calling.

130
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,589
The commissioner.

131
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,883
Commissioner,

132
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:44,345
I have just received your instructions
to send Clouseau to Lugash,

133
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:48,016
but you see, he's no longer
with the Sûreté, I've just given him...

134
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,309
Yes, but...

135
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:54,022
Yes, but since France and Lugash
have been allies for nearly 200 years,

136
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,066
it might be a serious mistake
to send someone who is...

137
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,569
I see. Yes, of course.

138
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,989
Very good, commissioner.

139
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:12,040
It seems the Shah of Lugash
telephoned the president personally

140
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,543
and asked for Clouseau
to be assigned to the case.

141
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,091
- The Shah of Lugash.
- Incredible.

142
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,093
All right, François.

143
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,352
The Shah of Lugash.

144
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,920
<i>...the capital earlier this
morning. It seems that the army...</i>

145
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,178
<i>by sealing the area
around the president's palace.</i>

146
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,139
<i>Highs for the coast...</i>

147
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,266
Oh, good evening, Madame Landlord.

148
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,310
<i>...against the price increases...</i>

149
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,064
Good evening. I was just reading
the headlines in your newspaper.

150
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,693
<i>...opposition</i> is...

151
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,112
Good evening.

152
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,288
Cato?

153
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,624
Cato!

154
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,897
Monsieur Clouseau's residence.

155
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,732
One moment, please.

156
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,819
For you. Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

157
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,710
- Yes, sir.
- <i>You're back on the force.</i>

158
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,129
Come to my office... immediately!

159
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,008
Immediately, sir.

160
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,595
Well, Cato, I am back on the force.

161
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:44,478
You know, Cato,
your freezer ambush ploy...

162
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,689
I really congratulate you.

163
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,607
It was very, very good.

164
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,778
But Cato, your fly is undone.

165
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,368
And so, my friend, are you!

166
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,299
Yes, my little yellow friend.

167
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,968
I knew the chief
would have to reconsider.

168
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:20,306
He did not get where he is
by ignoring a man's qualifications.

169
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,768
He knows that I am unique
and therefore indispensable.

170
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,437
We are much the same, the chief and I.

171
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,565
But of course, Cato,
all great detectives

172
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,318
have one thing in common.
You know what that is?

173
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,236
Instinct.

174
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:38,616
That rare ability to know immediately
without having to stop and reason.

175
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:43,120
And in my business it can easily mean
the difference between life and death.

176
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,456
All right, I'll get it.

177
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,170
Thank you.

178
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:58,344
Yes, that split-second timing
when instinct tells you...

179
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,012
that...

180
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,348
Ah... Aghh!

181
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,225
<i>...new wave of assassinations.</i>

182
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,648
<i>...the opposition spokesman
has categorically denied...</i>

183
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,483
Infamous powers are at work.

184
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,028
The instant you assign me to a case,
the underworld hears about it

185
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,072
and I am set upon.

186
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,490
Cato is in hospital.

187
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,661
They nearly blew his yellow skin off.
It's amazing that I am still alive.

188
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,704
Amazing is not the word.

189
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:30,084
Do I detect something in your voice
that says I am in disfavour with you?

190
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,460
Yes.

191
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,420
I wish you were dead.

192
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,631
You are entitled to your opinion.

193
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,050
And you are not! Out! Out of my sight!

194
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,219
You want me to leave?

195
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,972
If you are not out
of this room in five seconds,

196
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,349
I shall not be responsible
for my actions!

197
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,394
Five seconds is nothing,
I can easily be out in three.

198
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,480
- But if you really want me to leave...
- I've had enough!

199
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,066
Oh, thank you very much.

200
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,989
A very amusing clever little gadget.

201
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,450
Very realistic, but, of course,
my instinct told me that...

202
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,582
Something the matter?
You're not feeling well?

203
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,418
My blood pressure.

204
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,795
Must take my pill. You're killing me.

205
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,589
Yes. Perhaps some water.

206
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,346
You have a defective carafe.
Allow me to blot you.

207
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,432
- Idiot!
- I will blot you.

208
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,351
I had an aunt who suffered
from high blood pressure.

209
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,105
She was attended successfully
by Dr August Balls of Nice.

210
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,318
And after he had attended her
for several weeks, she... Oh.

211
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,159
Obviously, out of fluid.

212
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,871
Perhaps you would like me
to fill it for you?

213
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,711
Now just... just... Please just go away.

214
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,463
Yes.

215
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,214
Well, all right, inspector.

216
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,092
I will leave, but remember,

217
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,054
I will be at your service night or day.

218
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,349
Of course, I will be
on assignment in Lugash.

219
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,895
Fortunately there is,
I believe, some difference in time.

220
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,816
My watch seems to have stopped,
probably due to the explosion.

221
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,738
You need a new flint.

222
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:29,411
Well, chief inspector, until we
meet again and the case is solv-ed.

223
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,667
"The case is solv-ed!" Idiot!

224
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,148
Don’t just stand there, idiot.

225
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:02,820
Call a doctor,
and then help me find my nose!

226
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,041
Inspector!

227
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,546
A very interesting museum you have here.

228
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,343
- Inspector...
- Please tell me nothing.

229
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,763
I prefer to investigate the
scene of the crime spontaneously.

230
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,558
That way it gives my
trained instincts full rein.

231
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,643
But our security measures...

232
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,271
I'm sure your security measures
are very good.

233
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,815
But, obviously not good enough.

234
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,317
Let me see...

235
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,451
Yes, very effective.
Very effective, indeed.

236
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,953
The element of surprise.

237
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,122
Of course, I knew it would happen.

238
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,457
Nevertheless, the element of surprise.

239
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,752
How very kind of you to welcome me.

240
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,845
Is there any way of getting
in and out of this place

241
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,889
- without this happening all the time?
- Deactivate it.

242
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,058
Deactivate the door.

243
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,360
Hmm.

244
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,240
Yes...

245
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,287
Oh.

246
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:44,838
Ugh. So we meet again.

247
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:27,339
- Very ingenious.
- He pulled himself across the floor.

248
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,590
He did?

249
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,801
How else could he avoid the radar field?

250
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,179
Yes, how else? Hmm.

251
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:38,100
Of course, he would need
a very slippery floor to do that.

252
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,520
- Therefore, the wax.
- The wax? Aah!

253
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,065
Are you all right?

254
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:49,027
'Course I am all right.
I am examining the wax.

255
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,909
Have you taken a sample of this wax?

256
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,871
- Wax is wax.
- Well, this is where you are wrong.

257
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,873
Wax is not just wax.

258
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,834
In this case it is a clue.

259
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,879
English wax, French wax, domestic wax...

260
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,759
The inspector is right.
Have the wax tested immediately.

261
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:17,597
It is my guess that
you will find it is English wax.

262
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,017
- Why?
- Because your thief is an Englishman.

263
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,602
How do you know that?

264
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,272
It is my business to know that.

265
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,108
He is Sir Charles Phantom,
the notorious Litton.

266
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,777
- The Phantom?
- Yes, one and the same.

267
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,910
His calling card.

268
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,705
Four years ago,
Sir Charles suddenly vanished.

269
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,125
It was rumoured in the underworld...

270
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,252
given up his life of crime,

271
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,672
but my instinct told me
he would not remain in hiding for long.

272
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,632
Four years is not long?

273
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,136
Time is not the issue here,
this glove is the issue here.

274
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,930
It signifies the Phantom
is up to his old tricks.

275
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,684
But I will catch him and root him out.

276
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,645
It won't be easy,
he's a master of disguise.

277
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:10,984
And, undoubtedly, he has gone
back into hiding until the heat is off.

278
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,165
How is he?

279
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,876
Unlovable.

280
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,054
Has he seen it?

281
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,015
No, I thought
you'd like to show it to him.

282
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,178
- How was Paris?
- Expensive.

283
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,181
- Good. Buy anything foolish?
- Lots.

284
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,351
- How have you been?
- Splendid. Fantastic.

285
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,479
I have created something...

286
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,649
absolutely extraordinary
since breakfast.

287
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,651
- Oh, can I see?
- No, no, no. Not yet.

288
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,611
Come on. Please don't be so...

289
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,322
- The impact might be too strong.
- Let me see.

290
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,533
There you go.

291
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,788
- How about that?
- Hmm.

292
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,957
- You know what?
- What?

293
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,793
I think I came back just in time.

294
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,520
Damn!

295
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,606
- What, darling?
- Listen to this:

296
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:59,193
"Police today were conducting
a house-to-house search of Lugash

297
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,822
for the thief,
who Monday night stole the fabled

298
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,783
Pink Panther Diamond
from the Royal Museum here.

299
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,535
According to authorities,

300
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:12,290
the only clue was a white monogrammed
man's glove with the initial "P".

301
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,209
Well, what do you think?

302
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,756
That you didn’t just spend your time
just painting during my absence.

303
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,967
Oh. You think I had something
to do with the robbery.

304
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,344
Didn't you?

305
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,637
You little beast.

306
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,641
Three, no four years ago
I swore to you that I was retiring.

307
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,852
I've been faithful to you ever since.

308
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,440
- In your fashion.
- Now, what the hell does that mean?

309
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,817
That you're being teased.

310
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,071
I believe you, darling.
But you must admit it does sound

311
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,990
like the kind of job only
the Phantom could have done.

312
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,743
I mean, the Pink Panther.

313
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,913
No clues except your
well-known calling card.

314
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,750
Yes. I must admit, the impostor,

315
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,001
very clever.

316
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,128
Very clever, indeed.

317
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:03,674
I'm surprised half the police force
of France hasn't descended on us by now.

318
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,010
But, of course, they will!

319
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,596
- Without a doubt.
- But if you're innocent...

320
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,431
I'm not only innocent,

321
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,601
I'm smart enough that
if I decided to get back in business,

322
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,645
I wouldn't leave my calling card.

323
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,313
Will the police think that?

324
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,024
No.

325
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,818
But you can convince them.

326
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,863
Not unless the real thief was caught.

327
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,658
But then you are lost.

328
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,369
If the police think
that you are the real thief,

329
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:36,666
- then who will catch the impostor?
- Hm?

330
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:43,131
Well, I can only think
of one person really, can't you?

331
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,591
Charles.

332
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,762
Since the alternative is prison,
I don't have very much choice, do I?

333
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,722
I'm frightened.

334
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,392
This impostor is obviously very clever.

335
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,853
He could be dangerous.

336
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,063
Oh, darling.

337
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,483
Not to worry! Trust me.

338
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,734
I may be a bit rusty,

339
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,571
but I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

340
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,730
I congratulate you, chief,
on your excellent facilities.

341
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,941
Of course,
you understand that my visit here

342
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,402
must be of the utmost secrecy.

343
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,156
Of course. My department will do
everything possible to assist you.

344
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:55,620
However, there is one question
that only you can answer.

345
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,623
<i>Oui?</i>

346
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:05,671
Does Sir Charles Litton
have a swimming pool?

347
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,507
A swimming pool?

348
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,515
- Back before you know it.
- Take care.

349
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,537
Now, what identity
will you travel under?

350
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,248
Well, I shall be...

351
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,377
dreary old Sir Charles Litton
leaving the country.

352
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,545
And...

353
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,798
fearless...

354
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:53,969
dashing young doctor
Marvin Tanny arriving in Lugash.

355
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,181
Watch it!

356
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,816
I have the report here.

357
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,485
Someone has trifled with your brakes.

358
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,737
The underworld will stop at nothing.

359
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,739
It's the second attempt on my life.

360
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,118
I may have caught my death of pneumon...

361
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,128
Gesundheit.

362
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:04,284
I have fixed your doorbell
from the ringing.

363
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,537
There is no charge.

364
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,456
Thank you. What do you want?

365
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,750
I am from the telephone company,

366
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,461
there is something
the matter with your pheun.

367
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,630
- My "pheun"?
- What?

368
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,800
You said there's something
the matter with my "pheun".

369
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,219
- Yes.
- My phone?

370
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,930
That is correct,
yes, that is what I been saying.

371
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,266
No trouble with the telephones here.

372
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,853
I know when there is a trouble,
and when there is not a trouble.

373
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,106
And I can definitely tell you
that there is a trouble,

374
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,984
- you may rest assured of that.
- Since when?

375
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,445
Since it was reported.

376
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,573
I see. What is the trouble
with the telephones?

377
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,825
If I knew that,
I could simply call you up

378
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,743
and tell you what the trouble is.

379
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,912
What's the trouble?

380
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,332
This man says we have
trouble with our telephones.

381
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,003
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Emile Flournoy,

382
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,839
communications expert
and chief trouble-shooter

383
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,634
- for the Nice Telephone Company.
- Please come in, monsieur.

384
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,111
Now what can we do to help you?

385
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,656
Which is your nearest phone?

386
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,701
- There.
- What?

387
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,745
Ah, yes...

388
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,081
Hmm.

389
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,627
Yes, this phone will not do at all.

390
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,588
Show me another phone.
It won't do at all, I'm afraid.

391
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:42,799
- Show Monsieur Flour...
- Flournoy!

392
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:47,012
Flournoy... the telephone
in Sir Charles's study.

393
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,684
I hope you locate the trouble, monsieur.

394
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,562
Madame, it is my business
to locate trouble.

395
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,237
- No trouble back there.
- If you require anything...

396
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,030
Monsieur, all I require...

397
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:09,868
is a phone, my little bag of tools
and some privacy in which to work.

398
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,162
That is all I require.

399
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,217
Take that phone,
but don't pick it up until I tell you.

400
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:08,278
- <i>Raymond?</i>
- <i>Si.</i>

401
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,826
<i>I'm taking the 5.00 plane
to Switzerland, have you got that?</i>

402
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,245
<i>Si, Switzerland.</i>

403
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,539
Have you got the merchandise?

404
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,125
- <i>Si.</i>
- Good.

405
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:27,714
I'll see you tomorrow
at the Palace Hotel in Gstaad.

406
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,174
Si.

407
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:33,345
- Goodbye.
- Si. Goodbye.

408
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,572
Inspector?

409
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:53,823
Do not come in!

410
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,075
Do not come in,

411
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,453
I am making further
delicate adjustments to the phone.

412
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,623
I will tell you
when it is safe to enter.

413
00:50:08,421 --> 00:50:11,716
These adjustments must
not be interfered with, you know.

414
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:41,955
Do not come in,
I am just putting my tools away.

415
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:10,942
As I surmised, a slight malfunction
with your phone which I repaired.

416
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:18,408
Well, I must now return to
my office and report my adjustments.

417
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,030
According to the authorities in Nice,

418
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,200
he has so far demolished
one swimming pool and two trucks.

419
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,452
And he's on his way to Gstaad.

420
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,829
- Gstaad?
- Yes.

421
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:09,834
Today, a paradise in the Swiss Alps,
tomorrow, a wasteland.

422
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:13,838
Compared to Clouseau,

423
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:17,550
Attila the Hun
was a Red Cross volunteer.

424
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,807
- Careful!
- Huh?

425
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,435
I put the real one in the bottom drawer.

426
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,562
See?

427
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,466
Oh! Ooh!

428
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,119
Follow that car!

429
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,101
Good day.

430
00:53:51,894 --> 00:53:54,147
- So nice to have you back again.
- Thank you.

431
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,862
Excuse me, do you know
the way to the Palace Hotel?

432
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,155
Yes.

433
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,643
- Bags, sir?
- No, thank you.

434
00:54:33,686 --> 00:54:35,730
This bag never leaves my arm.

435
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,659
Your bag, sir.

436
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,496
Thank you.

437
00:55:35,748 --> 00:55:38,459
<i>Scusi, signor.</i> May I take your coat?

438
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:41,379
Thank you very much.

439
00:55:43,756 --> 00:55:46,259
- Your gloves?
- Of course.

440
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,471
Your hat?

441
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,516
<i>- Grazie, signor.</i>
<i>- Prego.</i>

442
00:56:16,205 --> 00:56:18,124
<i>Oui, Monsieur?</i>

443
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,876
- Do you have a reum?
- A "reum"?

444
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,046
- What?
- You said, do I have a "reum"?

445
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,382
I know perfectly well what I said.

446
00:56:26,632 --> 00:56:28,050
I said, "Do you have a reum?"

447
00:56:29,468 --> 00:56:31,387
You mean, "Do I have a room?"

448
00:56:31,637 --> 00:56:33,681
That is what
I have been saying, you fool.

449
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,309
Do you have a reservation?

450
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,358
I am Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté...

451
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,237
and I am here
on official police business.

452
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,324
Whether you're here on
official police business or not,

453
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,785
this is the height of the season
and the hotel is full!

454
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,746
Listen, my friend.

455
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,248
This is a matter of national importance,

456
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:02,418
and if you continue
to be difficult with me

457
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:06,047
I shall have no alternative
but to have speaks with my superiors.

458
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,175
Well...

459
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,427
In that case, monsieur...

460
00:57:12,928 --> 00:57:15,348
we do have a room.

461
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,392
I thought as much.

462
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:33,240
<i>Lugash Airways announce the arrival
of flight 12 from Paris and Nice.</i>

463
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:37,703
<i>Passengers wishing to travel
to the city terminal by bus</i>

464
00:57:37,953 --> 00:57:40,623
<i>should proceed to the Lugash
transport counter.</i>

465
00:57:40,873 --> 00:57:43,459
The nature of your visit
to Lugash, Dr Tanny?

466
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:46,545
- Is it business or pleasure?
- Purely pleasure.

467
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,215
Next.

468
00:57:56,138 --> 00:58:01,102
<i>Incoming passengers are reminded
they should retain the white card.</i>

469
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:05,856
<i>This must be surrendered
to Lugash authorities before departure.</i>

470
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:10,236
<i>The loss of this card
may cause considerable delays.</i>

471
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:18,869
Have my bags sent up to my room.

472
00:58:29,421 --> 00:58:30,714
How are you, Pepi?

473
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,594
What a surprise!
It's Sir Charles Litton, isn't it?

474
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,763
Not necessarily.

475
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,224
<i>Un Cognac, s'il vous plaît.</i>

476
00:58:40,432 --> 00:58:41,725
Well...

477
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,104
Where do I find the Fat Man?

478
00:58:45,354 --> 00:58:47,273
I've... I have not...

479
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:49,483
I've not seen the Fat Man in years.

480
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,068
Really?

481
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:58,742
You're not working for the Fat Man,
then who are you working for?

482
00:58:59,785 --> 00:59:01,662
You are breaking my finger.

483
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:04,331
Why don't you call a policeman?

484
00:59:05,874 --> 00:59:06,959
All right, all right.

485
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:09,420
You can find the Fat Man
at the Salamander.

486
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:12,548
Thank you, Pepi.

487
00:59:13,632 --> 00:59:18,345
Why don't you order yourself
some liniment... on the rocks?

488
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:34,338
Well, Charles!

489
01:00:34,546 --> 01:00:36,965
Well, my old friend.

490
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,635
It's good to see you.

491
01:00:40,135 --> 01:00:41,637
Come, sit down.

492
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:44,973
I really miss seeing you.
You look wonderful.

493
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,850
What can I do for you?

494
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:50,437
Well...
I need a favour from you, old man.

495
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:51,730
Of course.

496
01:00:51,897 --> 01:00:54,024
But first, I need your help.

497
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:58,487
And my two associates,
they're here to guard the Pink Panther.

498
01:00:58,737 --> 01:01:00,447
When you've finished your drink,

499
01:01:00,656 --> 01:01:02,866
- you'll hand it over.
- I haven't got it.

500
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:05,661
But you took it.

501
01:01:06,161 --> 01:01:09,039
I wish I had, truly.
But I didn't, I swear it.

502
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,959
Normally, Charles,
I'm a man who detests violence,

503
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:15,796
but in your case I'm forced to make
a most regrettable exception.

504
01:01:16,004 --> 01:01:18,173
Would it upset you too much
to explain why?

505
01:01:18,423 --> 01:01:21,009
Under the pretence
of trying to catch the thief,

506
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,762
the general is hurting
many innocent people...

507
01:01:24,513 --> 01:01:26,598
and a group of my very good friends.

508
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,643
If I give him the thief,
he'll have to stop hurting them.

509
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:33,021
Of course,
if you didn't steal the Panther,

510
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,357
one might almost conclude the general,

511
01:01:35,607 --> 01:01:37,860
in order to get rid of
his political enemies,

512
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:40,404
engineered the robbery himself.

513
01:01:40,612 --> 01:01:42,781
I bet he even offered a reward.

514
01:01:43,031 --> 01:01:46,326
- A very considerable reward, dead...
- Or alive?

515
01:01:46,535 --> 01:01:47,995
And if you are dead...

516
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:51,373
I can't prove
I didn't steal the Pink Panther.

517
01:01:51,623 --> 01:01:53,250
I knew you would figure it out.

518
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:56,503
Deliver the body to the general
with my compliments.

519
01:01:57,045 --> 01:02:00,424
I'm awfully sorry... old boy.

520
01:02:02,634 --> 01:02:04,261
Well, you know the old saying,

521
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:06,013
"With friends like you,

522
01:02:06,221 --> 01:02:07,931
- who needs enemies?"
- Enemies.

523
01:03:39,564 --> 01:03:41,400
Good evening, Dr Tanny.

524
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:42,984
Good evening.

525
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:45,362
I am Colonel Sharki.

526
01:03:46,655 --> 01:03:50,283
Yes! I thought we might be
running into one another...

527
01:03:50,742 --> 01:03:52,452
sooner or later.

528
01:03:53,495 --> 01:03:57,457
I... I need your help.

529
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,169
Now, Colonel Sharki...

530
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,798
What could a simple doctor do

531
01:04:05,006 --> 01:04:08,176
to help the head
of the Lugash secret police?

532
01:04:08,426 --> 01:04:10,554
A simple doctor? Nothing.

533
01:04:10,762 --> 01:04:13,807
But the notorious Phantom?

534
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:16,852
Oh, he could do quite a bit.

535
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:18,436
For instance?

536
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:23,817
<i>I want your cooperation
in recovering the Pink Panther.</i>

537
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:27,404
The Fat Man seems to think
that you cooked up this robbery

538
01:04:27,612 --> 01:04:31,449
as an excuse to do
a little political housecleaning.

539
01:04:33,785 --> 01:04:37,289
The Fat Man is not
the only one with that opinion.

540
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:40,834
And if you can prove
that you are not guilty...

541
01:04:41,042 --> 01:04:43,962
- You have a bad leg?
- Oh, it's nothing.

542
01:04:44,212 --> 01:04:47,257
If you can prove you're not guilty,
I'm in serious trouble.

543
01:04:47,966 --> 01:04:51,011
Because of the religious significance
of the Pink Panther,

544
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:53,013
it's imperative to the government

545
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,682
that sooner or later
the thief be apprehended,

546
01:04:55,891 --> 01:04:59,477
- and the jewel returned.
- You would prefer it later than sooner?

547
01:05:01,146 --> 01:05:03,023
I can't tell you how reassuring it is

548
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,775
to know that we
understand each other so well.

549
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:07,903
And if...

550
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:09,988
I do...

551
01:05:10,906 --> 01:05:12,699
catch the thief?

552
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:16,578
I have every confidence that you will.

553
01:05:16,745 --> 01:05:18,747
How does the saying go?

554
01:05:20,415 --> 01:05:24,127
"Set a thief to catch a thief."

555
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:27,923
Goodnight, Dr Tanny.

556
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:10,131
- You hate him.
- Yes, I hate him all right.

557
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:12,676
- How much do you hate him?
- How much?

558
01:06:12,884 --> 01:06:14,302
How high is up?

559
01:06:14,552 --> 01:06:17,013
I hate every little
molecule in his body.

560
01:06:17,222 --> 01:06:18,390
You'd like to kill him?

561
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,394
To kill him. Oh, God, yes. To kill him.

562
01:06:23,228 --> 01:06:24,646
Why don't you?

563
01:06:24,896 --> 01:06:26,731
Oh, to kill him.

564
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:29,359
What? Why don't I?

565
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:32,487
- It's not so easy, you try.
- I mean kill him psychically.

566
01:06:32,737 --> 01:06:33,988
- Ridiculous.
- Why?

567
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:36,533
Nothing I can do psychically would have

568
01:06:36,741 --> 01:06:38,952
- the slightest effect on him.
- Why not?

569
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,329
Because he's got the brain of a minkey.

570
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:43,790
- Minkey?
- What?

571
01:06:43,998 --> 01:06:48,128
- You said minkey.
- I did?

572
01:06:48,336 --> 01:06:50,380
You see, I'm beginning to talk like him.

573
01:06:50,588 --> 01:06:53,550
Now doctor, you'd better come up
with a better suggestion

574
01:06:53,758 --> 01:06:55,677
or I'll get myself another analyst.

575
01:06:55,927 --> 01:06:57,846
Now, just relax.

576
01:06:58,096 --> 01:07:00,140
Relax.

577
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:02,642
I haven't slept for a week.

578
01:07:03,351 --> 01:07:07,772
I just lie there thinking the same
thoughts over and over and over again.

579
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:12,652
Describe your thoughts. Get them out
in the open and you'll feel much better.

580
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:14,446
All right.

581
01:07:14,696 --> 01:07:16,156
See, it's always the same.

582
01:07:16,364 --> 01:07:18,158
Clouseau is sitting there,

583
01:07:18,366 --> 01:07:21,327
in a chair just like you,
with his back to me.

584
01:07:22,287 --> 01:07:23,913
And then suddenly,

585
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:28,460
my hands go round his throat
and I begin to squeeze.

586
01:07:29,544 --> 01:07:33,506
It's wonderful, it's marvellous.
I'm squeezing.

587
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:37,552
And the more I squeeze,
the freer I feel.

588
01:07:37,802 --> 01:07:41,472
I'm in ecstasy.

589
01:07:41,723 --> 01:07:43,850
And then suddenly...

590
01:07:44,058 --> 01:07:47,270
Suddenly, my problem is solved.

591
01:07:48,646 --> 01:07:49,856
Doctor?

592
01:07:50,064 --> 01:07:51,232
Doctor!

593
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:54,903
Sir Charles arrived
at my office this morning at ten,

594
01:07:55,153 --> 01:07:57,238
and we reviewed
all the evidence to date.

595
01:07:57,488 --> 01:08:00,283
He was interested,
asked all the right questions.

596
01:08:00,825 --> 01:08:02,452
Then we went to the viewing room

597
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:05,622
and watched the film
from the hidden monitoring cameras.

598
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:09,500
This was the last group to go through
the museum before it was robbed.

599
01:08:10,084 --> 01:08:12,879
- Do you recognise any of these people?
- No.

600
01:08:13,087 --> 01:08:14,172
No.

601
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:16,633
He appeared to
study the film very carefully,

602
01:08:16,841 --> 01:08:19,552
and he claimed not
to recognise any one of them.

603
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:20,845
No.

604
01:08:21,012 --> 01:08:23,222
We questioned him three times
about each.

605
01:08:23,431 --> 01:08:24,515
No.

606
01:08:24,682 --> 01:08:26,601
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

607
01:08:27,352 --> 01:08:29,228
- This one?
- No.

608
01:08:29,437 --> 01:08:32,649
- How about that one?
- No!

609
01:08:33,024 --> 01:08:35,151
Each time the results were identical.

610
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,321
Little or no stress until
questioned about number three.

611
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:39,697
Then, hard stress.

612
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:41,240
Number three.

613
01:08:41,449 --> 01:08:44,035
A young man,
the museum guide remembers him.

614
01:09:12,397 --> 01:09:13,940
Good morning.

615
01:09:14,565 --> 01:09:16,234
It could be better.

616
01:09:16,651 --> 01:09:19,654
- How?
- You could go away.

617
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:22,699
All right,
but first I'll need your truck.

618
01:09:22,907 --> 01:09:25,034
I haven't got a truck anymore.

619
01:09:26,828 --> 01:09:28,788
I sold it.

620
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:32,291
What do you want it for?

621
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,919
You're gonna help me
get across the border.

622
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:39,382
It's impossible, the border is closed.

623
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,259
You have to have a special pass.

624
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:44,470
- Then get one.
- It's out of the question.

625
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:47,515
If I go to the Fat Man
to buy a special pass,

626
01:09:47,765 --> 01:09:50,184
he wants to know the reason.

627
01:09:50,435 --> 01:09:52,729
Then tell him
that I've threatened your life

628
01:09:52,937 --> 01:09:55,189
unless you help me
to get across the border.

629
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,109
Tell him that for
half the sum of the reward

630
01:09:58,276 --> 01:10:01,279
plus a forged pass
to get you out of the country,

631
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:05,116
you will deliver me into an ambush
at some pre-named place

632
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:08,703
of the Fat Man's choosing,
this side of the border.

633
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:11,622
What if he doesn't believe me?

634
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,041
I'm sure you'll be able to convince him.

635
01:10:15,293 --> 01:10:19,130
And if, my dear Pepi,
you double-cross me,

636
01:10:19,797 --> 01:10:23,426
it'll be a very long while before
you give your next piano recital.

637
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:41,319
Yes?

638
01:10:41,486 --> 01:10:44,530
You asked to be kept informed
of Lady Litton's activities.

639
01:10:44,739 --> 01:10:46,949
- Yes.
- She's going skiing at two.

640
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:50,495
- Skiing in this weather?
- On the glacier.

641
01:10:50,745 --> 01:10:52,205
On the glacier?

642
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:57,376
- How long have you been a bellboy?
- Oh! Too long, monsieur.

643
01:10:57,585 --> 01:11:00,129
Keep up this good work
and very soon I will see to it

644
01:11:00,338 --> 01:11:03,007
that you become a bell man.

645
01:11:15,144 --> 01:11:17,396
- <i>Bonjour,</i> milady.
- Hello, good afternoon.

646
01:11:17,605 --> 01:11:21,400
I changed my mind about skiing. I'm
going to the tennis matches instead.

647
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:24,820
If my husband calls
tell him I'll be back around four.

648
01:11:25,071 --> 01:11:26,822
- <i>Oui, madame.</i>
- Thank you.

649
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:38,626
Hello?

650
01:11:38,876 --> 01:11:41,087
<i>Guten Tag?</i>

651
01:12:11,534 --> 01:12:15,329
- Hello? <i>Wie geht's?</i>
- <i>Wie geht's?</i>

652
01:15:24,184 --> 01:15:28,689
Swine bird, that is my private
moustache. You naughty bird.

653
01:15:33,402 --> 01:15:34,653
Swine!

654
01:19:02,152 --> 01:19:03,195
No, no, no, wait!

655
01:19:03,361 --> 01:19:05,614
It's me,
Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté.

656
01:19:05,822 --> 01:19:06,990
- She's coming.
- What?

657
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:08,408
In the elevator.

658
01:19:41,441 --> 01:19:42,651
Hello.

659
01:20:46,256 --> 01:20:48,800
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

660
01:20:49,092 --> 01:20:50,844
What we are doing...

661
01:20:56,891 --> 01:20:58,476
She's coming!

662
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:06,484
I'm sorry.

663
01:21:10,655 --> 01:21:12,365
Oh, come in, please.

664
01:21:15,618 --> 01:21:19,622
- Some towels you have, <i>bitte?</i>
- Oh, yes. I'll go get them.

665
01:22:42,163 --> 01:22:48,086
- What are you doing?
- <i>Nichts. Staubsucker.</i>

666
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,009
Out! <i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>

667
01:23:22,871 --> 01:23:24,289
Get up, you fool!

668
01:23:25,582 --> 01:23:28,418
<i>Guten Tag! Wie geht's?</i>

669
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:49,939
What took you so long?

670
01:23:50,148 --> 01:23:53,067
The Fat Man is not convinced so easily.

671
01:23:53,276 --> 01:23:56,529
- But you managed.
- Here is the pass.

672
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:00,575
And you gave him...

673
01:24:01,242 --> 01:24:02,744
As you suggested.

674
01:24:02,952 --> 01:24:06,873
For the pass and half of the reward,
I will hand you over.

675
01:24:07,081 --> 01:24:09,792
- Quickly, we must hurry.
- Where?

676
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:13,046
- What?
- Where did you agree to hand me over?

677
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:15,298
The Fat Man will be waiting at the point

678
01:24:15,506 --> 01:24:19,010
one mile south of the roadway,
seven miles from the border.

679
01:24:19,218 --> 01:24:21,721
I know the place precisely.

680
01:24:21,929 --> 01:24:25,058
I will avoid it absolutely.
Quick, we must hurry!

681
01:24:27,518 --> 01:24:28,561
No, after you.

682
01:24:29,187 --> 01:24:30,688
- What?
- Try "why."

683
01:24:30,897 --> 01:24:33,232
- Why?
- Shh!

684
01:24:33,441 --> 01:24:37,362
Because I know you precisely,
and doubt you absolutely.

685
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:40,281
Sir Charles... Please, please!
Sir Charles...

686
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:44,577
Don't worry, as long as you've told the
truth, there's nothing to worry about.

687
01:24:44,786 --> 01:24:46,913
Nothing to worry about.

688
01:24:47,121 --> 01:24:48,331
All right?

689
01:24:48,539 --> 01:24:51,209
- Be careful.
- Thank you very much.

690
01:26:46,449 --> 01:26:48,409
Open it.

691
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,080
Be careful.

692
01:26:57,543 --> 01:26:59,503
He tricked me!

693
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:40,002
From the gentleman at the bar, madam.

694
01:28:18,207 --> 01:28:19,834
Good evening.

695
01:28:20,543 --> 01:28:22,503
Good evening.

696
01:28:23,504 --> 01:28:26,966
Monsieur Guy Gadbois, at your service.

697
01:28:27,925 --> 01:28:30,636
- How do you do? I'm Lady Litton.
- Yes, I know.

698
01:28:30,845 --> 01:28:33,597
- Oh.
- I took the liberty of finding out.

699
01:28:33,806 --> 01:28:35,266
I hope you are not offended.

700
01:28:35,474 --> 01:28:37,810
That depends on your intentions.

701
01:28:38,018 --> 01:28:40,521
Strictly honourable, I can assure you.

702
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:43,065
A man sees a beautiful chicken,

703
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:46,068
he can't help but be inquisitive,
you know?

704
01:28:47,736 --> 01:28:50,906
Would you think it naughty of me
if I offered to buy you a drink?

705
01:28:51,115 --> 01:28:52,575
But you already have.

706
01:28:56,996 --> 01:29:00,291
How about I buy myself one,
and we'll drink it together?

707
01:29:00,499 --> 01:29:02,209
All right.

708
01:29:04,795 --> 01:29:05,963
Waiter...

709
01:29:06,172 --> 01:29:09,383
another Kahlúa and ginger ale, please.

710
01:29:12,303 --> 01:29:13,721
Well...

711
01:29:14,513 --> 01:29:19,101
If there is a Lady Litton,
there must be a lord.

712
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:21,353
- What?
- Lord Litton.

713
01:29:22,563 --> 01:29:24,523
- Yes, he's in...
- Yes?

714
01:29:25,191 --> 01:29:27,902
- ...plastics.
- Oh, the plastic.

715
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,154
- In...
- Yes?

716
01:29:30,362 --> 01:29:32,698
Industrial plastics.

717
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:35,618
Very interesting.

718
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:45,336
Well...

719
01:29:46,629 --> 01:29:50,090
Here is looking at you, kid.

720
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,820
You have anything to declare?

721
01:30:12,029 --> 01:30:13,948
Nothing.

722
01:30:14,156 --> 01:30:16,116
You may proceed.

723
01:30:33,425 --> 01:30:35,135
I come here very often, you know.

724
01:30:35,302 --> 01:30:37,304
I come here for the winter sports,

725
01:30:37,513 --> 01:30:39,473
- for the skiing.
- So do I.

726
01:30:39,682 --> 01:30:41,475
Why have we never met?

727
01:30:41,684 --> 01:30:43,644
Well, it's quite simple, really.

728
01:30:43,852 --> 01:30:47,147
I get up at the crack of dawn...
I'm so terribly sorry about that.

729
01:30:47,356 --> 01:30:49,650
I get up at the crack of dawn, always.

730
01:30:49,858 --> 01:30:52,486
Up the mountain,
down the slopes on the piste.

731
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:54,655
You must be a very good skier.

732
01:30:55,155 --> 01:30:59,118
Well, I started when I was
a mere babe in arms.

733
01:30:59,326 --> 01:31:01,995
I could ski before I could even crawl.

734
01:31:04,164 --> 01:31:07,209
I'm terribly sorry, I beg your pardon.

735
01:31:07,418 --> 01:31:08,919
It's all right.

736
01:31:09,128 --> 01:31:12,047
This hotel is deteriorating rapidly.

737
01:31:12,923 --> 01:31:14,049
Well...

738
01:31:14,258 --> 01:31:16,760
Here's to you, Monsieur Gadbois.

739
01:31:20,431 --> 01:31:22,266
Is that your own parrot?

740
01:31:22,474 --> 01:31:25,060
- No, it comes with the hotel.
- Does it?

741
01:31:25,519 --> 01:31:28,355
Someone let it out of its cage,
and I can't get it back in.

742
01:31:29,189 --> 01:31:32,276
- You need another glass.
- I most certainly do.

743
01:31:33,193 --> 01:31:35,154
Swine parrot.

744
01:31:35,362 --> 01:31:37,698
What is it you do, Monsieur Gadbois?

745
01:31:38,782 --> 01:31:42,578
Well, you know, I do a little bit
of this and a little bit of that.

746
01:31:42,786 --> 01:31:44,913
A man of mystery.

747
01:31:45,122 --> 01:31:46,790
One might say that, yes.

748
01:31:46,999 --> 01:31:48,750
I would, of course, tell you more.

749
01:31:48,959 --> 01:31:51,920
But it would be
safer for you if I did not.

750
01:31:53,922 --> 01:31:56,216
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.

751
01:31:56,425 --> 01:31:58,302
Yes?

752
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,223
Excuse me, for moment
I thought I was in your apartment.

753
01:32:05,058 --> 01:32:07,394
- Hello?
- I am in your apartment.

754
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:10,314
- It's for you.
- For me?

755
01:32:15,819 --> 01:32:18,989
There is no need to leave on my account.

756
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:21,533
There is need to leave on my account.

757
01:32:25,162 --> 01:32:29,208
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Monsieur Gadbois?

758
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:32,836
Yes, this is Monsieur Gadbois.
Who is that speaking?

759
01:32:33,545 --> 01:32:36,381
Don't you know? Can't you guess?

760
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:39,468
I'll give you a clue.
This is the man who hates you.

761
01:32:39,676 --> 01:32:41,845
This is the man who
more than anything else

762
01:32:42,054 --> 01:32:43,972
would like to see you dead and buried.

763
01:32:44,181 --> 01:32:48,060
The headwaiter that works at the
little bistro on the rue des Beaux-Arts?

764
01:32:48,268 --> 01:32:50,896
No! This is Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

765
01:32:51,104 --> 01:32:52,356
<i>Idiot!</i>

766
01:32:53,231 --> 01:32:55,984
You understand that
anyone could call up here

767
01:32:56,193 --> 01:32:57,945
and ask for Monsieur Guy Gadbois

768
01:32:58,153 --> 01:33:00,697
and say that they were
Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

769
01:33:00,906 --> 01:33:02,658
What is your code name?

770
01:33:02,866 --> 01:33:04,201
Code name, huh?

771
01:33:04,409 --> 01:33:05,744
Code name?

772
01:33:06,161 --> 01:33:08,163
<i>I don't have a code name.</i>

773
01:33:08,372 --> 01:33:10,791
<i>I never had a code name, lunatic!</i>

774
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:14,252
I understand that, sir,
but only the real Inspector Dreyfus

775
01:33:14,461 --> 01:33:16,838
would know that
he did not have a code name.

776
01:33:17,965 --> 01:33:21,093
Clouseau,
why are you still in Switzerland?

777
01:33:23,387 --> 01:33:27,057
Because I am here attempting
to interrogate Lady Litton

778
01:33:27,265 --> 01:33:30,394
and trying to find out
where her husband is.

779
01:33:30,894 --> 01:33:32,270
Her husband is in Lugash.

780
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:34,231
He's been there since Tuesday.

781
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:37,526
Well, in that case, I will leave
on the next available plane.

782
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:41,446
Yes, sir, yes. Quite, quite.

783
01:33:41,655 --> 01:33:45,534
I quite understand what you mean,
and I'm not arguing with you about that.

784
01:33:45,742 --> 01:33:48,370
That would be my advice, as well.
Yes, absolutely.

785
01:33:48,578 --> 01:33:49,913
But...

786
01:33:51,164 --> 01:33:55,085
Yes, I can understand your feelings
under the circumstances. Absolutely.

787
01:33:55,293 --> 01:33:57,003
Yes, that is quite right.

788
01:33:57,212 --> 01:34:00,340
But I must say to you, sir,
whatever your feelings are,

789
01:34:00,549 --> 01:34:04,177
you must not call me here
at any hour of the night or day.

790
01:34:04,386 --> 01:34:06,388
Even in an emergency.

791
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:09,808
A little bit of this
and a little bit of that

792
01:34:10,016 --> 01:34:11,268
add up sometimes.

793
01:34:11,476 --> 01:34:12,519
Thank you.

794
01:34:12,686 --> 01:34:15,856
Did I understand you to say
you were leaving on the next plane?

795
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,357
Regrettably, yes, yes.

796
01:34:17,566 --> 01:34:19,735
One of life's little tragedies,
you know.

797
01:34:19,943 --> 01:34:23,196
- Aw!
- So until we meet again...

798
01:34:24,781 --> 01:34:26,158
I will say...

799
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:29,161
here is looking at you, kid.

800
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:37,419
Is anything the matter?

801
01:34:38,378 --> 01:34:40,213
Yeah.

802
01:34:40,422 --> 01:34:42,174
Strange taste.

803
01:34:42,507 --> 01:34:44,009
Well...

804
01:34:45,218 --> 01:34:47,179
- <i>au revoir.</i>
- <i>Au revoir.</i>

805
01:34:59,566 --> 01:35:01,568
The concierge, please.

806
01:35:57,874 --> 01:36:00,252
Monsieur Gadbois' room.

807
01:36:32,826 --> 01:36:34,202
Oh, no.

808
01:37:33,052 --> 01:37:34,095
Yes?

809
01:37:34,262 --> 01:37:35,930
Clouseau.

810
01:37:36,139 --> 01:37:40,101
Since you have seen fit to disregard
my orders and remain in Switzerland...

811
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:41,352
<i>Don't interrupt!</i>

812
01:37:41,519 --> 01:37:43,772
I want you to arrest Lady Litton!

813
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,815
Arrest the Lady Litton?

814
01:37:46,024 --> 01:37:47,484
Immediately!

815
01:37:47,692 --> 01:37:50,236
If she is not in your custody
within five minutes,

816
01:37:50,445 --> 01:37:53,531
you'll be checking
parking meters in Martinique.

817
01:37:54,657 --> 01:37:56,618
Yes, sir.

818
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,456
Five minutes!

819
01:38:04,125 --> 01:38:06,794
No, Cato, you fool,
this is not the time.

820
01:38:07,003 --> 01:38:09,672
This is not the time, Cato!

821
01:38:10,924 --> 01:38:13,092
Come out of there, come out of there!

822
01:38:13,301 --> 01:38:15,261
This is the time!

823
01:38:16,638 --> 01:38:18,598
You stupid fool, you see what you did?

824
01:38:18,806 --> 01:38:21,351
You forgot the first rule
of self-defence.

825
01:38:21,559 --> 01:38:23,394
Never be taken by surprise!

826
01:38:23,603 --> 01:38:26,648
I didn't expect to see you
out of hospital so soon.

827
01:38:26,856 --> 01:38:28,858
My brown suit. Give me the valet.

828
01:38:29,067 --> 01:38:32,237
They did an excellent job
of restoration on your yellow skin.

829
01:38:32,445 --> 01:38:36,616
Valet, this is Inspector Clouseau.
Please send up my brown...

830
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:40,411
Well, please send down
my brown suit immediately.

831
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,830
I cannot wait.
As quick as you possibly can!

832
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:44,332
Quicker, please!

833
01:38:45,166 --> 01:38:47,835
I can't wait for them.
Help me get dressed.

834
01:38:48,586 --> 01:38:50,505
I have to go and arrest Lady Litton.

835
01:38:50,713 --> 01:38:53,258
Arrest Lady Litton, be sure,
but on what charge?

836
01:38:53,466 --> 01:38:54,509
Hello, hello!

837
01:38:54,676 --> 01:38:58,137
This is Inspector Clouseau.
Please connect me with Paris, France.

838
01:38:58,346 --> 01:38:59,847
Trocadero-3-7-1...

839
01:39:04,727 --> 01:39:05,812
Hello, <i>oui.</i>

840
01:39:06,312 --> 01:39:07,480
What?

841
01:39:07,689 --> 01:39:08,940
Who?

842
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:12,777
Yes, yes, OK. I'll accept it.

843
01:39:15,488 --> 01:39:16,698
Hello, Clouseau.

844
01:39:16,906 --> 01:39:18,825
No, he's not here.

845
01:39:19,033 --> 01:39:21,202
On vacation.
He won't be back for a week.

846
01:39:21,411 --> 01:39:22,495
I just spoke with him.

847
01:39:22,704 --> 01:39:25,415
He instructed me to arrest
Lady Litton immediately.

848
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:26,833
What?

849
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:28,334
Yes!

850
01:39:28,543 --> 01:39:30,586
That's very easy for you to say.

851
01:39:30,795 --> 01:39:33,256
I would be delighted to arrest her, yes!

852
01:39:33,464 --> 01:39:34,507
On what charge?

853
01:39:34,716 --> 01:39:37,176
It could be embarrassing
if I go to her and say,

854
01:39:37,385 --> 01:39:39,303
"I arrest you in the name of the law."

855
01:39:39,512 --> 01:39:42,098
She says "On what charge?"
I do not have the answer.

856
01:39:42,306 --> 01:39:43,349
What?

857
01:39:43,558 --> 01:39:44,934
Oh, yes!

858
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:47,520
And the same to you!

859
01:39:47,854 --> 01:39:49,814
Filthy swine.

860
01:39:51,232 --> 01:39:53,151
Cato, very strange.

861
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:55,236
Chief Inspector Dreyfus calls me,

862
01:39:55,445 --> 01:39:59,615
tells me to arrest Lady Litton,
immediately, without a charge

863
01:39:59,824 --> 01:40:02,118
I call him back,
I find he's not in his office.

864
01:40:02,326 --> 01:40:05,955
Even stranger,
I find he's gone away on vacation.

865
01:40:06,622 --> 01:40:10,668
Cato, things are very fishy in Denmark.

866
01:40:10,877 --> 01:40:13,671
- Switzerland.
- Yes, there too.

867
01:40:22,638 --> 01:40:26,100
No more. No more, I've had enough.

868
01:40:26,309 --> 01:40:29,312
This time it ends
with a bullet in his brain.

869
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,688
Brain.

870
01:40:36,861 --> 01:40:38,988
<i>- Bonjour...</i>
- Shh.

871
01:40:43,201 --> 01:40:45,036
<i>Merci.</i>

872
01:41:12,063 --> 01:41:14,690
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

873
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:16,359
Breakfast.

874
01:41:16,567 --> 01:41:17,693
<i>Voilà.</i>

875
01:41:17,902 --> 01:41:20,988
Just leave it over there.
I'll sign for it later.

876
01:41:27,703 --> 01:41:30,831
How about a little tip?

877
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:34,919
Charles, darling.

878
01:41:36,587 --> 01:41:38,714
All right, all right.

879
01:41:38,923 --> 01:41:40,424
Now where is it?

880
01:41:40,633 --> 01:41:43,553
After all these years, you need to ask?

881
01:41:43,761 --> 01:41:44,887
I'm quite serious.

882
01:41:45,096 --> 01:41:48,849
Oh, I hope so. You hotel waiters
lead such interesting lives.

883
01:41:49,058 --> 01:41:53,354
No, no, no, no, no. Not now, darling.
Not now. Please, now, where is it?

884
01:41:54,105 --> 01:41:56,232
That depends on what you're looking for.

885
01:41:56,440 --> 01:42:00,695
Now, come on, Claudine. Please, not now.
Where is it? I'm losing patience.

886
01:42:00,903 --> 01:42:04,574
I shall ask the hotel
to send up another waiter.

887
01:42:04,782 --> 01:42:09,412
I should like very much if you would
hand me over the Pink Panther,

888
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:12,581
if it is not too much trouble.

889
01:42:15,418 --> 01:42:17,753
How did you find out so quickly?

890
01:42:17,962 --> 01:42:19,630
Feminine intuition.

891
01:42:19,839 --> 01:42:24,927
I thought it would take you
at least another week.

892
01:42:25,136 --> 01:42:28,681
You know, you are
very good at what you do.

893
01:42:28,889 --> 01:42:30,766
Thank you.

894
01:42:30,975 --> 01:42:35,396
I was prepared to surrender my body
to Clouseau if it was necessary.

895
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:38,441
Why did you do it?

896
01:42:38,649 --> 01:42:42,778
I didn't. I said I was prepared to.

897
01:42:42,987 --> 01:42:45,448
Aren't you a little bit proud of me?

898
01:42:45,656 --> 01:42:47,533
You nearly had me killed, you know.

899
01:42:47,742 --> 01:42:52,121
- It's better than dying of boredom.
- Me? Bored with you?

900
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:54,290
I'm sorry, darling.

901
01:42:54,498 --> 01:42:59,795
It's just that I never realised
how tedious life could be

902
01:43:00,004 --> 01:43:03,257
for a retired jewel thief. Yuck.

903
01:43:08,137 --> 01:43:09,972
Clever little beast.

904
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:13,642
Better than a hotel safe.

905
01:43:18,481 --> 01:43:20,775
Now tell me,

906
01:43:20,983 --> 01:43:24,236
how did you find out it was me?

907
01:43:24,445 --> 01:43:29,658
Well, there's something about a wife
even with a beard.

908
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:34,497
Now, come on, darling.

909
01:43:34,705 --> 01:43:38,167
It's time to get dressed,
pack and go home.

910
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,503
Now, come on, darling...

911
01:43:42,171 --> 01:43:46,258
Forgive the intrusion, madam, but you
see before you a very disillusioned man.

912
01:43:46,467 --> 01:43:48,969
Disillusioned and with a gun.

913
01:43:49,178 --> 01:43:51,263
- He's obviously not with the hotel.
- No.

914
01:43:51,472 --> 01:43:55,392
Allow me to introduce Colonel Sharki
of the Lugash Secret Police.

915
01:43:55,601 --> 01:43:57,019
That explains the gun.

916
01:43:57,228 --> 01:44:01,106
I foolishly believed that your husband
was a man of integrity.

917
01:44:01,315 --> 01:44:02,983
- That was foolish.
- Thank you.

918
01:44:03,192 --> 01:44:07,822
You see, your husband and I,
we had an arrangement.

919
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:11,492
He was to do certain things,
and if he didn't...

920
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,662
You were to do certain things.

921
01:44:15,538 --> 01:44:16,789
Regrettably.

922
01:44:16,997 --> 01:44:21,210
Coffee, darling. I'm sorry,
there's only one cup.

923
01:44:21,418 --> 01:44:25,589
I know I'm going
to be sorry I asked this,

924
01:44:25,798 --> 01:44:27,591
but want to give me a for instance?

925
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:30,302
First, you will hand over
the Pink Panther.

926
01:44:30,928 --> 01:44:32,137
And second?

927
01:44:32,346 --> 01:44:34,098
I will be forced to shoot you.

928
01:44:34,306 --> 01:44:35,349
Who's forcing you?

929
01:44:39,687 --> 01:44:42,398
Open the door in the name of the law.

930
01:44:42,606 --> 01:44:45,859
Would you please, sir, answer the door?

931
01:44:46,068 --> 01:44:47,945
Excuse me, darling.

932
01:44:48,153 --> 01:44:52,116
Lady Litton, I am forced to arrest you!

933
01:44:52,324 --> 01:44:54,076
And if you do not open this door,

934
01:44:54,285 --> 01:44:57,246
I will have no alternative
but to break it down.

935
01:44:57,621 --> 01:44:58,998
Very well.

936
01:45:08,007 --> 01:45:10,217
Guy, you're all wet!

937
01:45:10,426 --> 01:45:12,511
There's a defect in my plumbing.

938
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:15,097
Lady Litton, listen to me.

939
01:45:15,889 --> 01:45:18,225
I have deceived you.

940
01:45:18,434 --> 01:45:22,396
I am not Guy Gadbois. I am
Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté,

941
01:45:22,605 --> 01:45:24,940
and it is my painful duty to arrest you.

942
01:45:25,149 --> 01:45:26,358
Do you know my husband?

943
01:45:26,567 --> 01:45:29,069
I must confess I do.
I met him several years ago.

944
01:45:29,278 --> 01:45:31,947
When I meet him again,
I'll arrest him immediately.

945
01:45:32,156 --> 01:45:34,116
Then you must have met Colonel Sharki.

946
01:45:34,325 --> 01:45:38,203
That idiot from the Secret Police.
Yes, I know him. And when I...

947
01:45:39,496 --> 01:45:42,291
Sir Charles Litton,
I arrest you in the name of the law,

948
01:45:42,499 --> 01:45:44,877
and I warn you that
anything you say will be...

949
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:49,882
Before you get all worked up,
there's something you must know.

950
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,426
He intends to kill all of us.

951
01:45:52,634 --> 01:45:54,887
- Who?
- Colonel Sharki.

952
01:45:58,932 --> 01:46:03,270
Good Sharki Colonel God,
we were just talking about you.

953
01:46:03,479 --> 01:46:06,273
As you can see,
I've got the whole case buttoned up.

954
01:46:06,482 --> 01:46:07,816
Everything is sewn up.

955
01:46:08,025 --> 01:46:10,736
This is Sir Charles Phantom,
the famous Pink Litton.

956
01:46:10,944 --> 01:46:12,905
Who stole the...

957
01:46:13,572 --> 01:46:15,616
What did you say?
He was going to kill us?

958
01:46:15,824 --> 01:46:18,452
Well, if you can persuade him
to change his mind...

959
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,871
- You're joking, of course.
- No.

960
01:46:22,706 --> 01:46:26,168
- You're going to kill me, as well?
- With pleasure.

961
01:46:27,336 --> 01:46:30,506
Is there anything I can do that
will make you change your mind?

962
01:46:30,714 --> 01:46:34,009
Well, there's nothing
that I can think of.

963
01:46:34,968 --> 01:46:37,346
Supposing that I thought of something.

964
01:46:37,554 --> 01:46:42,851
- Hmm. For instance?
- Well...

965
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:49,066
For instance, supposing
I told you that your fly was undone?

966
01:46:50,067 --> 01:46:54,154
By a remarkable coincidence,
so is yours.

967
01:46:54,363 --> 01:46:57,366
Oh, no. Not again.

968
01:46:58,617 --> 01:47:03,163
Ah! I see you are familiar
with the "open fly" ploy.

969
01:47:03,372 --> 01:47:05,332
Well, so am I.

970
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:10,671
You also know the "falling on the bed
with the arm on the floor" ploy.

971
01:47:10,879 --> 01:47:13,799
- He's been shot dead, idiot.
- Don't call me an idiot.

972
01:47:14,007 --> 01:47:16,426
What? Who?

973
01:47:32,818 --> 01:47:34,736
Be careful, darling.

974
01:47:34,945 --> 01:47:37,906
He's either reloading
or out of ammunition.

975
01:47:39,783 --> 01:47:42,494
He's out of his mind,
that's what he's out of.

976
01:47:54,339 --> 01:47:56,717
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

977
01:47:56,925 --> 01:47:58,719
- Monsieur!
- I'll kill you!

978
01:48:05,434 --> 01:48:06,602
Get out of my way!

979
01:48:15,986 --> 01:48:18,572
Chief Inspector Dreyfus was tried

980
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:21,992
and found not guilty,
by reason of insanity.

981
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:26,246
Clouseau, the famous detective,
was decorated by General Wadafi.

982
01:48:26,455 --> 01:48:29,666
Then he went back to France,
where I believe he took over

983
01:48:29,875 --> 01:48:32,586
the position vacated
by the madman, Dreyfus.

984
01:48:33,587 --> 01:48:38,467
There it is, ladies and gentlemen,
the largest diamond in the world.

985
01:48:38,675 --> 01:48:44,306
And surely, the most famous,
or infamous, if you prefer.

986
01:48:44,765 --> 01:48:45,891
The Pink Panther.

987
01:48:46,099 --> 01:48:47,893
What ever happened to Sir Charles?

988
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:52,064
As far as anyone knows,
he still is living the quiet life

989
01:48:52,272 --> 01:48:54,941
at his villa in the South of France.

990
01:48:55,359 --> 01:49:00,197
Although there has been a rumour that
the notorious Phantom is back at work,

991
01:49:00,405 --> 01:49:05,077
and although it has long been suspected
that Sir Charles and the Phantom

992
01:49:05,285 --> 01:49:09,498
are one and the same,
it has never been proved.

993
01:49:12,542 --> 01:49:13,835
Mark my words, François.

994
01:49:14,544 --> 01:49:16,838
Before the week is out,
I will have proof that

995
01:49:17,047 --> 01:49:19,383
Sir Charles Litton is the Phantom.

996
01:49:19,591 --> 01:49:22,844
- Did you enjoy your food?
- Oh, yes, yes. Very nice.

997
01:49:23,053 --> 01:49:26,390
You've probably guessed
I have a passion for the Oriental food.

998
01:49:27,891 --> 01:49:30,185
Cato usually does some cooking for me,

999
01:49:30,394 --> 01:49:33,313
but recently he's taken to
attacking me at every chance.

1000
01:49:33,522 --> 01:49:35,565
It's very bad for the digestion.

1001
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,280
That is very strange, François.

1002
01:49:42,697 --> 01:49:48,286
I don't ever recall receiving the
fortune cookie in a Japanese restaurant.

1003
01:49:48,495 --> 01:49:50,831
- What does it say?
- We shall see...

1004
01:49:54,626 --> 01:50:00,423
"Beware of Japanese waitress
bearing fortune cookies."

1005
01:50:01,883 --> 01:50:04,094
Japanese waitress?

1006
01:50:10,934 --> 01:50:12,894
Cato, get off!

1007
01:50:14,396 --> 01:50:15,522
Cato!

1008
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:17,691
No, you idiot!

1009
01:50:23,113 --> 01:50:25,448
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry. I beg your...

1010
01:50:36,459 --> 01:50:38,503
Stop, Cato! Enough, enough!

1011
01:50:39,671 --> 01:50:41,047
Enough, I say!

1012
01:50:41,256 --> 01:50:43,884
Get your hands off of me!

1013
01:50:44,634 --> 01:50:47,053
You must remember
my new position in the force!

1014
01:50:47,262 --> 01:50:50,348
You have devastated
my sukiyaki in there.

1015
01:50:50,724 --> 01:50:53,560
You fool! You raving Oriental idiot!

1016
01:50:53,852 --> 01:50:56,897
There is a time and a place
for everything, Cato!

1017
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,482
And this is it.

1018
01:51:47,238 --> 01:51:49,282
Kill him! Kill him!
