1
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,321
Before the dawn of history,

2
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,156
Even since the first man
discovered his soul,

3
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,525
He has struggled against the forces.

4
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,997
That sought to enslave him.

5
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,170
He saw the awful power of nature.

6
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,895
Arrayed against him.

7
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,575
The evil eye of the lightning,

8
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,939
The terrifying voice of the thunder,

9
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,741
The shrieking, wind-filled darkness.

10
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,215
Enslaving his mind
with shackles of fear.

11
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,447
Fear bred superstition,
blinding his reason.

12
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:33,992
He was ridden by a host of devil gods.

13
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:39,293
Human dignity perished
on the altar of idolatry.

14
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,969
And tyranny arose,

15
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,197
Grinding the human spirit
beneath the conqueror's heel.

16
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:49,310
But deep in man's heart still burned.

17
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:53,141
The unquenchable will for freedom.

18
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:57,809
When this divine spark flames
in the soul of some mortal...

19
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,715
Whether priest or soldier,

20
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:01,719
Artist or patriot,

21
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:03,950
Lover or statesman...

22
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:07,426
His deeds have changed
the course of human events.

23
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:11,158
And his name survives the ages.

24
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:12,926
I n the village of Norah,

25
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:14,968
In the land of Dan,

26
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:18,664
1,000 years before the birth of Christ,

27
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:20,936
Lived such a man.

28
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:26,174
In him, the elements had fused
greatness and weakness,

29
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:28,318
Strength and folly.

30
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,320
But with these, was a bold dream...

31
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:35,221
Liberty for his nation.

32
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:37,952
The man's name was Samson.

33
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:39,630
For 40 years,

34
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:46,293
The philistines had held
his people in bondage.

35
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:53,569
I drove three score goats to Zorah
seeking for a wife.

36
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:01,243
But her father said get more
or you'll lead a lonely life...

37
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,416
And he said,

38
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,958
When you return to Egypt,

39
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:13,691
See that you do all the wonders
which I have put in your hand.

40
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:16,495
And the lord said unto Moses,

41
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:23,133
Get you up unto pharaoh
and bring forth my people out of Egypt.

42
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:25,808
Pharaoh ruled the Egyptians.

43
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:28,379
As the saran rules
the philistines here...

44
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,017
And the philistines rule us.

45
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,153
Saul, let him tell it.

46
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:34,721
Pharaoh said to Moses,

47
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:36,983
Who is this lord?

48
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:39,319
I know him not.

49
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:43,931
Your people are my slaves,
and I will not let them go.

50
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,532
But they got away through the Red Sea.

51
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:49,101
Someday, we'll show the saran.

52
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:52,935
That stone can fly just as straight
as philistine spears.

53
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:55,167
Tell him what that slingshot's for.

54
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,037
Yes, tell him.

55
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:59,808
Guard your tongue, Saul.

56
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:03,508
Some thoughts must not be spoken.

57
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,417
May I fill my pitcher, Miriam?

58
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:08,320
We'll fill it together,
little Samaritan.

59
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:11,585
And the lord spoke unto Moses
and to Aaron,

60
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:16,961
Saying, when pharaoh shall say unto you.

61
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,296
Show a miracle for you...
Then you shall...

62
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:24,566
You shall swallow your tongue, old goat.

63
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:26,676
Now, here's something
for you to learn...

64
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,109
Bow when a philistine passes!

65
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,839
We are a conquered people.

66
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,382
We bow only to the invisible lord.

67
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:36,419
Every philistine is your lord.

68
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:37,919
Bow!

69
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:39,216
Look, you scum of Dan,

70
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,222
Here's how to greet your masters.

71
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,018
Brave philistines...

72
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,562
Showing your courage
against children and old men.

73
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:49,669
Well...

74
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,235
Here's a jug of Dante wine.

75
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,530
We haven't tasted

76
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,230
if you come near Miriam,

77
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:58,103
Samson will crack your head
like a walnut.

78
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:01,248
Samson!

79
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,053
He saves his strength for the wenches!

80
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:09,247
The power of the lord
is in Samson's arm,

81
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,015
And, one day, you shall feel it.

82
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:14,126
Croak in the mud, old frog.

83
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:16,126
Ha ha ha ha!

84
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:17,525
Ha ha ha ha!

85
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,165
Run! Get off the street!

86
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,268
Let the old mud turtle, yell for Samson!

87
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,472
Ha ha ha ha!

88
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,339
Go on, Saul, throw it.

89
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,568
Aim for the big one.

90
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:29,709
No, Saul, no.

91
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:30,844
I'll stop one of them.

92
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,574
You will bring death to the village.

93
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:38,743
Samson is our warrior.

94
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:44,252
A leader... you? Ha.

95
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,951
Certainly, I know where you were.

96
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:48,255
Lesh Lakish told me.

97
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,661
You were brawling through
the streets of Timnath.

98
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:52,130
With the philistines,

99
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,804
Drinking and dice-throwing
with our enemies.

100
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,132
I was learning their ways.

101
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:59,434
You'd better learn the ways of the lord.

102
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:01,975
Mm-mmm. You're the best cook in Zorah.

103
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,443
And you're the worst son.

104
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:06,776
You, the leader of Dan,

105
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:08,748
Chosen judge of you're people.

106
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:10,046
And what would you do?

107
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:12,189
Marry a daughter of our enemies.

108
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,555
A philistine to be the mother
of Samson's children.

109
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:21,132
I ought to spank you as I did,
and not so long ago.

110
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:25,202
Run along,
or your mother will tan your hide, too.

111
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:28,397
Yeah, that's the truth.

112
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,543
Now look what you've done.

113
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:34,201
Oh, you're a stubborn, witless ox.

114
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:37,350
I'm your son.

115
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:38,585
Oh, Samson,

116
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:40,550
Why can't you be like
our neighbors' sons...

117
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:42,949
Content to watch their fathers' flocks.

118
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:45,125
And choose a wife from our own village?

119
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:46,485
Forbidden figs are sweeter.

120
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,785
But the sweetest figs grow.

121
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:50,487
Right in your own garden.

122
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:53,428
Miriam's hands are never idle.

123
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:56,035
No cross words ever pass her lips.

124
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:57,534
You would harness this angel.

125
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,536
To a stubborn, witless ox?

126
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:02,209
You're not all bad, Samson.

127
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:04,607
But your eyes always find
what they shouldn't.

128
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:05,906
Why, a wife like Miriam.

129
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:10,313
Would bring out the good in you.

130
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,200
A man must marry.

131
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:14,982
Where his heart leads him,
little mother.

132
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,659
A man's heart can be blind, son.

133
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,555
Samson, Samson!

134
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:21,526
Some philistine soldiers at the well.

135
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:22,611
Who this time, father?

136
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,097
The old storyteller.

137
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:26,394
The soldiers left, the trouble's passed.

138
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:28,468
The trouble with him isn't passed.

139
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,161
Tell Miriam.

140
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,305
Now, Hazell.

141
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:34,602
Wait and hear what your son is about.

142
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,905
Go on. Tell her.

143
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:41,084
Go on.

144
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:51,959
This time, you must have done something
really terrible.

145
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:56,429
Miriam, you're further
above me than the moon.

146
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:59,160
But not as hard to reach.

147
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,965
Only stretch out your hand.

148
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:05,735
I don't want to hurt you, Miriam.

149
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:10,176
You're like a sparrow, so gentle and...

150
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:12,407
That's a very gentle way of telling me.

151
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:16,646
That you're in love with someone else.

152
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:18,056
You always see through people.

153
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:22,423
As... if they were cobwebs.

154
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,760
I hear you saw a woman in Timnath.

155
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,367
Yes...

156
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:34,529
And I can't forget her.

157
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:38,408
It is the same with me.

158
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:42,571
I can't forget you.

159
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:48,222
Miriam.

160
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,419
I'll always be here.

161
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:09,135
What did I tell you?

162
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:15,306
He wants to marry a philistine.

163
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,316
Samson...

164
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:21,388
You would not bring this shame upon us.

165
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:23,423
There's no shame in marriage, father.

166
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:25,288
To a philistine woman?

167
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:28,954
Father, Semadar pleases me.

168
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,394
Go to Tubal of Timnath.

169
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:32,203
And say I will take
his daughter to wife.

170
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,961
The law forbids it.

171
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:36,868
A philistine law?

172
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,045
Samson.

173
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:47,942
Oh, Samson, what will come to you
on the road you're traveling?

174
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:50,547
A golden-haired wife, little mother,

175
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,817
Who won't beat me with wooden spoons.

176
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,324
Ohh... oh, Samson, Samson,

177
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,326
You're blind.

178
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,829
You turn away from Mirian,

179
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,094
From everything that's good
in your life!

180
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:09,241
Just because he's seen a woman
at Timnath...

181
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:15,403
A woman in silks and jewels.

182
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,408
Ohh...

183
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,284
Magnificent.

184
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:24,925
Ooh, Your rich gifts.

185
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:26,594
Rob me of words, Ahtur.

186
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:28,819
They'll rob you of a daughter, Tubal,

187
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:34,991
And enrich me with a wife.

188
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:37,406
The military governor of Dan.

189
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,541
Does my house great honor.

190
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:43,074
Semadar is a fit mate for a soldier.

191
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,078
Now, here's a new weave
from the looms of Gaza.

192
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:51,241
They call it gauze.

193
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,481
Oh, beautiful...

194
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:55,715
Beautiful!

195
00:15:55,926 --> 00:16:01,295
Take it over to the light.

196
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:02,589
Semadar.

197
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,768
Semada...

198
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:18,443
But you haven't even shown...

199
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:19,775
She throws the javelin.

200
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:21,382
Like the goddess Dictynna.

201
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:22,507
I'm taking her with me.

202
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:25,953
On the saran's lion hunt...
With your permission.

203
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:30,184
Oh, yes, of... of course, of course.

204
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:32,295
You know, I have another daughter...

205
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:34,260
Semadar's younger sister.

206
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:39,427
Oh, unbelievable beauty.

207
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:46,634
That's a good throw.

208
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:52,808
But the lion's heart's at the other end.

209
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,229
Have you lost your senses?

210
00:16:57,257 --> 00:17:01,522
The hunting party and
the saran are coming from Gaza.

211
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:02,524
I'll help him kill the lion.

212
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:05,197
You'd rather help the lion
kill the saran.

213
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:07,663
Not until he gives permission
for our marriage.

214
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,427
Our marriage?

215
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:11,433
You have lost your senses.

216
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,766
And my heart.

217
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:17,240
You've whispered that
in a lot of pretty ears.

218
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:22,405
None as pretty as yours.

219
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:33,553
My sister does her lion
hunting with plum pits.

220
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:36,721
Be good, now,
or the game may eat the hunter.

221
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:41,869
I can't really blame her
for hunting you.

222
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:44,869
Samson, you are rather like a lion.

223
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:47,133
Then you should learn more
about lion hunting.

224
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:49,742
Proud and strong and fearless.

225
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:52,379
But not very wise.

226
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:53,641
Ahtur.

227
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,945
Here. I brought a thorn for a rose.

228
00:17:57,153 --> 00:17:59,747
Oh, thank you, Ahtur.

229
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,949
Balances perfectly.

230
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,384
There's only one Danite.

231
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:11,502
Fool enough to climb this wall.

232
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:18,199
The governor of Dan has a hunter's eye.

233
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,289
I just told Semadar...

234
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:23,437
Yes, I heard you.

235
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:27,976
You'll hunt from my chariot today,
Semadar.

236
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:33,385
Samson thinks he can help us
kill the lion.

237
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:35,617
We're very grateful,

238
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:37,159
But the lord of the five cities,

239
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:40,595
Whose conquests reach
from the Nile to Babylon,

240
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:45,396
May succeed without the assistance
of a judge of shepherds.

241
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:49,474
A shepherd needs to know
more about lions than a king.

242
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:51,404
His life depends upon it.

243
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,044
A shepherd obeys the law.

244
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:55,478
His life depends on that.

245
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:57,810
The first law your fathers learned.

246
00:18:58,052 --> 00:19:02,784
Was to bow before philistine spears.

247
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,757
You like to have people
bow to the might of spears.

248
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:10,897
I like to have spears...

249
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,069
Bow to people.

250
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,038
Especially beautiful women.

251
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,082
You destroy a weapon.

252
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,442
You lack the skillto use.

253
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:28,048
Perhaps Semadar will teach me...

254
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,717
After our marriage.

255
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,854
Marriage to...

256
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:41,027
Your humor is even greater than
your strength.

257
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:41,856
The saran.

258
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:49,562
The judge of Dan would do well
to leave the way he came...

259
00:19:54,579 --> 00:20:00,539
And seek a bride in some other pasture.

260
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:06,754
Ahtur! Ahtur!

261
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,152
Hail, great majesty.

262
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,226
Hail!

263
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:12,625
I don't like Ahtur either.

264
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:16,790
Water for the horses!

265
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:23,100
Hunt your lion with that, nimrod.

266
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:26,972
If you killed the lion,
they'd call you great.

267
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,204
I can bend their spears,

268
00:20:28,414 --> 00:20:29,694
But I can't outrun their horses.

269
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:32,112
I could get you there first.

270
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:36,277
We have stables.

271
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:41,122
What's your price?

272
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:45,287
Take me with you.

273
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,367
You're a bold little monkey.

274
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:52,528
What's your name?

275
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:56,911
Delilah.

276
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:03,017
Come on.

277
00:21:19,502 --> 00:21:21,231
Faster, Samson, faster!

278
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:22,597
Hold tight to the railing!

279
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:23,863
I'll hold tight to you!

280
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:25,405
Be careful, you'll fall out!

281
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:27,076
No, I won't!

282
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:29,871
Semadar doesn't love your strength
like I do.

283
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,174
I'd love to feel the power of your arms.

284
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:35,577
I'd rather feel a wildcat on my back!

285
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:37,343
Will you tame me, Samson?

286
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:39,146
I'll use you for lion bait!

287
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:43,316
I don't see any lion!

288
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:48,666
Aah!

289
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,735
Whoa.

290
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:03,640
Kill him before they arrive.

291
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:08,218
I won't need it. He's a young lion.

292
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,390
Samson!

293
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:18,491
You're more trouble than...

294
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:19,255
I'm afraid!

295
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:25,428
Get up on that rock and don't move.

296
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:36,038
Look out!

297
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:29,229
Samson. Samson!

298
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,393
You killed him with your hands.

299
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:31,663
Oh, Samson.

300
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:36,366
Hey, one cat at a time.

301
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:38,944
What's the matter with you?

302
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:39,646
I love you.

303
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:40,782
That's what's the matter with me...

304
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:43,952
I love you.

305
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:50,192
Lion ho!

306
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:56,190
Halt the hunt!

307
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:00,358
The beast is slain.

308
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:11,343
Delilah.

309
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:13,345
Semadar, the saran.

310
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,347
Who is this girl?

311
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:17,384
My sister, lord saran.

312
00:25:17,588 --> 00:25:19,268
I don't know how she came here
with this...

313
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:21,018
Danite, isn't he?

314
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:24,786
Perhaps this blossom from Tubal's garden
can enlighten us.

315
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:26,793
Oh, yes, majesty, I can.

316
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:29,592
Samson killed the lion
with his bare hands.

317
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:34,170
Never has there been such power
in any man.

318
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:39,901
Your sister has a lively imagination.

319
00:25:40,111 --> 00:25:44,412
So you're Samson,
the brawling troublemaker.

320
00:25:44,617 --> 00:25:45,914
The saran knows me.

321
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:48,245
Yes, and no good of you.

322
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:51,923
Come here, girl.

323
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:54,251
You say he used no weapon?

324
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,258
Just his two hands, lord saran.

325
00:25:56,463 --> 00:25:58,454
He was magnificent.

326
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:00,928
Only a god could do what he did.

327
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:03,261
Well, Danite, you have one worshiper.

328
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,131
Ahtur, examine the beast.

329
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:07,534
Find the mark of the javelin.

330
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:08,435
But I...

331
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:14,604
Delilah, get down. Have you no respect?

332
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:23,255
There's no blood.

333
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,688
They would must be on the other side.

334
00:26:25,892 --> 00:26:29,489
The body's warm.

335
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:31,598
There is no mark upon the skin.

336
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,030
What?

337
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:37,967
I said there wasn't.

338
00:26:38,173 --> 00:26:41,142
No mark?

339
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:42,444
Would you have us believe.

340
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:46,313
The beast dropped dead from fear?

341
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:48,540
The girl told you the truth.

342
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:51,845
What you believe is your affair.

343
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:54,818
I should like to see this strength.

344
00:26:55,024 --> 00:26:56,788
Garmiskar!

345
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:58,154
Now you'll see fur fly.

346
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:04,267
You'll see some blood flow.

347
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:07,096
Break this boaster's bones.

348
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:08,032
I have no quarrel.

349
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,500
With your warrior.

350
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:12,108
What kind of courage claims
to face a lion.

351
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,039
And fears my wrestler?

352
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:18,579
Then man has done me no harm.

353
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:19,909
Fight him, Samson.

354
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:23,087
Fight him.

355
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:35,129
Like all boasters, he's a coward.

356
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:41,295
Garmiskar... let him feel the whip.

357
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:45,436
Now watch.

358
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:48,444
Heh heh heh.

359
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:51,617
Oh!

360
00:27:58,091 --> 00:28:00,526
Garmiskar's down! Get up!

361
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:02,628
He's near 400 pounds.

362
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:08,736
He threw him like a sack of grain.

363
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:31,427
The hunter's prize is yours.

364
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:35,762
One ring for two lions.

365
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,490
I would like to name my own prize.

366
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:40,260
Oh, yes?

367
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:42,872
What would you have...

368
00:28:43,073 --> 00:28:45,440
My throne?

369
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,009
I would take a philistine bride.

370
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,941
The girl seems willing enough.

371
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:51,948
I need men like you.

372
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:53,708
If a pretty face binds you to me,

373
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:54,976
Yours request is granted.

374
00:28:55,185 --> 00:28:59,145
Choose your bride.

375
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:11,198
This is the woman I take.

376
00:29:11,402 --> 00:29:13,997
But Semadar is promised to me.

377
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:20,167
I have given my word, Ahtur.

378
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:23,944
She is yours.

379
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,673
And 100 pieces of silver.

380
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:27,750
You have given me a great treasure.

381
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:31,355
Will you accept the lion's skin?

382
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:32,490
As a peace offering,

383
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:36,253
From one prince to another.

384
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:36,928
Is it wise to have.

385
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:39,155
This mad dog in our city?

386
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:44,360
He might be tamed in our city.

387
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:46,472
Lord saran,

388
00:29:46,674 --> 00:29:48,335
Samson could make no trouble

389
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:51,000
if Ahtur brought 30 of his warriors.

390
00:29:51,211 --> 00:29:53,577
To the wedding feast.

391
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:55,476
This girl has the wisdom of a serpent.

392
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:58,517
Ride home together and discuss
the choice of wedding companions.

393
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,312
Hunt home!

394
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:03,491
Hunt home!

395
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:28,212
Look! The feather Dance!

396
00:30:28,418 --> 00:30:29,298
Feather against sword.

397
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:32,547
Feather always wins.

398
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:38,750
It's nothing more than a witch's trick.

399
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,354
No man can kill a lion.

400
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:43,055
With his bare hands.

401
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,348
Who saw him kill the beast?

402
00:30:44,502 --> 00:30:50,463
You saw him throw Garmiskar.

403
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:56,011
Why aren't you entertaining
the wedding guests?

404
00:30:56,214 --> 00:30:59,184
They hate him.

405
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:02,780
Because he's a Danite?

406
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:05,718
Because he's a fool.

407
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:08,722
Most man are, Delilah.

408
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:13,057
There is nothing you can do about it.

409
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:19,227
Sometimes a bee can move an ox.

410
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,809
A man shouldn't have to reach
at his own wedding feast.

411
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:28,480
The most desirable grapes.

412
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:31,618
Not if you reach high enough.

413
00:31:31,818 --> 00:31:33,946
You waited too long, Ahtur.

414
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:35,314
For what?

415
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:37,286
Entertainment.

416
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,185
What will you choose? Wine...

417
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:41,122
Beauty... Song?

418
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:42,989
I have wine.

419
00:31:43,197 --> 00:31:45,359
You have beauty.

420
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:47,967
And Samson has a voice.

421
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:53,540
Sing us one of your shepherd songs,
Samson.

422
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:54,862
My singing sounds more like.

423
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:59,936
The bleating of my sheep.

424
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:03,141
But I will set you a riddle.

425
00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:05,512
Can he make one?

426
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:06,916
Speak up, strong man!

427
00:32:07,122 --> 00:32:07,713
I didn't know he could.

428
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:08,652
What riddle?

429
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,620
Tell us.

430
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:16,994
Out of the eater came forth meat.

431
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:21,034
Out of the strong came forth sweetness.

432
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:25,607
Out of the eater came forth...

433
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:28,276
That's a fool's riddle.

434
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,004
Then answer it.

435
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,273
There's no sense to it.

436
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,314
Sweetness from the strong?

437
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,678
He's twisting words.

438
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,649
Why, by the seven planets,

439
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,381
That's no riddle at all.

440
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,582
It's not a riddle without a wager.

441
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,092
Or without gold.

442
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,389
What gold can Samson wager?

443
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,569
There are many kinds of gold.

444
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,704
There is the gold in Semadar's hair.

445
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:56,203
But we won't wager that.

446
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,207
There is the gold thread of a cloak.

447
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,106
That I will wager.

448
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:01,837
If you guess the riddle,

449
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,346
I'll pay each of you a new garment.

450
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,279
All 30 of us?

451
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:07,577
All 30.

452
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:08,686
30 garments?

453
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:09,877
That's a heavy wager.

454
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,078
How can he pay?

455
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,384
With 30 lion skins?

456
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,427
We'll get all shepherd cloaks.

457
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,961
Where would he get 30 garments?

458
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:19,861
One for each of us!

459
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:20,964
Take care.

460
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:23,432
Samson is clever at trapping foxes.

461
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:25,128
You may lose.

462
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:28,432
Then we'll pay him a change of garments.

463
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:29,735
All 30?

464
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:31,001
All 30.

465
00:33:31,212 --> 00:33:33,077
Agreed! It's a wager!

466
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:35,272
30 garments. It's a bargain!

467
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:36,644
Leave them with your riddle.

468
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:39,479
While I put on my wedding veil.

469
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:42,485
Out of the strong came forth sweetness.

470
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:44,955
Hah! The fruit of the date palm!

471
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,857
The tree is strong,
and the fruit is sweet.

472
00:33:48,063 --> 00:33:49,462
What do you feed date palms.

473
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:53,625
To make them eaters?

474
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:58,003
Why it's a hawk's egg.
A hawk is an eater.

475
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:01,507
And the egg is strong.

476
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:03,201
Find the answer before the wedding.

477
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:06,850
Samson will have no time
for riddles afterwards.

478
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,483
Father, take him,

479
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:09,777
But bring him back to me.

480
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:11,281
I could not keep him away.

481
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:12,681
You tried hard enough.

482
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:19,227
Musicians, play among the guests
while we prepare.

483
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,796
That scurvy riddle has no answer.

484
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:22,727
It's a cheat!

485
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,332
It's a Danite trick!

486
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:26,299
Every riddle has an answer,

487
00:34:26,503 --> 00:34:28,971
Only you're too stupid to find it.

488
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:31,233
Find it? Where?

489
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:35,174
Not in your wine cup, Gammad.

490
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,405
Sharpen your wits, not your teeth.

491
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:38,878
What?

492
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:41,279
Don't you see Samson is laughing at you?

493
00:34:41,486 --> 00:34:42,249
Laughing?

494
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:43,614
At us?

495
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:45,017
He's smarter than you.

496
00:34:45,224 --> 00:34:46,657
Has he told you the answer?

497
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:49,260
No, but...

498
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,157
I know someone who can get it.

499
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:52,991
Who?

500
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,689
Tell us.

501
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:55,731
Semadar.

502
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:57,425
Semadar?

503
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,264
Yes, by Dagon, she'll tell,

504
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,074
Or I'll wring the answer
from her throat.

505
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:03,108
I'll pay no forfeit
to that Danite clown.

506
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,106
Oh, yes, you will.

507
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,209
You made a wager.

508
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:08,904
Before I pay, I'll burn this house.

509
00:35:09,116 --> 00:35:10,606
You don't know Samson.

510
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,910
Samson...

511
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,178
it would be much safer

512
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:17,358
if Ahtur got the answer from Semadar.

513
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:18,616
Yes. Semadar.

514
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,726
Clever girl.

515
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:26,868
Women always yield to Ahtur.

516
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:32,487
Why should our guests.

517
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:35,068
Care about a stupid game of words?

518
00:35:35,277 --> 00:35:36,972
It's no game to them.

519
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:38,874
It's Danite against philistine.

520
00:35:39,114 --> 00:35:41,207
The wine has dulled their senses.

521
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,783
It hasn't dulled their anger.

522
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:45,146
You're trying to frighten me.

523
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:46,928
Because you don't want me
to marry Samson.

524
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:50,393
I don't want you to marry Samson,

525
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:53,390
But there's hatred at
your wedding feast.

526
00:35:53,596 --> 00:35:55,723
They think you've joined
Samson against us.

527
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:57,799
But I haven't.

528
00:35:58,001 --> 00:35:59,093
Tell them I haven't.

529
00:35:59,302 --> 00:36:00,565
No.

530
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:04,262
You tell them the answer to the riddle.

531
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:06,305
But I don't know it.

532
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,000
Unfortunate.

533
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:11,340
Ahtur, Samson has told me nothing.

534
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:12,914
Surely he'll share the answer.

535
00:36:13,116 --> 00:36:15,813
With so lovely a bride.

536
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:17,215
But if he won't?

537
00:36:17,421 --> 00:36:18,411
Get it...

538
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:24,584
Or death may solve the Danite's riddle.

539
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:38,004
I mean no more to you...

540
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:39,803
Than those strangers down there.

541
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:41,480
Semadar, don't cry.

542
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:43,046
I can't stand tears.

543
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:44,681
You don't love me.

544
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:45,909
But Semadar, look...

545
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,610
No! Go away.

546
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:50,085
I've told no one the answer.

547
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:51,655
Our wedding night...

548
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:53,884
And to you I am no one.

549
00:36:54,093 --> 00:36:56,426
Women.

550
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:59,599
Won't you make me happy?

551
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,701
Tell me the riddle's answer.

552
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:04,269
You could please me so much.

553
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,337
If a honeycomb pleases you,

554
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,509
A lion will not keep us apart.

555
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:10,108
Honeycomb!

556
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,972
Ls that the answer?

557
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:14,580
Remember that lion I killed?

558
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:17,309
The sun had bleached its bones,

559
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,886
And wild bees had swarmed there.

560
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:21,920
Oh, Samson!

561
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:24,318
That was the honeycomb you brought me.

562
00:37:24,527 --> 00:37:25,993
What is sweeter than honey?

563
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:32,189
What is stronger than a lion?

564
00:37:42,212 --> 00:37:42,939
Semadar!

565
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:44,942
What a beautiful bride!

566
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:47,344
Lucky Samson!

567
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:48,712
Too good for a Danite!

568
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,682
Semadar, as pretty as a pearl!
Before this company,

569
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:52,549
I give my daughter, Semadar,

570
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:56,454
To Samson in marriage.

571
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,320
Lucky Samson!

572
00:37:57,527 --> 00:38:01,226
What is sweeter than honey, Samson?

573
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:03,731
Tell us...

574
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:07,371
What is stronger than a lion?

575
00:38:07,573 --> 00:38:10,006
Ahtur has won the Danite's wager.

576
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:14,168
Or the Danite's bride.

577
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:15,504
A clever riddle.

578
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:16,908
Cleverly answered.

579
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:19,482
Now, Samson, take the wine cup.

580
00:38:19,686 --> 00:38:21,550
Pay your wager, bridegroom.

581
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:23,345
A change of garment for each!

582
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:24,488
Before we leave.

583
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,351
A red cloak is what I want.

584
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,719
So the wine spots don't show.

585
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:30,224
A wool tunic for me.

586
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,762
To keep out the foul air of Dan.

587
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:34,263
Bring me an embroidered robe.

588
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:36,492
To dazzle the wenches.

589
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:39,195
I'll settle for a cloak of silver.

590
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:42,238
If you hadn't plowed with my heifer,

591
00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:44,910
You would not have answered my riddle.

592
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,070
You're a bad loser, strong man.

593
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:48,975
Pay your debt.

594
00:38:49,183 --> 00:38:51,413
I'll pay my debt.

595
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,587
The same way you found the answer.

596
00:38:53,788 --> 00:38:55,618
A red cloak is what I want.

597
00:38:55,823 --> 00:38:59,021
You'll get your red cloak.

598
00:38:59,226 --> 00:39:00,750
You'll get your shirt of wool.

599
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:02,327
With gold thread!

600
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:04,226
And you, your silver cloak.

601
00:39:04,432 --> 00:39:07,630
You'll all be paid in full.

602
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:11,294
You cheat before our wedding's done.

603
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:14,101
The cats from the Timnath alleys.

604
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:16,210
Could learn much from you.

605
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:18,403
She stands with us.

606
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:23,074
You'd do well to return to your people.

607
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:26,120
I'll return.

608
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:30,691
But first I must pay the debt
to your people.

609
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:32,192
Or pay your wager.

610
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:33,658
I'll be waiting for you.

611
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:35,058
Samson!

612
00:39:35,265 --> 00:39:35,959
Samson!

613
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:37,225
Let him go, father.

614
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:38,958
But the saran gave her to Samson.

615
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:42,105
Samson called her a cat
from the alleys of Timnath.

616
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:45,070
This is terrible.
He doesn't want her now.

617
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:47,336
But Ahtur does.

618
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:48,204
Ahtur!

619
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:53,874
And the bridal chamber
is waiting for a bride.

620
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:56,447
Good sense in that pretty head.

621
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:59,214
Ahtur!

622
00:39:59,424 --> 00:40:05,261
The trouble you brew today,
you'll drink tomorrow.

623
00:40:05,464 --> 00:40:12,870
I'd rather be a merchant than
a captain of the fleet.

624
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:18,138
The saran owns a palace.

625
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:22,247
The jester owns an ass.

626
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:24,576
Oh! Help!

627
00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:26,342
Help!

628
00:40:26,553 --> 00:40:27,645
Mercy!

629
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:29,617
Help, god!

630
00:40:29,823 --> 00:40:30,949
We've been robbed!

631
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:31,656
A giant!

632
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:33,019
Dagon, protect us!

633
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:34,183
He'll kill us!

634
00:40:34,395 --> 00:40:35,953
Thieves! Mercy!

635
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:36,993
Thieves!

636
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:39,325
Help!

637
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:41,262
Help! Help!

638
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:43,596
Some demon fell upon me.

639
00:40:43,804 --> 00:40:45,065
And stole my best tunic.

640
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:45,898
A demon?

641
00:40:46,107 --> 00:40:47,005
Big as a camel...

642
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,109
My clothes! My red cloak!

643
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:49,970
They're gone!

644
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:50,906
I can see that.

645
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:53,307
A giant hurled me in the air...

646
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:55,107
I tried to fight him...

647
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:56,340
Peace! Peace!

648
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:57,779
Wait! Speak sense!

649
00:40:57,986 --> 00:40:59,920
My flowered robe...
it's stolen.

650
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:02,113
The one my wife made for me.

651
00:41:02,324 --> 00:41:02,882
She'll never believe me.

652
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:04,422
I demand a search!

653
00:41:04,627 --> 00:41:05,616
My red cloak!

654
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:08,353
My coat of silver cloth!

655
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:12,796
We came for a wedding,
and we had a wedding.

656
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:15,562
You're not leaving
before the Danite's paid his wager?

657
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:17,673
His debt is as bad as his riddle.

658
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,864
He won't come back.

659
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:19,770
Oh, yes, he will.

660
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:24,107
I'll spit him like a fatted calf.

661
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,215
There's your tunic with threads of gold.

662
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:29,977
Here's your fatted calf, Targil.

663
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:30,949
A red cloak,

664
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:33,886
The color of your nose, Gammad.

665
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,320
Here, Teresh.

666
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:36,527
Wear this over your head,

667
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,357
So the wenches can't see your face.

668
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:39,461
Hey! Wait!

669
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,325
And you, Gergam,

670
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:42,829
You want a silver cloak?

671
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:47,061
Find it yourself,
there's 30 to choose from.

672
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:50,105
Hey! Hey! Hey!

673
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:52,743
Where did he get such garments?

674
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,606
Now you're paid.

675
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,678
The lot of you.

676
00:41:56,882 --> 00:42:00,841
Where's Semadar?

677
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:03,749
Where's Semadar?

678
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:05,218
Oh, wait, wait, Samson.

679
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:06,083
Where's my wife?

680
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:08,056
But she isn't yours. Your said...

681
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,888
Never mind what I said.

682
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,429
You said you were done with her.

683
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:13,591
I thought you hated her.

684
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,963
I gave her to Ahtur.

685
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:18,400
You... Ahtur!

686
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:20,005
He wanted to marry her.

687
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:20,866
What could I do?

688
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:23,270
You wanted no Danite for a son-in-law.

689
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:25,469
Look! Here! Samson.

690
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,839
My other daughter.

691
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:27,810
Take her.

692
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:29,642
She'll make you a much better wife.

693
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,511
She's fairer than Semadar.

694
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,710
Much, much more beautiful.

695
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:36,482
You give me a turnip for...

696
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:38,785
This one is a queen among women.

697
00:42:38,994 --> 00:42:42,485
Samson, look!
Have you ever seen eyes like that?

698
00:42:42,697 --> 00:42:44,221
So full of love for you?

699
00:42:44,432 --> 00:42:46,297
See the whiteness of her skin,

700
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,732
Smooth as a young dove's.

701
00:42:48,938 --> 00:42:50,996
She will grow into a rare blossom.

702
00:42:51,206 --> 00:42:53,003
She'll grow into a Thornbush.

703
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,971
Did a Thornbush steal the chariot.

704
00:42:55,177 --> 00:42:56,235
That took you to the lion?

705
00:42:56,445 --> 00:42:57,685
Did a Thornbush tell the saran.

706
00:42:57,846 --> 00:42:59,747
How you killed it with your bare hands?

707
00:42:59,948 --> 00:43:01,006
No, I did.

708
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:02,013
And he believed me.

709
00:43:02,217 --> 00:43:03,686
Then you chose Semadar.

710
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:04,980
Take your claws out of me.

711
00:43:05,188 --> 00:43:06,656
You'll never get them out of you.

712
00:43:06,856 --> 00:43:09,849
I made Ahtur steal the riddle's secret
from Semadar.

713
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,655
I lied to stop you from marrying her.

714
00:43:13,863 --> 00:43:16,354
You're the only thing
in the world I want.

715
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,002
Hold this fork-tongued adder
before I step on her.

716
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:21,933
If you crush the life out of me,

717
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,437
I'll kiss you with my dying breath.

718
00:43:24,642 --> 00:43:28,442
You want me to marry this wild cat?

719
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,376
Let him destroy himself!

720
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:31,581
Oh!

721
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:34,183
Samson!

722
00:43:34,386 --> 00:43:40,347
You'll die for this, you fool!

723
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:51,132
Look! Ahtur is down!

724
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:55,296
Give me a javelin!

725
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,812
Let me out!

726
00:44:00,547 --> 00:44:03,515
My Sword!

727
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:06,945
He's not armed. Charge him!

728
00:44:07,154 --> 00:44:08,086
I'll split that shield!

729
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:09,187
Semadar!

730
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:11,186
Here's a thorn for his ribs.

731
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,289
Inside, Semadar!

732
00:44:12,493 --> 00:44:14,620
Some, Samson, they'll kill us.

733
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:17,763
Look out He's throwing.

734
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:20,935
Lock shields!

735
00:44:22,003 --> 00:44:23,062
Death to her!

736
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:24,966
No, Targil! Hide, Semadar. Hide!

737
00:44:25,173 --> 00:44:26,504
And death to her father!

738
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:27,834
Father.

739
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:29,202
Semadar! No!

740
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,001
Targil!

741
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:33,180
Aah!

742
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:43,258
My daughter!

743
00:44:44,426 --> 00:44:47,395
Burn her and her father.

744
00:44:47,596 --> 00:44:50,565
Carge him!

745
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:57,069
He has the strength of hell.

746
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:59,265
He'll bleed like any man!

747
00:44:59,476 --> 00:45:02,309
You came to this house
as wedding guests.

748
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:06,246
Fire and death are your gifts
to my bride.

749
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,578
For all that I do against you now,

750
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:12,813
I shall be blameless.

751
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:16,482
I'll give you back fire for fire!

752
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:20,654
And death for death.

753
00:45:29,441 --> 00:45:34,903
What invisible power
strikes through his arm?

754
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:51,961
Turn away, little mistress.

755
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:53,996
Don't look anymore.

756
00:45:54,201 --> 00:46:00,663
All you have in the world
is ashes and death.

757
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:03,767
Samson lives.

758
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:06,174
May his flesh rot from his bones.

759
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,542
Be still, old fool.

760
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,808
If it takes all my life,

761
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,546
I'll make him curse the day he was born.

762
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:17,486
He called you a forked-tongue adder.

763
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,685
He's going to feel its sting.

764
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:27,529
What strength can these hands
have against him?

765
00:46:27,737 --> 00:46:34,404
Perhaps greater than a lion's
and softer than a dove's.

766
00:46:34,577 --> 00:46:38,139
I'll find strength, Hisham.

767
00:46:38,347 --> 00:46:43,307
Strength to destroy him.

768
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:48,347
Samson! Samson! Samson!

769
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:51,322
Every Danite sheepherder knows
where to find him,

770
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:53,428
Yet the man's invisible.

771
00:46:53,598 --> 00:46:57,261
I know the Danites worship
an invisible god, Ahtur,

772
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:59,333
But an invisible leader!

773
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:02,471
I've wasted a year
chasing lies and rumors.

774
00:47:02,674 --> 00:47:04,800
I've flogged Danites,
hung them in chains,

775
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:06,033
Burned them,

776
00:47:06,245 --> 00:47:07,609
But they won't give him up.

777
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:11,044
Apparently they love Samson
more than they fear you.

778
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:16,711
Give me 10,000 men,
and like all soldiers,

779
00:47:17,488 --> 00:47:20,982
When you fail by the sword,
you ask for more swords.

780
00:47:21,194 --> 00:47:23,458
You should study the ant.

781
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:26,622
The ant? Yes.

782
00:47:26,866 --> 00:47:29,698
The Babylonians called them Zerbabu.

783
00:47:29,903 --> 00:47:32,963
The Danites call them Nemalah.

784
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:34,503
We call the ants.

785
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:36,039
See how these master ants.

786
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:38,836
Collect food from their slaves.

787
00:47:39,045 --> 00:47:41,514
You might call them tax collectors.

788
00:47:41,715 --> 00:47:44,809
We need soldiers to destroy this Danite.

789
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:47,647
You think so, Ahtur?

790
00:47:47,854 --> 00:47:49,481
I think one tax collector

791
00:47:49,657 --> 00:47:55,653
ls worth a thousand soldiers.

792
00:47:56,897 --> 00:47:58,262
A third of every herd.

793
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:00,866
But our flocks mean our lives.

794
00:48:01,068 --> 00:48:02,933
Their skins clothe us.

795
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:04,901
Their milk feeds our children.

796
00:48:05,106 --> 00:48:08,271
One out of three,
that's the saran's tax.

797
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:09,604
We can't pay such a tax.

798
00:48:09,811 --> 00:48:12,576
You'll pay it until you give us Samson.

799
00:48:12,781 --> 00:48:15,773
Tied up like this.

800
00:48:15,985 --> 00:48:18,350
And next time, I'll take your goats.

801
00:48:18,554 --> 00:48:22,513
Come on, soldier.

802
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:25,854
No! No! Stop!

803
00:48:26,062 --> 00:48:29,396
You tax collectors feed on us
like vultures.

804
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,692
I'll have nothing left to sell.

805
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:34,131
Sell Samson to us, bound.

806
00:48:34,337 --> 00:48:35,862
Bind him?

807
00:48:36,073 --> 00:48:39,509
We can't even find him.

808
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:42,304
You know where he is.

809
00:48:42,513 --> 00:48:45,573
Barbers know all the gossip.

810
00:48:45,783 --> 00:48:46,773
My purse!

811
00:48:46,984 --> 00:48:48,281
My purse!

812
00:48:48,485 --> 00:48:52,115
We'll keep this
until you give up Samson.

813
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:53,620
You'll get Samson...

814
00:48:53,825 --> 00:48:59,786
When the light of the lord goes out.

815
00:49:07,206 --> 00:49:10,607
You take even the light
by which we pray.

816
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,903
You won't pray much longer,

817
00:49:13,112 --> 00:49:14,374
Unless you bring us Samson.

818
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,604
Out of the wilderness.

819
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:19,012
He'll come back to drive you
from our land.

820
00:49:19,218 --> 00:49:21,483
Ti will be a hungry land.

821
00:49:21,688 --> 00:49:23,519
You can starve us with taxes,

822
00:49:23,723 --> 00:49:25,987
Strip our houses, plunder,
burn, and steal,

823
00:49:26,193 --> 00:49:27,421
But we'll never betray Samson.

824
00:49:27,627 --> 00:49:29,424
One rock isn't a mountain, Miriam.

825
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:31,824
One man is not a nation.

826
00:49:32,032 --> 00:49:34,694
Can Samson bring back the grain
to our fields.

827
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:37,234
By burning the philistine's fields?

828
00:49:37,438 --> 00:49:39,030
Can Samson feed our children.

829
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,232
When they cry for food
with the gates of Gaza?

830
00:49:42,443 --> 00:49:44,673
He has done to the philistines
what they did to him.

831
00:49:44,879 --> 00:49:46,210
Who else has stood against them?

832
00:49:46,414 --> 00:49:48,974
He stood against them
for his philistine wife,

833
00:49:49,183 --> 00:49:52,415
Not for us.
His strength is our shield.

834
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:54,088
He has not shielded us.

835
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:57,224
Must we all suffer for
what one man has done?

836
00:49:57,426 --> 00:49:58,757
We will never give him up.

837
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:01,088
We'll bind him and deliver him

838
00:50:01,296 --> 00:50:07,258
lnto the hands of the philistines.

839
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,765
You deliver him to death.

840
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,703
While the strength
of the lord is in him,

841
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,935
No man can bind Samson.

842
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:20,138
He will not raise his hand against us,
grandfather.

843
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,148
He will let himself be bound.

844
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,446
Why will men always betray.

845
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:28,557
The strongest among them?

846
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:35,221
His name will be written
in the book of judges.

847
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:49,136
Bellow, you blustering ox,

848
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:55,308
So the saran can hear you in Gaza.

849
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:07,623
Even a ruby loses luster
besides your lips.

850
00:51:09,802 --> 00:51:12,169
It will take a sapphire
and an emerald together.

851
00:51:12,371 --> 00:51:18,333
To match your blue-green eyes.

852
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,877
I have known the ways of many women.

853
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:25,346
Who fill the veins with fire...

854
00:51:25,553 --> 00:51:29,512
But only one Delilah.

855
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:32,688
My lord has given me many gifts,

856
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:35,488
But none more precious than his favor.

857
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:37,666
Little mistress! Little mistress!

858
00:51:37,865 --> 00:51:39,105
You're forbidden to disturb me.

859
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:41,235
When our lord of Gaza is here.

860
00:51:41,437 --> 00:51:43,370
It's a messenger from the lord general.

861
00:51:43,572 --> 00:51:44,596
He says it mustn't wait!

862
00:51:44,807 --> 00:51:45,831
We'll see no one.

863
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,670
Delilah, what a dimpled dragon
you can be,

864
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:52,176
Flashing fire and smoke.

865
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:54,212
But even your anger charms me.

866
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:56,884
As long as it's directed
at someone else.

867
00:51:57,086 --> 00:52:03,047
The poor Hisham. Let the man in.

868
00:52:08,732 --> 00:52:11,428
Majesty! Speak.

869
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:12,499
Lord Ahtur,

870
00:52:12,702 --> 00:52:15,330
Military governor of Dan,
prince of Philistia,

871
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:17,631
Sends greetings to the saran of Gaza,

872
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:18,773
Majestic...

873
00:52:18,943 --> 00:52:20,102
Yes. Get on with the message.

874
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:23,078
Samson is our prisoner.

875
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:24,042
What have they done with him?

876
00:52:24,248 --> 00:52:25,408
Would you mind if I asked?

877
00:52:25,616 --> 00:52:26,583
Pardon, but...

878
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:29,720
I know, but just leave it to me.

879
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,321
The lord Ahtur is leading Samson,

880
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:33,615
Bound, toward Gaza.

881
00:52:33,824 --> 00:52:35,689
They're but a short distance away.

882
00:52:35,893 --> 00:52:37,452
I've waited a long time.

883
00:52:37,662 --> 00:52:41,621
To hear those words.

884
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:47,028
Such news deserves reward.

885
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:50,208
Withdraw.

886
00:52:51,778 --> 00:52:55,215
That was a very costly jewel.

887
00:52:55,415 --> 00:52:58,748
What will you do with Samson, my lord?

888
00:52:58,951 --> 00:53:00,977
Well, we might hang him by his heels.

889
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:03,211
From your balcony.

890
00:53:03,423 --> 00:53:07,861
Or what would your suggestion be,
Delilah?

891
00:53:08,062 --> 00:53:09,689
Make him turn the gristmill,

892
00:53:09,897 --> 00:53:12,422
Whipped and driven like an animal,

893
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:16,569
Where all Gaza can mock him
and laugh at him.

894
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:17,669
Humble him.

895
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:19,270
Bring him to his knees.

896
00:53:19,473 --> 00:53:22,340
But I thought you once
admired this Danite.

897
00:53:22,544 --> 00:53:26,173
As I admire the gutter-rats of Gaza.

898
00:53:26,381 --> 00:53:29,283
I'm jealous of your hatred.

899
00:53:29,484 --> 00:53:32,647
Don't share even that with anyone else.

900
00:53:32,854 --> 00:53:35,186
We'll chain this lion-killer
to the millstone

901
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:37,552
if that is your wish.

902
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,025
And perhaps arrange
a few other sports for him.

903
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,219
Anything.

904
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:48,392
Only let me be there to watch it.

905
00:54:04,754 --> 00:54:07,655
Unconquerable leader of Danites,

906
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:10,623
Defender of the invisible god.

907
00:54:10,828 --> 00:54:13,228
You're very silent, Samson.

908
00:54:13,431 --> 00:54:15,558
I thought you liked the company
of philistines.

909
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:20,499
He prefers the company of an ass,
lord general.

910
00:54:20,705 --> 00:54:21,899
They have much in common.

911
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:24,770
An ass is wise enough
to obey his master.

912
00:54:24,977 --> 00:54:27,241
Your feet must be tired, Samson.

913
00:54:27,445 --> 00:54:32,406
Why don't you try walking on your knees?

914
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:34,017
Ho ho ho!

915
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:37,188
Ha ha ha!

916
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:40,792
Stand all, stand all!

917
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:45,693
Water bearers, to the ranks.

918
00:54:45,899 --> 00:54:46,399
Ha ha ha!

919
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:50,731
Ha ha ha! Hee haw, hee haw!

920
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:52,837
Let us hear you pray, Samson.

921
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,805
Hee haw, hee haw!

922
00:54:57,011 --> 00:55:00,275
I doubt if prayers would be
much help to him now.

923
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:02,915
His real strength lies in riddles.

924
00:55:03,117 --> 00:55:04,607
Excellent, your excellence.

925
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:08,653
Riddles are the sport of fools.

926
00:55:08,856 --> 00:55:10,825
Then answer this one, Samson.

927
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:15,554
Out of Dan came a killer of beasts.

928
00:55:15,763 --> 00:55:17,755
Whose head will pay for
his wedding feast?

929
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:19,593
Ha ha!

930
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:21,927
Has the pledge of my people
been fulfilled?

931
00:55:22,137 --> 00:55:25,665
Yes, but that's not the answer
to the riddle.

932
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:28,036
Am I truly delivered into your hands?

933
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:32,111
Truly as you're bound by rope.

934
00:55:32,315 --> 00:55:36,809
You seem to have lost
your skill for riddles.

935
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:40,819
This is the place of Lehi.

936
00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:42,753
Even the sky speaks against him.

937
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:44,518
Ha ha!

938
00:55:44,728 --> 00:55:48,288
O lord, my god, hear me.

939
00:55:48,497 --> 00:55:52,024
Gird me for battle against
the swords of my enemies.

940
00:55:52,236 --> 00:55:54,101
Forsake me not, o lord,

941
00:55:54,305 --> 00:55:55,965
But strengthen my arm.

942
00:55:56,174 --> 00:55:59,870
To destroy the lions
who've scattered thy flocks.

943
00:56:00,077 --> 00:56:03,536
Oh, great skull, hear me.

944
00:56:03,748 --> 00:56:06,046
Hee haw. Hee haw!

945
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:12,156
Let them see thy power, o god.

946
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:25,194
They part like burning flax!

947
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:26,769
His god has freed him!

948
00:56:26,972 --> 00:56:27,836
Quick! Take him!

949
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:34,001
Alive if you can! Use chains!

950
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:56,193
Lift it, you fools. My arm's pinned.

951
00:57:26,436 --> 00:57:30,395
Son of the devil!

952
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:55,998
Never did mortal man fight like this.

953
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:57,669
His strength was greater.

954
00:57:57,869 --> 00:57:59,838
Than any instrument of war.

955
00:58:00,038 --> 00:58:02,506
And when he called upon his god,

956
00:58:02,707 --> 00:58:04,800
The thunder and the whirlwind
and the lightning.

957
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,101
Were in his blows.

958
00:58:06,312 --> 00:58:08,677
A hundred killed, perhaps a thousand.

959
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:12,044
There was no counting the slain.

960
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:15,084
But what weapon had he?

961
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:20,418
More shame to us...
The jawbone of an ass.

962
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:22,322
A jester's toy?

963
00:58:22,528 --> 00:58:25,761
No sword of iron ever struck such blows.

964
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:32,530
Men fell before him like wheat
before the scythe.

965
00:58:32,739 --> 00:58:33,330
Can this be? Who is this man?

966
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,532
But had we no chariots to rid him down?

967
00:58:36,743 --> 00:58:39,303
He overturned chariots
with a single move.

968
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:42,074
He fought within a gorge so narrow,

969
00:58:42,283 --> 00:58:44,581
We trampled on the dying to attack him.

970
00:58:44,786 --> 00:58:46,845
And those behind pressed forward.

971
00:58:47,054 --> 00:58:47,774
And those forward.

972
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:50,287
Were forced back upon
the blades behind them.

973
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:54,257
My eyes have never seen
such a storm of death.

974
00:58:54,462 --> 00:58:58,365
And now vultures circle over
Ramath-Lehi.

975
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,625
And Samson...

976
00:59:00,836 --> 00:59:05,796
In gone unto the hills.

977
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:14,571
Take this fool and tend his wounds.

978
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,460
Now where is the lord Ahtur?

979
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:28,461
I am here, mighty saran.

980
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,361
Mighty?

981
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:32,866
In what?

982
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,867
Certainly not my army.

983
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,508
Have you come to tell us
of your triumph?

984
00:59:38,709 --> 00:59:40,974
Your messenger has given us
a very thorough account.

985
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:44,410
He told us how your warrior Zamath
charged like a lion,

986
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:49,211
Only to have his skull crushed
like an egg through his helmet.

987
00:59:49,421 --> 00:59:52,584
And, uh, with what,

988
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:56,227
High prince Ahtur?

989
00:59:56,429 --> 01:00:03,926
Tell this council the weapon
used against you.

990
01:00:04,136 --> 01:00:04,864
Well?

991
01:00:05,071 --> 01:00:06,436
Tell them.

992
01:00:06,672 --> 01:00:09,572
Speak.

993
01:00:09,775 --> 01:00:13,610
The jawbone of an ass.

994
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:15,577
Lord Ahtur.

995
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:17,942
Military governor of Dan,

996
01:00:18,151 --> 01:00:20,278
Price of Philistia,

997
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,319
Hakim of armies...

998
01:00:22,522 --> 01:00:26,459
Beaten with the jawbone of an ass.

999
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:30,391
Our armies, that scattered the Hittites,

1000
01:00:30,598 --> 01:00:32,828
That swept the amortizes before them,

1001
01:00:33,034 --> 01:00:34,092
That cut through Canaan.

1002
01:00:34,302 --> 01:00:35,792
To conquer the circle of the earth,

1003
01:00:36,004 --> 01:00:39,167
Beaten with the jawbone of an ass.

1004
01:00:39,373 --> 01:00:44,836
Are you a solider
or a clown commanding fools?

1005
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:47,675
What is the number of all the forces
at our command?

1006
01:00:47,883 --> 01:00:48,473
Of chariots,

1007
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:51,446
600 heavy, 1,000 light.

1008
01:00:51,654 --> 01:00:52,154
Yes...

1009
01:00:52,187 --> 01:00:53,153
500 dromedaries of the swiftest.

1010
01:00:53,355 --> 01:00:53,855
Mm-hmm.

1011
01:00:53,922 --> 01:00:56,484
2,000 horsemen,
without the palace guard.

1012
01:00:56,726 --> 01:00:59,592
3,000 heavy armored Searmen
of the elite.

1013
01:00:59,796 --> 01:01:00,763
8,000...

1014
01:01:00,963 --> 01:01:03,932
And we're beaten by the jawbone
of an ass.

1015
01:01:04,134 --> 01:01:05,760
Am I, lord of the five cities,

1016
01:01:05,969 --> 01:01:08,437
To be laughed at before the world.

1017
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:11,300
Before my subject peoples.

1018
01:01:11,509 --> 01:01:14,171
Because a Danite herdsman
routs my armies?

1019
01:01:14,377 --> 01:01:16,209
Don't set that down, you fool.

1020
01:01:16,413 --> 01:01:18,882
Burns my crops, pillages caravans,

1021
01:01:19,082 --> 01:01:20,743
Even carries away the gates of my city!

1022
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:24,318
I requested 10,000 men
to crush these Danites forever.

1023
01:01:24,521 --> 01:01:27,515
Instead, you gave me tax collectors.

1024
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,785
Taxes delivered Samson into your hands,

1025
01:01:29,995 --> 01:01:30,289
Didn't they?

1026
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,519
You couldn't hold him.

1027
01:01:31,763 --> 01:01:33,993
This Samson has some unknown power,

1028
01:01:34,198 --> 01:01:37,133
Some secret that gives him
superhuman strength.

1029
01:01:37,336 --> 01:01:39,099
No man can stand against him.

1030
01:01:39,303 --> 01:01:45,266
Perhaps he'll fall before a woman.

1031
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,978
Even Samson's strength
must have a weakness.

1032
01:01:51,184 --> 01:01:52,616
There isn't a man in the world.

1033
01:01:52,819 --> 01:01:58,952
Who won't share his secrets
with some woman.

1034
01:01:59,158 --> 01:02:01,491
Most of us have shared
our gold with a woman.

1035
01:02:01,694 --> 01:02:03,663
Ha ha ha!

1036
01:02:03,863 --> 01:02:06,195
More men have been trapped
by smiles than by rope.

1037
01:02:06,399 --> 01:02:09,459
Yes, you tried ropes, Ahtur.

1038
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:12,765
Perhaps you should have smiled at him.

1039
01:02:12,973 --> 01:02:14,372
What is your plan, Delilah?

1040
01:02:14,575 --> 01:02:16,099
Drive a tent peg through his head.

1041
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,039
Like Jael, the Canaanite?

1042
01:02:18,245 --> 01:02:21,112
No, that was not my plan, lord Sharif.

1043
01:02:21,316 --> 01:02:23,306
Delilah, do you know a woman.

1044
01:02:23,518 --> 01:02:25,247
Who could entice this barbarian,

1045
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:26,477
This killer?

1046
01:02:26,688 --> 01:02:30,124
Yes, my lords,
I can deliver Samson to you.

1047
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:31,383
You, Delilah?

1048
01:02:31,593 --> 01:02:34,061
You capture Samson? This devil?

1049
01:02:34,263 --> 01:02:35,161
Heaven protect her.

1050
01:02:35,363 --> 01:02:37,423
A dove against a bull.

1051
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:38,395
Bring in a woman,

1052
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:40,158
And you'll bring in trouble.

1053
01:02:40,368 --> 01:02:42,303
Such devotion is very touching,

1054
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:44,439
But what would you
gain from his capture?

1055
01:02:44,608 --> 01:02:46,097
My lord's favor.

1056
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:48,242
You have that. Ls that all you want?

1057
01:02:48,444 --> 01:02:49,377
No.

1058
01:02:49,578 --> 01:02:51,409
Name your price, you shall have it.

1059
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:52,877
Perhaps some little bauble.

1060
01:02:53,082 --> 01:02:56,210
In the street of jewelers?

1061
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,082
You're very generous.

1062
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,347
Tell me, Sohrab,

1063
01:03:00,558 --> 01:03:03,220
What value did you
set upon your last caravan.

1064
01:03:03,427 --> 01:03:05,190
Samson raided near Gath?

1065
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:07,693
1,100 pieces of silver.

1066
01:03:07,899 --> 01:03:08,778
Here is the reckoning.

1067
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:11,992
Then that is my price...
1,100 pieces of silver.

1068
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:14,831
1,100? Your price is high.

1069
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,439
A pharaoh's ransom for a shepherd?

1070
01:03:17,642 --> 01:03:20,042
Betters silver than blood.

1071
01:03:20,244 --> 01:03:21,575
We'll pay it.

1072
01:03:21,779 --> 01:03:25,374
1,100 pieces of silver from each of you.

1073
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:26,915
What? What?

1074
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,643
1,100!

1075
01:03:28,887 --> 01:03:31,856
1,100?

1076
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:33,816
Stand aside, please.

1077
01:03:34,026 --> 01:03:35,118
1,100 pieces!

1078
01:03:35,327 --> 01:03:37,659
I know, but this must be recorded.

1079
01:03:37,896 --> 01:03:39,363
Silence!

1080
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,796
Calm yourselves.

1081
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:44,094
You drive a sharp bargain, Delilah.

1082
01:03:44,304 --> 01:03:47,762
From you, my lord, I ask only a promise.

1083
01:03:47,974 --> 01:03:49,965
A promise for a promise?

1084
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:51,905
What is yours?

1085
01:03:52,112 --> 01:03:56,742
To bring you Samson bound and helpless.

1086
01:03:56,951 --> 01:03:59,146
Bound by these white arms?

1087
01:03:59,353 --> 01:04:00,479
No.

1088
01:04:00,688 --> 01:04:03,418
Too high a price for me to pay.

1089
01:04:03,624 --> 01:04:06,320
My thoughts will be only of you.

1090
01:04:06,526 --> 01:04:08,358
I suggest the princess of Gaza.

1091
01:04:08,562 --> 01:04:10,757
Find some other way to capture Samson.

1092
01:04:10,965 --> 01:04:14,299
You've tried other ways.

1093
01:04:14,503 --> 01:04:16,334
When my father and sister lay dead.

1094
01:04:16,538 --> 01:04:19,974
In the ashes of our home
because of Samson,

1095
01:04:20,175 --> 01:04:22,643
He laughed at my tears.

1096
01:04:22,844 --> 01:04:25,278
You cannot refuse me, my lord.

1097
01:04:25,479 --> 01:04:27,346
What promise do you ask?

1098
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:31,042
I will learn the secret of his strength.

1099
01:04:31,254 --> 01:04:35,554
But when he stands captive
and is weak as other men,

1100
01:04:35,725 --> 01:04:39,092
No drop of his blood shall be shed.

1101
01:04:39,294 --> 01:04:42,595
No blade shall touch his skin.

1102
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,994
By the sacred pillars of the temple,

1103
01:04:44,201 --> 01:04:45,930
We demand his death!

1104
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:49,196
I want his life.

1105
01:04:49,406 --> 01:04:50,873
Chain him in the gristmill.

1106
01:04:51,074 --> 01:04:53,633
Let him grind our grain like a beast.

1107
01:04:53,844 --> 01:04:56,369
Let the people mock him
and make sport of him.

1108
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:58,343
Until he draws his breath in agony.

1109
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:01,246
And every word is a prayer for death.

1110
01:05:01,452 --> 01:05:02,749
I'll pay price.

1111
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,249
And I!

1112
01:05:04,455 --> 01:05:06,149
You'll get your silver
when we get Samson.

1113
01:05:06,357 --> 01:05:07,050
All Gaza will praise you.

1114
01:05:07,257 --> 01:05:10,488
If you succeed,
no price will be too great.

1115
01:05:10,695 --> 01:05:14,655
The council is ended.

1116
01:05:16,669 --> 01:05:18,727
Think she can do it?

1117
01:05:18,937 --> 01:05:21,906
Delilah can.

1118
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:29,711
Well, Delilah, you have your price
and your promise.

1119
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:32,383
My lord is the wisest of kings.

1120
01:05:32,586 --> 01:05:35,918
And the greatest of men.

1121
01:05:36,122 --> 01:05:39,580
As a king, I have no choice.

1122
01:05:39,793 --> 01:05:41,283
As a man, I'm letting you leave.

1123
01:05:41,493 --> 01:05:45,362
Because you want to.

1124
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:46,532
King of my love,

1125
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:50,931
I go toe destroy your enemy... and mine.

1126
01:05:51,138 --> 01:05:53,128
Delilah, Delilah...

1127
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:55,070
My love is only for you.

1128
01:05:55,275 --> 01:05:57,608
Mmm.

1129
01:05:57,812 --> 01:05:59,906
A man who could stop the heart of a lion.

1130
01:06:00,115 --> 01:06:03,642
Night stir the heart of a woman.

1131
01:06:03,818 --> 01:06:11,247
I will deliver Samson to you
before the month of harvest.

1132
01:06:38,821 --> 01:06:41,790
Tab tah azi!

1133
01:06:48,632 --> 01:06:50,964
Looks like a rich merchant.

1134
01:06:51,168 --> 01:06:58,075
Looks like a philistine plum,
ripe to pick.

1135
01:06:58,276 --> 01:06:59,140
Ride back.

1136
01:06:59,344 --> 01:07:01,006
Tell Ahtur to wait with his soldiers.

1137
01:07:01,212 --> 01:07:02,873
By the scorpion's hill.

1138
01:07:03,115 --> 01:07:04,741
I'll camp in the valley of Sorek.

1139
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:07,886
Yes, mistress.

1140
01:07:10,522 --> 01:07:15,620
They'll camp by the pool
at the temple ruins.

1141
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:18,854
Why did the soldiers leave?

1142
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:21,898
Maybe they're looking for us.

1143
01:07:22,134 --> 01:07:25,001
Jebus will run off the camels
after dark,

1144
01:07:25,204 --> 01:07:27,035
While we shear the owners.

1145
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,832
They might shear us.

1146
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:31,101
Ha ha ha.

1147
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:38,774
You worry more than my little mother.
Come on.

1148
01:08:53,565 --> 01:08:54,497
Don't cry out.

1149
01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:57,065
I won't.

1150
01:08:57,269 --> 01:09:01,229
Are you afraid?

1151
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:05,600
Of a woman?

1152
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:08,713
Yes.

1153
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:18,580
Your caravan is rich.

1154
01:09:49,425 --> 01:09:53,121
Even sparrows don't travel this far
from their trade routes.

1155
01:09:53,329 --> 01:09:55,228
Why did you?

1156
01:09:55,431 --> 01:10:01,392
The jewel box is in that silver chest.

1157
01:10:12,682 --> 01:10:14,080
There's your husband?

1158
01:10:14,317 --> 01:10:18,277
I have no husband.

1159
01:10:24,662 --> 01:10:26,253
Then call your master.

1160
01:10:26,464 --> 01:10:29,661
I have no master.

1161
01:10:29,868 --> 01:10:32,462
The table's laid for two.

1162
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,831
I'm expecting a caller.

1163
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,007
Yes?

1164
01:10:37,209 --> 01:10:38,073
Who?

1165
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:41,245
You, Samson.

1166
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,084
You know my name?

1167
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:59,288
All Gaza knows your name.

1168
01:10:59,498 --> 01:11:02,298
They don't like it, I'm told.

1169
01:11:02,502 --> 01:11:04,561
They respected it.

1170
01:11:04,772 --> 01:11:08,571
Before the mighty Samson
become a common robber.

1171
01:11:08,775 --> 01:11:14,236
And Delilah became
the great courtesan of Gaza.

1172
01:11:15,617 --> 01:11:17,641
I'm stupid, Samson,

1173
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:21,116
To think I could deceive you.

1174
01:11:21,322 --> 01:11:25,281
Steal what you like.

1175
01:11:25,593 --> 01:11:27,255
This is not stealing.

1176
01:11:27,461 --> 01:11:29,020
These are taxes.

1177
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:31,324
Your saran taxes us,

1178
01:11:31,534 --> 01:11:35,493
I tax the philistines.

1179
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:42,105
What pretty Danite girl
will wear these taxes?

1180
01:11:42,311 --> 01:11:46,271
They'll buy armor.

1181
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:51,552
They'll buy armor to protect us
from philistine spears.

1182
01:11:51,755 --> 01:11:54,417
You need protection?

1183
01:11:54,624 --> 01:11:58,116
The woman that rules
the ruler of the five cities.

1184
01:11:58,327 --> 01:12:03,288
Must have great wealth.

1185
01:12:05,402 --> 01:12:08,701
Where's the rest of it?

1186
01:12:08,905 --> 01:12:11,874
Not far away.

1187
01:12:16,348 --> 01:12:22,308
I will hide nothing from you.

1188
01:12:23,955 --> 01:12:26,924
The oldest trick in the world...

1189
01:12:27,126 --> 01:12:33,087
A silk trap baited with a woman.

1190
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:37,492
You know a better bait, Samson?

1191
01:12:37,703 --> 01:12:41,104
Men always respond.

1192
01:12:41,307 --> 01:12:43,070
Of all the women in Gaza,

1193
01:12:43,242 --> 01:12:45,403
Why did the saran send you?

1194
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:48,672
I asked to come.

1195
01:12:48,882 --> 01:12:50,042
Why?

1196
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:56,189
I knew you'd yield to any other woman.

1197
01:12:57,724 --> 01:13:00,990
And you came here to save me.

1198
01:13:01,195 --> 01:13:02,253
No.

1199
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:06,422
I came to betray you.

1200
01:13:11,472 --> 01:13:16,934
By the four winds you
have courage, Delilah.

1201
01:13:18,879 --> 01:13:20,643
Don't overlook this.

1202
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:25,252
It's a gift from the saran.

1203
01:13:25,454 --> 01:13:27,251
You could bind a man tighter.

1204
01:13:27,456 --> 01:13:30,516
Than the saran's chains.

1205
01:13:30,726 --> 01:13:33,025
Could I bind you?

1206
01:13:33,229 --> 01:13:34,253
No, Delilah.

1207
01:13:34,464 --> 01:13:36,955
You're going back to the saran.

1208
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:38,997
The only way you can be trusted.

1209
01:13:39,202 --> 01:13:45,163
Oh? Will you kill me yourself?

1210
01:13:45,742 --> 01:13:50,146
You could crush me
between these two hands.

1211
01:13:50,313 --> 01:13:53,306
Why don't you?

1212
01:13:53,617 --> 01:13:58,316
I told you once I'd kiss you
with my dying breath.

1213
01:13:58,554 --> 01:14:03,858
Your kiss has the sting of death.

1214
01:14:04,062 --> 01:14:06,724
I don't believe you could kill me.

1215
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:09,900
Try.

1216
01:14:10,535 --> 01:14:14,630
You're afraid to kill me.

1217
01:14:14,839 --> 01:14:19,300
I'll let the devil do that.

1218
01:14:19,512 --> 01:14:21,570
I know you will,

1219
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:27,742
But don't make me eat supper alone.

1220
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,089
Hisham.

1221
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,988
I'll go back to Gaza at daylight.

1222
01:14:36,196 --> 01:14:40,098
You'll leave tonight.

1223
01:14:40,299 --> 01:14:41,597
We're leaving, Hisham.

1224
01:14:41,802 --> 01:14:43,565
Have the men load the camels.

1225
01:14:43,769 --> 01:14:44,930
What camels?

1226
01:14:45,137 --> 01:14:48,870
His bandits stole your camels.

1227
01:14:49,076 --> 01:14:51,635
Then have the drivers prepare a litter.

1228
01:14:51,846 --> 01:14:53,472
You have no drivers.

1229
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,612
They ran to the hills.

1230
01:14:54,816 --> 01:14:58,343
When they saw this spawn of the devil.

1231
01:14:58,552 --> 01:15:00,679
How can I go, Samson?

1232
01:15:00,888 --> 01:15:03,357
I'll have your camels brought back.

1233
01:15:03,558 --> 01:15:06,254
Why not bring them yourself tomorrow?

1234
01:15:06,462 --> 01:15:07,861
Because when my back's turned,

1235
01:15:08,063 --> 01:15:10,690
You'll send for Ahtur's soldiers.

1236
01:15:10,898 --> 01:15:12,628
I couldn't send for anyone

1237
01:15:12,835 --> 01:15:16,794
if you were with me.

1238
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,934
Hisham, pour the wine.

1239
01:15:21,144 --> 01:15:24,307
Pour it for one,

1240
01:15:24,514 --> 01:15:27,038
Have you lost your taste for wine,
Samson?

1241
01:15:27,249 --> 01:15:29,377
I've got that I want.

1242
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:33,545
You are all I want.

1243
01:15:35,658 --> 01:15:38,627
You...

1244
01:15:39,296 --> 01:15:43,231
Daughter of hell.

1245
01:15:59,451 --> 01:16:03,114
Seven green witches for our seven days,
Samson.

1246
01:16:03,322 --> 01:16:06,154
Stop trying to be a fish!

1247
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:07,724
Let me try them on you.

1248
01:16:07,926 --> 01:16:09,918
The last people who tried
drowning Danites.

1249
01:16:10,128 --> 01:16:11,618
And up beneath the red sea.

1250
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:17,793
Oh, Samson, that water's too wet!

1251
01:16:18,005 --> 01:16:23,965
Com up here and help me with these.

1252
01:16:24,777 --> 01:16:29,976
I have my hands full with you.

1253
01:16:30,182 --> 01:16:31,878
What do you want with those
green witches?

1254
01:16:32,085 --> 01:16:33,609
Planning to snare a rabbit?

1255
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:36,789
No... a lion.

1256
01:16:37,124 --> 01:16:39,786
With those?

1257
01:16:39,994 --> 01:16:43,087
I'm weaving you a crown.

1258
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:44,662
A lion with lilies in his mane?

1259
01:16:44,865 --> 01:16:46,162
Hold these.

1260
01:16:46,366 --> 01:16:50,394
This crown will have a secret power.

1261
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:53,073
For its wearer or its weaver?

1262
01:16:53,274 --> 01:16:56,710
Only a secret can buy a secret.

1263
01:16:56,911 --> 01:16:59,345
I have no secrets left to tell.

1264
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,379
No?

1265
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:04,644
You never told me why you're stronger
than other men.

1266
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:06,946
Is it some herb you mix in your food.

1267
01:17:07,157 --> 01:17:14,529
Or some charmed oil you rub into
your body?

1268
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:15,863
What would you do

1269
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:19,627
if you knew the secret of my strength?

1270
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:22,430
Bind you.

1271
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:24,732
Why?

1272
01:17:24,941 --> 01:17:29,537
So you could never leave me.

1273
01:17:29,779 --> 01:17:30,619
I couldn't escape you

1274
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:35,243
if you bound me with these seven
green reeds.

1275
01:17:35,453 --> 01:17:39,685
Could seven little green witches hold
Samson?

1276
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:43,018
These green witches are much stronger
than they look.

1277
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:46,424
Hold them tight.

1278
01:17:46,631 --> 01:17:48,224
See?

1279
01:17:48,433 --> 01:17:50,799
If you bound me with these seven
little witches,

1280
01:17:51,003 --> 01:17:52,971
I'd be weak like any other man.

1281
01:17:53,171 --> 01:17:54,637
Truly?

1282
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,740
Try it.

1283
01:17:56,942 --> 01:18:00,469
Poor Samson, he'll be helpless,

1284
01:18:00,679 --> 01:18:01,873
Led on a leash,

1285
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,878
The slave of a woman.

1286
01:18:04,082 --> 01:18:07,519
That knot there wouldn't hold a sparrow.

1287
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,586
Tie it double.

1288
01:18:12,258 --> 01:18:17,195
Now you're my prisoner.

1289
01:18:19,266 --> 01:18:23,202
Or are you mine?

1290
01:18:33,281 --> 01:18:39,220
Samson, the philistines are upon you.

1291
01:18:41,122 --> 01:18:44,091
Aah!

1292
01:18:51,167 --> 01:18:54,728
I ought to break this over your lying
little skull.

1293
01:18:54,936 --> 01:18:59,896
But it was a philistine.

1294
01:19:00,175 --> 01:19:02,906
You could teach the devil new tricks.

1295
01:19:03,112 --> 01:19:09,018
Well, you tried to cheat me.

1296
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:32,937
Delilah...

1297
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:36,046
No, I will not listen.

1298
01:19:36,248 --> 01:19:36,838
But you asked me to...

1299
01:19:37,049 --> 01:19:39,482
I don't want to hear you.

1300
01:19:39,685 --> 01:19:42,210
Three times you plagued me to tell you.

1301
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,322
And three times you've lied to me.

1302
01:19:45,524 --> 01:19:48,220
You said new ropes that had never
been used.

1303
01:19:48,427 --> 01:19:49,861
Would hold you.

1304
01:19:50,062 --> 01:19:52,998
Who knows the strength of a rope
that's never been us.

1305
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:55,292
Then you told me your strength
would go

1306
01:19:55,502 --> 01:19:57,435
if I wove your hair to the web
of my loom.

1307
01:19:57,637 --> 01:20:00,161
Now look at my loom.

1308
01:20:00,373 --> 01:20:03,638
I'd rather look at you.

1309
01:20:03,844 --> 01:20:05,539
Oh! It's no use, Samson.

1310
01:20:05,712 --> 01:20:09,239
You'll always find a new trick to
deceive me.

1311
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:12,145
The night I came to the valley of Sorek,

1312
01:20:12,353 --> 01:20:14,877
You wanted to send me away.

1313
01:20:15,088 --> 01:20:21,029
You were right. It is better that I go.

1314
01:20:21,228 --> 01:20:24,197
Delilah.

1315
01:20:27,502 --> 01:20:30,096
Delilah...

1316
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:32,465
Once your father offered you to me
in marriage.

1317
01:20:32,674 --> 01:20:35,905
I remember what you called me.

1318
01:20:36,112 --> 01:20:39,569
Never mind what I said then.

1319
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:43,751
Will you marry me now?

1320
01:20:46,923 --> 01:20:49,586
There are too many lies between us.

1321
01:20:49,759 --> 01:20:52,455
You still fear me more than you love me.

1322
01:20:52,662 --> 01:20:57,600
I don't fear you enough.

1323
01:20:57,867 --> 01:21:01,064
You don't trust me enough.

1324
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:04,866
I love you enough.

1325
01:21:05,075 --> 01:21:07,066
Then...

1326
01:21:07,277 --> 01:21:10,940
Then tell me the secret
of your strength.

1327
01:21:11,148 --> 01:21:14,117
My strength?

1328
01:21:18,155 --> 01:21:18,836
My strength is...

1329
01:21:18,856 --> 01:21:21,291
No, Samson, no!

1330
01:21:21,492 --> 01:21:28,422
I don't want to be armed with a
weapon to destroy you.

1331
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:29,259
Weapon?

1332
01:21:35,674 --> 01:21:38,610
It wouldn't be a weapon
if you really loved me.

1333
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:41,405
Oh, Samson, Samson.

1334
01:21:41,615 --> 01:21:46,779
How can there be nay doubt left in you?

1335
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:52,949
If there is, I'll end it now.

1336
01:21:53,627 --> 01:21:58,564
Look about you, Delilah.

1337
01:21:59,266 --> 01:22:03,726
The moon that lights this oasis by
night...

1338
01:22:03,937 --> 01:22:05,338
And the sun that lights it by day.

1339
01:22:05,539 --> 01:22:08,906
Are not there by chance.

1340
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:11,635
In the beginning,
there was only darkness,

1341
01:22:11,846 --> 01:22:14,610
Until one power created light.

1342
01:22:14,816 --> 01:22:17,409
And shaped the earth and
all the things that live upo.

1343
01:22:17,618 --> 01:22:20,020
Your invisible god.

1344
01:22:20,222 --> 01:22:22,213
My strength comes from him.

1345
01:22:22,424 --> 01:22:25,552
But how does his power reach you?

1346
01:22:25,761 --> 01:22:28,594
Is he here with us now?

1347
01:22:28,797 --> 01:22:31,061
He's everywhere.

1348
01:22:31,266 --> 01:22:36,295
In the wind, in the sea, in the fire.

1349
01:22:36,506 --> 01:22:40,442
In your heart if you believe in him.

1350
01:22:40,643 --> 01:22:43,168
His is the only power in the world.

1351
01:22:43,379 --> 01:22:45,574
That can break open a seed.

1352
01:22:45,782 --> 01:22:51,346
And raise it into that great tree.

1353
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:55,491
And can I share this power with you?

1354
01:22:55,693 --> 01:22:59,060
Anyone can share it.

1355
01:22:59,263 --> 01:23:04,895
It's a gift that makes men
greater than themselves.

1356
01:23:05,136 --> 01:23:09,732
With it, some can stir the
soul with music.

1357
01:23:09,908 --> 01:23:15,540
Others can read the truth
in men's hearts and forgive.

1358
01:23:15,747 --> 01:23:18,306
To me, it's the strength
to break any bonds.

1359
01:23:18,516 --> 01:23:20,040
That can be put upon me.

1360
01:23:20,252 --> 01:23:22,618
Will you always have this strength?

1361
01:23:22,822 --> 01:23:25,689
As long as I keep faith
with the almighty.

1362
01:23:25,891 --> 01:23:30,191
A long time ago, I was dedicated to him.

1363
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:32,921
Many of the vows I've broken,

1364
01:23:33,165 --> 01:23:35,156
But one I've kept.

1365
01:23:35,369 --> 01:23:37,666
A vow has made you strong?

1366
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:43,002
Oh, it's much more than that.

1367
01:23:43,209 --> 01:23:46,043
Do you remember the lion I killed?

1368
01:23:46,245 --> 01:23:48,907
I'll never forget.

1369
01:23:49,116 --> 01:23:52,678
The strength of the lion makes
him king of beasts.

1370
01:23:52,887 --> 01:23:54,718
The great ruff of his mane

1371
01:23:54,921 --> 01:23:57,082
ls the mark of his power.

1372
01:23:57,291 --> 01:23:59,155
Go on, Samson.

1373
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,080
Men of the desert.

1374
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:03,027
Know that the long flowing mane
of the stallion

1375
01:24:03,231 --> 01:24:06,759
ls the mark of his power.

1376
01:24:06,968 --> 01:24:08,834
Among my people,

1377
01:24:09,037 --> 01:24:13,634
They say that the strongest ram
has the heaviest wool.

1378
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:16,276
But clip the mark of his power...

1379
01:24:16,477 --> 01:24:19,709
Shear him, and he becomes a thing
to laugh at.

1380
01:24:19,914 --> 01:24:23,682
The shield of his strength is gone.

1381
01:24:23,887 --> 01:24:26,981
You've seen the eagle climb the sky.

1382
01:24:27,189 --> 01:24:28,885
But pluck the two prime feathers.

1383
01:24:29,092 --> 01:24:31,356
From the tip of one wing,

1384
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,291
And the mighty eagle can no longer fly.

1385
01:24:34,496 --> 01:24:38,229
The mark of his power is gone.

1386
01:24:38,435 --> 01:24:42,371
The mark of his power.

1387
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,609
Samson.

1388
01:24:46,242 --> 01:24:49,268
This is the mark of your power.

1389
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,004
It's your hair.

1390
01:24:51,248 --> 01:24:55,150
If it were shorn from your head...

1391
01:24:55,353 --> 01:24:58,378
I'd be as weak as any other man.

1392
01:24:58,589 --> 01:25:01,080
You believe that this great god of yours.

1393
01:25:01,292 --> 01:25:04,659
Has given you your power through
your hair?

1394
01:25:04,863 --> 01:25:07,992
You do believe that, don't you?

1395
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,533
From the beginning, my mother
taught me so.

1396
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:14,535
Your power is in your hair.

1397
01:25:14,739 --> 01:25:18,573
What a beautiful power it is.

1398
01:25:18,778 --> 01:25:21,907
Look how it curls around my finger.

1399
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:25,050
Black as a raven's wing.

1400
01:25:25,252 --> 01:25:28,880
And wild as a storm.

1401
01:25:29,056 --> 01:25:34,049
Shall I pull it out and steal your
power?

1402
01:25:34,261 --> 01:25:35,888
You cannot steal...

1403
01:25:36,063 --> 01:25:40,056
What's yours already.

1404
01:25:42,536 --> 01:25:44,732
Come with me to Egypt.

1405
01:25:44,938 --> 01:25:47,635
We'll not be Danite and philistine
there.

1406
01:25:47,841 --> 01:25:51,243
Only Samson and Delilah.

1407
01:25:51,447 --> 01:25:52,640
In the valley of the Nile,

1408
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:55,372
The air will be sweet with myrrh,

1409
01:25:55,583 --> 01:26:00,748
And only the flight of the ibis
will darken the sky.

1410
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:03,947
Will you come with me?

1411
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:08,256
My eyes could never find more beauty.

1412
01:26:08,464 --> 01:26:11,923
Than they see in you.

1413
01:26:12,169 --> 01:26:13,294
Through all eternity,

1414
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:19,463
Nothing can ever take you out of
my arms.

1415
01:26:25,116 --> 01:26:28,107
Samson.

1416
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:31,988
Miriam.

1417
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:34,452
Saul.

1418
01:26:34,658 --> 01:26:36,821
Miriam, you bring bad news?

1419
01:26:37,028 --> 01:26:38,893
Let me talk with you alone.

1420
01:26:39,096 --> 01:26:40,724
Saul, fill the water bottle.

1421
01:26:40,932 --> 01:26:43,901
In the tent.

1422
01:26:58,584 --> 01:27:00,279
How did you leave my mother?

1423
01:27:00,485 --> 01:27:03,511
Chained to a post and whipped.

1424
01:27:03,722 --> 01:27:07,659
Philistine swine.

1425
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:10,226
Here.

1426
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,658
My father?

1427
01:27:11,864 --> 01:27:14,833
Stoned.

1428
01:27:17,503 --> 01:27:20,370
They are killing and burning
in every village.

1429
01:27:20,573 --> 01:27:21,836
The firstborn in every home

1430
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:23,839
ls put to the sword.

1431
01:27:24,044 --> 01:27:25,272
While this woman of Sorek.

1432
01:27:25,478 --> 01:27:26,759
Makes you drunk with her kisses,

1433
01:27:26,779 --> 01:27:30,511
The philistines murder your people.

1434
01:27:30,718 --> 01:27:33,811
You are falling into Ahtur's net,
Samson.

1435
01:27:34,021 --> 01:27:35,716
The philistines strike against
your people.

1436
01:27:35,923 --> 01:27:36,446
To get you.

1437
01:27:36,658 --> 01:27:40,754
Your mother cries your name, Samson.

1438
01:27:40,962 --> 01:27:41,860
We'll go.

1439
01:27:42,063 --> 01:27:43,502
I'll saddle a beast for you to ride.

1440
01:27:43,698 --> 01:27:45,529
Don't go, Samson.

1441
01:27:45,733 --> 01:27:47,827
This milk-faced girl with her cow's eyes.

1442
01:27:48,036 --> 01:27:53,976
Will lead you to your death.

1443
01:27:55,378 --> 01:27:57,038
You love him.

1444
01:27:57,213 --> 01:27:59,443
Women cannot deceive each other.

1445
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,981
It is in your face when you look at him.

1446
01:28:02,184 --> 01:28:07,417
You want him for yourself.

1447
01:28:07,624 --> 01:28:10,092
Yes, I love him.

1448
01:28:10,293 --> 01:28:14,025
In his face, I see all that is
strong and good.

1449
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:19,225
His name is like a cry of hope for us.

1450
01:28:19,469 --> 01:28:23,907
I've dreamed that someday Samson
would take me for hi.

1451
01:28:24,107 --> 01:28:26,633
But he's never looked upon me as a
woman.

1452
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:29,369
His face... his name...

1453
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,103
Shadows on the wall.

1454
01:28:31,316 --> 01:28:33,340
You think that is love?

1455
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:36,520
You worship him with prayers and
downcast eyes.

1456
01:28:36,754 --> 01:28:41,054
I love him as a man of flesh and blood.

1457
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:45,696
He is not leaving you for me.

1458
01:28:45,898 --> 01:28:47,778
There is a higher voice that speaks
through him,

1459
01:28:47,933 --> 01:28:50,560
And he will always answer its call.

1460
01:28:50,769 --> 01:28:54,865
Even your treacherous beauty cannot
turn him from it.

1461
01:28:55,075 --> 01:28:57,804
I cannot fight against his god...

1462
01:28:58,011 --> 01:29:03,278
But no woman will take him from me.

1463
01:29:03,516 --> 01:29:06,484
Miriam.

1464
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:17,030
Hisham!

1465
01:29:18,064 --> 01:29:21,033
Hisham.

1466
01:30:01,077 --> 01:30:03,546
Hisham.

1467
01:30:03,746 --> 01:30:06,715
Play music.

1468
01:30:07,618 --> 01:30:08,313
Water bottles filled?

1469
01:30:08,452 --> 01:30:09,077
Yes, Samson.

1470
01:30:09,286 --> 01:30:09,786
Come on.

1471
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:12,687
Samson.

1472
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:15,415
Samson, don't turn back.

1473
01:30:15,627 --> 01:30:17,150
Samson.

1474
01:30:17,362 --> 01:30:19,886
Go on with Saul. I'll overtake you.

1475
01:30:20,097 --> 01:30:23,067
Aw, Samson.

1476
01:30:30,242 --> 01:30:31,333
Don't worry, Miriam.

1477
01:30:31,544 --> 01:30:35,480
He'll keep his word.

1478
01:30:38,819 --> 01:30:40,445
You called?

1479
01:30:40,653 --> 01:30:43,554
The wine of parting is bitter, Samson.

1480
01:30:43,756 --> 01:30:45,485
Not as bitter as blood.

1481
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,159
You cannot wipe away such love as
I have given you.

1482
01:30:48,394 --> 01:30:50,760
Without even a farewell.

1483
01:30:50,964 --> 01:30:54,195
I have a new debt to pay the
philistines.

1484
01:30:54,402 --> 01:30:55,642
Then I'll come to you in Egypt.

1485
01:30:55,769 --> 01:31:00,070
No, Samson. I've lost you.

1486
01:31:00,273 --> 01:31:04,209
Drain this cup...

1487
01:31:06,947 --> 01:31:12,853
As you have drained my heart.

1488
01:31:35,544 --> 01:31:38,412
You always doubt me, don't you?

1489
01:31:38,615 --> 01:31:42,551
And always love you.

1490
01:31:48,858 --> 01:31:52,294
I'll find you, Delilah, wherever you go.

1491
01:31:52,462 --> 01:31:53,828
No, Samson.

1492
01:31:54,031 --> 01:31:55,589
You belong to Miriam.

1493
01:31:55,799 --> 01:31:57,824
She's the good in you.

1494
01:31:58,035 --> 01:31:59,696
I'm the weakness...

1495
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:05,603
The love that would enslave you.

1496
01:32:05,809 --> 01:32:11,715
I'll never be free of you, Delilah.

1497
01:32:18,723 --> 01:32:22,852
Let me feel the strength of your
arms about me.

1498
01:32:23,061 --> 01:32:26,793
When you are gone,
my arms will be empty.

1499
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:31,936
My world will be empty.

1500
01:32:48,789 --> 01:32:52,225
Tell lord Ahtur's messenger...

1501
01:32:52,426 --> 01:32:56,363
I have the secret.

1502
01:33:54,326 --> 01:33:55,587
Samson.

1503
01:33:55,826 --> 01:33:58,522
Samson, the philistines are upon you.

1504
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:00,095
I'll go out against them.

1505
01:34:00,297 --> 01:34:02,857
I'll...

1506
01:34:03,068 --> 01:34:04,534
Look at his hair, captain.

1507
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:06,430
The lion of Dan is shorn like a sheep,

1508
01:34:06,604 --> 01:34:08,732
The lion? Without a mane?

1509
01:34:08,939 --> 01:34:10,408
Clean as a new-mown field.

1510
01:34:10,609 --> 01:34:14,341
She must've used a sickle on him.

1511
01:34:14,546 --> 01:34:16,014
Delilah plucked him like a chicken.

1512
01:34:16,248 --> 01:34:19,809
I've taken away your strength, Samson.

1513
01:34:20,018 --> 01:34:24,684
Your little Danite sparrow
will nest alone.

1514
01:34:24,891 --> 01:34:28,258
You philistine gutter rat.

1515
01:34:28,462 --> 01:34:28,962
Hey. Hey.

1516
01:34:29,062 --> 01:34:30,962
Throw your spears.

1517
01:34:31,164 --> 01:34:34,999
The shield of my god is gone from me.

1518
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:37,500
What do you fear?

1519
01:34:37,704 --> 01:34:41,141
My blood will flow as red as yours.

1520
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:42,707
All Gaza will honor the man.

1521
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,400
Who brings back my head.

1522
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:46,909
We won't kill you.

1523
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:48,945
You Danites need a living reminder.

1524
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:50,616
Of the price of revolt.

1525
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,820
Bind him.

1526
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:57,857
Call on your god, Samson.

1527
01:34:58,059 --> 01:35:00,152
I've betrayed him.

1528
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:02,329
He would not hear me.

1529
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:05,500
Are you not stronger than a hundred men?

1530
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:08,569
You cannot carry away the gates of
Gaza again.

1531
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:10,399
You cannot kill a lion now.

1532
01:35:10,606 --> 01:35:13,097
You're weak as any other man.

1533
01:35:13,343 --> 01:35:19,281
Stand him against that pole.

1534
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:24,278
Hisham, we leave for Gaza.

1535
01:35:24,488 --> 01:35:26,581
You've done well, Delilah.

1536
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:28,758
No blade shall touch his skin.

1537
01:35:28,959 --> 01:35:30,950
No drop of his blood shall be shed.

1538
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:33,959
Courier. Take word to the lord of
the five cities.

1539
01:35:34,164 --> 01:35:35,654
That Delilah has kept her bargain.

1540
01:35:35,899 --> 01:35:37,366
Yes, my lord,

1541
01:35:37,601 --> 01:35:41,038
The princes of Gaza will keep theirs.

1542
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:43,071
You shall have your payment.

1543
01:35:43,274 --> 01:35:45,243
Payment.

1544
01:35:45,443 --> 01:35:47,969
Your arms were quicksand.

1545
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:50,647
Your kiss was death.

1546
01:35:50,849 --> 01:35:53,146
The name Delilah will be an
everlasting curse.

1547
01:35:53,351 --> 01:35:54,682
On the lips of men.

1548
01:35:54,886 --> 01:35:57,856
Bah.

1549
01:36:02,294 --> 01:36:04,262
I could have love you with a fire.

1550
01:36:04,463 --> 01:36:07,262
To make all other loves seem like ice.

1551
01:36:07,466 --> 01:36:09,229
I would have gone with you to Egypt,

1552
01:36:09,434 --> 01:36:10,733
Left everything behind,

1553
01:36:10,937 --> 01:36:13,337
Lived only for you.

1554
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:17,704
But one call from the milk-faced
Danite lily,

1555
01:36:17,911 --> 01:36:23,349
And you run whining at her heels.

1556
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:27,487
No man leaves Delilah.

1557
01:36:31,058 --> 01:36:32,389
Look at her, Samson.

1558
01:36:32,593 --> 01:36:36,495
Look well and remember the perfume
of her hair,

1559
01:36:36,697 --> 01:36:38,562
The softness of her lips,

1560
01:36:38,766 --> 01:36:41,235
The fire of her embrace.

1561
01:36:41,469 --> 01:36:45,633
Satan himself taught her all the arts
of deception.

1562
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:47,307
It's easier to catch the moonlight.

1563
01:36:47,509 --> 01:36:53,448
Than to hold such a woman.

1564
01:36:53,949 --> 01:36:57,044
With all your strength,
you're a fool, Samson.

1565
01:36:57,253 --> 01:36:59,346
You trusted Delilah.

1566
01:36:59,555 --> 01:37:01,147
Remember her beauty.

1567
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:04,053
And never forget her treachery.

1568
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:07,229
Burn her image into your memory, Samson.

1569
01:37:07,463 --> 01:37:13,334
She's the last thing you'll ever see.

1570
01:37:13,537 --> 01:37:19,476
Bind his head to the pole.

1571
01:37:24,147 --> 01:37:25,808
Set it here.

1572
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:29,315
If you cannot see us,
you cannot harm us.

1573
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,114
If I have no strength to fight you,

1574
01:37:32,323 --> 01:37:38,262
I will need no eyes to find you.

1575
01:37:52,678 --> 01:37:54,144
O lord...

1576
01:37:54,346 --> 01:37:56,815
My eyes did turn away from you.

1577
01:37:57,017 --> 01:38:00,350
To look upon the flesh pots of
my enemies.

1578
01:38:00,552 --> 01:38:02,953
Now you take away my sight.

1579
01:38:03,155 --> 01:38:06,990
That I may see again more clearly.

1580
01:38:07,193 --> 01:38:13,098
Blessed be the name of the lord.

1581
01:38:14,168 --> 01:38:20,107
Don't let the blade touch his skin.

1582
01:38:40,661 --> 01:38:41,754
1,100.

1583
01:38:41,964 --> 01:38:44,832
1,100 pieces of silver and my gratitude.

1584
01:38:45,033 --> 01:38:47,468
You gratitude matches your generosity.

1585
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:49,262
Thank you.
The blessing of Dagon.

1586
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,905
I hope the count is correct.

1587
01:38:51,106 --> 01:38:54,075
Oh, it is, it is.

1588
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:55,989
If you still have the same shears,
Delilah,

1589
01:38:56,179 --> 01:38:58,740
My hair's rather long.

1590
01:38:58,916 --> 01:39:06,378
Sometime you might bait a trap for me,
Delilah.

1591
01:39:08,092 --> 01:39:11,186
Can you believe Samson's strength was
in his hair?

1592
01:39:11,395 --> 01:39:16,094
Wherever it was, he hasn't got it now.

1593
01:39:16,301 --> 01:39:18,666
Virtue is not often so well rewarded.

1594
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:23,637
Hmm. My greatest reward was in serving
my king.

1595
01:39:23,841 --> 01:39:26,811
While you were learning the secret of
Samson's streng.

1596
01:39:27,046 --> 01:39:29,605
Did he perhaps learn the secret of
your love?

1597
01:39:29,814 --> 01:39:33,750
Would I have betrayed him then?

1598
01:39:33,953 --> 01:39:37,353
Men have been betrayed by love.

1599
01:39:37,555 --> 01:39:41,789
Love and hate are but two sides of
the same coin.

1600
01:39:41,961 --> 01:39:44,657
My thoughts were only of you.

1601
01:39:44,864 --> 01:39:49,598
No man with eyes could
resist you, Delilah.

1602
01:39:49,802 --> 01:39:52,498
But only a fool would trust you.

1603
01:39:52,705 --> 01:39:54,263
Why should you doubt me?

1604
01:39:54,473 --> 01:39:57,740
You've not seen Samson grinding
at the millstone?

1605
01:39:57,944 --> 01:40:00,311
No.

1606
01:40:00,514 --> 01:40:03,746
Then come to the prison house.

1607
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:06,919
No.

1608
01:40:07,954 --> 01:40:11,412
Suppose we go together.

1609
01:40:11,659 --> 01:40:17,598
Garmiskar will guard your fortune.

1610
01:40:32,981 --> 01:40:36,918
Come on, come on!

1611
01:41:17,529 --> 01:41:20,623
Grindstone for you.
He's milling flour for her.

1612
01:41:20,832 --> 01:41:22,231
And for the lion killer,

1613
01:41:22,434 --> 01:41:24,732
Delilah's put a millstone
around his neck.

1614
01:41:24,936 --> 01:41:25,493
Grind his body with the grain!

1615
01:41:25,704 --> 01:41:27,229
Beat him with the jawbone of an ass!

1616
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,809
He burned our crops! Hang him!

1617
01:41:32,011 --> 01:41:36,948
Behold the lion of Dan!

1618
01:41:37,716 --> 01:41:41,084
He's magnificent, even in chains.

1619
01:41:41,287 --> 01:41:43,085
Bend your back, you two-legged mule!

1620
01:41:43,289 --> 01:41:44,279
Make him sweat!

1621
01:41:44,525 --> 01:41:47,085
Break those chains, Danite!

1622
01:41:47,294 --> 01:41:49,558
Samson was tamed by a woman.

1623
01:41:49,762 --> 01:41:52,755
And probably worth it.

1624
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,661
He sit looks strong as an ox.

1625
01:41:54,868 --> 01:41:56,836
He'd look a whole lot stronger

1626
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:59,437
if he hadn't met Delilah.

1627
01:41:59,641 --> 01:42:05,170
By their yelps, you'd think
the felled the lion.

1628
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:08,679
He has not dared to look at me.

1629
01:42:08,883 --> 01:42:12,215
He cannot see you.

1630
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:16,357
I'll make him see me.

1631
01:42:53,264 --> 01:42:56,232
He's blind.

1632
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:01,696
He can never see me again.

1633
01:43:01,907 --> 01:43:03,533
Does that disturb you?

1634
01:43:03,742 --> 01:43:06,175
I had your promise.

1635
01:43:06,378 --> 01:43:08,346
No blade has touched his skin.

1636
01:43:08,513 --> 01:43:10,070
No drop of his blood was shed.

1637
01:43:10,282 --> 01:43:14,685
You... you played with words
to rob him of his eyes.

1638
01:43:14,887 --> 01:43:19,118
It was you who betrayed him, not I.

1639
01:43:19,325 --> 01:43:22,623
He was captive, in chains,

1640
01:43:22,828 --> 01:43:24,193
Yet the lord of the five cities.

1641
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:26,761
Could not show him mercy?

1642
01:43:26,966 --> 01:43:30,926
Did you show him mercy, Delilah?

1643
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:34,937
You wanted vengeance.

1644
01:43:35,142 --> 01:43:38,110
You have it.

1645
01:43:38,612 --> 01:43:41,581
Majesty.

1646
01:43:48,089 --> 01:43:51,148
Your enemies fall at your feet.

1647
01:43:51,358 --> 01:43:54,327
Get up!

1648
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:01,668
Oh, let me leave!

1649
01:44:04,806 --> 01:44:07,537
Water.

1650
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:09,711
Water.

1651
01:44:09,944 --> 01:44:12,412
Here's your water.

1652
01:44:12,614 --> 01:44:13,479
Beg for it.

1653
01:44:13,683 --> 01:44:14,843
Thirsty, Samson?

1654
01:44:15,051 --> 01:44:18,987
Let him drink from a trough!

1655
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:20,121
Water.

1656
01:44:20,323 --> 01:44:26,262
Here's drink for a jackass.

1657
01:44:26,563 --> 01:44:29,533
How did you lose your hair, Samson?

1658
01:44:29,766 --> 01:44:31,256
Water.

1659
01:44:31,501 --> 01:44:33,902
Lap it up.

1660
01:44:34,104 --> 01:44:38,040
Now, turn that wheel.

1661
01:44:38,675 --> 01:44:41,736
I will not see him thirst.

1662
01:44:41,945 --> 01:44:45,883
Give him water.

1663
01:44:46,819 --> 01:44:48,012
There can be only one master.

1664
01:44:48,219 --> 01:44:50,619
In a kingdom or a woman's heart.

1665
01:44:50,822 --> 01:44:52,791
Until you saw him like this,

1666
01:44:53,024 --> 01:44:54,924
You could not forget him.

1667
01:44:55,126 --> 01:44:58,095
Forget him?

1668
01:44:58,664 --> 01:44:59,825
Here's your water.

1669
01:45:00,032 --> 01:45:01,557
Every cup of water,

1670
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,097
Every morsel of food,

1671
01:45:03,302 --> 01:45:05,964
Must be guided into his hands.

1672
01:45:06,172 --> 01:45:08,469
The mighty Samson, betrayed by a woman.

1673
01:45:08,607 --> 01:45:09,369
No.

1674
01:45:09,575 --> 01:45:11,907
Blinded, ridiculed, pitied.

1675
01:45:12,111 --> 01:45:15,240
No, I did not blind him!

1676
01:45:15,448 --> 01:45:16,809
Are you going to be as big a fool.

1677
01:45:16,951 --> 01:45:18,542
As you've made of him?

1678
01:45:18,752 --> 01:45:21,722
He'd kill you.

1679
01:45:30,298 --> 01:45:36,236
You cannot undo what has been done.

1680
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:22,519
You cannot undo what has been done.

1681
01:46:30,762 --> 01:46:33,230
My eyes could never find more beauty.

1682
01:46:33,465 --> 01:46:36,559
Than they see in you.

1683
01:46:36,768 --> 01:46:39,498
You cannot undo what has been done.

1684
01:46:39,704 --> 01:46:42,673
I can! I can!

1685
01:46:48,647 --> 01:46:50,615
Round and round,

1686
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:53,318
Day after day,

1687
01:46:53,518 --> 01:46:55,146
Month after month.

1688
01:46:55,354 --> 01:46:59,051
He never stops!

1689
01:46:59,258 --> 01:47:06,688
I'm being crushed like the grain
beneath the stone.

1690
01:47:09,302 --> 01:47:13,739
This night must end sometime.

1691
01:47:13,974 --> 01:47:18,912
O god of Samson, help me.

1692
01:47:29,624 --> 01:47:32,093
He said you are everywhere.

1693
01:47:32,326 --> 01:47:34,590
That you are almighty.

1694
01:47:34,796 --> 01:47:36,820
Hear me.

1695
01:47:37,031 --> 01:47:40,024
Give back the light to his eyes.

1696
01:47:40,269 --> 01:47:42,862
Take my sight for his.

1697
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:46,507
O god of Samson...

1698
01:47:46,743 --> 01:47:49,712
Help me.

1699
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:03,990
Last watch of the night.

1700
01:48:04,193 --> 01:48:05,683
All's quiet within the city gates.

1701
01:48:05,929 --> 01:48:11,835
Samson lies chained in the prison house.

1702
01:48:19,276 --> 01:48:23,145
How long will your forget me, o lord?

1703
01:48:23,348 --> 01:48:27,785
How long will your hand be
set against me?

1704
01:48:28,018 --> 01:48:30,487
I call out through the long nights,

1705
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:34,887
But you do not hear me.

1706
01:48:35,094 --> 01:48:38,358
O lord, god of my fathers,

1707
01:48:38,531 --> 01:48:40,964
They called unto you and were delivered.

1708
01:48:41,167 --> 01:48:43,999
Do not forsake me, o lord.

1709
01:48:44,203 --> 01:48:47,537
Hisham, wait outside with the guard.

1710
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:49,173
Let no one come in.

1711
01:48:49,376 --> 01:48:51,071
Don't go near him, mistress.

1712
01:48:51,277 --> 01:48:52,438
He'll tear you to pieces.

1713
01:48:52,645 --> 01:48:58,584
O lord, god of my fathers...

1714
01:49:00,287 --> 01:49:05,156
O lord, I'm despised by all men.

1715
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:07,555
They mock me,

1716
01:49:07,795 --> 01:49:11,731
Saying, "he trust his god
to deliver him."

1717
01:49:11,932 --> 01:49:15,026
You are my god.

1718
01:49:15,236 --> 01:49:17,704
Be not far from me,

1719
01:49:17,905 --> 01:49:22,001
For there is no other help.

1720
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:25,771
My strength has melted like wax.

1721
01:49:25,981 --> 01:49:28,677
My heart is dry of hope.

1722
01:49:28,883 --> 01:49:31,352
I'm blinded and among enemies.

1723
01:49:31,554 --> 01:49:35,490
O lord, o my strength,

1724
01:49:35,758 --> 01:49:39,694
Send me your sign.

1725
01:49:45,401 --> 01:49:46,528
Are you flesh and blood,

1726
01:49:46,736 --> 01:49:49,068
Or an angel of the lord?

1727
01:49:49,273 --> 01:49:50,705
Who are you?

1728
01:49:50,907 --> 01:49:54,844
I heard your prayer.

1729
01:49:55,478 --> 01:49:56,945
I prayed for the lord's angel,

1730
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:58,221
And the devil sent me you.

1731
01:49:58,415 --> 01:50:00,885
All I want is to comfort you.

1732
01:50:01,085 --> 01:50:02,552
Let me come near you.

1733
01:50:02,753 --> 01:50:05,153
You were near in the valley of Sorek,

1734
01:50:05,356 --> 01:50:07,756
Trading my love for philistine silver.

1735
01:50:07,958 --> 01:50:10,893
I'd give my life to undo what I've done.

1736
01:50:11,095 --> 01:50:14,690
I believed you once. You sold my sight.

1737
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:17,368
I would endure your hatred, Samson,

1738
01:50:17,602 --> 01:50:20,367
if it would bring back your sight.

1739
01:50:20,572 --> 01:50:22,473
Let me be your eyes.

1740
01:50:22,641 --> 01:50:26,133
Through my eyes, you will see again.

1741
01:50:26,378 --> 01:50:28,107
Through all the long darkness,

1742
01:50:28,313 --> 01:50:31,442
I prayed you'd be delivered
into my hands.

1743
01:50:31,651 --> 01:50:33,482
I'm here.

1744
01:50:33,654 --> 01:50:36,554
I will not cry out.

1745
01:50:36,756 --> 01:50:39,919
God has not forsaken me.

1746
01:50:40,126 --> 01:50:43,459
His will be done.

1747
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:45,187
Samson! Samson!

1748
01:50:45,431 --> 01:50:46,865
Your chains...

1749
01:50:47,067 --> 01:50:51,003
They're broken.

1750
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:04,819
Merciful god.

1751
01:51:05,286 --> 01:51:07,652
Your strength has come back.

1752
01:51:07,856 --> 01:51:10,848
Your god has answered you.

1753
01:51:11,092 --> 01:51:13,583
He's heard my voice in the darkness.

1754
01:51:13,828 --> 01:51:15,762
He's made you free.

1755
01:51:15,964 --> 01:51:18,627
No chains can bind you again.

1756
01:51:18,834 --> 01:51:22,065
Hisham will find the swiftest
camels in Gaza.

1757
01:51:22,271 --> 01:51:25,172
My silver will open the gates
that bar your way.

1758
01:51:25,373 --> 01:51:27,706
Tonight we'll be in the land
of the pharaohs.

1759
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:30,572
The almighty didn't return my strength.

1760
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:32,339
To run from my enemies.

1761
01:51:32,582 --> 01:51:35,415
You cannot fight what you cannot see.

1762
01:51:35,619 --> 01:51:37,985
I'll go out against them as I did
before.

1763
01:51:38,188 --> 01:51:39,951
A hundred spears will cut you down.

1764
01:51:40,157 --> 01:51:46,095
Before you reach the gate.

1765
01:51:50,601 --> 01:51:52,693
I would hunt down their king.

1766
01:51:52,904 --> 01:51:54,997
When I cannot even find the door.

1767
01:51:55,206 --> 01:51:59,039
Let me be the lamp that guides
you in the night.

1768
01:51:59,243 --> 01:52:01,301
O lord, my god,

1769
01:52:01,513 --> 01:52:03,879
Show me the way wherein to walk.

1770
01:52:04,082 --> 01:52:05,709
Show me the thing I must do.

1771
01:52:05,917 --> 01:52:09,512
In the valley of the Nile,
we'll be safe.

1772
01:52:09,721 --> 01:52:11,348
We'll be together.

1773
01:52:11,556 --> 01:52:13,548
O judge of the earth,

1774
01:52:13,759 --> 01:52:15,750
Do not let me forgive her.

1775
01:52:15,994 --> 01:52:18,087
My arms will hold you again.

1776
01:52:18,298 --> 01:52:21,893
And put the food in my mouth?

1777
01:52:22,101 --> 01:52:22,429
When your heart is light,

1778
01:52:22,635 --> 01:52:24,659
I'll share your laughter.

1779
01:52:24,903 --> 01:52:28,304
When you despair, my eyes will
shed your tears.

1780
01:52:28,508 --> 01:52:30,703
When I curse you for my darkness?

1781
01:52:30,909 --> 01:52:34,312
I will kneel and ask your forgiveness.

1782
01:52:34,515 --> 01:52:36,449
Vengeance is yours, o lord.

1783
01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:38,083
Strike her.

1784
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:40,548
Destroy her...

1785
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:42,311
For I cannot.

1786
01:52:42,555 --> 01:52:45,047
My love, my love.

1787
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:47,852
Delilah.

1788
01:52:48,063 --> 01:52:50,122
Delilah.

1789
01:52:50,331 --> 01:52:52,926
When my eyes could see, I was blind.

1790
01:52:53,134 --> 01:52:56,103
Oh, Samson.

1791
01:52:57,339 --> 01:52:58,738
We must hurry.

1792
01:52:58,939 --> 01:53:01,408
They're coming to take you to the
temple.

1793
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:03,101
The temple? Is it today?

1794
01:53:03,345 --> 01:53:06,179
Yes. In a few hours,
they'll come for you.

1795
01:53:06,381 --> 01:53:07,747
All Gaza will be there.

1796
01:53:07,949 --> 01:53:09,416
Thousands of people.

1797
01:53:09,651 --> 01:53:11,175
Mind the steps.

1798
01:53:11,419 --> 01:53:14,582
The great idol Dagon will be
a fiery furnace.

1799
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:16,654
They'll humble you before him.

1800
01:53:16,826 --> 01:53:19,226
They'll bind you between the
two sacred columns.

1801
01:53:19,429 --> 01:53:21,294
And scourge you.

1802
01:53:21,498 --> 01:53:24,466
Two columns?

1803
01:53:24,934 --> 01:53:27,596
Does the house of the temple
stand on two columns?

1804
01:53:27,803 --> 01:53:28,998
Oh, hurry, Samson.

1805
01:53:29,205 --> 01:53:32,039
Egypt has a thousand temples,
each more beautiful...

1806
01:53:32,242 --> 01:53:34,836
Two columns so close

1807
01:53:35,046 --> 01:53:36,478
I may be bound between them?

1808
01:53:36,681 --> 01:53:38,512
Yes, and scourged.

1809
01:53:38,715 --> 01:53:41,149
By midday, we'll be at the
spring of Yumis.

1810
01:53:41,352 --> 01:53:43,751
With Egypt almost in sight.

1811
01:53:43,955 --> 01:53:48,654
I will stay here, Delilah.

1812
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:49,792
They'll drag you down,

1813
01:53:49,995 --> 01:53:52,293
Make you kneel before their idol.

1814
01:53:52,497 --> 01:53:56,433
Oh, Samson, why?

1815
01:53:58,136 --> 01:54:00,832
The power of the lord is in my strength.

1816
01:54:01,039 --> 01:54:06,979
Do not enter their temple today.

1817
01:55:31,402 --> 01:55:34,702
Miriam, look. It's their god Dagon.

1818
01:55:34,906 --> 01:55:36,464
W shouldn't look at him.

1819
01:55:36,708 --> 01:55:42,647
We came to see their king,
not their idol.

1820
01:55:45,683 --> 01:55:46,911
Delilah! Delilah!

1821
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:48,609
Delilah! Delilah!

1822
01:55:48,854 --> 01:55:50,344
Delilah! Delilah!

1823
01:55:50,589 --> 01:55:52,352
Delilah! Delilah!

1824
01:55:52,558 --> 01:55:56,494
Delilah! Delilah!

1825
01:56:02,268 --> 01:56:03,826
With a queen like you in Akron,

1826
01:56:04,071 --> 01:56:05,299
I could master the earth.

1827
01:56:05,505 --> 01:56:07,063
If you could master Delilah.

1828
01:56:07,274 --> 01:56:08,968
Ha ha. Ha ha.

1829
01:56:09,176 --> 01:56:11,838
We have Dancers in Ashkelon.

1830
01:56:12,012 --> 01:56:13,104
I came to see Samson.

1831
01:56:13,313 --> 01:56:16,111
Let this Danite clown make sport for us.

1832
01:56:16,316 --> 01:56:19,753
What sport can you find in
a blind man's stumbling?

1833
01:56:19,987 --> 01:56:22,080
This is your day of triumph.

1834
01:56:22,289 --> 01:56:23,450
All Gaza has come.

1835
01:56:23,658 --> 01:56:26,525
To see Samson humbled at your feet.

1836
01:56:26,727 --> 01:56:29,696
Bring him.

1837
01:56:44,712 --> 01:56:47,705
They look like Danites.

1838
01:56:47,950 --> 01:56:49,816
They are Danites.

1839
01:56:50,019 --> 01:56:52,385
Danites come to worship Dagon, eh?

1840
01:56:52,589 --> 01:56:55,056
No. We've come to speak with your king.

1841
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:59,227
Let go of us. Let go.

1842
01:57:04,268 --> 01:57:06,758
Dagon has delivered Samson our enemy

1843
01:57:07,004 --> 01:57:08,301
lnto our hands.

1844
01:57:08,506 --> 01:57:09,369
Call him forth.

1845
01:57:09,573 --> 01:57:13,771
That he may feel the might of Dagon.

1846
01:57:13,977 --> 01:57:16,503
Let us at him. Where is he?

1847
01:57:16,747 --> 01:57:21,685
Where is he? There he is.

1848
01:57:28,259 --> 01:57:31,058
Where's your god now, Samson?

1849
01:57:31,262 --> 01:57:34,563
He left his god for a peacock.

1850
01:57:34,766 --> 01:57:35,596
Humble him!

1851
01:57:35,801 --> 01:57:40,737
Make the blind ox Dance!

1852
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:47,278
By the horns of Nannar,
he's a man of iron.

1853
01:57:47,513 --> 01:57:49,675
He still looks strong enough
to kill a lion.

1854
01:57:49,882 --> 01:57:54,820
I wish I'd captured him.

1855
01:57:55,956 --> 01:57:57,423
Samson.

1856
01:57:57,658 --> 01:58:00,626
Samson!

1857
01:58:00,827 --> 01:58:03,796
After him!

1858
01:58:18,345 --> 01:58:19,473
Samson!

1859
01:58:19,682 --> 01:58:24,015
Let the hopping toad lead the
blind bear.

1860
01:58:24,219 --> 01:58:26,061
Little shepherd still following
his lost sheep.

1861
01:58:26,155 --> 01:58:27,451
Lead him, boy.

1862
01:58:27,655 --> 01:58:30,624
Yes. Let me feel the pillars.

1863
01:58:30,858 --> 01:58:32,223
Upon which the temple stands.

1864
01:58:32,427 --> 01:58:35,363
No. Get out where they can see you.

1865
01:58:35,564 --> 01:58:37,293
We've come to take you home.

1866
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:37,999
Miriam is...

1867
01:58:38,133 --> 01:58:39,623
No, Saul.

1868
01:58:39,868 --> 01:58:41,563
There's no home for a leader.

1869
01:58:41,771 --> 01:58:43,032
Who fails his people.

1870
01:58:43,239 --> 01:58:45,366
They'll always follow you, Samson.

1871
01:58:45,575 --> 01:58:47,542
I've led them a crooked path.

1872
01:58:47,777 --> 01:58:52,977
A blind man cannot travel by the stars.

1873
01:58:53,183 --> 01:58:56,584
Perhaps someday you will
guide them, Saul.

1874
01:58:56,787 --> 01:59:00,153
Join them together and be their
first king.

1875
01:59:00,357 --> 01:59:02,087
Me?

1876
01:59:02,292 --> 01:59:03,987
A king?

1877
01:59:04,195 --> 01:59:05,753
Get on with the sport!

1878
01:59:05,997 --> 01:59:08,466
I hear many voices.

1879
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:10,328
Ls the temple filled?

1880
01:59:10,534 --> 01:59:13,196
Packed like wheat in a shock.

1881
01:59:13,437 --> 01:59:14,904
Then go.

1882
01:59:15,106 --> 01:59:16,734
I've got my sling on my head.

1883
01:59:16,941 --> 01:59:19,308
We could fight our way out.

1884
01:59:19,511 --> 01:59:20,842
No, Saul.

1885
01:59:21,046 --> 01:59:22,445
Take Miriam and leave the temple.

1886
01:59:22,648 --> 01:59:24,616
But, Samson...

1887
01:59:24,816 --> 01:59:27,284
Let the sport begin.

1888
01:59:27,854 --> 01:59:29,377
Majesty, hear me!

1889
01:59:29,622 --> 01:59:32,385
Free the girl. Let her come.

1890
01:59:32,592 --> 01:59:35,060
Majesty...

1891
01:59:35,295 --> 01:59:37,229
You are a king a conqueror.

1892
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:38,658
I ask mercy.

1893
01:59:38,865 --> 01:59:40,730
Mercy? What have you done?

1894
01:59:40,933 --> 01:59:44,767
I as mercy for a blind and helpless man.

1895
01:59:44,971 --> 01:59:46,768
Look at him.

1896
01:59:46,973 --> 01:59:48,838
He cannot harm you now.

1897
01:59:49,042 --> 01:59:49,964
He has lost everything.

1898
01:59:50,077 --> 01:59:52,568
But the love of his people.

1899
01:59:52,813 --> 01:59:55,748
Let me take him back to them.

1900
01:59:55,949 --> 01:59:59,749
Have mercy, great king.

1901
01:59:59,953 --> 02:00:02,922
For this strength, I admire Samson.

1902
02:00:03,157 --> 02:00:06,252
For his revolt, I punish him.

1903
02:00:06,494 --> 02:00:10,430
For the love of his people, I envy him.

1904
02:00:10,665 --> 02:00:13,896
But, unfortunately,
he's not my prisoner.

1905
02:00:14,102 --> 02:00:15,933
He was not captured by force of arms,

1906
02:00:16,137 --> 02:00:18,469
But by their softness.

1907
02:00:18,673 --> 02:00:20,767
His conqueror is here.

1908
02:00:20,976 --> 02:00:23,206
If she wishes to give him to you,

1909
02:00:23,412 --> 02:00:27,348
She has my permission.

1910
02:00:28,284 --> 02:00:29,774
In the valley of Sorek,

1911
02:00:30,019 --> 02:00:31,987
You said you loved him.

1912
02:00:32,188 --> 02:00:35,056
Then set him free.

1913
02:00:35,258 --> 02:00:37,624
If there's love in you.

1914
02:00:37,828 --> 02:00:41,730
Let me take him back to his people.

1915
02:00:41,932 --> 02:00:45,732
What whimpering lies do you
tell our king?

1916
02:00:45,935 --> 02:00:47,961
You want him for yourself.

1917
02:00:48,205 --> 02:00:51,175
You want to feel his arms about you,

1918
02:00:51,376 --> 02:00:54,243
To hold him close and comfort him.

1919
02:00:54,445 --> 02:00:56,879
You want to bear him children.

1920
02:00:57,081 --> 02:01:01,279
I'd rather see him dead than in
your arms.

1921
02:01:01,486 --> 02:01:02,953
Take her away.

1922
02:01:03,186 --> 02:01:04,654
Guard.

1923
02:01:04,888 --> 02:01:06,881
Have mercy, great king.

1924
02:01:07,126 --> 02:01:11,028
Mercy for Samson!

1925
02:01:11,329 --> 02:01:13,991
Your mercy is like your love, Delilah.

1926
02:01:14,199 --> 02:01:17,168
Ruthless.

1927
02:01:43,730 --> 02:01:49,669
Where's your jawbone, Samson?

1928
02:01:53,541 --> 02:01:55,839
He'll get no honey from those bees.

1929
02:01:56,044 --> 02:01:57,943
The monkey men will cut him down.

1930
02:01:58,146 --> 02:01:59,612
They are devils.

1931
02:01:59,848 --> 02:02:01,542
No, they're very human.

1932
02:02:01,749 --> 02:02:03,377
The weak always band together.

1933
02:02:03,617 --> 02:02:05,245
To pull down the strong.

1934
02:02:05,454 --> 02:02:07,446
Your lion has become a mouse.

1935
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:13,595
Changed by the magic of love.

1936
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:30,079
Garmiskar!

1937
02:02:32,482 --> 02:02:34,007
Garmiskar!

1938
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:35,946
Garmiskar! Garmiskar!

1939
02:02:36,154 --> 02:02:36,677
Garmiskar! Garmiskar!

1940
02:02:36,921 --> 02:02:38,786
Make him beg for mercy!

1941
02:02:38,989 --> 02:02:41,184
Whip him to the god's feet.

1942
02:02:41,391 --> 02:02:44,259
He will never kneel to Dagon.

1943
02:02:44,428 --> 02:02:47,330
There's great persuasion at
the end of a whip.

1944
02:02:47,531 --> 02:02:49,726
No whip will break his spirit.

1945
02:02:49,934 --> 02:02:52,767
Either he kneel to Dagon or
he dies before him.

1946
02:02:52,972 --> 02:02:55,667
Ls this religious zeal, Ahtur?

1947
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:57,866
No high majesty.

1948
02:02:58,110 --> 02:03:01,079
Satisfaction.

1949
02:03:04,315 --> 02:03:05,442
What are they doing?

1950
02:03:05,683 --> 02:03:11,589
Little spiders weave their web.

1951
02:03:37,719 --> 02:03:43,657
The little fish have caught a whale.

1952
02:03:48,396 --> 02:03:49,056
Look. Look at Delilah.

1953
02:03:49,263 --> 02:03:52,631
I will go to him.

1954
02:03:52,835 --> 02:03:55,065
If you go to him,

1955
02:03:55,270 --> 02:04:01,209
You cannot come back to me.

1956
02:04:08,084 --> 02:04:09,881
Delilah! Delilah!

1957
02:04:10,087 --> 02:04:11,418
Delilah! Delilah!

1958
02:04:11,621 --> 02:04:13,145
Delilah! Delilah!

1959
02:04:13,389 --> 02:04:17,325
Delilah! Delilah!

1960
02:04:21,264 --> 02:04:24,701
He is mine to punish. Go.

1961
02:04:24,935 --> 02:04:26,596
Delilah.

1962
02:04:26,804 --> 02:04:27,998
I must hurt you, my love,

1963
02:04:28,206 --> 02:04:29,695
That all may see. Forgive me.

1964
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:32,408
I warned you to stay away.

1965
02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:35,044
When I strike, catch hold of the lash.

1966
02:04:35,245 --> 02:04:36,804
Lead me to the house of the temple.

1967
02:04:37,048 --> 02:04:40,017
I will.

1968
02:04:40,652 --> 02:04:42,119
Delilah! Delilah!

1969
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:43,309
Delilah! Delilah!

1970
02:04:43,555 --> 02:04:45,079
He stole my cloak, Delilah.

1971
02:04:45,323 --> 02:04:51,262
Let him wear the mark of your whip.

1972
02:05:00,272 --> 02:05:02,103
He leads like a goat,

1973
02:05:02,308 --> 02:05:04,276
Why can't I lead you like that?

1974
02:05:04,477 --> 02:05:08,414
You're not Delilah.

1975
02:05:10,817 --> 02:05:12,580
Make him crawl, Delilah.

1976
02:05:12,786 --> 02:05:15,346
Put a ring through his nose!

1977
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:18,717
Your peacock makes sport with an ox.

1978
02:05:18,925 --> 02:05:22,589
She is mocking us, not Samson.

1979
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:25,958
Lord of the harvest, conqueror of death,

1980
02:05:26,167 --> 02:05:29,500
Now shall Samson be humble at your feet.

1981
02:05:29,704 --> 02:05:31,170
Make him bow!

1982
02:05:31,372 --> 02:05:32,862
Bend his neck before Dagon!

1983
02:05:33,107 --> 02:05:39,047
Look, Delilah made him bow!

1984
02:05:41,183 --> 02:05:43,048
I'm weary, Delilah.

1985
02:05:43,251 --> 02:05:44,240
Let me feel the pillars.

1986
02:05:44,485 --> 02:05:45,526
That I may lean upon them.

1987
02:05:45,587 --> 02:05:49,523
Only a little further.

1988
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:58,455
Humble yourself before their god,
Samson.

1989
02:05:58,701 --> 02:06:00,829
Kneel.

1990
02:06:01,037 --> 02:06:03,301
The house of this temple stands
on these columns?

1991
02:06:03,505 --> 02:06:06,474
Yes, Kneel.

1992
02:06:08,446 --> 02:06:09,936
The stone is cool

1993
02:06:10,181 --> 02:06:11,512
I will rest here.

1994
02:06:11,715 --> 02:06:14,048
Let him be scourged.

1995
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:19,416
Until he turns from his god.

1996
02:06:19,623 --> 02:06:20,884
Go, Delilah.

1997
02:06:21,091 --> 02:06:23,186
Run. Into the courtyard.

1998
02:06:23,395 --> 02:06:25,226
No.

1999
02:06:25,429 --> 02:06:28,365
Death will come into this temple.

2000
02:06:28,567 --> 02:06:31,297
The hand of the lord will strike.

2001
02:06:31,502 --> 02:06:33,971
I will not be afraid.

2002
02:06:34,171 --> 02:06:38,109
You must leave now.

2003
02:06:38,443 --> 02:06:42,642
Wherever you are, my love is with you.

2004
02:06:42,849 --> 02:06:45,340
Go.

2005
02:06:45,585 --> 02:06:47,449
Make him kneel to Dagon!

2006
02:06:47,653 --> 02:06:50,212
Yes! Make him kneel!

2007
02:06:50,422 --> 02:06:55,020
He'll not kneel to any god but his own.

2008
02:06:55,228 --> 02:07:01,167
The edge of a sword will bend his knees.

2009
02:07:02,201 --> 02:07:05,170
Delilah.

2010
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:09,041
Have you gone?

2011
02:07:09,943 --> 02:07:12,912
Delilah!

2012
02:07:16,717 --> 02:07:18,184
I pray thee,

2013
02:07:18,386 --> 02:07:20,820
Strengthen me, o god.

2014
02:07:21,021 --> 02:07:26,962
Strengthen me only this once.

2015
02:07:31,399 --> 02:07:34,800
He thinks they're too close together!

2016
02:07:35,003 --> 02:07:35,971
What's he doing?

2017
02:07:36,204 --> 02:07:42,144
He's holding up the temple.

2018
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:48,240
Scourge Samson to his knees.

2019
02:07:48,485 --> 02:07:54,424
Beneath the feet of Dagon.

2020
02:07:59,563 --> 02:08:01,360
This is better than I'd bargained for.

2021
02:08:01,565 --> 02:08:03,465
Why, the man's crazed.

2022
02:08:03,667 --> 02:08:09,574
He's the funniest clown I've ever seen.

2023
02:08:28,927 --> 02:08:30,418
Look!

2024
02:08:30,662 --> 02:08:33,631
It moved.

2025
02:08:38,003 --> 02:08:38,972
The column's moving.

2026
02:08:39,172 --> 02:08:40,537
He's split the stone.

2027
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:43,676
The man has the strength of a devil.

2028
02:08:43,877 --> 02:08:48,815
No the strength of a god.

2029
02:08:52,286 --> 02:08:53,753
Dagon, be more powerful than Samson.

2030
02:08:53,989 --> 02:08:58,925
Forward! Run him through!

2031
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:13,233
My eyes have seen thy glory, o god.

2032
02:09:13,441 --> 02:09:17,172
Now let me die with my enemies.

2033
02:09:17,379 --> 02:09:19,313
Kill him!

2034
02:09:19,514 --> 02:09:22,484
Cut him down!

2035
02:09:39,603 --> 02:09:41,298
Run, lord saran. Save yourself.

2036
02:09:41,505 --> 02:09:44,473
Save yourself.

2037
02:09:46,343 --> 02:09:49,312
No! Oh!

2038
02:09:58,589 --> 02:10:01,558
Delilah.

2039
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:33,459
Mercy!

2040
02:10:40,134 --> 02:10:44,070
Lift it off! Help me!

2041
02:10:56,251 --> 02:10:58,775
He was so strong.

2042
02:10:59,020 --> 02:11:01,546
Why did he have to die?

2043
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:07,728
His strength will never die, Saul.

2044
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:16,260
Men will tell his story for a
thousand years.
