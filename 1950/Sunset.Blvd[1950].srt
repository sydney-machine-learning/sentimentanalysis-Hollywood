1
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:30,241
<i>Yes, this is Sunset Boulevard,</i>
<i>Los Angeles, California.</i>

2
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:33,524
<i>It; s about five o; clock in the morning.</i>

3
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:38,158
<i>That; s the homicide squad, complete</i>
<i>with detectives and newspapermen.</i>

4
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:44,246
<i>A murder; s been reported from one</i>
<i>of those houses in the 10000 block.</i>

5
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:47,285
<i>You; ll read about it</i>
<i>in the late editions.</i>

6
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:51,042
<i>You; ll get it over your radio</i>
<i>and on television,</i>

7
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:56,486
<i>because an old-time star is involved,</i>
<i>one of the biggest.</i>

8
00:01:56,647 --> 00:02:00,401
<i>But before you hear it all distorted</i>
<i>and blown out of proportion,</i>

9
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:03,764
<i>before those Hollywood</i>
<i>columnists get their hands on it,</i>

10
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:08,318
<i>maybe you; d like to hear the facts,</i>
<i>the whole truth.</i>

11
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:12,082
<i>If so, you; ve come to the right party.</i>

12
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:16,365
<i>The body of a young man was found</i>
<i>in the pool of her mansion,</i>

13
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:21,601
<i>with two shots in his back and one</i>
<i>in his stomach. Nobody important.</i>

14
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,601
<i>Just a writer with a couple</i>
<i>of B-pictures to his credit.</i>

15
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:30,361
<i>The poor dope!</i>
<i>He always wanted a pool.</i>

16
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:37,046
<i>In the end, he got himself a pool,</i>
<i>only the price turned out a little high.</i>

17
00:02:38,887 --> 00:02:43,438
<i>Let; s go back about six months</i>
<i>and find the day when it all started.</i>

18
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:47,486
<i>I was living in an apartment house</i>
<i>above Franklin and lvar.</i>

19
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:49,956
<i>Things were tough at the moment.</i>

20
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:53,836
<i>I hadn; t worked</i>
<i>in a studio for a long time.</i>

21
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,922
<i>So I sat there grinding out</i>
<i>original stories, two a week.</i>

22
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:01,999
<i>Only I seemed to have lost my touch.</i>

23
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:07,480
<i>Maybe they weren; t original enough,</i>
<i>maybe they were too original.</i>

24
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:11,925
<i>All I know is,</i>
<i>they didn; t sell.</i>

25
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:14,798
Yep?

26
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:25,677
- Joseph C Gillis?
- That's right.

27
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:30,079
- We've come for the car.
- What car?

28
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:34,763
1946 Plymouth convertible,
California licence 40 R 116.

29
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:38,556
- Where are the keys?
- Why should I give you them?

30
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:42,436
The company's played ball long
enough, you're three payments behind.

31
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,519
And we've got a court order.
The keys.

32
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:50,158
- Or do you want us to haul it away?
- The car isn't here.

33
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:53,364
- Is that so?
- I loaned it to a friend.

34
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:56,917
- He took it to Palm Springs.
- Gone away for his health?

35
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:02,798
- If you don't believe me, look.
- We believe you, now believe us.

36
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:06,926
That car better be here by noon
tomorrow or there'll be fireworks.

37
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,806
You say the cutest things.

38
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:26,522
<i>I needed about $290 and I needed</i>
<i>it real quick, or l; d lose my car.</i>

39
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:30,646
<i>It wasn; t in Palm Springs,</i>
<i>and it wasn; t in the garage.</i>

40
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:33,605
<i>I was way ahead</i>
<i>of the finance company.</i>

41
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:37,123
<i>I knew they; d come</i>
<i>and I wasn; t taking chances.</i>

42
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:42,486
<i>So I kept it across the street</i>
<i>behind Rudy; s shoeshine parlour.</i>

43
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,798
<i>Rudy never asked any questions</i>
<i>about your finances,</i>

44
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:49,323
<i>he; d just look at your heels</i>
<i>and know the score.</i>

45
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:56,438
<i>I had an original story</i>
<i>kicking around Paramount.</i>

46
00:04:56,607 --> 00:05:02,204
<i>My agent said it was dead,</i>
<i>but I knew a bigshot who liked me.</i>

47
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:06,838
<i>The time had come to take advantage</i>
<i>of it. His name was Sheldrake.</i>

48
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:12,365
<i>He was a smart producer</i>
<i>with a set of ulcers to prove it.</i>

49
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,159
You've got five minutes.
What's your story about?

50
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:21,526
A baseball player, a rookie shortstop
that's batting 347, once did a hold-up,

51
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:25,123
but he's trying to go straight,
except some gamblers won't let him.

52
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:28,484
They tell him
he's got to throw the World Series?

53
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:31,115
More or less. I've got a gimmick.

54
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:34,324
- Got a title?
- "Bases Loaded". There's an outline.

55
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:38,400
Call readers department, find out
what they have on "Bases Loaded".

56
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:42,678
They're pretty hot about it
at Twentieth, except Zanuck's all wet.

57
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:45,042
Can you see
Ty Power as the shortstop?

58
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:47,767
You've got the best man, Alan Ladd.

59
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:51,397
It'd be a change of pace for Ladd.
And simple to shoot.

60
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:55,879
Lots of outdoors stuff. I bet you
could make it for under a million.

61
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,515
- Excuse me.
- There's a great part for Bill Demarest.

62
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:02,646
An old trainer got beaned,
goes out of his head sometimes.

63
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:06,925
Hello, Mr Sheldrake. "Bases Loaded",
I covered it with a two-page synopsis.

64
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,362
- Thanks.
- But I wouldn't bother.

65
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,165
- What's wrong?
- It's from hunger.

66
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:13,045
Nothing for Ladd?

67
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,880
It's a rehash of something
not very good.

68
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:21,804
You'll be glad to meet Mr Gillis,
he wrote it. This is Miss Kramer.

69
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:28,520
The name's Schaefer, Betty Schaefer.
I wish I could crawl in a hole with it.

70
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:33,715
- If I could be of any help.
- Sorry, I just didn't think it was good.

71
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:35,878
I found it flat and trite.

72
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,956
What kind of material do you
recommend? Joyce, Dostoyevsky?

73
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,277
I think pictures should say something.

74
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:47,119
Just a story won't do. You'd have
turned down "Gone with the Wind".

75
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:51,485
No, that was me. I said,
"Who wants to see a Civil War picture?"

76
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:57,197
I hated "Bases Loaded" because I knew
your name. I'd heard you had talent.

77
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,278
This year, I'm trying to earn a living.

78
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:02,803
So you take plot 27 A,
make it glossy and slick?

79
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:06,164
Those are dirty words.
You sound like New York critics.

80
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:10,240
- That'll be all Miss Kramer... Schaefer.
- Goodbye, Mr Gillis.

81
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:13,524
Next time, I'll write you
"The Naked and the Dead".

82
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:18,522
Well, seems like Zanuck
has got himself a baseball picture.

83
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:22,043
Don't think I thought
this would win an Academy Award.

84
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:26,758
We're looking for a Betty Hutton.
Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?

85
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:29,521
- Frankly, no.
- Wait a minute.

86
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:32,884
If we made it a girls' softball team,
put in a few numbers,

87
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:37,677
might be a musical: "It Happened in
the Bullpen: The Story of a Woman".

88
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:42,845
Are you trying to be funny, because
I'm out of laughs. I need a job.

89
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:46,795
- I haven't got a thing.
- Any assignment, additional dialogue.

90
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,400
Nothing, honest.

91
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:56,441
Mr Sheldrake, could you let me have
300 bucks as a personal loan?

92
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:59,441
Could I? Gillis...

93
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,961
Last year, somebody talked me
into buying a ranch,

94
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:06,641
so I borrowed the money.

95
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:11,756
This year, I had to mortgage the
ranch to keep up my life insurance...

96
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,920
<i>After that,</i>
<i>I drove down to headquarters.</i>

97
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:21,045
<i>That; s how a lot of us</i>
<i>think about Schwab; s drugstore.</i>

98
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:24,916
<i>Kind of a combination office,</i>
<i>Kaffeeklatsch and waiting room.</i>

99
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,875
<i>Waiting... Waiting for the gravy train.</i>

100
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:35,198
<i>I got myself ten nickels and started</i>
<i>sending out a general SOS.</i>

101
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,165
<i>I couldn; t get hold of my agent,</i>
<i>naturally.</i>

102
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:41,524
<i>So I called a pal of mine,</i>
<i>Artie Green.</i>

103
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,406
<i>An awful nice guy,</i>
<i>an assistant director.</i>

104
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:48,924
<i>He could let me have twenty,</i>
<i>but twenty wouldn; t do.</i>

105
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:54,320
<i>Then I talked to a couple of yes-men</i>
<i>at Metro. To me, they said no.</i>

106
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:58,162
<i>Finally, I located that agent of mine.</i>
<i>The big faker!</i>

107
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:02,716
<i>Was he out digging up</i>
<i>a job for poor Joe Gillis?</i>

108
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:07,324
<i>He was hard at work in Bel Air,</i>
<i>making with the golf sticks.</i>

109
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:15,000
You need $300? Of course I could
give you $300, only I'm not going to.

110
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,284
- No?
- I'm not just your agent.

111
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:21,917
- It's not the 10%. I'm your friend.
- You are?

112
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:25,318
The finest things have been
written on an empty stomach.

113
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:29,036
Once your talent gets into that
Mocambo-Romanoff rut, you're through.

114
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:33,359
Forget that! It's a car I'm talking
about. Losing it is like losing my legs.

115
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:38,282
Greatest thing that could happen.
Now you'll have to sit down and write.

116
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:42,122
What do you think I've been doing?
I need $300.

117
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:47,645
Sweetheart, maybe what
you need is another agent.

118
00:09:57,207 --> 00:10:01,041
<i>As I drove back towards town,</i>
<i>I took inventory of my prospects.</i>

119
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:03,596
<i>They now added up to exactly zero.</i>

120
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:06,839
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>I just didn; t have what it takes.</i>

121
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,886
<i>The time had come to wrap up</i>
<i>the Hollywood deal and go home.</i>

122
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:15,404
<i>Maybe if I hocked all my junk, there; d
<i>be enough for a ticket back to Ohio,</i>

123
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:20,357
<i>to that $35-a-week job at the copy</i>
<i>desk of the; ; Dayton Evening Post; ;,</i>

124
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:25,282
<i>if it was still open, back</i>
<i>to the smirking delight of the office.</i>

125
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:29,122
<i>All right, why don; t you</i>
<i>take a crack at Hollywood?</i>

126
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:31,084
<i>Maybe you think you could...</i>

127
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:34,159
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

128
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,759
<i>l; d landed in the driveway</i>
<i>of some big mansion</i>

129
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,646
<i>that looked rundown and deserted.</i>

130
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:36,560
<i>At the end of the drive</i>
<i>was a lovely sight.</i>

131
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:41,482
<i>A great big empty garage,</i>
<i>just standing there going to waste.</i>

132
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:47,244
<i>If ever there was a place to stash</i>
<i>a car with a hot licence number.</i>

133
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,840
<i>There was another</i>
<i>occupant in that garage.</i>

134
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,919
<i>An enormous</i>
<i>foreign-built automobile.</i>

135
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,397
<i>It must; ve burned up</i>
<i>ten gallons to a mile.</i>

136
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:10,483
<i>It had a 1932 licence. I figured that; s
<i>when the owners had moved out.</i>

137
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:16,406
<i>I couldn; t go back to my apartment</i>
<i>now those bloodhounds were on to me.</i>

138
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:21,436
<i>The idea was to stay at Artie Green; s
<i>until I could make that bus for Ohio.</i>

139
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,883
<i>Once in Dayton,</i>
<i>l; d drop the credit boys a postcard</i>

140
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:28,801
<i>telling them</i>
<i>where to pick up the jalopy.</i>

141
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:33,684
<i>It was a great big</i>
<i>white elephant of a place.</i>

142
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:37,522
<i>The kind crazy movie people</i>
<i>built in the crazy twenties.</i>

143
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:40,963
<i>A neglected house</i>
<i>gets an unhappy look.</i>

144
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,516
<i>This one had it in spades.</i>

145
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:46,918
<i>It was like that old woman</i>
<i>in; ; Great Expectations; ;,</i>

146
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:51,285
<i>that Miss Havisham in her rotting</i>
<i>wedding dress and her torn veil,</i>

147
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:55,804
<i>taking it out on the world</i>
<i>because she; d been given the go-by.</i>

148
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:04,398
You there, why are you so late?

149
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:09,839
Why have you kept me
waiting so long?

150
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:18,966
In here.

151
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,926
I just put my car in the garage.
I had a blowout. I thought...

152
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:32,602
- Go on in.
- Maybe I'd better take my car...

153
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,235
Wipe your feet.

154
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:39,279
Go on.

155
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:46,518
You're not properly
dressed for the occasion.

156
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:50,521
- What's the occasion?
- Have him come up, Max.

157
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:53,599
- Up the stairs.
- Listen for a minute...

158
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:57,442
- Madame is waiting.
- For me?

159
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:00,279
OK.

160
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:09,799
If you need help
with the coffin, call me.

161
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,000
This way.

162
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,845
In here.

163
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:41,200
I put him on my massage table
by the fire.

164
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:45,918
He always liked fires
and poking at them with a stick.

165
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:54,196
We'll bury him in the garden.
Any city laws against that?

166
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,523
- I wouldn't know.
- I don't care, anyway.

167
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:01,805
I want the coffin to be white
and specially lined with satin,

168
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,357
white or deep pink.

169
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:11,599
Maybe red, bright, flaming red.
Let's make it gay.

170
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:24,678
How much? Don't give me
a fancy price just because I'm rich.

171
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:30,958
Lady, you've got the wrong man.
I had some trouble with a flat tyre.

172
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:35,962
I pulled in till I could get a spare.
I thought the house was empty.

173
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:40,757
- It is not. Get out.
- I'm sorry.

174
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:46,206
I'm sorry you lost your friend.
I don't think red is the right colour.

175
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:51,282
- Haven't I seen you before?
- Get out, or shall I call my servant?

176
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:55,397
You're Norma Desmond.
You were big in silent pictures.

177
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:02,002
I am big. It's the pictures
that got small.

178
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:05,763
I knew there was
something wrong with them.

179
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:08,157
They're dead, they're finished.

180
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:12,161
There was a time
when they had the eyes of the world.

181
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:16,639
But that wasn't good enough.
They had to have the ears, too.

182
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:21,358
So they opened their big mouths
and out came talk, talk, talk!

183
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:25,679
That's where the popcorn business
comes in. Buy it to plug your ears.

184
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:29,396
Look at them in the front offices,
the masterminds!

185
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,558
They smashed the idols!

186
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:34,321
The Fairbankses,
the Gilberts, the Valentinos!

187
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:37,001
Who've we got now? Some nobody.

188
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,920
Don't blame me. I'm just a writer.

189
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:43,963
You are? Writing words,
words, more words.

190
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,960
You've made a rope of words
and strangled this business.

191
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,925
But there's a microphone
to catch the last gurgles,

192
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:52,726
and Technicolor to photograph
the swollen tongue.

193
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:57,563
- Sh! You'll wake up the monkey.
- Get out! Max.

194
00:16:57,727 --> 00:17:00,116
Next time
I'll bring my autograph album.

195
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:03,996
Or maybe some cement
and ask for your footprint.

196
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,164
It's OK, OK. I'm going.

197
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:13,036
Just a minute, you.
You're a writer, you said.

198
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:15,926
- Why?
- Are you or not?

199
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:21,366
- That's what's on my Guild card.
- And you have written pictures?

200
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:24,325
I sure have. Want a list of my credits?

201
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:27,160
I want to ask you something.
Come in here.

202
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,887
Last one was about
Okies in the Dust Bowl.

203
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,003
You'd never know
because on screen

204
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:35,443
the whole thing
played on a torpedo boat.

205
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:45,636
Intimate, isn't it?

206
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:51,037
The wind gets in that pipe organ.
I ought to take it out.

207
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:53,277
I'd teach it a better tune.

208
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,517
Young man, tell me something.

209
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:59,362
How long is a movie script
these days? How many pages?

210
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:01,563
Depends whether
it's "Donald Duck" or "Joan of Arc".

211
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:07,085
This is to be a very important picture.
I've written it myself. Took me years.

212
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,203
Looks like enough
for six important pictures.

213
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:12,086
It's Salome's story.
I'll have DeMille direct.

214
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:16,799
- DeMille?
- We made a lot of pictures together.

215
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:20,926
- And you'll play Salome.
- Who else?

216
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:24,122
I didn't know
you were planning a comeback.

217
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:27,199
I hate that word. It's a return.

218
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:31,645
A return to the millions who've never
forgiven me for deserting the screen.

219
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,561
- Fair enough.
- Salome. What a woman.

220
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:39,436
What a part. The princess
in love with a holy man.

221
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:41,643
She dances the dance
of the seven veils.

222
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:45,163
He rejects her, so she demands
his head on a golden tray.

223
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:48,717
Kissing his cold, dead lips.

224
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:52,882
- They'll love it in Pomona.
- They'll love it everyplace.

225
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,481
Read the scene
just before she has him killed.

226
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:57,842
Another writer
may steal your material.

227
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:00,362
I'm not afraid. Read it.

228
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:04,918
Bring something to drink.
Sit down. Is there enough light?

229
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,638
- I've got 20-20 vision.
- I said sit down.

230
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,920
<i>Well, I had no</i>
<i>pressing engagement.</i>

231
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:18,965
<i>Except with those boys</i>
<i>from the finance office.</i>

232
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:23,439
<i>And she; d mentioned</i>
<i>something to drink. Why not?</i>

233
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:28,806
<i>Sometimes it; s interesting to see</i>
<i>just how bad bad writing can be.</i>

234
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,640
<i>This promised to go the limit.</i>

235
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:37,359
<i>What would a handwriting expert</i>
<i>make of her childish scrawl?</i>

236
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:42,117
<i>Max wheeled in</i>
<i>some champagne and caviar.</i>

237
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:47,486
<i>Later I found out Max was the only</i>
<i>other person in that grim castle.</i>

238
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:51,162
<i>And I found out</i>
<i>a few other things about him.</i>

239
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:54,842
<i>As for her, she sat coiled up</i>
<i>like a watch-spring,</i>

240
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,760
<i>her cigarette clamped</i>
<i>in a curious holder.</i>

241
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:00,885
<i>I could sense her watching me</i>
<i>through those dark glasses,</i>

242
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:03,800
<i>defying me not to like what I read,</i>

243
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,926
<i>or maybe begging me</i>
<i>in her own proud way to like it.</i>

244
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:11,124
<i>It meant so much to her.</i>

245
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:18,837
<i>It sure was a cosy set-up.</i>

246
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:24,081
<i>That bundle of raw nerves and Max</i>
<i>and a dead monkey upstairs,</i>

247
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:28,718
<i>and the wind wheezing through</i>
<i>that organ once in a while.</i>

248
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,164
<i>Later on, just for comedy relief,</i>

249
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:42,036
<i>the real guy arrived</i>
<i>with the baby coffin.</i>

250
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,517
<i>It was all done with great dignity.</i>

251
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:48,759
<i>He must have been</i>
<i>a very important chimp.</i>

252
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:52,715
<i>The great-grandson</i>
<i>of King Kong maybe.</i>

253
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:59,723
<i>It got to be eleven, and I felt</i>
<i>a little sick at my stomach,</i>

254
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:03,766
<i>what with that sweet champagne</i>
<i>and that tripe l; d been reading,</i>

255
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:08,079
<i>that silly hodgepodge</i>
<i>of melodramatic plots.</i>

256
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:14,482
<i>However, by then, l; d started</i>
<i>concocting a little plot of my own.</i>

257
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:18,845
- Well?
- This is fascinating.

258
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:21,362
Of course it is.

259
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:27,356
Maybe it's a little long and repetitious,
but you're not a professional writer.

260
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:32,521
- I wrote that with my heart.
- Sure you did.

261
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:34,803
That's what makes it great.

262
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:40,603
- But it needs a little more dialogue.
- What for?

263
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:44,919
- My eyes can say anything I want.
- It could use some shears.

264
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:48,875
- I will not have it butchered.
- Of course not.

265
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:53,325
But it ought to be organised, edited.
You can find somebody.

266
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:57,241
Who? I'd have
to have somebody I could trust.

267
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:59,921
When were you born?
What zodiac sign?

268
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:03,124
- I don't know.
- What month?

269
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:05,164
December, 21 st.

270
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,717
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians,
you can trust them.

271
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:12,519
- Thank you.
- I want you to do this work.

272
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:18,478
Me? I'm busy. I just finished a script
and I'm doing another assignment.

273
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:20,877
I don't care.

274
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:25,479
You know, I'm pretty expensive.
I get $500 a week.

275
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:29,845
I wouldn't worry about money.
I'll make it worth your while.

276
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:33,920
- I'll read the rest at home.
- I couldn't let it out of my house.

277
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:37,921
- Finish it here.
- It's getting kind of late.

278
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:42,084
- Are you married, Mr?
- Gillis. Single.

279
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,523
- Where do you live?
- Hollywood. Alto Nido apartments.

280
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:49,441
- Something's wrong with your car?
- There sure is.

281
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:53,043
- Why not stay here?
- I'll come back early tomorrow.

282
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,643
Nonsense.
There's a room over the garage.

283
00:22:56,807 --> 00:23:00,846
Max will take you there.
Max!

284
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:07,766
<i>I felt kind of pleased</i>
<i>with the way l; d handled the situation.</i>

285
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:11,078
<i>I dropped the hook,</i>
<i>and she snapped at it.</i>

286
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:15,286
<i>My car would be safe down below</i>
<i>while I patched up the script.</i>

287
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:19,637
<i>And there should be</i>
<i>plenty of money in it.</i>

288
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:26,367
This room hasn't been
used for a long time.

289
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:30,156
It'll never make "House Beautiful",
but it's OK for one night.

290
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:36,323
- I made your bed this afternoon.
- How did you know I'd stay?

291
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:41,607
The bathroom's there. I put in some
towels, soap and a toothbrush.

292
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:48,725
Say, she's quite a character
that Norma Desmond.

293
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:52,516
She was the greatest.
You wouldn't know, you're too young.

294
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:56,157
In one week,
she received 17,000 fan letters.

295
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:59,603
Men bribed the hairdresser
for a lock of her hair.

296
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:04,682
There was an Indian maharajah who
came to beg one of her stockings.

297
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:07,998
Later he strangled himself with it.

298
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:11,603
Well, I sure turned
into an interesting driveway.

299
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:14,964
You did, sir. Goodnight, sir.

300
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:23,597
<i>I pegged him as slightly cuckoo, too.</i>

301
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,601
<i>A stroke maybe.</i>

302
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:32,763
<i>The whole place seemed stricken</i>
<i>with a creeping paralysis,</i>

303
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:37,842
<i>out of beat with the rest of the world,</i>
<i>crumbling apart in slow motion.</i>

304
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:43,756
<i>There was a tennis court,</i>
<i>or rather the ghost of a tennis court,</i>

305
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:47,476
<i>with faded markings</i>
<i>and a sagging net.</i>

306
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:55,403
<i>And, of course, she had a pool.</i>
<i>Who didn; t then?</i>

307
00:24:55,567 --> 00:25:00,721
<i>Mabel Normand and John Gilbert</i>
<i>swam in it 10,000 midnights ago.</i>

308
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:04,516
<i>And Vilma Banky</i>
<i>and Rod La Rocque.</i>

309
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:08,566
<i>It was empty now. Or was it?</i>

310
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:21,279
<i>There was something else going on:</i>
<i>the last rites for that hairy old chimp,</i>

311
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:24,757
<i>performed</i>
<i>with the utmost seriousness,</i>

312
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:28,886
<i>as if she were laying to rest</i>
<i>an only child.</i>

313
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:33,566
<i>Was her life really as empty as that?</i>

314
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:46,555
<i>It was all very queer,</i>
<i>but queerer things were yet to come.</i>

315
00:25:54,527 --> 00:26:00,045
<i>That night I had a mixed-up dream.</i>
<i>In it there was an organ grinder.</i>

316
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:03,916
<i>I couldn; t see his face,</i>
<i>but the organ was draped in black.</i>

317
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:07,557
<i>And a chimp</i>
<i>was dancing for pennies.</i>

318
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:11,925
<i>When I opened my eyes,</i>
<i>the music was still there.</i>

319
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:14,043
<i>Where was I?</i>

320
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:20,561
<i>Oh, yes, in that empty room</i>
<i>over her garage.</i>

321
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:26,040
<i>Only it wasn; t empty any more.</i>
<i>l; d had a visitor.</i>

322
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:30,997
<i>Someone had brought in my belongings,</i>
<i>my books, typewriter and clothes.</i>

323
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:34,921
<i>What was going on?</i>

324
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:57,126
Hey, you! Max, whatever your name
is, what are my things doing here?

325
00:26:57,287 --> 00:27:01,360
I'm talking to you. My clothes
and things are up in the room.

326
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:05,406
Naturally. I brought them myself.

327
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:10,118
- Is that so?
- What's the matter? Anything missing?

328
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:14,075
- Who asked you to?
- I did.

329
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:17,842
I don't know why you're so upset.
Stop that playing, Max.

330
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:22,159
It seemed like a good idea
if we are to work together.

331
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,686
I'm to fix your script. There's nothing
in the deal about staying here.

332
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:29,964
- You'll like it here.
- I've my own apartment.

333
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:32,402
You owe three months' rent.

334
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:36,401
- I'll take care of that.
- It's all taken care of, all paid for.

335
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:40,917
We'll deduct it from my salary.

336
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:45,202
Let's not be small about such matters.
We won't keep books.

337
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:50,317
- Unpack Mr Gillis's things.
- It is done, Madame.

338
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:54,799
- Pack 'em up again. I'm not staying!
- Make up your mind.

339
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:58,084
Do you want this job or don't you?

340
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,562
<i>I wanted the job and the dough</i>
<i>and to get out of there quickly.</i>

341
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:09,680
<i>I thought if I got going</i>
<i>I could finish it in a couple of weeks.</i>

342
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:14,967
<i>But it wasn; t so simple getting</i>
<i>coherence into her wild hallucinations.</i>

343
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:19,917
<i>It was made tougher with her</i>
<i>around all the time, hovering over me,</i>

344
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:25,241
<i>afraid l; d do injury</i>
<i>to that precious brainchild of hers.</i>

345
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,923
What's that?

346
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:35,079
- Just a scene I threw out.
- Which scene?

347
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:38,159
The slave market.
It's better to cut directly to...

348
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:40,636
Cut away from me?

349
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:44,163
It's too much of you.
They don't want you in every scene.

350
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:49,162
Then why do they still write me fan
letters and beg for my photographs?

351
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:53,115
Because they want to see me -
me, Norma Desmond.

352
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:55,403
Put it back.

353
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,320
OK.

354
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,964
<i>I didn; t argue with her.</i>

355
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:16,564
<i>You don; t yell at a sleepwalker.</i>
<i>He may fall and break his neck.</i>

356
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:21,642
<i>That; s it. She was still sleepwalking</i>
<i>along the giddy heights of a lost career.</i>

357
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:26,483
<i>Plain crazy when it came</i>
<i>to that one subject: her celluloid self.</i>

358
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:28,956
<i>The great Norma Desmond.</i>

359
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:33,439
<i>How could she breathe in that house</i>
<i>so crowded with Norma Desmonds?</i>

360
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:39,762
<i>More Norma Desmonds</i>
<i>and still more Norma Desmonds.</i>

361
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:43,277
<i>It wasn; t all work, of course.</i>

362
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:46,883
<i>Three times a week,</i>
<i>Max hauled up that painting</i>

363
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:50,005
<i>presented to her by some</i>
<i>Nevada chamber of commerce.</i>

364
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:54,595
<i>And we; d see a movie,</i>
<i>right in her living room.</i>

365
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:58,123
<i>So much nicer than going out,</i>
<i>she; d say.</i>

366
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:02,166
<i>The plain fact was</i>
<i>she was afraid of that world outside,</i>

367
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:06,320
<i>afraid it would remind her</i>
<i>that time had passed.</i>

368
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:11,963
<i>They were silent movies, and Max</i>
<i>would run the projection machine.</i>

369
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:13,879
<i>Just as well.</i>

370
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:18,563
<i>It kept him from giving us</i>
<i>an accompaniment on that organ.</i>

371
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:23,796
<i>She; d sit very close to me,</i>
<i>and she; d smell of tuberoses.</i>

372
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:27,437
<i>Not my favourite perfume,</i>
<i>not by a long shot.</i>

373
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:31,600
<i>Sometimes as we watched,</i>
<i>she; d clutch my arm or my hand,</i>

374
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:33,837
<i>forgetting she was my employer,</i>

375
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:39,923
<i>just becoming a fan, excited about</i>
<i>that actress up there on the screen.</i>

376
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:44,003
<i>I don; t have to tell you</i>
<i>who the star was.</i>

377
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:49,480
<i>They were always her pictures.</i>
<i>That; s all she wanted to see.</i>

378
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:18,596
Still wonderful, isn't it?
And no dialogue.

379
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:22,646
We didn't need dialogue.
We had faces.

380
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:28,677
There just aren't any faces like
that any more. Maybe one, Garbo.

381
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:34,437
Those idiot producers, those imbeciles!
Haven't they got eyes?

382
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:37,201
Have they forgotten
what a star looks like?

383
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:40,040
I'll be up there again, so help me!

384
00:31:49,887 --> 00:31:52,879
<i>Sometimes there; d be</i>
<i>a little bridge game.</i>

385
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:57,165
<i>With a twentieth of a cent a point.</i>
<i>l; d get half her winnings.</i>

386
00:31:57,327 --> 00:32:02,799
<i>Once they ran up to 70 cents, which</i>
<i>was about the only cash I ever got.</i>

387
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:05,720
<i>The other players</i>
<i>would be actor friends,</i>

388
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:09,516
<i>dim figures you may still remember</i>
<i>from the silent days.</i>

389
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:12,247
<i>I thought of them as her waxworks.</i>

390
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:15,604
- One diamond.
- One heart.

391
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:21,042
- A spade.
- Pass.

392
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:24,324
- Three no trump.
- Pass.

393
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:28,878
- Pass.
- Empty the ashtray, Joe, dear.

394
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:57,801
- Some men outside ask for you.
- I'm not here.

395
00:32:57,967 --> 00:32:59,844
- That's what I said.
- Good.

396
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:03,920
But they found your car and
they're going to tow it away.

397
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:09,605
Where's the ashtray?
Joe, can't we have the ashtray?

398
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:18,482
- I want to talk to you.
- Not now, I'm playing three no trump.

399
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:20,638
They've come for my car.

400
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:23,446
I've forgotten
how many spades are out!

401
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:26,917
- I need money now.
- Can't you wait until I'm dummy?

402
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:29,840
- No.
- Please.

403
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:06,801
- Now, what is it? Where's the fire?
- I've lost my car.

404
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,197
I thought it
was a matter of life and death.

405
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:14,236
It is, to me. That's why I came to this
house and took this job, ghost-writing.

406
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:17,922
You're being silly. We don't need
two cars, we have one.

407
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:22,558
Not a cheap thing made of chromium
and spit: an Isotta Fraschini.

408
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,195
Ever heard of Isotta Fraschinis?

409
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:29,485
All handmade. Cost me $28,000.

410
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:36,681
<i>So Max got that old bus</i>
<i>off its blocks and polished it up.</i>

411
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:40,556
<i>She; d take me for rides</i>
<i>in the hills above Sunset.</i>

412
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:43,605
<i>The whole thing</i>
<i>was upholstered in leopard skin,</i>

413
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:47,396
<i>and had one of those car phones,</i>
<i>all gold-plated.</i>

414
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:52,923
- That's a dreadful shirt.
- What's wrong with it?

415
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:59,356
Nothing, for work in a filling station.
I'm bored with that jacket and pants.

416
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:04,277
Max, what's the very best
man's shop in town?

417
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:08,486
I don't need any clothes and
I don't want you buying them for me.

418
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:12,879
Why begrudge me a little fun?
I just want you to look nice.

419
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:16,244
And must you chew gum?

420
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,638
There's nothing like
blue flannel for a man.

421
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:26,604
This one, single-breasted.

422
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:30,316
Now we need a topcoat.
Show me your camel's hair.

423
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:33,081
- Evening clothes?
- I don't need a tuxedo.

424
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:37,798
Of course you do. A tuxedo, tails
and, if you aren't careful, a cut-away.

425
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:41,516
- Tails, that's ridiculous!
- For parties and New Year's Eve.

426
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:45,362
- Where are your evening clothes?
- This way, madam.

427
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:51,876
Here are some camel's hair,
but feel this, it's vicuña.

428
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:56,484
- It's a little more expensive.
- The camel's hair will do.

429
00:35:57,487 --> 00:36:02,322
Well, as long as the lady's paying
for it, why not take the vicuña?

430
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:14,803
<i>The last week in December,</i>
<i>the rains came.</i>

431
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:21,281
<i>A great package of rain. Oversized</i>
<i>like everything else in California.</i>

432
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:26,316
<i>It came right through the old roof</i>
<i>of my room above the garage.</i>

433
00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:29,805
<i>She had Max move me</i>
<i>to the main house.</i>

434
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,356
<i>I didn; t much like the idea.</i>

435
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:36,236
<i>The only time</i>
<i>I had to myself was in that room.</i>

436
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:40,878
<i>But, it was better than sleeping</i>
<i>in a raincoat and galoshes.</i>

437
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:19,680
- Whose room was this?
- The room of the husband.

438
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:25,205
The husbands, I should say.
Madame's been married three times.

439
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:35,084
I guess that's the one you can see
Catalina from, only this isn't the day.

440
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:50,926
What's with the door?
There's no lock.

441
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:55,399
There are no locks
anywhere in this house, sir.

442
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:02,878
How come? There must be a reason.

443
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,607
- The doctor suggested it.
- What doctor?

444
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:10,716
Madame's doctor. Madame
has moments of melancholy.

445
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:14,436
There have been
some attempts at suicide.

446
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:18,316
We have to be very careful.
No sleeping pills, no razor blades.

447
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:22,002
We shut off the gas
in Madame's bedroom.

448
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:25,842
Why? Her career? She got enough
out of it. She's not forgotten.

449
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:32,401
- She still gets those fan letters.
- Don't look closely at the postmarks.

450
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:36,883
You send them. Is that it, Max?

451
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:39,641
I'd better press
your evening clothes, sir.

452
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:44,085
Mr Gillis has not forgotten
Madame's New Year's party?

453
00:38:44,247 --> 00:38:48,445
No, I haven't. I suppose
all the waxworks are coming?

454
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:53,442
I wouldn't know, sir.
Madame made the arrangements.

455
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,638
<i>There it was again.</i>

456
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:17,005
<i>That room of hers.</i>
<i>All satin and ruffles.</i>

457
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,761
<i>And that bed like a gilded rowboat.</i>

458
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:25,638
<i>The perfect setting</i>
<i>for a silent movie queen. Poor devil.</i>

459
00:39:25,807 --> 00:39:30,801
<i>Still waving proudly to a parade</i>
<i>which had long since passed her by.</i>

460
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:38,198
<i>It was at her New Year; s party that</i>
<i>I found out how she felt about me.</i>

461
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:41,962
<i>Maybe l; d been an idiot</i>
<i>not to have sensed it was coming.</i>

462
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:45,722
<i>That sad, embarrassing revelation.</i>

463
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:52,156
Joe!

464
00:39:56,447 --> 00:40:00,406
You look absolutely divine.
Turn around.

465
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,364
- Please!
- Come on.

466
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:06,315
Perfect! Wonderful shoulders,
and I love that line.

467
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,842
- It's padding, don't be fooled.
- Here.

468
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:12,439
Dressing up was always
just wearing my dark blue suit.

469
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:16,156
I don't like the stud.
I want you to have a luscious pearl.

470
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:18,443
I'm not going to wear earrings.

471
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:22,844
- Let's have a drink.
- Shouldn't we wait for the others?

472
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:24,440
Max, champagne.

473
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:28,439
Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.

474
00:40:30,247 --> 00:40:35,879
Here's to us! This floor
used to be wood, but I had it changed.

475
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:41,724
Valentino said, "There's nothing
like tile for a tango." Come on.

476
00:40:41,887 --> 00:40:46,324
- Not on the same floor with Valentino.
- Just follow me.

477
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:06,846
- Don't bend back like that.
- It's that thing, it tickles.

478
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,998
It does?

479
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:36,242
- It's 10.15. What time will they arrive?
- Who?

480
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:38,602
- The other guests.
- There aren't any.

481
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:43,283
We don't want to share this night
with others. This is for you and me.

482
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:46,200
- Oh?
- Hold me tighter.

483
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,686
OK.

484
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:54,485
Come midnight, how about
smashing glasses over Max's head?

485
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:58,162
- You think this is funny.
- A little.

486
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:08,279
<i>An hour dragged by.</i>

487
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:13,726
<i>I felt caught like the cigarette</i>
<i>in that contraption on her finger.</i>

488
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:22,161
What a wonderful next year
it's going to be. What fun we'll have.

489
00:42:22,327 --> 00:42:27,003
I'll fill the pool or open my Malibu
house and you can have the ocean.

490
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:31,763
When our picture's finished, I'll buy
you a boat and we'll sail to Hawaii...

491
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,838
You won't buy me anything more.

492
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:39,240
Don't be silly. Here. I was going
to give it to you at midnight.

493
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:43,403
I can't take it.
You've bought me enough.

494
00:42:43,567 --> 00:42:48,561
Shut up! I'm rich, richer than
all this new Hollywood trash.

495
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:50,445
I've got $1 million.

496
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:57,922
I own three blocks downtown, I've got
oil in Bakersfield pumping, pumping.

497
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:00,396
It's for buying us anything we want.

498
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:04,560
- Cut out that "us" business.
- What's the matter with you?

499
00:43:04,727 --> 00:43:08,117
What right do you have
to take me for granted?

500
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:11,120
What right? You want me to tell you?

501
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:18,326
Have you thought I may have a life
of my own, a girl I'm crazy about?

502
00:43:19,127 --> 00:43:22,642
Who? Some car-hop or dress extra?

503
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:25,241
I'm all wrong for you.

504
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:29,002
You want a Valentino, somebody
with polo ponies, a big shot.

505
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:35,606
What you're trying to say is you
don't want me to love you. Say it.

506
00:44:48,487 --> 00:44:52,924
<i>I didn; t know where I was going.</i>
<i>I just had to get out of there.</i>

507
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:58,957
<i>I had to be with people my own age.</i>
<i>I had to hear somebody laugh again.</i>

508
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:01,964
<i>I thought of Artie Green.</i>

509
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:06,518
<i>There had to be a New Year; s
<i>shindig in his apartment.</i>

510
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,396
<i>Writers without a job,</i>
<i>composers without a publisher,</i>

511
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:14,560
<i>actresses so young they still</i>
<i>believed the guys in the casting office.</i>

512
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:19,721
<i>A bunch of kids who didn; t give a hoot,</i>
<i>so long as they had a yuck to share.</i>

513
00:45:21,127 --> 00:45:25,200
<i>Hollywood for us ain; t been so good</i>
<i>Got no swimming pool</i>

514
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:32,079
<i>Very few clothes</i>
<i>All we earn are buttons and bows</i>

515
00:45:33,407 --> 00:45:34,965
- Hello, Joe.
- Tom.

516
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:38,199
- How are you?
- Hi, Joe.

517
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,726
- Whaddya know, Joe Gillis!
- Hi, Artie.

518
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:47,915
Where you been keeping that gorgeous
face? I almost reported you missing.

519
00:45:48,087 --> 00:45:51,796
You all know Joe Gillis, the famous
screenwriter, uranium smuggler,

520
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:54,276
and Black Dahlia suspect.

521
00:45:55,247 --> 00:45:57,522
- Give me your coat.
- Let it ride.

522
00:45:57,687 --> 00:45:59,917
- You are going to stay?
- Yes.

523
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:03,796
Then come on. What is this, mink?

524
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:10,362
Judas H Priest, who'd you borrow
that from? Adolphe Menjou?

525
00:46:10,527 --> 00:46:13,678
- Close, but no cigar.
- You're not really a smuggler?

526
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:16,361
- Where's the bar?
- Come on.

527
00:46:19,127 --> 00:46:20,640
- Good party.
- The greatest.

528
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:23,446
They call me the Elsa Maxwell
of the assistant directors.

529
00:46:23,607 --> 00:46:28,237
Go easy on that punchbowl. Budget
only calls for three drinks per extra.

530
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:31,524
- Fake the rest.
- Can I stick around a while?

531
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:35,316
- Sure. This'll go on all night.
- No, I mean a couple of weeks?

532
00:46:35,487 --> 00:46:38,160
- We've a vacancy on the couch.
- I'll take it.

533
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:43,606
I'll have the bellhop take care
of your luggage. Just register it here.

534
00:46:45,007 --> 00:46:46,963
- Hello, Mr Gillis.
- Hello.

535
00:46:47,127 --> 00:46:50,802
- You know each other?
- Betty Schaefer, Sheldrake's office.

536
00:46:50,967 --> 00:46:53,527
- Sure, "Bases Loaded".
- Wait.

537
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:56,440
This is the woman I love.
What's going on?

538
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:58,916
She's a fan for my literary output.

539
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:01,647
- Hurt feelings department.
- Where's the phone?

540
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:04,196
Over by the rainbow room.

541
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:16,676
When you're through
with that thing, can I have it?

542
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:22,804
- Hey, you forgot this.
- Thanks.

543
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:27,802
- I've been hoping to run into you.
- To recover your knife in my back?

544
00:47:27,967 --> 00:47:30,959
I felt guilty, so I got out
some of your old stories.

545
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:35,245
- You sweet kid.
- One's called something "Window".

546
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:40,162
- "Dark Windows". How'd you like it?
- I didn't, except for about six pages.

547
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:42,795
You've got a flashback there...

548
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:45,527
Is there someplace we can talk?

549
00:47:45,687 --> 00:47:48,281
How about the rainbow room?

550
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:52,686
Joe, I said you could
have my couch, not my girl.

551
00:47:52,847 --> 00:47:54,758
This is shop talk.

552
00:47:55,727 --> 00:47:59,720
There's a short stretch of my fiction
you found worthy of notice?

553
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:02,959
The flashback scene when she tells
about being a schoolteacher.

554
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:06,483
- I had a teacher like that.
- Maybe that's why it's good.

555
00:48:06,647 --> 00:48:10,481
- It's true and moving. Why not?
- Who wants true and moving?

556
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:13,320
Drop that attitude.
It's something worthwhile.

557
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:16,718
- Shall I start now?
- Seriously. I've got ideas.

558
00:48:16,887 --> 00:48:21,244
I've got some, too.
This is New Year's Eve, let's live it up.

559
00:48:21,407 --> 00:48:25,685
For instance? We could make some
paper boats and have a regatta.

560
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:29,806
- Or turn on the shower full blast.
- Or capture the kitchen.

561
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:32,401
- Are you hungry?
- Hungry?

562
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:36,640
After twelve years in the Burmese
jungle, I'm starving, Lady Agatha...

563
00:48:36,807 --> 00:48:40,402
...starving for a white shoulder.
- Phillip, you're mad.

564
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:44,606
Thirsting for the coolness of your lips.

565
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,084
You can have the phone now.

566
00:48:48,647 --> 00:48:50,842
No, Phillip, we must be strong.

567
00:48:51,007 --> 00:48:53,077
You're still wearing
the Coldstream Guards uniform,

568
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,045
furthermore,
you can have the phone now.

569
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:58,323
OK.

570
00:48:58,487 --> 00:49:00,876
Suddenly
I'm terribly afraid of losing you.

571
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:04,437
You won't. I'll get us a refill
of this horrible liquid.

572
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:08,395
- You'll be waiting for me?
- With a wildly beating heart.

573
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:12,446
Life can be beautiful.

574
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:33,046
Hello, Max. I need a favour.

575
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:36,367
I'm sorry, I cannot talk now.

576
00:49:36,527 --> 00:49:42,124
Yes, you can. Put my old clothes
and my typewriter in my suitcase.

577
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:47,486
- I'll have somebody pick them up.
- I've no time. The doctor is here.

578
00:49:48,607 --> 00:49:50,484
What doctor? What's going on?

579
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:54,799
Madame got the razor
from your room and cut her wrists.

580
00:49:54,967 --> 00:49:58,482
What? Max! Max!

581
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:10,320
I got the recipe.

582
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:15,561
Two packages of cough drops
dissolved in warm grape juice...

583
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:23,485
Hey, Joe!

584
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:33,323
Happy New Year!

585
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,245
- How is she?
- She's in her room.

586
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:45,527
Be careful, don't race upstairs.
The musicians mustn't know.

587
00:51:27,807 --> 00:51:29,923
Go away.

588
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:41,202
What silly thing was that to do?

589
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:45,326
To fall in love
with you was the idiotic thing.

590
00:51:46,487 --> 00:51:49,240
Sure would've
made attractive headlines.

591
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:51,762
"Great star kills herself
for unknown writer."

592
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:56,799
Great stars have great pride.

593
00:52:01,087 --> 00:52:05,399
Go away. Go to that girl of yours.

594
00:52:09,487 --> 00:52:12,160
Look, I was making that up,

595
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:16,002
because I thought
the whole thing was a mistake.

596
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:19,956
I didn't want to hurt you.
You've been good to me.

597
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:23,802
You're the only person
in this stinking town that has.

598
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:27,198
Just say thank you and go.
Go, go!

599
00:52:27,367 --> 00:52:31,758
Not until you promise to act
like a sensible human being.

600
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:34,999
I'll do it again. I'll do it again!

601
00:52:37,047 --> 00:52:40,084
I'll do it again.

602
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:31,282
Happy New Year, Norma.

603
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:44,637
Happy New Year, darling.

604
00:54:00,727 --> 00:54:05,278
- Hello.
- Is this Crest View 51733?

605
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:09,645
I'm sorry to bother you again,
but I must speak to Mr Gillis.

606
00:54:09,807 --> 00:54:13,004
- He's not here.
- Where can I reach him?

607
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:17,922
- Maybe somebody else could tell me.
- Nobody can give you any information.

608
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:21,875
And you will please not call again.

609
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:25,202
Max!

610
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:29,957
Who was it, Max? What is it?

611
00:54:30,927 --> 00:54:35,842
Nothing, Madame. Somebody
enquiring about a stray dog.

612
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:39,636
Our number must be similar
to the number of the pound.

613
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:44,605
Wait. Get the car out
and take the script to Paramount.

614
00:54:44,767 --> 00:54:48,362
- Deliver it to Mr DeMille in person.
- Very good.

615
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:57,516
- You're sending it to DeMille?
- Yes. This is the day.

616
00:54:57,687 --> 00:55:00,759
My astrologer read
DeMille's horoscope and mine.

617
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:03,441
- She read the script?
- DeMille's Leo, I'm Scorpio.

618
00:55:03,607 --> 00:55:05,677
Mars has been transiting
Jupiter for weeks.

619
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:09,681
Today is the day
of the greatest conjunction.

620
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:12,805
Turn around, darling. Let me dry you.

621
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:18,317
I hope you realise scripts don't sell
on astrologers' charts.

622
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:20,557
It's not the script, I'm selling me.

623
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:23,400
DeMille always said
I was his greatest star.

624
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:26,240
When did he say it, Norma?

625
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:31,276
All right, it was quite a few years ago.
But I've never looked better in my life.

626
00:55:31,447 --> 00:55:36,840
You know why? Because
I've never been as happy in my life.

627
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:44,556
<i>A few evenings later, we were visiting</i>
<i>one of the waxworks for bridge.</i>

628
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:50,165
<i>She; d taught me bridge by then, just</i>
<i>as she; d taught me fancy tango steps,</i>

629
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:54,320
<i>and what wine to drink with what fish.</i>

630
00:55:55,287 --> 00:55:58,643
That idiot! He forgot
to fill my cigarette case.

631
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:03,278
- Have one of mine.
- They're dreadful and make me cough.

632
00:56:06,007 --> 00:56:09,079
Pull up at the drugstore.
I'll get you some.

633
00:56:09,247 --> 00:56:11,761
You're a darling.

634
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:36,204
Give me a package of those
Turkish cigarettes... Abdullas.

635
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:41,361
Stick 'em up, Gillis,
or I'll let you have it.

636
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:44,439
Hi, Artie. Evening, Miss Schaefer.

637
00:56:44,607 --> 00:56:48,566
- I'm so glad to see you.
- You walked out on the mob?

638
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:52,322
Sorry about New Year's. Would you
believe I stayed with a sick friend?

639
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:55,684
Someone in the formal set,
with a ten-carat kidney stone?

640
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:58,805
Stop it. Where've you been
keeping yourself?

641
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:04,121
- I've got wonderful news for you.
- I haven't been keeping myself at all.

642
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,755
I called your agent,
the Screenwriters' Guild.

643
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:09,077
Your apartment gave me
a Crest View number.

644
00:57:09,247 --> 00:57:13,206
There was someone with an accent
growling: you weren't there,

645
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:14,959
they never heard of you.

646
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:17,800
Is that so?
What's the wonderful news?

647
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:20,720
- Sheldrake likes the teacher angle.
- What teacher?

648
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:24,402
"Dark Windows". He thinks
it could be made into something.

649
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,479
- Where's the cash?
- Where's the story?

650
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:30,320
I bluffed it out with a few notions.

651
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:32,398
- But it needs work.
- I feared so.

652
00:57:32,567 --> 00:57:35,479
I've got 20 pages
and a good male character.

653
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:38,684
Write plenty of background
so they'll need an extra director.

654
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:42,157
Shut up.
If we could get a story...

655
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:45,205
I've given up writing on spec.

656
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:49,042
- But this is half sold.
- In fact, I've given up writing.

657
00:57:49,207 --> 00:57:54,804
- Mr Gillis, if you please?
- I'll be right there.

658
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:58,277
The accent! This guy's in the pay
of a foreign government.

659
00:57:58,447 --> 00:58:01,359
- Check those studs and cufflinks.
- I must go.

660
00:58:01,527 --> 00:58:05,440
- Thanks for the interest in my career.
- It's not yours, it's mine.

661
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,598
I'd hoped to get in on this deal.

662
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:10,839
I don't want to be a reader.
I want to write.

663
00:58:11,007 --> 00:58:14,158
- I'm sorry if I crossed you up.
- You sure have.

664
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:16,363
So long.

665
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:30,040
- It took you hours.
- I ran into some people I know.

666
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,961
- Where are my cigarettes?
- Where are your?

667
00:58:35,047 --> 00:58:37,607
Norma, you're smoking too much.

668
00:58:40,287 --> 00:58:43,120
<i>Whenever she suspected</i>
<i>I was getting bored,</i>

669
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:45,721
<i>she; d put on a live show for me.</i>

670
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,196
<i>The Norma Desmond Follies.</i>

671
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:52,440
<i>Her first number was always</i>
<i>the Mack Sennett Bathing Beauty.</i>

672
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:05,003
I can still see myself in the line:
Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand.

673
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,556
Mabel was always
stepping on my feet.

674
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:11,276
What's the matter?
Why are you so glum?

675
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:15,281
Nothing's the matter. I'm having
a great time. Show me some more.

676
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:21,886
All right. Give me this. I need it for
a moustache. Now, close your eyes.

677
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:30,446
<i>Something was the matter all right.</i>

678
00:59:30,607 --> 00:59:35,123
<i>I was thinking about that girl</i>
<i>of Artie; s, that Miss Schaefer.</i>

679
00:59:35,287 --> 00:59:38,836
<i>She was like all writers</i>
<i>when we first hit Hollywood,</i>

680
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:42,886
<i>itching with ambition,</i>
<i>planning to get your names up there:</i>

681
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:47,245
<i>; ; Screenplay by; ;, ; ; Original story by;; .

682
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:52,926
<i>Audiences don; t know somebody</i>
<i>sits down and writes a picture.</i>

683
00:59:53,087 --> 00:59:56,477
<i>They think the actors</i>
<i>make it up as they go.</i>

684
00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:59,923
Open your eyes.

685
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:34,802
- Madame's wanted on the telephone.
- Don't interrupt me.

686
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:36,844
- Paramount's calling.
- Who?

687
01:00:37,007 --> 01:00:39,601
Paramount Studios.

688
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:43,442
Now do you believe me?
I told you DeMille would jump at it.

689
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:47,646
It is not Mr DeMille in person,
it's someone named Gordon Cole.

690
01:00:47,807 --> 01:00:50,560
- He says it's very important.
- Certainly it is.

691
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:52,718
Important enough for Mr DeMille
to call me personally.

692
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:57,517
The idea of having some assistant
call me! Say I'm busy and hang up.

693
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,042
Very good, Madame.

694
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:08,717
How do you like that?
We've made 12 pictures together.

695
01:01:08,887 --> 01:01:10,764
His greatest successes!

696
01:01:10,927 --> 01:01:13,999
- Maybe he's busy shooting.
- I know that trick!

697
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:17,477
He's trying to belittle me,
to get my price down.

698
01:01:17,647 --> 01:01:23,119
I've waited 20 years for this.
DeMille can wait till I'm good and ready.

699
01:01:26,727 --> 01:01:29,958
<i>About three days later,</i>
<i>she was good and ready.</i>

700
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:32,516
<i>Incredibly, there; d been some more</i>

701
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:35,645
<i>of those urgent calls</i>
<i>from Paramount.</i>

702
01:01:35,807 --> 01:01:40,039
<i>So she put on about half a pound</i>
<i>of make-up, fixed it up with a veil,</i>

703
01:01:40,207 --> 01:01:43,597
<i>and set forth</i>
<i>to see DeMille in person.</i>

704
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:51,124
Madame will pardon me, the shadow
over the left eye is not quite balanced.

705
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,562
Thank you, Max.

706
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:09,726
Hold that noise!

707
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:13,876
- Hey!
- To see Mr DeMille, open the gate.

708
01:02:14,047 --> 01:02:16,402
He's shooting. Got an appointment?

709
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,444
No appointment necessary.

710
01:02:18,607 --> 01:02:21,838
- I'm bringing Norma Desmond.
- Norma who?

711
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:26,319
- Norma Desmond.
- Jonesy, hey, Jonesy.

712
01:02:26,487 --> 01:02:31,607
Yeah? Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond!

713
01:02:31,767 --> 01:02:34,804
- How've you been, Miss Desmond?
- Open the gate.

714
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:39,040
- Sure, Miss Desmond. Come on.
- They can't enter without a pass.

715
01:02:39,207 --> 01:02:42,279
Miss Desmond can. Come on.

716
01:02:51,207 --> 01:02:53,675
- Where's Mr DeMille shooting?
- Stage 18.

717
01:02:53,847 --> 01:02:56,998
Thank you, Jonesy.
And teach your friend some manners.

718
01:02:57,167 --> 01:03:00,876
Without me he'd have no job,
because there'd be no Paramount.

719
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:05,325
- You're right, Miss Desmond.
- Go on, Max.

720
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,726
Stage 18.

721
01:03:14,647 --> 01:03:20,677
<i>All right, notify Henry Wilcoxon.</i>
<i>Spread that out so I can see it.</i>

722
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:24,637
<i>Keep quiet back there!</i>

723
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:27,640
Norma Desmond's
coming to see Mr DeMille.

724
01:03:27,807 --> 01:03:32,085
<i>Hit that with a light, somebody,</i>
<i>so I can get a look at that scape.</i>

725
01:03:32,247 --> 01:03:36,684
<i>Back up a little. Get out of the way!</i>
<i>You fellow at the back.</i>

726
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:38,917
Norma Desmond's
coming to see Mr DeMille.

727
01:03:39,087 --> 01:03:41,476
Norma Desmond?

728
01:03:42,247 --> 01:03:44,966
- Wait a minute.
- Harry Wilcoxon?

729
01:03:45,127 --> 01:03:49,757
Draw your sword and raise that drape
with it. Samson's lying over here.

730
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:53,317
Norma Desmond's coming in
to see you, Mr DeMille.

731
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:57,036
- Norma Desmond?
- She must be a million years old.

732
01:03:57,207 --> 01:04:00,563
Where does that put me?
I could be her father.

733
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:05,642
- Sorry, Mr DeMille.
- It must be about her awful script.

734
01:04:05,807 --> 01:04:07,957
What can I tell her?

735
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:12,245
I can tell her you're in the projection
room, give her the brush.

736
01:04:12,407 --> 01:04:15,638
Thirty million fans gave her
the brush. Isn't that enough?

737
01:04:15,807 --> 01:04:18,002
- I didn't mean...
- Of course not.

738
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:22,160
You didn't know Norma Desmond
as a lovely girl of 17,

739
01:04:22,327 --> 01:04:26,923
with more courage and wit and heart
than ever in one youngster.

740
01:04:27,087 --> 01:04:31,285
- I hear she was a terror to work with.
- Only toward the end.

741
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:34,837
A dozen press agents
working overtime

742
01:04:35,007 --> 01:04:38,795
can do terrible things
to the human spirit.

743
01:04:39,767 --> 01:04:41,405
Hold it.

744
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:50,961
- Don't you want to come along?
- It's your script, your show.

745
01:04:51,127 --> 01:04:54,005
- Good luck.
- Thank you, dearest.

746
01:04:56,967 --> 01:04:58,844
Well, hello, young fellow.

747
01:04:59,007 --> 01:05:01,965
- Hello, Mr DeMille.
- Good to see you.

748
01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:04,561
I saw you last someplace very gay.

749
01:05:04,727 --> 01:05:07,287
I remember I was dancing on a table.

750
01:05:07,447 --> 01:05:12,885
A lot of people were. Lindbergh
had just landed in Paris. Come on in.

751
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:17,998
Norma, I must apologise
for not calling you.

752
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:19,759
You'd better, I'm very angry.

753
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:23,237
- You can see I'm terribly busy.
- That's no excuse.

754
01:05:23,407 --> 01:05:26,797
- You read the script, of course?
- Yes.

755
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:31,119
You could've called me yourself,
instead of leaving it to an assistant.

756
01:05:31,287 --> 01:05:36,202
- What assistant?
- Don't play innocent. Gordon Cole.

757
01:05:36,367 --> 01:05:37,686
Gordon Cole?

758
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:40,236
If you hadn't been pretty interested,

759
01:05:40,407 --> 01:05:45,606
he wouldn't have tried to get me
on the telephone ten times.

760
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:47,997
I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.

761
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:52,399
Why don't you sit in my chair
and make yourself comfortable?

762
01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:57,357
- Thank you.
- That's the girl. I won't be a moment.

763
01:05:57,527 --> 01:06:01,520
Bring me a telephone
and get me Gordon Cole.

764
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:18,964
Hey, Miss Desmond.

765
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:26,445
- Miss Desmond, it's me, Hog-eye.
- Hello, Hog-eye.

766
01:06:29,127 --> 01:06:32,164
Let's get a good look at you.

767
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:36,118
Look, there's Norma Desmond.

768
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:38,926
Norma Desmond!

769
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:41,521
- Norma Desmond!
- I thought she was dead.

770
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:45,202
- How nice to see you!
- Welcome home. Remember me?

771
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:48,677
Of course I do. Hello, Patsy.

772
01:06:48,847 --> 01:06:52,522
- Have you met Miss Desmond?
- It's a great pleasure.

773
01:06:52,687 --> 01:06:56,919
Gordon, this is C B DeMille. Have
you been calling Norma Desmond?

774
01:06:57,087 --> 01:07:01,205
Yes, Mr DeMille. It's that car of hers,
an old Isotta Fraschini.

775
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:05,042
Her chauffeur drove it here the other
day. It's perfect for the Crosby picture.

776
01:07:05,207 --> 01:07:10,406
- We want to rent it for two weeks.
- Oh, I see.

777
01:07:10,567 --> 01:07:13,525
Well, thank you very much,
thank you.

778
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:32,484
Hog-eye,
turn that light back where it belongs.

779
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:49,203
Well, I got hold of Gordon Cole.

780
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:51,801
Did you see how they came?

781
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:56,597
You know, some crazy things
happen in this business, Norma.

782
01:07:56,767 --> 01:08:00,601
I hope you haven't lost
your sense of humour.

783
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:03,281
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

784
01:08:03,447 --> 01:08:07,281
I didn't realise what it would be like
coming back to the studio.

785
01:08:07,447 --> 01:08:11,122
- I'd no idea how much I missed it.
- We've missed you, too.

786
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:14,279
We'll be working again.
We'll make our greatest picture.

787
01:08:14,447 --> 01:08:17,917
- I want to talk to you about that.
- Isn't it a good script?

788
01:08:18,087 --> 01:08:23,719
It has some good things in it, but
it would be a very expensive picture.

789
01:08:23,887 --> 01:08:25,684
I don't care.

790
01:08:25,847 --> 01:08:30,159
I want to work again. You don't know
what it means knowing you want me.

791
01:08:30,327 --> 01:08:34,115
Nothing would please me more
if it were possible.

792
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:38,041
Remember, I don't work before
10 a.m. and never after 4.30 p.m.

793
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:41,998
- We're ready, Mr DeMille.
- All right.

794
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:49,164
Why don't you sit here and watch?
Pictures have changed quite a bit.

795
01:08:49,327 --> 01:08:51,397
All right, let's go.

796
01:08:51,767 --> 01:08:53,883
Hit 'em all.

797
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:58,443
Roll 'em. Speed.

798
01:09:06,807 --> 01:09:10,004
You see those offices there, Mr Gillis?

799
01:09:11,127 --> 01:09:15,200
They used to be Madame's
dressing-room. The whole row.

800
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:17,517
That didn't leave much
for Wallace Reid.

801
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:20,599
He had a great
big bungalow on wheels.

802
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:25,887
I had the upstairs. You see where it
says "Readers Department"?

803
01:09:26,047 --> 01:09:30,962
I remember my walls were
covered with black patent leather.

804
01:09:38,327 --> 01:09:41,080
I'll be with you in a minute.

805
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:56,803
Here's that funny car Cole was
talking about. Can we look it over?

806
01:09:56,967 --> 01:09:59,640
What's so funny about it?

807
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:10,277
If there's anything in "Dark Windows"
you can use, take it, it's all yours.

808
01:10:10,447 --> 01:10:13,325
For heaven's sakes!
Come in, have a chair.

809
01:10:13,487 --> 01:10:17,275
- I mean it. Help yourself.
- Why should you do that?

810
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:21,565
You get $100,000, buy me chocolates;
an Oscar, I get the left foot.

811
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:25,561
I would do that, but I'm not
good enough to do it alone.

812
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:29,800
- What about those ideas you had?
- See if they make sense.

813
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:34,324
First, throw out all that psychological
mess, exploring the killer's sick mind.

814
01:10:34,847 --> 01:10:36,565
Psychopaths sell like hot cakes.

815
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:39,639
This is a story about teachers,
their threadbare lives.

816
01:10:39,807 --> 01:10:43,038
She teaches day classes
while he teaches night school.

817
01:10:43,207 --> 01:10:45,004
The first time they meet...

818
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:48,045
- I haven't time to listen.
- I'll make it short.

819
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:51,040
- It's your baby.
- Couldn't we work evenings?

820
01:10:51,207 --> 01:10:54,722
Six in the morning? This month
I'm completely at your disposal.

821
01:10:54,887 --> 01:10:57,845
- Artie's out of town.
- What's Artie to do with it?

822
01:10:58,007 --> 01:11:01,716
- We're engaged.
- Good for you.

823
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,401
- You couldn't find a nicer guy.
- I agree.

824
01:11:04,567 --> 01:11:07,320
They're on location in Arizona
making a Western.

825
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:12,515
I'm free every evening and weekend.
We could work at your place.

826
01:11:12,687 --> 01:11:16,885
It can't be done. Stop being
chicken-hearted and write that story.

827
01:11:17,047 --> 01:11:19,925
- I hate you.
- Don't make it too dreary.

828
01:11:20,087 --> 01:11:23,682
How about this? She teaches
daytimes, he teaches at night.

829
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:27,476
They don't know each other
but share a room. It's cheaper.

830
01:11:27,647 --> 01:11:31,765
They sleep in the same bed.
In shifts, of course.

831
01:11:31,927 --> 01:11:34,760
Are you kidding? I think it's good.

832
01:11:34,927 --> 01:11:37,919
- So do I.
- Let me show you where it fits in.

833
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:40,999
- So long.
- Oh, you...

834
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,446
What?

835
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:51,520
I found out the reason for those
telephone calls from Paramount.

836
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:55,566
It's not Madame they want,
it's her car they want to rent.

837
01:11:55,727 --> 01:11:57,843
What?

838
01:12:00,007 --> 01:12:03,124
Goodbye, Norma.
We'll see what we can do.

839
01:12:03,287 --> 01:12:07,917
I'm not worried. The old team
together again. Nothing can stop us.

840
01:12:08,087 --> 01:12:11,124
The old team? Yeah.

841
01:12:12,167 --> 01:12:15,159
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Mr DeMille.

842
01:12:23,287 --> 01:12:26,484
- How'd it go?
- It couldn't have gone better.

843
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:30,162
He has to finish this picture first.
Mine will be next.

844
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:36,125
Get Gordon Cole.
Tell him to forget about her car.

845
01:12:36,287 --> 01:12:39,006
Say he can get
another old car someplace.

846
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:42,443
I'll buy him five old cars if necessary.

847
01:12:48,887 --> 01:12:51,355
<i>After that, an army of beauty experts</i>

848
01:12:51,527 --> 01:12:54,644
<i>invaded her house</i>
<i>on Sunset Boulevard.</i>

849
01:12:54,807 --> 01:12:57,765
<i>She went through</i>
<i>a merciless series of treatments.</i>

850
01:12:57,927 --> 01:13:01,681
<i>Like an athlete training for the Olympics,</i>
<i>she counted every calorie,</i>

851
01:13:01,847 --> 01:13:04,077
<i>went to bed every night at nine.</i>

852
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:07,444
<i>She was absolutely</i>
<i>determined to be ready,</i>

853
01:13:07,607 --> 01:13:10,644
<i>ready for those cameras</i>
<i>that would never turn.</i>

854
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:48,076
- Darling, are you there?
- Yes.

855
01:13:48,247 --> 01:13:52,638
Don't turn around.
Keep your eyes on the book.

856
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:57,202
I just came to say goodnight.
You mustn't see me.

857
01:13:57,367 --> 01:14:00,245
- I'm not very attractive.
- Goodnight.

858
01:14:00,407 --> 01:14:03,160
- I've lost half a pound.
- Good.

859
01:14:03,327 --> 01:14:07,036
I was worried about my throat.
This woman's done wonders.

860
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:11,803
- Good.
- You'd better get to bed yourself.

861
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:17,803
- I think I'll read a little longer.
- You went out last night, didn't you?

862
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:20,401
- Why do you say that?
- I know.

863
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:24,799
I had a nightmare and screamed
for you. Where were you?

864
01:14:24,967 --> 01:14:29,438
- I went for a walk.
- No, you didn't. You took the car.

865
01:14:29,607 --> 01:14:34,635
I drove to the beach. You don't
want me to feel I'm locked up here?

866
01:14:34,807 --> 01:14:38,641
Of course not.
I just don't want to be left alone.

867
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:42,800
Not while I'm under this strain.
My nerves are torn to shreds.

868
01:14:42,967 --> 01:14:47,643
All I ask is for you to be
a little patient and a little kind.

869
01:14:48,927 --> 01:14:53,205
- I haven't done anything.
- Of course you haven't.

870
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:57,042
I wouldn't let you. Goodnight, darling.

871
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:29,677
<i>Yes, I was playing hookey</i>
<i>every evening along in there.</i>

872
01:15:29,847 --> 01:15:35,604
<i>It reminded me of being twelve,</i>
<i>sneaking out to see a gangster film.</i>

873
01:15:35,767 --> 01:15:40,716
<i>This time, it wasn; t to see a picture,</i>
<i>it was to try and write one.</i>

874
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:42,798
<i>That story Betty Schaefer dug up</i>

875
01:15:42,967 --> 01:15:46,960
<i>kept going through my head</i>
<i>like a dozen locomotives.</i>

876
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:52,520
<i>So we started working on it,</i>
<i>nights when the studio was deserted,</i>

877
01:15:52,687 --> 01:15:55,759
<i>up in her little cubby-hole of an office.</i>

878
01:16:10,727 --> 01:16:13,002
I got the funniest letter from Artie.

879
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:15,886
It's rained every day
since they got there.

880
01:16:16,047 --> 01:16:19,722
They rewrote the whole picture
for rain and shot half.

881
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:23,359
Now the sun's out,
nobody knows when they'll get back.

882
01:16:23,527 --> 01:16:27,440
- Good.
- Why good? I miss him terribly.

883
01:16:27,607 --> 01:16:30,804
- I mean this good dialogue will play.
- It will?

884
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:35,119
Sure, especially with lots of music
drowning it out.

885
01:16:35,287 --> 01:16:39,439
- Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
- Constantly.

886
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:42,405
In all seriousness, this is really good.

887
01:16:42,567 --> 01:16:46,321
- It's fun writing with you.
- Oh, thanks.

888
01:16:59,647 --> 01:17:03,845
- Who's Norma?
- Who's who?

889
01:17:04,007 --> 01:17:07,238
I'm sorry, I don't usually read
private cigarette cases.

890
01:17:07,407 --> 01:17:11,764
Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine.

891
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:15,283
A middle-aged lady,
very foolish and very generous.

892
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:17,517
I'll say, this is solid gold.

893
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:20,281
I gave her advice on an idiotic script.

894
01:17:20,447 --> 01:17:24,645
The old familiar story. You help
a timid soul across a crowded street.

895
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:29,039
She turns out to be a multi-millionaire
and leaves you all her money.

896
01:17:29,207 --> 01:17:32,438
That's the trouble with you readers.
You know all the plots.

897
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:36,316
Now suppose you proofread
page ten while the water boils, OK?

898
01:17:36,487 --> 01:17:38,842
OK.

899
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:03,319
<i>Sometimes when we got stuck,</i>

900
01:18:03,487 --> 01:18:06,320
<i>we; d make a little tour</i>
<i>of the drowsing lot.</i>

901
01:18:06,487 --> 01:18:11,845
<i>Not talking much, just wandering</i>
<i>down alleys between the stages,</i>

902
01:18:12,007 --> 01:18:16,046
<i>or through the sets they were getting</i>
<i>ready for the next day; s shooting.</i>

903
01:18:16,207 --> 01:18:21,361
<i>In fact, it was on one of those walks</i>
<i>when she told me about her nose.</i>

904
01:18:21,527 --> 01:18:23,279
Look at this street.

905
01:18:23,447 --> 01:18:27,759
All cardboard, all hollow,
all phoney, all done with mirrors.

906
01:18:27,927 --> 01:18:31,761
I like it better
than any street in the world.

907
01:18:31,927 --> 01:18:35,761
Maybe because
I used to play here when I was a kid.

908
01:18:35,927 --> 01:18:37,963
Were you a child actress?

909
01:18:38,127 --> 01:18:42,803
No, I was born two blocks from
the studio, Lemon Grove Avenue.

910
01:18:42,967 --> 01:18:46,516
My father was head electrician here.
Mother still works in wardrobe.

911
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:48,917
- Second generation, huh?
- Third.

912
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,682
Grandma did stunt work for Pearl
White. I'm from a picture family.

913
01:18:52,847 --> 01:18:54,997
They expected me to become a star.

914
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:59,285
So I had ten years of dramatic
lessons, diction, dancing.

915
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:03,235
Then the studio made a test.
They didn't like my nose.

916
01:19:03,407 --> 01:19:06,797
Slanted this way a little.
So I had it fixed.

917
01:19:06,967 --> 01:19:10,926
Then they loved my nose,
only they didn't like my acting.

918
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:18,806
- Nice job.
- It should be, it cost $300.

919
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:21,197
- That's sad.
- Not at all.

920
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:25,519
It taught me sense. I worked up
from the mail room to being reader.

921
01:19:25,687 --> 01:19:29,965
Come clean. At night you weep
for the lost close-ups, those galas.

922
01:19:30,127 --> 01:19:33,836
Not once. What's wrong with being
the other side of the cameras?

923
01:19:34,007 --> 01:19:37,841
- It's really more fun.
- Three cheers for Betty Schaefer.

924
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:43,923
- I will now kiss that nose of yours.
- If you please.

925
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:48,406
May I say that you smell real special?

926
01:19:48,567 --> 01:19:53,846
- Must be my new shampoo.
- That's no shampoo.

927
01:19:54,007 --> 01:19:57,204
It's more like freshly laundered
linen handkerchiefs,

928
01:19:57,367 --> 01:20:00,325
like a brand-new automobile.

929
01:20:00,487 --> 01:20:04,002
- How old are you?
- 22.

930
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:09,195
Smart girl. Nothing like being 22.

931
01:20:09,367 --> 01:20:15,203
May I suggest, if we're ever to finish
this story, stay at least two feet away.

932
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:18,325
The first time
you see me coming any closer,

933
01:20:18,487 --> 01:20:21,638
clunk me on the head with a shoe.

934
01:20:21,807 --> 01:20:27,279
Now, back to the typewriters,
by way of Washington Square.

935
01:21:10,207 --> 01:21:14,758
What is it, Max?
Want to wash the car?

936
01:21:14,927 --> 01:21:17,805
Or are you spying in your off hours?

937
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:22,643
Be careful as you cross the patio.
Madame may be watching.

938
01:21:22,807 --> 01:21:26,766
How about going up the kitchen stairs
and undressing in the dark?

939
01:21:26,927 --> 01:21:29,680
I'm not enquiring
where Mr Gillis goes every night.

940
01:21:29,847 --> 01:21:35,444
Why don't you? I'm writing a script
and I'm going to finish it!

941
01:21:35,607 --> 01:21:39,759
It's just that I am greatly
worried about Madame.

942
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:43,442
Sure you are.
And we're not helping her any.

943
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:48,123
Feeding her lies and more lies,
getting herself ready for a picture.

944
01:21:48,287 --> 01:21:52,803
- What happens when she finds out?
- She never will.

945
01:21:52,967 --> 01:21:57,199
That is my job
and it has been for a long time.

946
01:21:57,367 --> 01:22:03,237
Understand, I discovered her when
she was sixteen. I made her a star.

947
01:22:03,407 --> 01:22:07,161
I cannot let her be destroyed.

948
01:22:07,327 --> 01:22:13,277
- You made her a star?
- Yes, I directed all her early films.

949
01:22:13,447 --> 01:22:17,201
There were three young directors
who showed promise in those days.

950
01:22:17,367 --> 01:22:22,646
D W Griffith, Cecil B DeMille
and Max Von Mayerling.

951
01:22:24,527 --> 01:22:26,677
And she's turned you into a servant.

952
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:31,079
It was I who asked to come back,
humiliating as it may seem.

953
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:33,841
I could've continued my career,

954
01:22:34,007 --> 01:22:38,956
only I found everything
unendurable after she'd left me.

955
01:22:39,127 --> 01:22:43,882
You see, I was her first husband.

956
01:23:09,847 --> 01:23:12,407
You're here, Joe.

957
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:15,243
When did you come home?

958
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:24,282
Oh, Joe, where were you?
Is it a woman?

959
01:23:24,447 --> 01:23:28,884
I know it's a woman. Who is she?
Why can't I ask you?

960
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:32,039
I must know.

961
01:24:22,887 --> 01:24:25,196
What's the matter?

962
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:32,242
Betty, wake up.
Why are you staring at me like that?

963
01:24:32,407 --> 01:24:35,319
Oh, was I? I'm sorry.

964
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,955
What's wrong with you tonight?

965
01:24:38,127 --> 01:24:40,721
- What is it?
- Something came up.

966
01:24:40,887 --> 01:24:44,721
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Why not?

967
01:24:50,807 --> 01:24:53,321
I just don't.

968
01:25:00,407 --> 01:25:05,197
What have you heard?
Come on, let's have it.

969
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:08,837
Is it about me?

970
01:25:19,687 --> 01:25:24,681
Betty, there's no use running out on it.
Let's face it, whatever it is.

971
01:25:24,847 --> 01:25:31,036
- I got a telegram from Artie.
- From Artie? What's wrong?

972
01:25:31,207 --> 01:25:33,960
He wants me to come on to Arizona.

973
01:25:34,127 --> 01:25:38,723
He says it only costs two dollars
to get married there.

974
01:25:38,887 --> 01:25:41,606
It would save us a honeymoon.

975
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:47,125
Why don't you? We can finish
the script by Thursday.

976
01:25:47,287 --> 01:25:50,643
Stop crying. You're getting married.
That's what you wanted.

977
01:25:50,807 --> 01:25:53,765
I don't want it now.

978
01:25:53,927 --> 01:26:00,400
- Why not, don't you love Artie?
- Course I love him. I always will.

979
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:05,402
I'm not in love with him
any more, that's all.

980
01:26:05,567 --> 01:26:07,637
What happened?

981
01:26:08,527 --> 01:26:11,041
You did.

982
01:26:22,807 --> 01:26:25,799
<i>It wasn; t until I got back</i>
<i>to my peculiar prison</i>

983
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:29,118
<i>that I started facing the facts.</i>

984
01:26:30,287 --> 01:26:35,645
<i>There it was. Betty Schaefer; s future</i>
<i>right in the palm of my hand.</i>

985
01:26:35,807 --> 01:26:40,801
<i>Betty Schaefer engaged to Artie</i>
<i>Green, as nice a guy as ever lived,</i>

986
01:26:40,967 --> 01:26:45,040
<i>and she was in love with me - me.</i>

987
01:26:56,567 --> 01:27:00,719
<i>She was a fool not to sense there</i>
<i>was something phoney in my set-up.</i>

988
01:27:00,887 --> 01:27:03,959
<i>I was a heel not to have told her.</i>

989
01:27:04,127 --> 01:27:08,917
<i>But you just can; t say those things</i>
<i>to somebody you; re crazy about.</i>

990
01:27:09,087 --> 01:27:14,002
<i>Maybe I could get away with it,</i>
<i>get away from Norma.</i>

991
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:18,797
<i>Maybe I could wipe</i>
<i>the whole nasty mess out of my life.</i>

992
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:29,517
Hello, is this Gladstone 9281?

993
01:27:29,687 --> 01:27:33,839
May I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer?
She must be home by now.

994
01:27:34,407 --> 01:27:39,561
Hey, Betty, here's that
weird-sounding woman again.

995
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:44,755
Well, what is this anyway?
This is Betty Schaefer.

996
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:49,205
Forgive me for calling so late,
but I feel it's my duty.

997
01:27:49,367 --> 01:27:53,997
It's about Mr Gillis.
You do know Mr Gillis?

998
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:58,001
Exactly how much
do you know about him?

999
01:27:58,167 --> 01:28:04,720
Do you know where he lives,
how he lives, what he lives on?

1000
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:09,206
Who are you? What do you want?
What business is it of yours?

1001
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:13,406
Miss Schaefer,
I'm trying to do you a favour

1002
01:28:13,567 --> 01:28:17,003
and spare you a great deal of misery.

1003
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:21,763
You may be too young to even
suspect there are men of his sort.

1004
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:25,715
I don't know what he's said,
but he does not live with relatives,

1005
01:28:25,887 --> 01:28:30,039
nor with friends
in the usual sense of the word.

1006
01:28:30,207 --> 01:28:33,324
Ask him. Ask him again.

1007
01:28:38,007 --> 01:28:41,158
That's right, Betty,
ask me again. This is Joe.

1008
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:45,805
Joe, where are you?
What is this all about?

1009
01:28:47,607 --> 01:28:51,077
Better yet,
come out and see for yourself.

1010
01:28:51,247 --> 01:28:56,480
The address is
10086 Sunset Boulevard.

1011
01:29:09,847 --> 01:29:13,556
Don't hate me, Joe.
I did it because I need you.

1012
01:29:13,727 --> 01:29:17,959
I need you as I've never needed
you before. Look at me.

1013
01:29:18,127 --> 01:29:22,439
Look at my hands,
my face, under my eyes.

1014
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,519
How can I work if I'm wasting away
under this torment?

1015
01:29:25,687 --> 01:29:30,477
You don't know what I've been
through these last weeks.

1016
01:29:35,967 --> 01:29:40,882
I bought a revolver. I stood in front
of that mirror, but I couldn't do it.

1017
01:29:41,047 --> 01:29:43,436
Don't just stand there hating me.

1018
01:29:43,607 --> 01:29:48,123
Shout at me, strike me,
but don't hate me.

1019
01:29:48,287 --> 01:29:51,120
Say you don't hate me, Joe.

1020
01:30:04,727 --> 01:30:08,800
Here's 10079, Connie.
It must be over there.

1021
01:30:17,967 --> 01:30:22,995
- Betty, let me come with you.
- No, I'll be all right.

1022
01:30:29,087 --> 01:30:33,763
I love you, Joe.
I love you, Joe.

1023
01:30:33,927 --> 01:30:36,122
I love you.

1024
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:43,155
What are you going to do, Joe?
What are you going to do?

1025
01:30:50,447 --> 01:30:54,156
It's all right, Max. I'll take it.
Hello, Betty.

1026
01:30:54,327 --> 01:30:57,046
I'm so scared.
Is there something awful?

1027
01:30:57,207 --> 01:30:59,596
Come on in.

1028
01:31:04,887 --> 01:31:07,959
Ever been in one of these
old Hollywood palazzos?

1029
01:31:08,127 --> 01:31:11,642
That's from when they were making
$18,000 a week tax-free.

1030
01:31:11,807 --> 01:31:16,085
Careful of these tiles, they're slippery.
Valentino used to dance here.

1031
01:31:16,247 --> 01:31:19,796
- Is this where you live?
- You bet.

1032
01:31:19,967 --> 01:31:23,004
- Whose house is it?
- Hers.

1033
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:26,239
- Whose?
- Look around, there's a lot of her.

1034
01:31:26,407 --> 01:31:31,800
If you don't remember the face, you've
heard the name. Norma Desmond?

1035
01:31:31,967 --> 01:31:34,322
- That was her on the phone?
- Drink?

1036
01:31:34,487 --> 01:31:37,285
There's always champagne,
plenty of caviar.

1037
01:31:37,447 --> 01:31:41,281
- Why did she call me?
- Jealous.

1038
01:31:41,447 --> 01:31:45,565
Ever see so much junk? She had
the ceiling brought from Portugal.

1039
01:31:45,727 --> 01:31:47,843
And look at this.

1040
01:31:50,007 --> 01:31:51,725
Her own movie theatre.

1041
01:31:51,887 --> 01:31:57,200
I didn't come to see a house.
What about Norma Desmond?

1042
01:31:57,367 --> 01:32:01,997
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is an enormous place.

1043
01:32:02,167 --> 01:32:06,683
Eight master bedrooms.
A sunken tub in every bathroom.

1044
01:32:06,847 --> 01:32:10,203
There's a bowling alley in the cellar.

1045
01:32:11,727 --> 01:32:16,005
It's lonely here,
so she got herself a companion.

1046
01:32:16,167 --> 01:32:18,158
Very simple set-up.

1047
01:32:18,327 --> 01:32:21,603
Older woman who's well-to-do.

1048
01:32:21,767 --> 01:32:25,396
A younger man
who's not doing too well.

1049
01:32:25,567 --> 01:32:28,400
- Can you figure it out?
- No.

1050
01:32:28,567 --> 01:32:34,119
- I'll give you a few more clues.
- No, I haven't heard any of this.

1051
01:32:34,287 --> 01:32:38,246
I never got those telephone calls
and I've never been in this house.

1052
01:32:38,407 --> 01:32:40,398
Get your things and let's go.

1053
01:32:42,487 --> 01:32:44,125
All my things?

1054
01:32:44,287 --> 01:32:48,041
My 18 suits, my custom-made
shoes, the six dozen shirts,

1055
01:32:48,207 --> 01:32:52,723
the cufflinks, the platinum key-chains
and the cigarette cases?

1056
01:32:52,887 --> 01:32:56,516
- Come on, Joe.
- Come on where?

1057
01:32:56,687 --> 01:32:59,440
To a one-room apartment
I can't pay for,

1058
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,679
to a story that may sell
and very possibly won't?

1059
01:33:02,847 --> 01:33:07,204
- If you love me, Joe.
- Look, sweetie, be practical.

1060
01:33:07,367 --> 01:33:11,406
I've got a good deal here.
A long-term contract with no options.

1061
01:33:11,567 --> 01:33:15,845
I like it that way.
Maybe it's not very admirable.

1062
01:33:18,487 --> 01:33:22,685
Well, you and Artie can be admirable.

1063
01:33:24,647 --> 01:33:28,720
I can't look at you any more, Joe.

1064
01:33:31,007 --> 01:33:36,161
How about looking for the exit?
This way, Betty.

1065
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:56,436
Good luck, Betty. You can finish
that script on the way to Arizona.

1066
01:33:56,607 --> 01:34:00,520
When you and Artie get back,
if you ever want a swim...

1067
01:34:02,087 --> 01:34:04,647
...here's the pool.

1068
01:34:46,527 --> 01:34:49,519
Thank you, darling. Thank you, Joe.

1069
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:53,163
Joe.

1070
01:35:16,767 --> 01:35:20,237
May I come in, Joe?
I've stopped crying.

1071
01:35:20,407 --> 01:35:24,002
I'm all right again.
Tell me you're not cross.

1072
01:35:24,167 --> 01:35:27,876
Tell me everything
is just as it was, Joe.

1073
01:35:30,047 --> 01:35:31,958
Joe.

1074
01:35:34,607 --> 01:35:37,201
What are you doing, Joe?

1075
01:35:42,287 --> 01:35:45,324
- What are you doing?
- I'm packing.

1076
01:35:48,007 --> 01:35:51,443
- You're leaving me?
- Yes, I am, Norma.

1077
01:35:51,607 --> 01:35:54,326
No, you're not. Max! Max!

1078
01:35:55,287 --> 01:36:01,203
Thanks for the handsome wardrobe
and for the use of all the trinkets.

1079
01:36:03,047 --> 01:36:05,880
- The rest's in the drawer.
- It's yours.

1080
01:36:06,047 --> 01:36:10,438
I'd take it, only it's too dressy
for a copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.

1081
01:36:11,007 --> 01:36:16,286
These are nothing. You can have
anything. What do you want?

1082
01:36:16,447 --> 01:36:18,165
Money?

1083
01:36:18,327 --> 01:36:22,320
You'd be throwing it away.
I don't qualify for the job any more.

1084
01:36:22,487 --> 01:36:27,242
You can't go. Max!
I can't face life without you.

1085
01:36:29,767 --> 01:36:33,840
- You know I'm not afraid to die.
- That's between you and yourself.

1086
01:36:34,007 --> 01:36:38,319
You think I made that up
about the gun, don't you? All right.

1087
01:36:46,327 --> 01:36:50,559
See? You didn't believe me.
You don't think I have the courage?

1088
01:36:50,727 --> 01:36:53,639
- Sure, if it makes a good scene.
- You don't care.

1089
01:36:53,807 --> 01:36:55,843
Hundreds of thousands will!

1090
01:36:56,007 --> 01:36:59,920
You'd be killing yourself to an empty
house. The audience left years ago.

1091
01:37:00,087 --> 01:37:03,602
- That's a lie. They still want me.
- No, they don't.

1092
01:37:03,767 --> 01:37:06,884
- What about DeMille?
- He was sparing your feelings.

1093
01:37:07,047 --> 01:37:10,039
- The studio only wanted your car.
- What?

1094
01:37:10,207 --> 01:37:13,677
DeMille didn't have
the heart to say. None of us has.

1095
01:37:13,847 --> 01:37:19,160
That's a lie. They want me.
I get letters every day.

1096
01:37:19,327 --> 01:37:24,082
You tell her, Max. Do her that favour.
Tell her there'll be no picture.

1097
01:37:24,247 --> 01:37:26,920
The only fan letters
are the ones you write.

1098
01:37:27,087 --> 01:37:30,318
That isn't true. Max!

1099
01:37:30,487 --> 01:37:34,036
Madame is the greatest star
of them all.

1100
01:37:34,207 --> 01:37:38,519
I will take Mr Gillis's bags to the car.

1101
01:37:43,167 --> 01:37:47,285
You heard him. I'm a star.

1102
01:37:47,447 --> 01:37:50,120
You're a woman of 50. Grow up.

1103
01:37:50,287 --> 01:37:54,599
There's nothing tragic about being 50,
unless you try to be 25.

1104
01:37:54,767 --> 01:37:58,123
The greatest star of them all.

1105
01:38:03,287 --> 01:38:05,596
Goodbye, Norma.

1106
01:38:06,967 --> 01:38:12,519
No one ever leaves a star.
That's what makes one a star.

1107
01:38:18,327 --> 01:38:21,558
Joe! Joe!

1108
01:38:22,927 --> 01:38:24,883
Joe!

1109
01:38:30,127 --> 01:38:32,357
Joe!

1110
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:08,078
The stars are ageless, aren't they?

1111
01:39:14,487 --> 01:39:17,957
<i>Well, this is where you came in.</i>

1112
01:39:18,127 --> 01:39:22,723
<i>Back at that pool again.</i>
<i>The one I always wanted.</i>

1113
01:39:22,887 --> 01:39:26,960
<i>It; s dawn now and they must; ve</i>
<i>photographed me a thousand times.</i>

1114
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:30,836
<i>Then they got a couple</i>
<i>of pruning hooks and fished me out</i>

1115
01:39:31,007 --> 01:39:33,237
<i>ever so gently.</i>

1116
01:39:33,407 --> 01:39:37,525
<i>Funny how gentle people</i>
<i>get with you once you; re dead.</i>

1117
01:39:38,247 --> 01:39:41,319
<i>They beached me</i>
<i>like a harpooned baby whale.</i>

1118
01:39:41,487 --> 01:39:47,164
<i>And started to check</i>
<i>the damage, just for the record.</i>

1119
01:39:47,727 --> 01:39:52,881
<i>The whole joint was jumping, cops,</i>
<i>reporters, neighbours, passers-by.</i>

1120
01:39:53,047 --> 01:39:56,722
<i>As much whoop-de-do as we get</i>
<i>when they open a supermarket.</i>

1121
01:39:56,887 --> 01:39:59,447
<i>Even the newsreel guys</i>
<i>came roaring in.</i>

1122
01:39:59,607 --> 01:40:03,725
<i>Here was an item</i>
<i>everybody could have some fun with.</i>

1123
01:40:03,887 --> 01:40:09,200
<i>The heartless so-and-sos.</i>
<i>What would they do to Norma?</i>

1124
01:40:09,367 --> 01:40:14,646
<i>Even if she got away with it in court,</i>
<i>crime of passion, temporary insanity,</i>

1125
01:40:14,807 --> 01:40:17,401
<i>those headlines would kill her.</i>

1126
01:40:17,567 --> 01:40:20,365
<i>; ; Forgotten star a slayer. ; ;

1127
01:40:20,527 --> 01:40:24,884
<i>; ; Ageing actress. ; ;
<i>; ; Yesterday; s glamour queen. ; ;

1128
01:40:34,887 --> 01:40:38,800
Coroner's office.
I want to speak to the coroner.

1129
01:40:40,127 --> 01:40:43,278
- Who's on this phone?
- I am. Get off!

1130
01:40:43,447 --> 01:40:45,039
This is more important.

1131
01:40:45,207 --> 01:40:47,198
"Times" city desk?
Hedda Hopper speaking.

1132
01:40:47,367 --> 01:40:49,517
I'm talking from
Norma Desmond's bedroom.

1133
01:40:49,687 --> 01:40:53,316
Don't bother with a rewrite.
Take it direct. Ready?

1134
01:40:53,487 --> 01:40:56,001
As day breaks over
the murder house, Norma Desmond,

1135
01:40:56,167 --> 01:41:00,922
famous star of yesteryear, is
in a state of complete mental shock.

1136
01:41:01,087 --> 01:41:03,123
A curtain of silence surrounds her

1137
01:41:03,287 --> 01:41:06,165
in the boudoir of her house
on Sunset Boulevard...

1138
01:41:06,327 --> 01:41:10,036
Was it a sudden quarrel?
Had you had any trouble before?

1139
01:41:11,127 --> 01:41:14,039
How come this gun was right there?

1140
01:41:14,207 --> 01:41:18,837
This guy, where did you meet him?
Where did he come from?

1141
01:41:19,007 --> 01:41:23,125
Had you thought of doing
something like this before?

1142
01:41:23,287 --> 01:41:27,838
Was theft involved? Did you catch
him trying to steal something?

1143
01:41:28,007 --> 01:41:30,840
- The newsreel cameras are here.
- Tell them to go.

1144
01:41:31,007 --> 01:41:33,601
This is no time for cameras.

1145
01:41:33,767 --> 01:41:38,557
Now, Miss Desmond,
is there anything you want to tell us?

1146
01:41:38,727 --> 01:41:43,801
Cameras? What is it, Max?

1147
01:41:48,567 --> 01:41:52,082
- The cameras have arrived.
- They have?

1148
01:41:52,247 --> 01:41:56,525
- Tell Mr DeMille I'll be right on set.
- What is this?

1149
01:42:01,207 --> 01:42:05,041
It's one way to get her downstairs.

1150
01:42:05,207 --> 01:42:10,042
Let's have the car right outside. OK.

1151
01:42:11,367 --> 01:42:15,519
- Everything will be ready, Madame.
- Thank you, Max.

1152
01:42:15,687 --> 01:42:21,045
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but I must get ready for my scene.

1153
01:42:21,207 --> 01:42:23,357
- What's happening?
- Any statement?

1154
01:42:23,527 --> 01:42:25,882
Is there a confession?

1155
01:42:26,047 --> 01:42:28,686
- Everything set up?
- Just about.

1156
01:42:28,847 --> 01:42:31,441
- Lights ready?
- All set.

1157
01:42:42,927 --> 01:42:45,725
OK, fellas, hold it, hold it!

1158
01:42:48,407 --> 01:42:50,796
Quiet, everybody!

1159
01:42:53,087 --> 01:42:54,679
Lights.

1160
01:42:58,807 --> 01:43:00,365
Ready, Norma?

1161
01:43:02,647 --> 01:43:06,959
What is the scene? Where am I?

1162
01:43:09,447 --> 01:43:11,438
This is the palace staircase.

1163
01:43:14,167 --> 01:43:17,239
Oh, yes, yes.

1164
01:43:17,407 --> 01:43:21,525
Down below
they're waiting for the princess.

1165
01:43:23,247 --> 01:43:24,680
I'm ready.

1166
01:43:25,487 --> 01:43:30,003
All right. Cameras. Action!

1167
01:43:32,567 --> 01:43:37,687
<i>So they were turning after all,</i>
<i>those cameras.</i>

1168
01:43:37,847 --> 01:43:44,116
<i>Life, which can be strangely merciful,</i>
<i>had taken pity on Norma Desmond.</i>

1169
01:43:44,287 --> 01:43:49,884
<i>The dream she had clung to</i>
<i>so desperately had enfolded her.</i>

1170
01:44:16,727 --> 01:44:20,925
I can't go on with this scene,
I'm too happy.

1171
01:44:21,087 --> 01:44:25,683
Mr DeMille, do you mind
if I say a few words? Thank you.

1172
01:44:25,847 --> 01:44:30,796
I want to say how happy I am to be
in the studio making a picture again.

1173
01:44:30,967 --> 01:44:36,678
You don't know how I've missed you.
I'll never desert you again.

1174
01:44:36,847 --> 01:44:41,204
Because after "Salome" we'll make
another picture and another.

1175
01:44:41,367 --> 01:44:46,885
You see, this is my life.
It always will be. There's nothing else.

1176
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:50,881
Just us and the cameras

1177
01:44:51,047 --> 01:44:55,598
and those wonderful people
out there in the dark.

1178
01:44:56,887 --> 01:44:59,242
All right, Mr DeMille,
I'm ready for my close-up.
