1
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:16,047
Cinderella

2
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:20,426
You're as lovely as your name

3
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:22,553
Cinderella

4
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:27,641
You're a sunset in a frame

5
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:31,145
Though you're dressed in rags

6
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:35,483
You wear an air of queenly grace

7
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:38,819
Anyone can see

8
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:43,782
A throne would be your proper place

9
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,077
Cinderella

10
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:51,123
If you'll give your heart a chance

11
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:53,167
It will lead you

12
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:58,589
To the kingdom of romance

13
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:05,929
There you'll see your dreams unfold

14
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,475
Cinderella

15
00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:12,895
Cinderella

16
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:22,196
In the sweetest story ever told

17
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:39,588
Once upon a time... in a faraway land,

18
00:01:40,088 --> 00:01:41,590
there was a tiny kingdom...

19
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:45,635
peaceful, prosperous,

20
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:47,971
and rich in romance and tradition.

21
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,060
Here, in a stately chateau,

22
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,188
there lived a widowed gentleman...

23
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:58,273
and his little daughter, Cinderella.

24
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:03,236
Although he was a kind and devoted father,

25
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:06,323
and gave his beloved child
every luxury and comfort,

26
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:09,034
still he felt she needed a mother's care.

27
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:11,494
And so he married again,

28
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:15,165
choosing for his second wife
a woman of good family...

29
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:18,084
with two daughters just Cinderella's age.

30
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,213
By name... Anastasia and Drizella.

31
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:27,594
It was upon the untimely death
of this good man, however,

32
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:30,388
that the stepmother's
true nature was revealed.

33
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,266
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous...

34
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:35,727
of Cinderella's charm and beauty,

35
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:38,354
she was grimly determined
to forward the interests...

36
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:40,481
of her own two awkward daughters.

37
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:45,361
Thus, as time went by,

38
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:47,739
the chateau fell into disrepair,

39
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:49,782
for the family fortunes were squandered...

40
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:52,368
upon the vain and selfish stepsisters,

41
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:55,663
while Cinderella was abused, humiliated,

42
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:59,250
and finally forced to become
a servant in her own house.

43
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,004
And yet, through it all,

44
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:06,340
Cinderella remained ever gentle and kind,

45
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:10,511
for with each dawn she found
new hope that someday...

46
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:13,139
her dreams of happiness would come true.

47
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:58,183
Well, serves you right...
spoiling people's best dreams.

48
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,145
Yes, I know it's a lovely morning, but...

49
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:04,315
it was a lovely dream too.

50
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:10,320
What kind of a dream?

51
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:12,948
Uh-uh. Can't tell.

52
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:18,203
'Cause if you tell a wish,
it won't come true.

53
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,372
And after all...

54
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:24,543
A dream is a wish

55
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:28,088
Your heart makes

56
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:34,344
When you're fast asleep

57
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:41,768
In dreams, you will lose
your heartaches

58
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:46,898
Whatever you wish for

59
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:50,026
You keep

60
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:54,906
Have faith in your dreams

61
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,578
And someday

62
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,960
Your rainbow will
come smiling through

63
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:12,966
No matter how your heart is grieving

64
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:18,596
If you keep on believing

65
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:23,184
The dream that you wish

66
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:29,858
Will come true

67
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:35,697
Oh, that clock! Old killjoy!

68
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:38,950
I hear you. "Come on, get up!" you say.

69
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,786
"Time to start another day."

70
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,998
Even he orders me around.

71
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,875
Well, there's one thing.

72
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:50,795
They can't order me to stop dreaming.

73
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:53,756
And perhaps someday...

74
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:58,219
The dreams that I wish

75
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:05,017
Will come true

76
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,577
Shoo! Shoo! Hurry!

77
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:24,412
Come on, Jaq. Shoo!

78
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:37,133
la.la...ha.ha...la.la...

79
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:14,670
No matter how your heart is grieving

80
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:20,008
If you keep on believing

81
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:24,513
The dream that you wish

82
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:29,393
Will come true

83
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:31,395
Look what I found!

84
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:34,565
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

85
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:36,608
One at a time, please!

86
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:39,194
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?

87
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,071
New mouse in the house.

88
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:42,447
Brand-new. Never saw before.

89
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:45,659
- Visitor, visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.

90
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:47,869
Well, she'll need a dress.

91
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,666
- No, no, no.
- She's a he. He, he!

92
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,293
Oh, that does make a difference.

93
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:57,921
- He'll need a jacket, shoes...
- Gotta get out! Gotta get out!

94
00:07:58,964 --> 00:07:59,714
- In a trap-trap!
- Trap-trap!

95
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,967
Where? In a trap?

96
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:04,094
Well, why didn't you say so?

97
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:20,527
Now, now, now... Calm down, everybody.

98
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:22,737
Oh...

99
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,990
The poor little thing’s scared to death.

100
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,284
Jaq, maybe you'd better
explain things to him.

101
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:29,703
Zuk-zuk, Cinderelly. Zuk-zuk.

102
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:31,663
Now, now, now...

103
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:33,123
Look-a, little guy.

104
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:35,834
Take it r-easy. Nothin' to worry 'bout.

105
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,335
We like-a you.

106
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,003
Cinderelly like you too. She's nice.

107
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:41,756
Very nice. That's-a better.

108
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,008
Come on, now. Zuk-zuk-zuk!

109
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:46,302
Za... za... zuk-zuk.

110
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:50,431
Well, that's better.

111
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,812
Well, let's just slip it on for size.

112
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:00,525
It is a little snug,

113
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:02,402
but it'll have to do.

114
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:04,821
Now, for a name.

115
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:08,908
I've got one... Octavious!

116
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:11,327
But for short, we'll call you Gus.

117
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,913
Like it, Gus-Gus? Like it? Like it?

118
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:15,123
Uh... Gus-Gus.

119
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:16,999
Now I've got to hurry.

120
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,751
See that he keeps out of trouble, Jaq,

121
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:21,462
and don't forget to warn him about the cat.

122
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:24,715
Zuk-zuk. Look-a... uh, uh...
ever seen a cat-cat?

123
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,384
Duh... cat-cat?

124
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,135
Hup! Cat-cat! R-ucifee, that's-a him.

125
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:31,722
Mean...sneaky... Jump at you!

126
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,850
Jump at you! Ha! Big, Big! Big as a house!

127
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,646
Zuk-zuk... R-ucifee?

128
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:41,357
Duh... R-ucifee. Zuk-zuk.

129
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:15,265
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

130
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:19,436
Come, kitty. Come on.

131
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:27,569
Lucifer! Come here!

132
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:47,839
I'm sorry if Your Highness
objects to an early breakfast.

133
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:51,343
It's certainly not my idea to feed you first.

134
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:55,013
It's orders. Come on.

135
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,683
Duh... R-ucifee. Is that a R-ucifee?

136
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:00,644
Zuk... R-ucifee. That's-a him!

137
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,272
Gus-Gus take-a R-ucifee and...

138
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:07,317
Look-it.

139
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,527
Wait! No, Gus-Gus, no!

140
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,862
Now, listen here. R-ucifee not-a funny.

141
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:12,447
R-ucifee mean.

142
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:27,963
Bruno...

143
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:31,466
Bruno!

144
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:40,141
Dreaming again.

145
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,310
Chasing Lucifer?

146
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,229
Catch him this time?

147
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:46,189
That's bad!

148
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,860
Suppose they heard you upstairs?

149
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,529
You know the orders.

150
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,241
So if you don’t want to lose a nice warm bed,

151
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:58,243
you'd better get rid of those dreams.

152
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:00,828
You know how?

153
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,248
Just learn to like cats.

154
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:08,503
No, I mean it.

155
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:10,338
Lucifer has his good points too.

156
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,715
For one thing, he...

157
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:17,804
Well...Sometimes he...

158
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,098
Hmm...

159
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:23,601
There must be something good about him.

160
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:37,865
Bruno!

161
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:40,493
Oh, Bruno.

162
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,746
Come on now, outside.

163
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,542
I know it isn't easy,

164
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:51,587
but at least we should
try to get along together.

165
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,384
And that includes you, Your Majesty!

166
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,770
Breakfast time! Everybody up!

167
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:09,104
Hurry, hurry!

168
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:11,065
Come on, everybody. Breakfast, breakfast!

169
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:14,526
- Come on, everybody, breakfee!- Breakfast!

170
00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:16,528
Breakfast?

171
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:17,821
Ooh, breakfast!

172
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:19,073
Oh-oh!

173
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,044
R-ucifee! How we gonna get out?

174
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,340
Hup-hup... carefee!

175
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:40,469
Listen, everybody! Got an idea.

176
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:43,472
Now, somebody gotta sneak out.

177
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,515
Let R-ucifee chase him.

178
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,810
Run over to a corner and beat R-ucifee there.

179
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:50,479
Then we all run out. Zuk?

180
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:51,772
Zuk-zuk, out!

181
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,024
Now we choose the one that do it.

182
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:55,859
Everybody, hup!

183
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:57,694
- Hup!
- Uh, hup.

184
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,237
- R-ails up!
- Hup!

185
00:14:01,782 --> 00:14:02,699
Now...

186
00:14:02,824 --> 00:14:03,825
Hup, hup, hup!

187
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:06,578
Uh, duh... uh, hup!

188
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:55,227
Oh, there you are.

189
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:56,771
I was wondering.

190
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:00,232
All right, breakfast is served.

191
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:14,455
Uh... take it r-easy. Zuk-zuk.

192
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:18,959
Uh, duh... let go! Let go now!

193
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:21,420
Let... go...

194
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:26,383
Stop that. Shoo, shoo, shoo.
Go on! Shoo, shoo, shoo!

195
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:29,762
Poor little Gus.

196
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,764
Here.

197
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:33,223
Help yourself.

198
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:14,782
Hmm... No Gus-gus.

199
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:18,870
Well, guess he got away.

200
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:39,390
Cinderella!

201
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:45,605
I'm coming. Oh, my goodness.

202
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:46,856
Morning, noon, and night.

203
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:49,609
- Cinderella!
- Coming!

204
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,819
Coming!

205
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:01,245
Cinderella!

206
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:03,914
I'm coming.

207
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:16,927
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.

208
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:19,597
Cinderella!

209
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,320
Cinderella!

210
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:14,443
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?

211
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:16,278
As if you cared.

212
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:18,989
Take that ironing and
have it back in an hour.

213
00:20:19,614 --> 00:20:20,574
One hour!

214
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:22,534
- You hear?
- Yes, Drizella.

215
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,169
Good morning, Anastasia.

216
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:36,089
Well, it's about time!
Don't forget the mending.

217
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:39,301
And don't be all day getting it done, either!

218
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:40,719
Yes, Anastasia.

219
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:44,806
- A-a-ahem.
- Well, come in, child.

220
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:47,934
- Come in.
- Good morning, Stepmother.

221
00:20:48,393 --> 00:20:50,478
Pick up the laundry
and get on with your duties.

222
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:51,730
Yes, Stepmother.

223
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:11,124
Mother! Oh, Mother, Mother!

224
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:12,584
Mother! You did it!

225
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,461
You did it on purpose! Mother!

226
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,505
Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother!

227
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:18,756
- Now what did you do?
- Oh!

228
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:21,467
She put it there!

229
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:22,719
A big ugly mouse...

230
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:24,095
under my teacup!

231
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:26,973
All right, Lucifer.

232
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:28,891
What did you do with him?

233
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:31,853
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.

234
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,479
We'll just see about this.

235
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:36,107
Come on! Let him go.

236
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:41,529
Now the other one. Come on! Oh...

237
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:43,197
poor little Gus.

238
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:51,289
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?

239
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:52,373
Cinderella!

240
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,874
Yes, Stepmother.

241
00:21:59,422 --> 00:22:02,425
- Are you gonna get it!
- Close the door, Cinderella.

242
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:11,267
Come here.

243
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:27,283
Oh, please, you don't think--

244
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,701
Hold your tongue!

245
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:30,911
Now...

246
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:36,000
It seems we have time on our hands.

247
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,918
- But I was only trying to--
- Silence!

248
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:43,924
Time for vicious practical jokes.

249
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:47,428
Perhaps we can put it to better use.

250
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:49,805
Now... let me see.

251
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:53,851
There’s the large carpet in the main hall.

252
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:55,769
Clean it!

253
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:58,772
And the windows, upstairs and down.

254
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:00,524
Wash them!

255
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:02,693
Oh, yes...

256
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:05,320
and the tapestries, and the draperies.

257
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:07,281
- But I just fin--
- Do them again!

258
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:09,700
And don't forget...

259
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,160
the garden... then scrub
the terrace... sweep the halls...

260
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:13,829
and the stairs... clean the chimneys.

261
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:15,330
And of course, there's the mending,

262
00:23:15,747 --> 00:23:16,999
and the sewing, and the laundry.

263
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:24,339
Oh, yes, and one more thing.

264
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:28,135
See that Lucifer gets his bath.

265
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,696
- But, but, but--
- No "buts" about it!

266
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:51,116
My son has been avoiding
his responsibilities long enough!

267
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,661
It's high time he married and settled down.

268
00:23:55,578 --> 00:23:56,663
Of course, Your Majesty.

269
00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:00,792
- But we must be patient.
- I am patient!

270
00:24:03,378 --> 00:24:06,840
But I’m not getting any younger, you know.

271
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:10,552
I want to see my grandchildren before I go.

272
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:12,262
I understand, Sire.

273
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,890
No, no, you don't know
what it means to see...

274
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:18,643
your only child grow farther...

275
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,522
farther... and farther away from you.

276
00:24:23,815 --> 00:24:27,735
I'm lonely in this desolate old palace.

277
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:29,362
I...

278
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,408
I want to hear the pitter-patter
of little feet again.

279
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:36,577
Now, now, Your Majesty.

280
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,539
Perhaps if we just let him alone.

281
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:42,500
Let him alone?

282
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,753
W-w-with his silly romantic ideas?

283
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:48,881
But, but, Sire, in matters of love--

284
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:50,550
Love... Ha!

285
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:54,679
Just a boy meeting a girl
under the right conditions.

286
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,848
So, we're arranging the conditions.

287
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:01,269
But, but, Your Majesty,
if the Prince should suspect--

288
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:01,936
Suspect?

289
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:03,646
Ha! Look...

290
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,190
the boy's coming home today, isn't he?

291
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,274
Yes, Sire.

292
00:25:07,566 --> 00:25:09,568
Well, what could be
more natural than a ball...

293
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:12,446
- to celebrate his return?
- N-n-nothing, Sire.

294
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:16,325
If all the eligible maidens
in my kingdom just...

295
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:20,037
happened to be there,

296
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:24,166
why he's bound to show
interest in one of them, isn't he?

297
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:26,460
Isn't he?

298
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:28,254
Y-y-yes, Sire.

299
00:25:28,587 --> 00:25:30,214
The moment he does...

300
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:35,094
soft lights, romantic music,

301
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:37,972
all the trimmings.

302
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:40,766
It can't possibly fail.

303
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:43,143
Can it?

304
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:46,438
Y-y-yes, Sire. N-n-no, Sire.

305
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:49,983
Very well, Sire. I shall
arrange the ball for--

306
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:51,402
Tonight!

307
00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:54,822
- Tonight? Oh, but, Sire--
- Tonight!

308
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:58,158
And see that every eligible maid is there!

309
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:01,286
Understand?

310
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:04,665
Yes, Your Majesty.

311
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,253
The pear-shaped tones.

312
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:14,508
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

313
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:17,761
Sing sweet nightingale

314
00:26:18,512 --> 00:26:21,848
High...

315
00:26:22,557 --> 00:26:23,934
Above me

316
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:28,397
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

317
00:26:28,897 --> 00:26:31,858
Sing sweet nightingale

318
00:26:32,484 --> 00:26:36,404
High...

319
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,241
Above...

320
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:43,370
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

321
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:46,498
Sing sweet nightingale

322
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:53,797
High...

323
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,009
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

324
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:06,059
Sing sweet nightingale

325
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,022
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

326
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:15,318
Sing...sweet...

327
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:19,572
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

328
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,618
Sing...

329
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:28,039
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

330
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,087
Oh, sing sweet...

331
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,589
Oh...

332
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:40,218
Sing...

333
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:43,346
Oh! Oh, Lucifer!

334
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:48,518
You mean old thing!

335
00:27:51,187 --> 00:27:52,230
I'm just going to have to...

336
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:53,397
teach you a lesson.

337
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,567
Open in the name of the King!

338
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:01,197
An urgent message from His Imperial Majesty.

339
00:28:02,073 --> 00:28:03,866
- Thank you.
- From the King!

340
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,368
What's it say, Cinderelly?

341
00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:07,578
Duh... uh... uh... What's it say, huh?

342
00:28:08,162 --> 00:28:09,038
I don’t know.

343
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:11,624
He said it’s urgent.

344
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:15,670
Maybe I should interrupt the... uh...

345
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:16,962
music lesson.

346
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:18,672
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

347
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:21,759
Sing sweet nightingale

348
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:27,681
High...

349
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,644
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.

350
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:32,895
- Be still, you!
- You're always--

351
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:34,563
- Girls, girls!- It's her fault, Mother.

352
00:28:34,772 --> 00:28:35,606
Above all...

353
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,483
self-control.

354
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,569
Yes!

355
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,365
Cinderella!

356
00:28:44,448 --> 00:28:45,532
I've warned you
never to interrupt while--

357
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:47,284
But this just arrived from the palace.

358
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,577
From the palace!

359
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:50,162
- Give it here!- Let me have it!

360
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:51,413
- No, it's mine!
- No--

361
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:52,373
I'll read it.

362
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,375
Well...

363
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,210
- There's to be a ball.- A ball!

364
00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:58,504
In honour of His Highness, the Prince!

365
00:28:58,879 --> 00:28:59,671
Oh, the Prince!

366
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:01,423
And by royal command,

367
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:04,885
every eligible maiden is to attend.

368
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:07,387
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible!

369
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,558
Why, that means I can go too!

370
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,937
Ha! Her, dancing with the Prince!

371
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:17,814
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.

372
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,233
Would you mind holding my broom?

373
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,864
Well, why not?

374
00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:29,826
After all, I'm still a member of the family.

375
00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:32,788
And it says, "By royal command...

376
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,707
every eligible maiden is to attend."

377
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,543
Yes... So it does.

378
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:42,672
Well, I see no reason why you can't go...

379
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,967
if you get all your work done.

380
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:48,178
Oh, I will! I promise.

381
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:50,222
And if you can find something...

382
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,431
suitable to wear.

383
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:52,974
I'm sure I can!

384
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:54,851
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.

385
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:58,563
Mother! Do you realize what you just said?

386
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:00,440
Of course.

387
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:03,068
I said, "If..."

388
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,945
Oh, "If..."

389
00:30:15,705 --> 00:30:17,707
Isn't it lovely? It was my mother's.

390
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:19,375
It's pretty-pretty, but it’s old.

391
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,378
Well, maybe it is a little
old-fashioned, but...

392
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,630
oh, I'll fix that.

393
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:25,924
H-H-How you do that, huh?

394
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:27,508
Wait a minute.

395
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:28,635
There ought to be...

396
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:29,677
some good ideas in here.

397
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:32,013
Uh-huh.

398
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,681
This one.

399
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,391
- Oh, very nice-nice.
- Like it!

400
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:36,517
- We can do it.- It'll be R-easy.

401
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,936
I'll have to shorten
the sleeves... I'll need a sash...

402
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:41,022
a ruffle... and something for a collar.

403
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:42,774
- And then I'll--
- Cinderella!

404
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:44,692
Oh, now what do they want?

405
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:46,444
- Cinderella!
- Cinderella!

406
00:30:47,737 --> 00:30:50,740
Oh, well, guess my dress
will just have to wait.

407
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,701
- Cinderella!
- Cinderella!

408
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,496
All right, all right! I'm coming.

409
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,751
Poor Cinderelly.

410
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:03,961
Every time she find a minute,

411
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:05,504
that's the time when they begin it!

412
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:09,467
- Cinderelly, Cinderelly--
- Cinderella!

413
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,054
Cinderelly, Cinderelly

414
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,764
Night and day it's Cinderelly

415
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,432
Make the fire, fix the breakfast

416
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:18,309
Wash the dishes, do the mopping

417
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:20,186
And the sweeping and the dusting

418
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:22,271
They always keep her hoppin'

419
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:24,065
She go around in circles

420
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:25,858
'Til she's very, very dizzy

421
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:26,942
Still they holler

422
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,195
Keep-a busy, Cinderelly

423
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:32,490
Yeah...Keep-a busy.

424
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:36,744
You know what?

425
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:39,246
Cinderelly's not go to the ball.

426
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:40,414
What?

427
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:41,874
- Not go?
- What did you say?

428
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:46,045
You'll see. They fix her.

429
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:49,256
Work, work, work.

430
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:51,550
She'll never get her dress done.

431
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:54,553
P-p-poor Cinderelly.

432
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:58,349
Hey! We can do it!

433
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:00,267
We can do it we can do it

434
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,061
We can help our Cinderelly

435
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,021
We can make the dress so pretty

436
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:05,939
There’s nothing to it, really

437
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,316
We'll tie a sash around it

438
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:09,610
Put a ribbon through it

439
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:11,236
When dancing at the ball

440
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:12,988
She'll be more beautiful than all

441
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:16,408
In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly

442
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:18,619
Hurry, hurry hurry, hurry

443
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,495
Gonna help our Cinderelly

444
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:22,164
Got no time to dillydally

445
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,166
We got to get a-goin'

446
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:25,918
I'll cut it with the scissors

447
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:27,836
And I can do the sewing

448
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:29,588
Leave the sewing to the women

449
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:31,673
You go get some trimmin'

450
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:34,593
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly

451
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:38,013
We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly

452
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:40,307
Follow me, Gus-Gus. I know where to go.

453
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:42,809
Find a pretty-pretty if we can.

454
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:45,687
Ho-ho-ho. Cinderelly needs help.

455
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:48,356
Surprise, surprise! Pretty
surprise for Cinderelly!

456
00:32:57,282 --> 00:32:59,784
- And this too, Cinderella,
my slippers. Now don't forget-

457
00:32:59,993 --> 00:33:02,037
- Cinderella, take my dress!
- Here, mend the buttonholes.

458
00:33:02,495 --> 00:33:04,372
Press my skirt too, and mind
the ruffle. You're always--

459
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:06,249
- And, Cinderella...
- Yes?

460
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:09,836
When you're through, and before
you begin your regular chores,

461
00:33:10,545 --> 00:33:11,921
I have a few little things.

462
00:33:12,297 --> 00:33:14,841
- Very well.
- Mother I don't see why...

463
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:17,010
everybody else seems to have
such nice things to wear...

464
00:33:17,052 --> 00:33:18,803
and I always end up in these old rags.

465
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:20,180
This sash!

466
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,140
Why, I wouldn’t be seen dead in it!

467
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,060
You should talk! These beads!
I'm sick of looking at them!

468
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:30,023
- Trash! Oh, I hate--
- I don't see why I can't have-

469
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:33,193
Come on! Now, be carefee.

470
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:37,488
Duh... uh... yes-yes-yes, real carefee.

471
00:33:47,165 --> 00:33:49,208
Oh-ho-ho! We can use that, Gus-Gus!

472
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:51,127
Uh... pretty-pretty
pretty-pretty--

473
00:33:51,252 --> 00:33:52,545
Shhh! Look-it!

474
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:53,963
R-ucifee!

475
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:39,758
Uh... duh... duh... look.

476
00:34:39,884 --> 00:34:42,720
Oh, beads! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

477
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:43,971
Very pretty beads! Oh-ho-ho!

478
00:34:44,263 --> 00:34:45,014
Shhh!

479
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:52,140
A dream is a wish your heart makes

480
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:55,810
When you're fast asleep

481
00:36:56,853 --> 00:36:59,856
In dreams you will lose your heartaches

482
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:03,443
Whatever you wish for you keep

483
00:37:06,821 --> 00:37:09,949
Have faith in your dreams and someday

484
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:16,289
No matter how your heart is grieving

485
00:37:16,747 --> 00:37:18,332
If you keep on believing

486
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,460
The dream that you wish will come true

487
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:39,145
Okay. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8.

488
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:43,607
Whatever you wish for you keep.

489
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,319
All right.

490
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:50,990
Heave-ho, heave-ho!

491
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,867
Heave-ho.

492
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:56,662
Mmmm mm mm believing

493
00:37:56,954 --> 00:37:58,831
The dream that you wish will come...

494
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:02,793
Will come true...

495
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:03,395
Yes?

496
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:05,480
- The carriage is here.
- Oh.

497
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:09,526
Why, Cinderella, you're not ready, child.

498
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,152
I'm not going.

499
00:39:11,611 --> 00:39:14,531
Not going? Oh, what a shame.

500
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:16,908
But of course, there will be...

501
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,619
- other times, and--
- Yes. Good night.

502
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:34,259
Oh, well. What's a royal ball?

503
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,221
After all, I suppose it would be...

504
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:40,473
frightfully dull... and... and boring...

505
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,475
and... and completely...

506
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:45,770
completely wonderful.

507
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:54,779
Oh, why... it’s my...

508
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:56,489
Surprise!

509
00:39:56,572 --> 00:39:57,615
Surprise! Surprise!

510
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:00,493
- Surprise!
- Duh... duh... Happy birthday!

511
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:03,204
- No, no, no, no!
- Why, I never dreamed...

512
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:05,623
It's such a surprise!

513
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:07,667
Oh!

514
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:10,211
How can I ever...why...

515
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:13,339
Oh, thank you so much!

516
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:23,099
Now remember, when you're
presented to His Highness,

517
00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:24,809
- be sure--
- Wait!

518
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:27,019
Please... wait for me!

519
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:29,605
Isn't it lovely?

520
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:32,024
Do you like it?

521
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:33,776
Do you think it will do?

522
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:37,571
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't!

523
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,031
- You wouldn't--
- Oh, no! You...

524
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:40,533
- can't let her!
- Girls, please!

525
00:40:42,952 --> 00:40:44,620
After all, we did make a bargain.

526
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:46,622
Didn't we, Cinderella?

527
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,961
And I never go back on my word.

528
00:40:54,296 --> 00:40:55,256
How very clever,

529
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,508
these beads.

530
00:40:58,551 --> 00:41:00,594
They give it just the right touch.

531
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:03,722
Don't you think so, Drizella?

532
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:05,349
No, I don't! I think she's--

533
00:41:06,642 --> 00:41:08,811
Why you little thief!

534
00:41:09,895 --> 00:41:11,855
They’re my beads! Give them here!

535
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:13,023
Oh, no!

536
00:41:13,357 --> 00:41:16,568
Oh... and look, that's my sash!
Wearing my sash! She can't!

537
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:18,862
Oh, don't! Please, stop!

538
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:21,782
- My ribbon!
- Why, you thief!

539
00:41:22,324 --> 00:41:24,493
- Kitchen wench!
- You ungrateful little--

540
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:26,120
Girls, girls.

541
00:41:27,538 --> 00:41:28,372
That's quite enough.

542
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:30,499
Hurry along now, both of you.

543
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,960
I won’t have you upsetting yourselves.

544
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:39,258
Good night.

545
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:23,134
In dreams you will lose your heartaches

546
00:42:24,761 --> 00:42:28,056
Whatever you wish for you keep

547
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:31,059
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.

548
00:42:31,726 --> 00:42:35,772
Have faith in your dreams and someday

549
00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:37,857
It's just no use.

550
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:40,527
Your rainbow will come smiling through

551
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:42,320
No use at all.

552
00:42:43,738 --> 00:42:47,116
No matter how your heart is grieving

553
00:42:47,742 --> 00:42:50,828
If you keep on believing

554
00:42:51,454 --> 00:42:55,416
- I can't believe, not anymore.
- The dreams that you wish...

555
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:00,004
There’s nothing left to believe in.

556
00:43:01,005 --> 00:43:01,839
Nothing.

557
00:43:02,715 --> 00:43:03,800
Nothing, my dear?

558
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:06,928
Oh, now you don't really mean that.

559
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,347
- Oh, but I do!- Nonsense, child!

560
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:12,850
If you'd lost all your faith,
I couldn’t be here,

561
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:14,560
and here I am!

562
00:43:15,311 --> 00:43:17,563
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.

563
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:20,817
You can't go to the ball looking like that.

564
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:23,778
The ball? Oh, but I'm not--
- Of course you are.

565
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:25,696
But we'll have to hurry,

566
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:28,157
because even miracles take a little time.

567
00:43:28,574 --> 00:43:30,826
- Miracles?
- Uh-hmm. Watch.

568
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:34,288
What in the world did I do
with that magic wand?

569
00:43:34,872 --> 00:43:36,499
- I was sure I--
- Magic wand?

570
00:43:36,624 --> 00:43:39,251
That's strange... I... I always--

571
00:43:39,293 --> 00:43:41,003
Why then, you must be--

572
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:43,798
Your Fairy Godmother? Of course.

573
00:43:44,423 --> 00:43:46,175
Where is that wand? I--

574
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:48,928
Oh! I forgot.

575
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:51,013
I put it away.

576
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:56,143
- Look-a what she did!
- Duh... duh... How'd she do it

577
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:58,521
Now... let's see. Hmm...

578
00:43:59,814 --> 00:44:03,734
I'd say the first thing
you need is, um... a pumpkin.

579
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:06,445
- But... a pumpkin?
- Uh-huh. Now, um...

580
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:08,322
Now... the magic words.

581
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,199
Uh... Oh...

582
00:44:11,325 --> 00:44:12,409
Ahem!

583
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,038
Salaga doola menchicka boola

584
00:44:16,455 --> 00:44:18,040
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

585
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:20,542
Put them together and what have you got

586
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:22,503
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

587
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:25,005
Salaga doola menchicka boola

588
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:27,174
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

589
00:44:27,841 --> 00:44:29,510
It'll do magic believe it or not

590
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,762
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

591
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:33,222
Now salaga doola means

592
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:36,433
Menchicka boola roo

593
00:44:36,767 --> 00:44:38,977
But the thing-a-ma-bob that does the job

594
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:41,188
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

595
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:43,607
Oh, salaga doola menchicka boola

596
00:44:44,191 --> 00:44:45,734
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

597
00:44:46,485 --> 00:44:48,237
Put them together and what have you got

598
00:44:48,695 --> 00:44:49,529
Bibbidi-bobbidi

599
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,157
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

600
00:44:54,368 --> 00:44:55,786
- Oh, looky, looky.
- Isn't it wonderfee?

601
00:44:55,952 --> 00:44:56,995
Isn't it, huh?

602
00:44:57,496 --> 00:44:59,748
Oh, it's beautiful!

603
00:45:00,374 --> 00:45:02,376
Yes, isn't it?

604
00:45:03,126 --> 00:45:05,462
Now, with an elegant
coach like that, of course,

605
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:09,132
we'll simply have to have... uh...mice!

606
00:45:09,382 --> 00:45:10,967
Uh... uh... mice?

607
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,094
Oh, this really is nice.

608
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:16,306
Why, we'll have a coach-and-fou
when we're through.

609
00:45:17,057 --> 00:45:19,518
Just a wave of my stick,
and to finish the trick,

610
00:45:20,477 --> 00:45:21,603
Bibbidi.. bobbidi...

611
00:45:21,978 --> 00:45:23,230
boo!

612
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:24,481
Gracious, what did I do?

613
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:27,108
I was sure there were four there.

614
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,860
There should be one more.

615
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:31,363
Oh, ha-ha. There you are.

616
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,324
Bibbidi... bobbidi...

617
00:45:34,574 --> 00:45:35,325
boo!

618
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:46,544
- Shoo!- Oh, poor Lucifer.

619
00:45:47,796 --> 00:45:48,880
Serves him right, I'd say.

620
00:45:49,255 --> 00:45:50,548
Now... um... where were we?

621
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:51,925
Oh, goodness, yes.

622
00:45:53,176 --> 00:45:55,011
You can't go to the ball without... um...

623
00:45:55,678 --> 00:45:56,471
a horse!

624
00:45:57,305 --> 00:45:58,681
A-a-another one?

625
00:45:59,474 --> 00:46:02,352
But tonight, for a change,
you'll handle the reins...

626
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:04,938
and sit in the driver's seat too.

627
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:08,775
For instead of a horse,
why the coachman, of course.

628
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,486
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

629
00:46:14,864 --> 00:46:16,532
Well, that does it, I guess.

630
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:20,078
Except for-- oh, yes,
the finishing touch...

631
00:46:20,453 --> 00:46:23,831
and that's you. Yes, Bruno, that's right!

632
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:25,541
You'll be footman tonight.

633
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,419
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

634
00:46:30,463 --> 00:46:32,507
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.

635
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:33,883
- But... uh--
- Now, now, now...

636
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,384
don't try to thank me.

637
00:46:35,843 --> 00:46:38,763
Oh, I wasn't-- I mean... I do, but...

638
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,683
- but don't you think my dress-
- Yes, it's lovely, dear.

639
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:47,438
Lov-- Good heavens, child!
You can't go in that.

640
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,150
Now, uh.. let’s see, dear.

641
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:55,154
Your size... and the shade
of your eyes... Uh-hmm.

642
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,783
Something simple, but daring too.

643
00:46:59,575 --> 00:47:01,410
Oh, just leave it to me!

644
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:02,828
What a gown this will be.

645
00:47:03,662 --> 00:47:06,040
Bibbidi-bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi...

646
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,252
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

647
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:12,838
Oh, it's a beautiful dress!

648
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:16,133
Did you ever see such a beautiful dress?

649
00:47:17,426 --> 00:47:19,428
And look, glass slippers.

650
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:23,140
Why, it's like a dream,

651
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,185
a wonderful dream come true.

652
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:29,563
Yes, my child, but like all dreams,

653
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:32,566
well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.

654
00:47:33,442 --> 00:47:35,360
You'll have only
'til midnight and then--

655
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,280
- Midnight? Oh, thank you.
- Oh, now, now just a minute.

656
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,073
You must understand, my dear.

657
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,327
On the stroke of twelve,
the spell will be broken,

658
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,829
and everything will be as it was before.

659
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:47,497
Oh, I understand, but...

660
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,959
it's more than I ever hoped for.

661
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:52,711
Bless you, my child.

662
00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:56,632
I-- Goodness me! It's getting late!

663
00:47:57,132 --> 00:47:59,009
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.

664
00:47:59,468 --> 00:48:01,845
Have a good time, dance, be gay!

665
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,680
Now, off you go. You're on your way.

666
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:05,724
With a bibbidi-bobbidi, bibbidi-bobbidi...

667
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,642
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

668
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:39,007
The Princess Fredrica
Eugenie de la Fontaine.

669
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,264
M'amselle Augustina Dubois,

670
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:50,101
the daughter of General Pierre Dubois.

671
00:49:00,778 --> 00:49:02,906
Ah... the boy isn't cooperating.

672
00:49:04,532 --> 00:49:07,911
M'amselle Leanora Mercedes de la Torre,

673
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:12,624
daughter of Colonel and Madam de la Torre.

674
00:49:19,672 --> 00:49:21,758
I can't understand it!

675
00:49:22,341 --> 00:49:24,927
There must be at least one
who'd make a suitable mother.

676
00:49:25,553 --> 00:49:26,721
Shhh! Sire!

677
00:49:27,513 --> 00:49:29,140
Uh... a suitable wife.

678
00:49:48,826 --> 00:49:53,539
The Mademoiselles Drizella
and Anastasia Tremain,

679
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:57,209
daughters of Lady Tremain.

680
00:50:02,506 --> 00:50:04,175
I give up!

681
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,969
Even I couldn’t expect the boy to--

682
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:08,804
Well, if I may say so, Your Majesty.

683
00:50:09,054 --> 00:50:14,351
I did try to warn you, but you,
Sire, are incurably romantic.

684
00:50:15,102 --> 00:50:19,356
No doubt you saw the whole
pretty picture in detail.

685
00:50:20,399 --> 00:50:21,400
The young Prince...

686
00:50:22,276 --> 00:50:23,736
bowing to the assembly.

687
00:50:24,778 --> 00:50:25,779
Suddenly, he stops.

688
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,198
He looks up, for lo,

689
00:50:29,825 --> 00:50:33,203
there she stands, the girl of his dreams.

690
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:37,624
Who she is, or whence she came...

691
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,877
he knows not, nor does he care.

692
00:50:40,794 --> 00:50:42,463
But his heart tells him that here...

693
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:47,843
here is the maid predestined to be his bride.

694
00:50:50,012 --> 00:50:52,514
A pretty plot for fairytales, Sire,

695
00:50:53,265 --> 00:50:55,976
but in real Life... oh, no... no.

696
00:50:56,977 --> 00:50:58,437
It was foredoomed to failure.

697
00:50:58,937 --> 00:50:59,938
Failure, eh?

698
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:04,401
Take a look at that, you pompous windbag!

699
00:51:06,653 --> 00:51:08,030
Who is she? You know her?

700
00:51:08,488 --> 00:51:09,865
No, Sire.

701
00:51:10,032 --> 00:51:11,450
I've never seen her before.

702
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:13,660
That's one thing in her favour.

703
00:51:14,202 --> 00:51:15,871
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!

704
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:20,667
Soft lights.

705
00:51:21,543 --> 00:51:22,419
The lights!

706
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,232
Aha! Failure, eh!

707
00:51:48,445 --> 00:51:51,948
Well...now for a good night's sleep.

708
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:54,617
Quite so, Sire. I believe I too--

709
00:51:54,868 --> 00:51:56,453
You will stay right here.

710
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,663
See they're not disturbed.

711
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:00,707
And when the boy proposes...

712
00:52:01,124 --> 00:52:03,376
notify me immediately!

713
00:52:04,752 --> 00:52:06,462
- Notify me immed--
- And remember...

714
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:09,591
if anything goes wrong...

715
00:52:11,718 --> 00:52:21,811
la...ha...

716
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:28,735
- But who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?

717
00:52:29,235 --> 00:52:30,695
certainly seems to.

718
00:52:31,946 --> 00:52:33,322
But I know I've never seen her.

719
00:52:33,781 --> 00:52:35,283
Nor I.

720
00:52:35,408 --> 00:52:36,909
But she certainly is-- Wait...

721
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:41,122
there is something familiar about her.

722
00:52:49,171 --> 00:52:50,131
Ahem.

723
00:53:03,144 --> 00:53:04,270
So this is love

724
00:53:07,398 --> 00:53:09,442
So this is love

725
00:53:12,153 --> 00:53:15,114
So this is what makes life

726
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,951
Worthwhile

727
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,411
I'm all aglow

728
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,290
And now I know

729
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:26,208
And now I know

730
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:34,008
The key to our heaven is mine

731
00:53:35,301 --> 00:53:36,552
My heart has wings

732
00:53:39,304 --> 00:53:41,432
And I can fly

733
00:53:43,016 --> 00:53:46,437
I'll touch every star

734
00:53:47,396 --> 00:53:49,440
In the sky

735
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:55,571
So this is the miracle

736
00:53:56,613 --> 00:54:02,786
That I've been dreaming of

737
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:21,847
So this is love

738
00:54:23,348 --> 00:54:24,766
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

739
00:54:25,434 --> 00:54:26,685
What's the matter?

740
00:54:26,768 --> 00:54:27,727
It's midnight.

741
00:54:28,395 --> 00:54:31,189
- Yes, so it is, but--
- Goodbye.

742
00:54:31,857 --> 00:54:32,983
No, no, wait. You can't go now. It's only--

743
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:36,403
Oh, I must, please. Please, I must.

744
00:54:36,778 --> 00:54:37,988
- But why?
- Well, I...I...

745
00:54:38,697 --> 00:54:41,032
Oh, the Prince. I haven't met the Prince.

746
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:43,493
The Prince? But didn't you know--

747
00:54:44,077 --> 00:54:47,872
- Goodbye!
- No, wait. Come back.

748
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,290
Please come back!

749
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:52,127
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?

750
00:54:52,627 --> 00:54:53,712
Wait! Please wait!

751
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:55,964
Goodbye.

752
00:54:57,757 --> 00:54:58,925
I say, young lady!

753
00:54:59,008 --> 00:55:00,552
- Who is she?
- Wait!

754
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:02,387
- Who is she?
- Isn't she lovely?

755
00:55:06,975 --> 00:55:08,184
Mademoiselle!

756
00:55:08,768 --> 00:55:10,311
See rita!

757
00:55:12,438 --> 00:55:14,274
Just a moment!

758
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:16,192
Stop! Stop!

759
00:55:18,486 --> 00:55:21,614
Stop that coach! Close those gates!

760
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:26,119
Follow that coach!

761
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:28,371
Open the gates!

762
00:56:06,367 --> 00:56:07,118
I'm sorry.

763
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,913
I... I guess I forgot about everything,

764
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:13,624
even the time, but...

765
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:17,628
but it was so wonderful.

766
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:20,673
And he was so handsome,

767
00:56:21,257 --> 00:56:22,424
and when we danced--

768
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,678
Oh, I’m sure that even the Prince himself...

769
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:28,013
couldn't have been more... more--

770
00:56:30,224 --> 00:56:32,184
Oh, well. It's over and--

771
00:56:32,393 --> 00:56:33,394
Cinderelly! Look, look!

772
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,646
- A slipper, a slipper!
- Yeah, a slipper.

773
00:56:36,105 --> 00:56:37,648
- Your slipper, Cinderelly.
- Yeah, your slipper.

774
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,274
Oh!

775
00:56:42,403 --> 00:56:43,362
Thank you.

776
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:47,282
Thank you so much, for everything.

777
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:01,839
Your Majesty, I see no point
in beating about the bush.

778
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,091
I regret to inform you, Sire,

779
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:06,301
that the young lady has disappeared...

780
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:08,720
leaving behind only this glass slipper.

781
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:11,306
Yes, I'll do it.

782
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:16,561
No, I just can't.

783
00:57:44,297 --> 00:57:46,841
Well? Come in.

784
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:49,135
Come in!

785
00:57:49,552 --> 00:57:52,347
- Your Majesty--
- So... he's proposed already!

786
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:53,890
- Tell me all about it.- Well, Sire--

787
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,308
Who is she?
Where does she live?

788
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:57,394
- Well, I didn't get a chance--- No matter.

789
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:59,187
We've more important things to discuss.

790
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:03,191
Arrangements for the wedding,
invitations, a national holiday.

791
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:06,027
- All that sort of thing.
- But, but, Sire--

792
00:58:06,694 --> 00:58:08,863
Here, here, have a cigar. Take a few more.

793
00:58:09,405 --> 00:58:10,281
ha...

794
00:58:10,323 --> 00:58:11,157
But, but, but--

795
00:58:11,366 --> 00:58:13,159
Better practice passing these out, eh?

796
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:17,247
But, but, but, if you'd... only listen!

797
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:18,915
And for you, my friend...

798
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:20,667
Your, Your Majesty, p-p-please.

799
00:58:21,209 --> 00:58:22,085
a knighthood!

800
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:24,629
I hereby dub you Sir...

801
00:58:25,463 --> 00:58:26,297
Uh... um...

802
00:58:27,006 --> 00:58:29,175
By the way, what title would you like?

803
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:32,512
- Sire, she got away, sir.
- She got away?

804
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:35,348
A peculiar title, but if that’s what you--

805
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:37,600
She what?

806
00:58:38,226 --> 00:58:41,020
Why you, you... you traitor!

807
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:43,981
Now, Sire, remember your...
your blood pressure.

808
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:47,193
Traitor!

809
00:58:49,028 --> 00:58:49,737
No, Sire, no!

810
00:58:51,072 --> 00:58:52,198
Sabotage!

811
00:58:54,116 --> 00:58:55,618
You were in league with the Prince all along!

812
00:58:56,327 --> 00:58:57,286
I tried to stop her...

813
00:58:57,537 --> 00:58:59,914
but she vanished into thin air!

814
00:59:00,164 --> 00:59:02,708
- A likely story!
- But it’s true, Sire!

815
00:59:03,334 --> 00:59:05,294
All we could find was this glass slipper.

816
00:59:05,878 --> 00:59:07,672
The whole thing was a plot!

817
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:10,758
But, Sire, he loves her.

818
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:13,344
He won't rest 'til he finds her.

819
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:15,096
He's determined to marry her.

820
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:19,392
What? What did you say?

821
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:23,687
The Prince, Sire, swears
he'll marry none but the girl...

822
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:26,816
- who fits this slipper.
- He said that, did he?

823
00:59:27,983 --> 00:59:30,402
Ha-ha! We've got him!

824
00:59:30,986 --> 00:59:32,321
Yahoo-o-o!

825
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:39,078
But, Sire, this slipper
may fit any number of girls.

826
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:41,747
That's his problem. He's given his word.

827
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:44,249
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, no, Your Highness.

828
00:59:45,376 --> 00:59:46,877
I'll have nothing to do with it.

829
00:59:47,336 --> 00:59:49,463
You'll try this on every maid in my kingdom,

830
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:51,507
and if the shoe fits...

831
00:59:53,008 --> 00:59:54,093
bring her in!

832
00:59:54,385 --> 00:59:57,513
Y-y-yes, Your Majesty.

833
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:13,403
Cinderella! Cinderella?

834
01:00:14,696 --> 01:00:15,822
Cinderella!

835
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:17,366
- Oh, where is that--
- Yes? Here I am.

836
01:00:18,158 --> 01:00:20,160
Oh... my daughters, where are they?

837
01:00:20,494 --> 01:00:22,079
I... I think they're still in bed.

838
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:24,915
Oh... Well, don't just stand there.

839
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:28,001
Bring up the breakfast
trays at once, and hurry!

840
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:31,171
Uh-oh! Wonder what's the matter.

841
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,131
Duh... duh... What's the matter with her?

842
01:00:33,507 --> 01:00:34,341
I don’t know. Let's find out.

843
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:35,550
Come on!

844
01:00:43,892 --> 01:00:45,685
Drizella! Drizella!

845
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:47,646
What?

846
01:00:48,355 --> 01:00:50,023
Get up! Quick! This instant!

847
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:51,650
We haven't a moment to lose.

848
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:56,071
Anastasia? Anastasia.

849
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:00,492
Get up, Anastasia!

850
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:03,411
What for? Why?

851
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:07,582
Oh, everyone's talking about it
the whole kingdom. Hurry now!

852
01:01:07,874 --> 01:01:09,334
- He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?

853
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:12,462
The Grand Duke. He's been hunting all night.

854
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:14,214
- Hunting?
- For that girl.

855
01:01:14,923 --> 01:01:16,883
The one who lost her slipper
at the ball last night.

856
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:19,219
They say he's madly in love with her.

857
01:01:19,552 --> 01:01:22,597
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no! The Prince!

858
01:01:23,515 --> 01:01:25,642
The Prince!

859
01:01:27,227 --> 01:01:28,603
You clumsy little fool!

860
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,148
Clean that up, and then
help my daughters dress.

861
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:33,483
What for?

862
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:37,987
If he’s in love with that girl,
why should we even bother?

863
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:39,781
Now, you two, listen to me!

864
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:43,368
There is still a chance
that one of you can get him.

865
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:45,411
What? One of us?

866
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:47,663
Why, Mother, what do you mean?

867
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:51,167
Just this. No one, not even the Prince,

868
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,211
knows who that girl is.

869
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:54,629
We do! We do! Cinderelly, Cinder--

870
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:57,673
The glass slipper is their only clue.

871
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:02,094
The Duke has been ordered to try it
on every girl in the kingdom,

872
01:02:02,595 --> 01:02:05,723
and if one can be found
whom the slipper fits, then...

873
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:10,436
by the King's command, that girl
shall be the Prince's bride.

874
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,648
Bride... Bride!

875
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,483
Cinderella, get my things together.

876
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:17,526
Never mind her, mend these right away!

877
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,362
Not until she irons my dress!

878
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:21,864
- Mend these.
- After she's brushed my shoes.

879
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:23,866
But first get my new--

880
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:27,620
W-w-what's the matter with her?

881
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,998
- Wake up, stupid!
- We've gotta get dressed!

882
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,126
Dressed... Oh, yes...

883
01:02:35,044 --> 01:02:37,796
We must get dressed. It would never do...

884
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,173
for the Duke to see me looking like this.

885
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,758
Mother, did you see what she did?

886
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,593
- Are you just going to let--
- Quiet!

887
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,139
So this is love

888
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,822
- What she gonna do?
- Shhh! I don't know.

889
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,449
Gotta watch her. Come on!

890
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:28,221
la, la...

891
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:31,350
- Cinderelly, Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!

892
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,811
- Look out, look out!
- So this is the miracle

893
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,314
That I've been dreaming of

894
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,150
- Cinderelly, look out!
- Behind you, behind you!

895
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,735
- Look behind you, Cinderelly!
- What?

896
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,656
Oh! Oh, no!

897
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,533
No, please!

898
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:51,536
Oh, you can’t! You just can't!

899
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:52,787
Let me out! You must let me out!

900
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,956
oh... ho...

901
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,625
You can't keep me in here!

902
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,628
Please...

903
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:02,255
No, no! She can't do it!

904
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,257
She can't lock up Cinderelly! I'm gonna--

905
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,635
Oh, please, please.

906
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,972
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.

907
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:17,729
Whoa!

908
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,487
He's-a here, he's-a here! A Duke-Duke!

909
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:28,656
- Duh... duh... a who?
- A Grand Duke with the slipper.

910
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,743
- Gotta get that key quick!
- Zuk-zuk key-key quick-quick.

911
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,205
Oh, Mother, Mother. He's here!

912
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:37,832
- He's here!
- The Grand Duke!

913
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,460
Do I look all right? I'm so excited, I just--

914
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:43,087
Girls, now remember...

915
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,548
this is your last chance. Don't fail me.

916
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:53,806
Announcing His Imperial
Grace, the Grand Duke.

917
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,893
You honour our humble home, m'Lord.

918
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,227
Ahem. Quite so.

919
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,855
May I present my daughters,

920
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,233
Drizella and Anastasia.

921
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,484
Your Grace.

922
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:09,405
Ladies, charmed I'm sure.

923
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,617
His Grace will read a royal proclamation.

924
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,165
All loyal subjects of His
Imperial Majesty are hereby...

925
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,500
notified by royal proclamation
in regard to a certain...

926
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:28,299
glass... slipper.
It is upon this day decreed--

927
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,301
Why, that's my slipper!

928
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,721
Well, I like that! It... it's my slipper!

929
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,765
No, No! Cinderelly's
slipper! Cinderelly's slip--

930
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,935
- How can she--- Girls, girls, girls!

931
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,146
Your manners.

932
01:05:43,647 --> 01:05:45,316
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.

933
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:46,609
Please continue.

934
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,319
Yes, quite so.

935
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,906
It is upon this day decreed
that a quest be instituted...

936
01:05:53,365 --> 01:05:54,825
throughout the length
and breadth of our domain...

937
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:58,495
the sole and express purpose
of said quest to be as follows:

938
01:06:01,081 --> 01:06:02,916
That every single maiden
in our beloved kingdom,

939
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,127
without prearranged exception,
shall try upon her foot...

940
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:06,754
this aforementioned slipper of glass.

941
01:06:06,962 --> 01:06:08,505
And should one be found upon whose foot said
slipper...

942
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:10,132
shall properly fit...

943
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,597
such maiden shall be acclaimed
the object of this search...

944
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:18,182
and immediately forthwith
shall be looked upon...

945
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:19,725
as the one and only true love
of His Royal Highness,

946
01:06:20,058 --> 01:06:21,560
our beloved son and heir,

947
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,313
the Noble Prince.

948
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,982
Said Noble Prince will humbly
and upon bended knee...

949
01:06:27,357 --> 01:06:28,859
beg, request, or if need be, implore...

950
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,571
said maiden, that they
grant her hand in marriage.

951
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,198
Well...Whereupon,

952
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:37,117
should the aforementioned maide
look with favour upon his suit,

953
01:06:37,492 --> 01:06:38,618
then shall the happy couple
pledge their troth...

954
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:40,746
on... uh...

955
01:06:41,621 --> 01:06:44,583
And in due course,
upon the inevitable demise...

956
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:46,251
of His Most Gracious
and August Majesty, the King,

957
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,420
succeed to the throne,
there to rule over all the land...

958
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:49,963
as Kingsland Queen of our beloved kingdom.

959
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,507
Oh... So be it.

960
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:57,637
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.

961
01:06:58,096 --> 01:06:59,347
May we offer you some tea?

962
01:06:59,931 --> 01:07:01,766
What? Tea?

963
01:07:03,268 --> 01:07:04,436
Thank you, madam, no.

964
01:07:05,812 --> 01:07:07,814
We must proceed with the... the fitting.

965
01:07:08,189 --> 01:07:10,692
Of course. Anastasia, dear.

966
01:07:14,362 --> 01:07:17,115
There! I knew it was my slipper.

967
01:07:17,824 --> 01:07:19,075
Exactly my size.

968
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:21,494
I always wear the same size.

969
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:23,371
As soon as I saw it, I said--

970
01:07:23,913 --> 01:07:27,667
Oh! Well... it... it may be
a trifle snug today.

971
01:07:28,293 --> 01:07:30,128
You know how it is... dancing all night.

972
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:32,088
I can't understand why.

973
01:07:33,214 --> 01:07:34,632
It's always fit perfectly before.

974
01:07:35,842 --> 01:07:37,385
I don’t think you're half trying!

975
01:07:37,802 --> 01:07:40,138
- Mother, can you--
- Shhh. Be quiet, my dear.

976
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:43,850
We mustn't disturb His Grace.

977
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:47,353
Young man, are you sure you're
trying it on the right foot?

978
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:52,942
Oh, it's the right foot, but
it must have shrunk or something.

979
01:07:53,443 --> 01:07:55,653
A glass shoe isn't always reliable.

980
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:57,697
Come on, Gus-Gus. Hurry! Up the stairs!

981
01:07:58,197 --> 01:07:59,574
Up the stairs!

982
01:08:35,484 --> 01:08:37,319
Why can't you hold still a minute?

983
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,196
Oh, my word!

984
01:08:39,822 --> 01:08:40,573
Enough of this!

985
01:08:43,617 --> 01:08:44,952
The next young lady, please.

986
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:46,996
Hear that, Gus? Hear that?

987
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:49,039
- Yup.
- Quick. Gotta hurry!

988
01:08:56,046 --> 01:08:56,922
Come on, come on! Hurry!

989
01:08:58,966 --> 01:09:09,560
. Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus. Aw, come on.
Look, Look. It's just up there

990
01:09:09,893 --> 01:09:10,978
Come on!

991
01:09:19,778 --> 01:09:20,571
Us a-comin', Cinderelly.

992
01:09:20,779 --> 01:09:22,531
Us a-comin'! Us'll get you out.

993
01:09:22,781 --> 01:09:26,326
You've got the key.
How did you ever manage it?

994
01:09:27,786 --> 01:09:31,206
Lucifer! Let him go, Lucifer!

995
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:33,500
Please, let him go!

996
01:09:34,626 --> 01:09:36,962
- Let him go.
- Let him go! Let him out!

997
01:09:37,296 --> 01:09:39,881
Let him out! Here! Here, R-ucifee!

998
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:19,963
Bruno!

999
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:21,798
Yes! Bruno!

1000
01:10:22,841 --> 01:10:24,801
Quick! Get Bruno! Get Bruno!

1001
01:10:45,863 --> 01:10:48,866
Oh, of all the stupid little idiots!

1002
01:10:49,409 --> 01:10:51,035
I'll do it myself!

1003
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:53,121
Get away from me!

1004
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:54,998
I'll make it fit!

1005
01:10:57,417 --> 01:10:58,334
There!

1006
01:10:58,668 --> 01:10:59,836
- It fit!
- It fits?

1007
01:11:09,303 --> 01:11:13,266
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.

1008
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:15,143
It shan't happen again.

1009
01:11:15,434 --> 01:11:16,394
Precisely, madam.

1010
01:11:43,254 --> 01:11:45,297
Come on, come on! Get up, Gus-Gus!

1011
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:46,340
Get up, get up!

1012
01:11:46,715 --> 01:11:48,050
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

1013
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:50,177
Let go, let go!

1014
01:11:55,933 --> 01:11:59,103
You are the only ladies
of the household, I hope-- I presume.

1015
01:11:59,353 --> 01:12:00,312
There’s no one else, Your Grace.

1016
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:02,231
Quite so. Good day.

1017
01:12:02,606 --> 01:12:03,941
- Good day!
- Your Grace!

1018
01:12:04,775 --> 01:12:06,110
Your Grace!

1019
01:12:06,193 --> 01:12:08,904
Please! Wait! May I try it on?

1020
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:10,906
Oh, pay no attention to her.

1021
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:13,242
- It's only Cinderella.- Our scullery maid.

1022
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:14,743
- From the kitchen.
- It's ridiculous.

1023
01:12:14,785 --> 01:12:15,869
- Impossible.
- She’s out of her mind.

1024
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:18,288
Yes, yes. Just an imaginative child.

1025
01:12:18,831 --> 01:12:21,667
Madam, my orders were every maiden!

1026
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:24,211
Come, my child.

1027
01:12:40,102 --> 01:12:43,313
Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no!

1028
01:12:43,522 --> 01:12:46,942
Oh, no! This is terrible. The King!

1029
01:12:47,609 --> 01:12:48,402
What will he say?

1030
01:12:49,444 --> 01:12:50,612
What will he do?

1031
01:12:51,154 --> 01:12:52,656
But perhaps, if it would help--

1032
01:12:53,115 --> 01:12:56,201
No, no. Nothing can help now, nothing.

1033
01:12:56,368 --> 01:12:58,203
But, you see, I have the other slipper.

1034
01:13:36,741 --> 01:13:41,037
Have faith in dreams and someday

1035
01:13:41,996 --> 01:13:47,585
Your rainbow will come smiling through

1036
01:13:47,919 --> 01:13:52,006
No matter how your heart is grieving

1037
01:13:52,548 --> 01:13:55,885
If you keep on believing

1038
01:13:56,844 --> 01:14:03,393
The dreams that you wish
will come true.
