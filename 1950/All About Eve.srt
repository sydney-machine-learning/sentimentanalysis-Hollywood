1
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:10,983
The Sarah Siddons Award
is perhaps unknown to you.

2
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,986
It has been spared the sensational publicity

3
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,489
of such questionable honours
as the Pulitzer Prize

4
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:22,452
and those awards presented annually
by that... film society.

5
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:26,497
The distinguished-Iooking gentleman
is an extremely old actor.

6
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:30,001
Being an actor,
he will go on speakingfor some time.

7
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:33,170
It is not important thatyou hear what he says.

8
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:37,549
However, it is important thatyou know
where you are and why you are here.

9
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:41,219
This is the dining hall
of the Sarah Siddons Society.

10
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:46,808
It is the annual banquet and presentation
of the highest honour our theatre has:

11
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:50,519
the Sarah Siddons Awardfor
Distinguished Achievement.

12
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:53,480
These hallowed walls,
indeed many of these faces,

13
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:57,734
have looked upon Modjeska,
Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske.

14
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:01,071
Mansfield's voice filled this room.

15
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,991
It is unlikely that the windows
have been opened since his death.

16
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:09,912
The minor awards, as you can see,
have already been presented.

17
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:13,457
Minor awards are for such
as the writer and director,

18
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,251
since they merely construct a tower

19
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:20,255
so that the world can applaud
a light which flashes on top of it.

20
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:24,717
And no brighter light has ever
dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington.

21
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:28,179
Eve... but more of Eve later.

22
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:30,389
All about Eve, in fact.

23
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:36,270
To those who do not read, attend the theatre,
listen to unsponsored radio programmes

24
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:39,106
or know anything of the world
in which you live,

25
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:42,567
it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself.

26
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,819
My name is Addison DeWitt.

27
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:50,616
My native habitat is the theatre.
In it, I toil not. Neither do I spin.

28
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,202
I am a critic and commentator.

29
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:55,954
I am essential to the theatre.

30
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:58,123
This is Karen Richards.

31
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:02,711
She is the wife of a playwright,
therefore of the theatre by marriage.

32
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:09,216
Nothing in her background should have
brought her closer to the stage than Row E.

33
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,346
However, during her senior year at Radcliffe,
Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama.

34
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,558
The following year
Karen became Mrs Lloyd Richards.

35
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:22,354
There are, in general,
two types of theatrical producers.

36
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:26,941
One has a great many wealthy friends
who will risk a tax-deductible loss.

37
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,485
This type is interested in art.

38
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:33,947
The other is one to whom each production
means potential ruin or fortune.

39
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,116
This type is out to make a buck.

40
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,577
Meet Max Fabian.

41
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,707
He is the producer of the play which has won
for Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award.

42
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:49,253
Margo Channing is a star of the theatre.

43
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:55,092
She made her first stage appearance at
the age of four in Midsummer Night's Dream.

44
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:59,805
She played a fairy and entered,
quite unexpectedly, stark naked.

45
00:03:59,888 --> 00:04:02,390
She has been a star ever since.

46
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:06,519
Margo is a great star. A true star.

47
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:10,606
She never was or will be
anything less or anything else.

48
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:17,946
Having covered in tedious detail not only
the history of the Sarah Siddons Society,

49
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,535
but also the history of acting since
Thespis first stepped out of the chorus line,

50
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:27,955
our distinguished chairman has finally
arrived at our reason for being here.

51
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:34,378
I have been proud and privileged
to have spent my life in the theatre,

52
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:39,424
a poor player that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage,

53
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:43,052
and I've been honoured to be, for 40 years,

54
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:47,056
chief prompter of the Sarah Siddons Society.

55
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,978
39 times have I placed in deserving hands

56
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:56,690
this highest honour the theatre knows.

57
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:59,693
Surely no actor is older than I.

58
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:02,696
I've earned my place - out of the sun.

59
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:09,827
And never before has this award gone to
anyone younger than its recipient tonight.

60
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,081
How fitting that it should
pass from my hands to hers.

61
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:17,918
Such young hands. Such a young lady.

62
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:22,922
Young in years, but whose heart
is as old as the theatre.

63
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,383
Some of us are privileged to know her.

64
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:28,803
We have seen beyond the beauty and artistry

65
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:32,139
that have made her name
resound through the nation.

66
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:36,143
We know her humility, her devotion,

67
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:38,353
her Ioyalty to her art,

68
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:43,024
her love, her deep and abiding love for us,

69
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:47,820
for what we are and what we do - the theatre.

70
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,698
She has had one wish,

71
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:53,492
one prayer, one dream:

72
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,204
to belong to us.

73
00:05:57,454 --> 00:05:59,831
Tonight her dream has come true,

74
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:03,793
and henceforth
we shall dream the same of her.

75
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:08,589
Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguished
achievement in the theatre,

76
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:12,718
the Sarah Siddons Award...
to Miss Eve Harrington.

77
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:56,967
Eve. Eve, the golden girl. The cover girl.

78
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,513
The girl next door, the girl on the moon.
Time has been good to Eve.

79
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:06,726
Life goes where she goes. She's been
profiled, covered, revealed, reported,

80
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:09,770
what she eats and what
she wears and whom she knows

81
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:13,023
and where she was and
when and where she's going.

82
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:14,942
Eve.

83
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:17,527
You all know all about Eve.

84
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:21,364
What can there be to know
that you don't know?

85
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:25,159
When was it? How long?

86
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,912
It seems a lifetime ago.

87
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:32,583
Lloyd always said that in the theatre a lifetime
was a season and a season a lifetime.

88
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:36,378
It's June now. That was early October.

89
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,464
Only last October.

90
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:45,345
It was a drizzly night.
I remember I asked the taxi to wait.

91
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:53,352
Where was she?

92
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:58,106
Strange. I'd become so accustomed
to seeing her there night after night,

93
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,359
I found myself lookingfor a girl
I'd never spoken to.

94
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:03,945
Wondering where she was.

95
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:11,577
Mrs Richards?

96
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:15,080
There you are.

97
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:19,376
It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being here.

98
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,879
- Why should you think I wouldn't be?
- Why should you be?

99
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:27,675
Six nights a week for weeks of watching even
Margo Channing enter and leave a theatre.

100
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,469
- You don't mind my speaking to you?
- Not at all.

101
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:34,306
I've seen you so often.
It took every bit of courage I could raise.

102
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,975
To speakto just a playwright's wife?

103
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,519
I'm the lowest form of celebrity.

104
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:43,940
You're Margo Channing's best friend.
You and your husband are always with her.

105
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,819
And Mr Sampson. What's he like?

106
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,322
Bill Sampson? He's a director.

107
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,657
- He's the best.
- He'll agree with you.

108
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:58,829
Tell me. What do you do in between
the time Margo goes in and comes out?

109
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:01,414
Just huddle in that doorway and wait?

110
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:04,500
No. I see the play.

111
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:09,297
You see the play? You've seen
every performance of this play?

112
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,423
Yes.

113
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:16,220
But don'tyou find it, apart from
everything else, don'tyou find it expensive?

114
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:19,431
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.

115
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,726
- I'm gonna take you to Margo.
- No.

116
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,480
- Yes. She's got to meetyou.
- No, I'd be imposing on her.

117
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,649
I'd be just another tongue-tied fan.

118
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:32,943
There isn't another like you.
There couldn't be.

119
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:35,779
If I'd known... Some other time.
Looking like this.

120
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:39,449
You look just fine.
By the way, what's your name?

121
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,618
Eve. Eve Harrington.

122
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:48,416
- Good evening, Gus.
- Good evening, Mrs Richards.

123
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,293
- Good night.
- Good night, Gus.

124
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,022
You can breathe it, can'tyou?

125
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:16,775
Like some magic perfume.

126
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,410
Wait right here. Don't run away.

127
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,871
"If the South had won,
you could write plays about the North."

128
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:33,290
- Hi.
- Hello!

129
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:36,168
"I don't think
you can rightly say we lost the war."

130
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:38,837
"We was more starved out, you might say."

131
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,924
"I don't understand all these plays
about love-starved Southern women."

132
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:46,636
"Love is one thing we were
never starved for in the South."

133
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:49,305
Margo's interview with
a reporter from the South.

134
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:52,683
When it gets printed, they're
gonna fire on Gettysburg again.

135
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:56,812
- It was Fort Sumter they fired on.
- I never played Fort Sumter.

136
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:02,442
Honeychild had a point.
Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts.

137
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:06,904
Write me one about a nice, normal woman
who just shoots her husband.

138
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:09,490
- You need new girdles.
- Buy some.

139
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:11,450
- Same size?
- Of course.

140
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,661
I find these wisecracks
increasingly less funny.

141
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:18,957
- Aged in Woodhappens to be a fine play.
- That's my Ioyal little woman.

142
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,543
The critics thought so.
The audiences think so.

143
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:25,255
Packed houses, tickets
four months in advance.

144
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:27,924
I can't see that Lloyd's plays
have hurtyou any.

145
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:32,052
- Easy now.
- Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth.

146
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:37,808
You get me so mad sometimes. Of all
the women with nothing to complain about...

147
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:40,060
- Ain't it the truth?
- Yes, it is.

148
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:42,604
You're talented, famous, wealthy.

149
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:46,899
People waiting around night after night
just to see you. Even in the rain.

150
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:52,404
Autograph fiends. They're not people. Little
beasts that run around in packs like coyotes.

151
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:55,365
- They're your fans.
- They're nobody's fans.

152
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:59,244
They're juvenile delinquents.
They're nobody's audience.

153
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:03,206
They never see a play or a movie.
They're never indoors long enough.

154
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,709
Well, there's one indoors right now.

155
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,254
- I've brought her backto see you.
- You've what?

156
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:13,215
She's just outside the door.

157
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,259
The heave-ho.

158
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:18,011
But you can't put her out. I promised.

159
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:22,891
Margo, you've got to see her. She worships
you. It's like something out of a book.

160
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:25,560
That book is out of print.
Those days are gone.

161
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,854
But if you'd only see her...
You're her whole life.

162
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:32,691
You must have spotted her by now.
She's always there.

163
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:36,904
The mousy one with
the trench coat and the funny hat.

164
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:40,073
How could I miss her?
Every night, every matinée.

165
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:45,703
Come in, Eve.

166
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:51,667
- I thoughtyou'd forgotten about me.
- Not at all.

167
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,919
Margo, this is Eve Harrington.

168
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:56,505
- How do you do, my dear?
- Oh, brother.

169
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:58,548
- Hello, Miss Channing.
- My husband.

170
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:00,759
- Hello, Miss Harrington.
- How do you do?

171
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:04,053
And this is my dear friend
and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

172
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:06,389
- Oh, brother.
- Miss Coonan.

173
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:09,141
- Oh, brother, what?
- When she gets like this,

174
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,435
she starts playing Hamlet's mother.

175
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,314
I'm sure you must have things
to do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear.

176
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:18,900
If I haven't, I'll find
something till you get normal.

177
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:25,156
Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?

178
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,366
Harrington.

179
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:30,202
- I'm so sorry. Won'tyou sit down?
- Thank you.

180
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:37,584
- Would you like a drink?
- I was saying how often you've seen the play.

181
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:39,211
No, thank you.

182
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:41,171
Yes, I've seen every performance.

183
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:45,591
Every performance?
Then am I safe in assuming you like it?

184
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:50,721
- I'd like anything Miss Channing played in.
- Would you really? How sweet.

185
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,974
I doubt very much that
you'd like her in The Hairy Ape.

186
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:56,894
Please don't misunderstand me, Mr Richards.

187
00:13:56,977 --> 00:14:01,731
I think part of Miss Channing's greatness
lies in her ability to pickthe best plays.

188
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:05,985
- Your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it?
- Of course it is.

189
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:09,739
- How did you hear about it?
- There was an item in The Times.

190
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:12,616
I like the title, Footsteps on the Ceiling.

191
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,743
Yes, but let's get backto this one.

192
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:18,038
- Have you really seen every performance?
- Yes.

193
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:20,165
Why? I'm curious.

194
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:25,753
Well, if I didn't come to see the play,
I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.

195
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,591
- There are other plays.
- Not with you in them. Not by Mr Richards.

196
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:34,094
But you must have friends, a home, family?

197
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:38,890
Tell us about it, Eve.

198
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:43,144
- If I only knew how.
- Try.

199
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,939
Well...

200
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:08,417
Well, it started with the play before this one.

201
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,836
- Remembrance.
- Remembrance.

202
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,922
- Did you see it here in New York?
- San Francisco.

203
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:17,509
It was the last week. I went one night.

204
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:20,679
The most important night
of my life... until now.

205
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:24,891
I found myself going the next night
and the next and the next.

206
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:27,226
Every performance.

207
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,105
Then, when the show went East, I went East.

208
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:36,193
- Eve, why don'tyou start at the beginning?
- It couldn't possibly interestyou.

209
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:38,612
Please.

210
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:43,450
I guess it started back home.
Wisconsin, that is.

211
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,910
It was just Mom and Dad and me.

212
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:50,331
I was an only child.
I used to make believe a lot when I was a kid.

213
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:54,418
Acted out all sorts of things.
What they were isn't important.

214
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:59,548
But, somehow, acting and make-believe
began to fill up my life more and more.

215
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,384
It got so I couldn't tell
the real from the unreal.

216
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:06,804
Except that the unreal
seemed more real to me...

217
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:11,934
- I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
- Not at all.

218
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:17,606
Farmers were poor in those days.
That's what Dad was, a farmer.

219
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:19,816
I had to help out.

220
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:27,573
So I quit school, went to Milwaukee,
became a secretary... in a brewery.

221
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:32,953
When you're a secretary in a brewery, it's
hard to make believe you're anything else.

222
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:34,997
Everything is beer.

223
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,000
It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home.

224
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:45,423
And there was a little theatre group there,
like a drop of rain on the desert.

225
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,592
That's where I met Eddie.

226
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,594
He was a radio technician.

227
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:53,389
We played Liliomfor three performances.

228
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,059
I was awful.

229
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,729
Then the war came and we got married.

230
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,897
Eddie was in the air force.

231
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,483
They sent him to the South Pacific.

232
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:11,655
You were with the OWl, weren'tyou,
Mr Richards? That's what Who's Who says.

233
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,618
Well, with Eddie gone,
my life went backto beer.

234
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,954
Except for a letter a week.

235
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:22,332
One week he wrote me
he had leave coming up.

236
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:27,712
I'd saved my money and vacation time
and went to San Francisco to meet him.

237
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,674
But Eddie wasn't there.

238
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:34,676
They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee.

239
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,304
The one that came from Washington.

240
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:40,307
To say that... Eddie wasn't coming at all.

241
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:44,352
That Eddie was dead.

242
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,943
I figured I'd stay in San Francisco.

243
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:56,446
I was alone. I couldn't go back without Eddie.

244
00:17:57,823 --> 00:18:00,408
I found a job, and his insurance helped.

245
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:05,079
And there were theatres in San Francisco.

246
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:09,834
And then, one night, Margo Channing
came to play in Remembrance,

247
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:12,002
and I went to see it.

248
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,215
Well...

249
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:18,425
Here I am.

250
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:28,601
What a story. Everything but
the bloodhounds snapping at her rear end.

251
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:33,439
There are some human experiences that
do not take place in a vaudeville house!

252
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:37,818
And that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian
should understand and respect.

253
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,656
- I want to apologise for Birdie.
- You don't have to apologise for me.

254
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:51,747
I'm sorry if I hurtyour feelings.
It's just my way of talking.

255
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,458
You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan.

256
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,627
Call me Birdie.

257
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,671
And as for being fifth-rate,

258
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:03,967
I closed the first half
for eleven years, and you know it.

259
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:13,475
47 minutes from now my plane takes off
and how do I find you?

260
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,520
- Not ready, looking like a junkyard.
- Thank you so much.

261
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:19,981
Is it sabotage?
Have you no human consideration?

262
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:23,902
- Show me a human and I might have.
- Airlines have clocks, even if you don't.

263
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:27,280
I start shooting a week from Monday.
Zanuck is impatient.

264
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:29,490
Zanuck, Zanuck! What are you two? Lovers?

265
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:32,451
- Only in some ways. You're prettier.
- I'm a junkyard.

266
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:35,829
- Bill. This is Eve Harrington.
- Hi.

267
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:40,500
My wonderful junkyard. The mystery
and dreams you find in a junkyard.

268
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,460
Heaven help me.

269
00:19:42,544 --> 00:19:44,629
I love a psychotic.

270
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:50,342
- Hello. What's your name?
- Eve Harrington.

271
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:53,012
- You've already met.
- Where?

272
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:57,224
- Right here, just a minute ago.
- That's nice.

273
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:03,480
- You're not going, are you?
- I think I'd better.

274
00:20:03,563 --> 00:20:08,192
It's been... I can hardly find
the words to say how it's been.

275
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,277
No, don't go.

276
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:15,365
The four of you must have so much to say
to each other with Mr Sampson leaving.

277
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,744
No, stick around, please.

278
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:24,040
Tell you what. We'll put Stanislavsky
on his plane, then go somewhere and talk.

279
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,918
Well, if I'm not in the way...

280
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:29,086
I won't be a minute.

281
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,217
Lloyd, we've got to go.

282
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:42,182
Good night, Margo.

283
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:45,184
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Not too early.

284
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:52,358
- Good luck, genius.
- Geniuses don't need good luck. I do.

285
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:57,154
- I'm not worried aboutyou.
- Keep the thought.

286
00:20:57,446 --> 00:21:00,490
Good night, Eve.
I hope I see you again soon.

287
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:05,578
- I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinée.
- Not just that way. As a friend.

288
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:07,747
I'd like that.

289
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:14,586
- It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
- I hope so, Mr Richards. Good night.

290
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,047
Good night.

291
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,007
Mrs Richards?

292
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:22,052
I'll never forget this night as long as I live.

293
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:25,513
And I'll never forgetyou
for making it possible.

294
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,812
And I'll never forgetyou, Eve.

295
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:37,149
Where were we going that night, Lloyd and I?

296
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:39,776
Funny, the things you remember...

297
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,945
and the things you don't.

298
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:53,289
So you're going to Hollywood?

299
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,543
- Why?
- I just wondered.

300
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:01,630
- Just wondered what?
- Why?

301
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,842
- Why what?
- Why you have to go out... there.

302
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:10,513
- I don't have to. I want to.
- Is it the money?

303
00:22:11,472 --> 00:22:13,682
80%of it'll go for taxes.

304
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,562
Then why? Why, if you're the most
successful young director in the theatre...

305
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:21,231
The theatre. The theatre.

306
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:24,984
What rules say the theatre exists
only within some ugly buildings

307
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:27,862
crowded into one
square mile of New York City?

308
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:30,031
Or London, Paris or Vienna?

309
00:22:32,074 --> 00:22:34,660
Listen, Junior, and learn.

310
00:22:34,743 --> 00:22:39,664
Do you wanna know what the theatre is?
A flea circus. Also opera.

311
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,501
Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets,

312
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:47,880
Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy,
a one-man band - all theatre.

313
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:52,968
Wherever there's magic and make-believe
and an audience, there's theatre.

314
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:57,139
Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger.

315
00:22:57,222 --> 00:23:01,518
Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford.
Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable.

316
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:04,729
Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse -
all theatre.

317
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:08,274
You don't understand them all.
You don't like them all.

318
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:13,487
Why should you? The theatre's for everybody
- you included - but not exclusively.

319
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,240
So, don't approve or disapprove.

320
00:23:16,323 --> 00:23:20,160
It may not be your theatre,
but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere.

321
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:22,746
I just asked a simple question.

322
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:26,541
And I shot my mouth off.

323
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:29,710
Nothing personal, Junior. No offence.

324
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:35,174
It's just that there's so much bushwa in
this ivory greenroom they call the theatre,

325
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:37,676
sometimes it gets up around my chin.

326
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:41,179
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay out there.

327
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:44,933
- It's only a one-picture deal.
- So few come back.

328
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:50,896
I read George Jean Nathan every week.

329
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,400
- Also Addison DeWitt.
- Every day.

330
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:58,987
You didn't have to tell me.

331
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,156
It's the latest thing - one earring.

332
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:05,243
If it isn't, it's going to be.
I can't find the other one.

333
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,870
Throw that dreary letter away. It bores me.

334
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:11,165
- Where do you suppose it could be?
- It'll show up.

335
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:14,460
I give up. Look in the wigs.
Maybe it got caught in one.

336
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:17,379
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in.

337
00:24:17,462 --> 00:24:20,382
- Where's my coat?
- Right where you left it.

338
00:24:23,635 --> 00:24:25,720
The seams.

339
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,181
He can't take his eyes off my legs.

340
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:31,350
Like a nylon lemon peel.

341
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:34,603
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously.

342
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:36,772
Here we go.

343
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:41,443
Got any messages?
What do you want me to tell Tyrone Power?

344
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:44,862
Just give him my phone number.
I'll tell him myself.

345
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,615
Kill the people.

346
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,911
- You gotyour key?
- See you at home.

347
00:24:56,999 --> 00:25:00,752
I have a suggestion.
There's really not very much time left.

348
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:03,546
I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet.

349
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,050
And I could take care of everything here
and meetyou at the gate with the ticket...

350
00:25:08,134 --> 00:25:10,177
if you'd like.

351
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:12,137
I think we'd like very much.

352
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:14,723
- Sure you won't mind?
- Of course not.

353
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:28,778
- She's quite a girl, this whatshername.
- Eve. I'd forgotten they grewthat way.

354
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,948
That lack of pretence,
that strange directness and understanding.

355
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,701
Did she tell you about
the theatre and what it meant?

356
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,203
No, I told her. I sounded off.

357
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,247
All the religions in the world rolled into one,

358
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,791
and we're gods and goddesses.

359
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,546
Isn't it silly? Suddenly I've developed
a big, protective feeling toward her.

360
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:51,340
A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle.

361
00:25:56,803 --> 00:26:01,182
- Take care of yourself out there.
- They have the Indians pretty well in hand.

362
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:05,645
- Bill, don't get stuck on some glamour puss.
- I'll try.

363
00:26:05,728 --> 00:26:09,482
You're not much of a bargain. You're
conceited, thoughtless and messy.

364
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:14,778
- Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- You're a setup for some young babe.

365
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:17,406
How childish are you gonna get
before you stop it?

366
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:20,200
I don't wanna be childish.
I'd settle for a few years.

367
00:26:20,283 --> 00:26:22,452
And cut that out right now.

368
00:26:22,535 --> 00:26:25,621
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

369
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:28,165
As of this moment, you're six years old.

370
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:30,960
All ready.

371
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:49,060
Thanks for your help. Good luck.

372
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,312
Goodbye, Mr Sampson.

373
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:54,314
- Knit me a muffler?
- Call me when you get in.

374
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:12,164
Hey, Junior!

375
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:17,711
Keep your eye on her. Don't let her get Ionely.
She's a loose lamb in a jungle.

376
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:19,880
Don't worry.

377
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:38,397
That same night, we sent for Eve's things...
her few pitiful possessions.

378
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,983
She moved into the little guest room
on the top floor.

379
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:50,282
The next three weeks were out of a fairy tale,
and I was Cinderella in the last act.

380
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:56,079
Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother,
friend, psychiatrist and cop.

381
00:27:57,831 --> 00:27:59,875
The honeymoon was on.

382
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,604
One more?

383
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:10,773
From now on it isn't applause -

384
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:14,193
just something to do
till the aisles get cleared.

385
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:18,113
What, again?

386
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:25,411
I could watch you play that last scene
a thousand times, cry every time.

387
00:29:25,912 --> 00:29:29,332
Performance number 1,000 of this one,
if I play it that long,

388
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:32,751
will take place in a well-padded booby hatch.

389
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,799
I must say, you can certainly tell
Mr Sampson's been gone a month.

390
00:29:39,883 --> 00:29:42,010
You certainly can.

391
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:45,930
Especially if you're me
between now and tomorrow morning.

392
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:49,266
You bought the new girdles a size smaller.
I can feel it.

393
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,852
Something maybe grew a size larger.

394
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:55,397
You can get into one of those girdles
and act for two and a half hours.

395
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:59,109
I couldn't get into the girdle
in two and a half hours.

396
00:30:04,948 --> 00:30:08,492
You haven't noticed my latest bit
of interior decorating.

397
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:12,329
But you've done so much. What's new?

398
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:14,915
The curtains. I made them myself.

399
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,878
They're lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?

400
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:21,379
Adorable.

401
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:25,633
We now got everything a dressing room
needs except a basketball hoop.

402
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:28,052
Just because you can't even work a zipper!

403
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:31,555
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I appreciate it.

404
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:34,433
I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress.

405
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:38,854
- Don't bother. Mrs Brown will be along soon.
- No trouble at all.

406
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:47,361
May I be so bold as to say something?

407
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:51,198
- Have you ever heard of the word "union"?
- Behind in your dues? How much?

408
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,743
- I haven't got a union. I'm slave labour.
- Well?

409
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:57,954
But the wardrobe women have got one
and, next to a tenor,

410
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,042
a wardrobe woman is the
touchiest thing in show business.

411
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:06,212
She's got two things to do:
carry clothes and press 'em wrong.

412
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:09,548
And don't let anybody try to muscle in.

413
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:20,475
Eve.

414
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:26,606
We'd better let Mrs Brown
pick up the wardrobe.

415
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:58,343
- Hello.
- We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills.

416
00:31:58,427 --> 00:32:03,681
- Call? What call?
- Is this Templeton 89970? Miss Channing?

417
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:06,017
Yes, it is, but I don't understand.

418
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,188
We are ready with the call you placedfor
12 midnight, California time, to Mr Sampson.

419
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:14,149
- I placed?
- Go ahead, please.

420
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:17,819
Margo, what a wonderful surprise.

421
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:21,197
What a thoughtful, ever-Iovin' thing to do.

422
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:24,909
Bill. Have I gone crazy, Bill?

423
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:27,620
- You're my girl, aren'tyou?
- That I am.

424
00:32:27,703 --> 00:32:29,789
Then you're crazy.

425
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:34,126
- When are you coming back?
- I leave in a week.

426
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:37,004
The picture's wrapped up.
We previewed last night.

427
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:39,339
Oh, those previews.

428
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:43,510
Like opening out of town, but terrifying.
There's nothing you can do.

429
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:45,720
You're trapped. You're in a tin can.

430
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,475
In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped
in a Navajo blanket, I wantyou home.

431
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:56,396
- You in a hurry?
- In a big hurry, so be quick about it.

432
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,441
Goodbye, darling. Sleep tight.

433
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:02,444
Hey, wait a minute.
You haven't even said ityet.

434
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:07,490
Now, Bill. You know how much I do,
but over a phone...

435
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:10,701
Now, really. That's kids' stuff.

436
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:14,538
Kids' stuff or not. It doesn't happen
every day and I wanna hear it.

437
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:17,708
- And if you won't say it, you can sing it.
- Sing it?

438
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:20,710
Sure, like the Western Union boys used to do.

439
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,966
Bill...

440
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,010
It's your birthday.

441
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:35,265
And who remembered it?
Who was there on the dot at12 midnight?

442
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,309
Happy birthday, darling.

443
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:40,770
The reading could've been better,
but you said it.

444
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:43,106
Now "many happy returns of the day".

445
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:46,109
Many happy returns of the day.

446
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:51,238
- I get a party, don't I?
- Of course. Birthday and coming home.

447
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:55,200
- Who will I ask?
- I know all about the party. Eve wrote me.

448
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,913
- She did?
- She hasn't missed a week since I left.

449
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,707
But you know that.
You probably tell her what to write.

450
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:07,253
- I sent her a list of guests, so check with her.
- Yeah, I will.

451
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,923
- How is Eve? OK?
- OK.

452
00:34:11,006 --> 00:34:13,717
- I love you.
- I'll check with Eve.

453
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:19,306
I love you too. Good night, darling.

454
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:21,766
See ya.

455
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:08,851
Birdie.

456
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:12,187
You don't like Eve, do you?

457
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:14,565
You want an argument or an answer?

458
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:17,275
- An answer.
- No.

459
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,861
- Why not?
- Now you want an argument.

460
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:24,115
- She works hard.
- Night and day.

461
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:28,578
- She's Ioyal and efficient.
- Like an agent with only one client.

462
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:32,957
She thinks only of me,

463
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:35,834
doesn't she?

464
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:39,421
Well, let's say she thinks
only aboutya, anyway.

465
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,507
- How do you mean that?
- I'll tell ya how.

466
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:45,134
Like...

467
00:35:45,218 --> 00:35:47,220
Like she's studying you.

468
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:50,514
Like you was a play, or a book,
or a set of blueprints.

469
00:35:50,598 --> 00:35:52,808
How you walk, talk, eat, think...

470
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:56,895
I'm sure that's flattering.
There's nothing wrong with it.

471
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,692
Good morning. Well, what do
you think of my elegant new suit?

472
00:36:02,776 --> 00:36:05,194
It looks much better on you than it did on me.

473
00:36:05,278 --> 00:36:10,074
I can imagine. All it needed was
a little taking in here and letting out there.

474
00:36:10,157 --> 00:36:15,329
- Are you sure you won't want ityourself?
- Quite sure. I find it too seventeenish for me.

475
00:36:15,412 --> 00:36:17,748
Come now, as though you were an old lady.

476
00:36:17,831 --> 00:36:20,333
I'm on my way. Is there anything else?

477
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,836
- That script to take to the Guild.
- I've got it.

478
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:25,463
And those cheques for the income-tax man.

479
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:27,632
Right here.

480
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:31,468
It seems I can't think of a thing
you haven't thought of.

481
00:36:31,552 --> 00:36:34,263
That's my job. See you at teatime.

482
00:36:36,848 --> 00:36:38,266
Eve?

483
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:43,980
Did you place a call from me to Bill
for midnight California time?

484
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:48,276
- Golly, I forgot to tell you!
- Yes, dear, you forgot all about it.

485
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,195
I was sure you'd want to, being his birthday.

486
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:56,116
You've been so busy lately. Last night
I meant to tell you before you went out.

487
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,785
I guess I was asleep when you got home.

488
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:02,205
Yes, I guess you were.
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.

489
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:07,502
Mr Sampson's birthday, I couldn't forget that.
You'd never forgive me.

490
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:17,844
As a matter of fact,
I sent him a telegram myself.

491
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:49,332
Bill's welcome-home birthday party...
a night to go down in history.

492
00:37:49,415 --> 00:37:54,044
Even before the party started,
I could smell disaster in the air.

493
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:59,799
I knew it. I sensed it even as lfinished
dressing for that blasted party.

494
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:03,887
- You all put together?
- My back's open.

495
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:07,974
- Extra help get here?
- There's some characters

496
00:38:08,057 --> 00:38:11,936
dressed as maids and butlers.
Did you call the William Morris Agency?

497
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:15,314
You're not funny. Actors would cost less.
How about the food?

498
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:18,025
The caterer had to go back
for the hors d'oeuvres.

499
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,987
That French ventriloquist taughtyou a lot.

500
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:25,948
There was nothing he didn't know.

501
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:32,997
There's a message from the bartender.

502
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,750
"Does Miss Channing knowthat
she ordered domestic gin by mistake?"

503
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,628
The only thing I ordered
by mistake is the guests.

504
00:38:39,711 --> 00:38:42,714
They don't care what they drink
as long as it burns.

505
00:38:42,797 --> 00:38:45,717
- Where's Bill? He's late.
- Late for what?

506
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,096
- Don't be dense. The party.
- I ain't dense. He's been here for 20 minutes.

507
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:54,141
Well, I certainly think it's odd
he hasn't even come up to...

508
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,410
The cameraman said:

509
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:18,705
"Even De Mille couldn't see anything
looking through the wrong end!" So...

510
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,875
Don't let me kill the point.
Or isn't it a story for grown-ups?

511
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:25,169
You've heard it. I looked through
the wrong end of the camera.

512
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:29,382
Remind me to tell you about the time
I looked into the heart of an artichoke.

513
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:33,927
- I'd like to hear it.
- Some snowy night in front of the fire.

514
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:37,139
Meanwhile, would you check
about the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?

515
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:40,517
The caterer forgot them.
The varnish wasn't dry or something.

516
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,685
Of course.

517
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:55,739
Looks like I'm going
to have a fancy party.

518
00:39:55,822 --> 00:39:59,659
- I thoughtyou were going to be late.
- Well, I'm guest of honour.

519
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:01,786
I had no idea you were even here.

520
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,039
I ran into Eve
and she told me you were dressing.

521
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:07,625
That's never stopped you before.

522
00:40:09,085 --> 00:40:12,713
She wanted to know about Hollywood.
She seemed so interested...

523
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:16,883
- She's a girl of so many interests.
- It's a pretty rare quality these days.

524
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:20,428
- A girl of so many rare qualities.
- So she seems.

525
00:40:20,512 --> 00:40:22,806
So you've pointed out so often.

526
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:24,932
So many qualities so often.

527
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:29,312
Her Ioyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth
and affection, and so young.

528
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:31,480
So young and so fair.

529
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:35,692
I can't believe you're making this up.

530
00:40:35,776 --> 00:40:38,904
It sounds like something
out of an old Clyde Fitch play.

531
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:42,866
Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so,
was well before my time.

532
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:47,245
I always deny thatyou were in Our American
Cousin the night Lincoln was shot.

533
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:50,331
- I don't thinkthat's funny.
- Of course it is.

534
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,000
This is all too laughable to be anything else.

535
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,544
You know what I feel
about your age obsession.

536
00:40:55,627 --> 00:41:00,423
And this getting into a jealous froth because
I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid.

537
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:02,926
- 20!
- 30 minutes, 40 minutes. What of it?

538
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:05,511
Stage-struck. She's a young lady of qualities.

539
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:09,598
And I'm fed up with both
the young lady and her qualities.

540
00:41:09,682 --> 00:41:13,102
Studying me as if I were a play or a blueprint.

541
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:16,188
How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep.

542
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:20,150
How can you take offence at a kid
trying to be like her ideal?

543
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:22,735
Stop calling her a kid.

544
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:28,074
As it happens, there are
particular aspects of my life

545
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:32,369
to which I would like to maintain
sole and exclusive rights and privileges.

546
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:35,706
- For instance, what?
- For instance, you.

547
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:41,878
This is my cue to take you
in my arms and reassure you.

548
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:43,838
But I'm not going to. I'm too mad.

549
00:41:43,922 --> 00:41:45,465
- Guilty!
- Mad!

550
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:49,760
There are certain characteristics
for which you are famous, on stage and off.

551
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:54,306
I love you for some and in spite of others.
I haven't let those become too important.

552
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:59,060
They're part of your equipment for getting
along in what is called "our environment".

553
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:01,730
You have to keep your teeth sharp, all right.

554
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:04,774
But I will not have you
sharpen them on me, or on Eve.

555
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:09,403
- What about her teeth? Her fangs?
- She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!

556
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:12,615
So when you start judging
an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid

557
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:17,911
by the bar-room, Benzedrine standards of
this megalomaniac society, I won't have it!

558
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:21,581
Eve Harrington has never by word,
look, thought or suggestion

559
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:26,252
indicated anything to me but adoration
for you and happiness at our being in love.

560
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:31,257
To intimate anything else spells a paranoiac
insecurity thatyou should be ashamed of.

561
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,345
Cut. Print it. What happens in the next reel?
Do I get dragged off to the snake pits?

562
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,513
Miss Channing?

563
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,852
The hors d'oeuvres are here.
Is there anything else I can do?

564
00:42:48,564 --> 00:42:52,318
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.

565
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:54,486
I'll get it.

566
00:42:56,822 --> 00:42:59,032
- What'll you have?
- A milk shake?

567
00:43:00,158 --> 00:43:02,660
A martini, very dry, please.

568
00:43:06,956 --> 00:43:09,959
- The party's on the first floor.
- Hi, Bill.

569
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:12,419
- Hello, Mrs Richards.
- How are you, dear?

570
00:43:12,503 --> 00:43:15,339
Good evening, Mr Richards. Mr Fabian.

571
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:17,758
- May I have your coat?
- I'll take it up.

572
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:19,926
- Please.
- Thank you.

573
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:22,554
- Hi.
- Hi, Margo.

574
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:26,182
- The house looks lovely.
- I like that girl.

575
00:43:26,265 --> 00:43:28,392
That quality of quiet graciousness.

576
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:31,312
Among so many quiet qualities.

577
00:43:31,395 --> 00:43:33,314
Shall we?

578
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:38,610
- It's made me so happy your taking Eve in.
- I'm so happy you're happy.

579
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:43,823
You haven't been running a settlement house
exactly. The kid has earned her way.

580
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:46,617
You had a mixed-up inventory
when she took over.

581
00:43:46,701 --> 00:43:48,995
Merchandise laying all over the shop.

582
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:52,998
- You mixed Margo up with a five-and-ten.
- Make it Bergdorf Goodman.

583
00:43:53,082 --> 00:43:56,960
Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max?
All done up in little ribbons.

584
00:43:57,044 --> 00:44:00,005
I could die right now
and nobody'd be confused.

585
00:44:00,088 --> 00:44:02,382
- How aboutyou, Max?
- How about me what?

586
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:05,593
Suppose you dropped dead.
What aboutyour inventory?

587
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:09,930
I ain't going to drop dead. Not with the heat.

588
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,808
This is the most ghoulish conversation.

589
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:15,018
- Thank you.
- Nothing.

590
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:17,104
Max!

591
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,606
Fife!

592
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:24,152
"The kid" will be down in a minute, unless
you'd like to take her drink up to her.

593
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:28,030
I can get a fresh one...
Karen, you're a Gibson girl.

594
00:44:28,322 --> 00:44:30,950
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish.

595
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:34,161
- What has or is about to happen?
- What is he talking about?

596
00:44:34,244 --> 00:44:37,706
- Macbeth.
- We've seen you like this before.

597
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:40,292
Is it over or is it just beginning?

598
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:54,096
Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a bumpy night.

599
00:44:55,931 --> 00:44:58,308
- Margo, darling!
- How are you?

600
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:04,522
Enchantée to you too.

601
00:45:05,023 --> 00:45:08,985
I remember, Addison, crossing you off
my guest list. What are you doing here?

602
00:45:09,068 --> 00:45:13,405
Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable
Peter Pan. You must play it again soon.

603
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:16,033
- Remember Miss Caswell?
- I do not. How do you do?

604
00:45:16,116 --> 00:45:19,286
- We've never met. Maybe that's why.
- She is an actress.

605
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:22,705
A graduate of the Copacabana
School of Dramatic Art.

606
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:26,125
Eve.

607
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:29,587
- Good evening, Mr DeWitt.
- I had no idea you knew each other.

608
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,464
This must be, at long last,
our formal introduction.

609
00:45:32,548 --> 00:45:37,386
- Until now, we've only met in passing.
- That's how you met me. In passing.

610
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:39,930
Eve, this is an old friend
of Mr DeWitt's mother.

611
00:45:40,013 --> 00:45:43,474
- Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington.
- How do you do?

612
00:45:43,558 --> 00:45:46,436
I've been wanting you
to meet Eve for the longest time.

613
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:49,605
Your timidity must have
kept you from mentioning it.

614
00:45:49,689 --> 00:45:53,108
- You know of her interest in the theatre?
- We have that in common.

615
00:45:53,192 --> 00:45:55,110
Then you two must have a long talk.

616
00:45:55,194 --> 00:45:58,238
I'm afraid Mr DeWitt would find me
boring before too long.

617
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:01,825
You won't bore him, honey.
You won't even get a chance to talk.

618
00:46:01,908 --> 00:46:03,993
Claudia, come here.

619
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:08,956
You see that man?
That's Max Fabian, the producer.

620
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,375
Now, go and do yourself some good.

621
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:14,211
Why do they always look
like unhappy rabbits?

622
00:46:14,294 --> 00:46:18,048
Cos that's what they are.
Now go and make him happier.

623
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:25,138
Now, don't worry aboutyour little charge.
She'll be in safe hands.

624
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:38,024
Amen!

625
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:24,192
- Liebestraum.
- I just played it.

626
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:27,570
- Play it again.
- But that was the fourth straight time.

627
00:47:27,653 --> 00:47:29,905
Then this will be five.

628
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:37,287
Many of your guests are wondering when
they may be permitted to viewthe body.

629
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:41,624
- Where has it been laid out?
- It hasn't been laid out.

630
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:44,961
We haven't finished with the embalming.

631
00:47:45,044 --> 00:47:48,047
As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.

632
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,966
The remains of Margo Channing...

633
00:47:51,884 --> 00:47:53,969
sitting up.

634
00:47:54,053 --> 00:47:57,556
It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.

635
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:00,141
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?

636
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:04,604
You know nothing about feelings,
natural or unnatural.

637
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:08,316
Your guests were also wondering
whether the music couldn't be

638
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:11,735
a shade more on the...
shall we say, happier side?

639
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:17,449
If my guests do not like it here,
I suggest they accompany you to the nursery

640
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:21,369
where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.

641
00:48:21,453 --> 00:48:26,416
Margo, you by any chance haven't got
any bicarbonate of soda in the house?

642
00:48:26,499 --> 00:48:29,835
Poor Max. Heartburn?

643
00:48:31,045 --> 00:48:33,339
It's that Miss Caswell.

644
00:48:33,422 --> 00:48:36,592
I don't see why she hasn't
given Addison heartburn.

645
00:48:36,675 --> 00:48:42,347
- No heart to burn.
- Everybody has a heart, except some people.

646
00:48:43,431 --> 00:48:45,683
Of course I've got bicarb.

647
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:48,269
I've got a box in the pantry.

648
00:48:48,352 --> 00:48:51,939
We'll putyour name on it. "Max Fabian."

649
00:48:52,022 --> 00:48:56,443
It will stay there always, just for you.

650
00:48:57,527 --> 00:49:00,947
Let the rest of the world
beat their brains out for a buck.

651
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,158
It's friends that count.

652
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:08,079
- And I have friends.
- I love you, Max. I really mean it.

653
00:49:08,162 --> 00:49:10,414
I love you.

654
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:12,791
Come to the pantry.

655
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:16,587
She loves me like a father. Also, she's loaded.

656
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:34,269
There you are, Maxie dear.

657
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:37,481
One good burp
and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell.

658
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:41,151
The situation I'm in ain't the kind
you can belch your way out of.

659
00:49:41,234 --> 00:49:44,654
- I made a promise.
- To Miss Caswell? What?

660
00:49:44,737 --> 00:49:47,448
For an audition for this part we are replacing.

661
00:49:47,532 --> 00:49:49,575
What's her name? Your sister?

662
00:49:49,658 --> 00:49:52,036
- One?
- No, two, please.

663
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:54,455
If she can act, she might not be bad.

664
00:49:54,538 --> 00:49:57,666
She looks like she might
burn down a plantation.

665
00:49:57,749 --> 00:50:00,585
Right now, I feel like
there is one burning in me.

666
00:50:00,669 --> 00:50:03,630
- When's the audition?
- A couple of weeks.

667
00:50:03,713 --> 00:50:07,425
Tell you what. Why don't I read with her?

668
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:11,262
- Would you?
- Anything to help you out, Max.

669
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:14,389
Now that's cooperation. I appreciate it.

670
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:18,268
Not at all. And now you
can do me a great favour.

671
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:20,478
Just name it.

672
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:23,898
Give Eve Harrington a job in your office.

673
00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:30,154
You get quick action, don'tyou?

674
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:33,157
I wouldn't think of taking
that girl away from you.

675
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,994
You said yourself my inventory was in shape,
all my merchandise put away.

676
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:41,664
To keep her here with nothing to do,
I'd be standing in her way.

677
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:44,667
- And you need her, Max.
- What will she do?

678
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,587
She'd be a great help. She'd read scripts,

679
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:52,174
interview people you have to see,
get rid of those you don't have to.

680
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,843
You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie.

681
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,304
- Well...
- Think of your health.

682
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,932
More time to relax
in the fresh air at a racetrack.

683
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,602
- I don't think it's such a good idea.
- Promise?

684
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,771
- Promise.
- That's my Max.

685
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:10,274
There you both are.

686
00:51:10,357 --> 00:51:12,568
Max, Karen's decided it's time to go.

687
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:15,279
- Where is she now?
- Up in your room.

688
00:51:15,362 --> 00:51:18,698
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go and tell Miss Caswell.

689
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:25,038
- Who's left out there?
- Too many.

690
00:51:25,121 --> 00:51:28,624
And, besides, you got a new guest.
A movie star from Hollywood.

691
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:33,420
Shucks! And I sent
my autograph bookto the cleaners.

692
00:51:37,424 --> 00:51:40,302
You disapprove of me
when I'm like this, don'tyou?

693
00:51:40,385 --> 00:51:45,056
Not exactly. Sometimes, though,
I wish I understood you better.

694
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:47,642
- When you do, let me in on it.
- I will.

695
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:53,981
- How's the new one coming?
- The play? Oh, all right, I guess.

696
00:51:54,982 --> 00:51:58,401
Cora. Still a girl of 20?

697
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:00,570
20-ish. It's not important.

698
00:52:00,654 --> 00:52:03,448
Don't you think it's about time
it became important?

699
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:06,701
- How do you mean?
- Don't be evasive.

700
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:09,245
Margo, you haven't got any age.

701
00:52:09,328 --> 00:52:12,998
Miss Channing is ageless.
Spoken like a press agent.

702
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:15,918
I know what I'm talking about.
They're my plays.

703
00:52:16,001 --> 00:52:18,086
Spoken like an author.

704
00:52:19,004 --> 00:52:22,298
Lloyd, I'm not 20-ish. I'm not 30-ish.

705
00:52:22,382 --> 00:52:25,218
Three months ago I was 40 years old.

706
00:52:25,301 --> 00:52:27,887
40! Four-0.

707
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:35,561
That slipped out.
I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it.

708
00:52:37,312 --> 00:52:41,232
Now I suddenly feel as if
I've taken all my clothes off.

709
00:52:44,277 --> 00:52:47,238
To thousands of people
you're as young as you want.

710
00:52:47,321 --> 00:52:50,074
As young as they want, you mean.

711
00:52:50,157 --> 00:52:54,036
I'm not interested whether thousands
of people think I'm six or 600.

712
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,622
Just one person, isn't that so?

713
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:04,420
You know what this is all about. It has little
to do with whether you should play Cora.

714
00:53:04,504 --> 00:53:07,632
It has everything to do with
you having a fight with Bill.

715
00:53:07,715 --> 00:53:10,801
Bill's 32. He looks 32.

716
00:53:10,885 --> 00:53:15,389
He looked it five years ago.
He'll look it 20 years from now.

717
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:17,557
I hate men.

718
00:53:20,226 --> 00:53:23,062
Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your play.

719
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:27,441
I'll wear rompers and come in
rolling a hoop, if you like.

720
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,073
Who'd show up at this hour?
It's time people went home.

721
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:39,452
Hold that coat up.

722
00:53:42,455 --> 00:53:45,792
- Whose is it?
- Some Hollywood movie star.

723
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:49,253
- Her plane got in late.
- Discouraging, isn't it?

724
00:53:49,337 --> 00:53:52,715
Women with furs like that
where it never even gets cold.

725
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:54,883
Hollywood.

726
00:53:57,386 --> 00:54:00,972
Tell me, Eve. How are things
going with you? Happy?

727
00:54:01,056 --> 00:54:03,308
There should be a new word for happiness.

728
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:07,145
Being here with Miss Channing
has been a... I just can't say.

729
00:54:07,228 --> 00:54:10,689
She's been so wonderful,
done so much for me.

730
00:54:12,107 --> 00:54:17,821
Lloyd says Margo compensates for
underplaying on stage by overplaying reality.

731
00:54:18,864 --> 00:54:22,867
Next to that sable, my new mink
seems like an old bed jacket.

732
00:54:22,951 --> 00:54:28,372
You've done your share, Eve. You've
worked wonders with Margo. Good night.

733
00:54:28,456 --> 00:54:31,292
- Mrs Richards?
- Karen.

734
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,335
Karen.

735
00:54:33,419 --> 00:54:37,047
Isn't it awful? I'm about
to ask you for another favour,

736
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,132
after all you've done already.

737
00:54:39,216 --> 00:54:41,134
Nobody's done so much.

738
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:44,887
Stop thinking of yourself
as one of the hundred neediest cases.

739
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:49,100
- What is it?
- Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape,

740
00:54:49,183 --> 00:54:52,311
so there isn't enough
to keep me as busy as I should be.

741
00:54:52,394 --> 00:54:55,731
Not that I'd consider anything
that would take me away from her.

742
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:59,401
But the other day
when Mr Fabian told Miss Channing

743
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:04,030
that her understudy was going to have
a baby and they'd have to replace her...

744
00:55:04,113 --> 00:55:08,868
- You wanna be Margo's new understudy?
- I don't let myself think about it even.

745
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:12,538
But I do knowthe part so well,
and every bit of the staging,

746
00:55:12,621 --> 00:55:15,541
there'd be no need to break in a new girl.

747
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:19,377
Suppose I had to go on one night

748
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:22,755
to an audience that came
to see Margo Channing.

749
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:26,384
- I couldn't possibly.
- I wouldn't worry too much about that.

750
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:32,097
Margo just doesn't miss performances.
If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays.

751
00:55:32,181 --> 00:55:36,685
- The show must go on.
- No, dear. Margo must go on.

752
00:55:36,768 --> 00:55:39,938
I don't see any reason
why you shouldn't be her understudy.

753
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:43,608
- You think Miss Channing would approve?
- I think she'd cheer.

754
00:55:43,691 --> 00:55:48,029
- But Mr Richards and Mr Sampson?
- They'll do as they're told.

755
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:52,157
Then... would you speak
to Mr Fabian about it?

756
00:55:52,241 --> 00:55:55,035
- Of course.
- You won't forget?

757
00:55:55,327 --> 00:55:57,412
I won't forget.

758
00:55:59,748 --> 00:56:03,626
I seem to be forever
thanking you for something, don't I?

759
00:56:11,592 --> 00:56:14,553
The bed looks like a dead animal act.

760
00:56:14,636 --> 00:56:18,098
- Which one is sable?
- But she just got here.

761
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:21,768
Well, she's on her way
with half the men in the joint.

762
00:56:21,851 --> 00:56:25,480
- It's only a fur coat.
- What do you expect? Live sable?

763
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:29,734
Diamond collar, gold sleeves.
You know - picture people.

764
00:56:31,193 --> 00:56:34,571
Elder statesmen of the theatre or cinema

765
00:56:34,655 --> 00:56:39,159
assure the public that actors
and actresses are just plain folks,

766
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:42,829
ignoring the fact that their greatest
attraction to the public

767
00:56:42,912 --> 00:56:46,582
is their complete lack of resemblance
to normal human beings.

768
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:50,086
Now there's something
a girl could make sacrifices for.

769
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:52,671
- And probably has.
- Sable.

770
00:56:52,755 --> 00:56:56,258
- Sable? Did she say sable or Gable?
- Either one.

771
00:56:56,341 --> 00:56:59,511
We all have abnormality in common.

772
00:56:59,594 --> 00:57:03,431
We're a breed apart from the rest
of humanity, we theatre folk.

773
00:57:03,515 --> 00:57:06,767
We are the original displaced personalities.

774
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:10,688
You won't have to read his column
tomorrow, Eve. You just heard it.

775
00:57:10,771 --> 00:57:15,108
- I don't agree, Addison.
- That's your particular abnormality.

776
00:57:15,192 --> 00:57:17,944
I admit there's a screwball
element in the theatre.

777
00:57:18,028 --> 00:57:22,073
It sticks out, it's got spotlights
on it and a brass band.

778
00:57:22,157 --> 00:57:27,328
But it isn't basic. It isn't standard.
If it were, the theatre couldn't survive.

779
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:31,832
- Waiter.
- That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.

780
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:34,334
Well, I can'tyell out "butler", can I?

781
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:37,004
Maybe somebody's name is Butler.

782
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:40,715
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.

783
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,761
I don't wanna make trouble.
All I want is a drink.

784
00:57:44,844 --> 00:57:48,639
- Leave it to me. I'll getyou one.
- Thank you, Mr Fabian.

785
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:54,144
Well done. I can see your career
rising in the east like the sun.

786
00:57:56,355 --> 00:58:00,734
- You were saying?
- The theatre is nine-tenths hard work.

787
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:05,571
Work done the hard way - by sweat,
application and craftsmanship.

788
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:09,367
To be a good actor or actress,
or anything in the theatre,

789
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:12,286
means wanting to be that
more than anything else.

790
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:14,621
Yes. Yes, it does.

791
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:18,500
It means a concentration
of desire or ambition and sacrifice

792
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,877
such as no other profession demands.

793
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,839
And the man or woman who accepts
those terms can't be ordinary,

794
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:27,091
can't be just someone.

795
00:58:27,175 --> 00:58:30,136
To give so much for almost always so little.

796
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:32,513
"So little"?

797
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:34,765
"So little", did you say?

798
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:39,394
Why, if there's nothing else,
there's applause.

799
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:42,772
I've listened backstage to people applaud.

800
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,774
It's like...

801
00:58:44,857 --> 00:58:49,737
Like waves of love coming over
the footlights and wrapping you up.

802
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:55,242
Imagine - to know every night
that different hundreds of people love you.

803
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:59,538
They smile, their eyes shine,
you've pleased them.

804
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:02,749
They wantyou. You belong.

805
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,253
Just that alone is worth anything.

806
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:25,770
Don't get up. And please stop acting
as if I were the Queen Mother.

807
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,814
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Outside of a beehive, Margo,

808
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,067
your behaviour is hardly queenly or motherly.

809
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,236
You're in a beehive, pal.

810
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:38,949
We're all busy little bees, full of stings,
making honey day and night.

811
00:59:39,032 --> 00:59:41,159
- Aren't we, honey?
- Margo, really.

812
00:59:41,493 --> 00:59:44,120
Please don't play governess, Karen.

813
00:59:44,203 --> 00:59:47,707
I haven'tyour unyielding good taste.

814
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:52,461
I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too,
but Father wouldn't hear of it.

815
00:59:52,544 --> 00:59:55,297
He needed help behind a notions counter.

816
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,509
I'm being rude now, aren't I?
Or should I say, ain't I?

817
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:03,555
You're maudlin and full of self-pity.
You're magnificent.

818
01:00:03,638 --> 01:00:06,099
How about calling it a night?

819
01:00:06,182 --> 01:00:08,768
And you pose as a playwright.

820
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:13,480
A situation pregnant with possibilities,
and all you can think of is "go to sleep".

821
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:16,900
- It's a good thought.
- It won't play.

822
01:00:17,651 --> 01:00:21,905
As a nonprofessional,
I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me.

823
01:00:22,697 --> 01:00:25,783
Undramatic, perhaps, but practical.

824
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:28,703
- Happy little housewife.
- Cut it out.

825
01:00:28,786 --> 01:00:33,707
This is my house, not a theatre.
In my house you're a guest, not a director.

826
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:37,627
Then stop being a star and treating
your guests as your supporting cast.

827
01:00:37,711 --> 01:00:40,380
- Let's not get into a big hassle.
- It's time we did.

828
01:00:40,463 --> 01:00:44,634
Margo has to realise what's attractive
on stage need not be attractive off.

829
01:00:44,717 --> 01:00:47,220
All right!

830
01:00:47,303 --> 01:00:49,430
I'm going to bed.

831
01:00:56,603 --> 01:01:01,191
You be host. It's your party.
Happy birthday. Welcome home.

832
01:01:01,274 --> 01:01:03,902
And we who are about to die salute you.

833
01:01:03,985 --> 01:01:06,070
Need any help?

834
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:15,495
To put me to bed?
Take my clothes off, hold my head?

835
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:19,958
Tuck me in, turn out the lights
and tiptoe out?

836
01:01:21,668 --> 01:01:24,087
Eve would, wouldn'tyou, Eve?

837
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,798
- If you'd like.
- I wouldn't like.

838
01:01:34,388 --> 01:01:36,890
- I forgot I had it.
- I didn't.

839
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:47,733
Too bad. We're gonna miss the third act.

840
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:50,319
They're gonna play it offstage.

841
01:01:53,322 --> 01:01:55,824
- Coming, Max?
- In a minute.

842
01:01:58,952 --> 01:02:03,289
Eve, you mustn't mind Margo
too much, even if I do.

843
01:02:03,373 --> 01:02:06,751
There must be some reason,
something I've done without knowing.

844
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:10,754
The reason is Margo and don't try
to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.

845
01:02:10,838 --> 01:02:13,382
But if I thought I'd offended her,
of all people...

846
01:02:13,465 --> 01:02:19,137
Eve... I'm fond of Margo, too.
But I know Margo. And every now and then,

847
01:02:19,221 --> 01:02:24,350
there is nothing I wanna do so much
as kick her right square in the pants.

848
01:02:24,434 --> 01:02:27,019
Well, if she has to pick on someone,

849
01:02:27,103 --> 01:02:29,605
I'd just as soon it was me.

850
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,860
- Max is gonna drop us.
- Good night.

851
01:02:34,943 --> 01:02:37,112
- Good night.
- Good night.

852
01:02:37,195 --> 01:02:42,033
Mrs Richards? You won't forget, will you?
What we talked about before?

853
01:02:42,117 --> 01:02:44,202
No, Eve. I won't forget.

854
01:03:10,726 --> 01:03:12,686
Why so remote, Addison?

855
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:16,356
You should be at the side of
your protégée, lending her moral support.

856
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,527
Miss Caswell is where I can
lend no support, moral or otherwise.

857
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,821
In the ladies' shall we say "lounge"?

858
01:03:22,904 --> 01:03:25,239
Being violently ill to her tummy.

859
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:27,783
It's good luck before an audition.

860
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:30,995
Miss Caswell got lucky too late.
The audition is over.

861
01:03:31,078 --> 01:03:34,832
It can't be. I came here to read
with Miss Caswell. I promised Max.

862
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:37,459
The audition was at 2.30.
It's now nearly four.

863
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:41,254
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch.
I never have, you know.

864
01:03:41,337 --> 01:03:43,673
Who read with Miss Caswell?

865
01:03:43,756 --> 01:03:46,384
- Bill? Lloyd?
- No.

866
01:03:46,467 --> 01:03:50,262
- Well, it can't have been Max. Who?
- Naturally, your understudy.

867
01:03:50,346 --> 01:03:53,932
It's unnatural to allow a girl
in an advanced state of pregnancy...

868
01:03:54,016 --> 01:03:58,979
I refer to your new and unpregnant
understudy, Miss Eve Harrington.

869
01:03:59,062 --> 01:04:01,731
Eve? My understudy?

870
01:04:01,815 --> 01:04:05,568
- Didn'tyou know?
- Of course I knew.

871
01:04:05,651 --> 01:04:07,737
It just slipped your mind?

872
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,118
How... was Miss Caswell?

873
01:04:14,743 --> 01:04:16,953
Frankly, I don't remember.

874
01:04:17,037 --> 01:04:19,664
- Just slipped your mind?
- Completely.

875
01:04:19,748 --> 01:04:23,084
Nor can anyone else present
tell you how Miss Caswell read,

876
01:04:23,168 --> 01:04:26,170
or whether Miss Caswell read
or rode a pogo stick.

877
01:04:26,254 --> 01:04:28,464
Was she that bad?

878
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:33,177
Margo, I have lived in the theatre
as a Trappist monk lives in his faith.

879
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,971
I have no other world, no other life.

880
01:04:36,054 --> 01:04:39,140
Once in a great while,
I experience that moment of revelation

881
01:04:39,224 --> 01:04:42,310
for which all true believers
wait and pray. You were one.

882
01:04:42,393 --> 01:04:48,274
Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely,
Hayes. There are others, three or four.

883
01:04:48,357 --> 01:04:50,651
Eve Harrington will be among them.

884
01:04:50,734 --> 01:04:52,861
I take it she read well.

885
01:04:52,945 --> 01:04:55,322
It wasn't a reading, it was a performance.

886
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:59,034
Brilliant, vivid,
something made of music and fire.

887
01:04:59,117 --> 01:05:01,244
How nice.

888
01:05:01,327 --> 01:05:04,205
In time, she'll be whatyou are.

889
01:05:04,289 --> 01:05:06,791
A mass of music and fire.

890
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,045
That's me. An old kazoo with some sparklers.

891
01:05:13,505 --> 01:05:17,134
Tell me, was... Bill swept away too?

892
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:21,554
- Or were you too full of revelation to notice?
- Bill didn't say.

893
01:05:21,638 --> 01:05:26,601
But Lloyd listened to his play as if
it had been written by someone else, he said.

894
01:05:26,684 --> 01:05:29,979
It sounded so fresh,
so new, so full of meaning.

895
01:05:30,604 --> 01:05:34,942
How nice for Lloyd. How nice for Eve.
How nice for everybody.

896
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:39,738
Eve was incredibly modest.
She insisted that no credit was due her.

897
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:44,075
That Lloyd felt as he did because she read
his lines exactly as he'd written them.

898
01:05:44,158 --> 01:05:47,370
The implication being
that I did not read them as written?

899
01:05:47,453 --> 01:05:51,957
Neither your name nor your performance
entered the conversation.

900
01:05:58,505 --> 01:06:00,590
Feeling better, my dear?

901
01:06:02,675 --> 01:06:07,054
Like I just swam the English Channel.
Now what?

902
01:06:07,138 --> 01:06:11,308
Your next move, it seems to me,
should be towards television.

903
01:06:14,853 --> 01:06:18,648
Tell me this.
Do they have auditions for television?

904
01:06:18,732 --> 01:06:22,735
That's all television is, my dear.
Nothing but auditions.

905
01:06:27,532 --> 01:06:29,617
Margo, darling.

906
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,922
Terribly sorry I was late.
Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab.

907
01:06:45,006 --> 01:06:48,384
- Where's Miss Caswell? Oh, hello, Eve.
- Hello, Miss Channing.

908
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:51,095
How are you making out
in Mr Fabian's office?

909
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:55,766
Now, Max, I don't wantyou working this child
too hard just because you promised.

910
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:58,977
As you see, I kept my promise, too.

911
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:01,354
It's all over.

912
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:04,524
- What's all over?
- The audition.

913
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:09,320
- Eve read with Miss Caswell.
- Eve? How enchanting.

914
01:07:09,403 --> 01:07:12,823
How did you get the idea of letting
Eve read with Miss Caswell?

915
01:07:12,906 --> 01:07:17,119
- Well, she's your understudy.
- Eve? My understudy? I had no idea.

916
01:07:17,202 --> 01:07:19,454
I thoughtyou knew. She started a week ago.

917
01:07:19,538 --> 01:07:25,793
I've never seen her backstage, but with
so many people loitering about... Well, well.

918
01:07:25,877 --> 01:07:28,587
So Eve is not working for Max, after all.

919
01:07:29,714 --> 01:07:32,216
Max, you sly puss.

920
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:39,347
Miss Channing, I can't tell you
how glad I am thatyou arrived so late.

921
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:43,601
- Really, Eve? Why?
- Otherwise, I never would have dared to read.

922
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:46,229
- Why not?
- If you'd come in the middle,

923
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,397
I couldn't have gone on.

924
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:52,484
What a pity.
All that fire and music being turned off.

925
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,112
- What fire and music?
- You wouldn't understand.

926
01:07:55,195 --> 01:07:57,280
How was Miss Caswell?

927
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:59,491
Back to the Copacabana.

928
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:02,285
But Eve, Margo. Let me tell you about Eve.

929
01:08:02,368 --> 01:08:07,957
I was dreadful, Miss Channing. I have no right
to be anyone's understudy, much less yours.

930
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,751
I'm sure you underestimate yourself.
You always do.

931
01:08:10,835 --> 01:08:12,836
You were about to tell me about Eve.

932
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,005
- You'd have been proud of her.
- I'm sure.

933
01:08:15,088 --> 01:08:17,758
- She was a revelation.
- To you too?

934
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:21,219
- What do you mean by that?
- It must have been a revelation

935
01:08:21,302 --> 01:08:25,181
to have a 24-year-old character
played by a 24-year-old actress.

936
01:08:25,264 --> 01:08:27,725
- That's beside the point.
- It is the point.

937
01:08:27,808 --> 01:08:30,144
It must have seemed so new and fresh to you,

938
01:08:30,227 --> 01:08:33,522
so exciting, to have your lines
read just as you wrote them.

939
01:08:33,605 --> 01:08:36,858
- Addison.
- So full of meaning, fire and music.

940
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:41,154
You've talked to that
venomous fishwife DeWitt.

941
01:08:41,237 --> 01:08:44,073
In this case, as trustworthy
as the world almanac.

942
01:08:44,157 --> 01:08:47,243
You knew when you came in
that Eve was your understudy.

943
01:08:47,326 --> 01:08:49,829
Playing that childish game of cat and mouse.

944
01:08:49,912 --> 01:08:53,123
Not mouse. Never mouse. If anything, rat.

945
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:58,044
Your genius for making a bar-room brawl
out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding.

946
01:08:58,128 --> 01:09:00,880
Perfectly innocent?
Men have been hanged for less.

947
01:09:00,964 --> 01:09:03,383
I'm lied to, attacked behind my back,

948
01:09:03,466 --> 01:09:06,677
accused of reading your play
as if it were the holy gospel.

949
01:09:06,761 --> 01:09:08,554
I never said it was.

950
01:09:08,638 --> 01:09:12,975
You listen as if someone else had written
your play. Whom do you have in mind?

951
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,353
Arthur Miller? Sherwood?
Beaumont and Fletcher?

952
01:09:16,436 --> 01:09:18,939
- May I say a word?
- No!

953
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:24,068
You think Miller or Sherwood would stand
for the nonsense I take from you?

954
01:09:24,152 --> 01:09:28,447
Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher.
They've been dead for 300 years!

955
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,326
All playwrights should be dead for 300 years!

956
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,748
That would solve none of their problems
because actresses never die!

957
01:09:41,918 --> 01:09:45,463
The stars never die and never change.

958
01:09:45,797 --> 01:09:48,299
You may change this star any time you want

959
01:09:48,382 --> 01:09:52,636
for a new and fresh and exciting one,
fully equipped with fire and music.

960
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,848
Any time you want,
starting with tonight's performance.

961
01:09:56,932 --> 01:09:59,017
This is for lawyers to talk about.

962
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,896
This concerns a contract
that you cannot rewrite or ad-lib.

963
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:07,358
Are you threatening me
with legal action, Mr Fabian?

964
01:10:07,858 --> 01:10:11,946
- Are you breaking the contract?
- Answer my question.

965
01:10:12,029 --> 01:10:16,158
- Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
- I don't hear you.

966
01:10:16,241 --> 01:10:20,161
- I said I'm a dying man!
- Not until the last drugstore

967
01:10:20,245 --> 01:10:22,956
has sold its last pill.

968
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,792
I shall never understand the process
by which a body with a voice

969
01:10:26,876 --> 01:10:29,336
suddenly fancies itself as a mind.

970
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,922
Just when does an actress decide

971
01:10:32,006 --> 01:10:35,592
they're her words she's saying
and her thoughts she's expressing?

972
01:10:35,676 --> 01:10:39,304
Usually at the point
when she has to rewrite and rethinkthem

973
01:10:39,387 --> 01:10:42,056
to keep the audience from leaving the theatre.

974
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:47,019
It's about time the piano realised
it has not written the concerto!

975
01:10:52,066 --> 01:10:58,864
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski
who plays his concerto on me, the piano?

976
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:03,243
Where is Princess Fire and Music?

977
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:05,828
- Who?
- The kid. Junior.

978
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:14,461
- Gone.
- I must have frightened her away.

979
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:17,464
I wouldn't be surprised.
Sometimes you frighten me.

980
01:11:17,547 --> 01:11:20,967
Poor little flower.
Dropped her petals and folded her tent.

981
01:11:21,051 --> 01:11:24,387
- Don't mix your metaphors.
- I'll mix what I like!

982
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:27,640
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.

983
01:11:27,723 --> 01:11:30,184
What a body. What a voice.

984
01:11:30,935 --> 01:11:34,980
That ex ship-news reporter.
No body, no voice, all mind.

985
01:11:35,147 --> 01:11:39,651
- The gong rang, the fight's over, calm down.
- I will not calm down.

986
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:42,237
Don't calm down.

987
01:11:44,906 --> 01:11:49,326
- You're being terribly tolerant, aren'tyou?
- I'm trying terribly hard.

988
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:53,914
Well, you needn't be. I will not be
tolerated and I will not be plotted against.

989
01:11:53,997 --> 01:11:57,250
- Here we go.
- Such nonsense. What do you take me for?

990
01:11:57,334 --> 01:12:01,880
Little Nell from the country? Been my
understudy for a week without me knowing it.

991
01:12:01,963 --> 01:12:05,049
- Carefully hidden, no doubt.
- Don't get carried away.

992
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:08,678
Arrives here for an audition
when everyone knows I will be here,

993
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:13,599
- and gives a performance out of nowhere.
- You've been all through that with Lloyd.

994
01:12:13,682 --> 01:12:17,811
The playwright doesn't make the
performance. It doesn't just happen.

995
01:12:17,894 --> 01:12:20,814
Full of fire and music and whatnot.

996
01:12:20,897 --> 01:12:23,316
Carefully rehearsed, I have no doubt.

997
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:26,152
Full of those Bill Sampson touches.

998
01:12:26,235 --> 01:12:29,739
- I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts.
- Paranoiac?

999
01:12:29,822 --> 01:12:32,950
I didn't know Eve was
your understudy until this afternoon.

1000
01:12:33,033 --> 01:12:38,830
- Tell that to Dr Freud along with the rest of it.
- No, I'll tell it to you for the last time.

1001
01:12:38,914 --> 01:12:43,418
Cos you've got to stop hurting the two of us
by these paranoiac tantrums.

1002
01:12:43,501 --> 01:12:47,171
- That word. I don't even know what it means.
- It's time you found out.

1003
01:12:47,255 --> 01:12:49,882
I love you. I love you.

1004
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:53,010
- You're beautiful and intelligent.
- A body with a voice.

1005
01:12:53,093 --> 01:12:56,888
A beautiful and an intelligent woman,
and a great actress.

1006
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:02,102
A great actress at the peak of her career.
You have every reason for happiness.

1007
01:13:02,185 --> 01:13:04,103
- Except happiness.
- Every reason.

1008
01:13:04,187 --> 01:13:08,899
But due to some uncontrollable drive,
you permit the slightest action of a kid...

1009
01:13:08,983 --> 01:13:12,903
- A kid!
- ..a kid to turn you into a screaming harpy.

1010
01:13:12,986 --> 01:13:15,322
Now, once and for all, stop it.

1011
01:13:33,213 --> 01:13:35,716
It's obvious you're not a woman.

1012
01:13:36,633 --> 01:13:40,762
- I've been aware of that for some time.
- Well, I am.

1013
01:13:40,845 --> 01:13:42,931
I'll say.

1014
01:13:43,431 --> 01:13:45,516
Don't be condescending.

1015
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,102
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.

1016
01:13:48,185 --> 01:13:53,399
I may have seen better days, but I'm
still not to be had for the price of a cocktail.

1017
01:13:53,482 --> 01:13:55,567
Like a salted peanut.

1018
01:13:56,693 --> 01:14:01,406
- Margo, let's make peace.
- The terms are too high.

1019
01:14:01,489 --> 01:14:05,952
Just being happy? Just stopping
all this nonsense about Eve?

1020
01:14:06,035 --> 01:14:08,704
- And Eve and me?
- It's not nonsense.

1021
01:14:08,788 --> 01:14:13,042
But if I tell you it is, as I just did...
were you listening to me?

1022
01:14:14,585 --> 01:14:18,463
- Isn't that enough?
- I wish it were.

1023
01:14:18,547 --> 01:14:21,132
Then what would be enough?

1024
01:14:21,216 --> 01:14:23,551
If we got married?

1025
01:14:23,635 --> 01:14:26,888
I wouldn't wantyou to marry me
just to prove something.

1026
01:14:26,971 --> 01:14:30,683
You've had so many reasons
for not wanting to marry me.

1027
01:14:31,892 --> 01:14:35,270
Margo, tell me what's behind all this.

1028
01:14:35,354 --> 01:14:37,355
I don't know, Bill.

1029
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,858
It's just a feeling. I don't know.

1030
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:41,943
I think you do know.

1031
01:14:42,026 --> 01:14:44,737
But you won't or can't tell me.

1032
01:14:46,155 --> 01:14:50,743
I said before it was gonna be
my last try, and I meant it.

1033
01:14:50,826 --> 01:14:54,371
I can't think of anything else to do.
I wish I could.

1034
01:14:55,706 --> 01:14:59,000
We usually wind up screaming
as the curtain comes down.

1035
01:14:59,084 --> 01:15:01,753
Then it comes up again and everything's fine.

1036
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:03,922
But not this time.

1037
01:15:05,923 --> 01:15:08,718
No playwright in the world
could make me believe

1038
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:12,137
this would happen between two adult people.

1039
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:15,599
Goodbye, Margo.

1040
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:23,940
Bill?

1041
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:28,069
Where are you going?

1042
01:15:28,152 --> 01:15:30,446
To find Eve?

1043
01:15:32,114 --> 01:15:35,659
That suddenly makes
the whole thing believable.

1044
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:00,056
Lloyd.

1045
01:16:01,016 --> 01:16:04,852
- Lloyd, what's happened?
- Up to here, that's where I've got it.

1046
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:07,730
Of all the star-ridden,
presumptuous, hysterical...

1047
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,690
- Margo again.
- And again and again.

1048
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,985
- Two hours late for the audition.
- That's on time for Margo.

1049
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,988
And then a childish routine about
not knowing Eve was her understudy.

1050
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,407
- It's possible she didn't.
- She knew.

1051
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:23,536
Addison told her how superbly
Eve had read the part.

1052
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:27,873
Karen, let me tell you about Eve.
She's got everything. A born actress.

1053
01:16:27,957 --> 01:16:32,586
- Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting...
- You'll run out of adjectives, dear.

1054
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:36,048
Everything a playwright first thinks
of wanting to write about,

1055
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:39,134
until his play becomes
a vehicle for Miss Channing.

1056
01:16:39,217 --> 01:16:41,219
Margo hasn't done badly by it.

1057
01:16:41,302 --> 01:16:44,180
Margo's great.
She knows it, that's the trouble.

1058
01:16:44,263 --> 01:16:47,516
She can play Peck's Bad Boy
all she wants and who's to stop her?

1059
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,770
Who's to give her that boot
in the rear she needs and deserves?

1060
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:55,983
It's gonna be a cosy weekend.

1061
01:16:56,066 --> 01:16:59,152
- What is?
- We're driving to the country tomorrow.

1062
01:16:59,236 --> 01:17:02,572
Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I.

1063
01:17:02,655 --> 01:17:06,492
Well, we've spent weekends
before with nobody talking.

1064
01:17:06,576 --> 01:17:11,205
Just be sure to lock up
all blunt instruments and throwable objects.

1065
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:19,337
Newton, they say, thought of gravity
by getting hit on the head by an apple.

1066
01:17:19,421 --> 01:17:23,925
And the man who invented the steam-engine,
he was watching a teakettle.

1067
01:17:24,008 --> 01:17:28,679
But not me. My big idea came
to me just sitting on a couch.

1068
01:17:29,764 --> 01:17:33,725
That boot in the rear to Margo.
Heaven knows, she had one coming.

1069
01:17:33,809 --> 01:17:38,105
From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,
Bill, Max and so on.

1070
01:17:38,188 --> 01:17:41,649
We'd allfelt those size fives
of hers often enough.

1071
01:17:41,733 --> 01:17:45,319
But how? The answer was
buzzing around me like a fly.

1072
01:17:46,237 --> 01:17:48,322
I had it.

1073
01:17:48,406 --> 01:17:52,618
But I let it go.
Screaming and calling names is one thing,

1074
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,786
but this could mean...

1075
01:17:56,621 --> 01:18:00,959
Why not? "Why"I said to myself"not?"

1076
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:06,214
It would all seem perfectly legitimate.
And only two people in the world would know.

1077
01:18:06,297 --> 01:18:10,384
Also, the boot would land where
it would do the most goodfor all concerned.

1078
01:18:10,468 --> 01:18:13,387
After all, it was no more than a harmless joke

1079
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:16,556
which Margo herself
would be the first to enjoy.

1080
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,810
And no reason why she shouldn't
be told about it... in time.

1081
01:18:28,818 --> 01:18:33,322
Hello. Will you please call
Miss Eve Harrington to the phone?

1082
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,825
Not at all. I'll wait.

1083
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:42,580
It was a cold weekend, outside and in.

1084
01:18:42,664 --> 01:18:44,540
Bill didn't come at all.

1085
01:18:44,624 --> 01:18:49,420
Margo didn't know where he was
and didn't care... she kept saying.

1086
01:18:49,503 --> 01:18:52,047
Somehow we staggered through Sunday,

1087
01:18:52,131 --> 01:18:55,968
and by the time we drove Margo
to the station late Monday afternoon,

1088
01:18:56,051 --> 01:19:01,139
she and Lloyd had thawed out
to the extent of being civil to each other.

1089
01:19:01,222 --> 01:19:05,393
- What time is it?
- When you asked a minute ago, it was 5.42.

1090
01:19:05,476 --> 01:19:08,646
It is now 5.43.
When you ask again a minute from now...

1091
01:19:08,729 --> 01:19:13,108
I just don't want Margo to miss her train.
As it is, she'll barely make the theatre.

1092
01:19:13,192 --> 01:19:16,987
5.55. We'll be at the station in plenty of time.

1093
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:20,782
That little place
" just two hours from New York".

1094
01:19:20,865 --> 01:19:26,245
It's on my list of things I'll never understand,
like collecting shrunken Indian heads.

1095
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:29,749
You should know what it means
to want a little peace and quiet.

1096
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:32,584
Peace and quiet is for libraries.

1097
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:34,837
Lloyd. Please.

1098
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:38,673
Just a little skid, that's all.
This road's like glass.

1099
01:19:38,757 --> 01:19:42,886
- Karen and I just don't want an accident.
- I don't intend to have an accident.

1100
01:19:42,969 --> 01:19:47,265
It isn't important whether you do.
We are wearing long underwear.

1101
01:19:49,433 --> 01:19:51,518
Now what's this?

1102
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,410
But it can't be. We can't be out of gas.

1103
01:20:09,493 --> 01:20:14,206
I filled it myself yesterday. Wasn't it full
when you drove to Brewster this morning?

1104
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:17,793
I didn't look. You know
I don't pay attention to those things.

1105
01:20:17,876 --> 01:20:19,419
Just incredible.

1106
01:20:19,502 --> 01:20:22,630
- How much time have we got?
- Roughly ten minutes.

1107
01:20:22,714 --> 01:20:25,675
- Howfar is the station?
- About three or four miles.

1108
01:20:25,758 --> 01:20:30,096
- Any houses where we can borrow gas?
- There's not much along this back road.

1109
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:33,474
Not many cars either.
Not much chance of a lift.

1110
01:20:33,557 --> 01:20:37,727
No sense in sitting here. I'm gonna
walk up about half a mile, just in case.

1111
01:20:55,702 --> 01:20:58,497
- You want it on?
- It doesn't matter.

1112
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:01,332
I detest cheap sentiment.

1113
01:21:07,672 --> 01:21:10,174
Karen?

1114
01:21:10,257 --> 01:21:11,425
No, thank you.

1115
01:21:11,508 --> 01:21:16,179
- I haven't been very pleasant this weekend.
- We've all been a little tense lately.

1116
01:21:16,263 --> 01:21:21,309
Come to think of it, I haven't been very
pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry.

1117
01:21:21,393 --> 01:21:25,354
More than any two people I know, I don't
want you and Lloyd to be angry with me.

1118
01:21:25,438 --> 01:21:29,442
We're never deeply angry.
We just get mad the way you do.

1119
01:21:29,525 --> 01:21:31,610
We know you too well.

1120
01:21:31,694 --> 01:21:34,279
So many people know me.

1121
01:21:34,363 --> 01:21:37,491
I wish I did.
I wish someone would tell me about me.

1122
01:21:37,783 --> 01:21:40,535
You're Margo. Just... Margo.

1123
01:21:41,161 --> 01:21:46,040
And what is that? Besides something
spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.

1124
01:21:46,124 --> 01:21:51,879
Besides a temperament, which consists
mostly of swooping about on a broomstick

1125
01:21:51,962 --> 01:21:54,298
and screaming at the top of my voice.

1126
01:21:54,381 --> 01:21:56,883
Infants behave the way I do, you know.

1127
01:21:56,967 --> 01:22:01,346
They carry on and misbehave.
They'd get drunk if they knew how,

1128
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:04,265
when they can't have what they want.

1129
01:22:04,349 --> 01:22:07,602
When they feel unwanted or insecure or...

1130
01:22:08,477 --> 01:22:10,396
unloved.

1131
01:22:11,981 --> 01:22:15,400
- What about Bill?
- What about Bill?

1132
01:22:15,484 --> 01:22:17,152
He's in love with you.

1133
01:22:17,235 --> 01:22:22,031
More than anything in this world,
I love Bill. And I want Bill.

1134
01:22:22,115 --> 01:22:24,200
And I want him to want me.

1135
01:22:24,284 --> 01:22:26,369
But me, not Margo Channing.

1136
01:22:27,411 --> 01:22:30,331
And if I can't tell them apart, how can he?

1137
01:22:31,081 --> 01:22:33,584
Well, why should he and why should you?

1138
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:38,588
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's
fought with her, worked with her, loved her.

1139
01:22:38,672 --> 01:22:42,967
But ten years from now
Margo Channing will have ceased to exist.

1140
01:22:43,051 --> 01:22:46,679
And what's left will be... what?

1141
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:51,058
Margo, Bill is all of
eight years younger than you.

1142
01:22:51,141 --> 01:22:56,188
Those years stretch as the years go on.
I've seen it happen too often.

1143
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:58,523
Not to you, not to Bill.

1144
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:01,401
Isn't that what they always say?

1145
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,116
I don't suppose the heater runs
if the motor doesn't.

1146
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:14,788
Silly, isn't it? You'd thinkthey'd fix it so
people could just sit in a car and keep warm.

1147
01:23:15,539 --> 01:23:17,916
About Eve.

1148
01:23:17,999 --> 01:23:21,378
I've acted pretty disgracefully
toward her too.

1149
01:23:22,378 --> 01:23:25,298
- Well...
- Don't fumble for excuses.

1150
01:23:25,381 --> 01:23:28,134
Not here and now with my hair down.

1151
01:23:29,218 --> 01:23:32,930
At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to...

1152
01:23:33,013 --> 01:23:37,976
Well, to the fact that she's so young,
so feminine and so helpless.

1153
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:41,271
To so many things I want to be for Bill.

1154
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:48,861
It's funny, a woman's career. The things you
drop on your way up so you can move faster.

1155
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:52,906
You forgetyou'll need them again
when you get backto being a woman.

1156
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:57,869
That's one career all females have
in common, whether we like it or not.

1157
01:23:57,953 --> 01:24:00,038
Being a woman.

1158
01:24:00,121 --> 01:24:02,749
Sooner or later, we've got to work at it.

1159
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:07,169
No matter how many
other careers we've had or wanted.

1160
01:24:08,546 --> 01:24:12,299
And in the last analysis,
nothing's any good unless you can

1161
01:24:12,383 --> 01:24:15,010
look up just before dinner or

1162
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:17,721
turn around in bed and there he is.

1163
01:24:17,804 --> 01:24:20,098
Without that, you're not a woman.

1164
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:25,645
You're something with a French provincial
office or a... a book full of clippings.

1165
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:29,482
But you're not a woman.

1166
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:35,487
Slow curtain. The end.

1167
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:42,827
Margo. Margo, I wantyou
to know how sorry I am about this.

1168
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,788
- About what?
- This.

1169
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:48,541
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1170
01:24:48,624 --> 01:24:51,627
Don't give it a thought.
One of destiny's merry pranks.

1171
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:56,340
After all, you didn't personally
drain the gasoline tank yourself.

1172
01:25:03,263 --> 01:25:05,515
Eve, of course, was superb.

1173
01:25:05,598 --> 01:25:10,686
Many of the audience understandably
preferred to return another time to see Margo.

1174
01:25:10,769 --> 01:25:15,315
But those who remained cheered loudly,
lustily and longfor Eve.

1175
01:25:15,399 --> 01:25:19,069
How thoughtful of her to call
and invite me that afternoon.

1176
01:25:19,152 --> 01:25:22,530
And what a happy coincidence
that several representatives

1177
01:25:22,614 --> 01:25:25,116
of other newspapers happened to be present.

1178
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,493
All of us invited that afternoon

1179
01:25:27,577 --> 01:25:32,247
to attend an understudy's performance,
about which the management knew nothing

1180
01:25:32,331 --> 01:25:35,917
until they were forced
to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock.

1181
01:25:36,001 --> 01:25:37,419
Coincidence.

1182
01:25:37,502 --> 01:25:39,838
You were better than all right.

1183
01:25:39,921 --> 01:25:43,508
You rang a bell. Little things
here and there, but it doesn't matter.

1184
01:25:43,591 --> 01:25:46,135
Be proud of yourself. You've got a right to be.

1185
01:25:46,219 --> 01:25:48,304
Are you proud of me, Bill?

1186
01:25:48,387 --> 01:25:51,432
I admit I was worried
when Max called. I had my doubts.

1187
01:25:51,682 --> 01:25:55,978
- You shouldn't have had any doubts.
- After all, the other day was one scene.

1188
01:25:56,061 --> 01:25:58,647
The woods are full of one-scene sensations.

1189
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:02,609
But you did it. With work and patience,
you'll be a good actress

1190
01:26:02,692 --> 01:26:05,987
- if that's whatyou wanna be.
- Is that whatyou want me to be?

1191
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:10,157
- I'm talking aboutyou and whatyou want.
- So am I.

1192
01:26:12,117 --> 01:26:15,454
- What have I got to do with it?
- Everything.

1193
01:26:17,998 --> 01:26:22,710
The names I've been called,
but never Svengali. Good luck.

1194
01:26:25,505 --> 01:26:28,174
Don't run away, Bill.

1195
01:26:28,257 --> 01:26:30,759
From what would I be running?

1196
01:26:32,553 --> 01:26:36,473
You're always after truth
on the stage. What about off?

1197
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:40,560
- I'm for it.
- Then face it. I have.

1198
01:26:40,894 --> 01:26:46,315
- Ever since that first night in here.
- I told you what every actress should know.

1199
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:50,402
You told me that whatever I became,
it would be because of you.

1200
01:26:50,486 --> 01:26:53,489
- Make-up's a little heavy.
- And for you.

1201
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:57,451
- You're quite a girl.
- You think?

1202
01:26:57,534 --> 01:27:02,539
- I'm in love with Margo. Hadn'tyou heard?
- You hear all kinds of things.

1203
01:27:02,622 --> 01:27:06,542
I'm only human, rumours to the contrary,
and I'm as curious as the next man.

1204
01:27:06,626 --> 01:27:09,545
- Find out.
- Only thing:

1205
01:27:09,628 --> 01:27:11,880
what I go after I want to go after.

1206
01:27:11,964 --> 01:27:14,049
I don't want it to come after me.

1207
01:27:21,014 --> 01:27:24,809
Don't cry. Just score it
as an incomplete forward pass.

1208
01:27:46,913 --> 01:27:48,998
Who is it?

1209
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:52,793
May I come in?

1210
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:55,921
Certainly, Mr DeWitt.

1211
01:27:58,965 --> 01:28:03,094
I expected to find this room
with a theatreful of people atyour feet.

1212
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:07,682
- I'm lucky they didn't throwthings.
- Your performance was no surprise to me.

1213
01:28:07,765 --> 01:28:11,227
After the other day, I regarded it
as simply a promise fulfilled.

1214
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:15,355
You're more than kind. But it's
still Miss Channing's performance.

1215
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:18,733
I'm the carbon copy you read
when you can't find the original.

1216
01:28:18,817 --> 01:28:24,072
- You're more than modest.
- It's not modesty. I don't try to kid myself.

1217
01:28:24,155 --> 01:28:26,532
A revolutionary approach to the theatre.

1218
01:28:26,616 --> 01:28:31,078
- But if I may make a suggestion...
- Please do.

1219
01:28:31,161 --> 01:28:34,206
I thinkthe time has come
to shed some of your humility.

1220
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:38,502
It is just as false not to blow your horn
at all as it is to blow it too loudly.

1221
01:28:38,793 --> 01:28:41,629
I don't think I've done anything
to sound off about.

1222
01:28:41,713 --> 01:28:45,800
We come into this world with our little
egos equipped with individual horns.

1223
01:28:45,883 --> 01:28:47,969
If we don't blowthem, who else will?

1224
01:28:48,052 --> 01:28:54,475
Even so... one pretty good performance by
an understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow.

1225
01:28:55,809 --> 01:28:58,687
It needn't be.

1226
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:04,400
Even if I wanted to, as you say,
be less humble, blow my own horn,

1227
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:08,612
how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.

1228
01:29:09,738 --> 01:29:13,158
- I'm somebody.
- You certainly are.

1229
01:29:14,618 --> 01:29:18,205
Leave the door open a bit... so we can talk.

1230
01:29:22,876 --> 01:29:27,463
After you change, if you're not busy
elsewhere, we could have supper.

1231
01:29:27,755 --> 01:29:30,883
I'd love to. Or should I pretend I'm busy?

1232
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:35,470
Let's have a minimum of pretending.
I shall want to do a column aboutyou.

1233
01:29:35,554 --> 01:29:37,889
I'm not even enough for a paragraph.

1234
01:29:37,973 --> 01:29:42,810
Perhaps more than one. There's so much
I want to know. I've heard your story in part.

1235
01:29:42,894 --> 01:29:47,732
Your home in Wisconsin, your tragic
marriage, your fanatical attachment to Margo.

1236
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:50,860
It started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1237
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:56,198
I say your idolatry of Margo
started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1238
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:57,491
That's right.

1239
01:29:57,574 --> 01:30:01,494
San Francisco, an oasis of
civilisation in the California desert.

1240
01:30:01,578 --> 01:30:05,873
Tell me, do you share
my high opinion of San Francisco?

1241
01:30:05,957 --> 01:30:08,042
Yes, I do.

1242
01:30:08,751 --> 01:30:13,047
And that memorable night when Margo
first dazzled you from the stage,

1243
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:17,300
what theatre was it in San Francisco?
Was it the Shubert?

1244
01:30:17,384 --> 01:30:19,469
Yes, the Shubert.

1245
01:30:20,053 --> 01:30:23,765
Fine old theatre, the Shubert. Full of tradition.

1246
01:30:23,848 --> 01:30:27,602
Untouched by the earthquake.
Or should I say fire?

1247
01:30:27,727 --> 01:30:30,479
Tell me, what was your husband's name?

1248
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,565
- Eddie.
- Eddie what?

1249
01:30:37,486 --> 01:30:41,322
I'm about to go into the shower.
I won't be able to hear you.

1250
01:30:41,406 --> 01:30:43,283
Well, it can wait.

1251
01:30:43,366 --> 01:30:46,619
Where would you like to go?
We must make this a special night.

1252
01:30:46,702 --> 01:30:49,955
You take charge.

1253
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:51,915
I believe I will.

1254
01:31:06,137 --> 01:31:10,015
Some morning papers carried
a squib about Eve's performance.

1255
01:31:10,099 --> 01:31:12,559
Not much, but full of praise.

1256
01:31:12,643 --> 01:31:15,229
I couldn't imagine
how they found out about it.

1257
01:31:15,312 --> 01:31:19,482
But Lloyd said Max's publicity man
probably sent out the story.

1258
01:31:19,566 --> 01:31:22,902
At any rate, lfelt terribly guilty
and ashamed of myself

1259
01:31:22,986 --> 01:31:26,364
and wanted nothing so much
as to forget the whole thing.

1260
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:28,783
Margo and I were having lunch at 21,

1261
01:31:28,866 --> 01:31:31,493
just like girlfriends... with hats on.

1262
01:31:33,579 --> 01:31:35,914
- Has Miss Channing come in?
- Notyet.

1263
01:31:35,998 --> 01:31:38,083
Thank you.

1264
01:31:39,084 --> 01:31:43,463
Eve! I've heard the most wonderful
things aboutyour performance.

1265
01:31:43,546 --> 01:31:47,049
- Relief that I managed to stagger through it.
- She was magnificent.

1266
01:31:47,133 --> 01:31:49,385
- Then you've heard, too.
- I was there.

1267
01:31:49,468 --> 01:31:52,471
- You were at the play last night?
- A happy coincidence.

1268
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:56,808
- We're having lunch with a talent scout.
- They certainly don't waste much time.

1269
01:31:56,892 --> 01:32:00,687
- It's nothing definite. Just lunch.
- They'll be wasting their time.

1270
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:03,815
Eve has no intention of going to Hollywood.

1271
01:32:03,898 --> 01:32:07,151
By your smart dress,
I take ityour companion is a lady?

1272
01:32:07,235 --> 01:32:09,528
- Margo.
- Margo lunching in public?

1273
01:32:09,612 --> 01:32:12,448
It's a new Margo,
but she's just as late as the old one.

1274
01:32:12,531 --> 01:32:15,033
She may be later than you think.

1275
01:32:18,495 --> 01:32:21,289
Why not read my column to pass the time?

1276
01:32:21,372 --> 01:32:24,208
- The minutes will fly like hours.
- Thank you, Addison.

1277
01:32:24,292 --> 01:32:26,919
Now we must join our sunburnt eager beaver.

1278
01:32:27,003 --> 01:32:29,088
- Goodbye, Karen.
- Goodbye.

1279
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:54,736
"And so my hat which has,
lo, these many seasons,

1280
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:58,615
become firmly rooted about my ears,
is lifted to Miss Harrington."

1281
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:02,702
"I am available for dancing in the streets
and shouting from the housetops."

1282
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:06,581
I thought that one went out with Woollcott.
Now listen to this.

1283
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:11,001
"Miss Harrington had much to tell and
these columns shall report her faithfully

1284
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:15,005
about the lamentable practice
in our theatre of permitting

1285
01:33:15,088 --> 01:33:18,008
mature actresses to continue playing roles

1286
01:33:18,091 --> 01:33:22,512
requiring a youth and vigour
of which they retain but a dim memory."

1287
01:33:22,595 --> 01:33:25,723
- I just can't believe it.
- It gets better.

1288
01:33:25,807 --> 01:33:30,352
"About the understandable reluctance
of our entrenched first ladies of the stage

1289
01:33:30,436 --> 01:33:33,272
to encourage, shall we say,
younger actresses,

1290
01:33:33,355 --> 01:33:36,900
and Miss Harrington's unsupported
struggle for opportunity."

1291
01:33:36,983 --> 01:33:40,111
- I can't believe Eve said those things.
- In this rat race,

1292
01:33:40,195 --> 01:33:42,906
everybody's guilty till proved innocent.

1293
01:33:42,989 --> 01:33:47,660
One of the differences between
the theatre and civilisation.

1294
01:33:47,743 --> 01:33:52,748
What gets me is how all the papers happened
to catch that particular performance.

1295
01:33:52,831 --> 01:33:54,917
Lloyd says it's a publicity release.

1296
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,794
The witch must have sent out Indian Runners,

1297
01:33:57,878 --> 01:34:03,091
snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms
and museums or wherever they hole up.

1298
01:34:03,174 --> 01:34:06,969
She won't get away with it.
Nor will Addison DeWitt and his poison pen.

1299
01:34:07,053 --> 01:34:10,681
If Equity or my lawyer can't
or won't do anything about it,

1300
01:34:10,764 --> 01:34:17,187
I shall personally stuff that pathetic little
lost lamb down Mr DeWitt's ugly throat!

1301
01:34:26,737 --> 01:34:31,367
I came as soon as I read that piece of filth.
I ran all the way.

1302
01:34:42,752 --> 01:34:45,129
Bill's here, baby.

1303
01:34:45,213 --> 01:34:47,298
Everything's all right now.

1304
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:59,059
I guess at this point
I'm what the French call "de trop".

1305
01:34:59,142 --> 01:35:01,853
Maybe just a little around the edges.

1306
01:35:14,615 --> 01:35:18,535
It's Addison from start to finish.
It drips with his brand of venom.

1307
01:35:18,618 --> 01:35:21,246
Taking advantage of a kid,
twisting her words,

1308
01:35:21,329 --> 01:35:24,123
making her say what he wanted her to say.

1309
01:35:24,207 --> 01:35:27,710
- Where did you get all that information?
- Eve.

1310
01:35:27,793 --> 01:35:30,796
- Eve?
- She's been to see me.

1311
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,174
She left just before you came in.
You just missed her.

1312
01:35:34,258 --> 01:35:37,761
- That was a pity.
- Wanted to explain about the interview.

1313
01:35:37,844 --> 01:35:41,639
Wanted to apologise to someone,
and didn't dare face Margo.

1314
01:35:41,723 --> 01:35:45,643
- I wonder why.
- She started talking and couldn't finish.

1315
01:35:45,726 --> 01:35:47,812
She cried so.

1316
01:35:49,355 --> 01:35:53,484
I've been going over our financial position,
if you'll pardon the expression.

1317
01:35:53,567 --> 01:35:58,071
- That's quite a change of subject.
- What with taxes coming up, and,

1318
01:35:58,155 --> 01:36:02,033
since I'm a playwright and not
an oil-well operator, I was thinking...

1319
01:36:02,116 --> 01:36:04,410
I'm trying hard to follow you.

1320
01:36:04,494 --> 01:36:08,205
Instead of waiting until next season
to do Footsteps on the Ceiling,

1321
01:36:08,289 --> 01:36:10,166
which is in pretty good shape,

1322
01:36:10,249 --> 01:36:14,169
and if Margo can be talked into
going on tour with Aged in Wood,

1323
01:36:14,253 --> 01:36:17,380
we could put Footsteps
into production right away.

1324
01:36:17,464 --> 01:36:21,259
- I'm beginning to catch up.
- If we can cast it properly, that is.

1325
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:26,180
Maybe get some younger actress? Someone
who'd lookthe part as well as play it?

1326
01:36:26,264 --> 01:36:30,893
- You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty.
- Now you're quoting Addison... or Eve.

1327
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:33,395
Eve did mention the play, but in passing.

1328
01:36:33,479 --> 01:36:36,481
She'd never have the nerve
to askto play a part like Cora.

1329
01:36:36,565 --> 01:36:39,693
Eve would askAbbott to give her Costello.

1330
01:36:39,776 --> 01:36:43,071
I got the idea myself while
she was talking about the play.

1331
01:36:43,154 --> 01:36:45,990
- With gestures, of course.
- To write something

1332
01:36:46,073 --> 01:36:50,870
and have it realised completely.
For once, not to compromise.

1333
01:36:51,537 --> 01:36:56,124
Lloyd Richards, do not consider giving
that contemptible little worm the part of Cora!

1334
01:36:56,208 --> 01:37:01,171
- Now just a minute...
- Margo's not been exactly a compromise.

1335
01:37:01,254 --> 01:37:04,966
Playwrights everywhere would
give their shirts for that compromise.

1336
01:37:05,049 --> 01:37:06,175
Now just a minute...

1337
01:37:06,259 --> 01:37:09,720
Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude
must be contagious.

1338
01:37:09,804 --> 01:37:13,432
All this hysteria because
of an impulsive excited kid

1339
01:37:13,515 --> 01:37:16,435
and a professional
manure-slinger named DeWitt.

1340
01:37:16,518 --> 01:37:20,397
- She apologised, didn't she?
- On her knees, I've no doubt.

1341
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,608
Very touching.
Very Academy of Dramatic Arts.

1342
01:37:23,691 --> 01:37:27,737
That bitter cynicism is something
you've acquired since you left Radcliffe.

1343
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:33,158
That cynicism I acquired the day I
discovered I was different from little boys.

1344
01:37:34,535 --> 01:37:36,244
Hello.

1345
01:37:36,703 --> 01:37:39,039
Hi, Margo.

1346
01:37:39,122 --> 01:37:41,416
No, not at all.

1347
01:37:42,876 --> 01:37:45,670
Karen and I were just chatting.

1348
01:37:48,798 --> 01:37:52,176
Yes, I'm sure we can
and I'm sure we'd love to.

1349
01:37:52,718 --> 01:37:55,387
Right. 11.45ish.

1350
01:37:57,305 --> 01:37:59,391
See you then.

1351
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:05,897
Margo and Bill want us to meet them
at the Cub Room tonight after the theatre.

1352
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,607
Margo Channing in the Cub Room.

1353
01:38:08,691 --> 01:38:12,152
I couldn't be more surprised
if she'd said Grant's tomb.

1354
01:38:12,236 --> 01:38:16,406
- I'm glad Bill's back.
- They'd die without each other.

1355
01:38:17,449 --> 01:38:20,952
I didn't promise Eve anything.
I said she'd be fine for the part

1356
01:38:21,035 --> 01:38:23,329
but there were practical difficulties.

1357
01:38:23,413 --> 01:38:25,498
- Such as?
- You, for one.

1358
01:38:25,581 --> 01:38:29,752
I told her you wanted Margo to play
the part and I would wantyour approval.

1359
01:38:29,835 --> 01:38:32,004
That's fine. Fine and dandy.

1360
01:38:32,087 --> 01:38:36,258
Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington's
future requests to me.

1361
01:38:40,303 --> 01:38:44,849
The so-called art of acting is not one
for which I have a particularly high regard.

1362
01:38:44,932 --> 01:38:47,810
- Hear, hear.
- Butyou may quote me as follows:

1363
01:38:47,893 --> 01:38:53,065
"Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave
a performance in your cockamamie play,

1364
01:38:53,148 --> 01:38:59,279
the like of which I have never seen before
and expect rarely to see again."

1365
01:38:59,362 --> 01:39:02,949
- He does not exaggerate. I was good.
- You were great.

1366
01:39:03,032 --> 01:39:08,329
Quite a night. I hear your understudy,
a Miss Harrington, has given her notice.

1367
01:39:08,412 --> 01:39:10,539
- Too bad.
- I'm broken up about it.

1368
01:39:10,623 --> 01:39:13,500
You just can't pick up
champagne and drink it.

1369
01:39:13,584 --> 01:39:16,086
Somebody's got to be
very witty about a toast.

1370
01:39:16,169 --> 01:39:18,255
I shall propose the toast,

1371
01:39:18,338 --> 01:39:21,466
without wit, with all my heart.

1372
01:39:22,467 --> 01:39:24,218
To Margo.

1373
01:39:24,302 --> 01:39:27,430
- To my bride-to-be.
- Glory hallelujah.

1374
01:39:27,638 --> 01:39:29,723
- Margo.
- Drink.

1375
01:39:32,726 --> 01:39:36,772
- When? When are you going to do it?
- Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten.

1376
01:39:36,855 --> 01:39:39,566
- And you're going to be on time.
- Yes, sir.

1377
01:39:39,649 --> 01:39:45,029
City Hall, that's for prizefighters and
reporters. I see a cathedral, banks of flowers...

1378
01:39:45,113 --> 01:39:48,991
It's only for the licence.
There's a three-day wait for blood tests.

1379
01:39:49,075 --> 01:39:52,286
I'll marry you if it turns out
you have no blood at all.

1380
01:39:52,578 --> 01:39:55,497
- What are you going to wear?
- Something simple,

1381
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:57,624
a fur coat over a nightgown.

1382
01:39:57,707 --> 01:40:02,712
The point is this. In a cathedral,
a ballpark or a penny arcade,

1383
01:40:02,795 --> 01:40:06,716
we wantyou two beside us,
as our nearest and dearest friends.

1384
01:40:06,799 --> 01:40:10,136
Which we are. Which we'll always be.

1385
01:40:10,219 --> 01:40:14,973
There are very few moments in life
as good as this. Let's remember it.

1386
01:40:15,057 --> 01:40:18,935
To each of us and all of us -
never have we been more close.

1387
01:40:19,019 --> 01:40:21,521
May we never be farther apart.

1388
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:25,858
- Mrs Richards?
- Yes.

1389
01:40:25,942 --> 01:40:28,027
- For you.
- Thank you.

1390
01:40:29,236 --> 01:40:32,281
Very indiscreet. A note in the open like that.

1391
01:40:32,364 --> 01:40:35,617
Next time, tell your lover
to blow smoke rings or tap a glass.

1392
01:40:35,701 --> 01:40:38,036
Lloyd, I wantyou to be big about this.

1393
01:40:38,119 --> 01:40:41,748
The world is full of love tonight.
No woman is safe.

1394
01:40:41,831 --> 01:40:47,461
Well, this beats all world's records
for running, jumping or standing gall.

1395
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:52,383
"Forgive my butting in to what
seems such a happy occasion,

1396
01:40:52,466 --> 01:40:54,760
but it's important that I speak with you."

1397
01:40:54,843 --> 01:40:57,304
"Please", and that's underlined,

1398
01:40:57,387 --> 01:41:00,432
"meet me in the ladies' room. Eve."

1399
01:41:01,224 --> 01:41:04,602
I understand she's now
the understudy in there.

1400
01:41:04,686 --> 01:41:07,396
Hand me that empty bottle. I may find her.

1401
01:41:09,648 --> 01:41:12,484
Well, look. There's Rasputin.

1402
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:23,494
- More champagne, Miss Channing?
- That's what I said, bub.

1403
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:28,666
- Maybe she just wants to apologise.
- I have no interest in anything she may say.

1404
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:32,211
But what could she say?
That's what fascinates me.

1405
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:36,631
- Go on, find out.
- Karen, in all the years of our friendship,

1406
01:41:36,715 --> 01:41:40,301
I have never letyou go
to the ladies' room alone.

1407
01:41:40,385 --> 01:41:43,221
Now I must. I am busting to find out

1408
01:41:43,304 --> 01:41:47,808
what's going on in that feverish
little brain waiting in there.

1409
01:41:49,435 --> 01:41:52,563
Well... all right.

1410
01:41:57,651 --> 01:41:59,653
Karen!

1411
01:41:59,736 --> 01:42:01,821
How nice.

1412
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:16,209
Very effective, but why take it out on me?

1413
01:42:41,274 --> 01:42:43,484
I was wondering whether you'd come at all.

1414
01:42:43,568 --> 01:42:46,529
Don't get up. And don't act
as if I were the Queen Mother.

1415
01:42:46,612 --> 01:42:48,698
I don't expectyou to be pleasant.

1416
01:42:48,781 --> 01:42:50,950
I don't intend to be.

1417
01:42:51,033 --> 01:42:55,037
Can't we sit down just for a minute?
I've got a lot to say and none of it's easy.

1418
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:57,581
- There can't be very much.
- But there is.

1419
01:42:57,664 --> 01:43:01,584
- Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it.
- Why should you?

1420
01:43:02,502 --> 01:43:04,587
Please sit down.

1421
01:43:10,176 --> 01:43:13,929
You know, I've always considered
myself a very clever girl.

1422
01:43:14,012 --> 01:43:17,265
Smart, good head on my shoulders,
that sort of thing.

1423
01:43:17,349 --> 01:43:20,852
Never the wrong word at the wrong time.

1424
01:43:20,935 --> 01:43:23,438
But then I'd never metAddison DeWitt.

1425
01:43:25,773 --> 01:43:27,942
I remember I had a tooth pulled once.

1426
01:43:28,025 --> 01:43:31,278
They gave me some anaesthetic.
I don't remember the name.

1427
01:43:31,362 --> 01:43:33,238
It affected me strangely.

1428
01:43:33,322 --> 01:43:37,033
I found myself saying things
I wasn't even thinking.

1429
01:43:37,117 --> 01:43:41,204
As if my mind was outside of my body
and couldn't control what I did or said.

1430
01:43:41,287 --> 01:43:44,707
- And you felt like that talking to Addison?
- In a way.

1431
01:43:44,791 --> 01:43:49,378
You find yourself trying to say what
you mean, but somehowthe words change.

1432
01:43:49,462 --> 01:43:51,547
They become his words.

1433
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:55,926
And suddenly you're not saying
what you mean, but what he means.

1434
01:43:56,009 --> 01:44:00,430
Do you expect me to believe thatyou didn't
say any of that? That they were all Addison?

1435
01:44:00,513 --> 01:44:02,891
I don't expectyou to believe anything,

1436
01:44:02,974 --> 01:44:07,061
except that the responsibility
is mine... and the disgrace.

1437
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:10,981
Let's not get overdramatic.

1438
01:44:12,608 --> 01:44:15,736
You really have a low opinion
of me, haven'tyou?

1439
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:18,947
I'll give you some pleasant news.

1440
01:44:19,030 --> 01:44:23,368
I've been told off
in no uncertain terms, all over town.

1441
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:25,953
Miss Channing should be happy to hear that.

1442
01:44:26,037 --> 01:44:28,956
To know how Ioyal her friends are,

1443
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:33,252
how much more Ioyal than
she had a right to expect me to be.

1444
01:44:33,335 --> 01:44:36,254
- Eve, don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

1445
01:44:38,089 --> 01:44:42,218
Tell me, how did your luncheon
turn out with the man from Hollywood?

1446
01:44:42,302 --> 01:44:47,515
Some vague promises of a test. If a particular
part should come along, one of those things.

1447
01:44:47,598 --> 01:44:51,977
- But the raves aboutyour performance...
- An understudy's performance.

1448
01:44:52,061 --> 01:44:56,898
Well, I think you're painting
the picture a little blacker than it is, really.

1449
01:44:56,982 --> 01:45:01,236
Don't underestimate him.
You have a powerful friend in Addison.

1450
01:45:01,569 --> 01:45:04,113
He's not my friend. You were my friends.

1451
01:45:04,197 --> 01:45:07,116
- He can help you.
- I wish I'd never met him.

1452
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:09,285
I'd like him to be dead.

1453
01:45:09,368 --> 01:45:11,453
I want my friends back.

1454
01:45:12,371 --> 01:45:17,125
Eve... I don't think
you meant to cause unhappiness.

1455
01:45:17,209 --> 01:45:21,504
But you did. More to yourself perhaps,
as it turned out, than to anyone else.

1456
01:45:21,588 --> 01:45:24,716
- I'll never get over it.
- Yes, you will.

1457
01:45:24,799 --> 01:45:29,428
You theatre people always do.
Nothing is for ever in the theatre.

1458
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:33,807
Whatever it is, it's here, it flares up, burns hot,

1459
01:45:33,891 --> 01:45:35,976
and it's gone.

1460
01:45:36,518 --> 01:45:40,313
- I wish I could believe that.
- Give yourself time.

1461
01:45:40,397 --> 01:45:42,982
Don't worry too much
about what people think.

1462
01:45:43,066 --> 01:45:45,777
You're very young and very talented.

1463
01:45:46,944 --> 01:45:51,323
And, believe it or not,
if there's anything I can do...

1464
01:45:51,407 --> 01:45:53,867
There is something.

1465
01:45:56,244 --> 01:46:00,832
- I think I know.
- Something most importantyou can do.

1466
01:46:01,207 --> 01:46:05,461
You wanna play Cora. You want me
to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.

1467
01:46:05,711 --> 01:46:08,756
If you told him so, he'd give me
the part. He said he would.

1468
01:46:08,839 --> 01:46:13,677
After all you've said. Don'tyou know
that part was written for Margo?

1469
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,555
It might've been 15 years ago.
It's my part now.

1470
01:46:16,638 --> 01:46:22,060
- You talk just as Addison said you did.
- Cora is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd.

1471
01:46:22,352 --> 01:46:26,564
- Nothing in the world will make me say that.
- Addison wants me to play it.

1472
01:46:26,647 --> 01:46:29,775
- Over my dead body.
- That won't be necessary.

1473
01:46:30,151 --> 01:46:33,821
Addison knows how Margo
happened to miss that performance,

1474
01:46:33,904 --> 01:46:39,159
how I happened to know she'd miss it
in time to notify every paper in town.

1475
01:46:39,242 --> 01:46:42,662
It's quite a story.
Addison could make quite a thing of it.

1476
01:46:42,745 --> 01:46:47,041
Imagine how snide and vicious he could get,
and still tell nothing but the truth.

1477
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:49,919
I had a time persuading him.

1478
01:46:51,170 --> 01:46:54,298
You better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.

1479
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:03,431
If I play Cora, Addison will never
tell what happened, in or out of print.

1480
01:47:03,514 --> 01:47:06,601
A simple exchange of favours.

1481
01:47:06,684 --> 01:47:10,146
I'm so happy I can do something
for you at long last.

1482
01:47:12,314 --> 01:47:14,525
Your friendship with Margo,

1483
01:47:14,608 --> 01:47:17,194
your deep, close friendship.

1484
01:47:17,611 --> 01:47:23,157
What would happen to it if she knewthe
cheap trick you played on her for my benefit?

1485
01:47:23,241 --> 01:47:27,036
You and Lloyd, how long, even in the theatre,

1486
01:47:28,204 --> 01:47:32,374
before people forgot what happened
and trusted you again?

1487
01:47:34,376 --> 01:47:36,086
No.

1488
01:47:37,295 --> 01:47:41,633
It would be so much easier for everyone
concerned if I were to play Cora.

1489
01:47:41,716 --> 01:47:44,218
So much better theatre, too.

1490
01:47:45,053 --> 01:47:47,138
A part in a play.

1491
01:47:48,347 --> 01:47:51,684
You'd do all that just for a part in a play?

1492
01:47:51,767 --> 01:47:54,686
I'd do much more for a part that good.

1493
01:48:17,999 --> 01:48:20,085
Hungry?

1494
01:48:21,878 --> 01:48:25,590
I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie.

1495
01:48:25,673 --> 01:48:29,468
Nothing of the kind.
Karen and I had a nice talk.

1496
01:48:29,552 --> 01:48:31,637
Heart to heart? Woman to woman?

1497
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:36,433
Including a casual reference to the part
of Cora and your hopes of playing it?

1498
01:48:36,516 --> 01:48:41,312
I discussed it very openly. I told her I'd
spoken to Lloyd, and that he was interested.

1499
01:48:41,396 --> 01:48:45,691
And Karen mentioned, of course,
that Margo expects to play the part?

1500
01:48:45,775 --> 01:48:49,612
Oddly enough, she didn't
say a word about Margo.

1501
01:48:49,695 --> 01:48:54,241
Just that she'll be happy to do
what she can to see that I play it.

1502
01:48:55,534 --> 01:48:58,036
Just like that?

1503
01:48:58,119 --> 01:49:00,663
Just like that.

1504
01:49:00,747 --> 01:49:04,625
You know, Eve, sometimes
I think you keep things from me.

1505
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:09,255
- I don't thinkthat's funny.
- It wasn't meant to be.

1506
01:49:09,338 --> 01:49:13,133
I confide in you and rely on you
more than anyone I've ever known.

1507
01:49:13,217 --> 01:49:16,094
To say a thing like that now,
without any reason,

1508
01:49:16,178 --> 01:49:18,555
when I need you more than ever.

1509
01:49:18,638 --> 01:49:21,182
I hope you mean whatyou say.

1510
01:49:21,266 --> 01:49:23,768
I intend to hold you to it.

1511
01:49:25,103 --> 01:49:28,189
We have a great deal
in common, it seems to me.

1512
01:49:37,948 --> 01:49:41,743
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing much. She apologised.

1513
01:49:41,826 --> 01:49:43,786
- With tears?
- With tears.

1514
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:47,790
But not right away. First fight them back,
chin up, stout fellow.

1515
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:50,376
- Check.
- Very classy. Lots of technique.

1516
01:49:50,459 --> 01:49:55,297
You mean all this time she's done
nothing but apologise? What did you say?

1517
01:49:56,006 --> 01:49:58,091
Not much.

1518
01:50:00,593 --> 01:50:03,513
Groom, may I have a wedding present?

1519
01:50:03,596 --> 01:50:07,975
- What would you like? Texas?
- I want everybody to shut up about Eve.

1520
01:50:08,059 --> 01:50:10,936
Just shut up about Eve. That's all I want.

1521
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:13,147
Give Karen more wine.

1522
01:50:13,230 --> 01:50:15,357
Never have I been so happy.

1523
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:18,610
Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room.

1524
01:50:18,693 --> 01:50:23,031
What a lovely, clever name.
Where the elite meet.

1525
01:50:23,114 --> 01:50:27,451
Never have I seen so much elite,
all with their eyes on me,

1526
01:50:27,535 --> 01:50:31,997
waiting for me to crackthat little
gnome on the noggin with a bottle.

1527
01:50:32,081 --> 01:50:36,501
But not tonight. I'm forgiving tonight.
Even Eve. I forgive Eve.

1528
01:50:37,502 --> 01:50:39,838
There they go.

1529
01:50:41,005 --> 01:50:42,715
There goes Eve.

1530
01:50:42,799 --> 01:50:45,885
Eve Evil, little Miss Evil.

1531
01:50:47,178 --> 01:50:50,139
But "the evil that men do..."
How does that go, groom?

1532
01:50:50,222 --> 01:50:55,102
Something about the good they leave behind.
I played it once in rep in Wilkes-Barre.

1533
01:50:55,185 --> 01:50:57,938
You've got it backwards,
even for Wilkes-Barre.

1534
01:50:58,021 --> 01:51:01,691
Do you know why I forgive Eve?
She left good behind.

1535
01:51:01,983 --> 01:51:06,362
The four of us here together -
it's Eve fault. I forgive her.

1536
01:51:06,988 --> 01:51:11,325
And Bill, especially Bill. She did that too.

1537
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:14,077
You know, she probably means well after all.

1538
01:51:14,161 --> 01:51:17,581
- She is a louse.
- Never try to outguess Margo.

1539
01:51:18,248 --> 01:51:20,500
- Groom?
- Yes, dear.

1540
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:22,877
- Do you know what I'm going to be?
- A cowboy?

1541
01:51:22,961 --> 01:51:26,047
- A married lady.
- With a paper to prove it.

1542
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:29,967
I'm going to look up at six o'clock,
and there he'll be.

1543
01:51:30,676 --> 01:51:33,429
- Remember, Karen?
- I remember.

1544
01:51:34,346 --> 01:51:38,308
- You'll be there, won'tyou?
- Often enough to keep the franchise.

1545
01:51:38,391 --> 01:51:41,061
No more make-believe, offstage or on.

1546
01:51:41,352 --> 01:51:43,896
Remember, Lloyd? I mean it now.

1547
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:47,149
Lloyd, will you promise
not to be angry with me?

1548
01:51:47,817 --> 01:51:50,611
- That depends.
- No, I mean deeply angry.

1549
01:51:50,861 --> 01:51:53,113
I don't think I could be.

1550
01:51:53,197 --> 01:51:56,199
Well, I don't want to play Cora.

1551
01:51:56,533 --> 01:51:59,786
- What?
- You're always so touchy about his plays.

1552
01:51:59,869 --> 01:52:04,248
It isn't the part. It's a great part
and a fine play. But not for me any more.

1553
01:52:04,332 --> 01:52:08,669
Not for a foursquare, upright,
downright, forthright, married lady.

1554
01:52:08,919 --> 01:52:14,716
- What's your being married got to do with it?
- It means I've finally got a life to live.

1555
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,719
I don't have to play parts I'm too old for

1556
01:52:17,803 --> 01:52:21,222
just because I've got
nothing to do with my nights.

1557
01:52:22,098 --> 01:52:24,726
Lloyd, I'll make it up to you, believe me.

1558
01:52:24,809 --> 01:52:29,730
I'll tour a year with this one, anything.
Only you do understand, don'tyou?

1559
01:52:36,653 --> 01:52:39,114
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

1560
01:52:39,531 --> 01:52:43,076
- Nothing?
- Everything. Everything's so funny.

1561
01:52:55,087 --> 01:52:57,714
Lloyd never got around to asking

1562
01:52:57,798 --> 01:53:01,885
whether it was all right with me
for Eve to play Cora.

1563
01:53:01,968 --> 01:53:07,056
Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct
the play at first... with Eve in it.

1564
01:53:07,139 --> 01:53:09,934
Lloyd and Max finally won him over.

1565
01:53:10,017 --> 01:53:16,106
Margo never came to rehearsal.
Too much to do around the house, she said.

1566
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:20,151
I'd never known Bill and Lloyd
to fight as bitterly and often,

1567
01:53:20,235 --> 01:53:22,904
and always over some business for Eve,

1568
01:53:22,987 --> 01:53:26,407
or a move, or the way she read a speech.

1569
01:53:26,657 --> 01:53:30,411
But I'd never known Lloyd
to meddle as much with Bill's directing,

1570
01:53:30,494 --> 01:53:33,789
as far as it affected Eve, that is.

1571
01:53:33,872 --> 01:53:36,500
Somehow Eve kept them going.

1572
01:53:36,583 --> 01:53:40,128
Bill stuck it out. Lloyd seemed happy.

1573
01:53:44,007 --> 01:53:48,344
And I thought it might be best
if I skipped rehearsals from then on.

1574
01:53:50,054 --> 01:53:54,349
It seemed to me I had known always
that it would happen. And here it was.

1575
01:53:54,433 --> 01:53:59,354
I felt helpless. That helplessness you
feel when you have no talent to offer,

1576
01:53:59,437 --> 01:54:01,689
outside of loving your husband.

1577
01:54:01,773 --> 01:54:05,776
How could I compete?
Everything Lloyd loved about me,

1578
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:07,945
he'd gotten used to long ago.

1579
01:54:13,534 --> 01:54:15,077
Hello?

1580
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:17,454
Who? Who's calling Mr Richards?

1581
01:54:17,537 --> 01:54:21,666
My name wouldn't mean anything.
I room across the hall from Eve Harrington.

1582
01:54:21,749 --> 01:54:25,294
She isn't well. She's been crying
all night and she's hysterical.

1583
01:54:25,378 --> 01:54:27,546
She doesn't want a doctor and...

1584
01:54:28,005 --> 01:54:30,090
Who is it? What's it all about?

1585
01:54:30,174 --> 01:54:34,678
- Did Miss Harrington tell you to call?
- No. Eve didn't say to call him.

1586
01:54:34,761 --> 01:54:40,183
I saw Mr Richards with her a couple of times.
I thought, they being such good friends...

1587
01:54:40,266 --> 01:54:43,436
This is Lloyd Richards.
Where is Eve? Let me talkto her.

1588
01:54:43,519 --> 01:54:46,814
Hello, Mr Richards.
She's upstairs in her room.

1589
01:54:46,898 --> 01:54:50,693
I really hate to bother you this way,
but the way Eve's been feeling,

1590
01:54:50,776 --> 01:54:54,571
I've been worried sick, what with
her leaving tomorrowfor New Haven.

1591
01:54:54,655 --> 01:54:57,741
Tell her not to worry. Tell her I'll be right over.

1592
01:55:16,299 --> 01:55:19,678
To the theatre world,
New Haven, Connecticut,

1593
01:55:19,761 --> 01:55:24,599
is a short stretch of sidewalk between
the Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel,

1594
01:55:24,682 --> 01:55:28,227
surrounded by what looks
very much like a small city.

1595
01:55:28,310 --> 01:55:33,315
It is here that managers have
what are called out-of-town openings,

1596
01:55:33,398 --> 01:55:37,652
which are openings for New Yorkers
who want to go out of town.

1597
01:55:38,403 --> 01:55:41,739
What a day. What a heavenly day.

1598
01:55:41,823 --> 01:55:44,909
- D-day.
- Just like it.

1599
01:55:44,992 --> 01:55:49,330
Tomorrow morning, you will have won
your beachhead on the shores of immortality.

1600
01:55:49,413 --> 01:55:51,498
Stop rehearsing your column.

1601
01:55:52,458 --> 01:55:54,459
Isn't it strange, Addison?

1602
01:55:54,543 --> 01:55:58,880
I thought I'd be panic-stricken,
want to run away or something.

1603
01:55:58,964 --> 01:56:03,176
Instead, I can't wait for tonight
to come. To come and go.

1604
01:56:03,259 --> 01:56:05,470
Are you that sure of tomorrow?

1605
01:56:05,553 --> 01:56:08,222
- Aren'tyou?
- Frankly, yes.

1606
01:56:14,811 --> 01:56:16,897
It'll be a night to remember.

1607
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:19,733
It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted.

1608
01:56:19,816 --> 01:56:22,485
The end of an old road,
the beginning of a new one.

1609
01:56:22,569 --> 01:56:26,822
- All paved with diamonds and gold?
- You know me better than that.

1610
01:56:26,906 --> 01:56:28,991
Paved with what, then?

1611
01:56:29,909 --> 01:56:31,994
Stars.

1612
01:56:33,078 --> 01:56:35,080
What time?

1613
01:56:35,163 --> 01:56:37,249
Almost four.

1614
01:56:37,833 --> 01:56:40,168
Plenty of time for a nice, long nap.

1615
01:56:40,251 --> 01:56:42,795
We rehearsed most of last night.

1616
01:56:42,879 --> 01:56:45,089
You could sleep now, couldn'tyou?

1617
01:56:45,173 --> 01:56:48,259
- Why not?
- The mark of a true killer.

1618
01:56:49,218 --> 01:56:52,429
Sleep tight, rest easy and come out fighting.

1619
01:56:52,513 --> 01:56:55,265
Why did you call me a killer?

1620
01:56:55,349 --> 01:56:59,602
Did I say killer? I meant champion.
I get my boxing terms mixed.

1621
01:57:00,895 --> 01:57:04,273
Addison, come in for a minute, will you?

1622
01:57:04,357 --> 01:57:06,859
I've got something to tell you.

1623
01:57:16,743 --> 01:57:20,038
Suites are for expense accounts.
You're being extravagant.

1624
01:57:20,121 --> 01:57:25,001
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd
had a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted.

1625
01:57:25,918 --> 01:57:30,714
- Can I fix you a drink?
- With the reluctant compliments of Max?

1626
01:57:30,798 --> 01:57:33,300
Lloyd. I never have any.

1627
01:57:33,383 --> 01:57:36,678
He likes a few drinks after we finish,
so he sent it up.

1628
01:57:36,762 --> 01:57:40,849
Some plain soda. Lloyd must be
expecting a record run in New Haven.

1629
01:57:40,932 --> 01:57:44,435
That's for tonight. You're invited.

1630
01:57:44,519 --> 01:57:47,730
We're having everyone up
after the performance.

1631
01:57:47,813 --> 01:57:49,857
"We are"?

1632
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:52,026
Lloyd and I.

1633
01:57:53,235 --> 01:57:56,154
I find it odd that Karen
isn't here for the opening.

1634
01:57:56,238 --> 01:57:58,823
- Addison...
- She was always so devoted to Lloyd.

1635
01:57:58,907 --> 01:58:02,702
- One would think only death could keep her...
- Addison...

1636
01:58:02,785 --> 01:58:09,333
I said this would be a night to remember,
that it would bring me all I ever wanted.

1637
01:58:09,416 --> 01:58:14,046
Something about an old road ending
and a new one starting, all paved with stars.

1638
01:58:14,129 --> 01:58:16,673
I didn't mean just the theatre.

1639
01:58:16,757 --> 01:58:18,842
What else?

1640
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:24,138
Lloyd Richards.

1641
01:58:24,514 --> 01:58:28,142
He's going to leave Karen.
We're going to be married.

1642
01:58:29,477 --> 01:58:32,438
So that's it. Lloyd.

1643
01:58:32,521 --> 01:58:35,315
Still just the theatre, after all.

1644
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:37,359
It's nothing of the kind.

1645
01:58:37,442 --> 01:58:39,653
Lloyd loves me. I love him.

1646
01:58:39,903 --> 01:58:44,240
I know nothing of Lloyd's loves. I leave
those to Louisa May Alcott. But I know you.

1647
01:58:44,323 --> 01:58:49,245
- I'm in love with Lloyd.
- He is a commercially successful playwright.

1648
01:58:49,537 --> 01:58:53,165
- You have no right to say that.
- And, artistically, very promising.

1649
01:58:53,248 --> 01:58:55,500
Eve, dear, this is Addison.

1650
01:58:57,794 --> 01:59:00,046
Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?

1651
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:03,633
Lloyd and I.
There's no telling howfar we can go.

1652
01:59:03,716 --> 01:59:07,303
He'll write great plays for me.
I'll make them great.

1653
01:59:07,386 --> 01:59:10,347
You're the only one who knows,
except Lloyd and me.

1654
01:59:10,431 --> 01:59:12,516
- And Karen.
- She doesn't know.

1655
01:59:12,599 --> 01:59:15,602
- She knows enough not to be here.
- But not all of it.

1656
01:59:15,686 --> 01:59:18,813
- Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married.
- I see.

1657
01:59:19,272 --> 01:59:22,567
And when was this unholy alliance joined?

1658
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:26,195
We decided night before last,
before we came up here.

1659
01:59:26,279 --> 01:59:29,490
I trust the setting was properly romantic.

1660
01:59:29,573 --> 01:59:33,285
Lights on dimmers
and gypsy violins offstage.

1661
01:59:33,368 --> 01:59:35,787
The setting wasn't romantic,

1662
01:59:35,871 --> 01:59:37,914
but Lloyd was.

1663
01:59:37,998 --> 01:59:41,334
He woke me up at three o'clock
in the morning, banging on my door.

1664
01:59:41,417 --> 01:59:44,962
He couldn't sleep, he said. He'd left Karen.

1665
01:59:45,046 --> 01:59:49,592
Couldn't go on with the play or anything
else until I promised to marry him.

1666
01:59:49,675 --> 01:59:52,594
We sat and talked until it was light.

1667
01:59:52,678 --> 01:59:55,013
He never went home.

1668
01:59:55,097 --> 01:59:59,517
- You sat and talked until it was light?
- We sat and talked, Addison.

1669
02:00:00,602 --> 02:00:03,146
I want a run-of-the-play contract.

1670
02:00:04,689 --> 02:00:08,859
There never was, and there
never will be, another like you.

1671
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:12,446
Well, say something. Anything.

1672
02:00:12,529 --> 02:00:15,198
Congratulations. SkäI. Good work, Eve.

1673
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:26,792
- What do you take me for?
- I don't knowthat I "take you" for anything.

1674
02:00:26,876 --> 02:00:29,879
Is it possible thatyou've confused me

1675
02:00:29,962 --> 02:00:33,298
with those backward children
you've played tricks on?

1676
02:00:33,382 --> 02:00:36,218
That you have the same contempt
for me as for them?

1677
02:00:36,301 --> 02:00:39,012
I'm sure you mean something,
but I don't know what.

1678
02:00:39,095 --> 02:00:41,681
Look closely, Eve. It's time you did.

1679
02:00:42,182 --> 02:00:46,769
I am Addison DeWitt.
I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours.

1680
02:00:47,061 --> 02:00:51,231
- I never intended you to be.
- Yes, you did, and you still do.

1681
02:00:51,315 --> 02:00:54,985
I don't know whatyou mean.
But I want to take my nap. It's important...

1682
02:00:55,068 --> 02:00:58,947
- It's important that we talk, killer to killer.
- Champion to champion.

1683
02:00:59,030 --> 02:01:01,991
Not with me, you're no champion.
You're stepping up.

1684
02:01:02,075 --> 02:01:06,412
Please say whatyou have to say, plainly
and distinctly, and then let me take my nap.

1685
02:01:06,495 --> 02:01:12,334
Very well. Although it's unnecessary,
because you know what I'm going to say.

1686
02:01:12,418 --> 02:01:16,296
Lloyd may leave Karen,
but he will not leave Karen for you.

1687
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:20,675
- What do you mean by that?
- More plainly and more distinctly?

1688
02:01:20,759 --> 02:01:24,387
I have not come to New Haven
to see the play, discuss your dreams,

1689
02:01:24,470 --> 02:01:27,306
or pull the ivy from the walls of Yale.

1690
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:31,143
I came to tell you thatyou will
not marry Lloyd, or anyone else,

1691
02:01:31,226 --> 02:01:33,312
because I will not permit it.

1692
02:01:33,395 --> 02:01:35,981
- What have you got to do with it?
- Everything.

1693
02:01:36,314 --> 02:01:39,693
Because after tonightyou will belong to me.

1694
02:01:39,776 --> 02:01:43,196
Belong? To you?

1695
02:01:44,155 --> 02:01:46,240
I can't believe my ears.

1696
02:01:46,324 --> 02:01:48,284
A dull cliché.

1697
02:01:48,367 --> 02:01:50,536
"Belong" to you?

1698
02:01:50,619 --> 02:01:53,872
That sounds medieval.
Something out of an old melodrama.

1699
02:01:53,956 --> 02:01:57,125
So does the history of the world
for the past 20 years.

1700
02:01:57,209 --> 02:01:59,336
I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly.

1701
02:01:59,419 --> 02:02:02,922
I'd hoped thatyou would have
taken it for granted thatyou and I...

1702
02:02:03,006 --> 02:02:05,091
"Taken it for granted"?

1703
02:02:05,174 --> 02:02:07,260
"That you and I..."?

1704
02:02:12,306 --> 02:02:15,517
Now remember, as long as you live,
never to laugh at me.

1705
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:18,603
At anything or anyone else, but never at me.

1706
02:02:22,065 --> 02:02:26,027
- Get out.
- You're too short for that gesture.

1707
02:02:26,110 --> 02:02:28,612
Besides, it went out with Mrs Fiske.

1708
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:32,908
Then if you won't get out,
I'll have you thrown out.

1709
02:02:32,991 --> 02:02:35,994
Don't pick up that phone. Don't even touch it.

1710
02:02:36,078 --> 02:02:38,580
Something told you to do
what I said, didn't it?

1711
02:02:38,663 --> 02:02:42,500
That instinct is worth millions.
You can't buy it, Eve. Cherish it.

1712
02:02:42,584 --> 02:02:46,045
When that alarm goes off,
go to your battle stations.

1713
02:02:47,254 --> 02:02:51,925
To begin with, your name is not Eve
Harrington. It's Gertrude Slescynski.

1714
02:02:52,009 --> 02:02:55,846
- What of it?
- True, your parents were poor, and still are.

1715
02:02:55,929 --> 02:03:00,683
They would like to know how you are. They
haven't heard from you for three years.

1716
02:03:00,767 --> 02:03:02,852
What of it?

1717
02:03:03,519 --> 02:03:05,646
A matter of opinion, granted.

1718
02:03:05,730 --> 02:03:11,944
It's also true you worked in a brewery. But
life there was not as dull as you pictured it.

1719
02:03:12,027 --> 02:03:16,865
It got less and less dull, until your boss's
wife had your boss followed by detectives.

1720
02:03:16,948 --> 02:03:20,869
- She never proved a thing!
- But the $500 you got to get out of town

1721
02:03:20,952 --> 02:03:24,205
brought you straight to New York, didn't it?

1722
02:03:32,504 --> 02:03:37,134
- That $500 broughtyou straight to New York.
- She was a liar. She was a liar!

1723
02:03:37,217 --> 02:03:40,887
Answer my question.
Weren't you paid to get out of town?

1724
02:03:44,182 --> 02:03:47,810
There was no Eddie, no pilot.
You've never been married.

1725
02:03:47,893 --> 02:03:52,856
That was not only a lie, it was an insult to
dead heroes and the women who loved them.

1726
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:57,194
San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre.
You've never been to San Francisco.

1727
02:03:57,277 --> 02:04:00,947
That was a stupid lie, easy to expose,
not worthy of you.

1728
02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:06,160
I had to get in to meet Margo. I had to say
something, be somebody. Make her like me!

1729
02:04:06,244 --> 02:04:08,579
She did like you. She helped and trusted you.

1730
02:04:08,662 --> 02:04:11,623
- You repaid her by trying to win Bill.
- That's not true!

1731
02:04:11,707 --> 02:04:15,877
I was there. I saw you and heard you
through the dressing-room door.

1732
02:04:16,670 --> 02:04:20,340
You used my name to blackmail Karen
into getting you the part of Cora.

1733
02:04:20,423 --> 02:04:23,509
- You lied to me about it.
- No!

1734
02:04:23,718 --> 02:04:26,470
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago.

1735
02:04:26,554 --> 02:04:31,517
As always with women who try to find out
things, she told more than she learnt.

1736
02:04:32,309 --> 02:04:36,605
Now do you want to change your story about
Lloyd beating atyour door that night?

1737
02:04:36,688 --> 02:04:38,565
Please, please.

1738
02:04:43,111 --> 02:04:48,324
That I should wantyou at all suddenly
strikes me as the height of improbability.

1739
02:04:48,407 --> 02:04:52,036
But that in itself is probably the reason.

1740
02:04:52,119 --> 02:04:56,998
You're an improbable person, Eve,
and so am I. We have that in common.

1741
02:04:57,082 --> 02:05:01,377
Also a contempt for humanity,
an inability to love and be loved.

1742
02:05:01,461 --> 02:05:05,256
Insatiable ambition... and talent.

1743
02:05:05,339 --> 02:05:08,801
We deserve each other.
Are you listening to me?

1744
02:05:11,095 --> 02:05:14,014
- Then say so.
- Yes, Addison.

1745
02:05:14,306 --> 02:05:18,351
And you realise and you agree
how completely you belong to me?

1746
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,437
Yes, Addison.

1747
02:05:21,062 --> 02:05:24,440
Then take your nap,
and good luck for tonight.

1748
02:05:29,612 --> 02:05:31,655
I won't play tonight.

1749
02:05:31,739 --> 02:05:36,368
I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on.

1750
02:05:36,451 --> 02:05:40,663
"Couldn't go on"?
You'll give the performance of your life.

1751
02:05:59,347 --> 02:06:02,392
And she gave the performance of her life.

1752
02:06:02,475 --> 02:06:05,186
And it was a night to remember, that night.

1753
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:18,448
Honoured members of
the Sarah Siddons Society,

1754
02:06:18,531 --> 02:06:21,993
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

1755
02:06:23,286 --> 02:06:25,746
What is there for me to say?

1756
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:29,291
Everything wise and witty
has long since been said

1757
02:06:29,375 --> 02:06:33,837
by minds more mature
and talents far greater than mine.

1758
02:06:33,921 --> 02:06:37,424
For me to thank you as equals
would be presumptuous.

1759
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:40,010
I am an apprentice in the theatre,

1760
02:06:40,093 --> 02:06:43,221
and have much to learn from all of you.

1761
02:06:43,304 --> 02:06:46,974
Let me say only that I am proud and happy,

1762
02:06:47,933 --> 02:06:50,978
and that I regard this great honour

1763
02:06:51,061 --> 02:06:54,273
not so much as an award
for what I have achieved,

1764
02:06:54,356 --> 02:06:58,610
but as a standard to hold against
what I have yet to accomplish.

1765
02:07:00,028 --> 02:07:05,032
And, further, that I regard it
as bestowed upon me only in part.

1766
02:07:06,158 --> 02:07:10,704
The larger share belongs
to my friends in the theatre,

1767
02:07:10,788 --> 02:07:13,373
and to the theatre itself

1768
02:07:13,457 --> 02:07:16,376
which has given me all I have.

1769
02:07:17,794 --> 02:07:21,965
In good conscience,
I must give credit where credit is due.

1770
02:07:23,466 --> 02:07:27,094
To Max Fabian. Dear Max.

1771
02:07:27,595 --> 02:07:31,765
Dear sentimental, generous,
courageous Max Fabian,

1772
02:07:31,849 --> 02:07:35,727
who took a chance on
an unknown, untried amateur.

1773
02:07:40,398 --> 02:07:43,985
To my first friend in the theatre,

1774
02:07:44,068 --> 02:07:47,988
whose kindness and graciousness
I shall never forget,

1775
02:07:48,072 --> 02:07:50,574
Karen. Mrs Lloyd Richards.

1776
02:07:56,747 --> 02:08:00,708
It was Karen who first brought me
to one whom I'd always idolised,

1777
02:08:00,792 --> 02:08:04,128
one who became
my benefactress and champion.

1778
02:08:05,338 --> 02:08:09,175
A great actress and a great woman,

1779
02:08:09,592 --> 02:08:11,719
Margo Channing.

1780
02:08:16,556 --> 02:08:18,975
To my director,

1781
02:08:19,059 --> 02:08:24,022
who demanded always a little more
than my talent could provide,

1782
02:08:24,105 --> 02:08:26,816
but who taught me patiently and well,

1783
02:08:28,442 --> 02:08:30,527
Bill Sampson.

1784
02:08:33,322 --> 02:08:37,409
And one without whose
great play and faith in me,

1785
02:08:38,118 --> 02:08:40,912
this night could never have been.

1786
02:08:40,995 --> 02:08:43,456
How can I repay Lloyd Richards?

1787
02:08:46,292 --> 02:08:48,627
How can I repay the many others,

1788
02:08:48,711 --> 02:08:51,797
so many, I couldn't possibly name them all,

1789
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:54,967
whose help, guidance, and advice

1790
02:08:56,510 --> 02:09:01,639
have made this, the happiest
night of my life, possible.

1791
02:09:06,018 --> 02:09:10,064
Although I am going to Hollywood
next weekto make a film,

1792
02:09:10,147 --> 02:09:13,442
do not think for a moment
that I am leaving you.

1793
02:09:13,525 --> 02:09:15,736
How could I?

1794
02:09:15,819 --> 02:09:18,655
My heart is here in the theatre,

1795
02:09:18,738 --> 02:09:23,242
and 3,000 miles are too far
to be away from one's heart.

1796
02:09:23,326 --> 02:09:26,329
I'll be backto claim it... and soon.

1797
02:09:28,039 --> 02:09:31,959
That is, if you want me back.

1798
02:09:38,506 --> 02:09:41,718
Good night to you all,
and to all, a good night.

1799
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:53,812
For services rendered beyond...
whatever it is of duty, darling.

1800
02:09:58,608 --> 02:10:03,905
Come on, I'm the host. I got to get home
before my guests start stealing the liquor.

1801
02:10:06,657 --> 02:10:09,535
- Congratulations, Eve.
- Thank you, Karen.

1802
02:10:13,038 --> 02:10:17,000
- Congratulations, Miss Harrington.
- Thank you so much.

1803
02:10:17,667 --> 02:10:22,463
Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry
too much aboutyour heart.

1804
02:10:22,547 --> 02:10:26,300
You can always put that award
where your heart ought to be.

1805
02:10:28,803 --> 02:10:30,888
I don't suppose there's a drink left?

1806
02:10:30,971 --> 02:10:33,765
- You can have one at Max's.
- I don't think I'm going.

1807
02:10:33,849 --> 02:10:37,894
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

1808
02:10:37,978 --> 02:10:41,564
- I'm so happy for you, Eve.
- Thank you so much.

1809
02:10:43,024 --> 02:10:48,112
Max has gone to a lot of trouble. This is going
to be an elaborate party and it's for you.

1810
02:10:48,195 --> 02:10:51,740
No, it isn't. It's for this.

1811
02:10:51,824 --> 02:10:54,534
- It's the same thing, isn't it?
- Exactly.

1812
02:10:55,827 --> 02:10:58,705
Here, take it to the party instead of me.

1813
02:10:58,788 --> 02:11:01,040
You're being very childish.

1814
02:11:01,124 --> 02:11:05,336
- I'm tired. I want to go home.
- Very well. I'll drop you off.

1815
02:11:05,419 --> 02:11:09,048
I shall go to the party alone.
I have no intention of missing it.

1816
02:12:35,585 --> 02:12:37,712
- Who are you?
- Miss Harrington.

1817
02:12:37,796 --> 02:12:41,591
- What are you doing here?
- I... I guess I fell asleep.

1818
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:48,806
Please don't have me arrested.
I didn't steal anything. You can search me.

1819
02:12:48,889 --> 02:12:52,851
- How did you get in here?
- I hid outside till the maid came in.

1820
02:12:52,935 --> 02:12:55,771
She went out to get something
and left the door open.

1821
02:12:55,854 --> 02:12:59,941
I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished.
Then I just looked around.

1822
02:13:00,025 --> 02:13:03,778
I was afraid someone would notice
the lights were on, so I turned them off.

1823
02:13:03,861 --> 02:13:07,448
- Then I guess I fell asleep.
- You were just looking around?

1824
02:13:07,531 --> 02:13:09,450
- That's all.
- What for?

1825
02:13:09,533 --> 02:13:12,202
- You probably won't believe me.
- Probably not.

1826
02:13:12,286 --> 02:13:14,746
- It was for my report.
- What report? To whom?

1827
02:13:14,830 --> 02:13:17,707
About how you live,
what kind of clothes you wear,

1828
02:13:17,791 --> 02:13:21,920
what kind of perfume
and books, things like that.

1829
02:13:22,003 --> 02:13:26,048
You knowthe Eve Harrington Club that
they have in most girls' high schools?

1830
02:13:26,132 --> 02:13:30,135
- I've heard of them.
- Ours was one of the first - Erasmus Hall.

1831
02:13:30,219 --> 02:13:34,514
- I'm the president.
- Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?

1832
02:13:34,598 --> 02:13:39,019
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn.
Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward.

1833
02:13:39,102 --> 02:13:41,521
Of course, they're just movie stars.

1834
02:13:41,604 --> 02:13:44,273
You're going to Hollywood, aren'tyou?

1835
02:13:45,733 --> 02:13:49,361
From the trunks you're packing,
you must be going to stay a long time.

1836
02:13:49,445 --> 02:13:51,530
I might.

1837
02:13:55,534 --> 02:13:58,453
That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet.

1838
02:13:58,536 --> 02:14:01,039
Maid'll fix it in the morning.

1839
02:14:01,956 --> 02:14:04,876
- I'll just clean up the mess.
- Don't bother.

1840
02:14:05,751 --> 02:14:08,796
- How'd you get up here from Brooklyn?
- Subway.

1841
02:14:09,922 --> 02:14:12,174
How long does it take?

1842
02:14:12,257 --> 02:14:15,177
With changing and everything,
a little over an hour.

1843
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:18,930
It's after one now.
You won't get home till all hours.

1844
02:14:20,765 --> 02:14:22,850
I don't care if I never get home.

1845
02:14:25,186 --> 02:14:27,271
That's the door.

1846
02:14:30,357 --> 02:14:32,443
You rest. I'll get it.

1847
02:14:40,617 --> 02:14:42,910
Hello. Who are you?

1848
02:14:43,745 --> 02:14:47,790
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr DeWitt.
She asked me to see who it is.

1849
02:14:47,873 --> 02:14:49,959
Well, we won't disturb her rest.

1850
02:14:50,042 --> 02:14:55,172
It seems Miss Harrington left her award
in the taxi cab. Will you give it to her?

1851
02:14:56,465 --> 02:14:59,426
Tell me, how did you know my name?

1852
02:15:00,218 --> 02:15:02,929
It's a very famous name, Mr DeWitt.

1853
02:15:03,012 --> 02:15:05,431
- And what's your name?
- Phoebe.

1854
02:15:06,098 --> 02:15:09,101
- Phoebe?
- I call myself Phoebe.

1855
02:15:10,477 --> 02:15:12,354
And why not?

1856
02:15:12,438 --> 02:15:17,776
Tell me, Phoebe, do you want someday
to have an award like that of your own?

1857
02:15:17,859 --> 02:15:23,281
- More than anything else in the world.
- Then ask Miss Harrington howto get one.

1858
02:15:24,449 --> 02:15:27,368
Miss Harrington knows all about it.

1859
02:15:35,917 --> 02:15:38,086
Who was it?

1860
02:15:38,169 --> 02:15:40,338
Just a taxi driver, Miss Harrington.

1861
02:15:40,422 --> 02:15:44,300
You leftyour award in his cab,
and he brought it back.

1862
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:48,429
Put it on one of the trunks,
will you? I wanna pack it.

1863
02:15:48,512 --> 02:15:50,598
Sure, Miss Harrington.
