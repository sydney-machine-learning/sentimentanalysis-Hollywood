1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>This is Providence...</i>

2
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:46,064
<i>Providence, Rhode Island,</i>
<i>where we lived in the year 1921.</i>

3
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,134
<i>I was 16 then</i>
<i>and a sophomore in high school.</i>

4
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:52,147
<i>But enough about me,</i>
<i>for this is not my story...</i>

5
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:55,708
<i>but the story of our family</i>
<i>and, first and foremost...</i>

6
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:59,383
<i>the story of my father</i>
<i>and my mother.</i>

7
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,055
<i>Dad... Frank Bunker Gilbreth...</i>
<i>was an industrial engineer...</i>

8
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,860
<i>and a leader in the field</i>
<i>of scientific management.</i>

9
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:09,563
<i>If that sounds complicated, just say
that he was an efficiency expert...</i>

10
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:12,835
<i>a man who'd shown industry</i>
<i>how to save time.</i>

11
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:15,070
<i>He was a man</i>
<i>of definite character...</i>

12
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:19,913
<i>and once his course was set,</i>
<i>nothing could swerve him.</i>

13
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:22,579
Road hog!

14
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:31,493
<i>Whenever he came home
from a business trip...</i>

15
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:34,296
<i>even if he'd been away only for a day,</i>

16
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:37,135
<i>He brought with him an element</i>
<i>of surprise and suspense.</i>

17
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:40,666
<i>For there's no doubt about it.</i>
<i>Dad was a rugged individualist...</i>

18
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,476
<i>Brilliant but... well, let's face it...</i>
<i>a trifle eccentric,</i>

19
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:47,040
<i>Living by a code</i>
<i>of his own design.</i>

20
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,351
<i>It's Daddy! It's Daddy!</i>

21
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:25,959
Hello, live bait.

22
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:28,529
- Hello, Dad. Glad you're home.
- Glad to be home, Anne.

23
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:31,576
- Hi, Dad. I was over on the lot.
- Hmm. So I see.

24
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:35,740
Eighteen seconds. Not bad, not bad.
But I still say we should make it in less.

25
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,750
<i>- We gotta keep trying.</i>
- Hello, Frank.

26
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,752
- Hello, dear.
- How was your trip?

27
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,755
- Couldn't have been better.
- I'm glad, dear.

28
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,793
Hi, there, funny face. Have any
trouble with the offspring this time?

29
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,852
- No more than usual.
- How about this one?

30
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,421
- Oh, she's been good as gold.
<i>- Hey, Dad...</i>

31
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,867
what did you bring us?

32
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,996
Quiet, quiet.
You'll find out later.

33
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:58,443
Fall in. Fall in.
Come on, there, small fry.

34
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,810
Mm-hmm.

35
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:14,196
Good boy, Jackie.

36
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:16,928
Dan.

37
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:18,938
You, there.
What's your name... Sitting Bull?

38
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:22,567
Aw, you haven't forgotten me, Daddy.
I'm Fred.

39
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:24,908
- Fred? Fred what?
- Fred Sittin Bull.

40
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:26,913
- How!
- How!

41
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:31,682
All right, let's see your nails.

42
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:36,250
Hmm, you could stand a little soap
and water on those hands, young man.

43
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:40,458
Aw, heck, Dad. What's the good of always
washing 'em? They only get dirty again.

44
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:43,366
That's a risk we have to take.

45
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:46,216
Lillian, I thought I told
you not to bite your nails.

46
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:49,193
I didn't bite 'em, Daddy.
They broke off on the piano.

47
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,310
Then maybe you'd better
go back to the violin.

48
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,943
- Oh-oh. How many home runs today?
- Two.

49
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:59,284
Slipping, huh?

50
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:01,291
All right, Martha.
Still dieting?

51
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,486
Kinda.

52
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:07,727
Very nice, Mary. Ernestine.

53
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:11,397
Mm-hmm.

54
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,407
What's that on your face? Paint?

55
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:17,242
No, it isn't. And besides, Dad, they don't
call it paint anymore. It's makeup.

56
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:20,715
I don't care what they call it.
And don't think you can fool me, either.

57
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:22,912
I know paint when I see it.

58
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:26,686
Here. Spit on this.

59
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,464
Hm. Well, I see it isn't paint,
and I apologize.

60
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,652
But it might have been.

61
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:38,880
As I've told you, I won't have
any painted women in this house.

62
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:40,825
If you start any of that nonsense,

63
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:42,686
- you'll find yourself...
- In a convent.

64
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,582
Yes, Daddy, I know... the one with
the 12-foot wall, near Albany.

65
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:47,280
Don't be impertinent.

66
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:55,388
Now, you'll find the chocolate bars
there in my briefcase. Fall out. Fall out.

67
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:56,994
Well, Lillie, it's all settled.

68
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:57,949
Is it, dear?

69
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,733
Yes, ma'am... signed, sealed
and ready for delivery.

70
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:01,382
Good.

71
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,000
- What is? What is?
- What's ready for delivery, Dad?

72
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,337
- Shall I?
- They'll have to know sooner or later.

73
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,438
All right. Hey, small fry, how would you
kids like to live in Montclair, New Jersey?

74
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:13,486
- Montclair?
- You mean leave Providence?

75
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:16,522
- I don't know how else you'd do it.
- Oh, but why? Why?

76
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,115
- Well, because it'd be nearer my work.
- But, gee, Dad.

77
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,843
- I'm shortstop on our team.
- And I'm pitcher.

78
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:24,000
There's plenty of time
before school starts.

79
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,556
You can form a new
team in Montclair.

80
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,197
But we don't wanna
form a new team.

81
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:29,032
We wanna be on the one we're on.

82
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:31,314
Who wants to live in Montclair?

83
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,699
You promised when we moved
here we could stay.

84
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:36,936
- Just when we were making friends too.
- It's all right now, lady.

85
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:40,550
I got them marbles and the comb out,
and I think most of the bird's nest.

86
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,647
- Anyway, it works just as good as ever.
- I'll send you a check.

87
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:46,433
- That's all right, you just sign here.
- Aw, Dad, please...

88
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,759
Be quiet, all of you!

89
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,827
Stop this infernal howling.

90
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:55,395
- But Dad...
- Stop it!

91
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:58,128
All these kids yours, mister?
Or is this a picnic?

92
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:01,739
They're all mine, and believe me,
it's no picnic.

93
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:03,806
- Aw, look...
- Silence!

94
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,380
<i>After a few days of organized confusion...</i>

95
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:10,447
<i>we were packed</i>
<i>and ready to depart.</i>

96
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:14,156
<i>And I might add that</i>
<i>Ringling Brothers' Circus had nothing on us.</i>

97
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:16,723
- Hurry up there, Frank.
- Get off my feet!

98
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:20,238
Be sure everything's out of the house
before you leave, Jim.

99
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,865
Don't you worry, Mrs. Gilbreth.
We'll take care of everything.

100
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:25,172
Have a nice trip.
We'll see you Friday morning.

101
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,739
Yes, we'll meet the train.

102
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,751
Hey, Bill. Come on, there.
Hurry up.

103
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,975
Come on. Foolish Carriage
is getting restless.

104
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:33,898
I'm comin, Dad.

105
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:35,892
Come on, Bill. Make it snappy.

106
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,124
- Mercy Maud!
- Scared you, didn't I, son?

107
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:41,390
Mercy Maud!

108
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,682
I'll bet you jumped
six and 9/10ths inches.

109
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,670
- Gee, Dad.
- It's all right, dear.

110
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:49,004
Teach you to keep your eyes open
crossing streets, young man.

111
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:52,011
Well, is everybody in?
Anne, Ernestine, Martha, Mary, Frank...

112
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,105
- All present and accounted for, Dad.
- Okay.

113
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,344
If you're all reasonably sanitary,
let's go.

114
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:59,354
Bye, Jim! Bye, Mrs. Monahan!

115
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:02,220
- Good-bye! Good-bye!
- Good-bye, Rhode Island.

116
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:04,182
New Jersey, here we come.

117
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:15,501
Hey, Noah, what are you doin
with that ark?

118
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:18,012
Collecting animals
like the good Lord told me, brother.

119
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,311
All I need now
is a jackass. Hop in!

120
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:27,519
- We turn to the left here, don't we, dear?
- I'm going to turn.

121
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:30,563
It's okay, Dad. I think you can make it.

122
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,431
I know I can make it. Hold out your hand.

123
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:36,435
<i>- Hi, brother.</i>
- Hi, brother.

124
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:40,463
Hi!

125
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:54,788
Eh, that fan belt again.
You have to get out, Bill.

126
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,853
- Excuse me, Lillie.
- It's not going to blow up, is it?

127
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:00,423
Of course not.
Won't take a minute to fix it.

128
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:01,812
Incidentally, now's a good time,

129
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:05,021
while we're stopped, if any of
you want to go see Mrs. Murphy.

130
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:07,008
- Well, how about it?
- Not me, Dad.

131
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:11,208
All right. But remember, all of you,
this is your last chance.

132
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:15,014
Can't understand why a good car
like this should keep acting up.

133
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:19,080
If it's not one thing, it's another.
Last week it was the carburetor.

134
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:36,840
- Who did that?
- Uh, that was a good joke on you, Dad.

135
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,051
Listen, young man...

136
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:44,079
there's a time and a place for jokes,
and a time and a place for spankings.

137
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:46,787
And the sooner you learn...
Get out. Get out.

138
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:52,265
Mercy Maud, Frank. I'll bet you jumped
six and 9/10ths inches that time.

139
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:57,540
Ha, you're right, son.

140
00:09:57,608 --> 00:10:02,741
That <i>was</i> a good joke on me. By jingo,
I'll bet I did jump six and 9/10ths inches.

141
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:08,084
Oh, these kids. These kids.

142
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:14,418
Oh, excuse me, dear. I did that.
It was accidental.

143
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:25,165
~ You made life cheery
when you called me dearie ~

144
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:29,188
~ 'Twas down where
the bluegrass grows ~

145
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:31,857
~ Your lips were sweeter
than julep ~

146
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,091
~ When you wore a tulip ~

147
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:38,360
- ~And I wore a big, red rose ~
- ~ Bom, bom ~~

148
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:42,556
Ah, Lillie, what do you suppose
piddling little families...

149
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:45,401
with only five or six
children do with themselves?

150
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:47,447
I can't imagine. But
I do know one thing.

151
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:50,782
We'll look back on moments like
these as the happiest in our lives.

152
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,761
- You children hear that?
- Yes, sir.

153
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:54,762
All right. Don't forget it.

154
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:58,261
- ~ Memories, memories ~
- ~ Memories ~

155
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,953
Dad. Hey, Dad.

156
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,320
- Yes, son?
- I gotta go see Mrs. Murphy.

157
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,829
I asked you not 15 minutes
ago, and you said that you...

158
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,526
Yes, I know... but, gee,
I can't help it, Dad.

159
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:10,526
- Me too, Dad.
- I do too, Dad.

160
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:13,456
By jingo, I gave you your last chance.
I'm not stopping again.

161
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:15,865
- But, Dad...
- Nothing doing. You had every opportunity.

162
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,277
Frank, I think
you'd better stop.

163
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,492
All right. Out you go.

164
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,920
And hurry up.
We haven't got all day!

165
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,480
Make it snappy.

166
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:48,788
All right. You can open your eyes now.

167
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:51,082
Well, what do you think of it?

168
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:53,261
- Oh, Frank, it's beautiful.
- It's wonderful, Dad.

169
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:57,110
I'm glad you like it. Wait till you see
the inside. Come on. Let's get out.

170
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,856
Come on there, Frank.
Help your mother.

171
00:11:58,882 --> 00:11:59,974
That's a good fella.

172
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:02,431
You must admit it's a mighty
fine piece of property.

173
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:03,508
It's lovely.

174
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:06,053
I knew it was the right place
the minute I laid eyes on it.

175
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:10,075
I didn't say much or try to describe it.
I didn't want you to be disappointed.

176
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:12,779
- Oh, no, Daddy. We love it.
- Howdy. You folks moving in here?

177
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:15,643
- That's right. Gilbreth's the name.
- You certainly got a nice place.

178
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,926
- I'll say that for you.
- Thank you. We think so.

179
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:20,227
- All those kids yours?
- Oh, these aren't so many.

180
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:22,843
You ought to see the ones
we left behind.

181
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,201
How you ever feed 'em?

182
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,862
Ah, they come cheaper by
the dozen, you know.

183
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:29,048
Come on, kids.

184
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:38,516
<i>It</i> was <i>a wonderful house,</i>
<i>and we loved living in it...</i>

185
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:42,503
<i>but we soon found out that, while it
was often too small for 12 children...</i>

186
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:45,605
<i>it was more often too large</i>
<i>for two servants.</i>

187
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:51,289
<i>As usual, Mother and Dad met their problem</i>
<i>in the typical Gilbreth manner... head on!</i>

188
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,811
The family council
will please come to order.

189
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:01,486
Now, obviously, this house is too big
for Mrs. Monahan and Jim Bracken...

190
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,797
to take care of without help.

191
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:06,708
Therefore, your mother and I have
called this meeting to discuss...

192
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:10,516
you children taking over part of the work
in the house and in the yard.

193
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,194
Assignments will be made on the basis
of personal choice and aptitude.

194
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,408
Now, does the chair hear
any suggestions?

195
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:23,290
Come, come, members of the council, this is
a democracy. Everybody has an equal voice.

196
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:25,356
How do you want
to divide the work?

197
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:31,740
In a democracy, everybody speaks.
So, by jingo, start speaking.

198
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:34,886
Bill, I recognize you.
What do you think?

199
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:39,203
I think Mrs. Monahan and Jim Bracken
ought to do the work. They get paid for it.

200
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,943
- Sit down. You're no longer recognized.
- But in a democracy...

201
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:45,458
Hush, Bill. It's almost impossible
to get good servants...

202
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,828
these days with so many
children in the family.

203
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:49,763
- Mr. Chairman?
<i>- Yes, son?</i>

204
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,052
I think you're right.

205
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:53,804
Jim and Mrs. Monahan do
have too much to do.

206
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:56,364
I move we hire more
people to work for us.

207
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,978
- Second the motion!
- Me too.

208
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:01,267
Out of order. Sit down and
be quiet, all of you.

209
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:04,367
I, uh... Uh,

210
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:08,354
The chair recognizes
the assistant chairman.

211
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:12,493
Well, of course, we could hire additional
help, and that might be the answer.

212
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,276
But that would mean cutting
the budget somewhere else.

213
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,288
Perhaps if we cut out
all desserts...

214
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:22,387
<i>and allowances,</i>
<i>we might be able to afford a maid.</i>

215
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:26,739
<i>And then if we cut out movies, ice cream
sodas and new clothes for a year...</i>

216
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,478
we might even be able to afford
a helper for Jim too.

217
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:32,926
Uh-huh. Do I hear a motion
to that effect?

218
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:36,370
How about it, Bill?
You want to stop allowances? Frank? Anne?

219
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,418
Oh, well.
I move we allot the work.

220
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:43,950
- Splendid, splendid. Do I hear a second?
- Second the motion.

221
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,936
- All those in favor signify.
- Aye.

222
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:49,879
Motion carried.
Now, is there any further business?

223
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:51,942
I move we adjourn.

224
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,089
Not so fast, young lady. There's still
that little matter of specific assignments.

225
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:59,630
For instance, the back fence,
which is badly in need of whitewashing.

226
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:01,646
Do I hear any bids?

227
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:05,956
Huh? Speak up. If you want to earn a little
extra spending money, here's your chance.

228
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:08,592
- Yes, Bill?
- I'll bid $10.

229
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:13,046
You must think this is a government
project. Do I hear any reasonable bids?

230
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:15,715
I... I bid 47 cents.

231
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,564
- Forty-seven cents?
- Please, Daddy. Let me do it.

232
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:23,632
Tell me, how do you happen
to hit on 47 cents?

233
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:27,228
I've been saving to buy a pair of roller
skates, and that's how much more I need.

234
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:29,136
But you're gonna get
skates for your birthday.

235
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:29,984
Frank.

236
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,841
Oh, I'm sorry, Lillie. I wasn't
supposed to let that out of the bag.

237
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:37,409
Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.
Thank you, thank you.

238
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:40,464
Besides, that's too big a job
for a little girl like you.

239
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:45,370
Frank, here's your chance.
What do you bid... within reason?

240
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:48,717
Oh, well. 2.50, I guess.

241
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:52,994
Good. You got yourself a contract.
Now, is there any more new business?

242
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:57,404
I think this family
ought to buy a dog.

243
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:59,977
Out of order. Meeting adjourned.

244
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:12,213
Well, here we are.
I know you're all eager to get started...

245
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:14,374
on a new school year, so out you go.

246
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,937
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- But, Dad, not all of us?

247
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:19,881
Certainly all of you. You want us
to make an impression, don't you?

248
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:21,969
But this isn't our school...
Ernestine's and mine.

249
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:24,410
- We're gonna go to high school.
- We'll take care of that later.

250
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:27,017
I wanna show these people first
what a rea lfamily looks like.

251
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,633
But it's so embarrassing.

252
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,406
A person with inner dignity
is never embarrassed.

253
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:34,723
Besides, visits like this get results.
Teachers lap it up.

254
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:37,903
I only wish I had time to send home
for your mother and the babies.

255
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:40,583
And I will, too, unless you
two get a move-on. Come on.

256
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:41,693
Honestly, Dad.

257
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:43,199
You have more gall...

258
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:45,892
Somebody in this family has
to show a little spunk.

259
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:47,964
- Come on, son.
- It's so silly.

260
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:53,918
Ern! Ern!

261
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,428
There he is.

262
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,560
He's the one I told you about, the
captain of the swimming team.

263
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:06,149
His name is Tom Black.

264
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:09,565
- Oh, he's adorable.
- I'll say.

265
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,893
What are you two hanging back there for?
Come along!

266
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:19,986
Shh! Daddy, please. Why...

267
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,529
- Why, somebody might hear you.
- Suppose they do?

268
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:24,789
They're gonna hear from me
soon enough anyhow.

269
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:29,226
No dying-cow looks, now. Hold your
heads up and look alive. Let's go.

270
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:31,225
Take your hats off.

271
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:36,816
Gangway.

272
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:45,277
Refer these to Miss Jensen.
Give these to Miss Sweeney.

273
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,289
Come in.

274
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,663
Good morning, madam.

275
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:52,134
Just a Gilbreth invasion, or perhaps
I should say a partial invasion...

276
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,514
since I left most of them
at home with their mother.

277
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,751
- I hope we're not intruding.
- Oh, not at all.

278
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:58,565
I'm delighted to see you, Mr.
Gilbreth.

279
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,335
We've heard so much about you.
I understand you have...

280
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,978
Eleven children, ma'am,
but unfortunately...

281
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,948
only five will be under
your excellent supervision:

282
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:09,914
Mary, Martha, Lillian,
Bill and Frank Jr.

283
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:12,417
- How do you do, sir?
- I just brought my two older girls,

284
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:13,951
Anne and Ernestine along...

285
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:16,510
so you could get a better
idea of the crop we're raising.

286
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:18,753
Well, I'm so glad
you dropped in, Mr. Gilbreth.

287
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,404
I'm sure we're all going to get
along beautifully together.

288
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,494
It's such a pleasure...

289
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:24,658
Uh, just a minute.
I'm not just dropping in.

290
00:18:24,684 --> 00:18:27,574
I want to meet their teachers and
see what grades they're going into.

291
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,998
Well, I'm afraid all our teachers are busy
at the moment. You see, it's opening day...

292
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:32,983
Oh, that's all right.
I'm in no hurry.

293
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:36,440
In fact, I've arranged my schedule
so as to give you my entire morning.

294
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,896
- You have?
- Meanwhile, as to their grades...

295
00:18:38,922 --> 00:18:41,919
I see no reason why children who
are well-developed mentally

296
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:44,124
should be held back...
by a school system

297
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,885
geared to those of simply
normal intelligence.

298
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:50,699
No. Of course not. But so much depends
on their ages. Now, if you'll just...

299
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,100
You mean mental ages, of course.

300
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:57,034
- Bill, how old are you, son?
- Eight.

301
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,505
What grade does an eight-year-old
usually belong in?

302
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:02,230
- The third.
- Then I think he'd better go in the fifth.

303
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:06,856
Oh-ho, but that's impossible, Mr. Gilbreth.
Perhaps later on, if he takes tests...

304
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:11,330
By all means. I hope they'll all take
a lot of tests. It's good for them.

305
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:14,885
Meanwhile to, uh,
to illustrate my point... Frank...

306
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:18,623
what's 46 times 83?

307
00:19:18,697 --> 00:19:21,184
Three thousand,
eight hundred and eighteen.

308
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:24,657
Lillian, 19 times 91.

309
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:27,557
<i>One thousand,</i>
<i>seven hundred and twenty-nine.</i>

310
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:32,250
Bill, 52 times 52.

311
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:34,552
Two thousand,
seven hundred and four.

312
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,987
Now, would you care to suggest
a few large numbers?

313
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:42,546
Well, I... think I'll take your
word for it, Mr. Gilbreth...

314
00:19:42,622 --> 00:19:44,554
and I'll see what I can do.

315
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,206
It would really
expedite matters...

316
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:49,178
if you'd have the teacher of the fifth
grade step in here for a moment.

317
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:50,951
Also, while we're about it...

318
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:55,008
the teachers of the third,
fourth, sixth and seventh.

319
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,728
Ask Miss Billsop, Miss Jensen,
Miss Moore, Mrs. Hallbright...

320
00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:59,948
and Miss Sweeney
to step in here for a moment.

321
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:01,343
- Yes, ma'am.
<i>- Thank you, madam.</i>

322
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:02,784
And now, while we're waiting...

323
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:05,805
perhaps it might interest you to hear
something of the home training program...

324
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:08,110
their mother and I have
worked out for the children:

325
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:11,010
Spelling games, geography
quizzes, language study...

326
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,840
We're learning French and
German from a Victrola.

327
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,059
Dad's even taught us how
to take a whole bath

328
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:18,232
in the time it takes to
play just one record.

329
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:21,505
- Really?
- A simple matter of coordination, madam.

330
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:24,120
Like any other physical effort,
scientific bathing is...

331
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:25,726
Yes, but how do you do it?

332
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:28,728
Well, this seems hardly
the time and place.

333
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:31,969
I doubt if you'd be interested.

334
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:35,132
Oh, but I am. It sounds
perfectly fascinating.

335
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,779
- Yeah. Go on. Show her, Dad.
- Yeah. Show her.

336
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:41,930
Well, if you insist, son.
This is really very simple.

337
00:20:42,004 --> 00:20:45,367
First, you take the soap in your right
hand, apply it to the left shoulder...

338
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:50,493
run it down the top of the left arm, up the
inside of the left arm to the armpit...

339
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:54,794
<i>then the ears... both of them, of course...</i>
<i>not forgetting the back of the neck...</i>

340
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:58,821
then down the outside of the left leg,
back up the inside of the left leg...

341
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:01,364
then down the right leg, and up.

342
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,758
Then at the hip,
change the soap to the left hand...

343
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:07,018
<i>and do the same thing</i>
<i>on the right arm and shoulder.</i>

344
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:10,358
<i>After a couple of circular motions</i>
<i>on the midsection and back...</i>

345
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,520
and some special attention
to the feet...

346
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:17,492
slide under for a rinse,
and you rise bathed.

347
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:21,516
Oh, come in, ladies. Mr. Gilbreth
is just showing me how to take a bath.

348
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:24,649
- A what?
- Good morning, ladies.

349
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:26,713
 Good morning.

350
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,425
<i>In our family, sickness was taboo.</i>

351
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:34,196
<i>Dr. Burton's car in front of our house</i>
<i>could mean only one thing.</i>

352
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:36,204
<i>- Dad!</i>
- Yes?

353
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:37,956
Where's the baby? Where is it?

354
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:40,733
In her room taking her
nap, of course. Why?

355
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:43,973
- We mean the latest model.
- Is it a boy or a girl?

356
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,980
Is what a boy or a girl?

357
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:49,540
Aw, come on, Daddy. You can't fool us.
What are we gonna name this one?

358
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:52,355
Lillie, what's got into these children?
What are they talking about?

359
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:55,690
- I can't imagine, dear.
- We wanna see the new baby.

360
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,250
Whatever gave you the idea
there was a new baby?

361
00:21:58,328 --> 00:22:00,986
That's Dr. Burton's
automobile outside, isn't it?

362
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:01,821
Yes.

363
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:05,357
- And you were sick last night, weren't ya?
- I had a slight headache.

364
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:07,999
And every time you're sick
there's always a baby, isn't there?

365
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:09,914
Oh, my goodness.

366
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,076
Babies don't come just because you're sick.
I thought you knew that.

367
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:15,612
They've always come before
when you were sick.

368
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:18,315
Oh, dear.

369
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:20,975
It's up to you, Lillie.
You're the psychologist.

370
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:24,614
I have some very important work to do.
I'll be in my study.

371
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:26,714
You understand, don't you?

372
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:29,600
Yes, I certainly do.

373
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:31,806
Well, first, about Dr. Burton.

374
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:34,334
He's here because he's afraid
Jack has a whooping cough,

375
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,426
which means you children... will
have to stay away from him.

376
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:42,436
As to babies, well, I think it's
about time we had a little talk.

377
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:49,970
Oh, no, Bill. Don't tell
me you're getting it too?

378
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,053
- Who's that coughing?
<i>- Me, Dad.</i>

379
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,887
Well, stop it. I'm not gonna
have an epidemic in this house.

380
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,999
We haven't time
for any such nonsense.

381
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:06,272
You children have been given good health,
and by jingo, it's your job to keep it.

382
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:08,482
- I don't want any excuses. You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

383
00:23:08,508 --> 00:23:10,259
- All right.
- I think I better get...

384
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,655
him up to the doctor.
- Yes, Lillie.

385
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:17,467
Where did that whatever-it-is come from?

386
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:19,737
- He's a beaut, isn't he, Dad?
- A beaut?

387
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:22,713
Look here, you mangy mongrel...

388
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:25,410
Go on. Get out.
Don't argue. Out! Out!

389
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:32,824
Martha, keep that cover on.

390
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:35,087
Remember what the doctor said.

391
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:37,686
- He wants you to keep warm.
- Yes, Mother.

392
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:40,734
Here, darling.
Put this jacket around your shoulders.

393
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:42,735
Oh, thank you, Mother.

394
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:45,431
<i>I'm going down to the kitchen</i>
<i>now to get your dessert...</i>

395
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:47,564
and I'll read to you,
if you like.

396
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,575
- Oh, hello, Dad.
- May I come in?

397
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:52,636
<i>- Of course, dear.</i>
- I won't disturb anything.

398
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,773
It's all right. The
children have missed you.

399
00:23:57,918 --> 00:24:00,142
Oh, Frank. Not you too?

400
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:02,946
Yes, yes. Looks like I
belong up here too, Lillie.

401
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:05,022
Oh, dear.

402
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:07,368
Daddy's got the whooping cough.

403
00:24:07,394 --> 00:24:11,923
- Daddy's got the whooping cough.
- You children get back in bed. Go on.

404
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:14,059
- Dr. Burton...
<i>- Yes?</i>

405
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:17,002
- Will you come in here a minute, please?
<i>- Right away.</i>

406
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,166
Frank, sit down, dear.

407
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:24,286
- Do you ache anywhere?
- I'll be all right, Lillie.

408
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:26,022
In heavers name, what's
the trouble now?

409
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,482
It's Mr. Gilbreth.
He's coughing too.

410
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,645
Oh, me. How did I ever get mixed
up with this family anyhow?

411
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,915
Let me hear you cough.

412
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:36,355
There's nothin the matter with me.

413
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:38,984
- I was only joking.
- You were what?

414
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,962
Well, it just wasn't any fun
downstairs by myself, Lillie.

415
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,289
I wanted to be up here with
the rest of the family.

416
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:46,424
Very funny. Very funny.

417
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:47,764
Frank Gilbreth, I give up.

418
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:50,147
Sometimes I think you're more
trouble than the children.

419
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:53,216
I'm sorry, Lillie. But all that quiet
down there makes me nervous.

420
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,177
Oh, really.

421
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:59,414
Tell me, Doc, how are
my Mongolians coming along?

422
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:02,846
- They'll live.
- In spite of you, you old veterinarian.

423
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:06,683
Well, I'll say one thing for you, Gilbreth.
Your children don't get sick very often...

424
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:08,690
but when they do,
they certainly mess up...

425
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,089
the public health statistics
of the state of New Jersey.

426
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,591
How's that, Mr. Bones?

427
00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:15,422
Ordinarily, I only have a couple
of cases of whooping cough...

428
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,492
or measles a week, but
when I have to report

429
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,515
11 cases in a single
day, they're liable...

430
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:23,079
to quarantine the whole town of Montclair
and close every school in Essex county.

431
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,040
Well, at least these
are only light cases.

432
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,473
Pioneer stock, you know.

433
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:30,478
As far as New Jersey's concerned,
whooping cough's whooping cough.

434
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:33,276
By the way, these kids have got tonsils...
really ugly ones.

435
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:35,670
As soon as they're over this,
they ought to come out.

436
00:25:35,696 --> 00:25:37,333
I've never had mine out.

437
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,562
- Maybe you should. Let's look.
- No, you don't.

438
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:40,932
There's nothing
the matter with them.

439
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:44,451
- Oh, stop wasting my time and sit down.
- What's the point of all this?

440
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:47,190
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

441
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:50,632
- Say "ah."
- Ah-h-h-h.

442
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:53,430
Just as I thought. Yours should
have been out years ago.

443
00:25:53,503 --> 00:25:56,558
You're crazy. I've never
been sick a day in my life.

444
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:58,899
Let them stay in if you want to.

445
00:25:58,943 --> 00:26:00,877
You're not hurting
anyone but yourself.

446
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:05,177
But these children's tonsils have got
to come out, all but one... Martha's.

447
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:07,843
<i>- Hers are as sound as a dollar.</i>
- Hooray for me.

448
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,741
Well, good night, girls.
I'll see you tomorrow.

449
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,041
<i>Good night, Doctor.</i>

450
00:26:13,347 --> 00:26:15,856
Say, Doc, I was just thinking.

451
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:19,226
If we have to have their tonsils out,
could we do it here in the house?

452
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:21,315
Why here? What's the
matter with a hospital?

453
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:23,588
Well, it struck me if we
could rig up an operating

454
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:25,988
room downstairs, I could
photograph the operations...

455
00:26:26,037 --> 00:26:28,093
and study what you
doctors are doing wrong.

456
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,148
Then I'd be able to show
how you could eliminate

457
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,068
a lot of waste motions
and speed things up.

458
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:35,207
Now, wait a minute. That system of yours
may be all right in factories...

459
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,411
And in medicine too. Ho-ho, I've
been looking for a chance like this.

460
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:42,420
- Now, not so fast. Nobody's going to...
- Oh, you're leaving, Doctor?

461
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:45,179
Lillie, we're gonna have the
children's tonsils out.

462
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:46,888
Oh, Frank, do we have to?

463
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:50,329
That's what this fella here says.
But it's all right. I'm gonna take movies.

464
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:52,920
- Of the operations?
- Certainly, of the operations.

465
00:26:52,998 --> 00:26:56,263
Why, there's no telling how many lives
this sort of study will help save.

466
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:59,499
But doesn't it seem rather heartless,
using the children as guinea pigs?

467
00:26:59,572 --> 00:27:02,269
Not at all. They'll be asleep
and won't know what's going on.

468
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:04,963
Besides, if it'll make you
feel any better, I'll

469
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:07,396
let this old butcher
here yank mine out too.

470
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:11,253
Yours? Well, why didn't you say so?
Now we're getting somewhere.

471
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,087
- Oh, Frank...
- No, don't stop him. Let...

472
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:14,660
him go ahead and cut
his own throat.

473
00:27:14,686 --> 00:27:18,079
That's one part of the
festivities I might even enjoy.

474
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:21,024
Will you stop drooling?

475
00:27:21,094 --> 00:27:25,088
By jingo, this may make you famous,
you ol' quack.

476
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,367
All right, May,
you can ease up a little now.

477
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,318
All right. Start...
Start cranking.

478
00:27:46,387 --> 00:27:49,357
Can you see it all?
Is the clock in?

479
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:51,357
<i>Yeah, it's in.</i>

480
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:53,690
<i>Everything's in.</i>

481
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:57,892
Mr. Gilbreth,
my stomach's beginning to...

482
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:01,960
I'm not interested in your internal organs.
Just keep cranking.

483
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,537
<i>Dad had said, "Think of
all the fun we'll have..."</i>

484
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:09,669
<i>"looking at the movies</i>
<i>and seeing ourselves asleep."</i>

485
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:13,908
<i>"But I'm afraid, to those waiting,</i>
<i>it was not a very consoling thought."</i>

486
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,613
<i>"As much as they loved movies,</i>
<i>I have a feeling that that's one epic..."</i>

487
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:20,178
<i>"they'd have been</i>
<i>delighted to pass up."</i>

488
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:29,328
I hear you poor kids couldn't
have any breakfast this morning.

489
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:32,731
Aw, everybody knows you can't eat
before you get operated on.

490
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:36,671
I had doughnuts for breakfast with sugar...
mmm, delicious...

491
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:39,435
<i>and a big piece of apple pie</i>
<i>that was left over from last night.</i>

492
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:41,442
You beast.
You get out of here.

493
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,309
Mrs. Monahan was just as sweet
as she could be.

494
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:46,315
"Why don't you have
another one, Martha?"

495
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:48,783
"Thanks, Mrs. Monahan,
I believe I will."

496
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,446
"Why don't you take two to three, dear?
They're so tasty."

497
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,954
<i>"I really shouldn't,</i>
<i>Mrs. Monahan.</i>

498
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,892
<i>"But maybe while those poor kids</i>
<i>are waiting tonight...</i>

499
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:59,758
I'll dedicate one
to each of them."

500
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,162
<i>Mother, will you make
Martha stop talking...</i>

501
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:04,167
<i>about what a delicious</i>
<i>breakfast she had?</i>

502
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:06,532
<i>All she's done since she's
been in here is gloat.</i>

503
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,064
Not another word about food,
Martha. Do you understand?

504
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,463
I'm sorry, Mother.

505
00:29:10,508 --> 00:29:13,476
I won't even mention doughnuts
and apple pie again.

506
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:14,464
<i>Martha!</i>

507
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,700
Nothing to it. Anneslept
through it just like a baby.

508
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:21,684
And I know we got some great movies.
Come on, Ernestine, girl. You're next.

509
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:24,795
Don't be afraid, dear. It'll
be over in a few minutes.

510
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:26,977
I'm not afraid, Mother, much.

511
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:30,755
A Gilbreth, afraid? Don't be ridiculous.
After all, she's her father's daughter.

512
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:33,839
What in the world is there to be afraid of?
Never heard such nonsense.

513
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:36,366
This'll all be over in a jiffy.
Go on, dear.

514
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:37,439
Go ahead, dear.

515
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:40,303
- That's a good girl.
- I'll go up with Anne.

516
00:29:40,372 --> 00:29:42,397
Everything's under control.

517
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,970
Let's take off the robe
and hop right up here on the table.

518
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:49,741
- Is it going to hurt?
- At your age, you won't even feel it.

519
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:52,148
That's what I told her, Doctor.

520
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:54,150
All right, May.

521
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:59,314
Just relax, dear. I'll be
right here with you.

522
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:04,886
How about changing the lens
for this one?

523
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:07,362
I want to see exactly how his
caddy hands him those knives.

524
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,496
But ain't it kinda hot in here?
Couldn't we open a widow or somethir?

525
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:13,080
- Do you want this child to get pneumonia?
- But this ether...

526
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:15,237
Never mind the ether. Just
take care of that camera.

527
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:17,056
<i>Ready, Doctor.</i>

528
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:23,442
Good heavens, man, I told you
I didn't want Martha.

529
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:26,145
- You haven't got Martha. That's Ernestine.
- You sure?

530
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:28,711
- Of course I'm sure, you jackass.
- You must be mistaken.

531
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:30,850
Here. Look carefully.
There now. Isn't that Martha?

532
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,834
Don't you suppose I know my own children?
I tell you, that's Ernestine.

533
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,264
Well, if this isn't Martha,
we've made a horrible mistake.

534
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,466
We? What do you mean, we?

535
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:38,540
What kind of a mistake?

536
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:41,876
I know them by their tonsils. I
thought these were Martha's.

537
00:30:41,902 --> 00:30:44,011
They're the only ones
that didn't have to come out.

538
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:47,174
You mean you knocked my little
girl unconscious for no reason?

539
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,713
I'm sorry, but that's about it.

540
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:51,744
I'll admit it was careless, but you
do have an uncommon lot of them...

541
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:54,805
- and they all look alike to me.
- But what do we do now?

542
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:57,275
Take them out anyhow. They may
have to come out eventually.

543
00:30:57,301 --> 00:31:01,051
The worst part of an operation
is dreading it beforehand.

544
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:03,682
- Go get Martha ready.
- But she's been eating all morning.

545
00:31:03,757 --> 00:31:08,991
Never mind. Go get her. I'm not going
through another day like this.

546
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:13,559
Start grinding. At least
we'll salvage something.

547
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:18,406
<i>Poor Martha.</i>

548
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:23,570
<i>It was a blow, but in she went</i>
<i>full of pie, doughnuts and indignation.</i>

549
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,670
Frank.

550
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,911
What is all this about Martha?

551
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:32,372
This fool, Burton... he got her
mixed up with Ernestine.

552
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:33,457
It's all his fault.

553
00:31:33,483 --> 00:31:35,760
I don't care whose fault it is.
I think it's a shame...

554
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:38,686
after letting that poor child eat all
those doughnuts for breakfast...

555
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:40,933
only to be snatched up
and brought in to be butchered.

556
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,631
Now, there's nothing to
worry about, Lillie.

557
00:31:42,657 --> 00:31:44,242
It's no worse than
a mosquito bite.

558
00:31:44,268 --> 00:31:46,978
Besides, it's almost over. You
better wait in the other room.

559
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:48,151
Go on, dear.

560
00:31:48,204 --> 00:31:50,139
There we are.

561
00:31:50,206 --> 00:31:52,141
Keep grinding.

562
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,609
Frank, I think this whole thing...

563
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:57,044
But you're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

564
00:31:57,114 --> 00:32:00,310
All it takes is the tiniest little cut
at the back of the throat.

565
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:02,449
Just to show you it's
nothing, I'll go next.

566
00:32:02,475 --> 00:32:04,177
I thought you wanted
to watch your pictures.

567
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:05,330
Oh, I'll watch, all right.

568
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,654
I'm only gonna take a local anesthetic.
Ho-ho, I won't miss a thing.

569
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,457
But does Dr. Burton think a
local anesthetic is wise?

570
00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:12,883
That's just a lot of nonsense...

571
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:14,366
about my physical condition.

572
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:17,128
These doctors don't know what they're
talking about half the time.

573
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:20,368
I'll be in the amen corner
when they're laying him away.

574
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,406
Besides, I wanna get this over with
before lunch. I'm starved.

575
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:26,806
Gee, Dad, you act like
you're lookin forward to it.

576
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:30,837
Why, sure, son. There's nothing to it.
Huh! Just like rollin off a log.

577
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,645
All right, who's next?

578
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:34,612
<i>I am.</i>

579
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:37,145
Okay, make it snappy. A man
can stand just so much.

580
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:40,453
Frank, I hope you're not making a mistake.
After all, at your age...

581
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,585
Age has nothing
to do with it, Lillie.

582
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:45,129
It's simply a matter
of resolution.

583
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,130
Let's go.

584
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,770
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

585
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:57,240
<i>To Dad, a tonsil operation was nothing,</i>
<i>just like... how did he put it?</i>

586
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,301
<i>"Just like rolling off a log."</i>

587
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,684
<i>- Frank!</i>
- Oh, Lillie.

588
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:10,279
- My throat. This is awful.
- Yes. I know, dear.

589
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:13,416
- I... I can't talk.
- Nurse, I'll take him.

590
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,427
You're all right, old pioneer.

591
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,498
You just had to have it
the hard way, that's all.

592
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:20,133
- Lillie, I... I'm dying.
- Now, come on, old-timer.

593
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:22,134
I'll give you something
to make you sleep.

594
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:24,170
How am I gonna sleep
with my throat cut?

595
00:33:24,238 --> 00:33:27,901
- You'll be all right in a couple of weeks.
- Mr. Gilbreth! Mr. Gilbreth!

596
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:30,465
Go away. Go away. Can't
you see I'm dying?

597
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:31,536
I hate to tell you this,

598
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:35,471
but it looks like none of them
motion pictures'll be any good.

599
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:40,547
- No good?
- I forgot to put any film in the camera.

600
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:42,198
You what?<i></i>

601
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:44,514
Please. Oh, now, please,
please don't get excited.</i>

602
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,653
<i>- Anyhow, it's too much for me. I quit!</i>
- Let me at him.

603
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,719
- Frank!
- Let me at him!

604
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:35,071
Children, children. Now,
we are not doing our best.

605
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:38,978
Suppose we start over, and this time,
let's be sure everybody's in the same key.

606
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:41,050
Oh, it's no use, Miss Ethel.

607
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:44,310
We might as well face it.
We just haven't any musical talent.

608
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:46,513
We mustrt let our father
hear us say that.

609
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:48,250
Why? Doesn't he know yet?

610
00:34:48,276 --> 00:34:51,313
He takes it for granted that all
of his children are gifted.

611
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,851
Well, far be it for me
to disillusion him.

612
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,228
- Let's go.
- All right, children? Ready?

613
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:00,132
One, two, three...

614
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:38,501
Softly, now. Softly as a little brook
tinkling through a still forest.

615
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:53,619
Excuse me, but do you by any chance
hear a little brook...

616
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:55,625
tinkling through a still forest?

617
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:58,025
Poor Miss Ethel. What fortitude.

618
00:35:58,095 --> 00:36:00,030
You're home early, dear.

619
00:36:00,098 --> 00:36:02,429
Yes, I know.
Well, I had a letter today...

620
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:04,443
from Dr. Bleneim
of Czechoslovakia.

621
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:07,345
- Thought you might like to see it.
- Oh, do they want you to come?

622
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:10,698
There's nothing really definite yet,
but Bleneim thinks there's a good chance...

623
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:13,809
they'll ask me to speak at the International
Management Conference in Prague.

624
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:15,587
Oh, Frank, I knew they would.
May I see it?

625
00:36:15,613 --> 00:36:17,548
Let's not count our chickens
too soon.

626
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:19,550
This is gonna be
a pretty high-powered meeting.

627
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:21,950
It'll attract the best
scientific minds in the world.

628
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:24,973
That's why it's such a wonderful
opportunity to show other countries...

629
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:28,459
what motion study really is and have
your methods accepted universally.

630
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,419
I admit it's what
I've always hoped for.

631
00:36:30,496 --> 00:36:32,834
It might mean a great deal
financially too, Lillie.

632
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,691
But the important thing is...

633
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:37,826
that it will establish you as
a leader in the whole field.

634
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:42,933
- I'm so happy, Frank.
- I knew you'd be pleased. And why not?

635
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:45,420
After all, if it hadn't been
for you and your help...

636
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:48,213
- Will you tell the children tonight?
- You can tell them if you want...

637
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,015
but warn them...
not a word about it yet.

638
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,952
- But I won't be here tonight.
- You won't be here? Where are you going?

639
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,839
Have you forgotten? I have a
date at the hospital.

640
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:59,659
- So soon?
- Yes, dear, I'm afraid so.

641
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:02,355
But I thought you were only joking
about going to the hospital.

642
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,591
After all, you never went to one before
just to have a baby.

643
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:07,794
Maybe I never thought
about it before.

644
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,999
Going to be awfully lonely around here
without you, Lillie.

645
00:37:12,073 --> 00:37:14,063
<i>I'll hurry back</i>
<i>as quickly as I can.</i>

646
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:17,076
By the way,
do you mind what it is?

647
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:22,845
Why, I thought we'd already agreed it would
be a boy. After all, we have six girls.

648
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:25,680
But of course, anything you decide
will be all right with me.

649
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:28,347
Thank you, dear.
Have you thought of a name?

650
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:31,392
- Why, no, I haven't.
- What do you think of Robert?

651
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,791
Robert? Why Robert?
Who's named Robert?

652
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:36,490
Oh, no one in particular.
It's just a nice name, that's all.

653
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:39,766
I always knew you had a strange collection
of beaus during your college years...

654
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,346
but, uh, which one was Robert?

655
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:45,171
The one with the long hair and the violin,
or the one that lisped... like "thith"?

656
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,589
When you're quite through,
we'll decide on a name.

657
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:50,830
In the meantime, if you want to go into
the subject of old flames remember...

658
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:52,788
two can play at that game.

659
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,397
I seem to recall a
certain lady poetess...

660
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:56,605
Never mind. Never mind...

661
00:37:56,651 --> 00:38:00,808
I wouldn't think of blighting
an old schoolgirl romance.

662
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:04,049
Male or female, Robert it is.

663
00:38:07,629 --> 00:38:11,123
<i>For the 12th time,</i>
<i>Dad's verdict was exactly the same.</i>

664
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:14,693
Well, I'll say this for him.
He's every inch a Gilbreth.

665
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:19,730
- I'm glad you approve.
- Yes. I expect we'd better keep <i>him</i> too.

666
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:23,246
Well, Lillie, it's over. Twelve of'em.

667
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:25,474
And hardly an idiot
in the bunch.

668
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:28,279
And you were afraid you'd be
the last of the Gilbreths.

669
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:30,342
I admit, you had me worried
there for a while.

670
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,389
Four girls in a row.
That can be pretty nerve-racking.

671
00:38:33,456 --> 00:38:35,857
Of course, you know
I did it deliberately.

672
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:39,395
Come here, young fella.

673
00:38:39,463 --> 00:38:41,455
Let's you and me get acquainted.

674
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:44,932
Be careful with him, Frank.
I don't think hospitals approve of fathers.

675
00:38:45,002 --> 00:38:47,334
Hospitals. Heh.

676
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:52,035
Young man, did I ever tell you about the
night your mother and I were married...

677
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:55,636
and we decided to have
an even dozen like you, hmm?

678
00:38:55,713 --> 00:39:00,481
You set the actual target, dear...
six boys and six girls.

679
00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:02,917
I believe you even made
a memorandum of it.

680
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:07,083
That's right, son.
Sounds kind of silly now, doesn't it?

681
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,559
Not half as silly
as it sounded then.

682
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:16,099
Honestly, dear, did you really think
we'd be able to go through with it?

683
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:18,101
Why, certainly.

684
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:22,003
I always knew that anything you and I
teamed up on, Lillie, would be a success.

685
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:26,443
It'll seem kind of funny, won't it?
For the first time in 17 years...

686
00:39:26,512 --> 00:39:31,643
we'll be able to go to bed without
setting the alarm for a 2:00 feeding.

687
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:33,709
It's certainly gonna be a luxury,
isn't it?

688
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:37,922
A wonderful luxury...
and I'll hate it.

689
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:42,959
Well, Bob, you better
get back to your mother.

690
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:46,354
Looking after her is gonna be
one of your jobs from now on.

691
00:39:47,078 --> 00:39:51,472
And incidentally, young man,
she's a pretty wonderful woman.

692
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,131
Anyway, that's one
man's opinion.

693
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:02,646
<i>That's good. Smile, now.</i>

694
00:40:02,715 --> 00:40:05,240
<i>Smile so I can see</i>
<i>the whites of your teeth.</i>

695
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:09,584
<i>And stop fidgeting. How can I focus
this thing if you keep on fidgeting?</i>

696
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:11,920
Children, please be quiet.
This won't last much longer.

697
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:14,401
Anne, you're the oldest.
Help your mother keep them quiet.

698
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:16,693
I'm afraid that would require
an act of God.

699
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:20,096
Now, stop moving for all
our sakes and smile.

700
00:40:20,122 --> 00:40:23,670
That's right. Now, listen to your sister.
Come on, now. Let's have a great big smile.

701
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:25,438
Come on. Smile for Daddy.

702
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:28,100
That's better.
Are we all ready?

703
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,838
Jane, take your hands down from your ears.
That's a good girl.

704
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:33,471
Now, then, here we go.
Hold it. Hold it.

705
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:36,415
Ho-o-old it!

706
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:40,477
I think that was a good one, Lillie.
Ha-ha, this new flash certainly works fine.

707
00:40:40,554 --> 00:40:42,819
Yes, it certainly does.

708
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:46,088
- Now that we're all together, whadaya say?
- Yeah, it's a swell time.

709
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:48,493
You get the chair and the gavel,
and I'll get the table.

710
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:50,496
- Okay.
<i>- Thank you, dear.</i>

711
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:53,855
- Come, children. It's past your bedtime.
<i>- Before you go upstairs, Lillie...</i>

712
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:56,824
don't you think we ought to take one
more, just to be on the safe side?

713
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,919
- I think not, dear.
- Why, after all, we should.

714
00:40:58,945 --> 00:41:00,839
It's the first time we've
had all 12 together.

715
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:03,782
No, Frank. Seven explosions are
quite enough in one night.

716
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:05,746
Okay, Lillie. You're the boss.

717
00:41:06,182 --> 00:41:07,779
Well, what's that for?

718
00:41:07,805 --> 00:41:09,586
Dad, we've been talkir
something over...

719
00:41:09,612 --> 00:41:12,975
and we wondered, as long as we're all here,
if we couldn't have a family council.

720
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:14,692
Well, that's possible.
What's on your mind, son?

721
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,225
We want to do it legally,
Dad, in regular meeting.

722
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:19,870
Very good. All right, everybody.
Come on. Let's take seats.

723
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:21,373
No, Frank. I have to
get the babies to bed.

724
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,247
This won't take long.

725
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:24,324
- After all, if the children are interested...
- I'll take them up, Mother.

726
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,532
I, uh... I think they want you
down here.

727
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:29,726
All right, dear. But
what's all mystery about?

728
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:31,616
You'll find out. Come, Jane.

729
00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:35,275
All right, kids, take your places.
I'll be at your service in a moment.

730
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:38,439
Hurry up, there. Make it snappy.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

731
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:42,178
Now, then, are we all settled?

732
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:45,916
Now, the, uh... the family council
will please come to order.

733
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,923
Now, then, what's the problem?

734
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:49,925
- Mr. Chairman?
- Yes?

735
00:41:49,994 --> 00:41:53,156
It's been brought to our attention
that the assistant chairman... Mother...

736
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,289
intends to buy a new rug
for the dining room.

737
00:41:55,365 --> 00:41:59,310
And since the entire membership will be
required to look upon and sit in chairs...

738
00:41:59,336 --> 00:42:00,906
resting on said rug,

739
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:04,043
we move that the council be consulted
before any rug is purchased.

740
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:05,999
- Second the motion.
- Me too!

741
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:08,920
That's a point well taken.
Any discussion?

742
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:12,178
We'd like to ask the assistant chairman
how much it's going to cost.

743
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,407
$100.

744
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:17,145
Mr. Chairman, I move
that not more than $95 be spent.

745
00:42:17,188 --> 00:42:19,122
- Second the motion.
- Me too.

746
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,456
Well, this idea of saving five dollars is
a very laudable one. Let me commend you.

747
00:42:23,528 --> 00:42:27,811
Now, all those in favor of spending
only $95 for a rug signify by saying "aye."

748
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:28,677
Aye!

749
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:31,199
Carried. Now, is there
any further business?

750
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:35,544
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. I move we spend the
five dollars we've just saved to buy a dog.

751
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,737
<i>- Second the motion.</i>
- Out of order. Out of order.

752
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,933
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

753
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:42,152
You children know very well how I feel
about having animals around here.

754
00:42:42,178 --> 00:42:44,514
- But, Mr. Chairman, a dog would be a pet.
- William...

755
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,375
Everyone in the family could pat
him and I would be his master.

756
00:42:47,453 --> 00:42:50,912
A dog would be a friend, Mr. Chairman.
He could eat scraps of food, and...

757
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,925
- Save motions.
- What was that?

758
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:55,159
And that would save motions
for the garbage man.

759
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:58,125
A dog would keep burglars away.
He would sleep on the foot of my bed...

760
00:42:58,151 --> 00:43:00,107
and I would wash him
whenever he was dirty.

761
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:02,499
A dog would be an accursed
nuisance, that's what he'd be.

762
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:05,231
He'd be our master.
He'd eat us out of house and home.

763
00:43:05,305 --> 00:43:07,636
He'd spread fleas
from the garret to the basement.

764
00:43:07,707 --> 00:43:11,665
And he'd attach himself to me.
Ho, they always do. And I won't have it.

765
00:43:11,744 --> 00:43:13,722
- But, Mr. Chairman, I promise...
- No.

766
00:43:13,747 --> 00:43:16,198
No filthy, flea-bitten creature's
gonna share my bed and board.

767
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:18,078
- This whole idea is ridiculous.
- But, Mr. Chairman, I...

768
00:43:18,104 --> 00:43:20,027
Lillie, don't you see
where this is leading us?

769
00:43:20,054 --> 00:43:23,203
If we start throwing our money away like
this, the next thing they'll want is...

770
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:24,967
ponies, roadsters, trips to Hawaii.

771
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:26,960
You tell 'em
it's out of the question.

772
00:43:26,986 --> 00:43:29,454
I think, dear, we can rely
on the good sense of the children.

773
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,117
After all, a five-dollar dog...

774
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:32,874
- is not a trip to Hawaii.
- But, Lillie...

775
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,867
- Question.
- Vote! Vote! Vote!

776
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:38,497
No, no! This whole thing's out of order.
If I'd known what you were up to, I'd...

777
00:43:38,572 --> 00:43:41,235
- Vote! Vote! Vote!
- All those in favor...

778
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:43,606
- Aye!
- Ayes have it!

779
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:46,805
No. No. I still say no. No!

780
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:48,816
- The ayes have it, dear.
- But, Lillie...

781
00:43:48,883 --> 00:43:52,149
The meeting's adjourned.

782
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,212
A dog.

783
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:06,767
Mmm.

784
00:44:06,836 --> 00:44:08,803
<i>Dad was right.</i>

785
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:11,737
<i>There were 14 Gilbreths</i>
<i>in the house, but Mr. Chairman...</i>

786
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:14,517
<i>for thus was he christened...
soon dispelled all</i>

787
00:44:14,543 --> 00:44:17,031
<i>doubt as to which Gilbreth
was his favorite.</i>

788
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:25,347
<i>In no time at all,</i>
<i>they were bosom companions.</i>

789
00:44:30,827 --> 00:44:33,881
<i>There was no end</i>
<i>to Dad's determination to save time.</i>

790
00:44:33,907 --> 00:44:34,434
Ready? Go.

791
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,092
<i>And in these experiments, large or small,</i>
<i>Mother was always at his side...</i>

792
00:44:39,168 --> 00:44:41,364
<i>a partner in every enterprise.</i>

793
00:44:41,438 --> 00:44:43,770
- Stop. How long was that?
- Seven seconds.

794
00:44:43,841 --> 00:44:46,503
Good. Now we'll do it
the other way.

795
00:44:46,577 --> 00:44:48,510
- Ready?
- Go.

796
00:44:55,018 --> 00:44:59,045
That was better... only
five and a half seconds.

797
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:02,889
By jingo, I knew it. Bottom
to top, that's the answer.

798
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,293
<i>Along with Dad's,</i>
<i>Mother's fame as a psychologist...</i>

799
00:45:06,364 --> 00:45:09,697
<i>and industrial consultant had grown also...</i>

800
00:45:09,766 --> 00:45:15,228
<i>To such an extent that people came</i>
<i>from far and wide to solicit her help.</i>

801
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:21,445
- Mrs. Gilbreth?
- Yes?

802
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:25,210
I'm Amelia Mebane. I wonder if I
could talk with you for a moment.

803
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:27,325
I'm very busy. If...
If you could tell me...

804
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:29,883
Well, I'll only take
a moment of your time.

805
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:31,806
Well, won't you come in?

806
00:45:31,832 --> 00:45:33,614
Thank you.

807
00:45:36,395 --> 00:45:37,504
In here, please.

808
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:40,119
I understand you're very
civic-minded, Mrs. Gilbreth.

809
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:42,429
I believe in being
a good citizen, yes.

810
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,435
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

811
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:47,836
- You lecture too, I hear.
- Occasionally.

812
00:45:47,862 --> 00:45:50,236
- Now, just what is it you wanted to...
- Well, it's...

813
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:52,143
It's about birth control.

814
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:54,406
Birth control?

815
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,075
Yes. The National League
of Planned Parenthood...

816
00:45:57,149 --> 00:45:59,710
is organizing a local chapter
in Montclair.

817
00:45:59,786 --> 00:46:03,516
- I was told that you'd be interested.
- I?

818
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:07,457
I met a friend of yours on the train last
night... a next-door neighbor, I believe.

819
00:46:07,525 --> 00:46:10,394
She felt that you were just the person
we're looking for.

820
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:13,330
She was sure you'd be willing
to cooperate.

821
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,665
Well, just how would you want me
to cooperate?

822
00:46:16,736 --> 00:46:20,194
Why, by being the moving spirit
behind our Montclair chapter.

823
00:46:20,272 --> 00:46:22,265
That's a pretty big job,
isn't it?

824
00:46:22,342 --> 00:46:24,742
Oh, yes.
Yes, there's work to be done.

825
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:28,770
That's why I'm appealing to you...
a civic-minded career woman with a...

826
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:33,254
and this is most important... with a
large house where one can hold meetings.

827
00:46:34,522 --> 00:46:37,651
Well, of course,
I'll have to consult my husband.

828
00:46:37,726 --> 00:46:41,286
Oh, is he interested
in good works too?

829
00:46:41,362 --> 00:46:45,162
Oh, yes. I think he'll be
very interested in this.

830
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:48,225
- Excuse me. I'll call him.
- Certainly.

831
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:56,334
Can you come into the
living room a moment, dear?

832
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,635
I'm awfully busy, Lillie.

833
00:46:57,677 --> 00:47:00,571
But we have a guest, dear.
A lady from New York...

834
00:47:00,743 --> 00:47:03,560
who wants me to be the head
of the local birth control organization.

835
00:47:04,383 --> 00:47:05,461
Of the what?

836
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:08,820
Shh. It's a pretty
big job, dear.

837
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,255
Oh, indeed.

838
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:17,162
Well, in that case, Lillie,
let's go.

839
00:47:22,336 --> 00:47:24,533
Mrs. Mebane,
this is my husband, Mr. Gilbreth.

840
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:27,201
- How do you do, Mr. Gilbreth?
- A pleasure, madam.

841
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:31,110
It's a great pleasure to meet
a woman engaged in such a noble cause.

842
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:34,615
Thank you. And it's a pleasure
to find a man who thinks it <i>is</i> noble.

843
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:39,212
Usually we find the husbands so much less
sympathetic with our aims than the wives.

844
00:47:39,288 --> 00:47:42,279
You'd be surprised at some
of the horrible things men have said to me.

845
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:45,589
- Yes, I can imagine.
- And yet, if you could see, as I have...

846
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:48,925
relatively young women
growing old before their times.

847
00:47:48,997 --> 00:47:51,364
Ah, a pity. A great pity.

848
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,927
- Excuse me, Mrs. Mebane, just a moment.
- Why, of course.

849
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:04,384
Why, how odd. What's he doing, Mrs.
Gilbreth?

850
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,190
- Whistling.
- Oh, yes, I know.

851
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,116
- But why?
- Oh, he frequently whistles.

852
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:11,120
- Uh...
<i>- Gangway!</i>

853
00:48:13,189 --> 00:48:15,887
- Come on, Jackie.
- Hurry up, there. Pick up your feet.

854
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,657
Make it snappy. Where's Frank?
He's always late. Come here, Frank.

855
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,789
- Now, then. Are we all assembled?
- Yeah.

856
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:26,097
Fourteen seconds. By jingo, I knew
you could do it. It's a new world's record.

857
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,662
<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- Yeah, what'd you call us for?</i>

858
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,140
I want you to meet
a very important lady.

859
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:33,699
Now, come with me, children.
Watch your manners.

860
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:36,712
Children, this is Mrs. Mebane.

861
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,511
How do you do? How do you do?
Hello. Hello.

862
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:43,118
I... don't quite understand.
Is this a school?

863
00:48:43,356 --> 00:48:45,173
No, it isn't a school.

864
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:49,690
Then it's... No. Oh, no.
Yes, they <i>are.</i>

865
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:52,351
- They are what, madam?
- They're yours. Don't try to deny it.

866
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:54,635
I shouldn't think of
denying it, madam. Let

867
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:57,019
me introduce the family,
at least most of it.

868
00:48:57,046 --> 00:48:59,318
Seems to me there should be
some more of them around here.

869
00:48:59,343 --> 00:49:00,066
Heaven help us.

870
00:49:00,092 --> 00:49:02,590
Lillie, how many head of children
have we now, would you say offhand?

871
00:49:02,616 --> 00:49:05,384
Well, the last time I counted them, dear,
there seemed to be an even dozen.

872
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,051
A dozen?

873
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,975
I may have missed one
or two, but not many.

874
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:09,956
I'd say twelve
was a pretty fair guess.

875
00:49:09,982 --> 00:49:14,317
Disgusting. And within 18 miles
of national headquarters too.

876
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:17,358
- Shall we have some tea?
- Certainly not. Good day.

877
00:49:17,384 --> 00:49:18,934
- Good day, madam.
- Good day.

878
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,792
It looks to me as though
somebody's been pulling my leg!

879
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:23,402
How revolting.

880
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:26,758
And within 18 miles of
national headquarters too.

881
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:34,335
<i>Our summers, we spent at Nantucket...</i>

882
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:37,274
<i>in a cottage</i>
<i>and two abandoned lighthouses.</i>

883
00:49:37,345 --> 00:49:39,972
<i>Dad had named it "The Shoe"</i>
<i>in honor of Mother...</i>

884
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:44,814
<i>who, he said, reminded him</i>
<i>of the old woman who lived in one.</i>

885
00:49:44,886 --> 00:49:48,014
Come on, slowpokes.
Last one in is Kaiser Bill.

886
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,353
There you go, young lady.

887
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,023
You boys look out after her.

888
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,028
Come along, Anne, Ernestine.
There's nothing you can do about it.

889
00:49:57,054 --> 00:49:59,797
You know how your father feels
about the primitive life.

890
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:01,802
- Now, be good, children.
- We will.

891
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:03,803
You'd think Dad
invented this ocean.

892
00:50:03,871 --> 00:50:06,999
Andy.

893
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:09,509
Look. Is that Tom Black?

894
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:18,076
It certainly looks like him.

895
00:50:18,152 --> 00:50:21,089
It is. He's the lifeguard.

896
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:32,622
Oh, I can't imagine
what he's doing <i>here.</i>

897
00:50:32,701 --> 00:50:35,607
Well, he has to keep in condition
for swimming somewhere, doesn't he?

898
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:39,067
Oh, yes. But here...
in Nantucket.

899
00:50:39,142 --> 00:50:42,474
Leave your towels here, children.

900
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:44,479
Air.

901
00:50:44,546 --> 00:50:48,176
- Wonderful air. Ho-ho.
- Oh, now, Frank, please don't overdo it.

902
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:51,220
- You know what Dr. Burton said.
- That quack? He can't scare me.

903
00:50:51,287 --> 00:50:53,255
My heart's as good
as his any day. Better.

904
00:50:53,323 --> 00:50:55,348
But this water's always cold.
It's a shock.

905
00:50:55,374 --> 00:50:58,380
A good dip in the ocean never hurt anybody.
Hurry up. Get your robe off.

906
00:50:58,406 --> 00:51:01,575
- Let's go, kids.
- Come on, girls.

907
00:51:01,602 --> 00:51:03,482
The sooner we get this
over with, the better.

908
00:51:03,508 --> 00:51:04,558
You go on ahead, Mother.

909
00:51:04,584 --> 00:51:07,135
- We'll be in in just a few minutes.
- All right. But don't be long.

910
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:08,786
We won't.

911
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:25,247
- Why don't we stroll by and speak to him?
- Why should we?

912
00:51:25,322 --> 00:51:27,621
Well, after all, we see him
at school, don't we?

913
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:33,186
Yes. We see him,
but he doesn't even know I... we exist.

914
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:55,311
Flaming youth. Heh. Look at them!

915
00:52:01,192 --> 00:52:03,889
Fine spectacle:

916
00:52:03,963 --> 00:52:06,453
Bobbed hair, rolled stockings,
painted knees.

917
00:52:06,532 --> 00:52:08,919
I don't know what's
coming over girls today.

918
00:52:08,945 --> 00:52:12,315
Don't they know what's going to happen to
them if they go around looking like...

919
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:13,385
Jezebels?

920
00:52:13,411 --> 00:52:17,470
- Frank, that word's "Eskimo."
- "Jezebels" I said, and "Jezebels" I mean.

921
00:52:17,543 --> 00:52:19,806
But that's the way
everybody dresses today.

922
00:52:19,878 --> 00:52:24,076
Everybody but Ernestine and me.
Why, we're... we're freaks.

923
00:52:24,149 --> 00:52:27,052
Freaks or not,
you're not going around with bare knees...

924
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:29,782
for all the boys to ogle...
not while I'm alive.

925
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:32,284
Boys don't ogle when
everybody dresses that way.

926
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,309
Don't tell me what boys ogle.

927
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:35,662
I was young once myself.

928
00:52:35,688 --> 00:52:37,999
And I'd hate to tell you what
would have happened in my day...

929
00:52:38,025 --> 00:52:40,288
if girls had dressed like
some of these girls do today.

930
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:42,662
- What?
- Never you mind what.

931
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,832
But, Mother, what's wrong
with the way girls dress today?

932
00:52:46,899 --> 00:52:50,182
Is it a crime to try to look
as attractive as you can?

933
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,622
That isn't the point, dear.

934
00:52:51,677 --> 00:52:55,978
Men... that is, nice men... don't want to
marry girls who make themselves cheap.

935
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:58,348
They may run around with them
before they're married...

936
00:52:58,419 --> 00:53:01,183
but when they settle down,
they want someone they can respect.

937
00:53:01,255 --> 00:53:03,779
Well, they certainly respect me.

938
00:53:03,857 --> 00:53:06,453
I'm the most
respected girl I know.

939
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:09,411
Why, they respect me so much,
they won't even look at me.

940
00:53:09,438 --> 00:53:10,194
Me either.

941
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,424
That's too bad.

942
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:14,728
Honestly, Dad, how do you
expect us to ever be popular?

943
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:16,311
Popular! Popular!

944
00:53:16,337 --> 00:53:19,135
That's all I hear. That's
the magic word, isn't it?

945
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:21,267
That's what's the matter
with this generation.

946
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:23,276
Nobody thinks about
being smart or clever.

947
00:53:23,344 --> 00:53:25,711
Huh. No, sir.
They just want to be pop-ular!

948
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,579
- Huh.
- But, Dad, if you'd only be reasonable.

949
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:32,783
For the last time, no.
I'll not have any fancy women in my family.

950
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,089
If other people want to go to the
devil, that's their business.

951
00:53:35,115 --> 00:53:36,999
But you're not going with them.
Is that clear?

952
00:53:37,025 --> 00:53:39,035
It oughta be.
We've heard it often enough.

953
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:41,806
Otherwise you'll find yourself
right in that convent...

954
00:53:41,832 --> 00:53:44,012
the one with the 12-foot wall.

955
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:46,398
Mother, what are we gonna do?

956
00:53:46,468 --> 00:53:48,975
Go back and have your swim, dear.
I'll talk to your father.

957
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:51,647
- Oh, but, Mother, you...
- I know, dear. I understand.

958
00:53:51,673 --> 00:53:54,436
- Now, you girls run along.
- I don't feel like going in, Mother.

959
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:57,606
- I'll help you with the table.
- All right, dear.

960
00:53:57,681 --> 00:53:59,894
<i>I want it back. You said I could have it.</i>

961
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,240
<i>Give it to me!</i>

962
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:03,710
<i>No, you don't.</i>
<i>Come on and catch me, if you want it.</i>

963
00:54:03,736 --> 00:54:06,406
- But it's my turn to play with that ball.
- If you want it, get it.

964
00:54:06,432 --> 00:54:09,497
Andy, button me, will you, please?

965
00:54:09,523 --> 00:54:12,653
"Button me." That's all I
hear from morning till night.

966
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:15,528
It's, "Andy, button me up,"
or "Andy, unbutton me."

967
00:54:15,598 --> 00:54:19,261
- Aw, you're not mad.
- No, but I'm fed up.

968
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:21,737
Honestly, won't you ever learn
to button yourself?

969
00:54:21,763 --> 00:54:23,969
You're pretty when you're mad.

970
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:26,941
Oh, you little dickens. Go on.
Get outta here.

971
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:17,027
Look out, convent. Here I come.
And I mean the one with the 12-foot wall.

972
00:55:17,095 --> 00:55:19,962
- What have you done now?
- Nothing. It's what I'm about to do.

973
00:55:20,032 --> 00:55:23,000
And I want you to know
I'm not doing this just for myself.

974
00:55:23,068 --> 00:55:26,004
I'm doing it for you and Martha and Mary
and Lillian and Jane...

975
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:29,735
'cause I know you'll never be emancipated
until I pave the way.

976
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:32,073
What are you talking about?
Oh, Anne, you're not.

977
00:55:32,145 --> 00:55:35,045
I've got to, otherwise
we'll all go to our graves old maids...

978
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:38,050
still wearing cootie garages over our ears
and long drawers.

979
00:55:38,118 --> 00:55:40,585
- Oh, but Dad'll murder you.
- You'll back me up, won't you?

980
00:55:40,653 --> 00:55:43,451
Of course I will.
But who's gonna back Dad up?

981
00:55:43,523 --> 00:55:45,718
Someone's got to
take a stand somewhere...

982
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:47,917
and I've made up my mind...
I'm going to.

983
00:55:47,993 --> 00:55:49,963
- Oh, but, Anne...
- There!

984
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,295
Oh, no.

985
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:55,059
- What is it, Dad?
- Whatcha got?

986
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:58,657
Now, hold your horses. Keep your shirts on.
You remember I promised you children...

987
00:55:58,683 --> 00:56:00,809
there'd be no formal
studying this summer...

988
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:02,810
no language lessons
or schoolbooks.

989
00:56:02,836 --> 00:56:05,777
But I've discovered a way to teach you
the Morse code without studying.

990
00:56:05,804 --> 00:56:08,258
- Oh, Dad, do we have to?
- Not if you don't want to.

991
00:56:08,284 --> 00:56:11,513
But those who don't are gonna be sorry.
Yes, indeedy.

992
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:14,364
I've painted the code on the bathroom
wall... the one that faces you.

993
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:17,058
Now, you don't have to make a project
of studying it, but, uh...

994
00:56:17,084 --> 00:56:19,959
you'll be surprised how much
you'll absorb each day when...

995
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:22,428
- Who's that?
- It's a telegram. I'll get it.

996
00:56:22,497 --> 00:56:25,295
It's all right, Frank. It's probably
for me. I'll go. Hold that.

997
00:56:25,366 --> 00:56:27,459
- Let me see it.
- I will. Just a minute.

998
00:56:27,535 --> 00:56:29,798
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

999
00:56:29,825 --> 00:56:31,885
Martha, will you call Anne
and Ernestine, please?

1000
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:32,976
Yes'm.

1001
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,611
There we are. Thank you, Jed.

1002
00:56:38,637 --> 00:56:41,305
- 'Twas no bother. How's the family?
- Oh, couldn't be better.

1003
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,634
Good. Glad to see you
back, Mr. Gilbreth.

1004
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,294
- Thank you very much.
- Be seeing you.

1005
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,462
Right.

1006
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,888
<i>Don't poke it so hard.</i>

1007
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:54,055
<i>Get down, Fred.</i>
<i>You want to break it?</i>

1008
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:58,362
- What is it, dear?
- A cable from Bleneim in Prague.

1009
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:01,962
It seems the management conference program
is filled without me.

1010
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:05,475
- Oh, Frank, really?
- Bleneim says he's still working...

1011
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:07,942
but for me not to count on it.

1012
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:12,023
He's trying to let me down easy, but I
gather there's a general lack of interest.

1013
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:13,369
I'm sorry, dear.

1014
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:16,194
But don't be too disappointed.
There'll be other conferences.

1015
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,816
I suppose I was counting on it
too much, Lillie, but...

1016
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:23,053
Well, no use crying
over spilt milk.

1017
00:57:23,126 --> 00:57:25,651
You go ahead with dinner.
I'll be right in.

1018
00:57:25,677 --> 00:57:26,965
All right, dear.

1019
00:57:29,132 --> 00:57:31,192
<i>Hey, see what you've done?</i>

1020
00:57:31,268 --> 00:57:33,794
<i>It's just a screw. Here, I'll fix it.</i>

1021
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:35,805
<i>You better before Daddy sees it.</i>

1022
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:37,807
<i>There. Now it's all right.</i>

1023
00:57:37,874 --> 00:57:39,809
<i>- Let me work it.</i>
<i>- Wait a minute!</i>

1024
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:42,641
Leave that alone, now,
children. Sit down.

1025
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:44,704
Come along.

1026
00:57:45,783 --> 00:57:48,775
I'll take those, Mrs. Monahan.

1027
00:57:54,425 --> 00:57:56,860
- Where's Anne?
- She's coming up, Mother.

1028
00:57:56,929 --> 00:57:59,294
Come along, dear. We're rea...

1029
00:57:59,364 --> 00:58:01,297
Anne, what have you done?

1030
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:03,857
- Look at yourself.
- Oh, I have looked at myself, Mother.

1031
00:58:03,935 --> 00:58:07,393
Please don't ask me to look again.
I don't want to spoil my appetite.

1032
00:58:07,473 --> 00:58:11,170
- But your hair. Your beautiful hair.
- What's the matter with her hair?

1033
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:13,178
Take that ridiculous wig off.

1034
00:58:13,244 --> 00:58:16,009
- It's not a wig. I've cut my hair.
- You've what?

1035
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:18,514
You can kill me if you want to,
but I've done it.

1036
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:21,145
I think it looks snaky.
Besides, it's more efficient.

1037
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,753
I'll bet she can fix her
hair now in 15 seconds.

1038
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:24,851
Fix what hair?

1039
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:28,664
- She hasn't any hair left to fix.
- Anne, how could you do this to yourself?

1040
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:30,859
Herself? How could she do it
to an Airedale?

1041
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:33,740
Well, I won't have it.
I want it grown back fast.

1042
00:58:33,766 --> 00:58:37,510
I'm not gonna grow it back. I don't care
what you say. I'm sick of being a freak!

1043
00:58:37,536 --> 00:58:40,209
- Anne, come back here. Anne?
- Let her go, dear.

1044
00:58:40,236 --> 00:58:42,024
After all, it isn't such a tragedy.

1045
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:44,429
All the girls her age are
bobbing their hair now.

1046
00:58:44,455 --> 00:58:45,763
But I distinctly told her...

1047
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:48,477
But you forget. She's growing up.
She's no longer a child.

1048
00:58:48,503 --> 00:58:50,382
She has to make some
decisions for herself.

1049
00:58:50,408 --> 00:58:52,535
Nevertheless, I'm not gonna
have her defying me...

1050
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:53,854
Please, come and have dinner.

1051
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,596
I'll talk to her after we've
had time to think this over.

1052
00:58:56,622 --> 00:58:59,336
But, Lillie, if we start letting
the children do as they please...

1053
00:58:59,362 --> 00:59:01,437
Please, dear, for my sake.

1054
00:59:01,728 --> 00:59:05,220
Well, all right, Lillie, but...

1055
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:13,573
<i>By the time vacation was over...</i>

1056
00:59:13,641 --> 00:59:15,701
<i>and we were on our way</i>
<i>back to Montclair...</i>

1057
00:59:15,777 --> 00:59:17,710
<i>Dad was reconciled.</i>

1058
00:59:17,778 --> 00:59:20,746
<i>My bobbed hair had been a bitter pill</i>
<i>for him to swallow...</i>

1059
00:59:20,814 --> 00:59:23,649
<i>but like all fathers</i>
<i>from the beginning of time...</i>

1060
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:26,778
<i>he gulped and swallowed it.</i>

1061
00:59:39,602 --> 00:59:43,368
<i>- What's that?</i>
- Oh. Hello, Daddy. Come on in.

1062
00:59:43,439 --> 00:59:45,429
You might as well know
the worst. I...

1063
00:59:45,507 --> 00:59:48,135
I bought these with my own money
and I'm going to wear them.

1064
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:51,113
Oh, no, you're not. You're gonna
take them back where you got them.

1065
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:54,308
- They embarrass me even to look at them.
- Oh, but, Dad...

1066
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:57,682
Do you mean to tell me this is all
the underwear women put on nowadays?

1067
00:59:57,753 --> 01:00:01,085
But they don't show. Besides,
Dad, everybody wears them now.

1068
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:03,541
If you don't believe me,
you can come and see for yourself.

1069
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:05,502
That won't be necessary.

1070
01:00:05,528 --> 01:00:08,361
Oh, Daddy, please
be sensible. You...

1071
01:00:08,431 --> 01:00:12,925
You don't really mean I have to
take them back? Not really, do you, Dad?

1072
01:00:13,002 --> 01:00:16,666
- Do you?
- Well, all right.

1073
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,003
But no silk stockings
and high-heeled shoes.

1074
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:21,772
I'm not gonna have a lot of doctor bills
because of foot trouble.

1075
01:00:21,845 --> 01:00:24,075
Thank you, Dad.
And while we're both in the mood...

1076
01:00:24,147 --> 01:00:26,547
you might as well know
it's a little late for that now.

1077
01:00:26,617 --> 01:00:29,484
I've been wearing them
ever since we came home from Nantucket.

1078
01:00:29,553 --> 01:00:31,885
- Now, Anne...
<i>- Andy! Andy, telephone!</i>

1079
01:00:31,955 --> 01:00:36,186
<i>- It's a boy calling!</i>
- A boy? Excuse me, Dad!

1080
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:39,424
Come back here.
I'm not saying you can wear those things.

1081
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:42,728
- Better hurry up before he gets away.
- Who do you suppose it is?

1082
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,292
- Yeah, who could be calling <i>you?</i>
- Shut up.

1083
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:50,500
Hello. Oh, hello, Joe.

1084
01:00:50,574 --> 01:00:52,770
Fine, thank you.

1085
01:00:52,844 --> 01:00:57,577
What? Oh, I'd love to.
You will?

1086
01:00:57,649 --> 01:01:00,413
8:00? Oh, that would be
simply wonderful.

1087
01:01:00,485 --> 01:01:02,782
Thank you for calling.
Good-bye.

1088
01:01:02,853 --> 01:01:06,085
You see, Dad? I told you if I started
dressing like the other girls...

1089
01:01:06,157 --> 01:01:08,626
- everything would be all right.
- Who was it, dear?

1090
01:01:08,694 --> 01:01:12,151
Joe Scales. He's asked me
to the senior prom Friday night.

1091
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:15,927
- It's <i>the</i> dance of the year.
- Why, how lovely, dear. I'm so glad.

1092
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,934
Who's Joe Scales? Is he nice?

1093
01:01:18,003 --> 01:01:21,547
Well, he comes from an awfully nice
family, and he's a cheerleader.

1094
01:01:21,573 --> 01:01:24,871
- He's got his own car too.
- Two fine recommendations.

1095
01:01:24,897 --> 01:01:26,057
What about a raccoon coat?

1096
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:29,133
Oh, he'll probably get that next
year when he goes to college.

1097
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:29,962
Gee!

1098
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:32,986
Come on. I've got to decide
what I'm gonna wear. It's formal.

1099
01:01:33,012 --> 01:01:36,648
- Just a minute. Friday night, you say?
- Yes.

1100
01:01:36,723 --> 01:01:40,055
Let me see. Um, yes. That's all right.
I can make it.

1101
01:01:40,126 --> 01:01:42,390
- You can make what?
- The dance, of course.

1102
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:45,655
You didn't think I was gonna let you go out
by yourself with a cheerleader, did you?

1103
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:48,890
Daddy, you wouldn't spoil everything
by doing a thing like that, would you?

1104
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:51,097
- What'll he think of me?
- That you're a sensible...

1105
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,105
well brought-up child
with sensible parents.

1106
01:01:53,173 --> 01:01:55,903
Honestly, Dad, don't you trust
your own flesh and blood?

1107
01:01:55,975 --> 01:01:58,637
Of course I trust you.
I trust all my daughters.

1108
01:01:58,712 --> 01:02:01,772
- It's that cheerleader I don't trust.
- Oh, no.

1109
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:05,807
Now, make up your mind to it.
Either I go, or you don't.

1110
01:02:05,884 --> 01:02:08,603
Well, shall I tell him we'll
go in his car or ours?

1111
01:02:08,629 --> 01:02:09,481
<i>His</i> car?

1112
01:02:09,507 --> 01:02:13,483
Ho-ho, I should say not. I haven't seen
it, but I can imagine what it's like.

1113
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,688
We'll go in Foolish Carriage.

1114
01:02:15,763 --> 01:02:17,993
Come on, Lillie.

1115
01:02:18,065 --> 01:02:20,295
Oh, when you and the others
start going out...

1116
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:24,362
I just hope you appreciate
what I've had to suffer for you.

1117
01:02:46,561 --> 01:02:48,858
- Come on, Joe.
- Okay, baby.

1118
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,299
Is your pop ready?

1119
01:02:53,368 --> 01:02:56,419
Great Caesar's ghost, Lillie,
it's Joe College in the flesh.

1120
01:02:56,771 --> 01:02:59,152
And if he "pops" me once more,
I'll pop him right back.

1121
01:02:59,178 --> 01:03:02,451
Shh, dear. I think he's kind
of cute, in a vest pocket way.

1122
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:03,893
Cute? Heh.

1123
01:03:03,979 --> 01:03:07,507
He looks like what might happen if a
pygmy married a bob-tailed penguin.

1124
01:03:07,582 --> 01:03:09,778
And look at that car.

1125
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:12,946
Well, don't worry. You'll be riding
in yours, not that contraption.

1126
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:16,753
Thank heavens for small favors.
I'd better bring Foolish Carriage around.

1127
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:20,261
Come on, children. Come on.

1128
01:03:20,328 --> 01:03:23,924
Boy, oh, boy.
You look good enough to eat.

1129
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,264
And I'll bet you do. Get it?

1130
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,735
"I'll bet you do... eat"?

1131
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,069
Won't you come in, Joe?
I'd like you to meet my family.

1132
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:36,340
Sure, baby. It'll be a pleasure.

1133
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:39,745
Now, you children behave yourselves.

1134
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:43,082
- Mother, this is Mr. Scales.
- Good evening, Mr. Scales.

1135
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:45,587
- Hiya, Mrs. Gilbreth.
- I'm fine, thank you.

1136
01:03:45,802 --> 01:03:47,938
And these are Anne's
brothers and sisters.

1137
01:03:47,964 --> 01:03:48,789
Hiya, gang.

1138
01:03:48,815 --> 01:03:50,964
- Hi.
- This is quite a family.

1139
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:53,472
Yes. Will you excuse me, please,
while I get my wrap?

1140
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:56,159
Why, sure, baby. On the
double quick, huh?

1141
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:57,830
Won't you sit down, Mr. Scales?

1142
01:03:57,856 --> 01:04:00,217
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.
We'll only be a minute.

1143
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:03,540
- Well, just make yourself at home.
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

1144
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:05,876
- What's new, kids?
- Nothir.

1145
01:04:05,944 --> 01:04:08,673
- Um, did you ever see a William Tell tie?
- Uh-uh.

1146
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:13,409
You didn't, huh? Well, you pull the
bow, and it hits the apple, get it?

1147
01:04:13,485 --> 01:04:16,750
It hits the apple... the Adam's apple, see?

1148
01:04:16,822 --> 01:04:19,312
Gee, you're the first cheerleader
we ever saw up close.

1149
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,881
- Yeah?
- How about showing us how you do a yell?

1150
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,691
- Andy and Ern taught most of'em to us.
- I don't mind if I do.

1151
01:04:25,763 --> 01:04:28,733
- Do you know the old Montclair High rah?
- We know that one.

1152
01:04:28,801 --> 01:04:31,292
Let's hit it.
Let me get rid of my hat.

1153
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,634
- I wanna hear you holler, get me?
- Yeah.

1154
01:04:33,706 --> 01:04:38,404
- Ready?
- Rah! Rah! Rah, rah, rah!

1155
01:04:38,476 --> 01:04:43,278
Rah, rah, Montclair! Rah, rah, Montclair!
Hoo-rah! Hoo-rah!

1156
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:46,045
<i>Oh, you Montclair!</i>

1157
01:04:46,118 --> 01:04:48,929
- Psst. Psst.
<i>- Gee, I wish I could be a cheerleader.</i>

1158
01:04:48,978 --> 01:04:50,280
How did you get to be one?

1159
01:04:50,311 --> 01:04:53,456
<i>- You gotta get elected.</i>
<i>- But don't you have to practice?</i>

1160
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:56,496
<i>- I don't know. It just comes natural.</i>
- The car won't start.

1161
01:04:56,563 --> 01:04:58,497
- What'll I do?
- Go in his car.

1162
01:04:58,564 --> 01:05:01,534
Do I look like a chicken
waiting for a place to roost?

1163
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,628
He isn't very big.
I don't think anything will happen to Anne.

1164
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:06,934
Maybe if you warn her
to come home early.

1165
01:05:07,007 --> 01:05:10,909
I said I was going and I am, even if
it has to be in that insane calliope.

1166
01:05:10,976 --> 01:05:14,845
- Daddy, have you metJoe?
- Uh, not yet, I haven't.

1167
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:18,578
All set, huh?
Mighty fancy, I'll say.

1168
01:05:18,652 --> 01:05:22,452
- This is my father, Mr. Gilbreth.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Gilbreth.

1169
01:05:22,523 --> 01:05:23,719
Good evening, young man.

1170
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:26,470
I hear you kind of go in for
this time-saving racket.

1171
01:05:26,496 --> 01:05:28,260
I manage to make a fair living.

1172
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:29,461
I got a few ideas.

1173
01:05:29,488 --> 01:05:32,437
I'd like to talk to you about sometime.
That would be a great pleasure.

1174
01:05:32,463 --> 01:05:34,910
We're late. Don't you
think we ought to go?

1175
01:05:34,936 --> 01:05:36,492
Let's shake that thing.

1176
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:38,145
Good night, gang. Good night, Mrs.
Gilbreth.

1177
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:38,792
<i>Good night!</i>

1178
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:42,163
Good night, Mr. Scales.
Have a good time, dear.

1179
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:43,547
We will, Mother.

1180
01:05:43,682 --> 01:05:45,404
I know it's not
your fault, Lillie...

1181
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:47,391
but things would have been
a whole lot easier...

1182
01:05:47,417 --> 01:05:49,375
if you'd taken my advice
and had all boys.

1183
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,908
I'm sorry, dear. I'll try to be
more careful with the next dozen.

1184
01:05:52,987 --> 01:05:57,390
Boy, is that a car!
I bet you he can do 50 in it.

1185
01:05:57,459 --> 01:05:59,877
What's so wonderful about that?
Fifty's not so fast.

1186
01:05:59,903 --> 01:06:02,183
Yeah? Well, I'd like
to see you do it, fatty.

1187
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:03,271
You shut up.

1188
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:05,231
Shh!

1189
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,970
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night, dear.

1190
01:06:07,996 --> 01:06:09,845
How's about the little old
rumble seat, pops?

1191
01:06:09,871 --> 01:06:11,964
You know the old saying, "Two's company."

1192
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,794
I'm well acquainted
with that expression, young man.

1193
01:06:16,311 --> 01:06:18,262
- You all right, Dad?
- Dandy.

1194
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:21,462
And now, if you'll be good enough
to keep it down to a dull roar, let's go.

1195
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:23,716
Right!

1196
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,691
- Special delivery for Mr. Frank Gilbreth.
- I'll sign for it.

1197
01:06:40,903 --> 01:06:42,837
- Thank you.
- Good night.

1198
01:06:42,905 --> 01:06:44,897
Good night.

1199
01:06:47,077 --> 01:06:50,012
- Who's it from?
- It's postmarked "Prague."

1200
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,148
- Mother, it's the invitation.
- Oh, I hope so.

1201
01:06:53,174 --> 01:06:55,853
Go on, Mother. Open it. You
know Dad would want you to.

1202
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:56,707
Yes, go on.

1203
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:59,584
- But I hate to open anyone else's mail.
- Oh, but this is different.

1204
01:06:59,657 --> 01:07:03,150
- Yes, I suppose he wouldn't really mind.
- Of course he wouldn't.

1205
01:07:07,463 --> 01:07:09,419
Listen. "Dear Gilbreth...

1206
01:07:09,445 --> 01:07:12,415
"the board of directors of the
International Management Conference..."

1207
01:07:12,441 --> 01:07:15,270
"have voted unanimously
to extend to you an invitation..."

1208
01:07:15,339 --> 01:07:17,423
"to speak at their forthcoming
meeting in Prague."

1209
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:18,355
Oh, Mother.

1210
01:07:18,381 --> 01:07:21,068
"At the same time, I
am reliably informed...

1211
01:07:21,093 --> 01:07:23,056
"a similar invitation
will be extended to you...

1212
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:26,847
to address the World Power
Conference in London. Bleneim."

1213
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:30,616
- Gee, and Dad just missed it.
- I wish I could get this to him somehow.

1214
01:07:30,642 --> 01:07:33,275
- Couldn't we telephone him?
- There's no telephone in the gym.

1215
01:07:33,301 --> 01:07:36,348
You hop on your bicycle
and run down there and give it to him.

1216
01:07:36,374 --> 01:07:37,473
Okay, Mother. Sure.

1217
01:07:37,499 --> 01:07:39,863
That's a good boy.

1218
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,991
Wouldn't you give anything to see
Daddy's face when he reads it?

1219
01:07:43,068 --> 01:07:45,093
Yes, dear, anything.

1220
01:07:45,171 --> 01:07:48,629
Well, unfortunately, I
can't ride a bicycle.

1221
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:01,748
- Hiya, Joe. Hi, Anne.
- Hiya, fellas. Here you are, sonny boy.

1222
01:08:01,822 --> 01:08:04,790
What held you two up?
Kinda early to start neckin, ain't it?

1223
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:07,849
- Shh. Ixnay. Ixnay.
- Oh, excuse me, sir.

1224
01:08:07,928 --> 01:08:09,953
<i>Hello, Anne. Hi, Anne.</i>

1225
01:08:12,364 --> 01:08:14,299
Gee, it's her father.

1226
01:08:14,367 --> 01:08:17,825
- What's he doing here?
- Chaperoning Anne. Isn't it a scream?

1227
01:08:17,904 --> 01:08:22,307
The way that cookie's looking tonight,
she <i>needs</i> chaperoning.

1228
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,683
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hiya, pal.

1229
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:33,628
- Where'd you get the hand-me-downs?
- Easy. Don't bruise the material.

1230
01:08:33,654 --> 01:08:35,712
Hey, Joe, who's the third wheel?

1231
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:37,990
Yeah, you said it.
Third wheel is right.

1232
01:08:38,124 --> 01:08:42,084
You see, Dad? Everybody's talking.
I don't know why boys even bother with me.

1233
01:08:42,163 --> 01:08:45,394
Well, I know, if you don't,
and that's exactly why I'm here.

1234
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:48,992
Don't you sort of feel like... like
what they said... a third wheel?

1235
01:08:49,018 --> 01:08:51,670
Yes. That's what I'm
gonna keep on being.

1236
01:08:51,696 --> 01:08:53,839
I might not be able to whip
some of these fullbacks...

1237
01:08:53,865 --> 01:08:55,981
but if I see any of them
start taking liberties...

1238
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:58,504
at least I'll be able
to run for help.

1239
01:08:58,579 --> 01:09:01,309
All set, baby? Come on.
Let's give it the old hips.

1240
01:09:01,381 --> 01:09:04,375
So long, pop.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1241
01:09:05,454 --> 01:09:07,945
"Pop."

1242
01:09:14,428 --> 01:09:16,660
- Lipstick, honey?
- No, thanks.

1243
01:09:16,732 --> 01:09:19,962
Do me a favor, will you, sugar?
Look in my bag and hand me my perfume.

1244
01:09:20,035 --> 01:09:23,665
Sure, Debby. Oh, what
a darling bottle.

1245
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:25,256
Well, go ahead. Help yourself.

1246
01:09:25,282 --> 01:09:27,991
Oh, I don't think I should.
I never use perfume.

1247
01:09:28,017 --> 01:09:32,333
You don't? Why, I'd simply die
before I'd go out without my perfume on.

1248
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:36,276
Why, I'd feel positively naked.
Go on. Put a little behind your ear.

1249
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:40,913
Well, maybe just a dab won't matter.
Oh, it's wonderful, Debby.

1250
01:09:40,989 --> 01:09:43,720
A little old boy I met
in New Haven sent it to me.

1251
01:09:43,793 --> 01:09:48,026
You know something? I just got to meet
your daddy. I think he's so cute.

1252
01:09:48,098 --> 01:09:51,066
All the girls at school do.
I could just eat him up.

1253
01:09:51,134 --> 01:09:53,693
That's nice, but he's kind
of old-fashioned, you know.

1254
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:57,364
Then I'll just adore him, 'cause I'm
awfully old-fashioned myself too.

1255
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,602
Maybe it's 'cause
I was born in Mississippi.

1256
01:09:59,676 --> 01:10:01,968
You got to be old-fashioned
to be born in Mississippi.

1257
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:03,923
But you will be careful,
won't you, Debby...

1258
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,942
about the perfume and
lipstick and everything?

1259
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:10,552
Now, don't you worry, honey. My daddy's
the same way... always carryin on about me.

1260
01:10:10,621 --> 01:10:14,455
But I notice he doesn't carry on
when it's someone else's daughter.

1261
01:10:24,234 --> 01:10:26,795
<i>- Dad?</i>
- Oh, Anne.

1262
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:30,328
Dad, I'd like you to meet one of my
very dearest friends, Deborah Lancaster.

1263
01:10:30,407 --> 01:10:32,342
- She's from Mississippi.
- How do you do?

1264
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,606
I've just been dying to get somebody
to introduce me, Mr. Gilbreth.

1265
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,208
Why, I've been hoping to meet you
ever since you started visiting our school.

1266
01:10:39,284 --> 01:10:42,879
Is that so? Well, well.
I'm delighted. Delighted.

1267
01:10:42,954 --> 01:10:44,889
So, you're from
Mississippi, are you?

1268
01:10:44,956 --> 01:10:47,823
Yes, sir. I'm just a little old fugitive
from a plantation.

1269
01:10:47,892 --> 01:10:49,827
Pardon me.

1270
01:10:49,895 --> 01:10:51,828
- Hello, Debby.
- Hello, honey.

1271
01:10:51,896 --> 01:10:54,421
- Dad, this is Tom Black.
- How do you do?

1272
01:10:54,499 --> 01:10:57,901
- How are you, Mr. Gilbreth?
- I'm very well, thank you, young man.

1273
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:00,700
- At least I was.
- I'm sorry. How about a dance?

1274
01:11:00,773 --> 01:11:02,581
- You mind, Dad?
- Not at all.

1275
01:11:02,607 --> 01:11:05,267
I'm sure this young lady and I
will have a very pleasant time.

1276
01:11:05,293 --> 01:11:07,566
We won't be long.

1277
01:11:07,612 --> 01:11:10,583
- Hey, what have you done to yourself?
- Nothing. What do you mean?

1278
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,141
You didn't look like this
in Nantucket last summer, baby.

1279
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:15,842
How would you know what I looked like?
You never even noticed.

1280
01:11:15,868 --> 01:11:17,442
Well, I'm noticing you now...

1281
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,480
and I <i>mean.</i>

1282
01:11:22,094 --> 01:11:25,064
If you'd rather be out there dancing,
don't let me detain you.

1283
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:28,658
Oh, no, Mr. Gilbreth.
I'd much rather sit this one out with you.

1284
01:11:28,735 --> 01:11:31,931
Anne tells me you've just been
revolutionizing industry...

1285
01:11:32,004 --> 01:11:35,304
just saving millions of dollars
in time and things.

1286
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,742
- By jingo, that smells good.
- Do you like it?

1287
01:11:37,811 --> 01:11:41,542
A little old boy from New Haven
sent it to me. But I mean,

1288
01:11:41,615 --> 01:11:44,743
What does anybody want
to save all that time for, Mr. Gilbreth?

1289
01:11:44,818 --> 01:11:47,719
So as to be able to sit here and talk...

1290
01:11:47,788 --> 01:11:50,279
to a...
Pretty little lady like you.

1291
01:11:50,357 --> 01:11:54,795
Why, I declare. Anne didn't tell me
she had such a gallant daddy...

1292
01:11:54,861 --> 01:11:56,796
and so good-looking too.

1293
01:11:56,864 --> 01:12:00,129
- I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
- You'd be surprised...

1294
01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:02,431
at the things other girls
are saying about you.

1295
01:12:02,503 --> 01:12:05,735
Why, they're only hopin you'll come
to all our dances from now on.

1296
01:12:05,807 --> 01:12:07,740
Is that so?
Well, if I'd known that...

1297
01:12:07,808 --> 01:12:10,072
I'd have started comin sooner.

1298
01:12:10,144 --> 01:12:13,978
There just gonna hate me if they
don't get to meet you too. You mind?

1299
01:12:14,048 --> 01:12:17,507
Oh, no. No. Of course not.
Bring 'em over. As many as you like.

1300
01:12:17,586 --> 01:12:20,987
Oh, thank you, sugar... I mean...
Excuse me, Mr. Gilbreth.

1301
01:12:21,056 --> 01:12:25,048
Now, don't you go away, you hear me?
I'll be right back.

1302
01:12:40,576 --> 01:12:43,909
- How about some punch?
- Oh, I'd love some.

1303
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:47,221
- Say, your old man sure is swell.
- Dad's really sweet, but...

1304
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:50,968
Believe me, you've got to hand it to him,
coming here like this just to look after you.

1305
01:12:50,994 --> 01:12:54,379
- I tried to get him not to, but...
- I'll get it.

1306
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:56,949
- Excuse me, Mike.
- Sure, Tom.

1307
01:12:58,621 --> 01:12:59,807
Hope you like pineapple.

1308
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:00,995
I do.

1309
01:13:01,021 --> 01:13:03,752
I mean, where are you gonna
find fathers like yours today?

1310
01:13:03,801 --> 01:13:06,030
- Sure bet you're proud of him.
- Proud of him?

1311
01:13:06,102 --> 01:13:09,048
If I ever have a daughter,
I'm sure gonna watch after her.

1312
01:13:09,074 --> 01:13:11,345
You aren't gonna catch me
letting her run around...

1313
01:13:11,371 --> 01:13:13,965
by herself with guys,
you know, trying to act funny.

1314
01:13:14,115 --> 01:13:15,533
You aren't?

1315
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,243
You wouldn't catch me
marrying anybody...

1316
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:18,969
whose folks let her
act like that either.

1317
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:19,909
You wouldn't?

1318
01:13:19,935 --> 01:13:21,945
Oh, a fella likes to run
around with 'em, maybe...

1319
01:13:21,971 --> 01:13:24,168
just for a good time before
he gets married, but...

1320
01:13:24,194 --> 01:13:27,052
when it comes to settling down,
none of these flappers for me.

1321
01:13:27,078 --> 01:13:29,073
I want a girl I can respect.

1322
01:13:29,099 --> 01:13:32,398
Why, that's funny. That's
what my mother says.

1323
01:13:32,424 --> 01:13:35,030
Believe me, baby, she's right.
I've been around, and I know.

1324
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:38,500
Well, of course it does make a girl
feel awfully good...

1325
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:41,131
to know that her parents
care what she does.

1326
01:13:41,244 --> 01:13:43,149
Sure makes you stop
and think, all right...

1327
01:13:43,175 --> 01:13:46,234
an important man like Mr. Gilbreth
sitting in there all by himself...

1328
01:13:46,311 --> 01:13:48,505
not even dancing, just watching.

1329
01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:52,037
I... I was just about to ask him
to dance when you came over.

1330
01:13:52,063 --> 01:13:53,661
Yeah? Well, come on.

1331
01:13:53,687 --> 01:13:57,789
I guess I can spare one dance. But just
one, you understand. The rest are mine.

1332
01:13:57,815 --> 01:14:00,103
- What about Joe Scales?
- That wet smack?

1333
01:14:00,129 --> 01:14:02,766
After all, he is my date.
What am I gonna do with him?

1334
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:03,969
Throw him back, baby.

1335
01:14:03,995 --> 01:14:06,225
He's too small to keep anyhow.

1336
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:11,857
Look!

1337
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:28,149
I can't believe it.

1338
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:31,498
Well, what do you know?
Say, not bad, either.

1339
01:14:31,524 --> 01:14:33,516
- Come on. Let's dance.
- No, wait a minute.

1340
01:14:33,593 --> 01:14:36,069
I have an idea something
tremendous has happened.

1341
01:14:36,095 --> 01:14:37,110
Yeah? What?

1342
01:14:37,136 --> 01:14:40,272
Oh, you wouldn't understand,
only I guess it's my salvation.

1343
01:14:40,298 --> 01:14:41,370
I don't get it.

1344
01:14:41,396 --> 01:14:44,832
- It's too deep for me.
- I'll tell you someday. Excuse me.

1345
01:14:46,507 --> 01:14:48,770
Excuse me.

1346
01:14:48,842 --> 01:14:51,734
- Excuse me, Dot. May I cut in, please?
- Oh, certainly, Anne.

1347
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,670
I just love dancing with you, Mr. Gilbreth.

1348
01:14:53,696 --> 01:14:54,865
Thank you, young lady.

1349
01:14:54,914 --> 01:14:57,550
Well, I hope you haven't
been too lonely, Dad.

1350
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,260
Oh, no. I've managed.

1351
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:01,984
Funny. I didn't know
you could dance.

1352
01:15:02,056 --> 01:15:04,285
There's lots of things you
don't know, young lady.

1353
01:15:04,357 --> 01:15:06,689
- Maybe you ought to congratulate me.
- What for?

1354
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,991
After all, it isn't every girl
in Montclair High...

1355
01:15:09,063 --> 01:15:11,292
whose father can be
the belle of the ball.

1356
01:15:11,364 --> 01:15:14,976
I wanted to show friends of yours they're
not the only ones who can dance.

1357
01:15:15,002 --> 01:15:17,212
- Your mother and I...
- Okay, Dad. I understand.

1358
01:15:17,238 --> 01:15:20,139
Now, let's be honest. They're
not really bad kids, are they?

1359
01:15:20,258 --> 01:15:22,545
I suppose they're all
right, after their fashion.

1360
01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:26,423
And you're not really gonna tag along
with me every time I go out, are you?

1361
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:28,290
We'll decide that
when I get back.

1362
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:30,648
I won't be able to tag
along while I'm in Europe.

1363
01:15:30,718 --> 01:15:33,023
In Europe? But I thought you
weren't going to Europe.

1364
01:15:33,049 --> 01:15:35,262
Oh, yes. I'm gonna speak in
London as well as Prague.

1365
01:15:35,288 --> 01:15:37,434
- When did you find out?
- The invitation just came.

1366
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:40,365
- Your mother sent it over by Frank.
- Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.

1367
01:15:40,391 --> 01:15:42,538
Now, Anne, dear...
Anne, don't get emotional.

1368
01:15:42,564 --> 01:15:45,499
If you're gonna toddle with me,
by jingo, let's toddle.

1369
01:15:45,568 --> 01:15:49,060
Okay, Dad. Let's go.

1370
01:16:03,051 --> 01:16:05,542
Thank you.

1371
01:16:23,539 --> 01:16:26,030
- Are you sure you have everything, dear?
- I think so.

1372
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:29,046
- Both your speeches?
- Right here in my briefcase.

1373
01:16:29,112 --> 01:16:32,105
- How about your pills?
- Enough to last a lifetime.

1374
01:16:32,182 --> 01:16:34,568
You'd better hurry then.
You haven't much time.

1375
01:16:34,594 --> 01:16:35,937
Be right with you.

1376
01:16:37,922 --> 01:16:40,414
Anne? Ernestine?
Come along, girls.

1377
01:16:40,492 --> 01:16:42,982
- Your father's ready to leave.
<i>- We're coming.</i>

1378
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:45,592
- Frank, you'd better take his suitcases.
- Yes, ma'am.

1379
01:16:45,618 --> 01:16:48,242
Mother, why can't we go
to the station with Daddy?

1380
01:16:48,268 --> 01:16:49,819
Yeah, I wanna see the train.

1381
01:16:49,845 --> 01:16:52,044
When I get back,
I'll show you lots of trains.

1382
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:55,301
But I don't intend to start off to Europe
wringing wet with tears.

1383
01:16:55,372 --> 01:16:57,188
You know how I feel
about good-byes.

1384
01:16:57,261 --> 01:16:58,026
Dad?

1385
01:16:58,052 --> 01:16:59,965
- Yes?
- Here's something for you...

1386
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:02,163
but don't open it till
you get on the boat.

1387
01:17:02,189 --> 01:17:03,137
More socks?

1388
01:17:03,163 --> 01:17:06,025
Whose idea was it for me to learn
to knit in the first place?

1389
01:17:06,051 --> 01:17:09,248
Okay, I plead guilty.
Thank you, dear.

1390
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:14,723
Well, I better get started. Trains don't
wait, you know. Come on, kids. Let's go.

1391
01:17:14,757 --> 01:17:15,888
Come along, children.

1392
01:17:15,914 --> 01:17:19,268
Don't forget to send postcards
from England and Czechoslovakia.

1393
01:17:19,294 --> 01:17:21,663
It won't hurt you kids
to write me now and then either.

1394
01:17:21,689 --> 01:17:24,329
I don't see why we never get
to go on a boat to Europe.

1395
01:17:24,402 --> 01:17:27,041
After all, Dad, they come
cheaper by the dozen.

1396
01:17:27,067 --> 01:17:29,683
Ah, not for Eskimos.

1397
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:31,972
I'll leave the car at the
garage downtown, Lillie.

1398
01:17:32,043 --> 01:17:34,308
This darn carburetor's
acting funny again.

1399
01:17:34,422 --> 01:17:36,653
- They'll send it back.
- Yes, dear.

1400
01:17:36,748 --> 01:17:40,240
Well, good-bye, dear.

1401
01:17:41,088 --> 01:17:43,022
Good-bye, Frank.
Take good care of yourself.

1402
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:47,026
Don't worry about me. And if anything
comes up and you need me, cable me.

1403
01:17:47,094 --> 01:17:50,654
I'll take care of the work here.
You just forget it and enjoy yourself.

1404
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:52,664
I will.

1405
01:17:54,947 --> 01:17:57,056
Come here, young lady.

1406
01:17:57,082 --> 01:18:00,393
You gonna be a good little girl and eat
your spinach for Daddy while I'm gone?

1407
01:18:00,419 --> 01:18:02,249
Make you big and strong.

1408
01:18:02,275 --> 01:18:04,208
And that goes for you too.

1409
01:18:04,276 --> 01:18:06,212
- Good-bye, Lillie.
- Good-bye.

1410
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,213
- Good-bye, girls.
- Good-bye, Daddy.

1411
01:18:08,281 --> 01:18:10,273
- Ernestine.
- Good-bye, Dad.

1412
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:13,480
Anne.
Never mind about you three.

1413
01:18:13,506 --> 01:18:16,182
You children behave yourselves.
Do what your mother tells you.

1414
01:18:16,209 --> 01:18:18,835
I'll be back in a couple of months.
Good-bye, Mr. Chairman.

1415
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:23,319
I guess I can count on you to keep
the bed warm while I'm gone. Ha, ha, ha.

1416
01:18:23,397 --> 01:18:25,332
Mighty fine dog.

1417
01:18:25,717 --> 01:18:27,607
Good-bye. I'm gonna
miss you so much.

1418
01:18:27,633 --> 01:18:30,775
A little more attention to books and a
little less to that swimming champion...

1419
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:33,146
and you'll stand a better chance
of getting into college.

1420
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:35,851
- I'll work on it, Dad.
- That's my girl. Lillie?

1421
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,812
- Good-bye, dearest.
- Good-bye, dear.

1422
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,813
- Have a good time.
- I'll try.

1423
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,315
Bring us some souvenirs, Dad.

1424
01:18:44,337 --> 01:18:46,284
- Take good care of your mother...
- We will.

1425
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,662
And don't forget to write.

1426
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:50,283
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye! Good-bye!

1427
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:52,349
Good-bye!

1428
01:19:05,108 --> 01:19:09,636
Hello? Oh, hello, Dad.
Hey, where are you?

1429
01:19:09,712 --> 01:19:11,703
Yes, sir. She's upstairs.

1430
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:15,410
- Oh. Okay, I'll call her. Hey, Mother!
<i>- Yes?</i>

1431
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:18,715
Dad's on the phone. He forgot somethin.
He wants to talk to ya.

1432
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:22,087
<i>- I'll be right down.</i>
- Okay. She's comin, Dad.

1433
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:26,492
Have a good time, now.
Yes, sir. I will. Good-bye.

1434
01:19:26,563 --> 01:19:30,020
- He's at the Montclair station.
- Thank you, dear.

1435
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,330
- Don't be late for lunch.
- I won't.

1436
01:19:33,404 --> 01:19:35,838
Hello, Frank.

1437
01:19:35,906 --> 01:19:39,466
Hello? Hello?

1438
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:42,841
<i>Hello,</i> Frank.

1439
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:46,279
Operator.

1440
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:49,615
Operator,
are we still connected?

1441
01:19:49,687 --> 01:19:53,214
Well, that's funny.
No one answers.

1442
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:57,249
Hello? Hello?

1443
01:19:57,328 --> 01:19:59,695
Frank?

1444
01:20:00,765 --> 01:20:02,755
Frank!

1445
01:20:11,341 --> 01:20:13,901
- Anne.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Benson.

1446
01:20:13,927 --> 01:20:16,338
Your mother wants you to come
home, dears, right away.

1447
01:20:16,364 --> 01:20:17,697
What is it? What's happened?

1448
01:20:17,723 --> 01:20:21,042
Your father was taken ill at the station.
I'm afraid it's his heart.

1449
01:20:21,118 --> 01:20:23,883
- Is it... Is it bad?
- I don't know how bad, dear.

1450
01:20:23,955 --> 01:20:26,925
Mrs. Monahan said you were shopping
and asked me to find you.

1451
01:20:26,993 --> 01:20:30,018
- Frank's playing ball. Do you know where?
- The school grounds, I guess.

1452
01:20:30,096 --> 01:20:33,087
I said I'd pick him up too.
Come on. Let's get in.

1453
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:50,406
You children better go on in.
I'll park in my driveway.

1454
01:21:02,262 --> 01:21:04,857
How... How is he, Mrs. Monahan?

1455
01:21:04,932 --> 01:21:08,972
Oh, Andy. Our daddy's dead.

1456
01:21:33,495 --> 01:21:35,485
Sit down, children.

1457
01:21:46,442 --> 01:21:48,669
I've called you older
children together because

1458
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:50,597
I think you ought to
know the situation.

1459
01:21:50,645 --> 01:21:53,136
There isn't going to be
a great deal of money.

1460
01:21:53,215 --> 01:21:56,240
Most of it's had to go back
into your father's business.

1461
01:21:56,318 --> 01:21:59,117
I talked by telephone
to your grandmother in California...

1462
01:21:59,188 --> 01:22:02,919
and naturally she wants all of us
to move out there and live with her.

1463
01:22:02,991 --> 01:22:07,520
If it's a matter of money, I plan not to
go to college anyway. I'll get a job.

1464
01:22:07,546 --> 01:22:09,730
I don't want to go to
college either, Mother.

1465
01:22:09,756 --> 01:22:11,350
Wait until I've finished.

1466
01:22:11,376 --> 01:22:12,840
There's an alternative,

1467
01:22:12,866 --> 01:22:15,894
but it hinges on your being able
to take care of yourselves...

1468
01:22:15,938 --> 01:22:18,669
and it will involve
sacrifices from all of us.

1469
01:22:18,695 --> 01:22:21,272
I want you to make the decision.
I can go on

1470
01:22:21,298 --> 01:22:24,102
with your father's work,
keep the office open...

1471
01:22:24,146 --> 01:22:26,637
and that will mean
that we can keep the house.

1472
01:22:26,716 --> 01:22:30,016
We'll have to let Mrs. Monahan go,
and live very simply.

1473
01:22:30,087 --> 01:22:34,218
- We couldn't let Jim Bracken go, could we?
- Oh, he wouldn't go anyway.

1474
01:22:34,292 --> 01:22:37,727
No, I think we can manage
with Jim.

1475
01:22:37,794 --> 01:22:40,522
And if things work out the
way I think they will, Anne,

1476
01:22:40,548 --> 01:22:42,813
you can go to college later on too.

1477
01:22:42,866 --> 01:22:45,474
You know your father wanted
all of you to go to college.

1478
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,233
Don't worry about that, Mother.

1479
01:22:47,585 --> 01:22:49,264
Do you want to try it?

1480
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:51,916
Can you run the house and look
after things until I get back?

1481
01:22:51,943 --> 01:22:54,706
- Get back from where, Mother?
- I'm going to Europe.

1482
01:22:54,778 --> 01:22:58,839
I'm going to give those speeches
for your father in London and Prague.

1483
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:04,479
We all know how much they meant to him, and
I'm sure that's the way he would want it.

1484
01:23:04,555 --> 01:23:08,423
But as I say, the final decision
is up to you.

1485
01:23:08,493 --> 01:23:11,258
Oh, Mother, you don't have to ask us.
Why, you know...

1486
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:13,820
we'll do anything
as long as we can stay together.

1487
01:23:13,898 --> 01:23:18,494
Thank you, dear.
I knew that's the way you'd feel about it.

1488
01:23:18,569 --> 01:23:21,539
Well, since I'm gonna be
planning the meals from now on, I...

1489
01:23:21,607 --> 01:23:23,541
I guess I better get started.

1490
01:23:23,567 --> 01:23:25,288
I'll go over everything
with Mrs. Monahan.

1491
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:26,192
Yes, dear.

1492
01:23:26,218 --> 01:23:29,721
And I'll see the house is kept nicely,
Mother. Just the way you like it.

1493
01:23:29,747 --> 01:23:31,739
- And I'll help her, Mother.
- We all will.

1494
01:23:31,817 --> 01:23:35,310
- Thank you, girls.
- Me too, Mother.

1495
01:23:37,589 --> 01:23:40,821
Maybe Bill and I better go down and see
some used car dealers...

1496
01:23:40,894 --> 01:23:42,827
about sellin
the automobile, Mother.

1497
01:23:42,895 --> 01:23:46,421
You'd better tell them
to bring a tow car.

1498
01:23:46,499 --> 01:23:49,491
You know Foolish Carriage
never starts for anyone but Daddy.

1499
01:23:49,569 --> 01:23:52,902
Yeah, and sometimes
it wouldn't even start for him.

1500
01:23:52,971 --> 01:23:56,998
I'll do all the errands, Mother, and
help Jim. He's getting pretty old.

1501
01:23:57,076 --> 01:23:59,068
That's right.

1502
01:24:04,118 --> 01:24:06,517
- Well, son?
- Yes, Mother.

1503
01:24:07,887 --> 01:24:10,856
From now on, you'll have to be
the man of the family.

1504
01:24:10,924 --> 01:24:13,017
Sure, Mother.
We'll handle things.

1505
01:24:13,094 --> 01:24:16,529
And we'll do a good job too.
You wait and see.

1506
01:24:16,597 --> 01:24:19,532
Yes, son.

1507
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,533
I know you will.

1508
01:24:21,602 --> 01:24:25,094
Anyhow, that's one man's opinion.

1509
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:18,090
<i>Yes, Dad, Gilbreth and Company will go on.</i>

1510
01:25:18,161 --> 01:25:21,028
<i>Mother and your even dozen</i>
<i>will see to that.</i>

1511
01:25:21,097 --> 01:25:23,326
<i>Mother will go to Europe,</i>
<i>and you'll be proud...</i>

1512
01:25:23,398 --> 01:25:27,062
<i>of the way she delivers</i>
<i>those speeches for you.</i>

1513
01:25:29,405 --> 01:25:32,375
<i>And she'll go right on,</i>
<i>following in your footsteps...</i>

1514
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:37,469
<i>to become the foremost woman industrial</i>
<i>engineer in the world and, by 1948...</i>

1515
01:25:37,547 --> 01:25:40,881
<i>America's Woman of the Year.</i>

1516
01:25:40,952 --> 01:25:46,184
<i>But wherever you are,</i>
<i>Dad, somehow I'm sure you know that...</i>

1517
01:25:46,256 --> 01:25:49,248
<i>and never doubted it</i>
<i>for a moment.</i>
