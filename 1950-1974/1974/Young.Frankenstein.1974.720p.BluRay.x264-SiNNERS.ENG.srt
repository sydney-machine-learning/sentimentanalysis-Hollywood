1
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:13,493
If we look at the base of a brain
which has just been removed from a skull,

2
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:17,747
there's very little of the midbrain
that we can actually see.

3
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,084
Yet, as I demonstrated
in my lecture last week,

4
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:27,299
if the under aspects of the temporal lobes
are gently pulled apart,

5
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:32,179
the upper portion of the stem
of the brain can be seen.

6
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,685
This so-called brainstem
consists of the midbrain,

7
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:43,232
a rounded protrusion called the pons,

8
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:48,446
and a stalk tapering downwards
called the medulla oblongata

9
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:52,325
which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum

10
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,537
and becomes, of course, the spinal cord.

11
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:58,957
Are there any questions before we proceed?

12
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:01,376
I have one question, Dr Frankenstein.

13
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,381
That's Fronkonsteen.

14
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:08,466
I beg your pardon?

15
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,387
My name. It's pronounced "Fronkonsteen".

16
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:16,309
But aren't you the grandson
of the famous Dr Victor Frankenstein,

17
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:21,397
who dug up freshly buried corpses
and transformed dead components into...

18
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:23,149
Yes, yes.

19
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:24,358
Yes.

20
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:26,527
We all know what he did.

21
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:32,199
But I'd rather be remembered
for my own small contributions to science

22
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,662
and not because of my accidental
relationship

23
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:40,082
to a famous... cuckoo.

24
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:46,757
Now, if you don't mind,
can we have your question?

25
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:50,594
Well, sir, I'm not sure
I understand the distinction between

26
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,388
reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses.

27
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:57,684
Good. Since our lab work today
is a demonstration of just that distinction,

28
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:00,270
why don't we proceed?

29
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:12,951
Mr Hilltop here,
with whom I have never worked

30
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:15,912
or given any prior instructions to,

31
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:19,958
has graciously offered his services
for today's demonstration.

32
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:25,004
Mr Hilltop, would you hop up on your feet
and stand beside this table?

33
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,892
Nice hopping.

34
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:41,105
Mr Hilltop,

35
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:46,360
would you raise your left knee, please?

36
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:52,741
You have just witnessed
a voluntary nerve impulse.

37
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,911
It begins as a stimulus
from the cerebral cortex,

38
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:59,499
passes through the brainstem
and to the muscles involved.

39
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:01,876
Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee.

40
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:07,215
Reflex movements are those
which are made independently of the will,

41
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,551
but are carried out along pathways

42
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:14,139
which pass between the peripheral nervous
system and the central nervous system.

43
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:17,517
You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch.

44
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:20,353
We are not aware of these impulses.

45
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,357
Neither do we intend them
to carry out our contraction of muscles.

46
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,944
Yet, as you can see, they work by themselves.

47
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:31,365
But what if we block the nerve impulse
by simply applying local pressure,

48
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,493
which can be done
with any ordinary metal clamp

49
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:39,081
just at the swelling
on the posterior nerve roots

50
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,086
for, say... five or six seconds?

51
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,302
Why, you mother-grabbing bastard.

52
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:55,515
As you can see,
all communication is shut off.

53
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:01,813
In spite of our mechanical magnificence,

54
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:07,527
if it were not for this continuous stream
of motor impulses,

55
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:09,696
we would collapse

56
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:13,158
like a bunch of broccoli.

57
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:20,875
In conclusion, it should be noted...

58
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:24,420
- Give him an extra dollar.
- Extra dollar. Yes, sir.

59
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,465
...that any more than common injury

60
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:30,301
to the nerve root is always serious.

61
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,263
Because once a nerve fibre is severed,

62
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:37,850
there is no way, in heaven or on earth,

63
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:41,688
to regenerate life back into it.

64
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:44,733
Are there any last questions before we leave?

65
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:46,819
Dr Frank...

66
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:49,321
- Fronkonsteen...
- Yes?

67
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:53,826
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass case

68
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:56,161
until, by some extraordinary means,

69
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:59,873
it actually began to move
with a voluntary motion?

70
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:04,336
Are you speaking of the worm
or the spaghetti?

71
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:07,798
Why, the worm, sir.

72
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:12,470
Yes. It seems to me I did read something
of that incident when I was a student.

73
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:16,182
But you have to remember that a worm,
with very few exceptions,

74
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:19,311
is not a human being.

75
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:23,356
But wasn't that the basis
of your grandfather's work, sir?

76
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:25,525
The reanimation of dead tissue?

77
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,237
My grandfather was a very sick man.

78
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:33,575
But as a Fronkonsteen,
aren't you the least bit curious about it?

79
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,080
Doesn't bringing back to life what was
once dead hold any intrigue for you?

80
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:44,795
You are talking about the nonsensical ravings
of a lunatic mind. Dead is dead.

81
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,757
But look at what has been done
with hearts and kidneys.

82
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,346
Hearts and kidneys are Tinkertoys.
I'm talking about the central nervous system.

83
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:56,807
- But, sir...
- I am a scientist, not a philosopher!

84
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:59,727
You have more chance
of reanimating this scalpel

85
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,063
than of mending a broken nervous system.

86
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:07,110
- But what about your grandfather's work?
- My grandfather's work was doo-doo!

87
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:11,114
I am not interested in death.

88
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:14,952
The only thing that concerns me
is the preservation of life!

89
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:24,795
Class...

90
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,630
...is...

91
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:28,758
...dismissed.

92
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:39,769
Dr Frankenstein...

93
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:43,398
That's Fronkonsteen.

94
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:49,362
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

95
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:54,910
I have travelled 5,000 miles to bring you
the will of your great-grandfather.

96
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:59,707
Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein.

97
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,681
Oh, my sweet darling.

98
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:19,852
Oh, my dearest love.
I'll count the hours that you're away.

99
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:23,857
- Oh, darling, so will I.
- Not on the lips.

100
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:28,361
I'm going to that party at Nanna and Nicky's.
I don't wanna smear my lipstick.

101
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,196
- You understand.
- Of course.

102
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,823
All aboard!

103
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:35,493
- Oh, dear.
- Well, I guess this is it.

104
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,579
Freddy, darling.

105
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:42,000
Oh, how can I say in a few minutes
what it's taken me a lifetime to understand?

106
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,127
- Won't you try?
- All right.

107
00:12:45,086 --> 00:12:47,131
You've got it, mister.

108
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:51,218
I'm yours. All of me. What else can I say?

109
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:54,513
- My sweet love...
- The hair. Just been set.

110
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,599
Sorry.

111
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:01,854
- I hope you like old-fashioned weddings.
- I prefer old-fashioned wedding nights.

112
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:05,608
- You're incorrigible.
- Does that mean...

113
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:10,738
...you love me?
- You bet your boots it does.

114
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:14,451
- Oh, my only love.
- Taffeta, darling.

115
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,870
Taffeta, sweetheart.

116
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:21,500
No, the dress is taffeta. It wrinkles so easily.

117
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,085
All aboard!

118
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,420
There's that horrid man again.

119
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:28,465
Well, hurry now,
before I make a fool of myself.

120
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:30,592
Oh, my nails!

121
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:32,761
Sorry.

122
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,772
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Freddy.

123
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:49,904
Darling.

124
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:16,724
- Harry, he was at it again.
- So what do you want me to do about it?

125
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:18,309
Every day.

126
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,185
Let him. Let him.

127
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:24,106
New York next. Everybody out for New York.

128
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:54,262
Pardon me, boy.
Is this the Transylvania Station?

129
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,641
<i>Ja, ja.</i> Track 29.

130
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:01,228
Oh, can I give you a shine?

131
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:04,815
No, thanks.

132
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:34,221
Dr Frankenstein?

133
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:40,978
Fronkonsteen.

134
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:44,982
You're putting me on.

135
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,401
No. It's pronounced Fronkonsteen.

136
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,738
Do you also say Frodorick?

137
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:52,907
No. Frederick.

138
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:56,202
Well, why isn't it Frodorick Fronkonsteen?

139
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:58,913
It isn't. It's Frederick Fronkonsteen.

140
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:01,291
I see.

141
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,919
- You must be lgor.
- No. It's pronounced I-gor.

142
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:10,633
- But they told me it was lgor.
- Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?

143
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:14,137
You were sent by <i>Herr</i> Falkstein, weren't you?

144
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:18,225
Yes. My grandfather
used to work for your grandfather.

145
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:24,273
- How nice.
- Of course, the rates have gone up.

146
00:16:24,356 --> 00:16:28,068
Of course. I'm sure we'll get along splendidly.

147
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:32,281
Sorry. I...

148
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:37,244
You know, I don't mean to embarrass you,
but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.

149
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:39,830
Perhaps I could help you with that hump.

150
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,999
What hump?

151
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,590
Let's go.

152
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:51,843
Allow me, master.

153
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:54,012
Thanks very much.

154
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,352
Walk this way.

155
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,230
This way.

156
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,127
I think you'll be more comfortable in the rear.

157
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,844
- What was that?
- That'll be Inga.

158
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,266
<i>Herr</i> Falkstein thought you might need
a laboratory assistant temporarily.

159
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:46,191
Hello.
Would you like to have a roll in the hay?

160
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,236
It's fun.

161
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,864
Roll, roll, roll in the hay

162
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,433
Sometimes I am afraid of the lightning.

163
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:20,935
It's just an atmospheric discharge.

164
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,104
Nothing to be afraid of.

165
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,571
Werewolf.

166
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:32,740
Werewolf?

167
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:34,908
- There.
- What?

168
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:37,828
There wolf.

169
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:39,997
There castle.

170
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:42,166
Why are you talking that way?

171
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,210
- I thought you wanted to.
- No, I don't want to.

172
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,213
Suit yourself. I'm easy.

173
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:53,052
Well...

174
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:54,929
There it is.

175
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:57,057
Home.

176
00:19:29,507 --> 00:19:31,717
What knockers.

177
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:34,845
Thank you, Doctor.

178
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:37,431
Oh, that's all right.

179
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:40,226
There we are.

180
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:55,659
I am <i>Frau</i> Blücher.

181
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:01,999
Steady!

182
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,253
How do you do? I am Dr Fronkonsteen.

183
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:10,007
This is my assistant.
Inga, may I present <i>Frau</i> Blücher?

184
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:16,389
I wonder what's got into them.

185
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:21,102
Your rooms have been prepared, <i>Herr Doktor.</i>

186
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:23,896
If you will follow me.

187
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,066
I-gor. Would you bring the bags
as soon as you're finished, please?

188
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:28,651
Yes, master.

189
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:31,237
After you, <i>Frau</i> Blücher.

190
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,422
Blücher!

191
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:07,734
Follow me, please.

192
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:30,840
Stay close to the candles.

193
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:34,553
The staircase can be treacherous.

194
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:47,650
<i>Und</i> this is your room.
It was your grandfather Victor's room.

195
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:49,819
I see.

196
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,197
Well. Seem to be quite a few books.

197
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:55,408
This was Victor's...

198
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:59,037
...the Baron's medical library.

199
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:03,333
- Where is my grandfather's private library?
- I don't know what you mean, sir.

200
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:07,587
Well, these books are very general.
Any doctor might have them in his study.

201
00:22:07,713 --> 00:22:11,842
This is the only library I know of,
Dr Frankenstone.

202
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:15,178
- Fronkonsteen.
- Fronkonsteen.

203
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:18,432
Well, we'll see.

204
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:21,393
Good night.

205
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,233
Would the doctor care for
a brandy before retiring?

206
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:30,862
No. Thank you.

207
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:35,074
Some warm milk...

208
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:37,994
...perhaps?

209
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:41,581
No, thank you very much.

210
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:43,833
No, thanks.

211
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,960
Ovaltine?

212
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:52,134
Nothing.

213
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:54,053
Thank you.

214
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:56,555
I'm a little tired.

215
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:01,602
Then I will say... good night.

216
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:03,771
Good night!

217
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:22,916
Good night, darling.

218
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:28,505
Good night, <i>Herr Doktor.</i>

219
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,007
Good night, <i>Frau</i> Blücher.

220
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:54,657
No, no, no...

221
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:58,619
No, no, no...

222
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,418
I'm not a Frankenstein.

223
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:08,922
I am not a Frankenstein.

224
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,426
I'm a Fronkonsteen.

225
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,262
Don't gimme that!

226
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,140
I don't believe in fate.

227
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,934
And I won't say it.

228
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:24,896
All right, you win. I give.

229
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,607
I'll say it. I'll say it, I'll say it.

230
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:31,862
Destiny. Destiny.

231
00:24:32,446 --> 00:24:34,824
No escaping that for me.

232
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:37,076
Destiny. Destiny.

233
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:39,537
No escaping that for me.

234
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:41,873
Destiny. Destiny...

235
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:44,000
No escaping...

236
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,296
Dr Fronkonsteen. Wake up.

237
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,842
- What is it?
- You were having a nightmare.

238
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:57,847
- What's that strange music?
- I have no idea.

239
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:01,226
But it seems to be coming

240
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:04,813
from behind the bookcase.

241
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:08,984
Behind the bookcase...

242
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:12,863
Hand me that robe, would you, dear?

243
00:25:17,701 --> 00:25:20,954
You were right.
It's coming from behind this wall.

244
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:23,332
Where is it?

245
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:25,417
- Where is it?
- What?

246
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:29,631
There's always a device.
If I can just spot the triggering mechanism...

247
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:31,758
Hello.

248
00:25:42,185 --> 00:25:46,314
It seems louder over here.
Hand me that candle, will you?

249
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:53,990
Put the candle back.

250
00:26:00,204 --> 00:26:04,333
All right. I think I have it figured out now.

251
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:09,839
Take out the candle
and I'll block the bookcase with my body.

252
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:23,020
Listen to me very carefully.

253
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:26,356
Don't put the candle back.

254
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,900
With all of your might,

255
00:26:29,026 --> 00:26:32,821
shove against the other side
of the bookcase.

256
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:35,907
Is that perfectly clear?

257
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,202
I think so.

258
00:26:47,754 --> 00:26:49,797
Good girl.

259
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:54,010
Put the candle back.

260
00:27:01,392 --> 00:27:03,895
Oh, look, Doctor. A passageway.

261
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,106
Whatever that music is,
it's coming from down there.

262
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,818
- I'd better take a look.
- Oh, let me come with you, Doctor, please.

263
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:12,988
I don't wanna stay up here alone.

264
00:27:13,113 --> 00:27:16,116
All right, then.
Close your robe and follow me.

265
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:18,285
Oh, Doctor. The candle...

266
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,789
Good thinking. Let's try this one.

267
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:25,125
Stand back!

268
00:27:58,451 --> 00:28:00,912
Don't be frightened, dear. Just a rat.

269
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:04,124
A filthy, slimy rat.

270
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:42,205
Good Lord!

271
00:29:01,768 --> 00:29:03,478
I-I-I-I-I-I

272
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:05,938
Ain't got nobody

273
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:09,484
And nobody cares for me

274
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:12,487
- I-gor.
- Frodorick.

275
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,614
How did you get here?

276
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,203
Through the dumbwaiter. I heard
strange music from the upstairs kitchen

277
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:22,622
and I just followed it down.

278
00:29:22,748 --> 00:29:25,834
Call it... a hunch.

279
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:30,506
- There must have been someone else here.
- It would seem that way.

280
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:33,425
And there's the only other door.

281
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,594
Wait, master.

282
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,763
It might be dangerous.

283
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:40,683
You go first.

284
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,531
Aren't there any lights in this place?

285
00:29:55,615 --> 00:30:00,245
Two nasty-looking switches over here,
but I'm not going to be the first.

286
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,460
Damn your eyes.

287
00:30:07,585 --> 00:30:09,629
Too late.

288
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:25,563
So this is where it all happened.

289
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:41,496
<i>Just think. A dead brain</i>
<i>ready to live again in a new body.</i>

290
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:45,125
<i>Look. No blood, no decomposition.</i>

291
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,252
<i>Just a few sutures.</i>

292
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:50,047
- <i>Throw the main switch.</i>
- <i>Yes, master.</i>

293
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:59,222
What a filthy mess.

294
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:03,143
I dunno. A little paint, a few flowers,
couple of throw pillows...

295
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,944
Well, it seems as if our mysterious violinist
has disa... p...

296
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,822
- Disa... what?
...peared.

297
00:31:14,947 --> 00:31:18,660
There is a light
coming from behind that door.

298
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,122
Follow me.

299
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,987
Doctor, look!

300
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:58,492
Well... This explains the music.

301
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:02,038
It's still warm.

302
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:04,124
But who was playing it?

303
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:05,792
I don't know.

304
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:09,713
But whoever it was just barely finished
putting out his cigar.

305
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:12,507
Such strange goings-on.

306
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:17,012
What is this place?

307
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:19,597
Music room?

308
00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:22,726
But there's nothing here
but books and papers.

309
00:32:23,268 --> 00:32:25,312
Books and papers?

310
00:32:26,188 --> 00:32:27,648
It is!

311
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:31,110
This is my grandfather's private library.
I feel it.

312
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,613
Look! Look at this.

313
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:54,051
"...until, from the midst of this
darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me."

314
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:59,556
"A light so brilliant and wondrous,
and yet so simple."

315
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:03,185
"Change the poles from plus to minus

316
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:07,189
and from minus to plus."

317
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:15,238
"I alone succeeded in discovering
the secret of bestowing life."

318
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,783
"Nay, even more..."

319
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:23,164
"I myself became capable
of bestowing animation

320
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,417
upon lifeless matter."

321
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:36,886
It could work.

322
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:57,157
- Kipper?
- Thank you, Doctor.

323
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,166
"As the minuteness of the parts
formed a hindrance to my speed,

324
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:11,923
I resolved therefore
to make the creature of a gigantic stature."

325
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,261
Of course.

326
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:18,513
That would simplify everything.

327
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:20,265
In other words,

328
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:25,228
his veins, his feet, his hands, his organs
would all have to be increased in size.

329
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,272
Exactly.

330
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:30,900
He would have an enormous <i>Schwanzstück.</i>

331
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:39,076
That goes without saying.

332
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,661
Woof.

333
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,165
He's gonna be very popular.

334
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:50,546
So then. What we're aiming for is a being
approximately seven feet in height,

335
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:55,593
with all features either congenitally
or artificially proportionate in size.

336
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,595
Something like...

337
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,181
...this?

338
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,188
Hello...

339
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,357
You've caught something there.

340
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:12,069
Crude, yes, primitive, yes,
perhaps even grotesque,

341
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,946
yet something inexplicable tells me

342
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:20,118
that this might be our man.

343
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,304
All right, all right.

344
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:40,932
That's good enough for the likes of 'im.

345
00:35:57,992 --> 00:36:00,035
Get down, you fool.

346
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,504
Now.

347
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:41,578
What a filthy job.

348
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:44,372
- Could be worse.
- How?

349
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:46,541
Could be raining.

350
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:36,009
Quick.

351
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,350
Need a hand?

352
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:46,020
No, thanks. I have one.
Thanks very much all the same.

353
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:47,855
Just a moment, sir.

354
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:51,776
I know everyone around here,
but I've never seen your face before.

355
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,945
Can you account for yourself?

356
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,199
Yes. I am Dr Frederick Fronkonsteen,
newly arrived from America.

357
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,994
Oh, yes, sir. I was told you were here.

358
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,372
Well, I'm Constable Henry, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

359
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:08,502
How very nice to meet you, Constable.

360
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:11,630
Why, you're chilled to the bone, sir.

361
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:14,758
A nice, warm fire would be the thing for you.

362
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:18,303
A little nip from the old bottle
wouldn't be too bad either, sir.

363
00:38:18,387 --> 00:38:20,639
That's the ticket, yes.

364
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:24,309
Well, if you have everything in hand, sir,
I'll say good night.

365
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,478
Thank you very much, Constable.

366
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:29,606
At your service, sir, always.

367
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:34,279
- Good night, Constable.
- Good night, sir.

368
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:54,549
Oh, what an awesome sight.

369
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,680
What a profound and reverend night is this.

370
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:03,351
With such a specimen for a body,

371
00:39:03,976 --> 00:39:08,356
all we need now is
an equally magnificent brain.

372
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:13,277
- You know what to do?
- I have a pretty good idea.

373
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:15,446
Good man.

374
00:39:16,155 --> 00:39:19,492
Didn't you... Didn't you use to have that
on the other side?

375
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:21,661
- What?
- Your...

376
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,664
Never mind.

377
00:39:28,377 --> 00:39:32,005
- Do you have that name I gave you?
- I have it written down.

378
00:39:33,215 --> 00:39:37,594
- H Delbruck.
- Hans Delbruck.

379
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:34,048
- He is hideous.
- He's beautiful.

380
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:38,679
And he is mine.

381
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:49,523
Hurry now.
We're fighting time and the elements.

382
00:41:49,648 --> 00:41:53,694
- Are you ready?
- Are you sure this is how they did it?

383
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:56,405
Yes. It's all written down in the notes.

384
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,616
Now tie off the kites
and hurry down as fast as you can.

385
00:41:59,741 --> 00:42:01,201
What's the hurry?

386
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:05,248
There's a possibility of electrocution.
Do you understand?

387
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:12,964
I say: "There's a possibility of electrocution."

388
00:42:13,548 --> 00:42:15,967
Do you understand?

389
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:19,095
I understand, I understand.
Why are you shouting?

390
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,931
Did you...

391
00:42:22,932 --> 00:42:25,852
- Did you tie off the kites?
- Of course.

392
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:29,231
All right. Good.

393
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:34,361
- Check the generator.
- Yes, master.

394
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:43,370
I-gor,

395
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:46,915
- release the safety valve on the main wheel.
- Yes, master.

396
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:57,552
Can you imagine the brain
of Hans Delbruck in this body?

397
00:42:57,635 --> 00:42:59,596
Oh, Frederick.

398
00:43:00,138 --> 00:43:02,182
This is the moment.

399
00:43:03,183 --> 00:43:05,226
Well, dear...

400
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:07,395
Are you ready?

401
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,564
Yes, Doctor.

402
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:13,068
Elevate me.

403
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:15,862
Now? Right here?

404
00:43:17,697 --> 00:43:21,494
- Yes, yes. Raise the platform.
- Oh, the platform.

405
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:23,871
Oh, that. <i>Ja...</i> yes.

406
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:47,604
From that fateful day
when stinking bits of slime

407
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:52,401
first crawled from the sea
and shouted to the cold stars:

408
00:43:53,026 --> 00:43:55,696
"I am man",

409
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:01,743
our greatest dread has always been
the knowledge of our own mortality.

410
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:04,579
But tonight

411
00:44:04,705 --> 00:44:07,457
we shall hurl the gauntlet of science

412
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:11,169
into the frightful face of death itself.

413
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:15,591
Tonight,

414
00:44:15,842 --> 00:44:19,762
we shall ascend into the heavens.

415
00:44:20,388 --> 00:44:23,307
We shall mock the earthquake.

416
00:44:24,017 --> 00:44:26,561
We shall command the thunders

417
00:44:27,395 --> 00:44:29,439
and penetrate

418
00:44:29,564 --> 00:44:36,195
into the very womb
of impervious nature herself.

419
00:44:44,496 --> 00:44:48,250
When I give the word,
throw the first switch.

420
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:50,836
You've got it, master.

421
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:57,009
Get ready.

422
00:44:59,928 --> 00:45:01,889
Get set.

423
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:03,766
Go!

424
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,025
Throw the second switch.

425
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,199
Throw the third switch.

426
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:21,743
Not the third switch?

427
00:45:21,868 --> 00:45:24,954
Throw it, I say. Throw it!

428
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,011
Life.

429
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,722
Life, do you hear me?

430
00:45:41,847 --> 00:45:43,891
Give my creation

431
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:47,103
life!

432
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:11,753
Turn everything off and bring me down.

433
00:47:21,826 --> 00:47:23,870
Nothing.

434
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:26,831
- Oh, Doctor. I'm sorry...
- No, no.

435
00:47:27,665 --> 00:47:30,502
Be of good cheer.

436
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:33,505
If science teaches us anything,

437
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:37,133
it teaches us to accept our failures

438
00:47:37,258 --> 00:47:39,761
as well as our successes

439
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:43,891
with quiet dignity

440
00:47:45,393 --> 00:47:47,687
and grace.

441
00:47:57,905 --> 00:48:00,449
Son of a bitch, bastard. I'll get you for this.

442
00:48:00,574 --> 00:48:02,618
What did you do to me?

443
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:06,455
- What did you do to me?
- Doctor, stop it!

444
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,457
You'll kill him!

445
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:11,503
I don't wanna live.

446
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:14,965
I do not want to live.

447
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:19,928
Quiet dignity and grace.

448
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:23,015
Mama!

449
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:28,145
Oh, tosh! This man is different, I tell you.

450
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,024
You can see that after you've
talked to him for five minutes.

451
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:35,695
Yes?

452
00:48:37,238 --> 00:48:39,282
He's a Frankenstein!

453
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:42,660
And they're all alike.

454
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:45,872
It's in their blood. They can't 'elp it.

455
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:49,083
All those scientists, they're all alike.

456
00:48:49,834 --> 00:48:51,878
They say they're working for us.

457
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:56,257
What they really want is to rule the world.

458
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:07,186
That's enough now. I will not have
this meeting become a free-for-all.

459
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:10,105
These are very serious charges
you're making,

460
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:15,277
and all the more painful to us, your elders,
because we still have nightmares

461
00:49:15,402 --> 00:49:18,072
from five times before.

462
00:49:18,864 --> 00:49:25,037
Now, we haven't heard from the one man
most qualified to judge the situation fairly.

463
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,708
Inspector Kemp.

464
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:32,212
Will you talk to us, please?

465
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:03,577
A riot is an ugly thing

466
00:50:03,703 --> 00:50:08,082
<i>und</i> once you get one started

467
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:11,293
there is little chance of stopping it

468
00:50:12,086 --> 00:50:14,547
short of bloodshed.

469
00:50:15,506 --> 00:50:20,721
I think before we go around killing people,

470
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:26,476
we had better make damn sure
of our evidence.

471
00:50:27,978 --> 00:50:30,022
<i>Und...</i>

472
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:37,779
...we had better confirm the fact

473
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:41,950
that young Frankenstein is indeed

474
00:50:42,034 --> 00:50:45,203
vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps.

475
00:50:45,328 --> 00:50:46,455
What?

476
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:49,584
Vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps.
Vootstaps.

477
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:51,127
Oh, footsteps.

478
00:50:51,252 --> 00:50:53,296
I think

479
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:55,715
what is in order

480
00:50:57,633 --> 00:51:02,597
is for me to pay a little visit
on the good doctor

481
00:51:03,222 --> 00:51:08,978
<i>und</i> to have a nice, quiet chat.

482

483
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:18,197
Reputation.

484
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:22,534
Oh, Doctor. You mustn't do this to yourself.

485
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,038
You've got to stop thinking about it.

486
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:29,708
Why, look.
You haven't even touched your food.

487
00:51:31,794 --> 00:51:33,170
There.

488
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:36,924
Now I've touched it. Happy?

489
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:41,763
You know... I'll never forget my old dad.

490
00:51:42,764 --> 00:51:47,644
When these things would happen to him...
the things he'd say to me.

491
00:51:49,187 --> 00:51:51,231
What did he say?

492
00:51:51,314 --> 00:51:54,401
What the hell are you doin'
in the bathroom day and night?

493
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:58,071
Why don't you get outta there
and give someone else a chance?

494
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:07,540
Oh, maybe it's better this way.

495
00:52:07,665 --> 00:52:10,167
The poor lifeless hulk.

496
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:13,295
Maybe it is better off dead.

497
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,151
What is this?

498
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,278
<i>Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.</i>

499
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:43,577
Do you like it? I'm not partial to
desserts myself, but this is excellent.

500
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,163
Who are you talking to?

501
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,959
To you. You just made a yummy sound,
so I thought you liked the dessert.

502
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,254
I didn't make a yummy sound.
I just asked you what it is.

503
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,592
- But you did. I just heard it.
- It wasn't me.

504
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,719
It wasn't me.

505
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:03,556
Well, now, look here.
If it wasn't you and it wasn't you...

506
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,416
Alive. It's alive.

507
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:32,878
It's alive!

508
00:53:35,506 --> 00:53:37,800
Stand back.

509
00:53:45,224 --> 00:53:47,893
Hello, there.

510
00:53:47,976 --> 00:53:51,064
I'm going to set you free.

511
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,027
- Is the sedative ready?
- Yes, Doctor.

512
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:12,502
I want you

513
00:54:13,294 --> 00:54:16,215
to sit up.

514
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:34,442
Stand on your feet.

515
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:41,115
You can do it.

516
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,670
Now walk.

517
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:03,138
Doctor, I'm frightened.

518
00:55:03,263 --> 00:55:05,390
Don't worry.

519
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:10,104
Good.

520
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:14,025
Good.

521
00:55:15,651 --> 00:55:17,987
What is it? What's the matter?

522
00:55:18,112 --> 00:55:20,698
Quick. Give him the...

523
00:55:20,823 --> 00:55:22,200
Quick. Give him the...

524
00:55:22,325 --> 00:55:24,577
What? Give him the what?

525
00:55:25,328 --> 00:55:28,831
Three syllables.
First syllable - sounds like...

526
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:31,292
Head. Sounds like head.

527
00:55:31,709 --> 00:55:33,753
Bed... Said...

528
00:55:34,212 --> 00:55:35,672
Said.

529
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:37,257
- Said.
- Said.

530
00:55:37,383 --> 00:55:39,385
Second syllable - little word.

531
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,136
This, that, the...

532
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:42,971
A...

533
00:55:43,514 --> 00:55:45,557
- Said a...
- Said a...

534
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:48,185
Dirty word. He said a dirty word.

535
00:55:48,977 --> 00:55:51,021
Sounds like...

536
00:55:51,146 --> 00:55:53,190
To give. Give.

537
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,276
Said... Said a give... Give him a said a give.

538
00:55:57,069 --> 00:55:59,905
Oh, tive... tive... Sedative.

539
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,075
On the nosey.

540
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,888
Said a give?

541
00:56:31,981 --> 00:56:34,650
Oh, Frederick. Are you all right?

542
00:56:34,775 --> 00:56:36,944
Yes.

543
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:41,657
- Would you excuse me for one minute, dear?
- Of course, Doctor.

544
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:44,285
I-gor...

545
00:56:45,244 --> 00:56:48,080
- May I speak to you for a moment?
- Of course.

546
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,332
- Sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.

547
00:56:53,712 --> 00:56:55,589
No, no. Up here.

548
00:56:56,173 --> 00:56:58,050
Thank you.

549
00:57:02,262 --> 00:57:05,348
Now, that brain that you gave me...

550
00:57:06,224 --> 00:57:08,977
Was it Hans Delbruck's?

551
00:57:10,979 --> 00:57:13,482
- No.
- Good.

552
00:57:15,609 --> 00:57:17,152
Would you mind telling me...

553
00:57:19,154 --> 00:57:23,284
...whose brain I did put in?

554
00:57:23,368 --> 00:57:28,164
- Then you won't be angry?
- I will not be angry.

555
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:31,000
Abby someone.

556
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,878
Abby someone...

557
00:57:34,003 --> 00:57:36,672
- Abby who?
- Abby Normal.

558
00:57:39,384 --> 00:57:41,636
Abby Normal...

559
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:44,222
I'm almost sure that was the name.

560
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:52,940
Are you saying that I put an abnormal brain

561
00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:57,319
into a seven-and-a-half-foot long,

562
00:57:58,445 --> 00:58:01,615
54-inch wide

563
00:58:03,492 --> 00:58:05,536
gorilla?

564
00:58:06,161 --> 00:58:08,914
Is that what you're telling me?

565
00:58:09,373 --> 00:58:11,333
Quick, quick. Give him the...

566
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:13,336
What?

567
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:15,505
Three syllables, yes.

568
00:58:16,881 --> 00:58:19,008
I wonder who that could be at this hour.

569
00:58:25,473 --> 00:58:28,810
Inga, quick. See who that is.

570
00:58:29,018 --> 00:58:33,815
You... put that thing
back on the operating table.

571
00:58:34,858 --> 00:58:38,195
And strap him down tightly.

572
00:58:39,572 --> 00:58:42,658
- Where are you going?
- To wash up. I've got to look normal.

573
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:45,119
We've all of us got to behave normally.

574
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:49,999
Monsters!

575
00:58:55,046 --> 00:58:57,006
Excellent shot.

576
00:58:57,131 --> 00:59:01,761
This is the 20th century, Kemp.
Monsters are passé like ghosts and goblins.

577
00:59:01,844 --> 00:59:06,141
Not to the good people
of this village, <i>Herr Doktor.</i>

578
00:59:07,768 --> 00:59:09,311
To them

579
00:59:09,394 --> 00:59:12,397
he is a very real thing.

580
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:18,987
Especially when...
there is a Frankenstein residing in this house.

581
00:59:33,878 --> 00:59:35,963
Nice grouping.

582
00:59:36,089 --> 00:59:38,132
Thank you.

583
00:59:40,593 --> 00:59:46,516
I wouldn't think an intelligent fellow like you
would fall for all this superstitious rot.

584
00:59:47,475 --> 00:59:52,230
It is not superstition that worries me,
<i>Herr Doktor,</i> but genes <i>und</i>

585
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:54,399
chromosomes.

586
00:59:55,316 --> 00:59:58,570
- Rubbish.
- Well, you might say, but this is

587
00:59:59,113 --> 01:00:00,656
Transylvania.

588
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:04,868
<i>Und</i> you are a

589
01:00:04,952 --> 01:00:06,328
Frankenstein.

590
01:00:09,248 --> 01:00:14,461
You... seem unusually upset
by this discussion.

591
01:00:14,586 --> 01:00:16,630
Not in the least.

592
01:00:17,464 --> 01:00:19,675
I find it extremely amusing, that's all.

593
01:00:22,553 --> 01:00:24,347
Well, this was fun.

594
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:27,308
Now, if you don't mind, Inspector,
I'm a little tired.

595
01:00:27,434 --> 01:00:28,601
Then

596
01:00:28,727 --> 01:00:32,105
I may give the villagers
your complete assurance

597
01:00:32,772 --> 01:00:38,445
that you have no interest whatsoever
in carrying on your grandfather's work?

598
01:00:41,573 --> 01:00:43,616
May I take that for a yes?

599
01:00:45,368 --> 01:00:47,078
Very well.

600
01:00:47,203 --> 01:00:50,374
- You can find the way out by yourself?
- Of course.

601
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:56,130
Until we meet again... <i>Herr Baron.</i>

602
01:00:56,213 --> 01:00:58,799
Yes. Drop by any time. We are always open.

603
01:01:41,886 --> 01:01:43,930
Oh, Victor.

604
01:01:44,597 --> 01:01:46,307
Victor...

605
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:48,810
We have done it.

606
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,690
I'm going to set you free.

607
01:01:54,816 --> 01:01:57,985
Would you like that, <i>meine Seuchekopf?</i>

608
01:02:07,788 --> 01:02:09,832
They wanted to hurt you.

609
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:12,918
But I'm going to help you.

610
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:16,588
Thank heavens that's over with.

611
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:19,633
<i>Frau</i> Blücher.

612
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:24,054
Stop. Don't come closer.

613
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:27,266
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to set him free.

614
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:29,435
No. No, you mustn't.

615
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,936
Yes.

616
01:02:31,937 --> 01:02:34,274
Are you insane? He'll kill you.

617
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:38,069
No, he won't. Not this one.

618
01:02:38,194 --> 01:02:41,281
He is as gentle as a lamb.

619
01:02:41,406 --> 01:02:45,702
Stand back. Stand back.
For the love of God, he has a rotten brain.

620
01:02:46,286 --> 01:02:48,580
It's not rotten. It's a good brain.

621
01:02:48,705 --> 01:02:51,708
It's rotten, I tell you. Rotten.

622
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:55,712
Lxnay on the ottenray.

623
01:02:55,837 --> 01:02:59,549
I'm not afraid. I know what he likes.

624
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,984
That music.

625
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:22,948
Yes. It's in your blood.
It's in the blood of all Frankensteins.

626
01:03:23,074 --> 01:03:27,120
It reaches the soul when words are useless.

627
01:03:27,245 --> 01:03:30,874
Your grandfather used to play it
to the creature he was making.

628
01:03:30,999 --> 01:03:33,585
- Then it was you all the time.
- Yes.

629
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:36,713
- You played that music in the night.
- Yes.

630
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:39,591
- To get us into the laboratory.
- Yes.

631
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:43,303
- That was your cigar in the ashtray.
- Yes.

632
01:03:43,428 --> 01:03:46,807
And it was you who left
my grandfather's book out for me to find.

633
01:03:46,932 --> 01:03:48,183
Yes.

634
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:50,018
- So that I would...
- Yes.

635
01:03:50,143 --> 01:03:52,814
- Then you and Victor were...
- Yes.

636
01:03:52,897 --> 01:03:55,149
Yes! Say it!

637
01:03:55,274 --> 01:03:59,112
He was my boyfriend.

638
01:04:10,998 --> 01:04:13,042
You will never catch him now.

639
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:16,504
He's free. Do you hear?

640
01:04:16,629 --> 01:04:18,966
Free.

641
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:34,064
Gone.

642
01:04:34,606 --> 01:04:35,983
Gone!

643
01:04:36,108 --> 01:04:38,610
We've got to find him, do you understand?

644
01:04:38,736 --> 01:04:41,655
We've got to find him
before he kills someone.

645
01:04:42,406 --> 01:04:44,450
What have I done?

646
01:04:44,908 --> 01:04:47,162
Oh, God in heaven.

647
01:04:48,246 --> 01:04:50,290
What have I done?

648
01:04:56,755 --> 01:05:00,133
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

649
01:05:00,592 --> 01:05:04,095
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

650
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:07,140
Oh, I love my flower

651
01:05:13,481 --> 01:05:15,524
That monster is loose...

652
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:19,445
Boards must be tight.

653
01:05:21,447 --> 01:05:23,491
There.

654
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:27,203
Thank God you put Helga to bed.

655
01:05:27,328 --> 01:05:31,624
With all this monster business,
I take no chances. I remember the last time.

656
01:05:31,707 --> 01:05:36,796
But, Papa. I told you that I was turning
the <i>Rostbraten,</i> don't you remember?

657
01:05:36,921 --> 01:05:38,965
I asked you to put Helga to...

658
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:41,009
You...

659
01:05:45,263 --> 01:05:48,100
Now throw a kiss and say bye-bye.

660
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:58,652
Oh, dear. Nothing left.

661
01:05:58,777 --> 01:06:01,363
What shall we throw in now?

662
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:08,413
Maybe she was in the bathroom
when you looked.

663
01:06:08,538 --> 01:06:11,791
But I didn't even look upstairs.
I thought you did.

664
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:16,129
You didn't look upstairs?

665
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,924
Sit down.

666
01:06:21,092 --> 01:06:22,468
Sit down!

667
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:13,063
A visitor is all I ask.

668
01:07:13,146 --> 01:07:17,776
A temporary companion to help me
pass a few short hours in my lonely life.

669
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:25,076
Thank you, Lord. Thank you.

670
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:37,922
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't speak. Don't say a word.

671
01:07:38,506 --> 01:07:41,675
Oh, my joy and my prize from heaven.

672
01:07:42,551 --> 01:07:45,721
Oh, you must have been
the tallest one in your class.

673
01:07:45,846 --> 01:07:49,476
My name is Harold and I live here all alone.

674
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:51,395
What is your name?

675
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,730
I didn't get that.

676
01:07:54,689 --> 01:07:56,400
No...

677
01:07:57,067 --> 01:07:58,860
Forgive me.

678
01:07:58,944 --> 01:08:01,947
I didn't realise you were a mute.

679
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:04,074
You see how heaven plans.

680
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:07,577
Me, a poor blind man, and you a mute.

681
01:08:09,704 --> 01:08:12,124
An incredibly big mute.

682
01:08:12,249 --> 01:08:14,543
But your hand is frozen, my child.

683
01:08:14,669 --> 01:08:17,338
How does a nice bowl of soup sound, huh?

684
01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:31,519
Well, I know what it means
to be cold and hungry.

685
01:08:31,644 --> 01:08:32,687
Yes...

686
01:08:32,812 --> 01:08:36,482
And how much it means to have
a little kindness from a stranger.

687
01:08:36,607 --> 01:08:39,360
Are you ready for your soup?

688
01:08:41,071 --> 01:08:43,907
Hold out your bowl, then.

689
01:08:45,576 --> 01:08:47,536
Oh, my friend...

690
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:50,205
You don't know what your visit means to me.

691
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:53,959
How long I've waited for the pleasure
of another human being.

692
01:08:54,084 --> 01:08:57,838
Sometimes in our preoccupation
with worldly matters,

693
01:08:59,673 --> 01:09:03,552
we tend to forget the simple pleasures

694
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:06,930
that are the basis for true happiness.

695
01:09:08,433 --> 01:09:11,436
And now a little wine with your soup?

696
01:09:13,271 --> 01:09:15,315
Good, good.

697
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:27,077
Huh? Good. Yes.

698
01:09:31,456 --> 01:09:33,793
Wait!

699
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:36,295
A toast.

700
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:40,091
A toast to long friendship.

701
01:09:46,514 --> 01:09:48,557
How hungry you must have been.

702
01:09:48,682 --> 01:09:51,143
Now for a little surprise.

703
01:09:51,268 --> 01:09:54,021
For a special occasion, I've been saving...

704
01:09:59,276 --> 01:10:01,279
...cigars.

705
01:10:02,906 --> 01:10:04,699
Take one.

706
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,204
What?

707
01:10:09,287 --> 01:10:11,331
No, no, no.

708
01:10:11,998 --> 01:10:13,959
Fire is good.

709
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:17,587
Fire is good. Yes, fire is our friend.

710
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:20,006
Yes. I'll show you.

711
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,685
You see?

712
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,146
You have your cigar?

713
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,273
Let me see. Let me see.

714
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,024
All right.

715
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:39,152
Now, now, now...

716
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,155
Just hold it right there. Now,

717
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:46,075
don't inhale until the tip glows.

718
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:06,513
Wait.

719
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:10,100
Wait.

720
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:12,227
Where are you going?

721
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:16,273
I was gonna make espresso.

722
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:00,903
Now!

723
01:12:05,616 --> 01:12:07,660
Quick. Give him the sedative.

724
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:27,139
He's out.

725
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:29,891
I know.

726
01:12:38,735 --> 01:12:43,114
I'm going in there. Bring me that candle.

727
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:45,283
- No.
- Yes.

728
01:12:49,954 --> 01:12:51,914
Love

729
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:55,460
is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.

730
01:12:56,169 --> 01:12:59,255
And I am going to convince him
that he is loved

731
01:13:00,465 --> 01:13:03,469
even at the cost of my own life.

732
01:13:05,512 --> 01:13:09,892
No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly I beg you,

733
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:13,437
no matter how terribly I may scream,

734
01:13:14,396 --> 01:13:18,776
do not open this door,
or you will undo everything I've worked for.

735
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:20,444
Do you understand?

736
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:23,739
Do not open this door.

737
01:13:23,822 --> 01:13:25,282
Yes, Doctor.

738
01:13:27,576 --> 01:13:29,621
Nice working with you.

739
01:14:01,821 --> 01:14:04,990
Let me out. Let me out of here.
Get me the hell out of here.

740
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:08,494
What's the matter with you people?
I was joking.

741
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:10,830
Don't you know ajoke when you hear one?

742
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,837
Jesus Christ. Get me outta here!

743
01:14:20,297 --> 01:14:23,969
Open this goddamn door
or I'll kick your rotten heads in.

744
01:14:24,094 --> 01:14:25,637
Mommy!

745
01:14:33,979 --> 01:14:35,856
Obviously...

746
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:42,320
Hello, handsome.

747
01:14:45,323 --> 01:14:47,702
You're a good-looking fellow, you know?

748
01:14:47,827 --> 01:14:50,329
People laugh at you.

749
01:14:50,455 --> 01:14:53,207
People hate you, but why do they hate you?

750
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:57,170
Because they are jealous.

751
01:14:58,421 --> 01:15:01,090
Look at that boyish face.

752
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:05,094
Look at that sweet smile.

753
01:15:06,846 --> 01:15:09,932
Do you wanna talk about physical strength?

754
01:15:10,016 --> 01:15:13,352
Do you want to talk about sheer muscle?

755
01:15:14,813 --> 01:15:17,983
Do you want to talk
about the Olympian ideal?

756
01:15:18,108 --> 01:15:20,778
You are a god!

757
01:15:21,737 --> 01:15:23,781
And listen to me...

758
01:15:24,698 --> 01:15:27,242
You are not evil.

759
01:15:28,702 --> 01:15:32,998
You are good!

760
01:15:41,132 --> 01:15:44,135
This is a nice boy.

761
01:15:44,886 --> 01:15:46,930
This is a good boy.

762
01:15:47,889 --> 01:15:50,266
This is a mother's angel.

763
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:53,770
And I want the world to know,

764
01:15:54,646 --> 01:15:58,233
once and for all and without any shame,

765
01:15:59,943 --> 01:16:02,695
that we love him.

766
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:09,245
I'm going to teach you.

767
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:14,250
I'm gonna show you how to walk,
how to speak, how to move, how to think.

768
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:16,961
Together,

769
01:16:17,044 --> 01:16:19,088
you and I

770
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:25,177
are going to make
the greatest single contribution to science

771
01:16:26,053 --> 01:16:28,806
since the creation of fire!

772
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:32,853
Dr Fronkonsteen. Are you all right?

773
01:16:32,978 --> 01:16:35,021
My name...

774
01:16:35,856 --> 01:16:39,109
...is Frankenstein!

775
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:36,251
Distinguished colleagues,
ladies and gentlemen.

776
01:17:36,335 --> 01:17:38,462
Tonight it is my great privilege

777
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:42,883
of introducing to you a man
whose family name was once both

778
01:17:43,008 --> 01:17:45,010
famous

779
01:17:45,135 --> 01:17:47,387
and infamous.

780
01:17:47,971 --> 01:17:54,437
And now may I present to you
<i>Doktor Baron</i> Friedrich von Frankenstein.

781
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:05,323
My fellow scienti...

782
01:18:06,574 --> 01:18:11,496
...tists... and neurosurgeons,
ladies and gentlemen.

783
01:18:12,372 --> 01:18:15,125
A few short weeks ago,
coming from a background,

784
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:20,423
believe me, as conservative and traditionally
grounded in scientific fact as any of you,

785
01:18:20,548 --> 01:18:25,511
I began an experiment in,
incredulous as it may sound,

786
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:29,223
the reanimation of dead tissue.

787
01:18:32,435 --> 01:18:36,897
What I have to offer you might possibly be

788
01:18:37,022 --> 01:18:39,859
the gateway to immortality.

789
01:18:45,115 --> 01:18:51,037
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present for
your intellectual and philosophical pleasure

790
01:18:52,873 --> 01:18:54,916
the Creature.

791
01:19:01,339 --> 01:19:03,467
Remain in your seats, I beg you.

792
01:19:03,592 --> 01:19:06,928
We are not children here. We are scientists.

793
01:19:07,888 --> 01:19:10,266
I assure you there is nothing to fear.

794
01:19:13,895 --> 01:19:17,648
First may I offer for your consideration

795
01:19:17,774 --> 01:19:22,403
a neurological demonstration
of the primary cerebellar functions.

796
01:19:23,362 --> 01:19:26,449
Balance and coordination.

797
01:19:28,826 --> 01:19:31,829
Walk heel to toe.

798
01:19:45,427 --> 01:19:47,471
Backwards.

799
01:20:03,738 --> 01:20:08,284
Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen
the Creature perform simple motor activity,

800
01:20:08,368 --> 01:20:13,248
but for what you will see next
we must enter quietly

801
01:20:13,373 --> 01:20:16,543
into the realm of genius.

802
01:20:19,337 --> 01:20:21,381
Ladies and gentlemen,

803
01:20:25,218 --> 01:20:29,765
from what was once
an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues,

804
01:20:29,849 --> 01:20:33,894
may I now present
a cultured, sophisticated

805
01:20:35,312 --> 01:20:37,106
man about town.

806
01:20:41,235 --> 01:20:42,486
Hit it.

807
01:22:27,178 --> 01:22:29,222
Nothing. Nothing, I tell you.

808
01:22:30,098 --> 01:22:31,808
Five, six, seven, eight...

809
01:22:35,145 --> 01:22:38,314
Come on. Are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

810
01:22:43,362 --> 01:22:44,739
Please. I beg you.

811
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:47,616
For safety's sake, don't humiliate him.

812
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:54,915
Come back. Do you hear me?
I will not let you destroy my work.

813
01:22:54,999 --> 01:22:57,668
As your creator
I command you to come back.

814
01:23:51,307 --> 01:23:53,101
Chained.

815
01:23:53,184 --> 01:23:55,853
Chained like a beast in a cage.

816
01:23:56,813 --> 01:23:59,274
Oh, Doctor. I feel so terrible.

817
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:01,443
There's only one answer.

818
01:24:01,568 --> 01:24:06,281
If I could find a way to equalise
the imbalance in his cerebral-spinal fluid,

819
01:24:06,406 --> 01:24:09,243
why, he'd be as right as rain.

820
01:24:09,993 --> 01:24:11,620
But how?

821
01:24:11,745 --> 01:24:13,997
How, before it's too late?

822
01:24:15,249 --> 01:24:16,959
Oh, Frederick...

823
01:24:17,084 --> 01:24:19,211
If only there was some way I could...

824
01:24:20,337 --> 01:24:23,006
...relieve this torture you are going through.

825
01:24:25,218 --> 01:24:27,262
If there was some way I could help to...

826
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:34,686
...relieve the tension. If there was just
some way I could give you a little peace.

827
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,654
Doctor, I have...

828
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:46,656
Doctor?

829
01:24:47,699 --> 01:24:49,743
What is it?

830
01:24:52,246 --> 01:24:54,123
Doctor...

831
01:24:54,206 --> 01:24:56,417
Where are you?

832
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:13,225
I'm sorry, Doctor.
This cable came while you were gone.

833
01:25:13,309 --> 01:25:18,190
I thought I told you never to
interrupt me while I'm working.

834
01:25:19,524 --> 01:25:23,195
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I thought this was an emergency.

835
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:27,240
You see, your fiancée
will be arriving any second.

836
01:25:27,365 --> 01:25:29,951
What? Elizabeth here tonight?

837
01:25:30,077 --> 01:25:33,413
Yes. I will go prepare a room at once.

838
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,375
I suggest you put on a tie.

839
01:25:57,438 --> 01:25:59,565
Darling.

840
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:01,776
Darling.

841
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:03,444
- Surprised?
- Surprised.

842
01:26:03,528 --> 01:26:05,571
- Love me?
- Love you?

843
01:26:06,572 --> 01:26:08,616
Well...

844
01:26:09,409 --> 01:26:12,079
- Let's turn in.
- Darling.

845
01:26:12,162 --> 01:26:16,792
It's been a long day. I'm sure you're very tired.
I'll just pay the driver.

846
01:26:17,668 --> 01:26:20,337
- Darling.
- What?

847
01:26:20,921 --> 01:26:23,424
- Surprised?
- Yes.

848
01:26:23,549 --> 01:26:25,592
- Love me?
- Well...

849
01:26:25,717 --> 01:26:27,970
Well, let's turn in.

850
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:29,638
- Darling.
- Yes.

851
01:26:29,763 --> 01:26:31,473
Say nothing, act casual.

852
01:26:31,557 --> 01:26:34,226
- Ready?
- Yes. I think...

853
01:26:34,935 --> 01:26:36,646
Yes.

854
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:38,815
I am a bit tired after all.

855
01:26:41,025 --> 01:26:44,195
I'd like you to meet
my assistants, Inga and I-gor.

856
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,364
How do you do?

857
01:26:47,282 --> 01:26:48,283
How do you do?

858
01:26:48,408 --> 01:26:52,704
- This is my financier Elizabeth.
- I'm so happy to meet you at last.

859
01:26:52,787 --> 01:26:53,788
Financée.

860
01:26:53,913 --> 01:26:59,252
Excuse me, darling.
What is it exactly that you... do do?

861
01:27:02,006 --> 01:27:06,051
Well, I assist Dr Fronkonsteen
in the laboratory.

862
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:08,888
We have intellectual discussions <i>und</i> we...

863
01:27:09,013 --> 01:27:11,348
As a matter of fact, we were just having one...

864
01:27:11,474 --> 01:27:12,850
- May I?
- What?

865
01:27:12,975 --> 01:27:14,602
Wait a minute...

866
01:27:14,727 --> 01:27:17,480
l-gor, would you give me
a hand with the bags?

867
01:27:17,563 --> 01:27:22,026
Certainly, you take the blonde
and I'll take the one in the turban.

868
01:27:26,864 --> 01:27:29,534
Stop that. I'm talking about the luggage.

869
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:31,286
Yes, master.

870
01:27:31,953 --> 01:27:33,997
Ladies, this way.

871
01:27:35,749 --> 01:27:39,461
It'll be a long night.
If you need any help with the girls...

872
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:49,179
You settle down now.

873
01:27:49,304 --> 01:27:52,474
Cos we gonna be pals.

874
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,019
Right?

875
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,649
Nice and cosy.

876
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:02,860
Just like old friends.

877
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:15,998
What's the matter?
You're afraid of this little fire?

878
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:17,959
This can't hurt you.

879
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,087
See?

880
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,257
Some monster you are.

881
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,467
See, Mama was right.

882
01:28:25,592 --> 01:28:29,054
Little boys ain't supposed to play with fire.

883
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,975
Is they? Cos they might get hurt.

884
01:29:01,129 --> 01:29:02,672
Halt!

885
01:29:02,797 --> 01:29:04,507
Up.

886
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:07,260
A riot is an ugly thing.

887
01:29:08,303 --> 01:29:12,516
<i>Und</i> I think that it is just about time
that we had one.

888
01:29:14,935 --> 01:29:16,479
Kill the monster.

889
01:29:16,854 --> 01:29:20,024
As heaven is my witness... Up.

890
01:29:20,107 --> 01:29:23,736
...he will curse the day

891
01:29:23,861 --> 01:29:27,656
that he was burn a Frankenstein.

892
01:29:28,657 --> 01:29:29,658
What?

893
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:35,372
I said: "He will curse the day
that he was born a Frankenstein."

894
01:29:51,807 --> 01:29:55,435
Loose. He's broken loose.

895
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,854
Do you know what that means?

896
01:29:57,979 --> 01:30:00,649
Darling, you mustn't worry so.

897
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:05,071
I suppose you're right.

898
01:30:05,196 --> 01:30:07,073
Of course I am.

899
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:09,242
Now come along like a good boy.

900
01:30:09,784 --> 01:30:11,744
What would I do without you?

901
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:16,457
Is your room just down the hall
in case I get the frights during the night?

902
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:21,921
Well, yes, but I thought perhaps tonight,
under the circumstances, I might

903
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:24,632
stay here with you.

904
01:30:24,757 --> 01:30:27,343
Would you want me like this now?

905
01:30:27,468 --> 01:30:31,181
So soon before our wedding,
so near we can almost touch it?

906
01:30:33,976 --> 01:30:36,228
- Yes!
- Whoa, boy.

907
01:30:37,229 --> 01:30:39,273
Or

908
01:30:39,398 --> 01:30:45,154
to wait just a little while longer when
I can give myself to you without hesitation,

909
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:49,158
when I can be totally
and unashamedly and legally yours?

910
01:30:53,328 --> 01:30:55,914
That's a tough choice.

911
01:30:56,039 --> 01:30:58,293
You're a tough guy.

912
01:31:01,004 --> 01:31:02,881
I suppose you're right.

913
01:31:02,964 --> 01:31:05,008
Of course I am. I always am.

914
01:31:06,176 --> 01:31:08,720
Now give me a kiss and say good night.

915
01:31:12,015 --> 01:31:14,058
No tongues.

916
01:31:21,149 --> 01:31:23,652
Good night, darling.

917
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:26,155
Good night, sweetheart.

918
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,491
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

919
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:32,536
You love me? I love you, honey.

920
01:31:32,661 --> 01:31:35,039
- Sweet dreams, darling.
- Sweet dreams.

921
01:31:35,164 --> 01:31:38,501
Good night, don't let the bedbugs bite.

922
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:50,722
He has loosed the fateful lightning
of his terrible swift sword

923
01:31:51,181 --> 01:31:54,351
His truth is marching on

924
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:00,816
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

925
01:32:55,914 --> 01:32:57,958
Where am I?

926
01:33:00,294 --> 01:33:02,880
Who are you? What are you?

927
01:33:03,005 --> 01:33:05,758
What do you want?
What are you going to do to me?

928
01:33:06,759 --> 01:33:08,720
Calm down.

929
01:33:08,803 --> 01:33:10,680
I'm not afraid of you.

930
01:33:10,764 --> 01:33:14,809
My father is very rich.
You'd have the world at your fingertips.

931
01:33:14,934 --> 01:33:21,274
Listen. I have to be back by 11.30.
I'm expecting a very important call.

932
01:33:22,233 --> 01:33:24,486
Speak! Why don't you speak?

933
01:33:24,611 --> 01:33:26,654
What are you doing?

934
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:29,032
Oh, no, you can't be serious.

935
01:33:31,367 --> 01:33:33,411
I'm af...

936
01:33:34,205 --> 01:33:36,165
Oh, my God.

937
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:37,291
Woof.

938
01:33:40,753 --> 01:33:42,379
I'm engaged.

939
01:33:42,505 --> 01:33:45,174
And once he... But I didn't... It was never...

940
01:33:51,847 --> 01:33:54,100
Sweet mystery of life

941
01:33:54,225 --> 01:33:57,228
At last I found you

942
01:33:57,812 --> 01:34:03,401
At last I know the secret of it all

943
01:34:35,226 --> 01:34:37,770
Penny for your thoughts.

944
01:34:39,897 --> 01:34:42,817
You're incorrigible, aren't you?

945
01:34:43,192 --> 01:34:45,736
You little zipper-neck.

946
01:34:49,031 --> 01:34:50,491
All right.

947
01:34:50,575 --> 01:34:53,245
Seven has always been my lucky number.

948
01:34:54,663 --> 01:34:57,416
Come over here, you hot monster.

949
01:35:00,878 --> 01:35:03,714
What is it? What's the matter?

950
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:07,009
Is it that music?

951
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:10,929
It's probably from some nearby cottage.
Nothing to worry about.

952
01:35:11,054 --> 01:35:13,098
Where are you going? Where...

953
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:15,434
You men are all alike.

954
01:35:15,559 --> 01:35:18,562
Seven or eight quick ones
and you're off with the boys.

955
01:35:18,645 --> 01:35:22,275
To boast and brag.
You better keep your mouth shut.

956
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:25,570
Oh, I think I love him.

957
01:36:12,369 --> 01:36:15,831
Look, he's coming back.
Look, the music...

958
01:36:16,498 --> 01:36:18,500
Keep playing. It's the music.

959
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:21,628
It's the music that's bringing him back.

960
01:36:24,422 --> 01:36:26,133
Come on.

961
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:35,934
Come on. Come.

962
01:36:41,065 --> 01:36:43,276
Come on. You can do it.

963
01:36:49,115 --> 01:36:51,784
Come on. You can do it.

964
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:01,961
Don't touch him!
He wants to do it by himself.

965
01:37:02,628 --> 01:37:05,632
You can do it. You can do it.

966
01:37:06,425 --> 01:37:08,927
Please, my creation.

967
01:37:19,271 --> 01:37:21,315
Quick. Catch him.

968
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,823
Have all the preparations
been made for the transference?

969
01:37:29,948 --> 01:37:31,409
Yes, Doctor.

970
01:37:31,534 --> 01:37:34,037
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

971
01:37:34,162 --> 01:37:36,623
It's the only thing that can save him now.

972
01:37:37,248 --> 01:37:40,335
You realise you're risking both your lives?

973
01:37:42,796 --> 01:37:44,839
Yes.

974
01:37:57,561 --> 01:37:59,605
Switching off.

975
01:38:19,542 --> 01:38:21,794
How will I know when they are done?

976
01:38:21,919 --> 01:38:24,214
The doctor said to allow 15 minutes.

977
01:38:24,923 --> 01:38:27,134
Not one second more

978
01:38:27,217 --> 01:38:29,010
or less.

979
01:38:37,644 --> 01:38:39,354
How long now?

980
01:38:39,438 --> 01:38:41,064
Two minutes.

981
01:39:03,504 --> 01:39:05,548
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.

982
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:07,967
- What time is it?
- Almost time.

983
01:39:12,597 --> 01:39:15,517
Oh, my God. It's the villagers.

984
01:39:17,728 --> 01:39:19,980
No! No! Please.

985
01:39:20,105 --> 01:39:22,357
Just another seven seconds.

986
01:39:25,652 --> 01:39:27,696
No! No!

987
01:39:29,323 --> 01:39:31,366
No! No! No!

988
01:39:32,075 --> 01:39:34,828
- Put that man down.
- It's the monster.

989
01:39:34,953 --> 01:39:36,747
- No, it can't be.
- It is.

990
01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:39,500
I said: "Put that man down."

991
01:39:48,843 --> 01:39:51,513
<i>Undjust</i> who do you think you are

992
01:39:51,596 --> 01:39:54,516
that you order these people about?

993
01:39:54,641 --> 01:39:56,684
I am the monster.

994
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:01,523
<i>Ja.</i> I see that you are the monster.

995
01:40:01,648 --> 01:40:04,317
For as long as I can remember

996
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,903
people have hated me.

997
01:40:07,195 --> 01:40:10,366
They looked at my face and my body

998
01:40:10,491 --> 01:40:12,535
and they ran away in horror.

999
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:19,375
In my loneliness, I decided that if I could not
inspire love, which was my deepest hope,

1000
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,669
I would instead cause fear.

1001
01:40:23,838 --> 01:40:25,881
I live,

1002
01:40:27,174 --> 01:40:32,429
because this poor, half-crazed
genius has given me life.

1003
01:40:33,013 --> 01:40:35,058
He alone held an image of me

1004
01:40:35,183 --> 01:40:37,561
as something beautiful.

1005
01:40:37,978 --> 01:40:39,855
And then,

1006
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:43,817
when it would have been easy enough
to stay out of danger,

1007
01:40:44,317 --> 01:40:47,404
he used his own body as a guinea pig

1008
01:40:47,487 --> 01:40:50,157
to give me a calmer brain

1009
01:40:51,241 --> 01:40:57,497
and a somewhat more
sophisticated way of expressing myself.

1010
01:40:57,622 --> 01:41:02,420
Well, this is, of course,
an entirely different situation.

1011
01:41:03,129 --> 01:41:05,798
As the leader of this community,

1012
01:41:05,923 --> 01:41:09,635
may I be the first to offer you my hand

1013
01:41:10,386 --> 01:41:12,430
in friendship.

1014
01:41:18,478 --> 01:41:20,855
- Thank you.
- You are entirely welcome.

1015
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:25,903
<i>Und</i> now let us all go to my house
for a little sponge cake <i>und</i> a little wine...

1016
01:41:27,237 --> 01:41:29,281
<i>... und</i> shit!

1017
01:41:31,825 --> 01:41:33,869
To the lumberyard!

1018
01:41:57,685 --> 01:42:00,271
Hello, Mrs Frankenstein.

1019
01:42:01,022 --> 01:42:04,275
Mrs Frankenstein. What a beautiful name.

1020
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,111
Oh, darling.

1021
01:42:06,194 --> 01:42:08,238
Hold on to your hat.

1022
01:42:09,697 --> 01:42:10,615
What?

1023
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:13,743
I'll be right back.

1024
01:42:28,008 --> 01:42:30,594
I'm holding on to it, darling.

1025
01:42:31,637 --> 01:42:34,098
Just a few more seconds.

1026
01:43:14,265 --> 01:43:18,394
Honey, I hope you didn't find
Daddy's little party too boring.

1027
01:43:18,519 --> 01:43:21,939
He did it just for you
and he meant so well. Say you liked it.

1028
01:43:23,274 --> 01:43:25,318
Honey, did you see?

1029
01:43:25,443 --> 01:43:28,946
I put a special hamper in the bathroom
just for your shirts

1030
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:32,116
and the other one is just for socks
and poo-poo undies.

1031
01:43:32,241 --> 01:43:33,951
Here I come.

1032
01:44:03,066 --> 01:44:05,568
The feeling is mutual.

1033
01:44:07,862 --> 01:44:09,906
You know, it's a puzzlement.

1034
01:44:10,031 --> 01:44:14,494
There's something I've always wanted
to ask you about that operation.

1035
01:44:14,619 --> 01:44:16,830
You know in the transference part,

1036
01:44:16,913 --> 01:44:22,418
the monster got part of your wonderful brain,
but what did you ever get from him?

1037
01:44:32,138 --> 01:44:35,141
No. I don't believe...

1038
01:44:39,353 --> 01:44:41,564
Sweet mystery of life

1039
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:44,441
At last I found you

1040
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:34,202
