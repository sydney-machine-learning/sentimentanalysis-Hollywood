1
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:39,451
All right, Curly, enough's enough.

2
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:44,186
You can't eat the Venetian blinds.
I just had them installed on Wednesday.

3
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:02,036
Down the hatch.

4
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,192
- She's no good.
- What can I tell you, kid? You're right.

5
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:18,921
When you're right, you're right.

6
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:20,723
And you're right.

7
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,833
I'll pay you the rest next week.

8
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:26,767
We only caught 60 tonne of skipjack
down in San Benedict.

9
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:30,067
And they don't pay you the same
for skipjack as they do albacore or tuna.

10
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,401
Forget it, will you, Curly?

11
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:34,841
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.

12
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:37,175
What kind of a guy do you think I am?

13
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,681
- Thank you, Mr. Gittes.
- Call me Jake.

14
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:42,217
Careful driving home, Curl, huh?

15
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:46,945
Mrs. Mulwray's waiting for you
with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

16
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,756
Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. Gittes?

17
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:54,726
- Mrs. Mulwray, how do you do?
- Mr. Gittes.

18
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:58,268
Now, what seems to be the problem?

19
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:00,569
My husband,

20
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:03,306
I believe, is seeing another woman.

21
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:08,273
- No. Really?
- I'm afraid so.

22
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:10,040
I am sorry.

23
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:14,106
Mr. Gittes, please, do you think
we could discuss this alone?

24
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,321
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray.
These are my operatives,

25
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:22,721
and at some point,
they're going to have to assist me.

26
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:25,226
I can't do everything myself.

27
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:26,660
Of course not.

28
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:28,094
Now,

29
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:34,937
what makes you certain
that your husband is

30
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,637
involved with someone?

31
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,435
A wife can tell.

32
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:44,109
Mrs. Mulwray,
do you love your husband?

33
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:46,441
Yes, of course!

34
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,950
- Then go home and forget everything.
- But, l...

35
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:51,179
I'm sure that he loves you, too,
Mrs. Mulwray.

36
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:55,189
Do you know the expression,
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?

37
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,760
You're better off not knowing.

38
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,489
I have to know.

39
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,768
Very well.

40
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:10,632
What is your husband's first name?

41
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:11,867
Hollis.

42
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,601
Hollis Mulwray.

43
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,771
- Water and Power?
- He's Chief Engineer.

44
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,013
Chief Engineer?

45
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,216
Mrs. Mulwray, this...

46
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,763
This type of investigation can be hard
on your pocketbook.

47
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,026
It takes time...

48
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,931
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.

49
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:45,338
Okay, we'll...

50
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,369
We'll see what we can do.

51
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:51,039
Gentlemen, today
you can walk out that door,

52
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:54,207
turn right, hop a streetcar,
and within 25 minutes,

53
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:56,842
end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

54
00:05:56,987 --> 00:06:00,650
Now, you can swim in it and you can
fish in it, but you can't drink it,

55
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:04,022
and you can't irrigate
an orange grove with it.

56
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:06,686
Now remember,
we live next door to the ocean,

57
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:09,864
but we also live on the edge of a desert.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,628
Los Angeles is a desert community.

59
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:16,297
Beneath this building,
beneath our streets, is a desert.

60
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:19,406
And without water,
the dust will rise up and cover us

61
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:20,908
as though we never existed.

62
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:24,207
Now, the Alto Vallejo
can save us from this,

63
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:28,182
and I respectfully suggest
that $8.5 million

64
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:32,244
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets

65
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:33,378
and not on top of them.

66
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:34,647
Hear, hear!

67
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:43,226
Mayor Bagby, let's hear
from all the departments again.

68
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:46,564
I suppose we'd better take
Water and Power first.

69
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:47,897
Mr. Mulwray?

70
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,383
In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,

71
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:05,114
over 500 lives were lost
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.

72
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:10,225
Core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock

73
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:14,923
is shale similar to the permeable shale
in the Van der Lip disaster.

74
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:18,034
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

75
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:21,730
And now you propose
yet another dirt-banked terminus dam

76
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:25,035
with slopes of 2.5:1, 112 feet high,

77
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:27,610
and a 12,000-acre water surface.

78
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,102
Well, it won't hold.

79
00:07:30,747 --> 00:07:33,307
I won't build it. It's that simple.

80
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,214
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

81
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,150
Thank you, gentlemen.

82
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:46,292
Quiet! Quiet!

83
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:52,733
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get those goddamn things out of here!

84
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:55,168
- Hold some of them.
- Tell me where to take them!

85
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:58,832
You don't have an answer for that
so quick, do you?

86
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,570
You steal water from the Valley,
ruin the grazing,

87
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:05,447
starve the livestock!

88
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:07,915
Who's paying you to do that,
Mr. Mulwray?

89
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:09,679
That's what I want to know!

90
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,399
- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.

91
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,868
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

92
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:11,550
Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,

93
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:15,215
a men's room at a Richfield gas station,
and The Pig'n Whistle.

94
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:17,883
The guy's got water on the brain.

95
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:31,866
So what do you got?

96
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:55,055
This?

97
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:59,363
Well, they got into a terrific argument
outside The Pig'n Whistle.

98
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:02,428
What about?

99
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,972
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud.

100
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:06,939
I heard only one thing, though.

101
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:08,304
"Apple core."

102
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:11,410
- "Apple core"?
- Yeah.

103
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:17,643
My God, Walsh, is that
what you spent your day doing?

104
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:21,154
Look, you tell me to take pictures,
I take pictures.

105
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,885
Let me explain
something to you, Walsh.

106
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,392
J. J. Gittes and Associates.

107
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:28,896
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

108
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,127
What is it, Sophie?

109
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:35,134
Duffy's on the phone.

110
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,503
- Yeah, Duff, where are you?
- I got it!

111
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:44,306
He's found himself
some cute little twist, the old buzzard...

112
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:45,937
Okay. Slow down. Where are you?

113
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,744
I'm at Glendale and Douglas.

114
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:50,684
They're in Echo Park in a rowboat.
A rowboat!

115
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,117
Okay.

116
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:56,450
Echo Park.

117
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,651
Water again.

118
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,271
Okay, pal, let's have us a big smile.

119
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,443
You'll love it.

120
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:15,771
Here. Let me...

121
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:31,245
When you get so much publicity,
you got to get blase about it.

122
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:34,879
Let's face it, Jake,
you're practically a movie star.

123
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:42,789
- Just look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.

124
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,263
Sure is.

125
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,732
Fools' names and fools' faces.

126
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:52,868
- What's that, pal?
- Nothing.

127
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,571
You got a hell of a way to make a living.

128
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:58,943
Oh? And what do you do
to make ends meet?

129
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:01,949
Mortgage department,
First National Bank.

130
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:06,213
T ell me, did you foreclose
on many families this week?

131
00:17:06,322 --> 00:17:08,722
We don't publish a record in the paper,
I can tell you that.

132
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:10,292
Neither do l.

133
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:12,894
No, you have your press agent do it.

134
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:16,261
Who is this bimbo, Barney?
Is he a regular customer or what?

135
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:18,061
Hey, listen, pal, I make an honest living.

136
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,135
People only come to me
when they're in a desperate situation.

137
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:22,464
I help them out.
I don't kick families out of their houses

138
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:25,506
- like you bums down at the bank do!
- Jake, can I tell you about the guy who...

139
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:27,439
Maybe you'd like to step down
out of the barber chair

140
00:17:27,543 --> 00:17:29,010
and maybe we can go outside
and discuss it.

141
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:30,134
- What do you think?
- Oh, come on.

142
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,610
Jake, let me tell you about the guy
who got tired...

143
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:33,739
I don't know how that thing
got in the newspaper.

144
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,977
It was so quick,
I didn't even know it myself.

145
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,178
- Thank you.
- I make an honest living!

146
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,754
Of course you do.

147
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:42,154
Anyway, this guy
who got tired of screwing his wife

148
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,657
- said to his friend, "What do I do?"
- An honest living, you understand?

149
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,659
So the guy says, "Why don't you do
what the Chinese do?"

150
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:48,354
He says, "What do the Chinese do?"

151
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,591
He says, "The Chinese they screw
a little and they get tired..."

152
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,101
Duffy. Hey, Walsh!

153
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:57,832
Sophie, go to the little girls' room
for a minute, okay?

154
00:17:58,174 --> 00:18:00,642
- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...

155
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:03,311
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

156
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:04,471
- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.

157
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,842
I want to tell you a story.

158
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:08,041
So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?

159
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:09,947
He's tired of screwing his wife.

160
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:11,611
- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.

161
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,279
You're always in such a hurry.

162
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:15,016
So his friend says to him,

163
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:17,285
"Hey, why don't you
do it like the Chinese do?"

164
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:19,327
So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"

165
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:22,057
The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,
first they screw a little bit,

166
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:24,826
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

167
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,801
"Come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,

168
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:29,735
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.

169
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,170
Walsh, just listen to me for a second.

170
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:33,708
I mean, you'll love this.

171
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:36,971
Now, then they go back
and they screw a little bit more,

172
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,014
and then they go out
and they contemplate the moon

173
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:42,050
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

174
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:46,053
So, now, the guy goes home and
he starts screwing his own wife, see.

175
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:48,422
So, he screws her for a little bit,
and then he stops.

176
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,254
He goes out of the room
and reads LIFE magazine.

177
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:53,419
Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,

178
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,030
and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey"

179
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:56,826
and he goes out
and he smokes a cigarette.

180
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:59,265
Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.

181
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,336
He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,

182
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,405
he gets up to start to leave again
to go look at the moon,

183
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,336
she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?

184
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:08,239
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

185
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:11,173
Jesus!

186
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:13,014
That Barney!

187
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:19,718
Mr. Gittes?

188
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:22,717
Yes.

189
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:25,085
Do you know me?

190
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:27,353
Well,

191
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:31,230
I think I would have remembered.

192
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,268
Have we ever met?

193
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:37,205
Well, no.

194
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,603
Never?

195
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:39,935
Never.

196
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:41,766
That's what I thought.

197
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:43,936
You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

198
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,378
You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?

199
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,081
Not that Mulwray?

200
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:53,781
Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.

201
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:58,156
And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,

202
00:19:58,294 --> 00:20:01,559
you must also agree with me
that I never hired you to do anything,

203
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:04,098
certainly not spy on my husband.

204
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,930
I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.

205
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:10,401
Well, you're going to get it.

206
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:12,606
Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.

207
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,767
I think there's been some
misunderstanding here.

208
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:16,469
There's no point
in getting tough with me. I'm just...

209
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:19,604
I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes.

210
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:21,342
My lawyer does.

211
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:25,615
Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.

212
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:32,153
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

213
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:49,941
- Mr. Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...

214
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:52,708
- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?

215
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:55,147
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

216
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:56,718
Since lunch.

217
00:20:57,186 --> 00:21:00,383
- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?

218
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:04,015
Fifteen minutes ago.
Why don't I just go in and wait?

219
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:06,490
Sir?

220
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,258
Is Mr. Yelburton there?

221
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:15,399
Is he still in the building?

222
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:18,003
Very well. Thank you.

223
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:43,753
Can I help you? Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

224
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,349
J. J. Gittes.

225
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:48,088
It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.

226
00:22:48,197 --> 00:22:50,427
I wonder if you'd care
to wait in my office.

227
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:51,625
Certainly.

228
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:54,799
We're a bit nervous around here

229
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:57,805
with all this business in the papers
about Mr. Mulwray.

230
00:22:57,907 --> 00:22:59,602
Right this way.

231
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:09,842
You know, after you've worked
with a man for a certain length of time,

232
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:12,511
you come to know his habits, his values.

233
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:13,679
You come to know him.

234
00:23:13,823 --> 00:23:16,986
And either he's the kind
who chases after women or he isn't.

235
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:18,458
And Mulwray isn't?

236
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:20,825
He never even kids about it.

237
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,994
Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.

238
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:29,129
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.

239
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:31,399
Do you know
where Mulwray's having lunch?

240
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,531
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

241
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:36,507
Well, tell him I'll be back.

242
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,842
I will.

243
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:41,182
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?

244
00:23:41,283 --> 00:23:43,148
In case I have
to get in touch with you again.

245
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:45,584
- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.

246
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:52,424
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?

247
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:54,859
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?

248
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:58,229
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.

249
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:00,858
You don't take a bath in it.

250
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,665
They wrote you a letter!

251
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:05,706
But then you'd have to be able to read.

252
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:11,107
Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you.
You know Claude Mulvihill here?

253
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:13,841
Well, I hope so. He's working for us.

254
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:15,041
Doing what?

255
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:16,618
Well, frankly, there have been
some threats

256
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:18,515
to blow up the city reservoirs.

257
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:21,181
- Any particular reason?
- Well, it's this darn drought.

258
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,918
We've had to ration water in the Valley
and the farmers are desperate.

259
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,528
But what can we do? The rest of the city
needs drinking water.

260
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:29,257
- Well, you're in luck, Mr. Yelburton.
- How's that?

261
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:31,923
When Mulvihill here
was Sheriff of Ventura County,

262
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:35,401
the rum runners landed hundreds
of tonnes of booze on the beach

263
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:37,972
and never lost a drop.

264
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:41,406
He ought to be able
to hold on to your water for you.

265
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,995
J. J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

266
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:09,194
Please.

267
00:26:25,114 --> 00:26:26,411
You wait.

268
00:27:27,977 --> 00:27:31,140
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah. Sure.

269
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:34,442
Bad for the glass.

270
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,144
Mr. Gittes.

271
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:15,746
Actually, I came to see
your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

272
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:20,157
Would you like something to drink?

273
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:21,456
What are you having?

274
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:24,327
- lced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.

275
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:27,629
- Two iced teas, Kahn, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

276
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:30,931
My husband's at the office.

277
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:34,836
Actually, he's not, Mrs. Mulwray,

278
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:37,468
and he's checked out of his apartment
at the El Macondo.

279
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:40,377
That's not his apartment.

280
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:43,282
Anyway, l...

281
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,051
The point is, is I'm not in business
to be loved, but I am in business,

282
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,556
and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray,
whoever set your husband up,

283
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:51,785
set me up.

284
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:54,124
L. A.'s a small town. People talk.

285
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:57,687
I'm just trying to make a living.
I don't want to become a local joke.

286
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:01,291
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.

287
00:29:01,403 --> 00:29:03,530
- What?
- I said, I'll drop the lawsuit.

288
00:29:03,672 --> 00:29:05,731
So let's just drop the whole thing.

289
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,569
- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both.

290
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,507
- Mrs. Mulwray...
- Yes, Mr. Gittes?

291
00:29:09,611 --> 00:29:11,738
...I don't want to drop it.

292
00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:16,082
I better talk to your husband about this.

293
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:18,686
Why? What on Earth for?

294
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:20,880
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

295
00:29:22,224 --> 00:29:24,715
Well, I've been accused
of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray,

296
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,918
but never that.

297
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:27,995
Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,

298
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:30,395
and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.

299
00:29:30,532 --> 00:29:33,763
I'm not supposed to be the one
who's caught with his pants down.

300
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:36,336
So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.

301
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:38,372
Why should it be a problem?

302
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:42,706
- May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

303
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,073
Well, that little girlfriend,
she was pretty,

304
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:48,445
in a cheap sort of a way, of course.

305
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:51,883
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

306
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:54,922
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?

307
00:29:55,457 --> 00:29:58,153
- It's nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray.
- It's very personal!

308
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:00,591
It couldn't be more personal.

309
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:04,295
Is this business
or an obsession with you?

310
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:06,333
Let's look at it this way.

311
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:10,063
Now, this phony broad,
excuse the language,

312
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:12,640
she tells me she's you. She hires me.

313
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:14,936
Now, whoever put her up to it
doesn't have anything against me.

314
00:30:15,043 --> 00:30:16,169
They're out to get your husband.

315
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:18,779
If I can see him, I can help him.

316
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,441
Did you talk to him this morning?

317
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:26,178
No.

318
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:28,652
I went riding rather early.

319
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,289
Looks like you went quite a distance.

320
00:30:31,393 --> 00:30:33,327
I was riding bareback.

321
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:36,123
You...

322
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,490
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

323
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:41,432
Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks around them.

324
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:43,027
Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30.

325
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:44,833
I'll stop by.

326
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,702
Please call first.

327
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:05,318
Sorry, closed to public, sir.

328
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:08,326
Oh, that's all right, Officer.

329
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:12,825
Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

330
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:16,531
- Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
- That's okay.

331
00:31:42,364 --> 00:31:44,559
- Gittes! For Christ's sake!
- Loach.

332
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,861
- Get out of here before he sees you.
- What are you talking about?

333
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:49,267
- What's going on here?
- Loach!

334
00:31:50,906 --> 00:31:52,373
Hello, Jake.

335
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:55,039
Lou. How are you?

336
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:00,908
Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise, I'm okay.

337
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:05,179
- Yeah, summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.

338
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:06,720
There's no smoking here, sir...

339
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:09,689
That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception this time.

340
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:13,056
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

341
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:14,788
Thanks, Lou.

342
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,228
How'd you get past the guard?

343
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,796
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.

344
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,905
You look like
you've done well by yourself.

345
00:32:25,007 --> 00:32:26,031
I get by.

346
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:29,542
Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a man to find himself.

347
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:30,805
Maybe you have.

348
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:33,972
Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.

349
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:37,950
Yeah. Tell me,
you still putting Chinamen in jail

350
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:40,316
for spitting in the laundry?

351
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:43,319
You're a little behind the times, Jake.

352
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,483
They use steam irons now.

353
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:47,786
And I'm out of Chinatown.

354
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:49,896
Since when?

355
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:52,425
Since I made lieutenant.

356
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:54,766
Congratulations.

357
00:32:56,138 --> 00:32:59,733
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

358
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:00,967
Who?

359
00:33:01,543 --> 00:33:03,841
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

360
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:05,606
Yeah.

361
00:33:06,181 --> 00:33:08,240
I'd like to talk to him.

362
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,114
So you'd like to talk to him, huh?

363
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:14,588
You're welcome to try.

364
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,425
There he is.

365
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,141
Looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run-off channel.

366
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:42,516
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

367
00:33:43,852 --> 00:33:47,379
Obviously, the fall
must have knocked him unconscious.

368
00:33:49,224 --> 00:33:50,691
Mrs. Mulwray,

369
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:55,021
this alleged affair
your husband was having.

370
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:58,555
The publicity didn't make him

371
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:01,498
morose, or unhappy?

372
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:04,997
It didn't make him happy.

373
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:07,905
There is no possibility
that he would have taken his own life?

374
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:09,169
No.

375
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:12,838
Mrs. Mulwray,

376
00:34:13,882 --> 00:34:16,976
do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

377
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:19,411
No.

378
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:21,847
- Or where she might be?
- Certainly not.

379
00:34:21,957 --> 00:34:24,824
You and your husband
never discussed her?

380
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:27,721
He...

381
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,924
We did.

382
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:32,863
He wouldn't tell me her name.

383
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:37,600
We quarrelled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.

384
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,707
A complete surprise?

385
00:34:39,808 --> 00:34:42,333
I thought you hired
a private investigator.

386
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:45,579
A private investigator?

387
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:47,948
Mr. Gittes.

388
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:57,258
Yes, but I did that
because I thought I would put an end

389
00:34:57,392 --> 00:35:00,190
to a ridiculous rumor that had no basis.

390
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:04,896
When did Mr. Gittes inform you

391
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,560
that these rumors
had some foundation in fact?

392
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:10,866
Just before the story
broke in the papers, Lou.

393
00:35:11,973 --> 00:35:14,305
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find her?

394
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:15,535
No.

395
00:35:16,144 --> 00:35:18,305
- Or her name?
- No.

396
00:35:19,347 --> 00:35:20,405
Of course not.

397
00:35:20,515 --> 00:35:22,710
Will you need me
for anything else, Lieutenant?

398
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:24,979
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.

399
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,556
If we need any more information,
we'll be in touch.

400
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:31,955
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

401
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:36,162
I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.

402
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:42,266
- Jake, come on, what's the story?
- T ake it easy, guys. Let us get through.

403
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,735
We better do this in a hurry.

404
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,138
Let us through, guys!
Give us a little room!

405
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:51,007
You want a picture, guys? Here it is!

406
00:35:51,146 --> 00:35:53,114
"Gittes", two T's and an E.

407
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:57,680
Thank you for
going along with me back there.

408
00:35:58,186 --> 00:36:00,984
I just didn't want to explain anything.

409
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:03,319
I'll send you a check.

410
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:04,482
A check?

411
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:07,493
T o make it official that I've hired you.

412
00:36:23,678 --> 00:36:26,203
I'll get to him this afternoon if I can.

413
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:28,646
Jake, what are you doing here?

414
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,274
Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour.

415
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:33,115
Thought I'd drop by
and see who dropped dead lately.

416
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:35,018
Yeah? Isn't this something?

417
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:38,182
Middle of a drought,
and the Water Commissioner drowns.

418
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,817
- Only in L. A.
- Yeah.

419
00:36:41,096 --> 00:36:44,361
- Looks pretty banged up.
- Well, it's a long fall.

420
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:51,902
So how are you doing, Morty?

421
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:55,805
Never better, except for this darn cough.

422
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:58,141
- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.

423
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:07,917
Who you got there?

424
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:10,991
Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk.

425
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:14,422
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

426
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:17,728
Quite a character.

427
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:21,768
Lately he'd been living
in one of the downtown storm drains.

428
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:26,434
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

429
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:28,606
All right, there.

430
00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:37,208
Yeah. He drowned, too.

431
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,614
Come again?

432
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:43,349
Yeah. Got drunk, passed out
in the bottom of the riverbed.

433
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:44,948
The L. A. River?

434
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,718
Yeah, right under Hollenbeck Bridge.
What's wrong with that?

435
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,025
Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.

436
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:53,464
It's not completely dry.

437
00:37:53,602 --> 00:37:56,366
Well, he ain't gonna exactly
drown in a damp riverbed,

438
00:37:56,471 --> 00:37:58,530
no matter how soused he is.

439
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,268
We got water out of him. He drowned!

440
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:00,629
Hello.

441
00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:09,370
Howdy.

442
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:13,177
You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?

443
00:39:15,317 --> 00:39:16,511
Do you speak English?

444
00:39:21,222 --> 00:39:25,124
You were talking to a man
a few days ago. He wore glasses...

445
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,618
Yes.

446
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:30,327
What did you talk about,
do you mind my asking?

447
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:33,128
- The water.
- What about the water?

448
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:35,566
- When it comes.
- When it comes?

449
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:38,195
What did you tell him?

450
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,865
It comes in different parts of the river.

451
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:43,239
Every night a different part.

452
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:08,445
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn Florsheim shoe.

453
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:19,593
Hold it there, kitty-cat! Hold it!

454
00:42:25,574 --> 00:42:28,702
Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?

455
00:42:33,749 --> 00:42:36,582
You're a very nosy fellow, kitty-cat, huh?

456
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:38,448
You know what happens
to nosy fellows?

457
00:42:38,587 --> 00:42:42,455
No? Want to guess? No?

458
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:44,752
Okay. They lose their noses.

459
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:52,263
Next time you lose the whole thing.

460
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:55,132
Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.

461
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:57,631
Understand?

462
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:00,099
- Understand?
- Don't you understand, Gittes?

463
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:01,904
I understand.

464
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:03,410
All right.

465
00:43:14,356 --> 00:43:16,483
So some contractor
wants to build a dam,

466
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,093
and he makes a few payoffs. So what?

467
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:22,687
Think you can nail Mulvihill?
They'll claim you were trespassing.

468
00:43:22,832 --> 00:43:24,424
Don't want Mulvihill.

469
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:27,366
I want the big boys
that are making the payoffs.

470
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:28,834
Then what do you do?

471
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:30,598
Sue the shit out of them.

472
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:32,173
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

473
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:37,774
- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.

474
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:40,442
- Who?
- Ida Sessions.

475
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:44,516
Don't know her. T ake a number.

476
00:43:44,987 --> 00:43:46,318
Sue people like that,

477
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:50,722
they're liable to be having dinner
with the judge who's trying the suit.

478
00:43:51,227 --> 00:43:54,287
I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.

479
00:43:54,396 --> 00:43:56,330
She says you know her.

480
00:43:57,066 --> 00:43:58,192
Okay.

481
00:44:02,538 --> 00:44:05,871
Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

482
00:44:06,008 --> 00:44:07,873
Oh, yes, we have.

483
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,342
- Are you alone?
- lsn't everyone?

484
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:13,247
What can I do for you?

485
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,814
Well, I'm a working girl.

486
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:19,217
I didn't come in to see you on my own.

487
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:21,084
When did you come in?

488
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:24,750
I was the one who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray. Remember?

489
00:44:24,894 --> 00:44:27,488
- Shut the fuck up.
- Beg your pardon?

490
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:31,058
- Y es, I remember.
- Beg your pardon? Is something wrong?

491
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:35,365
No. I was just checking a detail
or two with my two associates.

492
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:36,563
Go on.

493
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:40,140
I never expected anything to happen
like what happened to Mr. Mulwray.

494
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:42,767
The point is, if it ever comes out,

495
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:45,881
I want somebody to know
that I didn 't know what would happen.

496
00:44:45,981 --> 00:44:47,471
I understand.

497
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:51,146
Who was your employer?
That could be helpful to both of us.

498
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:52,777
Oh, no! Oh, no.

499
00:44:53,355 --> 00:44:54,481
No.

500
00:44:55,991 --> 00:44:58,289
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.

501
00:44:58,427 --> 00:44:59,451
No, Mr. Gittes.

502
00:44:59,595 --> 00:45:02,621
Just look in the obituary column
of today's L. A. Post-Record.

503
00:45:02,765 --> 00:45:04,289
The obituary column?

504
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:08,164
- You'll find one of those people.
- "Those people"? Miss...

505
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,333
Sure.

506
00:45:12,474 --> 00:45:14,135
How do you like them apples?

507
00:45:45,074 --> 00:45:47,133
Ma'am.

508
00:45:51,547 --> 00:45:53,447
Thank you for coming.

509
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:02,948
- Yes, sir?
- Drink?

510
00:46:03,692 --> 00:46:06,160
T om Collins.
With lime, not lemon, please.

511
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:08,230
Tom Collins with lime.

512
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:14,024
I got your check in the mail.

513
00:46:14,169 --> 00:46:17,366
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.

514
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,705
Mrs. Mulwray,
I'm afraid that's not good enough.

515
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:27,242
How much would you like?

516
00:46:27,383 --> 00:46:30,409
Oh, stop it, the money's fine.
It's generous.

517
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:35,522
But I think you short-changed me
on the story.

518
00:46:36,392 --> 00:46:38,587
- I have?
- I think so.

519
00:46:38,727 --> 00:46:41,890
Something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

520
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:44,397
You were upset, but not that upset.

521
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:47,525
Mr. Gittes, don't tell me how I feel.

522
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:52,400
Sorry.

523
00:46:54,043 --> 00:46:58,446
Look, you sue me, your husband dies,
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato,

524
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,913
all of it quicker
than the wind from a duck's ass.

525
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:03,683
Excuse me.

526
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:09,185
- Then you ask me to lie to the police...
- lt wasn't much of a lie.

527
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:11,759
If your husband was killed, it was.

528
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:15,421
This could look like you paid me off
to withhold evidence.

529
00:47:15,564 --> 00:47:17,429
But he wasn't killed.

530
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:22,961
Mrs. Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.

531
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,372
Well,

532
00:47:31,246 --> 00:47:32,770
I suppose I am.

533
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:36,608
Actually, I knew about the affair.

534
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:40,554
- How did you find out?
- My husband.

535
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:42,123
He told you?

536
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:45,283
And you weren't the least bit upset?

537
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:47,219
I was grateful.

538
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:51,395
Mrs. Mulwray, you'll have to explain that.

539
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,626
Why?

540
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:55,735
Look, I do matrimonial work.
It's my metier.

541
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,773
When a wife tells me that she's happy
that her husband is cheating on her,

542
00:47:58,874 --> 00:48:01,434
it runs contrary to my experience.

543
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:03,511
Unless what?

544
00:48:06,215 --> 00:48:08,240
She was cheating on him.

545
00:48:10,886 --> 00:48:12,285
Were you?

546
00:48:17,393 --> 00:48:19,588
I dislike the word "cheat".

547
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:22,296
Did you have affairs?

548
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:25,094
- Mr. Gittes...
- Did he know about it?

549
00:48:26,635 --> 00:48:29,433
Well, I wouldn't run home and tell him
every time I went to bed with someone,

550
00:48:29,538 --> 00:48:31,597
if that's what you mean.

551
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:34,341
Is there anything else you want
to know about me?

552
00:48:34,743 --> 00:48:37,473
Where were you
when your husband died?

553
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,513
I can't tell you.

554
00:48:39,648 --> 00:48:41,172
You mean you don't know
where you were?

555
00:48:41,316 --> 00:48:44,615
- I mean I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone, too.

556
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,117
For very long?

557
00:48:48,223 --> 00:48:51,317
I don't see anyone
for very long, Mr. Gittes.

558
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:53,795
It's difficult for me.

559
00:48:56,765 --> 00:49:00,667
Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.

560
00:49:02,271 --> 00:49:03,329
I didn't want publicity.

561
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:06,738
I didn't want to go
into any of this, then or now.

562
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:08,836
Is that all?

563
00:49:13,048 --> 00:49:16,575
By the way,
what does this "C" stand for?

564
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:19,979
"Cross."

565
00:49:22,558 --> 00:49:24,890
- It's your maiden name?
- Yes.

566
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:26,520
Why?

567
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:28,661
No reason.

568
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:31,056
You must've had a reason
to ask me that.

569
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,031
No. I'm just a snoop.

570
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:42,273
No. I have my own car. The Packard.

571
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:44,276
Wait a minute, sonny.

572
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:46,540
I think you better come with me.

573
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:48,878
But why? There's nothing more to say.

574
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:51,248
Will you get my car, please?

575
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:55,287
Okay, go home.

576
00:49:55,424 --> 00:49:59,190
But in case you're interested,
your husband was murdered.

577
00:49:59,294 --> 00:50:01,558
Somebody's been dumping
thousands of tonnes of water

578
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:02,789
from the city's reservoirs,

579
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:05,263
and we're supposed to be
in the middle of a drought.

580
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,062
He found out about it, and he was killed.

581
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,035
There's a waterlogged drunk
in the morgue.

582
00:50:10,138 --> 00:50:12,606
Involuntary manslaughter,
if anybody wants to take the trouble,

583
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:13,765
which they don't.

584
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:16,104
It seems like half the city
is trying to cover it all up,

585
00:50:16,245 --> 00:50:18,076
which is fine by me.

586
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:20,904
But, Mrs. Mulwray,

587
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:23,314
I goddamn near lost my nose,

588
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:24,714
and I like it.

589
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,720
I like breathing through it.

590
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:29,985
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

591
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,463
Mr. Gittes...

592
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:53,079
J. J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

593
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:26,178
Mr. Yelburton will be busy
for some time.

594
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:29,984
Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.

595
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:33,217
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

596
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:35,948
I take a long lunch hour.

597
00:51:37,593 --> 00:51:39,993
All day, sometimes.

598
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:42,412
Noah Cross worked
for the Water Department.

599
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:43,854
Yes.

600
00:52:43,959 --> 00:52:46,223
- No.
- Well, did he or didn't he?

601
00:52:46,328 --> 00:52:48,296
He owned it.

602
00:52:49,598 --> 00:52:52,066
He owned the Water Department?

603
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:53,293
Yes.

604
00:52:54,836 --> 00:52:58,636
You mean, he owned
the entire water supply for the city?

605
00:52:58,774 --> 00:52:59,900
Yes.

606
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:07,709
How did they get it away from him?

607
00:53:07,816 --> 00:53:11,252
Mr. Mulwray felt
the public should own the water.

608
00:53:11,353 --> 00:53:13,116
Mr. Mulwray?

609
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:15,815
I thought you said Cross owned it.

610
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:17,891
Along with Mr. Mulwray.

611
00:53:19,027 --> 00:53:22,929
- They were partners?
- Yes! Yes, they were partners.

612
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:03,330
Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

613
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,140
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.

614
00:54:11,246 --> 00:54:14,443
These staff meetings,
they just go on and on.

615
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:18,781
Yeah. Must be especially tough
to take over under these circumstances.

616
00:54:18,887 --> 00:54:22,880
Yes. Hollis was the best
department chief the city's ever had.

617
00:54:23,658 --> 00:54:25,956
My goodness,
what happened to your nose?

618
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:27,858
Cut myself shaving.

619
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,022
Well, you ought to be more careful.
That must really smart.

620
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:33,998
Only when I breathe.

621
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,174
Only when you breathe.

622
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:43,845
Don't tell me you're still working
for Mrs. Mulwray.

623
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:46,311
- I never was.
- I don't understand.

624
00:54:47,382 --> 00:54:49,247
Neither do l, actually.

625
00:54:49,384 --> 00:54:50,874
You hired me.

626
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:54,253
Or you hired that chippy to hire me.

627
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,984
Mr. Gittes, you're not making
a bit of sense.

628
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,255
Well, let's look at it this way.

629
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:03,557
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.

630
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:05,893
He had a reputation
that was hard to get around.

631
00:55:06,034 --> 00:55:07,831
You decided to ruin it.

632
00:55:07,936 --> 00:55:11,269
Then he found out
you were dumping water at night.

633
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,530
Then he was...

634
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:15,204
Drowned.

635
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:18,944
Mr. Gittes,
that's an outrageous accusation.

636
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,378
I don't know what you're talking about.

637
00:55:21,483 --> 00:55:25,283
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.

638
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,945
Dumping thousands of gallons of water
down the toilet

639
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:30,922
in the middle of a drought, that's news.

640
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:34,386
Mr. Gittes,

641
00:55:35,397 --> 00:55:36,694
we're...

642
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:41,293
We're not anxious for this to get around,
but we have been diverting a little water

643
00:55:41,436 --> 00:55:44,405
to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

644
00:55:44,506 --> 00:55:47,202
As you know, the farmers out there
have no legal right to our water,

645
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:48,901
but we've been trying to help
some of them out,

646
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,944
keep them from going under.

647
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:54,776
Naturally, when you divert water,
there's a little run-off.

648
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,975
Yeah. A little run-off.

649
00:55:57,819 --> 00:56:01,482
- Where'd you say those groves were?
- ln the Northwest Valley.

650
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:04,387
That's like saying they're in Arizona.

651
00:56:04,793 --> 00:56:09,287
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out.
I can't give you the exact location.

652
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:12,460
- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yes.

653
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:15,570
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?

654
00:56:16,371 --> 00:56:17,599
Yes.

655
00:56:17,706 --> 00:56:19,799
I don't want to nail you.

656
00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:27,477
I want to find out who put you up to it.

657
00:56:27,616 --> 00:56:29,846
I'll give you a few days to think about it.

658
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:31,816
Call me. I can help.

659
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,612
Who knows?

660
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:37,283
Maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big-shots,

661
00:56:37,392 --> 00:56:38,984
and you can stay
the head of the department

662
00:56:39,127 --> 00:56:40,992
for the next 20 years.

663
00:57:22,704 --> 00:57:25,070
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

664
00:57:30,412 --> 00:57:32,539
What is your usual salary?

665
00:57:33,448 --> 00:57:37,407
$35 a day, plus 20 to my associates,

666
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:39,677
plus expenses,

667
00:57:40,622 --> 00:57:43,022
plus a bonus if I show results.

668
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:50,092
Whoever is behind my husband's death,
why have they gone to all this trouble?

669
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:51,425
Money.

670
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,860
How they plan to make it
out of emptying reservoirs,

671
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,699
that I don't know.

672
00:57:57,072 --> 00:57:58,869
I'll pay your salary,

673
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:00,601
plus $5,000

674
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:05,045
if you find out what happened to Hollis,
and who is involved.

675
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:13,548
Sophie, draw up one of our
standard contracts for Mrs. Mulwray.

676
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:15,384
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

677
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:21,252
T ell me something.

678
00:58:21,396 --> 00:58:24,365
Did you get married before or after
Mulwray and your father

679
00:58:24,466 --> 00:58:26,593
sold the Water Department?

680
00:58:27,002 --> 00:58:29,630
Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?

681
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,932
Yes, of course.

682
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:36,476
It was sometime after.

683
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:40,778
I was just out of grade school
when they did that.

684
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,715
Then you married
your father's business partner.

685
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,459
You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.

686
00:58:53,194 --> 00:58:57,130
Does my talking about your father
upset you?

687
00:58:57,265 --> 00:58:58,562
Why, no.

688
00:58:59,834 --> 00:59:01,392
Yes. A little.

689
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,596
You see, Hollis and my...

690
00:59:05,173 --> 00:59:06,231
My father

691
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:08,968
had a falling-out finally.

692
00:59:10,345 --> 00:59:13,314
Over you
or over the Water Department?

693
00:59:13,448 --> 00:59:15,609
Not over me. Why should it be over me?

694
00:59:15,717 --> 00:59:17,344
Then it was over
the Water Department.

695
00:59:17,485 --> 00:59:18,474
Yes.

696
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:22,155
Hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public,

697
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:26,021
and I don't think my father felt that way.

698
00:59:26,694 --> 00:59:29,322
Actually, it was over
the Van der Lip Dam.

699
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:30,761
You know, the dam that broke?

700
00:59:30,865 --> 00:59:34,198
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it.

701
00:59:34,335 --> 00:59:38,533
- Never forgave him for what?
- For talking him into building it.

702
00:59:38,673 --> 00:59:41,267
They never spoke from that time on.

703
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:47,144
You sure about that?

704
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:49,846
Of course I'm sure.

705
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:56,020
Sign here.

706
00:59:57,525 --> 00:59:59,322
The copy's for you.

707
01:01:01,422 --> 01:01:03,856
- Mr. Gitts?
- Gittes.

708
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:06,417
How do you do?

709
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:10,761
You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gitts.
I like that.

710
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:12,725
Thanks.

711
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:14,734
If you were a bank president,
that would be one thing,

712
01:01:14,836 --> 01:01:16,929
but in your business, it's admirable.

713
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:18,970
And it's good advertising.

714
01:01:19,107 --> 01:01:20,131
It doesn't hurt.

715
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:23,574
It's why you attracted
a client like my daughter.

716
01:01:24,412 --> 01:01:25,470
Probably.

717
01:01:25,613 --> 01:01:27,444
But I'm surprised
you're still working for her,

718
01:01:27,582 --> 01:01:30,050
unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

719
01:01:30,151 --> 01:01:34,212
No. She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

720
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:38,250
How'd she get that idea?

721
01:01:38,826 --> 01:01:40,919
I think I gave it to her.

722
01:01:42,096 --> 01:01:45,964
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

723
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,331
Fine. Long as you don't serve
chicken that way.

724
01:01:51,439 --> 01:01:54,636
T ell me, what do the police say?

725
01:01:54,776 --> 01:01:57,108
They're calling it an accident.

726
01:01:58,213 --> 01:02:02,240
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant.

727
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,910
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah.

728
01:02:05,453 --> 01:02:06,852
Where from?

729
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:10,419
We used to work together.
In Chinatown.

730
01:02:12,393 --> 01:02:14,827
Would you call him a capable man?

731
01:02:15,663 --> 01:02:16,823
Very.

732
01:02:17,332 --> 01:02:18,594
Honest?

733
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:20,366
As far as it goes.

734
01:02:21,236 --> 01:02:24,330
Of course, he has to swim
in the same water we all do.

735
01:02:24,472 --> 01:02:28,033
Of course, but you've no reason to think
he's bungled the case?

736
01:02:28,176 --> 01:02:30,474
- None.
- That's too bad.

737
01:02:31,412 --> 01:02:32,777
T oo bad?

738
01:02:33,548 --> 01:02:37,143
It disturbs me. Makes me think
you're taking my daughter for a ride.

739
01:02:37,252 --> 01:02:39,686
Financially speaking, of course.

740
01:02:40,655 --> 01:02:42,714
What are you charging her?

741
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:48,518
My usual fee,
plus a bonus if I get results.

742
01:02:48,663 --> 01:02:50,722
Are you sleeping with her?

743
01:02:53,268 --> 01:02:54,326
Come, come, Mr. Gitts.

744
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:58,132
You don't have to think about that
to remember, do you?

745
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:02,001
If you want an answer
to that question, Mr. Cross,

746
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,704
I'll put one of my men on the job.

747
01:03:06,281 --> 01:03:08,078
- Good afternoon.
- Mr. Gitts...

748
01:03:08,216 --> 01:03:09,877
- Gittes.
- Gittes.

749
01:03:10,685 --> 01:03:13,882
You're dealing with a disturbed woman
who just lost her husband.

750
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:16,422
I don't want her taken advantage of.

751
01:03:16,557 --> 01:03:18,388
- Sit down.
- What for?

752
01:03:21,129 --> 01:03:24,496
You may think you know
what you're dealing with,

753
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:26,726
but believe me, you don't.

754
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:29,430
Why is that funny?

755
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:32,698
It's what the District Attorney
used to tell me in Chinatown.

756
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:34,604
Yeah? Was he right?

757
01:03:35,977 --> 01:03:38,946
Exactly what do you know about me?
Sit down.

758
01:03:44,652 --> 01:03:46,415
Mainly that you're rich,

759
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:50,115
and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

760
01:03:50,258 --> 01:03:52,886
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.

761
01:03:54,595 --> 01:03:56,358
Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores

762
01:03:56,464 --> 01:03:59,558
all get respectable
if they last long enough.

763
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:03,399
I'll double whatever your fee is
and pay you $10,000

764
01:04:03,504 --> 01:04:05,904
if you find Hollis' girlfriend.

765
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:09,137
- Girlfriend?
- Disappeared, hasn't she?

766
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:10,437
Yeah.

767
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:13,704
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

768
01:04:13,815 --> 01:04:15,043
Maybe.

769
01:04:16,818 --> 01:04:17,807
If Mulwray was murdered,

770
01:04:17,952 --> 01:04:21,149
she'd be one of the last
to have seen him alive.

771
01:04:21,456 --> 01:04:24,152
When's the last time you saw Mulwray?

772
01:04:25,593 --> 01:04:27,891
Sheriff's gold posse.
Bunch of damn fools

773
01:04:27,995 --> 01:04:31,954
who pay $5,000 apiece
towards the Sheriff's re-election.

774
01:04:32,533 --> 01:04:34,967
I let them practice up out here.

775
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:37,297
Yeah.

776
01:04:39,006 --> 01:04:41,941
Do you remember the last time
you saw Mulwray?

777
01:04:42,043 --> 01:04:44,568
At my age, you tend to forget.

778
01:04:46,013 --> 01:04:48,675
It was five days ago outside
The Pig'n Whistle,

779
01:04:48,816 --> 01:04:51,512
and you had one hell of an argument.

780
01:04:51,652 --> 01:04:55,611
I got the pictures in my office,
if that'll help you remember.

781
01:04:58,693 --> 01:05:01,685
- What was the argument about?
- My daughter.

782
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:05,156
What about her?

783
01:05:05,733 --> 01:05:09,533
Just find the girl, Mr. Gitts.

784
01:05:12,673 --> 01:05:16,632
I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.

785
01:05:17,578 --> 01:05:19,637
I'd like to help her if I can.

786
01:05:19,747 --> 01:05:23,615
I had no idea you and Hollis
were that fond of one another.

787
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:26,850
Hollis Mulwray made this city,

788
01:05:27,555 --> 01:05:29,648
and he made me a fortune.

789
01:05:31,392 --> 01:05:34,520
We were a lot closer
than Evelyn realized.

790
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:41,961
If you want to hire me, I still have to
know what the argument was about.

791
01:05:43,204 --> 01:05:45,468
My daughter's a very jealous woman.

792
01:05:45,573 --> 01:05:48,633
I didn't want her to find out
about the girl.

793
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,707
How did you find out?

794
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:55,077
I still got a few teeth left in my head,
and a few friends in town.

795
01:05:58,085 --> 01:05:59,177
Okay.

796
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:02,183
I'll...

797
01:06:03,624 --> 01:06:06,559
I'll have my secretary
draw up the papers.

798
01:06:07,261 --> 01:06:08,523
T ell me,

799
01:06:09,697 --> 01:06:13,724
are you frightened for the girl
or what Evelyn might do to her?

800
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:15,665
Just find the girl.

801
01:06:17,205 --> 01:06:18,900
I'll look into it,

802
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,168
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

803
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:24,668
Orange groves?

804
01:06:25,713 --> 01:06:28,011
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

805
01:06:33,254 --> 01:06:35,245
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could you tell me

806
01:06:35,389 --> 01:06:38,085
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

807
01:06:38,226 --> 01:06:40,023
Part of it's in Ventura County.

808
01:06:40,127 --> 01:06:43,563
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

809
01:06:44,065 --> 01:06:47,228
Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.

810
01:06:48,102 --> 01:06:49,797
Row 23, section C.

811
01:06:54,308 --> 01:06:55,536
Weasel.

812
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:52,431
Say, sonny,

813
01:07:54,669 --> 01:07:58,298
why do they have all those names
pasted in the plat books?

814
01:07:58,406 --> 01:08:01,864
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded within the week.

815
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:05,137
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

816
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:09,805
Well, that means that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.

817
01:08:09,917 --> 01:08:11,885
If that's what it says.

818
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:16,182
Can I check one of these volumes out?

819
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:21,185
Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.

820
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:24,230
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

821
01:08:25,266 --> 01:08:28,497
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

822
01:08:28,603 --> 01:08:31,197
I'd like to be able to read across.

823
01:08:43,117 --> 01:08:44,709
Why, thank you.

824
01:09:51,919 --> 01:09:53,648
Hold it right there!

825
01:11:02,223 --> 01:11:04,521
All right, quit it. Quit, now!

826
01:11:04,658 --> 01:11:07,149
Search the man. See if he's armed.

827
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:23,404
I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!

828
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:25,812
Search him. Search him!

829
01:11:27,014 --> 01:11:28,743
He ain't armed.

830
01:11:28,883 --> 01:11:30,350
All right, mister, who you with,

831
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:33,579
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

832
01:11:34,421 --> 01:11:35,911
- Get away from me!
- Answer him!

833
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:37,421
You come near me
with that thing again,

834
01:11:37,558 --> 01:11:38,582
you're gonna need a pair of them!

835
01:11:38,726 --> 01:11:40,523
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

836
01:11:40,628 --> 01:11:44,530
I said cut that out! Give the man
a chance to say something!

837
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:51,898
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.

838
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:53,700
I'm not with either one of them.

839
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:57,275
Then what you doing out here, mister?

840
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,602
A client hired me to see...

841
01:12:00,714 --> 01:12:03,444
T o see if the Water Department
was irrigating your land.

842
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:05,245
Irrigating my land?

843
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:06,944
The Water Department's been sending
you people out here

844
01:12:07,087 --> 01:12:09,783
to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down three of my wells.

845
01:12:09,924 --> 01:12:12,017
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

846
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:14,856
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

847
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,366
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

848
01:12:21,468 --> 01:12:24,437
Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us.

849
01:12:24,572 --> 01:12:29,100
Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.

850
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:37,950
Well, that's that.

851
01:13:05,705 --> 01:13:07,332
What's going on?

852
01:13:07,808 --> 01:13:09,435
You didn't look too good,

853
01:13:09,543 --> 01:13:12,512
so we thought we better call
your employer.

854
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:18,813
Thanks for coming.

855
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:26,084
- That dam's a con job.
- What dam?

856
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:29,924
The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L. A. into building it.

857
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,760
But the water's not gonna go to L. A.,
it's coming right here.

858
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:34,026
To the Valley?

859
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:36,601
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.

860
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:39,194
I was at the Hall of Records today.

861
01:13:45,412 --> 01:13:49,178
In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,

862
01:13:49,316 --> 01:13:52,979
Emma Dill, 12,000,
Clarence Speer, 5,000,

863
01:13:53,086 --> 01:13:56,283
and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.

864
01:13:56,389 --> 01:13:58,357
- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?

865
01:13:58,492 --> 01:14:02,189
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.

866
01:14:02,329 --> 01:14:04,126
They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

867
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,664
and then picking it up for peanuts.

868
01:14:05,765 --> 01:14:10,327
You have any idea what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

869
01:14:10,437 --> 01:14:13,406
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

870
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:18,575
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

871
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,377
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

872
01:14:23,216 --> 01:14:25,184
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

873
01:14:27,721 --> 01:14:29,416
- We got it!
- What?

874
01:14:29,556 --> 01:14:31,080
- We got it.
- What? What is it?

875
01:14:31,224 --> 01:14:34,216
"A memorial service was held
at the Mar Vista lnn today

876
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:35,419
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

877
01:14:35,562 --> 01:14:37,928
He passed away two weeks ago.

878
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:40,593
Why is that unusual?

879
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:44,764
He passed away two weeks ago,
and one week ago he bought the land.

880
01:14:44,905 --> 01:14:46,497
That's unusual.

881
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:33,650
Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?

882
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:35,917
Yes, I hope so.

883
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,621
It's Dad.

884
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:40,752
I can't seem to handle him anymore.

885
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,158
- Can l, sweetheart?
- My goodness.

886
01:15:43,296 --> 01:15:45,764
Nothing with Dad. It's me.

887
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:48,457
Oh, no, no, Dad is an absolute angel
with everyone else.

888
01:15:48,602 --> 01:15:51,628
- It's just that he and my...
- Oh, I don't know.

889
01:15:51,771 --> 01:15:54,604
Of course, I'm anxious
for him to have the best,

890
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,471
and money is no object.

891
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:59,306
Perhaps if we met with your father.

892
01:15:59,946 --> 01:16:02,642
- There is one question.
- Of course.

893
01:16:02,782 --> 01:16:05,910
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

894
01:16:06,653 --> 01:16:08,518
I'm sorry, but we don't.

895
01:16:08,655 --> 01:16:10,282
Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.

896
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:13,325
We just wanted to be sure,
didn't we, hon?

897
01:16:13,493 --> 01:16:17,759
Would it be possible for me to see
a list of your patients, just to be certain?

898
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:21,960
We never reveal the names
of our guests as a matter of policy.

899
01:16:22,068 --> 01:16:24,161
You would appreciate that
if your father came to live with us.

900
01:16:24,304 --> 01:16:27,501
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear you say.

901
01:16:27,641 --> 01:16:28,699
Good.

902
01:16:28,842 --> 01:16:31,174
I wonder, is it too late
for us to have a look around?

903
01:16:31,311 --> 01:16:32,539
No. Allow me to show you.

904
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:35,273
Would you mind
if we took a stroll on our own?

905
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,782
Just if you'll confine yourself
to the main building.

906
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:39,613
It's almost bedtime.

907
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:42,950
We understand. Come, my sweet.

908
01:16:55,368 --> 01:16:57,962
Charlie! You ought to know
better than that!

909
01:16:58,071 --> 01:17:00,005
Sit down. Have a chair.

910
01:17:19,726 --> 01:17:22,854
They're all there. Every goddamn name.

911
01:17:28,968 --> 01:17:32,495
You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000-acre empire.

912
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:34,095
They can't be.

913
01:17:38,645 --> 01:17:41,239
They may not know it, but they are.

914
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:44,610
- Hello, girls.
- Hello.

915
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:47,219
- Hello.
- Are any of you Emma Dill?

916
01:17:48,922 --> 01:17:51,550
- Yes? Are you Emma?
- Yes.

917
01:17:51,658 --> 01:17:54,218
Well, I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

918
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:55,351
Why?

919
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:57,623
Did you know you were
a very wealthy woman?

920
01:17:57,764 --> 01:17:59,561
Oh, I'm not.

921
01:17:59,666 --> 01:18:03,727
- Yes, you are. You own a lot of land.
- No more.

922
01:18:04,571 --> 01:18:05,765
Some time ago,

923
01:18:05,905 --> 01:18:09,898
my late husband owned a good deal
of beach property at Long Beach,

924
01:18:10,009 --> 01:18:11,601
but we lost it.

925
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:14,603
- That's very beautiful.
- Thanks.

926
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:17,283
Where did you get
this piece of material?

927
01:18:17,417 --> 01:18:19,282
At the Abbacore Club.

928
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:23,214
- Abbacore?
- No. The Albacore.

929
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:25,257
It's a fish.

930
01:18:25,358 --> 01:18:30,057
My grandson is a member,
and they take very nice care of us.

931
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:32,063
How do they do that?

932
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:36,261
Oh, give us things,
not just like this old flag, but...

933
01:18:36,836 --> 01:18:37,825
But what?

934
01:18:37,971 --> 01:18:41,270
We're a sort of unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes.

935
01:18:42,442 --> 01:18:46,503
Would you come with me, please?
Someone wants to talk with you.

936
01:18:49,282 --> 01:18:50,271
Goodbye, ladies.

937
01:18:50,383 --> 01:18:51,407
- Bye!
- Bye!

938
01:18:59,659 --> 01:19:02,651
Come on.
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.

939
01:19:02,796 --> 01:19:04,957
Can we leave the lady out of this?

940
01:19:05,064 --> 01:19:08,261
- Yeah. Why not?
- I'd like to see her to the car.

941
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:11,098
- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.

942
01:19:11,838 --> 01:19:13,430
Get in the car.

943
01:20:34,087 --> 01:20:35,782
Maid's night off?

944
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:39,717
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

945
01:20:39,826 --> 01:20:43,762
- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.

946
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,792
Easy. It's an innocent question.

947
01:20:46,933 --> 01:20:49,959
No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.

948
01:20:50,103 --> 01:20:51,968
I guess you're right.

949
01:20:55,074 --> 01:20:56,939
T o you, Mrs. Mulwray.

950
01:20:58,311 --> 01:21:00,779
Frankly, tonight, you saved my...

951
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,877
You saved my neck.

952
01:21:06,019 --> 01:21:07,816
T ell me, Mr. Gittes,

953
01:21:09,188 --> 01:21:11,554
does this often happen to you?

954
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:14,626
What's that?

955
01:21:15,528 --> 01:21:18,292
Well, I'm judging only on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening,

956
01:21:18,431 --> 01:21:20,592
but if this is how you go
about your work,

957
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:24,466
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

958
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:28,936
Actually, this hasn't happened to me
for a long time.

959
01:21:29,042 --> 01:21:31,010
When was the last time?

960
01:21:31,644 --> 01:21:32,736
Why?

961
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:35,606
It's an innocent question.

962
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,619
- ln Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

963
01:21:45,992 --> 01:21:49,450
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

964
01:21:49,562 --> 01:21:51,291
As little as possible.

965
01:21:51,397 --> 01:21:54,855
The District Attorney gives his men
advice like that?

966
01:21:55,735 --> 01:21:57,635
They do in Chinatown.

967
01:21:58,805 --> 01:22:01,365
Why did you leave the police force?

968
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:10,472
Do you have any peroxide,
or anything like that?

969
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:13,143
Surely. Will you come this way?

970
01:22:30,536 --> 01:22:32,231
My God!

971
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:37,403
It's a nasty cut.

972
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:41,073
I had no idea...

973
01:22:46,185 --> 01:22:47,345
Sorry!

974
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:49,816
There.

975
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:52,414
Is it painful?

976
01:22:55,928 --> 01:22:57,691
It must be painful.

977
01:22:59,732 --> 01:23:01,222
What's wrong?

978
01:23:02,068 --> 01:23:03,365
Your eye.

979
01:23:06,706 --> 01:23:08,435
What about it? What?

980
01:23:09,075 --> 01:23:12,602
There's something black
in the green part of your eye.

981
01:23:13,379 --> 01:23:14,505
Oh, that.

982
01:23:15,081 --> 01:23:19,347
It's a flaw in the iris.

983
01:23:20,653 --> 01:23:22,780
- A flaw?
- Yes.

984
01:23:24,157 --> 01:23:26,216
A sort of birthmark.

985
01:24:02,028 --> 01:24:03,996
Did you wear a uniform?

986
01:24:05,698 --> 01:24:07,097
Sometimes.

987
01:24:09,168 --> 01:24:11,432
Must have looked cute in blue.

988
01:24:13,473 --> 01:24:15,498
Give me a break, will you?

989
01:24:16,042 --> 01:24:17,737
I don't know you.

990
01:24:19,045 --> 01:24:21,411
I want to know more about you.

991
01:24:21,981 --> 01:24:23,278
Not now.

992
01:24:25,551 --> 01:24:29,009
You really don't like to talk
about the past, do you?

993
01:24:31,557 --> 01:24:32,922
I'm tired.

994
01:24:33,793 --> 01:24:36,762
No. Why does it bother you
to talk about it?

995
01:24:37,396 --> 01:24:40,593
- lt bothers everybody that works there.
- Where?

996
01:24:41,634 --> 01:24:43,465
Chinatown. Everybody.

997
01:24:44,766 --> 01:24:46,466
To me, it was just bad luck.

998
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:48,547
Why?

999
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:54,155
You can't always tell what's going on.

1000
01:24:56,297 --> 01:24:57,821
Like with you.

1001
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:08,773
Why was...

1002
01:25:11,145 --> 01:25:12,942
Why was it bad luck?

1003
01:25:17,785 --> 01:25:20,845
I was trying to keep someone
from being hurt.

1004
01:25:21,522 --> 01:25:24,423
I ended up making sure
that she was hurt.

1005
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,260
Was there a woman involved?

1006
01:25:37,037 --> 01:25:38,436
Of course.

1007
01:25:40,074 --> 01:25:41,200
Dead?

1008
01:25:54,588 --> 01:25:55,953
Yes, hello?

1009
01:25:58,859 --> 01:26:02,659
Oh, my God.
No, look, don't do anything.

1010
01:26:02,763 --> 01:26:05,357
Don't do anything until I get there.

1011
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:12,233
I have to go.

1012
01:26:12,907 --> 01:26:16,570
- Where?
- Just that I have to.

1013
01:26:17,111 --> 01:26:21,047
- I want to know where you're going.
- No, please. Don't be angry.

1014
01:26:21,182 --> 01:26:24,049
It has nothing to do with you
or with any of all of this. It's just...

1015
01:26:24,185 --> 01:26:26,551
- Where are you going?
- Please...

1016
01:26:29,523 --> 01:26:31,252
Trust me this much.

1017
01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:43,402
I'll be back.

1018
01:26:48,909 --> 01:26:50,433
And there is...

1019
01:26:52,213 --> 01:26:54,841
There is something
that I should tell you about.

1020
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:59,181
The fishing club
that old lady mentioned...

1021
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:03,780
- The pieces of the flag... Yes.
- The Albacore Club.

1022
01:27:03,924 --> 01:27:06,552
- lt has to do with my father.
- I know.

1023
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:09,185
He owns it... You know?

1024
01:27:10,164 --> 01:27:11,529
I saw him.

1025
01:27:15,135 --> 01:27:16,568
You saw

1026
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:18,868
my father?

1027
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:25,210
- What... When?
- This morning.

1028
01:27:28,315 --> 01:27:30,044
You didn't tell me.

1029
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:32,908
Well, there hasn't been much time.

1030
01:27:33,454 --> 01:27:34,614
What...

1031
01:27:35,356 --> 01:27:36,983
What did he say?

1032
01:27:42,496 --> 01:27:44,088
What did he say?

1033
01:27:44,632 --> 01:27:46,566
That you were jealous.

1034
01:27:48,168 --> 01:27:50,159
And that he was afraid
what you might do.

1035
01:27:50,304 --> 01:27:52,465
Do? To whom?

1036
01:27:53,707 --> 01:27:56,005
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one.

1037
01:27:58,445 --> 01:28:00,777
He wanted to know where she was.

1038
01:28:03,984 --> 01:28:05,975
I want you to listen to me.

1039
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:10,648
Now, my father is
a very dangerous man.

1040
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:14,420
You don't know how dangerous.
You don't know how crazy.

1041
01:28:15,629 --> 01:28:18,996
Are you trying to tell me
that he might be behind all this?

1042
01:28:19,133 --> 01:28:20,623
It's possible.

1043
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:29,701
Even the death of your husband?

1044
01:28:29,843 --> 01:28:31,333
It's possible.

1045
01:28:31,578 --> 01:28:33,808
Now, please,
don't ask me any more questions now,

1046
01:28:33,914 --> 01:28:36,041
just wait. Wait for me here.

1047
01:28:37,184 --> 01:28:38,845
I need you here.

1048
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:49,406
No, no. Here.

1049
01:32:18,872 --> 01:32:20,533
Give me the keys.

1050
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:23,867
You...

1051
01:32:23,977 --> 01:32:27,413
It's either that
or you drive yourself to the police.

1052
01:32:27,548 --> 01:32:28,913
The police?

1053
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,912
Come on, Mrs. Mulwray.

1054
01:32:31,051 --> 01:32:34,612
You've got your husband's girlfriend
tied up in there.

1055
01:32:34,755 --> 01:32:37,053
- She's not tied up.
- You know what I mean.

1056
01:32:37,157 --> 01:32:40,388
- You're holding her against her will.
- I am not!

1057
01:32:41,461 --> 01:32:44,191
- Okay. Then let's go talk to her.
- No!

1058
01:32:45,933 --> 01:32:47,195
She's...

1059
01:32:47,434 --> 01:32:49,095
She's too upset.

1060
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:52,303
What about?

1061
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:54,463
Hollis's death.

1062
01:32:55,576 --> 01:32:56,770
I tried to keep it from her.

1063
01:32:56,910 --> 01:33:01,404
I didn't want her to know until
I could make plans for us to leave.

1064
01:33:01,515 --> 01:33:04,211
You mean she just found out about it?

1065
01:33:06,353 --> 01:33:09,288
That's not what it looks like,
Mrs. Mulwray.

1066
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:11,658
What does it look like?

1067
01:33:11,858 --> 01:33:14,986
Like she knows more
than you want her to tell.

1068
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:18,122
You're insane.

1069
01:33:18,265 --> 01:33:20,756
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police.

1070
01:33:20,867 --> 01:33:24,496
I don't care what you've done.
I don't want to hurt you.

1071
01:33:28,642 --> 01:33:30,974
You won't go to the police if I tell you?

1072
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:32,908
I will if you don't.

1073
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:48,288
She...

1074
01:33:48,395 --> 01:33:49,623
She...

1075
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:51,656
She...

1076
01:33:52,966 --> 01:33:54,593
She's my sister.

1077
01:34:01,008 --> 01:34:02,498
Take it easy.

1078
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:06,108
If she's your sister, she's your sister.

1079
01:34:06,747 --> 01:34:08,544
Why all the secrecy?

1080
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:11,979
I can't.

1081
01:34:12,085 --> 01:34:16,681
Is it because of Hollis? Because she
was seeing your husband? Is that it?

1082
01:34:20,761 --> 01:34:23,229
I would never have harmed Hollis.

1083
01:34:24,231 --> 01:34:27,997
He was the most gentle,
decent man imaginable.

1084
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:34,172
And he put up with more from me
than you'll ever know.

1085
01:34:36,543 --> 01:34:40,240
I wanted him to be happy.

1086
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:03,363
I borrowed your husband's car.
I'll bring it back in the morning.

1087
01:35:03,937 --> 01:35:06,235
But aren't you going...
Coming back with me?

1088
01:35:06,373 --> 01:35:09,274
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anybody about this.

1089
01:35:11,278 --> 01:35:13,246
That's not what I meant.

1090
01:35:16,616 --> 01:35:17,742
Yeah.

1091
01:35:18,652 --> 01:35:22,349
Well, I'm tired, Mrs. Mulwray.

1092
01:35:23,557 --> 01:35:24,956
Good night.

1093
01:36:30,357 --> 01:36:31,585
Gittes?

1094
01:36:32,959 --> 01:36:34,449
- Gittes?
- Yeah?

1095
01:36:35,028 --> 01:36:37,360
Ida Sessions wants to see you.

1096
01:36:37,497 --> 01:36:41,160
- Who?
- Ida Sessions. You remember Ida.

1097
01:36:42,702 --> 01:36:44,932
- Yeah, I do?
- Sure, you do.

1098
01:36:48,475 --> 01:36:50,340
I tell you what, pal.

1099
01:36:51,478 --> 01:36:55,812
If lda wants to see me,
she can call me at my office.

1100
01:37:22,742 --> 01:37:27,304
848- 1/2 East Kensington. Echo Park.

1101
01:37:27,414 --> 01:37:30,474
She begged me to call.
She's waiting for you.

1102
01:40:37,937 --> 01:40:40,497
Find anything interesting, Gittes?

1103
01:40:44,778 --> 01:40:46,837
What are you doing around here?

1104
01:40:46,946 --> 01:40:48,743
Didn't you call me?

1105
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:52,916
How come you happen to know her?

1106
01:40:53,319 --> 01:40:54,616
I don't.

1107
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:00,220
Come here.
I want to show you something.

1108
01:41:09,502 --> 01:41:12,437
- lsn't that your phone number?
- ls it?

1109
01:41:12,572 --> 01:41:14,767
I forget. I don't call myself that often.

1110
01:41:14,908 --> 01:41:17,900
Well, just to make sure,
we had Loach here give you a call.

1111
01:41:18,011 --> 01:41:19,638
What happened to your nose, Gittes?

1112
01:41:19,779 --> 01:41:21,906
Somebody slam
a bedroom window on it?

1113
01:41:24,584 --> 01:41:28,247
Nope. Your wife got excited.
She crossed her legs a little too quick.

1114
01:41:28,354 --> 01:41:30,219
You understand what I mean, pal?

1115
01:41:31,124 --> 01:41:32,284
Loach.

1116
01:41:52,712 --> 01:41:54,475
They look familiar?

1117
01:41:55,682 --> 01:41:58,981
- Yeah. I took them. So what?
- How did she happen to have them?

1118
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:02,680
Either you tell me or I guess.
I don't know the answer.

1119
01:42:03,056 --> 01:42:05,320
You must really think I'm stupid,
don't you, Gittes?

1120
01:42:05,458 --> 01:42:06,857
I don't think about it that much,

1121
01:42:06,993 --> 01:42:09,985
but give me a day or two
and I'll get back to you.

1122
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:13,622
- Now I'd like to go home.
- I want the other pictures, Gittes.

1123
01:42:13,733 --> 01:42:15,257
What pictures?

1124
01:42:16,035 --> 01:42:19,471
This broad hired you,
not Evelyn Mulwray.

1125
01:42:19,572 --> 01:42:21,005
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1126
01:42:22,142 --> 01:42:23,803
Somebody wanted
to shake Mulwray down,

1127
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:25,468
she hired you.

1128
01:42:25,578 --> 01:42:28,046
That's how come you found out
he was murdered.

1129
01:42:28,181 --> 01:42:31,173
- I heard it was an accident.
- Come on, Gittes.

1130
01:42:31,317 --> 01:42:34,650
Who the hell do you think you're
dealing with, a bunch of assholes?

1131
01:42:34,754 --> 01:42:37,052
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

1132
01:42:39,159 --> 01:42:42,060
You were following him day and night.
You saw who killed him.

1133
01:42:42,195 --> 01:42:44,186
You even took pictures of it.

1134
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:45,456
It was Evelyn Mulwray,

1135
01:42:45,565 --> 01:42:48,796
and she's been paying you off
like a slot machine ever since.

1136
01:42:48,902 --> 01:42:51,666
- You accusing me of extortion?
- Absolutely.

1137
01:42:51,771 --> 01:42:53,466
I don't think I need a day or two.

1138
01:42:53,573 --> 01:42:55,700
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.

1139
01:42:55,842 --> 01:42:58,834
Not only that, but I wouldn't extort
a nickel from my worst enemy, Escobar.

1140
01:42:58,945 --> 01:43:00,537
That's where I draw the line.

1141
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,807
I want the rest of the pictures, Gittes.

1142
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:04,645
We're talking about accessory
after the fact,

1143
01:43:04,751 --> 01:43:06,412
conspiracy, and extortion, minimum.

1144
01:43:06,553 --> 01:43:08,987
What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray
knocked off her husband in the ocean,

1145
01:43:09,088 --> 01:43:10,385
then dragged him up to a reservoir

1146
01:43:10,523 --> 01:43:13,321
because she thought
it would look more like an accident?

1147
01:43:14,761 --> 01:43:16,058
Mulwray was murdered and moved

1148
01:43:16,196 --> 01:43:19,893
because somebody didn't want his body
found in the ocean.

1149
01:43:20,033 --> 01:43:21,022
Why is that?

1150
01:43:21,134 --> 01:43:23,068
He found out
they were dumping water there.

1151
01:43:23,203 --> 01:43:26,104
That's what they were trying to cover up.

1152
01:43:27,073 --> 01:43:31,009
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on. I'll show you.

1153
01:43:32,245 --> 01:43:35,442
Come on, Lou. You're in charge.
Make a decision.

1154
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,295
- It's too late.
- Too late for what?

1155
01:43:55,435 --> 01:43:57,960
They only dump the water at night.

1156
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:02,708
- Reach anybody?
- Yelburton. He's the new chief.

1157
01:44:02,809 --> 01:44:05,539
- Yeah, I know who he is. Go on!
- He says...

1158
01:44:05,645 --> 01:44:07,977
- I know what he says.
- Shut up.

1159
01:44:09,515 --> 01:44:10,573
Go on!

1160
01:44:10,683 --> 01:44:12,548
Yelburton says there's irrigation
in the Valley,

1161
01:44:12,652 --> 01:44:14,813
and there's always a little run-off
after they do that.

1162
01:44:14,954 --> 01:44:16,444
And he says Gittes knows this,

1163
01:44:16,589 --> 01:44:21,049
and he's been going around making
irresponsible accusations all last week.

1164
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,821
Lou, let's swear out a warrant
for her arrest.

1165
01:44:22,962 --> 01:44:24,759
What the hell are we waiting for?

1166
01:44:24,864 --> 01:44:29,460
He just made lieutenant.
Wants to hang on to his little gold bar.

1167
01:44:33,306 --> 01:44:35,740
Have your client in my office
in two hours.

1168
01:44:35,842 --> 01:44:38,333
And remember,
I don't have to let you go.

1169
01:44:38,478 --> 01:44:41,504
I've got you right now
for withholding evidence.

1170
01:44:42,715 --> 01:44:43,943
Loach?

1171
01:45:29,595 --> 01:45:31,460
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

1172
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:34,791
These her bags?

1173
01:45:37,437 --> 01:45:39,405
Is she going on a trip?

1174
01:45:40,206 --> 01:45:43,073
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

1175
01:45:43,209 --> 01:45:46,576
- ls she going on a vacation?
- Mrs. Mulwray no home.

1176
01:45:47,013 --> 01:45:51,040
"Mrs. Mulwray no home."
Well, I'll just have a look around, huh?

1177
01:45:58,224 --> 01:46:00,158
Yeah, yeah. Bad for the glass.

1178
01:46:00,259 --> 01:46:02,557
Oh, yes. Bad for glass.

1179
01:46:03,096 --> 01:46:05,394
Salt water very bad for glass.

1180
01:46:21,214 --> 01:46:22,545
Salt water?

1181
01:46:23,249 --> 01:46:26,013
Very, very bad. See?

1182
01:46:34,927 --> 01:46:36,360
What's that?

1183
01:46:38,131 --> 01:46:39,564
Right there.

1184
01:46:43,436 --> 01:46:44,596
There.

1185
01:47:42,395 --> 01:47:44,260
- You wait.
- You wait.

1186
01:47:49,869 --> 01:47:52,099
How are you? I've been calling you.

1187
01:47:52,205 --> 01:47:53,638
- Yeah?
- It's all right, Kahn.

1188
01:47:53,739 --> 01:47:55,866
- Have you slept?
- Sure.

1189
01:47:57,043 --> 01:47:59,375
Have you had lunch?
Kahn can fix you something.

1190
01:47:59,512 --> 01:48:02,675
- Where's the girl?
- Upstairs. Why?

1191
01:48:02,815 --> 01:48:04,510
I want to see her.

1192
01:48:04,917 --> 01:48:08,853
She's having a bath right now.
Why do you want to see her?

1193
01:48:08,988 --> 01:48:10,615
Going someplace?

1194
01:48:11,591 --> 01:48:14,321
Yes. We have a 5:30 train to catch.

1195
01:48:18,164 --> 01:48:19,358
Jake?

1196
01:48:28,941 --> 01:48:31,501
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar.

1197
01:48:31,911 --> 01:48:34,641
But... Now look, what's the matter?
What's wrong?

1198
01:48:34,747 --> 01:48:38,843
- I told you, we have a 5:30...
- You're going to miss your train.

1199
01:48:39,352 --> 01:48:40,546
Lieutenant Escobar.

1200
01:48:40,686 --> 01:48:41,744
- Lou?
- Yeah.

1201
01:48:41,888 --> 01:48:44,584
Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.

1202
01:48:46,392 --> 01:48:48,383
Yeah. Soon as you can.

1203
01:48:49,362 --> 01:48:51,193
Why did you do that?

1204
01:48:51,631 --> 01:48:54,498
- You know any good criminal lawyers?
- No.

1205
01:48:56,402 --> 01:48:59,166
Don't worry, I can recommend a couple.

1206
01:48:59,739 --> 01:49:02,674
They're expensive, but you can afford it.

1207
01:49:03,476 --> 01:49:06,673
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

1208
01:49:18,658 --> 01:49:21,627
I found these in your backyard
in the pond.

1209
01:49:22,762 --> 01:49:25,458
They belonged to your husband,
didn't they?

1210
01:49:25,598 --> 01:49:27,065
Didn't they?

1211
01:49:27,967 --> 01:49:31,232
- I don't know. Yes, probably.
- Yes, positively.

1212
01:49:31,337 --> 01:49:33,396
It's where he was drowned.

1213
01:49:33,639 --> 01:49:34,628
What?

1214
01:49:34,774 --> 01:49:37,368
There's no time
to be shocked by the truth.

1215
01:49:37,476 --> 01:49:38,943
The coroner's report proves

1216
01:49:39,078 --> 01:49:41,410
that he had salt water in his lungs
when he was killed.

1217
01:49:41,514 --> 01:49:42,879
Just take my word for it, all right?

1218
01:49:42,982 --> 01:49:45,041
Now, I want to know how it happened,
and I want to know why,

1219
01:49:45,151 --> 01:49:47,142
and I want to know
before Escobar gets here,

1220
01:49:47,286 --> 01:49:49,220
because I don't want to lose my license.

1221
01:49:49,322 --> 01:49:53,383
I don't know what you are talking about.
This is the craziest, most insane thing...

1222
01:49:53,492 --> 01:49:54,959
Stop it!

1223
01:49:55,094 --> 01:49:56,789
I'm gonna make it easy for you.

1224
01:49:56,929 --> 01:49:59,625
You were jealous. You had a fight.
He fell. He hit his head.

1225
01:49:59,765 --> 01:50:00,789
It was an accident!

1226
01:50:00,933 --> 01:50:03,561
But his girl is a witness.
So you had to shut her up.

1227
01:50:03,669 --> 01:50:04,795
You don't have the guts to harm her,

1228
01:50:04,937 --> 01:50:06,768
but you got the money
to keep her mouth shut.

1229
01:50:06,872 --> 01:50:08,464
- Yes or no?
- No!

1230
01:50:09,775 --> 01:50:12,141
Who is she? And don't give me
that crap about your sister,

1231
01:50:12,278 --> 01:50:14,303
because you don't have a sister.

1232
01:50:14,447 --> 01:50:16,074
I'll tell you...

1233
01:50:16,482 --> 01:50:18,507
I'll tell you the truth.

1234
01:50:20,453 --> 01:50:22,284
Good. What's her name?

1235
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:26,920
- Katherine.
- Katherine who?

1236
01:50:29,395 --> 01:50:31,158
She's my daughter.

1237
01:50:32,365 --> 01:50:34,333
I said I want the truth!

1238
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,595
She's my sister.

1239
01:50:38,037 --> 01:50:39,698
She's my daughter.

1240
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,708
My sister, my daughter!

1241
01:50:43,576 --> 01:50:45,339
I said I want the truth!

1242
01:50:45,478 --> 01:50:46,809
All of it!

1243
01:50:49,081 --> 01:50:51,845
She's my sister and my daughter!

1244
01:50:55,821 --> 01:50:57,686
Kahn, please, go back.

1245
01:50:58,257 --> 01:51:00,623
For God's sake, keep her upstairs.
Go back!

1246
01:51:08,267 --> 01:51:09,996
My father and l...

1247
01:51:14,607 --> 01:51:15,972
Understand?

1248
01:51:16,909 --> 01:51:19,002
Or is it too tough for you?

1249
01:51:28,187 --> 01:51:29,654
He raped you?

1250
01:51:46,305 --> 01:51:48,000
Then what happened?

1251
01:51:48,307 --> 01:51:49,706
I ran away.

1252
01:51:50,076 --> 01:51:51,475
T o Mexico.

1253
01:51:58,017 --> 01:52:01,350
Hollis came and took care of me.

1254
01:52:04,457 --> 01:52:06,254
I couldn't see her.

1255
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:08,859
I was 15.

1256
01:52:12,565 --> 01:52:14,499
I wanted to, but l...

1257
01:52:15,801 --> 01:52:17,166
I couldn't.

1258
01:52:19,772 --> 01:52:20,966
Then...

1259
01:52:23,709 --> 01:52:25,836
Now I want to be with her.

1260
01:52:26,645 --> 01:52:28,772
I want to take care of her.

1261
01:52:29,148 --> 01:52:31,309
Where are you going to take her now?

1262
01:52:31,450 --> 01:52:33,008
Back to Mexico.

1263
01:52:34,353 --> 01:52:39,086
Well, you can't take the train. Escobar
will be looking for you everywhere.

1264
01:52:41,494 --> 01:52:46,397
Well, how about a plane?

1265
01:52:46,499 --> 01:52:47,659
No, that's worse.

1266
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:51,133
You better just get out of here.
Leave all this stuff here.

1267
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:55,104
Where does Kahn live?
Get the exact address.

1268
01:52:55,975 --> 01:52:57,306
All right.

1269
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:04,313
Those didn't belong to Hollis.

1270
01:53:04,784 --> 01:53:06,411
How do you know?

1271
01:53:06,786 --> 01:53:08,777
He didn't wear bifocals.

1272
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:44,050
Katherine, say hello to Mr. Gittes.

1273
01:53:44,323 --> 01:53:45,517
Hello.

1274
01:53:46,492 --> 01:53:47,618
Hello.

1275
01:53:52,665 --> 01:53:56,157
He lives at 1712 Alameda.
Do you know where that is?

1276
01:53:59,238 --> 01:54:00,364
Sure.

1277
01:54:21,427 --> 01:54:23,224
J. J. Gittes and Associates.

1278
01:54:23,362 --> 01:54:26,160
- Sophie, get me Walsh.
- Yes, Mr. Gittes.

1279
01:54:27,266 --> 01:54:28,824
- Jake?
- Yeah.

1280
01:54:28,934 --> 01:54:32,529
Listen, pal, Escobar's going to try
and book me in about five minutes.

1281
01:54:32,638 --> 01:54:34,162
What? What the hell's the matter?
What...

1282
01:54:34,273 --> 01:54:36,241
Relax and I'll tell you.

1283
01:54:36,375 --> 01:54:38,502
Wait in the office for me
about two hours.

1284
01:54:38,611 --> 01:54:43,139
If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy
meet me at 1712 Alameda.

1285
01:54:44,016 --> 01:54:46,883
Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it?

1286
01:54:47,019 --> 01:54:48,919
I know where it is. Just do it.

1287
01:54:49,054 --> 01:54:51,079
1712 Alameda...

1288
01:55:19,885 --> 01:55:21,512
Come on in, Lou.

1289
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:26,655
Looks like we're both too late.
She flew the coop.

1290
01:55:31,997 --> 01:55:35,296
I don't suppose you have any idea
where she went.

1291
01:55:35,401 --> 01:55:38,165
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Where?

1292
01:55:38,304 --> 01:55:41,137
Her maid's house.
I think she knows something's up.

1293
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:43,367
What's the maid's address?

1294
01:55:43,876 --> 01:55:45,776
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down.

1295
01:55:45,878 --> 01:55:48,847
No, no, no, Gittes.
You're going to show us.

1296
01:55:49,648 --> 01:55:50,945
What for?

1297
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:53,843
Because if she ain't there,
you're going downtown,

1298
01:55:53,986 --> 01:55:57,149
and you're gonna stay there
until she does show up.

1299
01:55:57,823 --> 01:56:00,417
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

1300
01:56:01,827 --> 01:56:04,694
Tell us about it
on the way to San Pedro.

1301
01:56:17,943 --> 01:56:21,674
- Let's get the little lady.
- Lou, can I ask you a favor?

1302
01:56:22,214 --> 01:56:24,944
I'd like to bring her out myself.

1303
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:28,577
She's not armed or nothing.
She won't be a problem.

1304
01:56:28,687 --> 01:56:32,589
I just want a minute alone with her.
It would mean a lot to her.

1305
01:56:32,691 --> 01:56:34,022
And to me.

1306
01:56:38,697 --> 01:56:41,063
You never learn, do you, Jake?

1307
01:56:42,768 --> 01:56:44,235
I guess not.

1308
01:56:47,172 --> 01:56:48,730
Okay. But...

1309
01:56:50,676 --> 01:56:52,735
I'll give you three minutes.

1310
01:56:52,845 --> 01:56:54,335
Just three minutes.

1311
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,175
Gee, thanks, Lou.

1312
01:57:12,297 --> 01:57:13,457
Yes?

1313
01:57:14,667 --> 01:57:15,793
Hello.

1314
01:57:16,802 --> 01:57:20,238
Mr. Gittes! Come in!
Well, this is some surprise, Mr. Gittes.

1315
01:57:20,339 --> 01:57:22,170
Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly?

1316
01:57:22,307 --> 01:57:24,275
Just sitting down for supper.
You care to join us?

1317
01:57:24,376 --> 01:57:25,570
No, thanks.

1318
01:57:25,678 --> 01:57:27,441
How about a glass of wine?

1319
01:57:27,546 --> 01:57:30,174
- Hey, honey, this is the fellow that...
- I know.

1320
01:57:30,315 --> 01:57:33,614
No, thank you, Curly, very much,
but I would like a glass of water, though.

1321
01:57:33,752 --> 01:57:35,652
Come on out in the kitchen with me
for a second, huh?

1322
01:57:35,788 --> 01:57:37,119
Sure thing.

1323
01:57:41,193 --> 01:57:43,093
- Curly, where's your car?
- ln the garage.

1324
01:57:43,195 --> 01:57:45,390
- Where's that?
- Off the alley.

1325
01:57:45,497 --> 01:57:48,091
- Can you give me a ride somewhere?
- Sure, soon as we eat.

1326
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:50,566
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.

1327
01:57:51,003 --> 01:57:53,904
- I'll tell my wife.
- T ell her later, Curl, huh?

1328
01:58:25,971 --> 01:58:28,963
Just drive slow for a block or two,
will you, Curly?

1329
01:58:29,108 --> 01:58:33,477
- What's this all about?
- I'll tell you in a block or two.

1330
01:58:34,813 --> 01:58:36,542
How much do you owe me?

1331
01:58:36,648 --> 01:58:39,617
Gee, Mr. Gittes,
we're going out tomorrow.

1332
01:58:39,752 --> 01:58:43,449
I know you been real good about it,
but my cousin Auggie's sick.

1333
01:58:43,589 --> 01:58:45,420
Forget it.
How would you like to pay me off

1334
01:58:45,524 --> 01:58:48,652
by taking a couple of passengers
to Ensenada?

1335
01:58:48,794 --> 01:58:52,252
- You'd have to leave tonight.
- I don't know.

1336
01:58:52,364 --> 01:58:56,664
I might be able to squeeze 75 bucks
out of it for you.

1337
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,060
Maybe even 100.

1338
01:59:00,572 --> 01:59:03,473
- Plus what I owe?
- I'll throw that in, too.

1339
01:59:04,676 --> 01:59:08,237
1712 Alameda. It's in Chinatown.
Wait for me until 8:30.

1340
01:59:08,347 --> 01:59:11,316
If I don't show up,
take them to your boat.

1341
01:59:24,429 --> 01:59:26,329
You sure this is okay?

1342
01:59:27,166 --> 01:59:30,602
Curly, you know how long
I've been in this business?

1343
01:59:57,963 --> 02:00:02,059
Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

1344
02:00:03,168 --> 02:00:05,363
You've got her? Where?

1345
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:07,563
Do you remember
the figures we discussed?

1346
02:00:07,673 --> 02:00:09,800
Of course I do. Where are you?

1347
02:00:09,942 --> 02:00:13,275
At your daughter's house.
How soon can you get here?

1348
02:00:13,412 --> 02:00:14,640
An hour.

1349
02:00:38,570 --> 02:00:40,435
Oh, there you are.

1350
02:00:40,572 --> 02:00:44,941
Well, you don't look too much the worse
for wear, Mr. Gitts, I must say.

1351
02:00:45,777 --> 02:00:47,768
- Where's the girl?
- I've got her.

1352
02:00:47,913 --> 02:00:50,143
- ls she all right?
- She's fine.

1353
02:00:50,816 --> 02:00:52,579
Well, where is she?

1354
02:00:53,151 --> 02:00:54,846
With her mother.

1355
02:00:56,622 --> 02:00:59,750
I got something
I'd like to show you, Mr. Cross.

1356
02:00:59,892 --> 02:01:01,018
What is it?

1357
02:01:01,126 --> 02:01:04,755
An obituary column.
Can you see all right in this light?

1358
02:01:05,097 --> 02:01:06,587
I guess I can manage.

1359
02:01:16,408 --> 02:01:17,966
What does it mean?

1360
02:01:18,110 --> 02:01:20,442
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

1361
02:01:21,446 --> 02:01:22,845
Right here,

1362
02:01:23,148 --> 02:01:24,672
in that pond.

1363
02:01:25,384 --> 02:01:27,011
You drowned him.

1364
02:01:28,287 --> 02:01:30,050
And you left these.

1365
02:01:32,291 --> 02:01:36,387
The coroner's report shows Mulwray
had salt water in his lungs.

1366
02:01:39,965 --> 02:01:44,129
Hollis was always fascinated
by tide pools.

1367
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:47,195
You know what he used to say?

1368
02:01:47,306 --> 02:01:48,864
I haven't the faintest idea.

1369
02:01:48,974 --> 02:01:51,033
"That's where life begins."

1370
02:01:51,143 --> 02:01:53,008
Sloughs, tide pools.

1371
02:01:54,646 --> 02:01:55,704
When we first come out here,

1372
02:01:55,814 --> 02:01:58,578
he figured if you dumped water
into desert sand

1373
02:01:58,684 --> 02:02:02,620
and let it percolate down to the bedrock,
it would stay there

1374
02:02:02,754 --> 02:02:05,780
instead of evaporate
the way it does in most reservoirs.

1375
02:02:05,924 --> 02:02:09,553
You'd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80.
He made this city.

1376
02:02:09,661 --> 02:02:11,458
And that's what you were going to do
in the Valley.

1377
02:02:11,596 --> 02:02:12,927
It's what I am doing.

1378
02:02:13,298 --> 02:02:14,925
When the bond issue passes Tuesday,

1379
02:02:15,067 --> 02:02:17,297
there'll be $8 million
to build an aqueduct and a reservoir.

1380
02:02:17,436 --> 02:02:18,869
I'm doing it.

1381
02:02:18,971 --> 02:02:20,529
Gonna be a lot of irate citizens

1382
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:23,904
when they find out that they're paying
for water that they're not gonna get.

1383
02:02:24,009 --> 02:02:25,977
Oh, that's all taken care of.

1384
02:02:26,111 --> 02:02:30,138
See, Mr. Gitts,
either you bring the water to L. A.,

1385
02:02:30,282 --> 02:02:32,580
or you bring L. A. to the water.

1386
02:02:33,251 --> 02:02:34,309
How are you gonna do that?

1387
02:02:34,453 --> 02:02:38,253
By incorporating the Valley into the city.
Simple as that.

1388
02:02:39,992 --> 02:02:42,153
- How much are you worth?
- I have no idea.

1389
02:02:42,294 --> 02:02:43,386
How much do you want?

1390
02:02:43,495 --> 02:02:45,963
No, I just want to know
what you're worth. Over $10 million?

1391
02:02:46,098 --> 02:02:49,090
- Oh my, yes.
- Why are you doing it?

1392
02:02:49,201 --> 02:02:50,293
How much better can you eat?

1393
02:02:50,435 --> 02:02:52,630
What can you buy
that you can't already afford?

1394
02:02:52,771 --> 02:02:54,602
The future, Mr. Gitts!

1395
02:02:55,107 --> 02:02:56,472
The future!

1396
02:02:57,309 --> 02:02:59,140
Now, where's the girl?

1397
02:02:59,277 --> 02:03:01,575
I want the only daughter I've got left.

1398
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:04,843
As you found out,
Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

1399
02:03:04,983 --> 02:03:07,315
Who do you blame for that? Her?

1400
02:03:07,886 --> 02:03:09,683
I don't blame myself.

1401
02:03:11,023 --> 02:03:14,288
See, Mr. Gitts, most people
never have to face the fact

1402
02:03:14,393 --> 02:03:16,953
that at the right time and the right place,

1403
02:03:17,062 --> 02:03:19,257
they're capable of anything.

1404
02:03:21,466 --> 02:03:24,697
Claude, take those glasses from him,
will you?

1405
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:34,174
It's not worth it, Mr. Gitts.

1406
02:03:36,181 --> 02:03:38,206
It's really not worth it.

1407
02:03:44,856 --> 02:03:45,823
Where's the girl?

1408
02:04:41,012 --> 02:04:44,106
You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill, don't you, boys?

1409
02:04:44,249 --> 02:04:47,741
Mr. Cross, these are my associates,
Mr. Walsh and Mr...

1410
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:51,147
You're under arrest, Jake.

1411
02:04:53,291 --> 02:04:54,383
Good news.

1412
02:04:54,493 --> 02:04:58,122
Withholding evidence, extortion,
accessory after the fact.

1413
02:04:58,263 --> 02:05:00,561
I didn't extort nothing from nobody, Lou.

1414
02:05:00,665 --> 02:05:03,964
This is Noah Cross, if you don't know.
Evelyn's father, if you don't know.

1415
02:05:04,102 --> 02:05:06,263
He's the bird you're after, Lou.
I can explain everything.

1416
02:05:06,371 --> 02:05:07,429
- Lieutenant?
- Just give me five minutes.

1417
02:05:07,539 --> 02:05:08,597
That's all I need.

1418
02:05:08,707 --> 02:05:10,834
- He's rich! Do you understand?
- Shut up!

1419
02:05:10,976 --> 02:05:13,103
He thinks he can get away
with anything!

1420
02:05:13,211 --> 02:05:15,441
Shut up or I'm gonna lock you in
to the wheel of that car.

1421
02:05:15,547 --> 02:05:19,278
Lieutenant, I am rich, I am Noah Cross.

1422
02:05:19,985 --> 02:05:22,419
- Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.
- He's crazy, Lou!

1423
02:05:22,521 --> 02:05:24,182
He killed Mulwray because
of the water thing!

1424
02:05:24,322 --> 02:05:25,311
- I'm telling...
- Water?

1425
02:05:25,457 --> 02:05:26,515
Would you just listen to me
for five minutes?

1426
02:05:26,658 --> 02:05:29,422
Loach, lock him to the wheel of that car.

1427
02:05:30,395 --> 02:05:33,262
Lou, you don't know
what's going on here. I'm telling you.

1428
02:05:33,365 --> 02:05:34,764
Katherine!

1429
02:05:34,966 --> 02:05:36,126
Katherine.

1430
02:05:36,234 --> 02:05:41,103
- I am your grandfather, my dear.
- Come, miss.

1431
02:05:41,206 --> 02:05:42,833
- I'm your grandfather.
- Come, miss.

1432
02:05:42,974 --> 02:05:44,635
Katherine, get in the car.

1433
02:05:44,743 --> 02:05:46,108
- Go on, go on.
- But, ma'am...

1434
02:05:46,211 --> 02:05:49,339
No, no, go back to the Hong Kong.
I'll follow. It's all right.

1435
02:05:50,215 --> 02:05:52,206
Get away from her. Get away!

1436
02:05:52,350 --> 02:05:57,151
Evelyn. Please, please, be reasonable.

1437
02:05:57,255 --> 02:05:59,655
- Come to my...
- Get away from her!

1438
02:05:59,758 --> 02:06:01,020
Evelyn!

1439
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:05,127
How many years have I got?

1440
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:07,288
She's mine, too.

1441
02:06:07,399 --> 02:06:09,799
She's never going to know that!

1442
02:06:12,003 --> 02:06:16,201
Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman.
You cannot hope to provide.

1443
02:06:16,341 --> 02:06:19,071
Evelyn, put that gun away!
Let the police handle this!

1444
02:06:19,211 --> 02:06:21,008
He owns the police!

1445
02:06:21,846 --> 02:06:23,370
Get away from her.

1446
02:06:23,515 --> 02:06:26,678
- You'll have to kill me first.
- Get away! Get...

1447
02:06:27,886 --> 02:06:29,979
Katherine, close the door.

1448
02:06:30,855 --> 02:06:31,981
Halt!

1449
02:07:12,497 --> 02:07:13,930
Oh, no!

1450
02:07:14,032 --> 02:07:16,728
Better call the captain.
Get an ambulance.

1451
02:07:16,835 --> 02:07:18,803
- No!
- Turn him loose. Turn them all loose.

1452
02:07:18,937 --> 02:07:20,461
- Lord.
- No!

1453
02:07:24,109 --> 02:07:25,337
Lord.

1454
02:07:25,810 --> 02:07:27,141
Lord.

1455
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:30,247
No! No!

1456
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:35,781
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.

1457
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:51,028
- As little as possible.
- What's that?

1458
02:07:54,339 --> 02:07:55,806
What's that?

1459
02:08:00,345 --> 02:08:03,212
You want to do your partner
a big favor?

1460
02:08:04,883 --> 02:08:06,373
T ake him home.

1461
02:08:10,021 --> 02:08:11,545
T ake him home!

1462
02:08:11,856 --> 02:08:14,347
Just get him the hell out of here!

1463
02:08:14,492 --> 02:08:15,982
Come on, Jake.

1464
02:08:17,062 --> 02:08:18,552
Go home, Jake.

1465
02:08:19,597 --> 02:08:21,622
I'm doing you a favor.

1466
02:08:23,201 --> 02:08:24,725
Come on, Jake.

1467
02:08:27,872 --> 02:08:30,238
Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.

1468
02:08:45,123 --> 02:08:48,957
All right, come on. Clear the area!
On the sidewalk!

1469
02:08:50,995 --> 02:08:52,690
On the sidewalk!

1470
02:08:54,833 --> 02:08:56,562
Get off the street!

1471
02:08:58,937 --> 02:09:00,700
Get off the street!
