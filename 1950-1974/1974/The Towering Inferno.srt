1
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,516
- So how was it?
- Good.

2
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,894
- You're gonna go ahead?
- Full steam.

3
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,564
Anything I can do to change your mind?

4
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:31,649
Nope. No way.

5
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,278
You know, there's an old saying:

6
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:40,241
"No matter how hot it gets up there
during the day...

7
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:43,703
...there's not a..."
- "Not a damn thing to do at night."

8
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:47,790
What the hell are you gonna do
at night in the middle of nowhere?

9
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:50,084
Sleep like a winner.

10
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:57,092
Doug, you're a city boy with
a low threshold of boredom.

11
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,261
You'll be back in two weeks.

12
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:05,893
Come in the office for a minute.

13
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:08,770
I got people waiting upstairs.

14
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:13,734
I wanted to tell you...

15
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:17,321
...Senator Parker's coming
to the dedication tonight.

16
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,782
He's almost guaranteed
the urban renewal contract.

17
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,951
Do you know what that means?

18
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,079
Skyscrapers like this
all over the country.

19
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,790
You design them. I'll build them.

20
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,960
Jim, I think you suffer from
an edifice complex.

21
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,837
You'll never leave.

22
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:38,175
After the party, come on downstairs
and watch me burn my black tie.

23
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,856
Glad to see you back.

24
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:55,317
Doug, I can't understand it.

25
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:57,402
The dampers won't stay opened.

26
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:00,739
- Whatever happened to "hello"?
- Hello.

27
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,449
- How are you?
- Good.

28
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,034
You look like it took.

29
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:06,578
- Hi, Mr. Roberts.
- Just a second.

30
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:07,872
We'll miss you.

31
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,542
- Duncan know?
- He's all smiles.

32
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,336
- What electromagnets went in?
- Doug?

33
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:17,173
- Thompson G-4s.
- Don't you think they should be G-12s?

34
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:21,553
That's what comes from
last-minute panic. I'll fix it.

35
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:23,972
There's ground water
on that Atlanta job.

36
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:25,849
Bring the designs in today.

37
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,851
How about Chicago specs?

38
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:30,270
- Philadelphia?
- In a minute, guys.

39
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,273
Well, hello.

40
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:34,732
Welcome back.

41
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:38,236
Are you taking any calls?

42
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:39,737
Who's there?

43
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:44,909
No, I'm not taking any calls.

44
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:18,110
Are we gonna talk at all?

45
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,779
No. It's my lunch hour.

46
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,701
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger,
you know.

47
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:29,330
You're better.
All protein, no bread.

48
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,708
All I need to go with you
is about eight glasses of water.

49
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,836
All I need to go with you
is in that suitcase.

50
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:39,965
I got about a $ 140 worth of
vulgar underwear for you.

51
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,093
First things first.

52
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,521
That's nice.

53
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,610
Years from now, when they talk
about this, and they will...

54
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,280
...remember to tell them that
it was my idea.

55
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:17,127
Got change for a 50?

56
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:20,005
Sorry, it's the smallest I have.

57
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:22,091
Not a chance!

58
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:24,218
Let's see what we got here...

59
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:33,061
Twenty-five, 50, 60...

60
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:37,983
...70, 75...

61
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,611
...85, 95.

62
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:45,157
That's it exactly.
Catch your tip next time.

63
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,539
All your security squad's up there...

64
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:46,969
Hello, Mrs. Allbright.

65
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,429
Hi, Phillip.

66
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,099
We won't be so messy tomorrow.
We're gonna try charcoals.

67
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:58,272
Mommy wants to know if
you'll have dinner with us?

68
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:01,609
Thank you, but I'm going up
to the tower party.

69
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:03,110
Aren't you coming?

70
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,287
Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't
go to parties since Daddy died.

71
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:17,834
Here, let me take that paint off.

72
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,587
Bye.
How are you, Phillip?

73
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:25,174
- Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that?
- I said how are you?

74
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:26,634
Okay.

75
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,678
Goodbye.

76
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,597
Okay, I'll get on it right now.

77
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:38,938
I'll have to check the panel.
Have to see if all those light up.

78
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:40,148
Mr. Callahan?

79
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,233
We still got any G-12 electrodes?

80
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:44,527
- Yeah, main storeroom.
- Right.

81
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:47,864
Okay, booster pump, zone one.

82
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:49,949
- One-ten.
- Check.

83
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,452
Main generator, zone one.

84
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,538
I don't get any reading.

85
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:57,457
Try the auxiliary generator.

86
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:02,504
What the hell?

87
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:05,591
Go ahead.

88
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:19,188
Here we are.

89
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,982
Are there offices on this floor,
as well as apartments?

90
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:23,984
I wouldn't like that at all!

91
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,445
The business offices only go up to 80.

92
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,322
From the 81 st floor, here...

93
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,658
...all the way up to 120,
it's exclusively residential.

94
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:35,829
Now, the apartment
I want to show you is 8145...

95
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:06,861
Say, Bill?
Tune in the main utility room.

96
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,845
Something's screwed up.

97
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:34,430
The sensor didn't trip
the fire alarm.

98
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,809
Why should it?
You can see for yourself.

99
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:39,561
There's no fire.

100
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:43,231
The sensor indicates there is.
Plus Wes just called.

101
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,568
He said they're having
wiring problems down there.

102
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:48,611
You better stay with it.

103
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:55,702
I want you up there with me.
We can do good things together.

104
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:58,830
What's the matter?

105
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,962
Hello?

106
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:11,801
Dave's leaving.
They've offered me managing editor.

107
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:15,097
That's nice.

108
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:21,729
I mean... I guess we've got ourselves
a situation.

109
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:25,316
It seems.

110
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:30,446
I want the kind of life
you're talking about. I want that.

111
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:34,909
I want a place where our kids can
run around and grow and be free.

112
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:36,160
But?

113
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,373
I want this job.

114
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:43,083
I wanted it for five years.

115
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,795
I've worked for it for five years.
Now suddenly it's there.

116
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:51,884
See, I have ideas, Doug.

117
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:57,264
I can do something with it
that hasn't been done before.

118
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:03,729
I guess I want both, and I
can't have both. Can I?

119
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,608
I don't know.

120
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:16,909
Where?

121
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:19,954
Be right there.

122
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:23,708
Let's hold this off till tonight.

123
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,382
What happened?

124
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:33,718
We kicked on the auxiliary,
and this shorted out.

125
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:36,221
Power off?

126
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:47,274
- What about that?
- It should've been conduit.

127
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:49,776
Give me a pair of dikes.

128
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:14,509
I know, I know.
Callahan called me.

129
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,303
Now just how bad is it?

130
00:16:16,553 --> 00:16:18,972
Depends on how good
your imagination is.

131
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:20,640
Jesus Christ!

132
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:23,768
Specs called for
conduit safety covering.

133
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:29,107
How many fuse terminals
did you check?

134
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:30,650
How many do I have to?

135
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,448
<i>Mr. Bigelow is here, sir.</i>

136
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,325
Okay, send him in.

137
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:40,703
Now, Doug, one piece of
scorched wire...

138
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:44,040
...from a burned-out circuit breaker
isn't conclusive.

139
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,003
Maybe not. But now I'm worried about
what other shocks we're in for.

140
00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:52,548
Will, Doug...

141
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,511
...J.D., wait till you see this.

142
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:04,894
What happened?
Was the wallpaper hung wrong?

143
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:08,189
We have an equipment problem.

144
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:12,777
- No problem in the tower, is there?
- Could be.

145
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:14,570
Come on.
You're just guessing.

146
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:17,073
I want to talk
to your son-in-law.

147
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:19,659
I wanna talk to him right away.

148
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:23,663
<i>- Get Roger Simmons.
- Yes, sir.</i>

149
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:25,748
I guarantee I'll check this out.

150
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:27,750
We're all going
to check it out.

151
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:31,754
I'm missing something.

152
00:17:33,256 --> 00:17:34,799
We damn near had a fire.

153
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:39,595
Yeah, a fire.

154
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:45,561
In this building? Come on.

155
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:48,564
We haven't finished installing
the safety equipment.

156
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:51,984
- The party should've been put off...
- Hold it, Will!

157
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,486
Everybody's overreacting.

158
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:57,781
<i>- Mr. Simmons is out, sir.
- Out where?</i>

159
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,577
<i>They don 't know, sir,
but I left word for him to call.</i>

160
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:09,084
We'll talk to Roger tomorrow.
And then we'll decide what to do.

161
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:12,212
- That's okay, isn't it?
- Nope. Won't wait.

162
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:27,769
Try zone one again.

163
00:18:29,563 --> 00:18:31,398
Damn it!
This is top priority.

164
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,942
We gotta get these
electrical systems on.

165
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:37,237
Our security program's
loused up without them.

166
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,470
Don't go away.

167
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,949
Doug!
Well, what a surprise!

168
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,704
Where's that electrical
genius of yours?

169
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:30,333
I called his office, the club,
the marina. No luck.

170
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,293
What's he done?

171
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:37,090
Come on, I'll get you a drink.

172
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:42,095
He must've done something.
My father called.

173
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:44,389
He hasn't been that upset in years.

174
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:46,683
Have any idea where he is?

175
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,688
Well my husband's territory
ranges rather widely.

176
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:56,776
It's like that of the timber wolf,
anywhere within a 50-mile radius.

177
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:59,404
But if you wanna wait,
he'll show up.

178
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:01,698
He has to.
His clothes are here.

179
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:06,452
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks.

180
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:11,500
I guess you don't plan to tell me
what Roger's done.

181
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:20,050
Hi, Doug.

182
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,428
- Honey.
- Hello.

183
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:26,515
- What are you drinking these days?
- Nothing, right now.

184
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:29,894
Well, welcome back from
the wilderness.

185
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,563
To what do we owe the pleasure?

186
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,065
Callahan was
testing a backup generator.

187
00:20:35,316 --> 00:20:37,401
There was a systems failure.

188
00:20:38,694 --> 00:20:40,279
How can that be?

189
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,031
It can't be, theoretically.

190
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:47,411
Unless you screwed around
with the electrical specifications.

191
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:50,998
That's being rather blunt,
isn't it?

192
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,750
You betcha.

193
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,920
Then you'll understand my being
equally blunt.

194
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,172
What the hell business is it of yours?

195
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:01,342
I wonder what kickbacks were involved.

196
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:05,221
I don't have to take crap from you.

197
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:11,560
Listen. We had an electrical
flare-up in the main utility room.

198
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,772
Some of that wiring
wasn't exactly what I asked for.

199
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:19,069
All the wire I put in is up to code,
inspected and approved.

200
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,739
Code's not enough for that building!
And you know it!

201
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:25,742
I asked for installations
way above standard.

202
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:29,871
Buddy, you live in a dream world.
I deal in realities.

203
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,669
I want your wiring diagrams
and copies of your work orders.

204
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,381
That would take weeks
and a lot more clout than you have!

205
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,634
In my office! Tomorrow, 9:00.

206
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,682
They say he used to wrestle
grizzly bears in Montana.

207
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,686
Of course, he was younger then.
Probably in better condition.

208
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:58,859
You must have enjoyed
all this immensely.

209
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,194
No, I didn't.

210
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,364
Actually, I'm depressed
for both of us.

211
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,659
What did you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?

212
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,998
If you've done anything to
Dad's building, God help you.

213
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,669
Baby, I don't need God's help
or your old man's. Not anymore.

214
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,214
So don't expect me to shake
every time Daddy barks...

215
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,177
...even if that's
what you want me to do.

216
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,140
All I want is the man
I thought I married.

217
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:37,106
I guess we're running out of
reasons to stay married, aren't we?

218
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,444
It's getting late.

219
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,363
Mustn't miss the party.

220
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:28,260
Stand back, please!
Everybody, back of the ropes!

221
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,972
Stand back, please.
Everybody, back of the ropes!

222
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,234
Hi.

223
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:50,073
7:30 sharp.
I hope you like your men prompt.

224
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:51,618
At my age?

225
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:54,329
I only care that they show up at all.

226
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:56,164
Nonsense.

227
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,210
Be a good girl, Elke.

228
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,922
I left you some milk in the kitchen.
See you later.

229
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:09,928
Did you find Simmons?

230
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:11,638
Yeah, I found him.

231
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:14,140
Did he or didn't he change your specs?

232
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,851
He didn't admit it,
but I bet you he did.

233
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,605
Payoffs and kickbacks.
The only way he could've swung it.

234
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:25,568
Here you are...

235
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:27,904
...your original specs.

236
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:30,990
Zone one only, but
we gotta start somewhere.

237
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,663
That son of a bitch
gave us an impossible job.

238
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:45,296
- Susan.
- Hello, Dan.

239
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:46,631
Good evening.

240
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:50,176
- How are you, dear?
- Congratulations. It's magnificent.

241
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:51,845
Thank you.

242
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:53,972
I'll meet you out front.

243
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:57,058
- I'd like to talk to Susan.
- Right.

244
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:03,148
Find me the architect
who designed you...

245
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:05,526
...and who needs Doug Roberts?

246
00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:07,069
I do.

247
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:10,823
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a gala evening.

248
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,534
The entire city
is in a holiday mood.

249
00:26:13,784 --> 00:26:16,704
The list of luminaries reads
like a Who's Who.

250
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:19,790
There are leaders
from society and government...

251
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:22,543
...stars of screen and television.

252
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:26,463
And now, just arriving,
the Honorable Gary Parker...

253
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:30,009
...chairman of the
Federal Urban Renewal Commission.

254
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:33,804
The senator's in from Washington
to be here for the dedication.

255
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:36,473
Senator Parker,
ladies and gentlemen.

256
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:40,853
We'll try to get him to the microphone
to say a few words for you.

257
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:48,068
Thank you. Thank you.

258
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,820
Thank you very much.

259
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:53,157
I'm honored to be here tonight.

260
00:26:53,449 --> 00:26:57,578
This magnificent building
represents yet another landmark...

261
00:26:57,828 --> 00:27:00,748
...in a long succession of landmarks
for this great city.

262
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:03,584
I think you've
got him in the bag, Jim.

263
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:06,545
- Being here at
this historic moment.

264
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:08,172
Thank you.

265
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:17,766
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. And Mrs. Roger Simmons.

266
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:21,728
Mrs. Simmons is the daughter
of the builder, Jim Duncan.

267
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:29,653
How are you?

268
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:32,280
Nice to see you, senator.

269
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:35,075
Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please.

270
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:37,494
Where were you all day?

271
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:41,122
I wasn't aware
the leash was that tight.

272
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:44,084
Later, I wanna
ask you a few questions...

273
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,170
...and I expect
some straight answers.

274
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:53,218
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay.

275
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:20,537
I thank you very much.

276
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:29,005
I hereby dedicate
this magnificent glass tower...

277
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:32,216
...tallest building in the world!

278
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:41,893
We'll make it. That's it.

279
00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:48,900
All right, Callahan?

280
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:51,194
Hit them.

281
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:22,892
This way.

282
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:26,312
It's really something, isn't it?

283
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:31,025
After you.

284
00:29:38,116 --> 00:29:39,159
Come on, Dan.

285
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:42,496
I'm going by the office.
I'll be up in a few minutes.

286
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:01,265
I've never seen
the bridge look like that.

287
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:04,142
- It's unbelievable!
- Astonishing!

288
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:23,412
- How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow?
- Fine, thank you. Good night.

289
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:25,789
Shall I leave you a night line?

290
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,626
No, you can disconnect.
I've had it with phones for today.

291
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:33,589
Lorrie...

292
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:36,508
Sorry, but I have
a letter that must go out.

293
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:38,385
See you Monday, Janet.

294
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:45,518
Gee, I never thought he'd
come back here before the party.

295
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:47,604
We almost missed him.

296
00:30:47,854 --> 00:30:50,899
It's all right.
I'm not gonna do anything tonight.

297
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:53,193
Have a nice weekend.

298
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:54,444
Thanks. You too.

299
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:22,430
Hello.

300
00:31:23,723 --> 00:31:24,891
Hi.

301
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,770
- Promise me something?
- What?

302
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,358
If I ever start taking you for granted,
do something about it.

303
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:35,735
And what do you suggest?

304
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,863
Cut off the phone lines.

305
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:41,574
Pour coffee down my neck.

306
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,077
Tweak my nose?

307
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,622
I promise.

308
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,820
- How's the family?
- Fine, thank you.

309
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,655
Good. Gary?

310
00:33:02,656 --> 00:33:05,201
- Would you excuse us, gentlemen?
- Certainly.

311
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:09,623
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Politicians don't like surprises.

312
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:12,501
- Carlos?
- Yes, sir.

313
00:33:12,876 --> 00:33:15,629
- What can I fix you?
- Meet Senator Parker.

314
00:33:15,837 --> 00:33:18,131
- Great pleasure.
- It's an honor, senator.

315
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:21,176
Show him what you've been
hiding back there.

316
00:33:21,426 --> 00:33:22,719
Yes, sir.

317
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:29,392
1929?

318
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:32,771
- That's all you'll drink tonight.
- A whole case?

319
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:35,690
What you don't drink,
we'll ship to Washington.

320
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:38,527
- Open a bottle, will you?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:44,199
How did you ever come by a whole case?

322
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:46,076
Come on, Jim.

323
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:48,370
It's nothing.

324
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:57,128
I guess you're looking for someone.

325
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:58,839
I am. Have you seen him?

326
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:01,550
I've ordered for Patty.
What can I get you?

327
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,304
- Nothing right now. Thank you, Roger.
- Susan, tell me...

328
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:09,891
What does a girl do in San Francisco
when her old man...

329
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:12,143
...decides to leave for two years?

330
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:16,231
Beats me, buddy.

331
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:18,442
No headhunting?

332
00:34:18,693 --> 00:34:21,112
I've had a little trouble
making that work.

333
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:23,990
Could we discuss that
tomorrow at lunch?

334
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,575
No.

335
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:38,129
- You must miss your villa.
- Well, yes and no.

336
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:41,132
It gets rather dull
in the south of France.

337
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:46,387
Nothing but swimming and yachting,
partying and all that sort of thing.

338
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:51,267
And believe it or not, they fight
over the few eligible bachelors.

339
00:34:51,517 --> 00:34:53,853
Even such old scraps as I.

340
00:34:54,061 --> 00:34:57,398
- No false humility, please.
- Oh, shall we?

341
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,905
I decided to come back to
the reality of San Francisco...

342
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:07,325
...to regain my perspective
and my humility...

343
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:11,078
...and spend more time at the one
thing I'm really good at:

344
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:13,039
The stock market.

345
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:17,627
Monte Carlo's losses,
San Francisco's gains.

346
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:18,878
Thank you.

347
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:22,965
Do you believe in destiny?

348
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:27,637
I believe in all good things.

349
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:34,520
There must be a reason
for my coming back home.

350
00:35:34,978 --> 00:35:36,188
Meeting you.

351
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:58,710
This can't be right.

352
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,176
It's too hot.

353
00:36:06,718 --> 00:36:08,720
You better leave it off.

354
00:36:18,897 --> 00:36:20,232
Utility. Wes.

355
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,276
Doug,
I'm up on 83 with Will.

356
00:36:22,526 --> 00:36:25,612
We got a wiring problem.
Overloads could be trouble.

357
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:28,782
Shut down as many of
the zone one systems as you can.

358
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:30,200
I can't do that.

359
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,995
All the lights are on
for the dedication ceremony.

360
00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:36,582
You mean the whole building?

361
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:39,377
We're taking
the overload just fine.

362
00:36:40,503 --> 00:36:42,463
Well, shut it down right away.

363
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:46,009
I can't do that without an okay
from Mr. Duncan himself.

364
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:49,470
I'll accept the responsibility.
Just turn off the lights!

365
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,223
What about the lights
in the tower for the party?

366
00:36:52,432 --> 00:36:56,060
- Not all the power, just the overload!
- Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts!

367
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,690
We better get down to 81
and check the relay systems.

368
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,568
They turned on everything
in the whole building.

369
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,279
There's something on 81.

370
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:24,255
Phone it in, in case the lines
to the fire department are out.

371
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:26,299
- I'll be in 81.
- You got it.

372
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:49,717
Get those drapes!

373
00:38:55,431 --> 00:38:57,141
Smother it!
Try to smother it!

374
00:38:57,391 --> 00:39:01,021
Pull it around over here.
Put it all over him. Come on!

375
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:03,481
Let's get some water onto that fire.

376
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:07,027
Turn it on!

377
00:39:31,927 --> 00:39:34,554
Down, down! Stay low!

378
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:41,436
Call an ambulance for this man.

379
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:44,898
Get on the ball!
Call an ambulance!

380
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:47,817
I want everybody off this floor!

381
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:50,195
- The fire department?
- On their way.

382
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:53,824
Get that ambulance. Give me a hand.
Get him in the elevator.

383
00:39:54,074 --> 00:39:57,911
All right, try not to touch him.
Try to get him by his belt.

384
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,290
This is 81. A man's been burned.
Get an ambulance.

385
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,667
Yes, right away.

386
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:07,504
Call Duncan in the tower.
He's got a lot of people up there.

387
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:09,631
- What?
- Do it now!

388
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:27,942
It's Mr. Roberts.

389
00:40:28,317 --> 00:40:30,903
Yeah, Doug. We were
getting worried about you.

390
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:34,407
Susan's here, Senator Parker,
the mayor and his wife.

391
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:37,702
They're asking why
the greatest architect isn't here.

392
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,122
Never mind that.
Will Giddings has been badly burned.

393
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:44,083
Will Giddings burned? How?

394
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,336
An ambulance is coming,
but you better think about...

395
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,506
...getting those people down
on the ground floor.

396
00:40:50,756 --> 00:40:53,593
What for?
We got a fire here!

397
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,888
Well, I think
it's under control, but...

398
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,557
Well, then why the urgency?

399
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:01,934
Urgency?

400
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:04,979
If fluky wiring in this building
caused that fire...

401
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,273
...fires could break out everywhere!

402
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:11,152
Doug, I think you're overreacting.

403
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:15,281
I feel sorry for Will Giddings,
but he'll be taken care of.

404
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:19,660
But I won't concern myself with
a fire in a storage room on 81...

405
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:22,622
...because it can't possibly
affect us up here...

406
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:24,875
...not in this building.

407
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:29,671
Now, have someone call me
when the fire department arrives.

408
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:34,885
Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket
and come up and join the party!

409
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:11,380
What building's on the corner
of Montgomery and...

410
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,925
Oh, Jesus!

411
00:42:16,176 --> 00:42:18,095
- The glass tower!
- What?

412
00:42:18,345 --> 00:42:20,138
The glass tower!

413
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:25,561
I sure hope that fire's on
the first floor.

414
00:42:27,437 --> 00:42:29,940
Did you ever fight one
in a high rise?

415
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:37,031
Is it as rough as I hear?

416
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:41,619
Like being inside a chimney.

417
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:03,766
Jesus!

418
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:07,478
How in the hell did they get here
before we did?

419
00:43:08,897 --> 00:43:11,065
Don't anybody
ever stay home anymore?

420
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:38,593
- Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke.
- Eighty-first floor, right?

421
00:43:38,843 --> 00:43:41,262
We've got lobby control,
second alarm is in.

422
00:43:41,513 --> 00:43:43,973
- Set up a Forward Command.
- Got it.

423
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,603
Chief...

424
00:43:48,312 --> 00:43:50,231
...this is Roberts, the architect.

425
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:54,818
- What do we got here, Kappy?
- Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room.

426
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:58,614
It's bad. Smoke's so thick,
we can't tell how far it's spread.

427
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:01,575
- Exhaust system?
- Should've reversed automatically.

428
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:03,369
It must be a motor burnout.

429
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:06,747
- Sprinklers?
- They're not working on 81.

430
00:44:06,997 --> 00:44:09,625
- Why not?
- I don't know.

431
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:12,336
- Jim?
- Yes, sir?

432
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:15,673
Give us a quick refresher on
your standpipe system.

433
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:19,635
- Floors have 3 and 1.5- inch outlets.
- GPM?

434
00:44:19,844 --> 00:44:23,389
Fifteen hundred from ground to 68,
1000 from 68 to 100...

435
00:44:23,597 --> 00:44:25,724
...and 500 from there to the roof.

436
00:44:25,975 --> 00:44:29,270
Are these elevators
programmed for emergencies?

437
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,398
- What floor are your plans on?
- 79. My office.

438
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:36,443
That's two floors below the fire.
It'll be our Forward Command.

439
00:44:36,694 --> 00:44:38,237
Men, take up the equipment.

440
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:39,655
Let's go.

441
00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:48,414
Architects!

442
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:50,124
Yeah, it's all our fault.

443
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:55,922
You know we can't fight a fire
in anything over the 7th floor.

444
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:58,675
But you keep building them
as high as you can.

445
00:45:00,677 --> 00:45:03,513
Are you here to take me on,
or the fire?

446
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,060
What about the 81 st floor?
You got everybody out of there?

447
00:45:10,812 --> 00:45:13,273
I wanna see all floor plans,
81 through 85.

448
00:45:13,523 --> 00:45:14,566
Gotcha.

449
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:18,069
This is what worries me.
Those beams and that glass.

450
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,199
Chief, 81 has been evacuated,
but it doesn't look too good up there.

451
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:24,409
Give me a list of your tenants.

452
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:26,786
Don't worry.
We're moving them out now.

453
00:45:27,037 --> 00:45:28,455
Not live-ins. Businesses.

454
00:45:28,663 --> 00:45:31,458
We lucked up.
Most of them haven't moved in yet.

455
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,460
Those that have are off at night.

456
00:45:33,668 --> 00:45:35,962
I wanna know who they are, not where.

457
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:39,090
What's that got to do with anything?
Who they are?

458
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:41,927
Any wool or silk manufacturers?

459
00:45:42,177 --> 00:45:44,763
In a fire, wool and silk
give off cyanide gas.

460
00:45:45,013 --> 00:45:48,475
Any sporting-good manufacturers,
like table-tennis balls?

461
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:52,437
They give off toxic gases.
Now do you want me to keep going?

462
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:54,981
- One tenant list, coming up.
- Thank you.

463
00:45:58,068 --> 00:45:59,194
What do we got?

464
00:45:59,444 --> 00:46:01,029
Elevator bank, central core.

465
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:04,533
Service elevators here.
Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches.

466
00:46:04,741 --> 00:46:08,120
- Pipe alleys here?
- One, two, three, four, five.

467
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:09,580
- This is south?
- South.

468
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:12,041
Have you got any construction on 81?

469
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:15,628
Anything that can blow up, like
gasoline, fabric cleaner?

470
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:17,463
I don't think so.

471
00:46:17,672 --> 00:46:18,965
Good. I'll be up on 81.

472
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:23,261
For what it's worth, this is one
building I figured wouldn't burn.

473
00:46:24,512 --> 00:46:25,888
Neither did I.

474
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:29,892
And they're celebrating.
A party.

475
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:32,103
What party? Where?

476
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:34,814
In the Promenade Room.
300 people.

477
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:36,566
Why didn't you get them out?

478
00:46:36,774 --> 00:46:40,611
Why don't you go talk to Duncan?
He ain't listening to me.

479
00:46:41,404 --> 00:46:42,488
I will.

480
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:47,702
Here he is now.

481
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:50,204
This is Duncan.

482
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,958
A battalion chief?

483
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,295
I'll watch out for him.
Thank you.

484
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:04,927
Ted, take your men down
to check that hallway.

485
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:06,262
Jack?

486
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:08,639
Jack, how bad?

487
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:12,518
I don't like the looks of it.
It's running the ceiling.

488
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,112
Work it around.
Up there.

489
00:47:25,282 --> 00:47:27,201
- I'll be up topside.
- Right.

490
00:47:31,163 --> 00:47:32,206
Jack...

491
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:33,999
...watch yourself.

492
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:37,127
Keep it high.

493
00:48:13,872 --> 00:48:16,166
- Looking for me, chief?
- If you're Duncan.

494
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:17,459
I am.

495
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:19,253
Everything under control?

496
00:48:19,753 --> 00:48:21,672
Gotta move these people out of here.

497
00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:23,841
Now, just how bad is it?

498
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:26,385
It's a fire, mister, and
all fires are bad.

499
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:31,349
You're not familiar with
the many modern safety systems...

500
00:48:31,558 --> 00:48:33,852
...we have designed into this building.

501
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,311
We've got them all.

502
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:38,690
It's your building, but it's our fire.
Now get out.

503
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,859
I don't think you're listening.

504
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:45,071
A fire on 81 can't reach up here,
not in this building.

505
00:48:46,364 --> 00:48:48,741
- I'll do it.
- Hold it, hold it.

506
00:48:49,701 --> 00:48:51,995
Do you want me to pull rank
with the mayor?

507
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:54,289
With a fire,
I outrank everybody here.

508
00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:56,708
One thing we don't want is a panic.

509
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:58,960
I could tell them, but you ought to.

510
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:02,422
Just make a nice, cool announcement
to all your guests...

511
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,551
...that the party's being moved down
below the fire floor. Now.

512
00:49:46,425 --> 00:49:49,887
Patty, you and Susan stay right here
where I can find you.

513
00:49:50,137 --> 00:49:52,056
Now, don't leave this table.

514
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:54,141
You, I wanna talk to.

515
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:01,649
Did you change any of Doug's
electrical specifications?

516
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,610
- I most certainly did.
- For God's sake, why?

517
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,488
The reason should be obvious,
especially to you.

518
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:08,781
We've got a fire.

519
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:12,284
If it was caused by what you did,
I'll hang you out to dry.

520
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:14,662
And then I'm going to hang you!

521
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:20,334
Would you please stop playing?

522
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,294
Stop playing, will you?

523
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,674
Ladies and gentlemen...

524
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:32,096
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

525
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,433
It seems that we have a small fire...

526
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:39,228
...in one of our storage rooms...

527
00:50:39,478 --> 00:50:41,021
...50 floors below.

528
00:50:41,981 --> 00:50:44,233
I assure you there's no danger.

529
00:50:44,984 --> 00:50:48,571
But in accordance with
the fire department's orders...

530
00:50:49,823 --> 00:50:52,200
...a purely precautionary procedure...

531
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:56,913
...we're going to move the party
down to the lobby for a while.

532
00:50:57,164 --> 00:51:01,084
And we'll be serving cocktails and
champagne in our Continental Room.

533
00:51:01,334 --> 00:51:05,130
But I promise you,
dinner will not be delayed.

534
00:51:05,547 --> 00:51:08,383
Now if we can all move
to the elevators...

535
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,320
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

536
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,989
...there's no reason to rush.

537
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:34,868
Senator Parker, you and your party.

538
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,413
It's really all right.

539
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:41,208
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

540
00:51:46,004 --> 00:51:47,881
- Lisolette!
- Frank!

541
00:51:49,758 --> 00:51:51,134
Lisolette!

542
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:12,615
- How's it going, chief?
- Better get ready.

543
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,952
Kappy, get the floor plans on 82.
We got problems.

544
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,203
Fire lapping?

545
00:52:17,411 --> 00:52:20,373
- Are your com lines tested?
- Phone jacks on every floor.

546
00:52:20,623 --> 00:52:23,042
- I'm plugging into your PA system.
- No sweat.

547
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:25,962
- Emergency setup?
- Battery-powered standby system.

548
00:52:26,212 --> 00:52:29,298
Splice these lines into
our two-way communications van.

549
00:52:29,465 --> 00:52:30,508
Sure.

550
00:52:30,716 --> 00:52:31,926
- No problem?
- No problem.

551
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:34,220
- How long will this take?
- A minute.

552
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,638
Not bad.

553
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:37,640
Here's our problem.

554
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:40,518
The fire's lapping
up through the windows.

555
00:52:42,854 --> 00:52:44,105
Get down! Get down!

556
00:52:46,065 --> 00:52:47,984
What was that?

557
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:54,031
- Come on!
- The ceiling's going!

558
00:52:59,996 --> 00:53:03,457
Men trapped! We need help!
Bring a line!

559
00:53:07,712 --> 00:53:09,338
Pull them out, pull them out!

560
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:12,676
Pass the fire hose!
Pass it along!

561
00:53:26,106 --> 00:53:28,317
Battalion Two to Forward Command.
Urgent!

562
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,319
Forward Command, go ahead.

563
00:53:30,527 --> 00:53:33,739
Explosion on 81, fire headed
toward elevator banks!

564
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:35,991
We need more crews up here fast!

565
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:40,412
- They need relief on 81. Hit it.
- They're on their way.

566
00:53:41,705 --> 00:53:42,748
Done!

567
00:53:42,998 --> 00:53:45,751
Tell Duncan to stop those
Tower Room people...

568
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:49,838
...from using that express elevator,
or somebody'll get killed.

569
00:53:50,088 --> 00:53:51,507
Ring in a third alarm.

570
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:54,426
I want some rescue squads
and some choppers here.

571
00:53:54,676 --> 00:53:57,095
We may need them
to get those people down.

572
00:53:57,346 --> 00:53:58,972
Come on, Park.

573
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:02,309
I'll be on 81.

574
00:54:03,143 --> 00:54:05,020
The fire's moving toward
the main shaft.

575
00:54:05,229 --> 00:54:07,689
Use the scenic elevator.
Don't overload.

576
00:54:13,153 --> 00:54:14,821
I don't like how you talk to me.

577
00:54:15,072 --> 00:54:16,323
- You drunk?
- Not yet.

578
00:54:16,573 --> 00:54:19,409
- Then get out of my way!
- You didn't talk like this before.

579
00:54:19,618 --> 00:54:21,245
Running over budget
and out of money.

580
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:25,667
Did you ask me then to shave
$2,000,000 off our electrical costs?

581
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:27,377
Shut up and help these people!

582
00:54:27,627 --> 00:54:29,796
- Let me ask, father-in-law...
- Excuse me.

583
00:54:30,296 --> 00:54:33,174
Did you encourage other
subcontractors to cut corners?

584
00:54:33,424 --> 00:54:37,136
Where did you save the other
4,000,000 in Doug's original budget?

585
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,194
Please! Please!

586
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,280
Hold everything.

587
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,448
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.

588
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:00,076
Move back into the Promenade Room...

589
00:55:00,326 --> 00:55:03,204
...and we'll take you down by
the scenic elevator.

590
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:07,083
Now these express elevators can be
activated by fire.

591
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:09,878
And with the probability
of short circuits...

592
00:55:10,128 --> 00:55:13,673
...the cars might stop
on the floor where the fire is.

593
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:18,428
So please, we'll use
the scenic elevators over there.

594
00:55:20,305 --> 00:55:22,849
For God's sake, get out of there!

595
00:55:24,184 --> 00:55:25,226
Please, back!

596
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:51,504
It looks bad, Jack.

597
00:55:51,754 --> 00:55:53,464
It is.
I got a couple of men hurt.

598
00:55:53,714 --> 00:55:54,965
The fire's spreading.

599
00:55:55,216 --> 00:55:57,676
I got a third alarm in.
What about this ceiling?

600
00:55:57,927 --> 00:56:01,096
Must have just happened.
I'll check the other corridors.

601
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:04,308
Firemen, let's pull it down
before it falls down.

602
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:10,314
Bring it out! Take it down!

603
00:56:10,606 --> 00:56:12,525
Empty all the water out.

604
00:56:15,986 --> 00:56:17,446
Chief, it's out of control.

605
00:56:17,655 --> 00:56:19,406
Bring in another line!

606
00:56:35,464 --> 00:56:37,132
Get another tank!

607
00:56:57,571 --> 00:56:58,947
Angela?

608
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:00,824
Angela?

609
00:57:02,075 --> 00:57:03,326
Phillip?

610
00:57:04,035 --> 00:57:06,204
Phillip, open the door!

611
00:58:06,891 --> 00:58:09,018
What ideas can I use upstairs...

612
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:11,562
...to explain where I've been
all this time?

613
00:58:11,812 --> 00:58:14,273
Well, what you might do is just...

614
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:19,445
...walk right up to him and say,
"J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...

615
00:58:19,654 --> 00:58:23,407
...but my secretary
had an urgent personal problem."

616
00:58:25,243 --> 00:58:28,621
What happens if
he asks what the problem was?

617
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,498
He won't.

618
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:36,170
- You know what astonishes me?
- What?

619
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,422
You make love with a girl...

620
00:58:38,673 --> 00:58:40,842
...and there's no visible evidence.

621
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:43,970
Nothing to mark the event.

622
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,224
Look at you. You look like you
could be going to church.

623
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:50,935
In this outfit?

624
00:58:52,687 --> 00:58:54,272
I love you.

625
00:58:58,276 --> 00:59:00,528
Did you leave a cigarette burning?

626
00:59:04,282 --> 00:59:06,368
That's not a cigarette.

627
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,597
Jesus!

628
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,190
Get some towels.
Stuff them under the door.

629
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,033
Dan?

630
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:53,707
Right.

631
00:59:56,084 --> 00:59:59,338
- What'd they say?
- Help's on the way.

632
01:00:02,716 --> 01:00:05,010
There's nothing to worry about.

633
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,096
We'll just sit tight
and wait till they get here.

634
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:09,890
I won't panic.

635
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,267
Not to worry, baby.

636
01:00:18,483 --> 01:00:20,985
Please, just join the end of the line.

637
01:00:22,153 --> 01:00:23,780
Oh, no, ma'am.
Please.

638
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,866
But I can't find my daughter.
She's here somewhere.

639
01:00:27,116 --> 01:00:30,036
- They're aware of that.
- She's wearing a purple dress.

640
01:00:30,286 --> 01:00:33,248
- I've got to find her!
- I promise, they'll find her.

641
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:37,293
Now, only 12 at a time.

642
01:00:40,088 --> 01:00:42,090
I'm sorry. That's it.

643
01:00:44,425 --> 01:00:46,719
We'll be in the next group, maybe.

644
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,763
It won't be too long.

645
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:51,683
What's she doing on 87?

646
01:00:55,103 --> 01:00:57,438
Forward Command?
I wanna speak to Jernigan.

647
01:00:58,439 --> 01:00:59,482
Harry.

648
01:01:01,484 --> 01:01:02,569
Jernigan.

649
01:01:04,529 --> 01:01:05,572
What?

650
01:01:05,822 --> 01:01:08,366
Damn it, man!
You should've sent a man up there!

651
01:01:08,575 --> 01:01:11,703
How do you expect her to hear
a phone call? She's deaf!

652
01:01:12,078 --> 01:01:13,997
Sure, the kids can hear!

653
01:01:14,205 --> 01:01:17,542
I don't know, maybe they
were in the shower when you called.

654
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:20,044
You stay there.
I'll get them down!

655
01:01:20,295 --> 01:01:23,631
All my men are committed.
I need fresh crews, damn it!

656
01:01:23,882 --> 01:01:27,177
<i>- We'll send them right up.
- Still got people on 87.</i>

657
01:01:27,427 --> 01:01:28,637
I'll get them down.

658
01:01:33,225 --> 01:01:35,060
I'll give you a hand.

659
01:01:50,951 --> 01:01:52,328
Turn your face away.

660
01:02:16,644 --> 01:02:18,896
There never were any firemen,
were there?

661
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,693
I said that to make it easier on you.

662
01:02:25,819 --> 01:02:28,239
I switched off the phones.

663
01:02:29,698 --> 01:02:31,367
There's no way to call out.

664
01:02:36,038 --> 01:02:38,249
Nobody knows we're up here.

665
01:02:40,836 --> 01:02:43,672
Well, I always did want to die in bed.

666
01:02:48,927 --> 01:02:50,720
Nobody's going to die.

667
01:02:53,098 --> 01:02:56,560
At least they'll never find out
about us, will they?

668
01:03:25,046 --> 01:03:27,883
I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.

669
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:35,557
Don't go!

670
01:03:37,475 --> 01:03:40,770
I'll be back with
the whole fire department.

671
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:42,038
- You all right?
- The mother and children are in there.

672
01:06:42,288 --> 01:06:44,582
- Don't worry. We'll get them out.
- Wait!

673
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:47,210
Please, Mrs. Mueller!
Please stay back.

674
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,630
- What do you think?
- I don't know. Give it a kick.

675
01:06:58,513 --> 01:07:00,139
I'll take the back.

676
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,298
I got Mrs. Allbright.

677
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,469
Anybody in here?!

678
01:08:02,786 --> 01:08:06,040
It's okay, kid. It's okay.
Come on.

679
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:27,853
He's okay.

680
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:30,481
- Mom, Mom!
- Your mom's all right.

681
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:32,983
Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs.

682
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:34,611
Anybody else?

683
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,739
My sister. Where's Angela?

684
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,242
He'll get her.

685
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,797
Angela?

686
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:56,967
Angela?

687
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,789
Angela, where are you?

688
01:09:38,884 --> 01:09:41,011
It's gonna be okay, Angela.

689
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:56,152
Thank God!

690
01:10:35,858 --> 01:10:38,110
Hold it right here.
Hold it right here.

691
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:39,529
- All right!
- That's it.

692
01:10:39,779 --> 01:10:41,405
Don't crush.

693
01:10:52,959 --> 01:10:55,212
It'll take hours
to get everyone down.

694
01:10:55,462 --> 01:11:00,008
Those of us with stout hearts and
trim waistlines should use the stairs.

695
01:11:00,259 --> 01:11:03,929
- That's 135 floors.
- All downhill.

696
01:11:24,324 --> 01:11:26,660
It's closer than they told us.

697
01:11:28,579 --> 01:11:31,623
Let's try the south exit.
That might be clear.

698
01:11:47,347 --> 01:11:48,640
Carlos!

699
01:11:50,017 --> 01:11:52,144
- Yes, sir.
- Help us get this thing open.

700
01:11:52,394 --> 01:11:53,562
Is it stuck?

701
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,357
Here, let me try to kick it.

702
01:12:01,904 --> 01:12:04,573
- I'll call security.
- Yes, sir.

703
01:12:35,313 --> 01:12:38,399
Battalion 38
responding to fourth alarm.

704
01:12:40,151 --> 01:12:42,195
Where are those choppers, Kappy?

705
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:44,030
Navy's been alerted.

706
01:12:47,116 --> 01:12:50,078
Why do they make these goddamn
things so heavy?

707
01:12:50,328 --> 01:12:51,746
You want it easy, chief?

708
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:56,167
They should design a survival suit
for us like for football players.

709
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:58,628
Who pays to see us play?

710
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:06,135
Let's go to work.

711
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:10,348
I need two men up the stairwell
to the tower.

712
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:13,226
The door's jammed.
I want it cleared.

713
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:18,274
Okay, you got it.

714
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:21,360
Timmy, I want you with me.

715
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:24,947
Get two men with 30 minutes of air.
Kappy?

716
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:27,199
Glass will be sailing everywhere.

717
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:31,078
Tell the police to move
those barricades four blocks back.

718
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:33,038
- Got it.
- Let's hit it.

719
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:43,132
Yo! Security guard.
Anyone here?

720
01:13:51,056 --> 01:13:52,683
Hello. Security.

721
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:03,903
Say, kitty, almost missed you.

722
01:14:12,036 --> 01:14:13,704
Keep away from the walls.

723
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:17,041
There's fire on the other side.

724
01:14:30,388 --> 01:14:31,848
Wait a minute.

725
01:14:36,436 --> 01:14:38,813
It's a ruptured gas line.
Get back!

726
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:01,044
Oh, my God!

727
01:15:57,935 --> 01:16:00,104
Is there any way you can get down?

728
01:16:00,646 --> 01:16:02,481
I think I can.

729
01:16:02,732 --> 01:16:03,816
Phillip!

730
01:16:04,525 --> 01:16:06,110
Let him try.

731
01:16:07,653 --> 01:16:08,988
There's no other way.

732
01:16:37,934 --> 01:16:39,810
Come on, Phillip!
Come on.

733
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:41,604
That part's easy.

734
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,156
Come on, boy. Easy does it.

735
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:53,242
Get your foot over there.

736
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:00,749
Ease down.

737
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,794
Come on, Phillip.
Come on, Phillip!

738
01:17:18,308 --> 01:17:22,062
It's just a couple of inches away now.
There you go.

739
01:17:22,396 --> 01:17:23,480
Easy.

740
01:17:24,523 --> 01:17:25,774
Easy.

741
01:17:28,235 --> 01:17:29,945
Don't look down!

742
01:17:33,574 --> 01:17:34,950
Come on.

743
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,494
I gotcha. I gotcha.

744
01:17:47,171 --> 01:17:51,842
We were supposed to have fire drills,
but nobody ever told me anything.

745
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:56,054
They said we would have fire drills.
But they never did.

746
01:18:01,394 --> 01:18:03,313
It's going to be all right.

747
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:28,755
It's going to be all right.

748
01:18:56,574 --> 01:18:57,951
You all right?

749
01:18:59,285 --> 01:19:00,662
You know, I had a...

750
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:04,916
I got up, but I'll have trouble
getting down. Can you help me?

751
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:09,420
Could you just hold on
around my neck, real tight?

752
01:19:12,633 --> 01:19:14,468
Come on. Give it a try.

753
01:19:17,221 --> 01:19:21,141
Just put your arms around me,
and you tell me what to do.

754
01:19:21,392 --> 01:19:23,185
Put her legs down.

755
01:19:23,936 --> 01:19:27,439
Hold on tight.
Hold on real tight, now.

756
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:33,821
Just hold on tight.

757
01:19:34,029 --> 01:19:35,447
Hold on.

758
01:20:17,281 --> 01:20:19,074
Hold on tight, now.

759
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:27,918
It's gonna be okay now.

760
01:20:33,256 --> 01:20:34,716
Hold on!

761
01:20:35,008 --> 01:20:36,384
Easy now.

762
01:20:36,843 --> 01:20:39,346
- Hold on, Angela.
- I've got ahold of you!

763
01:20:39,596 --> 01:20:41,598
Get your arms around my neck!

764
01:20:41,806 --> 01:20:43,058
Thattagirl.

765
01:20:54,194 --> 01:20:55,362
Nurse?

766
01:21:10,627 --> 01:21:12,963
Mrs. Mueller, come on!
You gotta try!

767
01:21:14,297 --> 01:21:16,216
Take it slowly, now.

768
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,357
You've got about a foot to go.

769
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:16,694
Feel around with your feet now.

770
01:22:16,944 --> 01:22:18,196
Can you see it?

771
01:22:23,784 --> 01:22:27,121
Hold on to that pole
and grab ahold of my belt.

772
01:22:36,714 --> 01:22:38,633
Try to get your hand over there.

773
01:22:44,681 --> 01:22:47,142
Come on, half a foot.
Six inches.

774
01:22:48,602 --> 01:22:50,270
Try to swing now.

775
01:22:51,772 --> 01:22:53,815
Just try to pendulum.

776
01:22:55,067 --> 01:22:56,527
Can you swing?

777
01:22:58,737 --> 01:23:01,740
Come on.
Just get to me over here.

778
01:23:02,407 --> 01:23:04,243
Mrs. Mueller!

779
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:15,295
Are you all right?

780
01:23:19,007 --> 01:23:20,926
All right, let's go.

781
01:23:40,195 --> 01:23:42,030
Come on. Come on.

782
01:23:46,368 --> 01:23:47,828
I'm coming.

783
01:23:48,537 --> 01:23:49,913
I'm coming.

784
01:24:02,594 --> 01:24:03,720
You okay?

785
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:10,560
Nobody's gonna get down this way.

786
01:24:14,105 --> 01:24:16,399
Oh, God! We're cut off.

787
01:24:17,317 --> 01:24:19,569
Well, the only way is up.

788
01:24:19,819 --> 01:24:21,196
Come on, let's go.

789
01:24:37,629 --> 01:24:38,838
Chief O'Hallorhan?

790
01:24:39,088 --> 01:24:41,841
Inside, security phone on the right.

791
01:24:50,391 --> 01:24:53,520
- Get me Chief O'Hallorhan.
- I'm trying to get through now.

792
01:24:58,399 --> 01:24:59,484
Can't we go down?

793
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:03,571
The fire's below us. We gotta go up,
underneath the Promenade Room.

794
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:04,989
Come on!

795
01:25:16,293 --> 01:25:17,503
Tim, get that phone.

796
01:25:17,753 --> 01:25:20,214
Check your ventilating
systems over here.

797
01:25:21,882 --> 01:25:23,843
I'll send up another truck company.

798
01:25:24,051 --> 01:25:26,303
Pull this ceiling,
and vent that other side.

799
01:25:26,512 --> 01:25:28,806
It's the copter air-control officer.

800
01:25:29,056 --> 01:25:31,892
Thank you. Jack, I know you've
been hitting it.

801
01:25:32,142 --> 01:25:34,311
I'm getting relief
for you and your men.

802
01:25:40,609 --> 01:25:42,152
Who am I speaking to?

803
01:25:42,361 --> 01:25:44,780
Chief Flaker, sir.
U.S. Navy, Air Rescue.

804
01:25:44,989 --> 01:25:47,491
It's about time.
We need your rescue choppers.

805
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:52,037
Right away. Our communications will
be near the Forward Command center.

806
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:54,957
No, too dangerous.
Stay out of those elevators.

807
01:25:55,165 --> 01:25:57,376
Then, sir, we'll just trot
up the stairs.

808
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:00,337
You'll just trot right up to 79, huh?

809
01:26:01,088 --> 01:26:02,590
Standing by in the lobby.

810
01:26:02,798 --> 01:26:04,216
Thank you.

811
01:26:33,205 --> 01:26:35,373
This ain't gonna help any!

812
01:26:41,338 --> 01:26:44,382
They won't hear us in there.
There's 300 people!

813
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:48,011
It's a fire door. It's over
2.5 inches thick.

814
01:26:48,929 --> 01:26:50,722
I could crawl through the duct.

815
01:26:50,931 --> 01:26:53,558
Will we be able to go with you?

816
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:58,021
That leads to a pipe shaft
that's 135 floors straight down.

817
01:27:01,858 --> 01:27:06,780
Phillip, take care of these ladies.
They're your responsibility now.

818
01:28:17,351 --> 01:28:18,936
All right, I'll tell him.

819
01:28:21,564 --> 01:28:23,941
- How is it on 65?
- They're containing it.

820
01:28:24,192 --> 01:28:25,818
Well, it's still below us.

821
01:28:26,027 --> 01:28:29,572
Let's take a look.
Okay, watch the electrics.

822
01:28:48,342 --> 01:28:49,426
Come here!

823
01:28:50,677 --> 01:28:52,930
The master generator's blown.

824
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:57,267
The backup should've kicked on.
See what's holding up our starters.

825
01:29:09,154 --> 01:29:10,656
What happened?

826
01:29:15,285 --> 01:29:16,954
Where the hell are we?

827
01:29:33,262 --> 01:29:37,140
Security, this is Duncan.
Have the main breakers gone?

828
01:29:39,935 --> 01:29:41,728
The whole system's failed.

829
01:29:42,187 --> 01:29:45,274
What's the last report
on the firemen getting here?

830
01:29:45,899 --> 01:29:47,526
Are they on their way?

831
01:29:49,904 --> 01:29:51,948
Hold on to me a second.

832
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:33,990
Hold on!

833
01:30:37,619 --> 01:30:39,329
Christ!
That's one of our men!

834
01:30:39,579 --> 01:30:40,955
Oh, God!

835
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:47,128
Go down by rope.
Better get it.

836
01:30:47,378 --> 01:30:48,671
Sir?

837
01:30:48,922 --> 01:30:53,510
We'll rappel down to 65 and use
the top of that elevator as an exit.

838
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,387
Why not pry open the doors
at this level?

839
01:30:57,889 --> 01:30:59,767
I don't think so.

840
01:31:00,017 --> 01:31:01,519
I can't make it.

841
01:31:01,769 --> 01:31:04,522
I'll fall.
I know I'll fall.

842
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:09,568
Then you better go first.

843
01:31:09,818 --> 01:31:13,280
That way, when you fall,
you won't take any of us with you.

844
01:31:25,751 --> 01:31:26,961
Let's go to work.

845
01:31:37,555 --> 01:31:39,723
Check all rooms
in that corridor.

846
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,893
Check this room.

847
01:31:47,773 --> 01:31:49,567
Tear it down.

848
01:32:49,211 --> 01:32:51,922
See? Just like we
taught you in training.

849
01:32:54,591 --> 01:32:56,092
Open it up.

850
01:33:06,394 --> 01:33:08,396
Of course I read you!

851
01:33:08,647 --> 01:33:12,067
I don't know where he is,
but if I see him, I'll tell him.

852
01:33:13,985 --> 01:33:17,197
- Must be an easier way to get to a fire.
- Not for us.

853
01:33:17,447 --> 01:33:20,492
- Where've you been?
- We had trouble getting here.

854
01:33:20,742 --> 01:33:23,037
The Navy flight commander needs you.

855
01:33:23,287 --> 01:33:24,914
Just walk 65 floors down?

856
01:33:25,164 --> 01:33:28,626
Only five. A freight elevator
on 60's running auxiliary power.

857
01:33:28,834 --> 01:33:30,920
- Got it controlled?
- Getting there.

858
01:33:31,128 --> 01:33:34,507
You men stay here with the chief.
Tell him I'm on my way.

859
01:33:34,757 --> 01:33:36,092
Oh, Mike...

860
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:39,053
This one of your men?

861
01:33:40,763 --> 01:33:42,390
"Dan Bigelow."
Nope.

862
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,475
Must be a civilian.

863
01:33:51,274 --> 01:33:53,192
Okay to O'Hallorhan.
He's on his way.

864
01:34:20,303 --> 01:34:21,345
Look!

865
01:34:21,721 --> 01:34:23,598
There's another one there!

866
01:34:51,168 --> 01:34:54,254
Carlos, give me that security phone,
will you?

867
01:34:54,504 --> 01:34:55,923
How'd you get in here?

868
01:34:56,173 --> 01:34:58,175
I'll give it to you later.

869
01:34:58,675 --> 01:35:00,135
Give me O'Hallorhan.

870
01:35:01,136 --> 01:35:02,179
Anybody'll do.

871
01:35:02,429 --> 01:35:06,225
Listen, the south stairwell is
blocked. Cement, for chrissake!

872
01:35:06,475 --> 01:35:09,311
Can you send somebody up
to break it loose?

873
01:35:10,437 --> 01:35:12,564
They're on their way?
How...?

874
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:19,863
Oh, my Lord, Elke.
My poor cat.

875
01:35:20,072 --> 01:35:21,782
She's still in the apartment.

876
01:35:22,032 --> 01:35:25,077
I'm sure the fire
didn't get up that high yet.

877
01:35:25,327 --> 01:35:27,120
She'll be all right.

878
01:35:33,085 --> 01:35:34,920
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

879
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:38,465
- How're you doing?
- We're fine. Glad to see you.

880
01:35:38,715 --> 01:35:41,760
That's the door right there.
It's blocked with cement.

881
01:35:51,521 --> 01:35:53,857
We're gonna have to blow that thing.

882
01:35:59,696 --> 01:36:01,364
Mrs. Mueller?

883
01:36:01,614 --> 01:36:03,241
It's Mr. Roberts!

884
01:36:06,035 --> 01:36:07,829
Mrs. Mueller! Phillip!

885
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:11,332
We hear you.
We're gonna blow this door.

886
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:13,251
Get everybody clear.

887
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:16,212
You've got about 30 seconds.
Understood?

888
01:36:18,756 --> 01:36:20,091
Understood!

889
01:36:24,721 --> 01:36:27,849
Okay, ma'am, let's get down there.
Out of the way.

890
01:36:29,559 --> 01:36:32,103
Please go back.
They're gonna dynamite this door.

891
01:36:32,312 --> 01:36:34,898
Step back, please.
We're blowing the door.

892
01:36:37,483 --> 01:36:38,902
Okay, get down low.

893
01:36:45,074 --> 01:36:48,995
- What kind of explosives are you using?
- It's plastic C-4.

894
01:36:49,245 --> 01:36:50,538
Blow a hole in anything.

895
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:05,804
Here, shine this on the bag for me.

896
01:37:07,014 --> 01:37:08,849
That's it. Keep it up here.

897
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,729
Is there gonna be a bang?

898
01:37:13,979 --> 01:37:17,691
Nothing for you to worry about, baby.
You'll be safe.

899
01:37:20,236 --> 01:37:22,696
Okay, everybody ready?

900
01:37:41,006 --> 01:37:42,716
Good going, Brian.

901
01:37:46,554 --> 01:37:47,930
You all right?

902
01:37:58,983 --> 01:38:01,735
I'm James Duncan.
Can we get down that way?

903
01:38:01,986 --> 01:38:05,949
No, not a chance, sir.
The stairway below is completely gone.

904
01:38:23,174 --> 01:38:24,843
Everyone, listen!

905
01:38:25,135 --> 01:38:27,220
- Hold it down!
- Listen!

906
01:38:29,514 --> 01:38:32,976
I've been informed
that there's no possibility...

907
01:38:33,185 --> 01:38:35,770
...of using this stairway to get out.

908
01:38:36,021 --> 01:38:38,273
Now, I'm sorry.

909
01:38:42,444 --> 01:38:43,612
Patty...

910
01:38:44,446 --> 01:38:47,365
There's still a chance
we can get out of here.

911
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,744
Didn't you hear what my father said?
You can't get out that way.

912
01:38:50,994 --> 01:38:54,247
Are you coming or not?

913
01:39:00,170 --> 01:39:03,632
If you have to wait for permission
to save your own life, go ahead.

914
01:39:04,132 --> 01:39:06,760
- I'm getting out.
- Roger, you...

915
01:39:44,173 --> 01:39:45,341
Come on!

916
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:46,592
Come on!

917
01:39:48,177 --> 01:39:51,597
Let's go. You guys, hose the ceiling.

918
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:55,142
You two, in there!

919
01:40:00,022 --> 01:40:04,402
- I guess you thought I stood you up.
- It crossed my mind.

920
01:40:05,611 --> 01:40:07,446
You sure you're all right?

921
01:40:09,824 --> 01:40:13,619
Those helicopters, they'll get
us out of here, won't they?

922
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:16,622
Sure they will
if there's not too much wind.

923
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:19,959
Some party.

924
01:40:30,637 --> 01:40:32,681
Can I get you anything else?

925
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:07,007
The choppers are here, but the winds
make a landing attempt too risky.

926
01:41:07,257 --> 01:41:09,885
Get some men on top of
the Peerless Building...

927
01:41:10,135 --> 01:41:12,554
...and get a breeches buoy
to the Promenade Room.

928
01:41:12,804 --> 01:41:15,224
We can't shoot a line that far
in this wind.

929
01:41:15,432 --> 01:41:17,643
Why not shoot it from a chopper?

930
01:41:17,893 --> 01:41:19,603
I'll get right on it.

931
01:41:22,564 --> 01:41:25,651
- Doc?
- Chief, the ceiling fell in on him.

932
01:41:25,859 --> 01:41:29,404
By the time I got to him,
he was covered with hot stuff.

933
01:41:54,305 --> 01:41:57,767
Pretty ridiculous spectacle,
right?

934
01:41:57,976 --> 01:42:00,895
- There's no way down.
- Thank God you're all right.

935
01:42:02,647 --> 01:42:06,860
- Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go?
- I know what I'm gonna do.

936
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:08,820
Get quietly drunk.

937
01:42:11,447 --> 01:42:14,868
If you're responsible for this,
I know what you must be feeling.

938
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:17,370
You don't know the meaning
of the word.

939
01:42:17,787 --> 01:42:19,205
- Responsible?
- Feeling!

940
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:23,001
You know about responsibility.
It's a family trait.

941
01:42:23,251 --> 01:42:26,921
Duncans are big in that department,
at least on the surface.

942
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:31,342
That's not fair! I don't think
it's wrong to feel a sense of duty.

943
01:42:31,551 --> 01:42:35,763
Sometimes, when you turn
the exact same phrase...

944
01:42:36,014 --> 01:42:38,057
...lift an eyebrow
in the exact same way...

945
01:42:38,266 --> 01:42:40,768
...I see and I hear your father.

946
01:42:40,977 --> 01:42:42,729
The two of you, one!

947
01:42:42,979 --> 01:42:46,691
Like a big tree and a little tree
in its shade, where the acorn fell.

948
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:52,031
Roger, I came over here to you
because I thought you might need me.

949
01:42:56,785 --> 01:42:58,037
Right now...

950
01:42:59,288 --> 01:43:01,040
...what I need most...

951
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:02,833
...is this.

952
01:43:08,756 --> 01:43:12,760
I promised myself if I ever saw you
again, I'd make a full confession.

953
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:14,345
No, but thank you.

954
01:43:14,595 --> 01:43:18,140
- But you don't know anything about me.
- But I do.

955
01:43:18,933 --> 01:43:20,601
You're penniless...

956
01:43:20,851 --> 01:43:23,354
...you have no villa
in the south of France...

957
01:43:23,562 --> 01:43:26,857
...no antiques coming, no paintings.

958
01:43:27,107 --> 01:43:28,734
But, Harlee, I don't care.

959
01:43:31,278 --> 01:43:34,573
I'm a cheap tinhorn.
A two-bit con man.

960
01:43:34,823 --> 01:43:38,118
Not cheap.
Maybe unsuccessful.

961
01:43:38,327 --> 01:43:40,621
But you see,
your heart isn't in it.

962
01:43:40,871 --> 01:43:43,207
How can you cheat people
effectively...

963
01:43:43,457 --> 01:43:45,626
...if you don't enjoy cheating them?

964
01:43:46,001 --> 01:43:50,798
I came here to sell you 1000 shares
in Greater Anaheim Power and Light!

965
01:43:51,465 --> 01:43:52,508
Is it a good investment?

966
01:43:52,716 --> 01:43:55,427
There is no
Greater Anaheim Power and Light.

967
01:43:55,678 --> 01:43:57,513
Only the certificate I had printed.

968
01:43:57,763 --> 01:44:01,768
I think you'd have admired
the artwork. Beautiful engraving.

969
01:44:01,977 --> 01:44:03,520
I'd like to see it.

970
01:44:05,355 --> 01:44:06,648
It's in my jacket.

971
01:44:06,857 --> 01:44:10,402
I took the jacket off.
It was needed elsewhere.

972
01:44:10,819 --> 01:44:12,070
You see what I mean?

973
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:15,615
I can't even deliver
a phony stock certificate.

974
01:44:18,869 --> 01:44:20,370
Did you hear what I said?

975
01:44:22,163 --> 01:44:23,665
Every word.

976
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,585
Then tell me you're shocked...

977
01:44:26,835 --> 01:44:28,670
...or at least disappointed.

978
01:44:28,879 --> 01:44:31,464
- But I'm not.
- You must be!

979
01:44:32,173 --> 01:44:34,175
Harlee, I'm not.

980
01:44:49,858 --> 01:44:51,484
I'll be right back.

981
01:44:53,028 --> 01:44:55,488
Give me a few minutes with Doug,
will you, dear?

982
01:44:55,739 --> 01:44:57,115
Sure.

983
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:10,253
Will Giddings is dead.

984
01:45:12,381 --> 01:45:14,717
He died 20 minutes ago.

985
01:45:19,513 --> 01:45:20,848
Oh, boy.

986
01:45:25,311 --> 01:45:28,231
I wonder how many more
will be dead tomorrow?

987
01:45:28,481 --> 01:45:30,358
I thought we were
building something...

988
01:45:30,608 --> 01:45:33,611
...where people could work,
live and be safe.

989
01:45:33,861 --> 01:45:38,199
If you had to cut costs, why didn't
you cut floors instead of corners?

990
01:45:39,283 --> 01:45:40,910
Now listen.

991
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:46,249
Any decisions that were made for the
use of alternate building materials...

992
01:45:46,457 --> 01:45:50,711
...were made because I, as a builder,
have a right to make those decisions.

993
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:53,839
If I remain within the building code,
and goddamn it, I did!

994
01:45:54,048 --> 01:45:56,300
Oh, here we go again!

995
01:45:56,509 --> 01:45:57,927
The building code. Come on.

996
01:45:58,135 --> 01:46:00,763
That's a standard cop-out
when you're in trouble!

997
01:46:00,972 --> 01:46:03,057
I was crawling around up there.

998
01:46:03,307 --> 01:46:05,852
The duct holes weren't fire-stopped!

999
01:46:06,102 --> 01:46:09,522
Corridors without fire doors
and the sprinklers won't work.

1000
01:46:09,772 --> 01:46:12,817
And an electrical system
that's good for what?

1001
01:46:13,067 --> 01:46:15,319
I mean, it's good for starting fires!

1002
01:46:16,153 --> 01:46:18,656
Where was I
when all this was going on?

1003
01:46:18,906 --> 01:46:23,245
Because I'm just as guilty as you
and that goddamn son-in-law of yours!

1004
01:46:24,621 --> 01:46:27,040
What do they call it
when you kill people?

1005
01:46:48,228 --> 01:46:50,147
- Who is it?
- Chief O'Hallorhan.

1006
01:46:50,397 --> 01:46:53,358
- What happened?
- Part of the central corridor just blew.

1007
01:46:53,609 --> 01:46:55,068
We've got in the fifth alarm.

1008
01:46:56,403 --> 01:46:57,571
The helicopters?

1009
01:46:57,779 --> 01:47:02,618
It's too windy. We'll set up the
breeches buoy on the Peerless Building.

1010
01:47:04,119 --> 01:47:05,412
What can we do to help?

1011
01:47:06,246 --> 01:47:08,665
Move your combustible material
away from the window.

1012
01:47:10,167 --> 01:47:11,627
Okay, gotcha.

1013
01:47:25,432 --> 01:47:28,101
There's nobody on those drapes.
Let's get them.

1014
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:30,395
Jake, give me a hand.

1015
01:48:09,644 --> 01:48:10,979
Did you reach her?

1016
01:48:11,229 --> 01:48:12,939
The phones are all out.

1017
01:48:13,857 --> 01:48:17,318
Just a little while longer,
and we'll all be home together.

1018
01:48:18,361 --> 01:48:21,072
If only I could have talked to her.

1019
01:48:21,656 --> 01:48:24,200
Let her know we were thinking of her.

1020
01:48:25,869 --> 01:48:29,831
Told her how precious she is to us.

1021
01:48:34,085 --> 01:48:36,504
She's still such a child.

1022
01:48:37,797 --> 01:48:41,718
She doesn't even know where I keep
the key to the safety deposit box.

1023
01:48:41,968 --> 01:48:44,013
How will she be able to get into it?

1024
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:47,725
I mean...

1025
01:48:49,226 --> 01:48:50,686
...if she should have to.

1026
01:48:54,523 --> 01:48:56,942
The things you think of.

1027
01:48:58,235 --> 01:48:59,862
Do you wanna help me?

1028
01:49:07,244 --> 01:49:09,914
- Here he is.
- The wind's down a little.

1029
01:49:10,164 --> 01:49:12,583
We're gonna try for a landing.

1030
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:14,668
Get Roberts.

1031
01:49:21,008 --> 01:49:24,511
Get 10 people on the roof.
Have the rest stand by.

1032
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,263
We're gonna start airlifting.

1033
01:49:26,472 --> 01:49:28,015
Will do.

1034
01:49:31,602 --> 01:49:33,562
Put these over there.

1035
01:49:33,812 --> 01:49:36,190
Give me a pad of paper and a pencil.

1036
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,359
Give me that brandy snifter too.

1037
01:49:38,609 --> 01:49:41,403
- Doug, are they going to land?
- They're gonna try.

1038
01:49:41,654 --> 01:49:44,615
We'll send the kids out first,
then the women.

1039
01:49:44,865 --> 01:49:46,825
Number these up to 100 or so.

1040
01:49:47,076 --> 01:49:48,744
High-rise roulette.

1041
01:49:48,994 --> 01:49:51,789
High-rise roulette. That's right.

1042
01:49:52,998 --> 01:49:56,211
- There may not be time to tell you...
- There will be.

1043
01:49:56,461 --> 01:49:58,296
I'll go tell everybody.

1044
01:49:58,547 --> 01:50:00,382
Pass those out when you're ready.

1045
01:50:28,118 --> 01:50:32,247
There'll be a lot of wind up there,
so everybody stay in one group.

1046
01:50:32,497 --> 01:50:33,707
Come on.

1047
01:50:50,056 --> 01:50:51,683
Stay back, stay back!

1048
01:50:57,314 --> 01:50:58,523
Look out!

1049
01:51:42,568 --> 01:51:44,445
Roberts! Roberts!

1050
01:51:44,695 --> 01:51:47,156
Chief O'Hallorhan
wants to speak to you.

1051
01:51:47,406 --> 01:51:50,660
All right, make way.
Coming through, coming through!

1052
01:51:55,957 --> 01:51:57,750
Here he is now.

1053
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:03,965
Roberts, I know those pilots
are dead, and I...

1054
01:52:04,632 --> 01:52:06,467
God, it was just awful up there.

1055
01:52:08,135 --> 01:52:11,097
Listen, our best chance now
is the breeches buoy.

1056
01:52:11,347 --> 01:52:13,724
I told my two firemen
to knock out a window.

1057
01:52:13,975 --> 01:52:16,144
We'll try to shoot a line
from a chopper.

1058
01:52:24,236 --> 01:52:27,072
Hey, one of you guys
got a pair of clippers?

1059
01:52:27,322 --> 01:52:30,909
- Sure, what do you want them for?
- I want to try something.

1060
01:52:43,005 --> 01:52:46,133
Step back. The firemen
are gonna knock out the windows.

1061
01:52:46,508 --> 01:52:48,677
Step back and you won't get hurt.

1062
01:54:39,832 --> 01:54:42,293
May I have your attention, please?

1063
01:54:43,627 --> 01:54:46,672
We've activated a gravity brake on
that outside elevator.

1064
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:50,426
There's no power to bring it back up,
but at least we can get 12 people out.

1065
01:54:50,634 --> 01:54:52,219
Which 12?

1066
01:54:52,386 --> 01:54:55,556
The same group that was
up on the roof and two additions.

1067
01:54:55,764 --> 01:54:58,976
The woman who saved the children's
lives and a fireman!

1068
01:54:59,226 --> 01:55:01,478
I want a trained man in there.

1069
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:05,232
All right, let's move it out!

1070
01:55:13,115 --> 01:55:14,241
Marge!

1071
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:17,328
Take this. Take it!
You can get out! Go on.

1072
01:55:17,536 --> 01:55:18,996
What are you doing?

1073
01:55:21,123 --> 01:55:22,333
I'm sorry.

1074
01:55:26,253 --> 01:55:28,547
I want you out of here.

1075
01:55:28,756 --> 01:55:31,926
So you can stop worrying about me?
What about me worrying about you?

1076
01:55:32,176 --> 01:55:34,178
It's the only way you can help me.

1077
01:55:34,386 --> 01:55:35,888
Help me.

1078
01:55:49,236 --> 01:55:51,863
If you asked me
to go to the North Pole...

1079
01:55:52,113 --> 01:55:55,700
...or even the cliffs of Mendocino,
I'd go.

1080
01:55:56,493 --> 01:55:58,828
What if I ask you tomorrow?

1081
01:56:08,713 --> 01:56:09,881
Please.

1082
01:56:13,718 --> 01:56:16,137
- Ma'am, I'll take her.
- Thank you.

1083
01:56:16,388 --> 01:56:17,806
Come on, Phillip.

1084
01:56:20,809 --> 01:56:23,353
I'll never let you go anywhere
without me again.

1085
01:56:23,603 --> 01:56:25,355
I don't want to.

1086
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:27,190
Ever again.

1087
01:56:30,569 --> 01:56:33,071
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- I'll be waiting.

1088
01:56:33,321 --> 01:56:35,115
We're still a lady short.

1089
01:56:36,032 --> 01:56:38,201
- You've gotta go.
- I don't want to leave you.

1090
01:56:38,451 --> 01:56:40,537
Honey, I'll make it.
I promise you.

1091
01:56:40,745 --> 01:56:43,665
Have I ever broken a promise to you?

1092
01:56:46,251 --> 01:56:48,044
Good luck, honey.

1093
01:56:49,546 --> 01:56:50,589
Please.

1094
01:56:52,382 --> 01:56:54,092
All set, everyone?

1095
01:57:03,769 --> 01:57:05,146
Okay, here we go.

1096
01:58:47,332 --> 01:58:49,001
Out of sight!

1097
01:58:50,627 --> 01:58:52,337
Yeah, it's coming.

1098
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:56,550
Let's untie this, take it off,
pull in the rest of the line!

1099
01:58:56,758 --> 01:58:59,678
Okay, come on.
Let's get it through.

1100
01:59:12,441 --> 01:59:13,817
All right,
hold it right there!

1101
01:59:14,067 --> 01:59:17,154
Bring in another 20 feet
of that main line.

1102
01:59:26,748 --> 01:59:27,999
That's it.

1103
01:59:29,542 --> 01:59:31,252
All right, bring in a little more!

1104
01:59:31,502 --> 01:59:34,464
That's it. Hold it now.
Brace yourselves.

1105
01:59:41,763 --> 01:59:43,264
Watch your heads!

1106
01:59:46,893 --> 01:59:49,771
Grab it! Take it back and secure it!

1107
01:59:53,066 --> 01:59:55,527
All right, let it go!
Let it go!

1108
01:59:55,735 --> 01:59:58,321
All right, go on!
Take it out!

1109
02:00:11,042 --> 02:00:12,669
Okay, take ahold.

1110
02:00:23,513 --> 02:00:25,682
How about the main line?
Secured?

1111
02:00:25,932 --> 02:00:27,433
Good!

1112
02:01:17,234 --> 02:01:18,527
Chief!

1113
02:01:22,364 --> 02:01:24,283
Explosion above 110...

1114
02:01:24,533 --> 02:01:28,537
...blew the elevator off its track.
It's hanging by a cable.

1115
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:35,419
- How many people in it?
- Loaded. I'd say about 12.

1116
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:43,345
What're you gonna go?

1117
02:01:50,185 --> 02:01:51,478
Flaker.

1118
02:01:52,312 --> 02:01:54,814
- Flaker!
- Sir?

1119
02:01:56,358 --> 02:01:59,945
Can you give me a chopper
with a winch and some cable?

1120
02:02:00,195 --> 02:02:02,447
Have them pick me up on the
Peerless Building.

1121
02:02:02,697 --> 02:02:03,782
Got it.

1122
02:02:07,619 --> 02:02:10,247
Try and get a hitch on that elevator.

1123
02:02:10,539 --> 02:02:13,375
Drop it down to the deck
by the chopper.

1124
02:02:22,259 --> 02:02:24,427
Mommy, Mommy!

1125
02:02:34,229 --> 02:02:37,148
I won't cry if you won't cry.

1126
02:02:42,737 --> 02:02:43,780
It's all right.

1127
02:03:00,882 --> 02:03:03,426
Yeah, take it up out of there.

1128
02:03:09,348 --> 02:03:11,142
Pull it. Come on!

1129
02:03:12,143 --> 02:03:13,644
Tie it over there.

1130
02:03:27,909 --> 02:03:29,410
Okay, let her go!

1131
02:03:32,163 --> 02:03:33,873
Look out below!

1132
02:03:38,544 --> 02:03:39,921
Come on.

1133
02:03:41,464 --> 02:03:43,466
Okay, that's it.

1134
02:03:52,767 --> 02:03:54,644
All right!
There's one in there!

1135
02:03:55,019 --> 02:03:56,479
Come on! Pull it in!

1136
02:04:06,698 --> 02:04:09,910
All right, let's haul
that chair in! Come on!

1137
02:04:12,704 --> 02:04:13,914
That's it!

1138
02:04:19,127 --> 02:04:21,004
All right, keep it going!

1139
02:04:21,713 --> 02:04:23,924
All right, hold it right there.

1140
02:04:25,384 --> 02:04:26,593
Who's next in order?

1141
02:04:27,052 --> 02:04:28,387
I am. I am!

1142
02:04:28,679 --> 02:04:31,056
- Come ahead!
- I can't do that.

1143
02:04:31,306 --> 02:04:32,683
Yes, you can.

1144
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,440
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.

1145
02:04:40,691 --> 02:04:42,276
Oh, God!
Don't let go of me!

1146
02:04:42,484 --> 02:04:44,778
Don't let go of me!
Don't let me fall!

1147
02:04:46,488 --> 02:04:48,115
Don't let go!

1148
02:04:50,701 --> 02:04:52,286
Don't let go of me!

1149
02:05:25,778 --> 02:05:27,238
Get me out, please!

1150
02:05:27,447 --> 02:05:29,199
Hold it right there.

1151
02:05:38,875 --> 02:05:40,960
Okay, lower the cable.

1152
02:05:46,174 --> 02:05:47,800
Grab that hook!

1153
02:05:48,051 --> 02:05:49,219
Steady.

1154
02:05:51,179 --> 02:05:52,764
What about the torch?

1155
02:05:53,431 --> 02:05:55,058
Lash it tight.

1156
02:06:00,563 --> 02:06:04,025
<i>- This is O'Hallorhan.
- We read you, chief.</i>

1157
02:06:04,317 --> 02:06:06,361
Pick me up with the hook...

1158
02:06:06,611 --> 02:06:09,864
...and set me down on the
scenic elevator.

1159
02:06:10,073 --> 02:06:15,203
Then you'll pick up the elevator
and gently set it down on the street.

1160
02:06:15,537 --> 02:06:16,996
Can you handle the weight?

1161
02:06:17,247 --> 02:06:21,751
<i>I think we can handle it.
We'll find out in a hurry.</i>

1162
02:06:41,438 --> 02:06:43,023
Watch it!

1163
02:06:47,903 --> 02:06:49,488
Take it away!

1164
02:07:19,101 --> 02:07:21,186
How much time do we have?

1165
02:07:23,689 --> 02:07:25,149
I wish I knew.

1166
02:07:25,858 --> 02:07:28,694
Goddamn it, Jim,
you built the place!

1167
02:07:34,366 --> 02:07:37,704
I just don't think that
all of us are gonna make it.

1168
02:08:35,262 --> 02:08:37,305
Well, I guess I'm next.

1169
02:08:37,973 --> 02:08:40,225
I don't suppose you'll let me stay.

1170
02:08:44,062 --> 02:08:46,064
Come on. I'll see you soon.

1171
02:08:54,699 --> 02:08:56,284
I love you.

1172
02:09:00,121 --> 02:09:01,706
Let it go!

1173
02:09:59,014 --> 02:10:00,515
You think this'll hold it?

1174
02:10:00,766 --> 02:10:04,186
It'd better.
We have to cut the elevator cable.

1175
02:10:12,903 --> 02:10:14,988
- What's your number?
- 68.

1176
02:10:15,155 --> 02:10:16,198
47.

1177
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:07,162
Here, Mrs. Ramsay,
you'll be all right now.

1178
02:13:07,913 --> 02:13:11,125
- You'll be all right.
- Tell my husband I'm all right.

1179
02:13:11,333 --> 02:13:13,586
- Tell him I'll be all right.
- I will.

1180
02:13:13,794 --> 02:13:17,798
- And I'll see him at home later.
- I will.

1181
02:13:18,591 --> 02:13:19,675
Let's go.

1182
02:13:27,766 --> 02:13:29,476
Oh, my God, you're all right!

1183
02:13:29,727 --> 02:13:31,980
Thank God you're all right!

1184
02:13:34,065 --> 02:13:35,108
Watch the ladder.

1185
02:14:20,153 --> 02:14:21,404
Hey, Mike...

1186
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:23,698
...deputy wants to see you.

1187
02:14:35,835 --> 02:14:39,339
Mike, we've been checking
the situation in the Promenade Room.

1188
02:14:40,048 --> 02:14:43,302
We figure they've got
17 or 18 minutes left, if that.

1189
02:14:43,553 --> 02:14:46,514
It'll take more than 3 hours
to get them down by breeches buoy.

1190
02:14:46,722 --> 02:14:49,183
They'll die up there
if something's not done.

1191
02:14:49,433 --> 02:14:51,018
We might have the answer.

1192
02:14:51,269 --> 02:14:55,022
Johnson's a structural engineer.
Tell the chief your calculations.

1193
02:14:55,231 --> 02:14:58,234
The structural strength
of the joists in that room...

1194
02:14:58,484 --> 02:15:01,070
...could definitely
withstand the explosion.

1195
02:15:03,531 --> 02:15:04,615
What explosion?

1196
02:15:06,659 --> 02:15:08,870
Chief, we've got the copter ready.

1197
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:10,746
Wait a minute. We'll handle that.

1198
02:15:10,997 --> 02:15:12,915
Just get back to your job.

1199
02:15:15,042 --> 02:15:16,460
Yes, sir.

1200
02:15:18,588 --> 02:15:19,630
What explosion?

1201
02:15:19,881 --> 02:15:22,967
We can blow the tanks
two floors above the Promenade Room.

1202
02:15:23,217 --> 02:15:27,305
They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water.
That's enough to drown the fire.

1203
02:15:30,558 --> 02:15:33,978
- You're crazy.
- Mike, it's the only way.

1204
02:15:34,353 --> 02:15:37,023
You could kill everybody up there.

1205
02:15:37,231 --> 02:15:38,608
I don't think so.

1206
02:15:39,817 --> 02:15:40,860
You don't think?

1207
02:15:41,068 --> 02:15:44,238
When you take into account the stress
factors, the design...

1208
02:15:44,447 --> 02:15:46,824
Wait a minute. Just hold it.

1209
02:15:47,074 --> 02:15:48,951
We've already made the decision.

1210
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:52,997
Someone has got to go up there,
rig the charges and blow them.

1211
02:15:53,248 --> 02:15:57,586
There's only two people qualified
for that. You and Conners.

1212
02:15:57,836 --> 02:16:02,758
They just brought Conners down.
He's on his way to the burn center.

1213
02:16:03,675 --> 02:16:07,346
Under the circumstances,
we can't order you to go up there.

1214
02:16:07,596 --> 02:16:10,057
I'm just laying it out for you.

1215
02:16:11,308 --> 02:16:12,434
But you...

1216
02:16:13,810 --> 02:16:15,437
You see how it is, don't you?

1217
02:16:19,650 --> 02:16:21,360
How do I get back down?

1218
02:16:27,491 --> 02:16:29,660
Oh, shit!

1219
02:16:56,353 --> 02:16:57,646
The women are gone.

1220
02:16:59,064 --> 02:17:01,149
We are going next.

1221
02:17:12,912 --> 02:17:14,998
You've all got numbers.

1222
02:17:15,206 --> 02:17:17,333
And you're gonna take your turn.

1223
02:17:17,917 --> 02:17:20,545
And if it's any consolation...

1224
02:17:23,256 --> 02:17:27,719
...I'll be the last one out of here
along with my son-in-law.

1225
02:17:38,062 --> 02:17:40,940
It's out of control.
And it's coming your way.

1226
02:17:44,193 --> 02:17:46,404
You got about 15 minutes.

1227
02:17:47,572 --> 02:17:49,532
Now, they want to try something.

1228
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:52,619
They wanna blow those
water tanks above you.

1229
02:17:52,827 --> 02:17:54,454
They think it'll kill the fire.

1230
02:18:02,003 --> 02:18:04,172
How are they gonna get the
explosives up here?

1231
02:18:06,090 --> 02:18:09,177
They'll find some dumb
son of a bitch to bring it up.

1232
02:18:16,936 --> 02:18:18,938
Hang on, I'll tell them.

1233
02:18:23,609 --> 02:18:27,363
They want to put out the fire by
blowing the water tanks above us.

1234
02:18:27,738 --> 02:18:32,076
We'll eat a lot of water and concrete,
but if they don't try it, we'll burn.

1235
02:18:32,284 --> 02:18:34,078
The fire's out of control.

1236
02:18:34,662 --> 02:18:37,289
They think we got maybe 15 minutes.

1237
02:18:37,957 --> 02:18:41,627
This way, some of us might survive.
We got no options.

1238
02:18:48,717 --> 02:18:51,095
Come on. Let's go.

1239
02:18:54,431 --> 02:18:56,058
Get that line.

1240
02:19:05,276 --> 02:19:06,485
Get off!

1241
02:19:06,694 --> 02:19:09,947
- You crazy bastards! Drop this line!
- Let go of me!

1242
02:19:10,197 --> 02:19:12,449
Drop the line.
It's not gonna work.

1243
02:19:14,076 --> 02:19:16,287
It won't hold everybody!

1244
02:19:17,413 --> 02:19:18,789
Get off!

1245
02:19:19,915 --> 02:19:21,125
Get off!

1246
02:19:22,501 --> 02:19:24,044
- Get the hell out of there!
- Go!

1247
02:19:32,387 --> 02:19:33,805
Get off.

1248
02:19:44,733 --> 02:19:45,775
Chief.

1249
02:19:50,196 --> 02:19:53,200
We lost the breeches buoy.
It was panic up here.

1250
02:19:53,408 --> 02:19:54,659
It's under control now.

1251
02:19:56,411 --> 02:20:00,290
I'll try and set down on the roof.
I'll need you up there.

1252
02:20:01,917 --> 02:20:04,794
I know where to place the charges,
but I don't know how.

1253
02:20:05,712 --> 02:20:07,172
I know how.

1254
02:20:11,593 --> 02:20:13,220
See you up there.

1255
02:20:20,727 --> 02:20:24,814
You'll have to tie yourselves down.
Ropes, tablecloths, belts...

1256
02:20:25,065 --> 02:20:26,816
...anything you can find!

1257
02:20:27,067 --> 02:20:28,443
- Carlos!
- Yes, sir.

1258
02:20:28,693 --> 02:20:30,320
Get some knives.

1259
02:20:33,907 --> 02:20:34,950
There we go.

1260
02:20:37,745 --> 02:20:41,415
For God's sakes, Carlos. Don't tie
yourself up to a lot of glass.

1261
02:20:41,666 --> 02:20:43,084
That's the '29.

1262
02:21:26,669 --> 02:21:27,879
Try it.

1263
02:21:30,047 --> 02:21:31,424
It's okay.

1264
02:21:37,221 --> 02:21:38,306
Doug...

1265
02:21:39,807 --> 02:21:42,310
...I never thought this could happen.

1266
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:43,728
Sure.

1267
02:24:14,131 --> 02:24:17,760
- How much time you think we got?
- Ten minutes, maybe less.

1268
02:24:18,636 --> 02:24:22,139
We'll have to blow the floors
as well as the tanks, you know.

1269
02:24:22,389 --> 02:24:24,725
All right. This is your detonator.

1270
02:24:24,975 --> 02:24:28,729
You're running instantaneous.
I'm running delayed. Here you go.

1271
02:24:28,979 --> 02:24:31,440
This is your explosive.
This is the timer.

1272
02:24:31,690 --> 02:24:33,609
Later on,
after you throw the wire...

1273
02:24:33,859 --> 02:24:38,489
...we'll plug it and splice it into
the timer, set it, and it blows.

1274
02:24:41,158 --> 02:24:44,787
Set your explosive like this.

1275
02:24:49,291 --> 02:24:52,836
Take your detonator,
pull the plug.

1276
02:24:54,213 --> 02:24:55,589
Toss it.

1277
02:24:59,552 --> 02:25:02,054
- Got it?
- I got it.

1278
02:26:15,962 --> 02:26:18,798
- Good luck. See you later.
- Okay, thanks.

1279
02:27:01,634 --> 02:27:03,010
Here you go.

1280
02:27:23,698 --> 02:27:25,241
What will you set it for?

1281
02:27:26,033 --> 02:27:27,410
Five.

1282
02:27:29,787 --> 02:27:31,789
I think we can make that.

1283
02:27:36,002 --> 02:27:37,044
That's it.

1284
02:28:12,080 --> 02:28:14,291
Tie yourselves down, goddamn it!

1285
02:28:29,806 --> 02:28:33,310
You'll never make it through there.
How much time?

1286
02:28:33,518 --> 02:28:34,978
Three and a half.

1287
02:28:35,812 --> 02:28:36,855
Here.

1288
02:28:38,899 --> 02:28:39,942
Here.

1289
02:29:20,358 --> 02:29:21,901
I'm burning up!

1290
02:29:30,952 --> 02:29:32,328
Let's go!

1291
02:29:39,127 --> 02:29:40,461
Fireman?

1292
02:33:22,144 --> 02:33:23,396
Bob!

1293
02:33:23,646 --> 02:33:24,855
Bob!

1294
02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:20,136
Excuse me.

1295
02:37:20,595 --> 02:37:24,516
She was in the elevator with you.
The fine-looking lady. Mrs. Mueller.

1296
02:37:24,766 --> 02:37:26,226
Have you seen her?

1297
02:37:28,395 --> 02:37:30,981
I'm sorry, she's dead.

1298
02:37:40,740 --> 02:37:41,992
Lisa!

1299
02:37:42,909 --> 02:37:44,077
Lisa!

1300
02:37:46,621 --> 02:37:48,874
- Claiborne!
- What?

1301
02:38:40,676 --> 02:38:43,095
I didn't want you to see him.

1302
02:38:45,681 --> 02:38:50,686
You know, there's nothing any of us
can do to bring back the dead.

1303
02:38:59,862 --> 02:39:03,115
All I can do now is pray to God...

1304
02:39:04,659 --> 02:39:07,912
...that I can stop this from
ever happening again.

1305
02:39:47,077 --> 02:39:48,579
I don't know.

1306
02:39:49,079 --> 02:39:51,915
Maybe they just ought to leave it
the way it is.

1307
02:39:52,165 --> 02:39:55,878
Kind of a shrine to all
the bullshit in the world.

1308
02:40:04,803 --> 02:40:08,974
You know, we were lucky tonight.
Body count's less than 200.

1309
02:40:09,725 --> 02:40:14,479
One of these days, they'll kill
10,000 in one of these firetraps.

1310
02:40:15,355 --> 02:40:18,233
And I'll keep eating smoke
and bringing out bodies...

1311
02:40:18,817 --> 02:40:21,194
...until somebody asks us...

1312
02:40:22,321 --> 02:40:23,780
...how to build them.

1313
02:40:35,334 --> 02:40:38,754
Okay. I'm asking.

1314
02:40:40,297 --> 02:40:42,175
You know where to reach me.

1315
02:40:43,635 --> 02:40:45,303
So long, architect.
