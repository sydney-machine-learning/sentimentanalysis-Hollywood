00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,679
Ms. Roberts,

4
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,349
is it true that while we are
here at this news conference,

5
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,267
the Indians are honoring
the students who were killed,

6
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,229
in a special burial ceremony
out on the reservation?

7
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,438
Ms. Roberts,

8
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,731
has it ever happened before

9
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,942
that so many thousands
of rounds of ammunition

10
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,234
were fired
into the dormitories

11
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,528
in such a short period
of time?

12
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,532
It happened many times
before here.

13
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:04,118
Kent state,
the orangeburg massacre--

14
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,455
27 kids were shot
at that one.

15
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,958
Or Jackson state
or Houston,

16
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,169
any one
of a dozen others.

17
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,463
Students are slaughtered
by trigger happy police,

18
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,549
and nothing
is ever done about it.

19
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,593
Besides Billy Jack,
who else was shot?

20
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,304
How many
were actually killed?

21
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,561
There were three deaths,

22
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,938
and two still
on the critical list.

23
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,863

24
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,805
<i>Dr. Bernard russert,</i>

25
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,014
<i>Dr. russert.</i>

26
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,473
Has Washington replied

27
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,768
to your request
for an investigation?

28
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,979
Are you kidding?

29
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,940
Remember after Kent state

30
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,816
how Attorney General
John Mitchell said

31
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,487
there was no need to explore
the causes of the killings

32
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,988
because he knew in advance

33
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,407
the causes
couldn't possibly be

34
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,742
the national guard
or the police.

35
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,077
But didn't an FBI
report subsequently prove

36
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,497
that there were no shots fired
by the students

37
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,042
but there was grave culpability
on the part of the guard?

38
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,002
They sure did.

39
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,672
But, as usual, Washington
did nothing about it.

40
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,424
Does this mean that it's
the end of the school?

41
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,925
Will you have to close
it down now?

42
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,265
Maybe.

43
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,558
Maybe not.

44
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,270
I honestly don't know
at this point.

45
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,691
I'm sorry, folks,
Ms. Roberts is very tired.

46
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,610
You're going to have to leave.

47
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,822
Thank you, Ms. Roberts.

48
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,205
My publisher still
thinks that it's vital

49
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,540
that a book be done
about your school

50
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,376
and how the massacre
happened there.

51
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,505
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

52
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,757
Maybe you could start with
the arrest of Billy Jack.

53
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,470
Wasn't it what happened
at the trial

54
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,015
that made you so determined
to make the school succeed?

55
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,061
Yes.

56
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,732
That was-- what--

57
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,109
four, four and half years ago.

58
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,072
Wasn't Billy Jack's
main belief

59
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,909
that a man who doesn't go
his own way is nothing?

60
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,079
That's right.

61
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,874
That's why they tried Billy.

62
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,959
But we all knew that
what they were really trying

63
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,089
was each man's right
to find his own center,

64
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,590
to follow his own conscience

65
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,050
and to do his own thing

66
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,971
without hurting or interfering
with anybody else's.

67
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,561
<i>That ideal, to all of us,
was Billy Jack.</i>

68
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,271
What your saying, then,

69
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,398
is that it doesn't make
any difference to you

70
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,899
whether this jury finds you
innocent or guilty,

71
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,780
and it doesn't make
any difference to you

72
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,657
whether you live or die.

73
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,327
You expect us to believe

74
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,456
that you have absolutely
no fear of the death penalty?

75
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,461
I have a lot of fear,

76
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,922
but I have a lot more respect.

77
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,635
Long ago I learned that he
is my constant companion.

78
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,511
He eats with me,
he walks with me,

79
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,472
he even sleeps with me.

80
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,517
I'm sorry, I must have
missed something back there.

81
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,145
Who is this faithful
companion of yours?

82
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,442
- Death.
- Oh, I see.

83
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,155
Tell me, is this death
companion business

84
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,241
some special part
of your Indian beliefs?

85
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,659
No.

86
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,745
Every one of us has death
as his constant companion.

87
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,540
He sits with every one of us
every second of our lives,

88
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,501
only we're too terrified
to really think about that,

89
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,169
but once you do,

90
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,839
it will completely change
your entire outlook on life.

91
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,508
How so?

92
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,009
You ask yourself,

93
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,387
even in
the most serious crisis,

94
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,097
how important
would this really be

95
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,348
if I were suddenly told

96
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,017
that I just had
one more week to live?

97
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,104
So, you learn to take
nothing too seriously.

98
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,772
On the other hand,

99
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,191
you ask yourself,

100
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,234
if this were
my last act on earth,

101
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,153
is this what
i really want to do?

102
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,738
So you learn on the one hand

103
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,867
to be detached from the
temporary things of this world,

104
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,160
and on the other hand
you learn to appreciate

105
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,496
every little thing in it
all the more.

106
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,543
<i>During the trial,
sheriff Cole resigned,</i>

107
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,253
<i>and posner,</i>

108
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,464
<i>who never really quite recovered
from the death of his son,</i>

109
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,008
<i>sold out all of his companies</i>

110
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,551
<i>to his brother the banker,</i>

111
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,594
<i>and he quietly left town.</i>

112
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,847
<i>And though we were happy
about it then,</i>

113
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>it turned out to be
one of the worst things</i>

114
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,851
<i>that ever happened to us.</i>

115
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,853
<i>The prosecution,
for it's part,</i>

116
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,647
savagely attacked
our character

117
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,734
<i>and tried to make it look
like I wasn't even raped.</i>

118
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,611
So miss Garrison lies,
and you swear to it.

119
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,698
- Objection.
- Sustained.

120
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,241
Now, Ms. Roberts,

121
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,411
isn't it true
that you were never raped?

122
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,578
Isn't it true

123
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,122
that you made up this story

124
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,666
in a desperate attempt

125
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,334
to try and justify

126
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,127
the violent
and insane killing

127
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,420
by the man you love?

128
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,712
Objection.

129
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,091
Order.

130
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,220
I feel terribly sorry for
your children, Mr. Williams.

131
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,556
You feel sorry
for my children?

132
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,308
Yes, and you, too.

133
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,103
You know me,
and you know I don't lie.

134
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,856
It must be terribly
degrading for you to pretend

135
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,692
in front of all
of these people, that I do,

136
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,110
just to earn your money.

137
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,783
Yes, I was proud
to go through west point.

138
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,702
I was taught there
a code of honor and manliness

139
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,621
that, while it went
overboard at times,

140
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,205
I basically liked.

141
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,791
Yet you brought charges
against your own officers,

142
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,877
including two staff commanders
and a general.

143
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,462
That's right.

144
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,798
I charged them with the
deliberate and senseless

145
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,092
slaughtering of innocent women
and children in the field

146
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,346
either directly
or by men under their command,

147
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,806
and by failing to report
these atrocities

148
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,351
or covering them up
with full knowledge of same.

149
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,353
And after you proffered
these charges,

150
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,314
the army suddenly made up
charges against you,

151
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,567
of cowardice in the field,

152
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,986
and they offered to drop
these charges against you

153
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,321
if you would drop them
against the officers.

154
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,656
That's correct.

155
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,908
And did you refuse
to drop the charges?

156
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,619
I did refuse

157
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,412
could you please tell us
in your own words

158
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,248
exactly what led up to your
refusing to obey

159
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,582
this order in the field?

160
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,837
Was it before
or after my lai?

161
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,048
It was about seven months
before my lai.

162
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,843
We were out
on a search-and-destroy mission

163
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,555
on a small
south vietnamese Hamlet.

164
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,014
Just like at my lai,

165
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,725
there had been plenty
of advance warnings,

166
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,185
so when we got there,
there was no resistance,

167
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,229
no military in sight.

168
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,523
Not a shot was fired.

169
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,982
All the village
was filled with

170
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,527
was women, children,
and old men.

171
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,820
They were frightened
and very eager to please,

172
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,324
so we quickly herded them up
into a ditch,

173
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,660
and we sat around waiting
for several hours

174
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,204
for some word
from headquarters

175
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,372
as to what we were to do
with them.

176
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,791
People in the meantime

177
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,835
were kept in the ditch
in the boiling sun,

178
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,586
and were not allowed
to relieve themselves

179
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,589
or go for any water.

180
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,048
Get them in the ditch!

181
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,050
Way down to the end.

182
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,685
There must be some mistake.

183
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,729
There's no mistake, sir.

184
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,564
The order was perfectly clear.

185
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,695
Get me headquarters
on the phone again.

186
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,990
Give me that phone.
I want to hear it myself.

187
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:10,039
If you fellows refuse,
all hell can break loose.

188
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,665
You know that.

189
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,462
Are you absolutely sure, sir?

190
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,465
There can be no mistake
down the line?

191
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,053
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.

192
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,353
Waste them.

193
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,024
You mean the civilians?

194
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,321
That's the order,
clear as hell.

195
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,781
Direct from Saigon.

196
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,240
We're to waste them.

197
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,079
All right,
all you men on your feet.

198
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,214
Think clearly, now.

199
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,968
You disobey this order,
and they can hang you.

200
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,886
Lock and load!

201
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,605
God almighty.

202
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,733
What's happening to us?

203
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,652
Aim!

204
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,285
Fire!

205
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,279
So it was this
senseless slaughter

206
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,114
and sadistic brutality

207
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,033
coming as official orders
from Washington

208
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,285
that turned you
against America.

209
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,120
No, not really.

210
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,206
In war,
when you've brainwashed men

211
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,832
to become
cold-blooded killers,

212
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,126
you expect them to kill.

213
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,879
Then what was it that made
you bitter toward America?

214
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,173
- Lieutenant calley.
- Lieutenant calley?

215
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,468
You mean because he was tried
for war crimes at my lai?

216
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,262
No, he should have been tried.

217
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,848
And so should all those
colonels and generals

218
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,267
and white-house aids

219
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,518
who ordered the whole affair

220
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,437
but were mysteriously let off
scot-free.

221
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,773
Then why lieutenant calley?

222
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,609
Because America made him
into such a great hero.

223
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,030
To me they were sick and
diseased men filled with evil,

224
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,656
who cut
innocent women's throats

225
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,533
and blew out the brains
of babies,

226
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,161
and America had raised him up

227
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,413
and made him an national idol.

228
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,457
What was that part

229
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,543
about the president
switching his colors?

230
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,836
On December 81969,

231
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,880
every newspaper
in this country

232
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,633
carried president Nixon's
sacred promise

233
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,968
that he would personally
investigate my lai

234
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,553
and he would personally
see to it

235
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,014
that everyone involved,
if they were found guilty,

236
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,058
was punished
to the full limit of the law.

237
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,311
And so you feel that since
every officer involved to date

238
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,730
has gone free,

239
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,232
Nixon failed his pledge.

240
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,652
Like any other mealy-mouth
sell-out politician,

241
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,779
when he found out that he could
get more votes

242
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,491
by supporting calley,
he did a complete flip flop.

243
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,660
And when I saw
that the American people

244
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,994
supported him in this,

245
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,707
I knew then that the American
conscience was dead

246
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,251
and that the great spirit
of this nation,

247
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,337
which to me began back in
Boston and Virginia

248
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,715
dufing
the American revolution,

249
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,008
that it could never again
be revived.

250
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,847
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

251
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,765
have you reached a decision?

252
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,684
We have, your honor.

253
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,893
We the jury,

254
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,437
unanimously find Billy Jack

255
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,189
guilty of involuntary
manslaughter.

256
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,208
Well, that's that.

257
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,045
I think you'll find
that the end

258
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,466
of your little school
out there, doc.

259
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,050
Well, it's not my school,

260
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,595
but, I'll take a bet on it.

261
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,807
Billy Jack wasn't the center
of power of that school.

262
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,976
Who, then?
Jean?

263
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:44,146
You know,
to prove something for Billy,

264
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,398
she's going to make
that place grow and grow.

265
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,151
My guess is it's going
to take off like a brush fire.

266
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,902
That quiet little girl?

267
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,072
That quiet little girl, my butt.
That's like saying a

268
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,576
rattle snake's got a
quiet little bite.

269
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,663
For all our sakes,
i hope your wrong.

270
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,332
Respecting
your good intentions, doc,

271
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,460
when people have such wildly
different attitudes,

272
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,670
there's no way
they are going to live together

273
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,964
without generating violence.

274
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,717
We've all had
too much of that already.

275
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,974
<i>So, though the trial of
Billy Jack as a person was over</i>

276
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,476
and he was sentenced
from 5-15 years

277
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,019
in the state penitentiary,

278
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,604
the kids decided

279
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,524
that Billy Jack was really
kind of a symbol to live by

280
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,484
and that the trial
of Billy Jack

281
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,612
as that kind of an ideal,
had just begun.

282
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,364
So they immediately set out

283
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,908
to make the school bigger
and better than ever before.

284
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,122
That first year
that Billy was in prison,

285
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,834
they found an old abandoned
military academy,

286
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,294
which they renovated entirely
by themselves,

287
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,881
begging, borrowing and
scrounging everywhere they could

288
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,259
for money or materials
to make it go.

289
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,136
Listen, everybody.

290
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,806
L just had a bakery that donated
100 loaves of bread.

291
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,395
<i>The entire school was built
and owned by the kids,</i>

292
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,147
<i>and they governed themselves
on the simple philosophy</i>

293
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,899
<i>that where there is power,</i>

294
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,318
<i>there can never be love,</i>

295
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,819
and where there is love,

296
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,821
there's no need for power.

297
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,157
<i>Knowing that you can't really
deal and understand other people</i>

298
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,870
<i>until you first understand
yourself, every program was</i>

299
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,038
<i>based on learning how to
cope and understand</i>

300
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,915
<i>your own feelings first</i>

301
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,377
<i>in order to understand
and relate to other people.</i>

302
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,339
<i>This philosophy
they carried into everything,</i>

303
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,508
from meditation
and body awareness exercises,

304
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,677
<i>all kinds of dance,</i>

305
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,554
<i>even belly dancing.</i>

306
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,598
<i>Music, band, drill team,</i>

307
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,851
<i>arts, crafts,
advanced physics,</i>

308
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,353
<i>mathematics, psychology,</i>

309
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,022
<i>the classics,</i>

310
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,273
<i>even into athletics,</i>

311
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,275
<i>which they called
yoga athletics.</i>

312
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,194
<i>From yoga tennis
to yoga football,</i>

313
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,614
and <i>every</i> sport in between.

314
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,198
<i>The idea always being</i>

315
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,700
<i>that the thrill
of participating</i>

316
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,537
<i>and the self discipline one
develops while training,</i>

317
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,372
<i>preparing and learning,</i>

318
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,124
<i>made one a winner
for the rest of his life,</i>

319
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>no matter how well he played</i>

320
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,755
<i>or how the temporary
contest came out.</i>

321
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,548
<i>And so winning and losing</i>

322
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,801
<i>or worrying about someone
grading your efforts</i>

323
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:22,304
<i>was just not all
that important anymore.</i>

324
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,473
<i>Growing and having the fun
and privilege of doing--</i>

325
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,601
<i>that was everything.</i>

326
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,894
<i>I heard something
about taking the Grant</i>

327
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,564
<i>that was given as part of the
deal for Billy Jack's surrender</i>

328
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,650
<i>and then building
a radio station</i>

329
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,235
<i>or a recording studio
or something like that.</i>

330
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,904
<i>That's right.</i>

331
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,822
<i>They went out and sold their
own recordings door to door</i>

332
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,159
<i>and the royalties really helped
the school to continue to grow.</i>

333
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,624
<i>With some of the royalties,</i>

334
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,960
<i>they started an institute
for child abuse</i>

335
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,045
<i>and children's rights,</i>

336
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,798
<i>and in working with these abused
and orphaned children,</i>

337
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,176
<i>they were stunned to find out
what was secretly going on</i>

338
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:46,471
<i>in children's orphanages
and juvenile courts,</i>

339
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:50,350
<i>state institutions for
disturbed and retarded children,</i>

340
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,851
<i>children's hospitals,
and education in general.</i>

341
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,189
<i>Was that when they started</i>

342
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,318
<i>their nader-type newspaper
and magazine</i>

343
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,320
<i>and then began
those scorching exposes</i>

344
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,863
<i>on government corruption
and consumer rip-off.</i>

345
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,364
<i>That's right.</i>

346
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,866
<i>And it was
in doing those exposés</i>

347
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,743
<i>that our troubles
really began.</i>

348
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,036
We've been digging.

349
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,205
Remember back in December
of '73

350
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,499
when the-- the interior
department,

351
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,667
called in,

352
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,670
was it 250 oil executives

353
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,922
to work
on the fuel allocation, right?

354
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,673
So we started digging
behind that,

355
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,510
and we found out that the
oil barons and the white house

356
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,678
manipulated
the whole energy crisis,

357
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,430
including the Israeli war,

358
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,765
for just unbelievable profits.

359
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,268
It makes the Alaskan pipeline
look like kids' stuff.

360
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,604
But are you aware
what could happen?

361
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,440
I mean, that could blow
the dome off the capitol.

362
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,776
I mean we'd have the FBI,
the CIA, the plumbers,

363
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,153
the plumbers' plumbers,

364
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,364
the sequel to the plumbers...
It'd be a tremendous blow.

365
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,949
You know what they can do?

366
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,702
If we don't tell our sources
they can arrest us.

367
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,121
Just like that.

368
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,082
She's absolutely right,
i mean, it happened in '72.

369
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:59,582
The la times spent $200,000 in
legal fees defending their

370
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,215
reporters who were subpoenaed
to reveal their sources.

371
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,591
I mean that's the la times.

372
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,552
We don't stand a chance.

373
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,971
They're either gonna blow us
up altogether, or they're

374
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,723
just gonna close
the school down.

375
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,394
I want to do an expose
on the IBM ribbon conspiracy.

376
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,818
<i>The fantastic reader
response made the kids</i>

377
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,612
<i>determined to bring these
exposes to a wider public</i>

378
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:29,491
<i>so they decided to build
their own TV station.</i>

379
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,285
<i>They put on a fourth of July-
type fundraising drive</i>

380
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:36,786
<i>which they called "1984 is
closer than you think."</i>

381
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,752
<i>And it culminated in the largest
drill team and band marathon</i>

382
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,005
<i>ever held in this country.</i>

383
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:46,174
Kids came from all over the us
and Canada at their own expense,

384
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:50,012
<i>and every day and night the
donated coliseum was filled.</i>

385
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,098
Just pull it down.
Hurry up. You're on next.

386
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,818
H'

387
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,284
<i>was that before or
after Billy got out of prison?</i>

388
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,953
<i>No, it was just before.</i>

389
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,998
<i>I</i> remember because Ford had just
shocked the nation

390
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:22,085
<i>by pardoning Nixon and agreeing
to let him destroy the tapes.</i>

391
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:26,048
<i>We were all so angry at the way
politicians at every level</i>

392
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,800
<i>of government constantly used
television to lie,</i>

393
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,886
con and manipulate people.

394
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,304
<i>Oh, I know.</i>

395
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,140
<i>I covered a candidate
in California once who had</i>

396
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,059
<i>campaign contributions
from the oil companies.</i>

397
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,480
Would you believe he <i>dared</i> to
advertise himself as the one

398
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,024
<i>the oil companies feared
the most?</i>

399
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,568
<i>That's right. And because
of things like that the</i>

400
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,071
<i>kids decided to fight fire with
fire before it was too late.</i>

401
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,407
<i>I mean, look at how they
packaged Nixon</i>

402
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,326
<i>as the law and order candidate
who would bind the nation's</i>

403
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,162
<i>wounds and bring
us all together.</i>

404
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,955
<i>Well, we all bought it.</i>

405
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:02,209
<i>That's right. So the kids
decided to use television</i>

406
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,753
<i>to fight television
before it was too late.</i>

407
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,172
<i>And they took their
investigations being done in</i>

408
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,092
<i>the magazines right into the
streets where the public could</i>

409
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,178
see for themselves the secret
deals and rip-offs right where

410
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,221
they were happening.

411
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,765
So in other words,
Mrs. Childs,

412
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,683
you missed one payment while
you were in the hospital.

413
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,353
No, I missed three payments.

414
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,105
I was behind before I went
into the hospital.

415
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,774
Okay. So you missed three
payments and then they

416
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,358
repossessed your furniture.

417
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,861
And when you went to
make up the payments,

418
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,905
you had found that
they destroyed your furniture

419
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,698
and repossessed it and now

420
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,035
they refuse to refund the money
to you on which you paid on it

421
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,080
two years before they
repossessed it.

422
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,373
- Now ,is that correct?
- Honey, that's correct.

423
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:46,874
Twenty-three years in this town
doing a helluva job, just

424
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:51,462
following orders, and because
of one crazy nigger, I'm dead.

425
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,885
It's not the woman.

426
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,889
It's that school
and their TV station.

427
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,475
I think the manager's going to
come out. Get on camera two.

428
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,810
Okay. All right.

429
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,271
Excuse me. Um, we think
as assistant manager

430
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,983
that we should have
the store's side of the story

431
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,819
so that we can have all of the
viewpoints presented fairly.

432
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,945
May we have a comment?

433
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,488
No comment.

434
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,824
We were just trying
to be fair, sir.

435
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,076
We tried.

436
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,787
Hello?

437
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:20,829
Yes, sir.

438
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,996
Just a minute, please.

439
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,957
Telephone, Mr. bromner.

440
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,458
It's the home office.

441
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,174
Yes, sir.

442
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,260
Well, thank you, sir.

443
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,637
It's a tough situation.

444
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,306
Right.

445
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,309
Well, I just went according
to the manual, sir.

446
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,520
Right away.

447
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,523
Replace the old lady's
furniture.

448
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,774
With used furniture?

449
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,358
With brand-new.

450
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,944
It just hit the wire services.

451
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,113
Those crazy, lousy kids.

452
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:55,989
What do they think,

453
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,782
I wanted to take
the old lady's furniture?

454
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,454
<i>It was shortly after that
they started bugging our phones</i>

455
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,166
<i>and the FBI started making
mysterious and routine calls to</i>

456
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,335
<i>the school pretending that it
was was for clearances</i>

457
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,671
<i>for the federal Grant that the
government had been giving us</i>

458
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,007
<i>ever since Billy Jack
surrendered.</i>

459
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,801
<i>I guess it was at that point</i>

460
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,553
<i>that I really should
have realized</i>

461
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,472
<i>and made the kids stop.</i>

462
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,308
<i>Did you have proof
that your phones were bugged?</i>

463
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:27,437
<i>Yeah, one of the kids, a
graduate of Cal tech, I think,</i>

464
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,773
not only developed a device
<i>which</i> could tell us when

465
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,027
<i>our phone was being tapped but
he and another couple of</i>

466
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,947
electronic geniuses developed a
lie detector <i>that</i> was even more

467
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,783
<i>accurate than the
polygraph machine.</i>

468
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,743
I don't get it,
how does it work?

469
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,163
Well, just by a person's voice
alone, off the telephone or off

470
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,874
or off the television.

471
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,334
It's even more accurate than
a normal lie detector.

472
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,919
I don't believe it.

473
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,129
Well, watch the--

474
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,923
watch the thing and
watch the needle.

475
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,884
And so it is your contention
then, governor, that the threat

476
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,846
of exposure by the freedom
school television station

477
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,015
will in no way find any
wrongdoing or kickback

478
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:08,186
of this federal money ever
touching the state capitol?

479
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,522
As god is myjudge, Mr. mudd,

480
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,775
if there were a stack of bibles
on this table before me,

481
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,861
I swear to you that I have
absolutely no knowledge

482
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:20,198
of any kind of corruption
by any member of my staff.

483
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,202
- Not one.
- Wow.

484
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,871
Good lord, that guy's lying
through his teeth.

485
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,622
Grover, think of what
this machine would do

486
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,792
to the advertising industry,
it'd just blow it apart.

487
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,043
Think of what we
could have saved

488
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,003
on the Watergate hearings.

489
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,379
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

490
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,797
I've got an idea.

491
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,715
Why don't we get the tapes
to the Watergate hearings

492
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,093
and run them off on this thing
and finally find out the truth?

493
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,396
Pardon me, Mrs. merrick,
we're from the FBI

494
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,316
and, uh, we'd just like to ask
you a few routine questions

495
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,318
about your child.

496
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,569
Is something wrong?

497
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,571
No, uh, does she go
to the freedom school?

498
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,989
Yes, sir.

499
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,074
Do you know about the
TV station that they operate?

500
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,201
Yes, sir.

501
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,702
Does she have anything
to do with that?

502
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,494
No. No, she doesn't.

503
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,497
<i>Now, during all
this time Billy was in prison,</i>

504
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,665
<i>did you visit him regularly?</i>

505
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,542
<i>No. Billy's humiliation
at being caged up</i>

506
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,168
<i>like an animal was so great</i>

507
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,422
<i>that he wouldn't let
any of us visit him. Ever.</i>

508
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,840
<i>For all four years?</i>

509
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,924
<i>Didn't you miss him?</i>

510
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,426
<i>Terribly.</i>

511
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,470
But he wrote <i>to</i> me every day
and that helped keep me going.

512
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,515
<i>Except, every time the mail
came, I held my breath,</i>

513
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,435
<i>hoping he hadn't given them</i> an
<i>excuse to extend his</i> sentence

514
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,020
<i>or even kill him.</i>

515
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,897
Have the doctors told
you if you'll be able to walk

516
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,107
normally again?

517
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,401
Of course she'll be able
to walk normally again.

518
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,112
So you really didn't
think they'd let

519
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,322
Billy out of prison alive?

520
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,868
No, not even if they had to
shoot him

521
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,036
when he was going
through the gates on parole.

522
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,582
Bet you remember that day
when he got out.

523
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,084
I sure do.

524
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,130
It was the day we had

525
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,843
our first international seminar
on child abuse.

526
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,261
Child abuse?

527
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,431
Yeah,

528
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,600
the kids had done
an expose on child abuse,

529
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,062
child battering,

530
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:17,440
and how widespread
it is here in this country.

531
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,655
Pretty soon, we became
recognized

532
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,199
as one of the few places

533
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,289
that could successfully
help parents

534
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,042
who battered their children.

535
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,682
This is our one-to-one
type therapy.

536
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,227
Almost all of it is done
by lay therapists.

537
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,686
Our kids here at the school.

538
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,772
Was the boy born
without his hand?

539
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,525
No, his father cut it off
in a fit of rage.

540
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,860
It's a horrible history
of torture.

541
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,197
All of our professional staff
has pretty much given up on him.

542
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,451
Only Carol refuses to take no
for an answer.

543
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,536
You don't really think
she'll succeed?

544
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,371
You obviously
don't know Carol.

545
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,665
Okay, tough monkey.

546
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,835
Time to shower up
for the press.

547
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,100
Go ahead.

548
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,519
You're just a couple of hours
away from freedom.

549
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,772
Go ahead and give me one
of those fancy kicks.

550
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:43,318
Now, Indian buck, move out.

551
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,163
So in summary then, you're
saying to love those

552
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,665
that we find really despicable,
that we really can hate,

553
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,502
and I can really hate
these people that cut off

554
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,545
the fingers and beat
their children,

555
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,840
and somehow in the experience
of loving them,

556
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,635
they are going to change
before our eyes

557
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,345
and stop
beating their children.

558
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,263
That's it, exactly.

559
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,225
As you know, in a normal
parent-child relationship,

560
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,644
the parent is there to supply
the child's needs.

561
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,896
But, in the case
of the child abuser,

562
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,231
the parent is so desperate
for love,

563
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,984
he expects the child
to fulfill his needs.

564
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,112
Well, when the child can't do
it, or is incapable

565
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,197
or for whatever reason,

566
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,282
the parent ends up
beating him.

567
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,452
I'm sure some of you have
experienced this, say,

568
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,163
of some parents that have
watched their children

569
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,080
in little league?

570
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:41,001
We find that one child
usually becomes the scapegoat.

571
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,003
It's usually the child
most resembling the parent

572
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,254
doing the abusing.

573
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,298
You know, when you think
about it,

574
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,384
there are many, many kinds
of child abuse.

575
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,803
But it's only when it breaks
out in physical violence

576
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,222
that we recognize it
as something horrible.

577
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:59,223
Dr. Roberts, your complete
claim then is that by loving

578
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:00,937
these battering parents

579
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,522
instead of punishing
or confining them,

580
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,025
that that actually works
in stopping further beating

581
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,402
of their children.

582
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,070
Absolutely.

583
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,864
You're involved in child abuse,
and I'll bet you're using

584
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,241
some form of punishment,

585
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,785
threat, or maybe even jailing,
i don't know.

586
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,582
Now, you know your cure rate
is less than 25 percent.

587
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,417
Ours, on the other hand,
is over 90.

588
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,336
Dr. Roberts?

589
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,671
- I'm sorry.
- I beg your pardon.

590
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,255
Go ahead.

591
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:32,009
The whole fate
of the human race depends

592
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,011
upon our ability

593
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,763
to handle and recognize
normal aggression

594
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,266
and the hostility in us.

595
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,018
Now, have you thought
about applying this

596
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,854
to other areas of our society?

597
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,648
Yes, as an example,
this entire school here is

598
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,108
built upon the same principle.

599
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,194
And we would fervently like
to try it in other areas.

600
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,697
What Jean has really
taught us here

601
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,115
and in the child abuse center,

602
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,993
is that everyone has inside
of them a fantastic force,

603
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,080
and it can really change
people once it's unleashed.

604
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,541
So that's where the school
gets its pacifism?

605
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,962
I'm sorry, I just can't
stomach that word pacifism.

606
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,131
Because when people hear that
we're pacifists,

607
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,466
they automatically feel we're
sitting around waiting

608
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,220
and sometimes even retreating
from life, whereas we feel

609
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,140
the thing that we've got here
is a living, dynamic,

610
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,558
positive force

611
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,687
that has the ability to change
the most warped lives,

612
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,481
turn on the most confused
and lost people

613
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,108
and I think we all literally
feel here that it could

614
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,236
possibly rebuild the world.

615
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,780
Is this what you call
nonviolence?

616
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,240
No, I'm sorry.

617
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,993
We call it by something
much cornier than that.

618
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,537
We call it love.

619
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,127
- Can any of us go along?
- No.

620
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,558
Billy, there's a big press
contingent waiting

621
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,768
for you up in my office.

622
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,479
And I think it would be
a good idea for you and me

623
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,146
to get together

624
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,857
and talk about what we're
going to say.

625
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,401
That it?

626
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:18,783
Billy, it would be
to everyone's advantage

627
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,243
if you would cooperate
with warden cells.

628
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,297
He's a hard head.
He'll be back.

629
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:37,798
No way. They've already
got him marked.

630
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,638
You mean they'll kill him?

631
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,582
H'

632
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,897
he's coming.

633
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,232
He's coming.

634
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,609
He's coming.

635
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,741
You're not little Carol?

636
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,330
And sunshine?

637
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,436
Carol, could you come in here
a minute?

638
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,231
Billy.

639
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,442
Billy, Carol wrote a tune,
uh, especially for you

640
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,317
when you went away,

641
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,361
and I think we should hear it
about right now.

642
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,281
Why don't we all kind of be
quiet and listen.

643
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,770
Thank you.

644
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,800
Nope, I missed.

645
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,938
Mike?

646
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,655
Hai.

647
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,036
- Karate?
- Hapkido.

648
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,416
I know that, but what are
you doing in it?

649
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,876
What do you mean by that?

650
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,462
It's just funny, I'm sorry.

651
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,466
You're such a timid,
squeaky clean little mouse.

652
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,435
I thought you were
supposed to be

653
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,147
nonviolent, for god's sakes.

654
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,774
Even the Buddhist monks had
to learn something to keep

655
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,067
from being attacked.

656
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,611
Think about all those men
out there

657
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,904
who'd like to get her hands
on their sexy little body.

658
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,952
Think about all the men out
there who'd like to get

659
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,913
their hands
on her sexy little body.

660
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,998
Here, let me help you.

661
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,417
All I care about right now
is my own body.

662
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,627
My god, you broke my back.

663
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:58,464
Billy, I'd like you to meet
Mr. han from Korea.

664
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,883
A hapkido master here
in the United States.

665
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,510
How do you do.

666
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,804
I have had the honor
of hearing about your kicks

667
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,223
in Korea.

668
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,557
Thank you.

669
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,101
Is it true, do you really--

670
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,520
can you jump the spin kick?

671
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,650
After you.

672
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,161
Be my guest.

673
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,771
Just hold it, like that.

674
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,165
I haven't seen one of those
in a long time.

675
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,626
Would you like to try it?

676
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,175
After you.

677
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,986
Be my guest.

678
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,674
You and I and my master are
the only ones I know

679
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,424
who can do that.

680
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,345
Thank you very much.

681
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,889
Running deer and his two sons

682
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,181
have been lost
for almost a week

683
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,559
in that snow storm
up in the taos mountains.

684
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,519
Blue elk wants to know
if any of our skiers

685
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,355
or any of the kids
from the survival program

686
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,481
can go up and search.

687
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,982
How about the rescue patrol,
blue elk?

688
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,817
Have they been notified?

689
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,820
The highway patrol
and the ranger stations,

690
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,405
they don't give a damn
when Indians are involved.

691
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,199
At the rangers station all
they could tell us

692
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,742
is that he's probably
out drunk someplace

693
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,660
and they refused to help us.

694
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,245
Okay. I'll get the sheriff.

695
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,747
Carol, you go get
some of the kids

696
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,914
in their winter gear.

697
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,541
And tell them to dress warm
'cause it's a terrible

698
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,001
blizzard up there.

699
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,254
The family has been starving
for weeks.

700
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,258
The father and the two sons
went out after deer,

701
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,968
and they're probably lost
in that storm

702
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,135
up on independence Ridge.

703
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,013
See if you can get a chopper
into latigo canyon.

704
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,349
If not, try to get someone
to ski down the other side

705
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,642
of independence. Over.

706
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,565
There's no way I can
get it open.

707
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,734
0k3)!-

708
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,871
<i>uh, ground control,</i>

709
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,415
<i>ground control, over.</i>

710
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,083
<i>This is ground control. Over.</i>

711
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,543
<i>We're moving
down the south range</i>

712
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,547
<i>and will try to get in with
some ground equipment. Over.</i>

713
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,715
<i>Ground rescue is underway.</i>

714
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:31,385
<i>Team three, is there any way
you can get around the storm?</i>

715
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,637
<i>Try to come in east
of the taos divide?</i>

716
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,097
<i>This is air rescue four.</i>

717
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,141
<i>We're over the taos divide
right now.</i>

718
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,768
<i>It's just as socked in
up here.</i>

719
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,354
<i>Looks like it's moving south.
What about ski patrol? Over.</i>

720
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,814
<i>They're all over the place</i>

721
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,900
<i>but the blizzard's so bad on the
ground they can't even see.</i>

722
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,277
<i>Stand by.</i>

723
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,737
<i>Uh, this is chopper
seven, the only way you</i>

724
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,573
<i>would get down there is
to lift them up these ridges</i>

725
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,740
<i>and let them ski in. Over.</i>

726
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,409
<i>They're being
lifted now. Over.</i>

727
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,501
<i>Ground, this is
chopper seven.</i>

728
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,379
<i>We found two of them,
two boys. One's dead.</i>

729
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:11,132
<i>The other one's almost.
Alert central we're on the way.</i>

730
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,777
This is instrument four,
instrument four calling.

731
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,489
Can anybody read me?
Please somebody come over.

732
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,950
Somebody please, damn it,
come on in.

733
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,038
Rescue three, I've been
getting a weak signal

734
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,249
<i>that keeps fading in and cutting
out and it could be coming</i>

735
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,709
<i>from the other side
of these peaks.</i>

736
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,544
<i>Let's go have a look.</i>

737
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,048
Ls he alive?

738
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,925
Just barely, and I can't get
anybody on this thing.

739
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,178
No. You never will
with these peaks.

740
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,762
Can you get below this storm
down over on

741
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,889
independence Ridge?

742
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,557
I can try.

743
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,101
Go.

744
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,598
All right. Let's take this one
down to the morgue, huh?

745
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,225
Sheriff. I'm really sorry.

746
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,612
Why are you bringing him
in here?

747
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,156
That's what they told me
to do with him.

748
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,866
Well, he goes
down to city hospital.

749
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,576
Bundle him up good and go
with him in the ambulance.

750
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:01,910
Ambulance? Where are you
taking him?

751
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,953
- Down to the Indian hospital.
- Well, that will waste time.

752
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,205
Why not treat him here?

753
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,123
I wouldn't do it if I thought
it were dangerous.

754
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,584
You mean you can't even keep
an Indian here one or two days

755
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,128
in an emergency?

756
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,963
Look, I'm just an intern.

757
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,174
I don't make the rules.

758
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,634
Well, you're not
gonna move him.

759
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,261
He could lose a hand
or a foot.

760
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,929
- Well--
- tell me.

761
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,389
What would you do if he were
a white man and you

762
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,265
could treat him?

763
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,227
Well, I'd pack his extremities
and start him on some

764
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,686
vasodilator of ivs.

765
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:31,982
Show me.

766
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,818
You could be arrested
for making me do this.

767
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,694
You know that.

768
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:41,867
N ow.

769
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,416
What the hell
is going on here?

770
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,007
Vasodilator ivs for each one.

771
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,634
Come on, doctor. I'll take
the responsibility.

772
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,637
And bring those packs
over here and start applying

773
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:02,512
them to their lower legs

774
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,972
and I'll take the hands.

775
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,682
And raise them up.

776
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,726
Come on, doctor, move.

777
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,731
My client running deer wishes
to have it entered

778
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,440
into the record

779
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,192
that it is his position
that the Indian is a member

780
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,321
of the sovereign nation and is
not subject to the laws

781
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,781
of this land and this state.

782
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:25,494
And that therefore, this court
has no jurisdiction.

783
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:27,287
So entered.

784
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,206
Your honor, in so far as
the defendant

785
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,875
is still hospitalized,

786
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,502
and in addition has suffered
the severe personal hardship

787
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:38,131
of the loss of his oldest son,
the state petitions the court

788
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,509
for leniency and pleads
for a lesser sentence.

789
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,969
Hey, don't rip
your pants, buster.

790
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,639
In view
of the voluntary pleading

791
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,726
and the personal hardships
encountered,

792
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,646
the court reduces
the mandatory sentence

793
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,523
for trespassing and illegal
hunting of deer

794
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,193
from one year
minus a day in jail

795
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,737
to ten days
in the county jail.

796
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,116
Quiet. Quiet.

797
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,206
And a period of probation
to be not less than one year.

798
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,127
Bailiff. Bailiff.

799
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,759
Oh, lord.

800
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,970
Now what are they
being hassled for?

801
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,146
All right, Ken. Tell
headquarters that we don't

802
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,189
need any more help.

803
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,441
I demand to know what's
going on here.

804
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,151
Look, lady, mind
your own business.

805
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,402
Get back in your car.

806
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,404
This is my business.
These are my students,

807
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,446
now tell me what's going on.

808
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,323
Lady, they were disturbing
the peace, we got

809
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,241
a report of possession.

810
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,785
We're just checking it out.
Now, I suggest you stand back

811
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,829
or I will arrest you
for interference.

812
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,456
You just try it.

813
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,208
Hey, they can't search you
unless they've got a warrant.

814
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,919
All right, punk.
Move it out.

815
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,463
I've got every right to stand
here, I'm a citizen.

816
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,174
Well, so am I, punk,
now move it out.

817
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,561
They have no right to search
you without a warrant.

818
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,522
Tell them so, out loud, and
they'll be in contempt of court.

819
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:39,335
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

820
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,837
It's your choice, lady.

821
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,965
You can do as you're told
or get your head split open.

822
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,258
Listen, buster, you're not
gonna feel me up.

823
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,594
I'll search you right here,
or in the paddy wagon.

824
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,928
It's your choice.

825
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,264
Jim, you're out of line,
now knock it off.

826
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,725
Well, my dear.

827
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,478
You can feel me up right here,
in the bus or the lawn.

828
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,231
Anywhere you want to do it.

829
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,321
Well, can't win them all.

830
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,926
All right, folks. Move it.

831
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,014
We aren't gonna ask
you again, now move it.

832
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,902
Okay alley lawyer.

833
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,322
You can go now.

834
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,115
Unless you've got
something else to say.

835
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,493
Hey, we've got
a tough monkey here.

836
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,997
Feels he don't have to
move off like the others.

837
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,833
Okay, mister.

838
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,168
You were ordered to disperse.

839
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,045
And that means now.

840
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,389
Somebody else need a lesson?

841
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,683
Yeah, our tough monkey here.

842
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,852
Say, isn't that--

843
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,122
we're gonna have to shoot him.

844
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,920
Too big a mess.

845
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,309
Billy, you heard
what the sheriff said.

846
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,269
You just can't keep
doing this.

847
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,937
Well, what would you rather
i did, then?

848
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,357
Let them club him to death?

849
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:08,443
Under alienation and
guardianship the government

850
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,822
has the right to sell,
trade or give away

851
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,908
all the Indian land
to whomever it pleases.

852
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,492
Yeah.

853
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,661
Which are usually
their friends who put

854
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,663
up campaign funds.

855
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,461
And under guardianship they
control our water,

856
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,380
they control our plumbing,
they control our worship,

857
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,467
they control our land
and they control our money.

858
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,969
They control every damn thing
in our lives.

859
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,264
Mr. strump.

860
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:42,477
As our agent, we want to know
what you going to do.

861
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,812
What the congress declared

862
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:49,234
was a bill giving you
self-determination.

863
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,277
Hah! Congress is a bunch

864
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:53,571
of filthy rotten,
lying thieves.

865
00:58:56,074 --> 00:59:00,036
And to get some industry
in here by either leasing

866
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,163
or selling this land

867
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:04,499
which isn't worth a damn
to anybody anyway.

868
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,877
If it isn't worth a damn,
why the hell

869
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,838
are all these oil companies

870
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,338
and mining interests so eager
to get their hands on it?

871
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,721
We'd like to know,
agent strump. Tell us.

872
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,390
Yellow hawk, give us those
statistics which show

873
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,100
how many jobs will be
provided for

874
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,352
here on the reservation
by these people.

875
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,354
That's not yellow hawk.

876
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,938
That's little uncle
Tommy hawk.

877
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,650
He's what crazy horse called
a loaf around the fort.

878
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,736
He's a bought and paid apple
and you know it.

879
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,488
It happens every time
you radical activists

880
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:36,198
come in here.

881
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:39,534
You tear up everything
and then you skip out.

882
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,953
And it's the children
and those of us that are

883
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,913
left behind that have to stay
and take the beating.

884
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,585
My father was
a tribal chairman.

885
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,879
And my grandfather was a man
of medicine for many years.

886
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,047
And I'm an activist.

887
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,924
He doesn't mean you, blue elk.

888
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,551
- He means me.
- And me.

889
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,344
And in a sense he's right.

890
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,722
They do have to put up
with pressure every day.

891
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,432
- They control our--
- how's it going?

892
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,392
Not very good, I'm afraid.

893
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,935
And you know who
the trustee is.

894
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,313
It's posner's
first national bank.

895
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,565
In this state.

896
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,901
And he's got $80 million
of Indian money in his trust.

897
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:17,030
I thought we were here
to discuss running deer.

898
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:20,074
To get the tribal permission
to use him as a test case

899
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,786
for international law
before the world court.

900
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:26,414
We've got names, we've got
dates and exact amounts,

901
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:30,292
and we're going to bring it
out in international court.

902
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,462
A person could get killed
with foolish talk like that.

903
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,090
Many of us already have been.

904
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,300
Because if they can't
buy us out

905
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,927
with scholarships and grants,
they kill us.

906
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:42,221
Yeah.

907
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,269
Well, what happened?

908
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:51,106
They voted it down.

909
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,982
And that damned yellow hawk
will probably get

910
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,110
a personal invitation
to the white house for that.

911
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,820
I don't understand.

912
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,030
How in the world do they keep
him in line so?

913
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,615
They caught him embezzling
funds and the white house

914
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,410
promised to hush it up
if he'd cooperate.

915
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,371
You know, the same old story.

916
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,414
Why don't you guys take
running deer's case

917
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,625
to world court
just by yourselves?

918
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,084
I mean, you don't
have to bother

919
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,504
with all these committee
and tribal decision things.

920
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,672
Well, that just divides us
by having Indian

921
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,550
fighting Indian.
You know, divide and conquer.

922
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:21,803
That's the way that they've
always beaten us.

923
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,554
Now, that's your whole problem
right there.

924
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,390
- Hmm?
- What?

925
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,352
You got all chiefs
and no Indians.

926
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,104
That is so bad.

927
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,190
I can't even believe it.

928
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,526
That is really poor.
That is really bad.

929
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,074
If it's illegal for an Indian
to go out and hunt deer,

930
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,534
how come it's all of a sudden
legal for you and your bunch?

931
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,079
Because it's deer hunting
season, and we've all

932
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,081
got our licenses. That's why.

933
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,333
Not on Indian land it isn't.

934
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,376
Not for you anyway.

935
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,668
It's still illegal.

936
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:58,089
Carl, this is no longer
Indian reservation land.

937
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,715
It's all been terminated.

938
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,843
The Indians won't accept that.

939
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,594
Besides, this land's
sacred to them.

940
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,721
There'll be trouble.

941
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,223
We do this every year, Carl.
You know that.

942
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,851
Yeah, but you don't lock up a
starving Indian every year.

943
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,602
Tempers are still pretty hot
over that one.

944
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:15,106
Carl, on this bus we've got
corporation presidents,

945
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:18,526
Pentagon officials,
Washington politicians,

946
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,569
and even
the lieutenant governor.

947
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,863
You big ignorant pig.

948
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,533
- Who you calling a pig?
- I'm calling you a pig.

949
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,369
With all of those big wheels
back there, do you expect

950
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,498
me to go say,
"sorry, we gotta all go home"?

951
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,423
Order.

952
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,095
Order, order! Order!

953
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,764
Crazy drunks.

954
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,557
Shooting at anything
that moves.

955
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,433
Our women and children
are afraid to move

956
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,060
out of their homes for water.

957
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:55,396
Yeah!

958
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,565
Who is it they're shooting?
What are you talking about?

959
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,900
Running deer couldn't even
kill a deer and feed

960
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,485
his starving family.

961
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,279
Right!

962
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,698
Indians have to go hungry.

963
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:09,077
But these trophy hunters,
they come in here and they do

964
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,578
as they damn please.

965
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,373
And kill all the deer
they want.

966
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:16,250
Yeah!

967
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,211
All right.

968
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,379
The question is, what are we
going to do about it.

969
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,714
Let's run them out.

970
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,594
I think we should take
some cameras and go down

971
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,762
and take some pictures
of them and their call girls

972
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,015
in the nude and turn them
in to the newspaper.

973
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:34,519
Hey. Better than that,
better than that.

974
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,437
Let's send them
to their wives.

975
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:39,274
--Got a right to hunt
on Indian land.

976
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,362
That's what the law students
were trying to tell you before.

977
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,572
That's no longer Indian land.

978
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,284
That's part of the reservation
that they've been quietly

979
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:51,577
terminating for our own good.

980
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:56,040
Not to me it isn't.

981
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,876
What is that supposed to mean?

982
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,961
I never voted for termination.

983
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:03,089
Did anybody in this room
ever vote for termination?

984
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,716
No!

985
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,260
Do you know
of any tribal member

986
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,553
who knowingly voted
for termination?

987
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,514
No!

988
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:14,768
Then to me they're still
illegally on Indian land

989
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,479
and this tribal council has
the authority to arrest them

990
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:18,771
and drive them out.

991
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,609
What do you mean, arrest them?

992
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:23,776
Who's gonna do it?

993
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,362
I will. The tribal police.

994
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:30,074
Or anyone in this room who is
man enough to go with me.

995
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,785
Or tell me something.

996
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,245
Are you afraid to stand up to
the white man even when he's

997
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,247
shooting at your wives
and your children?

998
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,915
No!

999
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:44,297
Me and my rifle can be
any place you say

1000
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,590
within half an hour.

1001
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,638
Now, they're calling
this the international

1002
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,098
symposium on the law.

1003
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,559
And the American Indian
legal rights--

1004
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,852
and let me tell
you guys something.

1005
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,647
The real purpose of this is to
make it look like everybody's

1006
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,940
stealing from the Indians.

1007
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,442
Oh, come on, posner.

1008
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,945
I've handled dozens of land
sales of Indians and even I

1009
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:10,615
don't know what
termination is. Do you?

1010
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:14,285
Look, these radical Indians are
taking payoffs on all sides.

1011
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,121
Who cares? As long as they
don't terminate my lease.

1012
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,791
I've only got 92 more years
for it to run.

1013
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,211
Well, you sure as hell better
hope that conference

1014
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,463
never takes place.

1015
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:28,340
Because if it does, we're all
in for a lot of surprises.

1016
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:20,810
I order you to drop your guns.

1017
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,029
You sentence our brother
running deer to jail

1018
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:35,033
for killing a deer to feed
his starving children,

1019
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:38,703
and yet you dare to come here
and do this?

1020
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,790
What, do you call this sport?

1021
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,209
I was wrong.

1022
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:47,712
I'll correct that injustice
to the Indian.

1023
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:48,629
Well, tell me.

1024
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,839
Just how are you
going to do that?

1025
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:53,342
He's already spent ten days
rotting in your lousy jail

1026
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,552
like a caged animal.

1027
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,346
I'll give running deer a job.
A good job.

1028
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:00,058
More money than he could
possibly earn.

1029
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,476
Because he's an Indian?

1030
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,602
And you've got one pay scale
for your whites and one

1031
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:04,937
for your Indians?

1032
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:08,066
Aw, come on, now.
Don't be childish.

1033
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,567
All of you.

1034
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:13,237
You are all illegally
trespassing on Indian land

1035
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,407
and you are all going to be
tried by us.

1036
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,492
Here and now.

1037
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:21,662
If this is a tribal decision,

1038
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,956
where is yellow hawk
and little bear?

1039
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,834
Probably back home
sucking up your spit.

1040
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:27,793
Billy.

1041
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,756
I'm lieutenant governor Barnes.

1042
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,092
This is George shipley.

1043
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:38,429
He's the president
of stonehearst mining company.

1044
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,097
This isn't Indian land.

1045
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:43,768
After it was terminated we
purchased a leasehold on it.

1046
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,770
My company holds
the rights to it

1047
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,438
and these men are here
as my guests.

1048
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,065
How many days
after the president

1049
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,818
signed that termination bill

1050
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,402
did your company get
your leasehold?

1051
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,196
Oh, I can't, I can't remember.

1052
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,781
I don't see that has
any bearing.

1053
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,200
How many days?

1054
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,786
The day after termination
was signed.

1055
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,122
And how much money did you
just happen to contribute

1056
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,833
to the secret campaign fund?

1057
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:12,129
$125,000.

1058
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,050
What did you say
your name was?

1059
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,677
My name is George shipley.

1060
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:21,013
I'm President of the
stonehearst mining company.

1061
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,060
You know, shipley, I think
I'll just kill you

1062
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,603
right where you stand.

1063
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,485
We've made a terrible
mistake and you've

1064
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,111
got the upper hand for now.

1065
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:39,532
Take advantage of it and all
you'll do is fan the flames

1066
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,699
of hatred higher.

1067
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:46,409
And then later on, all of us
here, somehow, we'll get even.

1068
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,501
Trying us isn't going
to solve anything.

1069
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:53,045
Blue elk?
Rolling thunder?

1070
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,841
I know we don't think much of
each other, but we're realists.

1071
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,260
Now, what the lieutenant
governor has to say is true.

1072
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,471
You may feel good now,
but you're gonna suffer later.

1073
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,684
All right.

1074
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,395
We'll not try you now.

1075
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,856
We'll just take a good clean
picture of each and every one

1076
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,316
of you for future reference.

1077
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,694
Okay. You heard him.

1078
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,737
I want two lines here.

1079
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,031
Women to the front and men
to the rear.

1080
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:24,702
And I want all the men to take
off them hats. Now.

1081
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,454
Oh, you've really gone too far
this time, Billy.

1082
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:30,082
You're making a terrible mistake
photographing those men.

1083
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,543
You know, the last time one of
you posners uttered

1084
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,711
that lousy cliche,
one of you got killed.

1085
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,255
Now tell me, don't you
ever learn?

1086
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,632
You people back there.
That means you too.

1087
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:39,717
Let's go.

1088
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,969
And I'll swear to god you're
really gonna pay for this one.

1089
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,721
Take that hat off.
I'm talking to you.

1090
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,224
Jean, how much more is gonna
have to happen before you

1091
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:50,353
get those kids to pull back
on those exposes?

1092
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:54,106
Taking pictures of those people
just infuriated them.

1093
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,734
It made matters much worse.

1094
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,402
I know that, Carl.

1095
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,405
But I can't tell the kids on
one hand I have

1096
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:03,449
complete confidence that they
can govern themselves and then

1097
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,576
on the other hand take it away
when there's an important

1098
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,410
decision to be made.

1099
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,455
Either you decide to trust them
on the vital decisions,

1100
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,081
or you don't.
It's as simple as that.

1101
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:13,250
Yes, but you can speak out,
can't you?

1102
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,253
I mean get up and present
your point of view.

1103
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,797
I don't see why you can't
argue against something

1104
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,007
you think is bad
or destructive.

1105
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,967
As long as the kids have
the right to vote it down

1106
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,260
if they don't agree with you.

1107
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,512
Yeah, I know.

1108
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:27,139
But oftentimes kids have
a tendency to hero worship

1109
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,600
and I just think if Billy
or I got up and argued a point

1110
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,602
some of these kids
would just blindly follow

1111
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,604
because they identify
with us so much.

1112
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:36,273
And I'm sorry, I just don't
think that's fair.

1113
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:39,151
What you're saying then is that
when you get right down to it,

1114
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,945
you don't really believe they're
adult enough to make

1115
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,571
their own decisions.

1116
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,369
Grandfather,
i would be honored

1117
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,787
if you would teach me

1118
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,623
how to Pierce the veil
and go to that other world

1119
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:55,751
and make my own inward journey
to find my own center.

1120
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:03,630
I would be honored, grandfather,
if you would teach me the way.

1121
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:09,849
You have many enemies in this
world waiting to destroy you.

1122
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,309
If you are to survive,

1123
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:16,147
you will have to find peace
in yourself first.

1124
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,649
That is why I want to make
the inward journey.

1125
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,237
The inward journey
is dangerous.

1126
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,697
Filled with terrifying evil.

1127
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,492
There are many demons
of great power.

1128
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,287
It takes much wisdom to
learn that they are

1129
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,830
of your own making.

1130
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,166
And first, you must learn
to see your own shadow.

1131
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:39,086
How will I learn to see
my shadow, grandfather?

1132
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:43,257
Many cannot survive
the dangerous inward journey.

1133
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:47,010
But if you do, in time
you will come face to face

1134
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,013
with your own shadow.

1135
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,807
Then you will know
what I mean.

1136
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,485
I think I see it, grandfather.

1137
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:10,243
Yes, I see it clearly now.

1138
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,869
What color is it?

1139
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,835
Blue. Bright blue.

1140
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:28,468
That is a spirit looking
to see if you are worthy.

1141
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:31,221
It takes many forms.

1142
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,806
Where did it go?

1143
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:40,397
When you can tell me
where the flame comes from,

1144
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:44,276
I will tell you where it goes
when it goes out.

1145
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:02,586
Grandfather, where will I look
for my shadow demon?

1146
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:05,172
We think the spirits
live out there

1147
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:08,091
but they and the shadow
demon live inside you.

1148
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,637
He is all the evil in you
that others can see in you

1149
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,305
but you cannot.

1150
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,974
Why is that?

1151
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:18,143
We all put forth an image that
we want other people

1152
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,480
to think we are and that we'd
like to think we are,

1153
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,107
but we all have the secret evil
side that is

1154
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,943
painful to discover,

1155
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,695
though others
can see it in us very easily.

1156
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:31,949
How can I come to know
my evil side, grandfather?

1157
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:35,619
By the things in others
that make you angry.

1158
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:39,123
Whenever you get upset
at someone or something,

1159
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:42,126
it's because that quality that
you're upset about

1160
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,961
really exists in you.

1161
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:48,173
It is always easier to see
the evil in someone else

1162
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:51,010
and by trying to change him,
think you are getting rid

1163
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,221
of your own evil,
your own shadow.

1164
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:58,642
It takes superhuman courage
to see that this fault

1165
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,478
really exists in you.

1166
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:04,148
That what you're really hating
and trying to change

1167
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,859
is a quality of yourself.

1168
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:10,488
Like the rugged man who hates
long-haired youth.

1169
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,991
Underneath, he is secretly
afraid of his own femininity.

1170
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:18,161
Grandfather, may I now descend
to the cave of the dead?

1171
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:21,165
No, you are not yet ready.

1172
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:23,500
First, you must seek
your own vision.

1173
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:26,879
When your heart is open,
your vision will come.

1174
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:30,173
And only after you've received
your vision will you have

1175
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:34,386
some chance to survive
in the cave of the dead.

1176
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,189
Hello, blue elk.

1177
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,357
How long has Billy gone
without food and water?

1178
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,026
Seven days now.

1179
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,861
And on the eighth,
if he's worthy of it,

1180
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:51,862
his vision will come.

1181
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,864
But if a woman enters
these sacred grounds

1182
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:55,282
the medicine is lost.

1183
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,367
You'll have to go back,
I'm sorry.

1184
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:58,577
What are you guys gonna do when

1185
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,036
the women's lib
hears about this?

1186
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,080
You'll have to take that
up with the spirits.

1187
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,350
Come, Billy Jack. Come.

1188
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,727
For I am going to show you

1189
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,896
the true nature
of the white man

1190
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,439
through all of history.

1191
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,526
Come and look with me
over this river of time.

1192
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,360
Look out.

1193
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,572
There's St. augustine,

1194
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:39,743
preaching the Christian creed
of love to the druid britons,

1195
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:43,247
with the tips of their lances
dripping with blood.

1196
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:47,793
Oh, and there's king Richard
the lionhearted,

1197
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,338
slaughtering the heathen until
they convert to christianity.

1198
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:55,801
Here you see the lie of that
old romanticism you were taught

1199
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,677
about the crusades as a boy.

1200
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,890
See how they butcher everyone
in this village of Jews

1201
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,976
in the name of god and love?

1202
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:11,396
And remember that great brave
Indian fighter, kit Carson?

1203
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,901
Well, he had rounded up
over 400 navajo women,

1204
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:22,453
children and babies
into this cave,

1205
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:25,747
and his men bravely
and methodically

1206
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,291
shot them to death.

1207
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:32,253
What the white man calls
the spread of civilization,

1208
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:37,630
his christianity, and so-called
democracy have a secret shadow.

1209
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,680
Greed and power.

1210
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,226
Look well into your own heart,
my brother.

1211
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:50,981
See how much of your violence
comes from the same lust

1212
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,983
for power over other people.

1213
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,195
<i>We've got names, we've got
dates and exact amounts</i>

1214
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,990
<i>and we're going to bring it
out in international court.</i>

1215
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:03,868
<i>A person could get killed
with foolish talk like that.</i>

1216
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:07,247
<i>A person could get killed
with foolish talk like that.</i>

1217
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,708
No!

1218
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,855
That worked pretty well.

1219
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,691
Which one do you think
goes next?

1220
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,194
Come on, try it.

1221
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,157
Let's try this one and see
what happens.

1222
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,953
No good sons of bitches.

1223
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,538
Oh my god.

1224
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:51,166
I don't know where she gets
the Patience.

1225
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,045
You've gotta remember,
Carol, Danny has been

1226
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:58,465
in over 20 foster homes,
and he was even

1227
01:17:58,465 --> 01:17:59,466
put in solitary confinement

1228
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:02,385
in one of the detention homes
when he was 4 years old.

1229
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:05,972
He's never known anything but
brutality and rejection.

1230
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,766
I understand all that.

1231
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,392
But what can I do about it?

1232
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,895
Every single expert
told me he's hopeless.

1233
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:14,273
Honey, we can keep loving him
and loving him no matter

1234
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,482
what he does.

1235
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:17,609
But you've got to remember
he's going to have a hard time

1236
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:20,112
accepting that love
because he's gonna be afraid

1237
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,947
that it will be torn away like
everything else in his life.

1238
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,075
Because he's convinced
he's so evil.

1239
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:27,619
So we just can never never
get mad at him

1240
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,247
and more important we just
cannot give up loving him.

1241
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,915
Oh, I'm not going to give up.

1242
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,459
But what I want to know is,

1243
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,586
while we're doing
all this loving,

1244
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,254
who's supposed to be
loving us?

1245
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:38,588
I'll love you, honey.

1246
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:44,011
This school has no legal right
to detain the child.

1247
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,430
Now, if we have to find Danny's
parents and get them

1248
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:50,100
to regain custody we will,
and if that doesn't work,

1249
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,143
we'll have him committed
to a mental hospital.

1250
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,104
You'll do what?

1251
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:57,774
Any attempt by your group, or
posner's group, or any other

1252
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,944
makes to attack this school
through this child will be met

1253
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:02,821
by the finest lawyers
and the most widespread

1254
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,280
publicity that money can buy.

1255
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,491
You're just trying to get
back at us because we've

1256
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,036
exposed the filthy conditions
of your state hospitals.

1257
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:10,746
Why don't you go and clean them
up so they're fit

1258
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:11,788
for human beings?

1259
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,707
- You do that.
- We have evidence the child is

1260
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:17,794
unhappy here, and is constantly
going into fits of rage.

1261
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,130
Mister, you are so stupid
it's unreal.

1262
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,799
Harry. Harry, this
is not constructive.

1263
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,968
Now, it's clear that Jean is not
going to give up the child

1264
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:28,555
without a legal battle, so if
you want to see it through

1265
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,557
you're just going to have
to take her to court.

1266
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,225
Fair enough. It shouldn't be
too difficult to prove

1267
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,435
that this environment

1268
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,688
is too radical an environment
to bring up a young child in.

1269
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:40,317
What you men are really saying
is this constant harassment

1270
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,068
and this bugging
of our telephones,

1271
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,321
it will all magically stop
if we decide to give up

1272
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,363
the Indian rights seminar.

1273
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:47,491
Oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry.

1274
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,160
I haven't any idea
what you're talking about.

1275
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,078
But I'm sure your phones
aren't tapped.

1276
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,332
That's illegal
without a court order.

1277
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,875
Would you go get bugger
and tell him to bring

1278
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,167
the machine in here, please?

1279
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,503
So you can just go back
and tell whoever sent you

1280
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:02,339
that they can just stop
bugging our phones

1281
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,883
because we can knock out
their bug anytime we want to.

1282
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,051
Is this phone
now being tapped?

1283
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,512
Oh, yes. With an infinity type

1284
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:12,182
that is picking up everything
being said in this room

1285
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:16,352
from this phone without you even
lifting up the phone receiver.

1286
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,563
So, whenever we want to talk
without anyone else

1287
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:21,149
listening in, we just
call on bugger.

1288
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,317
Bugger, hit the switch.

1289
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:27,030
You didn't turn
this thing off, did you?

1290
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,741
- Turn off what?
- I don't know, it's weird.

1291
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:31,618
It's gone blank,
i can't hear anything.

1292
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:35,705
Well, check your relays.

1293
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:38,542
Mr. posner, allegations have
been made that the

1294
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,795
$80 million trust that was given
to you by the Indian bureau

1295
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,715
for the land sale was turned
over to you as trustee,

1296
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:47,384
instead of the bank
in Wyoming, and this is

1297
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:50,387
because of your heavy campaign
contributions in Washington.

1298
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,430
Look, that's ridiculous.

1299
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:55,392
I'm not even aware
of what campaign contributions

1300
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,268
my executive committee
decides to make.

1301
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,062
But I do know

1302
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:01,565
that they are made
on a strictly impartial basis.

1303
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:04,067
You mean you have no friends
at all in Washington?

1304
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,486
I mean, there isn't anybody
up there--

1305
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:06,403
well, certainly i--

1306
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,238
or any heavy campaign
contributions?

1307
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:11,783
Certainly I have friends
in Washington. Don't you?

1308
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:14,578
Now, what can I do
for you, Princess?

1309
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,250
Aren't you responsible
for helping eisenhower

1310
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,459
back in the '50s

1311
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,254
effect the transfer
of Indian trust money

1312
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,923
to local banks here and
throughout the state

1313
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:30,302
so that you could, uh, invest it
at a great personal profit?

1314
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:34,306
Ah, well, that was quite
a long time ago but no, no,

1315
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,099
that's not true.
Absolutely not.

1316
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,936
What does it say?
What does it say?

1317
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:41,271
Basically, it says the man
is lying through his teeth.

1318
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:48,236
What's that ticking?

1319
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:54,784
I'm picking up a strange ticking
sound from the transmitter.

1320
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:57,496
What's it sound like?

1321
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:23,813
The governor's putting
the town under martial law.

1322
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:27,818
The town? Why the hell isn't he
out here protecting the school?

1323
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:30,821
Something about fearing the kids
coming in and retaliating.

1324
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:34,616
Oh, bull. That jackass would do
anything for publicity.

1325
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:41,327
Well, as long as the laws
work one way for the rich

1326
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:43,333
and one way
for the rest of us,

1327
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,501
looks like there's only one
thing left for us to do.

1328
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,712
Go in at nighttime and bomb
the hell out of them.

1329
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,843
The police won't help us,
we know that.

1330
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:54,678
And we also know that our
nonviolence

1331
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,012
just gets us stomped on.

1332
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:59,182
The only thing those racist pigs
will ever understand is terror.

1333
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,101
Wait a minute, Jocelyn.

1334
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,520
Why don't you quit using race
as an excuse

1335
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,188
for your own neurosis.

1336
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:08,025
I don't think
all these marches and protests

1337
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,402
and demonstrations
accomplish anything.

1338
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:13,029
Oh yeah, well, look
at wounded knee.

1339
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,032
Well, look at wounded knee.
What was accomplished?

1340
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:15,657
Plenty.

1341
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,241
Frightened middle-class
people who see

1342
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,702
things changing so fast
around them, just when they are

1343
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,788
becoming humane and beginning
to see

1344
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:23,372
that there is an injustice,

1345
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:25,917
they see violent demonstrations
and flee like hell right back

1346
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,879
to where the politicians
want them.

1347
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:32,257
She's exactly right.

1348
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:33,633
She's exactly right.

1349
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:35,552
Why don't we come up with
something different?

1350
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,720
Something that we really want
to show the people in town

1351
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,389
we're not monsters
and we don't go around

1352
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:40,973
clubbing people
and throwing bombs.

1353
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,725
Michelle, come on.

1354
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,561
King tried that approach and
tell me where is he today?

1355
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:47,230
Oh, come on. Come on.

1356
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:48,941
That's beside the point
and you know it.

1357
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,109
The hell it is.
I'm right on the point.

1358
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:53,569
Where's everything he's done,
or anybody else for that matter?

1359
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:57,073
They blew it off like they
blew off his head.

1360
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,159
To go in and bomb now is not
acting,

1361
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,910
it's reacting
to what they've done to us.

1362
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,621
And the guy who's making
you react

1363
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,247
is in fact controlling you.

1364
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:06,750
I agree with Michelle.
Instead of reacting to them,

1365
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:11,087
why don't we just once go in
and do what's good for us?

1366
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:13,423
I'd like to add something
to that if I might.

1367
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:15,591
Would you like to come up here
and speak, Jean?

1368
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:20,092
Come on.

1369
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,975
I thought we were supposed
to make our own decisions.

1370
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,021
Come on. All this ruckus isn't
getting you anywhere.

1371
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,023
But doesn't she have a say so
just like you do

1372
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,441
and she and she and she?

1373
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,527
Yeah, say so, say so, but she
knows she's gonna get up,

1374
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:36,988
and make a speech that
everybody

1375
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,448
in this room is going
to follow blindly.

1376
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:40,950
That's right.

1377
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:52,461
I don't gotta tell you.
Now, look, either we decide

1378
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,630
or big mama over there
decides for us.

1379
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,966
Joanne. Joanne.

1380
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:58,843
Big mama doesn't want
to tell you what to do,

1381
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:01,471
she just has some thoughts
she'd like to give.

1382
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:06,685
It's a crisis right now

1383
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:08,478
and you're trying to tell
us what to do?

1384
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:11,981
That violates everything that
you've taught us to believe.

1385
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:18,155
Here we go again.
Here we go again.

1386
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,334
Well, it's about time.

1387
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:33,545
My god, at least someone's
got common sense.

1388
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,837
What do you mean?

1389
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,423
Stopping these riots
before they start.

1390
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:40,260
Thank god at least we've got
a governor with guts.

1391
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,095
Aw, come on, blue elk.

1392
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,013
We came all the way up here
just to see Billy.

1393
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:45,432
Well, I can't help that.

1394
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:46,850
You can't see him now.

1395
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,852
This is a gathering
of medicine men.

1396
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:51,187
Some of them are using
smoke from religious herbs

1397
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:52,814
and others are purifying
themselves

1398
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,357
for Billy's sacred journey.

1399
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,942
This whole mountain is closed.

1400
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,194
You mean they purify
themselves just to take drugs?

1401
01:25:58,195 --> 01:25:59,863
No, no, only some do.

1402
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:01,531
And for them the smoke
of the medicine

1403
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:02,865
is a divine spirit.

1404
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,826
If one is not totally prepared
to meet him,

1405
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,577
if one has not fasted,

1406
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:10,373
or purified oneself thoroughly,
or if outsiders interfere,

1407
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:13,377
the spirit would be angry
and make Billy sick,

1408
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:15,212
or even take him away.

1409
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:16,713
Like when a kid is spaced?

1410
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,881
- Off in stony land?
- No, no.

1411
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,217
You people don't know anything
about the other world

1412
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:24,387
or about the power that can
so easily kill you.

1413
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:25,680
So when like fools
you take drugs

1414
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:29,059
for kicks or to get high,
you run a great danger.

1415
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:31,478
And when something happens,
all you can talk about

1416
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:34,063
is mental illness, or you
describe it as suicide.

1417
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:35,231
Come on, blue elk.

1418
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,900
We know all that.
But when can we see him?

1419
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,902
Tomorrow morning. Maybe.

1420
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:41,070
But you're going to have to wait
half way down the mountain.

1421
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:43,031
- Now leave.
- All right, you guys. Come on.

1422
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:12,936
You are going to descend
to the cave of the dead,

1423
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,104
where our people
were massacred.

1424
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:19,025
Be very careful, because there
are many spirits there

1425
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,110
who would like to take
you with them.

1426
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:24,447
And others who do not want
to pass on to the next world,

1427
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:28,118
so they would like to enter
and possess your body.

1428
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:31,496
The souls of these dead wreak
for vengeance

1429
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,998
and they will
know your heart.

1430
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:37,877
If it is that of a white man,
you will not survive.

1431
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:39,629
I am ready, grandfather.

1432
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,547
There will be demons also.

1433
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:45,802
If you show any fear,
they will tear you to pieces

1434
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:49,180
and the ghosts will possess
your soul.

1435
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:52,642
If you show you are not afraid
no matter what they do,

1436
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:55,227
the demons will stop
terrifying you

1437
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:59,148
and become your friends.
Are you afraid?

1438
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:01,025
You once taught
me that courage

1439
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,153
is not the absence of fear,

1440
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:06,406
grandfather, but the conquest
of it. I am ready.

1441
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:10,159
Beware most of all
the red-eyed demon.

1442
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,662
By his screams
you will know him.

1443
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:15,331
He is the most powerful
of all the demons

1444
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:19,336
and because you will do
much good if you survive,

1445
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:23,506
he will kill you on the spot
if you show any fear.

1446
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:25,008
Good luck.

1447
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:54,037
No cobras live
in this country, my friend.

1448
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,538
I know who you are
and I'm afraid

1449
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:57,791
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

1450
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,334
I've got to go
down the tunnel.

1451
01:32:57,781 --> 01:32:59,324
You're me.

1452
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:03,328
I am loweklow.
Your inner self.

1453
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:10,001
Someday, when you fully accept
your fate and your death,

1454
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:13,212
then you will have me
as your inner guide,

1455
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:16,466
but for now, you are to go
to the desert

1456
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:18,801
and learn from the maiden.

1457
01:33:18,802 --> 01:33:22,180
I'm sorry,
i just can't understand

1458
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,806
all that's happening here.

1459
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:25,475
But that's your trouble.

1460
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:27,393
You always try to think
and understand

1461
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:28,894
everything with your head

1462
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:31,647
instead of just feeling it
with your heart.

1463
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:36,110
Now go and just experience
what the maiden offers you.

1464
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:45,119
Billy Jack, over here.

1465
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:50,833
Now who are you?

1466
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:53,336
And where are we?

1467
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:57,506
I am here to show you the way
to the house of the great one.

1468
01:33:57,507 --> 01:34:00,343
But first you must prove
yourself generous of heart.

1469
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:03,012
All right. I'm ready.

1470
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:05,848
Go and slap him in the face

1471
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:08,518
and no matter what he does,
do not strike back.

1472
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,730
And no matter what he does,
I'm not to hit him back?

1473
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:16,358
That's right.

1474
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:21,030
Run, get going, run there.

1475
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:25,409
Go, go.

1476
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,037
I've got a little bet.

1477
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:30,039
No way.

1478
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:48,891
I don't think you're going
to particularly like this.

1479
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,854
Why, you stupid son of a--

1480
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:03,948
that man was
on the lowest level

1481
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,575
and reacts only
with animal instinct.

1482
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:07,994
Treated with violence,

1483
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:11,288
he was immediately pulled down
to the violent animal level.

1484
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,457
No better than the man
that hit him.

1485
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:16,294
And so he ends up being
controlled by the animal

1486
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,879
in the man who hit him.

1487
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,797
Hit another.

1488
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:21,381
War of honor is something
that went out

1489
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:22,633
in the middle ages.

1490
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:26,095
War today is nothing but
economic gain, economic gain

1491
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:29,139
for a few individuals
in this country who control

1492
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:32,852
the top, top companies
in this country.

1493
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:36,272
These companies go all the way
to soft drink manufacturers,

1494
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,816
all the way
to prepackaged foods.

1495
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:40,776
Excuse me a moment.

1496
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:43,029
This is gonna seem as stupid
to you probably

1497
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:44,655
as it does to me, but--

1498
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:07,553
he was on the second level.

1499
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:10,973
He could not be pulled down
to the level of the brute beast

1500
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:13,476
acting on physical violence,

1501
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:16,228
but was easily pulled
away from what he was doing

1502
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:18,064
and lost control
of his own center.

1503
01:36:18,064 --> 01:36:20,399
So he too did not own
his own soul,

1504
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,403
but could quickly be
controlled by another.

1505
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:25,154
Once again.

1506
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:40,461
Forgive me, I have no idea
why I am doing this.

1507
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,344
I feel sorry for you.

1508
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:50,012
Only a child thinks that being
a man

1509
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:52,098
is being tough and violent.

1510
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,266
Someday you may learn
that being a man has to do

1511
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:55,977
with self-discipline over
one's time

1512
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:59,480
and one's emotion with a deep
and...

1513
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,858
Compassionate understanding
for other people's feelings.

1514
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,834
This man has reached
the third level

1515
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,877
where he is his own person,

1516
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:23,963
so that no man can
force him to react,

1517
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:27,132
thereby control his actions or
take anything away from him.

1518
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:29,552
But what about
the fourth level?

1519
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:31,762
Who told you
of the fourth level?

1520
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:33,723
I don't know, nobody told me
about the fourth level,

1521
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:36,434
it just kind of popped
into my head, that's all.

1522
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:38,602
Look, can I go
to my spiritual guide now?

1523
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:40,896
You may never go to him.

1524
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:42,607
He comes when he wills.

1525
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,650
And of yet, you are not ready.

1526
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:45,776
So why not?

1527
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:47,695
I thought I just conquered
my demon.

1528
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,239
You just met him, and learned
that your own

1529
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,740
worst demon is yourself.

1530
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:57,079
Your task now is to come
to thoroughly know

1531
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,915
your shadow and accept it,

1532
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:02,835
and by accepting your weaknesses
and human frailties.

1533
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:05,963
When your shadow
has become your friend,

1534
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,256
then your spiritual guide
will come for you,

1535
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:12,052
and only then
will you be ready.

1536
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:37,532
Grandfather. How is
all of this happening to me?

1537
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:08,483
I tried to get them to go wait
down the mountain, Billy,

1538
01:39:08,484 --> 01:39:10,194
but they insisted
on seeing you.

1539
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:12,154
That's all right.
We can talk on the way down.

1540
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:15,616
Look, we're worried
because the kids at the school

1541
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,034
are just going to forget
the whole thing

1542
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:20,203
and go off on one of their
nonviolent love kicks again.

1543
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:22,664
And all that will happen
is we'll get bombed again

1544
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:24,333
and more of our kids
will get killed.

1545
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,500
Yeah, look, Billy.

1546
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:26,585
There's a whole group of us.

1547
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:27,920
Billy, we'd like you
to lead us in.

1548
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,546
You know, hit them
with a counterattack.

1549
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:33,676
We could go in at night and bomb
their TV station for a change

1550
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,844
or kidnap somebody
from the town.

1551
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:38,013
Fight back.

1552
01:39:38,014 --> 01:39:41,392
Look, being strong is one thing,
but bombing is another.

1553
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:43,185
Why, because it's not open?

1554
01:39:43,186 --> 01:39:45,688
No, because it's the act
of a sick coward.

1555
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:48,232
So what the hell are we
supposed to do?

1556
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:49,900
Just roll over and play dead?

1557
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:51,152
Yeah, Billy, how much
can we take?

1558
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:53,237
Look, if I were a kid
in the barrio

1559
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:54,863
or the ghetto today,

1560
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:56,574
and I had to grow up seeing
my parents

1561
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,075
every day out of work

1562
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:00,202
or else lucky to get
a two-hour

1563
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:02,914
bus ride into the city
so they can make a few dollars

1564
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:04,916
cleaning up
the white man's filth

1565
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:08,252
and then return only to be
insulted by the landlords,

1566
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,920
the teachers and the police--

1567
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,881
the police?
They're so damn corrupt.

1568
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:14,842
I know they are, and I sure
as hell would be

1569
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:17,261
tempted to go off and do things
that would make

1570
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:20,555
the fanatic radicals
look like kindergarten kids.

1571
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:22,724
Well then, come on,
let's do it.

1572
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:23,892
Nothing else we can do.

1573
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:25,269
Does that mean you're going
to lead us

1574
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:26,436
in to bomb them back?

1575
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,564
- Yeah, come on, Billy.
- No, not in a million years.

1576
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:30,399
Why not, Billy?

1577
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:32,275
Because that kind of violence
never helps anybody

1578
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:33,860
or liberates anybody.

1579
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,529
It just gives some psychotic

1580
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,406
who's filled with a lot
of self-hatred

1581
01:40:37,406 --> 01:40:40,117
an excuse to kill a lot
of innocent bystanders

1582
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:42,119
and maybe grab a lot
of headlines

1583
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:44,204
by spouting
some sophomoric slogans

1584
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:46,123
about class struggle.

1585
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:48,500
And the end result
of the whole thing is it gives

1586
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:50,377
the law and order mentalities
like posner

1587
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,922
a chance to grab even
more power.

1588
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:55,424
As far as what's going on
back at the school

1589
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,176
I think you kids
are just gonna have to go back

1590
01:40:58,177 --> 01:40:59,803
and decide all that
for yourselves.

1591
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,911
H'

1592
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,665
what the hell is that?

1593
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:31,502
I don't know, sir.
Sounds like drums.

1594
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:34,213
Lieutenant, you better put
the men out on alert.

1595
01:41:34,213 --> 01:41:36,632
Sergeant, go out and see
what the noise is.

1596
01:41:45,141 --> 01:41:47,143
Hey, colonel.

1597
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:49,520
Maybe your revolution is gonna
come limping in here

1598
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,939
with a musket, fife and drum.

1599
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:55,650
H'

1600
01:42:14,587 --> 01:42:18,132
lieutenant, I don't think
you're gonna believe this.

1601
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:24,054
Come one, come all

1602
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:27,892
to the world's first
total man meet in history.

1603
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:31,562
Howard cosell, where are you?

1604
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,689
Each team has a poetry team,

1605
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:36,692
a belly dance team,
a rock band,

1606
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:40,362
a sprinter, a pole vaulter
and a relay team.

1607
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:44,075
No prizes, no awards,
and no politics.

1608
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:47,078
Just the fun of competing.

1609
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:50,039
Anyone can form a team
and join in.

1610
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:54,251
Man is both body and soul,
and physical and spiritual,

1611
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:58,505
so come to the first
total man meet in history.

1612
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:05,471
Hey, colonel. These radical
demonstrations

1613
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:07,222
can be awfully dangerous.

1614
01:43:07,223 --> 01:43:10,100
Think you and your men
can handle this one?

1615
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:12,603
Lieutenant, escort them.

1616
01:43:15,981 --> 01:43:18,650
Attention all units,
attention all units.

1617
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:20,110
Be on the alert.

1618
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:22,613
This could be a clever
diversionary tactic.

1619
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:25,741
All right, Carl,
knock it off.

1620
01:43:32,415 --> 01:43:35,167
It's no use, the wheel is just
getting deeper and deeper.

1621
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:36,835
Have you got
the tow truck yet?

1622
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:39,129
Hey, Jerry?

1623
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,714
I've already called
the tow truck

1624
01:43:40,715 --> 01:43:43,134
and they can't come out
until morning.

1625
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:44,301
Send another bus.

1626
01:43:45,928 --> 01:43:47,596
Oh, wait a minute.

1627
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:49,764
I think maybe there's
help coming.

1628
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:54,603
Yeah, someone's on their way.

1629
01:43:54,603 --> 01:43:56,771
Russell, that's not help.

1630
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,608
Jerry? Jerry?
Something funny's going on.

1631
01:43:59,608 --> 01:44:00,942
Call the sheriff.

1632
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,204
Well well well.

1633
01:44:12,204 --> 01:44:15,165
If it ain't our candle waving
culture group.

1634
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:18,794
Looks like you've got
a little problem here, huh?

1635
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:22,506
Well, I tell you, while you're
waiting for help, we'll, uh,

1636
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:24,674
we'll provide you
with a little culture, okay?

1637
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:26,635
Give me one of them violins.

1638
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:31,640
That is a guitar, stupid.

1639
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:37,938
They still can't find
the sheriff

1640
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,481
and Billy's on his way.

1641
01:44:39,482 --> 01:44:40,983
Tell him to keep trying.

1642
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:43,026
Try the state police.

1643
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:52,995
Well, lookie here.

1644
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:54,830
Really big man,
Jason, aren't you?

1645
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:03,005
Fellows, we can't fight
and we're not interested in--

1646
01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:05,048
just tell us what you want.

1647
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:34,953
Look, now, you've had your fun

1648
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,538
and you've really damaged
our bus.

1649
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:39,416
Now, you don't need
to burn it too.

1650
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:41,668
Please, don't burn our bus.

1651
01:46:18,497 --> 01:46:21,833
Oh, my my my, huh?

1652
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:24,962
You boys out for a little fun
and games?

1653
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:27,297
You just decide,
it's Saturday night,

1654
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:29,466
roll a bus over or two, huh?

1655
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:31,593
Well, it's something to do.

1656
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:34,930
Yeah, it beats going
to church, doesn't it?

1657
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,973
Well, yeah. Yeah.

1658
01:46:40,477 --> 01:46:43,480
Oh, man.

1659
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,315
He's a big one, jas.

1660
01:46:45,316 --> 01:46:47,985
- 6i9ll.
- 6i9ll.

1661
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:50,988
Really? How much do you weigh,

1662
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:54,491
about 265 pounds?

1663
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:58,991
- No, 285.
- 285.

1664
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:01,039
Two hundred
and eighty five pounds?

1665
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,083
- Right.
- Jason, I didn't think

1666
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,501
you guys piled it that high

1667
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:06,419
down here in your part
of the county, huh?

1668
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:12,134
Well, you know the funny thing
about being so big though

1669
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:13,760
is that a little girl,
like this

1670
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:16,180
luscious little
belly dancer here,

1671
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:20,309
she could take you right off
at the knees just like that.

1672
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:22,477
What's she going to use,
a buzz saw?

1673
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:25,647
No. She wouldn't use
a buzz saw. Just her knee.

1674
01:47:25,648 --> 01:47:29,109
Her knee? She couldn't even
get her knee up high enough.

1675
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:35,032
She doesn't have to kick you
in the family jewels.

1676
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:38,535
What she would do is...

1677
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:40,662
Right down there
inside the thigh.

1678
01:47:40,663 --> 01:47:42,331
Oh, I'm sure.

1679
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:46,831
And you know, not only that,
but if she did it right,

1680
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:49,546
you would not only go
down like a bomb,

1681
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:51,548
but she might even tear
that muscle

1682
01:47:51,548 --> 01:47:53,341
all the way
down under the kneecap.

1683
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:55,761
You might even
have to have surgery.

1684
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:58,221
Indian, you're full
of karate crap, you know that?

1685
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:03,726
Well, I knew he was going
to say that.

1686
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:07,939
I just knew you were
going to say that.

1687
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:12,440
And I suppose that means that
i will have to say to you

1688
01:48:13,404 --> 01:48:15,030
that I will have
to show you, right?

1689
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:18,366
Be my guest.

1690
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:20,285
And I suppose that's all right
with you, isn't it, Jason?

1691
01:48:20,285 --> 01:48:21,703
Good luck.

1692
01:48:21,704 --> 01:48:22,913
That's one thing about you,

1693
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:25,290
you've always had such
a generous heart, Jason.

1694
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:27,292
You don't mind at all that i--

1695
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:28,960
- go right ahead.
- ...Take him on, or--

1696
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:31,797
- sure.
- Wonderful fellow,

1697
01:48:31,797 --> 01:48:34,007
wonderful fellow.

1698
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,093
Well,

1699
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:39,763
you can't say that I didn't
warn you. Right?

1700
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:41,556
- Right.
- And you can't say

1701
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:42,432
that I didn't warn you?

1702
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:44,476
- No, no.
- Ls he a valuable man?

1703
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:47,270
- Ahh.
- So-so. So-so?

1704
01:48:47,271 --> 01:48:48,981
That's all you are?

1705
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:51,233
Well, in any event,
you can't say

1706
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:53,026
that I didn't
warn you, right?

1707
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:57,780
Now I suppose we're down
to that time when there's

1708
01:48:57,781 --> 01:49:01,659
really nothing left to do
but show you, is there?

1709
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:03,370
Be my guest.

1710
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,432
Joanne, what do you think
you're doing?

1711
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:25,183
Getting even.

1712
01:49:25,184 --> 01:49:26,476
What do you mean
getting even?

1713
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,270
This just pulls you
down to their level.

1714
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,605
Well, what the hell do you
call what you just did?

1715
01:49:30,606 --> 01:49:32,441
Come on, Billy.

1716
01:49:32,441 --> 01:49:35,819
Come on, you can debate
your visions later.

1717
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:40,782
Law association wants to know

1718
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:42,451
if you want to open
the legal seminar,

1719
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:43,785
- or speak last.
- Last.

1720
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:45,704
After everyone else
has gone home.

1721
01:49:45,704 --> 01:49:46,955
What's the matter?

1722
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:50,083
Look who they said
would never leave his room.

1723
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:56,089
Danny thinks he might like
to have that thing now,

1724
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:57,132
wouldn't you, Danny?

1725
01:49:57,132 --> 01:49:58,800
What thing?

1726
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:02,304
The thing that will help
his arm grab onto things.

1727
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:04,973
How in the world did you
ever do it?

1728
01:50:04,973 --> 01:50:08,309
Okay, almost. But you've
got to put this here,

1729
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:09,311
right like that.

1730
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:11,187
- I'll never learn.
- Yeah, you will.

1731
01:50:11,188 --> 01:50:12,480
And you'll sing up on
the platform

1732
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,733
- like the rest of the kids.
- I'd be so embarrassed.

1733
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:16,484
Will I really get
to play up there?

1734
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:18,236
Yeah, but you've gotta
work hard, okay? Ready?

1735
01:50:18,237 --> 01:50:19,655
- Really?
- Yeah, okay.

1736
01:50:21,365 --> 01:50:23,700
Do you mean he's actually
talking now?

1737
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,327
Yeah. With Carol he's become
a regular chatterbox.

1738
01:50:26,328 --> 01:50:28,538
That's beautiful.

1739
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:36,671
Change over to here,
like that.

1740
01:51:16,962 --> 01:51:18,755
Well, Jean, I hope this is
going to end

1741
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:20,715
your Indian
legal rights seminar.

1742
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:23,135
I know, I know.

1743
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:25,470
Not a mark on him and death
by accidental drowning.

1744
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:26,929
Well, what the hell
did you expect?

1745
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:30,892
Yeah, a sign?
Courtesy of w. A. Posner

1746
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:33,729
and his friends from the CIA?

1747
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:38,229
The mass confusion over really
what are the Indian rights

1748
01:51:38,734 --> 01:51:41,820
makes it impossible
for even Indian lawyers

1749
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:46,320
to grasp the laws that are
mostly aimed at depriving him

1750
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,660
of 13 million acres

1751
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:51,663
of prime real estate
in the United States.

1752
01:51:51,663 --> 01:51:55,458
Let us now look closely
at how these committees

1753
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:57,627
control the entire congress

1754
01:51:57,628 --> 01:52:02,128
and the entire spending,
so that 220 million people

1755
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:05,676
are totally controlled
by the votes of 4 or 5 men.

1756
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,845
The traders are given
a complete monopoly

1757
01:52:07,846 --> 01:52:09,472
on the reservation
by the bureau.

1758
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:12,976
Prices are inflated, sometimes
as much as a thousand percent.

1759
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:15,853
And when the little money that
these people have is gone,

1760
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:18,147
the traders extend credit
to them at interest rates

1761
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:21,192
usually falling between
48-75 percent annually.

1762
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:25,693
And the bia parading
their sell-out Indians around

1763
01:52:25,781 --> 01:52:27,532
before the public
as a camouflage,

1764
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:30,826
refuse to throw the traders
off the reservation

1765
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:34,455
or to even regulate
or in any way control them.

1766
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:36,291
Can you tell me why?

1767
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:38,960
The only possible reason
must be kickbacks,

1768
01:52:38,961 --> 01:52:41,129
tied in
with the first national bank

1769
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:42,630
and Mr. posner's trust funds.

1770
01:52:42,631 --> 01:52:45,842
These again regulated
by the bia.

1771
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:47,426
And the people that are going
to be the ones

1772
01:52:47,427 --> 01:52:49,345
that are suffering
are my people.

1773
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:51,556
People that are
on the grass roots level.

1774
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:53,516
Not the tribal councilmen.

1775
01:52:53,517 --> 01:52:55,268
Not the fat tribal councilmen
with their...

1776
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:57,980
Government or tribal cars.
Not them.

1777
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:00,148
And for years since I was
a little girl

1778
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:04,152
I've seen this go on
amongst our own people.

1779
01:53:04,152 --> 01:53:06,529
Graft and corruption.

1780
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:11,030
I call you brother, but I have
my hand in your pocket.

1781
01:53:11,493 --> 01:53:13,161
She calls me sister.

1782
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:16,414
She has a knife in my back.

1783
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:18,500
We talk about unity.

1784
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:22,712
Unity in the world,
in the government?

1785
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:25,006
Better start at home.
Charity begins at home.

1786
01:53:26,341 --> 01:53:30,219
And so in closing, please
let us try and remember

1787
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:33,765
the overwhelming despair
gnawing at every Indian

1788
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:37,059
and every other person
in the United States

1789
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,519
knowing that there
is no longer

1790
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:43,020
any way he can directly affect
the destiny of his country,

1791
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:47,111
and therefore, he can no longer
control his own life.

1792
01:53:47,112 --> 01:53:50,073
You know, it's hard to believe
that this country,

1793
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:53,367
which was started
in a small corner of Virginia,

1794
01:53:53,368 --> 01:53:56,746
where even though
the population was very small,

1795
01:53:56,747 --> 01:53:59,791
god created
such incredible people

1796
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:04,291
as James Monroe, James Madison,
George Washington,

1797
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:09,463
Patrick Henry, George wythe,
Peyton Randolph,

1798
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:14,222
George Mason, the unbelievable
Thomas Jefferson

1799
01:54:14,222 --> 01:54:16,599
and many, many others.

1800
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:17,976
The question now is

1801
01:54:19,144 --> 01:54:21,938
whether that incredible spirit
of those men

1802
01:54:21,938 --> 01:54:26,108
which created this country
is to be completely obliterated

1803
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:28,569
by the greed and corruption
which exists

1804
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:31,322
at every conceivable
political level

1805
01:54:31,323 --> 01:54:34,451
from the white house
to the teeniest trading post

1806
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:36,286
on the Indian reservation.

1807
01:54:36,661 --> 01:54:41,161
Do you know that one word,
just one word could change

1808
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:45,461
the entire course of the
American Indian legal destiny

1809
01:54:45,462 --> 01:54:49,007
and thereby change the destiny
for all of us here?

1810
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:51,426
And that is the word "honest."

1811
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:54,095
That one word could change
this government

1812
01:54:54,096 --> 01:54:55,263
and special interest groups

1813
01:54:55,263 --> 01:54:59,763
back to the spirit of Thomas
Jefferson and Patrick Henry.

1814
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:03,271
Which is of government
of the people.

1815
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:07,525
Jefferson summed it all up
in one phrase.

1816
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:12,026
"The entire art of government
is being honest."

1817
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:19,495
To those of you who make
peaceful evolution impossible,

1818
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:21,623
it is you and only you

1819
01:55:21,623 --> 01:55:25,460
that will make
violent revolution inevitable.

1820
01:55:26,628 --> 01:55:28,630
Thank you.

1821
01:55:33,552 --> 01:55:35,554
A conservator is like
a guardian, young lady.

1822
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:38,056
If you hit me, you'll be
in contempt of court.

1823
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:41,184
I'll do it, I swear to you
I'll do it, now get out.

1824
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,810
I'm taking the child.

1825
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:45,104
No, you're not.

1826
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:53,404
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

1827
01:55:53,405 --> 01:55:56,324
I haven't discharged
this patient yet.

1828
01:55:56,324 --> 01:55:58,492
We petitioned the court
to name me as conservator.

1829
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:05,166
Normally, I am a peaceful
man, Carl.

1830
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:08,211
But if he's not out of this room
by the time I turn around

1831
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:11,214
I'm throwing this vile,
decaying dung heap

1832
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:12,590
right through that window.

1833
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:15,176
Now you get him the hell
out of here.

1834
01:56:15,177 --> 01:56:17,554
Until the court does appoint
you conservator,

1835
01:56:17,554 --> 01:56:19,514
this is illegal, Harry,
and you know it.

1836
01:56:19,514 --> 01:56:21,724
Now come on. Let's go down
the hall and talk this over.

1837
01:56:23,351 --> 01:56:25,061
Now, don't you worry, honey.

1838
01:56:25,061 --> 01:56:27,104
We're gonna get him back
to the school. All right?

1839
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:28,397
Phew.

1840
01:56:37,574 --> 01:56:40,868
They're coming
to arrest grandfather.

1841
01:56:40,869 --> 01:56:43,621
They're coming
to arrest grandfather.

1842
01:56:43,622 --> 01:56:48,122
All right, Cole, what's
this warrant for?

1843
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,753
You're not going to take him
in, Cole.

1844
01:56:50,754 --> 01:56:53,590
Cole, I don't believe this.
This is absurd.

1845
01:56:53,590 --> 01:56:55,633
Absolutely absurd.

1846
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:58,553
Grandfather would never
accept lease money.

1847
01:56:58,553 --> 01:57:00,263
Yellow hawk is behind this.

1848
01:57:00,263 --> 01:57:02,723
Obviously that's a frame up,

1849
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:04,767
but just as obviously
you can beat it.

1850
01:57:04,768 --> 01:57:07,812
Unless someone else does
something stupid.

1851
01:57:07,812 --> 01:57:11,232
He's right.

1852
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:12,609
Come on, grandfather.

1853
01:57:12,609 --> 01:57:14,027
I'll go in with you.

1854
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:24,495
Hey, blue elk.

1855
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:26,122
It's me, jas.

1856
01:57:26,122 --> 01:57:28,749
Got a minute?

1857
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,334
What's up?

1858
01:57:30,335 --> 01:57:32,628
Well, uh, they asked me
to come out here and see if

1859
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:35,089
maybe you want to come in
for a little private talk.

1860
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:37,133
Maybe we can do something
about the old man.

1861
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:38,259
Who's they?

1862
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:41,179
They just, uh, told us
to come out here

1863
01:57:41,179 --> 01:57:42,805
and see if you would be
interested in a deal.

1864
01:57:42,806 --> 01:57:47,268
That's all. They just want us
to come get you.

1865
01:57:47,269 --> 01:57:49,437
You wouldn't be playing
any games, would you?

1866
01:57:49,437 --> 01:57:51,480
Now look, if they'd
have wanted to hurt you,

1867
01:57:51,481 --> 01:57:53,816
they would have done it
a long time ago.

1868
01:57:53,817 --> 01:57:56,444
Yeah. What do you think?

1869
01:57:56,444 --> 01:57:59,447
Well, if it will help.

1870
01:57:59,447 --> 01:58:01,323
Yeah, why not?

1871
01:58:01,324 --> 01:58:02,783
Columbus took a chance,
didn't he?

1872
01:58:02,784 --> 01:58:05,578
There you go. And look
what happened to the Indians.

1873
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:12,835
Just go around the other side.

1874
01:58:19,676 --> 01:58:21,636
Hey. He!!!

1875
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:25,974
H'

1876
01:58:47,662 --> 01:58:49,205
well, we worked him over

1877
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:51,749
then we worked him over again
but still no deal.

1878
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:53,668
- Well, where is he?
- He's out back.

1879
01:59:07,515 --> 01:59:10,017
Well now, what in the world
happened to you, blue elk?

1880
01:59:10,018 --> 01:59:12,603
What's the matter
with you, posner?

1881
01:59:12,604 --> 01:59:15,398
I'm not one
of your drunken Indians.

1882
01:59:15,398 --> 01:59:19,193
Doing this to me is going
to create a lot of attention.

1883
01:59:19,194 --> 01:59:21,696
That's the general idea.

1884
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:27,368
In other words, blue elk,

1885
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:29,496
we're going to make an
example out of you.

1886
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:38,754
Ladies and gentlemen,

1887
01:59:39,673 --> 01:59:41,966
we got a special attraction
here tonight.

1888
01:59:42,884 --> 01:59:44,594
Our good friend blue elk
is going to do

1889
01:59:44,594 --> 01:59:47,763
an authentic Indian war dance
for you. Ain't you, boy?

1890
01:59:47,764 --> 01:59:50,099
A little music there, maestro.

1891
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:52,560
Let's get out of here.

1892
01:59:56,398 --> 01:59:58,983
Give me that stick,
drummer boy.

1893
01:59:58,983 --> 02:00:01,527
H'

1894
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:10,786
that damn Indian ain't gonna
dance,jaycee.

1895
02:00:10,787 --> 02:00:14,624
Oh, he's gonna dance,
all right. Ain't you, boy?

1896
02:00:16,334 --> 02:00:20,004
You gonna dance,
ain't you, boy?

1897
02:00:20,004 --> 02:00:23,924
'Cause if you don't dance, son,
I'm gonna burn all the skin

1898
02:00:23,925 --> 02:00:26,177
off the bottom of your feet.

1899
02:01:04,174 --> 02:01:05,800
Use your head, Billy.

1900
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:08,135
I thought after the last time
you'd see

1901
02:01:08,136 --> 02:01:10,263
this creates problems,
it doesn't solve them.

1902
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:12,849
What about your vision,
you going to throw

1903
02:01:12,849 --> 02:01:14,350
that away again, too?

1904
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:16,477
Damn it, Billy, does somebody
else have to be killed

1905
02:01:16,478 --> 02:01:18,354
before you'll learn?

1906
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:20,481
Look. There is a human being
lying down there who also

1907
02:01:20,482 --> 02:01:22,358
happens to be my friend.
Now you tell me what do you

1908
02:01:22,358 --> 02:01:24,651
want me to do,
just leave him lie there?

1909
02:01:39,042 --> 02:01:41,711
Oh my god.

1910
02:01:44,339 --> 02:01:46,549
Come on, honey, this is insane.
Let's get out of here.

1911
02:01:46,549 --> 02:01:49,593
Why? It's time
they got theirs.

1912
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:51,887
I said now.

1913
02:01:51,888 --> 02:01:55,224
Mrs. clure, how could you
do this?

1914
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:02,398
Dr. alem, you're a dentist.
You took an oath.

1915
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:06,276
Don't you dare turn
away from me. Look at him.

1916
02:02:06,277 --> 02:02:08,988
How could you
possibly enjoy this?

1917
02:02:17,038 --> 02:02:18,998
What are you,
a bunch of animals?

1918
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:51,572
Aw, come on. You guys
aren't going to really use

1919
02:02:51,573 --> 02:02:52,949
all of these things now,
are you?

1920
02:02:52,949 --> 02:02:55,409
Try us.

1921
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:59,122
If you're giving me a choice,
i would just as soon

1922
02:02:59,122 --> 02:03:01,457
quietly walk out of here
and go on home.

1923
02:03:01,457 --> 02:03:03,834
Billy, stop it.

1924
02:03:03,835 --> 02:03:05,336
Somebody stop it.

1925
02:03:05,336 --> 02:03:08,630
What are you, insane?

1926
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:11,383
All we want to do is take
our friend blue elk

1927
02:03:11,384 --> 02:03:12,968
and quietly walk out of here.

1928
02:03:12,969 --> 02:03:14,971
Not this time, Billy.

1929
02:03:14,971 --> 02:03:16,764
Oh, posner.
For god's sakes.

1930
02:03:16,764 --> 02:03:20,142
There are witnesses.
Hundreds of them.

1931
02:03:20,143 --> 02:03:22,770
He's not walking out of here.

1932
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:25,105
Well, if that's the way it's
going to be, buster,

1933
02:03:25,106 --> 02:03:26,982
you're going to have to
club me down first,

1934
02:03:26,983 --> 02:03:28,526
are you ready to do that?

1935
02:03:28,526 --> 02:03:31,028
If I have to.

1936
02:03:31,029 --> 02:03:33,489
Damn you.

1937
02:03:36,618 --> 02:03:39,662
Somebody get the police
and hurry.

1938
02:03:41,164 --> 02:03:43,457
Just your feet
against all of this?

1939
02:03:43,458 --> 02:03:47,958
Well, looks like we're just
going to have to improvise.

1940
02:03:50,214 --> 02:03:53,467
You know, I don't remember who
it was, but somebody one time

1941
02:03:53,468 --> 02:03:57,638
told me that if there's
absolutely no way that you can

1942
02:03:57,639 --> 02:04:00,099
get out of taking a terrible
beating,

1943
02:04:00,099 --> 02:04:01,725
the only intelligent thing
for you to do

1944
02:04:01,726 --> 02:04:04,437
is to try to get in
the first lick.

1945
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:28,377
Get him.

1946
02:06:29,874 --> 02:06:31,792
I dislocated it.

1947
02:06:33,294 --> 02:06:35,963
Oh come on,
it's just separated.

1948
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:39,299
Quit bellowing like such
a baby, I'll set it for you.

1949
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:41,218
Bring it up.

1950
02:06:41,219 --> 02:06:43,095
This part's going to hurt you.

1951
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:52,647
Oh, posner.

1952
02:06:55,691 --> 02:07:00,191
Look, up until now, it has been
just a couple of broken bones.

1953
02:07:00,196 --> 02:07:03,449
So why don't you put the gun
away, and back off.

1954
02:07:08,871 --> 02:07:11,248
Tell me something.

1955
02:07:11,249 --> 02:07:14,252
Were posners all born
to be jackasses?

1956
02:07:14,252 --> 02:07:16,587
If you miss me, you're going
to hit one of your own men.

1957
02:07:16,587 --> 02:07:20,007
Please. I'm asking you nice,
if that will help.

1958
02:07:20,007 --> 02:07:24,386
Why don't you just put the gun
away let's quietly go on home.

1959
02:07:24,387 --> 02:07:27,556
I'm arresting you
for assault.

1960
02:07:29,851 --> 02:07:32,061
You have no right
to hold me here.

1961
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:34,271
I'm a free man.

1962
02:07:34,272 --> 02:07:35,690
I'm arresting you too.

1963
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:38,526
One false move
and I'll kill you.

1964
02:07:38,526 --> 02:07:40,236
By god, I'll kill you.

1965
02:07:40,236 --> 02:07:42,696
Han, don't.

1966
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:44,115
Please.

1967
02:07:44,115 --> 02:07:46,033
L'm begging yo"-

1968
02:07:46,033 --> 02:07:47,534
don't think I'm kidding.

1969
02:08:38,336 --> 02:08:39,795
You satisfied?

1970
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:53,601
I'm taking you in, Billy.

1971
02:08:53,601 --> 02:08:56,770
No, I can't let you
do that, Cole.

1972
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:59,106
My god, man. When are you
going to stop being a fool?

1973
02:09:01,609 --> 02:09:03,110
If I let you take me in,

1974
02:09:03,110 --> 02:09:04,986
we both know that would be
a bullet in my head.

1975
02:09:04,987 --> 02:09:07,781
Not while I'm around.

1976
02:09:07,782 --> 02:09:10,785
Billy, I have to do this.

1977
02:09:10,785 --> 02:09:12,453
No, Cole. I'm not going to
let you take me.

1978
02:09:50,074 --> 02:09:51,408
It's a full-scale riot.

1979
02:09:51,409 --> 02:09:53,869
They want the guard and the
standby federal troops.

1980
02:09:53,869 --> 02:09:55,537
Yeah, who's screaming
the loudest?

1981
02:09:55,538 --> 02:09:58,582
You want them
in alphabetical order?

1982
02:09:58,582 --> 02:10:00,166
I heard posner's been killed.

1983
02:10:00,167 --> 02:10:01,710
Are you sure?

1984
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:03,003
Yes, sir.

1985
02:10:03,004 --> 02:10:04,380
How?

1986
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:07,216
Billy Jack.

1987
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:08,550
Well, get him.

1988
02:10:08,551 --> 02:10:09,885
I'm afraid we can't, sir.

1989
02:10:09,885 --> 02:10:11,887
The whole world saw it, it was
clearly self-defense.

1990
02:10:11,887 --> 02:10:14,014
I said arrest him.

1991
02:10:30,031 --> 02:10:31,240
Glad you got here, colonel.

1992
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:33,951
You have no legal right
to be here.

1993
02:10:33,951 --> 02:10:36,078
Sorry, ma'am.

1994
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:37,204
We're taking our orders

1995
02:10:37,204 --> 02:10:38,830
directly from the governor's
the governor's office.

1996
02:10:38,831 --> 02:10:41,458
This show of force is just
going to fan reaction.

1997
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:43,043
Is that what you want?

1998
02:10:43,044 --> 02:10:44,587
Just what are your orders?

1999
02:10:45,004 --> 02:10:46,672
To stay in this position

2000
02:10:46,672 --> 02:10:48,632
until Billy Jack is placed
under arrest.

2001
02:10:57,892 --> 02:11:02,229
On top of everything else,
now it starts to rain.

2002
02:11:03,481 --> 02:11:05,232
I don't know, Billy.

2003
02:11:05,232 --> 02:11:07,484
Maybe I should have listened

2004
02:11:07,485 --> 02:11:09,653
and cut back on some
of those exposes.

2005
02:11:10,946 --> 02:11:12,906
You know what I think?

2006
02:11:12,907 --> 02:11:15,075
No, what?

2007
02:11:15,076 --> 02:11:17,745
I think that your refusal
to stop those exposes

2008
02:11:17,745 --> 02:11:21,457
and give advice is kind of
a cop out.

2009
02:11:21,457 --> 02:11:23,250
Just what do you mean by that?

2010
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:26,086
Well, by not ever giving
advice you don't ever have

2011
02:11:26,087 --> 02:11:29,090
the awesome responsibility
of someone following your advise

2012
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:30,800
and making a terrible mistake.

2013
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:33,093
Maybe getting hurt.

2014
02:11:33,094 --> 02:11:35,596
It's kind of a nice, safe way
to do it.

2015
02:11:35,596 --> 02:11:40,096
Are you accusing me of being
afraid of responsibility?

2016
02:11:40,142 --> 02:11:43,019
In some ways, yes.

2017
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:46,106
Why else didn't you speak up
about the exposes?

2018
02:11:46,107 --> 02:11:47,733
I mean, after Nixon resigned,

2019
02:11:47,733 --> 02:11:49,526
why didn't you do something
about it then?

2020
02:11:49,527 --> 02:11:52,821
Because I thought the kids
were doing the right thing.

2021
02:11:52,822 --> 02:11:54,865
Your trouble is that you think

2022
02:11:54,865 --> 02:11:56,992
everybody is pure of heart
and gives a damn.

2023
02:11:56,992 --> 02:11:58,827
What's that supposed to mean?

2024
02:11:58,828 --> 02:12:02,122
Well, you think that all
you have to do is bring

2025
02:12:02,123 --> 02:12:03,791
all these injustices
out in the open

2026
02:12:03,791 --> 02:12:07,336
and everybody's going to rise up
and do something about it.

2027
02:12:07,336 --> 02:12:10,213
Look what happened to Kennedy
after chappaquiddick.

2028
02:12:10,214 --> 02:12:12,966
Or all the crooks with Nixon
and Watergate.

2029
02:12:12,967 --> 02:12:14,593
Things went right on.
People forget.

2030
02:12:16,846 --> 02:12:21,346
Come on, to hell
with all that.

2031
02:12:21,851 --> 02:12:23,143
The only important thing now

2032
02:12:23,144 --> 02:12:24,812
is how can we get
out of this mess

2033
02:12:24,812 --> 02:12:27,147
without somebody getting hurt.

2034
02:12:27,148 --> 02:12:29,441
I think you've got to try
and slip out of here

2035
02:12:29,442 --> 02:12:30,901
any way you can.

2036
02:12:32,027 --> 02:12:33,278
It's funny. Last time you were
the one

2037
02:12:33,279 --> 02:12:35,364
who couldn't wait
for me to surrender.

2038
02:12:35,364 --> 02:12:38,033
It's not funny.

2039
02:12:38,033 --> 02:12:40,869
It's totally different
this time.

2040
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:43,163
They're going to
kill you, Billy.

2041
02:12:47,084 --> 02:12:48,585
How many kids were shot

2042
02:12:48,586 --> 02:12:49,878
at that Kent state
and all those other--

2043
02:12:49,879 --> 02:12:52,339
what in the hell does that
have to do with anything?

2044
02:12:52,339 --> 02:12:54,382
It has everything
to do with it.

2045
02:12:54,383 --> 02:12:56,593
If they have to force their way
in here looking for me

2046
02:12:56,594 --> 02:12:59,388
a lot of people
are going to get hurt.

2047
02:12:59,388 --> 02:13:01,181
Now look at who's
the nonviolent one.

2048
02:13:01,182 --> 02:13:02,933
No, I'm not being nonviolent.

2049
02:13:02,933 --> 02:13:06,519
I'm just trying to buy
a little bit of time.

2050
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:09,189
Besides, they wouldn't dare
hurt me now.

2051
02:13:15,738 --> 02:13:18,407
Carl.

2052
02:13:18,407 --> 02:13:20,367
Don't anybody move.

2053
02:13:21,452 --> 02:13:23,120
All right, I'll surrender
peaceably

2054
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:24,913
if I have the governor's
personal word

2055
02:13:24,914 --> 02:13:27,583
that you'll take
all these troops,

2056
02:13:27,583 --> 02:13:30,627
move off the campus and clear
out of the reservation.

2057
02:13:30,628 --> 02:13:32,296
Those are
the governor's orders.

2058
02:13:32,296 --> 02:13:35,132
We're to pull out just as soon
as you're in jail.

2059
02:13:35,132 --> 02:13:36,258
That's the deal, Billy.

2060
02:13:36,258 --> 02:13:37,592
You heard it personally?

2061
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:40,220
That's right, Billy.
I was there.

2062
02:13:40,221 --> 02:13:43,098
All right.
I'll be down shortly.

2063
02:13:46,268 --> 02:13:48,770
Look.

2064
02:13:48,771 --> 02:13:51,899
I came up here so fast
i forgot to bring bullets.

2065
02:13:53,984 --> 02:13:56,319
Come on. They wouldn't dare
do something to me now,

2066
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,612
it'd be much too obvious.

2067
02:13:57,613 --> 02:13:59,448
I'm sorry, Carl,
but this warrant

2068
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:00,949
is from the state's
Attorney General.

2069
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:02,493
He's under state custody.

2070
02:14:02,493 --> 02:14:03,994
The hell he is.

2071
02:14:03,994 --> 02:14:06,287
- I'll take him in.
- No, you won't.

2072
02:14:06,288 --> 02:14:08,123
The Attorney General received
orders directly

2073
02:14:08,123 --> 02:14:10,917
from the state supreme court and
gave them personally to me.

2074
02:14:10,918 --> 02:14:13,128
I'm sorry, Carl.

2075
02:14:13,128 --> 02:14:16,631
Then I'll follow along
and make sure nothing happens.

2076
02:14:16,632 --> 02:14:19,468
He's yours, Stanley.

2077
02:14:37,653 --> 02:14:40,489
Move that truck.

2078
02:14:46,161 --> 02:14:48,830
Are you going to move that
truck or am I? Now move it.

2079
02:14:48,831 --> 02:14:50,749
Sergeant, do you think we have
someone

2080
02:14:50,749 --> 02:14:52,083
who can do something
about this?

2081
02:14:58,340 --> 02:14:59,841
What the hell is that?

2082
02:14:59,842 --> 02:15:01,677
Just a precaution, ma'am.

2083
02:15:01,677 --> 02:15:04,054
What do you mean precaution,
i thought the deal was

2084
02:15:04,054 --> 02:15:05,847
when Billy surrendered
the governor would take

2085
02:15:05,848 --> 02:15:07,808
all you gestapo out of here.

2086
02:15:07,808 --> 02:15:10,352
Don't bite at me, lady.
I'm just an order taker.

2087
02:15:25,784 --> 02:15:27,285
All right. Go ahead
and take your leak.

2088
02:15:28,662 --> 02:15:30,413
I never said I had to
take a leak.

2089
02:15:30,414 --> 02:15:32,624
Regulations.

2090
02:15:52,436 --> 02:15:55,856
Pick it up. It may be dangerous
out there in the dark.

2091
02:16:24,635 --> 02:16:26,386
Now, that's
the funniest thing.

2092
02:16:26,387 --> 02:16:29,098
You know, one time,
i don't remember where,

2093
02:16:29,098 --> 02:16:30,599
somebody told me

2094
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:33,768
that if at any time I was
ever arrested and they gave me

2095
02:16:33,769 --> 02:16:36,897
a handgun and said something
about taking a leak--

2096
02:16:50,285 --> 02:16:51,619
oh!

2097
02:16:57,459 --> 02:17:00,628
My god, man. Do you realize
what they will do to us?

2098
02:17:00,629 --> 02:17:03,673
Shut up and fan out.

2099
02:17:03,674 --> 02:17:05,967
I'm not going out in the dark
after him.

2100
02:17:05,968 --> 02:17:07,469
Are you nuts?

2101
02:17:07,469 --> 02:17:08,845
To hell with you.

2102
02:17:08,846 --> 02:17:10,347
I know I hit him.

2103
02:17:10,347 --> 02:17:13,558
Fan out. Move it.

2104
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:41,795
One sound and I tear out
the windpipe.

2105
02:17:41,795 --> 02:17:45,340
Now get your handgun out and
bring it up to me very easy.

2106
02:17:50,012 --> 02:17:51,513
All right.

2107
02:17:51,513 --> 02:17:53,556
Now, I want the keys
to these cuffs

2108
02:17:53,557 --> 02:17:57,018
and the coil wire from this car
and the microphone.

2109
02:17:57,019 --> 02:17:59,688
You understand?

2110
02:17:59,688 --> 02:18:01,147
Real slow.

2111
02:18:07,988 --> 02:18:09,322
Well, did you see anything?

2112
02:18:09,323 --> 02:18:10,532
No, sir.

2113
02:18:10,532 --> 02:18:12,158
Not a damn sign of him.

2114
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:14,536
Yes, there is.
This looks like blood.

2115
02:18:14,536 --> 02:18:16,454
Turn on the headlights, ed.

2116
02:18:17,915 --> 02:18:19,166
Swing it over here.

2117
02:18:37,392 --> 02:18:40,561
I was wrong when I said
to turn the other cheek.

2118
02:18:40,562 --> 02:18:43,231
Brute power can only be met
by brute power.

2119
02:18:43,232 --> 02:18:45,567
We've got to fight back.

2120
02:18:52,950 --> 02:18:54,826
Better than that,
we can bomb the dam.

2121
02:18:58,080 --> 02:19:01,708
Shut up. We'll get
that coverage on CBS.

2122
02:19:16,807 --> 02:19:19,518
We don't want to hear
some speech.

2123
02:19:24,648 --> 02:19:26,775
Shut up! Shut up!

2124
02:19:26,775 --> 02:19:29,235
Listen to me.

2125
02:19:29,236 --> 02:19:30,779
Listen to me.

2126
02:19:30,779 --> 02:19:32,071
Listen to me.

2127
02:19:35,576 --> 02:19:37,077
Listen to me.

2128
02:19:37,077 --> 02:19:39,788
Now, Jean, built this school
without any help from us

2129
02:19:39,788 --> 02:19:42,749
and she does not need any help
from us to rip it down.

2130
02:19:42,749 --> 02:19:45,418
She can do just fine on her
own if that's what she wants.

2131
02:19:45,419 --> 02:19:47,879
I think she has a right to,
you know,

2132
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:49,423
voice an opinion
on what she wants.

2133
02:19:57,347 --> 02:19:59,432
Stop that.

2134
02:20:02,144 --> 02:20:04,938
As long as this is the end
of our dream,

2135
02:20:04,938 --> 02:20:06,105
and the end
of our school,

2136
02:20:06,106 --> 02:20:07,857
I think we should let
Jean talk.

2137
02:20:13,614 --> 02:20:15,616
Stop. All of you.

2138
02:20:17,117 --> 02:20:18,910
Damn it, I'm mad.

2139
02:20:21,663 --> 02:20:24,332
And you, Jocelyn, I don't care
if you want a speech or not,

2140
02:20:24,333 --> 02:20:27,961
you're going
to hear one, baby.

2141
02:20:27,961 --> 02:20:31,130
I've never asked for one thing
from one of you in this school

2142
02:20:31,131 --> 02:20:34,759
in my life and damn it
I'm going to ask now.

2143
02:20:37,471 --> 02:20:39,347
I've decided this minute
after sitting here

2144
02:20:39,348 --> 02:20:40,515
and watching you guys,

2145
02:20:40,515 --> 02:20:42,350
I'm going to stop giving.

2146
02:20:42,351 --> 02:20:44,644
And I'm going to demand
that you give me five minutes

2147
02:20:44,645 --> 02:20:45,687
of your lousy time,

2148
02:20:45,687 --> 02:20:49,107
and believe me, right now
it's plenty lousy.

2149
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:55,029
I can tell you,
i can promise you,

2150
02:20:55,030 --> 02:20:58,366
if the cop came
into this room

2151
02:20:58,367 --> 02:21:01,203
that shot Billy Jack,
I'd shoot him.

2152
02:21:01,203 --> 02:21:04,915
I'd shoot him.
I know that.

2153
02:21:04,915 --> 02:21:08,376
But god help me he's not here
now so I don't have to

2154
02:21:08,377 --> 02:21:09,878
and I can think a little bit.

2155
02:21:13,173 --> 02:21:15,091
Now, we could go out there.

2156
02:21:15,092 --> 02:21:17,886
Some of us would get shot.

2157
02:21:17,886 --> 02:21:19,345
A few of you would get killed.

2158
02:21:19,346 --> 02:21:20,513
You, maybe, Jocelyn.

2159
02:21:23,183 --> 02:21:25,268
You can die now
if you want to.

2160
02:21:25,268 --> 02:21:26,894
Go ahead.

2161
02:21:26,895 --> 02:21:28,229
What's a life?

2162
02:21:28,230 --> 02:21:32,359
It's easy, you can make them
like that, right?

2163
02:21:32,359 --> 02:21:35,779
Dying is a big step,
and if we wanted to,

2164
02:21:35,779 --> 02:21:38,406
and if we really want to die

2165
02:21:38,407 --> 02:21:40,617
and if we really want
to ruin this school

2166
02:21:40,617 --> 02:21:42,744
and totally destroy it,

2167
02:21:42,744 --> 02:21:46,080
I think we can do it
just as easily tomorrow

2168
02:21:46,081 --> 02:21:48,291
as we can tonight.

2169
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:51,377
And it may give us a chance to
find out why we're doing this.

2170
02:21:51,378 --> 02:21:54,214
Why, what's this
happening for?

2171
02:21:57,634 --> 02:22:00,595
My feeling is, and I know right
now it doesn't mean a damn thing

2172
02:22:00,595 --> 02:22:01,596
to any of you

2173
02:22:01,596 --> 02:22:03,889
but I'm going to say it
anyway,

2174
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:07,226
I feel that right now
this is our crucial test.

2175
02:22:07,227 --> 02:22:09,270
Oh, we're all big mouths.

2176
02:22:09,271 --> 02:22:11,398
We've got great mouths in
telling about this

2177
02:22:11,398 --> 02:22:12,899
great love
we have here.

2178
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:14,233
And what it means.

2179
02:22:14,234 --> 02:22:16,402
And boy this whole school is
really built on it, isn't it?

2180
02:22:16,403 --> 02:22:18,738
I saw it tonight.
It was beautiful.

2181
02:22:18,739 --> 02:22:21,908
Just gorgeous.

2182
02:22:21,908 --> 02:22:24,827
But the question is can
this great love withstand

2183
02:22:24,828 --> 02:22:28,248
what they are doing to us
out there right now?

2184
02:22:28,248 --> 02:22:29,958
Or is that brute violence

2185
02:22:29,958 --> 02:22:32,794
the thing that's going to
overcome the world?

2186
02:22:37,466 --> 02:22:40,051
Now, you all know Danny,

2187
02:22:40,052 --> 02:22:43,555
and you know
the tremendous love

2188
02:22:43,555 --> 02:22:46,724
and time Carol has put in

2189
02:22:46,725 --> 02:22:51,225
to what everyone told us was
an absolutely hopeless case.

2190
02:22:53,565 --> 02:22:57,235
She has been working
for over one month

2191
02:22:57,235 --> 02:22:59,278
to try and teach him a song

2192
02:22:59,279 --> 02:23:02,407
because he's wanted to come up
here on this stage

2193
02:23:02,407 --> 02:23:06,369
like you big guys,
you big shots, and sing.

2194
02:23:09,831 --> 02:23:12,917
Well, there may not be
a platform here tomorrow,

2195
02:23:12,918 --> 02:23:14,753
there may not be
a school here tomorrow.

2196
02:23:14,753 --> 02:23:17,255
You may not be here tomorrow.

2197
02:23:17,255 --> 02:23:21,425
You may not be here tomorrow,

2198
02:23:21,426 --> 02:23:25,138
because you may decide to go
out and get yourselves shot.

2199
02:23:27,557 --> 02:23:30,601
So I'm going to ask you
one small favor.

2200
02:23:32,562 --> 02:23:37,062
Can you give Danny his chance
to be a big guy?

2201
02:23:38,151 --> 02:23:41,654
And I hope to god he doesn't
turn out like some of you.

2202
02:23:43,532 --> 02:23:46,493
So Carol, Danny,

2203
02:23:46,493 --> 02:23:49,329
would you please come up now
and please,

2204
02:23:49,329 --> 02:23:50,330
let him have his chance.

2205
02:24:05,679 --> 02:24:07,389
Ready?

2206
02:24:07,389 --> 02:24:09,516
Want to start us off?

2207
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:53,643
We did it.

2208
02:24:53,643 --> 02:24:55,269
All the way through it.

2209
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:57,105
Good.

2210
02:25:00,275 --> 02:25:01,901
Thank you.

2211
02:25:06,907 --> 02:25:09,951
I'm well aware of that,
but ask for them anyway.

2212
02:25:09,951 --> 02:25:13,245
I don't give a damn,
we need some help.

2213
02:25:13,246 --> 02:25:15,498
All right.

2214
02:25:15,498 --> 02:25:16,790
Well, they won't pull out.

2215
02:25:16,791 --> 02:25:18,918
We're trying to ask
for federal marshals.

2216
02:25:18,919 --> 02:25:20,962
Has anybody gotten through
to the governor yet?

2217
02:25:20,962 --> 02:25:23,089
Oh, Jean, I've been trying
to get him all afternoon.

2218
02:25:23,089 --> 02:25:25,633
No, he doesn't have time
for a phone call.

2219
02:25:25,634 --> 02:25:28,637
But look at him. He's acting
like the archangel Gabriel.

2220
02:25:28,637 --> 02:25:31,306
So I pledge to you

2221
02:25:31,306 --> 02:25:33,433
that while we will never
provoke any confrontation--

2222
02:25:33,433 --> 02:25:36,144
- damn you liar.
- ...We will never surrender

2223
02:25:36,144 --> 02:25:40,644
one square foot of this state
to any lawless anarchists.

2224
02:25:40,941 --> 02:25:43,026
Wherever the first firebomb
is thrown,

2225
02:25:43,026 --> 02:25:45,319
wherever the first
brick is thrown,

2226
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:48,114
wherever the first house
is set on fire,

2227
02:25:48,114 --> 02:25:50,616
then we will make our move.

2228
02:25:50,617 --> 02:25:52,827
I have been in contact
with Washington

2229
02:25:52,827 --> 02:25:56,163
and have been promised
full support.

2230
02:25:56,164 --> 02:25:59,458
Well, so much for any hope
of getting the federal marshals.

2231
02:25:59,459 --> 02:26:01,002
And to every citizen
in this state,

2232
02:26:01,002 --> 02:26:04,046
let me be perfectly clear.

2233
02:26:04,047 --> 02:26:06,299
We will move with everything
in our power

2234
02:26:06,299 --> 02:26:08,718
to protect all life--

2235
02:26:08,718 --> 02:26:11,011
oh, no. Would you believe it?

2236
02:26:11,012 --> 02:26:11,971
Look at that.

2237
02:26:11,972 --> 02:26:13,473
This has been
a remote telecast

2238
02:26:13,473 --> 02:26:15,224
direct from the governor's
office

2239
02:26:15,225 --> 02:26:16,309
at the state capital.

2240
02:26:16,309 --> 02:26:19,228
God above. How can they
be so stupid?

2241
02:26:19,229 --> 02:26:23,316
No, it's not stupid.
It's a well thought-out plan.

2242
02:26:54,222 --> 02:26:55,348
Oh, I almost forgot.

2243
02:26:55,348 --> 02:26:57,266
Call Joe, tell him
i won't be in to work

2244
02:26:57,267 --> 02:26:59,060
k for three or four
more days.

2245
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:01,437
Please, please be careful.

2246
02:27:01,438 --> 02:27:03,231
Don't worry, for god's sakes.

2247
02:27:03,231 --> 02:27:04,732
Why is mommy so upset?

2248
02:27:04,733 --> 02:27:07,569
Well, she's just
being silly, Danny.

2249
02:27:07,569 --> 02:27:09,404
Now give your old dad a hug.

2250
02:27:09,404 --> 02:27:10,655
It's gotta last me
a couple days.

2251
02:27:13,742 --> 02:27:15,618
The governor's office
wants verification

2252
02:27:15,618 --> 02:27:17,328
that radicals are pouring
into the school

2253
02:27:17,329 --> 02:27:18,538
from all over the state.

2254
02:27:18,538 --> 02:27:20,540
- Verified.
- Verified.

2255
02:27:25,879 --> 02:27:27,088
All right.

2256
02:27:27,088 --> 02:27:28,923
Now, it's your job to cover
the hill.

2257
02:27:28,923 --> 02:27:32,259
Any kid comes up from the school
you warn him once.

2258
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:34,929
You fire a warning shot in the
air and then you shoot to kill.

2259
02:27:34,929 --> 02:27:38,098
Now, they've got snipers
all over the place out there.

2260
02:27:38,099 --> 02:27:40,768
Is that clear?
Do you understand that?

2261
02:27:43,605 --> 02:27:46,399
Does he really expect us
to shoot college kids?

2262
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:48,275
You're damned right.

2263
02:27:48,276 --> 02:27:50,444
Their snipers will hit you
without batting an eye.

2264
02:27:50,445 --> 02:27:53,448
Pardon me for sounding stupid,

2265
02:27:53,448 --> 02:27:55,408
but, uh, what are we
shooting them for?

2266
02:27:58,328 --> 02:28:02,828
H'

2267
02:28:20,809 --> 02:28:22,977
the medicine failed.

2268
02:28:22,977 --> 02:28:24,520
Those bullets are killing you.

2269
02:28:36,991 --> 02:28:40,452
Grandfather said it's because
you didn't respect your vision.

2270
02:28:40,453 --> 02:28:44,415
You acted the same way after
as you did before.

2271
02:28:56,261 --> 02:28:59,389
Grandfather is right.

2272
02:28:59,389 --> 02:29:01,516
But we still
have to stop them,

2273
02:29:01,516 --> 02:29:05,353
because they're going
to try to kill Jean.

2274
02:29:11,651 --> 02:29:15,112
Will any of you help me?

2275
02:29:16,239 --> 02:29:19,158
Please. I can't do it alone.

2276
02:29:26,749 --> 02:29:28,292
Ah!

2277
02:29:42,223 --> 02:29:43,474
Let's burn their supply shack.

2278
02:29:51,107 --> 02:29:53,234
Have any of you guys
seen Danny?

2279
02:29:53,234 --> 02:29:55,194
Please, have any
of you seen Danny?

2280
02:29:55,195 --> 02:29:56,905
- No.
- Yeah, I think I saw him

2281
02:29:56,905 --> 02:29:58,698
running back towards
the girls' dorm.

2282
02:29:58,698 --> 02:29:59,532
Thank you

2283
02:30:03,786 --> 02:30:05,370
has Danny been through here?

2284
02:30:05,371 --> 02:30:06,705
- You mean little Danny?
- Yes.

2285
02:30:06,706 --> 02:30:09,333
Yeah, well, I think I saw him
go down to the bonfire.

2286
02:30:12,587 --> 02:30:13,921
Carol, you can't
go down there.

2287
02:30:13,922 --> 02:30:16,049
I have to.
I have to find Danny.

2288
02:30:16,049 --> 02:30:17,216
Carol, please.

2289
02:30:22,388 --> 02:30:23,972
Now they've set
a shack on fire.

2290
02:30:23,973 --> 02:30:27,393
You better send a fire truck and
more men to push them back.

2291
02:30:27,393 --> 02:30:28,394
Right. Over.

2292
02:30:51,960 --> 02:30:55,129
Form your lines. Form
your lines, gentlemen.

2293
02:30:55,129 --> 02:30:57,297
This is Jean Roberts
at the freedom school.

2294
02:30:57,298 --> 02:31:00,092
I have urgent information
that can stop all this.

2295
02:31:00,093 --> 02:31:02,261
Tell the governor he's got
to get on the phone now.

2296
02:31:05,932 --> 02:31:07,433
Wasn't that a sniper?

2297
02:31:07,433 --> 02:31:08,851
Sure looks like it.

2298
02:31:08,851 --> 02:31:11,770
Well, why didn't you
fire back?

2299
02:31:11,771 --> 02:31:13,439
I'm not doing anything
until I get my orders.

2300
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:15,107
Why don't you just go call
an ambulance.

2301
02:31:16,484 --> 02:31:18,652
Governor?

2302
02:31:18,653 --> 02:31:20,821
Yes. Any kind of statement
from you

2303
02:31:20,822 --> 02:31:22,365
will calm things
down considerably.

2304
02:31:24,158 --> 02:31:26,201
Would you please let me go out
and tell them anything?

2305
02:31:26,202 --> 02:31:27,870
Anything direct from you?

2306
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:30,664
If the students draw back,

2307
02:31:30,665 --> 02:31:33,000
and seal themselves
in the dormitory,

2308
02:31:33,001 --> 02:31:35,461
then I'll pull back
the militia.

2309
02:31:35,461 --> 02:31:38,672
If not, we'll stop this
at all costs.

2310
02:31:38,673 --> 02:31:40,633
Well, you pull back
your militia

2311
02:31:40,633 --> 02:31:41,842
and I'll get the kids inside.

2312
02:31:41,843 --> 02:31:44,011
God above, at least
give me that chance.

2313
02:31:54,814 --> 02:31:57,024
- Have you seen Danny?
- No, I've been with joanne.

2314
02:31:57,025 --> 02:31:59,068
Try the playground,
I'll try the barn.

2315
02:31:59,068 --> 02:32:00,986
He's probably
down with his burro.

2316
02:32:02,572 --> 02:32:04,407
General, there is a sniper.

2317
02:32:04,407 --> 02:32:06,492
Lieutenant stowe, take
your squad around the hill

2318
02:32:06,492 --> 02:32:08,035
to the other side of that wall

2319
02:32:08,036 --> 02:32:09,370
and see if you can find
that sniper.

2320
02:32:09,370 --> 02:32:09,953
Yes, sir.

2321
02:32:09,954 --> 02:32:11,538
What kind of buck shot
are you using?

2322
02:32:11,539 --> 02:32:12,206
Double ought.

2323
02:32:12,206 --> 02:32:14,082
That's equivalent
to a .38 caliber, sir.

2324
02:32:14,083 --> 02:32:16,376
I know what it's equivalent
to but if it will kill a deer,

2325
02:32:16,377 --> 02:32:17,586
it will kill those bastards.

2326
02:32:27,555 --> 02:32:32,055
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

2327
02:32:49,702 --> 02:32:51,203
Hendrick, fire a warning shot.

2328
02:32:52,872 --> 02:32:54,832
What the hell was that?

2329
02:32:57,251 --> 02:33:00,003
The sniper, he's firing at us.

2330
02:33:05,843 --> 02:33:07,261
God, they're
really shooting at us.

2331
02:33:07,261 --> 02:33:09,554
This is sergeant tibbs
at the north wall.

2332
02:33:09,555 --> 02:33:11,139
<i>Being fired on by a sniper.</i>

2333
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:12,474
<i>One man's been hit. Over.</i>

2334
02:33:12,475 --> 02:33:14,059
They're firing
on all sides, sir.

2335
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:16,395
Damn it to hell, return fire.

2336
02:33:16,396 --> 02:33:18,856
All state troopers.
Fire at will.

2337
02:34:03,985 --> 02:34:07,279
Danny?

2338
02:34:16,456 --> 02:34:20,956
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.

2339
02:34:21,961 --> 02:34:24,421
Stop it!

2340
02:34:31,637 --> 02:34:32,846
Carol.

2341
02:34:32,847 --> 02:34:35,683
What the hell
are you waiting for?

2342
02:34:35,683 --> 02:34:38,352
Come on, move it.

2343
02:34:39,771 --> 02:34:41,355
Not in the damn air, mister.

2344
02:34:41,355 --> 02:34:44,441
Down into the crowd. Now.

2345
02:34:46,569 --> 02:34:47,194
Carol?

2346
02:34:58,998 --> 02:35:03,168
Danny? Danny?

2347
02:35:27,276 --> 02:35:30,529
Please someone help me!

2348
02:35:36,202 --> 02:35:37,828
Please help!

2349
02:35:51,634 --> 02:35:52,885
What the hell?

2350
02:35:59,183 --> 02:36:01,185
Colonel, what's going on
down there?

2351
02:36:03,938 --> 02:36:07,691
Help me!

2352
02:37:04,749 --> 02:37:07,001
Under authority
of the treaty of 1868,

2353
02:37:07,001 --> 02:37:10,421
I am arresting you for being
illegally on Indian land.

2354
02:37:11,505 --> 02:37:14,299
If you resist, or if you
want to continue

2355
02:37:14,300 --> 02:37:16,969
this senseless slaughter
of these unarmed students

2356
02:37:16,969 --> 02:37:20,138
who are here
under our protection,

2357
02:37:20,139 --> 02:37:22,307
then you'll have to shoot
your way through us.

2358
02:37:22,308 --> 02:37:24,893
This is a monumental step
you're taking.

2359
02:37:24,894 --> 02:37:27,897
You give us no other choice.

2360
02:37:27,897 --> 02:37:31,984
If this country must have
another civil war,

2361
02:37:31,984 --> 02:37:33,819
then let it start here.

2362
02:37:33,819 --> 02:37:36,321
What the hell is he doing?

2363
02:38:27,415 --> 02:38:29,083
All right.

2364
02:38:29,083 --> 02:38:30,876
I'll notify the governor.

2365
02:38:38,884 --> 02:38:41,511
Somebody help us, please.

2366
02:38:50,938 --> 02:38:52,606
No, we're pulling out.

2367
02:38:52,606 --> 02:38:55,400
You should have been here
tonight, old buddy.

2368
02:38:55,401 --> 02:38:56,902
We got a couple of them.

2369
02:39:13,377 --> 02:39:16,129
It's funny.

2370
02:39:16,130 --> 02:39:18,465
I thought the freedom school

2371
02:39:18,466 --> 02:39:22,303
was a symbol of everything
good and right

2372
02:39:22,303 --> 02:39:24,221
in the American spirit.

2373
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:32,350
We had kids
of different races,

2374
02:39:32,813 --> 02:39:36,316
ideologies, religions,

2375
02:39:36,317 --> 02:39:39,570
all living and working
together in peace and Harmony.

2376
02:39:47,578 --> 02:39:49,621
For all the kids
at the school,

2377
02:39:49,622 --> 02:39:51,790
we really want you back.

2378
02:39:54,126 --> 02:39:55,752
Aren't you going to
open it again?

2379
02:39:57,797 --> 02:40:01,550
It's not the kids.

2380
02:40:01,550 --> 02:40:03,843
It's the townspeople.

2381
02:40:03,844 --> 02:40:06,972
They not only supported
the shooting,

2382
02:40:06,972 --> 02:40:09,140
but if you can believe it,

2383
02:40:09,141 --> 02:40:11,643
they were actually happy
about it.

2384
02:40:34,458 --> 02:40:35,834
What do they think?

2385
02:40:35,835 --> 02:40:37,253
Will he come back
or is he dead yet?

2386
02:40:37,253 --> 02:40:40,047
No, not yet.

2387
02:40:40,047 --> 02:40:43,216
Some of the old men say that
he's lost the will to live.

2388
02:40:43,217 --> 02:40:45,135
Go see if you can find Jean
and get her up here.

2389
02:40:58,566 --> 02:40:59,692
You have not learned enough

2390
02:40:59,692 --> 02:41:01,777
to come over
to this side permanently.

2391
02:41:01,986 --> 02:41:05,280
Why? My spirit progresses
so poorly on the other side.

2392
02:41:06,157 --> 02:41:08,367
That's because you don't value
your visions.

2393
02:41:08,367 --> 02:41:11,078
You must carefully listen
to them and change your life

2394
02:41:11,078 --> 02:41:13,371
according to what they say.

2395
02:41:13,372 --> 02:41:15,248
I understand that.

2396
02:41:15,249 --> 02:41:17,000
But why can't I do that here?

2397
02:41:17,168 --> 02:41:20,421
You must go back, for when
people can see how someone

2398
02:41:20,421 --> 02:41:24,258
as violent as you can change
and find inner peace,

2399
02:41:24,258 --> 02:41:26,718
then you will set
a good example.

2400
02:41:26,719 --> 02:41:29,930
After you have gone back
and practiced the fourth way,

2401
02:41:30,139 --> 02:41:32,474
then you will meet
your spiritual guide.

2402
02:41:32,474 --> 02:41:34,392
Well, how am I supposed
to do that?

2403
02:41:34,393 --> 02:41:36,770
I don't even know
what the fourth way is.

2404
02:41:36,770 --> 02:41:38,646
My friend will tell you.

2405
02:41:38,647 --> 02:41:41,441
But you will not be able
to reach the fourth way

2406
02:41:41,442 --> 02:41:43,819
until you stop covering
your weaknesses

2407
02:41:43,819 --> 02:41:45,612
with violent acts.

2408
02:41:45,613 --> 02:41:47,615
The fourth and highest level
is when,

2409
02:41:47,615 --> 02:41:49,325
no matter what
they do to your body

2410
02:41:49,325 --> 02:41:51,702
they cannot touch your soul,

2411
02:41:51,702 --> 02:41:53,995
because you are so deeply
into your own center.

2412
02:41:53,996 --> 02:41:56,039
Then you see violence
and anger

2413
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:57,916
and bullying
not as threats,

2414
02:41:57,917 --> 02:42:00,210
but as cover-ups used
by panicked men

2415
02:42:00,211 --> 02:42:02,129
who are
frightened and in pain.

2416
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:05,007
Instead of hating them

2417
02:42:05,007 --> 02:42:06,925
you truly feel sorry
for their weakness,

2418
02:42:06,926 --> 02:42:09,720
and can easily turn and offer
them your other cheek.

2419
02:42:11,931 --> 02:42:15,142
Now go back and do
what you must do.

2420
02:42:15,142 --> 02:42:16,810
And take Carol,

2421
02:42:16,810 --> 02:42:18,978
for she will help you carry on
the teachings.

2422
02:42:41,168 --> 02:42:43,962
How are all the kids?

2423
02:42:43,963 --> 02:42:46,674
I don't know.

2424
02:42:46,674 --> 02:42:49,343
I haven't been back there yet.

2425
02:42:49,343 --> 02:42:51,011
What do you mean you haven't
been back there?

2426
02:42:51,011 --> 02:42:54,848
You mean you, you haven't been
back to the school?

2427
02:42:54,848 --> 02:42:56,474
Why not?

2428
02:42:57,184 --> 02:42:58,435
Don't they need your help

2429
02:42:58,435 --> 02:43:00,019
getting the whole thing
started again?

2430
02:43:01,021 --> 02:43:03,106
You mean you really want to
go through all that again?

2431
02:43:05,859 --> 02:43:07,277
Are you telling me
you're quitting?

2432
02:43:10,823 --> 02:43:12,157
Look over there.

2433
02:43:28,465 --> 02:43:30,592
Well, that's a strong sign.

2434
02:43:32,052 --> 02:43:33,887
That doesn't change
your mind at all?

2435
02:43:44,815 --> 02:43:46,441
Tomorrow, all over the world

2436
02:43:46,442 --> 02:43:48,193
kids are going to march
to rebuild the school.

2437
02:43:49,528 --> 02:43:52,072
We're going to try to start
other schools, all over,

2438
02:43:52,072 --> 02:43:53,907
just like you've done
for us here.

2439
02:43:54,158 --> 02:43:56,201
Instead of stopping
the exposes,

2440
02:43:56,201 --> 02:43:58,453
we've got to work harder now
than ever.

2441
02:43:58,454 --> 02:44:01,206
With Ford and rockefeller,
nothing will really change.

2442
02:44:01,206 --> 02:44:03,917
Everyone suddenly forgot
about all the urgent reforms

2443
02:44:03,917 --> 02:44:05,627
<i>so we've got to keep on
fighting</i>

2444
02:44:05,627 --> 02:44:07,337
until those reforms
really happen.

2445
02:44:08,547 --> 02:44:11,007
We've all decided.
Everybody.

2446
02:44:11,592 --> 02:44:13,260
We're going to dedicate
the march to you.

2447
02:44:14,053 --> 02:44:16,180
Please come in.

2448
02:44:32,321 --> 02:44:33,572
Ii'
