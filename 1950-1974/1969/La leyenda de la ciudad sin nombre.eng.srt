00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,712
Gold

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,598
Got a dream, boy
Got a song

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,713
Paint your wagon
And come along

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,829
Where am I goin'? I don't know
Where am I headin'? I ain't certain

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,358
All I know is I am on my way

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,158
When will I be there? I don't know

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,231
When will I get there?
I ain't certain

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,359
All I know is I am on my way

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,396
Got a dream, boy
Got a song

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,391
Paint your wagon

15
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,270
Got a dream, boy
Got a song

16
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,558
Paint your wagon
And come along

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,278
Where am I goin'? I don't know

18
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,191
When will I be there?
I ain't certain

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,397
What will I get?
I ain't equipped to say

20
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,473
But who gives a damn?
Who gives a damn?

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,155
Who gives a damn? We're on our way

22
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,835
Where am I goin'? I don't know
Where am I headin'? I ain't certain

23
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,278
All I know is I am on my way

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,157
When will I be there? I don't know

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,037
When will I get there?
I ain't certain

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,592
All I know is I am on my way

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,309
Where am I goin'? I don't know
Where am I headin'? I ain't certain

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,188
All I know is I am on my way

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,918
When will I be there? I don't know

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,831
When will I get there?
I ain't certain

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,835
All I know is I am on my way

32
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,390
Got a dream, boy
Got a song

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,712
Paint your wagon
And come along

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,597
Where am I goin'? I don't know

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,432
When will I be there?
I ain't certain

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,557
What will I get?
I ain't equipped to say

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,077
But who gives a damn?
Who gives a damn? We're...

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,717
Farmers. Let's go.

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,588
Hold it. There it is!

40
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,510
Get over here. Now stop it!

41
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,989
Hello!

42
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,475
Is they dead?

43
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,709
They'd better be,

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,509
cos I'm gonna bury 'em!

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,238
Let's go.

46
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,916
My brother.

47
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,077
My brother.

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,435
He's dead.

49
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,436
His shoulder and leg
is pretty badly broken.

50
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,273
- You a doctor?
- Horse doctor.

51
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,432
But bones is bones.
Also a blacksmith.

52
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,036
Bring brother.

53
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,197
More in the centre.

54
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,468
God, we pass on to you

55
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,838
the body and soul
of this nameless peckerhead.

56
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,799
At least he went quick,
and he ain't going to suffer scurvy,

57
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,678
the dysentery,
spotted fever or the cholera

58
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,117
not to mention other maladies
contracted in consort with low women.

59
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,472
Or waste years digging in the dirt
and finding dirt, like I have.

60
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,916
- Talk about him!
- You wanna be next?

61
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,878
And seeing how he survived all that,
he could have been hit by timber,

62
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,555
fall down a shaft,
starved, get murdered

63
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,269
or committed suicide
on Christmas Eve.

64
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,593
What I mean, God, is you have
no pity for your living children,

65
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,432
so that's why we're asking you

66
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,990
to be a little kinder
to them when they're dead.

67
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,036
So, with all due reverence, Lord,

68
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,591
we pass on to you
this corncracker's body and soul

69
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,114
to take him and to keep him...

70
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,318
I stake this claim for me and my
new pardner, whatever his name is...

71
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,233
Forever and ever. Amen.

72
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,311
Pull him up.

73
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,837
Got a dream, boy
Got a song

74
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,391
Paint your wagon
And come along

75
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,597
Where am I goin'? I don't know

76
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,636
Where am I headin'?
I ain't certain

77
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,272
All I know is I am on my way

78
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,157
When will I be there? I don't know

79
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,231
When will I get there?
I ain't certain

80
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,551
All I know is I am on my way

81
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,315
Got a dream, boy
Got a song

82
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,439
Paint your wagon
And come along

83
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,437
Where am I goin'? I don't know

84
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,431
When will I be there?
I ain't certain

85
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,796
What will I get?
I ain't equipped to say

86
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,668
But who gives a damn?
Who gives a damn?

87
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,389
We're on our way

88
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,551
I still see Elisa

89
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,349
She keeps on returning

90
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,639
As breathless
And young as ever

91
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,149
I still hear Elisa

92
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,789
And still feel a yearning

93
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,637
To hold her against me again

94
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,992
Her heart was made of holidays

95
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,915
Her smile was made of dawn

96
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,278
Her laughter was an April song

97
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,956
That echoes on and on

98
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,831
Since I saw Elisa

99
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,708
The shadows are falling

100
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,636
And winter is calling above

101
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,352
But I still see Elisa

102
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,910
Whenever I dream

103
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,992
Of love

104
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,509
- Elisa. That the name of your girl?
- Yeah.

105
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,115
I found this. I thought
it might make a good crutch

106
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,668
now that you seem to be
getting around good.

107
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,876
Thanks.

108
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,390
It just don't seem right, Mr Rumson.

109
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,950
You doing all the work
and me getting half.

110
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,032
I mean, it's your mule,
your tools and all.

111
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,430
- It was your brother.
- Well...

112
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,955
Where I come from, we're cautious of
strangers who talk in an easy manner.

113
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,390
You got me down for some kind
of low scuff from New Orleans?

114
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,594
Sell you patent medicine
with one hand,

115
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,194
pinch your purse with the other?

116
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,396
That's what I was thinking.

117
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,270
Actually, you're right, but
I ain't yet sunk to horse stealing.

118
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,629
I've salted claims, yeah.
And I've sold whisky to Injuns.

119
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,757
Once a man come at me with a gun,
and I killed him.

120
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,832
I can't think of one commandment
I ain't shattered.

121
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,836
I never did fancy my parents,
let alone respect or honour them,

122
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,354
and I have coveted
my neighbour's wife...

123
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,750
Whenever I had a neighbour
and whenever he had a wife.

124
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,272
And I gamble and I cheat at cards,
but there is one thing I do not do.

125
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,989
I ain't never gulled a pardner.

126
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,915
The one sacred thing, even to low
scuff like me, is a man's pardner.

127
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,714
Two pennyweight short
of four ounces.

128
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,998
Pass me your pouch,
I'll pour your share.

129
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,312
And, Pardner, I'll swap pouches
with you anytime you say.

130
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,477
I meant no offence, and I appreciate
you saving my life and all.

131
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,676
But what's expected in return?

132
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,309
That's right. I like to know
what crops I'm planting.

133
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,518
When I get dead drunk,
fall in a muddy street,

134
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,195
I expect you to come get me,
cos I don't want to die muddy drunk.

135
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,556
If I owe a man $100,
stand good for me,

136
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,473
and if I get melancholy,
which can happen,

137
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,757
I expect you to be
my companion and solace me.

138
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,190
What happens when you
get in a fight?

139
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,068
If four of anything come at me
at one time, you might lend a fist.

140
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,073
Up until that,
I can take care of myself.

141
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,197
You see, I don't fight fair.

142
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,674
Well, I don't fight at all
unless I absolutely have to.

143
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,117
I got kind of a temper,
and once I start, I just can't quit.

144
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,716
Well, good. Just remember
that I'm on your side.

145
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,436
I hear a shopkeeper's pulled into
town with a wagon full of whisky.

146
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,479
What do you say I hoist you
up that mule and we go get boiled?

147
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,109
I ain't a boozing man, either.

148
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,752
Well, I am.

149
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,438
Town meeting tonight! There's
gonna be a town meeting tonight!

150
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,556
Town meeting tonight, Ben.

151
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,553
- Ben! Ben Rumson!
- Mooney! This is my pardner.

152
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,599
- I thought you went back to Ireland.
- I am. I'm just passing through.

153
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,797
- It's right on the way.
- Mooney.

154
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,511
- How's it going, Willie?
- I ain't won a hand in three weeks.

155
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,989
This is my pardner.

156
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,073
He calls himself Rotten Luck Willie,
but that's just to get the suckers.

157
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,469
You can't beat him, so don't play.

158
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,030
- I don't gamble.
- Neither does he.

159
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,112
My name's Ben Rumson.
This here's my pardner.

160
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,272
And I'm buying whisky
for any man that can stand up.

161
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,874
- I was sitting there.
- Now you're standing there. Whisky!

162
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,954
Ben Rumson, you have an outstanding
account in the amount of $68

163
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,591
from Yuba City,
and which you skipped town on me.

164
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,639
Skipped town on you?
I was run out. Don't you remember?

165
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,759
I want to be paid now before
they run you out of this town.

166
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,549
Put that damn gun down
and stand these boys the whisky.

167
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,110
Dry your hands before you weigh it.
We need supplies.

168
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,794
A pound of sugar,
half a case of whisky,

169
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,475
and pneumonia
for Schermerhorn there.

170
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,473
A pound of sugar and a two pound sack
of flour, please.

171
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,156
Evening. Horace Tabor,
Worcester, Massachusetts.

172
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,037
When did you get in?

173
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,715
Arrived this morning.
Hit a vein this afternoon,

174
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,314
and I aim to be back
in Worcester by Christmas.

175
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,552
It says here California's
going to be admitted to the Union.

176
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,153
Just what it needs... law and order.

177
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,515
- That's good news.
- Well, it ain't to me.

178
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,832
It's my policy to bust out of any
territory the day it become a state

179
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,833
- and head for the wilderness.
- I don't agree, sir.

180
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,038
You look around the human race,
you wonder what was God thinking.

181
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,559
God made the mountains
God made the sky

182
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,998
God made the people
God knows why

183
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,279
He fixed up the planet
As best as he could

184
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,030
Then in come the people
And gum it up good

185
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,955
The first thing ya know

186
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,630
They civilise the foothills
And everywhere he put hills

187
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,314
The mountains and valleys below

188
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,756
They come along and take 'em
And civilise and make 'em

189
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,196
A place where
No civilised person would go

190
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,348
The first thing you know
The first thing you know

191
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,277
They civilise what's pretty
By puttin' up a city

192
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,079
Where nothin'
That's pretty can grow

193
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,639
They muddy up the winter

194
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,714
And civilise it into
A place too uncivilised even for snow

195
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,831
The first thing ya know

196
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,593
They civilise left
They civilise right

197
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,717
Till nothin' is left
Till nothin' is right

198
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,110
They civilise freedom
till no one is free

199
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,113
No one except
By coincidence, me

200
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,756
The first thing ya know

201
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,437
The boozer's in prison
And the criminal, he isn't

202
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,114
And only the rascals have dough

203
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,670
When I see a parson
I gotta put my arse in

204
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,036
The wagon that follows
the tail of a crow

205
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,830
The first thing ya know
I pick up and blow

206
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,277
The first thing you know

207
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,749
Ben Rumson!

208
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,958
You bloody old rumpot!

209
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,395
Mad Jack Duncan! This is my pardner.

210
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,311
I heard you was in town.

211
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,631
Wait till I tell you what happened
to Harry and Ernest and me.

212
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,950
- What?
- We never went home.

213
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,713
We're having a dance. Jump in!

214
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,394
Climb on, Pardner.
We're going to a dance!

215
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,276
Out the window go the beans
Out the window go the beans

216
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,716
Out the window go the beans
I had a lucky day

217
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,555
Mary, my Mary
My sweet canary

218
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,870
We're goin' out this evenin'

219
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,717
Mary, my Mary
I'm gonna take you out tonight

220
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,190
So hand me down that can o' beans
Hand me down that can o' beans

221
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,910
Hand me down that can o' beans
I'm throwin' it away

222
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,231
Out the window go the beans
Out the window go the beans

223
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,029
Out the window go the beans

224
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,873
Good times are here to stay

225
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,475
This town meeting
will now come to order!

226
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,191
Hand me down that can o' beans
Hand me down that can o' beans

227
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,636
Hand me down that can o' beans

228
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,508
Out the window go the beans
Out the window go the beans

229
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,876
Out the window go the beans
I had a lucky day

230
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,476
Mary, Mary
My cute canary

231
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,028
We're goin' out this evenin'

232
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,752
Mary, Mary
I'm gonna take you out tonight

233
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,756
So hand me down
that can o' beans...

234
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,512
Order!

235
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,876
Hand me down that can o' beans
I'm throwin' it away

236
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,316
Out the window go the beans
Out the window go the beans

237
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,949
Out the window go the beans
Go the beans, go the beans

238
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,713
Good times are here to stay

239
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,950
Hand me down that can o' beans
Hand me down that can o' beans

240
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,555
Hand me down that can o' beans
I'm throwin' it away

241
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,076
Out the window go the beans
Out the window go the beans

242
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,550
Out the window go the beans
I had a lucky day

243
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,156
Mary, Mary
My sweet canary

244
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,708
We're goin' out this evenin'

245
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,397
Mary, Mary
I'm gonna take you out tonight

246
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,390
So hand me down that can o' beans

247
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,836
Hand me down that can o' beans
Hand me down that can o' beans

248
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,956
I'm throwin' it away

249
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,316
Out the window go the beans
Out the window go the beans

250
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,154
Out the window go the beans
Go the beans, go the beans

251
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,879
Good times are here to stay

252
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,676
- Anybody seen Ben Rumson?
- He left here about 20 minutes ago.

253
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,957
- Thanks.
- Are you his pardner?

254
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,999
He owes me $80.
He said you would stand good.

255
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,471
Pardner.

256
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,675
- Can you help me get up on the mule?
- You all right?

257
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,351
I get melancholy every now and then.

258
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,035
It's a disease common to
mountain men who live alone a lot,

259
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,910
but if you stay with me such times,
I'll be OK.

260
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,991
All right.

261
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,239
Did Ezra Atwell come to you
for that $80?

262
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,439
Yeah. I stood good for you.

263
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,752
I guess this is what you meant,
when you said you expected me

264
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,718
to come get you
muddy drunk in the street.

265
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,395
And now you're gonna be my companion
in my moment of despair.

266
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,709
- Well, you're my pardner, ain't you?
- I like you, Pardner.

267
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,476
I like you, Ben.

268
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,349
My mother and father's dead,

269
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,198
and my two brothers and myself,
we worked the farm.

270
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,671
Then last year, my older brother,
he took himself a wife.

271
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,914
Me and my kid brother decided
to leave Michigan and come out here,

272
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,834
maybe dig some gold,
get enough money to buy some land.

273
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,998
Except now that he's gone, I don't
have too much appetite for farming.

274
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,316
What about your girl?

275
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,398
- Girl?
- Yeah. Elisa.

276
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,519
Is she gonna come out and join you,
or did she marry your brother?

277
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,793
To tell you the truth,
there is no Elisa.

278
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,155
I just read that name somewhere
and made it up.

279
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,439
Them's the best kind, but
what I need now is the worst kind.

280
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,319
It's a living hell up here,
what with the bloody rain

281
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,076
and the bloody loneliness,
and that bloody, bloody wind.

282
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,799
Maria, Maria

283
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,714
They call the wind Maria

284
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,710
Away out here they got a name
For rain and wind and fire

285
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,758
The rain is Tess
The fire's Joe

286
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,550
And they call the wind Maria

287
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,954
Maria blows the stars around
And sends the clouds a-flyin'

288
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,350
Maria makes the mountains sound

289
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,558
Like folks were up there dyin'

290
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:36,795
Maria, Maria

291
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,273
They call the wind Maria

292
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,471
Before I knew Maria's name
And heard her wail and whinin'

293
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,075
I had a girl and she had me
And the sun was always shinin'

294
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,349
But then one day I left my girl
I left her far behind me

295
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,228
And now I'm lost
So goldurn lost

296
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,075
Not even God can find me

297
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,870
Maria, Maria

298
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,954
They call the wind Maria

299
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,429
Out here they got a name for rain
For wind and fire only

300
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,834
But when you're lost and all alone
There ain't no word but lonely

301
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,749
And I'm a lost and lonely man
Without a star to guide me

302
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,118
Maria, blow my love to me

303
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,991
I need my girl beside me

304
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,795
Maria, Maria

305
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,590
They call the wind Maria

306
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,550
Maria, Maria

307
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,310
Blow my love

308
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,270
To me

309
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,348
Women! Look at the women!

310
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,589
Look! Two women!
Look at the two women!

311
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,559
There's five women!
I wanna get one of them gals!

312
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,555
Women! Women!

313
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,909
There's 64 women coming into town!

314
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,358
Men, 80 women coming down the river!

315
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,319
Lady, I got $50 here in gold dust.

316
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,039
You can have it all
if you let me hold the baby.

317
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,234
Very well.
No, I don't want your money for it.

318
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,551
You'll hurt his feelings,
Sarah. Take it.

319
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,079
Look at them eyes,
glowing like he just hit pay dirt.

320
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,355
He's a girl, you bummer!

321
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,035
Would anyone else
care to hold the baby?

322
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,193
- Not now, Jacob.
- Just where are you people from?

323
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,272
Illinois, originally.
I'm Jacob Woodling.

324
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,354
- This is my wife Sarah.
- And who is this fine young lady?

325
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,238
- Her name is Elizabeth Woodling.
- Your sister?

326
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,550
No. My wife.

327
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,478
Your wife?
I thought that one was your wife.

328
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,599
- They both are.
- Holy Moses! They're Mormons!

329
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,036
- Du lieber Himmel!
- Nice work, old man!

330
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,477
- Can we get something to eat there?
- With $50, you can, sir. Follow me.

331
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,395
- What the hell is a Mormons?
- Ich weiß nicht.

332
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,996
Bridegroom,
I don't give a damn how a man prays.

333
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,471
There's room in hell for all of us,
but it just ain't equitable,

334
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,792
for you to be having two of
something all of us got none of.

335
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,631
So I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

336
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,397
Your mule's lame,
and I got a beauty that cost me $140.

337
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,439
I'll swap you straight,
my mule for one of your wives.

338
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,432
Now, which one's baby's mother?

339
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,956
God knows I wouldn't want
to separate mother and child.

340
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,510
- I am.
- Good. I fancied t'other one, I did.

341
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,398
- This is immoral.
- I hope so!

342
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,711
- The woman's married.
- No, she's not!

343
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,713
We don't recognise plural marriage
in California.

344
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,076
Then I bid $250 in gold for her.

345
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,116
- 260!
- 265!

346
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,794
Wait!
You can't buy a woman for money.

347
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,996
Try and get one without it.

348
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,154
All right, what about it, Mormons?

349
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,629
Jacob, we need every penny,

350
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,871
and I can't bear another day
of those martyred looks.

351
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,431
- There it is again.
- This ain't a martyred look, Sarah.

352
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,398
This look is pure hatred.

353
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,277
Quiet! Brigham Young has 27 wives,

354
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,557
and he hasn't had
half the trouble with them.

355
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,513
Then simplify your life, Jacob.
Sell me.

356
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,871
But, Elizabeth,
you don't know what you'll get.

357
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,633
I know what I've had.

358
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,718
- Go ahead, Jacob.
- Gentlemen...

359
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,872
Out here I ain't a Mormon.

360
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,510
Elizabeth is a headstrong woman,

361
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,354
especially since
her own baby died two weeks ago,

362
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,431
but she's given
her consent to be sold.

363
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,150
Therefore, if any of you
want to bid for her, so be it.

364
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,995
But let's go outside,
where there's room for more people.

365
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,396
But these religious dogs
are bloody greedy! Come on! Come on!

366
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,072
You wait here and feed the baby.

367
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,594
It's not proper
you standing on a block.

368
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,195
If anyone wants to inspect you
I'll send them in.

369
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,751
Order! Order!

370
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,079
I intend to conduct this auction
in an orderly manner!

371
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:26,837
And no bids in Spanish. The last bid
was $265 and two blankets.

372
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,151
$265, two blankets and a jackass!

373
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,119
A two-pound sack of coffee,
a two-pound sack of brown sugar...

374
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,113
Holbrook, even if she is bought,
how will she marry who bought her?

375
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,113
She'll be married by the
prevailing law of this community,

376
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,911
which is mining law, and she will be
treated like any other legal claim!

377
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,557
Order! Order! Order!

378
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,591
Order! The man bids $275,

379
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,595
four blankets, one pickaxe
and a bedpan.

380
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,279
Mooney, there's a woman in the saloon

381
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,032
with a baby
pressed against her breast.

382
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,519
That's right.

383
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,354
Wait. It ain't every day
that we got a woman in Atwell's

384
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,557
- pressing her breast with her baby.
- That's right.

385
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,351
Clendennon,

386
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,591
there's a woman in Atwell's
pressing her breast to the saloon.

387
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,796
I know, and we're bidding for her.

388
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,078
Sam Fletcher bids $300,
four blankets...

389
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,275
Ben, where you going?

390
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,273
There's a breast in Atwell's
pressing a woman against her.

391
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,874
You better stay here.

392
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,116
- Look! There's another one!
- He's a Mormon. He has two wives.

393
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,192
- I'll kill him.
- They're bidding on her now.

394
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,400
What's the bid?
Whatever the bid is, I double it!

395
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,360
$400 was bid last!

396
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,709
Mr Ben Rumson gallantly
doubles that bid to $800!

397
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,797
800 once...

398
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,190
Wait! I'm his pardner,
and he withdraws the bid.

399
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,874
- You have power of attorney?
- Power of what?

400
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,793
Written permission,
signed and witnessed.

401
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,678
If he could do that,
he'd talk for himself.

402
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,311
- 800 twice!
- Wake up, Ben. Come on.

403
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,633
Sold to Mr Ben Rumson for $800!

404
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,831
He only looks that way
when he's drunk.

405
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,832
You ain't exactly
seein' him at his best,

406
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,673
but once I get him
washed down and clipped,

407
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,718
I think you'll be
agreeably surprised.

408
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,959
Get the soap and water

409
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,198
Get the soap and water

410
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,670
Got a sweet perfumer
To try his humour

411
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,911
It's Ben's weddin' day

412
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,833
Wash him down and clip him

413
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,112
Wash him down and clip him

414
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,715
He's got a blue-eyed wonder
To put him under

415
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,830
It's his weddin', Ben's weddin'
Ben's weddin' day

416
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,434
Where am I goin'?
I don't know

417
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,197
Where am I headin'?
I ain't certain

418
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,391
All I know is I am on my way

419
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,713
Amen

420
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,153
Dearly beloved,

421
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,949
we have gathered together
to grant this man, Ben Rumson,

422
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,192
exclusive title to this woman,
Mrs Elizabeth Woodling,

423
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,919
and to all her mineral resources.

424
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,389
I have drawn up this record of claim,

425
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,392
which here and henceforth
will be recognised

426
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,311
as a certificate of marriage.

427
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,278
So I ask you, Ben,

428
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,148
do you recognise this claim
as a contract of marriage,

429
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,756
and do you take this woman
to love, honour and cherish?

430
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,475
He does.

431
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,633
Elizabeth Woodling,
do you take this man, Ben Rumson,

432
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,032
to love, honour, and obey him
until death do you part?

433
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,673
She does.

434
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,154
I now pronounce you claimed and filed
as Mr and Mrs Ben Rumson.

435
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,873
Mr Rumson went to town
Ridin' on a pony

436
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,714
Bought a wife and brought her home
And called it matrimony

437
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,229
Mr Rumson bought a bride
Out in Californy

438
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,438
He'd have saved a lot of money
Stayin' drunk and horny

439
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,119
Oh, Susannah
He's happy as can be

440
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,034
For he's got him somethin' better
Than a banjo on his knee

441
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,793
Rumson, he got married today
Married today, married today

442
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,192
Rumson, he got married today
What'll he do tomorrow?

443
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,474
Ben! I'll be glad
to help you work your claim!

444
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,315
I'll be bedding down
by the fire if you need me.

445
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,599
You'll not regret taking me in,
I'll make you a good wife.

446
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,390
You sure as hell will.

447
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,598
I don't fault you
for taking me for an easy woman.

448
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,035
I was bought and paid for.

449
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,157
But you bought me for a wife,
not a whore.

450
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,279
If you come again at me again like
a slavering dog, I'll shoot you!

451
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,476
Watch where you point that thing.

452
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,030
You'd blow my manhood
halfway to the moon.

453
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,033
I mean to make you a good wife and
honour this contract of marriage,

454
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,839
but only if you
will honour it as well.

455
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,911
I don't know
what you mean by honour it.

456
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,200
I know your sort of man.

457
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,434
My father was the same sort,
born under a wandering star.

458
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,911
I ain't fool enough to bond you
with all the tyrannies of marriage.

459
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,468
All I want is your name, Mr Rumson,

460
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,678
and the least measure
of respect due to a man's wife.

461
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,231
But most of all,

462
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,878
I want you to build me a cabin.

463
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,877
A cabin that'll stand up
in winter with a fireplace of stone

464
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,191
and a door I can bolt if I have to.

465
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,428
And if you do that, I will say
you have honoured the contract.

466
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,751
But if you regret having bought me,
say so now.

467
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,118
And if I have to work forever,
I'll see you get your $800 back.

468
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,509
I admire your pioneer spirit and
your straightforward manner.

469
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,911
- Is that what you've been admiring?
- I've been admiring you.

470
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,193
All right, I'll build you a cabin,
and I'll give you my name proudly.

471
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,959
You're Mrs Ben Rumson, and I'll kill
any man that says you ain't,

472
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,350
and I'll stick to it till I move on,

473
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,353
which is when the gold pinches out
or the first snow of winter.

474
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,274
You ain't gonna claim duress later
just cos I held a gun on you?

475
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,433
No, ma'am,
I ain't going to claim duress.

476
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,796
I seem to lack
all sense of shame with you.

477
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,311
These men came all the way from
Fiddler's Camp just to see your wife.

478
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,436
Hiya, Ben!

479
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,278
Looks like I married myself
a tourist attraction.

480
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,478
Some of these boys hiked 15 miles.
Ben, how's married life?

481
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,030
Pardner, it was so good,
I forgot that I was married.

482
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,954
I'd hike 15 miles
to look at that myself.

483
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,395
I can see it ain't gonna be easy,

484
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,517
married to the only woman
in these mountains.

485
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,672
All right, boys!
The lady wants a cabin to live in,

486
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:06,073
a proper cabin made out of wood
that'll hold up in the winter!

487
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,436
So just don't sit there gaping,
get to work!

488
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:30,030
Send back the world
There's too much night for me

489
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,956
The sky is much too high
To shelter me when darkness falls

490
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,639
Four cabin walls
Would be just right for me

491
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,597
I need a threshold I can cross

492
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,118
Where I can sit
And gather moss forevermore

493
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,837
A million miles away

494
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:04,040
Behind the door

495
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,797
Roll up the plains
There's too much view for me

496
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,393
There's so much space
Between the waiting heart

497
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,713
And whispered word
It's never heard

498
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,198
One room will do for me

499
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,034
Where every evening
I can stare at someone

500
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,752
Smiling from his chair
Across the floor

501
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:41,031
A million miles away

502
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:47,275
Behind the door

503
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,998
Where every evening
I can stare at someone

504
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,552
Smiling from his chair
Across the floor

505
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,714
A million miles away

506
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:29,033
Behind the door

507
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,750
No fears, no fools

508
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:39,709
No lies, no rules

509
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,509
Just doing with my life

510
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,354
What life is for

511
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,910
A million miles away

512
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,796
Behind the door

513
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,277
Elizabeth.

514
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,952
Elizabeth?

515
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,991
- Where have you been?
- Down at the rapids taking a bath.

516
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,516
You mean you was taking a bath?

517
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,990
I mean I was taking a bath.
What do you think I mean?

518
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:05,110
You was down at the rapids just now,
bare beam and buck naked?

519
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,636
I'm not like to take a bath
with my clothes on, Mr Rumson.

520
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,996
Are you trying to tell me
you was taking a bath?

521
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:17,234
- That's right. I was taking a bath.
- In the middle of the night?

522
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:24,589
Mr Rumson, in a community of 400 men,
would you rather I took my bath

523
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,276
bare beam and buck naked
in the middle of the day?

524
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,397
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

525
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,998
I ain't running around in the
middle of the night in my drawers.

526
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,190
Hey, boys! Listen to this.

527
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,592
"The proprietors of the
Hares and Hounds Club in Sonora

528
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,595
"wish to announce that six ladies
are expected to arrive by stage

529
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,309
"from San Francisco
on the 15th of August".

530
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,109
- How about that.
- That's a hundred miles away.

531
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,236
What good is that gonna do us?

532
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,710
Ain't no one trying
to steal your wife, Ben.

533
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,951
I'll admit there's a few
who wouldn't mind trying.

534
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,749
Horace Tabor, for instance.
He likes to give her a look.

535
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,674
- Horace Tabor?
- Come on, Ben.

536
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,230
He just looks. She doesn't
encourage him or anybody else.

537
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,551
But you're beginning
to cut a comical figure.

538
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,997
- Everybody's laughing at you.
- I would've never thought of Tabor.

539
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,476
What the hell are you looking at,
Horace Tabor?

540
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,355
I'm looking for my stirring stick.

541
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,715
You make any more
advances towards my wife,

542
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,554
and I'm gonna shoot you down
like the dog you are!

543
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,872
And the rest of you horny gorillas!
You want something to do?

544
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:24,590
Put up your money for them six
French tarts coming into Sonora!

545
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,877
But keep your lusting minds
off of my wife!

546
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:33,956
I'd advise you, Rumson,
not to refer to me as a dog again.

547
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,715
- Is that clear?
- I'll stick my fist in your ear!

548
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,031
- Why you...!
- Grab Tabor! Stop him!

549
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,156
Get back! Get ahold of him!

550
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,151
Mr Rumson!

551
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,198
- Rumson, I...
- Mr Rumson!

552
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,953
Nobody has behaved unseemly to me.

553
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,237
I have been treated with nothing
but kindness in this camp,

554
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,838
and you owe every one of these men,
especially Mr Tabor, an apology.

555
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,195
By God, you're right!

556
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:12,398
I don't know what's come over me.
I've been behaving like a damn fool,

557
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,395
and I wish to beg your communal
pardons, especially yours,

558
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,198
Horace Tabor.

559
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,909
I suppose if I was married
to the only woman

560
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,595
in the neighbourhood,
I might be just as demented.

561
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,716
And, Mrs Rumson!
May I extend my compliments?

562
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,109
You are as wise as you are fair.

563
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,476
- Get your hands off!
- That lunatic tried to kill me!

564
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:47,152
I demand a town meeting to consider
a proper course of action.

565
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:54,712
If that knife had come one inch
lower, I would not be here today.

566
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,156
- That's right.
- Fellow citizens,

567
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,997
as long as that madman
prowls among us, no one is safe.

568
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,756
Therefore, we must
find a solution by tonight.

569
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:14,631
Let us not wait until the condition
worsens or his aim improves!

570
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,031
- Thank you.
- Order!

571
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:22,399
- Mr Chairman!
- The chair recognises Ezra Atwell.

572
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,592
I would like
to ask Ben Rumson directly

573
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,877
if he doesn't think
that with a little sober effort

574
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,269
he could control
these fits of jealousy?

575
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,750
No. It's getting worse every day.
Sorry, I can't help you.

576
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,516
- The chair recognises Ben's pardner.
- Thank you, Mr Holbrook.

577
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,149
I've been giving it
some considerable thought,

578
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,949
ever since Ben Rumson,
my pardner here, poor bastard...

579
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:54,034
Excuse me, ma'am...
Well, ever since he became a lunatic.

580
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,237
What's putting the strain
on Ben's mind

581
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,357
<b>is having the only woman
for 90 miles around here.</b>

582
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,752
My proposal is that we
get some more women for this town.

583
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,354
How you gonna get women
to come up here?

584
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,831
- Order! Order!
- I know where we can get some women.

585
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,151
The six French bawds arriving
in Sonora a week Saturday.

586
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,275
You're right.

587
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,555
Let's get them
to come up here instead.

588
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,713
How? If I was a French bawd,
I'd go to Sonora.

589
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,439
If you was a French bawd,
we'd have no trouble.

590
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,715
How will we get 'em up here?

591
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,598
They gotta take the stage
from Sacramento,

592
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,353
and change horses
at Starbottle's Pass.

593
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,796
So five of us go down there,
hijack that stage,

594
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,953
re-route them tarts up here instead.
What's so hard about that?

595
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,110
It all sounds just fine to me.

596
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,590
- When do we go?!
- Order! Order!

597
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,955
Is it your proposal, Mr Rumson,

598
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:57,831
that we knock out the stage driver,
steal a coach and kidnap six women?

599
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,751
Sounds better every time I hear it.

600
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,628
- You don't see what's wrong with it?
- What?

601
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,110
If you don't consider
assault and battery,

602
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,069
grand larceny and kidnapping wrong,
what the hell do you consider wrong?

603
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,310
- You maniac!
- Sit down!

604
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,871
- You insane man!
- Schermerhorn, you're out of order.

605
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,554
- What?
- I yield the floor.

606
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,279
- Proceed, Schermerhorn.
- What?

607
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,990
- Speak!
- You maniac! You insane man!

608
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,958
What do you think them people
in Sonora will do

609
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,759
<b>when we hijack their Fräuleins?</b>

610
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,789
They grab their guns
and come up here to get them back!

611
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,438
Order, order!

612
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,671
- Gentlemen!
- Mr Atwell has the floor.

613
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,036
Gentlemen, it is 50 miles
from here to Starbottle's

614
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,079
without a road or a trail.
Not even my mule can do it, how...

615
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,915
You lunatics!
Besides a civil war with Sonora,

616
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,232
you want to put us
in the white slave business!

617
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,914
Schermerhorn, you're out of order!

618
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,753
- Again?
- You haven't been recognised!

619
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,032
I'm Schermerhorn.

620
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,588
- Mr Holbrook.
- Oh, sit down!

621
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,390
Ben, these boys are right.
Mr Holbrook, I withdraw the proposal.

622
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,635
Have you gone out of your skull?

623
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,996
You can't expect them
to build a two-storey building

624
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,992
- just to get women here.
- Who said two storeys?

625
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,753
Somebody has to run the faro tables.

626
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,796
Rotten Luck Willie will.

627
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,431
You can't expect him to build a fancy
building with chandeliers

628
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,469
and masterpieces of art and gambling,
and six beautiful tarts upstairs.

629
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,758
We'd have every bummer for miles
around coming here to spend his money

630
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,196
on women and whisky
at Atwell's and Schermerhorn's.

631
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,236
You think that's bad?

632
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,675
Why, it's terrible! Just terrible!

633
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,038
You'd turn this camp into a boom
town! We don't want to do that.

634
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,476
- Soon there'd be another saloon.
- And a bawdy house!

635
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,109
- And another gambling hall!
- And another bawdy house!

636
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,919
- And hotels!
- Property would shoot straight up.

637
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,709
They'd make more money
selling old claims than gold.

638
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,190
These men didn't come
out here to forge a nation!

639
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,751
That's for men with a big dream,
with visions of America's greatness.

640
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:34,756
I'm warning you, if you want to turn
us into a dreary boom town metropolis

641
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,796
filled with nothing but millionaires,

642
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,274
all you gotta do is put up one
little, tiny two-storey cathouse!

643
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:48,192
I say let's put it to a vote,
and any man opposed is a traitor!

644
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,912
All those in favour of bringing
prostitution to this camp, say aye!

645
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,674
Passed!

646
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,795
There's a shifty side to you that
I'm just beginning to appreciate.

647
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,190
- Why can't I go along with you?
- Who'll take care of Elizabeth?

648
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,556
Lt'll take three days
to get them tarts back here.

649
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,633
You don't expect me to leave her
alone in the middle of this?

650
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,790
Who can I trust if it ain't you?

651
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,358
You didn't say being pardners
meant wife-guarding.

652
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,635
Well, it just come up.

653
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,308
- Howdy.
- Captain Barnsfeather, Fort Sumter.

654
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,951
- When does the Sonora stage come?
- About four o'clock tomorrow. Why?

655
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,237
Supplies for the troops. Unmount!

656
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,437
Come in, Pardner.

657
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,794
- You sure I'm not intruding?
- Come in.

658
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,631
Will Ben really
get back in three days?

659
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,598
- Why?
- I'd like to know.

660
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,396
Who you expecting for dinner?

661
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,394
You! Sit down.

662
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,597
Thanks.

663
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,074
I didn't know you was expecting me.

664
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,552
I talk to the trees

665
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,713
But they don't listen to me

666
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,830
I talk to the stars

667
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:45,277
But they never hear me

668
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,351
The breeze hasn't time

669
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,115
To stop and hear what I say

670
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,037
I talk to them all

671
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,397
In vain

672
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,994
But suddenly my words

673
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:12,234
Reach someone else's ear

674
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:19,032
Touch someone else's
heartstrings too

675
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,998
I tell you my dreams

676
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,235
And while you're listening to me

677
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:37,511
I suddenly see them
Come true

678
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:43,477
I can see us on an April night

679
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,599
Looking out across a rollin' farm

680
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,878
Having supper in the candlelight

681
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,829
Walkin' later arm in arm

682
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,152
Then I'll tell you
how I passed the day

683
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:05,233
Thinking mainly
how the night would be

684
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:09,552
Then I'll try to find
the words to say

685
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,270
All the things you mean to me

686
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,910
I tell you my dreams

687
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,314
And while you're listening to me

688
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,393
I suddenly see them

689
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:36,312
Come true

690
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,069
They're coming out of Starbottle's!

691
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,828
All right! Fall together!

692
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,639
Put me down, you bloody idiot!
Put me down!

693
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:51,919
- Down, down, down, down!
- Get in line!

694
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,271
Come on, move!

695
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,394
Captain Barnsfeather, Fort Sumter.
At your service, ladies.

696
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:19,032
Here to protect you along the way!
We're gonna have to take this detour.

697
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:24,274
- A detour through open country?
- The road up ahead ain't safe.

698
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,636
- Injuns!
- Ain't no Injuns around here!

699
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,076
Get back in the coach, ladies.

700
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,873
- There's a coach comin' in!
- Comin' in!

701
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,190
There's a coach comin' in
If you listen, you can hear it

702
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,590
A-clip-cloppin' over the hill

703
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,956
And the sound that you hear
Is as good to your ear

704
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,350
As the call of
the wild whippoorwill

705
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,910
There's a coach comin' in
You can feel it gettin' near

706
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,231
All at once
And it bursts into view

707
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,995
And it looks to your eye
Like it fell from the sky

708
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,913
Like a coach
Full of dreams come true

709
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,595
For it's bringin' me
Eyes that are moonlight

710
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,195
And it's carryin' lips
That are wine

711
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,397
And it's comin'
With arms that are pillows

712
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,995
And this evening
It all will be mine

713
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,390
There's a coach comin' in
And you're smellin' like a steer

714
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,756
Get the soap out
It ain't far away

715
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,355
Cut the socks from your feet

716
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,750
Rake your hair till it's neat

717
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,914
There's a coach comin' in
There's a coach comin' in today

718
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,470
There's a coach comin' in
Hurry, hurry, do you hear?

719
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,677
With a cargo o' joy from Paree

720
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,196
Drop the tables and chairs
Get them beds up the stairs

721
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,989
And be sure
Every lock has a key

722
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,791
For it's coming with girls
Who buy perfume

723
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,475
Who wear powder
And rouge from Paree

724
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,711
Who will have to go
Somewhere to get them

725
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,076
And the somewhere to go will be me

726
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,630
There's a coach comin' in
And it's flyin' like a deer

727
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,951
Thank the Lord
There's relief on the way

728
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,749
Thank with all of your hearts

729
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,037
For them half-dozen tarts

730
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,477
There's a coach comin' in today

731
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,710
There's a coach comin' in
If you listen you can hear it

732
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,951
A-clip-cloppin' over the hill

733
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:15,715
And the sound that you hear
Is as good to your ear

734
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,429
As the call
Of a wild whippoorwill

735
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,150
For it's bringin' me eyes
That are moonlight

736
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,074
And it's carryin' lips
That are wine

737
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:43,436
And it's comin' with arms
That are pillows

738
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,717
And this evening
It all will be mine

739
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,109
There's a coach comin' in
You can feel it gettin' near

740
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,476
All at once
And it bursts into view

741
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,791
And it looks to your eye
Like it fell from the sky

742
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,429
Like a coach
Full of dreams come true

743
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,830
For it's bringin' me
Eyes that are moonlight

744
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,117
And it's carryin' lips
That are wine

745
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,556
And it's comin'
With arms that are pillows

746
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,076
And this evening
It all will be mine

747
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,755
There's a coach comin' in
Now it's riding in the clear

748
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:54,276
And the sound of it grows to a din

749
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:59,912
No, there ain't far to go
Now they're hollerin' "whoa!"

750
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,878
There's a coach comin' in
There's a coach comin'

751
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,235
And it's here

752
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,877
Ben!

753
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,392
Pardner, I wanna talk to you!

754
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,396
You rotten, lecherous,
deceiving, no-good, thieving...

755
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,155
The only reason I ain't blowing
your brains out is the relief

756
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:44,518
it's gonna give me when
I tear you apart with my bare hands.

757
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,238
What's the matter with you?

758
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,756
What was the two of you
doing on the same horse?

759
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,957
Riding. What else?
That's the last place I'd...

760
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,555
- Where was her horse?
- That was her horse.

761
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,155
And where was your horse?

762
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,111
You had my horse.

763
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,277
If that's true,
why ain't you fighting back?

764
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,430
Cos you ain't been yourself lately.

765
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,672
That's a widely known fact,
and you know it yourself.

766
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,156
Get up, Pardner.

767
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,589
- How's your jaw?
- Feels like it's coming off.

768
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:38,397
- You ought to trust me, Ben.
- You're right.

769
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,837
You ain't the kind of man that'd go
lusting after another man's wife,

770
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,230
especially with them six bawds
arriving in town.

771
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,756
That's right, Ben.
I wouldn't do that.

772
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:55,076
The only kind of feelings
you'd ever have would be deep ones,

773
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,116
and if you had 'em for Elizabeth,

774
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,556
you'd come and tell me
before you would her.

775
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,234
That's right, Ben.
That's what I'd do.

776
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,108
- You're a good man, Pardner.
- That's what I was coming to do.

777
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,272
Tell you I got
some deep feelings for Elizabeth.

778
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,872
You hit me one more time,
I'll bust your skull open.

779
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:25,353
Nothing's happened, and nothing's
gonna happen, cos I'm leaving.

780
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,911
You're breaking up the partnership?

781
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,273
If I hang around here long enough
watching you and her together,

782
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,318
I'll become
as big a lunatic as you are.

783
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,472
All right.

784
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,191
I'll go get your share
of the gold dust.

785
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,829
You can have the mule
and that new gold pan.

786
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,310
You can even have the rocker,
if you want to.

787
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,149
What's the matter, Ben?
Where you taking the rocker?

788
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,834
It's for Pardner. He's going away.

789
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:26,116
Going away?
He never mentioned going away to me.

790
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,353
Of course not. You don't know
that man like I do, Elizabeth.

791
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,792
What are you saying?

792
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,960
He loves you. That's why he's going.

793
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:44,275
I don't want Pardner to go.
I love him.

794
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:58,954
Unpack, Pardner. You ain't going
nowhere. That woman loves you.

795
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,029
And that puts a new wheel
on the wagon, don't it?

796
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,670
Get this straight. I'm not taking
away your wife, and that's final.

797
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,389
- But you love her.
- So do you.

798
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,469
There's only one way for anybody
to be happy and that's...

799
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,519
for one of us to move away
and forget it. And I'm going.

800
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,351
Get out of my way.

801
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,909
Pardner, there comes a time
in the life of every partnership

802
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,515
when the party of the first part
has no recourse

803
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,798
except to knock some sense
into the party of the second part!

804
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,677
You're staying!

805
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,034
- What happened?
- He's staying.

806
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,835
- Is he hurt?
- No. Just tired.

807
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,310
He'll be good as new
in a couple of weeks.

808
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,756
Where you going, Ben?

809
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:43,868
You love Pardner? You take him.
And you take good care of him.

810
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:48,590
That's the decentest man
I ever run across. And the strongest.

811
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:56,353
Now, I know you women like
things legal, so here's what.

812
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,115
It takes two weeks for you
to be an abandoned claim.

813
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,432
After that, you take the name
of your new owner

814
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:08,354
and file it down
at the mining office.

815
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,908
Then everything'll be legal.

816
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,917
I don't want you to go.
I love you.

817
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,916
What are you talking about?

818
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,432
You're my husband.
I don't want you to go away.

819
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,149
- What was that?
- Don't let him go, Pardner.

820
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,679
- You said she was in love with me.
- Didn't you say you loved him?

821
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,149
Yes, I did, and I do.

822
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,435
You just said
you were in love with Ben.

823
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,351
Yes, I did, and I am.

824
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,599
Ben, do you get that feeling
you need a drink?

825
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:58,389
- How did you know?
- Cos I do, too.

826
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,637
- But, Pardner, you don't drink.
- No, but I'm changing.

827
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,910
And it takes a woman to do it.

828
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,635
Bless their hearts.

829
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:23,068
Now, Elizabeth, let's try
and be reasonable about this.

830
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,674
For God's sake, make up your mind!

831
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,316
I can't. I love both of you.

832
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,359
But that ain't going to work.
You can't have both of us.

833
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,954
- Why not?
- Why not?

834
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:45,592
- Why not?
- A woman can't have two husbands.

835
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:50,357
I was married
to a man who had two wives.

836
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,000
Why can't a woman have two husbands?

837
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:57,790
- Because you can't.
- Well, why?

838
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:03,039
- You explain it to her, Ben.
- I'd like to oblige, Pardner,

839
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,874
but I'll be damned
if I can think of a reason.

840
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,509
Out here we make up
our own rules as we go along.

841
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:15,628
A man with two wives wants to sell
one at auction, nobody thinks twice.

842
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:20,794
If a town needs females, hijacking
'em seems the natural thing to do.

843
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,678
And if two pardners
want to share a wife, why not?

844
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,275
This ain't Michigan.
It's gold country.

845
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,635
Why, hell, it's the golden country!

846
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,837
Untouched and uncontaminated
by human hands!

847
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,196
People can look civilisation
in the eye and spit!

848
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:40,592
You don't have to please anybody,
don't have to love thy neighbour.

849
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,478
It's wild, human and free,

850
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:47,394
and all over this nation,
they preach against it every Sunday.

851
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,153
But I don't think God's listening.
You know why?

852
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,869
Because he's here,
in glorious California!

853
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:59,671
- You trying to say you're willing?
- I am.

854
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:05,153
I think it's a humane,
practical, beautiful solution.

855
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,118
- It does make a lot of sense.
- It don't.

856
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,272
It don't in Michigan.
It does in California.

857
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,670
- What's everybody gonna say?
- Who are you talking about?

858
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:18,878
You mean everybody in town
playing them French horns?

859
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,111
They'd be damn glad
to have two less in line.

860
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,831
You're right.

861
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:37,038
Of course I'm right. It's not like
somebody was asking you

862
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,078
to do something immoral,
like stealing gold!

863
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,516
- It ain't as bad as all that.
- What the hell's bad about it?

864
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,352
Show me on that list of commandments

865
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,830
where it says a woman
can't have two husbands.

866
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,309
There ain't no commandment like that!

867
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,479
Hot damn! I think it's great!
It's history-making!

868
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,676
Can't hold it.

869
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,997
- Elizabeth?
- Yes, Ben?

870
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,469
We will be three for dinner.

871
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,872
Shameless harlots!

872
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,750
You think the Lord was some boy in
a raggedy old sheet 2,000 years ago?

873
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:18,594
You're wrong.
He's here now and he sees you!

874
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:31,270
Ye godless jaspers! Who are you?
Freemasons? Rosicrucians?

875
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,836
Heathen emissaries
from the dens of Babylon?

876
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,115
Boozers. Gluttons.

877
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,512
Gamblers. Harlots. Fornicators!

878
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:48,634
- What's a fornicator?
- I don't know. I ain't religious.

879
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,509
The stench of the city is in the
Lord's nostrils, making Him sick.

880
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,433
The Lord ain't gonna take it
much longer!

881
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,593
Come on up, Parson,
and get some old-time religion.

882
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:18,477
- Mrs Rumson. How are your husbands?
- Fine. Thank you, Mr Atwell.

883
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,916
Husbands? Did I hear husbands?

884
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,834
You animals! You pagans!

885
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:32,878
O God, Lord of hosts,
close thine eyes, then hold thy nose.

886
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,236
I am passing through
the garbage of humanity!

887
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,276
Come on, dearie.

888
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:42,751
Scum, keep your filthy claws
off my wife, Princess Hummingbird!

889
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,470
You heathen swine!

890
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,518
Do you know what God done
to Sodom and Gomorrah

891
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,479
when he couldn't find 50 righteous
men in them stinking cities?

892
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,839
I'll show God a place
where there ain't 40.

893
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,876
- Yeah!
- 30!

894
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,076
- Yeah!
- Two!

895
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,833
- Yeah!
- Or one!

896
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:08,913
- Yeah!
- And here it is.

897
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:13,512
You want to see sin
of the wickedest kind? Here it is

898
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:18,071
You want to see virtue left behind?
Here it is

899
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,390
Sodom was vice and vice a versa

900
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,189
You want to see where
the vice is worser? Here it is

901
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,510
I mean, here it is

902
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:31,469
You want to live life
in the rottenest way? Here it is

903
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:35,872
Women and whisky night and day
Here it is

904
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:40,431
You want to embrace the golden calf
Ankle and thigh and upper half?

905
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:44,593
Here it is
I mean, here it is

906
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:49,435
No Name City, No Name City
The Lord don't like it here

907
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,877
No Name City, No Name City
Your reckonin' day is near

908
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:57,919
No Name City, No Name City
Here's what he's gonna do

909
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,471
Gobble up this town
Swallow it down and goodbye to you

910
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,872
Will you go to heaven?
Will you go to hell?

911
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:11,556
Either repent or fare thee well

912
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,154
God'll take care o' No Name City

913
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,435
Comes the end
and it won't be pretty

914
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:20,877
Here it is
I mean, here it is

915
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,757
Amen

916
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:02,113
- Evening, Pardner.
- Evening, Elizabeth.

917
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,715
- Evening, Ben.
- Evening, Elizabeth.

918
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,073
I hear George Lonergan
pulled out today.

919
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:37,277
- He's smart.
- He's broke.

920
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,478
Ben thinks placer mining's
all but finished in these parts.

921
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,838
What are we gonna do?

922
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,354
I hear talk of a strike
up to Red Dog.

923
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:53,878
- I'm not leaving my home, Ben.
- I wasn't suggesting it.

924
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:59,034
I'll live on grass and mud water
before I'd do that.

925
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,157
Ben isn't asking you
to leave your home.

926
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:07,394
Damn it! Why not? You like this town
as much as I like Schermerhorn!

927
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,552
That's right,
I hate what this town has become,

928
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,108
but it's one place
we can live together.

929
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,393
And there's nothing I hate as much

930
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:21,359
as I love the two of you
and this cabin.

931
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:27,274
If you want to go to Red Dog,
you go ahead, but I'm staying here.

932
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,351
You come back whenever you want to.

933
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:34,508
The only thing stopping you
being perfect is your stubbornness.

934
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,798
Somebody should hit you till it's
gone. Somebody's gotta support us.

935
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,474
You can't go through
a whole winter here alone.

936
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,710
I won't leave her here alone.

937
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,715
You'd let this man who took care
of you and nursed you back to health

938
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,396
light out alone while you sleep
through winter like a fat groundhog?

939
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:58,996
- If he goes, you go.
- And I ain't going.

940
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,669
- Well, I'll go, then.
- If he goes, you go with him.

941
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,799
Didn't I just tell you you can't go
through a winter alone here?

942
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,515
You ever see such a stubborn woman?

943
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,114
No, I never did.

944
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,799
But if you ever hit her, you'll
have to deal with me straightaway.

945
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:50,272
- I sure am one tired man tonight.
- Must be from lifting those cards.

946
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,074
I only played a few hands last night.
I had a lucky streak. I broke even.

947
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:04,436
You'll tell Three-Fingered Sweeney
I'll pay him next week.

948
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:10,478
- You was playing poker last night?
- I was, and you was tired. Remember?

949
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:19,198
Well, I think I'll go have a
last drink with them three limeys.

950
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,636
- They're pulling out tomorrow.
- How much does he owe Sweeney?

951
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:26,713
- Wait. I won't take your money.
- Why not?

952
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,634
Cos a man don't do that
in Michigan or in California.

953
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,996
That's OK with me, but if you
want to keep your manhood,

954
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,390
quit trying to beat
three aces with a pair of fours.

955
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,755
See you at breakfast.

956
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:15,517
Sorry, boys,
Pardner ain't playing tonight.

957
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,910
- Willie? Have you seen Mad Jack?
- He's over there.

958
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:39,519
I want to convert
this dust into dollars.

959
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,718
Look out! He's losing gold dust
every time you bump his elbow.

960
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,715
There's more spilled here in one
night than we've dug up in a month.

961
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,837
Must be a pirate's fortune
under them floorboards.

962
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:55,196
- Where are you heading?
- Where I can find some gold.

963
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,716
Fleshpot Hill,
Brass Monkey Ravine. I don't know.

964
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,270
Save your souls
and help build a house for the Lord.

965
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:05,352
He can have my shack. I'm moving out.

966
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,672
You heathen scum. Money.

967
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:13,832
And the Lord sayeth,
"Money is the root of all evil".

968
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,150
Cos he ain't never been rich.

969
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,515
- He knoweth about you...
- You don't say?

970
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,160
Living like animals.
You're going to hell!

971
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,470
I hope so. It ain't too far down,

972
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:28,076
I'll tunnel and get some gold dust
that's fallen through these floor...

973
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:39,635
How do you figure we can
dig a tunnel without being seen?

974
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,950
We'll dig down from
the floor in our cabin,

975
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:46,272
under the street,
and right up under here.

976
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,476
- A tunnel?
- You idiot!

977
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:21,073
- Why, you lunatic.
- Dig now. Hit him later.

978
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:24,755
- What the hell's happening?
- We're tunnelling under Willie's.

979
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,718
After that gold dust under his floor.

980
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:33,309
- How did you know?
- Been thinking about it for weeks.

981
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:38,315
Why didn't you speak up?
You dirty, lazy, drunken...

982
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,790
- Lazy, am I? Damn you, Duncan!
- Shut up!

983
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:45,350
- Look, dig now. Hit him later.
- Right.

984
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,034
- You can hit me later.
- I'll remind you.

985
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:51,874
- Don't forget. Pardner's in on this.
- Then where is he?

986
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,394
- He's at home.
- Doing what?

987
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,313
Damn you!
Keep a civil tongue or I'll...

988
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:00,915
- You can hit him later.
- Right. You can hit me later.

989
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,797
And I'll remind you. Dig!

990
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,036
Hey, Willie, you seen Ben Rumson?

991
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,274
- Sorry.
- Close the bloody door.

992
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:46,918
- You're digging a hole.
- You don't miss a trick, do you?

993
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,235
Pardner, we got big news for you.

994
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:00,712
- You're what?
- We ain't stopping at Willie's.

995
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,999
There's 16 gambling halls,
seven hotels and 21 saloons.

996
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,640
Mad Jack figures
we can build tunnels under them,

997
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:11,439
honeycomb Main Street,
one end to the other.

998
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,398
- What do we do with all that earth?
- Give it to the meek.

999
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,313
- Have you gone crazy?
- He's not crazy.

1000
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:20,153
There's a lot of gold dust
going through those floors.

1001
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,276
I think there's more than a lot.

1002
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:25,352
I think maybe
there's enough for the winter.

1003
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:34,553
Hurry up and eat this, both of you.
Coffee will be ready in a minute.

1004
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,835
I don't want you to be late to work.

1005
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:54,517
- The earth is pure muck
- Muck's a good thing

1006
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:58,593
- And oozin' with mud
- Mud is just fine

1007
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:02,514
- It's drownin' in bog
- Bog is good luck

1008
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:06,309
And crawlin' with crud
Crud's a good sign

1009
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,872
The poor, they got hope
The rich can buy soap

1010
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:18,908
What rainbows ain't got a pot of

1011
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,788
And I ain't got a spot of

1012
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,509
A few feet down there's a lot of

1013
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:32,232
Just waitin' to buy
Tobacco and rye from now till I die

1014
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:42,150
The best things in life are dirty
And nothing in life is

1015
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:46,279
- Better to hold than dirty gold
- The best things in life are

1016
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:51,229
Filthy, dirty hunks
Of gold, gold, gold

1017
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:01,074
- There's more than just gold
- Gold is enough

1018
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:05,039
- That's buried below
- Beautiful gold

1019
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,669
- There's seed in the ground
- Loveable gold

1020
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:12,799
- Just waitin' to grow
- Spendable gold

1021
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:18,193
A man has his creed
And mine is all greed

1022
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:24,159
What banks have bulgin' accounts of

1023
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:28,153
And I ain't got an ounce of

1024
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:33,598
- Below there's endless amounts of
- Just dirty old trash

1025
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:37,559
That turns in a flash
To dirty old cash

1026
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:55,434
- The best things in life are dirty
- The worst thing in life is

1027
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:00,230
- Wakin' up clean without a bean
- The best things in life are

1028
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:04,757
Filthy dirty hunks
Of gold, gold, gold

1029
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:24,877
The best things in life are dirty
The worst thing in life is

1030
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:29,033
Being content without a cent
The best things in life are

1031
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:34,752
Filthy dirty hunks
Of gold, gold, gold, gold

1032
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:40,392
Stinkin' rotten chunks
Of blimey, slimy, lousy, lovely

1033
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,869
Gold.

1034
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,710
You bummers, over here!

1035
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,349
I found him in the mountains.
He's half-frozen.

1036
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:31,750
He says there's a wagon train
marooned up there.

1037
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,592
Get up a rescue party!

1038
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:40,190
Let's get out of these mountains
before a storm comes up. Pack up!

1039
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:42,999
You've arrived at the height
of the season, Mr Fenty,

1040
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:46,709
but we'll find hotel space
for the whole bloody lot of you.

1041
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:51,271
If you don't die,
you'll have one hell of a time.

1042
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:55,357
We shouldn't take
respectable people to No Name City.

1043
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:59,513
We can put up a few up at our place.
Can you take the rest?

1044
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,434
Have you got room in your
cabin for a couple of invalids?

1045
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,839
Ben's bringing in her husband.
Mrs Fenty, this is Mrs Rumson.

1046
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:12,629
I'm Mrs Fenty's son, Horton.
This is my sister Laura Sue.

1047
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,678
Here are some blankets.
Keep warm by the fire.

1048
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,755
I'll take care of the children.

1049
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,869
Your husband is a good man,
Mrs Rumson.

1050
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,757
Yes, they are.

1051
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,718
I said that husband
of yours is a good man.

1052
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:38,349
Yes, thank you, Mrs Fenty.
Don't you worry.

1053
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:41,512
The children went to sleep.
I'll see to Mr Fenty now.

1054
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,352
Thank you, Mr Rumson.

1055
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:47,513
My name's not Rumson, ma'am.
That's my wife's name.

1056
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:55,359
I'll bet that seems
a little confusing, don't it?

1057
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,271
A little, yes.

1058
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,071
How is it you and your husband
don't have the same name?

1059
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:07,391
- That's easy to explain.
- It is?

1060
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:14,711
In the Chinese section of town
was the Pagoda Hell Saloon,

1061
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:19,510
and upstairs there lived
a real Mandarin princess

1062
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,910
who invited me over
occasionally for a little egg roll.

1063
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:29,637
I'm entering to pray
for the unfortunate victims.

1064
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,075
Parson, these folks
have suffered enough.

1065
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:35,038
Why don't you do that outside
where God can hear better,

1066
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:37,634
cos I'll be talking in here.

1067
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:41,713
You can't talk to the parson
that way in front of these people.

1068
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:44,314
This is a nice, church-going family.

1069
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,472
Go see where Pardner is
with the supplies.

1070
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,118
Yes, ma'am.

1071
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:53,591
Mr Rumson, will you tell me
the rest of the story after dinner?

1072
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,716
Sure. About 10 years after dinner.

1073
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:07,114
I'll take care of
your little sister. You keep warm.

1074
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:16,396
Mrs Rumson, if the other gentleman
is your husband, who's Mr Rumson?

1075
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:22,552
- He's my husband's partner.
- How is it you have his name?

1076
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:26,120
Just a coincidence.

1077
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,956
What are you talking about?
Elizabeth ain't sick.

1078
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:34,874
You listen to me. She's got
a bad case of the respectabilities.

1079
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,919
In a few days she'll
be burning up in a fever of virtue.

1080
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,356
- And then look out.
- Why?

1081
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:46,274
It's been my experience
that there's nothing more ruthless

1082
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:49,796
and treacherous
than a genuine good woman.

1083
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,712
Ben, you have to stay
at Atwell's tonight.

1084
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,869
What?

1085
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:05,350
I can't tell them I'm living with
two men. I just can't.

1086
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,273
Elizabeth, you ain't making sense.

1087
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:12,319
If you want to be respectable,
how come Mr Rumson has to move out

1088
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:15,073
while Mrs Rumson
stays with another man?

1089
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,628
If anybody leaves, it ought to be me.

1090
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:21,190
You can't. I already
told them Pardner's my husband.

1091
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,193
- Tell them you've made a mistake.
- It's only for one or two nights.

1092
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:29,637
It'll be six weeks
before they can move!

1093
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:31,756
Only a farmer's
dumb enough to get froze

1094
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,957
and tough enough to survive it.
Damn farmers!

1095
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,831
- OK, I'll sleep out.
- Where you going?

1096
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:41,992
- To get my things.
- I got 'em right here.

1097
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,875
See you in the tunnels, Ben.

1098
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:45,993
- You moving out, Ben?
- No.

1099
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:51,154
Me, neither. I guess there's two
kinds in the world.

1100
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:55,472
People who move, people who stay.
Ain't that true?

1101
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:59,348
- No, that ain't true.
- Well, what's true?

1102
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,749
Oh, there's two kinds of people...

1103
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:07,358
Them going somewhere and them going
nowhere, and that's what's true.

1104
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:10,590
I don't agree, Ben.

1105
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:14,070
That's cos you don't know
what the hell I'm talking about.

1106
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:18,836
I'm an ex-citizen of nowhere,
and sometimes I get mighty homesick.

1107
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:28,030
I was born

1108
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:32,511
Under a wanderin' star

1109
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:38,119
I was born

1110
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:42,557
Under a wanderin' star

1111
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:47,792
Wheels are made for rollin'
Mules are made to pack

1112
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:52,635
I've never seen a sight
That didn't look better lookin' back

1113
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:56,599
I was born

1114
01:51:56,680 --> 01:52:01,231
Under a wanderin' star

1115
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:06,718
Mud can make you a prisoner
And the plains can bake you dry

1116
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:11,555
Snow can burn your eyes
But only people make you cry

1117
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:16,350
Home is made for comin' from
For dreams of goin' to

1118
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:19,910
Which, with any luck
Will never come true

1119
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:25,039
I was born

1120
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:29,511
Under a wanderin' star

1121
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:34,639
I was born

1122
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:39,748
Under a wanderin' star

1123
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:44,516
Do I know where hell is?
Hell is in hello

1124
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:49,276
Heaven is goodbye forever
It's time for me to go

1125
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:53,558
I was born

1126
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:58,156
Under a wanderin' star

1127
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:04,713
A wanderin', wanderin' star

1128
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:12,997
Mud can make you prisoner
And the plains can bake you dry

1129
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:17,835
Snow can burn your eyes
But only people make you cry

1130
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:22,630
Home is made for comin' from
For dreams of goin' to

1131
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:27,316
Which, with any luck
Will never come true

1132
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:31,439
I was born

1133
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:36,548
Under a wanderin' star

1134
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:40,872
I was born

1135
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:45,829
Under a wanderin' star

1136
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:50,789
When I get to heaven
Tie me to a tree

1137
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:55,476
Or I'll begin to roam
And soon you know where I will be

1138
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:59,599
I was born

1139
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:03,992
Under a wanderin' star

1140
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:10,394
A wanderin', wanderin' star

1141
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,876
Willie, could you accommodate me
for a couple of days?

1142
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:03,875
- Sure. Take your pick.
- No. I mean a room I can sleep in.

1143
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:05,757
We don't rent empty beds.

1144
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,752
Just till them
sick farmers leave my house.

1145
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:11,354
Wait. Clotilde's
gone off for a while.

1146
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,591
- Use her room.
- What happened to Clotilde?

1147
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:17,831
Some bummer says if she don't
marry him, he's gonna kill her.

1148
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:20,480
She took off to let him simmer down.

1149
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,956
She said she'd marry him.
He wants her to quit working.

1150
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,315
That's a narrow-minded attitude.

1151
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,316
She's a fancy smeller.

1152
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:51,277
Damn farmers.

1153
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:02,357
Sugar, guess who this is?

1154
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:05,591
Sugar, guess who this is!

1155
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:20,276
By goom, I must have been
down here too long.

1156
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:23,318
You're beginning
to smell like a woman.

1157
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:26,793
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Rumson.

1158
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,350
You're an hour late.
Who the hell's the stranger?

1159
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:33,398
He won't tell anybody.
He's practically family.

1160
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:36,438
Just wanted to see
what a gold mine looked like.

1161
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:41,071
You open your mouth about this,
I'll put a stick of dynamite in it.

1162
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:44,709
- You tell no one, do you hear?
- I swear before God.

1163
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:48,679
I said no one.
Start at end of number four.

1164
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:52,150
Work an extra hour
to make up for being late.

1165
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:01,757
- How's Elizabeth?
- She's fine.

1166
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:04,832
We'd like to have you
for dinner tonight.

1167
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:08,117
- Is that right?
- Yeah. 6:30. Is that all right?

1168
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:13,479
It's mighty neighbourly, but I got
to play the organ for the parson.

1169
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:16,949
Possibly some other time.

1170
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:29,040
If you're one of the family, dig!

1171
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:35,876
Mr Rumson, I swore
I wouldn't tell anyone.

1172
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:38,110
I hope that means except my parents.

1173
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:41,192
That means especially
your mother and father.

1174
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,236
I've never kept secrets before.

1175
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:46,596
It's about time you started,
cos when you do,

1176
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:49,478
a whole new world opens up.

1177
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:56,109
You got that kind of cold,
empty feeling inside of you?

1178
01:57:56,200 --> 01:58:00,239
- Yes. Do all gold miners get that?
- It's very common.

1179
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,276
What do they do for it?

1180
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,555
I'll show you.

1181
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,910
Are we going in a saloon?

1182
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,912
That's where
the medicine closet is.

1183
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,390
It's part of that whole new world
I was telling you about.

1184
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,312
After you, Columbus.

1185
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:29,956
Gentle music fills the sky
At No Name City

1186
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:35,273
And the days, they whisper by
At No Name City

1187
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:42,870
Sure, there's not a spot as rare in
All heaven or in Erin

1188
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:50,712
Let me live until I die
In No Name Town

1189
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:21,555
That's good. My first drink.

1190
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:42,112
- You feeling all right?
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

1191
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:48,674
That cold, hollow feeling
is almost gone.

1192
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,876
Bartender, cigars.

1193
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,677
Thank you.

1194
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,998
I'll bet that's the strongest cigar
you ever smoked.

1195
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:25,595
It's the first cigar I ever smoked.
It's delicious.

1196
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:32,636
- You all right, Mr Rumson?
- Fine.

1197
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:52,436
Why do you think my father
is so dead set against saloons?

1198
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:56,593
Cos farmers ain't got the time
to enjoy the good things in life.

1199
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:58,716
Farmer's got a busy day...

1200
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:02,031
Got to pull them turnips,
talk about the weather.

1201
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:04,953
That's about as much
as he can handle.

1202
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:11,356
Quiet!

1203
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:14,591
- Who are they, Mr Rumson?
- They're on the menu.

1204
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,036
I don't understand, sir.

1205
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:29,999
You ain't gonna tell me that you
ain't never had a woman, neither?

1206
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:32,476
No, sir, I haven't.

1207
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:36,432
That's terrible!

1208
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:41,229
Do you know you could go blind?
We got to do something about that.

1209
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:43,072
I wouldn't know what to do.

1210
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:46,869
Don't worry. With your talent,
you'll catch on in no time.

1211
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:55,157
Willie, if you was to go trapping
for the first time,

1212
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:58,437
who would you take along as a guide?

1213
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:04,468
That would be Gracie.
She loves adventure.

1214
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,834
Grace, I give you the boy.

1215
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:35,109
Give me back the man.

1216
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:47,558
- That was the best.
- You think so?

1217
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:51,519
I like smoking and drinking,
but they can't touch the last one.

1218
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:53,352
That's got everything.

1219
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:56,750
Most people'd go along
with that. Well, good night.

1220
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:00,355
Mrs Rumson will be sorry
you're not coming for dinner.

1221
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:04,228
The last thing she said this morning
was to be sure and bring you.

1222
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:09,553
- In that case, maybe I will.
- Good. I'll walk you home after.

1223
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:16,715
Remember, you wasn't in no
tunnels and wasn't in no saloon.

1224
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,870
I remember.

1225
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:22,350
We thank thee, Lord,
for the two of these friends...

1226
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:25,712
Shut the door.

1227
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:32,270
For this
we thank thee, Lord. Amen.

1228
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:38,076
- Will you wipe your feet off?
- Evening, Ben. Sit down.

1229
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:39,912
Evening, Elizabeth.

1230
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:50,834
Well, Pardner,
you handled grace pretty good.

1231
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:54,913
Not as good as Horton did this
afternoon, but pretty good.

1232
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:59,549
- Where have you been?
- Gold mining.

1233
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:03,599
Your son's the most natural-born
gold miner that I ever met.

1234
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,672
I brought him up not
to be afraid to try anything.

1235
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:09,399
That boy tries everything.

1236
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:14,508
Did you know that the Fentys had
an apple farm back in Pennsylvania?

1237
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:16,192
Applejack?

1238
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:20,671
- No, we did not make applejack.
- Then why grow apples?

1239
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:26,039
Mr Rumson, should everything
from the earth be used for liquor?

1240
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:29,874
- Whenever possible.
- You should read the Bible.

1241
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:31,996
I have read the Bible.

1242
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:34,310
Didn't that discourage you
from drinking?

1243
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,595
No. Killed my appetite for reading.

1244
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:41,630
We've been telling the Fentys
what good land's all around here.

1245
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:45,713
- We're thinking of settling here.
- Great!

1246
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:50,112
That news is so God damn great,
I need a drink.

1247
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:52,873
Don't listen to him.
He's always joking.

1248
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:57,953
- Elizabeth, the whisky's gone.
- I know. I poured it all out.

1249
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:02,272
- You what?
- Out of courtesy to our guests.

1250
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:05,875
If you want a drink,
get your carcass out of this house.

1251
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:10,437
You can't order a man
out of his own house.

1252
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:13,239
- His house?
- That's right. It's his house.

1253
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:17,518
- Mrs Rumson is married to him?
- She's married to the both of us.

1254
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:20,831
- At the same time?
- Well, we're pardners.

1255
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:24,151
- I have never heard...
- Shut up and sit down!

1256
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:28,119
- Don't order the guests around.
- Why not? It's his fault.

1257
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:33,433
Without his respectability, we'd
still be a happily married... triple.

1258
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:36,876
- There's not one drink of whisky?
- Take mine.

1259
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,791
Thank you. You saved my life.

1260
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:42,111
Horton, how did that bottle
get into your pocket?

1261
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:47,433
- How long have you been drinking?
- Since this afternoon.

1262
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:51,308
You don't approve, but until
you've had a good cigar and whisky,

1263
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:54,153
you're missing
two of the best things in life.

1264
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:59,837
- Where'd you take him, Ben?
- Damn you, Ben Rumson.

1265
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:01,876
What are you gonna
teach this boy next?

1266
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:07,080
How to cheat at cards or
physical education with some floozy?

1267
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:09,276
That's the best one.

1268
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:15,718
- Is that what you did today, Ben?
- That's what he did today.

1269
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:20,351
He's got a talent for dissipation
that is absolutely unique.

1270
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:27,478
Out. Get out!
I order you out of this house!

1271
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:31,438
This is not your house!
This is my house!

1272
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,351
That's right. I give her the house.

1273
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:39,876
If you cross this threshold again,

1274
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:42,428
I'll shoot you
like any other marauder.

1275
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:47,513
- What's she so het up about?
- She's got a right to be.

1276
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:51,388
You had to take your revenge
on the virtue of this boy,

1277
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:54,278
show him what an ugly town
this really is.

1278
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:57,636
If we live here,
then we're ugly, too.

1279
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:00,792
I could never go back
to what we had before.

1280
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:04,714
It's over and it's done
and it's finished. Now get out.

1281
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:10,511
- Wait. If Ben goes, I'd have to go.
- Then you go, too.

1282
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:35,830
- Evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, ma'am.

1283
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:43,792
You mutton-headed clunk. You knew
she didn't want them to know.

1284
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:46,599
Elizabeth's a sick woman.

1285
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:49,478
You got no respect
for anybody or anything.

1286
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:54,429
I don't have your kind of respect,
sitting there with your hands folded

1287
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:58,229
and that pious look on your face
after a hard day's thieving.

1288
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:01,392
- It ain't thieving.
- Then why are we hiding it?

1289
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:04,438
Why are we talking about it?
She's all alone.

1290
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:06,875
- Whose fault is that?
- Yours.

1291
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,712
Hers. She threw us out.

1292
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:11,837
Don't say anything
against Elizabeth around me.

1293
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:16,198
I'll say anything I want. She's my
wife, paid for, and don't forget it.

1294
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,954
I never do forget it.

1295
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:27,555
- I got nothing more to say to you.
- You got nothing I want to hear!

1296
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,995
If I catch you
sneaking back without me,

1297
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:31,832
they'll never find
all of you to bury!

1298
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:36,034
Bull and bear fight!
Bull and bear fight!

1299
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:39,510
See the great bull that cut up
the mountain lion in Sonora

1300
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:43,070
and emerged triumphant
over 10 large dogs!

1301
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:45,628
Save your souls, heathen scum!

1302
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:48,917
Allow this butchery
to take place on Sunday,

1303
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,911
and God will wash his hands of you!

1304
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,797
Thank you, parson. Now go.

1305
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:55,189
God is gonna cause the earth to open

1306
02:08:55,280 --> 02:09:00,149
and swallow up this nest of evil,
and the Lord ain't fooling.

1307
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:05,673
I hear strange rumblings
in the earth below.

1308
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:11,908
They' sell a lot of tickets
to the bull and bear fight on Sunday.

1309
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:15,034
A lot of gold dust is gonna fall.

1310
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:18,590
But Jack, we don't have
a tunnel under there!

1311
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:26,758
You bloody maniac!
Why didn't you build one?!

1312
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:31,039
We can get under there by Sunday.
There's nothing to it.

1313
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,996
Maybe so.

1314
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:40,313
But we could sure use a bit of help.

1315
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:54,196
What about that young farmer?
Where's he?

1316
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:58,751
Horton Fenty? Little did
I realise it, but when he set foot

1317
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:03,709
on the second storey of Willie's
Saloon, history was in the making.

1318
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:06,234
- Is that where he is?
- That's where he always is!

1319
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:09,630
Puffing cigars, drinking,
and knocking on doors.

1320
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:13,793
If he don't slow down, them girls
are gonna strike for shorter hours.

1321
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:18,756
I'll see if I can catch him
between rooms tonight.

1322
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:23,874
If we could divert his energy,
we could be through by morning.

1323
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,758
Come on, bet.

1324
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:32,478
I'll bet 50.

1325
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:37,639
- I'll see that and raise you 50.
- Not for me. I'm out.

1326
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:43,318
Have you seen
the future father of our country?

1327
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:46,358
- Yeah. He went home.
- When will he be back?

1328
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:50,433
- Soon as his folks are asleep.
- Tell him I want to see him.

1329
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:53,353
Leave your door open
and wait your turn.

1330
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:56,997
Here.

1331
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:09,710
Pardon me, sir.
Could you lend me $10?

1332
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,515
Why don't you go home and go to bed?

1333
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:15,672
I was thinking of doing it
the other way around.

1334
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:22,950
- Thank you, sir.
- I'll see your 50.

1335
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:27,629
Red seven wins again!

1336
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:48,233
Pardon me. Here's your $10 back, sir.

1337
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:51,797
And 10 more. Red seven.

1338
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:11,877
You're losing a lot of money,
Pardner. Where do you get it all?

1339
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:14,076
Thieving.

1340
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:25,955
I would give the world to see
How I used to be

1341
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:29,715
When I had no axe to grind
Except for choppin' wood

1342
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:36,235
Day was day, and night was night
Wrong was never right

1343
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:39,995
It didn't matter where I went
As much as where I stood

1344
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:46,759
I had dreams
Average size

1345
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:51,834
There were stars
In the skies

1346
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:54,718
Not my eyes

1347
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:01,828
Then I got gold fever

1348
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:06,318
No rompin', rollin'
Girl-and-fellow stuff

1349
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:09,790
Can cure the gold fever

1350
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:13,872
Nothin' can help you
But the yellow stuff

1351
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:19,636
What can stop that itchin'

1352
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:23,669
Ain't around the kitchen

1353
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:29,710
Gold, gold, hooked am I
Susannah, go ahead and cry

1354
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:44,311
Once we all did honest work
Farmer, lawyer, clerk

1355
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:48,359
Married men and single men
And some who ain't too sure

1356
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:54,636
Now I look at them and see
Duplicates of me

1357
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:58,793
Cured of what we suffered from
And sufferin' from the cure

1358
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:05,638
Who can say why we came?

1359
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:09,838
Where's the hope?
Where's the flame?

1360
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:14,595
We're the same

1361
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:21,712
When you've got gold fever

1362
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:25,712
No rompin', rollin'
Girl-and-fellow stuff

1363
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:29,270
Can cure the gold fever

1364
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:33,556
Nothin' can help you
But the yellow stuff

1365
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:39,435
What can stop that itchin'

1366
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:43,149
Ain't around the kitchen

1367
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:49,076
Gold, gold, hooked am I
Susannah, go ahead and cry

1368
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:53,797
Gold fever

1369
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:56,997
Gold fever

1370
02:14:58,240 --> 02:15:00,595
Gold fever

1371
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:04,588
Gold fever

1372
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:08,638
Gold fever

1373
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:11,636
Deal.

1374
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,036
By God, we made it.

1375
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:49,990
Now they can open the box office.

1376
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:17,595
Here's your day's earnings, Ben.

1377
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:21,475
And here's yours, Pardner.

1378
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:29,472
- Tell Ben something for me.
- He's right there.

1379
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:34,036
Just tell him that I'm moving on
before winter sets in.

1380
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:35,917
He can get himself another Pardner.

1381
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,754
You bummers can divide up
anything I got coming here.

1382
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:42,478
Where you heading?

1383
02:16:42,560 --> 02:16:46,997
Red Dog. I hear they're
digging it up in chunks there.

1384
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:51,272
By goom, they're always digging
it up in chunks somewhere else.

1385
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:56,517
- Good luck, man.
- Thanks, Jack.

1386
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:07,357
Tell Ben to look in on Elizabeth.
The Fentys are pulling out.

1387
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:11,035
She'll be alone.

1388
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:27,550
You stinkin', rotten heathen scum!

1389
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:30,996
Silence, Judas! Today is Sunday!

1390
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:35,198
And you are going to hear the word
of God whether you like it or not!

1391
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:40,434
- Get out of here!
- And the word of the Lord is doom!

1392
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:42,272
Set the bull on him.

1393
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:44,715
- You can't do that.
- Let him out!

1394
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:49,750
...this town of lust and corruption!

1395
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:53,637
Get out of here.

1396
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,509
Out, out, out.

1397
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:03,675
You are not going to fight
that bear on the Sabbath.

1398
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:12,119
I represent the Lord, and the Lord
says get out of this arena.

1399
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:18,550
The Lord will open the earth, and you
will sink into the pit! You hear?!

1400
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:25,156
I said, sink into the pit.
I said, sink into the pit!

1401
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:33,793
- I'll be God damned.
- Hello, parson. Welcome to hell.

1402
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:25,472
Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1403
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:28,393
You better run through that valley!

1404
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:04,078
Will you kindly watch where the
hell you're falling, my good man?!

1405
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,637
Now where are you going?

1406
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:16,518
Ach du lieber Himmel! Nein!

1407
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:02,674
Have you seen Pardner and Ben?
Pardner and Ben?

1408
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,916
Have you seen Pardner and Ben?

1409
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:21,757
- Where's Ben?
- Ben Rumson!

1410
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:27,069
Thy rod and thy staff...

1411
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:30,675
- There he is!
- Go down and get him!

1412
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:33,553
Ben! Where you going?

1413
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:42,991
No Name City, No Name City
The Lord don't like it here

1414
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:47,551
No Name City, No Name City
Your reckonin' day is here

1415
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:51,599
No Name City, No Name City
Here's what he's gonna do

1416
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:53,830
Gobble up this town
And swallow it down

1417
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:56,070
And goodbye to you

1418
02:21:56,160 --> 02:22:00,278
Will you go to heaven?
Will you go to hell?

1419
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:04,872
Either repent or fare thee well

1420
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:09,870
God'll take care of No Name City
Comes the end, it won't be pretty

1421
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:14,556
Here it is
I mean, here it is

1422
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:18,519
Here it is
I mean, here it is

1423
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:21,160
Here it is

1424
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:25,950
I mean, here it is

1425
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:34,389
For in heaven or in Erin

1426
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:39,918
Let me live until I die
In No Name Town

1427
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:47,320
Let me live until I die...

1428
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:55,353
Let's get out of here.
I think this place is crumbling.

1429
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,872
Be calm, my dear.

1430
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:41,475
Pardner, where's Ben?

1431
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:50,271
What the hell are you doing there?

1432
02:24:56,080 --> 02:25:00,517
I didn't like that town, but it'll
seem funny not having it there.

1433
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:06,436
It's gonna be a cold,
long, hard winter without it.

1434
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,195
I'm not leaving my home, Pardner.

1435
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:15,232
I know that.

1436
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:22,719
Do you have to go? Can't we
all try living the way we used to?

1437
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:31,471
No. No, I can't.

1438
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,516
You see, ever since that night
the Fentys came and we were...

1439
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:41,637
You and I were like
a real husband and wife,

1440
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:49,393
I couldn't live with you
any other way.

1441
02:25:52,400 --> 02:25:55,233
And you belong to Ben.
He shared you with me.

1442
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:57,276
I didn't share you with him.

1443
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,599
Ma'am...

1444
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:38,188
Whoa, mule. Did you know
them farmers was unpacking?

1445
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:42,759
- You mean the Fenty party?
- It ain't my idea of a party.

1446
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:45,354
Hop in. You can't get out that way.

1447
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,992
Come on. Giddy up, mule.

1448
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:57,033
I didn't see them building a church
and court till the town went under.

1449
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:59,076
Neither did I.

1450
02:26:59,160 --> 02:27:02,118
- You still heading up to Red Dog?
- Yeah. Still am.

1451
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:07,035
I don't care where we go as long
as I stay ahead of civilisation.

1452
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:13,230
- You moving out, Ben?
- You want me to die?

1453
02:27:13,320 --> 02:27:17,916
I can see this valley in a year.
Broke out in white clapboard houses,

1454
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:21,276
schools, churches,
courthouse, museum.

1455
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:24,471
Just one big, bad dream.

1456
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:30,473
- What about Elizabeth?
- I'm gonna miss that woman.

1457
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:33,757
But you can't blast her
out of that cabin.

1458
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:36,957
Funny, here we go and build a town
just the way we like it,

1459
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:39,998
and then we go and sink it.
Giddup, mule!

1460
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:52,199
- Pull up, Ben.
- Whoa, mule. What's the matter?

1461
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:57,672
I'm staying. I have to.

1462
02:27:58,480 --> 02:28:01,916
I always said
you had a farmer's mentality,

1463
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:05,310
but you're still the best
pardner there ever was.

1464
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:09,477
You're the only pardner
that ever was.

1465
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:11,596
That makes me the best.

1466
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:17,838
- You gonna say goodbye to Elizabeth?
- No. I don't think I'll do that.

1467
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:21,879
I'll get melancholy enough later on
without picking up an extra load now.

1468
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:25,878
You say something nice
to her for me, Par...

1469
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,355
What the hell is your name anyway?

1470
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:33,311
Sylvester Newel.

1471
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:39,232
- Sylvester Newel.
- Yeah, just one "l".

1472
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:42,036
That's a good name for a farmer.

1473
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,549
- So long, Pardner.
- So long, Ben.

1474
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:58,117
Never liked a man
as much as I liked you.

1475
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,511
Ben says goodbye, Elizabeth.

1476
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:38,435
Aren't you going with him?

1477
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:49,916
No, I'm not going anywhere.

1478
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:04,832
Do you think
he'll be all right, Pardner?

1479
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:08,917
Where's he going?

1480
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:12,709
Where am I goin'? I don't know
Where am I headin'? I ain't certain

1481
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:16,270
All I know is I am on my way

1482
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:20,035
When will I be there? I don't know
When'll I get there? I ain't certain

1483
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:23,032
All that I know is I am on my way

1484
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:26,795
Got a dream, boy
Got a song

1485
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:30,509
Paint your wagon and come along

1486
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:34,718
Where am I goin'? I don't know
When will I be there? I ain't certain

1487
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:38,110
What will I get?
I ain't equipped to say

1488
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:42,113
But who gives a damn?
I'm on my way

1489
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:45,795
Where am I goin'? I don't know
Where am I headin'? I ain't certain

1490
02:30:45,880 --> 02:30:49,509
All I know is I am on my way

1491
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:53,229
When will I be there? I don't know
When'll I get there? I ain't certain

1492
02:30:53,320 --> 02:30:56,630
All that I know

1493
02:30:56,720 --> 02:31:00,952
Is I am on my way

1494
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:04,715
Got a dream, boy
Got a song

1495
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:07,189
Paint your wagon

1496
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:10,397
And come along

1497
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:16,195
Where am I goin'?
I don't know

1498
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:19,919
When will I be there?
I ain't certain

1499
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,959
What will I get?
I ain't equipped to say

1500
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:30,395
But who gives a damn?

1501
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:36,749
We're on our way

1502
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:57,559
Where am I headin'? I ain't certain
All I know is I am on my way

1503
02:31:57,640 --> 02:31:59,710
Gold fever

1504
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:03,629
Gold fever

1505
02:32:04,840 --> 02:32:08,594
When will I be there? I don't know
When'll I get there? I ain't certain

1506
02:32:08,680 --> 02:32:10,910
All I know is I am on my way

1507
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,116
Gold fever

1508
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:16,796
Gold fever

1509
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:21,474
Got a dream, boy
Got a song

1510
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:24,916
Paint your wagon
And come along

1511
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:28,470
And get gold fever

1512
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:32,791
No rompin', rollin'
Girl-and-fellow stuff

1513
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:36,156
Can cure the gold fever

1514
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:40,795
Nothin' can help you
But that yellow stuff

1515
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:46,749
What can stop that itchin'

1516
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:50,719
Ain't around the kitchen

1517
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:54,349
Gold, gold
Gold, gold

1518
02:32:54,440 --> 02:32:58,479
Gold

1519
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:02,348
They

1520
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:08,276
Call the wind Maria

1521
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:17,388
Away out here
They got a name

1522
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:21,314
For rain and wind and fire

1523
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:24,949
The rain is Tess
The fire's Joe

1524
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:28,749
And they call the wind

1525
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:33,550
Maria

1526
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:44,072
I was born

1527
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:48,039
Under a wanderin' star

1528
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:51,715
I was born

1529
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:55,998
Under a wanderin' star

1530
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:59,595
Wheels are made for rollin'
Mules are made to pack

1531
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:03,639
I've never seen a sight that
Didn't look better lookin' back

1532
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:07,838
I was born

1533
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:10,992
I was born...

1534
02:34:11,080 --> 02:34:15,517
- A million miles away
- Send back the world

1535
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,593
There's too much night for me

1536
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:24,435
The sky is much too high
To shelter me

1537
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:31,119
When darkness falls
Four cabin walls

1538
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:36,354
Would be just right for me

1539
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:55,869
A million miles away

1540
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:59,999
Behind

1541
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:04,437
The door

1542
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:42,799
Where am I goin'? I don't know
Where am I headin'? I ain't certain

1543
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:48,997
Gold fever
Gold fever

1544
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:54,392
All that I know is I am on my way

1545
02:35:56,120 --> 02:35:59,669
You want to see sin
Of the wickedest kind? Here it is

1546
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:03,548
You want to see virtue left behind?
Here it is

1547
02:36:03,640 --> 02:36:05,710
Sodom was vice and vice a versa

1548
02:36:05,800 --> 02:36:07,791
You want to see where
the vice is worser?

1549
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:11,316
Here it is
I mean, here it is

1550
02:36:11,400 --> 02:36:15,029
You want to see life
In the rottenest way? Here it is

1551
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:18,954
Women and whisky night and day
Here it is

1552
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:21,110
You want to embrace
The golden calf

1553
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:26,593
Ankle and thigh and upper half?
Here it is, I mean, here it is

1554
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:29,672
I don't know
Where am I headin'? I ain't certain

1555
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:33,036
All that I know is I am on my way

1556
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:34,951
Gold fever

1557
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:38,717
Nothin' can help you
But the yellow stuff

1558
02:36:41,160 --> 02:36:44,994
What can stop that itchin'

1559
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:48,709
Ain't around the kitchen

1560
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:52,429
Gold, gold, hooked am I

1561
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:55,592
Susannah, go ahead and cry

1562
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:22,993
A million miles away

1563
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:29,995
Behind

1564
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:35,512
The door
