1
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,090
I'd like another shot
at that prize money.

2
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,442
- Okay for next Sunday?
- No, Jim. It ain't okay.

3
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,403
- Now, look, Bice...
- No, you look.

4
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,646
All of my drivers
are 18, 19.

5
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,284
You're too old
for these kid snorts.

6
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,321
You're liable
to get hurt in there.

7
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,079
You used to be a big track driver.
Ain't you got no pride?

8
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,566
I ran out of pride
when I ran out of cars.

9
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,840
Jim, you gotta look
at yourself.

10
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,928
Okay, you start out all right.
You win a couple of tracks,
you think you're on your way.

11
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,769
But it didn't
work out, did it?

12
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,202
- Much obliged.
- You need any money?

13
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,567
Nope.

14
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,329
Hey.

15
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,805
What do you do
with this stuff?

16
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,398
It's for a friend.

17
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,646
Hey! How'd it go?

18
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,567
Okay.

19
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,284
- I brought you something.
- Oh, thanks.

20
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,640
Aw, the poor thing.

21
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,567
I'll find a good spot for it.

22
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,681
- You got hurt again.
- So?

23
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,278
One of these days you're
gonna get wiped out entirely.

24
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,327
Why you gotta be a driver?

25
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,964
Maybe that's not
your thing, racing.

26
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,968
How about all those car agencies
down on Van Ness?

27
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,843
I bet a top mechanic there
gets a lot of good bread laid on him.

28
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,767
What is the matter
with everybody?

29
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,687
Can't you understand?
I'm not a mechanic, I'm a driver.

30
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,244
I know just how you feel, Jim.

31
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,282
Hey, I used to think I was
happy painting flower seeds.

32
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,244
Then one day, inside me,
this little voice says,

33
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,440
"Tennessee Steinmetz. "

34
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,482
I said, "What?"
It said, "You ain't happy. "

35
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,762
Tennessee, why is it the only thing
we have in this house is parrot food?

36
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,326
- I mean, we don't have a parrot.
- Eat that. That's good.

37
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,408
That's pressed kelp.
That aerates your liver.

38
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,408
Then this voice inside
of me continued as follows:

39
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,079
"This is nowhere.
Ya gotta make a new scene.

40
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,485
Ya gotta change your bag. "

41
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,680
That's when I split.
I went to Tibet,

42
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,519
to a mountaintop,
with swamis and monks.

43
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,165
I discovered my real self.

44
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,167
It was wonderful.

45
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,839
I don't have
to go to Tibet.

46
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,926
I know who I am.

47
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,242
I know what I want.

48
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,806
There are dirt track races at a carnival
near Bakersfield this week.

49
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,161
If I can get over there
I can pick up a couple of bucks.
Okay to use your wheels?

50
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,760
Okay, but you're gonna have
a little trouble getting it started.

51
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,684
Where's the beast?

52
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,119
You didn't
cut up the Edsel.

53
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,761
It came over me
all of a sudden.

54
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,723
It was the only
decent thing to do.

55
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,365
Believe me, Jim,
it'll be happier up there.

56
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,807
Are you all right?
Are you dizzy?

57
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,319
Oh, no. There's a slight
racking pain in my head here.

58
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,887
Oh, well, I think you'd better sit down.
I'm really terribly sorry.

59
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,126
Well, it's not your fault.
I didn't mean to startle you.

60
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,287
Looks like you've been running
into all sorts of things lately.

61
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,686
Yeah. Oh, this
is just a little...

62
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,041
- Oh, lady.
- Oh, really, sir.

63
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,638
Excuse me.

64
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,722
Over 400 cubes.

65
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,479
Dual quads, all synchro box,
zero to 60 under five.

66
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,249
All right, Miss Bennett.
I'll see to this gentleman myself.

67
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,009
May I be of service, sir?

68
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,406
I see that you're a person
who appreciates fine things.

69
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,328
You're no doubt aware that this
is the celebrated Thorndyke special.

70
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,725
Allow me to say, sir,

71
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,762
that I think this car
would suit you very well.

72
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,687
Yes.
Yes, it would.

73
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,519
- May I offer you a glass
of sherry and a biscuit?
- Go right ahead.

74
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,485
I take it the question of price
does not greatly concern
a gentleman like yourself.

75
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,441
Oh, I wouldn't haggle
if that's what you mean.

76
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,845
What price range
did you have in mind?

77
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,688
About $75.

78
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,769
$75.

79
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,165
I could go 80 in a pinch.
What do you have in the way of
cheap, honest transportation?

80
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,850
Cheap, honest transportation!

81
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,967
I will bid you good day, sir.

82
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,046
Good day.

83
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,365
Hey!

84
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,526
Havershaw!

85
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,245
Now, where did
this come from?

86
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,045
- Mr Thorndyke, yes, sir?
- What is this thing
doing in my showroom?

87
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,286
I believe Miss Bennett
may know something about this.

88
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,369
Yes. You remember when Mrs van Luit
purchased her new Bentley?

89
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,641
She also requested us to buy
a small used car for her upstairs maid.

90
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,240
Then why isn't her upstairs maid
in her blasted vehicle?

91
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,167
The car was returned
this morning, Mr Thorndyke.

92
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,565
She was having some kind
of difficulty with it.

93
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,487
- Get it out of here!
- Yes, sir.

94
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,921
What's that for?

95
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,202
- I beg your pardon?
- Why don't you let the little car alone?

96
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,039
Are you presuming to tell me
what to do in my own establishment?

97
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,400
Okay, I'm out of line.

98
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,760
It just bugs me to see somebody
abusing a decent piece of machinery.

99
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,246
How fascinating.
Well, now that we've had the
benefit of your point of view,

100
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,520
shall we regard our relationship
as terminated?

101
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,960
Havershaw!
Get this eyesore out of my showroom.

102
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,887
And if ever I find it here again,

103
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,649
someone is going to find himself
in a great deal of trouble!

104
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,125
Yes, sir. Of course.
Boys, here we go.

105
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,969
Here we go.

106
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,928
- Sorry. None of my business, is it?
- Perfectly all right.

107
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,929
- Goodbye.
- Oh. Goodbye.

108
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,200
- Good morning.
- Good morning. What do you want?

109
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,243
- Police.
- Right. What do you want?

110
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,840
Forgive me for pointing,
but have you ever seen that car before?

111
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,566
- No. No, I haven't.
- Hey, he's a cute little fella.

112
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,362
Hey, wait a minute.

113
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,166
Wait a minute. I think I saw
that car at an agency yesterday.

114
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,850
Now, permit to inform
you of the following:

115
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:29,203
First, say nothing that would
jeopardize your constitutional rights.

116
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,844
Second, the minute
you get downtown,

117
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,882
I would advise
you get a good lawyer.

118
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,526
- Shall we go?
- Go? What for?

119
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,200
On suspicion of grand theft.

120
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,687
Now, wait a minute.
There's something cockeyed about this.

121
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,607
How did that little
car get here?

122
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,520
I share your curiosity.
Shall we go?

123
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,360
I'll do it.
Okay, I'll do it.

124
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,768
But I want to go on record. I have seen
some crummy stunts used to sell cars,

125
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,960
but this beats everything.

126
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,558
To plant this Bug
in the possession of an innocent man
and accuse me of stealing it!

127
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,487
How dare you, sir!

128
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,487
Are you suggesting I would
stoop to such tactics?

129
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,646
That's exactly
what I'm suggesting!

130
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,807
In the first place, it might
interest you to know that
under normal circumstances,

131
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,160
I would never sell a car
to someone with whom I'm not,

132
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,804
shall we say,
socially compatible.

133
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,886
- You'd sell a car...
- Please! Let's not
go through that again.

134
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,841
I think we've worked
it out very well.

135
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,359
Mr Douglas needs a car,
and for a very low amount down...

136
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,483
and the usual monthly payments,
the car will become his.

137
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,205
Very well, even though my inclination
is to have Mr Douglas clapped into jail,

138
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,480
and this four-wheeled contrivance
dropped into the bay!

139
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,240
- I think Mr Thorndyke
is being very fair.
- Fair? It's not fair!

140
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,168
I'm being muscled! I want you to know
that I know it and I don't like it!

141
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,803
I'll draw up the papers.

142
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,047
Would you come
with me, please?

143
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,445
Then get Mr Douglas
and his acquisition out of here...

144
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,640
before I lose my temper!

145
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,807
What in...

146
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,842
What's the matter?
You from L.A. Or something?

147
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,600
- I thought we'd run over to that
new restaurant in Marin County.

148
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,886
Have you gone mad?

149
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,570
Okay.
What's the joke?

150
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,885
- What do you mean?
- I don't know how you rigged it,

151
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,320
- but I'm sure that car's a real cutup
when a convention comes to town.
- What in the name...

152
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,520
If I'd wanted a trick car
I would have bought one in a joke shop.

153
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,608
Allow me to say I haven't the slightest
idea what you're talking about.

154
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,085
You come blithering up in
that beastly little car...

155
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,360
and assault
my personal Rolls Royce!

156
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,287
I brought it back.

157
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,446
I want my money,
I want the papers I signed,

158
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,006
then I'll get out and you two clowns
can have your little laugh.

159
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,485
Mr Douglas, if there is
anything wrong with the car,

160
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,408
would you be good enough
to tell me what it is?

161
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,284
It's just that that it wants to go
one way and I'd like to go the other.

162
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,483
- Whatever it is, none of it
is covered in our guarantee.
- I'm sure of that.

163
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,522
- If you examine paragraph 12...
- Excuse me, Mr Thorndyke.

164
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,245
If I sold this gentleman the car
I feel a certain responsibility.

165
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,964
Do you mind if I try it?

166
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,489
Miss Bennett!
Our dinner engagement.

167
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,407
I won't be a minute.

168
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,560
Seems to be acting
all right now.

169
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,127
Sometimes new car owners have a tendency
to exaggerate their problems.

170
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,241
We get that all the time.

171
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,804
Believe me, when I was
in this car alone...

172
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,400
Just treat it gently at first.
It really is a fine automobile.

173
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,080
Have you had much
experience with cars?

174
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,166
Look, lady, by profession
I'm a racing driver.

175
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,646
Oh, that Jim Douglas.

176
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,125
What do you mean,
"That Jim Douglas"?

177
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,639
Let's see, two years ago
at Laguna Seca...

178
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,082
you spun out and hung a beautiful
Buick Special on the back fence.

179
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,646
At Willow Springs,
a year ago last February,

180
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,920
you sprayed a Lotus
all over the infield.

181
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,564
How do you know all that?

182
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,487
I have trouble
with names and faces,

183
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,726
but I never forget a car.

184
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,000
I like good machinery.

185
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,927
Now, why don't you give
this little car a fair chance.

186
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,008
You bought it; enjoy it.

187
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,325
You can drive me back now.

188
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,167
What about it, dad?

189
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,441
Want to give that doodle bug a workout?
I'll go easy on ya.

190
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,162
Be serious, will ya?

191
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,199
- Did you see this thing take off?
- One of your showboat tricks.

192
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,924
I tell you, I had nothing to do with it.
Hey, we were turning.

193
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,520
Outta sight, man.
I wouldn't have believed it.

194
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,447
Groovy, pop. Groovy.

195
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,607
As long as the customer
finally seems pleased,

196
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,164
I'll just step out
and find myself a taxi.

197
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,442
Will you stop the car, please?

198
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,528
I'm trying!
Look!

199
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,245
It's just like I told you.
This thing's starting to act up again.

200
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,045
How very odd. When I was driving there
was no problem whatsoever.

201
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,447
I can't seem to do
anything with it!

202
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,165
Mr Douglas, I'm asking you nicely
to pull over and let me out!

203
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,520
Look, I'm sorry about your date,
I really am.

204
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,880
I didn't want you to miss
your dinner engagement.

205
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,928
What's the rush, tiger?
We got all night.

206
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,848
Goodbye, Mr Douglas.

207
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,567
Here, I'll help you.

208
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,840
I can get out, thank you.

209
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,279
What'll it be, chief?

210
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,163
Would you mind helping the lady
get her car door open?

211
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,362
Look, I'm busy.
And I ain't no mechanic.

212
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,041
All I do is sell food,
and that ain't too good.
You want somethin' or don't ya?

213
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,764
- Help!
- Two hamburgers and a coffee.

214
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,287
Help!

215
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,083
Can you help me, please?

216
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,327
Help! I'm a prisoner!
I can't get out!

217
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,840
We all prisoners,
chickie baby.

218
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,801
We all locked in.

219
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,927
Mmm.

220
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,120
A couple of weirdos, Guinevere.

221
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,006
What? Wait a minute.
Hold it, hold it.

222
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,927
Let me open the door.

223
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,847
Hey, knock it off,
will ya, sis?

224
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,767
I ain't sayin' this is
the classiest joint in town,

225
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,687
but we gotta draw
the line somewhere.

226
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,607
Come on,
back in your seat.

227
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,359
Why don't you go
up to Seabreeze Point?

228
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,640
- Fuzz don't bother you much up there.
- Thanks.

229
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,723
I wish there were some way
I could make up for those hamburgers.

230
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,966
Mr Douglas, please
don't go on about it.

231
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,719
I'm sure that if I were driving none
of these things would have happened.

232
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,567
It's all yours.

233
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,198
Now I think you'll
see what's what.

234
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,963
This is very embarrassing.

235
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,526
Yes, it is.

236
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,279
- I would have preferred knowing
you a little longer first.
- Just a minute!

237
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,325
- You don't think I drove
you here on purpose.
- Don't try to explain.

238
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,203
- The point is you brought me here.
- I did not bring you here!

239
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,720
It's this nasty little car.

240
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,001
- But you said yourself
it's a very nice little car.
- And as you said,

241
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,927
it does have some
peculiar traits.

242
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,166
And I agree with you completely.

243
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,124
- Bring it in tomorrow
and I'll find a replacement.
- I don't want the car replaced.

244
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,005
As a matter of fact,
I'm beginning to like it.

245
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,439
- Oh!
- Don't panic.

246
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,562
Don't panic. There must be
some place I can call a taxi.

247
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,800
Ooh!

248
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,682
Hey!

249
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,843
You know, for a moment
I thought you weren't going to stop.

250
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,643
What's the matter now?

251
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,405
Look, this is ridiculous.
Let's get back in the car, huh?

252
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,801
Hold it.
Hold it, everybody.

253
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,807
Just a moment, please.

254
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,007
Something the matter?

255
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,008
- Is this man bothering you?
- No, not exactly.

256
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,327
It's okay.
We're together.

257
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,204
- Is that your car?
- My...

258
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,890
Well, yes.
Yes, it is.

259
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,241
Okay, then.
Move along.

260
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,003
- Hey, bud.
- Yeah?

261
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,564
Not too smart
wandering around the park at night.

262
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,569
- Right.
- I'll drive.

263
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,920
She'll drive.

264
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,643
I should have given
you a citation.

265
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,567
You ought to have enough sense
to put your brakes on...

266
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,920
while your car is stopped!

267
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,608
Well then, if everything you say
about this car is true,

268
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,800
it's already
starting to happen.

269
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,081
- What's starting to happen?
- Us human beings.

270
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,770
We had a chance to make something
out of this world.

271
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,801
We blew it.
Okay.

272
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,128
- Another kind of civilization
is gonna take a turn.
- Give me an 11-mil wrench.

273
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,684
- I'm sitting up
on top of this mountain, right?
- Right.

274
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,359
- I'm surrounded by these gurus
and swamis and monks, right?
- Right.

275
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,287
- I'm lookin' at my stomach.
- Yeah.

276
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,562
- I'm knockin' back a little rice wine.
- Um-hmm.

277
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,399
Got some contemplation goin';
I see things like they are.

278
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,998
- I coulda told you all this was comin'.
- What's coming?

279
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,406
Jim, it's happening right under
our noses and we can't see it.

280
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,284
We take machines
and stuff 'em with information
until they're smarter than we are.

281
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,207
Take a car.

282
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,879
Most guys spread more
love and time and money...

283
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,844
on their car in a week than they do
on their wife and kids in a year.

284
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,767
Pretty soon,
you know what?

285
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,281
The machine starts
to think it is somebody.

286
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,846
I'm not saying a mechanical thing
can't be a friend.

287
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,926
Like, when I was
broke one summer,

288
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,328
there was this giant claw machine
in the Sutro Amusement Park.

289
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,159
It would grab cameras and watches
and drop them down a hole to me.

290
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,804
- And I would hock 'em and buy lunch.
You follow me?
- Yeah.

291
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,002
I think you were up
on that mountaintop too long.

292
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,488
Contrariwise, the traffic light
down the street hates my guts.

293
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,044
I don't know why.
But in the last six weeks...

294
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,320
I haven't caught anything
but a stop signal.

295
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,726
It makes me wait six seconds longer
than anybody else! I timed it!

296
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,162
Things like that happen
to lots of other people too.

297
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,087
But the other people
don't tell no other people,

298
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,203
because the other people
would say, "Hey-ey-ey-ey. "

299
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,960
Tennessee, that traffic light
is a lot of nuts and bolts.

300
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,126
This little car,
a lot of nuts and bolts.

301
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,640
Everything explains itself,
one way or the other.

302
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,682
- You're not listenin' to me.
- Don't lose your grip, old buddy.

303
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,801
This little car didn't do one thing
tonight that can't be explained...

304
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,559
in terms of short circuits, sprung
doors, grabbing steering, worn knuckles,

305
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,806
maybe some advertising gimmick.

306
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,046
I'll fix it.

307
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,048
- I don't think you got the picture.
- I got a beautiful picture.

308
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,604
This baby happens to have
an extra turn of speed,

309
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,198
which is the only thing
I care about.

310
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,207
You don't understand
what happens, do you?

311
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,561
They make 10,000 cars.
They make 'em exactly the same way.

312
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,682
One or two of 'em turn out
to be something special.

313
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,484
Nobody knows why.

314
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,407
I know why.

315
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,646
I may be kiddin' myself,

316
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,364
but I think I can make somethin'
out of that sad little bucket of bolts.

317
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,766
Save these.
They'll be famous someday.

318
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,249
I'm your friend.

319
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,439
Wanna take a ride? I want to check
those adjustments I made last night.

320
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,845
- Okay.
- Be right with you.

321
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,041
Hey! Hey, come here!

322
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,524
All right, get outta there. Out!

323
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,005
Come on.
Who do you guys think you are?

324
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,880
Stop clownin' around,
will ya?

325
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,320
Play it straight.
Don't give him any trouble.

326
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,247
You could have
a good home here.

327
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,679
- What's all that racket, huh?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

328
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,607
Oh. Hop in.

329
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,758
What'd I tell ya?
Now it handles good.

330
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,643
- All the bugs are gone.
- Herbie's all right.

331
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,330
- Who's Herbie?
- This little car.

332
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,441
Named after my Uncle Herb.

333
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,209
He used to box middleweight.
Preliminary, mostly.

334
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,924
Gradually, his nose got
shaped more and more...

335
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,439
like to remind me of this little car.

336
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,845
- Do you mind?
- Whatever you say, Tennessee.

337
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,359
Herbie.

338
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,643
- I'll take 'em.
- Thank you, sir.

339
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,806
- Now, what's that for?
- An oil job.

340
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,525
- Huh?
- I got a small knock in my conscience.

341
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,447
Thanks.

342
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,646
Now we get down to business.

343
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,840
- You gonna race?
- What do you think?

344
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,847
Oh, boy!
Won't Herbie love that!

345
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,801
Le Mans, Monte Carlo.

346
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,047
Thrills, glamour,
the roar of the crowd!

347
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,404
He really does drive.

348
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,486
If you could give me one good reason
for bringing me down...

349
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,680
to this ridiculous desert, I...

350
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,844
Isn't that the scruffy little car
we had in the shop?

351
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,367
Now we're goin'!

352
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,203
You're doin' terrific, Herbie,

353
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,798
but don't make it look too easy.

354
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,761
Play it smart.

355
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,960
Okay, Jim! Go ahead!
You're murderin' 'em!

356
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,484
So, who cares?
I'll tell you one thing.

357
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,727
I certainly don't intend
losing any sleep over that absurd car.

358
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,648
Come on. Come on!

359
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,329
Now, Herbie!
Now! Now!

360
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,840
The winner, #53:
Jim Douglas, driving a Class-D Special.

361
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,767
- Congratulations.
- Good race, Jim.

362
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,962
- Thanks, Ray.
- Boy, was Herbie ever great today.

363
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,399
I was out there too. Wouldn't you say
that was a fair piece of driving?

364
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,407
Hey, I'm not trying to take
anything away from you,

365
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,090
but you gotta admit that this little guy
backed you all the way.

366
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,280
Yeah.
It's a nice little car.

367
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,207
You know somethin' else?

368
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,243
For the first time in a long while,
I felt my real self out there.

369
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,328
A sense of authority like
the top drivers have, you know?

370
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,600
I kinda felt you felt that.

371
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,244
Tennessee, I wouldn't admit this
to anybody else, but...

372
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,364
I was beginnin' to think
I'd never be anything more
than a piston-happy, lead foot punk.

373
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,601
Then this starts to happen.

374
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,527
I'm glad for you, Jim.

375
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,606
You know that.

376
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,527
Well, hello.

377
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,006
I see you finally learned how to
handle this car. Congratulations.

378
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,042
- Thank you.
- What have you done to this thing?

379
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,206
Oh, an adjustment here,
an adjustment there.

380
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,446
You want to sell it back?
I own most of it anyway, you know.

381
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,686
Still 23 payments to go.

382
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,607
- Well, uh...
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

383
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,767
I'll take the car and give you
$1,000 clear. What do you say?

384
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,801
No. You don't wanna do that.

385
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,444
It's all right, Tennessee.
I know what I'm doing.

386
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,687
I think Mr Thorndyke
is a little mixed up
as to who or what won that race.

387
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,040
- And what does that mean?
- Someday, I'll teach you...

388
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,400
not to confuse the car
with the driver.

389
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,407
I should welcome the opportunity.

390
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,283
Mr Thorndyke, I think
that's a very good idea of yours.

391
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,799
- What is?
- You're racing in the Libra Open...

392
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,080
- at Riverside
at the end of the month, right?
- Yes.

393
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,007
Well, I'm sure that
Mr Douglas would like to get...

394
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,200
- the remainder
of his payments off his back.
- No doubt.

395
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,002
But why should I think
that's a good idea?

396
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,325
Well, if Mr Douglas
entered the race,

397
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,647
he could bet his share of the little car
against the remaining payments.

398
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,726
What do you say, Douglas?

399
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,843
The winner to become
the sole owner of the car.

400
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,004
A moment ago, you mentioned
teaching me a lesson.

401
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,519
Do I now detect
a note of timidity?

402
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,008
Racing. That's the name
of the game, isn't it?

403
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,439
Win or lose.
Put up or shut up.

404
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,403
- You got yourself a deal, Thorndyke.
- Splendid.

405
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,043
The drivers' meeting is over.
Now, the third race of the afternoon...

406
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,081
will get under way
here at Riverside.

407
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,520
You keep your eye on your friend
in the Bug, my dear.

408
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,447
I'm going to squash him.

409
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,728
Clear the grid, please.

410
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,127
I can't help feelin' yippy.
If anything goes wrong,
we'll lose Herbie altogether.

411
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,526
- I thought you were the guy
with all the faith in this car.
- Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

412
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,925
And now the starter
has his flag in the air.

413
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,325
The engines are started,

414
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,248
and in just a moment,
we'll have the start.

415
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,328
All the cars looking
very smart on the grid.

416
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,760
Drivers in the first row
signifying that they're ready to race.

417
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,848
Their hands extended in the air.
The flag is up, and there they go!

418
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,798
Cars stretching out now. All cars off
the starting grid and through turn one.

419
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,929
Through the S's now.

420
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,881
Down the back straight, well by himself
now, is the #14 car of Thorndyke...

421
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,570
going into the sweeper turn.

422
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:30,046
The rest of the field well stretched out
as they charge down the back straight.

423
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,684
Not yet, Herbie!
Not yet!

424
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,961
The standings in lap 23: Thorndyke,
still leading; Lesser, running second;

425
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,206
and Erwin in third place.

426
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,364
Now, Herbie! Now!

427
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,685
Now, car #53... Douglas...
starts to make a move,

428
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,040
picking up cars
as he goes by car #20.

429
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,719
Into the sweeper,
very hard and fast.

430
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,842
Going through traffic,
passing #23 now...

431
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,201
is car #53... Douglas.

432
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,767
He has just come alive
and is making a challenge in this race.

433
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,802
Passing cars as he goes down
the back straight,

434
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,525
car #53... Douglas...
making his bid.

435
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:33,440
Into the straight now
is Thorndyke, car #14.

436
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:38,849
Now the pressure's on. Douglas in #53
is starting to close on Thorndyke, #14.

437
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,967
Douglas has just come alive...

438
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,285
and is pressing the leader now.

439
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,922
Now making his bid to pass,
but he can't get by.

440
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,202
He's being shut off
by Thorndyke in the #14 car.

441
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,961
Douglas goes slightly off course,
takes out some markers...

442
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,969
and apparently is out of control,

443
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,765
He crashes into the #4 shutoff marker.

444
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,599
Thorndyke continuing on
as the #53 car lets this one...

445
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,527
Now he's making
his reentry!

446
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,161
Look out!

447
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,080
- Hey, nice scoring, champ.
- Thank you very much.

448
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,599
Hey, what a champ.
Way to drive.

449
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,607
Just a moment, Mr Thorndyke.
You don't have...

450
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,085
I demand that this thing
is impounded and checked!

451
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,327
- I tell you there's more going
on here than meets the eye!

452
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,967
Muchas gracias,
señor.

453
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,445
Gracias.
A usted tambien.

454
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,640
¡Ya consiguió un gorrito
el pelado!

455
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,682
¿Cómo está maestro?
¡Oye se ríe!

456
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,403
You don't look well
in these pictures lately.

457
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,522
How could I look well?
I haven't been able to sleep.

458
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,847
That rotten car
is driving me piffy!

459
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,326
Has it occurred to you
it may not be the rotten car?

460
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,248
- Perhaps it's the way Mr Douglas drives.
- Balderdash!

461
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,840
There isn't a driver in the world
who can get that speed
out of a car like that.

462
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,847
No, he's done something to it,

463
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,881
and I've got to find out what!

464
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,807
You've become obsessed
by this whole thing.

465
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,605
There are other cars, other races.
Why don't you just forget it?

466
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,402
My dear child,
how little you know me.

467
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,125
- Yes, Mr Thorndyke.
- Carole?

468
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,925
- How long have you been with us?
- A year and a half, almost two. Why?

469
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,086
I'm afraid I've been
a little remiss...

470
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,885
in not telling you before now how very
well you've proved in all your duties.

471
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,807
Well, thank you.

472
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,889
And, Carole, as I realize
you have the best interests
of this organization at heart,

473
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,729
I want you to accede
to a somewhat unusual request.

474
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,320
Oh?

475
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,680
Peter Thorndyke.

476
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,766
It's for you.

477
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,085
All right.
You can take it here.

478
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,007
Thank you.

479
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,927
Yes, good afternoon.

480
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,561
Oh, I think that
should be quite all right.

481
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,158
Uh, 7:30 will be fine.

482
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,679
Yes. Uh, bye.

483
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,563
- I think I'll...
- I'd like you to see this Douglas,
get to know him.

484
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,443
Who knows? If he has the talents
of which I believe him capable,

485
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,367
perhaps we can give him
the opportunity...

486
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,321
of joining our organization,
racing under our colours.

487
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,044
- But first, we must know
something about him.
- How about tonight?

488
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,001
- Very good.
- At 7:30?

489
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,928
Very good!
Why waste time?

490
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,006
Oh, and Carole,
another thing.

491
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,361
Leave your car. Take the Special.
He likes that one.

492
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,244
Uh, thank you.

493
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,804
I think I ought to tell you that
that was Mr Douglas who just called.

494
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,966
Excellent.
Strike while the iron is hot.

495
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,206
In all honesty,
I should like to point out...

496
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,163
that I agreed to have dinner with him
before you suggested it.

497
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,440
I salute your honesty, my dear...

498
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,687
a quality not necessarily
to be despised.

499
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,847
Thank you.

500
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,120
A very loyal girl.

501
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,526
- Got Herbie all polished out for ya.
- Uh, Carole Bennett called back.

502
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,199
- She's going to pick me up
in the Special.
- You're not takin' Herbie?

503
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,128
He's looking forward to some relaxation
just like you are.

504
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,081
The car is...

505
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,998
- See you later, Tennessee.
- Some thanks
after what Herbie did for you.

506
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,839
Don't let it get ya, Herbie.
Jim didn't mean it.

507
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,120
Don't forget: He isn't the first guy
ever to lose his head...

508
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,047
over a bucket seat
and a paint job.

509
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,209
He'll come to his senses.

510
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,720
- Good evening.
- Sorry. The other rats
are out for the evening!

511
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,318
No, no! Please.
I didn't come by to see Mr Douglas.

512
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,648
- I came by to pay my respects
to that gallant little car.
- Huh?

513
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,364
There it is.

514
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,641
- What a marvel it is, indeed.
- I don't get you, fella.

515
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,126
Oh, come, come, sir. I know
a rare bit of machinery when I see one.

516
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,445
And after all,
who should know it better than I?

517
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,926
I, who have been trounced
time and again by this... this paragon.

518
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,847
You'll forgive me
for saying so, sir,

519
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:45,246
but it does take class to know
when it has been defeated by class.

520
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,363
You know somethin', Mr Thorndyke?
I may have misjudged you.

521
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:53,369
- Well, thank you.
- I've been misjudging
a lot of people lately.

522
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,765
Would you like a drink?
Some Irish coffee?

523
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,926
Specialty of the house.
My own mother's recipe.

524
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,928
- That's very kind of you.
I'd love it. Thank you.
- I'll be back in a jiffy!

525
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,769
That's most kind.
Thank you so much.

526
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:08,759
It's just incredible, isn't it, to think
that this innocent-seeming object...

527
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,122
is, is capable
of such great deeds.

528
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:17,289
How, indeed.

529
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,163
The trick is, always remember
to have asbestos gloves...

530
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,565
when you make coffee this way.

531
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,487
Fascinating. Yes.

532
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,680
Yes. Quite...
Quite fascinating.

533
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,003
Here we go.

534
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,560
Oh. How very refreshing.

535
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,284
Oh, thank you.

536
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,403
- Up the Irish.
- To the little car, a gallant adversary.

537
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:53,239
- And may the best car win at Riverside.
- May the best car win.

538
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,167
Oh, that's very good, isn't it?
Very good, indeed.

539
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,322
- Like it?
- What do you think?

540
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,880
I can't stand that hungry look
any longer.

541
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,966
Take over.

542
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,684
You know what I said to myself
the first time I saw you?

543
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,564
- What?
- I said to myself,
"Now, there's a real lady. "

544
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:35,843
This is how it ought to be...
me and these kind of wheels.

545
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,565
Excuse me asking, but aren't you
doing all right with the little car?

546
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,366
Sure, but can you imagine how
I'd make it with equipment like this?

547
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,926
Is it so important to you?

548
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,406
Without a real car,
I'm only half a man.

549
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,048
What part of Ireland did you say
your mother came from?

550
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,361
Coney Ireland.

551
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,281
I'm going to make some more coffee.

552
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:45,599
Oh, uh, would you like a spot of this?

553
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,767
- I like a spot of anything.
- I'm so sorry.

554
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,926
Now, we're gonna drink to Herbie,

555
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,723
- The greatest little car
in the whole world.
- Yes. Quite right.

556
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,728
- Mm-hmm.
- Hear, hear. Hear, hear.

557
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,683
- To Herbie.
- To Herbie. So sorry about your hand.

558
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,278
I do apologize.
To Herbie.

559
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,525
What do you know?
The engine stalled.

560
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,280
How about that?
The door's stuck.

561
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,119
- Mmm.
- That's how it is with cars sometimes.

562
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,606
- Yes.
- I guess we'll have to wait
and see what happens next.

563
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,688
Well, as someone
very wisely once said,

564
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,722
"That's how it is
with cars sometimes. "

565
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:30,126
- I just said that.
- Oh.

566
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:36,729
I wonder if your reputation
is altogether true.

567
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,920
What's my reputation?

568
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,963
Oh, I've heard that Jim Douglas is only
interested in fast cars and easy money.

569
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,887
Not true.

570
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,841
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,120
- You know something else?
- What?

572
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,969
When the light
hits you just right,

573
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,082
you're as beautiful
as General Grant on a $50 bill.

574
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,407
Oh, dear me.

575
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:15,439
You wanna know the secret
of the little car?

576
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,038
I do, indeed.

577
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,765
- I'll tell ya
the secret of the little car.
- No, no, no. Just a minute.

578
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,199
All right. Tell me.

579
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,685
It's heart.

580
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,244
That's what it is: Heart.

581
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,606
Heart. Yes.

582
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,120
Well, I'm certainly going
to make a note of that.

583
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,406
- Headache gone?
- All gone.

584
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:54,079
Anticipation of victory
is the purest form of aspirin.

585
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:59,204
- This is my day.
- Clear the grid.
Clear the grid, please.

586
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:03,403
- You seem very confident.
- You know, I believe I am.

587
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,925
They leave the
starting grid, going into turn one.

588
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,847
The field's stretching out now.

589
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:20,441
Everybody getting through
turn one very nicely.

590
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,323
Very fine field of cars here.

591
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,682
And coming through traffic now, making a
move, is Peter Thorndyke in the #14 car.

592
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,607
Picking up a few cars
in that turn.

593
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,166
Now he comes by and picks up three
more cars, going into the lead now.

594
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,488
Thorndyke leading this race
in car #14.

595
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,680
Now making a move
is car #53, Douglas,

596
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,519
who also picks up about three cars
as he goes charging through traffic...

597
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,848
and is in hot pursuit
of Thorndyke in the #14 car.

598
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:51,201
As they go down the back straight,
comin' on pretty hard and fast...

599
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,800
is car #53 making the pass.

600
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,364
Attaway, Jimmy boy!

601
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:00,323
Go, Jimmy!

602
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,960
So far, Jim Douglas seems to have
everything pretty much to himself.

603
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,843
He comes through the S's
into turn six well in control...

604
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,048
As they come down the back straight,
Douglas is slowing down...

605
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,401
and Thorndyke goes rocketing by
into the sweeper turn.

606
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,320
It looks as though the Douglas car
is having trouble.

607
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,442
Yes, #53 is fading fast.

608
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,130
It is developing a problem
of some kind.

609
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,922
Come in! Come in!

610
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,565
Come in!

611
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,806
Irish coffee.

612
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,324
I'll be here all night
if necessary.

613
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,406
I can take any amount of this.
Right. There we are.

614
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:48,728
Don't worry, little guy.
You'll be home soon.

615
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,125
There we are.
Right. Right you are.

616
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:55,243
Do you mind standing clear? They want
me on my own. I'll see you in a minute.

617
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:10,849
Poor little fella.
You got a temperature.

618
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,564
Don't worry.
Jim'll be back soon.

619
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:17,239
He never would've left if it
hadn't been somethin' important.

620
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,927
I know. Nothing worse
than an Irish coffee hangover.

621
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,041
That you, Jim?

622
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,841
- Mind if I come in?
- Sure. Come on.

623
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,484
I wouldn't blame you
if you threw me out.

624
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,521
On account of what Thorndyke did?

625
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:42,201
How can I blame anyone? Thorndyke ruined
the little car right under my nose.

626
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,087
- Where's Jim?
- Don't know.

627
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,407
He went out as soon as we got back.
Didn't say a word.

628
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,282
Left Herbie and me flat.

629
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:56,878
Doesn't he take care
of his car after a race?

630
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,966
Can you do something?

631
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,041
Like what?

632
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,048
Well, h-help the little car.

633
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,286
I'm not a mechanic,
but I think it's suffering.

634
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:11,239
- Suffering?
- Please.

635
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,285
- Mind if I use those coveralls?
- Right.

636
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:21,006
Oh, uh, look. I wanna tell you
so you don't have to worry.

637
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,725
I'm not with Peter Thorndyke any more.
I don't think his way.

638
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,410
- Oh, I know that.
- How do you know?

639
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:30,727
Well, Herbie wouldn't like you
otherwise.

640
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,919
Herbie wouldn't like me?

641
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,087
Miss Bennett, I gotta...
I gotta level with somebody.

642
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,407
I can't talk to Jim.
It would destroy him.

643
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,647
You don't know what it was like
before the little car came along.

644
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:48,001
Jim was defeated. It was murder.
He couldn't get a job.

645
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:51,247
He got into trouble.
Everybody was on his back.

646
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:55,079
Then, Herbie came into his life.
Do you remember that day?

647
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,081
I remember.

648
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:01,008
Well, Jim started
winnin' races again.

649
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,803
He got
his self-respect back.

650
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:08,367
What am I gonna do? Tell him that it was
Herbie winning those races, not him?

651
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,762
- Uh, was it Herbie?
- Well, I...

652
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,999
You fix the little car.
I'll tell ya what's goin' on.

653
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:21,121
I didn't know nothin'.

654
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,206
Then I went to Tibet.

655
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,208
I plugged into
this contemplation thing.

656
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:34,128
- How's that sound?
- Like the song of a bluebird.

657
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:40,558
Well, the fuel lines are clean.
The plugs are clean. Wiring checks out.

658
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,487
Looks like we're
in pretty good shape.

659
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:45,363
Herbie and I
sure appreciate it.

660
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:51,038
You don't believe a word I said
about this little car, do ya?

661
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,407
Well, there's always a first time.

662
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,727
I imagine Adam thought woman...

663
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,808
was a pretty funny piece of equipment
when he met Eve.

664
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:05,048
Well, that's a start. You can't believe
it all right away. It takes time.

665
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,284
- Hello there.
- Hi.
- What's this?

666
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,719
- You ever see anything so beautiful?
- Very nice.

667
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,000
What's the big idea?
You already got a car.

668
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,519
- Not after what happened today, I don't.
- Aw, shut up.

669
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:47,245
- You want Herbie to hear you?
- Don't start that again, Tennessee.

670
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,326
Look, the El Dorado is coming up.

671
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,760
There are real cars lined up in there.
I need something that can cut it.

672
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,721
- Herbie's cut it so far, hasn't he?
- Of course he has!

673
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,887
Now hold it, you two. I've done great
with this little car so far,

674
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,844
thanks to a few changes I made,
and if you don't mind,
some pretty fair country drivin'.

675
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,359
But... I gotta
stop kiddin' myself.

676
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:08,722
I need a big, strong car.
Now I got it.

677
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:13,128
Don't pay any attention.
Don't even look at it.

678
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,730
Hello.

679
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,761
Peter Thorndyke here.

680
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,484
Well, well.

681
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,920
Yeah, I know what you did to my car.
You need your brains kicked out.

682
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,086
Oh, you can imagine
how I must feel.

683
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,725
You see, I'm simply not responsible when
I've been drinking. You know how it is.

684
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:35,603
- Forget it, and goodbye.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

685
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:39,882
I understand from a friend of mine that
you purchased a new Lamborghini today.

686
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:44,162
- So?
- I'm also informed that you owe
a great deal of money on it.

687
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:47,680
Now, myself, for sentimental reasons,
I like the little car,

688
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,722
and I am perfectly willing
to increase my previous offer...

689
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,045
and give you $1,500 for it.

690
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,879
Now. Immediately.
I'm in the vicinity.

691
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:00,889
Thorndyke, I don't like you,
but I can use your money.

692
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,841
You got yourself a deal.
Come and get it.

693
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,723
- What do you mean, "A deal"?
- I'm selling the little car.

694
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,205
- You're what?
- Don't make a fuss.

695
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,286
I need the money.

696
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,241
You crumb!
You can't do that to Herbie!

697
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,646
Carole, will you tell him how it is
out in the real world?

698
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,079
Me? Huh! Well!

699
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:23,725
Near as I can figure it,
I'm not too smart either.

700
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,284
I get rid of one heel
just in time to find another.

701
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:30,005
Well, now, what happened to you?
I thought you'd be on my side.

702
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,280
Not when you do something
like this to Herbie.

703
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,559
Has everybody gone nuts
around here?

704
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,000
I can understand how Tennessee feels.
He's just in off a flying saucer.

705
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,166
But you...
I thought you made sense.

706
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:47,363
Something tells me it's very,
very wrong to sell that little car.

707
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:51,039
Thank you for your opinion, but what
am I supposed to do? I need the money.

708
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:54,048
- Tennessee, if I don't sell the car...
- Don't talk to me.

709
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:01,162
I'm s... I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have butted in.

710
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,087
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

711
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,522
As a matter of fact, I don't know...
What are you doing here?

712
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:11,484
I wish I knew.
I really wish I knew!

713
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:17,523
If I weren't so young and innocent,
a certain thought might enter my mind.

714
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:20,448
- Such as?
- Such as you went out
with me last night...

715
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,720
so that Thorndyke could get
a shot at the little car.

716
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,841
Is that what you think?

717
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:27,723
- Got to admit, it's tempting.
- Okay.

718
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:30,125
Okay. You wanna know
what I was doing here?

719
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,320
Well, I felt sorry
about what happened today.

720
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:35,362
So I quit Thorndyke and came over here
like a full-grown idiot...

721
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,526
to find out
if I could make up for it.

722
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,562
Isn't that
"Dial a beautiful thought for the day"?
Very touching. Makes me glow.

723
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,640
I think it's about time someone
told you what the score is.

724
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,169
Tennessee's too tenderhearted.

725
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,485
You really think it was you
winning those races?

726
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:55,080
Yes, I think it was me winning...
What do you mean it wasn't me
winning those races?

727
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:58,327
- Pardon me.
- You want me to tell you something,
my windbag friend?

728
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:01,123
I admit, I didn't believe it
when Tennessee told me before,

729
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,241
but now I see it makes
all kinds of sense.

730
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:06,646
- W-W-What?
- That thimble head of yours
has gotten all swelled up.

731
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,601
You're not winning any of those races.

732
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:11,324
You couldn't win a game of marbles
from a 12-toed myopic rhinoceros!

733
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,918
Will you knock it off out there,
Tennessee? Can't hear myself think.

734
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,848
I'm not out there, crumb.
I'm here.

735
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,847
Well, hold it down. I'll...

736
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,964
Well, then what's this noise?

737
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,081
No!

738
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,048
Stop it! Stop it!
You don't know what you're doin'!

739
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,126
Look! Look what
it did to my car.

740
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,889
- Okay, maybe it was a little jealous.
- Of course it's jealous.

741
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:42,922
It's always been jealous because
I get credit for winning those races!

742
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,838
Go on.
Realize what you're sayin'?

743
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,328
At a time like this,
whatever kind of time it is,

744
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:27,044
I always say that money
serves to ease the pain.

745
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,763
Good evening, my dear.
Here you are, sir.

746
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,962
Fifteen hundred dollars for
the small car, just as I promised.

747
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,887
I note it's not
in mint condition,

748
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,319
but I am nothing
if not always a man of my word.

749
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:44,599
Uh, uh, 2,000.
What about 2,000?

750
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:48,439
It's the least I can do to help
a fellow human at a time like this.

751
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,845
Shall we consider it a deal?

752
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,803
- Two thousand dollars?
- Yes.

753
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:02,084
Two thousand dollars
for that little beat-up car? Why?

754
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:06,249
Well, you could say I have a warm place
in my heart for the dear little thing.

755
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,726
You don't have a warm place on your
whole body. What do you want it for?

756
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:13,081
You don't want it; I do.
Take the money.

757
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,565
- You... You too!
- Now, look, Douglas,
there's no need to be abusive.

758
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,079
- I'm trying to give you some money!
- I don't want your money!

759
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,485
What do you want the car for?

760
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:22,521
You believe it.
You believe it too!

761
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:26,006
- Believe what?
- Jim, it don't matter whether
you believe Herbie or not.

762
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:29,367
Herbie don't believe
in you no more.

763
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,208
Huh?

764
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,807
Where'd he go?
Where is he?

765
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,886
Took off.
What do you expect?

766
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,764
- Well, come on. Let's find him.
- This is a private thing
between the two of you.

767
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,687
Good luck.

768
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:51,803
Herbie?
Herbie!

769
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,404
A rum lot you've
taken up with, my dear.

770
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:08,684
You'd better find that car
before I do, my friend.

771
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:12,325
- Operator.
- Mobile KQX-2942.

772
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,406
I want 567-3998.

773
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,285
Havershaw, I shall
require the personnel...

774
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:21,083
of both our day
and night shifts.

775
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:23,201
We have a small task to perform.

776
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,847
Herbie?

777
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,327
Herbie!

778
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,087
That's it.

779
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,560
Herbie!

780
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,927
Excuse me.

781
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:12,680
- Havershaw, tear it apart!
- All right, boys.

782
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:15,199
You heard Mr Thorndyke.
Tear it apart.

783
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,844
I'm gonna find out what makes it tick!

784
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,168
- After it!
- After it!

785
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,366
Go on!
Grab the brute!

786
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,721
Hang on to it, you fools!
Hang on!

787
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,239
Herbie!

788
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,041
Give me police station.

789
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,081
Hello, police station?

790
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:09,484
Herbie?

791
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,209
Hey, you...

792
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:39,520
- Did a little car come by here?
- Yeah, just did, without payin' the...

793
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,127
No, Herbie, don't!

794
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:02,687
Herbie!

795
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:14,086
Herb, back up!
Herbie!

796
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:17,202
Come on, baby. It's gonna
be a beautiful day tomorrow.

797
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:20,604
Aaah!

798
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:27,042
Herbie, give me some help.

799
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:30,644
Herb?

800
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,886
I can't hang on much longer.

801
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:50,680
Boy, was he lucky.
This little car saved his life.

802
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:52,607
What do you mean,
the car saved his life?

803
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,721
That's what it looked like
for a moment there. L...

804
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:02,248
You know how funny
things can look i-in the fog sometimes.

805
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:06,329
- I think you've been up on that
Haight-Ashbury beat too long.

806
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,128
Swing that light over here.

807
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,567
Aha!

808
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:02,968
- What's that thing?
- It's a dried squid, Sergeant.

809
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,087
Hmm.

810
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:23,400
Here's the damages.
Can you pay it?

811
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:27,045
- I'm sorry. I have no money.
- Then your car will be impounded.

812
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:32,608
My guess is the judge will order you
to sell it at auction
and the proceeds given to Mr Wu.

813
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:35,608
Wait a minute.
May I speak to the gentleman, please?

814
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:38,722
I spent some time up on
a Chinese-type mountain...

815
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:40,681
teachin' English to some of 'em.

816
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,607
You taught English?

817
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,846
Let's don't get personal.

818
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:47,643
It's a matter of talkin'
their language.

819
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:51,604
You have a little feel for tradition
and some courtesy, you'd be surprised.

820
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:54,244
You can unscrew the "unscrutable. "

821
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:56,486
Go ahead.

822
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:20,441
Ah. Ah, ah, ah.

823
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:50,965
Herbie-la!

824
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:52,489
- Herbie?
- Herbie!

825
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:55,607
- Ho!
- Ho!

826
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:59,120
- Things are shapin' up. He's a car buff.
- Good, good.

827
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,559
- Wow.
- What's the matter?

828
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,487
We just got a new problem.

829
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:12,965
He likes the car so much
he wants to keep it.

830
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:19,680
Okay, the car is his, but he has
to let me drive it in the El Dorado.

831
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:22,278
If I win, tell him
he gets to keep the prize money,

832
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:24,446
but he has to sell Herbie
back to me for a dollar.

833
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:27,761
Now you speak my language.

834
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:40,646
Attention: Drivers
and owners report to Mr Granatelli...

835
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,965
at the president's headquarters.

836
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:47,003
Further, you must remain
on the secondary roads
which have been posted for this race.

837
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:49,963
Other than that, we've tried
to reduce the rules to a minimum.

838
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:53,002
Instead of all this technical
namby-pamby there's so much of today,

839
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:57,442
we're putting the emphasis
on speed, endurance and courage,
the way it used to be.

840
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:03,643
As you know, this is
open formula racing. Anything goes.

841
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:05,761
Any style of car
and crew you wish.

842
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:09,121
The object, gentlemen, is to win.
I wish you all the very best of luck.

843
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:17,763
Mr Wu? I understand that you are
the new owner of the Douglas car.

844
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:21,280
As I too am interested in the vehicle,
I took the liberty of looking you up.

845
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:23,560
- Thank you.
- You will therefore forgive me, sir,
when I say...

846
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:26,648
that you are perhaps
not quite as naive as you look.

847
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:29,648
In point of fact,
you are a very shrewd operator,

848
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:32,887
one who has managed to acquire,
by one means or another...

849
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:35,046
legitimate means, of course...

850
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,604
a number of varied enterprises.

851
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:40,722
It is truly written:
One cannot lose 'em all.

852
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,523
In the light of this,
would you entertain a sizable wager...

853
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:45,606
on the outcome of the race?

854
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:50,850
Wager? The goddess of fortune will
always find me her most ardent suitor.

855
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:54,565
Splendid. Splendid. Shall we step
in here? A little more private.

856
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,966
You're Mr Thorndyke.
I've always wanted to meet you.

857
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:00,684
You've heard of me?
How charming!

858
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:05,201
Are you not the gentleman who originated
the idea of small print...

859
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,844
on bottom of automobile
sales contract?

860
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,200
The very same.

861
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:14,323
- A most worthy adversary.
- You are most kind.

862
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:17,522
And now, sir,
the terms of our wager?

863
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:20,118
What would you like?

864
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:23,048
What have you got?

865
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:33,322
- Okay, let's mount up.
- How's our little friend?

866
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,406
- I hope it holds together.
- Holds together?

867
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:38,806
It was so beat up, I had to cut
the frame to straighten it out.

868
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:42,961
Excuse me.

869
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,648
Is this the morning bus to Fresno?

870
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,047
Thorndyke,
this little car goes so fast,

871
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:53,047
we need three people inside
to hold it on the ground.

872
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:56,162
Well, you certainly picked
the right crew. Toodle-oo.

873
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,121
Break a leg, Thorndyke.

874
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:06,641
Havershaw. I trust you've not
been wasting your time.

875
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:14,081
- Spent a few useful moments
with the small car?
- Yes, sir.

876
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:16,166
Based, then,
on what you now know,

877
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:19,600
what would you say are the chances
of victory for the Douglas car?

878
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:23,518
I would say that they range
from slight to impossible.

879
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:27,199
Havershaw, you are a rat
after my own heart.

880
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,890
Thank you, sir.

881
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:32,399
Gentlemen, start your engines.

882
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:37,804
You're giving it a nice ride.

883
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:50,362
Okay to uncurl my toes now?
We past everybody?

884
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:54,085
- Everyone but Thorndyke.
- Let's go to work.

885
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:56,849
They're coming up on us, sir.

886
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,926
Well, we're not
too concerned, are we?

887
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:05,680
Now, Havershaw,

888
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:09,644
aren't we coming to that rather
dangerous oily spot in the road?

889
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:11,567
Coming right up, sir.

890
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:35,640
Come on! Push!
Push, you worm!

891
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,408
Jim, that's water!

892
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:55,880
Here we go!

893
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:00,567
Mr Thorndyke,
that isn't me!

894
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:06,527
Give me something
to wipe my goggles.

895
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:14,403
Havershaw, you ever think
of having a manicure?

896
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:18,163
There they are.

897
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,804
Now watch me
blow them off the road.

898
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:27,401
Who's the guy
in the fur coat?

899
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:32,002
This is no time
for eating, you fool!

900
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:34,246
Where are we?
How far is Chinese Camp?

901
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:39,080
What's the matter with you?
Don't you even know how to open a map?

902
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:16,404
At the moment, the leaders
of the race are approaching...

903
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:18,407
the historic mining towns
of the mother lode.

904
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:21,124
In first position,
as he moves past checkpoint three,

905
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,127
is Jim Douglas.

906
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:25,844
Peter Thorndyke in the Special
has regained his relief driver...

907
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:28,928
and is rapidly making up lost ground
as the two Pacemakers...

908
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:31,928
near the famous old mining community
of Chinese Camp.

909
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:38,640
- Now what?
- I don't know.
We can't be out of gas so soon.

910
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:45,202
Here.
Wait a minute.

911
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:48,561
- I got a suspicion.
- What's the matter?

912
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:52,444
Just as I thought. Water.
They did it again.

913
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:02,128
- Now what do we do?
- Give me the map.

914
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:13,281
All right. It looks like Chinese Camp's
about three miles from here.

915
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:16,208
- Now, if we come down the...
- Hey.

916
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,680
What goes?

917
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:25,449
No sweat, man.
This is Uncle Wu's car.

918
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:28,164
You don't think he'd
let anyone put it down, do ya?

919
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,081
E- Easy, fellas.

920
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:37,364
The Jim Douglas car appears
to have run into trouble.

921
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:40,243
There has been no sign of him
past checkpoint nine.

922
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:42,759
Peter Thorndyke is
refuelling at Chinese Camp.

923
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:58,367
Come on! Come on, will you!
I'm in a hurry!

924
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:01,368
Sure thing.
I tell Father.

925
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:07,848
My father say,

926
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,926
"Hurry is waste.

927
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:13,122
Waste is cracked bowl
which never know rice. "

928
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,959
I don't care how cracked your father's
rice bowl is! What I want...

929
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:33,407
Hey! Some of you people
get over here right away!

930
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,486
Okay, you're on your way.

931
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:39,285
I'm getting out of here.

932
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:42,163
Not full. Can't go yet.

933
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:45,043
Well, just you watch me.

934
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:59,490
As we come to the midway point
in the first day's racing,

935
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:02,044
Peter Thorndyke,
after a delay at Chinese Camp,

936
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:04,479
is beginning to catch up
with the rest of the field.

937
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:27,960
That knocked him off
the Christmas tree, sir.

938
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:39,724
This is our kind of terrain
from here on out. All downhill.

939
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:31,649
How true it is that the best ways
are the simplest ways after all.

940
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:34,568
- That's what I always say, sir...
- Oh, shut up!

941
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:57,924
We should be coming soon to what
is either a rail tunnel or a bridge.

942
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,439
Oh, here's a tunnel.
That must be it.

943
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:26,842
- What are you doin'?
- It's an elevator.

944
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:29,006
But Herbie doesn't fit.

945
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:31,690
Everybody out.

946
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,526
No sign of them.

947
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:39,403
You may open the wine now,
Havershaw.

948
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:46,528
It's chilled the way
you like it, sir.

949
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:49,847
All right, give me a hand.
All together now.

950
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:56,808
To you, sir.
My unbounded admiration.

951
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,364
Thank you.

952
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:02,562
Mmm! You know something
about champagne, sir?

953
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:06,319
Havershaw, if you tell me that
the bubbles tickle your nose,

954
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:08,805
I shall probably kill you!

955
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,604
Get rid of that slop!

956
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,921
Shouldn't that wheel
have come off by now?

957
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:46,884
It's long overdue, sir.
I'm terribly embarrassed by the delay.

958
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:50,400
- I don't know what could...
- Stop whimpering!

959
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:53,647
I'll just give them
a friendly nudge.

960
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,919
Hey, where'd
that wheel come from?

961
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,525
Hold it!

962
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,081
Don't do anything sudden.

963
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:35,883
Is it all right
if I just cry real soft?

964
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:39,161
Carole, put your feet
back here on the bumper.

965
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:42,088
Come on.
Now give me your hand.

966
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:45,088
Just let go. Let go.
Give me your hand.

967
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,600
- I'm trying, but my mind
don't get the message.
- Come on. Come on.

968
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:53,563
Now come right over the top.

969
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:56,521
Atta boy.

970
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:02,046
All right. Let's get the spare wheel on
and get Herbie back on the road.

971
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:10,119
Thorndyke again.
He made a pizza out of it.

972
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:13,726
And now, here in Virginia City,

973
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:16,080
the terminal point for
the first day of the El Dorado,

974
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:18,485
we're all looking down
the road from the west.

975
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:21,124
And actually at any moment now,
we should be seeing the car...

976
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:24,765
that will complete the first half of
the El Dorado, the run for the gold.

977
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:28,200
Up in the judges stand
the judges and the timers are ready.

978
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:32,528
- Just a moment. The first car
is coming in sight right now.

979
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:35,642
He is really flying down the road.
And there he goes by us.

980
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:45,284
You making it all right,
Tennessee?

981
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:48,928
Ohh!

982
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:51,803
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!

983
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:55,002
Whoa!

984
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,927
Stop, Jim, will you!

985
01:23:57,050 --> 01:23:59,405
Now, don't anybody breathe.

986
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:05,207
Ready?

987
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:19,486
Aaah!

988
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:41,564
Actually, at this hour
only one car is unaccounted for.

989
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:44,124
There's been absolutely
no word of the Douglas Special,

990
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:47,879
which figured so very prominently
in the early stages of the race today.

991
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:52,561
Well, I see the judges are closing down
for the night, and, by golly, so are we.

992
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:55,409
But we'll return to the El Dorado
at 7:30 tomorrow morning...

993
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:59,239
to bring you the start of the second and
the final lap back to Yosemite Valley.

994
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,167
Good night, everyone.

995
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:25,683
A little bird's nest soup
never hurt anyone.

996
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:27,448
Thank you.

997
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,246
Oh, thanks.
I hope this holds together.

998
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:34,361
I'm puttin' welds
on top of welds.

999
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:51,079
Mr Wu, the wiring
is mostly all burned off.

1000
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:56,159
The cylinder walls are scored;
the carburettor's a mess;
the body's sprung.

1001
01:25:56,290 --> 01:26:00,044
This little car ripped itself to pieces
trying to get us here.

1002
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:02,286
It gave us everything it's got.

1003
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:05,368
Now, maybe we can patch it
back together. I don't know.

1004
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:08,687
But how can I send it back
into that rat race tomorrow?

1005
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:11,199
It's got nothing left to give.

1006
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:20,604
It's your car.
What do you say?

1007
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:30,247
A wise man once said,

1008
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:32,930
"When you come to last page,

1009
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:36,486
close the book. "

1010
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:21,443
You let that little car
get under your skin, didn't you?

1011
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,845
I don't know.

1012
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:29,600
There's a lot of gloop
been written about, uh,

1013
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:32,608
the bond between a man
and his automobile and...

1014
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:37,402
how he hates it sometimes,
mostly how he loves it.

1015
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:41,121
He showers gifts on it...

1016
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:45,289
in the way of accessories
and all that.

1017
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:49,847
He gets hysterical if somebody
scratches the paint or...

1018
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:54,088
makes it lose face
on the freeway.

1019
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,919
Maybe some of those feelings
got into the machinery. I don't know.

1020
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:02,563
Tennessee thinks so.

1021
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:04,965
Don't you?

1022
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:09,762
There is something real
about that little car,

1023
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:14,322
something that
doesn't even have a name.

1024
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:21,923
What I don't understand is, out of
the millions of people in the world,

1025
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:25,406
why it picked a dogeared
second-rater like me.

1026
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:32,681
You stood up for it once.

1027
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:35,449
I guess it thought you were...

1028
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:38,084
worth belonging to.

1029
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,925
I understand that.

1030
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:03,720
Ah, Douglas.
Didn't mean to disturb you.

1031
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:06,239
- We'll just take the car and go.
- What are you talking about?

1032
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:08,645
I understand that you
are out of the race.

1033
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:11,045
What does that have
to do with you?

1034
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:13,730
Speaking as the new owner
of the car,

1035
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:16,284
I'd regard your question
as impertinent.

1036
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:19,846
- I'm going to hoist it up
and drag it out.
- Hold it!

1037
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:22,723
Who said you were
the new owner of the car?

1038
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:25,410
Perhaps Mr Wu would like to explain
how he wagered the car...

1039
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:28,044
on the outcome of the race.

1040
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:33,198
Even as you, I believed in the car;
I thought it would win.

1041
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:36,646
More honestly,

1042
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:40,046
I could not resist the odds.

1043
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:43,765
Thank you.

1044
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:47,803
Good sir, would you say
that this is a compact car?

1045
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:51,686
You do not answer.

1046
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:54,563
Well, let me tell you that
you have never seen a compact car...

1047
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:57,079
until you see what
I'm going to do with this.

1048
01:29:57,210 --> 01:30:00,520
Mr Douglas, I have a friend
with a claw-and-hook...

1049
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:03,528
auto wrecking company
in San Francisco,

1050
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:06,118
and he's going to work
on your car.

1051
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,480
Maybe he'll transform it
into a birdbath.

1052
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:12,842
Or what about a nice doormat
so I can wipe my feet on it every day?

1053
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,007
It's too bad this thing
doesn't have the gumption...

1054
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:18,439
to get up to the starting line
this morning.

1055
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,800
I should have enjoyed beating it.

1056
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:23,364
- Ohh!
- Why, you!

1057
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:25,720
Take your hand...
Get your hand off...

1058
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:52,362
Stop! Herbie, stop!

1059
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:55,368
Hey, you know something?

1060
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:57,446
Small car very angry.

1061
01:30:57,570 --> 01:31:00,038
And very strong.

1062
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:02,365
The strength of 40 horses.

1063
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:05,527
What do you think
about that race coming up?

1064
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:08,005
You know, I think now...

1065
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:12,328
is chance to remove
egg foo yung off of face.

1066
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:15,567
Well, this morning, the second
and the final lap of the El Dorado.

1067
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:19,285
From Virginia City to Yosemite,
the run for the gold.

1068
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:21,844
Out there we see in first position
and all ready to go...

1069
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:25,679
Peter Thorndyke
in his Thorndyke Special.

1070
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:37,768
Hey!

1071
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:40,927
These mechanics have done a real
fine job in keying these engines up.

1072
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:43,769
Come on, baby. Come on.
Save it for the race.

1073
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:46,324
One more foul-up like this,
Douglas, you're disqualified.

1074
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:50,085
It seemed to be trying
to get at us, sir.

1075
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:53,600
Of course it was, Havershaw!
There's no use trying to blink the fact.

1076
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:55,721
It's either us or it this time.

1077
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:05,249
We're now getting reports
from our checkpoint number 14.

1078
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:07,679
This one tells us
that the Thorndyke car...

1079
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:10,483
is still holding first position
at this time.

1080
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:12,646
And while here
in Virginia City,

1081
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:15,284
we're preparing to dispatch
the last of our contestants.

1082
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,287
That would be
the Jim Douglas Special.

1083
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:20,880
Hang tight.
This may be a fast takeoff.

1084
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:26,049
Now.

1085
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:05,966
- Good stuff, Herb.
- No more shortcuts like that last one.

1086
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:08,479
Oh, this won't be anything
like that last one.

1087
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:32,165
Thorndyke.

1088
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:34,679
Nice going, Herbie.
We've almost got him.

1089
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:37,040
Hooray.

1090
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:48,129
- What fool laid out these streets?
- But you're driving superbly.

1091
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:53,279
Hey, you got something
against driving on the streets?

1092
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:59,928
- Any sign of them?
- Not a glimmer, sir.

1093
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:07,802
Very well, then. Now I've
finished being Generous George.

1094
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:23,526
He's moving up.

1095
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:35,086
There are times like this...

1096
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:37,963
when I really don't like
myself very much.

1097
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:42,126
What happened to it?

1098
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:45,925
I'd say it's gone for that
last big lube job up yonder.

1099
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:52,327
Ohh! Ohh!

1100
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:55,283
Ohh!

1101
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:22,166
Here it comes again, sir.

1102
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:24,645
Havershaw, I am not
a cowardly man,

1103
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:28,001
but I am beginning to sense
that that thing is out to get me.

1104
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:31,088
Now, now. None of that, sir.
We're not losing our nerve, are we?

1105
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:33,770
Blast you, Havershaw!
How dare you patronize me.

1106
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:35,881
I am not losing my nerve!

1107
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:38,365
No, sir. No, sir.
Of course not, sir. No, no.

1108
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:51,965
I think Herbie did something
to himself that last fall.

1109
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:54,046
What do you mean?

1110
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:57,924
Well... like maybe
he won't hang together much longer.

1111
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:15,970
- What happened to Thorndyke?
- I don't know.

1112
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:18,365
It was like he disappeared.

1113
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:23,800
- Do you hear something?
- It sounds like one of the cylinders.

1114
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:26,603
That's impossible.
The cylinders are in the back.

1115
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:28,925
That's a point
I find puzzling.

1116
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:31,163
Get me out of here!

1117
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:38,126
- Oh, my...
- Get that side!

1118
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,810
Goodness. Oh.

1119
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:45,207
Here.
Turn him around.

1120
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:47,685
Okay, on your way.

1121
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:51,526
Let's go!

1122
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:58,765
Havershaw!

1123
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:03,084
The leaders have now passed
the final checkpoint.

1124
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:06,600
We're now moving outside,
and we should be seeing them
at the finish line in a few minutes.

1125
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:11,201
The word is,
the Douglas car is in the lead,
but the Thorndyke car is moving up.

1126
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:27,200
Uh-oh.

1127
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:30,561
I think we got a problem.

1128
01:37:30,690 --> 01:37:32,965
Carole, turn around.

1129
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:37,682
Grab hold of that strap
and pull.

1130
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:54,043
You okay?

1131
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:56,479
Fine... Look!

1132
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:58,362
There's another one.

1133
01:37:58,490 --> 01:38:00,481
I got it!

1134
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:04,963
- What goes on?
- Just keep drivin'!

1135
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:08,162
Try not to think about
what I'm doing!

1136
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:13,929
Well, that's that. What's... Aah!

1137
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:18,285
I can't weld that!

1138
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:21,606
Give me your hand!

1139
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:25,880
What are we gonna do, jump?

1140
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:28,604
- No! Pull!
- Pull?

1141
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:30,721
Whoa!

1142
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:35,082
Whoa! Jim! Help!

1143
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:39,522
I think you better stop
before someone gets hurt.

1144
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:43,046
No dice.
Herbie doesn't want to stop.

1145
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:50,807
There it is.

1146
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:53,922
I'll bomb the thing off the road
once and for all!

1147
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:15,289
Rotten sportsmanship,
if you ask me.

1148
01:39:15,410 --> 01:39:18,925
Here at the finish, we're still waiting
for our first glimpse of the leaders.

1149
01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:25,041
Yes. Yes,
there they are!

1150
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:28,207
The Thorndyke car now seems to have
a slight edge on the Douglas car,

1151
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:30,446
which is hanging right in there.

1152
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:32,925
You have him now, sir.
Don't falter.

1153
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:35,928
I'm not going to falter,
you dimwit.

1154
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:54,525
Good-o, sir. Good-o.
You can't lose.

1155
01:39:54,650 --> 01:39:56,959
You can't possibly lo...

1156
01:40:19,330 --> 01:40:21,241
W- We won!
We won!

1157
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:23,201
Oh!

1158
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:27,482
The little car takes first...
and third place.

1159
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:29,407
Aaah!

1160
01:40:59,330 --> 01:41:02,447
Do what? Kiss?
You better believe it. Come here.

1161
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:22,367
"Couldn't lose,"
I think you said.

1162
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:25,607
I don't like to remind you, sir,
but if only you'd read the terms...

1163
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:27,846
of that stupid wager
you made with Mr Wu...

1164
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:30,723
Havershaw, you're despicable.

1165
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:40,288
Havershaw, I shan't pretend
that I don't know what you're thinking.

1166
01:41:40,410 --> 01:41:44,369
However, I pride myself
on being a good judge of character.

1167
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:49,689
And when I ask myself,
"Could this man be capable
of such an act of pettiness and...

1168
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:53,759
base ingratitude... "

1169
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:56,165
I accept that as your answer.

1170
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:07,728
- Thanks, Herbie. So long, Mr Wu.
- Goodbye.

1171
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:09,647
- Goodbye, Mr Wu.
- Bye, Tennessee.

1172
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:11,920
So long, Jim.

1173
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:15,042
It's none of my business, but where
are you going on your honeymoon?

1174
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:17,923
We don't know.
Herb hasn't told us yet.

1175
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:20,484
Let's go, Herb.

1176
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:25,486
Goodbye, Herbie.
