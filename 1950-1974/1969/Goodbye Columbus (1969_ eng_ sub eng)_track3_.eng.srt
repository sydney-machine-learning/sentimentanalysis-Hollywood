00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,947
- Would you hold my glasses?
- What?

5
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:06,712
- Would you mind holding my glasses?
- Sure.

6
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:13,760
- I told you not to put my glasses on.
- No, I don't care.

7
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:16,556
- Didn't I buy you your own?
- I don't like them!

8
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:19,097
- These are big for you.
- I don't like them!

9
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:21,166
Come on, I'm gonna tell your father.

10
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:02,127
Come on, Brenda, let's go.
We're late.

11
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:04,430
Coming.

12

<i>Kellish, to the first tee, please.</i>

13

14
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:16,444
Brenda, come on.

15
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:18,414
I'm coming.

<i>Mrs. Sidney Cohen, telephone.</i>

17
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:47,281
Hey, Doris, do you know her?

18
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:49,712
- Why?
- Doris, I give you my word,

19
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:53,115
I won't embarrass you, I promise.

20
00:03:56,691 --> 00:04:00,388
If you call her up, so help me,
I will never ask you here again.

21
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:04,224
So help me. Never again!

22
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:31,020
- Hi, sweetie.
- The playboy from the country club.

23
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:36,721
- Oh, delicious, delicious.
- Don't put the towel on the furniture.

24
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,827
- Where's the phone book?
- Which one?

25
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:45,131
- The suburban phone book.
- Under the leg of the sideboard.

26
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:50,271
- Who are you calling?
- A girl I met today.

27
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:52,378
Oh, Doris introduced you?

28
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,413
She wouldn't introduce me
to the man who drains the pool.

29
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:59,519
Very nice, how you talk about
a cousin. Oh, look what time it is.

30
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:03,157
Your Uncle Max will be home soon,
and I didn't even feed you yet.

31
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:05,849
Aunt Gladys, why don't we
eat together for once.

32
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,927
Sure, I should serve
four different meals.

33
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,725
You eat Jewish pot roast,
Susan with the cottage cheese,

34
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:17,098
Uncle Max has steak. Friday night is
his steak night. I wouldn't deny him.

35
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:19,705
And all I'm having
is a little cold chicken.

36
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:23,605
So I should jump up and down,
up and down, up and down?

37
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,039
What am I, a workhorse?

38
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,908
This may come as a big surprise,
but in some families,

39
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:31,142
everybody sits down at the
same time and eats the same thing.

40
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:33,946
Big shot. Twenty years,
I'm running this house.

41
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:37,124
Is Brenda there?
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

42
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:39,589
Is Brenda there?

43
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:42,490
- Supper's ready.
- Coming.

44
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:47,526
When do you expect her in?
No, this is nobody.

45
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:50,898
- It's getting cold.
- In a moment. Come on.

46
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:55,674
There's no message. No, I'm sorry.

47
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:00,838
Come, sweetheart, eat.

48
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:10,251
Make sure you do that. Keep it
straight. This has got to be straight.

49
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,085
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

50
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:15,922
- I thought you were driving golf balls.
- I drove them already.

51
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,461
OK? There you go.

52
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:21,458
Good girl. Now try it on your own.

53
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,399
- Thought you were driving golf balls.
- Already did.

54
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:26,665
- Having dinner with us?
- I'll eat later.

55
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:28,774
I'm meeting Simp for tennis.

56
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:31,343
Is that my phone or your phone
or Ron's phone?

57
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:35,880
- It's your phone.
- They all sound alike to me.

58
00:06:36,084 --> 00:06:38,348
Hello.

59
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:40,578
Who's calling please?

60
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:43,313
Just a minute. Brenda.

61
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:46,891
- You know anybody named Klugman?
- Klugman?

62
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:50,064
Unless I didn't understand him right.

63
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:51,754
- Hello?
- Carlotta!

64
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,628
You don't know me.
That is, you don't know my name.

65
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:57,999
I held your glasses for you
at the club today. I'm not a member.

66
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:00,697
You asked me to. My cousin
Doris is. Doris Klugman?

67
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:04,036
- Doris?
- She always reads <i>War and Peace.</i>

68
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:07,146
That's how we know it's summer,
Doris reads <i>War and Peace.</i>

69
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:09,782
- What did you say your name is?
- Neil Klugman.

70
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,851
You asked me to hold
your glasses at the board, remember?

71
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:16,854
- What do you look like?
- Well, I'm kind of dark.

72
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:21,017
- Are you a Negro?
- No, I'm a Sagittarian.

73
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:23,792
- See how you like it.
- I'll do it.

74
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:25,898
What do you look like?

75
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,398
Listen, can I pick you up tonight
and show you?

76
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:32,061
- I'm playing tennis tonight.
- How about after tennis?

77
00:07:32,273 --> 00:07:34,537
- <i>I'll be sweaty after.</i>
- I don't mind.

78
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:36,767
- <i>Can I come see you tonight?</i>
- OK.

79
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:40,779
<i>Briarpath Hills. You know</i>
<i>where that is? Around 8:15.</i>

80
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:45,009
I'll be driving a blue convertible so
you'll know me. How will I know you?

81
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:47,477
I'll be sweating.

82
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:50,480
- Come home early.
- Where are you going?

83
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:52,660
- Out.
- Don't forget to lock the door.

84
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,691
- Where are you going?
- Never.

85
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:56,761
- Have a candy.
- Always running.

86
00:07:56,964 --> 00:08:00,730
- Where is he going?
- Don't forget to lock the door.

87
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:04,063
Don't stay out late.
Where is he going?

88
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,800
- He's always running.
- Where is he going?

89
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:00,618
- Game, 5-4.
- Brenda, Brenda!

90
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:03,695
Neil? I want one more game.
I'll be there in a minute.

91
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:07,095
Not necessarily. My serve.

92
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:29,145
Fifteen-love.

93
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:40,028
- It hit the line.
- No, it didn't. It's out.

94
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:44,068
- You're absolutely wrong.
- Do you mind?

95
00:09:44,272 --> 00:09:46,900
All right, go on, go on.

96
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:56,842
My game.

97
00:09:58,286 --> 00:10:00,220
Deuce.

98
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:03,481
Come on, Simp, get going.

99
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:08,188
My ad.

100
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,938
Game. I won.

101
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:21,239
- Neil?
- Hi, hello.

102
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:25,674
- Oh, this is Simp. Neil Klugman.
- Hi. Hi. Great game, great game.

103
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,711
- Can we drop you off somewhere?
- No.

104
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:30,383
I'm perfectly capable
of finding my own way.

105
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:33,076
- Who's Miss Nice?
- Miss Laura Simpson Sokolov.

106
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,687
- Otherwise known as "Simp".
- Why not "Socko"?

107
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,859
Because Simp
is her Bennington name.

108
00:10:39,694 --> 00:10:42,185
- Is that where you go to school?
- No, she does.

109
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:44,364
- Where do you go to school?
- Boston.

110
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,625
- University?
- Radcliffe.

111
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:53,172
- What does cousin Doris look like?
- Doris is dark, and she's...

112
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:56,400
- Is she a Negro?
- We don't know.

113
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:06,582
I guess I don't know her.
Is she a new member?

114
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:10,587
I guess so. They just moved to West...

115
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,124
They just moved to Westchester
a couple of years ago.

116
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,063
Hey, you remember me
holding your glasses now?

117
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,064
Yeah, I think I do.

118
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:24,363
- Do you live in Westchester too?
- The Bronx.

119
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:30,704
- We lived there when I was a baby.
- Say, listen. Wait.

120
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:33,608
How come you rush the net
only when it's dark?

121
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:37,181
Oh, you noticed that?
Simp the Simpleton doesn't.

122
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:39,080
I couldn't figure that out.

123
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:42,313
I don't want to be close
unless I'm sure she can't return it.

124
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:47,222
- Why?
- Because I'm afraid of my nose.

125
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:50,730
- What?
- I had it fixed.

126
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:53,526
- Yeah? What was the matter with it?
- It was bumpy.

127
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,567
- A lot?
- No.

128
00:11:56,771 --> 00:12:00,798
I was pretty, and now I'm prettier.
My brother's having his fixed in the fall.

129
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:03,602
Does he want to be prettier?

130
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:08,271
Sorry, sorry. I don't mean to sound
facetious, but why's he doing it?

131
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,814
Because he wants to.

132
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:14,044
Unless he decides to become
a gym teacher, but he won't.

133
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:15,745
We all look like my father.

134
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:18,687
Does your father wanna have
his nose fixed too?

135
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:22,056
- Why are you being so nasty?
- I'm not nasty. My goodness.

136
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:25,061
I'm suave and sophisticated.
Do I sound nasty?

137
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:31,867
Now, about your nose,
what does it cost to get it fixed?

138
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:36,874
A thousand dollars, unless you
go to a butcher. Why?

139
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,570
Well, I have to see if you got
your money's worth.

140
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:46,910
If I let you kiss me,
would you stop being so nasty?

141
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:11,334
- I don't always do that.
- Why'd you do it now?

142
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:13,137
I felt like it.

143
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,476
Feel like it again?

144
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:20,677
No.

145
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:25,658
Is that the end of our date?

146
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,325
I don't feel like having a date tonight.
There's my house.

147
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:32,230
- Come to the club tomorrow.
- I'm not a member.

148
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:33,661
Be my guest.

149
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:36,336
- What time?
- Two o'clock.

150
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:44,000
<i>Mrs. Jerome Lorry,</i>
<i>Mrs. Jerome Lorry, telephone.</i>

151
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:53,018
Doris, do you know that's
coming out in a comic-book form?

152
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,814
- What are you doing here?
- I'm visiting.

153
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:57,547
Who?

154
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:04,296
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- Oh, I am.

155
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:07,194
You were crazy before,
but you were never pushy.

156
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:09,995
That's my new career.
I'm gonna be a social climber.

157
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:14,072
<i>Elliot Tollger, Elliot Tollger,
telephone.</i>

158
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:16,709
- Hi, come on in.
- Hello. Give me your glasses.

159
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:20,076
I should break
the damn things. I hate them.

160
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:22,340
I should've worn
my contact lenses anyway.

161
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,541
You could have your eyes fixed.

162
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:27,915
- Are you gonna start that again?
- I already did.

163
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,552
Hey, Doris, hold this
for Brenda, will you?

164
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:35,285
I'm not her slave.

165
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,633
Doris, I've wanted to tell you
something for a long time now.

166
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:43,428
You're a pain in the ass.

167
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:47,931
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
After I invite you to the club.

168
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:50,542
That was yesterday.

169
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,371
Well, what about last year?

170
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,242
- Is that Doris?
- Yeah, she's peeling.

171
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:59,476
- Yeah, I noticed.
- She's gonna have her skin fixed.

172
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:03,179
- No, don't do it. Don't, don't...
- I've got something unbelievable.

173
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:19,538
Doris always invites me here
once a year

174
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,608
so my parents can't complain
her parents don't look after me.

175
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:25,938
You mean, you don't live
with your parents?

176
00:15:26,147 --> 00:15:28,615
They moved to Arizona.

177
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:34,618
Arizona? I didn't think anybody
lived there. I mean, any Jewish people.

178
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:36,949
Only cowboys?

179
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:40,389
Yeah, and people with asthma.

180
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:43,085
Which is why they moved there.

181
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:46,833
To be cowboys with asthma.

182
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:49,262
You're so stupid.

183
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:02,039
- That's terrific.
- Why?

184
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:07,415
I don't know. I guess it
gives them a lot in common.

185
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:08,952
Only their asthma.

186
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:12,888
Which is more than most
married couples seem to have.

187
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:14,617
Why does it seem to bother you?

188
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:17,228
- What?
- The subject of marriage.

189
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:18,864
You really notice things.

190
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:22,297
You planning to get married
to somebody in particular? Seriously?

191
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:25,597
Well, I was engaged for a year,
until last week.

192
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:27,330
What happened?

193
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,023
- Hi, Bren.
- What are you so happy about?

194
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:49,526
The Red Sox took two.

195
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,561
We having Carl Yastrzemski
for dinner?

196
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,357
Of course.

197
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:57,594
Every time the Red Sox win, we have
to set an extra place for Yastrzemski.

198
00:16:57,805 --> 00:17:00,797
- Hey, you want to race?
- No.

199
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:03,169
Why don't you go race alone.

200
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,470
- Do you want to go with him?
- No, thanks.

201
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,147
This is Neil Klugman,
my brother, Ronald Patimkin.

202
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,907
- How are you?
- Hi.

203
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:12,777
- You better watch that.
- Yeah.

204
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,118
- Watch that.
- How are you?

205
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:17,950
- You wanna race?
- Not right now, thanks.

206
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:21,286
Race him. I have to call home
and say you're coming for supper.

207
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:24,828
Am I? I've gotta call my aunt.
You didn't say anything about...

208
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:27,796
- I mean, my clothes.
- We dine <i>au naturel.</i>

209
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:31,699
- What?
- Swim, my dear.

210
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:10,434
Julie.

211
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:13,511
Julie, elbows off the table.

212
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:19,550
And eat. Eat your dinner. Millions of
children are starving all over the world.

213
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:24,121
- When's Harriette calling?
- Five o'clock.

214
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:28,591
- It was 5:00.
- Their time.

215
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:31,060
Why is it earlier in Columbus?

216
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:34,291
Suppose you took the plane
back and forth all day.

217
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:37,334
You'd never get older.

218
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:41,699
- Oh, that's right, sweetie.
- Why do you give her misinformation?

219
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:45,743
- Is that why she goes to school?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

220
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:47,914
You know, you're a big
college girl now.

221
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:50,015
Carlotta?

222
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,946
Carlotta, Ronald wants more!

223
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:55,985
- More what?
- More chicken.

224
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,682
- Me too, Carlotta.
- They'll have to roll you on the links.

225
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:03,124
What are you talking about?
Look, I lost a couple pounds.

226
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,662
- Dad, look at this.
- Ronald.

227
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:09,199
- Would you care to bare your middle?
- No, thank you.

228
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:12,895
Well, I'm glad that somebody
is aware of how to behave at the table.

229
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:14,631
- Thank you.
- Chicken?

230
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:17,743
- Oh, no, thank you.
- He eats like a bird.

231
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,045
Come on, Carlotta.
I'm playing ball tonight.

232
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,982
- Don't forget, tape your wrists.
- All right, but I got no mobility...

233
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:31,521
Just wear an Ace bandage
and put heat on.

234
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:34,717
Not an important game.
I want you good for the championship.

235
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:37,396
Last year you didn't listen,
same thing happened.

236
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:40,726
- Where do you live, Bill?
- Neil.

237
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,836
- Didn't I say, "Neil"?
- You said, "Where do you live, Bill?"

238
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:47,268
I hate tape. How the hell
can I play in tape?

239
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:49,408
- Don't curse!
- That's right.

240
00:19:50,177 --> 00:19:52,475
- See?
- See what?

241
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,580
- Oh, I was just talking to Bill.
- Neil.

242
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:57,216
Just eat already.

243
00:19:57,418 --> 00:20:01,149
- A little less talking, young lady.
- I didn't say anything.

244
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:04,847
- She was talking to me, sweetie.
- What is this "she" business?

245
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:07,424
That's how you call
your mother today? She? She?

246
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:10,654
If I called my mother "she",
my father would give me a clop.

247
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:16,461
- I got chicken caught in my braces.
- Eat your dinner. We'll clean it later.

248
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:20,834
Do you go to college?

249
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:23,501
What?

250
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:26,308
College.

251
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:31,140
I went into college
before I went into the Army.

252
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:36,186
- Oh, what did you study?
- I was an English major.

253
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,086
- English?
- Literature.

254
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:43,992
- Kind of unusual, isn't it? For a boy?
- Well, he wants to be a teacher.

255
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:48,059
No, no, no, not necessarily.

256
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:51,562
Carlotta, please, I'm gonna be late.

257
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:54,639
It's Harriette! Harriette's
on the phone! Harriette!

258
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:57,834
Carlotta? Is the bicarbonate
still in the downstairs toilet?

259
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:01,572
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, those damn radishes.

260
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,717
Why don't we have coffee
and dessert outside.

261
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:11,254
- Carlotta!
- Yes.

262
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,360
- Bring the chocolate cake outside.
- OK.

263
00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:25,271
It was a wonderful dinner.

264
00:21:30,577 --> 00:21:32,875
Hold on, I can't breathe.
I can't make it.

265
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,571
Go, run. Grab it.

266
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:39,243
Don't stand too far, now.

267
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:42,348
Almost, almost.

268
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:44,148
- Straighten up.
- Well...

269
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:48,419
- Good girl.
- What kind of work do you do?

270
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:50,824
I'm working
at the library at the moment.

271
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:54,057
The public library?

272
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:58,329
I've been there for about a year now,
ever since I got out of the Army.

273
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:06,168
Oh, well, it must be very interesting,
the library business.

274
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:11,775
I don't know. Yeah, I guess so.

275
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:14,818
No, not very.

276
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:18,582
Can somebody please move the car
blocking the convertible? I'm late.

277
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,623
- Is that me?
- I don't know.

278
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,294
I'm blocking the convertible.

279
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:26,262
No, I'm blocking the convertible,
you're blocking me.

280
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,112
- Chocolate.
- Yummy.

281
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
- You don't say "thank you" anymore?
- Thank you.

282
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:51,686
You little doll.

283
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:01,231
Where did she meet him?

284
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:03,630
Who knows? At the club.

285
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:12,673
He eats like a bird.
Come on, let's play.

286
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,376
Probably.

287
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:21,444
That's probably why I did it.

288
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:24,988
- Wanna play? Daddy's tired.
- Yeah, take over for me, will you?

289
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:27,524
Go ahead, go ahead.

290
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:32,028
I haven't touched a basketball
since I got out of high school.

291
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,227
Be good to your daddy,
he's getting old.

292
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:38,336
- No, it's not true.
- Hi, beautiful.

293
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:40,631
Hello.

294
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:44,876
Daddy, I missed.
Can I take it over again?

295
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,911
Certainly. You want to take it
over again, take it over.

296
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:51,711
- I don't let guests win.
- I see.

297
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,185
Finally.

298
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:01,556
- Can I take that over again?
- No.

299
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:04,788
- Daddy?
- Forget it.

300
00:24:04,998 --> 00:24:07,694
What does your friend do
in the library?

301
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:09,368
I haven't the slightest idea.

302
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:18,676
Is that the kind of work
he wants to do?

303
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:21,143
Why?

304
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:22,975
- I won, Daddy!
- Good girl.

305
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:26,016
I won, I won, I won!
I beat him, Daddy!

306
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,813
- Why'd you let her win?
- I didn't, she beat me.

307
00:24:29,022 --> 00:24:32,822
Come on, even Ron lets her win,
and he's a semipro.

308
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:36,621
- That's my baby.
- It's time to go brush your teeth.

309
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,297
- Ten more minutes.
- It's late.

310
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:42,696
- Oh, ten more minutes, please.
- It's late. You know what time it is?

311
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:46,236
- So? She'll sleep ten minutes later.
- Oh, Ben.

312
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,169
My <i>tsatskeleh,</i> right?

313
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:51,300
Wanna take a drive
or go to the movies? What?

314
00:24:51,511 --> 00:24:53,342
Oh, I don't know.

315
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:56,141
- Brush your teeth and be good.
- OK.

316
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:07,985
Leave her alone.
She'll get tired of him.

317
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:26,175
Klugman? Klugman,
can I talk to you a minute?

318
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:28,370
Would you take
the main information desk?

319
00:25:28,582 --> 00:25:31,210
Ericson called. His mom's
not well, he can't come in.

320
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:35,115
There's always something. Always.

321
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,290
Hi, sweetie. How are you?

322
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:03,010
Hey, mister, where's the art section?

323
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:06,708
- The what?
- Art section.

324
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,518
- Spell it.
- A-R-T.

325
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:13,454
Art. You mean art.
You mean art books, reproductions.

326
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,357
- Yeah, them.
- We got them in a lot of places.

327
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:21,125
- Which artist are you interested in?
- All of them.

328
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:26,268
OK, I'll tell you what you do.
Walk all the way across the floor there.

329
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:29,306
- You see that staircase over there?
- Yeah.

330
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:32,342
Now, you take that staircase
up one flight,

331
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:35,606
and you follow the arrow
to where it says "stack three".

332
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:38,512
Can you remember that?
Stack three?

333
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:41,414
Someone up there
will show you the way.

334
00:26:42,956 --> 00:26:45,083
Go ahead, it's all right. Go ahead.

335
00:26:49,496 --> 00:26:52,693
- What'd you let him in for?
- It's a public library.

336
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:56,300
You know where I found him?
In the stacks looking at the nudes.

337
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:58,698
He was hiding there all morning.

338
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:01,840
- Did you throw him out?
- Of course I threw him out.

339
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:05,876
- You know what those boys do there?
- John, I don't think they do it there.

340
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,014
They do so, I've seen them.
Not out in the open, of course,

341
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:12,777
- but you can tell what they're doing.
- Why don't you let him alone.

342
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:17,452
I'm gonna see Mr. Scapello and
tell him to send somebody to get him.

343
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:22,685
John... Gloria, Gloria, watch
the desk a minute, will you? John?

344
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:24,989
John, John.

345
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:29,294
You want to give Mr. Scapello an ulcer
after his egg-and-pepper sandwich?

346
00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:34,337
- I'll get him. I gotta go there anyway.
- It's disgusting, what they do up here.

347
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:35,838
Don't worry about it.

348
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:40,308
They're the ones who are gonna get
warts all over their dirty little hands.

349
00:27:57,898 --> 00:28:01,163
Hey, mister, where's this place?

350
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:14,040
That's Tahiti.
It's an island in the Pacific Ocean.

351
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:17,444
That ain't no place you
could go, is it? Like a resort?

352
00:28:18,518 --> 00:28:24,286
You could go there, I suppose.
It's very far. People live there.

353
00:28:29,095 --> 00:28:32,292
Look at this one.
Man, ain't that the life.

354
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:34,592
Who took these pictures?

355
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,895
No, he didn't take them.
He painted them.

356
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:40,732
Paul Gauguin. He was a Frenchman.

357
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:44,206
Is he a white man or a colored man?

358
00:28:44,945 --> 00:28:46,776
He's white.

359
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,107
Oh, I knew that.

360
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:55,154
Hey, look at this one.

361
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:58,290
<i>Man, ain't that the life?</i>

362
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:02,291
<i>Yeah, it sure is.</i>

363
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:08,496
There he is. Hey.

364
00:29:08,702 --> 00:29:10,670
- Hurry or we'll miss our plane.
- OK.

365
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,600
You're gonna sit with Julie
because Carlotta's off.

366
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:15,206
What do you mean?

367
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:18,309
We're taking Ron to the airport.
Julie doesn't wanna come.

368
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:20,741
We'll be right back.

369
00:29:20,947 --> 00:29:22,847
In a minute.

370
00:29:28,154 --> 00:29:31,089
Hey, do I get all the cake
and milk I want?

371
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:46,166
Close the door.
There's air conditioning.

372
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:06,318
I'm glad you've decided
you're gonna stay with me.

373
00:30:06,526 --> 00:30:09,654
- So am I.
- Wanna play five-and-two?

374
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:12,991
- No.
- Why not?

375
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:22,037
- Wanna read a book report I wrote?
- No, not now.

376
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:24,870
- What do you want to do?
- Why must we do anything?

377
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:30,015
- Why don't you go watch television.
- All right.

378
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:14,580
You better wash that,
or you'll get diarrhea.

379
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:17,916
They're not washed yet.

380
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,560
- Where's Ron going?
- Columbus.

381
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,631
- What for?
- To see Harriette. They're in love.

382
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:33,565
- What did you do with the cherries?
- What cherries?

383
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,101
You put them in your pocket.

384
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,839
- Wanna play Ping-Pong?
- Can I serve?

385
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:41,707
Yeah, when it's your turn to.

386
00:32:54,394 --> 00:32:57,022
Can I take that one over?
I hurt my finger yesterday!

387
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,097
No, no, come on.
Give me the ball. Come on, come on!

388
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,968
Oh, can? Oh, please, my shoelace
came untied. Can I take that one?

389
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:09,869
Certainly not. Let's go, let's go!

390
00:33:18,952 --> 00:33:21,648
You leaned over the table!
That's not legal!

391
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:25,153
- Three-nothing. It's my serve!
- You're a cheater! I hate you!

392
00:33:25,358 --> 00:33:28,486
I'm gonna tell everybody
you were stealing fruit!

393
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:52,109
- You wanna take this book out?
- What?

394
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:55,253
You...

395
00:33:58,157 --> 00:34:02,787
Oh, I'm sorry, there's a hold
on this book of Gauguin...

396
00:34:02,996 --> 00:34:05,328
- What?
- There's...

397
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,032
Somebody called us and asked us
to hold this book for them.

398
00:34:12,238 --> 00:34:14,570
You put your name and address
on this card,

399
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:17,743
and when the book is free,
I'll send you a notice.

400
00:34:18,244 --> 00:34:20,337
- What?
- Quiet!

401
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:24,849
- I'll send you a notice!
- Any problem?

402
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:26,712
What?

403
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,644
No.

404
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:31,790
You're going on a vacation
tomorrow, aren't you?

405
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:34,721
- Yes.
- Well, you need it.

406
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:40,890
Natasha, Natasha, watch the desk
a second, will you? I'll be right back.

407
00:34:45,938 --> 00:34:49,738
- Listen, you want this book?
- I haven't done anything wrong.

408
00:34:49,942 --> 00:34:52,934
I haven't written in a book or nothing.
You could search me.

409
00:34:53,146 --> 00:34:56,445
I know you haven't done anything
wrong. Come on down here.

410
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:07,086
Come here.

411
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:10,323
Now if you like the book so much,
why not take it home.

412
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,862
- Do you have a library card?
- No, sir.

413
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:16,433
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- No, no.

414
00:35:17,236 --> 00:35:19,898
We give you a library card
so you can take books home.

415
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:22,074
You wouldn't have to come
every day.

416
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:24,709
You could take the book
right home with you.

417
00:35:24,911 --> 00:35:26,572
Why don't you want me
around here?

418
00:35:27,246 --> 00:35:30,909
- I didn't say I didn't want you here.
- I like it here.

419
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:34,449
I know, but the trouble is, someday,

420
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:37,885
somebody's gonna wanna take
this book out of here sometime.

421
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:39,752
Aren't you worried about that?

422
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:42,894
Why should I be worried?
Nobody done it yet.

423
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:48,662
And he comes in every day
in the morning.

424
00:35:48,868 --> 00:35:51,894
Every day, and he always takes out
the same book.

425
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:57,042
And he just sits there in the corner on
the floor looking at the same pictures.

426
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:01,272
- I'm absolutely stuffed.
- You eat like a bird.

427
00:36:02,782 --> 00:36:06,149
- Neil, what does your father do?
- For a living?

428
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:09,521
- My mother was wondering.
- He's a cat burglar.

429
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:12,680
- Seriously.
- Really, he's a cat burglar.

430
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:15,019
I don't know.
Tell her anything you want.

431
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:17,594
A merchant.
Tell her my father runs a store.

432
00:36:17,797 --> 00:36:19,890
Why don't you live
with your parents in Arizona?

433
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,863
Because I'm supposed to be grown up,
and I can't pick up

434
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:25,333
and follow my parents
wherever they go.

435
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:27,904
Then why do you stay
with your aunt and uncle?

436
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:31,338
Do I really have to explain
to your mother why I live where I do?

437
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:34,741
It's not just my mother.
I wanted to know too.

438
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:37,410
Are you cold?

439
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,280
- No.
- Do you wanna go home?

440
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:42,283
Not unless you do.

441
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:45,152
Neil, what about the library?

442
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:47,383
Who wants to know about that?

443
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:50,025
- My father.
- And you?

444
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:51,890
And me.

445
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:57,327
I don't know. What about the library?
It's not my life's work,

446
00:36:57,537 --> 00:36:59,835
but it's OK for now.

447
00:37:00,506 --> 00:37:02,269
I sold shoes once.

448
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:07,209
When I got out of the Army I worked in
my Uncle Aaron's real-estate company

449
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:09,040
for a couple of months.

450
00:37:11,951 --> 00:37:16,786
I liked the Army better than both of
those, and I like the library better too.

451
00:37:17,356 --> 00:37:18,721
Answer your question?

452
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:21,359
I don't see why
it should make you angry.

453
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:23,954
I'm not angry.

454
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:26,392
How can I make you understand?

455
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,965
You wanna know what my plans are
for the future.

456
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:31,033
I'm not planning anything.

457
00:37:31,237 --> 00:37:34,570
Besides, I'm not a planner.
I'm a liver.

458
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:36,867
I'm a pancreas.

459
00:38:32,798 --> 00:38:37,462
<i>The leaves have begun to turn</i>
<i>and redden on the trees.</i>

460
00:38:37,803 --> 00:38:40,795
<i>Smoking fires line fraternity row...</i>

461
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:43,771
That's just Ron
playing his Columbus record.

462
00:38:43,976 --> 00:38:45,307
No kidding.

463
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:21,239
<i>... has the loveliest girls in the country</i>
<i>because of the industry out there.</i>

464
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:24,039
<i>I'll drink to that. And...</i>

465
00:39:29,622 --> 00:39:31,920
Will you be happy if you break it?

466
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:34,752
Will you stop worrying
for two minutes?

467
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,264
Where is she at 1:00?

468
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:41,365
What do you want from her?

469
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:45,763
She's a college girl now, big girl.
She's not a baby anymore.

470
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:51,775
She only does it to aggravate me. She
meets a lot of boys from a nice family.

471
00:39:51,978 --> 00:39:54,378
Would it kill her to bring one
home for a change?

472
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,810
How do you know
he's not from a nice family?

473
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,944
Why do you always stick up for her?
Whatever I say is wrong.

474
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:04,213
- She's always right.
- What did I say? All I said was,

475
00:40:04,423 --> 00:40:08,792
- how do you know that he's not?
- Her against me. You always do that.

476
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:12,826
All right. Let her ruin her life.

477
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:16,563
Who cares what she winds up with?
It won't be on my conscience.

478
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:20,603
I'd like to know what you're starting up.
What are you starting up again for?

479
00:40:20,806 --> 00:40:23,274
What do you want from her?
I tell you, keep it up,

480
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:27,037
she'll end up marrying a ditchdigger
for spite! You hear?

481
00:40:28,814 --> 00:40:31,078
Turn off the set.

482
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:36,319
Will you turn off the set, please?

483
00:40:46,165 --> 00:40:47,598
Good night.

484
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:50,829
Good night.

485
00:40:55,307 --> 00:40:57,798
- Don't, Neil.
- Why not?

486
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:01,276
I could fall in love with you.
I don't want to.

487
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,004
Why?

488
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:07,318
- Don't I want to?
- Why could you fall in love with me?

489
00:41:09,055 --> 00:41:13,822
- Well, I like the way you look.
- Is that all?

490
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:20,523
- I like your body.
- I like your mind.

491
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:22,792
- You don't like my body?
- No, no.

492
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:25,095
Then it's denied you.

493
00:41:33,746 --> 00:41:36,544
- I don't want to make love now.
- Why?

494
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,777
I don't know. I just don't feel like it.

495
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:44,112
Never?

496
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:48,549
No.

497
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:51,556
I just don't feel like it now.

498
00:41:52,498 --> 00:41:54,056
When?

499
00:41:55,735 --> 00:41:57,794
The next time I feel like it.

500
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:04,574
- Brenda. Brenda.
- What?

501
00:42:04,777 --> 00:42:07,371
Brenda, could I see you
for just a second, please?

502
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:10,880
Could I see you?
Come here, come here.

503
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:14,052
- Please come over here for a second.
- What's the matter?

504
00:42:14,253 --> 00:42:16,551
Could you come over
to the car for a second?

505
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:19,054
- You come here.
- I can't.

506
00:42:21,927 --> 00:42:23,895
Will you call me
when you get home?

507
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,496
- After my cold shower or just before?
- What?

508
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:32,102
Come here. Come over here.

509
00:42:32,304 --> 00:42:34,602
It's not listed.
It's my private phone number.

510
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:36,138
Oh, Brenda.

511
00:42:37,543 --> 00:42:40,910
- It's 242-9970.
- Brenda!

512
00:43:59,525 --> 00:44:02,619
- Neil?
- <i>Brenda, are you in bed?</i>

513
00:44:03,229 --> 00:44:05,925
- Yes. Are you?
- <i>Yes.</i>

514
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:08,957
I'm in bed with you.

515
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:10,734
And I'm in bed with you.

516
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:15,639
You know, I have the shades drawn,
so it's very dark and I can't see you.

517
00:44:16,008 --> 00:44:18,033
<i>I can't see you either.</i>

518
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:21,941
That was so nice, kissing you, Neil.

519
00:44:22,414 --> 00:44:24,382
<i>I'm still kissing you.</i>

520
00:44:26,118 --> 00:44:28,018
Will you go to sleep kissing me?

521
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,388
I won't go to sleep at all.

522
00:44:30,589 --> 00:44:32,352
Don't say goodbye.

523
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:34,549
<i>I won't.</i>

524
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:36,622
I love you, Neil.

525
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:52,176
What's he doing?
He's in the closet making a phone call.

526
00:44:52,378 --> 00:44:54,312
That's what he's doing.

527
00:45:06,258 --> 00:45:08,749
You really mind taking me
to this party, don't you?

528
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:10,189
A little.

529
00:45:10,396 --> 00:45:12,796
I just thought you might like
to meet my friends.

530
00:45:12,998 --> 00:45:14,226
Why?

531
00:45:17,736 --> 00:45:20,204
- Great, fantastic!
- Thank you, Josh.

532
00:45:20,406 --> 00:45:22,931
Do you know that I've read
every book?

533
00:45:26,545 --> 00:45:30,572
- Scotch and water, please.
...since we got married.

534
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:38,586
Phi Ep, right?

535
00:45:38,891 --> 00:45:41,587
What? Give me that drink, will you?

536
00:45:43,228 --> 00:45:46,095
- ZBT.
- No.

537
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:57,475
- Sammy!
- No!

538
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,580
- Dartmouth, right?
- No, no, no!

539
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:08,953
I don't want to go.
I'm having a wonderful time.

540
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:10,849
We can leave any time you want to.

541
00:46:11,056 --> 00:46:13,251
I don't wanna leave.
I don't wanna leave.

542
00:46:16,628 --> 00:46:20,826
- Hey, hey. Hey! Excuse me. Phi Ep.
- Neil...

543
00:46:21,033 --> 00:46:24,298
Wait a minute. This is very important.
I'll get it. Sammy.

544
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:26,937
- No.
- Just a second, just a second.

545
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:28,936
- Dartmouth!
- That's right.

546
00:46:29,141 --> 00:46:32,304
How are you? You know who's here?
You'll never guess who...

547
00:46:32,511 --> 00:46:35,571
In a million years, who's here.
Come here! Hey! Just a moment.

548
00:46:35,781 --> 00:46:38,409
- This is very important.
- He's here. Dartmouth!

549
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:39,845
- Yeah?
- Dartmouth!

550
00:46:40,052 --> 00:46:42,987
- Dartmouth!
- Hey! How are you?

551
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,047
- '66.
- '64!

552
00:46:45,357 --> 00:46:47,951
What's the matter?
I'm having a wonderful time.

553
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,890
I don't wanna leave.
I came to make ten new friends.

554
00:46:51,096 --> 00:46:53,656
Now, I've only made seven so far.

555
00:46:55,534 --> 00:46:56,967
I'll introduce you.

556
00:46:57,169 --> 00:46:59,330
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hello, Don.

557
00:46:59,538 --> 00:47:02,564
- All right, who was that?
- Don Farber.

558
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:06,211
The boy I was engaged to.
He plays basketball with Ron.

559
00:47:07,446 --> 00:47:09,914
One of the fabulous Farber brothers!

560
00:47:10,115 --> 00:47:13,084
I didn't recognize him without his
little shorts and shoes

561
00:47:13,285 --> 00:47:15,480
and those other four guys
that are always...

562
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:18,114
My mother and father adore him.

563
00:47:18,323 --> 00:47:21,315
Well, that's reason enough
right there to break up with him.

564
00:47:21,527 --> 00:47:22,994
Yeah, it was.

565
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,966
How about the fellow in the blue
blazer? Were you engaged to him too?

566
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:29,828
My boyfriend in the tenth grade.

567
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:33,266
- Really? The guy in white pants?
- My boyfriend in 11th grade.

568
00:47:33,472 --> 00:47:36,600
- Didn't you go to summer school?
- Don't you have old girlfriends?

569
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:38,572
No, chew them up,
throw them away.

570
00:47:38,777 --> 00:47:40,005
I keep mine.

571
00:47:40,212 --> 00:47:42,305
Like a collection,
preserved and mummified.

572
00:47:42,514 --> 00:47:45,381
- Thank you very much.
- What, are you mad?

573
00:47:46,618 --> 00:47:49,610
- What is it, are you mad?
- What do you think?

574
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:52,687
They sound
like my father's generation.

575
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:55,724
Listen, you should be doing
half as well as most of them.

576
00:47:55,928 --> 00:47:57,657
In what way? Making money?

577
00:47:57,863 --> 00:48:00,331
That is nothing to be ashamed of.

578
00:48:00,532 --> 00:48:03,296
It really kills you, doesn't it?
The kind of job I have?

579
00:48:03,502 --> 00:48:07,302
You expect me to say I'm proud of it,
I want you to spend your life there?

580
00:48:07,506 --> 00:48:09,838
- People do, you know.
- That's just fine

581
00:48:10,042 --> 00:48:12,704
- if that's what you want.
- I don't know what I want.

582
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:15,641
I know what I don't wanna do.
Spend the rest of my life

583
00:48:15,848 --> 00:48:18,146
grubbing for money
as if nothing else existed.

584
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,874
Like who?

585
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,117
Like my friends?
Are you implying that? Or my family?

586
00:48:23,322 --> 00:48:26,052
Yeah, your family.
Your family and your friends.

587
00:48:26,258 --> 00:48:28,590
What would you like to do?
Sleep in the park?

588
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:30,591
I don't know. Part of me.

589
00:48:30,796 --> 00:48:32,559
Then just do it! Do something.

590
00:48:32,764 --> 00:48:36,029
Don't just stand there and look down
your nose at everything.

591
00:48:37,202 --> 00:48:39,170
Don't you think I know that?

592
00:48:39,505 --> 00:48:43,464
I can't go all the way on either side.
They both seem so ridiculous to me.

593
00:48:43,675 --> 00:48:45,404
Everything does.

594
00:48:47,246 --> 00:48:49,646
I can't take anything seriously.

595
00:49:01,193 --> 00:49:02,421
Make love to me.

596
00:49:06,131 --> 00:49:08,861
You do love me, don't you?
I'll let you make love to me

597
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:11,331
whether you do or not,
so tell me the truth.

598
00:49:11,537 --> 00:49:13,266
- Stay away from me, please.
- What?

599
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:15,497
Just stay away from me, OK?

600
00:49:17,409 --> 00:49:19,434
I don't understand.

601
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:22,805
I don't understand.

602
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:25,413
- You do, don't you?
- What?

603
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:27,585
- Love me.
- No.

604
00:49:28,086 --> 00:49:29,951
I want you to.

605
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:34,419
What about the kind of job I have?
No plans for the future, you know.

606
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:38,725
If you love me,
there won't be anything to worry about.

607
00:49:39,898 --> 00:49:43,231
Well, then, of course I love you.

608
00:49:56,682 --> 00:49:58,980
Let's take off all our clothes
and go swimming.

609
00:49:59,184 --> 00:50:01,846
Are you crazy?
There's 100 people up there.

610
00:50:02,054 --> 00:50:03,612
But that's what makes it fun.

611
00:50:03,822 --> 00:50:07,724
Listen, you go in first,
and I'll close my eyes and wait for you.

612
00:50:07,926 --> 00:50:11,054
And then when you come back,
you'll surprise me with the cold.

613
00:50:11,263 --> 00:50:13,094
You really like games, don't you?

614
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:16,696
- Go ahead, I'll close my eyes.
- You go in.

615
00:50:17,736 --> 00:50:20,204
- Will you close your eyes?
- No.

616
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:24,869
- Let's both go in. OK?
- I'd rather kiss you.

617
00:50:25,077 --> 00:50:29,207
- No, I want to go swimming first.
- Go ahead. Go on, go on, go on.

618
00:51:55,434 --> 00:51:57,595
- Ron's getting married!
- When?

619
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:01,603
Labor Day! He's marrying Harriette!
I'm gonna be a sister-in-law!

620
00:52:01,807 --> 00:52:04,207
- You are?
- Hi. I'm gonna be a sister-in-law.

621
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:06,468
Yes, I heard that.
When did that happen?

622
00:52:06,678 --> 00:52:08,373
This afternoon.

623
00:52:08,613 --> 00:52:10,706
They talked long-distance
for half an hour,

624
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:14,215
and Harriette's gonna fly in next week
for an enormous wedding.

625
00:52:14,419 --> 00:52:17,252
My parents are going crazy.
They've got to order flowers,

626
00:52:17,456 --> 00:52:20,448
write out invitations and all that
and no time to do it.

627
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:22,286
The whole family is in an uproar.

628
00:52:22,494 --> 00:52:24,928
Oh, and my father's
taking Ron into the business.

629
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:29,226
He's starting him at $200 a week, and
then he'll work his way up from there,

630
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:31,334
which will take him until October.

631
00:52:31,536 --> 00:52:33,504
I thought he was gonna be
a gym teacher.

632
00:52:33,705 --> 00:52:36,538
Not now. He has responsibilities.

633
00:52:37,476 --> 00:52:39,910
Come on upstairs.
I'll take you to your room.

634
00:52:45,984 --> 00:52:48,179
- I'd rather take you to your room.
- Maybe.

635
00:52:48,387 --> 00:52:51,686
All night? Get up early and go back
to my room. Set the alarm.

636
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,188
- And wake up everybody?
- I'll wake myself up.

637
00:52:54,393 --> 00:52:56,691
I can do that easy when I have to.

638
00:52:56,995 --> 00:52:59,589
- Front. Front, please.
- Come on.

639
00:53:06,405 --> 00:53:10,501
Oh, yes. This is very nice.
I like your room better. Where is it?

640
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:12,973
It's at the other end of the hall.

641
00:53:14,146 --> 00:53:15,738
Later.

642
00:53:15,947 --> 00:53:18,142
What happens if I can't wait?

643
00:53:19,184 --> 00:53:20,879
Start without me!

644
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,185
Aunt Gladys,

645
00:54:00,592 --> 00:54:02,184
leave me alone.

646
00:54:04,729 --> 00:54:07,630
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

647
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:09,600
Hey, congratulations.

648
00:54:10,635 --> 00:54:11,966
Thanks.

649
00:54:13,605 --> 00:54:15,334
Been wanting to talk with you.

650
00:54:46,538 --> 00:54:50,269
- Well, this is really something, huh?
- Yeah.

651
00:54:52,244 --> 00:54:55,111
- Getting married.
- Yeah.

652
00:54:57,616 --> 00:55:00,210
- So how does it feel?
- Better, thanks.

653
00:55:00,418 --> 00:55:03,717
Farber smacked it under the boards,
but I'll be able to play

654
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:05,913
in the next game. Thanks.

655
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:08,525
No.

656
00:55:09,794 --> 00:55:12,957
- No, I meant getting married.
- Oh.

657
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:15,155
OK, I guess.

658
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:18,200
I don't really know.
I'm not married yet.

659
00:55:23,909 --> 00:55:25,638
Hey, you know anything
about music?

660
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:27,311
Yes, a little.

661
00:55:27,512 --> 00:55:30,447
You know I got all the Andre
Kostelanetz records ever made?

662
00:55:30,649 --> 00:55:32,913
You like Mantovani?
I got all of him too.

663
00:55:33,118 --> 00:55:35,985
I think semiclassicals
are really great.

664
00:55:36,888 --> 00:55:40,517
And you can listen to my
Columbus record any time you'd like.

665
00:55:43,495 --> 00:55:44,962
Great.

666
00:55:55,907 --> 00:56:00,867
Company! At a time like this!
That's just what I need!

667
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:05,106
- For two weeks yet!
- I asked you, Mother.

668
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,840
You asked your father.

669
00:56:07,052 --> 00:56:10,544
You should ask me. He doesn't
know what extra work this is for me.

670
00:56:10,755 --> 00:56:13,019
You'd think we didn't have
Carlotta and Jenny!

671
00:56:13,224 --> 00:56:15,920
Carlotta and Jenny
cannot do everything.

672
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,858
- This is not the Salvation Army!
- What the hell does that mean?

673
00:56:20,065 --> 00:56:22,499
You watch your tongue, young lady.

674
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:26,193
That may be very well for your
college friends, but not in this house!

675
00:56:26,404 --> 00:56:29,464
- Will you stop that!
- Don't you raise your voice to me.

676
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:32,904
When was the last time you helped
around here?

677
00:56:33,111 --> 00:56:35,671
I'm not a slave, I'm a daughter.

678
00:56:36,014 --> 00:56:39,347
You ought to learn
what it means to earn a living.

679
00:56:39,551 --> 00:56:41,018
- Why?
- Why?

680
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:42,686
Do you really wanna know why?

681
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:45,355
Because all you think about
is how pretty you are.

682
00:56:45,557 --> 00:56:48,890
Well, you are gonna find out the world
doesn't owe you a living!

683
00:56:49,094 --> 00:56:50,755
What is that supposed to mean?

684
00:56:50,962 --> 00:56:54,591
It means you should find out how to
earn money and buy your own clothes.

685
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,034
My father earns all the money
he needs.

686
00:56:57,235 --> 00:56:59,863
- Oh, yes.
- What are you complaining about?

687
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:02,539
When was the last time
you washed the dishes?

688
00:57:02,741 --> 00:57:05,437
My God!
Carlotta washes the dishes!

689
00:57:05,644 --> 00:57:07,441
Don't you "my God" me!

690
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:10,076
Oh, Mother,
why the hell are you like this?

691
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:14,615
You bring a boy in this house, a
strange boy... Are you listening to me?

692
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,683
For two weeks, without even
bothering to ask me. A strange boy.

693
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,983
Don't you run away
when I'm talking to you!

694
00:57:21,192 --> 00:57:23,786
Brenda is crying!

695
00:57:23,995 --> 00:57:26,395
- You'll get yours, you little bastard!
- Brenda!

696
00:57:26,598 --> 00:57:29,829
Mama! Brenda cursed!
Brenda cursed at me!

697
00:57:30,669 --> 00:57:32,933
Are we going
to the Hellmans' or not?

698
00:57:35,573 --> 00:57:38,542
Come on, hush, hush. Let's go. Hush.

699
00:57:38,877 --> 00:57:40,344
Goddamn her.

700
00:57:40,545 --> 00:57:41,773
Maybe I should go.

701
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,882
- They're going visiting, thank God.
- Brenda. Brenda, look at me.

702
00:57:46,084 --> 00:57:49,110
- I hope they never come back.
- Brenda. Brenda!

703
00:57:49,454 --> 00:57:51,854
- Ron is still in his room.
- His door is closed.

704
00:57:52,057 --> 00:57:54,855
You can't hear anybody walk here,
because they all creep

705
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,721
in their sneakers.

706
00:57:58,596 --> 00:58:00,962
It's Ron, really, getting married.
And me.

707
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:03,896
With Harriette a family member,
they'll forget I exist!

708
00:58:04,102 --> 00:58:07,469
That's OK with you. What is this?
What is this? What's in here?

709
00:58:07,672 --> 00:58:08,900
Money!

710
00:58:12,077 --> 00:58:13,567
What is this?

711
00:58:14,512 --> 00:58:17,310
- Our old furniture.
- Yeah? How old?

712
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:19,816
From when we were poor.

713
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:25,385
Come on. Come on, will you? You're
getting filthy. Let's get out of here.

714
00:58:29,461 --> 00:58:31,486
- It's not here.
- What?

715
00:58:31,996 --> 00:58:35,693
- I told you, the money.
- You didn't tell me. What money?

716
00:58:39,137 --> 00:58:40,798
What money?

717
00:58:42,707 --> 00:58:47,542
When I was little and we just moved
here, my father brought me up here.

718
00:58:47,779 --> 00:58:51,681
Brought me into this room one day,
and he said that...

719
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:55,616
...if anything ever happened to him,

720
00:58:56,287 --> 00:58:59,552
he wanted me to know where there
was money that I should have.

721
00:58:59,758 --> 00:59:02,625
He said it was for me
and not for anybody else.

722
00:59:03,628 --> 00:59:05,926
That I should never tell
anybody about it.

723
00:59:06,564 --> 00:59:09,158
Not even Ron or my mother.

724
00:59:11,436 --> 00:59:12,664
How much was it?

725
00:59:13,638 --> 00:59:16,232
It was three 100 dollar bills.

726
00:59:17,742 --> 00:59:20,040
I'd never even seen one before.

727
00:59:21,412 --> 00:59:23,710
Well, where is it?
Maybe somebody stole it.

728
00:59:23,915 --> 00:59:27,407
I don't know! I didn't even know
it was missing until just now.

729
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:30,020
I guess he took it away.

730
00:59:32,857 --> 00:59:35,121
I always had everything,
so I didn't need it.

731
00:59:35,326 --> 00:59:38,659
I guess he knew I didn't need it
and just took it away.

732
00:59:42,734 --> 00:59:44,531
Why did you want it now?

733
00:59:45,003 --> 00:59:46,732
I don't know.

734
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:54,709
I wanted to find it and rip it into 1,000
pieces and stuff them in her purse.

735
00:59:54,913 --> 00:59:58,474
And if it would've been there,
I swear that's what I would've done!

736
01:00:00,118 --> 01:00:01,881
I wouldn't let you.

737
01:00:42,961 --> 01:00:45,395
Make love to me.

738
01:00:45,697 --> 01:00:48,029
- What?
- Make love to me.

739
01:01:01,112 --> 01:01:05,208
Watch me.
The bird man dies tonight.

740
01:01:06,084 --> 01:01:08,314
Salad, Ronald.

741
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,181
Mother.

742
01:01:11,723 --> 01:01:14,351
Can I have the gravy too, please?

743
01:01:14,626 --> 01:01:18,118
- Salt.
- Can I have the cabbage, Daddy?

744
01:01:19,964 --> 01:01:23,730
- You're gonna get fat.
- Am not.

745
01:01:27,572 --> 01:01:29,233
No. No more for me, thank you.

746
01:01:29,741 --> 01:01:32,574
He eats like a bird. What do you want?

747
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:20,317
<i>But the season was up and down.</i>

748
01:03:20,518 --> 01:03:22,986
<i>By the time the first snow</i>
<i>had covered the turf,</i>

749
01:03:23,187 --> 01:03:25,917
<i>there was dribbling</i>
<i>and the cry, "Up and in."</i>

750
01:03:26,124 --> 01:03:28,592
Well, good night, Brenda.

751
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,990
- Good night, Neil.
- See you in the morning.

752
01:03:32,196 --> 01:03:34,858
<i>Now we're ready</i>
<i>for the Minnesota game...</i>

753
01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:38,194
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

754
01:03:38,403 --> 01:03:40,963
<i>There'll be a hand of appreciation</i>
<i>from the crowd...</i>

755
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:44,471
- Well, I had my first day at work today.
- Oh? How was it?

756
01:03:44,675 --> 01:03:46,575
OK, I guess. I was a little...

757
01:03:46,778 --> 01:03:50,544
<i>And here comes Ron Patimkin</i>
<i>dribbling out.</i>

758
01:03:52,116 --> 01:03:54,880
<i>Ron, number 11,</i>
<i>from Purchase, New York.</i>

759
01:03:55,086 --> 01:03:57,281
<i>What a great season he's had.</i>

760
01:03:57,488 --> 01:03:59,922
<i>For big Ron, it's his last game,</i>

761
01:04:00,124 --> 01:04:04,493
<i>and it'll be some time</i>
<i>before Buckeye fans forget him.</i>

762
01:04:05,496 --> 01:04:08,522
- <i>Number seven.</i>
- <i>Here comes Larry Gardner.</i>

763
01:04:08,733 --> 01:04:10,564
<i>Big number seven out onto the floor.</i>

764
01:04:10,768 --> 01:04:13,794
Would you like to come to my room
and listen to records?

765
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:18,237
Not right now, Ron. I'm a little tired.
Thank you, though.

766
01:04:18,443 --> 01:04:23,142
Your mother's trying to sleep. It's a
workday tomorrow. Go to bed already.

767
01:04:25,016 --> 01:04:27,484
Who do you like better,
Mantovani or Kostelanetz?

768
01:04:27,685 --> 01:04:29,619
I don't know. I like them both.

769
01:04:29,821 --> 01:04:32,119
Me too. That's all I play.

770
01:04:36,794 --> 01:04:40,696
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

771
01:04:52,376 --> 01:04:56,642
<i>We offer ourselves to you, then,</i>
<i>world, and come at you...</i>

772
01:04:56,848 --> 01:05:01,308
<i>... did the television series</i>
<i>many years ago, I think around 1950,</i>

773
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:04,454
- <i>before he was known at all.</i>
- <i>Thank you and goodbye.</i>

774
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:08,284
<i>We will miss you in the fall,</i>
<i>in the winter, in the spring,</i>

775
01:05:08,493 --> 01:05:10,586
<i>but someday, we shall return.</i>

776
01:05:10,795 --> 01:05:15,425
<i>Till then, goodbye, Ohio State.</i>
<i>Goodbye, red and white.</i>

777
01:05:15,633 --> 01:05:22,232
<i>Goodbye, Columbus.</i>
<i>Goodbye, Columbus, goodbye.</i>

778
01:05:28,179 --> 01:05:30,511
What are you thinking?

779
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:33,714
I don't know.

780
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,745
About me?

781
01:05:39,357 --> 01:05:40,756
No.

782
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:42,858
- Your father.
- What about him?

783
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,153
I like him.

784
01:05:46,297 --> 01:05:49,994
Has he asked you yet
if you wanna go into business?

785
01:05:50,635 --> 01:05:53,433
Why? Did he say something
to you about it?

786
01:05:53,638 --> 01:05:58,234
No, but he will.
Every single boy I go out with.

787
01:05:58,843 --> 01:06:02,279
Nice to be in such
a nonexclusive club.

788
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:05,380
Listen, he means well.

789
01:06:06,617 --> 01:06:08,812
We don't have time.

790
01:06:17,762 --> 01:06:22,096
Oh, hey, say. Now, listen,
where'd you get the funny knuckles?

791
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,498
- What's funny about my knuckles?
- I know a doctor who could fix them.

792
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:52,161
- Morning, Mr. Patimkin.
- Good morning.

793
01:06:54,165 --> 01:06:57,396
No, I cannot!
I've only got a million things to do.

794
01:06:57,602 --> 01:07:00,162
The man from the liquor store
hasn't answered back.

795
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:02,737
I have to get down to the florist
sometime today

796
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:06,034
to make a decision
about the centerpieces.

797
01:07:06,244 --> 01:07:07,506
How can I ask Brenda?

798
01:07:07,712 --> 01:07:10,408
She went to New York
to buy a dress for the wedding.

799
01:07:10,615 --> 01:07:13,641
Wait a minute, I'll ask Neil.
Neil, Brenda's friend.

800
01:07:13,851 --> 01:07:17,651
Neil!
I'll call you back later.

801
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:20,446
Neil, darling.

802
01:07:21,726 --> 01:07:24,286
Could I ask you to do me a favor?

803
01:07:24,495 --> 01:07:29,558
<i>Mr. Patimkin has some</i>
<i>silver patterns he wants me to look at.</i>

804
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:34,363
<i>Would you drive down to the store</i>
<i>and pick them up for me?</i>

805
01:07:39,076 --> 01:07:41,806
Let's get the truck loaded.
You get paid by the hour,

806
01:07:42,013 --> 01:07:45,676
so let's get them in the truck already.
Come on!

807
01:07:52,723 --> 01:07:54,623
- Hey.
- Ron, how are you?

808
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:57,726
- Where's your father?
- He's right inside.

809
01:08:00,264 --> 01:08:04,462
All right, let's keep working. Get those
things loaded. We don't have all day.

810
01:08:04,669 --> 01:08:06,967
What are you talking about?
I got them... Wait.

811
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:09,002
In a minute, I'll have them.

812
01:08:09,206 --> 01:08:13,870
No. There it is.
Yeah, the ledgeback, number 945.

813
01:08:14,078 --> 01:08:17,377
What do you mean, they don't
make it? I had six last week!

814
01:08:17,581 --> 01:08:22,018
Grossman, I'm telling you I had them,
and I know they're still making them.

815
01:08:22,553 --> 01:08:24,043
Yeah. Sit.

816
01:08:24,255 --> 01:08:25,722
Yeah.

817
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:29,457
Tomorrow?
What do you mean, tomorrow?

818
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:34,757
Don't give me that tomorrow business.
The world could blow up tomorrow.

819
01:08:35,166 --> 01:08:37,498
Grossman, you listen to me.

820
01:08:38,602 --> 01:08:40,035
Crap!

821
01:08:40,237 --> 01:08:43,638
You're not the only one in town,
my good friend.

822
01:08:44,108 --> 01:08:46,576
Yeah. That's more like it.

823
01:08:46,777 --> 01:08:50,474
Fine.
Yeah, we'll be here till 5, no later.

824
01:08:50,681 --> 01:08:54,310
My kid will be here. Yeah, I brought
him into the business with me.

825
01:08:54,518 --> 01:08:57,453
All right, Marty. Bye-bye.

826
01:08:58,289 --> 01:09:00,655
- Hey, Dad.
- Did you send them out to lunch?

827
01:09:00,858 --> 01:09:03,053
I thought I'd send some now
and some later.

828
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,751
- Why?
- That way, somebody's always here.

829
01:09:05,963 --> 01:09:09,194
No fancy deals here.
We all go out to lunch the same time.

830
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,197
All right.

831
01:09:12,103 --> 01:09:14,196
College kids.

832
01:09:14,405 --> 01:09:16,703
Four years in college,
he can't load a truck.

833
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:21,310
Well, they don't teach too much about
truck loading anymore in college.

834
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,446
And what do they teach in college?
About books?

835
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:28,584
A lot you can learn from books.

836
01:09:28,786 --> 01:09:33,086
Let me tell you something. In the real
world, you need a little <i>gonif</i> in you.

837
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,986
- You know what that means, <i>gonif?</i>
- Thief.

838
01:09:39,163 --> 01:09:41,358
You think I'm a schmuck, don't you?

839
01:09:44,301 --> 01:09:47,464
- No, I don't think so.
- Thank you.

840
01:09:47,671 --> 01:09:50,139
You kids.
The way you look at us

841
01:09:50,341 --> 01:09:52,741
while we bat our brains out
making a living.

842
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:55,537
Like we're freaks
and you're something special.

843
01:09:55,746 --> 01:09:59,580
Let me tell you something. When I
was your age, I felt exactly like you do.

844
01:09:59,784 --> 01:10:01,775
Surprise you?

845
01:10:04,655 --> 01:10:06,850
Yeah. Grossman.

846
01:10:07,057 --> 01:10:11,426
Five o'clock today, the deal's off.
That's right, by 5 or forget it.

847
01:10:35,586 --> 01:10:37,713
Is this where you're sleeping?

848
01:10:39,223 --> 01:10:42,818
- What are you doing?
- Contacts.

849
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:51,832
Is everything in its place now?

850
01:11:00,978 --> 01:11:03,606
I can't believe a week
could go by so fast.

851
01:11:03,814 --> 01:11:06,305
Let's slow the next one down.

852
01:11:07,585 --> 01:11:09,416
We don't have time.

853
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:13,249
Listen, the whole house
is gonna be up in five minutes.

854
01:11:13,824 --> 01:11:16,418
I'll only take four.

855
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:29,600
Oh, unfair. Unfair.

856
01:11:32,943 --> 01:11:37,312
Neil? I spoke to my father last night
about you coming to the wedding.

857
01:11:37,515 --> 01:11:40,507
I thought we wouldn't talk about
the wedding. You promised.

858
01:11:40,718 --> 01:11:41,946
But I want you there.

859
01:11:42,152 --> 01:11:45,315
- I know. She doesn't, your mother.
- She'll be so hysterical

860
01:11:45,523 --> 01:11:49,084
- that she won't know who's there.
- I don't want to talk about it.

861
01:11:49,293 --> 01:11:52,558
Oh, my God,
are you gonna start that again?

862
01:11:55,466 --> 01:11:58,867
Should I love that you go back
to school the day after the wedding?

863
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:03,005
- Don't bring it up every five minutes.
- Well, I can't help it. I dread it.

864
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:04,697
Me too.

865
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:06,934
You don't act like it.

866
01:12:07,144 --> 01:12:10,875
- What, would you like it in writing?
- Maybe.

867
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:13,208
Call my father's lawyer.

868
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:16,284
Why is it so peculiar
that I'd like some commitment?

869
01:12:16,487 --> 01:12:18,648
Some concrete assurance
it won't all be over

870
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:21,416
two days after you're back in school?

871
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:26,456
May I know your name?

872
01:12:27,298 --> 01:12:30,267
Well, you got the message.
Do you have the plan?

873
01:12:31,835 --> 01:12:34,599
I can't stand the slop in this joint.
We gotta bust out.

874
01:12:34,805 --> 01:12:37,603
Are you in my cellblock?

875
01:12:40,311 --> 01:12:43,144
- What kind of a commitment?
- I don't know.

876
01:12:43,347 --> 01:12:46,805
Some kind of sacrifice. You know,
something symbolic. A gesture.

877
01:12:47,017 --> 01:12:50,646
- How about if I sacrifice my sister?
- No. Too young.

878
01:12:50,854 --> 01:12:53,345
- You want my mother?
- No.

879
01:12:53,557 --> 01:12:55,252
- Too old.
- Only one thing left,

880
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:58,257
- it's my sister-in-law's virginity.
- Hey.

881
01:12:58,462 --> 01:13:02,865
- You think she and Ron ever did it?
- Harriette?

882
01:13:03,968 --> 01:13:05,196
Not a chance.

883
01:13:05,402 --> 01:13:08,530
Come on. You kidding?
With all those pills, everybody does it.

884
01:13:08,739 --> 01:13:11,333
Not Harriette, she'll never do it.
Much too dirty.

885
01:13:11,542 --> 01:13:13,840
Hey, I meant to ask you.
About those pills,

886
01:13:14,044 --> 01:13:16,410
don't you have to take them
in the morning?

887
01:13:16,614 --> 01:13:19,310
Does it make any difference
when you take it?

888
01:13:19,516 --> 01:13:21,609
I don't take them.

889
01:13:38,068 --> 01:13:42,767
- What did you say?
- Hard. Come on.

890
01:13:43,474 --> 01:13:45,169
Brenda.

891
01:13:45,376 --> 01:13:49,107
- Really hard.
- What do you take?

892
01:13:49,313 --> 01:13:53,147
- Nothing. Turn off the water.
- Nothing?

893
01:13:54,318 --> 01:13:57,116
Listen, I tried the pills,
but they made me fat, sick,

894
01:13:57,321 --> 01:14:00,984
and every day you read something
new about them in the paper.

895
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:04,285
So I decided
I was better off with nothing.

896
01:14:06,764 --> 01:14:11,201
Brenda, I'd like to talk to you
about nothing.

897
01:14:12,036 --> 01:14:14,197
You mean nothing?

898
01:14:19,109 --> 01:14:21,873
- Is that Julie getting up?
- You don't mean nothing.

899
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,412
- Hurry up, get out of here!
- That's all you're worried about?

900
01:14:25,616 --> 01:14:27,208
Someone's gonna find me in here?

901
01:14:27,418 --> 01:14:29,716
Can't you hear there's
somebody getting up?

902
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,412
How can a middle-class Jewish girl
go to bed every night with somebody

903
01:14:33,624 --> 01:14:35,285
and not use any precaution?

904
01:14:35,492 --> 01:14:37,585
Don't you know
they make babies that way?

905
01:14:37,795 --> 01:14:40,559
You think it's like what
you read about, see in movies?

906
01:14:40,764 --> 01:14:43,961
All you do is go to bed with
somebody once, and you have a baby?

907
01:14:44,168 --> 01:14:45,931
Yes, it's been known to happen.

908
01:14:46,136 --> 01:14:49,572
All right, all right, just tell me this.
Will you tell me this?

909
01:14:49,773 --> 01:14:53,265
Will you concede this much?
It's possible, right? To get pregnant.

910
01:14:53,477 --> 01:14:57,379
One time is all that's really necessary,
in theory, for you to get pregnant.

911
01:14:57,581 --> 01:14:59,310
- That's possible, isn't it?
- Yes.

912
01:14:59,516 --> 01:15:01,848
- With my luck, you're pregnant.
- You serious?

913
01:15:02,052 --> 01:15:04,520
I'm way the hell past serious,
I'm suicidal.

914
01:15:04,722 --> 01:15:06,917
Will you cut that out?
Are you so spoiled

915
01:15:07,124 --> 01:15:10,491
that you can't imagine
the possibility of... Don't shush me!

916
01:15:10,694 --> 01:15:14,391
You can't imagine the possibility of
something terrible happening to you?

917
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:15,598
- I don't want to discuss this anymore.
- OK.

918
01:15:15,798 --> 01:15:16,932
- I don't want to discuss this anymore.
- OK.

919
01:15:17,134 --> 01:15:20,535
You'll go to a doctor this afternoon,
and you'll get some pills.

920
01:15:20,738 --> 01:15:24,003
- I told you, they make me sick.
- All of them?

921
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:26,267
- Lots of them.
- OK, you keep trying.

922
01:15:26,477 --> 01:15:29,378
They make all different kinds,
a hundred different kinds.

923
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:31,944
I'm not taking the pills,
and that's the end.

924
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:33,844
And you don't just take the pills,

925
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:36,713
you have to start taking them
at a specific time.

926
01:15:38,822 --> 01:15:40,517
Get a diaphragm.

927
01:15:41,525 --> 01:15:43,618
Diaphragm?

928
01:15:44,094 --> 01:15:46,392
What if I won't?

929
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,501
Oh, go to hell.

930
01:17:05,309 --> 01:17:07,470
Did you get it?

931
01:17:08,946 --> 01:17:10,607
Where is it?

932
01:17:10,814 --> 01:17:14,545
- I'm wearing it.
- What?

933
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:21,281
Brenda Patimkin.
Brenda Patimkin, I love you, I love you.

934
01:17:24,494 --> 01:17:27,190
Come, my pussycat!

935
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:35,905
Now that you have spoken the words
and performed the rites

936
01:17:36,273 --> 01:17:40,471
which unite your lives, I do hereby,
in conformity with the faith of Israel

937
01:17:40,677 --> 01:17:42,406
and in the eyes of God

938
01:17:42,613 --> 01:17:45,639
and in accordance with the laws
of the state of New York,

939
01:17:45,849 --> 01:17:48,784
declare your marriage
to be valid and binding,

940
01:17:48,986 --> 01:17:52,615
and I pronounce you, Ronald,
and you, Harriette,

941
01:17:52,823 --> 01:17:57,419
to be husband and wife
before God and before all men.

942
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:41,396
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

943
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:58,151
- Congratulations to you.
- Thank you very much.

944
01:18:58,522 --> 01:19:00,456
And to you too, sweetie.

945
01:19:00,657 --> 01:19:02,716
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

946
01:19:02,926 --> 01:19:04,723
Oh, and lots of happiness to you.

947
01:19:04,928 --> 01:19:09,331
Well, they got... They did it, huh?
They got married. Big weddings.

948
01:19:10,734 --> 01:19:14,101
When I got married, who knew about
big weddings? You got married.

949
01:19:14,304 --> 01:19:17,205
I've gotta tell you. You look lovely.
Really, you do.

950
01:19:17,407 --> 01:19:21,537
Absolutely adored everything
and I love your son.

951
01:19:22,312 --> 01:19:26,373
- I can't stand that Ehrlich woman.
- Congratulations.

952
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:28,107
- Neil.
- Hi.

953
01:19:36,326 --> 01:19:40,023
Seymour, <i>mechaieh.</i> Today's gonna be
the classiest affair of the year.

954
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:42,221
Nothing but the best for our kids, huh?

955
01:19:42,432 --> 01:19:45,731
Ron was telling me
you have a very interesting job.

956
01:19:45,936 --> 01:19:48,871
- I work in the library.
- Wonderful!

957
01:19:49,072 --> 01:19:51,836
You must get first crack
at all the bestsellers.

958
01:19:55,579 --> 01:19:57,672
- Sometimes.
- I hope I'm not

959
01:19:57,881 --> 01:19:59,712
being too presumptuous
in saying this,

960
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:03,283
but Ron and I were hoping that you
and Brenda would double with us.

961
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:06,020
Well, it sounds nice.

962
01:20:11,328 --> 01:20:12,590
Excuse me.

963
01:21:04,681 --> 01:21:06,774
You're next!

964
01:21:07,918 --> 01:21:11,354
I only get <i>shikker</i> at weddings
and bar mitzvahs. Let's dance.

965
01:21:11,555 --> 01:21:13,887
- Later, OK?
- Later? All right.

966
01:21:14,091 --> 01:21:16,355
<i>Later, later, later</i>

967
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,154
Sonny, come on, take a picture.
Just Molly and me.

968
01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:21,023
- Why not?
- Just Molly and me.

969
01:21:21,231 --> 01:21:25,031
- Take a picture. Very nice, dear.
- Ready?

970
01:21:25,235 --> 01:21:27,567
- Ready.
- Smile.

971
01:21:27,771 --> 01:21:30,205
- Harry, what are you doing?
- "Harry..."

972
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:31,874
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

973
01:21:41,351 --> 01:21:45,219
Hi, you two lovebirds. You're next.

974
01:21:45,422 --> 01:21:49,290
By the way, sweetie, what have you
been doing with yourself this summer?

975
01:21:49,493 --> 01:21:51,927
Growing a penis.

976
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:01,296
- You having a good time?
- Oh, wonderful.

977
01:22:01,505 --> 01:22:02,733
Great.

978
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:21,385
I told them to live in the neighborhood.
Easy for us to visit them, vice versa.

979
01:22:21,591 --> 01:22:25,152
So they're gonna have a conference.
Everything today is a conference.

980
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:45,172
Are you <i>meshuga?</i>
It's way over 1,000 yards.

981
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,282
- Who's <i>meshuga?</i>
- Let's measure it.

982
01:22:47,484 --> 01:22:49,577
Let's measure it.

983
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:56,291
- What are they doing?
- That's Uncle Max and Uncle Manny.

984
01:22:56,493 --> 01:22:59,485
They're in the
carpet business together.

985
01:23:07,671 --> 01:23:09,571
Hello, Neil. How are you?

986
01:23:09,773 --> 01:23:12,640
- Mind if I dance with Brenda?
- No, if she wants to.

987
01:23:12,842 --> 01:23:15,572
- OK?
- Come on.

988
01:23:39,869 --> 01:23:43,635
So?
You're Brenda's boyfriend, huh?

989
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,907
You got a good deal there, boy,
if you don't louse it up.

990
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:50,170
- Thank you. She's very beautiful.
- Beautiful, not beautiful.

991
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:52,712
If you're Aly Khan
you worry about movie stars.

992
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:56,283
Me, I'm a practical man.
On the bottom, you gotta be.

993
01:24:08,498 --> 01:24:10,489
Know how old I was
before I got married?

994
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,930
Thirty-five years old,
and I still don't know

995
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:15,400
what the hell kind of a hurry I was in.

996
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,828
The son of a bitch who invented
the fluorescent bulb should drop dead.

997
01:25:15,031 --> 01:25:19,468
They never wear out, those things, you
know that? They could burn for years.

998
01:25:19,969 --> 01:25:22,437
- Leo!
- Ben!

999
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:25,641
Hey, you kids having a good time?

1000
01:25:25,842 --> 01:25:30,176
- It's a fine wedding, Mr. Patimkin.
- Thank you, thank you.

1001
01:25:30,413 --> 01:25:31,641
- So?
- What do you think

1002
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:34,908
- of your brother getting married?
- You like weddings, Daddy?

1003
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:37,552
I like my kids' weddings.

1004
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:42,055
I didn't even own an automobile.
His brother and I don't own a car.

1005
01:25:42,258 --> 01:25:44,192
I take the train wherever I go.

1006
01:25:44,627 --> 01:25:49,758
Anything in the whole world
that you want,

1007
01:25:49,966 --> 01:25:52,799
you know you can get them.

1008
01:25:59,008 --> 01:26:01,476
Because, Brenda...

1009
01:26:03,346 --> 01:26:05,871
...you've been a good girl.

1010
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:09,578
You get good marks in school...

1011
01:26:10,053 --> 01:26:11,816
...and...

1012
01:26:13,723 --> 01:26:18,319
...you've given me a lot of <i>naches.</i>
A lot of joy.

1013
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:22,564
All my children have.

1014
01:26:23,133 --> 01:26:26,899
And believe me, for a million dollars,

1015
01:26:27,103 --> 01:26:30,539
nobody in this world could buy that joy.

1016
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:33,709
No, no, no, no, no.

1017
01:26:34,711 --> 01:26:39,410
Listen, I'm not kidding myself.

1018
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:44,349
Ron is not the brainiest boy
in the whole world.

1019
01:26:45,588 --> 01:26:49,354
But he's a nice boy.
He really is a nice boy.

1020
01:26:49,559 --> 01:26:55,589
And believe me,
in these days, it's especially important.

1021
01:26:56,699 --> 01:26:59,429
Yeah, because you read in the papers,

1022
01:26:59,869 --> 01:27:05,808
all the boys have, today, the children.
Get in trouble.

1023
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:10,873
They don't have any sense of morals,
you know?

1024
01:27:11,748 --> 01:27:13,978
I'll tell you the truth.

1025
01:27:14,951 --> 01:27:18,284
I feel very sorry for their parents.

1026
01:27:18,621 --> 01:27:20,418
Because...

1027
01:27:21,658 --> 01:27:24,024
...I know how unhappy
your mother and I would be

1028
01:27:24,227 --> 01:27:26,787
if we were in their position.

1029
01:27:27,797 --> 01:27:29,389
And...

1030
01:27:29,732 --> 01:27:32,963
...I thank God every day,

1031
01:27:33,703 --> 01:27:35,864
every day,

1032
01:27:36,072 --> 01:27:39,007
that I have children I can trust.

1033
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:45,872
So when you go back to school,

1034
01:27:46,082 --> 01:27:50,712
and you're shivering and it's cold
and everything is miserable,

1035
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:53,718
go to a store in Boston,

1036
01:27:54,357 --> 01:27:59,886
buy yourself a leather coat
with a fox-fur collar.

1037
01:28:01,464 --> 01:28:02,761
Now...

1038
01:28:05,668 --> 01:28:09,160
What is wrong?
It's a wedding. It's a wedding!

1039
01:28:09,372 --> 01:28:10,771
A celebration!

1040
01:28:34,264 --> 01:28:36,755
Anything my daughter wants
is good enough for me.

1041
01:28:36,966 --> 01:28:40,163
There's not a business in the world
can't use another person.

1042
01:29:06,262 --> 01:29:09,993
- It's a hell of a wedding.
- A-OK.

1043
01:29:14,737 --> 01:29:16,227
Carlotta.

1044
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:18,202
- Flowers.
- Oh.

1045
01:29:18,408 --> 01:29:21,002
Ben, get Julie.

1046
01:29:22,845 --> 01:29:25,177
Harry. Harry.

1047
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:28,748
- Harry, wake up already!
- What?

1048
01:29:29,118 --> 01:29:30,386
I must have dozed.

1049
01:29:30,586 --> 01:29:31,586
I must have dozed.

1050
01:29:40,229 --> 01:29:45,428
I know. I know you're tired, darling,
I know. I know, I know.

1051
01:29:45,635 --> 01:29:50,072
I got more brains in my pinky

1052
01:29:50,273 --> 01:29:52,741
than my brother Ben

1053
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:57,339
has in his whole body.

1054
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:03,648
Why? Why?

1055
01:30:03,853 --> 01:30:07,721
Why is he at the top
and me at the bottom?

1056
01:30:07,924 --> 01:30:09,551
Why?

1057
01:30:09,759 --> 01:30:11,454
Why?

1058
01:30:11,661 --> 01:30:14,323
Your wife and your child
are exhausted.

1059
01:30:14,797 --> 01:30:16,924
Go home.

1060
01:30:21,337 --> 01:30:23,328
You'll go...

1061
01:30:24,807 --> 01:30:27,105
You'll go far.

1062
01:30:29,746 --> 01:30:32,214
You're a smart boy.

1063
01:30:33,683 --> 01:30:35,844
Play it safe.

1064
01:30:36,452 --> 01:30:39,353
Don't louse things up.

1065
01:30:40,056 --> 01:30:44,959
The next time I see you,
it'll be your wedding.

1066
01:31:19,929 --> 01:31:21,863
- Where were you?
- Where were you?

1067
01:31:22,065 --> 01:31:24,192
Looking for you.

1068
01:31:25,301 --> 01:31:29,635
I went out for a walk with Don.

1069
01:31:30,306 --> 01:31:35,266
I drank too much and got sick.
I feel terrible.

1070
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:48,524
What a horrible way
to spend our last night together.

1071
01:33:07,069 --> 01:33:09,663
<i>Neil, I have bad news,</i>
<i>I can't come in next week.</i>

1072
01:33:09,872 --> 01:33:12,636
- <i>I just got your letter.</i>
- <i>Why don't you come up here.</i>

1073
01:33:12,842 --> 01:33:14,707
<i>I can't, really.</i>

1074
01:33:14,911 --> 01:33:16,242
<i>It's the Jewish holidays.</i>

1075
01:33:16,445 --> 01:33:19,812
<i>My aunt is having</i>
<i>the whole family over for dinner.</i>

1076
01:33:21,651 --> 01:33:23,619
I'll get a hotel room.

1077
01:33:25,388 --> 01:33:27,288
Certainly make it tempting.

1078
01:33:46,075 --> 01:33:48,669
- Hi.
- Hello.

1079
01:33:52,949 --> 01:33:56,578
- Did you get my suitcase?
- Yeah.

1080
01:34:13,236 --> 01:34:15,898
I have a reservation,
Mr. And Mrs. Neil Klugman.

1081
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:18,173
Arthur!

1082
01:34:26,115 --> 01:34:28,015
Follow him.

1083
01:34:56,112 --> 01:34:58,876
- Your heart's pounding.
- I know.

1084
01:34:59,081 --> 01:35:01,675
- Are you nervous?
- No.

1085
01:35:12,295 --> 01:35:14,126
What's the matter?

1086
01:35:15,932 --> 01:35:17,923
Something the matter?

1087
01:35:21,337 --> 01:35:23,134
Yes.

1088
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:27,639
Well, what is it? You didn't
mention anything on the phone.

1089
01:35:27,843 --> 01:35:31,677
- I only found out about it today.
- What?

1090
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:35,583
They found out about us.

1091
01:35:39,488 --> 01:35:42,787
About our sleeping together
this summer.

1092
01:35:45,161 --> 01:35:47,152
I don't get it.

1093
01:35:48,497 --> 01:35:52,433
- My mother found the thing.
- The diaphragm?

1094
01:35:52,635 --> 01:35:55,900
- Yes.
- Where?

1095
01:35:56,339 --> 01:35:59,308
She was cleaning out the dresser.

1096
01:36:01,277 --> 01:36:05,839
- The dresser in your home?
- Of course in my home.

1097
01:36:06,615 --> 01:36:11,245
- You left the thing home?
- Well, I didn't plan on using it here.

1098
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:15,923
Well, suppose I came up?
I mean... I mean, I have come up.

1099
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:20,824
- What about that?
- I thought I'd go home first.

1100
01:36:21,263 --> 01:36:23,754
Couldn't you carry it with you
like a toothbrush?

1101
01:36:23,966 --> 01:36:26,992
- Are you trying to be funny?
- No, why'd you leave it home?

1102
01:36:27,203 --> 01:36:31,230
I told you,
I thought I'd go down there first.

1103
01:36:32,141 --> 01:36:33,540
Brenda, Brenda, look.

1104
01:36:34,577 --> 01:36:37,341
Listen, that doesn't make any sense.

1105
01:36:38,514 --> 01:36:41,506
Suppose you did go home,
and then you came back up?

1106
01:36:41,717 --> 01:36:45,847
Wouldn't you carry it with?
Wouldn't you carry it with you then?

1107
01:36:46,055 --> 01:36:48,148
I don't know.

1108
01:36:53,662 --> 01:36:56,358
What'd she do,
call you on the phone?

1109
01:36:56,766 --> 01:37:01,362
No, they each wrote me a little letter.
Look in my bag, read them.

1110
01:37:01,771 --> 01:37:03,762
Go ahead.

1111
01:37:08,978 --> 01:37:11,674
Read my father's first.

1112
01:37:28,431 --> 01:37:30,763
She never looked
in your drawer before?

1113
01:37:30,966 --> 01:37:33,366
How do I know?
Maybe she did, maybe she didn't.

1114
01:37:33,569 --> 01:37:36,504
- I couldn't think of everything.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1115
01:37:36,705 --> 01:37:39,640
What are you
confusing everything for?

1116
01:37:39,842 --> 01:37:42,538
You know, you act as though
I did it on purpose.

1117
01:37:42,745 --> 01:37:45,680
- Do you believe that?
- I don't know.

1118
01:37:45,948 --> 01:37:49,111
- Neil, are you crazy?
- Brenda.

1119
01:37:49,318 --> 01:37:51,684
What's crazier
than leaving that thing there?

1120
01:37:51,887 --> 01:37:54,219
- It was an oversight.
- Now it's an oversight.

1121
01:37:54,423 --> 01:37:57,586
- Before, it was deliberate.
- An oversight about the drawer.

1122
01:37:57,793 --> 01:37:59,852
It was not an oversight about leaving it.

1123
01:38:00,062 --> 01:38:01,996
Brenda, darling, darling,

1124
01:38:02,198 --> 01:38:05,531
wouldn't the safest, smartest,
easiest, simplest thing have been

1125
01:38:05,734 --> 01:38:08,931
to take that with you?
Wouldn't that be the smartest thing?

1126
01:38:09,138 --> 01:38:11,800
You make it seem as though
I wanted her to find it.

1127
01:38:12,007 --> 01:38:14,407
Do you think I need this?
I can't even go home.

1128
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:16,202
- Is that so?
- Yes!

1129
01:38:16,412 --> 01:38:18,676
No! No! No!

1130
01:38:18,881 --> 01:38:20,508
It isn't so!

1131
01:38:20,716 --> 01:38:23,947
Your father will be waiting there
with two coats and six dresses!

1132
01:38:24,153 --> 01:38:27,316
- What about my mother?
- It'll be the same with her!

1133
01:38:27,523 --> 01:38:30,788
Neil, don't be absurd.
I can't even face them.

1134
01:38:30,993 --> 01:38:32,893
Why not?
Did you do anything wrong?

1135
01:38:33,395 --> 01:38:38,332
- Look at the reality of it, will you?
- Did you do anything wrong?

1136
01:38:38,534 --> 01:38:41,560
They think it's wrong.
They're my parents.

1137
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:45,467
- But do you think it's wrong?
- That doesn't matter.

1138
01:38:45,674 --> 01:38:48,905
- It does to me.
- Now what are you accusing me of?

1139
01:38:49,111 --> 01:38:51,306
- You are guilty of some things.
- What?

1140
01:38:51,514 --> 01:38:54,312
Of leaving the
goddamn diaphragm there!

1141
01:38:54,817 --> 01:39:00,255
Don't start giving me
any of your psychoanalytic crap now!

1142
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:04,786
Why did you leave it home?
You wanted her to find it.

1143
01:39:04,994 --> 01:39:09,294
- Why?
- I don't know, Brenda. Why?

1144
01:39:15,404 --> 01:39:18,168
What does your father
capitalize all these letters for?

1145
01:39:18,374 --> 01:39:21,969
My God, look at this, my God.

1146
01:39:23,245 --> 01:39:25,679
"As for your mistake, it takes two",
capital T,

1147
01:39:25,881 --> 01:39:27,712
"to make a mistake", capital M,

1148
01:39:27,917 --> 01:39:31,580
"and now that you will be away
at school and from him,

1149
01:39:31,787 --> 01:39:35,780
"you will probably do all right.
I have every faith you will", capital F.

1150
01:39:35,991 --> 01:39:39,483
"Your father."
Your father, your father, your father.

1151
01:39:39,695 --> 01:39:41,492
Your father.

1152
01:39:45,267 --> 01:39:47,292
What are you gonna do?

1153
01:39:50,739 --> 01:39:53,674
Neil, be realistic.
How can I take you home?

1154
01:39:53,876 --> 01:39:58,438
Can you just see us all sitting around
the table having Thanksgiving dinner?

1155
01:40:01,717 --> 01:40:04,743
Neil, you don't understand.
They're my parents.

1156
01:40:04,954 --> 01:40:09,084
They've given me everything
I've ever wanted, haven't they?

1157
01:40:12,561 --> 01:40:14,654
How can I not go home?

1158
01:40:15,798 --> 01:40:17,322
I have to go home.

1159
01:40:21,136 --> 01:40:23,570
Neil, you don't understand.

1160
01:40:27,843 --> 01:40:30,334
You don't understand anything.
All you've ever done

1161
01:40:30,546 --> 01:40:33,515
is accuse me of things
and criticize me of things.

1162
01:40:33,716 --> 01:40:36,207
Analyze me,
telling me why don't I have this fixed,

1163
01:40:36,418 --> 01:40:38,352
why don't I have that fixed.

1164
01:40:38,554 --> 01:40:43,150
As if it were my fault,
that I could have them fixed.

1165
01:41:49,124 --> 01:41:50,150
---the end---
