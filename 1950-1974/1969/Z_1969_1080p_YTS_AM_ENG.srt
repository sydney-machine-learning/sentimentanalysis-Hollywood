1
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,494
Mildew is prevented

2
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:14,233
by spraying vines
with a solution of copper sulfate.

3
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,572
There are two standard remedies:

4
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,033
Bordeaux mixture and Burgundy mixture,

5
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,470
named after the French province

6
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,173
famous for its wines.

7
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:29,675
The vines are sprayed
three times a year:

8
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:33,290
first, when shoots
are about five inches long,

9
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:37,750
second, just before
or after the blossoms appear,

10
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:40,148
and the third time
a month later.

11
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,224
Spraying is preventive and thus essential.

12
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,324
Gentlemen, l conclude

13
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,252
on how to fight mildew.

14
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:50,966
May l remind you:
As in previous years,

15
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,612
planes and leaflets
will be at your disposal.

16
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,189
The leaflets remind
peasants that mildew,

17
00:01:57,716 --> 00:02:00,805
which infects the vines
first appeared

18
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,661
together with the ideological malady
that infects humanity.

19
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:08,334
On this matter, l give the floor
to the chief of military police.

20
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:15,756
ANY SIMILARITY TO REAL PERSONS
AND EVENTS IS NOT COlNCIDENTAL.

21
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:20,916
lT IS INTENTlONAL.

22
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,327
As the deputy minister
of agriculture explained,

23
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,426
three sprayings are required
to prevent mildew.

24
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,166
As with mildew
this ideological disease

25
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,312
must be fought preventively.

26
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:38,371
lt is caused
by harmful germs

27
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,861
and various parasites.

28
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:45,285
So the spraying of humans

29
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:47,214
with appropriate mixtures

30
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:49,007
is indispensable.

31
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:52,939
Schools, in this case
constitute the first stage.

32
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:56,296
That is where
if you'll excuse the metaphor,

33
00:02:57,082 --> 00:03:00,112
young shoots have not yet
reached four or five inches.

34
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:02,434
The second spraying

35
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:05,081
is just before or after blossoming.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,619
l refer to universities
and young workers.

37
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:11,046
Military service

38
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:15,035
is the best time to protect
the sacred tree of national liberty

39
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:18,229
against infection
from ideological mildew.

40
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:22,141
This year, leaflets are
being dropped by air

41
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,047
to inform our peasantry

42
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:29,210
of the ideological mildew
threatening our country.

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,588
This new variety,

44
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,207
more diffuse and insidious,

45
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:35,914
is a crafty enemy

46
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,858
that is growing away
from God and the crown.

47
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,236
lt is against this enemy
in particular

48
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:43,480
that our preventive action
is aimed.

49
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,383
No need to take notes.
It's all in the circular.

50
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:52,322
With the outbreak of such ''isms''

51
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:56,762
as socialism, anarchism
imperialism, communism, etc.,

52
00:03:57,464 --> 00:04:01,818
sunspots began to swarm
across the face of the diurnal orb.

53
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:06,344
God casts no light on the Reds.

54
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:10,228
Scientists have announced
a major increase in sunspots

55
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,779
since the advent
of beatniks, Provos

56
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,986
and, most of all, pacifist tendencies
from Italy, France and Scandinavia.

57
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:22,983
As the chief of law and order
in the north,

58
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:27,721
l use this occasion to address
you high-ranking civil servants.

59
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:30,223
We must preserve

60
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,611
the healthy parts of our society

61
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:35,710
and heal the infected parts.

62
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,111
Tonight the enemy
will meet in our city.

63
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,191
But our system is not an ''ism.''

64
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,157
This is a democracy.

65
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,611
We shall not ban their meeting,

66
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,789
but neither shall we forbid

67
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,417
those who don't think like them
from demonstrating.

68
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:55,581
lt is with these healthy parts,
these antibodies,

69
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:59,322
that we must combat
and eradicate all diseases

70
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,985
those of the vine
and those of society.

71
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:05,392
That's all l have to say.

72
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:14,023
Bear all this in mind
in the days to come.

73
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:19,337
- Lunch with me?
- A quick one.

74
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,447
Then l'll take you to your plane.

75
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,764
- That's kind of you.
- My pleasure.

76
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,936
Tell my wife
l'll pick her up tonight.

77
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:35,860
Mr. Head of Security?

78
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:38,691
The Bolshoi ballerinas
are visiting our city.

79
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:43,715
From Moscow?

80
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:47,869
The Bolshoi is here for four days.
Tonight is the premiere.

81
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:51,483
Stay over. l have a box.

82
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:53,584
l must be in the capital.

83
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,799
The capital... the palace.

84
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:58,408
The palace thinks highly of you.

85
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:06,588
lt would be funny
if one of them defected here.

86
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:09,217
Like that famous dancer -

87
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,298
Oh, no. None of that.

88
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,603
Defectors prefer London or the U.S.,
countries with strong currency.

89
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:23,084
Our city has enough hotheads
who give us headaches.

90
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:25,501
Stop! Take that down.

91
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,541
We don't need a permit
for an indoor meeting.

92
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:32,474
l don't care! l don't want trouble.
Get a permit, or no hall.

93
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,293
Do as l say!

94
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,702
This is my hall.

95
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,964
Get a permit,
or find another place.

96
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,278
Take it down.

97
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,685
How do we find a hall now

98
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:47,157
and inform thousands of people
coming from all over town?

99
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,587
- l didn't know the topic.
- It was on your receipt.

100
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,336
Not anymore.

101
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:56,957
Here's your check.

102
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:59,691
l'll pay damages.
If you don't mind...

103
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:04,237
- They threatened you.
- l don't know what you mean.

104
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:07,719
You don't cancel a rental
unless you're under pressure.

105
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,059
You lawyers -

106
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:12,629
Mr. Bozini, you're an honest man.

107
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,889
Who's behind all this?
What's the real reason?

108
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,531
Leave me alone!
l don't want you is all.

109
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:24,405
lf you don't like it, lump it.
- We should be the ones upset.

110
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,784
My father died today, okay?

111
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:39,395
l'd gladly rent it to you again,

112
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:42,445
but we had an inspection
by the city.

113
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:43,779
When?

114
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:46,780
Yesterday.
The seats have to comply.

115
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,955
l'll bring some kids
to set them up today.

116
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:54,175
They have to be bolted to the floor.
That takes a week.

117
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,351
They were never bolted before.

118
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,305
We either cancel
or meet outside.

119
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:01,166
And without a permit.

120
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,975
That'd mean agitators,
club-wielding cops, wounded.

121
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:07,504
We won't find a hall.
They'll all refuse.

122
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,941
l say we cancel.

123
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,262
He'd never agree.

124
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,599
We cancel
and go quietly off to bed.

125
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,840
Better yet,
we all attend the Bolshoi.

126
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:23,042
And we take him to the Bolshoi
and send his audience to the Bolshoi.

127
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,652
You know a hall?

128
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:25,956
The Bolshoi.

129
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:27,692
They plan to murder the doctor.

130
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:29,735
- Says who?
- My wife.

131
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:32,612
Who told you?
None of my business?

132
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:35,202
What do we tell the police?

133
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,331
Wait, don't hang up.

134
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:41,502
She won't say. The person didn't know
the doctor's due today.

135
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:47,181
This is Georges Pirou.
You must tell us who -

136
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,109
Out of the question.

137
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,319
l trust him. He didn't know
about tonight's meeting.

138
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,984
He overheard a conversation.

139
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,207
He won't tell you. Nor will l.

140
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:03,321
He's already had trouble.
He has a family.

141
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:05,182
Now they know.

142
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:08,031
Now you know,
so do something.

143
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,053
Back to you.

144
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:13,113
l know, darling.

145
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:14,629
See you later.

146
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:16,843
So... what do we do?

147
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,213
We call the Red Cross.

148
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:21,197
The prosecutor.

149
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:23,480
Admit it's all vague.

150
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,590
An anonymous informant,

151
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:28,075
a conversation overheard
somewhere.

152
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,201
Maybe it's a practical joke,
or a crackpot.

153
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:35,037
Like those people who phone
about a bomb on a plane.

154
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,981
Who'd want to kill your leader?

155
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:40,302
Marie, get the door, please.

156
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:42,498
Let's go.

157
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,452
l'll call the head of security.

158
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:56,596
He'll provide protection,
unofficially.

159
00:09:57,718 --> 00:09:59,799
We have no grounds
for any action.

160
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:04,364
Yes, you can be prosecutor
and appreciate the Paris Commune.

161
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:07,672
Ah, my friend!
Niki!

162
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:10,080
- Sorry l'm late.
- l'll just be a minute.

163
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,487
Coming to the theater with us?

164
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,307
As for a hall
l can't help you -

165
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:17,974
The colonel.

166
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:22,442
Property rights
are still protected here,

167
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,798
even if some people
may want to change that.

168
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:27,601
About time.

169
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,122
- Yes, Papa?
- Niki, see to our guest.

170
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:32,704
Just a minute.

171
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,566
One of our finest magistrates.

172
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:40,617
He's out?
Give me his duty officer.

173
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,162
You know about tonight?
l don't mean the Bolshoi.

174
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,396
Exactly. There was a threat
on the doctor's life.

175
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:55,980
No, but he's due to arrive -
- Shortly.

176
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,244
He'll be here shortly.

177
00:10:59,835 --> 00:11:01,264
On the phone.

178
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:03,220
As you say.

179
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:04,889
lnform the colonel.

180
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,037
''All vague.''

181
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,637
''No grounds for action.''

182
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:12,082
They think it's a publicity stunt.

183
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,749
The doctor will be furious that
we asked these sellouts for protection.

184
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:16,542
- Sellouts?
- To the Americans.

185
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:19,131
What do they have
to do with this?

186
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,306
Always blame the Americans.
Even if you're wrong.

187
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:24,944
Cut it out.
You're not always funny.

188
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,724
See who that is?

189
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,439
There they are.

190
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,357
Police?

191
00:12:57,816 --> 00:13:00,655
So it seems. They've been
tailing me for three days.

192
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:03,159
Everything set for tonight?

193
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:06,572
No. We lost our hall
and nobody even knows it.

194
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:09,345
They're out to sabotage
the meeting, Doctor.

195
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:10,937
Who can fix it?

196
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:13,469
Only the head of security.

197
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:15,655
We'll see him after lunch.

198
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:17,707
Let's go now.

199
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,841
Back to the hotel.

200
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:26,674
Your life's been threatened.
Some guy overheard talk about it.

201
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:30,664
We'll ask the police to -
- To do nothing. It looks bad.

202
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:33,311
We just talk about a hall.

203
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:38,740
Gentlemen
we have a problem.

204
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,789
This hall doesn't comply
with safety standards.

205
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:45,414
There were shows there
just two weeks ago, sir.

206
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:48,646
Here's the report.

207
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:50,852
There's no emergency exit.

208
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:52,856
lt never had one.

209
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:55,829
Counselor
with a normal show

210
00:13:56,443 --> 00:13:58,438
there's no danger.

211
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:02,907
But a meeting
can get people worked up.

212
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,677
Our meeting presents no danger.

213
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:10,358
l have no reason
to stop your meeting.

214
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:13,131
The reports
of competent services

215
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,279
dictate my decisions.

216
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:17,283
l'm neutral in this affair.

217
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:19,384
Then why are we being tailed?

218
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:21,004
For your safety.

219
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,920
The minister of the interior
issued orders

220
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:27,132
to protect
your committee members

221
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,579
from possible extremist attacks.

222
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,926
Extremists under your control.

223
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,873
Mr. Deputy...

224
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:38,027
other halls meet safety standards.

225
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,420
Like the Employees' Union Hall
opposite your hotel.

226
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,182
You only have
to cross the square.

227
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,835
l'm neutral in this affair.
Believe me.

228
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,761
Fine, Colonel.

229
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:59,530
There it is,
on the second floor.

230
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,371
A tiny space

231
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,231
for no more than 200 people.

232
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:07,652
We'll look pathetic. In a city
of 500,000, only 200 will hear you.

233
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:09,771
The others stay outside.
It's pathetic.

234
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:14,240
Ask the colonel to let us use the square
and hang loudspeakers in the trees.

235
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:17,357
Permit or no permit,
we'll have a turnout.

236
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:20,455
We'll be going now.

237
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:46,934
We'll try to contact supporters
going to the Picadilly.

238
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:51,567
Print up flyers
about the change in venue.

239
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,654
Manuel
Iet's discuss my speech.

240
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:56,832
Georges, you too.

241
00:15:58,203 --> 00:15:59,440
l'll hold.

242
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,758
Hello, darling.
How are you?

243
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:08,867
Fine. Just fine.

244
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:14,603
Problems with the hall, as usual.

245
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,564
Why would there be fighting?

246
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,326
l said
why would there be fighting?

247
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:23,646
Yes, tomorrow.

248
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,367
Georges sends his love.

249
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,746
See you tomorrow, honey.

250
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,691
How are the kids?

251
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,490
Fine, but l don't
see them enough.

252
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,332
And Hélène?

253
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,470
We have our problems.

254
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:42,357
We've grown apart somewhat,
but it's nothing.

255
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,505
We have a saying:
''A hungry bear

256
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,174
doesn't dance.''

257
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,995
The bears won't dance.
They'll read this.

258
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:53,579
Your pen.

259
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:06,440
MEETING MOVED TO UNlON HALL

260
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:21,775
Get going.

261
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,808
Hold your meetings in Russia!

262
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,322
lf you don't mind,
we'd rather stay here!

263
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,191
Do as you're told!

264
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:50,796
Hey, you.

265
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,106
What's the idea?

266
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,173
- lgnore them.
- More fun than the Bolshoi.

267
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:56,958
Call that fun?

268
00:19:57,302 --> 00:20:00,333
l'm only doing you a favor.
- Your Russians are old hat.

269
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,642
Except when one defects.

270
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,161
And the Warsaw Pact?

271
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:10,479
We're against the bomb,
Russian or American.

272
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:13,194
Disarmament!

273
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,054
Long live the bomb!

274
00:20:33,717 --> 00:20:36,777
No more foreign bases!

275
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:42,272
You can always sell 'em
to <i>The Daily Worker</i>.

276
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,351
- They're blasé.
- So are these guys.

277
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,115
No more NATO bases!

278
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,223
Keep calm!
Don't provoke them!

279
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,368
You're too easy on them!

280
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,084
Don't bother with them.

281
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,601
Calm down!

282
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,288
Don't provoke them!

283
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,677
Counselor!

284
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:05,002
You have to start now.
The hall is full.

285
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:09,029
- Squeeze 'em in.
- Get the speakers.

286
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:13,182
Do we start?
- l'll go get them.

287
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:21,862
Go on in.

288
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:26,609
Forget about them.
Go on in.

289
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:41,598
We'll crush you like slugs!

290
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,054
Trash!

291
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,131
- It's all clear now.
- Who is it?

292
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:59,628
The new face of the opposition.
Young people and women go for him.

293
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:01,163
Communist?

294
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:04,520
No way.
He's against foreign influence.

295
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:07,272
The next elections are his.

296
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,066
He's got presence.

297
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:14,120
Ex-Olympic champion, doctor, academic
and honest politician. Perfection!

298
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:17,083
He's at the Bolshoi too.

299
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:19,174
He has to cancel the meeting.

300
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:22,549
- Sure, chicken out.
- It's to avoid any provocation.

301
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,492
- The students can keep order.
- They're asking for a fight.

302
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:28,899
You and your nonviolence!

303
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:31,209
Our strength lies
in respecting the law.

304
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,127
The law of the jungle.

305
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,487
We shouldn't have
taken this hall.

306
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,329
lt's a set-up.

307
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,237
A set-up by whom?

308
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,475
We want foreign bases dismantled.
It's the CIA.

309
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,374
Aren't you going too far

310
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:47,714
over some stubborn extremists?

311
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:50,765
- And the death threats?
- It's not the first time.

312
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:53,450
We all know the risks.

313
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:56,614
No one.
All at the Bolshoi.

314
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:02,015
Keep trying.
The police have responsibilities.

315
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,208
We're going to our meeting.

316
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,057
Politicians! All corrupt!

317
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:41,450
Cowards!

318
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:43,810
We'll send you to your graves!

319
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,233
We'll kill you all!

320
00:24:11,736 --> 00:24:14,259
Down with the police state!

321
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:18,266
Stay outside.

322
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,054
- Who are you?
- l'm a mason.

323
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:55,313
l'm all right.
We can start.

324
00:26:17,247 --> 00:26:18,761
They struck me.

325
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,197
Why?

326
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:24,574
Why do the ideas we stand for

327
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:27,604
incite such violence?

328
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,646
Why is peace
intolerable to them?

329
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:36,860
Why don't they attack
other organizations and movements?

330
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:39,545
The answer is simple.

331
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:43,917
The other movements are national,
for domestic purposes,

332
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,150
and thus leave
our allies indifferent...

333
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:50,766
Sir, we can't control them.
We have to stop this.

334
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:53,527
l'll have the loudspeakers cut off.

335
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:57,123
lt'll excite the others.

336
00:26:58,332 --> 00:26:59,224
Out of the question.

337
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:04,202
Where are your superiors?
The colonel?

338
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,455
l was told he was here.

339
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,054
He must be
somewhere over there.

340
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:13,044
We lack hospitals and doctors,

341
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:16,745
but half the budget
goes for military expenditures.

342
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:19,152
Long live the army!

343
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,387
Come out, you cowards!

344
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,053
lt's him!

345
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:48,548
Defend yourself, you coward!

346
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,137
A single cannon is fired

347
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:54,974
and a teacher's monthly salary
goes up in smoke.

348
00:27:57,947 --> 00:27:59,682
That's why they cannot

349
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,568
tolerate this meeting
or our presence

350
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:06,521
and employ hired thugs
to shout us down and attack us.

351
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:12,006
Worldwide, there are
too many soIdiers ready to fire

352
00:28:12,956 --> 00:28:15,622
at the slightest display
of progress.

353
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:17,481
That your man?

354
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:19,247
- That's what they said.
- Is it him?

355
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,884
- They said it was.
- That runt, an Olympic champ?

356
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:40,778
Turn it off!

357
00:28:46,302 --> 00:28:47,558
Finish him off.

358
00:28:56,189 --> 00:28:57,502
lt's not him!

359
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:00,389
- l told you it wasn't.
- They said it was.

360
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:03,862
Take off!

361
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:19,839
l'll go around to avoid the cops.

362
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:23,733
Out-of-season tomatoes.
They cost a fortune.

363
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,188
- What?
- Fix your muffler.

364
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,257
l can't even make
the monthly payments.

365
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:34,292
Salaried workers without pay,

366
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:38,637
confined to this subproletariat
where they are manpiulated...

367
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:41,504
Shit! The cops!

368
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,353
They'll never know
that our struggle is theirs too,

369
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:47,382
for we Iive in a weak
and corrupt society

370
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:50,902
where it's every man for himself

371
00:29:51,737 --> 00:29:53,395
lt's blocked off here too.

372
00:29:54,202 --> 00:29:55,123
Get down.

373
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,085
Even imagination is suspect,

374
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:02,613
yet it is required
to solve the problems of our planet,

375
00:30:03,322 --> 00:30:07,225
where the destructive power
of stockpiled nuclear warheads

376
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:11,138
equals a ton of dynamite
for each person.

377
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:14,265
One-track mind!

378
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:22,167
They want to prevent us
from reaching

379
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,684
the obvious political conclusions
based on these simple truths.

380
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,542
But we will speak.

381
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:33,283
We serve the people,
and the people require the truth.

382
00:30:36,093 --> 00:30:38,394
No photos.
Send them back to the Bolshoi.

383
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,675
The truth is the start
of powerful, united action.

384
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:54,363
Clear these hoodlums out.

385
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:09,736
Down with the police state!

386
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:22,030
No more foreign bases!

387
00:31:36,283 --> 00:31:38,047
Mr. Chief of Police!

388
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,127
Mr. Head of Security!

389
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,821
What are you waiting for?

390
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:01,888
Watch out!

391
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:25,031
Throw him off!

392
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:43,863
lt's my cousin.
He fell off.

393
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,942
Get his feet.

394
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:51,747
l saw you hit him.

395
00:33:52,312 --> 00:33:54,470
- What's that?
- What's the problem?

396
00:33:55,257 --> 00:33:59,525
l hit the brake and my cousin fell out.
He's bleeding and needs first aid.

397
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:01,376
Your papers.

398
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:04,300
Just a second.

399
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:10,937
How stupid of me.

400
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:14,304
He's bleeding.
He needs first aid.

401
00:34:15,484 --> 00:34:17,813
He hit him.
He has a club there.

402
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:27,990
See? Nothing serious.

403
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:29,715
And this? Move it.

404
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,873
He meant to kill him.

405
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:33,072
Fathead!

406
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,048
- And my three-wheeler?
- No one will touch it.

407
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,474
Call the station
for a patrol car.

408
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,130
Sure, call the station.

409
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,680
Stay over there.

410
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,006
Come here.

411
00:34:57,279 --> 00:35:00,030
l'll run for it.
Pretend you're trying to catch me.

412
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,725
l can't explain.

413
00:35:03,992 --> 00:35:05,814
l gotta go.
Just play dumb.

414
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:07,637
One move and l'll hit you.

415
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:17,246
What time is it?

416
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,500
l got a date l can't miss.

417
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:38,095
The regime
couldn't change that.

418
00:35:44,953 --> 00:35:45,988
l mean it.

419
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:48,146
Russians all want
to live like Americans.

420
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,684
Come quickly, sir.
It's serious.

421
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,572
Come with me.

422
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:03,385
See you later.

423
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,950
Mr. Prosecutor.

424
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:15,920
We'll discuss it later.

425
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:18,702
l missed the ballet
because of all this.

426
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,067
- Why wasn't l informed earlier?
- During the show? How?

427
00:36:22,623 --> 00:36:25,856
- What happened?
- A stupid traffic accident.

428
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:29,241
- The culprit?
- We'll have him soon enough.

429
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:32,684
- The victim's condition?
- We're waiting for news.

430
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:35,896
l'll go.
l'll take your car.

431
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,354
Be my guest.

432
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,934
Has the press
heard about it yet?

433
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:42,303
l don't think so.

434
00:36:43,866 --> 00:36:45,947
Let's go.
l must call the minister.

435
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:56,459
Editorial offices.

436
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,537
What happened to you?

437
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:14,939
There was a demonstration.
We taught the bastards a lesson.

438
00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:19,590
They can't stop them from meeting
or keep us from reacting either.

439
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:21,960
lt's like a biological process.

440
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,685
You see...

441
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:28,241
we're society's healthy elements,
its antibodies.

442
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:30,619
We gave 'em hell.

443
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:32,989
What do you want from me?

444
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,109
Write...

445
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,107
that l was there
with the guys that thrashed 'em.

446
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:40,978
But why?

447
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:42,905
For my pals... so they know.

448
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,024
lf you want.

449
00:37:45,945 --> 00:37:47,797
But get over to the hospital.

450
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:51,307
And check in, so they know
both sides were hurt.

451
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,047
Go now and l'll get
your name in the lead.

452
00:38:16,702 --> 00:38:19,618
We warned you, but no,
it was a practical joke

453
00:38:20,184 --> 00:38:21,784
or a crackpot.
- Not now!

454
00:38:22,168 --> 00:38:25,141
No, now you have
an assassination on your hands.

455
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:28,815
The police have proof
it was an accident.

456
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,192
We need their help.

457
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:38,837
You'll put us in a bind
with unfounded accusations.

458
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,646
They're blind. Or worse...

459
00:38:42,462 --> 00:38:43,526
accomplices.

460
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:45,684
Calling it an accident
without proof.

461
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:48,015
- Attempted murder?
- Who are you?

462
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:50,691
l saw it all.
l was there taking photos.

463
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,896
Photos of the three-wheeler?

464
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:54,402
No, l missed it.

465
00:38:54,718 --> 00:38:56,426
The cops ejected us.

466
00:38:57,021 --> 00:39:00,339
What cynicism!
They'll use the incident politically.

467
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:03,954
- Predictable.
- They know how to make martyrs.

468
00:39:04,663 --> 00:39:07,924
Those necrophiliacs!
- Let's hope he doesn't die.

469
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:10,197
That would suit them.

470
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,016
lt's dreadful.

471
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:16,681
The brain is damaged in two
or three places. We're operating.

472
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:19,874
His heart is holding up,

473
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:22,866
but it's too early to tell.

474
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:24,621
But you must!

475
00:39:24,957 --> 00:39:26,165
He can't hear you.

476
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:28,257
Can't you see
the political repercussions?

477
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:30,979
But the other victim
is out of danger.

478
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,445
What other victim?

479
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:36,466
Deputy Georges Prou.
He was found in the street.

480
00:39:37,147 --> 00:39:38,911
lt's serious
but he'll be all right.

481
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,479
Two deputies hurt.
The police behaved scandalously.

482
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:47,495
l must phone the minister.
Where can l call in private?

483
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,528
This way.

484
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:54,889
They must have told his wife.

485
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:57,152
l don't listen in.

486
00:39:57,976 --> 00:39:58,811
l'm sure you don't.

487
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,249
lt's true.

488
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,484
When does she arrive?

489
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:04,221
Tomorrow, on the first flight.

490
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:06,657
Tomorrow... meaning today.

491
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,638
lt's for my paper.

492
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,937
So what did she say?

493
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:15,575
Nothing at first.

494
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,637
l heard her breathing.

495
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,863
Then she said,
''Will he live?''

496
00:40:21,023 --> 00:40:22,701
The director couldn't answer.

497
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:26,000
Then she said,
''So they finally got him.''

498
00:40:36,828 --> 00:40:38,823
Were you there tonight?

499
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:40,520
l'm a reporter.

500
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,227
No, wait!

501
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,507
The police bungled it.
They should have prevented all this.

502
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:52,114
Two deputies hurt, one critically.

503
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:53,909
We have the culprit.

504
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,730
Where?
l want to see him.

505
00:40:56,094 --> 00:40:57,888
Come with me.
He's in the canteen.

506
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:02,022
- The canteen?
- The cells are in bad shape.

507
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,848
No electricity.
The funds are pending, as usual.

508
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:07,978
So we use them for storage.

509
00:41:09,148 --> 00:41:12,935
l just spoke to the minister.
This could be politically disastrous.

510
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:16,215
lf the press hears
he's lazing about in a canteen!

511
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:19,285
The minister wants
a minute-by-minute update.

512
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:33,334
Not even handcuffed?

513
00:41:34,715 --> 00:41:36,873
His son?
- No, a street peddler.

514
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:38,859
- Was he alone?
- No, there were two.

515
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:41,227
We have the other's address.

516
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:44,297
He was asleep in the back
during the accident.

517
00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:46,684
He gave himself up?

518
00:41:47,097 --> 00:41:50,914
No, arrested for a minor offense -
drunk driving. You'll get a report.

519
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:54,252
Exhale.

520
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:58,587
No trace of alcohol.
- It's the stew.

521
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:01,607
lt's a fact that
mutton stew kills odors.

522
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:03,707
What were you doing until now?

523
00:42:04,282 --> 00:42:05,492
Making stew.

524
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:11,332
He's been here for hours
and you've kept it from me?

525
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,640
l didn't know.
l only found out later.

526
00:42:15,168 --> 00:42:17,806
You weren't informed?
How long have you been here?

527
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:20,155
Since 10:30 or 11:00 pm.

528
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:23,185
That's harboring a criminal!
You hid him from me.

529
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,852
You knew about it, Colonel?

530
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,413
l knew

531
00:42:28,768 --> 00:42:31,127
but l didn't have time
to inform the general.

532
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,900
Then you arrived.

533
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:36,190
When the general said
we didn't have the culprit,

534
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:38,425
l didn't dare contradict him.

535
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:41,071
Very well.

536
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,479
Find me an office.
l'll take his statement myself.

537
00:42:49,627 --> 00:42:51,708
Arrest the other culprit.

538
00:42:52,474 --> 00:42:53,712
Eat up.

539
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:05,259
They're in the pressroom.

540
00:43:14,265 --> 00:43:16,845
Now what?
Since when do you wear glasses?

541
00:43:18,686 --> 00:43:20,114
To avoid being recognized.

542
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:22,954
Take my name off the list.
The guy's dying.

543
00:43:23,864 --> 00:43:26,587
- Where do you fit into all this?
- Nowhere.

544
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:29,925
lt was an accident.
Two drunks in a three-wheeler.

545
00:43:30,396 --> 00:43:33,992
lf my name's in the paper,
l'll be questioned. l'd rather not be.

546
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,590
Okay, l'll take it out.
Now go.

547
00:43:38,778 --> 00:43:40,437
What are you up to now?

548
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,282
No, l can't.

549
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:46,488
l'm busy.

550
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:48,665
You have to go.

551
00:43:50,651 --> 00:43:51,993
That way.

552
00:44:51,646 --> 00:44:53,132
No one move!

553
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:56,239
What do they want now?

554
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:58,139
To start trouble.

555
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:00,258
But we're reasonable.
We refuse.

556
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,144
Why is it always
our people who get killed?

557
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:04,756
He's alive.

558
00:45:05,053 --> 00:45:07,298
He's clinically dead.
Why dream?

559
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,020
''Clinically dead,'' they said.

560
00:45:11,737 --> 00:45:15,055
His brain is dead,
but his heart's beating.

561
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:18,211
lt won't give up.

562
00:45:21,242 --> 00:45:23,907
Just say the word
and they'll tear up the town.

563
00:45:24,444 --> 00:45:27,955
Why hold them back?
l wonder if we have any fight left.

564
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:29,863
He had plenty.

565
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:32,367
That's why they killed him.
Us they leave alone.

566
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:34,064
Come on.

567
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:37,603
lt's all l could find.

568
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:42,657
The morning papers.
The police blame us for the clashes.

569
00:45:43,548 --> 00:45:44,499
Coffee?

570
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:47,941
''Broadcasting the speech
was a provocation.

571
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,060
The antinational tone

572
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,115
and the attack on foreign policy
immediately roused the crowd.

573
00:45:55,902 --> 00:45:58,482
Hence the climate of violence.

574
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:01,109
The police performed
their duty with serenity.

575
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:05,617
Thirteen officers were injured
in the course of duty.''

576
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,712
So said the general to the press.
We have to respond.

577
00:46:10,296 --> 00:46:14,036
Yes, and stress the pacifist nature
and calm of our meeting.

578
00:46:14,717 --> 00:46:16,003
We had permission.

579
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:18,401
So the police could sabotage it.

580
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:20,913
But we have no proof of that.

581
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,224
- We have plenty.
- Nothing concrete.

582
00:46:24,385 --> 00:46:27,138
We can only deplore police
passivity and ineffectiveness.

583
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:30,811
Only later can we exploit
the flaws politically.

584
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:35,931
Why not call in the Red Cross
or the Human Rights Commission?

585
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:40,622
That's a crybaby defense.

586
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:43,883
We have to go
after those responsible.

587
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:46,682
- Take up arms in the streets?
- Why not?

588
00:46:47,162 --> 00:46:48,477
- What nonsense.
- Intolerable.

589
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:52,706
- What we could do -
- We have to remain within the law.

590
00:46:53,406 --> 00:46:56,408
- We have been for years.
- It's no time to change.

591
00:46:56,992 --> 00:46:58,277
We must exploit this.

592
00:46:58,623 --> 00:47:00,983
- It mustn't turn against us.
- Exactly.

593
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:02,928
Aren't you ashamed?

594
00:47:03,514 --> 00:47:05,452
He's dying 10 feet from here.

595
00:47:10,457 --> 00:47:12,453
We have no valid case
against them.

596
00:47:12,894 --> 00:47:15,368
We have that death threat
yesterday.

597
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:17,267
He ignored it too.

598
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:20,077
But that was yesterday.
And today?

599
00:47:21,698 --> 00:47:24,085
Will your man talk now?

600
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,147
A statement to the press.

601
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,233
l doubt it.

602
00:47:36,092 --> 00:47:38,481
He was already
scared of reprisals.

603
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:40,284
Now even more so.

604
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:42,883
Try. Can you find him?

605
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:44,303
Not before noon.

606
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:46,460
We have to be careful.

607
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:49,913
They're watching our every move.

608
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:51,869
lt's them, all right.

609
00:47:52,186 --> 00:47:56,204
They're watching over us.
We can feel as safe as the doctor.

610
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:17,072
What was your reaction
to the news?

611
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,810
Did the American president
really send a telegram?

612
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:23,681
What did he say?

613
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:25,569
Are you a perfect couple?

614
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:30,327
Was he threatened?

615
00:48:30,623 --> 00:48:33,040
Will you let the Communists
use your husband's name?

616
00:48:33,693 --> 00:48:36,168
Was this a murder attempt?

617
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:39,053
Why did you call in
a British surgeon?

618
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,854
Were you really divorcing?

619
00:48:42,938 --> 00:48:44,396
Was it an accident?

620
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:55,147
They're operating
for the third time.

621
00:49:14,433 --> 00:49:16,563
Here's the hospital director.

622
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,922
This is the hospital director.
Your husband's had an accident.

623
00:49:26,556 --> 00:49:27,371
Nana!

624
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,504
l knew your husband.
We were in school together.

625
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:39,704
l wanted to take part
in his peace marathon,

626
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:41,824
but since it was banned
l couIdn't.

627
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,298
lt's serious
but he'll make it.

628
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,592
Professor Dodd
is here from London.

629
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,602
One of England's top surgeons.
He's optimistic.

630
00:49:53,946 --> 00:49:57,207
Tell the parents the truth?
They'll have time for that later.

631
00:50:08,187 --> 00:50:11,612
The fracture caused by the fall
ruptured the cranial vault.

632
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:14,756
There's no doubt
the brain mass has been affected.

633
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:19,706
The shock was very violent,
causing an explosion inside the skull,

634
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:22,142
a sort of cerebral earthquake.

635
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,719
l can't evaluate
the physical and mental effects

636
00:50:26,265 --> 00:50:28,787
of this concussion,
even if the operation succeeds.

637
00:50:29,305 --> 00:50:31,722
The third operation is underway.

638
00:50:32,221 --> 00:50:34,609
The only positive side
is his cardiac resistance.

639
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:38,550
When he came in, we did heart massage.
Adrenaline shots too.

640
00:50:39,193 --> 00:50:41,466
His heart
has incredible resistance.

641
00:50:41,945 --> 00:50:43,203
lt's beating regularly -

642
00:50:46,587 --> 00:50:48,295
Madam...

643
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:53,033
General Missou
chief of military police.

644
00:50:53,474 --> 00:50:56,810
A stupid accident
we all deplore.

645
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:59,035
The head of security.

646
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,512
We have the culprit,
a drunken thug.

647
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:02,144
The prosecutor.

648
00:51:02,498 --> 00:51:03,755
My sympathies, madam.

649
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:05,913
The magistrate.

650
00:51:21,564 --> 00:51:23,107
As l was saying,

651
00:51:23,482 --> 00:51:26,963
certain areas of the brain
could be relatively affected.

652
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:29,466
These lesions aren't yet clear.

653
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:32,047
But the surgeons are optimistic.

654
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:34,953
We must await the end
of the third operation.

655
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:38,242
Your husband has
an exceptional heart.

656
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,103
lf it holds out, he'll live.

657
00:51:41,626 --> 00:51:43,286
There's every reason to hope.

658
00:52:05,114 --> 00:52:07,838
A phone call
from the minister himself.

659
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,411
They'll exploit his wife,

660
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:19,347
play on people's emotions.
They're good at it.

661
00:52:23,585 --> 00:52:24,823
The files.

662
00:52:31,296 --> 00:52:32,839
Their committee secretary.

663
00:52:33,886 --> 00:52:35,678
l want summaries of each.

664
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:39,343
Details of their private lives.
Their jobs too.

665
00:52:39,936 --> 00:52:41,308
By tonight.

666
00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:43,515
The injured deputy.

667
00:52:47,552 --> 00:52:48,789
The other lawyer.

668
00:52:52,577 --> 00:52:54,255
And his file?

669
00:52:54,946 --> 00:52:56,317
lt just came in.

670
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:02,139
Any other women?

671
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:04,171
l don't know, but probably.

672
00:53:05,342 --> 00:53:08,152
Destroy his character.
Does he get along with his wife?

673
00:53:12,736 --> 00:53:15,037
- She being watched?
- Like the others, sir.

674
00:53:15,585 --> 00:53:18,529
We have two photographers -
- l'm not interested.

675
00:53:19,353 --> 00:53:20,083
The others?

676
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:23,525
They met this morning,
picked up his wife at the airport,

677
00:53:24,129 --> 00:53:25,473
then separated.

678
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:29,472
One group took her to the hospital.
As for him -

679
00:53:30,594 --> 00:53:32,694
He delivered a press release.

680
00:53:33,155 --> 00:53:34,584
You should have a copy.

681
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,449
Then he met
with some university students.

682
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:39,896
Students!

683
00:53:40,193 --> 00:53:41,373
Contact our students.

684
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:45,286
That one's a mad dog.
He'll make the most of it. No shame.

685
00:53:45,947 --> 00:53:47,579
- A Jew, naturally.
- A half-Jew.

686
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:50,657
Worst kind. They feel superior
even to other Jews.

687
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,867
- The prosecutor is here.
- Send him in.

688
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:57,150
Follow him night and day.

689
00:53:57,888 --> 00:53:59,374
Come in.

690
00:53:59,968 --> 00:54:01,369
We were expecting you.

691
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:05,120
- This second culprit?
- We have him.

692
00:54:05,665 --> 00:54:07,095
He turned himself in today.

693
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:08,937
Come into my office.

694
00:54:13,569 --> 00:54:15,141
Please sit down.

695
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,742
He's in charge now.
It's official.

696
00:54:21,566 --> 00:54:24,598
Give him the file
containing your initial findings,

697
00:54:25,183 --> 00:54:27,120
then follow his instructions.

698
00:54:27,676 --> 00:54:29,440
My deputy will report to me.

699
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,512
The colonel's men inquired -

700
00:54:32,193 --> 00:54:33,823
When can l question
the second culprit?

701
00:54:34,753 --> 00:54:36,096
Whenever you like.

702
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:40,767
lt seems he was asleep in the back
of the three-wheeler, dead drunk,

703
00:54:41,438 --> 00:54:43,884
so he's innocent
if it all checks out.

704
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:46,732
Their whereabouts earlier?

705
00:54:47,135 --> 00:54:49,887
l have the driver's statement.
Here's his photo.

706
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:54,375
lt seems they'd been out drinking
at the Chinaman's bar.

707
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,260
There are Chinese merchants
in our city?

708
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,319
The owner fought in Korea,
in a volunteer battalion,

709
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:03,332
so he's called the Chinaman.

710
00:55:03,707 --> 00:55:05,501
He confirms their statements.

711
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:08,196
And this is his.
l'll read it.

712
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:13,719
''l, Bertrand... aka the Chinaman
bar owner, etc...

713
00:55:14,457 --> 00:55:18,084
do hereby declare
that on May 22 of this year

714
00:55:18,754 --> 00:55:22,015
Yago and Vago
entered my bar at 7:00 p.m.

715
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,720
and remained until 10:00 p.m.

716
00:55:25,343 --> 00:55:27,922
l saw them start
with several glasses of anisette...''

717
00:55:29,755 --> 00:55:31,126
lt's not allowed, madam.

718
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:08,932
Thirteenth witness... a dockhand.

719
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,567
''l saw Vago and Yago
drinking all evening.

720
00:56:13,122 --> 00:56:16,384
By the time they left at 10:00 p.m.,
they were drunk.

721
00:56:16,988 --> 00:56:19,347
The Chinaman said
'Leave the kamikaze.''''

722
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:21,034
Kamikaze?

723
00:56:21,342 --> 00:56:24,881
A three-wheel hauler.
Japanese model.

724
00:56:25,724 --> 00:56:27,805
This is like the Far East.

725
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,211
l think it's clear enough.

726
00:56:31,584 --> 00:56:34,673
Though we lack
background on the culprits,

727
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,262
the theory of an accident
seems valid.

728
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:38,423
l agree.

729
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,738
Besides, the minister phoned
and wants this settled quickly

730
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:46,689
to cut short
political speculation abroad.

731
00:56:47,294 --> 00:56:51,282
l think my office
must make a statement today

732
00:56:52,002 --> 00:56:55,061
about the accident
and say that the culprits are in jail

733
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:59,665
on charges of drunken driving
and assault and battery.

734
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:01,947
And hit-and-run.

735
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:03,559
Naturally.

736
00:57:05,246 --> 00:57:07,520
And find out who drove him
to the clinic.

737
00:57:10,109 --> 00:57:11,480
lt's for you, sir.

738
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,342
He just died.

739
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,622
That doesn't change
the terms of your statement.

740
00:57:31,515 --> 00:57:34,602
Simply replace
''assault and battery''

741
00:57:35,197 --> 00:57:37,250
with ''manslaughter.''

742
00:57:53,247 --> 00:57:54,675
Don't bother, Shoula.

743
00:57:58,272 --> 00:57:59,788
l'll wait for you downstairs.

744
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:32,592
Who are you?

745
01:00:32,928 --> 01:00:35,679
l admired your husband.
l'm a reporter.

746
01:00:36,227 --> 01:00:37,060
No photos!

747
01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:41,136
Just a few questions.
The public...

748
01:00:41,665 --> 01:00:43,745
the people
have the right to know.

749
01:00:49,117 --> 01:00:52,876
Why do you think
it wasn't an accident?

750
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:58,016
There was a death threat yesterday.
You knew about it?

751
01:00:59,675 --> 01:01:01,334
You expected it, didn't you?

752
01:01:01,987 --> 01:01:04,767
You said,
''So they finally got him.''

753
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:10,254
What did l say?

754
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:13,572
You told the hospital director,

755
01:01:14,109 --> 01:01:17,139
''So they finally got him.''
Who are ''they''?

756
01:01:18,434 --> 01:01:19,498
Leave me alone.

757
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:23,229
The culprits have been arrested.
That's who you meant?

758
01:01:25,626 --> 01:01:27,084
Go away.

759
01:01:40,415 --> 01:01:42,545
Unmask the murderers!

760
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:46,486
They know already?

761
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,845
Yes, and it's only the start.

762
01:02:31,484 --> 01:02:33,479
Police, accomplice!

763
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:02,691
l don't understand.
The fall didn't kill him?

764
01:03:03,296 --> 01:03:04,697
Absolutely not.

765
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:08,677
The skull was fractured
by a blow to the head.

766
01:03:09,663 --> 01:03:11,323
That's our conclusion.

767
01:03:11,717 --> 01:03:14,469
The fall only caused
minor contusions.

768
01:03:15,197 --> 01:03:16,540
Are you sure?

769
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:19,782
A blow? The collision
with the three-wheeler?

770
01:03:21,441 --> 01:03:23,858
The vehicle hit his body.

771
01:03:24,645 --> 01:03:26,351
The fatal blow was to the head.

772
01:03:26,755 --> 01:03:28,912
lt could only have been made

773
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:31,876
by a club,
an iron bar or a pistol butt.

774
01:03:34,053 --> 01:03:36,440
No one said anything
about a weapon.

775
01:03:39,548 --> 01:03:41,034
Continue, Doctor.

776
01:03:41,408 --> 01:03:45,906
The skull fracture was caused
by a weapon striking from above.

777
01:03:46,682 --> 01:03:51,180
That explains
the symmetrical brain lesions

778
01:03:51,968 --> 01:03:57,367
on the area underneath
and opposite the wound.

779
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:00,120
Our autopsy revealed lesions

780
01:04:00,609 --> 01:04:02,852
and a right cerebral hemorrhage,

781
01:04:03,331 --> 01:04:06,334
whereas the fracture
occurred in the left temporal bone.

782
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,182
Had the shock
resulted from a fall

783
01:04:09,987 --> 01:04:13,382
on a hard surface,
like the street,

784
01:04:14,112 --> 01:04:16,298
such lesions wouldn't exist.

785
01:04:17,055 --> 01:04:18,878
Why weren't we told sooner?

786
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,008
- Sooner?
- Like yesterday.

787
01:04:21,409 --> 01:04:23,405
Yesterday he was still alive, sir.

788
01:04:23,837 --> 01:04:25,237
Before any autopsy.

789
01:04:25,601 --> 01:04:28,498
Other tests would have shown
the same results.

790
01:04:29,054 --> 01:04:32,391
Another theory:
He was dragged by the three-wheeler,

791
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,903
and his skull struck the curb.

792
01:04:35,326 --> 01:04:38,865
We know the collision took place
in the middle of the street.

793
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:42,508
ln any case,
no fall could cause this.

794
01:04:43,391 --> 01:04:45,022
May l make a call?

795
01:04:47,745 --> 01:04:49,117
Yago was driving.

796
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:52,896
The other man was drunk.
Too drunk for such an accurate blow.

797
01:04:53,596 --> 01:04:55,054
A demonstrator?

798
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,316
Their story doesn't hold.

799
01:04:57,662 --> 01:04:59,427
- You know them well?
- Very well.

800
01:05:00,002 --> 01:05:01,315
Are they activists?

801
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,811
Maybe.

802
01:05:03,685 --> 01:05:06,159
- Communists?
- Not if they work here.

803
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:08,336
Part of the opposition?

804
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:10,072
You can never tell.

805
01:05:12,066 --> 01:05:13,322
The general, please.

806
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:18,233
l wanted to see you, sir,
to clear up a few points.

807
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:21,177
lt all seems
clear enough to me.

808
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,461
A new fact has come to light.

809
01:05:23,872 --> 01:05:25,531
There's no air in here.

810
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,262
You saw the accident?

811
01:05:30,078 --> 01:05:31,285
How did it happen?

812
01:05:31,871 --> 01:05:33,357
At what point, exactly?

813
01:05:33,732 --> 01:05:36,541
When the three-wheeler appeared,
what happened?

814
01:05:37,789 --> 01:05:38,996
The colonel and l...

815
01:05:39,332 --> 01:05:40,541
were there.

816
01:05:40,925 --> 01:05:42,718
He came out

817
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,320
waving to the crowd,

818
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:46,458
which didn't applaud him.

819
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:49,940
He didn't see
the three-wheeler

820
01:05:50,496 --> 01:05:51,646
swerving toward him.

821
01:05:51,973 --> 01:05:52,950
lt hit him.

822
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:56,153
The colonel's men
ran after the vehicle.

823
01:05:56,701 --> 01:05:58,494
Two officers drew their guns,

824
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:01,073
but due to the crowd
they didn't open fire.

825
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:03,663
The three-wheeler
kept swerving

826
01:06:04,124 --> 01:06:05,782
and got away.

827
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,485
- And then?
- Police cleared the square

828
01:06:09,955 --> 01:06:13,742
and helped the lawyers put the victim
into a VW for the hospital.

829
01:06:14,434 --> 01:06:16,533
Still no trace of the VW driver?

830
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:19,295
Not yet, but obviously
a friend of the lawyers.

831
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,048
He helped carry
the wounded man.

832
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:26,919
When the victim was run down
could his head

833
01:06:27,621 --> 01:06:28,991
have struck the curb?

834
01:06:29,758 --> 01:06:31,783
No, it was out in the street.

835
01:06:32,224 --> 01:06:34,189
- You're sure?
- Positive.

836
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:37,690
Why these questions?
What's this new fact?

837
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:41,690
The autopsy says
he was killed by a club.

838
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:43,215
A club?

839
01:06:43,521 --> 01:06:45,881
These doctors!
Who asked them for an autopsy?

840
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:48,192
l did.
It's legal procedure.

841
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:51,970
Yesterday it was all clear!
You'll get us into deep -

842
01:07:01,598 --> 01:07:05,051
A volunteer witness.
He claims the deputy was murdered

843
01:07:05,695 --> 01:07:07,267
and has proof.

844
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:10,490
He'll be here to testify
at 2:00 p.m.

845
01:07:12,063 --> 01:07:14,363
Here we go.
It's a murder now.

846
01:07:14,853 --> 01:07:17,606
They'll be calling it a plot
if this drags on.

847
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,041
l saw him. He's drunk.

848
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,148
He stepped out
right in front of the truck.

849
01:08:05,826 --> 01:08:07,907
Did you see it?
What happened?

850
01:08:08,348 --> 01:08:10,200
l saw him slip and fall.

851
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,342
Anybody here?

852
01:08:31,806 --> 01:08:33,043
Anybody here?

853
01:09:23,173 --> 01:09:25,082
l'm the chief of police.

854
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:30,711
Sir, l was on my way to testify,
and as l was walking -

855
01:09:31,488 --> 01:09:34,154
You fell and your head
hit the sidewalk.

856
01:09:35,295 --> 01:09:37,453
You suffer from epilepsy?

857
01:09:39,812 --> 01:09:42,393
Someone hit me.
l was on my way to testify

858
01:09:42,911 --> 01:09:44,819
about the deputy's murder.

859
01:09:45,538 --> 01:09:48,769
lt was no accident.
Yago told me so himself.

860
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:51,456
l was gonna testify.

861
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:56,106
But someone hit me on the head.
Someone in a van with a club.

862
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:00,278
Probably to shut me up.
They wanted to kill me.

863
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,587
l don't know who told you
to say this, or why.

864
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:05,918
l don't want to know.

865
01:10:06,272 --> 01:10:10,377
We can forget all this.
Let's say someone put you up to it.

866
01:10:12,928 --> 01:10:14,636
You're practically family.

867
01:10:15,038 --> 01:10:16,888
Your cousin's a policeman,

868
01:10:17,311 --> 01:10:19,363
and your brother-in-law's
a civil servant.

869
01:10:19,804 --> 01:10:20,985
Forget all this.

870
01:10:21,311 --> 01:10:22,711
Sir, they're here.

871
01:10:23,104 --> 01:10:25,943
lf you need anything,
come and see me.

872
01:10:26,652 --> 01:10:28,445
l'll check in on you again.

873
01:10:34,306 --> 01:10:36,635
l'm a bachelor.
l live with my mother.

874
01:10:37,183 --> 01:10:38,420
Occupation?

875
01:10:38,755 --> 01:10:40,127
l run a varnishing shop.

876
01:10:40,482 --> 01:10:41,661
You know Yago?

877
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,011
He makes my deliveries.

878
01:10:44,893 --> 01:10:46,494
l don't know the other two.

879
01:10:46,974 --> 01:10:48,404
The murder...
- Accident!

880
01:10:50,465 --> 01:10:52,968
...was the day l phoned Yago

881
01:10:53,477 --> 01:10:54,398
about a delivery.

882
01:10:54,724 --> 01:10:58,405
Varnished coffins! l can't even make
my kamikaze payments.

883
01:10:59,078 --> 01:11:00,756
Come back this afternoon.
They're not ready.

884
01:11:01,149 --> 01:11:02,300
l'm busy later.

885
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:04,870
- Tonight, then.
- l'm busy then too.

886
01:11:06,309 --> 01:11:09,627
l'm about to make the biggest mistake
of my life. A murder.

887
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,531
Next day l heard
he'd killed the deputy.

888
01:11:14,115 --> 01:11:15,601
Yago told you all that?

889
01:11:15,966 --> 01:11:17,510
When did you join the parrty?

890
01:11:17,885 --> 01:11:21,203
l've never belonged to any parrty.
l only like soccer.

891
01:11:22,373 --> 01:11:24,674
What's with you all?
The general says l'm epileptic -

892
01:11:25,153 --> 01:11:25,940
General?

893
01:11:26,209 --> 01:11:28,788
The chief of police.
Calls it a nervous disorder.

894
01:11:29,316 --> 01:11:31,866
- He was here?
- Just before you came.

895
01:11:32,606 --> 01:11:36,451
But l'm no epileptic,
and l don't belong to any party.

896
01:11:38,206 --> 01:11:39,606
Go on about Yago.

897
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,580
That's all.
He left, saying to my helper...

898
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:45,179
He's the lucky one.

899
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:48,632
When can you deliver these?

900
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,295
l tried to set him straight,
but he does as he pleases.

901
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:55,652
Who told you
to call the magistrate?

902
01:11:56,285 --> 01:11:59,095
No one. l saw Yago's picture
in all the papers.

903
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:02,442
A thug on the front page,
like a minister.

904
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:05,625
- And why not you, right?
- So you made up this story.

905
01:12:06,115 --> 01:12:08,301
No, someone advised you.

906
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:10,565
No.
Even Ma was against it.

907
01:12:10,976 --> 01:12:12,435
She said to keep quiet.

908
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,736
- Come and eat.
- He killed a man.

909
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:17,220
- What man?
- A deputy.

910
01:12:17,661 --> 01:12:20,021
- In the government?
- No, the opposition.

911
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,956
He did right.
What's it to you?

912
01:12:23,453 --> 01:12:25,132
He got his picture in the paper.

913
01:12:26,532 --> 01:12:29,055
Eat.
Let them kill each other.

914
01:12:29,698 --> 01:12:30,560
Not hungry.

915
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:32,824
Later she came with my sister.

916
01:12:33,245 --> 01:12:35,067
You trying to be a hero?

917
01:12:35,615 --> 01:12:37,801
Just doing my civic duty.
Take a walk!

918
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,487
Your civic duty's
to your family.

919
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:44,188
l've done enough.
Now some other idiot buys you dresses.

920
01:12:44,803 --> 01:12:47,354
My husband's no idiot.
And that's my business!

921
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,202
Don't butt in, Mama.
Think you'll earn a medal?

922
01:12:51,526 --> 01:12:52,926
l came anyway.

923
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:55,640
Or l would've
if they hadn't clobbered me.

924
01:12:56,128 --> 01:12:57,643
You didn't fall?

925
01:12:58,017 --> 01:13:01,614
l'd have to be an acrobat
to land on my head.

926
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:05,432
l'll come by tomorrow
if you still want to testify.

927
01:13:06,017 --> 01:13:07,983
Sure do. l'm not nuts.

928
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:12,508
Your first prosecution witness.
They lost no time.

929
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:15,836
Tomorrow you'll have 10,
the next day 15.

930
01:13:16,384 --> 01:13:19,078
''Yago this, Yago that...''
Nonsense!

931
01:13:19,616 --> 01:13:21,697
Vague statements
of no legal value

932
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,669
that will create unrest.

933
01:13:25,187 --> 01:13:27,431
They sent him
and made up the attack

934
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:29,609
to turn a witness
into a martyr.

935
01:13:30,021 --> 01:13:31,681
Here he's hospitalized

936
01:13:32,063 --> 01:13:33,665
but able to talk.

937
01:13:34,049 --> 01:13:36,859
You admit l was attacked.
See? l didn't fall.

938
01:13:37,405 --> 01:13:39,315
You know what perjury
can get you?

939
01:13:39,746 --> 01:13:41,233
lt's not perjury!

940
01:13:42,019 --> 01:13:44,042
Maybe
l should've stayed home.

941
01:13:46,114 --> 01:13:47,457
l warned you.

942
01:13:48,253 --> 01:13:51,341
Why get involved?
Aren't you happy at home?

943
01:13:54,784 --> 01:13:56,039
Eat.

944
01:13:57,948 --> 01:14:00,980
What if you say you slipped
on an orange peel?

945
01:14:01,574 --> 01:14:02,974
l didn't slip.

946
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:05,937
You're so pigheaded.
Listen to me for once.

947
01:14:06,464 --> 01:14:09,831
Just this once.
The first and last time.

948
01:14:10,463 --> 01:14:13,159
- Like always.
- Really the last time.

949
01:14:13,764 --> 01:14:15,845
Say you slipped.

950
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,366
Your brother-in-law will be okay.
You won't risk prison.

951
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,947
l'll send others to prison.

952
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,209
No risk. l got 'em.

953
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,607
So much for Yago
and his picture.

954
01:14:26,556 --> 01:14:28,915
Who sent you, Ma?
The cops or Sis?

955
01:14:30,144 --> 01:14:33,261
Yes, it was me.
You want to destroy my home?

956
01:14:33,856 --> 01:14:34,978
Leave us, Mama.

957
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,674
Leave us, l said.

958
01:14:40,031 --> 01:14:41,969
- Don't fight.
- Out!

959
01:14:44,701 --> 01:14:46,974
You hate me
for succeeding in life.

960
01:14:47,454 --> 01:14:49,420
You and your husband
hate me.

961
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:52,978
Never mind him.
You've caused him enough trouble!

962
01:14:53,919 --> 01:14:56,133
You want to destroy my life.

963
01:14:57,764 --> 01:15:00,431
When Papa died,
l hoped you'd take his place.

964
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,568
l needed security.

965
01:15:02,943 --> 01:15:06,568
You ignored me.
You never took me anywhere.

966
01:15:07,325 --> 01:15:10,356
You preferred soccer
and thugs like Yago.

967
01:15:10,942 --> 01:15:14,873
See where it's got you!
Prison, maybe, for perjury.

968
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,556
We'll be called accomplices.
My husband will be fired.

969
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,606
Come here. Listen.

970
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,494
You hear a guy's gonna be killed.
You don't believe it.

971
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:31,110
Then you hear he's dead.
Wouldn't you tell the cops?

972
01:15:31,686 --> 01:15:34,467
That's all l did
to help them.

973
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:38,648
- Help who?
- To help the law find the killer.

974
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:41,486
You're helping the others.

975
01:15:43,588 --> 01:15:44,843
What do you want?

976
01:15:46,013 --> 01:15:47,528
Your mother sent me.

977
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:49,706
l'm a journalist.

978
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,791
l'll tell you what happened,
because you print a lot of nonsense.

979
01:15:54,463 --> 01:15:57,186
- Were you there?
- No, but he wasn't struck.

980
01:15:57,733 --> 01:16:00,907
He slipped or passed out,

981
01:16:01,502 --> 01:16:04,197
or leftists hit him
to stir up trouble.

982
01:16:04,734 --> 01:16:05,913
That's what the police say.

983
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:09,136
They say he's crazy
but can't prove it. Can you?

984
01:16:10,048 --> 01:16:12,176
- No, l can't.
- Then why try?

985
01:16:13,471 --> 01:16:14,843
l never said that.

986
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:17,384
On the contrary,
he's mule-headed.

987
01:16:18,276 --> 01:16:19,733
There's no changing his mind.

988
01:16:20,223 --> 01:16:23,541
lf he doesn't change it,
the investigation continues.

989
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,384
What if he is crazy
and had epilepsy as a kid?

990
01:16:29,094 --> 01:16:31,280
Tell him
how you and your husband

991
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:34,358
joined the right-wingers
to get yourselves jobs.

992
01:16:35,394 --> 01:16:37,812
lt's true!
l joined them!

993
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:43,087
Don't wake the policeman.

994
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:46,769
She woke him up.
- He was asleep?

995
01:16:48,323 --> 01:16:49,693
Taking pictures?

996
01:16:51,266 --> 01:16:52,639
For the press, like Yago?

997
01:16:53,953 --> 01:16:55,190
lt looks ugly.

998
01:16:55,525 --> 01:16:58,786
People have to see you
and know they attacked you

999
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:02,362
to keep you from saying
something important. See?

1000
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,397
They'll attack me again.

1001
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,744
They won't dare,
once you're famous.

1002
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:10,899
But the papers
have to talk about you.

1003
01:17:11,358 --> 01:17:14,677
Tell me who was here:
your sister, mother, the magistrate.

1004
01:17:15,301 --> 01:17:17,429
The general.
He can't stand me.

1005
01:17:17,956 --> 01:17:20,288
l wanted to help
and got a cold shoulder.

1006
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,704
They asked if l was a Commie.

1007
01:17:23,231 --> 01:17:26,070
- Are you?
- No. Say l only care about soccer.

1008
01:17:26,626 --> 01:17:29,350
We'll make the front page
for a week.

1009
01:17:41,405 --> 01:17:42,642
Excuse me.

1010
01:17:44,513 --> 01:17:45,300
Who was it?

1011
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:47,582
l know him.

1012
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:10,475
So you're a cardiac case?

1013
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:14,867
lt's an old fracture.

1014
01:18:18,435 --> 01:18:19,950
Name and occupation?

1015
01:18:23,814 --> 01:18:25,301
Any convictions?

1016
01:18:27,622 --> 01:18:30,316
- Yes, four.
- Four.

1017
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:32,158
Yes, four.

1018
01:18:32,484 --> 01:18:36,139
lllegal possession of a weapon,
abuse and slander, theft...

1019
01:18:37,731 --> 01:18:38,881
and rape.

1020
01:18:39,975 --> 01:18:41,212
Rape?

1021
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:45,959
lt wasn't really.
l was a boy scout camp counselor.

1022
01:18:48,606 --> 01:18:50,121
Why were you in the hospital?

1023
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:54,973
Security confined him there.
My client has a weak heart.

1024
01:18:55,808 --> 01:18:58,676
Here's the police MD's certificate.
- l've seen it.

1025
01:19:00,325 --> 01:19:02,089
But why the cast

1026
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:04,612
and this clublike cane?

1027
01:19:05,025 --> 01:19:07,183
On account
of this old fracture.

1028
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,261
l was broke
when it happened.

1029
01:19:11,268 --> 01:19:14,835
l needed X rays, a cast and 10 days
in bed. Two days off work

1030
01:19:15,488 --> 01:19:16,667
and l'd starrve.

1031
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,275
lt was a rich man's fracture.

1032
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:24,099
A rich man catches a cold...
and plop!

1033
01:19:24,896 --> 01:19:25,846
A week in bed.

1034
01:19:26,142 --> 01:19:29,259
We poor get a fracture,
we still gotta work or we die.

1035
01:19:29,854 --> 01:19:33,029
l was in the hospital already,
so l had it taken care of.

1036
01:19:33,633 --> 01:19:35,005
And the night of the accident?

1037
01:19:36,097 --> 01:19:38,793
l was drinking with Yago till 10:00
at the Chinaman's.

1038
01:19:39,329 --> 01:19:40,701
You see Yago often?

1039
01:19:41,824 --> 01:19:44,211
Sure.
We're friends and cousins.

1040
01:19:45,409 --> 01:19:46,359
He'd been drinking too?

1041
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,786
A lot.
Yago drinks a lot.

1042
01:19:51,365 --> 01:19:54,204
The Chinaman even told him
not to drive home.

1043
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:57,704
l got in back and fell asleep.

1044
01:19:58,214 --> 01:20:00,543
The collision
and the shouting woke me.

1045
01:20:01,695 --> 01:20:04,812
l thought we were in a ditch,
but we kept going.

1046
01:20:05,856 --> 01:20:09,539
Then this guy leaps
onto the truck bed,

1047
01:20:10,211 --> 01:20:12,206
lithe and ferocious
as a tiger.

1048
01:20:12,647 --> 01:20:15,849
He grabs me... and whoosh!
Out l go into the street.

1049
01:20:16,454 --> 01:20:18,084
How did he leap?

1050
01:20:18,469 --> 01:20:20,147
- Like a tiger.
- Before that.

1051
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:25,133
Lithe and ferocious
as a tiger.

1052
01:20:27,492 --> 01:20:29,679
Yago used
the same exact phrase.

1053
01:20:30,821 --> 01:20:32,556
As the driver
he couldn't have seen him.

1054
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:34,619
A mere coincidence
Your Honor.

1055
01:20:35,012 --> 01:20:38,435
They haven't met since the accident.
They've had no contact.

1056
01:20:39,077 --> 01:20:40,506
The police can confirm.

1057
01:20:42,694 --> 01:20:43,901
Continue.

1058
01:20:44,228 --> 01:20:48,495
There l was in the street, cars all
around me. l coulda got run over.

1059
01:20:49,253 --> 01:20:51,612
- And then?
- l went home.

1060
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:54,471
When l read the papers
the next day,

1061
01:20:54,912 --> 01:20:57,299
l went to the police,
who put me in the hospital.

1062
01:20:57,799 --> 01:21:01,309
There he got lost in the halls
Iooking for his room

1063
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:04,340
and met that reporter
quite by chance.

1064
01:21:06,209 --> 01:21:08,627
That concurs
with other testimony.

1065
01:21:09,662 --> 01:21:12,634
But something you said
makes me wonder.

1066
01:21:13,795 --> 01:21:15,790
lt changes the direction
of my investigation.

1067
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:18,486
You're a Communist.

1068
01:21:18,783 --> 01:21:19,674
Me?

1069
01:21:19,972 --> 01:21:21,881
You and Yago.
You're friends.

1070
01:21:22,302 --> 01:21:25,390
lt was something
you let slip out.

1071
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:28,719
''A rich man catches a cold...

1072
01:21:29,121 --> 01:21:31,902
we poor still have
to work or we die.''

1073
01:21:32,449 --> 01:21:34,529
Then you caught yourself
and stopped.

1074
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,324
l hate Communists!

1075
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:38,644
Not words.
l want proof!

1076
01:21:39,076 --> 01:21:41,128
Only a Communist
would say that.

1077
01:21:41,569 --> 01:21:44,265
l belong to
an anti-Communist group!

1078
01:21:44,801 --> 01:21:45,866
- And Yago?
- Yago too.

1079
01:21:46,183 --> 01:21:46,912
Which one?

1080
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:51,496
CROC! Christian Royalist
Organization against Communism.

1081
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,665
You've unleashed a storm.

1082
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:08,547
Vago's charged with collusion.
Collusion means premeditation.

1083
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:12,661
The magistrate believed you.
He started digging...

1084
01:22:14,273 --> 01:22:16,997
and found that Vago and Yago
belong to a secret group.

1085
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:20,382
- Secret group?
- Yes, CROC.

1086
01:22:20,928 --> 01:22:22,780
Everybody knows 'em.

1087
01:22:23,201 --> 01:22:25,723
The cops use 'em
to keep order during state visits.

1088
01:22:27,843 --> 01:22:29,809
You're safe.
You're famous now.

1089
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,416
But in a year l'll be forgotten.

1090
01:22:33,828 --> 01:22:35,257
No one can touch you now.

1091
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:40,262
Know anyone who could point out
these CROC people to me?

1092
01:22:41,376 --> 01:22:42,353
l'd pay.

1093
01:22:43,264 --> 01:22:44,098
They did this.

1094
01:22:44,386 --> 01:22:46,046
All the more reason
to expose them.

1095
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,982
Well?

1096
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,661
Know anyone?

1097
01:22:50,247 --> 01:22:51,484
Sure do.

1098
01:22:52,712 --> 01:22:54,678
But don't say l told you.

1099
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:56,231
lt's Dumas...

1100
01:22:56,998 --> 01:22:58,706
alias ''The Russian,''
born in Odessa.

1101
01:22:59,751 --> 01:23:03,347
CROC's gotta hold on him
'cause of trouble with his brother.

1102
01:23:04,517 --> 01:23:07,068
He wants to work in Germany
but has no passport.

1103
01:23:08,161 --> 01:23:10,434
So if you can fix that...

1104
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:17,733
A passport? No problem.
l can get one through my paper.

1105
01:23:19,526 --> 01:23:21,185
The photos?
- Here.

1106
01:23:29,443 --> 01:23:31,716
l've kept my word.

1107
01:23:32,838 --> 01:23:34,208
Now you keep yours.

1108
01:23:35,781 --> 01:23:37,968
- Don't like it?
- Sure.

1109
01:23:40,452 --> 01:23:42,505
So... those questions?

1110
01:23:43,492 --> 01:23:45,650
Does CROC meet regularly?

1111
01:23:48,547 --> 01:23:49,784
Where?

1112
01:23:50,657 --> 01:23:53,600
At some fat guy's place
on the edge of town.

1113
01:23:54,435 --> 01:23:56,008
Are there many of you?

1114
01:23:56,516 --> 01:23:57,753
Sometimes.

1115
01:23:59,038 --> 01:24:01,790
- What goes on?
- The chief talks patriotism...

1116
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:05,014
Religion, monarchy...

1117
01:24:05,502 --> 01:24:08,083
the twin pillars
of our eternal homeland

1118
01:24:09,223 --> 01:24:12,034
and Western
Christian civilization.

1119
01:24:12,867 --> 01:24:15,984
lf you don't listen,
you don't work.

1120
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:17,951
What else?

1121
01:24:18,277 --> 01:24:21,423
ln Russia a worker can't, strike
or believe in God

1122
01:24:22,017 --> 01:24:24,011
or have his own
house and garden.

1123
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:26,995
lndividuals are crushed
by a totalitarian regime.

1124
01:24:27,809 --> 01:24:30,707
- You all believe that?
- l even read it in the papers.

1125
01:24:31,263 --> 01:24:33,229
The state owns everything.

1126
01:24:34,178 --> 01:24:36,278
Yago attended the meetings?

1127
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:39,530
Always.
He also talked about capitalists.

1128
01:24:40,191 --> 01:24:42,272
No more capitalists!
No more workers!

1129
01:24:42,723 --> 01:24:44,353
No more Left or Right!

1130
01:24:44,737 --> 01:24:47,067
A people united, one nation,
is what we need!

1131
01:24:47,557 --> 01:24:49,014
That calls for a clean sweep.

1132
01:24:49,378 --> 01:24:51,900
Start with intellectual scum!

1133
01:24:52,418 --> 01:24:53,877
The bookstore down the street!

1134
01:24:54,309 --> 01:24:58,125
He'd talk about parliamentary farce,
political youth movements.

1135
01:24:58,815 --> 01:25:00,609
Really? What'd he say?

1136
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:03,113
Unite the young people...

1137
01:25:03,429 --> 01:25:05,615
...and give them a common ideal.

1138
01:25:06,085 --> 01:25:09,087
Abroad they're told,
''Make love, not war.''

1139
01:25:09,663 --> 01:25:11,369
We say, ''Make war!

1140
01:25:11,782 --> 01:25:15,042
Make war on corruption,
on liberalism,

1141
01:25:15,647 --> 01:25:18,064
and on indiscriminate liberties!''

1142
01:25:19,425 --> 01:25:21,583
l say fine, but l don't care.

1143
01:25:22,054 --> 01:25:22,868
And Yago?

1144
01:25:23,137 --> 01:25:26,589
He agrees, but he only wants
to pay off his kamikaze.

1145
01:25:27,232 --> 01:25:29,255
Now he can pay it off easily.

1146
01:25:30,339 --> 01:25:31,913
That's why he killed the deputy?

1147
01:25:32,287 --> 01:25:34,166
You said no accusations.

1148
01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:36,736
No, it's on me.

1149
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:38,348
No way.

1150
01:25:38,855 --> 01:25:41,637
At least point them out
for some photos.

1151
01:25:42,212 --> 01:25:43,842
That what you wanted?

1152
01:25:45,732 --> 01:25:47,392
The three guys
on the three-wheeler.

1153
01:25:49,856 --> 01:25:51,986
The butcher.
He was in on it.

1154
01:25:53,797 --> 01:25:56,636
The fat guy.
He owns the bar where we meet.

1155
01:25:58,151 --> 01:25:59,332
The barber.

1156
01:26:00,454 --> 01:26:03,686
The mechanic
and the two in black.

1157
01:26:05,028 --> 01:26:07,416
- In the khaki jacket.
- Him?

1158
01:26:07,905 --> 01:26:10,743
An ex-boxer
who lived in the U.S. for a while.

1159
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,123
ln the garden, the chief...

1160
01:26:13,534 --> 01:26:15,722
an officer
during the German occupation.

1161
01:26:16,192 --> 01:26:20,602
The fig seller, a loudmouth.
Goes in for rough stuff.

1162
01:26:33,952 --> 01:26:35,296
Some figs, please.

1163
01:26:44,195 --> 01:26:47,370
The guy sitting over there.
Sells his own blood.

1164
01:26:48,675 --> 01:26:50,727
ln emergencies
he jacks up the price.

1165
01:26:51,168 --> 01:26:54,226
That guy got rich
selling one eye to an American.

1166
01:26:54,821 --> 01:26:57,094
He doesn't attend
meetings anymore.

1167
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:59,636
His sight's bad,
so he sells his blood.

1168
01:27:01,919 --> 01:27:02,983
Not him?

1169
01:27:03,999 --> 01:27:04,920
Them?

1170
01:27:06,531 --> 01:27:07,510
Him?

1171
01:27:13,188 --> 01:27:15,183
lt looks like... It's him.

1172
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,532
He beat me twice.

1173
01:27:17,887 --> 01:27:19,430
ln the street
and in the ambulance.

1174
01:27:19,815 --> 01:27:21,694
Write that in the margin.

1175
01:27:22,212 --> 01:27:24,763
You have to publish it
in our paper.

1176
01:27:25,827 --> 01:27:27,457
Sign your name.

1177
01:27:29,663 --> 01:27:30,844
Publish it.

1178
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:33,836
Sure, but not in your paper.
In a national daily.

1179
01:27:34,372 --> 01:27:37,269
lt'll get read, and it pays.
- Money's not the point!

1180
01:27:37,826 --> 01:27:41,613
The photo runs tomorrow with my piece.
Bring the magistrate here.

1181
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:46,217
Want do you want out of this?
Satisfaction or impact?

1182
01:27:46,754 --> 01:27:49,477
ln a local opposition paper,
no one will see it.

1183
01:27:50,025 --> 01:27:52,354
ln mine
it's sensational news.

1184
01:27:55,175 --> 01:27:56,631
So you recognized me?

1185
01:27:56,996 --> 01:27:59,077
l'm a working man.
You dishonored me

1186
01:27:59,518 --> 01:28:02,099
made me out to be a gangster.

1187
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:06,443
l wasn't at that demonstration.
l'm not political.

1188
01:28:07,143 --> 01:28:08,907
Deputies are all swine.

1189
01:28:09,321 --> 01:28:10,692
Let go of him.

1190
01:28:12,485 --> 01:28:13,856
Leave the room.

1191
01:28:18,498 --> 01:28:20,158
l'm the magistrate.

1192
01:28:22,372 --> 01:28:23,188
Let's hear it.

1193
01:28:23,456 --> 01:28:25,701
My photo on the front page.

1194
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,419
Mr. Pirou says l hit him
at the demonstration.

1195
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,469
l wasn't there.
l got witnesses.

1196
01:28:34,054 --> 01:28:36,556
Politics is full of swine.

1197
01:28:37,536 --> 01:28:39,357
l was at the market
with my figs.

1198
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:42,283
Your picture
was in what paper?

1199
01:28:43,779 --> 01:28:45,351
l forget.

1200
01:28:46,626 --> 01:28:48,680
lt arrives from the capital
at 10:00 a.m.

1201
01:28:50,463 --> 01:28:52,880
l can't read... not very well.

1202
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:58,605
The newsstand guy
read it to me.

1203
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:02,489
Everyone at the market
thinks l'm a hood.

1204
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,807
l came to have it out with him
man to man.

1205
01:29:06,335 --> 01:29:08,128
A paper from the capital?

1206
01:29:08,799 --> 01:29:11,831
- Still recognize me?
- l asked which paper!

1207
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:18,305
The paper that gets in
from the capital at 10:00.

1208
01:29:18,851 --> 01:29:22,534
lt didn't get in this morning.
The mail plane was grounded.

1209
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:26,054
Who told you to say all this?

1210
01:29:41,312 --> 01:29:42,319
Okay...

1211
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:45,397
so l hit him.

1212
01:29:45,992 --> 01:29:47,699
But it wasn't my idea.

1213
01:29:49,089 --> 01:29:52,033
Somebody made me do it.
The same person who warned me.

1214
01:29:52,609 --> 01:29:54,124
What's his name?

1215
01:29:56,387 --> 01:29:59,475
l can't tell you.
Somebody high up.

1216
01:30:01,384 --> 01:30:04,166
Somebody big.
l can't tell you.

1217
01:30:05,345 --> 01:30:06,803
He came to warn me.

1218
01:30:07,752 --> 01:30:11,377
Barone, your picture's
in the paper.

1219
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,132
Mine?

1220
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,758
The papers arrive at 10:00,
so at 10:45, no earlier,

1221
01:30:17,381 --> 01:30:19,088
you rush down to see Pirou
in the hospital.

1222
01:30:19,491 --> 01:30:21,793
Raise hell.
Claim you're innocent.

1223
01:30:22,273 --> 01:30:24,008
Yell. Make a stink.

1224
01:30:24,612 --> 01:30:27,757
There'll be reporters around.
Repeat what you have to do.

1225
01:30:28,353 --> 01:30:30,088
l run to the hospital...

1226
01:30:30,501 --> 01:30:31,815
Get lost.

1227
01:30:32,295 --> 01:30:33,187
...to see Deputy Pirou.

1228
01:30:33,705 --> 01:30:35,439
Tell us his name.

1229
01:30:35,842 --> 01:30:37,330
l can't. He's too big.

1230
01:30:37,704 --> 01:30:39,074
Enough.

1231
01:30:39,784 --> 01:30:41,270
Come with me, please.

1232
01:30:45,989 --> 01:30:47,448
l'm innocent.

1233
01:30:47,907 --> 01:30:49,481
l only wanted to testify.

1234
01:30:50,277 --> 01:30:52,156
lt's all an opposition scheme.

1235
01:30:52,837 --> 01:30:55,647
This important man -
l'm not asking his name.

1236
01:30:56,712 --> 01:30:57,748
He helped you?

1237
01:30:58,054 --> 01:31:00,576
Yes, in my work
and with my birds.

1238
01:31:01,094 --> 01:31:04,853
Their singing wakes the neighbors.
l was gonna have to move.

1239
01:31:05,545 --> 01:31:07,203
But birds are nice.

1240
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,725
You should come by
to see them.

1241
01:31:10,723 --> 01:31:12,939
He helped me out
in my work too.

1242
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,074
My market permit and all that.

1243
01:31:16,583 --> 01:31:19,642
The day of the accident,
he came for you?

1244
01:31:20,736 --> 01:31:24,361
Yes. Jimmy the Boxer said,
''The director's downstairs.''

1245
01:31:25,733 --> 01:31:26,911
He was in his car.

1246
01:31:27,238 --> 01:31:28,475
Getin.

1247
01:31:33,346 --> 01:31:34,834
You know it's tonight?

1248
01:31:35,303 --> 01:31:36,617
But l can't.

1249
01:31:36,963 --> 01:31:38,478
l had a shipment coming in.

1250
01:31:38,851 --> 01:31:41,355
Figs need special care.

1251
01:31:42,151 --> 01:31:45,518
You need a stand
to sell them.

1252
01:31:46,151 --> 01:31:46,985
l got one.

1253
01:31:47,273 --> 01:31:48,817
And a permit.

1254
01:31:49,602 --> 01:31:52,921
- l got one.
- Sure, but for how much longer?

1255
01:31:54,053 --> 01:31:56,527
- Six months.
- And who renews your permits?

1256
01:31:58,407 --> 01:31:59,864
He issues the permits?

1257
01:32:00,228 --> 01:32:01,149
Yeah.

1258
01:32:02,243 --> 01:32:03,644
Then he dropped us off.

1259
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,288
Do a good job tonight.
l'm counting on you.

1260
01:32:07,872 --> 01:32:09,609
You'll get
your permanent permit,

1261
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:13,108
and maybe a new house
just for you and your birds.

1262
01:32:13,703 --> 01:32:14,940
Go on.

1263
01:32:15,976 --> 01:32:18,787
l said, ''Yes, Colonel.
We'll do our best.''

1264
01:32:20,388 --> 01:32:21,789
The head of security.

1265
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,719
Sit down.
We'll go over it calmly.

1266
01:32:32,644 --> 01:32:34,860
Can l have my assistant?

1267
01:32:36,424 --> 01:32:39,233
Do you realize
that prolonging the investigation

1268
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:42,752
gives the opposition
fuel for subversive action?

1269
01:32:43,492 --> 01:32:44,862
Are you on their side?

1270
01:32:45,218 --> 01:32:48,479
lt's a new case
in a different light.

1271
01:32:49,448 --> 01:32:52,899
Some points are murky, but the case
is clear. Nothing's changed.

1272
01:32:53,733 --> 01:32:54,799
On the contrary.

1273
01:32:55,105 --> 01:32:57,714
We began with an accident
and two drunks.

1274
01:32:58,242 --> 01:32:59,757
Some ice, dear.

1275
01:33:01,474 --> 01:33:04,620
Their testimony concurs
in every detail.

1276
01:33:05,224 --> 01:33:07,045
Backed up by the Chinaman.

1277
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:12,281
Next day, the autopsy reveals death
caused by a clubbing.

1278
01:33:12,991 --> 01:33:14,622
Which a counter autopsy
will refute,

1279
01:33:15,016 --> 01:33:18,803
and an expert will annul
the previous ones, etc.

1280
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:20,673
Before l have time

1281
01:33:20,999 --> 01:33:22,399
to examine this new theory,

1282
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:25,930
a volunteer witness
says it was a murder attempt.

1283
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:28,662
Based on vague talk.

1284
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:33,428
On his way to see me,
the witness is clubbed.

1285
01:33:34,244 --> 01:33:35,529
He's still in the hospital.

1286
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:36,737
What are you hinting at?

1287
01:33:37,025 --> 01:33:39,211
Nothing, sir.
l'm only stating facts.

1288
01:33:41,188 --> 01:33:42,645
Enter the reporter.

1289
01:33:43,009 --> 01:33:45,848
His motives are anything but political.
That's important.

1290
01:33:46,404 --> 01:33:51,209
Then l discover that
Yago and Vago belong to CROC,

1291
01:33:52,034 --> 01:33:53,798
the Christian Royalists -

1292
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:55,726
- l know them.
- You know them.

1293
01:33:56,388 --> 01:33:58,489
Along with the second
deputy's assailant

1294
01:33:58,948 --> 01:34:01,366
and most of those
at the demonstration.

1295
01:34:01,864 --> 01:34:05,039
lt seems the police
know them and use them

1296
01:34:05,633 --> 01:34:08,358
to maintain order
during state visits.

1297
01:34:08,903 --> 01:34:10,390
That remains to be proven.

1298
01:34:10,851 --> 01:34:13,239
As does the head of security

1299
01:34:13,728 --> 01:34:16,231
driving this man
to the demonstration.

1300
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:17,688
That's outrageous!

1301
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,710
He would never deal
with such an individual.

1302
01:34:21,256 --> 01:34:24,200
Not openly.
No one would believe it.

1303
01:34:26,214 --> 01:34:27,729
My conclusion is this:

1304
01:34:28,833 --> 01:34:32,257
lt would be simple
as a drunk driving case,

1305
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:34,578
but that's no longer possible.

1306
01:34:34,981 --> 01:34:39,584
However, if we accept it as
the premeditated act of a group

1307
01:34:40,389 --> 01:34:42,997
abetted or simply tolerated
by the police,

1308
01:34:43,526 --> 01:34:45,856
it all becomes clear
and fits together.

1309
01:34:47,237 --> 01:34:50,775
This is very serious.
l must phone the minister.

1310
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:54,650
l favor the accident theory.

1311
01:34:55,715 --> 01:34:59,561
Premeditated by two fanatics.
Drunk, to boot.

1312
01:35:02,026 --> 01:35:03,454
Right, you don't smoke.

1313
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,810
You must settle this quickly.

1314
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:12,335
The city, the country, even the world
are watching and waiting.

1315
01:35:13,284 --> 01:35:15,365
Our country's honor is at stake.

1316
01:35:17,187 --> 01:35:18,982
Forget about these lowlifes.

1317
01:35:19,624 --> 01:35:21,533
Your future lies before you.

1318
01:35:21,954 --> 01:35:24,084
This case can take you very far

1319
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:26,999
or break your career.

1320
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:30,336
Take it
from someone who knows.

1321
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:36,061
My organization is recognized
by the authorities.

1322
01:35:36,579 --> 01:35:40,655
We are honest citizens
healthy elements of socieiy,

1323
01:35:41,576 --> 01:35:44,414
antibodies in the fight
against all infection.

1324
01:35:44,961 --> 01:35:47,235
Our goal is the defense

1325
01:35:47,714 --> 01:35:51,281
of Western civilization.
But it's a moral struggle.

1326
01:35:52,069 --> 01:35:56,508
None of our members
were at that demonstration.

1327
01:35:57,861 --> 01:35:59,318
Where were you that night?

1328
01:36:00,134 --> 01:36:03,165
l was with the treasurer
of the Dockers' Union.

1329
01:36:05,063 --> 01:36:06,243
Alibi confirmed.

1330
01:36:07,873 --> 01:36:10,933
My brother and l were
playing cards with our dentist.

1331
01:36:11,873 --> 01:36:12,658
Alibi confirmed.

1332
01:36:12,936 --> 01:36:16,198
l'm a baker.
l sleep till midnight at my shop.

1333
01:36:16,965 --> 01:36:18,116
Alibi confirmed.

1334
01:36:18,566 --> 01:36:20,360
l was at the Chinaman's.

1335
01:36:21,376 --> 01:36:22,162
Alibi confirmed.

1336
01:36:22,441 --> 01:36:23,391
At the Chinaman's.

1337
01:36:24,033 --> 01:36:24,848
Alibi confirmed.

1338
01:36:25,184 --> 01:36:28,809
l was with the brothers
at the dentist's.

1339
01:36:29,673 --> 01:36:30,794
Alibi confirmed.

1340
01:36:31,428 --> 01:36:34,007
That's not you
at the demonstration?

1341
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:36,308
lt does look like me.

1342
01:36:38,121 --> 01:36:39,781
lndicted for perjury...

1343
01:36:40,769 --> 01:36:43,185
along with those
who confirmed his alibi.

1344
01:36:43,684 --> 01:36:45,342
Plus obstructing justice.

1345
01:36:46,408 --> 01:36:47,778
Take him away.

1346
01:36:50,407 --> 01:36:52,823
Witness 27 died last night
of a heart attack.

1347
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:55,365
He owned
the CROC meeting hall.

1348
01:36:55,815 --> 01:36:57,360
Before, you stated

1349
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:59,143
Yago hit you with a club

1350
01:36:59,748 --> 01:37:01,291
similar to a police nightstick.

1351
01:37:01,705 --> 01:37:03,949
Do you maintain that?
- Yes, Your Honor.

1352
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:07,055
The prosecutor says
he phoned you that morning

1353
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:10,374
about death threats
against the deputy.

1354
01:37:11,045 --> 01:37:11,965
Your superiors say

1355
01:37:12,264 --> 01:37:13,693
they never got his message.

1356
01:37:14,057 --> 01:37:15,715
True, l forgot to tell them.

1357
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,222
That's a serious error.

1358
01:37:18,084 --> 01:37:20,837
l'll answer to my superiors,
not you,

1359
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:22,755
Your Honor.

1360
01:37:24,711 --> 01:37:28,529
That morning, Counselor,
you were warned of death threats

1361
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:31,243
against the head
of your movement.

1362
01:37:32,289 --> 01:37:34,197
Who informed you
about them?

1363
01:37:34,888 --> 01:37:37,803
A colleague's wife.
She can't give us the name.

1364
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:40,056
She'll have to.

1365
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:42,522
The man says l can tell you.

1366
01:37:43,433 --> 01:37:44,976
He's out in the hall.

1367
01:37:45,351 --> 01:37:46,721
Bring him in.

1368
01:37:48,131 --> 01:37:49,646
His name's Coste.

1369
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:53,559
The day of the murder...
- The incident.

1370
01:37:54,692 --> 01:37:56,456
...he came to my office

1371
01:37:56,868 --> 01:37:59,372
to tell me of a conversation
he'd overheard.

1372
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:02,096
But he can tell you better.

1373
01:38:02,882 --> 01:38:06,305
l don't want to be in the papers.
l don't want to be known.

1374
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:08,771
Why not?
Isn't your story true?

1375
01:38:09,192 --> 01:38:11,378
Yes, but l don't want
any trouble.

1376
01:38:12,069 --> 01:38:13,469
Come see me if you need help.

1377
01:38:15,369 --> 01:38:17,248
Wait in the hall, please.

1378
01:38:20,835 --> 01:38:22,236
Name and occupation?

1379
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:26,024
llya Coste, deliveryman.

1380
01:38:27,462 --> 01:38:28,978
On the day of the murder -

1381
01:38:29,352 --> 01:38:32,612
The incident.
There's no proof of murder yet.

1382
01:38:34,472 --> 01:38:37,647
The day of the incident,
it rained a bit...

1383
01:38:38,568 --> 01:38:41,263
l work myself to death,

1384
01:38:42,212 --> 01:38:45,664
and the bank gets half
of what l earn.

1385
01:38:46,691 --> 01:38:48,398
Someone wants you.

1386
01:38:48,992 --> 01:38:49,635
Again?

1387
01:38:55,782 --> 01:38:57,019
Which one?

1388
01:38:58,017 --> 01:38:59,082
Him.

1389
01:38:59,398 --> 01:39:00,462
Go on.

1390
01:39:00,769 --> 01:39:01,950
l heard Yago say...

1391
01:39:02,276 --> 01:39:03,531
- What if it rains?
- So?

1392
01:39:03,877 --> 01:39:05,584
- We'll skid.
- It won't rain.

1393
01:39:05,987 --> 01:39:07,895
lf it gets damaged?
l got payments due.

1394
01:39:08,326 --> 01:39:09,699
We'll reimburse you.

1395
01:39:10,053 --> 01:39:11,233
All the payments?

1396
01:39:11,558 --> 01:39:12,450
Hey, Yago!

1397
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:14,139
The varnisher phoned.

1398
01:39:14,503 --> 01:39:17,792
He needs some coffins delivered.

1399
01:39:20,104 --> 01:39:22,262
lt's a good sign.
See you tonight.

1400
01:39:25,062 --> 01:39:26,722
Then he came over to me.

1401
01:39:28,841 --> 01:39:30,499
l'll buy you a drink.

1402
01:39:31,881 --> 01:39:33,675
As he sat down
l saw the club.

1403
01:39:34,087 --> 01:39:35,430
What's that for?

1404
01:39:36,129 --> 01:39:39,246
A delivery job tonight.
It'll make things easier.

1405
01:39:39,936 --> 01:39:41,309
What kind of delivery?

1406
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:43,725
A delivery to hell.

1407
01:39:44,099 --> 01:39:45,921
A deputy from the capital.

1408
01:39:46,344 --> 01:39:47,658
Don't get into trouble.

1409
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:49,633
No one will know.

1410
01:39:49,988 --> 01:39:51,868
lf they find out,
l'll know it was you.

1411
01:39:56,289 --> 01:39:58,839
Later, the same man
came back.

1412
01:40:22,663 --> 01:40:24,321
The colonel looks different
in civvies.

1413
01:40:24,705 --> 01:40:27,965
- How do you know him?
- l applied for a three-wheeler permit.

1414
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:32,627
Every six months, l go to him to renew it.
l always saw him in uniform.

1415
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,129
But why pick Yago?

1416
01:40:40,098 --> 01:40:42,256
He's the best driver in town.

1417
01:40:42,726 --> 01:40:46,436
You should see him
drive his kamikaze.

1418
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:51,770
This fellow
has a political history.

1419
01:40:52,258 --> 01:40:55,126
During the Occupation,
he was in the Communist underground.

1420
01:40:55,683 --> 01:40:57,361
He was deported to the islands.

1421
01:40:57,831 --> 01:41:00,247
- So his testimony -
- Is suspect, of course.

1422
01:41:00,746 --> 01:41:02,404
l wouldn't use it.

1423
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,007
Leave him.

1424
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:21,180
lsn't it obvious they're targeting
troublesome witnesses?

1425
01:42:22,025 --> 01:42:24,499
They just tried
a quicker method on me.

1426
01:42:24,998 --> 01:42:28,172
- What are you talking about?
- Attempted murder. Just now.

1427
01:42:28,777 --> 01:42:30,799
The plot continues

1428
01:42:31,241 --> 01:42:32,363
as long as the culprits are free.

1429
01:42:32,804 --> 01:42:34,712
l'm the magistrate here.
Spare me your advice.

1430
01:42:35,145 --> 01:42:38,596
This affair started at the top.
The police are a tool.

1431
01:42:39,239 --> 01:42:41,320
They don't have
the means or the guts

1432
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:45,118
to commit a murder like this
without being covered.

1433
01:42:45,857 --> 01:42:49,598
The guilty ones are in the government
or higher up at the palace,

1434
01:42:50,279 --> 01:42:52,916
where the general
was head of the guard.

1435
01:42:53,443 --> 01:42:54,594
And since the palace

1436
01:42:54,977 --> 01:42:56,608
has its foreign protectors -

1437
01:42:57,001 --> 01:42:58,487
One more word

1438
01:42:58,851 --> 01:43:02,247
and l'll charge you with insulting
the state and the courts.

1439
01:43:03,685 --> 01:43:05,393
This isn't a rally.

1440
01:43:06,918 --> 01:43:07,924
What happened?

1441
01:43:08,452 --> 01:43:09,824
They tried to kill me.

1442
01:43:10,179 --> 01:43:12,201
They knew l had
vital information for you.

1443
01:43:12,643 --> 01:43:15,366
On my way here,
a car tried to run me down.

1444
01:43:15,913 --> 01:43:17,150
Any witnesses?

1445
01:43:17,476 --> 01:43:22,138
Here are the names of three honest
God-fearing housewives who'll testify,

1446
01:43:22,952 --> 01:43:24,689
and the park guard,

1447
01:43:25,092 --> 01:43:26,299
a decorated war veteran.

1448
01:43:26,625 --> 01:43:28,199
And your vital information?

1449
01:43:29,033 --> 01:43:31,556
The VW was a police vehicle.

1450
01:43:33,445 --> 01:43:35,689
The one that took him
to the hospital?

1451
01:43:36,225 --> 01:43:39,170
But as no police were allow,ed in
the car to finish him off

1452
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:42,248
the driver took detours.

1453
01:43:42,757 --> 01:43:43,822
l know. l was there.

1454
01:43:44,138 --> 01:43:47,342
How odd. l know the car belongs
to one of your friends.

1455
01:43:47,946 --> 01:43:51,456
Surely a friend of theirs.
He helped carry the victim.

1456
01:43:52,099 --> 01:43:54,736
Who told you that nonsense?

1457
01:43:55,272 --> 01:43:58,505
The car vanished.
No trace of it at the hospital.

1458
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:01,382
The page was torn out
of the registry.

1459
01:44:01,862 --> 01:44:03,406
Don't you find that odd?

1460
01:44:06,091 --> 01:44:09,063
l think you did it
to add grist to your mill.

1461
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:11,940
ls this the car?

1462
01:44:14,021 --> 01:44:15,815
Find the owner of this car.

1463
01:44:18,309 --> 01:44:19,594
You want to wash up?

1464
01:44:20,745 --> 01:44:22,288
Thanks. l'm all right.

1465
01:44:23,076 --> 01:44:24,168
Sit down.

1466
01:44:26,499 --> 01:44:28,235
Let's hear your revelations.

1467
01:44:28,647 --> 01:44:32,302
But you risk indictment for perjury
and obstruction ofjustice.

1468
01:44:33,317 --> 01:44:33,990
Go ahead.

1469
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:38,487
The car was waiting there,
hidden by the police.

1470
01:44:39,494 --> 01:44:41,288
And when
the three-wheeler came?

1471
01:44:41,892 --> 01:44:43,349
He came forward.

1472
01:44:43,943 --> 01:44:45,229
Mr. Head of Security!

1473
01:44:48,807 --> 01:44:50,379
Mr. Chief of Police!

1474
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:54,091
He wanted the general to clear
the square to avoid fighting.

1475
01:44:55,271 --> 01:44:56,527
Come on.

1476
01:45:03,048 --> 01:45:04,563
What are you waiting for?

1477
01:45:06,529 --> 01:45:08,015
l saw the three-wheeler.

1478
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:08,975
Watch out!

1479
01:45:09,666 --> 01:45:12,783
Was the man in back standing?
Could he have hit him?

1480
01:45:13,387 --> 01:45:15,803
l can't say.
It all happened so fast.

1481
01:45:16,581 --> 01:45:17,415
And then?

1482
01:45:17,703 --> 01:45:19,044
He fell to his knees.

1483
01:45:19,399 --> 01:45:20,800
lt was chaos.

1484
01:45:21,154 --> 01:45:22,364
His knees?

1485
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:24,712
His head didn't hit the ground?

1486
01:45:25,154 --> 01:45:27,005
No, he was on his knees

1487
01:45:27,426 --> 01:45:29,584
surrounded by demonstrators
swarming in.

1488
01:45:30,055 --> 01:45:31,599
The police just stood there.

1489
01:45:31,973 --> 01:45:34,389
Which demonstrators?
Who was with him?

1490
01:45:34,889 --> 01:45:36,259
lmpossible to say.

1491
01:45:38,887 --> 01:45:42,819
We pulled them away.
That's when he collapsed.

1492
01:45:48,459 --> 01:45:49,668
A VW drove up.

1493
01:45:50,186 --> 01:45:51,844
From where, l don't know.

1494
01:45:59,881 --> 01:46:03,929
Only then did the police intervene.
They tried to get into the car.

1495
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:13,356
Come on!

1496
01:46:19,176 --> 01:46:20,750
Quick! To the hospital!

1497
01:46:24,202 --> 01:46:25,410
Get going!

1498
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:32,641
Faster! Use your horn.

1499
01:46:33,159 --> 01:46:34,819
ls it broken?

1500
01:46:35,942 --> 01:46:39,624
Turn right!
- l'm just avoiding traffic.

1501
01:46:40,554 --> 01:46:44,543
He did it to waste time.
Then he hit another car.

1502
01:46:45,762 --> 01:46:47,948
You're doing it on purpose.

1503
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:50,269
We have to make a report.

1504
01:46:51,651 --> 01:46:54,824
A man's been hurt.
It's a matter of life or death.

1505
01:46:55,946 --> 01:46:57,712
Okay, go on.

1506
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:06,909
He did it on purpose.

1507
01:47:07,273 --> 01:47:10,246
The cops would've
finished him off in the car.

1508
01:47:10,822 --> 01:47:12,337
l did it on purpose?

1509
01:47:12,835 --> 01:47:14,801
That's unfair. l did my best.

1510
01:47:15,271 --> 01:47:17,630
They were upset.
l don't blame them.

1511
01:47:18,379 --> 01:47:20,431
Everyone ignored me
at the hospital.

1512
01:47:21,611 --> 01:47:25,773
l'd rented the car
for a date that afternoon.

1513
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,113
l'd just dropped the girl off.

1514
01:47:28,458 --> 01:47:29,858
Traffic was cut off.

1515
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:34,298
l must've passed a roadblock
without security realizing it.

1516
01:47:36,802 --> 01:47:39,919
At the hospital, l washed
the blood off the car seats.

1517
01:47:40,523 --> 01:47:43,496
You just stated,
''l'm a part-time chauffeur.''

1518
01:47:44,579 --> 01:47:46,824
But you rented the car
as a serviceman.

1519
01:47:47,304 --> 01:47:49,691
- l'm doing my military service.
- In what branch?

1520
01:47:50,948 --> 01:47:52,550
Military police.

1521
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,302
So you're a police driver.

1522
01:48:02,082 --> 01:48:03,118
Which department?

1523
01:48:04,298 --> 01:48:06,092
A department
close to the general.

1524
01:48:06,791 --> 01:48:07,770
How close?

1525
01:48:08,297 --> 01:48:09,275
Let's say personal.

1526
01:48:09,573 --> 01:48:10,387
For how long?

1527
01:48:11,586 --> 01:48:12,565
A year.

1528
01:48:13,093 --> 01:48:15,307
The general's driver
for the past year.

1529
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:18,664
And you just happened
onto the scene of the murder?

1530
01:48:19,307 --> 01:48:20,371
Excuse me, sir.

1531
01:48:20,679 --> 01:48:22,386
Do l type ''murder''?

1532
01:48:22,789 --> 01:48:23,938
You said ''murder.''

1533
01:48:40,262 --> 01:48:42,765
The prosecutor just phoned.
Do you know who's here?

1534
01:48:43,273 --> 01:48:44,933
The attorney general.

1535
01:48:45,316 --> 01:48:46,496
Leave us alone.

1536
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:51,215
The attorney general
has come to see you,

1537
01:48:51,818 --> 01:48:53,478
in secret and incognito.

1538
01:48:55,587 --> 01:48:56,796
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor?

1539
01:48:57,122 --> 01:48:58,359
Yes, he's here.

1540
01:48:58,887 --> 01:49:00,402
We'll be right down.

1541
01:49:10,116 --> 01:49:12,304
So it's you. Take a seat.

1542
01:49:16,484 --> 01:49:19,630
So you'd indict the chiefs
of police and security?

1543
01:49:20,234 --> 01:49:21,443
lt's inevitable -

1544
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:24,435
Only events dictated
by divine will are inevitable.

1545
01:49:24,963 --> 01:49:26,450
The body of proof
is damning, sir.

1546
01:49:26,853 --> 01:49:28,934
Proof? Malicious gossip!

1547
01:49:29,384 --> 01:49:32,750
So-called proof
invented by pacifists

1548
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:35,531
who want to create a hero.

1549
01:49:35,943 --> 01:49:39,234
Certainly, sir,
but the collusion of police

1550
01:49:39,847 --> 01:49:41,785
with demonstrators
has been established.

1551
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:46,024
These two circled in red
are plainclothesmen.

1552
01:49:46,666 --> 01:49:49,562
They took part in the demonstration.
They've even confessed.

1553
01:49:50,819 --> 01:49:53,936
We also know that
the head of security met Yago that day,

1554
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:56,160
along with other demonstrators.

1555
01:49:56,553 --> 01:49:59,670
The general said he didn't know
the driver of the VW.

1556
01:50:00,486 --> 01:50:03,853
ln fact, he's the general's
personal driver.

1557
01:50:05,416 --> 01:50:07,995
l'll skip the matter
of police passivity.

1558
01:50:08,523 --> 01:50:11,132
Then comes the intimidation
of witnesses.

1559
01:50:11,975 --> 01:50:16,300
Vago is hospitalized secretly
with a police medical certificate.

1560
01:50:17,193 --> 01:50:20,903
He's found prowling near the room
of a witness with a club.

1561
01:50:22,314 --> 01:50:25,603
Then there's the crime weapon,
the club Yago carried

1562
01:50:26,216 --> 01:50:27,847
and which witnesses saw.

1563
01:50:28,299 --> 01:50:31,530
This club disappeared
during his arrest,

1564
01:50:32,259 --> 01:50:35,040
but the officer admitted
he rewrote his report.

1565
01:50:35,587 --> 01:50:37,947
You're not to mention
the club in your report.

1566
01:50:38,435 --> 01:50:39,586
But it's done, sir.

1567
01:50:40,104 --> 01:50:41,954
l'm the inspector general.

1568
01:50:43,691 --> 01:50:45,005
At ease.

1569
01:50:45,926 --> 01:50:48,898
No need to defend yourself.
You were doing your duty.

1570
01:50:49,484 --> 01:50:51,535
How long have you been
in the service?

1571
01:50:51,976 --> 01:50:53,377
Six years.

1572
01:50:54,019 --> 01:50:56,437
lt's simple.
Just rewrite your report.

1573
01:50:57,347 --> 01:50:59,400
Mr. Prosecutor!

1574
01:51:00,196 --> 01:51:02,804
That's when you walked in, sir.

1575
01:51:04,099 --> 01:51:08,280
The officer couldn't lie.
His confession will cost him dearly.

1576
01:51:09,384 --> 01:51:11,483
There are grounds for indictment,

1577
01:51:11,945 --> 01:51:14,245
but not enough
to sentence police officers.

1578
01:51:14,725 --> 01:51:17,056
The jury will do its duty.
l have to do mine.

1579
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:20,806
You'll discredit the police,
as well as the court,

1580
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:23,749
which will be blamed
for not sentencing them.

1581
01:51:24,901 --> 01:51:26,301
As if it's not enough

1582
01:51:26,665 --> 01:51:28,794
that our country's been invaded
by long-haired thugs,

1583
01:51:29,255 --> 01:51:32,286
atheists and junkies
of unclear sex,

1584
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:35,738
now you want to disparage
our armed forces and courts

1585
01:51:36,294 --> 01:51:39,890
the only elements
not corrupted by parliamentarianism.

1586
01:51:40,553 --> 01:51:42,826
Just when we d,ream
of renewal

1587
01:51:43,333 --> 01:51:46,144
a country without parties,
without Left or Right,

1588
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:48,570
heeding God and its destiny,

1589
01:51:49,827 --> 01:51:51,620
you want to ruin it all.

1590
01:51:53,154 --> 01:51:54,362
Listen to me.

1591
01:51:55,015 --> 01:51:56,952
Let me make a suggestion.

1592
01:51:58,755 --> 01:52:00,356
l understand your scruples.

1593
01:52:01,833 --> 01:52:03,378
They're to your credit.

1594
01:52:03,751 --> 01:52:07,090
My idea should satisfy you,
the government and the palace.

1595
01:52:09,478 --> 01:52:11,500
Divide the case
into three parts.

1596
01:52:12,652 --> 01:52:14,752
First, try the two criminals.

1597
01:52:15,203 --> 01:52:17,083
Let justice be done.

1598
01:52:17,609 --> 01:52:19,288
Second, the police authorities.

1599
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:21,907
Their negligence is evident,
or at least probable,

1600
01:52:23,018 --> 01:52:26,337
but it lies outside the jurisdiction
of a circuit court.

1601
01:52:26,951 --> 01:52:30,288
lt's an administrative matter
that can be handled internally.

1602
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:36,014
Third, bring an action
against the rally organizers.

1603
01:52:36,868 --> 01:52:41,500
Their inflammatory speech makes them
morally responsible for the violence.

1604
01:52:43,082 --> 01:52:47,494
lt's an old rule of thumb.
Who stands to gain the most?

1605
01:52:49,191 --> 01:52:52,509
The justice minister asked me
if you were a Leftist.

1606
01:52:53,124 --> 01:52:54,974
l categorically denied it.

1607
01:52:56,874 --> 01:52:59,348
Here's a list
of useful witnesses.

1608
01:53:00,939 --> 01:53:04,987
lt seems no one meant to kill
the deputy, just intimidate him.

1609
01:53:06,474 --> 01:53:08,132
l trust l've convinced you

1610
01:53:09,188 --> 01:53:12,447
to protect the honor
of the forces of law and order.

1611
01:53:13,771 --> 01:53:19,334
But you're accountable only
to your conscience, after God.

1612
01:53:32,492 --> 01:53:33,835
l won't bear this dishonor.

1613
01:53:34,179 --> 01:53:36,308
lndict me
and l'll commit suicide.

1614
01:53:36,778 --> 01:53:38,323
Dishonor is intolerable.

1615
01:53:38,696 --> 01:53:41,056
lf need be, my blood will flow
in this very room.

1616
01:53:41,737 --> 01:53:43,645
Name and occupation.

1617
01:53:45,285 --> 01:53:46,916
You have to answer.

1618
01:53:57,158 --> 01:53:58,617
Sign your statement.

1619
01:54:08,197 --> 01:54:11,457
You are officially charged
with first-degree murder.

1620
01:54:12,168 --> 01:54:13,846
Your arrest warrant is ready.

1621
01:54:14,469 --> 01:54:17,472
The law grants officers
24 hours before incarceration.

1622
01:54:18,056 --> 01:54:20,445
To avoid the press,
use that door.

1623
01:54:50,376 --> 01:54:52,879
You are charged
with first-degree murder.

1624
01:55:06,028 --> 01:55:07,342
This is intolerable!

1625
01:55:07,811 --> 01:55:09,719
Disgraceful!
You have no right!

1626
01:55:17,095 --> 01:55:19,148
l've been thrown to the hounds.

1627
01:55:19,781 --> 01:55:21,516
Name and occupation.

1628
01:55:25,831 --> 01:55:28,019
You are charged
with first-degree murder.

1629
01:55:49,481 --> 01:55:50,690
Take a seat.

1630
01:55:53,702 --> 01:55:56,089
For me
l see no alternative.

1631
01:55:56,589 --> 01:55:59,706
Either l'm cleared
or l commit suicide to avoid dishonor.

1632
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:01,671
Name and occupation.

1633
01:56:02,026 --> 01:56:03,598
lt's routine, General.

1634
01:56:04,423 --> 01:56:06,131
What did you do the day
of the murder?

1635
01:56:07,271 --> 01:56:09,325
l'd decided to attend the Bolshoi.

1636
01:56:09,766 --> 01:56:13,554
Not out of love for dance.
l'm no pervert, thank God.

1637
01:56:14,378 --> 01:56:16,796
But it was a chance
to spot sympathizers.

1638
01:56:20,747 --> 01:56:22,655
The morning of the murder,

1639
01:56:23,077 --> 01:56:25,771
you were informed
of a threat on the victim's life.

1640
01:56:26,952 --> 01:56:28,888
No one told me
of any death threats.

1641
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:32,946
l'm convinced it was only a tactic
to justify any incidents.

1642
01:56:37,318 --> 01:56:39,284
My men couldn't stop
the three-wheeler,

1643
01:56:40,004 --> 01:56:43,322
but a man leaped,
onto the flatbed

1644
01:56:43,945 --> 01:56:47,370
like a tiger,
lithe and ferocious as a tiger.

1645
01:56:55,818 --> 01:56:57,756
l know no one
in that organization.

1646
01:56:58,187 --> 01:57:01,161
l have no contact
with these combatants... this CROC.

1647
01:57:01,736 --> 01:57:04,911
l have a photo of a banquet
you gave for them

1648
01:57:05,515 --> 01:57:08,910
as thanks for maintaining order
during a state visit.

1649
01:57:09,543 --> 01:57:11,902
ls he a Communist?
Why is he after me?

1650
01:57:12,775 --> 01:57:14,874
His father was a colonel
in the military police.

1651
01:57:19,690 --> 01:57:22,192
This photo's doctored.
It's no proof.

1652
01:57:23,181 --> 01:57:25,732
First-degree murder
and abuse of authority.

1653
01:57:35,917 --> 01:57:38,016
Are you a victim like Dreyfus?

1654
01:57:38,505 --> 01:57:40,299
Dreyfus was guilty!

1655
01:58:04,621 --> 01:58:05,876
Hélène!

1656
01:58:14,824 --> 01:58:17,242
They've all been charged,
even the general.

1657
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:20,933
The magistrate didn't back down.

1658
01:58:21,797 --> 01:58:23,820
You see?
It's as if he were still alive.

1659
01:58:26,986 --> 01:58:28,664
lt's a real revolution.

1660
01:58:29,547 --> 01:58:32,913
The government will fall.
The extremists will be swept away.

1661
01:58:33,546 --> 01:58:35,704
The elections will be
a landslide victory.

1662
01:58:46,857 --> 01:58:47,778
THE TRIAL

1663
01:58:48,804 --> 01:58:50,684
The deputy prosecutor
never made the trial.

1664
01:58:51,114 --> 01:58:53,925
He died of a heart attack
according to the coroner.

1665
01:58:54,855 --> 01:58:58,729
Seven other witnesses died
before the trial.

1666
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:00,840
A car accident.

1667
01:59:01,157 --> 01:59:02,134
A gas explosion.

1668
01:59:02,661 --> 01:59:03,496
A suicide.

1669
01:59:04,004 --> 01:59:04,896
A drowning.

1670
01:59:05,386 --> 01:59:06,623
A work accident.

1671
01:59:07,083 --> 01:59:08,454
A second car accident.

1672
01:59:08,809 --> 01:59:10,661
And a heart attack while driving.

1673
01:59:11,082 --> 01:59:14,793
''Foul play is ruled out,''
the new head of security declared.

1674
01:59:15,466 --> 01:59:18,017
After a three-month trial
Vago was sentenced

1675
01:59:18,534 --> 01:59:20,356
to eight years on a prison farm,

1676
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:22,457
where one year equals two.

1677
01:59:23,205 --> 01:59:25,199
Yago, 11 years of the same.

1678
01:59:25,929 --> 01:59:27,836
Ten months
for disturbing the peace.

1679
01:59:28,326 --> 01:59:29,898
Twelve months
with a possibility

1680
01:59:30,311 --> 01:59:31,683
of paying off his term.

1681
01:59:32,459 --> 01:59:33,552
For the four indicted officers

1682
01:59:33,859 --> 01:59:36,728
charges dropped,
with administrative reprimands.

1683
01:59:37,292 --> 01:59:39,988
The scandal led
to the government's resignation.

1684
01:59:40,525 --> 01:59:42,827
After the trial,
the opposition united,

1685
01:59:43,307 --> 01:59:45,013
certain to win the elections.

1686
01:59:45,415 --> 01:59:46,729
Weeks before elections

1687
01:59:47,084 --> 01:59:49,780
the military seized power
and dismissed the magistrate.

1688
01:59:50,853 --> 01:59:54,901
During transport in a police van,
Deputy Georges Pirou

1689
01:59:55,621 --> 01:59:57,702
died of a stroke
according to police.

1690
01:59:58,727 --> 01:59:59,878
Deported to the islands.

1691
02:00:00,712 --> 02:00:03,071
Fell from the seventh floor
during questioning.

1692
02:00:03,561 --> 02:00:05,354
Attempted to escape,
according to police.

1693
02:00:06,093 --> 02:00:09,325
Three years for disclosure
of official documents.

1694
02:00:10,246 --> 02:00:12,154
The military
regime banned

1695
02:00:13,162 --> 02:00:15,243
long hair,
miniskirts,

1696
02:00:15,692 --> 02:00:18,301
Sophocles,
Tolstoy, Euripides,

1697
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:21,495
Russian-style toasts,
strikes,

1698
02:00:22,022 --> 02:00:25,053
Aristophanes,
Ionesco, Sartre,

1699
02:00:25,639 --> 02:00:27,518
Albee, Pinter,

1700
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:29,226
freedom
of the press,

1701
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:30,818
sociology,

1702
02:00:31,144 --> 02:00:32,965
Beckett
Dostoyevsky,

1703
02:00:33,483 --> 02:00:35,872
modern music,
pop music,

1704
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:37,645
new math

1705
02:00:38,441 --> 02:00:42,652
and the letter Z, which means
HE LlVES in Ancient Greek.
