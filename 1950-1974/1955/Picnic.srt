1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,492
Hey, son!

2
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,373
This is where you wanted off.

3
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,210
Oh. Well, thank you, sir.

4
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,963
And thank you for the hitch too.

5
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,760
I've ridden 'em lots of times when I was
your age myself. What do you want here?

6
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,762
Friend of mine lives here.

7
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,223
His old man's a big shot
in the grain business.

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,516
Real rich.

9
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,644
Honest.
Sure.

10
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,063
The governor's an old sidekick of mine.

11
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,148
That's how I got this job.

12
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,256
Millie! Does it make your mouth water?

13
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,967
It's beautiful, Mrs. Potts.

14
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,262
Thank you, dear.

15
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,036
Ma'am?

16
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,246
Yes?

17
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,041
Uh, about your yard, ma'am.

18
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,878
I could, uh... I could rake it up and, uh,

19
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:37,174
burn your trash for you
or any other kind of job needs done.

20
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:41,428
My gracious. Nobody works today.

21
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,057
No?
It's Labor Day.

22
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,186
Are you hungry?

23
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,233
I guess my stomach didn't know
it was Labor Day, ma'am.

24
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,861
You just stop being embarrassed and come
in and have some breakfast.

25
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,240
Not unless I clean up your yard.
All right, but after you eat.

26
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,701
Come on. Get in the house.
Get something to eat.

27
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,060
Madge!

28
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,105
Dry your silly hair over somebody else.

29
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:37,234
Well, why don't you read your silly book
under somebody else?

30
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,124
Oh! My, it's hot and still today.

31
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,420
It looks lovely, dear.

32
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,547
I wish it didn't take so long to dry.

33
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,301
I think one summer I'll cut it short.
Madge!

34
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,970
She's just talking.
The way she primps and fusses,

35
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,764
somebody'd think she was
the queen of Sheba.

36
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,808
Well, if you fussed
with yourself a little,

37
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,186
maybe you'd have a date
for the picnic today.

38
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,272
I don't want any of these crazy boys
in town to take me anywhere.

39
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,984
♪ Beggars can't be choosers ♪

40
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,986
Madge, that's mean.

41
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,032
There'll be dancing at the pavilion tonight.
Millie ought to have a date.

42
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,702
All she has to do, Mom,
is dress up and act decent.

43
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,580
I will dress and act the way I want.

44
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:43,133
Anybody mind if an old-maid
schoolteacher joins their company?

45
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,135
Morning, Miss Sydney.
Morning, Miss Sydney.

46
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,763
Come out and join us, Rosemary.

47
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,100
- Mail in yet?
- It's a holiday.

48
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,479
Aw, that's right. I forgot.

49
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:04,821
Thought there might be a letter from that man
I met at the high school dance last spring.

50
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,115
Been wantin' to marry me ever since.

51
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,453
He was a peck of fun.

52
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,873
But I don't have time for any of 'em
when they start getting serious on me.

53
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,961
You schoolteachers
are mighty independent.

54
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,799
Shoot. I've lived this long
without a man.

55
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,510
I don't see what's to keep me
from getting on without one.

56
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,973
- What about Howard?
- Howard Bevans?

57
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:35,769
He's just a friend-boy,
not a boyfriend.

58
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,776
I'll bet you never had cherry pie
for breakfast before, did you?

59
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,820
No, ma'am, I never did.

60
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,408
I'll get started on your yard now.

61
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,827
Oh, you've had such a big breakfast.

62
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,037
Wouldn't you like to rest for a while?

63
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,540
No, ma'am.
Work's good for my digestion.

64
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:10,053
I was, uh, figuring to look up this
friend of mine that lives here.

65
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:14,766
Uh, I was in college with him...
some years back.

66
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,936
You look like a college man.

67
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,938
Thank you, ma'am.

68
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,858
I, uh, don't suppose you'd know him.
His name's Alan Benson.

69
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,360
Alan Benson! Why, of course!

70
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,196
He visits one of the girls next door.

71
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,324
What do you know?

72
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,285
It's right around here.

73
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,664
It'll be awful hot in that jacket.
You'd better take it off.

74
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,417
My shirt's awful dirty, ma'am.

75
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,419
I'll wash it for ya.

76
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,090
Do you think anybody'd mind?
Oh, of course not!

77
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,427
You're a man. What's the difference?

78
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,471
Helen!

79
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,682
It's my mother. She lives upstairs.

80
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,226
She's an invalid, you see.

81
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,729
She's very old.

82
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,899
Sure. Older people take a lot of care.

83
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,901
Helen!

84
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,197
All right, Mama!
I'm coming! I'm coming!

85
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,894
Workin' over there naked as an Indian.

86
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,896
Who's naked as an Indian?

87
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,607
Who does he think is interested?

88
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,906
Good morning.
Hey, Bomber, you stupe.

89
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,159
- You wanna knock the house down?
- Go back to bed, will ya?

90
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,912
Go blow your nose!

91
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,540
Tell your pretty sister to come out.

92
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,084
It's no fun lookin' at you, goon face.

93
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,670
You take that back, you dirty little pest!

94
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,297
Hey, look at goon face!
She fights just like a man.

95
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,591
Oh, boy! Ow!

96
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,725
One of these days you're
gonna come around here,

97
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,893
and I'll shoot you, so help me!

98
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,188
Morning, Madge.
Hello, Bomber.

99
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,737
A bunch of us guys
are, uh, chippin' in on a hot rod.

100
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,239
I get it every Friday night.

101
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,909
Well, don't expect to honk the horn
and have me run out.

102
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,913
If a boy wants a date, he can come to the
door like a gentleman and ask if I'm in.

103
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,208
Alan Benson sends her flowers
every time they go out.

104
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,670
I can't send ya flowers,
baby, but, uh,

105
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,590
I can... send ya.

106
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,300
Eew!

107
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,263
Let me pick ya up some night
after Benson brings ya home, huh?

108
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,309
Oh, Bomber, will you
stop being ridiculous?

109
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,982
I seen ya ridin' around in his
convertible like you was a duchess.

110
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:14,613
Why do good-looking girls
have to be so stuck on themselves?

111
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,157
I am not stuck on myself!

112
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,118
Let me pick ya up some night after
Benson brings ya home. Come on, Madge.

113
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,205
Bomber, will you let me alone?
Come on. Give a guy a break.

114
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,582
On your way, lover boy.

115
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,711
Who are you?

116
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,424
What's that matter?
I'm bigger than you are.

117
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,848
Hey, I'm late on my route! Yeah!

118
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,894
Go on! Go peddle your papers!

119
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,650
Drop dead. Hi.

120
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,860
Hi.

121
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,243
Hey, you workin' for Mrs. Potts?

122
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,082
Uh, just doin' a few odd jobs in the yard.

123
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,543
She give you breakfast?
Millie, stop it.

124
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,420
I need you girls to help me
with the picnic sandwiches, so...

125
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,051
Is there something you want,
young man?

126
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,428
Just... loafin', ma'am.

127
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,140
This is a busy day for us.
We have no time to loaf.

128
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,187
Are you the, uh, mother?

129
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,939
Yes.

130
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,122
Come on, Millie. Madge!

131
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,375
Madge?
Yes?

132
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,627
Come here! Come here a minute!

133
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,470
He knows Alan.

134
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,391
Isn't that nice?

135
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,894
Yeah.

136
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,730
I never been to Kansas before.

137
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,190
Maybe you can tell me where Benson lives.

138
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,736
He lives on the other end of town.

139
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,408
- Ask anyone over there. Alan's father's an elevator man.
- Huh?

140
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,870
Yes, he owns all those
big grain elevators.

141
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,705
Madge!

142
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:37,339
See ya.

143
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,239
Nice chip, Dad.

144
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,992
Keep your head down,
Son, and follow through.

145
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,330
Benson?

146
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,584
Hal Carter!

147
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,628
Kid.

148
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,006
Well, where did you come from?

149
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,175
Oh, around.

150
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,470
You old son of a gun.
Of all people... How are you?

151
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,764
Hey, now watch it, watch it!
No, no!

152
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,141
Hey! Remember how we used
to wake up that fraternity?

153
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,144
Do I!
Yahoo!

154
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,481
Who's winkin', blinkin' and stinkin'?

155
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,525
Dad, this is Hal Carter.

156
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,527
Oh, yes, so it is.

157
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,487
I remember you on the football field.

158
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,865
Thank you, Mr. Benson, sir. You still
look able to dodge a few tacklers.

159
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:50,745
You look pretty fit yourself, sir.
I try.

160
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,749
Great guy.

161
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,252
When did you get into town?

162
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,255
Early this morning.
Imagine living in a place like this.

163
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,049
Why didn't you come
to see me first thing?

164
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,135
I didn't want to walk in
on you looking like a bum.

165
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,929
I thought... I thought maybe
I'd scrounge around,

166
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,931
get me a little change
and pick me up a new shirt.

167
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,017
That wouldn't have made any difference.

168
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,686
Hal Carter!

169
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,938
Where have you been all these years?

170
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:21,568
Oh, I was...
workin' back home in the fillin' station.

171
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,570
Then I was in the Army.

172
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,572
Yeah? How long?

173
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,991
Till I got out.

174
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,995
I, uh, heard you went to Hollywood
to become a big movie hero.

175
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,124
I was gonna have a big career.

176
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,334
They were gonna call me
"Brush" Carter.

177
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,046
What happened, "Brush"?

178
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,882
This babe told me they were
gonna have to pull out all my teeth...

179
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,967
and get me new ones, so, naturally, I...

180
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,094
Wait a minute. What babe?

181
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,806
The babe that got me the screen test.

182
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,269
She wasn't exactly a babe.
She was kinda beat up, but, uh,

183
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,897
not bad.

184
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,649
Same old Hal.

185
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,154
- Aren't you glad to see me?
- Well, sure.

186
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,199
How about lending me a razor?

187
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,576
Okay. Go on, now. Fill me in.

188
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,206
After I left Hollywood,
I took a job on a ranch in Nevada.

189
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,208
You'd have been proud of me.

190
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:22,420
In bed every night at 10:00,
up every morning at 6:00.

191
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,507
No liquor, no babes, no nothin'.

192
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,593
I even saved up 200 bucks.
Then I got rolled.

193
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,595
Rolled? You?

194
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,103
I was, um,

195
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,939
hitchhiking my way down to Texas...

196
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,982
on a big oil deal...

197
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,904
when two babes pull up
in this big yellow convertible.

198
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,573
One of 'em slams on the brake
and hollers,

199
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,952
"Hey, beefcake, get in."

200
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,455
So I...

201
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,707
got in.

202
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,876
Benson, it was crazy.

203
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,045
They had a shakerful of martinis...

204
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,464
right there in the car.
Remembering old times?

205
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,466
Yes, sir... No, sir.

206
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:13,179
I'm due at the club, Alan.
Join me later, if you wish.

207
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,473
I've got a date, Dad.

208
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,226
Same young lady?
Of course.

209
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:26,109
- Delighted to have seen you, Carter.
- It's mutual, sir.

210
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,028
Great car. Go on, now.

211
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,656
Tell me what happened exactly.

212
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,035
Well, you know me.
I'm an agreeable guy.

213
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,664
Sure! So when they parked in
front of this tourist cabin,

214
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,833
I said...

215
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:47,005
"Okay, girls. If I gotta pay for the ride,
this is the easiest way I know."

216
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,092
So we got busy... on the martinis.

217
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,512
They must have thought I was Superman.

218
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,682
Nothin' like that ever happens to me.

219
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,727
So then I said, "Okay, girls."

220
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,980
Party's over. Let's get going."

221
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,608
And one of them sticks a gun
right in my back and says,

222
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,111
"This party's goin' on till
we say it's over, Buck!"

223
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,282
You'd have thought
she was Humphrey Bogart.

224
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,284
Wait a minute. Then what?

225
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,286
So finally I passed out.

226
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,414
And when I woke up, the dames were
gone, and so was my 200 bucks.

227
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,541
I went to the police,
and they wouldn't believe me.

228
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,836
They said my story was wishful thinking.
How do you like that?

229
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,967
I'm telling you, Benson.
Women are gettin' desperate.

230
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,053
Yeah.

231
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,183
Be awfully nice to be
married to Alan, Madge.

232
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,185
Better get busy.

233
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,230
Busy? Pretty girl
doesn't have long.

234
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,232
Just a few years.

235
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,694
Then she's the equal of kings.

236
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,531
She can walk out of a shanty like this...

237
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,951
and live in a palace.

238
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,788
If she loses her chance
when she's young,

239
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,874
she might as well throw
all her prettiness away.

240
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,918
I'm only 19.

241
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,338
And next summer you'll be 20.

242
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,175
And then 21, and then... 40.

243
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,305
You don't have to be morbid.

244
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,474
Is this a private party I'm crashing?

245
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,644
Oh, no. I won't be back for
lunch today, Mrs. Owens.

246
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,981
There's a welcome-home party
down at the hotel...

247
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,693
for the new girls on the faculty.

248
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:36,698
My, isn't that scrumptious?

249
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,783
Oh, oh!

250
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,577
You'll be the belle of the ball, Madge.

251
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,414
You look awfully nice
yourself, Miss Sydney.

252
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,416
It's the new fall outfit.

253
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,085
You schoolteachers
certainly have nice things.

254
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,422
Got it in Kansas City.
Paid 22.50 for the hat.

255
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,553
Good land, Mrs. Owens. You let your
daughter read filthy books like that?

256
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,555
"Filthy"?
What are you reading?

257
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,557
The Ballad of the Sad Cafe.

258
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,018
And it's not filthy.
It's wonderful!

259
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,604
All I know is somebody wanted
it banned from the public library.

260
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,606
Millie... It's on the
reading list at college,

261
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,151
and Alan Benson loaned it to me.

262
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,695
Oh, dear.

263
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,323
What is a person to believe?

264
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:23,036
Those college professors
don't have any morals.

265
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,246
Bye, now.
Bye.

266
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,503
Madge, let's get at this dress.

267
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,100
Everybody around here gets
to dress up and go places except me.

268
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,021
That's because you're not
interested in boys.

269
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:54,359
You'd think all boys ever cared about
was what somebody wears.

270
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,904
Well, they do care about
how they look and act, though.

271
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,864
And how they smell,
a lot of the time.

272
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,242
Girls, don't fight.
La-di-da.

273
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,370
Madge is the pretty one,

274
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,248
but she's so dumb they almost had to burn
the schoolhouse down to get her out of it.

275
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,459
That is not so!

276
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,711
You have to work in the dime store.

277
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,548
Well, Bomber was right.
You are a goon!

278
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,843
Madge, you slut!
You take that back, or I'll kill you!

279
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,887
Girls, girls!

280
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,101
Take it back right now!

281
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,645
Hello, girls.

282
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,647
Lovely morning, isn't it?

283
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,775
- Take it back! Take it back, Madge!
- Mother!

284
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,654
Take it back! Girls, what
will the neighbors say?

285
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,407
Nobody can call me goon
and get by with it.

286
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,909
You've called her worse names.

287
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,537
It doesn't hurt,
what names I call her.

288
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,082
Madge is the pretty one.
Names don't bother her at all.

289
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,295
Poor Millie.

290
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,925
Hmph. All I ever hear is "poor Millie."

291
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,304
And "poor Millie" won herself
a scholarship for four years of college.

292
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,352
A girl like Millie can need
confidence in other ways.

293
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,237
Madge,

294
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:25,783
with Alan, you'd live in comfort
the rest of your life.

295
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,663
Charge accounts at all the stores.

296
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,124
Automobiles and trips.

297
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,127
And you'd belong to the country club.

298
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,463
Mom,

299
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,715
I don't feel right with those people.

300
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,801
Why not?

301
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,721
Your grandfather
was in the state legislature.

302
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,098
You're as good as they are.

303
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,893
And when a girl's as pretty as
you are, she doesn't have to...

304
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,895
Oh, Mom.

305
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,564
What good is it just to be pretty?

306
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,944
What a question!

307
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,448
Maybe I get tired
of only being looked at.

308
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,076
You puzzle me when you talk that way.

309
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,836
Madge, does Alan ever make love?

310
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,091
Sometimes we park the car by the river.

311
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,678
Do you... Do you let him kiss you?

312
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,014
After all, you've been
going together all summer.

313
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,058
Of course I let him.

314
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,941
Does he ever want to go beyond kissing?

315
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:44,362
Oh, Mom! Well, I'm your
mother, for heaven's sakes!

316
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,906
These things have to be talked about.

317
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,706
Do you like it when he kisses you?

318
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,875
Yes.

319
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,711
You don't sound very enthusiastic.

320
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,755
What do you expect me to do?

321
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,133
Pass out every time
Alan puts his arms around me?

322
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,553
No, you don't have to pass out.

323
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,222
But there won't be many more
opportunities like the picnic tonight.

324
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,100
And it seems to me you could at least...

325
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,687
What? Oh, nothing. Nothing.

326
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,483
That dress is to be worn
only to parties, understand?

327
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,485
I don't want to have to remind you.

328
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,988
And another thing.

329
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,491
I want you to stop
picking on Millie all the time!

330
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,670
Madge!

331
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,050
Poor darling.

332
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,177
Oh, don't.

333
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,640
Mom?

334
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,060
Do you love Millie more than me?

335
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,897
Oh, Madge. Madge, of course not.

336
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,195
But sometimes you act like you did.

337
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,282
Don't say things like that.

338
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,409
Listen to me.

339
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,996
When you were born,

340
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,041
we didn't know
how to hold in ourjoy.

341
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,377
We laughed and... we cried.

342
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,674
We planted that elm tree
in the backyard.

343
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,970
When you got a little older, your father
used to carry you on his shoulder...

344
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,556
for all the neighborhood to see.

345
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,561
And when Millie came,

346
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,730
it was different.

347
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,984
Your father wasn't home
a lot of the time.

348
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,904
He found other things.

349
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,659
And then he walked out of the house
and never came back.

350
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,620
Oh, Madge.

351
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,499
If I ever seem to favor Millie,

352
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,752
maybe it's because
I want to make it up to her...

353
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,005
all those golden years
you had and she didn't.

354
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,558
I was just remembering you at school.

355
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,937
How you always had things under control.

356
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,939
Who, me?

357
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,024
Yeah.

358
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,694
Never cut classes,

359
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,613
understood the lectures,

360
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,032
took notes.

361
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,077
The hero of the campus,
and he envied me.

362
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,996
Yeah, big hero.

363
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,207
Between the goalposts.

364
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,547
Finally happened, kid.

365
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,841
Your father?
Yeah.

366
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,844
He went on his last bender.

367
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,765
Police scraped him up off the sidewalk,

368
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,059
and he died in jail.

369
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,479
I'm sorry to hear that, Hal.

370
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,025
Well, you wanted to see 'em.

371
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:13,154
There they are.
Wow!

372
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:25,499
Mr. Benson!

373
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,501
Hello, Mike!

374
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,798
You're not workin' today?
Have to!

375
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,009
Got a backlog!

376
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,303
Come on.

377
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,312
They're loadin'.

378
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,231
What d'you say there, Red?
Hello, Alan.

379
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,112
Wheat comes down
through that spout.

380
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,740
All the way from the top.

381
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,201
Yeah? It must
come down like a bat...

382
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,495
Yeah, it does. Come on.

383
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,497
I'll give you a hand, Red.

384
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,707
Thanks, I can use a hand.

385
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,711
Tie it up good, now.

386
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,464
If these things ever get loose,
they can be pretty mean.

387
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,758
I worked with the boys
here one summer.

388
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,885
I was a wheat scooper.
No kiddin'?

389
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,763
Dad wanted me to learn the business
from the bottom up.

390
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,265
I guess that'll hold it.

391
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,937
All set? Okay. Ready to go.

392
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,606
Watch this. I'll push the button.

393
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,324
Hi, Alan. What d'ya say?
How're you doin'?

394
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,368
Charlie?
Hi.

395
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,249
What's this thing?
A man-lift.

396
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,297
Go on. Get on it.
Go on! Don't be afraid!

397
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,762
Hey, this is great!
Watch your head!

398
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,641
Whoa!

399
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,279
You own all these?
Well, the corporation does.

400
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,408
That one too?
Yeah.

401
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,119
That's their newest one.
That holds ten million bushels.

402
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,872
That's a lot of biscuits.

403
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,542
You know, uh, what I was
hoping was that...

404
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,669
you and your old man,

405
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,922
between you, might be able
to fix me up with a job.

406
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:40,426
Sure. These companies
can always use men.

407
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,888
I'll talk to Dad.
I'm sure he can do something.

408
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,056
Maybe, uh,

409
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,268
somethin' in a nice office
where I can wear a tie...

410
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:53,564
and have a sweet little secretary...

411
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,234
and talk over the telephone about...

412
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,821
enterprises... and things.

413
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:07,578
I gotta get someplace in this world.
I just gotta.

414
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:11,916
Sure. But, uh,

415
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,794
before you get to be president
of the company, you'll have to be...

416
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,838
a little patient.

417
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,177
Yeah, that's somethin'
I gotta learn. Patience!

418
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,474
Come on.
Where are we goin'?

419
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,644
We're goin' swimmin'.
With a couple of girls.

420
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,687
Couple of girls?
Wait till you see mine.

421
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,689
She is unbelievable.

422
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,691
I know. Her name's Madge.

423
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,054
Absolutely and positively
the cutest thing I ever saw.

424
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,183
Ho!

425
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,185
Oh, he's all right.

426
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,187
"All right"?

427
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,774
Imagine him on a cold
and rainy night.

428
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:22,361
He's going to the picnic
with Alan, and he's, uh, taking me.

429
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,030
He's taking you?
Oh, gee!

430
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,867
Madge.

431
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,997
After the picnic tonight,

432
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,541
let's get away from the others.

433
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,627
All right.

434
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,422
We'll take a boat out on the river.

435
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,720
Come on, kid.
Let's show 'em how to swim.

436
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,765
Okay. On your mark, get set, go!

437
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,605
Come on, kid. Let's show 'em how to swim.

438
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,191
Big shot.

439
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,903
Oh, Bomber,
don't be forever a creep.

440
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:11,118
I want to find out something.

441
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:15,539
I want to find out
if you look real in the moonlight.

442
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,709
Alan, don't say that.
Why not?

443
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,711
Because I'm real, all right.

444
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,923
It doesn't matter whether you are or not.

445
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,177
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

446
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,117
- Benson?
- Yeah?

447
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,411
What's on your mind?

448
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,915
I don't know if it's such a good idea,
me goin' on this picnic.

449
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,168
Why not? You're takin' Millie.

450
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,589
Well, I... I never been on a picnic.

451
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,716
What are you talking about?

452
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,844
Everybody's been on a picnic.
Not me.

453
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,263
When I was a kid,
I was too busy shootin' craps...

454
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,265
or stealin' milk bottles.

455
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,063
You went on the steak fries
in the fraternity, didn't you?

456
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,899
Yeah, and you know
what they turned out to be.

457
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,570
Well, this picnic
won't be that primitive.

458
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,073
How do you talk to boys?

459
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,743
You just talk, silly.

460
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:42,292
Well... But... How do you
think of things to say?

461
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,796
You just say whatever
comes into your head.

462
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,507
Supposing nothing comes into my head?

463
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,969
Why ask me all the questions?

464
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,513
You're supposed to be the smart one.

465
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,557
What do you think of her?

466
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,561
Who?

467
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,563
My girl.

468
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,984
Oh! Not bad.

469
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,863
"Not bad"? She's
the prettiest girl in town.

470
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:15,117
I bet you they announce tonight
she's gonna be queen of Neewollah.

471
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,620
Nee-what-a? Neewollah!

472
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,248
Neewollah!

473
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,003
It's Halloween spelled backwards.

474
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,423
They have this
big coronation ceremony every year.

475
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,342
Madge should have been queen last year.
She had 400 votes.

476
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,012
Only this otherjerk...
Millie, stop it!

477
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:39,975
What have we been
talkin' about? I don't know.

478
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,728
Kid, you better get away from this wall.
You're liable to get educated.

479
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,771
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

480
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,944
Millie, stop it. I can't see anything.

481
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,284
We brought home your wayward girl,
Mrs. Owens.

482
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,663
Welcome back, Irma.
Rosemary told me you've been in New York.

483
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,666
Whatever she says,
I didn't disgrace myself.

484
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,586
Oh, Mrs. Owens,

485
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,713
this is Christine Schoenwalder.

486
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,133
She's taking
Mabel Fremont's place this year.

487
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:17,346
- In Feminine Hygiene.
- I'm delighted to know you, Christine.

488
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,850
- Howard phoned.
- He did?

489
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:28,857
Madge? Madge, uh, how do I look?

490
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,692
Tell me the truth!

491
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,654
You look very nice.

492
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,699
Well, feel sort of funny, though.

493
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,285
You think he'll like me?
Oh, I don't really care, anyway.

494
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,454
I just wonder.

495
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,831
Bye.
Bye, kids.

496
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,464
You better hurry if you're going to
change. Howard'll be here soon.

497
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:57,177
Shoot. It doesn't take me
any time to dress for Howard.

498
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,399
Hey, Hal! Here.

499
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,693
Try this.

500
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,530
Can you imagine that?
Alan's brought two cars.

501
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,659
Here's your date, Millie.

502
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:24,454
Hey, kid! Look at you! Well!

503
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,957
I've decided to go along too.

504
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,959
My best girl!

505
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,045
Say, Romeo, you've met
Mrs. Owens too, you know.

506
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,548
Oh, sure. She's the mother.

507
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,550
I'm coming too, Rosemary.

508
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,511
Oh, uh, this is Miss Rosemary Sydney, Hal.

509
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,722
Miss Sydney teaches in the high school.

510
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,642
Yes. I'm an old-maid
schoolteacher.

511
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,395
I have every respect
for schoolteachers, ma'am.

512
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,356
It's a lot of hard work
and not much pay.

513
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,693
Now if the men will start
taking the baskets out to the cars...

514
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,446
There's a big tub of ice,
but I don't think anybody could...

515
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,324
I'll handle that, ma'am!
I'll help.

516
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,327
Be careful. It's very heavy.

517
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,331
Here we go.
Look at him.

518
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,209
He carries that old washtub
as if it was so much tissue paper.

519
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,255
Oh, here. Let me help.

520
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:21,053
It's him.
It's him!

521
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,055
It's him!
Who?

522
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,267
Oh. It's Howard.

523
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,732
If he's been drinking,
I'm not going with him.

524
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,734
Hold it, Hal.

525
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,819
I want you to meet Howard Bevans.
Hal Carter.

526
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,031
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Same here, Hal.

527
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,950
Hey! Millie's a good-lookin' little lady.

528
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,952
I never realized that before.

529
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,830
Yuck!
He's right, kid.

530
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,916
I've been telling her
that for years. Yeah?

531
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,754
Is there anything else, ma'am?
Thermoses.

532
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,882
Thermoses! Thermoses comin' up!

533
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,510
Uh, Howard, I'm going along too.

534
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,888
That's fine. Howdy, ladies.
Hello, Howard.

535
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,890
Mrs. Owens.

536
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,267
Alan, I think you'd better hurry Madge up.

537
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,062
Yes, ma'am. Say, Delilah!

538
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,189
Go on up. Coming!

539
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:20,320
You... You sure look nice, Rosemary.

540
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:27,119
Seems to me you might at least
have left your coat on.

541
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,539
It's still too darn hot,
even if it is September.

542
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,750
How are things
across the river, Howard?

543
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,211
Oh, business is fine.

544
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,172
Back to school...
everybody's buyin'.

545
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,218
Oh, bride and groom!

546
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,763
Everybody, look! Bride and groom!

547
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:55,856
Madge, it's a picnic.
Why did you wear that dress?

548
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,319
I don't know, Mom,
I... I just put it on.

549
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,991
Hello.

550
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,620
I never could wear
another fella's clothes.

551
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:15,750
You see, I'm kinda
beefy through the shoulders.

552
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,295
I should have all
my clothes tailor-made.

553
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,673
Nobody'd mind if you took it off.
Yeah, look at me.

554
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,259
Eh, Rosemary?

555
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,261
Ah, sure.

556
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:32,392
Nothing like bein' loose!

557
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,146
We'd better hurry. All the tables...
Yeah, come on!

558
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,609
Kid, I'll race you to the car.
Roger!

559
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,694
On your marks...
On my mark.

560
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,696
Get set...
Set.

561
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,032
Go!
Go, go, go! Hey!

562
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,042
Ready?
Ready.

563
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,673
See ya there!

564
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,934
Howard?

565
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,198
How did a boy like that
ever get into college?

566
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,034
On a football scholarship.

567
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,703
But he was in your fraternity.

568
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,123
Don't those boys have a...
a little more breeding?

569
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:44,172
Maybe. But fraternities
like to pledge big athletes.

570
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:48,343
Hal could have been an All-American.
All-American?

571
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,554
If he'd only studied.

572
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,014
He flunked out his third year.

581
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:19,040

way he bragged and swaggered, either.

582
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,669
Then we shared a room,
and I got to know him better.

583
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,047
Is he wild?

584
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,926
Not really.

585
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,928
Does he drink?

586
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,055
A little.

587
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,392
After all, Millie's only a child...
Now, Flo.

588
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,021
Don't be an old poke.

589
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,190
A picnic isn't a picnic
without a little drink.

590
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,864
Howard, put that bottle down
where you found it.

591
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,161
Old poke. Old poke.

592
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,249
What if somebody saw us
from the school board?

593
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,169
I'd lose my job.

594
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,380
Now, honey, why do you think
I drove down this street?

595
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,926
There isn't a soul in sight.

596
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,311
Come on, honey. Be a sport.

597
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:25,482
Have one little one. Just for me?

598
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,652
If I have one, will you stop coaxing?

599
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,695
Yeah.

600
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,541
Just the same, you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

601
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,601
Oh, kids, that looks like a lovely spot.

602
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,563
Yes, that's just fine.

603
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,074

He says he has no name.

No, no, ladies. You've got to have a man.

I've got one!

632
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,966
And it is proper that this holiday...

633
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,260
known as Labor Day, be set aside...

634
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,892
Hey, Hal, look at the mutt!

635
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,987
No, no, no! Leave room for the cake.

636
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,741
I've never had so much fun
since Grandma caught...

637
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,369
Since... Since ever.

638
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,747
How 'bout it, kid?

639
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,751
We'd have won that three-legged race
if I hadn't let you down.

640
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,422
Millie doesn't go in much for sports.
She cultivates her mind.

641
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,551
Oh, I... I wasn't taking anything away
from her there, ma'am.

642
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,095
She's got a splendid mind.

643
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,100
Oh, come on,
both of you. Cut it out.

644
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:38,104
You ought to come over
to Halstor someday and see my shop.

645
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,982
Notions, novelties, school supplies.

646
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,984
You too, Alan.

647
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,445
It's right across the big river.

648
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,447
We'll be over, sir,

649
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,116
as soon as we can fit it
in our schedule.

650
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,327
You can't miss it.
The store right next to the bank.

651
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,329
I live right upstairs.

652
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:59,042
Only one big room, but it's big enough
for me and my 21 -inch TV.

653
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,547
Where'd you ever get those boots?

654
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,633
My old man left them to me when he died.

655
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,303
He had a very big foot.

656
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:14,223
Is that all he left you,
just a pair of boots?

657
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:18,936
He used to sit down on the bed at night,
and I'd tug 'em off him.

658
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,272
And he'd say,

659
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:25,818
"Son, the man of the house
has got to have a pair of boots...

660
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,155
'cause he's gotta do a lot of kickin'."

661
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,455
Then he said, uh,

662
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:41,375
"Son, there'll be times
when the only thing...

663
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,088
"you've got to be proud of is
the fact that you're a man.

664
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,256
"So wear your boots so people
know you're comin',

665
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,843
and keep your fist doubled up so they know
you mean business when you get there."

666
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,887
My old man, he was a corker.

667
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,349
Hal's always so shy of people
before he meets them,

668
00:48:56,433 --> 00:49:00,228
and then you can't keep him still.

669
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:04,107
What line of business you in, son?

670
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,360
I'm about to, uh,
enter the grain business, sir.

671
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,031
You see, uh,

672
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,618
my old man was no aristocratic
millionaire or anything,

673
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:19,789
but he had some very important friends.

674
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:23,459
Some very big people, in their own way.

675
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:27,130
And one of them was always after me...

676
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:31,467
to take this position
with the oil company down in Texas and...

677
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:35,054
Dad and I found a place
for Hal scooping wheat.

678
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,767
Yeah, I've decided
to start from the very bottom.

679
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,940
I sure do appreciate Alan
and his old...

680
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:50,361
His old father
giving me this opportunity.

681
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:56,659
A young man coming to town
has got to be a good mixer.

682
00:49:56,743 --> 00:50:00,872
Wouldn't it be nice if he could join
the country club and play golf?

683
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,125
He won't be able to afford that.

684
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,794
The bowling team's a rowdy gang.

685
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,258
There's a young men's Bible
class at the Baptist church.

686
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,221
I learned something today.

687
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:20,975
And it's that... Well, there
comes a time in a man's life...

688
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,437
when he's gotta quit
rollin' around like a pinball.

689
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,859
Maybe a...

690
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:33,029
a little town like this is the, uh,

691
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,865
place to settle down,

692
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:40,870
where people are easygoin'
and sincere.

693
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:46,834
Hi.

694
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,469
Hey!

695
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,768
Well, I... I'm sorry.

696
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,981

when I was a girl.

707
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,087
Things I haven't thought about...

00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,257
in a long, long time.

709
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,259
Now, Helen.

710
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,804
Flo,

711
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:26,767
you'll never know what it's meant
to have you next door to me.

712
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,355
Watching your two girls grow up.

713
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,233
It's made it easier.
Now, Helen.

714
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:41,407
Where is everybody?

715
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,868
Don't you remember, Flo?

716
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:48,080
At a picnic, everybody disappears.

717
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,757
Look at that sunset, Howard.

718
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,427
A sunset's a beautiful thing, all right.

719
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,514
It's like the daytime
didn't want to end, isn't it?

720
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,435
It's like the daytime
was gonna put up a big scrap,

721
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,564
set the world on fire,

722
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,108
to keep the nighttime
from creeping on.

723
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,547
Hey, kid.

724
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,633
It's me!

725
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,719
I had a job as a model once.

726
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:46,514
Like this.

727
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,725
They had me posing in front
of their class almost raw.

728
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,234
I sure do admire people who are artistic.

729
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,277
Oh, I just like to draw.

730
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:05,366
People who draw,

731
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,411
read books,

732
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,705
listen to the... better music.

733
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,255
I used to go with a girl who read books.

734
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,842
She joined the, uh,
Book of the Month Club,

735
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,387
and they had her reading books
all the time.

736
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:30,015
She'd no more'n finish one
and they'd shoot her another.

737
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:42,570
Last summer I memorized
all of Shakespeare's sonnets.

738
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,697

Yeah. I, uh...

743
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,678
I was thinking how impressed he'll be
when he reads you were...

744
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,722
picked as queen of Neewollah tonight.

745
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,641
They haven't picked me yet.

746
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,727
Besides,

747
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:18,481
I'm sure he thinks
the whole thing is silly.

748
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,983
No, you don't know him.

749
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:24,820
He's always impressed
by people who win things, or...

750
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:29,033
make the most money, or...

751
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:32,203

752
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,715
I write poetry myself.

753
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,929
I've written poems
I've never shown to a living soul.

Kid, I think you must be
some sort of a genius.

We're all going down
to the dock in a minute. Now, remember.

Oh, yes.

and I'll try hard to be a good queen.

I'm no good at dancing.

804
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:40,195
Oh, that's just what you men say
to get out of it.

805
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:44,032
We'll show you we can do without them,
won't we, Millie? Come on.

806
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,120

Excuse me.

01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,975
Where's Mrs. Johnson?
I've got to return this cape.

01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,185
Excuse me a minute, Mom?

811
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,230

Hey, kid, dance with me.

815
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,606
I've never danced with boys.
Oh, sure you can.

816
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:01,193

All you have to do is follow the steps.

Ahh. Kid, I'll show you
a step I learned in L.A.

821
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,540
Now watch this.

822
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,585

Aren't they graceful?

825
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:30,569
You used to dance like that, Flo.

826
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:17,699
Why can't you dance that way?

827
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:20,827
Golly, honey, I'm a businessman.

828
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:28,710
One night I went dancing
at a big Valentine party.

829
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:32,214
I danced so hard I swooned.

830
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:36,426
That's when they called me
the dancing fool.

831
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,720
Mighty pretty legs.

832
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:41,056
Aw, that's just like you men.

833
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,434
Can't talk about anything
but women's legs.

834
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:47,395
I just noticed they had a nice shape.

835
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,067
How would you like it if we women went
around talking about your legs all the time?

836
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:54,903
All right. Here's my legs.

837
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,661
I never saw anything so ugly!

838
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:08,333
Young man, let's see your legs!
Oh, no, w-wait!

839
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,710
No, no, no. New rule tonight.
Every man here's got to show his legs.

840
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,088
No, no. Come on. Come on.
The other one too.

841
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,590
Let him alone.
He's dancing with Madge.

842
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:19,886
It's his turn to dance with me. I may be an old
schoolteacher, but I can keep up with you.

843
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:22,138
Come on. Ride 'em, cowboy.

844
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,641
But ma'am, I...

845
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:29,604
Used to have a boyfriend was a cowboy.
Met him in Colorado.

846
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:35,318
He was in love with me because I was
an older woman and had some sense.

847
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,737
Oh. Sorry.

848
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:42,450
He took me up in the mountains one
night and wanted to marry me.

849
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,578
Right there on the mountaintop.

850
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:50,333
He said the stars'd be our preacher
and the moon our best man.

851
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:53,253
Did you ever hear such talk?

852
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,632
You know what?

853
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:01,928
You remind me of one of those old statues.

854
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:05,432
One of those Roman gladiators.

855
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:09,060
All they had on was a shield.

856
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,771
Look, ma'am, I don't... My, those
ancient people were depraved.

857
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,399
I don't think I can dance, ma'am.
I can keep up with you.

858
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,319
Please. I want to dance. Please dance
with me. Please. I gotta dance.

859
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,863
Please!

860
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,334
He was dancing with Madge.
Now let him alone. They're young people.

861
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,462
Young? What do you mean,
they're young?

862
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,757
Oh, Millie!

863
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,343
Millie! Millie!

864
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,553
Oh, I'm sick.

865
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,683
Oh, I just want to die.

866
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,519
Here, Millie. Over here, darling.

867
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:54,939
I hate you!
Millie!

868
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:59,986
Madge is the pretty one.
Madge is the pretty one.

869
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:04,115
What did she have to do that for?

870
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,328
I guess that's something wonderful: Young.

871
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,956
How much do you suppose the little
dickens... Who fed liquor to Millie?

872
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,086
He did, Mrs. Owens. It's all his fault.

873
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,839
- Wait a minute, Rosemary. Mrs. Owens, it was this way...
- Millie was your date.

874
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:24,469
You should've been looking after her, but
you were too busy making eyes at Madge.

875
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:28,223
Rosemary! Mrs. Owens,
the boy didn't do anything.

876
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,851
You've been stomping around here
in those boots like you own the place,

877
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,813
thinking every woman you saw
was going to fall madly in love.

878
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,732
Well, here's one woman
didn't pay you any mind.

879
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:40,985
Bragging about your father.

880
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,738
I'll bet he wasn't any better'n you are,
strutting around here...

881
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,865
like some crummy Apollo!

882
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:50,537
You thinkjust 'cause you act young, you can walk
in here and make off with whatever you like.

883
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:56,042
Let me tell you something.
You're a fake.

884
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:59,921
You're no jive kid.
You're just scared to act your age.

885
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:03,341
Buy yourself a mirror sometime and take
a look in it. Won't be many years now...

886
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,177
before you're counting
the gray hairs, if you've got any left.

887
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,389
And what'll become of you then?
You'll end your life in the gutter,

888
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:14,144
and it'll serve you right, 'cause the gutter's
where you came from and where you belong!

889
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:19,232
Rosemary, shut your mouth!

890
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,743
Turn that off!
This isn't a sideshow!

891
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:34,497
Go on! Go on about your business!

892
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:38,293
Go on! Go on about your business!
Go on! Get out of here!

893
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,962
What happened? Turn
off that light, I said.

894
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:44,507
What happened, Hal?

895
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,389
I...

896
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:54,392
Answer me! What did you do?

897
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,645
Same old Hal.

898
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,107
I'm sorry, Mrs. Owens.

899
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:04,402
I should've known better
than to trust him.

900
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:14,412
I want it understood
there's to be no more drinking!

901
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,499
It was my fault, Mrs. Owens.

902
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,168
I brought the whiskey.

903
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:23,338
Alan, come and help me with Millie.

904
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:43,316
What made me do it, Howard?
What made me act that way?

905
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,322
Maybe it's the...

906
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:51,783
the harvest moon, honey.

907
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:57,497
I wanted to have
a good time tonight, Howard.

908
01:12:57,581 --> 01:13:00,708
This is my last night of vacation.

909
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:03,628
Maybe we should go for a ride, honey.

910
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,923
Yes. Yes, let's!

911
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:12,804
Yes. I want to have a good time.
I want to have a good time!

912
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:35,159
Beat it, baby. I'm in a pretty bad mood.
Please wait a minute.

913
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,830
Alan shouldn't
have talked that way to you.

914
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,833
I said "beat it"!

915
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,799
Okay, baby. You asked for it.

916
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:30,214
Okay. Go on home.
Tell them anything you want.

917
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:32,800
And thank Benson for his shirt.
What are you going to do?

918
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,219
There'll be a freight along here soon.

919
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:02,121
Women like Miss Sydney
make me mad at the whole female sex.

920
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:08,252
What's the use, baby? I'm a bum.

921
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:12,965
She saw through me
like an X-ray machine.

922
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,802
There's no place in the world
for a guy like me.

923
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:20,139
Oh, but there's got to be.
Look. Don't pay any attention to her.

924
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:23,017
You are young.

925
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:27,105
Yes, you are.

926
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:30,274
But not so young
you're not a man too.

927
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,362
And you're very entertaining.

928
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:37,448
Why, I think you say all sorts
of witty things.

929
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,451
I just love listening to you talk.

930
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,747
And you're a wonderful dancer.

931
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:46,749
Thanks.

932
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:49,836
I can tell a lot about a man
by dancing with him.

933
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,879
You know, some boys,

934
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,590
when they take a girl
in their arms to dance, they...

935
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,636
Well, they make her feel
sort of uncomfortable.

936
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,557
But with you, I...

937
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:06,269
I had the feeling you knew
exactly what you were doing.

938
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,897
And I could follow you
every step of the way.

939
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:13,568
Why, you've got lots of qualities.

940
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:18,448
Let me level with you, baby.
When I was 14, I spent a year in jail.

941
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:24,036
Honest? Called it a reform school.
Let me tell you, it was a jail.

942
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,038
For what?

943
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:31,419
I stole another guy's motorcycle.

944
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:36,591
I stole it because I wanted to get so far
away so fast, nobody'd ever catch up with me.

945
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:39,719
Everybody feels that way sometimes.

946
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:45,641
Then my old lady
went to the authorities.

947
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:49,979
"I've done everything I can with the boy.
I can't do anything more."

948
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:54,484
So off I go to that lousy, stinkin' place!

949
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,652
Gee.

950
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:59,489
When I finally get out...

951
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,285
the old lady's sorry to see me back...

952
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:07,121
'cause...

953
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:10,291
my dad's loaded all the time and...

954
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:14,253
she's got a new boyfriend
and I'm in the way.

955
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:19,550
It's awful when parents
don't get along.

956
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:25,014
Well, there you are.
And I never told that to another soul.

957
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:29,060
So if you want to faint or get sick or go
home to Mama, go on, because I'm not gonna...

958
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,864
Baby, what'd you do?

959
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:47,578
I get so tired of
just being told I'm pretty.

960
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:15,189
The others... We've got
to get back to the picnic.

961
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,905
Do we?

962
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:13,664
Well, here we are, honey,
right back where we started from.

963
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:24,342
Everybody else must be home hours.

964
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,679
I'm glad we went off.

965
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,769
Good night, Rosemary.

966
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:38,564
Maybe I should say "good morning."

967
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:41,192
Where are you going, Howard?

968
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,571
Why, home, honey.

969
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:48,282
You can't go off without me.

970
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,993
Not after tonight.

971
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:53,037
Take me with you.

972
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,333
Honey, be reasonable.
What would people say?

973
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:00,962
People? What do people say
if I thumb my nose at 'em?

974
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,756
What do people say if I walk down the
street and showed 'em my pink panties?

975
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,843
- What do I care what people say?
- Rosemary. Look, honey.

976
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:11,055
You'd better go inside
and get some sleep.

977
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:14,892
You gotta start school
in the morning.

978
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,855
Can't we talk this over on Saturday?

979
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,859
Maybe you won't be back Saturday.

980
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:27,655
Rosemary,
you know better than that.

981
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:30,825
Maybe you won't be back ever again.

982
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:37,707
You're not yourself tonight.

983
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,459
Yes, I am.

984
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,796
I'm more myself than I ever was.

985
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,049
I see what's in store for me.

986
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:50,845
After you, someone else.

987
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:54,557
Then... someone else.

988
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:57,685
Then... Take me with you, Howard.

989
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:01,105
If you don't, I don't know
what I'll do with myself. I mean it.

990
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:09,572
When we first started to go together,
you were the best sport I ever saw.

991
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:13,075
Always good for a laugh.

992
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,494
I can't laugh anymore.

993
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:19,290
You said you were going
to marry me, Howard.

994
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:22,168
You said when I got back from my vacation,
you'd be waiting with the preacher.

995
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:25,880
Honey, I had a busy summer. Where is
the preacher, Howard? Where is he?

996
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,807
I'm not a boy anymore.

997
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,103
A person forms certain ways of living,

998
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:44,732
and one day it's too late to change.

999
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:49,528
I'm no spring chicken, either.

1000
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:52,698
Maybe I'm a little older than you think.

1001
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:57,244
My ways are formed too,

1002
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:00,581
but they can be changed.

1003
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:03,167
They gotta be changed.

1004
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,296
It's no good living like this...

1005
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,548
in... rented rooms.

1006
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:15,179
Meeting a bunch of old maids
for supper every night.

1007
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:22,436
Then coming back home... alone.

1008
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:30,194
Each year,
I keep telling myself it's the last.

1009
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:33,697
Something'll happen.

1010
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:36,867
Nothing ever does.

1011
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,788
Except I get a little crazier
all the time.

1012
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,917
Well... A well's a hole
in the ground, Howard.

1013
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,796
I wasn't trying to be funny,
Rosemary.

1014
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:57,012
Can't we talk this over on Saturday?
I'm dead tired.

1015
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:03,561
I got a busy week ahead of me.

1016
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,480
You gotta marry me, Howard.

1017
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:09,316
I can't marry you now.

1018
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:12,027
You can be over in the morning.

1019
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:30,379
No.

1020
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:35,009
I'm not going to marry anyone who says,
"You gotta marry me, Howard."

1021
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,679
I mean, the thing is,

1022
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:45,102
if a woman wants me to marry her,
she can at least say "please."

1023
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:50,774
Please marry me, Howard.

1024
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,864
Please.

1025
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,075
Please.

1026
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,454
Rosemary.

1027
01:24:04,664 --> 01:24:07,458
Come on inside.

1028
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,377
Go to bed, honey,
and get some sleep.

1029
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,922
I'll drive over in the morning.

1030
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:15,841
Maybe we can talk it over.

1031
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:19,386
Don't come unless
you're taking me away, Howard.

1032
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:27,478
Please marry me, Howard.
Please.

1033
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:30,397
Go to bed, honey.
Get some sleep.

1034
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:36,362
Please.

1035
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,158
How will you get in?

1036
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:26,203
The kitchen door's always open.

1037
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,877
Are you all right, baby?

1038
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,380
Yes, I'm all right.

1039
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:41,802
If I thought I'd done anything
to make you unhappy,

1040
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,930
I'd almost want to die.

1041
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:48,058
Helen! Helen!

1042
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:52,146
Yes, Mama. I'm coming.

1043
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:03,490
You'd better go.

1044
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:07,995
I'll take the car
back to Benson's house.

1045
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:12,666
Wow, I didn't even think of him
until this second.

1046
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:16,003
I oughta be shot at sunrise.

1047
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:20,966
I guess neither of us
thought too much about anything.

1048
01:26:24,637 --> 01:26:27,181
Well, good night.

1049
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:29,350
When'll I see you?

1050
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,769
I don't know.

1051
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,730
What time are you through
at the dime store?

1052
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,233
At 6:00. Well, maybe I
could come by then...

1053
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:46,116
Hey, I... I start a job tomorrow.

1054
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,787
Do you?

1055
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,956
No. Maybe not with Benson.

1056
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,168
Someplace.

1057
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:03,467
You don't mind seeing a guy who's...

1058
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:08,055
just a grain scooper, do you?

1059
01:27:08,139 --> 01:27:10,140
Of course not.

1060
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,360
Baby, would you kiss me good night?

1061
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:24,905
No.

1062
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:28,033
Just once, f-for luck maybe, huh?

1063
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:31,829
If I promise not to hold you?
No.

1064
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:36,166
You're trying to punish me, Madge.

1065
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:41,797
Yes.

1066
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:44,842
Oh, yes, I...

1067
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,970
I think I was trying to punish you.

1068
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,598
Oh, kiss me, Hal.

1069
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,652
Being with you is wonderful, baby.

1070
01:28:03,736 --> 01:28:05,863
You make me feel...

1071
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,782
important.

1072
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,826
No!

1073
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:16,874
You make me feel... patient.

1074
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:26,008
Do I?

1075
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:39,021
Don't kiss me anymore.
Oh, please don't kiss me anymore.

1076
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:36,620
It's all right. I put Mom to bed.

1077
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,255
Madge... I was awful tonight, wasn't I?

1078
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:56,765
Honest. I'm never going to touch another
drink till the day I die.

1079
01:30:31,467 --> 01:30:34,928
And so far, no go.
We've notified the highway patrol.

1080
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:38,473
You've had hours. Look, can't we all go
to bed and worry about this tomorrow?

1081
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,435
After all, it's only a stolen car.
It's not!

1082
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:44,521
What about Madge?
Maybe he kidnapped her.

1083
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:49,860
Nobody kidnapped her.
She's home.

1084
01:30:52,071 --> 01:30:55,657
You got every right to be sore, Benson,
but so help me, I didn't start out to...

1085
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:58,994
You saw another pretty girl,
and you had to add her to your list.

1086
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,204
It wasn't that way at all.
No matter what you think...

1087
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,832
You're a liar!

1088
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:08,086
Alan, you're... you're the only friend
I ever had. I wouldn't...

1089
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:10,088
I'm not your friend anymore!

1090
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:14,801
Why, you... Let me go, you bum!

1091
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,054
You no-good hobo!

1092
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:24,353
When I think how glad
I was to see you this morning...

1093
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:26,897
how glad I was...

1094
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:31,109
I want him arrested.
He stole my car.

1095
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:36,031
That's a lousy lie, kid. The car's right
outside. It doesn't matter. He stole it.

1096
01:31:36,115 --> 01:31:38,784
We'll book you for the night, bub.
You got no place to sleep anyway.

1097
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:41,161
Come on. I'm not
going to anyjail.

1098
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:43,914
No damn jail, see?

1099
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:49,461
It wasn't the car. Tell him.

1100
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:55,050
Tell him it's not the car!
Tell him it's because of Madge!

1101
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:14,820
Thanks, kid.

1102
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:21,243
Why don't you boys let him go?
Nobody's going to push us...

1103
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:56,027
Let's go to bed, Son.

1104
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:59,072
Don't pretend you're not pleased about
this. What are you talking about?

1105
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:02,784
Madge and me! You wanted to break this
up, and you thought it would do it!

1106
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:06,580
Well, it won't! I'm going to marry Madge,
so start getting used to the idea!

1107
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:13,920
I hope he gets away.

1108
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:53,752
Over here! He went over this way!

1109
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:24,616
You check the freight cars.
I'll search the riverbank.

1110
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:17,294
Have to have at least
one more easy chair.

1111
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:21,381
What about the closets?

1112
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,801
Barely enough room for my suits.

1113
01:35:28,472 --> 01:35:31,391
Slipcovers, I suppose.

1114
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,812
That'd have to go.

1115
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,862
No.

1116
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:06,927
Carter. What happened, son?

1117
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:10,805
I remember you saying
you lived next to the bank.

1118
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:14,476
The cops didn't see me
hit the river. Cops?

1119
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:21,608
I don't know. Benson said I stole his car.

1120
01:36:21,692 --> 01:36:23,818
Please, sir, you gotta help me.

1121
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:26,488
I have to spend the night someplace,
and then I gotta get out of town.

1122
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:30,617
Sure. Get out of those and dry off.

1123
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:33,578
You see, what happened was this...
You don't have to tell me.

1124
01:36:33,663 --> 01:36:36,122
I understand.

1125
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:38,667
What we need is a drink.

1126
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,672
You got your troubles,
and I got mine.

1127
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,891
You got a rag?

1128
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:56,893
Sure.

1129
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:13,576
You went for that Owens girl,
didn't you?

1130
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,250
Yeah.

1131
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:24,295
I'll admit they can get under your skin.

1132
01:37:26,882 --> 01:37:30,719
That doesn't mean we gotta take 'em
too seriously, though.

1133
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:34,347
For instance,

1134
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:38,101
you wouldn't say a man
had to go as far as marryin' 'em.

1135
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:43,106
You wouldn't say a thing
like that, would you?

1136
01:37:45,776 --> 01:37:48,278
You're not being very helpful.

1137
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:25,648
Well, were you awake when she got in?

1138
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:28,693
No, Mom.

1139
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:32,864
Didn't she say anything to
you this morning? Nothing.

1140
01:38:32,948 --> 01:38:36,618
She's still got her door locked.

1141
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:41,498
Have you been smoking?

1142
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:44,542
Oh, hi, Mrs. Potts!
Is Madge all right?

1143
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:46,753
Uh, certainly.

1144
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:49,547
She told me all about it.

1145
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:52,926
She got out of the car
and left that hoodlum alone.

1146
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:55,762
And she walked home.

1147
01:38:58,390 --> 01:39:01,101
Has anyone seen Howard?
Howard? Why, no.

1148
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:04,187
Oh, he said he might
be over this morning.

1149
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:11,277
She's been running around all morning
like a chicken with its head off.

1150
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:13,571
Something's up.

1151
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:18,576
I think a teacher
should be dressed up on the first day.

1152
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:20,662
Good morning, Mrs. Owens.
Good morning, Irma.

1153
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:22,956
Is Rosemary ready?
We promised the principal...

1154
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,834
we'd be there early
to help with registration.

1155
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,586
All set for school again, Millie?
Yep.

1156
01:39:28,671 --> 01:39:31,589
Lovely picnic, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?

1157
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:35,051
How's Madge?
Oh, just fine.

1158
01:39:37,012 --> 01:39:40,557
Come on, Christine. I bet we have
to get that sleepy girl out of bed.

1159
01:40:02,454 --> 01:40:06,457
I got to see Rosemary.
I think she's expecting me.

1160
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:10,879
You better holler at the bottom of the
stairs. The others are up there with her.

1161
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:16,467
The others? Yeah. Miss
Henderson and Schoenwalder.

1162
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:19,762
I gotta see her alone.
I gotta explain something to her.

1163
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:23,391
This is the beginning of my busy season, so I
don't think I'll be able to make any plans...

1164
01:40:23,475 --> 01:40:25,727
It's Howard! It's Howard!

1165
01:40:25,811 --> 01:40:27,979
He's come for me!

1166
01:40:28,063 --> 01:40:30,690
Howard!

1167
01:40:30,774 --> 01:40:34,027
You came back! Oh, Howard.

1168
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:36,279
Oh, girls, girls!

1169
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:39,991
Here's my man! What are
you screaming and yelling about?

1170
01:40:40,075 --> 01:40:42,452
Here's my man!
What's the matter with you?

1171
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:45,788
Wait till you hear the news! It's the
funniest thing. We're going to be married.

1172
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:48,708
No! Now,
today, this minute.

1173
01:40:48,792 --> 01:40:51,002
Howard, let me be the first...

1174
01:40:51,086 --> 01:40:53,838
Oh, don't worry, honey.
It won't take me long.

1175
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:56,758
We'll help pack. No, no, no.
Packing's almost finished.

1176
01:40:56,842 --> 01:40:59,093
I was keeping this secret.
Weren't we?

1177
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:02,639
Don't forget... You've got to
wear something old! Nylons.

1178
01:41:02,765 --> 01:41:05,850
Something new.
My new handbag.

1179
01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:08,853
Something borrowed.
Oh, thank you, Christine.

1180
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:11,856
Oh! I don't see anything blue.
What?

1181
01:41:11,941 --> 01:41:14,692
And you ain't gonna.

1182
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:17,153
Come on, Christine.
We'll put something funny in a bag!

1183
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:20,698
Madge. Madge?

1184
01:41:20,824 --> 01:41:24,077
Oh, Madge.
Congratulations, Howard.

1185
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:28,957
I know you'll be very happy, and I
want you to know that... Madge! Madge.

1186
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:32,502
I called and called.
Why didn't you answer?

1187
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:35,255
Alan phoned.

1188
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:39,676
He said to tell you he's not angry.
He knows it wasn't your fault.

1189
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,596
And then he said...
Let me get this straight...

1190
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:47,892
He said, "Tell Madge it's important.
I want to see her."

1191
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:51,187
Did you hear what I said?

1192
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:53,189
Yes.

1193
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:56,693
You ought to thank your lucky stars,
young lady.

1194
01:41:56,777 --> 01:42:02,365
Mrs. Owens! Come see this divine outfit.
We need your approval. Come on.

1195
01:42:03,575 --> 01:42:07,203
Howard? Howard,
come help us with the bags.

1196
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:11,040
He's outside.

1197
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:16,087
He's hiding in my car. The police are after
him, but he says he's got to see you.

1198
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:27,890
Be careful. Hey, Madge, I got the rice!
Let's go get some paint!

1199
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:31,227
Oh, Mrs. Potts has some! Mrs. Potts!

1200
01:42:33,188 --> 01:42:36,566
Mrs. Potts,
Miss Sydney's getting married!

1201
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:40,987
Who? Rosemary Sydney!
Let's decorate the car.

1202
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:44,615
Let's get some paint!
Oh, yes!

1203
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:48,328
...some of that rice. Christine, get some
rice. Be ready. She'll be right out.

1204
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:50,663
Tah-dah! Tah-dah!

1205
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:53,207
Tah-dah!

1206
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:56,085
Isn't this exciting?
Oh, I think I'm going to cry.

1207
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,129
Imagine something like this
the first day of school!

1208
01:42:58,255 --> 01:43:01,299
Oh, the rice is so cute!
All the happiness in the world!

1209
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:05,678
Thank you. Howard, look! The sun has come
out! You would pick a wonderful day!

1210
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:07,680
Let's go.

1211
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,766
Tin cans!

1212
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:14,062
Oh, isn't this so nice?

1213
01:43:14,146 --> 01:43:16,022
Oh, you're so sweet!

1214
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:21,486
Mrs. Potts, you've been a wonderful friend.
I wish you happiness, Rosemary.

1215
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:24,155
I mean, Mrs. Bevans.

1216
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:27,367
Wait
till we tell the principal about this!

1217
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:30,328
Ohh! Where's Madge?
Good-bye, Madge!

1218
01:43:30,412 --> 01:43:34,499
- Good-bye, Miss Sydney.
- Aww.

1219
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:37,627
And don't worry about the room, Mrs. Owens.
I know Linda Sue Breckenridge will take it.

1220
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:40,046
And she's a darling girl.

1221
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:43,883
- She sure is.
- Rosemary, we still got to pick up the license.

1222
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:48,846
I nearly forgot. I left my hot-water bottle
in the closet, my curlers in the bathroom.

1223
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:51,808
Oh, and would you be good enough to store
the rest of my things in your attic?

1224
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:53,851
Sure. Rosemary,
we'd better hurry.

1225
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:56,479
Where are we going?

1226
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:01,984
Well, I...

1227
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,862
I got a cousin who has a tourist camp
in the Ozarks, but I don't think...

1228
01:44:04,988 --> 01:44:08,032
I love the Ozarks! Wonderful
this time of year!

1229
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:11,953
I was there a few years ago for my
vacation. Get ready.

1230
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:14,914
Bye-bye!
Drive carefully!

1231
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:18,459
Have a wonderful time!
Hurry back!

1232
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:21,254
So long, girls. You know
what you can tell the principal from me.

1233
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:23,840
Bye-bye! Take care!

1234
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:30,763
Hey, kids! It's Miss Sydney.
She's getting married.

1235
01:44:30,848 --> 01:44:34,350
Hey, fellas, it's Howard Bevans!

1236
01:44:42,234 --> 01:44:45,361
Bye! Bye!

1237
01:44:49,491 --> 01:44:51,492
Hi, baby.

1238
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:55,872
I'm in a jam.
Howard told me.

1239
01:44:55,956 --> 01:45:00,042
I just couldn't run out of town
and never see you again.

1240
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:02,545
Where are you going?

1241
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:04,755
Tulsa.

1242
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:09,302
I can always get a job
at the Hotel Mayo, bell-hoppin'.

1243
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:12,889
Hey, Mom, did you see
what I put on the back of the car?

1244
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:16,309
Madge!

1245
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:19,812
- It's the young man!
- Madge!

1246
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:21,814
Mom!

1247
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:25,151
Madge, what are you... Don't blow
your top, ma'am. I'm leaving town.

1248
01:45:25,235 --> 01:45:29,655
Leaving? I thought you were
going to stay here and settle down.

1249
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:32,158
I thought so too, ma'am.

1250
01:45:36,246 --> 01:45:39,957
Aren't you going to say good-bye?
Good-bye.

1251
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:42,001
Are you mad at me?

1252
01:45:42,085 --> 01:45:44,003
No.

1253
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:49,133
I gotta know how you feel.
Last night I thought...

1254
01:45:49,259 --> 01:45:55,139
I thought you liked me. I did like you. I
liked you from the first time I saw you.

1255
01:45:55,224 --> 01:45:58,559
Madge, are you out of your senses?

1256
01:46:00,646 --> 01:46:04,023
Look, I've been thinking all night.

1257
01:46:04,107 --> 01:46:07,068
I've never said
this before because it...

1258
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:10,363
it would make me seem
like such a freak, but...

1259
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:12,365
What?

1260
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:15,451
I love you, Madge. Do you hear?

1261
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:18,371
Millie, I want you
in the house this minute.

1262
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:21,707
Do you love me? Do you?

1263
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:24,168
I'm going to call the police
and have you put where you belong.

1264
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:27,630
If you please, ma'am,
I'm catchin' that freight!

1265
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:32,009
Meet me, baby. We'll get married.

1266
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:35,888
They'll give me a room in the hotel. It'll
be okay until we find something better.

1267
01:46:36,014 --> 01:46:39,392
Oh, Madge, don't listen! Look,
baby, I got a chance with you.

1268
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:42,436
It won't be big time,
but that isn't important, is it?

1269
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:45,398
Come on.

1270
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:47,358
Oh, Hal, I can't!

1271
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:51,571
Why? Don't you see why?
Don't you?

1272
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:56,367
Listen, baby.

1273
01:46:56,451 --> 01:47:00,079
You're the only real thing
I ever wanted... ever.

1274
01:47:00,163 --> 01:47:04,417
You're mine. I've got to claim what's mine,
or I'll be nothing as long as I live.

1275
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:13,759
You love me. You know it.

1276
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:16,846
You love me! You love me!

1277
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:20,683
You love me!

1278
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:50,212
Oh, Madge.

1279
01:48:00,974 --> 01:48:02,892
You...

1280
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:07,355
You liked him, didn't you, Helen?

1281
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:09,607
Yes, I did.

1282
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:14,612
I got so used to things as they were.

1283
01:48:14,696 --> 01:48:18,991
Everything so prim.
The geranium in the window.

1284
01:48:19,076 --> 01:48:21,911
The smell of Mama's medicines.

1285
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:26,707
And then he walked in,
and it was different.

1286
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:31,003
He clomped through the place
like he was still outdoors.

1287
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:35,633
There was a man in the house,
and it seemed good.

1288
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:51,065
When I graduate from college,
I'm going to New York...

1289
01:48:51,149 --> 01:48:55,236
and write novels that'll shock people
right out of their senses.

1290
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:59,198
I'm never going to fall in love, not me.

1291
01:48:59,282 --> 01:49:03,035
I'm not going to live in some jerkwater
town and marry some ornery guy...

1292
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:06,038
and raise a lot of grimy kids.

1293
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:13,546
But just because I'm a dope,
doesn't mean you have to be.

1294
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:20,803
I was watching out the window
when you said good-bye.

1295
01:49:22,305 --> 01:49:24,265
Millie.

1296
01:49:26,143 --> 01:49:28,561
Go with him, Madge.

1297
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:30,730
Oh, Millie.

1298
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:34,483
For once in your life,
do something bright.

1299
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:45,286
♪ Ain't she sweet ♪

1300
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:48,789
♪ See her comin' down the street ♪

1301
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:56,297
Hey, Madge,
do you want to go dancing?

1302
01:49:56,381 --> 01:49:58,966
Let me be next, Madge.

1303
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:01,594
♪ Now I ask you
very confidentially ♪

1304
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,054
♪ Ain't she sweet ♪♪ Get
out of this yard! Get out!

1305
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:07,850
Neewollah! Neewollah!

1306
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,278
Madge.

1307
01:50:19,362 --> 01:50:21,864
I'm going to Tulsa, Mom.

1308
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:25,409
You don't know what
you're doing. You can't.

1309
01:50:25,535 --> 01:50:28,412
I'm going, Mom. Listen to me.
Put down that bag.

1310
01:50:28,538 --> 01:50:31,791
Listen to what I've got to say. There's
a bus coming. I've got to hurry.

1311
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:34,585
He's no good.
He'll never be able to support you.

1312
01:50:34,669 --> 01:50:39,882
When he does have a job, he'll spend it all on
drink. After that, there'll be other women.

1313
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:42,009
I know.

1314
01:50:42,093 --> 01:50:45,346
Mom, you don't love someone
because he's perfect.

1315
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:49,099
Madge. Madge,
just think about it a few days.

1316
01:50:49,184 --> 01:50:51,060
Madge.

1317
01:50:56,566 --> 01:50:58,692
Good-bye, Mrs. Potts.

1318
01:50:59,736 --> 01:51:02,655
I'll miss you almost as much as Mom.

1319
01:51:02,739 --> 01:51:07,910
Madge, look. You've got to be here
for the festival. It's your duty.

1320
01:51:08,912 --> 01:51:12,414
Alan's going to take you.

1321
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:17,086
But I don't love Alan, Mom.

1322
01:51:18,129 --> 01:51:21,048
Don't worry about me.

1323
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:26,053
Oh, Madge, my little girl.

1324
01:51:26,137 --> 01:51:30,432
My baby. Don't go. Don't. Don't.

1325
01:51:45,448 --> 01:51:48,784
But there are so many things I
meant to tell her.

1326
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:54,248
I never got around to it. Let her
learn them for herself, Flo.

1327
01:51:56,209 --> 01:51:59,670
Come on, Millie! You don't
want to be late the first day!
