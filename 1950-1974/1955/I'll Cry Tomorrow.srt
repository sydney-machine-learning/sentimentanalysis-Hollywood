1
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,489
You, the pretty little girl.
That's right, honey.

2
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,425
Thank you ever so much.
The rest of you can leave.

3
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:33,662
I could swear he was looking at you.

4
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:37,136
All the way over from 10th Avenue,
they don't even let you audition.

5
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:40,071
Least they could do is give you a chance.

6
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:45,478
Lillian, I want you to go over to that man,
the one with the mustache...

7
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:47,411
...and thank him, see?

8
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,552
For giving you a chance
to let him see you.

9
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,187
And tell him who you are
and what you've done. Go on.

10
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,323
Hurry up now, go on.

11
00:02:58,127 --> 00:02:59,992
I'm Lillian Roth. I'm 8 years old.

12
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,222
I do imitations and dramatic parts.

13
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:05,367
I was in <i>The Inner Man</i> with Wilton Lackaye
for nine weeks.

14
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,163
I played Theda Bara as a child
for Paramount.

15
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:10,568
My mama told me to thank you.

16
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,173
Lillian, darling.

17
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:16,676
The director's a very busy man.
I can't imagine what possessed the child.

18
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:20,475
It's just that she wants so much
to be an actress, you know.

19
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,880
Come along, darling.

20
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:30,314
Stage mothers. They're all alike.

21
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:35,693
- What did you stop for?
- When, Mama?

22
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:38,766
When he said, "That little girl, come over,"
why didn't you go?

23
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:41,995
I told you a million times,
you can't be shy in this business.

24
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:46,505
- But he wanted the pretty little girl.
- There's no little girl prettier than you.

25
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:54,443
Are you a stage mother?

26
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:58,246
Don't you ever let me hear you
say that again. You understand?

27
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:00,651
My baby.

28
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,848
I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean it.

29
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:05,856
I love you, Lillie, baby.

30
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,623
Oh, look at your pretty dress.

31
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:11,790
I didn't mean it. Did I hurt you?

32
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:16,064
No. It's all right, it didn't hurt.

33
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:21,639
Next time, you'll get the job.

34
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,913
There'll be Broadway plays
and Hollywood.

35
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:28,073
You'll be happy, successful, the best.

36
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:31,778
They'll ask for you.
You won't have to push anymore.

37
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,981
Now it's different, darling.
They gotta know who you are, see?

38
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:37,490
And we gotta show them.

39
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:41,385
And you have to believe
that I know what's right.

40
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,324
And I love you.

41
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:48,068
I love you no matter what. All right?

42
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:51,665
Don't cry anymore.

43
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:54,036
It's nothing to cry about, honey.

44
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,269
Mama loves you.

45
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,174
Don't cry. Don't cry anymore.

46
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,955
Don't cry, baby. Enough already.

47
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,663
I'll tell you what,
you could cry tomorrow, huh?

48
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,932
Sure. You wait until tomorrow.

49
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:23,670
You got all day tomorrow to cry, huh?

50
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:35,607
Hey! Hey, Lums!

51
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,448
Hi, Lums. Today's my birthday.

52
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:39,849
Congratulations.

53
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:41,354
Come on in. The water's fine.

54
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,617
- I can't.
- Don't you ever do what you want to?

55
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:47,957
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

56
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:51,066
<i>Happy birthday, dear David</i>

57
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:54,101
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

58
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,354
You won't leave till I tell her?

59
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,422
- Lillie?
- Of course not.

60
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,252
- I'm sorry. It was all my fault.
- I've got wonderful news.

61
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,054
No, Mrs. Roth. It was all my fault.

62
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,287
Never mind that now.
Lillie, it's happened.

63
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,127
The Keith circuit. We go to Chicago
day after tomorrow, darling.

64
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,792
Come on, get off these wet things.
Get into a hot tub.

65
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,995
- Bye, Lums.
- Bye, David.

66
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:31,401
Happy birthday.

67
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:34,668
After Chicago, we play the Midwest,
and who knows what will happen?

68
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:36,812
Darling, didn't I tell you
this would come?

69
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,675
Everything will turn out right.
They liked your audition.

70
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,545
See? Who knows,
maybe you'll be a big star, huh?

71
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:47,018
Oh, it's going to be wonderful.
Everything we ever dreamed of.

72
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,658
<i>Go on, bow. Bow.</i>

73
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:47,404
<i>Brothers and sisters</i>

74
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:50,876
<i>Now hear and obey</i>

75
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:55,450
<i>You can lose the blues</i>
<i>Whenever you choose</i>

76
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,782
<i>By singin' your troubles away</i>

77
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,718
<i>Brothers and sisters</i>

78
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,557
<i>Startin' today</i>

79
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:13,566
<i>Get yourself a song</i>
<i>And you'll get along</i>

80
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:19,402
<i>You'll chase all your worries away</i>

81
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,503
<i>You sinners, drop everything</i>

82
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,114
<i>Let that harmony ring</i>

83
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,683
<i>Up to heaven and sing</i>

84
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:32,320
<i>Sing, you sinners</i>

85
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,854
<i>Just wave your arms all about</i>

86
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,549
<i>Raise your voices and shout</i>

87
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,991
<i>Pour that music right out</i>

88
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,824
<i>Sing, you sinners</i>

89
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,626
<i>Whenever there's music</i>

90
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:49,100
<i>The devil kicks</i>

91
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,399
<i>He don't allow music</i>

92
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,041
<i>By that river Styx</i>

93
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,734
<i>You're wicked and you're depraved</i>

94
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:58,345
<i>And you've all misbehaved</i>

95
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,381
<i>If you wanna be saved</i>

96
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,984
<i>Sing, you sinners</i>

97
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,711
- <i>Just wave your arms all about</i>
- <i>Sing</i>

98
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,375
- <i>Raise your voices and shout</i>
- <i>Sing</i>

99
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,783
<i>Pour that music right out</i>

100
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:42,116
<i>Sing, you sinners</i>

101
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,690
<i>You sinners, sing</i>

102
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:46,692
<i>Whenever there's music</i>

103
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,831
<i>The devil kicks</i>

104
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,524
<i>OI' Mr. Satan kicks</i>

105
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:58,603
<i>He don't allow music</i>

106
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:01,368
<i>By that river Styx</i>

107
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:06,846
<i>You're wicked and you're depraved</i>

108
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:11,282
<i>And you've all misbehaved</i>

109
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:16,448
<i>If you want to be saved</i>

110
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:24,731
<i>Sing, you sinners</i>

111
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,564
<i>Sing, you sinners, sing</i>

112
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,098
Thank you. Print it.

113
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:39,512
Thanks, Mummy.
How was it that time?

114
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,741
- It was better.
- I didn't think so.

115
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,715
You've got to relax, darling.
The director told you to relax.

116
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:48,220
I wish that director hadn't said, "Print it."
Maybe we can get a retake.

117
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,121
It looks like we have a great number.
Congratulations.

118
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,659
- You were very good, Lillian.
- Thank you, Mr. Byrd.

119
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,457
But Mama and I think
that maybe I could do it better if...

120
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,999
That's right. Don't be satisfied,
even when it's great.

121
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,433
She was wonderful, wasn't she?

122
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:05,096
Come along, Lillian. We have an hour.

123
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:06,605
And you have to lie down.

124
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:10,007
We'll see you later, Mr. Byrd.
Thank you so much.

125
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:14,138
But it wasn't any good.
I didn't feel anything.

126
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,943
Lillian, Mr. Byrd is your producer.

127
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,985
If he was satisfied,
that should be enough.

128
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,613
- You yourself said it wasn't any good.
- I didn't say anything of the kind...

129
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:25,920
Yes, you did. I said I wished
the director hadn't said, "Print it..."

130
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,723
Lillian, I'm talking to you.
Now, listen to me.

131
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:32,359
It's getting harder to talk to you
all the time.

132
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:36,903
You're not a child anymore, you're a star.
You have to learn to behave like one.

133
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:38,733
- All right, Mama.
- All right.

134
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:42,435
Here, you have four appointments
this afternoon. Don't forget.

135
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:44,511
Now, you lie down and rest now,
all right?

136
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,147
All right.

137
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,040
We're on our way, darling.

138
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:52,654
It's gonna be just wonderful.
Wait and see.

139
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:00,027
Mr. David Tredman called again.

140
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:04,257
David? David Tredman,
here in Hollywood?

141
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,166
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, he called again?

142
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:10,601
Why, I left several messages from him
with your mother.

143
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,973
- Where is he?
- The Palms Hospital.

144
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:16,611
- Well, thanks a lot.
- You're quite welcome, ma'am.

145
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,381
Hiya, Lums.

146
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:27,416
There's only one man in the whole world
who'd call me that.

147
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,249
David.

148
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:37,562
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
It's been so long.

149
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,566
You know,
I didn't even know you'd called.

150
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,567
What's wrong?
Why are you in a hospital?

151
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,730
They took pictures of my head
and found out I didn't have brains.

152
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,103
Which is something
we've known for years.

153
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:50,973
No, it isn't anything serious.

154
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,811
I thought you were too busy
to come and see me.

155
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:59,284
Mama and I have been up to our necks.
I'm starting a big picture.

156
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,980
Sure. I'll bet you didn't even
get the messages I left.

157
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:06,719
You look wonderful.
You look just wonderful.

158
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:09,990
Tell me about it, the whole trip
to the moon. Do you enjoy it?

159
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:14,399
You know something?
You haven't changed a bit.

160
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,332
- Are you married?
- No.

161
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:18,734
You got a girl?

162
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,899
I'm not sure.

163
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:25,844
How's your mother? Oh, no,
you ask me the questions, sorry.

164
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,210
Mama's fine.

165
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:30,477
Are you out here to stay?

166
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,620
Well, that depends.

167
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,121
Do you think if I rang this twice,
they'll know I mean service for two?

168
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:42,026
Well, David, I can only stay a few minutes.
I've got four appointments.

169
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:44,688
You haven't changed either.
I have to treat you right.

170
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,529
I've seen you in newspapers
dining with Gary Cooper.

171
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:50,900
I don't even know Gary Cooper.
Those are just publicity pictures.

172
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:53,064
That's settled, then.
You'll stay for lunch.

173
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,076
I'm sure you're a very good lawyer.

174
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,213
You better tell that to my senior partner.

175
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,009
He's afraid I'm gonna suddenly prosecute
a shady client instead of defend him.

176
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,084
Is that why he banished you
to California?

177
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:05,481
No, I volunteered.

178
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,817
I'm out here to build up
our show-business clientele.

179
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,757
And besides, I have a friend out here
who doesn't get East often enough.

180
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,494
You know, I've really gotta go.
I'm keeping people waiting.

181
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,725
But not for 10 years. Look, why...

182
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,994
David...

183
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,167
All you need now is a fire hydrant.

184
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,641
Yes. And remember, you were the one
who was gonna protect me from Mama.

185
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,803
Except I was afraid of your mother.

186
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,312
That'll be the day.

187
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:36,349
I haven't forgotten a thing.
Do you know what I was gonna say?

188
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,782
You going anyplace now
or the day after tomorrow?

189
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,581
No, I'm not going anywhere.

190
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,054
That's wonderful.
I'm gonna be out after tomorrow.

191
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:46,717
- My goodness, what's going on here?
- Nothing, it was just a little accident.

192
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:48,192
- I'll call you.
- When?

193
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,592
Well, tomorrow.

194
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:53,257
Call me tonight before 9:00.
She locks me up at 9:00.

195
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,733
It's a pretty good idea too.

196
00:15:55,904 --> 00:16:00,000
- All right, tomorrow.
- It was wonderful to see you, Lums.

197
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:01,403
Bye, David.

198
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,078
The month's gone by so fast.

199
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:07,306
We're gonna write, and the picture
will be finished in a few weeks.

200
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:11,385
David, how soon before
you'll really be back?

201
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,748
I haven't even faced the fact
I'm leaving yet.

202
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,625
David, when am I gonna see you again?

203
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,257
We'll work it out.

204
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,421
- How?
- We'll find a way.

205
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:25,756
Will we see each other again?

206
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:28,198
- Oh, we will.
- When?

207
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,565
I don't know yet.

208
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,368
I'm only gonna be gone for a little while.

209
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,170
Hold me, David.

210
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,205
Hold me.

211
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,452
Don't go, David.

212
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,787
Please don't go.

213
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:58,331
I'll get you back to New York, I promise.

214
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,614
Come in.

215
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,284
- Hi, Katie.
- Oh, hello, David.

216
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,622
- Getting settled?
- Well, it'll take a little while.

217
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,286
One day California,
the next day New York.

218
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,456
I hope I didn't take you away
from anything.

219
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,123
Oh, it'll wait.

220
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:37,569
You said what we had to talk about
couldn't be discussed by phone.

221
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,336
Well, I couldn't very well give you
a great big hug over the phone, could I?

222
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:45,813
That's for closing Lillian's deal
at the Palace.

223
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,381
The Palace and then a big national tour.

224
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,915
How did you do it, David?

225
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,576
Lillie's agent is a client of our firm's.
I got lucky.

226
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,518
But Lums was ready. She did it.

227
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,590
We all did it.

228
00:17:57,392 --> 00:18:01,692
I've been organizing the act
and going over numbers.

229
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:05,163
You know,
two weeks is such a short time.

230
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,833
I guess you know how I feel.

231
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,939
It's like having $999,000.

232
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:16,976
And then, one little extra shove,
and suddenly, you're a millionaire.

233
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,904
Something I've been working
for all my life.

234
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:21,549
I know.

235
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,982
You know, it's funny
remembering somebody as a child.

236
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:31,126
You forget, people grow up, huh?

237
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,124
You're a man now.

238
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:37,391
A young one, but a man.
And a very smart one.

239
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:38,999
- Well...
- Oh, now, David...

240
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,932
...a man who did
what you just did is no fool.

241
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:43,366
Not completely, no.

242
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,507
You understand things, David.

243
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:49,271
That's not the end of something, huh?
It's just the beginning.

244
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:52,109
Well, that depends on what you want.

245
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:54,044
What we want.

246
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,683
Who's we?

247
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:57,318
We?

248
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:00,212
Lillian and I.

249
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,483
That's what we've always wanted
and worked for.

250
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:04,887
And it hasn't been easy.

251
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,426
Believe me, David,
you don't know the half of it.

252
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,461
The troubles.

253
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:14,799
The disappointments we've had,
the sacrifices we've had to make...

254
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,734
...just so Lillian could sing
and go on singing...

255
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,636
...and the whole world would hear her.

256
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:22,871
Do you understand what I mean?

257
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,639
I think so. That's what you want.

258
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,975
Me? Me, Lillian, what's the difference?

259
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:31,449
The same flesh and blood.

260
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,588
You and I want Lillian to be happy.

261
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,121
And she wants us to be happy.

262
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,384
But we're three different people.

263
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,593
Each of us has the right
to decide where we belong.

264
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:43,597
Or whether we belong at all.

265
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:46,057
Without that, there's nothing.

266
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:49,401
You may want one thing,
and she may want another.

267
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:51,963
And I may want a third.

268
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,098
What do you want, David?

269
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,835
Me, personally?

270
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,646
I wanna like myself. That's first.

271
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,306
And then I wanna like others.

272
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:07,111
I wanna call them by their first name
because I know them and they know me.

273
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:12,488
And I wanna sing and whistle
and make mistakes.

274
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:15,159
I wanna have a home
with three or four children...

275
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,561
...and a wife who can bawl me out
for not being ambitious enough...

276
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:21,032
...because I won't be.
- Yeah.

277
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,832
So you live in one world
and I live in another, huh, David?

278
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,373
And what has that go to do
with Lillian personally?

279
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:29,275
Personally? Lums?

280
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:30,672
Well, what about me?

281
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:33,906
- Hello, darling.
- Hi, Mama.

282
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,545
You sound like a couple
of high-class philosophers.

283
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,019
What about me personally?

284
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:44,555
You wanna tell her, Katie?

285
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:48,685
What? We were talking about the Palace,
the tour, what David did.

286
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:53,426
You know, I was going over numbers
and picking gowns.

287
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:56,162
We were having a heart-to-heart talk.

288
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,828
That's right.

289
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,798
Well, what about me personally, Mama?

290
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,438
You walk into the middle
of a conversation.

291
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:09,311
It's not about you personally, darling.
We were talking in general.

292
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,452
- I was...
- May I tell her?

293
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,554
We were talking specifically about you.

294
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,849
And us, but mostly you.

295
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:20,017
Now, after the Palace and the tour,
what do you want?

296
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:28,130
Whatever David wants,
that's what I want.

297
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,071
You see, whatever makes David happy
makes me happy.

298
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:38,509
You see, Mama, I wanna be David's wife.

299
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,210
So where is it written that
you can't be a wife and have children...

300
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,118
...and also be big star, huh?

301
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,520
All right.

302
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:56,688
Talk is cheap.

303
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:59,766
Philosophy isn't life.

304
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,998
Lillian, darling, you've worked,
you know, since when?

305
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,799
Since a baby.

306
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:09,273
All this time,
we've struggled just for this.

307
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,809
Believe me, it's not a question
of what I want. It's what is. It's facts.

308
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:18,919
You start here, you get there,
you don't turn back.

309
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:22,718
And there's the fact: You're a star.

310
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,753
I wanna be a wife to David.

311
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:29,862
I wanna be a real wife to him,
not one who's away on tour all the time...

312
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:32,865
...whose kids are growing up
in dressing rooms.

313
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:35,529
I'm sorry, Mama.

314
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:40,368
I don't want them to be like I was,
growing up backstage, sitting on trunks.

315
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:44,171
When my husband comes home,
I wanna be there.

316
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:47,611
And if I feel like singing...

317
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,343
I mean, want to sing, Mama.

318
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,317
- well, then, I can do it
for my husband and my friends...

319
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:55,854
...or maybe even an audience.

320
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:58,424
But only when I want to.

321
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:01,655
I just wanna settle down with David.

322
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:07,094
Well, I have to be going now.

323
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:21,473
David?

324
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,610
- What do you think?
- It's...

325
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:29,018
You know something?
I don't like it either.

326
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,989
- The next one I really like.
- The one you should've shown me.

327
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,492
I would have,
except it wasn't quite ready yet.

328
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,599
Oh, David, remember when you see this,
it doesn't have all the...

329
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:43,962
David? Darling, what's the matter?

330
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,607
Would someone help me, please?

331
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,366
David, what is it?

332
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:53,904
Oh, I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble
at a time like this.

333
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,209
But don't be silly, darling.

334
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:10,462
- Miss Roth, phone call.
- Oh, thank you.

335
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,758
Hello?

336
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:17,230
Hello, Lillian, darling?

337
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:26,306
I just wanted to call you and thank you
for your present before you went on.

338
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:27,846
Yes.

339
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:32,753
Oh, it's a lot of fun.

340
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:36,686
Thanks, darling.

341
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,194
I love you, darling.

342
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:45,532
And I love you.

343
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,764
Darling, do you feel all right?
You sure now?

344
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:52,868
Listen to me.

345
00:24:55,143 --> 00:24:57,509
Don't go out and kill them, dear.

346
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,073
Go out and live.

347
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:03,912
I will, darling.

348
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:06,950
All right, Mama.

349
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:10,216
I have to go now. I'll see you soon.

350
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:12,292
Bye, sweetheart.

351
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:33,414
<i>When the red, red robin</i>

352
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:36,346

00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:48,195

00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:51,996

<i>When the red, red robin</i>
<i>Comes bobbity bobbin' along</i>

381
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:19,217
- Where's my mother?
- Telephone.

382
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:39,970
What's the matter, Mama?

383
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:42,636
Nothing, I...

384
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:45,712
- There was a phone call.
- Is it...?

385
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:50,974
- Lillie...
- The hospital?

386
00:27:51,152 --> 00:27:52,380
Now, baby.

387
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:54,613
- We're holding it for you, Miss Roth.
- David?

388
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:56,757
- He's gone, sweetheart.
- David!

389
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,189
- Lillie!
- Miss Roth, your next number.

390
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:02,228
They're waiting, Miss Roth. Miss Roth!

391
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:04,092
Quick, you're up. Come on.

392
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:06,221
Now, Lillie, darling,
you shouldn't have that around, dear.

393
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:07,918
- It only reminds you...
- I want it.

394
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:10,087
I want it right here.

395
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:13,098
Miss Roth, you might rest better
in a sanitarium.

396
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:15,099
No, she wouldn't.

397
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:23,143
I know my little girl.
She could never stand a sanitarium.

398
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:27,975
Don't worry, darling. We will cancel
the vaudeville tour, all right?

399
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:31,812
- What did you say?
- We'll cancel the tour.

400
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:35,752
Oh, Mama, we can't.
We can't cancel that tour.

401
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:39,325
Now, baby, you're in no condition
to start singing. You can't do it.

402
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:41,928
Oh, but I wanna sing.

403
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:44,087
I can sing.

404
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:47,066
I've gotta sing, Mama.

405
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,164
Doctor...

406
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:52,372
You see, David arranged that tour.

407
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,202
And he was going with me.

408
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,537
It may be a good idea,
but take Ellen with you.

409
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,940
Of course.

410
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,559
Good morning.

411
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:24,666
Look at what some ardent admirer
left at your doorstep.

412
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,602
Let's see.

413
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:30,034
- Oh, aren't they beautiful, Lillian?
- Aren't they beautiful?

414
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:31,940
Look.

415
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:36,379
I never thought,
when I went to nurses' school...

416
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:39,349
...l'd end up hanging around newsstands
waiting for reviews.

417
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:40,783
They're wonderful, Lillian.

418
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:43,549
They are? Well, let's see.
Let's read them.

419
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,488
Oh, Lillian, listen to this:

420
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,719
"Lillian Roth wins ovation.

421
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:51,332
Lillian Roth, who has been captivating
audiences throughout the country...

422
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:54,991
...had a standing-room audience last night
cheering and applauding."

423
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,333
May I help you?

424
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:01,475
Theatrical cold cream, please.

425
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:07,879
You're Lillian Roth, aren't you?

426
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:11,682
I saw you last night at the Rajah's Theater,
and you were great.

427
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:13,445
Thank you.

428
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,051
This is my pal Henry.

429
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,592
We're gonna go and see you
again tonight. See you.

430
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:23,496
That's great.

431
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:28,292
I'm Wallie.

432
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,198
Well, anyhow, we don't know
very many people around here.

433
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:36,741
Look, if we could go back to camp
and tell the fellows that...

434
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:38,902
Well, maybe after the show tonight...

435
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,775
Excuse me.

436
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:43,948
Certainly. We'll be very glad
to see you backstage.

437
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:45,881
Why don't you come back
after the show?

438
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:48,215
- We'd like to.
- Maybe we could all have dinner.

439
00:31:49,357 --> 00:31:53,623
Lillie, darling, the time is getting
close on that date, sweetheart.

440
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:57,228
Go without me.

441
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:03,069
Oh, come on, Lillie,
it'll do you good, huh?

442
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:04,602
We'll have some fun.

443
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:09,937
We'll listen to some music,
and maybe we'll crack a few jokes.

444
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:13,239
I don't wanna listen to music,
and I don't wanna crack a few jokes.

445
00:32:13,414 --> 00:32:14,745
Come on, now, Lillie,
darling.

446
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:20,252
I don't wanna listen to music,
and I don't wanna crack a few jokes!

447
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:28,056
Hello?

448
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:31,357
- Apologize the best you can.
- I'll handle it.

449
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:37,596
Lillie.

450
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,069
Lillie.

451
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:44,734
What you're doing to yourself
is very wrong.

452
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:46,470
I know.

453
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:50,911
You always knew when I was
doing things that were wrong.

454
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:53,019
Even my first audition.

455
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:56,588
Remember my first audition,
all the things I did that were wrong?

456
00:32:56,758 --> 00:33:00,125
Well, what I'm doing now is wrong,
and I'm doing it.

457
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:03,354
What I mean is, it's wrong for you,
for your own good, sweetheart.

458
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:05,522
That's another thing you're an expert on.

459
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,498
You're a real pro on that subject.

460
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,763
You always know what's good for me.

461
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:15,905
How to dance,
where to sing, what to wear...

462
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:18,412
...who to go out with.

463
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:23,950
So, what I'm doing now,
it's not for my own good, and I'm doing it.

464
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:30,720
David is dead, darling.
You've got to learn to forget.

465
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:33,585
Forget?

466
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:37,262
You wish there was nothing
to remember.

467
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,957
You hated him. You think I don't know?

468
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:43,399
All those phone calls
you never even told me about?

469
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:46,563
"Lillie, darling,
you can't go out with David tonight."

470
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:49,574
"Lillie, dear,
I wish you'd stop seeing that boy."

471
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,843
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
he's not dead.

472
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:55,880
I'll always remember. I'll never forget.

473
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,610
And I don't care
whether it's good for me or bad for me.

474
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,777
Or whether it's right
or whether it's wrong.

475
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,924
Or whether you like it or you don't like it.

476
00:34:04,092 --> 00:34:09,257
And just this once,
I want you to leave me alone.

477
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:25,339
Lillie, you're my daughter. I...

478
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:32,112
All I ever wanted was for us...
Was for you to be happy, darling.

479
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:36,221
Happier than I was.

480
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:42,222
That's what I want now, so...

481
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:45,658
So maybe it's better...

482
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:51,234
It's better
if I'm not here for a while, huh?

483
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:58,000
So I'll leave you alone, huh?

484
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:13,284
Ellen, you'll take good care of my...?

485
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:35,445
That's in case you wanna hit me.

486
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:39,512
Because I'm telling you, Lillie, my girl,
you've got to forget.

487
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:42,213
I've got to forget?

488
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:46,620
His smile, his love?

489
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:49,058
His understanding?

490
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:57,700
Don't you understand, Ellen?

491
00:35:57,872 --> 00:36:00,033
I am forgetting.

492
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,066
That's what's killing me.

493
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:16,618
Sometimes three days go by...

494
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,356
...and I don't remember his face,
his name...

495
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:23,986
...that I said,
"I love you and I always will."

496
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,461
What kind of a person am I?

497
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:30,467
What's the matter with me?

498
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:33,106
Can't I feel anything?
Is everything about me fake?

499
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,368
My heart and my talent, everything?

500
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:41,806
Mama's tried to help and so have you.

501
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:44,543
Now I've chased her out of here.

502
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:48,722
I'm nasty and vicious.

503
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,586
I say things I don't mean.

504
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:58,288
I'm so mixed-up, so confused.

505
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:03,799
Sometimes at night...

506
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:08,132
...I wake up
and I don't believe it's true at all.

507
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:10,574
He never died.

508
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:14,579
It was just a dream,
and now the dream's ended and he's here.

509
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:16,911
But he isn't.

510
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:22,889
And it hurts.

511
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,589
It hurts so hard.

512
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:32,563
And then, maybe because
I can't stand the pain...

513
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:35,964
...or I'm just no good, I forget.

514
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,967
Like I never said, "I'll marry you."

515
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:45,977
Like the one good thing
that ever happened in my life...

516
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,773
...never did.

517
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:55,718
And then when I try to touch it...

518
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,256
...when I reach out and try to hold it...

519
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:00,018
...just the memory of it...

520
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,652
...I reach out into the darkness
and there's nothing.

521
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:08,127
And that nothing isn't David.

522
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:12,337
It's me, Lillian Roth.

523
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,029
Drink it.

524
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:46,372
Go on, drink it.

525
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:49,836
What for?

526
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:53,139
Because then maybe you'll get
a good night's sleep.

527
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:57,011
This isn't in the rulebook,
but I can't think of anything else.

528
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,920
One gulp or you'll never get it down.

529
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:29,005
<i>Ellen was right.</i>

530
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,141
<i>The tension was easing up.</i>

531
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,483
<i>After the second drink, I drifted off</i>
<i>into the first real sleep I'd had...</i>

532
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:38,056
<i>... since David died.</i>

533
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:44,588
<i>Every night after that,</i>
<i>I drank myself to sleep.</i>

534
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:49,929
<i>I felt I no longer needed</i>
<i>Katie's reassurance.</i>

535
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:51,799
<i>I was getting it out of a bottle.</i>

536
00:39:52,673 --> 00:39:57,076
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>I was completely secure on a stage.</i>

537
00:39:57,244 --> 00:40:00,304
<i>I was sure at last that they liked me.</i>

538
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,712
<i>And I deserved it. I was something.</i>

539
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:09,015
<i>I was glamorous.</i>
<i>I was the best singer in the world.</i>

540
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,021
Hey!

541
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:15,189
Hi, remember me?

542
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:17,091
Why, sure. You're Wallie.

543
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:19,528
From San Antone,
on a two-day pass, remember?

544
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,295
- I'm sorry about that last time.
- Not me, it means you still owe me a date.

545
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,699
- Hi.
- Hi.

546
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:26,863
Hello there. How about it?

547
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,441
- Well, I don't see why not.
- Wonderful.

548
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,010
You know what I'm gonna do?
Teach you how to conga.

549
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,441
- How to what?
- Conga.

550
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:36,811
Why, it's a dance we do down in
San Antone. You don't know how...?

551
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:42,847
Not me. I'm going back to the hotel.

552
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,719
No chaperon?
Well, what are we waiting for?

553
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:49,329
All I've got is a weekend pass,
so let's go, huh?

554
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:07,778
Stand up. You all right?

555
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:09,575
A ship.

556
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:14,477
- Lillie, ahoy!
- Hey, wait for me.

557
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:16,623
Wait for me.

558
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,056
Stuck.

559
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,092
- What's the matter?
- I'm stuck.

560
00:41:22,263 --> 00:41:25,164
- You're not.
- Hey, you, get off the boat.

561
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:29,268
- Hoist the anchor.
- Come on.

562
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:32,867
Captain.

563
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:35,570
Hey, captain.

564
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,210
Bombs away!

565
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:40,400
What are we doing here?

566
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,044
Hi.

567
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:05,455
What's the matter?

568
00:43:07,034 --> 00:43:10,470
Lillie. Lillie...

569
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:20,041
I'll get you a drink.

570
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:25,249
No. No, I don't want that.

571
00:43:26,954 --> 00:43:31,118
- What day is this?
- Sunday.

572
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,552
It's good it isn't Monday.

573
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:38,095
I have a matinee on Monday.

574
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:41,197
I better get to a phone and call Ed.

575
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,768
Now, wait a minute. No phones.

576
00:43:43,937 --> 00:43:46,462
My father hears about
us being married...

577
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,667
...he'll burn up. The lumber yard
will be reduced to ashes.

578
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:53,446
Well, you can just cool off.

579
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:56,777
Because no matter what you said,
we're not gonna get married.

580
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,577
We did.

581
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:04,084
We did what?

582
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:07,016
Marry.

583
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:24,101
And I asked Mama to leave me alone.

584
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:27,204
Just once.

585
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:33,110
<i>Now, I was really on my own.</i>

586
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:35,915
<i>I was doing exactly what I wanted to do.</i>

587
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,184
- <i>So we tried all the best places.</i>
- Thank you.

588
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,557
<i>Conga, rumba, Cuba libre.</i>

589
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,392
<i>We tried to forget</i>
<i>that we didn't love one another.</i>

590
00:44:45,566 --> 00:44:49,662
<i>I even tried to believe</i>
<i>that Mama was pleased at my marrying.</i>

591
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:54,406
<i>In fact, we tried just about everything</i>
<i>but staying sober.</i>

592
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:57,169
<i>Drinking became our way of life.</i>

593
00:44:57,344 --> 00:45:00,802
<i>It was a means</i>
<i>of forgetting our problems.</i>

594
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:05,580
<i>And sometimes we actually got around</i>
<i>to eating dinner.</i>

595
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:08,517
<i>First, some celery and olives.</i>

596
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:12,250
<i>Then steak for two.</i>

597
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:23,736
<i>Everything was beautiful.</i>
<i>Everything was hazy.</i>

598
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,513
<i>Except for the fact that my exits...</i>

599
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:43,349
<i>... were becoming much less glamorous</i>
<i>than my entrances.</i>

600
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,622
<i>And what we spent kept increasing.</i>

601
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:50,992
<i>What I made grew smaller.</i>

602
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:56,327
<i>We tried to forget that our marriage</i>
<i>was anything but one large mistake.</i>

603
00:45:56,503 --> 00:46:01,099
<i>But what I didn't realize at all</i>
<i>was how much of the time I was drunk.</i>

604
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:16,283
You certainly were disgusting.

605
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:19,783
- What?
- What?

606
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:26,032
- Look at your hair.
- Look at my hair?

607
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:31,999
One whole year
we've been getting dressed like this.

608
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:34,572
- Every night, we go out...
- Unhook me.

609
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:37,369
- and we look at people,
people look at us.

610
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:40,775
One whole year we've been doing this.

611
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:43,049
Oh, I'm tired.

612
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,412
Looking at people,
having people look at me.

613
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:49,784
- I'm tired of being Mr. Lillian Roth.
- Why didn't you go back to Pittsburgh?

614
00:46:50,424 --> 00:46:51,721
What?

615
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:55,417
What's wrong with Pittsburgh?

616
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:59,626
- How should I know?
- What'd you say that for, then?

617
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,426
- What'd I say?
- Look here, you just said that...

618
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:06,630
Pittsburgh was...
My dad's in the lumber business...

619
00:47:06,807 --> 00:47:08,741
So what?

620
00:47:10,844 --> 00:47:13,278
Well, look,
everybody can't be a movie star.

621
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:18,316
The lumber business
is a good, honest business.

622
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:21,613
And there's pine
and there's oak and there's...

623
00:47:21,788 --> 00:47:23,551
Look, do you know what this is, huh?

624
00:47:23,724 --> 00:47:26,591
Do you know what this is? Plywood.

625
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,287
Plywood is this stuff.
The whole door is plywood.

626
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:38,300
You don't even care, do you?

627
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:41,807
You don't even like
the lumber business, do you?

628
00:47:41,975 --> 00:47:43,875
Well, I like it.

629
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:47,207
And I been doing a lot of thinking.
There's a lot of things that...

630
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:49,975
Look, I'm a man. I'm a man.

631
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:53,244
- And I've gotta get to work.
- What are you gonna be a man at?

632
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,944
Well, I could've been a pilot.

633
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,682
Yeah, I could've been.
Only, you didn't let it.

634
00:47:57,858 --> 00:48:01,191
Just because I don't want the plane
to fall down and get killed?

635
00:48:01,762 --> 00:48:03,525
Didn't I buy you a plane?

636
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:05,164
- What?
- What did you do to it?

637
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:08,233
What? Nothing. We've still got...

638
00:48:08,936 --> 00:48:12,770
- You're all mixed up.
- I am not mixed up.

639
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,602
You just don't like anything about me.

640
00:48:15,776 --> 00:48:18,745
You don't like my hair,
you don't like my friends.

641
00:48:18,912 --> 00:48:20,846
- You hate me!
- I don't hate you.

642
00:48:21,014 --> 00:48:22,982
- I didn't say that.
- Then what did you say?

643
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,516
I said that I didn't...

644
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:31,622
I don't know. I don't know.

645
00:48:34,428 --> 00:48:36,157
I just don't know.

646
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:44,003
- She don't even know what plywood is.
- Oh, plywood, plywood, plywood.

647
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,835
If you love lumber so much,
why don't you marry Pittsburgh?

648
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:57,509
Maybe I will.

649
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,318
Maybe I just will.

650
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:07,185
Maybe I will.

651
00:49:10,797 --> 00:49:14,198
I'll have my lawyer
call you in the morning.

652
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:38,387
Lillian, it's so good to see you.
I haven't seen you for such a long time.

653
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,822
- It's good to see you too.
- Where's your husband?

654
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:42,222
- I haven't seen him.
- Who?

655
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,990
- Your husband, isn't he here?
- I shouldn't think so.

656
00:49:45,165 --> 00:49:48,430
You see, we broke up two years ago.

657
00:49:51,505 --> 00:49:54,303
I'll help you out here.
Play the piano, hon.

658
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:55,805
Hey, Joe.

659
00:49:55,976 --> 00:49:58,672
Hey, Lillie, baby,
you got a great party going.

660
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:01,643
For you, it's almost gone.
Slow it down to a shout, will you?

661
00:50:01,815 --> 00:50:05,649
- All right, down to a shout.
- That's a good boy.

662
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,516
- All right.
- Wanna start something?

663
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:14,786
- That's all right.
- Did I get it all over you?

664
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:16,189
That's all right.

665
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:19,161
Take Miss Roth's advice.
Slow it down like a good fella, huh?

666
00:50:19,332 --> 00:50:23,098
- It's all right, Joe.
- Okay, baby.

667
00:50:25,572 --> 00:50:28,507
- I'm terribly sorry.
- I'm Tony Bardeman.

668
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:32,338
The uninvited guest.
I came with Bob and Pauline.

669
00:50:33,146 --> 00:50:35,273
- May I stay?
- Did he hurt you?

670
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,644
Oh, no, no. I never felt better.

671
00:50:39,853 --> 00:50:42,083
Your friend sure needs practice.

672
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:44,422
- Your accompanist?
- Just one of the many.

673
00:50:44,591 --> 00:50:46,286
He starts drinking before breakfast.

674
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,587
That'll ruin his constitution
and your piano.

675
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:51,322
It's there to be ruined.
My real one's in the next room.

676
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:54,831
Oh, good, let's see it. Excuse us.

677
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:08,272
Well, go on. Sing it.

678
00:51:11,284 --> 00:51:12,615
Wait a minute. This is silly.

679
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:15,721
- lf I start, they'll all come in.
- Well, we could shut the door.

680
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:17,686
Oh, but we won't.

681
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:20,824
Your answer to everything is no.

682
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:23,461
I'll be your orchestra.

683
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:27,530
- No?
- No.

684
00:51:27,701 --> 00:51:29,532
Have you heard this before?

685
00:51:34,775 --> 00:51:36,003
No.

686
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:40,645
Of course not.
I'm making it up right now.

687
00:51:41,114 --> 00:51:44,140
No, I'm not really.
It's just a little item Mozart created.

688
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,846
You know something?
I think you're crazy.

689
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:55,156
Maybe you're right.
It's more fun that way.

690
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:02,798
- Paul?
- Yes, ma'am.

691
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:04,527
- Drink?
- Oh, no. No, thanks.

692
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,103
- You're sure?
- Very sure.

693
00:52:06,273 --> 00:52:08,400
- All right, Paul, thanks.
- Thank you.

694
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:13,235
You sure you don't want
another drink?

695
00:52:13,413 --> 00:52:14,744
No.

696
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:18,815
You may not know it, but I'm quite high.

697
00:52:18,985 --> 00:52:20,213
- Yeah.
- Really?

698
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,378
- Yeah.
- You can't tell it.

699
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:24,982
I'm a little high myself.

700
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:28,321
I thought your eyes
were that bright naturally.

701
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:31,555
You know, I admire someone
who knows he's high...

702
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,825
...and has the strength to say,
"I don't want another drink."

703
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:37,436
Survival.

704
00:52:38,505 --> 00:52:42,271
There's a little policeman who lives
on a high tower in the back of my head.

705
00:52:42,442 --> 00:52:44,103
Blows a whistle.

706
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:46,274
And a red traffic light goes on...

707
00:52:46,446 --> 00:52:48,710
...and it says,
"Beware that one extra drink."

708
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:53,046
And I stop.
All credit goes to my little policeman.

709
00:52:53,954 --> 00:52:55,251
Nuts to you!

710
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,947
I'll break up anything in this house
if I feel like it.

711
00:52:58,124 --> 00:52:59,352
Wanna start something?

712
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:02,757
- Come on. I'll take you.
- Get him out of here.

713
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,193
Everybody, get in.

714
00:53:05,365 --> 00:53:07,333
Joe, don't do that. Please, stop it, Joe.

715
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,866
- It's all right. Take it easy now.
- Come on, Joe.

716
00:53:10,036 --> 00:53:12,470
- Let's go, Joe.
- Oh, Lillie.

717
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:15,130
- Mr. Bardeman, be careful of him.
- You know me.

718
00:53:15,308 --> 00:53:16,832
- Tell them, tell them.
- All right.

719
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:20,446
- Let's go.
- Be careful, please.

720
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:31,615
Pardon me, ladies.

721
00:53:37,564 --> 00:53:40,328
Oh, pardon me, sir.

722
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:19,299
- Say...
- Yes, sir?

723
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:24,374
He put up a bad fight,
and I may have hurt him.

724
00:54:24,544 --> 00:54:26,808
Why don't you get him downstairs
into a taxi, huh?

725
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,572
Of course, sir.

726
00:54:31,451 --> 00:54:33,248
George...

727
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:36,622
- What happened? Where'd everybody go?
- Oh, hi.

728
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:40,487
Well, looks like Joe
really busted up the party.

729
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,992
- How is he?
- Oh, he's fine.

730
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:44,562
Good.

731
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:47,360
I can't stand a man
who can't hold his liquor.

732
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,298
You know, drinking like that
is a curse, a sickness.

733
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:56,366
Thank you for helping me tonight.

734
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,977
Go on, make me feel important. I like it.

735
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:02,805
- You live in New York?
- California.

736
00:55:03,683 --> 00:55:06,914
I like California.
I made a lot of money there.

737
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:10,420
I like California too,
but I haven't made a dime so far.

738
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:13,789
I'm going back, day after tomorrow.

739
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,564
Would it be very unladylike
of me to say...

740
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:24,136
...that I wish you weren't going back
the day after tomorrow?

741
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,502
To a man, that's the most ladylike thing
any lady can say.

742
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:33,410
Well, do you have to leave?
I mean, the day after tomorrow.

743
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,377
Is it very important?

744
00:55:35,548 --> 00:55:38,608
Nothing I do is very important.
But I enjoy it.

745
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:42,645
Well...

746
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:48,427
Would it be very unladylike of me
to ask what you were doing tomorrow?

747
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,460
I mean, all day.

748
00:55:51,398 --> 00:55:54,333
I'll be busy packing, getting ready.

749
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,503
Like what tomorrow, lunch?

750
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,803
Yes, lunch. Let's say from 12 to 5.

751
00:56:05,211 --> 00:56:08,408
I'll try to work it out. Anyway, I'll call.

752
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:14,451
You hold lunch open.
And wait for my call, say about 11:00.

753
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,857
- Good night.
- Good night.

754
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:45,411
You sure there's nothing I can do?
- No. I'll call you if I need you.

755
00:56:45,585 --> 00:56:47,143
Thank you.

756
00:57:09,476 --> 00:57:11,535
It's all right, Paul. I'll get it.

757
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,849
Hi, Mama.
What are you doing in this part of town?

758
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,679
Nothing.
I was just in the neighborhood.

759
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,346
Just in the neighborhood?
Half-hour away from home.

760
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:28,858
What? So I came to see you. So?

761
00:57:29,262 --> 00:57:34,495
- Well, what's all this?
- None of your business.

762
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:41,202
It's orange juice.
No gin in it. Here, smell.

763
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:43,901
Now, what did you just happen
to be here about?

764
00:57:44,077 --> 00:57:47,205
- Nothing, I...
- What's with the special visit?

765
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:51,511
- Who is he?
- He?

766
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,021
I don't know how to explain, Mama.
He's wonderful.

767
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:00,921
He's... Well, you'll just have to stay
and meet him, that's all.

768
00:58:01,094 --> 00:58:04,291
- Today would be the wrong time.
- Well, stay a little bit.

769
00:58:04,464 --> 00:58:06,694
You're here now,
and I can give you your check.

770
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:10,700
And then when the bell rings downstairs,
then you can leave, huh?

771
00:58:11,504 --> 00:58:14,564
His name is Tony Bardeman.
He's from the coast.

772
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,902
He reminds me just a little bit of David.

773
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,067
I met him last night.
He came to the party.

774
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:22,772
And there's something about him, Mama,
that I've never seen before in...

775
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:27,646
Lillie, darling. It's 2:30. I'm starving.

776
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,219
Eat.

777
00:58:30,056 --> 00:58:32,320
Wish you'd stop walking around.
You make me dizzy.

778
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:37,054
Listen, this is my house.
If I wanna walk, I'll walk.

779
00:58:37,497 --> 00:58:39,692
Maybe he was delayed.
Why get so excited?

780
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:42,596
Look, I'm not excited.
So don't make me more excited.

781
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,532
Maybe he thought it was tomorrow, huh?

782
00:58:44,704 --> 00:58:47,571
A man you meet once, makes a date
and then doesn't keep it...

783
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,708
...that doesn't mean anything.

784
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:52,572
Lillie. Lillie, do you know
what you're gonna become?

785
00:58:52,745 --> 00:58:55,009
You're going to become
an old-fashioned drunkard.

786
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:57,775
That's just what I came
to talk to you about, Lillie.

787
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,387
You're on your own. I should mind
my own business, but you're my daughter.

788
00:59:01,554 --> 00:59:05,081
Everybody is talking,
the agents, the managers.

789
00:59:05,258 --> 00:59:06,725
- Everybody's talking, huh?
- Yes.

790
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:10,192
Louie is afraid to submit you
to the Shuberts because of your drinking.

791
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:13,298
Everybody's talking?
Why doesn't anybody let me in on it?

792
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,297
Money going out, nothing coming in.

793
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:19,063
Let me tell you something.
I can stop drinking whenever I want to.

794
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:22,902
You see, I've got a little policeman
back here with a traffic light.

795
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:25,840
Relax, Ma.
I'll always be able to support you.

796
00:59:26,012 --> 00:59:28,879
If you can stop drinking any time,
why don't you stop now?

797
00:59:29,048 --> 00:59:31,482
- Why don't you stop today?
- All right, I'll stop now.

798
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,585
I'll stop today.

799
00:59:35,021 --> 00:59:37,888
I'll give you your check,
we'll go out to lunch.

800
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:40,423
I'm so glad, Lillie.
It's just that I was afraid.

801
00:59:40,593 --> 00:59:43,255
- You see, I've been so worried...
- Oh, all right, okay.

802
01:00:05,985 --> 01:00:09,182
It's on the desk. I'll get my coat.

803
01:00:13,793 --> 01:00:17,524
- Paul. Paul!
- Yes, ma'am.

804
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,723
If anybody calls me, you tell them
I left here at five after 12.

805
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,800
- Five after 12, understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

806
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:25,301
Call my car. Come on.

807
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:37,906
All right.

808
01:00:38,484 --> 01:00:40,452
Mama, you go ahead and have lunch.

809
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,884
- Oh, come on.
- I'm not hungry. I'm not gonna eat.

810
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,887
You talk to Louie. All right, go ahead.

811
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,650
I'll see you later.

812
01:01:11,384 --> 01:01:13,750
May I have a glass of water, please?

813
01:01:19,025 --> 01:01:21,289
I'm sorry, I don't feel very well.

814
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:44,575
That'll fix it, huh?

815
01:01:53,426 --> 01:01:55,360
Feel better, honey?

816
01:01:55,962 --> 01:02:00,365
I don't know what hit me.
I felt so awful, so funny.

817
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:03,001
I know. The shakes, huh?

818
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:05,330
They come and they go.

819
01:02:05,671 --> 01:02:08,231
You just needed a little drink, that's all.

820
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:11,935
I know the signs. Boy, do I know them.

821
01:02:12,912 --> 01:02:15,847
You know, you ought to get yourself
a little flask or something.

822
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,614
Then if it gets tough when you're
somewhere you can't get to a drink...

823
01:02:19,786 --> 01:02:23,813
...well, you can always go
into a ladies' room or like that.

824
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,259
Excuse me, honey.

825
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,367
<i>Every nerve in my body was screaming.</i>

826
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:48,537
<i>I couldn't believe</i>
<i>this was happening to me.</i>

827
01:02:48,714 --> 01:02:52,810
<i>All I had to do was open that door and walk</i>
<i>10 steps to the bar in my living room...</i>

828
01:02:52,985 --> 01:02:55,351
<i>... to find relief from this torture.</i>

829
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:58,149
<i>Nothing could have that hold on me.</i>

830
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:02,394
<i>I had to face it, confront it.</i>
<i>It was the only way.</i>

831
01:03:02,562 --> 01:03:05,156
<i>I could, and I had to.</i>

832
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:38,096
<i>I took the drink I didn't want to take.</i>

833
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:44,161
- Good evening, Miss Roth.
- Good evening.

834
01:03:49,609 --> 01:03:53,943
<i>The entire character of my drinking</i>
<i>changed after that.</i>

835
01:03:54,113 --> 01:03:57,048
<i>Almost overnight,</i>
<i>I became a secret drinker.</i>

836
01:03:57,216 --> 01:04:00,276
<i>I lived in constant terror</i>
<i>of being found out...</i>

837
01:04:00,453 --> 01:04:03,718
<i>... of having my name</i>
<i>spread over the newspapers.</i>

838
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:06,757
<i>But like all alcoholics, I lied to myself.</i>

839
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:11,829
<i>I told myself I was drinking</i>
<i>because I was high-strung and sensitive.</i>

840
01:04:11,998 --> 01:04:14,728
<i>I was an artist. I'd been hurt.</i>

841
01:04:14,901 --> 01:04:17,665
<i>One day, it was to pick me up</i>
<i>because I was down.</i>

842
01:04:17,837 --> 01:04:22,103
<i>Another, it was to quiet me down</i>
<i>because I was so high.</i>

843
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:31,248
You'd better put the chair on the stage.

844
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,513
Miss Lillian Roth.

845
01:04:33,686 --> 01:04:38,248
Here we go!

846
01:04:57,209 --> 01:05:02,943
<i>It seems like happiness</i>

847
01:05:03,115 --> 01:05:09,611
<i>Is just a thing called Joe</i>

848
01:05:09,922 --> 01:05:12,584
<i>He's got a smile</i>

849
01:05:12,758 --> 01:05:18,060
<i>That makes the lilac wanna grow</i>

850
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,255
<i>He's got a way</i>

851
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:26,497
<i>That makes the angels heave a sigh</i>

852
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:28,902
<i>When they know</i>

853
01:05:29,075 --> 01:05:34,604
<i>Little Joe's passin' by</i>

854
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,342
<i>Sometimes the cabin's gloomy</i>

855
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:44,649
<i>And the table's bare</i>

856
01:05:45,391 --> 01:05:47,359
<i>Then he'll kiss me</i>

857
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:52,691
<i>And it's Christmas everywhere</i>

858
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,733
<i>Troubles fly away</i>

859
01:05:56,902 --> 01:06:05,810
<i>And life is easy go</i>

860
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:11,579
<i>Does he love me good?</i>

861
01:06:12,118 --> 01:06:18,887
<i>That's all I need to know</i>

862
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:24,587
<i>Seems like happiness</i>

863
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:29,099
<i>Is just a thing</i>

864
01:06:29,268 --> 01:06:34,604
<i>Called Joe</i>

865
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:40,245
<i>Little Joe</i>

866
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,780
<i>Little Joe</i>

867
01:06:44,316 --> 01:06:52,018
<i>Little Joe</i>

868
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,365
I'm all right. Leave me alone.

869
01:07:10,543 --> 01:07:12,135
I'm fine.

870
01:07:16,882 --> 01:07:18,543
Next act.

871
01:07:18,718 --> 01:07:21,778
Oh, it's you and your stupid steps.

872
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:26,254
Jeepers creepers.
Everybody's nuts around here.

873
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:32,317
Come in.

874
01:07:38,435 --> 01:07:42,371
I said, come in. The door's open.

875
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:45,940
Greetings.

876
01:07:49,245 --> 01:07:51,338
Next time, try Western Union.

877
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:56,008
It's less embarrassing,
and you've got nine words left over.

878
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:01,788
Why didn't you call?

879
01:08:05,795 --> 01:08:08,161
Maybe I wanted to find out
if you'd miss me.

880
01:08:08,431 --> 01:08:10,956
All right, you know now.

881
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:12,897
You can leave.

882
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:15,404
You should've called.

883
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:18,630
Why didn't you call?

884
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:22,109
Maybe I wanted to find out
how much I'd miss you.

885
01:08:22,278 --> 01:08:24,371
Look, you should've called.

886
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:27,573
I have no little policeman, no traffic light.

887
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,115
I've been drinking all day...

888
01:08:29,285 --> 01:08:32,311
...every day since the day
before you left for California.

889
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:35,822
- And I'm drunk!
- I know.

890
01:08:36,126 --> 01:08:39,493
I know. Sometimes my cop
falls asleep on me too.

891
01:08:41,097 --> 01:08:44,032
Maybe I wanted to be sure
that he wouldn't ever again.

892
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:50,534
Maybe that's why I didn't call.
Maybe now that I'm sure, I'm here.

893
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:58,312
Are you trying to tell me
that you drink the way I do...

894
01:08:58,481 --> 01:09:00,813
...and you can just stop?
- That's right.

895
01:09:00,984 --> 01:09:04,545
How? Please, you've got tell me how.

896
01:09:04,721 --> 01:09:08,452
You see, I need somebody
who understands this thing.

897
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:11,788
- I should've called. I should've called.
- I've tried to stop this.

898
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:15,294
You know, I went away to a place
where they have a saltwater cure.

899
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:18,832
And I came back so sick,
I could hardly stand up.

900
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:24,270
I've even read pamphlets
from Alcoholics Anonymous.

901
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:30,777
I'm desperate. I don't know
why I'm telling you all these things.

902
01:09:31,681 --> 01:09:34,172
Because you said you need somebody
who understands.

903
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,045
And I do.

904
01:09:37,387 --> 01:09:41,585
Maybe that's why I really didn't call.

905
01:09:42,592 --> 01:09:45,789
I never could admit
that I needed anything or anybody.

906
01:09:47,163 --> 01:09:48,858
But I do.

907
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:53,632
I need you, and you need me.

908
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,962
Lillie, darling.

909
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,336
Let's go on the wagon together, huh?

910
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,637
On a wagon like that,
we could travel anywhere.

911
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,010
Lillie, what do you say?

912
01:10:05,748 --> 01:10:09,275
Oh, Tony. Oh, Tony.

913
01:10:10,653 --> 01:10:13,383
I'm so glad to see you.

914
01:10:14,324 --> 01:10:18,158
You know, that day you left?

915
01:10:18,328 --> 01:10:21,855
I didn't take one single drink,
not one single drink until 4:00.

916
01:10:22,031 --> 01:10:24,465
I'm gonna take you away,
and we'll help each other.

917
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:27,159
When? When can we leave? Tonight?

918
01:10:27,337 --> 01:10:31,603
No, I can't. I have to go to Chicago.
I'll only be gone a couple of weeks.

919
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:34,402
A couple of weeks?
Well, why can't I go with you?

920
01:10:34,577 --> 01:10:35,805
It's business, darling.

921
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:39,771
I have to raise $5000.
I'll be tied up every minute.

922
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:43,651
- Five thousand dollars? I can give it to you.
- No.

923
01:10:44,988 --> 01:10:48,685
You could lend it to me. But I'd want you
to know what the whole set up is.

924
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:51,918
- Is $5000 enough?
- Yeah, for now.

925
01:10:52,562 --> 01:10:54,587
You could make yourself a lot of money.

926
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:56,931
When can we leave? Tonight?

927
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:00,467
No, I've gotta go to Chicago first
to close the deal.

928
01:11:00,637 --> 01:11:05,267
Then you can meet me there,
and we'll leave for the coast together, huh?

929
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,102
In about a week.

930
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:36,697
I could kill myself for making that deal
fall through in Chicago.

931
01:11:36,873 --> 01:11:39,000
Forget it, honey.

932
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:42,441
Maybe there'll be a better deal
in California.

933
01:11:42,612 --> 01:11:44,204
Sure, honey.

934
01:11:44,981 --> 01:11:47,711
Now, stop torturing yourself, and relax.

935
01:11:48,217 --> 01:11:49,479
I can't relax...

936
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:52,348
...because I know
how much that deal meant to you.

937
01:11:52,522 --> 01:11:54,581
Why can't I ever do things that are right?

938
01:11:54,757 --> 01:11:57,749
You're gonna make yourself very sick
if you keep on that way.

939
01:12:01,164 --> 01:12:02,688
Come here.

940
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,532
We still have a whole lifetime
in which we can help one another.

941
01:12:10,807 --> 01:12:12,399
Come in.

942
01:12:15,812 --> 01:12:17,541
Miss Roth.

943
01:12:17,714 --> 01:12:19,614
Mrs. Bardeman.

944
01:12:20,283 --> 01:12:21,648
Pardon me.

945
01:12:21,818 --> 01:12:23,979
Yes, sir, I read about that.

946
01:12:24,153 --> 01:12:26,144
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

947
01:12:26,322 --> 01:12:27,721
Yes, sir.

948
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,624
Tony, I don't want a drink.

949
01:12:33,162 --> 01:12:34,823
It's for me, honey.

950
01:12:34,997 --> 01:12:38,364
Well, you mustn't.
We promised, remember?

951
01:12:38,534 --> 01:12:39,899
Promised?

952
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:43,730
It was needing a drink
that made you break up my conference.

953
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:46,170
But I only phoned
because I didn't want a drink.

954
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:47,741
I needed you.

955
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,003
Then you should've waited
until I got there.

956
01:12:50,179 --> 01:12:51,578
It only took me half an hour.

957
01:12:51,748 --> 01:12:54,182
Well, I'd been waiting hours
before I called.

958
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:59,049
And when I need a drink that bad,
half-hour's like a half a century.

959
01:12:59,222 --> 01:13:03,090
Yeah. Yeah, it was my fault
you got dead drunk.

960
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:05,454
I should've spent all my time
looking after you.

961
01:13:05,628 --> 01:13:10,258
Tony, I didn't say it was your fault.
Please, get rid of that bottle.

962
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:13,201
You don't have to drink it, honey.
It's for me.

963
01:13:13,603 --> 01:13:16,572
Here's to us and that other deal.

964
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:19,572
But, Tony, I know I'm the one
who went off the wagon first.

965
01:13:19,742 --> 01:13:21,437
And I now you're disappointed in me.

966
01:13:21,611 --> 01:13:24,580
But it's never gonna happen again.
Please, Tony.

967
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:32,113
- Stop it.
- Tony...

968
01:13:32,655 --> 01:13:36,989
That's very expensive stuff.
If you don't believe it, smell it.

969
01:13:48,104 --> 01:13:51,835
Now, let's change the whole subject, huh?
Relax.

970
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:56,408
We still got 39 hours
before we get to California.

971
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:10,449
Here's to our Mutual Aid Society.

972
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:14,688
You're the president,
and I'm the treasurer.

973
01:14:19,836 --> 01:14:23,602
You know the part I really like,
is where we needed each other.

974
01:14:23,773 --> 01:14:28,369
You needed me, and I needed you.
Oh, brother, did I need you.

975
01:14:30,046 --> 01:14:31,911
Honey, I'm afraid you'll get very drunk.

976
01:14:32,915 --> 01:14:36,009
And what are you,
or aren't you afraid of that?

977
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:38,720
Me?

978
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:42,183
I'll just get more charming.

979
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,792
- No.
- Where are you going?

980
01:14:46,963 --> 01:14:48,863
I wanna get out.

981
01:14:49,065 --> 01:14:52,660
- You're still Lillian Roth, all right.
- Look, let me out of here.

982
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:56,262
You don't need a husband,
you need a keeper.

983
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:59,499
You never cared. You never cared at all.

984
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:02,906
Let me out of here.
I can't stand to look at you.

985
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:06,181
- I'm not through talking yet, honey.
- I don't wanna play games.

986
01:15:06,349 --> 01:15:08,374
I don't wanna play games either.

987
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:13,051
Stop, Tony!

988
01:15:18,661 --> 01:15:20,526
I'm drunk.

989
01:15:20,863 --> 01:15:24,321
I'm what you call
a real A number one drunk.

990
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:27,164
He's all right. He's fine.

991
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:30,232
He's fine. He's a real doll.

992
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:34,433
My maid left this morning
because I'm such a drunk.

993
01:15:35,545 --> 01:15:38,673
Everybody feels sorry for him.

994
01:15:38,848 --> 01:15:41,578
Must respect...

995
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:48,381
There's drunks, and there's drunks.

996
01:15:48,558 --> 01:15:51,823
Me? I'm what you'd call
an adorable drunk.

997
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:53,291
See?

998
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:57,463
He's mean.

999
01:15:57,633 --> 01:15:59,225
Maybe you can tell me, mister.

1000
01:15:59,402 --> 01:16:02,496
Why is it when some men get drunk,
they get mean?

1001
01:16:02,672 --> 01:16:04,435
- Real mean.
- Just take it easy.

1002
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:08,475
And then the next day, they're sorry.

1003
01:16:08,644 --> 01:16:10,202
So sorry.

1004
01:16:11,013 --> 01:16:13,538
Yeah, he's great. He's my husband.

1005
01:16:13,716 --> 01:16:17,846
He's a doll,
and I've got the scars to prove it.

1006
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:22,616
Oh, well, that's okay with me.

1007
01:16:22,792 --> 01:16:26,057
I'm no good. I'm no good.

1008
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:28,093
It's the way it's gotta be.

1009
01:16:28,264 --> 01:16:31,893
I'm just nothing, a hopeless drunk.

1010
01:16:32,268 --> 01:16:34,759
Getting just what I deserve.

1011
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:38,262
Oh, well. That's life.

1012
01:17:25,154 --> 01:17:27,088
Please, please help me.

1013
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:30,987
My husband is going to kill me.
Get me away from him, fast.

1014
01:17:34,263 --> 01:17:36,993
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

1015
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:39,566
- No, no, no.
- What are you...?

1016
01:17:39,735 --> 01:17:42,465
Take it easy. She's very drunk.
She's out of her head.

1017
01:17:42,638 --> 01:17:44,629
- Don't listen.
- Came from a mental hospital.

1018
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:46,434
- He's lying. Don't listen.
- Come on.

1019
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:49,271
- Call the police.
- lf you take her, you're in trouble.

1020
01:17:49,445 --> 01:17:53,381
- No, no, no.
- Come on, Lillie. Let's go, let's go.

1021
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:06,794
Hello.

1022
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:09,358
Yes, I'll take it.

1023
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,103
Hello?

1024
01:18:16,372 --> 01:18:19,034
Katie, my love. How are you?

1025
01:18:19,809 --> 01:18:22,073
Just like a couple of lovebirds.

1026
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:23,609
Yeah.

1027
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,810
No, Katie, Lillie isn't here.
She's out shopping.

1028
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:29,714
Oh, but it isn't
the middle of the night, honey.

1029
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:33,048
It's 11:00 where you are,
but it's only 8:00 here.

1030
01:18:35,491 --> 01:18:37,891
She's more beautiful than ever.

1031
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,286
Yeah. She hasn't?

1032
01:18:41,897 --> 01:18:45,025
Well, I guess it's because
she's been so busy.

1033
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:46,595
Yeah.

1034
01:18:47,069 --> 01:18:49,537
No, not singing. Being my wife.

1035
01:18:50,673 --> 01:18:53,471
Oh, she'll be sorry she missed your call.

1036
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:57,442
Yeah, she misses you too, and so do I.

1037
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:01,343
All right, Katie. Have fun.

1038
01:19:01,517 --> 01:19:02,882
Take it easy.

1039
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:05,247
Yeah, so long.

1040
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:21,861
End of the line, lady. End of the line.

1041
01:20:23,299 --> 01:20:26,166
Hey, lady. End of the line.

1042
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:43,778
See you later, John.

1043
01:20:54,096 --> 01:20:55,961
She's been riding the car
for five hours.

1044
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:58,224
Back and forth, back and forth.

1045
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,731
Drunk.

1046
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:41,672
All right, sister, wake up.

1047
01:21:41,844 --> 01:21:44,244
Come on, wake up. It's closing time.

1048
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:49,581
It's time to go home.

1049
01:22:23,585 --> 01:22:26,213
- I knew a babe in Mexico...
- Save it.

1050
01:22:26,388 --> 01:22:28,356
That's the girl, honey. Sing us a song.

1051
01:22:28,524 --> 01:22:30,685
She's barreled.

1052
01:22:31,961 --> 01:22:34,225
I tell you, I know this dame.

1053
01:22:36,432 --> 01:22:38,297
She's a famous singer.

1054
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:40,935
She used to be a beauty.

1055
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:48,067
Here, take mine, honey.

1056
01:22:48,243 --> 01:22:50,336
What's your name, honey?

1057
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:58,442
My name is Lillian Roth,
and I'm 8 years old...

1058
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,952
...and I do imitations
and dramatic parts...

1059
01:23:01,123 --> 01:23:04,286
...and I was in <i>The Inner Man</i>
with Mr. Wilton Lackaye...

1060
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,428
...and I played...

1061
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:11,519
Make them stop looking at me.

1062
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:18,757
I'm so ashamed.

1063
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:21,487
Just drink a little water.
You'll be all right.

1064
01:25:24,066 --> 01:25:29,163
Katie, come and get me.

1065
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:31,863
- Yes, she will.
- Take me home.

1066
01:25:33,442 --> 01:25:36,809
All right. Everything's all right.

1067
01:25:40,182 --> 01:25:42,650
My mother...

1068
01:26:26,128 --> 01:26:29,928
- Coffee's almost ready, darling.
- I don't want any.

1069
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,725
Smells ready. I think I'll have a cup, huh?

1070
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:35,335
Mom...

1071
01:26:36,572 --> 01:26:37,937
Mom, you promised.

1072
01:26:38,106 --> 01:26:42,975
All right, darling.
Let's have a cup of coffee first, huh?

1073
01:26:43,145 --> 01:26:45,340
You promised, Mom.

1074
01:26:48,884 --> 01:26:51,114
You still have a little in the bottle?

1075
01:26:51,286 --> 01:26:54,050
There's not even enough there
for one drink.

1076
01:26:54,289 --> 01:26:58,282
Well, all right, then I'll get a fresh bottle
when I go down for something for supper.

1077
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:01,429
Mom, Mom, I want it now.
I've got know that it's there.

1078
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:04,157
I've got to know
that there's enough there for later.

1079
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:06,528
Mom, I've gotta have it.
I've got to, Mom.

1080
01:27:06,702 --> 01:27:08,067
Yes, darling.

1081
01:27:08,237 --> 01:27:09,966
No, no "yes, darling."

1082
01:27:10,138 --> 01:27:12,197
Just go out and get me the bottle, huh?

1083
01:27:14,309 --> 01:27:17,574
What would you like to have for supper?

1084
01:27:17,746 --> 01:27:21,807
I don't care. I don't care.
Just stop fiddling and get the bottle.

1085
01:27:23,252 --> 01:27:26,346
Look what you did.
And you did it on purpose!

1086
01:27:26,521 --> 01:27:29,581
You're still trying to make me do
what you want, be what you want.

1087
01:27:29,758 --> 01:27:33,524
I can't be anything except what I am!
Look, what did you drop that bottle for?

1088
01:27:33,695 --> 01:27:35,663
What are you trying to do,
drive me crazy?

1089
01:27:35,831 --> 01:27:39,289
Go on, get the bottle! Get it now!

1090
01:27:39,468 --> 01:27:41,265
All right.

1091
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:43,565
All right.

1092
01:27:53,548 --> 01:27:55,812
All right, it's my fault, huh?

1093
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:03,424
I made you become an actress,
you didn't want to, all right.

1094
01:28:03,592 --> 01:28:04,820
I've been a bad mother.

1095
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:06,961
You had to support me, all right.

1096
01:28:07,129 --> 01:28:10,530
All right, all right, everything.

1097
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:12,494
Just this.

1098
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:15,637
And for once in your life,
you're gonna hear it.

1099
01:28:15,971 --> 01:28:18,769
Do you know at all why I did it?
Do you? No, you don't.

1100
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,635
Do you know what kind of life I had?

1101
01:28:20,809 --> 01:28:22,936
Know what it was like
to live with your father?

1102
01:28:23,111 --> 01:28:26,444
Put up with his mistakes, and afterwards,
to be left alone with nothing.

1103
01:28:26,615 --> 01:28:29,778
No money, no career, not young anymore,
nothing to fall back on.

1104
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:31,213
No, you don't.

1105
01:28:31,386 --> 01:28:33,786
You don't know at all
what I tried to save you from.

1106
01:28:33,955 --> 01:28:36,048
The kind of freedom I never had...

1107
01:28:36,224 --> 01:28:38,715
...I tried to give to you
by making you Lillian Roth.

1108
01:28:38,894 --> 01:28:41,727
So you admit it.
You invented Lillian Roth.

1109
01:28:41,897 --> 01:28:43,364
All right, now, look at me.

1110
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:46,160
I said, look at me!
Don't turn your face away.

1111
01:28:46,335 --> 01:28:48,929
I'm the looking glass you created
to see yourself in.

1112
01:28:49,104 --> 01:28:51,436
All right, see yourself now, in me.

1113
01:28:51,606 --> 01:28:53,267
Look at this ugly picture.

1114
01:28:53,442 --> 01:28:54,909
And then get out of here!

1115
01:28:55,077 --> 01:28:59,275
But keep this picture before your face
as long as you live!

1116
01:29:03,819 --> 01:29:05,514
It's true.

1117
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:10,521
Oh, God, help me.

1118
01:29:12,394 --> 01:29:14,658
I owe you this.

1119
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:18,366
Every single word of it is true.

1120
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,495
No, Mama.

1121
01:29:22,104 --> 01:29:24,595
No, Mama. No.

1122
01:29:25,006 --> 01:29:26,234
No, Mama.

1123
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:28,239
No, Mama, Mama.

1124
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:31,038
It's not true. Mama.

1125
01:29:31,213 --> 01:29:33,773
You know how I get
when I need a drink.

1126
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:37,680
I go out of my mind, Mama.

1127
01:29:37,853 --> 01:29:39,718
Mama, don't cry.

1128
01:29:39,888 --> 01:29:42,721
It kills me when you cry.

1129
01:29:43,692 --> 01:29:46,627
Oh, it kills me
that you had to see me like this.

1130
01:29:46,795 --> 01:29:48,888
That you have to live with me like this.

1131
01:29:49,064 --> 01:29:51,862
Mama, Mama.

1132
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:54,393
Mama.

1133
01:29:55,237 --> 01:29:58,570
Remember what you used to tell me?

1134
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:05,202
You said, "Cry tomorrow.
You've got all day tomorrow."

1135
01:30:05,981 --> 01:30:07,676
Mama.

1136
01:30:08,617 --> 01:30:10,380
Cry tomorrow.

1137
01:30:13,822 --> 01:30:15,756
Oh, babe.

1138
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:18,592
Mama...

1139
01:30:19,227 --> 01:30:21,058
...I tell you what.

1140
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:27,065
You go and wash your face,
and comb your hair pretty.

1141
01:30:27,402 --> 01:30:29,996
And I'll get your supper, huh?

1142
01:30:30,172 --> 01:30:31,935
All right, Mama?

1143
01:30:32,507 --> 01:30:34,441
Who could eat what you cook?

1144
01:30:34,609 --> 01:30:36,201
What do you mean? I'm good.

1145
01:30:36,378 --> 01:30:38,846
I'm great at slicing salami.

1146
01:30:39,014 --> 01:30:40,447
Mama, don't cry.

1147
01:30:40,615 --> 01:30:42,242
I'll go down to the delicatessen...

1148
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:45,716
...and I'll get some salami
and garlic and pickles...

1149
01:30:45,887 --> 01:30:47,787
...and maybe some rye bread
and weenies.

1150
01:30:47,956 --> 01:30:49,753
Just like in the old days.

1151
01:30:49,925 --> 01:30:51,654
And then we'll have a picnic, huh?

1152
01:30:51,827 --> 01:30:53,818
Look, you make some fresh coffee.

1153
01:30:53,995 --> 01:30:56,088
It's gonna be all right, Mama.

1154
01:30:58,767 --> 01:31:01,099
There's money here in my pocketbook.

1155
01:31:03,338 --> 01:31:04,771
You'll need a coat, huh?

1156
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:07,807
Oh, no, no. I don't need a coat.

1157
01:31:07,976 --> 01:31:12,345
It's just downstairs, Mama.
We'll have a party.

1158
01:33:41,963 --> 01:33:43,794
Oh, dear God.

1159
01:33:43,965 --> 01:33:48,129
Help me. Help me.

1160
01:36:24,192 --> 01:36:26,524
Hello, I'm Jerry.

1161
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:28,590
I'm Selma.

1162
01:36:30,365 --> 01:36:31,730
I...

1163
01:36:33,134 --> 01:36:35,432
I've gotta talk someone.

1164
01:36:35,603 --> 01:36:37,036
Sure.

1165
01:36:37,238 --> 01:36:38,603
Have a chair.

1166
01:36:38,773 --> 01:36:40,570
That's what we're here for.

1167
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:51,247
Tell us about it.

1168
01:36:53,988 --> 01:36:58,687
You see, she started drinking
when she was 18...

1169
01:36:59,027 --> 01:37:01,495
...and she never really stopped.

1170
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,000
I can't stay.
My mother's waiting for me.

1171
01:37:08,169 --> 01:37:09,864
Oh, stay and talk.

1172
01:37:11,172 --> 01:37:12,469
This is Burt.

1173
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:14,675
Hello.

1174
01:37:18,746 --> 01:37:20,976
Her mother's waiting for her.

1175
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,745
Well, why not try to begin?

1176
01:37:25,887 --> 01:37:28,082
My story isn't funny.

1177
01:37:29,424 --> 01:37:31,358
I can't live.

1178
01:37:32,227 --> 01:37:34,354
And I can't die.

1179
01:37:36,497 --> 01:37:39,933
If you wanted to die, you never
would've walked through that door.

1180
01:37:41,736 --> 01:37:43,863
What's your mother's phone number?

1181
01:37:50,211 --> 01:37:54,648
Riverside 6-9971.

1182
01:37:54,816 --> 01:38:01,051
- I'll call.
- Ask for Mrs. Roth.

1183
01:38:09,831 --> 01:38:11,662
Now we can talk, huh?

1184
01:38:14,102 --> 01:38:19,438
You started drinking when you were 18,
and you haven't stopped.

1185
01:38:19,607 --> 01:38:21,973
The first drink I can remember...

1186
01:38:24,178 --> 01:38:25,406
I can't.

1187
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:27,047
I can't talk.

1188
01:38:27,215 --> 01:38:31,549
- Nobody'd understand.
- We'll take you home. That's all right.

1189
01:38:32,387 --> 01:38:34,821
We've all been through this ourselves.
We understand.

1190
01:38:34,989 --> 01:38:37,219
It isn't so hard to understand.

1191
01:38:46,601 --> 01:38:48,068
When it...

1192
01:38:48,436 --> 01:38:52,668
...looked to everyone like I didn't care...

1193
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:57,334
...that I was shameless,
and I didn't care what I did...

1194
01:38:58,146 --> 01:39:00,011
...I cared the most.

1195
01:39:00,181 --> 01:39:06,051
When I was the most disgusting,
I was trying the hardest.

1196
01:39:07,155 --> 01:39:09,214
I just couldn't make it.

1197
01:39:10,058 --> 01:39:11,821
I tried.

1198
01:39:13,461 --> 01:39:16,988
Why doesn't anybody believe
that I tried?

1199
01:39:17,732 --> 01:39:20,701
With all my heart, I tried!

1200
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:24,104
I need a drink.

1201
01:39:24,272 --> 01:39:26,433
I don't want a drink.

1202
01:39:26,607 --> 01:39:29,405
But I need a drink. I need a drink!

1203
01:39:29,577 --> 01:39:31,169
Now!

1204
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:41,849
Just a minute.

1205
01:39:42,156 --> 01:39:44,886
- Easy, Mrs. Roth.
- Please. I'm sorry.

1206
01:39:45,059 --> 01:39:48,051
It's really better not to see her now.

1207
01:39:48,229 --> 01:39:49,992
I'll tell her that you came.

1208
01:39:50,164 --> 01:39:52,689
We'll let you know the moment
you can see her.

1209
01:39:53,301 --> 01:39:54,893
It's all right, Mrs. Roth.

1210
01:39:55,069 --> 01:39:59,005
She's in very good hands.
We've been all through this ourselves.

1211
01:40:01,209 --> 01:40:02,642
Then you understand...

1212
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:08,908
...because I don't, really.

1213
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:10,983
I never have.

1214
01:40:17,058 --> 01:40:19,720
- You'll let me know?
- Absolutely.

1215
01:40:19,894 --> 01:40:22,294
I'll take you home, Mrs. Roth.

1216
01:40:24,432 --> 01:40:25,797
Thank you.

1217
01:40:25,967 --> 01:40:27,559
Thank you.

1218
01:40:36,644 --> 01:40:38,839
Kill them! Go out and kill them!

1219
01:40:39,013 --> 01:40:40,776
Kill them! Kill them!

1220
01:40:40,948 --> 01:40:43,382
Kill them! Kill them!

1221
01:40:43,551 --> 01:40:45,178
Kill them!

1222
01:40:46,721 --> 01:40:49,622
No, David. No, David.

1223
01:40:50,691 --> 01:40:52,158
Go out...

1224
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,555
Go out and live.

1225
01:40:55,029 --> 01:40:56,792
Go out and live.

1226
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:25,025
I've been giving you all
a pretty bad time.

1227
01:41:26,461 --> 01:41:29,294
No worse than
we've all given each other.

1228
01:41:30,398 --> 01:41:32,832
That drying out is the worst.

1229
01:41:38,573 --> 01:41:41,406
That was good advice,
wherever you got it.

1230
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:44,869
- "Go out and live."
- David.

1231
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,814
A man worth remembering.

1232
01:42:14,809 --> 01:42:17,778
I tried to kill myself in this room.

1233
01:42:19,447 --> 01:42:21,278
Right at that window.

1234
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:23,981
And I couldn't do it.

1235
01:42:24,919 --> 01:42:26,853
It wasn't fear.

1236
01:42:27,822 --> 01:42:33,419
And it's strange
because I've been frightened all my life.

1237
01:42:34,662 --> 01:42:36,960
But it wasn't fear.

1238
01:42:37,131 --> 01:42:39,122
Your will to live.

1239
01:42:40,368 --> 01:42:42,928
Then why did I come to this?

1240
01:42:43,771 --> 01:42:45,136
Why?

1241
01:42:45,306 --> 01:42:47,740
Our quarrel with fate...

1242
01:42:47,909 --> 01:42:50,673
...Selma's, mine, all of us...

1243
01:42:51,078 --> 01:42:52,841
...it leads to self-pity.

1244
01:42:53,014 --> 01:42:57,508
Then self-hate. Finally, self-destruction.

1245
01:42:58,252 --> 01:42:59,480
I don't understand.

1246
01:42:59,654 --> 01:43:01,849
What do you mean,
"quarrel with fate"?

1247
01:43:02,023 --> 01:43:03,456
Sure.

1248
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:06,525
All alcoholics have one.

1249
01:43:07,028 --> 01:43:09,223
Hey, when I was a kid in college...

1250
01:43:09,397 --> 01:43:10,796
...I loved sports.

1251
01:43:10,965 --> 01:43:12,489
I liked to go around, you know...

1252
01:43:12,667 --> 01:43:17,434
...dancing, long hikes, football.

1253
01:43:18,606 --> 01:43:21,131
Then this polio paid me a visit.

1254
01:43:21,309 --> 01:43:24,642
After that, I hated everyone and everything,
stayed very much to myself.

1255
01:43:26,614 --> 01:43:31,950
Eventually, my loneliness
would overcome my pride.

1256
01:43:32,119 --> 01:43:35,555
I'd ask some girl to walk with me...

1257
01:43:35,723 --> 01:43:37,554
...but before the end of the evening...

1258
01:43:37,725 --> 01:43:41,126
...l'd be sure that whoever went out
with me, did so out of pity.

1259
01:43:42,230 --> 01:43:44,198
So I started to drink.

1260
01:43:44,465 --> 01:43:46,831
Day in, year out.

1261
01:43:47,768 --> 01:43:49,736
Finally, you hit the bottom.

1262
01:43:49,904 --> 01:43:56,002
You die, or you fight and live.

1263
01:43:57,945 --> 01:44:00,038
I did both in a way.

1264
01:44:00,615 --> 01:44:03,948
I was lucky enough then
to meet these friends...

1265
01:44:04,118 --> 01:44:06,814
...who'd been all through it themselves.

1266
01:44:07,421 --> 01:44:08,888
They...

1267
01:44:09,857 --> 01:44:12,018
We have a kind of prayer at AA:

1268
01:44:14,228 --> 01:44:19,461
"May God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I can't change...

1269
01:44:20,401 --> 01:44:23,393
...the courage
to change the things I can...

1270
01:44:24,839 --> 01:44:26,807
...and the wisdom
to know the difference."

1271
01:44:30,278 --> 01:44:33,475
They helped me
to understand the difference.

1272
01:44:33,648 --> 01:44:39,211
And I hope that we can help you
the same way.

1273
01:44:43,391 --> 01:44:46,986
I should think
there'd be lots of girls...

1274
01:44:47,161 --> 01:44:50,324
...who didn't think that dancing
was that important.

1275
01:44:54,035 --> 01:44:57,004
Oh, I was just using that as an example.

1276
01:45:05,446 --> 01:45:07,778
Good evening. Good evening.

1277
01:45:08,382 --> 01:45:11,249
- I'm Burt McGuire.
- Hi, Burt.

1278
01:45:11,419 --> 01:45:13,614
And I'm an alcoholic.

1279
01:45:15,089 --> 01:45:16,716
Well, tonight's an open meeting.

1280
01:45:16,891 --> 01:45:18,586
Everybody's welcome.

1281
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:23,692
However, I'd like to say
that if there are reporters present...

1282
01:45:24,065 --> 01:45:27,159
...well, write anything you wish,
but please don't use any names.

1283
01:45:27,868 --> 01:45:30,098
All our members are anonymous.

1284
01:45:30,504 --> 01:45:33,667
We try to place principles
above personalities.

1285
01:45:34,709 --> 01:45:39,043
Also, some of our members
are kind of funny.

1286
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:42,108
They didn't used to mind
being seen in the best places...

1287
01:45:42,283 --> 01:45:44,080
...so drunk they couldn't stand up.

1288
01:45:44,251 --> 01:45:48,620
But they're still a little bit sensitive
about being seen here cold sober.

1289
01:45:50,157 --> 01:45:54,025
I'd like to ask those of you
who are here for the first or second time...

1290
01:45:54,462 --> 01:45:56,327
...raise your hands.

1291
01:46:05,606 --> 01:46:07,198
I welcome you newcomers,
and say...

1292
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:11,744
...that the rest of us know
exactly how you feel.

1293
01:46:12,813 --> 01:46:15,646
Each of us once walked through
that door for the first time.

1294
01:46:18,419 --> 01:46:23,686
Now, those of you who are alcoholics,
please raise you hands.

1295
01:46:28,562 --> 01:46:30,189
Thank you.

1296
01:46:31,699 --> 01:46:36,864
The floor is open tonight to those of you
who have been here for six months or less.

1297
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:38,766
We don't want any old goats tonight.

1298
01:46:40,207 --> 01:46:44,234
If you've got anything to say,
just step right up. Come on.

1299
01:46:48,849 --> 01:46:51,010
- I'm Richard Elstead.
- Hi, Richard.

1300
01:46:52,253 --> 01:46:54,221
I'm an alcoholic.

1301
01:46:54,488 --> 01:46:56,752
I joined AA up in New England.

1302
01:46:56,924 --> 01:46:59,859
I went back home after I dried out.

1303
01:47:00,394 --> 01:47:03,625
All the time I was drinking,
I never thought I was on skid row.

1304
01:47:04,432 --> 01:47:06,957
Skid row was a place called the Bowery.

1305
01:47:07,134 --> 01:47:09,625
And the Bowery's in New York,
everybody knows that.

1306
01:47:09,804 --> 01:47:11,772
I couldn't be there.

1307
01:47:12,606 --> 01:47:16,042
I was on skid row, all right,
for 10 long years, and didn't know it.

1308
01:47:17,778 --> 01:47:20,246
I didn't know where I was
when I was drinking.

1309
01:47:31,792 --> 01:47:34,488
- I'm Marge Belney.
- Hi, Marge.

1310
01:47:36,230 --> 01:47:37,925
And I'm...

1311
01:47:41,068 --> 01:47:43,093
I still can't say it.

1312
01:47:54,448 --> 01:47:56,814
I'm an alcoholic.

1313
01:48:00,654 --> 01:48:03,817
I started drinking at the age of 14.

1314
01:48:03,991 --> 01:48:07,290
By the time I was 18,
everyone was saying I was a drunk.

1315
01:48:09,263 --> 01:48:11,731
What I'm finding out...

1316
01:48:12,566 --> 01:48:16,434
...is that without alcohol,
the world is a beautiful place.

1317
01:48:21,175 --> 01:48:24,508
And I'm seeing it for the first time.

1318
01:48:27,348 --> 01:48:30,749
And I wanna thank everyone
for helping me.

1319
01:48:39,159 --> 01:48:41,286
Thank you, thank you.

1320
01:48:41,996 --> 01:48:45,056
Well, that's about what it adds up to.

1321
01:48:46,267 --> 01:48:48,292
We have three choices:

1322
01:48:48,702 --> 01:48:50,499
AA...

1323
01:48:50,905 --> 01:48:52,429
...the psycho ward...

1324
01:48:52,606 --> 01:48:53,937
...or the graveyard.

1325
01:48:55,709 --> 01:48:59,805
And when we get close enough
to the graveyard to recognize it...

1326
01:49:00,981 --> 01:49:03,950
...the issue becomes clear-cut
and simple.

1327
01:49:05,953 --> 01:49:07,784
Die now...

1328
01:49:09,423 --> 01:49:11,857
...or fight and live.

1329
01:49:17,097 --> 01:49:18,428
That's all for now.

1330
01:49:18,599 --> 01:49:22,091
We're serving refreshments.
They're not the kind you're used to...

1331
01:49:22,369 --> 01:49:24,929
...but you'll enjoy them, we hope,
just the same.

1332
01:49:25,105 --> 01:49:27,164
Thank you, thank you.

1333
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:39,014
I've been meaning to ask you something.

1334
01:49:40,287 --> 01:49:41,914
Since you're my sponsor...

1335
01:49:42,089 --> 01:49:44,922
...what does that make you
to the people whose sponsor I am?

1336
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:49,160
You don't need a sponsor anymore.

1337
01:49:51,098 --> 01:49:53,032
That's not true.

1338
01:49:55,069 --> 01:49:56,969
I love music.

1339
01:49:57,471 --> 01:49:59,666
Get a lot of pleasure
out of just listening.

1340
01:50:01,041 --> 01:50:03,669
Close your eyes and you listen.

1341
01:50:06,013 --> 01:50:09,210
When you close your eyes,
all kinds of things are possible.

1342
01:50:10,384 --> 01:50:13,751
- Burt...
- I have your record of this, you know that?

1343
01:50:15,889 --> 01:50:18,380
And I'll bet I've played it
a hundred times.

1344
01:50:19,994 --> 01:50:22,861
What kind of things
are possible when you close your eyes?

1345
01:50:24,231 --> 01:50:30,761
<i>Live, love, laugh and be happy</i>

1346
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:36,466
<i>What if I've been blue</i>

1347
01:50:36,644 --> 01:50:42,378
<i>Now I'm walking through</i>
<i>Fields of flowers</i>

1348
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:47,016
<i>Rain may glisten</i>
<i>But still I listen</i>

1349
01:50:47,187 --> 01:50:49,985
<i>For hours and hours</i>

1350
01:50:50,157 --> 01:50:53,820
<i>I'm just a kid again</i>
<i>Doin' what I did again</i>

1351
01:50:53,994 --> 01:50:55,791
<i>Singin' a song</i>

1352
01:50:55,963 --> 01:51:00,525
<i>When the red, red robin</i>
<i>Comes bob, bob, bobbin' along</i>

1353
01:51:00,701 --> 01:51:05,468
<i>When the red, red robin</i>
<i>Comes bobbity bobbin' along</i>

1354
01:51:05,639 --> 01:51:06,867
<i>Along</i>

1355
01:51:07,041 --> 01:51:09,601
<i>There'll be no more sobbin'</i>
<i>When he starts throbbin'</i>

1356
01:51:09,777 --> 01:51:13,178
<i>His old sweet song</i>

1357
01:51:13,347 --> 01:51:15,815
<i>Wake up, you sleepyhead...</i>

1358
01:51:15,983 --> 01:51:22,320
<i>Though the loves we leave behind</i>

1359
01:51:22,489 --> 01:51:27,722
<i>Change and fade away</i>

1360
01:51:28,162 --> 01:51:30,153
<i>Never mind</i>

1361
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:33,561
<i>You may be mine</i>

1362
01:51:33,734 --> 01:51:38,694
<i>Today</i>

1363
01:51:41,442 --> 01:51:44,138
<i>You sinners, drop everything</i>

1364
01:51:44,311 --> 01:51:46,836
<i>Let that harmony ring</i>

1365
01:51:47,014 --> 01:51:49,539
<i>Up to heaven and sing</i>

1366
01:51:49,717 --> 01:51:52,117
<i>Sing, you sinners</i>

1367
01:51:52,286 --> 01:51:54,550
<i>Just wave your arms all about</i>

1368
01:51:54,722 --> 01:51:57,520
<i>Raise your voices and shout</i>

1369
01:51:57,691 --> 01:52:00,125
<i>Pour that music right out</i>

1370
01:52:00,294 --> 01:52:02,319
<i>Sing, you sinners</i>

1371
01:52:03,230 --> 01:52:06,791
<i>Sometimes the cabin's gloomy</i>

1372
01:52:06,967 --> 01:52:11,904
<i>And the tables bare</i>

1373
01:52:12,072 --> 01:52:15,508
<i>Then he'll kiss me</i>

1374
01:52:15,676 --> 01:52:21,615
<i>And it's Christmas everywhere</i>

1375
01:52:21,782 --> 01:52:25,274
<i>Troubles fly away</i>

1376
01:52:25,586 --> 01:52:33,459
<i>And life is easy go</i>

1377
01:52:33,627 --> 01:52:38,291
<i>Does he love me good?</i>

1378
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:45,069
<i>That's all I need to know</i>

1379
01:52:45,873 --> 01:52:48,671
<i>Seems like happiness</i>

1380
01:52:49,943 --> 01:52:58,282
<i>Is just a thing called Joe</i>

1381
01:53:00,053 --> 01:53:03,318
<i>Little Joe</i>

1382
01:53:04,691 --> 01:53:08,320
<i>Little Joe</i>

1383
01:53:08,796 --> 01:53:13,893
<i>Little Joe</i>

1384
01:53:26,046 --> 01:53:27,741
Thank you.

1385
01:53:30,317 --> 01:53:32,911
Can't let
the entertainment committee down.

1386
01:53:33,821 --> 01:53:35,982
Burt, what is it?

1387
01:53:37,391 --> 01:53:39,018
Well, it's like I said.

1388
01:53:39,193 --> 01:53:41,423
You don't need a sponsor anymore.

1389
01:53:41,595 --> 01:53:44,223
You're back on your own feet now.
You stay that way.

1390
01:53:44,965 --> 01:53:47,900
But I didn't sing
for the entertainment committee.

1391
01:53:48,068 --> 01:53:49,660
I sang for you.

1392
01:53:49,837 --> 01:53:53,830
You sang because singing is your life.

1393
01:53:54,007 --> 01:53:55,372
It's your gift.

1394
01:53:55,542 --> 01:53:58,102
Now, share it with others.

1395
01:53:58,445 --> 01:54:00,140
With you.

1396
01:54:11,959 --> 01:54:13,654
Come in.

1397
01:54:20,868 --> 01:54:22,699
Hi, Burt.

1398
01:54:24,504 --> 01:54:25,528
Oh, Lil.

1399
01:54:25,706 --> 01:54:28,539
I haven't seen you around
these past few weeks.

1400
01:54:29,343 --> 01:54:31,038
Well, I've been around.

1401
01:54:31,211 --> 01:54:33,975
- Well, you weren't at the dance.
- No.

1402
01:54:38,585 --> 01:54:40,951
- Burt, I wanna talk.
- We've been all through this...

1403
01:54:41,121 --> 01:54:44,215
As my sponsor, I need your advice.

1404
01:54:44,491 --> 01:54:47,016
You remember the other night
after I sang?

1405
01:54:47,361 --> 01:54:49,886
Everybody called up
and congratulated me.

1406
01:54:50,063 --> 01:54:53,396
And Artie the agent's lined up
several bookings for me to go on tour.

1407
01:54:53,567 --> 01:54:56,161
Yes, I heard about it.
I'm very glad for you.

1408
01:54:56,737 --> 01:54:59,763
- That's just it.
- What?

1409
01:55:00,207 --> 01:55:02,767
They want me
on a national television show.

1410
01:55:02,943 --> 01:55:04,467
Wonderful.

1411
01:55:04,878 --> 01:55:06,675
But they don't want me to sing.

1412
01:55:06,847 --> 01:55:08,838
What do they want you to do?

1413
01:55:09,016 --> 01:55:11,075
They want me to come out
to California...

1414
01:55:11,251 --> 01:55:13,151
...and get up before 40 million people...

1415
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:16,517
...and tell the shameful, disgusting story
of my life.

1416
01:55:16,690 --> 01:55:19,056
End my comeback before we start it.

1417
01:55:19,226 --> 01:55:21,217
The story of your life?

1418
01:55:22,262 --> 01:55:24,696
I couldn't tell the story of my life.

1419
01:55:24,865 --> 01:55:26,856
I'd be too ashamed.

1420
01:55:27,935 --> 01:55:31,632
If you're sure you'd never slip back again,
this might do an awful lot of good.

1421
01:55:31,805 --> 01:55:35,866
If you ever did slip back,
it might do a great deal of harm.

1422
01:55:37,044 --> 01:55:40,070
- Are you telling me to do it?
- Oh, no, no, no.

1423
01:55:40,614 --> 01:55:43,606
- Are you telling me not to?
- I'm not telling you anything.

1424
01:55:45,352 --> 01:55:47,877
Burt, I came to you for help.

1425
01:55:48,055 --> 01:55:50,956
Look, Lil, this is graduation day.

1426
01:55:51,124 --> 01:55:54,218
This is your life, not mine, not Katie's.

1427
01:55:54,594 --> 01:55:57,028
You have to make this decision.

1428
01:55:59,232 --> 01:56:01,598
I can't make it by myself.

1429
01:56:02,836 --> 01:56:05,236
Whenever I've come to you before,
you've helped me.

1430
01:56:05,405 --> 01:56:07,236
Why is it so difficult for you now?

1431
01:56:07,407 --> 01:56:09,841
I've tried to tell you.
You don't wanna understand.

1432
01:56:10,010 --> 01:56:12,740
Can't you see?
You don't need me anymore.

1433
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:24,782
Burt...

1434
01:56:27,227 --> 01:56:30,754
...I know you're afraid
to let yourself love me.

1435
01:56:32,065 --> 01:56:34,056
But you're wrong, Burt.

1436
01:56:34,234 --> 01:56:35,997
You're wrong.

1437
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:39,204
Love me, Burt.

1438
01:56:40,273 --> 01:56:42,241
We belong together.

1439
01:56:42,409 --> 01:56:45,207
Together, we can help each other.

1440
01:56:49,516 --> 01:56:51,108
Together.

1441
01:57:03,630 --> 01:57:06,098
I love you, Lil.

1442
01:57:15,208 --> 01:57:16,971
Thank you very much. Hello, everybody.

1443
01:57:18,378 --> 01:57:21,711
Mr. Edwards is ready, Miss Roth.
I'll show you to your seats.

1444
01:57:21,882 --> 01:57:23,873
Everything all right?

1445
01:57:24,051 --> 01:57:26,485
- No regrets?
- I don't know.

1446
01:57:26,653 --> 01:57:29,850
I only know that you get by giving,
and this is all I've got to give.

1447
01:57:30,023 --> 01:57:33,288
<i>Our principal subject knows</i>
<i>that this is her life.</i>

1448
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:36,327
<i>We have her unqualified permission</i>
<i>to tell the whole truth.</i>

1449
01:57:36,663 --> 01:57:39,325
It's a story of degradation and shame.

1450
01:57:39,499 --> 01:57:42,832
But when you hear the facts,
you'll realize how much courage it took...

1451
01:57:43,003 --> 01:57:44,493
...for her to come here tonight.

1452
01:57:44,671 --> 01:57:47,640
You'll also realize
that it's a story full of hope...

1453
01:57:47,808 --> 01:57:50,003
...hope for many who are living
and suffering...

1454
01:57:50,177 --> 01:57:53,146
...in a half world of addiction to alcohol.

1455
01:57:53,313 --> 01:57:56,840
Hope for all people,
wherever and whoever they are.

1456
01:57:57,017 --> 01:58:01,477
So this is your life, Lillian Roth.

1457
