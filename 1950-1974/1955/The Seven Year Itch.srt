1
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:27,769
<i>Manhattan Island derives its name
from its earliest inhabitants...</i>

2
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,288
<i>...the Manhattan Indians.</i>

3
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:35,163
<i>They were a peaceful tribe,
setting traps, fishing, hunting.</i>

4
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:37,802
<i>There was a custom among them:</i>

5
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:41,489
<i>Every July, when the heat
became unbearable...</i>

6
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:45,248
<i>...they would send their wives
and children away.</i>

7
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,563
<i>Up the river to the highlands...</i>

8
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:51,726
<i>...or, if they could afford it,
to the seashore.</i>

9
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:56,285
<i>The husbands remained behind
to attend to business:</i>

10
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:00,845
<i>Setting traps, fishing and hunting.</i>

11
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:10,645
<i>Our story has nothing whatsoever
to do with Indians.</i>

12
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:14,169
<i>It plays 500 years later.</i>

13
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:19,362
<i>Portland, Rockland,
Plymouth and Bar Harbor.</i>

14
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,370
<i>Departing at 6:30...</i>

15
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:25,731
<i>We brought up the subject
to show how nothing has changed.</i>

16
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:29,608
<i>Manhattan wives and children
are still sent away in the summer.</i>

17
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:32,930
<i>Husbands remain behind
to attend to business:</i>

18
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,045
<i>Setting traps, fishing and hunting.</i>

19
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:40,571
<i>We want you to meet a typical
Manhattan husband.</i>

20
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:46,365
<i>This is Mr. Richard Sherman,
his wife, Helen, and son, Ricky.</i>

21
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,442
Ricky, what are you doing?

22
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:53,447
He's an interplanetary spy.
I blasted him into dust.

23
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:57,925
Cut it out. You're going to Maine,
not to Mars. Goodbye, Helen.

24
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:01,722
- Goodbye, Richard.
- Why can't Daddy come up with us?

25
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:06,649
- Daddy has to stay and make money.
- Don't worry. I'll be fine.

26
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:10,852
- How will I get my allowance?
- I'll mail it to you.

27
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:14,688
You promised to eat properly
and not smoke.

28
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,084
And you promised not to drink.

29
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,450
- I'll call you tonight at 10.
- Goodbye, Helen.

30
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:25,606
Goodbye, Ricky. Let me kiss you.

31
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:29,203
- Take that thing off.
- He's shutting off my oxygen!

32
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,762
Come on, we'll miss the train.

33
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:39,168
Helen, Ricky, the paddle!
You forgot the paddle!

34
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:43,042
- Ticket, mister?
- My son forgot the paddle.

35
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:48,447
Sorry, only those holding tickets
admitted through the gates.

36
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:03,370
Oh, no, not me.

37
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,923
And I'm not gonna smoke either.

38
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:11,167
Look at them. Awful. The train
isn't even out of the station.

39
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:15,762
Gotta get back to the office.
Man, is this hot!

40
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:20,005
<i>A few more facts
about Mr. Sherman:</i>

41
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,051
<i>He works for a publishing firm,
Brady & Company.</i>

42
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:27,809
<i>They publish those pocket editions,
two bits in any drugstore.</i>

43
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:32,763
<i>Old Mr. Brady is the boss,
but Mr. Sherman is the key man.</i>

44
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:35,481
<i>He keeps the whole operation together.</i>

45
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,770
<i>In the 25-cent book business,
you can sell anything.</i>

46
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:41,607
<i>Even the old, dreary classics.</i>

47
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:44,413
<i>The trick is to soup up the title...</i>

48
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:47,725
<i>...and get an interesting cover.</i>

49
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,045
<i>It's all a question of imagination...</i>

50
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:54,563
<i>...and Mr. Sherman has a lot
of imagination.</i>

51
00:05:57,893 --> 00:06:00,168
That'll be all, Miss Morris.

52
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:06,766
Oh, no, not me. Not me.

53
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,763
And I'm not gonna smoke either.

54
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:15,327
Some husbands run wild
because their wives are away.

55
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,609
Do anything they want.

56
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:20,890
Like Charlie Lederer.
Annie was gone two days...

57
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,522
...when Charlie got himself
tattooed.

58
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:27,288
Green dragon on his chest,
butterfly on the shoulders.

59
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,969
Not me. Oh, no, work, work...

60
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:35,532
I'll work till 6,
then have dinner at the saloon...

61
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:39,732
No! No saloon, no drinking
like Dr. Summers said.

62
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:43,648
I know, I'll try
that vegetarian restaurant.

63
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:46,168
Health food, that's the stuff.

64
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:49,962
<i>The human body
is a very delicate machine.</i>

65
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:52,886
<i>You can't run it on martinis
and goulash.</i>

66
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,363
<i>Especially in this hot weather.</i>

67
00:06:56,493 --> 00:07:00,566
- Miss, may I have the check, please?
- Yes, sir.

68
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:04,965
Let's see. We had the special,
the soybean hamburger...

69
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:06,931
...with French-fried soybeans.

70
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:09,767
Soybean sherbet and peppermint tea.

71
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:12,011
I had a cocktail to start.

72
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:15,723
Yes, we had the sauerkraut juice
on the rocks.

73
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:20,410
You'll be proud to know that the meal
was only 260 calories.

74
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,132
I am proud.

75
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:25,683
That'll be $1.27.

76
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:29,289
- Keep the change.
- We don't permit tipping.

77
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,093
I can put it in our nudist camp fund.

78
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,403
- You do that.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

79
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:39,010
It's a worthy cause. We must
bring the message to the people.

80
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:44,043
To unmask our suffocating bodies
and let them breathe again.

81
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:48,684
Without clothes
there'd be no sickness and no war.

82
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:52,642
Can you imagine two armies
on the battlefield...

83
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:55,088
...no uniforms, completely nude?

84
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:59,849
No way of telling friend from foe,
all brothers together.

85
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:03,972
Just a moment, sir.
You forgot your paddle.

86
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:06,772
Thank you.

87
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:21,685
I like this house.

88
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:25,044
Why does Helen want to move
into one of those...

89
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:28,006
<i>...buildings out of
Riot in Cellblock 11?</i>

90
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:31,046
So much nicer here.
Just three apartments.

91
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,124
Ours, Kaufmans upstairs...

92
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:38,163
...and two guys on the top,
interior decorators or something.

93
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,811
It's peaceful with everybody gone.
Sure is peaceful.

94
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:57,443
No Howdy Doody. No Captain Video.

95
00:08:57,693 --> 00:09:01,732
No smell of cooking.
No "What happened at the office?"

96
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:06,569
I shot Mr. Brady in the head,
made violent love to Miss Morris...

97
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:12,570
<i>...and set fire to 300,000 copies of
Little Women. That's what happened.</i>

98
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:18,802
What can happen at the office?
It sure is peaceful.

99
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:27,168
"Use the opener, Richard. "

100
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:43,725
"Carbonated water,
citric acid, corn syrup...

101
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:46,328
...artificial raspberry flavoring...

102
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:49,406
...vegetable colors and preservative. "

103
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:53,009
Why is this stuff better for you...

104
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:56,131
...than a little scotch
and a twist of lemon?

105
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,170
I'd really like to know.

106
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:02,171
Helen's gonna call at 10.

107
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,691
I guess I better do a little reading.

108
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,448
I brought Dr. Brubaker's
manuscript home with me...

109
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:17,809
Ricky!

110
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:22,843
Okay, where is it?
Where is the other one?

111
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:26,324
I know it's lurking here somewhere
to get me.

112
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:29,690
Where is Captain Video's
other roller skate?

113
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:34,971
Now, who's that?

114
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,805
- Yes, what is it?
- I'm sorry to bother you.

115
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,409
I forgot my key,
so I had to ring your bell.

116
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,564
It's perfectly all right.

117
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:04,767
Anytime. Anything else
I can do for you?

118
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:07,282
Would you mind pressing it again?

119
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,842
My fan's caught in the door.

120
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:12,971
Oh, of course.

121
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,441
- Thanks.
- Do you live in our building?

122
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:20,288
In the Kaufmans' apartment.
They're in Europe.

123
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:24,890
I know you'll be happy here.
It's a very quiet building.

124
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:28,443
No dogs, no children,
just two interior decorators.

125
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:30,763
And you, and of course, me.

126
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,923
- You all right?
- Oh, sure, fine.

127
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:37,572
Well, good night.

128
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,566
Good night.

129
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,164
Well, now.

130
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,928
Maybe I should have
asked her in for a drink.

131
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,485
Make her feel at home.
After all, we're one big family here.

132
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:05,771
Oh, no, no.

133
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:30,932
I've got to get to work
on the Brubaker book.

134
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:34,643
I'm gonna talk to him
about it tomorrow, so I better.

135
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:38,966
<i>Of Man and the Unconscious,
by Dr. Ludwig Brubaker.</i>

136
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:40,282
Some title.

137
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:44,526
We'll have to soup this one up,
that's for sure.

138
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,764
Ten o'clock.

139
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:56,364
Helen's not gonna call till 10:00.

140
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,766
I hope this thing
keeps me awake till 10:00.

141
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,728
Chapter three:

142
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,965
"The Repressed Urge
in the Middle-Aged Male.

143
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:10,767
Its Roots and Its Consequences. "

144
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:15,086
Helen has a lot of nerve
calling me at 10:00.

145
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,245
It shows a definite lack of trust.

146
00:13:18,573 --> 00:13:23,089
What does she think I'm gonna do?
Start smoking? Get drunk?

147
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:27,963
Or tattooed? Charlie...
Big, green dragon.

148
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:32,010
I bet she thinks I'll have
girls up here.

149
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:33,766
That's terrible.

150
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:38,723
Seven years we've been married.
I've never done anything like that.

151
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:43,888
Don't think I couldn't have either.
Because I could have, plenty.

152
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,164
Plenty.

153
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,485
Don't laugh, Helen.

154
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:56,089
I happen to be very attractive
to women.

155
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,530
You're attractive to me,
but I'm used to you.

156
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:03,049
This isn't a thing one likes
to tell his wife...

157
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:08,367
...but women have been throwing
themselves at me for years.

158
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:12,407
That's right, beautiful ones,
plenty of them.

159
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,964
- Acres and acres of them.
- Name one.

160
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:20,764
It's hard just offhand,
but there have been plenty of them.

161
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:24,802
You asked for it.
Take my secretary, for instance.

162
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:29,683
To you, she's just Miss Morris,
a piece of office furniture.

163
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:32,003
Ten fingers to type my letters.

164
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:34,767
Well, let me tell you.

165
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:38,131
- Did you type this letter?
- Yes, Mr. Sherman.

166
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:41,683
There are six errors
in the first paragraph.

167
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,969
What is the matter with you?

168
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:48,604
- What's the matter with you?
- I'll tell you what's the matter.

169
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:53,449
I'm in love with you.
I have been since the day I came here.

170
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:57,242
Deeply, madly, desperately,
all-consumingly.

171
00:14:57,493 --> 00:15:00,849
And to you I'm nothing,
just a piece of furniture.

172
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:03,732
Ten fingers to type your letters with.

173
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:08,649
Mr. Sherman, take a look at me.
I'm a woman, do you hear?

174
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:11,726
With flesh and blood
and nerves and feelings!

175
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:17,127
I'm in love with you.
I need you, I want you. I want you...

176
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,968
That will be all, Miss Morris.

177
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:41,928
You remember that torn shirt, Helen?
Now you know how it happened.

178
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:48,453
It got torn at the laundry, that's
how it happened. What an imagination!

179
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:51,772
You don't realize this
about women and me:

180
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:54,607
I walk into a room
and they sense it.

181
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,163
I arouse something in them,
I bother them.

182
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:02,770
It's a kind of animal thing I've got.
It's quite extraordinary.

183
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:06,164
The only extraordinary thing
is your imagination.

184
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:09,485
Last winter when I had
my appendix out...

185
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:11,888
...do you remember the nurse?

186
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:16,046
That sweet, little old lady
with the gray hair?

187
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:18,409
That was the day nurse.

188
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:23,488
You never saw the night nurse,
a certain Miss Finch.

189
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:28,011
Poor Miss Finch.
She fought it as long as she could.

190
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,450
- But then one night...
- Richard!

191
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:35,163
Miss Finch, please, not again tonight.

192
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:39,129
We have so little time.

193
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:44,367
Soon they'll take out your stitches
and I'll have lost you forever.

194
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:49,685
Please, Miss Finch.
There is such a thing as ethics.

195
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:52,811
Remember, you are a registered nurse.

196
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:58,173
Ethics? Once I had ethics.
Once I was young.

197
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:03,089
Once I had ideals. I was registered!
And then you happened.

198
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,849
Miss Finch, for five nights now
you've been taking my pulse.

199
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:11,927
Have you never noticed
this simple band of gold?

200
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:17,327
You've bothered me since they wheeled
you into the operating room.

201
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:22,169
I can't understand it.
There's this animal thing about you.

202
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:26,368
Please, Miss Finch, my adhesions.

203
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:30,208
Let's crash out of here.
Let's steal an ambulance.

204
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:34,162
You're not fit to wear that uniform.

205
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:36,563
You're rotten to the core.

206
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:41,567
Beat me till your arms ache.

207
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:44,805
I'll only come crawling back for more.

208
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:48,529
You're forcing me to take measures...

209
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:50,764
...to protect you from yourself.

210
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,564
No, no!

211
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:02,362
Put me down! Put me down!

212
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:12,531
The moth and the flame,
that's what it was.

213
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:17,164
Poor Miss Finch. I hope I didn't
singe her wings too badly.

214
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:21,122
You read too many books
and see too many movies.

215
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:28,173
For instance, take Elaine.
Your best friend, your bridesmaid.

216
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:32,372
Let me tell you about that weekend
in Westport last summer.

217
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:36,162
You were playing canasta,
suspecting nothing.

218
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:39,485
Elaine and I went for a walk. Walk!

219
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:43,567
We went swimming, moonlight swimming.

220
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:59,121
What is this strange animal thing
you have? It bothers me.

221
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:02,683
It's bothered me
since the first time I saw you.

222
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:07,165
And it'll bother me always,
from here to eternity.

223
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:18,043
You must fight it, Elaine.
Remember, I belong to another.

224
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:19,408
Richard!

225
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:24,773
This can never be. I have a devoted,
trusting wife at home.

226
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:28,801
And a freckle-faced
little space cadet.

227
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:31,364
Richard!

228
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,683
So, Helen, in light
of the circumstances...

229
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:55,005
...I resent your calling
to check up on me.

230
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:56,971
Don't worry about me.

231
00:19:57,213 --> 00:20:01,286
Although I have tremendous
personal magnetism...

232
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,172
...I also have strength of character.

233
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,722
And tremendous imagination.

234
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:12,172
You've begun to imagine it
Cinemascope, with stereophonic sound.

235
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:15,972
Well...

236
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:18,566
...back to work.

237
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,369
Chapter three:

238
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:28,850
"The Repressed Urge in the Middle-Aged
Male. Its Roots and Its Consequences. "

239
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:35,048
Helen is worried. I just know she is.

240
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,853
She plays it cool,
but she can't fool me.

241
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:41,881
Why else would she call
in the middle of the night?

242
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:46,684
She probably figures she isn't
as young as she was. She's 31.

243
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:50,608
One day she'll wake up
and find her looks are gone.

244
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:52,809
No wonder she's worried.

245
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:56,284
I don't look different
than I did when I was 28.

246
00:20:56,533 --> 00:21:00,367
It's not my fault, it's just
a simple biological fact.

247
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:02,922
Women age quicker than men.

248
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:08,042
I won't look different when I'm 60.
I have that kind of a face.

249
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:11,365
Everybody'll think she's my mother.

250
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:21,966
Hello, Mother?

251
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:24,284
Oh, Helen!

252
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,685
I wasn't expecting you to call
till 10. Everything all right?

253
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:33,449
Everything's fine here. Seems pretty
empty without you, though.

254
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,412
Just sitting out on the terrace...

255
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:40,407
...drinking, getting fractured
on raspberry soda.

256
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:45,083
Little Ricky okay? Oh, he did?

257
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,962
He hasn't done that for a long time.
It's the excitement.

258
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:51,965
That's nice.

259
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,567
Who did you meet on the train?
Tom MacKenzie?

260
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:00,969
What's he doing up there?

261
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:05,170
My advice is to avoid Tom
like the plague.

262
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:08,610
I don't want him
carrying Ricky's kayak.

263
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:12,209
If anybody carries Ricky's kayak,
it's gonna be you.

264
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,171
How's the weather? Cool?

265
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:18,881
It's steaming here, like an oven.

266
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:22,051
Yeah, I'm pretty tired myself.

267
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:25,172
Night. Good night, darling.

268
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:33,489
Chapter three:

269
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:36,611
"The Repressed Urge
in the Middle-Aged Male.

270
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:40,448
Its Roots and Its Consequences. "

271
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:45,970
Maybe a twist of lemon would help
this, or a shot of Worcestershire.

272
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:04,968
Hey, what's the big idea?!
You wanna kill somebody?

273
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:09,532
- What's the matter?
- This great cast-iron pot...

274
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:11,729
...practically killed me.

275
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,522
Oh, it's you. Well, hello again.

276
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:19,004
What happened?
Oh, the tomato plant fell over!

277
00:23:19,253 --> 00:23:20,402
It sure did.

278
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:23,372
- I'm terribly sorry.
- It's nothing.

279
00:23:23,613 --> 00:23:25,729
Look at that poor chair!

280
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:29,727
I'll pay for it. I hope it's not
some priceless antique.

281
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:34,882
- It's just early Sears, Roebuck.
- If there's anything I can do...

282
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:38,569
Do what? There's nothing
to worry about.

283
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:42,931
I'm certainly glad you're not mad.
Now don't touch it.

284
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,562
I'll have the janitor come down...

285
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:48,611
...and take care of it. Good night.

286
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:50,969
- Hey there! Wait a minute.
- Yes?

287
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:53,932
I'll tell you one thing you could do.

288
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:57,449
If you're not doing anything else
more important.

289
00:23:57,693 --> 00:24:00,253
Would you have a drink with me?

290
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:03,372
- Thanks, I'd love it.
- You would?

291
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:04,847
Sure, it'd be fun.

292
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:10,167
Let me just go and put something on.
I get dressed in the kitchen.

293
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:15,123
When it's hot like this,
I keep my undies in the icebox.

294
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:19,131
- In the icebox?
- See you in a minute.

295
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:25,004
In the icebox!

296
00:24:58,093 --> 00:25:01,563
I really need it, Dr. Murphy.
Honest I do.

297
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:07,968
Don't worry, Dr. Murphy.
Just one, that's all.

298
00:25:20,613 --> 00:25:24,492
All those lovely
injurious tars and resins.

299
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:28,009
And now a small concession
from Dr. Summers?

300
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:44,324
Doctor, let's be reasonable.
Can't fly on one wing.

301
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:47,451
Okay, I'll put some soda in it.

302
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:59,769
"Do you want to come in for a drink?"
"I'd love it. "

303
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:01,571
Just like that.

304
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:08,123
A beautiful girl too.
Must be a model or actress.

305
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:30,089
Atmosphere.
I need a little atmosphere.

306
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:35,769
Tomato plant.

307
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:38,648
Fan caught in the door.

308
00:26:41,693 --> 00:26:45,163
What am I doing?
This is absolutely ridiculous.

309
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:49,611
The first night Helen leaves,
I'm bringing dames in here.

310
00:26:58,853 --> 00:26:59,853
Take it easy.

311
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:05,252
There's nothing wrong with asking
a neighbor down for a drink.

312
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:08,413
I hope she doesn't get the wrong idea.

313
00:27:08,653 --> 00:27:13,408
If this dame thinks she's in for
a big time, she's in for a surprise.

314
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:17,043
One drink and out!
I'm a happily married man.

315
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:19,763
Maybe a little soft music.

316
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:23,561
She's probably getting all fixed up.

317
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:27,647
She'll probably wear
some ice-cold evening dress.

318
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:33,013
Let's see. Debussy, Ravel.

319
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:37,166
Stravinsky.
Stravinsky'd only scare her.

320
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:42,007
Here's the baby, Rachmaninoff.
Give her the full treatment.

321
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:44,363
Come in like gangbusters.

322
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:52,967
Good old Rachmaninoff.

323
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:57,252
The Second Piano Concerto.
Never misses.

324
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:30,004
You came. I'm so glad.

325
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:38,169
- Rachmaninoff.
- The Second Piano Concerto.

326
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:42,168
- It isn't fair.
- Not fair? Why?

327
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:46,402
- Every time I hear it, I go to pieces.
- Oh?

328
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,763
May I sit next to you?

329
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:55,171
Please do.

330
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:20,172
It shakes me, it quakes me.

331
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:23,012
It makes me goose-pimply all over.

332
00:29:23,253 --> 00:29:28,043
I don't know where I am,
or who I am, or what I'm doing.

333
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:33,048
Don't stop, don't stop.
Don't ever stop.

334
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:38,885
- Why did you stop?
- You know why I stopped.

335
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:42,045
- Why?
- Because.

336
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:45,490
Because now I'm going to kiss you...

337
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:48,372
...very quickly and very hard.

338
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,364
One moment, my dear.

339
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:17,971
You came.

340
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:21,412
Yeah, I came for the rugs.

341
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,121
The rugs? What is it you want?

342
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:27,126
The bedroom rugs.
I promised Mrs. Sherman.

343
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:28,373
Mr. Kruhulik...

344
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:31,929
- It's on account of the moths.
- Forget the rugs.

345
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:36,371
Your wife is gonna find them
full of big, gaping holes.

346
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:39,002
Who'll get blamed? The janitor.

347
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:42,768
Pick them up tomorrow
while I'm at the office.

348
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:47,882
I can't. I'm taking the missus
and the kids to the train.

349
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:52,923
- They're going to the country.
- All right, in the afternoon then.

350
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:58,293
I can't do it then. I'm going
to the barber in the afternoon.

351
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:03,448
I'm gonna take a shave,
haircut, manicure, the whole works.

352
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:07,971
I couldn't care less.
Come tomorrow evening, just not now.

353
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:13,082
Tomorrow evening?
Do you know the maid from 531 Park?

354
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:17,929
You must've seen her walking
down the street with her fat poodle.

355
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:19,486
What?

356
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:24,289
Come now, we're both summer bachelors.
Don't let's be naive.

357
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,330
Good night, Mr. Kruhulik!

358
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:30,843
Big, fat poodle! He's got four kids.

359
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:35,450
Something happens to people
in the summer. It's disgraceful.

360
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:40,404
It's late. Where is she?
This is ridiculous.

361
00:31:40,653 --> 00:31:44,771
She could've been here,
had her drink and gone home already.

362
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:46,924
Ice, we'll need ice.

363
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:52,926
Coming!

364
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,332
Coming, coming!

365
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:12,732
Hi!

366
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:15,363
It's me. Don't you remember?

367
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:17,569
The tomato from upstairs.

368
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,930
Of course, the tomato.
Come in, please.

369
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,733
Honestly, I don't know
how it happened.

370
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:27,886
I was watering the plants.
I promised the Kaufmans I would.

371
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:32,206
I was using the cocktail shaker.
It's the only thing I found.

372
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:37,049
A little silver one.
Then there was this terrible crash.

373
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:41,969
You could've been killed.
It's probably criminal negligence.

374
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:45,285
You could've sued somebody.
Me, probably.

375
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:49,970
Well, not you. You'd have been dead.
Your lawyers could have.

376
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:53,364
Case dismissed.
What would you like to drink?

377
00:32:53,613 --> 00:32:58,129
I don't know. Anything.
You have a nice place here.

378
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:02,571
- You live here alone?
- Yes, I live here alone. All alone.

379
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:08,527
- It's a roller skate. Mine, you know.
- Yours?

380
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:13,642
It's adjustable. I skate a lot.
What would you like to drink?

381
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:17,044
- You do drink?
- Sure, I drink like a fish.

382
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:21,206
- Do you have gin?
- Of course. You mean straight gin?

383
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:24,923
No, gin and soda, I guess.

384
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:29,963
- Gin and soda?
- That's wrong. How do you drink gin?

385
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:35,128
There's gin and tonic, and gin
and vermouth, that's a martini.

386
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:40,128
That sounds cool. I'll have a glass
of that. A big, tall one.

387
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:44,327
Big, tall martini.

388
00:33:57,013 --> 00:34:00,244
This is a nicer apartment
than the Kaufmans'.

389
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:03,326
For instance,
the Kaufmans have no stairs.

390
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:07,602
- Hey, where do they lead to?
- No place.

391
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:12,529
No place? A stairway to nowhere.
That's elegant.

392
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:17,244
I wouldn't say elegant.
You see, this used to be a duplex.

393
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:22,647
The landlord made two apartments
out of it by boarding up your floor.

394
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:26,968
Oh, yes, I remember that patch
in the floor.

395
00:34:27,213 --> 00:34:29,932
I dropped my cuticle pusher
down the crack.

396
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:32,289
Cuticle pusher. Yeah.

397
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:36,287
Well, here you are. Big, tall martini.

398
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,650
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

399
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,972
Very good.
Maybe it needs a bit more sugar.

400
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:47,842
I'd strongly advise against
putting sugar in a martini.

401
00:34:48,093 --> 00:34:51,130
- You would? Why?
- Well...

402
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:55,003
Take my word for it.
No sugar in a martini.

403
00:34:55,253 --> 00:34:58,290
Back home they put sugar in martinis.

404
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:02,526
- Back home? Where?
- Denver, Colorado.

405
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:05,526
Hey, you've got air conditioning!

406
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:09,485
- How does it work? Put it on.
- Sure!

407
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:14,125
I got air conditioning in every room.
Don't the Kaufmans?

408
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:19,652
No, it's just terrible up there.
That's why I bought the electric fan.

409
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:25,169
This feels just elegant.
I'm just not made for the heat.

410
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:28,928
It's my first summer in New York,
and it's killing me.

411
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:32,768
Yesterday,
I tried to sleep in the bathtub.

412
00:35:33,013 --> 00:35:35,607
Just lying up to my neck
in cold water.

413
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,286
Good idea.

414
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:42,004
But the faucet kept dripping.
It was keeping me awake.

415
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:46,849
You know what I did?
I pushed my big toe up the faucet.

416
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:49,609
They call that American know-how.

417
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:53,687
Then my toe got stuck
and I couldn't get it out again.

418
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:55,048
You couldn't?

419
00:35:55,293 --> 00:36:00,048
But there's a phone in the bathroom.
I was able to call the plumber.

420
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:01,362
You called him?

421
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:05,322
He was very nice,
even though it was Sunday.

422
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:08,531
He rushed right over.

423
00:36:09,613 --> 00:36:11,092
Everything come out okay?

424
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:15,963
- Sure. But it was embarrassing.
- I can see how it might've been.

425
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:18,363
Honestly, I almost died.

426
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:21,332
There I was with a strange plumber...

427
00:36:21,573 --> 00:36:24,133
...and no polish on my toenails.

428
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:34,732
- You got a cigarette around?
- A cigarette? Sure.

429
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:36,526
Coming up.

430
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:56,768
- Here you are.
- Are you afraid of burglars?

431
00:36:57,013 --> 00:37:00,164
I'm just trying not to smoke.
The theory is:

432
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:04,929
If you don't see them,
you don't think about them.

433
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:10,568
<i>It's not 100%/foolproof.
It's only a theory.</i>

434
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:15,603
All you do is spend half your life
dragging ladders back and forth.

435
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:19,129
You could break a leg.
It's just ridiculous.

436
00:37:19,373 --> 00:37:22,683
At the club we had this girl
who only smoked cigars.

437
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:26,528
She only did it
to make herself look older.

438
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:32,649
- What club was that?
- This club I lived at.

439
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:35,726
I hated it.
You had to be in by 1 a. m.

440
00:37:35,973 --> 00:37:38,487
Now I can stay out all night.

441
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:43,045
I was glad when they
practically asked me to leave.

442
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:46,524
- Why did they ask you to leave?
- It was so silly.

443
00:37:46,773 --> 00:37:51,767
<i>I posed for a picture in
U.S. Camera and they got all upset.</i>

444
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:53,969
What was wrong with the picture?

445
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:58,923
I was... It was one of these
artistic pictures.

446
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:02,843
On the beach, with driftwood.

447
00:38:03,093 --> 00:38:06,483
<i>- It got honorable mention.
- In U.S. Camera?</i>

448
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:10,806
It was called "Textures. "
You'd see three different kinds.

449
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:14,932
The driftwood, the sand and me.
I got $25 an hour.

450
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:19,610
- It took hours and hours.
- Very interesting line of work.

451
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:24,802
I don't do modeling anymore.
Now I'm on TV every other week.

452
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,011
<i>- The Dazzledent Toothpaste Hour.
- You're an actress?</i>

453
00:38:28,253 --> 00:38:30,687
Sort of. I do the commercial part.

454
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,608
It's a good part.
They put gray makeup on my teeth...

455
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:37,413
...to show ordinary toothpaste.

456
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:41,089
Then they wipe it off
to show how Dazzledent works.

457
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:44,769
I sit like this
for about 14 seconds...

458
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:47,402
...and I get to speak lines too.

459
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:51,328
"I had onions at lunch,
I had garlic dressing at dinner.

460
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:55,248
But he'll never know.
I stay kissing-sweet...

461
00:38:55,493 --> 00:38:58,326
...the new Dazzledent way. "

462
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:03,252
- You do that beautifully.
- Thank you.

463
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:07,281
People don't realize,
but when I show my teeth on TV...

464
00:39:07,493 --> 00:39:09,643
...I appear before more people...

465
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:13,971
...than Sarah Bernhardt ever did.
Something to think about.

466
00:39:14,213 --> 00:39:16,124
It certainly is.

467
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:20,965
Wish I were old enough to have
seen her. Was she magnificent?

468
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:26,171
I wouldn't know.
I'm not that old myself.

469
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:28,165
I guess you're not really.

470
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:31,769
I'm 39. I will be in August.
At the moment I'm 38.

471
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:35,523
Thirty-eight? I was 22,
day before yesterday.

472
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:39,129
I didn't do anything about it.
I didn't tell anyone.

473
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:42,012
I did buy a bottle of champagne.

474
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,171
I thought I'd sit there,
drink it by myself.

475
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:48,405
- That sounds absolutely sad.
- Oh, no!

476
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:53,169
It would've been just elegant,
lying in a bath, drinking champagne.

477
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:58,612
- But I couldn't get the bottle open.
- You couldn't? There's nothing to it.

478
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:01,448
You think you could get it open?

479
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,888
I'm pretty sure I could.

480
00:40:04,093 --> 00:40:06,926
I've got an idea.
I'll go up and get it.

481
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:09,687
It's in the icebox with the potato
chips and my underwear.

482
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:12,367
- Do you have champagne glasses?
- Yes.

483
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:15,173
Good! We'll have a wonderful time.

484
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,325
The man says it's very good champagne.

485
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:25,761
- Shall I bring the potato chips too?
- Sure, let's shoot the works.

486
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:32,848
<i>Honorable mention in U.S. Camera.</i>

487
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,972
<i>U.S. Camera.</i>

488
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:51,809
"News Events. Children and Animals.
The Human Body. "

489
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:14,328
Champagne glasses. Champagne glasses.

490
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,327
Phone, phone. Where's the phone?

491
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:45,243
Hello? Who is it?

492
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:48,690
Oh, Helen. Well, this is a surprise!

493
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:52,289
And a pleasant one. How are you?

494
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:55,923
Sure, I'm all right.
Why shouldn't I be all right?

495
00:41:56,173 --> 00:42:00,086
In what way do I sound funny?
Everything is just fine.

496
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:04,246
What's your problem?
Did I know Ricky forgot his paddle?

497
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:08,645
I've been dragging that thing
all over New York. Sure, I will.

498
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:12,488
I'll send it off first thing.
Good night.

499
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:17,045
Who? Who dropped in after dinner?
Tom MacKenzie?

500
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:19,932
Good old Tom. How is he?

501
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:24,804
Drinking? Who, me?
Whatever gave you that idea?

502
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:28,966
I was sitting here reading
a book about driftwood.

503
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:33,650
We may publish it. It's interesting.
Some of the formations are...

504
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:39,685
I'd better hang up.
The bathtub is running over.

505
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,527
Good night. Night!

506
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:51,133
Sorry, I was on the phone.
A friend of mine in the country...

507
00:42:51,373 --> 00:42:54,092
Oh, say!

508
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,972
It isn't right to drink champagne
in pants.

509
00:42:57,213 --> 00:42:59,727
Would you mind fastening my straps?

510
00:43:00,053 --> 00:43:03,125
Oh, sure. Sure.

511
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:08,928
Potato chips, champagne.
You really think you can get it open?

512
00:43:09,493 --> 00:43:14,487
Oh, yeah. I've opened one or two
before in my life.

513
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:18,726
It's simply a matter of pressure
and counter-pressure.

514
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:22,283
- There she goes.
- You've sure got powerful thumbs.

515
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:26,367
I used to play a lot of badminton.
Get the glasses.

516
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:29,131
Quick, quick! The glasses!

517
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:34,322
- Pour it.
- Seems to be stuck.

518
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:37,133
That's silly. Give it a good yank.

519
00:43:39,013 --> 00:43:40,685
This never happened before.

520
00:43:40,933 --> 00:43:44,369
It must be the vacuum.
The bubbles create a vacuum.

521
00:43:44,613 --> 00:43:46,524
Let me see if I can do it.

522
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,130
I'll try to twist it.

523
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:57,204
- You're married!
- I am? Yes, I am.

524
00:43:57,453 --> 00:44:01,128
I knew it. I could tell.
You look married.

525
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:06,164
Actually, my wife and I are separated.

526
00:44:06,573 --> 00:44:10,282
Separated in the sense
that she went away for the summer.

527
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:14,731
- Any children?
- No. Well, just one very little one.

528
00:44:14,973 --> 00:44:17,362
It's cold in there.
Finger's getting numb.

529
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,491
I could call the plumber.
He's very good at this.

530
00:44:20,733 --> 00:44:23,327
No, let's keep the plumber out of it.

531
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:25,803
Grab hold of the piano.

532
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:29,326
Careful, I had my appendix out
last year.

533
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:35,807
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

534
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:41,642
Do you wanna waste it
now that you know I'm married?

535
00:44:41,893 --> 00:44:46,364
I think it's wonderful
that you're married. Just elegant.

536
00:44:46,613 --> 00:44:48,092
- You do?
- Of course.

537
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:53,453
I wouldn't be lying on the floor
with some man if he wasn't married.

538
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:56,161
That's an interesting
line of reasoning.

539
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:59,052
With a married man it's so simple.

540
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:02,603
I mean, it can't possibly
ever get drastic.

541
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:13,732
- Have a potato chip.
- In what sense can't it get drastic?

542
00:45:13,973 --> 00:45:18,205
- People keep falling in love with me.
- I can believe it.

543
00:45:18,453 --> 00:45:23,288
- They get this strange idea.
- I believe that too.

544
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:25,444
They ask me to marry them.

545
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:28,924
All the time.
I don't know why they do it.

546
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:33,166
- Maybe it's a kind of nervousness.
- Maybe.

547
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:36,689
I don't wanna get married.
Not yet, anyway.

548
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:40,764
That'd be worse than living
at the club.

549
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:43,049
I'd have to get in by 1 again.

550
00:45:43,293 --> 00:45:46,330
Very true, you would.
At least occasionally.

551
00:45:46,573 --> 00:45:49,565
That's what's wonderful
about a married man.

552
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,771
No matter what,
he can't ask you to marry him.

553
00:45:53,013 --> 00:45:56,130
- He's married already. Right?
- Right.

554
00:45:59,773 --> 00:46:05,131
You certainly don't have to worry
about me. Am I ever a married man!

555
00:46:05,373 --> 00:46:09,651
I'm the most married man
you'll ever know. And I promise...

556
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:15,052
...I will never ask you to marry me,
come what may.

557
00:46:16,093 --> 00:46:18,926
- Well, how about some music?
- Fine.

558
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:22,882
Let's see what we've got here.

559
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:27,251
Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky.

560
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,245
Hey, how about this one?

561
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:32,690
Rachmaninoff,
the Second Piano Concerto.

562
00:46:32,933 --> 00:46:36,448
You look to me
like a big Rachmaninoff girl.

563
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:40,368
I do? Funny, I don't know
anything about music.

564
00:46:40,613 --> 00:46:45,528
You don't have to.
Just listen to it, that's all.

565
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:59,048
This is classical music, isn't it?
I can tell. There's no vocal.

566
00:47:02,493 --> 00:47:03,926
Don't talk.

567
00:47:04,893 --> 00:47:06,485
Don't fight it.

568
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:09,930
Relax. Go limp.

569
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:13,367
- Like this?
- Yes.

570
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:16,127
Let it sweep over you.

571
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:29,329
I got the biggest thing
for Eddie Fisher.

572
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:37,046
Frequently, people go to pieces
listening to this.

573
00:47:37,293 --> 00:47:39,648
- No kidding?
- Yes.

574
00:47:40,053 --> 00:47:43,966
It quakes them. It shakes them.

575
00:47:44,213 --> 00:47:48,126
Makes them goose-pimply all over.

576
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:51,326
Did you ever dunk a potato chip
in champagne?

577
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:55,851
It's real crazy. Here.

578
00:47:56,093 --> 00:48:00,484
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah, pretty crazy.

579
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:05,602
We'd better send Rachmaninoff off.
This wasn't such a good idea.

580
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:08,811
Don't worry, everything's fine.

581
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,772
A married man, air conditioning...

582
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:16,370
...champagne and potato chips.
It's a wonderful party.

583
00:48:16,613 --> 00:48:20,686
<i>Hey! Look, you've got U.S. Camera!</i>

584
00:48:20,973 --> 00:48:23,931
I do? How about that!

585
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:26,125
<i>I've got U.S. Camera.</i>

586
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:31,493
I bought a dozen copies of this
but people kept stealing them.

587
00:48:31,733 --> 00:48:33,724
Why would they do that?

588
00:48:34,493 --> 00:48:37,326
That's me, right there on the beach.

589
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:41,682
My hair was a little longer then.
Did you notice?

590
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:45,482
No, I didn't.
Let me ask you something.

591
00:48:45,733 --> 00:48:49,487
When they took this,
there must've been some passersby.

592
00:48:49,733 --> 00:48:53,362
Other people around.
How did they keep the crowd back?

593
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:57,526
It was taken early in the morning.
Nobody was up.

594
00:48:57,773 --> 00:49:02,563
- Except... You see that shadow?
- Is it a sea gull?

595
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:06,806
No, a coast guard helicopter.
He kept buzzing the beach.

596
00:49:07,053 --> 00:49:10,568
Maybe you'd like me to autograph
this before I leave.

597
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:13,247
You're not leaving yet,
are you?

598
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,530
- How about more champagne?
- Love some.

599
00:49:19,093 --> 00:49:20,924
Just freshen it.

600
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:25,330
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

601
00:49:25,573 --> 00:49:26,972
Here.

602
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,603
We should have some music.
Do you play the piano?

603
00:49:33,853 --> 00:49:38,324
Not really. Not anymore. I used to.
Just a little as a child.

604
00:49:38,573 --> 00:49:42,532
- Go ahead, play something.
- Well, all right.

605
00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:49,852
Let's see if I remember this.
It's a little tricky.

606
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:13,126
"Chopsticks"! I can play that too.
Shove over.

607
00:50:34,453 --> 00:50:39,083
I don't know about that Rachmaninoff,
but this really gets me.

608
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,528
- It does?
- And how.

609
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:54,172
- I can feel the goose pimples.
- Goose pimples?

610
00:50:59,213 --> 00:51:00,931
Don't stop.

611
00:51:01,573 --> 00:51:02,926
Don't stop.

612
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:07,403
- Why do you stop?
- You know why.

613
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:12,681
Because now I'm going to take you
in my arms and kiss you...

614
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:15,606
...very quickly and very hard.

615
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:17,730
Hey, wait a minute!

616
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:27,572
- What happened? I lost track.
- I don't know.

617
00:51:27,813 --> 00:51:30,885
This is terrible.
There's nothing I can say.

618
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:34,205
Except that I'm terribly sorry.

619
00:51:34,453 --> 00:51:36,967
Nothing like this ever happened
to me before.

620
00:51:37,213 --> 00:51:40,489
This happens to me all the time.

621
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:42,286
This is unforgivable.

622
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:46,606
The only possible excuse is
that I'm not quite myself tonight.

623
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:50,289
Maybe it'd be better
if you would just go.

624
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:55,687
- Why? You're being silly.
- Please go. I must insist.

625
00:51:58,293 --> 00:52:00,727
Take your potato chips and go.

626
00:52:02,813 --> 00:52:05,930
All right, if you really want me to.

627
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,929
- Good night.
- Good night.

628
00:52:14,453 --> 00:52:16,523
I think you're very nice.

629
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:25,926
Nice! You're not nice. You're crazy,
that's what you are.

630
00:52:26,173 --> 00:52:30,291
Helen's gone for one day
and you're running amuck.

631
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:35,812
Smoking, drinking, picking up girls,
playing "Chopsticks. "

632
00:52:37,693 --> 00:52:42,244
You're not gonna live through
this summer. Not like this.

633
00:52:47,053 --> 00:52:48,850
Look at those bloodshot eyes.

634
00:52:49,093 --> 00:52:52,608
Look at that face, ravaged,
dissipated, evil.

635
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:56,084
One morning you'll look in the mirror
and that's all.

636
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:58,722
<i>The Portrait of Dorian Gray.</i>

637
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:23,694
- Good morning, Mr. Sherman.
- Good morning, Miss Morris.

638
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:28,538
- Mr. Brady get in yet?
- Yes, he came in early.

639
00:53:28,782 --> 00:53:32,855
- I wanna see him. Put this on my desk.
- Of course.

640
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:36,139
Would you like me to get
coffee and a doughnut?

641
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:37,417
No, thank you.

642
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:40,813
Have you had breakfast,
with the family away?

643
00:53:41,062 --> 00:53:44,054
I'm capable of fixing
my own breakfast.

644
00:53:44,302 --> 00:53:48,818
I had a peanut butter sandwich
and two whiskey sours.

645
00:53:53,262 --> 00:53:56,493
- Mr. Brady.
- Oh, Sherman, come in.

646
00:53:58,462 --> 00:53:59,690
Well, what is it?

647
00:53:59,942 --> 00:54:05,141
I've been with this company for years,
and I've never asked for a favor.

648
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:08,971
- You had a raise in February.
- I'm not talking about that.

649
00:54:09,182 --> 00:54:11,173
This is more important than money.

650
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:16,132
I want two weeks off to join
my wife and son in the country.

651
00:54:16,382 --> 00:54:20,853
This is our busy season.
We're preparing our fall list.

652
00:54:21,102 --> 00:54:22,740
I'm very tense and upset.

653
00:54:22,982 --> 00:54:27,612
I'm on the verge of a breakdown.
If I could get back with my wife...

654
00:54:27,862 --> 00:54:30,740
- How long have you been married?
- Seven years.

655
00:54:30,982 --> 00:54:35,373
In a few years, you'll be delighted
to get rid of them for the summer.

656
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:39,820
Shipped them to Nantucket
yesterday afternoon...

657
00:54:40,062 --> 00:54:42,656
...and I haven't been to bed since.

658
00:54:45,062 --> 00:54:50,090
Drank bourbon, smoked cigars,
played poker till this morning.

659
00:54:50,342 --> 00:54:53,459
Came to the office.
Never felt better in my life.

660
00:54:53,702 --> 00:54:59,493
I may not go to bed at all till
the family gets back in September.

661
00:55:00,022 --> 00:55:01,694
If I stay in New York alone...

662
00:55:01,942 --> 00:55:05,651
...there's a chance I may not live
to see September.

663
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:10,100
That's ridiculous, Sherman.
You're just a little lonely.

664
00:55:10,342 --> 00:55:14,460
What about us teaming up tonight,
seeing if we can get lucky?

665
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:17,136
It doesn't have to be just poker.

666
00:55:17,382 --> 00:55:20,818
We'll cut loose
and have us a real hootenanny.

667
00:55:21,062 --> 00:55:26,056
It's very kind of you, but
I don't think... No hootenannies.

668
00:55:26,302 --> 00:55:31,330
Suit yourself, but I've been
thinking about that fall list.

669
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:35,211
What would you think
of a 25-cent reprint...

670
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:39,501
<i>- ... of The Portrait of Dorian Gray?
- Dorian Gray?</i>

671
00:55:39,742 --> 00:55:43,815
Look what we'll be giving them
for a quarter!

672
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:47,771
Vice, lust and corruption.
The story of a young man:

673
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:51,697
On the surface, clear-eyed
and healthy, just like you.

674
00:55:51,942 --> 00:55:54,615
But underneath, dry rot.

675
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:59,936
The termites of sin and depravity,
gnawing at his soul.

676
00:56:00,182 --> 00:56:02,332
How does that strike you?

677
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:06,013
No, no. No.

678
00:56:07,342 --> 00:56:08,491
Chapter six:

679
00:56:08,742 --> 00:56:12,815
"The Infidelity Pattern
in the Married Male...

680
00:56:13,062 --> 00:56:14,654
...or the 'seven-year itch. '

681
00:56:14,902 --> 00:56:19,339
A study of 18,000 marriages
conducted by myself...

682
00:56:19,582 --> 00:56:23,495
...leads us to believe that
the 'urge curve' in the husband...

683
00:56:23,742 --> 00:56:26,620
...rises sharply during
the seventh year.

684
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:29,934
This phenomenon is humorously...

685
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:33,094
...referred to
as the seven-year itch.

686
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:36,739
Far from humorous,
this unfortunate urge...

687
00:56:36,982 --> 00:56:41,214
<i>...strikes 84.6%/
of the married male population...</i>

688
00:56:41,462 --> 00:56:46,138
<i>...rising to an alarming 91.8%/
during the summer months. "</i>

689
00:56:55,342 --> 00:56:57,094
Changed my mind.

690
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:11,337
"Case history A: Gustaf Meyerheim,
the mad lover of Leipzig.

691
00:57:14,102 --> 00:57:18,493
An extreme, but not unusual
case of the seven-year itch...

692
00:57:18,742 --> 00:57:22,018
...occurred in Leipzig,
Germany in 1912.

693
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:26,335
Gustaf Meyerheim, happily married
for seven years...

694
00:57:26,582 --> 00:57:29,335
...suddenly... " Seven years!

695
00:57:34,582 --> 00:57:39,053
- Dr. Brubaker to see Mr. Sherman.
- Doctor, you're early.

696
00:57:39,302 --> 00:57:43,090
Yes, my 3:00 patient
jumped out of the window.

697
00:57:43,342 --> 00:57:46,095
So I'm ahead of schedule.
Which door?

698
00:57:46,342 --> 00:57:48,094
This one.

699
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:54,932
- Good afternoon, Mr. Sherman.
- Dr. Brubaker.

700
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:58,174
I see you've been working on my book.

701
00:57:58,422 --> 00:58:01,494
It's a wonderful book.
Very important.

702
00:58:01,742 --> 00:58:04,017
- It has something for everyone.
- Yes.

703
00:58:04,262 --> 00:58:08,778
You'll be happy to know
that we're giving it a big promotion.

704
00:58:09,022 --> 00:58:13,015
You'll be seeing this
in every drugstore in America.

705
00:58:13,262 --> 00:58:17,221
- "Of Sex and Violence"?
- We had to soup up the title.

706
00:58:17,462 --> 00:58:19,817
What does this represent?

707
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:23,611
Gustaf Meyerheim,
the mad lover of Leipzig...

708
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:27,138
...terrorizing one of his victims.
Isn't that sensational?

709
00:58:27,382 --> 00:58:32,012
May I remind you that Meyerheim
was small, with a red beard?

710
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:33,900
Nobody knows that.

711
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:35,780
They know it in Leipzig.

712
00:58:36,022 --> 00:58:39,537
And all his victims
were middle-aged women.

713
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:43,058
Don't you think it'd be
more effective...

714
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:46,772
...to show a man terrorizing
a young girl, sales-wise?

715
00:58:47,022 --> 00:58:51,334
I'm not a salesman. I'm a doctor.
I heal sick minds.

716
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:56,736
I find ways to root out insecurities,
neuroses, inner tensions...

717
00:58:57,942 --> 00:59:01,571
- What is it? What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

718
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:08,411
- Does that mean something, doctor?
- No, nothing serious.

719
00:59:08,662 --> 00:59:13,019
- Dark clouds on the psychic horizon.
- That's preposterous.

720
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:16,618
A twitch in a thumb,
a nerve or a muscle.

721
00:59:16,862 --> 00:59:21,811
You psychiatrists make a case
out of it. Of all the ridiculous...

722
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,656
- Are you very expensive?
- Very.

723
00:59:24,902 --> 00:59:27,541
- I'm sure you make exceptions.
- Never.

724
00:59:27,782 --> 00:59:30,296
If a case really interests you?

725
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:33,335
At $50 an hour,
all my cases interest me.

726
00:59:33,582 --> 00:59:38,133
If you run into something spectacular,
another Gustaf Meyerheim...

727
00:59:38,382 --> 00:59:41,613
You wouldn't believe this,
but last night...

728
00:59:41,862 --> 00:59:46,811
...I found myself terrorizing
a young lady.

729
00:59:47,062 --> 00:59:49,781
That could account for the thumb.

730
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:54,379
Actually, it wasn't that bad.
I just made a little boo-boo.

731
00:59:54,622 --> 00:59:58,058
Psychoanalysis doesn't recognize
the boo-boo as such.

732
00:59:58,302 --> 01:00:00,452
Everything is unconscious.

733
01:00:00,702 --> 01:00:02,658
I was completely conscious.

734
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:06,258
I told her to take
her potato chips and go.

735
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:10,290
- Potato chips. If you please...
- All right, doctor.

736
01:00:13,662 --> 01:00:16,335
I'm in serious trouble. I'm married.

737
01:00:16,582 --> 01:00:20,336
"Serious trouble. Married. "
So far, normal.

738
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:22,732
I've been married for seven years.

739
01:00:22,982 --> 01:00:26,861
I'm coming down with what you call
the seven-year itch.

740
01:00:27,102 --> 01:00:31,618
- What am I going to do?
- If something itches, scratch.

741
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:35,901
I scratched. There was this lady.
Everything went black.

742
01:00:36,142 --> 01:00:39,532
I terrorized her,
I attempted to terrorize her.

743
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:42,057
The attempt was unsuccessful?

744
01:00:42,302 --> 01:00:47,251
Definitely. All I did was knock
us both off the piano bench.

745
01:00:47,462 --> 01:00:50,454
Let me understand.
You attempted to terrorize...

746
01:00:50,702 --> 01:00:53,500
...a young lady on a piano bench?

747
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:56,096
Yes.

748
01:00:56,822 --> 01:01:00,701
And on whose person
was this attempt committed?

749
01:01:01,302 --> 01:01:04,692
Here, doctor. I brought this with me.

750
01:01:04,942 --> 01:01:08,332
I didn't wanna leave it
lying around the house.

751
01:01:08,782 --> 01:01:10,613
That's her.

752
01:01:10,862 --> 01:01:13,615
Her hair was a little longer then.

753
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:22,936
It's called "Textures" because
you can see three different textures.

754
01:01:23,142 --> 01:01:24,575
It got honorable mention.

755
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:28,536
Splendid. I congratulate you
on your good taste.

756
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:31,740
Interesting driftwood formation too.

757
01:01:31,982 --> 01:01:35,975
I'll give you my advice.
Do not attempt it again.

758
01:01:36,222 --> 01:01:39,498
But if you should,
give yourself room to work in.

759
01:01:39,742 --> 01:01:43,417
Do not attempt it balanced
on a piano bench.

760
01:01:43,662 --> 01:01:45,334
Such an attempt is doomed.

761
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:48,858
- I love my wife.
- Don't we all? Your time is up.

762
01:01:49,102 --> 01:01:54,051
If you find yourself in need
of further analysis, phone my office.

763
01:01:54,302 --> 01:01:58,853
As for my book, we'll resume
discussion as your... has subsided.

764
01:01:59,102 --> 01:02:04,176
If she tells anybody about this,
I'll kill her with my bare hands.

765
01:02:04,422 --> 01:02:05,855
A possible solution.

766
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:10,095
But murder is the most difficult
crime to commit.

767
01:02:10,342 --> 01:02:13,334
Until you can commit
a simple act of terror...

768
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:18,212
...I strongly advise you
to avoid anything so complex.

769
01:02:18,462 --> 01:02:22,421
One must learn to walk
before one can run. Goodbye.

770
01:02:29,302 --> 01:02:31,213
I'm in big trouble.

771
01:02:32,222 --> 01:02:35,055
Girls like this can't keep
their mouths shut.

772
01:02:35,302 --> 01:02:37,816
This'll be all over New York.

773
01:02:38,062 --> 01:02:42,499
I bet right this minute
she's telling someone about it.

774
01:02:42,902 --> 01:02:47,771
He lured me in his apartment.
He made me sit on his piano bench.

775
01:02:48,022 --> 01:02:51,776
He made me play "Chopsticks. "
Then he turned on me.

776
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:54,536
He was frothing at the mouth...

777
01:02:54,742 --> 01:02:58,417
...just like the creature from
the Black Lagoon!

778
01:03:00,142 --> 01:03:02,178
I knew it. I knew it!

779
01:03:02,422 --> 01:03:06,973
That's how these stories get started.
Big blabbermouth.

780
01:03:07,222 --> 01:03:09,861
Then he lured her
into his apartment...

781
01:03:10,102 --> 01:03:14,892
...pretended he wasn't married.
He forced her onto the piano bench.

782
01:03:15,142 --> 01:03:19,579
I know him very well. He was
in here for dinner, 260 calories.

783
01:03:19,822 --> 01:03:22,859
He forced her to sit
on the piano bench...

784
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:26,617
...and then he
made her play "Chopsticks. "

785
01:03:28,182 --> 01:03:33,381
The word is spreading. It's spreading.
It's like jungle drums.

786
01:03:33,822 --> 01:03:37,576
Everybody knows about it.
Everybody's talking about it.

787
01:03:38,662 --> 01:03:42,177
Television!
I forgot she's on television.

788
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:44,936
50 million TV sets in America.

789
01:03:45,182 --> 01:03:48,015
And now with the coaxial cable...!

790
01:03:48,902 --> 01:03:53,214
I had onions at lunch.
I had garlic dressing at dinner.

791
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,418
But he'll never know...

792
01:03:55,622 --> 01:04:01,413
...because I stay kissing-sweet
the new Dazzledent way.

793
01:04:04,462 --> 01:04:08,694
Now that I have your attention,
I want to warn all you girls...

794
01:04:08,942 --> 01:04:12,218
...about an evil, dangerous,
married man...

795
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:14,692
...living downstairs in my building.

796
01:04:14,942 --> 01:04:17,900
<i>His name is Richard Sherman.</i>

797
01:04:18,142 --> 01:04:21,418
<i>S- H-E-R-M-A-N.</i>

798
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:24,415
<i>While his wife and son are in Maine...</i>

799
01:04:24,662 --> 01:04:28,257
<i>...this monster is terrorizing
the girls of New York.</i>

800
01:04:28,502 --> 01:04:32,017
Mommy, come quick!
They're talking about Daddy.

801
01:04:32,262 --> 01:04:35,254
<i>He makes them sit
on the piano bench...</i>

802
01:04:35,502 --> 01:04:37,936
<i>...and makes them play "Chopsticks. "</i>

803
01:04:38,182 --> 01:04:40,980
<i>Then suddenly he turns on them...</i>

804
01:04:41,222 --> 01:04:44,771
<i>...just like the creature from
the Black Lagoon!</i>

805
01:04:47,822 --> 01:04:50,017
Well, I might as well face it.

806
01:04:50,902 --> 01:04:55,020
She knows everything.
She knows, she knows, she knows.

807
01:04:55,782 --> 01:05:00,298
But maybe she doesn't.
Maybe there isn't any TV up in Maine.

808
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:04,615
I can't go on like this.
Why don't I just call Helen?

809
01:05:04,862 --> 01:05:09,413
The minute I heard her voice,
I could tell if she knew anything.

810
01:05:09,662 --> 01:05:11,812
All right, call her.

811
01:05:15,702 --> 01:05:19,411
Hello, long distance?
I want Ogunquit, Maine.

812
01:05:19,662 --> 01:05:24,213
Ogunquit-42831 J. Yeah, thanks.

813
01:05:25,142 --> 01:05:30,341
What's taking so long? Maybe she's
talking to the lawyers already.

814
01:05:30,702 --> 01:05:35,537
Hello, hello? Helen? Bad connection.

815
01:05:35,782 --> 01:05:38,854
Who? Who is this?

816
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:41,662
I wanna talk to Mrs. Sherman.

817
01:05:41,902 --> 01:05:46,532
Who is this? Oh, the babysitter.

818
01:05:46,782 --> 01:05:50,741
Look, this is Mr. Sherman.
Where is Mrs. Sherman?

819
01:05:51,102 --> 01:05:54,060
What do you mean she's on a hayride?

820
01:05:54,302 --> 01:05:57,135
With whom is she on a hayride?

821
01:05:57,902 --> 01:06:00,211
Mr. MacKenzie and some people?

822
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:03,020
What people?

823
01:06:04,662 --> 01:06:09,019
She did leave a message?
What was the message?

824
01:06:10,582 --> 01:06:15,610
Ricky's paddle. No, I forgot.
Something came up.

825
01:06:15,862 --> 01:06:19,571
I'll send it first thing
in the morning. Goodbye!

826
01:06:19,822 --> 01:06:22,734
- Mr. Sherman?
- What is it, Miss Morris?

827
01:06:22,982 --> 01:06:26,054
It's after 6.
Do you need me anymore tonight?

828
01:06:26,302 --> 01:06:29,817
No. We've come to the end
of a perfect day.

829
01:06:30,062 --> 01:06:33,372
Let's go home and enjoy
the simple things.

830
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:38,412
The good things, the real things.
The laughter of a child.

831
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:42,575
A flight of swallows winging
their way back home.

832
01:06:42,822 --> 01:06:45,461
Life can be beautiful, Miss Morris.

833
01:07:01,062 --> 01:07:02,211
Hey!

834
01:07:03,182 --> 01:07:04,410
Good evening.

835
01:07:05,302 --> 01:07:07,179
I just washed my hair.

836
01:07:08,342 --> 01:07:11,493
That's nice. Goodbye.

837
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:20,055
Oh, no, not tonight.
This girl's a pistol.

838
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:23,419
Got away with it once.
Why press my luck?

839
01:07:27,742 --> 01:07:32,372
It's gonna be quiet around here
tonight. I promise you that.

840
01:07:32,622 --> 01:07:38,219
Take a shower, poach an egg,
rinse a shirt, hit the sack...

841
01:07:38,742 --> 01:07:40,095
...and that's all.

842
01:08:00,262 --> 01:08:04,574
If she was washing her hair
for me, is she kidding?

843
01:08:07,022 --> 01:08:10,731
Helen, what a wife!
How lucky can you get?

844
01:08:10,982 --> 01:08:13,257
I'm glad she's having a good time.

845
01:08:13,502 --> 01:08:17,700
People to go out with,
take her on hayrides.

846
01:08:19,502 --> 01:08:24,212
One thing, though. What's she doing
on a hayride with MacKenzie?

847
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:27,773
I wish she wouldn't hang around
people like that.

848
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:30,058
He's capable
of making a pass at her.

849
01:08:30,302 --> 01:08:33,453
She'll probably like it.
She's getting older.

850
01:08:33,702 --> 01:08:37,775
I'm probably very dull.
And MacKenzie is a writer.

851
01:08:38,022 --> 01:08:42,095
A lousy writer.
That last book of his!

852
01:08:42,342 --> 01:08:45,459
All that downwardly pulsating...

853
01:08:45,702 --> 01:08:48,455
...and hair spilled across the pillow.

854
01:08:48,702 --> 01:08:53,412
No woman is safe around a guy
who writes stuff like that.

855
01:09:08,022 --> 01:09:11,617
No, Tom, please. The other people!

856
01:09:11,862 --> 01:09:15,411
I have a confession to make.
Look around.

857
01:09:18,182 --> 01:09:22,016
- There are no other people.
- Don't be angry.

858
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:24,014
I should be.

859
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:27,540
No, Tom. What about the driver?

860
01:09:27,782 --> 01:09:31,616
- There is no driver.
- No driver?

861
01:09:31,862 --> 01:09:35,741
I thought of everything.
Even the horses are wearing blinkers.

862
01:09:36,182 --> 01:09:40,460
- Tom, I'm afraid.
- Afraid? Of me?

863
01:09:40,702 --> 01:09:43,614
No, of me.

864
01:09:44,742 --> 01:09:48,576
Oh, darling!
Downwardly, pulsating, striving.

865
01:09:48,822 --> 01:09:51,894
Now together, ending and unending.

866
01:09:52,142 --> 01:09:55,817
Now, now, now!

867
01:09:56,502 --> 01:10:00,415
What a cornball. Okay, good luck.

868
01:10:00,662 --> 01:10:05,417
If that's the way you wanna play it,
I can play it that way too!

869
01:10:15,862 --> 01:10:18,422
Kaufman. Kaufman. Kaufman.

870
01:10:31,662 --> 01:10:36,816
Hi! Did you know you left your
tomato plant down here last night?

871
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:41,017
I'd be glad to bring it up.

872
01:10:42,782 --> 01:10:45,819
Maybe you'd like to have dinner.

873
01:10:47,582 --> 01:10:51,211
Then maybe we could
go to an air-conditioned movie.

874
01:11:06,782 --> 01:11:09,899
Didn't you love the picture? I did.

875
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:14,294
But I just felt so sorry
for the creature at the end.

876
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:18,455
Sorry? What, did you want him
to marry the girl?

877
01:11:18,702 --> 01:11:23,059
He was scary-looking,
but he wasn't really all bad.

878
01:11:23,302 --> 01:11:25,941
He just craved a little affection.

879
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:29,970
A sense of being loved
and needed and wanted.

880
01:11:30,222 --> 01:11:32,895
That's an interesting point of view.

881
01:11:33,262 --> 01:11:35,730
Do you feel the breeze
from the subway?

882
01:11:35,982 --> 01:11:38,018
Isn't it delicious?

883
01:11:43,102 --> 01:11:47,732
Sort of cools the ankles.
What would be fun to do now?

884
01:11:47,982 --> 01:11:50,860
- It's getting pretty late.
- Not that late.

885
01:11:51,102 --> 01:11:54,458
I have this big day tomorrow.
I have to get to sleep.

886
01:11:54,702 --> 01:11:55,851
What's the big day?

887
01:11:56,102 --> 01:12:00,732
<i>Tomorrow I'm on TV.
I told you, The Dazzledent Hour.</i>

888
01:12:01,662 --> 01:12:03,812
Oh, here comes another one.

889
01:12:08,982 --> 01:12:13,373
Tell me, Dazzledent toothpaste,
I don't think I ever tried it.

890
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:17,740
You should. It's excellent.
Oh, yes, I use it myself.

891
01:12:17,982 --> 01:12:21,452
- Then you do recommend it?
- Definitely.

892
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:26,822
It costs a little more,
but 8 out of 10 oral hygienists...

893
01:12:27,062 --> 01:12:30,816
You sound like a commercial.
If I believed commercials...

894
01:12:31,062 --> 01:12:34,577
- You can believe this one.
- What's that you say?

895
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:39,737
"He'll never know. I stay kissing-
sweet the new Dazzledent way"?

896
01:12:39,982 --> 01:12:44,373
- Now really.
- It's true! I'll prove it to you.

897
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:49,175
Well?

898
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:53,057
My faith in the integrity
of advertising is restored.

899
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:58,740
However, before I switch brands,
I wanna make absolutely certain.

900
01:13:03,782 --> 01:13:07,411
A successful businessman
like Kaufman...

901
01:13:07,662 --> 01:13:09,300
...probably makes 15,000 a year.

902
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:14,457
Spends a fortune on sculptures
but will not put in air conditioning.

903
01:13:14,702 --> 01:13:17,933
I bet it was 95
in the bedroom last night.

904
01:13:18,182 --> 01:13:20,218
Poor kid, it's awful.

905
01:13:22,622 --> 01:13:23,622
Good night.

906
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:27,138
If you wanted to drop by my place
to cool off...

907
01:13:27,382 --> 01:13:30,658
...before you face that Turkish bath
up there...

908
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:35,373
I left the air conditioning
on full blast. It's cold in there.

909
01:13:35,622 --> 01:13:40,457
- Maybe for a few minutes.
- To bring the body temperature down.

910
01:13:41,182 --> 01:13:44,140
I feel no matter how much it costs...

911
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:47,533
...if you've got to sell
the kids' bonds...

912
01:13:47,782 --> 01:13:50,455
...I say in the summertime
in New York...

913
01:13:50,702 --> 01:13:53,500
...you've got to have
air conditioning.

914
01:13:54,902 --> 01:13:56,415
Just feel that.

915
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:06,095
I didn't tell you, but I have
air conditioning in every room.

916
01:14:06,342 --> 01:14:09,254
The kitchen, the bathroom,
the bedroom.

917
01:14:09,502 --> 01:14:12,414
- Heaven!
- You just relax.

918
01:14:12,662 --> 01:14:17,213
I'll fix two drinks,
and we'll have a nice, quiet talk.

919
01:14:28,622 --> 01:14:30,852
This is really the most!

920
01:14:32,742 --> 01:14:35,256
Well, what shall we talk about?

921
01:14:35,502 --> 01:14:38,221
How about psychoanalysis?

922
01:14:38,622 --> 01:14:43,616
I don't know how much you know
about it, but it's a hobby of mine.

923
01:14:43,822 --> 01:14:47,895
I like to wander through the labyrinth
of the human mind.

924
01:14:48,142 --> 01:14:52,260
What gets me is spending $3.95
for that miserable fan.

925
01:14:52,502 --> 01:14:54,333
It's absolutely useless.

926
01:14:54,582 --> 01:14:58,052
I'll take it back to the store
to get my money back.

927
01:14:58,302 --> 01:15:01,692
Just hope I didn't
lose the sales slip.

928
01:15:02,462 --> 01:15:04,578
Two days ago we were strangers...

929
01:15:04,822 --> 01:15:07,814
...and now you're here alone with me.

930
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:11,141
How did it happen? Why did we meet?

931
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:14,738
The answer lies in the unconscious.

932
01:15:14,982 --> 01:15:20,010
If they won't take back the fan,
the larger size is only $3 more.

933
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:25,131
But what about tonight?
I've just got to get some sleep.

934
01:15:25,382 --> 01:15:30,376
You think that plant fell by itself?
There are no accidents.

935
01:15:30,622 --> 01:15:33,375
Nothing happens by itself.
We make it happen.

936
01:15:33,622 --> 01:15:37,740
You didn't accidentally brush
the plant, you pushed it.

937
01:15:37,982 --> 01:15:42,851
Maybe if I took the fan,
put it in the icebox...

938
01:15:43,102 --> 01:15:45,058
...and left the door open...

939
01:15:45,302 --> 01:15:50,740
...then left the bedroom door open
and soaked the sheets in ice water...

940
01:15:50,982 --> 01:15:53,576
No, that's too icky.

941
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,057
Your behavior is obvious.

942
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:59,135
You pushed the plant down to kill me.

943
01:15:59,382 --> 01:16:01,771
And why do you suppose you wanted to?

944
01:16:02,022 --> 01:16:06,618
Could it be, could it possibly be
because you love me?

945
01:16:10,102 --> 01:16:15,222
Of course I could simply ask him if...
I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

946
01:16:16,382 --> 01:16:18,612
He's such a nice man.

947
01:16:19,182 --> 01:16:23,972
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Under this veneer we're all savages.

948
01:16:24,222 --> 01:16:27,453
Man, woman, hopelessly enmeshed.

949
01:16:27,702 --> 01:16:31,820
We're on a toboggan, we can't stop.
It's too late to run.

950
01:16:32,062 --> 01:16:34,212
The beguine has begun.

951
01:16:35,142 --> 01:16:37,212
What are we going to do?

952
01:16:39,182 --> 01:16:42,857
I've been thinking about it and I...

953
01:16:43,102 --> 01:16:44,694
Yes?

954
01:16:44,902 --> 01:16:48,019
I'd like to stay here
with you tonight.

955
01:16:48,782 --> 01:16:50,818
I'd like to sleep here.

956
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:58,417
- Are you sure?
- That is, if you don't mind.

957
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:03,973
It's not a question of minding.
We don't wanna rush into this.

958
01:17:04,222 --> 01:17:08,693
There are savages, and savages.
This may be too savage.

959
01:17:08,942 --> 01:17:11,376
If you want to spend an hour here...

960
01:17:11,622 --> 01:17:14,420
Don't make me go
to that hot apartment.

961
01:17:14,662 --> 01:17:19,656
I haven't slept in three nights.
I'd like to look good tomorrow.

962
01:17:19,902 --> 01:17:23,053
I could sleep right here
in this chair.

963
01:17:23,302 --> 01:17:27,773
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
You won't know I'm around. Please?

964
01:17:29,782 --> 01:17:34,936
Well, that's different.
Of course you can sleep here.

965
01:17:35,182 --> 01:17:38,140
We're not savages.
We're civilized people.

966
01:17:38,382 --> 01:17:42,455
- Thank you. What time do you get up?
- About 8, I guess.

967
01:17:42,702 --> 01:17:47,332
- I'll fix you breakfast.
- Fix my breakfast... Wait a minute.

968
01:17:47,582 --> 01:17:51,814
Suppose someone sees
you leaving the apartment at 8.

969
01:17:52,062 --> 01:17:54,451
Just one person sees you,
and we're dead.

970
01:17:54,702 --> 01:17:59,492
All right then, I could get up
at 6 and sneak upstairs.

971
01:17:59,742 --> 01:18:02,131
Get up at 6 and sneak... Sneak!

972
01:18:02,382 --> 01:18:06,261
Even worse. Suppose someone sees you
sneaking out?

973
01:18:06,502 --> 01:18:08,652
We're not doing anything wrong.

974
01:18:08,902 --> 01:18:13,293
Certainly, but there's such
a thing as society, laws, rules.

975
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:16,614
But after all, no man is an island.

976
01:18:22,942 --> 01:18:27,060
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mr. Kruhulik.

977
01:18:40,942 --> 01:18:43,695
- What is it?
- I was just coming home.

978
01:18:43,942 --> 01:18:48,060
Went out with a lady,
the one with the big, fat poodle.

979
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:53,171
I saw your light. I thought it might
be a good time to pick up the rugs.

980
01:18:53,422 --> 01:18:56,414
At 1:30 in the morning?
Are you out of your mind?

981
01:18:56,662 --> 01:18:58,414
I promised your wife.

982
01:18:58,662 --> 01:19:03,531
Those moths are probably right now
chewing away big, gaping holes.

983
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:06,342
Stop worrying.
I give you my word...

984
01:19:06,582 --> 01:19:09,016
...the moths are not eating anything.

985
01:19:09,262 --> 01:19:13,016
Come tomorrow, early,
before they have their breakfast.

986
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:16,140
You can't trust a moth, Mr. Sherman.

987
01:19:16,382 --> 01:19:18,100
They get hungry at night...

988
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:22,017
...so they start looking around
for a snack and...

989
01:19:28,142 --> 01:19:31,771
- Oh, I wish I was dead.
- What's the matter?

990
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:35,981
I'm sorry. I didn't quite
understand the situation.

991
01:19:36,222 --> 01:19:39,692
In a situation like this,
who cares about moths?

992
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,820
Situation, Mr. Kruhulik?
What situation?

993
01:19:47,062 --> 01:19:49,622
Moths? Let them eat the rugs.

994
01:19:49,862 --> 01:19:52,615
Let them eat the curtains. Who cares?

995
01:19:53,262 --> 01:19:55,617
Go, man, go.

996
01:19:57,022 --> 01:20:00,856
I'd like to explain this.
This may seem unusual.

997
01:20:01,102 --> 01:20:04,731
- But it's the most natural thing.
- I'll say.

998
01:20:04,982 --> 01:20:09,931
"Summertime, and the living is easy.
Fish are jumping, cotton is high. "

999
01:20:10,182 --> 01:20:14,255
That's enough! The young lady
lives in this building.

1000
01:20:14,502 --> 01:20:17,335
- There's been a terrible accident.
- Hi.

1001
01:20:17,982 --> 01:20:20,815
Well, hello!

1002
01:20:22,182 --> 01:20:25,219
Isn't she a living doll?

1003
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:28,461
This lady's tomato plant fell down.

1004
01:20:28,702 --> 01:20:32,138
Sorry to disappoint,
but that's all there is to it.

1005
01:20:32,382 --> 01:20:35,021
In fact, I'm glad you dropped in.

1006
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:39,297
You can help her take
the plant upstairs. It's here.

1007
01:20:39,542 --> 01:20:42,375
I watered the garden
with a cocktail shaker.

1008
01:20:42,622 --> 01:20:44,214
A little silver shaker.

1009
01:20:44,462 --> 01:20:47,659
You can see your insinuations
are preposterous.

1010
01:20:47,902 --> 01:20:50,735
A natural mistake, Mr. Sherman.

1011
01:20:50,982 --> 01:20:55,612
And my apologies to you, dear lady.
What a doll!

1012
01:20:55,862 --> 01:20:59,571
- Right out here, Mr. Kruhulik.
- What a shambles.

1013
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:03,861
It's all right.
We're covered. I have a policy.

1014
01:21:05,982 --> 01:21:08,780
Thank you, Mr. Kruhulik,
and good night.

1015
01:21:09,022 --> 01:21:12,458
Good night, Miss...
Whatever your name is.

1016
01:21:12,782 --> 01:21:15,535
Be careful, it's heavy.
Don't strain anything.

1017
01:21:15,782 --> 01:21:17,261
I'm strained already...

1018
01:21:17,502 --> 01:21:22,622
...from carrying that big,
fat poodle around. I wish I was dead!

1019
01:21:23,862 --> 01:21:27,411
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

1020
01:21:28,582 --> 01:21:32,052
I'm sorry.
But you can see how it is.

1021
01:21:32,302 --> 01:21:35,612
I understand. No man is an island.

1022
01:21:44,582 --> 01:21:45,810
Normal.

1023
01:21:48,262 --> 01:21:50,901
Everything is absolutely normal.

1024
01:21:51,182 --> 01:21:53,332
Sleep. Go to sleep.

1025
01:21:53,582 --> 01:21:55,812
How can I possibly sleep?

1026
01:21:56,782 --> 01:21:58,215
What'll I do?

1027
01:21:59,862 --> 01:22:04,652
Helen. Write to Helen.
Write a long letter to Helen.

1028
01:22:06,022 --> 01:22:09,651
Paddle, that's it.
I've got to send the paddle.

1029
01:22:09,902 --> 01:22:13,941
Little Ricky out there on the lake
without a paddle.

1030
01:22:14,182 --> 01:22:18,573
Wrap the paddle and send it off
in the morning. Ricky needs it.

1031
01:22:18,822 --> 01:22:23,976
Going to get his paddle.
How do you wrap a paddle, anyway?

1032
01:22:24,222 --> 01:22:26,611
Paper and string, what else?

1033
01:22:27,782 --> 01:22:31,013
I need a piece of paper the shape
of a paddle.

1034
01:22:40,742 --> 01:22:42,812
All right, nothing.

1035
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:48,421
Hey, there's some gauze
in the bathroom.

1036
01:22:48,662 --> 01:22:52,450
I can bandage the whole thing,
put some tape on it and...

1037
01:22:52,702 --> 01:22:56,217
And what, send it up in an ambulance?

1038
01:22:58,822 --> 01:23:00,858
This is ridiculous.

1039
01:23:01,102 --> 01:23:04,856
People send paddles every day.
The mails are full of them.

1040
01:23:05,102 --> 01:23:07,218
How do they do it?

1041
01:23:09,582 --> 01:23:12,779
That's it, old newspapers!

1042
01:23:13,142 --> 01:23:15,372
Big deal, old newspapers.

1043
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:19,217
Get a lot of string,
slap it together...

1044
01:23:37,302 --> 01:23:38,621
Hi.

1045
01:23:41,662 --> 01:23:46,816
Forgot about the stairs. It was
so easy. I pulled out the nails.

1046
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:52,412
You know what?
We can do this all summer.

1047
01:24:41,742 --> 01:24:43,937
Miss. Young lady.

1048
01:24:44,702 --> 01:24:48,741
I've got to take a shower.
Got to get to the office.

1049
01:24:48,982 --> 01:24:53,817
Please, lady, get up, go home
so I can get to the office.

1050
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:57,220
Please, lady? No?

1051
01:25:47,422 --> 01:25:51,017
Poor kid, working in New York
in this heat.

1052
01:25:51,262 --> 01:25:55,778
And on television! Standing there
under those hot lights.

1053
01:25:58,942 --> 01:26:01,615
She must need money real bad.

1054
01:26:01,862 --> 01:26:06,697
Lives in an expensive apartment.
I know what clothes cost.

1055
01:26:06,942 --> 01:26:09,410
Buys imported champagne.

1056
01:26:10,102 --> 01:26:12,696
How can she possibly afford...?

1057
01:26:12,942 --> 01:26:15,217
She must have
other sources of income.

1058
01:26:16,262 --> 01:26:20,972
Plenty of ways a girl can get money
if she's unscrupulous enough.

1059
01:26:21,222 --> 01:26:26,171
She could get herself some foolish,
well-to-do married man.

1060
01:26:26,422 --> 01:26:28,856
Trap him into some situation.

1061
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:33,812
Bleed him till he's white,
squeeze him till he's dry...

1062
01:26:35,382 --> 01:26:40,217
They have a word for this.
They call it "blackmail. "

1063
01:26:50,662 --> 01:26:53,620
Where is she? She's with Kruhulik.

1064
01:26:53,862 --> 01:26:57,821
They're down at the bank
going through my safe-deposit box.

1065
01:27:04,222 --> 01:27:07,214
Hello, are you in there?

1066
01:27:07,462 --> 01:27:12,217
Hi, good morning! Just taking
a shower. Be out in a minute.

1067
01:27:17,342 --> 01:27:21,096
Taking a shower, she'll be out
in a minute, that's all.

1068
01:27:21,342 --> 01:27:25,620
I should get one of the new towels
and take it to her.

1069
01:27:27,782 --> 01:27:31,377
That would very definitely
be another boo-boo.

1070
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:37,854
If anyone were to walk in,
would they ever get the wrong idea.

1071
01:27:38,102 --> 01:27:43,130
Cinnamon toast for two, strange blond
in the shower. Explain that.

1072
01:27:43,382 --> 01:27:47,011
Tell them you spent the night
wrapping a paddle.

1073
01:27:50,422 --> 01:27:52,060
Anybody walk in here!

1074
01:27:52,302 --> 01:27:57,296
Who's gonna walk in here?
J. Edgar Hoover? Arthur Godfrey?

1075
01:27:57,542 --> 01:27:59,214
Helen, maybe?

1076
01:28:05,102 --> 01:28:09,015
She's in Maine.
How could she get here?

1077
01:28:10,982 --> 01:28:15,692
On the train, that's how.
On the early morning train.

1078
01:28:15,942 --> 01:28:20,811
Why would she be coming to New York?
Because she knows something.

1079
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:24,771
Because someone tipped her off.
Who could've tipped...?

1080
01:28:25,022 --> 01:28:27,934
Kruhulik!
He saw the girl here last night...

1081
01:28:28,182 --> 01:28:32,221
...called Helen long distance
and told her everything.

1082
01:28:32,462 --> 01:28:37,377
She's on the train, I know it.
Early morning train's in already.

1083
01:28:37,622 --> 01:28:42,457
She's in a cab. She's on her way here.
She'll be here any second!

1084
01:28:50,382 --> 01:28:53,931
There's a woman in this apartment.
I know there is.

1085
01:28:54,182 --> 01:28:58,539
- No, Helen, it's not true.
- Don't lie to me, Richard.

1086
01:28:58,782 --> 01:29:01,979
Who told you? Was it Kruhulik?

1087
01:29:02,222 --> 01:29:06,659
That's right.
I've had him watching you for months.

1088
01:29:07,262 --> 01:29:12,416
His name's not Kruhulik. He's
a private eye named Johnny Dollar.

1089
01:29:12,662 --> 01:29:15,938
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to shoot you.

1090
01:29:16,182 --> 01:29:19,891
I can explain everything.
The cinnamon toast, the shower.

1091
01:29:20,142 --> 01:29:21,575
This girl's from Denver.

1092
01:29:21,822 --> 01:29:26,657
The Kaufmans have no air conditioning.
Spend a fortune on sculpture.

1093
01:29:26,902 --> 01:29:31,180
The drugstore wouldn't
take back her fan, she lost the slip.

1094
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:36,450
So I let her sleep in our bed.
I was just wrapping the paddle.

1095
01:29:37,422 --> 01:29:41,654
At least have the decency to keep
the paddle of a child...

1096
01:29:41,902 --> 01:29:43,494
...out of this sordid mess.

1097
01:29:45,222 --> 01:29:48,214
You're mad.
You'll never get away with this.

1098
01:29:48,462 --> 01:29:52,740
Yes, I will. There's such a thing
as the unwritten law.

1099
01:29:52,982 --> 01:29:54,620
Goodbye, Richard.

1100
01:29:57,462 --> 01:30:01,501
- Give me another chance!
- They'll give me a medal.

1101
01:30:01,742 --> 01:30:05,018
The wives of America
will give me a medal!

1102
01:30:17,022 --> 01:30:21,493
Helen, I'm going fast.
Give me a cigarette.

1103
01:30:21,742 --> 01:30:26,896
A cigarette! You know what
Dr. Murphy told you about smoking.

1104
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:32,014
A cigarette.

1105
01:30:34,702 --> 01:30:37,170
Just one more cigarette, Dr. Murphy.

1106
01:30:38,102 --> 01:30:40,218
One more for the road.

1107
01:30:40,582 --> 01:30:42,812
For the long, long road.

1108
01:30:44,862 --> 01:30:46,011
Hi.

1109
01:30:47,662 --> 01:30:51,132
- What are you doing?
- I need a cigarette.

1110
01:30:51,342 --> 01:30:54,220
They're right there on the table.

1111
01:30:55,462 --> 01:30:59,011
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm all shot.

1112
01:30:59,262 --> 01:31:03,221
It's because I took your bed
and you slept on the couch.

1113
01:31:03,462 --> 01:31:06,181
I knew I should've taken the couch.

1114
01:31:06,422 --> 01:31:08,617
It's not the couch, it's my wife.

1115
01:31:08,862 --> 01:31:12,377
- She found out about us and shot me.
- She what?

1116
01:31:12,622 --> 01:31:16,410
Five times in the back
and twice in the belly.

1117
01:31:16,782 --> 01:31:19,216
You're just having a bad dream.

1118
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:22,815
Yeah, I guess so.

1119
01:31:24,022 --> 01:31:27,298
Come on now. Everything's fine.

1120
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:32,656
It's just my imagination.
Some people have flat feet.

1121
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:37,578
- I have this appalling imagination.
- I think it's just elegant.

1122
01:31:37,822 --> 01:31:42,657
I just have no imagination at all.
I have lots of other things.

1123
01:31:43,022 --> 01:31:46,617
I was standing in the kitchen.
Then it occurred to me.

1124
01:31:46,862 --> 01:31:51,697
If my wife walked in with you in the
shower, she'd probably shoot me.

1125
01:31:51,942 --> 01:31:54,581
Of course. If I was married...

1126
01:31:54,822 --> 01:32:00,021
...and came in on my husband making
toast for a blond, I'd shoot him.

1127
01:32:00,382 --> 01:32:03,021
- You would?
- Bang, bang, bang!

1128
01:32:03,262 --> 01:32:05,014
Right in the head.

1129
01:32:05,982 --> 01:32:07,938
Come on now, relax.

1130
01:32:08,182 --> 01:32:11,970
- You're just making this all up.
- That's right.

1131
01:32:12,222 --> 01:32:16,295
I don't suppose if she had come in
she'd shoot me.

1132
01:32:16,542 --> 01:32:20,057
She'd be mad, maybe throw an ashtray.

1133
01:32:20,302 --> 01:32:23,533
- Just that?
- She probably wouldn't even do that.

1134
01:32:23,782 --> 01:32:26,057
If she found you in the shower...

1135
01:32:26,302 --> 01:32:29,180
...she'd probably think
you were the plumber.

1136
01:32:30,142 --> 01:32:34,181
- A blond plumber?
- Absolutely. She trusts me implicitly.

1137
01:32:34,422 --> 01:32:37,619
- Doesn't she love you?
- Oh, she loves me.

1138
01:32:37,862 --> 01:32:39,261
She worries about me.

1139
01:32:39,502 --> 01:32:43,461
I had a cough,
and she made me stop smoking.

1140
01:32:43,662 --> 01:32:46,460
- She loves me, all right.
- Isn't she jealous?

1141
01:32:46,662 --> 01:32:52,692
Not really. How can anybody be jealous
of somebody with a briefcase...

1142
01:32:52,902 --> 01:32:57,498
...who's getting a little pot
and can't keep his eyes open past 9?

1143
01:32:57,742 --> 01:33:00,973
She trusts me.
It'd never occur to her that I...

1144
01:33:01,222 --> 01:33:05,101
Last Christmas, I came home
with lipstick on my collar.

1145
01:33:05,342 --> 01:33:09,733
Helen said, "What's that
on your collar, cranberry sauce?"

1146
01:33:11,102 --> 01:33:15,653
- That's bad.
- You know who kissed me? Mrs. Brady.

1147
01:33:15,902 --> 01:33:19,941
Face it, no pretty girl wants me,
she wants Gregory Peck.

1148
01:33:20,182 --> 01:33:23,857
Is that so? How do you know
what a pretty girl wants?

1149
01:33:24,102 --> 01:33:26,138
I don't know, but I imagine...

1150
01:33:26,382 --> 01:33:30,057
Your imagination!
You think every girl's a dope.

1151
01:33:30,302 --> 01:33:34,295
You think a girl goes to a party
and there's some guy...

1152
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:38,057
...in a fancy striped vest
strutting around...

1153
01:33:38,302 --> 01:33:42,773
...giving you that I'm-so-handsome-
you-can't-resist-me look.

1154
01:33:43,022 --> 01:33:46,298
From this she's supposed
to fall flat on her face.

1155
01:33:46,542 --> 01:33:49,295
Well, she doesn't fall on her face.

1156
01:33:50,422 --> 01:33:54,540
But there's another guy in the room,
over in the corner.

1157
01:33:54,782 --> 01:33:58,331
Maybe he's nervous and shy
and perspiring a little.

1158
01:33:58,582 --> 01:34:00,493
First, you look past him.

1159
01:34:00,742 --> 01:34:05,338
But then you sense that
he's gentle and kind and worried.

1160
01:34:05,582 --> 01:34:10,178
That he'll be tender with you,
nice and sweet.

1161
01:34:10,542 --> 01:34:13,295
That's what's really exciting.

1162
01:34:16,462 --> 01:34:20,501
If I were your wife,
I'd be very jealous of you.

1163
01:34:21,102 --> 01:34:24,094
I'd be very, very jealous.

1164
01:34:29,862 --> 01:34:32,330
I think you're just elegant.

1165
01:34:34,382 --> 01:34:35,895
Thank you.

1166
01:34:37,302 --> 01:34:38,940
Aren't you going to answer it?

1167
01:34:39,182 --> 01:34:41,901
- Answer what?
- The doorbell.

1168
01:34:42,942 --> 01:34:46,093
Go ahead, I'll put the cinnamon
on the toast.

1169
01:34:58,942 --> 01:35:01,331
Tom MacKenzie!

1170
01:35:01,622 --> 01:35:04,614
- Morning, Dickie-boy.
- What are you doing here?

1171
01:35:04,862 --> 01:35:08,650
- Don't call me "Dickie-boy. "
- Got a date with my agent.

1172
01:35:08,902 --> 01:35:11,052
- Is that coffee I smell?
- No.

1173
01:35:11,302 --> 01:35:16,137
I'm glad I caught you. We've got
important family business to discuss.

1174
01:35:16,382 --> 01:35:20,011
- Are you sure that's not coffee?
- Positive. My family?

1175
01:35:20,262 --> 01:35:24,619
I was driving down and Helen
asked me to stop by and ask you...

1176
01:35:24,862 --> 01:35:27,854
She did? I'm glad she did...

1177
01:35:28,102 --> 01:35:30,252
...because I wanna talk to you.

1178
01:35:30,502 --> 01:35:33,335
What's the matter, Dickie-boy?

1179
01:35:33,582 --> 01:35:37,973
You think you're pretty fancy
with the blinkers on the horses.

1180
01:35:38,222 --> 01:35:40,531
What blinkers? What horses?

1181
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:43,979
And no driver and no other people.

1182
01:35:44,222 --> 01:35:47,373
- You drunk or something?
- No, I'm not drunk.

1183
01:35:47,622 --> 01:35:51,979
- You took Helen on a hayride.
- No, in fact, I didn't.

1184
01:35:52,222 --> 01:35:55,931
She went with the other people.
And it was like a bus.

1185
01:35:56,182 --> 01:35:59,652
- That's your story.
- I have terrible hay fever.

1186
01:35:59,902 --> 01:36:02,416
I've had it ever since the Army.

1187
01:36:02,662 --> 01:36:07,213
This doctor took a wad of cotton.
He went in and down...

1188
01:36:07,462 --> 01:36:11,853
In and down. "Inwardly,
downwardly pulsating!

1189
01:36:12,102 --> 01:36:17,176
Now together, ending and unending!
Now, now!" I know all about it.

1190
01:36:17,422 --> 01:36:19,014
- You're drunk.
- Get out!

1191
01:36:19,262 --> 01:36:22,413
- If Helen sent you to get a divorce...
- Divorce?

1192
01:36:22,662 --> 01:36:24,892
I absolutely refuse!

1193
01:36:25,142 --> 01:36:29,215
- She sent me for the paddle.
- I'll fight it in every court!

1194
01:36:29,462 --> 01:36:33,341
I can explain the stairs,
the blond in the kitchen.

1195
01:36:33,582 --> 01:36:38,497
- Wait, what blond in the kitchen?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1196
01:36:38,742 --> 01:36:40,892
Maybe it's Marilyn Monroe!

1197
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:44,932
Blind, stinking drunk
at 8:30 in the morning!

1198
01:36:45,182 --> 01:36:49,494
I'll get six lawyers,
I'll bribe judges, but no divorce!

1199
01:36:49,742 --> 01:36:53,212
Listen to me.
Helen does not want a divorce!

1200
01:36:53,462 --> 01:36:57,057
All she wants is Ricky's paddle!

1201
01:36:58,342 --> 01:37:02,096
- Ricky's paddle?
- The other kids are out on the lake.

1202
01:37:02,342 --> 01:37:07,097
But Ricky has to stay on the dock.
You wouldn't send his paddle!

1203
01:37:07,342 --> 01:37:11,699
If anybody is gonna take
Ricky's paddle back...

1204
01:37:11,942 --> 01:37:13,660
...I'm gonna take it back.

1205
01:37:13,902 --> 01:37:16,780
And I've got a good mind
to punch you.

1206
01:37:17,022 --> 01:37:20,059
- Why?
- Because you're a big lunk.

1207
01:37:20,302 --> 01:37:24,659
Strutting around in your vest
with that I'm-so-handsome look.

1208
01:37:24,902 --> 01:37:29,180
- Let me tell you, Helen loves me.
- Sure, she loves you!

1209
01:37:29,422 --> 01:37:33,779
She loves me because I'm sweet
and gentle and worried...

1210
01:37:34,022 --> 01:37:37,059
...and nervous and shy and tender!

1211
01:37:45,742 --> 01:37:47,334
Breakfast is ready.

1212
01:37:49,702 --> 01:37:52,774
- Anybody you know?
- Meet Tom MacKenzie.

1213
01:37:53,022 --> 01:37:56,219
- How do you do?
- He came for Ricky's paddle.

1214
01:37:56,462 --> 01:38:00,819
- I'm taking it to him.
- Is this a good time to pick up the...?

1215
01:38:01,062 --> 01:38:04,372
- I wish I was dead.
- Wait a minute, Kruhulik.

1216
01:38:04,622 --> 01:38:08,058
If you wanna pick up something,
pick up this.

1217
01:38:08,302 --> 01:38:11,021
What do you want me to do with him?

1218
01:38:11,262 --> 01:38:15,938
I don't care. Put him in mothballs.
Just get him out of here.

1219
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:19,413
Boy, I'm telling you,
lug the fat poodle...

1220
01:38:19,662 --> 01:38:22,699
...lug the tomato plant, now lug this.

1221
01:38:22,942 --> 01:38:27,299
I'll be glad when the wives get home
and things settle down.

1222
01:38:28,542 --> 01:38:31,932
The 8:47, I can still make the 8:47.

1223
01:38:32,182 --> 01:38:34,537
I can't stay for breakfast, I'm sorry.

1224
01:38:34,782 --> 01:38:36,659
Don't ever be sorry.

1225
01:38:36,902 --> 01:38:39,541
Do me a favor. Call Brady & Company.

1226
01:38:39,782 --> 01:38:45,175
Tell Mr. Brady I'm taking two weeks
off, whether he likes it or not.

1227
01:38:46,502 --> 01:38:49,938
Why don't you stay here?
You've got your own duplex.

1228
01:38:50,182 --> 01:38:53,219
Big, tall martinis, air conditioning.

1229
01:38:53,462 --> 01:38:57,501
- Thank you.
- Well, I guess that's all.

1230
01:38:58,102 --> 01:39:00,093
- Just one more thing.
- What?

1231
01:39:00,302 --> 01:39:03,021
I have a message for your wife.

1232
01:39:10,902 --> 01:39:12,620
Don't wipe it off.

1233
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:14,938
If she thinks it's cranberries...

1234
01:39:15,142 --> 01:39:18,578
...tell her she's got cherry pits
in her head.

1235
01:39:20,462 --> 01:39:21,690
Wait!

1236
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:29,695
Hey!
