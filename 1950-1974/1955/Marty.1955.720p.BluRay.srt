1
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:42,337
- Hello, Sam.
- Hiya, Marty.

2
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:49,443
Your kid brother got married
Sunday, huh, Marty?

3
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:52,279
That's right, Mrs Fusari.
It was a very nice affair.

4
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,492
- The tall fella with the moustache?
- No. No, that's my other brother Freddie.

5
00:01:56,493 --> 00:02:00,371
Freddie got married about four years
ago. He lives on Webb Avenue.

6
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:02,957
No, the one who got
married Sunday is Nicky.

7
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,627
I thought he was a big, fat fella.
Don't I meet him here one time?

8
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:09,296
A big, tall, fat fella,
tried to sell me insurance.

9
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,508
Oh, no, that's my sister
Margaret's husband Frank.

10
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:15,094
Margaret married the
insurance salesman.

11
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:17,555
And my sister Rose
married the contractor.

12
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:19,598
They moved to Detroit last year.

13
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,601
My other sister Frances, she
got married two years ago

14
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:25,062
in St John's Church on
Kingsbridge Avenue.

15
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:27,716
Oh, that was a very nice affair.

16
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:33,529
Well, let's see now. That'll be $1.79.
How's that with you, Mrs Fusari?

17
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,573
Well...

18
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:38,951
- Hey, Marty, I'm in a hurry!
- You're next right now, Mrs Canduso.

19
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:42,788
When you gonna get married, Marty?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

20
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:47,585
All your brothers and sisters younger than
you. They get married, they got children.

21
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:53,382
I meet your mother. She say to me "Hey,
you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?"

22
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:57,053
What's the matter with you? That's
no way. What's the matter with you?

23
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:59,513
- Mrs Fusari...
- You get married, you hear?

24
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:03,601
- Mrs Fusari, Mrs Canduso's in a...
- My boy Frank was 19 when he married.

25
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:05,686
- What's the matter?
- That's swell.

26
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:08,606
You should be ashamed of yourself!

27
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:12,485
- Marty, I want a pullet, about four pounds.
- Sure.

28
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:17,239
- I hear your kid brother got married.
- That's right. It was a very nice affair.

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,159
Marty, you oughta be
ashamed of yourself.

30
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,537
All your kid brothers and sisters
married and got children.

31
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,399
When are you gonna get married?

32
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:40,830
The Giants are gonna wind up
in the cellar! In the cellar!

33
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:44,751
Hey, Lou, turn on the Dodger game.

34
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,689
- What happened?
- Yanks won both. They murdered 'em!

35
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,550
Any homers? Whoo!

36
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:58,155
So anyway, Leo and me, we're sittin'
in the bar and these two girls come in.

37
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,825
- Angie come in yet?
- So they come to the bar...

38
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:03,619
- Hey, Ange, you want a beer?
- Yeah, I guess so.

39
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,123
- So I look over at the one next to me...
- Hey, Lou.

40
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:08,749
- Hiya, Marty.
- Hiya, Ralph.

41
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,461
I'm tellin' these guys about two nurses
Leo and me picked up in a joint.

42
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:16,590
- Hey, Lou, let me have two beers.
- So let me tell ya about these two nurses.

43
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,676
- Man, oh, man!
- How about that, huh?

44
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:21,262
- What you readin', Joe?
- Lou, turn the set off!

45
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:26,225
- They shouldn't sell magazines like this.
- Imagine the effect it has on adolescents.

46
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:28,185
Now, that's something, huh?

47
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:31,230
- I went out with a girl like that.
- You should live so long!

48
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,025
Hey, Richie, the Yankees
took two today.

49
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,776
Hey, Marty.

50
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:40,489
Hey, Marty, Leo and me, we got a date
with these two nurses tonight, you know?

51
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,826
So we gotta take 'em somewheres
first, you know what I mean?

52
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:48,164
So I'm hard up for cash
right now and I...

53
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:50,859
I owe you ten bucks
already, don't I?

54
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:53,544
I'll find it somewhere else.

55
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:55,629
Hey. Hey, Richie.

56
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,325
That Ralph, boy, he's always
got girls but no money.

57
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,270
- See ya, Ralph.
- See ya, Joe.

58
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:14,132
So, what do you feel
like doin' tonight?

59
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:18,720
I don't know, Ange.
What do you feel like doin'?

60
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:22,823
Well, we oughta do somethin'.
It's Saturday night.

61
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:26,061
I don't wanna go bowlin'
like last Saturday.

62
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:32,708
Hey, how about callin' up that big girl
we picked up in the movies a month ago

63
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,294
up in the RKO Chester?

64
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:38,631
- Which one was that?
- That big girl that was in front of us

65
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:42,051
- with the skinny friend.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

66
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:46,597
Her name was Mary Feeney. We took
'em home all the way out in Brooklyn.

67
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:50,476
What do you say? Think we oughta
give 'em a call? I'll take the skinny one.

68
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:54,397
- She maybe got a date already, Ange.
- What can we lose?

69
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:58,301
I didn't like her. I don't
feel like callin' her up.

70
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:01,404
Well, what do you feel
like doin' tonight?

71
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:04,991
I don't know, Ange.
What do you feel like doin'?

72
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:09,412
We're back to that, huh? I say "What
do you feel like doin' tonight?"

73
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:12,498
You say back to me "I don't know.
What do you feel like doin'?"

74
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:17,654
Then we wind up sittin' around your
house with a couple of cans of beer.

75
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:21,825
I'll tell you what
I feel like doin'.

76
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:25,537
I feel like callin' up
this here Mary Feeney.

77
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,639
She likes you.

78
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,725
What makes you say that?

79
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:33,978
- Man, I could see she likes ya.
- Yeah, sure.

80
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:38,007
- Call her up.
- You call her up yourself. I don't want to.

81
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:43,555
Well, how about goin'
down 72nd Street?

82
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:47,559
See what we can find down there?

83
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,456
Ralph says you gotta beat 'em off with
clubs. Boy, you're gettin' to be a real drag!

84
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,125
I been lookin' for a girl
every Saturday night.

85
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:58,794
I'm 34. I'm just tired
of lookin', that's all!

86
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:02,506
I'd like to find a girl!
Everybody's tellin' me "Get married."

87
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:07,136
Don't you think I wanna get married?
I want to. Everybody drives me crazy.

88
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:12,433
I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night.
You go somewhere. I don't wanna go.

89
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:16,771
Boy, my old lady, too. Every word out of
her mouth: "When you gettin' married?"

90
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:19,883
My mother, boy,
she drives me crazy.

91
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,435
So...

92
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:34,814
what do you feel
like doin' tonight?

93
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,985
I don't know, Ange.

94
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:44,032
- What do you feel like doin'?
- Hello. Yeah, he's here.

95
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:47,134
- Marty, your mother's on the phone.
- My mother?

96
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:49,679
He's comin' now, Mrs Piletti.

97
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,975
- Hey, Marty. I'm goin' home.
- Listen, Ange, come on over about 7.30.

98
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:57,979
We'll think of somethin'.
Hello, Ma. What's the matter?

99
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,985
Your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia,
they're here and waitin' to see you.

100
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:06,320
OK, Ma. I'll be home
in two minutes.

101
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:09,849
Listen, Ma, tell Thomas to
stick around. I wanna see him.

102
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,937
OK. You come on home, huh? OK.

103
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:19,166
Marty's coming home.

104
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:23,546
So what happened about this milk bottle
was, my mother-in-law is in the kitchen,

105
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:27,091
she begins pokin' her head over
my shoulder here and there.

106
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:32,263
Then she tells me how I waste money, I
can't cook and I'm raisin' my baby wrong.

107
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:35,141
She got me so nervous I spilled
the milk for the baby.

108
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:37,435
Tommy, your mother
is my sister, but...

109
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:42,565
So she says "You're spillin' the milk."
She kept talkin' about these drops of milk.

110
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:47,403
Finally she got me so mad I said "Mama,
you wanna see me really spill milk?"

111
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:50,156
So I picked up the bottle
and I threw it at the door.

112
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:53,200
I didn't throw it at her.
That's something she made up.

113
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,995
She tells everybody I threw
a bottle of milk at her.

114
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:58,414
I didn't throw it
anywheres near her.

115
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:01,709
Anyway, I was sorry, but she
ran out of the house and I...

116
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,699
I don't know what you want me to do, but,
if you want me to, I come and talk to her.

117
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:10,801
- Well, Aunt Theresa, we...
- Let me tell it, Tommy.

118
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:12,845
OK.

119
00:09:12,846 --> 00:09:16,474
Aunt Theresa, we want you to
do a very big favour for us.

120
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:17,808
Sure.

121
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,144
Aunt Theresa, you got
this big house here.

122
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:22,980
You got this big house
just for you and Marty.

123
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:26,400
I thought Tommy's mother could
come and live with you and Marty.

124
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,527
- Well...
- I talked to Tommy's brother

125
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:34,033
and I said "You gotta take her for a
couple of years!" And he says "Oh, no!"

126
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:37,536
- I sound terrible...
- No, Virginia. I know how you feel.

127
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:42,041
I just can't stand it any more! Every
minute of the day! Do this! Do that!

128
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:46,170
I don't have ten minutes privacy with my
husband. We can't even have a fight.

129
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,339
We don't have any privacy!

130
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,218
- All right, Ginnie. Don't get so excited.
- She's right, Tommy.

131
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:55,346
A young husband and wife
should have their own home.

132
00:09:55,347 --> 00:10:01,227
And my sister Caterina, well... she's my
sister, but I must say she's an old goat.

133
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:05,773
And plenty of time in my life I feel like
throw the milk bottle at her myself.

134
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:11,862
But I tell you right now, if Caterina wants
to come and live here with Marty and me,

135
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:14,516
it's all right with me.

136
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:17,493
That's very nice of
you, Aunt Theresa.

137
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:20,705
- Of course, we gotta ask Marty first.
- Sure, sure.

138
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:24,500
Sit here. I go in the kitchen and
turn a little fire under the cooking.

139
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:27,278
That's very nice of
you, Aunt Theresa.

140
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:36,929
How's Marty been
lately, Aunt Theresa?

141
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,101
Oh, he's fine. You know a
nice girl he can marry?

142
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:44,395
Oh, don't worry. He'll get married.

143
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:48,717
I don't know. He sits around
the house all the time.

144
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:52,846
You know a nice place where
he can go to get a bride?

145
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:57,742
There's the Stardust Ballroom.
That's a big dance hall.

146
00:10:57,743 --> 00:11:01,370
Every Saturday night it's loaded
with girls. It's a nice place.

147
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:05,791
You pay 77 cents. Well, it used to be 77
cents. Probably a dollar and a half now.

148
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,085
You go in and ask
some girl to dance.

149
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,921
It's a respectable...
That's where I met Virginia.

150
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:15,551
You tell Marty to go to the Stardust
Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.

151
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:19,639
"The Stardust Ballroom.
It's loaded with tomatoes."

152
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,473
Right.

153
00:11:20,474 --> 00:11:24,961
Aunt Theresa, this is so nice of you.
I want you to know we appreciate it.

154
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:29,090
He's here.

155
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,513
- Hello, Marty.
- Hello, Ma.

156
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:38,324
Thomas and Virginia are here.

157
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:41,702
They just had another big fight
with your Aunt Caterina,

158
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:44,622
so they ask me if it's OK
Caterina come live here.

159
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:48,125
I said all right with me,
but we gotta ask you.

160
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:51,837
Marty, she's a lonely old woman.
Nobody wants her.

161
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:55,383
Everybody's throwing
her out they house.

162
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:59,662
- Well, sure, Ma. It's OK with me.
- You got a good heart.

163
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,894
- Marty say it's all right she come here.
- Thanks. Takes a load off of my mind.

164
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:10,564
- We got plenty of room here.
- Oh, it's gonna be nice.

165
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:14,944
I come over tonight, I talk to Caterina.
Everything is gonna work out all right.

166
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:17,947
I wanna thank you because
it was becoming impossible.

167
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,907
Sit down, Thomas. Sit down.

168
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:23,744
Marty, I appreciate what you and
your mother are doing because...

169
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:26,539
- Oh.
- No, listen. What was happening...

170
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,208
Virginia was makin'
milk and my mother...

171
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,919
- I promised the baby-sitter six o'clock.
- OK.

172
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,881
- Before you go, I need some advice.
- Sure. What?

173
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:40,970
Well, you're the accountant in the family.
My boss wants to sell his shop to me.

174
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:44,056
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, him and his wife live alone.

175
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:48,936
They wanna move out to California
and live near their married daughter.

176
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:52,857
Well, he wants $5,000 down, although
I think I can knock him down to four.

177
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,318
Tommy!

178
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:58,738
Marty, I gotta run now, but
I'll meet you at mass tomorrow.

179
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:02,366
Afterwards we'll discuss it. It
sounds like a good proposition.

180
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:05,812
- OK. He wants an answer by Monday.
- Oh, sure.

181
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:10,708
We'll work out an arrangement about
my mother. I wanna pay you...

182
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,668
- No, listen...
- Tommy!

183
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:15,630
We'll talk about it later.
Thanks again.

184
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:18,549
- Goodbye, Marty.
- Goodbye, Virginia. See ya soon.

185
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,663
- Goodbye, Aunt Theresa.
- Goodbye, Aunt Theresa. Thank you.

186
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,619
Hello. Is this Mary Feeney?

187
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,664
Well, could I speak
to Miss Mary Feeney?

188
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:34,526
Just tell her an old friend.

189
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:43,426
Oh, hello there.
Is this Mary Feeney?

190
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:47,956
Hello there. This is Marty Piletti.
I wonder if you recall me.

191
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:53,352
Well, I'm kind of a stocky guy. The last
time we met was in the RKO Chester.

192
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:57,189
You was with a friend of yours and I was
with a friend of mine name of Angie.

193
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,843
This was about a month ago.

194
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:03,972
The RKO Chester on
West Farms Square.

195
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:09,952
Yeah, you was sittin' in front of us and
we was annoyin' ya and you got mad.

196
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:13,148
I'm the fella who works
in a butcher shop.

197
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:16,860
Oh, come on, you know who I am.

198
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:22,757
That's right! And then we went to Howard
Johnson's. You had a milk shake.

199
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:27,412
Yeah, that's right. I'm the
stocky one, the heavyset fella.

200
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:33,934
Yeah. Well, I'm glad you recall me, because
I had a pretty nice time that night

201
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:37,422
and I was wonderin' how
everything was with you.

202
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:41,676
How's everything?

203
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:45,404
That's swell.

204
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:50,660
Yeah, well, I'll tell you why I called.
I was figurin' on takin' in a movie tonight

205
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:54,872
and I was wonderin' if you and your
friend would care to see a movie tonight

206
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:57,317
with me and my friend.

207
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,653
Yeah, tonight.

208
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,910
I know it's a little late to call for a
date, but I didn't know myself till...

209
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,873
Yeah, I know.

210
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:14,751
Yeah, well, what about...

211
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:19,881
Well, how about next Saturday night?
Are you free next Saturday night?

212
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:25,762
Well, what about the
Saturday after that?

213
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,767
Yeah.

214
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:33,828
Yeah, I know.

215
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:36,272
Oh, I mean, I understand that...

216
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,402
Yeah.

217
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,906
Yeah.

218
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:21,584
So, what are you gonna
do tonight, Marty?

219
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:25,504
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out.
I may just hang around the house.

220
00:17:25,505 --> 00:17:28,341
Why don't you go to the
Stardust Ballroom?

221
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:29,675
What?

222
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:35,306
I say "Why don't you go to the Stardust
Ballroom?" It's loaded with tomatoes.

223
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:38,184
- It's loaded with what?
- Tomatoes.

224
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:41,479
Who told you about the
Stardust Ballroom, Ma?

225
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,733
- Tommy. He say it's very nice place.
- Oh, Thomas!

226
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:49,737
Ma, it's just a big dance hall, that's all.
I been there a hundred times.

227
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:52,490
Loaded with tomatoes!
Boy, you're funny, Ma.

228
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:55,826
Marty, I don't want you hanging
around the house tonight.

229
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:59,455
- I want you go shave and go dance.
- Ma, when are you gonna give up?

230
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:03,417
- You got a bachelor on your hands.
- You gonna get married.

231
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:07,880
Ma, sooner or later there comes a point in
a man's life when he's gotta face facts.

232
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:11,509
One fact I gotta face is whatever
it is women like, I ain't got it.

233
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,887
I chased after enough girls in my life.
I went to enough dances.

234
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:17,515
I got hurt enough. I don't
wanna get hurt no more.

235
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:21,060
I just called up a girl this afternoon.
I got a real brushoff, boy.

236
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:24,105
I figured I was past the point
of bein' hurt, but that hurt.

237
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:28,067
Some stupid woman who I didn't even
wanna call up. She gave me the brush.

238
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:30,319
I don't wanna go to the
Stardust Ballroom.

239
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,573
All that ever happened to me there was
girls made me feel like I was a bug.

240
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:38,202
I got feelings, you know. I had
enough pain. No, thanks, Ma.

241
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:40,037
- Marty...
- No.

242
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:42,248
I'm gonna stay home tonight.

243
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:45,126
- You gonna die without a son.
- So I'll die without a son.

244
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:48,879
- Marty, put on the blue suit, huh?
- Blue suit, grey suit.

245
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,341
I'm just a fat, little man.
A fat, ugly man.

246
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:55,177
- You not ugly.
- I'm ugly! I'm ugly! I'm ugly!

247
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:58,039
- Marty.
- Ma! Leave me alone!

248
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,978
Ma, what do you want from me?
I'm miserable enough as it is.

249
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:07,898
All right, I'll go to the Stardust Ballroom.
I'll put on a blue suit and go.

250
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:13,263
You know what I'm gonna get for my
trouble? Heartache. A night of heartache!

251
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:30,755
Loaded with tomatoes!

252
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:33,283
That's rich.

253
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:04,606
- Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
- Yeah.

254
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,085
There was a nice-lookin' one over
there with the black dress on.

255
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:11,738
But she's dancin' now.

256
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:16,342
Hey, there's a nice-lookin', little
short one for you down there.

257
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:19,871
- Where?
- Down there. That little one down there.

258
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:25,142
Oh, yeah.

259
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:27,812
What do you say? Wanna ask 'em?

260
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:31,299
I'll take the one with the
flowers on her dress.

261
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:35,778
Well, I think this
music's a little fast.

262
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:38,223
Just a minute.

263
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:46,231
Yeah, I think it's all right.
Are they still over there?

264
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:12,841
What do you say? You wanna dance?

265
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:20,948
Uh, excuse me. Would
you care to dance?

266
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:24,853
- I don't feel like dancin' just yet.
- Sure.

267
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:58,736
Clara, have you decided
about tomorrow?

268
00:21:58,737 --> 00:22:02,031
Millie, I always go to the
movies with Papa on Sunday.

269
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:06,978
- I know, but you could have a lot of fun.
- I'm gonna get some cigarettes.

270
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:15,211
Herb, I told you she wasn't especially
attractive, but she had a lot of charm.

271
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,505
Look, Herb, she's a real nice kid.

272
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:21,926
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get
one Saturday night off every three weeks.

273
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:24,095
I was expecting somethin' better.

274
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:28,208
- D'you like him, Clara?
- Yes. He seems very nice.

275
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:32,812
- Millie's been after me to fix her up.
- All right, I'm having a fair time.

276
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:37,733
I get one Saturday night off in three weeks
and I wanted to wind up with something.

277
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:40,178
- OK. So I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

278
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:12,101
- Herbie, have you ever been here before?
- Hey!

279
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:14,061
Herbie!

280
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:18,149
- What are you doing here?
- I came up to dance. What do you think?

281
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,736
- You here with somebody?
- I'm just here with another girl.

282
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:26,240
- Where you goin' now?
- For some cigarettes. Left 'em in my coat.

283
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:29,519
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah, I'll see ya.

284
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:36,609
Oh, that's a...
girl I used to know.

285
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:52,642
- Boy, it's sure packed in here.
- Some of these kids are awfully young.

286
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:55,061
You might run into one
of your students.

287
00:23:55,062 --> 00:23:57,647
I wouldn't think so.
I teach out in Brooklyn.

288
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:01,734
- Oh, you been here before, Clara?
- Yes. Twice.

289
00:24:01,735 --> 00:24:06,280
You wanna try and get a table and a
drink, or you just wanna start dancing?

290
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:10,618
Well, Herb... Herb! What do you say?
We grab a table before we dance?

291
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,705
Listen, you people go grab a
table. I'll be back in a minute.

292
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:17,150
I'll be right back.

293
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:21,696
What do you say, Clara, huh?
Come on, we'll grab a table.

294
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:56,288
- You here stag or with a girl?
- You say somethin'?

295
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:59,500
Yeah. I was askin' you if you
was here stag or with a girl.

296
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:04,255
- Oh, I'm stag.
- I got stuck on a blind date with a dog.

297
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,718
I just met an old girl I used to know,
so I need to get rid of the girl I'm with.

298
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:11,679
Somebody to take her home,
you know what I mean?

299
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,100
- I'd pay you $5 if you take her home.
- What?

300
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:20,104
I'll introduce you as an old army
buddy of mine and then I'll cut out,

301
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:25,443
because I got this other girl waiting for
me by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you $5.

302
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:28,555
- Are you kiddin'?
- No, I'm not kiddin'.

303
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:32,767
You just can't walk off
on a girl like that!

304
00:26:57,202 --> 00:27:00,371
As long as she's goin' home
alone, give me the $5 back.

305
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:03,525
Look, mac, you paid me the $5.
The $5 is mine.

306
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:01,833
Excuse me, miss, but
would you care to dance?

307
00:28:05,145 --> 00:28:07,380
Miss?

308
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:52,108
- You come up here often?
- I was up here twice before.

309
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:55,887
Once I came up with a friend
of mine and... once alone.

310
00:28:56,947 --> 00:28:59,391
The last time...

311
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:03,119
You see that girl sitting
over there in the grey dress?

312
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,370
Yeah.

313
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:08,483
Well, the last time I was
here, that's where I sat.

314
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:13,738
I sat there for an hour and a
half without moving a muscle.

315
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:20,245
Now and then some fellow would kind of
come up to me and then change his mind.

316
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:26,767
I'll never forget just sitting there for an
hour and a half with my hands in my lap.

317
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:30,004
Then I began to cry. I had
to get up and go home.

318
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:33,524
I've begun to cry a lot lately.

319
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:36,861
I cry a lot, too. I'm a big crier.

320
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:41,532
This is something recent with me, this
bursting into tears at the slightest thing.

321
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:44,327
I cry all the time,
any little thing.

322
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:49,332
My brothers, my brothers-in-law always
tell me what a good-hearted guy I am.

323
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,500
You're not good-hearted
by accident.

324
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:55,921
You get kicked around long enough,
you get to be a real professor of pain.

325
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:58,049
I know exactly how you feel.

326
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:03,262
I also want you to know I'm having a good
time with you and really enjoyin' myself.

327
00:30:03,263 --> 00:30:07,042
So, you see, you're not such
a dog as you think you are.

328
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:14,774
I'm having a very good time, too.

329
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:19,278
So there you are. So I guess I'm
not such a dog as I think I am.

330
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,739
No, you're a very nice guy.

331
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,493
I don't know why some girl
hasn't grabbed you off long ago.

332
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:29,330
Well, I don't know either.
I think I'm a very nice guy.

333
00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:33,668
I also think I'm a pretty smart
guy in my own way. Excuse me.

334
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:38,756
I figure two people get married and
they're gonna live together 40, 50 years,

335
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:42,969
so it's gotta be more than whether
they're just good-lookin' or not.

336
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,179
You think you're not
so good-lookin'.

337
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,225
Well, my father was a real ugly
man, but my mother adored him.

338
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:53,354
She told me how she'd get so miserable
sometimes, like everybody, you know?

339
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:57,566
And she says my father
always tried to understand.

340
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:02,530
I used to see them sometimes when I was
a kid sittin' in the livin' room talkin',

341
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:06,659
and I used to adore my old man,
because he was always so kind.

342
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,289
That's one of the most beautiful things I
have in my life - the way my parents were.

343
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,833
And my father was a real ugly man.

344
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:16,877
So it doesn't matter if
you look like a gorilla.

345
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:20,740
See, dogs like us, we ain't
such dogs as we think we are.

346
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:29,541
I'm 29 years old.

347
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:32,893
How old are you?

348
00:31:32,894 --> 00:31:35,755
I'm 34.

349
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,128
- Oh, hello, Aunt Theresa. Come on in.
- Is Caterina here?

350
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:02,131
We didn't say anything.
We thought we'd leave it to you.

351
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:06,552
We thought you'd put it like how you were
lonely and why doesn't she live with you.

352
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:12,475
That way it looks like she's doing you a
favour, instead of we're throwin' her out.

353
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:17,563
- You want Tommy and me to stay?
- No. It's better idea if you and Tommy go,

354
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:21,525
otherwise she's gonna start to fight
with you and everybody be yelling.

355
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:23,694
- Hello, Aunt Theresa.
- Hello, Thomas.

356
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:26,238
Who's there? Who's there?

357
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:29,742
- It's me, Caterina! How you feel?
- Hey, what are you doin' here?

358
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:31,827
I come to see you. How you feel?

359
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:35,247
I got a pain on my left side
and my leg throbs like a drum.

360
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:39,543
- I been getting pain in my shoulder.
- Hah! I got a pain in my shoulder, too.

361
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:44,715
I got a pain in my hip and my right
arm aches so much I can't sleep.

362
00:32:44,716 --> 00:32:47,176
Ah, it's a curse to be old.

363
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:51,263
We got a postcard from my
son Nicky and his bride.

364
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:55,043
They are in Florida in a big
hotel on their honeymoon.

365
00:32:55,227 --> 00:32:59,522
I got a letter from my
husband's cousin in Abruzzi.

366
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:02,066
- His mother die.
- Oh.

367
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:06,429
You remember Emilio DiGiorgio,
who own a tavern in Abruzzi?

368
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,864
- He die.
- Oh.

369
00:33:08,865 --> 00:33:12,868
- You know who else die?
- Who?

370
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:19,792
You know the old man who live upstairs
in this house? Irishman, always drunk.

371
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:25,532
He get pleurisy. He stay two weeks
in a hospital. Yesterday he die.

372
00:33:26,008 --> 00:33:32,138
I like to visit you, Caterina, because
you always got such cheerful news.

373
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:35,891
Hey, kids. Why don't you
two kids go to the movies?

374
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:38,311
Your mother and me,
we be baby-sitter.

375
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:42,189
- Let's go down to the Kaplans'.
- Sure, sure.

376
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:46,720
Ma, we'll be down at the Kaplans'
if you want us for anything. OK?

377
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:56,537
I wake up this morning. I hear
the baby cry, so I wake up.

378
00:33:56,538 --> 00:34:00,791
I come in their room, and that girl,
she's shakin' her hand at the baby.

379
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:05,921
I said "You brute! Don't you strike
that baby! That's my son's baby!"

380
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:08,507
- It's her baby, too.
- It's my son Thomas's baby.

381
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:10,259
But it's not your baby.

382
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,428
I tell you she throw a
bottle of milk at me?

383
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,472
I know. I know.

384
00:34:14,473 --> 00:34:17,558
She's a witch, that
one, I tell you.

385
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,935
- I tell you what she do yesterday?
- What she did?

386
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:22,396
- She give me the evil eye.
- Uffa, Caterina.

387
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:27,985
I keep one eye open when I sleep,
because she's gonna stab me in my bed.

388
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:32,615
Caterina, I want you to come
and live with me in my house.

389
00:34:32,616 --> 00:34:34,158
Hm?

390
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,229
Your son Thomas and his wife,
they come to my house today.

391
00:34:38,288 --> 00:34:41,248
They say things are no
good in this house.

392
00:34:41,249 --> 00:34:44,126
Caterina, your son is married.

393
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:47,880
Leave him in peace. He wants
to be alone with his wife.

394
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:50,675
They don't want no old woman
sittin' in the balcony.

395
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:54,679
My son Thomas come to
see you this afternoon,

396
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,433
and he say to you he's gonna throw
his mother from this house?

397
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:03,854
Ooh, Caterina, don't make
an opera out of this.

398
00:35:03,855 --> 00:35:07,400
The three of you and a little baby
in three skinny little rooms.

399
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:12,279
You know this is no good - old woman
living with a husband and wife.

400
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,157
Two women in the same
kitchen, the house burns up.

401
00:35:15,158 --> 00:35:18,953
So I'm an old garbage bag
put in the street, huh?

402
00:35:18,954 --> 00:35:22,232
Caterina, don't make a tragedy.

403
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:27,570
Come and live in my house where you
know you be more happier yourself.

404
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:32,283
It pains they should do this.

405
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:37,747
I know it pains.

406
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:41,559
These are the worst
years, I tell you.

407
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,255
Caterina, you are very dear to me.

408
00:35:45,772 --> 00:35:48,941
We cried lots of times together.

409
00:35:48,942 --> 00:35:54,196
When my poor husband, he die,
I would be crazy if not for you.

410
00:35:54,197 --> 00:35:59,577
I ask you to come to my house,
because I know I can make you happy.

411
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:02,230
Please come to my house, Caterina.

412
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:05,541
These are the worst
years, I tell you.

413
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:07,835
It's gonna happen to you.

414
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:10,004
I'm afraid to look in a mirror.

415
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:14,550
I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with
white hair, like the old ladies in the park -

416
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:18,929
little bundles in black shawl,
waiting for the coffin.

417
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,892
I'm 56 years old, and what
I got to do with myself?

418
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:27,104
I got strength in my hands.
I wanna clean, I wanna cook.

419
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:29,815
I wanna make dinner
for my children.

420
00:36:29,816 --> 00:36:34,570
Am I an old dog to lay near
the fire till my eyes close?

421
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:39,434
These are terrible years,
Theresa. Terrible years.

422
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,996
Caterina, listen...

423
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:47,984
It's gonna happen to you.
It's gonna happen to you!

424
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,254
What are you gonna do if
Marty gets married, huh?

425
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:54,423
What are you gonna cook?

426
00:36:54,424 --> 00:36:59,428
Where's all the children playin' in
all the rooms? Where's the noise?

427
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:03,541
It's a curse to be
a widow. A curse!

428
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:07,311
What are you gonna do
if Marty gets married?

429
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,964
What are you gonna do?

430
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:15,887
I'm gonna put my things in a bag,

431
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,724
and I come to you tomorrow.

432
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:33,004
Don't worry. We'll come right back.

433
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:34,922
You teach chemistry? What school?

434
00:37:34,923 --> 00:37:37,758
- Benjamin Franklin High School.
- In Brooklyn?

435
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:41,137
I went to Theodore Roosevelt on
Fordham Road. It's near my house.

436
00:37:41,138 --> 00:37:44,140
I have a cousin who's a teacher.
He teaches Latin.

437
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:46,976
He was studying to be a
priest, but he gave it up.

438
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:50,187
I was pretty good in high school.
I sound like a jerk now.

439
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:52,481
I got an 82 average.
That ain't bad.

440
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:56,652
I was accepted at City College, but
my old man died, so I had to go to work.

441
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:58,195
Want some cigarettes?

442
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:01,032
German was my best class.
That was my best language.

443
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:04,936
Der, die, das. Des, der, des.
There you are, I still remember.

444
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:08,831
You know what I was good
at in high school? Math.

445
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:12,418
You know how long ago I graduated
high school? June 1937.

446
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:17,548
Holy cow! June 1937! What is that?
15... 17 years ago!

447
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:21,761
Holy cow! Seven... Let's see,
is that right? Yeah, 17. That's right.

448
00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:27,308
Where'd it all go? I'm gettin' old. I'm
gonna be 35 years old November 8th. 35!

449
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:29,560
Wow! Time goes on, boy!

450
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:31,979
Yeah. 19... June 1937.

451
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,192
My old man died December 1937.
Two o'clock in the mornin', he died.

452
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:40,321
Bell rings. I knew somethin' was wrong
because my room is on the ground floor.

453
00:38:40,322 --> 00:38:43,950
I had to get outta bed to answer
the door, and there was Mr Stern.

454
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:47,870
He had a house down about a block
away from us. He moved out, though.

455
00:38:47,871 --> 00:38:51,832
My old man played cards with him and
some other guys. He was a Jewish fella.

456
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:56,921
So he said "Is your mother home?"
So I knew there was somethin' wrong.

457
00:38:56,922 --> 00:39:00,341
I was only 18, exactly 18 years
old just a month before.

458
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:04,136
So I said "Is something wrong,
Mr Stern?" I was in my pyjamas.

459
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:07,014
So he said "Marty,
your father died."

460
00:39:07,015 --> 00:39:10,559
My father died right in the middle
of playin' cards, at the table.

461
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,396
He had a heart attack.
He had low blood pressure.

462
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:16,148
He used to faint a lot, you know.

463
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:18,317
Boy... Boy, am I talkin'!

464
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:21,404
Excuse me. I never talked
so much in all my life.

465
00:39:21,405 --> 00:39:23,906
Usually everybody tells
me their troubles.

466
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:27,159
Well, I'm gonna shut up now
and let you get a word in.

467
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,870
Yeah, 17 years ago.

468
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:32,873
What I been doin' with
myself all that time?

469
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:36,127
Well, there I go again!
I must be drivin' you crazy.

470
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:39,422
Most of the time I'm with a girl
I... I can't find a word to say.

471
00:39:39,423 --> 00:39:43,342
I'm gonna shut up and let you get a word
in, because usually I'm not like this.

472
00:39:43,343 --> 00:39:45,303
Usually I...

473
00:39:45,304 --> 00:39:48,389
There I go again!
I can't stop talkin'.

474
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,642
I'm on a jag, for Pete's sakes!
You'd think I was loaded.

475
00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:54,937
Well, anyway, like...
like I started to say...

476
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:57,382
Ahi!

477
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:02,762
I can't stop my mouth.
Isn't this stupid?

478
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:06,449
You got a real nice face, you know.

479
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,893
Really, a nice face.

480
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:11,604
Thank you.

481
00:41:03,048 --> 00:41:06,951
- Hey, mac. Anything good inside?
- A bunch of dogs.

482
00:41:10,764 --> 00:41:13,208
Hey, Marty.

483
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:16,169
Marty, you in here?

484
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:45,089
So I'm in a kneeling position,

485
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,552
and if you ever tried shootin' a BAR in a
kneeling position, you know what I mean.

486
00:41:49,553 --> 00:41:53,790
I can't hold a steady position.
I'm waverin' back and forth.

487
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,893
So the guy next to me, he's
shootin' from a prone position,

488
00:41:57,894 --> 00:42:00,672
and he's cross-eyed,
like I told you.

489
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:06,319
So just then...

490
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,432
So just then I hear five shots
go off from the guy next to me.

491
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,355
My target goes down. A minute later the
flag comes up. I got five bull's-eyes!

492
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:25,905
That's how I got the reputation of being
the best shot in the whole battalion!

493
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:43,648
So when I got out of the
army, Clara, I was lost.

494
00:42:43,649 --> 00:42:46,567
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

495
00:42:46,568 --> 00:42:48,861
I was 25 years old.

496
00:42:48,862 --> 00:42:52,891
What was I gonna do? Go back to
my old job, 40 cents an hour?

497
00:42:53,617 --> 00:42:57,645
I thought maybe I'd go to college
under the GI Bill of Rights.

498
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:04,585
But my brother Freddie wanted to get
married and I had three unmarried sisters.

499
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:07,838
In an Italian house,
that's a terrible thing.

500
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,117
So I just went to pieces.

501
00:43:12,636 --> 00:43:17,290
I used to walk the streets till
three, four o'clock in the mornin'.

502
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:23,713
My poor mother... used to
be so worried about me.

503
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:32,055
God forgive me what I'm
gonna say now, but...

504
00:43:33,532 --> 00:43:36,726
I used to think of doin'
away with myself.

505
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:43,483
I used to stand on the subway and, God
forgive me what I'm gonna say, I...

506
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:47,378
I used to feel the tracks suckin'
me down under the wheels.

507
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:49,130
Yes, I know.

508
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:53,660
I'm Catholic, you know. Even to think
about suicide is a terrible sin.

509
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:56,371
Yes, I know.

510
00:43:58,098 --> 00:44:02,601
So then Mr Otari, he offered me
this job in his butcher shop and...

511
00:44:02,602 --> 00:44:05,479
Everybody pleaded
with me to take it.

512
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,924
So that's what happened.

513
00:44:08,442 --> 00:44:10,885
I didn't wanna be a butcher.

514
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:15,014
There's nothing wrong
with being a butcher.

515
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:19,327
Well, it's not an
elegant profession.

516
00:44:19,328 --> 00:44:23,414
It's in the lower social scale.
People look down on butchers.

517
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:25,859
I don't.

518
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:32,590
Well, the point is Mr Otari wants
to sell his shop now because...

519
00:44:32,591 --> 00:44:37,637
It's a nice little shop. I handle his books
for him, so I know he has a 35% mark-up,

520
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:40,498
which is not unreasonable.

521
00:44:41,391 --> 00:44:45,603
Takes home net maybe
$100, $150 a week.

522
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:49,023
Point is, of course, you gotta
worry about the supermarkets.

523
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:54,528
There's two in the neighbourhood and an
A&P comin' in, at least that's the rumour.

524
00:44:54,529 --> 00:44:59,934
Marty, it's my feeling that you
really want to buy this shop.

525
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:03,120
Well, that's true. I do.

526
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:07,500
But it means I gotta take a
loan out in a bank of $8,000.

527
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:09,944
That's a big note to carry.

528
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:18,411
Marty, I've known you for three hours,
but I know you're a good butcher.

529
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:23,391
You're an intelligent,
decent, sensitive man,

530
00:45:23,392 --> 00:45:28,020
and... well, I have a
feeling about you.

531
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:33,985
Like, well, like sometimes one of my
kids comes to see me about something,

532
00:45:33,986 --> 00:45:37,279
and some of these kids,
Marty, in my classes, they...

533
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,810
they have so much warmth
and so much capacity.

534
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:48,525
Well, that's the feeling
I have about you.

535
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:52,628
If you were one of my
students, I'd say to you

536
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:57,659
"Go ahead and buy the butcher shop.
You're a good butcher."

537
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:08,519
Well, there's lots of things
I could do with this shop.

538
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,147
I could organise my
own supermarket.

539
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:14,483
Get a bunch of neighbourhood
merchants together.

540
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:17,512
That's what a lot
of them are doin'.

541
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:21,490
What do you think?

542
00:46:21,491 --> 00:46:25,353
I think anything you
wanna do you'll do well.

543
00:46:26,913 --> 00:46:29,649
I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic?

544
00:46:32,502 --> 00:46:34,946
Yes, I am.

545
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:44,388
Look, I only got about $3 on me now, but
I only live about eight blocks from here.

546
00:46:44,389 --> 00:46:49,018
Why don't we go back to my house, I'll get
some dough and we can go somewhere?

547
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:50,853
I... I really should get home.

548
00:46:50,854 --> 00:46:54,174
It's only a quarter of 12.
The clock's right up there.

549
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:57,969
I... I really should get home.
I told my father...

550
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,350
Well, I... I suppose a
little while longer...

551
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:08,996
Do you suppose there's someplace around
here I could put on some makeup?

552
00:47:08,997 --> 00:47:12,625
Oh. Hey, mac! You got a
ladies' room around here?

553
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:15,070
- In the back.
- In the back.

554
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:25,281
- She told me, at the risk of her life.
- She always had thin hips.

555
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:30,077
She told me the doctor told her, if she had
more babies, it'd be at the risk of her life.

556
00:48:30,078 --> 00:48:32,830
When she told me that,
she already had six!

557
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:37,168
Every time I saw her, she was either
goin' to the hospital or comin' from it.

558
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:40,963
- She was hatchin' 'em out like eggs.
- Her husband's a skinny fella.

559
00:48:40,964 --> 00:48:45,593
Well, I bumped into her on the street
and she was as big as a barrel.

560
00:48:45,594 --> 00:48:47,970
- I said to her "Mary..."
- Lou, seen Marty?

561
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:51,432
- No, I ain't seen him all night.
- Where's everybody?

562
00:48:51,433 --> 00:48:54,310
"Didn't you say if you had
another it'd kill you?"

563
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:56,437
And her husband's a
little bit of a man.

564
00:48:56,438 --> 00:49:00,941
Well, last week on Tuesday she gave birth
to her baby in St Elizabeth's Hospital.

565
00:49:00,942 --> 00:49:05,947
- A fine, healthy boy. Nine pounds.
- That's fine. So the doctor was wrong.

566
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:08,699
Oh, no. She died right
there in the hospital.

567
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,187
Oh, that's a sad story.

568
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:16,207
- And her husband's that little fella?
- That's the one.

569
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,860
That's a sad story.

570
00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:46,362
..moving out to Port Chester.
It's silly to think of commuting.

571
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:51,534
I'd have to take the subway down to
125th, then take the bus to the railroad,

572
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:55,121
and then take the New York, New Haven
and Hartford out to Port Chester.

573
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:59,275
Then I think I have a 20-minute
bus ride out of Port Chester.

574
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:04,197
Somebody suggested that I buy a
car, but I'm terrified of cars.

575
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:07,409
I'm always afraid
I'll kill someone.

576
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:12,972
Of course, it is a fine
opportunity for me.

577
00:50:12,973 --> 00:50:17,059
I could never hope to be the head of a
department in the New York City system,

578
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,296
especially not in the
science courses.

579
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,900
Of course, I'm not sure I
want to be a department head.

580
00:50:24,901 --> 00:50:28,487
It's mostly executive and
administrative work.

581
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:30,932
On the other hand...

582
00:50:31,783 --> 00:50:35,911
Well, anyway I told
you about my father

583
00:50:35,912 --> 00:50:38,789
and, well, he depends
on me a great deal.

584
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:43,085
Well, let me tell ya, Clara.
I think you're kiddin' yourself.

585
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:45,921
I mean, I used to think about
leavin' home, you know.

586
00:50:45,922 --> 00:50:48,799
And that's what I used to
say: "My mother needs me."

587
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,970
But when you really come down
to it, that ain't it at all.

588
00:50:52,971 --> 00:50:57,683
We're just afraid to go out on our own. It's
a big step when you go out on your own.

589
00:50:57,684 --> 00:51:01,854
And I think you're kiddin' yourself
when you say your father needs you.

590
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:05,024
Actually, you need your father.
You know what I mean?

591
00:51:05,025 --> 00:51:07,193
Well, you know what I mean.

592
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:10,947
You're livin' at home now and you've
got your father and mother there.

593
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:14,158
You could go on like that,
be a little girl all your life.

594
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:16,619
I'm afraid of being lonely.

595
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,498
You won't be so lonely.
You'll make friends right away.

596
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:25,461
Well, actually, I don't
make friends easily.

597
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:28,673
What are you talkin' about?
You're a real likeable person.

598
00:51:28,674 --> 00:51:31,717
You'll make friends in Port
Chester one-two-three.

599
00:51:31,718 --> 00:51:35,012
You'll have people visitin'
you all the time. I'll visit you.

600
00:51:35,013 --> 00:51:40,059
I'll get my brother Freddie's car or
you can call me up when you feel blue.

601
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,478
Or I'll call you up and...

602
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:46,174
It'll be real nice.
Don't be so afraid.

603
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,783
Hey, Marty!

604
00:51:55,784 --> 00:51:59,437
Hey, Marty! Hey, over here!

605
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:03,525
- Hello, Ralph.
- Hey, Marty. Come over here a minute.

606
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:07,320
- Excuse me a minute.
- Sure.

607
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:12,174
- You'll like this guy. He's nice.
- Who? Marty?

608
00:52:12,175 --> 00:52:15,678
- Yeah.
- Oh, this guy's a nice guy, this guy.

609
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:18,306
- Hi, Ralph. Hello, Leo.
- Hiya, Marty.

610
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:20,558
Hey, Marty, come here a minute.

611
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,103
Hey, Marty, we got an odd
squirrel. You interested?

612
00:52:24,104 --> 00:52:26,314
What do you mean, Ralph?

613
00:52:26,315 --> 00:52:29,942
Hey, Louise, meet Marty Piletti.
Marty, that's Louise Kelly.

614
00:52:29,943 --> 00:52:33,946
- Hiya.
- We just gonna sit around here all night?

615
00:52:33,947 --> 00:52:38,200
Listen, Marty, these three
squirrels are nurses.

616
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:40,953
Money in the bank, man.

617
00:52:40,954 --> 00:52:44,832
All goin' over to Leo's house later
because there's nobody there.

618
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:47,527
These are the girls
I told you about.

619
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:51,964
Wanna get in the car?
She's a pretty nice-lookin' doll.

620
00:52:51,965 --> 00:52:57,303
- I'm with a girl, Ralph.
- Get rid of her. This is money in the bank.

621
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:01,974
I can't do that, because somebody
already brushed her off once tonight.

622
00:53:01,975 --> 00:53:04,836
This is a good deal here, Marty.

623
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:17,474
I can't do it, Ralph.
Thanks anyway, huh?

624
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:21,619
- Nice seein' you all.
- Come on, let's get outta here.

625
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,956
- Yeah. We might as well get goin'.
- I'll see ya, Leo.

626
00:53:24,957 --> 00:53:27,692
- So long, Ralph.
- So long, Marty.

627
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:09,359
Wait a minute. I'll find the light.

628
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:16,549
I guess my mother ain't home yet.

629
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:21,554
My cousin Thomas and Virginia must be at
the movies, so they won't be home yet.

630
00:54:21,555 --> 00:54:25,016
- This is the kitchen.
- Yes, I know.

631
00:54:25,017 --> 00:54:27,669
Come on in the dining room.

632
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:35,343
Sit down.

633
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:39,905
You want somethin' to eat?
We got chicken.

634
00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:42,491
No, thank you. I don't
think I should stay long.

635
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:45,979
Oh, sure. Well, just take
off your coat a minute.

636
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:04,055
I was tellin' you my brother Nicky got
married last Sunday. It was a nice affair.

637
00:55:04,056 --> 00:55:08,017
They had a statue of a woman and there
was whisky spoutin' out of her mouth.

638
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:12,647
I never saw anything so grand
in all my life. And what a meal!

639
00:55:12,648 --> 00:55:16,609
I'm a butcher, so I know a pretty
good hunk of meat when I see it.

640
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:20,513
This was choice fillet right off the
top of the chuck. $1.80 a pound.

641
00:55:20,656 --> 00:55:23,699
If you want a cheaper cut of
meat, why, get rib steak.

642
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,828
It's got a lot of waste on it, but it
comes to a buck and a quarter a pound,

643
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:30,273
if it's trimmed.

644
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:35,362
Listen, Clara... Make yourself
comfortable. You look all tense.

645
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:38,281
Oh, I'm fine.

646
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:43,078
You want me to take you
home, I'll take you home.

647
00:55:44,137 --> 00:55:46,998
Maybe it would be a good idea.

648
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:02,905
- No, Marty.
- I like you. I been tellin' you all night I do.

649
00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:04,657
- Marty...
- All I want is a kiss.

650
00:56:04,658 --> 00:56:06,325
- Please. Please.
- No, Marty.

651
00:56:06,326 --> 00:56:09,578
All right. All right.
I'll take you home!

652
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:11,414
All I wanted was a lousy kiss.

653
00:56:11,415 --> 00:56:16,361
Think I'd try somethin' serious with
my mother comin' home any minute?

654
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:21,700
I just didn't feel
like it, that's all.

655
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:47,892
Well...

656
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:52,397
I'm old enough to know better.

657
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:59,195
Come New Year's Eve, everybody
starts arrangin' parties.

658
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:03,700
I'm the guy they gotta
dig up a date for.

659
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:12,125
I'll just get a pack of
cigarettes and take...

660
00:57:19,941 --> 00:57:22,594
I'd like to see you again...

661
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:25,847
very much.

662
00:57:27,574 --> 00:57:32,286
The reason I didn't let you kiss me was
because I just didn't know how to...

663
00:57:32,287 --> 00:57:35,148
handle the situation.

664
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:40,653
You're the kindest man I ever met.

665
00:57:43,966 --> 00:57:48,469
The reason I tell you this is
because I want to see you again...

666
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,914
very much.

667
00:57:52,432 --> 00:57:58,838
I know when you take me home I'm going
to lie on my bed and think about you.

668
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:04,969
I want very much to see you again.

669
00:58:17,332 --> 00:58:20,360
What are you doin' tomorrow night?

670
00:58:22,754 --> 00:58:25,198
Nothing.

671
00:58:25,924 --> 00:58:28,785
I'll call you up tomorrow.

672
00:58:30,387 --> 00:58:33,055
Maybe we'll go see a movie.

673
00:58:33,056 --> 00:58:35,917
I'd like that very much.

674
00:58:39,813 --> 00:58:43,299
The reason I can't be
more definite now is...

675
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:48,738
because my Aunt Catherine's
probably comin' over tomorrow.

676
00:58:48,739 --> 00:58:51,182
I may have to help out.

677
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:55,270
I'll wait for your call.

678
00:59:05,631 --> 00:59:08,491
I better take you home now.

679
00:59:09,217 --> 00:59:12,720
It's gettin' late and the buses
only run about one an hour.

680
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:15,181
All right.

681
00:59:15,182 --> 00:59:17,792
I'll just get a pack of cigarettes.

682
00:59:51,385 --> 00:59:54,662
What are you doin' New Year's Eve?

683
00:59:55,889 --> 00:59:58,333
Nothing.

684
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:20,271
Hello! Hello! Marty?

685
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:28,504
- Hello, Marty. When you come home?
- We just got here ten minutes ago, Ma.

686
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:32,883
Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder.
She's a graduate of New York University.

687
01:00:32,884 --> 01:00:35,845
She teaches chemistry in
Benjamin Franklin High School.

688
01:00:35,846 --> 01:00:38,180
Sit down. Sit down.

689
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:41,017
You want some chicken?
We got chicken in the icebox.

690
01:00:41,018 --> 01:00:44,687
No, thank you, Mrs Piletti. We were
just going. Thank you anyway.

691
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:49,634
Well, sit down just a minute. I just
come in the house. I take off my coat.

692
01:00:50,694 --> 01:00:57,033
- Did Thomas give you a ride?
- Sure. Is a sad business.

693
01:00:57,034 --> 01:01:00,536
My sister Caterina, she no get
along with her daughter-in-law,

694
01:01:00,537 --> 01:01:02,913
so she gonna come live with us.

695
01:01:02,914 --> 01:01:07,168
- Oh, she's comin', huh, Ma?
- Sure. Sit down. Sit down.

696
01:01:07,169 --> 01:01:10,963
- Marty, tell her sit down.
- Might as well sit down a minute, Clara.

697
01:01:10,964 --> 01:01:15,384
- You offer young lady some fruit?
- I offered her, but she don't want nothin'.

698
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:17,553
No, thank you, really, Mrs Piletti.

699
01:01:17,554 --> 01:01:21,390
Is a very sad business, I tell you.

700
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:26,437
A woman, 56 years old, all her
life she had her own house.

701
01:01:26,438 --> 01:01:32,135
Now she's just an old woman sleeping
on her daughter-in-law couch.

702
01:01:32,152 --> 01:01:35,071
It's a curse to be a
mother, I tell you.

703
01:01:35,072 --> 01:01:40,076
Your children grow up and then
what is left for you to do?

704
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:43,579
What is a mother's
life but her children?

705
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:48,876
Is a very sad thing when your son
has no place for you in his house.

706
01:01:48,877 --> 01:01:52,630
Well, couldn't she find some kind
of hobby to fill out her time?

707
01:01:52,631 --> 01:01:57,093
Hobby. Hobby. What can she do?
She cook and she clean.

708
01:01:57,094 --> 01:02:02,207
But you gotta have a house to clean and
you gotta have children to cook for.

709
01:02:03,475 --> 01:02:08,797
These are the terrible years for
a mother. The terrible years.

710
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:12,316
You mustn't feel too harshly
against her daughter-in-law.

711
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:17,280
She probably also wants to have a house
to clean and children to cook for.

712
01:02:17,281 --> 01:02:24,161
You don't think my sister Caterina should
live in her daughter-in-law house?

713
01:02:24,162 --> 01:02:30,960
Well, I don't know them, but, as a rule, a
mother-in-law shouldn't live with a couple.

714
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:34,547
Where you think a
mother-in-law should go?

715
01:02:34,548 --> 01:02:39,885
I don't think a mother should depend so
much upon her children for her rewards.

716
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:45,933
Well, that's what they teach
you in... New York University.

717
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:49,228
In real life it no
work out like this.

718
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:51,605
You wait till you are a mother.

719
01:02:51,606 --> 01:02:56,636
It's silly of me to argue about it. I...
I don't know the people involved.

720
01:02:57,404 --> 01:03:02,199
Ma, I better take her home because the
buses only run about one an hour.

721
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,326
Sure.

722
01:03:03,327 --> 01:03:06,746
Good night. I'm glad to have met you.
I hope I see you again.

723
01:03:06,747 --> 01:03:09,665
OK, Ma. I'll be back in about
an hour, an hour and a half.

724
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:13,336
- Sure.
- Good night, Mrs Piletti.

725
01:03:13,337 --> 01:03:15,780
Good night.

726
01:03:23,263 --> 01:03:25,556
Hey!

727
01:03:25,557 --> 01:03:27,433
Hey!

728
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:29,393
Hey, Marty! Hey!

729
01:03:29,394 --> 01:03:31,838
Hey, Ange!

730
01:03:35,317 --> 01:03:38,736
Marty, where you been?
I been lookin' all over for ya.

731
01:03:38,737 --> 01:03:41,489
I looked all over for you,
but I couldn't find you.

732
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,658
Well, I was lookin'
all over for you.

733
01:03:43,659 --> 01:03:45,910
We thought we were
gonna go for a walk

734
01:03:45,911 --> 01:03:49,455
and then we thought we were gonna
come back, but we got to talkin'.

735
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:52,458
I want you to meet Clara.
Clara, my best friend Angie.

736
01:03:52,459 --> 01:03:55,002
- I told you about him.
- Yes. How do you do?

737
01:03:55,003 --> 01:03:57,030
Hello.

738
01:03:57,547 --> 01:04:02,551
- What we gonna do now?
- I'm taking Clara home. It's close to one.

739
01:04:02,552 --> 01:04:06,347
- You want me to ride down with ya?
- What for?

740
01:04:06,348 --> 01:04:10,142
- It's early.
- It must be one o'clock.

741
01:04:10,143 --> 01:04:13,463
It's Saturday night! There's
still plenty of action around!

742
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:17,733
Listen, by the time I get Clara
home it's gonna be 1.30.

743
01:04:17,734 --> 01:04:22,764
By the time I get home it'll be two. I gotta
get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.

744
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:28,995
- OK. I'll see ya.
- Hey, well, where you goin'? Hey, Ange.

745
01:04:28,996 --> 01:04:32,107
Hey, I'll see ya tomorrow
after mass, huh?

746
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:02,695
You got an elevator in this house?

747
01:05:02,696 --> 01:05:05,140
We only live one flight up.

748
01:05:05,657 --> 01:05:08,518
OK. So I'll see you tomorrow.

749
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:10,494
OK.

750
01:05:10,495 --> 01:05:15,082
Uh, I'll give you a call about 11,
11.30, as soon as I get out of mass.

751
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:21,297
Well, better make it around 2.30, because
I won't be home from my aunt's till then.

752
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:23,867
Oh, OK.

753
01:05:33,393 --> 01:05:36,129
OK. So... I'll see
you tomorrow night.

754
01:05:37,022 --> 01:05:39,049
OK.

755
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,303
- Good night.
- Good night.

756
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,299
Did you have a nice time?

757
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,200
Yes, I did. I had a very nice time.

758
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,000
Is mommy asleep?

759
01:06:50,663 --> 01:06:52,800
No, I'm not sleeping, dear.

760
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:55,099
So, you enjoyed yourself?

761
01:06:55,392 --> 01:06:57,115
Yes, I did.

762
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,096
I'll tell you about it in a minute.

763
01:07:00,097 --> 01:07:02,978
It seems like a very nice
man that young doctor.

764
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,828
Actually what happened is that...

765
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,712
that fellow that Millie brought up for
me met a girl he knew at the dancing

766
01:07:10,713 --> 01:07:13,172
And he left with her.
I mean...

767
01:07:13,858 --> 01:07:16,189
Let's see if I can tell it to
you with some kind of clarity.

768
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:20,254
Millie and Andy, and the young doctor
and I went to the Stardust Ballroom.

769
01:07:21,691 --> 01:07:24,753
He actually didn't want to come
and stay in the first place, and...

770
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,550
I don't know what Millie told him about me,
but I'm sure he was very disappointed.

771
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,169
Don't look so sad. I had a
wonderful time this evening.

772
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,913
I met a fellow. He's a butcher.

773
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,599
And...

774
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:44,645
Well, we sat on a luncheonette
at Grand Concord...

775
01:07:44,646 --> 01:07:48,549
I think from 9 o'clock
until midnight.

776
01:07:48,951 --> 01:07:50,522
Talking.

777
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,636
That's all we did. Talk.

778
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,283
I'm just trying to figure out why
did I enjoyed myself so much.

779
01:07:58,284 --> 01:08:00,580
We just sat and had pie.

780
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,203
He's gonna call me tomorrow.

781
01:08:03,634 --> 01:08:08,363
I have something to tell you. I decided
to take the job in Port Chester.

782
01:08:08,863 --> 01:08:14,411
Because it's really a question of maturity.
Do you know what I mean? I mean...

783
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:19,113
I could go on living here and
be a girl all my life, papa.

784
01:08:21,204 --> 01:08:25,489
By the way, the reason I mentioned
he's a butcher is because...

785
01:08:25,595 --> 01:08:28,887
he's gonna call me tomorrow
after lunch and...

786
01:08:29,862 --> 01:08:33,806
He's very self conscious of the
social status of a butcher and...

787
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:39,298
Well, he's calling on the phone,
not coming over here. But...

788
01:08:39,421 --> 01:08:41,757
When he does I just wanted to...

789
01:08:43,576 --> 01:08:46,284
Well, we'll see that
when we come to it

790
01:08:47,796 --> 01:08:50,327
You don't know what
I'm talking about?

791
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:54,767
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

792
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,049
You know? When we
left the ballroom...

793
01:08:59,555 --> 01:09:03,099
he began to talk so
much he couldn't stop.

794
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:07,287
It was so funny. He just kept
raddling and raddling. And he...

795
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,802
I don't think I'll be able
to stop talking now myself.

796
01:09:15,814 --> 01:09:19,505
Listen. I'm going to bed.
I'll see you tomorrow.

797
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,906
Good night.

798
01:09:27,735 --> 01:09:32,104
What I forgot to tell is that I expect
the phone call at two thirty, so I'll...

799
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,858
I won't be able to go
to the movies with you.

800
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,941
Good night.

801
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,921
You... You did have a
good time tonight, dear?

802
01:09:45,164 --> 01:09:49,346
Yes, ma. It was very pleasant.

803
01:10:03,736 --> 01:10:06,651
I did not understand much
about that, did you?

804
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,762
She's said she's gonna
take that job. I'm glad.

805
01:10:12,001 --> 01:10:16,849
I love that girl so much, Alice. But she
should learn to stand on her own feet.

806
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,038
I hope that young man
calls tomorrow at 2:30.

807
01:10:21,124 --> 01:10:22,869
I really do.

808
01:11:10,402 --> 01:11:12,846
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

809
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:16,725
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

810
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:20,604
Hey!

811
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:09,210
Hey, Ma. You know what
I think I'm gonna do?

812
01:12:09,211 --> 01:12:12,155
I think I'm gonna buy Patsy's shop.

813
01:12:25,603 --> 01:12:28,313
You hear what I said, Ma?

814
01:12:28,314 --> 01:12:32,150
This is how I figure. We got 33-odd
hundred dollars in the bank,

815
01:12:32,151 --> 01:12:35,695
so I'm gonna have to take it out to
buy the shop. So what do you think?

816
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:37,238
I don't know.

817
01:12:37,239 --> 01:12:40,325
I'm a good butcher. I think
I'll make out pretty good.

818
01:12:40,326 --> 01:12:43,536
I wanna ask Thomas about this,
but I got my own ideas.

819
01:12:43,537 --> 01:12:45,538
Come on, Marty. It's nine o'clock.

820
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:50,084
Listen, Ma, you mind comin' home alone
from church because I wanna find Angie?

821
01:12:50,085 --> 01:12:52,796
- I think he's sore at me for somethin'.
- OK.

822
01:12:52,797 --> 01:12:56,925
Ma, what I wanna ask you is, is Thomas
bringing Aunt Catherine here or what,

823
01:12:56,926 --> 01:12:59,219
because I wanna see him?

824
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:03,264
I think Thomas is gonna bring Aunt
Caterina over here, but I don't know.

825
01:13:03,265 --> 01:13:06,518
Now, please go outside because
I gotta put on my clothes.

826
01:13:06,519 --> 01:13:10,005
All right. So what are you
gettin' so sore about?

827
01:13:16,028 --> 01:13:18,738
Marty? Please excuse what I say.

828
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:21,183
OK, Ma.

829
01:13:25,121 --> 01:13:30,609
- Don't you think I feel lousy about it, too?
- I don't wanna talk any more about it.

830
01:13:30,918 --> 01:13:34,045
I don't think I got an hour's
sleep the whole night.

831
01:13:34,046 --> 01:13:37,257
Last night was the first time
I ever heard my mother cry.

832
01:13:37,258 --> 01:13:40,260
- Tommy, I...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

833
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:45,557
I know what you're gonna say. A man's
gotta stop bein' his mother's baby.

834
01:13:45,558 --> 01:13:48,309
She's my mother. I have
some feelin' about her.

835
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:52,147
- Why am I always made to be the louse?
- I don't wanna talk about it!

836
01:13:52,148 --> 01:13:56,568
Look, Tommy... Tommy, I love you
and I know you feel lousy right now,

837
01:13:56,569 --> 01:14:00,280
but we'll never be happy unless we have
a chance to work out our own lives.

838
01:14:00,281 --> 01:14:06,019
We can't keep talkin' in whispers the rest
of our lives. We gotta have some privacy.

839
01:14:09,999 --> 01:14:12,917
Ma! Can't you wait five minutes?
I'll drive you over.

840
01:14:12,918 --> 01:14:15,336
- I just gotta put on a shirt.
- Go to mass.

841
01:14:15,337 --> 01:14:18,256
I got time to go to mass.
I'll go to 11 o'clock mass.

842
01:14:18,257 --> 01:14:20,425
Let me drive you
over, will you, Ma?

843
01:14:20,426 --> 01:14:22,870
Thomas, leave me alone.

844
01:14:29,602 --> 01:14:33,354
All right, get dressed because
we're gonna drive my mother over.

845
01:14:33,355 --> 01:14:36,107
Why couldn't you get along
with her, make an effort?

846
01:14:36,108 --> 01:14:39,068
She's hard to get along with.
All I asked you was to try!

847
01:14:39,069 --> 01:14:42,055
- Tommy...
- I don't wanna hear any more about it!

848
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:19,192
Hello, Aunt Theresa.

849
01:15:19,193 --> 01:15:21,152
Hello, Tommy. How you feel?

850
01:15:21,153 --> 01:15:25,240
Ah, my mother... drives me crazy. I had
to beg her to let me drive her over here.

851
01:15:25,241 --> 01:15:27,909
- Oh.
- She's always gotta be the big martyr.

852
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:30,286
Please, go to mass, huh?

853
01:15:30,287 --> 01:15:34,707
This one, he wake up this morning
with salt in his nose. Do this! Do that!

854
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:38,111
Please leave me alone, huh?

855
01:15:38,671 --> 01:15:40,296
- Hello, Thomas.
- Hiya.

856
01:15:40,297 --> 01:15:43,341
Hello, Aunt Catherine.
You gonna go to mass with us?

857
01:15:43,342 --> 01:15:45,510
- I was to mass two hours ago.
- Oh, good.

858
01:15:45,511 --> 01:15:48,429
Make yourself at home.
The refrigerator's loaded.

859
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,932
You go upstairs, take
any room you want, OK?

860
01:15:50,933 --> 01:15:53,393
Thomas!

861
01:15:53,394 --> 01:15:56,630
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Ah.

862
01:15:57,189 --> 01:16:00,024
Oh, hi, Virginia. Oh, you
brought him over, huh?

863
01:16:00,025 --> 01:16:02,527
Let me hold him for a minute.

864
01:16:02,528 --> 01:16:07,991
Hey, Petey boy. Yeah. You're
sure gettin' fat. You know that?

865
01:16:07,992 --> 01:16:11,244
Yeah. You're bigger
than a leg o' lamb now.

866
01:16:11,245 --> 01:16:14,330
So, Tom, like I was tellin'
you when you was over here,

867
01:16:14,331 --> 01:16:18,751
my boss wants to sell his shop, because
he wants to move out to California.

868
01:16:18,752 --> 01:16:22,005
- What are you so sore about?
- Shut up. Will you do me a favour?

869
01:16:22,006 --> 01:16:25,800
So, Tommy, he does about
$12-1300 gross. The rent's $102.

870
01:16:25,801 --> 01:16:29,095
The problem is the supermarkets.
That's what I wanna ask you.

871
01:16:29,096 --> 01:16:31,473
If I get together with
other merchants...

872
01:16:31,474 --> 01:16:35,560
What about the time she wanted to make
dinner, but you wouldn't let her?

873
01:16:35,561 --> 01:16:39,481
- Once a month she can't use the kitchen.
- She could use it any time.

874
01:16:39,482 --> 01:16:42,567
- You had to be the boss.
- She wouldn't use my pots and pans.

875
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:46,362
- Pots and pans, my foot!
- You want me to buy new pots and pans?

876
01:16:46,363 --> 01:16:49,699
Tommy... Tommy... Look, just
give me a couple of minutes.

877
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,828
I told Mr Otari I'd let him know tomorrow.
You and Virginia can fight any time.

878
01:16:53,829 --> 01:16:57,332
Listen, I wanna know about
individualised mark-ups.

879
01:16:57,333 --> 01:17:01,002
Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli
is the dairyman and the grocer,

880
01:17:01,003 --> 01:17:03,880
so suppose I work on a 35%
mark-up, but he works on a...

881
01:17:03,881 --> 01:17:09,260
- Do you know what you're talkin' about?
- No, I don't. That's why I'm askin' you!

882
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:11,221
Why d'you wanna buy a shop?

883
01:17:11,222 --> 01:17:15,308
You got a good job, no wife, no
responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you.

884
01:17:15,309 --> 01:17:18,478
What do you wanna buy a shop for?
Take the baby, will ya?

885
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:23,483
If he wants $5,000 down, you'll have
to carry a mortgage: $60, $70 a month.

886
01:17:23,484 --> 01:17:27,737
You're single with no responsibilities.
Stay that way. Take my advice.

887
01:17:27,738 --> 01:17:30,115
Why are you yellin'?
He's askin' advice.

888
01:17:30,116 --> 01:17:33,034
Yeah, Tom, but Patsy's shop
is a specialised trade.

889
01:17:33,035 --> 01:17:37,914
- Supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
- Who buys Italian? Think my wife does?

890
01:17:37,915 --> 01:17:42,502
She goes to the A&P, gets a lamb chop
wrapped in Cellophane, and that's dinner!

891
01:17:42,503 --> 01:17:45,588
- All right.
- I know the problem of the supermarkets,

892
01:17:45,589 --> 01:17:48,758
but I was talkin' to
this girl last night...

893
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:52,137
Look, Marty, will you see my
mother is nice and comfortable?

894
01:17:52,138 --> 01:17:55,640
- Oh, sure. But this girl...
- What girl? What does she know?

895
01:17:55,641 --> 01:17:58,502
Marty, take care of
my mother, will ya?

896
01:18:12,032 --> 01:18:15,618
Hey, Ma, get ready, cos
I'll be down in a minute.

897
01:18:15,619 --> 01:18:18,063
- Hey, Caterina.
- Huh?

898
01:18:18,456 --> 01:18:24,002
Last night when I come home from your
house, Marty was here with a girl.

899
01:18:24,003 --> 01:18:26,212
- Who?
- Marty.

900
01:18:26,213 --> 01:18:27,755
Your son Marty?

901
01:18:27,756 --> 01:18:31,801
Well, which Marty you think would
be here in this house with a girl?

902
01:18:31,802 --> 01:18:35,054
- Were the lights on?
- Oh, sure.

903
01:18:35,055 --> 01:18:38,016
This girl is a college graduate.

904
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:43,730
They're the worst. College girls are
one step from the street, I tell you.

905
01:18:43,731 --> 01:18:48,234
My son Joseph's wife, you know,
she type on a typewriter.

906
01:18:48,235 --> 01:18:51,054
One step from the street.

907
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:55,575
This is the first time
Marty brang home a girl.

908
01:18:55,576 --> 01:19:00,856
She look like a nice girl. You know,
I think Marty has a feeling for this girl.

909
01:19:01,624 --> 01:19:05,027
You heard him sing?
Sing like that all morning.

910
01:19:05,503 --> 01:19:08,071
Well, that's all. You'll see.

911
01:19:08,339 --> 01:19:12,509
Today, tomorrow, in a week,
he's gonna say to you

912
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:18,306
"Hey, Ma, I'm tired of running around.
It's no good to be a single man."

913
01:19:18,307 --> 01:19:22,560
Then he's gonna say to you "Hey, Ma.
Why we need this old house?"

914
01:19:22,561 --> 01:19:27,357
"Why don't we sell this old house
and move in a nicer part of town?"

915
01:19:27,358 --> 01:19:29,317
"Nice little apartment."

916
01:19:29,318 --> 01:19:31,803
I don't sell this
house, I tell you that.

917
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:36,491
This is my husband's house.
I had six children in this house.

918
01:19:36,492 --> 01:19:38,535
You'll see.

919
01:19:38,536 --> 01:19:43,331
In a couple of months you gonna be
an old lady sleeping on a couch

920
01:19:43,332 --> 01:19:47,001
- in your daughter-in-law's house.
- Ah, Caterina!

921
01:19:47,002 --> 01:19:49,170
Where you go, rain go!

922
01:19:49,171 --> 01:19:52,632
Someday you gonna smile,
we gonna have a big holiday.

923
01:19:52,633 --> 01:19:56,511
Hey, Ma. What do you say, Ma?
It's gettin' a little late, huh?

924
01:19:56,512 --> 01:19:58,747
Sure.

925
01:20:00,933 --> 01:20:06,729
Boy, this place is really comin' to pieces.
Ma, I think we oughta sell this place.

926
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:09,315
The whole joint's goin' to pieces.

927
01:20:09,316 --> 01:20:14,888
Plumbing's rusty, everything. Now I'm
gonna have to replaster this whole place.

928
01:20:16,991 --> 01:20:19,409
You know what we oughta do, Ma?

929
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:23,329
Get one of those new apartments they're
buildin' on Southern Boulevard.

930
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:26,191
A nicer part of town, you know?

931
01:20:29,128 --> 01:20:32,197
- You all set, Ma?
- I'm set.

932
01:20:35,384 --> 01:20:38,495
- Goodbye, Aunt Catherine.
- Goodbye.

933
01:21:01,619 --> 01:21:03,369
We got a couple of minutes yet.

934
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:05,663
- Hi, Marty.
- Hi.

935
01:21:05,664 --> 01:21:07,957
Ma, fix your coat.

936
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:13,614
Hey, Marty, we're gonna sit in the back on
account of the baby. See you afterwards.

937
01:21:14,006 --> 01:21:17,326
That was a nice-looking
girl last night, huh?

938
01:21:18,594 --> 01:21:23,457
She wasn't a very good-looking girl,
but she look like a nice girl.

939
01:21:24,975 --> 01:21:28,353
I said she wasn't a very
good-looking girl, not pretty.

940
01:21:28,354 --> 01:21:30,855
I heard you, Ma.

941
01:21:30,856 --> 01:21:35,944
She look a little bit old for you.
About 35, 40 years old.

942
01:21:35,945 --> 01:21:37,904
She's 29, Ma.

943
01:21:37,905 --> 01:21:41,074
She's more than 29 years old.
That's what she tells you.

944
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:44,536
Buongiorno. Che bella giornata.
La messa comincia fra poco.

945
01:21:44,537 --> 01:21:47,397
She looked 35, 40 years old.

946
01:21:48,707 --> 01:21:51,443
She don't look like Italian girl.

947
01:21:52,795 --> 01:21:56,506
- I say, is she Italian girl?
- I don't know. I don't think so, Ma.

948
01:21:56,507 --> 01:21:59,451
She don't look like Italian to me.

949
01:22:00,261 --> 01:22:03,121
What family she comes from?

950
01:22:03,848 --> 01:22:07,543
I don't know. Something
about her I... I don't like.

951
01:22:08,144 --> 01:22:13,924
It's funny. The first time you meet the
girl, she comes to your empty house alone.

952
01:22:15,693 --> 01:22:19,279
These college girls, they all
one step from the street.

953
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,699
What are you talkin' about?
She's a nice girl.

954
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,561
She don't look Italian to me.

955
01:22:28,414 --> 01:22:32,709
- I don't like her.
- You only met her for two minutes.

956
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:36,087
- Don't bring her home no more.
- What didn't you like about her?

957
01:22:36,088 --> 01:22:40,675
I don't know. She don't look like Italian
to me. Plenty nice Italian girls around.

958
01:22:40,676 --> 01:22:42,719
Let's not fight about it.

959
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,930
Why are you gettin' so worked up?
I only met her last night.

960
01:22:45,931 --> 01:22:48,933
Probably not gonna see
her again anyhow.

961
01:22:48,934 --> 01:22:51,378
Come on.

962
01:23:03,115 --> 01:23:04,908
- Hello, Lou.
- Hiya, Marty.

963
01:23:04,909 --> 01:23:06,785
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hiya, Marty.

964
01:23:06,786 --> 01:23:09,229
Lou, let me have a Coke, will ya?

965
01:23:10,748 --> 01:23:14,584
Marty, I hear you really got
stuck with a dog last night.

966
01:23:14,585 --> 01:23:19,380
- Who told you that?
- Angie. Said she was scrawny-looking.

967
01:23:19,381 --> 01:23:21,825
She wasn't so bad.

968
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:26,387
- Was Angie here already?
- He was here last night till about two.

969
01:23:26,388 --> 01:23:28,415
Oh.

970
01:23:40,402 --> 01:23:44,405
Hey, Ralph, how'd you make out
with those nurses last night?

971
01:23:44,406 --> 01:23:47,267
Oh, Marty. Man, didn't I tell ya?

972
01:23:47,785 --> 01:23:51,162
You know that one that was for
you, the one in the back?

973
01:23:51,163 --> 01:23:55,416
We went over to Leo's house, you know?
So she got loaded drunk.

974
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:57,627
You should have seen
what she was doin'.

975
01:23:57,628 --> 01:24:00,880
Even the people downstairs
started bangin' on the walls.

976
01:24:00,881 --> 01:24:04,217
So in the middle of the whole
thing the landlord comes in.

977
01:24:04,218 --> 01:24:07,137
These crazy girls are
runnin' around drunk.

978
01:24:07,138 --> 01:24:09,973
So we gotta get rid of her
because of the landlord.

979
01:24:09,974 --> 01:24:16,187
So Leo's talkin' to the landlord while we're
tryin' to get this crazy girl out the window.

980
01:24:16,188 --> 01:24:19,716
This crazy girl, she even
left her shoes up there!

981
01:24:26,157 --> 01:24:28,032
So how'd you make out?

982
01:24:28,033 --> 01:24:30,894
- I had a nice time.
- Yeah?

983
01:24:33,706 --> 01:24:37,693
Uh, she's a nice girl. Oh,
I didn't try anything.

984
01:24:40,588 --> 01:24:46,034
I just met her last night, you know.
She's a nice girl. We just talked.

985
01:24:47,511 --> 01:24:52,291
Uh... uh... We just talked.

986
01:25:00,232 --> 01:25:05,971
Listen, Ralph, if you see Angie, tell him
I went home. I'll see him after lunch, huh?

987
01:25:17,124 --> 01:25:20,402
- I wanna talk to you.
- I don't wanna talk right now.

988
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:55,161
So the whole book winds up...
Marty. Hey, Marty.

989
01:25:55,162 --> 01:25:58,832
So the whole book winds up, Mike
Hammer - he's in the room with this doll.

990
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:02,001
So he says "You rat,
you're the murderer."

991
01:26:02,002 --> 01:26:05,630
So she begins to con him.
She tells him how she loves him.

992
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:09,175
Then bam! He shoots her
right in the stomach.

993
01:26:09,176 --> 01:26:13,680
So she's layin' there, gaspin' for breath,
and she says "How could you do that?"

994
01:26:13,681 --> 01:26:16,500
He says "It was easy."

995
01:26:17,017 --> 01:26:20,311
Boy, that Mickey Spillane,
boy, he could write.

996
01:26:20,312 --> 01:26:22,272
I read everything he ever wrote.

997
01:26:22,273 --> 01:26:25,733
Come on! We got a whole pot.
We give you a plate of your own.

998
01:26:25,734 --> 01:26:28,653
I couldn't eat nothin'.
My mother just fed me.

999
01:26:28,654 --> 01:26:33,116
What I like about Mickey Spillane
is he knows how to handle women.

1000
01:26:33,117 --> 01:26:37,912
In one book he picks up this tomato. She
was hit by a car and throws a pass at him.

1001
01:26:37,913 --> 01:26:41,708
Then he meets two beautiful twins,
and they throw a pass at him.

1002
01:26:41,709 --> 01:26:45,336
Then he meets a beautiful society
dame, and she throws a pass at him.

1003
01:26:45,337 --> 01:26:47,922
That Mickey Spillane,
he could really write.

1004
01:26:47,923 --> 01:26:51,676
Anybody wanna go down Van Courtland
Park, watch the ball games?

1005
01:26:51,677 --> 01:26:54,663
It's only a little bit
after two o'clock.

1006
01:26:55,598 --> 01:26:58,933
- Where you goin'?
- To call up that girl from last night.

1007
01:26:58,934 --> 01:27:02,421
- Thought I'd take her to a movie.
- You kiddin'?

1008
01:27:04,273 --> 01:27:07,525
Now, listen, Angie, you were
very impolite last night.

1009
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:10,403
I introduced you to that
girl, you just walked off.

1010
01:27:10,404 --> 01:27:13,573
- Why'd you do that?
- It got me mad, that's why.

1011
01:27:13,574 --> 01:27:16,367
Hey, Jerry, show Marty
that picture, you know.

1012
01:27:16,368 --> 01:27:19,037
Put it away! My mother's
out on the porch.

1013
01:27:19,038 --> 01:27:22,791
- I wonder where they find those girls.
- They're Hollywood starlets.

1014
01:27:22,792 --> 01:27:24,959
Put it away. My mother'll walk in.

1015
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,171
Hey, Marty, let's go down
72nd Street area tonight.

1016
01:27:28,172 --> 01:27:32,217
I don't feel like goin', Angie.
I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.

1017
01:27:32,218 --> 01:27:34,761
Boy, you must have made
out good last night.

1018
01:27:34,762 --> 01:27:38,431
- We just talked.
- Boy, she must be some talker.

1019
01:27:38,432 --> 01:27:40,975
She must have been
about 50 years old.

1020
01:27:40,976 --> 01:27:45,313
The way I figure, a guy oughta marry
a girl 20 years younger than he is,

1021
01:27:45,314 --> 01:27:49,150
so that when he's 40 she's still
a real pretty doll of 21.

1022
01:27:49,151 --> 01:27:52,804
That means he'd have to marry the
girl when she was one year old.

1023
01:27:52,822 --> 01:27:55,281
You're right. I never
thought of that!

1024
01:27:55,282 --> 01:27:59,244
- She wasn't so bad-lookin'.
- She must have kept you in the shadows.

1025
01:27:59,245 --> 01:28:03,164
You don't wanna hang around with dogs.
It gives you a bad reputation.

1026
01:28:03,165 --> 01:28:05,959
Let's go down to 72nd Street.

1027
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:09,254
I told this dog I'd call
her up today, about 2.30.

1028
01:28:09,255 --> 01:28:11,464
Brush her!

1029
01:28:11,465 --> 01:28:14,134
You wanna come with me
tonight or go with that dog?

1030
01:28:14,135 --> 01:28:17,720
- Why you gettin' so sore?
- Cos I looked all over for you last night!

1031
01:28:17,721 --> 01:28:22,100
Another book that I read by Mickey
Spillane, I can't remember the name of it,

1032
01:28:22,101 --> 01:28:24,727
but he finds this red-headed
doll on the streets

1033
01:28:24,728 --> 01:28:28,440
and he gives her some dough
because he feels sorry for her.

1034
01:28:28,441 --> 01:28:33,220
Wait a minute. I think that's the same
book I was tellin' you about before.

1035
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,658
- You didn't like her at all?
- A nothin'. A real nothin'.

1036
01:28:38,659 --> 01:28:42,203
You know somethin'.
This Mickey Spillane.

1037
01:28:42,204 --> 01:28:45,065
Boy, he sure can write.

1038
01:29:43,057 --> 01:29:45,959
So, what are you gonna
do tonight, Marty?

1039
01:29:46,769 --> 01:29:49,104
I don't know, Ma.
I'm all knocked out.

1040
01:29:49,105 --> 01:29:51,965
I may just hang around
the house and...

1041
01:29:57,154 --> 01:30:00,865
Maybe I'll go down and see what
Angie and the boys are doin'.

1042
01:30:00,866 --> 01:30:03,310
I'll see ya later, Ma.

1043
01:30:08,124 --> 01:30:11,735
We had... I don't wanna
talk like that fella.

1044
01:30:13,003 --> 01:30:15,004
We had the extreme privilege

1045
01:30:15,005 --> 01:30:18,925
of having Jackie Gleason make
his TV debut on our show.

1046
01:30:18,926 --> 01:30:22,929
So tonight on our
anniversary show...

1047
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:25,374
I'm doing it, huh?

1048
01:30:27,435 --> 01:30:29,878
Oh, now, leave me alone, will ya?

1049
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,216
You know, he scares
the life out of me.

1050
01:30:45,161 --> 01:30:48,288
- What time is it?
- It's about eight o'clock.

1051
01:30:48,289 --> 01:30:50,748
You don't feel like
goin' to 72nd Street?

1052
01:30:50,749 --> 01:30:54,169
It'll take an hour and an hour back.
The whole evening's gone.

1053
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:59,174
What's playin' on Fordham Road? There's
a good picture in the Loew's Paradise.

1054
01:30:59,175 --> 01:31:01,509
Feel like workin'
up a game of cards?

1055
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:06,306
Come on, let's go down to 72nd Street.
We'll wind up with somethin'.

1056
01:31:06,307 --> 01:31:10,477
I'll never forgive La Guardia for cuttin'
out burlesque outta New York City.

1057
01:31:10,478 --> 01:31:13,688
There's a burlesque in Union City.
Let's go to Union City.

1058
01:31:13,689 --> 01:31:16,649
You don't even wanna ride a
half-hour on the subway,

1059
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:19,819
now you wanna go all the
way down to Union City.

1060
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:24,574
I feel like playin' cards. I saw Richie Rizzo.
That's what he said he felt like doin'.

1061
01:31:24,575 --> 01:31:28,620
I don't feel like playin' cards.
What do you feel like doin', Angie?

1062
01:31:28,621 --> 01:31:31,915
I don't know. What do
you feel like doin'?

1063
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:34,834
I don't know. George, what
are you doin' tonight?

1064
01:31:34,835 --> 01:31:38,546
"What are you doin' tonight?"
"I don't know. What are you doin'?"

1065
01:31:38,547 --> 01:31:40,715
The burlesque! Loew's Paradise!

1066
01:31:40,716 --> 01:31:43,885
Miserable and lonely.
Miserable and lonely and stupid.

1067
01:31:43,886 --> 01:31:47,347
What am I, crazy or somethin'?
I got somethin' good here.

1068
01:31:47,348 --> 01:31:50,225
What am I hangin' around
with you guys for?

1069
01:31:50,226 --> 01:31:54,145
Wait a minute, will you?
What's the matter with you?

1070
01:31:54,146 --> 01:31:58,942
You don't like her. My mother don't like
her. She's a dog, and I'm a fat, ugly man.

1071
01:31:58,943 --> 01:32:03,947
Well, all I know is I had a good time last
night. I'm gonna have a good time tonight.

1072
01:32:03,948 --> 01:32:08,743
If we have enough good times together,
I'm gonna beg that girl to marry me.

1073
01:32:08,744 --> 01:32:12,330
If we make a party on New Year's,
I got a date for that party.

1074
01:32:12,331 --> 01:32:15,242
You don't like her, that's too bad!

1075
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:31,266
Hey, Ange, when are you
gonna get married?

1076
01:32:31,267 --> 01:32:33,560
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

1077
01:32:33,561 --> 01:32:36,771
You're 33 years old. All your
kid brothers are married.

1078
01:32:36,772 --> 01:32:39,349
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

1079
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:42,068
Hello?

1080
01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:43,611
Excuse me, Ange.

1081
01:32:43,612 --> 01:32:45,856
Hello, Clara?

1082
01:33:01,699 --> 01:33:05,511
<i>What happened? What happened?
Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty!</i>

1083
01:33:05,541 --> 01:33:09,861
<i>Hey, Marty, what happened with you?</i>

1084
01:33:09,993 --> 01:33:13,564
<i>Saturday we had a party
A party.</i>

1085
01:33:13,595 --> 01:33:17,697
<i>Frankie and Lou, everybody but you.</i>

1086
01:33:17,727 --> 01:33:21,351
<i>Where was you Thursday?
Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty!</i>

1087
01:33:21,381 --> 01:33:25,095
<i>Hey, Marty, for our bowling game?</i>

1088
01:33:25,129 --> 01:33:28,911
<i>It seems like a year since
we chug-a-lugged the beer.</i>

1089
01:33:28,941 --> 01:33:32,957
<i>Hey, Marty, you must
have a dame, a dame.</i>

1090
01:33:32,989 --> 01:33:36,436
<i>Hey, Marty, you must have a dame.</i>

1091
01:33:36,467 --> 01:33:41,922
<i>Must have a dame!</i>
