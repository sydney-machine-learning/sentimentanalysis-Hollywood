There's a bright golden
haze on the meadow

The corn is as high
as an elephant's eye

4
00:02:53,548 --> 00:03:01,639
And it looks like it's
climbin' clear up to the sky

5
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,310
Oh, what a beautiful morning

6
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,940
Oh, what a beautiful day

7
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:15,569
I got a beautiful feeling

is laughin' at me

Oh, what a beautiful morning

21
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,375
- Hi, Aunt Eller!
- Don't scare me to death.

22
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,879
- What you doin' around here?
- I come a-singin' to you.

wasn't so young and smart-alecky,

why, I'd marry you and get you to
sit around at night and sing to me.

29
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,244
No, you wouldn't neither, 'cause I wouldn't
marry you nor none of your kinfolk.

30
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,287
- If I could help it.
- Oh, none of my kinfolks, huh?

31
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,623
And you can tell 'em
that too. All of 'em.

I ain't thought much about it yet.

35
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,426
- Bet you come over to ask Laurey.
- What if I did?

You askin' me too?
I'll wear my fascinator.

Is this all that's come a-callin' at
already 8:00 this Saturday morning?

44

You knowed it was me
before you opened the door.

45
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,126
- No such of a thing.
- Well, you did too.

You heared my voice.
You knowed it was me.

47
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,298
I heared someone singing
like a bullfrog in a pond.

48
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:26,510
You knowed it was me, so you set in
there, thinkin' up something mean to say.

49

I'm a good mind not to
ask you to the box social.

50
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,683
- Oh, you two.
- If you asked me, I wouldn't go with you.

51
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,977
Besides, how'd you take me?

52
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,688
You ain't bought a new buggy with
red wheels onto it, have you?

53
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,315
No, I ain't.

No.

Expect me to ride on
behind ol' Blue I guess.

57
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,532
You better ask that old Cummings
girl you took such a shine to.

58
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,745
If I was to ask you, Miss Laurey
smarty, there'd be a way to take ya.

Honey, here's the way it's gonna be

63
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:11,931
You will set behind a team
of snow-white horses

64
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:17,059
In the slickest gig you ever see

65
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,315
Chicks and ducks
and geese better scurry

66
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,318
When I take you out in the surrey

67
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,366
When I take you out in the
surrey with the fringe on top

68
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,369
Watch that fringe
and see how it flutters

69
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,330
When I drive them
high-steppin' strutters

70
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,041
Nosy pokes'll peek
through their shutters

71
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,044
And their eyes'll pop

72
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,297
The wheels are yeller
the upholstery's brown

73
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,217
The dashboard's genuine leather

74
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,387
With isinglass curtains
you can roll right down

75
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,598
In case there's
a change in the weather

76
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,726
Two bright sidelights
winkin' and blinkin'

00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,729
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'

78
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,440
You can keep your rig
if you're thinkin'

79
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,193
That I'd "keer" to swap

80
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:12,783
For that shiny little surrey
with the fringe on the top

81
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,953
Would you say the fringe
was made of silk

82
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,497
(LAUGHS)

83
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,910
Wouldn't have
no other kind but silk

84
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:27,297
Has it really got a team
of snow-white horses

85
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:33,676
One's like snow
The other's more like milk

86
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,766
All the world will fly in a flurry

87
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,186
When I take you out in the surrey

88
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:47,109
When I take you out in the
surrey with the fringe on top

89
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,446
When we hit that road
hell for leather

90
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,532
Cats and dogs'll
dance in the heather

91
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,118
Birds and frogs'll
sing all together

92
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,079
And the toads will hop

93
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,207
The wind'll whistle
as we rattle along

94
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,044
The cows'll moo in the clover

95
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,464
The river will ripple out
a whispered song

96
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,675
And whisper it over and over

97
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,970
(SOFTLY) Don't you wish
you'd go on forever

98
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,015
Don't you wish you'd go on forever

99
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,976
Don't you wish you'd go on forever

100
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,812
And it'd never stop

101
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:30,271
In that shiny little surrey
with the fringe on the top

102
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,070
You'd sure feel like a queen
settin' up in that carriage.

103
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,992
Only she talked to me
so mean a while back,

104
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,828
- I'm a good mind not to take her.
- I ain't said I was goin'.

105
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,373
- Well, I ain't asked ya.
- Where'd you get such a rig at?

106
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:47,336
I'll bet he's went and hired a rig over
at Claremore, thinkin' I'd go with him.

107
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,881
I did not hire it. I made the
whole thing up out of my head.

108
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,717
- What? Made it up?
- Dashboard and all.

109
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,886
(LAUGHING)

110
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,890
Get off the place, you!

111
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,602
Aunt Eller, make him get hisself
out of here! Tellin' me lies.

112
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:08,398
Now hold on. Makin' up a few "purties"
ain't agin no law I know of.

113
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,568
Besides, don't you wish
there was such a rig though?

114
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:16,031
You could go to the play party and do a
hoedown till morning if you was a mind to.

115
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,576
Then when you was all wore out,
why, I'd just lift you onto the surrey,

116
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:24,581
jump up alongside you, and we'd
just point the horses home.

117
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,080
I can just picture the whole thing.

118
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:33,715
I can see the stars gettin' blurry

119
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:38,554
When we ride back home
in the surrey

120
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,891
Ridin' slowly home in the surrey

121
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:48,772
With the fringe on top

122
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,819
I can feel the day gettin' older

123
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,615
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder

124
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:03,579
Noddin', droopin'
close to my shoulder

125
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,584
Till it falls, kerplop

126
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:13,964
The sun is swimmin'
on the rim of a hill

127
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:18,969
The moon is takin' a header

128
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,641
And just as I'm thinkin'
all the earth is still

129
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:34,484
A lark'll wake up in the medder

130
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:39,740
Hush, you bird my baby's a-sleepin'

131
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:45,204
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'

132
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,917
Whoa, you team and
just keep a-creepin'

133
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:54,963
At a slow clip-clop

134
00:11:54,964 --> 00:12:00,052
Don't you hurry with the surrey

135
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:04,514
With the fringe

136
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,810
On the

137
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:17,146
Top

138
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,201
- Only... Only there ain't no such rig.
- Well...

139
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,328
Why'd you come around here with
your stories and your lies,

140
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,913
gettin' me all worked up?

141
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,123
Who'd wanna ride
alongside of you anyway?

142
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,043
Why don't you grab her and kiss her
when she acts that a-way, Curly?

143
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,837
- She's just aching for you to, I bet.
- I won't even speak to him,

144
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,714
let alone allow him to kiss me...

145
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,385
the braggin', bowlegged,
wished-he'd-had-a-sweetheart bum!

146
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,347
She likes you quite a lot.

147
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,804
She liked me any more,
she'd sic the dogs onto me.

148
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,313
- Hello, Jud.
- Hello, yourself.

149
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,530
Listen, who's the low filthy sneak
Laurey's got her cap set for?

150
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,533
- You.
- Never mind that.

151
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,702
There must be plenty of
men a-tryin' to spark her.

152
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,038
- Plenty.
- What about him?

153
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,374
Oh, she wouldn't take up
with a fella like that,

154
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,376
that bullet-colored,
growly hired hand.

155
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,461
Now, don't you go say
nothin' agin Jud.

156
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,588
Best hired hand I ever had.

157
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,841
Just about runs
the farm by hisself.

158
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,386
Well, two women couldn't do it.
You oughta know 'at.

159
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,013
He's around all the time, ain't he?

160
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,263
Takes his meals with you and
sleeps down in the smokehouse.

161
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,270
I changed my mind about
cleaning the henhouse today.

162
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:37,024
I gotta quit early 'cause I'm driving
Laurey to the party tonight.

163
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,274
- You're driving Laurey?
- I asked her.

164
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:52,039
Well, wouldn't that
just make you bawl?

165
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,042
Don't forget, Aunt Eller. You and
me still got a date together.

166
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,211
How we going, Curly,
in that rig you made up?

167
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,630
That there ain't
no made-up rig, you hear?

168
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,175
I done hired it over to Claremore.

169
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,097
- Why don't you go with him?
- I can't. I promised Jud.

171
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,684

and too bigheaded,

the last minute to ask me.

173
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,816
Aunt Eller, are you really
going with Curly tonight?

174
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,444
I sure am. You didn't want him.

175
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,780
But you could go with me and Jud.

176
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,782

I picked mine.

you want it, ain't it?

I will, Aunt Eller. You see you got
your beauty spots fastened on proper,

184
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,975
so as you won't lose
them off, you hear?

Well, you can't just go around
kissing every man that asks ya.

00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,637
Yeah, they told me.

wrong since I been 10

333
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,862
I heared a lot of stories

334
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:22,575
And I reckon they are true

335
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:26,579
About how girls are put upon by men

336
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,500
I know I mustn't fall into the pit

337
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,670
But when I'm with a feller

338
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,340
I fergit

339
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:43,095
I'm just a girl who cain't say no

340
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,807
I'm in a terrible fix

341
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,853
I always say come on, let's go

342
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,273
Just when I oughta say nix

343
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:58,444
When a person tries to kiss a girl

344
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:02,156
I know she oughta
give his face a smack

345
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:06,285
But as soon as someone kisses me

346
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:10,331
I somehow sorta wanna kiss him back

347
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:14,168
I'm just a fool when lights are low

348
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,172
I cain't be prissy and quaint

349
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:22,051
I ain't the type that can faint

350
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:25,513
How can I be what I ain't

351
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,890
I cain't

352
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:33,771
Say no

353
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,400
What you gonna do
when a fella gets flirty

354
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,568
And starts to talk purty

355
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,570
What you gonna do

356
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:45,157
Supposin' that he says that
your lips are like cherries

357
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,159
Or roses or berries

358
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,161
What you gonna do

359
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,331
Supposin' that he says that
you're sweeter 'an cream

360
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:56,585
And he's gotta have cream or die

361
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,836
What you gonna do
when he talks that way

362
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,385
Spit in his eye

363
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:08,222
I'm just a girl who cain't say no

364
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,726
Kissing's my favorite food

365
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:15,855
With or without the mistletoe

366
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,317
I'm in a holiday mood

367
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:23,529
Other girls are coy
and hard to catch

368
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,074
But other girls
ain't havin' any fun

369
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:31,162
Every time I lose a wrestlin' match

370
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:35,416
I have a funny feelin' that I won

371
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:39,253
Though I can feel the undertow

372
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,840
I never make a complaint

373
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,927
Till it's too late for restraint

374
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,139
Then when I want to I cain't

375
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,767
I cain't

376
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,769
Say

377
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,270
No

378
00:30:59,483 --> 00:30:59,606
It's like I told you, Laurey,
I get sorry for 'em.

379
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,942
It's like I told you, Laurey,
I get sorry for 'em.

380
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,944
And now that old Will
has to come home.

381
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,615
First thing you know, he'll start talking
pretty to me and changing my mind back.

382
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,951
- But Will wants to marry you.
- So does Ali Hakim.

383
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,080
- Did he ask you about marryin'?
- Not directly.

384
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,082
But how I know this,
he said this morning

385
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,126
that he wanted for me to ride
with him to the end of the world.

386
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,631
Well, if we drove only as far as "Catoosy,"
he couldn't bring me home till morning,

387
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,633
and that means a wedding, don't it?

388
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,882
Not to a peddler, it don't.

00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,404
I've been waiting for you to show
your face again, old peddler-man.

392
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,571
Remember what you told me?

393
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,782
You said that eggbeater you
sold me would beat up eggs

394

Now, Aunt Eller, just listen.

396
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,580
Don't you Aunt Eller me,
you little wart. I'm mad.

397
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,376
If the eggbeater don't work, I give you
something just as good. A present.

398
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,503
I wouldn't have it.

399
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:07,007
- What is it?
- Real silk. Made in Persia.

400
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,010
What would I do with
an old Persian garter?

401
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,763
It looks pretty.
Now gimme the other one.

Which one? Oh, you want to buy
this one to match that one?

00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,522
I can let you have it for 50 cents.

405
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,275
Do you want me to get that eggbeater
and ram it down your windpipe?

406
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,277
- Gimme that.

Well, I never wear 'em myself,
but I sure do like to look at 'em.

411
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,374
How about these?

412
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,920
Yeah, they's all right

Me? Of course I want something.

I want a buckle made out of shiny
silver to fasten onto my shoes.

418
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:05,065
I want a dress with lace. I want
perfume. I want to be purty.

00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,694
- I wanna smell like a honeysuckle vine.
- Give her a cake of soap.

420
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,489
I want things
I can't tell you about.

421
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,241
Not only things to look at
and hold in your hand,

422
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,619
but things to happen to you,

423
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,166
things so nice that if they ever did happen
to you, your heart would quit beating.

A secret formula,
belong to pharaoh's daughter.

- Smellin' salts.
- But a special kind of smelling salts.

Here, read what it says
on the label.

429
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,642
You take a deep breath,
and you see everything clear.

430
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:43,771
That's what pharaoh's daughter used to do
when she had to decide what dress to wear

431
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,148
or which prince she ought to marry.

432
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,150
She would take a whiff of this.

433
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,028
- I'll take a bottle of that, Mr. Peddler.
- Oh, precious stuff.

434
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,113
- How much?
- Two bits.

435
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,784
- Throwin' away your money.
- Helps you decide what to do.

436
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,786
Put your trappings away
and come inside.

437
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:02,207
Come along, Laurey. Maybe we can
find him something to eat and drink.

438
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:09,421
Ali, Laurey and me
been having an argument.

439
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,132
- About what, baby?
- About what you meant

440
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,344
when you said that about drivin'
with me to the end of the world.

441
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,930
Well, I didn't really mean
to the end of the world.

442
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,054
Well, then how far
did you wanna go?

443
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,645
About as far as say... Claremore.

444
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,064
- What's at Claremore?
- The hotel.

445
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,233
In front is a veranda,
inside is the lobby

446
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,687
and upstairs, baby,
might be paradise.

447
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,151
I thought they's just bedrooms.

448
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,692
For you and me, baby, paradise.

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,245

You do wanna marry me.

- Don'tcha?
- Oh, Ado Annie... What did you say?

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,502
I said you do wanna marry me,
don'tcha? What'd you say?

452
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,879
I didn't say nothing.

How's the sweetest little 120
pounds of sugar in the territory?

Don't mind the way I talk.

It's all right.
I'm gonna marry her.

- Marry her? On purpose?
- No such other thing!

It's a wonderful
thing to be married.

- I got a brother in Persia got six wife.
- Six wives all at once?

Why sure. That's the way they
do it in them countries.

466
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,131
Not always. I got another brother
in Persia only got one wife.

467
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,551
He's a bachelor.

468
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,762
You know what I got
for first prize at the fair?

469
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,931
- Fifty dollars.
- Oh, well, that was good.

470
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,559
- Fifty dollars.
- You catch on?

471
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,019
Your pa promised I could marry you

if'n I could ever get $50
together all at one time.

got much sense.

Well, this'll show him. You know
what I done with the $50?

477
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,702
- I spent it all on presents for you.
- Oh!

478
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,747
But if you spent it,
you ain't got no cash.

479
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,999
What I got's worth more than cash.

480
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,418
The fella that sold me
the stuff told me.

481
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,005
- But, Will...
- Stop saying "But, Will."

482
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,591
When do I get a little kiss?

00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,095
Oh, Ado Annie, honey, you ain't
been off my mind since I left,

484
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:24,890
all the time at the fairgrounds even
when I was chasing them steers.

485
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,810
I'd rope one under the hoofs,
and I'd pull him up real sharp,

486
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,772
and he'd land on his little old
rump and then I'd think of you.

487
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,066
Don't start talkin' purty.

488
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,736
See'd a lot of pretty girls in Kansas
City. I didn't give one a look.

489
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,699
How could you see 'em if
you didn't give 'em a look?

490
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,243
I mean, I didn't
look lovin' at them,

491
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,245
the way I look at you.

492
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:46,337
Oh, Will, please don't look
like that. I cain't bear it.

493
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:50,791
Oh, Will, please don't look
like that. I cain't bear it.

494
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,335
I won't stop looking like this
till you give me a little ol' kiss.

Oh, well, what's a little old kiss?

00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:46,832
Yeah. Says she's 18.
Ha! Bet she's 19.

666
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:53,216
Are you really gonna drive to the
box social with that Jud fella?

667
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,844
- I reckon so. Why?
- Oh, nothing.

668
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,305
It's just that everybody seems
to expect me to take you.

669
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,267
Then maybe it's just
as well you ain't!

670
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,438
We don't want people
talkin' about us, do we?

671
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,981
Do you think people
really do talk about us?

672
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,817
Well, you know how they are,
like a swarm of mud wasps,

673
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,027
always gotta be buzzing
about something.

674
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,198
What are they saying,
that you're stuck on me?

675
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:20,493
Most of the talk is that
you're stuck on me.

676
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,867
Can't imagine how these
ugly rumors start.

677
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:23,831
Me, neither.

678
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:24,998
Me, neither.

679
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:32,505
Why do they think up stories
that link my name with yours

680
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:38,678
Why do the neighbors gossip
all day behind their doors

681
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:45,977
I know a way to prove what
they say is quite untrue

682
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:49,272
Here is the gist a practical list

683
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:51,774
Of don'ts

684
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,650
For you

685
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:01,034
Don't throw

686
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:05,246
Bouquets at me

687
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,374
Don't please

688
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,420
My folks too much

689
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:15,506
Don't laugh

690
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:19,594
At my jokes too much

691
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:25,350
People will say we're in love

692
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,768
Who laughs at your jokes?

693
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,771
Don't sigh

694
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:33,733
And gaze at me

695
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,736
Your sighs

696
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:40,448
Are so like mine

697
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:43,493
Your eyes

698
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:46,664
Mustn't glow like mine

699
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:54,379
People will say we're in love

700
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,507
Don't start

701
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,093
Collecting things

702
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,511
Like what?

703
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:07,685
Give me my rose and my glove

704
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,272
Sweetheart

705
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:17,777
They're suspecting things

706
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:22,782
People will say

707
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,743
We're in

708
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,038
Love

709
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,125
Some people claim
that you are to blame

710
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:35,461
As much as I

711
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,131
Why do you take the trouble to bake

712
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,634
My favorite pie

713
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,012
Grantin' your wish
I carved our initials

714
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:48,599
On that tree

715
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,978
Just keep a slice of all the advice

716
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:57,231
You give so free

717
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,697
Don't praise

718
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:06,826
My charm too much

719
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,829
Don't look

720
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:14,000
So vain with me

721
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,836
Don't stand

722
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:21,007
In the rain with me

723
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:28,014
People will say we're in love

724
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:31,017
Don't take

725
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:35,021
My arm too much

726
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:38,024
Don't keep

727
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,819
Your hand in mine

728
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,822
Your hand

729
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:48,868
Feels so grand in mine

730
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:55,541
People will say we're in love

731
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,544
Don't dance

732
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,248
All night with me

733
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:10,223
Till the stars fade from above

734
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:13,559
They'll see

735
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,231
It's all right with me

736
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:23,402
People will say

737
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,614
We're in

738
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:31,446
Love

739
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,795
Don't you think you could tell that Jud
fella you'd rather go with me tonight?

740
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,339
Curly...

741
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,501
No, I couldn't.

742
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,636
Oh, you couldn't.

743
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,515
Think I'll go down to the
smokehouse where Jud's at.

744
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:56,102
See what's so elegant about him, makes all
the girls want to go to parties with him.

745
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,681
- Curly!
- What?

746
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,857
Nothin'.

747
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,650
(QUACKING)

748
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,918
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

749
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,167
Well, open it, can't you?

750
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:27,884
Well, what do you want?

751
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:32,972
Oh, I... I done got through with
my business up there at the house.

752
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:35,551
I just thought I'd pay a call.

753
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,812
- You got a gun, I see.
- That's right.

754
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,690
It's a Colt .45.

755
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:43,983
Oh.

756
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,488
Say, now.

757
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:53,326
That there pink picture...
That's a naked woman, ain't it?

758
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:56,287
Plumb stark naked as a jaybird.

759
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,661
Shucks, that ain't a thing
to what I could show you.

760
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,837
Well, that's a good-lookin' rope.

761
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,040
Feels good too.

762
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,885
(GRUNTS)

763
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:14,222
That's a good, strong hook
you got there, Jud.

764
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,937
You know what? You could
hang yourself on that.

765
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,937
- I could what?
- You could hang yourself.

766
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,819
Yes, sir. Easy as
rollin' off a log.

767
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,405
Why, in five minutes
or less, with good luck,

768
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,617
- you could be dead as a doornail.
- What do you mean by that?

769
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,412
Oh, then folks would
come to your funeral.

770
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,831
- And they'd sing sad songs.
- (SCOFFS)

771
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,833
Why, they would.

772
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,584
You never know how many people
like you till you're dead.

773
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,840
You'd be laid out in a parlor.

774
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,176
All decked out in your best suit.

775
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,513
Your hair combed down slick,
high starched collar.

776
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:58,516
Lots of pretty flowers
all around you.

777
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,518
Would there be flowers, you think?

778
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,520
And palms too,

779
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,272
all around your coffin.

780
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,943
Folks would gather round,
and men would bare their heads.

781
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:11,112
Women would sniffle softly.

782
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:13,114
Some probably even faint,

783
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,449
ones that took a shine to
you whilst you was alive.

784
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,785
Now, what women
ever took a shine to me?

785
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:20,121
Why, lots of women.

786
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,289
Only they never come right out
and tell you how they feel,

787
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,959
unless you die first.

788
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,461
I guess maybe you're right.

789
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,798
They'd sure sing loud, though,
when the singin' would start.

790
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,594
Sing like their hearts would break.

791
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,847
Poor Jud is dead

792
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:42,143
Poor Jud Fry is dead

793
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:48,192
All gather round
his coffin now and cry

794
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,987
He had a heart of gold

795
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:57,324
And he wasn't very old

796
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:03,373
Oh, why did such a fella
have to die

797
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:08,002
Poor Jud is dead

798
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:12,506
Poor Jud Fry is dead

799
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:17,845
He's lookin', oh, so
peaceful and serene

800
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,473
And serene

801
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:24,018
He's all laid out to rest

802
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:28,522
With his hands across'd his chest

803
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:34,446
His fingernails
have never been so clean

804
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,741
And then the preacher'd
get up, and he'd say...

805
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:42,995
Folks, we are gathered here to moan
and groan over our brother Jud Fry

806
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,540
Who hung hisself up
by a rope in a smokehouse

807
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,543
And then there'd be weepin' and
wailin' from some of those women.

808
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,420
And then he'd say...

809
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,548
Jud was the most misunderstood
man in this territory

810
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,093
People used to think
he was a mean, ugly fella

811
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,679
And call him a dirty skunk
and ornery pig stealer

812
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,850
But the folks
that really knowed him

813
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:09,063
Knowed that beneath them two
dirty shirts he always wore

814
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:13,234
There beat a heart
as big as all outdoors

815
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,736
As big as all outdoors

816
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,405
Jud Fly loved his fellow man

817
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,367
He loved his fellow man

818
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,369
He loved the birds of the forests

819
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,162
And the beasts of the field

820
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,540
He loved the mice
and the vermin in the barn

821
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,251
And he treated the rats like equals

822
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,253
Which was right.

823
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,588
He loved all the little children

824
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,591
He loved everything
and everybody in the world

825
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,593
Only...

826
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,762
Only he never let on.

827
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,591
So nobody ever knowed it.

828
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,644
Poor Jud is dead

829
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:53,065
Poor Jud Fry is dead

830
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:57,945
His friends will weep and
wail for miles around

831
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,656
Miles around

832
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,951
The daisies in the dell

833
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:08,247
Will give out a different smell

834
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:14,296
Because poor Jud is
underneath the ground

835
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,883
Poor Jud is dead

836
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:22,845
A candle lights his head

837
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:28,058
He's layin' in a coffin
made of wood

838
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,768
Wood

839
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,771
And folks are feelin' sad

840
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:36,483
'Cause they used to treat him bad

841
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:42,156
And now they know their
friend has gone for good

842
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:44,158
Good

843
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,952
Poor Jud is dead

844
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:51,290
A candle lights his head

845

Where'd you work at
before you come up here?

862
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,026
Was up by Quapaw, wasn't it?

863
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,320

If it come to gettin' even with
somebody, I'd know how to do it.

Bartlett farm over by Sweetwater?

It was about five years ago.

875

Burned up the father and the
mother and the daughter.

876
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,397
It was a terrible accident.

877
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:40,350
That weren't no accident.

878
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,195
Fella told me.

879
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:49,199
Said that the hired hand was
stuck on the Bartlett girl

880
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,325
and one day he found her in the
hayloft with another fella.

881
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,457
And 'twas him
that burned the place?

882
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,294
Took him weeks to get the kerosene,
buying it at different times.

883

he made out like
it happened in Missouri,

885
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,252
but I knew all the time
it was the Bartlett farm.

01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,381

You ain't told me yet
what business you had here.

We got no cattle to sell
and no cow ponies.

890
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,983
Could be only one other thing
on this farm you could want

891
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,061

892
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,989

893

ought to tell Laurey

01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:41,418
And for that matter, somebody ought
to tell you once about yourself.

things you can do if you're a man.

You can live outdoors is one,

899
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,053
and you can live in a hole
is the other.

That's what I did.

1189
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:56,620
See the bag? Full of presents.

1190
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:59,790
Cost 50 bucks,
all I had in the world.

1191
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:03,460
- If you had that $50...
- I'd have Ado Annie and you'd lose her.

1192
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:05,288
Oh, yeah. I'd lose her.

1193
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:11,927
Let's see what you got in the bag.

1194
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:13,596
Might wanting to buy something.

1195
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,139
What would you want with it?

1196
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,058
I'm a peddler, ain't I?

1197
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:21,978
Oh, hi! (BABBLING)

1198
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:25,440
What a beautiful hot-water bag.
Looks French.

1199
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:27,025
It must have cost you plenty.

1200
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:29,319
- I give you eight dollar for it.
- Eight dollars?

1201
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,822
- That wouldn't be honest. I only paid 3.50...
- All right.

1202
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:33,990
I said I give you eight. I will.

1203
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:39,322
- Oh, that's a crackerjack.
- Take your hands off that.

1204
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,665
That was for our wedding night.

1205
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:44,334
It don't fit you so good.
I give you $22.

1206
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:47,003
- Well, what...
- All right, 22.50. Not a cent more.

1207
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:49,005
(HUMMING)

1208
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:53,844
Oh, mighty dainty.
Fifteen dollar. Let's see now.

1209
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,513
Twenty-two and eight is 30,

1210
01:38:56,514 --> 01:39:01,685
and 15 is 45, and 50 is 45.50.

1211
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:02,933
Forty-five fifty.

1212
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:06,853
Say, that's almost...

1213
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:09,565
- You wanna buy some more?
- Might.

1214
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:11,653
You ever see one of these things?

1215
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:13,196
- How much you give me for this here thing?
- Oh, no.

1216
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:15,907
- I don't handle things like that.
- It's just a girl in a pink...

1217
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:18,201
- No, it's more than that.
- Hey.

1218
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:19,911
Either of you two see'd Laurey?

1219
01:39:19,912 --> 01:39:21,872
Up to the house, lookin' for Curly.

1220
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:23,540
- How much you give me for this thing?
- I tell you, I don't...

1221
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:24,833
What do you want for it?

1222
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:29,546
Well, let's see.

1223
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:33,422
- Three dollars and fifty cents.
- Sold.

1224
01:39:41,225 --> 01:39:46,397
Now, 3.50 from him, 45.50 from you.

1225
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:48,064
That makes $50, don't it?

1226
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:50,233
No. One dollar short.

1227
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:52,903
Oh, darn it.
I must have figured wrong.

1228
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:55,238
Well, how much for the rest of
the stuff in this here bag?

1229
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,574
- One dollar.
- Done.

1230
01:39:57,575 --> 01:39:59,576
Now I got the $50, ain't I?

1231
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:01,328
Know what that means?

1232
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:03,371
Means I'm gonna take
Ado Annie back from you.

1233
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:06,750
- You wouldn't do a thing like that to me.
- Wouldn't I?

1234
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:09,503
When I tell Ado Annie's pa who I
got most of the money off of,

1235
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,129
(LAUGHS)
maybe he'll change his mind

1236
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,839
about who's smart and who's dumb.

1237
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:17,637
Say, young fella,
you certainly buncoed me.

1238
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,048
(HUMMING)

1239
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:22,682
Oh. Ah.

1240
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:24,601
(HUMMING)

1241
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:28,939
Now here's the last two hampers.

1242
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:31,274
Whose they are, I ain't got no idy.

1243
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:34,277
The big one's mine, and the
next one to it is Laurey's.

1244
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,321
(LAUGHTER)

1245
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:38,448
That's the end of that secret.

1246
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:41,323
Now, what am I bid
for Annie's hamper?

1247
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:43,578
MAN: Two bits.

1248
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:47,791
- MAN #2: Four.
- Who says six? You?

1249
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:50,502
- Ain't nobody hungry no more?
- (LAUGHTER)

1250
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:53,047
What about you,
peddler-man? Six bits?

1251
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:55,590
No, no. I don't care.

1252
01:40:55,591 --> 01:40:57,676
- Bid 'em up.
- Six bits!

1253
01:40:57,677 --> 01:41:01,137
Oh, six bits ain't enough for
a lunch like Annie can make.

1254
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:04,342
Let's hear a dollar. How about you?
You won her last year.

1255
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:07,978
Hey, Annie, you still got the same
sweet potato pie like last year?

1256
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,604
You bet!

1257
01:41:09,605 --> 01:41:12,732
Same old sweet potato pie.
What do you say?

1258
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:15,277
I say it gimme
a three-day bellyache.

1259
01:41:15,278 --> 01:41:17,776
(LAUGHTER)

1260
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:21,151
Never mind about that.
Who bids a dollar?

1261
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:22,659
Come on, bid.

1262
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,995
Mine was the last bid.
I got her for six bits.

1263
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,664
- Bid a dollar.
- Ninety cents.

1264
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:30,333
Ninety cents. We're gettin' rich.

1265
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:33,037
Another desk for the schoolhouse.
Do I hear more?

1266
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:35,543
You hear $50.

1267
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:37,424
- Fifty dollars!
- Hey!

1268
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:40,343
Nobody ever bid $50 for a lunch.

1269
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:42,345
Nobody ever bid 10.

1270
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:44,848
- He ain't got $50.
- Oh, yes, I have.

1271
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:48,018
If you're a man of honor, you'll say Annie
belong to me like you said she would.

1272
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:49,894
- Where's your money?
- Right here in my hand.

1273
01:41:49,895 --> 01:41:53,019
That ain't yours. You just bid it,
didn't you? Give it to the schoolhouse.

1274
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:56,394
I still say the peddler
gets my daughter's hand.

1275
01:41:56,736 --> 01:41:59,863
- Now, wait a minute! That ain't fair!
- Going for $50.

1276
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:02,032
- Going, going...
- Fifty-one.

1277
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:05,077
- You crazy?
- Fifty...

1278
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:09,205
Wait a minute. Hold on.

1279
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:11,207
Aunt Eller,
if'n I don't bid no more,

1280
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,378
- I can keep my money, can't I?
- You sure can.

1281
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:17,714
Then I still got $50,
and this is mine.

1282
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:20,383
- You simple-minded shag poke.
- Going, going,

1283
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:24,554
gone for $51, and that means
Annie'll get the prize, I guess.

1284
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:27,008
- Oh! Oh!
- And I'll get Annie, I guess.

1285
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:29,886
And what are you
getting for your $51?

1286
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:33,272
- A three-day bellyache.
- (LAUGHTER)

1287
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:37,734

1291
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:47,744

Four seventy-five.

Come on, gentlemen.
Schoolhouse ain't built yet.

1310
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:47,846
Got to get a nice "chimbley."

Too rich for my blood.
Can't afford no more.

Five and a quarter.

1315

Ain't got nearly enough yet.

01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:02,152
Not for cold duck and stuffing,

- Six dollars.

- Six dollars!
- And two bits. And two bits.

My, you're stubborn, Jud.

1320
01:44:11,162 --> 01:44:13,663
Mr. Carnes is a richer man than you

- Oh, let it go.
- Anybody gonna bid any more?

No, they all dropped out.
Can't you see?

- You got enough, Aunt Eller.
- MAN: Yeah, let's get on.

- I got the money.
- Hold on, you.

enough, do you, Aunt Eller?

01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:56,331
More than you got.

01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:00,536
Got a saddle here. Cost me $30.

You can't bid saddles.
You gotta bid cash.

Thirty-dollar saddle must be
worth something to somebody.

- Right in my pocket.

01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:47,090
Sold.

1351
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:50,093
Aunt Eller, that makes the bid 35.

1352
01:45:50,094 --> 01:45:52,262
Curly, you're crazy.

1353
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:54,514
But it's all for the
schoolhouse, ain't it?

1354
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:56,599
- Going for 35...
- Hold on. Hold on now.

1355
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,302
I'm not finished bidding yet.

1356
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,894
You just sold everything you
got in the world, didn't you?

1357
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:05,875
You can't sell your clothes
'cause they ain't worth nothin'.

1358
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,278
You can't sell your gun
'cause you're gonna need it.

1359
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:10,652
Yes, sir, you're gonna need it bad.

1360
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:14,227
Well, I'm just as good as
Curly at gettin' what I want.

1361
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,321
I'm gonna bid everything
I got in the world.

1362
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:20,824
Forty-two dollars and 31 cents.

(CROWD GASPS)

1364
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:28,674
Anybody want to buy a gun?

1365
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:34,137
I bought it brand-new last
Thanksgiving. It's worth a lot.

1366
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:36,306
- Curly...
- MAN: Give you 18 for it, Curly.

1367
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:38,892
Sold.

1368
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:43,939
Aunt Eller, that makes the bid $53.

1369
01:46:44,607 --> 01:46:45,808
anybody going any higher?

1370
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:47,525
Sold!

1371
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:48,985
(LAUGHTER)

1372
01:46:48,986 --> 01:46:51,188
Going, going, gone.

1373
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,156
Well, what's the matter
with you folks?

1374
01:46:53,157 --> 01:46:55,158
Ain't nobody gonna
cheer or nothin'?

1375
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:57,157
(CHEERING)

1376
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,293
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Now, come on, you two.

1377
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:10,958
Shake hands.

1378
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,385
That's better.

1379
01:47:24,188 --> 01:47:25,810
- Curly?
- What?

1380
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,104
Can I show you something?

1381
01:47:29,526 --> 01:47:30,727
Excuse us, Laurey?

1382
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:40,575
You ever seen one of these?

1383
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:44,916
Just what is it?

1384
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:46,334
It's something special.

1385
01:47:47,753 --> 01:47:49,751
(INAUDIBLE)

1386
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:53,097
You just put it up to your eye and
you look through it, like that.

1387
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:58,554
Curly! Curly!

1388
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:01,015
- What you doing?
- Nothin'.

1389
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:03,226
What do you want to squeal
at a man like that for?

1390
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,894
You scared the livin' lights
out of me.

1391
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:07,730
Well, then stop lookin'
at them old French pictures.

1392
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:10,566
And ask me for a dance. You brung
me to the party, didn't you?

1393
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:14,195
All right, all right, you silly old
woman. I'll dance with you.

1394
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:18,074
Sam, pick that banjo to pieces.

(BAND PLAYS)

1396
01:48:37,636 --> 01:48:40,763
Now that I got that $50,
you name the day.

1397
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:44,100
- August 15.
- Why August 15?

1398
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:46,769
'Cause that was the
first day I was kissed.

1399
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:49,105
Was it? I didn't remember that.

1400
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:50,523
You wasn't there.

1401
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:53,943
Now, lookee here. We gotta
have a serious talk.

1402
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:56,779
Now that you're engaged to me,
you gotta stop havin' fun.

1403
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,152
I mean, with other fellas.

1404
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:03,286
You'll have to be
a little more standoffish

1405
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:07,415
When fellers offer you a buggy ride

1406
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:10,960
I'll give a imitation of a crawfish

1407
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:14,964
And dig myself a hole
where I can hide

1408
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:18,760
I heared how you was
kickin' up some capers

1409
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:21,345
When I was off in Kansas City, Mo

1410
01:49:21,346 --> 01:49:22,597
No!

1411
01:49:22,598 --> 01:49:26,350
I heared some things
you couldn't print in papers

1412
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:28,978
From fellers who been
talkin' like they know

1413
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:30,188
Foot!

1414
01:49:30,189 --> 01:49:33,858
I only did the kind of things I oughta
Sorta

1415
01:49:33,859 --> 01:49:37,695
To you I was as faithful as can be
For me

1416
01:49:37,696 --> 01:49:40,490
Them stories 'bout the way
I lost my bloomers

1417
01:49:40,491 --> 01:49:41,657
Rumors

1418
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:45,578
A lot of tempest in a pot of tea

1419
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:48,081
The whole thing don't
sound very good to me

1420
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:49,207
Well, you see...

1421
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:51,209
I go and sow my last wild oat

1422
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:53,211
I cut out all shenanigans

1423
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:55,046
I save my money
don't gamble or drink

1424
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:56,964
In a back room down at Flannigan's

1425
01:49:56,965 --> 01:49:58,966
I give up lots of other things

1426
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:00,593
That a gentleman never mentions

1427
01:50:00,594 --> 01:50:04,219
Before I give up any more
I wanna know your intentions

1428
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:15,358
With me it's all or nothin'

1429
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:20,655
Is it all or nothin' with you

1430
01:50:20,656 --> 01:50:23,199
It can't be in between

1431
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:25,868
It can't be now and then

1432
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:31,040
No half-and-half romance will do

1433
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:34,168
I'm a one-woman man
home-lovin' type

1434
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:36,712
All complete with slippers and pipe

1435
01:50:36,713 --> 01:50:41,300
Take me like I am or leave me be

1436
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:46,222
If you can't give me all
give me nothin'

1437
01:50:46,223 --> 01:50:49,559
And nothin's what
you'll get from me

01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,853
Not even somethin'

1439
01:50:51,854 --> 01:50:56,776
Nothing's what you'll get from me

1440
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:11,247
- It can't be in between
- Uh-uh.

1441
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:13,583
It can't be now and then

1442
01:51:13,584 --> 01:51:18,588
No half-and-half romance will do

1443
01:51:18,589 --> 01:51:21,424
Would you build me a
house all painted white

1444
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:24,093
Cute and clean and
pretty and bright

1445
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:28,598
Big enough for two
but not for three

1446
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:33,269
Supposing that we
should have a third one

1447
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:36,772
He better look a lot like me

1448
01:51:36,773 --> 01:51:38,774
The spittin' image

1449
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:44,152
He better look a lot like me

1450
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:34,997
With you it's all or nothin'

1451
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:40,503
All for you and nothin' for me

1452
01:52:40,504 --> 01:52:43,172
But if a wife is wise

1453
01:52:43,173 --> 01:52:45,675
She's gotta realize

1454
01:52:45,676 --> 01:52:51,180
That men like you are wild and free

1455
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:54,100
So I ain't gonna fuss
ain't gonna frown

1456
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:56,686
Have your fun
Go out on the town

1457
01:52:56,687 --> 01:53:01,440
Stay up late and don't
come home till 3:00

1458
01:53:01,441 --> 01:53:07,196
And go right off to sleep
if you're sleepy

1459
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:10,199
No use waitin' up for me

1460
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,410
Aw, Ado Annie

1461
01:53:12,411 --> 01:53:15,621
No use waitin' up for me

1462
01:53:15,622 --> 01:53:17,790
Come on and kiss me

1463
01:53:37,436 --> 01:53:41,482
(CHATTERING, LAUGHING)

1464
01:53:58,165 --> 01:54:00,166
Why'd you drive off
and leave me like that?

1465
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:03,127
Like I said, didn't want
to be late for the party.

1466
01:54:03,128 --> 01:54:05,796
You didn't want to be with me, you mean,
not a minute more than you had to.

1467
01:54:05,797 --> 01:54:08,007
I ain't good enough for you, am I?

1468
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:09,884
I'm a hired hand.

1469
01:54:09,885 --> 01:54:13,095
I got dirt on my hands. Pig slime.

1470
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:16,432
I ain't fit to touch, am I? You're better.
Oh, you're so much better.

1471
01:54:16,433 --> 01:54:18,434
Well, we'll see how much
better you are, Miss Laurey,

1472
01:54:18,435 --> 01:54:21,103
and you won't be so free and easy
and highfalutin with your airs.

1473
01:54:21,104 --> 01:54:24,315
- You such a fine lady!
- Are you makin' threats to me?

1474
01:54:24,316 --> 01:54:27,109
Are you trying to tell me if I don't
allow you to slobber over me like a hog,

1475
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,111
why, you're gonna do
something about it?

1476
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:31,113
Well, you ain't
a hired hand for me no more.

1477
01:54:31,114 --> 01:54:32,782
You can just pack up
your duds and scoot.

1478
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:35,284
Don't you as much as set foot
inside the pasture gate,

1479
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:37,112
or I'll sic the dogs on to you!

1480
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:41,449
You said your say.

1481
01:54:42,793 --> 01:54:44,495
You brought it on yourself.

1482
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:47,088
I can't help it.

1483
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:49,416
I can't never rest.

1484
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:55,882
I told you how it was.
You wouldn't listen.

1485
01:54:56,473 --> 01:54:59,768
You ain't never
gonna get rid of me. Never.

1486
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:10,945
Hey, Laurey, have you seen Annie?

1487
01:55:10,946 --> 01:55:15,074
- She's gone again.
- Will, will you do something for me?

1488
01:55:15,075 --> 01:55:17,410
Will you find Curly
and tell him I'm here?

1489
01:55:17,411 --> 01:55:20,121
I wanna see Curly awful bad.
I gotta see him.

1490
01:55:20,122 --> 01:55:22,495
Why don't you turn around
and look, you crazy woman?

1491
01:55:23,667 --> 01:55:24,868
Oh, Curly! (CRYING)

1492
01:55:26,211 --> 01:55:28,212
Well, you found yours.

1493
01:55:28,213 --> 01:55:29,881
I'm still lookin' for mine.

1494
01:55:30,507 --> 01:55:33,300
What on earth is ailing
the belle of Claremore?

1495
01:55:33,301 --> 01:55:35,302
Well, by gum, if you ain't cryin'.

1496
01:55:35,303 --> 01:55:38,389
Oh, Curly, I'm afraid,
afraid for my life.

1497
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:41,684
- Jumpin' toadstools.
- Don't you leave me!

1498
01:55:41,685 --> 01:55:45,354
- Gosh a-mighty.
- Don't mind me cryin'.

1499
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:48,399
I can't help it.

1500
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,979
- You can cry your eyes out.
- I don't know what to do.

1501
01:55:52,988 --> 01:55:56,317
Well, here. I'll show ya.

1502
01:56:13,508 --> 01:56:17,094
That's about all a man can stand in
public. You go away from me, you.

1503
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:19,263
Oh. You don't like me, Curly?

1504
01:56:19,264 --> 01:56:22,684
Like you? You get away from me,
I tell ya. Plumb away from me.

1505
01:56:24,352 --> 01:56:26,395
Curly, you're sittin' on the stove!

1506
01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:28,064
(SHOUTS)

1507
01:56:29,649 --> 01:56:31,692
It's cold as a hunk of ice.

1508
01:56:31,693 --> 01:56:34,236
Wished it had burned
a hole in your pants.

1509
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:36,238
- You do, do ya?
- You heared me.

1510
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:40,740
Now, look, Laurey, you stand
right there where you at

1511
01:56:41,536 --> 01:56:42,988
and I'll sit right over here.

1512
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:49,753
Now, you can tell me
what you wanted with me.

1513
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:54,924
Well, Jud was here.

1514
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:56,926
He scared me.

1515
01:56:56,927 --> 01:57:01,263
He talked wild, and he threatened
