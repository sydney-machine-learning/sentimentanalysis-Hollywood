1
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,209
Hey, lady, what kind of tattoo
did you get on you?

2
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,511
- I got a rose tattoo.
- Where did you get it, lady?

3
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,315
- Where did he put it on you?
- Right over my heart, little boy.

4
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,732
64 Front Street, lady.

5
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,172
Wait here.

6
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,605
- Little girl.
- Yes?

7
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,209
- You're a twig off the old rosebush.
- What?

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,611
Is the lady that does
the sewing in the house?

9
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,753
Nobody's here but Daddy and me.

10
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,285
And Daddy's asleep.

11
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,855
Do you mind if I wait on the porch
till she gets back?

12
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,286
She won't be long.

13
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,017
Where is your mama?

14
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,287
Ideal Grocery Store.

15
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,765
Look, she buys Grade A.
I buy Grade B.

16
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,561
- Now, which is which?
- Oh, yeah.

17
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,204
Don't mix up those eggs.

18
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,465
What difference is it?
Which is it?

19
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,937
I'll tell you the difference.

20
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,543
I got a Grade A husband,
that's the difference.

21
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,839
Oh, then I got a Grade B husband?

22
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,811
I don't know which grade
is your husband.

23
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,111
I got a Grade A husband,
and I know the difference.

24
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,515
Yeah, I know the difference,

25
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:13,123
and I don't give a Grade A husband
a Grade B egg for his breakfast.

26
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,657
- OK?
- Package. Your package, lady.

27
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,887
Where is somebody, please, to carry
this package for me on the street?

28
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,394
My husband don't allow me

29
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,827
- to carry big packages...
- Next.

30
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,559
- Like a horse on the street. Please!
- Next.

31
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,601
Oh, my.

32
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,734
OK.

33
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,208
Thank you, huh?

34
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,940
- Buon giorno, Serafina.
- Buon giorno, Padre.

35
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,584
You are dressed for a party?

36
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,777
No, I am dressed
for a big celebration.

37
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,218
I got some wonderful news
to give my husband.

38
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,652
Oh? What news?

39
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,326
I got to tell this news
to my husband first.

40
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,496
I'm sorry, Father. Goodbye.

41
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,028
Goodbye.

42
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,626
Oh, my.

43
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,831
Mama.

44
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,671
- Is Papa home, cara?
- Yes, he's here.

45
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,504
A lady's waiting for you
on the porch, Mama.

46
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,941
- Lady?
- Yes.

47
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,444
- Open the door for me.
- All right.

48
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,048
Ale!

49
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,242
Oh, please.

50
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,319
Let me see. Let me see!

51
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,822
Let me see.

52
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,259
Such a perfume.

53
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,027
- My! Where is Papa?
- In the bedroom, sleeping.

54
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,462
- Sleeping?
- Yes.

55
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,137
Why don't you tell me he was
sleeping before I slam the door?

56
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,307
- Scimmia.
- He has to make a night run, Mama.

57
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,736
Don't make any noise.

58
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,400
Amore.

59
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,568
Come sai di buono.

60
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,142
I like the smell of rose oil
in your hair.

61
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,522
Good.

62
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,321
Good.

63
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,517
Oh, love, tonight is a feast, you know.

64
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,196
Because I have been to the doctor.

65
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,259
I have a new life in my body.

66
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,326
Yeah.

67
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,198
I have a new life in my body.

68
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,135
It's true. It's true.

69
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,675
Oh, love, stay with me tonight.

70
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,675
Don't go, please.

71
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,714
I don't understand these strange
night runs that you make.

72
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,887
I don't understand. I don't like it.

73
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,680
I don't like it.

74
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,153
Stay with me, please.

75
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,420
This... This night run
is the last that you make.

76
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,760
Is the last. You hear me?

77
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,026
You hear me, darling?

78
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,898
You... You promise me, darling.

79
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,940
- Si, last run. Si.
- OK.

80
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,646
OK, thank you. OK.

81
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,442
Mama? The lady says she can't wait.

82
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,345
Yeah. Vengo.

83
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,984
Rest, love. Rest.

84
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,918
I come back right away. Right away.

85
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,345
- Hello.
- Hello.

86
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,280
- Do you want something?
- I heard you do sewing.

87
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,512
Talk soft, please. My husband
is sleeping in there.

88
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,213
What do you want sewed?

89
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,052
How fast can you make
a shirt for me?

90
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,659
Oh, that depends.

91
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,955
I have some silk with me
I want made into a shirt.

92
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,632
- There.
- Wonderful.

93
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,234
Look at that colore.
Rosa, huh?

94
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,701
Wonderful stuff
for a blouse, pajamas.

95
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,136
Oh, I want a man's shirt
made out of it.

96
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,640
Silk this color for a...?
For a shirt for a man?

97
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,739
Well, this man's wild like a Gypsy.
He likes to feel

98
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,348
silk on his skin and wants
everything rose-colored.

99
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,511
A woman should not encourage
a man to be wild. Never.

100
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,485
If a man's wild, he's hard
for a woman to hold.

101
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,659
But if he's tame, would a woman
want to hold him?

102
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,956
I told you soft, please.
My husband's sleeping.

103
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,755
Oh, I'm sorry.

104
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,523
I'm a married woman in business.

105
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:53,330
I don't know nothing about wild men
and wild women. I'm sorry.

106
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,268
I'll give you twice
what you ask me for it.

107
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,773
Money isn't the object,
but it has to be ready tomorrow.

108
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,070
- Tomorrow? Oh, it's impossible.
- Twenty dollars!

109
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,042
- Impossible.
- But it has to be ready tomorrow.

110
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,341
Because tomorrow's the anniversary
of the day we met,

111
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,745
me and this man I love.

112
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,979
I want him to wear this shirt
in honor of the occasion.

113
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,481
I have his measurements
right here with me.

114
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,689
Mama! The black goat
is loose in the yard!

115
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,421
- The black goat is loose in the yard!
- Keep him out of the yard.

116
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,430
Stop shouting. Let Papa sleep.

117
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,204
Pin the measurements,
your name on the silk,

118
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,237
and the shirt will be ready
tomorrow. I'm sorry.

119
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,910
My name's Estelle Hohengarten.

120
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,106
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

121
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,414
Catch him! My tomat...
Oh, my!

122
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,255
- The goat is loose.
- The goat's loose! The goat's loose!

123
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,019
Hey! Come back here!

124
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,321
- Mardi Gras Club.
- Rosa! Rosa!

125
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,599
You go in the house!
Don't look at the strega.

126
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,773
- Why do you call her a witch?
- She has the evil eye.

127
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,407
- Go in the house.
- She has a cataract.

128
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,509
On strillare.
She shook hands with the devil.

129
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,906
She did not shake hands with the devil.
She has rheumatism.

130
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,708
Malocchio. On strillare.
Go in the house.

131
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,511
And wash your face with saltwater,
and throw the saltwater away.

132
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,947
Go in the house!

133
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,419
Go in, quick! She's coming.

134
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,421
Malocchio.

135
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,666
Rosario.

136
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,412
Mama...

137
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,049
...why did Papa run away like that?

138
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,186
I don't know, Rosa.

139
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,994
Car 61 calling Car 62.
Come in, please.

140
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,670
Car 62, come in.

141
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:10,035
Be on the lookout. Five-ton truck
with brown canvas cover.

142
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,439
Left the Mardi Gras Club
ten minutes ago.

143
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,908
The Baron of Roses
picked up his load

144
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,549
at the Mardi Gras Club
ten minutes ago.

145
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,612
Check with Micky at the Four-Mile
Bridge and see if...

146
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,256
Standby. I think he's coming now.

147
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,292
- He made his last night run.
- Yeah.

148
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,560
He should've stuck
to hauling bananas.

149
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,712
Who's gonna tell her, Father?

150
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,757
I think a woman should.

151
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,733
I hear the sewing machine.
She's working.

152
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,898
She's holding up a piece
of rose-colored silk.

153
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,010
I think Assunta should tell her.

154
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,376
I think she already knows
what we have come to tell her.

155
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,324
- Something is wrong.
- What? What did you hear?

156
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,665
Come, ladies, we must go inside.

157
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,158
Don't speak.

158
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,208
Don't speak.

159
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,979
Don't speak. Don't speak.

160
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,277
Don't speak.

161
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,043
Don't speak.

162
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,982
Don't speak. Please don't.

163
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,589
Don't speak. Please don't.

164
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,383
Don't speak.

165
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,083
Don't speak.

166
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,820
Don't speak, please. Don't speak.

167
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,522
Don't speak. Don't speak.

168
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,969
She's lost the baby.

169
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,633
But Serafina's a strong woman.

170
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,969
She's going to pull
through this all right.

171
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,576
But she's trying not to breathe.

172
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,145
So she's got to be watched
and not allowed out of bed.

173
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,077
- You know how to give injections?
- Yes.

174
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,581
Needle. I use.

175
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,615
- I know how.
- Oh, fine. I'll get you some stuff.

176
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,723
Doctor, I wanted to talk to you.

177
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,224
The... The body.

178
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,989
The body of the man
must not be burned.

179
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,992
Rosario's body was burned
when the truck was burned.

180
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,601
Deliberate cremation
is not the same thing.

181
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,203
She wants the body cremated

182
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,737
so she can keep the man's
ashes in the house.

183
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,603
Well, if keeping the ashes in the house
will be any comfort to her...

184
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,780
But the body is dead.
The body must be buried.

185
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,039
Just a moment.

186
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,410
Father.

187
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,053
Where's the body?

188
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,617
Who are you?

189
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,852
Who are you? Please, who are you?

190
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,088
- Estelle Hohengarten.
- You cannot go in there.

191
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,698
See him, I have to.

192
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,630
- The body cannot be seen.
- I have to see him.

193
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,633
- You must go away, please.
- I've gotta see him.

194
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,068
- Please, you cannot go in there.
- I've got to.

195
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,242
- I've gotta see him.
- No, the body cannot be seen.

196
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,410
- I've gotta see him.
- But you must go away, please.

197
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,873
The widow knows nothing about you.

198
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,013
- Assassina!
- Vigliacca!

199
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,807
Sporcacciona!

200
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,729
Somebody stop the piano!

201
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,040
Stop it!

202
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,308
Stop it. Ferma!

203
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,945
Ferma.

204
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,438
Go home.

205
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,803
My father is dead.

206
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,187
Rosa, you're not going
to have any fun at the dance

207
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,258
unless you just forget
all about your dress.

208
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,895
Mama made five formals
for other girls.

209
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,496
She wouldn't make one for me.

210
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,256
She said if my Daddy was living

211
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,298
he wouldn't allow me to go
to a high-school dance.

212
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,130
But your father's been dead
three years. You're grown up now.

213
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,829
Rosa, you stop crying, or I won't
go another step with you.

214
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,941
I'm the only girl without a formal.

215
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,543
Wait. Just a minute.
I wanna fix your face.

216
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,213
Lutie, this is Jack Hunter.

217
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,472
- Hello.
- How do you do?

218
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,547
Who is that boy with Pauline Hunter?

219
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,979
That's her brother, Jack.

220
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,585
I think he's a dream of a dream.

221
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:06,815
- Girls, this is Art Noble and Ray Brinn.
- Hi.

222
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,654
- Good evening, Rosa and Violetta.
- Hello.

223
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,592
Jack, I'd like you to meet
Rosa Delle...

224
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,358
Why did Rosa run away like that?

225
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,058
She's all upset because
she's not wearing a formal.

226
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,670
Well, it's not important.
Not all girls have formals.

227
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,431
Excuse me.

228
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:40,254
La tua voca gentile

229
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:48,628
Piu non allieta il mio core

230
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:55,501
Come le rose d'Aprile

231
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:59,666
Le gioie d'amore...

232
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,402
Rose?

233
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,113
How do you know my name?

234
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,113
What other name could it be?

235
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,518
I'm not disappointed.
Honest, I'm not.

236
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,096
Well, I'm disappointed, sure, but...

237
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,197
What I mean is, I...

238
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,128
I respect you for it.

239
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,336
Actually, I did want to let you kiss me.

240
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,103
You know something?

241
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,974
We're locked in this place.

242
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,547
Locked?

243
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,509
Mama will kill me.

244
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,066
Hey, back there, did you
really want to let me?

245
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,637
I was scared to, though.

246
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,172
- My heart was beating so fast...
- You don't need to explain.

247
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,674
- Maybe next time I...
- When? When?

248
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,743
Is tomorrow OK?

249
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,974
Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow is OK, OK, OK.

250
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,052
Then tomorrow, I'll let you kiss me.

251
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,927
Civics, you study civics...

252
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,130
...till a quarter past one?

253
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,361
Yes, I study civics.

254
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,063
Civics is very important,
and tomorrow's the final.

255
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,764
Oh, I know.

256
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,668
I'm very tired, Mama.

257
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,574
Help me unfold the sofa, will you?

258
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,807
Come here, Rosa.
Come on.

259
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,446
Kneel to Our Lady and swear
to me you study civics.

260
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,882
No, I will not.

261
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,717
Because you don't study
no civics tonight.

262
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,688
"Don't study no civics."

263
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,591
Why do you talk like you just
came over in steerage?

264
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,198
This isn't Sicily, Mother,
and you are not a baroness.

265
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,927
You do sewing. Daddy...
Daddy hauled bananas.

266
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,836
He hauled bananas and something
under the banan...

267
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,282
You don't study no civics no more.

268
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,710
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm going to Serafina house.

269
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,684
Yesterday she don't
give me the dress.

270
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,516
She don't even open the door.

271
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,420
We break in and get them.

272
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,994
And to me, she said all week,
"Domani, domani."

273
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,028
But yesterday I told her, you know.
I says:

274
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,395
"Wait, Serafina, domani is
the high-school graduation,

275
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,730
"and I gotta have the dress,
because I gotta try it on my daughter."

276
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,669
Because my daughter got fat,
and she's gotta give it to me today.

277
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,740
Come on, let's go for the dresses.

278
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,047
- Giuseppina, go open the door.
- In just a minute.

279
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,519
Serafina!

280
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,212
Serafina Delle Rose!

281
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,294
Serafina, we want the dresses!

282
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,499
Rosa, take it off,
or I tear it to ribbons.

283
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,134
Mama, please.
I've got to go to school.

284
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,667
- It's the last day.
- Take it off.

285
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,305
- Let me at least go out for graduation.
- Take it off.

286
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,168
Now I'm mad! And she's gotta give me
the dress whether she wants to or not.

287
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,470
I'm going to give them their dresses.

288
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,148
You ain't running out!

289
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,577
OK?

290
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,911
Rosa! Rosa!

291
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,488
You know I don't understand Italian,
so please.

292
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,430
- Now, what's happening here?
- Shut up.

293
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,399
You know, we came here
for the dresses...

294
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,401
- She cut her wrist, my daughter!
- Good heavens!

295
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,235
Call the doctor, please, someone.
Call the doctor.

296
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,706
Come in!

297
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,438
Mrs. Delle Rose, your daughter
has not cut her wrist.

298
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,640
- No? What?
- Your daughter's all right.

299
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,785
And you ladies, please, go away.

300
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,317
We don't go without our dresses.

301
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,115
The graduation begins,
and the girls ain't dressed.

302
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,018
Rosa. Come here.
Show your mother

303
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,195
- that you're not bleeding to death.
- Let me see.

304
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,526
Leave me alone. I'm so ashamed
I could die. Yes, so ashamed.

305
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,861
This is the way she goes
around all the time.

306
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,503
She hasn't put dress on
since my father was killed.

307
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,764
For three years,
she never puts a dress on

308
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,908
or goes out of the house,
and now...

309
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,045
Now she has locked up
my clothes so I can't go out.

310
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,840
She wants me to be like her,
a freak of the neighborhood.

311
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,607
The way she is!

312
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,115
Next time I won't cut my wrist,
but my throat!

313
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,446
On parlare cosi!

314
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,817
Mrs. Delle Rose, please give me
the key to your daughter's clothes

315
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,584
so she can dress for the graduation.

316
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,294
Please, Serafina, give us
our dresses, will you, please?

317
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,229
Now, you ladies, please.
I wanna chat with Mrs. Delle Rose.

318
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,995
I know, I know.
Well, you just wait outside.

319
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,604
Thank you. Just a moment.

320
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:34,775
Now, Mrs. Delle Rose, your daughter
missed her final examinations.

321
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,006
But her grades have been so good
that she'll be allowed to graduate

322
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,151
with her class and take
the examinations later.

323
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,015
You understand me,
Mrs. Delle Rose?

324
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,557
You see? I got a wild thing
in the house.

325
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,489
Now, let's not have any more
outbursts of emotion.

326
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,185
What?

327
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,489
Outbur...?

328
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,393
You make me sick.

329
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,068
Sick at my stomach, you make me.

330
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,794
Your school.

331
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,832
You make all this trouble.

332
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,509
You give this dance
where she gets mixed up...

333
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,804
Where she gets mixed up
with a sailor. With a sailor.

334
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,574
You're talking about
Pauline Hunter's brother Jack,

335
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,774
who attended the dance
with his sister?

336
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,350
- Attended with sister?
- Yes.

337
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,749
What sister? My... My daughter,
she's nobody's sister.

338
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,687
Don't listen to her, Miss Yorke.
Don't pay any attention to her.

339
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,422
- Rosa...
- I'm ready to go now.

340
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,590
She's lovely.

341
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,497
Come kiss Mama, darling.
Stop now.

342
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,436
- Kiss mama once...
- Leave me alone.

343
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,338
Don't go like that! Please!

344
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,837
Don't you dare come out
looking like that!

345
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,243
Rosa! How high is this high school

346
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,111
where she gets mixed up
with a sailor?

347
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,810
How high is this high school?
I will show you.

348
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,251
It's high like that horse's dirt
on the street.

349
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,981
That's your high school!

350
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,557
Scuola maledetta!

351
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,921
- Scuola maledetta!
- Mrs. Delle Rose,

352
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,859
I don't understand how a woman
that acts like you

353
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,558
could have such a sweet and refined
young girl for a daughter.

354
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,600
Oh, my.

355
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,830
Do you want me to talk refined,
do you?

356
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,667
Then do me one thing, please.

357
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,845
Stop ruining the girls
at the high school!

358
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,242
- OK?
- Serafina, look at yourself.

359
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,679
All these ladies here,
and you are not dressed.

360
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,877
I'm dressed OK! I'm not naked!

361
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,120
I'm so ashamed I could die.
I'm so ashamed.

362
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,088
Mama, you look disgusting.

363
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,267
Yes, disgusting!

364
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,111
Disgusting.

365
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,045
Did you hear what...?

366
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,724
What my daughter say to me?

367
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,391
"You look disgusting."

368
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,896
She calls me disgusting.

369
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,498
Serafina, now we must
go in the house.

370
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,134
Come on. Come on.

371
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:24,541
How pretty she look, my daughter,
in a white dress, like a bride.

372
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,779
How pretty.

373
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,483
Go away, please.

374
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,628
Go away, please.

375
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,128
Did you hear what my daughter
called me?

376
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,963
She called me disgusting.

377
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,905
Disgusting.

378
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:09,256
There, Serafina. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

379
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,031
Disgusting.

380
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,551
Oh, the band.

381
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,860
I go to the high school.

382
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,525
I go to the high school.

383
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,039
Shut up, you.

384
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,557
I fail to understand why
we have to take a chance

385
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,493
missing the 12:00
just to pick up a blouse.

386
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,725
I told you this blouse can mean
the difference between a not-so-good

387
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,800
and a very good time
in New Orleans.

388
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,631
Wait till you see how sexy.

389
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,070
Where did I put the wristwatch?

390
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,277
Is my blouse ready, honey?

391
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,908
Oh, I'm late for the graduation
of my daughter.

392
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,379
- I can't find her graduation present.
- Well, I'm late, too.

393
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,814
- Come on, now. Where's the blouse?
- Blouse?

394
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,920
What blouse?

395
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,380
Oh, no ready.

396
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,059
I had to make 14 graduation
dresses. You know?

397
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,321
Well, now, a promise is a promise,
and an excuse is just an excuse, now.

398
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,692
Yeah, but I got to go
to the high school now.

399
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,596
Yeah, I know, but we gotta go
to the convention in New Orleans.

400
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,830
- Where is that wristwatch?
- Here. Here. Here it is.

401
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,802
Now, come on, woman.

402
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,001
Get started and sew them
bandanas together.

403
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,204
If you don't do it, I'm gonna report you
to the Chamber of Commerce

404
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,939
and have your license revoked.

405
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,515
What license you talking about?

406
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,151
I have no license.

407
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,581
You hear that, Flora?

408
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,221
- She don't have no license.
- No.

409
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,857
She's operating against the law
without no license?

410
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,822
Yeah.

411
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,086
I stitch them together, OK.

412
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,165
OK. OK.

413
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,936
OK.

414
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,237
Train's pulling out!

415
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,308
- You and your stinking blouse.
- Flora.

416
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,911
You know there's another one
at 12:45.

417
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,445
I fail to understand
why it's so important

418
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,674
for you to pick up
a polka-dot blouse.

419
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,978
- You make me sick.
- Come on, now, Flora. Sit down.

420
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,621
You're gonna wear your feet out
before we get to the city.

421
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,553
You let me worry about my own feet.

422
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,126
I heard that the convention delegates
caught a girl on Canal Street.

423
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,299
- Yeah?
- And they tore the clothes off her

424
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,592
and sent her home in a taxi!

425
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,878
I double-dog dare anybody
to try that on me.

426
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,307
You?

427
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,777
You'd walk home.

428
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,908
You two ladies,

429
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,677
watch how you talk in here.

430
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,446
This is a respectable house.

431
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,624
Oh, well...

432
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,622
...excuse me.

433
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,586
Polly want a cracker?

434
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,130
No, he don't want a cracker.
Polly, no.

435
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,461
There's some delegates
to the convention on the highway.

436
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,867
- No kidding?
- Yeah. Right there, see?

437
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,375
Yell something at them!

438
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,635
Mademoiselle from Armentieres

439
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,370
- Parlay-voo
- Parlay-voo

440
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,048
Mademoiselle from Armentieres
Parlay-voo

441
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,982
Mademoiselle from Armentieres
Hasn't been kissed in 40 years

442
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,889
Look at that one. Isn't he cute?

443
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,389
- Come on over here.
- Come on out.

444
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,060
I told you women.

445
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,994
You are not in a honky-tonk.

446
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,696
You. Take your blouse now
and get out.

447
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,570
Get out on the streets
where you belong.

448
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,643
This is the house
of Rosario Delle Rose,

449
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,246
and I won't have dirty talk in here.

450
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,484
- Who's talking dirty?
- Yeah, who is?

451
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,313
You. You are. You are.

452
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,955
Dirty talk.
All the time, "Men, men, men."

453
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,648
- You two man-crazy things, you.
- Sour grapes.

454
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,087
Sour grapes is your trouble.

455
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,693
You are just wild with envy.

456
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,887
Come on, Bessie, let's get
out of here. Forget the...

457
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:50,727
Now just wait a minute. I don't accept
insults from anybody. Hear?

458
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,962
Go on. Go on the street and pick up
a man on Canal Street,

459
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,006
but not in my house at my windows.

460
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,478
Here is the memory of my husband,
with a...

461
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,374
With a body like a young boy

462
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:07,176
and skin on him smooth and sweet
as a yellow rose petal.

463
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,377
I'm satisfied to remember,
because I had the best,

464
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,955
and not the second best,
but the only best, a rose.

465
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,353
- A rose, was he?
- A rose, a rose.

466
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,461
Yeah, a rose of an Italian
that got shot

467
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,494
smuggling stuff under a load
of bananas.

468
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:24,566
Get out. Get out! I'm satisfied
to remember the love of a man

469
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:29,001
that was mine, only mine.
Never touched by nobody.

470
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,505
Nobody but me. Just me.

471
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,770
- Never touched by nobody?
- Nobody. Nobody but me.

472
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,143
Well, I know somebody
that could a tale unfold.

473
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,114
And not no further
than the Mardi Gras Club is.

474
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,619
Estelle Hohengarten,
the blackjack dealer from Texas.

475
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,087
Bessie, get into your blouse,
and let's get out of here.

476
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,159
Well, everybody knows.
All come out at the inquest.

477
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,126
Serafina was laying there in bed
with her eyes shut tight

478
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:58,325
and the sheet pulled over her head
like a... Like a female ostrich.

479
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,801
Tie this blasted thing on me,
will you?

480
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:05,472
It was a romance too.
Not no fly-by-night thing,

481
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,577
but a real steady affair
that went on for more than a year.

482
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,047
Oh, leave her in ignorance.
Ignorance is bliss.

483
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,413
He had a rose tattoo on his chest,
the stuck-up thing.

484
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,521
Estelle was so gone on him that
she went down to Bourbon Street

485
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,191
and had one put on her too.

486
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:27,022
Yeah, a rose tattoo on her chest,
same as the macaroni's.

487
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,727
- Liar! Liar!
- Bessie, let's go.

488
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,925
- Let's get out of here.
- Let her howl her head off.

489
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,831
You don't know what you're saying!

490
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:37,474
- You don't understand! Liar!
- A rose tattoo on her chest!

491
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,937
- Police!
- Liar!

492
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,278
- Get out!
- Murder! Police!

493
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,677
- Get out!
- Sour grapes! That's your problem.

494
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,612
- Sour grapes!
- Help! Murder! Police!

495
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,253
I'm gonna have her arrested.
I'm gonna call the police.

496
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,980
I'm gonna have you arrested,
hear?

497
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,818
- Oh, leave. Let's go.
- Have me arrested.

498
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,621
You and your yellow rose petals.

499
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,627
- Sour grapes!
- Have me arrested.

500
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,392
Sour grapes!

501
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,380
Rosario, give me a sign.

502
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,512
Tell me is not true.

503
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,511
Rosario, tell me is not true.

504
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,521
Tell me is not true.

505
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,357
Lady, give me a sign.
Tell me is not true.

506
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,629
It's my money.
I can spend it how I like.

507
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,534
Well, pretend you didn't
buy them for me.

508
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,867
Tell Mama they're for her.

509
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,439
You're sure dying for me to make
a good impression on her, aren't you?

510
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,047
She's got the wrong idea about you,
that's why.

511
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,684
Now, say the roses are for her.

512
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,351
Please, Jack.

513
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,219
Mama must have gone out.

514
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:09,063
There is a key in the mailbox.

515
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,644
- How do you know she's out?
- The door was locked.

516
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,411
And all the shutters are closed.

517
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,547
Put down the flowers.

518
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,858
Come here.

519
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,331
I want to teach you a little Italian word.

520
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:56,006
- The word is bacio.
- Bacio? What's it mean?

521
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,344
This.

522
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,180
And this.

523
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,753
Just think.

524
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,224
A week ago Friday
I didn't know boys existed.

525
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,656
Did you know girls existed
before the dance?

526
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,924
I knew they existed.

527
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,001
Do you remember what you said
to me on the dance floor?

528
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,729
"Honey, you are dancing too close."

529
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,172
Well, it was hot in the gym,
and the floor was crowded.

530
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,939
When my girlfriend was teaching
me how to dance, I asked her,

531
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:35,482
"How do you know which way
the boy is going to move?"

532
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,879
And she said,

533
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,718
"You've got to feel how the boy's
going to move with your body."

534
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,392
I said,

535
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,687
"How do you feel
with your body?"

536
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,563
And she said,
"By pressing up close."

537
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,635
That's why I pressed up close.

538
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,637
I didn't realize that I was.

539
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,975
You're blushing.

540
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,279
Don't go away.

541
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,216
And a few minutes later
you said to me,

542
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,683
"Gee, you're beautiful."

543
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,288
I said, "Excuse me,"
and I ran to the ladies' room.

544
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,552
Do you know why?

545
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,993
To look at myself in the mirror.

546
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,792
For the first time in my life,

547
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,897
I felt I was beautiful.

548
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:32,371
You made me feel beautiful
when you said I was.

549
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,344
You are beautiful, Rosa.

550
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,013
So much, I...

551
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,547
Sta' zitta, cretina.

552
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,752
- I knew somebody was in here.
- Mama?

553
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:48,516
- Are you there, Mama?
- No, no. I'm not.

554
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,193
I'm dead and buried.

555
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:55,257
- Maybe I'd better go wait outside.
- No. No, you stay right here.

556
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,990
Mama...

557
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,736
...Jack is with me.

558
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,501
Are you dressed up nicely?

559
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,009
Why is it so dark in here?

560
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:12,114
Jack, open the shutters.
I want to introduce you to my mother.

561
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,880
- Hadn't I better go out...?
- No.

562
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,960
Mama, you said you were
dressed up pretty.

563
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,824
Jack, stay out for a minute, huh?

564
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,993
What's happened?
What's happened, Mama?

565
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,762
Look, put this on.

566
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:40,301
So... So... Here.

567
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,339
Here we are.

568
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,070
Good.

569
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,050
Let's fix your hair.

570
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,450
There you are.

571
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,144
Fine.

572
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,294
Jack?

573
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,595
Mama is ready to meet you.

574
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,767
Mama, su. Su, Mama.

575
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,605
Mama didn't sleep good last night.

576
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,977
Mama, this is Jack Hunter.

577
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,242
Hello, Mrs. Delle Rose.
It sure is a pleasure to meet you.

578
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,580
I was hoping to see you
at the graduation, Mrs. Delle Rose.

579
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:28,247
My sister was graduating.
My mother was there, and my father.

580
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,951
I... I was hoping you could
all get together.

581
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,597
Mama.

582
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:39,094
Jack... Jack brought you
some flowers.

583
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,906
I hope you are as partial
to roses as I am.

584
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,607
Mama.

585
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,402
Mama, say something.

586
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,205
Say something simple, like, "Thanks."

587
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,151
Thanks.

588
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,117
- I think your mama...
- No.

589
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:02,383
Oh, my diploma.
Yes, show Mama my diploma.

590
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,686
- Where is it?
- It's on the table there, near the piano.

591
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,419
Excuse me. I'll get it.

592
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,623
Mama. Mama, what's happened?
Can't you tell me, Mama?

593
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,202
Is it because of this morning?
Look, it's only a scratch.

594
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,032
Forget it, Mama.

595
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,267
Think it was just a bad dream
that never happened.

596
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,209
Here it is.

597
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:27,708
Look what I got, my diploma.
Father De Leo gave them out.

598
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,752
- Diploma?
- Si, right there.

599
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,981
You got the diploma?

600
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:40,457
Put it in the drawer,
with your father's clothes.

601
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,465
Mrs. Delle Rose, you should be very,
very proud of your daughter.

602
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,864
You know, Rosa was so pretty
when she walked on the stage

603
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,370
that people went:

604
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,098
Just like that.
Do you know what I mean?

605
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,038
They all went:

606
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:58,508
Because your daughter, Rosa,
was so lovely-looking.

607
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:03,242
How does it feel to be the mother
of the prettiest girl in the world?

608
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,419
Would you mind shutting up? Pazza.

609
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,827
Shut the front door, please.

610
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,691
There was a policeman come here
because of some trouble.

611
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,232
Mama, I've never seen you like this.
What will Jack think?

612
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,960
What do I care what Jack thinks?

613
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:25,107
You wild, wild, crazy thing, you,

614
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,004
with the eyes of your father.

615
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:30,609
Yes, ma'am, you certainly got a right
to be very proud of your daughter.

616
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:35,018
I'm proud of the memory
of her father.

617
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,619
He was a baron.

618
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,387
And who are you?

619
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:48,826
- What are you?
- Mama, I just introduced him.

620
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,763
- His name is Jack Hunter.
- Hunter?

621
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,903
Yes, ma'am, Hunter. Jack Hunter.

622
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:58,540
- What are you hunting, Jack?
- Mama. Mama.

623
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,475
What all of them are hunting.

624
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,311
To have a good time,
and the devils cares who pays for it.

625
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,750
I'm sick of men,
and I'm sick of women.

626
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,789
You, Rosa, get out... till I talk
to this boy, huh?

627
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,759
- I didn't bring Jack here to be insulted.
- No, it's all right, honey. It's all right.

628
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,954
Go on, let your mama talk to me.

629
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,292
I think your mama's just got
a slight wrong impression.

630
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,966
I got a... I got an impression.

631
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,035
Well, I'll get dressed.

632
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,767
Mama... Mama, please don't
spoil it for me.

633
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,811
The happiest day of my life.

634
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,655
- Mrs. Delle Rose...
- Delle Rose.

635
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,051
- Mrs. Delle Rose...
- Delle Rose. OK.

636
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,523
I'm sorry about all this. Believe me,
the last thing I had in mind

637
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,993
was getting mixed up
in a family situation.

638
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,428
Look, I come home
after three months at sea.

639
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,194
My sister was going to a high-school
dance, and she took me with her.

640
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,995
And there I met your daughter.

641
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,301
- What did you do?
- At the dance?

642
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:07,443
- We danced.
- What did you do after that?

643
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,670
We went to a place and had
an ice-cream soda, chocolate.

644
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,983
You mean you haven't been
alone with my Rosa, huh?

645
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,244
Alone or not alone,
what's the point of that question?

646
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:20,218
- I still don't see the point of it.
- No.

647
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:23,390
I'll show you the point.
We are Sicilians.

648
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:27,052
We don't leave the girls with the boys
they are not engaged to.

649
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:30,126
Mrs. Delle Rose,
this is the United States.

650
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:35,101
I know, but we are Sicilians.
We are not cold-blooded.

651
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:38,138
My girl is innocent, pure.

652
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:43,306
She is, or she was.
I would like to know which.

653
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,982
Mrs. Delle Rose,
I gotta tell you something.

654
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,980
You may not believe it.
It's a hard thing to say.

655
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,379
Say it. Say it.

656
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,656
Well, maybe I'm a sailor and all that,

657
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,325
and the things they say about sailors...

658
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,928
But all of us...
I mean, a girl in every port and all.

659
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,930
- No?
- I haven't got a girl in every port.

660
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:07,160
I haven't got a girl in no port,
anyplace.

661
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,364
What I'm getting at is...

662
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,439
...I am innocent too.

663
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,772
What? No.

664
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,471
- I don't believe it.
- Well, it's true, though.

665
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,208
This is the first time
I really wanted to.

666
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,353
Wanted to what?

667
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,386
Make love.

668
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,218
You, a sailor.

669
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,621
Well, I had opportunities to, but...

670
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,195
Well, I always thought of my mother.

671
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,758
Well, I always asked myself,
would she or would she not think

672
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,994
this or that person was decent.

673
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,062
But...

674
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,709
But with my daughter, my Rosa,
your mother tell you,

675
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,037
"OK, go ahead, son." Huh, no?

676
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,146
Oh, Mrs. Delle Rose...
Mrs. Delle Rose, I...

677
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,680
She say she's in love.

678
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,918
And you?
You say you are in love?

679
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:01,413
Yes, ma'am, I do.
I'm in love, very much.

680
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,725
Cretini. Tutti e due.

681
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,357
I'm ready for Diamond Key.

682
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:10,260
Get out on the porch, Diamond Key.

683
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,729
Ale, ale.

684
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:14,801
Ale.

685
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:18,671
- Yes, Mama.
- OK.

686
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,281
- What are you, Catholic?
- Me? Yes, ma'am. Catholic.

687
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,417
- You don't look Catholic to me.
- Mama, how do Catholics look?

688
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,052
Do they look different
from anyone else?

689
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,779
You will stay out on the porch. Huh?

690
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,818
- All right.
- Thank you.

691
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,255
Turn around, will you?

692
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,430
- Do what, ma'am?
- I said, turn around.

693
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,394
Mama, what are you doing?

694
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,295
Get out till I call you!

695
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,207
Why do they make them Navy pants
so tight? I don't know.

696
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,641
That's a question you'll have to ask
the Navy, Mrs. Delle Rose.

697
00:46:56,847 --> 00:47:00,010
Mama, will you stop asking
so many questions?

698
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,720
You see what I got?

699
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,946
A wild thing in the house.

700
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,090
Mrs. Delle Rose...
Delle Rose,

701
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,261
I guess Sicilians
are very emotional people.

702
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,624
I want nobody
to take advantage of that.

703
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,131
Look, you got the wrong idea
about me, Mrs. Delle Rose.

704
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,859
I know what men want.

705
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,564
Not to eat ice cream with girls
or dance on the floor, no.

706
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,539
And boys are the same,
only younger.

707
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,304
- Come here.
- Mama!

708
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,982
Mama! Let me in the door, Jack!

709
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,810
Mrs. Delle Rose,
your daughter's calling you.

710
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,953
Let her call. Don't worry about it.
Come here. Come here.

711
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,750
- You said you're a Catholic, ain't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

712
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,027
- Kneel down here.
- Mama, now what?

713
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,557
Go away, will you?

714
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,862
And say after me what I say.

715
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,936
What? Why? Why?

716
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,333
I promise the Holy Mother

717
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,736
- that I will respect the...
- Mama!

718
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:03,379
Today I kill you if you don't leave.

719
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,645
- Are you gonna say it?
- Yes, ma'am.

720
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,343
OK.

721
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,151
- Go ahead.
- What was it again?

722
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,660
I promise the Holy Mother...

723
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,530
I promise the Holy Mother...

724
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,927
That I will respect the innocence...

725
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,068
That I will respect the innocence...

726
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,671
Of the daughter Rosa
of Rosario Delle Rose.

727
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:33,866
Of the daughter Rosa
of Mrs. Delle Rose.

728
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:37,638
No, Rosario Delle Rose.

729
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,442
Of Rosario Delle Rose.

730
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,654
Get up.

731
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,483
I'm satisfied.

732
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,723
- Wonderful!
- I'm satisfied.

733
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,418
- Wonderful, Mama.
- Let me breathe. Let me breathe.

734
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:55,257
Let me go! Let me go!

735
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,695
- No, please, Mama.
- Crazy thing. Crazy...

736
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,801
- Jack, kiss Mama.
- Mama, kiss Jack.

737
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,130
Won't kiss Jack! Won't kiss Jack!

738
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,206
Are you crazy, kiss? Me? Me?

739
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,400
Oh, my.

740
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,608
Kiss my hand.

741
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:13,806
- OK.
- Mama, get some wine glasses.

742
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,760
There, there.

743
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:28,054
Oh, they're here.
They're calling. Coming!

744
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,823
Come on, Jack!
Come on, Rosa!

745
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,628
OK, OK! Goodbye, Mama.
Goodbye.

746
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,032
- Good night, Mrs. Delle Rose.
- Goodbye, but...

747
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,729
But the wine.

748
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,169
Come on, let's go!

749
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,177
The wristwatch.

750
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,214
Where is it?

751
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,253
Rosa! Rosa!

752
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,218
Your little wristwatch!

753
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,618
With seventeen jewels in it! Rosa!

754
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,191
Rosa, Rosa.

755
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,889
Rosa, Rosa.

756
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,240
Oh, Lady, speak to me.

757
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,711
Tell me it isn't true.

758
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,856
Give me a sign.

759
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,363
Give me a sign.

760
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:41,070
Get your ice-cold lemonade.
Fine soft drinks.

761
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,312
N-37.

762
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,347
N-37.

763
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,611
Thirty-one. N-31.

764
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,948
B-46.

765
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,591
B-46.

766
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:18,873
Serafina Delle Rose, come sta, cara?
Come and sit down.

767
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,544
I got to see Father De Leo.
Where is Father De Leo?

768
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,270
- Sit down, please.
- No, I must find Father De Leo now.

769
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:27,245
- Have a seat, lady.
- I want you to meet my brother.

770
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,078
- Pleased to...
- Hello, hello.

771
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,311
- Take my chair.
- No, just find me the Father now.

772
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,819
This is the bachelor brother
I talk to you about.

773
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,958
He is working.
He is in his work clothes.

774
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,855
I am sorry you should meet him
like this in his work clothes.

775
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,155
Yeah, I got a big load of bananas
in my truck.

776
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:43,696
- I bring the folks here, now I go.
- Later, later.

777
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,561
Later I come back to pick up the folks.

778
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,930
Silence. Shut up, stupid.

779
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,332
Speak English.

780
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:52,267
You look tired.
Here, sit down in the chair.

781
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:53,670
Father De Leo!

782
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,805
I'm sorry.

783
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,408
- B-10!
- Me, me. Bingo. Bingo, me.

784
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,450
Bingo, bingo. Bingo.

785
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,752
Father De Leo...

786
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,449
- I got to see you, Father.
- Why, Serafina?

787
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,492
Let me talk to you, Father, please.
Come away from here.

788
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:13,856
You know these ladies.

789
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,999
- I know, I know. Hello.
- Serafina.

790
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,861
But this is private, Father.

791
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,867
You ladies, please, go.
Play with the bingo.

792
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,437
Thank you.

793
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,338
Bingo! I can't talk here, Father.
Come away from here.

794
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,136
Calm yourself, Serafina.

795
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,906
- We can talk in my office.
- Yes, thank you.

796
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,521
No. No, Father.
Not through the church, please.

797
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,055
- What's the matter?
- Where I was married, no.

798
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:45,023
Where you were married, where
your child was baptized and confirmed.

799
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,322
No, Father, please.
Not through the church.

800
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,675
Here.

801
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,879
We can talk here.

802
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:17,384
I fell down when I was married.

803
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,562
Do you remember, Father?

804
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,958
You collapsed at the altar.

805
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,897
I had just come to this country.
Do you remember?

806
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,296
Yes, I remember.

807
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:32,373
The marriage had been
arranged by letter,

808
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,339
exchanged between you and...

809
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,407
You remember.

810
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,808
I thought he would be ugly.

811
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,516
I couldn't speak.

812
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,152
I couldn't speak
from the moment I saw him

813
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,084
till the night after the marriage.

814
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,584
Then I said only, "Oh, love."

815
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,821
"Oh, love."

816
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,530
I had married a rose.

817
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,068
I didn't know I was
going to marry a rose.

818
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,802
I couldn't speak nothing in English
except, "Oh, love."

819
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,413
"Oh, love."

820
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:15,985
"Oh, love." Oh, Father!
I can't breathe in this building.

821
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:21,615
I can't breathe in this building
where I was married, Father.

822
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,017
Serafina. Serafina.

823
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,753
I am not going to spare
your feelings, Serafina.

824
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:31,991
I'm gonna talk to you honestly,
as your spiritual father.

825
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,732
I am shocked. I am shocked
at the change in your...

826
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,500
In your appearance and behavior
since the loss of your husband.

827
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,610
Grief is a natural and dignified thing,

828
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,838
but like every other emotion, Serafina,

829
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,949
it can become excessive.

830
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,917
Then... Then it becomes
a sort of self-indulgence.

831
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,749
I knew this was going to happen

832
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,585
when you refused to obey
the laws of the church

833
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,693
and had your husband cremated.

834
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:02,395
I remember you dressed in blue silk.

835
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,261
Yes, yes. Like a lady wearing
a piece of the weather.

836
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,163
You walked tall and proud.

837
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,166
Now, you crouch and you shuffle.

838
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:13,206
You... You live and dress
like a convict.

839
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,968
You have no companions.

840
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:18,170
You're rude to your neighbors.
You don't mix with the women who...

841
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:21,077
They make the life without glory.

842
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:24,276
They make the life without glory.

843
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,422
I gave my husband much glory.

844
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:32,116
I was the peasant,
but I gave him glory.

845
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:36,459
I came to him with one dress,
but I brought him glory.

846
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,329
He was a baron,
and I brought him glory.

847
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,233
I brought him glory, glory.

848
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,930
Glory.

849
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:48,872
I don't believe that he took this glory
I gave him and gave me horns.

850
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,606
I don't believe he gave me horns,
Father!

851
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,448
What do you want from me?

852
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:59,455
Go to the bingo.

853
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,056
- Per I'amor di Dio.
- Go!

854
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,920
Serafina, the ladies only want
to be your friends.

855
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,595
Friendly?

856
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,291
They think they know something
that Serafina don't know.

857
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,764
They think I have these on my head.

858
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,960
But I ain't. No, I ain't!

859
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,866
Serafina, I think you
imagine too much.

860
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,007
The ladies want to be
your companions.

861
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,370
Companions. Them ladies.

862
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:24,741
The dummies I got in my house,
they make much better companions,

863
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,779
because they don't make up no lies.

864
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:30,942
No, no. What kind of ladies
are them women, huh?

865
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,622
At 30 years old, they got
no more use for the marriage,

866
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:36,849
except for the money,
the shoes, the food.

867
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,528
- What do you call this kind of ladies?
- Attenzione.

868
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,289
To me the marriage was beautiful,
like a religion.

869
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,865
Now my marriage
is dreams and memories only.

870
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,162
And I don't believe that the man
I keep in my heart gave me horns.

871
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,566
I don't believe, no!

872
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:54,574
I don't believe!
I don't believe he gave me horns!

873
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,406
The whole village is... Well,
the whole village is laughing at you.

874
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:58,706
Me too, I'm laughing.

875
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,748
- Listen to me! I'm laughing too!
- Serafina.

876
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:04,146
- Laughing!
- Serafina Delle Rose.

877
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,879
- Why aren't you laughing anymore?
- I think you had better go home.

878
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,079
- Serafina.
- No.

879
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,691
I think you had better go home.
Yes, I'll talk to you later.

880
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:14,523
No. Later's too late, Father.
You've got to tell me now.

881
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,130
Tell you what?

882
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:22,635
You used to... You used to hear
the confession of my husband.

883
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,830
Father, please,

884
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,441
did my husband ever speak of a...?

885
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,135
- Of a woman to you?
- Serafina.

886
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,541
Oh, Father, rispondetemi...

887
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,774
...this one question.

888
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,009
Did he ever speak of a woman to you?

889
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,245
- Serafina, how...?
- Tell...

890
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,653
- How can I tell you something I...?
- Tell me, Father. You got to tell me.

891
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,656
Serafina...

892
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,728
- Father, tell me. Please, tell me.
- Serafina.

893
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,661
You know better than to ask me
such a question.

894
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,495
The secrets of the confessional
are sacred to the priests.

895
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:54,795
- I know.
- They are never...

896
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:57,234
- They are never repeated.
- I know, but tell me.

897
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,873
You got to tell me.

898
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,507
- Tell me, Father.
- Please, Serafina. Let go of me.

899
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:04,539
Not till you tell me this question,
this answer. I want it. I want it.

900
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,037
Let go of me. Let go of me.

901
00:58:06,241 --> 00:58:07,606
- Tell me, I let go.
- Let go of me.

902
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,402
- You don't tell, I never let go.
- Please.

903
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,239
I go mad! I go crazy! I never let go!

904
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,040
I never let go, Father.

905
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:16,046
- I tell you, Father.
- Mr. Mangiacavallo.

906
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:19,049
Mr. Mangiacavallo, please help me
calm this woman down.

907
00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:20,949
I'll speak to her later,
when she's more calm.

908
00:58:21,156 --> 00:58:22,714
Father! Father!

909
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:25,860
Oh, please. Please.

910
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:28,489
Father De Leo!

911
00:58:28,697 --> 00:58:30,460
Father De Leo!

912
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:34,124
Father De Leo, tell me please.

913
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:37,772
Tell me, please. Tell me, please.

914
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:40,567
Tell me. Tell me.

915
00:58:43,879 --> 00:58:45,312
Come on.

916
00:58:45,514 --> 00:58:47,209
You'll be all right.

917
00:59:01,764 --> 00:59:04,289
- Where am I?
- This... This is my truck.

918
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,592
It's OK.

919
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:07,234
- No, where...?
- You're OK.

920
00:59:07,436 --> 00:59:08,926
I drive you home from the church.

921
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:10,638
You rest.

922
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,003
I'm sorry I couldn't take
you home in a taxicab.

923
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:17,701
But I'm a bachelor
with three dependents,

924
00:59:17,913 --> 00:59:21,076
I can't afford no cab fare.
And you didn't have a purse with you.

925
00:59:21,283 --> 00:59:22,944
Oh, yeah. Where is my purse?

926
00:59:23,152 --> 00:59:26,178
- Did you have a purse with you?
- I think so. I don't know.

927
00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:27,548
You want to go back and get it?

928
00:59:27,756 --> 00:59:28,950
- We'll look for it?
- No, no, no.

929
00:59:29,158 --> 00:59:30,750
- You sure?
- I want to go home, please.

930
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:32,790
That's almost where you are now.

931
01:00:43,232 --> 01:00:46,599
When somebody else
is crying I gotta cry too.

932
01:00:46,802 --> 01:00:50,033
I'm sympathetic.
I got too much of a heart.

933
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:52,207
Don't cry. Why should you cry?

934
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:55,865
I know. It ain't like a man.

935
01:00:56,078 --> 01:00:59,536
Oh, a man sometimes
has to cry like anyone else.

936
01:00:59,748 --> 01:01:01,113
You're very understanding.

937
01:01:01,316 --> 01:01:04,649
Sometimes a man has to cry
the same as a woman.

938
01:01:04,853 --> 01:01:07,651
A man is not so different
from anyone else.

939
01:01:07,856 --> 01:01:09,653
- Take it.
- Oh, grazie.

940
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:20,664
You stop that, then I'll stop too, huh?

941
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:22,769
No, you stop first, and I'll stop.

942
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:26,134
No, you first.
Ladies first, you know?

943
01:01:28,343 --> 01:01:30,072
Ladies first.

944
01:01:37,052 --> 01:01:38,349
I stop. OK?

945
01:01:38,554 --> 01:01:40,522
OK, me too. I stop, see?

946
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,087
Your shirt is torn, huh?

947
01:01:48,297 --> 01:01:49,628
Oh, yes, Mrs. Delle Rose.

948
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,322
You tore it when I pulled you
away from the priest.

949
01:01:52,568 --> 01:01:53,626
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

950
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,997
- I'll sew it for you.
- Oh, that's nothing. It's nothing.

951
01:01:57,205 --> 01:02:00,333
- Forget it.
- I'll sew it for you. Come on.

952
01:02:01,376 --> 01:02:03,537
I'm ready to laugh now.

953
01:02:05,147 --> 01:02:06,114
Oh, my.

954
01:02:06,315 --> 01:02:08,146
I'm sorry you lost your pocketbook,
you know?

955
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,318
How much money you got
in the pocketbook? Much?

956
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,749
Don't worry about it.
Let me worry about it.

957
01:02:12,955 --> 01:02:14,320
Give me your shirt.

958
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,324
And, please, will you
open the shutters for me?

959
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,426
- I can't see.
- Oh, sure. Sure.

960
01:02:26,802 --> 01:02:28,929
A little bit.

961
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,907
What, lady?

962
01:02:33,976 --> 01:02:36,740
The light on the body was like
a man that lived here.

963
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,574
- What?
- Oh, my.

964
01:02:42,784 --> 01:02:43,944
Ma che strano.

965
01:02:44,152 --> 01:02:45,642
Your people,
they come from Naples?

966
01:02:45,854 --> 01:02:48,152
- No, no. Sicily.
- Sicily!

967
01:02:48,957 --> 01:02:50,447
Well, what's the matter?

968
01:02:50,659 --> 01:02:53,560
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Che c'e?

969
01:02:54,162 --> 01:02:56,062
Nothing. Nothing.

970
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,133
You got a bathroom in your house?

971
01:03:00,335 --> 01:03:03,031
- You got a bathroom in your house?
- Of course we have a bathroom.

972
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,762
- We don't have one at our house.
- No?

973
01:03:04,973 --> 01:03:07,100
And I would like to wash up,
because I think maybe I smell

974
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:08,367
like a goat, you know?

975
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,636
- Oh, please. Help yourself.
- Grazie.

976
01:03:10,846 --> 01:03:11,904
- This way.
- Con permesso.

977
01:03:12,114 --> 01:03:13,274
Prego.

978
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:16,847
Oh, Madonna Santa.

979
01:03:17,486 --> 01:03:22,116
Madonna Santa, my husband's
body with a head of a clown.

980
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:25,122
A clown that smells like a goat.

981
01:03:25,894 --> 01:03:27,521
Oh, Lady. Lady, speak to me.

982
01:03:27,729 --> 01:03:29,890
Is it the sign, this?

983
01:03:33,402 --> 01:03:34,664
Oh, please.

984
01:03:52,554 --> 01:03:54,647
- Ciao!
- Oh, ciao. You startled me.

985
01:03:54,856 --> 01:03:57,120
I washed up. I feel better.
You feel better too?

986
01:03:57,325 --> 01:03:58,553
Yeah, much better, thank you.

987
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,160
Now I cried, and I feel much better.

988
01:04:01,363 --> 01:04:03,024
That's good.

989
01:04:03,231 --> 01:04:06,029
Yeah, and now I can't get up.

990
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:10,330
- You mean you can't get down.
- I mean... Yeah, I can't get down.

991
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:16,174
What's that you got in your hand?
A bottle of vino?

992
01:04:16,378 --> 01:04:18,005
- What?
- Vino. Is that vino?

993
01:04:18,213 --> 01:04:20,408
Yeah, Spumanti it is. Yeah.

994
01:04:20,615 --> 01:04:24,107
It comes from the house
of the family of my husband.

995
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,254
A very great family, you know.
The Delle Rose. Barons.

996
01:04:27,456 --> 01:04:29,151
- Barons?
- Yes. I...

997
01:04:29,357 --> 01:04:31,825
I was a peasant,
but I married a baron.

998
01:04:32,027 --> 01:04:34,086
I married a baron
when I didn't have shoes.

999
01:04:34,296 --> 01:04:36,059
Oh, shoes. What shoes?

1000
01:04:36,264 --> 01:04:39,597
You had three very sweet things.
Heart, face and figure.

1001
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:40,893
And even a baron's human.

1002
01:04:41,103 --> 01:04:42,866
- You know, like a truck driver.
- Yeah.

1003
01:04:43,071 --> 01:04:46,939
- I sew the shirt now for you, huh?
- OK.

1004
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,974
I'm a very frank person.
I'll tell you something.

1005
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:53,977
My old-maid sister, she wanted us
to meet each other.

1006
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:55,581
- Yeah? Why?
- Well, she says,

1007
01:04:55,784 --> 01:04:58,844
"This very nice lady, this widow,
this baronessa,

1008
01:04:59,054 --> 01:05:01,488
"she's lonely and you're lonely.
Why don't you get acquainted?"

1009
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,056
She wanted us to meet each other
before this time, you know?

1010
01:05:04,259 --> 01:05:05,521
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1011
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:11,029
I'm a frank person, too,
and I'll tell you something now.

1012
01:05:11,233 --> 01:05:13,793
You can tell your sister
I don't need to meet nobody,

1013
01:05:14,002 --> 01:05:16,869
because my husband is with me.
We are not separated.

1014
01:05:17,072 --> 01:05:19,768
I turn around, and I see my husband
here with me in this...

1015
01:05:19,975 --> 01:05:21,465
Bottle?

1016
01:05:21,676 --> 01:05:23,644
Bottle.

1017
01:05:23,845 --> 01:05:27,110
Urn. Marble urn. Come here.

1018
01:05:27,315 --> 01:05:31,615
You see, the ashes of the rose
that I keep in my heart.

1019
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,311
I'm sorry, I...

1020
01:05:34,523 --> 01:05:35,922
No, it's nothing.

1021
01:05:36,158 --> 01:05:37,989
The priest was against it.

1022
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:41,786
It broke the laws of the church.

1023
01:05:41,997 --> 01:05:43,555
I know.

1024
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:46,563
But I had...
I had to have something.

1025
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:48,531
And this was all I could have.

1026
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,062
I think God has forgiven.

1027
01:05:52,274 --> 01:05:54,105
What makes you think
that God has forgiven?

1028
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:56,004
- I know him.
- You know him?

1029
01:05:56,211 --> 01:05:59,044
I know him. He has forgiven.
You'll see.

1030
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:02,808
Nobody knows how lonely
someone can be.

1031
01:06:03,018 --> 01:06:05,714
There's nothing wrong with it.
The body would've decayed,

1032
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:08,321
but the ashes always stay clean,
you know?

1033
01:06:08,523 --> 01:06:09,956
Gentle.

1034
01:06:10,826 --> 01:06:13,294
You see,
this is our wedding picture.

1035
01:06:13,962 --> 01:06:17,523
Hey. Che bell'uomo.

1036
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,795
Yeah, a rose of a man, my husband.
A rose, a rose.

1037
01:06:22,003 --> 01:06:23,994
On his chest he had
a rose tattoo, you know?

1038
01:06:24,206 --> 01:06:25,264
- A rose tattoo?
- Yeah.

1039
01:06:25,473 --> 01:06:26,872
- No.
- A rose tattoo.

1040
01:06:27,075 --> 01:06:29,475
- Let me see.
- Oh. "Let me see."

1041
01:06:29,678 --> 01:06:32,203
- "Let me see."
- Yeah, right.

1042
01:06:32,414 --> 01:06:34,439
Do you believe strange things?

1043
01:06:34,649 --> 01:06:37,880
I would like to tell you something,
but I got to speak frankly, you know?

1044
01:06:38,086 --> 01:06:39,986
Speak frankly. We're both
grown-up adult people.

1045
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:44,056
Yeah. You know, my husband,
he had this rose tattoo on his chest.

1046
01:06:44,259 --> 01:06:48,161
One night I woke up
with a burning pain on me here.

1047
01:06:48,363 --> 01:06:51,992
I turned on the light in the bedroom,
and I looked in the mirror.

1048
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,192
On my breast, I saw
the rose tattoo of my husband.

1049
01:06:55,403 --> 01:06:56,893
On me here, his tattoo.

1050
01:06:57,105 --> 01:06:59,300
- Strano.
- Yeah.

1051
01:06:59,507 --> 01:07:01,975
And this was the night that...

1052
01:07:02,177 --> 01:07:06,079
- Yeah, but I got to speak frankly.
- Speak frankly. Come on.

1053
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:09,250
That was the night that I got my son.

1054
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:13,080
The little boy that I lost
when I lost Rosario.

1055
01:07:13,288 --> 01:07:14,915
- When I lost my husband.
- Strano.

1056
01:07:15,123 --> 01:07:17,318
Ah, si. Che davvero.

1057
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,928
Would you be willing
to show me the rose tattoo?

1058
01:07:21,129 --> 01:07:22,756
- What?
- Well...

1059
01:07:22,964 --> 01:07:25,296
It's gone now. Oh, please.

1060
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,901
It only lasted a moment,
but I saw it so clearly.

1061
01:07:29,104 --> 01:07:30,731
So clearly, I saw it.

1062
01:07:30,939 --> 01:07:33,032
- You believe me?
- Si, si. Lo credo.

1063
01:07:33,241 --> 01:07:34,970
Maybe it could be back, no?

1064
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,235
I don't know why I told you,
you know?

1065
01:07:37,445 --> 01:07:41,404
- Well, I just...
- Only because I liked what you say.

1066
01:07:41,616 --> 01:07:45,950
That bodies decay, but the ashes
always stay clean. Immacolato.

1067
01:07:47,422 --> 01:07:49,253
But there are some people...

1068
01:07:49,457 --> 01:07:52,654
Oh, there are some people,
they want to make everything dirty.

1069
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:55,762
Everything dirty, believe me.

1070
01:07:55,964 --> 01:07:58,330
Two of them kind of people
come in the house today

1071
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,195
and told me a terrible lie...
about my husband.

1072
01:08:01,403 --> 01:08:04,065
So terrible a lie that if I thought
it was true, you know,

1073
01:08:04,272 --> 01:08:06,263
I would smash it.
Smash the urn, like...

1074
01:08:06,474 --> 01:08:08,305
- Like this!
- No, no, lady.

1075
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,740
- Not the wine.
- Oh, no.

1076
01:08:10,946 --> 01:08:14,245
- Not the wine.
- Not the wine. No, don't be afraid.

1077
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:15,814
Not the wine. Not the wine.

1078
01:08:16,017 --> 01:08:18,076
- Will you open the wine for me?
- Sure, sure.

1079
01:08:18,286 --> 01:08:20,220
- Thank you. Oh, my head.
- What...?

1080
01:08:21,323 --> 01:08:23,223
Well, what kind of a lie
did they tell you?

1081
01:08:23,425 --> 01:08:26,724
No, no, no.
I don't want to talk about it.

1082
01:08:26,928 --> 01:08:30,728
I don't believe the lie.
I don't believe the lie.

1083
01:08:30,932 --> 01:08:33,730
The memory of the rose
in my heart is perfect.

1084
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:45,510
Oh, I like a lady that laughs
with all her heart.

1085
01:08:46,214 --> 01:08:48,546
And a lady that cries with her heart?

1086
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,911
I like everything a lady
does with her heart.

1087
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:53,519
- Look at your face!
- I know!

1088
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,482
- Here.
- What's happening?

1089
01:08:57,692 --> 01:09:00,320
Hey, you kids! Get off of that truck!

1090
01:09:00,528 --> 01:09:02,621
Keep your paws off
of them bananas!

1091
01:09:03,698 --> 01:09:04,665
Oh, I forgot.

1092
01:09:04,866 --> 01:09:06,697
- You haul bananas?
- Si, signora.

1093
01:09:06,901 --> 01:09:09,734
I was supposed to get my truck
into Biloxi an hour, two hours ago.

1094
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,235
It's a five-ton truck?

1095
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,872
- A three-ton truck.
- Three?

1096
01:09:13,074 --> 01:09:15,474
My husband hauled bananas
in a five-ton truck.

1097
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:17,608
- Well, he was a baron.
- He was...

1098
01:09:17,812 --> 01:09:21,612
- Yeah. Did you haul just bananas?
- Just bananas. What else?

1099
01:09:21,816 --> 01:09:23,784
My husband hauled bananas,
but underneath the bananas

1100
01:09:23,985 --> 01:09:25,316
was something else, you know.

1101
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,114
Oh, he was wild like a Gypsy.

1102
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:30,484
He was wild like a Gypsy.

1103
01:09:32,494 --> 01:09:34,724
Where did I hear that before?

1104
01:09:34,929 --> 01:09:37,295
He was wild like a Gyp...

1105
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:39,957
I hate to start to remember,
you know?

1106
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,734
And then not to remember,
you know?

1107
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:44,530
I better call my boss in Biloxi,
explain how come I'm so late.

1108
01:09:44,739 --> 01:09:46,798
- It's a long-distance call?
- Don't worry about it.

1109
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:50,842
No, no, please. I don't worry
about it. You will pay.

1110
01:09:51,046 --> 01:09:52,343
- Hello, operator?
- Umber, please.

1111
01:09:52,547 --> 01:09:55,983
Get me the Southern Fruit Company
in Biloxi, 2-4-6-8-1. That's right.

1112
01:09:56,184 --> 01:09:59,620
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, my number is 6-6-9-9.

1113
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,345
That's right.

1114
01:10:04,025 --> 01:10:06,323
You know, you got a nice,
cozy little home-like place here.

1115
01:10:06,528 --> 01:10:10,020
Yeah. How is the place
where you live in?

1116
01:10:10,231 --> 01:10:13,325
I got a place with three
dependents in it.

1117
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:14,991
The line is busy.

1118
01:10:15,203 --> 01:10:16,636
- Prego.
- Hey, grazie.

1119
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:18,533
What dependents?

1120
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:22,400
- Is good Spumanti.
- This is good.

1121
01:10:22,644 --> 01:10:24,874
Well, there's...
There's the one old-maid sister,

1122
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,742
one feeble-minded grandmother
and one lush of a pop

1123
01:10:27,949 --> 01:10:31,146
who ain't worth the powder it takes
to blow him to... Scusatemi.

1124
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,819
You know,
they got the Parchesi habit.

1125
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:34,545
- Yeah?
- They play the game of Parchesi

1126
01:10:34,756 --> 01:10:35,950
morning, night and noon.

1127
01:10:36,157 --> 01:10:38,625
And they pass the cans of beer
around the table.

1128
01:10:39,127 --> 01:10:40,992
They got the beer habit too?

1129
01:10:41,262 --> 01:10:42,752
And the numbers habit.

1130
01:10:42,964 --> 01:10:44,556
You know, this spring
my old-maid sister,

1131
01:10:44,766 --> 01:10:47,701
she gets some kind of lady trouble.
Mostly mental, I think.

1132
01:10:47,902 --> 01:10:50,496
And she turns the housekeeping over
to the feeble-minded grandmother,

1133
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:53,037
who's a very sweet old lady,
but who don't think it's necessary

1134
01:10:53,241 --> 01:10:54,230
to pay the grocery bills

1135
01:10:54,442 --> 01:10:57,343
as long as she's got money
to play the numbers.

1136
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:00,047
She plays the numbers.
She's got a perfect system,

1137
01:11:00,248 --> 01:11:01,237
but it don't ever work.

1138
01:11:01,449 --> 01:11:05,909
And the grocery bills go up, up,
up so high you can't see them.

1139
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:09,053
- I better try my boss again.
- Yeah.

1140
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:13,589
I'll tell you my hopes and dreams.

1141
01:11:13,795 --> 01:11:15,319
- Who, me?
- Operator. The number, please.

1142
01:11:16,331 --> 01:11:18,356
Oh, excuse me.
Hello, operator?

1143
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:21,000
The Southern Fruit Company
in Biloxi, 2-4-6-8-1.

1144
01:11:21,202 --> 01:11:22,692
- That's right.
- May I have your number?

1145
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:25,031
My number is 6-6-9-9.

1146
01:11:25,874 --> 01:11:27,671
- 6-6-9-9, that's right.
- Yes, sir.

1147
01:11:27,876 --> 01:11:30,538
I'm hoping to meet some
sensible older lady, you know?

1148
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:34,408
I don't care if she's a little bit too plump
or not such a stylish dresser.

1149
01:11:34,616 --> 01:11:37,084
The important thing
in a lady is understanding.

1150
01:11:37,285 --> 01:11:38,513
- Good sense, you know?
- Yeah.

1151
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,780
And I want her to have a nice,
well-furnished house

1152
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:43,685
and a profitable little business
of some kind.

1153
01:11:43,892 --> 01:11:46,292
I see. And...

1154
01:11:46,494 --> 01:11:48,962
...such a lady, with a well-furnished
house and business,

1155
01:11:49,164 --> 01:11:51,428
what does she want with a man
with three dependents

1156
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:53,760
and the Parchesi and the beer habit,

1157
01:11:53,968 --> 01:11:55,936
plays the numbers? Oh, my!

1158
01:11:56,137 --> 01:11:59,265
Love and affection in a world that...
That's lonely and cold.

1159
01:11:59,474 --> 01:12:03,911
Yeah, it might be lonely, but I would
not say cold on this particular day.

1160
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:06,637
Love and affection is what I got
to offer on hot or cold days

1161
01:12:06,848 --> 01:12:08,475
in this lonely old world.
I got nothing else.

1162
01:12:08,683 --> 01:12:10,947
- Mangiacavallo has nothing.
- Who?

1163
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:13,484
- Me! Alvaro Mangiacavallo.
- Oh, yeah.

1164
01:12:13,688 --> 01:12:15,918
You know, Mangiacavallo means
"eat a horse". You know this.

1165
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:18,592
But I don't have a horse to eat,
not even a chicken.

1166
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:20,920
I'm the grandson
of the village idiot of Riveri.

1167
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:24,587
- Oh, I see you like to make jokes now.
- No, no. No joke. Davvero!

1168
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,699
He chased my grandmother
in a flooded rice field.

1169
01:12:26,901 --> 01:12:28,732
She slipped on a wet rock:

1170
01:12:28,937 --> 01:12:30,666
Ecco, here I am.

1171
01:12:31,239 --> 01:12:34,333
Oh, please. You should be
more respectful, you know?

1172
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:37,943
What have I got to respect?
The rock my grandmother slips on?

1173
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:39,875
Yourself at least.
You don't work for a living?

1174
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:42,379
Hey, if I don't work for a living
I would respect myself more.

1175
01:12:42,584 --> 01:12:45,280
- Yeah?
- Baronessa, I'm a healthy young man.

1176
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,681
Hey, I exist without
no genuine love life.

1177
01:12:47,889 --> 01:12:49,447
I look at them pictures
in the magazines...

1178
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:51,557
Them girls in the advertisements,
you know what I mean.

1179
01:12:51,759 --> 01:12:54,091
They got a little bitty thing here,
a little bitty thing there.

1180
01:12:54,295 --> 01:12:56,627
That's all they need,
they're so skinny!

1181
01:12:57,031 --> 01:12:59,966
Yeah. It's a long-distance call,
you know.

1182
01:13:00,168 --> 01:13:01,601
Is the line busy?

1183
01:13:01,803 --> 01:13:04,636
- Not the line, the boss.
- The boss.

1184
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:06,363
Get your boss on the phone
or hang up.

1185
01:13:06,574 --> 01:13:08,201
- OK, OK.
- Hello. Pilade talking.

1186
01:13:08,409 --> 01:13:10,969
Oh, hello!
Oh, hello, Mr. Pilade!

1187
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,477
How's things at the Southern
Fruit Company this hot afternoon?

1188
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:14,705
Yeah, Mangiacavallo!

1189
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:17,680
- I got a complaint about you.
- What? Well, what complaint?

1190
01:13:17,885 --> 01:13:20,217
- What happened?
- I tell you. Over three hours ago,

1191
01:13:20,421 --> 01:13:22,184
Joe passed the church
and seen your truck parked

1192
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:24,153
with the bananas and
you playing bingo.

1193
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:26,623
Ow, you get them bananas here.
You're fired, you hear?

1194
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:28,489
- What?
- Drive your truck for somebody else.

1195
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:31,494
Mr. Pilade!
Well, wait a minute, Mr...

1196
01:13:33,835 --> 01:13:35,302
- What's happened?
- What's happened?

1197
01:13:35,503 --> 01:13:37,368
A man with three dependents
out of a job.

1198
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:39,437
And my truck ain't even paid for.

1199
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:45,443
I can't see no more. I got
a suggestion to make you, huh?

1200
01:13:45,647 --> 01:13:49,583
Open that drawer, and you will
find a package with a shirt in it.

1201
01:13:49,784 --> 01:13:51,012
- This one?
- You can wear it

1202
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:53,210
and call for this one later.

1203
01:13:55,323 --> 01:13:57,917
- There's a name on it.
- No, don't tell me the name, please.

1204
01:13:58,426 --> 01:14:01,020
Throw it away. Out the window.

1205
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:03,288
Ecco fatto.

1206
01:14:04,999 --> 01:14:07,365
Seta! Seta puro!

1207
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,229
Oh, this shirt's too good
for Mangiacavallo.

1208
01:14:09,437 --> 01:14:11,200
Everything here is too good
for Mangiacavallo.

1209
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:14,341
Nothing's too good for a man,
if the man's good.

1210
01:14:14,809 --> 01:14:17,937
Put it on. You are welcome to it.

1211
01:14:25,853 --> 01:14:28,378
- Bella?
- Oh, bella.

1212
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:32,150
- Can I...?
- Sicuramenti. Prego.

1213
01:14:37,131 --> 01:14:41,898
- How does it feel, the silk on you?
- Just feels like a girl's hands on me.

1214
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:44,663
It will make you less trouble,
believe me.

1215
01:14:45,873 --> 01:14:49,240
You know, there's nothing more
beautiful than a gift between people.

1216
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:51,344
- No?
- Yeah.

1217
01:14:51,546 --> 01:14:53,946
You like me a little better now, huh?

1218
01:14:55,249 --> 01:14:58,548
You know what they should
have done when you was a baby?

1219
01:14:58,753 --> 01:15:00,983
- What?
- They should have put tape

1220
01:15:01,189 --> 01:15:04,056
on your ears... to hold them back.

1221
01:15:04,258 --> 01:15:08,194
Like this. Lookit.
Is not much better, huh?

1222
01:15:08,396 --> 01:15:11,229
So when you grow up,
they wouldn't stick out

1223
01:15:11,432 --> 01:15:14,526
like the wings of a little kewpie.

1224
01:15:18,005 --> 01:15:20,166
Lady, lady! The black goat
is loose again!

1225
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:23,037
II becco della strega.
Look at my tomatoes.

1226
01:15:23,244 --> 01:15:26,304
Look at my...! Oh, the strega.
She has a demon eye, you know.

1227
01:15:26,514 --> 01:15:28,345
Now, don't get excited.
Don't worry.

1228
01:15:28,549 --> 01:15:32,508
I will catch the black goat, and I'll give
him a kick he'll never forget.

1229
01:15:50,938 --> 01:15:52,530
Come on! Come on!

1230
01:15:56,544 --> 01:15:58,478
I got a friendship with goats.

1231
01:16:10,591 --> 01:16:11,922
Come on!

1232
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:47,725
It was nothing.

1233
01:16:52,133 --> 01:16:53,691
Oh, no. Please.

1234
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,266
Look.

1235
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:57,335
Oh, my.

1236
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:05,038
In here. Yeah.

1237
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,549
- OK.
- You're troppo gentile, signora.

1238
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,112
Delle Rose.

1239
01:17:11,986 --> 01:17:14,113
Signora Delle Rose.

1240
01:17:15,056 --> 01:17:16,353
I have to go now.

1241
01:17:16,557 --> 01:17:19,720
I know, I know. Please. Please.

1242
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:29,529
Wonderful. Oh, wonderful!

1243
01:17:30,071 --> 01:17:31,902
Excuse the way I'm not dressed.

1244
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:34,336
I'm not always like this, no.

1245
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:37,272
Sometimes I fix myself up, yeah.

1246
01:17:37,478 --> 01:17:40,413
When my husband was living,
when my husband comes home...

1247
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:44,142
When he was living, I had
a clean dress on, you know?

1248
01:17:44,352 --> 01:17:46,377
And sometimes even...

1249
01:17:46,587 --> 01:17:49,283
Even I put a rose in my hair.

1250
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:50,980
A rose in your hair would be pretty.

1251
01:17:51,192 --> 01:17:54,457
Oh, yeah, but not for a widow.
It's not the time of roses.

1252
01:17:54,662 --> 01:17:56,755
Why? You make a mistake.

1253
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,829
It's always for everybody
the time of the roses.

1254
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:00,432
- Yeah?
- The rose is...

1255
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:02,466
The rose is the heart
of the world like the...

1256
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:04,968
Like the heart is the heart
of the body. How's that?

1257
01:18:05,172 --> 01:18:06,537
Good, eh?

1258
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:08,834
But you, baronessa, you know
what I think you have done?

1259
01:18:09,043 --> 01:18:10,670
- What have I done?
- You have put your heart

1260
01:18:10,878 --> 01:18:13,005
in the marble urn with the ashes.
Oh, yes.

1261
01:18:13,214 --> 01:18:14,476
And if in a storm sometimes,

1262
01:18:14,682 --> 01:18:16,775
or sometime if a five-ton truck
goes down the highway

1263
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:18,747
and the marble urn was to break...

1264
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:23,513
Look! Look, baronessa!

1265
01:18:24,425 --> 01:18:25,915
Look what? I don't see.

1266
01:18:26,127 --> 01:18:29,324
I was pointing to your heart.
Broken out of the urn!

1267
01:18:30,064 --> 01:18:33,033
Rondinella felice!

1268
01:18:33,234 --> 01:18:36,795
Rondinella felice!

1269
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:41,873
Che buffone. I take you serious,
and you make jokes.

1270
01:18:42,076 --> 01:18:45,136
Your heart is a happy bird.

1271
01:18:48,749 --> 01:18:50,546
When I can bring the shirt back?

1272
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:57,715
- When you pass by again.
- I'll come back tonight, volete?

1273
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,383
OK.

1274
01:19:02,096 --> 01:19:03,961
Then look at the window tonight.

1275
01:19:04,165 --> 01:19:06,895
If the shutters are open
and there is a light in the window,

1276
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:09,865
you can stop by for your shirt.

1277
01:19:10,071 --> 01:19:11,538
But if the shutters are closed,

1278
01:19:11,739 --> 01:19:13,969
you better not stop because
my Rosa will be home.

1279
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:17,736
- Rosa?
- Yeah. Rosa's my daughter.

1280
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:21,673
There's nothing wrong in two grown-up
people having a quiet conversation,

1281
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,907
but Rosa's 15.

1282
01:19:24,118 --> 01:19:27,485
I must be careful to set her
a perfect example.

1283
01:19:27,688 --> 01:19:30,213
- I will look at the window!
- OK.

1284
01:19:30,424 --> 01:19:31,721
I will look at the win...

1285
01:19:31,926 --> 01:19:33,757
- Bang, bang!
- Hey, you little monkey.

1286
01:19:33,961 --> 01:19:36,555
- Get down off that truck.
- Go chase your head!

1287
01:19:36,764 --> 01:19:38,698
Come on. Come on. Get down.

1288
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,730
Here we go. Come on.

1289
01:19:40,935 --> 01:19:43,369
Jump!

1290
01:19:45,473 --> 01:19:47,532
You little monkey,
you lay off of them bananas.

1291
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:50,540
They're the property
of the Southern Fruit Company.

1292
01:19:52,013 --> 01:19:54,345
Of which I am no longer
a truck driver.

1293
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:07,327
Ciao.

1294
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:15,125
Hey, you!

1295
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:32,881
Oh, Rosario, forgive me

1296
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:36,488
for thinking the terrible lie
could be true.

1297
01:20:37,825 --> 01:20:39,725
Forgive me.

1298
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:48,932
You're in a mood.

1299
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,604
You act disgusted with me.

1300
01:20:53,674 --> 01:20:56,472
Ever since you met Mother,
you've acted different.

1301
01:20:56,677 --> 01:20:58,201
How different?

1302
01:20:58,412 --> 01:21:00,039
Cold.

1303
01:21:00,247 --> 01:21:02,647
Honey, your mother made me
understand the responsibility of...

1304
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:06,013
- Of what?
- Loving a very young girl.

1305
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:09,121
I'm old enough to get married.

1306
01:21:09,724 --> 01:21:10,952
Married?

1307
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:14,286
Yes! Married and have a baby.

1308
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:16,725
That's something to dream of.

1309
01:21:17,765 --> 01:21:19,528
You dream.

1310
01:21:20,067 --> 01:21:21,796
I am not a dreamer.

1311
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:24,630
I am not satisfied with dreams.

1312
01:21:27,374 --> 01:21:29,137
Look, they can see us.

1313
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:32,278
Lift the anchor and
take the boat out further.

1314
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,675
Miss Yorke has field glasses.

1315
01:21:34,882 --> 01:21:36,850
Field glasses! Field glasses!

1316
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:40,111
Well, they're German military field
glasses with 20 magnification.

1317
01:21:40,321 --> 01:21:42,016
Field glasses!

1318
01:21:54,268 --> 01:21:57,169
- Alvaro, what happened?
- You didn't get enough games today?

1319
01:21:57,371 --> 01:22:00,340
- Oh, che bello!
- Here, wrap this up, quick. Subito.

1320
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,907
- What? What?
- I borrowed it from the widow.

1321
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:05,476
- How's the Parchesi today?
- Oh, she cheats me.

1322
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:07,544
Sei tu che sei un imbroglione!

1323
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:09,978
- Imbroglione?
- On giochi bene, te I'ho detto!

1324
01:22:10,184 --> 01:22:13,551
- Onna, gioca. Tocca a te.
- Stupido! Anche tu! Anche tu!

1325
01:22:13,754 --> 01:22:16,348
Perche' gli lasci prendere
la-tua cravatta?

1326
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:22,189
Ma perche' tu imbrogli sempre,
imbrogli sempre? On lo vuoi capire.

1327
01:22:51,225 --> 01:22:54,023
- Hello.
- Oh, hello. You...?

1328
01:22:54,228 --> 01:22:55,957
You Mama Shigura?

1329
01:22:56,163 --> 01:22:58,859
You want tattoo? Portrait?

1330
01:22:59,066 --> 01:23:00,693
No. Tattoo.

1331
01:23:00,901 --> 01:23:03,597
But can you do it now?
Because I ain't got a lot of time.

1332
01:23:03,804 --> 01:23:06,602
OK. Very fast. Very good.

1333
01:23:06,807 --> 01:23:10,368
Formerly New Orleans.
Formerly Galveston.

1334
01:23:10,578 --> 01:23:13,604
Formerly Yokohama.
Very good.

1335
01:23:15,983 --> 01:23:18,850
I want a rose tattooed here,
here on my chest.

1336
01:23:19,053 --> 01:23:20,520
You understand? A rose.

1337
01:23:20,721 --> 01:23:23,155
OK. Six dollar.

1338
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,490
Oh, no. That's too much.

1339
01:23:26,694 --> 01:23:28,719
I give you $2.

1340
01:23:28,929 --> 01:23:31,727
OK. Four dollar. No stem.

1341
01:23:32,566 --> 01:23:34,534
Just a rose.

1342
01:23:35,769 --> 01:23:38,829
Two-fifty is all I got to spend
on a rose tattoo, see?

1343
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:40,836
I'll show you.

1344
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:42,065
OK. Very good.

1345
01:23:42,276 --> 01:23:44,744
Take off shirt. Sit down.

1346
01:23:44,945 --> 01:23:47,880
But you got to make me a nice,
big, beautiful rose, huh?

1347
01:23:48,082 --> 01:23:53,520
But for $2.50,
no leaf, no stem. Just the rose.

1348
01:23:53,721 --> 01:23:55,916
- The rose is all I need.
- OK.

1349
01:24:07,268 --> 01:24:08,929
It's cold!

1350
01:24:17,811 --> 01:24:20,302
I give you a little stem.

1351
01:25:01,422 --> 01:25:04,755
Where is it? Where is it?

1352
01:25:13,834 --> 01:25:15,859
Eccola qua. Quarda dov'era.

1353
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,334
Rondinella felice!

1354
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:23,237
I will look at the window!

1355
01:25:25,145 --> 01:25:26,669
C'e nessuno?

1356
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,404
Anybody home?

1357
01:25:28,615 --> 01:25:30,014
Sono qua.

1358
01:25:30,217 --> 01:25:31,912
Here I am.

1359
01:25:37,191 --> 01:25:39,022
Where you go?

1360
01:25:39,226 --> 01:25:41,592
- Well, good evening.
- Good evening.

1361
01:25:41,795 --> 01:25:42,989
- Well!
- What?

1362
01:25:43,197 --> 01:25:45,563
Say, you... Hey!

1363
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:49,497
- You... Look, your hair...
- What's...? What's the matter, huh?

1364
01:25:49,703 --> 01:25:51,671
I didn't expect to see
you looking so pretty.

1365
01:25:51,872 --> 01:25:53,737
You're a young little widow,
you know?

1366
01:25:53,941 --> 01:25:57,877
- You are... Fix yourself up.
- Yeah. I went to the Ideal Barbers.

1367
01:25:58,078 --> 01:25:59,705
I got the whole works,
including the bath.

1368
01:25:59,913 --> 01:26:01,574
- No!
- Yeah.

1369
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,272
Magnifique!

1370
01:26:03,484 --> 01:26:05,918
Oh, you got oil of roses
in your hair.

1371
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,246
Si, si! Olio di rose.

1372
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:10,617
- You like the smell of it? Smell it.
- Yeah, yeah. I like the smell of it.

1373
01:26:10,824 --> 01:26:13,349
You don't like the smell of it.
I'll wash it out. I'll take it off.

1374
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,222
I like it! I like it! I like.

1375
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,365
I like the smell of it. I like.

1376
01:26:19,566 --> 01:26:21,124
OK.

1377
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,737
Shall we sit down
in the parlor, huh?

1378
01:26:24,938 --> 01:26:27,202
I guess that's better than
standing up in the kitchen, no?

1379
01:26:27,408 --> 01:26:30,275
I think so. OK. OK.

1380
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:32,604
Oh, hey. Let me help you.
I'll take it. I'll take it.

1381
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,075
Oh, grazie.

1382
01:26:34,281 --> 01:26:36,442
Oh, excuse me. Ladies first.

1383
01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:44,717
Shall we...? Shall we sit
down on the sofa?

1384
01:26:44,925 --> 01:26:48,292
Yeah. You... You take the sofa.
I will sit down on this chair.

1385
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,486
But it's more easy to talk
with two on the sofa.

1386
01:26:50,697 --> 01:26:52,494
Yeah, but I lean back
too far on that sofa,

1387
01:26:52,699 --> 01:26:55,998
and I like a straight back
behind me, you know?

1388
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:59,300
But it's more easy to talk with two
on the sofa. You know what I mean?

1389
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,470
I talk just good on this chair as I talk
on that sofa. Sit down, please.

1390
01:27:08,449 --> 01:27:10,644
- Oh, can I help you?
- Oh, no. I'll put it over there.

1391
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,546
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

1392
01:27:16,757 --> 01:27:18,349
- I got a good surprise for you.
- Yeah?

1393
01:27:18,559 --> 01:27:21,926
- Wait till you see.
- No! Oh, my purse.

1394
01:27:22,129 --> 01:27:24,689
- Father De Leo had it in his office.
- Oh, thank you.

1395
01:27:24,898 --> 01:27:25,887
Open it. Count the money.

1396
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,762
- Why should I count the money?
- You're rich, and I'm poor.

1397
01:27:28,969 --> 01:27:30,402
How do you know
I didn't steal from you?

1398
01:27:30,604 --> 01:27:33,801
Oh, such an idea.
I would never think such a thing.

1399
01:27:34,007 --> 01:27:36,271
I would never dream of it,
believe me.

1400
01:27:36,477 --> 01:27:39,878
I want you to know that
I may be honest, but I'm poor.

1401
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,009
I'll put away the purse.

1402
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:45,810
- Excuse me, eh?
- Sure.

1403
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:06,133
- Good evening again.
- Good evening.

1404
01:28:06,373 --> 01:28:07,806
Good evening.

1405
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:12,408
I bet you counted the money, huh?

1406
01:28:12,613 --> 01:28:15,707
Yeah. I see you like
make jokes again, huh?

1407
01:28:17,117 --> 01:28:19,483
- I got another surprise for you.
- No. What?

1408
01:28:19,686 --> 01:28:22,780
- For you.
- Oh, no! Chocol...

1409
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,924
Chocolate... Chocolates...

1410
01:28:26,026 --> 01:28:29,052
Thank you, but, you know,
I'm too fat to eat candy.

1411
01:28:29,263 --> 01:28:30,753
- Oh, no.
- I can't.

1412
01:28:30,964 --> 01:28:32,693
Oh, no. You're not fat.

1413
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,460
You're just pleasing
and plump, you know?

1414
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:36,693
Yeah.

1415
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:40,340
- Don't make me nervous now, huh?
- All right.

1416
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:42,971
Thank you. Thank you.

1417
01:28:43,177 --> 01:28:45,668
- It's all right.
- Thank you. Bella.

1418
01:28:48,215 --> 01:28:49,614
Oh, I see you got a piano.

1419
01:28:49,816 --> 01:28:52,842
Yeah, yeah.
But I never touch it, no.

1420
01:28:53,053 --> 01:28:55,283
It's electric. You know,
I don't understand it.

1421
01:28:55,489 --> 01:28:58,253
I think it might give me a shock.

1422
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,985
- I'm afraid of this. I'm afraid.
- There's no... There's nothing to it.

1423
01:29:02,196 --> 01:29:03,595
I'll show you.

1424
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,128
- It's very simple.
- Don't touch it!

1425
01:29:05,332 --> 01:29:07,163
- You press this.
- Don't touch! I can't stop now.

1426
01:29:07,367 --> 01:29:09,392
I'm afraid, oh...

1427
01:29:09,603 --> 01:29:12,902
Look at... He's crazy, he's...
Oh, my!

1428
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:16,041
Will you stop the dance?! Please!

1429
01:29:17,711 --> 01:29:19,542
Oh, look!

1430
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:28,584
Chiudi quella finestra! Ma che modi!
Chiudi quella finestra!

1431
01:29:28,789 --> 01:29:31,121
- A guardano!
- Oh, yeah, yeah. OK.

1432
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:34,123
Dio mio! Turn on the lights!

1433
01:29:34,328 --> 01:29:36,796
- What? What?
- Turn on the lights, please!

1434
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,555
Turn on the lights!

1435
01:29:38,765 --> 01:29:40,926
I can't hear you!

1436
01:29:41,134 --> 01:29:43,159
Sit down like a gentleman,
or go home like a clown!

1437
01:29:43,370 --> 01:29:44,735
- Oh, scusatemi, baronessa!
- Va bene!

1438
01:29:44,938 --> 01:29:46,371
- I like the music too much.
- Sit down!

1439
01:29:46,573 --> 01:29:48,370
OK. Take it easy. Take it easy.

1440
01:29:48,575 --> 01:29:49,940
Sit down.

1441
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:52,008
Oh, I'm afraid now.

1442
01:29:52,212 --> 01:29:53,975
Oh, now, don't be afraid.
It's easy. Look.

1443
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:55,739
There you are. OK.

1444
01:29:55,949 --> 01:29:59,077
Oh, please. Look at this.
I got a daughter, 15, no?

1445
01:29:59,286 --> 01:30:01,777
- Fifteen daughters?
- Yeah, 15 daughters.

1446
01:30:01,989 --> 01:30:04,583
Age 15. One daughter. Clown!

1447
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,726
- I just make a joke.
- Yeah, I see. I see.

1448
01:30:07,928 --> 01:30:10,556
- Oh, excuse me.
- May I now?

1449
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:14,132
- Well, I'm so nervous tonight.
- Here, let me help you.

1450
01:30:14,334 --> 01:30:15,323
Why are you nervous?

1451
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,867
- Because she's going out with a sailor.
- Your daughter?

1452
01:30:18,071 --> 01:30:19,663
Yeah. Sit down, please.

1453
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:23,240
No, no. Not here.
Over there, over there.

1454
01:30:23,443 --> 01:30:28,107
I made him promise to respect
the innocence of my Rosa.

1455
01:30:29,149 --> 01:30:32,778
But how do I know that he will
respect the promise, you know?

1456
01:30:32,986 --> 01:30:34,851
Oh, baronessa, you got to face facts.

1457
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:37,523
Sooner or later the innocence
of your daughter cannot be respected

1458
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:39,351
if the family's gonna continue,
you know?

1459
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:42,960
Please, don't make comparisons,
huh?

1460
01:30:43,697 --> 01:30:45,324
Did he have a tattoo?

1461
01:30:45,532 --> 01:30:47,727
Did who have a what?

1462
01:30:48,869 --> 01:30:50,393
"Did who have a...?" The sailor.

1463
01:30:50,604 --> 01:30:53,539
The sailor your daughter has met,
did he have a tattoo?

1464
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:56,436
Why do you ask me if he had a tattoo?

1465
01:30:56,643 --> 01:30:58,941
Well, you know, most sailors
have got tattoos.

1466
01:30:59,146 --> 01:31:04,140
How do I know if he had a tattoo
or not? Are you crazy?

1467
01:31:05,385 --> 01:31:06,682
- I got a tattoo.
- No, really?

1468
01:31:06,887 --> 01:31:08,149
Yeah!

1469
01:31:09,389 --> 01:31:11,357
Oh, you make me laugh.

1470
01:31:11,558 --> 01:31:13,150
What kind of a tattoo you got?

1471
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,885
- What kind do you think?
- Oh, it's easy.

1472
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:19,031
A South Sea girl without clothes on.

1473
01:31:19,232 --> 01:31:20,665
- Oh, no, no.
- I'm sure.

1474
01:31:20,867 --> 01:31:22,858
- I'm sure.
- No South Sea girl without clothes on.

1475
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:24,970
- No?
- No, no.

1476
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:28,138
A big, red heart with "Mama".

1477
01:31:28,342 --> 01:31:30,708
"Mama" written across it.

1478
01:31:30,911 --> 01:31:33,072
You're wrong again, baronessa.

1479
01:31:33,647 --> 01:31:37,105
- What kind of tattoo you got?
- I show you.

1480
01:31:37,751 --> 01:31:39,343
See?

1481
01:31:43,156 --> 01:31:44,714
Well, what's the matter?

1482
01:31:44,925 --> 01:31:46,290
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter?

1483
01:31:46,493 --> 01:31:48,222
I don't feel good.

1484
01:31:48,428 --> 01:31:49,520
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

1485
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:51,891
- I got to go outside.
- I'm sorry, baronessa.

1486
01:31:52,099 --> 01:31:53,862
I got to go outside to breathe,
please.

1487
01:31:54,067 --> 01:31:56,126
Mi dispiace molto.

1488
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:58,304
I didn't mean to surprise you.

1489
01:31:58,505 --> 01:32:00,029
Don't talk about it.

1490
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,299
Anybody could have a rose tattoo.
It don't mean nothing.

1491
01:32:02,509 --> 01:32:04,500
- Sure, I know.
- You know, I can't breathe.

1492
01:32:04,711 --> 01:32:06,144
It's too hot tonight.

1493
01:32:06,346 --> 01:32:07,870
You know how a tin roof is.

1494
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:09,912
Yeah, I know.
It catches the sun all day,

1495
01:32:10,117 --> 01:32:12,278
- and it don't cool off until midnight.
- Yeah.

1496
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:14,545
Then it gets hot in the bedroom,
and the covers, they...

1497
01:32:14,755 --> 01:32:16,222
No, please! Please.

1498
01:32:16,423 --> 01:32:19,256
We got a strega.
A witch next door. Please!

1499
01:32:19,459 --> 01:32:21,188
Please don't touch me!

1500
01:32:22,262 --> 01:32:24,025
You got a bright house.

1501
01:32:25,232 --> 01:32:27,496
- You're burning kilowatt hours. Why?
- That's all right.

1502
01:32:27,701 --> 01:32:29,362
You don't have to pay
the light bill. Please!

1503
01:32:29,569 --> 01:32:32,197
Yeah, I know. But don't you feel
self-conscious with all the light on?

1504
01:32:32,406 --> 01:32:34,601
Everybody looks in. They watch us.
They see what we do.

1505
01:32:34,808 --> 01:32:37,641
Nothing is going on here
to be ashamed of.

1506
01:32:39,079 --> 01:32:40,205
- Nothing.
- Nothing!

1507
01:32:40,414 --> 01:32:41,847
Nothing.

1508
01:32:48,755 --> 01:32:51,485
Yeah. What are you
doing that for now?

1509
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:54,455
You know, the night is warm,
but my hands are freezing.

1510
01:32:54,661 --> 01:32:57,095
- Bad circulation.
- Too much circulation.

1511
01:32:57,297 --> 01:33:00,027
I feel the sweet warmth of a lady.
You know?

1512
01:33:00,233 --> 01:33:01,791
You talk a sweet mouth
to fool a...

1513
01:33:02,002 --> 01:33:04,334
- To fool a woman, huh?
- No, no, I know.

1514
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:07,002
That's what warms the world,
what makes it summer.

1515
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:08,902
Without it, the rose wouldn't
grow on the bush.

1516
01:33:09,109 --> 01:33:10,474
The fruit wouldn't grow on the tree.

1517
01:33:10,677 --> 01:33:12,542
And the truck would not haul
the bananas,

1518
01:33:12,746 --> 01:33:14,509
Mr. Mangiacavallo, I know!

1519
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:15,942
What, you don't like my poetry?

1520
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:17,548
No, I don't like your poetry!

1521
01:33:17,751 --> 01:33:19,844
How can a man talk to you?

1522
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:23,420
No, please!

1523
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:27,420
Is that your poetry?

1524
01:33:27,627 --> 01:33:29,561
Is that your poetry?

1525
01:33:29,763 --> 01:33:32,596
Andate a casa. Cialtrone!

1526
01:33:32,799 --> 01:33:34,767
- Go home!
- Understanding is so necessary.

1527
01:33:34,968 --> 01:33:36,993
- I understand plenty. Go home!
- Please, baronessa.

1528
01:33:37,204 --> 01:33:39,138
- Go home! Don't touch me!
- So soft is a lady...

1529
01:33:39,339 --> 01:33:40,897
Go home.

1530
01:33:41,341 --> 01:33:44,208
Everything in my life
turns out like this!

1531
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:48,006
Get up, you idiot's grandson!
Get up! Please!

1532
01:33:49,783 --> 01:33:51,216
Get up.

1533
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:58,815
Go home!

1534
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:05,895
And where is the shirt I loaned you?

1535
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:08,624
- What?
- Yeah, where is the shirt I loaned you?

1536
01:34:16,243 --> 01:34:18,040
My sister wrapped it up.

1537
01:34:18,245 --> 01:34:20,611
She was happy I met this nice lady.

1538
01:34:20,814 --> 01:34:22,645
Your sister.

1539
01:34:23,149 --> 01:34:25,014
Now, Mr. Mangiacavallo, please.

1540
01:34:25,218 --> 01:34:28,051
Tell me the truth about something.

1541
01:34:28,255 --> 01:34:31,884
When you put on the tattoo
on your chest, huh? When?

1542
01:34:34,394 --> 01:34:35,656
I got it tonight.

1543
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,958
You got it because I told you
about my husband's tattoo.

1544
01:34:39,165 --> 01:34:41,895
No, I wanted to be near you,
to make you happy, that's all.

1545
01:34:42,102 --> 01:34:43,831
Tell it to the Marines, please.

1546
01:34:44,037 --> 01:34:45,698
You are not smart enough.

1547
01:34:45,906 --> 01:34:47,498
Now, take the shirt back.

1548
01:34:47,707 --> 01:34:50,267
I don't want it! You can keep it now!

1549
01:34:50,477 --> 01:34:52,104
You just asked me for it.
What's the matter?

1550
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:54,212
Oh, you make me so nervous.
Please!

1551
01:34:54,414 --> 01:34:56,177
Is it my fault you been
a widow too long?

1552
01:34:56,383 --> 01:34:57,941
- You make a mistake.
- You make a mistake.

1553
01:34:58,151 --> 01:34:59,743
Both of us make a mistake tonight.

1554
01:34:59,953 --> 01:35:02,421
Both of us make a mistake!

1555
01:35:03,223 --> 01:35:04,815
You know, we should
have been friends.

1556
01:35:05,025 --> 01:35:06,856
I think maybe we meet
on the wrong day.

1557
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,755
I'll go out again, come in.
We start all over.

1558
01:35:08,962 --> 01:35:10,862
No, no. I think it's no use,

1559
01:35:11,064 --> 01:35:13,692
because the day was
wrong to begin with.

1560
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,365
Because of two women.

1561
01:35:15,569 --> 01:35:18,163
They told me my husband
was having a steady affair

1562
01:35:18,371 --> 01:35:20,737
with a woman at the Mardi Gras Club,
you know?

1563
01:35:20,941 --> 01:35:22,408
You know?

1564
01:35:23,109 --> 01:35:26,010
What was the name on the shirt?

1565
01:35:26,212 --> 01:35:28,043
On the slip of paper?

1566
01:35:28,248 --> 01:35:30,876
- I threw it out the window.
- Yeah, but tell me.

1567
01:35:31,084 --> 01:35:33,348
You remember the name?
What was the name?

1568
01:35:33,687 --> 01:35:35,552
I remember the name
because I know the woman.

1569
01:35:35,755 --> 01:35:38,315
- What is...?
- The name is Estelle Hohengarten.

1570
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:40,288
That was the name.

1571
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,551
That was the woman.

1572
01:35:43,063 --> 01:35:46,965
Yeah. You made me forget
for a little while.

1573
01:35:51,805 --> 01:35:54,273
OK. OK!

1574
01:35:54,474 --> 01:35:55,964
- Take me there!
- Oh, no, baronessa.

1575
01:35:56,176 --> 01:35:58,474
- Take me to the Mardi Gras now.
- No, don't go. Please stay.

1576
01:35:58,678 --> 01:36:01,545
Take me to the Mardi Gras now,
please!

1577
01:36:16,663 --> 01:36:18,392
Baronessa.

1578
01:36:18,598 --> 01:36:19,826
Serafina, please.

1579
01:36:20,033 --> 01:36:21,625
We go someplace else.
We dance maybe.

1580
01:36:21,835 --> 01:36:24,827
- We have fun.
- Let me go in, please, will you?

1581
01:36:33,113 --> 01:36:36,549
Where is the woman
Estelle Hohengarten, please?

1582
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:39,075
Where is the woman
Estelle Hohengarten?

1583
01:36:39,285 --> 01:36:42,812
Nobody knows where is the woman
Estelle Hohengarten.

1584
01:36:45,458 --> 01:36:49,417
Go away. I want to speak
to Estelle Hohengarten!

1585
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:54,123
Where is this woman? Please!

1586
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:57,960
Please.

1587
01:36:58,872 --> 01:37:00,100
Oh, please!

1588
01:37:05,445 --> 01:37:07,845
What do you know about my husband?

1589
01:37:08,515 --> 01:37:10,779
I'm the wife, remember?

1590
01:37:10,984 --> 01:37:12,679
What is the lie?

1591
01:37:12,886 --> 01:37:14,615
You liar!

1592
01:37:14,821 --> 01:37:16,618
- Liar!
- Estelle, tell her it's a lie.

1593
01:37:16,823 --> 01:37:18,222
- Tell her!
- What's a lie?

1594
01:37:18,425 --> 01:37:21,258
Liar! Liar!

1595
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:24,191
Remember? I brought you the
rose-colored silk to make him a shirt.

1596
01:37:24,397 --> 01:37:27,127
You said, "For a man?" I said, "Yes,
for a man that's wild like a Gypsy."

1597
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:28,857
Remember?

1598
01:37:29,069 --> 01:37:30,696
I remember.

1599
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:35,331
Let me at her! Let go of me!

1600
01:37:37,877 --> 01:37:40,141
Let me at her! I'll show her
whether it's a lie or not.

1601
01:37:40,346 --> 01:37:42,473
I have the proof. I have proof!

1602
01:37:42,682 --> 01:37:45,651
What proof? Please! What proof?

1603
01:37:46,586 --> 01:37:49,851
If she thinks it's a lie,
let me show her this.

1604
01:37:50,256 --> 01:37:51,621
This!

1605
01:37:55,095 --> 01:37:59,896
See for yourself.
His rose tattooed on my chest.

1606
01:38:04,604 --> 01:38:06,629
Let go of me! I'm gonna kill her!

1607
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,807
I'm gonna kill her!

1608
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:09,702
Let me get at her!

1609
01:38:09,909 --> 01:38:11,706
Let go of me!

1610
01:38:11,911 --> 01:38:14,175
Let go of me! Oh!

1611
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:16,405
Let me go!

1612
01:38:24,624 --> 01:38:26,114
Hey!

1613
01:38:26,326 --> 01:38:28,851
- That'll be 2.50, please.
- Two-fifty.

1614
01:38:29,062 --> 01:38:32,828
- Two dollars?
- Two dollars and fifty cents, yes, sir.

1615
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:37,002
Hey!

1616
01:38:41,174 --> 01:38:43,665
- What did you do?
- I smashed...

1617
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:46,277
I smashed the urn.

1618
01:38:47,247 --> 01:38:49,044
Hey, mister.

1619
01:38:49,249 --> 01:38:51,080
Two-fifty.

1620
01:38:51,484 --> 01:38:54,817
- We don't have the money.
- Well, just ask the lady.

1621
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:56,352
- The lady's sick.
- What happened?

1622
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,683
- Her husband just died.
- I'm sorry.

1623
01:38:58,892 --> 01:39:01,258
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

1624
01:39:04,531 --> 01:39:05,759
Don't look at it.

1625
01:39:06,766 --> 01:39:08,427
Don't look at it.

1626
01:39:10,937 --> 01:39:13,462
Look outside. You know?

1627
01:39:13,673 --> 01:39:15,698
Look out at the moon.

1628
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:18,605
- Yes.
- Well, look at me.

1629
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:24,206
After a while, you will stop
feeling the pain. I know.

1630
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:28,020
You need human comfort.
Lean on me.

1631
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:34,817
I don't want that.

1632
01:39:35,028 --> 01:39:37,258
What? Tell me.

1633
01:39:37,463 --> 01:39:39,226
You go now.

1634
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:41,866
- I go?
- Yeah, you go and come back.

1635
01:39:42,068 --> 01:39:44,798
But leave the truck somewhere else.

1636
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:47,301
So everybody can't hear.

1637
01:39:47,507 --> 01:39:49,236
And say to me in a loud voice:

1638
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:52,605
"Goodbye, Mrs. Delle Rose.
We had a good conversation."

1639
01:39:52,812 --> 01:39:54,177
Si, si, ho capito.

1640
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,007
I understand you very good,
baronessa.

1641
01:39:56,216 --> 01:39:58,446
- OK.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Delle Rose.

1642
01:39:58,651 --> 01:40:01,347
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye, Mr. Mangiacavallo!

1643
01:40:01,554 --> 01:40:03,215
Goodbye, Mrs. Delle Rose!

1644
01:40:03,423 --> 01:40:06,392
- Tell everybody hello!
- OK!

1645
01:40:07,227 --> 01:40:11,687
- Goodbye!
- Oh, goodbye, baronessa!

1646
01:40:16,336 --> 01:40:19,203
Give everybody my love!

1647
01:40:20,807 --> 01:40:22,240
Goodbye.

1648
01:40:25,778 --> 01:40:28,406
Give everybody my love.

1649
01:41:09,222 --> 01:41:11,281
Who's that out there?

1650
01:41:48,528 --> 01:41:50,621
Who's out there?

1651
01:42:23,396 --> 01:42:26,194
Baronessa, where are you?

1652
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:27,798
In the parlor.

1653
01:42:29,435 --> 01:42:31,096
You turned out the lights.

1654
01:42:31,304 --> 01:42:33,738
Well, the...
The moon is enough.

1655
01:42:34,073 --> 01:42:37,042
Vengo! Vengo!

1656
01:42:38,478 --> 01:42:41,743
Amore! Amore!

1657
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:49,379
What's happened?
What's happened?

1658
01:42:49,589 --> 01:42:52,524
- Hey!
- Amore. Amore.

1659
01:42:52,725 --> 01:42:53,783
You!

1660
01:42:53,993 --> 01:42:55,984
You! Hey!

1661
01:42:56,195 --> 01:42:58,959
Please! Blood?

1662
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:01,190
Whiskey.

1663
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:10,636
Get up. Get up.

1664
01:43:10,943 --> 01:43:12,968
Get up, you!

1665
01:43:15,148 --> 01:43:18,379
A clown has passed out in my house.

1666
01:43:18,584 --> 01:43:20,882
You want to sleep, huh?

1667
01:43:21,921 --> 01:43:25,413
A clown like that
with my husband's body.

1668
01:43:36,903 --> 01:43:38,234
There.

1669
01:43:56,656 --> 01:43:59,648
Go on. Don't wait for me.
I want to walk home.

1670
01:44:04,764 --> 01:44:07,255
When are you going back
to New Orleans?

1671
01:44:08,501 --> 01:44:10,025
Tomorrow.

1672
01:44:10,803 --> 01:44:12,737
What time must you be
on the boat?

1673
01:44:12,939 --> 01:44:15,430
Ship. Why?

1674
01:44:15,641 --> 01:44:17,734
Just tell me what time.

1675
01:44:18,244 --> 01:44:20,371
Five. Why?

1676
01:44:22,081 --> 01:44:24,379
What will you be doing till five?

1677
01:44:24,951 --> 01:44:26,248
Well, what difference
does it make?

1678
01:44:26,452 --> 01:44:29,717
It don't make no difference
to you what I'm gonna be doing.

1679
01:44:32,692 --> 01:44:34,023
All right.

1680
01:44:34,227 --> 01:44:36,752
All right, I'll tell you what
I'm gonna be doing till five.

1681
01:44:36,963 --> 01:44:38,487
I'm gonna check in
at the Rampart Hotel.

1682
01:44:38,698 --> 01:44:42,293
I'm gonna check in at the Rampart,
and I'm gonna get loaded.

1683
01:44:43,136 --> 01:44:45,036
Do me a little favor.

1684
01:44:46,038 --> 01:44:48,063
Before you get loaded,

1685
01:44:48,274 --> 01:44:51,243
look in the lobby of the Rampart Hotel
at 12 o'clock noon.

1686
01:44:51,444 --> 01:44:53,139
Why?

1687
01:44:53,479 --> 01:44:55,606
You might find me there...

1688
01:44:56,349 --> 01:44:58,340
...waiting for you.

1689
01:44:58,551 --> 01:45:01,520
Look, are you trying to buy me
a ten-year stretch in the brig?

1690
01:45:01,721 --> 01:45:05,817
I want you to give me the little
gold ring to put on my finger.

1691
01:45:08,561 --> 01:45:10,222
Are you talking about getting married?

1692
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:12,158
Yes.

1693
01:45:13,332 --> 01:45:19,032
Yes, I want to give you my heart
to keep forever and ever and ever.

1694
01:45:22,975 --> 01:45:26,069
In all my born days,
I never felt nothing so sweet

1695
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:29,976
as the feel of your warm
little body in my arms.

1696
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:35,177
Honey...

1697
01:45:35,888 --> 01:45:38,049
...I gotta leave now.
Do you understand?

1698
01:45:38,257 --> 01:45:41,021
Only if you promise
to be at the Rampart Hotel.

1699
01:45:41,227 --> 01:45:42,922
I gotta go, Rosa!

1700
01:45:43,129 --> 01:45:44,994
Look for me!

1701
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,265
I'll be there.

1702
01:47:40,646 --> 01:47:43,080
Che bella.

1703
01:47:55,161 --> 01:47:57,254
Che bella.

1704
01:48:09,075 --> 01:48:11,009
Sporcaccione!

1705
01:48:13,179 --> 01:48:14,669
Oh, baronessa.

1706
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,177
Baronessa!

1707
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:20,075
I didn't know what I was doing.
I got all twisted around in the house.

1708
01:48:20,986 --> 01:48:22,715
Young lady, I thought you was
your mama.

1709
01:48:22,922 --> 01:48:25,049
"Your mama"?! Oh, please!

1710
01:48:25,257 --> 01:48:27,282
- Mama. Mama, stop!
- Sporcaccione!

1711
01:48:27,493 --> 01:48:29,017
Mama!

1712
01:48:30,863 --> 01:48:33,024
- Baronessa, please!
- Don't "baronessa" me.

1713
01:48:33,232 --> 01:48:35,063
No, that's...! That's enough!

1714
01:48:35,267 --> 01:48:36,325
- I kill you!
- Stop!

1715
01:48:36,535 --> 01:48:39,003
- I kill you.
- That's enough!

1716
01:48:39,205 --> 01:48:40,331
- No. No!
- Police!

1717
01:48:41,874 --> 01:48:44,206
- Do you want everybody to know?
- Know what, cara? Know what?

1718
01:48:44,410 --> 01:48:46,139
Just give him his clothes
and let him get out!

1719
01:48:46,345 --> 01:48:47,607
- What clothes?
- I was dreaming.

1720
01:48:47,813 --> 01:48:49,303
- I didn't know...
- Don't speak to her!

1721
01:48:49,515 --> 01:48:51,380
- But, baronessa...
- Don't call me baronessa!

1722
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:53,814
Who is this man? I don't know
how this man get in...

1723
01:48:54,019 --> 01:48:56,783
Don't say anymore. Just give him
his clothes and let him get out!

1724
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:59,116
What clothes are you
talking about, huh?

1725
01:48:59,592 --> 01:49:00,820
- Get out, please!
- I'm sorry.

1726
01:49:01,026 --> 01:49:02,288
- Get out, please!
- I'm so sorry.

1727
01:49:02,495 --> 01:49:04,224
- Get... Put your shirt on!
- But, baronessa...

1728
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:07,331
- Put your shirt on, you idiot's grandson.
- Serafina, please understand.

1729
01:49:07,533 --> 01:49:09,057
You idiot's grandson, you.

1730
01:49:09,268 --> 01:49:10,633
- Don't talk to me.
- But, Serafina...

1731
01:49:10,836 --> 01:49:13,270
Don't tell me nothing, or I kill you.
I kill you!

1732
01:49:13,472 --> 01:49:16,134
- But, baronessa, I love you.
- You love me?

1733
01:49:16,342 --> 01:49:18,902
Put your shirt on! Cialtrone!

1734
01:49:19,111 --> 01:49:20,738
Cialtrone!

1735
01:49:20,946 --> 01:49:22,641
Baronessa, I love you.

1736
01:49:22,848 --> 01:49:24,873
Again?

1737
01:49:25,418 --> 01:49:29,013
Baronessa! I love you!

1738
01:49:29,789 --> 01:49:32,019
Go home. Go home!

1739
01:49:32,224 --> 01:49:34,351
Cialtrone!

1740
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:37,222
Them Italians is at it again.

1741
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:41,025
Had a truck driver
in the house all night.

1742
01:49:45,337 --> 01:49:46,827
Has the man gone?

1743
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,906
- That man?
- Yes, "that man."

1744
01:49:50,943 --> 01:49:54,379
I don't know how that man get in.
I don't know.

1745
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:57,811
- Maybe the back door was open.
- Yes, maybe it was.

1746
01:49:58,017 --> 01:50:00,178
Why not, cara? Maybe...
Maybe he climbed in a window.

1747
01:50:00,386 --> 01:50:02,877
Or fell down the chimney, maybe.

1748
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:12,224
Why do you put on the white things
I saved for your wedding, cara?

1749
01:50:12,431 --> 01:50:14,092
Because I want to.

1750
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:16,825
That's a good enough reason.

1751
01:50:17,036 --> 01:50:18,628
Rosa, darling.

1752
01:50:18,838 --> 01:50:22,069
I want you to understand
about that man, you know?

1753
01:50:22,274 --> 01:50:24,401
That was a man...

1754
01:50:24,977 --> 01:50:28,071
- That... That was...
- You can't think of a lie?

1755
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,680
He was a truck driver, cara.

1756
01:50:30,883 --> 01:50:32,111
He was chased by policemen.

1757
01:50:32,318 --> 01:50:34,343
Did they chase him
into your bedroom?

1758
01:50:34,553 --> 01:50:36,020
Bedroom?

1759
01:50:36,222 --> 01:50:37,917
In the dining room.

1760
01:50:38,457 --> 01:50:39,890
I took pity on him.

1761
01:50:40,092 --> 01:50:41,855
I gave him first aid.

1762
01:50:42,061 --> 01:50:44,723
I let him sleep on the floor.

1763
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:47,262
- He gave me his promise, you know?
- Did he get on his knees?

1764
01:50:47,466 --> 01:50:49,832
Did he promise he would
respect your innocence?

1765
01:50:50,035 --> 01:50:51,798
Did he?

1766
01:50:54,073 --> 01:50:55,597
Rosa.

1767
01:51:02,481 --> 01:51:04,608
He was Sicilian.

1768
01:51:07,419 --> 01:51:10,081
He had oil of roses in his hair.

1769
01:51:11,457 --> 01:51:14,893
And the... And the rose tattoo
of your father.

1770
01:51:16,762 --> 01:51:18,889
I closed my eyes...

1771
01:51:19,265 --> 01:51:22,291
...and dreamed he was your father.

1772
01:51:22,868 --> 01:51:27,134
But he came to me drunk,
and he fell flat down on his face.

1773
01:51:27,339 --> 01:51:29,136
Stop it!

1774
01:51:29,341 --> 01:51:32,777
The only thing worse than a liar
is a liar that's also a hypocrite!

1775
01:51:36,649 --> 01:51:38,913
Rosa, don't look at me like that, with...

1776
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:40,346
With the eyes of your father.

1777
01:51:40,553 --> 01:51:42,453
Yes, I look at you with
the eyes of my father.

1778
01:51:42,655 --> 01:51:44,589
I see you the way he saw you.

1779
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:46,018
- Don't, please.
- Like this.

1780
01:51:46,725 --> 01:51:48,693
This pig!

1781
01:51:50,062 --> 01:51:53,554
I need $5 so I can go
and find Jack.

1782
01:52:09,615 --> 01:52:10,843
Go in.

1783
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:12,950
Go in the house.

1784
01:52:13,452 --> 01:52:14,942
Thanks.

1785
01:52:24,763 --> 01:52:26,287
Rosa...

1786
01:52:26,899 --> 01:52:29,060
Rosa, I couldn't sleep.

1787
01:52:35,474 --> 01:52:37,169
My Rosa.

1788
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:38,707
Rosa.

1789
01:52:43,449 --> 01:52:47,886
My daughter, she has on the white
things I saved for her wedding.

1790
01:52:50,856 --> 01:52:52,881
Will...? Will you marry my daughter?

1791
01:52:59,898 --> 01:53:01,422
Mama.

1792
01:53:02,034 --> 01:53:04,594
That man didn't touch me.

1793
01:53:06,338 --> 01:53:08,238
He just said "che bella."

1794
01:53:10,709 --> 01:53:13,644
How beautiful she is, my daughter.

1795
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,872
Get up.

1796
01:53:17,082 --> 01:53:18,640
Go with the boy.

1797
01:53:18,851 --> 01:53:20,910
Oh, Mama.

1798
01:53:23,522 --> 01:53:26,582
Oh, don't cry. Don't cry.

1799
01:53:26,792 --> 01:53:28,191
Don't cry.

1800
01:53:28,394 --> 01:53:31,022
Don't cry. Go with the boy.

1801
01:53:31,664 --> 01:53:33,529
Go with the boy.

1802
01:53:48,647 --> 01:53:50,547
The wristwatch.

1803
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:52,608
Oh, my.

1804
01:53:54,019 --> 01:53:55,611
Rosa!

1805
01:53:56,755 --> 01:53:58,382
Rosa!

1806
01:54:00,492 --> 01:54:02,323
The wristwatch.

1807
01:54:09,168 --> 01:54:11,728
Rondinella felice!

1808
01:54:11,937 --> 01:54:14,735
Rondinella felice!

1809
01:54:16,008 --> 01:54:18,238
I'm a happy bird!

1810
01:54:18,444 --> 01:54:21,004
Rondinella felice!

1811
01:54:21,213 --> 01:54:24,671
- Rondinella felice!
- Serafina!

1812
01:54:24,883 --> 01:54:27,113
- Serafina Delle Rose!
- Baronessa!

1813
01:54:27,319 --> 01:54:28,980
Baronessa Delle Rose!

1814
01:54:29,188 --> 01:54:31,315
There is a man on the roof
without no shirt!

1815
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:33,555
Si, si. Senza camicia!

1816
01:54:33,759 --> 01:54:36,125
All he's got on his chest
is a rose tattoo!

1817
01:54:36,328 --> 01:54:38,694
Come on, Serafina. Why do you
wanna lock up his shirt like that?

1818
01:54:38,897 --> 01:54:42,094
So he can't go to the high school?
Come on!

1819
01:54:42,301 --> 01:54:44,667
- Serafina!
- Brava, Serafina!

1820
01:54:47,973 --> 01:54:51,170
Here is a silk shirt for him!

1821
01:54:51,376 --> 01:54:53,105
OK?

1822
01:55:04,423 --> 01:55:08,154
I'm a happy bird!

1823
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:24,240
Va!

1824
01:55:37,689 --> 01:55:38,917
Baronessa?

1825
01:55:47,466 --> 01:55:49,366
Serafina?

1826
01:56:08,153 --> 01:56:11,316
Now we can go on
with our conversation.
