1
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:41,560
- Pardon me. I don't mean to be rude...
- No talk.

2
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:45,566
- You mean I no talk or you no talk?
- I mean you no talk to me.

3
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,567
I just like to sketch...

4
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:51,401
- You want me to call officer?
- Well, won't you please allow...?

5
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:00,344
Oh, thank you. I'll give it to her.

6
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:12,928
Officer!

7
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,597
Officer.

8
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:17,734
- Yes, miss?
- This man steal my purse.

9
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,203
Now, wait a minute.
I didn't steal your purse.

10
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,066
- I was just...
- Arrest him.

11
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,205
He follow me everywhere on ferry
just to get my purse.

12
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,038
- Are you out of your mind?
- Did you take purse?

13
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,941
- Of course I didn't.
- Arrest him.

14
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,480
There was a lady sitting
down there, and she...

15
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:36,551
Here she is. Madam.

16
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,245
Would you explain
about the purse?

17
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:41,254
I bring back.

18
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,892
- Yeah.
- I think you make mistake, miss.

19
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,299
This lady say you left purse on seat.

20
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:57,371
There, you see.

21
00:05:58,342 --> 00:06:00,867
I report this to my father.

22
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,142
Thank you very much.
Thank you too.

23
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:06,908
- Sorry about mistake, sir.
- It's all right.

24
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,784
- Well, that's appreciation.
- No talk.

25
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:14,219
I should've left your purse.
Serve you right.

26
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,985
Why you not explain?
Why you let me call officer?

27
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,525
You cause me trouble.

28
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,856
You almost got me arrested.

29
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,555
Is your fault.

30
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,598
No talk.

31
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,130
Wait.

32
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,168
Everything here. You can go now.

33
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:38,608
You don't think I took anything?

34
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,545
Not now. Money all here.

35
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,620
You're the most exasperating girl
I've ever met.

36
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,483
We not meet. I no talk to strangers.

37
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:51,060
Yes, I know. That's where we came in.
"No talk, no talk."

38
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,157
No talk?

39
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:00,432
You sailor?

40
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,328
A sailor? Why?

41
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,475
My father say, "Sailors catch
too many girls.

42
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,304
"You talk to sailor, I beat you."

43
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,208
If that's what's bothering you,
no, I'm not a sailor.

44
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,883
Then I talk. What are you?

45
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:16,679
I'm an artist.

46
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:19,412
In China, artists very respected.

47
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:21,818
Not where I come from.

48
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,620
- You American?
- Yes.

49
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:26,626
Me Chinese.

50
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,298
No kidding?

51
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:30,364
My name's Mee Ling.

52
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:32,035
Mee Ling.

53
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:34,466
My name's Robert Lomax.

54
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:36,765
You live in Hong Kong?

55
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,805
Oh, I live many places.

56
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,840
Sometime on Peak.

57
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,979
Sometime at Repulse Bay.

58
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,841
My father very rich, you know.

59
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,609
He has... four houses.

60
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:50,378
Well, I'm honored
that you'll talk to me.

61
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,352
So you artist, huh?

62
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:55,887
When I get married, maybe my father
have you paint picture of me.

63
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:57,924
- You're going to get married?
- Yes.

64
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,121
I go to America next month
to marry rich Chinese.

65
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:03,427
Hope I like him.

66
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,663
You've never met him?

67
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,430
That's not important.
I obey my father.

68
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,869
Contract's already signed.

69
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,134
Well, I know it's
an old Chinese custom,

70
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:15,642
but I could never marry
anyone I hadn't met.

71
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:19,111
Oh, you not Chinese. I not American.

72
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:21,746
I hear of one English girl

73
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:23,214
who lives on Peak

74
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,820
had four boyfriends in four months

75
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,355
and then married number five.

76
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:32,518
Chinese girl must be pure when
she marries. Chinese girl must be...

77
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,530
What is that word in English for girl
who never make love?

78
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:40,898
- Well, there are lots of words.
- No, I mean girl who never make love.

79
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:43,232
What is word?

80
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,467
Virgin! Yes, virgin. That's me.

81
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:50,339
Is something to be ashamed of?

82
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,239
No, but it's not the kind of thing
one shouts on a ferry boat.

83
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,887
Oh, I proud to be good girl.

84
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:00,556
I'm proud that you're proud.

85
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,187
We Hong Kong side now.

86
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:27,808
So I'm not going to
see you again, huh?

87
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:29,246
Why?

88
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:32,889
- Well, I haven't finished my sketch.
- Please, no talk.

89
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,614
My father send car to meet me.

90
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,555
Driver see me talk to stranger,
he tell my father.

91
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,251
Oh, I see.

92
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:41,431
OK. Goodbye.

93
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,557
Wait.

94
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,598
Goodbye.

95
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:50,072
I hope someday you be famous artist.

96
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:04,077
Mee Ling, virgin.

97
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:55,366
Wan Chai is that way.
But this is for Chinese, sir.

98
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,006
Can you recommend
a cheap hotel there?

99
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,642
Excuse me, but it is not for you, sir.

100
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:03,176
People there are very poor, sir.

101
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,838
- We'll have a lot in common.
- I suggest that you take a ricksha.

102
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,712
I like to walk.

103
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:10,948
Thank you, sir.

104
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,785
Mee Ling!

105
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:54,446
- Hello.
- Yes, yes. Very sorry.

106
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:55,982
- You wish something?
- Yes.

107
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:58,484
That girl that just left,
I tried to catch her.

108
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,520
- Did you see her?
- No. No notice.

109
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,585
Her name is Mee Ling.

110
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,528
Mee Ling? Know nobody
named Mee Ling.

111
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:09,026
Her father probably owns this building.
He's very rich.

112
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:11,360
Do you know the man
who owns this place?

113
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:14,429
Yes. Ah Tong. That's me.

114
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,467
Oh. Well, thanks.

115
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:19,904
Very sorry. Very sorry.

116
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,577
This is a hotel, isn't it?

117
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,405
Yes. Very good hotel.

118
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,443
Do you have monthly terms?

119
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:27,742
You want a room for a whole month?

120
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,418
Yes. Can you give me a price?

121
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:31,714
Yes, sir.

122
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:35,887
I want an inexpensive room.

123
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:37,924
I make you special rate.

00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:41,129

125
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:44,664
- Two hundred and seventy dollars?
- Hong Kong dollar. No American.

126
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,096
Oh, sure.

127
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,703
Now, let's see, what is that?
That's...

128
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:50,498
...fifty dollars a month.

129
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:52,538
All right, I'll take a look at it.

130
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:55,007
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

131
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:58,109
I give you best room in the hotel.

132
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,546
- You want to stay for a whole month?
- Maybe.

133
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:07,152
Very nice room. Best room in the hotel.

00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,818
Everything... How you say?

You can use private balcony.

00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,726
Very cool breeze. Plenty hot water.

138
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:22,497
Beer in the bar, no mosquitoes.
Very quiet.

Free soap.
And very nice view on roof.

142
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:34,216
- Oh, roof. Good.
- On roof, yes. You like?

143
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:38,047
Yes, this is perfect for my work.

00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:39,882
Yes.

145
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,024
Understand now.

146
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:44,786
- Understand what?
- Nothing, sir. Nothing.

147
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:47,828
My name Ah Tong.
You please correct my bad English.

148
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,555
There's nothing to correct.

149
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,927
- Thank you, sir.
- You said that was 250...

150
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:54,603

- Seventy.

151
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:57,467
- OK, I'll take it.
- Thank you. You're very kind.

152
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:59,938
Artist for whole month.

153
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:01,701
Whole month.

154
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,499
Oh, excuse me. Is Minni Ho in here?

155
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:07,074
- I'm afraid you've got the wrong room.
- Sorry.

156
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:14,344
Oh, excuse me, is Minni Ho in here?

157
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:18,579
Afraid you've got
the wrong room.

158
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,019
Yeah, that's for sure.

159
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,872
Come on, darling. You hold on to me.

160
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:43,840
Hey.

161
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,481
Hey. Where you going now?

162
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,878
I left my watch on the table
in my room.

163
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:51,680
I go with you and help you wind it.

164
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:53,913
Good girl.

165
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,927
Oh, sorry. It must be navy day.

166
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:00,028
Always is at the Nam Kok, mate.

167
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,097
- Come on, Minni Ho.
- Oh, you're Minni Ho.

168
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,562
You know me?

169
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:07,032
No. I've heard of you.

170
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,101
You satisfied, Mr. Lomax?

171
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:13,936
I'm not sure.

172
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,576
- I'm sure.
- This very respectable hotel.

173
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:25,914
Not brothel. Brothel illegal
in Hong Kong.

174
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:27,522
Obey law here.

175
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:29,191
Only rent rooms.

176
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,790
This bar not belong to me.

177
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:33,428
I suppose you have to draw the line
somewhere.

178
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,121
And the line, I guess, is right here.

179
00:18:52,816 --> 00:18:55,250
- Yes, sir?
- A beer, please.

180
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:18,865
A dollar twenty, please.

181
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,168
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

182
00:19:57,581 --> 00:20:00,243
You draw my friend, Wednesday Lu.

183
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,783
You must be artist who rent room
for whole month.

184
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:06,182
Well, I didn't mean to start a scandal.

185
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:09,449
- Won't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you.

186
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:12,321
- My name is Gwenny Lee.
- I'm Robert Lomax.

187
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:13,962
Hello, Robert.

188
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:15,961
- Robert.
- Yes, Robert.

189
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:20,735
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

190
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,146
Oh, please not draw me.
I'm too skinny.

191
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,217
That's why I wear long sleeves,
to hide skinny arms.

192
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:38,277
A lot of men like thin girls.

193
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,782
No, I have no sex appeal.

194
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:42,786
Oh, I'm sure you have.

195
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,257
It's better if I take my glasses off.

196
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:47,726
Only then, I bump into people.

197
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:50,297
That might have advantages.

198
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,434
That's how I met my friend, Chuck.

199
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:55,469
You like that name? Chuck?

200
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,833
It's good and sturdy.

201
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:00,541
I had a nice letter from him
when he went away.

202
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:03,406
- Would you like to read it?
- I don't think I should.

203
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:05,478
I read it, then.

204
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,180
"Dear Gwenny:

205
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:09,375
"Well, don't die of shock.

206
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:13,454
"I expect you will, to get a letter
after all this time.

207
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:16,683
"Anyhow, I want you to know

208
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:19,794
"I remember you
and think about you a lot.

209
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,290
"I sure was lucky
meeting a girl like you,

210
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,468
"because, well, Gwenny,

211
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:28,769
"you really are a swell girl.

212
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:30,837
"So don't die of shock."

213
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,306
And then he signs his name.
"Chuck."

214
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:35,808
He's very well-educated.

215
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,203
And obviously devoted.

216
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,683
Now, that proves you have sex appeal.

217
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:44,151
Maybe. You see, he wore glasses too.

218
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:06,937
Excuse me a moment.

219
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,078
Hello, Mee Ling.

220
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:18,643
You speak to me?

221
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:21,346
Don't you remember,
Kowloon Ferry this morning?

222
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:24,186
I think you make mistake.
I never ride ferry.

223
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:25,992
I couldn't have.

224
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:28,854
When I draw a face, I remember it.

225
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,061
Sure looks like you.

226
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,168
To Americans, all Chinese
look alike, for goodness' sake.

227
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:36,101
That's not me.

228
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:39,503
My name Suzie Wong.
I never see you before.

229
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,403
Leave us alone, please.

230
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,909
No talk, huh?

231
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:49,885
What you say?

232
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:51,314
Oh, nothing.

233
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,079
Sorry.

234
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:02,326
You see the girl sitting there at the bar,
with the red dress?

235
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:04,966
Yes, Suzie Wong. She my best friend.

236
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:06,658
Most popular girl in bar.

237
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,303
She got sex appeal.

238
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:11,065
Yes. Well, is she ever called
Mee Ling?

239
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:14,641
No. Everybody call Suzie "Suzie".

240
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:18,243
She's got a sister
she doesn't know about.

241
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:22,014
I'm here, doll.

242
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:23,651
Oh, hello, Otis.

243
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:26,378
This is Otis. Meet my friend, Robert.

244
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:28,523
- What was the name?
- Bob Lomax.

245
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:31,785
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
- Why don't you sit?

246
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,223
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

247
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

248
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:36,829
What a nice fellow.

249
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:40,560
I'm sorry I'm late, but I got stuck
in a ricksha down the road.

250
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:10,998
Why you look at picture?
She your girlfriend?

251
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,169
No, someone I'd like to find again.

252
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,633
Why? You crazy mad for her?

253
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:18,499
She was dear, sweet and innocent.

254
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,233
That's not me. I'm just Wan Chai girl.

255
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:25,312
What a nice girl you meet on ferry
doing in a place like this I like to know.

256
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:27,210
So would I.

257
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,409
Glad you haven't lost your purse.
"You want me call officer?

258
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,579
"I virgin. I proud. We on
Hong Kong side now. No talk."

259
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,821
I sure fooled you.

260
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,291
I made you believe I nice rich girl.

261
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:42,727
- Why?
- I like.

262
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,565
You looking for girlfriend?

263
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,432
I hear you rent room
for whole month.

264
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:51,698
You want me to be
your regular girlfriend?

265
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:54,610
I like, but can't afford.

266
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,645
Too bad, because I very popular.

267
00:24:57,847 --> 00:25:01,613
Everybody say, "Where is Suzie,
for goodness' sake?"

268
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,645
You sure you not want me
for permanent girlfriend?

269
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,723
I'll fight it for a while.

270
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:12,327
You sorry because I'm not that
stuck-up girl on ferry boat.

271
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:15,354
Month a long time in Hong Kong.

272
00:25:15,565 --> 00:25:18,261
I wait. You'll get Ionely.

273
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,212
Mr. Lomax.

274
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:10,847
Mr. Lomax.

275
00:26:11,054 --> 00:26:12,783
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

276
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,287
I've been expecting you
since I got that letter

277
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,119
from your former associates.
When did you arrive?

278
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:21,559
- Well, sit down, won't you?
- Oh, thank you. Just yesterday.

279
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:23,493
I wanted to get settled.

280
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,601
I gather from this letter
you want to become an artist.

281
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,670
I don't know how I can help you.

282
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:31,204
Well, neither do l, sir.

283
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:34,433
You look more like an aggressive
businessman than an artist.

284
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:38,171
That's the trouble. I've been
an architect most of my life,

285
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:39,939
but it never satisfied me.

286
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:43,141
I've always wanted to paint,
so I decided to take a year off

287
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,583
- And see if I could.
- Seems a drastic step.

288
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:48,113
Yes, it is.

289
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:50,349
I'm going to open an account here

290
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,290
which should take care of my
expenses for about a year.

291
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:56,988
During that time, I intend to find out
whether I can make a living.

292
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,430
If not, I'll go back
to being a draftsman.

293
00:26:59,636 --> 00:27:00,864
Fair enough.

294
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,300
I'll give you letters of introduction

295
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:06,339
- And a guest card to my club.
- That's very kind of you.

296
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,409
Come in, darling. I want to
dictate a couple of letters.

297
00:27:09,612 --> 00:27:11,273
All right, dear.

298
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:14,445
Mr. Lomax, before we jump
to any conclusions,

299
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:16,710
my secretary is also my daughter.

300
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,047
- Kay, Mr. Lomax.
- Hello.

301
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:21,155
He's over here for a year, painting.

302
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:23,052
- Just arrived.
- Welcome.

303
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:25,750
- Thank you.
- Have you found somewhere to stay?

304
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:27,862
I stumbled onto a hotel.

305
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,292
Is it comfortable?

306
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:31,228
It's... convenient.

307
00:27:31,434 --> 00:27:35,234
If you don't mind waiting, I'll dictate
letters that might come in handy.

308
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:36,803
Thank you.

309
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:40,134
To whom it may concern.

310
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:44,704
Whenever you're ready, dear.

311
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:49,275
- Oh, yes.
- This is to introduce Robert Lomax.

312
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,568
You like me to sit with you?

313
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,806
Yes, yes, why not? Yes, please
sit down. I'd be delighted.

314
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,501
- What's your name?
- Ben.

315
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:19,045
It's short for Benjamin, you know.

316
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:22,581
My wife calls me Benjie for spite.

317
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:25,345
You like me?

318
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:28,183
Like you? Oh, yes, of course I like you.

319
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:30,689
Yes, I adore you.

320
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,684
Might I ask your name, please?

321
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:36,854
- I'm Suzie.
- Suzie. That's a very pretty name.

322
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:40,194
That is a scintillating sound.
It buzzes. Suzie.

323
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:43,463
- You're very nice.
- Oh, thank you. What will you have?

324
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:46,641
What was that again?

325
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:50,203
Oh, I see. Well, may I have
another double?

326
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:53,405
Betsy won't let me drink
doubles at home.

327
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:56,949
She should see where it's driven
me to now. It might give her...

328
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:01,321
...rather a shock, mightn't it?

329
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:17,967
Robert!

330
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:23,876
- Hello, Gwenny.
- So glad you come along.

331
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,911
You take me in bar, please?

332
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:30,211
- Well, can't you go in by yourself?
- Against law to go in bar alone.

333
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,117
- Oh. Where's your boyfriend?
- Gone back to ship.

334
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:38,555
- Well, in that case, care to join me?
- Oh, thank you very much.

335
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:46,661
Everything very legal now.
Thank you, Robert.

336
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,694
Beer, please.

337
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:52,706
Don't you get tired
of knitting all the time?

338
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,173
Oh, no. Someday I open knitting shop.

339
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:57,437
I not stay here. Not good.

340
00:29:57,647 --> 00:29:59,877
All I need is enough money.

341
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,483
All anybody needs is enough money.

342
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:05,245
Anything I can do for you, Robert?

343
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:09,391
- Yes. Knit me a pair of socks.
- Will do.

344
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,991
I hope you'll believe me when I tell you

345
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:20,898
I've never done this sort of thing.
I've been faithfully married 12 years.

346
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:22,901
Isn't that extraordinary?

347
00:30:23,106 --> 00:30:25,438
You're not different.
Most men here married.

348
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:28,508
- Most of the fellows here married?
- Mind if we dance?

349
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:30,770
I don't dance.
Thank you just the same.

350
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,675
I mean Suzie.

351
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:36,045
Well, I mean, yes, of course.
Well, run along, run along then.

352
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:39,710
- Don't go away, Ben.
- No, no, I'll be here waiting for you.

353
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:06,625
- Ah Tong?
- Yes, Mr. Lomax.

354
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:09,396
Right away, Mr. Lomax.

355
00:33:40,036 --> 00:33:41,663
Ben...

356
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,114
For goodness' sake.

357
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,310
Ben...

358
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,608
Come in.

359
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:38,427
You want me?

360
00:34:39,095 --> 00:34:40,722
That's right.

361
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,232
I very glad.

362
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:51,737
Why you ask for me?

363
00:34:52,408 --> 00:34:55,844
Well, you're easily the prettiest girl
in Hong Kong.

364
00:34:56,912 --> 00:34:58,470
You think so?

365
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,411
I thought so from the first moment
I saw you.

366
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:10,625
I can't pay you much,

367
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:13,727
but I'd like to have you
pose for me.

368
00:35:14,497 --> 00:35:17,295
Pose? What you mean, pose?

369
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,367
Oh, just sit while I sketch you.

370
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,936
Just sit? That's all?

371
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:24,697
Until you get tired.

372
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:27,034
No. Sorry, I go now.

373
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:29,734
Now, wait a minute.
I said I'd pay you.

374
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:32,209
That's not important. I lose face.

375
00:35:32,415 --> 00:35:34,383
My friends will say,
"For goodness' sake,

376
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,414
"you go to gentleman's room and sit?"

377
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:39,713
"Well, for goodness' sake,"
they'll say, "you're slipping."

378
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:41,787
- No, I go.
- If you go back now,

379
00:35:41,991 --> 00:35:44,289
they'll say you're slipping anyhow,
won't they?

380
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,825
Yes.

381
00:35:48,164 --> 00:35:50,223
Now see the trouble
you caused me already?

382
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:54,028
You might as well wait a bit, and
while you wait you might as well pose.

383
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,830
They'll never know the difference.

384
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:01,639
OK, I pose for you.

385
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:04,869
Good. Right over here.

386
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,707
Take clothes off?

387
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,510
No, I've never tried nudes.

388
00:36:09,718 --> 00:36:11,310
Good time to try.

389
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,891
I'm much more interested in those
lovely high cheekbones of yours.

390
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,319
You like bones?

391
00:36:17,526 --> 00:36:20,256
I like yours. Legs up.

392
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:25,530
For goodness' sake.

393
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:31,663
This OK?

394
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:26,219
You want to know what song say?

395
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,055
Yes, but don't move.

396
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,497
Well, it's about a boy cloud

397
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:37,433
who falls in love with a girl cloud.

398
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:41,442
But the girl cloud say,
"You no good.

399
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,134
"You not got good heart.

400
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,744
"Go away."

401
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:50,444
So the boy cloud feel very sad,

402
00:37:50,653 --> 00:37:52,814
and he start to cry.

403
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:55,849
And his tears make rain

404
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:57,548
because that's all rain is.

405
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,523
Suzie.

406
00:37:59,728 --> 00:38:01,889
And the rain fell down,

407
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:04,531
and then everything started
to grow

408
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:07,668
and is green, and there is food

409
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,804
and everybody's happy.

410
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:12,633
So the girl cloud tell the boy cloud,

411
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:16,777
"You did good thing.
You got good heart."

412
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:20,210
- So in the end, they get married.
- And rain happily ever after.

413
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:22,945
You not believe?

414
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:27,022
It was a charming song,
and you sang it beautifully.

415
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,281
- Is finished?
- Oh, no, a long way to go.

416
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:31,186
Want to take a look?

417
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:41,059
I like it very much,
but not look like me.

418
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,828
It's what I think you look like.

419
00:38:43,038 --> 00:38:45,666
That's the difference between
an artist and a camera.

420
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:48,138
An artist always tries to look deeper.

421
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:49,606
You know, Robert,

422
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:52,576
Chinese people believe if you have
picture of a person,

423
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:54,271
person never free of you.

424
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:58,783
Don't worry, Suzie, I don't think your
soul is that easy to capture on canvas.

425
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:05,322
Suzie!

426
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:07,552
For goodness' sake, how you find me?

427
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,754
- I knocked on every door...
- A friend?

428
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:12,798
Hong Kong businessman named Ben.
I leave him in bar.

429
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:14,594
Drink too much.

430
00:39:14,803 --> 00:39:16,532
Oh, thank you, Ben.

431
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,377
My name's Lomax.

432
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,514
How do you do?

433
00:39:27,082 --> 00:39:29,107
Excuse me...

434
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:39,690
Well, I'm starved.
You wanna have some dinner?

435
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:41,385
What do we do with Ben?

436
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:43,895
That's very simple.

437
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:48,464
Ah Tong,

438
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:51,139
there's a man in my room.

439
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:04,880
Good evening, sir.

440
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:06,384
- Reservation?
- Mr. Drake.

441
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:07,816
Oh, yes.

442
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:10,884
This very fancy, stuck-up place.

443
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:14,756
- You got money?
- And a letter of introduction.

444
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:17,431
- Good evening. I'm Mr. Lomax.
- Reservation?

445
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:19,692
No, but I have a letter
from Mr. O'Neill.

446
00:40:19,902 --> 00:40:22,234
Oh, yes, Mr. O'Neill mentioned it.

447
00:40:23,472 --> 00:40:25,167
Table 2 1.

448
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:26,966
Thank you.

449
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,579
Robert, what is letter of introduction?

450
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:34,112
Oh, it's sort of a welcome.

451
00:40:34,316 --> 00:40:36,477
Gets me into places where
I'm not known.

452
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,118
What this letter say?

453
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,185
It says, "To whom it may concern."

454
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:42,016
You just show letter?

455
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:43,657
That's all.

456
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,417
For goodness' sake.

457
00:40:45,627 --> 00:40:49,393
- Would you care for a drink first, sir?
- Yes. Suzie?

458
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:54,426
I'll take this.

459
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:57,972
- Sherry flip.
- Sherry flip.

460
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:01,842
Make it two.

461
00:41:03,145 --> 00:41:06,308
You might as well take our order now.

462
00:41:06,515 --> 00:41:08,380
What would you like?

463
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:14,619
You bring me this, please.

464
00:41:15,357 --> 00:41:16,619
Vinaigrette.

465
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:19,020
Vinaigrette, miss. What with?

466
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:21,261
Nothing.

467
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:23,055
I not very hungry.

468
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:25,927
- Make it two.
- It's a salad dressing, sir.

469
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:27,534
Usually served with a salad.

470
00:41:28,337 --> 00:41:30,498
We know. We like it plain.

471
00:41:30,706 --> 00:41:35,439
Suzie, how about some sole meuniere
and braised celery?

472
00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:38,943
- If you want.
- For two.

473
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,817
So you like sherry flips, huh?

474
00:41:44,953 --> 00:41:47,513
I always have sherry flip at home.

475
00:41:47,723 --> 00:41:50,191
My father very rich, you know.

476
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:53,757
Tell me, why do you make up
all that nonsense?

477
00:41:54,496 --> 00:41:57,522
It makes me feel good to pretend
I'm somebody important.

478
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:59,928
I ride on ferry, and I say,

479
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:04,128
"I Mee Ling Wong,
nice girl with rich father."

480
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,237
But I not expect you to understand.

481
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,070
You never have to do dirty job like me.

482
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:14,677
I suppose it's the usual
stupid question,

483
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,317
- But why do you?
- What else I do?

484
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:19,282
Hong Kong full of hungry people.

485
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:22,116
No one hire me.
Never learn how to read or write,

486
00:42:22,324 --> 00:42:23,552
even in Chinese.

487
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:26,184
That's why I point to menu.

488
00:42:26,395 --> 00:42:29,091
Not want you to lose face
in front of stuck-up waiter.

489
00:42:29,665 --> 00:42:31,030
You can't read or write?

490
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:33,224
No one ever teach me.

491
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:36,768
When I was ten years old,
old aunt take me to old uncle to live.

492
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:40,373
He say, "You do everything I ask."
I very scared.

493
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:42,370
I cry, but he not care.

494
00:42:42,578 --> 00:42:43,909
Then he throw me out.

495
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:48,214
Not good for Chinese wife anymore.
Not good for anything.

496
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:51,386
What you think ignorant ten-year-old
Chinese girl will do?

497
00:42:52,254 --> 00:42:53,721
I'm sorry I asked.

498
00:42:53,922 --> 00:42:56,390
But I not dirty street-girl.

499
00:42:56,758 --> 00:42:59,591
Inside, I still good.

500
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:05,229
Your sherry flips.

501
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,565
Thank you.

502
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:21,145
Would you rather dance?

503
00:43:49,177 --> 00:43:50,644
Hello, Mr. Lomax.

504
00:43:50,846 --> 00:43:52,507
I see you've taken my suggestion.

505
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:53,976
Oh, good evening, sir.

506
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:56,377
- Painting the town first?
- Yes.

507
00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:01,414
Oh, Miss Suzie Wong,
this is Mr. O'Neill

508
00:44:01,623 --> 00:44:03,523
and his daughter, Miss Kay O'Neill.

509
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,158
Hello.

510
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,022
You seem to manage very well
on your own.

511
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,630
This is Dr. And Mrs. Hendricks,
Mr. Lomax.

512
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:13,733
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

513
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:16,461
- Well, nice seeing you.
- Oh, Mr. Lomax...

514
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:19,004
Have you an evening free
for dinner next week?

515
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:21,698
- Certainly.
- Where did you say you were staying?

516
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,309
The Nam Kok Hotel.

517
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,770
Thank you. I'll look it up in the book.

518
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:29,246
- Nice to have met you, Miss Wong.
- Pleasure.

519
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:32,511
Nice meeting you. Goodbye.

520
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:36,848
She very pretty girl.

521
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:38,526
You like her?

522
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:40,354
I hardly know her.

523
00:44:40,562 --> 00:44:41,961
You going to her house?

524
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:43,995
She'll probably forget all about it.

525
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:45,564
She not forget.

526
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,564
She virgin?

527
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:52,704
- Well, if you'd wait a minute, I'll ask.
- Never mind. You'll find out.

528
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:02,481
Your vinaigrettes.

529
00:45:05,887 --> 00:45:08,185
Suzie, don't eat it alone.
It's far too sour.

530
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,618
Let me get you a salad.

531
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:12,385
No, I eat. Not waste money.

532
00:45:12,594 --> 00:45:15,586
Mustn't let waiter find out I can't read.
You lose face.

533
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,788
I couldn't care less.

534
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,358
You know, Robert,
you like boy cloud in song.

535
00:45:22,571 --> 00:45:25,563
The one that cries on everybody?

536
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:28,140
You got good heart.

537
00:45:48,764 --> 00:45:51,790
No! I not go back to bar.

538
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:56,268
- Do you want me to take you home?
- No.

539
00:45:56,471 --> 00:45:57,802
Well, what, then?

540
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:00,998
I have to get scarf I leave in your room.

541
00:46:02,244 --> 00:46:05,304
Now, wait a minute, Suzie.
I don't remember any scarf.

542
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:08,244
Oh, beautiful scarf. Go with dress.

543
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,044
Cost 30 Hong Kong dollar.

544
00:46:11,253 --> 00:46:13,050
We'd better get it, then.

545
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:19,290
Now, where I leave scarf?

546
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:24,424
Not under chair.

547
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:26,625
Not under bed.

548
00:46:26,968 --> 00:46:28,663
Not on floor.

549
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,360
Not here, for goodness' sake.

550
00:46:31,773 --> 00:46:33,468
You're sure you had a scarf?

551
00:46:37,179 --> 00:46:39,477
No, I leave home.

552
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,011
I just wanted to come up
to room with you.

553
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:49,922
Well, you can just hippety-hop
right back to the bar

554
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:52,559
because I'm going to go to bed.

555
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,321
You not want me to pose even?

556
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,828
Tomorrow, Suzie.
Come back tomorrow.

557
00:46:58,633 --> 00:47:01,864
Robert, you like me as much
as English girl?

558
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:03,732
You have better bones.

559
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:06,430
If you want, I stay.

560
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:08,336
I'll be your permanent girlfriend.

561
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,138
Never go out with other boyfriends.
Take good care of you.

562
00:47:12,881 --> 00:47:15,577
Suzie, you're very attractive,
and I'm only human.

563
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:19,880
But unfortunately, there's no provision
for anyone like you in my budget.

564
00:47:21,556 --> 00:47:23,786
With you, it's different.

565
00:47:23,992 --> 00:47:26,688
I feel something in heart.

566
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:30,826
It's like pretending I rich girl.

567
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:44,873
What do you want?

568
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,210
Oh, excuse me there, buddy.
I guess I got the wrong room.

569
00:47:58,193 --> 00:47:59,421
Good night, Suzie.

570
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:09,035
Thank you for sherry flip
and salad dressing, Robert.

571
00:48:09,237 --> 00:48:12,400
Sorry you not know
how to accept present too.

572
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:04,822
Hi, soldier.

573
00:49:05,627 --> 00:49:07,652
Hi, sailor.

574
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:14,198
Sailor?

575
00:49:14,402 --> 00:49:16,427
Sailor.

576
00:49:16,638 --> 00:49:19,266
- Going in bar, sailor?
- Well, I wasn't planning to.

577
00:49:19,474 --> 00:49:21,965
Would you like to take me inside,
please?

578
00:49:22,177 --> 00:49:24,737
Sounds like a good idea.

579
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,557
Goodbye, and thank you.

580
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:39,693
Hey, wait a minute.
What do you mean, "goodbye"?

581
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,828
You asked me to bring you in here.

582
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,295
Now I'm in. Thank you very much.

583
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,339
Suzie?

584
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:54,601
Full-time girlfriend.

585
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:56,470
He's crazy about me.

586
00:49:56,678 --> 00:49:58,509
Already he's jealous when I go away.

587
00:49:58,713 --> 00:50:00,738
Shouldn't come into bar
with sailor then.

588
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:03,884
- Just wanted to say hello to you.
- You very lucky, Suzie.

589
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,780
Why not? Suzie very beautiful.

590
00:50:05,987 --> 00:50:08,854
Robert think so,
and he very important artist.

591
00:50:09,057 --> 00:50:10,786
Paint plenty pictures.

592
00:50:10,992 --> 00:50:13,256
Get, oh, $2,000 each painting.

593
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:14,723
Two thousand dollars!

594
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,328
Maybe more.

595
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:19,125
Well, I better go up now.
He like me on time.

596
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:24,362
My goodness, he's so jealous.
If I not hurry, he beat me up.

597
00:50:27,475 --> 00:50:29,340
Just a minute.

598
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,512
- Hello.
- Oh, Suzie,

599
00:50:36,718 --> 00:50:40,210
I didn't know how to get in touch
with you. I won't need you tonight.

600
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:41,719
You going somewhere?

601
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:43,288
Yes, I...

602
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:45,015
I've been invited to dinner.

603
00:50:45,226 --> 00:50:47,091
I told you she not forget.

604
00:50:50,098 --> 00:50:51,497
Rich people buy paintings.

605
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,066
Now, if you don't mind,
I've got to get dressed.

606
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:56,897
Go ahead. I stay.

607
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:59,005
If I go downstairs now, I lose face.

608
00:50:59,207 --> 00:51:02,574
Suzie, you don't understand.
I've got to put my pants on.

609
00:51:02,777 --> 00:51:05,473
Pants on, pants off,
makes no difference.

610
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,841
All right.

611
00:51:11,252 --> 00:51:14,449
You very skinny.
Why you not eat more pork?

612
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:19,320
Since you're not my girlfriend, you're
not to make remarks about my legs.

613
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:21,825
My goodness, you very bony.

614
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:25,261
If you change your mind,
let me know. I'll get you fat.

615
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:30,895
- How long you be out tonight?
- I don't know.

616
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:32,734
I wait.

617
00:51:32,941 --> 00:51:35,671
Suzie, I will not feel like sketching
when I come back.

618
00:51:35,877 --> 00:51:37,708
I bet.

619
00:51:37,912 --> 00:51:40,107
I'll wait anyhow.

620
00:51:43,985 --> 00:51:46,215
Zip up, Robert.

621
00:52:14,516 --> 00:52:16,916
- I won't need a heavy coat?
- No, it's lovely.

622
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:19,712
- It's even warm enough for bathing.
- Excuse me,

623
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:22,389
but I think we've met before,
you know.

624
00:52:23,992 --> 00:52:25,220
It's that kind of face.

625
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:28,794
No, no. Once I've met someone,
I never forget them. Do l, Bets?

626
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:33,200
You can't have met him.
He just came to Hong Kong.

627
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:34,868
Mr. Lomax is here to paint.

628
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,832
Oh, an artist.

629
00:52:37,038 --> 00:52:38,869
There's some area of disagreement.

630
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:41,574
Do you paint portraits?

631
00:52:41,776 --> 00:52:43,676
At the moment
I'm completely fascinated

632
00:52:43,878 --> 00:52:45,846
by the wonderful Oriental faces.

633
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:50,677
Oh, the Chinese, you mean.
Yes, they are fascinating, at first.

634
00:52:50,885 --> 00:52:54,286
Be best to keep your nose clean
out here. If you want to be accepted

635
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:57,356
- By your own people.
- That's a dubious privilege.

636
00:52:57,559 --> 00:52:59,356
Oh, don't be hypocritical.

637
00:52:59,561 --> 00:53:03,190
You know their moral standards
are quite different. Aren't they?

638
00:53:03,398 --> 00:53:04,990
Oh, yes. Yes, they are.

639
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,168
Would you want your sister
to marry one?

640
00:53:07,368 --> 00:53:08,596
- Oh, I say.
- She did.

641
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:15,506
Happened soon after
we came out here.

642
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,679
They live in England. He's
one of London's finest doctors.

643
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:21,174
Oh, I see. Well, that's different.

644
00:53:21,382 --> 00:53:23,782
- And are they still married?
- Yes.

645
00:53:23,985 --> 00:53:25,577
- How nice.
- Yes.

646
00:53:26,087 --> 00:53:27,679
And he's still Chinese.

647
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:42,961
Boy.

648
00:54:00,588 --> 00:54:02,385
Oh, Suzie, is that you?

649
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,455
- You like?
- Very pretty.

650
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,286
It's me.

651
00:54:07,095 --> 00:54:08,323
Look.

652
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:12,557
Oh, Gwenny.
It's you, Gwenny. Look.

653
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:15,730
You see this?

654
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:20,170
It's letter of introduction.

655
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:22,138
They say,

656
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,641
"To whom it may concern."

657
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:27,440
Get him in any place he want.

658
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:31,416
This his hairbrush.

659
00:54:31,986 --> 00:54:35,979
Solid silver. Cost $3,000 at least.

660
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,249
Three thousand dollars!

661
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:41,622
Someday I open shop.
Sell silver to tourists.

662
00:54:43,565 --> 00:54:45,863
Real nylon.

663
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:48,001
Cost plenty dollar.

664
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,830
When I save enough,
I open shop for men.

665
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:53,064
Maybe catch husband.

666
00:54:53,274 --> 00:54:56,607
Shirt genuine machine-made.

667
00:54:56,811 --> 00:54:58,642
London, England.

668
00:54:58,846 --> 00:55:00,575
Australian wool.

669
00:55:00,782 --> 00:55:02,443
Very expensive.

670
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:05,414
You better take shirt off.
Maybe he not like.

671
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,485
He catch you, he beat you.

672
00:55:08,523 --> 00:55:10,855
He's crazy mad about me.

673
00:55:10,992 --> 00:55:11,059
[Skipped item nr. 673]

674
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:12,390
He say to me,

675
00:55:12,594 --> 00:55:15,620
"Suzie, I'm crazy mad about you.

676
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:18,196
"You do anything you want,
for goodness' sake."

677
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:21,266
- Anything?
- I show you.

678
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,633
Hello.

679
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,241
This is Suzie Wong in
Mr. Robert Lomax's room.

680
00:55:29,444 --> 00:55:31,639
You send up tea for six, please.

681
00:55:31,846 --> 00:55:33,438
Right away.

682
00:55:33,648 --> 00:55:35,479
Charge it.

683
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:39,476
And rice cakes too.

684
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,157
You know,

685
00:55:47,362 --> 00:55:49,956
I admire your father
for being so frank in there.

686
00:55:50,164 --> 00:55:52,655
You shouldn't. He's an old fraud.

687
00:55:52,867 --> 00:55:54,858
He doesn't have a sister.

688
00:55:55,069 --> 00:55:57,469
He just likes to puncture pomposity.

689
00:55:57,672 --> 00:55:59,765
Well, then, I admire him even more.

690
00:55:59,974 --> 00:56:01,532
Good, because he admires you

691
00:56:01,743 --> 00:56:04,769
for chucking everything
for a year's go at painting.

692
00:56:05,913 --> 00:56:08,074
Why only a year?

693
00:56:09,417 --> 00:56:12,045
Simple. I'll run out of money.

694
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:15,381
Are you serious?
I mean, about your work?

695
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:18,616
Oh, I've wanted to paint ever since
I could remember.

696
00:56:18,826 --> 00:56:21,294
But like so many people,
I fell into a pattern.

697
00:56:21,496 --> 00:56:25,557
Tried to convince myself
that I liked what I was doing.

698
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:27,257
Then a few months ago,

699
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:30,904
I realized I was reaching
a point of no return.

700
00:56:31,105 --> 00:56:33,733
So I made a clean break.

701
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:38,935
Now, this next year, I have a chance
to learn something about painting

702
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:41,707
and maybe something
about myself.

703
00:56:43,951 --> 00:56:46,681
- Well, you asked for it.
- I'm nosy, aren't I?

704
00:56:46,888 --> 00:56:48,378
But I envy you.

705
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:52,025
I'd give more than a year of my life
if I knew what to give it for.

706
00:56:52,226 --> 00:56:53,853
But I don't know.

707
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:58,158
So I just go on waiting,
and I don't know what I'm waiting for.

708
00:57:00,468 --> 00:57:03,232
When will you show me
some of your painting?

709
00:57:04,439 --> 00:57:06,566
- Anytime.
- Tonight?

710
00:57:06,774 --> 00:57:08,901
Well, I can bring some by tomorrow.

711
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,338
Tonight.

712
00:57:10,545 --> 00:57:12,809
I'll drive you to your hotel.

713
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:19,820
To the left.

714
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:30,460
There's no TV, no tub,
no privacy, no...

715
00:57:30,665 --> 00:57:32,223
Well, no anything.

716
00:57:32,433 --> 00:57:34,367
But it's home.

717
00:57:37,672 --> 00:57:40,106
There are some accommodations.

718
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:42,532
Oh, you're back?

719
00:57:42,744 --> 00:57:45,611
- Take long time.
- Suzie, what are you doing here?

720
00:57:45,813 --> 00:57:48,976
- You told me to wait.
- I told you not to wait!

721
00:57:49,183 --> 00:57:50,480
Suzie's my model, you see.

722
00:57:50,685 --> 00:57:53,984
Does she just wait around
until the mood strikes you?

723
00:57:54,188 --> 00:57:57,157
I'll get your pajamas.
You want tops or bottoms tonight?

724
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:01,192
- I can get my own pajamas. Kay...
- It is late. Perhaps some other time.

725
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,192
You stay. I not mind.

726
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:06,025
I'm sure you wouldn't.
Call tomorrow if you've time.

727
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:07,758
Kay. Kay, let me see you down.

728
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:09,630
Please don't trouble.

729
00:58:09,837 --> 00:58:12,704
And it's been a lovely evening.
All of it.

730
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:22,013
Oh, fine.

731
00:58:22,517 --> 00:58:24,712
You really fixed that.

732
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,914
- Something wrong?
- What are you doing here

733
00:58:28,122 --> 00:58:31,990
- When I told you not to wait?
- I had to wait. I owe you some money.

734
00:58:32,193 --> 00:58:35,651
I got very hungry.
Ordered some tea and rice cakes.

735
00:58:35,863 --> 00:58:37,558
I charged it to you.

736
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:39,460
Now I pay.

737
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:43,660
- Go home, will you?
- Not until I pay.

738
00:58:53,548 --> 00:58:56,039
You want me to get pajamas?

739
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:59,786
Suzie, for a little girl,
you're the biggest pain that...

740
00:58:59,987 --> 00:59:02,785
Look, go on home.
I'll see you at 10:00 in the morning.

741
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:05,390
- I'll come and wake you.
- No.

742
00:59:06,027 --> 00:59:08,188
- You have good time tonight?
- Yes.

743
00:59:08,396 --> 00:59:10,489
- Pretty girls at party?
- Hundreds.

744
00:59:10,698 --> 00:59:13,189
- They have flower garden?
- Acres.

745
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:16,302
You go in dark garden
with that stuck-up Kay?

746
00:59:16,504 --> 00:59:18,995
As a matter of fact, I did.
And she isn't stuck-up.

747
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:21,937
She still virgin?

748
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:27,375
Now, listen, you're becoming too
possessive. And I don't like that.

749
00:59:27,582 --> 00:59:30,016
Now, will you go home?
I'll see you tomorrow.

750
00:59:39,427 --> 00:59:41,122
Wait.

751
00:59:53,307 --> 00:59:54,831
Go home!

752
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:13,820
Hello, Suzie.

753
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,662
- Do you want to go by?
- You let me pass, please.

754
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:30,310
- Who'd you ditch me for?
- Please, I not want any trouble.

755
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:33,139
You come to my room,
then there won't be any trouble.

756
01:00:33,347 --> 01:00:34,644
You let go of me!

757
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:36,906
You...

758
01:00:37,118 --> 01:00:38,551
You filthy little slut!

759
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:41,787
Who do you think you are?

760
01:00:54,936 --> 01:00:56,563
Who is it?

761
01:00:56,771 --> 01:00:58,295
Robert.

762
01:00:58,506 --> 01:01:00,667
Sailor hit me.

763
01:01:02,843 --> 01:01:05,073
Sailor did what?

764
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:08,242
Sailor hit me.

765
01:01:10,184 --> 01:01:11,981
Suzie, why?

766
01:01:12,787 --> 01:01:14,687
I not want to go to room
with him.

767
01:01:15,957 --> 01:01:18,118
- Where is he?
- Please. I not want trouble.

768
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:21,557
- You stay here.
- Robert!

769
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:28,698
Robert!

770
01:01:28,903 --> 01:01:30,598
Come on.
Give me the change.

771
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:34,104
- I wasted enough time in this dump.
- Sorry. Girl no work for me.

772
01:01:34,308 --> 01:01:35,707
Just a minute!

773
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:37,878
You the guy that hit
that girl upstairs?

774
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,546
You want trouble too, mister?

775
01:01:39,747 --> 01:01:42,011
- Please, not fight.
- Please, no fight here.

776
01:01:42,216 --> 01:01:44,081
Go out in street.

777
01:01:49,023 --> 01:01:50,581
I...

778
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:07,841
You said in the street?

779
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:10,010
He's in the street.

780
01:02:13,714 --> 01:02:16,376
I think this his blood.
I bite him hard.

781
01:02:16,584 --> 01:02:20,486
I kick him in shin.
I think maybe I break his leg.

782
01:02:22,189 --> 01:02:23,918
Hurt bad?

783
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,854
No, it'll be all right.

784
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,119
Now let's check.

785
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:32,557
Little cut on the inside,
but I think you'll live.

786
01:02:32,767 --> 01:02:33,995
Not die before.

787
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:37,466
- Sailor break my rib once.
- You mean this has happened before?

788
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,435
Sometimes sailors drink too much,
get very mean.

789
01:02:40,641 --> 01:02:42,074
Like to beat up bar girls.

790
01:02:42,276 --> 01:02:45,336
But, Suzie, you can't just accept
this kind of treatment.

791
01:02:45,713 --> 01:02:47,408
What I do then?

792
01:02:47,615 --> 01:02:50,243
Well, I don't know.
But I'd like to help you.

793
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:55,344
- Robert, you do me a favor?
- Of course.

794
01:02:55,556 --> 01:02:57,922
You let me tell my girlfriends
you beat me up?

795
01:02:58,426 --> 01:02:59,791
- What?
- Please.

796
01:02:59,994 --> 01:03:02,690
- Of course not.
- You not lose face.

797
01:03:02,897 --> 01:03:04,797
Tell them that I beat you up?
No!

798
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:08,867
- Oh, please. I be very proud of you.
- You're crazy.

799
01:03:09,303 --> 01:03:11,294
Not crazy.

800
01:03:11,505 --> 01:03:13,871
I go now.
Goodbye, Robert.

801
01:03:14,475 --> 01:03:16,875
I be ready in the morning.

802
01:03:42,184 --> 01:03:44,914
You know, I find Hong Kong
very stimulating at my age.

803
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:47,614
- I was here a long time ago.
- Suzie, what happen?

804
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,164
- Dear...
- You have accident? You fall down?

805
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:54,024
- Robert, he beat me up.
- Oh, you steal something from him?

806
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:57,564
No, he jealous.
He crazy in love with me.

807
01:03:57,774 --> 01:04:00,434
I tell him I have tea in his room
with my girlfriends.

808
01:04:00,644 --> 01:04:03,334
He not believe me.
He think I have tea with sailor.

809
01:04:03,544 --> 01:04:07,414
- Oh, we'll tell him the truth, Suzie.
- He not believe you, Minni Ho.

810
01:04:07,614 --> 01:04:10,204
Poor Robert,
he can't help how he feels.

811
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:13,444
Besides, he only hit me eight,
ten times.

812
01:04:13,654 --> 01:04:15,624
That prove Robert
very in love with you.

813
01:04:15,824 --> 01:04:18,584
- Oh, you very lucky, Suzie.
- I know.

814
01:04:18,794 --> 01:04:20,954
Tomorrow he'll be sorry.

815
01:04:21,164 --> 01:04:22,754
Bye, I go home now.

816
01:04:22,964 --> 01:04:25,624
So sorry you not have nice man
to beat you up.

817
01:04:25,834 --> 01:04:27,424
- Good night.
- Good night.

818
01:04:27,634 --> 01:04:29,324
Good night.

819
01:04:57,724 --> 01:04:59,694
Must be getting very hungry.

820
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:04,724
- OK, we'll go to lunch.
- Good idea.

821
01:05:06,394 --> 01:05:07,834
We go to floating restaurant.

822
01:05:08,034 --> 01:05:10,434
Head cook good friend of mine.
Cost little money.

823
01:05:10,634 --> 01:05:13,224
- How do we get there? Sampan?
- No, cost money.

824
01:05:13,434 --> 01:05:15,564
Fisherman good friend.
Take us for nothing.

825
01:05:15,774 --> 01:05:18,934
- Come on.
- OK, OK.

826
01:05:19,144 --> 01:05:20,974
Come on.

827
01:05:35,624 --> 01:05:38,114
- You know everybody?
- Used to live here once.

828
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,624
After I leave old uncle.

829
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:08,274
Robert, his son live there.
Oh, look, his baby.

830
01:07:19,464 --> 01:07:21,154
Dog up there.

831
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,994
Over there, the second one.

832
01:08:30,304 --> 01:08:32,094
Thank you very much.

833
01:08:55,694 --> 01:08:58,384
Robert, wait.
We have to pick a fish.

834
01:09:01,964 --> 01:09:04,264
- What's that?
- Parrotfish.

835
01:09:04,464 --> 01:09:06,634
- You like?
- You like?

836
01:09:06,834 --> 01:09:09,804
- I like.
- OK.

837
01:09:14,474 --> 01:09:16,004
Thank you.

838
01:09:16,584 --> 01:09:18,774
Come on, come on.

839
01:09:24,824 --> 01:09:27,814
You see, Kay, if you could talk
to old Bets, woman to woman,

840
01:09:28,024 --> 01:09:29,724
she might realize how difficult...

841
01:09:29,924 --> 01:09:32,624
There's some friends of ours aboard.
Hello there!

842
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:34,454
Oh, hello.

843
01:09:34,664 --> 01:09:37,534
Won't you join us?
Please do.

844
01:09:37,734 --> 01:09:39,254
Suzie?

845
01:09:39,734 --> 01:09:41,394
You want.

846
01:09:41,974 --> 01:09:43,534
Thank you.

847
01:09:44,604 --> 01:09:46,704
How are you, Miss Wong?
You don't know Ben.

848
01:09:46,914 --> 01:09:48,434
Mr. Marlowe.
Miss Suzie Wong.

849
01:09:48,644 --> 01:09:51,174
- How do you do?
- OK.

850
01:09:58,554 --> 01:10:01,254
Well, have you picked out your fish?

851
01:10:01,454 --> 01:10:03,824
Yes. Fish already in frying pan.

852
01:10:05,164 --> 01:10:07,754
I had Suzie posing for me
all morning.

853
01:10:07,964 --> 01:10:10,524
- I thought she deserved a good lunch.
- At least.

854
01:10:11,364 --> 01:10:13,464
I was wondering
what you'd been doing.

855
01:10:13,674 --> 01:10:16,464
- I've been working every day.
- And night.

856
01:10:18,774 --> 01:10:22,174
Am I ever going to see the results
in the daytime?

857
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,404
- Just name it.
- After lunch.

858
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:27,714
Well, I have to take Suzie home first.

859
01:10:27,914 --> 01:10:30,014
Was your name Ben?

860
01:10:30,224 --> 01:10:33,454
- Yes.
- You like to take me home, Ben?

861
01:10:33,654 --> 01:10:37,594
- Oh. Yes, I'd be delighted.
- All settled.

862
01:10:38,164 --> 01:10:39,684
You show her picture.

863
01:10:42,334 --> 01:10:43,824
Fine.

864
01:10:46,134 --> 01:10:47,764
Well...

865
01:10:47,974 --> 01:10:50,664
...this is jolly, isn't it?

866
01:11:02,184 --> 01:11:04,984
- Just a minute, Kay, I'll get the key.
- Hello, Robert.

867
01:11:05,184 --> 01:11:07,784
- Hello, Minni Ho.
- Oh, Robert,

868
01:11:07,994 --> 01:11:10,854
moneychanger say this money...

869
01:11:11,794 --> 01:11:15,234
Oh, Minni Ho,
this is Miss Kay O'Neill.

870
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:19,264
She's going upstairs
to look at some of my paintings.

871
01:11:19,604 --> 01:11:23,834
Oh, moneychanger say
this bill no good.

872
01:11:24,374 --> 01:11:27,074
Northern Ireland 5-pound note.

873
01:11:27,274 --> 01:11:31,004
- If you want, I'll change it at the bank.
- Oh, thank you, Robert.

874
01:11:31,214 --> 01:11:33,614
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
- And yours.

875
01:11:33,814 --> 01:11:37,154
This place seems to be full
of attractive models.

876
01:11:39,494 --> 01:11:42,784
Oh, I thought they'd be good,
but they're wonderful!

877
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:44,894
Thanks.
I'm glad you like them.

878
01:11:45,094 --> 01:11:48,254
Robert, we must send some to
London. I know an art dealer there.

879
01:11:48,464 --> 01:11:50,694
- We'll see what he thinks.
- That's kind,

880
01:11:50,904 --> 01:11:53,264
- But I don't want you to bother.
- It's no bother.

881
01:11:53,474 --> 01:11:56,774
Oh, don't think I'm trying to help you
just because I like you.

882
01:11:56,974 --> 01:12:01,414
I admit I'm a bit prejudiced, but I do
know something about paintings too.

883
01:12:01,614 --> 01:12:03,674
I'd be very grateful.

884
01:12:03,884 --> 01:12:06,874
I must say, Miss Wong makes
a delightful subject.

885
01:12:07,314 --> 01:12:08,974
That's my favorite.

886
01:12:09,184 --> 01:12:11,454
- Good. It's yours.
- No, you must let me pay.

887
01:12:11,654 --> 01:12:13,184
I was gonna give you one
anyway.

888
01:12:13,394 --> 01:12:16,694
- But you gotta be careful, it's still wet.
- Oh, thank you.

889
01:12:17,664 --> 01:12:20,724
Well, I'll pick the ones I like,

890
01:12:20,934 --> 01:12:23,094
then we'll see what happens.

891
01:12:30,204 --> 01:12:32,974
- Gwenny Lee.
- Hello, Robert. Where Suzie?

892
01:12:33,174 --> 01:12:35,804
I was going to ask you.
She didn't show up yesterday.

893
01:12:36,014 --> 01:12:38,534
- Do you suppose she's sick?
- Maybe.

894
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:39,974
You hit her again?

895
01:12:41,384 --> 01:12:44,444
I didn't hit her in the first place.
You know where she lives?

896
01:12:44,784 --> 01:12:49,724
Nobody know. Suzie always keep
where she live a secret.

897
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,694
- Oh, Minni Ho.
- Hello, Robert.

898
01:12:54,894 --> 01:12:57,164
Excuse me.
I got the money for you.

899
01:12:57,364 --> 01:12:58,964
Oh, how much you get, Robert?

900
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:02,134
Rate of exchange was
73 Hong Kong dollars.

901
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,744
- Oh, thank you, Robert.
- You're welcome.

902
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:11,114
Suzie!

903
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:22,454
What are you doing?

904
01:13:25,024 --> 01:13:27,724
- What's the matter with you?
- You give her money.

905
01:13:27,934 --> 01:13:30,234
I not show one night,
you got new girlfriend.

906
01:13:30,434 --> 01:13:34,394
Suzie, that was her money.
I changed it for her at the bank.

907
01:13:35,104 --> 01:13:40,004
- Oh, Minni Ho, I hurt you?
- Some friend, Suzie Wong!

908
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:42,044
You see?
You make me hurt my friend.

909
01:13:42,244 --> 01:13:44,474
I made you hurt your friend?

910
01:13:44,684 --> 01:13:46,914
Where were you yesterday?
I waited all day.

911
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:51,344
Fortune teller told me yesterday
unlucky day, so I stay home.

912
01:13:53,424 --> 01:13:57,254
I'll be the first artist to murder
his model. Come on.

913
01:14:00,164 --> 01:14:03,754
Now, admit it.
You were just sulking yesterday.

914
01:14:03,964 --> 01:14:06,864
- I not know what you mean.
- You know what I mean. Hello?

915
01:14:07,074 --> 01:14:10,634
- Wait a minute. What are you doing?
- Looking for hairpins.

916
01:14:10,844 --> 01:14:12,534
Hello?

917
01:14:13,014 --> 01:14:14,634
Right here.

918
01:14:17,784 --> 01:14:19,344
Yes?

919
01:14:20,084 --> 01:14:21,674
Oh, yes?

920
01:14:21,954 --> 01:14:24,144
Send him up, please.

921
01:14:25,024 --> 01:14:27,884
- Send who up?
- Ben.

922
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:33,484
He take me for drive after lunch
other day.

923
01:14:33,694 --> 01:14:35,754
He's very nice, that Ben.

924
01:14:35,964 --> 01:14:40,734
What you and that stuck-up Kay do?
Come here and talk?

925
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:42,464
She's trying to help me.

926
01:14:42,674 --> 01:14:45,194
Sent some of my paintings
to a London art dealer.

927
01:14:45,404 --> 01:14:47,844
Why she not buy some herself?

928
01:14:48,044 --> 01:14:50,604
I'm not depending on charity.

929
01:14:51,914 --> 01:14:53,544
Robert...

930
01:14:54,014 --> 01:14:56,454
...why not let me be
your permanent girlfriend?

931
01:14:56,654 --> 01:14:59,414
Oh, stop it, Suzie.
We've been all through that.

932
01:15:05,564 --> 01:15:07,424
I don't mean to hurt your feelings.

933
01:15:07,634 --> 01:15:11,124
But I've had my share of women
and all the trouble that goes with it.

934
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:14,274
I came here to paint.
I don't want to get involved.

935
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:18,874
You're not even 20.
I'm pushing 40.

936
01:15:20,144 --> 01:15:22,164
That not good reason, Robert.

937
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:27,574
All right,
I can't accept your way of life.

938
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:30,484
I can't have you give me love
on the days you're free!

939
01:15:30,684 --> 01:15:33,714
What I do then?
Must have money, Robert.

940
01:15:33,924 --> 01:15:36,184
Hong Kong full of people
looking for work.

941
01:15:36,394 --> 01:15:39,384
If I get hungry and beg on street,
this will make you happy?

942
01:15:39,594 --> 01:15:42,794
How do you think I'd feel every time
you'd leave this room?

943
01:15:45,104 --> 01:15:46,624
Come in.

944
01:15:50,574 --> 01:15:53,304
- Hello, Lomax.
- Hello.

945
01:15:53,974 --> 01:15:57,274
- Am I interrupting something?
- Oh, no. We were just discussing

946
01:15:57,484 --> 01:16:00,074
the ethnic concepts of morality.

947
01:16:00,284 --> 01:16:02,084
Well, that's very interesting.

948
01:16:02,284 --> 01:16:06,154
- What you want?
- Well, I was wondering if I could...

949
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:08,124
...well, talk to you.

950
01:16:08,324 --> 01:16:10,594
OK. You want to talk,
we talk.

951
01:16:10,794 --> 01:16:13,824
- I hope I'm not trespassing, old man.
- Don't mind me. Come in.

952
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:16,964
You see? Robert not mind
what we talk.

953
01:16:17,334 --> 01:16:21,324
Yes, but this is rather personal.

954
01:16:21,734 --> 01:16:26,004
- Suzie is just my model. That's all.
- I very good model.

955
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:28,774
But wages not too good.

956
01:16:29,814 --> 01:16:31,544
Well...

957
01:16:31,744 --> 01:16:35,114
...I might as well tell you
that I've split with my wife.

958
01:16:35,314 --> 01:16:38,374
I'm not the kind of man
who can endure being alone.

959
01:16:38,584 --> 01:16:41,284
I need female companionship.

960
01:16:41,624 --> 01:16:45,824
I have a friend with a rather happy
arrangement with one of you girls.

961
01:16:46,164 --> 01:16:48,294
It's worked out very well
for both of them.

962
01:16:48,494 --> 01:16:52,404
I was wondering if we couldn't get
together on the same sort of basis too.

963
01:16:54,404 --> 01:16:57,134
You think it's a good idea, Robert?

964
01:16:57,444 --> 01:17:01,704
- What?
- To be Ben's permanent girlfriend?

965
01:17:03,444 --> 01:17:04,814
You do what you want.

966
01:17:05,184 --> 01:17:09,014
What I want is good man
with big heart,

967
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:14,054
who say, "Suzie, you're nice girl,
and I love nice girl."

968
01:17:14,754 --> 01:17:18,624
But I guess maybe I never find
such man. Will l, Robert?

969
01:17:19,694 --> 01:17:21,064
I've already told you.

970
01:17:21,534 --> 01:17:25,124
I'll try and be good to you, Suzie.
You won't find me ungenerous.

971
01:17:25,464 --> 01:17:28,404
You still let me pose for Robert
if I say yes?

972
01:17:28,604 --> 01:17:33,874
Oh, of course, yes.
Yes, we're both gentlemen. I trust him.

973
01:17:34,114 --> 01:17:37,774
I not want you to trust him.
I want you to trust me.

974
01:17:37,984 --> 01:17:42,144
I not dirty street-girl. If I your regular
girlfriend, I never go with another man.

975
01:17:42,354 --> 01:17:44,514
No. Of course not, no.

976
01:17:46,224 --> 01:17:48,244
You think Ben'll be good for me,
Robert?

977
01:17:49,864 --> 01:17:52,194
Look, you've got the whole city
of Hong Kong to make deals in.

978
01:17:52,394 --> 01:17:54,054
Why use my room
for your pickups?

979
01:17:54,264 --> 01:17:57,294
I'm sorry, old man, you said
it didn't make any difference.

980
01:17:57,734 --> 01:17:59,564
It doesn't.

981
01:18:00,074 --> 01:18:02,334
Well, if you don't want me now,
I go with Ben.

982
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:04,474
I don't want you.

983
01:18:05,304 --> 01:18:07,834
I feel very sorry for you, Robert.

984
01:18:08,044 --> 01:18:10,774
You not big man.
You little man.

985
01:18:10,984 --> 01:18:14,044
And little man have little heart.

986
01:18:16,254 --> 01:18:17,814
Well...

987
01:18:18,024 --> 01:18:19,684
...that's that.

988
01:18:31,434 --> 01:18:34,334
Good morning, Robert.
You up very early.

989
01:18:34,534 --> 01:18:37,764
- Either that, or you're up very late.
- Excuse me if I not stop.

990
01:18:37,974 --> 01:18:40,344
I look like ugly dragon this morning.

991
01:18:41,644 --> 01:18:45,474
Well, for goodness' sake!
Not expect to find you here.

992
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:49,044
Just come by to see if Gwenny Lee
would like to go shopping.

993
01:18:49,254 --> 01:18:51,184
She's upstairs.

994
01:18:51,554 --> 01:18:54,994
Ben go to Macao on business today.
Nothing for me to do.

995
01:18:55,194 --> 01:18:59,154
- If you like, I pose for you.
- Thanks, I have plans.

996
01:19:00,494 --> 01:19:03,724
Guess what?
Ben say he'll take me to England.

997
01:19:03,934 --> 01:19:06,664
- He did, huh?
- He's crazy about me.

998
01:19:06,874 --> 01:19:10,304
He'll do anything I ask.
Wants to marry me.

999
01:19:10,504 --> 01:19:12,404
Then why doesn't he?

1000
01:19:12,744 --> 01:19:15,574
It's that stuck-up wife.
She make trouble for him.

1001
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:19,144
- I just hate her.
- You don't even know her.

1002
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:21,514
But he's gonna get divorce.

1003
01:19:22,684 --> 01:19:26,624
- I wouldn't count on that.
- Well, he is.

1004
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:31,614
He's so good to me. I never had
anyone so good to me before.

1005
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:35,084
He take me into big store,
and he say to clerk,

1006
01:19:35,734 --> 01:19:41,134
"This little lady Miss Suzie Wong.
You let her charge anything she want."

1007
01:19:41,334 --> 01:19:44,364
Now, what you think of that,
for goodness' sake?

1008
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,944
You seem to have all you need.
You should be very happy.

1009
01:19:51,484 --> 01:19:52,714
Why you hate me?

1010
01:19:55,214 --> 01:19:56,554
Why should I hate you?

1011
01:19:56,954 --> 01:19:58,214
I not know.

1012
01:19:58,424 --> 01:20:01,784
But I see it in your eyes.
You hate me.

1013
01:20:03,324 --> 01:20:05,624
Look, if you sit here
and chat with me all day,

1014
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,064
you'll have little time
to spend Ben's money.

1015
01:20:08,264 --> 01:20:10,134
Excuse me.

1016
01:20:19,644 --> 01:20:22,944
Robert, it's getting awfully late.
I really must go.

1017
01:20:24,314 --> 01:20:27,874
I'm sorry, Kay,
I became so involved I forgot.

1018
01:20:28,484 --> 01:20:32,814
- I'll never straighten my neck again.
- Here, maybe this'll take the kinks out.

1019
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,084
You've been very patient.

1020
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:37,054
That's divine.

1021
01:20:37,264 --> 01:20:41,094
It'll be a lovely night. Like to come to
dinner? We could eat on the terrace.

1022
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:43,454
Australian oysters
flown in this morning.

1023
01:20:43,664 --> 01:20:46,534
- That does it. What time?
- Seven-ish.

1024
01:20:46,734 --> 01:20:48,704
You've got a deal.

1025
01:20:51,504 --> 01:20:55,534
- I not know you having party.
- Well, I didn't recognize you.

1026
01:20:55,744 --> 01:20:57,974
We've been working all day.
I was just going.

1027
01:20:58,184 --> 01:20:59,544
Oh, I not keep you, then.

1028
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:02,744
It's funny, you always seem
to be arriving when I'm leaving.

1029
01:21:02,954 --> 01:21:06,154
We must reverse that someday.
Bye, Robert. See you later.

1030
01:21:06,354 --> 01:21:09,224
Oh, yes, Kay, 7.

1031
01:21:34,754 --> 01:21:36,584
Take that terrible dress off.

1032
01:21:37,724 --> 01:21:39,384
This expensive dress.

1033
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:43,544
I don't care what it cost. You look like
a cheap European streetwalker.

1034
01:21:43,764 --> 01:21:45,194
You shut up!

1035
01:21:45,894 --> 01:21:48,094
Now, just a minute.

1036
01:21:49,194 --> 01:21:52,764
- Why not a ring in your nose?
- Leave me alone. Dress cost plenty.

1037
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:55,234
- What you doing?
- I'll show you.

1038
01:21:55,434 --> 01:21:58,604
- You jealous. I have him beat you up.
- Yeah.

1039
01:21:58,804 --> 01:22:01,174
This fine, expensive dress
cost plenty dollar.

1040
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:04,714
- Same as your English girl wear.
- Look at these horrible shoes.

1041
01:22:04,914 --> 01:22:08,074
- They cost 84 Hong Kong dollars.
- I don't care what they cost.

1042
01:22:08,284 --> 01:22:10,374
They're terrible!

1043
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:17,084
You haven't the faintest idea
what real beauty is.

1044
01:22:17,294 --> 01:22:21,124
You haven't sense enough to realize
you don't need a lot of tinsel on you.

1045
01:22:35,814 --> 01:22:38,004
Why don't you leave me alone?

1046
01:22:38,444 --> 01:22:40,544
Get out of my life, will you?

1047
01:22:51,624 --> 01:22:53,424
Oh, Lomax.

1048
01:22:55,734 --> 01:22:57,254
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming.

1049
01:22:57,464 --> 01:23:00,694
- Won't you sit down? Have a drink?
- No. You said it was urgent.

1050
01:23:00,904 --> 01:23:04,844
Well, yes.
Well, won't you please sit down.

1051
01:23:07,814 --> 01:23:10,544
- You sure you wouldn't like to have...?
- What is it?

1052
01:23:10,814 --> 01:23:12,444
Well...

1053
01:23:12,644 --> 01:23:15,554
...it's about Suzie.
- Isn't that your problem?

1054
01:23:15,754 --> 01:23:19,124
Yes. Yes, I know, but...
And I don't know how to handle it.

1055
01:23:19,324 --> 01:23:20,754
You see...

1056
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,354
...my wife found out about her.

1057
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:26,824
I wouldn't have old Bets discover this
for anything in the world.

1058
01:23:27,034 --> 01:23:28,964
How did she find out?

1059
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:31,524
I told her.

1060
01:23:31,734 --> 01:23:33,464
Sorta stupid of me, wasn't it?

1061
01:23:33,934 --> 01:23:37,394
I got loaded, and she...

1062
01:23:37,874 --> 01:23:41,704
...let me make love to her
for the first time in almost a year.

1063
01:23:41,914 --> 01:23:46,144
And she was so sweet, I upped and
confessed out of sheer gratitude.

1064
01:23:46,884 --> 01:23:49,514
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.

1065
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:52,654
She just got up,
made out a little list,

1066
01:23:52,854 --> 01:23:56,084
gave it to me, packed
and left the house.

1067
01:23:56,294 --> 01:24:00,284
A list of things I'd have to do
to avoid a scandal and divorce.

1068
01:24:01,364 --> 01:24:02,954
Suzie says you want a divorce.

1069
01:24:04,564 --> 01:24:08,234
You can't be serious. Oh,
Suzie's quite exceptional and all that.

1070
01:24:08,574 --> 01:24:12,134
But one just doesn't do
that sort of thing with that sort of girl.

1071
01:24:12,744 --> 01:24:15,374
I don't want to hurt Suzie.

1072
01:24:15,574 --> 01:24:17,804
She's been very decent.

1073
01:24:18,444 --> 01:24:22,404
If it hadn't been for Suzie, old Betsy
and I wouldn't have got together again.

1074
01:24:23,254 --> 01:24:26,084
- So?
- Well...

1075
01:24:27,194 --> 01:24:29,984
...you see, I was wondering
if you'd be a sport

1076
01:24:30,194 --> 01:24:31,924
and explain to Suzie for me.

1077
01:24:32,124 --> 01:24:35,624
She likes you. She'd listen. Of course,
I want to give her something.

1078
01:24:35,834 --> 01:24:39,494
You mean, you want to throw her out,
but you want me to tell her.

1079
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,874
Yes, I'd be very grateful
if you would.

1080
01:24:42,074 --> 01:24:44,544
Oh, I'm sure you would be.

1081
01:24:44,844 --> 01:24:48,274
- We chaps have to stick together.
- I'd hoped you'd see it that way.

1082
01:24:49,814 --> 01:24:51,874
Yes, we're two of a kind.

1083
01:24:52,084 --> 01:24:54,054
We know she isn't
really a human being,

1084
01:24:54,254 --> 01:24:57,344
so she couldn't possibly have
any feelings.

1085
01:24:57,684 --> 01:25:00,744
Since she's Chinese,
it wouldn't matter anyhow.

1086
01:25:22,844 --> 01:25:25,474
Why you so nice to me
all of a sudden?

1087
01:25:25,684 --> 01:25:27,874
You going away someplace?

1088
01:25:29,684 --> 01:25:31,214
Have you seen Ben?

1089
01:25:31,424 --> 01:25:34,084
Oh, yes.
He bring me here in taxi.

1090
01:25:34,654 --> 01:25:38,214
Oh, I tell you, that Ben,
he just can't do too much for me.

1091
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:43,164
He say, "Suzie, darling,
please say you'll marry me."

1092
01:25:43,364 --> 01:25:44,594
Oh, that Ben.

1093
01:25:44,804 --> 01:25:48,434
- He's crazy mad about me.
- Suzie, he's through with you.

1094
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:53,434
What you mean?

1095
01:25:54,044 --> 01:25:55,444
He's going back to his wife.

1096
01:25:57,784 --> 01:25:59,644
I not believe you.

1097
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:02,014
He asked me to tell you.

1098
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:12,894
So finish.

1099
01:26:16,234 --> 01:26:17,564
OK.

1100
01:26:17,764 --> 01:26:20,234
I not see Ben for two days.

1101
01:26:20,434 --> 01:26:22,494
You catch me making lies again.

1102
01:26:22,704 --> 01:26:25,194
It's better to pretend.

1103
01:26:25,604 --> 01:26:29,234
- I'm sorry I lost my temper yesterday.
- Oh, I forget.

1104
01:26:29,444 --> 01:26:32,714
It's all over now.
Not important.

1105
01:26:34,154 --> 01:26:36,054
I guess I go to cinema now.

1106
01:26:36,254 --> 01:26:39,454
Oh, I hear film at Bijou very good.
Musical film.

1107
01:26:39,854 --> 01:26:41,514
You hear about it, maybe?

1108
01:26:41,724 --> 01:26:43,024
I don't think I have.

1109
01:26:43,394 --> 01:26:46,224
Oh, everybody talking about
that film, for goodness' sake.

1110
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,394
I not want to miss it.
If I hurry, I get good seat.

1111
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:51,624
May I go with you?

1112
01:26:52,164 --> 01:26:55,034
No. I don't think film
would interest you.

1113
01:26:56,574 --> 01:26:58,234
Suzie, don't let it touch you.

1114
01:27:02,714 --> 01:27:07,204
My name Mee Ling.
My father very rich man.

1115
01:27:07,414 --> 01:27:11,114
I not dirty street-girl.
I not dirty street-girl!

1116
01:27:11,324 --> 01:27:13,254
Oh, Suzie!

1117
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:15,454
Don't go away. Stay with me.

1118
01:27:15,654 --> 01:27:18,624
Why you care? Nothing to you.

1119
01:27:18,824 --> 01:27:20,694
Nothing to me?

1120
01:27:20,894 --> 01:27:22,994
It just kills me.

1121
01:27:23,704 --> 01:27:25,424
Let me take care of you.

1122
01:27:25,634 --> 01:27:29,734
We'll work it out somehow.
But please don't go away.

1123
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:33,434
No. Tonight you sorry for me.

1124
01:27:33,644 --> 01:27:35,504
Tomorrow will be different.

1125
01:27:35,914 --> 01:27:38,314
Tomorrow will be worse.

1126
01:27:38,884 --> 01:27:41,044
How can I tell you
how much I need you?

1127
01:27:54,734 --> 01:27:56,424
Robert,

1128
01:27:56,634 --> 01:27:59,324
if you ask nice English girl
to stay with you,

1129
01:27:59,534 --> 01:28:01,434
she stay first time you ask her?

1130
01:28:03,844 --> 01:28:06,964
I don't know.
I guess not. Why?

1131
01:28:08,044 --> 01:28:11,244
I want to be like nice English girl
for you.

1132
01:28:11,714 --> 01:28:13,544
So I'm very sorry, Robert.

1133
01:28:13,754 --> 01:28:17,274
I like you very much.
But I don't think I can stay with you.

1134
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:19,554
- I go now.
- Suzie,

1135
01:28:19,754 --> 01:28:22,284
this is silly.
This is no time to pretend.

1136
01:28:22,494 --> 01:28:25,894
I not stay with anyone
who ask me first time.

1137
01:28:26,094 --> 01:28:28,124
Good night, Robert.

1138
01:28:29,534 --> 01:28:31,694
Thank you very much.

1139
01:29:12,844 --> 01:29:15,474
Is now tomorrow, Robert.

1140
01:29:18,344 --> 01:29:21,474
I never do anything like this before.

1141
01:29:26,454 --> 01:29:28,984
You my first man.

1142
01:29:29,254 --> 01:29:31,094
You believe?

1143
01:29:31,864 --> 01:29:33,694
I believe.

1144
01:29:40,334 --> 01:29:42,864
And you're my first girl.

1145
01:30:26,214 --> 01:30:28,374
Tell him no clippers.

1146
01:30:32,284 --> 01:30:34,844
Not too much off over the ears.

1147
01:30:39,794 --> 01:30:43,784
- Maybe I'd better forget the...
- Oh, no. He very good barber.

1148
01:31:09,054 --> 01:31:13,054
Honorable gentleman like to ask,
where you been for the last hour?

1149
01:31:14,764 --> 01:31:16,624
- Well?
- Oh, just go out.

1150
01:31:16,834 --> 01:31:18,964
I thought I'd be back before you.

1151
01:31:19,164 --> 01:31:22,694
- No, seriously, where were you?
- Oh, for a walk. Why?

1152
01:31:22,904 --> 01:31:25,034
- You afraid I get run over?
- Always.

1153
01:31:25,244 --> 01:31:27,734
Now, listen, you gotta stop
this disappearing act.

1154
01:31:27,944 --> 01:31:30,314
It makes me nervous.
I never know where you are.

1155
01:31:30,514 --> 01:31:32,574
Well, I go to temple to pray.

1156
01:31:32,784 --> 01:31:36,084
- This bad?
- No, that's good.

1157
01:31:38,424 --> 01:31:41,654
Now, look. You sit here.
I've got something for you.

1158
01:31:41,854 --> 01:31:44,344
- What?
- Never mind.

1159
01:31:50,334 --> 01:31:53,354
Oh, Robert, so beautiful.

1160
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:55,934
- Where do you find?
- Very stuck-up shop.

1161
01:31:56,134 --> 01:31:59,194
- And that's not all.
- You take back. Cost plenty dollar.

1162
01:31:59,404 --> 01:32:02,004
Plenty, but you're gonna
make me famous.

1163
01:32:02,214 --> 01:32:06,304
Now, the man swore
on his grandmother's honor

1164
01:32:06,514 --> 01:32:09,484
that these had been
worn by an empress.

1165
01:32:13,024 --> 01:32:16,154
You're crazy, Robert.
Oh, I take back right away.

1166
01:32:16,354 --> 01:32:19,154
No, put on right away.

1167
01:32:24,264 --> 01:32:26,594
Now what's the matter?

1168
01:32:29,734 --> 01:32:34,034
You smoke cigarette.
I put on dress.

1169
01:32:37,314 --> 01:32:39,404
Oh, you.

1170
01:33:06,504 --> 01:33:10,964
- Hey, hurry up. It's raining.
- You can come in now.

1171
01:33:25,594 --> 01:33:28,124
Would an empress do that?

1172
01:33:28,334 --> 01:33:29,924
No.

1173
01:33:31,534 --> 01:33:34,434
Only Wan Chai girl in love.

1174
01:33:42,514 --> 01:33:45,244
A little hazardous for kissing.

1175
01:33:45,444 --> 01:33:50,574
Well, you tilt head to one side,
and I tilt head to other.

1176
01:33:53,824 --> 01:33:58,284
- Clever, these Chinese.
- Now I tilt to other side.

1177
01:34:13,174 --> 01:34:16,004
- Hi.
- Sorry, I wake you.

1178
01:34:16,214 --> 01:34:17,944
Go back to sleep.
I'll be back soon.

1179
01:34:18,144 --> 01:34:20,814
- Where you going?
- To visit Minni Ho.

1180
01:34:21,514 --> 01:34:25,974
Oh, come on, now. Minni Ho went
to Macao yesterday. Don't lie to me.

1181
01:34:26,184 --> 01:34:28,214
Why I lie? Just go for walk, Robert.

1182
01:34:28,424 --> 01:34:31,484
But where you going? Half the
time I don't know where you are.

1183
01:34:31,694 --> 01:34:34,564
Well, I'll be back soon.

1184
01:34:34,764 --> 01:34:38,024
- In that case, I'm going with you.
- No.

1185
01:34:38,234 --> 01:34:40,294
Suzie.

1186
01:36:58,644 --> 01:37:01,474
Suzie, I know you're in there.

1187
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:11,484
Is my baby.

1188
01:37:19,594 --> 01:37:22,124
Yours?

1189
01:37:22,334 --> 01:37:25,524
My baby need me.
I see him every day.

1190
01:37:27,204 --> 01:37:29,564
Why didn't you tell me?

1191
01:37:29,774 --> 01:37:34,174
I was afraid. Afraid you not
want girl with baby.

1192
01:37:34,374 --> 01:37:37,314
Afraid police take my baby away.

1193
01:37:37,514 --> 01:37:39,144
Police?

1194
01:37:39,744 --> 01:37:44,084
Father very important man.
Work for government.

1195
01:37:44,284 --> 01:37:49,154
But he not want baby.
He say to police I blackmail him.

1196
01:37:49,354 --> 01:37:52,794
I not understand,
but nobody take my baby away.

1197
01:37:53,394 --> 01:37:55,334
I hide him with Amah.

1198
01:37:56,134 --> 01:37:59,434
You not make me
give baby up, Robert?

1199
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:08,314
I not want to leave you, Robert.

1200
01:38:20,724 --> 01:38:23,624
You beat me up, please?

1201
01:38:56,654 --> 01:39:01,184
- You wanna take our picture?
- Oh, no, I was just admiring the baby.

1202
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:03,724
- What's his name?
- Winston.

1203
01:39:03,934 --> 01:39:07,064
- Winston?
- He's named after Winston Churchill.

1204
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:08,934
Yours?

1205
01:39:09,134 --> 01:39:12,404
- All mine.
- Wow.

1206
01:39:17,114 --> 01:39:19,374
Sorry I so long.

1207
01:39:19,584 --> 01:39:22,074
It's about time.

1208
01:39:35,194 --> 01:39:37,924
Robert, wait. What is today?

1209
01:39:38,134 --> 01:39:42,124
- Tuesday the first, isn't it?
- Second day of third moon.

1210
01:39:42,334 --> 01:39:44,894
I must have my fortune told.

1211
01:39:48,344 --> 01:39:53,044
- You mean he tells fortunes?
- He very wise old Tibetan monk.

1212
01:39:55,084 --> 01:39:57,914
What will he do? Tell your fortune
or give you a shampoo?

1213
01:39:58,124 --> 01:40:00,244
He wants to feel
if I have any new bumps.

1214
01:40:00,624 --> 01:40:03,924
Well, if he finds any, will you
tell him I didn't put them there?

1215
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:06,724
Oh, he say I very lucky girl.

1216
01:40:06,924 --> 01:40:10,454
- He say I go to America.
- Oh, a travel agent, huh?

1217
01:40:10,664 --> 01:40:14,894
He say I be very happy there
and live long life.

1218
01:40:15,104 --> 01:40:17,624
He say I make trip to America
straight after rains.

1219
01:40:17,844 --> 01:40:19,604
He forecasts the weather too?

1220
01:40:20,144 --> 01:40:23,514
He mean big rain that come
every year to Hong Kong. Very bad.

1221
01:40:26,044 --> 01:40:27,714
You give him $1 now, please.

1222
01:40:27,914 --> 01:40:31,114
- You mean he gets paid for that?
- Oh, he very wise old monk.

1223
01:40:31,324 --> 01:40:35,654
- He take money.
- Yes, very wise.

1224
01:40:36,454 --> 01:40:38,894
You're doing better than I am.

1225
01:40:44,104 --> 01:40:47,334
- These are wonderful.
- Thank you.

1226
01:40:47,534 --> 01:40:50,704
- It's an adorable baby.
- Yes, he is.

1227
01:40:50,904 --> 01:40:56,274
It's amazing. You've managed
to make her look positively maternal.

1228
01:40:57,644 --> 01:40:59,614
You're right. Hong Kong
is not the place

1229
01:40:59,814 --> 01:41:01,974
- To sell paintings of Chinese babies.
- No.

1230
01:41:02,184 --> 01:41:05,744
- I thought they were commercial.
- Much better to send them to London.

1231
01:41:05,954 --> 01:41:08,254
We haven't had a reaction
from the first batch.

1232
01:41:08,454 --> 01:41:10,854
- Oh, you will.
- I hope so.

1233
01:41:11,064 --> 01:41:13,324
Need money?

1234
01:41:14,464 --> 01:41:16,654
Robert, why don't you...?

1235
01:41:16,864 --> 01:41:18,854
Why don't you let me
pay you in advance?

1236
01:41:19,064 --> 01:41:21,224
- I'm sure they'll sell.
- You're a darling,

1237
01:41:21,434 --> 01:41:25,064
but there's one kind of artist
I'm not going to be.

1238
01:41:25,274 --> 01:41:29,434
- If you were sick you'd let me help.
- I'm not that sick.

1239
01:42:19,494 --> 01:42:23,324
- About time.
- Oh, sorry I late.

1240
01:42:23,534 --> 01:42:25,834
You show pictures to English girl?

1241
01:42:26,034 --> 01:42:29,434
- She know somebody want to buy?
- No, but...

1242
01:42:29,634 --> 01:42:35,304
- Like this.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, I know, like this.

1243
01:42:35,514 --> 01:42:39,274
She's gonna send them on to London.

1244
01:42:39,484 --> 01:42:41,844
But that'll take a long time.

1245
01:42:42,054 --> 01:42:48,254
- Well, we'll just have to wait.
- Robert, use this, please.

1246
01:42:51,694 --> 01:42:53,324
You too.

1247
01:42:53,524 --> 01:42:56,624
Is money I save for my baby,
so he won't grow up coolie boy.

1248
01:42:56,834 --> 01:42:58,924
But baby too little to use now.

1249
01:42:59,134 --> 01:43:01,564
Pretty soon you be big man.
Then you help him.

1250
01:43:01,774 --> 01:43:04,364
So now use money.

1251
01:43:17,724 --> 01:43:19,714
He said it was a personal matter.

1252
01:43:19,924 --> 01:43:21,894
A personal matter?
What could he mean?

1253
01:43:22,094 --> 01:43:24,214
You run a bank,
what else could it mean?

1254
01:43:24,424 --> 01:43:27,054
His money's gone,
he wants to borrow money?

1255
01:43:27,264 --> 01:43:29,564
He's very talented.

1256
01:43:29,764 --> 01:43:32,134
Darling, if you don't want
to support me

1257
01:43:32,334 --> 01:43:36,034
for the rest of your life,
you better help him.

1258
01:43:37,304 --> 01:43:41,144
Oh, I see. All right,
ask him to come in.

1259
01:43:42,074 --> 01:43:44,414
- You can come in now.
- Thanks.

1260
01:43:44,614 --> 01:43:46,204
- Hello, Robert.
- How are you?

1261
01:43:46,414 --> 01:43:49,714
- Good to see you. Sit down.
- I won't take much of your time.

1262
01:43:49,914 --> 01:43:52,414
What I want can be answered
with a quick yes or no.

1263
01:43:52,624 --> 01:43:54,384
No, I'm much
too garrulous for that.

1264
01:43:54,594 --> 01:43:58,614
Besides, bankers don't like
coming right down to the point.

1265
01:43:59,224 --> 01:44:00,784
I want you to help me get a job.

1266
01:44:01,194 --> 01:44:04,824
- Well, what about your painting?
- I have to earn a living.

1267
01:44:05,034 --> 01:44:08,694
But I thought you came with enough
money to see you through for a year.

1268
01:44:08,904 --> 01:44:10,264
I spent it.

1269
01:44:10,474 --> 01:44:15,414
Do you think you can work
and paint in your spare time?

1270
01:44:15,614 --> 01:44:17,344
No, sir, I don't.

1271
01:44:17,544 --> 01:44:20,984
- And you've made a choice?
- Yes, I've made a choice.

1272
01:44:21,184 --> 01:44:24,584
All right, I'll see what
I can do for you. Sit down.

1273
01:44:48,644 --> 01:44:51,544
- Where you go, for goodness' sake?
- I went to get a job.

1274
01:44:51,744 --> 01:44:53,574
What do you mean?

1275
01:44:53,784 --> 01:44:56,944
O'Neill is going to help me get a job.

1276
01:44:57,154 --> 01:45:01,114
- You mean, you not paint anymore?
- Look, if I were a prizefighter,

1277
01:45:01,324 --> 01:45:05,624
and I kept getting my brains knocked
out, I'd be foolish if I didn't quit, huh?

1278
01:45:05,824 --> 01:45:10,324
I'm not good enough to paint, and I'm
tired of getting my brains knocked out.

1279
01:45:11,134 --> 01:45:12,794
I've worked in an office before.

1280
01:45:13,004 --> 01:45:15,494
- Why you not tell me you do this?
- Why should I?

1281
01:45:15,704 --> 01:45:17,634
I didn't want your money,
and Ah Tong

1282
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:19,964
tells me you paid the rent with it.

1283
01:45:20,174 --> 01:45:22,474
Robert, please not give up painting.
Without painting you'll die inside.

1284
01:45:22,474 --> 01:45:24,744
Robert, please not give up painting.
Without painting you'll die inside.

1285
01:45:24,944 --> 01:45:29,474
Then I die. But I not important.
Only important you be important.

1286
01:45:29,684 --> 01:45:32,314
What am I going to do?
Sit here and let us starve,

1287
01:45:32,524 --> 01:45:34,814
swallowing bits of my pride
until it chokes me?

1288
01:45:35,024 --> 01:45:38,654
- Why you not let me help?
- Just how do you propose to do that?

1289
01:45:39,094 --> 01:45:41,584
Go back to work?

1290
01:45:43,034 --> 01:45:44,654
I not mind.

1291
01:45:44,864 --> 01:45:48,964
No love, no feeling, just like
holding someone for a dance.

1292
01:45:50,434 --> 01:45:52,164
What do I do?
Walk around the block

1293
01:45:52,374 --> 01:45:55,314
while you bring sailors here?
You know what that makes me?

1294
01:45:55,514 --> 01:45:57,304
- Robert!
- Get out! Be a prostitute!

1295
01:45:57,514 --> 01:46:01,344
I shouldn't have touched you.
I can get ten like you in two minutes.

1296
01:46:01,554 --> 01:46:05,484
All I have to do is use the phone.
You want to see? Ah Tong.

1297
01:46:20,874 --> 01:46:25,834
- Sorry, Robert, not today.
- OK, thanks.

1298
01:46:31,914 --> 01:46:34,434
Oh, Gwenny,
has Suzie been around?

1299
01:46:34,654 --> 01:46:37,314
Suzie never come in bar
without you, Robert.

1300
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:39,814
- Something wrong?
- No, no.

1301
01:46:40,024 --> 01:46:41,314
Maybe she go to see movie.

1302
01:46:41,524 --> 01:46:44,724
New picture just started,
very good. I see three times.

1303
01:46:44,924 --> 01:46:48,054
Yeah, maybe. I'll look for her.

1304
01:47:20,394 --> 01:47:22,424
I'm sorry.

1305
01:47:37,414 --> 01:47:40,244
A girl there, Wong.

1306
01:47:58,864 --> 01:48:01,164
- Is she a relation?
- A friend.

1307
01:48:01,374 --> 01:48:03,864
- Has she got any relations?
- Not that I know of.

1308
01:48:04,074 --> 01:48:06,164
- Where'd she work?
- Is that important?

1309
01:48:06,374 --> 01:48:11,174
- It is if we're going to ask questions.
- Nam Kok bar.

1310
01:48:11,384 --> 01:48:15,184
She's a Wan Chai girl, but at least
you people must have some records.

1311
01:48:15,384 --> 01:48:17,074
Very well, I'll see what I can do.

1312
01:48:17,284 --> 01:48:20,314
Understand that there are
3 million people in Hong Kong.

1313
01:48:20,524 --> 01:48:24,584
Over 2 million are refugees, who
live in anthills, sampans and streets.

1314
01:48:24,794 --> 01:48:27,154
Thousands more come in
from China every month.

1315
01:48:27,534 --> 01:48:31,154
Certainly, we have records,
but our hands are full 24 hours a day.

1316
01:48:31,364 --> 01:48:34,764
I know what the odds are,
but at least you can try.

1317
01:48:34,974 --> 01:48:36,564
Of course.

1318
01:48:36,774 --> 01:48:39,934
- Name?
- Suzie Wong.

1319
01:49:28,794 --> 01:49:32,524
I ask everybody where
Suzie went, Robert. Nobody see.

1320
01:49:32,724 --> 01:49:37,354
- She just disappear.
- I've got to find her, Gwenny.

1321
01:49:37,564 --> 01:49:42,734
- I know she needs me.
- Maybe she write nice letter.

1322
01:49:42,934 --> 01:49:45,404
You know she can't write.

1323
01:49:46,774 --> 01:49:49,404
I keep looking.

1324
01:49:49,614 --> 01:49:53,414
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Robert.

1325
01:49:53,614 --> 01:49:58,174
I knit socks for you.
I hope they fit.

1326
01:50:01,694 --> 01:50:03,714
You're a doll.

1327
01:50:39,124 --> 01:50:42,294
- You looking for girl, mister?
- Yes, Suzie.

1328
01:50:42,494 --> 01:50:45,894
- You like me? Take me with you.
- Go back and play with your dolls.

1329
01:50:46,104 --> 01:50:49,264
Oh, please, mister, you Ionely,
I make you forget.

1330
01:50:49,474 --> 01:50:51,464
Mister, take me
with you. I very nice.

1331
01:50:51,674 --> 01:50:54,304
- No, take me with you.
- Get away, get away.

1332
01:51:28,874 --> 01:51:31,104
- Suzie.
- Well, there you are.

1333
01:51:33,984 --> 01:51:36,314
The door was open.
I hope you don't mind.

1334
01:51:36,514 --> 01:51:39,244
- Of course not, Kay.
- Where have you been?

1335
01:51:39,454 --> 01:51:41,154
Out in the rain, mostly.

1336
01:51:41,354 --> 01:51:43,414
- Is something wrong?
- Something's right.

1337
01:51:43,624 --> 01:51:48,494
They sold one of your paintings, and
there's a lot of interest in the others.

1338
01:51:48,694 --> 01:51:51,664
I know it's not much money,
but it is a start.

1339
01:51:51,864 --> 01:51:55,234
I was so excited,
I had to come and tell you.

1340
01:51:55,434 --> 01:51:59,434
- Which one was it? Do you know?
- Suzie, of course.

1341
01:52:00,904 --> 01:52:02,804
Of course.

1342
01:52:06,844 --> 01:52:10,214
I've lost her, Kay. She's gone.

1343
01:52:11,254 --> 01:52:15,214
Well... Oh, well, we'll just have
to find you another model.

1344
01:52:16,154 --> 01:52:18,454
It isn't that simple.

1345
01:52:19,464 --> 01:52:21,324
I love her.

1346
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:23,794
You don't mean it?

1347
01:52:23,994 --> 01:52:27,864
- Why not?
- Well, she...

1348
01:52:28,934 --> 01:52:31,304
You know why.

1349
01:52:33,604 --> 01:52:37,344
Oh, yes, the problem of morals.

1350
01:52:38,344 --> 01:52:42,714
I can't expect you
to understand. I didn't.

1351
01:52:43,654 --> 01:52:47,674
Now I keep asking myself, what
would I have done if I had been she?

1352
01:52:48,624 --> 01:52:51,184
A frightened child, hungry, alone.

1353
01:52:51,824 --> 01:52:55,384
Would I steal to survive? Would I...?

1354
01:52:55,834 --> 01:52:59,794
Just how far would I go
in order to keep on living?

1355
01:53:01,834 --> 01:53:04,464
Suzie learned to pretend.

1356
01:53:04,674 --> 01:53:10,134
Make believe that her body,
her love and her soul were...

1357
01:53:10,874 --> 01:53:13,874
...all separate and apart.

1358
01:53:15,214 --> 01:53:17,874
I could have changed that.

1359
01:53:20,754 --> 01:53:23,694
That's what I didn't understand.

1360
01:53:25,794 --> 01:53:27,764
I'm sorry.

1361
01:53:33,164 --> 01:53:35,964
Get out of those wet clothes
and come over for dinner.

1362
01:53:36,174 --> 01:53:40,804
Father knows a lot of people in
Hong Kong. I'm sure he'd want to help.

1363
01:53:48,854 --> 01:53:51,844
It'd be laughable if it wasn't so filthy.

1364
01:53:52,054 --> 01:53:54,454
I'm forced to compete
with a waterfront tramp.

1365
01:53:54,654 --> 01:53:57,144
This is upsetting.
I've never seen you like this.

1366
01:53:57,354 --> 01:54:00,194
You've never seen me
in love before.

1367
01:54:01,164 --> 01:54:05,624
Please, tell him you'll help him,
then don't. Help me.

1368
01:54:05,834 --> 01:54:09,034
- And if he isn't in love with you, Kay?
- He could be.

1369
01:54:09,234 --> 01:54:12,364
He's the only man in my life
I've ever wanted.

1370
01:54:12,574 --> 01:54:15,544
And if I have to get him
the way she did, I'll do it.

1371
01:54:15,744 --> 01:54:18,904
Now, stop it, Kay.
That's no way to find happiness.

1372
01:54:19,114 --> 01:54:22,774
- Mr. Lomax is here, sir.
- All right, show him in.

1373
01:54:22,984 --> 01:54:26,114
Are you going to help me
or a Wan Chai street-girl?

1374
01:54:26,324 --> 01:54:28,414
I'm going to help my daughter.

1375
01:54:28,624 --> 01:54:30,784
I'm sorry I'm late.
The streets are flooded.

1376
01:54:30,994 --> 01:54:34,014
It's always the same this time
of year. It's these rains.

1377
01:54:34,224 --> 01:54:37,324
Let me get you a drink.
Kay told me about the painting.

1378
01:54:37,534 --> 01:54:39,154
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.

1379
01:54:39,364 --> 01:54:42,464
I also told him about the girl.
He's going to help you.

1380
01:54:42,674 --> 01:54:45,694
Yes, I'll give the commissioner
a description in the morning.

1381
01:54:45,904 --> 01:54:49,304
He might be able to trace her.
But don't you think it might be wiser

1382
01:54:49,514 --> 01:54:55,074
to allow the girl to abide by the decision
she seems to have made herself?

1383
01:54:55,284 --> 01:54:57,514
She doesn't know how I feel now.

1384
01:54:57,714 --> 01:55:00,184
And are you sure
you know how you feel?

1385
01:55:00,384 --> 01:55:01,874
I'd marry her.

1386
01:55:02,094 --> 01:55:05,754
You'd be happy to spend the end
of your days with an old Chinese wife?

1387
01:55:06,694 --> 01:55:10,394
Well, I couldn't prevent growing old,
no matter who I married.

1388
01:55:10,594 --> 01:55:14,164
Robert, I want you to face
some hard realities.

1389
01:55:14,874 --> 01:55:19,834
For example, I couldn't employ a man
in my bank who married such a girl.

1390
01:55:21,514 --> 01:55:25,314
- What happened to your liberalism?
- Oh, I have it.

1391
01:55:25,514 --> 01:55:27,174
I also have a board of directors

1392
01:55:27,384 --> 01:55:29,644
who have wives
with a great deal of bitterness

1393
01:55:29,854 --> 01:55:32,824
because their husbands
have girls like Suzie.

1394
01:55:33,024 --> 01:55:36,254
It's fortunate one doesn't have
to marry your board of directors.

1395
01:55:36,454 --> 01:55:38,924
Father said he'd help you find her.

1396
01:55:39,124 --> 01:55:42,824
Kay, I've got to find her.
I can't eat. I can't paint. I can't sleep.

1397
01:55:43,034 --> 01:55:45,434
Painting Suzie isn't everything.

1398
01:55:45,834 --> 01:55:49,094
If you never painted her again
you wouldn't die.

1399
01:55:54,504 --> 01:55:57,674
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm not fit company tonight.

1400
01:55:57,874 --> 01:55:59,904
But thanks.

1401
01:56:03,914 --> 01:56:05,614
Well, what did I say that was wrong?

1402
01:56:16,894 --> 01:56:19,164
Like this.

1403
01:56:39,484 --> 01:56:41,284
Robert.

1404
01:56:43,224 --> 01:56:44,784
Suzie.

1405
01:56:44,994 --> 01:56:47,424
You've come back. What are
you doing in the rain?

1406
01:56:47,624 --> 01:56:51,424
- You not hate me? We friends still?
- I love you.

1407
01:56:52,004 --> 01:56:54,904
You help me, then.
Houses on hills wash down.

1408
01:56:55,104 --> 01:56:58,904
My baby and Amah in house.
Police not let me get my baby out.

1409
01:56:59,104 --> 01:57:02,134
You come with me, please.
They'll listen to you, Robert.

1410
01:57:02,344 --> 01:57:05,934
Don't worry, we'll get him out.
I promise you that.

1411
01:57:33,204 --> 01:57:37,074
Come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry. Come on.

1412
01:57:38,044 --> 01:57:40,774
Get that road clear.

1413
01:58:33,364 --> 01:58:35,924
You've gotta let us through.
Her baby is up there.

1414
01:58:36,134 --> 01:58:39,834
I'm sorry, mister, nobody
gets through here. Hey, come back!

1415
01:58:47,384 --> 01:58:49,044
- Let us through.
- Not a chance.

1416
01:58:49,254 --> 01:58:51,374
- We've got to.
- It's too dangerous.

1417
01:58:51,584 --> 01:58:54,024
- Who's in charge here?
- Over there.

1418
01:58:54,224 --> 01:58:59,254
Look out, the ground's giving way.
Keep those people moving fast!

1419
01:59:12,704 --> 01:59:15,574
- How can we get up there?
- I'm sorry, it's impossible.

1420
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:18,804
See for yourself, those houses
are coming down like ninepins.

1421
01:59:19,014 --> 01:59:20,874
Stay here.

1422
01:59:21,714 --> 01:59:25,584
Hey, sergeant,
we need more men over there.

1423
01:59:25,784 --> 01:59:29,344
Try the army. Hey, you,
come back! Come back!

1424
01:59:50,144 --> 01:59:52,374
Come on, come on!

1425
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:03,784
Quickly, quickly. Run, run.

1426
02:01:04,784 --> 02:01:07,514
My baby dead.

1427
02:01:08,524 --> 02:01:11,114
My baby dead.

1428
02:01:11,324 --> 02:01:12,854
My baby gone.

1429
02:01:14,094 --> 02:01:18,194
Why ancient gods punish him?
Why not kill me?

1430
02:01:18,404 --> 02:01:21,834
I do bad, not baby.

1431
02:01:24,334 --> 02:01:26,674
Suzie, please,
we've got to get out of here.

1432
02:02:15,794 --> 02:02:20,454
Paper bridge for your baby
to cross over into celestial garden.

1433
02:02:22,094 --> 02:02:26,794
A nice, private sampan
for him to live in.

1434
02:02:31,904 --> 02:02:35,234
Winston fine, first-class baby, Suzie.

1435
02:02:36,074 --> 02:02:40,604
These books, so he not grow up
to be ignorant coolie.

1436
02:02:45,954 --> 02:02:51,894
This nice paper ricksha,
so he not have to walk where he goes.

1437
02:03:06,244 --> 02:03:08,144
Robert.

1438
02:03:08,344 --> 02:03:10,744
I forgot something.

1439
02:03:11,814 --> 02:03:14,574
My baby not know
anybody, where to go.

1440
02:03:14,784 --> 02:03:17,874
You write him letter of introduction?

1441
02:03:18,784 --> 02:03:20,554
Yes.

1442
02:03:21,794 --> 02:03:24,284
What would you like
to have me write?

1443
02:03:30,234 --> 02:03:32,694
Say,

1444
02:03:32,904 --> 02:03:38,704
"This letter introducing
Winston Mee Ling Wong.

1445
02:03:38,904 --> 02:03:41,464
"He very fine gentleman.

1446
02:03:41,674 --> 02:03:46,734
"Not cry too much
and not cause too much trouble.

1447
02:03:46,944 --> 02:03:49,884
"Give him good job, please.

1448
02:03:50,084 --> 02:03:55,454
"Not let him be hungry
and not let him be Ionely.

1449
02:03:57,894 --> 02:04:03,454
"He good friend of Robert Lomax,
very important artist."

1450
02:04:07,704 --> 02:04:13,294
And sign letter,
"Respectfully, Suzie Wong."

1451
02:04:14,604 --> 02:04:17,374
How shall I address it?

1452
02:04:18,074 --> 02:04:22,604
Say, "To whom it may concern."

1453
02:04:36,694 --> 02:04:41,264
Robert, you send letter, personally.

1454
02:04:51,314 --> 02:04:53,974
He has letter now.

1455
02:04:55,314 --> 02:04:59,114
Suzie, marry me.

1456
02:04:59,884 --> 02:05:02,854
Go with me anywhere I go.

1457
02:05:04,724 --> 02:05:08,994
Robert, I be with you

1458
02:05:09,194 --> 02:05:14,894
until you say, "Suzie, go away."

1459
02:05:15,104 --> 02:05:17,334
That long
