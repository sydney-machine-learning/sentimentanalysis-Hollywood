1
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:11,635
- General Houston's arrived, gentlemen.
- Refreshments?

2
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,558
Thank you, Doc.

3
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:20,278
71 cold, windy, rump-bumping miles...
since yesterday!

4
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:22,115
You wouldn't have it
any other way, Lightfoot.

5
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:43,493
Company, stand to!

6
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:48,003
Attention!

7
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:50,757
As you are.

8
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,805
- ¡Don Esparza!
- ¡Mi general!

9
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,686
General Houston, may I
order the men to bivouac?

10
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,567
- The forced marches took it out of them.
- Foot soldiers may.

11
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:02,406
Feed the others, care for their horses...

12
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,329
...and tell them there'll be
another march within the hour.

13
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,167
Yes, sir! Sergeant!

14
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:09,129
- Doctor.
- Sam.

15
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:11,006
- Dickinson.
- General, sir.

16
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:15,932
General, it ain't none of my business,
but you ain't ate since yesterday.

17
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,730
I'll sit it on the table here.

18
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:20,652
Where's Jim Bowie?

19
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:26,286
When certain people ain't ate,
they're meaner than a bobcat!

20
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,175
Mr Dickinson...

21
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,638
I asked you a question.

22
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,856
Where's Jim Bowie?

23
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:40,777
He's indisposed, sir.

24
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:43,699
By God, if you mean drunk,
you say drunk, sir!

25
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:46,580
He's drunk, sir.

26
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:48,460
- What's your name?
- James Butler Bonham.

27
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:52,048
In Travis's command, sir.

28
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:55,475
Hm.

29
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:01,777
Neill, you go north with me.

30
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:03,782
Colonel Travis will be in command here.

31
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,704
- Major, sir.
- Colonel Travis.

32
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,585
- I'll send the commission through.
- Thank you, General.

33
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,468
- Let me assure you I'll do...
- We'll dispense with the amenities. Now...

34
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:17,268
I've been given command
of the armies of Texas.

35
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:21,150
But the fly in the buttermilk is
there ain't no armies in Texas!

36
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,990
A few good friends and some willing men.

37
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:26,870
I'm gonna have to knock
some of those men into an army...

38
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:28,750
...and to do that I need time.

39
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:33,631
You people right here on the real ground
are gonna have to buy me that time.

40
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,432
You have to keep Santa Anna
off the back of my neck...

41
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:40,314
- ...until I can get in shape to fight him.
- So you're ordering me to...

42
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:44,155
Dammit! I am ordering you to command!
How and what you do is your problem!

43
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,995
But, Sam, what about Jim Bowie?

44
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,875
Jim Bowie, as Mr Bonham
has informed us, is indisposed.

45
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,756
Yes, sir. But I'd like to point out...

46
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,637
...that Jim Bowie is leading
a hundred volunteers...

47
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:59,519
...whereas young Travis here
commands less than 30 regulars.

48
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:01,359
27.

49
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,280
General Houston, I think
we oughta discuss this...

50
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:09,163
Clear the room! Gentlemen, I would have
a word with Mr Travis if you'll excuse us.

51
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:11,837
Con permiso.

52
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,407
Mr Travis, were you going to
complain to me about Jim Bowie?

53
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,205
Not complain, sir.

54
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,127
Of course Jim Bowie's drunk.

55
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:34,050
He took this town from General Cos.
He fought a battle.

56
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:35,889
And now he's drunk.

57
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:39,518
Seems kinda natural to me.

58
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:43,651
Or perhaps you question something
other than Bowie's drinking.

59
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:47,492
Are you gonna tell me that he's got
a lot of acreage around here?

60
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:49,331
That he's married into
the Mexican aristocracy?

61
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,210
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:53,132
I would trust Jim Bowie with my life.

63
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:56,054
More than that, I would trust him
with the lives of my family.

64
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:59,934
And more than that, I would trust him
with the life of Texas.

65
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,772
- Sir.
- That's all, Travis.

66
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,277
Travis!

67
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,456
I've never been able to like you.

68
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,338
But you are another one of the very few
men I would trust with the life of Texas.

69
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,136
For that, thank you, sir.

70
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:20,058
And it may very well be...

71
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:24,941
...that that life rests in your hands now.

72
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,785
Jethro! Is that you?

73
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,704
Yes, sir, General. This is me.

74
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,625
How are you still alive?

75
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:56,548
You had white hair when I was a boy
and now we look the same age.

76
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:58,387
Yes, sir.

77
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:03,311
But I've been a temperate and
God-fearing man all my life, sir.

78
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:07,028
Well, I guess my past is out!

79
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:10,910
Jethro, you tell your Mr Jim
I'm sorry to hear about his illness.

80
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,751
I wish him a speedy recovery.

81
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:15,672
And assure him of my undying affection.

82
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:16,550
Yes, sir.

83
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:19,512
And, General Sam, sir, he love you too.

84
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:23,394
And them words of yours
gonna put him right back on his feet.

85
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,234
- He got a colic, you know.
- I heard.

86
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,154
In the stomach.

87
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,075
Stay temperate, old man!

88
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:29,996
Neill!

89
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,957
Column right! Forward!

90
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,420
Yo-ho!

91
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,803
Take care, men!

92
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:31,032
You all right, Mr Jim?

93
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,332
Yeah.

94
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:36,338
Sit down, Jeth.

95
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,273
Ohh!

96
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:47,737
- Can I get you something, sir?
- No, no.

97
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:50,950
You just sit there.

98
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:00,700
Houston's gone?

99
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,409
Yes, sir.

100
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:10,029
Come and gone and me lying drunk.

101
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:22,680
Colonel Travis! Bowie's approaching!

102
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:39,209
Halt!

103
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:43,076
Carry on, sentry!

104
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,491
Recall work parties!

105
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:51,111
Prepare for flag ceremony!

106
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:57,081
Detail! Forward... march!

107
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:26,567
Present... arms!

108
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,003
Order... arms!

109
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,044
We stand here ready to do our duty...

110
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:42,926
...and cognisant of the will of God.

111
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,765
Captain Dickinson!

112
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,686
Dismiss the ceremony!

113
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:51,591
And, Captain, inform the men that
work details will be dismissed at 4.30...

114
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:56,411
...in order that family men may gather
their dependants within these walls.

115
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:57,918
Yes, sir!

116
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,851
- Lieutenant Blake!
- Yes, sir!

117
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,772
You will see to the quartering
of Bowie's volunteers.

118
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:10,609
Yes, sir!

119
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:14,116
You men will follow me!

120
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,215
Jeth, Blake'll show you
to our quarters. Set 'em up.

121
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,805
Yes, sir.

122
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:50,602
Colonel Bowie.

123
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:56,285
Santa Anna's got an army of 7,000 men.

124
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:00,606
So?

125
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:04,469
Well, you ain't gonna try to defend
this broken-down church...

126
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:07,308
...against 7,000 battle-hard troops?

127
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:09,187
Colonel Bowie.

128
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:12,109
You were drunk at the last officers' call.

129
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:15,991
And I would rather postpone
our discussion until the next.

130
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,831
At which time I will explain my plans...

131
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:22,465
...and give orders for
the implementing of those plans.

132
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:48,477
Hey, Jim!

133
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:51,440
Why do we have to work like this?

134
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:54,320
I volunteered to fight, not to build no fort.

135
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:56,199
How come we have to work like this?

136
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:59,121
Because old Sam told Travis,
Travis told me...

137
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,002
...and I'm telling you!

138
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:06,436
Somebody's comin' hellbent for leather,
sinking spurs at every jump!

139
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:11,062
Halt!

140
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,644
Corporal of the guard!

141
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,360
Post No. 1!

142
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:21,118
No civilians may enter the fort,
Señor Seguin. I'm sorry.

143
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:24,047
Juan! Silverio!
Let 'em through, Dick!

144
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:25,677
Captain Dickinson!

145
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:26,905
Yes, sir.

146
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:29,809
- Come to my office, please, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:34,966
Tengo noticias de Santa Anna.

148
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:40,812
Good afternoon, Colonel Travis.
We have news of Santa Anna.

149
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:43,653
- My son and I have...
- Good day, Señor Seguin.

150
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:48,534
Señor, even though you're
the alcalde of San Antonio de Bexar...

151
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:51,291
...it does not exempt you
from military prohibitions.

152
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:54,174
This establishment is closed to all civilians!

153
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:57,055
I'm very sorry, Colonel Travis.

154
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,936
Had I known your restrictions
applied to me and my family, sir...

155
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:03,818
Now, wait a minute, Travis!
The Seguins have news of Santa Anna.

156
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:06,658
- We have a dozen rumours a day.
- You can't just...

157
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,539
Por favor, Juan, tell him.

158
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:11,398
Colonel, the Indians of San Blas...

159
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:16,242
...sent couriers to the vaqueros of
my properties along the Sangre de Cristo.

160
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:19,040
They say many soldiers crossed
the Baja Diablo two days ago.

161
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,921
That puts 'em a lot closer than you thought.

162
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:25,903
The Indians guessed the number
of troops at over 5,000.

163
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:30,174
There are also large numbers of
mounted soldiers and supply trains.

164
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:34,004
Also, lower down on the Baja Diablo
another party of Indians saw signs...

165
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,846
-  ...of shod horses crossing a ford.
- I'm sorry, Señor Seguin.

166
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,987
As a civilian, you cannot realise
how worthless this information is.

167
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:43,827
'Some Indian told some vaqueros...'

168
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:46,748
Anyway, thank you, sir. Good day.

169
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,628
You know the Seguins
are absolutely reliable!

170
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:52,509
- If you'll excuse me.
- I meant no personal offence, señor.

171
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:56,391
But I cannot make a plan
based on third-hand rumours.

172
00:15:56,394 --> 00:16:00,231
I do not take personal affront,
Colonel Travis...

173
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:04,634
...else I should be forced to act
other than to simply bid you good day.

174
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,640
- Adiós, Juan.
- Adiós.

175
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,349
You're a damn fool, Travis.

176
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:02,435
A true gentleman, Seguin.

177
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:07,403
I dislike being rude to him.

178
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,529
Even allowing for exaggeration...

179
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:15,132
...Santa Anna must have
crossed the Baja in strength.

180
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:17,992
But I had to do it, Dick.

181
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:23,876
I'd say we have two or at best
three days before we see his banners.

182
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:25,633
The men were listening.

183
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:31,650
And I can't let that rabble know how weak
we are and how strong the enemy is.

184
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:37,198
- You couldn't do that, eh?
- No, I couldn't.

185
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:41,038
My honest and truthful
and plain-spoken friend.

186
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:43,879
You could, perhaps, but I couldn't.

187
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:45,759
Now, take a look at this.

188
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:47,679
This oblique rampart here...

189
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:52,603
Well, have sense, Dick! Why should
those men stay if they knew the truth?

190
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,402
It's different for Bowie, of course.

191
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:58,323
He's got a big stake in Texas.
A couple of million acres, I hear.

192
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:02,164
- Some of those men haven't got...
- Have you got any dollars or acres?

193
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,710
I've got an extra suit of clothes.
You know that.

194
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:17,457
Boy! So that's it!

195
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:20,128
San Antonio de Bexar.

196
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:23,049
It means Saint Anthony in English.

197
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:25,307
The colonel speaks Spanish, you know.

198
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:33,455
Are you gonna pray, sir?

199
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:36,992
But why, sir?

200
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:40,935
I mean, there wasn't
no doubt we'd find her.

201
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:45,567
The colonel just wasn't sure which one
of these here creeks was the shortest cut.

202
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:47,607
He ain't been here in nigh 15 years.

203
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,456
Better make the signal, boy.

204
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,335
Yes, sir.

205
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:53,557
I hope this powder ain't damp.

206
00:18:53,743 --> 00:18:57,470
You don't take it wrong
I ask you all these questions, Parson?

207
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:00,320
No, boy, that's how you learn. Asking.

208
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:02,199
Yes, sir.

209
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:07,051
So many times every day
you stop and give thanks.

210
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:10,523
Mostly I can't catch on to what
you're thanking the Lord for.

211
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,211
I mean, there's nothin' special.

212
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:14,652
I give thanks for the time and the place.

213
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:16,934
The time and place, Parson?

214
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:21,086
A time to live and a place to die.
That's all any man gets.

215
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,325
No more, no less.

216
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:26,373
- Fire the signal, boy.
- Yes, sir.

217
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:41,662
Must be Parson and the boy!

218
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:45,379
Think so!

219
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,694
Well, there she be, Colonel!

220
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,544
After 20 days of hard ridin'!

221
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:36,566
We gonna have to learn
the lingo they use down here, Davy?

222
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:40,446
Where do we go, Davy?
To the town or to the fort?

223
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,286
There's no fort. It's an old mission.

224
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,209
You better take a better look.
A lot of people movin' in there.

225
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:50,009
Them guns don't give it
no mission look to me.

226
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,846
Colonel...

227
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:56,553
What do C-A-N-T-I-N-A spell?

228
00:20:56,735 --> 00:21:00,572
- Cantina. Do it mean what I think it do?
- It do.

229
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:05,831
It means out of these deerskins
and into our foofaraw!

230
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,913
Hey, you got my coat!

231
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:34,779
Hey, Pedro!

232
00:21:34,906 --> 00:21:36,741
Hand me down that guitar.

233
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:40,663
Now I want you folks to all
clump in here close together.

234
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:43,501
I want you Texicans to open up your ears...

235
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:48,241
...and listen to a little pure Tennessee.

236
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:50,083
# Here's to the ladies...

237
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:52,004
# I love 'em all...

238
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:55,926
# Here's to the ones I recall...

239
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:57,764
# Here's to the ladies...

240
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,684
# Married or free...

241
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,606
# They all look pretty good to me...

242
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,785
# The big and small ones...

243
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:06,706
# The short and tall ones...

244
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,626
# Each one a lovely...

245
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:11,306
Halt!

246
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:13,146
# Here's to the ladies...

247
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:16,108
# I love the ladies...

248
00:22:16,153 --> 00:22:18,989
Captain Dickinson, split your patrol.

249
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:22,871
Send half each way down the river for
about five miles to look for any signs.

250
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,711
- Then report back to the mission.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:28,676
Forward! Yo-ho!

252
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:58,179
Sorry, sir!

253
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:01,518
She sorta come loose!

254
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:05,936
I'd like...

255
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:09,785
- I'd like to speak to David Crockett.
- You did.

256
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,625
That was David Crockett from Tennessee?

257
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,507
Yes, sir. And I oughta know.
Me and him's neighbours back home.

258
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:19,345
Only live 40 mile apart.

259
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,184
Colonel Davy!

260
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,827
- Are you David Crockett, sir?
- That's my name.

261
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:33,710
I'm Colonel Travis,
commanding the garrison.

262
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:34,589
I figured.

263
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:39,178
Well, son, you'd better start growing up.

264
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:44,272
I'd like to speak to you
on a matter of gravest importance.

265
00:23:44,317 --> 00:23:47,862
Sure. Let's find a corner.

266
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:53,206
Talking's dry work!

267
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:01,974
You're learnin' fast!

268
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:06,317
Colonel!

269
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,238
I'm resignin' from you.

270
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:12,118
I'm gonna marry up with Conchita
and be the man of this house.

271
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:13,959
Bésame a kiss, señorita.

272
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:16,881
I toss around a mess
of that proud Spanish, too.

273
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:18,761
Most important part.

274
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:22,600
Let's jig a little, mamacita.

275
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:26,483
Light there and rest easy, Travis...

276
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:29,365
...while I bed down this buck.

277
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:33,704
He just ain't got no head for whiskey!

278
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,646
- Parson!
- Yeah, Davy!

279
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,476
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir!

280
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:47,640
Let's wet our whistles.

281
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,490
Words are dusty.

282
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:52,370
I don't drink.

283
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:55,251
- Not ever?
- No.

284
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:58,131
I've heard of such.

285
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:00,011
Well, spread your wampum, Travis.

286
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:01,932
My title is colonel.

287
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:04,854
Me, I'm a colonel, too.

288
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:07,735
Wouldn't it sound kinda silly,
chattering colonel, colonel...

289
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,616
...like a couple of marsh shield birds?

290
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:13,497
Just speak right up and call me Crockett.

291
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:15,377
Don't bother to use my title.

292
00:25:15,462 --> 00:25:20,300
Old drunken General Flatford gave it
to me in the Choctaw Indian War.

293
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,516
I'll call you Travis.

294
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,820
Very well, Crockett.

295
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:34,660
I'd like your permission
to make a speech to your men.

296
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:38,503
Well, they've heard many a speech
while I was congressifying.

297
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:40,342
What would you talk about?

298
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:44,182
Oh, about freedom... liberty.

299
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:47,202
They don't need any such speech.

300
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:49,003
These men are from Tennessee.

301
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:54,797
I'd like to explain why I want them
to volunteer to fight against Santa Anna.

302
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:56,859
Oh?

303
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,727
Not so careless!

304
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:07,819
You can't get new clothes
this side of Nacogdoches.

305
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,685
Tag!

306
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:16,831
Tennesseans ain't exactly against fighting...

307
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:21,154
...but they ain't much for listening
to speeches. What would you tell them?

308
00:26:21,189 --> 00:26:25,474
Of the many and unendurable hardships
the people have been subjected to...

309
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:30,047
...under the tyrannical government
of this military dictator Santa Anna.

310
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:32,815
We have no rights in the courts,
no market for our produce.

311
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,707
He has forbidden trade with the North.

312
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,836
Davy!

313
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:41,798
I want a chance for my money back.

314
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:45,640
Why don't you leave Davy alone?
He done beat you 38 times hand-runnin'!

315
00:26:45,643 --> 00:26:47,479
36!

316
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,400
38!

317
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,278
36!

318
00:26:51,365 --> 00:26:54,201
This'll only take a minute, Travis.

319
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:57,081
Give me them feathers.

320
00:26:57,126 --> 00:26:59,712
Gentlemen.

321
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:05,863
Balance your feathers.

322
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:10,040
Get set! Go!

323
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:33,541
- Gotcha that time, Davy.
- It was fair and square.

324
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:37,413
- If we can continue, I would like to say...
- One minute, Travis.

325
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,252
That was just for who gets first chance.

326
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:43,675
- Prepare yourself, Davy.
- I'm prepared.

327
00:27:44,138 --> 00:27:46,974
He's still on his feet!

328
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:47,853
Oh, no!

329
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:50,815
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yes!

330
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,863
And it's my turn!

331
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,712
39!

332
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:06,202
He'll never learn!
Let's get a bucket of water.

333
00:28:07,037 --> 00:28:10,150
Kind of a game the boys play
back in Tennessee.

334
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:13,860
Even though time is running out,
I must postpone this interview...

335
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:16,702
...until we can be assured
of no further interruptions.

336
00:28:16,747 --> 00:28:21,551
Step down off your high horse, mister.
You don't get lard less'n you boil the hog.

337
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,527
Have one of these cigars.

338
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:34,119
I brought 'em all the way from New Orleans.

339
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:37,168
Were you going to tell my Tennesseans...

340
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:39,048
...that a good many men...

341
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:40,968
...sound men all...

342
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,891
...had a plot to ease the suffering
of the people in these parts?

343
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:48,732
Or were you going to tell them
that Steve Austin, Houston and others...

344
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:54,533
...and you too, Travis, had planned
to declare for a republic?

345
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,294
To declare this the Republic of Texas?

346
00:28:57,338 --> 00:29:01,550
Were you gonna tell 'em that, Travis?

347
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:04,975
I hadn't thought this was generally known.

348
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,855
It isn't yet.

349
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:11,779
Not till Austin separates
the sheep from the goats.

350
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:15,579
Not till he decides who's on the right side.

351
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,418
Republic.

352
00:29:17,504 --> 00:29:19,339
I like the sound of the word.

353
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,260
It means people can live free...

354
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,139
...talk free...

355
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:26,060
...go or come, buy or sell...

356
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:28,981
...be drunk or sober.
However they choose.

357
00:29:29,024 --> 00:29:31,818
Some words give you a feeling.

358
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:34,701
Republic is one of those words that...

359
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:37,582
...makes me tight in the throat.

360
00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:40,463
Same tightness a man gets when his...

361
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:43,344
...baby takes his first step or...

362
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:46,224
...his first baby shaves...

363
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:50,105
...and makes his first sound like a man.

364
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:55,781
Some words can give you a feeling
that makes your heart warm.

365
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:59,750
Republic is one of those words.

366
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:08,118
Crockett!

367
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,269
I have, I believe, learned
two things about you.

368
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:15,151
Worthwhile, I hope.

369
00:30:15,235 --> 00:30:20,073
You're not the illiterate country bumpkin
you would have people believe.

370
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:23,874
You speak an excellent and
concise English when you wish.

371
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:25,713
The... uh... bad grammar is a pose.

372
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:31,820
A fella has to do a lot to get elected to
Congress. I've kissed many a baby, too.

373
00:30:32,475 --> 00:30:36,550
The other is that you came
to Texas to fight with us.

374
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:39,459
Don't tell my Tennesseans that.

375
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:44,442
They think we came south
to hunt and... get drunk.

376
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:47,199
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

377
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:51,758
They... uh... seem
to have accomplished that.

378
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:46,993
Good evening, my almost-vanishing lady.

379
00:32:47,997 --> 00:32:50,834
- Puedes irte, Juan.
- Sí, Señor Sand.

380
00:32:50,878 --> 00:32:52,672
Trae el equipaje.

381
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,595
This is incredible!
I arranged for this carriage...

382
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,476
I would be heartbroken
if you left Bexar just now.

383
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,356
And even more if you left
with my team of horses...

384
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,236
...which would bring up
a pretty penny in these times...

385
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:07,578
...with two factions
buying anything on four legs.

386
00:33:24,348 --> 00:33:26,183
Do you have business here?

387
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:28,102
I promised Mother.

388
00:33:28,188 --> 00:33:30,023
Your mother?

389
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,902
Pray to the North Star.
Ten minutes every night.

390
00:33:32,948 --> 00:33:35,129
A long line of star-worshippers.

391
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,286
It keeps the rheumatiz away.

392
00:33:40,631 --> 00:33:43,467
It seems to me you're looking for trouble.

393
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:45,889
It do?

394
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:52,100
Let's go upstairs. Unless you prefer
discussing your business...

395
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,710
...in front of every drunken loafer in Bexar.

396
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:58,689
Ándala, pues!

397
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,031
I suppose that overdressed ignoramus...

398
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,965
...is one of the riffraff
here to resist Santa Anna.

399
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,217
They'll find graves and nothing else.
Santa Anna will sweep across...

400
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,656
Overdressed?
I paid good money for these clothes.

401
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:22,934
Why?

402
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:36,724
Lady's luggage.

403
00:34:47,448 --> 00:34:49,634
Gratuity for the boy. You forgot.

404
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:52,287
Dinero.

405
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:05,383
Son, I guess he isn't gonna tip you.

406
00:35:18,437 --> 00:35:20,272
Another thing I promised Mother.

407
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:24,915
Never to get in situations
where people pointed guns at me.

408
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,694
Ma'am, it is possible that I am mistaken...

409
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,617
...but it seems to me you find this
gentleman's company distasteful.

410
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,513
Tell him to get out.

411
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,437
Thank you, sir, but there is no way
in which you could be of help.

412
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:41,614
- And I am in no danger.
- I bid you good night, ma'am.

413
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:44,656
Gratuity for the boy.

414
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:55,093
Your property, sir.

415
00:35:58,187 --> 00:36:00,315
Muchísimas gracias!

416
00:36:21,432 --> 00:36:25,269
We are guaranteed the protection
of the generalissimo himself.

417
00:36:25,274 --> 00:36:28,110
Ah, but please don't misunderstand me.

418
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:29,991
I don't want all of your lands.

419
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:32,912
Half will be sufficient for me.
I'm no glutton.

420
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:36,794
¡Tú eres el más digno
descendiente de la liga de fuerzas!

421
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:38,634
¡El más bajo de los cobardes!

422
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:41,555
¿Pero cómo es posible que
tengas tan poca dignidad?

423
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:44,435
¿Cómo es posible que tengas
tan poca vergüenza?

424
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:49,317
Easy, Graciela, easy! I speak your
language, but that's too fast for me.

425
00:36:49,352 --> 00:36:53,076
Though I dare say
I'm better off not understanding.

426
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:54,917
You actually wanted me to agree to this?

427
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:57,838
This atrocity?!

428
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,719
I actually did and I actually do.

429
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:04,799
You're an educated woman, Graciela.
Intelligent.

430
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:07,640
Is there any other way
to restore your family properties?

431
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:12,063
Santa Anna's administrators rule Potosí.

432
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:14,120
You... you expect me to marry you...

433
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:20,045
...with my father and four brothers newly
buried in Potosí... and my husband?

434
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,803
I expect it because it is the logical course.

435
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:24,683
To marry you? Logical?!

436
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:26,603
Of course!

437
00:37:26,689 --> 00:37:28,524
I am acceptable to Santa Anna.

438
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:33,406
If he should be defeated, I will manage
to become acceptable to his successors.

439
00:37:33,441 --> 00:37:35,205
Oh...

440
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:40,129
That's the trick. To be acceptable
to the powers that be.

441
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:42,928
Let's not pretend
you're a broken-hearted widow.

442
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:44,808
You barely knew the man.

443
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:48,731
The marriage was as much arranged
as this one would be.

444
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:52,571
- Your family picked him up.
- That's the way of my people.

445
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:53,409
You'll say yes.

446
00:37:53,535 --> 00:37:57,189
It's your only possible path.

447
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:00,112
Like all women,
you'll postpone the decision.

448
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:02,410
But you will say yes.

449
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:49,287
Forgive me, ma'am, but I was
having a smoke out on that gallery...

450
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,086
...and I couldn't help but overhear...
I wasn't eavesdropping.

451
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:58,391
But it rankles me when somebody tries
to force somebody to do something.

452
00:38:58,426 --> 00:39:03,691
You haven't seen me before tonight,
but I am offering you my services.

453
00:39:03,726 --> 00:39:06,491
If that fella's making you stay in Bexar...

454
00:39:06,536 --> 00:39:09,372
...I'm ready, willing and able
to provide you...

455
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,251
...a transport to wherever you wanna go.

456
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:15,173
And on the other hand,
if you choose to stay in Bexar...

457
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:21,267
...I'm ready, willing and able
to see that he don't bother you.

458
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,738
Would you answer one question with
complete honesty, Mr... Tall American?

459
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:29,536
Ma'am, only modesty
restrains me from telling you...

460
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:34,307
...that I am widely known
for my truthfulness.

461
00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:40,181
Would you so quickly offer to defend me
if I were 60 years old and wrinkled?

462
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:42,940
Or is it because I am young and a widow...

463
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:48,240
...and you are far from home
and your loved ones?

464
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:54,296
But thank you, anyway, sir.

465
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:57,263
In any event...

466
00:39:57,287 --> 00:40:02,125
...this is a matter in which
no outsider could help.

467
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,025
Mr Tall American!

468
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:09,438
I do believe that a woman in trouble,
even though 60 and wrinkled...

469
00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:11,697
...could turn to you for help.

470
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:16,960
Good night, ma'am.

471
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:46,984
¡Adelante!

472
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:24,338
Ha!

473
00:41:32,012 --> 00:41:33,805
Well, thanks, friend!

474
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,128
If you don't insist on having them
to yourself, I'll give you a hand.

475
00:41:37,132 --> 00:41:38,135
Pleasure, friend.

476
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,710
You must be Jim Bowie.
The size and the shape is as described...

477
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:47,551
...and this knife is certainly
everything I heard it was.

478
00:41:47,596 --> 00:41:50,432
- I'm Bowie.
- I'm Davy Crockett.

479
00:41:50,877 --> 00:41:53,643
Well! I've heard a lot about you!

480
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:56,324
I've heard a lot about you, too.

481
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:58,173
I'd admire to buy you a drink,
or eight or ten.

482
00:41:58,258 --> 00:42:01,219
Oh... Excuse me.

483
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,665
Did you have some trouble with Emil Sand?

484
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,514
- Who's Emil Sand?
- Merchant.

485
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,376
- Tall fella? Butter-coloured hair?
- Yeah, that's him.

486
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:12,175
I've had some words with him.
Intend to have some more.

487
00:42:12,422 --> 00:42:15,258
- How about that drink?
- Honoured, Congressman Crockett!

488
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:18,558
Please, Jim! Don't call me that!
I've been trying to live it down.

489
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,865
Here's your extra coat, Davy. And a jug.

490
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:42,706
Thoughtful. You'd better
get some sleep, Smitty.

491
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,686
I'm not tired.

492
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:46,707
It's Mexico. Exciting night.

493
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,627
Yeah, well, you'd still better get some sleep.

494
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:52,206
All right, Davy.

495
00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:53,047
Night, Smitty.

496
00:42:53,173 --> 00:42:56,135
Good night, Colonel Bowie... Jim.

497
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:03,992
Took a long time for
this night to get unexciting.

498
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:06,748
It sure did.

499
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,754
'Tis a mighty pretty one though.

500
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:13,635
I understand you moved down here
lock, stock, and barrel, Jim.

501
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:18,405
I didn't plan on moving.
Came for a visit and stayed.

502
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,277
- I gather you like it.
- Oh, Davy! If you only knew Mexico!

503
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:24,116
It's wonderful!

504
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:28,039
I thought she was a burnt-over
desert most of the time.

505
00:43:28,043 --> 00:43:31,838
Nah... Most northerners
think that. It ain't so.

506
00:43:31,844 --> 00:43:34,680
Big valleys between high mountains.

507
00:43:34,724 --> 00:43:38,561
Just everything a man could want
in the way of country.

508
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:42,903
For looking at or... or for growing on.

509
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:45,201
But mostly...

510
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:48,122
Mostly it's the people, Davy.

511
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,836
They got...

512
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,883
This is kinda hard to explain, but...

513
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:56,806
...they got courage and they got dignity.

514
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,646
They ain't afraid to die.

515
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,640
What seems most important to me
is that they ain't afraid to live.

516
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:09,931
Today is important to them,
not the dollar tomorrow might bring.

517
00:44:09,966 --> 00:44:12,648
I suppose the Yankee says that's lazy.

518
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:16,573
Me? I say it's a way of livin'.

519
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:19,730
And the womenfolk!

520
00:44:19,816 --> 00:44:21,651
Well, Davy...

521
00:44:21,736 --> 00:44:24,572
I figured you favoured the Mexican ladies.

522
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:27,452
They tell me you married one.

523
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,333
Yeah, I... uh...

524
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,794
I did.

525
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,883
I... uh...

526
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:37,014
Well, Davy, I...

527
00:44:37,098 --> 00:44:43,939
I just ain't got, you know, your way
of putting things into... into words, but...

528
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:47,033
I got a fine family.

529
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,496
A wonderful wife and...

530
00:44:49,581 --> 00:44:52,918
...two fine boys.

531
00:44:53,383 --> 00:44:57,220
I guess I'm what you'd call a lucky man.

532
00:44:57,224 --> 00:45:01,061
Now, that ain't a bad stab
at putting it into words.

533
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:07,696
I, uh, sent them up to Coahuila with
all the trouble around here, you know...

534
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,544
- May I speak privately with you, sir?
- Sure, but...

535
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:15,424
- Aren't you Señora de López?
- Señor Bowie, I'm sorry.

536
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:18,496
- I did not recognise you.
- This place ain't fit for...

537
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:20,344
I know. But the matter is urgent.

538
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,766
Could I have a few private words
with this gentleman?

539
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:25,646
Sure. Excuse me.

540
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:27,567
I'll be inside, Crockett.

541
00:45:27,952 --> 00:45:30,496
Crockett?

542
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:32,526
You are the famous David Crockett?

543
00:45:32,714 --> 00:45:34,549
Well, I'm Crockett.

544
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:39,400
They named me Davy after an uncle
that didn't leave Pa the farm after all.

545
00:45:39,435 --> 00:45:45,274
Mr Crockett, shortly after you left my
room I heard an altercation in the street.

546
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,424
I could hear the sound,
though I could not see from my window.

547
00:45:48,438 --> 00:45:50,663
It sounded like a drunken brawl.

548
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,724
Well, sittin' right here I didn't hear a thing.

549
00:45:53,739 --> 00:45:57,576
Well, anyway, I saw lights
in the old church...

550
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,416
...and people moving about.
And one of them was Emil.

551
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:02,396
And... a thought came to me.

552
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:05,317
As you may know,
Colonel Travis has ordered...

553
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:09,198
...all powder and ball
from the merchants of Bexar.

554
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:11,997
And he didn't find any at Emil's warehouse.

555
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:17,882
It's my opinion... it's all hidden
in the basement of that church.

556
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:19,640
And... Mr Crockett...

557
00:46:19,926 --> 00:46:24,594
The defenders of Texas are going to
need that powder against Santa Anna.

558
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,364
- And you're against Santa Anna?
- Bitterly. Of course.

559
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:30,303
And this... uh... Emil? He's for him?

560
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,294
Yes, he is.

561
00:46:32,308 --> 00:46:35,085
Then, how did he figure you'd marry him?

562
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:37,926
Political arguments
don't flavour folks' supper.

563
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:42,809
Nevertheless, I am going to marry him.
Please let's not discuss it, Mr Crockett.

564
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:45,549
The name is Davy,
and I couldn't sleep nights...

565
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,030
Will you say goodbye for me to Mr Bowie?

566
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:49,840
- Well, I...
- I can make my own way...

567
00:46:49,853 --> 00:46:53,608
...I hope the information is helpful.

568
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,954
Something interesting, Jim.

569
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,878
Parson, round up a couple of the men,
fairly sober, and meet us out in the street.

570
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:18,677
Where are we goin'?

571
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:22,225
- The church.
- Yeah, Davy.

572
00:47:29,384 --> 00:47:31,219
Hey!

573
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:33,724
Parson!

574
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:38,984
- Why'd you run off without me?
- I told him to stay behind. He's drunk.

575
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:41,782
Stick to the point.
Why'd you run off without me?

576
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:43,662
Jim, this is Beekeeper. Jim Bowie.

577
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:45,583
- Hi.
- You can come along.

578
00:47:45,668 --> 00:47:51,507
But hold your breath. Can they smell,
they'll be warned you're coming.

579
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,016
Excuse me.

580
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:14,435
- Grab that torch.
- Yeah.

581
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:26,125
Excuse me.

582
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,181
Well! Here, Parson.

583
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,811
Yes, sir.

584
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,580
- Rifles.
- Must be 50 of 'em!

585
00:49:07,671 --> 00:49:09,506
- Pólvora.
- That's gunpowder.

586
00:49:09,591 --> 00:49:12,427
- Let me take a look at that stuff.
- Watch it!

587
00:49:12,472 --> 00:49:16,851
- Stand back and stand still.
- Excuse me.

588
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:20,109
There must be a ton of it.

589
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:23,991
I'm sure gonna be looking forward
to seeing that soldier boy's face...

590
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:26,140
...when we bring this in.

591
00:51:08,943 --> 00:51:11,779
It's a beautiful morning, Davy Crockett.

592
00:51:12,543 --> 00:51:14,297
It is that...

593
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,139
...María de López y Vejar.

594
00:51:16,225 --> 00:51:18,060
My goodness! You remember all that?

595
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:22,982
Sure. I'm not as stupid
as I look from the outside.

596
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:25,782
- What's Spanish for breakfast?
- Desayuno.

597
00:51:25,827 --> 00:51:28,663
Let's take a paseado out
and get some desayuno.

598
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:31,502
- Paseado?
- That means 'walk'.

599
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:34,385
That means 'have walked'.
But never mind. I'll get dressed.

600
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:37,266
Wait a minute.

601
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:40,146
First, write me a letter.

602
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,346
A letter?

603
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:44,771
- In Spanish.
- Of course.

604
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:47,827
To whom is the letter addressed?

605
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,708
To the Honorable Davy Crockett Esquire.

606
00:51:50,753 --> 00:51:53,589
- You wish a letter written to yourself?
- Yep.

607
00:51:53,634 --> 00:51:56,470
To the Honorable Davy Crockett Esquire...

608
00:51:56,515 --> 00:52:01,353
...former Congressman of
the United States of America.

609
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:04,235
Esteemed sir...

610
00:52:08,036 --> 00:52:11,122
Hurry it up there!

611
00:52:17,598 --> 00:52:22,436
- You've seen Davy?
- Ain't nobody seen Davy. He ain't about.

612
00:52:23,471 --> 00:52:26,779
First lie you've told today, Thimblerig.

613
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:29,037
- Mornin', Davy!
- Howdy!

614
00:52:29,122 --> 00:52:30,958
Say, Davy, what kind
of a load you got there?

615
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:34,378
Presents for some friends.

616
00:52:34,422 --> 00:52:37,425
Let's go, Parson!

617
00:52:58,489 --> 00:53:00,624
Halt! Who goes there?

618
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,245
Is that you, Bob?

619
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,166
Why, sure. Can't you see?

620
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:09,808
Then what kind of idiot nonsense
is this 'Who goes there'?

621
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:12,649
Well, Travis - Colonel Travis, that is -
he says that I should...

622
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:17,667
I don't care what Travis said. Open
the gate before I shoot you off that wall!

623
00:53:21,895 --> 00:53:25,274
Sentry! Open the gate for Colonel Bowie!

624
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,796
Near a ton of good powder here, men!
Get it unloaded!

625
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,677
That long one there, he's Davy Crockett.

626
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:46,559
- And three of his good men.
- Colonel Crockett.

627
00:53:46,562 --> 00:53:48,397
Hello, Travis.

628
00:53:48,483 --> 00:53:50,318
Looks like the answer to a prayer.

629
00:53:50,403 --> 00:53:55,241
Colonel, I'd be pleased if you'd join me
in my quarters for some refreshment.

630
00:53:55,276 --> 00:53:56,748
Proud to.

631
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,355
Oh, and you too,
Colonel Bowie, if you will.

632
00:54:11,528 --> 00:54:14,322
I'm a stranger around these here parts.

633
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:17,205
What do you Texicans use
for drinkin' whiskey?

634
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,162
Drinkin' whiskey.
You got manners or ain't you?

635
00:54:23,872 --> 00:54:27,709
Captain Dickinson,
this is Colonel Davy Crockett.

636
00:54:27,712 --> 00:54:29,548
Morning, Dick.

637
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,470
Oh, and this is my cousin Mrs Dickinson.

638
00:54:32,513 --> 00:54:34,349
- Colonel Crockett.
- Colonel Bowie.

639
00:54:34,434 --> 00:54:37,271
Well, it's nice meeting you,
Davy Crockett.

640
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,151
I feel as if I know you already.

641
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:42,072
You see, part of my family
come from Tennessee...

642
00:54:42,116 --> 00:54:46,955
...and, well, your name is a household
word there. At least in our house it was.

643
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,755
Thank you, ma'am.
It's nice to be well thought of.

644
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:53,345
- Mommy.
- Oh, yes, darling!

645
00:54:53,601 --> 00:54:56,437
Oh! I've asked you
not to climb those stairs alone.

646
00:54:56,482 --> 00:55:00,319
- Well, who's this?
- You say hello to Colonel Crockett?

647
00:55:00,321 --> 00:55:02,156
Hello.

648
00:55:02,242 --> 00:55:05,078
Every size they get to
seems to be the most lovable.

649
00:55:05,123 --> 00:55:08,876
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

650
00:55:08,964 --> 00:55:10,799
Goodbye, Colonel.

651
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:12,720
Goodbye.

652
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:15,641
Kind of a shame
kids have to grow up into people.

653
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:20,399
It's good we're all here, gentlemen.
A cigar?

654
00:55:22,408 --> 00:55:24,243
Please, make yourselves comfortable.

655
00:55:24,328 --> 00:55:28,165
I have some news.
Fannin is doing well at Goliad.

656
00:55:28,169 --> 00:55:30,004
He has mustered almost a thousand men...

657
00:55:30,089 --> 00:55:33,884
...and should be ready to move south
by the first of the week.

658
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,726
A thousand? It don't seem possible.

659
00:55:36,771 --> 00:55:39,607
It does sound too good to be true,
I must confess.

660
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:41,487
But we can only admit
our doubts to each other.

661
00:55:41,573 --> 00:55:45,410
In the privacy of a room
and not in front of the men.

662
00:55:45,414 --> 00:55:49,842
As far as the volunteers are concerned,
we're sure Fannin has a thousand men.

663
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,049
- I got a reputation for truth, Travis.
- I ain't.

664
00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:55,930
Everybody says I'm a born liar.

665
00:55:55,975 --> 00:56:00,813
But whether we talk out loud or quiet
don't seem to me the point right now.

666
00:56:00,848 --> 00:56:04,613
The point is how many men has Fannin
and will he get here in time?

667
00:56:04,616 --> 00:56:09,454
Whether he does or doesn't,
we'll be trapped here. And for no reason.

668
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:12,212
We should burn all of Bexar,
including this mission.

669
00:56:12,258 --> 00:56:16,095
And annoy Santa Anna while he sweeps
north across the whole of Texas?

670
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:18,935
- That's Colonel Bowie's theory!
- We could hit and run!

671
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,485
Jump him at every creek crossing...

672
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:23,677
- You seem to forget one thing, Colonel!
- What? - That I command!

673
00:56:23,682 --> 00:56:27,395
And I have already
decided against your plan!

674
00:56:29,544 --> 00:56:31,380
Now...

675
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:33,300
Let us attack a more important problem.

676
00:56:33,385 --> 00:56:36,222
Colonel Crockett's Tennesseans.

677
00:56:36,264 --> 00:56:38,100
Will they fight, Colonel?

678
00:56:38,184 --> 00:56:43,023
Last time I saw 'em they hadn't shown
any strong feelings against fighting.

679
00:56:43,058 --> 00:56:46,824
- Can you persuade them to come here?
- I can ask them.

680
00:56:46,827 --> 00:56:50,665
And you're a very persuasive man
according to your reputation.

681
00:56:50,669 --> 00:56:54,465
Build up the story that Fannin has
a thousand... no, two thousand men.

682
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:58,308
- Play down the size of Santa Anna's...
- We've been all through this.

683
00:56:58,312 --> 00:57:01,148
He wants me to lie to my men, too.
Keep 'em here with lies.

684
00:57:01,192 --> 00:57:05,029
Let the truth of Santa Anna's strength
be known and there won't be a dozen left!

685
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:08,870
- You calling my boys cowards?
- Let us dispense with the pyrotechnics!

686
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:12,710
Remember this. My men are volunteers!
They're here because they wanna be!

687
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:16,095
But there's nothing to keep 'em
from gettin' outta here!

688
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:22,314
I'm aware that your men are militia.

689
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:24,153
And, like all volunteers, undisciplined.

690
00:57:24,238 --> 00:57:27,658
Good day, Colonel Bowie.

691
00:57:34,161 --> 00:57:40,000
Last night gave you a pretty good idea
of the discipline of my men.

692
00:57:40,035 --> 00:57:43,759
Our position here is desperate.

693
00:57:43,763 --> 00:57:49,477
And I feel sure that where
Crockett leads, his men will follow.

694
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,189
Yeah.

695
00:57:51,745 --> 00:57:57,167
That's a responsibility that's...
been kinda worrying me.

696
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:04,084
Thank you, gentlemen.
I'm gonna pass the word around.

697
00:58:04,129 --> 00:58:07,966
What you Texans use for
drinkin' whiskey... is drinkin' whiskey.

698
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:11,765
And what's more important,
you got real good manners...

699
00:58:11,769 --> 00:58:17,608
...seein' how you suffer the handicap
of having never been in Tennessee.

700
00:58:17,943 --> 00:58:21,668
Hey Davy, is it true that you fit
a four-day fight with Mike Fink?

701
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:24,508
Why, that's a blasted lie!

702
00:58:24,553 --> 00:58:28,391
One of them stories
loose-mouthed people tell around.

703
00:58:28,395 --> 00:58:30,231
Mike and me quit at sundown!

704
00:58:30,315 --> 00:58:34,153
Wouldn't have been the fourth day
until, uh... next morning.

705
00:58:34,157 --> 00:58:34,992
See you, men!

706
00:58:35,117 --> 00:58:38,329
Let her rip, Parson!

707
00:58:56,303 --> 00:58:58,138
Señora López.

708
00:58:58,223 --> 00:59:00,058
Don Juan, this is Mr Davy Crockett.

709
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:01,979
- I'm honoured.
- How do you do?

710
00:59:02,064 --> 00:59:06,902
Señor Seguin is the alcalde... I mean,
the mayor of San Antonio de Bexar.

711
00:59:06,937 --> 00:59:08,700
He's got a pretty busy town.

712
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:11,622
People are running like sheep
that have smelled a wolf pack.

713
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:14,503
I never said no such a thing!

714
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:19,386
When us took that powder in there, that
fella Travis asked if us Tennesseans...

715
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:22,184
...was gonna join up with him. That's all.

716
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:25,065
He never asked us to fight his fight for him.

717
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:27,945
- Have some breakfast.
- Breakfast?! Tortillas?

718
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:30,409
Tamale!

719
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:35,586
Never get burnt drinking this stuff.

720
00:59:35,631 --> 00:59:39,468
Well, I only know part of Texas and
none of these Texicans is related to me...

721
00:59:39,472 --> 00:59:42,308
...so why should I fight for them?

722
00:59:42,353 --> 00:59:45,189
Right. Ain't our ox that's gettin' gored.

723
00:59:45,234 --> 00:59:49,071
Talkin' about whose ox
gets gored... figure this.

724
00:59:49,074 --> 00:59:53,912
A fella gets in the habit of goring oxes,
whets his appetite.

725
00:59:53,947 --> 00:59:56,711
He may come up north next
and gore yours.

726
00:59:56,756 --> 01:00:00,927
Men, we're in a little fix, sort of.

727
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:05,394
The he-bull around here -
General Santa Anna. He's mad at us.

728
01:00:05,399 --> 01:00:07,234
Yeah?

729
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:09,154
He's wrote us a letter.

730
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,075
I can't read it. It's in Spanish.

731
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,580
But the young lady will.

732
01:00:23,862 --> 01:00:28,841
It is addressed to Davy Crockett and
the Tennesseans who accompany him.

733
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,640
Be it known:

734
01:00:30,725 --> 01:00:34,563
You are interlopers in a country where
you are neither wanted nor welcome.

735
01:00:34,566 --> 01:00:37,403
This is the order you are given.

736
01:00:37,447 --> 01:00:41,285
Depart with all haste and at once,
because it has come to our attention...

737
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:46,126
...that you are possibly considering joining
the rebels now skulking in the mission.

738
01:00:46,161 --> 01:00:49,927
This is not your fight. Depart.

739
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:53,626
Should you fail to abide by this order...

740
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,467
...I shall chastise you even unto death.

741
01:00:56,512 --> 01:01:00,808
Signed: Generalissimo
Antonio Miguel de Santa Anna.

742
01:01:02,074 --> 01:01:03,289
Huh!

743
01:01:03,294 --> 01:01:06,130
Fella kinda fancies himself, don't he?

744
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:09,011
Sure does have a big-sounding name.

745
01:01:09,055 --> 01:01:12,892
Givin' us orders. Who do he think he am?
Andy by God Jackson?

746
01:01:12,897 --> 01:01:17,735
Riles me when somebody tells me
to go here or I can't go there.

747
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,533
I ain't never been run out of no place!

748
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:23,456
Except the time my old paw
kicked me over every acre...

749
01:01:23,459 --> 01:01:26,295
...of that half-section back there in Ohio.

750
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:29,175
But I was just a shirt-tail kid then.
My paw had big feet.

751
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,014
What do you say, Davy?
Are we gonna let this man...

752
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:34,897
...tell us what we can or can't do?

753
01:01:34,942 --> 01:01:40,614
Davy, maybe we'd better saddle up
and pay this fella a visit.

754
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:45,501
- Do chastise mean what I think it do?
- It do.

755
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:50,343
Davy, let's do saddle up and go learn
that gentleman his manners.

756
01:01:50,378 --> 01:01:55,145
We won't have to. He's wearin' out
horses comin' toward us.

757
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:58,344
Well, I guess we can't
stop him from coming.

758
01:01:58,388 --> 01:02:01,224
But I reckon we can arrange
for him to limp going back.

759
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:06,107
I was thinking these Texicans
wasn't as neighbourly as they might be.

760
01:02:06,142 --> 01:02:09,907
But here they've gone and arranged
a nice fight for us visitors.

761
01:02:09,912 --> 01:02:13,707
One thing I oughta tell you.
Santa Anna never wrote that letter.

762
01:02:13,713 --> 01:02:15,548
I did.

763
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:18,468
Or rather... I had this lady here write it.

764
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:22,350
I was figuring how to tell you fellas
about this Texican hoedown.

765
01:02:22,354 --> 01:02:27,192
I wondered what Santa Anna would've
said to us if he'd had a chance to say it.

766
01:02:27,227 --> 01:02:29,993
Davy, I ain't never said
I ain't been whupped. I have.

767
01:02:30,036 --> 01:02:33,874
But I give every one of them fellas
a chance to dig in and get the job done.

768
01:02:33,877 --> 01:02:37,715
But I ain't never took nobody's word
that they was gonna chas...

769
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:40,556
- Chastise.
- Chastise. Much obliged.

770
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:43,436
- We're gonna stay, ain't we?
- I'm thinking it over.

771
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,317
What is there to think about?
You getting that old?

772
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,196
The man toed the mark and dared us!

773
01:02:48,281 --> 01:02:52,077
- Chastise, he said!
- That's right! Chastise!

774
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:54,919
- But I wrote the letter!
- Don't you start weaslin'.

775
01:02:54,964 --> 01:02:59,802
You said them'd be the words he'd write
if he was to write us a letter.

776
01:02:59,837 --> 01:03:01,601
Well, gentlemen, you've convinced me.

777
01:03:01,685 --> 01:03:03,520
We'll fight.

778
01:03:03,606 --> 01:03:07,443
- That's more like it!
- Now you're talkin', Davy!

779
01:03:07,446 --> 01:03:09,281
First, the young lady and I
will take a pasear.

780
01:03:09,367 --> 01:03:13,204
Gather up your possibles
and I'll meet up with you later.

781
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:17,670
- Con permiso.
- Your Spanish is improving.

782
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,806
It kinda cheers me to see
the colonel with that lady.

783
01:03:21,851 --> 01:03:25,688
Last couple of years he had me worried.

784
01:03:25,692 --> 01:03:28,929
Lately he ain't been looking
at the girls like he was starved.

785
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:31,646
Being in Congress
has ruined many a good man.

786
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:43,391
All I hear is Crockett the bear-killer...

787
01:03:43,436 --> 01:03:46,272
Crockett the Indian-fighter...

788
01:03:46,317 --> 01:03:48,152
Crockett the brawler...

789
01:03:48,237 --> 01:03:50,072
Crockett has brains.

790
01:03:50,158 --> 01:03:52,994
Kept it hidden a number of years.

791
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,875
- You like my Tennesseans, Flaca?
- Oh, yes.

792
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:59,756
Could strain 10,000
and never come up with 23 better.

793
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,598
Every one of those men has been
at my elbow, save the boy Smitty...

794
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:07,398
...when some difficulty arose.

795
01:04:07,442 --> 01:04:12,238
Some of them don't bathe as often
as polite folks would think necessary.

796
01:04:12,273 --> 01:04:15,666
But every one of them smells sweet to me.

797
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:21,243
And I was the one that said
this country was burnt-over sand.

798
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:24,041
It's green and growing.

799
01:04:24,086 --> 01:04:28,591
Like those green pastures they talk about.

800
01:04:28,888 --> 01:04:33,184
Lord above! That's one beautiful tree!

801
01:04:55,636 --> 01:04:57,471
This tree must've been growed...

802
01:04:57,556 --> 01:05:03,228
...before man put his first
dirty footprints on this prairie.

803
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:08,159
Kind of a tree Adam and Eve
must have met under.

804
01:05:17,061 --> 01:05:19,627
You know something, Flaca?

805
01:05:19,642 --> 01:05:21,477
I guess I saw who knows how many trees...

806
01:05:21,562 --> 01:05:25,399
...before I ever took
a long, thoughtful look at one.

807
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:30,100
Mostly I looked at a tree to see was there
a bear in it or an Indian behind it.

808
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:35,922
Davy, what's going to happen to us?

809
01:05:35,926 --> 01:05:38,762
I mean, to you and me.

810
01:05:38,807 --> 01:05:41,643
I'm gonna tell you something, Flaca,
and I want you to listen tight.

811
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:45,524
It may sound like I'm talking about me,
but I'm talkin' about you.

812
01:05:45,528 --> 01:05:48,364
In fact, I'm talking about
all people everywhere.

813
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:52,246
When I came down here to Texas,
I was looking for something.

814
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:55,086
I didn't know what.

815
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,965
It seems like you added up my life...

816
01:05:57,051 --> 01:06:02,890
...and I'd spent it all either stomping other
men or in some cases getting stomped.

817
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,649
Had me some money
and had me some medals.

818
01:06:05,694 --> 01:06:10,532
But none of it seemed a lifetime
worth the pain of the mother that bore me.

819
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,289
It's like I was empty.

820
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:14,211
Well, I'm not empty any more.

821
01:06:14,296 --> 01:06:17,132
That's what's important.

822
01:06:17,177 --> 01:06:19,012
To feel useful in this old world.

823
01:06:19,096 --> 01:06:23,934
To hit a lick against what's wrong,
or to say a word for what's right...

824
01:06:23,969 --> 01:06:27,736
...even though you get walloped
for sayin' that word.

825
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:31,577
I may sound like a Bible-beater
yellin' up a revival at a camp meeting...

826
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:34,417
...but that don't change the truth none.

827
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:37,298
There's right and there's wrong.
You gotta do one or the other.

828
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:40,179
You do the one and you're living.

829
01:06:40,223 --> 01:06:44,472
You do the other and you may be walking
around, but you're dead as a beaver hat.

830
01:06:48,864 --> 01:06:53,661
I'd hoped for a horse, but there's
nothing wrong with a good strong mule.

831
01:06:53,696 --> 01:06:56,212
My things!

832
01:06:56,507 --> 01:06:58,342
All my luggage is in the buggy!

833
01:06:58,428 --> 01:07:00,263
Had my men take care of it.

834
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:05,646
Your geegaws may be rough-packed
but they're all there.

835
01:07:09,949 --> 01:07:13,786
You are sending me away. You...

836
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:17,628
You talked about the fight
against evil but you...

837
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:21,427
You are sending me to safety.

838
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:24,408
Flaca, you have an important name.

839
01:07:24,453 --> 01:07:27,289
You know a million words
and how they should be used.

840
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:32,130
I'm sending you to fight your war,
to talk up a howling mob.

841
01:07:32,165 --> 01:07:35,890
I'll stay here and hit a lick.

842
01:07:36,896 --> 01:07:38,731
I hope you can drive a mule.

843
01:07:38,816 --> 01:07:40,651
His name's Jesús, they told me.

844
01:07:40,737 --> 01:07:44,491
He seems a good, honest mule.

845
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:53,475
Maybe I'll never see you again.

846
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,356
If that's what's written,
that's what's written.

847
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:58,236
When it's time, it's time.

848
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:01,157
Talkin' only makes it the harder, Flaca.

849
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,037
So stir up that mule.

850
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:05,708
Davy, I...

851
01:08:18,547 --> 01:08:22,301
You never pray, do you, Davy?

852
01:08:24,968 --> 01:08:28,347
I never found the time.

853
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:54,219
Sir! Tennesseans.

854
01:08:59,737 --> 01:09:02,573
Colonel Travis!

855
01:09:02,618 --> 01:09:04,871
Crockett and his men.

856
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:09,685
Go down and open the gate.

857
01:09:09,701 --> 01:09:11,536
I'll just holler down.

858
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:15,148
Your orders were to go down,
not holler down, Mr Dennison!

859
01:09:15,262 --> 01:09:16,806
Yes, sir.

860
01:09:32,346 --> 01:09:34,041
Crack shots, those Tennesseans.

861
01:09:34,127 --> 01:09:37,734
Twenty times their number's
is what we need, and more.

862
01:09:37,737 --> 01:09:41,704
Oh, I'm sorry, Will. Such gloomy
remarks are for your ears alone.

863
01:09:42,009 --> 01:09:44,357
Isn't that Bowie galloping up to catch 'em?

864
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:52,327
I can just hear him pleading his cause.

865
01:09:52,372 --> 01:09:55,208
Crockett seems to me the type of man
that would choose Bowie.

866
01:09:55,253 --> 01:09:58,089
What you mean is Crockett
isn't the type of man to choose me.

867
01:09:58,134 --> 01:10:01,421
Oh, Will. Depend on you
to say it the most brutal way.

868
01:10:01,473 --> 01:10:03,810
Most facts are brutal!

869
01:10:08,396 --> 01:10:11,232
Just look at that great knife fighter
yapping at Crockett.

870
01:10:11,277 --> 01:10:14,071
Cut, slash, and run!

871
01:10:14,117 --> 01:10:16,953
Let's get mounted. Cut, slash, and run!

872
01:10:16,998 --> 01:10:18,713
Cut, slash, and run.

873
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,556
Cost Santa Anna a hundred troops
at every creek crossing...

874
01:10:22,559 --> 01:10:24,394
...between here and the North.

875
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,317
Sounds reasonable the way you put it...

876
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:30,198
...but Travis has a point, too.
Takes thinkin' on.

877
01:10:30,242 --> 01:10:31,077
Hey, Jim!

878
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:33,037
Halt! Who goes there?

879
01:10:33,122 --> 01:10:37,961
Bob, I swear I'm gonna shoot you
off that wall. Are you blind?

880
01:10:37,996 --> 01:10:39,759
That's what I was told to holler every time.

881
01:10:39,844 --> 01:10:42,681
Well, don't holler at me!

882
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:43,960
Idiot.

883
01:10:44,085 --> 01:10:46,673
You think on it, Davy. You'll side with me.

884
01:10:57,027 --> 01:10:58,732
What is it?

885
01:10:58,748 --> 01:11:02,585
Tennesseans, Nell. 23 of 'em.
All the way from home.

886
01:11:02,589 --> 01:11:06,426
Do you recognise any, Jocko?
Is my brother Malachi with them?

887
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:09,205
He was a fella to go
where there was trouble.

888
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,425
He was that.

889
01:11:10,531 --> 01:11:12,366
But, Nell, you know Malachi was hung.

890
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:14,954
Or so some folks told us.

891
01:11:17,632 --> 01:11:22,451
Colonel Crockett. I am glad you were able
to persuade your men to join us.

892
01:11:22,466 --> 01:11:24,369
Well, they insisted, sort of.

893
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:27,711
Our heartiest welcome!

894
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:29,591
Ladies and gentlemen...

895
01:11:29,676 --> 01:11:33,361
...we are proud to welcome
these patriotic men...

896
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:37,014
...who have travelled 1500 miles
to join us in our hour of need.

897
01:11:37,016 --> 01:11:38,851
- Sergeant Lightfoot!
- Yes, sir?

898
01:11:38,937 --> 01:11:42,774
You will have your men
raise a cheer for our gallant allies...

899
01:11:42,778 --> 01:11:45,614
- ...from the illustrious state of Tennessee!
- Yes, sir!

900
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:48,495
- Hip! Hip!
- Hooray!

901
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,375
- Hip! Hip!
- Hooray!

902
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:53,057
- Hip! Hip!
- Hooray!

903
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:57,079
Captain, you will attend to
the billeting of these men.

904
01:11:57,083 --> 01:12:02,922
After you are quartered, I will take you
on a tour of the emplacements.

905
01:12:02,957 --> 01:12:05,056
This way, gentlemen.

906
01:12:07,646 --> 01:12:11,066
Crockett! Davy Crockett!

907
01:12:11,486 --> 01:12:15,281
- We're from Tennessee.
- Well, howdy, folks!

908
01:12:15,287 --> 01:12:17,963
We seen you when you came
to Stink Wells...

909
01:12:17,968 --> 01:12:19,683
...to speak about that job for the Congress.

910
01:12:19,689 --> 01:12:22,525
- You shook hands with me.
- I'll do her again.

911
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,106
He didn't vote for you, though.

912
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,896
- Other fella gave him four bits.
- I'm sorry.

913
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,508
Don't be. Glad there were
enough sensible folks like you...

914
01:12:31,512 --> 01:12:33,348
...to vote me out of that job.

915
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:37,270
Well, later on we'll have
a real old home talkfest.

916
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:41,197
Right now we've got to get quartered
and bedded down. Would you excuse us?

917
01:12:43,995 --> 01:12:46,208
You should have voted for him, Jocko.

918
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:50,250
¡Soldados! ¡Soldados!

919
01:13:11,443 --> 01:13:15,196
¡Columna a la izquierda!

920
01:13:28,827 --> 01:13:33,623
Of our 24 pieces of ordnance,
five are these six-pounders.

921
01:13:34,258 --> 01:13:35,943
Something's stirring in town!

922
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:46,316
Ladies will take cover, please!

923
01:13:46,431 --> 01:13:50,226
Men, to your battle positions!

924
01:14:11,398 --> 01:14:14,192
¡Los documentos!

925
01:14:14,739 --> 01:14:16,544
Los documentos.

926
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,607
- Teniente, cumpla con sus órdenes.
- Sí, señor.

927
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,782
Captain Dickinson,
are your men disposed?

928
01:14:45,826 --> 01:14:47,288
At their posts, sir!

929
01:14:52,507 --> 01:14:55,343
No one will fire unless I so order!

930
01:14:55,388 --> 01:14:58,810
Those people are under
the protection of a flag of truce.

931
01:15:05,551 --> 01:15:08,387
¡Columna alto!

932
01:15:12,173 --> 01:15:17,011
From Generalissimo Antonio López de
Santa Anna, absolute ruler of Mexico...

933
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:19,810
...to the rebel commander
who deems himself in command...

934
01:15:19,855 --> 01:15:22,691
...of the rebels occupying the mission.

935
01:15:22,735 --> 01:15:24,570
Be it known:

936
01:15:24,656 --> 01:15:27,492
The province of Mexico known as Texas...

937
01:15:27,537 --> 01:15:31,302
...has shown itself to be
in active and treasonous revolt...

938
01:15:31,308 --> 01:15:33,604
...against the rule of
Generalissimo Santa Anna.

939
01:15:33,619 --> 01:15:36,584
The generalissimo issues
the following order.

940
01:15:36,609 --> 01:15:40,376
All occupants of the mission
will leave at once...

941
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:43,136
...leaving all arms
and ammunition behind them.

942
01:15:43,161 --> 01:15:45,997
If this order is not followed with dispatch...

943
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,877
...the generalissimo will reduce
the mission by assault.

944
01:15:48,922 --> 01:15:51,801
There will be no quarter given.

945
01:16:00,245 --> 01:16:02,080
¡Columna a la derecha!

946
01:16:02,366 --> 01:16:03,910
¡Marchen!

947
01:16:24,512 --> 01:16:28,266
Well, what do you think, Jim?

948
01:16:29,312 --> 01:16:34,512
I hate to say anything good about
that long-winded jackanapes...

949
01:16:34,707 --> 01:16:39,840
...but he does know
the short way to start a war.

950
01:17:01,821 --> 01:17:03,532
The Sixth...

951
01:17:04,602 --> 01:17:07,564
The Sixth Vera Cruzano Fusiliers.

952
01:17:11,945 --> 01:17:15,662
They're bivouacking about
a mile south of our west bastion.

953
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:18,502
Light artillery, lancers, some engineers.

954
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:23,384
Not one unit of heavy assault troops yet,
and it still adds up to 2,000 men.

955
01:17:23,419 --> 01:17:26,183
That'll be to our advantage, Dick.

956
01:17:26,228 --> 01:17:30,065
That main body must be
strung out for miles.

957
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:33,865
The assault infantry,
heavy artillery and supply trains...

958
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:35,705
They won't be here for four or five days.

959
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:38,626
The actual battle can't start until then.

960
01:17:38,671 --> 01:17:42,508
Oh, there'll be an occasional sortie
feeling out our defences.

961
01:17:42,712 --> 01:17:47,550
But they won't commit to an attack until
Santa Anna is here with his main force.

962
01:17:47,685 --> 01:17:50,909
- Then what?
- Then Fannin will be here.

963
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:59,252
More troops arriving every hour.

964
01:17:59,397 --> 01:18:02,233
Prettiest army I ever did see.

965
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:04,132
Yeah.

966
01:18:04,298 --> 01:18:07,134
If I take my men out, do you go with me?

967
01:18:07,438 --> 01:18:11,015
Davy, you know this old mission
can't stand up to Santa Anna's army.

968
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,853
- My way's the only way.
- Travis says that Fannin's coming.

969
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:19,492
Travis says! I wouldn't take Travis's
word that night's dark and day's light.

970
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:23,337
Blowin' on a horn. That's all.

971
01:18:23,463 --> 01:18:26,299
Chicken in the bread bag,
pickin' up the corn. That's all.

972
01:18:26,344 --> 01:18:29,181
Flies in the buttermilk.
Shoo, fly, shoo! That's all.

973
01:18:29,225 --> 01:18:32,062
Ants in the sugar bowl.
Two by two. That's all.

974
01:18:32,105 --> 01:18:35,274
- I carried twice as much!
- You're twice as big.

975
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:40,418
Patrol's in trouble!

976
01:18:58,092 --> 01:18:59,927
Doggone it, Beekeeper!

977
01:19:00,013 --> 01:19:03,850
I thought you wasn't gonna open
that corn liquor till nightfall!

978
01:19:03,854 --> 01:19:07,691
It's only a half-hour till dark.

979
01:19:07,695 --> 01:19:10,531
Besides, it's my keg, ain't it?

980
01:19:10,576 --> 01:19:12,411
Well, all right. Give me some of that stuff!

981
01:19:12,496 --> 01:19:15,332
I'm so scared I could drink all of it!

982
01:19:15,377 --> 01:19:17,212
Maybe I will.

983
01:19:17,898 --> 01:19:19,564
What'd you see, Irish?

984
01:19:19,978 --> 01:19:22,814
More than I wanted to, Jim.
A lot of men arriving.

985
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:26,596
And they got the durned
blastedest cannon ever I did see!

986
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,811
Something like this.

987
01:19:34,442 --> 01:19:37,018
12 or 14 foot long maybe!

988
01:19:37,123 --> 01:19:39,959
- He sure draws pretty, don't he?
- Frightening!

989
01:19:40,103 --> 01:19:43,289
12 or 14 feet long. Are you sure, Irish?

990
01:19:43,484 --> 01:19:45,319
- Well, yeah...
- Finn!

991
01:19:45,604 --> 01:19:46,619
Yes, sir!

992
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:50,462
You were ordered to report to me,
not to hold lecture courses. Get up here!

993
01:19:50,466 --> 01:19:53,845
All right, Will... uh... Colonel Travis.

994
01:19:57,188 --> 01:19:59,023
Hey, Travis! With a cannon like that...

995
01:19:59,109 --> 01:20:03,947
...them Santa Anna fellas can just sit up
there and give us what for, can't they?

996
01:20:03,982 --> 01:20:06,746
There's no such cannon
in the North American continent.

997
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:09,667
They have some in Europe,
according to last reports.

998
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:12,466
Acting Lieutenant Finn is exaggerating.

999
01:20:13,571 --> 01:20:14,990
¡Fuego!

1000
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:25,576
She's a big one, Davy!
And she's shooting from over here!

1001
01:20:33,437 --> 01:20:36,274
Battery One! Is your gun ready?

1002
01:20:36,318 --> 01:20:38,034
We're primed and ready, sir!

1003
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:39,765
Give it full elevation!

1004
01:20:39,799 --> 01:20:41,124
Yes, sir!

1005
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,056
The gun is ready, sir!

1006
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:50,435
Fire!

1007
01:20:57,104 --> 01:21:00,400
Kinda short there, Colonel, Mr Travis!

1008
01:21:06,147 --> 01:21:10,985
I'm sure I'm glad I seen that there cannon
sitting out there on that prairie.

1009
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:13,784
For a minute I thought
they was shooting at us...

1010
01:21:13,829 --> 01:21:15,664
...from one of them countries
over in Europe.

1011
01:21:15,749 --> 01:21:17,584
Oh, my goodness!

1012
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,939
No!

1013
01:21:20,651 --> 01:21:23,487
Oh, no! They wouldn't dare!

1014
01:21:23,531 --> 01:21:28,119
Man, that ain't no fair way to fight a war!

1015
01:21:32,133 --> 01:21:35,970
Well, I guess we'd better do
somethin' about that, Crockett.

1016
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,810
- Plain as can be.
- About an hour after dark?

1017
01:21:38,855 --> 01:21:40,690
Good.

1018
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:42,611
Thimblerig, 15 men.

1019
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:44,532
Right after dark.

1020
01:21:44,617 --> 01:21:47,203
All sober.

1021
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,134
Boo!

1022
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,936
- Halt!
- I lost the bet.

1023
01:22:00,941 --> 01:22:03,777
I bet my friends I could sneak up
on you without you hearing me.

1024
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:06,450
Friend, you like to got a hole in your head.

1025
01:22:08,621 --> 01:22:09,790
Ha!

1026
01:22:11,661 --> 01:22:15,250
- Tie him loose.
- Kick that fire out and kill our silhouette.

1027
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,144
Let's go. Company One, let's go!

1028
01:22:33,547 --> 01:22:35,383
- Everything set?
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:22:35,467 --> 01:22:37,303
All right. It's time, men.

1030
01:22:37,388 --> 01:22:41,226
- Open the gate!
- Colonel Travis, sentry here!

1031
01:22:41,329 --> 01:22:44,166
- Somebody jumped me!
- I'll say they did!

1032
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:49,079
Shoved me down, tied me up, and
some of them stepped on me goin' by.

1033
01:22:49,084 --> 01:22:53,629
And never so much as
a by-your-leave from every one of them.

1034
01:22:53,644 --> 01:22:54,992
Dammit!

1035
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:01,350
- Return to your posts.
- Yes, sir.

1036
01:23:01,354 --> 01:23:04,273
Close the gate!

1037
01:23:06,256 --> 01:23:09,092
Well, you'd better get
your men mounted, then.

1038
01:23:09,137 --> 01:23:11,973
- See if you can give them any help.
- Yes, sir.

1039
01:23:12,418 --> 01:23:15,796
Detail! Stand to horse!

1040
01:23:37,144 --> 01:23:40,064
Get the powder!

1041
01:23:46,547 --> 01:23:51,135
- Where's the mud?
- It's comin'. Here it is.

1042
01:24:32,599 --> 01:24:35,166
- ¿Qúe es?
- ¡Es un cañon!

1043
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:38,116
Clear out! I'll cover!

1044
01:24:38,259 --> 01:24:41,346
You heard the man.

1045
01:24:45,942 --> 01:24:48,572
- Come on, kid! Get outta here!
- I can shoot.

1046
01:24:51,265 --> 01:24:53,727
- Golly! What a gun!
- Go on! Grab a horse!

1047
01:25:03,787 --> 01:25:05,581
Cannon party!

1048
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:08,903
No one will fire until
you can identify your target!

1049
01:25:08,948 --> 01:25:10,262
Yes, sir!

1050
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:19,233
Let's give 'em a hand, boys! Knock on it!

1051
01:25:33,975 --> 01:25:35,751
Pick 'em up! Pick 'em up!

1052
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:38,469
Everybody rides double!
Come on! Pick 'em up!

1053
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:05,143
- Hold the gate! Hold the gate!
- Somebody's still outside!

1054
01:26:13,203 --> 01:26:15,039
Close the gate!

1055
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:17,918
Good work, Smitty!

1056
01:26:18,004 --> 01:26:20,840
We never missed you.
Good thing the kid did.

1057
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:22,720
That horse folded with me.

1058
01:26:22,806 --> 01:26:24,641
- You all right, Jim?
- Sure.

1059
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:27,563
- Oh, Mr Smith! You've been hurt!
- Oh, it's all right.

1060
01:26:27,607 --> 01:26:30,444
- Let's take a look at that.
- Doctor!

1061
01:26:30,488 --> 01:26:32,324
Mm. No bones broken.

1062
01:26:32,409 --> 01:26:35,246
All you need is a little
Doctor Beekeeper's fix-all.

1063
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:37,835
See? I...

1064
01:26:39,129 --> 01:26:40,965
Pretty close.

1065
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:45,819
- Bowie?
- Oh, he's all right. Turned a horse over.

1066
01:26:45,824 --> 01:26:47,587
- Jethro?
- Yes, sir.

1067
01:26:48,172 --> 01:26:51,468
Tell Colonel Bowie
I wish to speak to him at once.

1068
01:26:51,474 --> 01:26:52,649
Yes, sir.

1069
01:26:53,495 --> 01:26:56,331
Over here, where we can
have a little privacy.

1070
01:26:56,376 --> 01:26:58,920
Yes, sir.

1071
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,448
- Post this area.
- Yes, sir!

1072
01:27:21,642 --> 01:27:24,779
Will, considering the way
things turned out, I...

1073
01:27:24,783 --> 01:27:27,161
Dick, leave this to me.

1074
01:27:49,249 --> 01:27:52,085
Colonel Bowie.

1075
01:27:52,129 --> 01:27:56,822
I have had just about
enough insubordination.

1076
01:27:56,831 --> 01:27:58,666
You have?

1077
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:01,587
All right. Let's get to it. When and where?

1078
01:28:01,632 --> 01:28:04,468
I hear you're a good shot,
so let's choose pistols.

1079
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:07,649
I assumed you would choose
the ruffian's knife.

1080
01:28:07,694 --> 01:28:09,529
- Gentlemen, I beg...
- Dick, act for me!

1081
01:28:10,215 --> 01:28:11,230
Time?

1082
01:28:11,236 --> 01:28:15,198
I suggest after this war is over.

1083
01:28:15,995 --> 01:28:17,830
Yes.

1084
01:28:17,915 --> 01:28:20,681
The minute...
the very minute this war is over.

1085
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:23,532
- Jim?
- That's fine with me.

1086
01:28:23,977 --> 01:28:26,554
One last word, Bowie.

1087
01:28:26,558 --> 01:28:28,394
This evening's episode...

1088
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:32,317
By going on a mission without orders
you endangered this command.

1089
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,157
If it had not been for
the intervention of Captain Dickinson...

1090
01:28:35,201 --> 01:28:39,039
...a large number of volunteers
would now be dead out there...

1091
01:28:39,043 --> 01:28:40,879
...instead of at their posts in here.

1092
01:28:40,962 --> 01:28:44,800
I demand your word of honour that
there will no repetition of such conduct.

1093
01:28:44,803 --> 01:28:49,642
Or else I shall be forced
to order your arrest.

1094
01:28:52,446 --> 01:28:54,990
Travis...

1095
01:28:55,327 --> 01:29:00,749
Don't you worry any more
about arrest or insubordination.

1096
01:29:01,089 --> 01:29:04,051
I take my people out at daybreak.

1097
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:12,837
Colonel Travis...

1098
01:29:13,072 --> 01:29:14,907
I'm an old man...

1099
01:29:15,292 --> 01:29:17,795
...but you're wrong.

1100
01:29:22,114 --> 01:29:24,950
That Jethro...

1101
01:29:24,995 --> 01:29:26,830
Reminds me of a story...

1102
01:29:26,915 --> 01:29:28,750
Please, Crockett!

1103
01:29:28,935 --> 01:29:31,729
No homespun wisdom.
No cracker-barrel philosophy.

1104
01:29:31,776 --> 01:29:37,573
None of the backwoods wit
for which you are famous. Good night!

1105
01:29:37,608 --> 01:29:40,372
You'd better slack off on me, mister.

1106
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:44,254
This code of honour business
doesn't bother me a bit.

1107
01:29:44,258 --> 01:29:47,094
When there's trouble
I come from any direction...

1108
01:29:47,139 --> 01:29:48,974
...as sudden and surprising as I can.

1109
01:29:49,059 --> 01:29:52,896
My only concern here is 23 Tennesseans.

1110
01:29:52,899 --> 01:29:57,665
So you'd better let me know
what's in your mind.

1111
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:02,872
I'd have thought that would
have been obvious to you.

1112
01:30:04,423 --> 01:30:07,259
It's as simple as this.

1113
01:30:07,304 --> 01:30:10,140
There's Santa Anna with 7,000 men.

1114
01:30:10,185 --> 01:30:12,919
Up here is the Sabine River.

1115
01:30:12,925 --> 01:30:14,760
Somewhere around here...

1116
01:30:14,846 --> 01:30:17,682
...Sam Houston is trying
to organise an army.

1117
01:30:17,726 --> 01:30:21,563
And right in between... is the Alamo.

1118
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:26,506
Santa Anna can't go around and leave
a fort along his lines of communication.

1119
01:30:26,541 --> 01:30:28,304
He must reduce the Alamo by storm.

1120
01:30:28,388 --> 01:30:31,726
Every minute of time
we buy for Sam Houston...

1121
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:34,567
...is another precious minute
in the life of Texas.

1122
01:30:34,611 --> 01:30:38,449
And Crockett, nobody is ever going to say
that William Barrett Travis...

1123
01:30:38,452 --> 01:30:41,500
...did not buy every minute possible.

1124
01:30:42,392 --> 01:30:45,229
Makes sense.
Why didn't you tell Bowie that?

1125
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:48,710
Because a commander does not
have to explain his every decision.

1126
01:30:48,754 --> 01:30:51,591
You explained to me.

1127
01:30:51,635 --> 01:30:53,429
I have great respect for you, Crockett.

1128
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:58,282
But I have none for that
knife-fighting adventurer.

1129
01:30:58,317 --> 01:31:02,154
I figured any fella that shouldered
a gun was deserving of respect.

1130
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:05,995
But then I'm not... a real soldier.

1131
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,836
I never fought anybody but Injuns.

1132
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,716
Less'n you count the British.

1133
01:31:11,761 --> 01:31:14,305
Crockett.

1134
01:31:15,862 --> 01:31:19,699
I must ask you to forgive
my rudeness earlier on to you.

1135
01:31:20,203 --> 01:31:24,165
I'm an easy forgiver... at times.

1136
01:31:24,405 --> 01:31:27,533
Good night, Travis.

1137
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:48,117
Crack out a couple of jugs
and bring that guitar.

1138
01:31:48,271 --> 01:31:50,106
What are we gonna do, Davy?

1139
01:31:50,592 --> 01:31:52,136
Serenade.

1140
01:32:05,294 --> 01:32:06,128
Well...

1141
01:32:06,355 --> 01:32:10,192
I hope you told that long-winded idiot
what you think of him.

1142
01:32:10,396 --> 01:32:13,925
- I'm not rightly sure what I think of him.
- What's all this?

1143
01:32:15,918 --> 01:32:20,686
Well, I figured we'd crack a jug
and tell each other our troubles.

1144
01:32:20,691 --> 01:32:21,923
Now wait a minute, Crockett.

1145
01:32:21,939 --> 01:32:25,225
Don't try your winnin' ways on me.
My mind's made up.

1146
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:28,257
Well, we can have a farewell drink.

1147
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:30,137
You mean you're stayin'?

1148
01:32:30,221 --> 01:32:33,058
That's what I figure, Jim.

1149
01:32:33,101 --> 01:32:35,938
All right. We'll have a drink or two or ten.

1150
01:32:35,982 --> 01:32:38,819
But you ain't gonna get me drunk
and change my mind.

1151
01:32:38,863 --> 01:32:41,700
Of course not!

1152
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:50,002
Water patrol! Let's go!

1153
01:32:50,086 --> 01:32:52,881
Rise and shine! Up and at 'em!

1154
01:32:53,228 --> 01:32:55,063
Beekeeper, come on! Show a leg!

1155
01:32:55,148 --> 01:32:56,983
Get out of there!

1156
01:32:57,069 --> 01:32:59,905
Thimblerig, come on! It's your duty.

1157
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:02,786
- It's your duty!
- You don't have to wake us all!

1158
01:33:02,831 --> 01:33:07,961
- I'll get 'em up, Sergeant.
- Thanks, Parson. Thanks.

1159
01:33:08,491 --> 01:33:10,326
Hey!

1160
01:33:10,512 --> 01:33:13,749
Two dollars American
if you take out my patrol.

1161
01:33:13,753 --> 01:33:17,590
Two dollars? This morning
I wouldn't take your patrol for ten.

1162
01:33:18,194 --> 01:33:20,531
- I would!
- Got yourself a deal, Scotty.

1163
01:33:25,877 --> 01:33:30,086
Well, Davy, it looks like you done it again.

1164
01:33:31,239 --> 01:33:32,616
It do.

1165
01:33:34,278 --> 01:33:38,491
- And Bowie?
- Looked like a tie to me.

1166
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,706
Your duty!

1167
01:34:13,808 --> 01:34:16,644
Good morning, Colonel.
He's still sleepin'.

1168
01:34:16,689 --> 01:34:19,568
I'll take care of that, Jethro.

1169
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:24,285
Aaagh!

1170
01:34:24,371 --> 01:34:26,624
Hey!

1171
01:34:29,172 --> 01:34:31,008
Ow!

1172
01:34:31,093 --> 01:34:33,638
Crockett!

1173
01:34:33,974 --> 01:34:36,519
Crockett!

1174
01:34:39,736 --> 01:34:43,574
- Crockett, what the devil...
- Good morning, Smitty. Doc.

1175
01:34:43,576 --> 01:34:45,412
- Davy.
- Good morning.

1176
01:34:45,496 --> 01:34:46,790
Well!

1177
01:34:48,177 --> 01:34:51,014
You got yourself famous.
Now when they talk about Jim Bowie...

1178
01:34:51,058 --> 01:34:54,854
...they'll tell about the man that
pulled him out from under the troops.

1179
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,895
Gee! Will they?

1180
01:34:56,981 --> 01:35:00,718
Jim, the kid wants to know
about that sand bar episode.

1181
01:35:00,722 --> 01:35:02,697
- Oh, come on, Crockett!
- That's the truth.

1182
01:35:02,742 --> 01:35:06,579
- He's never heard anything but hearsay.
- Gosh, yes, Mr Bowie!

1183
01:35:06,584 --> 01:35:11,242
- All the fellas back home talk about...
- By the way, Smitty...

1184
01:35:11,257 --> 01:35:14,312
Say goodbye to Jim.

1185
01:35:15,225 --> 01:35:19,604
Are you going someplace, Colonel... Jim?

1186
01:35:19,826 --> 01:35:21,995
No.

1187
01:35:22,907 --> 01:35:26,744
No, I'm not goin' noplace.
That's just Crockett's idea of a joke.

1188
01:35:26,749 --> 01:35:28,584
Now you get well, Smitty, boy.

1189
01:35:28,669 --> 01:35:31,172
And thanks for your help.

1190
01:35:43,033 --> 01:35:46,870
- What are you doin'?
- It was rumoured we were leavin'.

1191
01:35:46,873 --> 01:35:50,295
I'll tell you when we're leaving.
Get that gear put away.

1192
01:35:52,635 --> 01:35:54,179
Crockett.

1193
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:22,058
By God, boy! You're bad-tempered!

1194
01:36:22,063 --> 01:36:24,899
Don't you ever try to make
a fool out of me again!

1195
01:36:24,943 --> 01:36:26,779
- Once is enough.
- I make up my own mind.

1196
01:36:27,163 --> 01:36:30,000
Never thought otherwise, Jim.

1197
01:36:30,044 --> 01:36:34,883
I was wondering... You think there'd be
a mouthful of that corn juice left?

1198
01:36:34,918 --> 01:36:37,683
We could kinda
cut the tar out of our throats.

1199
01:36:37,727 --> 01:36:40,564
That's a great idea, Davy!

1200
01:36:40,608 --> 01:36:42,820
That's a great idea!

1201
01:36:45,009 --> 01:36:48,930
I still say you're bad-tempered.

1202
01:36:54,011 --> 01:36:56,430
¡Amigo!

1203
01:36:56,492 --> 01:36:59,328
Halt! Who goes there?

1204
01:36:59,773 --> 01:37:02,609
Don't shoot, amigo!

1205
01:37:02,654 --> 01:37:06,074
A message for Jim Bowie.

1206
01:37:06,493 --> 01:37:09,454
In the sombrero!

1207
01:37:16,095 --> 01:37:16,929
Jim!

1208
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:21,977
Fella says there's a message
in this hat for you.

1209
01:37:23,777 --> 01:37:27,614
Huh! Kind of a strange way
to be sending messages, ain't it?

1210
01:37:27,618 --> 01:37:28,912
Yeah.

1211
01:37:29,899 --> 01:37:32,652
Maybe Santa Anna surrendered.

1212
01:38:17,271 --> 01:38:20,233
What is it, Jim?

1213
01:38:22,273 --> 01:38:24,449
I never... knew the night...

1214
01:38:24,453 --> 01:38:26,665
...could be so dark.

1215
01:38:30,914 --> 01:38:33,876
My... my wife...

1216
01:38:35,716 --> 01:38:38,094
She...

1217
01:38:38,396 --> 01:38:41,233
She's... dead.

1218
01:38:49,159 --> 01:38:52,579
I lived through it, Jim.

1219
01:38:53,921 --> 01:38:56,507
It's hard.

1220
01:38:56,602 --> 01:38:59,438
It was the plague.

1221
01:38:59,482 --> 01:39:01,663
The damn plague!

1222
01:39:01,684 --> 01:39:04,870
Oh, God, dear God!

1223
01:39:15,407 --> 01:39:17,242
Oh, Davy... she...

1224
01:39:17,727 --> 01:39:20,563
She was so small.

1225
01:39:20,608 --> 01:39:23,944
So tiny. So pretty tiny.

1226
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:29,247
She wanted to stay in Bexar
to be near me, but...

1227
01:39:29,251 --> 01:39:33,046
...I made her go to Coahuila.

1228
01:39:33,251 --> 01:39:36,087
I made her go!

1229
01:39:37,352 --> 01:39:40,313
My man Parson...

1230
01:39:41,193 --> 01:39:44,029
He's a kind of a preacher.

1231
01:39:44,974 --> 01:39:47,060
He keeps sayin'...

1232
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:51,669
...little do we mortals know.

1233
01:39:57,819 --> 01:40:01,197
Hold your head up, Jim.

1234
01:40:03,979 --> 01:40:05,814
Colonel Bowie...

1235
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:08,735
You've had a communication
from outside these walls.

1236
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:10,615
This is against my orders.

1237
01:40:10,701 --> 01:40:12,828
What information have you received?

1238
01:40:14,962 --> 01:40:17,591
Bowie, hand me that letter!

1239
01:40:22,184 --> 01:40:25,396
You may die tonight.

1240
01:40:25,826 --> 01:40:27,663
That little lady, Jim.

1241
01:40:28,206 --> 01:40:31,293
She won't like it.

1242
01:41:06,574 --> 01:41:08,409
Colonel Bowie...

1243
01:41:09,095 --> 01:41:13,439
Please accept
my most profound sympathy...

1244
01:41:13,496 --> 01:41:18,042
...and my regret for having
disturbed you at such a moment.

1245
01:41:18,597 --> 01:41:25,645
This in no way impairs your right to call
me on the field of honour at a later date.

1246
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:35,438
But I wish to express my sorrow for you...

1247
01:41:35,443 --> 01:41:41,532
...and present my apology for
being such a boor at such a time.

1248
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:44,298
Travis...

1249
01:41:44,684 --> 01:41:48,313
You can't help bein' you...

1250
01:41:48,985 --> 01:41:52,031
...and I can't help bein' me.

1251
01:42:17,292 --> 01:42:21,740
- What's that all about, Sergeant?
- 32 cases hospitalised today, sir.

1252
01:42:21,765 --> 01:42:25,432
Well... Tell 'em to move over
after last night's party...

1253
01:42:25,535 --> 01:42:29,373
Oh, no, sir. Women and children.

1254
01:42:29,675 --> 01:42:32,054
Another officers' call.

1255
01:42:33,517 --> 01:42:35,323
See for yourself. It's all like that.

1256
01:42:35,437 --> 01:42:36,690
Sir.

1257
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:40,204
Gentlemen.

1258
01:42:40,499 --> 01:42:43,336
- Doctor.
- It's as simple as this, gentlemen.

1259
01:42:43,379 --> 01:42:46,216
I had 32 cases of
mild dysentery this morning.

1260
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:50,098
I tested the salt pork barrel the rations
were issued from. It's tainted.

1261
01:42:50,101 --> 01:42:52,856
So is every other barrel in the warehouse.

1262
01:42:53,342 --> 01:42:54,176
Sergeant.

1263
01:42:54,302 --> 01:42:56,137
Barring the pork, I figure we have...

1264
01:42:56,223 --> 01:42:59,895
...three or four days' full rations
to serve to the garrison.

1265
01:43:02,245 --> 01:43:04,080
You see the dilemma, gentlemen.

1266
01:43:04,966 --> 01:43:06,801
We are almost out of food.

1267
01:43:06,887 --> 01:43:11,145
However, Santa Anna does not
suffer under the same handicap.

1268
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,923
Therefore our course is obvious.

1269
01:43:13,809 --> 01:43:16,020
If you'll follow me.

1270
01:43:17,548 --> 01:43:21,635
¡Vuelve, el gitano, vuelve...

1271
01:43:30,493 --> 01:43:31,787
¡Olé!

1272
01:43:57,079 --> 01:43:59,916
I can think of more comfortable places
to watch that show from.

1273
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,297
Quiet!

1274
01:44:23,986 --> 01:44:25,722
Dick.

1275
01:44:25,907 --> 01:44:28,452
Yes, sir?

1276
01:44:30,147 --> 01:44:32,984
It's a half-hour to daybreak.

1277
01:44:33,028 --> 01:44:34,864
Have your men stand to horse.

1278
01:44:34,949 --> 01:44:37,494
Yes, sir.

1279
01:46:20,855 --> 01:46:22,560
The night herders.

1280
01:46:22,676 --> 01:46:24,053
Two to each one of 'em.

1281
01:46:24,057 --> 01:46:26,894
Don't miss.
There'll be a lot of hungry kids.

1282
01:46:27,438 --> 01:46:28,944
Take 'em.

1283
01:46:29,357 --> 01:46:31,776
Smitty.

1284
01:46:34,298 --> 01:46:36,965
Grab a horse off that picket line for Smitty.

1285
01:46:36,979 --> 01:46:38,815
Get a good one.

1286
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:40,735
Colonel Davy?

1287
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:43,857
Can I ask you fellas
something face to face?

1288
01:46:43,901 --> 01:46:45,737
Sure thing, kid.

1289
01:46:45,922 --> 01:46:49,581
Are you really sending me because
I'm a good horseman like you said?

1290
01:46:49,596 --> 01:46:51,317
Of course, as I live and breathe!

1291
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:54,241
You're smarter than Beekeeper
and you swim better than the gambler.

1292
01:46:54,786 --> 01:46:58,483
It ain't that you don't think I'd be
worth my salt when the fighting starts?

1293
01:46:58,526 --> 01:47:00,361
Smitty, let me tell you something.

1294
01:47:00,546 --> 01:47:05,384
Of all the men in this outfit, I'd pick
you to side me if the goin' was rough.

1295
01:47:05,519 --> 01:47:08,013
- You see?
- Gee!

1296
01:47:08,228 --> 01:47:10,314
Get on this horse.

1297
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:17,326
There's nothing out there,
kid, but dark.

1298
01:47:17,571 --> 01:47:19,657
Good luck, Smitty.

1299
01:47:23,192 --> 01:47:26,028
It'll take him quite a few days
to get to Houston.

1300
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:29,409
So I figured.

1301
01:47:42,757 --> 01:47:44,592
The south side's all taken care of.

1302
01:47:44,677 --> 01:47:47,388
Get a horse.

1303
01:47:49,018 --> 01:47:52,353
Now all we can do is wait.

1304
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:54,295
That's the hardest part.

1305
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:56,049
It sure is.

1306
01:47:58,682 --> 01:48:00,393
Column halt!

1307
01:48:02,823 --> 01:48:04,658
Carry on, Dick.

1308
01:48:04,744 --> 01:48:06,579
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Will.

1309
01:48:06,963 --> 01:48:08,799
Best of luck, Dickinson.

1310
01:48:09,643 --> 01:48:12,563
Forward, yo-ho!

1311
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:34,352
If they don't shoot pretty quick,
we've got to go anyway.

1312
01:48:47,054 --> 01:48:48,974
Let's take 'em!

1313
01:50:07,936 --> 01:50:09,856
Hold your fire!

1314
01:50:11,036 --> 01:50:11,870
Hold your fire!

1315
01:50:12,396 --> 01:50:14,231
Pick your targets!

1316
01:50:14,816 --> 01:50:16,131
Fire!

1317
01:50:16,137 --> 01:50:17,532
Fire at will!

1318
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,037
Second rank, fire!

1319
01:50:30,381 --> 01:50:33,635
Fall back! Fall back!

1320
01:50:37,002 --> 01:50:38,588
Fall back!

1321
01:51:00,369 --> 01:51:01,203
Fire!

1322
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:03,245
Fall back!

1323
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:05,185
Second rank!

1324
01:51:05,271 --> 01:51:07,106
Fire!

1325
01:51:07,191 --> 01:51:09,777
Fall back!

1326
01:51:11,593 --> 01:51:13,428
Third rank!

1327
01:51:13,514 --> 01:51:14,348
Ready?

1328
01:51:15,074 --> 01:51:17,368
Fire!

1329
01:51:25,136 --> 01:51:27,805
Cease fire!

1330
01:51:37,719 --> 01:51:39,304
Close the gate!

1331
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:41,806
There's one thing for sure.

1332
01:51:41,821 --> 01:51:43,636
He's a bearcat for nerve.

1333
01:51:43,641 --> 01:51:45,476
I'm grateful for that.

1334
01:51:45,562 --> 01:51:49,239
I'd hate to look at a coward
over a duellin' pistol.

1335
01:51:49,302 --> 01:51:54,140
You're not much for this forgive
and forget business, are you, Jim?

1336
01:51:54,175 --> 01:51:55,272
No.

1337
01:52:14,126 --> 01:52:15,931
Beef for supper.

1338
01:52:15,947 --> 01:52:17,492
Yes, sir.

1339
01:52:22,468 --> 01:52:25,225
Hog never rightly could pass for meat.

1340
01:52:25,549 --> 01:52:28,094
But beef!

1341
01:52:36,713 --> 01:52:39,550
The big he-bull himself!

1342
01:52:39,593 --> 01:52:41,429
Let's go!

1343
01:52:41,813 --> 01:52:43,649
Ladies to cover!

1344
01:52:43,734 --> 01:52:46,821
Men to your posts!

1345
01:53:15,944 --> 01:53:17,779
- Captain Dickinson.
- Yes, sir.

1346
01:53:18,464 --> 01:53:21,791
Order all men fed in relays.
Full issue of ammunition.

1347
01:53:21,806 --> 01:53:23,350
Yes, sir.

1348
01:53:30,547 --> 01:53:33,341
That's the best-dressed army I ever saw.

1349
01:53:33,387 --> 01:53:36,223
Fancy clothes don't make a fightin' man.

1350
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:39,104
They're just off two years
puttin' down revolts.

1351
01:53:39,149 --> 01:53:40,632
They're fightin' men.

1352
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:21,916
Generalissimo Santa Anna has just
arrived with the main body of his army...

1353
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,755
...and has only now become aware...

1354
01:54:23,841 --> 01:54:26,678
...that there are women
and children in the mission.

1355
01:54:26,722 --> 01:54:29,559
He wishes that the ladies
receive his apologies...

1356
01:54:29,603 --> 01:54:32,440
...and be informed he has
never attacked a position...

1357
01:54:32,483 --> 01:54:35,320
...without the enemy
being given the opportunity...

1358
01:54:35,364 --> 01:54:37,931
...to evacuate women and children.

1359
01:54:37,945 --> 01:54:41,783
According, you have one hour in which
to evacuate these noncombatants...

1360
01:54:41,785 --> 01:54:44,622
...who will be provided with transport...

1361
01:54:44,666 --> 01:54:47,953
...to proceed to such destination
as is their choice.

1362
01:54:48,147 --> 01:54:51,943
Signed: Antonio López
de Santa Anna, ruler of Mexico.

1363
01:54:51,949 --> 01:54:54,660
Your answer?

1364
01:54:58,271 --> 01:55:01,107
My compliments to the general
for his gallantry.

1365
01:55:01,152 --> 01:55:04,239
We will evacuate our noncombatants.

1366
01:55:16,615 --> 01:55:19,451
Single men will remain at their posts!

1367
01:55:19,596 --> 01:55:22,831
Married men will arrange
transport for their families!

1368
01:55:53,923 --> 01:55:57,760
- Sue, you'd better hurry.
- She won't go.

1369
01:55:57,764 --> 01:56:01,601
Save your breath, Will.
Your ever so persuasive breath.

1370
01:56:01,605 --> 01:56:03,440
All right, say it.

1371
01:56:03,526 --> 01:56:06,362
It's a sorry man
that can't make his wife obey.

1372
01:56:06,407 --> 01:56:09,243
You seem to forget, Dick,
that I too am married.

1373
01:56:09,287 --> 01:56:12,081
I've got to do
what I think is the right thing.

1374
01:56:12,128 --> 01:56:15,965
I'm a soldier's wife.
My child is a soldier's child.

1375
01:56:15,969 --> 01:56:17,804
We'll stay.

1376
01:56:17,989 --> 01:56:19,804
Very well, Sue.

1377
01:56:19,809 --> 01:56:21,644
Dick.

1378
01:56:21,730 --> 01:56:24,567
Don't be angry with me.

1379
01:56:24,611 --> 01:56:26,447
I'm not angry.

1380
01:56:26,531 --> 01:56:28,727
I'm proud.

1381
01:56:31,633 --> 01:56:34,721
- Dick, take your patrol.
- Yes, sir.

1382
01:56:37,855 --> 01:56:40,692
Married men, return to your posts!

1383
01:56:41,335 --> 01:56:43,171
Open the gate!

1384
01:56:43,355 --> 01:56:45,191
Captain Dickinson!

1385
01:56:45,276 --> 01:56:47,112
Escort! Forward!

1386
01:56:47,196 --> 01:56:49,574
Yo-ho!

1387
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:01,198
Ma'am, I ain't got no woman to say
goodbye to. Could I tell you goodbye?

1388
01:57:01,533 --> 01:57:03,881
Surely.

1389
01:57:04,143 --> 01:57:07,104
Get up, boy! Ya!

1390
01:57:10,464 --> 01:57:12,299
Jocko, Nell.

1391
01:57:12,685 --> 01:57:14,271
It's time.

1392
01:57:33,469 --> 01:57:37,515
Go on, Jocko. Do the best you can.

1393
01:57:50,594 --> 01:57:53,055
I can't.

1394
01:57:57,315 --> 01:57:59,776
I can't.

1395
01:58:03,437 --> 01:58:05,272
I just can't do it, fellas.

1396
01:58:05,458 --> 01:58:08,294
Colonel Bowie.

1397
01:58:08,339 --> 01:58:10,174
This is a request and not an order.

1398
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:13,054
But I suggest that,
as desperate as our needs are...

1399
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:17,866
...that family's needs are more desperate.

1400
01:58:17,901 --> 01:58:22,739
Get in that line, Jocko,
and move out with your people.

1401
01:58:22,774 --> 01:58:24,538
You can see how it is.

1402
01:58:24,622 --> 01:58:26,458
It's more than a man can bear.

1403
01:58:26,543 --> 01:58:31,813
She's never said a word of pity for herself
in the ten years she's been blind.

1404
01:58:31,948 --> 01:58:34,141
Will Travis!
Just who do you think you are?

1405
01:58:34,715 --> 01:58:41,066
Mrs Robertson, I can assure you that no
blame will attach itself to your husband.

1406
01:58:41,101 --> 01:58:44,786
Get movin', Jocko, or I'll help you
along with the toe of my boot.

1407
01:58:44,788 --> 01:58:47,625
Shut up, Jim Bowie!
And you and Travis listen close.

1408
01:58:47,669 --> 01:58:52,468
My man ain't goin' out. He's just as much
a man as either one of you. Maybe more.

1409
01:58:52,503 --> 01:58:57,268
In spite of he ain't rich like you, Jim,
or fancy educated like you, Will Travis.

1410
01:58:57,303 --> 01:58:59,067
Now, Jocko, you get back up on that wall.

1411
01:58:59,152 --> 01:59:02,989
Cos you're just as good as
any man that ever trod leather.

1412
01:59:02,994 --> 01:59:04,829
And it's your right.

1413
01:59:04,914 --> 01:59:09,752
And I can't see, but I'm just as good
as any woman in Texas.

1414
01:59:09,787 --> 01:59:12,551
And it's my right to go and leave you.

1415
01:59:12,596 --> 01:59:17,434
Now we've cuddled nice and said
all our goodbyes, but I'll say it again.

1416
01:59:17,469 --> 01:59:19,233
We'd be fools not to face it.

1417
01:59:19,318 --> 01:59:22,154
You're likely to go and get
yourself killed in this battle.

1418
01:59:22,198 --> 01:59:26,035
I don't know what you're going
to say at the gates of heaven...

1419
01:59:26,039 --> 01:59:30,877
...but I'm gonna say no woman ever lived
had herself a better husband than you.

1420
01:59:30,912 --> 01:59:33,427
Now go on!

1421
01:59:44,703 --> 01:59:47,539
- Hip! Hip!
- Hooray!

1422
01:59:47,884 --> 01:59:49,719
- Hip! Hip!
- Hooray!

1423
01:59:49,904 --> 01:59:53,032
- Hip! Hip!
- Hooray!

1424
02:00:34,895 --> 02:00:37,732
Captain Dickinson!

1425
02:00:37,876 --> 02:00:39,662
Yes, sir.

1426
02:00:39,697 --> 02:00:41,533
Have the Doctor set up
the hospital in the chapel.

1427
02:00:41,617 --> 02:00:46,622
- You will take charge of Battery No. 4.
- Yes, sir.

1428
02:01:25,490 --> 02:01:29,535
¡Clarines! ¡Suenen al ataque!

1429
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:33,736
¡Adelante!

1430
02:01:53,397 --> 02:01:56,233
Hold your fire.

1431
02:01:56,278 --> 02:01:59,198
Hold your fire.

1432
02:02:02,299 --> 02:02:04,843
Take 'em!

1433
02:02:28,685 --> 02:02:30,261
Straight frontal attack!

1434
02:02:30,306 --> 02:02:35,146
We need more men up here!
I'll get some strength from Dickinson.

1435
02:02:52,852 --> 02:02:56,272
North wall! Hurry it up!

1436
02:02:59,574 --> 02:03:03,327
- Who is it?
- It's the Parson.

1437
02:03:31,683 --> 02:03:35,729
¡Clarines! ¡Suenen al retiro!

1438
02:03:46,846 --> 02:03:48,681
Hold your fire!

1439
02:03:48,767 --> 02:03:52,729
Hold your fire! They're retiring!

1440
02:04:11,453 --> 02:04:13,246
See did any of our boys get hurt.

1441
02:04:13,332 --> 02:04:19,171
I'll be below gettin' washed on
the outside and wet down inside.

1442
02:04:19,206 --> 02:04:21,473
We've been lucky today.

1443
02:04:23,955 --> 02:04:25,791
Check the damage.

1444
02:04:25,876 --> 02:04:29,672
Officers' call in ten minutes.

1445
02:04:30,517 --> 02:04:32,520
Bring on another.

1446
02:05:10,409 --> 02:05:14,246
Sure killed many a brave man today.

1447
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:18,087
It's funny. I was proud of 'em.

1448
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:22,757
Even while I was killin' 'em
I was proud of 'em.

1449
02:05:22,792 --> 02:05:25,628
It speaks well for men that
so many ain't afraid to die...

1450
02:05:25,673 --> 02:05:29,510
...because they think right's on their side.

1451
02:05:29,514 --> 02:05:31,225
It speaks well.

1452
02:05:39,576 --> 02:05:42,242
- Post this area, Lightfoot.
- It's already done.

1453
02:05:42,257 --> 02:05:44,092
All right, Sergeant.

1454
02:05:44,177 --> 02:05:46,382
- Report!
- 50 casualties.

1455
02:05:46,498 --> 02:05:49,264
28 dead, 22 wounded.

1456
02:05:49,278 --> 02:05:51,114
Morale... high.

1457
02:05:51,459 --> 02:05:55,296
Well, morale ain't gonna help us much
if Fannin don't get here... and quick!

1458
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:57,135
- Ow, Doc!
- Quit squawking.

1459
02:05:57,321 --> 02:06:00,157
You oughta be laying on your back.
You'll never walk.

1460
02:06:00,702 --> 02:06:04,539
Santa Anna didn't have much respect
for us today, and he got burned.

1461
02:06:04,542 --> 02:06:08,379
Now he's gonna be comin' at us
with a battle plan from all four sides.

1462
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:12,300
We already been cut down by a third.
How long do you think we can hold out?

1463
02:06:12,615 --> 02:06:14,380
Santa Anna won't attack again today.

1464
02:06:14,865 --> 02:06:17,701
He'll clear the field of
all the dead and wounded.

1465
02:06:18,146 --> 02:06:20,982
Fannin will be here by tomorrow,
even without a forced march.

1466
02:06:21,027 --> 02:06:23,793
With his 500 men...

1467
02:06:23,807 --> 02:06:25,643
...we can hold this fort for a month.

1468
02:06:25,728 --> 02:06:27,915
500? I thought it was a thousand.

1469
02:06:28,008 --> 02:06:31,846
- 500.
- Bonham's approaching, sir.

1470
02:06:31,849 --> 02:06:36,020
Good. Fannin should be close behind.

1471
02:06:46,814 --> 02:06:47,649
Well?

1472
02:06:47,975 --> 02:06:50,732
Colonel Fannin isn't comin'.

1473
02:06:50,755 --> 02:06:53,550
His men were ambushed. Murdered!

1474
02:06:53,695 --> 02:06:57,115
There won't be any help.

1475
02:06:59,757 --> 02:07:02,511
Have all volunteers
assembled in the compound.

1476
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:10,015
Well, that's it.

1477
02:07:10,019 --> 02:07:12,855
I'm taking my men out.
Cut through to the North.

1478
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:15,769
You comin'?

1479
02:07:19,161 --> 02:07:21,550
It seems like the better part of valour.

1480
02:07:50,109 --> 02:07:51,486
Men...

1481
02:07:53,090 --> 02:07:55,125
Jim Bonham has brought
news as sad as death.

1482
02:07:56,011 --> 02:07:59,748
Colonel Fannin has been ambushed.

1483
02:07:59,751 --> 02:08:02,768
We can expect no help.

1484
02:08:02,792 --> 02:08:06,462
I stay here with my command.

1485
02:08:06,633 --> 02:08:11,429
But any of you who wish to
may leave with all honour.

1486
02:08:11,464 --> 02:08:16,149
Failing reinforcements,
the Alamo cannot hold.

1487
02:08:16,196 --> 02:08:20,033
But do not go with heads hung low.

1488
02:08:20,037 --> 02:08:23,875
No man can criticise your behaviour.

1489
02:08:23,878 --> 02:08:27,382
Here on these ramparts...

1490
02:08:27,719 --> 02:08:32,178
...you have bought a priceless
ten days of time for Houston.

1491
02:08:32,193 --> 02:08:34,956
You have bled the enemy army.

1492
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:39,138
You are brave and noble soldiers.

1493
02:08:39,141 --> 02:08:41,978
Open the gate!

1494
02:08:44,143 --> 02:08:47,230
May God bless you.

1495
02:10:40,813 --> 02:10:42,733
Close the gate!

1496
02:10:59,677 --> 02:11:01,142
Hold up there, bub.

1497
02:11:01,398 --> 02:11:04,234
You're in dangerous territory.
Where you headin'?

1498
02:11:04,279 --> 02:11:08,116
I'm lookin' for General Sam Houston.
Got a message for him.

1499
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:09,955
Well, you've come to the right place.

1500
02:11:10,041 --> 02:11:13,708
Corporal of the guard! Post No. 3!

1501
02:11:14,181 --> 02:11:16,957
- What is it?
- He wants to see General Sam.

1502
02:11:16,962 --> 02:11:19,756
Come on, bub!

1503
02:11:45,328 --> 02:11:49,165
- The lad has a message for the general.
- Yes, sir.

1504
02:11:49,470 --> 02:11:53,938
You'd better get down, and get yourself
some beans and a little sleep.

1505
02:11:53,943 --> 02:11:54,705
No, sir!

1506
02:11:54,831 --> 02:11:57,783
I've gotta get back to the Alamo.

1507
02:12:32,181 --> 02:12:34,548
Yesterday I read your
Colonel Fannin's message...

1508
02:12:34,561 --> 02:12:37,330
...telling us he cannot reach
the Alamo in time.

1509
02:12:39,135 --> 02:12:43,234
Today I have this... from the Alamo.

1510
02:12:44,825 --> 02:12:46,601
They are surrounded...

1511
02:12:47,236 --> 02:12:48,504
...and we can't help them.

1512
02:12:50,746 --> 02:12:52,280
Now, tomorrow...

1513
02:12:52,367 --> 02:12:57,830
...when your recruits
start to whine and bellyache...

1514
02:12:58,588 --> 02:13:05,803
...you tell them that 185 of their friends...

1515
02:13:06,771 --> 02:13:10,733
...neighbours, fellow Texicans...

1516
02:13:11,573 --> 02:13:16,411
...are holed up in a crumbling adobe
church down on the Rio Bravo...

1517
02:13:16,446 --> 02:13:20,419
...buying them this precious time.

1518
02:13:27,036 --> 02:13:30,039
I hope they remember.

1519
02:13:31,797 --> 02:13:35,175
I hope Texas remembers.

1520
02:13:48,482 --> 02:13:51,902
# A time to be sowing...

1521
02:13:53,283 --> 02:13:57,162
# The green leaves of summer...

1522
02:13:58,084 --> 02:14:01,504
# Are calling me home...

1523
02:14:01,925 --> 02:14:06,221
# It was good to be young then...

1524
02:14:06,727 --> 02:14:10,689
# In the season of plenty...

1525
02:14:11,487 --> 02:14:15,324
# When the catfish were jumping...

1526
02:14:16,329 --> 02:14:21,501
It may not be as comfortable,
but it's safer in here.

1527
02:14:21,991 --> 02:14:23,163
He's had a hard day.

1528
02:14:25,431 --> 02:14:27,267
Will...

1529
02:14:27,452 --> 02:14:29,288
I'm sorry.

1530
02:14:29,372 --> 02:14:31,917
What for?

1531
02:14:32,253 --> 02:14:35,090
I guess I've said some
pretty rude things to you.

1532
02:14:35,133 --> 02:14:38,929
Well, at least, I thought 'em.

1533
02:14:38,974 --> 02:14:40,810
You're a wonderful woman, Sue.

1534
02:14:40,893 --> 02:14:42,729
Forget it.

1535
02:14:43,414 --> 02:14:46,252
Dick, stay here as long as you can.

1536
02:14:46,655 --> 02:14:49,418
Probably won't need you till morning.

1537
02:14:51,717 --> 02:14:55,554
I've only added to your worries, haven't I?

1538
02:14:55,559 --> 02:14:59,354
I know I must be very selfish.

1539
02:15:00,358 --> 02:15:03,104
I couldn't think of facing
the world without you.

1540
02:15:03,139 --> 02:15:07,202
# A time to be reaping...

1541
02:15:07,941 --> 02:15:12,401
# A time to be sowing...

1542
02:15:12,742 --> 02:15:17,311
# The green leaves of summer...

1543
02:15:17,544 --> 02:15:22,064
# Are calling me home...

1544
02:15:22,346 --> 02:15:26,153
# It was good to be young then...

1545
02:15:26,186 --> 02:15:31,509
# To be close to the earth...

1546
02:15:32,867 --> 02:15:39,534
# Now the green leaves of summer...

1547
02:15:39,589 --> 02:15:41,425
# Are calling...

1548
02:15:42,170 --> 02:15:45,840
What are you thinkin', Davy?

1549
02:15:46,971 --> 02:15:49,807
I'm not thinkin'.

1550
02:15:49,852 --> 02:15:53,105
I'm just rememberin'.

1551
02:15:56,974 --> 02:16:00,711
Well, I sure done a heap of things
I shouldn't have done.

1552
02:16:00,714 --> 02:16:04,384
Seemed urgent at the moment.

1553
02:16:04,555 --> 02:16:07,772
Got myself a heap of sins to answer for.

1554
02:16:07,797 --> 02:16:10,453
Wish I hadn't did 'em.

1555
02:16:11,277 --> 02:16:15,973
I reckon old Saint Pete's gonna slam them
Pearly Gates right smack-dab in my face.

1556
02:16:16,008 --> 02:16:17,773
There ain't no Pearly Gates.

1557
02:16:17,959 --> 02:16:21,796
When you're dead, you're meat for
the worms. That's all there is to it.

1558
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:24,637
You don't believe in no afterlife?
No hereafter?

1559
02:16:24,681 --> 02:16:27,569
Tales for children! Bunkum and bosh!

1560
02:16:28,422 --> 02:16:31,092
I say this.

1561
02:16:31,103 --> 02:16:32,939
I believe.

1562
02:16:33,723 --> 02:16:38,762
I can never find a way to argue down
you that don't believe.

1563
02:16:38,784 --> 02:16:41,621
But I believe in the Lord God Almighty...

1564
02:16:41,665 --> 02:16:45,503
...all knowing and all forgiving.

1565
02:16:45,506 --> 02:16:50,345
And I believe that good
shall be triumphant in the end...

1566
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:53,103
...and that evil shall be vanquished.

1567
02:16:53,249 --> 02:16:56,085
I believe in a hereafter.

1568
02:16:56,330 --> 02:17:00,167
Me, too. I figure a man's
got to believe in those things...

1569
02:17:00,171 --> 02:17:03,708
...does he want to believe in
the good things about man.

1570
02:17:03,712 --> 02:17:06,648
About his very own self.
The real good things.

1571
02:17:06,792 --> 02:17:10,420
Like courage and honesty...

1572
02:17:11,693 --> 02:17:14,237
And love.

1573
02:17:16,195 --> 02:17:18,614
Jethro!

1574
02:17:20,036 --> 02:17:22,580
Yes, sir.

1575
02:17:31,199 --> 02:17:35,246
This is somethin' I promised Mrs Bowie.

1576
02:17:36,421 --> 02:17:38,256
- Know what it is?
- No, sir.

1577
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:41,176
That's your freedom.

1578
02:17:41,221 --> 02:17:44,641
You're a free man, Jeth.

1579
02:17:46,023 --> 02:17:47,858
Thank you, sir.

1580
02:17:47,943 --> 02:17:52,781
You'd better get your belongings together
and get on over the wall tonight.

1581
02:17:52,816 --> 02:17:57,791
It's gonna be more than
a little rough around here.

1582
02:18:02,347 --> 02:18:04,182
Good luck, Jeth.

1583
02:18:04,268 --> 02:18:07,104
Thank you, sir.

1584
02:18:07,149 --> 02:18:09,985
Uh... Colonel Bowie,
you say I'm a free man?

1585
02:18:10,029 --> 02:18:11,822
That's right.

1586
02:18:11,909 --> 02:18:14,745
Well, if I'm free...

1587
02:18:14,789 --> 02:18:18,626
...then I got a right
to decide what I'm gonna do.

1588
02:18:18,630 --> 02:18:23,299
Seems to me that's what
you men are fighting for.

1589
02:18:23,304 --> 02:18:26,569
So I... reckon I'll...

1590
02:18:27,273 --> 02:18:29,859
I'll stay.

1591
02:19:18,787 --> 02:19:20,081
Look!

1592
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,253
Gentlemen, good luck.

1593
02:21:27,842 --> 02:21:31,512
Get to your battle stations.

1594
02:22:23,154 --> 02:22:24,865
What's that?

1595
02:22:34,016 --> 02:22:36,936
It's sure loud.

1596
02:22:57,484 --> 02:22:59,319
¡A la carga!

1597
02:22:59,704 --> 02:23:03,082
- ¡Adelante!
- ¡Adelante!

1598
02:23:08,146 --> 02:23:10,565
¡Fuego!

1599
02:24:28,527 --> 02:24:31,194
Get Bowie out of here!
Get him into the chapel!

1600
02:24:31,208 --> 02:24:33,044
- I'm all right.
- Hold still, Colonel.

1601
02:24:33,129 --> 02:24:35,896
- I said I'm all right!
- Colonel Crockett says...

1602
02:24:35,909 --> 02:24:37,998
Don't start that again!

1603
02:25:52,750 --> 02:25:55,169
Aaaagh!

1604
02:26:10,233 --> 02:26:13,611
Battery No. 3! Come on!

1605
02:26:18,074 --> 02:26:20,078
Get to the infirmary!

1606
02:26:47,741 --> 02:26:48,905
Fire!

1607
02:28:02,001 --> 02:28:03,545
Crockett!

1608
02:28:04,482 --> 02:28:07,026
Crockett!

1609
02:28:09,984 --> 02:28:12,143
North Wall.

1610
02:28:13,385 --> 02:28:15,220
Half of you men!

1611
02:28:15,305 --> 02:28:18,141
Throw up a barricade here!
Throw up a barricade!

1612
02:28:18,186 --> 02:28:19,863
You stay on that wall!

1613
02:29:33,966 --> 02:29:35,801
Do this mean what I think it do?

1614
02:29:35,886 --> 02:29:38,263
It do.

1615
02:30:25,977 --> 02:30:28,271
Aagh!

1616
02:31:13,150 --> 02:31:14,444
Aagh!

1617
02:32:08,344 --> 02:32:13,224
# Tennessee babe
with the sweet-sounding name...

1618
02:32:14,066 --> 02:32:18,112
# Dear little rose of the South...

1619
02:32:18,867 --> 02:32:21,703
# You are so sweet that
the neighbours all claim...

1620
02:32:21,748 --> 02:32:25,669
- Muchísimas gracias.
- Pues nada.

1621
02:32:28,470 --> 02:32:31,724
Where's Daddy, Mommy?

1622
02:32:32,311 --> 02:32:36,107
- # Sweet Lisa
- # Sweet Lisa...

1623
02:32:37,113 --> 02:32:41,493
# Just look at the way you have grown...

1624
02:32:44,794 --> 02:32:48,340
- # Oh, Lisa
- # Oh, Lisa...

1625
02:32:48,635 --> 02:32:52,306
- # Dear Lisa
- # Dear Lisa...

1626
02:32:53,397 --> 02:32:56,733
# Oh, Lisa, my baby...

1627
02:32:58,198 --> 02:33:01,576
# My darling, my own...

1628
02:33:05,881 --> 02:33:10,594
# Tennessee babe,
save your dimples for me...

1629
02:33:10,683 --> 02:33:14,436
# Don't let a one get away...

1630
02:33:15,482 --> 02:33:18,318
# Oh, Lisa, my darling...

1631
02:33:18,363 --> 02:33:21,199
# Though you're only three...

1632
02:33:21,244 --> 02:33:25,706
# You'll be a grand lady some day...

1633
02:33:28,006 --> 02:33:29,550
¡Corneta!
