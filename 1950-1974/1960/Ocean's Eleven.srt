1
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,679
<i>Christmas in Beverly Hills.</i>
<i>A time when everyone...</i>

2
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,510
<i>... thinks only kind, tolerant,</i>
<i>generous thoughts.</i>

3
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,072
- I went looking for you.
- What? What is it, Mushy?

4
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,840
- I went to the house looking for you.
- Why? What happened?

5
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,429
Nothing. I thought
maybe you needed me.

6
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,110
Heart attacks, that's what I need
all of you for.

7
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,159
Phoenix, Arizona calling, Mr. Acebos.

8
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,119
Hello?
Yes, operator, speaking.

9
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,078
Mr. Ocean doesn't answer?

10
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,078
Still doesn't answer. And Mr. Foster?

11
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,918
Of course, keep calling.
They gotta come in sometime.

12
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,317
Hello? Jimmy, are you in yet?

13
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,591
You don't even expect me.

14
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,512
Sorry, operator, Mr. Foster is out.

15
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,352
Yeah, so is Mr. Ocean.

16
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,032
I made it a rule not to answer
the phone during December.

17
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,912
That's crazy. Why?

18
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,910
Because one December when
I picked up the phone they...

19
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,918
...sent me out in the snow
to play with my friends.

20
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,711
That was at the Bulge.

21
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,591
Clowns they gotta be.

22
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,190
I like clowns
but they should be funny.

23
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,551
It's a clown's business being funny.

24
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,988
And I ask you...

25
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,150
...what's funny about going
to the pokey for 10 years?

26
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,678
- To me, nothing.
- Yet that's where we'll be...

27
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,556
...unless every bit of timing
is checked and re-checked.

28
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,073
One more question.
Inform me frankly...

29
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,637
...what have I done to earn contempt?

30
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,432
Why should I be treated
like I'm stupid?

31
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,240
Right, it was your scheme first.

32
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,231
So was the racetrack...

33
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,429
...the supermarket and
the switch on Nelson's cars.

34
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,471
All my inspirations.

35
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,953
There isn't a man with my reputation.

36
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,869
So, why don't those
fellows respect me?

37
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,918
Maybe because you just get ideas.

38
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,156
I just get ideas.

39
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,749
Be careful, she'll rub you out.

40
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,837
Acebos, he's insistent.

41
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,269
You dialed the right number.

42
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,630
Now please hang up
and don't do it again.

43
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,553
- Where were we?
- Right here.

44
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,233
That man is gonna flip.

45
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,434
He got us into the deal.
Let him sweat.

46
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,312
He didn't silver-tongue you long,
30 seconds give or take.

47
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,633
You don't expect me to turn down
a business opportunity.

48
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,711
- Especially with no risk.
- I wouldn't have it another way.

49
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,311
- It's time we looked up Vince Massler.
- He doesn't want in.

50
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,995
- Why not?
- Beats the hell out of me, sergeant.

51
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,995
I took him and dragged him
from Solano to Siegfried line.

52
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,796
I may have to do it again.
Maybe he'll come gently.

53
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,550
Girls, time for your nap. Beat it.

54
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,273
- Hey!
- See you later.

55
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,833
- Up, lover boy. Get up.
- You're a spoilsport.

56
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,713
Harmon's coming in.
Should I go to the airport?

57
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,592
I sent Steffans there.

58
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,312
Everything last minute.

59
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,672
Harmon should've been
in on the scam weeks ago.

60
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,319
The whole crew should.

61
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,595
What about this Sam Harmon?
Why from Hawaii? What's so special?

62
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,676
Who says he can be trusted?

63
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,954
Sam Harmon is Ocean's closest friend.

64
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,953
Another closest friend?
What about Foster?

65
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,957
Before Foster, from way back!

66
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,757
We were in the commandos.
Ocean saved his life.

67
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,114
Hey, Sam. Sam Harmon!

68
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,754
That takes care of me.
Let's get to you.

69
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,838
George Steffans.
Curly. Curly Steffans.

70
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,349
Curly. Of course,
I'd know you anywhere.

71
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,915
You haven't changed either.
You look great, kid.

72
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,197
Is Danny gonna go through
with this commando raid?

73
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,879
Just like the old days.

74
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,270
Who is this Acebos? What is he?

75
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,233
Planning division. He dreamed it up.

76
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,749
Jimmy and Danny did the coordination.

77
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,109
What is he, a con?

78
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,788
- Leavenworth.
- Where'd Danny meet him?

79
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,077
Who knows? A racetrack, a nightclub.

80
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,193
- Same old Danny.
- Yeah, he likes action.

81
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,312
- Still married?
- Yeah, but not working at it.

82
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,318
That figures. Soldier, fatigue detail.

83
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,433
Put this footlocker in my car.
Hold it.

84
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,355
- What can I do for you?
- I'd like to see the proprietor.

85
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,788
You're looking at him.

86
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,434
Doesn't Tony Bergdorf own this shop?

87
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,834
Not anymore.

88
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,313
Where can I find him?
I'm a friend of his.

89
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,273
That's him. That's me.

90
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,517
What I have to tell you
isn't a nice thing.

91
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,835
He's in prison.

92
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,429
- Shorty Bergdorf?
- San Quentin.

93
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,679
- Where can I find his wife?
- I have her address.

94
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,469
I'll get it for you in a minute.

95
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,716
May I call long distance?

96
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,229
- Long distance?
- I'll reverse it.

97
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,796
- All right.
- Thank you.

98
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,513
- Hello. Yes, I'll take the call.
<i>- Go ahead, please.</i>

99
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,233
Corneal, it's Mushy.

100
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,716
It's not Phoenix.
This is Acebos. Go ahead.

101
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,590
<i>Tony Bergdorf is in San Quentin</i>
<i>doing one to five.</i>

102
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,874
He's in prison, the electrician.

103
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,271
Our master electrician
is doing one to five!

104
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,070
Make it a little short, please.

105
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,553
Here, Miss Allenby.

106
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,594
Thank you, Mrs. Bergdorf.
Mr. Allenby'll be so pleased.

107
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,917
- They're our very own children.
- I know.

108
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,798
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Thank you.

109
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,679
Mommy's so pleased to have you home.

110
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,317
- Gracie!
- Roger Corneal!

111
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,239
- Where did you come from?
- Been a long time.

112
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,637
A lifetime! Wasn't it
our first anniversary?

113
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,070
Do you remember those rum drinks?

114
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,555
I haven't had rum since.

115
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,474
Those were the olden, golden days.

116
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,476
- You know about Tony?
- Yes. It's a shame.

117
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,990
- He gets out tomorrow.
- But they gave him one to five.

118
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,839
They gave him an amnesty.
I don't know why.

119
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,951
That Danny, always a step ahead.

120
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,316
- Pardon?
- I'm just mumbling.

121
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,711
Will you have Tony call me
when he gets home?

122
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,434
He won't be coming home.
That's finished.

123
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,393
I didn't know that.
Won't he see the kid?

124
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,871
Sure, but he'll see him
at the military school...

125
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,275
...in the presence of Major Taylor.

126
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,511
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.

127
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,629
I can't ignore
the possibility of him...

128
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,115
...being a bad influence on Timmy.

129
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,317
This time it must be Ocean.

130
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,675
- Hello. Who?
<i>- Mr. Corneal.</i>

131
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,909
- Corneal again.
<i>- Will you accept the call?</i>

132
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,680
Yes, I'll accept the call.

133
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,310
That man sure likes telephones.

134
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,391
Come in. I'll be right with you.

135
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,473
Hey, Sam. Get them up. Get them up.

136
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,912
You look great. Is that what
a diet of wahines does?

137
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,277
- You get them up now.
- Shoot one in there.

138
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,993
Fellows, I can't hear.

139
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,077
You look human. Quit fighting?

140
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,271
Sam, I ran out of scar tissue.

141
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,552
Yeah, hold it a minute, Corneal.

142
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,235
Avail yourself of my hospitality,
Mr. Harmon.

143
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,908
Scotch.

144
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,149
<i>Tomorrow morning.</i>

145
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,796
Tomorrow morning? Wait.
Yes, proceed, proceed.

146
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,195
<i>- Just listen.</i>
- Sure, I'm listening.

147
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,833
I'm a very happy man.

148
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,479
No, no, I said I'm a... Never mind.
Go on. Thanks, Corneal.

149
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,877
It's excellent what you did.
Yes, excellent.

150
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,595
Goodbye. Another crisis lived through.

151
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,756
They're letting Bergdorf out.
Giving him an amnesty.

152
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,070
Some joke.

153
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,478
I bet Ocean knew it,
but he wouldn't tell me.

154
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,358
No, he wouldn't.

155
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,394
He's gotta torture me.
Eat my heart out.

156
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,828
He likes it.

157
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,396
You're not making yourself
popular knocking Danny.

158
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,710
Who's knocking him? I love him.

159
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,159
I respect talent.

160
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,955
- He should love me a little.
- Too tough. Don't ask.

161
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,673
How about that?
A little hand for Lolita.

162
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,118
Now a sweet bundle from Texas,
sweet as candy.

163
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,869
The tantalizing Honeyface.

164
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,200
Sorry about the interruption.
I got a job to do.

165
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,550
What's the word, Vince?

166
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,515
- I never figured you'd go this route.
- Vince, the plan is foolproof.

167
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,278
I only lie to girls.

168
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,119
If it is, why hasn't
somebody done it yet?

169
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,118
Same reason nobody's gone
to the moon.

170
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,154
It's gonna be a military operation
by trained men.

171
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,393
Why waste those tricks
the army taught us...

172
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,636
...because it's peaceful now?

173
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,389
You remember a bit
called Operation Gold in Oran?

174
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,471
Eleven of us on a beach...

175
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,276
...with a rubber boat
and six million in gold bars.

176
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,828
- We should've buried them.
- We got shovels this time.

177
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,359
What do you say, Vince?

178
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,998
I can't do it.
I got my wife to think of.

179
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,509
- Think of her rich.
- Or me dead.

180
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,517
Stop talking like a kid.

181
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,639
You went through the war.
Why should you get dead now?

182
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,432
You're indestructible.

183
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,076
I'm sorry. I'd go along
with you, but my wife...

184
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,275
- When does she come on?
- She's on.

185
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,070
- Is that her?
- Why? What're you thinking?

186
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,713
She's a very lovely girl.

187
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,311
I'd like to take you home
and spread you on my waffle.

188
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,509
Yahoo.

189
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,109
There's only two.

190
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,872
He begs for a job.
Now he's dumping customers.

191
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,951
- Let's get the bum out.
- Okay, Al.

192
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,595
- Now?
- Now's the time.

193
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,155
- What's the matter with you?
- Hold it.

194
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,633
Hey, what's the big idea?

195
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,000
- Oh, stop it!
- Go that way!

196
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,798
- Come on, boys.
- Come on.

197
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,913
I didn't figure to come across
a brawl so far inland.

198
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,270
If you still want me, I'm in.

199
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,517
All right, you're in.
Could be a little itchy.

200
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,514
I don't care. I'm tired of having
bums yell at my wife.

201
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,479
I don't want her to take
it one more night.

202
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,554
Neither do I, Vince.

203
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,078
Here, take that.

204
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,635
Shucks, Danny.

205
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,274
Cut it out. Here's a plane ticket.

206
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,469
When you get there...

207
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,911
Go to this address.
Ask for Josh Howard.

208
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,758
- Josh's in with you?
- Yeah.

209
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,349
- I feel better already.
- Good.

210
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,913
Heard anything about Louis Jackson?

211
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,996
- Salt Lake City, last I heard.
- We hear that too.

212
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,475
We'll see you in a few days.

213
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,871
What'll I tell my wife?

214
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,198
Tell her you love her.

215
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,470
That'll hold her for a few weeks.

216
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,070
It's fun time, Jimmy. I'll give him
a party, you make drinks.

217
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,391
Jimmy Foster. Are you there?

218
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,435
How can you do this? You I relied on.
I had confidence in you.

219
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,274
From the other one
I knew what to expect.

220
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,957
<i>He's hopeless, undisciplined.</i>
<i>That's why I sent you with him.</i>

221
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,116
Hello, Spyros, how are you?

222
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,711
Get away from that phone.
I won't talk to you! I won't!

223
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,480
<i>All you know is to give me heartache.</i>

224
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,958
Spyros, I got good news and bad.

225
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,559
Don't tell me the bad.
That I got plenty. Tell me the good.

226
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,793
We're leaving Phoenix.

227
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,715
They're leaving Phoenix.
Darling, that's wonderful.

228
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,232
Why didn't you tell me?
Tell me what's the bad news.

229
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,870
We're going to Salt Lake City.

230
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,279
They're going to Salt Lake City.

231
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,797
Left, left, right, left, left...

232
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,715
Well, say hello to your father, Timmy.

233
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,909
- Hi.
- Hello, sir.

234
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,192
Don't I get a kiss,
or are you too old for that?

235
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,515
Sorry, sir.

236
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,111
Your clothes smell funny.

237
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,272
- I came from a faraway place.
- I know, Japan.

238
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,875
That's right. Japan.

239
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,872
I didn't change.
I was afraid I'd miss you.

240
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,390
- Miss me, sir?
- Don't you go home on weekends?

241
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,354
Mother said you'd come
to see me and I had to stay.

242
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,597
I'm sorry if I spoiled your
weekend with her.

243
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,070
But maybe you and I
can do something.

244
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,913
Maybe we can go to a movie,
have ice cream?

245
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,677
- A football game?
- I'd like that, sir!

246
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,599
Good. I'll call
for you next Saturday.

247
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,472
- Yes, sir.
- Right?

248
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,073
Dad!

249
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,993
- You won't forget, Dad?
- No, Timmy. I won't forget.

250
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,476
Merry Christmas, Dad.
I made it myself.

251
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,069
Well.

252
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,474
Wait a minute. Roger Corneal.

253
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,589
First man in the 82nd to be fined
for fraternizing with the Fräuleins.

254
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,189
The first man to greet me. How come?

255
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,710
I saw Grace.
Your kid glad to see you?

256
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,349
- Look what he made me.
- Those beads?

257
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,120
It's an abacus.
You add and subtract on it.

258
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,836
- That is clever.
- Yeah. Grace told him I was in Japan.

259
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,952
She couldn't tell the kid
where I really was.

260
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,394
No, I guess not.

261
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,352
How are things with you?

262
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,471
We need a master electrician.

263
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,671
- Who's we?
- Our old outfit.

264
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,279
You mean Jimmy Foster and...

265
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,357
Danny Ocean, Sam, Josh.

266
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,676
They all got together? What's up?

267
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,876
It's a reunion.

268
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,711
We have been getting things
ready for weeks.

269
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,748
- Sounds like a whale of a party.
- Bigger than Anzio.

270
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,913
Only you won't get paid
in invasion money.

271
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,476
It'll be the real long green.
Stacks of it.

272
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,674
Sounds like the kind of reunion that
can put me back into Calendar Hall.

273
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,037
Tony. Tony.

274
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,232
Hup, two, three, four.

275
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,668
Tony?

276
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,915
You have to take a chance
to get rich.

277
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,677
Look, Rog, the last joker who
fed me that line was a jeweler.

278
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,156
He wanted me to short-circuit
his alarm.

279
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,480
He got sixty grand, I got one to five.
I lost my wife and kid.

280
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,438
Funny, I thought I was
doing it for her.

281
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,195
She always wanted a white fox stole.

282
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,638
This time it'll take you one
to five to count your loot.

283
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,838
No, sorry. I got things to do
on the outside.

284
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,593
And I'm gonna stay there.

285
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,912
Besides, if I went in on it,
you'd be licked.

286
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,317
I used to be unlucky only for myself.

287
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,476
Now I'm unlucky for everybody.
See you around.

288
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,829
Didn't you get medical attention?

289
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,396
- Yes, sir.
- Then what made you come to me?

290
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,229
Dr. Griffin said
I ought to see a specialist.

291
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,312
He made the appointment.

292
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,873
Look, doc...

293
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,473
...give it to me straight.

294
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,998
Is it the big casino?

295
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,913
I can't tell until
I've seen the report.

296
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,078
What if the report says it is?
How long?

297
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,034
Well, I...

298
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,472
How long, doc?

299
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,554
What do you say, Tony?
You can still change your mind.

300
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,599
- Will it be enough for college?
- Enough to buy your kid a college.

301
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,390
- Come on, Josh. Your turn.
- All right.

302
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,080
Vince! Vincerinio!

303
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,112
How are you?

304
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,190
You're a tough guy to catch up with.

305
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,749
Trash is where you find it.

306
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,269
What happened to the ball-playing?

307
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,478
No see.
When I got out of the Army...

308
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,794
...the only club open was down South.
No outfield spot.

309
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,033
Imagine how I would've made
out, a one-eyed third baseman.

310
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,474
I always leveled with you, didn't I?

311
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,719
I'm stringing along with this,
but I'm scared.

312
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,674
No panic, just a little something
gets me up in here.

313
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,509
That's the only way to be.
Makes you careful.

314
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,316
Look, Vince, the brave ones
don't come home. You stay scared.

315
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,990
You were one who didn't want
any brave ones with you.

316
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,959
That's simple enough.

317
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,755
In my book, bravery rhymes with stupid.

318
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,915
Some yellow-belly. Imagine the
damn Army giving you the DSM.

319
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,714
I was scared the day I won that.

320
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,635
Don't mention it now.
My knees start to shake again.

321
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,073
How come this doesn't make you shake?

322
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,673
It does.

323
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,832
A million bucks apiece.
Guess you figure the odds are right?

324
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,677
Vince, baby boy,
I figure it is like this:

325
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,992
The 11 of us cats
against this one little city.

326
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,909
We're an overlay.

327
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,070
Okay, pal,
I'm ready for the briefing.

328
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,471
Then step into my office.

329
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,709
- Sam Harmon.
- Well, merry Christmas, Mrs. Ocean.

330
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,078
What are you doing here?

331
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,630
Stop getting prettier.
You'll turn into a monopoly.

332
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,110
I asked you why are you here.

333
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,108
I got scared I'd get tired
from those leis around my neck.

334
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,994
Sweet-talking Sam.
Danny still in bed?

335
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,390
- Not exactly.
- He's in the hospital?

336
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,909
- No.
- Because some doctor called...

337
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,515
...and said Danny was very sick.

338
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,072
Frankly, that doctor was me.

339
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,188
In fact the message said he was dying.

340
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,396
I wanted to make sure you'd come.

341
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,388
- Dying was what gave it away.
- You knew it was a gag?

342
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,717
It's the sort of stunt Danny
usually pulls.

343
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,275
Why'd you come over if you knew?

344
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,956
It's Christmas. I have a present
for him, simple as that.

345
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,398
Now what's your excuse?

346
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,593
I was wondering.
I come to the conclusion...

347
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,071
...it must be love. Mother love.

348
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,916
I'll consider mistress,
toy for a night...

349
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,071
...but I refuse to be your mother.

350
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,475
You got it all wrong. I'm the mother.

351
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,678
I just don't like you and Danny
busting up.

352
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,679
Yeah.

353
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,470
We're sort of eye to eye there.

354
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,837
I'd like to straighten him out.

355
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,472
No, Mother.
He's the only one who can do that.

356
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,191
What happened to your marriage, Bea?

357
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,033
It drowned in champagne.

358
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,949
I didn't think it got boring
on cloud nine.

359
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,278
Boring, no. I just woke up
one morning and realized...

360
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,478
...there was nothing but thin air.

361
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,912
So I got off at the next mountain,
walked down and got a job.

362
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,273
Danny didn't like that very well.

363
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,750
And a little later I left him.

364
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,039
How'd he feel about that?

365
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,791
He wants me back, but not
enough to give me what I want.

366
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,429
Such as?

367
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,678
I want a life that doesn't depend
on the color of a card.

368
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,229
Danny ran into a little bad luck?

369
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,395
If only he had.
Might've made him realize...

370
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,353
...what things mean
when you earn them.

371
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,070
We didn't have a home.
We had a floating crap game.

372
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,633
That's a way of running
away from life.

373
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,433
- I better go.
- Danny'll be here any minute.

374
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,437
I have a job to get back to.

375
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,999
I don't wanna see him anyway, Sam.
Just no point in it.

376
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,030
Danny's not the only one running.

377
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,759
Don't hack at me, Mother.

378
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,269
His luck is bound to run out.

379
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,869
If he still wants me, I'll be around.

380
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,797
- Hello, Danny.
- Wait a minute.

381
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,353
Down, please.

382
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,357
I came in with a fellow.

383
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,677
A fickle fellow.
You stick with me. I'm sincere.

384
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,279
I got great news.

385
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,311
Auburn beat Alabama.

386
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,351
No, this is important, honestly.

387
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,398
Come on back upstairs
for five minutes.

388
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,115
- No, Danny. Down, please.
- Up, all the way.

389
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,072
The Skyroom's not open yet.

390
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,396
- Fine.
- Why do I always give in?

391
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,359
Not another round.
I'm out of training.

392
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,951
- It's a truce. Peace talk.
- You always start that way.

393
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,148
Just sit there
and don't interrupt me.

394
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,515
I've got a big deal going on.
Large chips, carloads.

395
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,514
- That sounds familiar.
- But this time it's true.

396
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,274
Oh, good. I like to have rich friends.

397
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,278
One friend who wants
to spend a bundle on you.

398
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,592
- Gee, thanks.
- Okay, that's settled.

399
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,595
On January 2nd, I'll pick you up
and we're gonna hop down to Rio.

400
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,550
You're serious?
I honestly think you're serious.

401
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,233
Of course I am.

402
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,317
- A week's trip to Rio.
- Yes.

403
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,710
Oh, Danny, what a prize you are.

404
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,198
The only husband who'd
proposition his wife.

405
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,073
I married you. It didn't work out.
What's wrong with some hey-hey?

406
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,316
Nothing. Nothing at all.

407
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,278
I'd never knock it if
there was love involved.

408
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,190
- You mean there isn't?
- On your part, not much.

409
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,792
There's only one thing you love,
Danny. Danger.

410
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,799
Cliffhanging.

411
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,433
You'd never love a woman
like you love danger.

412
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,349
As long as you're lucky
you'll stay in love with danger.

413
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,439
- As long as it keeps coming up heads.
- Let's say you're right.

414
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,309
- But I did not invent myself.
- What does that mean?

415
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,230
I don't own the patent. I can't
change it any more than you can.

416
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,556
Anyone who says he can is a liar.

417
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,479
I didn't expect you to be perfect.

418
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,910
- Going down.
- Just a second.

419
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,270
You could have given me a break.

420
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,956
I don't expect you to be perfect.
I want you to be my husband.

421
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,669
Going down.

422
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,354
- Where do they serve the drinks?
- The bar.

423
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,354
- James.
- Hello there, Sam.

424
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,428
Don't stop.
I'm just calling Mother.

425
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,917
- Hello.
- Mrs. Restes' residence.

426
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,111
<i>- Is Mother there?</i>
- Yes, Mr. Foster.

427
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,677
- Oh, it's my Jimmy, my innocent.
- Another innocent touch.

428
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,072
- Jimmy. Where have you been?
<i>- Here and there.</i>

429
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,236
It was wicked not to telephone.

430
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,476
- We've been home days.
<i>- What? We?</i>

431
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,593
We? We means your poor Ionely
mother and Mr. Santos.

432
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,956
I wrote you about him, I think.

433
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,192
He's been very kind
and a financial genius.

434
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,837
- What I hoped you'd be.
- Yes, Mother. Speaking of finances.

435
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,512
- Could you let me have some more?
<i>- Some more what?</i>

436
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,838
Money. M-O-N-Y.

437
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,033
- E!
- Yeah, M-O-N-E-Y.

438
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,113
Yes, darling.
Tell me what you want it for.

439
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,870
I plan to paper the walls with it.

440
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,914
<i>I try to take an interest</i>
<i>in you, you snap my head off.</i>

441
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,432
How do I know what I'll spend it on?
It just goes, you know?

442
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,150
You mean spending money.
Why didn't you say so?

443
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,994
I was afraid you'd consider
an investment.

444
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,112
No, Mother, nothing foolish.

445
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,559
Hurry over and bring me a big kiss.

446
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,318
I wanna see my big boy.

447
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,318
Yes, Mother. I'll be there around 5.

448
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,516
What a way to make a living.

449
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,479
Let's have a quick briefing on Hawaii.

450
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,549
Hawaii? Oh, great sunsets.

451
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,794
One a day,
but they're working on it.

452
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,999
- Weather good to get me up?
- Sometimes it rains.

453
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,193
- And how about the women?
- Sometimes it rains.

454
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,478
Did you take a good look at Bea?

455
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,231
Not really.
The play went around the other end.

456
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,598
- She's still in love with Danny.
- Then what's the problem?

457
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,952
- Yeah, I'm worried about him.
- Worried?

458
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,759
- Maybe the project worries you.
- Could be part of it.

459
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,876
You trying to salt the clouds,
spoil the picnic?

460
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,357
Jimmy, what do you need
this picnic for?

461
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,313
All you have to do is yell for Mother.

462
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,357
You haven't met Mother.

463
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,150
No, but I gather she's very generous.

464
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,953
Generous to a fault.
Especially when it comes to husbands.

465
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,152
She only had five.

466
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,792
That must have left
you out in the cold?

467
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,957
No such luck.

468
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,395
Would you mind spelling that out?

469
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,069
I had so much mother-Iove,
you'd have thought I was quintuplets.

470
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,397
Everything was done for me.

471
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,553
After the war I tried
to break away.

472
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,959
But money's a hard habit to kick.

473
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,956
That's why I'll go to our picnic.

474
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,318
Well, the Hawaiian hotshot.

475
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,715
- Hi, Danny.
- Sam, how are you?

476
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,716
Same as always. I feel the thrill
of life along the keel.

477
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,156
You sound like a ferryboat.

478
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,756
I'm not a boat, I'm a manly slope.

479
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,635
- People stare at me in admiration.
- What happens?

480
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,877
Let's get back to how I was.
I was fine.

481
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,997
Will you get Spyros on the phone?

482
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,196
I got into this caper
so I could see you again.

483
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,437
Sounds like a hell of a price.
I'm worth it.

484
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,198
In time for the jokes.

485
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,953
For you, Mr. Acebos. Very important.

486
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,039
- Hello.
- The Los Angeles County morgue.

487
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,674
Los Angeles County morgue. Yes?

488
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,836
We have a couple of men here.

489
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,554
One is well-muscled
and the other slender.

490
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,233
My goodness.

491
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,558
These fellows were traveling fast
in an automobile.

492
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,555
<i>Their names are...</i>

493
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,515
Never mind, never mind their names.
I know the... I knew them.

494
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,911
Would you identify them?

495
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,715
I'm willing. I'll come down.
I'll be right there.

496
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,152
My goodness, yes.
And what is your name, please?

497
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,949
Just ask for Detective Brannigan.

498
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,197
Detective Bra...

499
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,278
How did he get my name?

500
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,952
Let's saddle up. Let's go.

501
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,153
I finally caught up with you.
Where have you been for days?

502
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,476
You back with your wife?

503
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,593
I know she was in this hotel
with you an hour ago.

504
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,915
You're two-timing me,
and I'm warning you, Danny...

505
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,597
...I'm one girl you can't treat
this way. I won't be neglected.

506
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,439
- What do you plan to do about it?
- I'm going to do just plenty.

507
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,715
- Isn't it time you got started?
- Wait a minute.

508
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,992
No, you wait and listen
to me carefully.

509
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,313
I picked you up at the Biltmore
because you're attractive.

510
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,909
I made a pass at you for that reason.

511
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,714
Nobody twisted your arm...

512
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,074
...made you any promises. So, what
is this act? Not outraged virtue.

513
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,471
You really are a rat.

514
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,870
Let it go, Adele. I know about the
guys you've had. You told me.

515
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,638
I didn't do anything.

516
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,434
Neither did I.
So why don't we say goodbye?

517
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,350
Surely. And maybe I should say
thank you for being humiliated.

518
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,716
Well, put this in your pipe.

519
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,636
One of these days I'll break
your back! I swear it!

520
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,358
- Good thing she doesn't pack a knife.
- How do you know?

521
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,953
To the morgue.

522
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,559
You...

523
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,150
You low, miserable...

524
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,436
I cry but not for you.
For my money you could drop dead.

525
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,428
I think he's mad. Back to the hotel.

526
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,234
You stay right here.

527
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,115
You, come out of that cab.
So I'm mad, I'm entitled!

528
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,153
Okay, Spyros, we accept your apology.

529
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,433
No phone call.

530
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,440
With all these jokes you forgot
to call who should be here.

531
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,993
I wanted to check on you.

532
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,555
- See if you're still alive.
- Alive?

533
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,910
Well, you're so apoplectic.

534
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,796
My health is my greatest virtue.
Every day I do exercises.

535
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,797
Everybody'll be here at 9:00.

536
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,754
Then you can entertain us
by doing some deep knee-bends.

537
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,798
- Good evening.
- My mother home?

538
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,197
- She expects you, but she's upstairs.
- Thank you.

539
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,036
- You must be Jimmy.
- That's correct.

540
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,550
Your mama will be down in a minute.
I'm Duke Santos.

541
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,635
I'll wait in here.

542
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,999
Must be a funny feeling...

543
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,794
...meeting a stranger,
your stepfather.

544
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,117
I think it's only natural
if you resent me a little.

545
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,758
Then you won't mind
if I don't call you Dad.

546
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,309
Duke's okay.

547
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,598
Oh, it's the engagement ring
I bought your mama.

548
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,076
That's nice. Zircon, isn't it?

549
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,033
- Zircon? That's a diamond!
- I'm sorry.

550
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,551
You probably thought that
because it's so big.

551
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,792
Is it too big?
Your mama's got wonderful taste.

552
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,759
Has she?

553
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,550
All right, rich boy.
You want it that way, you got it.

554
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,234
Let's see how fat you get
tangling with me.

555
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,113
I know your record
and your connections.

556
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,954
A lot of loot and
a rough guy to cross.

557
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,358
But I still reserve the right
to dislike you.

558
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,431
Sure, sure. A man marries your mama...

559
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,552
...like I said, it's natural.
Takes time.

560
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,955
- You'll find I can be a good Joe.
- I'll tell the FBI.

561
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,914
Oh, they're not looking
for me anymore. I'm clear now.

562
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,756
That's one point for Mother.

563
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,757
Easy for you to look down
on people, isn't it?

564
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,720
All this ever since he was a baby.
You ever make a buck yourself?

565
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,279
No, but I have plans.

566
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,553
Know what I had as a kid?
A lot of nothing.

567
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,955
Nobody to help me either.
Now I got a lot of everything.

568
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,757
Got a lot of years too,
and a sick stomach.

569
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,391
Proves that my way's better.

570
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,359
- What way?
- Choose rich parents.

571
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,349
Yeah, you bet that's better.

572
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,550
My folks are so poor I walked
New York barefoot winter and summer.

573
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,796
One day I'm swimming in the river.

574
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,673
When I come out I seen
shoes on the wharf.

575
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,272
One pair brand-new.
I put them on. They fit.

576
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,150
Then some kid yells, " Them's
my shoes! " So we fight. I win.

577
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,558
It's been that way since.
Fight, all the time.

578
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,360
- You always win?
- Sure, I got the guts!

579
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,758
Like you when you was in the 82nd
Airborne. Your mama told me.

580
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,354
I've often wondered if I'd have
the guts to jump out of a plane.

581
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,597
Only for money.

582
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,751
Or if I was young.

583
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,760
You gotta be young to do anything.

584
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,670
Loosen up.
Have a drink to my wedding.

585
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,154
Why not?

586
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,518
- Soda?
- What about you?

587
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,472
Not me. I told you, delicate.

588
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,353
Come on, Mr. Santos.
Fight, always fight.

589
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,993
You got the guts, you win.

590
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,352
- Yeah, but...
- What's the matter? Run out of guts?

591
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,750
- Darling! At last.
- Hello, Mother.

592
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,229
What's wrong with Duke?

593
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,238
A slight attack of courage.
We had a drink.

594
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,793
He knows he can't touch it.

595
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,070
He told me.
Naughty of me, wasn't it?

596
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,238
Indeed. Not congratulating me
is naughty too.

597
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,034
I'm sorry. Bon voyage.

598
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,312
It must seem I'm on
a marital merry-go-round...

599
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,751
...trying for all the rings,
but this is different.

600
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,313
You can say that again.

601
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,909
I know his background
is impossible...

602
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,953
...but please don't judge him
from that view.

603
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,591
What view do you suggest?

604
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,633
- A woman's.
- I find that impractical.

605
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,354
Try. Since your father died...

606
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,276
...Duke is the only man who's
ever needed me, not my money.

607
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,951
All right, I won't be critical.
And now speaking of money...

608
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,639
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

609
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,118
A woman loves to be needed. Duke
is the most important thing.

610
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,033
Outside of you. So please be nice.

611
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,789
When I get back I'll butter him up.
Sorry I needled him.

612
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,069
Where are you going?

613
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,078
I'm going skiing with Danny Ocean.

614
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,793
You won't miss the wedding?

615
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,993
- Have I ever missed one of them?
- Yes, the first one.

616
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,992
- Bye.
- Bye, darling.

617
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,557
It's after 9.
Everybody's here but this Jackson.

618
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,156
Shall we start without him?

619
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,520
Lack of organization, it's a poison!

620
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,393
It poisons enterprise,
kills it dead, dead.

621
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,912
The point in having money
is so that people know you got it.

622
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,272
I'll get me a big Chris Craft
and not put into water.

623
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,391
Just leave it in my driveway.

624
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,915
Give it to the mailman or somebody.

625
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,588
Why don't you use it
to improve yourself?

626
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,156
I don't need improving.
I'm all right the way I am.

627
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,159
Gin.

628
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,231
I played it like a god.

629
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,317
How many points?

630
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,557
They got 10 points.
Why don't you guys be smart?

631
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,550
Why don't you put your loot in
with me? I'll produce my own pictures.

632
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,433
I gotta listen to all this.
They're rotting my brain.

633
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,352
So where is this Jackson?

634
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,397
Where is the organization?

635
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,557
Don't panic, will you?

636
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,599
You know, it's a good idea.

637
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,591
Take a few big ones
and do something for world peace.

638
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,753
Like buying out
the Miss Universe contest.

639
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,474
Just sit around
and talk to the girls.

640
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,955
Find out how things are in Sweden.

641
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,353
Or invite them for a weekend
to New Orleans.

642
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,836
I don't like that approach.
Use your loot right...

643
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,715
...you can order them to New Orleans.

644
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,550
- Explain that, professor?
- By turning money into power.

645
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,195
I'll buy votes and go into politics.

646
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,188
Good idea, big boy.
You'd make a good notary public.

647
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,512
He'd make a better coroner.
A laughing coroner.

648
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,951
- I'm going into politics.
- Your platform, Big Sam?

649
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,711
Repeal the 14th and 20th amendment,
make slaves out of women.

650
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,956
That's real constructive.

651
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,752
Hey, will it cost much?

652
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,509
No, we'd have the price controlled.

653
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,757
Vote for Sam Harmon.
Stamp out mental health.

654
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,951
- Got a better platform?
- Sure.

655
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,515
Settle for an appointment.

656
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,077
That's deep thinking. I'd like you
to meet our latest senator.

657
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,231
What a terrible thought.

658
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,597
Become an ambassador
in a foreign country.

659
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,519
A little country.
We don't want a big enemy.

660
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,075
Yeah, little country like Andorra.

661
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,396
- Or Pomona.
- Little Rock?

662
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,869
You have any idea how
much money a man can steal...

663
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,436
...if he was
commissioner of Indian Affairs?

664
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,393
- That's what I'll be.
- That you'll never be.

665
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,275
I'll be secretary of the interior.
I won't appoint you.

666
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,879
That's a snobbish idea.

667
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,433
- Won't you?
- I won't.

668
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,269
Certitude went out
with equestrian statuary.

669
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,751
- What kind of language is that?
- Beats me.

670
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,032
If you ask me,
that cat's a spy there.

671
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,950
So where is this horse-wrangler? 9:30!

672
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,149
Still in Salt Lake City,
saying goodbye to his wives.

673
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,356
- And his horses.
- Yeah.

674
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,950
Up and down.
And the houseboy's night off yet.

675
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,433
- Mr. Acebos?
- Who's asking?

676
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,557
He is.
Do you know him?

677
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,872
Oh, Jackson. Louis, my boy...

678
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,749
What's wrong?
Louis, you did something?

679
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,396
No, we wanted to be sure
he got to the right place.

680
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,115
The Beverly Hills police.
The best in America.

681
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,438
They protect us night and day.
Thank you, officer.

682
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,154
Good night. You're crippled!

683
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,476
That's the way we found him.

684
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,830
- Good night.
- Good night.

685
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,951
Louis, my boy, come in.

686
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,711
I couldn't be in error, could...?

687
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,997
I couldn't be in error, could I?

688
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,910
Your name couldn't be
otherwise than Jackson?

689
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,234
No, I reckon that's my name, partner.

690
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,556
Don't tell me why you had to come
in such a pitiable condition.

691
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,350
Suits me, Mr. Acebos.
Hello, Danny.

692
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,518
Hello, cowboy. What took you so long?

693
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,395
Hot damn, what a foxhole.
Howdy, you all.

694
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,752
- Hello, Josh.
- How are you?

695
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,712
Good. Great. Sam?

696
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,637
Ocean, you should be ashamed
of yourself.

697
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,673
Enticing a broken-armed man
into a project.

698
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,475
You know your problem?
You underestimate people. Louis?

699
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,112
What's with the broken arm?

700
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,757
Why shucks, Mr. Acebos,
it's all healed now.

701
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:21,270
You knew, you Dracula. You want
to worry me into an early grave.

702
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,352
Lieutenant, brief your group.

703
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,355
Anyone not at ease, get that way.

704
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,791
Some of you already have an idea
of the plan of this operation.

705
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,033
I want to point out
that everyone turned up.

706
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,359
Not one goof-off.

707
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,592
This is a hell of a good sign.

708
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,793
Lieutenant, you and the sergeant
ought to feel proud.

709
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,753
How about the bad news?

710
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,958
Sergeant Ocean.

711
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,989
This is our objective.
Las Vegas, Nevada.

712
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,351
Mission? To liberate millions
of dollars.

713
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,716
Now these are the casinos we hit:

714
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,999
Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn,
the Sands and the Flamingo.

715
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,993
H hour is New Year's Eve.
Units involve...

716
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,990
...teams made up of former
82nd Airborne members.

717
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,914
How did you figure this was
a job for old paratroopers?

718
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,111
Why not get some heist guys?

719
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,436
For the best reasons, Mr. Harmon.

720
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,800
A man with a criminal record can't
get near Las Vegas or the casinos.

721
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,474
That lets me out.

722
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,229
You're no hoodlum.
No connection with the underworld.

723
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,590
Hoods always mix with other hoods.

724
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,954
Where there're hoods, there're stool
pigeons. But with us, no leaks.

725
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,114
You five guys, which hotels you in?

726
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,958
- Flamingo.
- The Sands.

727
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,394
- Desert Inn.
- Riviera.

728
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,589
Sahara.

729
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,679
There'll be five more men working
with you guys as teams.

730
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,954
Sam, give me a rundown on
the exact action on New Year's Eve.

731
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,391
At midnight they go nuts.
Everybody kisses.

732
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,110
Then they sing, " Should auld
acquaintance be forgot."

733
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,389
- How long does it take to sing that?
- I don't know.

734
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,354
One minute and 38 seconds exactly.
We timed it.

735
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,112
After midnight we black out...

736
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,073
...the whole town and hit
the five casinos.

737
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,750
Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn...

738
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,358
...the Sands and the Flamingo.
Nobody will even see us.

739
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,433
You got a question, Tony?

740
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,995
How do you black out a whole town?

741
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,268
What happens if you
knock out one of these towers?

742
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,029
- You'll get a short circuit.
- That's interesting.

743
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,195
Reimer and Josh are
the demolition men. What's my job?

744
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,716
You open the doors
to the cashiers' cages.

745
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,956
They are controlled electrically.

746
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,357
The cashier can open them
by pushing a button.

747
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,074
But I can't push it from the outside.

748
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,272
But that's where
you're gonna push it from.

749
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,679
Every casino's got a motor
that generates power...

750
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,395
...for the tables and cages
when the cable fails...

751
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,431
...which happens quite often.

752
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,468
The motor kicks in,
and they're back in business.

753
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,036
Except they won't
on account of you, Tony.

754
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,676
What happens if you cross the wires...

755
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,475
...that operate lights
with the cage doors' wires?

756
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,555
When the motor kicks in,
instead of the lights going on...

757
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,038
...the doors click open.

758
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,598
It's as simple as that.

759
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,873
But I have to study the main
switch box in each casino.

760
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,236
Oh, but you will, you will.

761
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,549
Is this the only road in or out?

762
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,512
Yeah, that's route 91. Why?

763
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,518
I remember reading about
this guy in Perth.

764
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,676
Is this another of your stories?

765
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,229
- Who cut up his grandmother.
- Fellows, let him talk.

766
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,989
And mailed her out of town.

767
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,631
- He ran out of stamps.
- Which proves something crucial?

768
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,354
Pete's got a very good point.

769
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,155
Getting it out of town,
that's another thing.

770
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,920
- That's where Josh comes in.
- I wondered.

771
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,634
Don't wonder. He's the main cog.

772
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,276
- Lf he goofs, it's over.
- What's wrinkling you, Curly?

773
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,436
How long will it stay dark?

774
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,359
- 10, 15 minutes.
- That's not much time.

775
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,358
It's plenty if everyone
does what he should.

776
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,828
Danny is right.

777
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,352
You should all move like clockwork.
Seventeen jewel.

778
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:00,588
Boys, you should think of this
as a full-fledged battle.

779
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,118
Leap into it with
the same hearts...

780
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,949
...that got you across
the Rhine River and...

781
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,076
...other historical places.
Just think how proud...

782
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,635
...the big brass in the Pentagon...

783
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,071
...would be knowing that
their labors made...

784
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,794
...this beautiful operation possible.

785
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,032
They'd all sit down
in the officers' mess...

786
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,277
...and have a good cry from happiness.

787
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,238
Even I myself am a little bit tempted.

788
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,913
- Any further questions?
- Yeah. What's your job, Acebos?

789
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,711
Yeah, Mr. Acebos,
what you all gonna do?

790
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,480
Our modest friend here
is a known felon.

791
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,558
They take one look at him
and we're kaput.

792
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,509
- That's it.
- More questions? Anybody worried?

793
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,073
I got a suggestion.

794
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,117
- What is it, Sam?
- Forget it.

795
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,074
Forget...?

796
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,955
Forget the whole deal.
I like to swing like you...

797
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,151
...but you ain't got a plan here.

798
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:08,559
Is this another of your morbid jokes,
Danny, you sadist?

799
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,400
- What's wrong with our story, Sam?
- For one thing, 15 years.

800
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,559
This isn't a combat team.

801
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,389
You wanna claim you're
half the man you were in '45?

802
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,551
Can you run as fast?

803
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,712
Can you mix it up as good?
I sure can't.

804
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,993
Danny, catch lightning,
but don't try and catch yesterday.

805
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,760
Old times are only good
when you've had them.

806
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,558
Sam...

807
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,312
...some guys grow old
without turning chicken.

808
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,834
Did you hear about it?

809
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,788
Lieutenant Lionheart, you're brave.

810
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,039
But how dumb are you? I'm the only
one that knows Las Vegas.

811
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,273
Believe me, the percentage
is always with the house.

812
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,751
It's with the people
rigging the game, us.

813
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,555
You are a deserter
under fire, a traitor!

814
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,313
Shut up. I'll step on you.

815
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:06,111
You can't let him walk out like this.
It disrupts the entire plan!

816
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,551
Got an idea on how to stop him?

817
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,953
- You saved his life!
- I'm trying to save his life!

818
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,428
Sam.

819
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,589
Thank you, Danny.

820
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,749
You don't owe me, Sam. You're entitled
to your opinion. You agree?

821
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,754
What about you, Josh? You got brains.

822
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,710
I got brains, Sam,
but I gotta go with Danny.

823
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,390
It only leaves us one man short.

824
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,275
One man short.
That's nothing, nothing!

825
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,114
Danny, darling, just run a want ad!

826
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,111
We'll have to leave out
one of the casinos.

827
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,197
Hold it. Nobody's walking out.

828
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,154
I'm certainly not gonna
let you boobs...

829
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,597
...pull this job
without your best man.

830
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,912
So go ahead.
When do we blow this mausoleum?

831
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,109
Cuckoo!

832
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,349
Day after tomorrow
we'll be in Las Vegas.

833
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,797
Happy New Year!

834
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,798
Spray the stuff on your shoes?

835
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,237
That infrared paint
isn't ready for the public!

836
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,831
- I can't see a footprint.
- Of course you can. Try this.

837
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,595
Nothing. Danny's off his rocker!

838
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,396
Cool it. Put these on.
Go ahead, put them on.

839
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,153
Now look.

840
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,509
Wow!

841
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:36,029
I got an extra can of this jazz.
Don't be stingy with it, okay?

842
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,669
- Hey.
- What?

843
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:42,829
Mix this with makeup. It would make
for interesting midnights.

844
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,359
I'm hipped.

845
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,516
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four. Three, two...

846
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,948
Come on, kids.

847
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,478
Hup, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four. One...

848
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,280
Hey, kill it.
Go on, Helen. Get in there.

849
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,913
You got a tough job.

850
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,032
Why so many barrels?

851
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,717
When it's à la carte,
then we get sensible garbage.

852
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,435
We'll have none of that.

853
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,678
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hello, Mr. Skelton.

854
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,316
- You remember me?
- I remember what you told me too.

855
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,433
About putting a limit on myself?
Don't take that seriously.

856
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,913
You'd break me like a twig
if I cashed one of your checks.

857
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,318
Don't pay attention to that.
This is all solid flab.

858
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,870
I can't pull a bee's wings.
Cash the check.

859
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,675
No use arguing.
We won't let you exceed your limit.

860
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,152
Unbelievable.
Get a load of this guy.

861
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,632
He acts like we were gonna
stick up the joint. We wouldn't.

862
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,992
- Ridiculous. Cash the check.
- This gentleman is waiting.

863
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,875
Buddy boy, I'm standing
right here like an elm...

864
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,395
...until you cash that check.

865
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,874
You ought to be more careful.
I may win this casino.

866
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,150
The whole joint could be mine.

867
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,796
What cashier's nose would be out
of joint? What's up?

868
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,436
Had to send for Wyatt Earp
and his fat brother.

869
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,629
It's okay.

870
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,474
That's my old slot-machine arm.

871
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,517
Silver dollars, please.

872
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,234
Coffee, please.

873
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,835
Could you light me up, please?

874
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,515
I had the key made.
Be careful with it. Cost two bits.

875
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,832
Somebody should keep an eye
on this spending.

876
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,640
- Here's one for the Sahara.
- Right.

877
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,713
Looks like you're getting
combat fatigue.

878
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,428
You been up on that line a long time.

879
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,834
- Everything all right, Joe?
- Like tulips in July, Mac.

880
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,279
You wanna get a split.

881
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,074
- Come on, Josh.
- I can if you'll cool it.

882
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,993
Be sure you let go of the ball.

883
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,554
- What'd you find out?
- Casinos don't like to be robbed.

884
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,838
That's narrow-minded.
The wire-crossing work?

885
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:38,477
- Technically everything works.
- How long will it take to rig them?

886
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,468
Five casinos, 15 minutes each.
That's 75 minutes.

887
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,429
Traveling time 25 minutes.
An hour and 40 minutes.

888
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,154
That's when I'll rig them.

889
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:54,235
- Can't you preset them so it's ready?
- Can't take the chance.

890
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,235
If the cable fails legitimately,
those doors spring open.

891
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,194
- Did you pick a tower?
- The biggest.

892
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,833
Josh will give you a hand.

893
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,432
What about the Sahara?

894
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,434
One security cop got me bugged.

895
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,639
He sits in the cage. Must
have arthritis. He never moves.

896
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,990
A left hook'll keep him that way.

897
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,269
- Sam?
- As steady as down-country loving.

898
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,833
Good boy.

899
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,478
Louis, the Desert Inn?

900
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,076
It'll be just as easy as riding
a stuffed horse.

901
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,912
- How's that?
- It'll be as...

902
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,395
Forget it.

903
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,234
- Jimmy?
- Flamingo's all set.

904
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,716
What about the Sands?

905
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,039
Smooth and level.

906
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:45,556
Nobody carries
identification until it's done.

907
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,510
Everybody with an inside job, go back.
The rest of us will be outside.

908
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,280
Stand in front of your casinos
till I contact you.

909
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,393
What we gonna do?
We have all today and tomorrow.

910
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,508
Hey, I got an idea.
A therapeutic idea.

911
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,472
Forget it. No, no.

912
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,759
Today and all day tomorrow
we rehearse until H hour.

913
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,589
- Transportation?
- Have no fear, little Josh is here.

914
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,268
- Let's go. Mushy's up.
- You make it.

915
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,835
- I never bowled in my life.
- Fake it.

916
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,473
- Do we have time for a show?
- What about the Sands lounge?

917
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,557
- Good idea.
- That's my lucky spot.

918
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,639
Someone you know?

919
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,718
I recognized somebody
from the profession.

920
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,717
Yours or his? Come on.

921
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:24,836
- Well, well, well.
- What are you doing here?

922
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,395
Same thing you are, cheating.

923
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,200
You've got me wrong.
I'm here on business.

924
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,197
I expect my party any minute.

925
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,874
I'd like to see her.
And I'll bet your wife would too.

926
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,028
You don't understand.
I'm all alone.

927
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,238
- Cross my heart.
- I hope you die.

928
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,230
Take your hands off me,
or I'll call that cop.

929
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,799
Let's not panic.

930
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,235
When you realize how wrong you are...

931
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,232
...use that.

932
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,509
Hello?

933
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:27,635
Mrs. Ocean? This is a friend.
I'm calling from Las Vegas.

934
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:32,159
I think you'd be interested
to learn what your husband...

935
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,269
<i>... is up to in Vegas.</i>

936
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:40,076
I was taught that creatures like you
rattled before they struck.

937
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,032
And I didn't hear a thing.

938
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,959
<i>I did you a favor.</i>
<i>Sorry I disturbed you.</i>

939
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,152
No, Malicious. I'm not disturbed.

940
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,949
When I learn Danny has an enemy
as venomous as you...

941
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,720
...it just makes me love him more.

942
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,430
Call me anytime.
Love to have you waste your money.

943
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,834
Happy burial, dead dog.

944
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,631
- Are you all ready, Pete?
- Just a second.

945
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,632
- What time?
- One minute, 38 seconds past 12.

946
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,393
- It's five after 6.
- Right.

947
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,276
One minute and 38 seconds
past 12:00, big daddy...

948
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,233
...and then happy New Year!

949
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,108
Happy New Year. Come on, let's go.

950
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,229
- Good evening, Mrs. Restes.
- Hello!

951
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,876
- Nice to see you. Happy New Year.
- Same to you.

952
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,039
Las Vegas is like Paris.
You run into people you know.

953
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,038
- And wish you hadn't.
- My sentiments exactly.

954
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,919
Excuse me, honey. I wanna go outside.

955
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,917
I adore running into friends.

956
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:09,430
- It's certainly our pleasure.
- Is Jimmy joining us?

957
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,234
No, he's shivering in Squaw Valley.

958
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,997
- But he's here.
- Here, in Vegas?

959
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,953
At the Flamingo.
I saw him last night.

960
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,033
Don't tell me he broke
something skiing.

961
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,548
Nothing that showed.

962
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,673
Why would he tell me he was
going to Squaw...? I'm stupid.

963
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,436
He ran into some jiggly little
number who was Vegas-bound.

964
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:37,231
Jiggly little number isn't the way
I'd describe Danny Ocean.

965
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,428
He's more like a well-mannered shark.

966
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,229
Twenty-five dollar chips, please.

967
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,077
Tony! It's me, Steffans. Tony!

968
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,758
Are you nuts? Get away!

969
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,349
- Will you make it?
- You'll know.

970
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,835
Okay, I'll see you at the blowoff.

971
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:51,035
He said it was a lady's drink.
I think he meant a lady horse.

972
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,350
He meant one at a time, honey.

973
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,795
Lucky I can hold my liquor.

974
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,560
You can get to the room by yourself?

975
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,274
I got a date in the casino. Your key.

976
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,310
You're wasting your time with
that Clyde, honey. He's a loser.

977
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,434
I'm so drunk I couldn't lie down
without holding on.

978
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,031
Get her out of here!

979
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,590
Here you are, missy.
Happy New Year to you!

980
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,991
I do not know who you are,
my good fellow.

981
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:46,432
Who do I have to be
to wish you a happy New Year?

982
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,838
Ricky Nelson.

983
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,311
I used to be Ricky Nelson.
I'm Perry Como now.

984
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,238
No, you're not. You moved.

985
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,076
Smart girl. About this night air,
let's get in out of it. Come on.

986
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,838
Is it New Year's yet?

987
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,198
Too close for comfort. Come on.

988
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:07,439
I hate it too. I hate
holidays. Do you like holid...?

989
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:10,791
- Give me a kiss. How about it?
- Sound idea.

990
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,436
- I'll be there in a minute.
- I'll wait for you.

991
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,789
You know something?

992
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,391
- I think I kiss better when I'm drunk.
- Some other time.

993
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,709
Where you going?

994
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,629
After all we've meant to each other,
I must leave you.

995
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:41,555
- Hey now. This is a dirty deal!
- Our first quarrel.

996
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,836
I don't fit into your picture?

997
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,640
From here on in you don't, sweetheart.

998
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,950
- Good night.
- Good night.

999
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,756
It's okay, man.

1000
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,232
It's okay. It so happens
I'm very much in demand.

1001
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:03,597
Maestro! Ladies and gentlemen,
it's almost midnight.

1002
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,555
So pucker up your lips, ladies,
20 seconds to go.

1003
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,031
20, 19, 18.

1004
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,516
17, 16, 15...

1005
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,069
...14, 13...

1006
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,670
...12, 11...

1007
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,309
...ten, nine...

1008
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,638
...eight, seven, six, five...

1009
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:36,192
...four, three, two, one.

1010
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,436
Happy New Year!

1011
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,516
Lights! Lights! Darn that cable.

1012
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,597
It's the second time this month.

1013
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,758
The lights will be back on any minute.

1014
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:48,431
<i>Once more, George.</i>
<i>Keep playing until the lights come on.</i>

1015
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,231
Pardon me. Wrong girl.

1016
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,156
Douse those lights.

1017
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,072
Now sing loud and clear.

1018
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,109
Sing louder.

1019
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:31,714
With the music now.
When shouldn't it be forgot?

1020
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,035
Blow out the candle. Blow!

1021
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,352
All right, sing. It's a party.
Loud and clear.

1022
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,437
Do what he says, Charlie.
Trick or treat.

1023
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,835
You too, let's make it a duet.

1024
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,994
A little louder.

1025
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,508
We've been hit.

1026
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,633
- We've been tapped.
- What?

1027
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,757
We've been held up. Robbed.

1028
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,271
The sheriff's office. Hurry!

1029
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,477
<i>- Sheriff Wimmer?</i>
- Sheriff Wimmer speaking.

1030
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:52,832
<i>- Flamingo speaking. We been tapped.</i>
- We'll be right over.

1031
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:57,239
The Flamingo.
Roll cars 620, 622 and 624.

1032
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,755
Roll more.
They knocked over the Sands.

1033
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,632
Happy New Year!

1034
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,195
- How'd it come off?
- Like a charm.

1035
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,913
Same here. Fantastic.

1036
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,272
All cars,
cover all entrances and exits.

1037
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,631
Sands, Sahara, Flamingo,
Desert Inn, Riviera.

1038
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,871
Check everyone who leaves.

1039
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:18,759
Did you get a look at them?
Any kind?

1040
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,075
<i>What? In the dark?</i>

1041
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,919
Did you hear anybody say anything?

1042
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:26,635
<i>- He said we should sing.</i>
- He said you should sing.

1043
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,874
This is Don Murphy speaking for
station KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1044
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,355
We're at the Hotel Riviera.

1045
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,431
You'll hear some reports...

1046
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:41,279
...of this robbery
from eyewitnesses.

1047
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,034
You have something to say?

1048
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:49,311
If you're gonna interview people,
pick elderly couples.

1049
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,670
The others don't
always belong together.

1050
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:59,948
- Don't look now. It's little old me.
- How'd your action go?

1051
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:04,233
- I was ashamed to take the money.
- Good boy. Get lost now.

1052
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:10,234
305 and 309, reinforce roadblocks
extending to Barstow. Acknowledge.

1053
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:14,798
Get a rundown on every train
leaving Vegas, east and west.

1054
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,439
Things went too easy.

1055
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,833
Tony!

1056
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,831
Never the luck, never the luck.

1057
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,035
- Tony!
- Tony!

1058
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,638
Okay, folks, get back. Okay.

1059
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:06,436
- Call for an ambulance, quick.
- Okay, but this guy's dead.

1060
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:14,196
Tony's just another
guy who died in the street.

1061
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,153
- Lot of guys die in the street.
- Sure.

1062
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,237
Happens all the time.

1063
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,837
- No sweat.
- No sweat.

1064
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,638
Yes, I heard you.
Check all outgoing flights.

1065
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,552
Car 306. 306, come in, please.

1066
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,320
I want every piece
of luggage examined.

1067
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,590
306, proceed with plan 22. Over.

1068
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,437
If they don't cooperate,
let's find out why.

1069
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,950
<i>- I can 't do it.</i>
- What do you mean, you can't?

1070
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:44,632
- How'd it go?
- Smooth as a peeled egg. You?

1071
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,593
Things happen that can break you up.

1072
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,030
- Like what?
- Tony's dead.

1073
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:53,391
- Bergdorf?
- Heart attack, crossing the street.

1074
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,751
- Cops got to him.
- They'll check up on him.

1075
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,794
What are they gonna find?
Nothing. Nobody'll ever know.

1076
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,593
Yeah, no one but us.

1077
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:07,632
Don't hit me on the head with that.
I'll tell the other men.

1078
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,872
Then they won't panic.
The plan's the same.

1079
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:14,993
The money stays where it is.
Nobody checks out.

1080
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,033
Go back to your job.
I'll contact you later.

1081
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,313
He's taking it hard.

1082
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,429
Yeah. Long time since he lost
a man in combat.

1083
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:35,790
- Somebody stole millions?
- Yes, but there's still some left.

1084
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,831
Would you move along, please?

1085
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:07,159
The sheriff's office
and the police assured us...

1086
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,079
...we'll have a capture by morning.

1087
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,392
Thank you very much, sir.
And there you have it.

1088
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,276
Millions are missing,
stolen by several men.

1089
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:22,508
But they're being tracked
down as they skulk down dark roads...

1090
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,632
...where the long arm
of the law reaches out.

1091
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,756
- Happy New Year, officer.
- Yeah, say...

1092
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,598
What's going on?

1093
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,155
Will you get this truck out of here?

1094
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,749
I'll be glad to do that there.

1095
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:01,793
Happy New Year!

1096
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,909
Oh, my goodness!

1097
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,508
Danny.

1098
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:38,792
I'll tell you why we're meeting,
but get one point straight.

1099
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,150
We're not the sole owners.

1100
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,272
We have partners we have
to answer to. Right?

1101
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,790
- You can say that again.
- Mine are coming after me.

1102
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,752
Mine are not happy either.

1103
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,520
They gave me a free hand
to make a deal.

1104
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,676
What deal? For what?

1105
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:58,989
To get our money back.
Now, how about it?

1106
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:02,789
- You boys empowered to make a deal?
- I am.

1107
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,549
Good. Duke Santos is coming
in to see us.

1108
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,513
- Duke Santos?
- Just doesn't figure.

1109
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,555
If he pulled a robbery,
he'd have his lawyers do it.

1110
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,557
Yeah, I know the firm.

1111
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,474
- Yes?
<i>- Mr. Santos.</i>

1112
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:24,071
Send him in, please. I don't know
how you fellows feel about it...

1113
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,316
...but I'm glad he's interested.

1114
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,956
- Mr. Santos, my name is Strager.
- Glad to meet you.

1115
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,355
I want you to meet my friends.

1116
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,519
Mr. Brice, Mr. Gillette,
Mr. Freeman, Mr. McCoy.

1117
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,429
- Hi.
- Won't you sit down?

1118
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:52,835
We were just saying how happy
we are to get your call.

1119
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,792
I'll get your money back.

1120
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,993
Mr. Santos doesn't make
a promise he can't keep.

1121
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,873
- No doubt about it.
- First time I relaxed.

1122
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,279
How much is it going to cost us?

1123
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:08,634
Let's say I wanted a third and...

1124
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,153
...you fellows beat me down
to 30 percent.

1125
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:14,469
Okay?

1126
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,754
And if he doesn't deliver
he gets nothing.

1127
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,793
- Naturally.
- I'll certainly go for that.

1128
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,798
Our insurance won't
even pay 20 percent.

1129
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,197
Neither will ours.
But that's a big finder's fee.

1130
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:32,359
That all depends on what
the finder's looking for.

1131
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,395
Okay, I'll go along.

1132
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,079
- Me too.
- So will I.

1133
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:41,108
All right, but how about taking
some of it in chips?

1134
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,630
We would like a chance to win it back.

1135
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,358
Would you now?

1136
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,156
Okay, you got it.

1137
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,349
For 30 percent of what they
took out, heads or tails.

1138
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:02,758
No, thanks, Mr. Santos.
I got partners. They wouldn't...

1139
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,872
...want me to make a bet like that.

1140
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,799
So what do you do?

1141
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,151
- Shut up. And that's what I'm doing.
- Good.

1142
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,790
I'll expect the cooperation
of the local sheriff.

1143
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,038
- You'll arrange it for me?
- Consider it done.

1144
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,673
Mr. Santos...

1145
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,116
...may I ask a question?
- Lf it's the right one.

1146
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:29,397
You're not getting involved
for the dough.

1147
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,238
What's your real reason?

1148
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,117
Well, frankly,
whoever pulled this job...

1149
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:39,791
...shouldn't have done it while I was
in town. It's embarrassing.

1150
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,754
- Call the sheriff for me?
- It'll be taken care of.

1151
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,199
The report on Bergdorf.

1152
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,392
- Who?
- The dead man we brought in.

1153
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:59,029
The guy got a Purple Heart.

1154
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,549
Sheriff, Mr. Strager on three.

1155
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,757
- Yes?
<i>- We made a deal with Duke Santos...</i>

1156
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,554
- Duke Santos!
<i>- We get our money back.</i>

1157
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,548
- I'm pleased for you.
<i>- He's at the Riviera. Talk to him.</i>

1158
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,399
Sure. Of course, I'll talk to him.

1159
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:22,636
Locate the wife.
Pump her. She may know something.

1160
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:25,354
I'll be at the Riviera
with Mr. Santos.

1161
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:28,950
- Call me if you find out anything.
- Okay, skipper.

1162
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,558
Come in.

1163
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,196
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Ritsik doesn 't answer.</i>

1164
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,436
Joe Ritsik don't answer?

1165
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:50,399
Operator, honey,
you're wasting my time.

1166
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,353
Don't wanna know about
guys who don't answer.

1167
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,071
Try the Terre Haute card.
Manny Ruditski or Willy Henshaw.

1168
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,312
He's listed.
So is Fred Cusik in Palm Beach.

1169
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,351
- Try them all.
<i>- I'll do my best.</i>

1170
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:06,358
Thattagirl. Get me some
numbers that answer.

1171
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,952
Mr. Santos, Sheriff Wimmer.

1172
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:13,550
Nice of you to drop by so soon,
sheriff. Sit down.

1173
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:17,150
I guess you understand my position,
Mr. Santos.

1174
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:21,399
We're grateful for your work.
But don't cut out on your own.

1175
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,593
Whatever I get goes straight to you.
What's new on your end?

1176
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:29,349
We had a net over the highway
minutes after the alarm.

1177
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:32,074
They got out only by seconds.

1178
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:35,989
So it don't count?
They get disqualified?

1179
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,791
Shows they're a professional outfit.

1180
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,156
- Is there another kind?
- Look...

1181
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,158
Sheriff, don't get
your feathers ruffled.

1182
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,358
Your sources can check any outfit?

1183
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,437
You bet your boots they can!

1184
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,193
- Hello?
<i>- This is Manny.</i>

1185
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,995
- Manny. What'd you hear?
<i>- Nothing, not even a smell.</i>

1186
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:02,351
Nothing? Not a smell?

1187
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:07,438
What's this? You keep nosing around
till you do get a smell.

1188
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:17,751
You know how it is.
You gotta give it a little time.

1189
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,352
- Hello.
<i>- Sheriff Wimmer.</i>

1190
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,870
- Just a second. It's for you, sheriff.
- Thanks.

1191
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,473
- Hello.
<i>- This is Joe.</i>

1192
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,359
<i>- I talked to his wife.</i>
- Does she know anything?

1193
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:34,156
<i>- She hasn 't seen him.</i>
- The whole time he was in prison?

1194
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:37,472
- She's claiming the body?
<i>- To take it to...</i>

1195
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,635
She can take it to San Francisco.

1196
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:44,719
Turn him over to Cohen's Mortuary.
They'll ship him out.

1197
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:49,555
- What was that about?
- Guy died last night in front.

1198
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:54,550
Quite a hero. Purple Heart.
Served with the 82nd Airborne.

1199
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:56,913
The 82nd Airborne?

1200
01:42:57,120 --> 01:43:01,318
Yeah, served in San Quentin too.
I gotta get back.

1201
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,590
So long, Mr. Santos. Keep in touch.

1202
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,077
And is it vice versa, sheriff?

1203
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,788
We understand each other, certainly.

1204
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,958
So long, sheriff.
You'll hear from me.

1205
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,116
- Hello.
<i>- Mr. Henshaw is expected.</i>

1206
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,794
Never mind, operator.
I'll call him later.

1207
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,953
And don't make any more
calls for about an hour.

1208
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:32,595
Mr. Cohen?

1209
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:36,993
I'm Mr. Kelly. My Cohen
is my associate. He's occupied.

1210
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:41,990
- May I be of some service?
- The sheriff sent over a body?

1211
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:47,399
Yes, a Mr. Bergdorf. Must've been
a fine-Iooking fellow in life.

1212
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,875
With the compliments of Mr. Strager.

1213
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,992
I'm helping to investigate
last night's robbery.

1214
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,997
A shocking thing.

1215
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:00,631
If somebody shows an interest
you should call me right away.

1216
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:03,195
I'm Duke Santos. I'm at the Riviera.

1217
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,557
You can tell Mr. Strager
he can depend on us.

1218
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:10,719
He said he could, yeah.
And, Mr. Kelly, please...

1219
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,349
...not a word about this to anyone?

1220
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,117
Not even to Mr. Cohen.

1221
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:22,516
A job this big,
and nobody knows who did it?

1222
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:25,188
<i>We're digging, but so far, nothing.</i>

1223
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,749
- There ain't a single break?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

1224
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,831
Okay, Fred. Keep listening.

1225
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,276
- Hi, honey.
- Hello, darling.

1226
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:41,759
Excuse me, but this is
the first opportunity I've had.

1227
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,633
Operator, the Flamingo, please.

1228
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:51,190
I had a date with Adele.
You must be starved.

1229
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,960
I got other problems.
I can't have lunch.

1230
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,639
I asked friends to join us.

1231
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,197
You won't be Ionesome.
Make it quick. I got calls coming.

1232
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:04,949
Flamingo? I'd like to speak
to Mr. James Foster.

1233
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:06,515
Who did you say?

1234
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:10,030
Jimmy's there.
He didn't go to Squaw Valley.

1235
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:14,153
Operator, if his room doesn't answer,
have him paged.

1236
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:18,029
Wouldn't you think he'd call?
He knows very well I'm here.

1237
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:20,708
Wait'll he hits the crap tables.

1238
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:23,753
He only thinks of me
when he needs something.

1239
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:27,589
What does he see in Danny Ocean
and those Army cronies?

1240
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,597
They always hold meetings.

1241
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:32,268
<i>- I'm paging him.</i>
- Yes, I'll wait.

1242
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,268
They're meeting? Why'd he say
he's going to Squaw Valley?

1243
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:39,677
Adele told me he was here.
Ocean is with him.

1244
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,474
Heaven knows how many
other ex-Army pals.

1245
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:47,430
Foster, Ocean and Bergdorf.
All 82nd Airborne.

1246
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:52,350
Maybe it's the anniversary
of one of their commando raids.

1247
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:57,196
The Little Scorpions.
It's all very mysterious.

1248
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,350
What are you doing?

1249
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,552
It ain't mysterious.
Hello, operator.

1250
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,673
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>
- Cancel all the calls I put in.

1251
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,959
No wonder I couldn't find out nothing.
A work of art.

1252
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,799
- What are you so excited about?
- This.

1253
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,712
- The robbery?
- Yeah.

1254
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:22,268
You had anything to do with this?

1255
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:25,711
No, I'm clean. But I know
who pulled that job.

1256
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,114
- You do?
- Yeah.

1257
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:30,153
- Shouldn't you tell the police?
- Oh, no!

1258
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:34,148
You wanna know why not?
Because I love you too much.

1259
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,357
May I learn what's so amusing?

1260
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,118
Your Jimmy, your innocent.

1261
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:44,430
- I knew he had guts when I met him.
- Please, Duke.

1262
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:48,474
This job was cooked up by Jimmy
and his soldier pals.

1263
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:53,316
Jimmy has all the money he could
spend. Why would he rob anyone?

1264
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,954
Hitler had Europe.
Why'd he want Russia?

1265
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:59,715
You can't compare Jimmy with him.
He fought Hitler.

1266
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,354
He and his paratroopers
overran Germany.

1267
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,836
Last night they overrun Las Vegas.

1268
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,115
It's a shame that boy
wasn't born poor.

1269
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:12,596
- What a career he could've had.
- You're serious.

1270
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,028
They hijacked the town.

1271
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:17,277
Jimmy and his paratroopers.
This won't take long.

1272
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,874
See you at lunch.

1273
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:23,159
- Want some lunch?
- Go ahead. I may not eat for weeks.

1274
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:33,752
Hello, Danny.
Hey, nice room you got here.

1275
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,478
- I don't know your friend.
- You don't know me.

1276
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:41,672
Sure I do.
I'm a pal of Jimmy Foster's.

1277
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,275
I know some of your other buddies too.

1278
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:48,149
Like Tony Bergdorf.

1279
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,551
Poor Tony died, you know.

1280
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,998
It's too bad. His wife's coming over
to claim his body.

1281
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:58,357
Yeah, Tony's going home in a pine box.

1282
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:03,959
It's a beautiful job you boys pulled.
A real work of art.

1283
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:09,155
- You a cop?
- Me? Duke Santos, a cop?

1284
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:15,118
I only wish I was in on it with you.
I envy you, your youth.

1285
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:19,630
You're not getting younger.
What do you want?

1286
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,798
Pros, I would've put out of business.

1287
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:27,950
But new talent needs encouraging.
I want half.

1288
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,958
- Half of what?
- You tell me. You got the money.

1289
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,630
You're talking to a dead phone.

1290
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,798
There's a live one
at the sheriff's office.

1291
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,149
So you are a cop?

1292
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:46,956
I made a deal with the casino owners
to get their money back.

1293
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,356
You're ready to double-cross them?

1294
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,758
They were only gonna pay me
30 percent. You'll give me 50.

1295
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,475
- Playing both ends from the middle.
- I can't lose.

1296
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:02,679
You've already lost.
The money's sent out of town.

1297
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,348
If you're here, the money's here.

1298
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,757
We couldn't make a deal with you.

1299
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,554
- Too many people involved.
- Talk to them.

1300
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:16,556
That's gonna take a little time.

1301
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,395
I'll give you till tomorrow.

1302
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:23,160
I know you won't try anything cute.

1303
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,710
50 percent is better
than 100 of nothing.

1304
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:29,150
One o'clock tomorrow, here.

1305
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,159
Bye-bye.

1306
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:34,989
Hold it.

1307
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:40,910
What's your relationship to Jimmy?

1308
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:44,156
I'm gonna marry his mama.

1309
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:51,352
Jimmy sold us out.
Your best friend sold us out.

1310
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:54,589
You believe that?

1311
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,030
Want the facts tattooed on your nose?

1312
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:00,556
Now we found out he's turned canary...

1313
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,990
...you gotta stand up for the slob.

1314
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:06,630
- Always on the opposite side.
- You jump to conclusions.

1315
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:09,274
What will the others jump to?

1316
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,239
Does Jimmy
know where we hid the money?

1317
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:15,079
- He does.
- Why doesn't he tell Santos...

1318
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,874
...pick it up
and split it with him?

1319
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:24,790
- Go ahead. Right on the chin.
- Forget about it.

1320
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,714
I've been making mistakes myself.

1321
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:32,670
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy!

1322
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:38,198
I came as quickly as I could.
Are you ill?

1323
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,868
You fool! You complete utter ass!

1324
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:44,117
- Good, you're not ill.
- I could slap you.

1325
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,038
Mother's Day? Did I forget?

1326
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:50,597
You dare to be sarcastic after what
you've done? No, it's not.

1327
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:55,072
How do you plan to celebrate
Mother's Day? Rob Fort Knox?

1328
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:59,996
After stealing all the money
in Las Vegas, that's the next step.

1329
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:05,399
Amazed? You probably thought
you'd committed the perfect crime.

1330
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:09,395
- You moron, I could die.
- Who's been talking to you?

1331
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,751
- Duke, he knows all about it.
- That's impossible!

1332
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:18,469
- Why would you believe what he says?
- Because he's a professional.

1333
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:21,399
Don't try to lie.
Your face gives you away.

1334
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,876
- As a liar, you're an amateur.
- Where's Santos?

1335
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:28,356
He's going to take the money
away from them.

1336
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:31,478
Now he's gonna get mixed up
in this too.

1337
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,356
Oh, Jimmy, how could you
treat me this way?

1338
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,709
Now's a nice time to tell him.

1339
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:59,158
I apologize. I thought
you blew the whistle on us.

1340
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:02,551
But Clarence Darrow here,
he proved otherwise.

1341
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,559
What do we do now that Santos knows?

1342
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:11,273
Wish I knew.
We haven't got much time left.

1343
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:13,914
I got an idea.

1344
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:22,952
I'll paint you a picture on
the way out. Come on, Clarence.

1345
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,359
What's so funny?

1346
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:47,358
I knew this color would come in handy.

1347
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:49,998
- Oh, Josh.
- Yeah?

1348
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:53,556
- How do you get this stuff off?
- What I usually...

1349
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:02,915
You can count it in San Francisco.

1350
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:06,032
It's for Tony's widow.
It's only 10 grand.

1351
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:09,038
Good boy. I should've
thought of that myself.

1352
01:54:56,080 --> 01:55:00,198
- Operation Pine Box.
- Danny? The widow just arrived.

1353
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:03,633
I figure she'll ship the body
on the 11:40.

1354
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,752
It's the only train today.
They got time.

1355
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,554
You stay with her.
We'll phone the others.

1356
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:17,310
<i>- Operator?</i>
- Operator, get me Dudley 26969.

1357
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:30,557
<i>- Vince Massler.</i>
- Vince, watch the 11:40.

1358
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:32,273
Tony may go out on it.

1359
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,558
Mr. Santos will get his.

1360
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,875
Sorry to keep you. I'm Mr. Cohen.

1361
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:46,437
I came to make arrangements
to ship my husband's body.

1362
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:48,915
Yes. Mrs. Bergdorf, may l...?

1363
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:53,593
May I ask, Mrs. Bergdorf,
in my professional capacity...

1364
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:56,075
...are you a woman of means?

1365
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,353
Oh, no.

1366
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:03,039
No, my late husband left me $ 10,000.

1367
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:05,598
I received it this morning.

1368
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:09,556
I'd like to keep that
for my son's education.

1369
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,159
I understand.

1370
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:14,594
If I may make a suggestion,
Mrs. Bergdorf?

1371
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,835
Of course.

1372
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:20,352
The services in Las Vegas are
no different from San Francisco.

1373
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:24,912
Your husband was a war hero.
And we have the American Legion here.

1374
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:29,159
The legionnaires will be happy
to serve as pallbearers.

1375
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:33,154
Why waste money
on needless transportation?

1376
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:37,195
- I guess you're right, Mr. Cohen.
- Good. Good.

1377
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,794
<i>- Danny?</i>
- Corneal?

1378
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,992
<i>Something's going on,</i>
<i>but I don 't know what.</i>

1379
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:09,516
- The box hasn't left?
- I don't think it's going to.

1380
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:12,757
<i>- Why not?</i>
- A bunch of legionnaires showed up.

1381
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,916
They're gonna attend the services.

1382
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:17,793
The widow's gonna plant Tony here
in Vegas.

1383
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,436
Wait there. I'll round up the boys.
We'll be over.

1384
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:14,511
- Who is it?
- Kelly of Kelly and Cohen Morticians.

1385
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:19,350
You asked me to call you
if something unusual happened.

1386
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:21,398
Bergdorf? Yeah, go ahead.

1387
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:25,275
A dozen men arrived
to attend the services...

1388
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:29,991
...held in our chapel which
serves all denominations and faiths.

1389
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:31,997
Skip the commercial, will you?

1390
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,794
These men don't look like
usual mourners.

1391
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,238
<i>There's something else.</i>

1392
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,479
<i>I made an unusual discovery</i>
<i>in the waiting chapel.</i>

1393
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,318
I could call it incredible.

1394
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:47,157
Mr. Santos, I will call it incredible.

1395
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:52,520
- What is it?
<i>- A money band. A $ 10,000 money band.</i>

1396
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:56,110
Lying by the coffin.
It wasn't there last night.

1397
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,634
- By the coffin?
- Right beside it.

1398
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:02,354
I hardly know what to think.

1399
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,355
I do. I'll be right over.

1400
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:08,996
How do you like that?
A dead delivery boy!

1401
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:13,232
We are gathered together today
to pay tribute...

1402
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:17,229
...to the memory of
Anthony Raymond Bergdorf.

1403
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:22,554
At such a time it is fitting
that we recall the psalm of David.

1404
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:26,318
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1405
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:30,478
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1406
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,913
He leadeth me besides still waters.

1407
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:37,079
He restoreth my soul.

1408
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:41,757
He guideth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1409
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:46,235
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

1410
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:49,796
...I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

1411
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:53,274
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

1412
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:58,199
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

1413
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:04,195
Thou anointest my head with oil;
my cup runneth over.

1414
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:07,477
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all..."

1415
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:10,951
- What's that noise?
- What's that noise?

1416
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:13,196
"...the Lord forever."

1417
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:15,158
What's that noise?

1418
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:18,631
The deceased is being cremated.

1419
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:24,230
"Verily, verily, the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

1420
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,472
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

1421
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:30,351
...dust to dust.

1422
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:36,188
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection unto eternal life.

1423
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:38,908
The Lord lift up His face upon you...

1424
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:40,678
...and give you peace.

1425
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,150
This day and always.

1426
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:44,589
Amen."
