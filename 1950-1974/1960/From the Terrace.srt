1
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:08,424
- Weinkoop, where is she?
- In this car, sir.

2
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:10,576
- Has she recovered consciousness?
- Not yet.

3
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:13,498
- This is the company doctor.
- Follow me. - Come on.

4
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:24,336
Five minutes out of Port Johnson
she went into the ladies' room.

5
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:27,542
- Must've finished off a pint.
- The telegram said she fell.

6
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:30,856
Rolled off the seat
like a sack of flour.

7
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:38,182
- Well?
- She's dead drunk.

8
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:42,702
My report can say something else,
but that's what it is.

9
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:44,662
Belongs in a hospital.

10
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:47,897
Anything to get her
off company property. Come on, Doc.

11
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:54,781
Have her taken to the Jefferson
Hospital. You go with her.

12
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:57,982
Be sure you make it straight
we're not taking any responsibility.

13
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,864
We're doing this only
as a courtesy to her husband.

14
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:03,255
Put her in a private room
under another name.

15
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:06,815
Keep her there until I get
Sam Eaton to come take her home.

16
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,338
Very well, Mr Jones.

17
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:12,817
There's more to running a railroad
than just laying down some tracks.

18
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:16,500
- Looking for quail, Frolick,
as usual? - As usual.

19
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:19,742
You won't find any around here.
They're all down on Market Street.

20
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,863
- Nobody left on that train?
- No, just the crew.

21
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:25,697
I wonder if...

22
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:29,500
Oh, no. Not Martha Eaton.

23
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,658
See you later.

24
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:38,022
This is DD Jones.

25
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,416
I want you to put in a long-distance
call to Port Johnson.

26
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:43,337
To Mr Samuel Eaton.

27
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:46,379
That's right, Eaton Iron and Steel.

28
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:49,537
Will you be home for dinner,
Mr Eaton, if anyone should ask?

29
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:53,141
If you mean by "anyone" Mrs Eaton,
say so, Nellie...

30
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:55,023
or forever hold your peace.

31
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:58,222
Well, what with Mr. Alfred
coming home from the war today.

32
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,137
You're sure it's today, are you?

33
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:03,581
Maybe you even know what time
he's coming. Or how he's coming.

34
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:07,260
No reason a servant shouldn't know
more than his own family.

35
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:10,019
Those eggs were too hard
again today, Nellie.

36
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:14,144
- When I say soft-boiled,
I mean soft-boiled. - Yes, Mr Eaton.

37
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,739
I may be home. Then again, I may not.

38
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:19,977
- And now I'm off. Goodbye, Nellie.
- Goodbye, sir.

39
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:35,064
Hello. Eaton residence.

40
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,900
Oh, I'm sorry. He just left.

41
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:43,819
You should be able to reach him
at the mill in about 10 minutes.

42
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:45,657
You're welcome. Goodbye.

43
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:50,338
Mrs Eaton got out of the house
mighty early this morning, George.

44
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:53,815
- Yes, sir.
- Philadelphia again?

45
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:57,261
I didn't wait to see
which train she took, sir.

46
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:58,824
Didn't she say anything?

47
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:01,016
We were too busy
talking about your boy

48
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:04,939
coming home safe from the navy
to talk about unimportant matters.

49
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,665
In other words, Mrs Eaton's
whereabouts are too unimportant

50
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:09,816
for me to have any interest in them.

51
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:13,819
There's nothing about Mrs Eaton
that's unimportant. Not to me, sir.

52
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:16,579
Are you trying to say something
to me, George?

53
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:20,897
Well, sir, I made me a promise
the day your son went away.

54
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:22,737
"George Fry", I said,

55
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:25,301
'The day Alfred comes
home from this war,

56
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:28,582
you'll say some things
that's been wanting to be said."

57
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:30,901
Took a lot for granted, didn't you?

58
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,738
I knew he was coming back.
I prayed for him.

59
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:38,581
Prayed? You're no more
of a praying man than I am.

60
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:41,259
If it was Billy gone to war
instead of Alfred,

61
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,814
maybe you'd have learned
to pray, Mr Eaton.

62
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,579
Is that what you promised
yourself to say?

63
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:49,862
A father can feel badly
over a son dead 13 years

64
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:53,142
without ignoring the other one.
- Don't preach to me, George.

65
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:57,939
- No, sir. - Maybe you'd better
be taking the day off.

66
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,221
I'll accept the day's holiday, sir,

67
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:03,661
but after that,
I don't want to work for you anymore.

68
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:05,656
No, I shouldn't think you would.

69
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:10,296
- I'll have your check ready for you
tomorrow morning. - Yes, sir.

70
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,773
You might as well stop
in front of the saloon,

71
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:15,663
when we get there and get out.

72
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:18,134
That's where you'll be going anyway,
I'm sure.

73
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:28,025
Here's to Samuel Eaton,
president of Eaton Iron and Steel,

74
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:31,575
who, after 20-some odd years
of being dirty,

75
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:36,023
rotten mean to his boy Alfred
has just been fired.

76
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:38,785
I said fired, Noony,
by his own chauffeur.

77
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,061
I'll drink to that.

78
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,185
And here's to Alfred Eaton,

79
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:49,223
who never did anything wrong
in his whole life,

80
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,661
except be the son
who didn't die of spinal meningitis,

81
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:54,543
when he was a kid.

82
00:06:57,505 --> 00:07:02,625
And now I hope he'll be forgiven
for living through the war.

83
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:45,535
You know where North Hill Road is?

84
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:50,699
- Hey, Jake. Got a passenger
for out of town. - Good.

85
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:10,261
- Don't you want to help me
with my bags? - Who says so?

86
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:18,097
- How much do I owe you?
- 3 dollars.

87
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:23,893
- Oh, yeah? Who says so?
- I said so. 3 dollars.

88
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:32,535
- Wait here while I go in
and telephone. - Telephone who?

89
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:35,458
The taxi company to find out
when they raised their prices.

90
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,220
- 2 dollars.
- Here's one dollar.

91
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:42,178
Now, beat it before
I pull you out of that cab

92
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:45,337
and bust your nose for you.
- Well, big man.

93
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:57,418
Mr. Alfred.

94
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,581
Hello, Josephine.
Hello, Nellie.

95
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:02,737
- Stop, Nellie, for the Lord's sake.
- I can't help it.

96
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:05,863
Well, you all look fine.

97
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:09,381
- Come on, now.
Turn around, Josephine. - I will not.

98
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:12,059
You don't have to.
I can see it's getting bigger.

99
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:14,693
- It is not.
- She don't have her corset on.

100
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:16,821
Shut your mouth, for the Lord's sake.

101
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:23,263
I brought you two old crows
some presents from London.

102
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:25,734
You didn't have to spend
your money on us.

103
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:29,345
- We're just thankful you're home.
- I'll bet you are, too.

104
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:42,175
You didn't tell a soul
what time you were coming.

105
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:46,062
I didn't want to give anybody
a chance not to meet me.

106
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:48,017
We aren't really ready for you

107
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:50,779
what with the mister
and missis away. - Away?

108
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:56,144
Tonight I have only lamb chops,
but I did make apple pie.

109
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:58,458
Where did they go?

110
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,617
The missis went away this morning.
I don't know where.

111
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:05,255
The mister called this afternoon.
It sounded like long distance.

112
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:09,782
He said, "Don't wait with dinner."
We fixed for Miss Trimingham early.

113
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:10,980
Miss Trimingham?

114
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:14,296
Yes. Come on, Josephine.
Help me with these bags.

115
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:19,016
You'll find your old room,
just exactly the way you left it.

116
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,779
Nellie, who's Miss Trimingham?

117
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:27,700
- She's your mother's trained nurse.
- Trained nurse?

118
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,661
For the drinking, Mr. Alfred.

119
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,223
Alfred.

120
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:31,460
Oh, my Alfred!

121
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:35,823
Mother, you all right?

122
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:39,982
Oh, forgive me. How horrible.

123
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:44,022
I'm so excited and awkward.

124
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:47,780
- Oh, but you're home.
- Yes, Mother.

125
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:51,338
Oh, darling, don't. Don't look at me.

126
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:54,260
I didn't want you to see me
like this.

127
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:58,418
I'm so tired,
and I'm not feeling well.

128
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:03,537
Couldn't we save everything for
tomorrow, when I'll be at my best?

129
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:05,855
We'll make believe
there was no tonight

130
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,697
and that you came home tomorrow

131
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:11,983
and we'll say all our hellos
as they should be. - Sure, Mother.

132
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:16,781
Here comes your father.
Now make allowances.

133
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,505
He's not at his best.

134
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:24,060
Here we are, Sam,
and look who's with me.

135
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:27,783
- My boy. Home at last.
- Hello, Father.

136
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:31,096
Hello, Father?
Is that all after all this time?

137
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:35,497
- No. There's a lot more.
- Yes, I should think there would be.

138
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:40,256
- Now what've you done to yourself?
- She just tripped and fell.

139
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:44,862
- Doesn't he look wonderful?
- Yes. Let's get in the house.

140
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:50,300
Now, Sam, what we've decided is

141
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,535
we're not going to
say our hellos tonight.

142
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,696
We're all much too tired

143
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:57,663
and tomorrow
we'll all be fresh as a daisy.

144
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:59,417
How was the war?

145
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:02,940
OK, I guess. We won it.

146
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:09,857
Oh, have you met my son?

147
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,095
Alfred, this is Miss Trimingham.

148
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:14,381
- How do you do?
- Welcome home.

149
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:16,662
Up we go.

150
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,375
Cool sheets and heavenly rest.

151
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:26,214
Good night, Alfred.
Sleep as late as you like

152
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:29,821
and remember,
you're coming home tomorrow.

153
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:33,295
Tonight never even happened.

154
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:43,942
The house looks good.

155
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:48,656
Yeah. Your mother touched it up
a bit here and there.

156
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:55,100
- You've put on a couple ofpounds.
- Soft living in the navy.

157
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:58,022
I suppose you're sleepy.

158
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:00,699
I was up at quarter to 6:oo
this morning.

159
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:04,699
- Not a very good time to talk now
anyway, is it?

160
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:06,617
No, I guess it isn't.

161
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:12,019
I guess I'll go upstairs, too.
If it's all right with you.

162
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:16,337
- Father?
- Yeah?

163
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:22,376
Nothing. Good night.

164
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,583
Good night.

165
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:40,340
She doesn't need you now.

166
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:49,214
Well, Mr. Alfred,
how does it feel to be home again

167
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,655
and seeing your mother and father?

168
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:55,818
Things don't change, Nellie.
They just get more so.

169
00:14:55,985 --> 00:15:00,058
We got ginger ale, seltzer,
and no liquor. Where's the liquor?

170
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:02,455
Your father keeps it
under lock and key.

171
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:05,864
- Good night, Mr. Alfred.
- Good night.

172
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:10,823
Even the servants in your own house,
know about you.

173
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:15,263
I'm tired. I'm sick. Leave me alone.

174
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:18,775
I'll leave you alone
when you tell
me everything I want to know.

175
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:22,733
- Who else saw you together?
- Nobody else. Not a soul.

176
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:25,817
- You were in restaurants together.
- Never.

177
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,936
Wallowing in filth together!

178
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:31,984
- And I want to know where
every damn place! - No.

179
00:15:32,145 --> 00:15:37,344
- Well, you're going to tell me.
- Oh no, Sam, not tonight. Please.

180
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:43,102
- Where else did you meet him?
- Nowhere else. Only his house.

181
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:46,302
You're lying to me.
You were with him in a hotel room.

182
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:49,855
All right. But only once.

183
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,744
You could stay with him
and me the same night?

184
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:58,020
Yes!

185
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,104
Did you think you're any better,

186
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:06,382
than one of those sluts
on River Street?

187
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:08,900
I'm not proud of myself.

188
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:11,943
Not proud of herself, she says.

189
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:16,621
- How can you look at your own son?
- I can't.

190
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,741
If that egotistical little
father of yours

191
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:20,736
was alive to know about this...

192
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:22,577
Yourson.

193
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:24,576
Your father.

194
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:26,940
Your heroes.

195
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:31,974
I have no heroes,
only some people I love.

196
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:34,215
- You were my hero.
- Shut up!

197
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:36,580
And you drove me to it.

198
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:40,181
You turned your back on me
just like you did on Alfred.

199
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:44,258
I needed love
wherever I could find it.

200
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:46,461
Love!

201
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:49,102
You're a pig.

202
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:51,904
I can't stand the sight of you.

203
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:58,178
Mr Eaton.

204
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:06,775
His name is Charles Frolick.

205
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:11,223
- He's a terrible, evil man.
- How long has it been going on?

206
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:13,256
About a year.

207
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,174
She's been trying not to see him,
but he won't let her.

208
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:19,336
She can't help herself.

209
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,104
Frolick?

210
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:26,978
Number 22 Walnut Street,
Philadelphia.

211
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:38,464
- Yes, what is it?
- Are you Charles Frolick?

212
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,583
I am. What kind
of an hour of the night...

213
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:44,498
- Who the devil are you?
- Charlie.

214
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:46,935
What do you think
you're doing here?

215
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:48,500
Charlie!

216
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:56,977
My name is Alfred Eaton.

217
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:59,136
Alfred Eaton. You got that?

218
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:02,377
Now, you go near my mother
again, I'll kill you.

219
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:07,175
Charlie? What's the big idea
ofkeeping me...

220
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:09,017
Charlie!

221
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:20,860
- Mr. Alfred down yet?
- He's having breakfast, sir.

222
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:25,815
There you are, boy.

223
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:31,737
- Watch those eggs, Nellie.
- Yes, Mr Eaton.

224
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:38,417
Well, how did it feel
sleeping in your own bed?

225
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,941
You mother wanted to buy
a new mattress, but I said no.

226
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:44,141
I slept very well.
Thank you.

227
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:47,854
Well, I didn't. It's not as easy
as it used to be.

228
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:51,943
Still, I guess I'm all right
for a man of 57,

229
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:54,903
considering the way I worked
my tail off during the war.

230
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:58,863
I might even get a chance to rest.

231
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:01,175
We all are, in our business.

232
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:03,415
Big contracts canceled months ago

233
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:06,304
and now those darn fool workers
are going to strike.

234
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:09,502
Let them. There'll be nothing,
but gas in their kids' bellies

235
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,257
by the time they come back.

236
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:14,383
Pay them exactly what you want.
What do you care?

237
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:19,141
I care because I'm against
anybody going on strike against me.

238
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:24,218
You'll know what I feel, when
you come into the business with me.

239
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:36,773
- Well, I suppose you're thinking
of taking it easy. - Not exactly.

240
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:39,220
Maybe traveling a bit,
seeing something of the country

241
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:41,341
before settling down here.

242
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:44,941
We got to start thinking
of a club in Philadelphia for you.

243
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:47,380
I doubt I'll be joining a club,

244
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,582
but if I do,
it'll probably be in New York.

245
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,937
New York? What for?

246
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:58,784
I expect to be spending
some time there.

247
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:00,663
I thought you were going to travel.

248
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,100
You said I was going to travel.
I didn't.

249
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:05,301
My home base will be in New York.

250
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,218
- The hell it will.
- The hell it won't!

251
00:20:12,785 --> 00:20:15,458
I guess I don't feel
like having any breakfast.

252
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:19,300
Tell them in the kitchen
I'm not staying.

253
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:22,454
Don't you want to hear
what my plans are?

254
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,297
I'm in no hurry to.

255
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:29,016
I can see you won't do what I'd hoped
and you haven't discussed it with me.

256
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:30,777
I'd be glad to discuss it.

257
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:35,461
You want to tell me to go to
the devil and take the mill with me.

258
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,856
You've been wanting
to do that all your life.

259
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:42,017
All I wanted to do
is to be friends with you.

260
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:44,858
That's what you want, friendship?

261
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:48,301
I haven't got a friend
for every 10 years I've lived.

262
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:51,218
I hoped for that, too.
First, you'll have to show me

263
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,216
you're a man
I'd want to be friends with.

264
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,945
The job at the mill was yours.

265
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:58,335
I hoped the friendship
would come out of that.

266
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:02,657
Would come out of what,
being your errand boy?

267
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,464
You never asked me
what I wanted to do.

268
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,697
Now I'm supposed to go
into the mill to please you.

269
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:10,617
You'd cripple me for life.

270
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:12,901
You don't think
I can make it on my own.

271
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,784
You're not big enough
to even walk in my shadow

272
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:17,901
and you never will be.

273
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:38,824
Alfred.

274
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:10,901
So much shouting so early in the day
with the servants around, too.

275
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:14,580
I guess we're not
a very respectable family, are we?

276
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:20,616
- You must give him time.
- For what? He'll never change.

277
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:23,936
He might get used to your ways.

278
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:27,142
I don't think I have that much time.
Neither has he.

279
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:31,503
There's a lot of sadness
and sweetness in you, Alfred,

280
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:35,419
but you can be very cruel
and cold sometimes.

281
00:22:40,265 --> 00:22:42,825
Oh nice, kind Alfred.

282
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:45,660
Did I just say something awful?

283
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:49,218
- I'm sorry.
- Nothing for you to be sorry about.

284
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:53,378
Yes, I did.
What's happened to me?

285
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:55,621
I used to be nice

286
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:58,658
and I don't even remember
what made me change.

287
00:22:58,865 --> 00:23:02,175
Don't be hard on yourself.

288
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,093
I know a lot more
than you think I do.

289
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:09,654
You're still my mother.

290
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:11,895
What do you know?

291
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:14,784
Everything.

292
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:19,101
Oh, God.

293
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,653
Put your arms around me, Alfred.

294
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:33,341
- Do you still like me a little?
- I love you, Mother.

295
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:36,262
Even when I'm like this?

296
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:57,141
- You're leaving us,
aren't you, Alfred? - Yes.

297
00:23:58,225 --> 00:24:00,102
Where are you going?

298
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:03,302
I may stay with Lex Porter
in New York for a while.

299
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:05,421
I suppose you'll see the Thorntons.

300
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:08,816
Fritz Thornton is throwing a party
for Lex tonight in Southampton.

301
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:13,137
The Porters and the Thorntons
are like a second family to you,

302
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:18,743
but just remember, they're not.
Don't get too independent.

303
00:24:21,065 --> 00:24:24,023
Don't cut off
your own flesh and blood.

304
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:27,503
Anybody can disappoint you,

305
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:32,102
if you catch them at the wrong time
and that includes you, too, Alfred.

306
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:36,855
I know I'm not what you think
your mother ought to be.

307
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:39,459
I'm sorry if it embarrasses you

308
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,255
and I'm not going to make
any excuses.

309
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:44,416
Don't worry.
That's not why I'm leaving.

310
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:49,054
I could feel it last night

311
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:53,343
your very first look at me
down in the driveway.

312
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:56,378
What am I?

313
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:58,695
Ahopeless drunkard?

314
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:05,060
They'd rather have me that than
the other thing an unfaithful wife.

315
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:09,701
Apig, he called me.

316
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:16,656
Well, the drinking makes a good
cover-up for a lot of things.

317
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:20,501
Goodbye now, Mother.

318
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:24,340
"It wouldn't have happened
if she hadn't been a drinker."

319
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:28,225
"Martha Eaton
wouldn't do such things,

320
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:32,014
if she didn't like gin
and whiskey so much."

321
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:40,614
Well, little do they know.

322
00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:46,659
Little does anybody know.

323
00:26:02,985 --> 00:26:06,022
- May I have this dance?
- Oh, why, certainly.

324
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:14,579
- Will you pardon me just a moment?
- Sure.

325
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:17,697
Thank you.

326
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,662
Are you looking for me?

327
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:26,379
- I am if yourname is Lex Porter.
- My name is ClemmieShreve,

328
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:29,139
but I'll change it
if you'll stop looking further.

329
00:26:29,305 --> 00:26:32,138
Just how far am I allowed to look?

330
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:36,343
You're fresh.

331
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:40,817
- I like you. Sam?
- No, Alfred.

332
00:26:40,985 --> 00:26:43,863
Are you going to make a pass at me?

333
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:45,981
You believe
in long courtships, don't you?

334
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:49,376
- Who's got time? I'm crowding 19.
- What, years or guys?

335
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:52,142
Nasty.

336
00:26:53,465 --> 00:26:56,696
Come on. Let's dance
and crowd each other.

337
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,220
I better go fill my wooden leg.

338
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:01,296
You mean it's all over between us?

339
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:04,537
Well,
these things don't last forever.

340
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,425
Waiter,
tell me where I can find Mr Porter.

341
00:27:41,585 --> 00:27:44,338
He went into the den
a few minutes ago, sir.

342
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:54,135
- Excuse me.
- Hey, wait a minute.

343
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:59,497
- Alfred, when did you get here?
- Couple of minutes ago.

344
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:01,383
Come in. Join us.

345
00:28:01,545 --> 00:28:04,218
Alfred Eaton, Sage Rimmington.

346
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:09,778
- Sorry.
- So am I.

347
00:28:09,945 --> 00:28:13,574
Sage, this is the rover boy, I went
through Princeton and the navy with.

348
00:28:13,745 --> 00:28:16,100
Who knows what lies ahead?

349
00:28:16,705 --> 00:28:18,980
Darling, if you'll excuse me...

350
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:22,182
I think I'll put on
something more comfortable.

351
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:24,936
Like my husband.

352
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:28,063
Bye, sweetie.

353
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:34,822
- I like that.
- Oh, she's very inventive.

354
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:38,095
- How was it, boy?
- How was what?

355
00:28:38,265 --> 00:28:40,733
- Getting home.
- Great.

356
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:43,503
Yeah, me, too.

357
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,977
I snapped out of it, though.

358
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:50,375
Good booze, bad women.
It never fails to work.

359
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:53,184
How did things go
in the money department?

360
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:56,740
Our project.
Did you raise the dough?

361
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:00,101
Oh, your old man.

362
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,339
Well, I'll have another little talk
with Uncle Fritz.

363
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:09,457
I'll just charm him
into putting up the whole 500,000.

364
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,138
I don't want that.

365
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:14,701
I know you don't, sport,
but have we got any choice?

366
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,662
I don't mean to sound ungrateful,

367
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:19,293
but let's wait
till I can swing my own end.

368
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:21,456
I'm not going
into any business venture,

369
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:24,856
where I carry as much weight
as a poor relative.

370
00:29:25,025 --> 00:29:27,778
I understand.
It doesn't mean that much to me.

371
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:29,503
It does to me.

372
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:34,255
Boy, you did have a rough time
at home, didn't you?

373
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:36,734
We got to get you out of there.

374
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:39,214
- I've already taken care of that.
- Really?

375
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:43,302
- What are your plans?
- I don't know.

376
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:46,138
I was sort of, thinking about
that bachelor apartment

377
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:48,575
you were going to set up
in Gramercy Park.

378
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,213
Hey, now you're talking.

379
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,145
Play it by ear for a while.

380
00:29:56,305 --> 00:29:59,297
Well, you can use your ear.
I got better ideas.

381
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,376
Let's start right now.

382
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:09,660
Now, would you look at this?

383
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:11,781
200 beautiful Long Island virgins.

384
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:14,539
Markel's dance music,
buckets of champagne...

385
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:18,015
and I'm the guest of honor.
Now, how can I lose?

386
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,184
Unless I start getting drunk

387
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:22,256
and taking those little girls
upstairs.

388
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:25,223
- I met something called Clemmie.
- Oh, ClemmieShreve.

389
00:30:25,385 --> 00:30:27,376
Now, I'm saving that
for a rainy night.

390
00:30:28,465 --> 00:30:30,854
There he is Uncle Fritz.

391
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:41,178
Look who's here.

392
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:44,417
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Mr Thornton, how are you?

393
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:46,576
This party wouldn't
be complete without you.

394
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,303
Champagne for three.

395
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:51,303
- Have they been treating you
properly here? - No complaints.

396
00:30:51,465 --> 00:30:54,457
I hope you'll stay with us
for a good long visit.

397
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:58,294
- I may take you up on that.
- I hoped for this moment.

398
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:02,697
The three of us together like this
as I hoped for victory.

399
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:04,344
God bless you.

400
00:31:55,025 --> 00:31:58,017
- Thought I might as well
start at the top. - Did you?

401
00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,777
Pretty close to it.

402
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:02,254
Thanks for the compliment.
Who are you?

403
00:32:02,425 --> 00:32:05,178
Alfred Eaton. That wouldn't mean
anything to you. What's your name?

404
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:08,655
- Mary St. John.
- That's a nice, respectable name.

405
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:12,181
Well, of course it's respectable.
That's a silly thing to say.

406
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:14,381
Am I the first
to call it respectable?

407
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:16,695
You're the first
who ever raised the question.

408
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:20,096
Then I'm glad I called it
respectable instead of the opposite.

409
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:23,337
If you're trying to annoy me,
you're succeeding.

410
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:25,063
My manners are rusty.

411
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:28,023
You're the first girl
I've danced with for a long time.

412
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:30,415
Why didn't you bestow
that honor on someone inside

413
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:32,337
instead of here on the terrace?

414
00:32:32,505 --> 00:32:35,224
I rather like the view
from the terrace.

415
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:38,422
Then I saw you
and I liked the view even more.

416
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:40,701
You touch me deeply.

417
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:43,174
But not in the right places.

418
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,216
Well,
that was reasonably disagreeable.

419
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:56,864
Yes, and it was so easy.

420
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,583
Would you like
to go cry or something?

421
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:01,976
No, but I wouldn't mind,
if you faded away into the sunset.

422
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:05,933
Here comes the bird dog, to retrieve you. What's his
name?

423
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:08,903
- Jim Roper., - Oh, grim Jim Roper?

424
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:11,340
No. Dr Roper.
He's a psychiatrist.

425
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:14,497
Oh, sorry.
I hope you get well very soon.

426
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:17,576
Good night, Mr Eaton.

427
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,737
Good night, Miss St. John.
All yours, Doctor.

428
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:23,498
I know that.

429
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:36,819
Oh, I don't know about these girls.

430
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:39,897
I heard they were like minks
during the war.

431
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:43,535
- How are you doing?
- You tell me. Who's Mary St. John?

432
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:49,260
Her old man's with the DuPont
Corporation down in Wilmington.

433
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:52,258
- Fancy pedigree.
- Papers on both sides.

434
00:33:52,425 --> 00:33:55,178
- Hey, waiter.
You can forget about her. - Why?

435
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,616
- You want one?
- No.

436
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:03,543
She's secretly engaged to the guy
she's with, the doctor, Jim Roper.

437
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:06,534
I don't think
he's rich enough for her,

438
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:09,777
but if it isn't him
it'll be somebody else who is.

439
00:34:09,945 --> 00:34:11,901
If you're not thinking
about marrying her,

440
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:15,614
you can forget about anything else.
She's really saving it.

441
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:19,141
- Want to make a little bet?
- Oh, wake up, sport.

442
00:34:19,305 --> 00:34:21,261
You haven't got
the necessary qualifications.

443
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,620
Well, there are all kinds
of qualifications.

444
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:41,981
And straight ahead you'll notice
the famous Whitney estate.

445
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:44,295
Oh, and there to the right

446
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:48,140
is the estate
of James Duncan MacHardie.

447
00:34:48,305 --> 00:34:50,660
You notice the smoke
rising from the chimney?

448
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:53,857
In all probability
Mr MacHardie is burning money.

449
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,380
Stop hiding behind the glasses.

450
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,058
I'm not hiding.

451
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:02,774
You always manage to put something
between us like Jim Roper,

452
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:06,779
or your friend Sage Rimmington,
or the net of a tennis court.

453
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:12,060
What are you afraid of?

454
00:35:12,225 --> 00:35:15,376
- Let's row back to shore
shall we? - See what I mean?

455
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:19,218
I don't know why
you bother talking to me.

456
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:22,855
Every time you do, you get
sarcastic and we end up fighting.

457
00:35:23,025 --> 00:35:25,778
Now, if you don't approve of me,
just leave me alone.

458
00:35:25,945 --> 00:35:28,857
I'm sure I won't perish
from unhappiness.

459
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:31,904
This is the first time
we've been alone.

460
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:37,861
- How long are you
going to be here? -A month or so.

461
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:40,016
Then back to Wilmington?

462
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:46,775
I used to live very close to there
Port Johnson, Pennsylvania.

463
00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:51,578
I thought you lived in New York,
in Gramercy Park,

464
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:55,658
with Lex and all the stray girls
you could lay your hands on

465
00:35:55,825 --> 00:35:57,383
or so they tell me.

466
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,536
I think we'd better go back.

467
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:19,458
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean that.

468
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:23,379
I knew you would kiss me today,
but I didn't know I'd kiss you back.

469
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:26,662
It won't happen again so don't try
to get me alone somewhere.

470
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,702
- You'd like that.
- Stop it.

471
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:32,255
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm engaged to Jim Roper.

472
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:35,815
- You going to marry him?
- Well, I'm engaged to him.

473
00:36:36,825 --> 00:36:39,385
But you didn't say
you were going to marry him.

474
00:36:41,225 --> 00:36:45,503
Are you going to row me back to shore
or am I going to have to swim back?

475
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:47,420
Swim.

476
00:37:46,385 --> 00:37:48,103
Hello, Alfred.

477
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:51,655
- Who is it, Mary?
- It's just a friend, Mother.

478
00:37:53,425 --> 00:37:55,381
Well, who is it, Mary?

479
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:57,422
I think you better come in.

480
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:08,422
Mother, this is Alfred Eaton.
My mother.

481
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,257
- How do you do?
- Mr Eaton.

482
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:12,501
And my father.
Daddy, Alfred Eaton.

483
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,383
Pleased to meet you, sir.

484
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:17,176
I don't believe
we've seen you before.

485
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:20,974
- Are you from these parts?
- Port Johnson, Pennsylvania.

486
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:24,296
Oh, yes. The steel mill.
So, you're that Eaton.

487
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:26,543
What do you think of the strike?

488
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,139
I'm not in the mill,
but my father doesn't like it.

489
00:38:29,305 --> 00:38:30,863
I shouldn't think he would.

490
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:34,540
Well, what brings you to Wilmington
at this awkward hour?

491
00:38:34,705 --> 00:38:37,458
I was just duck hunting
on my way to New York.

492
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,581
Thought I'd say hello to Mary.

493
00:38:39,745 --> 00:38:42,623
- How was the shooting?
- Got a few tail feathers.

494
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:44,457
How is Jim?

495
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,663
- Jim?
- Yes.

496
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:50,659
- You mean Jim Roper?
- Yes. I assume you're close friends.

497
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:51,894
Not exactly.

498
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:55,102
Oh, well, now,
not a friend ofJim's.

499
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:57,825
- Isn't that a bit strange?
- No, Mother.

500
00:38:58,025 --> 00:39:00,539
Jim and I met Alfred
at the same time.

501
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,414
- Then he's really a friend of yours,
more than Jim's. - That's right.

502
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:08,817
Mr. Eaton, you're not in the mill.
What do you do?

503
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:11,977
I mean, besides duck hunting
in the middle of the week.

504
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:14,181
Actually, I've got
some exciting business plans.

505
00:39:14,345 --> 00:39:17,576
- I'm not allowed
to disclose them now. - I see.

506
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:23,737
Well, I guess I better be going.

507
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:27,215
My husband will
see you to the door. - No, I will.

508
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:30,901
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

509
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,384
- Good night, Mrs St. John.
- Goodbye, Mr Eaton.

510
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:50,738
Your mother and father
are sort of distant.

511
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,102
Now, what do you mean by that?

512
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:59,254
You know what I mean.

513
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:24,814
You never did believe
I was going to marry Jim, did you?

514
00:40:26,105 --> 00:40:28,938
I wrote him a letter
and I broke up with him.

515
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:30,936
Why didn't you tell me?

516
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:34,299
I don't know.
I didn't tell anybody.

517
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:37,337
Alfred?

518
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:44,303
Are you going to do something
and be somebody?

519
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:47,537
- For you?
- Yes.

520
00:40:47,705 --> 00:40:50,742
- Settle down?
- Yes.

521
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:52,623
With you?

522
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,576
Do you love me?

523
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:04,221
Oh, I want you.

524
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:07,937
More than anything
in the whole world.

525
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:11,822
Mary?

526
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:15,898
You're never going to want anybody
else as long as you live.

527
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:22,780
You better go in now.

528
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:54,661
I should think he'd know better.

529
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:57,658
- He wanted to see me.
- And you should, too.

530
00:41:57,825 --> 00:41:59,816
I happen to like Alfred, Mother.

531
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,976
The Eatons are nothing and nobody.

532
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,703
The motheris a drunkard.

533
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:06,060
The father
is a nouveau riche war profiteer.

534
00:42:06,225 --> 00:42:09,262
How do you know?
You haven't met them.

535
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:11,461
I have sources
of information.

536
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:15,015
If he were a gentleman, he'd stay
away before people start talking.

537
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:17,938
We don't want him.
That's all there is to it.

538
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:20,255
That isn't all there is to it.

539
00:42:20,425 --> 00:42:23,974
- I've broken my engagement to Jim.
- I can't believe it.

540
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:26,978
Mary...
I forbid you to see this man again.

541
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:30,774
I don't like that word forbid.
It makes me want to disobey you.

542
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:34,017
In that case,
I shall have a talk with Mr Eaton.

543
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,574
Alfred or his father?

544
00:42:36,745 --> 00:42:40,135
I meant the young man,
but you've given me an idea.

545
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:42,865
Don't do that, father!
It's my life!

546
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:52,057
I don't have to take
that kind of talk

547
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:55,661
from Eugene St. John
or any of that DuPont crowd!

548
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:59,574
- You didn't. You hung up on him.
- If you'd stayed where you belong...

549
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:04,057
- Maybe I don't like where I belong.
- That's what sours your insides

550
00:43:04,225 --> 00:43:07,376
that my blood and your mother's
is running through your veins.

551
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:10,298
That's why you get mixed up
with a family who doesn't want you.

552
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:14,458
- I'm not interested in her family!
- You can't buy respectability

553
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,775
by slipping a wedding ring on it.

554
00:43:16,945 --> 00:43:20,255
Sometimes you end up
with what you're running from.

555
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:23,940
- And remember, I told you.
- If you're through, I'm going.

556
00:43:24,105 --> 00:43:26,414
Where, back to that apartment
your friend Porter

557
00:43:26,585 --> 00:43:28,655
and all those questionable
goings-on?

558
00:43:28,825 --> 00:43:31,817
You haven't done an honest day's
work since you left the navy!

559
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:35,739
For your information I'm going into
business with Lex Porter.

560
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:39,575
Business?

561
00:43:41,545 --> 00:43:43,536
What kind of business?

562
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:47,175
- Aircraft, private planes.
- Airplanes.

563
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:50,337
That's right. We're going to design, them, build them and sell
them.

564
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:52,780
What are you going
to use for money?

565
00:43:52,945 --> 00:43:55,539
It's already been taken care of.

566
00:43:55,745 --> 00:43:58,862
- Lex's family financing you? V- That's right.

567
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:01,739
- 100%/º?
- Yes, 10o% .

568
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,975
You're puttingVyour head in a noose.

569
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:07,820
I was going to ask you for my share,
but I changed my mind.

570
00:44:07,985 --> 00:44:10,419
How much were you
going to ask me to give you?

571
00:44:10,585 --> 00:44:12,701
Not give, lend.
What's the difference?

572
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:15,220
Here's what I think
of your airplane business.

573
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:17,660
Put me down for 500 dollars.

574
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:21,340
Well, that's exactly
500 dollars more than I expected

575
00:44:21,505 --> 00:44:23,336
if I had asked you for it.

576
00:44:23,505 --> 00:44:25,860
- Wait a minute.
- It's too late.

577
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:27,424
It's something else.

578
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,899
There's something
I have to know.

579
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:41,579
I've been wanting to ask you.

580
00:44:43,105 --> 00:44:45,061
Come to the office.

581
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:52,380
I don't know how to start this.

582
00:44:53,185 --> 00:44:55,745
I mean, where's the beginning?

583
00:44:58,985 --> 00:45:01,818
Did you ever hear
of a man named Frolick?

584
00:45:04,265 --> 00:45:06,415
- Did you?
- Yes.

585
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:08,417
In what connection?

586
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:11,622
I'd rather you put the question
some other way.

587
00:45:11,785 --> 00:45:13,423
All right.

588
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,895
- Did you ever meet this man?
- I saw him once.

589
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:20,505
- Did you beat him up?
- Yes, I did.

590
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,297
Thank God.

591
00:45:24,585 --> 00:45:26,621
Thank God it was you.

592
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:33,574
Maybe you're a lot of things
I never gave you credit for,

593
00:45:33,745 --> 00:45:38,261
but a man my age
can't change so quickly.

594
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:42,704
I can admit I've been wrong
all these years,

595
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,538
but that wouldn't
make anything right.

596
00:45:45,705 --> 00:45:48,173
It won't take away
what I felt about you,

597
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:52,418
what I still feel, regardless
of what I know in my brain.

598
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:55,418
Some time
when you have children, you'll know.

599
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:58,941
One of them is in here.

600
00:45:59,945 --> 00:46:02,857
He shines. His voice is music.

601
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:07,581
You love him as though
he never lived in his mother's body.

602
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:11,902
That's the way Billy was to me
long before he died.

603
00:46:12,065 --> 00:46:16,616
And when he died, there was nobody
who understood what happened to me.

604
00:46:16,785 --> 00:46:19,777
You were living,
you were alive,

605
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:23,103
a deliberate thing God did to me.

606
00:46:23,265 --> 00:46:26,018
I didn't want another son
or anyone in my life.

607
00:46:26,185 --> 00:46:28,619
Not you, not even your mother.
Just Billy.

608
00:46:31,385 --> 00:46:34,536
That's why your mother took Frolick,

609
00:46:36,185 --> 00:46:38,540
not because she's immoral,

610
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:42,254
because I didn't even tell her
I didn't love her anymore.

611
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,501
She had to find that out for herself.

612
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:47,054
I guess she knew it before I did.

613
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:49,861
And yet, even knowing,

614
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:55,258
how badly it turned out
for everybody, including myself,

615
00:46:57,425 --> 00:47:00,462
I would do the same thing over again.

616
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:06,463
It was so wonderful
loving Billy that much.

617
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,061
Always in your thoughts.

618
00:47:10,265 --> 00:47:14,383
I can feel his arms
around my neck this minute.

619
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:16,574
Don't go.

620
00:47:18,265 --> 00:47:21,496
Don't go?
What do you think I am?

621
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,462
Alfred, I didn't mean it!
Alfred, my son...

622
00:47:37,665 --> 00:47:39,257
Alfred?

623
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:46,783
- Hello, Mary.
- Get in.

624
00:47:47,585 --> 00:47:49,496
Good evening.

625
00:47:53,425 --> 00:47:55,097
Good evening.

626
00:47:59,145 --> 00:48:01,659
How's your father?

627
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:06,182
It's hard to tell. He's always
the same man sick or well.

628
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:10,219
Yes. Old men may seem unchangeable
to you, Alfred,

629
00:48:10,385 --> 00:48:13,263
but life itself now,
there's a different thing.

630
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:14,380
Consider this.

631
00:48:14,585 --> 00:48:18,464
Aweek ago, I was opposed
to any thought of you two marrying.

632
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:22,584
Tonight, I'm not only reconciled
to it I'm secretly in favor of it.

633
00:48:22,745 --> 00:48:25,817
Yes. Life's full
of unpredictable ironies.

634
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:29,216
Now, you wouldn't have thought
it was going to be your own father

635
00:48:29,385 --> 00:48:32,104
who would be responsible
for this change in my attitude.

636
00:48:32,265 --> 00:48:33,618
My father? How?

637
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,935
By having this unfortunate
heart attack

638
00:48:36,105 --> 00:48:38,380
which automatically
transforms your life.

639
00:48:38,545 --> 00:48:41,184
You suddenly change
from irresponsible young man

640
00:48:41,345 --> 00:48:44,382
to the active head of a family
and Eaton Iron and Steel.

641
00:48:44,545 --> 00:48:48,060
And this removes
the objections we had to you

642
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:49,863
as a prospective son-in-law.

643
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:52,778
You haven't had experience
running a mill, Alfred,

644
00:48:52,945 --> 00:48:56,255
but you can be sure I'll help you
in any way I can.

645
00:48:56,465 --> 00:49:00,094
Thank you very much, but I haven't
got the slightest intention

646
00:49:00,265 --> 00:49:01,698
of running my father's mill.

647
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:04,425
I plan to be active head
of my own family,

648
00:49:04,585 --> 00:49:06,655
which means Mary and me.

649
00:49:06,825 --> 00:49:08,861
Good night, sir.
Good night, Mary.

650
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,581
Do you give up?

651
00:49:18,945 --> 00:49:21,015
Yes, I give up.

652
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:33,023
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

653
00:49:33,225 --> 00:49:34,738
Eugene, lovely day for a wedding.

654
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:49,101
Hello, Mary.

655
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:51,779
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

656
00:49:51,945 --> 00:49:54,743
- Don't go, Sage.
- I think I'd better.

657
00:49:56,905 --> 00:50:00,534
I read all your letters.
I know exactly how you feel.

658
00:50:02,865 --> 00:50:05,982
Does he know you the way I do?

659
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:09,296
Does he know that wild
and wonderful nature of yours?

660
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:11,854
I think you'd better leave.

661
00:50:12,305 --> 00:50:15,217
- It won't work.
- Please go.

662
00:50:15,385 --> 00:50:18,661
You don't have to marry him
to get what you want of him.

663
00:50:20,945 --> 00:50:22,901
Good luck, Mary.

664
00:50:52,305 --> 00:50:53,533
Yeah?

665
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:56,693
Hi. What's the matter
you change your mind?

666
00:50:56,865 --> 00:50:59,095
Alfred, do you love me?

667
00:50:59,305 --> 00:51:01,580
Do I love you?
Of course I love you.

668
00:51:01,745 --> 00:51:03,417
Is that why you called?

669
00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:09,699
All right.
I love you. I love you. I love yoi.

670
00:51:10,225 --> 00:51:12,819
And incidentally
we have a date tonight.

671
00:51:13,345 --> 00:51:16,143
Careful, now.
Somebody might be listening.

672
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:18,858
Yeah.

673
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:20,984
Bye-bye.

674
00:51:25,985 --> 00:51:28,818
Hi. Come on in.
I've got a great idea.

675
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:32,859
Porter-Eaton Flying Machine Company.

676
00:51:34,585 --> 00:51:36,655
Tailspins, Incorporated.

677
00:51:37,985 --> 00:51:39,816
Bottoms Up Corporation?

678
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:42,975
If Uncle Fritz ever heard me
talking like this

679
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:45,181
he'd probably take back the money.

680
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:48,415
Alfred, you trust me, don't you?

681
00:51:48,585 --> 00:51:50,735
Why, sure, I do. You're my best man.

682
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:53,461
I have to tell you something, then.

683
00:51:55,465 --> 00:51:56,864
I can't.

684
00:51:58,505 --> 00:52:00,735
Your mother
just phoned from the hospital.

685
00:52:02,065 --> 00:52:05,216
She told me not to say anything
especially to you.

686
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:07,457
What is it?

687
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:11,299
Your father died a few minutes ago.

688
00:52:17,225 --> 00:52:18,863
I'm sorry.

689
00:52:24,505 --> 00:52:27,463
- Shall I tell them
to call off the wedding? - No.

690
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,734
Well, I guess he hated me so much,

691
00:52:48,225 --> 00:52:49,897
he couldn't even...

692
00:52:51,945 --> 00:52:55,381
Stand to be alive
on the day I got married.

693
00:53:14,145 --> 00:53:16,215
Oh, I like this little baby.

694
00:53:16,385 --> 00:53:19,741
She's like my ideal woman:
handles easily,

695
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,021
levels off without too much work.

696
00:53:22,225 --> 00:53:25,900
- Hey, buddy, you're not with me.
- Oh, I'm with you.

697
00:53:26,785 --> 00:53:28,264
Come on, what is it?

698
00:53:28,425 --> 00:53:32,100
I saw those new engines
in the hangar today.

699
00:53:32,265 --> 00:53:34,221
The navy ordered
100 from Continental.

700
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:36,945
- We heard about it and got two.
- Who's we?

701
00:53:37,105 --> 00:53:39,619
- Von Elm and myself.
- Why wasn't I consulted?

702
00:53:39,785 --> 00:53:42,015
- We need engines, don't we?
- Yeah.

703
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:45,416
I don't like your going over my head.
How do you like it?

704
00:53:45,585 --> 00:53:47,815
We're about to buzz
your happy little home

705
00:53:47,985 --> 00:53:49,623
and your happy little wife.

706
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:54,376
The least you can do is put a smile, on that sour pan of
yours.

707
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:40,901
What did you marry,
a man or a mosquito?

708
00:54:41,065 --> 00:54:42,418
Very much a man, Sage.

709
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,662
A delicious man and all man
from the top of his head

710
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,656
to the tip of his toes.

711
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:50,494
What was that"ah-ah"for?

712
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:52,223
You've been married over a year.

713
00:54:52,385 --> 00:54:54,979
If you're about to say,
"Why no children?" don't.

714
00:54:55,145 --> 00:54:58,342
- That's my doing, not his.
- Me talk about children?

715
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:00,496
I hate the little stinkers.

716
00:55:00,665 --> 00:55:02,860
You absolutely shock me, Sage.

717
00:55:03,025 --> 00:55:07,177
Why, because I say
what you secretly feel?

718
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,017
Oh, stop it.

719
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:11,301
It's unfair, you know,

720
00:55:11,465 --> 00:55:14,138
the way I tell you everything
about Steve and me,

721
00:55:14,305 --> 00:55:16,296
what it's like when
we're alone together...

722
00:55:16,465 --> 00:55:19,218
And you not only
don't let me in on a thing...

723
00:55:19,385 --> 00:55:21,819
that goes on between you
and that gorgeous fellow,

724
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,863
you even try to pull
the wool over my eyes.

725
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:29,655
The trouble with you is you're
nothing but a frustrated Peeping Tom.

726
00:55:29,825 --> 00:55:31,622
Wrong gender, darling.

727
00:55:31,785 --> 00:55:34,777
Come on now,
woman-to-woman, what's he like?

728
00:55:37,185 --> 00:55:39,824
He's fine.

729
00:55:39,985 --> 00:55:42,453
If only he'd come home
into your waiting arms

730
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:44,183
a little more often, huh?

731
00:55:44,385 --> 00:55:47,343
Precisely what can a group
ofred-blooded American males,

732
00:55:47,505 --> 00:55:50,656
do to an airplane propeller
until 4:oo in the morning?

733
00:55:51,425 --> 00:55:53,416
Well, I don't think I'd want a man

734
00:55:53,585 --> 00:55:55,701
who wasn't interested
in being successful.

735
00:55:55,865 --> 00:55:57,901
Oh, I'm curious.

736
00:55:58,065 --> 00:56:01,057
What does success look like
when you turn out the lights?

737
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:02,704
Oh, you're impossible, Sage.

738
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:06,062
I say if work is a man's mistress

739
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:08,420
then there's only one answer
for the wife...

740
00:56:08,585 --> 00:56:12,134
Another man.
And how is Jim Roper these days?

741
00:56:12,305 --> 00:56:15,138
- Ever hear from him?
- Of course not.

742
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,863
Now, don't let faint heart

743
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:19,255
spoil life's golden
opportunities, darling.

744
00:56:19,425 --> 00:56:23,418
I don't want to seem a bore,
but I'm not interested in this.

745
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:26,580
- What gives?
- I don't know.

746
00:56:26,745 --> 00:56:28,542
- Pull it up.
- I'm trying.

747
00:56:59,145 --> 00:57:00,544
What happened?

748
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:04,095
Fortunately, he woke up in time.

749
00:57:04,265 --> 00:57:06,381
Looked like the new stabilizer to me.

750
00:57:06,545 --> 00:57:08,217
What new stabilizer?

751
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,417
We're trying out
a modified version of the old one.

752
00:57:11,585 --> 00:57:14,338
What's wrong with the unmodified
version of the old one?

753
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:17,861
Well, nothing, really, but
there's always room for refinement.

754
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:20,255
Wait a minute.

755
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:25,415
I won't make a point
out of the fact

756
00:57:25,585 --> 00:57:27,303
that nobody told me
what's happening.

757
00:57:27,465 --> 00:57:29,262
I got a bigger point to make.

758
00:57:29,425 --> 00:57:33,054
You and Von Elm must think we're
running an aeronautical laboratory.

759
00:57:33,225 --> 00:57:34,977
We're designing planes,
refining planes,

760
00:57:35,145 --> 00:57:36,976
modifying planes,
redesigning planes.

761
00:57:37,145 --> 00:57:39,136
We're doing everything
but selling planes.

762
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:41,102
Either we're in business or not.

763
00:57:41,265 --> 00:57:43,256
I think we got
a good plane there.

764
00:57:43,425 --> 00:57:47,338
Let's freeze the design, start
manufacturing, and start selling.

765
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,382
And if you don't see it that way,

766
00:57:49,545 --> 00:57:52,013
we ought to sit down
and have a serious talk.

767
00:57:54,945 --> 00:57:57,015
In your office or mine?

768
00:58:04,585 --> 00:58:08,658
Every time Sage start stalking
like that, I get a little crazy.

769
00:58:08,825 --> 00:58:12,101
I don't want to win out anymore.
I just want to get out.

770
00:58:12,265 --> 00:58:14,062
I feel like I'm blushing all over.

771
00:58:14,225 --> 00:58:18,377
I'd hate to have her think I'm a...
What do you call me?

772
00:58:18,545 --> 00:58:20,024
Ahot number.

773
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:23,665
Lex doesn't give a hang
about business.

774
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:25,816
I went into this
to make money,

775
00:58:25,985 --> 00:58:28,738
not in five year, next year,
tomorrow.

776
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:32,056
All I could think
of was one thing.

777
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:36,296
How much I wanted you.

778
00:58:36,465 --> 00:58:39,821
If he and Von Elm want
to play Tiddlywinks,

779
00:58:40,025 --> 00:58:43,495
with Fritz Thornton's money
they can do it without me.

780
00:58:43,665 --> 00:58:47,294
Sunday, I'll tell them either
I get some control, or I want out.

781
00:58:54,585 --> 00:58:56,337
Darling?

782
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,536
You talk too much.

783
00:59:02,425 --> 00:59:06,384
- So long, Mary, Jim.
- See you back at the house.

784
00:59:18,065 --> 00:59:21,023
- Can we go inside,
Mr Thornton? - You cold?

785
00:59:21,185 --> 00:59:23,619
I'd like to have
a few words with you.

786
00:59:23,825 --> 00:59:26,293
Sure you don't want to
keep an eye on Mary?

787
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:30,777
- Why? She's a good skater.
- That's not exactly what I meant.

788
00:59:35,945 --> 00:59:39,654
- You were my girl.
- Obviously I wasn't your girl.

789
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:42,783
You wouldn't say awful things,
about somebody you cared about.

790
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:46,176
You made a fool out of me.
Think I'd be a little gentleman?

791
00:59:46,345 --> 00:59:50,133
If you wanted to make me
feel terrible, you've succeeded.

792
01:00:10,105 --> 01:00:11,618
Jim, don't.

793
01:00:12,145 --> 01:00:14,613
Now when I hold a girl,
I pretend it's you.

794
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:16,616
That's a filthy thing to say.

795
01:00:17,465 --> 01:00:20,218
I've had a dozen girls
since you left me,

796
01:00:21,025 --> 01:00:23,095
but they've all been you, Mary.

797
01:00:23,865 --> 01:00:26,254
That's the way
it's going to be with you.

798
01:00:26,425 --> 01:00:29,223
Some night in bed,
he'll turn into me.

799
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:39,264
You angry, Alfred,
or just thinking?

800
01:00:40,505 --> 01:00:41,654
What?

801
01:00:41,825 --> 01:00:43,941
Oh, no, I'm not angry.

802
01:00:44,585 --> 01:00:47,975
I expected you
to support Lex and Von Elm.

803
01:00:50,705 --> 01:00:53,583
I admit it would be easier
to make money now,

804
01:00:53,745 --> 01:00:57,579
but it would be nothing compared
to what might come in 5 or 10 years

805
01:00:57,745 --> 01:01:01,181
if the itch for quick profits could,
remain unscratched for a while.

806
01:01:02,505 --> 01:01:07,181
Well, I have to make a decision
then don't I, MrThornton?

807
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:11,460
Yes, I guess you do,
but not today.

808
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:14,344
On the seventh day
the businessman should rest.

809
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:23,934
If it was nothing
why were you running away from him?

810
01:01:24,105 --> 01:01:27,256
I was not running away.
My fingers were freezing.

811
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:29,541
Do you want a wife
with frozen fingers?

812
01:01:29,705 --> 01:01:33,778
- What did you two talk about?
- He still loves me.

813
01:01:33,945 --> 01:01:35,583
Thanks.

814
01:01:35,785 --> 01:01:39,095
You wouldn't have believed me if
I said we talked about the weather.

815
01:01:39,265 --> 01:01:40,857
Did he kiss you?

816
01:01:42,385 --> 01:01:45,377
- I bet he tried to kiss you.
- Not only that.

817
01:01:45,545 --> 01:01:49,060
He picked me up in his arms
and carried me off.

818
01:01:49,225 --> 01:01:51,216
You're just trying
to make a joke out of it.

819
01:01:51,385 --> 01:01:54,218
Darling, you're being silly.
I like him.

820
01:01:54,385 --> 01:01:56,103
I always have liked him.

821
01:01:56,265 --> 01:01:58,859
You can't expect me
to stop liking my men friends

822
01:01:59,025 --> 01:02:02,256
any more than I can expect you
to stop liking your women friends.

823
01:02:02,425 --> 01:02:06,737
- Let's not talk about it.
- That suits me fine.

824
01:02:11,025 --> 01:02:12,663
Sandy! Sandy!

825
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:15,259
Alfred, stop the car. Look!

826
01:02:30,745 --> 01:02:32,736
Sandy fell in!

827
01:02:52,945 --> 01:02:55,982
Oh, sir! Mr MacHardie!
Sandy fell in.

828
01:02:56,145 --> 01:02:59,296
He wouldn't listen to me.

829
01:03:06,305 --> 01:03:08,102
Here, give him to me.

830
01:03:14,985 --> 01:03:18,341
- Get away from here. Who are you?
- I'm his grandfather.

831
01:03:23,225 --> 01:03:26,297
Call a doctor,
the fire department.

832
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,736
It's all right.

833
01:04:00,385 --> 01:04:03,218
You can't begrudge them
for wanting to thank you.

834
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:05,819
I wish he'd let it go
at sending flowers.

835
01:04:05,985 --> 01:04:09,455
You rescued the grandson
of James Duncan MacHardie,

836
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:12,662
who is only the most famous
financier in America.

837
01:04:12,825 --> 01:04:13,974
I know.

838
01:04:14,145 --> 01:04:16,659
We'll get a lot more
than a houseful of flowers

839
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:19,134
and an evening of gratitude,
you can be sure.

840
01:04:19,305 --> 01:04:21,341
First he'll look us over

841
01:04:21,505 --> 01:04:23,814
to find out whether
we're sufficiently respectable.

842
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:26,585
- That word again.
- Then he'll look me over

843
01:04:26,745 --> 01:04:28,815
to find out whether
my halo's bright enough

844
01:04:28,985 --> 01:04:34,105
to qualify me for one of those desks
of his at number25 Wall Street.

845
01:04:34,265 --> 01:04:37,621
An aging fortress
of banking integrity.

846
01:04:37,785 --> 01:04:40,219
You must admit
the timing's perfect

847
01:04:40,385 --> 01:04:43,343
what with you planning to leave Lex
and no job in sight.

848
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:45,735
How do you know I'll take his job?

849
01:04:45,945 --> 01:04:49,381
Because I know you, darling,
and you're very shrewd.

850
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,576
You're not at all the kind of man

851
01:04:51,745 --> 01:04:54,213
to turn down
the opportunity of a lifetime.

852
01:04:54,385 --> 01:04:57,138
No matter how much
you protest, darling.

853
01:04:57,385 --> 01:05:01,936
Besides, doesn't Wall Street close
up shop early in the afternoon?

854
01:05:02,105 --> 01:05:05,256
I love the idea of your being
available to me more often.

855
01:05:05,425 --> 01:05:08,656
- Is that all it would mean to you?
- What's wrong with a girl

856
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:11,703
worrying about her own
needs now and then?

857
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:22,219
How nice of you to come.

858
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:24,580
I'm Jean Duffy,
Mr MacHardie's daughter,

859
01:05:24,745 --> 01:05:26,701
and Sandy's very grateful mother.

860
01:05:26,865 --> 01:05:29,220
This is my husband Creighton.

861
01:05:29,385 --> 01:05:32,218
- We wanted to thank you alone...
- And we do.

862
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:35,775
But we also wanted Sandy to meet
the gentleman who saved his life.

863
01:05:35,945 --> 01:05:37,537
Oh Sandy, dear.

864
01:05:38,825 --> 01:05:41,339
- This is Mrs Eaton.
- Hello, Sandy.

865
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:44,895
- And Mr Eaton you have met before.
- Glad you dried off.

866
01:05:45,105 --> 01:05:48,984
- Thank you very much for fishing
me out of the pond. My pleasure.

867
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,817
- And? , -And...

868
01:05:52,025 --> 01:05:55,540
Oh, yes. And it's a good thing
I wasn't any smaller

869
01:05:55,705 --> 01:05:59,744
or you'd have had to throw me back.
- Oh, very good.

870
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:02,260
- Good. Now, son, skedaddle.
- Good night, Sandy.

871
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,461
Now you're ready
for your cocktail.

872
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:07,093
Creighton,
will you and Mrs Eaton lead the way?

873
01:06:07,265 --> 01:06:09,779
You were very sweet to him, Mr Eaton.

874
01:06:13,145 --> 01:06:15,340
I'd like you to meet
the other guests.

875
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:17,018
Mrs Ripley...

876
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,618
Lady Sevringham...

877
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:20,497
Mrs Pearson...

878
01:06:20,665 --> 01:06:21,654
Lord Sevringham.

879
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:25,704
- My father you know, of course.
- Glad to see you again, sir.

880
01:06:25,905 --> 01:06:27,418
And MrThornton.

881
01:06:27,585 --> 01:06:30,145
MrAnd Mrs Eaton.
I think that does it.

882
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:33,256
I didn't expect to see you here.

883
01:06:33,425 --> 01:06:36,622
It might turn out
to be something of an occasion.

884
01:06:37,465 --> 01:06:39,615
Watch out for Creighton Duffy.

885
01:06:39,785 --> 01:06:41,503
He's a member
of Machardie and Company,

886
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:45,544
but only because he's a son-in-law.
Resents competition.

887
01:06:47,345 --> 01:06:51,133
You have a Portland, Oregon
and a Portland, Maine.

888
01:06:51,305 --> 01:06:54,536
Why, when you have a new country
like this and a splendid opportunity

889
01:06:54,705 --> 01:06:57,583
to start from scratch
with all-new names

890
01:06:57,745 --> 01:06:59,736
why must you have two Portlands?

891
01:06:59,905 --> 01:07:02,658
Well, we have a lot worse than that.

892
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:05,379
- You've heard of California.
- I have a friend there.

893
01:07:05,545 --> 01:07:08,617
- And you've heard of Indiana.
- Yes, I think so.

894
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:12,738
- And Pennsylvania.
- Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania.

895
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:16,062
But we have a California
in Pennsylvania,

896
01:07:16,225 --> 01:07:19,058
and an Indiana in Pennsylvania.
- I'm not at all surprised.

897
01:07:19,225 --> 01:07:22,058
You have a place in New York
called the Polo Grounds

898
01:07:22,225 --> 01:07:25,740
and all they do there
is play baseball and football.

899
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:31,336
I never saw an elephant
in Piccadilly Circus. Did you?

900
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:38,777
Well, gentlemen, I think
brandy and cigars are in order.

901
01:07:40,465 --> 01:07:42,774
Creighton,
will you play host in the lounge

902
01:07:42,945 --> 01:07:44,981
while I have a few words
with Mr Eaton?

903
01:08:00,105 --> 01:08:03,063
I like the way you handle yourself,
young man.

904
01:08:03,265 --> 01:08:04,823
It was a lucky shot.

905
01:08:04,985 --> 01:08:08,216
I was not referring
to your manipulation of a cue stick.

906
01:08:09,945 --> 01:08:13,255
I've made inquiries
about you, Mr Eaton

907
01:08:13,425 --> 01:08:15,939
and the results
have been most satisfying.

908
01:08:16,105 --> 01:08:17,936
I'm very flattered.

909
01:08:18,305 --> 01:08:20,819
I'm not in the habit

910
01:08:20,985 --> 01:08:24,455
of offering positions
with MacHardie and Company

911
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:29,255
to men who qualify
as lifeguards and nothing more.

912
01:08:29,425 --> 01:08:31,495
That seems to make good sense,

913
01:08:31,665 --> 01:08:36,341
just as a sensible man ought
never to accept anything

914
01:08:36,505 --> 01:08:39,019
that life has to offer

915
01:08:39,785 --> 01:08:42,504
unless he's absolutely sure
that that's what he wants.

916
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:44,940
Can a man be that sure of his goals?

917
01:08:45,105 --> 01:08:47,744
- I think so.
- Tell me yours.

918
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:50,416
I want to live in a big world

919
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,337
compete with big people,
and make big money.

920
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:55,895
- How big is big?
- As big as you are, sir.

921
01:08:56,105 --> 01:08:58,096
Certainly bigger than my father.

922
01:08:58,265 --> 01:09:01,814
I always wanted
to top my father, too.

923
01:09:01,985 --> 01:09:04,419
It helped me to achieve what I did

924
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,537
even if I fell short
by almost 30 million.

925
01:09:07,705 --> 01:09:09,423
I don't intend to fall short.

926
01:09:09,585 --> 01:09:13,578
And preferably not with your present
business associates?

927
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:19,177
There is such a thing
as information, Mr Eaton.

928
01:09:19,665 --> 01:09:21,337
And you've got it.

929
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:26,140
- How long will it take you
to settle your affairs? - Two months.

930
01:09:27,185 --> 01:09:30,097
- Shall we join the ladies?
- At your pleasure.

931
01:10:09,545 --> 01:10:11,263
Yeah.

932
01:10:11,865 --> 01:10:13,184
What?

933
01:10:13,825 --> 01:10:15,736
You're right, Mary. I'm sorry.

934
01:10:15,905 --> 01:10:17,304
I said I'm sorry.

935
01:10:18,585 --> 01:10:22,214
Well, why don't you go on ahead,
then and I'll meet you there.

936
01:10:23,305 --> 01:10:25,057
Yeah. What?

937
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:26,943
Yeah. Right now. Absolutely.

938
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:40,300
- When will he get back?
- In time for Christmas, he hopes.

939
01:10:40,465 --> 01:10:41,978
What's he doing in California?

940
01:10:42,145 --> 01:10:45,581
He's not in California.
That was last year. It's Colorado.

941
01:10:45,785 --> 01:10:48,219
What's he doing in Colorado?

942
01:10:48,385 --> 01:10:50,899
Buying a copper mine
for Mr MacHardie.

943
01:10:51,065 --> 01:10:53,738
Well, make sure he buys you one, too.

944
01:10:54,305 --> 01:10:57,900
How is every little thing
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana?

945
01:10:58,065 --> 01:11:00,101
It is Louisiana, isn't it?

946
01:11:00,265 --> 01:11:04,497
Alfred, you'll have to speak up.
I can't hear you.

947
01:11:05,505 --> 01:11:10,135
Look, why don't you come a little
closer like... New York City?

948
01:11:10,305 --> 01:11:12,421
That's in New York state, remember?

949
01:11:13,385 --> 01:11:15,137
I am not.

950
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:18,342
I've only had one teeny
little glass of champagne.

951
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:21,782
Oh, just the usual crowd.

952
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:25,858
You know, Sage and Steve,
Nancy and Parker Wells and...

953
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:28,499
Nobody else you know, I don't think.

954
01:11:29,345 --> 01:11:31,575
Yes, dear, I will.

955
01:11:32,825 --> 01:11:34,224
You, too.

956
01:11:34,385 --> 01:11:36,057
Bye-bye.

957
01:11:45,585 --> 01:11:48,497
Tell him we can meet
whenever it's convenient.

958
01:11:48,745 --> 01:11:50,064
- Mr Eaton...
- Yes?

959
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:54,104
Mr MacHardie wishes
to have lunch with you at 12:oo.

960
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:56,176
I've got another engagement.

961
01:11:56,945 --> 01:12:00,733
- It is now 3 minutes to 12:oo, sir.
- All right.

962
01:12:00,905 --> 01:12:02,623
Thank you, sir.

963
01:12:07,065 --> 01:12:09,295
See if you can catch
Mrs Eaton at home...

964
01:12:09,465 --> 01:12:12,502
and if it's too late,
just call the restaurant. - Yes.

965
01:12:12,665 --> 01:12:15,498
You will be there posing
as one of our bond salesmen

966
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,863
opening up new territory
eyes open, ear to the ground.

967
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:24,459
Find out all you can about a man
named Ralph WBenziger.

968
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:27,901
- Benziger. - If we ever make sizable
commitments in that area,

969
01:12:28,065 --> 01:12:31,296
this is the man
we might want to take charge

970
01:12:31,465 --> 01:12:35,140
provided his hands are clean.
That's for you to find out,

971
01:12:35,305 --> 01:12:38,183
what kind of man he is.

972
01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:39,858
A question, sir.

973
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:43,614
Was it Mr Duffy that suggested me
for this expedition to Mountain City?

974
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:45,537
In the past, you might have felt

975
01:12:45,705 --> 01:12:48,503
that Mr Duffy recommended you
for other surveys

976
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:52,453
in order to keep you
away from home base.

977
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,741
Perhaps that may have been
in his mind.

978
01:12:54,905 --> 01:12:57,055
It's of no interest to me.

979
01:12:57,265 --> 01:12:59,620
I am interested only in results.

980
01:12:59,785 --> 01:13:02,902
I may tell you, young man,
they have been enormously profitable

981
01:13:03,065 --> 01:13:06,262
and largely due to the shrewdness
of your reports.

982
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:07,744
Thank you, sir.

983
01:13:07,945 --> 01:13:10,698
Not to go beyond
the walls of this room...

984
01:13:10,865 --> 01:13:13,823
The only gold stars on
my son-in-law's record

985
01:13:13,985 --> 01:13:17,944
have been his recommendation
of you for these assignments.

986
01:13:18,105 --> 01:13:21,700
- How long will I be gone?
- You'll be there about two months.

987
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:24,504
- Can I take my wife?
- I prefer not.

988
01:13:24,665 --> 01:13:28,897
- Plan to leave not later
than Friday night. - Friday night?

989
01:13:29,065 --> 01:13:31,533
We just moved into
our New York apartment.

990
01:13:31,705 --> 01:13:33,741
We've got 35 people
coming over on Sunday.

991
01:13:33,905 --> 01:13:36,465
I've never made
any sacrifice for this firm

992
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,775
that I didn't feel amply repaid.

993
01:13:38,945 --> 01:13:40,583
No dessert for me.

994
01:13:40,745 --> 01:13:42,975
Good luck and good day to you.

995
01:13:52,105 --> 01:13:55,177
- Well, good night, Mary.
- Thank you, Steve.

996
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:10,695
Good morning.

997
01:14:10,945 --> 01:14:12,742
Good morning.

998
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:17,174
Why didn't you meet us?
Didn't you see the note I left?

999
01:14:17,345 --> 01:14:20,621
I got home too late.
I had to finish that Dunham Report.

1000
01:14:20,785 --> 01:14:24,460
I suppose I'm supposed to know
what the Dunham Report is.

1001
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:28,618
One of the trivial little things
that helps pay to keep you

1002
01:14:28,785 --> 01:14:31,458
neck and neck with Harper's Bazaar.
- Thank you.

1003
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:36,064
Incidentally, just where
did you wear that little number

1004
01:14:36,225 --> 01:14:37,897
until 2:oo this morning?

1005
01:14:38,065 --> 01:14:40,295
I wore this little number
to the Mona Lisa.

1006
01:14:40,505 --> 01:14:42,496
Would you unzip me
in the back, please?

1007
01:14:42,665 --> 01:14:46,453
I thought Sage
didn't like that place anymore.

1008
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:48,456
Oh, Sage wasn't along.

1009
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,663
She stayed home
with a bad tooth or something.

1010
01:14:52,825 --> 01:14:56,579
- What, just you and her husband?
- Just little old us.

1011
01:14:56,745 --> 01:14:59,464
Can't you do any better than that?

1012
01:14:59,665 --> 01:15:01,735
As a matter of fact,
I could have,

1013
01:15:01,905 --> 01:15:05,944
but he had another date
with the Dingham Report. - Dunham.

1014
01:15:06,105 --> 01:15:08,619
Oh, so sorry. Dunham.

1015
01:15:08,785 --> 01:15:10,980
Suppose you tell me
what was so important

1016
01:15:11,145 --> 01:15:12,863
that you left me
sitting alone today...

1017
01:15:13,025 --> 01:15:16,097
over a chicken salad sandwich
while you had lunch with MacHardie.

1018
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:18,142
He's giving me a new assignment.

1019
01:15:19,305 --> 01:15:21,865
The coal regions ofPennsylvania.

1020
01:15:22,905 --> 01:15:26,215
I'd give you the details,
but you're obviously not interested.

1021
01:15:26,785 --> 01:15:28,821
I have to leave Friday night.

1022
01:15:30,145 --> 01:15:34,821
- And what about the party on Sunday?
- I know. I'm sorry.

1023
01:15:34,985 --> 01:15:38,341
And just how long do you suppose
you'll be gone this time?

1024
01:15:38,545 --> 01:15:39,898
About two months.

1025
01:15:40,065 --> 01:15:44,900
And of course I am forbidden to go
with you or to visit you because...

1026
01:15:45,065 --> 01:15:47,340
It's not exactly forbidden, but...

1027
01:15:48,305 --> 01:15:52,218
The trouble with this company
is it's run by old men.

1028
01:15:52,425 --> 01:15:54,893
I hope you know what
they're doing to us.

1029
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:57,420
What should I do, resign?

1030
01:15:57,585 --> 01:16:01,100
I'm not going to sit around
and stare at four walls again.

1031
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:04,257
- You don't have to. - If somebody
invites me to the theater,

1032
01:16:04,425 --> 01:16:07,098
I'm going to the theater.
- Go to the theater!

1033
01:16:07,305 --> 01:16:11,059
What if it's somebody
you don't know? Aman.

1034
01:16:11,225 --> 01:16:14,535
I don't want you having dates
with guys I don't know.

1035
01:16:14,705 --> 01:16:16,980
Suppose it's somebody
you know and don't like?

1036
01:16:17,145 --> 01:16:20,217
- For instance?
- Jim Roper.

1037
01:16:21,665 --> 01:16:26,375
- What made you think of him?
- He's coming to the party on Sunday.

1038
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:28,501
How did that happen?

1039
01:16:28,665 --> 01:16:31,657
I ran into him on Fifth Avenue
and invited him.

1040
01:16:32,465 --> 01:16:35,696
In that case,
I'm glad I'm not going to be here.

1041
01:16:36,385 --> 01:16:39,058
It's probably just as well
if that's your attitude.

1042
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:40,943
Yeah, it is my attitude.

1043
01:16:41,105 --> 01:16:45,303
Another thing: you're not going out
with Jim Roper and that's final!

1044
01:16:46,025 --> 01:16:49,415
- Final?
- Yes! That's final.

1045
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:52,537
Well, I wouldn't be too sure.

1046
01:16:52,705 --> 01:16:54,263
You go right along to Pennsylvania

1047
01:16:54,425 --> 01:16:58,213
and you play with your grimy coal
miners, but don't be too sure.

1048
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:35,139
Anything on that call to New York?

1049
01:17:35,305 --> 01:17:38,342
- Come in.
- Here you are, sir.

1050
01:17:38,505 --> 01:17:40,177
Keep trying, will you?

1051
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:44,423
- They're celebrating
the football game. - No kidding.

1052
01:17:44,585 --> 01:17:45,984
They play on Sunday?

1053
01:17:46,145 --> 01:17:49,342
Sure. Mountain City
beat the Steamrollers 28 to nothing.

1054
01:17:50,905 --> 01:17:52,224
Thanks.

1055
01:17:52,385 --> 01:17:55,502
Hey, you're that Providence left end.
I know you.

1056
01:17:55,665 --> 01:17:59,340
- Nope. Sorry.
- You played awful dirty.

1057
01:17:59,505 --> 01:18:02,577
You should have been thrown
out of the game.

1058
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:06,374
- I was. - No, you weren't,
but you should have been.

1059
01:18:07,305 --> 01:18:10,934
- You're cute.
- Come on in and join us.

1060
01:18:11,105 --> 01:18:13,573
I've got a couple of quarts.

1061
01:18:13,745 --> 01:18:17,215
- I'm in training.
- For what?

1062
01:18:17,385 --> 01:18:21,583
- I'll bet you're married.
- You're absolutely right.

1063
01:18:21,745 --> 01:18:24,862
- My wife gave a party today.
- She did?

1064
01:18:25,065 --> 01:18:27,863
- You know who was there?
- Who? - Not me.

1065
01:18:28,025 --> 01:18:31,540
Why don't we stay in here, then?

1066
01:18:31,705 --> 01:18:35,983
I bet you won't be sorry
'cause when I like a fella...

1067
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:40,537
- I hate to say no to a lady.
- Well, don't.

1068
01:18:40,705 --> 01:18:44,414
- But you got to beat it.
- What do you mean? I just got here.

1069
01:18:44,585 --> 01:18:48,658
- And you just went out.
- Well, luck to you, Buckley!

1070
01:18:53,105 --> 01:18:56,063
- Hello. Hello, Mary?
- Hello.

1071
01:18:56,225 --> 01:18:58,455
I've been calling all evening.

1072
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,456
Well, nobody was here.

1073
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,583
We all went to dinner
at Michel's after the party.

1074
01:19:03,745 --> 01:19:05,497
Who's"we"?

1075
01:19:06,665 --> 01:19:09,896
Peg and Bill, Sage and Steve
and Jim Roper and I.

1076
01:19:10,065 --> 01:19:13,375
- Who brought you home?
- Jim.

1077
01:19:13,545 --> 01:19:16,298
- How long did he stay?
- About half an hour.

1078
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:17,864
You going to see him again?

1079
01:19:18,025 --> 01:19:21,859
I don't know... Oh, yes. He'll be
at Peg and Bill's Friday for dinner.

1080
01:19:22,025 --> 01:19:24,823
Then he'll undoubtedly
bring you home.

1081
01:19:24,985 --> 01:19:26,703
Possibly. I don't know.

1082
01:19:27,545 --> 01:19:29,900
You know what you're doing,
don't you?

1083
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,625
Yes. I'm showing you
I won't stay cooped up

1084
01:19:32,785 --> 01:19:36,983
while you're free as a bird
all in the holy name of career.

1085
01:19:37,145 --> 01:19:39,864
Listen, I don't want that guy
in our apartment anymore.

1086
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:44,417
You tell him, or I'll come back
and tell him myself.

1087
01:19:44,585 --> 01:19:46,576
If I do, he'll have a tough time

1088
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:48,497
explaining a busted head
to his patients.

1089
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:51,980
Very well. I'll tell him.
Is that all?

1090
01:19:52,145 --> 01:19:54,739
Yeah, that's all.

1091
01:20:09,545 --> 01:20:12,821
You're not to come up here anymore.

1092
01:20:13,745 --> 01:20:16,339
People don't think
of this area as being cold.

1093
01:20:16,505 --> 01:20:20,134
We have readings
of 15, 18, 20 degrees below.

1094
01:20:20,305 --> 01:20:23,422
I'm glad you came in
to see me today, Mr Eaton.

1095
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,337
I'm not always as talkative as this.

1096
01:20:25,505 --> 01:20:28,144
Maybe that's because
I don't run across many...

1097
01:20:28,305 --> 01:20:29,863
who are willing to listen.

1098
01:20:30,065 --> 01:20:32,454
It's my pleasure, Mr Benziger.
I mean it.

1099
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:36,015
That's mighty nice of you.
Makes me feel poorly

1100
01:20:36,185 --> 01:20:39,177
about not being in the market
for any bonds right now.

1101
01:20:39,345 --> 01:20:42,337
I know how it is breaking in
a new territory.

1102
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,257
We've got good days and bad days.

1103
01:20:44,425 --> 01:20:46,655
This happens to be
one of my good ones.

1104
01:20:46,825 --> 01:20:50,181
Local folks tell me you've been
making a few inquiries about me.

1105
01:20:51,705 --> 01:20:53,343
Yes, sir. Alittle.

1106
01:20:53,505 --> 01:20:56,577
If you heard anything disgraceful,
it's probably true.

1107
01:20:56,745 --> 01:20:59,339
You down here all by yourself?

1108
01:21:00,185 --> 01:21:03,461
- Pretty lonesome town.
- My wife's back in New York.

1109
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:08,221
- Taking care of the kiddies, eh?
- No. No kiddies.

1110
01:21:10,105 --> 01:21:11,424
Excuse me.

1111
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:13,903
Yes?

1112
01:21:14,065 --> 01:21:15,384
Well, put her on.

1113
01:21:16,265 --> 01:21:18,301
Hello, Natalie.

1114
01:21:18,865 --> 01:21:24,656
Oh, let's see.
In about... 15 minutes.

1115
01:21:25,705 --> 01:21:27,935
Yeah, I will.
Oh, hold on a second.

1116
01:21:28,105 --> 01:21:30,858
You're alone.
Why don't you join us for dinner?

1117
01:21:31,025 --> 01:21:34,222
You won't get as good
a steak anywhere, I guarantee you.

1118
01:21:34,425 --> 01:21:36,655
- If that's an invitation, I'm sold.
- Good.

1119
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:38,383
Nat?

1120
01:21:38,545 --> 01:21:40,900
Tell Mother I'm bringing
a guest for dinner.

1121
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:42,464
I will.

1122
01:21:42,665 --> 01:21:44,144
Bye.

1123
01:21:56,865 --> 01:22:00,653
Quiet, Rocco, it's all right, yes.

1124
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,093
He can be pretty loud at times.

1125
01:22:04,265 --> 01:22:07,416
My wife and daughter
are alone a good deal at night.

1126
01:22:08,865 --> 01:22:12,141
- Hello, Dad. - Hi, Nat.
Natalie, this is Mr Eaton.

1127
01:22:12,305 --> 01:22:14,614
How do you do?

1128
01:22:14,785 --> 01:22:16,423
Won't you come in?

1129
01:22:21,585 --> 01:22:24,053
Oh, Dad.
Like the side of a matchbox.

1130
01:22:24,225 --> 01:22:26,864
Can't think why.
I shaved at 5:oothis morning.

1131
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,617
I'll take those, Mr Eaton.

1132
01:22:28,785 --> 01:22:32,300
They usually go under the stairs
but we're getting new shelves.

1133
01:22:32,465 --> 01:22:35,741
- You hear that, Dad?
- I heard. I know.

1134
01:22:35,905 --> 01:22:37,816
I haven't finished them yet.

1135
01:22:37,985 --> 01:22:42,376
This is the den, but as you see,
it's as much office as den.

1136
01:22:42,545 --> 01:22:45,503
- I'll go get Mother.
Be down in a minute. - Okay.

1137
01:23:03,585 --> 01:23:06,622
I'd never seen a mine
before last Monday.

1138
01:23:06,785 --> 01:23:09,618
- This one of yours?
- Yes. That's number four.

1139
01:23:09,825 --> 01:23:13,500
Dad wanted to call it the Natalie,
but he was overruled.

1140
01:23:13,705 --> 01:23:15,024
This one's number one.

1141
01:23:15,185 --> 01:23:18,302
It's the oldest, but
number four is our pride and joy.

1142
01:23:18,465 --> 01:23:21,457
When built, it was the most
electrified colliery in the world.

1143
01:23:24,305 --> 01:23:26,865
This is my favorite room
in the whole house.

1144
01:23:27,025 --> 01:23:29,380
I used to come here
and do my homework.

1145
01:23:29,545 --> 01:23:32,503
- Especially your arithmetic.
- Why do you say that?

1146
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:34,303
So your father could help you.

1147
01:23:34,465 --> 01:23:36,501
No. I was very good in arithmetic,

1148
01:23:36,665 --> 01:23:38,895
but he did help me
with everything else.

1149
01:23:39,065 --> 01:23:41,374
He'll help you
with a drink in a second.

1150
01:23:41,545 --> 01:23:45,015
- I'm in no hurry for one.
- Tell me something. - Yes?

1151
01:23:45,665 --> 01:23:48,304
How does it feel
to be someone like you,

1152
01:23:48,465 --> 01:23:50,456
blooming in a coal
town like this?

1153
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,661
Do you really want to know?

1154
01:23:52,825 --> 01:23:54,861
Well, I love it here.

1155
01:23:55,025 --> 01:23:57,858
When the mountains
are covered with laurel or snow,

1156
01:23:58,065 --> 01:24:00,021
there's something
so beautiful about them.

1157
01:24:00,185 --> 01:24:02,653
And the people, too.
The miners.

1158
01:24:02,825 --> 01:24:04,622
The old ones, not the young.

1159
01:24:04,785 --> 01:24:08,778
I've been in so many of their homes.
Not much time left to them.

1160
01:24:08,945 --> 01:24:11,982
Not much to show
for working hard all their lives,

1161
01:24:12,185 --> 01:24:16,815
yet they have such
dignity and wisdom, sorrow and pride.

1162
01:24:20,065 --> 01:24:21,783
Oh, Mother, this is Mr Eaton.

1163
01:24:21,945 --> 01:24:24,539
Good evening.
It's nice of you to come.

1164
01:24:24,705 --> 01:24:26,263
You're kind to have me.

1165
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:28,655
Why is everyone standing around?
Let's have a drink.

1166
01:24:28,865 --> 01:24:31,095
- Nothing for me, dear.
- Nor me, Dad.

1167
01:24:31,265 --> 01:24:33,335
What's wrong with you people?
Mr Eaton?

1168
01:24:33,505 --> 01:24:35,541
- Straight scotch is fine.
- That's my boy.

1169
01:24:35,705 --> 01:24:39,141
Only one drink now.
We don't want ours teak ruined.

1170
01:24:41,985 --> 01:24:45,136
Welcome to our city.
Welcome to our home.

1171
01:24:45,305 --> 01:24:47,614
And all that's beautiful in it.

1172
01:24:47,785 --> 01:24:51,664
I guess we live closer
to basic instincts here

1173
01:24:51,825 --> 01:24:54,020
than some other regions
I could name.

1174
01:24:55,545 --> 01:24:59,060
These miners
are a pretty hard-bitten lot.

1175
01:25:00,585 --> 01:25:03,224
Sometimes they start home
a little drunk,

1176
01:25:03,385 --> 01:25:07,822
fall down an air shaft,
get bitten by a rattlesnake,

1177
01:25:08,825 --> 01:25:10,861
drown in a dam.

1178
01:25:11,025 --> 01:25:14,859
Yet I have to say
I can't blame the men...

1179
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:21,261
Goodness, I had no idea.
Well, I can finish this tomorrow.

1180
01:25:21,425 --> 01:25:24,303
- Coming to bed?
- Maybe I'm a softie

1181
01:25:24,465 --> 01:25:27,059
baby the men too much, but...

1182
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:31,342
- Good night, Mr Eaton.
- Good night. Thank you very much.

1183
01:25:31,505 --> 01:25:33,223
We enjoyed having you.

1184
01:25:33,385 --> 01:25:35,580
I might as well say good night, too.

1185
01:25:35,785 --> 01:25:38,822
Nat, would you keep
Mr Eaton company for a minute?

1186
01:25:50,505 --> 01:25:54,498
Mother has a heart condition.
She never stays up later than 1o: oo.

1187
01:25:54,665 --> 01:25:56,974
What do you do with your time

1188
01:25:57,185 --> 01:26:00,541
or do you have
a heart condition, too?

1189
01:26:00,705 --> 01:26:04,823
No, I have no particular
heart condition of either kind.

1190
01:26:04,985 --> 01:26:09,854
I do wel fare work, gardening,
go to the movies... The usual.

1191
01:26:10,025 --> 01:26:13,381
- Would you go to the movies
with me sometime? - No.

1192
01:26:13,545 --> 01:26:15,501
'Cause I'm married?

1193
01:26:15,705 --> 01:26:18,583
That's a pretty good reason
at least in Mountain City.

1194
01:26:18,745 --> 01:26:21,543
How about going to the movies
with me in Philadelphia?

1195
01:26:21,745 --> 01:26:26,182
Mr Eaton,
you probably have a very nice wife.

1196
01:26:27,065 --> 01:26:30,580
I suppose you're angry
because I asked you.

1197
01:26:32,065 --> 01:26:35,694
- No. I consider it a compliment.
- I hope you do.

1198
01:26:35,865 --> 01:26:39,540
You're the first person I've asked
out since I've been married.

1199
01:26:39,705 --> 01:26:42,094
- Thank you.
- There's some other things...

1200
01:26:42,265 --> 01:26:45,302
I really don't want to encourage
this conversation.

1201
01:26:47,105 --> 01:26:49,539
- Mother all right, Dad?
- Oh, yes.

1202
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:53,254
I had some things to tell her.
I won't be seeing her in the morning.

1203
01:26:54,865 --> 01:26:56,981
I guess I'll be wandering along.

1204
01:26:57,145 --> 01:27:00,103
Natalie's having some people
for dinner Saturday.

1205
01:27:00,265 --> 01:27:01,983
It'd be nice if you came, too.

1206
01:27:02,145 --> 01:27:04,375
I don't think Mr Eaton
would enjoy himself.

1207
01:27:04,545 --> 01:27:06,137
It's just our bridge club.

1208
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:09,854
- I'll take a rain check.
Another time. - That would be better.

1209
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:13,301
All right, but we hope you'll come, back for dinner
sometime.

1210
01:27:13,465 --> 01:27:15,103
- Good night.
- Good night.

1211
01:27:19,225 --> 01:27:21,261
- Good night.
- Good night.

1212
01:27:58,145 --> 01:27:59,294
Hello.

1213
01:27:59,825 --> 01:28:01,497
Hello.

1214
01:28:03,785 --> 01:28:07,255
Natalie?
I was just thinking about you.

1215
01:28:07,425 --> 01:28:09,620
What were you thinking?

1216
01:28:11,145 --> 01:28:13,215
I'm glad you did the right thing.

1217
01:28:13,425 --> 01:28:19,136
You said no and turned me out
into the cold and lonely night.

1218
01:28:19,305 --> 01:28:20,658
Don't.

1219
01:28:20,825 --> 01:28:23,623
You saved me
from making a big mistake.

1220
01:28:26,345 --> 01:28:30,054
Maybe it was I who made the mistake.

1221
01:28:30,225 --> 01:28:32,022
What do you mean?

1222
01:28:33,145 --> 01:28:35,056
I don't know.

1223
01:28:35,225 --> 01:28:37,341
I'm not sure. Are you?

1224
01:28:38,305 --> 01:28:39,738
No.

1225
01:28:41,225 --> 01:28:44,581
There's a drive-in movie
just outside of town.

1226
01:28:44,745 --> 01:28:48,863
- The last show starts at 9:30.
- Yes?

1227
01:28:51,385 --> 01:28:55,742
- Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night.

1228
01:28:55,905 --> 01:28:59,978
The last row of cars.
A yellow Plymouth convertible,

1229
01:29:00,185 --> 01:29:02,540
slightly covered with coal dust.

1230
01:29:04,345 --> 01:29:06,495
We're probably making a big mistake.

1231
01:29:06,665 --> 01:29:08,815
You know that, don't you?

1232
01:29:09,945 --> 01:29:11,776
Yes.

1233
01:29:13,985 --> 01:29:15,657
I know.

1234
01:29:17,905 --> 01:29:19,099
Good night.

1235
01:29:21,265 --> 01:29:23,062
Good night.

1236
01:30:08,545 --> 01:30:10,979
- Hello.
- Hello.

1237
01:30:38,545 --> 01:30:41,105
I guess we're the only two people
watching the movie.

1238
01:30:44,465 --> 01:30:46,296
- You know something?
- What?

1239
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:48,860
I don't even know your first name.

1240
01:30:49,025 --> 01:30:52,097
Actually, it's David.
David Alfred Eaton.

1241
01:30:53,025 --> 01:30:55,539
See, I liked David,
and my father liked Alfred,

1242
01:30:55,705 --> 01:30:58,219
so it was Alfred.
- May I call you David?

1243
01:30:58,385 --> 01:31:00,103
If you like.

1244
01:31:12,105 --> 01:31:15,336
- Do you believe in love
at first sight? - No.

1245
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:20,823
- Neither do I.
- I believe in confusion.

1246
01:31:22,985 --> 01:31:24,259
Yes.

1247
01:31:24,425 --> 01:31:28,703
Aman walks around in a desert
all his life looking for water.

1248
01:31:28,865 --> 01:31:30,935
All he ever finds is sand.

1249
01:31:31,105 --> 01:31:33,665
I didn't know you were
lost in the desert.

1250
01:31:33,825 --> 01:31:37,135
I didn't know it either
until last night.

1251
01:31:37,305 --> 01:31:39,694
I walked into a house
where there was warmth

1252
01:31:39,865 --> 01:31:42,663
that didn't come from radiators.

1253
01:31:42,825 --> 01:31:45,658
I saw your mother and father,
and I saw you.

1254
01:31:45,825 --> 01:31:48,578
You're lonely.
You're away from home, that's all.

1255
01:31:50,825 --> 01:31:55,455
No. In one evening
my whole life seemed to change.

1256
01:31:56,945 --> 01:32:00,574
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but you made me feel

1257
01:32:00,745 --> 01:32:04,897
like I'd been cheated
out of something all my life.

1258
01:32:06,665 --> 01:32:08,303
It's funny...

1259
01:32:08,465 --> 01:32:12,856
That movie out there doesn't seem
so bad with the sound turned off.

1260
01:32:13,025 --> 01:32:15,334
In other words,
you'd like me to shut up.

1261
01:32:15,505 --> 01:32:18,178
No. I'd like you to do
much more than that.

1262
01:32:40,745 --> 01:32:44,260
Now you've got me
lost in the desert.

1263
01:32:44,465 --> 01:32:48,253
I guess we're all out here,
searching.

1264
01:32:51,545 --> 01:32:53,456
Even your wife?

1265
01:33:05,025 --> 01:33:09,018
I didn't sleep very well
last night after I left you

1266
01:33:09,185 --> 01:33:12,621
and now many things
seem clearer to me.

1267
01:33:12,785 --> 01:33:15,618
I don't know if you're
still in love with your wife,

1268
01:33:15,825 --> 01:33:20,103
but I do know that you haven't
given up on your marriage.

1269
01:33:20,265 --> 01:33:24,656
I know if we stop now,
we'll never do injury to anyone

1270
01:33:24,825 --> 01:33:26,497
except possibly ourselves.

1271
01:33:26,665 --> 01:33:31,659
I want to say goodbye,
but not in a letter.

1272
01:33:31,825 --> 01:33:35,818
So I'll have to see you
one last time.

1273
01:34:09,945 --> 01:34:11,981
- Sure it's all right?
- What?

1274
01:34:12,185 --> 01:34:16,019
Oh, I don't know. Our cars
being parked so close together?

1275
01:34:16,185 --> 01:34:19,177
Nobody uses this road.

1276
01:34:19,345 --> 01:34:24,135
In fact, nobody knows this place
except wild rabbits and squirrels,

1277
01:34:24,345 --> 01:34:29,578
chipmunks and field mice,
and birds and butterflies and...

1278
01:34:30,585 --> 01:34:33,497
- Falling leaves.
- Which one of those are you?

1279
01:34:33,705 --> 01:34:36,503
I don't know.
Asquirrel, perhaps, or...

1280
01:34:38,745 --> 01:34:41,020
Maybe just a coward.

1281
01:34:50,265 --> 01:34:52,017
I saved your letter.

1282
01:34:53,265 --> 01:34:56,337
- You know, I realize
something now, David. - What?

1283
01:34:57,665 --> 01:35:00,577
It was the proper way to say goodbye.

1284
01:35:01,705 --> 01:35:03,855
- The only way.
- Natalie.

1285
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:06,135
- Yes?
- Look at me.

1286
01:35:09,865 --> 01:35:11,617
You know something?

1287
01:35:14,025 --> 01:35:16,983
Even if we never
see each other again,

1288
01:35:17,145 --> 01:35:19,898
something very good
has happened,

1289
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,298
'cause you'll know
for the rest of your life that...

1290
01:35:25,465 --> 01:35:27,262
Just the sight of you...

1291
01:35:28,385 --> 01:35:31,263
Just the sound of your voice

1292
01:35:32,145 --> 01:35:35,581
created a feeling in me
that was so strong

1293
01:35:35,745 --> 01:35:39,863
that I couldn't treat it
as polite conversation

1294
01:35:41,065 --> 01:35:42,623
or with silence.

1295
01:35:42,985 --> 01:35:45,021
And I...

1296
01:35:45,185 --> 01:35:50,100
I'll always remember a sad, lonely,

1297
01:35:50,265 --> 01:35:52,221
searching young man,

1298
01:35:52,385 --> 01:35:55,980
who passed through my life
for a brief moment.

1299
01:35:58,585 --> 01:36:00,940
And I loved his sadness,

1300
01:36:03,265 --> 01:36:05,096
his loneliness,

1301
01:36:06,305 --> 01:36:07,977
his searching.

1302
01:36:15,865 --> 01:36:17,821
Please don't.

1303
01:36:31,865 --> 01:36:33,935
Well, I'll make it easier.

1304
01:36:35,265 --> 01:36:38,337
I'm leaving here. I'm going back
to New York tonight.

1305
01:36:39,705 --> 01:36:44,017
In three weeks,
I accomplished all I set out to...

1306
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:46,778
More than I intended.

1307
01:36:46,945 --> 01:36:50,381
Will we be writing to each other?

1308
01:36:50,545 --> 01:36:53,776
- What do you think?
- No.

1309
01:36:54,945 --> 01:36:56,173
Of course not.

1310
01:37:51,505 --> 01:37:53,257
Welcome back.

1311
01:37:54,305 --> 01:37:56,660
- I ordered for both of us.
- Fine.

1312
01:37:57,425 --> 01:38:01,896
I haven't studied your report,
but I did glance through it briefly.

1313
01:38:02,065 --> 01:38:03,339
Its thoroughness convinced me,

1314
01:38:03,505 --> 01:38:07,544
that I've no reason to be displeased
with you for coming back so soon.

1315
01:38:07,705 --> 01:38:09,457
You did what was expected of you.

1316
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:13,300
I'm glad you agreed about Benziger.
Fine man.

1317
01:38:13,505 --> 01:38:16,258
However, that's not
what I wanted to talk about.

1318
01:38:16,425 --> 01:38:18,177
We don't want to be disturbed.

1319
01:38:22,425 --> 01:38:25,735
I'll get right to the point.
Have you seen your wife,

1320
01:38:25,905 --> 01:38:28,703
or did you come here directly
from Mountain City?

1321
01:38:28,865 --> 01:38:31,857
Mary? No.
I got home last night.

1322
01:38:32,025 --> 01:38:33,936
She was still out on Long Island

1323
01:38:34,105 --> 01:38:36,380
and she hadn't returned
when I left this morning.

1324
01:38:36,545 --> 01:38:39,503
May I assume you're aware
of trouble in your home?

1325
01:38:39,665 --> 01:38:41,974
Would you care to be more specific?

1326
01:38:42,145 --> 01:38:46,980
Well, now, you see
our Mr Hasbrouck

1327
01:38:47,145 --> 01:38:50,820
who, as you know, has nothing
but the highest regard for you

1328
01:38:50,985 --> 01:38:53,419
happens to live in Westport,
Connecticut.

1329
01:38:53,585 --> 01:38:55,177
So it was inevitable

1330
01:38:55,345 --> 01:38:58,576
he should hear about your wife's
presence at the home of a neighbor:

1331
01:38:58,745 --> 01:39:00,781
MrAnd Mrs Joseph Cash.

1332
01:39:00,985 --> 01:39:03,943
- Cash? I don't know them.
- No, you don't.

1333
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,175
But Dr. James Roper does,

1334
01:39:06,345 --> 01:39:09,974
and it was there that he spent last
weekend with your wife

1335
01:39:10,145 --> 01:39:13,581
after the Princeton-Yale
football game.

1336
01:39:13,825 --> 01:39:16,703
You have my word,
or Mr. Hasbrouck's word,

1337
01:39:16,865 --> 01:39:18,662
that that particular
host and hostess

1338
01:39:18,825 --> 01:39:21,578
make a practice of having
a houseful of guests every weekend

1339
01:39:21,745 --> 01:39:24,179
the attraction being
that there'll be no checking

1340
01:39:24,345 --> 01:39:26,620
on who sleeps in which room.

1341
01:39:34,785 --> 01:39:37,015
Aren't you jumping to conclusions?

1342
01:39:37,185 --> 01:39:39,983
I can assure you
that Mr Hasbrouck made quite certain

1343
01:39:40,145 --> 01:39:42,454
your wife's affair
was an open secret

1344
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:44,980
before he invited
Eugene St. John to lunch.

1345
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:48,455
- Eugene St. John?
- Their talk was most informal.

1346
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:51,537
St. John agreed
to take no action right now,

1347
01:39:51,705 --> 01:39:53,696
but he promised to speak
to his daughter

1348
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:56,294
when you decided
it was necessary or advisable

1349
01:39:56,465 --> 01:39:58,854
and that is where the matter stands.

1350
01:39:59,025 --> 01:40:01,539
That's not where the matter stands
where I'm concerned.

1351
01:40:01,705 --> 01:40:04,173
It's none of this firm's business
what my wife does.

1352
01:40:04,345 --> 01:40:07,940
I'm surprised Mr St. John didn't tell
Percy Hasbrouck to go to the devil.

1353
01:40:08,105 --> 01:40:11,017
He probably realized
what's good for your future

1354
01:40:11,185 --> 01:40:12,982
is good for his daughter's.

1355
01:40:13,145 --> 01:40:16,137
If there's anything
that he, I, or anyone can do

1356
01:40:16,305 --> 01:40:20,218
to save your marriage he's forit.
- What if I don't want to save it?

1357
01:40:20,385 --> 01:40:23,661
Then we've failed.
Then you have failed, Eaton.

1358
01:40:23,825 --> 01:40:27,613
Divorce is a damnable thing.
It violates good order.

1359
01:40:27,785 --> 01:40:30,777
- It's a threat to good order.
- Isn't it just possible

1360
01:40:30,945 --> 01:40:33,334
that infidelity might be
grounds for a divorce?

1361
01:40:33,505 --> 01:40:37,180
There are no grounds for divorce.
If you want my personal theology

1362
01:40:37,345 --> 01:40:38,983
infidelity is the lesser sin.

1363
01:40:39,145 --> 01:40:41,534
I'd do anything in my power
to prevent a divorce.

1364
01:40:41,705 --> 01:40:43,855
Including condoning infidelity?

1365
01:40:44,065 --> 01:40:46,625
I consider your word
"condon" disrespectful.

1366
01:40:46,785 --> 01:40:49,345
I condone none of it.
The problem of infidelity

1367
01:40:49,505 --> 01:40:51,860
is between husband
and wife and God.

1368
01:40:52,025 --> 01:40:55,256
The problem of divorce
concerns the whole of civilization.

1369
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:59,100
What is marriage?
An exchange of vows, a contract.

1370
01:40:59,265 --> 01:41:02,894
It is my duty to myself
and to any man working for me

1371
01:41:03,065 --> 01:41:05,818
to demand that he honor
all his contracts.

1372
01:41:05,985 --> 01:41:09,057
When you came here you found out
we always honor our word

1373
01:41:09,225 --> 01:41:11,136
even if it means taking a loss.

1374
01:41:11,305 --> 01:41:13,296
This is the first
opportunity you've had

1375
01:41:13,465 --> 01:41:17,617
of putting yourself to our test.
- And if I don't meet your test?

1376
01:41:17,785 --> 01:41:20,663
You've worked hard and well, Eaton.

1377
01:41:20,865 --> 01:41:23,937
You have a fine,
hard-earned record with us.

1378
01:41:24,105 --> 01:41:26,665
You can't afford
to throw that away.

1379
01:41:26,825 --> 01:41:29,498
I can afford to do as I please.

1380
01:41:29,665 --> 01:41:31,621
And I say with all due respect

1381
01:41:31,785 --> 01:41:34,174
that you can afford
nothing of the kind.

1382
01:41:36,505 --> 01:41:38,894
I wasn't going to tell you this.

1383
01:41:39,065 --> 01:41:42,023
I didn't want it to form
part of your decision,

1384
01:41:42,225 --> 01:41:45,217
but I like you, Eaton,
and I don't want to lose you.

1385
01:41:45,385 --> 01:41:48,900
Only you and I will know that
I mentioned it at this early date.

1386
01:41:49,065 --> 01:41:51,818
- Mentioned what?
- The roll-top desk.

1387
01:41:51,985 --> 01:41:53,816
The partnership.

1388
01:41:53,985 --> 01:41:56,977
I've had discussions
with the board

1389
01:41:57,145 --> 01:41:58,976
and it's only a question of time

1390
01:41:59,145 --> 01:42:02,820
and much less now
than you might suppose.

1391
01:42:08,465 --> 01:42:13,016
Stay where you are, son.
You've a lot of thinking to do.

1392
01:42:13,225 --> 01:42:16,900
But don't do it all now.
You've had a bad time.

1393
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:40,335
Well, you're back.

1394
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:45,733
- Was the trip successful?
- Yeah.

1395
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:49,416
Are you back for good
or is this just a visit?

1396
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,013
For good.

1397
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,256
Finished up sooner
than you expected?

1398
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:58,219
Sooner than you expected, too.

1399
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:01,531
Now that I'm back you'll have to
start behaving yourself.

1400
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,292
Did you say start?

1401
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:06,213
I know all about you
and Roper at the Cashes'.

1402
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,496
I could subpoena everybody
that was up there...

1403
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:10,855
and divorce you in New York state.

1404
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:14,171
But you won't because Mr MacHardie
wouldn't like that.

1405
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:17,332
You think you're pretty
clever, but you're not.

1406
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,013
You flaunted your affair publicly.

1407
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,740
I don't like a wife
thumbing her nose at me.

1408
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:24,653
And I don't like having a husband
who isn't a husband.

1409
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:27,618
- What do you think you're doing?
- What does it look like?

1410
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:30,931
What do you expect me to do,
enter a convent?

1411
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:34,456
I'm sure you'll find yourself
a woman, if you haven't already.

1412
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:36,178
You just better be careful.

1413
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:39,571
You'd better be able to explain
every minute of your time.

1414
01:43:39,740 --> 01:43:40,855
Or you'll do what?

1415
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:43,215
I'll put you where
you're afraid of landing

1416
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:46,611
in the tabloids, page one, two,
or three. Take your choice!

1417
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:51,578
I know why you're
doing this to me!

1418
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:53,970
It's not our marriage
you're trying to hold together.

1419
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:57,735
It's your own sick dream
of 5 million before you're 40!

1420
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:01,256
Be the big man,
bigger than your father!

1421
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:09,856
Mr Eaton, will you go directly into
the partners' room, please?

1422
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:13,697
Mr Duffy, please go directly
into the partners' room.

1423
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:27,603
Creighton, come in.

1424
01:44:31,645 --> 01:44:33,840
Alfred, come in and sit down.

1425
01:44:35,845 --> 01:44:40,157
Now, we've been having a go
at the Nassau proposal

1426
01:44:41,165 --> 01:44:43,884
and we've been taking
under consideration

1427
01:44:44,045 --> 01:44:47,924
Nassau's request that we underwrite
a common-stock issue

1428
01:44:48,085 --> 01:44:50,440
to finance a plant expansion.

1429
01:44:50,605 --> 01:44:52,835
Nassau obviously wants to expand,

1430
01:44:53,005 --> 01:44:55,121
because they expect
to land a sizable contract

1431
01:44:55,285 --> 01:44:58,675
to manufacture their new
E1-FX plane for the navy

1432
01:44:58,845 --> 01:45:01,962
and it behooves us
to look into this E1-FX

1433
01:45:02,125 --> 01:45:04,844
to see how good an aircraft it is

1434
01:45:05,005 --> 01:45:08,600
before we commit MacHardie
and Company to getting involved.

1435
01:45:08,765 --> 01:45:12,440
Sir, isn't the United States Navy's
interest in the planes

1436
01:45:12,605 --> 01:45:14,357
sufficient endorsement for us?

1437
01:45:14,525 --> 01:45:17,995
Ordinarily it should be,
but in this case

1438
01:45:18,165 --> 01:45:21,874
my sixth sense tells me
that we ought at least to conduct

1439
01:45:22,045 --> 01:45:26,163
a routine investigation of the E1-FX
before under writing the venture,

1440
01:45:26,325 --> 01:45:30,682
particularly as we have on our team
a man so well qualified to do it.

1441
01:45:30,885 --> 01:45:34,514
Alfred, you're not only a personal
friend of Alexander Porter,

1442
01:45:34,725 --> 01:45:36,681
but you were associated with NAC

1443
01:45:36,845 --> 01:45:38,801
in the days before it
rose to prominence

1444
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:41,115
in the aircraft
manufacturing field.

1445
01:45:41,325 --> 01:45:43,600
Some people seem to think
my departure from Nassau

1446
01:45:43,765 --> 01:45:45,915
marked the beginning of its rise.

1447
01:45:47,605 --> 01:45:50,597
Wouldn't we be placing Mr. Eaton
in a rather embarrassing position

1448
01:45:50,765 --> 01:45:54,644
by asking him to attempt
to exercise impartial judgment

1449
01:45:54,805 --> 01:45:58,002
where his close friend
Mr Porter is concerned?

1450
01:45:58,205 --> 01:46:01,277
And who would you recommend
for the job, Creighton?

1451
01:46:02,485 --> 01:46:05,636
Well, sir, in as much as
I brought this venture

1452
01:46:05,805 --> 01:46:08,558
to the firm's attention
and in as much as I'm familiar

1453
01:46:08,725 --> 01:46:10,078
with all of its ramifications...

1454
01:46:10,245 --> 01:46:13,840
I have every confidence
in Mr Eaton's judgment and loyalty.

1455
01:46:14,045 --> 01:46:17,754
Alfred, how long will it take you
to get this underway?

1456
01:46:17,925 --> 01:46:20,917
By a fortunate coincidence,
Mrs Eaton and I

1457
01:46:21,085 --> 01:46:24,077
will be at Mr. Porter's table
at a charity ball Saturday.

1458
01:46:24,245 --> 01:46:28,158
There's no rule saying a man can't
take advantage of his host, is there?

1459
01:46:32,245 --> 01:46:35,555
I'd like to say I'm close
to everything that goes on at Nassau,

1460
01:46:35,765 --> 01:46:39,963
but I'm just the titular head.
If you'll pardon the expression.

1461
01:46:40,125 --> 01:46:41,683
Thanks to Uncle Fritz' money

1462
01:46:41,845 --> 01:46:44,643
I reap the dividends,
the profits, and the credit.

1463
01:46:44,805 --> 01:46:46,204
Yes, thanks.

1464
01:46:46,365 --> 01:46:49,596
Von Elm's the real brains. He'll give
you all the facts you need.

1465
01:46:49,765 --> 01:46:53,474
- Can you set it up? - I'll see you
get the run of the place.

1466
01:46:53,725 --> 01:46:54,919
Thanks.

1467
01:46:56,405 --> 01:47:00,444
- Can I ask you a corny question?
- If you don't mind a corny answer.

1468
01:47:00,605 --> 01:47:03,802
Are you getting anything out
of yoursuccess besides more success?

1469
01:47:05,165 --> 01:47:07,679
Why don't you say what you mean?

1470
01:47:07,845 --> 01:47:11,042
- All right. Let'stalk about Mary.
- Nothing to talk about.

1471
01:47:11,205 --> 01:47:13,082
Things any better?

1472
01:47:13,725 --> 01:47:17,035
They're not any worse.
They'll never get any better.

1473
01:47:17,285 --> 01:47:20,357
- I'm not interested.
- I'm not good enough for you?

1474
01:47:20,525 --> 01:47:21,878
You might say that.

1475
01:47:22,045 --> 01:47:24,684
You won't be the first dissatisfied
wife I've made happy.

1476
01:47:24,845 --> 01:47:27,075
I'd like to go back to the table.

1477
01:47:27,245 --> 01:47:30,601
He doesn't even know you're alive
what perfume you're wearing

1478
01:47:30,765 --> 01:47:33,962
or how gorgeous you are.
Everyone knows it. So do you.

1479
01:47:34,125 --> 01:47:37,720
- Let go of me, please.
- Don't act. I know all about you.

1480
01:47:37,885 --> 01:47:39,557
Do you?

1481
01:47:42,965 --> 01:47:44,956
Alfred, would you take me home,
please?

1482
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,400
I thought you were
having a merry old time.

1483
01:47:47,565 --> 01:47:50,079
- Good night. it was delightful.
- Good night, princess.

1484
01:47:50,245 --> 01:47:53,078
- you were a charming host.
- But corny?

1485
01:47:58,565 --> 01:48:00,635
- Get my car, please.
- Yes, sir.

1486
01:48:18,965 --> 01:48:21,559
- Hello, Natalie.
- Hello.

1487
01:48:22,165 --> 01:48:24,042
It's nice to see you again.

1488
01:48:25,365 --> 01:48:28,516
Do you know my wife Mary?
Natalie Benziger.

1489
01:48:28,685 --> 01:48:31,563
- How do you do, Mrs Eaton?
- Hello, miss Benziger.

1490
01:48:31,725 --> 01:48:35,513
- What brings you to New York?
- a little shopping expedition.

1491
01:48:35,685 --> 01:48:37,277
Are you here with your mother?

1492
01:48:37,445 --> 01:48:40,323
No. With a friend: Mrs English.
Caroline English.

1493
01:48:40,485 --> 01:48:43,318
- How's your father?
- He's fine, thank you.

1494
01:48:43,885 --> 01:48:46,558
Where did you two know each other
in Philadelphia?

1495
01:48:46,725 --> 01:48:49,080
I tried to sell
Natalie's father some bonds

1496
01:48:49,245 --> 01:48:51,998
that time
when I was down in Mountain City.

1497
01:48:52,165 --> 01:48:56,443
- In Pennsylvania, remember?
- Yes, I remember.

1498
01:48:57,685 --> 01:49:02,042
Well, good night, Mrs Eaton.
It's very nice meeting you.

1499
01:49:02,205 --> 01:49:03,923
- Good night, Natalie.
- Good night.

1500
01:49:26,765 --> 01:49:30,519
Well, and what does she call you?

1501
01:49:32,565 --> 01:49:34,795
Miss Benziger.

1502
01:49:35,405 --> 01:49:39,364
She calls me Mrs Eaton
and you call her Natalie,

1503
01:49:39,525 --> 01:49:43,598
but she doesn't call you anything.
Aren't you Mr Eaton or Alfred?

1504
01:49:44,325 --> 01:49:46,475
As a matter of fact,
I'm Calvin Coolidge,

1505
01:49:46,645 --> 01:49:48,840
but she doesn't know that.

1506
01:49:50,165 --> 01:49:52,918
She's really quite lovely, you know.

1507
01:49:54,205 --> 01:49:58,039
- And you know me. I like men.
- So I'm told.

1508
01:49:59,685 --> 01:50:03,155
When she's that lovely,
I find it hard to hate her.

1509
01:50:04,005 --> 01:50:06,473
- I think you were lucky.
- I was?

1510
01:50:06,645 --> 01:50:10,354
Yes.
She has something I haven't got...

1511
01:50:11,325 --> 01:50:13,043
Niceness.

1512
01:50:14,205 --> 01:50:17,641
- But then I have something
she hasn't got. - Me?

1513
01:50:18,125 --> 01:50:21,435
No. Honesty and guts.

1514
01:50:21,605 --> 01:50:23,835
She has no guts.

1515
01:50:30,685 --> 01:50:32,357
What are you doing?

1516
01:50:32,525 --> 01:50:36,200
Don't worry. I'm not calling
your girl friend. I don't have to.

1517
01:50:39,045 --> 01:50:41,320
Dr Roper, please.

1518
01:50:45,045 --> 01:50:46,842
Hello, Jim?

1519
01:50:47,725 --> 01:50:49,443
Remember me?

1520
01:50:51,245 --> 01:50:52,917
Exactly.

1521
01:50:53,405 --> 01:50:56,636
Look,
why don't we have dinner sometime?

1522
01:50:58,325 --> 01:51:00,316
Tomorrow night?

1523
01:51:01,365 --> 01:51:03,117
Aren't I, though?

1524
01:51:04,005 --> 01:51:06,473
Fine. I'll meet you at your place.

1525
01:51:07,525 --> 01:51:09,243
Marvelous.

1526
01:51:13,165 --> 01:51:15,201
Any objections?

1527
01:51:17,925 --> 01:51:22,441
I have no facts and no evidence,
so this is what I'm going to do.

1528
01:51:22,605 --> 01:51:25,244
- It's all I can do.
- Just like that?

1529
01:51:25,445 --> 01:51:27,675
Yes, just like that.

1530
01:51:32,045 --> 01:51:36,004
I let you talk to foremen, designers,
mechanics, public relations men.

1531
01:51:36,165 --> 01:51:38,121
Everybody but the test pilot.

1532
01:51:39,445 --> 01:51:41,436
I'm sure
they told you everything they know.

1533
01:51:41,605 --> 01:51:43,641
They were instructed
to be cooperative.

1534
01:51:43,805 --> 01:51:46,399
I'll bet they were.
Everybody's been very helpful.

1535
01:51:46,565 --> 01:51:50,319
E1-FX is the greatest plane to ever
sprout wings. Maybe it can fly, too.

1536
01:51:50,485 --> 01:51:54,763
- What am I supposed to say?
- I don't want you to say anything.

1537
01:51:54,965 --> 01:51:58,560
Before I go back to Wall Street
and report the failure of a mission,

1538
01:51:58,725 --> 01:52:01,956
I'll give you one hour
to produce this test pilot

1539
01:52:02,125 --> 01:52:05,003
that's been so mysteriously busy.
- Suppose I can't find him.

1540
01:52:05,165 --> 01:52:07,076
Then you're in the wrong business.

1541
01:52:07,245 --> 01:52:11,079
- Don't think that won't be
in my report, too. - Wait a minute.

1542
01:52:12,285 --> 01:52:14,674
- Get Kelly In here.
- Yes, sir.

1543
01:52:14,845 --> 01:52:17,075
If somebody like me
didn't know you well,

1544
01:52:17,245 --> 01:52:19,315
they'd figure you to walk in here

1545
01:52:19,485 --> 01:52:21,521
with a whole set of prejudices
against us.

1546
01:52:21,685 --> 01:52:23,676
You left this company
when it was nothing

1547
01:52:23,845 --> 01:52:25,881
because you thought
it would always be nothing.

1548
01:52:26,045 --> 01:52:28,957
I'm glad I'm known so well
by somebody like you.

1549
01:52:29,845 --> 01:52:30,960
Come in.

1550
01:52:31,125 --> 01:52:32,763
You sent for me, sir?

1551
01:52:32,925 --> 01:52:35,439
This is Jerry Kelly, our test pilot.

1552
01:52:35,845 --> 01:52:40,361
- I think Mr Kelly And I will take
a walk. - What do you mean, a walk?

1553
01:52:40,525 --> 01:52:43,801
That's where you put one foot
in front of the other.

1554
01:53:04,605 --> 01:53:06,755
All the time we've wasted.

1555
01:53:07,445 --> 01:53:09,561
I'll make it up to you.

1556
01:53:10,765 --> 01:53:12,756
I intend to make you do that.

1557
01:53:13,605 --> 01:53:17,757
Every time I'm with you this way
I get the strangest feeling.

1558
01:53:18,565 --> 01:53:22,080
- Well, I'm a strange man.
- Are you?

1559
01:53:23,285 --> 01:53:27,039
- And you're a strange woman.
- How am I strange?

1560
01:53:27,565 --> 01:53:30,318
- Haven't you discovered that yet?
- No.

1561
01:53:31,405 --> 01:53:33,441
Well, I'll let you find out.

1562
01:53:38,285 --> 01:53:39,957
Jim.

1563
01:53:41,045 --> 01:53:42,876
Do you love me?

1564
01:53:43,925 --> 01:53:45,438
Love you?

1565
01:53:46,565 --> 01:53:48,840
Honey, I adore you

1566
01:53:49,485 --> 01:53:52,716
but I don't believe in love
any more than you do.

1567
01:53:52,885 --> 01:53:56,002
I believe in you wanting me
and me wanting you.

1568
01:53:56,165 --> 01:54:00,397
That's what brings you here and
that's what will keep us together.

1569
01:54:06,805 --> 01:54:10,275
Then I don't suppose
there's any sense

1570
01:54:10,445 --> 01:54:14,916
in us talking about marriage
or even thinking about it.

1571
01:54:18,845 --> 01:54:24,715
Look, let's have no more talk about
love or eternal devotion, shall we?

1572
01:54:26,645 --> 01:54:28,397
Jim!

1573
01:54:28,565 --> 01:54:31,477
Want me.
Please want me.

1574
01:54:48,765 --> 01:54:53,680
Oh, David... The first real thing
in a whole long year.

1575
01:54:54,325 --> 01:54:55,838
I had to see you again.

1576
01:54:56,045 --> 01:54:58,081
This is really why
I came to New York.

1577
01:55:02,765 --> 01:55:05,233
Well, I'm glad you did.

1578
01:55:10,845 --> 01:55:12,483
I've been wondering...

1579
01:55:12,965 --> 01:55:15,354
Wondering about so many things.

1580
01:55:15,525 --> 01:55:17,755
- you have?
- Yes.

1581
01:55:18,845 --> 01:55:22,758
Your wife, she's lovelier
than I thought she'd be.

1582
01:55:24,445 --> 01:55:26,242
And you're still with her,
aren't you?

1583
01:55:27,685 --> 01:55:29,676
We live under the same roof.

1584
01:55:30,845 --> 01:55:32,722
That's all.

1585
01:55:35,725 --> 01:55:39,161
David,
is there someplace we can go?

1586
01:55:47,205 --> 01:55:49,639
So there it is. Or there it was.

1587
01:55:50,725 --> 01:55:54,274
I could have divorced her for it.
I could have, but I didn't,

1588
01:55:54,445 --> 01:55:57,437
because it would have meant
damaging my career.

1589
01:55:57,965 --> 01:55:59,683
God help me.

1590
01:55:59,845 --> 01:56:02,598
My career seems
to be more important

1591
01:56:02,765 --> 01:56:04,835
than I ever thought it could be.

1592
01:56:05,405 --> 01:56:10,274
I put you out of my mind
and buried myself in my work

1593
01:56:10,445 --> 01:56:12,675
even deeper than before.

1594
01:56:12,845 --> 01:56:15,484
But I guess it never really worked,

1595
01:56:16,885 --> 01:56:19,479
because whenever
I thought of you, it was...

1596
01:56:20,485 --> 01:56:22,123
It was always with love.

1597
01:56:25,085 --> 01:56:28,077
Then the other night,
the moment I saw you,

1598
01:56:28,245 --> 01:56:31,362
it was like seeing you
that very first time.

1599
01:56:32,765 --> 01:56:35,563
But I felt real danger
for both of us.

1600
01:56:37,245 --> 01:56:39,076
You see, that's why...

1601
01:56:39,965 --> 01:56:42,957
I wish I'd had the courage
not to phone you.

1602
01:56:43,285 --> 01:56:46,561
So be careful, Natalie.
I have nothing to offer you

1603
01:56:47,565 --> 01:56:49,317
except pain.
Deep, tender, loving pain...

1604
01:56:49,485 --> 01:56:51,999
And I don't want to hurt you.

1605
01:56:52,205 --> 01:56:55,675
- you understand
what I'm trying to say? - Yes, I do.

1606
01:56:55,845 --> 01:56:58,723
If you had any sense
you'd get up from the table

1607
01:56:58,885 --> 01:57:02,082
and never see me again.
- do you want me to?

1608
01:57:28,525 --> 01:57:30,197
Oh, David.

1609
01:57:31,205 --> 01:57:35,403
I can't bear being
with you any longer, just talking.

1610
01:57:36,605 --> 01:57:39,563
- Is there someplace we Can go?
- No, Natalie.

1611
01:57:39,725 --> 01:57:43,081
- a hotel?
- You wouldn't like that.

1612
01:57:45,885 --> 01:57:48,922
No, neither would you.

1613
01:57:52,765 --> 01:57:55,563
But arrange it, darling, please.

1614
01:58:01,165 --> 01:58:02,883
Busy, busy, busy.

1615
01:58:04,525 --> 01:58:06,755
How's the Nassau Investigation going?

1616
01:58:07,765 --> 01:58:10,359
Don't you want to wait for my report?

1617
01:58:10,525 --> 01:58:12,163
Only if I have to.

1618
01:58:13,045 --> 01:58:15,878
Don't worry. You'll get
the whole story tomorrow.

1619
01:58:16,045 --> 01:58:20,163
I hear you had a talk with their
test pilot, a fellow named Kelly?

1620
01:58:20,325 --> 01:58:21,644
That's right.

1621
01:58:23,325 --> 01:58:25,395
You saved my son's life once.

1622
01:58:25,565 --> 01:58:28,363
You might want to do the same
for his old man.

1623
01:58:28,525 --> 01:58:31,642
You skate on thin ice,
you'll get your feet wet.

1624
01:58:31,805 --> 01:58:34,000
Weren't you skating
on thin ice last night

1625
01:58:34,165 --> 01:58:36,156
making love in public to a young lady

1626
01:58:36,325 --> 01:58:40,398
who bears no resemblance to your
wife? You should be more careful.

1627
01:58:46,165 --> 01:58:48,725
Wait a minute.
Let's be a little realistic.

1628
01:58:48,885 --> 01:58:51,353
We may want to do
each other a big favor.

1629
01:58:51,525 --> 01:58:54,085
Do me a favor.
Get out of the way.

1630
01:58:54,245 --> 01:58:55,963
You know as well as I do

1631
01:58:56,165 --> 01:58:58,042
that Mr Machardie
has some hidebound notions

1632
01:58:58,205 --> 01:59:01,641
about improper behavior around here.
- like the improper way

1633
01:59:01,805 --> 01:59:04,842
you tried to turn the Nassau deal
into your own private game?

1634
01:59:05,005 --> 01:59:09,635
I got proof I plan to put
before the board tomorrow.

1635
01:59:09,805 --> 01:59:13,195
Oh, you wouldn't do that,
because if you do, you go with me.

1636
01:59:13,365 --> 01:59:15,276
You and your plaything.

1637
01:59:15,445 --> 01:59:18,676
- Why don't you go jump in the lake?
- That's your specialty.

1638
01:59:18,845 --> 01:59:21,837
That's how you got
into this company in the first place.

1639
01:59:38,645 --> 01:59:43,673
Sir, could I interest you in a set
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica?

1640
01:59:45,245 --> 01:59:48,715
- Step right this way, young lady and
we will discuss the matter. - Thanks.

1641
01:59:59,005 --> 02:00:03,920
Oh, darling, hold on to me.
Don't let me run away.

1642
02:00:04,925 --> 02:00:09,237
I almost didn't come.
I turned back twice.

1643
02:00:13,365 --> 02:00:15,879
You know, we don't have to stay here.

1644
02:00:16,045 --> 02:00:19,401
We could go for a walk
or out for dinner, go to the...

1645
02:00:33,285 --> 02:00:34,559
Champagne?

1646
02:01:03,285 --> 02:01:04,923
Come here.

1647
02:01:17,765 --> 02:01:20,837
- Look.
- It's lovely.

1648
02:01:22,485 --> 02:01:26,239
You know, I think I'm going
to remember this night for all time.

1649
02:01:26,405 --> 02:01:28,999
And someday, when we finally part,

1650
02:01:29,165 --> 02:01:33,158
I'll go to Spain
and live with my memories.

1651
02:01:33,325 --> 02:01:38,160
As soon as I see you
getting tired of me.

1652
02:01:38,325 --> 02:01:41,283
You'll be too old to travel
when that happens.

1653
02:02:54,205 --> 02:02:55,763
I love you.

1654
02:02:57,965 --> 02:03:01,435
More than I ever thought
I could love anybody.

1655
02:03:01,645 --> 02:03:04,113
I love you, David.

1656
02:03:12,525 --> 02:03:15,119
- Message from Mr Duffy.
- Get out!

1657
02:03:15,285 --> 02:03:18,755
- Get more of the girl.
- I got plenty. - Let's go.

1658
02:03:24,565 --> 02:03:26,283
Come on, let's go!

1659
02:03:32,925 --> 02:03:34,597
Why do I feel this...

1660
02:03:35,725 --> 02:03:38,717
- this kind of death?
- of what?

1661
02:03:41,605 --> 02:03:43,357
I don't know.

1662
02:03:44,685 --> 02:03:48,598
You were just thinking of what
your mother and father would feel,

1663
02:03:48,765 --> 02:03:51,279
if they saw one of those
photographs of us.

1664
02:03:51,445 --> 02:03:54,403
I wasn't thinking that,
and I won't let you.

1665
02:03:57,125 --> 02:03:59,878
Can't keep it out
of your mind forever.

1666
02:04:01,645 --> 02:04:04,443
Unless I play ball
with Duffy tomorrow,

1667
02:04:05,205 --> 02:04:08,003
you're going to be undressed
in public,

1668
02:04:08,165 --> 02:04:09,803
smeared all over the newspapers.

1669
02:04:09,965 --> 02:04:13,401
I don't care. Believe me.
I knew what I was doing.

1670
02:04:13,565 --> 02:04:16,079
I've got to accept the consequences,
whatever they are.

1671
02:04:16,245 --> 02:04:18,361
I won't let them do it to you.

1672
02:04:18,525 --> 02:04:22,279
Not to me. If you're going to let
that man blackmail you,

1673
02:04:22,445 --> 02:04:24,436
it's to protect your career.

1674
02:04:24,605 --> 02:04:26,721
Everything you've worked for,
not me.

1675
02:04:29,485 --> 02:04:32,921
You see? That's the death I feel.

1676
02:04:33,845 --> 02:04:37,679
There will always be that uncertainty
for you, won't there?

1677
02:04:37,845 --> 02:04:39,563
Why you did it, for whom.

1678
02:04:39,725 --> 02:04:43,081
Well, I don't think
I could live with that.

1679
02:04:43,245 --> 02:04:44,963
Can't we end this kind of talk?

1680
02:04:45,125 --> 02:04:47,355
You're very close to saying
final things.

1681
02:04:47,525 --> 02:04:49,641
Maybe they have to be said.

1682
02:04:49,805 --> 02:04:53,718
Maybe there never really
was any future for us

1683
02:04:53,885 --> 02:04:57,844
and it took your friend Mr Duffy
to wake us up from the dream.

1684
02:04:59,685 --> 02:05:01,755
You know what you're doing,
don't you?

1685
02:05:01,965 --> 02:05:05,480
Sending me back to Mary
and yourself back to Mountain City.

1686
02:05:05,645 --> 02:05:07,237
Is that what you want?

1687
02:05:08,925 --> 02:05:11,723
Well, if it is, why don't you say so?

1688
02:05:11,885 --> 02:05:13,557
Because the moment I do...

1689
02:05:14,845 --> 02:05:17,837
I'll feel that my life is over.

1690
02:05:18,005 --> 02:05:21,714
You're trying to force me
to say it, then.

1691
02:05:23,485 --> 02:05:25,396
I guess maybe I am.

1692
02:05:27,205 --> 02:05:29,673
All right, then...

1693
02:05:29,845 --> 02:05:32,678
If that's the way you want it.

1694
02:05:33,965 --> 02:05:36,240
Goodbye, Natalie.

1695
02:05:37,805 --> 02:05:39,875
Goodbye.

1696
02:06:12,405 --> 02:06:14,123
Is something wrong?

1697
02:06:17,805 --> 02:06:21,923
Anything you want to unload?
The least I can do is listen.

1698
02:06:26,205 --> 02:06:27,877
You know something, Alfred?

1699
02:06:29,885 --> 02:06:32,479
You and I could have
such a pleasant relation ship,

1700
02:06:32,645 --> 02:06:36,115
if you'd just unbend a little.
- What kind of relation ship?

1701
02:06:36,285 --> 02:06:39,163
What ever we like.

1702
02:06:40,725 --> 02:06:44,764
Of course, I know there's
no love lost between us, but...

1703
02:06:46,605 --> 02:06:50,154
If you'd just stop playing
the role of the aggrieved husband,

1704
02:06:50,325 --> 02:06:52,395
we might have the same
enjoyable relation ship...

1705
02:06:52,565 --> 02:06:55,523
that a lot of our
married friends have.

1706
02:06:55,685 --> 02:06:59,473
Well, I've seen you look at me
when I knew you wanted me

1707
02:06:59,885 --> 02:07:02,240
and I certainly wanted you.

1708
02:07:02,925 --> 02:07:06,804
And you just turned around
and walked back in your own bedroom.

1709
02:07:07,005 --> 02:07:12,284
I always thought,
He's such a fool, such a waste.

1710
02:07:16,045 --> 02:07:20,084
- Now, wouldn't it be nicer if
we were friends this way? - Shut up.

1711
02:07:24,205 --> 02:07:27,277
You look like an old man
tonight, Alfred.

1712
02:07:27,445 --> 02:07:29,754
What's the matter, is your girl friend
giving you trouble?

1713
02:07:29,925 --> 02:07:31,961
I don't want to talk about it.

1714
02:07:32,165 --> 02:07:34,156
I hope you haven't been
stringing her along

1715
02:07:34,325 --> 02:07:36,793
and telling her
you were going to get a divorce.

1716
02:07:36,965 --> 02:07:40,116
Knowing women, I'm sure
she kept hoping you would

1717
02:07:40,285 --> 02:07:42,435
and now she's angry
because you won't.

1718
02:07:42,605 --> 02:07:44,914
I always knew she had no guts.

1719
02:07:45,085 --> 02:07:46,996
Well, am I wrong?

1720
02:07:47,165 --> 02:07:50,157
Is your girl friend holding out
on you and demanding marriage?

1721
02:07:50,325 --> 02:07:51,678
Mary, please.

1722
02:07:51,845 --> 02:07:54,313
If it'll do you any good
you can tell her

1723
02:07:54,485 --> 02:07:57,841
it's not just your boss man
who's standing in your way.

1724
02:07:58,005 --> 02:08:00,473
You can tell her that
you also have a wife

1725
02:08:00,645 --> 02:08:02,397
who happens to like
her marital arrangement

1726
02:08:02,565 --> 02:08:06,319
and doesn't intend to change it.
Why not?

1727
02:08:06,485 --> 02:08:10,558
It gives me status, security
and a wonderful kind of freedom.

1728
02:08:10,725 --> 02:08:13,193
Well, why are you staring at me?

1729
02:08:21,605 --> 02:08:25,803
When I think of the misery
that we've brought each other,

1730
02:08:26,605 --> 02:08:29,836
the wasted years,
betrayals, humiliations...

1731
02:08:30,685 --> 02:08:32,676
I'm not blaming you for it.

1732
02:08:32,845 --> 02:08:35,120
I guess I did as much as you did

1733
02:08:35,285 --> 02:08:38,436
to destroy whatever
we had between us, but it's gone now.

1734
02:08:38,605 --> 02:08:41,039
It's beyond recovery, dead.

1735
02:08:43,965 --> 02:08:45,796
That's all right.

1736
02:08:47,005 --> 02:08:48,996
We don't need it.

1737
02:08:49,365 --> 02:08:50,764
As a matter of fact,

1738
02:08:50,925 --> 02:08:53,075
maybe it would be more
interesting without it.

1739
02:08:57,245 --> 02:09:00,123
I'm going to bed now, Alfred.

1740
02:09:08,405 --> 02:09:11,317
I'm really not that bad, remember?

1741
02:09:27,885 --> 02:09:29,318
- Mr Eaton?
- Yeah.

1742
02:09:29,485 --> 02:09:30,998
Sign here, please.

1743
02:09:37,005 --> 02:09:38,484
Thank you.

1744
02:09:52,165 --> 02:09:54,998
Before we hear Mr Eaton's report

1745
02:09:55,165 --> 02:09:58,635
on the Nassau Aeronautical
Corporation situation,

1746
02:09:58,805 --> 02:10:03,321
I have a few words to say
of a very happy nature.

1747
02:10:04,605 --> 02:10:06,561
All right, Henry.

1748
02:10:06,725 --> 02:10:11,116
I know you'll forgive me for breaking
one of our more tire some traditions,

1749
02:10:11,285 --> 02:10:15,198
if I decorate this stale
but profitable room today

1750
02:10:15,365 --> 02:10:19,040
with the presence
of an attractive young lady.

1751
02:10:19,765 --> 02:10:23,075
Gentlemen, Mrs Alfred Eaton.

1752
02:10:23,245 --> 02:10:25,315
How do you do?

1753
02:10:25,485 --> 02:10:27,396
Right over there, Mary.

1754
02:10:30,765 --> 02:10:34,519
Mrs Eaton was let into our little
secret, several days ago

1755
02:10:34,685 --> 02:10:38,598
and if I may judge by the look
of surprise on her husband's face

1756
02:10:38,765 --> 02:10:40,244
she's kept her secret

1757
02:10:40,405 --> 02:10:43,522
better than most women
are considered capable of doing.

1758
02:10:45,205 --> 02:10:49,562
Now, Alfred, I come to something
which is no secret

1759
02:10:49,725 --> 02:10:53,081
and that is the high esteem
in which you are held by this firm.

1760
02:10:53,245 --> 02:10:57,284
I speak not only for myself,
but for all my partners.

1761
02:10:57,445 --> 02:11:00,323
You have dedicated yourself
to your work

1762
02:11:00,485 --> 02:11:03,955
with a devotion that might serve
as an example to all young men

1763
02:11:04,165 --> 02:11:06,804
who aspire to success.

1764
02:11:06,965 --> 02:11:10,640
You have sacrificed your own
pleasures and pastimes for us.

1765
02:11:10,805 --> 02:11:13,035
You have traveled all over
the country for us.

1766
02:11:13,205 --> 02:11:16,914
You've sat at your desk until 3:oo
and 4:00 in the morning forus.

1767
02:11:17,085 --> 02:11:20,316
And time and again you have executed
difficult assignments

1768
02:11:20,525 --> 02:11:24,313
with more boldness and courage
than we had any right to expect.

1769
02:11:24,485 --> 02:11:27,795
Not only that.
And this is especially important.

1770
02:11:27,965 --> 02:11:30,433
You have made us proud
of your performance

1771
02:11:30,605 --> 02:11:33,244
in the private walks
of your life as well.

1772
02:11:33,405 --> 02:11:37,114
I think you know what I mean now.
There you have conducted yourself

1773
02:11:37,285 --> 02:11:40,721
with a wisdom, maturity, good taste

1774
02:11:40,885 --> 02:11:44,958
and a fine sense of responsibility
to your business position.

1775
02:11:45,125 --> 02:11:48,037
And soon, I think
you'll see why it was worth it.

1776
02:11:48,205 --> 02:11:50,594
It's now time to be specific.

1777
02:11:50,805 --> 02:11:54,241
As long we were all going
to be assembled here today

1778
02:11:54,405 --> 02:11:57,078
I thought this would be
the proper occasion

1779
02:11:57,245 --> 02:12:00,635
to tell you before you read about
it in the Wall Street Journal

1780
02:12:00,805 --> 02:12:03,399
that you have just become
the first man,

1781
02:12:03,565 --> 02:12:05,521
on the sunny side of 40,

1782
02:12:05,685 --> 02:12:09,837
ever to be made a full partner
of Machardie and Company.

1783
02:12:10,045 --> 02:12:11,956
Congratulations, Alfred.

1784
02:12:12,925 --> 02:12:15,519
Congratulations.

1785
02:12:15,685 --> 02:12:17,562
Congratulations, Mrs Eaton.

1786
02:12:17,725 --> 02:12:19,955
Congratulations.

1787
02:12:27,365 --> 02:12:28,684
Now, then...

1788
02:12:36,285 --> 02:12:38,116
Mr Machardie...

1789
02:12:38,645 --> 02:12:40,397
Gentlemen, I...

1790
02:12:41,645 --> 02:12:43,397
I am deeply honored.

1791
02:12:44,485 --> 02:12:49,275
I'm flattered by your generous
bestowal of a partnership

1792
02:12:50,845 --> 02:12:55,123
'cause this is a day
that I have been working toward

1793
02:12:55,285 --> 02:12:58,038
with every fiber of my being.

1794
02:12:58,805 --> 02:13:02,957
For like all well-brought-up
American males

1795
02:13:03,125 --> 02:13:05,355
I have always been aware of the fact

1796
02:13:05,525 --> 02:13:07,959
that nothing
is more important in life

1797
02:13:08,125 --> 02:13:12,915
than the attaining of wealth
and high position.

1798
02:13:14,645 --> 02:13:18,274
And I can honestly say that I never
allowed anything to sway me

1799
02:13:18,445 --> 02:13:19,924
from my goal of achieving it.

1800
02:13:20,085 --> 02:13:21,438
When business called,

1801
02:13:21,605 --> 02:13:24,563
I never let personal responsibilities
stand in the way.

1802
02:13:24,725 --> 02:13:26,681
If anything ever threatened
to interfere

1803
02:13:26,845 --> 02:13:29,200
with the affairs
of Machardie and Company,

1804
02:13:29,405 --> 02:13:33,683
I always knew
that there would only be one choice

1805
02:13:33,845 --> 02:13:38,555
and I invariably made it. Because
I have truly learned, gentlemen,

1806
02:13:38,765 --> 02:13:41,723
as Mr Machardie
so gracefully put it,

1807
02:13:42,725 --> 02:13:48,038
that it does take wisdom,
maturity, good taste

1808
02:13:48,645 --> 02:13:53,241
and a fine sense of responsibility
to one's business position

1809
02:13:53,405 --> 02:13:57,000
if one is to get ahead
in this world.

1810
02:13:57,165 --> 02:14:00,635
Some men think
in very small terms, gentlemen.

1811
02:14:00,805 --> 02:14:03,478
If they find themselves
married to a woman,

1812
02:14:03,645 --> 02:14:06,842
who has been unfaithful to them,

1813
02:14:07,005 --> 02:14:11,635
they dissolve the marriage just as
if they owed no responsibility

1814
02:14:11,805 --> 02:14:14,239
to the business firm
for which they worked.

1815
02:14:14,405 --> 02:14:17,761
And if they find genuine happiness
with another woman

1816
02:14:17,925 --> 02:14:22,316
they embrace it
as if they had no consideration

1817
02:14:23,525 --> 02:14:25,641
of their business colleagues.

1818
02:14:25,805 --> 02:14:28,763
These men do not become
successful, gentlemen.

1819
02:14:28,925 --> 02:14:32,713
They do not become full partners
at Machardie and Company.

1820
02:14:32,885 --> 02:14:36,639
They become abject failures.

1821
02:14:37,605 --> 02:14:42,156
They take their place alongside
the millions of mediocrities

1822
02:14:42,325 --> 02:14:47,240
who value a houseful of kids,
a host of friends,

1823
02:14:47,405 --> 02:14:49,635
photograph albums filled
with trivial memories

1824
02:14:49,805 --> 02:14:54,959
above all the truly important
considerations of this world.

1825
02:14:55,725 --> 02:14:58,603
With all due modesty, gentlemen,

1826
02:14:59,685 --> 02:15:02,916
I feel that I have earned
the position you have given me today.

1827
02:15:03,085 --> 02:15:05,724
No one here deserves it
more truly than I.

1828
02:15:05,885 --> 02:15:07,876
- One second...
- I'm not through yet.

1829
02:15:08,085 --> 02:15:11,157
My first act as a partner
will be to deliver my report

1830
02:15:11,325 --> 02:15:14,795
on the Nassau Aeronautical situation.
And after you've read it,

1831
02:15:14,965 --> 02:15:18,116
I'm quite sure that
my friend Mr Duffy there

1832
02:15:18,285 --> 02:15:21,163
will want to issue another
report on another subject

1833
02:15:21,325 --> 02:15:23,759
namely, the newest partner
of MachHardie and Company,

1834
02:15:23,965 --> 02:15:26,081
the newest and possibly
the shortest-lived.

1835
02:15:26,245 --> 02:15:28,122
And, now, if you will excuse me

1836
02:15:28,285 --> 02:15:31,675
I have other, less important
business to attend to.

1837
02:15:31,885 --> 02:15:34,240
- Sorry.
- What...

1838
02:15:34,405 --> 02:15:37,954
- What Is the meaning of this?
- What's the matter with him?

1839
02:15:44,085 --> 02:15:45,313
Alfred.

1840
02:15:45,485 --> 02:15:47,715
I know you've come
to congratulate me. Thank you.

1841
02:15:47,885 --> 02:15:50,638
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- That was terribly

1842
02:15:50,805 --> 02:15:52,921
considerate of you last night
when you were telling me

1843
02:15:53,085 --> 02:15:55,076
"about the" "beautiful relation ship"
"we could have"

1844
02:15:55,245 --> 02:15:57,122
but you never mentioned
the partner ship.

1845
02:15:57,285 --> 02:15:58,923
Because maybe I would've thought

1846
02:15:59,085 --> 02:16:01,553
the partner ship had something
to do with your new-found

1847
02:16:01,725 --> 02:16:04,034
if somewhat unwholesome
interest in our marriage.

1848
02:16:04,205 --> 02:16:07,197
Alfred.
Alfred, I want to talk to you.

1849
02:16:07,365 --> 02:16:09,321
Any further communication
between you and me

1850
02:16:09,485 --> 02:16:12,318
will be through legal channels.
- Alfred.

1851
02:16:13,205 --> 02:16:16,038
Go to her.
It won't do you any good.

1852
02:16:16,205 --> 02:16:17,524
If she's foolish enough,

1853
02:16:17,685 --> 02:16:20,404
nothing will stop me
from spending my life with her.

1854
02:16:20,565 --> 02:16:22,157
I'll never give you a divorce.

1855
02:16:22,325 --> 02:16:25,635
Wait till you see the photographs

1856
02:16:25,805 --> 02:16:28,797
Mr Duffy will release for public
consumption. - What photographs?

1857
02:16:28,965 --> 02:16:31,240
You won't be able
to show your face in this city

1858
02:16:31,405 --> 02:16:34,636
if you don't give me a divorce.
How do you like them apples?
