1
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,312
Good morning, schoolmaster.

2
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,866
See the kite?

3
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,726
Tell us a story!

4
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:26,829
<i>Wait for me, Hans! Please wait.
Well, hurry up. Faster!</i>

5
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,709
Thank you.

6
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,959
Next time, don't be late.

7
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:38,925
Now, yesterday, Matilda was the wicked
mermaid - the princess of the frozen sea.

8
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,927
<i>- Remember that?
- Yes.</i>

9
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,798
Today, as I promised -
we always keep our promises, don't we?

10
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,511
<i>Yes!</i>

11
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,771
<i>- Today, as I promised, she will be the...
- Queen of China!</i>

12
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:55,109
Did anybody remember to bring
a dress for the queen of China?

13
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,726
<i>You said you would!</i>

14
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,986
All right.

15
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,986
Please, ladies and gentlemen.

16
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:06,072
If we can't have a queen,
then we'll have a king.

17
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:10,368
It's very simple. We just take
the crown and put it over on the side.

18
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:15,376
He was a very jaunty little king -
wore his crown like that. Now, we'll just...

19
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,415
Ah... No peeping.

20
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,800
There we are.

21
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,302
Long live the king!

22
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,259
<i>Long live the king!</i>

23
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:31,639
That's not a king.
It's only a queen with a moustache.

24
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,057
Well, a lot of kings
are only a queen with a moustache.

25
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,813
- We all believe it's a king, don't we?
- Yes!

26
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,523
Since we have no clothes for the king,

27
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,993
this is a story about a king
who had no clothes,

28
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:52,333
and about a little boy
who only believed what he saw.

29
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,709
<i>That's you!</i>

30
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:01,007
Well, one day, two swindlers
came to see the king

31
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,503
to sell him what they said
was a magic suit of clothes.

32
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,968
Now, the king was very fond of new
clothes, so he said, "Let me see it."

33
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:14,179
But there wasn't any suit of clothes.
The swindlers held up their hands like this

34
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,731
and said,
"Your Majesty, this is a magic suit.

35
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:22,356
"You, being very wise and intelligent,
can see how beautiful it is,

36
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,776
"but to a fool, it is absolutely invisible."

37
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,449
Well, he said, "I see."

38
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,236
Not wanting to appear a fool, he added,

39
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,708
"Yes, indeed. I see it perfectly.

40
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,579
"It's beautiful.

41
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:42,008
"Isn't it grand? Isn't it fine?
Look at the cut, the style, the line!

42
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,669
"The suit of clothes is altogether
but altogether, it's altogether

43
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,007
"The most remarkable suit of clothes
that I have ever seen

44
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,925
"These eyes of mine at once determine
the sleeves are velvet, the cape is ermine

45
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,181
"The hose are blue and
the doublet is a lovely shade of green!"

46
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,604
<i>A lovely shade of green!</i>

47
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,857
"Somebody send for the queen!"

48
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:07,024
The queen came and she was told
how all the wise people could see the...

49
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,160
<i>- Magic suit!
- That's right.</i>

50
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,119
Naturally, not wanting
to appear a fool, she said,

51
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,168
"Oh! Isn't it grand?

52
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,462
"Isn't it rich?
Look at the charm of every stitch!

53
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,210
"The suit of clothes is altogether,
it's altogether

54
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,794
"The most remarkable suit of clothes
that I have ever seen

55
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,926
"These eyes of mine at once determine
the sleeves are velvet, the cape is ermine

56
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,344
"The hose are blue and the doublet
is a lovely shade of green!"

57
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,606
- A lovely shade of green!
- "Summon the court to convene!"

58
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,184
All the court came, the ministers
and ambassadors came.

59
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,021
Not wanting to seem like fools,
they agreed with the...

60
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,614
- King and queen.
- The king issued a proclamation.

61
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,372
The suit of clothes is altogether
but altogether, it's altogether

62
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,371
The most remarkable suit of clothes
a tailor ever made

63
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:05,130
Now quickly put it altogether
with gloves of leather and hat and feather

64
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,509
It's altogether the thing
to wear at Saturday's parade

65
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,848
- Saturday's parade!
- Leading the royal brigade!

66
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,925
By this time, everybody had heard
about the king's new clothes

67
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,055
that he would wear at the parade.

68
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:24,480
The people lined the streets as
the artillery came by, the infantry came by,

69
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:29,024
and the cavalry came by and the fife
and drum corps and the royal guard,

70
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,280
and finally the king.

71
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,818
Everybody cheered "Hurray"...

72
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,571
...because nobody wanted
to appear a fool.

73
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,746
Nobody that is except one little boy

74
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:46,505
who, for some strange reason, hadn't
heard about the king's new magic suit,

75
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,967
and didn't know
what he was supposed to see.

76
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,670
He took one look at the king,

77
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,093
turned a little pale and said,

78
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,058
"Look at the king! Look at the king!

79
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,937
"The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

80
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,484
"He's altogether as naked
as the day that he was born

81
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,899
"The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

82
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,319
"It's altogether the very least
the king has ever worn

83
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,656
"Call the court physician,
call an intermission

84
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:21,372
"His majesty is wide open
to ridicule and scorn

85
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:25,665
"The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

86
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,419
"He's altogether as naked
as the day that he was born

87
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:33,841
"And it's altogether too chilly a morn!"

88
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,309
<i>- Hans!
- Hurry, Peter.</i>

89
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,643
We're going to hear another story.

90
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,521
Hans, the schoolmaster
went to the Burgomaster and the...

91
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,436
Peter, don't worry so much
on a beautiful day like this.

92
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:56,445
They're coming here - the schoolmaster,
the Burgomaster, the council. Look!

93
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,085
<i>Good morning, Burgomaster.</i>

94
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:11,046
Look, Burgomaster.
The books - on the dirty ground!

95
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,631
<i>Here. The History of Denmark
used to tie the string of a dirty kite!</i>

96
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:20,549
The history of any country
can always stand a little fresh air.

97
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,103
Did you hear about the history book
that took a vacation

98
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,315
and came back a much better history?

99
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,519
You see? That's the stuff
he fills the children's heads with!

100
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,065
Look at this.

101
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:38,071
"Arithmetic. A two met a four one day.

102
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,572
"They liked each other immediately
and got married,

103
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,910
"and all the other numbers
came to their wedding."

104
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:49,421
- It's impossible!
- There are different ways of learning.

105
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,415
A cobbler belongs in his shop,
and children belong in school.

106
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,715
- Tend to your shoes. I'll tend to my school!
- To be sure.

107
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:03,804
But is the world made up of nothing else
but shoes and schoolrooms, and...?

108
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:09,521
There's a story
of a piece of chalk and a blackboard.

109
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:13,602
The piece of chalk had written
so many things on the blackboard

110
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,657
that it believed
it knew all about everything.

111
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,610
The blackboard was angry.

112
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:23,074
She felt that without her to write upon,
nobody would know anything,

113
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,781
and she was the one
who really knew it all.

114
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,041
One day, quite by accident,

115
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,666
the schoolmaster broke the piece of chalk
and tossed it out of the window.

116
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:37,011
It fell beside a pencil that the piece
of chalk had always admired.

117
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:41,218
A pencil to a piece of chalk
is something very special.

118
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:45,561
- And what do you suppose happened?
- What happened?

119
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:48,688
<i>What is this? Have we all lost our senses?</i>

120
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,482
Are you going listen to him
with the children? What is this?

121
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,734
That will be enough, Hans.

122
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:59,573
Children, pick up your schoolbooks
and go back to school. Hurry now.

123
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:03,735
Follow the schoolmaster.
Not another word from anyone.

124
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:16,797
I advise you, Hans, to stay in your shop
from now on. Come, gentlemen.

125
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,929
Stop shaking your head at me
like an old woman, Peter.

126
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:33,568
- I can feel it in the back of my neck.
- Hans, turn around. I've got to talk to you.

127
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,351
Did you ever hear
the story of the old woman

128
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:41,317
who shook her head at the family
so much that it fell off, right on the table?

129
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,370
Hans, why do you keep
on making trouble for us?

130
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,657
Trouble? There's no trouble
that a good story can't get us out of -

131
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:54,088
like the one just now about the piece
of chalk and the blackboard.

132
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,963
I didn't know what I was going to say
until after I'd said it.

133
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:01,296
In fact, I'd like to know
how the story ends myself.

134
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:05,641
Please stay in the shop. Don't tell
the children stories all the time.

135
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,389
I never saw such a worrier like you, Peter.

136
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:12,601
You want to really worry
about something? Here's something.

137
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,568
Two years ago, I took you
out of the orphanage

138
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:20,107
and promised them I'd make you
into a good cobbler. Two whole years.

139
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:24,736
Look at that shoe - glue all smeared
and nails in crooked.

140
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,827
Two years an apprentice,
and still the nails go in crooked.

141
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm not that bad, am I? You're not going to
send me back to the orphanage, are you?

142
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,625
Aha! A new worry appears in the sky.

143
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,588
Never mind, Peter. Let's go home.

144
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:06,323
<i>Two and two are four</i>

145
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:10,285
Four and four are eight

146
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:14,627
Eight and eight are sixteen

147
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:19,463
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two

148
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,624
Two and two are four

149
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:27,677
Four and four are eight

150
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,889
Eight and eight are sixteen

151
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:36,054
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two...

152
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:39,478
An inchworm. The first one of the year!

153
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:44,937
<i>Four and four are eight</i>

154
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,405
Eight and eight are sixteen

155
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:54,698
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two...

156
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,456
Inchworm

157
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,996
Inchworm

158
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:05,376
Measuring the marigolds

159
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:10,222
You and your arithmetic

160
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:15,392
You'll probably go far

161
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,230
Inchworm

162
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,193
Inchworm

163
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:26,610
Measuring the marigolds

164
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,901
Seems to me

165
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,037
You stop and see

166
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:38,083
How beautiful they are

167
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:42,624
<i>Two and two are four</i>

168
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:47,799
Four and four are eight

169
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:52,640
Eight and eight are sixteen

170
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:57,679
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two

171
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,492
Good morning, schoolmaster.

172
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,951
Oh, Hans.

173
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,133
- Let me explain...
- Out of my way!

174
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,940
<i>I am talking sense,
and that is exactly what I want.</i>

175
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,656
Either Hans Christian Andersen
leaves this town or I do.

176
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:56,661
Surely, schoolmaster, a little story
now and then - not during school hours.

177
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,744
It is not just now and then, it is all the time.

178
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,451
When they are late,
he gives them excuses.

179
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,503
"The snow queen took me
to see the king of the mountain!"

180
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,335
That is true.
I asked my Gerda what time it was.

181
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:15,132
She said the minute hand and the hour
hand were not speaking to each other.

182
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,304
They were both in love
with the second hand.

183
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,894
They wouldn't meet till 12 o'clock,
and no one could tell the time until then.

184
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,899
- I like that.
- Like it?

185
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:32,189
We pay our taxes for the school, not for
Hans to fill their heads with foolishness.

186
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:36,074
But Hans's stories are good.
The children learn from them.

187
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,787
- They are not foolish stories.
- I would like to know now.

188
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,827
I would like to pack up tonight.

189
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,828
Tomorrow, you'll be looking
for a new cobbler or a new teacher.

190
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,514
Gentlemen...

191
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,932
It is decided. The cobbler must leave.

192
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,189
- But...
- Quiet!

193
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:11,028
I'll tell Hans myself. It will not be pleasant,
but I see it has to be done.

194
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,154
Perhaps it's all for the best.
Tell Hans to wait in the shop for me.

195
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,572
I'll talk to him before supper.
Come, gentlemen.

196
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,325
- Hello, Hans.
- Hello, Peter.

197
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:53,997
- Was it nice by the river?
- Just perfect.

198
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:56,671
Did we have any customers today?

199
00:17:56,885 --> 00:18:01,346
Not one. It just gets slower and slower.

200
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,551
Don't you think we should go to a larger
city where shoes wear out faster?

201
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:11,811
And be stuck in the shop all day?
No, sir. I like business to be a little slow.

202
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,598
There's time enough for everything here.

203
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:18,769
That's what I mean, Hans. No shoes
wear out. No one ever leaves.

204
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,320
Not one person in this village
has ever been to Copenhagen, have they?

205
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:28,080
That's true, but why should they?
I never think about Copenhagen - do you?

206
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,992
Do I? What do you suppose
Copenhagen is really like?

207
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:40,128
It's a funny thing, now that you mention it.
I used to think about Copenhagen a lot.

208
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:44,129
I used to make up the most wonderful
stories about going there.

209
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:48,014
I used to think about Copenhagen
a lot when I was your age.

210
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,220
My husband says the shoes hurt.

211
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:55,681
- They squeak and the left one doesn't fit.
- That's all? That's not too bad, Mrs Burda.

212
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,651
I sometimes think
that shoes have a life of their own.

213
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:02,782
The ones that squeak
don't like to leave the shop,

214
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:06,492
and the ones that hurt
don't like whoever's wearing them.

215
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:11,082
Please, Hans, just fix the shoes.
I've got my own life to worry about.

216
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:14,958
When Mr Burda's feet hurt,
he drives the whole house crazy.

217
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:19,418
Hans, tell me. What kind of stories
did you make up about Copenhagen?

218
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:27,216
Oh... I used to dream about having
the finest cobbler shop in Copenhagen.

219
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:32,559
I wasn't just an ordinary cobbler.
I only saw people by appointment.

220
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,355
First I looked at them
before I even looked at their shoes,

221
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:38,691
and if I didn't like them, no shoes.

222
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:40,896
Do you know that peop...?

223
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:44,815
Where are you going?
Don't you want to hear the rest of it?

224
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:50,662
- What's that?
- Your bag. It's all packed, Hans.

225
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:54,290
- My bag?
- Go to Copenhagen now. Right now.

226
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:56,542
Are you crazy, Peter?

227
00:19:56,755 --> 00:20:00,420
That was a story I was telling.
Didn't you understand that?

228
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:04,583
Of course I understood,
but part of it must be like you imagined,

229
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,841
and maybe even great carriages
with fine horses,

230
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:10,430
beautiful houses three storeys high.

231
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:15,602
Don't you want to see it for yourself? It's
not so far from here - your bag's packed.

232
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:20,359
All you have to do is walk out of that door.
Quick! Before you change your mind.

233
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:26,952
Before I change my mind? Who said
I was going? Just like that, this afternoon?

234
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,402
What's got into you, Peter, anyway?

235
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:32,456
You forgot about Copenhagen
all these years.

236
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,082
You may forget about it again
until you're too old to go.

237
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:38,964
No, some day I'm really going
to Copenhagen.

238
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,375
- That's the one thing I'm sure of.
- Who knows?

239
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:47,005
Has anyone from this village gone
to Copenhagen before? Of course not.

240
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:51,006
They keep putting it off.
Imagine, Hans, you'll be the first.

241
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:55,769
What a to-do there'll be tomorrow.
They'll talk of nothing else for days.

242
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:58,139
"Hans has gone to Copenhagen!"

243
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:03,983
"Hans has gone to Copenhagen."

244
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:09,615
Yes!

245
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:14,786
What a sign it would make! "Hans
Christian Andersen, gone to Copenhagen"

246
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,333
with little shoes pointing
the way out of town!

247
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:24,548
I'll make the sign tonight. I see it exactly
as you do - the little shoes, everything!

248
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,215
Goodbye, Hans. Aren't you excited?

249
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:30,513
<i>Excited? You mean
I really should go, Peter?</i>

250
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:33,215
Why not? It's only a few days away.

251
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:37,931
You stay a little while and then come
back, but you've been to Copenhagen.

252
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:39,975
But it's a big step, Peter.

253
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:43,442
Still, what's to stop me?

254
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:46,688
My goodness, I am getting excited!

255
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:48,449
Hans!

256
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:52,952
If anyone had told me this morning
that I'd decide to go to Copenhagen...

257
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:55,369
- Start walking!
- Imagine, Peter.

258
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:59,580
I've decided to go to Copenhagen,
just like I made it up in a story.

259
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:02,879
- Goodbye, Hans.
- Goodbye, Peter.

260
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:07,668
Goodbye, Peter, and take care of yourself.
I'll only be gone a few days.

261
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:10,555
- Tell the children goodbye for me.
- I will.

262
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,884
Imagine, Peter - Copenhagen!

263
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,010
Goodbye, Peter.

264
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:46,631
Hello.

265
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:54,596
Oh, my goodness. My feet hurt.

266
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,519
I cannot understand
why these shoes hurt me so.

267
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:07,560
I made them myself. You're lucky.
You don't have to wear shoes.

268
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:13,022
I can never understand why people
use that expression "A dog's life".

269
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:18,368
Every dog I ever knew
seemed to have a very nice life indeed.

270
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:22,665
You've no idea, and maybe
it's just as good you don't.

271
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:27,547
Back in the village, if people
saw me talking to you like this,

272
00:23:27,757 --> 00:23:30,675
do you know what would happen?

273
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:35,049
Every head would shake for a week,
and yet how pleasant this is!

274
00:23:36,308 --> 00:23:41,016
I can say anything I want to, and there's
no sound except the wag of your tail.

275
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,644
And people do the strangest things, too.

276
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,145
Oh, yes, my friend.
Even me. Myself included.

277
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,605
For instance, if you were to ask me

278
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:56,822
what I was doing on the road
to Copenhagen, do you know something?

279
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:58,697
I couldn't tell you.

280
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:03,576
I was trying to figure it out a little
while ago - what Peter said, what I said.

281
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:07,209
All of a sudden, I find myself
on the road to Copenhagen.

282
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:10,921
Do you know something else, my friend?

283
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:13,590
I'm a little bit frightened.

284
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:16,923
Copenhagen is a very big place.

285
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,841
Still, what can happen, huh?

286
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:23,267
People are nice.

287
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,391
That's the nice thing about the world,
my friend - people.

288
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,813
So, what can happen?

289
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:36,696
I'll walk through the gates of the city,
go up to someone and say,

290
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,908
"How do you do?
I'm Hans Christian Andersen."

291
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:48,536
I'll walk through the gates of the city, and
I'll say, "I'm Hans Christian Andersen".

292
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:51,328
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

293
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,838
I've many a tale to tell

294
00:24:54,052 --> 00:24:58,002
And though I'm a cobbler,
I'd say I tell them rather well

295
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:02,268
I'll mend your shoes and I'll fix
your boots when I have a moment free

296
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:04,269
When I'm not otherwise occupied

297
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:08,144
As a purple duck or a mountain side
or a quarter after three

298
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:12,107
I'm Hans Christian Andersen,
that's me!

299
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:20,536
I'm Hans Christian Andersen
and this is an April day

300
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:24,494
It's full of the magic I need
to speed me on my way

301
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:28,492
My pocketbook has an empty look
I limp on a lumpy shoe

302
00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:30,539
So I turn into a flying fish

303
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:34,504
Or a millionaire with a rocking chair
and a dumpling in my stew

304
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:36,627
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

305
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:38,505
Andersen, that's who!

306
00:25:39,347 --> 00:25:41,387
<i>Hans!</i>

307
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,639
Hans!

308
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:50,724
Peter!

309
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:58,403
Peter, what are you doing here?

310
00:25:58,617 --> 00:26:01,653
What's this? You've got
the whole shop on wheels.

311
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,539
Copenhagen sounded so wonderful, Hans,

312
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:08,330
I got to thinking maybe
you wouldn't come back for a while.

313
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:12,671
Maybe for a long while,
so I thought maybe you'd need the shop.

314
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:17,507
Peter, sometimes I think you put ideas
into my head that aren't even there.

315
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:20,673
Me? Oh, no, Hans.

316
00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:24,472
I'm not at all sure I shouldn't
send you back right now.

317
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:27,602
- But, Hans...
- Still...

318
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:30,600
...as long as you've come this far...

319
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:46,365
I sail up the Skagerrak

320
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:49,119
And sail down the Kattegatt

321
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:54,079
Through the harbour and up to the quay

322
00:26:54,297 --> 00:26:57,583
And there she stands

323
00:26:57,801 --> 00:27:00,422
Waiting for me

324
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:06,509
With a welcome so warm and so gay

325
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:13,308
Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen

326
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:17,854
Friendly old girl of a town

327
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,858
'Neath her tavern light

328
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,565
On this merry night

329
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:29,372
<i>Let us clink and drink one down</i>

Hans, why don't we set up shop here?

00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:11,669
Here? Well, what are we waiting for?

375
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:28,279
I'm Hans Christian Andersen,
the pride of the cobbler's trade

376
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:32,782
Permit me to show you
a great discovery I've made

377
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:37,121
A shoe goes squeak and a shoe goes
squawk, a squeak-iddy-squawk all day

378
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,865
Though you'd figure a shoe can't talk, if
you listen close to the squeak and squawk

379
00:31:41,084 --> 00:31:42,709
You can plainly hear it say

380
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:46,371
"Let Hans Christian Andersen
fix me right away!"

381
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:53,220
In Hans Christian Andersen
your feet have a loyal friend

382
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:57,558
The sort of a doctor, I'm sure,
your toes would recommend

383
00:31:57,767 --> 00:32:01,053
I work all night if a shoe's too tight
to see where the pinch comes from

384
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:05,600
I raise my hammer and shut one eye
and I sometimes hit on the reason why

385
00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:08,818
And I sometimes hit my thumb. Oh!

386
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:12,195
- What's your name?
- I'm Hans Christian Andersen!

387
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:15,159
- You're under arrest.
- Under arrest?

388
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:18,322
Disrespect for the King's statue.
Get that boy!

389
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:29,162
Run, Peter! Run!

390
00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:11,589
Do you want the new ballet ready
for the tour, Otto? Then do as I say - now!

391
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,628
- You heard what we said.
- Niels, be sensible.

392
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:19,847
All right, don't do it. Stand here and argue.

393
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:23,557
I'll get a cobbler
while you go and teach them the ballet.

394
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,519
Why is it a matter of life and death
to have a cobbler right now?

395
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:30,817
Because you have a ballerina
who is so pig-headed

396
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:34,942
that I must make an example of her
in front of the entire company.

397
00:33:35,156 --> 00:33:36,734
That's awful perfume.

398
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,192
- Sir, I know where...
- Go away!

399
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:43,574
She won't get away with this.
I know her far better than you do.

400
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,417
- Very well. You know her...
- Otto, the ballet is only half finished.

401
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:52,496
No cobbler, no ballet. I guarantee it, Otto!

402
00:33:54,885 --> 00:33:58,300
- I know where you can get a cobbler, sir.
- What's that?

403
00:33:58,513 --> 00:34:01,265
I said I know
where you can get a cobbler, sir.

404
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:02,803
Where?

405
00:34:03,018 --> 00:34:06,303
- You'll have to use a little influence.
- Influence?

406
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:09,012
With the police. We should hurry, sir.

407
00:34:09,232 --> 00:34:12,518
I know where one is sitting right now!

408
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:35,253
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

409
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,523
- Hello!
- Hello!

410
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,741
Are you all alone in there?

411
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:44,288
Well, in a way, yes.

412
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,208
- Are you scared?
- Hmm?

413
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:50,203
- Are you scared?
- Scared? No.

414
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:53,922
Nobody's ever really alone.
Did you know that?

415
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:57,420
As a matter of fact,
I'm expecting company right now.

416
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,758
Would you like me to introduce you?
Are you sure?

417
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,469
Absolutely sure?

418
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:05,354
Don't go away.

419
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:27,166
- There.
- Oh!

420
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:32,371
Isn't she pretty? Her name is Thumbelina.
Say hello, Thumbelina.

421
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,417
Now you say hello to her.

422
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,962
Hello.

423
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,844
She's very unhappy.

424
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:43,096
What's the matter, Thumbelina?

425
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:46,925
Are you unhappy because you're so little?

426
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:50,266
That's nothing to make
such a sad face about, is it?

427
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,522
Here. Come on.

428
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:56,270
Though you're no bigger than my thumb

429
00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:00,189
Than my thumb, than my thumb

430
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:03,280
Sweet Thumbelina, don't be glum

431
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,656
Now, now, now, ah, ah, ah,
come, come, come

432
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,873
Thumbelina, Thumbelina
tiny little thing

433
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:15,172
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing

434
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:19,167
Oh, Thumbelina, what's the difference
if you're very small?

435
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:23,965
When your heart is full of love,
you're nine feet tall!

436
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:29,178
Oh, she's still unhappy. What's the matter,
Thumbie? Would you like a playmate?

437
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:31,057
You would? Here.

438
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:34,943
There. Say how do you do.

439
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,563
Want a kiss?

440
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:41,488
Would you like to dance?
You would? Well, here we go.

441
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:45,615
Thumbelina, Thumbelina, tiny little thing

442
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,530
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing

443
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,333
Thumbelina, what's the difference
if you're very small?

444
00:36:53,546 --> 00:37:00,213
When your heart is full of love,
you're nine feet tall!

445
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,173
<i>Open up.</i>

446
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,886
- Hans!
- Peter!

447
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,184
- What are you doing here?
- You're a cobbler?

448
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,810
- Yes.
- Hurry.

449
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:19,652
You are in the custody
of the Royal Danish Ballet. Come along!

450
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:25,028
- What am I in the custody of?
- Shh! You're out - that's the main thing.

451
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,735
- They didn't treat you badly, Hans?
- No.

452
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:30,031
- Where's your coat?
- Here.

453
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:34,911
<i>- Where are we going? Who is that man?
- What are you doing? Come along!</i>

454
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:37,798
Come on, Hans. We've got our first job!

455
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,133
<i>Straight! Straight!</i>

456
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:45,089
Straight!

457
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:47,512
Keep the line straight!

458
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:49,136
Up! Up!

459
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,060
Good.

460
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:40,398
- This is the most...
- Shh! Dress rehearsal.

461
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:38,450
All right.

462
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:40,704
We'll do it all over again.

463
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:46,869
Ladies, the pirouettes were impossible.
Gentlemen, the lifts have to be higher.

464
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:50,375
The ballerina's performance
I won't begin to discuss.

465
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:54,044
That would take till tomorrow morning.
We'll do it again.

466
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:56,303
Not with these shoes, darling.

467
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:59,351
I told you before, remember?

468
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:03,891
Stop! Everything stop.

469
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,482
Is the cobbler here yet?

470
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:10,567
- Here I am.
- Come up here, cobbler.

471
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:14,570
Come on. Hurry up!

472
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:25,658
Cobbler, this lady will explain to you
what she wants you to do.

473
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:31,465
It's a trifle complicated, but she's no
ordinary dancer. She's something special.

474
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:36,385
Of all the dancers in Denmark, she is
the only one who cannot follow my steps

475
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:39,847
without special shoes
that exist only in her mind.

476
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:42,811
All this she will make clear
to you, perhaps.

477
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,855
We cannot understand
so great a ballerina

478
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:49,399
We must only bow to her every wish.

479
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,769
Not quite low enough, my dear!

480
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:56,484
Come, sir. We can talk more quietly
over there, I think.

481
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:02,743
<i>Lunch, everybody.</i>

482
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:08,658
You've seen the ballet
when I make a jeté?

483
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,584
You know - when I jump.

484
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:14,551
I want to rise and then remain motionless,

485
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,054
as though I were standing
on nothing but air.

486
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:22,266
It is impossible with these shoes,

487
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:27,933
but if you could put something in the tip
of each one, I could do it, I'm sure I could,

488
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:31,066
in spite of that unkind man.

489
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:34,693
I would so love to show him
it is not impossible.

490
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:36,945
It is possible, isn't it?

491
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:38,652
Could you do it?

492
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:40,907
Yes.

493
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,576
Yes, I can do it.

494
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,829
I'll find something.

495
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:47,999
Something soft and silent.

496
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:49,871
I'm sure I can do it.

497
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:54,085
- You could really seem to stand on air.
- You have it!

498
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,052
I can see you have the idea perfectly.

499
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:59,931
I shall be so grateful to you.

500
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:03,508
There, can you do it now - quickly?

501
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:09,313
It would be such a service.
I would be forever grateful. Thank you.

502
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:11,563
Louise, my slippers!

503
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:17,152
<i>You have to go out this way.</i>

504
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:21,656
Hans!

505
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:25,487
Goodness, you were a long time!
Have we got a job?

506
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:28,947
- What are you holding?
- Slippers.

507
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:34,079
Slippers? I never saw slippers like that
before. Who wears a thing like that?

508
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:37,999
- The loveliest lady I've ever seen.
- Why does she wear these?

509
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:41,504
She dances - no, she floats.

510
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:45,257
When she smiles, your heart skips
a beat and then melts.

511
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:48,762
She smiled and stood close to me.
She even touched me.

512
00:44:49,856 --> 00:44:51,184
Where's the barrow?

513
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:54,898
- I promised these to her quickly.
- Right over here.

514
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:58,570
I hid it here in the theatre storeroom.

515
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:03,028
She wants shoes that will walk on air,
Peter. This afternoon.

516
00:45:03,244 --> 00:45:05,735
Well, she'll have them.

517
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:09,241
I wish she had asked me something
really impossible.

518
00:45:24,307 --> 00:45:26,098
Doro...

519
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:28,348
Are you hungry?

520
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:33,854
Do you love me?

521
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:37,601
Yes, even half-starved, I love you.

522
00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:40,944
Come.

523
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,196
Sit down. Let me feed you.

524
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:48,330
Here. A sip of this to put you
in a better temper.

525
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:50,579
And, look.

526
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:53,995
I asked Helga to make this especially
for you today.

527
00:45:54,212 --> 00:45:56,251
My darling, was I cruel today?

528
00:45:56,464 --> 00:46:00,331
Oh, you were, my friend. You were indeed.

529
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:02,758
I was almost in tears.

530
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:06,838
- Doro, I'm sorry.
- Niels, don't be sorry.

531
00:46:07,058 --> 00:46:10,391
It's just as it should be.
Don't you see that, my angel?

532
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:15,763
Professionally, we fight like two tigers,
but afterwards...

533
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:19,648
That's what makes it so good afterwards.

534
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:23,111
Isn't it good now?

535
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:28,069
It's wonderful. Why do I forget that
the minute you start to dance?

536
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:32,071
Then I see only my mortal enemy -
the ballerina - in front of me.

537
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:35,411
Because the ballet is your life,
just as it is mine.

538
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:40,089
Don't you think I sometimes forget
you are my husband when I am dancing,

539
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:43,799
and want to kill you
for some of the things you say?

540
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:46,004
You really want to kill me?

541
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:50,267
Of course I do. Isn't that as it should be?

542
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:53,679
I would hate it any other way,
wouldn't you?

543
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:58,973
Oh, Niels, we are lucky,
and I do love you so.

544
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:16,289
I'm sorry about the shoes. I will behave
beautifully this afternoon, you will see.

545
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:21,211
- Sorry about the shoes?
- There was nothing wrong with them.

546
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:25,176
I just did that to torment you.

547
00:47:25,386 --> 00:47:27,426
Oh, you did?

548
00:47:27,638 --> 00:47:30,842
I know exactly how to torment you,
don't I, darling?

549
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:35,186
And you look so wonderfully poetic
when you are in a rage, my dear.

550
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:41,189
Never mind how I look. So you just made
up that little bit about the shoes, huh?

551
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:44,189
But you were being terrible.
You deserved it.

552
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:48,782
You let everyone sit around
while you took your petty revenge?

553
00:47:48,993 --> 00:47:53,489
You forget what you said in front
of the entire company about my dancing?

554
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:56,541
No, I don't. I remember every word of it.

555
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:59,324
- I was right!
- Oh, you were?

556
00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:03,923
Yes, and if you've finished stuffing
yourself, I can say it again

557
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:06,802
because we're going
back to the rehearsal.

558
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:10,297
You danced the waltz
like an elephant in a snowdrift!

559
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:12,557
What did you say?

560
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:16,895
I said you danced the waltz
like an elephant in a snowdrift!

561
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:21,813
No, like an elephant who fell down
and was trying to get up!

562
00:48:22,026 --> 00:48:24,398
Can you hear me? Is that loud enough?

563
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:29,855
How dare you! I slave to make
each step you give me just right.

564
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:34,239
I make your foolish little dance steps
acceptable to an audience.

565
00:48:34,455 --> 00:48:38,749
You don't slave hard enough.
Move in time to the music once in a while!

566
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,622
You are not just cruel, you are heartless.
Completely heartless.

567
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:49,593
You love to say cruel things to me! You
would like to see me grovel at your feet!

568
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:53,504
- You'd see those steps clearer that way!
- How can I stand it?

569
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:55,302
How do I bear it?

570
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:59,516
Come - you can cry harder than that.
I've heard you cry much harder.

571
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,357
That, my girl, is for thinking up
those shoes.

572
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:13,532
On stage, everybody!

573
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:17,742
Let's see what you can think up
for this afternoon's rehearsal.

574
00:49:17,957 --> 00:49:20,282
You've fixed the shoes? Good.

575
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:23,336
- Do you see what he's doing to her?
- Of course.

576
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:29,584
Never interfere between a husband
and wife. It's the best rule I ever heard of.

577
00:49:29,802 --> 00:49:32,471
You mean she's married to him?

578
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,844
- To that man?
- Very much married. Outside, please.

579
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:42,136
No one is allowed in the theatre during
rehearsal. That's another very good rule.

580
00:49:42,356 --> 00:49:45,310
How much do we owe you
for the shoes, my boy?

581
00:49:57,705 --> 00:49:59,614
How could you do it?

582
00:49:59,832 --> 00:50:03,367
How could a girl like you
marry a man like that?

583
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:05,792
How can I help you?

584
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:08,294
<i>Dance! Dance!</i>

585
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:11,425
Dance! Dance!

586
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:13,712
Dance!

587
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:37,074
<i>Help me!</i>

588
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:39,326
<i>Help me!</i>

589
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:41,578
<i>Help me!</i>

590
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:54,966
<i>Help me!</i>

591
00:52:29,732 --> 00:52:31,606
<i>Cobbler?</i>

592
00:52:31,817 --> 00:52:38,781
Cobbler! Thank you for the shoes. You
left before I had a chance to thank you.

593
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,031
They were wonderful.

594
00:52:41,244 --> 00:52:45,241
I really floated on air. Thank you.

595
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,708
Thank you.

596
00:52:58,094 --> 00:53:00,964
Don't tell me what to do!
They'll work tomorrow.

597
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,842
They'll work till they get it right.
I'll see them drop in their tracks.

598
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,476
And you have my coat ready for me
when I'm ready to leave!

599
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:17,487
Home!

600
00:53:36,156 --> 00:53:38,529
What funny people they are over there.

601
00:53:38,742 --> 00:53:44,448
They laugh and kiss, then they scream
and beat each other. Kind of crazy.

602
00:53:46,584 --> 00:53:48,623
What are you doing, Hans?

603
00:53:48,836 --> 00:53:52,205
- Writing.
- A letter? To the children?

604
00:53:52,423 --> 00:53:55,922
- Say something for me to them.
- It's not to the children.

605
00:53:56,135 --> 00:53:59,504
What? Who are you writing to, Hans?

606
00:53:59,722 --> 00:54:01,761
The ballerina.

607
00:54:01,974 --> 00:54:04,346
Stop bothering me, Peter.

608
00:54:07,813 --> 00:54:11,312
Why are you writing
to the ballerina, Hans?

609
00:54:11,525 --> 00:54:16,650
I heard him talk to her.
I saw him slap her face.

610
00:54:16,864 --> 00:54:19,948
But, Hans, they're married.

611
00:54:21,493 --> 00:54:23,533
I know that.

612
00:54:23,746 --> 00:54:26,581
I heard them talking
before you came in, Hans.

613
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:29,460
It was different.

614
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:33,251
Look, Peter, you're a child.
You don't understand.

615
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,628
I saw him make her cry with my own eyes.

616
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:39,214
- But, Hans, they...
- Don't bother me.

617
00:54:39,428 --> 00:54:42,097
I must finish this tonight.

618
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:04,385
<i>"The Little Mermaid.
A story for Mademoiselle Doro.</i>

619
00:55:05,854 --> 00:55:13,316
"And so, gradually, the little mermaid
began to understand.

620
00:55:13,528 --> 00:55:19,364
"She had sought love
from the wrong man."

621
00:55:54,903 --> 00:55:56,943
Come in.

622
00:55:58,448 --> 00:56:02,113
I'm sorry, sir, but he insisted
on seeing you immediately.

623
00:56:02,327 --> 00:56:06,788
Shh. She's asleep. What's the trouble,
doorman? Who's this little boy?

624
00:56:06,999 --> 00:56:12,622
This is addressed to Mademoiselle Doro.
He was in the theatre trying to take it.

625
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:15,839
It seems to be a story,
and it is addressed to her.

626
00:56:16,049 --> 00:56:18,089
Why were you trying to take it?

627
00:56:18,302 --> 00:56:24,138
- I wasn't trying to steal it. It's mine.
- Then why is it addressed to my wife?

628
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:28,810
- Niels, what is all this?
- It's mine! Please give it to me. It's mine!

629
00:56:30,063 --> 00:56:31,937
Now, who wrote this?

630
00:56:32,983 --> 00:56:34,810
I did.

631
00:56:35,027 --> 00:56:37,150
You did?

632
00:56:42,951 --> 00:56:47,031
Suppose you tell me why you happened
to write this story to my wife?

633
00:56:47,247 --> 00:56:49,287
It's nothing to do with you or her.

634
00:56:49,499 --> 00:56:52,749
It's just a story.
He made up a story, that's all.

635
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:56,626
He's always making up stories,
and he made up this one.

636
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,509
Now would you mind telling me
just who he is?

637
00:56:59,718 --> 00:57:04,676
We know you didn't write it, so you might
just as well stop lying. Who is he?

638
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,301
A friend of mine.

639
00:57:06,516 --> 00:57:07,927
What's his name?

640
00:57:08,143 --> 00:57:12,770
Hans... Christian Andersen. The cobbler.

641
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:18,561
Darling, it's the cobbler.

642
00:57:18,779 --> 00:57:22,195
The cobbler who fixed my shoes
so beautifully yesterday.

643
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:25,444
He's written me a story for a ballet.

644
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:29,610
- I don't believe it!
- Tell the cobbler I am delighted to have it.

645
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:32,785
What was his name - Hans?
I will read it carefully.

646
00:57:34,544 --> 00:57:37,296
<i>- The Little Mermaid
- Stop it.</i>

647
00:57:37,506 --> 00:57:40,672
It is all very innocent and quite touching.

648
00:57:43,387 --> 00:57:45,426
I haven't said good morning yet.

649
00:57:46,848 --> 00:57:48,888
Good morning, darling.

650
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:14,113
Where have you been?
I've lost it. I can't find it any place.

651
00:58:14,334 --> 00:58:17,004
Help me look, will you, Peter?

652
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:19,999
Just when I need you most,
you disappear.

653
00:58:20,215 --> 00:58:22,623
I'll have to write it all over again.

654
00:58:22,843 --> 00:58:27,137
- You don't have to write it again.
- Don't stand there. Start looking.

655
00:58:27,347 --> 00:58:30,182
- You don't have to write it over again.
- What?

656
00:58:30,392 --> 00:58:32,016
She's got it.

657
00:58:36,898 --> 00:58:38,938
What did you say?

658
00:58:39,151 --> 00:58:42,235
She has it, Hans. Right now.

659
00:58:42,446 --> 00:58:44,485
She has?

660
00:58:44,698 --> 00:58:46,821
But how? How did she get it?

661
00:58:49,578 --> 00:58:52,495
I was reading it
and it blew out of my hands.

662
00:58:53,665 --> 00:58:55,705
You took it?

663
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:59,168
But why? Never mind that, Peter. Go on.

664
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:02,997
It blew into the window
of the theatre, and...

665
00:59:04,384 --> 00:59:06,424
That's how she got it.

666
00:59:07,638 --> 00:59:09,677
A wind took it to her.

667
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:12,760
It's an omen, Peter. An omen.

668
00:59:14,811 --> 00:59:17,563
She's reading it now.

669
00:59:22,736 --> 00:59:24,775
Don't go over there, Hans, don't.

670
00:59:24,988 --> 00:59:28,274
I must, Peter. I've got to talk to her.
I can help her.

671
00:59:30,577 --> 00:59:34,622
That chair and this sofa.
Let's get 'em on the wagon.

672
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:37,785
What's going on here?
What are you doing?

673
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:39,745
The ballet's moving out.

674
00:59:40,837 --> 00:59:42,877
Moving out?

675
00:59:48,512 --> 00:59:49,970
Excuse me.

676
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:54,723
- Is it true the ballet's moving out?
- That's right. Their yearly tour.

677
00:59:54,935 --> 00:59:57,971
Where to? How long will they be gone?

678
01:00:29,636 --> 01:00:33,219
There's the school bell.
Off to school. Hurry up.

679
01:00:33,432 --> 01:00:37,381
Off with you now. Tomorrow's
another day and another story.

680
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:43,519
I don't want any trouble with
the schoolmaster. Hurry, children. Hurry.

681
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:50,820
What's the matter? Are you unhappy?

682
01:00:54,536 --> 01:00:58,865
Would you like me to tell you
a special story?

683
01:00:59,082 --> 01:01:00,826
Come on up here.

684
01:01:03,337 --> 01:01:05,376
Come on.

685
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:15,845
I'm not going to hurt you.
Go up a little faster.

686
01:01:17,934 --> 01:01:20,888
Now, let me see...

687
01:01:25,233 --> 01:01:30,026
There once was an ugly duckling

688
01:01:30,238 --> 01:01:33,738
With feathers all stubby and brown

689
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:41,116
And the other birds, in so many words
said, "Ptt! Get out of town!

690
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,242
"Ptt! Get out!

691
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:48,881
"Ptt! Ptt! Get out!
Ptt! Ptt! Get out of town!"

692
01:01:49,091 --> 01:01:52,590
And he went with a quack
and a waddle and a quack

693
01:01:52,803 --> 01:01:56,302
In a flurry of eiderdown

694
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:59,887
Shall I tell you the rest of the story?

695
01:02:00,102 --> 01:02:02,141
All right.

696
01:02:03,522 --> 01:02:07,187
That poor little ugly duckling

697
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:10,817
Went wandering far and near

698
01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:14,445
But at every place,
they said to his face

699
01:02:14,658 --> 01:02:18,109
"Now, ptt! Get out of here

700
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:22,037
"Ptt! Get out! Ptt! Ptt! Get out!

701
01:02:22,249 --> 01:02:25,582
"Ptt! Ptt! Get out of here!"

702
01:02:25,794 --> 01:02:29,459
And he went with a quack
and a waddle and a quack

703
01:02:29,673 --> 01:02:33,540
And a very unhappy tear

704
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:46,220
All through the wintertime,
he hid himself away

705
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:52,644
Ashamed to show his face,
afraid of what others might say

706
01:02:52,863 --> 01:02:58,901
All through the winter,
in his lonely clump of weed

707
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:05,122
Till a flock of swans spied him there
and very soon agreed

708
01:03:05,334 --> 01:03:12,048
"You're a very fine swan indeed!"

709
01:03:12,257 --> 01:03:13,586
"A swan?

710
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,338
"Me a swan? Nah, go on."

711
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:21,014
They said, "Yes, you're a swan.
Look at yourself in the lake. You'll see."

712
01:03:21,224 --> 01:03:25,353
<i>And he looked and he saw
and he said, "I am a swan!</i>

713
01:03:25,562 --> 01:03:27,519
"Whee!"

714
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:31,515
I'm not such an ugly duckling

715
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:34,902
No feathers all stubby and brown

716
01:03:35,113 --> 01:03:39,193
For, in fact, these birds,
in so many words said, "Tsk!

717
01:03:39,409 --> 01:03:41,698
"The best in town!

718
01:03:41,912 --> 01:03:44,996
"Tsk! The best! Tsk! Tsk! The best!

719
01:03:45,207 --> 01:03:48,124
"Tsk! Tsk! The best in town!"

720
01:03:48,335 --> 01:03:51,538
Not a quack, not a quack,
not a waddle or a quack

721
01:03:51,755 --> 01:03:56,583
But a glide and a whistle
and a snowy white back

722
01:03:56,802 --> 01:04:02,757
And a head so noble and high

723
01:04:02,975 --> 01:04:07,019
Say who's an ugly duckling?

724
01:04:07,229 --> 01:04:09,554
Not I!

725
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:17,856
Not I!

726
01:04:18,073 --> 01:04:22,450
So, Lars, it shouldn't make any difference
if they won't play with you.

727
01:04:22,661 --> 01:04:25,234
But it does. I want to play with them,

728
01:04:25,455 --> 01:04:30,164
but they make fun of me because I was
sick and the doctor shaved my head.

729
01:04:30,377 --> 01:04:33,580
Yes, but look at what happened
to the ugly duckling.

730
01:04:33,797 --> 01:04:36,253
One day soon, you'll look in the mirror -

731
01:04:36,466 --> 01:04:38,957
much sooner than you think -

732
01:04:39,177 --> 01:04:44,254
and your hair will be grown out,
and you'll be just like the ugly duckling.

733
01:04:44,474 --> 01:04:47,226
You'll be better than any of them,
I promise.

734
01:04:47,436 --> 01:04:51,268
- Are you sure, Hans?
- Very sure.

735
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:55,683
You'd better run off to school.
You're late now.

736
01:04:55,902 --> 01:04:57,942
- Bye, Hans.
- Goodbye.

737
01:05:04,286 --> 01:05:08,034
Cobbler, are my shoes ready?

738
01:05:08,248 --> 01:05:11,498
Yes, ma'am. I have them here.
One mark, please.

739
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:16,502
- One mark? As much as that?
- Yes, ma'am. They're practically new.

740
01:05:18,634 --> 01:05:20,591
How beautiful!

741
01:05:20,802 --> 01:05:22,842
What kind of shoes are they?

742
01:05:23,722 --> 01:05:27,506
Ballet slippers. I made them myself.
Every inch of them.

743
01:05:27,726 --> 01:05:29,765
How lovely they are!

744
01:05:29,978 --> 01:05:33,015
Please, ma'am. They might soil.
You understand.

745
01:05:33,231 --> 01:05:35,271
Who wears such lovely things?

746
01:05:35,484 --> 01:05:39,351
A lady who dances.
Her feet twinkle like little stars.

747
01:05:40,614 --> 01:05:45,406
I assure you, the slippers won't even
be noticed - she's so beautiful herself.

748
01:05:46,912 --> 01:05:48,951
Thank you.

749
01:05:49,873 --> 01:05:52,993
Thank you. Please come again.

750
01:06:39,506 --> 01:06:44,845
Her arms were warm
as they welcomed me

751
01:06:45,053 --> 01:06:49,265
Her eyes were fire-bright

752
01:06:49,808 --> 01:06:54,636
And then I knew that my path must be

753
01:06:54,855 --> 01:07:00,145
Through the ever haunted night

754
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:06,612
For anywhere I wander

755
01:07:06,825 --> 01:07:11,072
Anywhere I roam

756
01:07:11,663 --> 01:07:18,117
Till I'm in the arms of my darling again

757
01:07:18,337 --> 01:07:23,579
My heart will find no home

758
01:07:24,885 --> 01:07:29,879
Anywhere I wander

759
01:07:30,891 --> 01:07:34,805
Anywhere I roam

760
01:08:02,422 --> 01:08:08,046
Anywhere I wander

761
01:08:09,805 --> 01:08:16,638
Anywhere I roam

762
01:08:39,001 --> 01:08:41,918
- You're Hans the cobbler?
- Yes, sir.

763
01:08:42,129 --> 01:08:44,798
- I'm pleased to know you.
- How do you do?

764
01:08:45,007 --> 01:08:47,758
You've no idea what this is
all about, have you?

765
01:08:47,968 --> 01:08:51,253
- No, sir.
- Well, I'm the father of the ugly duckling.

766
01:08:51,471 --> 01:08:56,892
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Oh, you're Lars' father. I see.

767
01:08:57,102 --> 01:09:01,431
That little story helped him
over a bad time. I'm very grateful to you.

768
01:09:01,648 --> 01:09:05,693
When I made inquiries, I found
you had a lot more of these stories.

769
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:10,031
The children are full of them these days.
Do you ever write any of them?

770
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,905
- No, sir.
- Well, I've a little surprise for you. Come.

771
01:09:15,495 --> 01:09:17,737
Give me a small sheet of paper.

772
01:09:40,687 --> 01:09:42,727
Oh!

773
01:09:42,939 --> 01:09:44,979
Oh!

774
01:09:46,443 --> 01:09:49,195
Thank you very much.

775
01:09:53,367 --> 01:09:58,075
- It's the finest present I've ever had.
- I'm delighted. Lars will be, too.

776
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:04,793
Could I say something, sir?
You wouldn't mind?

777
01:10:05,003 --> 01:10:07,838
Of course not. Say anything you want to.

778
01:10:08,048 --> 01:10:11,547
Well, instead of "Hans the cobbler",

779
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,592
could it say "Hans Christian
Andersen", like a real writer?

780
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:17,718
Certainly!

781
01:10:17,933 --> 01:10:23,354
If you write some of those stories down,
just the way you tell them to the children,

782
01:10:23,563 --> 01:10:27,775
I'll print them, and pay you for them.

783
01:10:29,945 --> 01:10:32,566
I can hardly believe it!

784
01:10:33,699 --> 01:10:35,987
- When will this be in the paper?
- Tomorrow.

785
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:41,408
It'll say "Hans Christian Andersen"
all day tomorrow.

786
01:10:41,623 --> 01:10:43,746
All day?

787
01:10:45,627 --> 01:10:48,996
- Well, goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

788
01:10:50,298 --> 01:10:52,338
All day?

789
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:58,211
<i>- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.</i>

790
01:11:04,271 --> 01:11:09,941
<i>"The Ugly Duckling
by Hans Christian Andersen."</i>

791
01:11:11,653 --> 01:11:14,109
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

792
01:11:15,324 --> 01:11:18,159
That fortune has smiled upon

793
01:11:18,368 --> 01:11:22,448
Although I'm a duckling today,
tomorrow I'm a swan

794
01:11:22,664 --> 01:11:27,077
A tale I told and it turned to gold,
as gold as a tale can be

795
01:11:27,294 --> 01:11:31,588
I laugh, ha ha, but I blush a bit
for I realise while I'm reading it

796
01:11:31,798 --> 01:11:33,625
That it's also reading me

797
01:11:33,842 --> 01:11:36,511
"By Hans Christian Andersen"!

798
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,878
<i>I am a swan!</i>

799
01:11:39,097 --> 01:11:42,798
I write myself a note each day
and I place it in my hat

800
01:11:43,018 --> 01:11:46,802
The wind comes by, the hat blows high
but that's not the end of that

801
01:11:47,022 --> 01:11:51,435
For round and round the world it goes
It lands here right behind myself

802
01:11:51,652 --> 01:11:56,195
I pick it up and I read the note
which is merely to remind myself

803
01:11:56,406 --> 01:11:58,446
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

804
01:11:58,659 --> 01:12:00,532
Andersen...

805
01:12:00,744 --> 01:12:02,783
Peter!

806
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:09,086
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

807
01:12:09,294 --> 01:12:11,417
I bring you a fable rare

808
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:16,422
There once was a table who said,
"How I'd love a chair"

809
01:12:16,635 --> 01:12:20,086
And then and there
came a sweet young chair

810
01:12:20,305 --> 01:12:23,223
All dressed in a bridal gown

811
01:12:23,433 --> 01:12:26,600
He said to her in a voice so true

812
01:12:26,812 --> 01:12:31,023
"Now I did not say I would marry you,
but I would like to sit down"

813
01:12:31,233 --> 01:12:33,190
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

814
01:12:33,402 --> 01:12:35,441
Andersen's in town!

815
01:12:40,909 --> 01:12:44,954
<i>"The Ugly Duckling
by... Hans the Cobbler"!</i>

816
01:12:45,163 --> 01:12:47,737
You're looking at a writer. A real writer.

817
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:52,335
Tomorrow, the newspaper will say,
"Hans Christian Andersen" all day!

818
01:12:52,546 --> 01:12:55,333
- Was that what the newspaper wanted?
- Yes.

819
01:12:55,549 --> 01:12:57,956
They've printed one of your stories!

820
01:12:58,176 --> 01:13:02,554
And the way it happened
is like a story in itself. Wait till you hear.

821
01:13:02,764 --> 01:13:06,632
Peter, from now on, if anybody
asks you who you're working for,

822
01:13:06,852 --> 01:13:08,180
you can say a writer.

823
01:13:08,395 --> 01:13:11,598
You are working for a real writer!

824
01:13:15,736 --> 01:13:18,571
<i>"The Ugly Duckling by Hans the Cobbler."</i>

825
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:20,820
I can hardly believe it!

826
01:13:21,033 --> 01:13:23,072
Peter...

827
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:27,489
Can you imagine...

828
01:13:27,706 --> 01:13:30,327
Can you imagine
the schoolmaster's face?

829
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:33,413
One day, a newspaper
arrives from Copenhagen.

830
01:13:33,628 --> 01:13:36,832
He opens it up and he looks,
and suddenly...

831
01:13:37,549 --> 01:13:41,878
He can't believe his eyes!
"Hans Christian Andersen?" he says.

832
01:13:42,095 --> 01:13:44,171
"Hans the cobbler?

833
01:13:44,389 --> 01:13:47,390
"A story by Hans Christian Andersen?

834
01:13:48,602 --> 01:13:51,556
"Hmm. Fine story." Have a bite.

835
01:13:51,772 --> 01:13:56,398
- There's something on your hand.
- That must be from the printing machine.

836
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,445
Peter...

837
01:14:00,656 --> 01:14:02,399
Look.

838
01:14:02,616 --> 01:14:06,910
- "Royal Danish Ballet returns from tour."
- Yes, Peter.

839
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,579
She's back!

840
01:14:08,789 --> 01:14:10,532
Peter, she's back!

841
01:14:10,749 --> 01:14:13,666
What a day!
Everything is happening at once!

842
01:14:14,628 --> 01:14:17,415
Hans, we promised some shoes for today.

843
01:14:17,631 --> 01:14:20,585
I'll do it later. I couldn't possibly sit still.

844
01:14:20,801 --> 01:14:24,300
She's back! I've got to walk! She's back!

845
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:26,649
Never before and never again

846
01:17:26,862 --> 01:17:28,901
Never before and never again

847
01:17:29,114 --> 01:17:31,486
No two people
have ever been so in love

848
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,025
Been so in love

849
01:17:34,244 --> 01:17:36,320
Been so in love - it's incredible

850
01:17:36,538 --> 01:17:42,125
No two people have ever been so in love
As my lovey dove and I

851
01:17:42,336 --> 01:17:46,167
This is unique, the positive peak
We are the most unusual couple on earth

852
01:17:46,381 --> 01:17:51,127
No two people have ever mooned
such a moon, juned such a June

853
01:17:51,345 --> 01:17:52,720
Spooned such a spoon

854
01:17:52,929 --> 01:17:56,464
What he means is that no two people
have ever been so in tune

855
01:17:56,683 --> 01:17:59,601
As my macaroon and I

856
01:17:59,811 --> 01:18:01,222
And when we kiss

857
01:18:01,438 --> 01:18:06,064
- And when we kiss - what verse is this?
- It's hysterical, it's historical

858
01:18:06,276 --> 01:18:08,601
- Let me tell it
- Certainly, darling.

859
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:11,394
No two people
have ever been so in love

860
01:18:11,615 --> 01:18:15,280
Been so in love

861
01:18:15,494 --> 01:18:19,028
It's impossible. No two people
have ever been so in love

862
01:18:19,247 --> 01:18:21,952
As my lovey dove and I

863
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:23,578
This is the cream, the very extreme

864
01:18:23,794 --> 01:18:26,332
The sort of a dream
you couldn't imagine at all

865
01:18:26,546 --> 01:18:33,296
No two people have ever been so in love
as my lovey dove and I

866
01:18:37,432 --> 01:18:41,181
<i>No two people
have ever been so in love</i>

867
01:18:41,395 --> 01:18:44,894
Been so in love, been so in love

868
01:18:45,107 --> 01:18:48,558
No two people have ever been so in love

869
01:18:48,777 --> 01:18:52,561
As you and Mrs Hans Christian
Andersen!

870
01:18:52,781 --> 01:18:54,192
<i>Mrs Andersen.</i>

871
01:18:54,408 --> 01:18:56,365
<i>Mr Andersen.</i>

872
01:18:56,576 --> 01:18:58,368
Mrs Andersen.

873
01:18:58,578 --> 01:19:00,654
Mr Andersen.

874
01:19:01,081 --> 01:19:03,952
Mr Andersen?

875
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:05,994
Mr Andersen?

876
01:19:06,795 --> 01:19:08,835
Mr Andersen?

877
01:19:09,047 --> 01:19:11,087
Mr Andersen?

878
01:19:11,299 --> 01:19:13,339
Mr Andersen!

879
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:17,422
How sweet of you to be here
the very moment we return.

880
01:19:17,639 --> 01:19:20,557
How did you know we were going
to do your ballet?

881
01:19:21,852 --> 01:19:26,763
Never mind. Your real reward will come
tomorrow night when I dance it for you.

882
01:19:26,982 --> 01:19:29,021
You will come, won't you?

883
01:19:31,737 --> 01:19:35,319
Perhaps you will have words for me
by tomorrow night?

884
01:19:35,532 --> 01:19:37,572
Come, Louise.

885
01:19:43,623 --> 01:19:46,079
What would they say back in the village?

886
01:19:46,293 --> 01:19:50,077
You and me getting ready to go
to the opera house in Copenhagen.

887
01:19:50,297 --> 01:19:52,336
To see my ballet!

888
01:19:52,549 --> 01:19:54,874
Would they believe it? Never.

889
01:19:55,093 --> 01:20:00,218
"One of the cobbler's stories", they'd say.
"How can the children believe them?"

890
01:20:00,432 --> 01:20:05,224
But even I wouldn't dare make up a story
like this - and it happens to be true.

891
01:20:06,396 --> 01:20:08,934
Is it all right if I don't go with you?

892
01:20:09,149 --> 01:20:10,560
What?

893
01:20:15,447 --> 01:20:18,614
- I said is it all right if I don't go with you?
- No!

894
01:20:18,825 --> 01:20:24,164
It's not all right if you don't go with me.
What's the matter with you anyway?

895
01:20:24,373 --> 01:20:27,208
Something's wrong with you.

896
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:29,873
Come inside.

897
01:20:42,766 --> 01:20:46,811
Now, what's the matter, Peter?
Come on. Out with it.

898
01:20:49,398 --> 01:20:54,106
I've been trying to tell you
something, Hans, all day.

899
01:20:56,113 --> 01:21:00,193
All right, Peter. Tell me now.

900
01:21:00,409 --> 01:21:04,702
It's hard for me, Hans.
I don't know how to say it.

901
01:21:07,582 --> 01:21:10,667
Never mind. Just say it.

902
01:21:12,587 --> 01:21:15,791
I tried once to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

903
01:21:16,008 --> 01:21:20,136
Then they went away,
and I thought you'd forget about it.

904
01:21:20,345 --> 01:21:23,679
- They?
- I don't like people who laugh at you.

905
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:26,097
It hurts me when people laugh at you.

906
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:30,390
Back in the village when they made
fun of you, I wanted to kill them.

907
01:21:30,605 --> 01:21:34,306
Laugh at me? What are you
talking about, Peter?

908
01:21:34,526 --> 01:21:38,061
Her and him. You don't understand them.

909
01:21:39,448 --> 01:21:41,321
What don't I understand?

910
01:21:41,533 --> 01:21:45,910
You're making up a story about them,
like you do about everything else,

911
01:21:46,121 --> 01:21:50,119
only this time it's about them,
not clocks and flowers and stars.

912
01:21:50,334 --> 01:21:54,118
- She'll laugh at you, Hans!
- So that's it.

913
01:21:54,338 --> 01:21:56,330
I thought so.

914
01:21:57,299 --> 01:22:00,134
Is she laughing at me
when she does my ballet?

915
01:22:00,344 --> 01:22:02,965
Was she laughing at me
when she kissed me?

916
01:22:04,264 --> 01:22:07,051
- She kissed you?
- Yes.

917
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,348
You didn't know that, did you?

918
01:22:11,647 --> 01:22:16,937
- I don't care. It's true what I'm saying.
- I'm sorry you said that, Peter.

919
01:22:17,152 --> 01:22:21,814
You never lied to me before.
You don't have to come with me tonight.

920
01:22:23,784 --> 01:22:28,196
Maybe you'd better see if you can
find work with somebody else.

921
01:22:29,623 --> 01:22:32,992
You're old enough now
to be by yourself, and...

922
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:36,792
...I think we'd better part company
altogether because...

923
01:22:39,341 --> 01:22:42,924
...because I don't think
we like each other any more.

924
01:23:37,691 --> 01:23:39,518
I beg your pardon.

925
01:23:39,735 --> 01:23:42,689
No one's allowed in
before the performance.

926
01:23:42,904 --> 01:23:45,822
I am Hans Christian Andersen.

927
01:23:46,033 --> 01:23:50,161
- The author of the ballet they're doing.
- Oh, good evening.

928
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:53,704
Don't you read the posters
outside your own theatre?

929
01:23:53,915 --> 01:23:58,542
<i>Make it lower.
Up, down again, around - that's it.</i>

930
01:23:58,754 --> 01:24:00,793
That's it.

931
01:24:01,006 --> 01:24:03,045
Stay together.

932
01:24:03,258 --> 01:24:05,963
Around...

933
01:24:06,178 --> 01:24:09,048
Good. That's much better. Keep it up.

934
01:24:09,264 --> 01:24:13,178
That's it. Now go around.
Come around this way.

935
01:24:14,186 --> 01:24:16,309
Who are you? Get out of here at once.

936
01:24:16,521 --> 01:24:20,982
Don't deliver shoes before a performance!
Leave them with the doorman.

937
01:24:21,193 --> 01:24:24,396
- Try the arabesque again.
- The name is Andersen.

938
01:24:24,613 --> 01:24:28,907
- Hans Christian Andersen.
- Andersen? The ballet writer!

939
01:24:29,117 --> 01:24:32,569
I'd like to deliver these shoes
to Mademoiselle Doro.

940
01:24:32,788 --> 01:24:35,029
Be a good fellow and get out now.

941
01:24:35,248 --> 01:24:38,249
- Will you move the big shell upstage?
- Yes, sir.

942
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,081
Go out front and watch your ballet.

943
01:24:41,296 --> 01:24:44,961
- I'll give her the shoes myself.
- No! Don't you touch them.

944
01:24:45,175 --> 01:24:49,125
You can't give them to her now.
No one sees her before an opening.

945
01:24:49,346 --> 01:24:52,133
<i>Can you show us
where you want the shell?</i>

946
01:24:52,349 --> 01:24:56,181
I can't be everywhere at once.
Just move it on stage.

947
01:24:57,562 --> 01:25:01,940
Will you please escort Mr Andersen
to the stage door? Quietly but firmly.

948
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:03,977
But I have these...

949
01:25:04,194 --> 01:25:08,061
If you please, I'd like to leave alone.

950
01:25:25,841 --> 01:25:30,337
Not you again! Don't you understand
this is no time to bother anybody?

951
01:25:30,554 --> 01:25:33,341
Mademoiselle Doro
would not agree with you.

952
01:25:33,557 --> 01:25:37,056
Why am I plagued with authors
on opening nights? Why?

953
01:25:37,269 --> 01:25:41,349
- Overture in three minutes.
- In three minutes, we begin!

954
01:25:41,565 --> 01:25:44,352
Ladies, take your places!

955
01:25:49,573 --> 01:25:52,942
Open that door! Let me out of here!

956
01:26:27,778 --> 01:26:29,817
<i>I can see it.</i>

957
01:26:30,822 --> 01:26:33,492
<i>I don't have to see her with my eyes.</i>

958
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,942
<i>I can see it all.</i>

959
01:41:41,065 --> 01:41:42,559
<i>Come in!</i>

960
01:41:42,775 --> 01:41:45,729
- Good morning, madame.
- Good morning, Céline.

961
01:41:45,945 --> 01:41:50,192
- It's not a very nice day, I'm afraid.
- It looks lovely to me, Céline.

962
01:41:50,408 --> 01:41:54,986
And how good it feels to be
back in my own room. It seems years.

963
01:41:55,204 --> 01:41:58,787
That it does, and what
a wonderful success last night!

964
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,582
I can hardly ever remember
the audience being so excited.

965
01:42:02,795 --> 01:42:05,915
It was the new ballet.
They were enchanted with it.

966
01:42:06,132 --> 01:42:09,880
And it is enchanting. I love to dance it.

967
01:42:10,094 --> 01:42:11,921
What a curious fellow he is.

968
01:42:12,138 --> 01:42:15,222
- He never turned up at all.
- Who, madame?

969
01:42:15,433 --> 01:42:19,015
Hans, the cobbler. You know?

970
01:42:19,228 --> 01:42:24,139
I wonder if he was even there. Do you
suppose he was there and was too shy...

971
01:42:24,358 --> 01:42:27,727
- Good heavens!
- I thought you were fast asleep.

972
01:42:27,945 --> 01:42:32,821
- The cobbler's locked in the prop room!
- What are you talking about?

973
01:42:33,034 --> 01:42:37,078
I locked him up last night,
just before the performance. I had to.

974
01:42:37,288 --> 01:42:41,914
He insisted on giving you some shoes
five minutes before the ballet began.

975
01:42:42,126 --> 01:42:44,961
He never saw the ballet?
You kept him locked up?

976
01:42:45,171 --> 01:42:47,744
- I forgot, I tell you.
- You big fool!

977
01:42:47,965 --> 01:42:51,132
I had other things to think about just then!

978
01:42:51,344 --> 01:42:55,341
Quickly, Céline. Go to the theatre
and bring him back here.

979
01:42:55,556 --> 01:42:57,596
That poor dear man!

980
01:42:58,309 --> 01:43:02,354
And you, you monster,
you'd better stay under there.

981
01:43:02,563 --> 01:43:05,434
Try popping your head out
and see what you get.

982
01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:08,983
The lamp over it, I promise you!

983
01:43:15,117 --> 01:43:17,157
Oh, Hans.

984
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:22,245
I shall call you Hans. What a dreadful
thing to have happened! Are you all right?

985
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:27,001
It's just like him to have done
such a thing. Come.

986
01:43:27,213 --> 01:43:29,252
Sit down.

987
01:43:29,465 --> 01:43:32,466
- Would you like a cup of chocolate?
- No, thank you.

988
01:43:32,677 --> 01:43:36,923
You missed seeing the ballet.
We will do it again two nights from now,

989
01:43:37,139 --> 01:43:38,682
and you will see it then.

990
01:43:38,891 --> 01:43:41,299
- But I did see the ballet.
- You did?

991
01:43:41,519 --> 01:43:42,894
- Yes.
- How?

992
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:46,603
- I thought you were...
- I was, but I could hear the music.

993
01:43:46,816 --> 01:43:49,188
I knew the story the music was telling.

994
01:43:49,402 --> 01:43:52,486
I didn't have to see you dance
with my eyes.

995
01:43:52,697 --> 01:43:55,188
Oh, Hans, how very dear you are,

996
01:43:55,408 --> 01:43:58,527
and how I love to dance it.

997
01:43:58,744 --> 01:44:01,579
I don't know quite why. It's very strange.

998
01:44:01,789 --> 01:44:05,787
Even when we rehearsed it,
I felt something sad and tender.

999
01:44:06,002 --> 01:44:09,916
- I don't know why.
- I know why.

1000
01:44:10,131 --> 01:44:11,625
You do? Tell me.

1001
01:44:13,092 --> 01:44:16,176
- I think it was your answer.
- My answer?

1002
01:44:16,387 --> 01:44:19,257
I let my heart speak to you
with the story, and...

1003
01:44:21,225 --> 01:44:24,890
...last night, you answered me with yours.

1004
01:44:25,813 --> 01:44:31,483
Hans, tell me something. How did you
come to write that story for me?

1005
01:44:32,445 --> 01:44:34,568
How else could I tell you how I felt?

1006
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:37,651
That I knew how miserable
you were with him?

1007
01:44:37,867 --> 01:44:40,322
Miserable? With my husband?

1008
01:44:40,536 --> 01:44:45,412
Yes, I don't think you knew I was there,
but I saw the way he treated you.

1009
01:44:45,624 --> 01:44:47,664
I saw him slap you.

1010
01:44:48,794 --> 01:44:50,538
I heard you cry.

1011
01:44:52,715 --> 01:44:54,838
Oh, Hans...

1012
01:44:56,052 --> 01:45:00,879
- How else could a cobbler speak to you?
- It's arrived, my darling. It's here!

1013
01:45:01,098 --> 01:45:05,807
Good morning, Andersen. Your present,
angel. My apologies for last night.

1014
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:10,065
You must forgive me. It was your ballet
I was thinking of, not you.

1015
01:45:10,274 --> 01:45:15,517
Did you tell him what a great success
it was? For a great lady of the ballet.

1016
01:45:18,115 --> 01:45:24,201
Open it! We shall be poor for the next
year, but I had to have it for you.

1017
01:45:24,413 --> 01:45:28,411
The best part's on the other side.
Turn it over and read it.

1018
01:45:28,626 --> 01:45:31,793
Read it aloud. I'm not a poet like you,
Andersen,

1019
01:45:32,004 --> 01:45:36,049
but once in a while,
even a fool like me can speak of love.

1020
01:45:36,258 --> 01:45:40,256
Are you pleased, my darling?
Read it for me.

1021
01:45:40,471 --> 01:45:42,511
Not now, Niels. Later.

1022
01:45:42,723 --> 01:45:47,184
You're not shy suddenly? Never mind.
You can do anything you wish.

1023
01:45:47,395 --> 01:45:51,143
She danced like an angel.
I could cover you with kisses.

1024
01:45:51,357 --> 01:45:53,599
Please don't, Niels.

1025
01:45:53,818 --> 01:45:56,854
Haven't you forgiven me?
Andersen has, I'm sure.

1026
01:45:57,071 --> 01:46:01,116
She was furious at me for locking you up,
but no harm has been done.

1027
01:46:01,325 --> 01:46:04,990
It's even rather amusing.
Don't you look so stern, my dear.

1028
01:46:05,204 --> 01:46:07,410
You were laughing about it yourself.

1029
01:46:07,623 --> 01:46:11,835
Don't tell me I didn't hear you laughing -
I did. Even under the covers.

1030
01:46:12,044 --> 01:46:15,627
- Be quiet.
- What's the matter with you, Doro?

1031
01:46:16,549 --> 01:46:20,712
Hans, it doesn't matter
why you wrote the story for me.

1032
01:46:20,928 --> 01:46:24,842
It's a beautiful story, whatever the reason.

1033
01:46:25,057 --> 01:46:27,975
It's a lovely and tender story by itself,

1034
01:46:28,185 --> 01:46:32,053
but I shall remember what you told me
every time I dance it.

1035
01:46:33,941 --> 01:46:37,606
- Andersen, we haven't paid you for it.
- Niels, do be quiet.

1036
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:41,604
We want to pay him, don't we?
We'd like you to write more for us.

1037
01:46:41,824 --> 01:46:46,984
- Have you any other stories we can use?
- No. That one was just an accident.

1038
01:46:47,204 --> 01:46:49,909
I don't think I'll be writing any more.

1039
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:53,627
I guess it's all right to deliver these now.

1040
01:46:53,836 --> 01:46:56,505
Some shoes from the cobbler.

1041
01:46:56,714 --> 01:46:58,956
Thank you, Hans.

1042
01:46:59,175 --> 01:47:04,549
- But, Andersen, I...
- Niels, let him go. Goodbye, Hans.

1043
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:15,479
Doro...

1044
01:47:15,691 --> 01:47:18,894
Doro, what is it, my darling?

1045
01:47:57,566 --> 01:47:59,642
Peter!

1046
01:48:01,112 --> 01:48:04,528
Peter! Peter!

1047
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:06,649
Peter!

1048
01:48:19,171 --> 01:48:21,211
Hello, Peter.

1049
01:48:26,053 --> 01:48:28,627
Do you mind if I walk along beside you?

1050
01:48:31,684 --> 01:48:33,723
I don't see how I can help it.

1051
01:48:33,936 --> 01:48:39,606
We both seem to be going in the same
direction, and there's only one road.

1052
01:48:43,362 --> 01:48:45,853
Are you going back to the village?

1053
01:48:50,202 --> 01:48:52,776
I'm going back to the village, too.

1054
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:58,374
Bread and butter!
And you know something, Peter?

1055
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:03,882
I'm never telling another story -
not even to myself.

1056
01:49:04,091 --> 01:49:06,131
I've told my last story, Peter.

1057
01:49:06,344 --> 01:49:08,383
Especially to myself.

1058
01:49:08,596 --> 01:49:11,265
Cobbler, stick to your last.

1059
01:49:11,474 --> 01:49:15,341
If any man ever learned his lesson
and learned it good, it's me.

1060
01:49:16,729 --> 01:49:19,849
- I think you'll go on telling stories.
- No, I won't.

1061
01:49:20,066 --> 01:49:21,809
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

1062
01:49:22,026 --> 01:49:23,853
Why do you keep on saying that?

1063
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:26,940
Why? Because
you're Hans Christian Andersen.

1064
01:49:28,115 --> 01:49:30,357
That's why!

1065
01:49:33,037 --> 01:49:35,076
Peter!

1066
01:49:37,667 --> 01:49:40,952
<i>You'll tell stories.
You'll write stories.</i>

1067
01:49:41,170 --> 01:49:43,542
You'll even sing stories.

1068
01:49:43,756 --> 01:49:47,006
Over and over and over again.

1069
01:49:51,097 --> 01:49:54,300
I'm not such an ugly duckling

1070
01:49:54,517 --> 01:49:57,268
No feathers all stubby and brown

1071
01:49:57,478 --> 01:50:00,598
For, in fact, these birds,
in so many words

1072
01:50:00,815 --> 01:50:03,484
Said, "Tsk! The best in town!

1073
01:50:03,693 --> 01:50:06,729
"Tsk! The best! Tsk! Tsk! The best!"

1074
01:50:06,946 --> 01:50:10,066
Remember your trip
to Copenhagen? Tell us about it!

1075
01:50:10,282 --> 01:50:15,657
Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen

1076
01:50:15,871 --> 01:50:19,371
Friendly old girl of a town

1077
01:50:19,583 --> 01:50:21,327
'Neath her tavern light

1078
01:50:21,544 --> 01:50:28,425
On this merry night,
let us clink and drink one down

1079
01:50:28,634 --> 01:50:33,343
To wonderful, wonderful
Copenhagen...

1080
01:50:33,556 --> 01:50:36,972
<i>- Tell us about the king! The king!
- Yes, the king!</i>

1081
01:50:37,184 --> 01:50:40,968
The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

1082
01:50:41,188 --> 01:50:44,189
He's altogether as naked
as the day that he was born

1083
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:47,317
The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

1084
01:50:47,528 --> 01:50:50,280
It's altogether the very least
the king has ever worn

1085
01:50:50,489 --> 01:50:53,490
<i>Call the court physician,
call an intermission...</i>

1086
01:50:53,701 --> 01:50:56,322
Hans! My favourite, huh?

1087
01:50:57,204 --> 01:50:58,996
<i>Thumbelina!</i>

1088
01:51:01,167 --> 01:51:03,918
Though you're no bigger
than my thumb

1089
01:51:04,128 --> 01:51:08,873
- Than my thumb
- Than my thumb

1090
01:51:09,091 --> 01:51:12,128
- Sweet Thumbelina, don't be glum
- Don't be glum

1091
01:51:12,345 --> 01:51:15,132
- Now, now, now
- Ah, ah, ah, come along

1092
01:51:15,348 --> 01:51:19,476
Everybody!
Thumbelina, Thumbelina, tiny little thing

1093
01:51:19,685 --> 01:51:23,137
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing

1094
01:51:23,356 --> 01:51:27,400
Thumbelina, what's the difference
if you're very small?

1095
01:51:27,610 --> 01:51:35,190
When your heart is full of love,
you're nine feet tall!

1096
01:51:35,409 --> 01:51:38,494
<i>Hans Christian Andersen!</i>
