1
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,573
Did you see what I saw?

2
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,326
Come on, Joe. Open her up.
We're gonna have a big day today.

3
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,452
Come on, get the door open.

4
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,211
- You in a hurry?
- Yeah, I sure am.

5
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,881
You're a fool. Come on.

6
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:14,889
All right, all right,
ladies and gentlemen, let us begin.

7
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:19,101
Now, will the bride and groom
kindly step forward?

8
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:24,148
Will Kane and Amy Fowler,

9
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:28,819
you appear before me in my capacity
as justice of the peace of this township

10
00:04:28,944 --> 00:04:32,615
to be joined together
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

11
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:43,501
- Man, it sure is hot.
- Hot? You call this hot?

12
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,631
Well, I'll be...

13
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,092
- What's the matter?
- Thought I saw Ben Miller.

14
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,261
- He's down in Texas somewhere.
- I know.

15
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,597
Looked like Pierce and Colby, too.

16
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:58,516
It couldn't be, though.

17
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,621
My goodness gracious.

18
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:30,339
- Noon train on time?
- Yes, sir.

19
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:32,424
At least, I think so, sir.

20
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,262
Don't know a reason
why it shouldn't be, Mr Pierce.

21
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:41,976
How are you, Mr Miller?
Mr Pierce? Mr Colby?

22
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:20,598
Do you, Will Kane,
take Amy to be your lawful wedded wife,

23
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:24,643
to have and to hold from this day
forward until death do you part?

24
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:26,562
I do.

25
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,648
Do you, Amy, take Will
to be your lawful wedded husband,

26
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:34,403
to have and to hold from this day
forward until death do you part?

27
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:35,738
I do.

28
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,574
The ring, please.

29
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:48,500
Then, by the authority vested in me
by the laws of this territory,

30
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,795
I pronounce you man and wife.

31
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:02,164
I can't speak for the rest of you men,
but I claim an ancient privilege.

32
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,565
Moving mighty fast for a Sunday.

33
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:16,653
Will!

34
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,115
All those people.

35
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:24,620
Amy, seems to me like people ought to
be alone when they get married.

36
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,080
I know.

37
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:30,709
I'm going to try, Amy. I'll do my best.

38
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:33,420
I will, too.

39
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,846
The honeymoon is officially over.
Come on, everybody.

40
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:44,431
And don't look so shocked.

41
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,142
No way to treat a man
on his honeymoon day, is it?

42
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,896
Well, one more ceremony
and Will's a free man,

43
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,898
more or less.

44
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:55,067
Well, Marshal, turn in your badge.

45
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:58,904
To tell you the truth, I kind of hate to do
this without your new marshal being here.

46
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:03,450
Will, Fuller, Howe and I are the entire
Board of Selectmen of this community.

47
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:05,786
We're also your very good friends.

48
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:08,580
With the fine job you've done here,
I feel free to say,

49
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:12,543
and the judge will bear me out,
this town will be safe till tomorrow.

50
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:15,379
You win.

51
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,799
But don't ever marry a Quaker.
She'll have you running a store.

52
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:21,802
- I can't picture you doing that, Will.
- I can.

53
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:24,930
So can I. And a good thing, too.

54
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,306
Thank you.

55
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,102
You didn't talk that way
when you were wearing a star.

56
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:35,107
All right, it's coming off.
But I got to be paid first.

57
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,986
Let me down!

58
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:42,865
- Not till you kiss me.
- Let me down, you fool.

59
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,756
Nice delaying action, Will.
You should've been a lawyer.

60
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:01,884
- I was cut out for bigger sport.
- Marshal.

61
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,760
Marshal, telegram for you.

62
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:08,307
It's terrible. It's shocking.

63
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,060
They've pardoned Frank Miller.

64
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,104
- What is it, Will?
- I don't believe it.

65
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:18,233
A week ago, too.
Nice of them to let you know.

66
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:19,735
And that ain't all.

67
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,821
Ben Miller's down at the depot now
with Jim Pierce and Jack Colby.

68
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,782
- He asked about the noon train.
- The noon train?

69
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:32,497
Will, you get out of this town.

70
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,125
Get out of this town this very minute.

71
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,501
- Come on, let's get him going.
- What is it?

72
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:37,669
Never mind that now.

73
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,213
Just get going and don't stop
till you get to Clarksburg.

74
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,381
But what is it, Mr Howe?

75
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:42,591
Don't you worry, madam.

76
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,093
You'll be out of town
in a minute and everything'll be all right.

77
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,637
Go on, Will,
we'll take care of everything.

78
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:48,138
I think I ought to stay.

79
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:50,182
Are you crazy? Think of Amy.

80
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,562
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Amy.

81
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:58,398
Don't you worry.
Everything will be all right.

82
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:00,442
- Well done, boy.
- Hurry.

83
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:20,921
Huh. That's funny.

84
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:24,633
What?

85
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,593
Well, you can't see now.

86
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,721
Kane and his new wife
just took off in a big hurry.

87
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,350
- What's so funny?
- I mean a big hurry.

88
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:38,730
Hey, you don't suppose Kane's scared
of those three gunnies?

89
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:45,070
Well, you didn't see him.
I never saw him whip a horse that way.

90
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:59,543
- Sam!
- Come in, Helen.

91
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:03,755
Ben Miller is in town.
He has two of the old bunch with him.

92
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,595
I guess I'll take a look around.

93
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,977
- Why are you stopping?
- It's no good. I've got to go back, Amy.

94
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,604
Why?

95
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:02,439
This is crazy.
I haven't even got any guns.

96
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:04,608
Then let's go on. Hurry.

97
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:07,903
No, that's what I've been thinking.

98
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:11,573
They're making me run.
I've never run from anybody before.

99
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:15,493
- Well, I don't understand any of this.
- Well, I haven't got time to tell you.

100
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:19,539
- Then don't go back, Will.
- I've got to. That's the whole thing.

101
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,437
- Kane's back.
- I don't believe it.

102
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:25,980
I just seen him.

103
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,528
- How many coffins we got?
- Two.

104
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:34,114
We're going to need at least two more
no matter how you figure.

105
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:36,032
You'd better get busy, Fred.

106
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:42,997
Please, Will, if you'd just tell me
what this is all about.

107
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:46,209
I sent a man up five years ago
for murder.

108
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,002
He was supposed to hang.

109
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:52,006
But up north, they commuted it to life.
Now he's free.

110
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,260
I don't know how.
Anyway, it looks like he's coming back.

111
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:57,011
- I still don't understand.
- He's a...

112
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,724
Well, he was always wild, kind of crazy.
He'll probably make trouble.

113
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:05,478
But that's no concern of yours,
not anymore.

114
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:08,398
I'm the one who sent him up.

115
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,191
Well, that was part of your job.

116
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,361
That's finished now.
They've got a new marshal.

117
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:17,699
He won't be here till tomorrow.
Seems to me I've got to stay.

118
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,119
Anyway, I'm the same man,
with or without this.

119
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:22,745
Well, that isn't so.

120
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,581
I expect he'll come looking for me.

121
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:26,749
Three of his old bunch are waiting
at the depot.

122
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,835
That's exactly why we ought to go.

123
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,629
They'll just come after us. Four of them.

124
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:34,340
And we'd be all alone on the prairie.

125
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:36,301
We've got an hour.

126
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,927
- What's an hour?
- Well, we could...

127
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:41,014
What's 100 miles? We'd never be able
to keep that store, Amy.

128
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,808
They'd come after us and we'd have to
run again as long as we live.

129
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:47,312
No, we wouldn't.
Not if they didn't know where to find us.

130
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:52,400
Oh, Will.
Will, I'm begging you, please let's go.

131
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,568
I can't.

132
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,946
Don't try to be a hero.
You don't have to be a hero. Not for me.

133
00:14:57,071 --> 00:15:01,367
I'm not trying to be a hero.
If you think I like this, you're crazy.

134
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:04,412
Look, Amy, this is my town.
I've got friends here.

135
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:06,372
I'll swear in a bunch of special deputies

136
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:09,083
and with a posse behind me,
maybe there won't even be any trouble.

137
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,588
- You know there'll be trouble.
- Then it's better to have it here.

138
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,262
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you feel about it.

139
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,847
Do you?

140
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:25,850
Of course I do.
I know it's against your religion and all.

141
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,896
- Sure I know how you feel.
- But you're doing it just the same.

142
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:35,276
Oh, Will, we were married
just a few minutes ago.

143
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:39,614
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

144
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:43,409
You know I've only got an hour
and I've got lots to do.

145
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,029
- Stay at the hotel until it's over.
- No, I won't be here when it's over.

146
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:52,835
You're asking me to wait an hour to find
out if I'm going to be a wife or a widow.

147
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:56,306
- I say it's too long to wait. I won't do it.
- Amy!

148
00:15:56,431 --> 00:16:00,802
I mean it, if you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.

149
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,138
I've got to stay.

150
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,455
- Glad you got here, Perce.
- Are you?

151
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,805
Have you forgotten that I'm the man
who passed sentence on Frank Miller?

152
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:50,059
You shouldn't have come back, Will.
It was stupid.

153
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:53,729
I figured I had to. I figured I had to stay.

154
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,398
You figured wrong.

155
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:58,276
I can deputise a posse.
Ten, 12 guns is all I need.

156
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,736
Yeah, my intuition tells me otherwise.

157
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,321
Why?

158
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,993
No time for a lesson in civics, my boy.

159
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:09,954
In the fifth century B.C.,
the citizens of Athens,

160
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,749
having suffered grievously under a tyrant,
managed to depose and banish him.

161
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,085
However, when he returned
some years later

162
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:20,965
with an army of mercenaries, those same
citizens not only opened the gates for him,

163
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,927
but stood by while he executed
members of the legal government.

164
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:31,476
A similar thing happened about eight
years ago in a town called Indian Falls.

165
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:35,563
I escaped death
only through the intercession of a lady

166
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,149
of somewhat dubious reputation,

167
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:42,361
and at the cost of a very handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother.

168
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:46,073
- Unfortunately, I have no more rings.
- You're a judge.

169
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:49,327
I've been a judge many times
in many towns.

170
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:52,163
And I hope to live to be a judge again.

171
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,041
I can't tell you what to do.

172
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,127
Why must you be so stupid, Will?
Have you forgotten what he is?

173
00:17:58,252 --> 00:17:59,629
Have you forgotten
what he's done to people?

174
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:01,464
Have you forgotten that he's crazy?

175
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:03,674
Don't you remember
when he sat in that chair and said,

176
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,344
"You'll never hang me. I'll come back.

177
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:09,430
"I'll kill you, Will Kane.
I swear it, I'll kill you"?

178
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,148
Here you are, ma'am.
This'll take you to Saint Louis.

179
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:20,441
Thank you.

180
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:29,575
Maybe you'd rather wait somewheres else.

181
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,285
Like at the hotel, maybe.

182
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,662
All right, thank you.

183
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:34,997
I'm awfully sorry
about all this, Mrs Kane.

184
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:38,417
But don't you worry, the marshal
will take care of himself all right.

185
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,127
Thank you very much.

186
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,965
Hey, that wasn't here five years ago.

187
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:45,967
So what?

188
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,928
Nothing. Yet.

189
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:57,812
Harvey, don't you think Kane
will be looking for you about now?

190
00:18:58,062 --> 00:18:59,063
Yeah.

191
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:01,649
You're really sore at him.

192
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,442
Wouldn't you be if you were me?

193
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,569
I suppose. If I were you.

194
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:16,247
Be back in a little while.

195
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,979
- Bye, Will.
- Goodbye.

196
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:44,150
- Think I'm letting you down, don't you?
- No.

197
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,570
Look, this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere.

198
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:51,115
Nothing that happens here
is really important. Now get out.

199
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:53,200
There isn't time.

200
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:56,996
What a waste. Good luck.

201
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,426
Johnny.

202
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:16,390
- Why aren't you in church?
- Why ain't you?

203
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:18,726
- Look, will you do something for me?
- Sure.

204
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,811
Go find Joe Henderson,
Mart Howe and Sam Fuller

205
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:22,646
- and tell them I want them here.
- Right.

206
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:26,108
- And then find Harv Pell.
- Don't have to do that, here I am.

207
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,486
- Well, where have you been?
- Busy.

208
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:31,155
- You know what's doing?
- Sure.

209
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,406
Well, come on, we got lots to do.

210
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,285
Hold up a second.
This ain't really your job, you know.

211
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:37,912
Well, that's what everybody
keeps telling me.

212
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,873
When I tell you, it means something,
so you can just listen a second.

213
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:42,500
All right, I'm listening.

214
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,502
Now, this is the way I see it.

215
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,463
If you'd gone, with the new marshal
not due here till tomorrow,

216
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:49,340
I'd be in charge around here, right?

217
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:50,633
Right.

218
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:54,845
Well, tell me this, then, if I'm good enough
to hold down the job when there's trouble,

219
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,306
how come the city fathers
didn't trust me with it permanent?

220
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,183
I don't know.

221
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:01,519
- Don't you?
- No.

222
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:03,687
That's funny, I figured
you carried a lot of weight.

223
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:08,067
Maybe they didn't ask me.
Maybe they figured you were too young.

224
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:09,777
You think I'm too young, too?

225
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,071
You sure act like it sometimes.
Come on.

226
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:22,873
It's very simple, Will.

227
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:26,168
All you gotta do is tell the old boys
when they come that I'm the new marshal.

228
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:30,839
And tomorrow they can tell the other fellow
they're sorry, but the job's filled.

229
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:33,634
- You really mean it, don't you?
- Sure.

230
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:38,639
- Well, I can't do it.
- Why not?

231
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:41,517
If you don't know,
it's no use me telling you.

232
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:42,810
You mean you won't do it.

233
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,728
Have it your way.

234
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:48,315
All right, the truth is you probably
talked against me from the start.

235
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,445
You've been sore about me and
Helen Ramírez right along, ain't you?

236
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:56,365
You and Helen Ramírez?

237
00:21:57,866 --> 00:22:01,704
It so happens I didn't know, and it doesn't
mean anything to me one way or the other.

238
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:02,913
You ought to know that.

239
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,124
Yeah, you been washed up
for more than a year.

240
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:07,126
Oh, you go out and get yourself married,

241
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:10,045
only you can't stand anybody
taking your place there, can you?

242
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,506
- Especially me.
- You're a...

243
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:20,848
I haven't got time, Harv.

244
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,559
Okay, then let's get down to business.

245
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,395
You want me to stick,
you put the word in for me like I said.

246
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,105
Sure, I want you to stick.

247
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,983
But I'm not buying it.
It's got to be up to you.

248
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:07,978
I thought you'd grew up by now.

249
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:12,858
I thought your disposition might have
sweetened up a little down in Abilene.

250
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:14,818
I guess we're both wrong.

251
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:24,203
What's so funny?

252
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:27,664
Did you really think
you could put that over on Kane?

253
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,791
Why not?

254
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:30,876
When are you going to grow up?

255
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:32,711
I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.

256
00:23:32,836 --> 00:23:35,130
- Then grow up.
- Cut it out!

257
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,678
All right.

258
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,348
Why shouldn't he have gone for it?
He needs me.

259
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,308
He'll need me plenty
when Frank Miller gets here.

260
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:47,476
That's possible.

261
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,144
Should've had me made marshal
to begin with.

262
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,730
He's just sore, is all.
Sore about you and me.

263
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,815
- Is he?
- Sure.

264
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,777
- You told him?
- Sure.

265
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,946
You are a fool.

266
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:03,700
Why? Didn't you want him to know?

267
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:09,706
Hey, who did the walking out, anyway?
You or him?

268
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:15,671
Get out, Harvey.

269
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,508
- I might just do that.
- Then do it.

270
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,429
- You don't mean that?
- Try me.

271
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,433
You're gonna talk different
when Frank Miller gets here.

272
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,812
You might want somebody around you then
when you try to explain to him about Kane.

273
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,981
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

274
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:37,901
Only from what I've heard, you might not be
so pretty when he gets through with you.

275
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,741
- I won't be back.
- Good.

276
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,130
Come in.

277
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:02,426
I just saw Harvey. Is everything all right?

278
00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:05,429
I think I have to talk with Mr Weaver.

279
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:09,558
- You're getting out?
- Yes.

280
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,893
You want me to give Kane a hand?

281
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,194
- No.
- All right.

282
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:33,749
May I wait here for the noon train?

283
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,671
I said, may I wait in the lobby
until noon?

284
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,758
Sure, lady.

285
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,551
Thank you.

286
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:49,639
- You're Mrs Kane, ain't you?
- Yes.

287
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:52,184
- You're leaving on the noon train?
- Yes.

288
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:53,727
But your husband ain't?

289
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:55,520
No. Why?

290
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:57,731
No reason, but it's mighty interesting.

291
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:02,944
Now, me, I wouldn't leave this town
at noon for all the tea in China.

292
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,448
No, sir. It's going to be
quite a sight to see.

293
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,302
- Will, I just heard about...
- Hello, Herb.

294
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,805
You can count on me.
You know that, don't you?

295
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:13,974
I was figuring I could.

296
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,435
The way you cleaned this town up, you
made it fit for women and kids to live in.

297
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:19,854
Miller nor nobody else
will ever drag it down again.

298
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,023
I was hoping people would feel that way.

299
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:25,026
What other way is there?
How many men you got lined up?

300
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:28,238
None, yet.

301
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:32,242
Well, you better get going, man.

302
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,620
I'll be back in 10 minutes,
loaded and prepared.

303
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:08,528
Where is he?

304
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,891
He's coming up the back way.
There's a careful man.

305
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:19,497
Come in, Mr Weaver.

306
00:28:19,622 --> 00:28:20,665
- Hello, Mrs Ramírez.
- Hello.

307
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,459
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.

308
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:28,006
- Is there anything wrong, Mrs Ramírez?
- No.

309
00:28:28,131 --> 00:28:29,466
Then why did you send for me?

310
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:32,135
I'm leaving town. I want to sell the store.

311
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,305
- You want to buy me out?
- Well, how much did you want?

312
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:37,807
$2,000. I think that's fair.

313
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,312
Well, it's fair, all right,
but I couldn't raise that much right now.

314
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:46,066
- How much can you raise?
- Oh, $1,000.

315
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:51,821
All right.
You can pay Sam the rest in six months

316
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:54,199
and he'll get it to me. A deal?

317
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:56,117
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:59,662
All right, Mr Weaver. Thank you.

319
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:04,918
Mrs Ramírez, I want
to thank you for everything.

320
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:08,797
I mean, when you first called me in
and put the deal to me about

321
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:12,050
staking me in the store
and being a silent partner.

322
00:29:12,175 --> 00:29:13,635
You know, my wife thought...

323
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:22,060
What I really mean to say is that you've
been real decent to me right along.

324
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:24,479
And I want you to know
that I've been honest with you.

325
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,065
I know you have, Mr Weaver. Goodbye.

326
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,777
Goodbye, Mrs Ramírez,
and good luck to you.

327
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:31,903
Thank you.

328
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,585
- Oh, Will.
- Amy.

329
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,504
You've changed your mind.

330
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:53,716
I thought you had changed yours.

331
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:58,930
No, Will, I have my ticket.

332
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,018
I see.

333
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:08,606
Open 19 and clean it up good.
Mr Miller's very particular.

334
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:11,568
- Is Helen Ramírez in?
- I guess so.

335
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:15,446
Think you can find it all right?

336
00:30:25,832 --> 00:30:26,958
Come in.

337
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:42,432
What are you looking at?
You think I have changed?

338
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:48,479
Well, what do you want?

339
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:51,608
You want me to help you?
You want me to ask Frank to let you go?

340
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:53,443
You want me to beg for you?

341
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:56,696
Well, I would not do it.
I would not lift a finger for you.

342
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,407
I came to tell you he was coming.

343
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:01,451
I should have figured
you'd know about it.

344
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,703
I know about it.

345
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,748
I think you ought to get out of town.
I might not be able to... Well,

346
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:11,044
- anything can happen.
- I am not afraid of him.

347
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,631
I know you're not,
but you know how he is.

348
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:19,177
I know how he is.

349
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:23,639
Maybe he doesn't know.

350
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,477
- He's probably got letters.
- Probably.

351
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:31,731
Nothing in life is free.

352
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:37,653
- I'm getting out. I'm packing now.
- That's good.

353
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,296
Goodbye, Helen.

354
00:31:55,421 --> 00:32:00,510
Kane, if you're smart,
you will get out, too.

355
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:04,514
- I can't.
- I know.

356
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:38,464
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

357
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:42,176
- Who is Miss Ramírez?
- Mrs Ramírez?

358
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:46,639
She used to be a friend
of your husband's a while back.

359
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,975
Before that, she was a friend
of Frank Miller's.

360
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:52,478
I see. Thank you.

361
00:32:55,565 --> 00:32:58,568
- You don't like my husband, do you?
- No.

362
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:01,404
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

363
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:04,740
One thing, this place was always busy
when Frank Miller was around.

364
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,659
I'm not the only one.

365
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:10,621
There's plenty people around here
think he's got a comeuppance coming.

366
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:13,457
You asked me, ma'am, so I'm telling you.

367
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:37,815
You know, I think I'll go get some liquor.

368
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,818
- Do you have to have it?
- Yeah.

369
00:33:40,943 --> 00:33:44,322
- If you're going after that woman...
- I said I was going for liquor.

370
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:47,533
- You keep away from Kane.
- Sure, I can wait.

371
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:03,466
Hiya, Harvey.

372
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,855
- Hello, Harv.
- How are you?

373
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,026
- Where's the tin star?
- I turned it in. I quit.

374
00:34:22,151 --> 00:34:23,778
Smart move.

375
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:27,114
I didn't ask you for your opinion.

376
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:57,353
Hey, Ben! Hey, how are you, Ben?

377
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:00,815
Look who's here.

378
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:04,944
- How are you, Ben?
- All right, give me a bottle.

379
00:35:05,444 --> 00:35:06,946
Sure thing.

380
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:12,743
- It's been a long time, Ben.
- Yeah.

381
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:14,912
Yes, sir. How's Frank?

382
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:18,124
He's not complaining.

383
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:22,128
Well, there'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight, eh, Ben?

384
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,257
I wouldn't be surprised.

385
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:23,439
I'll give you odds. Kane's dead five
minutes after Frank gets off the train.

386
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:27,318
- That's not much time.
- That's all Frank'll need because I...

387
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:44,084
You carry a badge and a gun, Marshal.

388
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,170
You had no call to do that.

389
00:36:48,464 --> 00:36:49,715
You're right.

390
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:53,677
No.

391
00:37:04,063 --> 00:37:06,023
I guess you all know why I'm here.

392
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:09,526
I need deputies. I'll take all I can get.

393
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:16,533
You must be crazy coming in here
to raise a posse.

394
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:19,745
Frank's got friends in this room.
You ought to know that.

395
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,833
Some of you were special deputies
when we broke this bunch.

396
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:27,211
I need you again. Now.

397
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:30,923
Things were different then, Kane.

398
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,759
You had six steady deputies
to start off with.

399
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:37,846
Every one a top gun.
You ain't got but two now.

400
00:37:38,138 --> 00:37:42,226
You ain't got two.
Harv Pell here says he just quit. Why?

401
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:47,231
That's between the two of us.

402
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:51,068
You're asking an awful lot, Kane,
considering the kind of man Frank Miller is.

403
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:54,613
All right, we all know what Miller's like.

404
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:57,408
That's why I'm here. How about it?

405
00:39:06,685 --> 00:39:10,063
Mildred. Mildred, he's coming.
Now, you do like I told you.

406
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:13,358
I'm not home. Don't let him in.
No matter what he says, I'm not home.

407
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:14,693
Sam, he's your friend.

408
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:16,987
Don't argue with me.
He'll be here in a second.

409
00:39:17,112 --> 00:39:19,072
He won't believe me.
He'll know I'm lying.

410
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:20,616
You do like I tell you.

411
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:41,887
- Hello, Mrs Fuller, is Sam in?
- No. No, he isn't.

412
00:39:44,598 --> 00:39:47,893
Do you know where he is, Mrs Fuller?
It's important to me that I find him.

413
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:52,481
I think... He's in church, Will.
He's gone to church.

414
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:55,943
Without you?

415
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:58,403
I'm gonna go in a little while,
as soon as I dress.

416
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:07,329
Thank you, Mrs Fuller. Goodbye.

417
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:34,690
Now, what do you want?
Do you want me to get killed?

418
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:37,109
Do you want to be a widow?
Is that what you want?

419
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,069
No, Sam, no.

420
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:41,196
Kane.

421
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,953
- What's the matter, Jimmy?
- Nothing. I've been looking for you.

422
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,707
I want a gun. I want to be with you
when that train comes in.

423
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:57,337
- Can you handle a gun?
- Sure I can. I used to be good.

424
00:40:57,587 --> 00:40:59,089
- Honest.
- But why...

425
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:01,842
It ain't just getting even.
It's a chance, see? It's what I need.

426
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:04,302
Please, Kane, let me get in on this.

427
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,432
All right, Jimmy,
I'll call you if I need you.

428
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:11,101
Get yourself a drink meanwhile, huh?

429
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,156
Come in, Sam.

430
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:33,039
You're leaving town?

431
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:37,461
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

432
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,505
That doesn't make much sense.

433
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:46,136
You're afraid, huh? Afraid of Miller?

434
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:47,804
No.

435
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:50,056
Sure you are, or you wouldn't be running.

436
00:41:50,182 --> 00:41:53,393
You got nothing to be worried about
as long as I'm around. You know that.

437
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:55,770
I'm not scared of Miller.
I'll take him on any time.

438
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:57,314
I believe you.

439
00:41:57,814 --> 00:41:59,274
Then why are you going?

440
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:02,527
- You cutting out with Kane?
- Oh, Harvey.

441
00:42:02,652 --> 00:42:04,779
- Then why are you going?
- What difference does it make?

442
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:06,156
It's Kane. It's Kane, I know it's Kane.

443
00:42:06,406 --> 00:42:11,369
It isn't Kane, but I'm going to tell you
something about you and your friend Kane.

444
00:42:11,494 --> 00:42:12,871
You're a good-looking boy.

445
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:16,583
You have big, broad shoulders,
but he is a man.

446
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:19,502
It takes more than big, broad shoulders
to make a man, Harvey,

447
00:42:19,628 --> 00:42:21,671
and you have a long way to go.

448
00:42:23,715 --> 00:42:26,509
You know something?
I don't think you will ever make it.

449
00:42:29,137 --> 00:42:31,306
Let me tell you something.
You're not going anywhere.

450
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:34,935
You're staying here with me.
It's going to be just like it was before.

451
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:41,983
You want to know why I'm leaving?
Then listen.

452
00:42:42,817 --> 00:42:47,197
Kane will be a dead man in half an hour,
and nobody is going to do anything about it.

453
00:42:47,322 --> 00:42:51,493
And when he dies, this town dies, too.
I can feel it.

454
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:53,536
I am all alone in the world.

455
00:42:53,662 --> 00:42:57,999
I have to make a living.
So I'm going someplace else. That's all.

456
00:43:02,003 --> 00:43:05,423
And as for you, I don't like anybody
to put his hands on me

457
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:06,716
unless I want him to.

458
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:09,636
And I don't like you to anymore.

459
00:43:26,695 --> 00:43:29,990
Our text today is from Malachi,
Chapter Four.

460
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,035
"For, behold, the day cometh,
that shall burn as an oven,

461
00:43:34,494 --> 00:43:37,706
"and all the proud, yea,
and all that do wickedly, shall be..."

462
00:43:42,335 --> 00:43:43,586
Yes?

463
00:43:44,004 --> 00:43:46,923
I'm sorry, Parson.
I don't want to disturb the services.

464
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:49,342
You already have.

465
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:52,262
You don't come
to this church very often, Marshal.

466
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:55,724
And when you got married today,
you didn't see fit to be married here.

467
00:43:56,141 --> 00:43:58,768
What could be so important
to bring you here now?

468
00:43:59,644 --> 00:44:01,146
I need help.

469
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:08,528
It's true, I haven't been
a church-going man.

470
00:44:08,653 --> 00:44:10,447
And maybe that's a bad thing.

471
00:44:10,572 --> 00:44:14,033
And I didn't get married here today
because my wife's a Quaker.

472
00:44:14,784 --> 00:44:18,496
But I came here for help
because there are people here.

473
00:44:20,373 --> 00:44:21,833
I'm sorry, Marshal.

474
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:24,419
Say what you have to say.

475
00:44:26,212 --> 00:44:29,841
Maybe some of you already
know it, but if you don't,

476
00:44:29,966 --> 00:44:33,052
it looks like Frank Miller's
coming back on the noon train.

477
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:40,101
I need all the special deputies I can get.

478
00:44:45,356 --> 00:44:50,111
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go.

479
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:54,240
Hold it a minute. Hold it.

480
00:44:54,741 --> 00:44:57,702
Before we go rushing out into something
that ain't gonna be so pleasant,

481
00:44:57,827 --> 00:45:00,496
let's be sure we know
what this is all about.

482
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:03,291
What I want to know is this.

483
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:06,294
Ain't it true that Kane
ain't no longer marshal?

484
00:45:08,004 --> 00:45:11,299
And ain't it true there's personal
trouble between him and Miller?

485
00:45:16,262 --> 00:45:19,724
All right, all right. Quiet, everybody!

486
00:45:20,141 --> 00:45:23,061
If there's a difference of opinion,
let everybody have a say.

487
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:24,938
But let's do it like grown-up people.

488
00:45:25,063 --> 00:45:27,774
And let's get all the kids
out of the building.

489
00:46:00,473 --> 00:46:04,185
- Anything on the train?
- It's on time as far as I know, sir.

490
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:11,734
I say it don't really matter
if there's anything personal

491
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:13,736
between Miller and the marshal here.

492
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:16,447
We all know who Miller is
and what Miller is.

493
00:46:16,572 --> 00:46:18,741
What's more, we're wasting time.

494
00:46:19,284 --> 00:46:21,744
All right. Coy.

495
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:25,707
Yes, we all know who Miller is.
But we put him away once.

496
00:46:25,832 --> 00:46:29,335
And who saved him from hanging?
The politicians up north.

497
00:46:29,544 --> 00:46:32,505
I say this is their mess.
Let them take care of it.

498
00:46:33,172 --> 00:46:35,550
- Sawyer.
- Well, I say this.

499
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:39,012
We've been paying good money
right along for a marshal and deputies.

500
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:42,849
Now the first time there's any trouble,
we're supposed to take care of it ourselves.

501
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:45,268
Well, what have we been paying for
all this time?

502
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:48,396
I say we're not peace officers.
This ain't our job.

503
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:52,859
I've been saying right along,
we ought to have more deputies.

504
00:46:52,984 --> 00:46:55,945
If we did,
we wouldn't be facing this thing now.

505
00:46:56,612 --> 00:47:00,366
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Everybody, quiet!

506
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:03,578
Keep it orderly.
You had your hand up, Ezra.

507
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,165
I can't believe I've heard some
of the things that have been said here.

508
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,833
You all ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

509
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:12,670
Sure, we paid this man and he was
the best marshal this town ever had.

510
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:14,672
It ain't his trouble, it's ours.

511
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:18,092
I tell you, if we don't do what's right,
we're gonna have plenty more trouble.

512
00:47:18,217 --> 00:47:22,054
So there ain't but one thing to do now.
And you all know what that is.

513
00:47:22,263 --> 00:47:23,514
Go ahead, Kibbee.

514
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,349
This whole thing's been handled wrong.

515
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,603
Here's those three killers
walking the streets bold as brass.

516
00:47:28,728 --> 00:47:30,271
Why didn't you arrest them, Marshal?

517
00:47:30,396 --> 00:47:32,315
Why didn't you put them in jail
where they ought to be?

518
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,026
Then we'd only have Miller to worry
about instead of the four of them.

519
00:47:35,151 --> 00:47:37,779
I haven't anything to arrest them for,
Mr Trumbull.

520
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:39,405
They haven't done anything.

521
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,950
There's no law against them
sitting on a bench at the depot.

522
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:44,994
I can't listen to any more of this.

523
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,038
What's the matter with you people?

524
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:48,831
Don't you remember when a decent woman

525
00:47:48,956 --> 00:47:51,292
couldn't walk down the street
in broad daylight?

526
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:54,879
Don't you remember when this wasn't
a fit place to bring up a child?

527
00:47:55,004 --> 00:47:58,466
How can you sit here
and talk and talk and talk like this?

528
00:47:58,591 --> 00:48:00,802
What are we all getting so excited about?

529
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:03,596
How do we know
Miller's on that train, anyway?

530
00:48:03,888 --> 00:48:06,349
Well, we can be pretty sure he's on it.

531
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:08,518
Time's getting short.

532
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:12,813
Parson, you got anything to say?

533
00:48:12,939 --> 00:48:17,235
I don't know. The Commandments say,
"Thou shalt not kill."

534
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,904
But we hire men to go out
and do it for us.

535
00:48:20,279 --> 00:48:23,032
The right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here.

536
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:26,619
But if you're asking me to tell my people
to go out and kill

537
00:48:26,744 --> 00:48:28,788
and maybe get themselves killed,

538
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:33,292
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

539
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:36,837
All right. I'll say this,

540
00:48:36,963 --> 00:48:39,840
what this town owes Will Kane here,
it can never pay with money.

541
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:41,634
And don't ever forget it.

542
00:48:42,218 --> 00:48:45,972
He's the best marshal we ever had,
maybe the best marshal we'll ever have.

543
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:50,768
So if Miller comes back here today,
it's our problem, not his.

544
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:54,188
It's our problem
because this is our town.

545
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:56,691
We made it with our own hands
out of nothing.

546
00:48:56,816 --> 00:48:59,193
And if we want to keep it decent,
keep it growing,

547
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:01,279
we've got to think mighty clear
here today.

548
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:04,115
And we've got to have the courage
to do what we think is right,

549
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,285
no matter how hard it is. All right.

550
00:49:07,994 --> 00:49:11,080
There's gonna be fighting
when Kane and Miller meet.

551
00:49:11,205 --> 00:49:15,209
And somebody's going to get hurt,
that's for sure. Now,

552
00:49:15,835 --> 00:49:18,838
people up north
are thinking about this town.

553
00:49:18,963 --> 00:49:22,300
Thinking mighty hard, thinking about
sending money down here

554
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:24,885
to put up stores and to build factories.

555
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:28,431
It'll mean a lot to this town. An awful lot.

556
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:32,601
But if they're gonna read about
shooting and killing in the streets,

557
00:49:32,727 --> 00:49:34,729
what are they gonna think then?

558
00:49:34,895 --> 00:49:39,734
I'll tell you. They're gonna think
this is just another wide-open town,

559
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:42,945
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

560
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:47,700
In one day,
this town will be set back five years.

561
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:50,578
And I don't think we can let that happen.

562
00:49:50,828 --> 00:49:54,081
Mind you, you all know
how I feel about this man.

563
00:49:54,665 --> 00:49:57,084
He's a mighty brave man. A good man.

564
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,129
He didn't have to come back here today.

565
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:04,341
And for his sake and the sake
of this town, I wish he hadn't.

566
00:50:05,926 --> 00:50:08,262
Because if he's not here
when Miller comes,

567
00:50:08,387 --> 00:50:11,432
my hunch is there won't be any trouble.
Not one bit.

568
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:13,267
Tomorrow we'll have a new marshal,

569
00:50:13,392 --> 00:50:16,520
and if we can all agree here
to offer him our services,

570
00:50:16,729 --> 00:50:19,523
I think we can handle anything
that comes along.

571
00:50:20,316 --> 00:50:22,026
Now, to me, that makes sense.

572
00:50:22,693 --> 00:50:25,071
To me, that's the only way out of this.

573
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:30,659
Will, I think you better go
while there's still time.

574
00:50:32,495 --> 00:50:35,581
It's better for you, and it's better for us.

575
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:47,426
Thanks.

576
00:51:17,915 --> 00:51:20,501
Why don't you put that thing away?

577
00:51:35,516 --> 00:51:38,811
- Bang, bang, bang!
- Bang, bang, you're dead, Kane!

578
00:52:17,057 --> 00:52:21,186
- I sent a kid to find you. Didn't he come?
- He was here.

579
00:52:25,149 --> 00:52:28,235
You've been my friend all my life.
You got me this job.

580
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,279
You made them send for me.

581
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:34,408
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to be like you, Mart.

582
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:36,493
You've been a lawman all your life.

583
00:52:36,618 --> 00:52:39,038
Yeah, yeah, all my life.

584
00:52:39,163 --> 00:52:42,583
It's a great life.
You risk your skin catching killers,

585
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:46,712
and the juries turn them loose so they
can come back and shoot at you again.

586
00:52:46,837 --> 00:52:49,506
If you're honest,
you're poor your whole life.

587
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:53,802
And in the end, you wind up dying
all alone on some dirty street.

588
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:54,928
For what?

589
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,682
For nothing. For a tin star.

590
00:52:59,224 --> 00:53:01,393
Listen, the judge has left town,

591
00:53:01,518 --> 00:53:04,104
Harvey's quit,
and I'm having trouble getting deputies.

592
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:06,982
It figures. It's all happened too sudden.

593
00:53:07,524 --> 00:53:10,194
People got to talk themselves
into law and order

594
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,945
before they do anything about it.

595
00:53:12,071 --> 00:53:16,950
Maybe because down deep
they don't care. They just don't care.

596
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,084
What'll I do, Mart?

597
00:53:28,128 --> 00:53:30,506
I was hoping you wouldn't come back.

598
00:53:30,881 --> 00:53:32,382
You know why I came back.

599
00:53:32,508 --> 00:53:34,551
Well, not to commit suicide.

600
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:39,139
Sometimes...
Sometimes prison changes a man.

601
00:53:39,264 --> 00:53:43,727
Not him. This is all planned.
That's why they're all here.

602
00:53:44,436 --> 00:53:46,897
Get out, Will. Get out.

603
00:53:57,991 --> 00:54:00,202
Will you come down to that depot with me?

604
00:54:00,327 --> 00:54:01,411
No.

605
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:07,584
You know how I feel about you.
But I ain't going with you.

606
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:12,631
Seems like a man with busted knuckles
didn't need arthritis, too, don't it?

607
00:54:13,841 --> 00:54:17,344
No, I couldn't do nothing for you.
You'd be worried about me.

608
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:20,430
You'd get yourself killed
worrying about me.

609
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:23,100
It's too one-sided like it is.

610
00:54:29,356 --> 00:54:31,650
- So long, Mart.
- So long.

611
00:54:33,485 --> 00:54:38,198
It's all for nothing, Will.
It's all for nothing.

612
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:53,297
Excuse me,
what is Mrs Ramírez's room number?

613
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:56,550
- Three.
- Thank you.

614
00:55:13,734 --> 00:55:15,027
Come in.

615
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:22,242
- Yes?
- Mrs Ramírez? I'm Mrs Kane.

616
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:24,161
I know.

617
00:55:26,455 --> 00:55:28,999
- May I come in?
- If you like.

618
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:37,883
- Sit down, Mrs Kane.
- No, thank you.

619
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,344
- What do you want?
- Oh, please...

620
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:43,805
It's just that I'm afraid if I sat down,
I wouldn't be able to get up again.

621
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,850
- Why?
- It wasn't easy for me to come here.

622
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:48,143
Why?

623
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:52,397
Look, Mrs Ramírez,
Will and I were married an hour ago.

624
00:55:52,522 --> 00:55:54,649
We were all packed and ready to leave,

625
00:55:54,775 --> 00:55:57,277
and then this thing happened
and he wouldn't go.

626
00:55:57,402 --> 00:56:01,740
I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,
I just couldn't reach him.

627
00:56:02,616 --> 00:56:06,703
- And now?
- Well, that man downstairs, the clerk,

628
00:56:07,371 --> 00:56:09,498
he said things about you and Will.

629
00:56:10,332 --> 00:56:12,959
I've been trying to understand
why he wouldn't go with me,

630
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:16,671
and now all I can think of
is that it's got to be because of you.

631
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:18,382
What do you want from me?

632
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:21,802
Let him go. He still has a chance.
Let him go.

633
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:25,389
- I cannot help you.
- Please.

634
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:27,682
He isn't staying for me.

635
00:56:28,183 --> 00:56:31,186
I haven't spoken to him for a year
until today.

636
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:39,444
- I am leaving on the same train you are.
- Then what is it? Why is he staying?

637
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:44,074
If you don't know,
I cannot explain it to you.

638
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:49,913
Well, thank you, anyway.
You've been very kind.

639
00:56:51,748 --> 00:56:55,794
What kind of woman are you?
How can you leave him like this?

640
00:56:56,128 --> 00:56:59,047
Does the sound of guns
frighten you that much?

641
00:56:59,256 --> 00:57:01,925
No, Mrs Ramírez, I've heard guns.

642
00:57:02,592 --> 00:57:05,220
My father and my brother
were killed by guns.

643
00:57:05,804 --> 00:57:09,933
They were on the right side, but that didn't
help them any when the shooting started.

644
00:57:10,058 --> 00:57:13,436
My brother was 19. I watched him die.

645
00:57:14,646 --> 00:57:19,609
That's when I became a Quaker.
I don't care who's right or who's wrong.

646
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:23,363
There's got to be some better way
for people to live.

647
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:28,535
Will knows how I feel about it.

648
00:57:29,536 --> 00:57:33,248
Just a minute. Are you going
to wait for the train downstairs?

649
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:36,543
- Yes.
- Why don't you wait here?

650
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:56,479
Well, I got no use for Kane,
but I'll say this, he's got guts.

651
00:57:56,605 --> 00:57:59,065
You're mighty broad-minded, Joe.

652
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,405
Now, you, Harv,
I always figured you for guts,

653
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,908
but I never gave you any credit
for brains, till now.

654
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:09,701
What's that mean?

655
00:58:10,493 --> 00:58:14,414
Nothing. Only it takes a smart man
to know when to back away.

656
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:21,546
If I can't pick my company when I drink
in here, I ain't coming in here anymore.

657
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:25,508
Okay. All right.

658
00:58:25,634 --> 00:58:28,553
Look at the boy with the tin star.

659
00:58:28,678 --> 00:58:31,264
All right, if that's the way you want it.

660
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:37,145
All right, boys,
what are you going to have?

661
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:58,685
Put a saddle on him, Kane.
Go on, saddle him up.

662
00:59:59,227 --> 01:00:00,937
He'll go a long way before he tires.

663
01:00:01,062 --> 01:00:02,897
That's what you were thinking, wasn't it?

664
01:00:03,022 --> 01:00:04,941
- Kind of.
- You scared?

665
01:00:06,818 --> 01:00:08,027
I guess so.

666
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:12,365
Sure. It stands to reason.

667
01:00:15,285 --> 01:00:18,246
Come on, let me help you.

668
01:00:24,085 --> 01:00:27,964
Seems like all everybody and his brother
wants is to get me out of town.

669
01:00:28,089 --> 01:00:30,550
Well, nobody wants to see you get killed.

670
01:00:33,428 --> 01:00:34,596
Hold it. Where are you going?

671
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:36,222
I don't know. Back to the office, I guess.

672
01:00:36,347 --> 01:00:39,350
Oh, no. You're getting on that horse
and you're getting out.

673
01:00:39,475 --> 01:00:41,227
What's the matter with you?

674
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:44,022
You were ready to do it yourself.
You said so.

675
01:00:44,439 --> 01:00:45,648
Look, Harv.

676
01:00:45,773 --> 01:00:48,109
I thought about it because I was tired.

677
01:00:48,234 --> 01:00:50,612
You think about a lot of things
when you're tired.

678
01:00:50,737 --> 01:00:52,864
- But I can't do it.
- Why?

679
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:54,782
I don't know.

680
01:00:55,575 --> 01:00:57,243
Get on that horse, Will.

681
01:00:58,995 --> 01:01:01,956
Why is it so important to you?
You don't care if I live or die.

682
01:01:02,081 --> 01:01:03,374
Come on.

683
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,211
Don't shove me, Harv.
I'm tired of being shoved.

684
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:54,694
I hate this town. I always hated it.

685
01:02:56,112 --> 01:02:59,240
To be a Mexican woman
in a town like this.

686
01:02:59,657 --> 01:03:00,867
I understand.

687
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:04,996
You do? That's good.

688
01:03:05,121 --> 01:03:08,833
I don't understand you.
No matter what you say.

689
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:12,003
If Kane was my man,
I'd never leave him like this.

690
01:03:12,128 --> 01:03:14,088
I'd get a gun. I'd fight.

691
01:03:14,213 --> 01:03:15,381
Why don't you?

692
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:20,052
He is not my man. He's yours.

693
01:03:39,614 --> 01:03:42,241
You got some clean water I can use?

694
01:03:42,366 --> 01:03:45,870
Why, sure, Marshal.
Sure, sure. Sit down.

695
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:55,338
Run into some kind of trouble, Marshal?

696
01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:57,131
No, no trouble.

697
01:04:01,594 --> 01:04:04,972
- What are you building?
- Oh, just fixing things up out back.

698
01:04:05,097 --> 01:04:08,225
Now take it easy, Mr Kane.
Just settle back. That's it.

699
01:04:11,479 --> 01:04:13,898
- Fred, Fred, hold it a while, will you?
- Hold it?

700
01:04:14,023 --> 01:04:15,691
You just stop till I tell you to start again.

701
01:04:34,877 --> 01:04:37,129
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Marshal.

702
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:38,631
No charge...

703
01:04:38,756 --> 01:04:41,592
You can tell your man
he can go back to work now.

704
01:05:06,701 --> 01:05:07,702
Will!

705
01:05:07,827 --> 01:05:11,372
I guess I forgot about you, Herb.
I'm sure glad you're here.

706
01:05:11,497 --> 01:05:13,416
I couldn't figure out
what was keeping you.

707
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,960
- Time's getting pretty short.
- Sure is.

708
01:05:16,085 --> 01:05:19,380
When are the other boys gonna
get here? We got to make plans.

709
01:05:19,505 --> 01:05:22,216
The other boys?
There aren't any other boys, Herb.

710
01:05:22,341 --> 01:05:24,719
- It's just you and me.
- You're joking.

711
01:05:25,261 --> 01:05:27,304
No, I couldn't get anybody.

712
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:31,267
I don't believe it.
This town ain't that low.

713
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:33,269
I couldn't get anybody.

714
01:05:33,811 --> 01:05:36,480
- Then it's just you and me.
- I guess so.

715
01:05:36,605 --> 01:05:39,567
You and me against Miller
and all the rest of them?

716
01:05:40,401 --> 01:05:43,028
That's right. Do you want out, Herb?

717
01:05:43,362 --> 01:05:47,366
Well, it isn't that I want out, no.

718
01:05:48,075 --> 01:05:50,286
You see... Look, I'll tell you the truth.

719
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:53,831
- I didn't figure on anything like this, Will.
- Neither did I.

720
01:05:53,956 --> 01:05:55,458
I volunteered. You know I did.

721
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,376
You didn't have to come to me.
I was ready.

722
01:05:57,501 --> 01:06:00,754
Sure, I'm ready now.
But this is different, Will.

723
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,756
This ain't like
what you said it was gonna be.

724
01:06:02,882 --> 01:06:05,259
This is just plain committing suicide.
And for what?

725
01:06:05,384 --> 01:06:07,761
Why me? I'm no lawman.
I just live here.

726
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:11,390
I got nothing personal against nobody.
I got no stake in this.

727
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:13,809
I guess not.

728
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,520
There's a limit
how much you can ask a man.

729
01:06:16,645 --> 01:06:19,148
I got a wife and kids.
What about my kids?

730
01:06:20,232 --> 01:06:22,193
Go on home to your kids, Herb.

731
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:30,451
You get some of the other fellows, Will,
and I'll still go through with it.

732
01:06:30,576 --> 01:06:32,369
Go on home, Herb.

733
01:06:58,979 --> 01:07:00,648
What do you want?

734
01:07:00,773 --> 01:07:02,816
I found them, Marshal,
like you wanted me to.

735
01:07:02,942 --> 01:07:06,570
- All but Mr Henderson.
- I found him. Thanks.

736
01:07:06,695 --> 01:07:08,197
You're welcome.

737
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:13,494
Marshal, listen. Let me fight with you.
I ain't afraid.

738
01:07:14,495 --> 01:07:17,164
- No.
- Please let me, Marshal.

739
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:20,042
You're a kid. You're a baby.

740
01:07:20,251 --> 01:07:23,379
I'm 16. And I can handle a gun, too.
You ought to see me.

741
01:07:23,712 --> 01:07:25,923
You're 14.
And what do you want to lie for?

742
01:07:26,048 --> 01:07:29,218
Well, I'm big for my age.
Please, Marshal.

743
01:07:29,343 --> 01:07:31,887
Well, you're big for your age all right,
but, no.

744
01:07:32,012 --> 01:07:34,390
Go on. Get out of here. Go on.

745
01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:46,498
Hey, Charlie, you can go home now.

746
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:50,252
Thanks, Marshal.

747
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,591
I sure appreciate it. I certainly do.

748
01:11:03,181 --> 01:11:05,892
You don't happen to know
if the saloon's open, do you, Will?

749
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:08,395
- I said go home, Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

750
01:11:14,985 --> 01:11:17,362
- So long, Helen.
- Goodbye, Sam.

751
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:18,655
Take care.

752
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,836
- Hello, Frank.
- How are you, Frank?

753
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:59,506
- Everything ready?
- Sure. Just the way you want it, Frank.

754
01:12:59,631 --> 01:13:03,426
- Yeah, we got your gun over here.
- Let's get started, then.

755
01:15:28,071 --> 01:15:30,824
- Can't you wait?
- Just want to be ready.

756
01:16:23,209 --> 01:16:24,627
Miller.

757
01:20:04,055 --> 01:20:05,264
Go!

758
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:56,602
All right, Kane. Come on out.

759
01:22:56,769 --> 01:23:00,230
Come out, or your friend here
will get it the way Pierce did.

760
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:04,825
I'll come out. Let her go.

761
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,539
As soon as you walk through that door.
Come on. I'll hold my fire.
