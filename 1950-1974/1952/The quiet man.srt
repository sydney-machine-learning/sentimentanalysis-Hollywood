1
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:57,526
Well, then... Urrmm, now.

2
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,365
I'll begin at the beginnin'.

3
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:03,572
A fine, soft day in the spring it was

4
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:07,613
when the train pulled into Castletown,
three hours late as usual,

5
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:09,985
and himself got out.

6
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:14,094
He didn't have the look
of an American tourist at all about him,

7
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:18,313
not a camera on him and, what was worst,
not even a fishing-rod.

8
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,920
Castletown?

9
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:31,974
- Castletown?
- Could you tell me the way to Inisfree?

10
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:35,882
Inisfree? Aw, five miles and maybe a half more.

11
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:38,187
- Do you see that road over there?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:43,041
Don't take that one, it'll do you no good.
Now, the best road to Inisfree, and many...

13
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:47,951
Oh, Inisfree you want. Be savin' your breath,
let me direct the gentleman.

14
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,655
Happen to know the way to Knoghenor?

15
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:53,763
If you knew the way there,
would he be asking the way to Inisfree?

16
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:56,502
There's many knows Knoghenor
that doesn't know Inisfree.

17
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,976
If you'd take the time to study
your country's history, Mr Maloney...

18
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:04,084
- ... you'd be the first to admit it.
- Don't send the poor man there.

19
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:08,505
The fishing is finished there entirely.
Tell me, Yank, what is it that you're after?

20
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:12,312
- Is it trout or salmon?
- All I want is to get to Inisfree.

21
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:15,652
Ah, now you're talking sense.
The best fishing in the country.

22
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:19,360
- True.
- Trout as long as your arm.

23
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,170
And salmon! The last one I got,
I expected Jonah to pop out of his mouth.

24
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,042
Ah, Inisfree. I'd bring you there myself,

25
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:29,213
only I got to drive the train.

26
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:33,333
Hey, was I tellin' you about that trout
I got two summers before last?

27
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:36,206
- At Inisfree?
- Not at all!

28
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:38,477
At Ballygar, over the other end of the country.

29
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:43,320
My sister's third young one is living at Inisfree,

30
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,128
and she'd be only too happy
to show you the road.

31
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,369
- No, no, if she was here.
- It's Inisfree the man wants to go to.

32
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,912
- You see that signpost over there?
- What do you know...

33
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:13,225
Inisfree, this way.

34
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:41,861
I wonder, now, why a man would go to Inisfree.

35
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:10,064
- Six foot six?
- Four and a half.

36
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,251
- Cincinnati?
- No, Pittsburgh.

37
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,622
Pi.. Pitss...

38
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:54,109
Don't you remember, Seaneen, and how it was.

39
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:59,988
The road led up past the chapel,
and it wound, and it wound,

40
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:04,575
and there was the field where
Dan Tobin's bull chased you.

41
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:09,985
It was a lovely little house, Seaneen,
and the roses.!

42
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:15,965
Your father used to tease me about them,
but he was that proud of them, too.

43
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,277
That's nothin' but a wee humble cottage.

44
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,899
That little place across the brook,
that humble cottage. Who owns it now?

45
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,605
The widow Tillane. Not that she lives there.

46
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,009
- You think she'd sell it?
- I doubt it.

47
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,915
Don't bet on it 'cause I'm buyin' it.

48
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:56,569
Why... why would a Yankee from Pittsburgh
want to buy it?

49
00:06:56,803 --> 00:07:00,845
I'll tell you why, Michaleen Oge Flynn,
young small Michael Flynn,

50
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,417
who used to wipe my runny nose
when I was kid.

51
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:07,993
Because I'm Sean Thornton,
and I was born in that little cottage.

52
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,369
And I've come home, and home I'm gonna stay.

53
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,644
Does that answer your questions
once and for all, you nosy little man?

54
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:21,131
Seaneen Thornton... The...

55
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,669
And look at you now.

56
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,110
What do they feed you,
all you men who are in Pittsburgh?

57
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,389
Steel, and pig-iron furnaces so hot
a man forgets his fear of hell.

58
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,133
When you're hard enough,
tough enough... other things.

59
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:42,610
Other things, Michaleen.

60
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:04,865
Now then, here comes myself,
that's me there, walking.

61
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:11,623
That tall, saintly-looking man.
Peter Lonergan, parish priest.

62
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:15,397
Good day, Father. Sean, this is Father Lonergan.

63
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:20,441
Father, would you believe it?
This is Sean Thornton,

64
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:23,847
born right here in Inisfree, home from America.

65
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:26,988
- Hello, Father.
- Ah, yes.

66
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,793
I knew your people, Sean.

67
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:36,150
Your grandfather...
He died in Australia, in a penal colony.

68
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,791
And your father, he was a good man too.

69
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:43,532
Bad accident, that. And your mother?

70
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,705
She's dead. America, when I was twelve.

71
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,818
I'll remember her in the mass tomorrow.
You'll be there, seven o'clock.

72
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:54,922
- Sure, I will.
- Good.

73
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:58,240
Sean, I'd like to have a little word
with Michaleen here.

74
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:01,079
- Sure thing, Father.
- It'll only take a minute.

75
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,486
- It's a little matter...
- Take your time. I'll be up ahead.

76
00:10:07,671 --> 00:10:09,875
Sean!

77
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:21,877
Hey, is that real?. She couldn't be.

78
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,556
Uh, nonsense, man. It's only a mirage
brought on by your terrible thirst.

79
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:30,495
Come up, Napoleon.

80
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:28,146
Over here we pronounce it "Co-han".

81
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:39,714
Good morning.

82
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:06,146
None of that now.
It's a bold, sinful man you are, Sean Thornton.

83
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:09,965
Who told you to playing patty fingers
in the Holy Water?

84
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:12,369
- Just being polite, that's all.
- What is this?

85
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:15,542
Maybe you don't know
it's a privilege only for courting couples,

86
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:18,181
and then only when the banns have been read.

87
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:23,158
And Mary Kate Danaher
dippin' her fingers in as neat as you please.

88
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:27,801
- What did you say her name was?
- Mary Kate Danaher.

89
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:30,073
And don't be getting any notions in your head.

90
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:33,858
- Mary Kate...
- Forget it, Sean, forget it.

91
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:36,864
- Put it out of your mind.
- Why? What's the matter?

92
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:40,204
- She isn't married or anything?
- Married? That one?

93
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:43,711
Not likely. And her
with her freckles and her temper.

94
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:47,519
Oh, that red head of hers is no lie.

95
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:51,360
Still, a man might put up with that
but not with her lack of a fortune.

96
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:07,504
The wealthiest woman in Inisfree
was the widow Tillane.

97
00:14:07,705 --> 00:14:10,143
She had neither chick nor child, poor soul,

98
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:14,185
but she was well-respected
and good to the poor.

99
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,926
- So you were born there, is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:21,332
All Thorntons were born there,
seven generations.

101
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:25,017
I see. And what is your thought, Mr Thornton,

102
00:14:25,218 --> 00:14:29,293
are you planning to turn
White O' Mornin' into a national shrine?

103
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,867
Perhaps charge tuppence a visit
for a guided tour

104
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:38,345
through the cottage where the Thorntons
were born. Are you a man of such eminence?

105
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,282
No, not exactly.

106
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:46,394
My own family has been in Ireland since
the Normans came hundreds of years ago,

107
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:51,283
but we've seen no reason to establish
monuments or memorials...

108
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:55,624
Look, Mrs Tillane, I'm not talking about
memorials or monuments.

109
00:14:55,825 --> 00:15:00,802
Ever since I was a kid
living in a shack near the slag heaps,

110
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:05,144
my mother has told me about
Inisfree and White O' Mornin'.

111
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:09,620
Inisfree has become
another word for heaven to me.

112
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,541
When I quit the... When I decided to come here,
it was with one thought in mind.

113
00:15:14,774 --> 00:15:17,580
Inisfree is far from being a heaven, Mr Thornton.

114
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:21,555
Ma'am, Mr Red Will Danaher
wishes to be announced,

115
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,661
I mean, Squire Danaher.

116
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:26,833
Watch your muddy boots!

117
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:35,617
- Mrs Tillane.
- Mr Thornton, from America.

118
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,794
- Aw!
- Boo.

119
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:41,540
It's him I'm here about, Mrs Tillane.

120
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,313
Is it true?
- Is what true?

121
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:49,022
That behind me back, he's trying to steal
White O' Mornin' right from under me nose?

122
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:52,229
And what concern of yours is this, Will Danaher?

123
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:55,803
Concern? Concern enough.

124
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,210
Haven't I made you a fair offer
for that same piece of land?

125
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,897
- And mine, lying right next to yours?
- You may keep your offers.

126
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:09,141
- Oh, so it's true. You sold it!
- No, I have not.

127
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:17,425
Oh, I knew it was a dirty lie
the very minute I heard it!

128
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:20,164
Sure, I said to him,

129
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:24,339
"Paggy McFarland, I won't believe
that Sarah'd be selling White O' Mornin'."

130
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:28,425
Why, it would be like building a fence
between your land and mine.

131
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:34,270
"And for a stranger to move in", says I.
"What would she be doing that for?"

132
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,176
And us so close to an understanding,
you might say.

133
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:40,416
- So you told him all that?
- That I did.

134
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,157
Down at the pub, I suppose,
in front of all those big ears,

135
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:47,898
with pints in their fists
and pipes in their mouths.

136
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,372
You may have the land, Mr Thornton,
for 600 pounds.

137
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:54,623
- Done!
- No, you can't. 610!

138
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:57,729
As I remember, you said 700 pounds.

139
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,004
See here, little man... 710!

140
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:05,712
- How about an even thousand?
- A thousand and...

141
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:11,590
And... and I'll be saying good day to you,
Mrs Tillane, and all here but one.

142
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,764
And I've got you down in my book.

143
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,319
My dad remembers his dad well.

144
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,893
Mike Thornton.
He had shoulders on him like an ox.

145
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:30,140
I saw him meself this mornin'. A tall,
handsome man, as I was passin' that chapel.

146
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,185
If you'd pass the pub as fast as you pass
the chapel, you'd be better off, little squint.

147
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:58,108
Just look at them!
Eating me out of house and home.

148
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:02,249
Get back to the fields! There's work to be done.

149
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,022
Isn't it a bit early in the day
for the bottle... even for you?

150
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:19,162
Feeney, get your book out.

151
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,642
Set down the name, the one Sean Thornton.

152
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:30,252
Oh, look at me clean floor! You dirty little...

153
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:34,404
- Shut your gob.
- Aw, shut you, little man! Here.

154
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:37,945
Clean it up yourself,
or there will be no dinner tonight!

155
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:45,426
There now! Look now,
you mustn't mind himself this day.

156
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:49,167
That's all the work you're good for,
you little tattletail.

157
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:54,612
- Feeney, have you written the name I gave you?
- I have.

158
00:18:54,812 --> 00:19:00,401
Well, strike a line through it.
That's for him. Sean Thornton...

159
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,846
So... He bought White O' Mornin'
in spite of you.

160
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:12,794
Good for widow Tillane.

161
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:17,170
Pay no attention to her at all! Take no notice.

162
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,409
You do, and there'll be a fine wake
in this house tonight.

163
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:24,161
After all, he's got more right to that land
than you have!

164
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,989
He'll regret it to his dying day,
if ever he lives that long.

165
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:45,671
- Will it be all right if I leave my bags in here?
- I imagine they'll be safe enough.

166
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:51,829
If you see a little guy, Michaleen Flynn,
tell him I'm waiting for him in the bar.

167
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:56,137
- It'll be a pleasure, especially for Michaleen.
- Thanks.

168
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:58,643
Is there anything you should like now, Yank?

169
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:04,956
If I think of anything, I'll let you know.

170
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,757
Evening.

171
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,502
Pleasant night.

172
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:29,516
- I'll try one of those black beers.
- Oh, the porter. Yes, sir.

173
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:39,615
Sir, will you join me? Matter of fact,
I'd like to buy everybody a drink.

174
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:44,191
I do not believe I heard your name, tall man.

175
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:46,930
Thornton. Sean Thornton.

176
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,372
And... your father's name?

177
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:56,650
Mike. Michael Thornton.
He used to live here, by the Mornin'.

178
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,825
I just bought the place back.
That's why I'm here.

179
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:06,581
Then your grandfather
would be Ol' Sean Thornton.

180
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:10,389
- Right.
- Bless his memory.

181
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:12,961
So it's himself you're named after.

182
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:19,240
Well, now. That being the case, it is
a pleasant evening and we will have a drink.

183
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:26,455
* There was a wild colonial boy

184
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:30,641
#Jack Duggan was his name

185
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,586
# He was born and bred in Ireland

186
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:41,129
# In a town called Castlemaine

187
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:45,137
- Good evening, Father.
- Is the rest of the committee here?

188
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,075
- They're waiting.
- Sorry we're late.

189
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:52,386
- The fishing was bad, was it?
- Fine lot of time we had for that!

190
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:55,904
- Oh, Michaleen...
- Commandant Forbes.

191
00:21:56,105 --> 00:22:00,079
You can forget about the Commandant.
We're at peace now.

192
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,152
Sure, but I haven't given up hope.

193
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:08,028
- Your Yankee friend is waitin' in the bar.
- Oh, he's here already...

194
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:10,701
Wait a minute. Who is he anyway?

195
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:16,679
He's a nice, quiet, peacelovin' man
come home to Ireland to forget his troubles.

196
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:21,367
- Troubles?
- Yes, he's a millionaire like all the Yanks.

197
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,941
But he is eccentric. Wait till I show you.

198
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,721
- What is it?
- A bag to sleep in. A sleeper bag they call it.

199
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:36,665
I'm tellin' you. The sleeper bag...
Wait till I show you how it operates.

200
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,537
- Where does it open?
- Hurry up, I have an important appointment.

201
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:41,843
- Well, open it up!
- Here.

202
00:22:42,043 --> 00:22:46,597
# At the early age of sixteen years

203
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:50,872
# He left his native home

204
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:55,948
# And to Australia's sunny shores

205
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,558
# He was inclined to roam

206
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:05,301
# He robbed a wealthy squireen

207
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:10,022
# All arms he did destroy

208
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,731
# A terror to Australia was

209
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:19,741
# This wild colonial boy

210
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:27,324
Sean Thornton, the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home.

211
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:29,461
Thank you.

212
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:34,517
"And the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home. "

213
00:23:35,252 --> 00:23:38,758
- What's wrong with that little speech?
- Oh, you'd be knowin' what.

214
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:49,948
I'm a man from Inisfree, and the best man.

215
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,087
And I bid no welcome to a man fool enough

216
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:57,599
to pay 1000 pounds for a bit of land
that isn't worth 200!

217
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,412
True for you, squire.

218
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:05,858
Didn't I hear of someone
named Danaher bid 810?

219
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:13,741
Get your book out.
Put his name down: Dermot Fahy.

220
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:18,049
F- A-H-Y. No e's, Squireen Danaher.

221
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,953
If you were half the man you think you are,

222
00:24:20,153 --> 00:24:23,472
you wouldn't begrudge a Thornton
the right to his birthplace.

223
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:27,346
- What right has he to a land he's never worked?
- It's Thornton land, isn't it?

224
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,887
- You've too much of your own as it is.
- Quiet, if you please.

225
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:35,162
Parliamentary procedure.
Squire Danaher has the floor.

226
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:38,335
If I had the floor...

227
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:42,511
- ... I'd hit that big ape with it.
- Hold on.

228
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:45,784
I don't blame Mr Danaher for gettin' on his ear.

229
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:50,304
Who's on his ear? Why, you and ten like you
couldn't put a Danaher on his ear.

230
00:24:50,504 --> 00:24:53,510
- It's just a way of speaking...
- Mind your ways, then.

231
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:59,189
The point is, it's already done. I own
the property now, and since we're neighbours...

232
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,761
Neighbours? Neighbours...

233
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:04,467
Never!

234
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:09,076
And if I so much as catch you putting
one foot on my property, I... I...

235
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,529
And, oh, another thing.
You keep away from my sister Mary Kate.

236
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:15,834
She's not for the likes of you.

237
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:20,243
Where I come from, we don't talk
about our womenfolk in saloons.

238
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:23,550
You sort of make a habit of it.
This morning it was widow Tillane.

239
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,925
- What's that?
- That's true. It's ashamed you should be.

240
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:32,368
Hey, look, I'm not accusing Mary Kate.
It's him.

241
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:36,176
Why, this very moment,
let him deny it if he can.

242
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:39,728
At the back of the chapel,
he took liberties that he shouldn't have.

243
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:43,134
- I said "good morning" to her.
- Good morning?

244
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:46,441
- It was "good night" you had on your mind.
- That's a lie.

245
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,120
- That's a what?
- I said "that's a lie".

246
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:58,198
That's a word I take from no man!
Put up your fists.

247
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:00,771
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- But I'm gonna...

248
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:05,290
Thank you.

249
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:10,968
Danaher!
What's the matter with you?

250
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:14,142
He's drunk!
Feeney, take him home, will you.

251
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:16,981
Don't soil your knuckles on the man.

252
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:19,821
- Come on, what do you say?
- Never.

253
00:26:20,021 --> 00:26:22,660
Take the man's hand, or I'll read your name
on a mass on Sunday.

254
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:25,933
Take it.
- I'd join the Church of Ireland first.

255
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:30,520
As if they'd have you.
Shake his hand like I tell you.

256
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,860
Come on, come on.
- Shake hands?

257
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:46,218
It's a good grip you have.
I always hated a flappy handshake myself.

258
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:57,953
Father Paul!

259
00:26:58,188 --> 00:27:02,729
Michaleen, introduce me to this quiet,
peacelovin' man of yours.

260
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:06,304
I have a strange notion
we're going to be friends, Yank.

261
00:27:06,504 --> 00:27:10,145
Give me a minute.
Just let some blood run back into this.

262
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:17,059
Sean Thornton... His grandfather,
a grand man he was, was hung in Australia.

263
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,715
I could tell you blood-curdlin' stories about him,
but me throat...

264
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,554
All right, come on.

265
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,700
# He was born and bred in Ireland

266
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:36,443
# In a town called Castlemaine

267
00:27:36,644 --> 00:27:41,587
# He was his father's only son

268
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:46,441
# His mother's pride and joy

269
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:51,586
# And dearly did his parents love

270
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:54,692
# This wild colonial boy

271
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:50,461
Are you sure you won't change your mind,
and come around home with me?

272
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:54,402
Don't worry about it.
I've got my sleeping bag, haven't I.

273
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:58,388
Well, it's a nice, soft night.

274
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:03,298
So, I think I'lljoin my comrades,
and talk a little treason.

275
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,672
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Michaleen.

276
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,609
God bless you.

277
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:12,518
So bold one you are.
Who gave you leave to be kissin' me?

278
00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:16,158
- So you can talk?
- Yes, I can, I will, and I do.

279
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,930
It's more than talk you'll be gettin'
if you step closer.

280
00:31:19,131 --> 00:31:22,671
- Don't worry. You've got a wallop.
- You'll get over it, I'm thinkin'.

281
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:27,047
Some things a man doesn't get over so easily.

282
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:29,864
Like what supposin'?

283
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:35,309
Like the sight of a girl coming through the fields,
with the sun on her hair.

284
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:41,487
- Kneeling in church, with a face like a saint.
- Saint, indeed.

285
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:45,529
And now, coming to a man's house
to clean it for him.

286
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:49,036
But... that was just my way
of bein' a good Christian act.

287
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:53,287
I know it was, Mary Kate Danaher,
and it was nice of you.

288
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,034
Not at all.

289
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:16,192
- Hello.
- Good morning, Mr Thornton.

290
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:19,566
- How are you, Fa.. Doctor...
- No, no. Mr.

291
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:23,507
And on formal occasions,
the Reverend Mr Playfair.

292
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:25,444
And this is Mrs Playfair.

293
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:30,154
Well, Mr Thornton.
You are a wonder.

294
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:36,511
It looks the way all the Irish cottages
should... and so seldom do.

295
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:41,287
And only an American
would have thought of emerald green.

296
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:46,665
- Red is more durable.
- And the roses! How nice.

297
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:52,811
You'll need lots of horse manure.
Fertiliser, I mean. Horse is the best.

298
00:33:53,012 --> 00:33:59,268
Oh, I brought you a plant.
You know, "a primrose by a river's brink".

299
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:03,711
"Brim", not "brink".
The next line ends in "hymn".

300
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:08,554
Poets are so silly, aren't they?
Oh, I hope you're not one, Mr Thornton.

301
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:11,927
- Oh no, ma'am, I...
- Thornton.

302
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:15,268
There's a familiar ring to it.

303
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,180
Ring to it... Thornton...

304
00:34:22,415 --> 00:34:26,101
It's a common name.
Thank you for the plant, Mrs Playfair,

305
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:29,708
this is damn... darn... awfully nice of you.

306
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:32,915
Oh?

307
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:51,196
It's a bed. Excuse me.

308
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:57,943
- Morning.
That's a fine big bed, Mr Thornton.

309
00:34:58,144 --> 00:35:00,782
Biggest one I could find.

310
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:18,430
Is that a bed or a parade ground?

311
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,672
Oh, a man'd have to be a sprinter
to catch his wife in a bed like that.

312
00:35:38,212 --> 00:35:40,051
Whoa!

313
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:03,844
Mr Flynn... And what are you
all dressed up for, Michaleen Oge?

314
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:09,122
I ha...

315
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:18,375
- I have come...
- Oh, I can see that.

316
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:22,115
- But from whose pub was it?
- P... pub?

317
00:36:23,218 --> 00:36:28,371
You've a tongue like an adder.
I go about me own business,

318
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:32,915
and tell Thorn Seanton
he's well off without you.

319
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:36,690
Wait a minute. What was that?

320
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:42,167
Well, if you listened
and not be interruptin' the matchmaker.

321
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:48,915
I have come...

322
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:53,969
- ... at the request of Thorn Seanton...
- Sean Thornton.

323
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,840
Shut up.

324
00:36:56,909 --> 00:37:01,518
...bachelor, and party of the first part...

325
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:10,370
...to ask of you, strictly and formally, here...

326
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:15,446
...Mary Kate Danaher, spinster...

327
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:18,664
...and party to the second part...

328
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:25,912
Well?. Go on, you were sayin'?

329
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:32,426
Me mouth is like a dry crust,
and the sun is that hot, and me pate...

330
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,131
Would you be steppin' into the parlour?

331
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:40,943
The house may belong to my brother,
but what's in the parlour belongs to me.

332
00:37:41,143 --> 00:37:46,532
I will then, and I hope there's a bottle there,
whoever it belongs to.

333
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,536
It could be.

334
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:00,795
You have a fine, steady hand.

335
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:17,640
To good bargaining.

336
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,222
To resume:

337
00:38:25,455 --> 00:38:27,594
- The party of the first part...
- That's him.

338
00:38:27,794 --> 00:38:34,118
...has instructed me to enquire
before enterin' into formal negotiations...

339
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:37,525
- ... whether the party to the second part...
- That's me.

340
00:38:37,725 --> 00:38:44,172
...thinks kindly of the general idea,
or in his own words... American, eh...

341
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,215
- ... eh, yes, he wants to know if you go for it.
- Go for it?

342
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:54,426
- And if you do, he'll speak to your brother.
- That won't be easy.

343
00:38:54,627 --> 00:38:56,664
Oh, as well I know it.

344
00:38:56,864 --> 00:39:01,986
He'd as soon put his fist into my teeth
as bid me the time of the day.

345
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:07,898
What did Sean... the party of the first part,
say about my fortune?

346
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:10,771
He says he doesn't give it...

347
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:15,747
He says it's a matter of
complete indifference to him.

348
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:20,257
- He did?
- He says he doesn't give a sh...

349
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:26,748
He says it's all one to him if you come
in the clothes on your back, or without them.

350
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:34,530
Oh, he did, did he? Well.

351
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:39,540
A fine opinion he must have of me, if he thinks
I'd go to any man without a proper fortune.

352
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:43,015
And this you may tell
your Mr Party of the first part:

353
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:47,692
When I wed, whatever's my own, goes with me.

354
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,505
Get up, little man.

355
00:39:57,922 --> 00:39:59,893
And all this furniture is mine.

356
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:04,069
And I have that china, and linen,
and 50 pounds in gold my father left me,

357
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:09,612
and my mother's rings, brooches,
my grandmother's veil, her silver comb...

358
00:40:10,381 --> 00:40:17,072
Thirty pounds odd in notes and silver
I've earned these past 15 years, that's all.

359
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:24,053
You're a well propertied woman.
I wouldn't mind marryin' you meself.

360
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:30,400
Eh, where'd you leave the bottle?

361
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,961
And I'd have you tell him, that I'm no pauper
to be going to him in my shift.

362
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:55,930
# Lo, young May moon is beamin' love

363
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:01,675
# The glow of one's lamp is gleamin' love

364
00:41:01,908 --> 00:41:07,831
# How sweet to row through Mourner's Grove

365
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:15,647
# While the drowsy world is dreamin'...

366
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,587
- You know "The Peter And The Ghost".?
- I do not.

367
00:41:18,788 --> 00:41:23,397
- Neither do I.
- Could you use a little water in your whiskey?

368
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:29,854
When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey,
and when I drink water, I drink water.

369
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:32,893
Back to business now.

370
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:37,636
What answer will I give Sean Thornton,
Mary Kate Danaher?

371
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,311
Well, you can tell him from me that...

372
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:47,557
...that I go for it.

373
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:53,411
# Here's to steal a few hours from the night

374
00:41:54,149 --> 00:41:57,956
# My dear

375
00:42:12,386 --> 00:42:15,058
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

376
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,418
- Hey, what do I say?
- I'll do all the talkin'.

377
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:44,039
- And I'm suppose to stand here like a dummy?
- Shh, now.

378
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:54,961
- Will, there's someone coming to call.
- Who?

379
00:42:55,162 --> 00:42:57,400
It's... well...

380
00:42:57,633 --> 00:43:01,842
It's Michaleen Oge Flynn,
and there's a gentleman with him.

381
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,119
Here, Will, put on your coat.

382
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:11,473
Will Danaher, they're comin' to the front door.

383
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,813
Since when has the back door
been not good enough?

384
00:43:23,965 --> 00:43:26,637
God bless all in this house.
Good evening.

385
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:30,044
Miss Danaher,
we'd like a word with your brother.

386
00:43:31,714 --> 00:43:34,831
Come on in so, and welcome.

387
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,306
Easy now!

388
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:50,764
Mr Sean Thornton, bachelor,
meet Miss Mary Kate Danaher, spinster.

389
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:58,050
Miss Danaher, meet Mr Thornton
from Pittsburgh, Massachusetts, USA.

390
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:01,597
- Good evening, Miss Danaher.
- This...

391
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:05,538
This way, please.

392
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,797
- Eh, this is my brother...
- Leave the room.

393
00:44:17,997 --> 00:44:21,137
- But...
- I said, leave the room.

394
00:44:21,338 --> 00:44:25,590
- Yes, Will.
- Sit down, that's what chairs are for.

395
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:31,402
- If you've come for supper, you're late.
- Gracious invitation, but thank you, no.

396
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,878
I don't suppose there's a drop in the house.

397
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,155
- Help yourself to the buttermilk.
- Buttermilk? The Borgias would do better.

398
00:44:41,357 --> 00:44:47,302
We'll come with your permission
to the object of this visit.

399
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:54,327
You've noticed, I presume,
that I'm wearin' my official black coat.

400
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:57,868
I have. For your dead friend here.

401
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,475
I need no trouble
to arrange any marriages for me.

402
00:45:01,675 --> 00:45:07,687
I see. You've been making fine progress
with widow Tillane in the last ten years.

403
00:45:07,888 --> 00:45:10,260
- Is that what you've come to talk about?
- I have not.

404
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:14,179
- I've come to talk about your sister and him.
- Aw, get out.

405
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:18,087
If he was the last man
on the face of the earth, I'd still say no.

406
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:22,061
- Now just a minute.
- If it's a question of the girl's fortune...

407
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,537
Why, if it'd be a shilling piece
he wanted with her...

408
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:30,178
- ... I'd still say no.
- Come on, Michaleen. I told you so.

409
00:45:30,378 --> 00:45:33,953
- I'll explain it to her myself.
- Hey, Yank, I'll count three.

410
00:45:34,153 --> 00:45:37,259
If you're not out of the house by then,
I'll loose the dogs on you.

411
00:45:37,459 --> 00:45:42,848
If you say three,
you'll never hear the man count ten.

412
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:00,417
- Oh, Mary Kate, we tried.
- We'll see him again some other time.

413
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:08,144
I thank you anyway,
Sean Thornton, for the asking.

414
00:46:08,378 --> 00:46:13,488
You don't think this changes anything?
It's what you say that counts, not him.

415
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:16,061
Now, now, Sean.
You've gone too far, that's enough.

416
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:20,871
Say, what is this?
We're gonna get married, aren't we?

417
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:34,943
- I don't get it.
- This is Ireland, Sean, not America.

418
00:46:35,177 --> 00:46:41,323
Without her brother's consent she couldn't,
and wouldn't. I'm sorry for both of you.

419
00:47:14,936 --> 00:47:21,060
Those were the bad days. Sean with a face
as dark as the black hunter he rode.

420
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,531
A fine, ill-tempered pair they were.

421
00:47:23,765 --> 00:47:26,470
It was only a matter of time
before one or the other broke his neck.

422
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:28,976
We knew things couldn't go on this way.

423
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:39,197
Easy, Sean!

424
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:53,036
Hello, Mary Kate... Danaher.

425
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:57,445
Good morning, Sean Thornton.

426
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:08,643
So, we formed a little conspiracy.

427
00:48:08,846 --> 00:48:15,527
The Reverend Mr and Mrs Playfair,
Michaleen Oge and, saints forgive us, myself.

428
00:48:16,428 --> 00:48:21,872
And on the day of the Inisfree Races,
we sprung the trap on Red Will Danaher.

429
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:01,810
Remember, you make your speed
when you hit the water.

430
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,250
- Yes, father.
- And ride carefully, my son.

431
00:49:05,451 --> 00:49:06,853
Yes, mum.

432
00:49:07,053 --> 00:49:09,058
Thornton, no silks.

433
00:49:09,258 --> 00:49:11,729
- Your colours, Thornton.
- Thank you.

434
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:34,287
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

435
00:49:42,303 --> 00:49:47,281
Ladies, gentlemen, your attention, please!

436
00:49:47,515 --> 00:49:50,598
Will all the lovely ladies,

437
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:55,474
who are putting up their bonnets
for the Inisfree Cup,

438
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:59,917
please place their bonnets on the finishing line.

439
00:50:00,418 --> 00:50:03,959
Ladies, your bonnets, please!

440
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,735
- Will you not be putting up your bonnet?
- Indeed, I will not.

441
00:50:08,935 --> 00:50:11,173
- No?
- No!

442
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:24,077
Okay, Michaleen, the widow's bonnet.

443
00:50:24,278 --> 00:50:30,591
Will all the gentlemen riders
please go to the starting line.

444
00:50:31,293 --> 00:50:33,931
All riders, please.

445
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:40,589
Crown at 20 to 1 on the Yank.
I'm given 20 to 1 on the Yank...

446
00:50:41,757 --> 00:50:47,035
- I'm given 30 to 1... 40 to 1 on Danaher.
- Flynn!

447
00:50:48,238 --> 00:50:53,616
If you've done any matchmaking between
Thornton and my widow, I'll put you in me pocket.

448
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:59,394
- Ah, so you've heard?
- Father, what sort of a scoundrel is this Yank?

449
00:50:59,594 --> 00:51:02,601
One minute it's me sister,
and the next it's herself.

450
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:04,783
Well, blame no one but yourself.

451
00:51:04,983 --> 00:51:09,325
If you'd saved me as your matchmaker,
you would've been married long since.

452
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:13,467
- True, Will, true.
- I'm not saying it's too late yet.

453
00:51:13,668 --> 00:51:19,279
- What do you mean?
- Why has the widow stood you up so long?

454
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,750
- You're a fine looking man.
- I am.

455
00:51:21,952 --> 00:51:25,391
- A rich, propertied man.
- And well she knows it.

456
00:51:25,591 --> 00:51:29,845
- Father, will I tell him?
- Go ahead, Michaleen.

457
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:33,619
What woman would come into a house
with another woman in it?

458
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,429
If you got rid of Mary Kate,
the widow would be in like a shot.

459
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:42,738
- No.
- Yes. You had your chance and you flubbed it.

460
00:51:42,938 --> 00:51:46,579
You refused Seaneen Thornton,
and he reneged on you.

461
00:51:46,779 --> 00:51:52,593
Now, I doubt if he'd take your sister
if you put 1000 pounds on her.

462
00:51:52,794 --> 00:51:57,211
- Father Lonergan?
- I can't say it's true, and I won't say it's not.

463
00:51:57,413 --> 00:52:01,086
- But there's been talk.
- Oh, a lot of talk.

464
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:03,191
A lot of talk, eh?

465
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:06,965
Two women in the house,
and one of them a redhead.

466
00:52:08,969 --> 00:52:11,742
Two women.

467
00:52:17,621 --> 00:52:21,339
Three Our Fathers, and three Hail Marys.

468
00:52:27,618 --> 00:52:31,126
Morning, Mary Kate. Morning, children.

469
00:52:49,908 --> 00:52:52,547
Don't sit there gawking.
You're gonna put up your bonnet.

470
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,819
- I will do no such shameless thing.
- You will.

471
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:57,691
I will not!

472
00:53:23,053 --> 00:53:26,361
No bonnet, Mary Kate? What a pity.

473
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:59,583
Betting will now stop,

474
00:53:59,784 --> 00:54:05,228
and the sale of all intoxicating
and alcoholic drinks will cease. I mean it now!

475
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,447
Oh, Sergeant Major, in your good time, please.

476
00:54:31,627 --> 00:54:33,764
The Yank's holdin' back.

477
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:26,862
Foul!

478
00:55:45,644 --> 00:55:52,324
- Look at that crazy Danaher!
- Wouldn't it be wonderful if he broke his neck?

479
00:55:53,528 --> 00:55:56,366
Maybe he will now, God willing.

480
00:56:12,377 --> 00:56:15,049
Will... Will, come on!

481
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:31,527
- Foul.
- I didn't see it!

482
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:46,357
Come on, Sean! Sean... I mean Paul, Father Paul.

483
00:57:10,351 --> 00:57:13,390
- Thornton!
- He took your bonnet, Sarah.

484
00:57:39,087 --> 00:57:42,293
Fine race! You rode like a trooper.

485
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:47,516
Trooper... Trooper Thorn, of course!
I knew I'd seen you somewhere before.

486
00:57:47,749 --> 00:57:51,924
Now that you know,
I wish you'd keep it under your hat. Forget it.

487
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:56,100
- I understand. It'll be our secret.
- Thanks.

488
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,086
Your bonnet, Mrs Tillane.

489
00:58:06,287 --> 00:58:09,203
- A cup for the winner.
- Oh, thank you.

490
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:28,409
- Flynn... Does your offer still stand?
- Well, eh, that depends.

491
00:58:29,412 --> 00:58:35,602
- You... eh, you mentioned... 500 pounds.
- 350, and not another penny.

492
00:58:35,802 --> 00:58:40,612
Well, I speak to me
principal of the first part, eh?

493
00:59:08,815 --> 00:59:11,386
Good morning, good morning. Come on.

494
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:26,929
Well, now. The banns having been read...

495
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:30,302
...and no man objecting...

496
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:36,314
...I'm permitting this man to court me sister.

497
00:59:42,494 --> 00:59:45,067
But under the usual conditions.

498
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,423
Mr Flynn?

499
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:56,968
- Do you assume the full responsibility?
- I do, I do.

500
00:59:57,202 --> 01:00:02,078
And from now on, they'll do the walkin'
and the talkin' under me own eyes.

501
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:05,152
Well, then. Let the courting commence.

502
01:00:06,888 --> 01:00:12,534
None of that! Hands to yourself,
and your own side of the road.

503
01:00:12,736 --> 01:00:15,684
- Get onto the other side of the cart.
- Up you go.

504
01:01:07,144 --> 01:01:09,483
) Why do we have to have you along?

505
01:01:09,683 --> 01:01:13,524
Back in the States I'd honk the horn
and the gal'd come-a-runnin'...

506
01:01:13,724 --> 01:01:17,700
Come-a-runnin'? I'm no woman
to be honked at, and come-a-runnin'.

507
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:22,042
America... Pro-hi-bi-tion.

508
01:01:28,495 --> 01:01:30,136
Do you see that over there?

509
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:35,413
That's the ancestral home of the ancient Flynns.

510
01:01:35,614 --> 01:01:38,453
It was taken from us by... by... by the Druids.

511
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:57,002
You're the quietest couple I've ever herded.
We'll get nowhere by this rate.

512
01:01:58,071 --> 01:02:01,077
Off you get. I'll let you do a healthy mile or so,

513
01:02:01,277 --> 01:02:04,483
just to get you two walking correctly together.

514
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:13,903
Now, she's a fine, healthy girl.
No patty fingers, if you please.

515
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:56,446
- Nice day.
- It is that, Mr Thornton.

516
01:02:56,646 --> 01:03:00,153
- That's a pretty bonnet you have on.
- Bonnet?

517
01:03:00,354 --> 01:03:03,995
Don't you talk to me about bonnets!
After leaving mine stuck up...

518
01:03:04,195 --> 01:03:09,851
Easy now, easy now.
Is this a courting or a fight?

519
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:14,661
Have the manners not to hit a man until
he's your husband, and until he'll hit you back.

520
01:03:20,706 --> 01:03:25,516
I am sorry. I have a fearful temper.

521
01:03:26,919 --> 01:03:31,127
You might as well know about it now,
instead of finding out about it later.

522
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:34,278
We Danahers are a fighting people.

523
01:03:34,512 --> 01:03:40,090
I can think of a lot of things I'd rather do
to one of them... Miss Danaher.

524
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:45,434
Shh, Mr Thornton.
What will Mr Flynn be thinkin'?

525
01:04:12,066 --> 01:04:14,371
Can you ride a bike?

526
01:04:14,939 --> 01:04:17,478
Well, what are we waiting for?

527
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:23,966
Mary Kate Danaher! Sean!

528
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:29,613
Eh... ep... Come on!

529
01:04:30,782 --> 01:04:34,824
Come back here!
Come back at once!

530
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:45,011
Come back here!
Come back at once!

531
01:04:45,212 --> 01:04:47,920
Come back here! Come back!

532
01:04:56,814 --> 01:05:01,322
I think you have more sense than I have myself.

533
01:05:03,828 --> 01:05:06,333
Whoa there, Freddy.

534
01:07:21,508 --> 01:07:28,355
If anybody had told me six months ago,
that today I'd be in a graveyard in Inisfree

535
01:07:28,556 --> 01:07:31,395
with a girl like you that I'm just about to kiss...

536
01:07:32,565 --> 01:07:34,702
- The kiss is a long way off yet! - Ha?

537
01:07:34,936 --> 01:07:38,042
We just started the courting and
next month we'll walk together,

538
01:07:38,242 --> 01:07:40,614
and the month after that there'll be the trashing party...

539
01:07:40,814 --> 01:07:42,754
No.

540
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:47,840
- Maybe we won't have to wait that month... - Yup.

541
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:51,982
- ... or for the trashing party... - No.

542
01:07:54,086 --> 01:07:57,292
- ... or for the walking out together. - No.

543
01:07:58,862 --> 01:08:04,274
And so much the worse for you, Sean Thornton,
for I feel the same way about it myself.

544
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:14,171
And so they were married in the same chapel
I gave them their baptism.

545
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:17,812
Later, there was a nice, quiet little celebration.

546
01:10:21,788 --> 01:10:26,396
# Oh, as I went out one mornin: It being the month of May

547
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:30,304
# A farmer and his daughter abide their bonny way

548
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:34,179
# And the girl had only come in to the milking of her cow

549
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:38,258
# Sayin'I will an'I must get married, The humour is on me now

550
01:10:38,461 --> 01:10:42,240
# Oh, the humour is on me now, Oh, the humour is on me now

551
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,981
# Sayin'I will an'I must get married, The humour is on me now

552
01:10:47,384 --> 01:10:52,795
# So, at last the daughter married, she married well-to-do

553
01:10:52,995 --> 01:10:57,003
# And loved her darlin'husband a month, a year, or two

554
01:10:57,204 --> 01:11:00,878
# But he was all a tyrant as he quickly rode about

555
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:04,964
# Sayin'I'm sorry I ever married, The humour is on me now

556
01:11:05,165 --> 01:11:09,039
# Oh, humour is on me now, Oh, humour is on me now

557
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:13,949
# Sayin'I'm sorry I ever got married, The humour is on me now

558
01:11:18,124 --> 01:11:21,465
To a successful conspiracy.

559
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:36,440
- A toast, to the bride and groom! - One moment.

560
01:11:36,907 --> 01:11:41,048
There will be no toasts until we've seen the bride's fortune.

561
01:11:42,685 --> 01:11:46,193
The bride's fortune? You'll see it, never fear.

562
01:11:46,393 --> 01:11:51,805
We'll see it now, if you please.
The proprieties must be observed.

563
01:11:53,043 --> 01:11:55,890
- Father Lanergan. - Feeney.

564
01:12:01,335 --> 01:12:03,973
350 pounds gold.

565
01:12:05,008 --> 01:12:10,353
A collection of furnishings, linen,
and pewter goes with the sister...

566
01:12:10,553 --> 01:12:13,526
...of Will Danaher.

567
01:12:17,503 --> 01:12:19,783
Then, a toast.

568
01:12:20,485 --> 01:12:24,360
May their days be long, and full of happiness.

569
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,735
May their children be many, and full of health.

570
01:12:28,935 --> 01:12:33,378
And may they live in peace, and freedom.

571
01:12:41,294 --> 01:12:46,182
Reverend Fathers, ladies and gentlemen. Attention, please.

572
01:12:46,382 --> 01:12:51,860
Squire Danaher has the floor. In other words,
he's got somethin' to say to you all.

573
01:12:52,061 --> 01:12:56,302
Thank you. I have a little announcement to make.

574
01:12:56,636 --> 01:13:00,043
Fill up the glasses. All of them.

575
01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:21,899
Eh, today, I've given my sister in marriage.

576
01:13:23,335 --> 01:13:29,748
My only sister, and now she's gone from the house of Danaher.

577
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:34,335
- But what's in a house without a woman? - That's true.

578
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:36,607
That's right, what's a house without a woman in it?

579
01:13:36,807 --> 01:13:39,679
Yeah, what's a house without a woman in it?

580
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,855
Where would any man of us be without a woman?

581
01:13:44,055 --> 01:13:48,163
- Even Father Lonergan had a mother. - What do you expect?

582
01:13:48,365 --> 01:13:52,239
Yeah, what do you expect. What do you expect...

583
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:55,812
So... So...

584
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,768
- So, without further eloquence...
- Without further eloquence...

585
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:06,880
So, without further eloquence,
I will give you a toast to myself...

586
01:14:08,316 --> 01:14:11,055
...who is soon to be wed.

587
01:14:18,337 --> 01:14:21,309
All she has to do is to say that little word.

588
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:25,061
When's the happy day, Sarah darlin'?

589
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:28,802
Have you lost the little sense you were born with?

590
01:14:29,036 --> 01:14:33,379
- What's the matter, Sarah darlin'?
- And don't "darlin"' me.

591
01:14:33,579 --> 01:14:37,553
Who gave you the right to make such an announcement?

592
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:45,971
But Sarah... They all said...

593
01:14:47,106 --> 01:14:52,429
Why... The Reverend Mr Playfair,
Mrs Reverend, Father Lonergan.

594
01:14:52,629 --> 01:14:55,835
...eh, little Flynn... Michaleen.

595
01:14:57,137 --> 01:14:59,609
- Didn't you tell me...
- Oh, I didn't, I didn't.

596
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:03,284
Oh, you lied, didn't ya? You lied, didn't ya?

597
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:10,566
You all lied! It's bad enough for you people,
but my own priest.

598
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:21,766
You got her by fraud and falsity. You put them up to this.

599
01:15:21,966 --> 01:15:25,273
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Will, for heaven's sake.

600
01:15:25,473 --> 01:15:28,613
- Danaher, you're crazy! - Crazy, am I?

601
01:15:29,581 --> 01:15:32,387
This is something you won't get, now or never!

602
01:15:34,057 --> 01:15:36,295
Now, get out of here. All of you!

603
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:40,882
The Reverend first, ladies and gentlemen, get out!

604
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:43,254
Get out! - Come on, let's go home.

605
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:47,563
No, not without my fortune.
It's mine, and my mother's before me...

606
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:14,640
Steady, Trooper, steady.

607
01:17:31,586 --> 01:17:33,724
Let's go home.

608
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:58,920
Ever since I was a little girl,
I've dreamed of havin' my own things about me.

609
01:18:00,323 --> 01:18:04,999
My spinet... over there,

610
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:11,089
and the table here, and... my own chairs to rest upon.

611
01:18:12,124 --> 01:18:13,494
And...

612
01:18:17,369 --> 01:18:20,341
And the dresser over there in that corner.

613
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:26,721
And... my own china and pewter shinin' about me.

614
01:18:30,028 --> 01:18:32,032
And now...

615
01:18:33,037 --> 01:18:36,585
I didn't know you felt that way about it but...

616
01:18:36,819 --> 01:18:41,328
...seems like a lot of fuss and grief
over little furniture and stuff.

617
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:08,595
It is a pretty cottage, isn't it?
- Yeah.

618
01:19:10,232 --> 01:19:12,436
I think so.

619
01:19:13,104 --> 01:19:17,647
- Don't touch me. You have no right.
- What do you mean no right?

620
01:19:19,351 --> 01:19:23,833
I'll wear your ring,
I'll cook, and I'll wash.

621
01:19:24,035 --> 01:19:27,311
I'll keep the land, but that is all!

622
01:19:27,511 --> 01:19:31,386
Until I've got my dowry safe about me,
I'm no married woman.

623
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:35,929
I'm the servant I've always been,
without anything of my own.

624
01:19:36,129 --> 01:19:39,102
That's ridiculous! You're my wife, and fortune...

625
01:19:41,307 --> 01:19:44,413
- What is this?
- Haven't I been trying to tell you?

626
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:49,433
Not until you have my dowry, you haven't got any bit of me.
Me, myself!

627
01:19:49,634 --> 01:19:53,943
I'd still be dreaming amongst the things that aren't my own...

628
01:19:54,144 --> 01:19:56,314
...as if I had never met you.

629
01:19:58,152 --> 01:20:03,930
There's 300 years of happy dreamin
in those things of mine, and...

630
01:20:04,732 --> 01:20:10,377
...I want them. I want my dream.
I'll have it and I know it!

631
01:20:12,014 --> 01:20:16,200
- I'll say no other word to you. - All right.

632
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:21,878
You'll have your dowry, or daughter of fortune,
or whatever you call it.

633
01:20:22,078 --> 01:20:24,283
Well, get it then.

634
01:20:55,090 --> 01:21:01,436
There will be no locks or bolts between us,
except those in your own mercenary little heart.

635
01:21:59,054 --> 01:22:01,292
- Sean. - How'd you sleep?

636
01:22:02,762 --> 01:22:06,002
Don't be shamin' me, please, in front of your friends.

637
01:22:06,202 --> 01:22:09,843
What...? Oh, okay.

638
01:22:13,317 --> 01:22:16,990
There that I learned all me courtin'

639
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:20,877
# Many lessons I took in the art

640
01:22:21,077 --> 01:22:24,718
# The Cupid, the blagger, while sportin'

641
01:22:24,918 --> 01:22:30,530
# An arrow drove straight through me mush, mush,
mush, toor-i-li-anny

642
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:34,103
# Me mush, mush, mush, toor-i-li-ay

643
01:22:34,304 --> 01:22:39,581
# So I lathered him with me shillelagh

644
01:22:39,781 --> 01:22:44,736
# For he trod on the tail 'o me mush, mush, mush, toor-i-li-anny

645
01:22:45,671 --> 01:22:49,278
# And just like the dingle before

646
01:22:49,479 --> 01:22:52,552
# I lathered him with me shillelagh

647
01:22:52,753 --> 01:22:58,765
# For, he trod on the tail of me coat

648
01:23:05,378 --> 01:23:08,355
Hello, the house! Anyone up?

649
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:14,107
- Good mornin'! - Good mornin'.

650
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:21,189
I... I suppose it's a bit early to be callin'.

651
01:23:21,422 --> 01:23:27,969
After you left last night, Mary Kate,
a couple of us persuaded Danaher to change his mind.

652
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:32,948
It's a... what might be called a sort of
a belated wedding present.

653
01:23:36,865 --> 01:23:40,339
My things... My furniture!

654
01:23:42,576 --> 01:23:46,718
We'd brought them over last night,
but due to the circumstances...

655
01:23:46,919 --> 01:23:49,557
Thanks, thanks.

656
01:23:52,496 --> 01:23:56,204
- Okay, easy now. - God bless all here.

657
01:23:56,739 --> 01:24:01,660
That's right. Oh, be careful. Over there by the wall.

658
01:24:05,201 --> 01:24:09,944
No, no, no. Turn it around, so that
the light shines on the music.

659
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:18,795
- That's grand. That's grand now.
- Where do you want this?

660
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:26,555
- Mighty handy. - It...

661
01:24:26,788 --> 01:24:29,928
It was my mother's, and my mother's mother's before.

662
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:35,941
- Where do I put it? - Where do you suppose?

663
01:24:36,141 --> 01:24:38,914
Where do you suppose...

664
01:24:42,521 --> 01:24:47,498
- We're sorry about the dowry, Mary Kate.
- We couldn't get him to change his mind.

665
01:24:47,733 --> 01:24:51,283
- Not even Father Lonergan could do it.
Let him keep it.

666
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:55,091
- Keep my fortune?
- You've got your tables and chairs.

667
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:57,529
- What do we care about his money?
- My money.

668
01:24:57,730 --> 01:25:00,869
Let him have it if it means that much to him.

669
01:25:05,178 --> 01:25:10,789
- What manner of man is it that I've married?
- A better one, I think, that you know.

670
01:25:27,902 --> 01:25:31,610
Impetuous! Homeric!

671
01:25:37,388 --> 01:25:41,007
#Oh, Inisfree

672
01:25:41,207 --> 01:25:47,386
# My island, I'm returning

673
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:54,935
# From wasted years, across the wintry sea

674
01:25:58,175 --> 01:26:03,188
# And when I come back

675
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:09,308
# To my own dear island

676
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:16,157
# I'll rest awhile

677
01:26:16,357 --> 01:26:20,432
# Beside you

678
01:26:20,665 --> 01:26:25,810
# Bromwell Creek

679
01:27:13,996 --> 01:27:19,047
Now I know why you have so many rock walls in this country.

680
01:27:20,821 --> 01:27:24,028
Roses! Are you plantin' roses?

681
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:26,733
- Yeah. - A fine farmer you are.

682
01:27:26,934 --> 01:27:30,174
- Not a turnip, or a potato in the field. - Or children.

683
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:43,674
Sorry.

684
01:27:47,487 --> 01:27:52,898
Well, I... I suppose they'll make a very fine
display around the cottage.

685
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:58,510
- It is a pretty cottage, isn't it? - I think so.

686
01:28:12,215 --> 01:28:14,520
Let's see now.

687
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:19,464
We need a plough, and a cultivator,
and seed for planting.

688
01:28:19,664 --> 01:28:23,104
About a horse for the ploughing...
We could sell that hunter of yours.

689
01:28:23,305 --> 01:28:27,847
I'll buy another horse for the ploughing.
Why not a tractor?

690
01:28:28,081 --> 01:28:33,832
Oh, a tractor... Nasty, smelly things.
Besides, they're an awful price.

691
01:28:34,034 --> 01:28:38,981
- With a horse, you get other advantages.
- Yeah. For the roses.

692
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:41,820
Roses, again.

693
01:28:43,357 --> 01:28:45,795
You...

694
01:28:49,502 --> 01:28:52,742
We could do our shopping in Castletown,

695
01:28:52,943 --> 01:28:56,483
and if we put a good foot under us,
we'd be back by suppertime.

696
01:28:56,717 --> 01:28:59,163
- Five miles! - Well, that's just a...

697
01:28:59,365 --> 01:29:02,106
Good stretch of the legs, huh?

698
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:07,617
All right, get on your walking shoes.

699
01:29:12,694 --> 01:29:15,166
I'll be a minute.

700
01:29:41,497 --> 01:29:43,802
So, you're not a woman to be honked at, ha?

701
01:29:44,503 --> 01:29:48,047
Why, it's beautiful! Did you ever see...

702
01:29:48,247 --> 01:29:52,498
- It looks like it could fly.
- Only one horsepower, but it's all yours.

703
01:29:53,299 --> 01:29:56,372
- Mine? - Sure. Think you can drive it?

704
01:29:56,606 --> 01:29:58,944
Hold on to your hat!

705
01:31:05,146 --> 01:31:06,950
You take care of that, Feeney.

706
01:31:12,995 --> 01:31:18,139
- Let's have another pint. I'm buying this one.
- High time.

707
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:21,613
- What's that? - I said, that's fine, squire.

708
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:25,387
Good health to you all.

709
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:30,675
- Look, he sold the crossbreds. - The what?

710
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:32,747
- The sheep he's been planning on. - Oh.

711
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,488
Hurry, now is a good time to ask him. Well, go on.

712
01:31:36,655 --> 01:31:39,794
- Ask him what? - About my money.

713
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:41,865
He can't say that he hasn't got it with him now.

714
01:31:42,098 --> 01:31:45,906
Can't you understand that
I didn't marry you for your fortune?

715
01:31:46,107 --> 01:31:51,786
- I don't give... a hang about the money.
- But he does! That's the whole point of it.

716
01:31:52,086 --> 01:31:56,640
- Now will you go and ask him?
- No. Why shame ourselves?

717
01:31:56,773 --> 01:32:02,719
Shame? The shame's on you, not on me.
Or on me too, if I married a coward.

718
01:32:04,322 --> 01:32:06,193
Is that what you think of me?

719
01:32:06,326 --> 01:32:08,797
What else if you let him rob you out of my money?

720
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:14,844
Money! I'm sick of the talk of it.
Is that all you Danahers think about? Money?

721
01:33:48,513 --> 01:33:52,521
Quiet! He's just behind that rock.

722
01:33:52,721 --> 01:33:55,927
- This is very important...
- Oh, salmon! He's winking at me.

723
01:33:56,128 --> 01:33:58,370
I've been trying to catch this one for ten years.

724
01:33:58,571 --> 01:34:02,585
I've got to talk to you about my husband and myself.

725
01:34:02,786 --> 01:34:04,857
There he is.

726
01:34:06,293 --> 01:34:08,898
Father, I... I...

727
01:34:12,138 --> 01:34:13,808
You see...

728
01:34:14,844 --> 01:34:19,520
- Father, could I... tell you in the Irish?
- Hush, hush.

729
01:34:43,747 --> 01:34:46,954
Sleeping bag, Father, with...

730
01:34:48,629 --> 01:34:51,173
...with buttons.

731
01:35:01,661 --> 01:35:06,806
Woman, Ireland may be a poor country, God help us,

732
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:10,914
but here a married man sleeps in a bed, not a bag,

733
01:35:11,114 --> 01:35:16,202
and for your own good... Help, help, there he is!

734
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:20,244
- I've been waiting for this for 10 years!
- Keep his head up.

735
01:35:20,444 --> 01:35:25,188
- There's that beauty, that...
- Keep his head up. Keep a tight line.

736
01:35:25,421 --> 01:35:29,262
I've got you! I'll get him!

737
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:34,039
- Tight line it is. - Keep his head up!

738
01:35:34,272 --> 01:35:36,845
His head is up!

739
01:35:38,485 --> 01:35:43,636
For ten years I have...
Get the net, woman.

740
01:35:43,836 --> 01:35:48,513
Oh, you got him, Father. Keep his head up, you fool!

741
01:35:49,515 --> 01:35:50,885
Get the net!

742
01:35:52,955 --> 01:35:55,493
Get the net, woman!

743
01:35:56,997 --> 01:36:00,704
- God help us! - Oh.

744
01:36:04,588 --> 01:36:06,894
Sleeping bags...

745
01:36:54,746 --> 01:36:59,023
# If you ever go across the sea to Ireland

746
01:36:59,959 --> 01:37:07,106
# Then maybe at the closin' of your day

747
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:12,985
# You will sit and watch the moon rise

748
01:37:13,186 --> 01:37:17,427
# Over Claddagh

749
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:23,117
# And see the sun go down

750
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:29,095
# On Galway Bay

751
01:37:30,766 --> 01:37:37,947
# For the breeze is blowin' across the sea from Ireland

752
01:37:42,423 --> 01:37:45,440
You're just in time. Just done me drink.

753
01:37:45,641 --> 01:37:48,345
- Join us, Sean. - Oh, you will have a drink, Sean?

754
01:37:48,513 --> 01:37:50,517
No, thanks.

755
01:37:53,523 --> 01:37:56,429
I wanna talk to you, in private.

756
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:04,713
- If there's anythin' you got to say, say it here.
- I'd rather talk in private.

757
01:38:04,913 --> 01:38:10,034
What's the matter? You're among friends.
They fought for you, didn't they?

758
01:38:10,235 --> 01:38:15,011
- Maybe they'll do it again.
- I'm not askin' anybody to do my fightin' for me.

759
01:38:15,212 --> 01:38:21,258
- Oh, so you're willing to do your own, are you?
- You know what I came for.

760
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:25,533
I do. I just want to hear you ask for it.

761
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:29,174
Just ask for it, Yank.

762
01:38:29,374 --> 01:38:33,285
- You've got 20 pounds on him.
- And so I have.

763
01:38:34,962 --> 01:38:40,508
What if I put one of me fists in me pocket?
Right or left? You choose, go on.

764
01:38:40,741 --> 01:38:43,882
Go on, that's fair enough, isn't it?

765
01:38:48,892 --> 01:38:51,865
The fightin' Thornton!

766
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:21,636
- It was Mr Thornton, so I brought him in.
- Bless my soul. Sit down.

767
01:39:21,837 --> 01:39:23,913
- Have you tiddled your last wink?
- I have.

768
01:39:24,115 --> 01:39:26,257
- No cheating? - I have not.

769
01:39:26,959 --> 01:39:31,567
- Do you play tiddly-winks? - No, I...

770
01:39:31,768 --> 01:39:37,279
- Maybe I shouldn't have butted in like this...
- Nonsense. How is your lovely bride?

771
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:41,255
- Fine. - Elizabeth, say good night to Mr Thornton.

772
01:39:41,455 --> 01:39:46,965
But he's only just come... oh. Very well.
Good night, Mr Thornton.

773
01:39:47,166 --> 01:39:49,144
- Good night. - Good night, Cyril.

774
01:39:49,345 --> 01:39:53,189
Good night, Elizabeth. Pleasant dreams.

775
01:39:55,494 --> 01:39:58,668
- Are you sure... - Good night, Elizabeth.

776
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:04,145
You're the only one I can level with.
I gotta talk to somebody, or I'll blow my top.

777
01:40:04,346 --> 01:40:07,586
- Danaher, of course? - Yeah.

778
01:40:07,786 --> 01:40:12,530
Since you know who I am... or was,
you know why I don't want any fighting.

779
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:16,281
Yes, I was reading about it again this evening.

780
01:40:16,514 --> 01:40:23,195
Some men collect butterflies, some stamps.
My hobby's always been sporting events.

781
01:40:23,396 --> 01:40:25,433
There it is.

782
01:40:25,634 --> 01:40:27,738
"Trooper Thorn quits ring"

783
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:31,846
"Heavyweight challenger hangs up gloves
after fatal knockout"

784
01:40:32,047 --> 01:40:34,151
"Vows he will never fight again"

785
01:40:36,455 --> 01:40:38,900
It's a very understandable reaction.

786
01:40:39,135 --> 01:40:44,316
The papers all say it was an accident.
Just one of those things.

787
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:50,362
It's just one of those things in a scrapbook,
but when you carry it around in here...

788
01:40:52,266 --> 01:40:56,007
Tony Gardello was a good egg.

789
01:40:56,207 --> 01:41:02,152
Nice little wife and a home, a couple of kids.
A clean fighter.

790
01:41:03,023 --> 01:41:07,875
I didn't go in there to outbox him.
I went there to beat his brains out.

791
01:41:08,075 --> 01:41:12,651
To drive him into the canvas, to murder him.
That's what I did.

792
01:41:13,286 --> 01:41:18,130
For what? Purse, a piece of the gate.

793
01:41:19,833 --> 01:41:21,871
Lousy money.

794
01:41:22,071 --> 01:41:25,578
And now money is behind your trouble with Danaher.

795
01:41:25,779 --> 01:41:31,234
They think I'm afraid of fighting.
All the friends I've made, even my wife.

796
01:41:31,435 --> 01:41:35,810
- Well, aren't you in a way?
- Did you ever kill a man?

797
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:42,490
Well, I have, and all this talk about her big fortune...

798
01:41:43,459 --> 01:41:45,831
It's not that important.

799
01:41:47,066 --> 01:41:49,304
Perhaps it is to her.

800
01:41:50,507 --> 01:41:55,128
It must be strange to you from America,

801
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:59,803
but it's an old, old custom here, and believe me,
it's a good custom.

802
01:42:00,004 --> 01:42:02,877
The fortune means more to her than just the money.

803
01:42:03,077 --> 01:42:06,985
Not to me, it isn't. Not worth fighting for.

804
01:42:07,185 --> 01:42:10,893
- Is your wife's love worth fighting for?
- I don't know.

805
01:42:12,496 --> 01:42:19,586
All I know is that... I won't fight,
unless I'm mad enough to kill,

806
01:42:19,786 --> 01:42:23,496
and if that means losin' her... I don't know.

807
01:42:24,364 --> 01:42:28,674
- Maybe she doesn't love me enough.
- It's a difficult situation.

808
01:42:30,076 --> 01:42:33,584
I think you'll find the right answer in God's good time.

809
01:42:33,817 --> 01:42:37,258
And when that time comes, I hope I'm still here.

810
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:41,366
- You're not leaving, are you?
- It's a possibility.

811
01:42:41,566 --> 01:42:45,285
My bishop is coming tomorrow on his annual visit,

812
01:42:45,519 --> 01:42:50,830
and I've got such a small congregation,
just 2-3 people at the service.

813
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:56,140
- He may transfer me.
- The place wouldn't be the same without you.

814
01:42:57,075 --> 01:43:02,720
Elizabeth and I just love this place.
We were born here too, you know.

815
01:43:03,389 --> 01:43:07,163
The bishop's a good egg, maybe it'll be all right.

816
01:43:07,363 --> 01:43:12,051
Oh, by the way. Don't underestimate Danaher.

817
01:43:12,251 --> 01:43:16,560
He may be clumsy, but he's got
a tremendous right and a jaw of granite.

818
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:22,939
I did a little bit of boxing in my time.

819
01:43:32,527 --> 01:43:34,941
You won't be laughin' now, will you?

820
01:43:37,648 --> 01:43:39,852
It was at Trinity.

821
01:43:40,052 --> 01:43:43,293
"Lightweight champion, 19... "

822
01:43:43,493 --> 01:43:47,467
The year doesn't matter. It was long, long ago.

823
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:53,046
All right.

824
01:43:53,646 --> 01:43:56,385
By the way, would you join me in a glass of...

825
01:43:57,487 --> 01:43:59,567
Oh, no.

826
01:44:00,906 --> 01:44:04,847
No. You'll be in training now, of course.

827
01:45:15,023 --> 01:45:19,199
Did you have any supper? - No.

828
01:45:19,399 --> 01:45:21,537
I'm not hungry.

829
01:45:21,738 --> 01:45:26,748
- The drink sometimes does that to a man.
- I haven't had anything to drink.

830
01:45:26,981 --> 01:45:31,991
If you wanna know, I was talking to the vicar.

831
01:45:33,128 --> 01:45:37,403
- Mr Playfair. - That's strange.

832
01:45:44,528 --> 01:45:46,833
I had a long talk with Father Lonergan.

833
01:46:49,651 --> 01:46:53,026
Woman of the house! Where's me tea?

834
01:46:56,843 --> 01:46:58,346
Mary Kate?

835
01:46:58,546 --> 01:47:04,792
Save your breath, boy.
She's gone from you, and small wonder.

836
01:47:04,993 --> 01:47:10,537
- What are you talking about? Where is she?
- She came tappin' at me door.

837
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:14,011
- "Will you join me to the train", says she. - Why?

838
01:47:14,245 --> 01:47:19,531
The very question. "Why", says I.
"Because I love him", says she.

839
01:47:19,732 --> 01:47:23,275
"I love him too much to go on livin'
with a man I'm ashamed of. "

840
01:47:24,977 --> 01:47:29,687
- What time was this? - Time for the Dublin train.

841
01:47:42,682 --> 01:47:44,995
Saddle up my horse, will you, please.

842
01:47:46,132 --> 01:47:48,136
Saddle his horse?

843
01:47:50,541 --> 01:47:54,115
I'll have no part in helpin'
you to put more shame on her.

844
01:47:55,819 --> 01:47:58,056
Saddle his horse...

845
01:48:01,162 --> 01:48:04,603
Dam da dam da, diddle de da...

846
01:48:33,577 --> 01:48:35,153
Well, we're off!

847
01:48:35,355 --> 01:48:40,064
Then, might I suggest that the train already
is four and a half hours late.

848
01:48:40,264 --> 01:48:43,037
Now, is it my fault?

849
01:48:43,270 --> 01:48:47,480
There's a match at Ballygar, and the champions of all Ireland...

850
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:52,289
If you knew your country's history as well as
you claim to know it,

851
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:58,103
you'd know that they haven't been beaten
west of the Shannon for the last 22 years.

852
01:48:58,304 --> 01:49:01,519
- True! - It's a lie!

853
01:50:09,514 --> 01:50:12,152
If this means what I hope it means...

854
01:50:12,353 --> 01:50:16,439
Danaher versus the Yank.
It'll be weeks on the green this time.

855
01:50:25,023 --> 01:50:26,526
Morning.

856
01:50:35,878 --> 01:50:37,382
Good day to you, sir.

857
01:50:51,054 --> 01:50:54,494
Five minutes, did you say? Right!

858
01:50:55,864 --> 01:51:02,110
- He's walkin' her back, the whole long way!
- It's Homeric, that's what it is, Homeric.

859
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:05,962
- Post a lookout. They may go home first.
- Where's your pistol?.

860
01:51:06,162 --> 01:51:09,135
- In the same place. - Excuse me, general.

861
01:51:10,404 --> 01:51:15,414
One by land, two by sea, and I'll follow the lot.

862
01:51:15,615 --> 01:51:17,218
What a day for Inisfree!

863
01:51:17,419 --> 01:51:22,729
On a day like this I can say only one thing.
Gentlemen, the drinks are on the house!

864
01:51:25,802 --> 01:51:27,775
Well, they are.

865
01:51:58,792 --> 01:52:02,933
Darling, here is your shoe!

866
01:52:07,075 --> 01:52:08,979
Why, you...

867
01:52:13,422 --> 01:52:17,496
It's only five miles. Just a good stretch of the legs.

868
01:52:22,585 --> 01:52:26,226
- You lost your shoe. - Thank you very kindly, sir.

869
01:52:51,422 --> 01:52:58,069
Mr... Mr Sean! Here's
a good stick to beat the lovely lady.

870
01:52:59,604 --> 01:53:01,542
Thanks!

871
01:54:02,433 --> 01:54:07,176
I think your in-laws are comin'
to visit you, Squire Danaher.

872
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:49,581
Danaher, you owe me 350 pounds. Let's have it.

873
01:54:58,737 --> 01:55:01,074
So, the IRA is in this, too, eh?

874
01:55:01,276 --> 01:55:06,753
If it were, Will Danaher, not
a stone of your fine house'd be standin'.

875
01:55:06,987 --> 01:55:09,692
A beautiful sentiment.

876
01:55:13,806 --> 01:55:16,016
I'll pay you... never.

877
01:55:16,216 --> 01:55:19,457
That breaks all bargains.

878
01:55:20,793 --> 01:55:25,035
You can take your sister back.
It's your custom, not mine.

879
01:55:25,236 --> 01:55:28,775
No fortune, no marriage. We call it quits.

880
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:37,729
You'd do this to me, your own wife?

881
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:40,811
After what... - It's done.

882
01:55:49,596 --> 01:55:52,735
There's your dirty money. Take it.

883
01:55:52,970 --> 01:55:56,276
Count it, you spawn, and look.

884
01:55:56,476 --> 01:56:00,619
If ever I see that face of yours again,
I'll push that through it.

885
01:56:18,165 --> 01:56:20,269
Charge it!

886
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:27,987
I'll be goin' on home now.
I'll have the supper ready for you.

887
01:57:07,187 --> 01:57:09,393
All right, Will, you asked for it.

888
01:57:22,096 --> 01:57:25,637
Three to one given on Danaher. Three to one...

889
01:57:25,837 --> 01:57:30,814
- I'll have some of that. Ten on Thornton.
- Done! Anyone else?

890
01:58:25,047 --> 01:58:29,255
Gentlemen, if you please.
This is a private fight.

891
01:58:29,455 --> 01:58:33,735
The Marquis of Queensbury rules
will be observed on all occasions.

892
01:58:33,936 --> 01:58:36,581
Mind your nose, squire.

893
01:58:37,283 --> 01:58:40,021
Okay with me, Michaleen!

894
01:58:43,997 --> 01:58:45,266
Thanks.

895
01:58:45,466 --> 01:58:49,507
Non-belligerents will kindly remain neutral.

896
01:58:49,708 --> 01:58:53,550
Now, shake hands and come out fighting. I thank you.

897
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:57,223
Did you hear that, everybody?
The Marquis of Queensbury rules.

898
01:58:57,457 --> 01:58:59,670
- The Marquis of Queensbury rules. - Mar..

899
01:59:05,051 --> 01:59:08,123
Come on, get up, Marquis of Queensbury.

900
01:59:08,324 --> 01:59:12,766
- I hope that Thornton beats him senseless.
- He's a married man, Sarah.

901
01:59:12,967 --> 01:59:16,841
Who cares about him? It's that big bully concerns me.

902
01:59:17,041 --> 01:59:20,147
"I'm the best man in Inisfree. "
As if I didn't know that.

903
01:59:24,933 --> 01:59:28,944
Call them and tell them to send reinforcements.
There's a riot here.

904
01:59:44,909 --> 01:59:47,114
Five to one on the big chap, Snuffy.

905
01:59:47,315 --> 01:59:50,765
- Given or taken? - Given.

906
02:00:04,294 --> 02:00:07,032
- You've had enough? - No.

907
02:00:12,076 --> 02:00:14,890
Well, give a man a hand, then.

908
02:00:22,408 --> 02:00:24,713
Yes, inspector. Thank you, sir.

909
02:00:24,946 --> 02:00:28,053
- What did he say? - To put five pounds on Danaher's nose.

910
02:00:29,055 --> 02:00:32,829
- Another ten on Thornton! - Another.

911
02:00:34,266 --> 02:00:39,450
- A pound on Danaher. - Two pounds on Danaher, please.

912
02:00:39,652 --> 02:00:42,226
Two pounds?

913
02:00:42,426 --> 02:00:46,201
"... hands of a hundred battles,
eye on a thousand besides... "

914
02:00:46,402 --> 02:00:49,675
"... stood alone on the victorious field,
his buckler bent... "

915
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:52,881
"... his broken sword clutched in his mighty hand... "

916
02:00:53,082 --> 02:00:59,094
"... the blood of a thousand wounds
oozing from his open veins... "

917
02:01:25,927 --> 02:01:29,608
- Father! Father Lonergan! - Shh, shhh.

918
02:01:29,843 --> 02:01:33,353
- A big fight in the town!
- And in this fish right here.

919
02:01:33,553 --> 02:01:37,161
- I'd put a stop to it but...
- You do that. It's your duty.

920
02:01:37,361 --> 02:01:40,467
But you see, it was Danaher and Sean Thornton!

921
02:01:40,667 --> 02:01:43,440
- Who? - Danaher and Sean Thornton.

922
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:46,146
Why the devil didn't you tell me?

923
02:02:03,559 --> 02:02:07,033
- Shouldn't we put a stop to it?
- We should, lad, we should.

924
02:02:07,233 --> 02:02:10,473
It's our duty, yes, it's our duty.

925
02:02:18,057 --> 02:02:20,771
Come on, come on!

926
02:02:27,753 --> 02:02:31,628
- How's that bettin' going?
- Even money, but don't ruin it.

927
02:02:33,565 --> 02:02:37,706
Well, Danaher, you're a good fight,
I'll say that for you.

928
02:02:37,907 --> 02:02:42,216
When it comes to that, it's been a pleasure beatin' you.

929
02:02:49,742 --> 02:02:51,312
Thanks.

930
02:02:52,815 --> 02:02:56,723
- Will you take another 20 on Thornton?
- No, the book's closed.

931
02:02:58,493 --> 02:03:02,902
- A pound on Thornton against the squire.
- Go away!

932
02:03:05,140 --> 02:03:08,383
- How about a drink?
- The drink will be on the house.

933
02:03:08,618 --> 02:03:13,602
That's a good idea. The people of Ballyglon are comin'
over by bus, thousands of them.

934
02:03:13,802 --> 02:03:17,644
That's a good idea, not that I'm tired.
I'm as fresh as a daisy.

935
02:03:17,844 --> 02:03:21,117
You look more like a black-eyed Susan to me. Let's go.

936
02:03:21,585 --> 02:03:25,459
- Is that a public house?
- Yes, your lordship.

937
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:27,664
- Are they going in? - Yes, your lordship.

938
02:03:27,864 --> 02:03:33,044
- Does that mean that the fight's over?
- No, that's just the end of round one.

939
02:03:35,758 --> 02:03:37,729
Come, keep away, keep away!

940
02:03:45,144 --> 02:03:50,990
Whiskey? No, that'll be too warm,
it'll get your blood up. Porter is the very thing.

941
02:03:51,223 --> 02:03:55,565
- Ah, it's peaceful and quiet in here, isn't it?
- Yeah.

942
02:03:55,766 --> 02:03:57,469
You know...

943
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:02,724
This has been a fight I'd come a long way to see.

944
02:04:02,924 --> 02:04:05,530
I hope you can stick around for the finish.

945
02:04:06,932 --> 02:04:09,571
Don't worry about that!

946
02:04:12,811 --> 02:04:18,489
- You know, Yank. I've taken quite a likin' to you.
- I'm gettin' real fond of you, too.

947
02:04:19,458 --> 02:04:23,671
Your widow, me sister... She could've done a lot worse.

948
02:04:23,872 --> 02:04:25,849
- True, true. - Poor woman.

949
02:04:26,083 --> 02:04:29,757
- Thanks, fill them up again.
- You buy me no drinks.

950
02:04:29,957 --> 02:04:34,433
- The drinks are on the house, sir.
- I'm takin' no drinks from you, squint.

951
02:04:34,633 --> 02:04:38,675
- I'm buyin' the drinks.
- You can buy me a drink at your wake.

952
02:04:38,876 --> 02:04:40,847
And not before.

953
02:04:42,984 --> 02:04:44,688
I'm buyin'!

954
02:04:49,068 --> 02:04:51,546
Bar towel!

955
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:58,059
- What time is it? - Half past five, sir.

956
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:06,009
Lord, he beat you!

957
02:05:16,174 --> 02:05:22,453
Why... I hope you won't be vexed with me,
but I've lost three pounds to Mrs Delany.

958
02:05:22,688 --> 02:05:25,259
I know I shouldn't have bet but...

959
02:05:25,493 --> 02:05:28,265
There you are, Stuffy, 15 pounds.

960
02:05:30,937 --> 02:05:34,712
- Hello there, Elizabeth. - Your lordship.

961
02:05:34,912 --> 02:05:39,931
- And what have you been doing all day?
- If you'll excuse me, I'll...

962
02:05:40,132 --> 02:05:42,973
I'll get your tea, Snuffy.

963
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:49,419
# There was a wild colonial boy

964
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:52,827
#Jack Duggan was his name

965
02:05:53,027 --> 02:05:57,169
# He was born and bred in Ireland

966
02:05:57,369 --> 02:06:01,144
# In a place called Castlemaine

967
02:06:01,344 --> 02:06:05,294
# He was his father's only son

968
02:06:05,495 --> 02:06:09,004
# His mother's pride and joy

969
02:06:09,204 --> 02:06:13,212
# And dearly did his parents love

970
02:06:13,413 --> 02:06:17,788
# This wild colonial boy

971
02:06:29,251 --> 02:06:33,364
Woman of the house! I brought the brother home to supper.

972
02:06:34,668 --> 02:06:37,373
He's kindly welcome.

973
02:06:38,609 --> 02:06:40,580
God bless all in this house.

974
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:42,650
- Wipe your feet. - Thank you, ma'am.

975
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:46,458
Sit down, sit down. That's what chairs are for.

976
02:06:51,669 --> 02:06:53,979
Hurry it up!

977
02:07:01,132 --> 02:07:06,644
Well, then. So peace and quiet came once again to Inisfree,

978
02:07:06,844 --> 02:07:10,218
and we were... Good heavens, what's that woman up to now.?

979
02:07:10,418 --> 02:07:13,825
Make way, she'll be runnin'you down with that.!

980
02:07:23,957 --> 02:07:27,497
When the Reverend Mr Playfair comes down,

981
02:07:27,698 --> 02:07:31,305
I want us all to cheer like Protestants. Now, spread out!

982
02:07:47,149 --> 02:07:51,357
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

983
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:11,977
No patty fingers, if you please.
The proprieties at all times.

984
02:08:13,848 --> 02:08:16,252
Hold on to your hats. Come on.
