1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,207
<i>You wanna talk about</i>
<i>the vanishing wilderness?</i>

2
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:11,210
<i>Why are you so anxious about this?</i>

3
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:14,213
<i>Because they're building a dam</i>
<i>across the Cahulawasse River.</i>

4
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:16,841
<i>They're gonna flood a whole valley, Bobby.</i>

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,886
<i>They're drowning the river, man.</i>

6
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:25,434
<i>- We're talkin' to you.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,351
<i>Just about the last wild, untamed,</i>
<i>unpolluted, unfucked-up river in the South.</i>

8
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:34,320
<i>- Don't you understand?</i>
<i>- We understand.</i>

9
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:38,659
<i>There ain't gonna be no more river.</i>
<i>Just gonna be a big, dead lake.</i>

10
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:42,038
<i>It's a very clean way</i>
<i>to make electric power.</i>

11
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:44,749
<i>Those lakes provide many people</i>
<i>with recreation.</i>

12
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:49,463
<i>My father-in-law has a houseboat</i>
<i>on Lake Bowie.</i>

13
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:55,929
<i>You push a little more power into Atlanta...</i>

14
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:59,308
<i>... a little more air conditioners</i>
<i>for your smug little suburb...</i>

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,397
<i>... and you know what's gonna happen?</i>
<i>They're gonna rape this whole landscape.</i>

16
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,399
<i>They're gonna rape it.</i>

17
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,778
<i>- That's an extreme point of view, Lewis.</i>
<i>- It is.</i>

18
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:10,321
<i>Extremist.</i>

19
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:50,286
<i>We're gonna leave Friday from Atlanta.</i>

20
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,706
<i>I'm gonna have you back</i>
<i>in your little suburban house...</i>

21
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:56,835
<i>... in time to see the football game</i>
<i>on Sunday afternoon.</i>

22
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:00,673
<i>I know you'll be back in time to see</i>
<i>the pompom girls at halftime.</i>

23
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:02,509
<i>I know that's all you care about.</i>

24
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,761
<i>Lewis, I wanna thank you.</i>

25
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:14,815
<i>Is there any hillbillies up here?</i>

26
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:18,945
<i>Yeah, there's some people up there</i>
<i>that ain't never seen a town before.</i>

27
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:22,658
<i>No bigger than Aintry, anyway.</i>
<i>Them, those woods, are real deep.</i>

28
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:25,911
<i>The river's inaccessible,</i>
<i>except at a couple of points.</i>

29
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:28,164
<i>How we gonna get there, Lewis?</i>

30
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,502
<i>I'm gonna take you there.</i>

31
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,421
<i>What the hell do you know about canoein'?</i>

32
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:37,676
<i>I know enough about canoein'</i>
<i>to handle the both of you.</i>

33
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,931
<i>I don't know what that means,</i>
<i>but I'll go along with you.</i>

34
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:46,477
<i>This is the last chance we got</i>
<i>to see this river.</i>

35
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:49,106
<i>Just wait until you feel</i>
<i>that white water under you.</i>

36
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:51,984
<i>- Ain't that right?</i>
<i>- I don't know if I'm ready.</i>

37
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:03,707
If we are lost, I don't wanna hear about it.

38
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:06,084
I've never been lost in my life.

39
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:09,589
I'll have you in the water in another hour.

40
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:14,720
Christ, Drew!

41
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:17,764
Drew, look at the junk.

42
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,018
Look here.

43
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:25,399
I think this is where everything finishes up.

44
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:27,610
We just may be at the end of the line.

45
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:31,031
Hey, not so loud, Bobby.
Let's not upset these people.

46
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,491
People?

47
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:37,413
What people?

48
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:41,043
This area may be evacuated already.

49
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,262
That's my '51 Dodge.

50
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,557
No, that's my car. That's my car.

51
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,897
All my youth and passion...

52
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:00,983
...spent in that back seat.

53
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,987
It's all gone you see.

54
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:07,658
All gone. Rust and dust.

55
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:14,874
Lewis...

56
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,419
...we got a live one here.

57
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:22,551
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

58
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,262
Let me ask you something.

59
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:30,059
Are you from the power company?

60
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:31,894
Power company?

61
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:34,273
What power company?

62
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:36,942
About the dam.

63
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,154
No, no, no.

64
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,031
Look, come here a minute.
See that car there?

65
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,745
We want somebody to drive 'em
down to Aintry for us.

66
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,292
Hell, you're crazy.

67
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,919
No shit.

68
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,133
Fill that one up with gas, okay?

69
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:08,438
Say, mister...

70
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,233
I love the way you wear that hat.

71
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,834
You don't know nothin'.

72
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:14,016
Lewis, just ask him about his hat.

73
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:35,625
I don't think you understood me.
I wanna get some drivers...

74
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:38,004
...to drive this car...

75
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,548
...and that car down to Aintry.

76
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:41,799
You understand?

77
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:43,969
You might get the Griner brothers.

78
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,431
- Who?
- The Griner brothers.

79
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,851
Where do they live?

80
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,020
They live back over that way.

81
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:10,125
$4.99.

82
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,627
Right.

83
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,473
Talk about genetic deficiencies.

84
00:07:23,265 --> 00:07:24,642
Isn't that pitiful?

85
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,312
Who's pickin' the banjo here?

86
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:50,756
Come on, I'm with you.

87
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:18,653
I'm lost.

88
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:26,204
I could play all day with that guy.

89
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:29,332
I believe you could, too.
I believe you could.

90
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,377
- That's good.
- That's very good, sir.

91
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,546
Goddamn, you play a mean banjo.

92
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,469
Hey, you wanna play another one?

93
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,473
Give him a couple of bucks.

94
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,394
Can that Chubby boy handle himself?

95
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,980
Who? Bobby?

96
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:53,194
He's rather well thought of
in his field, Lewis.

97
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,614
Insurance?

98
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:17,723
I've never been insured in my life.
I don't believe in insurance.

99
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,604
There's no risk.

100
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:29,446
I have some.

101
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:54,725
Over here.

102
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,489
Shit!

103
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:07,991
God almighty!

104
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:19,088
Anything we can do for you?

105
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:23,260
No. It ain't as bad as I thought.

106
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:27,265
Your name Griner?

107
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,101
What do you wanna know for?

108
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,066
Can you and your brother drive two cars
down to Aintry for us?

109
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,695
Drive 'em down there for what?

110
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:43,284
Me and my buddy, we're gonna take
a canoe trip down the Cahulawasse.

111
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,579
We'd like to have them cars in Aintry
when we get there.

112
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:48,790
Be there by Sunday noon.

113
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:50,500
Canoe trip?

114
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:54,046
That's right, a canoe trip.

115
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,595
What the hell you wanna go fuck around
in that river for?

116
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,892
Because it's there.

117
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,564
It's there all right.

118
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:12,526
You get in there and can't get out,
you gonna wish it wasn't.

119
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:17,282
Listen, Lewis, let's go back to town and...

120
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:18,993
...play golf.

121
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:26,710
I'll give you $30 to take those cars
down to Aintry.

122
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:31,674
I'd take $50.

123
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,096
$50, my ass.

124
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,808
Lewis, don't play games with these people.

125
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:41,394
What'd you say?

126
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,775
I said, "$50, my ass."

127
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:47,735
Lewis!

128
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:55,118
I'll do it for $40.

129
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:00,876
You good for $10?

130
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:02,169
Sure.

131
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,879
You got it.

132
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,677
Brando!

133
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:11,179
- Lewis, you guys all right?
- All set.

134
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:12,807
Brando, come on out!

135
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:15,601
- We heard all this...
- I said it's all set, Drew.

136
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:17,938
This river cruise gonna happen or not?

137
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:19,982
Just get in your car, huh?

138
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:44,845
Lewis, for God's sake!

139
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:58,319
You think we should let 'em
show us to the river?

140
00:13:58,444 --> 00:14:01,448
If I thought that,
I would have let them go first, Ed.

141
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,283
We know about where it is.

142
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:09,291
Here we go.

143
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,721
Well, we fucked up.

144
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,728
You better let them show us.

145
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:29,189
You're missin' the whole point, Ed.

146
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,448
Where are you goin', city boy?

147
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:38,533
We'll find it.

148
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:41,329
It's only the biggest fuckin' river
in the state.

149
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:42,914
We'll find it.

150
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,096
Lewis, you son of a bitch,
why do we have to go so damn fast?

151
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:57,807
You're gonna like it.

152
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,601
When you see the river,
you're gonna like it.

153
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:09,904
Jesus Christ!

154
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:17,539
- Lewis.
- Are you all right?

155
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:28,552
Lewis, you are gonna kill us both,
you son of a bitch...

156
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,637
...before we ever see any water.

157
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,517
Slow it down, Lewis, come on.
Come on, don't fool around.

158
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:48,993
Listen, Ed.

159
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,039
Listen.

160
00:15:58,503 --> 00:15:59,631
Hear it?

161
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:30,500
Sometimes you have to lose yourself
before you can find anything.

162
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:34,838
Any snakes around here?

163
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:44,225
This is the one.

164
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:47,688
There she is.

165
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:55,989
Looks good.

166
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,289
A couple of more months
and she'll all be gone.

167
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:05,458
Even up as far as here?

168
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:08,629
From Aintry on up.

169
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:12,843
One big, dead lake.

170
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:15,053
Over here!

171
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:19,976
Couldn't we have found a harder place
to get in?

172
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:22,353
- This is steep here, now.
- All right.

173
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:24,481
- Watch yourself.
- I'm watchin'.

174
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:29,279
You're losin' glass on your bow.

175
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:30,655
It's freezin'!

176
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,157
Hell, it'll hold.

177
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,910
What the hell are we gonna do...

178
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:39,249
...if we come off this river
and our cars aren't there?

179
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,709
They'll be there.

180
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,961
They're rough-lookin' boys, them hillbillies.

181
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:46,174
You judge people by the way they look.
You can trust 'em.

182
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:53,432
I'm goin' with you, Ed,
and not with Mr. Lewis Medlock.

183
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:55,977
I saw how he drives these country roads...

184
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:57,938
...he don't know nothin' about.

185
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:02,109
I guess you're gonna be with me, Chubby.
Get them supplies up there.

186
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:04,737
It's cold!

187
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,239
Put this on.

188
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:09,576
Looks like my mama's corset or something.

189
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:12,121
Here you go.

190
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:13,456
Thank you.

191
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,375
- Okay, let's go.
- I'm comin'.

192
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,170
Can't go in the water
without your paddle, boy.

193
00:18:18,504 --> 00:18:21,091
I coulda went up the river without my oar.

194
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,718
Shit!

195
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:26,305
If we hit any strong water...

196
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:29,350
...instead of bare-assin' through it...
- I'm ready.

197
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,935
- Come on.
- I'm comin' on.

198
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:33,063
I got myself a plump partner here.

199
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:35,649
We can save ourselves
considerable hardship...

200
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:38,695
...if we just back water,
talk it out before we make our move.

201
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,071
You got that, boy?

202
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,324
All right, put on your life jacket.

203
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,244
Which way are we goin'?

204
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,872
I think downstream would be a good idea,
don't you?

205
00:18:47,998 --> 00:18:49,165
All right.

206
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,378
You and Bobby see some rocks,
you yell out now, right?

207
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:56,007
Lewis, is this the way
you get your rocks off?

208
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:58,510
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

209
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:01,096
- Keep your eyes open, Drew.
- I'll race you.

210
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:02,849
Keep your eyes open, Robert.

211
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,893
That a boy, that a boy.

212
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,648
Every move you make, call it out.
I'm behind you.

213
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,233
Right. Here we go.

214
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,570
See how fast we can shoot this bush.

215
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,696
What is this?

216
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,490
Is this some fast water we're comin' up to?

217
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,162
All right, Drew,
just get in behind Lewis there.

218
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,122
Look at this!

219
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:26,501
- Let's pick up some speed.
- All right. Let's go.

220
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,754
Just a little, there you have it.

221
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:50,614
To the left.

222
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:54,076
Hey, now, that didn't hurt too bad, did it?

223
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,623
I'm with you, Ed.

224
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,086
Now you got it, boy. Very good.

225
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:21,776
Look, Ed.

226
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,941
Well, for the Lord's sake,
will you look at that?

227
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,152
What do we do now?

228
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,246
This is gonna be fun!

229
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:44,999
Just follow us!

230
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,087
Hey, what happens
if we flip this thing over?

231
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:51,424
Now that you brought that up,
hang on to your paddle.

232
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:55,929
And if you hit any rocks,
don't hit 'em with your head.

233
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:57,723
Watch Lewis.

234
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,726
Maybe we can learn something.
Back water now.

235
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,319
Oh, yeah.

236
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:10,488
Go right.

237
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:12,533
Go right, go right.

238
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,370
Go right, go right.

239
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,041
- Look up ahead where you're goin'!
- All right, I'm lookin'.

240
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:26,132
Don't quit, don't quit.
Come on, paddle, paddle.

241
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:27,926
Okay!

242
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:34,600
We did it!

243
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:43,361
Are you gonna call them out now?

244
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:46,156
- Right, go right.
- Go right.

245
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,407
All right, now left.

246
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,993
Left, to your left.

247
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,245
All right.

248
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:57,961
- Keep it straight.
- Watch that tree.

249
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,922
- Left.
- Watch your head.

250
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:01,549
We ain't gonna make it!

251
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:04,803
Turn it!

252
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:13,021
Hey, this doesn't seem right.

253
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:17,568
Just a little unorthodox.

254
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:24,743
Go left, Chubby. Come on.
Straighten it out.

255
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:26,746
All right, I got it straight.

256
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:30,333
Oh, my God!

257
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,921
- Yes, thank you, Lord.
- Turn it around.

258
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,132
Hold it up there. Slow it down.

259
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:37,801
All right, go.

260
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:39,010
Go!

261
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:42,556
Good, push straight ahead.

262
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:46,561
Hell, here's a big one!

263
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:49,690
We're gonna make it. Keep it straight.

264
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:51,191
I'm with you, Ed!

265
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:02,622
All right. You're doin' all right, now.

266
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:08,921
Keep her headed right.

267
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:15,554
Go, go, go...

268
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:25,899
There's a rock!

269
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:28,445
On the right, watch it now.

270
00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:30,613
- Okay, now.
- I got it.

271
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,496
All right now, Chubby, don't fall apart.

272
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:48,801
What the hell I tell you?
He's something else, ain't he?

273
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:52,139
- Hold on.
- I'll tell you, Lewis...

274
00:24:52,264 --> 00:24:55,352
...that's the best,
the second best sensation I ever felt.

275
00:24:55,643 --> 00:24:57,520
You did good, Chubby, you did good.

276
00:24:57,645 --> 00:25:00,566
Damn, I thought we'd bought
the farm there for a while.

277
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:02,276
You know that one place there...

278
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,528
You know what I was just thinking?

279
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:07,616
The first explorers saw this country...

280
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,453
...saw it just like us.

281
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,789
In a canoe.

282
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,208
I can imagine how they felt.

283
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:18,629
Yeah, we beat it, didn't we?

284
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:21,591
Didn't we beat that?

285
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,427
You don't beat it.

286
00:25:26,013 --> 00:25:27,807
You don't beat this river.

287
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:17,657
Machines are gonna fail.

288
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:20,161
And the system's gonna fail.

289
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,041
Then...

290
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,002
And then what?

291
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,131
Then survival.
Who has the ability to survive.

292
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,967
That's the game: Survive.

293
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:37,806
And you can't wait for it to happen,
can you?

294
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,726
You can't wait for it.

295
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:43,688
Well, the system's done all right by me.

296
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:46,400
Oh, yeah.

297
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:50,280
You got a nice job.

298
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:53,158
Got a nice house...

299
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:55,703
...nice wife...

300
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:57,538
...nice kid.

301
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:00,876
You make that sound...

302
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:03,837
...rather shitty, Lewis.

303
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,218
Why do you go on these trips with me, Ed?

304
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:11,764
I like my life, Lewis.

305
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:19,523
Yeah, but why do you go
on these trips with me?

306
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:23,319
You know, sometimes I wonder about that.

307
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,834
Here's to you, Lewis.

308
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:39,422
Hot damn, he got one!

309
00:27:41,674 --> 00:27:43,051
Terrific, Lewis.

310
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:45,178
I hate him.

311
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,109
I'm glad we came here.

312
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,278
Lewis?

313
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,989
Lewis does not drink.

314
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:09,654
It's true, Lewis, what you said.

315
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:15,119
There's somethin' in the woods
and the water that we have lost in the city.

316
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:19,082
We didn't lose it, just sold it.

317
00:29:21,084 --> 00:29:23,129
Well, I'll say one thing for the system.

318
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:26,632
System did produce the air mattress.

319
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:31,805
Or, as it's better known among
we camping types, the instant broad.

320
00:29:34,851 --> 00:29:39,148
And if you fellas will excuse me,
I'm gonna go be mean to my air mattress.

321
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:44,779
I do baptize thee now,
in the name of modern technology.

322
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:47,031
How sweet, yeah.

323
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:58,796
Lewis?

324
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,717
Does he think he is Tarzan, or what?

325
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,729
He knows the woods, though.
He really does.

326
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:14,063
Not really.

327
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,652
He learned 'em, he doesn't feel 'em.
That's his problem.

328
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:21,239
He wants to be one with nature
and he can't hack it.

329
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:23,867
This is a hell of a time to be tellin' us that.

330
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:41,180
Jesus!

331
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:43,516
Lewis, you scared the shit out of me!

332
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,061
Oh, who was it, Lewis?

333
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:53,194
I don't know. I thought I heard something.

334
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:55,196
Something or someone?

335
00:30:58,617 --> 00:30:59,910
I don't know.

336
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:15,137
Good night, Lewis.

337
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:17,515
Good night, Drew.

338
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:22,145
I'm goin' to sleep.

339
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:29,446
Night has fallen.

340
00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:32,740
And there's nothin' we can do about it.

341
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,164
I had my first wet dream in a sleepin' bag.

342
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:39,708
How was it?

343
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,251
Great.

344
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,046
There's no repeatin' it.

345
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:45,548
Never mind.

346
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:57,353
No matter what disaster may occur
in other parts of the world...

347
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:02,818
...or what petty little problems...

348
00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:04,905
...arise in Atlanta...

349
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:08,492
...no one can find us up here.

350
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,418
Good night, Lewis.

351
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:24,476
Goddamn it!

352
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:35,113
Hey, Bobby,
look what came out of the forest.

353
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,241
Get a shot, Ed?

354
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:41,787
Hell, sometimes a man can...

355
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:43,915
...hunt for three years...

356
00:35:44,123 --> 00:35:47,294
...never get a shot. Isn't that right, Lewis?
- Right.

357
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:50,131
I don't understand
how anyone could shoot an animal.

358
00:35:50,256 --> 00:35:52,133
Some people never can, Drew.

359
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:55,387
I've known tournament archers,
damn good shots.

360
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:57,765
Never out of the five ring.

361
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,727
Draw down on a live animal
and they get buck fever.

362
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,814
What the hell's that?

363
00:36:04,105 --> 00:36:06,776
Loss of control, psychological.

364
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:08,945
Who gives a shit?

365
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:12,991
You take that Chubby boy
with you today, okay?

366
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,797
Hope we can get off this river today.

367
00:36:24,922 --> 00:36:26,382
Don't get too far ahead, now.

368
00:36:26,507 --> 00:36:28,301
No, we'll be takin' it slow.

369
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,016
Easy, easy, my man.

370
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:37,228
I got eaten alive last night.
My bites have got bites.

371
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:39,148
I'm a salesman, Ed.

372
00:36:40,524 --> 00:36:41,692
Good morning.

373
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:46,239
I'm not mad at you, Ed.
Just do me a favor, don't holler at me.

374
00:36:46,364 --> 00:36:48,325
I'm not used to bein' hollered at.

375
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:51,412
Damn friend of yours screamed at me
all day long yesterday.

376
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:53,331
Paddle, you son of a bitch.

377
00:37:46,728 --> 00:37:47,729
Look!

378
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:05,124
What in the hell are Lewis and Drew
doin' up there anyway?

379
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,255
Probably they're doin'
the same thing we are.

380
00:38:29,362 --> 00:38:30,446
Bobby?

381
00:38:53,975 --> 00:38:55,351
How goes it?

382
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:03,235
What the hell you think you're doing?

383
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:08,033
Headin' downriver.

384
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:11,996
Little canoe trip. Headin' for Aintry.

385
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:13,539
Aintry?

386
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,669
Sure, this river only runs one way, Captain.
Haven't you heard?

387
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:20,882
You ain't never gonna get down to Aintry.

388
00:39:21,674 --> 00:39:23,092
Why not?

389
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:25,387
'Cause.

390
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,224
This river don't go to Aintry.

391
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:31,269
You done taken the wrong turn.

392
00:39:31,895 --> 00:39:35,398
See, this here river don't go nowhere
near Aintry.

393
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:41,698
Where does it go then?

394
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:51,209
Boy, you are lost.

395
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:54,338
Well, hell, I guess this river
comes out somewhere, don't it?

396
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:56,758
That's where we're going, somewhere.

397
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:59,052
Look, we don't want any trouble here.

398
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:02,181
If you gentlemen have a still near here,
that's fine with us.

399
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:05,268
Why sure. We'd never tell anybody
where it is.

400
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:07,521
You know something?
You're right, we're lost.

401
00:40:07,604 --> 00:40:10,440
- We don't know where in the hell we are.
- A still?

402
00:40:10,566 --> 00:40:13,278
Right, yeah, you're makin' whiskey up here.

403
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:15,488
We'll buy some. We could use it.

404
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:17,323
Do you know what you're talkin' about?

405
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:19,410
We don't know what you're talking about.

406
00:40:19,493 --> 00:40:22,788
You said something about makin' whiskey.
Ain't that what you said?

407
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:27,127
We don't know what you're doing,
and we don't care.

408
00:40:28,086 --> 00:40:29,380
That's none of our business.

409
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:31,674
That's right,
none of your goddamn business.

410
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:34,386
We've got quite a long journey
ahead of us, gentlemen...

411
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:35,470
Hold it.

412
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:37,973
You ain't going no damn where!

413
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,438
This is ridiculous. Excuse me.

414
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:46,984
Hold it, or I'll blow your guts out
all over these woods.

415
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:53,575
Wait, we can talk this thing over.

416
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,536
What is it you require of us?

417
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,457
Well, we require that you get
your goddamn ass up in them woods.

418
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,461
- All right, now, look.
- Right now! You get up there now.

419
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,879
Okay, all right.

420
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,673
- Get up there.
- All right.

421
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,217
Faster, boy.

422
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:10,221
- Move your ass.
- Easy with the weapon!

423
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:11,639
You shut up.

424
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:13,390
- Come on.
- Okay.

425
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:15,267
- Back here.
- What's the trouble?

426
00:41:15,352 --> 00:41:18,480
- You're in trouble.
- Just don't argue with 'em, Ed.

427
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:21,359
- See that saplin' over yonder?
- You heard him.

428
00:41:21,776 --> 00:41:23,361
Back up against this.

429
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:25,906
Is this a matter of money?

430
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:27,449
If we want money, we'll take it.

431
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:31,412
- Back up against the tree.
- I'm pretty far back against it now.

432
00:41:31,538 --> 00:41:34,874
Now, stay just there. Now, be real still.

433
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:39,296
If he tries that again, shoot that one there.

434
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,008
I'll blow his damned balls off.

435
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:44,678
You ain't a big boy.

436
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:46,638
Be still now.

437
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:02,365
Now let's you just drop them pants.

438
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:04,827
Drop?

439
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,787
Just take 'em right off!

440
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:09,249
I mean, what's this all about?

441
00:42:09,332 --> 00:42:11,543
Don't say anything, just do it.

442
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,462
Just drop 'em, boy!

443
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:19,761
You ever had your balls cut off,
you fuckin' ape?

444
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:22,139
Lord.

445
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:27,854
Look there, that's sharp.
I bet it'd shave a hair.

446
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,274
Why don't you try it and see?

447
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,068
Lord. Deliver us from all...

448
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:40,202
Pull off that little bitty shirt there, too.

449
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:47,419
Is he bleeding?

450
00:42:47,836 --> 00:42:49,046
He bled.

451
00:42:52,508 --> 00:42:54,552
Them panties, take 'em off.

452
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:17,288
Get up, boy!

453
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:19,916
Come on, get on up there.

454
00:43:23,837 --> 00:43:25,422
No, no, no.

455
00:43:27,884 --> 00:43:29,386
Oh, no. Don't.

456
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:32,974
- Don't.
- Hey, boy.

457
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,018
- You look just like a hog.
- No, don't.

458
00:43:36,102 --> 00:43:39,898
Just like a hog.
Come here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

459
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:42,235
Come on, piggy. Come on, piggy.

460
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:44,654
Come on, piggy, give me a ride.

461
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:47,992
- Get up and give me a ride.
- All right.

462
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:50,286
- Get up and give me a ride.
- All right.

463
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,415
- Get up! Get up there!
- All right.

464
00:43:58,504 --> 00:43:59,755
Oh, no, no.

465
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,694
Looks like we got us a sow here
instead of a boar.

466
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:22,282
Don't!

467
00:44:22,866 --> 00:44:23,950
Don't!

468
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,666
What's the matter, boy?

469
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,752
I bet you squeal.

470
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,837
I bet you can squeal like a pig.

471
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,882
Let's squeal. Squeal now.

472
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,592
Squeal.

473
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,302
Squeal.

474
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,347
Squeal louder. Louder.

475
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:43,807
Louder.

476
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:45,727
Louder.

477
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:47,896
Louder!

478
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:50,148
Louder! Get down now, boy!

479
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,656
There, get them britches down.
That's that.

480
00:44:57,824 --> 00:45:00,244
You can do better than that, boy.

481
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:02,080
Come on, squeal. Squeal!

482
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,126
What's you wanna do with him?

483
00:46:51,377 --> 00:46:53,754
He got a real pretty mouth, ain't he?

484
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:56,758
That's the truth.

485
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:05,518
You're gonna do some prayin' for me, boy.

486
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:07,646
And you better pray good.

487
00:47:15,405 --> 00:47:17,491
Here, hold that on him.

488
00:47:34,303 --> 00:47:36,847
You better run, you son of a bitch!

489
00:48:50,142 --> 00:48:52,020
Can't we do anything for him?

490
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:54,481
No.

491
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,358
It's a center shot.

492
00:48:58,027 --> 00:49:00,113
I thought they'd surely kill us.

493
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:03,242
They would have.

494
00:49:05,828 --> 00:49:07,580
They would have for sure.

495
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,962
What we gonna do with him?

496
00:49:17,008 --> 00:49:19,011
There's not but one thing to do:

497
00:49:20,971 --> 00:49:22,889
Take the body down to Aintry.

498
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:26,728
Turn it over to the highway patrol.
Tell 'em what happened.

499
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:32,776
Tell 'em what, exactly?

500
00:49:36,906 --> 00:49:38,408
Just what happened.

501
00:49:40,328 --> 00:49:42,872
This is justifiable homicide if anything is.

502
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,962
They were sexually assaulting
two members of our party at gunpoint.

503
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,176
Like you said, there was nothin' else
we could do.

504
00:49:54,552 --> 00:49:55,638
Is he alive?

505
00:50:00,352 --> 00:50:01,478
Not now.

506
00:50:07,485 --> 00:50:09,612
Well, let's get our heads together.

507
00:50:09,695 --> 00:50:12,157
Come on, let's not do anything foolish.

508
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:19,958
Anybody know anything about the law?

509
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:31,346
I was on jury duty once.

510
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:37,229
It wasn't a murder trial.

511
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,482
Murder trial?

512
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:45,321
I don't know the technical word for it,
Drew, but I know this:

513
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:50,494
You take this man and turn him over
to the sheriff, there'll be a trial all right.

514
00:50:50,577 --> 00:50:51,870
Trial by jury.

515
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:56,001
So what?

516
00:50:57,585 --> 00:50:59,171
We killed a man, Drew.

517
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:01,716
Shot him in the back.

518
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:04,011
A mountain man.

519
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,430
Cracker.

520
00:51:07,806 --> 00:51:09,892
Gives us somethin' to consider.

521
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:14,898
All right, consider it. We're listening.

522
00:51:16,942 --> 00:51:19,070
Shit, all these people are related.

523
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:22,240
I'll be damned if I'll come back
and stand trial...

524
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:24,285
...with this man's aunt and uncle...

525
00:51:24,618 --> 00:51:27,621
...maybe his mama and his daddy
sittin' in the jury box.

526
00:51:28,456 --> 00:51:30,208
What do you think, Bobby?

527
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:42,139
How about you, Ed?

528
00:51:44,725 --> 00:51:46,895
I don't know. I really don't know.

529
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,650
Now you listen, Lewis.
I don't know what you got in mind...

530
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,403
...but if you conceal this body,
you'll be charged with murder.

531
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:55,906
That much law I do know.

532
00:52:01,245 --> 00:52:03,539
This ain't one of your fuckin' games!

533
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:07,836
You killed somebody!

534
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:09,838
There he is!

535
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,633
I see him, Drew.

536
00:52:13,176 --> 00:52:15,220
That's right, I killed somebody.

537
00:52:16,972 --> 00:52:19,975
But you're wrong if you don't see this
as a game.

538
00:52:21,812 --> 00:52:25,273
Now you listen, Ed!
Damn it, we can get out of this thing!

539
00:52:25,691 --> 00:52:27,610
Without any questions asked!

540
00:52:28,027 --> 00:52:30,822
We get connected up with that body
and the law...

541
00:52:31,864 --> 00:52:35,327
...this thing's gonna be hangin' over us
the rest of our lives.

542
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:38,039
We gotta get rid of that guy.

543
00:52:39,207 --> 00:52:42,168
Just how are you gonna do that, Lewis?
Where?

544
00:52:44,213 --> 00:52:45,381
Anywhere.

545
00:52:51,388 --> 00:52:52,681
Everywhere.

546
00:53:00,065 --> 00:53:01,150
Nowhere.

547
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,656
How do you know that other guy
hasn't already gone for the police?

548
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:10,911
What in the hell is
he gonna tell 'em, Drew?

549
00:53:11,245 --> 00:53:12,747
What he did to Bobby?

550
00:53:20,381 --> 00:53:22,633
Why couldn't he go get
some other mountain men?

551
00:53:22,717 --> 00:53:24,928
Now why isn't he gonna do that?

552
00:53:25,512 --> 00:53:27,431
You look around you, Lewis!

553
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:31,853
He could be out there anywhere,
watchin' us right now.

554
00:53:31,936 --> 00:53:35,566
We ain't gonna be so goddamned
hard to follow, draggin' a corpse.

555
00:53:40,614 --> 00:53:42,741
You let me worry about that, Drew.

556
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,620
You let me take care of that.

557
00:53:46,454 --> 00:53:50,208
You know what's gonna be here?
Right here. A lake.

558
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:52,586
As far as you can see.

559
00:53:54,088 --> 00:53:55,673
Hundreds of feet deep.

560
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,592
Hundreds of feet deep.

561
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,305
Did you ever look over a lake...

562
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:05,142
...and think about somethin' buried
underneath it?

563
00:54:05,434 --> 00:54:06,978
Buried underneath it!

564
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,276
Man, that's about as buried as you can get!

565
00:54:14,195 --> 00:54:17,825
Well, I am telling you, Lewis,
I don't want any part of it.

566
00:54:17,908 --> 00:54:19,702
Well, you are part of it!

567
00:54:21,453 --> 00:54:23,998
It is a matter of the law!

568
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:25,834
The law?

569
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:27,670
The law?

570
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:29,714
What law?

571
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:34,928
Where's the law, Drew?

572
00:54:39,308 --> 00:54:41,519
You believe in democracy, don't you?

573
00:54:43,522 --> 00:54:44,565
Yes, I do.

574
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:47,401
Well, then, we'll take a vote.

575
00:54:51,072 --> 00:54:52,741
I'll stand by it.

576
00:54:54,118 --> 00:54:55,536
So will you.

577
00:55:01,376 --> 00:55:03,003
What do you say, Bobby?

578
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:05,381
Let's bury him.

579
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,388
I don't want this gettin' around.

580
00:55:11,847 --> 00:55:12,890
Okay?

581
00:55:15,727 --> 00:55:16,853
Okay?

582
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,691
It's up to you, Ed.

583
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:22,902
It's all up to you, Ed.

584
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,751
Now just think what you're doin', Ed.

585
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,586
For God's sake.

586
00:55:39,254 --> 00:55:40,506
You got a wife.

587
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:42,509
You got a child.

588
00:55:43,426 --> 00:55:45,261
You're not involved in this.

589
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:48,641
Think about your family, Ed.

590
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:52,354
This may be the most important decision
of your whole life, Ed.

591
00:55:52,646 --> 00:55:53,855
Yes!

592
00:55:55,357 --> 00:55:57,944
There's no way we can change this.

593
00:55:59,112 --> 00:56:02,157
There's no way we can change
what happened to Bobby.

594
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,451
We gotta do the right thing.

595
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:06,829
We must live with it for the rest
of our lives.

596
00:56:06,912 --> 00:56:07,914
Right!

597
00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:14,630
I'm with Lewis.

598
00:56:18,969 --> 00:56:21,346
All right, let's get on with it, then.

599
01:00:21,424 --> 01:00:22,925
Lewis. Let's go.

600
01:00:23,885 --> 01:00:25,512
What's the plan, Lewis?

601
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,436
Plan?

602
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:36,025
We just paddle on down to Aintry,
get the cars and go home.

603
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:50,166
Put your jacket on, Drew.

604
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:53,253
Drew!

605
01:00:58,051 --> 01:00:59,928
Put your life jacket on!

606
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:28,379
Drew, paddle! Drew!

607
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,024
Drew?

608
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:49,028
Drew, what's the matter?

609
01:01:50,738 --> 01:01:52,615
Lewis, somethin's wrong. To the side.

610
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:53,951
Something's wrong!

611
01:01:54,076 --> 01:01:55,536
No! Go on!

612
01:01:55,911 --> 01:01:57,538
What is it?

613
01:01:58,497 --> 01:01:59,875
Don't stop, Ed!

614
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,669
- I'm gonna pull in.
- Go! Go!

615
01:02:05,256 --> 01:02:06,883
What happened?

616
01:02:07,008 --> 01:02:08,384
Look out!

617
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:29,344
Where's Drew?

618
01:04:31,138 --> 01:04:32,598
My leg's broke.

619
01:04:35,935 --> 01:04:37,229
Where's Drew?

620
01:04:38,897 --> 01:04:40,524
I'm takin' roll call!

621
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,034
Drew was shot!

622
01:04:51,328 --> 01:04:53,039
Somethin' happened to him.

623
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,458
What?

624
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,670
Drew was shot.

625
01:05:00,256 --> 01:05:01,257
Shot?

626
01:05:16,942 --> 01:05:18,319
Here, here.

627
01:05:20,071 --> 01:05:21,447
Hold him here.

628
01:05:21,573 --> 01:05:23,367
- I got him.
- Hold on!

629
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:30,375
Drew was shot!

630
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,170
Bobby, Drew was shot!

631
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:32,032
He was shot, Bobby!

632
01:06:32,908 --> 01:06:34,535
Drew was shot!

633
01:06:36,913 --> 01:06:38,540
Here's his jacket!

634
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:41,459
He wasn't wearin' it!

635
01:06:49,928 --> 01:06:51,555
Maybe Lewis is right!

636
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:54,600
Of course, he's right. Of course!

637
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:01,358
You mean that other guy shot him?

638
01:07:01,775 --> 01:07:02,861
Did he?

639
01:07:03,111 --> 01:07:04,487
Did you see him?

640
01:07:04,737 --> 01:07:06,281
Drew was shot.

641
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:11,287
Lewis says that other guy...

642
01:07:12,163 --> 01:07:14,749
...that toothless bastard, shot him!

643
01:07:17,419 --> 01:07:19,046
He's right up there!

644
01:07:29,434 --> 01:07:31,394
He's gonna try and kill us, too!

645
01:07:32,312 --> 01:07:33,855
If he killed Drew...

646
01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:36,650
...he's gonna have to kill us!

647
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:45,119
Lewis, I'll tell you what.

648
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:51,710
We'll wait until dark, and we'll put you
in the bottom of the canoe...

649
01:07:52,002 --> 01:07:53,962
...and we'll sneak out of here.

650
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:58,176
- Okay, Ed?
- Bobby, look at those rapids down there!

651
01:07:58,384 --> 01:08:00,428
- Look at those rapids!
- Christ!

652
01:08:02,181 --> 01:08:04,850
We can't move out of here in the dark.

653
01:08:08,897 --> 01:08:10,857
We're not gonna move you, Lewis.

654
01:08:12,193 --> 01:08:14,529
Lewis, we're trapped in this gorge.

655
01:08:20,619 --> 01:08:22,247
What're we gonna do, Lewis?

656
01:08:22,372 --> 01:08:25,625
You're the guy with the answers.
What the hell do we do now?

657
01:08:28,754 --> 01:08:31,757
Now you get to play the game.

658
01:08:34,636 --> 01:08:37,180
You're ruined! Lewis, you're ruined!

659
01:08:47,902 --> 01:08:48,736
Listen.

660
01:08:49,195 --> 01:08:50,822
He's hurt bad, isn't he?

661
01:08:51,781 --> 01:08:53,242
What're we gonna do?

662
01:08:54,994 --> 01:08:57,371
The guy must know exactly where we are.

663
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:02,919
Well, if he knows where we are...

664
01:09:05,214 --> 01:09:07,884
...then we sure as hell know
where he's gonna be.

665
01:09:10,429 --> 01:09:11,680
Right up there.

666
01:10:46,751 --> 01:10:47,836
Christ!

667
01:10:48,754 --> 01:10:50,131
What a view!

668
01:11:16,287 --> 01:11:17,413
Goddamn it!

669
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:20,417
You'll never get out of this gorge alive!

670
01:11:21,168 --> 01:11:22,628
Goddamn it!

671
01:11:31,513 --> 01:11:33,140
Pull yourself together.

672
01:15:25,833 --> 01:15:26,961
Release.

673
01:21:39,696 --> 01:21:41,239
I don't believe it!

674
01:21:41,906 --> 01:21:43,700
You did it, Ed.

675
01:21:45,369 --> 01:21:46,620
You killed him!

676
01:21:47,121 --> 01:21:48,247
Good.

677
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:53,837
Lewis had a bad night.
More than once I thought he'd die.

678
01:22:00,387 --> 01:22:01,930
You did it, Ed. Good.

679
01:22:04,016 --> 01:22:05,560
You sure it's him?

680
01:22:07,604 --> 01:22:09,648
That's the guy with the gun, huh?

681
01:22:10,775 --> 01:22:11,984
I think so.

682
01:22:14,111 --> 01:22:16,239
He wasn't just some guy...

683
01:22:16,948 --> 01:22:19,785
...up there huntin' or something?
- You tell me!

684
01:24:15,381 --> 01:24:16,633
Was he shot?

685
01:24:21,471 --> 01:24:23,933
What about here? What about right there?

686
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,559
Could have been a rock.

687
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,616
What are you gonna do with Drew?

688
01:24:39,284 --> 01:24:42,454
If a bullet made this,
there are people who can tell.

689
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:46,501
Oh, God!

690
01:24:47,502 --> 01:24:48,963
There's no end to it.

691
01:25:32,139 --> 01:25:33,849
I didn't really know him.

692
01:25:37,687 --> 01:25:38,772
Drew was...

693
01:25:39,898 --> 01:25:41,359
...a good husband...

694
01:25:42,485 --> 01:25:44,028
...to his wife Linda.

695
01:25:48,325 --> 01:25:51,162
You're a wonderful father
to your boys, Drew...

696
01:25:53,498 --> 01:25:55,375
...Jimmy and Billy Ray.

697
01:25:57,461 --> 01:25:58,754
And if...

698
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:02,509
...we come through this, I promise...

699
01:26:03,385 --> 01:26:05,178
...to do all I can for 'em.

700
01:26:14,731 --> 01:26:16,358
He was the best of us.

701
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:19,278
Amen.

702
01:27:14,845 --> 01:27:17,222
Christ! Look at that! God help us.

703
01:29:29,546 --> 01:29:32,217
We made it. We made it, Ed.

704
01:29:35,386 --> 01:29:36,764
We made it.

705
01:29:38,557 --> 01:29:40,434
- We're back, Ed!
- Yeah.

706
01:29:43,772 --> 01:29:46,149
- We gotta get Lewis to a doctor.
- Right, Ed.

707
01:29:46,274 --> 01:29:48,069
Gotta get Lewis to a doctor.

708
01:29:51,614 --> 01:29:53,826
We're back! We made it!

709
01:29:54,034 --> 01:29:55,411
Everything happened...

710
01:29:55,536 --> 01:29:57,664
Listen, everything happened right here.

711
01:29:57,747 --> 01:29:59,707
Everything happened right here.

712
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:02,753
Lewis broke his leg in those rapids there.

713
01:30:02,878 --> 01:30:05,548
- And Drew drowned here. In this place.
- No, no, Ed.

714
01:30:05,631 --> 01:30:08,635
- No, nothin' happened here.
- Bobby, listen to me!

715
01:30:08,844 --> 01:30:11,054
We got to stop them from lookin' upriver.

716
01:30:11,138 --> 01:30:14,142
It's important that we get together
on this thing.

717
01:30:14,559 --> 01:30:15,852
You understand?

718
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,274
I understand, Eddie, I understand.

719
01:30:20,524 --> 01:30:23,068
That's right, Lewis. That's our story.

720
01:30:23,193 --> 01:30:24,654
Lewis, we're back.

721
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:32,538
- It's all right.
- Get Lewis to a doctor.

722
01:30:32,997 --> 01:30:34,166
All right, Ed.

723
01:30:36,168 --> 01:30:37,210
All right.

724
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:42,717
We'll find a place to put it.

725
01:30:45,304 --> 01:30:46,764
We're not out of this yet!

726
01:33:23,575 --> 01:33:25,285
They brought the cars.

727
01:33:33,087 --> 01:33:34,880
You come for the cars, sir?

728
01:33:36,423 --> 01:33:37,508
Yes.

729
01:33:41,596 --> 01:33:43,141
Do you have a phone?

730
01:33:43,391 --> 01:33:44,433
Phone?

731
01:33:45,643 --> 01:33:46,727
Telephone?

732
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:48,439
Yes, sir.

733
01:33:52,025 --> 01:33:53,736
You're gonna be all right.

734
01:33:54,446 --> 01:33:56,739
What in the world happened to you guys?

735
01:33:57,449 --> 01:33:58,742
Drew Ballinger.

736
01:34:01,787 --> 01:34:03,247
Did you look for him?

737
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:04,583
A long time.

738
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:06,710
Could you show us where it happened?

739
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:22,312
How'd you manage to shoot yourself
with your own arrow?

740
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,357
Didn't think it could be done.

741
01:34:26,984 --> 01:34:27,985
This is nice.

742
01:34:29,528 --> 01:34:30,781
What's that?

743
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:38,831
Chromium, paper tissues...

744
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,127
...hot water... That's nice.

745
01:34:43,879 --> 01:34:45,506
You fallin' asleep?

746
01:34:46,925 --> 01:34:49,761
Don't forget to phone your wife.
Let her know how you are.

747
01:34:49,886 --> 01:34:52,097
Yes, I will, thank you.

748
01:35:17,711 --> 01:35:19,421
Hello. Come on in.

749
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:26,555
We saved you a seat.

750
01:35:34,398 --> 01:35:36,525
Do you feel like eating something?

751
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:39,237
Please.

752
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:44,410
Some corn?

753
01:36:01,054 --> 01:36:02,764
Would you like some peas?

754
01:36:32,675 --> 01:36:34,552
This corn is special, isn't it?

755
01:36:35,553 --> 01:36:37,181
I love good corn.

756
01:36:38,474 --> 01:36:41,645
We need that cucumber
I got out of the garden last night.

757
01:36:42,813 --> 01:36:44,189
You know how long it was?

758
01:36:44,314 --> 01:36:47,151
- Tell me.
- Twelve-and-a-half inches long.

759
01:36:48,486 --> 01:36:52,449
Then I measured it around,
and it's ten-and-a-half around.

760
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:56,161
That's the darndest lookin' cucumber
you'll ever see.

761
01:36:59,374 --> 01:37:02,962
I tell you, I'll send it over
and let you see it, if you doubt it.

762
01:37:04,547 --> 01:37:06,841
I think you're crazy sometimes.

763
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,724
<i>We can show you the place.</i>

764
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:16,310
<i>Now I know where you told me it was.</i>

765
01:37:19,064 --> 01:37:20,691
<i>We just wanna cooperate.</i>

766
01:37:21,942 --> 01:37:24,612
<i>You recognize that piece of canoe?</i>

767
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:27,740
<i>Now, we lost one. That could be it.</i>

768
01:37:27,866 --> 01:37:28,951
<i>But you ain't sure?</i>

769
01:37:29,034 --> 01:37:31,620
<i>Yeah, I think so, but it's kind of confusing.</i>

770
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:34,124
<i>I'd think you'd recognize your own canoe.</i>

771
01:37:41,257 --> 01:37:44,428
I'd appreciate it if you'd show me
that spot.

772
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:07,788
Ed, we're in trouble. They don't believe us!

773
01:38:11,293 --> 01:38:13,086
What did you tell him, Bobby?

774
01:38:14,505 --> 01:38:16,049
What we agreed on.

775
01:38:17,967 --> 01:38:20,261
I heard you. I was in that room, Bobby.

776
01:38:22,515 --> 01:38:23,974
What did you tell him?

777
01:38:25,976 --> 01:38:28,438
They found part of the green canoe, right?

778
01:38:28,563 --> 01:38:30,440
Upstream, and you got scared.

779
01:38:31,316 --> 01:38:33,277
Didn't you, Bobby? I know you.

780
01:38:34,445 --> 01:38:36,489
You told him the truth, didn't you, Bobby?

781
01:38:36,572 --> 01:38:39,034
- You told him the truth!
- I didn't do that!

782
01:38:44,999 --> 01:38:46,167
I told 'em...

783
01:38:47,419 --> 01:38:48,712
...like we said.

784
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:52,258
But I don't think they believed me.

785
01:38:54,386 --> 01:38:56,847
Ed, I think they found that other canoe...

786
01:38:57,347 --> 01:38:59,851
...upstream, above where we told him.

787
01:39:06,859 --> 01:39:08,236
I never said that.

788
01:39:09,028 --> 01:39:10,405
Yes, you did.

789
01:39:11,865 --> 01:39:14,451
- No, I didn't.
- I know damn well you did.

790
01:39:16,036 --> 01:39:17,163
I know what I said.

791
01:39:17,288 --> 01:39:19,499
Yeah, well, that's a goddamn lie.

792
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:23,003
Sheriff, that ain't what he said
this morning.

793
01:39:23,753 --> 01:39:26,507
You tell me how a canoe can drift upriver.

794
01:39:29,636 --> 01:39:31,096
Now what about this?

795
01:39:33,056 --> 01:39:34,349
Look, Sheriff...

796
01:39:35,101 --> 01:39:37,061
...we been through quite a lot.

797
01:39:37,687 --> 01:39:40,274
I don't know what's wrong
with your man there.

798
01:39:41,525 --> 01:39:43,861
Mr. Queen's got a brother-in-law...

799
01:39:44,905 --> 01:39:46,865
...back up in there somewhere.

800
01:39:47,407 --> 01:39:49,951
He took off huntin' three days ago and...

801
01:39:51,204 --> 01:39:53,497
...nobody's heard from him since.

802
01:39:54,749 --> 01:39:56,960
Mr. Queen thought maybe you all...

803
01:39:57,085 --> 01:39:59,463
...might've happened up on him
somewhere.

804
01:40:00,172 --> 01:40:01,466
Well, we didn't.

805
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,386
Don't let 'em go. These boys is lying.

806
01:40:08,849 --> 01:40:11,144
We got nothin' to hold 'em for.

807
01:40:11,478 --> 01:40:13,021
We don't have a thing.

808
01:40:20,363 --> 01:40:23,992
Let's just wait and see
what comes out of the river.

809
01:40:39,177 --> 01:40:41,221
That there's the town hall.

810
01:40:42,305 --> 01:40:44,684
Right over there's the old fire station.

811
01:40:44,892 --> 01:40:47,645
Played a lot of checkers over there.

812
01:40:49,481 --> 01:40:52,401
All this land's gonna be covered
with water.

813
01:40:52,693 --> 01:40:55,446
Best thing that ever happened
to this town.

814
01:41:04,207 --> 01:41:08,838
We may have to stop just a minute
for the church to get out of the way.

815
01:41:16,972 --> 01:41:18,140
Christ.

816
01:41:32,157 --> 01:41:33,700
Doctor, how's our boy?

817
01:41:33,783 --> 01:41:36,245
We're doin' everything we can for him.

818
01:41:36,329 --> 01:41:39,999
But there's a chance he might lose the leg,
so take it easy on him, okay?

819
01:41:40,124 --> 01:41:41,835
I'll talk with you later.

820
01:41:48,927 --> 01:41:50,011
Officer?

821
01:41:53,098 --> 01:41:54,725
Has he been awake yet?

822
01:41:54,808 --> 01:41:57,562
No, we're still waitin' for him
to come around.

823
01:42:07,407 --> 01:42:09,952
Lewis, listen, we had to change our story.

824
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,717
How you feeling?

825
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:25,387
Never better.

826
01:42:32,353 --> 01:42:33,730
Did you hear me?

827
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:37,192
What happened on that last set of rapids?

828
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:40,446
I don't remember nothing.

829
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:43,909
Nothing.

830
01:42:56,299 --> 01:42:58,593
- Want me to drive Drew's car back?
- No.

831
01:42:58,759 --> 01:43:00,012
Talk to his wife?

832
01:43:00,137 --> 01:43:02,097
I'll do it, Bobby, thank you.

833
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:22,538
You all about ready to leave?

834
01:43:22,622 --> 01:43:23,623
Yeah.

835
01:43:28,212 --> 01:43:32,133
The Griner boys brought these cars
down to you from Orie, is that right?

836
01:43:32,717 --> 01:43:33,718
Right.

837
01:43:37,848 --> 01:43:40,601
You happen to see another man
with 'em up there?

838
01:43:43,939 --> 01:43:45,732
There was someone, wasn't there?

839
01:43:45,857 --> 01:43:47,401
I think so, yes.

840
01:44:01,626 --> 01:44:04,630
Before you go, buddy,
let me ask you something.

841
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:11,346
How come you all ended up
with four life jackets?

842
01:44:12,222 --> 01:44:14,016
Didn't we have an extra one?

843
01:44:16,561 --> 01:44:17,688
No.

844
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:22,109
Drew wasn't wearin' his.

845
01:44:23,736 --> 01:44:26,489
Well, how come he wasn't wearin' it?

846
01:44:31,412 --> 01:44:32,580
I don't know.

847
01:44:42,091 --> 01:44:44,553
Don't ever do nothin' like this again.

848
01:44:48,098 --> 01:44:49,726
Don't come back up here.

849
01:44:50,894 --> 01:44:53,396
You don't have to worry
about that, Sheriff.

850
01:44:56,108 --> 01:44:59,445
I'd kinda like to see this town die peaceful.

851
01:45:02,032 --> 01:45:04,576
I hope Deputy Queen
finds his brother-in-law.

852
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:09,290
He'll come in drunk probably.

853
01:45:51,048 --> 01:45:52,300
Good-bye, Ed.

854
01:45:52,592 --> 01:45:53,802
'Bye, Bobby.

855
01:45:54,386 --> 01:45:56,638
I don't think I'll see you for a while.

856
01:47:18,569 --> 01:47:19,862
Hey, Charlie.

857
01:47:22,157 --> 01:47:23,784
What you got there, guy?

858
01:47:41,972 --> 01:47:43,766
What's the matter?

859
01:47:45,977 --> 01:47:47,436
It's all right.

860
01:47:48,313 --> 01:47:49,606
It's all right.

861
01:47:52,317 --> 01:47:53,444
Go to sleep.

862
01:47:56,322 --> 01:47:57,448
Go to sleep.

863
