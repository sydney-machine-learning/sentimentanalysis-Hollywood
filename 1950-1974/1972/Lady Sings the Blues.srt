1
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,371
<i>All right, Eleanora. </i>

2
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,066
Eleanora.

3
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,613
Miss Holiday.

4
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,843
You better haul
your little black ass in here.

5
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,285
Slow.

6
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,831
It's about time.

7
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:14,573
Girl, if you wants to lay around all day,
you is in the wrong end of the business.

8
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,481
When I give it away for the first time,
it ain't gonna be to no $2 john...

9
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,848
in East Baltimore. That's for damn sure.

10
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,979
At the rate you going, by the time
you decide to give it away...

11
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,820
you'll have to pay some john
$2 just to take it.

12
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,656
I's here, y'all. I got my $2.

13
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,286
That's dynamite.

14
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,032
And I see just the woman I want.

15
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,938
Come here, baby. Come to Papa.

16
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,841
Got a surprise for you.
I got a surprise for you.

17
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,411
I got a surprise for you, too,
if you don't leave me alone.

18
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,638
- Come here, sweetie.
- What?

19
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,112
Come over here.

20
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,309
Let me tell you something. Come on.
Come on. I know. I know. Listen.

21
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,976
I'm trying to talk to this...

22
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:58,786
Now, what do a fine man like you
want with a child like this?

23
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,955
She ain't 15 years old yet.

24
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,925
- What that got to do with anything?
- I know.

25
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,792
I come here to spend my money.

26
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,230
Suppose I take you over here
and show you a real woman...

27
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,928
who could give you your money's worth.

28
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,259
No.

29
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,371
No, that one's
plenty woman enough for me.

30
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,668
Don't try to give me no jive, broad.
I see what I want.

31
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,974
I come here to spend my money.

32
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,413
And I see what I want, and this is it.

33
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,009
- Come on. Come on, now.
- Well, you can't get what you see.

34
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,316
And since you don't want
what you can get...

35
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,620
then you know where you can go,
and this is it.

36
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,254
We don't need his kind, no way.

37
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,627
Imagine him making all that fuss
over one young kid.

38
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:44,833
- He must have been good and drunk.
- Yeah, drunk or blind. Shit.

39
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,599
All right, honey.
You can go now. That's enough.

40
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,833
Honey.

41
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,069
You are wearing this thing out
and me with it.

42
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,640
Now, why don't you take it with you
and make it a good home?

43
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,739
You mean, I can have it?

44
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,252
If you can get out of here with it
before I can count to 10. One...

45
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,847
two, three, four...

46
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:10,656
five, six, seven, eight...

47
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,655
nine, ten.

48
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,643
Eleanora. Eleanora.

49
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,543
The good Lord
give you two long legs to run with...

50
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,172
and He give me two strong hands...

51
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,184
to beat your black behind blue
the next time you slowpoke home...

52
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,847
when you know we got an all-night drive
before we get to Cousin Charlotte's.

53
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,686
- Sorry.
- Now, here.

54
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,658
You take these here keys
and make sure you use them.

55
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:19,162
I don't wanna come back here Sunday
night and find the house all cleaned out.

56
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,359
Talking about cleaning,
you didn't do the steps this week...

57
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,959
and the oven could use
a good scrubbing.

58
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,666
I didn't have time to make the beds,
and there's washing to be put out.

59
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,334
Wave goodbye to your cousin Eleanora.

60
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,811
I'm gonna call Reverend Jones and
make sure you get to church on Sunday.

61
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,215
Now, you be a good girl, Eleanora,
and next time you can come with us.

62
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,756
There's a letter inside
from your mama from New York.

63
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,121
And empty out the pan under the icebox.

64
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,123
<i>Do</i>

65
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,400
<i>Want to anyway</i>

66
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:13,442
<i>I don't care what people say</i>

67
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,518
<i>If I should</i>

68
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,488
<i>Take a notion</i>

69
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,156
<i>To jump into the ocean</i>

70
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,893
<i>Ain't nobody's business</i>

71
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,435
<i>If I do</i>

72
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,264
<i>If I do</i>

73
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,972
<i>If my man ain't</i>

74
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,739
<i>Got no money</i>

75
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,439
<i>And I say take all</i>

76
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,917
I's here. Got my $2.

77
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,419
It's dynamite. That's dynamite.

78
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,120
Come on. Come on.

79
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,525
Don't be afraid of me.

80
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,187
I'm not gonna hurt you.

81
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,094
I'm not scared of you,
'cause you handsome.

82
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,429
- You know what I mean?
- Come on.

83
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,868
- Okay, I...
- Come on. Come on.

84
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,270
Come on, sweetie, sweetie.
Let me take a look at you.

85
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,602
Oh, my goodness.

86
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,610
Why don't you sit down on the...

87
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,441
- Okay.
- Come on.

88
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,313
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Sit down.
Can't do nothing standing up, now.

89
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,818
Come on. Sit down. Okay.

90
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,616
Now take your hat off,
and rest your coat.

91
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,967
Funny girl!
And then the missus woke up...

92
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,232
and saw
that he hadn't come home all night.

93
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,466
And then wouldn't she hit the ceiling!

94
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,702
Went running all over the place...

95
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,245
flopping that old yellow nightgown
of hers, you know...

96
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,713
and looking for him
and calling, "Charles?

97
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,812
"Charlee?"

98
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,114
I sure hope they get
their problems all settled...

99
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,987
before they get back here
in the morning. Uh-oh.

100
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,122
Got my polishing to do. See you, girl.

101
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,076
- This your kid, Sadie?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:28,675
You know she shouldn't be walking
around by herself in this neighborhood.

103
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,079
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,558
Guess you heard about what happened.

105
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,987
I came all the way from Baltimore
to see you, Ma.

106
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,030
My baby.

107
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,699
Thank you, Mama.

108
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,711
Sure is gonna be great
staying together again, ain't it, Ma?

109
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,643
Ain't it, Ma?

110
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,118
Honey, you know there ain't nothing
your mama wouldn't do for you.

111
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,021
Nothing in the world.

112
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,891
You can stay the night, but the madam's
coming home in the morning.

113
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,963
I understand, Mama.

114
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,837
Sister Edson.

115
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,968
I bet you, if I called her and asked her...

116
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:35,604
She's a lady from our church, and she's
always willing to help nice, young girls.

117
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,978
And since you're my daughter...

118
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,015
I bet she'd be willing
to let you do some housework...

119
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,282
for your room and your board.

120
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,520
- I'm sorry, baby.
- It's all right, Mama.

121
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,730
Can't fault you for what ain't your fault.

122
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,336
I'll be all right.

123
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,526
Come in, missy.

124
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,040
Excuse me, miss.
Is you "Miss Lorraine Edson...

125
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,306
290139th Street, Harlem"?

126
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,781
Yes, honey, I sure am.
And you must be Sadie's girl.

127
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,113
Yes, ma'am. I am.

128
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,450
Well, the good Lord's
delivered you safe and sound.

129
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,423
My mama told me to say thank you
for taking me in.

130
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,992
And she told me also to tell you...

131
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,291
that you have
the best rooming house in Harlem...

132
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,694
and that I ain't supposed to be lazy
and I supposed to work real, real hard.

133
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,100
Well, now,
that's a fine spirit you got, honey.

134
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,337
And I want you to
just make yourself right at home.

135
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,500
Okay.

136
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,943
Rest your things. Look around.
I'll be right back.

137
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,710
That's a fine young girl.

138
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,331
Well, now, honey, I'll show you
my whole place, upstairs and down.

139
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,334
I don't want to see the upstairs,
Miss Edson...

140
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,303
'cause my Mama told me
you had a job for me as a cleaner.

141
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,305
And that's what I got, missy.

142
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,638
I mean, you're the one
with other things on your mind.

143
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,441
Wishful thinking, I call it.
'Cause, girl, let's face it...

144
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,615
you got a long way to go...

145
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,880
before you can earn $2
for just 10 minutes of your time...

146
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,949
or ain't you looked at yourself lately?

147
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,344
That lazy bitch.
She don't look where she's going.

148
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,149
Ain't it a shame how some
of God's children have it so easy...

149
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,725
and others have it so hard?

150
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,919
"Ain't it a shame?"

151
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:34,081
<i>Last night, night before
Two different robbers at my door</i>

152
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,251
Come on.

153
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,510
Kid, come on, beat it.

154
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,747
- Mister, is the boss around?
- You're saying goodbye to him. Bye-bye.

155
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,881
Okay, but look,
I work in the neighborhood already...

156
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,824
and I'd be willing to quit working
and come up here and work for you.

157
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,122
Yeah, I'd be very happy to quit, too.
Come on, honey.

158
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,697
- But I can sing. I really can.
- Yeah.

159
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,256
I can dance, and I know the words
to every song that's out today.

160
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,302
I mean, I've been really rehearsing
and everything.

161
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,268
That's very good. So do I.
But I tell you...

162
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,569
in order to be a showgirl,
you gotta have something to show.

163
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,142
Well, I got something. I really do.

164
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,838
All you have to do is push it up a bit
and put some lip rouge on.

165
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,380
I could do it, mister, give me a break.
Look, really, I'm good.

166
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,780
- All you have to do is give me a chance.
- Listen, girlie.

167
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,184
Listen to me. I don't wanna hurt
your feelings, but no amount of slinky...

168
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,019
and makeup is gonna change you
into a female that looks...

169
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,192
like that.

170
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,454
Louis, so good to see you.

171
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,932
I'll get you a great table. How about
a nice table for Mr. McKay?

172
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,992
What you looking at?
Don't your mama make you wash steps?

173
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,498
<i>Shake it to the east
Shake it to the west</i>

174
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,269
<i>Shake it to the one
that you love the best</i>

175
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,910
- Now?
- No, not yet, don't you peek, Mama.

176
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,915
- Now?
- Not yet.

177
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,789
- Now?
- No.

178
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,521
Now come with me.

179
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,334
Surprise.

180
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,804
Jesus. Lord have mercy.

181
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,174
I ain't never,
in my whole life, seen such a fine hat.

182
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,571
Just like them fancy ladies
up on Sugar Hill.

183
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,610
Oh, Lord, and just to think
my baby give it to me.

184
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,488
Honey, I just loves it.

185
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,392
God bless Sister Edson.

186
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,864
I can see she's doing right by you.
Every time you come over here...

187
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,129
you're looking better and better. Still
cleaning and washing, no cooking yet?

188
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,033
No, not yet.

189
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,864
Hey, Mama, I gotta go. It's getting late.
I don't wanna miss my train.

190
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,672
Honey, I forgot.
I got a surprise for you, too.

191
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,478
I got me a new job starting next week,
and it's gonna be close by you...

192
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,519
and I'll be able to walk over
most evenings, won't that be nice?

193
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,144
And we can visit.

194
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,883
That'll be swell, Mama.
That'll be just swell.

195
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,459
- Just what we always wanted.
- Yeah.

196
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,758
We'll be able to
spend more time together.

197
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,996
That'll be real great.

198
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,895
Lord have mercy. My baby done
made me so happy this day.

199
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,685
Eleanora, you're late again. Girl,
you done missed two tricks already.

200
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:19,127
You better get the spirit, sister,
and get yourself on up them steps...

201
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,028
and quit your lollygagging.

202
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,727
Didn't you mama teach you
how to close doors?

203
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,827
If you don't want this job,
somebody else sure do.

204
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,919
You fine, young thing.

205
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,826
You're new in the neighborhood.

206
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,923
So, honey, I gotta love you real good.

207
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,735
Looky here
what Lorraine done sent to me.

208
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,899
I never accomplished any great feats...

209
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,999
but you know something, baby?

210
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,704
I'm something else under them sheets.

211
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,249
You see my father was a jockey,
and he taught me how to ride.

212
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,844
He said, Big Ben, you got to get it
from side to side.

213
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,249
Now, in case you don't know who I am...

214
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,190
I'm Big Ben, baby. Yeah, the lover-man.

215
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,223
We gonna have ourselves a ball tonight.

216
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,996
Lorraine done sent me this fine dinner.

217
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,804
Young and tender.
This is where her head was.

218
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,910
Won't be there when I get through.

219
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,511
'Cause, see, I'm from the city,
and I'm gonna kiss your little titty.

220
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,016
Young, and fine, and mellow.

221
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,490
Light as a feather.

222
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,185
<i>Big Ben told all his men
Don't you take no numbers</i>

223
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,262
<i>After half past ten</i>

224
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,888
What? What's the matter
with you, woman?

225
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,399
Ain't nothing personal, mister,
but I just quit the business.

226
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:42,534
Hell, bitch, you crazy?
Ain't this a killer?

227
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,733
Lorraine.

228
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,673
Hey, Lorraine. Lorraine.

229
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,177
What's happening?
Who's making all that noise up there?

230
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,339
- He said his name is Big Ben.
- Big Ben?

231
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,575
Ain't you supposed to be upstairs
with Big Ben?

232
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,346
- I ain't doing it.
- What you mean you ain't doing it, girl?

233
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,547
You give my place a bad name.
Big Ben's the best customer I got.

234
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,251
You can't do that.
All the girls love Big Ben.

235
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,351
He's my best customer, and I'm trying
to make something out of you.

236
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,158
I sent him up to you.
Now, what's the matter with you, girl?

237
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,723
You better get the spirit, sister, and
get on back upstairs and do your work.

238
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:14,236
- The Lord knows I'm trying to help you...
- Miss Edson, honey, I done quit.

239
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,636
Done quit?

240
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,940
Well, you get on away from around
here, then. 'Cause you ain't nothing.

241
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,842
You ain't never been nothing,
and you ain't gonna be nothing.

242
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,007
'Cause you don't go messing like that
with Big Ben.

243
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,608
- That's right.
- Get your ass back in the house.

244
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,185
- You looking for someone, Miss?
- Yes.

245
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,458
I noticed your sign in the window...

246
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,932
and I'm a featured dancer
at a club downtown.

247
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,904
And I don't have much time,
but I happen to live in the neighborhood.

248
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,999
And I'm looking
for something a little closer to home.

249
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,376
So you're a dancer now?

250
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,544
Okay, dancer. Dance.

251
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,869
Yeah, that's fine, girls. Take 10.

252
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,669
Thank you, honey. Just real nice.
Beautiful. Wonderful.

253
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,833
I tell you what,
watch your step as you leave.

254
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,877
You know the way out. Be careful.

255
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,570
Hey, baby, you know how to sing?

256
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,841
Yeah, I know how to sing,
but he wants a dancer.

257
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:41,043
You ain't got nothing to lose.
You better try to think up a song.

258
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,882
- I can sing anything. Shoot.
- All right, let's try something.

259
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,615
- What you know?
- But he doesn't like me.

260
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,352
He ain't got nothing to do. I can
handle him. What can you sing?

261
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,190
<i>- I can sing All of Me. 
- Jerry, I'm sorry, brother. Just go on.</i>

262
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,628
<i>All of Me, man,
you ain't never heard this like this.</i>

263
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,131
<i>- All Of Me. 
- Church, take you home.</i>

264
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,894
This a friend of mine, man, I didn't...

265
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,697
You gonna love it. Jerry,
you're a good person in your heart.

266
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:03,399
- You know you're gonna love it.
- Okay, okay, let her sing. Sing.

267
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,538
<i>All of me</i>

268
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,305
Ain't Miss Holiday something?

269
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,981
<i>All of me</i>

270
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,989
<i>Why not take all of me</i>

271
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,832
<i>Can't you see</i>

272
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,401
<i>I'm no good without you</i>

273
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,165
<i>Take my lips</i>

274
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:41,210
<i>I want to lose them</i>

275
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,014
<i>Take my arms</i>

276
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,843
<i>I'll never use them</i>

277
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,454
<i>Your goodbye</i>

278
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,820
<i>Left me with eyes that cry</i>

279
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,995
<i>How can I
Go on without you</i>

280
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,295
<i>You took the part</i>

281
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,633
<i>That once was my heart</i>

282
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:12,073
<i>So why not
Take all of me</i>

283
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:14,906
<i>Yeah</i>

284
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,176
<i>Take all of me</i>

285
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,420
Come on, you girls, come on,
you gotta get dressed.

286
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,118
We open in 15 minutes. And you...

287
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,391
Tonight, you get your chance.

288
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,760
Wait a minute.
What'd you say your name was?

289
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,924
- Eleanora.
- Ella... Ella who?

290
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,667
Billie. Billie Holiday.
Billie Holiday, that's my name.

291
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,765
Okay, Billie. One of the girls
will show you where you put your things.

292
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,970
Tonight, all you gotta do is watch
the other singers and do what they do.

293
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,341
Okay, you're an angel, Jerry.

294
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:53,645
Yeah, wait a minute. I'll be a bum
if you don't pull in $15 in tips tonight.

295
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,686
$15. Now, that's my definition
of a good singer.

296
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,880
Okay.

297
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,254
Go on, Billie Holiday.

298
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,010
What you frowning about, baby?

299
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,375
Don't worry about it.
What she miss on the top...

300
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,380
she can pick up on the bottom.

301
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,746
I hope that works both ways.

302
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,287
Don't worry about it.
One day, she picked the table up.

303
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,762
All right, Mama, go ahead.

304
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:16,561
Next time, you could pick up the floor.
We don't need a janitor.

305
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,033
Go on. Go on. Jerry's watching.
Right there, Jack.

306
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,833
Come on, baby.

307
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,431
That's a new girl just breaking in.

308
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,419
<i>Some day he'll come along</i>

309
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,651
Yes, sir.

310
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,122
<i>The man I love</i>

311
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,531
<i>And he'll be big and strong</i>

312
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,600
Pick it up.

313
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,498
<i>The man I love</i>

314
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,035
Pick it up. Come over. Come on.

315
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,901
<i>And when he comes my way</i>

316
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:02,007
<i>I'll do my best to make him stay</i>

317
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,407
You're pitiful.

318
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,976
<i>He'll look at me and smile</i>

319
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,651
<i>I'll understand</i>

320
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,687
Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.

321
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:20,230
<i>Then in a little while
He'll take my hand</i>

322
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,127
<i>And though it seems absurd</i>

323
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,327
- Come on. Come on.
- Pick it up.

324
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,602
You think you're too good
to pick up money?

325
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:32,198
- Want me to put my foot in your ass?
- Would you shut up?

326
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:37,346
<i>Maybe he'll come Sunday</i>

327
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,544
<i>Maybe Monday</i>

328
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,552
You gotta do better than that, hon.

329
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,951
<i>Maybe not</i>

330
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,421
Go. Get it. Get it.

331
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:51,756
<i>Still I'm sure he'll come one day</i>

332
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:56,060
<i>Maybe Tuesday</i>

333
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,694
<i>Will be my good news day</i>

334
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,467
<i>He'll build a little home</i>

335
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,004
<i>Just meant for two</i>

336
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,979
<i>From which I'll never roam</i>

337
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,915
Take the money. Come on,
I can do better than that myself.

338
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,383
<i>And so all else above</i>

339
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,748
Go ahead, pick it on up.

340
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,518
<i>I'm dreaming of</i>

341
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,988
<i>The man I love</i>

342
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,710
Schmuck. Me and my big heart,
and you and your friends.

343
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,111
- Who does she think she is?
- A lady. With a hell of a voice.

344
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,445
We ain't gonna end up
with a quarter tonight.

345
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,178
Shit, you ain't paid me in two weeks...

346
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,254
what you bullshitting about a quarter?

347
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,193
Billie, Billie, go get it. Get the money.

348
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,799
Go on. Get it.

349
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,409
Do you want my arm to fall off?

350
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,063
Take it. Take the money. Take it, Billie.

351
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,705
<i>I fell in love with you
The first time I looked into</i>

352
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,215
<i>Them there eyes</i>

353
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,718
<i>'Cause you have a certain little
Cute way of flirting</i>

354
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,755
<i>With them there eyes</i>

355
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,552
<i>They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue</i>

356
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,754
Take it.

357
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,589
<i>I'm falling
No stalling</i>

358
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,599
- Here's some money.
- Work it out, baby.

359
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,638
<i>My heart is jumping
You've started something</i>

360
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,105
<i>With them there eyes</i>

361
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:23,246
<i>You'd better look out, little brown eyes
If you're wise</i>

362
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,281
Sing like a lady. Come on, lady.

363
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,645
<i>They bubble</i>

364
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,686
<i>Gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble</i>

365
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,017
<i>Ooh, baby</i>

366
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,557
<i>Them there eyes</i>

367
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,889
<i>Them there eyes</i>

368
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,502
Here's your cut, Billie.
I like you. I think you're gonna make it.

369
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:48,934
Here's your cut, Billie.
I like you. I think you're gonna make it.

370
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,304
Thanks, Jerry. I like you, too.

371
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,802
Say, baby, that's beautiful.

372
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:56,971
Here, take some.

373
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,311
Get out. Come on,
you were beautiful tonight.

374
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,248
I just wanna tell you thank you.

375
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,149
I love you.
You were beautiful. Just pretty.

376
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,484
Thank you.
I really was scared, I'll tell you that.

377
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,081
You should have been scared.
Them niggers is dangerous.

378
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,160
- Billie.
- What you doing?

379
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,028
- Billie.
- Yeah? Yeah, Jerry.

380
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,565
These are for you.
There's a car waiting for you upstairs.

381
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,861
- Thanks, Jerry.
- Here's your money, Yvonne.

382
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,164
A car waiting for me upstairs.

383
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,800
Don't flash them moon eyes at me.
I didn't send you nothing.

384
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,400
There was never a doubt in my mind.

385
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,139
Besides, there's a card,
and you probably can't even write.

386
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,684
Don't have to know how to read, neither,
to know what that card's saying.

387
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,082
If he spent as much time
running his numbers...

388
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,315
as he does them damn gardenias,
he could have one hell of a business.

389
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,260
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?
Well, what do you know?

390
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,727
You got a great thing going in here.

391
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,799
Leave that nigger alone.
He is dangerous. You understand?

392
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:52,299
He pulls that bit on everybody,
got a room full of girls at home.

393
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:56,533
You just gonna be another one. You
wanna be that? You got too much going.

394
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,802
This is one face
that won't get that hungry.

395
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,207
I don't stand in no line for nobody.

396
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,370
All right.

397
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,244
Not even Mr. Louis McKay.

398
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,677
Jerry?

399
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,951
- Tell him the answer is no.
- No?

400
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,082
No.

401
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,990
That'll show him, 'cause he usually gets
everyone he wants.

402
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,001
He can get this one, too,
but not on the first night.

403
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,574
Good night, lady.

404
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,805
- Good night, Billie.
- Good night, Jerry.

405
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,249
What's the matter?
You don't like gardenias?

406
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,752
They're okay.

407
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,144
So?

408
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,957
So you don't put them on
just to go to someone's apartment...

409
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,994
for a late-night supper.

410
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,493
- So that's how it is?
- That's how it is.

411
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,602
Pardon me, lady, I must have
got you mixed up with someone...

412
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,868
who used to reside at Missus...
What's her name?

413
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,900
If that's what you thought, nigger,
why'd you give me them damn flowers?

414
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,946
Why didn't you
just give me some money?

415
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:15,911
I did.

416
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:24,956
Hey, Billie. Listen, listen, all right?

417
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,223
You don't mind
if I call you Billie, do you?

418
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,923
- Don't call me nothing.
- No, listen.

419
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,524
Listen, I know a place downtown.
It's open all night.

420
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,729
A fantastic place. You can eat.
You can have food. You can dance.

421
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,602
You can do anything you want.
Now, come on.

422
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,299
Just like the late-night-supper stuff?

423
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,207
No, no, this is for real, baby.
Listen, there's my car right there.

424
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,873
We can go on right down there
right now. Listen, I like you.

425
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,609
I wouldn't do anything to harm you.

426
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,208
- I'm so thrilled.
- Really, seriously.

427
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,347
Please, Billie.

428
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,722
- Please? Pretty please?
- Pretty please.

429
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,325
All right?

430
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:04,528
Come on. You look so pretty.

431
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,373
What's been going on?

432
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,546
Good evening.

433
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,911
Mr. McKay, it's nice to see you again.

434
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,382
<i>Paul, come stai?</i>

435
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,419
<i>- Bene. Bene.  How are you?
- Good.</i>

436
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,046
Gosh, you stayed away a long time.

437
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:25,580
<i>A sound</i>

438
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:29,845
<i>Until that day
You came my way</i>

439
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,582
<i>With pleasure I never found</i>

440
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,181
<i>It all might have been</i>

441
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,625
<i>Had you been around</i>

442
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,432
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

443
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:50,303
Fantastic. Fantastic. Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen. Thank you, Janie.

444
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,467
She gets better-looking every day,
doesn't she, guys?

445
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:56,444
Well, how do you like this place?
Isn't this something?

446
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,176
I wanted to bring you here because
I thought you'd really enjoy yourself.

447
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:04,277
It ain't so hot. I been
to a whole lot of places like this before.

448
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,324
Is that so? Right. Well, where?

449
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,732
Huh?

450
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:19,931
- Where?
- Where what?

451
00:42:19,966 --> 00:42:21,193
- Where?
- Where what?

452
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,832
You said you've been
to a lot of places like this before.

453
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,674
- Where?
- Did I say that?

454
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,740
I heard you say that.
Maybe I misunderstood what you said.

455
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,209
What do you think you said?

456
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,587
I said, you ain't so hot.

457
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:40,624
Well...

458
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,118
I...

459
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,856
I just love the way you talk,
you know what I mean?

460
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,488
Well, you make me...

461
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,228
You know... I've never met
nobody like you before, you know?

462
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,201
You kind of make me speechless.

463
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,330
- Do, I really? I mean, really?
- I mean, yeah.

464
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,408
Right. I don't know
what to do with myself, you see.

465
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:02,206
I don't even know what to do with
my hands and everything, you know?

466
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,111
You sure have pretty teeth
when you smile.

467
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,808
Okay.

468
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,147
And that, you know...

469
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,891
That dress.
I want to tell you about that dress.

470
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,392
That dress brings out
the best tones in your skin.

471
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,031
Do you feel like dancing?

472
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:32,739
I don't know.

473
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,139
Well, I feel like dancing.

474
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:39,316
Go on and dance, then.
Ain't nobody stopping you.

475
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,147
You mean,
you want me to dance by myself?

476
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:46,414
Okay.

477
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,691
Thank you. I really appreciate that.

478
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:53,388
Yeah, you really a nice lady, you know?
Come on, now.

479
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,071
Mr. McKay...

480
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,804
I have a confession to make.

481
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,079
What's that?

482
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,517
This place is fantastic...

483
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,077
and so are you.

484
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,055
Yeah.

485
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,391
<i>- What are you doing?
- Nothing. </i>

486
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,726
<i>Can't you do it sleeping?</i>

487
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,640
I really can't believe
I'm here with you, you know that?

488
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,404
If you don't go to sleep, you won't be.

489
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,815
That's what I get
for breaking a house rule.

490
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,717
I like to have breakfast alone,
you know what I mean?

491
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,667
What are you doing, woman?

492
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,013
You want me to leave, don't you?

493
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,551
Look, when I want you to leave,
I'll let you know, okay?

494
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:27,624
Okay.

495
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,383
Okay.

496
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,497
Just so you don't get any big idea,
you understand?

497
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,168
- We'll take this a day at a time.
- Okay.

498
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,005
All right.

499
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,739
Anything you say.

500
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,479
Louis?

501
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,652
Now what?

502
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,088
How do you like your eggs?

503
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,030
<i>I want a pig foot</i>

504
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,102
<i>And a bottle of beer</i>

505
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,750
Is she great? Is she beautiful?

506
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,955
Okay. Okay, folks,
we got a little celebration.

507
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,696
Our lady...

508
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,963
herself, Miss Billie...

509
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,833
appearing in this nightclub for one year.

510
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:28,608
And in honor of the occasion...
Bring that in, and be careful with it.

511
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,075
Everybody gets a piece.

512
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,615
I mean a hunk. A hunk of the cake.

513
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,149
Courtesy of the house. Yeah.

514
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,319
And everybody's gonna get
a glass of champagne...

515
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:43,120
courtesy of Mr. McKay over there.

516
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,465
Okay. Hey, Mr. Piano Man.

517
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,727
Come here.
You're the guy who discovered her.

518
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,427
How about you propose the toast?

519
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,471
Hey, I'm for that. Hey, Billie.

520
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,302
We got Old Cheapie
to spring for something.

521
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,175
You're beautiful, Jer. Damn, Jer!

522
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,241
Damn, but everything's beautiful.

523
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,612
He even paid the band, Billie,
since you been here.

524
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,686
Beautiful year. And everybody... Girls.
Look at the uniforms!

525
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,653
All right.
Look, even the hoes is making money.

526
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,949
That's only because
you're our biggest trick.

527
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,627
Anyway, Billie, we love you sincerely,
very much, in our hearts.

528
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,065
We sure do.

529
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,769
- You gonna play, Piano Man?
- Yeah.

530
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,340
Key a bar. Okay.

531
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,967
Break it.

532
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,237
<i>For she's a jolly good lady</i>

533
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,575
<i>For she's a jolly good lady</i>

534
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:41,117
<i>For she's a jolly good lady</i>

535
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,319
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

536
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,158
Hey, Billie, I want you to meet
two friends of mine.

537
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,322
- This is Harry and Reg. Come on in.
- Yeah.

538
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,525
Come on in. There she is.

539
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,728
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi.

540
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,770
- Hi, Reg. How are you?
- Really nice to meet you.

541
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:05,308
I hate to interrupt you. I know you're all
celebrating and everything...

542
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,004
but I just sure appreciate meeting you.

543
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,775
My name is Harry Bradford.
That is, if you didn't get it.

544
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,613
- Over there, this is Reg Hanley.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

545
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,549
- Louis McKay.
- We...

546
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,316
We're just fans of yours.

547
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,255
And I need all the fans I can get.

548
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,486
Pull up a couple of chairs, fellows,
and join us.

549
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:25,720
Thank you.

550
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,631
Where do you fellows play?

551
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,567
Well, actually,
we're playing no place right now.

552
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,128
Fact is, we're trying to form a band
to take a tour around the country...

553
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,765
and we wanted to talk to you
about joining us.

554
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,366
Joining you? You serious?

555
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,672
Very.

556
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,480
A colored singer with a white band?

557
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,745
Yeah. Yeah.

558
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,145
Yeah?

559
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,186
You must want to keep playing no place.

560
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,260
Well, you see, that's exactly the point.

561
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:00,353
We wouldn't be just another band
with you singing.

562
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,763
We'd be something special
because, well, you're special, Billie.

563
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,334
Here.

564
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,394
There you go.

565
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,364
Thank you.

566
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,374
We'd go straight to the top. I know.

567
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,341
I don't know about no straight to the top.

568
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,105
I'm just trying to get to a club downtown.

569
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,237
We all are.

570
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,441
Of course, you don't understand, see,
the way you get downtown is...

571
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,542
I mean, you know, the way you do that
is that you go out on the road...

572
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,087
and you build up your name
in the sticks, and then, blam!

573
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,317
You get snapped up by network radio,
who're always looking...

574
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:33,863
for someone big with the hicks
to sell them soap or something.

575
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,625
Yeah, then you come back
to New York...

576
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:38,257
and besides radio,
there's records, club dates downtown...

577
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,201
- you name it, Billie.
- Just like that, huh?

578
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,568
Well, it works that way sometimes.

579
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:47,370
You mean to tell me that I have to travel
all the way to East Jesus and back...

580
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:51,504
before I can get in some club downtown
less than five minutes away from here?

581
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,640
- Well...
- They full of shit, ain't they?

582
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:02,584
I just think it'd be fantastic
if you just came with us.

583
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:06,361
- How about that?
- I'm sorry, fellows.

584
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:07,861
I think your band
is gonna have to start without me.

585
00:51:07,896 --> 00:51:09,259
I think your band
is gonna have to start without me.

586
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,994
<i>I'll tell you what. 
Piano Man's got my telephone number. </i>

587
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,367
<i>If you give it some second thoughts,
give us a call. </i>

588
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,539
How you like my timestep, Reg?

589
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,635
I think we might have a part for you,
Miss Holiday...

590
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,373
but we'll have to see your legs.

591
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,718
You know the last time
I saw fields and farm animals...

592
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,656
I was hitching up north from Baltimore
to see my mama.

593
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,490
Leader, I am trying to follow a rule
called "food three times a day"...

594
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,995
but I sense we are dangerously behind.

595
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,588
Let me explain to you.

596
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,793
This is only Tuesday,
and I only feed on Friday.

597
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,067
Stop complaining, Oklahoma.

598
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,297
That's a horrible-looking thing.

599
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,603
You mean we have all this fun,
and we still get paid?

600
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:55,473
Well, about $12 a week,
to do with what you will.

601
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,740
$14? Would you take $8?

602
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,509
Fantastic. I'll take
whatever you give me.

603
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,016
I get the chance to travel.
I get a chance to do everything.

604
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,020
I sense we're in for a lot
of candy stores and a lot of jelly beans.

605
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,420
Can you imagine
someone liking to tour?

606
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,355
Yes, some fun, Billie.

607
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:10,805
Miss Holiday...

608
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,518
Miss Holiday...

609
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,391
you're in the South now.

610
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,765
Jesus, look at this.

611
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,168
You got a half an hour, that's all.
Billie, let me help you out of there.

612
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,001
- A whole half-hour?
- Let me help you out.

613
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,631
Half an hour's all we got.

614
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,441
- Put your shoes on, man.
- Get on out here.

615
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,907
Billie, what'll it be? What do you want?

616
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:35,610
What do I want? What do I really want?

617
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,118
What do you really want?

618
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,551
Well, I'll tell you.

619
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,619
- What?
- I really want...

620
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,517
a steak smothered in onions.

621
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,097
And I really want
a big pot of collard greens.

622
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,222
Right.

623
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,027
- And I want some yams.
- Right.

624
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,329
- I want some black-eyed peas and rice.
- Right.

625
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,563
And I want...

626
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,202
potato pie.

627
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,140
One hot dog, coming up.

628
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,902
- Mustard?
- Oh, crap.

629
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,118
- Hey, Reg...
- Hello, I'm from the Board of Health.

630
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,122
Billie, you ain't missing a thing.

631
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:27,030
<i>I cried for you</i>

632
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,566
<i>What a fool I used to be</i>

633
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,307
<i>Now I found two eyes</i>

634
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,577
<i>Just a little bit bluer</i>

635
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,914
<i>I found a heart</i>

636
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,011
<i>Just a little bit truer</i>

637
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,057
<i>And I cried for you</i>

638
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:56,394
<i>Now it's your turn
To cry over me</i>

639
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,168
Still think it's fun, Billie?

640
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,672
Watch it, will you?

641
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,644
<i>Sorry to say it's that time again. </i>

642
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:15,343
<i>This has been the Oasis Cosmetics
Hour from New York, New York... </i>

643
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,250
<i>featuring the new mellow sounds
of our Sweet Sam... </i>

644
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:19,913
<i>and His Society Swingers. </i>

645
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,082
<i>- So until tomorrow night... 
- Man, did you hear that?</i>

646
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,853
- Here we go again.
- Did you hear that?

647
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,485
- Yeah.
- Sweet Sam and His Society Sissies.

648
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,156
That's supposed to be us, man.
That should be our gig.

649
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,597
Do you want to be a sissy?

650
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,227
Man, here we are, riding our asses off
all over this cotton-picking country...

651
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,500
trying to win these hicks over,
and what do we got to show for it?

652
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,075
Zero. Nothing, man. Bullshit.

653
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:43,805
Where is that big radio cat
that's supposed to discover us, Reg?

654
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,608
Where is that son of a bitch, anyway?

655
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:48,343
Watch your mouth.
Can't you see there's a lady present?

656
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,318
That's right.
Show some respect, you motherfucker.

657
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,649
Billie.

658
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,757
Who is it?

659
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,322
It's Harry.

660
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:02,960
What do you want?

661
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,465
Can I come in?

662
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:05,761
Come on.

663
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:12,240
Gonna be a rehearsal downstairs
in 10 minutes.

664
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,969
Oh, boy.

665
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,472
We got a full day off next week.

666
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,343
I'll be dead by next week.

667
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,995
I'm taking the night off.

668
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,625
You take tonight off...

669
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:42,734
and, sure as hell, that'll be the night...

670
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:49,273
that Mr. Network Radio Scout
is sitting out front and all the things...

671
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:53,944
I mean, everything that we've been
doing goes right down the drain...

672
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,851
because, let's face it, Billie,
you are the cream in our coffee.

673
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,617
You got that the wrong way around,
don't you?

674
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,592
We are just another band without you.

675
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:07,823
Okay.

676
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:12,063
Give me a shot of that bourbon
in my bag, will you?

677
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,637
Well, how about a real...

678
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:21,008
A real what?

679
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:25,112
One shot and you'll...

680
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,147
be flying.

681
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:31,110
Look, Harry, like I've been telling you...

682
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,249
what you do is your business.

683
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,790
I may be tired, but I ain't dumb.

684
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,350
You're walking across a street. A truck
hits you. You're laying in the street.

685
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,363
They take you to the nearest hospital.
What's the first thing they do?

686
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:46,401
They give you a shot of morphine.
Now, morphine ain't an aspirin.

687
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,971
It's dope.

688
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,533
Do you think that makes you an addict?

689
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:57,278
One goddamn little shot ain't gonna...

690
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:01,809
make you a junkie,
but, you know, it keeps you flying.

691
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,410
Okay, Harry.
If I get hit by a truck, I'll call you, okay?

692
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,584
Now get out of here.

693
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,702
Reg, how much longer
before we get to the next town...

694
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,902
- or a gas station or something?
- Well, from the looks of things...

695
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,174
it's gonna be back roads
and cow pastures for quite a while yet.

696
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,442
Pull over to a clump of bushes
or something then?

697
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,915
- No.
- A hedge?

698
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,781
- Come on, please.
- All right.

699
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,753
You have but to ask, madam,
this vehicle is at your disposal.

700
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:42,120
- How about the lake?
- Come on.

701
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,522
All right.

702
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,594
You should take a look at it out here.

703
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:53,226
It's beautiful. Look at those trees.

704
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:04,171
Hey, Billie. Where you going?
You forgot the sheet music.

705
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,043
Just turn your head.

706
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,776
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

707
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,665
Come on, Billie.

708
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,707
Let's go. All aboard.

709
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:52,380
<i>Southern trees</i>

710
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:59,827
<i>Bear a strange fruit</i>

711
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:08,069
<i>Blood on the leaves</i>

712
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:13,972
<i>And blood at the root</i>

713
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:21,783
<i>Here is a fruit</i>

714
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:27,218
<i>For the crows to pluck</i>

715
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:34,058
<i>For the rain to gather</i>

716
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:40,095
<i>For the wind to suck</i>

717
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:51,106
<i>For the sun to rot</i>

718
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,575
<i>For the tree</i>

719
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:03,091
<i>To drop</i>

720
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:11,866
<i>Here is a strange</i>

721
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,228
<i>And bitter</i>

722
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:23,945
<i>Crop</i>

723
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:39,122
<i>Now we're proud to present our
feature vocalist, Miss Billie Holiday. </i>

724
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,533
<i>You're mean to me</i>

725
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:49,503
<i>Why must you be mean to me</i>

726
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,438
<i>Gee, honey, it seems to me</i>

727
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,238
<i>You love to see me crying</i>

728
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,574
<i>I don't know why</i>

729
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,615
<i>I stay home
Each night when you</i>

730
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:07,051
<i>Left all alone
Singing the blues and crying</i>

731
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:12,760
<i>You treat me coldly
Each day in the year</i>

732
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:17,228
<i>You always scold me</i>

733
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:22,604
<i>Whenever you're mean to... </i>

734
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,976
<i>Ladies and gentlemen... </i>

735
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,681
<i>Miss Holiday has been experiencing
some dizzy spells. </i>

736
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,486
<i>I'm sure she'll be back with us
in just a little while. </i>

737
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,061
<i>We will continue
with an instrumental right now... </i>

738
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:48,653
<i>and I'm sure she'll be all right. 
Thank you very much. </i>

739
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,993
<i>Thank you. </i>

740
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:56,471
<i>But if you treat me right, Daddy</i>

741
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,503
<i>I'll stay home every day</i>

742
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:08,217
<i>If you treat me right, Daddy</i>

743
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:13,316
<i>I'll stay home every day</i>

744
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,556
<i>But you're so mean to me, baby</i>

745
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:23,928
<i>I know you're gonna drive me away</i>

746
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,835
<i>Love is just like a faucet</i>

747
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,768
<i>It turns off and on</i>

748
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:41,147
<i>Love is just like a faucet</i>

749
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:46,179
<i>It turns off and on</i>

750
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:51,157
<i>Sometimes when you think it's on, baby</i>

751
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:55,288
<i>It has turned off and gone</i>

752
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:02,435
<i>How about singing
that Old Black Joe there, Billie.</i>

753
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,233
Come on, now. Don't go.

754
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,103
<i>Sing Old Black Joe. </i>

755
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,071
<i>Thank you. Thank you very much. </i>

756
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,203
<i>Thank you. </i>

757
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:15,341
<i>You know that ditty Old Black Joe,
don't you, honey, baby?</i>

758
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:19,512
<i>Now, I'd love to do them all for you. 
I'd love to do it for you... </i>

759
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:21,590
<i>but we got something planned here. </i>

760
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:25,422
<i>A little number called
What a Little Moonlight Can Do.</i>

761
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:11,068
<i>You only shudder
'Cause your poor tongue</i>

762
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,377
<i>Just won't utter
The words</i>

763
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,845
<i>I love you</i>

764
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,781
<i>Miss Billie Holiday. 
Let's give her another hand. </i>

765
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,548
Hey, baby.

766
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:33,758
Baby, what you doing here?

767
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,166
Here, I've been trying
to get you on the phone. Oh, baby.

768
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,735
I missed you so much.

769
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,498
You look so good, baby.

770
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,299
How'd you get here?

771
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,173
Get your clothes off.

772
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,514
I like your style,
but I can't say much for your timing.

773
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,177
Why don't we wait till we get home,
get a nice hot bath?

774
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,275
No.

775
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,185
Whatever you say.
My, my, the man is ready.

776
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,023
Well, so am I.

777
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,795
We've been having a rough tour.

778
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:18,267
Baby, I'm so happy you're here.

779
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:22,903
Now, this is all I'm gonna do.

780
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,071
And I want you to do the rest.

781
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,048
You're hurting me.

782
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:30,878
Jesus.

783
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,754
All right, that's it. Come on, let's go.

784
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,518
- I know what you're thinking.
- This tour's over.

785
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,093
I'm the one who sent you here,
and I'm taking you back home...

786
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:40,162
so get your things, let's go.

787
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,729
Wait a minute.
I know what you're thinking.

788
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,230
I don't wanna hear about it.
Just come home.

789
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,560
I'm not hooked.

790
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,063
No, I ain't going.

791
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,939
I ain't going, Louis.

792
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:02,082
Billie, listen to me.

793
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:06,745
All right.

794
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:13,562
Billie, it...

795
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,794
Believe me when I tell you
that this is for your own good.

796
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:20,630
Don't preach to me, Louis.

797
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:23,967
All that I plan for you
is done with you in mind.

798
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,940
You affect my whole life, baby.
I love you.

799
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,503
- Lf you go down, baby. I go down, too.
- I'm not going down...

800
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,881
because there ain't no place down there
I wanna be.

801
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:41,145
Be going up, baby.
It'll just take a little time.

802
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,319
I love you, too. I love you.

803
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:49,392
Sure, I've taken a few shots,
but only when I needed it...

804
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,591
and I'm not hooked, Louis. Wait, baby.

805
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:56,228
Only when you needed it.
What do you think hooked is?

806
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:01,167
All I had to do is listen to your voice
on the telephone, and I knew.

807
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,471
Who do you think you're talking to?

808
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,172
One of those old fake cats
you be running around with?

809
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:09,445
I've been on those streets all of my life.
I know what that shit is.

810
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,385
It's good, ain't it?

811
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,420
Wait. Wait, wait.

812
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,159
We're going home, now.

813
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,965
Wait, hey, baby, wait.

814
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:27,058
See? You don't understand.

815
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,531
Now, you don't know how it is...

816
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:34,131
when people are looking down at you
and laughing at you...

817
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,438
and think that I'm a loser.

818
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:39,514
And if I go home now,
I'll think that I'm one, too.

819
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,175
I gotta prove it to them,
I gotta prove it to myself.

820
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,548
What're you proving with that needle?

821
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:48,214
That you're not woman enough
to make it without a crutch...

822
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:51,960
a magic way out
when the going gets a little too rough?

823
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:55,820
I want you to make it, too, baby,
but not this way. Not this way.

824
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,454
Okay.

825
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,631
Okay, I promise you
I won't take any more stuff.

826
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,969
I promise you. I gotta stay out here.
You're gonna let me stay?

827
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:07,668
- No.
- Louis, please.

828
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:11,371
I get it. I'll be big, and then I can work
at a good club, and we'll be together.

829
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,108
I promise you, I won't take
any more stuff. Come on, Louis.

830
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,910
Come on, Louis,
won't you take your clothes off?

831
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,719
Come on, Louis, please. I can't go now.

832
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,883
I gotta take you home, baby,
because I know...

833
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,255
I ain't going.

834
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:29,991
Hey, Crazy Maurice and Weird Lucille
want us to go out there with them.

835
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:33,125
Lady, what do you have this door
locked for? You cool?

836
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,135
I'm fine, Harry.

837
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,237
Come on in.

838
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:45,044
Well, there he is. How the hell are you?

839
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,212
He's fine.

840
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,481
I just dropped by to see
if you needed anything...

841
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,186
like a trip back to the hotel
or something...

842
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,730
but I guess you got it covered...

843
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,232
- so I'll catch you later, okay?
- See you at the hotel.

844
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,369
Bye. See you at the hotel.

845
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,375
Harry's a good friend.

846
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:25,817
That's what every little girl needs,
a good friend like Harry.

847
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,356
Okay.

848
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:36,662
I'm gonna get some gas for the car,
and I'll take you back to the hotel.

849
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,192
Louis...

850
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,034
I love you.

851
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,075
I promise you. No more stuff, okay?

852
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,074
I promise you.

853
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,221
Nine.

854
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:10,923
- Come on, Billie.
- Five.

855
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,933
- Eight.
- Seven.

856
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,159
Here we go, babe.

857
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,067
$2 she hits them.

858
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,540
- Jesus Christ!
- What?

859
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,617
Billie, get out of sight.

860
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:29,809
- Billie, come on.
- No, goddamn.

861
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,078
Billie, get out of sight.

862
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:49,895
- Goddamn!
- How are you? Hi, motherfucker.

863
01:11:50,975 --> 01:11:54,342
- Motherfucker! Fuck you! Shit!
- Billie. Billie.

864
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:57,542
- Hey, you nigger! What you doing?
- Go!

865
01:11:58,115 --> 01:12:01,516
- You son of a bitch! Fuck you!
- They'll kill you, honey. They'll kill you.

866
01:12:02,186 --> 01:12:03,983
You motherfuckers get a good look!

867
01:12:04,088 --> 01:12:05,749
- I ain't finished!
- Get down there!

868
01:12:05,856 --> 01:12:08,984
- No! Kiss my ass, you motherfuckers!
- Get this bus going, you asshole!

869
01:12:09,093 --> 01:12:11,084
Kiss my ass, you white-ass fascists!

870
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,680
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

871
01:12:35,786 --> 01:12:38,254
Billie. Billie, don't, honey.

872
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:42,382
Don't, don't. Relax, relax.
Relax, it's okay. It's okay, Billie.

873
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:49,822
Guess who's out there?

874
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,867
Mr. Network Radio Scout himself
sitting out there as big as life.

875
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,401
Oh, no.

876
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,472
- He's right.
- That's right. Yeah.

877
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,408
Can you make it, Billie?

878
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,871
Sure, I can make it.

879
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:06,277
That's what we came out here for,
isn't it?

880
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,213
- Isn't she great?
- I'll help you.

881
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:10,842
No, that's fine. I'll take care of myself.

882
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:12,045
Okay.

883
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,516
Y'all get on out of here,
so I can get dressed and get ready.

884
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:20,754
- You know, I think I love you.
- Come on, now. Let's go.

885
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,454
Give me my tie.

886
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,112
<i>Give me</i>

887
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,075
I can't.

888
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:24,784
What the hell are you looking at?

889
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:43,596
<i>Ding dong ain't it swell
They just delivered the liberty bell</i>

890
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:47,231
<i>How sad all those Philadelphians
Will be</i>

891
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:52,470
<i>He keeps making fancy passes at me</i>

892
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:03,453
<i>And now, a word from our sponsor,
Sunray Soap. </i>

893
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:07,022
<i>Mommy, what am I gonna do?</i>

894
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,555
<i>What's the matter, Shirley?</i>

895
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:12,133
<i>Why are there tears
running down your cheeks?</i>

896
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,201
Good luck.

897
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:15,998
<i>'Cause none of the kids
will play with me. </i>

898
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:18,639
<i>Let me look at you. My, my. </i>

899
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:23,007
<i>I see. 
Your complexion is so dull and listless. </i>

900
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,313
<i>I think this is a job for Sunray Soap. </i>

901
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,406
<i>And later, that same day:</i>

902
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:32,044
<i>Mommy, Mommy, what am I gonna do?</i>

903
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:35,817
<i>I have so many friends
I don't know who to play with first. </i>

904
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:40,190
<i>- Play with yourself.
- And now, we continue with our show... </i>

905
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:43,321
<i>by introducing you
to still another new vocalist. </i>

906
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:46,595
<i>Sunray Soap brings you
the lovely and talented... </i>

907
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:50,070
<i>Miss Angela DeMarco. </i>

908
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:57,479
I'm next.

909
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:02,115
<i>Hello, Broadway
How do you do</i>

910
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:05,948
<i>I've waited a lifetime
To say hi to you</i>

911
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:10,389
<i>Hello, Broadway
Here comes me</i>

912
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:15,388
<i>And those who fought me
Will say they taught me</i>

913
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:18,295
<i>Everything I know</i>

914
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,734
<i>They used to fool me
Now they say they knew me</i>

915
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:26,239
<i>Hello, Broadway's opening night</i>

916
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:28,674
<i>Thank you for my name in lights</i>

917
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:30,768
<i>Hello, Broadway</i>

918
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:35,782
<i>I like your style
Now that I'm here, I'll wait for a while</i>

919
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:40,446
<i>Hello, Broadway
Here comes me</i>

920
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:48,527
<i>And that, ladies and gentlemen
of the listening and dancing audience... </i>

921
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:49,995
<i>is our show. </i>

922
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:53,329
<i>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
we're off the air. </i>

923
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,802
<i>You heard the Reg Hanley Band
with our featured vocalists... </i>

924
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:59,669
<i>Angela DeMarco and Debby McGee. </i>

925
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,037
We tried, Billie.

926
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:41,282
Those Sunray people,
they wouldn't go for it.

927
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,408
They just wouldn't buy it.

928
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:48,812
I suppose we could've told you upfront...

929
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:52,485
but we were just hoping they'd get some
sense in their heads and change their...

930
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:56,052
Mr. Marshall, the network scout, he was
on the phone all during the show...

931
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:57,655
arguing with them, Billie.

932
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:01,258
Look, you fellows
don't have to explain it. I understand.

933
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:06,601
They're trying to sell soap, right?
Everybody knows we don't use it.

934
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,879
Get a bright complexion...

935
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,276
pretty white hands.

936
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,353
We got a party to go to, don't we?

937
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:23,118
We still got a table at Cafe Manhattan.

938
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,115
Cafe Manhattan?

939
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,853
You told me if I went on tour,
I'd get downtown.

940
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,591
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

941
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:31,723
Yeah.

942
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:34,632
What you all just sitting there for?

943
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,226
Come on, gang.

944
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:39,335
We gonna get some of them
lily-white hands, ain't we?

945
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,035
That's right. We got a party to go to.

946
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:44,408
- Come on, Mama.
- Come on, baby.

947
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:56,314
That piano man's killing me
with them bad notes.

948
01:19:56,425 --> 01:19:57,756
I know.

949
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:04,123
- Billie, I say you're the greatest.
- I think you're the greatest, too.

950
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,400
What you...

951
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:11,166
Oh, man, Vic, you can't be ordering
no beer in a club like this, man.

952
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:14,333
You order beer, and they think
you want to wash your hair.

953
01:20:14,443 --> 01:20:16,274
Beer's what the sidemen get.

954
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:18,912
You gotta get something flashier.
You hit the big time, now.

955
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,941
His hair needs it.

956
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:26,919
Reg, Reg, Reg, my man.
You're my main man, you know that?

957
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,513
You all right in my book.

958
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:31,916
Come on, Harry.

959
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:36,190
There you go.

960
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:39,624
And one for Mama. Little Mama.

961
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:46,403
- All right, we're gonna have a toast.
- All right.

962
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,100
- Everybody.
- Here we go.

963
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:50,337
- To Reg.
- Well.

964
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:53,846
Who got us home, no more to roam...

965
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:56,179
and drink this goddamn foam.

966
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:58,648
Drink up.

967
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,186
All right.

968
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:13,597
- Harry, can you meet me outside?
- No.

969
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,570
What you mean, Har, "no"? Come on.

970
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,975
You ain't gonna get anything from me,
I mean, not right under his nose.

971
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:24,477
- I want to keep mine in one piece.
- I know you...

972
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:28,644
I know you ain't scared of Louis, now.
Come on.

973
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:32,352
Billie, go home. Go home.

974
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:39,721
I can't let them know them goddamn
soap bastards got to me.

975
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,322
Don't do that to me, buddy.

976
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,933
You think I'm crazy enough
to carry in the city?

977
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:48,502
Come on, pal.

978
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:51,768
Billie, go home.

979
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:55,339
You know you can't fight it when you're
hooked, and you are hooked.

980
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:57,878
You're an A number-one mainliner.

981
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:01,748
You think so, huh?

982
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:06,048
Okay, pally.

983
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:09,053
Motherfucker.

984
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,591
I'm sorry.

985
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,422
My glass...

986
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,293
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm going home, Mama.

987
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:23,801
I don't feel so good. Just tired.

988
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,839
Hey, look, let's go.
This party's too tight ass for me.

989
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,138
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

990
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:31,940
No, wait a minute, now.

991
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,880
Listen, I got some business
to take care of.

992
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:37,349
Just hang on for a few minutes.
Everything will be smooth...

993
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,010
and I'll take you right on home, okay?

994
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,588
<i>A talented young lady is here tonight. </i>

995
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:44,125
No, it's not okay. If you don't get a cab,
I get my own self a cab, okay?

996
01:22:44,226 --> 01:22:45,591
Billie, take it easy, baby.

997
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:48,356
<i>With a little coaxing,
maybe we can get her up here to sing. </i>

998
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,226
Wait one minute. One minute. Okay.

999
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:53,768
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Cafe Manhattan proudly presents... </i>

1000
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:55,598
<i>Miss Billie Holiday. </i>

1001
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:06,873
Hey, Billie.

1002
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:09,174
They're all cheer for you.

1003
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,500
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1004
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,172
<i>You old gloomy sight</i>

1005
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:42,278
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1006
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:46,351
<i>Thought we said goodbye last night</i>

1007
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:50,816
<i>I tossed and turned until it seemed</i>

1008
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:52,894
<i>You had gone</i>

1009
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:58,090
<i>But here you are with the dawn</i>

1010
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,399
<i>Wish I'd forget you</i>

1011
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,240
<i>But you're here to stay</i>

1012
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,410
<i>It seems I met you</i>

1013
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,973
<i>When my love went away</i>

1014
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:20,949
<i>Now everyday, I start by</i>

1015
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,581
<i>Saying to you</i>

1016
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,988
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1017
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:29,723
<i>What's new</i>

1018
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:37,229
<i>Stop haunting me now</i>

1019
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:44,508
<i>Can't shake you, no how</i>

1020
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,884
<i>Just leave me alone</i>

1021
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:58,417
<i>I've got those Monday blues</i>

1022
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,454
<i>Straight through Sunday blues</i>

1023
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:06,266
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1024
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:10,035
<i>Here we go again</i>

1025
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,298
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1026
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:18,139
<i>You're the one who knew me when</i>

1027
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:22,942
<i>Might as well get used to you</i>

1028
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:26,143
<i>Hanging around</i>

1029
01:25:27,823 --> 01:25:31,224
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1030
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:35,055
<i>Sit down</i>

1031
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,037
Let's hear it for her, folks.

1032
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,138
- Billie Holiday.
- One more. One more.

1033
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:59,246
Come on. Let's bring her back, folks.
Bring her back. Billie Holiday.

1034
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:15,661
Come on, baby, I gotta pee.

1035
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,030
So that's why you ran out
of the club so fast, huh?

1036
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,129
Yeah.

1037
01:26:20,976 --> 01:26:22,375
Ain't that something? Well...

1038
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,712
Come on, baby, let me in.

1039
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:26,202
Wait a minute.

1040
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:27,804
Now, wait, wait, wait.

1041
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:31,046
They don't have no woman's john
at the club?

1042
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:33,620
You know they got a woman's john
at the club.

1043
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:35,713
- Come on.
- Come on what?

1044
01:26:35,824 --> 01:26:37,189
- It was dirty.
- What's dirty?

1045
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,590
What're you talking about?
Wait a minute.

1046
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:43,323
- The toilet at the club. Come on.
- What's wrong?

1047
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:45,123
What's wrong?

1048
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:46,996
Come on, I gotta go.

1049
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,369
I gotta... Come on, let me in.

1050
01:26:49,471 --> 01:26:52,702
You know what they say, you gotta go,
you gotta go. Here you go.

1051
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:55,870
Yeah, I know you don't want me...

1052
01:26:57,512 --> 01:26:58,501
Come on.

1053
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,877
You're always hogging up the bathroom.

1054
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:03,746
You never give me a chance
to get in the bathroom.

1055
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:05,911
- I'm getting so sick.
- You better use this.

1056
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:09,650
'Cause if you gotta go, you better
use this right now. Go on.

1057
01:27:09,758 --> 01:27:12,852
- 'Cause I can't let you in the bathroom.
- You want me to do it right here?

1058
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:15,555
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1059
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:19,767
What's the problem? Why are you sick?

1060
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:25,332
I am not gonna let you
go in that bathroom, not right now.

1061
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,532
Not right now.

1062
01:27:36,785 --> 01:27:37,843
Billie!

1063
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:39,879
God damn it!

1064
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,422
It's mine.

1065
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:52,362
Look, honey. I'll hold on to that stuff.
Wait, you're all...

1066
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:00,999
Billie.

1067
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:06,540
No, this is my...

1068
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:09,039
You're taking...

1069
01:28:09,184 --> 01:28:10,674
Give it to me.

1070
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,083
Give it.

1071
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:19,555
Give it to me.

1072
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:22,129
You'd kill me for it, wouldn't you?

1073
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,746
Going out for a walk.

1074
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:57,712
When I come back...

1075
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:03,617
I don't want to find you here.

1076
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:31,718
<i>If I should take a notion</i>

1077
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:34,721
<i>To jump into the ocean</i>

1078
01:31:34,923 --> 01:31:38,950
<i>Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>

1079
01:31:40,962 --> 01:31:44,193
<i>If I go to church on Sunday</i>

1080
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:47,660
<i>Then cabaret all day Monday</i>

1081
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:51,363
<i>Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>

1082
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:57,099
<i>If my man ain't got no money</i>

1083
01:31:57,212 --> 01:32:00,079
<i>And I say take all mine, honey</i>

1084
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:04,174
<i>Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>

1085
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,787
<i>I swear I won't call no copper</i>

1086
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:12,121
<i>If I'm beat up by my papa</i>

1087
01:32:12,427 --> 01:32:16,659
<i>Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>

1088
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:21,091
<i>Nobody's business</i>

1089
01:32:21,436 --> 01:32:24,462
<i>Ain't nobody's business</i>

1090
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:27,641
<i>Nobody's business if I do</i>

1091
01:32:34,349 --> 01:32:35,680
<i>Thank you. </i>

1092
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,685
<i>Thank you, you're sweet. </i>

1093
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:44,617
<i>You're so sweet sometimes. Thank you. 
Thank you very much. </i>

1094
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:49,356
<i>We gonna take a short intermission
right here, 'cause the band's gotta pee. </i>

1095
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:52,124
<i>We gonna be right back. </i>

1096
01:32:52,267 --> 01:32:55,498
<i>Bring up your girl, Yvonne,
to do a little dance for you. </i>

1097
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:59,198
<i>I thank you for your money
and your time. Thank you very much. </i>

1098
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:03,204
<i>- I'm your fan, sugar.
- You handsome devil, you. </i>

1099
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:06,208
I'll be right back. Right back.

1100
01:33:19,227 --> 01:33:22,287
- Billie, Billie, it's all yours. Hi, Reg.
- Hi.

1101
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:24,564
Jerry.

1102
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,826
Hey, Reg, what you doing here?

1103
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:30,496
- I just went to see your mother.
- Oh, yeah?

1104
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:33,073
She wanted to know if you were
coming by the hospital tonight.

1105
01:33:33,174 --> 01:33:36,234
Of course, I'm coming by.
You know I'm coming by.

1106
01:33:36,344 --> 01:33:38,505
You take care of your mama,
I take care of mine.

1107
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,604
Yeah, she just wanted to know,
that's all, Billie.

1108
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:42,615
Listen, I can wait around
and take you over there?

1109
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:44,116
- Jerry...
- What time is it?

1110
01:33:46,054 --> 01:33:49,888
9: 18. Jerry said he'd let you off early.
I asked him.

1111
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:54,060
You know, that song
you just got through singing...

1112
01:33:54,162 --> 01:33:55,857
<i>It 'Ain't Nobody's Business?</i>

1113
01:33:58,333 --> 01:33:59,561
Well, that's not true.

1114
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:02,158
Many people around
who love you, Billie.

1115
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,771
- Yeah, okay.
- Billie?

1116
01:34:05,873 --> 01:34:08,535
- Yeah?
- Sing pretty.

1117
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:23,088
Come on back. We're waiting.
Let's get down with it.

1118
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:32,599
<i>I don't know why</i>

1119
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:36,295
<i>But I'm feeling so sad</i>

1120
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,863
<i>I long to try</i>

1121
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:43,770
<i>Something I never had</i>

1122
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:47,337
<i>Never had no kissing</i>

1123
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:50,375
<i>Oh, what I've been missing</i>

1124
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:56,687
<i>Lover-man, oh, where can you be</i>

1125
01:34:58,059 --> 01:35:01,290
<i>The night is cold</i>

1126
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:04,728
<i>And I'm so all alone</i>

1127
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,567
<i>I'd give my soul</i>

1128
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:11,672
<i>Just to call you my own</i>

1129
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:16,070
<i>Got the moon above me</i>

1130
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:19,575
<i>But no one to love me</i>

1131
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:25,141
<i>Lover-man, oh, where can you be</i>

1132
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:32,457
<i>Don't go, Billie. Come on, back, baby,
and sing The Man I Love. </i>

1133
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,685
Take care of business.
Hurry back, Billie.

1134
01:35:34,796 --> 01:35:37,356
Yeah, be cool, baby. Don't overdo it.

1135
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:49,805
Baby, you wanna stick it in my eye?

1136
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:54,744
- Come on. Put it right up in there.
- Yeah, yeah.

1137
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:59,250
- Come on, sweetheart.
- I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

1138
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:07,455
- Hey, man, don't come in my room.
- Billie, what's wrong? Billie.

1139
01:36:07,562 --> 01:36:09,359
- Don't come in my room.
- Come on, Billie. Come on.

1140
01:36:09,464 --> 01:36:12,558
Girl, come on, you don't need
this gutter-pusher's shit, I'm telling you.

1141
01:36:12,667 --> 01:36:14,032
Look, I don't wanna talk to you.

1142
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:16,569
He cuts his shit.
You don't know what he cuts it with.

1143
01:36:16,671 --> 01:36:18,161
He don't care what he cuts it with.

1144
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:21,503
Goddamn, you gonna take a chance
on a hotshot on this nigger's reference?

1145
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:22,735
"Hotshot"?

1146
01:36:22,844 --> 01:36:24,471
- Wait.
- What you mean, "hotshot"?

1147
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:26,877
- Don't you never say that again.
- I'm sorry.

1148
01:36:27,482 --> 01:36:29,780
I didn't mean nothing by it, Hawk.

1149
01:36:29,884 --> 01:36:31,784
- Give me that shit.
- I'm sorry.

1150
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:34,150
Come on, just... Just...

1151
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:36,450
- Telephone.
- I appreciate you saying this. It's nice.

1152
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:39,018
- I can get some shit for us. Now, listen.
- Bullshit.

1153
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:40,560
I ain't going to no goddamn phone.

1154
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:42,561
- Wait a minute.
- Tell them to hold it, shit.

1155
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:44,187
Listen to me,
you're going to the phone now.

1156
01:36:44,298 --> 01:36:46,698
- I ain't going...
- Billie, it's the hospital.

1157
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:48,598
- There's a phone call.
- I ain't going to no...

1158
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:52,334
- I don't care if it's the hospital.
- Do you want it, baby?

1159
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:55,270
- Do you want it, baby?
- No, she don't want no shit now. Hawk.

1160
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:56,434
You want it, baby?

1161
01:36:56,544 --> 01:36:57,841
Don't do that to me.

1162
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,573
Billie, it's a phone call.

1163
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:05,449
- Come on, baby.
- Billie, I can get some shit, good shit.

1164
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,747
You understand?
I don't get high on beer, baby.

1165
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:09,550
You don't need this shit.

1166
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:17,591
Hello. Yeah. Yeah, this is Billie Holiday.
Who's this?

1167
01:37:19,767 --> 01:37:21,064
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

1168
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,451
Get on out of here.
Take care of your business.

1169
01:37:42,557 --> 01:37:44,320
Now, wait a minute, Hawk.
Hawk, now, wait.

1170
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:46,552
- I love Billie.
- Go on, man, get out of here.

1171
01:37:46,994 --> 01:37:49,861
You done hit me, man.
I'll get you, nigger.

1172
01:37:50,298 --> 01:37:51,764
Man, I'm sorry. I fucked up, didn't I?

1173
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:53,231
Man, I'm sorry. I fucked up, didn't I?

1174
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,899
You know me, though, man.
I used to get... You know that.

1175
01:37:58,105 --> 01:38:00,596
I see you steal shit
and sell it to you for stuff

1176
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:05,406
Get out.

1177
01:38:06,147 --> 01:38:08,945
- Billie, don't.
- Get out.

1178
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:12,281
- You heard what the lady said.
- I'm talking to you, Hawk.

1179
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,248
Get out.

1180
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:18,420
- Get out of here.
- Okay, I'm just gonna take this for my...

1181
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:20,883
- Billie, wait.
- Watch your mouth.

1182
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:22,121
I'm getting out!

1183
01:38:23,364 --> 01:38:24,490
Wait, now, Billie.

1184
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:28,057
- You dumb, girl. She's being dumb.
- Get out of here.

1185
01:38:28,169 --> 01:38:30,160
- Hawk. Hawk.
- I'm getting paid, though.

1186
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:36,599
We'll be out later. Yeah.
Did you see Jerry's face?

1187
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:43,675
Who gives a... Come on, Billie.

1188
01:38:43,784 --> 01:38:46,947
You handled that nigger.

1189
01:38:47,555 --> 01:38:49,250
Yeah, I know how you feel.
You gonna kick it.

1190
01:38:49,357 --> 01:38:52,520
I know you. You come to, you see?
You know, what I mean?

1191
01:38:52,627 --> 01:38:54,993
I need room, you know.
I don't need much.

1192
01:38:55,730 --> 01:38:57,721
You know, look at that. Nothing.

1193
01:38:58,366 --> 01:39:00,027
Dookie. That's right.

1194
01:39:02,203 --> 01:39:03,693
We go see Mama, huh?

1195
01:39:03,804 --> 01:39:06,102
The Duchess, laying up there,
been waiting for you.

1196
01:39:06,207 --> 01:39:09,472
She loves you. She love me, too, huh?
She says she gonna cook for me.

1197
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:12,374
- Piano Man.
- What? What, baby?

1198
01:39:13,648 --> 01:39:15,809
- Come on. You went through a lot.
- Mama...

1199
01:39:17,018 --> 01:39:18,645
Yes, Mama.

1200
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:24,319
- That nigger scared me.
- My mama didn't make it.

1201
01:39:24,425 --> 01:39:28,054
"Mama didn't make it. "
Mama didn't make what?

1202
01:39:28,162 --> 01:39:29,789
What you talking about,
"Mama didn't make it"?

1203
01:39:29,897 --> 01:39:31,125
Stop that now.

1204
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:33,293
The Duchess is gone.

1205
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:38,227
Billie.

1206
01:39:50,518 --> 01:39:54,215
Billie, your mama.
Your mama's gone, Billie.

1207
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:06,796
Piano Man.

1208
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:08,794
Piano Man.

1209
01:40:21,282 --> 01:40:23,182
Mama.

1210
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:28,911
Everything's going wrong.

1211
01:41:16,604 --> 01:41:18,037
Mr. McKay?

1212
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:21,605
- Dr. Grossman?
- Yes, how are you?

1213
01:41:22,977 --> 01:41:25,241
It's good to see you. You're on time, too.

1214
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,072
It's good to see you.

1215
01:41:27,381 --> 01:41:29,246
I'm very happy you called me.

1216
01:41:29,517 --> 01:41:31,747
Well, to tell you the truth...

1217
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:34,244
I had no choice.

1218
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:37,824
You see, it's a question of the bill.

1219
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:39,816
She seems to be
under the impression...

1220
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:41,121
that we could make
some arrangements.

1221
01:41:41,228 --> 01:41:43,423
- Where is she?
- Why, she's right there by the tree.

1222
01:41:43,531 --> 01:41:47,592
Listen, will you do me a little favor?
Don't tell her I'm taking care of it.

1223
01:41:48,068 --> 01:41:50,400
Okay. Now, you do me a favor.

1224
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:53,567
Don't you tell her I contacted you.

1225
01:41:53,808 --> 01:41:56,174
You know, it's a matter of ethics,
you know?

1226
01:41:57,244 --> 01:42:00,680
And I need her full confidence.
You understand?

1227
01:42:01,415 --> 01:42:04,646
But the fact that she came here alone
speaks a lot for her.

1228
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:09,211
Doctor, do you mind if I have
one of your nurses give her this?

1229
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:11,516
No, not at all. Nurse.

1230
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:16,723
Would you give this box
to Miss Holiday?

1231
01:42:16,831 --> 01:42:18,822
She's over there under the tree.

1232
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,329
I appreciate this, Doctor.

1233
01:42:22,269 --> 01:42:24,863
- Thank you so much.
- Don't mention it. Don't mention it.

1234
01:42:25,072 --> 01:42:28,235
- Well, I hope you have a good visit.
- Yeah, thank you.

1235
01:42:58,672 --> 01:42:59,798
Boo.

1236
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:03,202
Oh, Louis.

1237
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:06,405
How'd you find me?

1238
01:43:07,815 --> 01:43:10,306
I didn't tell anybody
where I was gonna be.

1239
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:15,949
Listen, I heard about your mom.
I'm sorry, baby.

1240
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:19,523
I wish there was something
I could've done.

1241
01:43:19,627 --> 01:43:20,651
No.

1242
01:43:21,996 --> 01:43:24,362
I have to start doing things for myself.

1243
01:43:24,565 --> 01:43:25,623
Louis...

1244
01:43:26,267 --> 01:43:28,895
I made up my mind. No more singing.

1245
01:43:29,737 --> 01:43:32,900
It only seems to get me into trouble,
you know?

1246
01:43:33,574 --> 01:43:36,543
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
Let me see your eyes, okay?

1247
01:43:36,644 --> 01:43:40,045
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Let me see. Let me see.

1248
01:43:45,452 --> 01:43:47,044
Don't look so hot, huh?

1249
01:43:49,857 --> 01:43:51,620
You're beautiful.

1250
01:43:52,493 --> 01:43:53,482
No.

1251
01:43:54,795 --> 01:43:58,788
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna make a deal with you.

1252
01:44:00,267 --> 01:44:02,701
If you promise to be Mrs. Louis McKay...

1253
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:06,595
I promise
I'll never leave you alone again.

1254
01:44:15,516 --> 01:44:16,813
You're kidding, aren't you?

1255
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:19,886
No, I'm not kidding, baby.
I'm not kidding.

1256
01:44:20,955 --> 01:44:24,618
Okay, it's a deal. It's a deal. It's a deal.

1257
01:44:25,526 --> 01:44:26,993
Fantastic.

1258
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:30,063
Now how about signing, sealing,
and delivering the goods...

1259
01:44:30,164 --> 01:44:32,189
right on that little finger right there?

1260
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:35,566
Okay, I better get to town
before the stores close.

1261
01:44:36,203 --> 01:44:39,172
- I'll be back tomorrow, bright and early.
- Okay.

1262
01:44:39,473 --> 01:44:42,306
- You take care of yourself, okay?
- Okay.

1263
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:50,148
I love you, you know that?
I'll always love you.

1264
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,832
Doctor. Doctor.

1265
01:45:14,174 --> 01:45:15,505
Billie Holiday?

1266
01:45:17,277 --> 01:45:20,337
- Billie Holiday?
- Yes. Yes, that's me.

1267
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:21,709
I'm Detective Hennen, New York City...

1268
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,077
Police Department, Narcotics Division.

1269
01:45:23,183 --> 01:45:25,242
- We got a warrant for your arrest.
- What's going on?

1270
01:45:25,352 --> 01:45:27,149
- We gotta take you in.
- What the hell's going on?

1271
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:28,619
We're taking her in for illegal use of...

1272
01:45:28,722 --> 01:45:29,814
She's under my medical care.

1273
01:45:29,923 --> 01:45:31,049
This is a private hospital.

1274
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:33,353
Look, Doc,
it's still illegal, and you know it.

1275
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:34,586
Now, don't give us any trouble.

1276
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:36,663
Get dressed, miss,
or we'll have to take you in...

1277
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:39,164
But you don't understand.
She's on gradual withdrawal.

1278
01:45:39,266 --> 01:45:42,235
<i>If she stops cold,
the shock to her system could kill her. </i>

1279
01:45:42,569 --> 01:45:44,628
<i>Don't you understand? It could kill her. </i>

1280
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:12,221
- How is she, Doc?
- We'll find out soon enough.

1281
01:46:12,332 --> 01:46:14,698
- Come on, get her up here.
- Hey, baby.

1282
01:46:14,835 --> 01:46:16,166
Let me see.

1283
01:46:17,538 --> 01:46:20,996
All right.
Now, Louis, help me get this off.

1284
01:46:21,442 --> 01:46:24,002
- You take this arm.
- I'm trying to get her out of this place.

1285
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:27,478
I'm sorry, they told me to get you
in and out of here in five minutes.

1286
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:30,475
- The right arm.
- Lift the sleeve.

1287
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:34,242
Here. Yeah, that's it.
Now, you hold her still now.

1288
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:36,689
There we are.

1289
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:41,990
Easy. Easy. Easy.

1290
01:46:42,096 --> 01:46:43,063
Okay.

1291
01:46:45,432 --> 01:46:47,957
Hold her still now. That's it. Now.

1292
01:46:54,842 --> 01:46:56,275
There we are.

1293
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:01,179
This could be worse.

1294
01:47:03,951 --> 01:47:05,316
But when she was at my place...

1295
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:08,877
- we gave her less, less, and less.
- I gotta get her out of this place.

1296
01:47:08,989 --> 01:47:11,719
And that helped her fight this off.
Her heart's very strong.

1297
01:47:11,825 --> 01:47:14,453
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I will have to ask you to hurry.

1298
01:47:17,664 --> 01:47:18,631
Coming.

1299
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:20,995
- Okay, let's take look.
- All right, now listen.

1300
01:47:22,236 --> 01:47:23,225
Good.

1301
01:47:23,337 --> 01:47:25,498
- Now you get this thing on again.
- I'll take care of that.

1302
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:27,267
- There we go.
- You go ahead, now.

1303
01:47:27,875 --> 01:47:28,933
Don't worry, Louis.

1304
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:32,068
All right, I'll catch up.
I'll catch you when you get outside.

1305
01:47:37,017 --> 01:47:40,475
Oh, baby. Baby.

1306
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:53,027
You must feel like the alonest girl...

1307
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:54,691
in this whole life right now.

1308
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:03,068
Listen. Listen, baby. Listen.

1309
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:04,541
Look.

1310
01:48:07,114 --> 01:48:10,174
You see that? You see?

1311
01:48:10,284 --> 01:48:11,751
You see that?

1312
01:48:14,188 --> 01:48:15,587
If you hear me...

1313
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:19,558
this is gonna be yours.

1314
01:48:20,761 --> 01:48:23,252
No, please take me home.

1315
01:48:26,133 --> 01:48:28,260
I'm gonna give you this with love.

1316
01:48:30,537 --> 01:48:31,765
With all...

1317
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:35,836
All of the love I know and feel for you.

1318
01:48:40,914 --> 01:48:42,142
Billie.

1319
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:50,449
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to go.
I'm sorry.

1320
01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:51,949
Billie.

1321
01:48:53,961 --> 01:48:55,553
I'm with you, baby.

1322
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:02,862
I'll always be with you.

1323
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:15,547
<i>Lady sings the blues</i>

1324
01:49:16,817 --> 01:49:21,186
<i>She's got 'em bad</i>

1325
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:26,926
<i>She feels so sad</i>

1326
01:49:28,295 --> 01:49:33,096
<i>Wants the world to know</i>

1327
01:49:35,936 --> 01:49:40,873
<i>Just what her blues is all about</i>

1328
01:49:43,343 --> 01:49:46,676
<i>The blues ain't nothing</i>

1329
01:49:46,813 --> 01:49:50,613
<i>But a pain in your heart</i>

1330
01:49:51,818 --> 01:49:55,618
<i>When you got a bad start</i>

1331
01:49:56,690 --> 01:50:01,320
<i>You and your man have to part</i>

1332
01:50:01,895 --> 01:50:03,157
- She'll be here any minute.
- Be quiet.

1333
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:04,376
Hold it. Hold it. Everybody, hold it.
Now, wait a minute.

1334
01:50:04,411 --> 01:50:05,490
Hold it. Hold it. Everybody, hold it.
Now, wait a minute.

1335
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,794
This is a welcome-home party
for Billie, yeah?

1336
01:50:07,901 --> 01:50:09,528
I tell you what, let's all be nice and jolly.

1337
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:14,668
And you, not one word about jail
or bars or serving time or...

1338
01:50:14,775 --> 01:50:16,037
- Or nervousness.
- Or nervousness.

1339
01:50:16,143 --> 01:50:17,576
Would you move out the way?

1340
01:50:17,678 --> 01:50:20,704
- She's here. She's here. She's here.
- One minute. I tell you what.

1341
01:50:20,814 --> 01:50:22,714
Everybody get in place
and turn out the lights.

1342
01:50:22,816 --> 01:50:24,716
- But I didn't get the sign up.
- Turn off the lights.

1343
01:50:24,818 --> 01:50:26,547
- Get it up.
- Turn off the lights.

1344
01:50:26,753 --> 01:50:27,777
Please.

1345
01:50:28,422 --> 01:50:32,085
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- The lights.

1346
01:50:36,096 --> 01:50:37,324
Nice and quiet.

1347
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:41,229
What do you mean?
She stepped on my foot.

1348
01:50:42,035 --> 01:50:43,229
Quiet.

1349
01:50:49,343 --> 01:50:51,243
- Surprise!
- Surprise, Billie.

1350
01:50:52,045 --> 01:50:55,276
- You look great, Billie.
- Welcome home, Billie.

1351
01:50:55,549 --> 01:50:58,882
Nice to see you, Billie.
I hope, we're not intruding.

1352
01:51:01,154 --> 01:51:04,715
The funny thing about being away,
you forget what everybody look like.

1353
01:51:05,258 --> 01:51:06,919
- I tried to...
- He's still homely.

1354
01:51:09,363 --> 01:51:12,924
I tried to picture your faces
so many times, but...

1355
01:51:17,037 --> 01:51:19,528
I got a little blurry.
I couldn't figure what you look like.

1356
01:51:19,873 --> 01:51:22,068
Do a party. Give me a kiss.

1357
01:51:24,544 --> 01:51:27,035
Bring her in. Let's show her
what we got for her. Get up.

1358
01:51:27,147 --> 01:51:29,809
- Thank you.
- How about one for your first boss?

1359
01:51:35,155 --> 01:51:37,214
- And me.
- Leave her alone.

1360
01:51:37,391 --> 01:51:39,188
Why don't you shut up?

1361
01:51:39,292 --> 01:51:42,193
You didn't let none of them dikey broads
get to you, did you?

1362
01:51:42,295 --> 01:51:43,785
- Come on. Come on.
- Big dinner.

1363
01:51:43,964 --> 01:51:45,522
Fried chicken?

1364
01:51:49,002 --> 01:51:51,300
<i>Dance right out of my shoes</i>

1365
01:51:51,405 --> 01:51:53,498
<i>Never see you
With your clothes on, dear</i>

1366
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:58,604
<i>Band starts playing
The lowdown shuffle blues</i>

1367
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,781
<i>Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah</i>

1368
01:52:03,183 --> 01:52:04,377
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1369
01:52:09,256 --> 01:52:12,521
- You never get that note.
- No, but you might yourself.

1370
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:16,385
You better come back 'cause
Jerry ain't made enough money yet.

1371
01:52:16,496 --> 01:52:19,056
We're just a poor, wicked being
with Mr. Jerry.

1372
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:22,599
When're you coming back?
Because we miss you, honest to God.

1373
01:52:22,702 --> 01:52:25,865
I don't care, rich or poor, we miss you.
But we're poor, we need you.

1374
01:52:25,972 --> 01:52:29,237
- Yeah, right.
- Well, I ain't gonna be coming back.

1375
01:52:30,577 --> 01:52:33,944
Unless you can get this piano
and the club into my kitchen...

1376
01:52:34,047 --> 01:52:37,710
because I'm gonna be cooking
for that pretty nigger over there...

1377
01:52:39,086 --> 01:52:43,250
so I can get fat,
and we might have some babies.

1378
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:47,617
<i>- Billie, I got something for you.
- Piano Man, a little arpège. </i>

1379
01:52:48,895 --> 01:52:50,157
We got something ourselves, over here.

1380
01:52:50,263 --> 01:52:51,355
Yeah.

1381
01:52:52,132 --> 01:52:54,032
Speech. Speech. Give me a little.

1382
01:52:54,701 --> 01:52:55,725
White man talking.

1383
01:52:56,837 --> 01:52:57,826
What is that?

1384
01:52:57,938 --> 01:53:00,406
Well, me and the band,
we've been doing pretty good...

1385
01:53:00,507 --> 01:53:03,943
all because of a certain lady,
and we even got a record contract.

1386
01:53:05,011 --> 01:53:06,103
Fantastic.

1387
01:53:06,213 --> 01:53:09,808
<i>And we cut one song I think
you might know, called Don't Explain... </i>

1388
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,117
and written by a little skinny lady.
And I put her name right on there.

1389
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:17,285
"Written by Miss Billie Holiday. "

1390
01:53:33,073 --> 01:53:35,837
<i>You know that I love you</i>

1391
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:38,577
<i>And what love endures</i>

1392
01:53:39,779 --> 01:53:42,339
<i>All my thoughts are of you</i>

1393
01:53:43,316 --> 01:53:45,841
<i>For I'm so completely yours</i>

1394
01:53:47,053 --> 01:53:48,884
<i>Cry to hear folks chatter</i>

1395
01:53:50,524 --> 01:53:53,186
<i>And I know you cheat</i>

1396
01:53:53,927 --> 01:53:56,361
<i>Right or wrong don't matter</i>

1397
01:53:57,597 --> 01:53:59,724
<i>When you're with me, sweet</i>

1398
01:54:01,635 --> 01:54:03,227
<i>Hush now</i>

1399
01:54:05,038 --> 01:54:06,938
<i>Don't explain</i>

1400
01:54:09,509 --> 01:54:13,036
<i>What is there to gain</i>

1401
01:54:15,048 --> 01:54:18,017
<i>I'm glad</i>

1402
01:54:18,118 --> 01:54:21,110
<i>You're back</i>

1403
01:54:23,023 --> 01:54:27,517
<i>Don't explain</i>

1404
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:47,771
It's about the best I can do...

1405
01:54:49,115 --> 01:54:51,106
but it isn't enough, is it?

1406
01:54:52,018 --> 01:54:53,781
Come on, what're you talking about?

1407
01:55:00,293 --> 01:55:05,230
How long is it gonna be before you get
back to work? A month? Two months?

1408
01:55:11,037 --> 01:55:14,837
- No.
- Who're you kidding, Billie?

1409
01:55:21,314 --> 01:55:22,747
Me, I guess.

1410
01:55:25,585 --> 01:55:29,180
- So what happens now?
- What do you think happens, woman?

1411
01:55:36,696 --> 01:55:38,425
You do it right this time.

1412
01:55:41,301 --> 01:55:42,825
Get yourself...

1413
01:55:46,039 --> 01:55:49,167
an agent that'll take care
of your career...

1414
01:55:52,012 --> 01:55:55,277
and a husband that'll take care of you.

1415
01:55:56,149 --> 01:55:58,014
I love you.

1416
01:55:58,985 --> 01:55:59,952
I really do.

1417
01:56:04,424 --> 01:56:07,791
I meant what I said
about working in the kitchen.

1418
01:56:07,894 --> 01:56:09,953
Working in the kitchen?
What're you gonna do in there?

1419
01:56:10,063 --> 01:56:12,258
You still haven't learn to boil an egg.

1420
01:56:23,109 --> 01:56:26,272
You got a felony rap against you,
and that automatically revokes...

1421
01:56:26,379 --> 01:56:28,540
your license in New York.
You know that.

1422
01:56:28,648 --> 01:56:29,910
No, I didn't know that.

1423
01:56:30,183 --> 01:56:32,947
And if you're not working in New York,
you're nothing.

1424
01:56:33,453 --> 01:56:38,117
Give me an idea. Give me a suggestion.
I'll work with you. I love your work.

1425
01:56:39,526 --> 01:56:42,256
- But what can I do?
- Let's kick it around.

1426
01:56:42,529 --> 01:56:44,520
All right. Think about it.

1427
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:48,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1428
01:56:49,202 --> 01:56:51,329
Wait a minute.

1429
01:56:53,106 --> 01:56:55,506
You do something for me,
Miss Holiday...

1430
01:56:56,643 --> 01:57:00,272
and I'll do something for you.
I'll get you back in New York.

1431
01:57:00,613 --> 01:57:04,105
You take a month, no, two months
on the road.

1432
01:57:04,284 --> 01:57:07,219
I'll book you into top spots.
Be sure of that.

1433
01:57:07,854 --> 01:57:10,687
You bring me back reviews
that are raves.

1434
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:12,485
And you'll kill them.
I know you'll kill them.

1435
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:14,787
- I don't wanna work on any bus tours.
- No, wait a minute.

1436
01:57:14,894 --> 01:57:17,226
- Let him finish what he's saying...
- You knock them dead...

1437
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:22,131
you sing your heart out,
you bring me back that publicity...

1438
01:57:23,236 --> 01:57:27,195
I'll make those license commissioners
take notice. You know how?

1439
01:57:27,941 --> 01:57:30,375
I'll get you Carnegie Hall.

1440
01:57:32,512 --> 01:57:34,776
No, wait. Wait a minute.

1441
01:57:35,081 --> 01:57:38,642
Now, wait, wait, wait.
I know you don't sing opera.

1442
01:57:38,752 --> 01:57:41,653
I know you don't sing
with the hands held over here.

1443
01:57:41,755 --> 01:57:45,521
I know your style,
but that's the very point.

1444
01:57:45,725 --> 01:57:49,786
- I am a jazz singer. And...
- Now you got it.

1445
01:57:50,597 --> 01:57:53,964
Did you ever hear
of any agent in the world...

1446
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:57,366
booking a jazz singer
into Carnegie Hall?

1447
01:57:57,971 --> 01:58:00,565
I'll have the newspaper guys,
the magazine fellows...

1448
01:58:00,673 --> 01:58:02,664
the radio, the newsreel.

1449
01:58:03,743 --> 01:58:04,903
And, Billie...

1450
01:58:05,779 --> 01:58:09,215
when that curtain goes down
on your opening night...

1451
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:14,311
you're gonna hear a noise
that'll shake that frigging place.

1452
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:17,086
Then show me
the license commissioner...

1453
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:21,024
with the courage, who would dare
not to give you back your license.

1454
01:58:21,127 --> 01:58:23,391
That audience will tear him into bits.

1455
01:58:24,164 --> 01:58:26,598
- Billie, you're gonna do it?
- What do you think?

1456
01:58:27,033 --> 01:58:28,898
You couldn't do that for me, could you?

1457
01:58:29,903 --> 01:58:32,394
- You've made a deal.
- I'd have to take my manager.

1458
01:58:32,505 --> 01:58:34,405
I just have two people
that I have to take.

1459
01:58:34,507 --> 01:58:36,771
I have to take my piano player, and...

1460
01:58:38,778 --> 01:58:40,746
Louis, you will go with me, won't you?

1461
01:58:41,614 --> 01:58:43,047
Come on.

1462
01:58:44,484 --> 01:58:45,746
- Carnegie Hall?
- All right, when do we leave?

1463
01:58:45,852 --> 01:58:49,344
All right, we get Carnegie Hall.
Yes, Carnegie Hall's a big deal.

1464
01:58:49,456 --> 01:58:50,423
It's a deal.

1465
01:58:50,957 --> 01:58:52,891
<i>It's very clear</i>

1466
01:58:54,227 --> 01:58:57,492
<i>Our love is here to stay</i>

1467
01:58:57,964 --> 01:59:00,159
<i>Not for a year</i>

1468
01:59:00,633 --> 01:59:03,363
<i>But ever and a day</i>

1469
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:05,359
<i>The radio</i>

1470
01:59:07,073 --> 01:59:10,201
<i>And the telephone
And the movies</i>

1471
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:11,277
<i>That we know</i>

1472
01:59:11,377 --> 01:59:14,073
<i>May just be passing fancies</i>

1473
01:59:14,214 --> 01:59:17,706
<i>And, in time, may go</i>

1474
01:59:17,851 --> 01:59:19,614
<i>But, oh, my dear</i>

1475
01:59:20,954 --> 01:59:23,218
<i>Our love is here to stay</i>

1476
01:59:24,357 --> 01:59:26,154
<i>Together we're</i>

1477
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,690
<i>Going a long, long way</i>

1478
01:59:30,964 --> 01:59:33,364
<i>In time the Rockies may crumble</i>

1479
01:59:33,533 --> 01:59:35,228
<i>Gibraltar may tumble</i>

1480
01:59:36,469 --> 01:59:38,369
<i>They're only made of clay</i>

1481
01:59:39,539 --> 01:59:42,235
<i>But our love is here to stay</i>

1482
01:59:56,222 --> 02:00:00,022
<i>The radio
And the telephone</i>

1483
02:00:00,126 --> 02:00:03,095
<i>And the movies
That we know</i>

1484
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:04,891
<i>May just be passing fancies</i>

1485
02:00:06,165 --> 02:00:08,531
<i>And in time may go</i>

1486
02:00:09,269 --> 02:00:11,794
<i>But, oh, my dear</i>

1487
02:00:11,905 --> 02:00:14,965
<i>Our love is here to stay</i>

1488
02:00:16,743 --> 02:00:21,442
<i>Together we're
going a long, long way</i>

1489
02:00:22,448 --> 02:00:25,281
<i>In time, the Rockies may crumble</i>

1490
02:00:25,385 --> 02:00:26,977

1493
02:00:33,826 --> 02:00:36,090
<i>Our love is here to</i>

1494
02:00:36,930 --> 02:00:40,593
<i>Our love is here to stay</i>

1495
02:00:44,704 --> 02:00:48,538
My business is falling apart without me.
I been out here three months already.

1496
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,877
What'd Bernie say on the phone
two hours ago?

1497
02:00:51,978 --> 02:00:54,242
Another one or two weeks ought to do it.

1498
02:00:54,547 --> 02:00:55,775
That's Bernie's new slogan.

1499
02:00:55,882 --> 02:00:58,214
I've never heard it before,
except 1,000 times.

1500
02:00:58,318 --> 02:01:00,445
Pretty soon it's not gonna matter
one way or the other.

1501
02:01:00,553 --> 02:01:02,680
It matters. That we know. All right?

1502
02:01:03,189 --> 02:01:06,852
Louis, Louis, wait just a minute.
Look, I'm sick and tired...

1503
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,224
of all these train stations
and strange hotels.

1504
02:01:09,329 --> 02:01:10,353
I wanna be at home...

1505
02:01:10,463 --> 02:01:13,626
and, with you leaving now, I don't know
what I'm gonna do, you know?

1506
02:01:13,733 --> 02:01:16,827
Well, at least with me in New York City,
I can pressure Bernie.

1507
02:01:16,936 --> 02:01:19,200
- You know, I can keep an eye on him.
- To hell with Bernie.

1508
02:01:19,305 --> 02:01:20,294
I'm not thinking about Bernie.

1509
02:01:20,406 --> 02:01:22,567
I'm thinking about you and me.
You know I need you.

1510
02:01:22,675 --> 02:01:24,142
You told me
you were never gonna leave me.

1511
02:01:24,243 --> 02:01:25,232
I know, baby, listen...

1512
02:01:25,345 --> 02:01:26,812
You told me
you would never leave me alone.

1513
02:01:26,913 --> 02:01:29,245
Give me the smile, come on.
You're not gonna let me leave...

1514
02:01:29,349 --> 02:01:31,647
without that beautiful smile
on your face. Give me the sun.

1515
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:33,685
- Give me the shine.
But, Louis, I'm scared.

1516
02:01:33,786 --> 02:01:38,280
Please. Please, shine for me.
Please. Please. Come on.

1517
02:01:42,495 --> 02:01:43,894
Call me right away.

1518
02:02:13,726 --> 02:02:17,218
<i>You've forgotten the words</i>

1519
02:02:18,865 --> 02:02:21,459
<i>I love you</i>

1520
02:02:23,202 --> 02:02:25,602
<i>Each memory</i>

1521
02:02:26,272 --> 02:02:28,797
<i>That we've shared</i>

1522
02:02:31,144 --> 02:02:36,047
<i>You ignore every star above you</i>

1523
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:44,956
<i>And can't realize you ever cared</i>

1524
02:02:47,727 --> 02:02:51,891
<i>You've changed</i>

1525
02:02:53,166 --> 02:02:57,933
<i>You're not the angel I once knew</i>

1526
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:05,936
<i>No need to tell me that we're through</i>

1527
02:03:09,582 --> 02:03:14,519
<i>It's all over now</i>

1528
02:03:16,022 --> 02:03:20,186
<i>You've changed</i>

1529
02:03:24,997 --> 02:03:27,727
We're in Hollywood, baby.
We're gonna be in the movies.

1530
02:03:27,834 --> 02:03:30,667
That's right. We're gonna be famous.
You're gonna be a star, right?

1531
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:34,866
We'll team up. We'll be great together.
I'll be like Valentino. You be like...

1532
02:03:35,641 --> 02:03:38,132
We be like Valentino
and What's-her-name. You know?

1533
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:39,370
Me and you, baby.

1534
02:03:39,479 --> 02:03:43,176
- It's going to be all right.
- I don't understand it.

1535
02:03:43,516 --> 02:03:45,507
It's been two months
since Louis left, right?

1536
02:03:45,618 --> 02:03:46,744
Yeah.

1537
02:03:46,853 --> 02:03:49,117
What the hell's the matter
with Bernie? He told me...

1538
02:03:49,222 --> 02:03:52,419
it wasn't gonna be but two months.
We've been out here seems like forever.

1539
02:03:53,326 --> 02:03:55,487
- Oh, my goodness.
- He is jive. You understand?

1540
02:03:55,595 --> 02:03:58,257
We've been working good hotels
and everything. We been getting...

1541
02:03:58,364 --> 02:03:59,661
good reviews, and we...

1542
02:03:59,766 --> 02:04:02,166
I wanna get back to New York.
I wanna get home.

1543
02:04:02,268 --> 02:04:05,135
Don't worry about it. It's gonna be cool.
I know it's gonna work out.

1544
02:04:05,238 --> 02:04:06,933
You know why I know
it's gonna work out?

1545
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:10,337
Because it's gonna work out.
We gonna play Carnegie Hall one day.

1546
02:04:10,443 --> 02:04:11,410
That's right.

1547
02:04:11,844 --> 02:04:16,144
It'd be the first Carnegie concert
with a 90-year-old old maid: Me.

1548
02:04:16,682 --> 02:04:18,547
And a 92-year-old polygamist.
That's me.

1549
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:20,516
Because I ain't gonna be
no old maid, you know.

1550
02:04:21,454 --> 02:04:22,580
Oh, boy.

1551
02:04:24,624 --> 02:04:26,717
We gonna just have to get
some connections, that's all.

1552
02:04:26,826 --> 02:04:28,851
We gonna have to get
some connections, that's all.

1553
02:04:28,961 --> 02:04:31,657
I got connections, baby.
Big connections.

1554
02:04:31,998 --> 02:04:33,932
- You got connections?
- That's right.

1555
02:04:34,534 --> 02:04:35,694
- Out here?
- Back.

1556
02:04:35,935 --> 02:04:37,926
- Out here in California?
- Yeah. Yes.

1557
02:04:38,037 --> 02:04:41,200
Okay, why don't you get some stuff?

1558
02:04:41,674 --> 02:04:46,270
I'm really depressed. I'm down and...
Come on, now.

1559
02:04:47,947 --> 02:04:49,608
- Come on, Piano Man.
- Pay day's two days away.

1560
02:04:49,715 --> 02:04:51,307
I'm busted, right?

1561
02:04:51,417 --> 02:04:54,386
You ain't got no money, neither.
You talking about getting some stuff?

1562
02:04:56,255 --> 02:04:59,156
Okay, that's all right. Forget it.
I can get my own connections, then.

1563
02:05:00,893 --> 02:05:04,659
Lady, we've been through this shit
before, man. You gonna mess up...

1564
02:05:04,764 --> 02:05:07,358
That's all right.
I just wanna cop now, you know?

1565
02:05:08,401 --> 02:05:09,595
No big thing.

1566
02:05:14,574 --> 02:05:18,601
Don't worry about it. I'll do it myself.
You know, I'll take care of it.

1567
02:05:18,711 --> 02:05:20,178
You ain't your brother's keeper,
you know?

1568
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:22,270
Why don't you tell that nigger
you got in New York...

1569
02:05:22,381 --> 02:05:23,643
I ain't your brother's keeper?

1570
02:05:25,051 --> 02:05:28,111
You can't get something for nothing
out here, girl. Did you know that?

1571
02:05:29,956 --> 02:05:31,548
I ain't trying to get
something for nothing.

1572
02:05:31,657 --> 02:05:32,681
What?

1573
02:05:32,792 --> 02:05:35,488
Just go on back to the hotel.
Go on back to the bungalow.

1574
02:05:35,595 --> 02:05:36,789
I'll meet you there later.

1575
02:05:37,797 --> 02:05:38,855
Billie.

1576
02:05:39,031 --> 02:05:40,862
I can handle it.
It's not the idea of that, man.

1577
02:05:40,967 --> 02:05:42,901
You're gonna get messed up
out here in the streets.

1578
02:05:43,002 --> 02:05:44,162
Why do you got to do that?

1579
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:46,465
You're a star now. You understand?
You're big time.

1580
02:05:46,572 --> 02:05:49,769
You're gonna... I can get the stuff,
all right? I'll meet you...

1581
02:05:49,876 --> 02:05:52,106
- Now you're talking, big boy.
- Yeah, now.

1582
02:05:52,211 --> 02:05:53,644
- Okay.
- I'll meet you back at the hotel.

1583
02:05:53,746 --> 02:05:55,714
- About an hour, all right?
- All right.

1584
02:05:56,349 --> 02:05:57,680
Take this.

1585
02:05:57,917 --> 02:06:00,112
Come on, now take it.
Now, you know, you need some money.

1586
02:06:00,219 --> 02:06:02,551
You can take this and pawn it.
We can get it back later.

1587
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:06,749
- Hey, you know what?
- Chicken butt.

1588
02:06:12,064 --> 02:06:15,693
<i>Them that's got shall get</i>

1589
02:06:16,802 --> 02:06:20,761
<i>Them that's not shall lose</i>

1590
02:06:23,276 --> 02:06:26,302
<i>So the Bible says</i>

1591
02:06:26,412 --> 02:06:27,709
Play your harmonica.

1592
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:32,312
<i>And it still is news</i>

1593
02:06:34,387 --> 02:06:37,948
<i>Mama, Mama may have</i>

1594
02:06:40,993 --> 02:06:43,223
<i>Papa may have</i>

1595
02:06:45,698 --> 02:06:49,532
<i>God bless the child</i>

1596
02:06:49,635 --> 02:06:52,195
<i>That's got his own</i>

1597
02:06:55,775 --> 02:06:59,438
You got your own harmonica.
I got my own harmonica.

1598
02:06:59,545 --> 02:07:01,410
I got my own high, too.

1599
02:07:01,914 --> 02:07:04,109
I knew you were trying to hog the horse.

1600
02:07:05,351 --> 02:07:06,318
Hang on.

1601
02:07:06,485 --> 02:07:08,715
Let me tell you something, you know...

1602
02:07:08,821 --> 02:07:10,482
How are we gonna...

1603
02:07:12,658 --> 02:07:13,784
Just a minute.

1604
02:07:14,126 --> 02:07:15,218
How we gonna be cool?

1605
02:07:15,328 --> 02:07:17,455
Piano Man, I've been trying to tell you.
You know what?

1606
02:07:17,964 --> 02:07:21,400
My father was all right.
You know, he never did whip me?

1607
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:24,094
You wanna know why?
'Cause he wasn't there.

1608
02:07:26,472 --> 02:07:27,496
He left my mama.

1609
02:07:27,606 --> 02:07:28,630
It's me, man.

1610
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:30,641
We coming, Me.

1611
02:07:31,444 --> 02:07:32,468
Me, it's Me.

1612
02:07:32,712 --> 02:07:35,704
- That's you at the door?
- That's what the man said: "It's Me. "

1613
02:07:38,451 --> 02:07:40,180
Hey, Me, we're coming.

1614
02:07:40,486 --> 02:07:42,283
- Yes.
- Say...

1615
02:07:42,388 --> 02:07:45,983
We gotta be cool, man.
Shit, it might be the Man.

1616
02:07:47,626 --> 02:07:49,253
- That's right.
- The Man.

1617
02:07:49,428 --> 02:07:52,693
That's the Man.
I ain't talking about, you know?

1618
02:07:53,265 --> 02:07:55,392
- Say, man.
- Herbie Emma Savits.

1619
02:07:55,501 --> 02:07:59,062
- "Say, man. "
- Who is it? Is this Me or Say Man?

1620
02:07:59,305 --> 02:08:00,602
It's Jimmy.

1621
02:08:01,741 --> 02:08:03,072
Come on, open the door.

1622
02:08:03,843 --> 02:08:06,209
Hey, Piano Man. Piano Man.

1623
02:08:06,712 --> 02:08:08,680
That might be the Man.
I better go and clean up.

1624
02:08:08,848 --> 02:08:11,078
Just a minute, we coming. Hold on.

1625
02:08:12,385 --> 02:08:13,682
- Come on, man.
- Tell him that...

1626
02:08:13,819 --> 02:08:15,411
Just a minute.

1627
02:08:16,956 --> 02:08:19,186
We have to flush the toilet.

1628
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:29,827
Okay, wait a minute.

1629
02:08:33,139 --> 02:08:34,868
Hey! Wait. Be...

1630
02:08:39,845 --> 02:08:41,710
Hey, who is it?

1631
02:08:41,981 --> 02:08:44,848
- Hey, it's Jim.
- Ain't nobody but me.

1632
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:47,111
All right. Just a minute.

1633
02:08:48,454 --> 02:08:50,115
- Jim.
- Right.

1634
02:08:50,256 --> 02:08:51,703
It's just Jim, baby.
Jim and me, I gotta...

1635
02:08:51,738 --> 02:08:53,150
It's just Jim, baby.
Jim and me, I gotta...

1636
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:55,288
- Who's Jim?
- He ain't the Man, anyhow.

1637
02:08:55,961 --> 02:08:58,259
Hey, Jimmy, I want you to meet...

1638
02:08:58,631 --> 02:09:00,064
Come on, hey, Jimmy.

1639
02:09:00,266 --> 02:09:01,790
- Hey.
- Hi, Jimmy.

1640
02:09:01,901 --> 02:09:03,129
Listen, Jimmy, this is Lady.

1641
02:09:03,502 --> 02:09:06,369
Jimmy's the man.
Hey, man, this is Lady.

1642
02:09:06,605 --> 02:09:08,596
Lady Day, this is Billie Holiday.

1643
02:09:09,075 --> 02:09:10,804
You know what I mean? The star.

1644
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:13,474
- I wanna talk to you, Piano Man.
- Sure, man.

1645
02:09:13,612 --> 02:09:15,512
Have a seat.
Why don't you guys come on in?

1646
02:09:15,614 --> 02:09:17,673
- You want a taste? You want a taste?
- Excuse me, ma'am.

1647
02:09:17,783 --> 02:09:18,943
Something? A little drink?

1648
02:09:19,251 --> 02:09:22,550
Hey, Piano Man,
my man here says that...

1649
02:09:22,655 --> 02:09:24,316
you and him
got some business to take care of.

1650
02:09:24,490 --> 02:09:26,082
I was coming back. You know what?

1651
02:09:26,926 --> 02:09:29,258
Man, you said you was gonna
drop right on back, baby...

1652
02:09:29,361 --> 02:09:31,352
and you didn't make it.
Now that ain't no way to act.

1653
02:09:31,464 --> 02:09:32,954
I got something for you, though.
No, I know.

1654
02:09:33,065 --> 02:09:35,158
- Piano Man, who is these guys?
- Let's not... Billie.

1655
02:09:35,267 --> 02:09:36,791
Well, look, baby, I'll tell you.

1656
02:09:37,136 --> 02:09:39,434
No, wait.
Damn. Now, wait a minute, man.

1657
02:09:39,538 --> 02:09:40,698
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1658
02:09:40,806 --> 02:09:42,637
I'll give you the ring.
You can take my ring.

1659
02:09:42,775 --> 02:09:44,003
Wait. Wait!

1660
02:09:49,815 --> 02:09:51,214
Billie!

1661
02:09:51,383 --> 02:09:54,352
- What are you doing to Piano Man?
- Goddamn it, Billie!

1662
02:09:54,453 --> 02:09:57,183
- What are y'all doing with him?
- Billie! God!

1663
02:10:00,059 --> 02:10:01,356
No, Billie, please.

1664
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:02,427
Get up.

1665
02:10:02,695 --> 02:10:05,255
Wait a minute, listen.
Look, I got the shit.

1666
02:10:08,134 --> 02:10:09,726
You can't steal from us like that, man.

1667
02:10:23,115 --> 02:10:25,379
They're gonna kill me. Billie!

1668
02:10:27,887 --> 02:10:28,979
Let him up.

1669
02:10:29,622 --> 02:10:32,216
- Billie.
- What did you do?

1670
02:10:35,427 --> 02:10:37,190
- I think we better get out of here now.
- Yeah.

1671
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:43,591
Golly. Golly.

1672
02:10:47,072 --> 02:10:51,065
Piano Man, look at you.
You're bleeding all over.

1673
02:10:51,477 --> 02:10:52,444
Piano Man.

1674
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:56,441
Piano Man,
what you doing with this ring?

1675
02:10:57,550 --> 02:11:00,110
You are always trying to be a hero,
Piano Man.

1676
02:11:00,219 --> 02:11:02,380
You were supposed to pawn
this goddamn ring.

1677
02:11:02,488 --> 02:11:04,456
Is that why the men beat you?

1678
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:10,291
You're still my friend.

1679
02:11:12,865 --> 02:11:15,459
<i>God bless the child</i>

1680
02:11:15,935 --> 02:11:18,301
<i>That's got his own</i>

1681
02:11:19,338 --> 02:11:22,000
<i>That's got his own</i>

1682
02:11:23,108 --> 02:11:25,542
<i>Mama may have</i>

1683
02:11:26,645 --> 02:11:31,105
Help, Mommy! Mama, help me!
Somebody, help me!

1684
02:11:35,654 --> 02:11:40,353
Piano Man! Wait a minute.
Piano Man, wait a minute.

1685
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,252
Jesus.

1686
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:48,996
Piano Man, you ain't dead, are you?
Don't die, Piano Man.

1687
02:11:52,371 --> 02:11:55,363
Piano Man is dead,
and everything is out of it here.

1688
02:11:55,874 --> 02:11:56,863
We got it.

1689
02:11:58,510 --> 02:12:01,001
We got Carnegie Hall.

1690
02:12:03,415 --> 02:12:04,973
Billie, did you hear me?

1691
02:12:06,485 --> 02:12:09,045
We finally got Carnegie Hall.

1692
02:12:10,589 --> 02:12:11,783
Billie, I can't hear you.

1693
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:14,986
Turn that damn radio off.

1694
02:12:16,362 --> 02:12:17,852
We must have a bad connection.

1695
02:12:19,565 --> 02:12:20,896
Did you hear me, Billie?

1696
02:12:23,869 --> 02:12:24,836
Wait a minute.

1697
02:12:26,038 --> 02:12:27,699
There's something wrong.
She sounds real funny.

1698
02:12:27,806 --> 02:12:29,364
What are you talking about?
Let me have that.

1699
02:12:29,475 --> 02:12:31,170
Billie, this is Louis. Look...

1700
02:12:32,978 --> 02:12:35,708
What's going on? You okay?

1701
02:12:36,382 --> 02:12:39,146
Louis, I'm scared out here.

1702
02:12:39,318 --> 02:12:42,446
Something scary is happening to me.

1703
02:12:45,024 --> 02:12:46,616
What the hell is going on out there?

1704
02:12:51,163 --> 02:12:54,564
See, we can't do everything
by ourselves.

1705
02:12:58,937 --> 02:13:01,633
- Is that the boyfriend?
- There he is. That's him.

1706
02:13:12,151 --> 02:13:13,982
I can't talk to you right now.

1707
02:13:14,453 --> 02:13:15,613
I don't know. I don't know.

1708
02:13:20,125 --> 02:13:21,183
Billie?

1709
02:13:23,329 --> 02:13:25,456
Who is it? Leave me alone, go away.

1710
02:13:25,564 --> 02:13:28,590
Billie, open the door.
Billie, it's Louis. Open the door.

1711
02:13:29,268 --> 02:13:33,204
- Who?
- Billie, it's Louis!

1712
02:13:34,707 --> 02:13:35,674
Louis?

1713
02:13:37,543 --> 02:13:38,567
Open the door.

1714
02:13:41,914 --> 02:13:43,074
Is that you, Louis?

1715
02:13:50,122 --> 02:13:51,282
It's me, baby.

1716
02:13:53,726 --> 02:13:56,251
Hey, Billie,
can we talk to you for a second?

1717
02:14:12,177 --> 02:14:16,341
I knew you'd come, Louis.
I knew you'd come.

1718
02:14:21,019 --> 02:14:22,418
I've been waiting for you.

1719
02:14:31,029 --> 02:14:32,656
Why is it so dark in here?

1720
02:14:35,901 --> 02:14:36,993
You all right?

1721
02:14:46,145 --> 02:14:47,203
What happened?

1722
02:14:53,085 --> 02:14:55,485
Baby, it's all right. Listen. Listen.

1723
02:14:58,123 --> 02:15:00,785
I love you, Louis.
You love me, don't you?

1724
02:15:00,893 --> 02:15:02,793
I knew you were gonna come. See?

1725
02:15:03,328 --> 02:15:05,796
Listen, baby, what happened?
What happened to Piano Man?

1726
02:15:08,901 --> 02:15:10,334
What's the matter with you?

1727
02:15:13,872 --> 02:15:15,100
Then why are you so...

1728
02:15:24,249 --> 02:15:28,709
I'm fine, see? Everything's fine.

1729
02:15:29,922 --> 02:15:30,889
I don't know.

1730
02:15:31,490 --> 02:15:34,618
See, these men, they followed me
from the inquest and...

1731
02:15:37,296 --> 02:15:38,820
bothered me and everything, and...

1732
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:43,359
This is all right, baby. It's all right.

1733
02:15:43,535 --> 02:15:46,368
Listen, it's all over now.

1734
02:15:50,042 --> 02:15:53,170
Piano Man is dead, and there's nothing.
We can't do anything about it...

1735
02:15:53,345 --> 02:15:54,835
but you're you.

1736
02:15:55,247 --> 02:15:57,272
You got to keep on living.
Now, you gotta...

1737
02:15:57,382 --> 02:15:58,644
Piano Man's dead.

1738
02:15:58,917 --> 02:16:00,885
Yeah, you got a lot of hard work
ahead of you now.

1739
02:16:00,986 --> 02:16:03,955
I mean, you gotta work hard. You gotta
put your mind on work, you know?

1740
02:16:04,056 --> 02:16:06,388
You got Carnegie Hall
to think about now.

1741
02:16:07,125 --> 02:16:08,888
I better get you home.
I'm gonna get you home.

1742
02:16:09,294 --> 02:16:13,526
- You know, Piano Man is dead.
- Yeah, I do.

1743
02:16:14,566 --> 02:16:18,434
See, Louis, I wish I was dead.

1744
02:16:18,537 --> 02:16:20,061
- Billie...
- I know.

1745
02:16:20,172 --> 02:16:21,799
- See...
- I'm gonna go pack your things now...

1746
02:16:21,907 --> 02:16:22,874
all right?

1747
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:25,670
It's not... I'm really...

1748
02:16:25,777 --> 02:16:27,938
See, Louis, I'm no good...

1749
02:16:29,548 --> 02:16:30,742
I don't...

1750
02:16:32,751 --> 02:16:35,686
See, Piano Man
was right over there. Louis?

1751
02:16:39,391 --> 02:16:41,518
I knew you'd come
and take care of me, see?

1752
02:16:44,863 --> 02:16:47,957
Hey, Louis, get me out of here, huh?

1753
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:51,228
I've been waiting for you, I...
You took so long to come by, and...

1754
02:16:51,336 --> 02:16:52,303
But...

1755
02:16:53,505 --> 02:16:55,564
Why do those guys keep bothering me?

1756
02:16:56,575 --> 02:16:58,509
I don't know them.

1757
02:16:59,511 --> 02:17:01,411
- Here you are, baby.
- I don't care, anyway.

1758
02:17:03,682 --> 02:17:06,048
Come on, take your hat now.
We're going home, okay?

1759
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:07,685
We're going home.

1760
02:17:07,819 --> 02:17:11,448
- We're going home.
- Yeah, we're going home, all right?

1761
02:17:12,257 --> 02:17:13,485
I'm going home, right?

1762
02:17:13,592 --> 02:17:14,389
Okay, you put your hat on.
We're going home.

1763
02:17:14,424 --> 02:17:15,186
Okay, you put your hat on.
We're going home.

1764
02:17:15,427 --> 02:17:18,692
Take the train right on into New York,
right into Penn Station, okay?

1765
02:17:19,064 --> 02:17:20,531
How much time we got? You wanna...

1766
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:24,928
We can do that on the train, okay?
Let's go. Heading to Carnegie Hall.

1767
02:17:26,305 --> 02:17:29,035
There you go. Come on, baby.
Big date. New York.

1768
02:17:29,374 --> 02:17:31,001
- What, we get...
- Big date.

1769
02:17:31,143 --> 02:17:33,703
- Carnegie Hall, that's right.
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

1770
02:17:34,613 --> 02:17:36,274
Okay, ready?

1771
02:17:39,518 --> 02:17:40,883
Louis.

1772
02:17:40,986 --> 02:17:42,010
- What, baby?
- Do you love me?

1773
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:44,213
I love you. Yes, I love you.

1774
02:17:45,557 --> 02:17:47,149
I love you. Now, come on, let's go.

1775
02:17:47,259 --> 02:17:50,228
And you gonna be with me?
See, because...

1776
02:17:52,731 --> 02:17:56,360
I'm a good girl. I don't mean...
I didn't mean to do things...

1777
02:17:56,468 --> 02:18:00,404
I know. I know, but let's...
Why don't we get out of here now?

1778
02:18:00,505 --> 02:18:02,700
Go on, now, go on.
Let's get the train.

1779
02:18:02,808 --> 02:18:03,797
Okay.

1780
02:18:03,909 --> 02:18:05,501
Straight into
Pennsylvania Station, okay?

1781
02:18:05,611 --> 02:18:06,578
Okay.

1782
02:18:06,678 --> 02:18:09,306
- Go back to New York, see? New York.
- Yeah.

1783
02:18:09,414 --> 02:18:12,144
- Home.
- Home. Home.

1784
02:18:12,884 --> 02:18:15,182
- Come on.
- I'm gonna take my coat.

1785
02:18:15,287 --> 02:18:16,777
You take your coat. Okay.

1786
02:18:17,656 --> 02:18:19,180
Okay, I'll take my hat.

1787
02:18:20,525 --> 02:18:23,392
- I'll put your hat on you.
- Okay.

1788
02:18:27,432 --> 02:18:28,421
Thank you.

1789
02:18:28,533 --> 02:18:32,867
- Here it is. Right there.
- It's all over now, Billie. It's all over.

1790
02:18:40,912 --> 02:18:43,540
Miss Holiday, could you give us
a statement about...

1791
02:18:43,649 --> 02:18:46,550
<i>Whatever my man is</i>

1792
02:18:47,786 --> 02:18:52,223
<i>I'm his forevermore</i>

1793
02:18:56,361 --> 02:19:00,263
<i>What's the difference if I say</i>

1794
02:19:00,832 --> 02:19:04,393
<i>I'll go my way</i>

1795
02:19:05,237 --> 02:19:09,936
<i>when I know I'll come back
On my knees</i>

1796
02:19:10,042 --> 02:19:11,805
<i>Some day</i>

1797
02:19:16,114 --> 02:19:21,017
<i>For whatever my man is</i>

1798
02:19:22,854 --> 02:19:26,415
<i>I'm his</i>

1799
02:19:27,392 --> 02:19:31,920
<i>Forevermore</i>

1800
02:19:54,786 --> 02:19:56,811
More, more!

1801
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:07,091
They're still screaming out there.

1802
02:20:08,266 --> 02:20:10,996
Billie, you made it. I love you.

1803
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:14,037
They love you. Listen to them scream.

1804
02:20:14,139 --> 02:20:15,333
I hear them. I hear them.

1805
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:20,139
The walls are shaking.
They never seen anything like tonight.

1806
02:20:20,245 --> 02:20:23,180
It's fantastic. Can I get my license now?

1807
02:20:23,281 --> 02:20:26,546
Are you kidding?
You've got all of New York City.

1808
02:20:26,651 --> 02:20:27,709
You're home.

1809
02:20:35,994 --> 02:20:38,087
Billie, you can't keep
Carnegie Hall waiting.

1810
02:20:38,196 --> 02:20:39,788
<i>Okay, I'll do God Bless the Child. </i>

1811
02:20:39,898 --> 02:20:40,865
<i>God Bless the Child. </i>

1812
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:42,489
- Kill them, Billie.
- I love you.

1813
02:20:42,601 --> 02:20:44,796
- I love you too.
- All right, later.

1814
02:21:06,725 --> 02:21:09,853
<i>Them that's got shall get</i>

1815
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:15,027
<i>Them that's not shall lose</i>

1816
02:21:15,967 --> 02:21:18,731
<i>So the Bible says</i>

1817
02:21:19,838 --> 02:21:23,501
<i>And it still is news</i>

1818
02:21:23,642 --> 02:21:26,372
<i>Mama may have</i>

1819
02:21:27,546 --> 02:21:30,037
<i>Papa may have</i>

1820
02:21:31,416 --> 02:21:34,317
<i>But God bless the child</i>

1821
02:21:34,419 --> 02:21:36,614
<i>That's got his own</i>

1822
02:21:37,589 --> 02:21:41,389
<i>That's got his own</i>

1823
02:21:44,863 --> 02:21:45,887
<i>Money</i>

1824
02:21:48,099 --> 02:21:51,500
<i>You got
Lots of friends</i>

1825
02:21:53,972 --> 02:21:57,965
<i>Crowding around the door</i>

1826
02:22:00,679 --> 02:22:01,668
<i>When it's gone</i>

1827
02:22:04,382 --> 02:22:07,112
<i>And spending ends</i>

1828
02:22:07,953 --> 02:22:11,684
<i>They don't come no more</i>

1829
02:22:13,592 --> 02:22:17,551
<i>Rich relations give</i>

1830
02:22:19,097 --> 02:22:23,193
<i>A crust of bread and such</i>

1831
02:22:24,903 --> 02:22:27,394
<i>You can help yourself</i>

1832
02:22:28,006 --> 02:22:31,942
<i>But don't take too much</i>

1833
02:22:32,477 --> 02:22:35,071
<i>Mama may have</i>

1834
02:22:35,981 --> 02:22:38,040
<i>Papa may have</i>

1835
02:22:39,351 --> 02:22:41,683
