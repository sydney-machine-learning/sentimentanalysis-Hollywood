1
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,226
- Engine room, chief still there?
- Yes, sir.

2
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:29,108
- It's the captain, put him on.
- Aye, aye, sir.

3
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:35,199
- Are you making contact?
- Yeah, I'm making contact.

4
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:39,988
Chief, the captain wants
you on the phone.

5
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,002
Chief here, go ahead.

6
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:46,912
What's going on? Anything more
you can do with the stabilizers?

7
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:50,590
There's nothing wrong
with the stabilizers.

8
00:02:50,844 --> 00:02:53,335
Besides, my hands are full
with this pump!

9
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:57,220
You know what the trouble is.
It's that bastard Linarcos.

10
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:01,604
Care to repeat yourself?
He's standing right here.

11
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:03,978
Good, I hope he heard me!

12
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:09,227
All right, Joe, do the best you can
until we clear this weather.

13
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:26,369
- Where the devil did you come from?
- From my cabin, sir.

14
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:29,460
Don't you realize it's
dangerous out there?

15
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:32,676
You said come up anytime.
Robin Shelby...

16
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:33,928
...remember?

17
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:37,465
You picked a particularly
fascinating moment to come here.

18
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,302
The waves don't bother you?

19
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,719
I've surfed up to 18 feet.

20
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:46,807
- But these look more like 30.
- Thirty-five to be exact.

21
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,190
Some get up to 300.

22
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:52,362
- I find 60 about maximum. Steady up.
- Steady up, sir.

23
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,290
- Bring her up.
- Bring her up, sir.

24
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:06,961
Hang on!

25
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,680
- All lifelines rigged?
- All except C deck, sir.

26
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:26,637
When I order all lifelines rigged
it includes C deck. See to it.

27
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:28,938
Wow, surf's really up.

28
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:30,521
- Master Shelby.
- Yes, sir?

29
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:34,021
We'll continue our discussion
another time. Fair enough?

30
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:35,948
Aye, aye, sir.

31
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,910
That last one almost
broached us, Linarcos.

32
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,952
I warned you. We should've
loaded extra bunkers in Gibraltar.

33
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,412
We are top-heavy and when
that pump is repaired...

34
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:50,297
...I am taking on more ballast.

35
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:54,705
- Where next?
- Mr. and Mrs. Rogo, M45.

36
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:07,644
- Yeah?
- I'm Dr. Caravello. You asked for me.

37
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:09,516
All morning.

38
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:12,900
- You the only doctor on this tub?
- The only ship doctor.

39
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:15,062
What if somebody was dying?

40
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:19,272
Oh, my God, who's not dying?

41
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:22,156
Most of the passengers
are sick, Mr. Rogo.

42
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:24,321
We have to take them in rotation.

43
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,540
Use one of these now,
another in 8 hours...

44
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:30,580
...and remain in bed
until the sea is calm.

45
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:32,666
Hold it, hold it.

46
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,340
You mean we had to wait all
this time for you to come...

47
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:41,054
...and give her some pills?
And some crap about staying in bed?

48
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:45,267
How do you know she's just seasick?
Look at her!

49
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,888
It could be something else.
You didn't even examine her.

50
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,891
Oh, shoot me, Mike.
For chrissake, just shoot me.

51
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,936
You see how sick she is?

52
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:59,562
I'll tell you what this is.
It's food poisoning, that's what.

53
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:03,943
How is she gonna swallow pills
when she can't even swallow water?

54
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:07,328
They're suppositories, Mr. Rogo.

55
00:06:07,582 --> 00:06:08,745
You...

56
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,410
...don't swallow them.

57
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:13,915
What do you do with them?

58
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:18,711
I know what to do with suppositories.
Just get them out of here!

59
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:20,719
Oh, hon....

60
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:24,387
Nurse, I think we should
continue with our rounds.

61
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:33,388
I still think it's food poisoning.

62
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,102
Oh, shut up.

63
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,469
- Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Rosen.
- Good morning.

64
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:07,307
Don't fall over.

65
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,312
- That Martin, he's crazy.
- I like that man.

66
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,150
Of course you like him.
He runs on time like a train.

67
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:20,898
You and trains.

68
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:24,448
When, in my whole life,
did I ever run for a train?

69
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:28,700
Who cried for a week when
they tore down the 3rd Avenue El?

70
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:30,904
Yeah.

71
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,496
He's lonely.

72
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:39,084
That's why he runs,
so you won't notice.

73
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,843
Says here there's a package
tour to the mountain...

74
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,716
...where Moses received
the Ten Commandments.

75
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:46,962
No.

76
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:51,435
When we finally get to Israel,
we're gonna stay put, no traveling.

77
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:54,053
We're gonna get to know our grandson.

78
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:59,109
Just think, he's 2 years old already.
He's talking.

79
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:01,400
We've never even seen him.

80
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:09,903
Get down on your knees
and pray to God for help...

81
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:12,833
...and then maybe everything
will work out?

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,329
Garbage.

83
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:18,254
Not where I come from.

84
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:24,090
You could wear off your knees praying
to God for heat in February.

85
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:28,047
And icicles would grow
from your upraised palms.

86
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,810
If you're freezing,
you burn the furniture...

87
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,010
- ...but you get off your knees.
- Somewhat unorthodox, Reverend Scott.

88
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:37,648
But realistic.

89
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,819
John, the church is
for more than prayer.

90
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:44,355
With those sermons, it's a wonder
you're still ordained.

91
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:46,524
- Or are you?
- The best kind.

92
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,784
Angry, rebellious,
critical, a renegade...

93
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:52,991
...stripped of most of my
so-called clerical powers.

94
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:55,157
But I'm still in business.

95
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,209
- You seem to enjoy the punishment.
- Punishment?

96
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:01,621
The church has blessed me.

97
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:07,256
Banished to a new country in Africa.
Hell, I had to look it up on a map.

98
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:12,641
My bishop doesn't know, but he's
given me exactly what I wanted:

99
00:09:12,976 --> 00:09:15,811
Elbow room. Freedom!

100
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:21,938
Real freedom. Freedom to dump
all the rules and all the trappings.

101
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,981
And freedom to discover God
in my own way.

102
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:28,942
Iâ€™d better be going.
I'll see you later.

103
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:31,827
John.

104
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,868
Still want me to give
that sermon this afternoon?

105
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:41,170
Well, one thing's for sure:
Nobody will sleep through it.

106
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,339
The weather report, sir.

107
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:48,959
"Weather moderate to the southeast.
Barometer 1016 millibars.

108
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,260
Smooth seas, clear skies. " Good.

109
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,887
Keep her on slow,
start taking on ballast.

110
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:55,305
Aye, sir.

111
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,222
Full ahead, captain.

112
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:05,642
As I've told you, we don't have
enough ballast yet to run full ahead.

113
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,401
I suggest we talk privately.

114
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,947
Linus, start taking on ballast.

115
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:17,363
I did not suggest full ahead, captain.

116
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,289
As the new owner's representative...

117
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:22,536
- ...I ordered it.
- Damn it, man...

118
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:26,295
...the Poseidon is too fine a lady
to be rushed to the junkyard.

119
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,342
We're three days behind schedule and
it's costing thousands of dollars...

120
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:34,087
...to maintain a wrecking crew.
We dock Monday!

121
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:36,805
I can't gamble with
my passengers' lives!

122
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,512
Your business is to deliver this ship
when and where we want it.

123
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:45,518
An unstable ship at full ahead is
dangerous. Especially one this old.

124
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:50,481
I'm sure I don't have to remind you
of my right to relieve your command.

125
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:54,242
Three other officers
have their master's license.

126
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:56,742
Now, order full ahead.

127
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,330
You irresponsible bastard.

128
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:08,292
Full ahead!

129
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:10,589
Aye, aye, sir.

130
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:52,086
Where did they come from?

131
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,713
They boarded at Gibraltar.
They're on their way to Sicily.

132
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:57,882
A free trip for free music.

133
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:00,383
They're going to a jazz festival.

134
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,848
Morning after

135
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,779
I can't take this.
Give me a Strauss waltz.

136
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:12,482
I rather fancy it.

137
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:15,277
You? You even fancy bagpipes.

138
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:18,075
Hey, did you know this?

139
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:21,329
The engines on this ship
have more total horsepower...

140
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,666
...than all the cavalry Napoleon
used to conquer Europe.

141
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,751
How about that?

142
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:29,245
That's heavy, Robin, real heavy.

143
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,128
The generator creates enough
electricity...

144
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,968
...to light Charleston, South Carolina,
and Atlanta, Georgia.

145
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:38,385
- Shelby?
- That's right.

146
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,431
- Cable.
- Thank you.

147
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:45,599
- It's my turn to open the cable.
- Don't be so childish.

148
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:52,478
"Mother and I waiting impatiently
your arrival.

149
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:57,274
Our thoughts and our love with you
on this New Year's Eve. Dad."

150
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:00,274
- We should've sent them a wire.
- I did.

151
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:04,914
Why didn't you ask me for my ideas?
I mean, what to put in it.

152
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,168
Why don't I have a brother
who's easier to live with?

153
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,418
- Stop jumping and go take a shower.
- I'm going to the engine room.

154
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,797
- You're going to church.
- On vacation?

155
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,387
- Will you get in that bathroom?
- I want to see the propeller shaft.

156
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,091
- You'll see the propeller shaft later.
- Why don't you shove it?

157
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,094
Don't you ever say that to me again.

158
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,517
Shove it, shove it, shove it.

159
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,480
God is pretty busy.

160
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,324
He has a plan for humanity that
stretches beyond our comprehension.

161
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:46,614
So we can't expect Him to concern
Himself with the individual.

162
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,792
The individual is important
only to the extent...

163
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:54,664
...of providing a creative link
between the past and the future...

164
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,588
...in his children,
or in his grandchildren...

165
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,713
...or his contributions to humanity.

166
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:07,352
Therefore, don't pray to God
to solve your problems.

167
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,150
Pray to that part of God within you.

168
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:16,233
Have the guts to fight for yourself.

169
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,277
God wants brave souls.

170
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:23,404
He wants winners, not quitters.

171
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:26,695
If you can't win, at least try to win.

172
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,950
God loves tryers.

173
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,875
- Isn't that right, Robin?
- Right.

174
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:40,090
So, what resolution should
we make for the New Year?

175
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:44,589
Resolve to let God know that
you have the guts to do it alone!

176
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,809
Resolve to fight for yourselves
and for others...

177
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:50,722
...and for those you love.

178
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:54,309
That part of God within you will
be fighting with you...

179
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:55,849
...all the way.

180
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:19,375
Do you know what it means to be picked
out from all the passengers...

181
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:23,679
...to sit at the captain's table
on New Year's Eve?

182
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,304
I'll tell you one thing it means.

183
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,307
That your worries about other women
looking down on you is bull.

184
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:36,016
He only invited us because
you're a detective lieutenant.

185
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,984
Why don't you just go without me?

186
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:42,441
What should I do at midnight,
kiss the captain?

187
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:44,317
Don't knock it.

188
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:51,865
Why don't you admit the real reason?

189
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,960
You're still afraid some bum
will recognize you.

190
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,044
That's pretty stupid!

191
00:15:57,464 --> 00:16:00,584
You're out of that business now.
You're my wife.

192
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:03,713
You can't go around afraid
all the time...

193
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,304
...that every guy you bump into
is a former customer!

194
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,432
Linda, you hear me?

195
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:14,054
Will you shut up? I'm busy in here!

196
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,568
You weren't on the streets that long!
How many guys did you know?

197
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,854
You realize how slim
the chances are...

198
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,399
...that even one of these characters
is on this boat?

199
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:28,950
You don't have to shout.

200
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,822
I said...

201
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:33,872
I said, do you realize how slim...

202
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,332
I heard what you said!

203
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:51,058
Mike.

204
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,932
I saw a young officer on deck
the other day.

205
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:00,436
And he looked pretty damn familiar.

206
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:02,812
Even with his clothes on.

207
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:14,288
So he recognized you.

208
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,083
So?

209
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:19,419
Doesn't that bother you?

210
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,545
If it bothered me, I wouldn't
have married you.

211
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:28,338
Well, first you arrested me six times!

212
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:32,767
I had to keep you off the streets
until you'd marry me!

213
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:51,400
Come here, you lousy cop.

214
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,070
Belle.

215
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:58,891
Mr. Martin, what is the
little green one for?

216
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:03,518
That's alfalfa, Mrs. Rosen.

217
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,690
It's essential to blood formation,
neural function and growth.

218
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:12,946
The growth part doesn't work.
At least not with me anyway.

219
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:18,330
And the yellow one?
That's very attractive.

220
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:22,534
A tocopherol, derived
from seed germ oil.

221
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:26,460
- It looks like vitamin E to me.
- It is, Mr. Rosen.

222
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,714
Doesn't that increase virility?

223
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,628
That's the rumor.

224
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,051
All you need is a pretty wife.

225
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:40,093
I think I've been a bachelor too long.

226
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:43,357
Sure, you're too busy
taking all those pills.

227
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:44,607
There she goes.

228
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:48,019
My wife can't stand seeing
anyone who's not married.

229
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:49,559
No.

230
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,860
- It comes from caring.
- I'd like to be married, Mrs. Rosen.

231
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:56,650
I just can't seem to find the time.

232
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:01,830
I mean, I get down to the shop
at 8, I open at 9.

233
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:04,290
I close at 7 and go home at 8.

234
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:08,878
Except on Wednesdays and Fridays,
I go home at 10.

235
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:11,749
Mrs. Rosen, when you
see your grandson...

236
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,217
...tell him not to become
a haberdasher.

237
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:15,965
I know what you mean.

238
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:20,007
We never went to Coney Island until
we sold our business last year.

239
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:21,389
You see?

240
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:23,436
Mr. Tinkham, are you married?

241
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,892
No marriage for me, Mrs. Rosen.
I've got a mistress.

242
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:29,730
- What?
- The sea.

243
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:32,228
Hey, that's good!

244
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:36,493
From the seismographic station
in Athens, sir.

245
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:42,163
"Sub-sea earthquake,
7.8 on the Richter scale.

246
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:46,413
Epicenter 130 miles
northwest of Crete."

247
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:58,301
That's the cat this ship
is named after?

248
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,882
That's right, the great god, Poseidon.

249
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:05,271
In Greek mythology, the god
of the seas, storms, tempests...

250
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:09,223
...earthquakes and other
miscellaneous natural disasters.

251
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,192
Quite an ill-tempered fellow.

252
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:13,603
- Yes?
- Sorry to disturb you, captain.

253
00:21:13,822 --> 00:21:15,696
- Please come to the bridge.
- Right.

254
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:19,451
Would you all excuse me, please?
Duty calls.

255
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:22,028
Reverend, do you mind
taking over as host?

256
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:24,365
- Glad to.
- Thank you.

257
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,542
Thank you, Acres.

258
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:36,253
- Oh, by the way, happy New Year!
- Thank you, sir.

259
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,425
Where you two heading?

260
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:43,715
Oh, Napoli, Roma, Venezia...

261
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,306
And don't forget Torino.

262
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:48,854
It's the first vacation
we've had since we got married.

263
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,061
And why we didn't fly,
I'll never know.

264
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:55,522
Well, since I'm in charge,
I'm gonna propose a toast.

265
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:59,158
Great. What will we drink to?

266
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:01,733
To love.

267
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,496
Hear, hear.

268
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:08,751
To love.

269
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:10,336
To love.

270
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:15,496
- To love, dummy.
- Oh.

271
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:19,095
Tell me, sir, just what
does a purser do?

272
00:22:19,346 --> 00:22:23,972
In spite of what you may have heard,
he really runs the ship.

273
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:26,847
Not the captain, the purser.

274
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,517
You see, the Poseidon
isn't really a ship.

275
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:33,100
It's a hotel with a bow
and a stern stuck on...

276
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,483
...and I'm the hotel manager.

277
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,072
Susan, would you like to dance?

278
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,233
- Hello, Susan?
- Hey, Sis!

279
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:45,287
I was just asking
if you'd like to dance.

280
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,366
Yes, I'd like to.

281
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,502
That's a frightening target, sir,
and getting closer.

282
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,886
Seismographic station, Athens, sir.

283
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:10,723
This is Captain Harrison,
S. S. Poseidon.

284
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:15,310
Can you give me any further reading
on that seaquake near Crete?

285
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:20,272
This is Athens. Epicenter 130 miles
northwest of Crete.

286
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:23,024
Duration 42 seconds.

287
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:28,154
One aftershock, 3. 6 on the Richter
scale, duration 10 seconds.

288
00:23:28,415 --> 00:23:31,369
First reports indicate a major
bottom displacement...

289
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:35,245
...and heavy swell conditions
building to the northeast, over.

290
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:41,173
This is the Poseidon. Thank you
for the information. Out.

291
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:47,844
- Are we all battened down?
- Tight as a button, sir.

292
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:57,399
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

293
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,236
It is exactly 50 seconds to midnight.

294
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,702
Will you all please stand
and fill your glasses?

295
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:22,342
Mr. Martin, don't be
by yourself tonight.

296
00:24:22,552 --> 00:24:24,426
Come, stand next to me.

297
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:26,216
Come on.

298
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,676
Ladies and gentlemen, silence.
Quiet, quiet, please.

299
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:35,181
Ten seconds, nine...

300
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,605
...eight, seven...

301
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:39,775
...six, five...

302
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:43,896
...four, three, two, one.

303
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:50,160
Happy New Year!

304
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,539
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

305
00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:16,019
It seems to be piling up
in those shallows.

306
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,725
- By the way, happy New Year.
- Thank you, sir, same to you.

307
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,440
- What's its speed?
- Sixty knots, sir.

308
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:24,863
It must be mountainous.

309
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,444
- Lookout, see anything?
- Nothing, sir.

310
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,569
- Radar target port bow. Keep watch.
- Yes, sir.

311
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,697
Get my binoculars.

312
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:20,367
Captain.

313
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:21,827
Lookout.

314
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:30,212
- What is it, lookout?
- On the port bow...

315
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:35,300
I never saw anything like it. An
enormous wall of water coming at us.

316
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,209
Oh, my God.

317
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,329
- Hard left!
- Hard left, sir.

318
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:05,171
Close all watertight doors!

319
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,503
Sound boat stations.

320
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:23,183
What the hell is happening?

321
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,570
- Sparks.
- Yes, sir.

322
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,771
Send a mayday.

323
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:32,529
- Mayday, sir?
- Yes, I said, mayday, mayday.

324
00:27:32,743 --> 00:27:34,486
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

325
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:36,536
This is S. S. Poseidon calling.

326
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,167
Manny! Manny!

327
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:33,794
Manny! Manny! No, Manny!

328
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:36,132
Manny!

329
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,973
Hold on, Linda!

330
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:32,043
- Manny.
- Belle.

331
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,542
- What?
- Belle.

332
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:35,299
Oh, Manny!

333
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,042
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

334
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,675
- You're not hurt?
- No, I don't think so.

335
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:49,638
- Jesus Christ, what happened?
- We've turned over.

336
00:30:55,445 --> 00:30:57,023
- It's okay.
- Linda?

337
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,780
- Linda, honey, you all right?
- Hi.

338
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:04,452
- Where the hell have you been?
- Where do you think?

339
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:06,531
Flying around on my ass.

340
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:31,094
Please...

341
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:33,805
...help me.

342
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:37,352
Help me, please.

343
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:17,318
Teddy?

344
00:32:18,612 --> 00:32:19,612
Ted?

345
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:36,044
Must go to the lifeboat stations.

346
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:39,833
Soon. Very soon.

347
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:42,499
Please...

348
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:47,306
...go to the lifeboat stations.

349
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:10,782
Listen to me, everybody!

350
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:16,578
I want you all to stay where you are.
Help will be here any minute.

351
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,380
This ship is equipped
with watertight compartments.

352
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,921
So just remain calm.

353
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:26,421
Keep your positions.
Help is on the way.

354
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:29,550
- Sis!
- Help is on the way.

355
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:31,798
Susan!

356
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:33,428
Susan!

357
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:36,854
- Robin, are you all right?
- Yes, sir. I'm all right.

358
00:33:37,107 --> 00:33:38,518
- But I can't...
- Robin?

359
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:40,186
Reverend Scott.

360
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,982
Can you help me?

361
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,196
What are you doing up there, Sis?

362
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,448
That's a stupid question!

363
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:52,162
- Are you hurt?
- I don't think so.

364
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:55,999
Just stay perfectly still.

365
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:57,449
You wait right here.

366
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:05,415
It'll be all right.
Hold on, Sis.

367
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:07,797
Over here, everybody!

368
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,089
Listen to me, give me some help.

369
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,593
Gather around.

370
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:13,932
Pull it tight. Let's make a net.

371
00:34:14,978 --> 00:34:16,307
Tuck it down tight.

372
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,775
All right, boys. Pull it tight.
That's it.

373
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,735
All right, hold on.

374
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,443
Come on, Susan!
Jump, we'll catch you!

375
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,652
I can't!

376
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:30,826
Don't be afraid! Jump!
Trust us!

377
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,658
Come on, you can make it, Sis!

378
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:37,701
Come on and jump, Susan!
You can make it.

379
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:40,741
Susan, you can do it.
Now, come on.

380
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:45,091
- It's a cinch. Come on!
- That's it, keep coming. Come on.

381
00:34:47,844 --> 00:34:49,671
Come on, jump!

382
00:34:58,146 --> 00:34:59,309
Sis!

383
00:34:59,523 --> 00:35:01,183
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

384
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,431
- Sis!
- Okay.

385
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:15,571
Listen to me, everybody!
Listen to me, please!

386
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,085
Please stay where you are!

387
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:22,455
Reverend Scott?

388
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,630
- Who is it?
- It's me, sir, Acres.

389
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:29,593
Could you help me down?
I've injured my leg.

390
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:32,252
Hang on, we'll get you down.
Grab that.

391
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:34,222
Pull it out. Grab hold.

392
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:37,048
Excuse me, Reverend,
my name's James Martin.

393
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:40,056
- Isn't it better to go up?
- What do you mean?

394
00:35:40,313 --> 00:35:43,813
It seems that any rescue would
have to come through the hull.

395
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:47,068
- The hull? You mean the bottom?
- My God, that's right.

396
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,562
We're upside down.
We've got to go up.

397
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,319
Acres, where's that lead to?

398
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:54,190
To the galley, sir.

399
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,694
- You stay there, we're coming up.
- Wait.

400
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,529
How do you figure going through
the bottom?

401
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,906
It's solid steel.

402
00:36:01,418 --> 00:36:04,372
Aft, sir, at the outlet of the
propeller shaft.

403
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,544
Kid, this isn't some toy boat,
so you let us figure it out, huh?

404
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,718
I'm sorry, sir, but Charley,
the third engineer...

405
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,838
...he told me that by the shaft,
the hull was only one-inch thick.

406
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:19,018
Look, do you know how thick
one inch of steel is?

407
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,392
It's one inch less than two inches.

408
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,137
We're climbing up! All of us!

409
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,983
Is there a ladder there,
or something we can climb with?

410
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:30,562
No, sir, this is
the linen service area.

411
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:34,446
- Tablecloths?
- Yes, sir.

412
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:37,827
- We can knot them together.
- Wouldn't be strong enough.

413
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
What we need is a...

414
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:43,163
Something like that,
the Christmas tree.

415
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:46,285
- Come on, give me a hand.
- No.

416
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:50,458
- You gonna give us a hand?
- No. Didn't you hear the purser?

417
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:53,920
He said to stay put and keep calm.
Help will be here.

418
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:57,554
- I'm staying right here.
- There he goes. That's my old man.

419
00:36:57,808 --> 00:36:59,681
- Linda.
- Everything by the book!

420
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:03,635
- You stay the hell out of this!
- You get your ass with us, mister.

421
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:05,477
Hey...

422
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:11,103
...watch your language, preacher.
You sound like you come from the slum!

423
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,854
You son of a bitch, go help him!

424
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:16,192
Okay, okay.

425
00:37:16,576 --> 00:37:18,818
Who the hell does he think he is?

426
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:21,327
Clear the way!
Come on, clear the way!

427
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:25,074
We're gonna lift on three.
Get over.

428
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:26,877
One! Two...

429
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:29,584
For God's sake, Reverend,
that's suicide!

430
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:34,467
We're cut off from the world.
Maybe we can get to them.

431
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:37,881
- Now, get out of the way.
- Pray for us but don't do this!

432
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,931
Climbing up will kill you all!

433
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:42,935
Sitting on our butts
isn't gonna help us either!

434
00:37:43,186 --> 00:37:45,760
Maybe by climbing up
we can save ourselves.

435
00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:49,723
You got any sense, you'll come too.
Grab hold. On three! One!

436
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:50,985
Two! Up!

437
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:53,864
Holy mackerel, it's heavy.

438
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:55,531
All right, forward!

439
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:11,870
Hold it!

440
00:38:16,386 --> 00:38:17,631
Let's upend it.

441
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:26,394
Bring it up to your waist.

442
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:30,559
Stand by, Acres!
Good for you, Mr. Rosen.

443
00:38:30,817 --> 00:38:33,024
All right, come on, everybody! Push!

444
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:35,271
- Come on, push!
- Get the bottom!

445
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,104
- Anchor the bottom!
- Keep it up now!

446
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,739
- Put some muscle into it!
- Be careful there.

447
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:43,819
- Keep it straight!
- All the way up!

448
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:45,409
All right, Reverend.

449
00:38:45,665 --> 00:38:47,290
- Come on, push!
- Come on!

450
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,749
- Come on, Rogo!
- Catch it, hold it!

451
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:52,043
Don't let it tip over!

452
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,672
- Good. Easy.
- That's it.

453
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,840
That's it. Acres, watch out.

454
00:38:57,052 --> 00:38:58,332
- Stand clear.
- We did it.

455
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:01,010
Acres, can you anchor it up there?

456
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:03,507
- Yeah, I think so, sir.
- Good man.

457
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:05,101
- Mr. Rosen.
- Yeah?

458
00:39:05,352 --> 00:39:06,550
Get your wife.

459
00:39:10,357 --> 00:39:13,026
- Are you all fixed up there, Acres?
- Yes, sir.

460
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:16,277
Let's start climbing up.

461
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:21,658
I need a monkey.

462
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:25,947
- Are you game?
- Yes, sir!

463
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:27,285
Good boy.

464
00:39:31,545 --> 00:39:33,751
Climb up inside as far as you can go.

465
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:37,130
Then come out and Mr. Acres
will give you a hand, okay?

466
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:38,759
No sweat.

467
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:14,417
It's a cinch! Come on!

468
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:17,880
- Now the rest of us.
- So you get us up there, then what?

469
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:21,300
Through the kitchen and deeper
until we reach the hull.

470
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:22,503
That way.

471
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:25,466
Then you kick out the bottom
and swim ashore, huh?

472
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:28,511
Or yell, "This is the police,"
and it'll open up.

473
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:31,224
- Don't be a smart-ass.
- Susan, you're first.

474
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,347
You can't climb in a gown,
so it'll have to come off. Okay?

475
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:42,021
Go up the same way Robin did...

476
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:44,441
- ...and don't look down.
- Okay.

477
00:40:45,702 --> 00:40:49,118
Excuse me, Reverend, what about
all those other people?

478
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:52,539
I'll keep them moving.
Try and get the others to join.

479
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:54,876
Okay, Miss Rogo, up you go.

480
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:58,004
- You have to take off the gown.
- Like hell she will!

481
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:01,875
- She can't climb in that, too tight.
- She's got nothing under it!

482
00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:04,383
Just panties. What else do I need?

483
00:41:04,638 --> 00:41:06,429
What do you mean, what else?

484
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:09,351
- Give her your shirt.
- My...

485
00:41:10,977 --> 00:41:11,977
Come on.

486
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:14,724
Linda...

487
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:18,689
...next time you put something on
like I told you to put on.

488
00:41:21,321 --> 00:41:24,073
- How you coming, Susan?
- All right!

489
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:30,109
Good girl.

490
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:33,950
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's very little time.

491
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:37,578
Please, everybody, you heard
what the reverend said...

492
00:41:37,921 --> 00:41:40,127
...he's taking us up
to the engine room.

493
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,045
- Please, everyone, come this way.
- Mr. Martin!

494
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,388
- We're staying right here.
- Can't you see the logic?

495
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,429
- What are you doing?
- I want you...

496
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:57,143
...to give this to our
little grandson, huh?

497
00:41:57,858 --> 00:41:59,934
Why? I'm going somewhere you're not?

498
00:42:00,736 --> 00:42:04,436
- Tell me something, Manny.
- What is it now?

499
00:42:04,698 --> 00:42:08,992
How long you think since we
told each other "I love you"?

500
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:13,408
Who knows?

501
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,373
Twenty years?

502
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,460
Yesterday?

503
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:20,879
I love you.

504
00:42:22,966 --> 00:42:25,374
Not many people have had that.

505
00:42:29,723 --> 00:42:32,558
Put it back on. You'll give
it to him yourself.

506
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:34,351
- No.
- Mrs. Rosen...

507
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:36,431
...we have to go right now.

508
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,852
Mr. Scott, a fat woman like me
can't climb.

509
00:42:42,903 --> 00:42:46,603
- I'll wait here with the others.
- I'm afraid I can't allow that.

510
00:42:46,907 --> 00:42:48,650
Listen to him, Belle.

511
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:52,408
There's something different up there
than there is down here?

512
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:54,366
Yes.

513
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,451
Life.

514
00:43:00,504 --> 00:43:01,879
Life is up there.

515
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:05,003
And life always matters very much...

516
00:43:05,634 --> 00:43:06,879
...doesn't it?

517
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,349
Yes.

518
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:17,931
All right, so I'll climb.

519
00:43:35,497 --> 00:43:37,537
Please, Ted.

520
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:39,370
You've got to wake up.

521
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:45,256
We've got something we've got to do.

522
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:49,332
You know how disorganized I am
without you.

523
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:52,504
- Wake up.
- Miss?

524
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:55,259
Miss?

525
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:05,565
I think you should come with me.

526
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:07,986
Leave him?

527
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:10,905
Oh, I can't.

528
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:14,446
I can't leave my brother.

529
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,953
He's all I've got.

530
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,406
What's your name?

531
00:44:23,336 --> 00:44:24,665
Nonnie.

532
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:28,626
Nonnie...

533
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:31,964
...your brother's dead.

534
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,279
Did you like his music?

535
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:52,614
I would have danced to it...

536
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:56,786
...if I'd had somebody to dance with.

537
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,872
Come, please.

538
00:45:05,253 --> 00:45:07,744
Come with me. Please.

539
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:12,343
- Come on, Belle.
- I can't!

540
00:45:12,594 --> 00:45:14,717
You can. It's just a little higher.

541
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:18,630
I can't, Manny, I'm stuck.
I'm stuck in the spokes!

542
00:45:18,934 --> 00:45:22,682
- Yes, you can.
- I can't, Manny!

543
00:45:23,063 --> 00:45:24,937
I can't!

544
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,686
What's happening? What is that?

545
00:45:30,946 --> 00:45:32,440
What's down there?

546
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,610
Good girl.

547
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:41,747
- Excuse me for getting so familiar.
- What else could you do?

548
00:45:41,998 --> 00:45:44,287
Mrs. Peter Pan, I'm not.

549
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:46,416
All right, Belle, let's get up.

550
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:48,538
Come on, come on.

551
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:50,832
That's it. There we go.

552
00:45:52,384 --> 00:45:53,499
You ready?

553
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:56,628
- Follow her.
- Wait a minute.

554
00:45:56,888 --> 00:46:00,589
- Don't you ever say "please"?
- If it'll get you up that tree...

555
00:46:00,851 --> 00:46:02,677
...please.

556
00:46:05,981 --> 00:46:08,139
This is Nonnie, she's coming with us.

557
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,807
- What about the others?
- Nobody will listen.

558
00:46:11,028 --> 00:46:13,945
They have more confidence
in the purser than in us.

559
00:46:21,747 --> 00:46:24,783
You help her up, Mr. Martin,
and then you follow her.

560
00:46:35,635 --> 00:46:38,755
You didn't say what you thought
of my sermon.

561
00:46:40,432 --> 00:46:43,137
- You didn't ask me.
- I'm asking you now.

562
00:46:47,022 --> 00:46:49,429
You spoke only for the strong.

563
00:46:50,317 --> 00:46:53,187
I'm asking you to be strong.
Come with us.

564
00:46:54,488 --> 00:46:56,694
I can't leave these people.

565
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,197
I know I can't save them.

566
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:01,694
I suspect we'll die...

567
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:05,413
...but I can't leave them.

568
00:47:09,711 --> 00:47:11,503
They don't want to go.

569
00:47:11,713 --> 00:47:14,418
They've chosen to stay.
Why should you?

570
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:16,800
What good's your life then?

571
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:18,796
What's it all been for?

572
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:37,568
I have no other choice.

573
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,291
John, I'm not gonna give up.

574
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:55,881
Can I have your attention?

575
00:47:56,758 --> 00:47:59,047
May I have your attention, please?

576
00:48:02,973 --> 00:48:04,171
That's the way out.

577
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:08,562
- That's our only chance.
- Don't listen to him!

578
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:11,729
- We must stay until help arrives.
- Help from where?

579
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:15,561
From the captain? He's dead.

580
00:48:15,819 --> 00:48:18,855
Everyone above us before the ship
turned over is dead.

581
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:21,361
Because now they're under the water.

582
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:25,117
- That's not true!
- It is true, you pompous ass!

583
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:27,864
There's nobody alive but us!

584
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:31,160
And nobody's going to help us
except ourselves.

585
00:48:31,918 --> 00:48:35,750
It's up to each one of you.
It's up to all of us. Together.

586
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:38,207
Now, for God's sake, come with me.

587
00:48:38,508 --> 00:48:40,465
I order you not to go!

588
00:48:40,761 --> 00:48:42,800
He knows nothing about this ship.

589
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:45,343
- He's right.
- Mind your own business!

590
00:48:53,065 --> 00:48:55,353
- God bless.
- God bless you.

591
00:48:57,819 --> 00:48:59,100
Here, sir. Here, sir.

592
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:03,032
Here you are.

593
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:27,342
- I appeal to you for the last time.
- You don't know what you're saying!

594
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,058
I know this much:

595
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:31,468
The sea will keep pouring in.

596
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:34,480
We'll keep settling deeper.
We may even go under...

597
00:49:34,731 --> 00:49:36,439
...before we cut our way out.

598
00:49:36,692 --> 00:49:39,562
But it's a chance.
We might make it.

599
00:49:40,737 --> 00:49:42,694
If you stay here, you'll die!

600
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:45,825
We are staying with the purser!

601
00:49:57,713 --> 00:50:02,291
- Couldn't talk anybody else into it?
- We're on our own. Let's get inside.

602
00:50:11,727 --> 00:50:13,185
Get them inside! Get in!

603
00:50:36,126 --> 00:50:37,917
Let's get to the tree!

604
00:50:42,716 --> 00:50:43,716
Hold it!

605
00:50:46,303 --> 00:50:47,583
One at a time!

606
00:50:48,055 --> 00:50:51,305
- Don't panic!
- Goddamn it, get off my back!

607
00:50:52,768 --> 00:50:54,926
Don't panic! One at a time!

608
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:58,057
Get off my hand!

609
00:50:58,315 --> 00:51:00,984
One at a time! Take it easy!

610
00:51:03,153 --> 00:51:06,771
Give me your hand, Reverend!
Give me your hand!

611
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:16,743
I'm going under! Help me, help me!
I'm going under!

612
00:51:27,511 --> 00:51:28,839
I'm going under!

613
00:51:29,096 --> 00:51:33,639
I'm going under!
Help me, help me! Please!

614
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:44,269
Oh, my God! I don't want to die!
Please help me! Please!

615
00:51:44,486 --> 00:51:46,977
Don't hang on me! Help me!

616
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,293
Which way to the kitchen, Acres?

617
00:52:05,257 --> 00:52:06,799
This way, sir.

618
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:14,598
What is that?

619
00:52:15,267 --> 00:52:16,346
Fire, sir.

620
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:21,183
- That's a special fire door, eh?
- Yes, sir. It's a safety door.

621
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,643
- It closes at high temperature, right?
- Yes, sir.

622
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:28,899
So any fire would be out of oxygen...
Smothered, wouldn't it?

623
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:31,403
- That's the theory, sir.
- Let's test it.

624
00:52:33,952 --> 00:52:36,953
- Get them to stand away from the door.
- Hold it!

625
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,738
Do you know what a flash fire is?

626
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,743
I won't let you kill us!

627
00:52:42,002 --> 00:52:43,911
I'm going through that door, Mr. Rogo.

628
00:52:44,129 --> 00:52:48,625
You can either close that door
behind me or try to stop me.

629
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:51,628
Now, what's it gonna be?

630
00:52:57,225 --> 00:53:02,053
I always thought I was gonna catch it
in some tenement by some criminal.

631
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:05,183
Okay, open it.

632
00:53:05,901 --> 00:53:08,226
Move back against
the bulkhead, please.

633
00:53:08,487 --> 00:53:11,060
Would you move back?
Thank you. Over there.

634
00:53:16,203 --> 00:53:17,282
Here.

635
00:53:32,928 --> 00:53:34,755
Get back! Go on!
Get back, all of you!

636
00:54:57,637 --> 00:55:02,098
Excuse me, Mr. Rogo.
What if he doesn't come back?

637
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:04,142
So, how the hell do I know?

638
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:09,273
Well, we have to do something.
We have to formulate some plan.

639
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,733
Meanwhile, what do I tell the others?

640
00:55:13,987 --> 00:55:17,605
Tell them to bring out their
hymn books and start singing.

641
00:55:17,824 --> 00:55:19,283
Get back! Get back!

642
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,651
Okay.

643
00:55:22,913 --> 00:55:24,704
- Okay, what?
- Acres.

644
00:55:24,956 --> 00:55:27,874
Where does the companionway
by the kitchen lead to?

645
00:55:29,211 --> 00:55:31,618
Down to... Up to Broadway, sir.

646
00:55:32,005 --> 00:55:35,540
- What's Broadway?
- Service way that runs along the ship.

647
00:55:35,801 --> 00:55:37,840
Does it lead to the engine room?

648
00:55:39,096 --> 00:55:44,054
I don't know much about below deck
but there might be access from there.

649
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:45,301
There is!

650
00:55:45,401 --> 00:55:47,018
- You again?
- Sorry, sir.

651
00:55:47,229 --> 00:55:49,850
Robin, how do you know about Broadway?

652
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,432
I went there with my engineer friend.

653
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:55,771
He called it Broadway
when he took me to the boilers.

654
00:55:56,405 --> 00:55:57,567
That's it then.

655
00:55:57,823 --> 00:56:00,230
- You're taking his word for it?
- Why not?

656
00:56:00,492 --> 00:56:04,490
- He's just a kid!
- Mrs. Rosen, no more Christmas trees.

657
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:06,788
I'd be grateful.

658
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:10,037
- Can you make it, Acres?
- Oh, yes, sir.

659
00:56:10,293 --> 00:56:11,456
I'm fine, sir. Fine.

660
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:14,291
- Get your brother.
- Nonnie, come on.

661
00:56:14,548 --> 00:56:16,457
- Belle, we have to go.
- Let's go.

662
00:56:18,677 --> 00:56:21,962
There's a lot of dead bodies in there.

663
00:56:22,222 --> 00:56:24,547
Don't touch anything, it's hot.

664
00:56:36,737 --> 00:56:40,319
No! Manny, the fire will burn us.
We'll go back!

665
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:44,903
For 30 years you've given the orders,
now obey mine. We're going through!

666
00:56:45,162 --> 00:56:46,241
I'll take care of you!

667
00:57:34,669 --> 00:57:37,125
Acres, is this the only way?

668
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:38,834
Yes, sir.

669
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:52,133
We'll need something
to pull you up with.

670
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,202
Reverend, try this.

671
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:22,714
Acres, you first. I need you.

672
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,802
Rogo, give him a hand.

673
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:27,376
Rogo, Rogo, Rogo.

674
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,715
Mr. Rogo, put this around his waist.

675
00:58:43,447 --> 00:58:47,444
What I don't like about you, Scott,
is your attitude.

676
00:58:47,701 --> 00:58:48,863
Or is it deeper?

677
00:58:49,494 --> 00:58:53,444
Maybe we're two of a kind and
you don't like looking at yourself.

678
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,036
Through those doors?

679
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:59,709
Oh, no, that's the crew's galley.
It's...

680
00:59:00,714 --> 00:59:02,422
It's that way, sir.

681
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,337
- Get the rest of them.
- Yes, sir.

682
00:59:07,471 --> 00:59:08,881
Thank you, sir.

683
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,430
All right, grab ahold of this.

684
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:19,222
- I'm surprised the lights still work.
- Emergency circuit and batteries.

685
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:22,152
Supposed to stay operational
for three hours.

686
00:59:22,402 --> 00:59:23,896
They better.

687
00:59:25,655 --> 00:59:27,031
Oh, God.

688
00:59:33,497 --> 00:59:37,245
- Well?
- There's no other exit from this area.

689
00:59:37,459 --> 00:59:39,333
There's gotta be. Think.

690
00:59:41,463 --> 00:59:43,087
You're all right, Belle.

691
00:59:43,298 --> 00:59:44,958
Go ahead, pull.

692
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:50,805
It's okay, Mrs. Rosen.

693
00:59:51,014 --> 00:59:54,513
I helped my dad pull in a 600-pound
swordfish off Hawaii.

694
00:59:59,898 --> 01:00:01,013
There.

695
01:00:05,654 --> 01:00:06,733
That's it, sir...

696
01:00:06,988 --> 01:00:10,607
...down there. Right there.
I think that's it, sir.

697
01:00:37,686 --> 01:00:41,055
- This leads to the central shaft?
- It's what I've been told.

698
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:58,156
- Where does it lead to?
- I think there's exits on all decks...

699
01:00:58,410 --> 01:00:59,524
...like this one.

700
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:03,036
- It doesn't look very promising.
- No, it doesn't.

701
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,282
Okay, up you go.

702
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:16,131
The water's coming in!
The water's coming in!

703
01:01:19,848 --> 01:01:22,303
- There, grab it!
- The water's coming in!

704
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:24,304
Shut up!

705
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:27,396
Come on, get up this goddamn ramp!

706
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:30,648
We all can't be as composed
as you are, Mrs. Rogo.

707
01:01:31,443 --> 01:01:33,020
Come on up here.

708
01:01:33,445 --> 01:01:35,817
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Get the hose down here.

709
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:37,360
All right, grab it!

710
01:01:39,242 --> 01:01:40,950
- Bring it down.
- Come on!

711
01:01:41,578 --> 01:01:44,365
- Pull! Pull!
- Get up.

712
01:01:44,623 --> 01:01:46,283
Don't panic, don't panic!

713
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,035
All right, all right.

714
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:49,282
- Rogo.
- Yeah?

715
01:01:49,502 --> 01:01:52,040
- Bring them this way.
- Everybody down this way.

716
01:01:52,297 --> 01:01:55,997
It's crazy. We're sinking!
Nothing will keep us from drowning!

717
01:01:56,259 --> 01:01:57,837
- Keep moving!
- He's right.

718
01:01:58,053 --> 01:02:01,920
- There are air pockets everywhere.
- Air pockets?

719
01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:03,223
Yes.

720
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:06,801
That last deck flooding
doesn't mean this one will.

721
01:02:08,813 --> 01:02:11,814
- How long will we stay afloat?
- Long enough.

722
01:02:12,025 --> 01:02:15,061
Andrea Doria stayed afloat
10 hours before sinking.

723
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,989
You see, we've got a long time to go.

724
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,650
Come on, keep moving.

725
01:02:20,242 --> 01:02:22,483
This duct leads to
a vertical air shaft.

726
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:24,703
Through that little hole?

727
01:02:24,955 --> 01:02:27,659
This little hole will get us
up to Broadway.

728
01:02:28,124 --> 01:02:30,450
We've climbed four decks,
two more to go.

729
01:02:31,086 --> 01:02:35,415
- This is the only way.
- You expect a person to fit in there?

730
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,925
Mrs. Rosen, you'll crawl
through there, believe me.

731
01:02:39,177 --> 01:02:42,261
She has this illusion.
Always thinking she's too fat.

732
01:02:43,515 --> 01:02:46,966
- Rogo, follow me.
- I figured. It's me again, huh?

733
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:48,394
Why?

734
01:02:48,645 --> 01:02:52,310
I'll need you when we get
to the other end of this duct.

735
01:02:53,525 --> 01:02:55,897
- Mr. Martin!
- Yes, sir?

736
01:02:56,152 --> 01:02:59,023
See that everyone gets in
and follow at the rear.

737
01:02:59,281 --> 01:03:00,526
Oh, okay, Reverend.

738
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:02,700
I'm going next...

739
01:03:02,951 --> 01:03:05,323
..so if old fat-ass
gets stuck in there...

740
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:08,116
...I won't be caught behind her.

741
01:03:09,499 --> 01:03:11,871
Come on, kids, you're next.

742
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:19,789
Manny...

743
01:03:20,051 --> 01:03:22,922
...if I get stuck, push.

744
01:03:23,138 --> 01:03:25,380
Don't worry, you won't get stuck.

745
01:03:27,392 --> 01:03:29,385
Watch your head.

746
01:03:30,562 --> 01:03:32,104
That's it.

747
01:03:33,106 --> 01:03:35,562
- Okay, Nonnie, you're next.
- No, with you.

748
01:03:35,817 --> 01:03:37,098
With you.

749
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:39,941
- Mr. Acres, would you, please?
- Yes, sir.

750
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:42,522
Come, we don't want
to lose the others.

751
01:03:42,782 --> 01:03:44,822
You'll be right behind me?

752
01:03:49,664 --> 01:03:53,164
Like two peas in a pod.
Quickly!

753
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:44,502
Hello!

754
01:04:46,638 --> 01:04:48,049
Hey!

755
01:04:48,515 --> 01:04:49,974
Hey!

756
01:04:51,643 --> 01:04:53,303
Hey, in there!

757
01:04:55,689 --> 01:04:58,690
You follow me. And don't look down.

758
01:04:58,942 --> 01:05:00,769
Easy does it. Come on.

759
01:05:00,986 --> 01:05:03,274
Get your foot up on the ladder.
That's it.

760
01:05:03,905 --> 01:05:06,823
Go ahead, you're all right.
Go ahead, honey.

761
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:19,328
I said, don't look down!

762
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:22,582
Okay, okay.

763
01:05:29,931 --> 01:05:31,639
Thattagirl. Take it easy.

764
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:51,317
This must be it! Bring them up!

765
01:06:06,968 --> 01:06:09,257
Don't lose your footing.
Your turn, kid.

766
01:06:09,471 --> 01:06:11,262
Give Mrs. Rosen a hand.

767
01:06:11,973 --> 01:06:13,717
All right, come on.

768
01:06:13,934 --> 01:06:16,507
- How you doing, Mrs. Rosen?
- Fine.

769
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:20,981
I think I'm getting my second wind.
How are you doing, Mr. Rogo?

770
01:06:21,233 --> 01:06:22,940
Fine, fine.

771
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,313
Don't mind that. Don't mind that.

772
01:06:29,032 --> 01:06:31,321
- Just look up.
- Manny, are you there?

773
01:06:31,576 --> 01:06:34,411
- Where else could I be?
- Mrs. Rosen....

774
01:06:34,621 --> 01:06:37,491
I didn't mean it
to sound the way it did.

775
01:06:37,707 --> 01:06:38,822
I miss something?

776
01:06:39,209 --> 01:06:41,878
When I told you
about Dad's 600-pound swordfish...

777
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:44,838
...I didn't mean that
you weighed that much.

778
01:06:45,548 --> 01:06:49,048
With all that's happening,
that's what you're worried about?

779
01:06:49,261 --> 01:06:50,541
Sure. What else?

780
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:52,929
You're a good boy.

781
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:54,847
Tell my sister.

782
01:06:55,058 --> 01:06:56,718
Watch your leg now.

783
01:07:02,399 --> 01:07:05,602
It's all right, Mrs. Rosen, come on.

784
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,438
I'm coming.

785
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:22,579
Press against my back. Push.

786
01:07:33,513 --> 01:07:36,799
- You go first.
- All right, Mrs. Rosen.

787
01:07:37,058 --> 01:07:40,510
But don't... Don't go too fast.

788
01:07:40,812 --> 01:07:43,018
Manny, are you behind me?

789
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:45,515
You haven't lost me yet.

790
01:07:49,362 --> 01:07:50,738
Up you go.

791
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:52,603
Up, up.

792
01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:11,022
Keep it moving!

793
01:09:11,236 --> 01:09:12,979
Nonnie, you all right?

794
01:09:19,244 --> 01:09:20,655
I'm sorry.

795
01:09:20,912 --> 01:09:22,537
I can't move.

796
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:24,164
I can't.

797
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:28,326
Nonnie, keep your eyes on the ladder.

798
01:09:29,045 --> 01:09:31,371
Don't look at anything
except the ladder.

799
01:09:31,631 --> 01:09:34,632
I'm right here. I'm with you.
Do you understand?

800
01:09:34,884 --> 01:09:40,009
All right, now, one rung at a time.
Just reach up your hand.

801
01:09:40,265 --> 01:09:44,594
Now, don't think of anything
but the ladder. Go ahead, Nonnie.

802
01:09:44,894 --> 01:09:49,272
Come on, what are you doing up there,
taking a coffee break? Move it!

803
01:09:49,524 --> 01:09:51,683
Please, Mr. Rogo.

804
01:09:52,694 --> 01:09:56,063
All right, Nonnie, now your foot.

805
01:09:56,531 --> 01:09:57,776
Step up.

806
01:09:58,033 --> 01:09:59,408
Step up.

807
01:09:59,868 --> 01:10:01,066
That's it.

808
01:10:01,494 --> 01:10:02,526
That's it.

809
01:10:02,787 --> 01:10:05,741
That's the one.
The first rung's the tough one.

810
01:10:05,957 --> 01:10:10,500
Now again. Now again.
Once more. That's it.

811
01:10:10,754 --> 01:10:13,126
All right. One rung at a time now.

812
01:10:14,549 --> 01:10:17,467
Now your foot. Now your foot.

813
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:20,044
Keep going. That's it.

814
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:22,968
Okay. Now the next rung.

815
01:10:26,102 --> 01:10:29,020
Those terrible explosions.

816
01:10:29,397 --> 01:10:32,813
- What's happening?
- It's all right. It's all right.

817
01:10:33,026 --> 01:10:34,734
We're still afloat.

818
01:10:34,945 --> 01:10:36,320
Look!

819
01:10:39,866 --> 01:10:42,155
My God! There are others still alive!

820
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:49,659
You stay here. Help the others out.
I'll see where they're going.

821
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:54,661
- Where you going?
- We're following the doctor.

822
01:10:54,881 --> 01:10:56,340
Doctor!

823
01:10:56,591 --> 01:11:00,209
You're going the wrong way.
You're going toward the bow.

824
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,845
That's right, Reverend.

825
01:11:02,055 --> 01:11:04,676
Wait a minute.
You can't get out that end.

826
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:07,382
- Why not?
- Because we're settling by the bow.

827
01:11:07,602 --> 01:11:08,847
The bow's underwater.

828
01:11:09,104 --> 01:11:12,058
Go to the stern.
We'll exit through the engine room.

829
01:11:12,274 --> 01:11:13,982
- It's gone.
- How do you know?

830
01:11:14,234 --> 01:11:18,860
The explosions. You must've felt them.
The only way out is forward!

831
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:24,738
Did you check the engine room?
Did you see it?

832
01:11:24,995 --> 01:11:27,236
I don't have to. We're going forward.

833
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:30,114
Please, come with us, Reverend.

834
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:36,372
You're going the wrong way, damn it!

835
01:11:45,849 --> 01:11:46,880
We lost Acres.

836
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,808
In the shaft. He fell.

837
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:52,638
Where in the hell were you?

838
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,976
What's that supposed to mean?

839
01:11:57,444 --> 01:12:00,361
I told you to keep
everybody rounded up!

840
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:04,320
- Mr. Rogo did the best he could...
- You don't have to defend me.

841
01:12:04,701 --> 01:12:09,778
I've had just about enough from you.
Who do you think you are, God Himself?

842
01:12:10,165 --> 01:12:13,082
- He was hurt and needed protection!
- So he was hurt!

843
01:12:13,543 --> 01:12:16,663
The boat tilted and he fell!
The shaft blew up!

844
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,091
He's dead. That's it! Or do you
want to make something more out of it?

845
01:12:21,801 --> 01:12:25,005
I said I'd get everybody out
and, goddamn it, I'll do it!

846
01:12:25,221 --> 01:12:28,721
Mr. Scott, all those other people,
where were they going?

847
01:12:31,102 --> 01:12:32,894
They're going toward the bow.

848
01:12:33,396 --> 01:12:36,148
But they're wrong.
The bow's underwater!

849
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:39,353
How do you know?! Have you seen it?!

850
01:12:39,569 --> 01:12:42,107
What makes you so damn sure
about everything?

851
01:12:42,739 --> 01:12:45,111
If all those people
think they're right...

852
01:12:45,325 --> 01:12:47,614
...maybe we should go with them!
Not you!

853
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:49,619
That's brilliant!

854
01:12:49,871 --> 01:12:52,955
Twenty people decide to drown,
so that's all right.

855
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:55,913
That's typical.
Everything by numbers...

856
01:12:57,379 --> 01:13:00,830
- Stop it, Mike!
- He's been right so far.

857
01:13:01,883 --> 01:13:04,967
Wait a minute.
May I make a suggestion, please?

858
01:13:05,178 --> 01:13:08,345
We'd feel more secure
if you two would stop fighting!

859
01:13:08,765 --> 01:13:11,054
Well, what do you want us to do?

860
01:13:11,643 --> 01:13:13,766
I'm gonna make a deal with you.

861
01:13:14,896 --> 01:13:17,933
I'm gonna go to the stern,
to the engine room.

862
01:13:18,191 --> 01:13:21,726
And if it's passable,
we're gonna do it my way!

863
01:13:21,945 --> 01:13:24,946
If not, we'll go forward.
You got it?!

864
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,157
Preacher!

865
01:13:34,749 --> 01:13:36,659
You got 15 minutes.

866
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:41,088
If you're not back here in 15 minutes,
we're going the other way.

867
01:13:45,635 --> 01:13:47,213
You're on.

868
01:14:01,192 --> 01:14:04,063
Wouldn't it be a good idea
to look around...

869
01:14:04,321 --> 01:14:08,235
...try to find things we might need,
like food or something?

870
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:10,283
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Good.

871
01:14:10,493 --> 01:14:13,660
All right. Start looking, everyone,
but stay in the area.

872
01:14:13,872 --> 01:14:15,366
Nonnie, let's take a look.

873
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:19,366
Manny, wait a second.
I want to ask you something.

874
01:14:19,628 --> 01:14:21,620
I'll follow Mr. Scott. Stay here.

875
01:14:21,838 --> 01:14:24,294
No way. I'm gonna help find things.

876
01:14:24,549 --> 01:14:26,957
Okay, but don't stray too far.

877
01:14:31,056 --> 01:14:33,843
Manny, have you still
got your handkerchief?

878
01:14:35,393 --> 01:14:37,185
It's not very clean.

879
01:15:35,412 --> 01:15:37,239
Reverend Scott.

880
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:41,833
Mr. Scott.

881
01:15:43,086 --> 01:15:44,960
Why aren't you with the others?

882
01:15:47,215 --> 01:15:48,246
I'm scared.

883
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,797
I feel safer with you.

884
01:16:07,652 --> 01:16:10,190
You will get us
out of here, won't you?

885
01:16:11,615 --> 01:16:14,781
Oh, you bet I am, Susan.
You bet I am.

886
01:16:17,787 --> 01:16:22,533
We can't get out this way. But we
went by a lot of other passages.

887
01:16:22,792 --> 01:16:26,660
We'll look down every single one
until we find that engine room.

888
01:16:28,214 --> 01:16:29,792
Okay.

889
01:16:30,508 --> 01:16:31,884
Okay, come on.

890
01:16:33,094 --> 01:16:37,222
We're never gonna see
our little grandson, are we?

891
01:16:37,474 --> 01:16:40,344
Now, darling,
you have to think positively.

892
01:16:40,602 --> 01:16:42,927
We'll see him. We'll see him.

893
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:50,231
If any of us are saved,
I hope it's those two children.

894
01:16:50,654 --> 01:16:53,655
They still have their whole lives
in front of them.

895
01:16:53,865 --> 01:16:56,154
Stop giving our lives away.

896
01:16:56,368 --> 01:17:00,946
We'll come out of this. All of us.
Now you just sit here while l...

897
01:17:01,164 --> 01:17:02,243
Manny...

898
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:06,080
...you are a good man.

899
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,831
You're such a good man.

900
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,812
- Promise me something.
- Depends. What?

901
01:18:07,022 --> 01:18:10,770
If I'm not back in five minutes,
tell the others that I was wrong.

902
01:18:10,984 --> 01:18:13,522
Tell Mr. Rogo to do it his way.
Understand?

903
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:15,980
I promise, but you'll be back!

904
01:18:17,073 --> 01:18:18,449
I'll be back.

905
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,523
Look at that.
A whole new idea of cutting hair.

906
01:18:58,782 --> 01:19:03,609
Strap the customer in, push a button,
raise him up, flip him over...

907
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:06,408
...let his hair hang down
and snip, snip, snip.

908
01:19:06,623 --> 01:19:08,912
Yeah, snip, snip, snip.

909
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:11,830
My brother, Teddy, has lovely hair.

910
01:19:18,969 --> 01:19:21,008
He's really dead...

911
01:19:22,889 --> 01:19:24,549
...isn't he?

912
01:19:27,727 --> 01:19:30,349
I can't go on without him.

913
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:32,898
I can't.

914
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:37,069
Nonnie...

915
01:19:37,862 --> 01:19:39,772
...you will go on.

916
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:42,067
We do, you know.

917
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:44,367
We have to.

918
01:19:52,294 --> 01:19:55,627
At first we don't think
it's possible...

919
01:19:56,965 --> 01:20:00,630
...but in time, believe me, in time...

920
01:20:00,844 --> 01:20:04,379
...you'll find other things,
other people.

921
01:20:04,806 --> 01:20:07,926
Someone else to care for. You'll see.

922
01:20:51,144 --> 01:20:53,717
- Brandy, rope, axe.
- We found these.

923
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:57,349
Good, good. Well, it's 17 minutes
and he ain't back.

924
01:20:57,567 --> 01:20:59,061
- Sixteen minutes.
- Let's go.

925
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:03,364
- Can't we wait a few minutes longer?
- What for?

926
01:21:03,573 --> 01:21:05,815
We're gonna move that way and fast.

927
01:21:06,076 --> 01:21:07,653
Mr. Rogo!

928
01:21:08,954 --> 01:21:11,575
- What's wrong? Where were you?
- With Mr. Scott.

929
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:15,159
We found a hatch he thought
might lead to the engine room.

930
01:21:15,377 --> 01:21:19,873
So he told me if he wasn't back
in five minutes to tell you...

931
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:23,624
- ...to do it your way.
- Come on, kid, pull yourself together.

932
01:21:23,885 --> 01:21:26,922
Goddamn it, that does it!
We've been wasting time...

933
01:21:27,138 --> 01:21:29,926
...while we should have gone
up front with the rest.

934
01:21:30,225 --> 01:21:35,101
Wait! After all he's done for us,
we can't leave without him.

935
01:21:35,313 --> 01:21:37,685
- You act as if he's already dead.
- I agree.

936
01:21:37,899 --> 01:21:39,975
He made a deal!
We're sticking to it!

937
01:21:40,193 --> 01:21:43,527
We're going up front right now!
Let's move it!

938
01:21:43,738 --> 01:21:46,988
I found it! I've been there.

939
01:21:48,827 --> 01:21:52,527
Do you hear me, Rogo? I've seen
the engine room and the way out.

940
01:21:53,206 --> 01:21:57,286
And it's this way. To use your words,
"Let's move it!" Come on.

941
01:21:57,502 --> 01:22:00,123
Robin? Wait, where's Robin?

942
01:22:00,547 --> 01:22:02,789
Last time I saw him, he went that way.

943
01:22:03,008 --> 01:22:07,420
Wait, Susan, you take everybody
to the hatch. I'll find Robin.

944
01:22:07,637 --> 01:22:11,386
- I can't without him.
- Will you trust me, huh?

945
01:22:12,892 --> 01:22:16,807
You're the only one who knows
where the hatch is. I'll find Robin.

946
01:22:18,148 --> 01:22:20,935
- That poor little boy.
- Keep going, he'll find him.

947
01:22:31,494 --> 01:22:33,119
Robin, come here!

948
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,658
In here. Up that ladder.

949
01:22:52,349 --> 01:22:55,385
- All right. Up you go.
- Not without my brother.

950
01:22:55,977 --> 01:22:57,222
- Up you go.
- Wait.

951
01:22:57,437 --> 01:22:59,762
- Get up there.
- Robin!

952
01:23:01,816 --> 01:23:03,311
Oh, my God.

953
01:23:19,376 --> 01:23:21,036
Get him up here!

954
01:23:25,423 --> 01:23:27,712
Get up there, boy. Get up there.

955
01:23:43,483 --> 01:23:45,476
Sorry, Sis, had to go to the john.

956
01:23:45,694 --> 01:23:50,652
- What a dumb, stupid way to die!
- I said, I'm sorry!

957
01:23:55,036 --> 01:23:56,993
- Where do we go now?
- Down!

958
01:23:57,205 --> 01:23:58,949
Close that watertight door!

959
01:23:59,165 --> 01:24:01,787
Down? That can't be.
I've been keeping track.

960
01:24:02,002 --> 01:24:05,205
We've come up eight decks.
Each deck we passed flooded.

961
01:24:05,422 --> 01:24:09,004
Not the engine room.
I've seen it. We go down!

962
01:24:24,649 --> 01:24:26,772
This is no goddamn engine room!

963
01:24:27,527 --> 01:24:29,021
Where the hell are we?

964
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:31,568
That corridor leads
to the engine room.

965
01:24:31,781 --> 01:24:35,281
- But now it's underwater.
- So we'll swim. Give me the rope.

966
01:24:35,535 --> 01:24:37,777
- You're kidding!
- She's right.

967
01:24:37,996 --> 01:24:40,569
The engine room's
probably underwater too.

968
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:44,456
It's in the clear. It's one deck up.
I saw it. It's above us.

969
01:24:44,961 --> 01:24:49,504
I'll swim up a companionway.
It's not more than 35 feet.

970
01:24:49,758 --> 01:24:51,168
Oh, is that all?

971
01:24:51,384 --> 01:24:52,962
We can do it. Believe me.

972
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:55,676
I'll tie the rope on the other end.

973
01:24:55,889 --> 01:24:59,803
When I get there, I'll give a tug.
Pull yourself along the rope.

974
01:25:00,018 --> 01:25:03,019
Take a deep breath.
It can't be more than 30 seconds.

975
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:06,017
- How long can you hold your breath?
- I don't know.

976
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:07,810
Do me a favor. Try it now.

977
01:25:08,026 --> 01:25:10,232
- Mr. Rogo, time him.
- Go ahead.

978
01:25:10,487 --> 01:25:15,113
Look at this. I was the underwater
swimming champ of New York...

979
01:25:15,325 --> 01:25:19,157
...for three years. I held
my breath for 2 minutes 47 seconds.

980
01:25:19,371 --> 01:25:22,325
- Let me do this, please.
- You were 17 then.

981
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:25,707
You've all been dragging
and pulling me all this way.

982
01:25:25,919 --> 01:25:28,920
Now I have a chance to do something
I know how to do.

983
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:31,419
Please, may I do this for everybody?

984
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:36,176
I'm perfectly capable of holding
my breath long enough to swim 35 feet.

985
01:25:39,391 --> 01:25:40,553
Thank you.

986
01:25:41,685 --> 01:25:43,060
Hey, hey, preacher.

987
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:45,972
Take a deep breath.

988
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:33,689
- Anybody timing him?
- I am.

989
01:26:33,904 --> 01:26:37,652
He's swimming through corridors
and up and down stairwells.

990
01:26:37,866 --> 01:26:40,571
I'm the only one here
trained to do that.

991
01:26:40,785 --> 01:26:41,817
Will you shut up!

992
01:26:42,037 --> 01:26:44,444
What makes you think you can do it?

993
01:26:44,664 --> 01:26:48,116
You can ask anybody
in the Women's Swimming Association.

994
01:26:48,335 --> 01:26:52,961
Just because I put on a little weight
doesn't mean I wasn't once an athlete.

995
01:26:53,173 --> 01:26:55,746
- What time now?
- 39 seconds.

996
01:27:17,572 --> 01:27:19,814
- What?
- The rope's not going through!

997
01:27:20,033 --> 01:27:22,322
- Maybe he's there.
- Give him more time.

998
01:27:22,535 --> 01:27:24,327
He said he'd tug on the rope.

999
01:27:27,415 --> 01:27:30,085
What'll we do, goddamn it?
What'll we do?

1000
01:27:30,293 --> 01:27:33,164
Pull him back. Pull him back!

1001
01:27:33,797 --> 01:27:37,130
Give, you son of a bitch! Give!

1002
01:27:37,717 --> 01:27:38,880
Belle, be careful.

1003
01:27:39,094 --> 01:27:42,048
Manny, you think I'm planning
to be careless?

1004
01:27:45,684 --> 01:27:47,842
What does she think she's doing?

1005
01:27:48,228 --> 01:27:50,849
Let her go.
She knows what she's doing.

1006
01:28:47,621 --> 01:28:50,491
- She must have found him.
- Oh, thank God.

1007
01:29:28,578 --> 01:29:30,535
They must have made it.

1008
01:29:31,915 --> 01:29:37,254
You see, Mr. Scott, in the water,
I'm a very skinny lady.

1009
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:54,847
They're not tugging!

1010
01:29:55,063 --> 01:29:57,305
Wait, wait, give them time.

1011
01:30:12,789 --> 01:30:16,240
I guess I'm not the champion...

1012
01:30:16,668 --> 01:30:19,539
...of the Women's Swimming
Association anymore.

1013
01:30:19,754 --> 01:30:21,877
Hold on, Mrs. Rosen. Just hold on.

1014
01:30:22,132 --> 01:30:23,959
Mr. Scott...

1015
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,460
...enough is enough.

1016
01:30:27,596 --> 01:30:29,173
Let me go.

1017
01:30:29,431 --> 01:30:31,886
Please, let me go.

1018
01:30:33,518 --> 01:30:35,427
Give this to Manny.

1019
01:30:35,687 --> 01:30:39,637
Tell him he has to give it
to our grandson...

1020
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:41,691
...for both of us.

1021
01:30:43,904 --> 01:30:46,477
You see, that's the sign for life.

1022
01:30:49,492 --> 01:30:53,158
Life always matters very much.

1023
01:31:08,803 --> 01:31:10,879
Oh, God.

1024
01:31:12,223 --> 01:31:14,845
God, not this woman.

1025
01:31:17,437 --> 01:31:20,272
Oh, God, not this woman.

1026
01:31:21,816 --> 01:31:24,521
Something's happened.
Belle would've signaled.

1027
01:31:24,736 --> 01:31:27,405
- They've had enough time.
- That does it.

1028
01:31:27,614 --> 01:31:31,528
- I'll go find out what happened.
- No, you'll drown too!

1029
01:31:31,743 --> 01:31:34,115
- Let me go, it's my wife!
- Let him go.

1030
01:31:34,329 --> 01:31:37,780
I'm going through.
All of you stay put until I come back.

1031
01:31:37,999 --> 01:31:40,537
- Give me that flashlight.
- Mike, please!

1032
01:31:40,752 --> 01:31:43,208
Take it easy, baby, I'll be back.

1033
01:32:58,955 --> 01:33:02,075
What the hell happened?
You didn't pull on the rope.

1034
01:33:02,292 --> 01:33:03,916
I got trapped.

1035
01:33:04,336 --> 01:33:06,375
Mrs. Rosen freed me.

1036
01:33:07,047 --> 01:33:10,996
Thanks, Mrs. Rosen.
If it hadn't been for you, none of us...

1037
01:33:14,846 --> 01:33:17,254
Oh, Jesus.

1038
01:33:19,059 --> 01:33:21,016
Go back and get the others.

1039
01:33:21,311 --> 01:33:23,553
- What'll I tell him?
- Tell him nothing!

1040
01:33:23,772 --> 01:33:25,599
Just go back and get them!

1041
01:33:34,407 --> 01:33:36,649
You had a lot of guts, lady.

1042
01:33:40,664 --> 01:33:42,490
A lot of guts.

1043
01:34:29,713 --> 01:34:30,911
I'm okay, baby.

1044
01:34:31,339 --> 01:34:34,459
- I'm okay.
- Belle, is she all right?

1045
01:34:35,093 --> 01:34:39,305
She got through. She saved Scott.
She cleared the way for all of us.

1046
01:34:39,848 --> 01:34:41,508
She got through.

1047
01:34:42,267 --> 01:34:44,343
But something went wrong, didn't it?

1048
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:53,601
Like I told you, she did everything.
Mr. Rosen, follow that rope!

1049
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:55,981
Something did go wrong.

1050
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:58,909
She got through. Now listen to me.

1051
01:34:59,117 --> 01:35:04,075
I want you all to step up here, take
deep breaths and swim along that rope.

1052
01:35:04,289 --> 01:35:06,412
You'll be in the engine room soon.

1053
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:10,243
It is above water like
the preacher said. You kids first.

1054
01:35:10,462 --> 01:35:14,127
I can swim three pool lengths
underwater, but Sis can only do two.

1055
01:35:14,341 --> 01:35:15,586
Okay, kid.

1056
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,636
Now don't forget.
Take a couple of deep breaths.

1057
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:22,806
All right, go.

1058
01:35:29,981 --> 01:35:32,188
I can't swim.

1059
01:35:33,443 --> 01:35:34,474
You can't swim?

1060
01:35:34,736 --> 01:35:37,309
No, not a stroke.

1061
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:51,991
Now you two.

1062
01:35:52,212 --> 01:35:54,917
Mr. Rogo, would you mind going?
I'll help her.

1063
01:35:55,173 --> 01:35:58,672
All right, but let's make it snappy.
No horsing around!

1064
01:36:05,558 --> 01:36:08,595
- You really can't swim at all?
- No, I can't.

1065
01:36:08,853 --> 01:36:11,391
- But you can hold your breath.
- Yes.

1066
01:36:11,648 --> 01:36:12,763
That's all you need.

1067
01:36:13,024 --> 01:36:16,642
Start taking deep breaths and hold
the last one before you go under.

1068
01:36:16,903 --> 01:36:19,774
And hang on to my belt.
I'll pull you through.

1069
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:21,021
No.

1070
01:36:21,283 --> 01:36:24,319
You've got to, Nonnie.
I'm not leaving without you.

1071
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:27,652
You really mean that, don't you?

1072
01:36:29,874 --> 01:36:35,165
Why don't we stay behind?
We don't have to follow the others.

1073
01:36:37,173 --> 01:36:38,288
What will happen?

1074
01:36:38,883 --> 01:36:43,510
- We might still be rescued.
- Maybe, maybe not.

1075
01:36:44,389 --> 01:36:46,216
You really won't leave me?

1076
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:47,975
I'm not going without you.

1077
01:36:51,855 --> 01:36:54,144
I just have to hold my breath.

1078
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:59,820
- That's all. And don't let go of me.
- No, I won't.

1079
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,825
- Ready?
- No.

1080
01:37:06,536 --> 01:37:10,616
All right, now we'll take three deep
breaths and then we go.

1081
01:37:40,445 --> 01:37:41,690
Belle.

1082
01:38:35,584 --> 01:38:36,959
You all right, hon?

1083
01:38:50,181 --> 01:38:51,380
Help!

1084
01:38:55,061 --> 01:38:56,259
Get her!

1085
01:38:56,479 --> 01:38:58,223
Get up here!

1086
01:39:03,528 --> 01:39:05,521
Come on. Come on.

1087
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:17,744
I've seen the propeller shaft opening.
We're almost home.

1088
01:39:18,001 --> 01:39:20,670
Only we must keep moving.
Now, come on.

1089
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:25,132
- You bastard, ain't you got feelings?
- Now, look!

1090
01:39:26,885 --> 01:39:28,676
Listen to me, all of you.

1091
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,680
Mrs. Rosen is dead.
We can't bring her back.

1092
01:39:32,933 --> 01:39:36,717
But what we can do is keep moving.
That's what she would've wanted!

1093
01:39:36,978 --> 01:39:39,350
So let's keep moving, come on!
Get up!

1094
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:42,642
Get up, come on, let's keep moving.
Come on.

1095
01:39:43,777 --> 01:39:47,442
- You too, Mr. Rosen.
- No, my place is here with her.

1096
01:39:47,697 --> 01:39:49,524
God bless, Mrs. Rosen.

1097
01:39:51,493 --> 01:39:53,284
Look, Mr. Rosen....

1098
01:39:58,708 --> 01:40:00,784
The last thing she said to me was:

1099
01:40:01,002 --> 01:40:05,878
"Give this to Manny to give
to our grandson from both of us."

1100
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:10,169
Your place is with the living.

1101
01:40:13,974 --> 01:40:18,267
If you don't come with us,
her death is meaningless.

1102
01:40:20,355 --> 01:40:21,635
Now come on.

1103
01:40:25,694 --> 01:40:26,856
All right...

1104
01:40:27,487 --> 01:40:29,147
...but you go first.

1105
01:40:30,073 --> 01:40:32,908
I want to stay with her
just a while longer.

1106
01:40:34,244 --> 01:40:35,619
You got one minute.

1107
01:40:50,802 --> 01:40:52,296
All right, listen.

1108
01:40:54,973 --> 01:40:57,096
You see that red valve up there?

1109
01:40:57,767 --> 01:41:00,685
Beneath it is the entry
to the propeller shaft area.

1110
01:41:01,354 --> 01:41:03,976
The propeller shaft
is that silver thing.

1111
01:41:04,274 --> 01:41:07,725
And this catwalk is the way
we get up there.

1112
01:41:08,361 --> 01:41:09,606
Now follow me.

1113
01:41:43,647 --> 01:41:45,141
It's this way, Mr. Rosen!

1114
01:41:45,732 --> 01:41:46,930
This way!

1115
01:42:11,549 --> 01:42:15,084
We can't get through that way.
We'll have to go up.

1116
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:58,729
Stay here.

1117
01:44:45,537 --> 01:44:47,280
One more door and we're home!

1118
01:44:49,457 --> 01:44:52,661
There it is, Mr. Rogo,
just like I told you!

1119
01:44:52,877 --> 01:44:56,081
- Come on!
- The little bastard was right.

1120
01:45:05,432 --> 01:45:07,056
Linda!

1121
01:45:24,492 --> 01:45:27,778
You! Preacher!

1122
01:45:29,247 --> 01:45:33,459
You lying, murdering son of a bitch!

1123
01:45:34,502 --> 01:45:36,578
You almost suckered me in!

1124
01:45:37,756 --> 01:45:42,667
I started to believe in your promises!
That we had a chance!

1125
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:45,261
What chance?

1126
01:45:45,805 --> 01:45:47,383
You took from me...

1127
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:51,341
...the only thing I ever loved
in the whole world.

1128
01:45:52,187 --> 01:45:53,681
My Linda.

1129
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:56,138
You killed her!

1130
01:45:57,984 --> 01:45:59,526
You killed her!

1131
01:46:01,655 --> 01:46:03,446
You killed her.

1132
01:46:05,158 --> 01:46:07,234
You killed her.

1133
01:46:21,883 --> 01:46:24,505
Mr. Scott, the hot steam!

1134
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:27,004
It's blocking our escape!

1135
01:46:34,062 --> 01:46:39,103
What more do you want of us? We've
come all this way, no thanks to you!

1136
01:46:39,568 --> 01:46:42,059
We did it on our own,
no help from you!

1137
01:46:51,496 --> 01:46:56,372
We didn't ask you to fight for us!
But damn it, don't fight against us!

1138
01:46:56,793 --> 01:46:58,287
Leave us alone!

1139
01:46:59,838 --> 01:47:03,705
How many more sacrifices?
How much more blood?

1140
01:47:12,809 --> 01:47:14,967
How many more lives?!

1141
01:47:21,526 --> 01:47:23,104
Belle wasn't enough!

1142
01:47:24,863 --> 01:47:26,487
Acres wasn't!

1143
01:47:28,825 --> 01:47:30,616
Now this girl!

1144
01:47:34,205 --> 01:47:35,949
You want another life?

1145
01:47:38,168 --> 01:47:39,627
Then take me!

1146
01:48:28,343 --> 01:48:29,671
You can make it!

1147
01:48:30,887 --> 01:48:32,216
Keep going!

1148
01:48:34,599 --> 01:48:35,880
Rogo!

1149
01:48:37,435 --> 01:48:38,550
Get them through!

1150
01:48:59,916 --> 01:49:02,586
What are you doing?! Come here!
Susan. Now.

1151
01:49:02,836 --> 01:49:04,710
Get back here!
You can't help him now.

1152
01:49:04,963 --> 01:49:08,248
Susan, get back here!

1153
01:49:08,508 --> 01:49:13,419
Susan, come here!
Susan, come here!

1154
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:18,425
Get up here. Get up here.
Come on. No.

1155
01:49:23,023 --> 01:49:25,015
What do you think you're doing?

1156
01:49:26,526 --> 01:49:29,776
You heard the reverend.
He said, "Get them through."

1157
01:49:30,488 --> 01:49:33,026
Well, go ahead. Get us through!

1158
01:49:33,283 --> 01:49:36,035
It'll be all right, Sis.
It'll be all right.

1159
01:49:36,286 --> 01:49:37,994
What kind of a policeman were you?

1160
01:49:39,122 --> 01:49:42,123
You've done nothing but beef
and complain.

1161
01:49:42,375 --> 01:49:44,866
Always negative. Always destructive.

1162
01:49:45,879 --> 01:49:49,711
Well, now's your chance to do
something positive for a change.

1163
01:49:50,091 --> 01:49:52,131
Are you quitting, Mr. Rogo?

1164
01:49:52,385 --> 01:49:55,837
Are you going out with a whimper?
On your belly?

1165
01:50:00,936 --> 01:50:04,518
All right, you, that's enough!

1166
01:50:18,536 --> 01:50:22,665
Pull yourself together, Susan. Robin,
take care of your sister. Go ahead.

1167
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:25,371
Nonnie, follow them.

1168
01:50:26,878 --> 01:50:28,456
Are you coming, Mr. Rosen?

1169
01:51:09,337 --> 01:51:11,663
Watch it around this door. It's hot.

1170
01:51:30,901 --> 01:51:33,985
All right, now what? Dead end.

1171
01:51:34,195 --> 01:51:38,063
Excuse me, sir, but I don't think so.

1172
01:51:38,909 --> 01:51:42,609
- You don't think what, kid?
- You see, sir, I tried to tell you.

1173
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:45,865
We're in Shaft Alley.
Nowhere is the steel hull thinner.

1174
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:49,829
- This hull is only one-inch thick.
- All right...

1175
01:51:50,086 --> 01:51:52,957
Quiet! I think I hear something.

1176
01:51:57,052 --> 01:51:59,424
My God, there's somebody out there!

1177
01:52:09,272 --> 01:52:11,099
Hold it!

1178
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:13,180
Again.

1179
01:52:17,864 --> 01:52:19,239
Hold it, hold it.

1180
01:52:21,159 --> 01:52:22,357
Again.

1181
01:52:25,747 --> 01:52:28,285
Stop it, stop it! It's no use!

1182
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,579
No, keep trying!

1183
01:52:30,085 --> 01:52:33,039
Mr. Scott wouldn't have stopped.
Let's go!

1184
01:52:37,092 --> 01:52:38,634
Hold it, hold it.

1185
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:45,297
My God, there is somebody up there.

1186
01:52:56,319 --> 01:53:01,740
The preacher was right. The beautiful
son of a bitch was right!

1187
01:53:05,161 --> 01:53:07,487
Look. Look!

1188
01:53:10,875 --> 01:53:12,667
Get back. Get back.
